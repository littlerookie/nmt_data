Oh, I get it.
I put some... Most of you in here.
Yes, you did.
I can understand you feeling some kind of way about that.
what?
so I'm gonna do me and I'm gonna let you do you.
I don't want no trouble.
all right?
I just wanna go to my cell.
that ain't gonna happen. - Nope.
excuse me.
excuse me, please.
deadly.
if you don't move, your head is going up his ass.
y'all fellas sure you wanna ride this train?
choo, choo, asshole.
get him out! Get him out!
did you shove a man's head up another man's ass?
we're gonna... We're gonna circle back to that.
the DA's office wants your sentence to run eight years.
it's a big number, but not something we didn't anticipate.
you know, our plan is... What are you doing?
it sounded like you said they want me to spend eight years in this shithole.
eight is more like four and a half with good behavior.
but it's irrelevant because with you out of the picture...
...and with the crime rate going up through the roof...
...the DA and the cops, they're all gonna call for your immediate release.
they're gonna demand it. Where are you going? Sit down.
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.
stop it. Hancock. - Move.
Hancock! - Get back!
you're being a coward!
who you talking to? - I'm talking to you.
who are you talking to, Ray? - Stop pretending that you do not care.
you have a calling. You're a hero, Hancock.
you're gonna be miserable the rest of your life until you accept that.
trust me. Trust this plan, this process. Just stay in here.
when they call, a hero's what we're gonna give them.
how we gonna do that, Ray?
all right, guys, let's start sharing.
don? You had something? - Yeah.
Yeah, I think I might've had a little bit of a breakthrough.
good for you.
Yeah, I mean, I realized that breaking necks is... It's easy.
but I'm sitting there and I'm staring at myself in the mirror...
...and I thought, "This is tough." - Yeah, it sounds tough.
why do you always laugh?
picturing you looking at the mirror. It would scare the shit out of me.
every time I'm talking, he completely ruins the cycle.
now, let's watch the crosstalk.
I'm not gonna share anymore if he keeps doing that.
no, no, no.
keep sharing. - Let's move on.
Mr. Hancock, do you wanna share today?
pass.
your landing is your first impression. It's your superhero handshake.
don't come in too hot, okay? Don't come in too boozy.
and don't land on a $ 100, 000 Mercedes. All right?
people have to be happy that you've arrived.
Mr. Hancock, your share.
pass.
so you've used the door and the building's still intact.
people are happy that you've arrived. They feel safe.
there's an officer and he's done a good job...
...so tell him he's done a good job.
what the hell did I have to come for if he's done a good job?
Oh, man!
KBLA radio, AM 850.
today's big story, no surprise here: Hancock. What's your take?
I, for one, have had enough of this guy.
I'm glad he's doing time around bars and I hope they don't let him off easy.
let my cousin Pookie out.
I see you don't wear a bulletproof vest, security officer.
I respect your courage...
...because bullets don't bounce off you, they bounce off me.
this city is being run by gangs and drug dealers.
Hancock makes them shake in their boots.
he doesn't tie a pretty ribbon around it, but he gets the job done.
besides, he's hot.
let me hear you say it. Let me hear you say, "Good job."
G...
goo...
Mr. Hancock, would you like to share?
pass. - Good.
good.
good j...
good j...
good job.
good job.
jail watch, day five, and true to his word, Hancock remains incarcerated.
meanwhile, crime is still on the rise.
the L. A.P. D. Is reporting increases of up to 30 percent...
...in the last five days that Hancock has been behind bars.
Hancock! Hey, Hancock! - Hey, little buddy.
Hancock. We brought you something! - Hey, hey.
Hey, what's up, Hancock?
Where's...? Where's Ray?
no, it's just us. Ray's working.
aaron really wanted to come and see you...
...so we just dropped by with some Spaghetti Madness.
I should probably let the guard check for keys...
no, no. Here. - Okay. Here you go.
Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh?
just dig in. - Oh, man, look at that. Look at that.
that's a good meatball. - Thanks, Hancock.
ray is a good man.
whatever this is you're doing, don't let him down.
okay?
okay. Well, we should probably go, buddy.
already? I wanna stay with Hancock. - Yeah. Sweetheart...
...we have to go. Come on, say goodbye to Hancock.
here, Hancock. It's my favorite one, and I want you to have it.
that was very sweet. - Thanks, Mom.
come here.
Mr. Hancock, would you like to share?
pass.
all right. Phillip?
I love you guys, man.
we love you. - We love you too, Phillip.
for when they call.
I ain't wearing that, Ray. - Yes, you are.
Oh, no, I'm not. - No, you are.
actually, I'm not, Ray.
you think you're not, but you are.
I will fight crime butt-ass naked before I fight it in that, Ray.
you know, you have fought naked. We've got that. That's on YouTube.
Hancock, this is a uniform. A uniform represents purpose.
doctors, policemen, firemen, right?
it represents a calling. - It's been two weeks.
yeah? - Nobody out there is missing me, Ray.
just be patient. You gotta trust me on this. All right?
perimeter breach, perimeter breach.
asshole!
you're still a fake-ass punk.
Damn!
Mr. Hancock?
it's your share.
pass.
come on, man, try it. Let it out. - Come on, John.
I don't have nothing.
there's nothing on your mind? Come on, John.
it's cool, man. - Come on.
come on. - Do it.
first time for everything.
feels good to release, now. - Let it heal. Come on, man, try it.
come in here all these days, you don't have anything to share?
I'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff.
all right. Thanks for sharing.
okay. - Thank you.
all right. - That's awesome.
that's a clap. Yeah. - There you go. Good share.
Hey, Hancock.
come on, get up.
you got a phone call. - Take a message.
it's the chief of police.
he says he needs your help.
the trapped officer's husband is Corporal Joseph Blake...
...who was killed last year in Iraq...
...Leaving her two small children. We are waiting for the latest news...
...but apparently there are three suspects and...
what's going on?
I'm out!
stay down! Stay down!
stay down!
get out! - Get down!
get it down!
let's go! Everybody's gotta get back! Let's go!
back! Move!
we got perimeters set up on the north, east and south sides.
the west side is open.
don't break the building, don't break the building.
what?
it's a little tight. What you got?
bank job. I got at least eight hostages. Four bad guys.
officer pinned down. We can't get to her.
they been spraying the hell out of us all morning. And...
they got some kind of heavy artillery. Fifty caliber or bigger.
I don't know if that matters to you. - No, I'm good.
good job.
good job.
really, good job.
get down!
it's Hancock!
take him out!
good job!
do I have permission to touch your body?
Yes!
it's not sexual.
not that you're not an attractive woman.
he's on the move!
he's moving, he's moving!
good job.
are you hit anywhere? - My leg!
Hancock! - Good job.
you said that. I need you to end this now.
check the flanks.
secure the perimeter.
spread out!
they're gonna come around the back.
what happened to him?
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
what is happening?
I heard you was in the slammer. - Out early.
Why's that? - Good behavior.
do you know what this is?
I'm guessing it's some kind of detonator-type deal.
there's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped to each and every one of them.
this is a spring-loaded dead man's switch.
if my thumb comes off it:
boom!
and now, since we've had a little change of plan...
...Between the police showing up...
..and you sucking out all of my associates...
...I want you to break into the vault.
you'll find three quarter-ton pallets of small bills inside.
thirty million dollars.
and you're gonna carry it for me.
you are gonna get me safely away from here with the money...
...or else they'll be cleaning up these hostages with a mop.
I'm gonna have to say no to that.
I'm really trying to turn over a new leaf.
I will blow up this entire building, you asshole.
I really don't like that word.
I will blow them sky-high...
...and their blood will be on your hands.
do you hear me, asshole?
call me a asshole...
...one more time.
ass...
go, go, go. Move in! - Go on, you're safe!
let's go. Let's go. - Take it right in. Let's go.
bring it around now.
keep your hand on that trigger.
good job. - No. You, good job.
thank you. - Good job.
Hancock!
say hi to your fans. Look what you got.
here we go. This way.
Hancock. At the bank today, intense. - Thank you.
smile.
good job, Hancock!
Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody in here, huh?
Hancock, meet these guys. This is Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.
gigantic fans. Insane!
these guys are partners at the biggest ad firm.
you never call, man.
I have called. A couple of times. - Water under the bridge, man.
could you guys get used to this or what?
how'd you two meet?
I was married once before.
first wife...
...she died giving birth to Aaron.
it's another dinner. But... But...
so there I am, I'm with this beautiful little baby.
I don't know what the hell to do.
and I was in the supermarket...
...and I'm in the baby aisle...
...and I've got a brand of diapers in each hand.
I'm staring at them, but I don't know how I'm gonna get through the day.
an angel...
...sees me.
she knew. She was... She gave me this look.
and even in the trance I was in, I knew that somebody somewhere...
...was throwing me a little rope.
you know?
starting that day, you really put my life back together. Right?
you're drunk. - So? Come here.
what about you, buddy?
you're from another planet, aren't you?
no, man, I'm from Miami.
you didn't come in on, like, a meteor or...?
Nope. Woke up in a hospital, first thing I remember.
government hospital, yes? Experimenting on you and...
no, Ray. Regular old Miami emergency room.
come on. - My skull was fractured.
they told me I tried to stop a mugging.
somebody knocked you out. - I guess I was a regular guy before...
...and when I woke up, I was changed.
the hospital nurse tried to put a needle in my arm...
...and it just broke against my skin.
and then my skull healed in, like, an hour.
the doctors were astounded...
...and they wanted to know my story.
just like you. But I couldn't tell them. I don't know who I am.
amnesia.
you know, the blow to the head. - Yeah, well, that's what they figured.
you don't remember anything? - No.
only thing I had in my pocket was...
...Bubble gum...
...Two movie tickets.
boris Karloff, Frankenstein.
but no ID, nothing.
I went to sign out, the nurse asked me for my John Hancock.
I actually thought that's who I was.
how come I didn't hear any of this, didn't read about it in any newspapers?
it was probably in the papers 80 years ago.
eighty years ago?
Oh, I don't age. This is it.
that's nice. - Gotta wonder, though:
what kind of bastard must I have been...
...that nobody was there to claim me?
I mean, I'm not the most charming guy in the world...
...so I've been told, but...
...Nobody?
whoever it was they'd be dead by now, anyway.
Hey, Mary. You all right, baby?
Yeah. Too much wine.
I am a lightweight.
I'm sorry.
you ain't do nothing.
this was a nice dinner, Ray.
it was a good one. - Almost call this fun.
that didn't tire you out, coming up the stairs?
not really. - I'm real spinny.
could've just flown me upstairs.
I could've done without that. - Get your shoes off here.
all right, that's all you're getting off of me though.
you believe in me, don't you, Hancock?
of course, Ray. I believe in you. - Help me up here.
I got something to say to you.
listen to me. This is important.
you are like a Dodger Dog.
it's something people don't think they're gonna like...
...then they try it and they love it, right? It hits the spot.
it's good for the soul. You're like the world's Dodger Dog.
I don't know. But you know what I mean, right?
you're gonna do great.
you're gonna fix everything.
you get some sleep, Ray. - You sleep tight too.
Hancock tucking me in.
all right, he's asleep.
okay, thanks. Good night. - Good night.
look, I just don't want you to think that... That Ray...
...you know, drinks like that, because...
Oh, no. - This was just kind of...
...a celebratory night. - No, I understand.
Yeah, I know that. - Okay.
the damn babysitter never cleans up after herself.
you have a bruise on your hand.
Yeah, I don't... I don't know what that is.
I've been feeling kind of funny.
you...
you should go.
getting late.
if Ray finds out about me...
...you're dead.
Joan, we're gonna take care of that, okay? Don't you worry.
Hi, honey.
breakfast?
Hancock sneezed, huh?
can you believe it? It's amazing that you slept through that.
you're a good sleeper. - Holy shit.
I'm not gonna say I told you so, but...
you told me he was gonna sneeze a hole through the house?
I just said him being around...
Oh, sweetheart, can you get that? Thanks.
Oh, God, you strong man. - I got it.
but you don't worry about anything.
I already apologized to the neighbors. Called State Farm.
everything is taken care of.
you just...
...Enjoy that breakfast.
what's this? Are we going on vacation? Are we?
just the three of us.
end of the summer? - Tonight.
tonight? - Spur of the moment.
tonight might be a little tough. - Come on. The three of us?
me in a bikini?
sounds good. - Let's go somewhere.
knock, knock.
Gesundheit.
I was just telling Ray here, I hope you're done sneezing...
...because I don't think our house could take much more...of your sneezing.
Yeah, sometimes I sneeze when there's dust...
...or if I get really surprised.
that's unfortunate. This is Kilbourne.
Mike? How you doing?
it was great to see you too.
Yep. Well...
right. Go ahead, shoot.
okay. I got a pen right here.
right. No, I know.
it's right here in my hand.
I am warning you.
all right, go ahead.
okay, good.
now... And that's still in 310, right?
hang on one second.
do me a favor?
I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah.
we're gonna talk.
go away.
well, it is something that I'm really excited about.
I'm gonna do this all day. - Shut... Shut up.
I... I suppose...
fine. We'll talk, okay? - We will.
and when we're done talking, you go away and you leave my family alone.
my place at 4: 00. - Whatever.
it means... Well, I'd rather not talk numbers now.
I'd like to save them for the pitch. So let's just set a time.
that's good with me. I will see you then. All right.
Yeah, 3: 30. Great.
hon, is it hot in here?
he hurt you, didn't he?
come on, use your words.
how did it make you feel?
sore.
bad.
bad.
it's because he took your power. And you have to get your power back.
and no one will give you your power back. You have to go out and take it.
you understand me?
we're gonna go find Hancock...
...and get your power back.
well, I'm here.
Yup.
you wanna do it? - Do what?
I don't have time for this, okay? You ask the questions...
...I answer them honestly and then you leave L. A.
I ain't leaving L. A.
all right, all right. Jeez.
don't.
ask.
you and I. - "You and l" what?
we're the same. - No.
I'm stronger.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
who are we?
gods, angels. Different cultures call us by different names.
now all of a sudden, it's "superhero."
are there more of us? - There were.
they all died.
it's just the two of us.
what is this?
who are we to each other?
we're brother and sister. - That's a lie.
no, I'm your sister. - That is a lie.
I'm your sister. - That is a lie.
sisters don't kiss brothers the way you kissed me last night.
you're lying, deal's off.
let's go see how Ray feels about this.
get your ass back here!
I'm telling!
the All Heart symbol will be known globally...
...as a symbol...
...that represents companies that are committed to changing the world.
they can give away their sustenance goods, okay?
food, drugs, power, clothing, for free.
we were talking about Hancock... - Number two.
you stay away from me and my family.
you are not gonna do this to me again.
what? I don't know what you're talking about.
Hey! - I love you, Hancock!
it can't work. It always ends the same way.
persia. Greece. Brooklyn.
Brooklyn? I've never been to Brooklyn.
I have put up with your bullshit for 3000 years...
...and I am done! Done, you listening?
I don't know what you're talking about! - Finally, I am happy!
you are not gonna mess with that! - I don't know what you're talking about!
I hate to burst your little crazy-lady bubble...
...but it must not have been all that great because I don't remember you.
call me crazy...
...one more time.
cuckoo.
all right, hold it. All right.
you better not hit me with that truck.
for companies to qualify, they need to prove they are a leader in the global...
we wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.
they're committed to bettering the world.
they can do this in four ways. This is how they...
the most important thing with All Heart is brand recognition.
I've mocked up these examples here...
...in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris.
Oh, no.
we need maximum exposure, market penetra...
is it snowing?
stop. Stop it.
stop. Stop. Stop! All right, let's just...
get off me!
get off me!
stop. Stop!
get off!
get off me! - Listen to me!
I hate you! - I am sorry!
whoever I am, whatever I did... Look at me.
I'm sorry.
I don't remember.
you are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
Oh, my God.
why were you flying? You were flying, Mary.
Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray. - Okay, I was flying.
and I'm very strong as well.
it's just the way we are. - "We"?
me and him, it's just us now. The others paired up and died.
you didn't say anything about pairing up at the trailer.
you were at his trailer. - This is hard to explain.
great, I'm all ears. - Me too.
do me a favor, just give me and my wife one moment.
don't bring it here, Ray. - The adults are talking.
technically speaking...
...he's my husband.
holy shit.
what? - We broke up decades ago.
long before you were born. He just can't remember.
but you can, right? You knew?
that's something you bring up on a first date, Mary.
I don't like to travel. I'm allergic to cats. I'm immortal.
those are some things you give a heads-up on.
whatever we are, we were built in twos, okay?
we're drawn to each other.
no matter how far I run, he's always there.
he finds me. It's physics.
are you saying that you two are fated to be together?
I've lived for a very long time, Ray.
and the one thing I learned...
...Fate doesn't decide everything.
people get to choose.
and you chose...
...to let me think I was here alone.
I didn't think you'd miss what you didn't remember.
great. Now what?
I didn't plan for this.
prison authorities confirmed...
...that the prisoner uprising was led by Kenneth "Red" Parker, Jr...
...who was also the leader of last week's Spring Street bank robbery.
at least eight prisoners are not accounted for.
more information on the prison riot in Norwalk.
construction workers at the prison were knocked unconscious.
the prisoners stole the workers' clothes...
...and it's feared at least some of them have escaped.
Parker is considered a criminal mastermind.
he is very effective at using psychological persuasion...
...to organize criminals from different backgrounds.
he is a former psychology professor from Stanford University.
while there, he organized a notorious criminal network...
...Comprised of graduate students from diverse...
ninety-one ten.
ninety-one ten? You gotta be shitting me.
ninety-one ten.
Highway robbery.
911
what? - I'm taking the money.
I can relate to that.
you know? If you want something...
...Nobody can stop you from taking it...
...you just take it, right?
I like that.
but can you take it?
my Zagnut bar versus your gun.
sorry about your window.
I need Room 1020. - Clear!
I need Room 1020.
I need IV line, blood quality, CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and...
Where's his IV line?
that's not gonna work. - I'm in.
what's happening?
this just in. John Hancock has been rushed...
...to Los Angeles General Hospital.
Hancock is in serious condition with multiple gunshot wounds.
no story yet as to how this happened to him...
...but we will continue to cover this story live. Reporting live from L. A...
mercy GENERAL HOSPITAL - Any lead on the assailant? - Mr. Embrey!
just a couple of questions, sir, please.
can you describe how it happened?
from what I've heard, he was trying to stop a robbery.
do you know if special ammunition was used in the gun that shot him?
not that I'm aware of.
could this have to do with the mysterious woman?
he was seen battling her. - I do not have that answer.
could this woman be more powerful than Hancock?
here are the lab results for 209.
you're becoming mortal.
it's us...
...being close to each other.
it's never happened this fast before.
you have to leave.
the further you get from me, the better you're gonna feel.
you'll start getting your powers back...
...and be flying and breaking things...
...and saving people before you know it.
well, it's like I said, we were built in pairs.
and when we get close to our opposites, we lose our power.
Why? - So we can live human lives.
love, connect...
...Grow old, die.
what happened to us?
summer of 4 B. C.
we were becoming mortal, like now.
they came after me with swords.
but you saved me.
1850
they set our house on fire.
you pulled me out of the flames.
eighty years ago.
what happened then?
we were living in Miami...
...and a new movie was playing in town.
Frankenstein.
and after...
...we walked down Flagler Street...
...and you took my hand, and you held it so tight.
and they attacked us in an alley.
they hit you so hard. There was so much blood.
they wouldn't let me ride in the ambulance with you.
and by the time I got to the hospital, you were awake.
but you didn't know me.
so I left.
every time we're together...
...they come after you through me.
you're built to save people more than the rest of us.
that's who you are. You're a hero.
the insurance policy of the gods.
keep one alive. You.
to protect this world.
Mary!
mom!
Mary! - Stay down!
okay.
Mary?
stop.
Oh, no! No! Please!
stay down.
Hey! Mary!
let's go, get her up!
come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go.
morphine. - Here. Help in here!
hold her down. Hold her down.
hold her down.
hold her down.
you want the monitor now? - Stay calm.
hold her, hold her, hold her. - Need EKG leads.
upon us all, Hancock.
you're no different.
time to shut her down, Hancock.
it's been a nice run.
Oh, we are all sincerely gonna miss you.
but it is time for you to move on.
and maybe to a happier place.
you can thank me if you want to...
...Superhero.
you didn't!
Aaron!
one MONTH LATER - What about Attila the Hun? - Completely cross-eyed.
cross-eyed? - Yep.
all right, what about Queen Elizabeth?
needy. - J. F. K? What about him?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, "yeah"? Anything more?
not like that. I was in Cuba for the whole missile thing.
Yeah, hang on.
Hello? - Ray.
Hey, I've been trying to call you.
Yeah, I was out of cell range.
are you outside? - Yeah.
look up. - All right, I'm looking up.
I'm looking up.
baby? - What?
you're gonna change the world.
good job, Ray. - Oh, my God, Ray.
Hey. Look up.
Hancock.
I'm proud of you.
Thanks.
will I get in trouble for that?
NYPD - Freeze! - Don't move!
Oh, my God! Sam! No! - Drop your weapon, sir!
get back! Get back! Get back!
drop it! - Get back or I'll shoot! Get back!
get back! I'm not playing.
get back. Get back!
damn, Handjob. Where you come from?
all right, relax. Just tell me what you need.
tell them cops to take their guns off of me.
all right. - Tell them to take the guns off me.
just take them off. Lower your weapons.
you're gonna get us out of here with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.
now let's make it happen, asshole.
the END
legend tells of a legendary warrior...
...whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend.
he traveled the land in search of worthy foes.
I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist!
the warrior said nothing, for his mouth was full.
then he swallowed. And then he spoke.
enough talk. Let's fight!
Shashabooey!
he was so deadly in fact, that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness.
my eyes! - He's too awesome!
and attractive. - How can we repay you?
there is no charge for awesomeness.
or attractiveness.
kablooey!
it mattered not how many foes he faced.
they were no match for his bodacity!
never before had a panda been so feared! And so loved.
even the most heroic heroes in China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master.
we should hang out.
agreed.
but hanging out would have to wait.
because when you're facing the 10, 000 demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters and that's...
Po! Get up!
you'll be later for work!
what?
Po! Get up!
Po. What are you doing up there?
nothing.
monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.
coming!
sorry, Dad.
sorry doesn't make the noodles.
what were you doing up there? All that noise.
nothing. I just had a crazy dream.
about what?
what were you dreaming about?
what was I?
I was dreaming about...
...noodles.
noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles?
Yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?
careful! That soup is sharp.
Oh, happy day!
my son, finally having the noodle dream!
you don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment.
this is a sign, Po.
a sign of what?
you are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant!
as I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father...
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.
dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.
no, it was the dream.
we are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins.
but, Dad, didn't you ever want to do something else?
something besides noodles?
actually, when I was young and crazy,
I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.
why didn't you?
because it was a stupid dream.
can you imagine me making tofu?
tofu.
No! We all have our place in this world.
mine is here, and yours is...
I know, is here.
no, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12
service with a smile.
well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me.
Tigress, you need more ferocity! Monkey, greater speed.
crane, height. Viper, subtlety. Mantis...
master Shifu. - What?!
it's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.
master Oogway, you summoned me? Is something wrong?
why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?
so, nothing's wrong?
well, I didn't say that.
you were saying?
I have had a vision.
Tai Lung will return.
that is impossible! He is in prison.
nothing is impossible.
Zeng!
fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons, double everything!
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!
Yes, Master Shifu!
one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
we must do something! We can't let him march on the valley, take his revenge!
he'll...
your mind is like this water, my friend.
when it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see.
but if you allow it to settle...
...the answer becomes clear.
the Dragon Scroll.
it is time.
but who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power?
to become the Dragon Warrior?
I don't know.
excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.
watch it!
sorry. Suck it up!
sorry. A thousand pardons.
what?
master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today!
everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!
we've waited 1, 000 years for this! Take the bowl!
this is the greatest day in kung fu history! Just go!
Po! Where are you going?
to the Jade Palace.
you're forgetting your noodle cart.
the whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them.
selling noodles?
but, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...
yeah? - I was thinking maybe I...
...could also sell the bean buns. They're about to go bad.
that's my boy!
I told you that dream was a sign.
Yeah. Glad I had it.
I'm a kung fu warrior! - Me, too!
there's spots at the top. - Let's go.
come on. Come on!
almost there.
what?
No! Oh, no!
sorry, Po. - We'll bring you back a souvenir.
no. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
it is an historic day.
isn't it, Master Oogway?
Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see.
are your students ready?
Yes, Master Oogway.
know this, old friend.
whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the valley...
...but also to you.
let the tournament begin!
no, no, wait!
I'm coming! Wait, wait!
Yes!
Hey! Open the door!
let me in!
citizens of the Valley of Peace, it is my great honor to present to you... Tigress!
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!
the Furious Five!
Yeah, the Furious Five!
warriors, prepare!
wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.
ready for battle! - Yeah.
the Thousand Tongues of Fire.
look at that.
Hey! Get out of the way!
and finally Master Tigress!
and believe me, citizens, you have not seen anything yet.
I know!
master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death.
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.
citizens of the Valley of Peace,
master Oogway will now choose the Dragon Warrior!
Oh, no! No, no, wait!
Yeah.
Po!
what are you doing?!
what does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!
but I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream!
I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad.
I love kung fu!
come on, son. Let's get back to work.
OK.
come back!
what's going on?
where?
what are you pointing?
OK. Sorry.
I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.
how interesting.
master, are you pointing at me?
him. - Who?
you. - Me?
the universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!
what? - What?!
What?! - What?!
stop, wait! Who told you to?
master Oogway, wait.
that flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to our problem.
you were about to point at Tigress and that thing fell in front of her!
that was just an accident!
there are no accidents.
forgive us, Master. We have failed you.
no. If the panda has not quit by morning then I will have failed you.
wait! Wait, wait, wait! I bring a message...
...from Master Shifu.
What?!
double the guard?!
extra precautions?!
your prison may not be adequate?!
you doubt my prison security?!
absolutely not.
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.
I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu.
escape from Chorh-Gom prison is impossible!
impressive, isn't it?
it's very impressive.
it's very impressive.
one way in, one way out.
one thousand guards and one prisoner.
Yes, except that prisoner...
...is Tai Lung.
take us down.
what are you doing?
Oh, my.
behold Tai Lung.
I'm just gonna wait right here.
it's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe.
crossbows! At the ready!
Crossbows?
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.
don't get him mad.
what's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized.
did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?
I'm good. I've seen enough.
I'll tell Shifu he has nothing to worry about.
no, he doesn't.
I'll tell him that.
can we please go now?
dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
wait a second!
I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm...
the Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!
look at this place.
master Flying Rhino's armor, with authentic battle damage!
the Sword of Heroes!
said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking.
the Invisible Trident of Destiny!
I've only seen paintings of that painting.
No!
the legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors.
said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu Army.
hello.
have you finished sight-seeing?
sorry, I should have come to you first.
my patience is wearing thin.
well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere.
would you turn around? - Sure.
how's it going?
how do you get 5, 000... Master Shifu!
someone... broke that.
but I'll fix it. Do you have some...
...glue?
a splinter.
so you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?
I guess so. - Wrong!
you are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until...
...you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.
so, how does this work?
do you have a ladder, or a trampoline, or?
you think it's that easy? That I'll just hand you the secret - to limitless power? - No, I...
one must first master the highest level of kung fu.
and that is impossible if that one is someone like you.
someone like me?
Yes, look at you! This fat butt! Flabby arms!
those are sensitive in the flabby parts.
and this ridiculous belly.
and utter disregard for personal hygiene.
now, wait a minute. That's uncalled for.
don't stand that close. I can smell your breath.
listen, Oogway said I was...
the Wuxi Finger Hold. Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!
Oh, you know this hold?
developed by Master Wuxi in the Third Dynasty.
then you know what happens when I flex my pinky.
no, no! - You know the hardest part of this?
the hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.
OK, OK, take it easy.
now listen closely, panda.
Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you,
I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear?
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.
good.
I can't wait to get started.
let's begin. - Wait, wait, wait.
what?
now? - Yes, now.
unless the great Oogway was wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior.
Oh, OK, well...
I don't know if I can do all of those moves.
well, if we don't try, we'll never know, will we?
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level.
what level is that?
well, I'm not a master, but...
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.
no. There is no such thing as level zero.
maybe I can start with that. - That?
we use that for training children and propping the door open when it's hot.
but if you insist...
the Furious Five!
you're bigger than your action figures. Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.
go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do.
are they gonna watch, or should I wait till they get back to work?
hit it.
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate. So I'm still digesting.
so my kung fu might not be as good as... later on.
just hit it.
all right.
what you got? You got nothing, 'cause I got it right here.
you picking on my friends? Get ready to feel thunder.
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.
come on. I'm a blur. You've never seen bear style.
you've only seen praying mantis.
or monkey style.
or I could come at you snickety-snake.
would you hit it!
all right. All right.
why don't you try again? A little harder.
how's that?
that hurts.
this will be easier than I thought.
I'm feeling a little nauseous!
those are hard!
my tenders.
how did I do?
there is now a level zero.
there's no words. - No denying that.
what was Master Oogway thinking?
the poor guy's gonna get himself killed.
he is so mighty!
the Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire!
when he walks, the very ground shakes!
one would think Master Oogway would choose someone who knew kung fu.
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.
or even see his toes.
OK.
great.
Hi. You're up.
I am now.
I was just...
some day, huh?
that kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Are your biceps sore?
I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so...
Yeah, I should probably get to sleep now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. - OK, thanks.
it's just... Man, I'm such a big fan!
you guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River.
outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop. You just...
sorry about that.
look, you don't belong here.
I know. I know. You're right.
I don't have... I just...
my whole life I dreamed of...
no, I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room. This is my room.
property of Crane.
OK. Right, right.
so, you want to get to sleep.
Yeah. - I'm keeping you up.
we got big things tomorrow.
all right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.
what was that?
I didn't say anything.
OK. All right. Good night.
sleep well.
that seemed a little awkward.
master Tigress! I didn't mean to wake you.
you don't belong here. - Yeah, of course.
this is your room.
I mean, you don't belong in the Jade Palace.
you're a disgrace to kung fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning.
big fan!
I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
is that what this is? Sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
I understand. You eat when you are upset.
upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset.
so why are you so upset?
I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu.
in the history of China. In the history of sucking!
probably.
and the Five! Man, you should've seen them! They totally hate me.
totally.
how is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior?
I mean, I'm not like the Five.
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.
even Mantis has those... thingies.
maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.
quit, don't quit.
noodles, don't noodles.
you are too concerned with what was and what will be.
there's a saying:
yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift.
that is why it is called the present.
Oh, no! - What's happening?!
to your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!
fire crossbows!
fire!
fire!
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.
not going anywhere! Neither is he! - Let go of me!
bring it up!
wait! Bring it back!
he's coming this way! - He won't get far. Archers!
we're dead. So very, very dead.
not yet we're not. Now!
can we run now? - Yes.
I'm glad Shifu sent you.
I was beginning to think I'd been forgotten.
fly back there and tell them...
...the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
good morning, Master!
panda!
panda!
wake up!
he's quit.
what do we do now, with the panda gone? Who will be the Dragon Warrior?
all we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.
what are you doing here?!
Hi! Good morning, Master!
I thought I'd warm up a little.
you're stuck.
stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?
Nah. This is one of my... Yeah, I'm stuck.
help him. - Oh, dear.
maybe on three. One, two...
...three.
thank you. - Don't mention it.
no, really, I appreciate... - Ever.
you actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night?
it takes years to develop one's flexibility!
and years longer to apply it in combat!
put that down!
the only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
Yeah! Excellent.
let's get started.
are you ready? - I was born re...
I'm sorry, brother. I thought you said you were ready.
that was awesome! Let's go again!
I've been taking it easy on you, panda. But no more.
your next opponent will be me.
all right! Yeah, let's go!
step forth.
the true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness...
...and make him suffer for it.
Oh, yeah!
to take his strength and use it against him...
...until he finally falls...
...or quits.
a real warrior never quits.
don't worry, Master. I will never quit!
if he's smart, he won't come back up those steps.
but he will.
he's not going to quit, is he?
he's not going to quit bouncing, I'll tell you that.
I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.
trust me, it will.
it's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this...
fat? - Fur. I was going to say fur.
sure you were.
who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me.
I'm over here.
maybe you should look at this again.
Oh, OK.
stop it. Stop!
I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all...
...but if I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.
I know he can seem kind of heartless...
...but he wasn't always like that.
according to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.
No! - Yes.
but that was before.
before what?
before Tai Lung.
we're not really supposed to talk about him.
well, if he's going to stay here, he should know.
guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.
he was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.
and then he turned bad, and now he's in jail.
he wasn'tjust a student.
Shifu found him as a cub...
...and he raised him as his son.
and when the boy showed talent in kung fu...
...Shifu trained him.
he believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.
it was never enough for Tai Lung.
he wanted the Dragon Scroll.
but Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.
outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley.
he tried to take the scroll by force.
and Shifu had to destroy what he had created.
but how could he?
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before.
or since.
and now he has a chance to make things right.
to train the true Dragon Warrior.
and he's stuck with you.
a big fat panda who treats it like a joke.
that is it!
wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.
and may have also stopped his heart.
inner peace.
inner peace.
Inner...
inner peace.
would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?!
Inner...
Oh, Zeng.
excellent.
I could use some good news right now.
master! Master!
I have... It's... It's very bad news.
Shifu.
there is just news. There is no good or bad.
master, your vision. Your vision was right.
Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way.
that is bad news...
...if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
the panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.
he wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident.
there are no accidents.
Yes, I know. You've said that already.
twice. - Well, that was no accident, either.
thrice.
my old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control.
illusion?
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.
I cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time.
but there are things we can control.
I can control when the fruit will fall.
and I can control...
...where to plant the seed.
that is no illusion, Master.
Yes.
but no matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree.
you may wish for an apple or an orange, but you will get a peach.
but a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
maybe it can.
if you are willing to guide it.
to nurture it.
to believe in it.
but how? How?
I need your help, Master.
no, you just need to believe.
promise me, Shifu.
promise me you will believe.
I will try.
good.
my time has come.
you must continue your journey without me.
what are you? Wait!
master!
you can't leave me!
you must believe.
master!
Yeah, so I'm like, "Fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province...
...but you're a lousy tipper.
Really? So how did you get out of there alive?
I mean, I didn't actually say that...
...but I thought it...
...in my mind.
if he could read my mind, he'd be, like, "What?
order up! Hope you like it.
this is really good! - No, come on.
try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient.
what do you mean? This is amazing!
you're a really good cook. - I wish my mouth was bigger.
Tigress, you've got to try this.
it is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe.
I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet.
I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and universe juice.
what? - Nothing... Master Shifu.
never be the Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!
what is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it!
work hard, panda, and maybe someday...
...you will have ears like mine.
that's good.
ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good.
it's Shifu!
of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing?
master Shifu!
you think this is funny?
Tai Lung has escaped and you're acting like children!
what? - He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him.
and I was saying you got no sense of humor.
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.
what? You're serious? And I have to?
master Oogway will stop him, like he did before.
Oogway cannot!
not anymore.
our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.
the panda? - Yes, the panda!
master, let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for.
No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung.
it is his!
Where'd he go?
you cannot leave! A real warrior never quits.
watch me.
come on.
how am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs.
you will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior.
you don't believe that. You never believed that.
from the beginning, you've tried to get rid of me.
Yes! I was.
but now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine.
you're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
then why didn't you quit?! You knew I wanted you gone, yet you stayed.
Yeah, I stayed.
I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt, but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me.
I stayed because I thought, if anyone could change me...
...could make me... not me...
...it was you.
the greatest kung fu teacher in all of China!
but I can change you!
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will!
come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now.
even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you...
...gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior?
how?
how?
how?! - I don't know!
I don't know.
that's what I thought.
this is what you trained me for.
Tigress!
don't try and stop me.
we're not trying to stop you.
what?
we're coming with you!
what? I eat when I'm upset, OK?
no need to explain.
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf.
don't tell Monkey.
look at you. - Yeah, I know, I disgust you.
no, I mean, how did you get up there?
I don't know. I guess that...
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.
yet you are ten feet off the ground.
and you have done a perfect spilt.
no, this? This is just...
...an accident.
there are no accidents.
come with me.
I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fuey...
...but could you at least tell me where we're going?
you dragged me...
...all the way out here...
...for a bath?
Panda...
...we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears.
the Pool of...
this is where Oogway unraveled the mysteries...
...of harmony and focus.
this is the birthplace...
...of kung fu.
do you want to learn kung fu?
Yeah!
then I am your master!
OK!
don't cry.
OK.
when you focus on kung fu, when you concentrate...
...you stink.
perhaps that is my fault.
I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five.
I now see that the way to get through to you...
...is with this.
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.
good.
when you have been trained, you may eat.
let us begin.
after you, panda.
just like that?
no sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?
I vowed to train you, and you have been trained. You are free to eat.
enjoy.
Hey!
I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling.
Hey!
you are free to eat.
am I?! - Are you?!
I'm not hungry.
master.
cut it!
Where's the Dragon Warrior?
how do you know you're not looking at her?
you think I'm a fool?
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you!
I heard how he fell out of the sky in a ball of fire.
that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.
Po? - So that is his name. Po.
finally, a worthy opponent.
our battle will be legendary!
we've got this. Help her.
monkey!
go!
what was I thinking?!
Mantis!
now!
Shifu taught you well.
but he didn't teach you everything.
you have done well, panda.
done well? Done well?
I've done awesome!
the mark of a true hero is humility.
but, yes, you have done...
...awesome
guys? Guys?! They're dead!
no, they're breathing. They're asleep? But their eyes are open.
we were no match for his nerve attach.
he's gotten stronger.
who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
he's too fast!
sorry, Po.
I thought we could stop him.
he could have killed you.
why didn't he?
so you could come back and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work.
it might. I mean, a little.
I'm pretty scared.
you can defeat him, panda!
are you kidding? If they can't?!
they're five masters. I'm just one me.
but you will have the one thing that no one else does.
you really believe I'm ready?
you are...
...Po.
behold the Dragon Scroll.
it is yours.
wait. What happens when I read it?
legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat.
Really? That's cool.
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.
you will feel the universe in motion around you.
can I punch through walls?
do a quadruple back flip? - Focus.
will I? - Focus.
focus. - Oh, yeah, yeah.
read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.
read it and become...
...the Dragon Warrior.
it's impossible to open.
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.
thank you.
I probably loosened it up for you though.
OK, here goes.
it's blank. - What?!
here, look. - No, I am forbidden to look upon...
blank. I don't...
I don't understand.
OK. So, like...
...Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all.
no. Oogway was wiser than us all.
Oh, come on! Face it, he picked me by accident.
of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
but who will stop Tai Lung?
he'll destroy everything and everyone.
no.
evacuate the valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.
what about you, Master? - I will fight him.
what? - I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.
but, Shifu, he'll kill you.
then I will finally have paid for my mistake.
listen to me, all of you.
it is time for you to continue yourjourney without me.
I am very proud to have been your master.
we've got to get them out safely.
come, little one. Let's find your mama.
viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north.
crane, light the way.
look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
Hey, Dad.
Po!
good to have you back, son.
good to be back.
let's go, Po.
so for our next shop, it's time to face it...
...the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables...
...no longer slices.
also, I was thinking, maybe this time we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in.
you like that?
Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.
it just wasn't meant to be.
Po, forget everything else.
your destiny still awaits.
we are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins.
I don't know, Dad.
honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.
Po...
...I think it's time I told you something I should have told you...
...a long time ago.
OK.
the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
come here. The secret ingredient is...
...nothing.
you heard me. Nothing!
there is no secret ingredient!
wait, wait. It's just plain old noodle soup?
you don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
don't have to. To make something special, you just believe it's special.
there is no secret ingredient.
I have come home, Master.
this is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master.
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.
so where is this Po?
did I scare him off?
this battle is between you and me.
so, that is how it's going to be.
that is how it must be.
I rotted in jail for 20 years because of your weakness!
obeying your master is not weakness!
you knew I was the Dragon Warrior.
you always knew.
but when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do?
what did you do?!
nothing!
you were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault!
not your fault?!
who filled my head with dreams?!
who drove me to train until my bones cracked?!
who denied me my destiny?!
it was never my decision to make!
it is now.
give me the scroll!
I would rather die.
all I ever did, I did to make you proud!
tell me how proud you are, Shifu!
tell me!
tell me!
I have... I have always been proud of you.
from the first moment, I've been...
...proud of you.
and it was my pride...
...that blinded me.
I loved you too much to see what you were becoming...
...what I...
...was turning you into.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I don't want your apology.
I want my scroll!
What?!
where is it?!
dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now.
you will never see that scroll, Tai Lung.
never.
never.
stairs.
who are you?
buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
you?
him? He's a panda.
you're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?
don't tempt me.
no. I'm gonna use this.
you want it? Come and get it.
Finally!
that scroll is mine!
lightning!
the scroll has given him power!
No!
Finally! Oh, yes.
the power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!
it's nothing!
it's OK. I didn't get it the first time, either.
what?
there is no secret ingredient.
it's just you.
stop it!
I'm gonna pee.
don't.
don't! Don't!
you...
...can't defeat me.
you...
...you're just a big...
...fat...
...panda!
I'm not a big fat panda.
I'm the big fat panda.
the Wuxi Finger Hold!
Oh, you know this hold?
you're bluffing. You're bluffing. Shifu didn't teach you that.
Nope.
I figured it out. Skadoosh.
look!
the Dragon Warrior.
that's my boy! That big lovely kung fu warrior is my son!
Yes!
Thanks, Dad.
Hey, guys.
master.
master.
master?
master Shifu!
master!
Shifu, are you OK?!
Po.
you're alive.
or we're both dead.
no, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung.
you did?
it is as Oogway foretold.
you are the Dragon Warrior.
you have brought peace...
...to this valley...
...and...
...and to me.
thank you.
thank you, Po.
thank you. Thank you.
No! Master! No, no, no, don't die, Shifu, please!
I'm not dying, you idiot!
dragon Warrior...
...I am simply at peace. Finally.
so, I should stop talking?
if you can.
want to get something to eat?
Yeah.

the END -=THE LAST FANTASY=
Oh, yeah, nice to see you.
that dress needs dry-cleaning.
here you go. Thank you kindly, Monica.
Monica, Monica? Oh shit, Hillary!
okay...
Hi, Bill. Oh hey Snow white.
Where's 11B?
Bingo!
what did you say that thing was?
it's time for a little action.
Monica... It's Bill.
I've got some dictation for you, Monica.
I've got a big secret for you, Baby.
how did you get up here so soon?
Monica.
Oh my eyes! I can't see!
who let you in!?
what happened... Where's Monica? What happened to Monica?
how did you get in here? She told me where the key was.
I can't see. Did she say it was ok to dry-hump her roommate?
she said, you would be in the library cause you were a geek...
I am not a geek! God!
my God. What was that, mace?
eternity, by Calvin Klein.
I gotta be so careful who I get into bed with from now on.
it would be a big adjustment for you, wouldn't it?
God!
I do that every time.
I've invented a solution for that. Seriously.
it is something that goes around the coffee cup, so you don't burn your hand.
I'm gonna call it "The Coffee Collar." Brilliant idea.
I know all about you. I know you whole wrap.
you do? Yeah. You're a senior...
who prays on freshmen. You've slept with half my floor.
well, half your floor was female.Whatever.
and you once met Bono, which I suspect is total bullshit.
no, it's true. He signed my CD.
it's upstairs in my room with my...
coffee Collar," if you wanna see it.
are you hitting on me? No. I'm going of your look.
my look... Yeah, doggy bull look.
are you calling me a dog? No, it's a theory I have.
Oh, Casanova has a theory.
Yeah. When a girl is attracted to a guy, she has a look.
it's her tell, like poker.
it's the same look a dog gets, right before you put down the bowl.
you're offensive. And you're crazy.
no, I'm honest.
I believe honesty is the best policy.
Alright...You want me to be honest with you?
sure. I'm majoring in fine art.
right. I'm studying the golden proportions of the human face. And you're nose is bent and and it drips down at the bottom.
a feature that is accentuated by the thinness of your upper lip. And your eyes, are too far apart, but they have to be to accommodate that bent nose. And I feel sorry for you, that you have to validate yourself through insatiable-meaningless-ego-sport-sex, with insecure girls like my roommate.
I... Would never have sex with someone... Like you.
hey come here!
that was amazing.
what was? The honesty.
that was better than sex without the... The crying.
actually it did feel pretty good. Yeah, no one's ever been that honest with me before. It's called a friend.
I'm Tom, by the way.
Hannah. Hannah? That's a palindrome.
well, good night.
good night.
your hands, Clammy... Well, I can see that you're knocked out.
Tom, is that you? Can I see your Bono-autograph?
she's all yours, friend.
Monica, get some sleep.
what time is it?
I'm late.
what are you doing tonight?
I don't do "back to backs."
isn't that what we were doing last night?
no, that was something different.
"back to Backs" is seeing each other two nights in a row
you know I don't do that.
couldn't you just break one of your stupid rules? No.
for me. I'm sorry, but I don't break the rules.
I have a rule about that.
see you next week.
Thanks.
excuse me. Sorry.
can I get a grandee drip, and a decaff, triple grandee, non-fat, extra hot, stirred milk Como Macchiato.
with whip cream, extra caramel.
fill that 70% of the way. Thank you.
here, let me put a "Coffee-Collar" on that.
thank you. I hear that the guy that invented that gets a dime for each one used. You're kidding.
I am not. That could add up.
I think I picked up yours by accident. Sorry about that.
that's alright. Thank you. Any time.
Bye-bye.
Gloria.
morning.
good morning, Hannah.
coffee, the way you like it.
perfect timing. I just finished working on his balls.
that's eh... Yeah! So I made a reservation.
so what rule is this? No "back to backs."
isn't that the same as the "no more than once a week"-rule?
no, the "no more than once a week"-rule works Monday to Fridays.
so theoretically you could have a Sunday night and Monday without breaking it.
exactly, you got it.
here we go. Hey, good morning.
can I get the steamed buns the scalloped steamed ducklings and the vegetarian and shrimp steamed...
thank you. For what?
you know how much I love the fried stuff. You look after me.
excellent. So, what did you say?
she was hurt, but you know...
but you were honest, right?
what? I was. I am. Always!
I know you are, but it's just shocking to see how you use it as a shield.
maybe I should lie. Be more like Dennis Philips, and say whatever it takes to get a woman into bed
no, do not be like Dennis Philips.
he's so gross. He only hit on you once.
at my father's funeral!
okay, so he's not known for his sensitivity.
Oh, God. Anyways...
what? Nothing.
I know that "nothing." It's not nothing, it's something.
Anyway..."? Anyway we both know, you don't need to lie to get a woman into bed.
Gloria.
I don't wanna lose that. Can I keep that? Thank you.
see there's another rule too. The 24 hour-rule.
I can't call her for another 24 hours.
cause then it appears that I'm too desperate.
you know, Dan sent me another letter?
asking you to move to Canada and marry him again?
a slice of apple-crumb pie?
no, we did that last time.
you guys broke up like a year ago. 19 months.
you're counting? No! He is... It was in the letter.
lemon butter cream cup?
not feeling the cream cup today.
cranberry orange muffin? Hannah, come on. You're losing it.
I know, I know... Okay. Think about it.
come on. You're disappointing. I got it, I got it...
Yeah! Wait, I so have it...
cream cheese sorrel brownie.
you're so good!
what do you think of this? I think we should get this.
Tom, I am not going to another one of your fathers weddings.
thank you. Hannah? Please?
take one of the girls you've been rubbing up against.
no weddings or family events.
that's right. I forgot that rule.
it gives the wrong impression. It does.
is this made with real alligator? Yes, baby-alligator.
you should be ashamed of yourself. Look at you.
hello there...And who would you be?
I love you. Yes I do. I love you.
you're so pretty. Yes you are. You're beautiful. Yes you are. Your beautiful face...
I love you, love you, love you.
you should try saying that to a human sometime.
what? A human?
to say it to a human?
you're sweet. Love you.
Hannah, please. Come to the wedding.
he gets married and I go.
I go because he's my father and I care deeply for the man.
and everybody knows he doesn't love them, and they don't love him.
it's pathetic, it breaks my heart. I don't know what to say.
you know when someone's making a mistake and it's not your place to interfere,
you simply say: "I'm happy you're happy."
I'm happy you're happy. Yeah.
okay. I'll do that.
I promise you, this is the last time I'll ask you to come.
and then I'll find somebody else to come to the next funeral.
Hannah, please.
that's cute.
last time. Thank you. Thank you.
she gets the apartment in the city, and 30 grand a month.
right. Right, okay.
you get the house in the Hamptons, she's asking for the apartment in the city, and 30 grand a month. Thirty? But...
are you still negotiating a pre-nup?
now the party starts... My son is here!
dad, you're getting married in 10 minutes.
dad, please, I can't breathe.
did you bring the lovely Hannah? Yes, I did.
you know, if you don't act on that pretty soon, you know what I'm gonna do?
no. I'm gonna make her my number 6!
seven... This is number 6.
Yeah. My God, you are pretty.
dad!
I used to be that pretty once. Dennis, look how pretty my boy is.
Yeah, he's beautiful. They won't accept a minimum of 5 times a week.
she promised 5, I want 5.
what did she promise you, 5 times a week?
4 times? Two!
no, no... We're not done yet.
she says 3, with a bi-monthly BJ. This is disturbing.
4 and make it weekly.
wait, no... Driver go around the block. We are not even close...
what was that?
come on. Come on, tell me.
say what you gotta say
I'm happy, If you're happy.
no, no... "You're too old for her dad."
she doesn't love you, this is embarrassing."
you're gonna rack up your fifth divorce.
sixth. Sixth.
I'm happy, if you're happy. Bullshit!
go for 4 if you exercise more.
she says you can't gain any more weight.
take it. Deal! Deal.
I told her I weigh 10 pounds more than I do.
ain't love grand? Sign the both please.
what's he signing now?
his current pre-nup and his last divorce-papers.
that's just great...
your good. Thank you.
Cheers. Cheers.
did you tell your dad you love him? I told him I cared for him.
you can't even tell your father.
I don't get that. It's a "Guy thing."
no, it's a "Tom thing."
you're an "I love you-slut." Are you kidding me?
you say it all the time. To everybody.
Oh, this looks so good. Yeah, it looks good doesn't it?
I should have ordered this.
this look good. You always order better than I do.
it's lemon, right? It's good. I'm ordering that from now on.
no, you won't. Why?
I need you to order the chocolate cake so I can have some.
there's my"son"! There you go...
Oh, you're bad boy. I'm gonna spank you.
you know what I would like to say to you? Is that...
I want you to listen to me, Tom. Yeah.
if you need any advice...
or you need any advice... Right.
or you got girl problems, I don't know...
I need you to think of me how you would a real mother.
yeah that's exactly what I... Look at this beauty, will you?
Hello, Sweety
drunk as the night I first met her.
you are a bad influence on her. Me?
last shot? Thanks.
I'm stealing you away... Last one...
he does know that he can just date, right?
no, I don't think he does.
to mothers. To mothers. Cheers.
careful.
nice...
Oh God...
hide me!
what? It's my dad's patient coordinator.
Yeah, don't look, don't look... There... Don't look!
she's obsessed with me.
she's created a website called "allthingstom. org."
a Psycho blogger? Yes.
okay. Come on... Dance with me.
watch yourself. She's kind of cute.
Oh stop it. I'm serious...
keep going.
here. Right here. Hide me. back side, side. Go, go...
the last blog was a 2 page description of my face.
see, she doesn't think my nose is too bent or my lips are too thin.
who said that? You did. When we met.
well, I lied. What?
I thought you were hot. Really?
well, you told me I looked like a dog.
that was just cause I was trying to sleep with you.
why haven't you since?
well... I like having you in my life.
Hi, Tom!
Oh, hi! Did you see the new blog?
no, we haven't.
who's this? This? This is my girlfriend.
why didn't you tell me you're seeing someone?
because I don't know you.
but we have a really, really open relationship...
Really? You know? I wanted to talk to you about that, princess. Princess?
I... I don't wanna be with anybody but you.
I don't know if I really quite ready to make that commitment...
are you? You know my rules...
I'm bit of an emotional retard. Yeah...
I think I need to start a new blog now.
that is so scary. She's psychotic on top of P.
Oh, this is not good.
you out of my way! Hey!
okay, good... She's gone. Perfect. Let's go.
good, come on. What?
do you remember that ancestral home in Scotland, with those amazing paintings I told you about?
it's all I think about. Stop it, Tom.
I finally got the board to sign of on making editions to a permanent collection.
Really?
but they want me to go to Scotland for an acquisitionship.
when are you going? A couple of days.
couple of days? For how long? Six weeks.
that's a long time.
that's great. You think?
Yes, it's a great opportunity for you.
you're like the "museum maiden of the Met."
it's got a good ring to it...
thank you. Congratulations.
six Sundays.
that is six Sundays. What am I gonna do without you?
I can just imagine.
Yeah...What are you doing?
I'm gonna jump! No, no.
I'm gonna jump. Jesus!
six Sundays, how can I live without you?
can you not take anything seriously?
Yeah, I can. Get down.
let's get you another drink. I think I've had too many already.
thanks for coming to the wedding. It was a ball,
I can't wait for number seven. It's coming up soon, I have a feeling.
we also ask at this time that you turn off all your electronic devices.
please leave your cell phones turned off for the duration of the flight.
I'm not gonna be able to play today, man.
if we don't have a fourth, we are gonna end up playing with "Tiny-Shorts Guy."
so? Hey, how's it going?
need another? No, our friend Paul, with longer shorts, is coming. Right.
no, Jenny signed him up for some art walk thing...
art walk? Are you serious? Tell me something,
what do you think Jenny did with his balls when she cut them off?
come on, guys, marriage isn't that bad.
I agree. Without marriage there would be no divorce, and without divorce I wouldn't have my condo in Aspen.
bingo.
good one. What is he?
I'm serious, man. Your missing out on the best parts of life.
the most important part of life. This coming from the guy who's wife won't let him own porn. He's gotta wank off to the underwear section of the Sears catalogue.
I thought we weren't gonna talk about that?
what's the matter with you? You are single and you've been single, ever since...What was her name?
sophomore year. Plim... Pimpkin, Pimpkin, that's it.
Pimpkin dumped you for him.
sophomore year, you've never been the same you haven't been able to sleep.
Scarred...Yeah. You have no idea, how nice it is to have someone who is gonna be there, no matter what, whatever.
snaps to that. And you don't know how nice it is to sleep with a different girl every night.
that's true. Nice recital.
you got the best of both worlds, Tom.
no, it's true. I can sleep with whoever I want,
but I still get to hang out with Hannah afterwards.
perfect setup.
Yeah, well maybe not for Hannah...
what's that supposed to mean? Come on, Tom. She's a woman.
Yeah, I got that.
you sure? Yeah.
Tom, she's pushing 30. You think her idea of "Happily ever after" is coming home to you and hanging out after you got laid?
makes you think, right? Yeah.
Hallo? Hey.
Hi. How's the weather in England?
it's great. Only I'm in Scotland.
right, right. So it's sunny?
it's 3 in the morning. Oh, right. Sorry.
so it's dark. Yeah.
have you seen the Loch Ness Monster?
I know, terrible joke...
was there something important?
Yeah. You'll never guess what happened.
what? They filled in the pot hole.
the pot hole? On 83rd.
terrific... Hey, Tom? Yeah?
I'm gonna go back to sleep now. Ok. Sure.
love you.
good night... Call me tomorrow.
this stuff's all old... Yeah, that's the point.
let's go to Fendi... Fendi? No.
we're here, let's just stay here.
I'm not into old stuff.
why do you talk like a six-year-old?
I'm not.
the line is too long...
can't we just go somewhere else? No.
this is the best bakery in the world. That's why it's worth waiting in line.
come on. We'll play a game.
wanna play a game? Yeah, I can play a game.
okay. Good.
tell me what to order. Why?
you'll see. It will be fun. Make a suggestion.
a cookie. No, you have to be specific, like what type of cookie...
a really big cookie.
Tom, your phone's ringing...
hallo. Hallo?
Hallo...
what's wrong? Just an important call.
that's because you are an important person.
wait! Hey...
we will have...
2 fried dumplings, 2 of the wantons and 6 of the fried "pork-thingies."
Yeah. But that's fried. It's not healthy.
Oh, come on. Have some of the fried...
it won't hurt you.
thank you.
move, please!
God.
this is unbelievable.
Hallo? Hey, hallo?
Hello? Hannah?
Hello? Hey.
Tom? Tom is that you?
Tom? Hallo?
Hallo? You're cutting out, I can't hear anything you're saying.
Tom? I'm stuck in a thunderstorm.
I'm surrounded by a world of cows.
I'll call you when I get to the hotel... I can't hear you.
Tom?
hallo.
Hallo! Hallo?
Hallo?
I hate Scotland.
having a hard time? We're having a hard time...
Oh yeah? Want a hand? Thank you, sir.
Yeah. We would love it.
you'd better sit down, sir.
sit down. Sit, sit, sit.
here we go.
thank you. No, no, thank you.
thank you. Have a good afternoon.
you were wonderful.
come on, Scott. Let's go.
what you got, Gar? What you got, Gar? What do you got?
come on. What do you got, Gary?
foul! Foul, Tom! What the matter with you today?
ahh... I think I might have feelings for Hannah.
come on, come on... Let's just play.
it's just...
without her, something's off, and it's got me thinking that maybe there's more to life than just sleeping around.
I don't understand... I'm not following...
come on, let's just play. Come on.
I'll take it out.
I know exactly what you mean, Tom.
Thanks. Here you go.
I'm gonna tell Hannah. When she gets home,
I'm gonna tell her that i wanna be with her, not marriage, just be together.
Yeah, that's romantic...
>You have one unheard message <
Hey, Tom. I'm back. God, I cannot wait to see you.
I don't care what you're doing tonight, cancel it.
we're going to dinner.
meet me at that new trendy place, next to the small Greek place we hated that used to be the Thai-fusion place we loved.
meet me there 8 o'clock, I have so much to tell you.
Hey, what have you got? Hey Buddy. I'll find you something.
alright...
here's something. How many do you want?
I'll take the yellow ones. Good choice. Ten bucks.
here you go. Thanks.
have a good night. I will.
sorry, is she already here? Over there.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh, God!
Tom, are you okay? I'm alright. Are you alright?
I think I have a broken rib.
your flowers, sir. They're not mine! I'm fine, I'm okay!
I'm okay. Are you okay?
I'm so sorry. You alright?
here are your flowers. What, what...
you had flowers? They're not my flowers.
they're your flowers. I didn't have flowers.
Hi! It's so good to see you! I've missed you.
great. Come here, there's someone I want you to meet.
Oh good.
it started pouring and suddenly it was just me in a field of cows.
and, of course we're in Europe so there's no street signs anywhere and it's getting dark... And then she thought she was in some bad werewolf movie.
stay off the moors, Lassie.
anyway... all of the sudden, out of nowhere, Colin comes riding up on horseback.
can you believe it? A horse. Oh...
he asked me if I needed any help.
you were a "Lady in distress," what was I supposed to do?
it was right out of a Bronte-novel.
so anyway... He shows me to this charming little Inn, where he proceeds to buy me the most awful dinner I've ever had.
it was pretty bad, even by Scottish standards.
then we just spend the next month travelling around the country, getting to know each other, visiting museums... It was.
perfect! Perfect!
so... When it was time for Hannah to leave, I just...
I don't know, I just... Couldn't let her go.
so I got down on one knee.
and he proposed. And I accepted!
Wow! That's just... Huge, it's...
so the wedding's coming together very quickly.
sounds like it. We're gonna be married in Scotland,
at Colin's parents summer home.
it's gonna be a pretty small thing.
we can't expect too many people making the trip over sea, just for a forth night.
the Fourth? Right.
that's two weeks! It's crazy, isn't it?
have you ever been to Scotland, Tom? You know, I haven't.
you should see the wee church we're gonna have
it's the same one Colin's parent's were married in.
it's pretty spectacular, just a walk from my distillery.
distillery? Colin's family owns the largest whiskey distillery in Scotland.
Tom. Look, If you're getting married
I expect to be your "Best Man."
Tom... Will you be my "Maid of Honor"?
your "Maid of Honor"?
sorry.
what is it with you, man? I didn't...
excuse me... Excuse me! Did you see that?
"made of Honor"?
that's fun stuff! But you're a guy!
go ahead... Just get it out.
so, what did you say?
did you say yes? No!
no? I didn't know what to say.
I told her I'd think about it.
you need to think about whether your dress is gonna make your ass look big!
give me a break, come on! Okay. Alright, let me think.
is she really in to this guy?
you should have seen them.
staring at him all moony like he shits unicorns.
that's not good, man. I'm thinking you're gonna have to do this.
you're gonna have to be the Maid of Honor.
what? Yeah, I'm serious. Think about it, this will give you an excuse to be around Hannah all the time.
helping her out, being "the man behind the curtain..."
you'll be her confident.
and you can use that time to point out to Hannah that this is really crazy.
and that she doesn't even know this guy at all!
no, I'm not gonna do that. No way.
what? No.
look, I don't know what your other options are.
you got a better chance of stopping this wedding, from "inside"than from another continent.
and they say that you can shorten this and wear it again, if you like.
come on man. If you're serious and you really want Hanna back from this guy,
you're gonna have to do whatever it takes.
whatever.
the dress is beautiful. Thank you!
I am so happy you're gonna do this! My pleasure.
for this wedding, I am willing to do whatever it takes.
I'm so excited! Yeah, me too!
so let me tell you who the other bridesmaids are gonna be.
okay! Okay. Stephanie...
Stephanie, great. And she loves you!
good! And my friend Hillary, from camp.
Hillary, I don't know Hillary.
she's the best. Okay.
and Melissa. Oh, no!
I had to, Tom, she's my cousin. No, she hates me!
well, you broke her heart.
she broke my nose.
it was an accident. She hit me with her fist!
I was completely honest with her. I said:
"look, nothing serious."
and she agreed.
so sometimes our hearts don't match our mouths.
that's good, you should put that in your vows.
and, she's been wanting to be my maid of honor since we were 5 years old, so now she's really gonna hate you.
here they are now.
okay. Well as your Maid of Honor,
I promise to keep the peace.
Oh, hi!
Yes! The bride to be!
Hello, you must be Tom. And you must be Hillary.
you look gorgeous.
Stephanie, how are you doing? So good to see you.
are you kidding! It's you, Melissa.
look at that...
this was great. This isn't awkward...
go on. I'm gonna be fine.
Tom, have you met Colin yet? Yes.
isn't he dreamy? Absolutely.
could someone please pass me the Splendor?
could someone who's not a misogynist, please pass the Splenda?
Hallo? Thank you, Stephanie.
it's Colin, you guys.
Hi, babe! Just a sec... Hi!
so cute!
we only have 9 days before we leave for Scotland, so we have to act quickly. Exactly.
I've been a "MOH" 6 times, so I'll organize everything that needs to be done, even though I'm not officially the "MOH" here.
what is a "MOH"? M-O-H.
maid Of Honor.
Yes! Oh, yes. That's clever.
no, it's going great. Very smoothly.
so we got the bridal shower bachelorette, dress fittings,
the "kilt..." I'll do the "kilt."
okay... perfect. Okay.
shopping for Hannah's true self...
that's gonna be great. So, what is Hannah's true self?
it's lingerie. For her wedding night.
how do you expect to be a good "MOH" if you don't even know that.
she's talking to me. No, I didn't!
you just did. Oh, I'm sorry, Tom.
did I break a rule?
how about we focus on the wedding part?
good idea. Just for now...
okay, I need, dress sizes.
I'm a four. Okay.
eight. Sorry?
you know, Hillary... Do you think that maybe you'd just be more comfortable in like a, twelve? No, it will be fine.
I'm doing the Dr. Riverbed fast. Oh, yeah!
Yeah. What is that?
water, peach raisin/apple pectin /shark extract,
and Lowry's Seasoning Salt.
what about food? Look,
I'm going to look amazing in that dress,
I am going to meet a Scottish man, and...
I'm gonna be happy! Write down an eight!
got it.
what's your dress size, Made Of Honor?
I don't know. What's your jock size, Melissa?
that's enough! Enough!
sorry. But will you guys look at Hannah, please.
she's happy, finally.
so please, for Hannah, let's all just get along, put a smile on our faces and pretend everything's perfect!
here she comes. Okay. Fine.
what did he say? He's so sweet!
isn't that great?
how's it going?
good, really good. Fantastic.
and it's pretty much done. Perfect, really?
Tom. Yes?
here. What is this?
she does bridal shower entertainment.
and I hired her for Stephanie's sisters shower, and Hannah loved it. She reads Tarot cards and stuff.
that's great. Thank you, Melissa.
I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it for Hannah.
okay. Thank you, for Hannah.
it should have been me...
I'll talk with you tomorrow. Okay.
Bye, Tom. Goodbye.
Bye, Hillary. Nice meeting you.
you too, bye.
I just had a very nice bonding moment with Melissa.
can I ask you a favor? Sure.
my mother and grandmother are coming in to town tomorrow,
and I have so much to plan...
I was wondering if you and the boys could entertain Colin for the day.
entertain him? Yeah, just kind of get to know him and stuff.
sure. Cool.
so are you more proud of "Scotch Tape" or McDonald's?
I think they're both American.
so wait, you invited this guy to play ball with us?
Yeah, he's the competition.
I need to get to know his strengths and weaknesses.
I like his green shirts. Is that like a poly blend kind of thing?
Yeah, it's my shirt
it's your shirt? Yeah.
looks good on him, huh? Yeah, real good.
why don't you play with him?
Thanks.
Colin, have you ever played basketball before?
we would call this "netball," back in Scotland, it's more of a woman's game, so, no I don't have much experience.
Hi, I do. Need one more? We're good.
alright.
alright, "girls," you ready?
Yeah, I am.
Oh. Use your hands.
you alright there? Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm open. I'm open. Here we go.
you gotta hold on to the ball, man! Hold on to the ball.
Homos! Homos! Homos.
let's get the Scottish girl out if the tree.
you wanna start a game cause you didn't get that.
there you go. Open. Open.
here you go. That was good. Good.
good. Amiga.
shoot it. Guys.
I like it! I'm sorry.
come on! Get on the path.
you ok?
OK, basket. Put it in the basket! Put it in the basket!
you know what I'm learning? The guy's a chump.
Yeah.
wow, "Fault." There it is. That's it.
that's it! That's it! We got it now.
Hey, I look good now, don't I?
here we go.
put it in the basket!
in the basket! Take a shot, chief!
sorry, guys. Did you see that?
probably not allowed to just stuff it in like that.
he dunks the ball. Sorry. Sorry.
he dunks the ball...
that was awesome! You can dunk! He can dunk! That is awesome.
if that's allowed, why don't you guys all do it?
if we could, we would. Right?
play? Guys.
no. Yeah!
score! Yeah.
Yes! Good game, yeah, good game.
my brother!
looks like you're getting more competition.
I know, I know...
I love this guy!
shit.
you alright? Yeah.
what happening?
my boy's got mad cow disease.
we have got to get some dirt on this guy.
I got a guy I use when a spouse suspect infidelity.
everybody's got skeletons in the closet.
nobody is squeaky-clean, and my guy's the best.
I don't know, it just seems so cheap.
don't worry, I'll charge you double because you're rich.
I mean, it's a cheap thing to do.
he play's cheap, you gotta match that.
how does Colin play cheep?
that whole thing with Hannah, being Scottish.
making her fall in love with him in Scotland.
that "monster thing" of his.
fine. Get the dirt.
that's cool.
van Wyck Expressway Kennedy Airport 1. 5 mile
what's he gonna do, eat her?
come on, come on. Take a breath. Take a...
Thanks, Tom.
Yeah, have a great flight. Right. Thanks, mate.
come on...
I love you, Colin. Bye.
Bye.
yeah... My God.
need some chap stick? Yeah...
so... What church should we go to?
Grace's Church.
thank you so much for coming with me to meet the reverend.
no problem. He is the sweetest man...
yeah? Yeah.
he married my parents and insisted on coming to Scotland to do my wedding.
why didn't Colin stay and do this with you?
it was more important for him to go back to Scotland to partition
the Grand Council so Colin and I could get married.
I don't know. Grand? What does that mean?
I'm not Scottish and his family is kind of...
what?
royalty.
royalty?
royalty? Is he like a King? No! No, he's a Duke.
a Duke?
Hannah, darling. Reverend Foote.
and this must be the lucky young man who is marrying our beautiful Hannah.
Oh, no.
I'm not marrying him.No...
this is Tom, my "Maid Of Honor."
maid of Honor? Yes.
how about that...
we have many gay and lesbian members of the congregation.
welcome.
thank you. Thank you, Reverend.
so...
let's talk about the wedding. Okay.
I need to get some details about you and...
Colin. Colin, yes.
I want to work it in to the ceremony.
okay. It was such a whirl wind. Really...
Yes, enlighten me. Tell me about it.
Hannah, darling.
Hannah, I think it's important to dig deep here for the vows and tell the Reverend all you know about Colin.
all that you love about him. Okay.
and not just the obvious stuff, but those unique characteristics that are Colin.
those things that make you laugh and say...
that's so "Colin."
right...
and then, maybe you could get some information from Colin...
and emphasize their unique bond, their shared history.
off course.
we could talk about love at first sight.
well, that's always a crowd pleaser, but...
Hannah... Elaborate...
tell me more about him. How you feel about him.
where did you meet?
in Scotland... Modigliani!
your first summer in New York City you were dating a guy who worked on Wall Street...
and he asked you to move in with him and you weren't quite sure...
and it was right around that time that you "discovered" Modigliani...
and became obsessed with this painting...
of this woman who had this blue scarf on, holding a baby.
and Hannah said: "That painting captured the essence of that woman better than any photograph."
I can't believe you can remember that.
I also remembered that she freaked, because she said she felt more passionate about that painting than she did about "Mr. Wall Street..."
and she wondered if she could ver meet somebody that could make her feel this assionate as that work of art.
that's good.
that's good.
now I know why you picked him to be "Maid of Honor."
yes...
come on! Who's ready to lose some money tonight!
because I'm feeling lucky!
you guys are late. How you doing?
how you holding up, champ? Stressed.
what the hell is this?
Hannah's shower's in the morning
well where are we gonna play?
we're not gonna play until these baskets get done, and everything else gets done.
what about this party mix? That's "pot-pourri."
this is perfect...
come on Felix, take that off.
have you ever had one of these?
that's funny... You can't even see.
you'll have to, to sleep with you...
take this. You could be like blinded.
no, I'm not playing with baskets. It's poker night.
you put "Bayberry" with "Serenity."
you don't like? No, it's interesting.
just thought it was obvious that "Bayberry" worked best with "Harmony."
Really? I've been putting "Bayberry" with "Tahitian Sunrise."
that I like. That's Zen. Yeah.
you know what I like? I like how you put the bat ball right in the center.
I like that so much that I'm gonna see you ball and raise you another ball.
that's a good idea. We should definitely have 2 balls...
Yeah. Do another ball. Hey, Dennis...
come and curl some ribbon.
I can feel my sperm dying inside of me, one at a time.
shut up and grab a basket. Come on, it's fun.
I'm going to a strip club to eat some meat.
then I'm gonna get into a fight.
call me when you find your balls, Tom.
alright, tuff guy.
or maybe they're in the basket, next to the "Tahitian Sunrise."
someone's afraid of his feminine side...
look at that... Nice job with the fluffing.
look at that.
perfect. Perfect. What is that, my friends.
look at us. Come on.
can't lose. Good work, huh?
hello ladies. You look lovely today.
Tom! Oh, Hillary. How are you?
good. Everything looks wonderful.
this is the best shower I've ever been to.
Really? You think so?
you know what, Hillary? You should really eat something.
no, Tom. I'm fine.
fine. I'm okay.
what you ladies would go through to fit in to a dress...
this pretty much blows your rule out of the water about no women allowed at your place.
what good is a rule if you don't break it every now and then?
I'm very, very impressed. Thank you.
listen to that.
gay Gordon's party remix, just for you.
hear the horn.
it's good isn't it? No.
let me turn it up there... It's...
it's a little loud... What?
it's a little loud! Okay. There you go.
look at this. Try this. Haggis pink.
it's pepper, cheese, chopped up baby lamb lung, and cow pituitary gland.
how are you?
it's a Scottish delicacy. Colin recommended it.
ladies, ladies. Look...
what just came, for Hannah.
it's from Colin, everyone.
Oh wait. There's a card. There's a card, a card...
for: "Hannah."
Hannah, my love, this is the extremely rare Scottish floral bud thistle."
this?
they only bloom for 4 hours before they die.
he must have timed this out perfectly...
Oh my gosh, when we first met,
Colin promised that he would roam at the countryside to find me one, and he did.
sweetheart, that's the most romantic thing I ever heard.
thanks mom.
Joan, good to see you. It's been too long.
Easter, wasn't it?
Yes. You slept with our maid.
she told you? I didn't know she spoke English.
yes...
this is grandma Pearl. You remember Tom?
how are you? Oh, yes, the fornicator.
that's right.
okay... Tom, this is awesome.
it's great. Good. Thank you.
this is even better than my sister's shower.
Oh, really? Ahem...
everything seems to be doing well. Yes?
Sharon would like to know where to set up.
who? The entertainment...
Ah, yes... I mean good. She should set up over there.
hello everybody. Hi, I'm Sharon. Good to see you all.
Yeah, come on, right down the front.
this was my idea, you know?
I know how much you loved her from Stephanie's sister's shower...
before we start, I would like for us all to take in a deep breath...
she wasn't at the shower...
she wasn't? No.
and now exhale slowly... Really?
good job.
it's very important to reset our third eye.
and connect to the primal inside of ourselves,
before I present the pleasure aids.
pleasure aids?
now...
these pleasures are best used when in tantric meditative state.
and today, I'm going to show you ladies how to reach your optimal sacred Chakra.
all of these aids are for sale, ladies.
and look what we have here... Edible panties.
you look hungry. Try to snack on these.
there you go.
now ladies, what pleasure party would be complete without...
glow-in-the-dark thunder beads?
these are terrific. And for you ladies, today...
two for one.
okay?
there you go. Wanna try this out, princess?
where do these go?
from casual writing to evening wear. Gorgeous!
why don't you keep those?
and they match your ear rings.
Hannah, are you okay?
you know that I've dreamt of my wedding shower, ever since I was 10 years old?
no...
strangely enough, the image of my grand mom, pearl drape and glow-in-the-dark thunder beads wasn't part of it.
it's not funny, Tom.
do you have any idea how important this is to me?
the Gay Gordon, pink Haggis, Dildo-sales woman?
just understand something, Melissa set me up.
Oh please! There's always an excuse with you.
I never even should have asked you to do this in the first place.
you don't even believe in marriage for Christ sake...
you know, I might.
I gotta get back.
Melissa's pretty good.
look, the whole goal here was to convince Hannah that I've grown up, and that she doesn't know anything about Colin...
that I'm the right man for her.
that did not happen.
Stella. No, baby. don't eat buttons, okay?
Yeah, but your still the Maid of Honor, right Tom?
I don't know. I think she might have fired me.
how does somebody get fired from being Maid of Honor?
tell me about it.
you know what? I got an idea. Okay.
to prove to Hannah that you're the only man for her, we have to make you the best Made of Honor, ever.
right.
I'm out of loss. Completely stunned. Great.
my guy couldn't find any dirt on Colin.
this has never happened. This guy's clean.
glad that happened to me.
you know, he's got 3 Guinness world records?
cool! We don't need to know that...
he's actually got a Medal of Honor.
that's funny, because we got the Made of Honor!
let's stay focused.
look, the point is, we're not gonna get her off this guy.
Yeah, so we need to make this not about Colin.
Yeah, we need to make it about you.
good... You gotta show her
that you're growing up... Finally...
I am changing. I am growing up.
good! Then this should be easy for you. Great...
these are bridal magazines from 18 different countries...
each with a feature article on the duties of being the Maid of Honor.
perfect! "er Bride..."
I got these guys in Bangalore that we're outsource to, they translated them over night.
great. Nice "appetizers" there, Gary...
here's the "Main course." What have you got for me?
my wife Deb is a A-type personality, she has to do everything perfect.
sure... Love her...
hate that about her. Right.
anyway, she rented this when she was gonna be the Maid Of Honor for her yoga teacher.
this is "the goods." You're gonna be wow-ed.
12 Steps Down The Aisle
Hi, I'm Elisabeth Hasselbeck and I'm just so thrilled you've purchased this program.
and I'm proud of you...
because it shows that you're not happy being just an ordinary friend and loved one.
no. You and I are gonna work together to make you the perfect Maid of Honor.
when we're through, you'll know everything there is to know about dresses,
crockery, nuptial etiquette and pleasing your bride.
what's the length... of the bridesmaid dress?
no longer than the brides.
what if you know someone won't be able to attend the wedding?
you got to send an invitation anyway.
receiving line?
receiving line?
if there's a receiving line, it means I've failed, because Hannah's married.
right. It was a trick question.
who was the runner up MVP in 1974?
no, these questions all have to do with Tom being the best Maid Of Honor he can be.
alright.
I thought we were just asking like... Questions.
go sit down.
basic duties of the Maid of Honor?
manage the bridesmaids, carry the ring, and support the bride.
basic duties as You as the Maid of Honor?
show Hannah that I've matured, that I can take care of my responsibilities fully...
and that I need to destroy the wedding from within.
what happens if you fail at that task? Colin gets her.
what are we gonna do? Steal the bride!
what are we gonna do? Steal the bride!
what are we gonna do? Steal the bride!
steal the bride!
and remember...
weather it is helping with the seating chart or giving your opinion on the cake, the perfect Maid Of Honor is with her bride every step of the way.
you didn't have to clear your whole day to do all this.
are you kidding? Of course I did.
the perfect Maid of Honor is with his bride every step of the way.
a changed man...
I am indeed.
I don't even know where to begin.
when choosing a china pattern, you need to think about what type of entertaining you're open to, foods you wanna cook...
look. Now don't be afraid to mix and mash.
it's important, even with different styles and textures.
what you wanna do, is stir up the table.
make it come alive with color and tenacity. That's the goal.
also, at the end of the day... You will find...
...Connections.
thank you very much.
let's go.
if you think I'm good with plates, wait till you see what I do with linens.
lingerie, perfect. What about the linens?
you'll be able to pick out something for the wedding night.
No! Are you crazy? You're the perfect person for this job.
who's taken off more lingerie than you?
let's put your "whore-ing" to good use.
good point.
so how did it go with the Scottish Grand Council?
great. Colin got them to approve everything.
great.
so, I gotta tell you... This is gonna sound funny, but...
I have to thank you. For what?
for asking me to be your Maid of Honor.
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but...
you've really opened my eyes, to the whole idea of marriage.
Yeah, right... No, seriously...
have you met someone, Tom? No.
then how can you be serious?
I don't know, I just...
I don't know.
what do you think?
think Colin will like it?
no... no.
what? It's just...
it's cute.
"cute"? I do not wanna look "cute" on my wedding night.
just put this on. Cover yourself up.
that's my coat.
thank you. Thank you. Yeah.
here let me get you in a cab. Come on.
I can't believe this is my last day in New York.
what are you talking about?
I've been meaning to tell you, Tom.
when I leave tomorrow, I'm not coming back.
I've decided to move to Scotland, to be with Colin.
you're leaving New York? I am.
it's exciting, you know? It makes sense.
he's next in line to take over the family business...
it's a whole new chapter.
you were amazing today, you know that? Oh, yeah?
Yeah. I had no idea you could juggle like that.
Yeah, well...
I mean, women yes, china no.
Yeah, I know. You're always amazing.
come here.
see you in Scotland soon, okay? Yeah, see you over there.
I'll miss you.
Scotland...
come, baby.
he likes you.
Hi. Hey.
nice dogs. This is Hamish and this is Callum.
Callum? Yeah.
what kind of dog is that?
he's a Scottie. A Scottie?
that's perfect. Fuckin Scottie...
I've never felt like this before.
so hopeless.
so, tell me again, why you agreed to be the Maid of Honor?
to be with her, make her happy.
figure out some way to get her off of him.
maybe that was all wrong. Maybe he's better for her than me.
he's Scottish, he can dunk, he's perfect.
nobody's perfect. But I tell you, this whiskey comes damn close...
it was a gift from Colin. He made it.
swell.
I can't go. I can't watch Hannah marry this guy.
she's moving to Scotland, I've lost her already.
crap. ..."Love something, set it free."
said by a pussy and used by pussies ever since.
Casablanca. "Bogie" put's her on a plane.
pussy.
bogie's a pussy? Big pussy.
you know, I've only truly been in love once.
most amazing woman in the world. She was my best friend.
but I was young, stupid, and I messed it up.
in my great list of mistakes, that was the greatest.
who was this? Your mother.
when I finally found out how stupid I was and I decided to fight for it...
I was too late.
she wouldn't take me back.
she was right.
and then it really was too late.
by the way... I'm getting another divorce.
dad...
hey... Go and get her, you pussy.
what about the dresses?
ups are delivering them tomorrow morning.
I gave you the tracking address... I got it.
so, Colin and Hannah are gonna meet everyone at the house...
okay. Great.
Thomas. Yeah?
go get 'em, Maid of Honor.
Yeah. Make this the perfect wedding.
and steal the bride. Thanks, guys. Thanks.
thanks for everything, man. Thank you so much, alright?
alright, baby. Alright. Alright, alright. Get out of here.
I'll see you later.
this is like a fairy tale. Hannah is SO lucky.
I know. I wish I was her.
how has she ever found such a great guy?
we'll come visit her.
I know... Look at the time.
what's your name?
you're a pretty dog. I love you.
that's his house? No, isn't this the summer house?
the McMurray's have homes for each season.
this summer home, is their smallest.
they also have an Autumn home, a Winter home, a Spring...
I know the seasons, thanks, buddy.
somebody's richer than you, Tom.
I guess you are gonna have to invent something even stupider.
Oh, my God!
the entire castle was actually build in 1220...
this is incredible, isn't it? Yes...Wow...
grandma Pearl, Joan, this is my mother,
Diedre and my father, Mungo.
how do you do? How do you do?
how do you do? Nice to meet you, Joan. Pleasure.
thank you. Nice to meet you.
everyone, I want you to meet someone who is so special to my Hannah and who has been her life-long friend, and now her Maid of Honor, Tom.
Hi, how is... Did he just say he's the Maid of Honor...
he's a bloke?!
how do you do? Very good, thank you.
Mungo. Mungo, pleasure. Thank you.
definitely gay.
and these are the bridesmaids. Hillary, Stephanie and Melissa.
how do you do? Hello.
Hi. Nice that you could come. How do you do?
how do you do?
so... what do you think?
I think, they think I'm gay.
look can we get together, talk, catch up?
Tom, do wanna see your chamber? Love to.
okay, follow me. Thank you.
thank you.
thank you!
now then... I think just a few more sprigs of jipsoffle at the front there...
lovely.
what do you guys think? Oh! It is gorgeous...
it is so pretty... With the veil... So shiny, and the volume...
Tom... What do you think?
of...? The hair! Yeah, it...
this sash will go on the dress.
Really? Tradition!
what's up with that?
well...
I'm not. entirely sure...
Oh no, you see... It's attached up here...
Tom, you're the Maid of Honor, it's good to just be supportive...
I'm supportive. I don't think you are.
no, I am. Listen to me...
you're doing good, you're good...
Hannah...
actually, your hair... Looks amazing.
Really? Yes.
the games will be starting soon. Here are your costumes.
games? Costumes!
our costumes? What do you mean, games?
the Highland games.
it's a tradition, in honor of the wedding.
it goes right back to the time when the groom had to prove that he was man enough to deserve the bride.
if he didn't win, he didn't get the bride.
no problem for my Colin...
welcome, one and all to the Highland Games.
men have travelled from all four corners of this great country to compete in feats of strength and agility.
but only one warrior will be man enough to claim the bride.
one warrior that needs no introduction is our very own Colin McMurray.
isn't Colin handsome? And coming up, here, all the way from America, Hannah's Maid of Honor, Tom.
who I think you can all agree is wearing a rather fetching mini-kilt.
who was in charge of that? I have no idea.
they're really giving their all.
and we're running neck and neck...
a Scottish man against a Yank.
ladies and gentlemen, the result of today's Highland Games rests upon the "Cable Toss."
the competition is down to 2 competitors.
a tree...We're tossing a tree?
what a toss!
way to go, Colin!
okay, Tom. Let's see what you're made of!
the whole competition rests on this throw.
look at that Yankee!
alright. Okay.
come on, Tom! Oh gosh...
okay. I can do this. I can do this. Okay.
here we go. Great.
okay. Okay.
here we go. Here we go.
here we go, Oh...
watch out, watch out.
that's gonna cost the Yank the gold medal.
what an ass! And the winner of the Highland Games is, our very own Colin McMurray!
that's great.
for my love is like a melody
that sweetly played in Tune
as fair art thou, my bonny lass say deep in love am I
and I will love thee still, my dear till all the seas gang dry
and I will love thee still, My dear
though t'were 10 thousand miles.
well done, My boy.
well done!
that was so...!
well done, my boy.
robert Burns, who wrote that song, is Scotland's most famous poet.
no, no, Auntie. We haven't had any "bairns" yet, so we haven't got any names yet.
Bairns" means children.
I'm so sorry, I'm having a hard time understanding your accent.
Ethel. Excuse me?
it's a name, for the children.
Ethel. "Ethel..."
little Ethel.
Yeah. We won't be naming our child Ethel.
maybe if he was a teenager...
my mother's third cousin was the Duke of Ethel.
we're a long line of "Ethel."
maybe... Maybe we'll keep it in the mix, maybe as a middle name...
so, Hannah, do you like the venison? It's delicious.
Colin shot it. He's a wonderful Shot.
stop, mum. You'll make me blush.
and this is the moment. I've just remembered.
what moment is that? When Colin killed the deer.
I filmed it.
right between the eyes.
in fact, everything we are eating this evening, Colin has killed.
to Colin! To Colin.
in your honor, Hannah.
that is so thoughtful...
I'm so sorry, I didn't kill anything for you...
Gosh...What did you get?
uhm... I love chocolate!
don't... Don't do that.
you want some...
here. I'll give you some.
excuse me. Reverend...
excuse me, sir. There you go. Wonderful dinner, by the way.
delighted, Tom. And your wife is beautiful.
thank you very much.
Thanks. Cheers.
a little birdie tells me that
Colin personally slayed each one of these reindeer heads...
Tom... Alright.
I say "a little birdie told me,"
he would have told me, but Colin shot it.
listen, seriously...
can we go somewhere private and talk? It's important.
Yeah. Should we go?
Bagpipes...
Oh, My God...
he's been playing the bag pipes ever since he was 3 years old. Practices every night.
every night? Never misses!
what kind of necklace is that? They're glow-in-the-dark thunder beets.
Hi, mom. I have something for you.
some evening, huh? Yes...
this is so you can have a little piece of home with you.
thank you.
look at you...
there's you and Melissa. You were about 5 there.
do you remember this?
it was taken at the lake, when you father broke his arm, because of that silly motorcycle of his.
I miss dad so much. Me too, Sweetheart.
I just wish that he could have been here.
he was always so worried, I was never gonna meet anyone.
no, he wasn't. That's Paris.
he could be so "off days" sometimes...
what?
well, it's just... He was always convinced that you were gonna marry Tom.
Really?
I'll see you in the morning. Good night, My Angel.
it's pulling off a band aid. You just have to close your eyes and do it.
I just haven't found the right time. What are you talking about, "right time"?
anytime is the right time to say "I love you, marry me."
right. Come on, what are you there for, man?
take the shot, win the game and bring her home!
and stop running up my long-distance phone bill with these crazy calls!
right, right okay. Thanks, Felix.
God, come on. You can do this, Tom.
what's wrong with me? You can do this.
I thought we could go for a walk and work on the vows.
good idea. I need some help. Good. Okay.
what do you think? I think a lot of things.
I've been working on them all week and I actually think they're getting worse.
at first I went for the "emotion,"
I thought: "What if Colin does it"?
then I tried to be funny...
I don't know if Scots have the same sense of humor as Americans.
so now I am back to something basic and I totally think I've geared off into something boring...
I'm crazy about you.
I think of you all the time and I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
Really?
really.
that's so "generic." Generic?
Yeah! Generic?
it totally is! How can that be generic?
it sounds like something you're supposed to say instead of what your really feeling.
alright. How about...
nobody in the world makes me laugh the way you do.
you're my best friend.
I just wanna be with you.
look, look! There she is!
let's go, let's go!
Hannah, let's go! What is this?
it's her "taking out." Her... What?
we dress her up and then we parade around one of the pubs in town.
that's weird... It's tradition!
Really? Then we fill a toilet with salt and we sell your kisses for change.
sell your kisses? Yep.
come on, it's like a Scottish Bachelorette-party.
okay, come on!
change for kisses! Right there...
instead of Whiskeys.
it's her "taking-out"! She's got the breath of an angel.
one more, alright, alright.
another! Another!
thank you.
this is all I have.
Oh, my God! My God, you guys! Let's go!
we have to get more kisses.
kisses!
I can't take it anymore! What are you doing?
let's do it again. No!
for old time's sake... Don't take that off.
I need to make this up to you... Don't... take... this.
no, I'm really unhappy.
that's fine. Tom...
it's okay. It's okay... I'm not happy at all.
get up... And I am in a really...
confusing place in my life right now...
confusing? Listen...
I have had some whiskey... I can tell.
and I need you to "service" me.
service you? I not gonna "service you..."
service me, bitch!
Oh, my... "Service me"!
be quiet! You be quiet.
everyone's sleeping...
get down. You can't get down.
you can't...
be quiet! You be quiet.
no. No! Get off!
wait... Wait...
Hannah... Bring me more whiskey.
Hannah.
it's Tom, let me in. Let me in.
go away, Tom.
no. Let me explain. It's not what you think.
it doesn't matter now. Yes it does. Why did you...
just... Go! I'll go. Just tell me, why did you come to my room?
Hannah... Why did you come to the room?
to talk about that kiss.
please, don't... Don't marry him.
all these years, Tom... Don't marry him...
all this time...
you're doing this now? I know...
how can you do this? I'm sorry... Just let me in.
no. I can't. Let me in.
you're only doing this now because you are afraid of losing me.
I need someone who's gonna be there for me, no matter what happens.
someone who truly... Loves me.
someone I can trust.
I'm marrying Colin tomorrow...Tom.
I can't be your Maid of Honor.
I can't give you away.
I'm sorry, Hannah.
I'm sorry, you and Tom had a fight.
I'm his best friend.
he's just afraid of loosing me.
he'll get over it.
suck it! Suck it. I am!
okay. Suck it in. Breath in...
hold it... I'm trying, my God.
I'll hold it in. Okay. Alright, alright.
give it to me. 1, 2, 3...
is it?... Oh, My God!
it fits, it fits!
it fits! Well done.
Oh no. No, no... My God... no...
why are we stopping? An early flock.
a... What?
Hi, Sweetheart.
I remember you.
hey
hi
I love you too.
thank you.
turn around, I have to go back.
Oh, no.
Oh no. Shit... Shit!
Hey, I need another ferry-boat. We only got the one ferry.
what? And it's waiting over there for the ceremony to finish.
is there another way to get there? You can drive.
drive... How long? It will take about an hour and a half...
that's too long. You can swim.
swim? Or you can go on trip around the shore.
that will take a wee while. Shore, right...
a horse! A horse. Hey, I need your horse.
my horse? Yes.
come down from there. I need to get to the church.
what do think you're planning, you great fool? You'll hurt yourself.
I'll give you 3 cents for every coffee collar used worldwide.
what? Do you have any idea how much money that is?
good luck to you, then. Her name's Nancy.
I'll see you over there.Thanks. Nancy, let's go!
stick to the shore... Pass the monument, the church is on the left.
what, in the name of the wee man, is a "Coffee collar"?
go, Nancy!
this is just what this nice dress needs...
and it goes across the dress. It looks really beautiful.
please, be seated.
we are gathered here together, in the sight of God...
give me your pin... to witness this congregation...
to join together this man...
this is a celebration of love.
for Colin, it's through the memories of seeing his parent's love.
...as a child. It looks very nice.
and for Hannah, it's through the paintings of Modigliani.
therefore, if any man can show just cause why these two may not be joined together...
let him now speak, or forever hold his peace.
Tom?
Tom?
Tom!
Tom! Tom?
Tom!
Tom...
Tom!
are you okay? Yeah, I think so.
Tom, what are you doing here? I have to tell you something...
Hannah...
your hair looks awful.
it does? Yeah.
what? And the sash...
it sucks.
but that hair...
it's like a co-op for parakeets. What?
look... Hannah...
I pride myself with being honest with everybody.
but there's somebody I've been lying to for a very long time. Myself.
because the truth it's... It's scary.
and 10 years ago I got in bed with the wrong girl.
she turned out to be the right one.
I love you, Hannah.
I always have... And I always will.
thomas Bailey...
you are the worst Maid of Honor of all time.
Oh, no.
I'm...
so...
very, truly, sorry.
I don't expect you to ever forgive me.
just so you know...
you are the perfect guy.
just not the perfect guy for me.
goodbye, Hannah.
Colin...
what did she say? She said I should dick you.
Oh yeah, that makes sense...
arsehole!
I do. And Tom, do you take Hannah to be your lawfully wedded wife? I do.
now, this is the moment.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
at last... You may kiss your bride.
Oh my God.
number six? Seven.
you're absolutely glowing tonight, grandma Pearl.
thank you. It's very nice of you to say so.
what are you doing?
I'm just making sure I got the right girl this time.
you do. Definitely.
Oh, Monica... Oh, Bill...
in times of tyranmy and injustice when law oppresses the people, the outlaw takes his place in history.
england at the turn of the 12th Century was such a time.
Nottingham
can somebody tell me what's going on?
don't be foolish, Walter. Get him back to bed.
bar the door. I'm still the master of this house.
Richard, up.
who is there?
wake up, Thomas.
open the gates!
bastards.
arrow.
the lantern.
I see you, you little bastards.
I see you!
thieving maggots.
they've taken all our seed grain.
what are we going to do for planting?
pray.
king Richard the Lion Heart, bankrupt of wealth and glory, is plundering his way back to England after ten years on his Crusade.
in his army is an archer named Robin Longstride.
this is the story of his return home where, for defending the weak against the strong, he will be condemned to live outside the law.
Hello, there!
CHALUS CASTLE FRANCE-1199 A. D.
here you go, lad. Thank you, Robin.
Robin.
the archers been called to ranks.
bloody typical. I'm starving.
hide these well.
we'll have them for supper instead.
sire.
your bath, Sire.
for the love of Christ, Loxley, would you stop them doing that!
they love you, Sire.
my head. It's going like the bells of hell.
is that it?
one more castle to sack, then we're home to England.
hail King Richard!
Release!
push!
push!
Hey, archer!
stay alive!
I'll see you tonight.
don't forget your money this time, little man.
it will be my pleasure to take it off you.
push!
move up!
cover the King! Cover the King!
barricades prepare!
let us put these French to bed!
raise the barricades!
Jimmy.
calm and careful. Make it count.
go!
help!
cover!
now.
go!
move back!
blood for France!
go!
it'll make a fine pin cushion!
king Philip's arse!
look what they do for the Lion Heart!
look what they do for the Lion Heart!
push!
push!
that'll burn all night, lads. Don't let them put it out.
these pricks will smash through in the morning, take all the credit.
well done, Jimmy boy.
tower OF LONDON ROYAL PALACE
John...
your Majesty.
an English princess shut out of her husband's bedchamber by a piece of French pastry!
aren't you ashamed?
the shame is surely his.
then go in and tell him.
mewling at his keyhole is neither one thing nor the other.
John.
Oh, God! What in heaven...
Mademoiselle, you will excuse me. My son has need of my advice.
no, I don't. Ask her.
mother, please, have you no decency?
I happen to be in a condition that no mother should see her son in.
alas, it's done.
Yes, I know, but it's my mother. That's enough.
on second thoughts,
I think it better that you do hear what I have to say.
though I will not have you in my presence.
mother.
the purpose of my being in this room is to save the realm from the consequences of this unsuitable amusement.
her uncle is the bloody King of France.
that's true.
my uncle is...Get down.
her uncle wants her back.
philip wants an excuse to cross the Channel with an army.
and you have given him that excuse.
take up your lawful wife and save England.
my lawful wife is as barren as a brick.
is that truly the wife you want for me?
you, who honored your husband with eight children so that even now when death has taken the rest you have a king and the runt of the litter to call you "Mother.
better the bastard of a servant girl than bed the niece of England's jealous enemy.
or bed her and wed her, Mother.
I've asked the Pope's men to arrange an annulment.
and do you think the Pope will favor England's royal runt over the King of France?
he might see his way for the son of Eleanor of Aquitaine.
and for the future King of England.
richard the Lion Heart is 40-years-old, if not more.
and no babies.
I am a queen in the making.
Yes. Yes.
you see?
she is my Eleanor.
now, you do understand, this game is not about luck.
it's about the science of memory and a quick hand.
who'd like to take a bit of fresh meat home?
caught this morning. We have a pheasant.
three choices. Right, left or middle?
middle.
the middle," he says. The middle.
I'm sorry about those onions, young man. You lose.
Robin! Over here, they're needed for the pot.
feisty one!
aye, what else we got, what else we got?
the fire will do its work.
we break through at first light.
with a fair wind, we can be home in three days.
you return to Nottingham?
I have a wife who waits for me.
I have a mother that won't die and a brother who wishes me dead.
first thing I'm going to do is lock them up.
your people will rejoice to see you return home.
and that is a condition I would like to keep them in.
to be remembered as I was.
my army knows better.
lion Heart is mangy.
every man in that army idolizes you, Your Majesty.
don't mollycoddle me.
I understand how difficult it must be to befriend a king.
come on, Loxley. Let us find some ruffians, drink and laugh.
let us see if we can find an honest man.
Yes.
let's do that.
well, that's the thing, little man. This is not a game of luck.
it's about the science of memory and a quick hand.
I've got a quick eye. I'll be watching you.
three choices.
right, left, or middle.
I think I'll take a fourth choice.
a fourth?
I've been watching you for a while now, Longstride.
there is no pea.
this game is a trick!
you take out the pea when you're doing your slidings and your turnings.
I got you.
don't touch it again.
I'll do it!
you lose.
you're doing better than you think.
get in there, Robin.
kneel, you ignorant bastards!
kneel before the King!
all of you, move back, now.
no, no, Loxley. These men are soldiers at play.
sinners after mine own heart.
which one of you started the fight?
I did, Sire.
I threw the first punch.
Ah, honest man.
and who're you fighting?
he was fighting me, Your Majesty.
I thought him to be a lesser man.
he was showing me different.
an enemy that shows his respect.
stand up, the pair of you.
not you.
brave and honest.
are you honest enough to tell a king something that he does not want to hear?
what is your opinion on my crusade?
will God be pleased with my sacrifice?
no, he won't.
why do you say that?
the massacre at Acre, Sire.
speak up!
when you had us herd 2, 500 Muslim men, women, and children together, the young woman at my feet, with her hands bound, she looked up at me.
there wasn't fear in her eyes. There wasn't anger.
there was only pity.
for she knew that when you gave the order and our blades would descend upon their heads, that, in that moment, we would be godless.
all of us.
godless.
honest, brave and naive.
there is your Englishman.
right there.
well done, Robin. You showed him.
the whipping will be the worst of it.
the branding iron, that will be the worst.
unless they hang us.
no. No, this will be the worst of it.
and this will be the end of it. As soon as I get out of here, I'm gone.
I don't owe God or any other man here one more minute of service.
Fontainebleau BANKS OF THE SEINE FRANCE
your weapon, Godfrey
Majesty.
philip of France.
please.
have you known John for a long time?
as a matter of fact, yes.
in English, please.
we go all the way back to the same breast.
wet nurse.
indeed.
we've been close ever since.
good.
because England, under your friend John, is a country with no fighting spirit.
I can take London with an army of cooks.
but Richard is on his way home.
and under Richard, England is a different animal altogether.
richard will return home through the Forest of Broceliande.
we know the exact place.
he always travels ahead of his army with only a few trusted knights around him.
with Richard dead, it will be easy for you to turn the country against John.
there'll never be a better moment to invade.
even dying animals can be obstinate.
kill the Lion Heart and you will be richly rewarded.
at your service, my lord.
it is I who is indebted to you.
heave!
heave!
time to eat!
come and eat soup!
heave!
for England!
for England!
I killed the King!
look!
I killed the King!
I need a physician here!
a physician! Quickly!
give us cover! Give us cover, now!
cover him!
cover the King.
physician!
why, Loxley? Are you not feeling well?
physician!
wine.
what's this?
the King is dead!Dead?
dead.
all right, then, Jimmy. Knock the pegs out.
we make our own fate from now on!
I'll come with you.
no, you're not. We don't take strays.
the more the merrier.
the road will be dangerous. He might be useful.
where we going?
to the coast and to a boat before 3, 000 desperate soldiers get there and the price for a Channel crossing goes up a hundredfold.
what about our wages?
if you thought it was hard getting wages while he was alive, try getting paid by a dead king.
all right, boys, collect your gear as quick as you can.
Nottingham
I like the new church.
lady Marion.
I would have been sorry to leave without your farewell. Thank you.
I'm glad to speed you on your way, Father Tancred, but it was to seek out our new shepherd.
you have lately been missed at Sunday worship and my sermons.
I like a quiet church, Father, when I pray for a miracle.
your new flock is women, children and old folk.
our men have gone to war or returned broken.
their orphans run wild in the greenwood.
our fields are ready for planting but we've no seed corn.
and the church barn is full of grain.
surely, you do not expect the church to let its corn be used to plant your fields?
that grain is bound for York.
I am Friar Tuck.
father Tancred is elevated to York where I know he will remind the Bishop that the people of Nottingham...
the Bishop does not need reminding that the people of Nottingham should reap what they sow and repent of their sins.
the miracle I pray for is that the Bishop show some Christian charity.
as I said, Father, I like a quiet church when I pray.
you will have trouble from the Loxleys of Peper Harow.
you keep bees, Tuck?
I keep them and they keep me.
BROCELIANDE FOREST FRANCE
stop!
ambush!
find him.
take all you want.
Where's the Lion Heart?
Richard, where are you?
you're a knight?
where is King Richard?
Oh, God.
where is the King?
dead? Dead?
Really?
if the King's dead, where are you going?
deliver the crown.
Richard's crown.
Richard's crown.
how do we assassinate a king who's already dead?
bring me the crown. It's in the saddle bag.
the Crown!
Hurry!
bring back the crown! Kill the horse!
you are English.
when it suits me.
who are you?
robert Loxley.
that's the King's horse.
Jimmy! Move!
Jimmy!
Robin, they're French.
ambush.
what's happening?
move!
go.
John.
don't know.
he's dead.
help.
my sword.
its value to me is great.
it belonged to my father,
sir Walter Loxley of Nottingham.
do you know it?
aye, I've heard of Nottingham.
then the fate...
the fates have smiled on me.
you must take the sword to my father.
it will bring me peace.
I took it in anger and without his consent.
you must understand the bond of love between a father and his son.
my father abandoned me to the world of men when I was six years old.
I know little of the love between father and son.
I beg you.
longstride, say you will.
I will.
it's a pact sworn in blood, Robin.
it's a scratch, Allan, and that's all it is.
Robin!
Loxley was making for the coast to meet the ship.
that crown could be our passage home.
we're common archers, Robin.
if we arrive at the King's ship with his crown, we'll be accused of murder.
how do you know that the knights you see walking about are actually knights at all?
there is no difference between a knight and any other man aside from what he wears.
all we need is about us.
armor, helmets, swords, and we make England wealthy men with horses and gold.
fate has smiled upon us at last.
and I, for one, shall not turn my back on her.
take that crown off your head, Will, and fill it to the brim.
we commit the soul of this boy to your keeping, Lord.
we would ask, when he arrives at the gates of eternity, if you could let him in.
Goliath's got the soil turning nicely. But for what?
Nettles? Nettle soup and dandelion salad, that'll keep us alive.
come, Goliath. This way.
until we get a miracle.
this way.
Marion, Sheriff.
Marion, I've been at Peper Harow, waiting in vain for Sir Walter to receive me.
kindly tell him I have better things to do than haunt his threshold.
that you have, while robbers are roaming free in Sherwood.
that's sheriff's business. Why don't you look to it?
tell the old fool that next time, I'll break his door down.
and if he's too proud to pay...
no, no, no, no. He's not too proud.
he's too poor.
in the name of King Richard, you have stripped our wealth to pay for foreign adventures.
whilst at home, the Church, in the name of the merciful God, has reaped, without mercy, the largest share of what we had set aside to feed ourselves.
between a sheriff and a bishop, I wouldn't care to judge who's the greater curse on honest English folk.
Marion, why, oh, why do you make an enemy of me when you have the means to make me your protector?
what means?
if you leave now,
I will lengthen your life by not telling my husband of your visit when he returns home.
your husband? After 10 years?
if he's not dead, he's rutting his way through the brothels of the Barbary Coast.
so speaks a man of experience.
well, think on it, Marion.
sir Walter is dying without an heir.
peper Harow will fall to the crown, and you will be living in the hedgerow.
you'll be glad to come to me then.
northern COAST OF FRANCE
captain, there.
sir, we were told to expect 12 riders and the King.
our beloved King is dead.
long live the King.
long live the King.

sir Robert Loxley of Nottingham. And you?
I'm the King's equerry, Sir.

We're in a hurry boys. We got a long way to go. We'll sing and we'll dance And bid farewell to France And row, me bully boys, row
so what's the plan in the morning?
the boat stops at Gravesend on the way to London.
we'll leave the honor of returning the crown to them, and we'll be gone.
where?
North.
well, that suits me.
row, me bully boys, row. But now we're returning. So lock up your daughters
rise and rise roam

Thames ESTUARY ENGLAND
make ready, Sir Robert. We dock in 20 minutes.
Gravesend?
no, My Lord. The palace docks, Tower of London.
will.
John Allan.
where are we? London.
holy Christ!
we dock in 10 minutes.
when this is done, be ready to ride.
what if... What if Loxley is known to the King's mother or brother or any of them?
then we'll be riding for our lives.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Peter and Paul and Mary!
I knew it! I knew it!
good morning, My Lord.
some words of advice on this tragic occasion.
you appreciate everything must be done correctly, so you will present the crown to Lady Eleanor.
you will go down on the right knee.
do not look in her eyes when you tell her the King is no more.
and do not rise until all others rise. Do you understand?
Yes.
Agnes.
my blue and gold brocade.
Yes, My Lady.
part for the Queen.
part for the Queen.
cease.
what's this? What's happening?
king Richard returns from France, My Lord.
did Loxley deceive us?
kneel.
long life, my son.
rise now.
a king is dead.
long live the King.
long live the King!
long live the King! Long live the King!
long live the King! Long live the King!
rise.
you...
I don't know you.
robert Loxley, Sire, of Nottingham.
welcome then.
and how did my brother die?
in battle, Your Majesty, as was his way.
as was his way.
you deserve a reward...
let's get the horses.
for bringing home the news.
kneel.
did you say you were from Nottingham?
Yes.
your father, Sir Walter, owes tax to the crown.
my crown.
tell him it's bloody expensive running a country and everyone's got to pay their way.
we'll start with this.
make way for the King!
make way!
your Majesty.
make way for the King!
make way! Godfrey.
Godfrey, my friend. It's so good to see you.
how were your travels? Good, Sire.
what happened to your face?
a hunting accident. It's nothing.
frightening, Your Majesty.
call it a dueling scar. The ladies will love you all the more.
I bow to your knowledge of the ladies, Sire.
you can get up now.
sir Robert.
you will know of me, perhaps. I'm William Marshal.
your father and I were young men together.
tell him I'm coming to visit him soon, on spring's first black night.
I may have need of him.
I will. I'll tell him.
whoever he is and whatever he is, he knows too much.
get rid of him.
come on, let's follow.
forfeit what you got.
victuals, coin, clothing or your life.
thomas Cooper.
is that you?
are you sick, Thomas?
we're all sick.
where are the rest of you? Don't... Don't tell her.
loop will be angry.
no, it's your mother who's going to be angry.
now, either you come with me, or I come with you.
you choose.
well, come on then. Where are they?
answer me.
four men, five horses, one gray.
have you seen them? That way.
the living king of sermons. Was delivered from his evil. But he couldn't talk his last. Because God took out his throat. God's crossbow took out his throat.
by Christ! Can you not sing a happy tune?
sing a foot-stomper about adventure and daring and courage.
no. Sing something about a woman.
a large woman.
fancy army, darling I loves you all to bits, I'll climb up to your chamber And under your mountainous...
right. I'm done. The money's divided.
and so should we be.
where will you go?
I think something is owed for this good fortune, and I mean to pay it back.
how so?
the inscription on the sword, it taunts my memory.
maybe it's just my imagination, I don't know.
but I intend to take that sword back to its owner and fulfill the request of his dying son.
are you mad?
you just said we were in danger, Robin.
now you choose to step back in to harm's way?
they're bound to go there and find you.
we can't repay our good luck with bad grace. It invites darkness.
I'm going with you. And I, Robin.
Yes. No.
tonight is our last in company.
tomorrow, we go our separate ways.
pack up your share. We eat and sleep.
will, you're on first watch.
will.
watch your step!
one of them got away.
bastards! They've stolen my fortune.
Richard's army is coming home.
it costs money to keep it together. Marshal, you speak for the money.
I do, Sire.
but to disband the army could cost more than to keep it.
why, Chancellor?
king Richard's campaigns were costly. And the expected returns...
what is that to me, Marshal?
my brother's troubles are over!
they're over!
clear the room.
so... Taxation.
taxation?
milking a dry udder gets you nothing but kicked off the milking stool.
mother, spare me your farmyard memories.
you have none, and I don't understand them.
these are difficult times.
we can buy time.
I can send envoys to secure loans.
there are money chests from Sicily to Normandy if you know where to look.
cap-in-hand to moneylenders?
your master's a king.
the crown is owed money at home.
the northern barons plead poverty, but that's always been the song of rich men.
so, what's to be done?
give me leave, Sire, to go north with a company of mounted men.
I'll have the merchants and landowners fill your coffers or their coffins.
englishmen killing Englishmen.
no man loyal to the crown has anything to fear.
and loyalty means paying your share in the defense of the realm.
that's well said.
hmm? Don't you think, Marshal?
mother?
richard commanded loyalty not by threats but by example.
mother, your sainted son was an imbecile.
and you supported his every folly from here to Jerusalem and back.
Yes, you worshipped him when the warrior lost territories hard won by his father.
you kissed his picture while England had to pay four years' revenue to ransom him when he was captured.
you are just as much to blame as anyone for the wreckage which is my inheritance.
I broke her skin more than she did mine.
chancellor.
marshal, you served my brother faithfully and my father before him.
I think you've spent enough time with my family and, no doubt, would like to spend more with your own.
therefore, and with regret,
I accept your resignation of all your offices and matters of state.
the ring.
your Majesty.
choose carefully, Godfrey, the spot where you would place your dagger.
for I will choose carefully, as well.
open the gates!
Nottingham
Nottingham.
is this your people, Robin? I don't know. Might be.
they don't look much, these Middle Englanders.
well, they've been keeping your lot in place easy enough, haven't they?
I hear that you Welsh boys, you live on leeks.
you co-habit with sheep.
bloody Scottish mule.
you wouldn't want to annoy a bee hive with your noise, would you?
your swords would be no good then, gentlemen.
you're the town beekeeper?
bless you, no. I'm the friar. Tuck's the name.
well, Friar Tuck, can you tell me where I might find Sir Walter Loxley?
if he's not up at Peper Harow...
how long will your business take?
stay safe.
God be with you all.
that's it?
after 10 years?
good Friar, where can a man get, well, moderately insensible on a drink around here?
Allan, he's a man of the cloth. I'm sorry, Friar.
have you coin? I have coin.
two pieces.
each.
have you tried the honey liquor we call mead?
come with me.
gives a man a halo, does mead.
girl.
girl?
either you're going blind or you're looking for charity.
are you the keeper of this house?
in a manner of speaking, yes.
I wish to see Sir Walter Loxley.
and you are?
Robin Longstride.
plain Robin Longstride? No Sir?
no, ma'am. No Sir.
are you here about the tax?
no, I'm here to bring him his sword. His son's dead.
this way.
he'll take your horse.
Marion!
Marion!
Maggie, where is she?
ma'am, Sir Walter calls for you.
I know, Margaret. I can hear him.
tell him we have a guest.
I'm Marion Loxley. Robert's wife.
my Lady, I owe you an apology. If I'd have known...
bad news is bad news no matter how it comes.
indeed, I owe you thanks for taking the time to deliver it here yourself.
did you fight alongside my husband?
Yes.
did he die well?
in an ambush, ma'am.
he was the man chosen to bring home Richard's crown.
Marion, who is here?
a traveler, Walter.
this news will go very hard on him.
bring him in.
Yes, yes.
tell him Robert is in the Holy Land, sends his love and will return soon.
Marion, our traveler will be thirsty.
travelers are always thirsty. Is that not so?
your name, sir?
Longstride. Robin Longstride.
do you mock me?
sir?
your son, he asked me to bring you this.
and how does Robert defend himself if he has no sword?
the prodigal son will not return after all.
so, no tears, no forgiveness from his father.
no amends to be made.
did you see him die?
I was with him when he passed.
his final words were for the love and bond between a father and son.
forgive my rudeness.
my grief has been waiting for this day.
so come, so that I may see you.
Robin Longstride.
a common enough but noble Saxon name.
so, you will dine with us.
but first, you must bathe, sir.
you stink.
I've laid out some of my husband's clothes.
I hope you don't find that too discomforting.
my Lady,
I'll need some help with the chain mail.
Winifred.
Winifred.
the coif has a clasp at the nape of the neck.
if you take off the coif, you'll find lacings in the back of the tabard.
thank you.
I'll have it washed.
Marion, more wine.
you've taken a long road to bring this to me.
I cannot decide whether that makes you trustworthy...
or manipulative.
Marion, I'm merely trying to gauge the quality of the man we have as our guest.
is he handsome?
Yes.
in the way that yeomen sometimes are when they are sober.
entertain us with a tale of your life, sir.
we don't get many visitors anymore.
except tax collectors and other beggars.
I don't know where I'm from. Only know where I've been.
so, Marion, what color are his eyes?
I don't yet know.
I have a proposal for you, young man.
you brought me this sword, which has great meaning.
if you give me your time, it is yours.
I could stay for a day, or more.
I have a question to ask you. And what is your question?
the words on the hilt of the sword, what do they mean?
well, I think I have much to tell you about history. About your history.
that's very kind.
well, you haven't heard the other half of my proposal yet.
I want you to stay in Nottingham and, for the time being, become my returned son, and therefore Marion's spouse.
Oh, that's enough!
you've had too much to drink. Listen. Listen. Listen.
we both know that without a husband you will lose this land when I die.
do you dispute that? Hmm?
no. No, so if I say this is my son, he will be seen as that. And, so, as your husband. Huh?
it is a fair contract.
it is not as if I expect you to have children or...
no, the sword for your time, Longstride.
are you in agreement?
Yes，Marion, go tell the staff that my son has arrived and our home is now whole again.
tell them to ring the church bells in celebration.
and more wine, please.
I rose up in the morning. And I felt a dire need. To dream away the dreary day and down a cup of mead. I felt the sting of honeybees
home brew.
if I wasn't the village priest, I'd try for the village drunkard.
Oh, great.
a man could get very affectionate here.
I haven't seen so many women for so few men outside a nunnery.
the secret to success is never go for the prettiest one.
start with the homely one on the left.
right there.
she's about my size. I'm going to make her smile.
I'm going to make you smile!
come over here!
so, why do they call you Little John?
what are you trying to get at?
I'm proportionate.
so roll another barrel to the bar. And pour another cup or two so I can soak my heart
Hampton BAY SOUTHERN COAST OF ENGLAND
stop it.
what did I tell you?
it seems we are to share my chamber.
a ruse to convince the servants.
well, if the aim is deception, should you not be addressing me as "My husband," or, "My dear"?
don't be ridiculous.
well, are you coming or not?
ask me nicely.
please, dear husband, will you share my chamber?
here.
I sleep with a dagger.
if you so much as move to touch me, I will sever your manhood.
you understand?
thanks for the warning.
Hello, dogs.
how are you, my friend?
good, thank you.
they drank plenty.
...and are waiting for you.
200 French soldiers landed this night at Hampton Bay. I will follow.
Godfrey.
where are your men?
they're dead, My Lord.
and Loxley?
alive.
then fate has left him to me.
let's move!
on to Barnsdale!
I hear a man's steps. Good morning, my son.
morning, Walter.
father.
father.
so what is it that you know of my history?
patience.
you must show yourself today. Wear your sword.
Marion.
I'm here, Walter.
reacquaint your husband with his village and his people.
I'll see to the horses.
I feel invigorated.
I woke this morning with a tumescent glow.
eighty-four.
a miracle.
I've always wondered at the private conversations of men.
husband.
this is rich country.
Where's your cattle and your sheep?
sold, eaten, stolen, traded. We've had seven lean years.
our meat now is rabbit or wild pig on a lucky day.
and deer?
if you're willing to risk your neck to the King's executioner.
every deer in the land belongs to His Majesty.
these things are God's gifts first before the King's possessions.
if it's illegal for a man to fend for himself how then can he be a man in his own right?
welcome home, sir.
sir Robert. Good morning, Joseph. Emma.
sir Walter is our Lord, and you are Robert returned and you should act so.
sir Robert. You remember me?
Tom Chamberlain. Pig farmer.
you don't look a day older, Tom.
sir Robert.
when will our young lads come back to us?
will you find my Jamie, tell him to come home?
with no work and little food, the village boys have gone.
to be soldiers? Poachers.
look at that, mate.
still here then?
for the time being, refer to me as Sir Robert. I'll explain later.
my men-at-arms. This is about as courtly as they get.
Allan A'Dayle, Will Scarlet and Little John.
lady Marion.
I trust you had an historic evening.
for sure.
lady Marion Loxley. My wife.
well played.
a bit rash but well played nonetheless.
right you are, Robin.
sir Robert.
sir Robert. Sir...
sir. Sir.
sir Bob. Sir Robert.
friar.
Ah, Marion. Good news travels from Peper Harow this morning.
sir Robert, nice to see you again.
you should've made yourself known when we met in the field.
welcome home.
Yes, I should've. Forgive me, Friar.
what happens here?
we're moving the Church's grain to York.
politics out of London, I hear.
this is our grain. It belongs in this soil.
lady Marion, I but follow the orders of my superiors and abide by their saying and rule.
does His Holiness know about your wealth of honey?
there are wolves in York, Sir Robert. Voracious wolves.
the bees are my family.
I'm a procreator by design.
I'm not a churchy friar. Never was.
my bees give life.
they are my life, Sir Robert.
should not the Bishop be told so the clergy can spread Nottingham honey on Nottingham bread?
what if the grain were not to reach York?
then the bees need not be spoken of.
I was an old maid when Robert courted me.
I was a daughter of a respectable widow with a thimbleful of noble blood.
we were wed, and then a week later he left to join ship for France and the Holy Lands.
and that was my married life to a man
I hardly knew.
a good knight.
short, but sweet.
I mean, he was a good knight.
a good knight-at-arms, a soldier.
Oh, yes, my knight-in-arms, even so.
and I in his.
stop! You'll break its neck.
Marion.
easy.
I'm all right.
I can't move me legs.
I can't move me legs.
thank you.
my Lord?
Oh, is it my turn now?
thank you.
nicely done, sir.
and to see Lady Marion Loxley's legs, beyond my wildest hopes this morning.
I don't believe you know my husband,
sir Robert.
allow me to introduce the Sheriff of Nottingham.
welcome home, Sir Robert.
you make your mark quickly by rescuing the King's ram from drowning.
what's this?
what's mine in coin I have the right to take in goods or livestock.
if it's God's will.
here's a ram's worth of tax for the Exchequer.
your insolence to Lady Marion, I'll consider a debt between us.
mead and grain alcohol?
I thought as much.
there's something that we need to do.
at your service.
all right, lads.
should've left while you had the chance. Something's afoot. Off we go.
stop. Stop the horses.
Hello, my name is Sean Anders. Screenwriter and director of Sex Drive.
Hi, John. I didn't see you there.
this is John Morris. - Screenwriter and producer of Sex Drive.
welcome to the unrated... - Uncircumcised...
...edition of...
...Sex Drive. - Sex Drive.
how many times has this happened to you?
you purchase an unrated DVD to view with your friends. Only with your friends...
only to find that you got the same old movie with a few extra curse words, and maybe an additional tit or two.
what a jip. - And how...
not this time.
that's right, John. On this unrated DVD we promise you, the viewer, a genuinely wacky, zany and unrated viewing experience.
we promise... - Plus, we promise more tits.
bare tits like these.
these tits are good.
Plus, more cock, like this.
that's good cock, John.
that's right, John, and that's not all, we promise lots of additional scenes, takes and other bullshit that will make the movie way too long.
and this means a lower standard of filmmaking for you, - the viewer. - The viewer.
so, if you've never seen Sex Drive before, please, for real, do not watch this version first.
watch the real theatrical version and then come back and watch this one.
Why?
Yes, because this version of the movie is going to suck.
sorry, but I couldn't help but notice you. I have this exact same tribal tattoo.
mine's one my... It's on my back.
but actually I have a town car outside if you wanna go see...
all right. Why don't you do one more?
we open up against Michigan in two weeks.
coach's got me hitting the bench pretty hard.
shit. How much is a lot?
one... No, two.
I'm putting up three hundy.
well, let's see, Tasty.
Wow!
um...
wow, you're really pretty. I've never seen...
no, stop it, stop it.
don't be so fucking desperate. Come on, be a dick. Be cool.
don't be a pussy. Tell her she's an ugly skank.
Yeah.
not bad.
I've seen better.
Yeah, whatever.
coach's got us running two-a-days, so I gotta bounce.
miss Tasty? How did you get here?
Shh!
Ian, wake up, faggot. Judge rolls in 20, so if you want a ride to work you better get your poop in a group.
okay, I'll be right down. - No. Now, Clay Aiken.
all right. - No, now, homo.
just give me a minute. - No, no, no, no. Now, sissy.
just... - No, now, chode-stroker.
now, ball bag.
hey...
Ow! Cut it out. - Hurts, doesn't it?
shut up! I'm trying to sleep.
Hey, Big D, sorry. Go back to sleep. You're golden.
you, get your ass up. - Give me a minute.
What're you doing under there, huh?
What're you doing? You're firing off your skin pistol?
come on, get up. What are you hiding?
you got a big fattie under there, don't you?
Yeah, you do. You're stroking it, too. What the F?
your little brother's sleeping not ten feet away. Jesus Christ!
good. My boys are all here.
dad, Ian's free... - Can it, Rex.
your pop's got a bombshell to drop, so ears open.
last night, your old man popped the question.
show them, Karen.
I'm so happy.
Hey, way to go!
Ian, you wanna get off your duff and come over here and give Karen a hug?
um...
Yeah, Ian, come on. You're being rude. - Can we do that later?
damn it, Ian, get up... - No, no, honey. It's okay.
we have to give him time to get used to the idea.
Karen? - Are you okay?
Karen? Karen, honey? - You okay?
sweetheart?
what smells like jizz?
let's go! Kick it in the ass, dildo!
come on, get in. Get in!
you suck!
okay, seriously. Quit being such a fag and get in.
Ian, I'm gonna ask you a question, and I want a straight answer.
you queer? - What?
God damn it! I knew it! - I didn't say anything.
exactly. If someone asks you if you're a pole smoker, you just deny it, straight off. No pause, no farting around.
Rex, I'm not gay.
dad thinks you're gay. - What?
you're breaking the old man's heart. - No, I'm not. I told him I'm not.
Ian, you're 18, and you've never had a girlfriend.
that's how people wind up getting gay, you know.
I don't think that's really how it happens.
is that not how it happens? So tell me how it happens, expert.
fucking cock expert. Cockspert.
Hey, what do you like better, the shaft or the balls?
that's gross. - You like them both, don't you?
it's like, sometimes like, Tuesdays you want the big, old fucking shiny-ass cock, and Wednesdays and Thursdays you're on to the balls.
I don't know why you're talking about it. - You can't choose, can you?
that's a tough one. You love it and you're obsessed with it.
no, you are. You keep talking about it.
Why're you smiling at me? I'm serious.
don't fucking smile at me. You know I'll knock you out of this goddamn earth.
what does it taste like?
like, right when you take your mouth off and it's like kind of like you can almost see your reflection in that fucking cock.
smack you in the face with it a little bit.
you don't like that? - I don't eat...
just cut. Just like, shiny fucking stiff, hot vascular mushroom head.
Yeah, yeah.
look, every guy's got a fantasy about another guy, but you got to bury that shit way down. This is America, God damn it.
there is... There is a girl that I've been kind of...
all right, I'm listening. Where'd you meet her?
on the... Online.
what? For fuck's sake, Ian, don't you watch Dateline?
she's probably a guy. Some fat old dude who wants to ram you in the tailpipe.
but you'd love that, wouldn't you? 'Cause you're a homo.
Hey, Ian. Try not to come home any gayer than you are now.
seriously, though. You're a fag.
Hey, don't look at me like that. I'll punch you in the goddamn throat.
Hey, Becca. How are you? - I'm good. I'm fine. Whatever.
Hey, Becca. Looks like you had a long, nasty night.
Ron and Ian want the four-one-uno. - Whatever. You guys are gross.
I'm not gross. I didn't say anything. - Okay, who's going on coupon rounds?
no, Becca, I did it yesterday. - Please, Ian.
I love you so much.
hello. This is a coupon for six free... No? Okay. Sorry. Donuts? No.
six free donuts with the Bandito's Dozen. - Thanks.
you're welcome. Sorry.
excuse me. Do you know where the Gap is?
it's just past the movie theater. - Thanks, man.
Yeah, real funny.
free donuts, free coupons.
Felicia. How's it fitting, hon?
well, you look nice.
you know, sweetie, there's still time to have your boobs done before my wedding.
Darren and I already discussed them, and he said he'd pay for it.
I mean, he's a dentist, so it's totally not a big deal.
excuse me, do you have a pair of scissors?
Oh! Sure, sweetie. Do you have a stringie?
Oh, no. I was just hoping you could slit my wrists for me quickly.
my husband killed himself last Christmas.
I am so sorry. I was just...
hello. This is a coupon for six free donuts. Donuts?
Oh, my God! You look so hot in that.
Hey, sweetheart, listen. Please don't take this the wrong way, but your whole trying too hard thing, it's just coming across as needy, you know?
and I think you're better than that, Kimberly.
but all I was saying was that... - Shh! Let's see it in a large. Okay?
I mean, Christ, I'm out buying him clothes right now.
he's 18 years old. I don't have to do that shit anymore.
look, Judy, listen, I'm sorry, I'm losing you. I'm going into a tunnel.
well, it's official, Lance, your mom's still bat-shit crazy.
what? You're telling me she doesn't shit-talk me?
no, actually, she doesn't. She doesn't, ever.
all right. Let me give you some advice, Lance, all right?
don't ever get married. Just an endless parade of horseshit.
and whatever you do, man, always wear a rubber. Christ.
nice. Always classy.
Hey, come on, Lance, I didn't mean it like... Come on, dawg.
Hey, sir. I've got something yummy for your little girl.
Oh, my God. Excuse me! Sorry!
Ian? Oh, my God, dude, what happened? - I don't know.
is there a cock and balls on the front of me again?
like a little tree trunk. - Thank you.
Oh, my God.
whoa. You look pretty. - God, shut up, Ian!
what? I'm just saying, you usually dress so... You look nice.
Ian, why do you got to work the mouth when you talk to us?
Yeah, Ian. - Sorry, it's a... It's a habit.
Hey, that girl you work with, Becca, you gonna bring her to my party tonight?
Yeah, I asked her. She said no. - Good. Dude, she's totally wrong for you.
that's what you say about everyone.
she made you wear the fucking costume again, right?
you know, I don't mind... - Dude, if you told her to fuck off, she'd be two knuckles deep right now daydreaming about your big black cock.
Ian, do not listen to him.
okay, girls want a nice guy who's gonna treat them well.
Really? - Yes. Really.
look, all I'm saying is everybody wants a challenge.
everybody wants... - What they can't get. I know, I got it.
do you get it? 'Cause I mean, it feels like I'm teaching you to walk sometimes.
that shit does not work. - It works on you.
no, it doesn't.
balls! I got to go. Evil cousin's spending the weekend.
pretty cousin? - Ian, she's the anti-Christ.
she's still super hot. - Fuck you, too. See you.
so what happened with Becca?
you been doing like I told you, being a dick?
Yeah, kind of. Being kind of a dick. I'd say... No, not really.
I mean, you know, I've sort of been practicing your whole being-a-dick thing with this girl I met online.
and I get it, but I just... - Thanks.
I don't think I could do that for real.
dude, sure you can. I believe in you, you know.
you just got to stop worrying about being the good guy all the time.
I mean, okay, look at Andy and Randy over there.
you think they care what women think about them?
they could give a fuck.
what's up? What's up? - What's up, what's up?
Hi. I'm collecting for the underprivileged children of Ecuador.
would you like to help? - Not really.
we don't have any money. - No jobs.
you wanna party?
um... I'm kind of working right now.
when are you done? - Yeah, what are you doing after?
I have a church thing tonight.
kick ass, we'll come. - Yeah, where is it?
is there gonna be more hot snatch like you there?
those guys are total nards. They never get anywhere.
that's just 'cause they don't know how to close.
but they're ability to open is fucking heroic.
do you wear thong underpants? - Do you want us to take our shirts off?
what color bra are you wearing? - Is your mom hot, too?
are you into me?
where do you live? - What color car do you have?
where do you live? - What's your address?
do you want us to come over? - Do you like pizza?
we've been to a motel.
fuck off, donut. - Rex, it's me.
what the fuck is this all about?
I broke the key off of our locker. I couldn't get my clothes out.
stow that shit in the trunk. Christ, you look like a Mexican butt-hole.
you suck.
Becca? Hey.
wow, I didn't know that you were coming over.
cool. I didn't even know that you knew where I lived. I mean...
Yeah, I do. - Yeah.
so... - Oh! It's a funny story. I broke...
I broke my key off and Ron let me borrow the...
anyway, so this is great. You changed your mind.
now, the party, it doesn't start - for a few hours. - Actually, I was wondering if Dylan's here.
Dylan? - Yeah. Is he here?
my 14-year-old brother Dylan? - Yeah.
nice underpants, Ian. - Snap! Dang, that was funny.
you know he's 14, right?
Laura Cindy, this shit is totally gratuitous. I love it.
Hey, congrats. Good to see you. - Hey.
is this the plan?
Ian, dude, there's like 80 wet chicks here. Get off your wallflower ass.
are you smoking cigars now? - Yes.
Hey, Lance. Tight party. - Okay, rude.
you can see I'm having a conversation here.
now, I'll be with you in a few minutes, okay?
thank you. - We're sorry.
don't apologize to her. - I'm sorry.
don't apologize to me.
Hey, I'm gonna go see who Felicia's talking to.
no, dude, forget Felicia, okay?
I know you guys are BFF and all that shit, but tonight's about getting that dick a little daylight.
Hey, Lindsay, sweetheart, where you going?

you know my boy Ian? - Yeah. No. I don't know.
you used to be on my paper route. - Okay, sure. My mom likes you.
fucking A your mom likes Ian. Look at him. He's a big, bright crimson king. Right?
you know what else?
Ian is a bust-ass virgin.
I'm so sorry.
don't let that deter you from fucking him.
Yeah. No, I'm pretty stoked. I got into the University of Wisconsin, and I'm gonna go for veterinary medicine, 'cause that's where...
are you gonna go to college? - University of Boulder.
it's a great party school.
you know, I read that they have a really great astronomy program.
I don't know if that's what you're going there for or...
because it's really high elevation, and you can see the stars really well...
planets.
Wow! A little tip action there. That's really suggestive.
I'm not saying that you're gonna do that on my, well...
you can just stick with my finger if you want 'cause this feels great, so...
you're really good at that. That's really wet. Two...
Ian! Dude! - I'm... Could you excuse me for a second?
hello. Hello?
Hey! - Hey! What up?
what are you doing in there, man? - What're you doing out here, man?
I asked you first. - Nothing.
no, I just... I spilled beer on my shirt, so then I had to...
I thought you had, like, a girl in there. - Yeah, right. I wish.
so, okay. So, are your parents, like, still going to Dylan's motor-cross thing this weekend?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They all take off in the morning.
okay. Awesome.
cause my evil cousin is driving me nuts, so, I don't know, you think, like, maybe I could hang at your place this weekend?
Yeah. Yeah, like a sleepover or something. It'll be fun.
Oh, my God! Thank you so much. Hey, I have a secret.
okay. - But it's like a girl secret, so...
can you handle it? Are you sure? Okay. - Yeah.
Hey, Dibits, fuck off.
okay, so I... Oh, my God, this is so lame.
look at you acting like such a girl. - I know, I know. Okay, okay. Here it is.
I have a crush on someone, a boy, a guy.
yeah? Well, who is it?
come on, you know me better than anyone. I bet you know who it is.
come on, guess.
um...
I think I know.
I'm kidding. Oh, God! I got you. You're so easy. You're so easy!
you're my best friend. - I know, and you're my best friend.
that's why it's funny that we would kiss, because we wouldn't.
so who is it? Who's the lucky caballero?
um... Nobody.
nobody? - I... I was kidding, too.
that is funny. - It's hilarious.
that is so funny. - That is so funny.
Oh! I...

okay.
harsh.
well, come on, Ian.
you know what? I'm good. I'm just gonna...
Ian, come on, baby. Don't be shy.
no, thanks. It looks like you got your hands full there, so...
sure you don't want to get in on this, bro?
no, thanks, man.
it looks like you fellows got it all under control.
so I'm just gonna skedaddle. You all take care now.
Lindsay, say hi to your mom.
all right. See you later, buddy.
Ian. Dude, where you going?
shit.
Hey, Goldie, scoot over.
Hey, babe, you wanna party? - I'm at a party.
you should pee on us.
why don't you take a picture, Ian?
Yeah, and post it on Totalfuckingawesomeness. com.
Backslash-we-rule!
Where'd you come up with that?
Hey, can I ask you guys a question? - You just did.
can I ask you another question? - You just did again.
what's up? What's up? - What's up, what's up?
nice hair. It'll look even better in my crotch.
dude, where you going? - Come on.
what's going on? Something troubling you? Be a buddy.
I'm... All right, all right. - You got to get over the monkey.
where do you guys get the confidence to, like, hit on every girl you see?
cause we're the shit. - Yeah, you oughts to know that, bitch.
so where's Felicia? - Fel-ate-cha. Yeah.
she's in... - Fe-lay-cha! You banging her?
we're just friends.
I'm uncircumcised. - Yeah.
I'm into you and I'm hard. - Yeah.
Hey, I was born to fertilize. - Yeah.
I'm a firefighter. - Fuck off!
wait, I thought you took her to prom.
Yeah, but it was a just-friends kind of thing.
you should bang her. We would.
dude, we would bang her so hard.
we would take that ass and just...
Yeah, tell her we'll bang her for you if you're not into it.
Yeah. Hard.
with our dicks! - Yeah, our dicks are huge.
you could see them from space! What's up?
what's up? - Hey, do you have a phone number?
you don't. Okay.
I'll call you from nationals.
say it. - You're my little donut girl.
Bye, sexy. - Yo, Ian.
you want to smell my finger? - Yeah, okay.
are you sure you got the right hole?
kids.
awesome.
Hmm... '69.
whoa.
don't puss out. Be cool.
I don't know.
that is a long drive, my sugar biscuit!
sugar biscuit? God, I suck at this.
holy buckets.
she wants me to give her the D.
love beef.
Terry, phone call.
dude, weren't you in my gym class? What is it? Egan?
Yeah, yeah. Hey, Jordan.
right. Whatever, scrotch. You can't get your fist pregnant.
Russ, man, check it out. Yo, look who's buying jimmys.
you want these gift-wrapped, Egan?
just ring it up, man.
Karen, let me have that for you.
dad, what did you do with my helmet?
Ian, honey, I made you some tollhouse cookies.
I'll just leave these here for you.
I'll get them later.
there's $40 in the cow for fun money, so be safe and sorry I didn't knock.
anytime. It's your home now.
Oh, dear.
dude. - Hey.
what is going on with you? You bought rubbers?
how did you know that? - It's on Russ Miller's blog.
Jesus! That was, like, 11 minutes ago.
what's the deal? Dude.
she wants me to meet her tonight at the Big Boy in Knoxville.
this is a fucking written invitation to your dick from the Internet.
Oh, Jesus.
seriously, dude, pack your shit. We're going to Knoxville.
no. Stop it. Put these back.
this is the type of girl who has...
she has it shaved into a landing strip.
I can't deal with a landing strip.
okay, dude, you don't know that. I mean, she could have anything under there.
there could be a little Hitler or just a full, nasty Chewbacca.
but I'm guessing this chick is baby fresh.
you know, she doesn't even want me. She wants him.
I'm sorry. This is good. This is fine.
I mean, that looks like you. Like the eyes.
Tasty's probably a guy, anyway.
maybe. But what if she's not?
you know, I mean, look, you've already opened, and I could help you close.
we just need one thing.
Ian, just look at this. I mean, you roll up in a '69 GTO, she's gonna drop an egg right there in the Big Boy parking lot.
Hey, Ian, come give me a hand with this.
here. Strap that end down. Tight.
the cord's too short. - Put a little sack into it, powder puff.
all right. Thanks, little brother. - Yeah.
Hey, Ian. - Yeah.
did I hear something about you wanting to borrow my car?
no, no, it's fine. Thanks. Thank you.
you sure?
you're my little brother, Ian. All you gotta do is ask.
okay.
could I use The Judge this weekend?
Fuck-stick, I wouldn't let you drive The Judge if it was parked on my shnuts.
let's go, Dad. - What a dick.
you should take his car just on principle.
what do you want me to do, you know?
I mean, I doubt I can hot-wire it, since I don't even know what that means.
what are you doing?
no. Lance, no! Put it back. Did you just hear him? Please.
come here, we're gonna have a talk.
she's only nine short hours away, okay?
we're gonna head down there tonight and you're gonna put a dent in that shit.
Ian's gonna treat it like it's meat that needs tenderizing.
with his dick instead of a hammer.
you can pound it till it bleeds.
Yeah, it's just a fucking girl's mess, and then we're gonna be...
What're you doing? - Still rolling.
who's gonna pound on it? Say it. Ian's gonna pound on it.
we're back tomorrow before Rex even knows the car is gone.
now, listen, these girls at Madison are gonna be fucking at a college level.
I need you ready for that.
wait! Put it... Put it back.
back here.
for God's sake. You two rump rangers couldn't wait five minutes?
shit.
shit! - Fuck!
I told her she could stay here this weekend.
dude, what the hell? Why are you driving Rex's car?
I thought me and...
are you bitching out on me? - No.
no. - No.
good. Well, then where are we going?
um... Knoxville, Tennessee.
okay. I'm gonna go tell my mom.
okay. Are you gonna... Awesome.
dude, what the fuck?
I don't want her along. - Really?
you don't want to bring Yoko on your sex trip?
Yeah, no shit. She's always cock-blocking you.
no, she isn't. She doesn't even have a...
okay, twat blocking.
professor.
when will you be coming back?
no, tomorrow.
when? - No. Bye! God.
you guys drive safe now. Bye!
so, what's in Tennessee?
my grandma has got some cancer.
Grammy K? - She's fine.
she's gonna live forever. Well, a long time.
it's, you know... I mean, what is it called?
it's foot cancer. - She's got a little foot cancer.
she'll be hopping around in no time.
so what's she doing in Tennessee?
Oh! Um... Well, there's this kick-ass cancer center there.
Yeah. - Yeah, it's like... It's famous.
Yeah. - So if you ever get any cancer, you should totally check it out.
I would.
so you want I-80 East and then 65 goes all the way through Indiana.
so how's it feel? - What?
I don't know, breaking the rules, talking some shit, driving The Judge?
it feels pretty good.
this dude wants to race.
let's go, ladies.
Lance! Cut it out! Come on, you don't know who's in there.
dude, I don't care if fucking Steve McQueen's zombie corpse is in that car.
I refuse to be embarrassed by a car that looks like a Trapper Keeper.
I am not racing in my brother's car.
holy shit.
what the hell is that?
looks like a Nachos BellGrande.
and a chalupa!
medium Coke!
go right!
turn the wipers on! - They are on.
they're not working!
please, don't yell at me. I'm doing the best I can.
Winnebago! - Where?
Winnebago! Winnebago!
Oh, my God, are you all right?
Yeah, nobody offer to help. I got this under control.
are you all right? - Do I look like I'm all right? Fuck!
you know what might make you feel better? Putting 40 on pump two.
Hey. You okay in there?
God damn! My back teeth are snorkeling.
sweet relief.
you got the shy bladder?
Yeah. - Damn.
Paruresis. That's what they call it.
let me tell you something. I didn't catch your name.
let me tell you something, Ian. I had it something fierce.
you can do it, Ian. You can do it.
go running down by your sister.
excuse me, ma'am, that was my pump.
yeah? You move your meat, you lose your seat. Hmm.
Logan, do not eat that. You will fuck up your appetite!
damn.
listen, Reba.
if you value the rest of your teeth, you will shut off that pump.
so I tells my daddy, "You know what? You're not the boss of me.
not you, not Angie," that's that girl I was telling you about.
and sure as hell not this bladder of mine.
well, he looked at me, and you should have...
Ian. Where you going? Don't give up.
Jesus. I've been pissing for an hour.
another one for the collection. - Cool. Thanks.
what?
it's okay, Brandy. It's okay, baby, don't cry.
Lance, what are you doing?
dude, you should be ashamed of yourself, because I'm just trying to show another human being a little compassion.
and my dick.
it's okay, baby. Just let those tears fall.
you know why? 'Cause our love will dry them up.
love will keep us alive. Just like that song. You know that song?
that's our song now. That song represents our bond.
don Henley's words represent our love.
what have you got?
Hey, kid, where you from?
I'm from Chicago, I mean, outside Chicago. - Are you two married. No?
no, we're just friends. We're amigos. - You make a good couple.
she's pretty. Marry that girl.
see my lady and I here, we've been married forever.
and I tell you she was gorgeous.
the first day I saw her, I said, "This is gonna be my wife.
and you know what? It happened.
I tell you, that was a very good year for corn.
made lots of money.
I fixed my 4X4 and bought my lady a sexy French lingerie.
boy, those were the best six bucks I ever spent.
you kids want to help yourself to a can of Purple?
purple sounds great, Ian. Purple? - Yeah, I can go...
say, the boys still hanging?
you ever had a peppermint fatty? - No. Let's have that.
see how that shoe fits.
Oh, my God. Do you have a degree in this?
you know that thing, when runners say they break the wall?
you know, and it's all good after that?
I feel like that when my dick's in your mouth.
it actually says Purple Soda.
bad boy.
you like him, don't you?
what? Who? - Lance. I mean, he's the crush, right?
Oh, yeah! I like Lance, 'cause he's so hot.
I wanna have his baby, he's... Whatever.
brandy! - Uh-oh!
brandy! Shit.
Howdy. - Howdy.
Mr. McBroom. Ma'am. Where the fuck's Brandy at?
you ever hear of a rolling brown-out? - No. Let's try it.
you bleach that.
wait. No, no, no, no! Nothing brown! Nothing brown! Nothing brown!
What're you gonna do? Hit a girl?
no, but I'm gonna pummel his ass real good.
there you go. There you go.
Hey!
I have to go to church.
come on, baby! Open the goddamn door!
all right, this is not what it looks like. It was a project for school.
purple Soda!
wiener!
Ow!
there you are.
come on, come on. I do not want to die naked.
fuck you! Motherfucking son of a bitch!
get on your feet, you motherfucking pussy!
I'm gonna ask you this just one time. Did she give you the nugget?
Hey, hold on!
come on, man, she's not worth it.
she's just gonna shit all over you. Trust me.
she touch your butthole? - No, no. Jesus, no!
let's see! - I thought she was a man. I'm gay.
I'm gay as hell.
eat bat, dickhead!
holy shit!
Ian just killed that guy.
sir? Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?
look, I have my insurance card. I'm sorry. We're from out of town.
I couldn't see you through the corn. I'm sorry.
where the hell's the road? - It feels like left.
I told you we didn't have time for this, - but all you care about is your stupid dick. - Ian.
and you leave us out there with her mom's weird soda.
Ian. - And her dad's balls in plain view...
Ian, Ian, whip a shitty!
holy fucking shit! That's how you do that!
Oh, my God, Ian, amazing driving. Lance, you suck!
where the hell are we? - Where are the Google maps?
they're in my pants. - Which are?
in the trailer.
Mmm-hmm. Great.
shit. I got gum in my bush.
Hey, pick this guy up. Maybe he can show us back to the highway.
Ian, do not pick up a hitchhiker. - Don't worry, I won't.
no, no, no.
Oh, my God.
Hey! Thanks for the lift, man. I've been out there for hours.
not one car. Can you believe it?
listen, sir, we didn't... - You're good people.
guy, you're not wearing any pants. - Yeah, I know.
right on.
let's go. We better go.
Hey, you got my stuff.
Hey, real quick, guys, what's the story of the girl?
I'm 25 years old. - I don't know what he's talking about.
I got nothing. There's no bars. You know, it probably just needs water.
got any in the trunk?
Hey, sweetheart, men are talking. We got this one.
Yeah, thanks, but this happened to my brother's car once - and you just piss in the radiator. - Really?
Yeah.
Oh, God! Damn it!
are you okay? - Fuck. Yeah.
that's a lesson learned.
you can watch, if you're into that kind of thing.
wow, thanks, but I think we've all seen your dick enough for one day.
do you hear that? There's a ringing. - Your loss. It's like razor blades.
what? There's ants down here. FYI.
all right, you're up. Grip it and rip it.
okay. Go away.
dude, seriously? Still? I thought you got over this shit.
you're a grown man.
flowing river, gentle stream. Flowing river, gentle stream.
yo, stage fright, how're we doing? - Damn it, Lance, just give me a minute.
excuse me. We kind of need you to pee in the radiator.
Why? - We just do.
I'm sorry. I just took a squirt a couple of minutes ago.
you want me to shit in it?
we'll get back to you on that one. - All right.
I'm telling you, I could shit right now. - Awesome.
our new friend's got nothing left in the tank.
what?
no. Guys, come on. I don't have the aim that you do.
every drop helps so much.
Hey, look what I found in my bag.
thank God.
No! - What the fuck are you doing?
you all just wait 20 minutes and I'll top it off for you.
could be ten.
fine, fine. Okay. But if any of you pervs peek,
I swear to God it will be your last conscious act.
shit.
you kids need some help?
Hi.
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great. I just beaved a family of four.
try it.
all set?
look, I'm sorry, sir, but we can't give you a ride.
I'm gonna say this once.
you unlock this fucking car, or God is my witness,
I'll stake you all to the ground, cut you open and let the dogs get at you.
Oh, yeah?
Bye-bye.
shit, shit, shit, shit.
what happened? - It's stuck.
Uh-oh.
that didn't work out like you planned, did it?
you know what? Mostly I'm disappointed. It shows zero character.
I know, I'm sorry.
and you're a dick.
you're a dick. You know what, ma'am? You're a dick, too.
here's that pee you ordered. - Roll them up.
there you go, Tex. - You're soaked with pee.
quick car wash?
God! - Gross.
it smells like beef jerky. You know?
it's just got like that sour sweetness.
how can nobody go down a road for an hour and a half?
why did they even make this stupid road?
it's so hot out here.
Ow!
Oh, my God, your head. Wait... Does it hurt? Let me see.
Yes. It hurts.
what is that? - Oh, my God.
Wow.
that is so beautiful.
need some help?
Yeah, but no offense... - Right, 'cause I'm Amish, so I wouldn't know anything about your '69 GTO Judge.
455 Big Block, Ram Air. 4-11 posi, something like that.
weird, that thing must have fallen straight from space.
well, good luck with the future ride, spaceman.
Hey, dude, wait up. Hold on.
Wow!
okay.
what are you doing? Whoa, whoa. No, no, no. Leesh, that's a bad idea.
what? - Come on.
you don't know how far we have to walk. Those are your only pair of shoes.
you know what? You're probably right. God, you're so sensible.
but maybe I should? Or maybe I shouldn't?
I should.
I can't believe you just did that.
so he met this chick on the Internet, which is sketchy.
the Internet?
Yeah, it's like a series of computers that are connected through...
computers?
a computer is like a big calculator, you know, with the screen.
I'm just busting your balls, man. I know what the Internet is.
okay. - You ever heard of Rumspringa?
Yeah, that ska band from Delaware.
no, it means "run wild." It's an Amish tradition where when we turn 16, we can go live like you heathens for a while.
you go nuts, party for months or years till your folks start hassling you, and then it's back to the Stone Age.
but if you're on Rumspringa, what's with the buggy?
Oh, no. I'm not. Not anymore.
I probably shouldn't even be talking to you but...
I'm a little bit of an Amish floutlaw.
sometimes I just miss the world. - What do you miss the most?
you know, I miss sarcasm. It's mostly lost on my people.
Oh.
and gambling. Went to Vegas once. And buttfucking.
have a lot of nice memories there.
I hear that. - Oh, yeah.
buttfucking.
wait, are we talking about dudes?
no. - Okay. Then yeah.
I mean, unless that's what you're into, and then, whatever.
it's not. - No?
no.
not into dudes. - No, no, no, no, no.
how old are you? - Old enough.
how old are you?
this is gonna happen.
it's gonna happen whether you fight it or not.
so I kind of want you to fight it.
cut.
all right. Now you. - No way. Forget it.
dude, you never do anything crazy. Ever.
Hey! I'm driving halfway across the country to go to...
to visit your grandma? Whoa!
so anyway, we're there and she's like...
Oh, yeah.
like, she won't stop crying.
that's the funniest thing, too. - I know.
I know, I was with this stripper in Vegas, and I was like, "you want this?
so she's like, "Yeah, I want it, I want it.
and I was like, yeah, this gets hotter by the second.
What're you crying about?" She's like, ..."wanted to be a doctor.
and I'm like, "Yeah, you're a fucking Ph. D. of cock.
Yeah. - Yeah, exactly.
and then coercing my load out on to the crying face.
Vegas in general is just... Good times.
you can get a blowjob for $10.
or for free if you meet the right girl and tell her "I'm on Rumspringa.
what is this blowjob that you speak of?
your techno music beguiles me.
let me put it in your butt.
you know, when you cut your foot on a piece of glass, - don't think I'm gonna carry you. - You know what? I will be fine. Okay?
I was born barefoot. - Hey! Wait!
Hey! Stop!
have a nice walk, shit-birds.
Oh!
Hey, Ian Felicia, this is my boy, Ezekiel.
what up, English?
there's no service out here.
I can't even tell her I'll be late. - Good. That's perfect. Keep her waiting.
you don't want to come off as desperate.
I'm driving nine hours. How am I not coming off desperate?
we had shit to do. - Uh-oh! See that creamy stuff?
you blew your head gasket. That's not good.
shit. - Don't cry. We can fix it.
Really? - Yeah, really. We're good at it.
yeah? - Yeah. I didn't mean to undersell it, but it's an impressive thing.
Yeah. We'll fix it. - Wow, that'd be cool.
Yeah, would be cool, wouldn't it? I might be the coolest guy you ever met.
Wow. - Wow.
thank you. - Yeah. You're welcome.
that's what you say when people do nice things for you.
you know, there's a pretty big shindig shaping up next door if you guys want to hang there while we work on it.
take it easy while we do all this for you.
does he have an attitude? - No, he's fucking with you.

I think I saw Aram just now.
so many years, he appears finally.
won't you still care about him?
don't care about he is alive or dead?
for me, he has been dead for a long time.

for me, I can talk until tomorrow.
he have take a very bad mistake.
he actually did this crazy thing successfully
it's his mother's fault for spoiling him.
it's too much.
at that time, you mother was sick
but she still remember the guy who has hided.
he went to the war in Caucasia
he was already dead.
you will never see him.
if he come back one day.
what I can see is his body.
Roy told me

calm down.
those Kurd believe in Talaat. And do things for him.
they did that thing together.
I got the information from the Iraqi. They also did many things for the Turkish.
do you hear me, Aram?
I'm listening, Kavedjian
I got it.
there are changes in the Armenian
the Kurd are much easier to be bought over.
they will call at once when new goods come.
they believe that doing like that make their organization safe.
and will protect him.
turkish make use of them
new comrades.
fullfill their demands.
the Caucasian Council were shocked by the death of your friends.
they want me to inform you to leave.
go back to explain that and go to the front-line they want that nothing happens before all the negotiatings.
and they said they don't need those weapons any more
understand?
that is formerly what we must get.
Aslin, What did Fanzinler say?
he thought it an accident.
before you leave, don't do anything for revenge.
for you, it is a pity.

the same day, but the method was changed. Wait for his arrangement
in one day or two he will inform me.
you can call me every morning to ask me.
this is all?

just for safety.
we will promise your safety when back

you all don't know
their common point is to being cherished by their owner
children and family like dog

I'm looking a true man for you
are you?
I said for example
I have been silent for 4 days
Why?

maybe yes
common ground between two people doesn't mean sex

are you the same age?
no
you are really strange
it's no use arguing

if have love, no need guarantee
will Diana be happy?
if he grasps you, he will loss interest
believe your heart
till now, can't you abandon the graceful life?
when he is not in
can you stay at the small home?
the most important thing is love
do you still love him?
it's enough

not only is the god is scary.
the motorbike drivers here are pain in the ass.
cruel.
they like to grab asses.
aren't you afraid?
we are.
then give me the incense.
what are you using it for?
I forget to bring mine.
shit. Shamelessly ask for it, huh?
people come here praying for stuff every day.
how the god manages to bless all of them?
you think so, Wan?
you're pretty talkative.
winning a big lotto and getting my dream girl.
and we promised to return the offering if our prayers are answered.
Ake.
the holy banyan god.
the tree is getting bigger and bigger.
you think so?
where the hell are they?
wait for me!
why don't you wait me up?
what for?
it's raining.
Wow. Rain is coming.
what exactly did you ask for, Don?
what else could this horse-face ask for... except a wife?
your face would stop a clock.
are you riding motorbike-taxi?
Yeah. At this alley.
reasonable fare I offer.
and where is your bike?
where is your bike?
stop being so curious. That's annoying!
my motorcycle was seized.
that's why I come here to ask the god.
think about it.
I've already paid for 20 installments.
only 12 installments that I missed.
and they took my bike from me. Is it fair?
is it really fair?
bro.
what's your name?
Kwai.
who would names himself "Kwai," the buffalo?
I'll kick your ass, you bastard.
have you ever heard the buffalo story?
I'll tell you.
have you ever heard the saying that...
farmers are the spine of the nation.
thailand will be prosperous from the agriculture.
it is getting too long.
the life of... It's too long.
I'll make a long story short then.
bring it out
Buffalo is an animal.
is that short enough, bastard.
never played with rain before?
it's raining hard.
look! Who's that?
doggy, doggy!
that's Grandma Chuern.
she is not really all there.
being retarded, I mean.
what did she do to become like that?
well, it's a long story.
I don't wanna talk about it.
then don't do it.
what? Don't you wanna know?
she had a dog.
that dog pissed over the shrine of the god.
and it was found dead in the morning.
she was angry and wanted to tore down the shrine.
on the next day she became like this.
well, just forget it.
how are you gonna go home?
better wait until the rain stops.
doggy. Where have you been?
let's go home What?!
I miss you so much. Let's go! Hungry?
I'll cook for you, okay?
let me go. I ate already.
let's go home. I'll make food for you. Auntie!
you have quite a few doggy friends.
doggy! Let me go! Grandma, go back home.
come on! Welcome! Welcome!

Hey! Would join me in the booze?
I'm not going. Go!
same Pub.
same Pub.
Cheers!
bottom up!
where is Don? I haven't seen him around.
I haven't seen him since the evening.
when will the light be back?
these damn mosquitoes are killing me.
stop whining. The power is back soon.
move over.
take it away from me.
mosquito. What mosquito?
meatball, meatball.
the atmosphere like this...
is perfect for spooky stories.
want to hear a real story?
the grand-grandpa used to say that before it is a Banyan tree standing there.
he said...
this soul belongs to a solder...
a power-mad general...
who had done great, heroic killing people like tiny animals.
so he was tragically assasinated making him full of wrath and hatred...
until today...
moreover, they told that this soul has a spectral power.
everyone starts idolizing it.
what about the one who died and became a Banyan ghost?
yeah...
the one who died with wrath and could not be reborn.
seem he's waiting for someone.
who is that?
madam Ting.
he is a fortune teller and a spirit medium.
been here for two months.
let's do another toss!
let him.
again? Y eah.
still have some left. That's it.
Ake.
Ake.
I'll kill you...
Ake.
Ake.
don...
don!
don is still not up yet.
what do you want from him?
why don't you buy me some Chinese buns?
you don't know what your friends think indeed.
what do you think about Bell and Don?
nothing much as far as I see.
the best he can do is grabbing her hand.
just staring into her eyes!
grabbing hand!
eye staring. Hand grabbing.
Whoa! Who's that?
that's awesome!
what the fuck is awesome?
don't tell me that you two...
are mistaking me with Bruce Bullshit.
it's Willis!
Wow!
that means...
I'll tell you what happened.
I won the three-number jackpot!
and how about you guys?
we all passed the Entrance exams.
Really?
see? I told you the Banyan god is sacred.
and where are you heading to?
t o buy stuff to make an offering.
making an offering!
that's perfect. I haven't done it either.
come on, please! Get on!
hurry up! You are the first to sit on it.
go a little further.
shoot! A little further.
more!
I told you to move outward not inward.
that is quite a crotch-cobra!
your dad love you so much. He gives you a lot.
you all did get through the Entrance, huh? Y eah.
I met Mork at the Karaoke. She's pretty.
isn't he a man?
Mork is a friend of Ooy's.
Mork sits next to Ooy.
Mork and Urm is nothing but Mork and Ooy is something.
you're so dirty.
dirty about what?
Hey! Stop!
make three steps backward.
what's wrong?
this place is quite familiar.
I don't think my memory is wrong.
I can even recognize the leaves.
Oh Fuck!
the Banyan tree is gone!
I guess we entered a wrong alley.
cause seasons change frequently here.
and more importantly,
the shrine we've been looking for...
...has already disappeared.
keep it up. We're about to laugh now.
why don't you cooperate with me? Just a bit. We almost get it.
hey you! Can I ask you something?
Oh... Oh... You... you... are... are... going...
we come make an offering.
what? You co-m-e-come too late.
who paid for us?
the M-M-Metropolis has taken it away.
how come?
don't you know...
they're constructing a road for cars to run.
Oh, a new road. Y eah.
cut the tree to make a road.
but that tractor got burned up and the driver was dead.
the Banyan god must be angry.
listen. The god is not here anymore.
you all...
the god has got a-an-angry.
the god has got ankle.
Oh-oh!
have fun with your laugh.
the god will surely get back to you.
the god must be very angry.
the god is angry.
how could you still laughing? You...
do we look like we're laughing?
you all must die.
I wanna go to Pitsanuloke.
die! You all must die!
the god must be quite upset now.
Ah! I'm just kidding!
let's eat. It's still warm.
I stir fried it myself.
who is ringing the doorbell at this late?
Oh, you all are sleeping.
such a pig!
go... You two... go to...
what the fuck!
what?
is something wrong?
nothing.
Hey!!
don! Are you all right?
what is it?
let's go, Bell.
are you sure this is a shortcut?
I think we lost.
bag it! You know how long I have been a rider?
the word "lost" is not in my dictionary.
Wow! You are so cool, man!
come on! I'll take you.
hey Mo!
huh?
do you see what I see?
hello. Excuse me, Please.
excuse me, miss.
this late at night...
where are you heading to?
to the end of the market.
what a coincidence!
I'm about to pass that way, too.
do you mind joining me for a ride?
you have someone riding with.
don't worry, miss.
this kid is just my servant.
I've just flown back from aboard. I'm a rich man in disguise.
Mo. Yes, sir
what?
getting off? Yeah. Do it!
shit! You buffalo, man.
that's it. Please get on the bike.
move in a little bit. Don't worry.
catch hold of my waist before you fall out.
hold it to my heart. Both hands tightly, okay?
Vroom! To the left! Vroom!
brake! There's a car coming!
oops! I forgot to start the engine.
Oh, Mother of God!
everything seems perfect...
...except one thing.
this stupid noise of a xylophone really ruins the atmosphere.
who the hell is dead today?
do you work at Sukiyaki restaurant?
y es.
I like eating Sukiyaki.
I like to eat dim sum.
and because I'm something.
oops! My cock...
kwai feels the booty call.
how about you? Are you home alone?
are you coming to live with me?
I have to ask for a permission from my parents.
including my royal grandparents.
if they will allow me.
since I liked to escape from the palace.
but it'd be difficult.
getting farther and farther.
I think it is getting quite bizarre.
that's not bizarre.
this is...
...what you should call bizarre.
Damn!
it's blackout again.
you don't remember, do you?
Wan!!
nurse, is my friend all right?
the doctor said that he'll be home in a few days.
all visitors should wait outside.
give me a hand.
did Wan get an electric shock?
I forgot to ask.
what happened with your leg? A bike accident?
want me to Molly whop you?
don't say "bike accident" to me.
you know how long I've been riding a motorcycle?
the speed of 200 with no hands no legs. I did it all.
then you got spooked by a ghost. Right?
this cutie is right.
come get my reward.
I'll kiss your cheek.
I'm just kidding.
about my leg, here is what happened.
I think it is getting quite bizarre.
that's not bizarre.
this is...
...what you should call bizarre.
Oh Fuck!
I'm fucking scared.
I'm fucking scared.
I'm scared.
Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm scared!!
I'm not flirt. I'm not cool.
I'm just a stupid Kwai.
I give up.
I'm scared.
my leg?
my leg!
my leg is broken!
let's make it clear.
since we went to the Banyan god shrine...
we have been followed by something.
absolutely right!
you'd made a prayer but didn't return the offerings.
he's now calling upon you.
who is it?
holy cow! Look!
what a posture!
look at his outfit. Your house must be freezing.
why are you up there? Get down here.
and stop making such a lemon face.
stupid putz!
who is that?
come on, Bell.
Oh Fuck!
bell? Is that you?
Hey! What are you doing to me?
I haven't done anything.
why are you excited?
it's not time to get horny.
this is me. Go back to sleep.
bell.
Hmm... stinky smell.
I'm out of here.
nobody is waiting for me.
here... I come
it is crawling near...
what the heck are you playing?
the crab crawling... Look at the crab crawling.
my legs can't move. No one tells me.
not telling me a word.
I'm out of here.
again?
Oh damn!
let me go! Somebody help me!
Hey! Help me!
Kwai, fight her back!
fight her back. Kwai. You can do it.
let me go.
follow me every damn day!
you know I'm scared.
always turning tail and run.
always turning tail and run.
come on! Let's call spade a spade.
straight from the shoulder.
come on!
your move looks like a stupid goose flying.
come closer.
that's too close.
come on. Bring it on.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
what do you want from me?
what a butterface!
you're not my type. Why don't you follow those guys?
more handsome hunks are down there. I'm not for you.
cracked bitch!
that's wickedly sinful.
unacceptable.
I can't take it.
scaring the shit out of me like this...
a green face like that is not my type.
you wanna leave peacefully...
or you wanna be sent the hard way...
...with my pants taking off...
if you still don't get away I'll take my pants off.
you'll see a spooky thing inside.
here. Here.
see?
she's scared, huh?
if you don't learn a lesson.
I'll beat you with this one-eyed trouser trout.
that serves you right!
where the hell are you all?
where are you?
y es, doctor. Thank you.
what did he say?
he suggested that we take him to a psychiatrist.
Why?
he hollers all over the hospital.
babble about some weird thing.
we'd better find a way to return the offering.
I'm starting to worry about him.
the Banyan tree from Sukati alley has been sent to the sawmill.
do you have the number?
number? Just a second.
the phone number, right?
Mo, jot it down.
there is no vacancy for workers.
W ait. We're not here for jobs.
I need your help.
trouble? Oh no!
take it easy. It's not what you think.
we're looking for... uh... well...
is the owner of the sawmill here?
I am the owner of Lim Ha Chiang.
how do you do? Well, we...
just say what you want.
we're looking for the Banyan tree...
...that is just sent to your sawmill.
there is no Banyan tree here.
we have only boards.
and planks.
and in the future...
we'll have a golf club too.
kidding!
anyway, could you allow us to look around?
and I'll buy all of these. Please.
please help us, sir.
you're buying all of these, right?
there are many kinds of wood. Pick what you like.
has any strange things happened here recently?
strange thing...
the wood...
have you ever heard of... the living wood?
Damn! I can't even say anything, can I?
this fucking wood looks ugly.
Oh, I can't curse you anything huh? Bastard.
bastard!
you brick!
bastard!
Oh, It's reacting back.
son of a bi-bi-bi... beautiful!
Damn! I can't touch anything.
is that wood still here?
no. It's sold out.
to a big customer.
do you want anything else?
no thanks... May we also be excused now?
do we have more banyan wood coffins?
no. This is the last one we have.
and it's already sold out.
be careful. All right.
get cracking!
shoot! It was bought. What should we do?
you think if we ask them to change to other coffin
what will they say?
Wan! Yummy omelet!
I made it myself.
Wan.
are you all right?
what the hell?
not be here...
it's heavy.
hey... careful!
it's not too late. We can get it done quickly.
is this not fucking late?
come on!
ready?
new wood and new corpse.
that's your cheap shot.
hurry up! These mosquitoes are killing me.
Mo. Come on! That's it.
fucking stink!
why let go so quickly?
come on, Ake.
catch it!
when are they gonna come?
it's weird.
hey Kwai! Why are you doing here?
what took you so long?
I can't be alone. There's something up there.
all right. You go prepare the stuff.
I'll check it out.
I'm serious.
hey Ake!
Hey!
try to remember the words you uttered on that day.
you must fulfill whatever you promised.
otherwise...
all of your efforts will be in vain.
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.
the misfortune is over.
we're even now.
Wan, I'm kind of curious...
when you're in that room did you remember anything?
it's like a dream.
it took me to the past... long time ago.
there're soldiers wearing rather old uniforms marching all over the place.
if I move the troop out but you can't get out...
it means we're at a disadvantage.
I'm not trying to fan the flame.
we must reach a mutual agreement.
if we can't move our troops to each strategic areas
the opponent might backfire us with their attack.
I have drafted the announcement.
this will be our vow for the unity among all of us.
through our dignity, we promise that we won't leave anyone behind.
we're willing to die together.
your telegram, sir.
and then...
I can't remember what happens.
Damn! I'm about in a mood.
all right.
since we have come this far.
hold on! Stop your bullshit.
stop sipping that beer.
a kid like you not to drink beer.
you've just ask me for a toss.
well, the past is with the past.
I'll take care of the rest.
I think we've got a problem.
what's wrong?
my finger got stuck in a bottle.
I can't take it out.
it stuck!
how did it get in there?
what?
you're deep shit.
I'm fucked!
I told you not to pick it up... Then I...
now I gotta drain my dragon.
what should I do?
how am I gonna pee...
with this shit on?
use a stick to support your ding-dong.
my foot is hurt. How am I gonna pee?
let's hide.
sit down.
that's Kwai.
y eah, right.
do a prank on him.
how?
he is coming. Let's hide.
surprise!
what's going on?
you've just been possessed.
possessed? That ghost doesn't go anywhere.
it's still around here.
hiding in one of you.
it's still around here...
because of the incense powder, right?
I think we should open a way for him to get out.
do you think I'm joking to you?
Hey! Close the circle!
don't worry. I can prove it.
whoever keeps this in your mouth he will be safe.
let me the first one to prove.
boy! The tongue move.
making sound. Very fit.
who's next?
Mo. Ah, you go first.
this is not some kind of joke.
let the soul be in too long you might end up losing your body.
Mo... go ahead!
I'll be next then.
at least I'm not the last one.
very smooth, aren't you?
Mo!
me? Yeah.
come on, Mo.
Yuck!
madam, your fetish must already be dead!
Eww! It stinks too.
Kwai... what should I do, man?
this thing is sucked twice already.
aren't you feel sorry for him?
how about a helping hand?
t ake a pick.
no. I choose this one.
W an!
hey...
wan
Wan!!!
madam. You broke the vow. I'll kill you.
madam.
you broke the vow. I'll kill you.
what are you talking about?
we did return you the offering.
I want your life.
what? We've given the offerings.
what else do you want from me?
I want your life! I want your life!
madam... what is going on here?
that means you did not complete the ritual.
there must be something wrong
or the wood that you brought...
...was not...
who did you ask about the wood?
that guy. We met him the other day.
I remember him.
Damn! That jerk again?
he is my worker.
I'm sorry.
he is kind of a dim bulb.
about the banyan tree that you've been looking for it was sent to a toothpick factory...
...around the Farmer Market.
go check it out.
do you have toothpicks made from Banyan tree?
I don't sell those of a low-grade wood.
only high-grade are for sale here.
here. This one.
we call it Maple wood.
do you know where it from?
it's from Holland.
do you know Ruud V an Nistelrooy?
fuck!
fuck!
kids these days...
like to curse 'fuck and fuck'. What's a big deal about fuck?
fuck you!
fuck!
moron!
it's not gonna work.
what the fuck are you looking at?
what the fuck are you looking at?
what did you say?
nothing, bro. May I have the toothpick in your...
what do you want?
that toothpick in your mouth.
Why? There are many more toothpicks.
yean, but... What? What the fuck do you want it for?
I have the whole new pack for you here.
what do you want it for? Really want it? Y es.
you want it, right? Please... I beg you.
okay. Go get it.
fuck! It's burned!
what the fuck is wrong with him?
if the holy god really exists...
please help us find the Banyan tree soon.
Amen!
a noodle seller and a Hainan-chicken seller are fighting for some kind of a fetish that is believed to bring good luck...
that thing is a toothpick.
don't push me. It's my toothpick, Chief.
have a seat and take it easy.
don't you understand Thai?
it's my toothpick.
that's mine! What do you want?
don't bullshit.
you stole my toothpick!
No! You stole my toothpick.
officer, clear this up for me.
lieutenant... reporters are here for the toothpick case.
all right. Let him in.
good evening. This way, please.
the non-sense news always sells, doesn't it?
what do you wanna know?
can I have a look at that toothpick?
Sarge, bring the toothpick in.
watch out! It's haunted, you know?
is it gonna be on the headline?
a toothpick ghost.
what's a big deal about it?
just a piece of an ordinary toothpick
how could a ghost be in it?
I'm going to the restroom.
I forgot to tell you that I just use it.
what a stupid lieutenant you are!
lieutenant!
lieutenant! Lieutenant!
lieutenant! Lieutenant!
lieutenant!
Damn!
anybody!
where is everyone?
Hey! Get somebody here...
where are they? Lieutenant!
what's up?
bell, where is Wan?
in his room.
ake, did you get the toothpick? Yes.
go get Madam Ting.
he is not here anymore.
uncle Ling already flew the coop...
nobody is here.
what do you mean?
they all ran away?
I can't wait anymore.
Kwai, hold this.
you traitor didn't keep your promise.
isn't it a bit too late?
I'm so sorry that we return you the offering so late.
I don't want your apology. I want your friend's life.
he betrayed me...
why do you have to do this?
we've tried to find a piece of banyan tree.
please. I beg you. Give it to me.
all we want is taking our friend back.
it's not about you anymore.
or the opponent has known about our strategy.
then... you go ahead with the plan.
I'll take care of this point.
you gotta put them off.
there's a bridge about 500 meters from here.
let's meet over there.
do you think it's all about the votive prayer you gave me?
that's not it.
you can't remember, right?
document!
sir!
did you betray us?
the situation is changed.
or else we would become a rebel.
why do you have to be so harsh?
he is my friend!
do you have a fucking idea.
how long I've been waiting for you two.
I'm sorry.
it's my fault. Punish me...
so I can wash away my guilt.
kill me if it can release you from the hatred.
and your soul can be reborn.
but I'll be back to kill you in the next life.
you want it to be never-ended?
you don't want me to be enraged?
you deserted me...
when I think you all are my friends.
it's my fault that I can't help you.
you think we're happy about that?
think we're so happy all these times?
why do you have to be so harsh?
he is my friend!
we gotta find a scapegoat.
we promised that we won't abandon one another.
willing to die together.
after that day...
it's like we've passed a tough chapter of our life.
that made me understand the meaning of ' promise'.
and would never forget.
about Wan...
he himself didn't know what had happened.
and nobody had mentioned about it.
for Bell... After that day we didn't see her ever again.
Wow! This much better than beer
if I knew about it earlier. I'll never drink anything else.
it's strange. When we're gather here...
I'm thinking of Kwai.
speaking about him we haven't met him for a long time.
Kwai!
Oh, you ruined my image.
I've changed my name, you know?
Kally What?
Kally.
what?
Kally.
K-A-L-L and Y with a low tone.
honey, pronounce it.
Ahem. Kal-ly.
your tongue. Kal. Kal. I told you use your tongue.
Kal... Kal
kal
you're a funny girl.
kwai What?
your new bike? Very nice!
where did you get the money from?
I won a three-number j ackpot!
I asked it from the god.
the rain tree god.
the one next to the banyan tree.
didn't remember, huh?
I won the lotto so I got both bike and babe.
Hey, I never forget about you all.
I've also made a prayer for you.
you'll get bike and babe like me.
Kwai!
shopkeeper.
Shopkeeper!
may I help you?
how much is a pack of toothpick?
you wanna buy it for yourself or others?
stupid question! I buy it so I use it.
use it yourself?
y eah.
t o picking your teeth or your gum?
you crooked teeth!
filth! Asshole!
who you've just curse?
my employee. He made a loud noise. Quiet!
t en baht per pack.
t en baht each?
y es.
can it be 25 baht per 3 packs?
Oh, don't bargain it.
how about 4 packs for 50 baht?
okay.
don't use a lousy bag. Hold them in your hand it's perfectly disorderly.
sound like we'll be a good friend, huh?
I'm a kind man.
here... 60 baht... keep the change.
thank you so much.
be more careful buying things around here.
how come? Expensive!
you know how much they sell for 4 packs?
30 for four but here I sell 25 for four.
t oo expensive!
those jerks won't go far in their business.
so be careful walking in this alley.
you've made a right choice stopping by my shop.
they can't succeed in business. Y eah.
t aking advantage of customers. Unlike this shop.
have a good day, sir.
excuse me, uncle.
I'm not your mom's big brother.
excuse me, uncle.
I'm not your mom's little brother.
brother.
do I look like your mom's son?
where are you heading to?
you should get cheered up in the morning.
making yourself fresh as a daisy!
what do you guys want?
were these toothpicks made from Banyan tree?
I don't sell those of a low-grade wood.
only high-grade are for sale here.
here... this one.
we call it Maple wood.
you know where is the maple wood from?
it's from Holland.
do you know Ruud V an Nistelrooy?
he's the presenter of my product.
if you don't like it.
here. It is made from the US. The Oak wood.
its quality is second to none.
all superstars use it. Such as Brad Pitt...
arnold Schwarzenegger.
especially a singer, Britney Spears.
she usually picks her teeth before singing.
this wax is from Amazon Forest.
just rub it on your teeth all teeth will be clean!
t o get it from the Amazon is very difficult. They opened the snake mouth...
and take the stuff inside to make a wax.
hold on, guys!
I have seen these pictures since I was young.
nobody knows exactly what those people ask from a tree.
all we know is...

the atmosphere like this...
is perfect for spooky stories.
W ant to hear a real story?
the grand-grandpa used to say that before it is a Banyan tree standing there.
he said...
this soul belongs to a solder...
a power-mad general...
who had done great, heroic killing people like tiny animals.
so he was tragically assasinated making him full of wrath and hatred...
until today...
moreover, they told that this soul has a spectral power.
everyone starts idolizing it.
what about the one who died and became a Banyan ghost?
y eah...
the one who died with wrath and could not be reborn.
seem he's waiting for someone.
who is that?
madam Ting.
he is a fortune teller and a spirit medium.
been here for two months.
let's do another toss!

don is still not up yet.
what do you want from him?
why don't you buy me some Chinese buns?
you don't know what your friends think indeed.
what do you think about Bell and Don?
nothing much as far as I see.
the best he can do is grabbing her hand.
just staring into her eyes!
grabbing hand!
eye staring. Hand grabbing.
Whoa! Who's that?
that's awesome!
what the fuck is awesome?
don't tell me that you two...
are mistaking me with Bruce Bullshit.
it's Willis!
Wow!
that means...
I'll tell you what happened.
I won the three-number jackpot!
and how about you guys?
we all passed the Entrance exams.
Really?
see? I told you the Banyan god is sacred.
and where are you heading to?
t o buy stuff to make an offering.
making an offering!

come on, please! Get on!
hurry up! You are the first to sit on it.

I told you to move outward not inward.
that is quite a crotch-cobra!
your dad love you so much he gives you a lot.
you all did get through the Entrance, huh? Y eah.
I met Mork at the Karaoke. She's pretty.
isn't he a man?
Mork is a friend of Ooy's.
Mork sits next to Ooy.
Mork and Urm is nothing but Mork and Ooy...
...is something.
you're so dirty.
dirty about what?
Hey! Stop!
make three steps backward.
what's wrong?
this place is quite familiar.
I don't think my memory is wrong.
I can even recognize the leaves.
Oh Fuck!
the Banyan tree is gone!
I guess we entered a wrong alley.
cause seasons change frequently here.
and more importantly,
the shrine we've been looking for...
...has already disappeared.
keep it up. We're about to laugh now.
why don't you cooperate with me? Just a bit. We almost get it.
hey you! Can I ask you something?
Oh... Oh... You... you... are... are... going...
we come make an offering.
what? You co-m-e-come too late.
who paid for us?
the M-M-Metropolis has taken it away.
how come?
don't you know...
they're constructing a road for cars to run.
Oh, a new road. Y eah.
cut the tree to make a road.
but that tractor got burned up and the driver was dead.
the Banyan god...
...must be angry.
listen. The god is not here anymore.
you all...
the god has got a-an-angry.
the god has got ankle.
Oh-oh!
have fun with your laugh.
the god will surely get back to you.
the god must...
...be very angry.
the god is angry.
how could you still laughing? You...
do we look like we're laughing?
you all must die.
I wanna go to Pitsanuloke.
die! You all must die!
the god must be quite upset now.
Ah! I'm just kidding!
let's eat. It's still warm.
I stir fried it myself.
who is ringing the doorbell at this late?
Oh, you all are sleeping.
such a pig!
go... You two... go to...
what the fuck!
what?
is something wrong?
nothing.
Hey!!
don! Are you all right?
what is it?
let's go, Bell.
are you sure this is a shortcut?
I think we lost.

the word "lost" is not in my dictionary.
Wow! You are so cool, man!
come on! I'll take you.
hey Mo!
huh?
do you see what I see?
hello. Excuse me, Please.
excuse me, miss.
this late at night...
where are you heading to?
to the end of the market.
what a coincidence!
I'm about to pass that way too.
do you mind joining me for a ride?
you have someone riding with.

I've just flown back from aboard. I'm a rich man in disguise.
Mo. Y es, sir

Vroom! T o the left! Vroom!
brake! There's a car coming!
oops! I forgot to start the engine.
Oh, Mother of God!
everything seems perfect...
...except one thing.
this stupid noise of a xylophone...
really ruins the atmosphere.
who the hell is dead today?
do you work at Sukiyaki restaurant?
y es.
I like eating Sukiyaki.
I like to eat dim sum.
and because I'm something.
oops! My cock...
kwai feels the booty call.
how about you? Are you home alone?
are you coming to live with me?
I have to ask for a permission from my parents.
including my royal grandparents.
if they will allow me.
since I liked to escape from the palace.
but it'd be difficult.
getting farther and farther.
I think it is getting quite bizarre.
that's not bizarre.
this is...
...what you should call bizarre.
Damn!
it's blackout again.
you don't remember, do you?
Wan!!
nurse, is my friend all right?
the doctor said that he'll be home in a few days.
all visitors should wait outside.

did Wan get an electric shock?
I forgot to ask.
what happened with your leg? A bike accident?
W ant me to Molly whop you?
don't say "bike accident" to me.
you know how long I've been riding a motorcycle?
the speed of 200 with no hands no legs. I did it all.
then you got spooked by a ghost. Right?
this cutie is right.
come get my reward.
I'll kiss your cheek.
I'm just kidding.
about my leg, here is what happened.
I think it is getting quite bizarre.
that's not bizarre.

...what you should call bizarre.
Oh Fuck!
I'm fucking scared.
I'm fucking scared.
I'm scared.
Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm scared!!
I'm not flirt. I'm not cool.
I'm just a stupid Kwai.
I give up.
I'm scared.
my leg?
my leg!
my leg is broken!
let's make it clear.
since we went to the Banyan god shrine...
we have been followed by something.
absolutely right!
you'd made a prayer but didn't return the offerings.
he's now calling upon you.
who is it?
holy cow! Look!
what a posture!
look at his outfit. Your house must be freezing.
why are you up there? Get down here.
and stop making such a lemon face.
stupid putz!
who is that?
come on, Bell.
Oh Fuck!
bell? Is that you?
Hey! What are you doing to me?
I haven't done anything.
why are you excited?
it's not time to get horny.
this is me. Go back to sleep.
bell.
Hmm... stinky smell.
I'm out of here.
nobody is waiting for me.
here... I come
it is crawling near...
what the heck are you playing?
the crab crawling... Look at the crab crawling.
my legs can't move. No one tells me.
not telling me a word.
I'm out of here.
again?
Oh damn!
let me go! Somebody help me!
Hey! Help me!
Kwai, fight her back!
fight her back. Kwai. You can do it.
let me go.
follow me every damn day!
you know I'm scared.
always turning tail and run.
always turning tail and run.
come on! Let's call spade a spade.
straight from the shoulder.
come on!
your move looks like a stupid goose flying.
come closer.
that's too close.
come on. Bring it on.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
what do you want from me?
what a butterface!
you're not my type. Why don't you follow those guys?
more handsome hunks are down there. I'm not for you.
cracked bitch!
that's wickedly sinful.
unacceptable.
I can't take it.
scaring the shit out of me like this...
a green face like that is not my type.
you wanna leave peacefully...
or you wanna be sent the hard way...
...with my pants taking off...
if you still don't get away I'll take my pants off.
you'll see a spooky thing inside.
here. Here.
see?
she's scared, huh?
if you don't learn a lesson.
I'll beat you with this one-eyed trouser trout.
that serves you right!
where the hell are you all?
where are you?
y es, doctor. Thank you.
what did he say?
he suggested that we take him to a psychiatrist.
Why?
he hollers all over the hospital.
babble about some weird thing.
we'd better find a way to return the offering.
I'm starting to worry about him.
the Banyan tree from Sukati alley has been sent to the sawmill.
do you have the number?
number? Just a second.
the phone number, right?
Mo, jot it down.
there is no vacancy for workers.
W ait. We're not here for jobs.
I need your help.
trouble? Oh no!
t ake it easy. It's not what you think.
we're looking for... uh... well...
is the owner of the sawmill here?
I am the owner of Lim Ha Chiang.
how do you do? Well, we...
just say what you want.
we're looking for the Banyan tree...
...that is just sent to your sawmill.
there is no Banyan tree here.
we have only boards.
and planks.
and in the future...
we'll have a golf club too.
kidding!
anyway, could you allow us to look around?
and I'll buy all of these. Please.
please help us, sir.
you're buying all of these, right?
there are many kinds of wood. Pick what you like.
has any strange things happened here recently?
strange thing...
the wood...
have you ever heard of... the living wood?
Damn! I can't even say anything, can I?
this fucking wood looks ugly.
Oh, I can't curse you anything huh? Bastard.
bastard!
you brick!
bastard!
Oh, It's reacting back.
son of a bi-bi-bi... beautiful!
Damn! I can't touch anything.
is that wood still here?
no. It's sold out.
to a big customer.
do you want anything else?
no thanks... May we also be excused now?
do we have more banyan wood coffins?
no. This is the last one we have.
and it's already sold out.
be careful. All right.
get cracking!
shoot! It was bought. What should we do?
you think if we ask them to change to other coffin
what will they say?
W an! Y ummy omelet!
I made it myself.
W an.
are you all right?
what the hell?
not be here...
it's heavy.
hey... careful!
it's not too late. We can get it done quickly.
is this not fucking late?
come on!
ready?
new wood and new corpse.
that's your cheap shot.
hurry up! These mosquitoes are killing me.
Mo. Come on! That's it.
fucking stink!
why let go so quickly?
come on, Ake.
catch it!
when are they gonna come?
it's weird.
hey Kwai! Why are you doing here?
what took you so long?
I can't be alone. There's something up there.
all right. You go prepare the stuff.
I'll check it out.
I'm serious.
hey Ake!
Hey!
try to remember the words you uttered on that day.
you must fulfill whatever you promised.
otherwise...
all of your efforts will be in vain.
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.
the misfortune is over.
we're even now.
W an, I'm kind of curious...
when you're in that room did you remember anything?
it's like a dream.
it took me to the past... long time ago.
there're soldiers wearing rather old uniforms marching all over the place.
if I move the troop out but you can't get out...
it means we're at a disadvantage.
I'm not trying to fan the flame.
we must reach a mutual agreement.
if we can't move our troops to each strategic areas
the opponent might backfire us with their attack.
I have drafted the announcement.
this will be our vow for the unity among all of us.
through our dignity, we promise that we won't leave anyone behind.
we're willing to die together.
your telegram, sir.
and then...
I can't remember what happens.
Damn! I'm about in a mood.
all right.
since we have come this far.
hold on! Stop your bullshit.
stop sipping that beer.
a kid like you not to drink beer.
you've just ask me for a toss.
well, the past is with the past.
I'll take care of the rest.
I think we've got a problem.
what's wrong?
my finger got stuck in a bottle.
I can't take it out.
it stuck!
how did it get in there?
what?
you're deep shit.
I'm fucked!
I told you not to pick it up... Then I...
now I gotta drain my dragon.
what should I do?
how am I gonna pee...
with this shit on?
use a stick to support your ding-dong.
my foot is hurt. How am I gonna pee?
let's hide.
sit down.
that's Kwai.
y eah, right.
do a prank on him.
how?
he is coming. Let's hide.
surprise!
what's going on?
you've just been possessed.
possessed? That ghost doesn't go anywhere.
it's still around here.
hiding in one of you.
it's still around here...
because of the incense powder, right?
I think we should open a way for him to get out.
do you think I'm joking to you?
Hey! Close the circle!
don't worry. I can prove it.
whoever keeps this in your mouth he will be safe.
let me the first one to prove.
boy! The tongue move.
making sound. Very fit.
who's next?
Mo. Ah, you go first.
this is not some kind of joke.
let the soul be in too long you might end up losing your body.
Mo... go ahead!
I'll be next then.
at least I'm not the last one.
very smooth, aren't you?
Mo!
me? Y eah.
come on, Mo.
y uck!
madam, your fetish must already be dead!
Eww! It stinks too.
Kwai... what should I do, man?
this thing is sucked twice already.

t ake a pick.
no. I choose this one.
W an!
hey...

we did return you the offering.
I want your life.
what? We've given the offerings.
what else do you want from me?
I want your life! I want your life!
madam... what is going on here?
that means you did not complete the ritual.
there must be something wrong
or the wood that you brought...
...was not...
who did you ask about the wood?
that guy. We met him the other day.
I remember him.
Damn! That jerk again?
he is my worker.
I'm sorry.
he is kind of a dim bulb.
about the banyan tree that you've been looking for it was sent to a toothpick factory...
...around the F armer Market.
go check it out.
do you have toothpicks made from Banyan tree?
I don't sell those of a low-grade wood.
only high-grade are for sale here.

Amen!
a noodle seller and a Hainan-chicken seller are fighting for some kind of a fetish that is believed to bring good luck...

lieutenant... reporters are here for the toothpick case.
all right. Let him in.
good evening. This way, please.
the non-sense news always sells, doesn't it?
what do you wanna know?
can I have a look at that toothpick?
Sarge, bring the toothpick in.
watch out! It's haunted, you know?
is it gonna be on the headline?
a toothpick ghost.
what's a big deal about it?
just a piece of an ordinary toothpick
how could a ghost be in it?
I'm going to the restroom.
I forgot to tell you that I just use it.

what do you mean?
they all ran away?
I can't wait anymore.
Kwai, hold this.
you traitor didn't keep your promise.
isn't it a bit too late?
I'm so sorry that we return you the offering so late.
I don't want your apology. I want your friend's life.
he betrayed me...
why do you have to do this?
we've tried to find a piece of banyan tree.
please. I beg you. Give it to me.
all we want is taking our friend back.
it's not about you anymore.
or the opponent has known about our strategy.
then... you go ahead with the plan.
I'll take care of this point.
you gotta put them off.
there's a bridge about 500 meters from here.
let's meet over there.
do you think it's all about the votive prayer you gave me?
that's not it.
you can't remember, right?
document!
sir!
did you betray us?
the situation is changed.
or else we would become a rebel.
why do you have to be so harsh?
he is my friend!
do you have a fucking idea.
how long I've been waiting for you two.
I'm sorry.
it's my fault. Punish me...
so I can wash away my guilt.
kill me if it can release you from the hatred.
and your soul can be reborn.
but I'll be back to kill you in the next life.
you want it to be never-ended?
you don't want me to be enraged?
you deserted me...
when I think you all are my friends.
it's my fault that I can't help you.
you think we're happy about that?
think we're so happy all these times?
why do you have to be so harsh?
he is my friend!
we gotta find a scapegoat.
we promised that we won't abandon one another.
willing to die together.
after that day...
it's like we've passed a tough chapter of our life.
that made me understand the meaning of ' promise'.
and would never forget.
about Wan...
he himself didn't know what had happened.
and nobody had mentioned about it.
for Bell... After that day we didn't see her ever again.
Wow! This much better than beer
if I knew about it earlier. I'll never drink anything else.
it's strange. When we're gather here...
I'm thinking of Kwai.
speaking about him we haven't met him for a long time.
Kwai!
Oh, you ruined my image.
I've changed my name, you know?
Kally What?
Kally.
what?
Kally.
K-A-L-L and Y with a low tone.
honey, pronounce it.
Ahem. Kal-ly.
your tongue. Kal. Kal. I told you use your tongue.
Kal... Kal
kal
you're a funny girl.
kwai What?
your new bike? Very nice!
where did you get the money from?
I won a three-number j ackpot!
I asked it from the god.
the rain tree god.
the one next to the banyan tree.
didn't remember, huh?
I won the lotto so I got both bike and babe.
Hey, I never forget about you all.
I've also made a prayer for you.
you'll get bike and babe like me.
Kwai!
eight thousand years ago, atlantis sank beneath the ocean.
the great crystal, the source of its power, was hidden beneath the city.
robbed of the heart of atlantis, my people seemed doomed to slow extinction.
but now we are reborn.
Obby, hurry.
we must get back to the throne room.
hold on.
once again the heart of atlantis shines upon us...
healing us, making us strong.
we are using the power of the crystal to rebuild our city...
and to restore our culture to greatness.
under the light of the great crystal, my people are thriving again.
we have uncovered secrets lost for thousands ofyears.
the city is once again a centre of knowledge and learning...
instead of a place of ignorance and fear.
good day, queen kida. - good day and be careful.
my father thought it better to hide the crystal...
rather than risk the misuse of its power.
as queen, i can only hope i am doing the right thing.
how fitting. the old king need never shed tears again.
Obby. obby. all-all right. come on. show a little respect here.
I never thought the rebuilding of atlantis would move so quickly.
I think we only understand a fraction ofwhat the crystal can teach us.
well, i know that none of it would be possible without you.
okay, one rock.
you know, you're getting to look like one chubby lava dog.
what is it, obby? what is wrong?
queen kida.
there are intruders approaching the city.
Oh, my god.
this way, quick.
they're coming through the lava tubes. where is the patrol captain? i want them met with fliers.
wait. they're not intruders. they're friends.
Oh, it is beautiful.
Yeah. it's amazing what a little paint and spackle will do.
Audrey, what are you guys doing here?
just making sure you aren't making a mess of things down here.
come here. - hey.
Ah, two for flinching.
why, thankyou. i hope my hay fever doesn't kick up.
hello.
so, who wants to show me around the city? - oh, let me.
I will do it. - no, i saw her first. - no, no.
me, me. - me, me. - boys, boys, you're both pretty.
we'll all go.
Mesdemoiselles.
jeez, i missed you guys. but why are you here?
is mr whitmore okay? - why don't you ask him yourself?
Milo. - mr whitmore!
not only am i okay, but this crystal of yours makes me feel 20 years younger.
of course, that still leaves me pretty old.
and this must be princess kida, although i guess it would be queen kida now.
and you must be mr whitmore.
Thankyou. you brought milo to me and made all this possible.
come. iet us go inside where you can have something to eat.
I guess your decision to stay here wasn't as hard as i thought.
save my life!
you must try some of this. -delicious. -n-now, it's great to see you all again. - magnifiique.
trust me, this is great. - hm, not bad.
pepper sauce. never leave home without it.
puts a little giddy-up in every meal.
also makes a fine paint remover.
uh, sweet, i think this food just moved.
then you better eat it quick before it gets away.
besides, when it's alive, you don't have to swallow so hard.
just point them head first so they know which way to crawl.
your grandfather would be proud ofyou, milo.
you not only discovered a lost empire...
you probably saved the world from rourke's plans for the crystal.
and now you're helping restore atlantis to its former glory.
that's quite a rsum for a cartographer.
I just wish he could be here to see all this...
and to meet kida.
uh, yeah, well, it's great to see everybody together again...
but something tells me it's not just for a little reunion.
uh, i'm afraid you're right. there's trouble on the surface.
I already had my doctor, digger, demolition expert, mechanic.
each the top of their field.
but i came here for the one expert i didn't have
an expert on atlantis.
but why would you need a-- - several cargo ships have gone down in the north atlantic.
the survivors say it was a sea monster.
we thought it might be the watchdog at your front door.
the leviathan? - right. that's one big sea monster.
in the water, that's the last thing you wanna see.
except maybe my aunt rose in a swimsuit.
sweet woman, but very large-boned.
I'm glad it knew we were friends this time.
but there could be others out there.
my father had many such machines created.
he used the magic and science of the crystal to expand the borders of atlantis.
that war nearly destroyed the world.
well, it looks like his war may not be over.
then milo and i will go with you to the surface and end it.
kida, you can't. i-i mean, you're the queen.
the city repairs are well under way.
the counsellors can handle the everyday matters.
and i-- i feel responsible for what my father did.
I want to understand his decision...
and i am afraid the answers are not in atlantis.
I feel bad. you finally get to the surface...
and it's so cloudy, there's nothing to see.
everything in your world is new to me.
the sky, the clouds, everything on the ship.
what is this? - that's a life preserver.
so you wear it and it preserves your life, like our crystals?
no, no. you throw it to someone in the water.
Oh, so it is a game?
no. you only throw it if someone is drowning.
does that not make it hard for them to play the game?
two weeks we crisscross the north sea and get nothing.
no squids, no jellyfish and no lobster from atlantis.
we have to be sure, vinny.
what if raising the crystal brought this leviathan to life?
this could all be the fault of atlantis.
I'd worry more about how we fight it than who's to blame.
Iast time we shot at the leviathan, these things didn't even tickle it.
eh, audrey, ifyou keep hitting that thing...
we're gonna be tickled " all over these walls.
Yeah, yeah. iike i don't know that.
well, careful. doc sweet's not here to glue us back together.
this time it's my special blend.
I start with a batter of gelatinous nitroglycerine...
dribble it on a shaped charge oftnt...
and top it with just a dusting of black powder...
and oregano.
you can't make a bomb without oregano.
it makes a very nice boom. "
Iet the lobster chew on that.
y-you know, i really don't think it is a leviathan.
the survivor called it the kraken
a legendary norwegian sea monster with arms a quarter mile long.
nothing like what we saw in atlantis.
but atlantean inventors always base their designs on real animals, like the giant squid.
it may not be a leviathan, but it could still be an atlantean war machine.
she's right. no creature of flesh and blood...
can bring down a steel cargo ship.
something's got the ship!
it's ripping open the launch doors.
my cheese!
you can have it.
get to the sub pods. vinny, we're gonna need that thing out of the way.
coming up, extra oregano.
Iaunch when ready.
next time, chilli powder.
Uh-oh. that doesn't sound good.
it's pulling them down on the starboard side.
Where's milo and kiida? i didn't see them launch.
Milo, are you there? kiida?
come on, come on. back-up batteries.
time to back-up.
...thing ofifimy back while i look fior milo. - this is milo.
we're on back-up batteries, sinking fast, no propulsion.
we have a major leak-- - leaks.
Ieaks. and the view port is cracking.
Ifithe ballast valves aren't blockked, you can filush the water by rerouting the pressure tubes and
Audrey, we are up to our rear ends in water.
it's no time for how-to books.
Okkay, okkay. we're coming.
jeez. - well, you'd better hurry 'cause...
we're about to hit an undersea mountain.
that is not a mountain.
Audrey! - got you covered, milo.
watch your right dive plane. - no problem.
uh, where's the kirakken? - it has disappeared.
at least it was not atlantean.
somehow, that doesn't make me feel any safer.
the creature buckled hull plates fore and aft.
we'll be lucky to get to the port for repairs.
I'll send a launch fioryou. - don't worry about us, captain.
just take care of the atlantean.
there's a fishing village to the northeast. we'll be there when you finish repairs.
whoa. that's your sub pod. that's not coming out of my pay cheque.
okay, let's get to shore as soon as we can.
what's the matter, vinny, afraid to play patty-cake with the sea monster, ooh?
no. i don't mind a little patty-cake...
but i really don't wanna be here when the bombs on that sub pod hit bottom.
I guess fishing hasn't been too good lately, huh?
that is not surprising. no doubt that tentacled demon...
devoured the local fish stocks long ago.
then why is it still here? - because it doesn't eat fish any more.
maybe that's why they built the village on the cliffs.
you don't want that thing showing up for dinner.
not real friendly, are they? - ew, what is that smell? it's like rotting fish.
why do you accuse such a thing? i have bathed. recently.
Hmph. no appreciation for fine cologne.
easy, mole. she's upwind ofyou.
I'd say it's more likely we're smelling all this mildew.
everything is wet from the fog.
but you do need a bath.
Iook at that.
interesting way of attracting tourists.
Milo, we got company.
I am edgar volgud, the magistrate of this town.
what is your business here? - nice to meet you.
my name is milo thatch. - i doubt there is anything in krakenstadt that concerns you.
and what about your town pet that nearly sank our ship?
your ship will be repaired at the shipyards oftronheim.
you should leave soon. the roads are treacherous after dark.
I'm sure they can start repairs without us.
we thought we'd stick around a while and enjoy the scenery.
tronheim has excellent views. - all the same, we'll stay.
miss allyson is the innkeeper here.
she'll give you rooms for the night.
a driver will take you to tronheim tomorrow.
I've seen that fellow before someplace
I think under a rock. reminds me of a leech, a worm.
a kind of, uh, salamanderish
Obby, no!
he was born in molten rock. - wasn't volgud that statue guy?
that would make him even older than he looks...
which i gotta say is pretty darn old.
they say he made a deal with the devil to live forever...
but forgot to ask for eternal youth.
this will drive the fog from your bones.
Thankyou. - merci, mademoiselle.
thank you, miss allyson?
Inger. there is a darkness around edgar volgud...
and that shadow has dimmed all that was happy here.
we would leave, but this inn is all we have.
it is no place for me to raise my little one.
things will not change here until its power is broken.
its? you mean volgud's? - or the sea monster's?
I will prepare rooms foryou.
but do not cross edgar volgud...
and leave as soon as you can.
they gotta work on their tourist industry.
come on. just follow his lantern.
where is that coming from? - what is it?
it is not of this earth.
no. that's a bird. a very big gooney bird.
or a, uh, puffin...
with a very upset stomach.
uh, no, it's voices. i can't make out what they're
Where's volgud? - his light is gone.
we could be walking in circles.
we'd better head back to the village.
and which way would that be?
Oh, over there. head for the lights before the fog closes in again.
just a moment. iisten to the gravel.
not now, mole. - but this is decomposed granite...
which would mean we are headed for the cliff
Audrey!
I'm okay.
for now.
be careful, milo. - i'm climbing down to you, audrey.
stay where you are. - here i was, all set to take a walk.
Audrey, keep talking to me.
I said thankyou very much for leading us off a cliff.
Hey, i was heading toward the village...
Iights.
uh, i guess there's more going on here than sea monsters.
Oh, great. somebody's doin' hocus-pocus.
I hate hocus-pocus.
I-- i can't reach.
I'll have to jump. - uh, don't jump.
I'll climb down. - there's no room. i have to jump.
Audrey, i'm the team leader, and i orderyou not to jump.
Oh, that's it!
see? - audrey!
you see, you cannot live without me.
gather the possessions of the strangers...
and burn them.
what's the matter, volgud? you think we've got fleas?
gee. you seem surprised to see us.
definitely worm or leech. salamanders are too cute.
we'd like to hear more about volgud's deal with the devil.
it is an old wives' story, a folk tale, nothing more.
Inger, we want to help.
Iives have been taken at sea, and i suspect in this town.
I would love to let my little one play outside again.
Iong ago, the fish left the sea.
the town was in danger of dying. a bargain was struck.
the souls of the people for the life of the town.
the kraken? - sometimes known as the devil fish. "
the town is provided for, but no one can leave.
and the sun has not shone since.
folklore or not, there is a connection between the kraken and this town.
volgud hands out food and supplies from somewhere.
maybe a hidden cave?
I could search. would make a very nice boom.
ha. the answer is staring at you right in the face.
regard. how an igneous boulder...
has been futilely disguised as sedimentary rock.
they might as well paint a road sign.
they look exactly the same to me.
Yeah, but you weren't raised by naked mole rats.
that would explain so much.
this is all from the sunken freighter.
there's volgud.
volgud is controlling the kraken. - how?
table scraps and a rolled-up newspaper? -he's not using table scraps.
it's some sort of mental power.
Iook at the workers. they look hypnotized.
I think he uses that power to enslave the creature...
telling it what ships to attack.
ifwe can rattle volgud's concentration, he'll lose control over the kraken.
tickling will be good. nobody can concentrate when they're being tickled.
or, uh, a bomb. a bomb is a very good distraction.
Shh! wait. where's audrey?
sacrebleu!
get audrey. i'll distract him.
what? but he's unconscious. it should go away.
Audrey!
okay, now we try plan b-- plan bomb.
no. not at the creature. at the ceiling.
how about picking the target before i light the dynamite, huh?
get to the sub pods. we have to stop the kraken from getting out.
out of our way, barbarians!
Talkk to me, mole. we got to fiind that cave exit.
our best chance to trap the kraken is to seal him inside.
Audrey, you doing all right?
Yeah. now. eww! it was creepy.
all cold and slimy. everything fiaded away likke i was drowning.
Hey, pay attention!
it is too dark to see. fire the magnesium flares.
what are you doing? we want to sneak up on
Jiminy christmas! it's already out!
Oh, stay clear ofithe tentacles. - no kidding. i'm gonna take a shot.
it's no good. i can't line up a decent shot.
we're on him.
open wide. it's chow time.
what are you waiting for? fire the
Jeez!
tell him to watch his aim. he almost hit aud-- look out!
shoot at the squid, not us!
Vincent has gone mad!
his mind is a blankk. - but volgud
it's not volgud. it's the kraken.
of course. the kraken is the one with the mind powers.
it is okay. i have distracted him.
watch out! monster on the move!
Oh. that was really strange.
I'm down to my last shot. - as am i.
head back to the beach. we've got to get on dry land.
no.
are you crazy? you're heading right at it!
I will distract him again.
Aah! i am blinded! - it's milo's sub pod.
it's got a fiull load ofitorpedoes. we can blow them all at once.
Iet's do it!
you kknow, i thinkk mrsquid was a little bit hocus-pocus himselfi.
Oh, yeah, you won't find the kraken in any biology book.
the curse is lifted, the fish are back...
and the mildew has been scrubbed away.
so if something stinks now, uh
what? why you do this with your hand?
it is the fish.
for 8, 000 years, i have lived with the same faces.
it is strange to meet new people.
and each new person has new thoughts, new ideas.
your world has much to offer.
I hope one day my people, the people of atlantis, can offer as much.
well, there's no reason they can't.
your people can make a difference to the world, like we did here.
now that there's no kraken, it's left to people like inger allyson...
to raise their little ones in peace.
we can never thank them enough.
now you can grow big and strong...
and someday be the most important person in town.
now give mama a big hug.
please tell me that's not the same stuff you fed us on the way to atlantis.
bet your sweet eyes it is. now i told you...
it would keep and keep and keep.
and now it's yours to eat and eat and eat.
that's right, margie. they showed me all around the city.
Yeah. it broke their hearts, but i need my space.
Kemot was too clingy.
careful, mole. obidalbedsugs aren't used to such a variety in their diet.
it's only a few assorted silicates i've been meaning to get rid of.
Oh. it's good for the gums.
Hey, where's kida?
it's even more beautiful when the snow melts.
this time there was no leviathan.
but how do we know there are not other atlantean weapons out there?
uh, not looking at the scenery, huh?
maybe the crystal's too powerful.
maybe it should remain buried.
but your people, they've regained so much.
could you put them in darkness again?
what are the chances of another gas leak in a chinese laundry?
so that's my last flower shop.
but i'm thinking about buying a laundry.
so, i guess now that we know there's no leviathan on the loose...
excuse me. - you two will be heading back home to atlantis.
excuse me. - it's a laundry-slash-fireworks
but don't be in such a rush. take some time to see the world.
plane fare is on me.
that's very generous, mr whitmore. - may i haveyour attention, please?
hmm, that's better. it's dr sweet.
there's trouble in the southwest.
Sam's a long-time field agent of mr whitmore's.
he's best at digging up hard-to-find objects.
only this time, i think something found him.
and you say he mentioned killer coyotes in a sandstorm?
mm, no, not exactly.
more like a sandstorm made up of killer coyotes who were made up of sand.
and this is unusual in your world?
Oh, yes. more than a little bit.
but i do not understand why you wanted me here.
because of this.
Milo, it is atlantean.
uh, where did you find this? - you'll have to ask sam.
I can't tell if he's breathing. - eh, perhaps he is dead.
Oh, he's just sleeping. afterwhat he's been through, i'm sure he can use the rest.
Hey. aah! get away, you furry carcass rats!
it's all right, mr mckeane. you're safe now. mr whitmore sent us.
Oh, good old preston. best man i ever scavenged for.
er, say, young fella, could you fluff up my pillow?
now, uh, how about a sip ofwater? my gullet's awful dry.
Ohh! ow! ow! ow! - what's wrong?
got a little sleepy in the foot.
uh, would you mind givin' it a rub? - ewww!
and you say coyotes did this to you?
no. 'twernt no ordinary coyotes.
these was cantankerous sand coyotes.
'twernt a lick ofwind all day...
but i sure heard it howlin' up on the mesas that night.
I thought i was loco when i saw them dust devils materializing in moonlight.
their red eyes like to burn a hole right through my soul.
came screamin' off that ridge like a pack of ghosts.
I ran back to my shack and bolted the door.
I figured i'd be safe if i stayed inside. i was wrong.
scratched me up like a two-sizes-too-small wool sweater on a hot afternoon.
Iuckily, i had plenty of bacon grease to rub all over my hide...
to ease the chaffin'. - dinnertime.
mr mckeane, what have we told you about the bacon grease?
works better than any ofyour darn fool fix-'em-ups.
I stood a better chance with them coyotes.
is he going to be all right? - oh, yes.
we're moving him to the hospital in scottsdale where he'll be their problem.
so where did you find this?
in a pot. - what pot?
in the crate. - what crate?
in my shack. - what shack?
hmm. i'm not surprised this is where he lives.
you saw the man eat, right? iives like he eats-- sloppy.
maid's day off, huh?
quartz, uh, silicate, mixed with local clay.
mm, uh, slightly nutty to the taste. nothing unusual.
sand isn't the only thing here that's nutty.
everything seems to have been rubbed smooth.
even the windows are etched. from the sand?
Mckeane said they were sand coyotes.
I see lots of sand, no coyotes. no paw prints either.
looks like the crate's-- - missin'?
dang blame it! i know just what varmint done took it too.
it'd be that shifty-eyed, back-stabbin' rattlesnake ashton carnaby.
he runs a tradin' post outside of town. you best be careful.
he's slicker than a sweaty toad in a rainstorm.
Iet's look around a little first.
we don't know for certain that this carnaby guy took sam's crate.
no, obby! stay! stay!
he's, uh, a brazilian iguana.
eats just about anything. trust me.
there are pieces here that are hundreds ofyears old.
Oh, look, an antique.
how are people to use these things if they're locked behind glass?
it's for protection. - i know what the spear is for.
no, the glass case is for protection.
wouldn't the spear be better protection than a glass case?
yes-- no!
it's there to protect from someone who might want to steal it.
why would someone want to steal a glass case?
calcified limestone more than 25 million years old...
from the cenozoic era.
hydrated aluminium silicates with basalt...
found primarily in the southern colorado river basin.
plastic! bleeck!
Milo, it's just like an atlantean guardian.
it's been modified by noshoni design.
either way, i am buying it.
ho ho. that's what i like to hear.
because i want to sell it. the name's carnaby.
now, that painting's of crystal guardian...
who crawled from the earth with weapons of blue fire.
he was a great teacher and healer of the sick.
or so the legend goes. - how much is it?
well, that's a museum-class piece.
I'll bet there's a museum-class price to go with it too.
it is rare, and i've had offers. - is this enough?
kida, that-that's a lot-- - sold! one crystal guardian.
so, mr carnaby, where exactly do you get all ofyour artefacts?
well, uh, here and there.
but the older pieces are 1 00% authentic, i assure you.
Oh, i don't doubt that. - well, we're looking for a crate...
that may have been taken from sam mckeane.
who are you people?
we're associates of sam mckeane, and he's asked us to help locate the missing crate.
uh, can't help you.
Mckeane has a tendency to tell stories.
I think he gets lonely out there in the desert.
so you don't know anything about it?
if mckeane lost a crate of pottery, that's not my problem.
what in the red rock river valley are you doin'?
sampling the bowl. it is very nice.
would you like some?
well, that could have gone better.
does it strike anybody as odd that carnaby knows the missing crate contains pottery?
because i never mentioned what was in it. - you are right.
I don't trust that carnaby. don't like him one bit.
didn't like his attitude. didn't like his shifty little eyes.
eyes are the windows to the soul, you know?
how would you like to gaze into the windows of my soul?
Hey, didn't we just pass that guy?
perhaps they are brothers?
twice is a coincidence. but three times? i think someone's trying to tell us something.
uh, hello. can we offeryou a ride?
it's a long walk to anywhere.
my name is chakashi. and, yes, a ride would be welcome.
Oh, he's, uh, brazilian.
I'm familiarwith all nature's creatures.
this one is also known to me.
you wouldn't happen to have a twin or two, would you?
there are many noshoni men who walk alone in the desert.
and we look all the same to the eyes of outsiders.
Ah, crystal guardian, our great teacher and protector.
he revealed many secrets to the noshoni.
the path of the stars, the time to plant, how to heal themselves.
and like crystal guardian...
we will also protect our sacred beliefs from outsiders.
those who would plunder our lands to betray our secrets...
will answer to the ancient forces of the desert.
a sandstorm? where did that come from?
we are followed.
there are ancient powers that will make certain our secrets are kept...
and you, more than anyone, should understand this.
they're trying to drive us off the road.
I just put in that windshield.
he's gone! - how? where could he go?
people, we got bigger problems. they're in here with us.
no. dust doggies, go away!
Ohh! this is just great!
the intake's got a thirty-torque tolerance that's been blown...
and the combustion valves need a new ring slip!
I didn't quite get all that. - i build these engines from scratch.
I fend off lava dogs who eat the distributor caps.
and nobody told me i would have to deal with dust storm coyotes.
if they got sand in the manifold, i quit!
did you get it all that time? - every word.
we have returned. - we are back at the trading post.
chakashi said there were ancient forces at work.
uh, make a note to stay on their good side.
better yet, no more picking up hitchhikers.
Hey, uh, i told you people to leave.
we have a couple of questions. - i've already answered your questions.
pet iguana. eats anything-- meaning you might be on the menu.
how do you know that the missing crate contains pottery?
uh, i don't. uh, i, uh
and what do you know about an old man who calls himself chakashi?
I know i got a shelf full of painted rocks of him inside.
of course. chakashi.
the noshoni wind spirit. - we gave a ride to a spirit?
you can't really believe in that superstition.
well, we were just attacked by a pack of phantom coyotes in a sandstorm.
the same restless spirits that came after sam mckeane.
and whoever has that crate of pottery.
save it. i'm not superstitious.
Oh, i smell old pottery.
you had the crate all along. - voil!
it's rubbed smooth. just like the inside of mckeane's shack.
well, there's no way you could prove it. - sandstone, heavy red oxides, basalt...
encrusted with the same silicate found in mckeane's shack.
well, so what? mckeane found it in the desert...
and then while he was in the hospital, i found it in his shack.
that is called stealing.
that's called commerce, honey.
besides, mckeane's the only one who knows the location ofwhere the pot came from.
judging from the high alkaline content...
I would say it came from a cave on the south face of the mogollon rim...
fifteen miles north of here.
Mm-hmm. he's good. dirty, but good.
well, you know, maybe i didn't take things seriously enough.
there are a lot of old tales and mysteries out here in the desert...
and the coyotes you encountered are a good example.
I thought you didn't believe.
well, i sure don't want to end up like mckeane.
so maybe if the pot's returned, that'll settle these restless spirits.
I, gaetan moliere, have done it.
I have found the subterranean gateway...
that is the very threshold to the unknown!
Ah. it's just a hole. - a hole? blaah!
Iook at the lines in the basalt.
the beauty of the erosion. the poetry of the clay.
this is not a hole. it is a tunnel. - huh.
I don't care what you call it. just tell me it's big enough to hide in. 'cause we got company!
inside! quick!
I will save us!
Milo.
holy cats!
none of this should exist. not in the same place.
it's a blending of every culture from idaho to peru.
Noshoni, aztec, mayan, olmec.
my people were here.
Ohh! crystal guardian was an atlantean.
his teaching influenced all these cultures.
a little bit of atlantis goes a long way.
Carnaby, that old pot can fit on any of those ledges. carnaby?
what is that? - sorry. it was me.
hold on. that was not me!
carnaby! - oh, about the pot.
it looks like i'm going to be keeping it along with everything else in here.
that home-made prairie grass mixture makes a good sleeping gas...
wouldn't you agree?
Carnaby, you snake!
naturally, i can't let you go free to tell the world about my discovery.
I mean, where's the profit in that?
what? carnaby!
nice nap? hope the rocks weren't too uncomfortable.
Oh, no. this particular aggregate is very nice. one of my favourites.
you will not get away with this. - mm, let's see.
I trap you and your friends in this cave...
and then i take all the treasure for myself...
but i think i'll get away with it.
I knew there was something shifty about you. didn't i say so?
I said, i don't trust that carnaby. don't like him one bit.
don't like this attitude. don't like his shifty little eyes. "
and don't forget. the eyes are the windows to the soul.
Mm-hmm. that's right. i said that too.
well, you and your friends will have a long time...
to discuss how you feel about me while i'm gettin' rich.
we have found evidence of my people here.
we cannot let him destroy it.
mr carnaby, obviously we've had some sort of miscommunication here.
I don't see any reason why we can't work something out.
save your breath, junior. you're gonna need it.
happy trails.
it's no use.
if there was only some way to cut these ropes.
obby! - obby, come on, boy. wake up.
wake up!
that's it. okay. enough!
No! no! get the ropes! the ropes!
good boy. - no! take care of the dynamite first!
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah. right, right.
Kida!
you've managed to be more trouble than i expected.
I'll just take care ofyou myself-- ohh!
Oh, now you done it. gone and made us mad.
uh, what is this? - retribution.
anyone out here got a doggy bone?
what happened to carnaby? - he is with us now.
you seem like good people. i'm sorry.
the secrets of the ancient ancestors must remain a secret.
you will not be allowed to leave.
Chakashi, we also carry a great secret.
thus, we can keep yours as well.
what is this secret?
prove to me that it is as great as what you see around you.
we can't. - very well.
you have decided your fate.
ifyou had told me your secret...
I would have known i couldn't trust you with mine.
Hmph. it was a trick question. - must be the coyote in me.
kida of atlantis, you and i are not so different.
your people touched the corners of the globe, teaching and healing.
doing great good. - but they also did great harm...
almost destroying the world and themselves.
my father feared the temptation to abuse our power would be too great.
so he hid it away.
the secret you carry is neither good nor bad.
a strong leader must have the wisdom to know when to share that knowledge.
it would be wonderful if my people did not need to remain hidden...
to have them walk the surface of the world again.
it is your choice.
Whoa! that was impressive.
I would have been more impressed if chakashi had dropped us off on the ground.
it's strange, all right. started early this morning.
but i guess you had your share ofweird weather in the southwest.
it was okay. except for how i keep finding sand everywhere.
I could go for some warm weather about now. maybe get a tan.
sorry i missed it. - oh, no, you are not.
there were dust doggies everywhere. but i did find this very tasty bowl.
well, mr whitmore, kida and i had better be going because
Atlantis is waiting.
I know. just as well. - what?
Ah, we had break-in last night. - are you okay?
Yes, i'm fine. but it burns me that someone could waltz right in here...
and steal something right off my wall-- an ancient norwegian spear.
kind of a fancy old letter opener.
what you needed was a glass case to protect it.
he must have come in the middle of the night.
by the tracks i found, he had some kind of dog with him.
the real strange thing is, near as i can tell, there's no sign of forced entry.
whoever it was knew exactly what they were looking for and helped themselves.
with this spear of destiny...
shall i, odin, king of the northern gods...
end this world.
why would someone take an old spear...
when there's so much other junk around?
don't get me wrong. it's, uh, all good junk.
I'm more interested in these scorch marks on the floor.
Iike lightning struck here.
obby!
it cannot be the lightning.
see foryourself. there's no hole in the roof.
no black powder. not explosives.
fire did not fall from the sky in atlantis like it does here.
I do not like it. - yeah, me neither. mr whitmore...
I'm thinking that wasn't any ordinary spear, was it?
do i own anything that's ordinary?
regardless, i do have a good idea who took it.
the man's name is erik hellstrom.
son of a gun was a fierce competitor of mine.
built a shipping empire with cruise liners.
when he bought the biggest dang castle in the old country...
and named it asgard...
the press dubbed him the modern odin. "
Yeah, he liked being treated as a god, and he lived like one...
until the stock market crash sank his company.
he lost his money, his power and, i think, his mind.
hadn't heard from him till he phoned last week...
desperately trying to convince me to sell the spear to him.
raving about ragnarok.
what is ragnarok?
doomsday in the old norse myths.
but why did mr hellstrom want the spear?
seems to me i remember something about a spear in the shepherd'sjournal.
I found it. gunokkneer. - gesundheit.
no, no. gunokkneer was the name of an atlantean spear.
the spear hellstrom stole from whitmore was the same spear-- an atlantean spear.
weapons of atlantis contain untold power.
if the myths are right, that's an understatement.
at ragnarok, the final night of the world...
Odin will use the spear to summon the forces of chaos and destruction.
he's going to use the spear to bring about ragnarok.
Armageddon. - judgement day. - the end of the world.
the end of atlantis. of everything.
my father foresaw this. - your father was trying to save his empire, kida.
this guy's just frosted 'cause he's in the poor house.
F-f-frosted.
it-it's iceland, you see?
so if hellstrom is going to be stopped...
it looks like you're going to iceland.
why can't ragnarok be in miami? you know, a nice, warm place.
I'm never gonna get a tan.
kida? - milo...
my father knew the power of atlantis would be abused like this.
as king, it was his responsibility to do as he saw fit.
perhaps it is the same with hellstrom.
Yeah, but hellstrom gave himself this crown...
and he isn't trying to save anybody.
and that's a big difference.
we ought to be nearing iceland. and that name ain't just for show.
with any luck, this weather will lighten up.
we should not be flying in such a storm.
we'll crash. we are too high above the dirt.
you know, the weather hasn't let up since hellstrom stole that spear.
I wonder if-- - coincidence, milo.
take over, vinny.
I mean, come on. the old gods affecting the weather?
well, there was that indian wind god, spirit, whatever, kraken.
Yeah, the kraken might have been a god. maybe not.
Oh, vinny!
and that big atlantis crystal...
that was kind of like a god.
all i'm saying, we see a lot of strange stuff.
I'm, uh, just being open-minded.
well, you let go of my plane that way...
and i'll toss your open mind right into that soup.
but we are over land now. good solid land. yes.
relax, mole. we've been over iceland for minutes.
the land's as solid as
uh, you're gonna want to take a look at this.
Hellstrom's castle? what did you call it?
Asgard. home of the gods.
this is the power of the spear.
that's what i call ""home improvement. "
look out! we'll crash! we'll crash! - relax.
we're not going to crash into any mountain.
unless it stands up.
you missed us.
that thing could have been a god.
buckle up! we're going down!
piece of cake.
Oh, my beautiful land.
Mm! my lips! - i am sorry foryour flying machine, audrey.
easy come, easy go.
uh, oh, look at the bright side. uh, w-we're alive.
but we're not exactly getting a warm welcome.
maybe i'll give him a present.
Oh, great. more hocus-pocus.
I bid you welcome...
to the hall of odin.
uh, listen, mr hellstrom, you've caught some bad breaks...
but there's no reason to take it out on the world.
I know you. - it's the spear.
its power is one of destruction. it will destroy you, uh, all of us.
ha! i know you. you're the trickster-- loki.
you seek the power of my spear. - no.
you'll not trick me.
stop, mr hellstrom. mm, my lord, odin.
I know the power ofyour spear.
the same power almost destroyed my father.
father?
of course. brunhilde, my daughter. my valkyrie.
you've come to rule the new world at my side.
no. i am not your daughter...
but i do care about you.
Kida!
neither man nor god will stop ragnarok.
I cast thee out of asgard...
to your doom.
do not drop me. - you could lay off the eclairs, you know.
I cannot help it. it's the creme filling.
mole, we need you up here. - go away. i am praying.
mole, we got one chance. we need you to dig.
mole stays. - mole!
Oh, fine. i will come.
it is always mole that must save the day.
Hey, watch it. don't make me sorry i saved you.
a good thing that you are not any skinnier, milo.
perhaps you should eat more eclairs.
get on with it.
you know, i'm not used to this going up.
as a digger, i dig down, deep into the earth.
see, of course you may have noticed i am rather afraid of heights and
Dig!
you see? you are a warrior born...
my brunhilde, my daughter.
I am not your daughter.
I am kiyadacash, queen of atlantis.
what have you done with my friends?
I cast them out, brunhilde, into the abyss below.
No!
it could not be helped.
we must go, daughter. the chaos lord of fire must be awoken before sundown.
today must be ragnarok.
Yes. iet us leave. quickly.
what do you see?
he's using the spear to carry them to the volcano.
what else is out there? - his hundred-foot bodyguard.
and i see our only way out-- this big wooden door.
ifwe can find a way to open it
just call me the doorman.
so we can get out, but we still can't go anywhere.
Heh. we are trapped.
what are we to do, ride this door down the stairs like a ski jump?
Oh, no. no, no, no. no!
Whoa! i believe that we should all lean. whoa!
move over, mole. i'll pilot this thing.
move over where? - everybody lean left.
mole, your other left.
roadblock!
pull me up!
no, milo. we could use you like a rudder.
Yeah, he's gonna have a limp after that one.
hellstrom, you must listen to me.
my father-- - yes?
no. my real father.
he hid away this power so it could not be used for destruction.
it was to be used for love, for life, for all that is good.
hellstrom, stop this madness. i beg you.
use this power to heal the world.
Brunhilde, that's exactly what i intend to do.
I, alone, am destined to remake it and rule over it anew.
to begin again, i must destroy what is.
no. you cannot.
Kida!
you'll not stop me, loki.
Io! ragnarok!
say your goodbyes to this world...
and herald in my new order.
even at the end, the forces of darkness would thwart the king of the gods.
you're not the king of anything, hellstrom.
you're a boat builder.
shoo, birds. shoo.
No!
there now. ragnarok approaches.
it is i, odin, who shall stand triumphant.
you really think you're still in charge?
those two are done taking orders.
and the fire lord will set the sky ablaze.
and the earth will become as ice as a new age dawns.
so, milo, you got a plan?
eh, just thought i'd ask.
wait a second. i-i do have a plan.
now a little heat.
it's working. - oh, now they're ticked.
the spear! - i will get it!
Vinny, we need another bomb. - i'm fresh out.
Kida! - i'm all right, milo.
my asgard! my kingdom! no!
give him a while. iet him mourn his kingdom.
then we'll get him to a hospital where maybe he can be helped.
and as for that thing, i'm thinking you should put it in a safe. iike now.
maybe with some chains, and locks-- big ones.
I have a better place for this spear.
I learned many things from your world.
most of all, i think i now know my father better.
my father was only protecting us and the world above...
when he hid the heart of atlantis.
I understand that now.
uh, kida, you can't hide the crystal again. i mean, it would
Oh. sorry. sort of ruining the moment there.
but-- - but my father was wrong.
he thought mankind would use the power of the crystal for destruction.
but look around you. the heart of atlantis has let us rebuild our city.
and i saw how the knowledge of atlantis touched a tribe of surface people...
and made them great healers and teachers.
the brightest light is worth nothing if hidden in a cave.
I do not want the legacy of atlantis...
to be the destruction of its civilization.
Iet us share our light with the world.
huh?
what is that light, queen kida? is it a crystal?
no, child.
it is the sun.
I think i swallowed my gum.
I came to America in 1914, by way of Philadelphia.
that's where I got off the boat.
and then I came to Baltimore.
it was the most beautiful place you've ever seen in your life.
there were lights everywhere. what lights they had!
it was a celebration of lights.
I thought they were for me: "Sam was in America.
Sam was in America.
I didn 't know what holiday it was, but there were lights.
and I walked under them.
the sky exploded! People cheered!
there were fireworks. what a welcome it was!
what a welcome!
I didn 't know where my brothers were.
I had an address on a letter, but when I went there, they'd moved.
I found the man who knew the name Krichinsky.
he was a little man with big shoes. I'll never forget him.
he had such big shoes! They were brand-new, beautiful shoes.
he told me this was how he made his living.
he would break in shoes for the wealthy.
stuff them with newspaper and walk in them.
I said, "what a country is this. what a country.
the wealthy didn 't even have to break in their own shoes.
so this man with the shoes took me down one street after another.
we walked and walked and the skies would light up and explode in a celebration.
and then we came to Avalon.
and the man with the shoes yelled, "Krichinsky! Krichinsky!
and my four brothers looked down and saw me.
Sam!
Sam.
Sam.
and that's when I came to America. It was the Fourth of July.
boy, did they used to celebrate. Big celebrations.
they closed the streets and would celebrate through the night.
what happened to the guy who wore the big shoes?
the funny thing is, he did it for another two years.
he brought his brother into the business.
they would walk the streets, breaking in shoes. Then he got an idea!
why not make shoes that fit right?
they became custom shoemakers: The Solomon Brothers.
they made shoes, pants. And then they were a department store.
but the Krichinsky brothers, wallpaper hangers.
the five Krichinsky brothers, wallpaper hangers.
and we worked and worked and worked.
except Gabriel didn't work.
Gabriel used to point a lot. "There's a crease, it's not straight.
he was the inspector. He was the inspector.
how did you all get to be wallpaper hangers?
it was your grandfather William.
he came to America first and worked in the department store...
...where they sold wallpaper and do wallpaper hanging for people.
so he became a wallpaper hanger.
and as each brother came over, we all became wallpaper hangers.
but on the weekend, we made music.
what music it was!
we liked American music. we were very popular ourselves.
one night...
I looked across the floor and I saw this young, lovely girl.
I wasn 't handsome, and I didn 't have a beautiful body.
but when I touched a woman...
...they fell in love with me.
Oh, the family! How it grew. The wives, the kids.
Krichinskys everywhere, everywhere.
so we had the family-circle meetings.
we put money in the hat to bring over the cousins, the aunts, the uncles.
and then, out of the blue, william gets the flu.
it was a terrible epidemic, the flu of 1 91 9.
thousands died.
william died.
he was a young man. He left three kids.
Sam, how many times do we have to hear this story?
we know this story. We heard it before.
if we don't tell them, they don't know. Last year, Bill died.
was very warm Iast year when Bill died.
how many times do we have to hear this?
the children know this story.
I'm telling them about when I came here.
Yeah, we know about it. We all heard it before.
dad, you want to cut the turkey, or do you want me to?
I wanted to tell them about when my father came here.
you have plenty of time to talk about your father.
sorry we're Iate.
another minute, we would've cut the turkey without you and started to eat.
to cut the turkey without me present?
we Ieave the house!
we didn't cut the turkey. -I heard the turkey was cut.
I was just talking about when Bill died.
thank God we are Iate.
I don't understand this holiday. I'II never understand it.
what's not to understand? -Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving.
we're giving thanks to who?
you're giving thanks for what you have.
how many times do we have to go through this?
aII I'm saying is, we had to get the turkey and kill it to give thanks.
if it wasn't this holiday, we wouldn't have turkey.
I don't eat turkey the rest of the year. Why do I have to now?
mom, don't give thanks, okay?
time to tell the kids when my father came to America.
can't it wait till Iater?
they should hear this story.
Eva, this is very tender.
of course it is. It's a beautiful bird.
the turkey was in the basement alive. She killed it.
we brought my father over in '25.
25? -William died in 1919. '25.
25? It was Iater than '25!
he came the same year we brought Bill and Edith.
bill and Edith came after!
after? -Yeah, after.
it was '26.
what's the difference? He came to America, right?
it's a big difference between '25 and '26.
one is '25 and the other is '26.
AII's I'm saying is, who cares if it was '25 or '26?
Jules, Jules, if you stop remembering, you forget.
it was '26.
I remember the excitement when you went to meet him.
finally, the father was coming. we saved the money and sent it to him.
the whole family went to the border
Jules, you were just a little kid.
it was cold!
we went to the marketplace. It was cold. It was cold.
what are you talking about, it was cold? It was Iate May.
may? I remember cold.
no, you're thinking of when Irene was getting married.
it was bitter cold then. No, it was May 1 7 when your father came.
anyway, we went, the whole family.
the brothers, the wives, the kids.
I didn't go, and all the kids didn't go.
we waited in the house.
there was such excitement. The father, the father was coming.
aII I ever heard was, "Wait until the father comes.
the head of the family. I pictured this big, powerful man.
all I'd heard was, "wait until the father comes.
the father's word when he speaks...
so I'm there. I see him.
he's shorter than me, and I'm only 6.
he was this little...
he was a Iittle, Iittle man.
I never said he was big.
but I said he was the father.
from the day...
from the day he came to America, he never had to work.
not a day in his life. Each of us would give him 10 percent.
right? Right? Yeah.
ten percent. He was the father.
he never drank water.
the entire time he was in America, from the day he came...
...he drank whiskey or seltzer water.
he never drank water.
and oh, boy, could he drink!
what was that stuff called he always used to drink?
SIivovitz. SIivovitz.
he used to call it "BIock and Fall.
you have one drink of that, you walk one block and you fall!
if you have one drink...
it's such a strong drink, it burned the gums out.
he was funny. He was funny. Very, very, very funny.
how often did he drink water?
never, ever touched it. How many times--?
I'm sitting across from you, you can't hear it?
he never drank water!
that means he doesn't drink. I got it.
you asked me, I told you. Now I'm telling you some more.
occasionally, maybe, he had some water.
he never drank water.
so he didn't Iike it.
he didn't Iike water. -How many times...?
Hymie, Gabriel, Jules.
are aunts kids before they become aunts?
everybody's a kid before they become an aunt.
they are? I thought they just popped out.
I've been thinking about it.
it's a good time we open our own business.
open our own business? What, are you kidding?
think of the risk involved.
we got good routes. Why should we gamble?
it's perfect. We got built-in customers.
we open our own place. We keep the routes, but switch people to us.
we sell the same goods, except the money goes in our pockets.
you don't think Simmons will sit still?
we open our own place, he'II put someone on our routes.
we'II hold on to the customers. They Iike us, trust us.
we won't hold on to everybody. We'II Iose customers.
this is Iess dollars, and we got to find new customers.
the war is over, right?
there's Iots of people with Iots of money. It's a good time to gamble.
dessert!
I hear dessert?
I hear dessert.
dessert.
bring me dessert.
the kids aren't having dessert?
my grandmother is grandmother to me, but she's not grandmother to Teddy.
Yes, right. -Then what is she?
she's Teddy's great-aunt.
there are aunts and great-aunts?
what's the difference between a regular aunt and a great-aunt?
they're older. That's the difference.
it's not because they're older.
because then someday, all aunts would be great-aunts.
but why are great-aunts just called great-aunts?
why not "good aunts" or "fantastic aunts" or "terrible aunts"?
no. It doesn't have anything to do with what kind of person they are.
it's got to do with great. You know, they're great, older.
what about those red ants that crawl around and bite you?
no, no, no. That's A-N-T.
ant.
what's a first cousin, twice removed?
I have absolutely no idea.
I'm going selling with my dad today.
you're not going to school?
Christmas holidays. No school.
Christmas holiday.
keep your nose clean. -Yeah.
how come you didn't become a wallpaper hanger Iike Sam?
well, Sam always had this idea...
...that doing manual Iabor had no dignity, but selling...
selling was security," he said.
no matter where you are or what you're selling...
...you can always make a Iiving.
can you sell anything? -Anything. I can sell anything.
see, it's all a question of being able to talk to people.
the product? It doesn't make any difference.
you're selling yourself.
can you sell model trains?
as many as they can make. -can you sell toothbrushes?
to as many people as have teeth.
quick! See that car? What car is that?
chrysler!
the one over there on the right?
Nash! -pretty good.
give me your money.
what's that? -Give me your money.
are you kidding me?
no, I'm not kidding you. Give me your money.
what, are you robbing me? With all these houses around?
Yeah, I'm robbing you.
get help.
I can't play.
I can't play.
I never learned to play the piano.
I never learned.
I said, I never Iearned.
Jules!
I can't. I can't play the piano.
I can't play.
no, I can't. I can't play the piano.
see!
he can't play, but he can Iearn!
I can't play.
that's the problem with collecting.
I know that's got to be a problem with collecting.
it's unheard of.
when you have lots of money...
it's unheard of to stab somebody and take the money.
I never heard of it.
I don't want to know about it. Not Iike in the old days.
when they know you got Iots of money, somebody wants the money.
we know that.
we know that. But who wants it?
it's not Iike it used to be! A man can't walk in the street?
never, never, never. It's the money that's the problem.
you're right. -Somebody tries to kill
somebody tries to kill my boy just for money.
that's not good. That's not good! -It's the money.
it's not good. -No good.
money, money, money, that's it.
that's the whole problem. Money. -Money.
when I was a Iittle younger than you...
I used to think the world was made up of big people and Iittle people.
and that's the way it would always stay.
and then I always wondered why sinks were too high.
you had to climb up to wash your face. cupboards, too high.
the hole in the toilet was too big.
nothing was made for us.
it's just a world of big people and Iittle people.
you never got any older and nobody ever died.
Michael!
Michael.
I talked to the doctor. Your father's gonna be all right.
there, you got it? -Yeah, yeah. Hold it.
what is it? What is it?
what could it be? It's so big.
it's a holiday gift. -What is it?
what is it? What is it?
it's a surprise. Wait and see.
the family circle voted and decided to get you a holiday get-well gift.
for me?
Oh, you didn't! You didn't!
so, what is this?
a television.
that's television. You can only watch for so Iong.
to me, it doesn't have what a radio has.
Yes, it does.
anybody want coffee?
Yes.
nice picture, huh?
beautiful picture.
never happened.
in the old country, never heard of stabbing someone to take their money.
never happened.
you're right. But the government would kill you.
would take your money, your property, whatever you had.
you know what you have to do? Be Iike in Westerns.
have a stagecoach and the shotgun when you collect.
that's what they had in the Wild West, because of outlaws.
Yeah, that's what you need. There's always robbers.
what was the movie we saw with the stagecoach? A very good movie.
stagecoach. -The movie had a stagecoach.
stagecoach. -Very active movie.
John Wayne, he was an outlaw but was not an outlaw.
what was the movie called with the stagecoach?
stagecoach.
that's what I'm saying, with the stagecoach.
stagecoach. -Stagecoach?
I saw a nice Iittle shop off Helen's Market on the southeast corner.
supposing we do do this, what are we selling? Same things we sell now?
Yeah, only for Iess than running the routes.
pots and pans?
pots, pans, vacuum cleaners, everything.
the time is right we get out on our own.
we don't have enough money. Now is not right.
Ann, please. -AII right.
the problem is, Jules, we never have privacy.
everybody's on top of everybody. We need our own place.
and we'II get it. But Izzy's right.
this is the time for us to use our savings for our own business.
we can get off the street and try to make a go of it.
well, I know that's the best thing.
I just can't promise I'm gonna remain sane.
you put on a Iittle sweater.
Yeah, be sure to take small steps. There's a Iittle wind.
Michael! Forgot your Iunch money.
toss it.
Ann! Do we Ieave at 1 0: 30?
Yeah, that'II be fine! I have to be back at 1: 00.
I have to go to the doctor's with Jules.
you're not driving, are you?
no, I'm still taking the Iessons. -Oh, thank God.
can" is whether you're capable of doing something.
may" is asking for permission.
Yes, Michael? -can I go to the bathroom?
Michael, do you want to repeat that question?
Oh, no, I'm going to be made an example of.
Michael.
I said, "can I go to the bathroom?
you can, but you may not.
well, can I or can't I?
I don't think you've been paying attention, have you, Michael Kaye?
Yes, I have.
so how would you rephrase the question?
can I please go to the bathroom?
children.
michael Kaye, why don't you just spend some time in the hallway...
...until you've Iearned the difference between "can" and "may.
when you've Iearned the difference, then you may come back in.
I have to go to the bathroom, but I'm afraid to ask.
now, does anyone know the difference between "can" and "may"?
young man, have you Iearned the difference between "may" and "can"?
not yet.
you stay out there until you've Iearned the difference.
Yes, Mrs. parkes.
well? Are you ready to rejoin the class, Michael?
Yes, Mrs. parkes.
and what's the difference between "may" and "can"?
give me a Iittle more time.
young man, what are you doing in the hallway?
learning the difference between "may" and "can.
how Iong do you think it would take?
Hello?
is this Mr. Kaye?
his father, Mr. Krichinsky.
no, he's at the doctor's, but he's fine. Who is this?
this is Mr. Dunn, the principal of Michael's school.
we seem to have a problem.
is he sick?
we seem to have a problem between "may" and "can.
what's the problem?
that's the Iesson they were Iearning.
michael asked if he could go to the bathroom.
he said, "can I go to the bathroom?
the teacher said, "You can, but you may not.
what's the problem? He asked to go to the bathroom.
he asked, but he asked incorrectly.
did he raise his hand? -Yes, he did.
but the point is, it was a Iesson about "may" and "can.
okay, it's fine with me. So, what's the problem?
he asked, "can I go to the bathroom?
the teacher said, "You can, but you may not.
that's confusing to the kid, because you're saying, "You can..."
...and then you say, "You can, but you can't.
you don't understand the subtleties of the English Ianguage, Mr. Krichinsky.
this English, it's very difficult.
I never realized how difficult English is.
may" or "can." You can, but you may not.
we've come a Iong way.
in the old days, if you had to pee, you peed on a tree.
there's no "may" or "can." That's progress for you.
Oh, my God.
hon?
I got it.
the store...
...televisions.
wall-to-wall televisions.
we'II sell more of them. How will we sell more of them?
we'II sell them cheaper.
televisions, televisions, from one end of the shop to the other.
nothing but televisions.
I think something's about to happen.
seems Iike the humming's getting Iess.
that's when something's about to happen.
seems Iike it's humming the same hum to me.
you better hope they start getting some more interesting programs.
see, I told you something was going to happen.
it's Howdy Doody.
we're getting ahead of ourselves with this television.
why don't we add some Iinoleums, toasters, pots and pans, brooms.
get a Iittle foot traffic in here, you know?
maybe that'II help.
why are they not coming in here?
electronic equipment!
here's adventure!
and now let's return to Westinghouse Studio One.
and Letter from cairo.
fighting for law and order, captain...
here's adventure.
here's romance.
Mr. I-magination
the Cisco Kid.
Henry Aldrich! -Coming, Mother.
the Colgate Comedy Hour.
say the secret word for $1 00.
it's a common word for something you find around the house.
well, well, well. Good evening.
it is wednesday night again, and I'm back on television.
your Hit Parade.
time now to enjoy What's My Line?
the George Burns and Gracie AIIen Show.
well, what does it mean? -What?
what does it mean, the suburbs? -It's just a nicer place to Iive.
that's what it means? A nicer place?
Yes, it's nicer. It's got Iawns and big trees.
uncle Izzy and Teddy and everyone, they'II be there too?
in one house in the suburbs?
God, please be careful! It's a very old piece.
Yes, ma'am. We've got it. -Huh? In one house?
no, Michael, it's gonna be the same.
your grandparents will Iive in our house.
we'II all Iive near each other. please don't distract me.
it's gonna rain, I got furniture in the street, I'm gonna panic.
aunt Dottie, Aunt Dottie! Is this a good thing that's happening?
what?
is this a good thing, going to the suburbs?
am I gonna Iike it there? -You kids are gonna Iove it.
we've been here forever.
we're even gonna have to go to a new school.
you ever been in the suburbs?
I never even heard of the suburbs until this thing happened.
wait a minute. Where you running with that?
wait a minute. -Ma, they'II wrap it.
no, no. We take this in the car. -It'II be wrapped.
no, no. We take it in the car.
the truck hits a bump, anything could happen.
okay, we're all set.
I remember Michael Iearned how to walk right here.
held on to the sofa, and he took his first steps.
he went right to your room.
Yeah, I remember. What was he? A year old?
no, no, not a year.
nine months.
held the sofa, and he took his first steps.
nine months.
what's wrong, pop?
I don't know, I don't know.
I get nervous about making a change.
what are you talking about? You came to America.
we're just going to the suburbs.
I came to America in 1914...
...but I was a young man.
Oh, come on, Dad.
what about the house? You saw the house.
forest park area. It's beautiful.
we're gonna have more room for the whole family.
we're getting farther and farther away from Avalon.
I think I'm getting too old for change.
bill, are you hurt? -Not a bit. Cut me loose.
no, Sam, don't feed the dog from the table.
he Iikes meat.
don't give him big pieces. He has a small throat.
what's wrong with the green beans? -I don't Iike green beans.
since when you don't Iike green beans?
never. I never eat green beans.
I cannot believe we argue over the dog and the green beans every meal.
green beans and the dog. Like it's the first time.
constantly you argue about the same thing.
it's not an argument, it's dinner talk.
dad, this goes on all the time.
whether it's green beans or feeding Nimo,constantly you two have a problem at dinner.
constantly? -Yeah. How about drinks?
mom says you can't mix drinks.
the mixes he makes is not a good drink.
let's not get into the drinks thing now.
what are you talking about? I take the juice from the pears...
...mix it with coca-cola. It's a good drink.
Oh, please. You're going to make me sick with this.
Sam, I said don't feed the dog from the table.
Oh, my God.
we're thinking of keeping the store open a couple nights until 9.
do you have to?
if we want to stay competitive. The other shops stay open Iater.
he's gonna choke to death.
one night we Iook under the table, the dog will be dead.
I spoke to Izzy about the family meeting that's supposed to be here.
some of the brothers feel it's too far to go.
too far?
how far can it be? They get on Rogers over the Liberty Heights.
we know how to go.
why Rogers? You take Greenspring. There's no Iight.
it's a bottleneck.
it's not. -It is.
it's not!
it's a bottleneck. I say you take Rogers.
to go to Rogers, he's got to go up park circle. Why Rogers?
the question is not which way they'II come. They think it is too far.
what do you want? You want me to tell them to move out?
I don't want you to tell them to move out.
I just was expressing a feeling that maybe, you know...
...you can get them their own place and chip in with the rent.
their own place? Where would the money come from?
I don't have the money yet. They don't either.
I know, I just feel...
...there's always somebody watching over me.
every time I do something, I feel Iike somebody's thinking that they could do it better.
what? I don't know.
I put something down, I Iike how it Iooks on the coffee table...
...I come back and it's moved.
you want me to talk to her?
I'd Iike to put something down, and have it there when I return.
do you want me to talk to her? I will.
I'II talk to her again and again, but it doesn't do any good.
you know her. She's Iike an enigma.
I feel Iike I'm still with my mom and dad.
I'd Iike to feel Iike this is my home. Feel Iike the mom in my own house.
I understand. I understand that.
I go out and buy what I consider to be an attractive outfit.
I come home, "No, it's too tight here. The material's not becoming to you.
it Iooks too heavy for summer." Or whatever it is.
she speaks her mind. She's got opinions.
I'd Iike to feel good about what I buy for my house or myself.
don't Iet her make you feel bad.
how can I help it?
put her in her place. -Right.
you gotta do that sometimes.
I don't know. -You gotta put her in her place.
I just would Iike to feel Iike I Iive in my house.
you do. You Iive here.
what do you want from me? I don't know what to do.
I know. I'm justtalking.
I got it!
Hi, Eva.
Hi, Nimo. -Where's your mother?
she's in the dining room.
come on, Iet's play a game. Got it.
you're not going to believe this.
I got a call.
american Red cross. My brother's alive in Europe.
what?
I can't believe it. I have to sit down.
I need something to drink. I ran to get here.
I'II get you some Iemonade.
Oh, it's too sweet. Not too sweet.
my heart. My heart is running.
so, Ma, what happened?
well, I don't know exactly.
he was in a concentration camp.
he Iived through the concentration camp.
they found him, but I don't know.
I don't know how he Iived through it. I don't know.
I never saw him. I heard about him from Ietters.
when I came to this country, he wasn't born.
and when he was old enough to come...
...he wouldn't Ieave my father.
and then the war started.
so where is your brother now?
I don't know. With refugees.
but now they found me...
...they make plans for him to come to America.
it's 4-1.
and after the concentration camp...
...he's put in a camp with the displaced people.
now he says he has a sister in Baltimore...
...but he can't remember my married name: Krichinsky.
doesn't have his Ietters anymore. They were all destroyed.
he knows the name's Russian, not polish.
it's a Y, not an I, but he can't remember the name.
I cannot imagine having a brother I've never seen.
never seen.
thought was dead.
aII right, Michael. Give me your best shot.
that's an out.
Oh, my God.
bees!
bees!
bees! Bees! Bees!
stand still! You're supposed to stand still!
run, run!
bees! Bees! Bees!
Oh, my God!
get the hose!
run, Michael!
put your hands over your eyes. Don't Iet them get in your eyes.
he's not allergic to the bees, so there's no real problem.
he's just gonna be a Iittle uncomfortable for a while.
I hate the suburbs.
I'm surprised your mother-in-Iaw didn't come along with you today.
she refuses to get in the car with me.
she's never been in a car when a woman drives.
jump!
the election of a new family-circle president will take place three weeks from Sunday.
so we have to make some serious decision-making.
it's Iike a furnace in here. Like a furnace.
that concludes old business.
I make a proposal that we take the next meeting at Frock's Farm.
very good idea. -I'm with you.
a very good idea.
it's cooler. We won't suffocate to death.
this is a family-circle meeting, not an outing.
why not combine the two when it's this hot?
an outing and a family-circle meeting.
an outing is an outing, and a family circle is a family circle.
I'm dripping.
let's finish the meeting and that'II be it.
and that will be it. That will be it.
when Schulman was alive, we sat in the meeting.
the meeting finished. Then we Ieft.
it was hot, it was cold, it was snow...
...it was rain. We sat and we had a meeting.
if we don't want to meet because it's hot, Iet's not meet.
do not meet. -No one said not to meet.
nobody said not to meet.
it's a furnace.
we need to decide how much money we'II give to our charity this year.
this is a heat wave.
it was hotter at Avalon.
we had a meeting and it was so hot you couldn't stand up.
what are you talking about? Aunt Molly fainted.
still, we had the meeting.
last year we gave-- Just Iet me have a Iook.
we gave to six charities.
an elephant just went by the window.
what?
it's the heat. You're hallucinating.
then the heat made me see another elephant, because another is going by.
the circus! The circus!
the circus!
the circus!
Oh, Iook at this!
they must be going through here to get to the tent site.
what tent? -They have a tent at Edmondson Avenue.
wow, Iook at the circus, Mom!
the circus is coming.
Yeah! Yeah!
do you got everything?
you'II waste the battery.
and remember, you stay with Sam. -Okay.
don't wander off around the reservoir without him, understand?
we know. We know.
later, I'II make you breakfast.
in the old days, it used to be hotter in the summertime.
did I tell you my father never drank water in America?
the whole time he was alive, he never drank water in America.
what did he drink? coca-cola?
whiskey.
if he didn't drink whiskey, mineral water.
but he never drank from the faucet.
Why?
he had the old ways. You see, we drank from a well.
spring water in the old country. And he said:
water that comes through a pipe under the city can't be good water.
can't be good for you.
he was a very stubborn man.
and we never could convince him otherwise.
your grandmother is a stubborn woman.
we know.
we know.
Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael.
I came to America in 1914.
and when I came to Baltimore...
...it was the most beautiful place you ever saw.
we know that story, Sam. can you tell us another one?
Yeah, wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
did I tell you I used to own a nightclub?
you used to own a nightclub?
Yeah, yeah. Not a big nightclub.
a small place on Iower pennsylvania Avenue.
it had a bar and a dance floor.
you went off and got married?
you see, we didn't plan to get married.
they decided to get married. We were taking them to get married.
we were getting married. Jules has the car, so he gave us a ride.
because you needed a ride, my son is married?
no, well, we sort of got caught up in the moment.
Yes, it was very... Well, you know.
we were gonna marry sooner or Iater.
sooner or Iater? -We got a deal too.
the justice of the peace charges $1 0 a couple.
I got him down to $1 5 for the whole thing.
it's wonderful. A bargain wedding.
you save $5 by getting married. I am so pleased.
come on, Dad. Be happy for us.
do you Iove my boy?
Yes, I do, very much.
good. Because that's one young man that's crazy about you.
kiss the bride. Let me see you kiss the bride.
Izzy, kiss your bride.
that's it, that's it, that's it!
dad, if it's all right, she's gonna sleep at the house tonight.
where is that marriage certificate? Let me see it.
let me see it. -Here.
I don't want any hanky-panky going on in my house.
who's this? Who's this Jules Kaye here?
that's me, Dad.
I changed my name.
me too. I changed mine to Kirk.
it's easier to say than Krichinsky. Kirk. It's better.
who said names are supposed to be easy to say?
what are you, a candy bar?
you got a name: Krichinsky. It's a name.
Kaye. Kirk.
two cousins, different names.
how can this be a family when the father is called Sam Krichinsky...
...his son is called Jules Kaye and his first cousin is Izzy Kirk.
this is a family, goddamn it! Krichinsky is the name of the family!
it's not Kaye! It's not Kirk! It's Krichinsky!
it's Krichinsky.
we argued and argued.
then the way things are in Iife, you stop arguing.
it's your Iife. You're gonna have to Iive it.
what a celebration. And we celebrated that night.
it wasn't your ordinary family celebration.
it was the best wedding I ever went to.
it's nice.
it's easy to sleep when you have a breeze. It's easy to sleep.
I'm getting nervous. Too much expansion.
we bought out that store and that one. we got all this merchandise.
nothing's ready, we got no customers. Money's going out, not coming in.
I'm getting a Iittle nervous. -You're not the only one.
I've talked to some of the people around here in the marketplace...
...and I'm not sure anyone knows what this "discount" is.
I don't know whether it means anything to anybody.
it's not Iike we invented the word.
I didn't say that, but it doesn't mean anything.
what are you saying?
I'm saying we need to be more clear.
we need a catchy slogan or something. -More clear than discount?
more clear than discount. Something that
aII right. You want a catchy slogan? How about:
guaranteed Iowest prices in town.
that's good.
a Iittle higher! Higher!
higher! A Iittle higher!
what if someone buys and it's cheaper?
cheaper than they guaranteed is the Iower price. What do you do then?
Jules, what happens if somebody buys cheaper than what you sell?
good question. What if they get it cheaper someplace else since we guarantee the Iowest prices in town?
find somewhere else cheaper, then we'II match it at that price.
that's good. We'II match it!
they'II match it? What does that mean?
whatever the guy buys somewhere else he can get here for the same price.
what the hell does he need to do that for?
he bought it, and then they guarantee they'II give him the same price.
that makes no sense. He's gotta take it back to the shop...
...and then get it here? -Why wouldn't that make sense?
they'd guarantee it? -Yes.
they'd guarantee it. Maybe make it Iower.
how much Iower? Because if it's a nickel Iower...
...I won't take it all the way back to get it here for a nickel Iess.
a Iittle higher!
can we just put up the sign?
is it me, or does it Iook a Iittle Iow?
no, it's still Iow. It's Iow.
I gotta go to the doctor's, then pick up the kids from the movie around 4.
the movies? -Yeah.
from 1 0 in the morning to 4? What do they watch, 9 movies?
you're going to the doctor's?
just a checkup. What time will you be home?
I'II be home probably around 7.
can you see if my mother wants to go back with you? please?
what are they doing? They're arguing again. Arguing again.
you want to ride back with me?
with you?
Yeah.
no, I think it's still too soon.
I've been driving for six months. -No, still too soon.
you gotta go all the way uptown. Lot of turns to make. It's too soon.
you'II have to wait till 7.00. That's when Jules is going home.
I'II take a streetcar. It's on tracks.
you take the 32 and you're there.
aII right. Fine.
higher!
I cannot believe your mother. -She's not going with you?
no, I haven't been driving Iong enough for her.
what's that?
I wonder how Iong it'II be until we get our own rocket suits.
it'II be great.
we'II be able to rocket to school and rocket back home.
it will be great.
I'd Iove to see my grandmother rocketing to the store to get bread.
go, Rocket Man!
Yeah!
Hi, will you fill her up? I'm going to get my kids.
sure. -I'II be right back.
Oh, I can't see.
it's because you've been sitting in a dark movie theater all afternoon.
I can't believe this. wait a minute. wait.
what are you saying? That it's my fault?
I'm not saying it's your fault.
you say it Iike it's my fault that the streetcar smashed my car.
I'm not saying it's your fault. No, you took the car and it got hit.
and I could have been sitting in it. -You don't understand.
you make it sound as if I'm responsible, as if it's my fault.
I've been in this country 40 years.
I've never seen a streetcar jump the track and hit a car.
am I crazy, or does it sound Iike it's my fault?
you're being sensitive. She's not blaming you.
you're not blaming her, are you? -No, no, I'm not blaming her.
what I'm saying is, they should get rid of the streetcars.
they got buses. Why do they need streetcars?
the tracks are too slippery.
I don't even Iike Sam to drive in the rain.
the tracks is dangerous. When it gets wet, it gets too slippery.
do you know anyone whose car got hit by a streetcar off its tracks?
it's a first.
to think I could've been sitting in that car.
thank God I didn't get into that machine.
I cannot believe this conversation.
can we put the streetcar talk to rest?
we're Iucky it was nothing serious. That's the end of it.
you should've seen it, Dad. It was just Iike the cliffhangers.
Michael!
eiien Ferguson. -What?
eiien Ferguson's car got hit by a streetcar.
it wasn't a streetcar. It was a train.
off of Saratoga. Freight train. It wasn't a streetcar.
it wasn't a streetcar? -It was a train.
do you know where my coat is?
in the back closet. It was too crowded.
never has there been a streetcar jumped its tracks.
now, a train has jumped its tracks, but never a streetcar.
I circulated over 10, 000 fliers for the opening of the new store, Dad.
I never believed in fliers.
if people don't pay for something, they won't bother reading it.
the newspaper you pay for, then you read an ad.
let's hope you're wrong, because we can't afford newspaper ads.
you can gamble, you're young. You make mistakes, you can always start again.
see what Solomon did. He could have stayed in the shoe business...
...but he gambled. Today, he's got one of Baltimore's biggest department stores.
that is true. -I can't find the coat.
Oh, God. I sent it to the cleaners.
dad, where's the keys to your car?
here.
you ready, hon?
I'm just putting on my coat.
Michael, be good. -I will.
don't be Iate.
and it's true with Solomon.
I'm about this far away from Iosing my mind.
thank you.
want pictures here? pictures?
pictures? pictures?
pictures? -No, thank you.
pictures here? AII right.
pictures here?
can I get a picture?
aII right. come on. Everybody smile.
don't Iaugh.
I'm not Iaughing.
Yes, you are. I can see it.
miss? Miss? Let's do it again.
what do you want? -My eyes weren't open.
they were fine. What's your problem?
I'm getting nervous.
you? You getting nervous?
he makes me nervous.
we're back to the business again.
he started it.
what? -No, no, no.
maybe the customers won't show.
we're expanding. We're getting in over-- You getting this?
it was a genuine concern, and it remains a genuine concern.
genuine concern? That I Iike.
genuine concern. Very nice phrase.
I have to admit, he tends to be on the conservative side.
if this expansion doesn't go over...
...we're out of the suburbs and back into row houses, huh?
that's a genuine concern.
we'II toast to genuine concerns. It's been acknowledged.
no, Iet's toast to the suburbs, shall we?
better.
honey, don't count. Just...
am I doing good?
you're doing wonderful. -Thank you.
who would've thought that this bargain marriage would have Iasted this Iong?
you know, I didn't get a chance to tell you before, but...
but what?
what? -I'm pregnant.
you're what?
I am pregnant. I'm pregnant.
you're kidding? -No, I am not kidding.
you have great news and you wait until now to tell me?
I would've told you sooner, but the streetcar discussion got in the way.
it didn't seem Iike the proper time to get in the fact that I'm pregnant again.
let's face it, the streetcar story was all-consuming.
honey, this is great news.
let's do that promenade thing.
please. It's bad enough over there.
what is this?
what is this?
there's a Iot of people for something.
this is us.
this is for us!
discount is here. -Oh, this is good.
Smeagol!
I've got one!
I've got a fish, Smeag. Smeagol!
pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.
Deagol!
Deagol?
Deagol.
give us that, Deagol, my love.
Why?
because...
...It's my birthday and I wants it.
my precious.
they cursed us.
murderer.
murderer" they called us."
they cursed us and drove us away.
Gollum.
Gollum.
Gollum.
and we wept, precious.
we wept to be so alone.
and cool So nice for feed.
and we only wish to catch a fish.
so juicy sweet.
and we forgot the taste of bread...
the sound of trees...
the softness of the wind.
we even forgot our own name.
my precious.
wake up!
wake up!
wake up, sleepies.
we must go, yes.
we must go at once.
haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?
I've gone and had too much.
must be getting late.
no.
it isn't.
it isn't midday yet.
the days are growing darker.
come on!
must go! No time!
not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.
no time to lose, silly.
here.
what about you?
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Leastways, not for lembas bread.
Sam.
all right.
we don't have that much left.
we have to be careful or we're going to run out.
you go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.
I've rationed it.
there should be enough.
for what?
the journey home.
come, Hobbitses.
very close now.
very close to Mordor.
no safe places here.
hurry.
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon...after a hard day's work.
only, you've never done a hard day's work.
welcome, my lords...
to Isengard!
you young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on...
and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!
we are sitting on a field of victory...
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
the salted pork is particularly good.
salted pork?
Hobbits. - We're under orders from Treebeard...
who's taken over management of Isengard.
young Master Gandalf.
I'm glad you've come.
I can master wood and water, stock and stone .
but there is a wizard to manage here...
Iocked in his tower.
and there Saruman must remain under your guard, Treebeard.
well, let's just have his head and be done with it.
no.
he has no power anymore.
the filth of Saruman...
is washing away.
trees will come back to live here.
young trees.
wild trees. - Pippin!
bless my bark!
Peregrin Took!
I'll take that, my lad.
quickly, now.
tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country.
hail the victorious dead.
Hail!
I am happy for you.
he is an honorable man.
you are both honorable men.
it was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.
don't listen to me.
you are young.
and tonight is for you.
Oh, you can search far and wide. You can drink the whole town dry
but you'll never find a beer so brown.
as the one we drink in our hometown.
you can drink your fancy ales. You can drink 'em by the flagon
but the only brew for the brave and true,
comes from The Green Dragon!
thank you! I win!
no news of Frodo?
no word. Nothing.
we have time.
every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.
do we know that?
what does your heart tell you?
that Frodo is alive.
Yes.
Yes, he's alive.
too risky. Too risky.
thieves.
they stole it from us.
kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.
quiet! Mustn't wake them.
mustn't ruin it now.
but they knows.
they knows.
they suspects us.
what's it saying, my precious, my love?
is Smeagol losing his nerve?
no. Not.
never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.
Smeagol wants to see them dead.
and we will.
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.
it's ours!
ours!
we must get the precious. We must get it back.
patience! Patience, my love.
first we must lead them to her.
we lead them to the Winding Stair.
Yes, the stairs. And then?
up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...
until we come to the tunnel.
and when they go in...
there's no coming out.
she's always hungry.
she always needs to feed.
she must eat.
all she gets is filthy Orcses.
and they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?
no.
not very nice at all, my love.
she hungers for sweeter meats.
Hobbit meat.
and when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes...
then we will find it.
and take it for me!
for us.
Yes. We meant "for us."
Gollum. Gollum.
the precious will be ours...
once the Hobbitses are dead!
you treacherous little toad!
No! No! Master!
no, Sam! Leave him alone!
I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.
he's a horrid, fat Hobbit...
who hates Smeagol...
and who makes up nasty lies.
you miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
Sam!
call me a liar? You're a liar!
you scare him off, we're lost! - I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.
I won't wait around for him to kill us! - I'm not sending him away.
you don't see it, do you?
he's a villain.
we can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide.
I need you on my side.
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.
I know, Sam. I know.
trust me.
come, Smeagol.
the stars are veiled.
something stirs in the east.
a sleepless malice.
the Eye of the enemy is moving.
what are you doing?
Pippin!
Pippin?
Pippin.
what, are you mad? - I just want to look at it.
just one more time.
put it back.
Pippin.
No!
Pippin.
he is here.
I see you.
Pippin!
help! Gandalf, help!
someone help him!
Pippin!
fool of a Took!
look at me.
Gandalf, forgive me.
look at me.
what did you see?
a tree.
there was a white tree...
in a courtyard of stone.
it was dead.
the city was burning.
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?
I saw...
I saw him.
I could hear his voice in my head.
and what did you tell him?
speak!
he asked me my name. I didn't answer.
he hurt me.
what did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
there was no lie in Pippin's eyes.
a fool...
but an honest fool he remains.
he told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
we've been strangely fortunate.
Pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan.
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.
his defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.
he knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.
men are not as weak as he supposed.
there is still enough courage, strength to challenge him.
Sauron fears this.
he will not risk the peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one banner.
he will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...
before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.
if the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war.
tell me...
why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
what do we owe Gondor?
I will go. - No!
they must be warned. - They will be.
you must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
follow the river and look to the black ships.
understand this:
things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
I ride for Minas Tirith...
and I won't be going alone.
of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst.
Hurry! Hurry!
where are we going?
why did you look?
why do you always have to look?
I don't know. I can't help it. - You never can.
I'm sorry, all right?
I won't do it again. - Don't you understand?
the enemy thinks you have the Ring.
he's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here.
and you...? You're coming with me?
merry?
come on.
how far is Minas Tirith?
three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.
and you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
here.
something for the road.
the last of the Longbottom Leaf.
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.
but... But we'll see each other soon.
won't we? - I don't know.
I don't know what's going to happen.
merry. - Run, Shadowfax.
show us the meaning of haste.
merry!
merry!
take her by the safest road.
a ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.
it waits to carry her across the sea.
the last journey of Arwen Undomiel.
there is nothing for you here...
only death.
lady Arwen...
we cannot delay.
my lady!
tell me what you have seen. - Arwen.
you have the gift of foresight.
what did you see?
I looked into your future, and I saw death.
but there is also life.
you saw there was a child. You saw my son.
that future is almost gone.
but it is not lost.
nothing is certain.
some things are certain.
if I leave him now...
I will regret it forever.
it is time.
from the ashes a fire shall be woken.
a light from the shadow shall spring.
renewed shall be blade that was broken.
the crownless again shall be king.
reforge the sword.
your hands are cold.
the life of the Eldar is leaving you.
this was my choice.
whether by your will or not...
there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
we've just passed into the realm of Gondor.
Minas Tirith.
city of kings.
make way!
it's the tree.
Gandalf. Gandalf.
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.
the tree of the king.
lord Denethor, however, is not king.
he is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.
now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.
to give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise.
and do not mention Frodo or the Ring.
and say nothing of Aragorn either.
I n fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.
hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, lord and steward of Gondor.
I come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel.
perhaps you come to explain this.
perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.
Boromir died to save us...
my kinsman and me.
he fell defending us from many foes. - Pippin.
I offer you my service, such as it is...
in payment of this debt.
get up.
my lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...
but it is not now.
war is coming.
the enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor's armies?
you still have friends. You are not alone in this fight.
send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.
you think you are wise, Mithrandir.
yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.
do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?
I have seen more than you know.
with your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor.
and with your right you'd seek to supplant me.
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
and I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North...
last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.
authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward.
the rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.
come.
so I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.
I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting.
do they? - You're in the service of the steward now.
you're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took, guard of the Citadel.
it's so quiet.
it's the deep breath before the plunge.
I don't want to be in a battle...
but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.
is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?
there never was much hope.
just a fool's hope.
our enemy is ready.
his full strength's gathered.
not only Orcs, but Men as well.
legions of Haradrim from the south...
mercenaries from the coast.
all will answer Mordor's call.
come on.
this will be the end of Gondor as we know it.
here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.
if the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...
...the last defense of this city will be gone.
but we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something.
Gandalf?
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...
the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.
the one they say no living man can kill.
the Witch-king of Angmar.
you've met him before.
he stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.
he is the lord of the Nazgul...
the greatest of the Nine.
Minas Morgul is his lair.
the Dead City.
very nasty place. Full of enemies.
quick. Quick.
they will see. They will see.
come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.
the way into Mordor.
the secret stair.
climb.
no, Mr. Frodo! - Not that way!
what's it doing? - No.
they're calling me. - No.
hide! Hide!
I can feel his blade.
we come to it at last.
the great battle of our time.
come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.
the board is set.
the pieces are moving.
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.
another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.
you must not fail me.
quiet.
to the river. Quick. Quick. - Go. Go.
come on.
faster.
draw swords.
hold! Hold!
what?
amon Din.
the beacon. The beacon of Amon Di n is lit.
hope is kindled.
the beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!
Gondor calls for aid.
and Rohan will answer.
muster the Rohirrim.
assemble the army at Dunharrow.
as many men as can be found. You have two days.
on the third, we ride for Gondor and war.
forward. - Very good, sir.
Gamling. - My lord.
make haste across the Riddermark.
summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.
I will.
will you ride with us? - Just to the encampment.
it's tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men.
the men have found their captain.
they will follow you into battle, even to death.
you have given us hope.
so it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...
the doom of our time will be decided.
now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.
now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!
Faramir!
we can't hold them. The city is lost.
tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.
Nazgul.
take cover!
Nazgul!
fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!
fall back!
retreat! Retreat! - Come on!
the age of Men is over.
the time of the Orc has come.
take cover!
take cover, my lord!
it's coming!
it's Mithrandir. - The White Rider!
pull!
