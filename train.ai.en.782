Linda? I am right behind you.
see you in an hour. Ah. You're in better spirits, huh?
it's an act.
I don't want Linda getting suspicious. Did you speak to your friend?
Yeah, about that, I didn't mean to get your hopes up, Danny.
look, I don't think that thing's a good idea.
what are you talking about, Mick? Why not?
he's not the kind of guy you want to be involved with.
well, who is he? Danny, just let me lend you the money.
no. Listen, it's not gonna come between us, okay? You know what?
I'll give it to you. No strings.
consider it a gift. Done.
so, I'm a charity case now, is that it? Danny, you got it all wrong.
do I?
sounds to me like you're saying that you're the fancy big shot and I'm the guy looking for a handout here.
that's not what I'm saying at all.
Mick, just introduce me to the guy.
let me figure it out for myself, okay? Make the connection.
look, I got into this jam on my own.
Danny, look at me.
we're not talking about hanging some drywall for some extra bucks.
you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, I do.
you're okay with that?
it's the only shot I got, Mick.
all right.
call you tomorrow. We'll sit down and talk.
okay? Okay.
okay, whatever he says, you make sure you get it on tape.
on tape? Whoa.
nobody said anything to me about wearing a wire. Well, he wants to meet in an hour.
we have no lead time to wire the place. It's too risky.
and so is me walking into the church with that thing stuck to my chest.
he's your friend. He trusts you.
he may look stupid, but he's actually pretty smart.
he's not smarter than you. You know how to play him.
besides, we'll be right around the corner.
one word from you, and we'll storm the place like it's Normandy.
normandy was a bloodbath. Not my best analogy.
but you got my word, we'll take care of you.
I'll take care of myself, thanks. Give me the wire.
what are we doing here, Mickey?
Christmas time.
I love coming to church this time of year.
right. Why, you got the creeps?
well, yeah, a little bit.
me and you here like this, it's a little creepy.
it looks... smaller, doesn't it?
I don't know. I'm here all the time. Looks the same to me.
I remember being... terrified coming in here as a kid.
really felt the eyes of God on you, didn't you?
Yeah. Yeah, tell me about it.
you, um... want to go get a slice?
no, in a minute. Let's talk.
we're gonna talk here?
no, not here. Up there.
up... there? What? Like old times.
when we were altar boys. But first...
the new millennium.
huh, Danny? Eyes and ears everywhere, and...
what we have to discuss today, best kept between friends.
Yeah. Of course.
thank you. Thanks.
what are you doing?
no offense, Danny, you're a cop.
And?
and... I would be stupid not to take precautions.
come on. You want to pat me down?
well, I don't want to.
I'm not wearing a wire, Mickey. Then you won't mind showing me.
since when is my word not good enough for you?
come on, Danny. Your word's good enough for me.
we're gonna be discussing third parties, and I'm afraid your word, not good enough for them.
so, may I?
of course.
all right, okay, let's talk.
what the hell happened? Why didn't we hear anything on the wire?
cause I took this damn thing off before I even walked in the door, that's why.
and it's a good thing. Otherwise, you'd be at a cop funeral right now.
you pulled the wire and still went through with the sit-down?
Yeah, and Mickey said enough to incriminate himself. That's great.
too bad it's of no use to us- it's your word against his.
you know they make apps for everything these days?
you recorded it on your phone? He took my phone before I sat down, but... I had a second phone stashed in my ankle holster, and I recorded every word. You happy?
nice work, Detective. Yeah, some victory. Whoo- hoo.
I'll tell you how to beat this thing.
ignore it. Tell every cop to go out there and do the job, like they've done before.
great idea. And open up each and every one to a lawsuit, Pop.
what they gonna do, sue 35, 000 cops?
nonsense.
let this mess crumble under its own weight.
and if it doesn't, you're carrying a mortgage, you're saving for your kid's college.
the legal fees alone would wipe you out.
pop, what kind of a PC orders his people to break the law?
the judge's rule was wrong. That's an opinion.
but the fact is the judge has ruled, and we have to live with it, like it or not.
well, I don't like it, and neither should you.
I didn't say I did.
so, as a cop, where do you come down on this?
as a cop?
professionals are valued for their instincts, their ability to react, whether you're a cop or an NFL quarterback.
I can think of no other profession where you're told to bench your talents, and then you're penalized if you don't.
honestly, this ruling makes the job ten times harder.
But? But I think the judge has a point.
I think Stop and Frisk is an effective instrument that started to be overused.
cops going too far with it. That's part of it.
there's something else?
a lot of cops started to get lazy.
a few years ago, Stop and Frisk was just one of many ways that we could get guns off the streets. It was a potent tool.
so potent that bosses started to encourage us to abandon all other means in favor of this one method.
so the shortcut became the favorite route.
and I'm the boss of those bosses.
didn't mean it like that. Sure, you did.
you're saying this falls on my shoulders.
and you're right.
Hey, Danny boy! Mickey.
what's the matter?
Oh, no, don't tell me you're betting again.
no betting, Mickey. No?
in fact, there was never any gambling trouble at all.
I'm not following.
it was a play, Mick. What are you telling me?
I'm telling you I got a recording of you offering me money for sensitive NYPD information.
Danny, listen to me. Some kind of joke, it's not funny.
it's no joke. It's real and it's happening, so do me a favor, get your hands out of your pockets, get 'em up in the air. Come on.
you framed me? Come on, Mick.
you framed me, Danny, your oldest friend?
you set me up?
turn around.
okay, okay.
give it up. Give it up!
I don't kill anybody.
Oh, so that's supposed to make what you do okay, hmm?
I'm just a businessman, Danny.
I'm good at making deals, that's all.
what kind of deals you making, huh, Mick?
hmm? Drugs, gambling, prostitution, what?
do you even hear yourself?! No, no, I don't do any of that stuff.
I'm not involved with any of that. I put people together.
I buy and sell companies, I move some money around.
that's it, okay? I got nothing to do with anybody getting hurt.
but they do get hurt!
and if it's not you, it's your associates, which makes you just as guilty!
don't you get that?!
what the hell happened to you, huh? Why did you do this?
I didn't know I was doing it, Danny.
I was just a young hotshot good at making deals.
these guys saw it, they paid me a premium to do the exact same thing on a larger scale with them.
by the time I realized who they were...
it's too late.
well... maybe it's not too late.
how bad is it? Ten years bad.
maybe 15.
unless you're willing to work with me.
don't even say it. You got to testify against them, Mick.
not possible.
you got to put these animals where they belong, behind bars.
Danny, you know.
I speak one word against the Vasquez family, and that's as good as me putting Connie and the boys in a body bag myself.
Mick, we'll protect you.
we'll put you and Connie and the boys in witness protection where you'll be safe!
at least you'll have a chance!
and then what?
Connie never sees her mother ever again?
my boys have to give up my name?
and become a couple of nobodies living in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah. Maybe you'd rather they just stare at you through six inches of Plexiglas for the next ten years, huh?
what?
my name is Charles Bryce.
I'm the attorney of record, and my client has nothing more to say.
that's how it's gonna be, Mick? Nothing to say?
not a word.
turn around.
get him out of here.
what?
feds are requesting a million dollars bail. A million dollars?
well, he just moved here. He's a flight risk.
and trust me, it's a good thing. Why is that?
Vasquez family put a hit out on Mickey. You got to be kidding me.
I knew this was a terrible idea. They think he's talking to us.
well, obviously, he's not talking. You just heard for yourself.
well, they don't know that. And they wouldn't believe it if we told them.
we can't help this guy 'cause he won't talk, and they want to whack him 'cause they think he is?
I know. You know? That's all you got to offer- you know?
I want two marshals on him at all times.
if he goes to take a leak, I want one of them flushing the...
it's already being taken care of. If he gets whacked, it's on me.
then I'm gonna be on you.
over there.
those three.
why are we here, Frank?
one of the boy in the ball cap and the blue jacket. You see him?
I do.
two cell phones going- one for calls, the other for texts.
I don't think he runs a hedge fund.
there's no law against carrying two cell phones, Frank.
no, there isn't.
but you see the way he keeps shifting his weight and tapping his hip?
okay. So?
well, a loaded pistol weighs about two pounds.
these guys don't use holsters, so it's just kind of loose weight with only the elastic in his waistband or a skinny belt to secure it. So that man's carrying a gun?
my 30-plus years doing police work says yes.
he is carrying a gun and therefore likely to be involved in dealing drugs.
given the neighborhood, probably crack.
so what are we going to do about it?
nothing.
Frank, I got it.
lesson over. If he's carrying a gun, someone needs to stop him.
well, what if I'm wrong?
what if it's just a pint of vodka he keeps checking?
but you say your experience tells you it's a gun.
it does.
but I am not infallible.
and he is black.
if I'm wrong and stop him, I open myself up to a lawsuit.
but if somebody makes a call, then it gives the police just cause to stop and question him.
that's right.
but unless and until it does, no cop who cares about his pension will go near him.
we're done here.
your medicine working yet?
Aw, Gramps.
I'm either sending my buddy to jail or to his grave.
they don't make medicine strong enough to deal with that.
you didn't do anything but your job. Right.
Mickey brought this on himself.
so why do I feel like a piece of crap then?
cause you cared for him.
Yeah. Well, sometimes I think I should've been a firefighter.
you just learning this is a thankless job?
what now, Sutton?
Mickey just made bail. How the hell did he do that?
it wasn't him.
a Vasquez soldier posted it for him.
Vasquez family just bailed Mickey out.
there's only one reason they'd want to spring him.
careful.
Connie, where's Mickey? What do you want?
I need to talk to Mickey. He's in jail, where you put him.
come on. You and I both know they bailed him out, so knock it off.
so what if they did?
that's what friends do.
you think they're his friends. They're not, Connie.
they think he talked. He didn't tell you a thing.
I know that, but they don't.
if they bailed him out, it's 'cause they think he sang and they're gonna hurt him.
I...
Connie, look at me.
you know I'm not lying. Where is he?
I don't... I don't know where he is.
I honestly don't.
he texted me a while ago, but it's just gibberish.
I think he pocket-dialed me.
it's in ob.
taking me under the bridge. I...
I love you.
what? I got to... I got to go.
this is Detective Reagan.
I'm gonna need a 10-85 forthwith.
no, no, no! You got it wrong.
you got it wrong! No!
no. No.
don't do this.
you got it wrong. You guys got it wrong.
I didn't do anything!
I'm begging you. Don't do this.
police! Drop it!
one in the chamber.
drop the gun!
learn how to count.
come on.
come on.
get this piece of crap out of here.
this is what's gonna happen.
you're gonna make a change, you're gonna set things right and then, maybe then,
I'll consider calling you a friend again.
I got to testify. Yeah, you got to testify.
I'll be there the whole time making sure you don't screw it up like you screwed up everything else. And after that?
after that, you start a new life with Connie and the boys.
I want to say something, but "thank you" doesn't seem like enough.
it's not enough.
come on.
let's go.
come on.
Ten-hut!
at ease.
there's a lot of talk around this precinct and throughout the department about Stop, Question and Frisk.
many of you believe that the judge's ruling is unfair, even dangerous.
here is my take on the ruling.
it is the law.
and because it is the law, we damn sure are gonna see that it is carried out.
now, I know that's not what many of you want to hear.
and that's fine.
you have a right to your opinion when you are off duty.
but when you come through those doors and you put on that uniform, best check those opinions in your locker.
the real truth about Stop, Question, and Frisk is that it is a highly effective measure.
and it has helped us take a whole lot of bad guys off the street.
but it is not the only tool on your belt.
and it is not something we are discarding altogether.
and I can tell you that the mayor gets that.
I need some help.
I need you to do the job you signed on to do.
I will give you clear guidelines so you can do that job.
and I will always have your back.
that is all.
Ten-hut!
when you were kids, did you know that Mr. Patrick was gonna turn out to be a criminal?
no, I didn't know that. We were just friends.
I knew. Oh, come on, Pop.
20/20 hindsight? Well, I did.
Mickey Patrick was a born felon.
come on, Gramps.
I didn't even how I was gonna turn out, much less anyone else.
none of us did.
you thought you might turn out sideways? No, I was an angel.
I'm talking about your Uncle Danny.
grandma always kept a little bail fund for Danny in a mayonnaise jar over the fridge.
no, she did not.
your dad was the type of guy that liked to know everyone else's moves before he decided on his own.
which is not a bad way to be, and handy for a cop.
Thanks.
if you can stop yourself from defining someone by their worst choices, you know, like your dad tries to do, then you'll be a better man.
I'm really loving this.
but if a guy commits a crime, isn't he a criminal?
for that act, yes. But that's not all he is.
uh, okay.
all right, Sean, what movie do we always watch this time of year?
a Christmas Carol. Okay, take Ebenezer Scrooge.
he starts out a decent fellow, then he gets cranky, then he gets downright mean, then he gets scared, and then he tries to bargain his way out, and then he ends up all jolly and generous.
so, Ebenezer Scrooge, good guy or bad guy?
good?
but he is bad through most of the story.
I say bad.
Yeah, and when you call someone a Scrooge, it means that they're cheap in a mean sort of way.
that's right. Yeah, but...
when you watch the movie, you end up liking him in the end.
also right. What you take away is up to you, makes you who you are in terms of how you look at other people.
and there was no bail fund.
you remember that envelope full of cash that Mom gave you on your 21st birthday?
Yeah. Had a couple hundred bucks in it. Bail fund.
no, no, no. Mom told me it was docked allowance from over the years.
yeah? Yes.
no. Bail fund.
I'm gonna see my little girl! - No!
you're not gonna get away with this, Frannie! You're not!
you are not coming in. Christopher! - I'm... I'm...
we've got an audience. Better call for backup.
12 David requesting 10-85. - No, no, not like this...
no emergency. We have a crowd at this location.
I want you to listen to me.
you're not gonna get away with this, Frannie!
you're not coming in! You're not... - Okay, okay. All right, hey, hey! Excuse me.
excuse me. Calm down. What's going on? What's the problem?
I'm just trying to see my daughter. - He's trying to take her away from me.
no, I'm not! - You okay, Mommy?
Alex, Alex, come to Daddy. Come to Daddy. - Whoa. Whoa. Come on, man.
do me a favor. Back up. Okay, tell me your name.
christopher Collins. I just want to talk to her.
okay, talk to me. Do-do you live here? - No, but I got rights.
who has legal custody of this child? - I do.
that doesn't mean you can keep her from me.
she's my kid, too. Okay. - What do we got?
we got a domestic.
maybe you can get Mr. Collins' side of the story, and we'll talk to her.
Hey, I didn't do anything wrong! - We didn't say you did.
I didn't do anything wrong. - We just want to talk to you.
okay, how did this all get started?
it's no big deal, okay? We can work this out ourselves.
get off me. - Hey, hey, hey, hey!
would you just get off?! - Hey, calm down!
Hey, I didn't do anything wrong, man! What the hell are you doing?!
you're going in for disorderly conduct. - I didn't do anything!
you're going in for disorderly conduct.
what the hell are you doing, man?! - They're hurting Daddy.
it's okay. There is no need for that. - Alex...
please. This is a private matter.
you made it a public matter when you brought it out on the street.
all you damn cops ever do is make things worse.
we respond, diffuse the situation, and we're the bad guys?
domestics are like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.
Yeah, I just feel bad for that little girl.
Yeah, she didn't win the lottery in the parent department.
Yeah. Know how that feels.
just got another letter from my dad yesterday.
he never gives up. Here you go.
maybe you should think about... writing him back.
trust me, that letter wouldn't make it past the prison censors.
I need some help back here!
call for a bus! - Hey, what the hell happened?
he had to take a leak.
I took his cuffs off, next thing I know, he took a swing at me.
did he bang his head? I- I don't know.
maybe he's on something. I finally got him to the ground.
then I realized he wasn't breathing.
Eddie, give me a time check. Hey, Christopher, stay with me.
come on, breathe. Christopher, breathe!
Hey, stay with me.
breathe. Chris, breathe, Chris.
and put a rush on that bus!
Yeah. I got it.
I want the UOR on my desk before end of tour.
I understand, and the M. E.'s cause of death as soon as they can.
I'll expect to hear from you, Dino.
what?
we got a death in custody. 12th precinct.
christopher Collins, age 34.
we're gonna have to hold a press conference. - I know that, Garrett.
comes with the job.
that went surprisingly well. - Not my first rodeo.
you should learn to take a compliment. - I'll put that on my bucket list.
commissioner? - As you were.
this press conference is over, folks. Thanks for your time.
will Officer Cutter be suspended?
officer Cutter's been placed on modified assignment while this incident is investigated.
but do you take it personally when a citizen in custody loses his life on your watch?
we stand proudly on this department's record of treating the public with professionalism and respect.
commissioner? Commissioner? - That said, any loss of life is tragic.
Mr. Collins' death will be fully investigated by this department and the district attorney's office.
what's your reaction to the selection of your daughter, Erin Reagan, to lead the D. A.'s investigation of this matter?
I have no comment on that.
what would you say to those who will call this a glaring conflict of interest?
my daughter is an accomplished prosecutor.
and you feel she could be objective about this, even when her father's professional reputation is at stake?
that is a question that should be addressed to her.
one more question. - Commissioner?
did you see Mr. Collins resist the officers?
he was upset.
but Christopher wasn't a violent person.
I see that he was arrested for assault three years ago?
that wasn't his fault.
some drunk jerks went after his brother in a bar, and Chris stepped in.
I see.
since you're obviously looking to blame the victim here.
I'll save you some time.
I've been busted twice for possession.
but I've been clean for over a year.
and you and Mr. Collins have a daughter?
she's seven. - And you never married?
what difference does that make?
I'm not making any judgments. I'm just trying to get the facts.
the facts are, me and Christopher were having an argument like people do.
next thing I know, he's getting thrown into a cop car.
two hours later, I get a phone call that he's dead.
did Mr.Collins have any medical conditions- asthma, heart problems?
you think he had a heart attack?
that crazy cop killed him.
did anybody see what happened?
I have not interviewed the officers yet, but apparently there were no eyewitnesses to the actual incident.
well, there's a shock.
a building full of cops, and no one saw a damn thing?
I understand that you're upset.
if you just let the investigation take its course, - I assure you that... - I've been in the system before, okay?
you guys work with the cops every day.
we both know what's gonna happen here.
how you holding up?
had better days.
talk to IAB?
not yet.
guy came at me, Jamie.
the hell was I supposed to do? - Thing is, I'm getting interviewed, so...
can't talk about it.
Yeah. I get it. - You hang in there.
you know, my old man thought I was crazy when I took this job.
said it was crazy to put your life on the line for peanuts.
might not be wrong.
looks like this is gonna get ugly.
Yeah, I could use a beer. - Just one?
doubtful. You in?
Oh, yeah.
Randy Cutter is pretty shaken up.
Yeah. I've only talked to him a couple times, but everybody says he's a really good cop.
could have happened to any of us in that bathroom. - Don't remind me.
I saw your dad.
his press conference on the news.
he's in a tough spot. - He's used to it.
crisis management's a family tradition.
it was cool the way he stood up for your sister.
Yeah, that reporter got off easy.
when it comes to sticking up for his kids, my old man doesn't take prisoners.
must be nice to know you can count on him.
murderer!
Erin's here, sir.
Oh. Thank you, Baker. Hey.
Hi. I hope you're ready.
the reservation's at 7: 30... - Oh, I canceled them.
Oh. Why?
well, I thought we could have dinner here.
Oh. Okay.
look, I called an audible.
I don't think it's a good idea for you and me to be out on the town.
you had nothing to do with me being assigned to this case.
I know, but...
sometimes the appearance of a conflict can be worse than the real thing.
so, we're just gonna hide out up here? - No. We're having dinner in.
okay by me.
I... will say that finding out from a couple of reporters was not ideal.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that, but things were moving so fast.
not like I haven't handled an officer-involved case before.
death in custody is a whole different deal.
I understand. - I don't think you do.
see, the other guy on trial here is me.
that's how this plays out.
with you in the middle...
are you saying I should have gotten your permission before taking this case?
I'm just saying that your participation complicates an already difficult situation.
Yeah, and have you thought that it works both ways?
having you as a PC hasn't made it exactly easy for me.
I know that.
but there are any number of prosecutors who could have handled this case, and there is only one PC.
Yeah, and the fact that he is my father isn't gonna stop me from doing my job!
thank you for your support with the reporters today.
excuse me.
don't think I'm gonna be very good company for dinner tonight.
officer Cutter was on the job in Nassau County for six years.
according to his evaluations, Cutter was a model cop.
Yeah, and he and his partner did volunteer to be interviewed this afternoon.
nice digs.
I didn't know they let you out of the M. E.'s office.
every now and then, we walk among the living.
you got a second for me?
Yeah, sure. Richard.
I got the preliminary findings on Christopher Collins' cause of death.
well, you could have just e-mailed that to me. - Eh, for you I schlep, especially since the case is all over the front page.
did the tox screen come back with drugs in Collins' system?
Nope. Clean as a whistle.
nice.
they don't have a picture of this from the top of the bridge?
Craig. Cause of death.
Oh, yeah. Anoxic brain injury.
does that come in English?
christopher Collins sustained pressure to the carotid artery.
cut off oxygen to the brain, resulting in respiratory arrest.
are you saying Collins was choked to death?
Yep. You got an old-fashioned homicide on your hands.
I advised Officer Cutter. He has no obligation to talk to you.
I- I know you got a job to do, and I got nothing to hide.
can you take me through the incident?
my partner and I brought the suspect into the precinct.
we stopped at the front desk, I secured my weapon.
then, on the way to the cell area, he says he needs to use the bathroom.
was Collins handcuffed at this point?
Yes. But once we got inside, I took'em off so he could relieve himself.
everything was fine till I tried to put the cuffs back on.
what happened?
I got one of the cuffs on, and he complains it's too tight.
he starts resisting. The guy's strong as an ox.
next thing I know, we're going at it.
did you call for help?
I tried. He had his hands in my face, on my throat.
did you have your hands on his throat at any point?
choke holds are against department policy.
was that a no? - Yeah.
when I finally got control of him, I called for my partner.
that's when I...
noticed Collins was unconscious.
at first I thought he was faking.
you know?
and...
then I realized he wasn't breathing.
look, I'm... sick about what happened, Ms. Reagan.
but if I didn't defend myself, it would have been me dead in that bathroom.
and where were you when the incident occurred?
I went down the hall to run the prisoner for warrants while Officer Cutter took him to the bathroom.
and when were you aware that there was something wrong?
uh, a couple minutes after we split, I heard Randy...
officer Cutter, uh, call for help.
I ran down the hallway. When I entered the bathroom.
I saw Cutter on the floor with the perp, who was unconscious.
at any point, did you see Officer Cutter...
apply any kind of choke hold on Mr. Collins?
no.
no, I didn't see anything like that.
Sarge is looking for volunteers to take an inmate back to prison after he testifies downtown. - Sure.
Thanks, boss. - You got it, Reagan.
uh, which prison?
I think he's from Lincoln Correctional.
what?
would you cut the crap? Hmm?
you know my dad's locked up over there.
Yeah, I remember you told me that.
I know what you're trying to do. I know you think you're helping.
you're not. - Look, you have to talk to him at some point.
no. I don't think that I need to talk to him at some point.
it's not gonna be a tearful reunion, okay?
not everyone comes from a perfect family, Reagan.
Hey, trust me, we have our moments.
you ever been betrayed by the person you trust most in the world?
you ever find out that everything you grew up believing was a lie?
no. - You know what?
if I need someone to fix my life, I'm gonna call a shrink, not a cop.
you're saying that cop strangled Christopher?
his death has been ruled a homicide.
however, it's still unclear if Officer Cutter's use of force was... justified.
meaning he could still get away with it.
mommy?
can I bring Gus? - Of course.
say hi to Ms. Reagan.
Hi. I like your elephant.
thank you.
she's beautiful. - Takes after her father.
was, um...
a good person. He wanted to get married. I...
I could never get my act together.
what were you two arguing about the day he died?
I told him I want to take Alex to live in Chicago.
that's where my family's from.
so he was upset you were leaving?
Alex was everything to him.
I hate to admit it, but he was a...
he was a much better parent than me.
so when the police came and tried to take him away, he...
I guess he panicked.
the thought of being far from Alex, it...
just... made him crazy.
and Christopher shouldn't have acted up with that cop, but...
he didn't deserve to die for loving his little girl.
look at this welcoming committee.
thanks for coming in, Norm. - Oh. Yeah, anything for my old boss.
how's Long Island treating you? - Eh, good.
I get a lot more fishing in than when I worked for you.
how you doing? - Hi, Chief, how are you?
baker, I need a few minutes undisturbed with the chief.
Yes, sir.
take a load off. - Mm-hmm.
you still got that old Boston Whaler?
Yep. Just put a brand-new cooler in.
I like a man who's got his priorities straight.
I wanted to talk to you about Randy Cutter.
I figured that. It's a hell of a situation.
he was under your command for six years. What can you tell me?
Randy had a solid reputation. Evaluations were excellent.
he certainly was on the fast track to detective.
why'd he leave? - Eh, a lot of guys out there, uh, they think that the NYPD's top of the line.
you guys pay more.
eh, I guess he wanted to know what it was like to work in the big city.
well...
now he knows.
Kara, thank you for meeting me.
my lawyer told me not to talk to you again. - And yet here you are.
I met Christopher Collins' daughter today.
how's she doing?
it's tough.
her father was everything to her.
when you and Officer Cutter had arrived on the scene,
Collins had just learned that his...
ex was moving their daughter to Chicago.
you have kids? - Yeah. My son's three-and-a-half.
so you can imagine how he was feeling.
that didn't give him the right to resist arrest.
or attack a cop. - No.
but I don't think he deserved to die for trying to keep his family together.
when you've been a prosecutor for a while, you kind of get a sense when...
someone isn't telling you everything they know. - I should go.
did you see Officer Cutter apply a choke hold to Collins in that bathroom?
I've been riding with Randy for over a year.
he's the best cop I know, and he saved my life on more than one occasion so I can go home to my kid.
so, in other words, you're willing to lie for him.
because when I call you in front of that grand jury, you will be under oath.
if you lie, it is a felony.
you do what you gotta do, and I'll do the same.
this corned beef is amazing, Grandpa. - Old family recipe.
which your great-grandmother guarded with her life.
why was it such a big secret?
grandma always said a family is held together by its secrets.
we're held together by corned beef and cabbage?
well... - Yeah, and tradition.
things that are passed on from generation to generation.
sounds like the NYPD.
how's that? - Well, the department's like family, and God knows they're good at keeping secrets.
what are we talking about?
everyone at this table knows about the NYPD's blue wall of silence.
not me.
it's when cops protect each other, no matter what. - It's more than that.
Yeah, like when a skel tries to slug you in the precinct bathroom, whatever they get in return for that, they deserve.
exactly.
and if the only witness to that is another cop, - then he has nothing to worry about. - Oh, come on.
I assume you're referring to Officer Walsh.
Kara's a good cop, and it's possible she didn't see anything.
you're toeing the company line now, too, huh?
what's that supposed to mean?
it means that your sister thinks that all cops lie to cover each other's butts.
Oh, she didn't say that. - Okay, I get that cops need to protect themselves, but there have to be some regulations as to how far they can go, right?
we have guidelines. - That's right.
to protect cops and the public.
but no matter what the regulations say, a cop should never rat on their partner. Ever.
so then the regulations don't really mean much, right?
smart kid.
what your father's saying is that sometimes the most important thing is personal loyalty.
so husbands and wives can't be forced to testify against each other or their kids.
that's a relief.
don't be getting any bright ideas.
that's fine, but Cutter and Walsh are not family.
they're partners. - All right, but when you're out on the street, the only person that can watch your back is your partner.
and your life is in their hands. So I don't know about you, but that makes me feel like it's a family.
but the law... doesn't see it that way.
maybe it should.
why do we have to leave so early?
I have to work... I just want to leave.
don't forget the dividends.
corned beef makes good leftovers? - Well, that's the best thing about it.
you chop it up with some potatoes and some onions, you fry it up in a skillet, and presto: corned beef hash.
I'll take this to the car.
it sounds like you've already made up your mind about asking for an indictment against my officer.
your officer? - That's the way I see 'em.
I believe Randy Cutter is guilty of criminally negligent homicide.
and you have enough to back that up?
honestly, no. I wish I had more.
well, I'm no lawyer, but it looks to me like the case against him's pretty flimsy.
well, it wouldn't be if his partner would admit to what she saw.
do you think it's fair to indict a man for what you think is true rather than what you can prove?
the point of the grand jury is not to prove innocence or guilt.
I just want to convince them to let me try the case. - I know the law.
I also know Christopher Collins attacked Officer Cutter, who was unarmed and outweighed by a good 50 pounds.
christopher Collins was unarmed, too, and "your officer" used deadly force!
if it were me or Danny or Jamie, we might've done the same thing.
I'm supposed to give Cutter the benefit of the doubt?!
the man was defending himself!
is that what the prosecutor on the case is supposed to do, or the commissioner's daughter?
you chose to make that one and the same, Erin.
christopher Collins was a father who was facing the loss of his daughter, and he was scared and confused and likely out of line, but he did not deserve to die.
you really trust your gut on this?
Yes.
officer Cutter went too far...
and he needs to pay for it.
I'm just saying she's got a job to do. - Dad doesn't?
I saw him last night. He is not happy.
why, what, did he say something? - Didn't have to say anything.
Erin's name came up and he made that face.
was it the I've-got-the weight-of-the-world on-my-shoulders face or the I-wish- I- never-had-kids face?
both faces. And you know what? He's right.
she should've never taken the case.
well, maybe nobody noticed, but Erin's a rising star in the DA's office.
she might become the first female Manhattan DA.
so what? - So, if her last name's Reagan, she's gotta prove she's independent of the NYPD and the PC.
all of our last names are Reagan and we all got careers to worry about, but family comes first.
how's it going, Jamie? - Oh, hey, you guys.
uh, this is my brother, Danny.
word is your sister's going pretty hard after Cutter.
can't talk about that. - He's a good cop.
she should cut him some slack.
Hey, how about I buy the next round, okay, and you guys take it back from where you came from?
cutter was doing his job. Your sister shouldn't sell him out for a headline.
and you should shut your face.
I think you should take my brother up on that beer.
or we could just take this outside.
Hey, come on.
let's go.
let me get this straight.
you're ready to throw down with those two knuckleheads even though they agree with everything you just said about Erin?
reagan family rule number one:
reagans can talk smack all night long.
outsiders talk smack, there's gonna be a fight.
way to get my back.
glad to help.
Hey, Frank.
morning, Norm. - I didn't think you'd take me up on that fishing trip so soon.
Yeah, well.
I was thinking about what you told me, about how Randy Cutter always wanted to work for the NYPD.
Yeah, yeah. What about it?
why did he wait six years to make the move?
you'd have to ask him that. - I'm asking you.
why would a solid cop like Cutter.
close to making detective.
suddenly turn in his shield, forfeit his seniority and start from scratch with another department?
you know, I always considered us colleagues.
friends, even, in that "from work" kind of way.
you?
Yeah, sure.
there was an allegation that went away with a quick settlement and a quiet resignation.
how did you know?
I didn't... till now.
what I told you about Cutter's reputation, that was all true.
he was a good cop for us.
but it wasn't the whole truth, was it, Norm?
cutter and his partner collared a couple of kids;
possession of narcotics. No weapons.
one of 'em ran. Cutter took off after him.
when his partner caught up, the kid had a fractured skull.
I wanted him charged.
I wanted him tossed off the force, but the county executive, he had other ideas.
it was an election year...
you let me hire a ticking time bomb.
I'm sorry, Frank.
a day late and a dollar short, Norm.
this goes public, I won't cover for you.
you're on your own.
I used to walk this beat back in the day.
as you were.
you mind if I tag along?
no, sir.
been quite a week.
you doing okay?
just trying to get through it, I guess.
you do this job on a razor's edge.
you protect people, keep the peace, and try to do it the right way.
Yes, sir. That goes for me and Randy.
but sometimes, despite your best efforts, things go wrong.
with all due respect, sir, I already gave my statement to IAB.
I read your statement, Officer Walsh.
I'm not here to question it.
used to be a Polish market on that corner.
the stores change, the faces change, but the job we do here...
that stays the same.
serve and protect.
the citizens and your partner.
Randy always had my back.
he made me a better cop.
then you owe him for that.
but it does not excuse you of the obligation to enforce the law.
Collins attacked my partner in that bathroom.
Randy had the right to defend himself.
Yes, he did.
but if he went too far, that's for a jury to decide.
my uncle was a sergeant in the 3-8 for 30 years.
and he told me a cop who won't put it all on the line for his partner doesn't deserve to wear the shield.
all due respect to your uncle, it's the cop who breaks the law doesn't deserve to wear the shield.
this thing with my dad has been chewing at me for a long time.
and I've tried everything I can think of to get over it, - but I just can't. - I get that.
he did a really bad thing.
he ruined people's lives.
he ruined my family.
and he did a real job on you.
Yeah. When you...
when you believe in someone completely and they let you down...
it messes with you.
you start to question your own judgment, and it's like you...
it's like I can't trust myself. It's like I can't trust anyone.
that's no way to live, Eddie.
I know.
that's why...
that's why today after tour.
I'm gonna, um...
I'm gonna go up there, I'm gonna see my dad.
good for you.
I- I know I don't have the right to ask you this, but I just was wondering if...
maybe you'd want to go up there... with me?
Yeah.
I could do that.
we'll start by presenting the timeline, and then I'll go into the medical examiner's report.
I'll have the slides ready to go.
great. And...
can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah. I'll meet you inside.
I owe you an apology.
no. No, you don't owe me anything.
except the truth.
you were right.
I didn't tell you everything I saw.
I couldn't. - I know it's difficult.
when I heard Cutter call for help,
I ran to the bathroom.
I saw Cutter and Collins on the floor.
cutter had Collins around the neck. Collins was turning blue.
Randy, let him go.
Randy. - I told Randy to let him go.
get help. - But he didn't.
I mean, his motor was going pretty good, he was just locked in.
go for help!
and he told me to go get help.
I should have stayed.
maybe I could have stopped it.
no. What happened is not your fault.
by the time I came back with help,
Randy was giving him CPR, but...
by then it was too late.
it takes a lot of courage to tell the truth.
better late than never, I guess.
he didn't mean to kill him, Ms. Reagan.
he just went too far.
you okay to go inside?
Eddie, you all right?
starting to think that maybe this wasn't such a hot idea.
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
Yeah, really? Well, maybe you should go in, 'cause I'm gonna go back to the car.
Hey. Hey. Eddie. Eddie.
you're doing the right thing here.
it's just crazy.
he's... You know, he's my father, and I have absolutely no idea what to say to him.
I think he just wants to see you. - No. I think he wants me to forgive him.
and I don't know that I can do that.
you know, when we first started working together,
I got to admit, I had my doubts about you.
say what? - Rich girl from the suburbs, fancy car, four feet tall, - wiseass attitude. - Oh. Like you're God's gift to the NYPD?
then we got in a couple tough spots together, and you know what?
you really showed me something. - Yeah.
what?
no matter what goes down, you never take a step back.
you're not afraid, Eddie.
well, maybe I just do a good job hiding it.
either way, you, you do what you got to do.
you can do this.
what the hell?
I left my gun back in my locker, so it's not like I'm gonna shoot the guy.
that's the spirit.
thank you.
Yep.
sir.
officer Cutter's here. - Let's have him.
thanks for coming in. Please sit down.
commissioner.
I understand you started a fund for Christopher Collins' daughter.
thank you.
the least I could do.
if-if I could take back what happened...
I know.
how do you think the grand jury went?
my lawyers advised me not to testify.
I- I wanted to...
wanted to tell them what really happened.
well, looks like things are working out for you.
I just got a heads up.
the grand jury declined to indict you.
thank you, sir.
they say a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich, but...
when a police officer acts in the line of duty, suddenly they seem to lose their appetite.
well, I-I'm just... grateful I can get back to work.
not here.
sir?
Oh. I'm sure there are PDs that would consider you an asset.
but not this one.
not while I'm police commissioner.
uh- I don't understand.
I know what happened out on Long Island.
that was an accident, sir. The guy resisted arrest.
like Christopher Collins?
you know, at a certain point, it seems like it's your problem, not their problem.
that's not fair.
well, it is my job to decide whether two bad incidents in an otherwise stellar seven-year career...
make you... an unlucky cop...
or a dangerous cop.
and I have to err on the side of caution here.
look, you walked a beat, Commissioner.
you know what it's like when your life's on the line.
we get paid to keep the peace with restraint and good judgment, even...
when our lives are on the line.
not everyone's built for it.
you are not built for it. - I defended myself.
with a choke hold that is clearly not authorized by this department.
look, you-you can't do this.
all due respect, sir, I want a hearing. - You're still on probation.
I can terminate you anytime I choose.
this job is not about being strong enough to use force.
it's about being strong enough not to.
I'm sorry.
you're dismissed.
didn't mean to barge in. - Well, security didn't call.
you must have some juice.
most of the guys downstairs used to work for me.
well, you cops do stick together.
I heard about the grand jury.
well, I thought I was home free once Officer Walsh came forward.
thank you for that, by the way. - I don't know what you're talking about.
I also got an anonymous tip that Cutter had cracked someone's skull open in Long Island.
I suppose you don't know anything about that, either.
Nope.
cutter wouldn't take the stand, so I didn't get his violent past on the record.
what about Officer Walsh's testimony?
it wasn't enough.
at the end of the day, the jurors just saw a cop defending himself against a violent criminal.
started out that way.
Yeah.
I just wish Cutter knew when to stop and I pray he doesn't go out there - and do it all over again. - He won't.
not here, anyway.
what happened to, uh, giving him the benefit of the doubt?
in this case, it didn't benefit anybody but him.
look at you, all wised up.
when I found out you were handling the case...
I reacted badly.
well, I could have given you a heads up.
you were doing your job.
I was only thinking of mine.
I'm sorry.
thank you for that.
I could use a drink.
join me?
isn't that some kind of conflict of interest?
well, we could get separate checks.
isn't this place charming?
as advertised, but you didn't invite me here for the charm or the ice cream. - We can't just have ice cream?
we can, but not in this instance.
okay, I have a problem.
well, first of all, your mom's got a lot on her plate, and I think she's doing an outstanding job considering...
it's not about Mom.
it's about my teacher.
it's like she's made it her mission in life to keep me from ever graduating.
turn that thing off. - But what if it's important?
choose.
look, here's the problem.
she's notorious for being harder on the girls, but when she found out I was from a family of cops...
look, I should really check it. - Choose.
grandpa... - How would you feel if I was constantly interrupting?
deputy Commissioner Moore just walked in.
a cop's been shot.
who and where?
north End bus yard, multiple precincts rolled, but radio chatter's not clear on a name, how bad they're hit.
we've got conflicting descriptions of perps and direction of flight.
tell me something we do know.
Whoever' s down is a detective out of Danny's precinct.
this is Detective Reagan.
leave a message.
Hey, Danny, it's me, give me a call. Let me know everything's okay.
Hey, voice mail again?
Yeah, third time. You heard anything new?
lady called 911, said she was out walking her dog, heard yelling from behind a fence.
someone being accused of being a cop. Shots fired.
there's still no name? - Only that he was rushed to St. Benjamin' s.
a couple of guys are headed over.
all right, I'm gonna ask the boss if we can, too, just in case, all right? - Okay, come on, there's got to be 15 detectives in the 5-4 squad.
odds are it isn't your brother.
Danny's wife. - No way she's heard anything.
unless she got the call.
Hey, Linda. - Jamie, it's not Danny.
he called you?
Yeah, in case I heard, but he's fine. He's working a case in Murray Hill, and he said he was gonna call your dad as soon as he hung up with me.
thank God. - Yeah, no kidding.
listen...
Hi, Mom! - Awesome!
Yeah, I'm picking the boys up right now, so could you call Erin and Henry?
you know, make sure they're not worried, too. - Yeah, they already are.
Thanks, Linda.
I'm glad it wasn't Danny. There, I said it.
I felt the same way. Danny's family.
steve Tomlin has one, too.
let's hope for the best.
Dino says Steve has been undercover for the last year, working his way up the chain of a drug operation run by Santo Castillo.
somebody made him.
word is, after Castillo shot him, Steve managed to put a slug in Castillo, who ran off.
tough cop.
gave him the Combat Cross in '09.
commissioner?
how's my officer?
um, I'm afraid he's gone. Three bullets, one through the carotid.
he lost too much blood by the time he arrived.
thank you, Doctor.
I'll need to talk to his wife.
Lorraine. Married to Steve for 22 years, tax accountant by trade.
they have a home in Staten Island.
Frank, she's here.
two daughters, Bella and Lucy, both in college.
Mrs. Tomlin?
I'm so sorry.
can I arrange to get Lucy and Bella home from school?
Oh, that, uh...
uh, yes.
um, thank you.
my department owes Steve a deep debt of gratitude for his years of service.
anything we can do to help, you only need to ask.
catch whoever murdered my husband.
we will do that.
tell me we got the son of a bitch.
wish I could. - That's not the answer I want to hear, Dino.
Yes, sir. Morning, Baker.
morning, sir.
Castillo was shot. That would've slowed him down.
he hasn't turned up in any E. R. in the tri-state. I've got the whole department out looking.
half of them are doing it on their own time. - Who'd you put with the family?
johnson and Garcia. They came up in the ranks together. - And on the case?
sergeant Gormley said he gave it to the best detective he's got.
on the ground! Get on the ground!
move it!
back away from that sink!
on the ground now!
turn around, get on the ground, put your hands behind your head!
Where's your boss? - Who?
you heard me. Castillo. - Yo, we're just cleaning crew.
yeah?
my cleaning lady keeps a bazooka, too.
still enough here to send you down the drain.
what's your name? - Ticky.
Ticky, you want a break? Give up the cop killer.
like he said, we don't know anything.
fine, you want to play stupid with me, get your hands up on the sink.
move! I got all the time in the world till you decide to wise up.
as far as I'm concerned, each one of you pulled the trigger on Steve Tomlin.
get them out of here.
Erin, that was impressive.
well, sometimes when you get the right witness, the whole case will fall into place.
well, I'll get her statement typed up and to the DA by lunch. - Great.
can you find the car? - Lady, can you give me some help?
sorry, I don't have any change.
I mean a different kind of help. - Tyler?
what? - Tyler Jeffries. I'm Nicky's mom.
uh, my-my name's not Tyler. - From Blessed Heart.
you came to our house for Nicky's birthday party last year. - I said I'm not him.
forget it. - Tyler, are you okay?
here we go, Erin. - Yeah, I'll be right there.
put him in interrogation.
this one in the radio room. Cuff the others to something solid.
don't let them talk to each other or so much as trade glances.
this goes real easy, fellas.
first one to give up Castillo wins the prize.
you get the radio room; I got the box. - Got it.
reagan, you want help?
no. - I got cops from a dozen precincts volunteering to turn the screws on these guys.
no, we're gonna get a crack at them first.
all right, listen, Steve kept me in the loop on this Castillo.
says his people are unusually loyal.
boss of the year? Great, I'm jealous.
well, I'm just saying, you might hit a brick wall.
then I'll drag his family in here.
if you can find them. Apparently he has a sister, but Castillo made her change her name so nobody could find her and use her against him in some way.
do you have any more words of encouragement here, Sarge, 'cause this level of optimism is really firing me up.
all right, just-just holler if you need help, all right?
if you hear any hollering, it won't be me. Open it up.
what are you doing?
homework. - Without being asked?
who are you and what have you done with my daughter?
how was your day?
weird.
you know that boy from your class, Tyler Jeffries?
Yeah. - What's his story?
funny.
super nice. He's not in my class anymore, though.
he and his mom moved, like, five months ago.
I guess Tyler was getting high and stuff, so his mom put him in boarding school upstate to straighten him out.
well, I don't think it worked. - What do you mean?
I ran into him today in Hell's Kitchen, and he looked messed up on drugs or homeless or both.
what? - Yeah, it took me a second to even recognize him.
Oh, my God.
but you helped him, right? - Well, he ran off before I could.
then we got to go find him.
well, I will call Child Services, and they will contact his mother.
come on, can we just go look for him?
relax, all right? I will handle it.
get him out of my face.
nothing? - Nothing.
none of my guys even so much as asked for a lawyer.
they just sat there smirking at me.
you? - Same.
so what's next? - Pot of coffee.
Yeah, I'll go make one. - Thanks.
how's it going?
don't ask. - Okay, so you want to give me a hand?
I'm kind of busy here, Sarge.
I need a witness to open Steve Tomlin's locker, collect his effects to give to his family.
okay, I'll get a box.
I always hate this more than the funeral.
a life interrupted and all. - Well, at least there's no bagpipes.
they always make me cry.
it's empty.
I talked to Steve yesterday before he started his tour, Sarge.
his locker was open and it was full.
his uniform was in there, there were papers everywhere and pictures.
somebody must've cleaned it out after he died. - But before we could find it.
who the hell's hiding what?
the number of cops lost in the line of duty since you've been on the job.
and now 23 since sitting behind this desk.
you want me to do a draft of your remarks for the service?
you ask me every time, Garrett. - And I'm gonna keep asking.
some things you can't delegate, even a piece of.
but you could take a look at it when I'm done.
not yet. Last night Sergeant Gormley went to collect Steve Tomlin's things, but somebody got there first. Locker was completely empty.
someone sanitized it.
and no way was it a civilian just waltzing in off the street.
I don't get it.
what's the big deal about a guy's locker? - What's in it. Or isn't.
any evidence of tampering goes right up the chain of command.
what, you think Castillo's got a mole in the 5-4? - That's the bad version.
I got a worse one: someone's covering for Tomlin.
we got a problem, Chief. - You sure this is a "we," Frank?
wouldn't it be better and quieter if the department dealt with this on the precinct level?
no.
thanks for coming, Uncle Jamie.
everything okay? Your text said it was "serious.
Yeah, it's about a friend of mine. - A friend?
no, really, he's a great kid. Name's Tyler.
he went to my school, but Mom said she saw him in Hell's Kitchen - looking like he was on drugs. - Did he use when you knew him?
I know he smoked pot sometimes.
no, I don't. But if I did, and it'd help find Tyler, then I'd admit it.
so you want me to look for him. - Could you?
mom said it was around 35th and 10th.
that's a pretty sketchy area. - Yeah, I know.
here, that's what he looks like.
your mom know you want me to do this?
Yeah, she's really worried, too.
she would've been here, but she wanted to go talk to Child Services about him.
all right, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, Uncle Jamie.
and this isn't just me saying it.
this comes straight from the commissioner:
someone in the 5 - 4 cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker "without authorization...
or knows who did.
which may very well be impeding the murder investigation of a brother in blue to each and every one of you. So let me be clear.
"if Detective Tomlin's belongings don't end up in my office by 24 hours, there'll be hell to pay for all of us."
so, folks, while the rest of us get back to finding this son of a bitch Castillo, one of you is gonna stand up and do the right thing.
you owe it to Steve.
that's all.
so, who do you think it is?
I don't want to believe anybody in this room could be capable of being Castillo's mole.
well, he found out Tomlin was undercover somehow.
well, maybe we'll get lucky and find it in all this data we gotta look through.
well, looks like TARU found a bunch of steamy text messages from one of our thug's cell phones.
which thug?
said it belonged to Ticky, the one who was dumping the coke earlier.
I grilled him. He didn't say squat.
well, it looks like he had a lot to say when he was texting this Vivian girl.
look who he says her brother is. - Castillo.
son of a bitch. - He was transported down to Central Booking.
let's get his ass back here now.
Ah, another day of crime-fighting.
we should get capes. - I should get a new partner.
so why did you ask the boss for this sector today?
a favor for my niece and sister.
a friend of Nicky's was in this area the other day looking kind of rough, so I said I'd look for him.
man, you do more for your family by 9: 00 a.m., than my family's done for each other our entire lives.
name's Tyler Jeffries, about five-foot-eight, he's 16. - I still don't got nothing to say. - Why don't you relax, Ticky?
why do they even call you Ticky, anyway?
is it because you're a leech on a big fish like Santo Castillo, is that it?
I like watches.
which is appropriate since your time's running out, unless you tell us where to find your boss.
yo, like I told you before, I don't know who you're talking about.
Really? - Even though you're banging his sister... what is, uh, Vivian?
say what?
say you right here in these text messages.
Viv, you were incredible last night as always." To which she replied...
keep it on the DL, baby. My bro will kill us if he finds out.
to which you replied... "U kidding? Santo heart me.
and I could kick, I could kick his ass anyway.
that's a different Santo.
hmm. - Really? Even though Vivian wrote back...
Santo only hearts his $ and his drugs.
watch yourself." - To which you replied...
I only wanna watch u, baby.
Oh, smooth talker, I'll give him that. - Yeah.
Yeah. Let's just hope he's smooth enough to talk Santo out of blowing his brains out.
okay, okay! So I been hooking up with his sister.
great. Now you can tell us where she lives. - I can't tell you.
you know one big difference between you and I?
is that I'm not afraid of your boss, unlike you.
in fact, when I see him, I'm pretty much gonna tell him that you told us everything. In fact, maybe I'll even show him this lovely little picture that his sister sent to you.
please, look, if I give him up, he's gonna have me killed.
her, too.
which means we're the only ones who can protect you, as long as you start talking.
Yep, so why don't you tell us where she lives?
now!
police! Open up!
you can't just walk in here.
yeah? Well, this says we can. Step aside. Step aside!
see how easy that works?
let's go! - Don't touch me!
come on. Tear this place apart. Let's go.
you can't just do that, all right? I know my rights.
Where's your brother, Vivian? - I don't have one.
Santo Castillo, you're his sister
Dolores, until he made you change your name to Vivian Vasquez.
what are you talking about? - Do you think we're stupid? He got shot up.
you're a nurse. Where else would he go?
maybe to his real sister, 'cause you got the wrong place.
so you all can kiss my ass! - Hey! Your brother's a cop killer.
and he's going down hard. And if you're harboring him, you're gonna go down just as hard, you understand?
and I ain't going nowhere 'cause I'm the only one here.
hands where I can see 'em! - Is that right?
let me go! I didn't do nothing!
perp in custody! - You were saying?
come on, come on. He hid in the tub.
Yeah, real original.
hope you got clean, Castillo, 'cause that's the last shower you're gonna take by yourself for a long time.
Yeah, and if you think you're in a bad mood now, wait till you find out your sister's screwing the help.
what's he saying?
santo, I can explain. - You'll explain it to him later. Get him the hell out of here.
get him in the hallway.
take a look at 'em all, Castillo.
every cop in here wants to take a piece out of you. Open up.
I want my lawyer. - Won't do you any good. Next stop for you is a deep, dark hole.
Yeah, and on your way down, you can tell us who helped you set up Steve.
what?
your mole inside this precinct.
if that's what you think, you ain't never gonna figure out how I found out.
right.
giving up the cop who set up Steve is the only card you've got- tell your lawyer to play it.
let's go - I want to wash this dirtbag off my hands.
checking to see if Castillo's gonna give you up, Becker?
you're out of your mind. - What's your problem?
thought opening lockers was your specialty.
Steve's locker's right behind me.
that gives you plenty of opportunity to scope out his combination, or eavesdrop and see how close he's getting to Castillo.
listen, Detective...
the only thing I'm listening to, Becker, is you admit to it right now.
okay, fine, it was me.
I cleaned it out! - You Castillo's mole?
huh? - No, you got that wrong!
why'd you do it?!
Hey, beat it! Both of you, beat it now!
it's none of your damn business. - Start talking, Becker.
I just copped to it, Reagan.
but that's all I got to say.
and you understand the consequences of what you did?
possible grand larceny, possible criminal possession of stolen property, possible conspiracy in the murder of a police officer.
Yes, sir. - Yet you didn't ask for a lawyer or a union rep.
I don't need one, sir.
it was me who cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker.
on a cop killer's orders?
at ease.
sit down.
what you did doesn't square with your record.
come on, Bill.
I know you're sitting on something.
six years ago...I was still on probation...and me and my training officer heard this bank heist call go over the air.
steve was already on the scene when we got there, and all of a sudden, these robbers burst out, guns blazing...
and...
I froze. - I assume this is going somewhere.
steve pushed me out of the way before I got my head blown off...and he took down both the perps.
he... He saved the day.
that night I bought all his drinks and... we became friends.
so you owed him?
what was he mixed up in?
steve was clean as a whistle, sir.
and - and this has nothing to do with the job.
then I know he wouldn't want you to blow up your career over this.
he has another family.
wait, so you saw Tyler?
Yeah. About a block down from where your mom saw him.
he was digging through a trash can. - Was he on drugs?
he didn't look good. - But, you - you took him home, right?
no. We never got the chance. He pushed Eddie pretty hard and then he ran.
we went after him, but... he was gone, just like that.
God. So, he's still out there? - Unfortunately, yeah, but I gave his photo to all the cars in the precinct and I'm gonna ask for the same assignment tomorrow, okay?
like hell you will. - Mom!
I was just telling Uncle Jamie about...
Yeah. I heard all about it. You sent him out looking?
just let me explain. - Wait. What?
I thought you said your mom knew about this?
would you both just listen to me?
look, I had to make sure Tyler got help before something bad happened.
so that justifies going behind my back?
and lying to me, Nicky? - I'm sorry.
but maybe if you didn't treat me like I'm still a little kid...
well, you just proved that you are, by ignoring me when I said I would take care of it.
so, did you? - I spoke to ACS, they've reached out to Tyler's mom, and I haven't heard back yet.
so now he's out there somewhere doing God knows what with God knows who.
the conversation's over.
if you don't eat your vegetables, no dessert.
delicious, as always.
you hardly ate.
I ate.
who made the potatoes? - Uh, I think it was Nicky.
better not say you didn't like 'em. - Loved 'em.
good and cheesy.
I'm surprised you found time to cook.
I managed. - Mm-hmm.
we missing something here?
feeling a little cold chill coming from this side of the table.
what's going on? - Nothing anyone needs to know about.
see, Francis? Hard enough having even one family some days.
boys, take your plates and go eat in the kitchen.
so you guys can have a conversation we're not supposed to hear?
that's exactly right, Jack. - Go on.
come on, I'll eat with you.
go easy on this, Pop. - I'm not going to pussyfoot around this.
what kind of cop has two families?
what? Who? The one that got killed?
Yeah. - Yeah, Steve Tomlin. He had a wife and two kids in Staten Island and a girlfriend with a newborn baby in Jersey.
and you didn't know?
steve is in your squad. - He was in my squad and I'm friendly with him, but pretty much nobody knew what was going on with him.
well, you know what, one of those women knew what was going on, - and it was probably the girlfriend. - So she doesn't deserve any sympathy?
he's the father of her kid. - No, that's not what I'm saying, Jamie.
maybe he was that good of a catch that they were happy to share him.
I personally just try to figure out where a man finds the time or energy - to carry on with two families. - You-you looking for some tips?
no, I'm not looking for tips. I'm just saying it's a mess.
which isn't over.
right, the funeral.
well, you can count me out. - And we will.
Oh, come on, Grandpa. We don't really know what was going on with Tomlin's life.
I mean, maybe he was making the best of a bad situation, you know?
you saying you excuse what he did?
no, I'm just saying I'm reserving judgment until the smoke clears a little.
exactly.
I got personal items for two different women.
some need to go to the girlfriend. - Mmm, kind of got to side with Gramps on this one.
thank you.
there's a line, and men know where it's drawn.
you're also the cop on the case.
well, then I'll deliver whatever I need to.
thank you, Danny. - You got it, Dad.
guess what sector we got this morning.
judging by the smile on your face, Restaurant Row.
back to Hell's Kitchen.
Really? - Boss says we did great.
15 summonses and a felony collar.
and I volunteered us since I know you want to find Tyler again.
says who?
your niece put you on the case. - Yeah, until my sister blew a gasket.
sergeant. - Come on, friend of Nicky's or not, that kid needs help.
so let's go find him again.
but he's not gonna be hanging around Hell's Kitchen. Not after he knows we're looking for him.
Yeah, I thought the same thing till I talked to a couple of guys in Narcotics who executed a warrant on a drug spot on that very same block this morning.
and guess who was seen running from the scene.
well, let's go look for Tyler.
I knew I loved him from the moment we met.
he moved me here, and pretty soon she was on the way.
and now it's just us two.
I'm sorry it took so long, with all the... issues around Steve.
issues?
did Steve stay home every night?
no, he was undercover. Had to be gone a lot.
did he wear a ring?
no, why would he? He was single.
detective, what - what are you saying?
I'm saying that Steve Tomlin was married.
no.
he had two kids. Both in their 20s.
no. You're wrong. He w... he was with me.
we were going to get married, just-just as soon as-as...as soon as...
I'm sorry.
regardless of whether or not he was married, it's obvious that he loved you.
you're defending him?
surprises me, too.
look, Steve could have abandoned the both of you, but he didn't.
in fact, you should probably take a look at this.
it was in his locker, too.
deferred compensation. - Kind of like a pension.
cop gets to choose who the beneficiaries are, and Steve chose the both of you.
so Angela will be taken care of?
I'm not sure if he filed it.
but it's obvious that he wanted the both of you to be taken care of.
do you think... he would've done that if he didn't love you very much?
police!
stop!
hold it right there. - Let me go. Please.
please let me go. Please.
Why? So you can go get high again? Aw, sorry, buddy, those days are over.
Yeah. Along with shoving police officers, which, by the way, is assault.
Hey. We tried this the easy way. Now you get the hard way.
you got anything sharp in your pockets, like a needle? Anything that's gonna stick me?
look, I-I don't do drugs. - Yeah, that's not what my niece says.
look, I, I was a screwup at school, okay?
but I stopped all that. I swear. - Yeah?
what were you passing around with your pals back there?
your report card with all As?
it was...
it was her photo.
to see if anyone's seen her.
"her" who, huh?
it's just a picture.
my mom...came down here a week ago to score and never came back home.
she's the junkie.
thanks for bringing these.
the girls'll be happy to know their father kept them so close.
I'm just trying to carry out what...I think he'd want.
steve was a hell of a cop, and I honor that.
it's all he ever wanted to be.
well, I'll be sure and say that when I stand up for him at the funeral.
and if there's anything else my department can do...
I only have to ask.
can I ask this?
could you please not lie to me, Commissioner?
Steve's lies were bad enough, but to have all of you parade around here with your sad smiles and your pats on the back for the poor widow...and nobody has the guts to admit what I've known for the past year?
I'm not sure I understand.
of course.
once I knew, I did what every good wife does.
blamed myself.
tried to make him love me again. I mean, I...I do love the guy.
and the only time I lost it was when I...I'd had too much to drink and I...I found his phone and I called the number I didn't recognize and I told the bitch off.
told her I was the one who had stuck by him all these years and raised his family while he was out on the job.
and I hung up the phone before she could get a word in edgewise.
I'm very sorry.
you know what you could do?
skip Steve's funeral.
just skip the nice speech about how honor is such a big part of the job.
how the NYPD appreciates the sacrifices made by the families.
you might be able to get the words out, but I, for one, don't want to hear them.
his real family doesn't want to hear it.
can you do that for me?
good-bye, Commissioner.
I've got good news. - I could use some.
corporation counsel reviewed Steve Tomlin's financials.
he filled out his deferred compensation papers but never submitted them, so they're invalid.
the Staten Island family will get all the money and benefits.
and how is that good news?
well, the last thing this office needs is legal wrangling with an irate widow.
or lurid headlines about a two-timing cop.
so it's good news for this office?
what about Marianna and their baby?
well, technically, they're not his family.
technically? - I don't blame them.
doesn't take a ring to make a family.
I tried to give you an out, Frank. But you chose to be mixed up in this.
I'm just telling you where we are. - On the high moral ground, apparently.
that's not fair. - None of this is.
that's no excuse to turn our backs on a woman with a cop's baby.
look, if you can figure a way to help out both families, I'm all ears.
as far as I see it, the department's hands are tied.
you really sure I should be here?
I called your mom to ask her, but she didn't answer, so...
no, I mean because I lied to you.
we're good, Nicky. And I think that Tyler could really use a friend right about now.
Tyler. Oh, my God, I thought you moved.
that's what I told everyone. So they wouldn't know the truth.
Tyler's mom has been having some problems.
what do you mean?
first it was prescription drugs.
then it became other stuff.
ms. Jeffries disappeared about a week ago.
Tyler's been out looking for her.
why didn't you let my mom help you? Or my uncle?
because then you'd find out, and... people at school.
but...
I guess they'll all find out anyway when it's in the papers that she's dead.
Tyler, we don't know that she is. - Then why can't I find her?
I've looked everywhere. - Because she's been in the hospital.
accidental OD. She's been a Jane Doe at Bellevue for a couple days.
is there any way I can see her? - That's why I'm here.
so you did keep looking for her.
and your uncle is on his way down from Rhode Island.
you'll stay with him until your mom gets clean.
thank you so much.
all of you.
we just did what she asked.
come on.
I want a cape.
Cheers.
Yeah.
I need a little help here, Pop. - Is this about that Tomlin fellow?
his second family needs to be taken care of.
wasn't that his job?
well, he got himself killed in the line of duty before he got around to it.
so throw him a 10-13 party.
there is a three-month-old baby girl who's gonna grow up without a father.
and the problem does not get solved by some cash in a cigar box on a bar.
where is everyone?
in here.
Oh. Are you here to help your old man muscle me into pitching in?
if that's what's going on, I am now.
come on, Pop.
you're on the board of the Policeman's Fund.
Yeah, so?
so it may be time to put some of that influence to good use, Gramps.
create a back-pocket pension for one more widow and orphan.
old dog, new tricks. - I haven't said yes.
you gonna say no?
so what's going on?
I went to see the girlfriend again to confirm that Tomlin's wife did in fact call her as she claimed.
wait a minute.
the wife called the girlfriend? - The wife thought she called the girlfriend.
she found a number in Tomlin's cell phone.
she called it, thinking it would be the girlfriend on the other end.
Tomlin was undercover in Castillo's gang.
and unfortunately...
she accidentally called one of them.
Yeah.
it was Tomlin's wife who blew his cover, Gramps.
couple days later, we got a dead cop.
you got to be kidding me.
if I was kidding, someone would be laughing.
good Lord.
she loses her husband and then has to hear this.
it'll kill the woman.
unless she doesn't hear it.
I can't lie to that woman again.
she has to know.
commissioner Reagan.
I need to talk to you, Mrs. Tomlin.
I've said everything I have to say.
well, I'm afraid I haven't.
I'm sorry, I got nothing for nobody.
I'm burying my husband tomorrow.
I didn't handle our meeting very well, yesterday, and I'm sorry.
but I think...Steve would've wanted the NYPD represented at his service.
I know he would.
and it would be my honor to do that for him.
you came all the way out here just to ask me that?
Yes, I did.
boat leaves in ten minutes, Pop.
I've never been late in my life, Francis.
I can't find my iPod.
kitchen. And the skirt-- really?
Danny? - Yeah?
honey, the kids are in the car. - All right, babe.
you know the Verrazano at this hour.
Yeah. I'm coming.
it is without profound praise and gratitude that I welcome you new police officers, proud that you have answered the call to service and today join the ranks of New York's finest.
you have earned the distinction of being the best trained, best prepared police officers in the world, ready to serve and protect the most vibrant city in the world, where every day brings a responsibility to keep all New Yorkers safe from crime, and safe from terrorism.
and though the city is on the very cutting edge of technology, nothing replaces your unwavering sense of right and wrong and your eyes and ears on the street.
and we remain safe because of the hard work and dedication of the men and women of the New York City Police Department.
now, we all wear the same blue uniform, carry the same shield.
now you are a part of the finest police force in the world.
your friends, and congratulations to you, our new New York City police officers.
I'm not an invalid. I had a hip replacement.
Mr. Mayor.
inspiring words, Frank.
Hey, Dave.
but we miss you up at the 64.
I don't miss you guys.
how the hell are you supposed to find anybody in this mess?
dad!
Hey. - Grandpa, over here!
great speech, Dad.
Hi. - Hey.
Hey, Grandpa. - I'm proud of you, son.
Thanks, Dad.
Hey. - Hey.
you looked great up there.
mom's probably spinning in her grave, you quitting the law and becoming a cop and all.
Danny. - I'm just saying.
golden boy was on the fast track to Washington.
now look at him.
just like the rest of us Reagans-- another boot in a suit.
don't must my chops, Danny.
excuse me, all the Reagans? - I'm sorry.
I forgot we got an assistant district attorney - Thank you.
in the family-- I'm so proud of you, sister.
we'd have another lawyer in the family if these two would set a date.
what, and spoil all the fun?
Hey, Reagan, we made it. - Yeah!
congratulations, boss.
dad, this is Officer Romano.
first woman recruit to win the sharpshooter medal. Well done.
thank you, sir. I just wanted to say hello.
you must be... Sydney, right?
Congratulations.
Thanks. I'll see you around, Reagan. - Okay.
she won the sharpshooter medal.
your father said.
well, the gang's all here.
I guess we should be getting over to the Breslin.
Oh, sorry, but first-year associates don't get lunch.
I'm lucky they let me out for this.
it was amazing.
okay. - Bye, everybody.
love you. - Bye.
Bye, Sidney.
she seems to be handling this well, you being a cop.
we're working on it.
it can't be easy after watching you bury your brother.
Joe died doing what he loved to do.
little brother, I'm gonna have to buy you a beer another time.
I got a missing kid. Got to go.
you up to catch a case?
Yeah, Dad. Demarcus is on his way.
I'll see you guys later.
Bye. Bye, boys.
Bye. - Bye.
little girl-- I don't like the sound of it.
your glass half empty much?
I mean, she could turn up at a friend's house.
Yeah, but, then, why'd they call us?
smile for the cameras, Danny boy.
all right, all right, all right.
what do we got?
nine-year-old female Hispanic, Teresa Campos, didn't come home from school, St. Anita up the block.
the mother there got worried, went looking for her, and the building super told her he saw a couple of young boys grab a pink backpack from the gutter here and run off with it.
backpack hers?
you find the kids who found the backpack?
not yet. I got Housing doing verticals in the projects, and aviation's en route to check rooftops.
anybody see anything else?
this doll was found near where the backpack was.
one of those ones you press it and it talks.
change me. I'm wet.
anyway, the mother said she never seen it before.
all right, voucher it and get prints and serology on it, okay?
let's put out an AMBER Alert request, get a canvass going.
there's a lot of cameras around. Check the surveillance video, clear out all the apartment Dumpsters, mailboxes, drains, sewers, everything
just try not to let the family see what you're doing, okay?
gotcha.
you know that feeling you were getting?
Yeah. - I'm getting it, too.
Mr. and Mrs. Campos, I'm Detective Reagan.
this is my partner, Detective King.
we understand your daughter went missing.
I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions.
she always comes home. She comes home every day.
she knows her mother worries.
she's a good girl.
I'm sure she is-- I know how difficult this must be for you.
is it possible she may have run away?
maybe you had a fight, maybe an ex-husband may have taken her.
Rigo's her father. There was no fight.
where is she? You have to find her.
the more you can tell us, Mrs. Campos, the more we can help.
detective, can I talk to you? - Excuse me.
woman there saw a white van pull away from the curb here really crazy.
white van in New York City? That narrows it down.
Yeah, I know-- she didn't get the plates, either, but she said it had a cracked rear window.
all right, let's put the van out on the wire, notify bridge and tunnel security-- maybe we'll get lucky.
change me. I'm wet.
I'm thinking this isn't a simple custodial dispute, partner.
Yeah. - Doesn't smell like a ransom case, either.
Yeah, but we got another problem.
little girl's a diabetic.
she gets insulin shots every 24 hours.
so if she doesn't get 'em... - My baby...
please! You have to find her! - We'll do all we can.
we'll do all we can. We'll do all we can, ma'am.
it's all right, it's all right.
Oh, my baby! - It's all right.
help...
commissioner Reagan! Commissioner Reagan!
commissioner Reagan! Commissioner!
all right, before I take questions...
as you all know, the first hours are crucial in a case like this, so I'm asking for the media's help in keeping Teresa's face before the public.
our task force will respond to each and every lead, and I assure you the New York City Police Department will not rest till we find this little girl.
Miguel. - Commissioner Reagan, what do you say to blog allegations there's a third fewer police than on the Allie Dintenfass AMBER Alert on the Upper East Side last summer?
Miguel, you're a professional journalist.
do you really want to give credence to any amateur blogger with a laptop?
then what is your response to polls that show an endemic lack of faith in police by the Latino community and a slow and steady rise in crime there?
I don't respond to polls, Miss Davidson.
but since I've been on the job, crime is down across the board.
so you're claiming that the mayor's budgetary cutbacks aren't affecting the department's ability to keep all citizens of this city safe?
none of us is concerned about cost today.
a nine-year-old girl is missing, and the clock is ticking.
we need to find Teresa.
just make sure you media people do your job and keep her face before the public. Next question.
what a world. 16.
16 registered sex offenders within a five-block radius of this girl's home.
what have you got for me, partner?
tip on a white van with a little girl in Astoria, but it was just an Asian family.
all right, it's going to be a long night. Let's get to work.
Hey, caught your news conference on the kidnap, Frank.
it was a nice job.
come in.
you know, Frank, we got to find this kid.
alive.
we're doing everything we can, Mr. Mayor.
that better be good enough.
I hear your boy is lead detective?
if you're talking about Detective First Grade Daniel Reagan,
I heard that, too.
you think that's wise, Frank?
could be exposing yourself to all kinds of scrutiny if it goes south.
you're popular with the public, but I don't have to tell you, you don't have a lot of friends in high places to back you up.
I don't spend a lot of time worrying about that.
well, maybe you should.
Oh, yeah, and another thing.
the attitude with the press and that little sound bite about how since you've been chief and the crime stats decreasing.
there is no future in that kind of grandstanding.
just ask your old man.
it occurred to me that with all you've got on your plate, you might not have time to drop off the roast for Sunday dinner.
you calling about the roast, or are you looking for an update, Dad?
well, speaking as your boss,
I hope you know you have all the resources you need.
well, I appreciate that, boss.
I'll keep you posted.
ay, ay, ay. - What's up, Reagan?
motivational call from my old man.
what about you? - Yeah. It's not great news.
RTCC's data mine of our girl's neighborhood?
the sketchy-ass uncle's been locked up on Rikers Island for DWI.
you know, I had such high hopes for that man.
I just keep thinking about that girl.
imagine how afraid she is, how afraid her family is.
Where's the doll? We need the doll.
Why? The lab didn't pull anything from it.
no DNA. No prints. - Yeah, but that's just it.
I mean, if the doll belonged to another girl, then why is it so clean?
I mean, there's no prints, no DNA, no nothing. Why?
well, 'cause maybe... maybe they wore gloves.
and they used it as bait to lure the girl in.
exactly. All right, there's got to be a label or a stamp or something on the doll.
let's find out who makes it, where they sell it.
maybe this talking doll can tell us something. - All right.
give me the Evidence Room.
had to be China, right?
they're trying to find someone who speaks English.
what is it over there, tomorrow or yesterday?
Yes. Hello.
Yeah, this is Detective Reagan, New York Police.
Yeah, your Dolly "Change Me doll"
I need to know where it's sold in the Eastern United States.
you what?
are you sure?
okay. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no.
I need you to give me the names and addresses of anyone who had access to one of these dolls.
no, no, no. No call back. I don't have time for you to call back.
you put me on hold, I'll wait. - What's going on?
the doll-- it's a... it's a prototype.
it's not even for sale yet. They made it for test marketing.
three. Three people.
only three people have these dolls.
what are their names?
morning, Lou.
Jim, I'll need to talk to the chief at Manhattan South.
I've got a call in to see if there's any progress on the kidnapping case.
there's nothing solid yet. They're working on a new lead.
Yeah. All right. Yeah.
they found one of the three sample dolls.
belongs to a UN delegate who's over in Shanghai.
she's still over there with the doll.
and doll number two is supposed to be in this dump?
rats in Staten Island live better than this.
who's there?
police. Open the door.
you Oliver Peele? - Yeah.
we need to come inside. - Why? What's going on?
step inside.
what is this place? - What?
mind turning down the music?
man, this is crazy.
Hey, little girl... Hey!
little girl went missing yesterday afternoon. Where were you?
here probably.
you got anybody to verify that?
wait a minute.
change me. I'm wet. - The sample.
he has his. It's not him.
Hey, you can't take that. I'm not done with it yet.
be my guest. Let's go.
aren't you a little old to be playing with dolls?
I'm a reviewer for World of Dolls Magazine?
Oh.
I know what you're thinking, but mothers rely on me.
Reagan. We found it?
Hey, doll number three.
toy salesman named Donald Banse.
no, that's great. Put it out there. Yeah.
What'd they get?
he's got a Florida driver's license, so we got prints and his picture now.
any local address?
his wife's got a New York driver's license with an address right in our own backyard.
should I radio in, let 'em know we're back in service?
could you give me a minute to drink my coffee, kid?
you know, I was also your brother Joe's training officer when he was a new boot?
no kidding? No, I didn't know that.
Yeah. Terrible thing, he got shot.
he was a good guy, your brother.
Yeah, he was.
good guy.
so, I hear you went to Harvard. What are you doing on the beat?
trying to see how the real people live? Writing a book?
it's in the blood, I suppose. - Well, Harvard, that's something we're gonna have to find out.
don't think just 'cause your old man is the boss,
I'm going to be cutting you any slack.
you're going to have to earn it just like everybody else.
Yeah. - Yeah, Joe was a sweetheart.
now, your brother Danny, on the other hand...
Danny's Danny.
Hey, Harvard, I got the last word.
okay? - Yeah.
31 George, reports of a female calling for help, West 4-5.
that's us. - Seems to be in distress...
what are you looking at me for?
get in the car! Go ahead.
I'm not seeing a white van.
Yeah. Can I help you?
we need to talk to your husband. Is he home?
no. No. Why? What's he done?
we just need to talk to him, that's all.
do you mind if we look inside?
I'm telling you, I haven't seen him in months.
I'm-I'm divorcing the bastard.
I just sent him the last box of his stuff.
Oh, yeah? Where?
inwood. The Lincoln Arms.
but I don't know if he's still there.
how much longer we got with this diabetes thing? Couple hours?
if that. Teresa's type 1 diabetes.
she could die of insulin shock.
right up here. Right ahead on the right.
Lincoln Arms Hotel. Right there.
no white van. Blue van.
yeah?
maybe white van, blue paint job.
there's something inside.
Yeah, and he fixed the crack in the window.
gonna have to fix this one, too.
she's not here.
what's this?
a communion dress. - Votive candles.
the good news is, he didn't light 'em yet.
let's check inside. Close it up.
police. Open up.
Donald Banse? - Yes, I am.
how can I help you? Hey. - We're coming inside.
step aside. - He's packing his bags. You going somewhere?
Hey, where's the little girl?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, you do. When you snatched her off the street, you dropped your sample doll in the gutter. Now, where is she?
a doll was stolen from my van.
I was gonna give it to my niece for her first communion.
Oh, you mean the van that you had painted blue and changed the cracked window on?
you know what? I don't even have to talk to you.
I know my rights. Don't talk to us then.
what are you doing? Are you arresting me? - Up against the wall.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say may be used against you in a court of law...
fine, fine. Good. Take me downtown.
my lawyer will have me out in an hour.
then maybe I will see my little niece.
what did you say?
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
come here. Come here. - Get off me!
Danny, let's take him downtown.
get off me! Oh! - Let's take him downtown.
go outside and call it in. - Reagan, let's take him downtown.
we don't have time. The girl needs insulin.
go outside and call it in!
Hey, you gonna tell me where she is? Huh?
all right, get in there. Get in there!
where is she?
go to hell.
you first.
I'm gonna give you one last chance to tell me where she is. Right now.
I don't know.
no? No?
you ready to talk now? Huh?! Huh?!
this storage locker we're going to, the name he rented it under
Monsignor Nicholas, patron saint of kids. - Oh, my God, - I am heartly sorry for having offended thee... - Hey, shut up you!
Hey, just shut your mouth!
you better hope she's still alive.
Hey. Teresa, wake up. Wake up.
no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. You're safe now.
I'm a police officer, okay?
I'm going to get you home, all right?
let me put this on you, all right? Here we go.
I'm going to take this off really quick, okay?
it's going to hurt a little bit, but hold on.
okay. All right. You're going to come with me now.
come on.
you're gonna be okay.
Where's my mama?
you're going to see her real soon.
Where's my mama? - Come on!
it's okay. Listen. These are doctors.
they're going to take you to the hospital, and your mama and papa are going to be there waiting for you, okay?
she needs insulin right away.
Hey. We won one.
Yeah, we did. Doesn't get much better than that.
police brutality!
he tried to drown me. This officer right here tried to drown me.
Mr. Adelman, you have emergency motions to bring in this case?
your Honor, we will be filing a Huntley motion, that any statement my client made or any physical evidence obtained was done so through the use of excessive force.
specifically, an officer waterboarded my client.
in a toilet.
that's a serious allegation.
I have photographs taken at the time of the arrest, Your Honor.
your Honor, the officer contends that the accused was resisting arrest.
he looks pretty banged up to me.
your Honor, since all of the State's evidence is clearly inadmissible, our final motion is that the case be dismissed, and Mr. Banse be released from custody immediately.
you make a compelling case, Mr. Adelman.
no, Your Honor! The accused confessed to kidnapping the girl, and led us to where he had her imprisoned.
ms. Boyle, as heinous as I find the accused's actions, you know the law as well as I do.
any confession illegally coerced is inadmissible, and with no admissible evidence, we have no basis to hold him.
the State pleads for more time, Your Honor.
your Honor... - We don't want this individual on the street.
but at the same time, an officer seems to have taken the law into his own hands, which we cannot abide.
we are looking at the weekend.
I'm going to schedule a hearing on this case for Monday afternoon.
if the State cannot marshal some admissible evidence to indict by then, I will have no choice but to let the accused go.
Hey. What happened? - What happened?
it's a disaster, that's what happened. - Stop with the dramatics, - and just tell me. - What did you think you were doing?
what do you mean, what I was doing? I was saving a little girl's life.
what, so this pervert can go prey on some other girl?
he's probably going to walk because you trashed all the evidence.
we didn't trash the evidence. We got the van in custody.
CSU's all over it for DNA and fibers.
Yeah, well you better hope they find something, or you find something.
you have till Monday. - What do you mean, I only got until Monday?
Monday. Because that's when they're going to let the scumbag go.
you crossed the line, Danny.
get off my case.
Oh, I'll be getting off your case. You're my brother.
I'll have to recuse myself if this goes to trial, but that's a really big "if," isn't it?
anybody home?
Hey, Dad. - Hey.
I got the meat here from Eddie's for tomorrow.
Linda says you should probably take it out about two hours before you go to mass.
I guess you heard.
not the best news.
no. CSU scoured the van.
no fibers, not a single hair.
guess I screwed up, huh?
internal Affairs is going to have to get into this.
just so you know, Demarcus had nothing to do with it.
I told him to call it in.
this whole thing will go down a lot easier if you nail this guy.
I know that, Dad, but I got nothing.
guy had a ritual.
Yeah, I mean, he had the candles, the dress, the communion thing, but that's it.
well... maybe you should run it through VICAP, see if there's any cold cases with the same M.O?
just 'cause the guy doesn't have a record doesn't mean he didn't do it.
right.
cause you don't just wake up one day at 50 and become a pervert.
that's a welcome relief.
Thanks, Chief.
Danny, you ever see that doctor?
well, you know, I've been busy, Dad.
there's no shame talking about what went on in Iraq.
I'll get around to it.
don't forget about the meat.
Whitney, tell them where you've been.
She's-she's been in Alberta, working on a takeover of a Canadian shale oil outfit.
Jamie's the one with the exciting new gig, though, right?
Yeah, how was life on the mean streets today, Jaimer?
a guy pushed his boy down a flight of stairs.
kid's paralyzed.
there's some bad people out there.
I need a cigarette.
excuse me, guys.
I'm sorry.
I know this isn't easy for you, Syd.
what did your mother call it, my little bait and switch?
you fall for a Harvard lawyer and you end up with a cop on the beat.
it isn't about the status or the money or any of that stuff.
I was cheering my head off for you at graduation along with everybody else. Just...
afterwards, I started thinking about your brother Joe.
the reality finally hit me that you're going to be out there every day.
it's where I want to be.
really, I always wanted to be a cop.
Hey, we're going to be okay.
okay?
we better get back in. - Yeah.
most of these kidnaps are custodial.
hold on. I got something.
cold case. Tampa·Florida.
catholic girl right around Teresa's age went missing.
body never found.
when Banse was living there? - What a coincidence.
all right. You keep looking for open cases. I'm going to call down to Tampa, try to get police records and news coverage.
there's got to be something that we can find to tie the guy to this crime.
how many times have we set this table together?
a million.
I remember the first time we didn't set a place for Grandma.
Yeah, I know. I miss her, too.
I wish you had met my Grandma Rose. She was such a riot.
this is her china, you know. - Where is everybody?
that roast is not going to wait.
boys! Guys! Dinner!
I better get those rolls before they're incinerated.
sit next to me at this end of the table.
okay. - Hey, I'm good to go.
something smells awfully good, and it ain't this pip-squeak.
grandpa, can I sit next to you, please? - Sure, squirt.
Staten Island isn't the other side of the world.
it wouldn't kill you to come to our house one Sunday.
Hey, all!
Hey, Jamie. - Hey.
here he is. - Finally.
Where's your girl?
greenwich with her folks.
more for us then. - Hey, where's Danny?
he said he would try to make it.
you all know, right? I'd like to strangle him.
no strangling on Sunday, okay, sunshine?
okay, Pops.
Danny did what he had to do.
well, I knew you would take his side.
I say what I think.
Yeah, and look where it got you.
bless us, Lord, for these gifts which we are about to receive from your bountiful hands through Christ our Lord. Amen.
Amen.
real food.
I don't want any beans. - Yes, you do.
I'll tell you where it got me.
I got a clean conscience, and I can sleep at night.
where what got you?
mom's mad at him because he took your side.
okay, Nicky. Stay out of it, please.
Oh, your mom's riding around on her high horse, huh?
don't make this about me. I'm not the one that slapped some guy around and stuck his head in the toilet.
what do you know about it? - Dad stuck somebody's head in the toilet?
I know you're supposed to be enforcing the law, not making it up as you go along.
you have no idea what goes on.
you only know what you think you know.
the laws are there for a reason.
Yeah, to protect the criminals.
no, to protect society from a police state.
blah, blah, blah, blah.
such a jerk.
Hey, screw you, Erin! - No, screw you.
screw you! - You don't know what I had to... - This is Sunday dinner.
not a free-for-all.
let's keep it civil.
dad, if you're allowed to use force and torture, then you corrupt the moral fiber of the culture.
nobody's in favor of torture.
the issue is the use of enhanced interrogation, is it ever justified?
I say no, and so does John McCain, by the way.
okay then, you've got a ticking bomb.
that guy over there planted it. Lives are at stake.
are his rights more important than innocent victims'?
of course not. See?
Jamie, what do you think? You got a law degree.
and a gun now, too. And it's a lot of power.
you don't govern it, Erin's right. it's a slippery slope.
you just wait, little brother.
you wait until one night you chase some guy down a dark alley and that little object in his hand?
maybe it's a cell phone. Maybe it's not.
it's true. I can say whatever I want, but I don't know what I would have done in his position.
I got to go, Dad.
something up? - The evidence from Tampa came in.
do you want a sandwich or something? You barely touched your food.
no, babe. Thanks. I'll see you boys later.
Bye. - Bye.
Oh, let me ask you one question, Erin.
what if it would've been Nicky, she only had 24 hours left-- what would you want me to do then?
me? - That's not fair.
be honest. Some guy snatches her off the street,
I got a hold of him, and he won't talk?
give me a break.
Nicky? You don't have to worry.
they'd throw her back in ten minutes.
that's not funny.
Thanks, Grandpa.
I'm gonna go watch TV.
Nicky, you were not excused.
you know better.
come on, please?
Sean, you need to get back here.
can we eat dessert in front of the TV?
I got a nice end piece here.
give it to me.
one for the sauce, one for me after that fracas. Jamie?
don't mind if I do.
that kid.
I'll tell Pop to put a governor on the motor.
teenage girls are sensitive creatures, if I remember correctly.
I've got 25 cases on my desk, divorce papers that my ex won't sign, and a brother who thinks I'm Miss Goody Two-shoes?
I mean, doesn't he know that I would shoot this guy myself?
tough week, huh?
Yeah.
sometimes I wish I could just go upstairs to my old room and crawl under the covers like I never left.
the natives are getting restless out there.
are you guys drinking or making dessert?
drinking.
I'd better go help.
your fellow grad with the sharpshooter medal, she's a babe.
who, Maria? Romano? - Good friend?
friend.
how about you, Dad?
you got any good friends in your life?
not a day goes by without me thinking about your mom and what she's missing.
seeing the kids grow up and...
grandkids and...
the ship is in, huh?
Yeah. This is everything from Tampa.
files, tapes, field interviews, photos.
Yeah, all that technology, and what does it come down to?
couple of cops and some beat-up old boxes.
what's going on?
I'm Special Agent Cisco. This is Agent Anderson.
we'd like to talk to you for a minute.
about what?
you ever see one of these before?
what is that?
it's what they give a cop when he's initiated into a group called the Blue Templar.
the Blue Templar?
I thought that was a fairy tale.
my grandfather used to tell me stories about that when I was a kid.
a secret society inside the New York Police Department.
they were real.
they took care of their own and they cleaned up Dodge.
but now we've connected them with extortion, stealing drug evidence, cash, murder for hire.
my father know about this?
you're investigating the department and you haven't told my father?
we don't know how wide this spreads or how high it goes.
that's why we need somebody on the inside.
I'm out of here. - Wait a minute.
there's something you should hear.
it's me. I think I'm in.
I'll let you know when I get a location so I can wire up.
it's me. I think I'm in.
I'll let you know when I get a location so I can wire up.
that's my brother, Joe.
this was his last message to us, the day before he was killed.
he was working with you?
your brother wasn't killed in a bust gone bad.
they made him, then they killed him.
we thought you might want to come work for us?
only halfway through the Tampa evidence, guys.
Hey. Manieri.
come on, wake up. Come on!
we've got three hours left before this creep Banse walks.
all right, all right.
anybody find anything yet?
Yeah, I'm seeing double, Reagan.
Yeah, me, too.
Hey, look who's here.
there he is! -Hey!
how you doing?
we brought you a cake.
you brought me a cake? Did you bake this all by yourself?
you did, huh? Thank you.
we are so grateful you saved our baby.
just glad she's home safe with her family now.
thank you so much.
would you like to have a tour of this big police station?
yeah? Officer, would you take them around?
I'll see you soon, okay?
tell me that doesn't make it all worth it.
except now I'm gonna be the guy that puts that creep Banse back on the street.
some other little girl's gonna end up like our cold case here in Florida.
Demarcus. - Yeah?
come look at this. - What?
this picture. The girl in Florida.
look at that. The cross. The necklace.
let's take a ride.
I can't believe this is happening. My husband isn't a monster.
well, we don't even know yet how many other children he might've took.
Mrs. Banse, I'm afraid we're gonna have to take a closer look at the necklace.
the girl's parents said her name, Kathy, was engraved on the back.
my husband said that's because it's an antique.
we need the cross for evidence, ma'am.
could you remove it, please?
Mrs. Banse, please.
Jay Castleman in the Attorney General's Office, please?
Hi, Jay. It's Erin Boyle, Manhattan D.A.'s Office.
we want your office to initiate proceedings to extradite Donald Banse to Florida for murder with special circumstance.
we have the cross that Kathy MacDonald was wearing when she disappeared in 2005.
Banse gave it to his wife around that time.
Tampa police have located what are believed to be the girl's remains in a storage container in Orlando registered in Banse's alias.
appreciate it. Thank you.
yeah? - Yeah.
beautiful!
they're not shy about exercising capital punishment down in Florida.
Yeah. It's a happy outcome, this time.
just give me this one, will you?
you don't get it, do you?
say hello to the ACLU for me.
you're the one that's gonna need a lawyer, Danny.
you want to talk about that?
probably.
Thanks, sister.
see you.
sorry, the train was stalled.
that's okay; coffee's still hot.
any luck?
no, the damn fish must be changing shifts.
beautiful spot, isn't it?
caught a lot of fish here.
just not today. - Just not tod...
Jamie, you know when you asked me if I was seeing anybody?
I was not forthcoming.
because I am.
that's great.
good.
I hate keeping secrets.
Yeah.
so, Jamie, what's going on?
what do you mean? - Come on, I'm your father.
you having second thoughts about wearing the uniform?
no.
no.
just everything's new.
that T.O. of mine's a piece of work. - Renzulli.
what, are you keeping tabs on me?
I got a vested interest.
join our FRS and have fun! QQ Group No. 37304379
sweet party.
Hey.
uh, last room on the left.
my dad's not home till Friday.
can you believe he brought her?
Seriously? So rude.
whatever. They deserve each other.
this was a bad idea.
come on. Caitlin invited me.
she knows we're together.
girl loves drama.
I say let's give it to her.
Ugh. Piece of trash!
which one?
Yeah, right?
I feel so close to you, Billy.
I know how we can feel even closer.
what's that?
M-CAT. It's new.
I want to do it together.
you'll feel so awesome, I swear.
I don't know, Billy.
there nothing to be afraid of.
it's not addictive.
if she won't do it, I will.
see?
even the captain of the lacrosse team wants to have some.
murderers walking the streets, drunk drivers, and I get hassled for talking on my cell.
you know this is going to put me out of a 3. 5 million showing.
Oh, what, I can't talk now?
in case you haven't noticed, the car's not moving.
just looking out for your safety, ma'am.
Oh, don't give me that righteous BS.
this is about power and money.
you've got the power, so you're taking my money.
I know, do you believe this?
I should get his badge number.
have a nice night, ma'am.
screw you.
okay.
another satisfied customer, huh?
I hate this part of the job.
she's not half wrong, you know.
co wants an increase in activity.
how much activity are we talking?
unwritten rule: one cell phone, three seat belts, 11 miscellaneous per set of tours.
I didn't sign up to be a tax collector.
Oh, yeah?
you should've stuck with that cushy law job.
least you'd get six figures to piss people off.
Yeah.
central to 13-Charlie.
respond to a 10-50 at 1345 West End Avenue.
loud and boisterous complaint.
come on, kid. Let's go make some more friends.
all right.
there's my date.
Wow.
looking good, Dad.
nobody's gonna be looking at him.
Hey, Pancake, what say we break out the Scrabble board?
double or nothing.
maybe later.
I've got homework.
what's with the dark cloud?
she thinks she's too old to be baby-sat.
you know, when you were 14, you were doing the baby-sitting.
maybe you need to loosen the reins a little.
this coming from the man who sent a patrol car to follow me around on prom night.
I never sent a patrol car.
I wouldn't do that to you. It was unmarked.
because we checked the driving record of your date.
big night tonight.
shall we?
thanks for this, Gramps.
Bye, Nicky. I love you.
Bye, Nicky.
nice moves, Sergeant.
Hey.
we got a complaint of some loud noise here.
party on a school night? What's the occasion?
we're just working on a class project.
I'll turn the music down.
this class project involve underage drinking?
no.
are your parents home?
my dad just ran to the store.
guys, come on!
wake up! My God!
what's wrong with them?
back up! Everybody!
what's going on?
Hey, back up! Back up! Hey, kill the music!
Hey, hey, buddy. Hey.
anybody know what they took?
sergeant, I got four minors in need of urgent medical care, 1345 West End Avenue.
nobody leaves!
Hey, buddy, hey, hey, come on, wake up.
Hey, come on, wake up, wake up.
come on, come on, come on. Hey, ma'am?
these three look dead.
I think this one has a chance, Sarge.
anybody know CPR? Huh?
just watch me. Like this.
like this, kid. Come on, help me out.
you'll do fine.
I just hope I don't get emotional during my speech.
you won't.
are you okay?
Oh, I'll be fine.
Hi, J. T. - Ms. Boyle.
how about I go inside?
save me a dance.
what do we got?
apparent drug overdose
four St. Angelus students at a party.
three boys age 17, and a 16-year-old girl.
the, uh, boys were DOA at the scene.
girl was resuscitated and transferred to Columbia Prez.
what kind of poison are we talking about?
we don't know, sir. It's a new one to us.
some kind of designer drug called M-CAT.
do we know the source?
well, we're chasing it down now, boss.
setting up operations in suspected buy areas.
conducting full enforcement sweeps.
debriefing the partygoers and the survivor.
how's she doing?
stabilized.
she has a Reagan to thank.
first on scene, saved her life.
what else?
that's it.
there's something else.
no. It's just that you're with your family.
you're entitled to a life.
you did right, J. T.
press will be all over this.
keep me updated. - You got it, boss.
Hey, Alyson. How you feeling?
who are you?
I'm Jamie, the police officer who brought you here.
police officer?
Yeah. I just wanted to see how you were.
my head's fuzzy.
side effect of the Narcan,
I think. Uh...
it's what they gave you to counteract the drugs in your system.
what drugs?
you don't remember?
Where's Billy?
did Billy get sick, too?
maybe I better get a doctor.
where is he? Is he okay?
why won't you tell me where he is?
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
no.
what's going on?
she was asking what happened to her boyfriend.
I don't know what to tell her.
so you told her?
I didn't know what to say.
wait outside.
Alyson, hi.
I'm Detective Curatola.
this is Detective Reagan.
honey, I know you're really upset.
I need to ask you a few questions, though.
this isn't real.
look, Alyson, we need to ask you some questions about the party.
we got to figure out how this happened.
do you recognize this?
Oh.
Billy said it was a new kind of drug.
it was supposed to make you feel good.
do you know where Billy got the stuff from?
I don't know anything about any of this.
I don't do drugs.
it was just this once.
you're a lucky young lady.
what happened to the other guys that Billy gave it to?
they didn't make it.
Oh.
no.
Alyson, listen.
it is very important that we figure out where this stuff came from so we can stop other people from dying.
do you understand?
Hey, look, can you tell us anything?
did you hear any names?
did anyone say anything to you?
no, nobody said anything to me.
they don't talk to me.
Caitlin and the others...
Billy's friends, not mine.
look, your mom's on her way.
you're gonna be all right.
nice work, kid.
our only witness, you got to turn on the waterworks?
I'm sorry, Danny.
it's fine.
she would have found out eventually anyway.
sometimes you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't.
I heard about what you did.
saving her life. Good job, kid.
what happened, they just overdose?
we don't know yet.
we have to wait on the tox screens back from the deceased and the residue on the baggies, so...
freaking designer drugs on the street nowadays.
it's a wonder these kids even know what they're putting up their noses.
we have to lean hard on every kid at that party to find the dealer.
let's start with the one who threw the party.
that will never help your cause.
do you understand? - Fine. And I promise,
I'll text you every step of the way.
okay.
Oh, my God.
what is it?
three seniors from St. Angelus OD'd on drugs last night.
I know kids that go there.
my daughter does not do drugs.
well, we know she didn't take those drugs because she's not dead.
now, Caitlin, can you tell us who Billy Romero - bought the drugs from? - No, she can't.
how about you let her answer the question, sir?
no, I can't.
how do you think this makes me feel?
three people died in my apartment.
I have to live with that.
can't you see you're upsetting her? This is not her fault.
look, if you want to play the blame game,
I'd hold you responsible.
I trust Caitlin.
this started out as an innocent get-together.
it was those kid who took advantage of her.
kids. Okay?
that's the operative word in the sentence-- kids.
there's a reason that the legal age of majority is 18.
now you're an adult. Act like it.
let her help us with the investigation.
I've done nothing illegal.
a 16-year-old can be left alone in a secure building.
now are we done here? - No, we're not done here.
Caitlin, I'm going to ask you one more time.
where did Billy get that drug?
I said I don't know.
Caitlin, when your dad said that you're 16
and you can be home alone now because you're a big girl, well, that also means that we can charge you as an adult and we can arrest you right now.
what?
are you trying to scare her?
no. Nothing like that.
but when we cuff her and bring her down to central booking...
this is outrageous.
no, actually it's the law, sir, okay?
everybody at that party could be charged for possession of an illegal substance.
so just be glad you were away on business, or I'd arrest you. Now sit your ass down.
Caitlin, you still say you don't know anything?
who sold Billy that drug?
someone at school.
who? I need a name.
I don't know who.
I think they buy it at school, but I'm telling you the truth.
I don't do drugs.
that's good for now.
Oh, boy,
I'm having flashbacks already.
I'm surprised I didn't lose any nerve endings the amount of time Father Peter whacked me across the knuckles with a ruler.
hm, well, you're looking at the recipient of the Christian Leadership Award, - four years running. - Yeah?
wow, I wouldn't have pegged you for a Goody Two-shoes.
well, until I discovered boys that is.
and then I was hiking up my uniform skirt.
sister Beatrice caught me one day and she said the shorter the skirt, the longer the confession.
great. Now I get to imagine you in that plaid uniform all day.
don't listen to him, ladies.
I know what you people face out there in the city, but this is St. Angelus.
none of our students are dealing hard drugs.
do you have any idea who this person is?
that's what we're here to find out.
that's not to say that some incidents of marijuana and alcohol use don't occur, - Okay. - but
vice Principal Hoffman here is trained and she knows the signs.
I test if I see fit.
and get those few proper help.
great. Well, we're still going to need to see your surveillance videos, Father.
we don't have any.
it's not in our budget.
and the Lord handles surveillance here at St. Angelus.
the...
you got me on that one, Father.
father Leo, look, we'd love to talk to the students, but we can't do it without the parents' permission.
and you have 450 students here, so we simply don't have the time.
but the school lockers here are on school property.
so we'd like to take a look at them, with your permission, of course.
you want to search everyone's locker?
pretty much.
that's such an invasion of privacy.
well, three kids are dead, Father.
I mean, if you want to cause an epidemic...
of course not.
but I don't have the authority to sanction the opening of lockers.
father... - There are rules here.
I need to go through proper channels.
talk to my superior.
okay. Well, you talk to your higher power and I'll talk to mine.
it's a long way from St. Brendan's.
for both of us.
well, this isn't a social visit, is it, Francis?
the police need access to St. Angelus High School, Your Excellency.
please understand, Commissioner, giving permission to open those lockers has ramifications.
are they more important than seeing that more kids don't die?
our parents are protective of their children.
if we open the lockers and treat everyone as a suspect, there will be outrage and rightly so.
you are criminal by association.
by the mere fact that you attended school at St. Angelus.
we need to find out who is manufacturing this drug and seize it.
we need to find out who else has it.
if we open the lockers, how many parents will pull their kids from St. Angelus?
and then there will be one less Catholic high school.
I don't want to have to get a court order.
it will get out. And once again the church will appear to be uncooperative.
with respect, you can't afford to be seen to be sweeping another problem under the rug.
I'll call Father Leo.
thank you, Father.
God bless you, Francis.
thank you.
I need all the help I can get.
what do you got?
locker 300, another 20 sack of weed.
that would be Tom Ryder.
he's in English classroom 5-C.
looks like we?
okay, okay.
let's see what you got here, boy.
what do we got here?
where? In here?
good boy. Good boy.
all right, all right, all right.
all right.
what do we got here?
Oh, false bottom.
Ooh, good boy.
what do you think, Father? Nice?
locker 291-- who's that?
algebra, room 7-A.
we're looking for Wayne Foster.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
stop! Hey!
didn't anyone ever teach you that flight's an admission of guilt?
glad you can still feel something.
three other people are dead.
Yeah, okay. Make that five.
got two more OD's.
DOA at Astoria General.
imagine that.
Wayne, you're looking at three counts of criminally negligent homicide.
not to mention the countless drug charges you're facing.
you understand what that means, kid?
Yeah. A lot of prison time for you.
now the only way I can help you is if you help me get this poison off the streets.
I need the name of your supplier and the names of any kids you sold the M-CAT to.
Wayne, give me a name.
I didn't sell to Billy.
not this time at least.
okay, who did?
I don't know.
okay, then who sold it to you?
I don't know his name.
I never met him. - Wayne, where did you get the stuff?!
through Turbolist.
anyone can.
you bought it on the Internet?
okay. Come show me how.
adventures of Radar Mouse, number seven.
timely Comics, 1949. Best offer.
what does that mean?
well, it's bogus.
timely Comics only published through number four, and that was in 1946.
who knew?
the numbers are the code. - Uh-huh.
49 minus 46.
so 300 divided by four, which means he has 75 bags available at 17 a pop.
okay, okay, listen, the math-- you're killing me, kid.
make an order, all right?
how about $500?
and how long does something like this usually take before he gets back to you?
Oh.
Oh, okay, that answers that question.
sending parcel post at Chelsea COD four dollars.
parcel post means the mail slot in Chelsea.
four dollars means it will be waiting for me by 4: 00 p. m.
Yeah, except it will be waiting for us.
good work, kid.
you get high in your crazy high school days?
what kind of question is that?
an honest one.
Yeah, in college.
dated this bassist.
he was in a grunge band.
he was hot.
and he liked to smoke pot, so...
so he's hot, so you just did it, too, huh?
we always pushed boundaries back then.
the kids today
the boundaries they're pushing though, so much more dangerous.
what a coincidence.
he's a friend of ours.
I just messenger.
what's in the envelope?
I just messenger, senorita.
just messenger, yeah.
we get it-- don't kill the messenger, right?
okay, tell you what tell us where this came from, we won't kill you.
yeah? Eh!
the bike shop.
the bike store, huh?
stop! Stop!
david Carvell, you're under arrest.
come here and cuff this mutt.
what for?
I import quality bicycles.
yeah? Well, you should have used one.
you might have got away.
you all right?
Oh, Reagan, check this out.
this guy, Carvell, has got a major drug lab in the back.
a lot of high-end bicycles.
Hey, keep him down here.
back here.
Oh, look what we have here.
Mmm. Look at that.
guess the cat's out of the bag, huh?
Mm-hmm. - You gonna bag that?
I'm gonna put the cat back in the bag.
all right. - Okay.
five dead kids.
you know, scumbags like you, you really make my blood boil.
What'd you lace it with-- arsenic, strychnine?
you have your facts wrong, Detective.
my brand is pure.
huh. Looks like pure poison to me.
I'm a businessman.
consistency brings repeat customers.
my brand is popular because it's reliable.
Mm. Okay.
test it, you'll see.
Oh, we're gonna test it, believe me.
now get him outta my face.
looking at a spike in gadget thefts on the subway since that new PDA came out, but we're on it, boss.
tomorrow's press conference has been pushed to 1300 hours, and then there's the renaming dedication at the Police Athletic League boxing gym.
I imagine you're wanting to wear the uniform for that.
what about M-CAT?
we're waiting for lab results to come back.
well...
they have.
Hey.
Hey, there he is.
what's going on?
Oh, you know.
Ronnie, two pints.
you got it, Danny.
Sydney's got dinner waiting, so I, uh...
Hey, it's one beer with your brother, all right?
the old man always said to celebrate your victories.
you saved a girl's life.
feel good about it.
you got a major drug dealer off the street.
to the good guys. - Hey!
Hey, Jackie.
Hello, hello.
you remember Jamie?
Yes, of course. Hey. Hey.
okay, so... I have bad news and worse news.
give me the less bad news.
all right-- the OD's in Queens-- meth heads.
there's no connection.
what a world when that's a relief.
exactly.
uh, and the tox screen came back on our dead boys.
it was a lethal dose of potassium chloride.
I'm not really a science geek.
it's a common chemical used in fertilizers and-and water softeners.
it's not used in recreational drugs.
they also use it in death row inmates, for lethal injections.
my three months on the Innocents Project.
well, the M. E. said that a high enough concentration of potassium chloride, mixed with the sedative effect of heroin, can stop a heart like that.
that Carvell's a real son of a bitch, huh?
Yeah, and that's the worse news: It's not Carvell.
the lab tested the M-CAT that came from Carvell's shop and tested the M-CAT from Wayne Foster's sample
it was heroin, Mephedrone and baby laxative.
neither one had potassium chloride.
great. Carvell told the truth.
all right, so we got one packet of M-CAT with potassium chloride.
Carvell didn't put it in there-- who did?
the only thing I'm thinking is that maybe
Billy wanted a bigger high, and put it in there.
maybe somebody else did, looking to kill.
if that's true, we've been coming at this all wrong.
if they did, then who was the target?
was it Billy Romano, Alyson, you know, one of the friends, all four of 'em?
the only person we can ask, at this point, is Alyson Duvitz.
I'm gonna go ask Alyson now, 'cause she just got run down on Riverside Drive, going out for a jog.
Ronnie! Put it on my tab.
you buy next time, kid.
how's she doing?
she's one lucky girl.
she turned and saw it just in time.
car clipped her, took off.
Alyson, Detective Reagan.
my partner, Detective Curatola.
we met you at the hospital. You remember?
can you tell me what happened?
I don't know.
I was running, trying to clear my head, get everything out of my system...
something made me turn back, and there was a car coming straight at me.
did you see the driver?
the headlights were in my eyes.
how about the car?
could you make out the model or make?
it was medium-sized...
uh, dark color.
it wasn't an SUV or anything.
new York license plate?
it all happened so fast.
I think I did see a bumper sticker for my school, though.
I don't know, I could be imagining it.
okay.
look, Alyson, we think that somebody may have deliberately poisoned Billy and his friends, and you, too.
and from what you're telling us now, looks like they tried to hurt you again.
Oh, my God, this can't be happening.
look, is there anyone you can think of who may have wanted to do something like this, to Billy, to you...
Caitlin hates me, I know that.
because of Billy?
she said that she broke up with him, and he said it was the other way around...
you said she hates you.
Yeah, well, I'm all over her hate book.
hate book? Is that what it sounds like?
some of the girls have them.
they're like journals of everyone they hate.
I saw it once, in chemistry class.
there's some really mean stuff.
about Billy, too.
and Caitlin took chemistry as well?
her, me and Billy were in the same class.
it's hard to believe that Caitlin Breyer is capable of murder.
she can be difficult, moody, but...
look at this.
look at this.
what's that?
I just found some mysterious white powder in Caitlin's lab station.
it's not in anyone else's.
you know what it is?
no.
you know, they can do that at the lab.
Yeah, I know.
I couldn't help myself.
Oh! - Ooh!
potassium chloride.
how do you know that?
potassium turns violet when over heat.
looks like somebody's Catholic school education paid off.
by they way-- hate book.
found it in Caitlin's locker.
wait you'll get a load of this:
I wish that bitch was dead.
her and Billy both.
I'd like to set them both on fire and watch them burn and beg me for water.
lovely.
teenage girls love to vent.
it's second nature to them. Like breathing.
that doesn't mean she'd actually kill someone.
right.
so she didn't mean any of this stuff in this book, huh?
read this yet, Dad?
good stuff.
well, I loved Billy.
I would never really kill him.
okay, what about with Alyson?
she had Billy and you wanted him.
no, I didn't want Billy anymore.
I dumped him, okay?
that's not what we heard.
well, all Billy ever wanted to do was have sex and get high, - and it got worse... - You two had sex?
well, he kept wanting me to do this drug with him.
he said it would bring us closer.
and, I mean, I'm sorry, but if you're dating me, you don't need chemicals.
Mm! - Course not.
and then I find out that he was sneaking behind my back with Alyson.
no, this is before Alyson.
and he even admitted to it, but he wouldn't tell me who it was.
and I didn't care anymore, anyway.
Oh, so he had a secret lover.
okay.
let's talk a little bit more about Alyson's accident, okay?
okay.
you already asked me. I said I didn't do it.
all right, so, where were you between 6: 00 and 7: 00 last night?
Caitlin has Pilates on Friday night.
dad! Dad... with the questions.
let the girl answer.
well...
actually, I didn't go.
I went shopping in SoHo.
you lied about that, too?
can you verify that?
can anyone verify that?
do you have any receipts from your little shopping trip?
no, but... I tweeted the whole time.
you can ask Sara and Rachel.
they'll tell you everywhere I went.
or if you have an account, you could go back and follow me yourself.
you can follow her on Twitter.
she told you to follow her on Twitter.
look, we got the hate book, - we got motive, - Yeah. Yeah.
her alibi from last night is very thin...
all right, we'll check out her alibi.
we'll squeeze her friends.
if her story doesn't pan out, then we nail her. Come on.
that's why I don't have kids.
this is a nice piece? - Thank you.
no, that's good.
you know, they say you can get hooked on heroin after one try.
how do you protect your kids from that?
shackles.
Mm. You think she's kidding.
we learned about drugs in school, Mom.
good.
tell 'em what your grandpa did, Danny.
Oh, you knew about that, huh?
I'm your father.
I did my own version of "Scared Straight," with your dad and your Uncle Joe.
I took them down to the Tombs and locked 'em in.
what's the Tombs?
jail. - It's a jail.
and it was full of drunk guys who were passed out and puking all over the place, and me and Joe-- what was Joe, about eight back then
were scared out of our minds.
I told them that's where people go when they do drugs.
and you guys had all the fun.
Yeah, Dad did the same thing to me when I turned 11.
he did?
and how old are you, Jack?
ten.
Ooh...
he's not going in the Tombs.
you know, a lot of people think drugs should be made legal.
Yeah, a lot of crazy people.
what? It is in California:
medical marijuana. - Yeah, well, that's California.
what do you expect?
well, it's not legal here.
and for good reason.
drugs make your teeth fall out.
I'm just saying there's no scientific proof that some drugs are more harmful than, say, alcohol.
well, there's an argument to be made for legalization.
there's a stupid argument for legalization.
you just watched three kids die.
and you, you know kids who knew these kids.
if drugs were regulated like alcohol, and standards were quality-controlled, deciding who can sell it, and to whom.
and to whom?
shut up, Danny.
you think there's gonna be less junkies on the street if heroin suddenly becomes legal?
where do you get these theories?
you sit around your dorm in college smoking pot with your buddies, and you just come up with this crap?
look, at least users would know what they're getting;
pushers and dealers would be out of business;
maybe these kids would be alive.
see? - I doubt it.
my Uncle Emmett went blind drinking a bad batch of bathtub gin in Prohibition.
what? - Excuse me?
true story.
right, Prohibition gave rise to bootleggers like Al Capone.
we should be able to do what we want.
it's a free country.
that's a little simplistic, honey.
no, it's not.
I'm just saying it's a complicated issue.
you think I don't know that?
you never take me seriously.
honey, I... - No, I just, I won't have an opinion from now on, okay?
excuse me.
Oh, dear.
and that is why I'm glad I have boys.
Amen.
I got this one.
can I have her chicken?
I'm sorry, Grandpa.
Hey, you made some good points.
she treats me like a child.
Oh, you're not mad at her because she changed her mind about letting you go into town.
nobody else could go either, after what happened at that party, just...
she never talks to me.
I mean, really talks.
your Grandpa Henry ever tell you his theory about the Reilly side of the family being emotionally constipated?
you know, the other night, when you were going to the gala, she was crying the whole way over to your house, and she wouldn't tell me why.
well, maybe she's trying to be strong for you right now.
knowing how upset you are about the divorce.
Yeah.
it sucks.
you know what your mom was doing that night?
Yeah. It was her first night as the president of the Children's Fund.
Yeah.
did you know that your grandma, her mom, was president of the same charity before she died?
maybe your mom was thinking about her.
missing her.
you were thinking about her, too.
I was.
but I was trying to be strong for your mom.
just like you need your mom, your mom needs you.
to look out for her, to understand her, and love her.
life isn't fair.
but you can be.
morning.
Oh, come here. Check this out.
this Twitter thing.
it not only records the times of your tweets but it tracks your location with a GPS.
look at this.
I had our tech guys put her coordinates into our mapping system.
6: 07 p. m. OMG, skirt at H&M to die for.
okay. - Mm-hmm.
6: 10 p. m. Saw a girl in fringed top. So last year.
Mmm.
6: 12"-- This girl tweets every five seconds.
I know.
6: 12 p. m. Froyo for dinner." Okay.
okay, so, her last tweet was at Prince and Broadway.
and it's at the exact same time that Alyson Duvitz was hit with the car, miles away.
assuming it was Caitlin that was sending the tweets...
who ran down Alyson?
what about that secret lover Caitlin was talking about?
if she even exists.
it's worth going back to the school one more time and taking a look.
well, whoever it was, they tried to kill Alyson Duvitz twice, so what do they say? Third time's the charm?
janitor said both sides of the street are reserved for St. Angeles personnel only.
parents are calling, asking what you're doing.
well... you can tell the concerned parents we're investigating a triple homicide at their children's school.
and also a hit-and-run on Alyson Duvitz.
by examining cars?
Yeah. In fact, we're looking for a dark sedan.
would you happen to know who may have a St. Angelus bumper sticker on their car?
well, anyone. You can get them for a dollar in the supply room.
the way things are going, I won't be able to give them away.
Yeah, it's tough stuff, Father.
thank you.
you have work to do, and I've got a school to run.
Hey! Jackie.
look at this.
dark sedan...
no bumper sticker though.
well, that's just it.
looks like somebody removed the bumper sticker here and ran this car through a wash.
Yeah, like a hit-and-run trying to cover tracks.
Yeah. Call it in.
Yeah. Curatola.
Yeah, um, check a New York plate for me: ABZ1873.
Oh!
looks like somebody scrubbed this fender here, trying to get rid of some light green paint.
car's registered to Vice Principal Carol Hoffman.
father, Father!
can we ask you a question?
what can you tell us about Vice Principal Hoffman?
the students love her. I get no complaints.
despite the fact that, as vice principal, she's often called upon to mete out discipline and resolve disputes.
she ever have any disciplinary issues with Billy Romero?
not that I'm aware of.
any interactions we should know about?
well, he can thank her for not flunking out sophomore year.
how so?
he was failing science, and she tutored him.
she tutored him in science?
Yeah, she was a chemistry teacher.
before I promoted her.
well, thanks for, uh, letting us take another look, Ms. Hoffman.
we appreciate it.
I could be more help if I knew what you were looking for.
well, actually, uh...
we're not looking for anything.
why don't you have a seat?
I really should be getting back to my office.
Oh, it won't take long.
so Father Leo says that, uh, you taught chemistry here.
Mm-hmm. Before I became vice principal.
Oh. And Billy Romero was one of your students.
good student?
average. - average.
do you always give "A"s out to average students?
he did some extra credit.
extra credit. Funny.
I've never heard it called that before.
ms. Hoffman, you're an intelligent woman.
I think you know what we're getting at with these questions.
I'm going to go get Father Leo.
no, no, no. Sit down, please. Really.
you see, it was you who tried to run down Alyson Duvitz with a car, and it was you who planted the potassium chloride in Caitlin's lab station, thinking it would throw us off.
that's a lie.
what was it? Hmm?
you couldn't find somebody your own age to have sex with, so you picked a 17-year-old kid?
shut your mouth.
I know, I know. You're needy.
right? Is that your problem?
you're clingy?
he was so disgusted with himself that he had to take drugs just to have sex with you? Is that it?
he loved me.
and I loved him.
he didn't love you.
okay? The fact is that he couldn't stand the sight of you, and he wanted to get as far away from you as possible.
I begged him.
I begged him not to leave me.
I told him he was making a big mistake.
so if you couldn't have him, then no one could?
he wouldn't even look at me!
he wouldn't talk to me.
right. So you decided to give him and his girlfriend a going-away present.
hmm?
what, did you just get lucky, and get the other two kids by chance?
I didn't think he'd share it.
right.
you... you don't know what it's like.
to have somebody. Just to be with somebody.
I didn't need to see him all the time, just once in a while.
right.
Carol Hoffman, you're under arrest for the murder
have things gotten worse?
or am I just nostalgic for a time that never existed?
little bit of both, I think.
uh.
occurs to me we both deal with good and evil, and human frailty.
they've got Ms. Hoffman on suicide watch at Bellevue.
poor creature.
I feel responsible we let an unbalanced woman into our school.
heal the wounded, bind up those who are bruised, and reclaim the sinners.
the Franciscan motto above my door at St. Brendan's.
easy to say. Harder to live by.
Yeah.
I talked to the cardinal.
he's agreed to let me hold a press conference.
no more sweeping things under the rug.
you may need divine intervention.
the press will be more interested in creating heat than shedding light.
if you'll have me, I would like to stand with you, Father.
just as you've always been there for the Reagans.
thank you, Francis.
thank you.
Hi. It's me.
we're in the kitchen.
rossellini dumped an identity theft on my lap as I was trying to make my escape.
I'm sorry that I missed... dinner.
you didn't miss dinner.
what is all this?
pops and Grandpa and I made dinner.
eggplant parmesan, yams, arugula salad...
and for dessert, red velvet cupcakes.
although, full disclosure we bought those.
all of my favorites.
it was Nicky's idea.
thank you, sweetie.
come on. Before it gets cold.
well, this all looks delicious.
the eggplant parmesan?
way harder than I thought it was going to be.
Yeah, dipping the slices in the egg and getting all the flour to stick?
it can be tricky.
Yeah.
to Grandma.
to Grandma.
to Mom.
to Mary.
thank you, Lord, for these blessings which we are about to receive through Your bountiful hands. Amen.
king, can I get in?
you two, come on.
these two.
Hey! Hey, remember me?
not tonight. King, just the two of us.
you. Come on, over here.
come on, man.
looking good, King.
not you, just her.
sorry.
Seriously?
you.
Hey. King, you remember me!
you look gorgeous tonight. Hey, King.
friends, come on, very nice.
you're not on the list.
what list?
my list.
you forget who the hell I am, King?
Yeah, I remember you're the suit who's not getting in.
Oh, ha. King? Me?
you think I'm a joke.
let's see how wise you crack when I put a Glock 9 in your face.
you and what hedge fund?
king is dead!
the King is dead!
he's crazy. You're toast, man!
you. You're over!
good.
listen, keep your hand this is to protect yourself.
keep those hands up at all times.
come on, right there.
all right, one, two, come on, one, two.
Oh! Ah, you got to watch the left.
Sean-o, you're up, come on.
sit down, stay right there, and let your brot...
watch the right, Dad.
what are you doing? Watch the right.
knucklehead.
what are you doing? Okay.
all right, enough roughhousing.
give your dad a hug.
he's working nights this week;
you're not gonna see a lot of him. All right.
no, five minutes. No, five more minutes.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Time for bed.
upstairs, and get ready for bed.
I'll be up in a minute. Thank you.
go.
that was unfair, I wasn't ready.
brush your teeth.
I'm gonna miss you this week.
Yeah. I hate when you work night watch.
I know, nothing good happens after midnight.
that's right, so you be safe out there.
I will. And watch your left.
watch your right, watch, watch...
Yeah, I know.
you bet, Jimmy.
looking forward to tomorrow.
Oh, and happy anniversary.
happy anniversary?
Oh, inside joke with an old partner.
ha-ha, Jimmy Burke of the 2-1.
I thought I heard something slithering.
he ain't perfect, but he's my partner.
isn't that what somebody I know used to say?
you couldn't inherit your mother's cooking, right?
you had to get that elephant memory of hers.
Yeah, but I got your sunny disposition.
wait, the 2-1.
weren't you involved in a shooting up there?
I was.
you never really told us about that.
well, son, you were young.
last thing I wanted you kids to think about was your old man could have bought it on a rooftop in Harlem.
it was that close?
close enough where I call him each year on the anniversary.
I got to turn in; I got a big day tomorrow.
good night.
night, Dad.
good night, Francis.
night, Pop.
Jimmy Burke took two bullets that were meant for your dad.
he spent six months out line of duty.
I don't get it, Grandpa.
how could you have a beef with the guy that saved Dad's life?
looks like your king is in trouble.
I love this city at night, Jackie.
Oh, listen to this record.
going out tonight...
come on, sing it.
Danny and Jackie are goin' out tonight.
you enjoying yourself, Reagan?
how could I not be? Come on.
we just took a statement from a six-four transsexual escort who thinks her Labradoodle was dognapped by her shrink.
how can I not be having fun right now?
I'm telling you, Jack, they can keep Central Park and Times Square.
this is the New York that I love the one you never see on a postcard.
now, there's an untapped market tranny hooker postcards.
come on, tell me there's anywhere you'd rather be right now than out on the streets with me.
Yeah, my bed. Your bed?
what are you talk...? Then move to Jersey, Jackie.
come on, this is the city that never sleeps.
can't beat this place.
I heart New York.
I know, I know.
king, let me in.
get down! Get down!
DOA was right here Richard King, 27, aka King the doorman from the club.
CSU puts the shooter somewhere out in the street.
eyewitnesses?
got about a couple dozen people trying to get into the club, but everybody's looking this way.
all right, so shots ring out, everybody scrambles, plus they're all drunk.
by the time they get their bearings, our shooter's in the wind.
almost like you've done this before, Detective.
Yeah, once or twice.
so nobody's eyes were working. What about their ears?
witnesses confirm hearing one shot.
vic caught it in the neck.
I see one eyeball that wasn't snockered.
anyone here from the club we can talk to?
owner's right over there.
Sabrina Glick she owns this place?
what, you know her?
no, not really, just what I read about her.
she's a Page Six staple.
you'd like her she only comes out at night.
let me know if you want help questioning her, Detective, huh?
that's funny. Get lost.
go.
I'd just come out to check on things.
I was about 20 feet away when it happened.
but you didn't see who shot him?
you'll see it all on there.
actually, the shooter's out of frame there.
where were you again?
I'm right over there.
you have any other cameras, another angle?
can't see much of anything here.
well, we're going to need to take this for evidence.
you know, TARU can enhance the video, maybe expand the view.
Yeah.
um, what can you tell us about this guy King?
what kind of guy was he?
he was Brad Pitt in Thelma & Louise.
he just popped.
two months after I put him on the rope, he put us on the map.
we've been the hottest club in New York ever since.
we're still talking about the door guy here?
djs and doormen the new celebrities.
they're the real stars around here.
I mean, all due respect.
I worked the door at the Vault back in the days.
so, what happened, you're too old now?
too married and two kids.
too bad.
okay, well, uh, any girlfriends, jealous lovers uh, King have any of those?
he's been with Benita Ginn ever since I've known him.
she's a night nurse at the downtown hospital.
beautiful, sweet, not exactly the murdering type.
how about someone with a grudge?
any enemies?
only the rest of the city.
you know, these doormen they're the one person in the city that can say no to the rich and powerful.
did King piss anyone off last night?
Yeah, you know, I didn't think about that before, but the bouncers did mention that one of our guys got pretty angry with King last night when he turned him away.
how angry?
angry enough to threaten to come back with a gun, but like I said...
do you know a name?
he runs one of the biggest funds on the street, but...
you know how these guys are, I mean...
well, do you know where we can find this Vince Walker?
he's in your phone?
Yeah, anyone who's anyone is in my phone.
I'm not in her phone.
130 North Moore, Tribeca.
Thanks.
let's flag this guy credit cards, phone, and, uh, license.
could be a flight risk.
Oh, and if you happen to think of anything else, don't hesitate to call.
I won't, Danny.
Oh, and, um...
you, too.
Thanks.
she's doing her residency in Laguna.
can you believe that a doctor in the family?
I don't know what's harder to believe little Mary-Kathleen is a doctor or there's a Bronx Burke living in Laguna.
ain't that the truth.
something on your mind, Jimmy.
word's going around that Deputy Chief Russo is going to pull the plug.
he puts in his papers this week.
any chance I'd be considered for the spot?
being number two at Manhattan South'd be a stepping stone, and the bump to chief it wouldn't hurt.
you're not happy in the 15th?
Oh, no, no, not at all. I'm having a ball there, but I've been the C. O. for three years.
I'm ready for the next challenge.
your numbers are pretty good.
and they're getting better.
I'm facing the firing squad at CompStat this week.
I think your guys are going to like what they hear.
well, you know how I do things, Jimmy.
I won't do contracts, but if you're right for the job, you'll be in the mix.
well, that's all I'm asking to be considered.
what is this, a GQ photo shoot?
Hey, Erin Reagan, as I live and breathe.
what's going on?
breakfast with Judge Walters.
he's been killing me on my search and seizures, so I thought maybe some hash browns would soften him up.
he's on a no-carb diet.
Oh, come on, sit down.
it's like having flowers at the table.
you want some coffee?
Yeah, I'll join you boys.
doorman says we just missed him.
this guy is in the wind, Jack.
wall Street heliport. What's up?
real Time just got a hit on the guy's AmEx.
he rented a chopper.
you think he's going sightseeing?
Yeah.
Hey, hey, kill that right now!
you, put your hands in the air!
put your hands where I can see 'em!
I didn't do it!
What?! I didn't do it!
Oh, you didn't do it?! No.
Oh, okay.
well, get back in the chopper and enjoy your trip.
he's taking off, everyone. He didn't do it.
thank you.
he's kidding, moron.
get over there. Let's go.
over here.
my guy didn't do it. Is that why he booked the helicopter to take him to a private jet to take him to Cuba?
Yeah, one of the few countries we don't have an extradition treaty with?
he was nervous; he knew it wouldn't look good.
but I can assure you my client is an upstanding member of the community.
no, your client's a scumbag, okay?
but being that we're the kinder, gentler NYPD, if he's got a good alibi, we're all ears.
otherwise, it's three hots and a cot, courtesy of the City of New York.
fine, Detective.
go to Hell.
no pun intended, but what the hell is this place?
dominatrix dungeon.
don't tell me, you heart this New York, too.
Oh, God.
people have a common misconception about what we do here. - I bet.
for the most part, most of our clients are average citizens.
many of them are highly successful businessmen.
right. In other words, you beat the crap out of spoiled rich guys who hate themselves.
it's a bit more complicated than that, Detective.
I'm sure it is.
you know, I had a guy ask me to lick his boots once.
I broke his nose instead.
well, he should have known better.
you don't seem to be the submissive type.
lady, if I take out my handcuffs, I'm not playing.
don't touch me.
fine. Like I said, Mr. Walker was, in fact, here
so unless you'd like me to give you a complimentary whipping or you'd like to give me a spanking...
...I'll see you out.
actually, we're not quite ready to go yet.
Ouch, that hurt.
I'm sure it does.
not that you exactly strike me as the girl-next-door type, but you got any proof other than your say-so?
move! Come on! See the time code here?
like I said, 3:25 a. m.
harder! Woof!
this guy manages a $700 million fund?
Yeah, and we wonder why our economy's in the toilet.
is that a diaper?
I think it is.
he's a good boy!
good morning, CompStat panel.
the 15th Precinct is proud to report a reduction of 20% in violent crime across the board in the last three reporting periods.
Ten-hut!
as you were.
inspector, let's talk about the strong-arm robberies in the vicinity of the 68th Street Station.
what were your deployment tactics there?
I employed a two-tiered strategy.
my anticrime units gave it special attention;
I increased the plain-clothes presence in the station itself.
the 7-4 had a similar situation in La Guardia Park.
those same deployment tactics proved unsuccessful.
any thoughts as to why? Well, I can't speak for the 7-4, sir, but at the 15th, we hit them hard, we hit them often, and over time, those are the results we achieved.
all right, let's move on to burglaries.
your numbers are down considerably.
care to enlighten us as to why?
I started a burglary task force, picked out my youngest, sharpest officers.
seems to be working.
and where could you be improving?
where could we not, Commissioner?
thank you, Inspector. Carry on.
let's turn our attention to the rash of push-in robberies, Inspector.
look who's here. Hey, you're home.
Hey. Just trying to catch a few hours sleep before I head back out there.
hey...!
what are you doing! What are you doing! Daddy's home!
what are you doing! Hey, Dad!
easy, you guys. Come on. What are you doing!
watch your uniform. What are you doing!
what are you doing! What are you doing! Daddy!
don't forget, we have dinner at your father's house tonight.
he's out of town this weekend.
I'll be there, I'll be there. Mommy, what's that?
who's Sabrina?
that's a witness in the case.
she writes her number on a cocktail napkin?
come on, she owns a nightclub what do you want me to do?
Oh, a nightclub. Great.
Danny's favorite old stomping grounds.
kids, get in the car.
we'll be late for school. Bye, boys.
Bye.
love you.
love you, too.
a mysterious stranger is on his way.
no, he's not.
uh, yes, he is.
not while your grandpa has 36, 000 armed men at his disposal, he's not.
that's right.
I like your hair; I think it looks nice.
thank you.
glad somebody noticed.
Henry, your turn.
the day I put my future in the hands of a cookie is the day they're singing "Danny Boy" for me.
Oh, you're a party pooper.
buzz kill.
I'll go. You already went! Twice!
guys, come on.
here, you can read me mine.
you are wise beyond your years.
that's very fitting, Jamie.
for the wise man who left Harvard crimson for NYPD blues.
better check the expiration date on that one.
Oh, very funny. Still the best decision I ever made.
Amen. What do you got, Dad?
you will take a chance.
and it will bite you on the tush.
you have been grumpy all night.
what gives?
I plead the Fifth, Counselor.
pop's upset because I'm considering bumping Jimmy Burke up to deputy chief.
he hit it out of the park today at Compstat, by the way, Pop.
does that mean you're giving him the bump?
I still don't get it, Grandpa.
look, what Jimmy Burke did for your father cannot be repaid.
but what he did to his own wife cannot be forgiven.
Jimmy Burke was a cheater?
15 years and three children, he hooks up with some chippy from the bar.
now, it tore the family apart.
call me old-fashioned, but, uh, don't ask me to trust the man if his own family won't.
I don't know, Grandpa, a lot of guys in the 15th would run through a brick wall for Jimmy Burke.
they think he's a stand-up guy.
then you know a lot of guys with their heads up their asses.
and you since when are you okay when a guy cheats on his wife?
I didn't say I was okay with a guy who cheats on his wife.
I said it doesn't necessarily make the guy a bad cop.
Oh. Well, now that we've got our priorities straight.
saved by the cell.
uh, I'm gonna take this it's for my case.
is this a bad time?
is this Sabrina?
Oh, I like the way you say my name.
what is it?
you said to call if something comes up.
something's come up.
okay, you want to tell me about it?
that's for me to know and for you to find out.
all right. I'm on my way.
who was that?
who was that, Danny?
witness.
you mean, Sabrina?
you know what's funny?
of all the cases in New York, you happen to catch the one starring... Angelina Jolie.
it's my work, babe.
that's what I came out here to remind you of.
I'm just saying the man's no good.
give it a rest, Pop.
I got to go.
you want to talk?
no, I don't think that's a good idea, Frank.
you're my daughter, too you know that.
Thanks.
Jackie? Hey, Sabrina just called.
she said she's got something for me.
why don't you meet me at the club.
Yeah, can't. Uh, just got ahold of King's girlfriend, Benita.
I'm on my way to see her now.
all right. All right, well, double back.
we'll meet at the squad room in an hour; I'll see you there.
Yeah. Great.
Hey, Dad, you got a minute?
I haven't seen that look on your face since you brought home a "C" in science.
you remember everything.
it was the only "C" you ever got.
it's your mother's ring.
Yeah.
we called off the wedding.
she's off in London for six months.
it's not her fault, it's mine.
ever since I came on the job,
I haven't really been there for her in a real way, so...
sometimes the job is tougher at home than it is on the streets.
I just hope I haven't let the best thing that ever happened to me walk out the door.
you know...
when you decided to give up the law and become a cop
I was...
disappointed.
well, I,um...
I knew you weren't thrilled.
well... you knew how much your mom wanted to keep you out of the family business, and...
I felt that...
the least I could do was see that Mary's wish was honored.
but you didn't stop me.
it wasn't my decision to make.
and it wasn't your mom's.
it was yours.
for what it's worth...
there's not a day goes by
I'm not proud to have you on my force.
I'm sorry about you and Sydney.
I am.
but please...
keep trusting your gut.
it serves you well.
hello.
you rang?
Hey, get over here.
can't do that.
Oh, yeah.
too married, two kids, right?
that's right. We should talk.
I'm all yours.
let's go.
king and I drove up from North Carolina three years ago.
weren't even dating yet.
just really good friends with something in common.
both dying to move to New York.
okay, so, uh, when did King become your boyfriend?
somewhere around Maryland.
he pulled over by the side of the road, said he couldn't go any further till he told me his secret.
and then he kissed me.
it was one of those kisses, you know?
Yeah. Afraid I do.
from that moment on, we just never left each other's side.
I was the first one to get a job, working nights at the hospital.
we wanted our days together, so it was perfect when he got the job as the doorman.
perfect New York story, huh?
it was...
until it wasn't.
a couple of months ago, things started to change.
he started, uh, hitting the after-hours scene pretty hard, especially the underground poker rooms.
king was a gambler?
Yeah, just not a very good one.
in case I got you in hot water with Mrs. Detective Reagan.
what is this?
last best kept secret in New York.
my favorite Nolita boutique.
buy her something nice, all will be forgiven.
and you brought me down here just for this?
wow, you really are married, huh?
no foreplay, just right to it.
you're enjoying yourself, aren't you?
I'm just happy you're here.
I'm not here. I'm on duty.
so, what's up?
king's cell phone.
I found it in the back room this morning.
a lot of calls from the same number.
girlfriend? - Lemon.
who's Lemon?
he's British.
some kind of gangster or something.
he runs this really sceney, after-hours casino.
king goes there a lot?
he swore it was just for fun.
a way to blow off steam after working the door all night.
I had no idea how bad it was till I read his e-mails last night.
he owed Lemon over $100, 000.
that's a lot of steam.
you think Lemon could have killed him?
I don't know, but he had 100, 000 reasons.
don't worry.
if-if he did this, we'll nail him.
it's-it's not that.
it's just, uh...
I can't believe King did this to us.
you're pregnant?
eight weeks.
I'm sorry.
okay, so where do I find this Lemon, just in case I want to give him a squeeze?
I'll tell you if you dance with me.
I can't do that.
alphabet City, corner of Sixth.
great. Thank you.
and I don't think you're the kind of guy who likes to take charity.
I'm not dancing with you.
this is not happening.
Oh, come on, Danny.
you remember what it's like out here where all the fun is.
it depends what you consider fun.
come on, I don't bite.
it's not your bite that I'm worried about.
it's your hips.
look, Ma. No hips.
excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
what's up, Jackie?
I don't know. You tell me.
you chasing the case, or you chasing that skirt?
come on. When have I never not kept my eyes on a case?
I'm just saying, if your wife saw your eyes on that one...
if my wife saw me, yeah,
I'd probably be dancing on crutches.
exactly. But I did get an address of a new suspect.
Oh. Do you want to go knock a door down?
Yes, please. Let's go.
show me your hands! Get your hands up!
show me those hands! Let's go!
leave the money on the tables!
keep your hands where we can see 'em.
out of the way!
there he is.
you must be Lemon. Delighted to meet you.
delighted to meet you, too, mate.
Yes, he owed me money.
no, I didn't kill him.
sit down.
100k. It's a lot more than just money.
can't be good for you, Lemon having that kind of paper out on the street.
muscle and murder are pass.
I'm into synergy.
hmm. Synergy?
so you're kind of like more the Gordon Gekko type than the John Gotti type.
the millennium's a decade old, Detective.
the future's in coming together, not breaking apart.
and how exactly did you and King come together?
Mm. I forgave him his, uh, considerable debt, and he accepted my offer to join me in an exciting new business venture.
an offer he couldn't refuse?
good to see blackmail's still in vogue.
some tools of the trade are timeless. Yeah.
now tell me about this new business venture.
we were opening a new nightclub.
you and King? Mm-hmm.
Yes, I bring the money, he brings the crowd.
we would have owned this city in a week.
so, King was leaving Sabrina?
scoop of the century, I know.
he was breaking it to her the night he was shot.
I gather it, uh... it didn't go over too well.
Yeah. No synergy there.
and I'm out a hundred Gs.
from the Kelly case last year?
Oh, Mrs. Griffin, yes.
I am sorry to bother you.
it's just... there's something going on, and
I knew you were the only one I could talk to.
it's about the police department.
now, I know your father is the one for...
okay, if you have a complaint about the police department, you really have to...
no, please. I don't want to cause any trouble.
I come from a police family.
I know how hard their jobs are.
it's...
just...
something's not right about this.
okay. What is it?
my granddaughter.
she was mugged a few months ago in the stairwell of our building.
Hey, Dad.
Hey.
Linda and I are fine, Dad.
are you're getting better at this, or am I getting worse?
no. You know what it is.
your voice it goes up in pitch when you're worried about one of your kids.
is that right?
well, put your old man out of his misery and tell me I've got nothing to worry about.
you got nothing to worry about, Dad.
talk to you later.
so, is it true that King told you him and Lemon were opening a club right down the street only hours before he got killed?
she's not going to answer that.
do not answer that. - Yes.
it's fine. Danny and I are friends.
that's quite a big piece of the puzzle you left out.
I'm not stupid. I knew how it would make me look.
it looks worse now.
all right, Danny, please.
I mean, seriously, do I look like someone who goes around killing people?
Hey, King moves to the new rope right down the block.
you and I both know, all your customers are going with him.
you're a tough girl.
you're not gonna just sit around and let that happen.
that's nonsense.
Really? That's motive, Sabrina.
okay. Yes, I was pissed off when I found out he was leaving.
and why shouldn't I be?
he was nothing before I put him on that door.
that's my stage, I made him a star, and I'm supposed to be happy when he leaves and takes everything I built with him?
exactly how unhappy were you?
this interview is officially over.
I wouldn't go too far, okay?
that enhanced video comes back, and you don't make a cameo, you're gonna be seeing a lot of us.
you know how to reach me.
Hey. - Hi.
you bring dinner? I did.
Ah, roast beef.
nice.
all right, let's go eat.
okay. Come on.
Hey, Jackie.
no.
not at all.
I know you'll do us proud at Manhattan South, Inspector.
and once again, congratulations.
knock, knock.
I was just heating up some Mother Kelly's.
you interested? Uh-uh.
we need to talk.
what about?
so she's a suspect now?
Yeah.
any chance I can get on the jury?
I'll see what I can do.
in the meantime, I know I don't always get to do special things for you, but... today I did.
look at that.
what do you think?
purple, your favorite color, match your sweater.
look at that. Oh.
what?
in 15 years of marriage, you ever see me wear something like this?
what's wrong with it? It's nice.
it's a new style.
it's gonna look great on you.
new style?
you been reading Vogue lately, have you, Danny Reagan?
look, I'm a big girl.
I know sometimes a man's eyes wander.
and if your mind wanders, too, a little, then... so be it.
just don't ever make me feel this small again.
her granddaughter was mugged in the stairwell, but when the officers from the 15th took her complaint, they classified the attack as harassment.
bet it felt like more than harassment to Mrs. Griffin's granddaughter.
so, three weeks later, a friend in the neighborhood is burglarized.
this time, they classify the burglary as trespassing.
Jimmy's cooking the books.
Yeah, but why?
he turns a felony into a misdemeanor, it looks like violent crime's dropping.
his stats go down, his stock goes up.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I heard you when I came in.
you already gave Burke the promotion, didn't you?
I wasn't talking to Burke.
I gave Gibson the Manhattan South Command.
you already passed over Burke? Why?
trust your gut.
it's a funny thing about decisions.
you don't seem to need to have to talk yourself into the right ones.
good for you, Dad.
Yeah.
only now I got to say good-bye to an old friend.
Hey. Think fast. Oh.
Oh, I could have told you that wasn't gonna work.
yeah? So why didn't you?
cause you had it coming.
and I also knew that the store didn't take returns.
well, it looks good on you.
you keep it. Oh, really?
TARU finally uploaded the video enhancement on your nightclub surveillance video.
beautiful. -Thank you.
look at this. We got a wider picture.
look at that, there's Sabrina.
look who was telling the truth.
let's watch it again.
you see that?
Yeah. That was a flash.
what was it? A reflection of the shot?
maybe.
that's not a reflection. That's a spark.
our bullet hit a streetlamp.
a ricochet?
exactly.
so that means that King wasn't the target.
then who was?
the only other person who was there.
listen. The bullet that killed King ricocheted off a streetlight outside the club.
he wasn't the intended target.
all right, well, then who?
you.
Yeah, no. That's ridiculous.
who in the world would want to kill me?
something tells me the list might be a little longer than you think.
listen, we're gonna need the names of anybody you're romantically involved with.
uh, yeah, you and my mother.
Hey. Whoever tried to kill you is still out there.
you want to give them a second chance?
be my guest. And you think the list is so long I need a pad?
we're running out of time here, okay?
you know, I don't think I like the way you say my name anymore.
fine. Then who?
there was only one.
fine. Let's get this person on the phone.
give him a call. Can't.
why not?
because he was shot the other night.
of course. King?
Oh, my God.
did Benita know?
well, I certainly didn't tell her.
right. She's two months pregnant. Did you know that?
you even care about that?
probably not. Easy, Jack.
Yeah, I'm gonna wait outside.
that was your wife I saw the other day, wasn't it?
Yeah. Why?
let me ask you something.
what has she got that I don't have?
me.
I'm sure you know by now.
NYPD's got more gossips than a beauty parlor.
Gibson's the right man for the job, and he deserves it.
well, I appreciate you giving it to me straight.
you've been cooking the books, Jimmy.
now...
you give it to me straight.
I've given 40 years of my life to this job.
you know what I got to show for it?
three bullet holes, two destroyed marriages and not a decent night's sleep in a decade.
I'm not some tomato in the bar, getting weak in the knees from your war stories, Jimmy.
for what it's worth, it's only the past six months.
I was gonna get my bump and then pull the plug.
you meant well, otherwise you wouldn't have done it.
I've heard it, Jimmy.
my whole life as a cop, I've heard it.
come on, Frank.
I'm carrying two alimonies and four college tuitions.
going out a two star was my only shot at not spending my golden years hanging sheet rock.
if you no longer had the commitment, you should have put in your papers.
all we've got out there is our word, Jimmy.
we lose that, we got nothing.
we lose that, we are nothing.
everything we've been through...
you gonna bust me down?
to Captain.
and I'm reassigning you to the 1-2-5.
Staten Island.
or you can pull the plug right now, and leave with your pension and your dignity intact.
Thanks, Frank.
everything we've been through...
now, if you'll excuse me, I got some police work to do.
heading back to North Carolina?
another five minutes, and I'm done here.
I don't suppose you'd be willing to take a little walk?
afraid that's not possible.
when did you learn they were sleeping together, Benita?
that night.
I went on the computer to send him our first sonogram, and he left his e-mail page open.
Where'd you get the gun?
he gave it to me a year ago.
to keep me safe.
ironic, huh?
Yeah.
just keep walking.
officer Gonsalves?
you were on the warrant squad with my brother that night.
I said "walk."
you said to meet on the next corner.
I lied.
better tell your brother Danny you need a refresher on picking up tails, Reagan.
I've been on you for three blocks.
where are we going? Just move.
how did you find me?
who are you working for? And what do you want?
even think about lying, and I'm a faint memory.
I got your number from the Pension Section.
follow the money. Not bad, rook.
I'm not working for anyone.
I want to know what happened to my brother Joe.
read the official report.
I did. It's a snow job.
okay.
so maybe you've got a little Reagan blood in you, after all.
why did you leave the department?
I loved being on the job, but my daughter needs a mother, not a dead cop.
did somebody threaten you?
was it Blue Templar?
is that who killed Joe?
so, how we doing?
you tell me.
I never stepped out of bounds, Linda.
I ain't that guy.
I know.
do you?
of course.
just...
I know Danny Reagan from when we first met.
running around this city, all hours of the night, more girlfriends than I had shoes.
Yeah, but when we got our thing going,
I never looked back, did I?
no.
but sometimes I wonder.
maybe you miss it.
I mean...
sure is more exciting than sleepy Staten Island with me and the boys.
says who?
you mean that?
Yeah, I do.
I love you.
Jack! - Yeah.
Sean! - Coming.
time to go. Come on. - Coming, Dad.
coming. - All right.
Where's my left attack? - Right here.
all right. And my right attack?
here. - That's what I'm talking about.
you guys get your helmets and get your stuff ready, and Mom will take you to practice.
got it.
maid's off today, Danny.
hmm?
dishwasher.
and your fork.
something wrong?
something's got to be wrong 'cause I don't want to be your personal servant?
well, I don't know. You've just been giving me the stink eye since I rolled out of bed.
Yeah, at noon.
is that what this is about?
hello. I worked a midnight tour.
which is why I asked you mow the lawn and take care of the leaves yesterday.
I didn't mow the lawn.
I'll get it. Get out of here. I'll get it.
been a real pleasure.
there's a suggestion box around the corner, Detective.
I don't know how you can stand it around here.
well, it's the little things.
you know, the deluxe accommodations, first-class travel.
right. - What's going on?
well, one of your lackeys tossed my case.
that was my call.
your call? - Yeah, you have one witness who's got a rap sheet longer than the perp's.
well, I'm sorry His Eminence the Archbishop didn't just happen to be standing in an alley on 125th Street the night my victim was mugged.
Danny, we cannot spend money on cases we know we're not going to win.
you think you can't win.
you don't know you can't win. - No, I do.
which is why they went to the trouble of painting my name on the door.
if you guys aren't going to prosecute these people, we might as well just shoot them in the street!
what's this?
Oh, you don't want this stuff?
you know, I thought it had some sentimental value to you, and that's why you left it in the car that I'm driving today.
I thought Rubino grabbed them.
Oh, did you think Rubino filled the gas tank, too?
you know, what happens if my partner and I are chasing down some mutt and he squirts because the tank is empty?
I'll fill it up now.
no, you'll fill it up at the end of your tour the way you're supposed to.
the same way every other detective around here does. You got it?
everything okay, Reagan?
everything's fine, Sarge-- just peachy keen.
Kelsey and I are just going over ways to make things more efficient around here, right?
right.
come on, Reagan. We just caught our first tour.
at least we'll have a clean car.
enjoy your tour.
Yeah, it's going to be a good one.
tell us what happened. - What happened?
tell us what happened. - He tried to kill me!
it was a cantaloupe. She threw it at me first. - You have to arrest him.
hold on. Hold on. The weapon was a cantaloupe?
Yeah, down from that window. Nearly hit me in the head.
could've given me a concussion.
Oh, and you decided to throw it back up?
Yeah, and he smashed the window. Gls was flying everywhere.
look!
all right, here's what we're going to do.
we're going to go find someone who's an actual criminal-- maybe someone with a honeydew.
okay? Good night.
Hey! This was attempted murder.
and that is assault on a police officer.
how would you like it if I arrest you, ma'am?
Hey. Why don't you do your job? Huh?
what are we paying you for? - You're paying me to deal with fruitcakes like you.
Oh, really? You hear him? - Fruitcakes with fruit.
are you going to let him talk to me this way?
enough. Shut up!
be a man! - I'm going to arrest you, okay?
reagan, let's go.
she wants me to earn my pay, I'm going to earn it right now.
reagan, I'm getting in the car!
you'll spend the night in jail. - No. Come on.
Yeah, you are. - Police! Help me!
I'm going to arrest... - Reagan!
step aside. Step aside.
where you going?
there's a guy chasing me. He's got a gun.
move away! Get back.
Hey! Drop the weapon!
police! I said drop your weapon!
drop it! - Police! Drop your weapon!
Yeah, Central. Shots fired. We have one perp down.
we have a 10-85.
he's still breathing. Get a bus.
need an ambulance at the corner of 18th and McDonald.
he's a cop.
we have a 10-13.
we have an officer down.
I'm on my way.
how bad?
Hey! You hang on! You hear me?
I am not going to lose you!
Jackie! - I'm going as fast as I can.
go faster!
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You keep your eyes open.
do not close your eyes on me, damn it. Listen to me.
listen, he's a cop. He's a cop. His name is Lou Tedesco.
who's a doctor here? - I am.
he's got two rounds to the chest. Nine-millimeter, about 12 minutes ago.
you hear me? Come on!
we got him, Detective. - Let go. Hurry up.
let go, Detective! - Wait!
we got him. - Help him. Help him.
come on. Come on.
here you go.
any news?
nurse came by. He's still in surgery.
they had to remove part of his lung, Jack.
he's got internal bleeding and a concussion from falling down the steps.
that's Tedesco's wife. Heard her talking to the doctor.
look at me. Danny.
it was a good shoot.
there's nothing good about this, Jackie.
he did not identify himself as a police officer.
you did what you were supposed to do.
we did what we were trained to do.
you didn't fire.
cause the cantaloupe people were in my way.
but you know what? If they weren't, I'd be in the exact same boat as you.
don't do this to yourself.
detectives Reagan, Curatola?
captain Derek Elwood.
I'll be the shooting team leader on this. Are you two holding up?
fine, sir.
Yeah.
as you know, Detective Reagan, I'm going to need to ask you some questions.
but before I do, I need to advise you that you're entitled to have your union representative and your counsel present.
do you wish to do so?
no. - Danny.
it's all right. I got nothing to hide.
right this way.
we identified ourselves and...
we yelled out for him to stop three or four times. He just kept coming.
was it, uh... was it three or four times...that you told him to stop?
I don't know.
and you're certain that he, uh, never identified himself as a police officer?
Yeah.
how sure?
he never said he was a cop.
did he say anything?
I don't think so.
you don't think so?
it was loud.
there was a train coming in overhead. It was noisy.
I don't think so. - Okay.
why don't you go back to your squad, Detective, fill out your firearms discharge report, and we'll be in touch.
officer Tedesco's still in surgery.
I'm afraid he's critical, Frank.
his wife and son are here, and we're doing everything we can to make them comfortable.
I'd like a moment with her when she's up to it.
of course. - I read Tedesco's file. He's a good cop.
Danny's okay.
as you were.
do we know why Officer Tedesco was in pursuit?
no. He was off duty.
we're checking, but it doesn't appear that he made any 911 calls.
we do know that he lives in the vicinity.
possibly he came upon a crime in progress.
let's know, not guess. What about the male white he was chasing?
nothing yet, sir.
we need to find him, Ed.
commissioner. Commissioner! Is it true this was a friendly fire incident?
uh, we're still in the information gathering phase of this investigation, so we won't be discussing details till we have all the facts.
a blogger is reporting that your son was the detective who fired the shots, Commissioner.
can you confirm that?
okay, people, how many times... - We have an officer down.
as much as we'd appreciate your understanding and compassion in this delicate circumstance,
I realize that is an unrealistic hope.
okay, Jane, Matt, you know what?
why don't you come this way? Let me share what details I can offer.
what are you doing here? - Of course I'm here.
who's with the kids?
Erin and Nicky. They're fine. They're sound asleep.
how are you? - I'm all right.
I'm all right. - I'm not so sure about that.
I'm fine. It's fine, and everything's gonna be fine. Okay?
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, me, too.
how many times do you have to hear... - We have an officer down.
as much as we we'd appreciate your understanding and compassion in this delicate circumstance, I realize that is an unrealistic hope.
and while the commissioner will not give details on the shooting, there is one eyewitness, Ms. Angela Jackson, and she described Detective Reagan as being angry and agitated immediately before the incident.
Angela, can you please tell us what happened?
Yeah. He was out of control. He was screaming at me for no reason.
and then, he was even screaming at his partner.
and then, the next thing I know, he turns around, and he shoots the guy.
I'm-I'm telling you, he was out of control.
it appears this witness, Angela Jackson, has an axe to grind with Detective Reagan.
be nice if one of the hundred reporters she gave her exclusive to did some actual reporting and dug that up.
well, other witnesses on the street also described Detective Reagan as... being agitated.
people who don't have an axe to grind with Detective Reagan?
Yes. But this investigation is far from complete.
I mean, there-there's precedence for waiting to hear...
we're not going to look for reasons not to go by the book here.
is that clear? - Yes, sir.
you will conduct a complete, thorough and impartial investigation. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
you know, you're the worst client I've ever had.
thank you.
you pop off at the hospital. The press is salivating, Frank.
when do they not?
I'm just saying, it wouldn't hurt if you told the media what you just told Captain Elwood.
wouldn't hurt you. Might kill me.
here we go. - Here we go, what, Garrett?
here you go, making our jobs ten times more difficult than they have to be.
you're making the right call.
the press would lap it up. Just let 'em.
no, I will not just let them.
why the hell not?
because I don't like pandering on my best day.
he's my son... Garrett.
they don't teach this stuff at the academy.
you could recuse yourself.
you're gonna have to do something, Frank.
I have a credible report that a member of my department was, quote,"out of control" just before he shot a fellow officer.
I know damn well what I have to do.
Hey. - Yeah.
TARU loaded up the surveillance video from the subway platform.
Oh. Anything? - Oh, yeah. Come on.
take a look.
Oh, what do you know? That's our guy.
Oh, yeah. We're distributing a screen-grab of this kid's mug citywide.
we find him, we find out what Tedesco was doing.
there's no train in the station.
no. They probably came up from the street.
ran up one staircase and down the other one.
Yeah. There's Tedesco.
you all right? - Yeah.
look, you see that?
Yeah.
look.
gun. Was he strapped?
not when we saw him.
watch. Look.
ESU's looking for it as we speak.
let's go help them.
come on, Sarge. We just got our first break.
can it wait? - No, it can't wait.
okay.
what is it?
you're being put on modified assignment.
what?
word just came down from the commissioner's office.
so, I'm a house mouse.- Mm-hmm.
you can't leave that desk.
and you know what else.
I'll keep 'em warm for you, Detective.
you did what you had to do.
you got nothing to feel guilty about.
what makes you think I feel guilty?
cause you got a hero in that bag from Ziggy's with my name on it.
no shield, and still one of my best detectives.
how's Tedesco?
he's still unconscious.
how are you?
we can't really talk about it, can we?
no, we can't.
you ever wonder why I never ask you to go fishing?
you got the attention span of a gnat.
remember that summer Uncle Jim offered me a job as a telemarketer in Jersey?
I am still amazed you were able to resist the allure of hustling aluminum siding.
Yeah, that took guts.
that was the same summer you told me you were going to take the cop test.
remember what I said?
never buy aluminum siding from a company with no fixed address"?
the other thing I said.
new York's Finest just got a little better.
that's as true today as it was then.
I don't know, Dad.
I do.
so would you say Detective Reagan was feeling angry?
no, I would not say that.
I have no earthly idea how he was feeling.
Erin, we're not arguing in front of a jury. There's no need for you to view me as the enemy.
really, Derek?
well, it's nice to know that this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
don't forget that I am usually the one asking the questions.
okay, let's go to it then.
did Detective Reagan say anything to make you question his performance as a New York City police detective?
absolutely not.
are you sure he never said, uh...
if you guys won't prosecute 'em, maybe we should just shoot 'em in the street"?
come on. He was frustrated.
we had just tossed his case. He was just blowing off steam.
Oh, so you could tell he was feeling angry?
just leave it right there, okay? Thanks.
you're doing more on modified than most of my guys do full duty.
well, Sarge, Tedesco wasn't chasing that guy for nothing.
been fishing through these Sprint reports looking for any whiff of activity within a half mile of the incident.
And?
so far, I got an anonymous 911 caller, reported a woman screaming ten blocks from the El where Tedesco ran into us, 18 minutes earlier.
responding officer reported nobody was there.
he closed it out, 10-90X.
okay, well, why was nobody there, Sarge?
I mean, somebody was screaming, right? What, did she disappear?
don't you remember patrol, Reagan? We used to get ten of these a tour.
probably some lady screaming because she saw a spider in the sink.
lab came back on the gun your guy tossed. No prints of value.
great. - But... there was blood on it.
they're running it now along with ballistics.
that's beautiful.
you hear that, Jack? We got...
look, this woman was giving us a hard time. Danny gave her a hard time right back.
that's how it goes on the job. You know that.
but what doesn't happen every day-- two partners getting into it in the middle of the street.
Danny and I have a... a unique... dynamic.
if what you're telling me is that you and your partner routinely scream at each other, maybe it's time one of you get reassigned.
that's not what I'm saying.
then say what you're saying.
I think the issue here is whether or not Officer Tedesco identified himself as a police offer.
and I am telling you he did not.
how can you be sure?
because I was there.
Yeah, you were there.
you were screaming at Detective Reagan, and he was screaming at you and Mrs. Jackson, and all this is going on while a...
a man is running down the stairs yelling that another man with a gun is trying to kill him?
I don't think it's a stretch that we consider the possibility that maybe, while all this was going on, maybe Officer Tedesco did identify himself.
and maybe, just maybe, Detective Reagan was not in the mood to listen.
captain, don't do this.
we're not through yet, Detective.
don't do this.
I'm doing my job.
did Detective Reagan do his?
we were at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Danny did the right thing.
Hey. You still here. Good. - Yeah.
Danny, this guy from I. A.I...
don't worry about him. Okay?
I'm not worried about him.
you want to worry about someone? Let's worry about Officer Tedesco, okay?
let's worry about finding the guy that he was chasing.
now a 911 caller said a woman was screaming at this address.
can you go find out why?
I don't know anything about that. I didn't hear anything.
well, a 911 caller said there were screams coming from your house.
maybe it was the TV.
are you sure, Mrs. Lee? This is really very important.
somebody made a mistake.
okay. Okay.
Oh. You know what? My phone went dead.
you know, I-I really need to call in to close this out.
do you mind if I use your phone?
I don't... - Please?
it'll just take a second-- my boss is gonna kill me if I don't finish this.
thank you.
it's right... - Yeah.
um, please hurry-- I'm late for an appointment.
Yeah, it'll just take one second.
Hey. - Yeah. It's me.
I'm in Ms. Lee's living room. Yeah, my-my cell died.
you running a game? - Okay, I'll hold.
so, what were you watching last night?
a movie, or one of those talk guys?
I don't remember.
well, if it was one of those talk guys, then there wouldn't be any screaming going on, unless there's some...
Oh, wow. That's a great photo.
who's in the photo with you?
uh, that's... my son.
is that also your son?
Danny, we're coming in. - Yeah, get her in, get her in.
he used to be a good boy.
he was gonna go to college.
he was gonna study hotel administration.
your son's not reading too good from where we're sitting, Mrs. Lee.
yesterday he did something that got a police officer shot, and that police officer's in critical condition now.
it's the drugs. He's not my Tyler anymore.
I don't know who he is.
so he was at your house last night.
so you were the one screaming.
when he runs out of money for drugs for him and his girlfriend, he comes to see me.
he takes money, whatever I have that he can sell.
it used to happen every now and then, and now...now it's all the time.
so your son came to rob you yesterday?
I told him I wasn't gonna give him another red cent.
and then he pulled out a gun.
on me. His own mother.
and that's why you screamed.
I ran out of the house. I... I told him to shoot me.
I begged him... to put me out of my misery.
then I looked in his eyes...and there was nothing there.
I think he was gonna do it. And then that man came over.
you mean this man?
go ahead, look at him.
I didn't know he was a police officer.
he must have seen us fighting.
he came over and told Tyler to get his hands off me, and Tyler ran.
and that man ran after him.
why didn't you call the police?
he's my son.
so... how was he when he left here yesterday?
he was normal.
normal.
we're hearing that he was unusually tense yesterday, and we're just wondering... when that started.
Danny is an intense guy. - Yeah.
he loves the job, and that's where he puts his energy-- plus me and the boys.
right. So yesterday there was nothing unusual.
well, he left his dish on the counter. That's plenty usual.
and then what happened?
then he went to work.
okay. I see.
well, thank you very much for your hospitality. It's much appreciated.
I'm just curious. How did that... vase get broken?
then he saw that vase.
I told him it was an accident, but I don't know, I think he got the wrong idea.
you did the right thing, Linda. Don't worry about it.
the right thing"" I don't even know what that is anymore.
you know? I'm sorry, but...
the years that you've given this department, the sacrifices that you've made, the...
the toll that it's taken on...on us and the kids, and this is the thanks we get.
being railroaded by some guy.
babe, he's I. A.okay? That's what they do.
it's not right.
someone could damn well tell him so.
someone?
would it be the end of the world if he stepped in?
it may not make a lot of sense, and it may hurt like hell to hear it, but yes...it would be the end of the world.
I know. I know.
it's gonna be all right.
Hey. - You're up.
well, I was going to leave a message, but...
what do you got?
well, the blood came back on Tyler Lee's gun, and it's Officer Tedesco's.
Tedesco? How could that be?
but wait, it gets better. Ballistics matches the gun to a liquor store holdup last week.
robber shot and killed the owner. Looks like our Tyler Lee is a murderer.
where are you? - Home.
Danny. - Look, don't freak out, all right?
I'm sitting on Mrs. Lee's house.
are you out of your mind?
I said, don't freak out.
well, it's too late, Danny.
Seriously? You're modified.
if they catch you out there, you're gonna be suspended or worse.
I know, I know, but I was thinking,
Tyler didn't get the money last time he came home, which means he's probably gonna come back.
and when he does, he's gonna find an old friend waiting for him.
no, he's not. You need to get out of there now.
Oh, come on, Jack, five more minutes. - Danny.
okay, fine. Listen, I'm starting my car.
you hear that? Okay, and now I'm driving away.
all right, I'll call you tomorrow.
put your hands where we can see them.
sir, step out the car.
look, it's okay, guys-- I'm on the job.
we got a call about a suspicious car in the neighborhood.
can we see your shield?
I don't have it.
Tom Julien from the two-nine called.
two of his people picked up Danny out on the street, and he was working the case.
What'd you tell Tom to do?
his job.
can you pass the corn, please?
do I have to eat this? - Yes.
grandpa? Are you gonna fire my dad? - Sean.
I'm sorry, Frank.
no, I'm not.
I think it's wrong to punish Danny for doing his job.
I mean, I get it-- Uncle Danny shouldn't have been out on the street, but...
his intentions were good.
cop to cop, Dad, I think Danny's earned a little leeway here.
Francis, in my day, we probably turned the other way too often when it came to one of our own.
but sometimes it was the right thing to do.
being held to the same standard as everyone else is one thing, but it does feel like Danny's being held to a higher one.
you're damn straight he is.
when I coached you in softball or you boys in hoops,
I always held you to a higher standard because you're capable of meeting it, and because you are...
I expect it.
Danny, I don't think there's a cop at this table
not your grandpa, not me, not Jamie-- who wouldn't have made the same decision you did in that split second.
but he worked the street without a shield.
and it can't matter why.
and it shouldn't matter that he's my son.
he's right.
dad's right.
orders are orders, and every cop ought to know it.
I was out of line.
I raised your father the way he raised all of you-- to know the difference between right and wrong.
never thought I'd be almost sorry I did.
what's bothering you?
nothing.
Hey. Don't think I still can't sweat a guy.
I made this robbery collar. Took this guy out with my asp-- he never saw it coming.
what's going on?
Renzulli wasn't too happy about it, because I didn't draw my weapon.
this perp was armed?
no. But, well, we thought he might have been. Turns out it was just his hand in his pocket.
well, then you're lucky you were riding with Renzulli and not me. I would've knocked your teeth in.
the guy wasn't armed.
why did you hesitate?
come on, Jamie. - What if I hesitated to draw for the wrong reason?
two cops, two Reagan cops, involved in a shooting in the same week?
you're thinking like a lawyer.
look, you're coming into your own, as a cop.
you're improvising, that's good.
but when you're out on the job, you can't be thinking about what your brother did or who your father is.
you do your job. Understand?
Yes, Grandpa.
like they used to tell us at the academy, better you should have to explain to the D. A.why you shot a guy than have someone have to explain to your family why you didn't.
grandpa's right, son.
better to be judged by 12 than carried by six.
we're most proud of you when you come home safe.
Hey, what's going on?
I picked up your stakeout where you left off.
seems like Tyler did go back to Mommy again.
you got him? - No.
he sent a messenger, his better half.
meet Lydia Pepper, Tyler's girlfriend.
how many times do you need to hear it? I don't know where Tyler is.
you do know where he is, - because he sent you to his mother's house to go pick up clothes. - No. No.
this boyfriend of yours, he must be some charmer, huh?
he pulls a gun on his own mother, and then he sends his little girlfriend in to fight his own battles
and you're still sitting here protecting him?
look, I told you, he keeps moving around. When he wants me, he finds me.
come on, Lydia.
we can tell you been getting high so long that you're numb to the outside world.
but I also think that deep down there's still someone who knows what it means to do the right thing.
there is a police officer on life support right now because of what Tyler did.
his name is Lou Tedesco.
he's got a wife and a little boy and a baby on the way.
Hey. Look at his picture. Look at the picture. Look at the picture!
there's no running away from this one, you understand me?
you could smoke every rock in this city, but you will not get this one off of your conscience.
it's all her fault.
what?
if she just did what Tyler said, none of this would've happened.
wait a minute, who are we talking about here, Lydia?
Tyler's mother, Mrs. Lee.
why didn't she just give us the money?
so you were there. - Across the street.
what happened?
she and Tyler were on the stoop yelling at each other.
she wouldn't give him anything, and Tyler was losing it.
he starts grabbing her, and suddenly this guy steps in and tries to break it up.
this guy, Officer Tedesco?
he grabs Tyler and tries to put him up against the wall
that's when Mrs. Lee grabbed Tyler's gun and whacked him over the head.
and Tyler and the guy took off running. - Wait a minute.
Mrs. Lee grabbed a gun and...and-and whacked Officer Tedesco in the head?
Yeah.
hard?
when he ran off, he was stumbling like he was drunk.
I'm gonna go make a call.
detective Reagan's mental state at the time of the shooting appears to have been a negative factor in his decision making.
but I have received some new information this morning that will shed light on the circumstances of the shooting.
please enlighten us.
officer Tedesco was struck in the head with the suspect's gun at the start of the incident.
now, that would account for the head trauma that had been attributed to his fall down the stairs after he was shot.
he received that blow before the foot chase?
well, his doctors are surprised he was able to walk, let alone identify himself as a police officer-- which supports Detective Reagan's testimony.
and does any of that excuse Detective Reagan's violation of his modified status?
all due respect, sir, that's not my call.
no, Captain. It's mine.
we had a team on Tyler Lee's girlfriend all night. He never showed.
now Curatola's tailing her, thinking she may be headed for a meet.
she could use some backup.
why are you telling me, Sarge?
can't you see I'm busy sharpening pencils?
Oh. Did I forget to mention? You've been restored to full duty.
Congratulations.
heard you need a little backup.
Oh. Look who got out of the penalty box again.
Yep. Except now, it's official.
I kind of liked you in the office, you know.
Oh, you like my coffee, huh? - Yes, exactly.
it's always nice and hot.
you think she made us?
no. No sense taking any chances, though. Gonna give her a little space.
what, is she texting again?
you think she's trying to get in contact with Tyler?
Yeah, the first ten times I thought so, but now I just think she's got more friends than me.
there he is.
grab her. I'm on him. - Yeah.
Hey! - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
get out of the way!
hold on!
move!
Hey!
come here!
come here, come here!
you still looking for the police, dirtbag? Huh?
guess what? I'm right here.
so, the doctors said they had never seen a patient fight their way back the way you did.
and I said,"What do you expect? He comes out of the six-five.
your old house.
I see they taught you the job the same way they taught me.
no retreat, no surrender.
get well.
get back on the street; do us proud.
Yes, sir.
I see you have another visitor.
good thing I'm not a great shot.
look at this--gun collar, two weapons possessions, two outstanding warrants.
you know, we gotta take these transit assignments more often, Jack.
Yeah, well, maybe they'll think twice before they jump the turnstile with a pistol in their pocket.
that's right, Einstein.
try to save yourself two bucks, you get two years instead.
the NYPD crackdown on subway fare-beaters has once again yielded numerous arrests on more serious charges.
but not everyone is singing the praises of Commissioner Reagan's popular program.
I'm here with the Reverend Darnell Potter of the Disciples of Isaiah Church.
Reverend, this program has gotten dozens of guns off the street.
isn't that hard to argue with?
not if the ends don't justify the means, Jane.
I mean, this program is oppressive. It is offensive.
yet another example of Commissioner Reagan's extreme tactics, and one that I don't see him practicing in the white neighborhoods.
what exactly are you saying?
I'd give my right arm to stick my left foot in your mouth, pal.
I'm afraid that would be considered excessive force, Pop.
fine, then I'll use a sock instead.
what's he saying about me this morning?
that you're an oppressor and a racist.
that's all? He's dogging it.
it's not funny, Francis.
the buck has got to stop somewhere, and this time, it's on Frank Reagan's desk.
this guy's dangerous.
only if you're standing between him and a television camera.
do you think we're gonna see this kind of chain-gang parade in SoHo?
Hm? No.
I swear, Reagan, sometimes I'm convinced that God himself is a member of the Fraternal Order of Police.
yeah? Why's that?
cause every once in a while he lets a clown like this blow a red light when I'm right behind him.
it's your lucky day, Sarge. - Yeah, I guess so.
license and registration.
I don't care, I want it on my desk in ten minutes!
if you don't have Stadler's numbers on it, I don't care.
I don't care, either. Take your time. He's gonna be a while, all right?
license and registration.
12 George. 10-30. Male with a gun at 122 Lenox.
12 Sergeant op. Copy that. Show us responding, okay?
what do you know -- it turns out it's your lucky day, GQ.
we got a call about a robbery in progress.
all police inquiries to greet through Reverend Potter's office.
show us your hands, please.
that's a sanctuary up there.
yeah? Not for a man with a gun. Now, step aside.
there's no firearm permitted inside.
that's exactly the way we feel. Step aside. Now.
back up, I said. - Back up.
we have two officers approaching now.
over here.
all right, that's far enough. Right there.
you were told this is a house of worship.
step aside right now. - Man, you're not getting in.
we're not screwing around anymore. Now, make a hole.
get your hands off him!
Sarge... Sarge, you okay?
you all right? Sarge...
Hey, back up! Back up! Stay back!
10-85, forthwith!
uh, 122 Lenox. I need a bus.
what's going on? - Officers in distress, a few blocks away.
all right, take them. Jack, we gotta go. Take them.
watch out! - Excuse me.
move aside! Step back!
let go! I got you, Sarge. This way.
what the hell's going on? Back up! Hey, kid!
Danny... - What happened?
he's hurt. A bus is on the way.
Hey! I said back up! - This is a church! Hey!
come here... come here... What are you doing, huh?
put your hands on a police officer, huh?
better watch your back, pig! - Hey! Back it up!
10-13. We need more units. We got a situation here.
I said back up!
how's he doing? - He'll live.
Yeah, he caught a lot worse than that in fifth grade, - banging around for the basketball under the basket. - Intentional foul.
eh, it was fair and square, kid; I'm just going for the ball.
how's the sergeant? - They don't know yet. How are you?
I'm fine. It's not as bad as it looks.
the guy that pushed you down the stairs-- you see him over there?
no. No, they must still be in the building. Hey, J.
you get a good look at him?
Yeah, it was a big guy, uh, with an earring, and a skinny guy.
caught him with a backhand when I was going down.
well, the guy you collared in the car may know who they are.
we better get them out of here, though, before they launch a rescue.
Yeah, all right. - You all right?
Yeah.
are you sure you're all right?
Yeah.
I just feel stupid walking into something like that, you know?
there was supposed to be a robbery, but I don't know.
whoa, hey, somebody says there's a guy with a gun, you go in. - Yeah, I know.
kid, I know I bust your chops about Harvard and all that stuff, but listen to me-- what you did today was true blue.
I understand. - I'll see you later.
all right.
sergeant Renzulli sustained a concussion.
officer Reagan just some minor cuts and bruises, so far as we know.
is the scene secure? - In process.
it's a commercial building, but Reverend Potter's church rents an old theatre on the second floor for their sanctuary.
...Police officers and members of the church.
now, details are sketchy, but apparently the fight broke out when the police officers were denied entry in the building...
it's on the sensitive locations list.
communications should have relayed that to the responding officers.
and look, I know the guy that runs this place is a thorn in your side...
you give him too much credit-- He's just a camera hog.
but the church does a lot of good.
Yeah, they tossed some drug dealers out of the neighborhood.
well, now they've tossed two police officers down a flight of stairs.
please don't tell me we're heading out there.
what, and make his day? Not if I can help it.
the police don't know what to do, because the church members will not budge.
thank you.
well, if it isn't Larry Skolnick.
you missed me. I'm touched.
so, how's private practice treating you? - Good.
heard you had a big tax evasion case-- lot of press.
Ka-ching, ka-ching. It paid for the new condo.
45th floor, river view. You should come check it out.
yeah... uh, heights make me dizzy.
Oh, even better.
there's a great little Italian place on the ground floor. You'd love it.
thank you, Larry, but...
we could talk about opportunities for you.
people in my firm would jump to have you.
Yeah, I don't think I'm quite ready to cross over to the dark side.
what, you really enjoy butting heads with scuzzball drug dealers?
you think I'm going to enjoy defending them?
which reminds me-- my 11: 00 a. m.
scuzzball should be here any moment.
actually... He's early.
Larry Skolnick, counsel for the scuzzball.
commissioner, sir...
as you were.
I'm sorry, Commissioner, but the situation's gone from bad to worse.
don't apologize, Ed. I know that was the last phone call you wanted to make.
it's a standoff.
they're over there, we're over here. No communication whatsoever.
and the peanut gallery's getting larger by the minute.
all the exits secured? - Yes, 10 minutes ago.
E.S.U? - Captain?
James? - Sir.
we can take the building any time. Simultaneous tactical entry at five points.
we can have this over before lunch.
this crowd's going to love that.
there's Potter.
you should talk to him.
I'm right here.
Lucinda, I'm glad you and your colleagues are here to witness this.
a church that has rid the community of drugs, has run job training programs to help the people.
and what do we get?
a sea of blue surrounding a house of worship.
but there are unconfirmed reports, Reverend, that church security guards assaulted two police officers answering a 911 call.
you don't think a police response was warranted?
I have a question for you:
do you think we'd get this same response if these unconfirmed reports happened in St. Patrick's Cathedral?
hell, no! - Hell no is right!
and there'll be no negotiation until the police remove their army of occupation.
captain, get your men ready.
can I get an amen on that? - Amen!
we ain't going anywhere here.
we'll stay right here. Right here!
how you feeling, Sarge?
like I fell down a flight of stairs on my noggin.
that's funny 'cause that's exactly what you did.
well, what do you know?
doc says you got a concussion. You got to rest up a couple more days.
Yeah.
Hey, do me a favor.
would you check the drawer? Make sure my watch is still there.
my old man gave it to me when I went on the job.
said after the gun, a cop's best friend is knowing what time it is.
smart guy, your old man. - Yeah, he was.
he would have liked you, Reagan.
he would have thought you was a good influence on me.
close call out there today, Sarge.
could have went either way, but it went ours.
never look back, though, right? That's what you taught me?
that's right, kid.
and I wish I would have met your old man so I could have set him straight about one thing.
it's you who's a good influence on me.
and you don't forget it.
all right.
the guy with the earring-- what was his name?
and the skinny guy was, uh, Clarence Thomas? - You mock us?
Hey, you started with the jokes, friend.
not to mention assaulting a police officer.
someone pushed me from behind.
I tripped into you. - Right.
this whole thing was a police provocation.
Oh, right, so those two officers, they just pushed themselves down the stairs. Is that right?
they burst into a place of worship.
with weapons. For no reason.
except there was a report of an armed robbery.
what robbery? We were praying. It's a church.
right, it's a church and you were praying.
then why did two officers just burst in for no reason?
there are elements in the police, huh? Racists, provocateurs.
let's get one thing straight.
those cops weren't racists and they weren't provocateurs.
so they were manipulated and lied to.
there was no armed robbery.
guy sees the world through a very special set of blinders.
Yeah, I'm beginning to think there was no armed robbery at all.
Yeah, but somebody called up and said there was one.
so let's pull the 911 tape, see if we can't figure out who it was.
we shall not be moved! - No!
we must witness!
stand tall, stand tall!
we're gonna stand right here, y'all.
with minimum force, Captain. - Understood.
once you're inside, take special care with any religious objects.
wasn't a Bible that threw two men down the stairs.
Yes, sir.
the mayor's here.
how are you doing? - Yes, I'm doing good, sir, I'm doing good.
what the hell is he doing?
campaigning.
come on back now, huh? We'll see you.
that's what I'm talking about. That is what I'm talking about. Praise God.
Frank. - Mr. Mayor.
how are we going to defuse this?
in about 90 seconds, we are going to enter that building and arrest the men who assaulted my officers.
don't you think negotiating would be a better idea?
Reverend Potter doesn't seem to want to talk.
we can't negotiate with ourselves.
let me speak with Reverend Potter.
you just did.
Frank, look around.
going in would be a mistake.
sir, sending a message to the crowd that assaulting a police officer doesn't have consequences,
that would be a mistake.
captain, you're a go. - Go now.
no, no, no!
that's not gonna happen.
no, no!
you see what's happening? You see this?
this is not justice! This is not justice!
give me your hands! Yes, you! Let's go, go, go!
you see what they doing to my church!
not on my watch! Not on my watch!
Oh, hell, no! This is not justice!
No! You need to witness up here!
this is not justice! This is a church!
sorry, Captain.
are you sure? I can keep them around while you think it over.
the guys who shoved us, they're not here.
they must've skipped out the back before we secured the building.
okay. Cut 'em loose.
there's a man with a gun-- he's robbing people at 122 Lenox.
I just ran out of there. He's a bad-ass.
got a gun. Be careful.
doesn't mention it's a church? - That's a funny thing.
even funnier thing is the call came from a pay phone in Washington Heights.
that's nowhere near 122 Lenox.
no. So what does he do? He runs out of a church in Harlem, doesn't stop till he gets to Washington Heights?
what's wrong? There's no pay phones between Harlem and Washington Heights?
no, it's a bogus call. - It's gotta be a bogus call.
but who would want to trick the cops into running into a prayer service?
I don't know. Let's go find out.
I'm sure we can work something out for Mr. Harten here.
sure. Since he was found in possession of four kilos of heroin and enough cocne to levitate Manhattan,
I think a guilty plea will settle things nicely.
he'll plead to Criminal Possession, Fourth Degree.
so, one Class C felony instead of two A-1's?
he'd take the maximum. - I... would?
Yeah. This is not Christmas, and I am certainly not Santa Claus.
well, I'll save you the trouble of a trial.
it's no trouble. The drugs were found in his refrigerator.
search warrant was valid.
his fingerprints were all over the wrappers.
plus he gives you a half-dozen dealers who buy from him in upper Manhattan.
Harlem to Washington Heights.
so he'd give us the guys who buy from him?
names, addresses, times, places.
Yeah, I think you forgot what we do here.
we give a deal to a little fish who gives us a big fish, not the other way around.
how about the people he buys from?
what, are you nuts? I like breathing.
looks like we're done here.
Manhattan North Narcotics says a guy, Otto Jackson, runs everything that goes on up here.
those guys probably all work for him.
looks like a narcotics convention's going on.
Yeah. That's the pay phone they made the 911 call from.
don't they all use their cells?
Ah, I guess so-- but they got eyes, so maybe we can get some citizen cooperation.
Hey! We're recruiting for a new game show.
come here! Come here...
don't worry, this won't take long. It's called Name That Tune.
we're gonna play you a tape, you're gonna tell us who's singing on it. You got it?
you busting me? - Not yet. Play the tape, Detective.
there's a man with a gun, he's robbing people at 122 Lenox.
I just ran out of there. He's a bad-ass.
got a gun. Be careful.
look at how fast your heart's pumping. I think you're ready to be our grand prize winner.
I don't know who that is. - Okay, empty your pockets then.
you ain't got probable cause.
you know what? We'll empty your pockets-- cuff him.
Yep. Come here. - You got anything sharp in there?
okay, okay, okay! Okay!
his name's Wendell. He lives... he lives over there. First floor in the rear.
okay.
he's kind of a dummy. - Unlike yourself?
Hey, I told you what you want.
you want your parting gift now? - Yeah, please. Thank you.
let's go see Wendell.
I'd appreciate it if you check the attitude at the door, Frank.
if it's all the same to you, I'd rather hang it on the back of my chair.
you need to talk to Potter.
if he has names and addresses for the men who assaulted my officers.
Frank, the only way we're gonna have that conversation, is to have the larger one first.
just try to put yourself in his position; see things from his perspective.
a bunch of white cops surrounded his church.
stop right there.
it was a bunch of cops surrounding his church.
white, black, Hispanic, female.
anyone who wants to paint my department as being all white, all male, all the time, had better check their facts.
all right, Frank. - No, it's not all right.
Mr. Mayor, I get real tired of seeing decades of progress in the ranks ignored for the sake of greasing the rhetoric.
the cops who were assaulted were white, the alleged perps were black-- that's all.
"be peaceful, be courteous, obey the law, respect everyone. But if someone puts this hand on you, send him to the cemetery."
Malcolm X.
and hello to you, too, Reverend.
this is a vital summit, Commissioner.
let's try to get off on the right foot.
now it's a summit?
I thought the three of us could sit down.
okay. Fine.
let's start with the names of the men who assaulted my officers.
Frank... - He makes conditions?
if this is a summit, that's the first thing on the agenda.
we need to begin by discussing the conditions that unde the tensions in my community vis-a-vis your department.
two from your community shoved two from mine down a flight of stairs.
Frank, please... - See what I'm talking about?
no willingness to work together, no interest in building consensus.
"a genuine leader is not a seeker of consensus but a molder of consensus."
martin Luther King.
I don't care if Frank Reagan won't talk to me.
I'm just one man.
but this is an insult to the community.
to all of us. To all of you.
we supported Mayor Poole in his election, and we demand that he remove Frank Reagan as police commissioner.
reagan must go! - Yeah.
reagan must go! Let 'em hear you. - Reagan must go.
let 'em hear you.
on time now. Let 'em hear you.
and if he won't do that, well, then guess what?
what? - We will remove Mayor Poole.
somebody needs to work on his people skills.
Nah, he's got 'em in the palm of his hand.
Oh, you meant me.
I know Potter takes himself way too seriously, but that doesn't mean you get to write him off.
he's a sideshow, Garrett. He doesn't matter.
no. He matters to the mayor.
Why? How many votes could he possibly control?
it was a close election, and it always will be with a minority candidate in this city.
Plus, there may be personal loyalty there.
both Potter and Poole started out working in the same anti-poverty programs.
which makes them, what, friends, allies, strange bedfellows?
does it matter?
Garrett, I don't want to start a war with the mayor.
who said you were?
say something.
we're getting a warrant to search Potter's church and office.
on second thought, don't say anything.
the men we're looking for are his people.
he's withholding information in a criminal investigation.
to recap, you're in this mess because you invaded Potter's church, so your next bright idea is to invade it again?
it will be the most polite search in NYPD history.
I've given strict instructions to conduct it as if they were tossing Mother Teresa's place.
there's a man with a gun. He is robbing people at 122 Lenox.
I just ran out of there. He's a bad-ass.
got a gun. Be careful.
so? - I don't know.
you don't know what, Wendell?
you don't know why you made the call? - I don't know.
you got to know something. I mean, you must have had a reason to make the call.
I don't know.
okay, let me make it easy for you.
do you know a guy named Otto? - Uncle Otto.
uncle Otto? Otto's your uncle?
Oh, okay.
did your Uncle Otto ask you to make the call?
you're supposed to report crimes.
that's what they told us in school.
yeah? - Kid's lawyer's here.
what? - Who called him? Take a wild stab.
sit tight.
Mr. Maxwell, the attorney.
Oh, you must be Uncle Otto.
Where's my nephew, detectives? You taking good care of him?
well, we're doing about as good as we can, considering his phony phone call caused a riot.
which, if true, constitutes Falsely Reporting an Incident in the Third Degree.
Yeah, that's right. - Which is a misdemeanor.
Plus, he's a juvenile.
and you may have noticed that he's also mentally challenged.
Yeah, I noticed. I also noticed that Uncle Otto is not mentally challenged.
is there any particular reason you put your nephew up to this?
now, I'm sure my nephew hasn't said any such crazy things.
come on, did you make the kid make the phony phone call to cause problems with Potter's church and the cops?
can we go see Wendell now?
go ahead.
come on.
have you people no shame?
actually, Reverend, yes.
uh, as a practicing Catholic, I have a great and deep sense of respect for, uh, any house of worship.
then get out.
then give us the names of the guys who pushed two New York City police officers down a flight of stairs, and we'll gladly go.
I was prepared to discuss that with the commissioner.
it's my understanding the commissioner does not negotiate police procedure.
Reverend, may we have your assistance in opening this locked door?
no, you may not. This is outrageous.
all right, well, if we're gonna have to jack the lock, it's gonna take a minute, and I'm sure you want us out of here as swiftly as possible.
my lawyer is on his way.
actually, uh, sorry, Reverend, but, um...
and stop with the "Reverend. " When you say it, it sounds...
...but the execution of this search warrant does not require us to wait for your legal representation to arrive.
and you cannot imagine what a locksmith costs these days.
Detectives-- got something.
right there.
church picnic?
a prayer retreat, upstate.
where Harriet Tubman worshipped and conducted the Underground Railroad.
helping hundreds of people escape slavery and retreat 'em.
sounds like a nice retreat.
that skinny guy right there.
Ah, don't touch it, Officer. It's church property.
this guy with the earring?
that's Shawn Hunter and Nathan Bradley.
well, well, well, any idea where we might be able to find these gentlemen, Reverend?
what's next, Frank?
you gonna send a Strip-o-Gram to his Sunday service?
you heard from Reverend Potter.
that search warrant was executed for legitimate purposes.
so this is nothing personal?
have you ever really listened to what he says about this department?
Frank, you're gonna have to understand Potter.
he comes from a long tradition of polemicists who serve as lightning rods to simply move the cause forward.
at the end of the day, his vision of the Promised Land is his own show on MSNBC.
okay, that is harsh.
you're right. I'm sorry.
maybe... I just wanted it to be him.
I'm not sure I'm following.
I asked the Special Frauds team at the DA's Office to give me what they had in ongoing investigations involving Potter.
$1. 2 million in federal funds unaccounted for from the West Harlem Jobs Training Program which Potter started along with...
you're investigating me?
not at all. But the two of you go way back.
you drill down or Potter, your name does tend to pop up.
what else were they looking into?
not for me to say. Ongoing investigation.
I see.
well, Frank, I don't know anything.
maybe nothing you can prove.
potter started out as a good guy, but there were rumors:
no-show jobs, odd people hanging around.
so I distanced myself. I left those programs.
I know that.
one of those odd people a guy named Otto Jackson?
Yeah. He and Potter were pretty tight. Why?
just a name comes up.
Really? In the D. A. files?
there is no ongoing investigation, is there?
well, I heard there was, but you'd have to confirm that with the D. A.
I have just been flipped by an NYPD detective.
former detective.
and sometimes we all need a little push to do the right thing.
I should fire you, Frank.
you can, but you won't, because you're a good man.
and you...are a pain in the ass.
I'll take that as a compliment.
um, how'd you get that, Uncle Jamie?
I took a flight of stairs with the wrong end of me.
you fell? - I was pushed.
uncle Jamie and his partner were pushed down some stairs. - Really?
papers made it sound like it was 'cause you were white.
nonsense. It's because he was blue.
the uniform.
what happened is there were some black men who thought that the white cops were trespassing in their church.
were they? - No, they weren't. They were doing their job.
well, that doesn't always matter.
shouldn't Grandpa have sent black cops instead?
should all your teachers be white just 'cause you are? And your coaches?
that would be stupid.
it's called "segregation," and it is dumb.
all this stuff is very complicated, you know?
I mean, on the one hand, you got white cops who walk the beat in black neighborhoods, and you know, sometimes they feel like not everybody trusts 'em just 'cause they're white.
you got black kids who feel like a white cop's gonna ask them just because they're black.
it's happened a million times in this country.
but I am an equal opportunity cop.
I don't care what color you are, what race you are.
you break the law, I'm breaking your head.
gandhi speaks.
so, how do we make it better?
one decent person at a time.
you put a knock on anybody who talks trash like that.
remember this: white, black, blue, purple, we're all the same color on the inside.
and in every gospel sermon and prayer in every church, temple and mosque, it all boils down to one sentence:
go out of here and treat everybody you meet a little better.
Amen.
and pass the potatoes.
so is our mayor still on the fence about this?
you know, I really think he'd like to see Reverend Potter gone, but black on black, he can't do it himself.
so he's gonna send in the white police commissioner?
can't call the fire department. He's not on fire.
who wants the last lamb chop? Nobody? Okay, pass it on down.
one lamb chop coming up.
it's a beauty.
so how does the white police commissioner get rid of the rabble-rousing minister?
well, you start by nailing him for the phony 911 call, which was only done to give Potter something to rant about.
wait, he made the phony 911 call?
technically, no. But a drug dealer and buddy of his did.
how do you know they were buddies?
I don't know. Dad dug it up.
why would a drug dealer do a favor for Potter?
he's the one that kicked them out of the neighborhood.
no... supposedly he kicked them out of the neighborhood.
you never know with a guy like Potter. It could have all just been a P. R. stunt.
especially when it comes to this Otto guy.
Otto Jackson?
you know him?
what, is he your dealer or something?
no, I heard his name the other day.
defense attorneys offer him up as part of a plea bargain.
great. Why don't you take it?
look, you get this guy to roll on Otto,
then we can use that to flip Otto against Potter.
I already turned him down. My case is solid.
Plus, this lawyer is this smug jerk who just hits on me all the time.
well, you know, you don't necessarily have to give the client a deal.
you could, you know, sleep with the lawyer.
come on, sis.
you got to learn how to take one for the team once in a while.
and the doctor says I'm all good now.
takes more than one flight down to crack this thick skull.
Marie's on her way up to get me now.
you need to have your head examined again, Sarge.
going home's supposed to be the good news.
Yeah, except now I got to eat her cooking again.
it's like dog food.
Hey. If it isn't Humpty and Dumpty.
you're talking to a wounded member of service here.
nice try, Sarge. Doc told me your head cracked the stairs, not the other way around.
he's funny.
Yeah, I was going to bring you some flowers, but instead I brought something for you, Jamie.
what's this?
well, once we got the names of the goons that did this to you,
TARU traced their cells. They're holed up in in Midtown.
since you can I. D. them, I was wondering if you want to come hit their door with me.
Yeah. - Yeah? Good.
what do you say, Sarge? Mind if I take the kid, show him how the real cops work?
go ahead, knock yourself out.
just don't forget what you learned.
good night, Sarge.
get on the ground! Go! Go!
easy, my man. Get your hands up!
we got the guy with the earring.
come on, bring him out. Come on, bring him out!
bedroom clear. - Check the back.
kitchen clear. - Let's go.
what do you say, kid? - Second bedroom clear!
these guys look like the guys? - Yeah, that's the guys.
you gentlemen remember this officer here? - I want my lawyer.
you want your lawyer? How about we get you a doctor instead?
what you going to do, throw us down the stairs now?
I don't know, you threw my kid brother down the stairs. What do you say?
no, it's the wrong century. It's a kinder, gentler NYPD.
be glad he's the forgiving type. Let's go.
a message from you at 10: 00 last night.
I hope I didn't miss a drunk dial.
I'm taking your deal, Larry.
and what happened to you not being Santa Claus?
we have a backlog here, and I have more serious cases, so...
no. There's something going on.
you want the deal or not, Larry? - Sure. Done.
your guy supplies evidence sufficient the half dozen dealers including one Otto Jackson.
done, done and doner.
all right. I'll draw up the papers.
does this mean you'll come see my apartment, too?
all right. There's the good Reverend Potter.
you ready to go, Otto?
that son of a bitch.
Aw, man, Harten, I swear, I'm gonna kill him!
Hey, you do remember you're wearing a wire, right?
I'm kidding, all right? I'm just kidding.
let's go over it again.
look, man, I've been through it with juries six times already. I know what I'm supposed to say.
you know it when I say you know it. Let's go over it again.
I go inside the restaurant. - Right.
I sit down with Potter. - Right.
get him to talk about the 911 call-- how he asked me to do it.
and then, you know, how he wanted to cause trouble and get his face back on the front pages...
front pages again, exactly. And you're going to keep on talking until...?
until he admits to it. - Right.
and if you don't get him to admit to it?
20 years in Attica.
I kind of like you, Otto. I hope you don't screw this up.
all right, time to go. Bon appetit.
is it true that you've been caught on tape admitting to setting up the false 911 call?
no comment. - Who did you tell to make the call, and why?
no comment.
do you have any words for the police officers... whose lives you endangered?
how do you explain... - Reverend Potter...
first time that fella's ever been speechless.
the press is having a field day.
that recording found its way to every media outlet in town.
how the hell did that happen?
good question.
the mayor made a statement.
one sentence, about how Potter is having no official or unofficial role in his campaign or his administration.
distancing himself.
distancing him, like, to Cleveland.
and Potter's office says he's out on a...
spiritual sabbatical.
you know, I heard an interview with Bernie Williams this morning on the radio, as I was coming in.
turns out he's the first guy to win the batting title, the Golden Glove, and the World Series ring all in the same year.
I know that. - Know what he does now?
what?
plays guitar.
well enough to record on a major label.
turns out he's been playing almost as long as he played baseball.
good for him. What's your point?
who said I had a point? - You always have a point.
scratch that-- you always think you have a point.
okay, how many times have I heard you go on about, you've got no talent or taste for politics.
and I was watching this week, and lo and behold, you've got a talent for politics.
up to and including today's little turn of events.
you won't find my fingerprints on that leak, ever.
it's as if Bernie Williams stepped up to the plate as a Yankee and instead of swinging a bat, picked up a Stratocaster and whipped off the Hendrix version of "The Star-Spangled Banner
I mean... who knew?
I think you could make a run for mayor.
seriously.
keep that thought to yourself. Seriously.
you got to admit, Gracie Mansion would be a nice place to retire from.
I like it, just fine, right where I am.
yet another example of Commissioner Reagan's extreme tactics and one that I don't see him practicing in the white neighborhoods.
this guy is dangerous.
only if you're standing between him and a television camera.
we supported Mayor Poole in his election, and we demand that he remove Frank Reagan as Police Commissioner.
no willingness to work together. No interest in building consensus.
a genuine leader is not a seeker of consensus, but a molder of consensus.
Potter, you're early.
commissioner Reagan, good to see you as always.
new look? - Part of a spiritual rebirth, if you will.
a new church, a new outlook, a new me.
couldn't help noticing the reporters camped outside.
thought we might say a few words after the meeting.
no, thank you. I won't keep you waiting long.
there's just one thing I have to take care of. Excuse me.
this isn't gonna work.
what, you don't like the beard? - The guy should be a felon.
and yet, it didn't surprise you when he walked on a technicality.
we had a case. -No we didn't.
that's why we leaked the story.
well, I don't like him. - Nor he you.
but this is the mayor's baby, and Potter comes with.
Frank, the gun buyback program does some good.
Oh, half the guns we pay 200 bucks for are barely functioning relics.
it's not Antiques Roadshow. We're just getting them off the street.
and if somebody's smart, they could dump evidence, and we got to pay them for it.
chance you take for a greater good.
that's not worthy of you, and I would rather have the money for more officer training.
Frank, we already said yes to this, so what are we talking about here?
I'm just venting. We're putting him back on the map with this, Garrett.
in exchange for which he's helping us get the word out in the community.
they trust him.
and if even a little of that trust spills over to the NYPD, it'd be hard to call this anything but a success.
as much as you hate to admit it, you know I'm right.
well, what are we waiting for?
your happy face?
close enough.
hurry up! Do not get my goods on the floor!
hurry... up!
I done told you. - I'm sorry.
you better not be stalling me, man.
that's all there is. - You holding out on me, old man?
no. Huh? - Take it easy, man.
that really necessary? - Man, shut your ass up.
I ain't playing with you, old man.
get over there. Open it. The good Oxy.
open it! Now!
better stop messing around. I'm tired of this.
no. Don't!
stop, man! Don't! Be cool.
Oh, my God! No, no!
yo, what happened? - I'm good. We got to go.
we got to go now!
second pharmacy hit in this neighborhood in as many weeks.
only this time, they came out shooting.
unbelievable. Guy comes in for some Band-Aids for his kid, and he gets a gut full of lead for his trouble. Any word on his condition?
Ah, he was unconscious when the bus arrived.
they were rushing him straight to surgery at St. Victor's.
and we're thinking this might have been an accident?
couple of witnesses outside said that the shooter seemed like the nice guy of the bunch.
said it seemed like the gun just went off.
anyone get a look at this Mr. Nice Guy?
uh, this is Miss De la Cruz..
she was near the victim before he tried to disarm the shooter.
she didn't get a look at the shooter's face, but she did get a look at the gun.
he kept sweeping it past my face, over and over again.
I'm sorry you had to go through that.
his gun- it was a Colt. 45 automatic.
that's pretty specific. - My father has one.
he taught me to shoot on it. - Really?
he didn't want me to be like one of those girls in the movies, don't know how to hold it right in case I ever needed to.
smart man. Do you remember anything else?
the grip. It wasn't black like usual.
more white with a pearl-like finish. I guess you did get a good look.
Yeah, someone holds a gun to your face that long...
I don't know that I'll ever forget it. I understand.
let's get a Finest out on these grips, and let's track these three amigos down soon before they start leaving more shells than pills around.
new York, our message is clear.
you give us your guns, and we will give you 200 bucks, no questions asked.
now, last month, Mayor Poole and Commissioner Reagan got 200 illegal guns off of our streets...
listen, we think we can do a lot better than that today.
no, I know we can do better. Now, what do you say?
now, now, now, now, come on, friends.
you're making me look bad up here.
now, I promised the mayor and Commissioner Reagan that we would deliver.
now, one more time. Are you ready?
I can't hear you.
that's what I'm talking about!
new beard, same old act.
well, it's not like we didn't see this coming.
we know how Potter loves the sound of his own voice.
to put it mildly. I will not go down there.
you don't have to.
no, I don't, do I? - Oh, no.
guy holds his own press conference, somebody's got to go, and it's not gonna be me. Baker?
I have a luncheon. Yankee Legends are gonna be there.
I see.
Yes, sir. - Baker, could you call the Yankees and tell them DCPI Moore is going to have to take a rain check today?
Yes, sir.
you'll keep me posted?
I'll live-blog for my Twitter feed.
Hey, Jack? - Yeah.
finest matches on the grips go out yet?
Yeah. Every cop in the city's looking out for a. 45 automatic with pearl grips, but there's nothing yet.
Oh. How about the customer that got shot?
he's alive, but the report from Ballistics just came back on the bullet.
there's no link to any other shootings. - When can we talk to him?
well, Doctor's gonna call me as soon as he comes to.
all right. Well, my CI's got squat as far as these robberies being gang-related, so it looks like this crew's unaffiliated.
you know, I was thinking, if those witnesses were right, and the shooter did show some heart when his gun went off, then it's only a matter of time before he gives up his buddies.
you think? - Oh, you never know.
you know, there's a reason that's a lottery slogan.
who you calling? - I got this guy who used to customize guns for lowlifes.
I'm thinking, pearl grips can't be too popular a choice.
that's true.
Hey, guys. - Hey. Beware the gluten-free meatloaf.
so, what's your point?
I'm not saying I want you to go all Sweet Valley High on me.
but I should ixnay the Pride and Prejudice? - At least until we get through Homecoming.
if we get through Homecoming.
I don't know.
I have a good feeling about it this year.
...what was that?
what was what? - You were flirting.
well, trying to anyway.
with Carlos?
I thought he was still with Amy.
all's fair in love and war.
you're terrible.
Oh, my God.
this...this isn't happening.
what a skank.
did you take one of these, too, Reagan?
Diane, wait!
always the quiet ones.
see you later. Bye, skank.
Veronica, thank you.
next time, bring some of your world-famous cookies for me, okay?
will do, Reverend. See you later.
Luis, thank you very much for coming. Ah, good to see you.
I appreciate your support. - All right. Yeah, always.
Mr. Deputy Commissioner. I didn't know we were expecting you.
and I didn't know you were holding a press conference.
well, as Deputy Commissioner of Public Information, I'd think you'd know better than anyone, if you're not using the media, they're using you.
anyone else you're using, Reverend? - Have I crossed the line?
I thought we were partners. I think I delivered.
you're here on our dime, not the other way around.
but you already knew that, which is why we didn't get the heads up.
so you're here to keep an eye on me, be my baby-sitter?
do you need to use the potty?
next.
Glock 19. Nine millimeter.
six rounds.
operable.
okay, sir, she'll give you your $200 bank card. Next!
colt. 45 automatic.
it's a beautiful piece. Pearl grips.
you don't see that a lot these days.
if you say so. My money? - Yeah, yeah, just give me a second.
you got that Finest message?
pearl grips.
is there a problem?
no, no. I'll be right with you.
Hey, hey, Ma. No, I'm good.
look, can I call you right back? I'm just... Am I getting my money or not?
Yeah, I really, really have to go, Mom.
okay. Gun's operable.
all righty, here you go. She has your money.
sorry for holding you up.
officer?
Reverend.
look, it's such a good thing you're doing out here today.
on behalf of the NYPD, we wanted to...May I see your phone, Officer? - I'm sorry?
now, Officer.
I- I... Excuse me. Hello.
everything okay here? - Yeah, he's trying to take my phone.
do you need a time-out, Reverend?
"no questions asked," and she's here trying to take pictures of these good people.
sir...
let me see it.
there are no pictures here, Reverend.
thank you, Officer.
next.
you know, as much as I don't like the guy, you shouldn't have lied to Reverend Potter.
when I gave him the phone, there was no picture 'cause I put it in my trash bin.
so, you lied to Deputy Commissioner Moore as well.
Oh, great, is there anyone else you'd like to invite to your disciplinary hearing? Look, Detective, I know what I did was wrong, technically.
technically?
come on, I got a guy handing in a gun that was just used in a shooting.
how do I look the other way on that and still wear the uniform?
sometimes wearing the uniform means you have to look the other way, okay?
it's "no questions asked. " That is the rule on the gun buyback program.
I'm a cop.
my job is to enforce the law, not the rules.
and all due respect, Detective, I didn't ask any questions.
go back to your precinct.
and not a word about this to anyone.
are you gonna use it? - Get back to your patrol.
you're starting to sound a little bit like your father. Give me a break.
all right, are we gonna use it?
I got the leads from my gun guy.
one of these names probably belongs to those pearl grips.
okay, and? - And what?
forget it; we're not using the picture.
we can. You just won't. - Yeah, because it's wrong.
it's kind of wrong.
okay, well, I'll remind myself to use that one when we get ourselves kind of jammed up.
look, she took the picture- that was wrong; we agree on that- but it's done already.
you can't put the genie back in the bottle.
no, but we don't have to go asking the genie for three wishes either.
did I miss something around here?
since when did we start following the rules? - Jack, this is different.
all right, it's the mayor and my old man and the Reverend Potter. It's just...It's political, all right?
just forget about it.
all right, great. I'm on my way.
look, our victim's awake.
why don't you see if you can get any traction on those leads.
I'll get started with the victim. Meet me at the hospital. - Yeah.
and forget about using the picture.
Frank, we got 500 guns off the street, we made a friend out of an enemy, and for once, we might even get some good ink.
you sound like you're selling tickets. - It's a win, Frank.
we should just take the W and move on.
when are you going to tell me about the problem?
there was no problem. - Really?
it was nothing.
just Potter being Potter.
he had a few words with one of our cops. - Really?
he claimed she was taking pictures of the people donating guns.
said she was violating our "no questions asked" policy.
Really?
as you might expect, he was long on accusations, short on evidence.
is he going to leave it alone?
hard to say.
I want to talk to the officer.
Frank, it's done.
Really?
just think back to the robbery at the drugstore, okay Mr. Cunningham?
you gotta keep trying so we can find the guy who shot you.
all right, look, Jimmy explained this to you, right?
we're not looking for a positive ID on any of these photos.
we're just looking for similar features, okay?
you see something that resembles the guy- the eyes, the nose, Jimmy puts it into the sketch. Can you just try a little more?
Yeah. All right.
I got it.
I don't know.
I really don't.
just keep going; I'll be right back.
this guy is pretty weak, Jack. I don't think he's gonna help.
how about the pearl grip? - Nada.
Pearl-gripped hardware is not as rare as you'd hoped.
but, um... I did run ballistics on it.
I did not run ballistics on a gun we're not supposed to have.
all right, I'm not asking, but if I was, what does it say?
it's a match.
the gun that Perez intercepted at the buyback is the same one that put this guy in the bed; are you sure?
Yes. And the guy in that picture could be the shooter, Danny.
but he'd have to be crazy.
what do you mean, someone's gonna use a gun in a shooting and turn around and hand it over to the police?
how many smart shooters have you met?
so, start from the eyes, and just move down to the slope of the nose.
does anything look familiar at all?
I... I'm-I'm not sure.
did he have a wide nose, maybe a high bridge?
as I recall, I'd say it was wide.
wide.
any distinguishing features around the nose?
not that I can think of.
let me see those photos, okay?
okay.
working on the bridge of the nose, right?
all right.
okay.
either of these two guys, they resemble your guy?
um, I think so.
this one, all right. Okay.
what's next? - Uh, the mouth.
the mouth, all right.
this guy's mouth look similar at all to you? - Yeah, it does.
okay, there you go. Put that in there, all right?
sir, you think you could, uh, just look at this picture?
just need a moment of your... right. Ma'am, you want to take a look at this?
uh, you know him, or maybe seen him in the neighborhood...
Hey, hold on, hold on. Look, these guys are robbing pharmacies...
yo no se nada. Come on! Sal de aqui. Vete!
Hey, you seen this guy?
come on, you help me find a bad guy, you can keep ignoring me like you're doing right now.
Oh, yeah, that one,I know this guy.- Says he knows this guy.
Yeah, I know this guy. Yeah, we can't talk over here, though.
let's go inside.
okay.
Hey, it's-it's me again.
look, Diane, I don't blame you for not wanting to talk to me.
I should've stuck up for you. And I am so sorry.
call me.
please.
everything cool?
Yeah, just calling a friend about homework.
a friend at school's just going through some stuff.
I may not be a detective yet, but I was a teenager.
promise you won't tell Mom?
she'd go all D. A. on me.
Yeah.
haven't you ever heard of the blue wall of silence?
someone got their hands on my friend's selfy and spammed it to everyone in the school.
okay, one more time in English. A selfy?
it's a sexy picture you take of yourself.
Oh, okay.
I see what you mean.
the whole school turned on her and I just... sat there...
frozen.
I should have said something.
I should have done something.
do you want to know what your grandfather would say?
that he's disappointed?
that a Reagan doesn't do that?
he'd say it's what you do next that counts.
for my fifth birthday, my mother bought me Princess slippers.
I cut off the toes, turned them into holsters.
you love the job.
a little too much if you're listening to my mother.
top ten in your graduating class.
two years on the job, and already several commendations.
do you know why I asked to see you?- Not really, sir, no.
well, I understand you had a run-in with Reverend Potter yesterday.
that was nothing, sir. A small misunderstanding.
well, small or not, still, we wanted to thank you.
thank me? The reverend means well, but like many of us, sometimes his lesser qualities overshadow his greater ones.
we wanted to thank you for treating him with respect in the face of some pretty insulting accusations.
Reverend Potter's charge wasn't without merit, was it?
at roll call, the sergeant read out a Finest message.
pearl handle on a Colt automatic.
I'm not at my post 20 minutes when what comes walking in.
colt with a pearl handle. -I got a bad guy standing right there in front of me.
every cell in my body is screaming I got to do something.
but the reason it's not on the phone when I check it?
I deleted it while you and the reverend were talking.
but it was still in your trash bin.
commissioner, I am so sorry.
think this bodega owner gave us the wrong address?
maybe. We'll give it a little longer.
Yeah.
look like our guy over there?
looks like him to me.
let's go see.
Whoa! Hey, hold up!
come here!
come here. Get on your feet. Turn around.
put your hands against the vehicle. Look... Spread your legs!
you know, if you pull your pants up next time, you might get away.
what the hell did I do?-I don't know.
I got a guy with a belly full of led who thinks you fed it to him.
what do you think, Jack? -Twins.
I agree. Let's go. -No, man.
shut up.
so, what did I do?
who says you did anything?-I don't know.
jamie you have a drink with, you want to unwind.
Erin, you want to give advice.
you want to throw one back with me, it's usually 'cause I screwed something up.
heard you like a guy for the pharmacy shooting.
Yeah, we like him pretty good.
how did you get to him?
bodega owner recognized him from a sketch we got from a eyewitness.
yeah? Mm-hmm.
that's good police work.-Thank you.
this your guy?
did you use it?
officer Perez came to me. She showed me the photo.
I sent her packing, I crumpled it up.
did you use it? -Not exactly.
not exactly.
the witness was having trouble getting the sketch going right.
I made a few suggestions. So you not only blew off our No Questions Asked policy.
you coached a witness into making an ID.
I made a suggestion, I gave him a nudge in the right direction.
have you booked him? We're holding him.
he walks.
that... If I got to bend the rules a little bit to get a bad guy off the street,
I'm gonna do it, and you would, too.
the hell I would. The hell you didn't.
all right, kid, get lost.
what? We're cutting you loose.
here's your hat. What's your hurry? Hey, why-why you letting me go?
look, would you just beat it before I fall down on your fist?
assaulting an officer will keep you here another eight hours. I'm going.
and pull up your pants. Hey, what's going on, Reagan?
I leave for a couple of hours, you letting the prisoners go?
Oh, Jack, you remember I told you we were gonna get jammed up?
guess what. We got jammed up.
I am sorry, Danny.
we'll live. How'd it go at the hospital? Worse.
I spent the last hour doing a photo array with the victim.
Mm-hmm. He saw Banks's picture ten different ways. Didn't pick him once.
great. So he's not even our guy.
let's pull the fives on the other witnesses, all right?
I'm gonna read their statements again.
wait. What are we doing? -We're gonna start from scratch.
Diane, wait! -Guess I'm not a social leper anymore?
Diane, I'm sorry.
now. Practically let 'em pin a scarlet letter on me the other day.
look, you have every right to be mad at me.I was wrong
but I'd really like to make it up to you.
how? Do you have a time machine?
no, I got something way better than that.
an uncle with a hook in TARU. -You think I need to move to another country.
this is worse than I thought. TARU's not a country.
it's a division of the NYPD.
tactical Assistance Response Unit.
what are you talking about, Nicky?
my Uncle Jamie's looking into who spammed that text to everyone.
What?!
he's going to find out who did this to you.
Oh, my God, Nicky. No! Diane, I... Listen to me.
if you really want to help, just drop it.
I just want to forget that this ever happened.
you know, Jack, one of my first cases.
we like this bike messenger for an assault coming off a, uh, bar fight in Chelsea.
it was nasty.
the bartender caught the business end of a longneck right in the throat.
he made it through, but the thing is, the detective that I caught with was certain that the bad guy was gonna come back and finish the job.
so certain, he put a uniform outside the bartender's walk-up.
sure enough, that night, he hears a noise.
he goes around the back, he looks up in the fire escape, and he sees the bike messenger. It looks like he's got a piece.
just as the cop's about to blast him, he realizes that the bike messenger is not carrying a piece.
it's actually a freaking rose. -A rose?
Yeah. It turns out, the bike messenger and the bartender were boyfriends.
they-they didn't have a bar fight.
they had a knock-down, drag-out lovers' quarrel.
all right, so, that's a great story, but...
I mean, what are you thinking? That the shooter is sleeping with the victim?
no, no, no. That's not...
look, each and every one of these statements
all the witnesses are saying the same thing.
that the shooter was showing compassion during the robbery, like he didn't want anybody to get hurt.
all right, so you think he feels bad, you think maybe he goes by the hospital to make sure the guy pulls through.
anything can happen, right? -I'll get the hospital.
Jack, tell 'em to make sure they give us all the surveillance video they got anywhere near the victim's room, all right? -Yeah, yeah.
officer Perez.
commissioner.
officer Perez. -As you were.
I'll be brief.
I know you're in the middle of your tour, and Central's holding jobs.
when you return to your precinct, your desk sergeant is gonna give you a two-day rip.
that's for violating department policy.
Yes, sir.
you're losing your seat in the car for a few tours.
you'll be walking a foot post.
and you might want to drop by Reverend Potter's church.
he's always looking for volunteers. -Of course, sir.
officer Perez, what you did was wrong.
but the instincts that drove you to do what you did
well...
I'd ride with you in a radio car any day.
that is all. -Thank you, sir.
volunteer at Potter's church?
please tell me that doesn't mean you're going to tell Potter?
well, Garrett...
the truth will set you free.
Hey, Nicky.
Nick! -Uncle Jamie?
where is he?!
what, what? N- No, look, he's not...
I'm on it, Jack. -Oh! Sit down.
down! Terrence!
hold it!
what is wrong with you Banks brothers, huh?
you guys love to run, don't you? -I didn't...
you didn't what?! -I didn't mean to shoot that guy.
it comes with the territory when you're robbing people at gunpoint.
get on your feet.
come on. Come on.
Hey, hey, look, man, it's not his fault.
it's that crew he runs with. Right. Okay, look, they don't give him any choice.
well, you know what they say- you are who your friends are.
okay, look, what if he gives 'em up?
okay, would you cut him a deal? Let me ask you a question.
why'd you turn in your brother's gun, Benjamin?
look, I found it in his room while he was asleep, okay?
I didn't know anything about the shooting. I just wanted it out of our place.
I told you to stay out of it. -You spend your whole life trying to cover for this kid?
and this is the thanks you get.
look, he's my brother. - Yeah, and you almost did a bid for him.
now say good-bye.
I'm sorry, Benny.
look, man, look, d- d-don't worry. I'm gonna get you a lawyer.
don't say anything.
step away from the car, Benjamin.
you wanted to talk?
thanks for meeting me. -My mom's waiting.
right. Well, I spoke to my uncle.
after I asked you not to. -Pathetic much?
junior college much?
long overdue.
anyway, I wanted to tell you what my uncle found out.
I know what he found out. I can explain.
whoever hacked into your phone must have been a geek genius.
they put up some kind of firewall or something, I don't know.
anyway, I'm sorry, but it's untraceable.
thank you.
for what it's worth, I know that what I did was so not normal.
Diane, we're in high school.
there's no such thing as normal.
besides, it's what you do next that counts.
hang this weekend?
definitely.
knock, knock.
mom, what are you doing here? -Playing hooky.
you want to join? -What do you have in mind?
shopping spree, mani-pedi?
no?
anything you would like to do?
well, if you promise not to spaz out too much.
how about just a cozy movie night at home?
I can handle that.
looked like you were having a pretty serious conversation with Diane.
mom.
okay, okay.
congratulations, Mr. Mayor, every paper in town is touting the success of the gun buyback program, but the real feather in your cap comes from the Ledger.
this is an advanced copy of tomorrow's editorial.
they cite your leadership and steadfast support as the key ingredients.
well, it's easy to be a stalwart when you feel so strongly about the cause.
Oh, they got it right this time, Mr. Mayor.
you put this coalition together. You deserve all the credit.
actually, Reverend, they reserved their most lavish praise for you.
F. Scott Fitzgerald famously said "there are no second acts in American lives."
well, somebody forgot to tell Reverend Darnell Potter.
just "he proved the best way to right a wrong is by doing good, "and what good he did:
over 500 guns off the street.
well done, Reverend.
thank you, Commissioner.
Oh, this means a great deal.
that is not to say there wasn't a hiccup.
really, Frank, a hiccup?
Reverend Potter, this is confidential. I'm gonna have to trust you with this.
one of the guns we bought back was used in a robbery and a shooting earlier that morning.
if that gets out, that could taint everything that we worked for.
Yeah, I'm afraid it could.
I have everything here and I'll be happy to share it with you.
Mr. Mayor, this is a need-to-know file and New York Police business.
frankly, you have no need to know, and I would like to keep it that way in order for you to maintain plausible deniability.
well, Frank, you know I've always trusted your judgment in these matters.
if it is indeed need-to-know, it's that way for a reason.
Reverend?
well, like, my great- grandmother used to say, only a fool goes looking for a rainstorm in the sunshine.
good.
very good. I'll say good night, then.
Reverend Potter.
good night, Commissioner. Frank. Mr. Mayor.
Hey, hey, hey, you wash your hands?
let me see. -Yeah. Yep.
let me see other side.
try again, this time don't be afraid of the soap.
okay. Incoming.
come on, it's still my house, you know. Might be, but it's my chicken.
I know it pisses you off, I don't do the job the way you did it.
you know what pisses me off?
when I bust your chops for doing the things you think I used to do myself.
Yeah.
what makes you think that I used to bend the rules?
I work with guys every day that you used to work with, Dad.
more often than not, the end results of the things we do wind up being more about luck than skill.
I was always lucky.
that's how we're most alike.
I just don't want to see your luck run out.
so I guess you were looking out for me.
no, I was being the commissioner.
you guys done?
dinner's ready.
okay, who wants to say grace? I said it last week.
don't even look at me. I always say it.
well, one of the boys can say it.
Yeah. - No.
I want to say it. -Well, what do you know?
bless us, our Lord, and these gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty, through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Hey, guys, why don't you go upstairs and wash your hands before dinner?
I know I only met you guys at the wedding, but the amount of times your name comes up here, you would think that we were next-door neighbors.
well, we practically are now. Just over the bridge.
don't tell anyone, but I think he missed you.
well, I might've told some stories from the old days now and again.
Aw, do you miss me, buddy? Yeah, you know I do.
Oh, you should talk.
this one goes on about his boyhood BFF so much, when our kids were little, they thought Danny Reagan was the name of a superhero.
it's not?
she's funny. She's funny.
no, but all jokes aside, it's... having you guys here, it's like an early Christmas present. Same here.
and it's permanent now? It's official?
I mean, no more Florida?
Bye-bye, Boca. Hello, Bay Ridge.
Hello, Bay Ridge.
no, you know, with my mom being sick, it was time to come home.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that.
Thanks.
sit down, relax. Thank you.
but you know what's nice is that we'll actually get to know you guys after all these years.
Yeah, we should make something official, like, uh, once a week, either dinner or a game or something.
done and doner. All right.
we just hope you're happy here and you don't miss Florida too much.
speaking of missing Florida...
you must've done pretty well down there in the Sunshine State, my friend, with that, uh, snazzy Benz you pulled up in.
I got lucky.
I wind up in real estate after college.
right time, right place, I guess.
Mickey's being modest. He works really hard to give our family life's little extras.
babe, I'm gonna, um, take the trash cans out, okay?
Danny, we're about to sit. Yeah, I know. It's, uh...
if I don't do it now, I'll forget, so...
Tobotobally.
what on earth was that?
ob. I never told you about ob? Ob?
Yeah, it's- it's their secret language from fifth grade? That's right.
Danny made me learn that before we got engaged. Oh, brother.
Yeah. Here, have some more.
we're gonna need it.
the perp came running out of the liquor store with a bag of cash, and the clerk right behind him with a baseball hat.
I yelled, "Police, don't move."
I saw a flash, and the next thing I know, I'm lying here.
that flash was a. 9 millimeter in the hand of the wheelman.
I should have seen him coming. He was around a corner.
when he heard you, he came out blasting.
there's nothing you could have done.
the good news is the doctor says you're going to be just fine.
Yeah, he thinks I can go home tomorrow. With a medal pinned to your chest.
rest up. Thank you, Commissioner.
the press is going to want a few words.
what else is new? Commissioner.
as you were. Officer Wallace.
Yes, sir. Partner's doing fine.
and you both did good work. Well, we could have done better, sir.
he came out of a blind spot. You didn't stand a chance.
that's just it, sir. That perp never should have had that gun.
the shooter- I saw him casing that shop four hours earlier.
he kept patting his hip, you know, like there was a gun there...
but you didn't question him.
because of the new restrictions on Stop, Question and Frisk?
the judge says we could get sued personally if we do a wrong stop.
and you didn't want to take any chances.
I screwed up, didn't I?
no, son.
we did.
Hey, top of the morning, Sarge. There you are. Follow me.
little coffee first, boss? Now.
I got someone who needs to talk to you.
okay.
and bah humbug to you, too.
reagan, this is Lieutenant Sutton from OCID.
lieutenant. Is there a problem?
well, frankly, that's what we're here to find out.
this is you, isn't it, Detective? Yeah.
that was you taking pictures at my house?
Yes, it was. What the hell is going on here, Sarge?
you got OCID sitting on my house, taking pictures of me and my family?
no, they weren't taking pictures of you, Danny.
like hell they weren't. We weren't on you, Detective.
we were on your pal, Michael Patrick.
what... what the hell would OCID want with Mickey?
well, maybe because he's a known member of the Vasquez Family...
come on. ... the biggest crime family in Florida.
right. And I'm the Lord of the Dance.
I'm not horsing around, Detective.
look, it can't be, okay? It's not even possible.
last month, the key players from the top families across the country held a summit masquerading as a golf outing.
Yeah, right. Okay.
now, look, you got the wrong guy. Okay? Mickey's into real estate.
want to tell me what your buddy in real estate was doing with them?
there he is, with the rest of the Vasquez capos.
Mickey's a gangster?
have a seat, Detective. We're gonna be here a while.
quality of life crime is up 30%.
violent crime is up 20.
a judge rules against Stop and Frisk and basically says, "My work here is done.
and now you see the results.
we've got a wounded cop that almost didn't make it home to his family because this judge won't let our cops do their jobs.
this department dates back to 1845.
that's a whole lot of good police work done before anyone came up with Stop and Frisk.
I think we should get these numbers in front of the press.
to what end?
to get public opinion back on our side.
in an effort to...? Ignite debate.
Oh, come on, Garrett.
the last thing in the world this issue needs is more debate.
all due respect, I think Garrett is right.
people see those crime numbers, they might rethink the issue.
well, a lot of good it's gonna do them. The judge has ruled.
it's a bad call. Shouldn't we try to change it? Our job isn't to change the law.
our job is to uphold the law- even the ones we don't like.
Frank, in all the years I've known you, I've never once seen you willing to give up.
who the hell said anything about giving up?
he never gave any hints about his mob ties? No.
look, as far as I knew, Mickey was making a killing selling beachfront property to the Boca blue hairs. Well, he wasn't.
he was help bringing their crime business to the 21st century.
setting up shell companies, offshore accounts, et cetera.
okay, so if he's some Florida mob big shot, why'd he come back home?
expanding.
the Vasquez family has been building up relationships with some of the organized crime outfits up here.
your buddy Mickey is the go-between.
if what you're saying is true, well, then, I guess Mickey...
he deserves whatever he's got coming. I'm glad you feel that way.
good. Let me know how it goes.
actually, we were hoping you could help.
Yeah. Thanks, but no thanks. Well, you said it yourself.
he deserves what he's got coming. If what you're saying is true.
it is.
okay, suppose it is. It's a bad play.
Mickey's no idiot. He knows I'm a cop.
he's not gonna spill mob secrets to me just 'cause we goofed around on the monkey bars as kids.
I agree. We have to get creative.
look, there are a thousand other detectives who you could put on this besides me.
Yes, but there's only one that he trusts.
does it mean anything to you that he's my friend, that we grew up together?
means everything. Means you could get close.
you could put him in a compromising position.
it means if we flip him, we just took down the biggest mob operation in 20 years.
and it also means that I will have sold my soul.
I got cases to work.
right now, I'm asking for your help, Detective.
but I don't have to ask.
Mickey is a wise guy? That's what I'm saying.
it can't be, right?
well, I'm surprised, but I'm not exactly blown away.
what do you mean? It's not like I was an angel.
I mean, every time Mickey got in trouble, I was right there with him.
Yeah, which is why Dad never liked you hanging around him and always kept you on a short leash.
don't remind me.
you remember that time you guys got caught for shoplifting down at Jim Duffy's five and dime?
Yeah. Thought the old man was gonna pull the slapper out for sure.
Yeah, and that's when Mom wanted to send you to military school.
do you know why?
let me guess: because Mickey was a bad influence?
no. Because she always thought you had a blind spot when it came to Mickey.
you know, there's a story about that day that I never told anyone.
Mickey was halfway home when the cops rolled up on me.
now, anyone else would've kept going, but he didn't.
when he heard I was getting pinched, he turned around and he took the rap with me.
okay, so now he's a stand-up guy, is that it?
Oh... maybe.
maybe you still have a blind spot.
or maybe OCID got it wrong.
if they were coming to get you to lock up one of your friends, would you just take their word for it?
okay, you have a point, Danny.
if I was going after one of my friends,
I would make damn sure they were no good first.
talk to me.
Danny, 3151 West 49th Street.
I'm on my way.
I'll meet you in the lobby.
he just got off on 16. Sixteen.
punch me in the face.
what?
I'm not kidding. Come on, hit me.
detective, what the hell's going on?
we tailed Mickey.
keyed his way into an office on Madison under the name of Gator Empire, Inc.
it's a shell corp for the Vasquez family.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, so am I.
so, does this mean that you're in? On one condition.
you got to offer him witness protection. Done.
all right, go ahead and punch me. You're nuts.
just do it already.
come on, come on! You betting the ponies, Reagan?
I got a little action going, come on. Come on, come on! A lot of action?
he's ten lengths behind this horse!
how does he lose that race?!
unbelievable. Bartender! Two more.
Danny, how much you bet?
he's the back end of my double.
you bet a daily double? Reagan, that's a sucker bet.
Yeah, well, call me a sucker.
no, not the Danny Reagan I know.
now, why don't you tell me how you got a black eye?
don't worry about it, okay?
no, you know, that's what I do because that's what friends do.
look, I tell you, you can't tell a soul, okay?
no. Not even Connie.
I sobwobear obon moby lobife.
what's going on? Come on.
I'm in a hole, Mick.
yeah? Yeah.
how deep? 12 feet.
$12, 000? Things just got a little out of hand.
that's all. A lot out of hand, Danny.
you know how it is, Mick. I fell behind, I tried to double up and catch up.
stupid horse was gonna be my Hail Mary.
she didn't come through for you. No.
built a real house of cards.
behind on the car payment, the kids' tuition, took out a pension loan.
it's only a matter of time before Linda finds out, and that's when I'm really screwed.
listen to me.
I'm gonna help, all right? I'm gonna give you the money. No, no.
you're gonna pay me back when you can.
no interest. I insist. No, forget about it.
forget about it. Danny.
Mick, you and I both know what money does to friendships.
you've been gone all these years, you just got back;
I'm not gonna screw this up over my problems, no way.
I hear you, but what are you gonna do?
put in some overtime, couple odd jobs, I guess.
12 grand in overtime?
what other choice do I have?
well, let me think about this, look...
I might know a guy that might be able to give you some work.
yeah? Yeah, but no promises.
and no more betting. All right, no more betting.
Mr. Mayor.
I just got word from the hospital that they will be sending Officer Powell home this afternoon.
that's good news.
Yes, he's recovering nicely.
his partner's wounds, however, might take a while longer to heal.
I'm sorry, Frank, I wasn't aware there was another officer injured.
well, a few hours before the shooting, his partner observed the shooter and thought he might be carrying a weapon.
but fearing that a judge might rule his actions to be a violation of civil rights, he chose not to stop and question the individual.
if you've come here to tell me that your men and women are handicapped...
I didn't. ... because they can no longer toss black men against the wall for no reason, you've come to the wrong person. Aw, cut it out.
I know exactly where this is going, Frank.
no, you don't.
I'm not here looking to reopen Stop, Question and Frisk.
but our crime stats are now headed in the wrong direction.
I've seen the numbers, and I'm confident you can turn them around.
the judge's new rules say we must have significant cause before we stop and question individuals.
that's how it is. But we'd like some help.
Frank, I'll do anything I can to help.
you know that.
good.
I would like you to go to the press and explain that See Something, Say Something no longer applies to just stray backpacks and unattended luggage.
if we're gonna stop someone, we need to show just cause, and a phone call from a concerned citizen goes a long way.
Frank, you want me to ask the people of our city to be on the lookout for crime?
that's gonna make people nervous.
Mr. Mayor, the last two decades have shown dramatic decreases in crime.
our job is to sustain that under new and more challenging conditions.
but we can't do it alone.
let me think about it.
you don't want to go near this.
Frank, I said let me think about it.
please do.
you know, I can't believe you got a table in this place.
we've been trying to come here for months. How did you do it?
Oh, Mickey has a fancy friend.
some Wall Street guy I sold a house to, that's it.
well, that's what we need, hon. We need a fancy friend.
well, we got a fancy friend of a friend, how's that? Yeah!
you boys are funny. I gonna step to the ladies room.
Linda? I am right behind you.
see you in an hour. Ah. You're in better spirits, huh?
it's an act.
I don't want Linda getting suspicious. Did you speak to your friend?
Yeah, about that, I didn't mean to get your hopes up, Danny.
look, I don't think that thing's a good idea.
what are you talking about, Mick? Why not?
he's not the kind of guy you want to be involved with.
well, who is he? Danny, just let me lend you the money.
no. Listen, it's not gonna come between us, okay? You know what?
I'll give it to you. No strings.
consider it a gift. Done.
so, I'm a charity case now, is that it? Danny, you got it all wrong.
do I?
sounds to me like you're saying that you're the fancy big shot and I'm the guy looking for a handout here.
that's not what I'm saying at all.
Mick, just introduce me to the guy.
let me figure it out for myself, okay? Make the connection.
look, I got into this jam on my own.
Danny, look at me.
we're not talking about hanging some drywall for some extra bucks.
you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, I do.
you're okay with that?
it's the only shot I got, Mick.
all right.
call you tomorrow. We'll sit down and talk.
okay? Okay.
okay, whatever he says, you make sure you get it on tape.
on tape? Whoa.
nobody said anything to me about wearing a wire. Well, he wants to meet in an hour.
we have no lead time to wire the place. It's too risky.
and so is me walking into the church with that thing stuck to my chest.
he's your friend. He trusts you.
he may look stupid, but he's actually pretty smart.
he's not smarter than you. You know how to play him.
besides, we'll be right around the corner.
one word from you, and we'll storm the place like it's Normandy.
normandy was a bloodbath. Not my best analogy.
but you got my word, we'll take care of you.
I'll take care of myself, thanks. Give me the wire.
what are we doing here, Mickey?
Christmas time.
I love coming to church this time of year.
right. Why, you got the creeps?
well, yeah, a little bit.
me and you here like this, it's a little creepy.
it looks... smaller, doesn't it?
I don't know. I'm here all the time. Looks the same to me.
I remember being... terrified coming in here as a kid.
really felt the eyes of God on you, didn't you?
Yeah. Yeah, tell me about it.
you, um... want to go get a slice?
no, in a minute. Let's talk.
we're gonna talk here?
no, not here. Up there.
up... there? What? Like old times.
when we were altar boys. But first...
the new millennium.
huh, Danny? Eyes and ears everywhere, and...
what we have to discuss today, best kept between friends.
Yeah. Of course.
thank you. Thanks.
what are you doing?
no offense, Danny, you're a cop.
And?
and... I would be stupid not to take precautions.
come on. You want to pat me down?
well, I don't want to.
I'm not wearing a wire, Mickey. Then you won't mind showing me.
since when is my word not good enough for you?
come on, Danny. Your word's good enough for me.
we're gonna be discussing third parties, and I'm afraid your word, not good enough for them.
so, may I?
of course.
all right, okay, let's talk.
what the hell happened? Why didn't we hear anything on the wire?
cause I took this damn thing off before I even walked in the door, that's why.
and it's a good thing. Otherwise, you'd be at a cop funeral right now.
you pulled the wire and still went through with the sit-down?
Yeah, and Mickey said enough to incriminate himself. That's great.
too bad it's of no use to us- it's your word against his.
you know they make apps for everything these days?
you recorded it on your phone? He took my phone before I sat down, but... I had a second phone stashed in my ankle holster, and I recorded every word. You happy?
nice work, Detective. Yeah, some victory. Whoo- hoo.
I'll tell you how to beat this thing.
ignore it. Tell every cop to go out there and do the job, like they've done before.
great idea. And open up each and every one to a lawsuit, Pop.
what they gonna do, sue 35, 000 cops?
nonsense.
let this mess crumble under its own weight.
and if it doesn't, you're carrying a mortgage, you're saving for your kid's college.
the legal fees alone would wipe you out.
pop, what kind of a PC orders his people to break the law?
the judge's rule was wrong. That's an opinion.
but the fact is the judge has ruled, and we have to live with it, like it or not.
well, I don't like it, and neither should you.
I didn't say I did.
so, as a cop, where do you come down on this?
as a cop?
professionals are valued for their instincts, their ability to react, whether you're a cop or an NFL quarterback.
I can think of no other profession where you're told to bench your talents, and then you're penalized if you don't.
honestly, this ruling makes the job ten times harder.
But? But I think the judge has a point.
I think Stop and Frisk is an effective instrument that started to be overused.
cops going too far with it. That's part of it.
there's something else?
a lot of cops started to get lazy.
a few years ago, Stop and Frisk was just one of many ways that we could get guns off the streets. It was a potent tool.
so potent that bosses started to encourage us to abandon all other means in favor of this one method.
so the shortcut became the favorite route.
and I'm the boss of those bosses.
didn't mean it like that. Sure, you did.
you're saying this falls on my shoulders.
and you're right.
Hey, Danny boy! Mickey.
what's the matter?
Oh, no, don't tell me you're betting again.
no betting, Mickey. No?
in fact, there was never any gambling trouble at all.
I'm not following.
it was a play, Mick. What are you telling me?
I'm telling you I got a recording of you offering me money for sensitive NYPD information.
Danny, listen to me. Some kind of joke, it's not funny.
it's no joke. It's real and it's happening, so do me a favor, get your hands out of your pockets, get 'em up in the air. Come on.
you framed me? Come on, Mick.
you framed me, Danny, your oldest friend?
you set me up?
turn around.
okay, okay.
give it up. Give it up!
I don't kill anybody.
Oh, so that's supposed to make what you do okay, hmm?
I'm just a businessman, Danny.
I'm good at making deals, that's all.
what kind of deals you making, huh, Mick?
hmm? Drugs, gambling, prostitution, what?
do you even hear yourself?! No, no, I don't do any of that stuff.
I'm not involved with any of that. I put people together.
I buy and sell companies, I move some money around.
that's it, okay? I got nothing to do with anybody getting hurt.
but they do get hurt!
and if it's not you, it's your associates, which makes you just as guilty!
don't you get that?!
what the hell happened to you, huh? Why did you do this?
I didn't know I was doing it, Danny.
I was just a young hotshot good at making deals.
these guys saw it, they paid me a premium to do the exact same thing on a larger scale with them.
by the time I realized who they were...
it's too late.
well... maybe it's not too late.
how bad is it? Ten years bad.
maybe 15.
unless you're willing to work with me.
don't even say it. You got to testify against them, Mick.
not possible.
you got to put these animals where they belong, behind bars.
Danny, you know.
I speak one word against the Vasquez family, and that's as good as me putting Connie and the boys in a body bag myself.
Mick, we'll protect you.
we'll put you and Connie and the boys in witness protection where you'll be safe!
at least you'll have a chance!
and then what?
Connie never sees her mother ever again?
my boys have to give up my name?
and become a couple of nobodies living in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah. Maybe you'd rather they just stare at you through six inches of Plexiglas for the next ten years, huh?
what?
my name is Charles Bryce.
I'm the attorney of record, and my client has nothing more to say.
that's how it's gonna be, Mick? Nothing to say?
not a word.
turn around.
get him out of here.
what?
feds are requesting a million dollars bail. A million dollars?
well, he just moved here. He's a flight risk.
and trust me, it's a good thing. Why is that?
Vasquez family put a hit out on Mickey. You got to be kidding me.
I knew this was a terrible idea. They think he's talking to us.
well, obviously, he's not talking. You just heard for yourself.
well, they don't know that. And they wouldn't believe it if we told them.
we can't help this guy 'cause he won't talk, and they want to whack him 'cause they think he is?
I know. You know? That's all you got to offer- you know?
I want two marshals on him at all times.
if he goes to take a leak, I want one of them flushing the...
it's already being taken care of. If he gets whacked, it's on me.
then I'm gonna be on you.
over there.
those three.
why are we here, Frank?
one of the boy in the ball cap and the blue jacket. You see him?
I do.
two cell phones going- one for calls, the other for texts.
I don't think he runs a hedge fund.
there's no law against carrying two cell phones, Frank.
no, there isn't.
but you see the way he keeps shifting his weight and tapping his hip?
okay. So?
well, a loaded pistol weighs about two pounds.
these guys don't use holsters, so it's just kind of loose weight with only the elastic in his waistband or a skinny belt to secure it. So that man's carrying a gun?
my 30-plus years doing police work says yes.
he is carrying a gun and therefore likely to be involved in dealing drugs.
given the neighborhood, probably crack.
so what are we going to do about it?
nothing.
Frank, I got it.
lesson over. If he's carrying a gun, someone needs to stop him.
well, what if I'm wrong?
what if it's just a pint of vodka he keeps checking?
but you say your experience tells you it's a gun.
it does.
but I am not infallible.
and he is black.
if I'm wrong and stop him, I open myself up to a lawsuit.
but if somebody makes a call, then it gives the police just cause to stop and question him.
that's right.
but unless and until it does, no cop who cares about his pension will go near him.
we're done here.
your medicine working yet?
Aw, Gramps.
I'm either sending my buddy to jail or to his grave.
they don't make medicine strong enough to deal with that.
you didn't do anything but your job. Right.
Mickey brought this on himself.
so why do I feel like a piece of crap then?
cause you cared for him.
Yeah. Well, sometimes I think I should've been a firefighter.
you just learning this is a thankless job?
what now, Sutton?
Mickey just made bail. How the hell did he do that?
it wasn't him.
a Vasquez soldier posted it for him.
Vasquez family just bailed Mickey out.
there's only one reason they'd want to spring him.
careful.
Connie, where's Mickey? What do you want?
I need to talk to Mickey. He's in jail, where you put him.
come on. You and I both know they bailed him out, so knock it off.
so what if they did?
that's what friends do.
you think they're his friends. They're not, Connie.
they think he talked. He didn't tell you a thing.
I know that, but they don't.
if they bailed him out, it's 'cause they think he sang and they're gonna hurt him.
I...
Connie, look at me.
you know I'm not lying. Where is he?
I don't... I don't know where he is.
I honestly don't.
he texted me a while ago, but it's just gibberish.
I think he pocket-dialed me.
it's in ob.
taking me under the bridge. I...
I love you.
what? I got to... I got to go.
this is Detective Reagan.
I'm gonna need a 10-85 forthwith.
no, no, no! You got it wrong.
you got it wrong! No!
no. No.
don't do this.
you got it wrong. You guys got it wrong.
I didn't do anything!
I'm begging you. Don't do this.
police! Drop it!
one in the chamber.
drop the gun!
learn how to count.
come on.
come on.
get this piece of crap out of here.
this is what's gonna happen.
you're gonna make a change, you're gonna set things right and then, maybe then,
I'll consider calling you a friend again.
I got to testify. Yeah, you got to testify.
I'll be there the whole time making sure you don't screw it up like you screwed up everything else. And after that?
after that, you start a new life with Connie and the boys.
I want to say something, but "thank you" doesn't seem like enough.
it's not enough.
come on.
let's go.
come on.
Ten-hut!
at ease.
there's a lot of talk around this precinct and throughout the department about Stop, Question and Frisk.
many of you believe that the judge's ruling is unfair, even dangerous.
here is my take on the ruling.
it is the law.
and because it is the law, we damn sure are gonna see that it is carried out.
now, I know that's not what many of you want to hear.
and that's fine.
you have a right to your opinion when you are off duty.
but when you come through those doors and you put on that uniform, best check those opinions in your locker.
the real truth about Stop, Question, and Frisk is that it is a highly effective measure.
and it has helped us take a whole lot of bad guys off the street.
but it is not the only tool on your belt.
and it is not something we are discarding altogether.
and I can tell you that the mayor gets that.
I need some help.
I need you to do the job you signed on to do.
I will give you clear guidelines so you can do that job.
and I will always have your back.
that is all.
Ten-hut!
when you were kids, did you know that Mr. Patrick was gonna turn out to be a criminal?
no, I didn't know that. We were just friends.
I knew. Oh, come on, Pop.
20/20 hindsight? Well, I did.
Mickey Patrick was a born felon.
come on, Gramps.
I didn't even how I was gonna turn out, much less anyone else.
none of us did.
you thought you might turn out sideways? No, I was an angel.
I'm talking about your Uncle Danny.
grandma always kept a little bail fund for Danny in a mayonnaise jar over the fridge.
no, she did not.
your dad was the type of guy that liked to know everyone else's moves before he decided on his own.
which is not a bad way to be, and handy for a cop.
Thanks.
if you can stop yourself from defining someone by their worst choices, you know, like your dad tries to do, then you'll be a better man.
I'm really loving this.
but if a guy commits a crime, isn't he a criminal?
for that act, yes. But that's not all he is.
uh, okay.
all right, Sean, what movie do we always watch this time of year?
a Christmas Carol. Okay, take Ebenezer Scrooge.
he starts out a decent fellow, then he gets cranky, then he gets downright mean, then he gets scared, and then he tries to bargain his way out, and then he ends up all jolly and generous.
so, Ebenezer Scrooge, good guy or bad guy?
good?
but he is bad through most of the story.
I say bad.
Yeah, and when you call someone a Scrooge, it means that they're cheap in a mean sort of way.
that's right. Yeah, but...
when you watch the movie, you end up liking him in the end.
also right. What you take away is up to you, makes you who you are in terms of how you look at other people.
and there was no bail fund.
you remember that envelope full of cash that Mom gave you on your 21st birthday?
Yeah. Had a couple hundred bucks in it. Bail fund.
no, no, no. Mom told me it was docked allowance from over the years.
yeah? Yes.
no. Bail fund.
it's supposed to be a good school.
Yeah, parents pumped a lot of money into it.
you know the place? - Caught a case here a while back.
what do we got? - Ten-year-old female, Jenna Wallace.
never made it home from school.
parents over there reported her missing an hour ago. - Any witnesses?
crossing guard saw the girl leave the building.
ma'am, can you tell us what you saw?
uh, Jenna had just crossed the street, um, a white car pulled up, a two-door compact sedan, - um, she got in, they took off. - Did you get a look at the driver?
no. I didn't catch the license plate either.
does Jenna usually get picked up from school? - No, tha-tha-that's the thing...
she walks home every day with her friend Stacy. Really nice kids.
no signs of struggle, huh? - No. The way she got in the car, it seemed like she knew the driver.
I keep thinking I should've done something. - You've been very helpful, thank you.
I got a bad feeling about this one.
at least we got the make and model of the car. - Yeah.
excuse us. Detective Reagan.
this is Detective Baez. - You need to find Jenna.
you need to bring her back to us. - We're gonna do everything we can.
we'd like for you two to come down to the squad room so we can ask you some questions.
the more information we get, the better chances are we can get your daughter back.
please, you need to find my baby. - We'll do all we can, all right?
get them down to squad, all right?
Yes, sir.
start plastering this neighborhood with "information wanted" posters.
I'll let Gormley know we need the whole squad on this.
we got about 72 hours to find this girl or chances are we never will.
ms. Del Rio ran down the superintendent in the parking garage of her building.
I understand the allegations against Ms. Del Rio.
we have an eyewitness.
elderly lady and the lighting was not great, I know that.
I'm so sorry I hurt Mr. Romanelli. I- I'm sorry.
you put Mr. Romanelli in the morgue, ma'am.
that said, in the absence of concrete proof that you intended to kill the victim,
I am prepared to offer a plea of manslaughter.
that's generous... in the normal course of events.
but not in this case, no, thank you.
I think you should confer with your client first. The evidence is overwhelming.
ms. Del Rio suffers from, uh, severe bipolar illness.
and she was in a manic state at the time of the accident...
you're pleading not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.
that is very difficult to prove.
exactly... but that's why they pay me the big bucks.
I understand.
thanks for the call. That was Scotland Yard.
please don't tell me we're going on another goodwill trip to London.
that rain's murder on my sciatica.
there is not a lot of goodwill flowing at the moment.
they've detained one of our intelligence officers, - Detective Paul Hailey. - On what charge?
there was a terrorist bombing at a West End tube station. - I know that.
hailey is being accused of entering the scene and handling evidence - without authorization. - He's doing his job.
Yeah! He found the cause of the blast and reported his findings.
What'd he find?
that's all I can tell you.
that's all you can tell me or all you will tell me?
I can't handle this if I don't know what's going on! - There's nothing to handle.
you know there will be.
Garrett, you are my deputy commissioner of public information.
this is private information.
so, what do we got on your end? - We're canvassing the neighborhood, checking all the surveillance cameras near the school, - running all vehicles matching the description registered in the area. - Good.
I'll get TARU to download their content from the past few days... - Sounds like a plan.
I'm running all recent parolees. - Here you go, Reagan.
thank you. Checking the sex offender registry see if there's any twists living in the neighborhood.
Hey, Detective.
Mr. Scott...
my new partner, Maria Baez.
Joseph. Good to meet you.
so, you heard, it's happened again. - Yeah, I heard.
uh... we caught the case in fact.
that's great. It's the same school.
it's the same time of day. - Am I missing something?
Joseph's daughter Allie was abducted from the same school seven years ago.
seven years, two months, 14 days.
Danny worked 'round the clock to find Allie.
he puts up with me... coming by, chewing his ear, giving him updates.
Yeah, unfortunately, I wasn't able to bring Allie back to you.
but this is a big break, right?
I mean, whoever took this girl, maybe they know something about my Allie.
you know, we kind of went over this before.
the odds of finding somebody after all this time... - I know the statistics.
I also know in my heart that Allie's out there somewhere.
she has to be.
don't give up on her, Danny.
this a recent picture of Jenna?
it's her school photo. They took it last month.
do you know if she's had any, uh, incidents lately, fights, arguments with anyone?
no...
she's a sweet girl.
the crossing guard said it looked like Jenna might have known the driver who picked her up.
that's not possible. - All right.
we need you to write down any adults your daughter might have come in contact with, okay?
coaches, crossing guards, teachers, counselors, whatever you can think of, okay?
nobody we know would do something like that. - With all due respect, you don't know that.
there's a lot of bad people out there.
Hey, you should go easy with these people. - I told them the truth.
they are scared enough without hearing about what people are capable of, Danny.
I'm not gonna lie to them.
there's a good chance this is gonna go bad, okay? So they should be prepared for that.
and if that happens we'll deal with it, but for now, hope is all these people have.
right, like Joseph Scott?
that case was seven years ago and you did everything that you could.
I told that guy to have hope. Now look at him. He can't move on with his life.
it's like he walks around with that look on his face like he's in a bad movie.
I'm not gonna do that to these people.
so, in addition to your private practice, you lecture at Columbia?
I'm a professor of law and psychiatry.
well, Amanda Harris speaks very highly of you.
I've testified for her many times over the years. Never lost a case.
obviously the case against Ms. Del Rio hinges on her mental state at the time of the incident.
bipolar illness is a serious disorder, but in my experience defense attorneys tend to exaggerate the severity of their clients' symptoms to keep them out of jail.
well, in this case, defense counsel is particularly aggressive and he does his homework.
I'm confident I can handle anything the defense throws my way.
great. I'll have the file sent over to your office and arrange for you to interview the defendant.
don't worry, Ms. Reagan.
I've never let this office down. I don't intend to start now.
I think it's all just a misunderstanding, Mr. Mayor.
nothing for you to worry about. Nothing I can't handle.
no, sir.
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, I have to go.
I have a meeting. No, sir, it's not about this.
it's just a ceremonial nuisance.
you'll be the first to know.
FBI Assistant Director Tomasetti's here.
let's have him.
we got a hell of a situation here, Frank.
Oh, I don't know why. There's no evidence my officer did anything wrong.
the Brits are threatening to kick all U. S. intelligence personnel out of the country.
well, we both know that's not gonna happen, Jason.
they're just pissed off. - I can't say I blame them.
we had agents on scene.
you have officers on the Joint Terrorist Task Force.
you would've been briefed on any relevant terrorist threat.
I'm responsible for protecting the number one terrorist target in the world.
so you'll understand if I choose to decide what is and isn't a relevant threat.
no other U. S. city maintains its own independent intelligence force.
no other city lost 3, 000 people to terrorism.
homeland Security has their hands full.
a vast number of security priorities.
I have one...
keeping my city safe. End of discussion.
you can expect a call from the director. - Happy to take it.
I'm home.
I got souvlaki from Grammatico's.
I thought you were stopping by Grandpa's tonight. - That's tomorrow.
is everything okay?
Yeah, I was just studying.
Hey, I'm Ben.
Hi, I'm Nicky's mom. - Ben's in my physics class.
we've got a unit exam tomorrow, so...
you usually study at the dining room table.
I should go.
don't. Stay for dinner.
it's okay. Right, Mom?
Yeah.
great.
let's eat.
here you go. - Is Jenna gonna be okay?
uh, we're trying really hard to find her, Stacy.
so you two walk home together every day? - We live in the same building.
what happened today? Why didn't you walk home today?
we left school like we usually do, but she left her art project in school.
I couldn't wait 'cause I had a violin lesson.
okay. - I should have waited.
no. It's not your fault. - I mean...
I told her to just bring the art project home tomorrow, but she said her stepfather would be mad.
her st... Mr. Wallace is her stepfather?
Yeah. But they don't really get along.
he has a really bad temper and he's always yelling at Jenna and punishing her for no reason.
okay. Okay. Well, thank you for bringing her in.
if we need anything else, we'll be in touch, okay? And thank you for your help.
I'll run a triple-I on Mark Wallace.
check for any domestic incidents or complaints from their address, all right?
like I said, there are a lot of bad people out there.
turns out Mark Wallace was married once before.
got arrested five years ago on a domestic for pushing around his first wife.
he's got a history of violence? - I spoke to the ex.
she said, when he was slapping her around, they were fighting about kids.
how many kids they have?
none. Wallace never wanted to have any.
thought that they would get in the way or ruin their relationship.
if he didn't want kids, why'd he go marry somebody else who had a kid?
probably thought he could deal with it. - Guess he thought wrong.
Dr. Raskin, in your expert opinion, was the defendant responsible for her actions on the day of the incident?
after studying Ms. Del Rio's medical history and examining her directly, it's my opinion that the effects of her bipolar illness were insufficient to cause such a violent outburst.
thank you, Doctor.
may it please the court.
Dr. Raskin, my client's medical history comprises more than 3, 000 pages right here.
and you've had it for less than 48 hours.
how much of it did you actually read?
enough to draw a reasoned opinion.
so you read the section about her time at the Rowe Psychiatric Hospital?
no.
that's over half the file, Doctor.
and was the 12-minute session that you had with my client enough for you to draw a reasoned conclusion?
that's not a lot of time, Dr. Raskin, 12 minutes?
I've been in clinical practice for 26 years.
I've treated scores of bipolar patients.
then you must know that no two cases of bipolar illness are the same.
Yes. I also know that your client's statement to police exhibited little sign of delusional thinking, which one would expect had she been delusional during the incident.
do you think mental illness can ever cause someone to commit a crime?
Yes, just not in this case.
and that's based on your so-called thorough examination of my client and your partial perusal of her medical history, right, sir?
no further questions, Your Honor.
inspector General Peterson, the commissioner is expecting you.
thank you.
angela Merkel's cell phone.
what?
the NSA tapped the German chancellor's private cell phone.
I'm sure they had their good reasons for it, but I'm also sure you can't find anyone outside the NSA who thinks it's a good policy.
this is not that. - Then tell me what this is.
a detective from our International Liaison Program was accused of tampering with a crime scene, but he was not in fact tampering.
he was just doing his very important job.
says you.
that's right.
we need to know what's out there before it comes here.
and who besides you knows the full inner workings of the program?
I consult with the mayor and my deputy commissioners when it is appropriate.
which, I'm guessing, is never.
it is not on our published schedules, but it is not never.
even the FBI and the CIA are subject to congressional oversight.
that's their problem.
Frank, it's my job to make sure the public understands what the NYPD is doing in its name.
not in this instance.
you're gonna have to do better than that.
the ILP works because the information is tightly controlled.
there are no leaks. And it's gonna stay that way.
but I can assure you we do not have a wire up on the German chancellor.
you think that I kidnapped Jenna?
that's not what I said. I'm just covering all my bases here.
want you to tell me about you and Jenna's relationship, okay?
I'm sure it's got to be hard being a stepparent and all. - Tell me about it.
I mean, you have no real power over them, and believe me, they know it. - Right.
so you two probably got into it. - Sure.
but it was nothing out of the ordinary.
look, I would never hurt Jenna, okay? Never.
or course not.
though you did have an incident with your ex-wife a few years ago.
all right, that was a misunderstanding.
okay. Incident report says you shoved her against a wall causing bodily harm.
she says it's 'cause you didn't want kids.
it was a little more complicated than that, all right?
look, Ellen had a drinking problem, okay?
I was halfway out the door when it happened.
it's okay.
you're a drug rep, it says here. That's what you do for work?
Yes. I was, uh, picking up some samples in Connecticut.
I was on my way home when I heard about Jenna.
right, the warehouse said you signed for a package at 12: 40 p. m.
and you headed straight back to the city?
no, no. I did some errands. Didn't get back till after 4: 00.
got it.
we ran a check on your company rental car.
a white sedan. Just like the one that picked up Jenna from school.
you never said anything to me about a white sedan, Mark.
I didn't do anything!
okay, for Jenna's sake, I think we're gonna have to go over this one more time from the top just to be safe.
I told you there's nothing to worry about.
defense did score points when they showed that you had not read the entire psychiatric history.
I've testified dozens of times.
jurors don't expect you to memorize a 3, 000-page document.
they may expect you to spend more than 12 minutes with the defendant in order to render a credible opinion about her condition.
I can assure you my clinical assessment is perfectly valid.
I did read Ms. Del Rio's file.
she has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for years.
she assaulted a nurse two years ago. - You know what? I'm sorry.
are you a prosecutor or a psychiatrist?
I'm just saying, isn't it...? - No, whatever you're saying,
ms. Reagan, has zero scientific value.
I wrote the book on these disorders, literally.
you hired me to render my professional opinion.
if you wish to undermine my conclusions and your case...
go with God.
I checked Wallace's EZ Pass.
And?
he went through the Whitestone Bridge toll plaza at 1537 hours, 20 minutes after Jenna was abducted.
great, so unless he's driving a rocket ship, he's not our guy.
I'm gonna go grab us some coffee.
ay, ay, ay.
what's this? - My file on Allie.
all my notes, personal investigator reports. I thought it might help.
I guess, at this point, it can't hurt.
I gather the investigation isn't going well?
we're looking into every angle. We're just coming up empty so far.
on the day Allie was taken, you told me, "The best weapon in a case like this is never lose hope.
I said that, didn't I? - You did your best for me.
and for Allie.
and now these parents need you to do the same for them.
how do you do it, Joseph?
you never lose hope.
no matter how many years pass, you keep hoping everything's gonna be okay.
how do you do it?
because I don't have a choice.
the alternative is accepting that my life is over.
that I've lost the one thing I love most in this world.
there's noise out there the inspector general may call for hearings on the Liaison Program.
I know that.
I'd love to help you out, but I've got one hand tied behind my back.
one will have to be sufficient. - She's got to be bluffing.
don't bet on it.
she can't dictate department policy to the PC. - That's the beauty of it.
she's not dictating policy, she's simply calling for transparency in an existing program.
one that has to be as transparent as a rock to work.
so let's counter. - Let's not.
you don't want to make your case?
to make a case you have to offer details, strategies, viability.
not gonna.
well, you're not gonna pretend it doesn't exist either.
that ship sailed. - I will not discuss the program, Garrett!
not in a press release and not before a committee.
so how exactly do you expect me to handle the press?
with a polite but firm "No comment.
and what, wait for it to go away? That's the plan?
the inspector general can investigate anything she wants.
doesn't mean I have to start singing. - What if she subpoenas you?
I won't testify.
there's a problem.
you refuse a subpoena, she can drag you into court.
and if you still don't cooperate, into a jail cell.
I know that, too.
last time we were here, you told us this is where Jenna came to pick up her art.
that's right. Jenna spent a lot of time here.
and you said there was no one working in the room the day Jenna disappeared?
the art teacher left early.
the room was open so the kids could stop in. Mrs. Galecki locked up.
who's Mrs. Galecki? - One of our custodians.
that's her over there.
Thanks.
ms. Galecki?
can I help you folks? - Yeah. Police.
uh, we're here investigating the disappearance of Jenna Wallace.
Oh, that poor girl. - Yes, ma'am.
did you see her when she came in here that afternoon?
Yeah. She was always down here.
she made this beautiful mural...
little trees and a pond made out of shiny blue paper.
first place in the art fair.
do you know if she was with anyone?
no. She just grabbed her project and headed out.
those are beautiful.
I make these myself.
I sell 'em at, uh, flea markets and craft fairs. Every little bit helps.
you keep this.
it's on the house.
thanks for your time.
arugula salad from the salad guy?
Caesar's from Carl's Cafe. It's nirvana.
I got a call from Malcolm Raskin's office.
let me guess.
he didn't nominate me as prosecutor of the year. - That's an understatement.
he said you questioned his professional judgment.
that's not true. I questioned his work ethic, and then I questioned his professional judgment.
Raskin's one of the top guys in his field. - Yeah.
he made that abundantly clear. - Okay, so Malcolm has an ego.
but he's a great doctor and he's a great witness.
I've read the transcript. His testimony can help you win the case.
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
raskin skimmed the defendant's medical history, and then he did a flyby on the psych exam.
you know as well as I do that defendants have been crying crazy - since the advent of jurisprudence. - That's true.
but every once in a while, one of them is telling the truth.
I reviewed her history.
del Rio might be that defendant.
did you check the pork chops?
Yeah, they need a few more minutes.
Ben seems like a nice guy.
he is.
you want me to finish up that salad? - Yeah, that would be great.
how'd you do on the test? - Pretty well, I think.
studying with Ben really helped. We make a really great team.
well, that's... great. Have you known him a while?
we have a bunch of friends in common.
this is the first class we've actually had together.
I guess I was a little surprised the other night because...
well, you know, you've never really mentioned him before.
I'm sure you've got a lot of friends you've never mentioned to me, right?
well, yeah...
Oh, mashed potatoes are ready. - So, then... you're saying Ben is just a friend?
actually, I never said "just'."
so, Sean, you get to spend an overnight in Philadelphia?
Yeah. Jimmy's dad's bringing me, Terrence and Andrew to see the Knicks play the Sixers.
I hate the damn Sixers. - His company has an apartment down there.
Wow. - I know, right?
I never got to do anything like that when I was his age.
Oh, Jack... - Bitter, party of one...
actually, Sean, I don't think it's gonna work out for you.
why not? - 'Cause I haven't met Jimmy's dad.
we talked about this when we said he could go, Danny.
I know we talked about it and I gave it some more thought and I think I should take him to the Garden myself. You can bring your friends.
but that's not fair. - Yeah.
I mean, you said he could go.
what's... - Pop...
your dad's just trying to take care of you, Sean. - That's a parent's job.
but at some point, people have the right to have their own life.
is this because of the case you're working on?
the girl who disappeared?
Sean... - No. It's 'cause I'm your father.
can you pass the applesauce?
protecting people can be complicated, Sean.
sometimes people don't appreciate the way you try to keep them safe.
until something goes wrong. - Exactly.
but shouldn't people have control over the way they live their lives?
we got a lot of freedom in this country, but there's got to be some rules, laws to protect us.
sometimes from ourselves.
maybe sometimes you should let people take care of themselves.
Yeah, well, not everyone can do that, Nicky.
there's a lot of bad people out there. - And they can do a lot of damage.
still, I see what Nicky's saying. I mean, there's a fine line between protecting people and going too far...
trampling on their rights. - I'm definitely feeling trampled.
the people with the responsibility need to use it as wisely as they can.
and the people being protected need to realize that being safe can cost you something.
but it beats the hell out of the alternative.
I assume we're not here to take in a matinee.
this is for your ears only.
five months ago an Islamist terror cell
same one responsible for the bombing in London the other day had plans to do some damage here.
what happened?
on a tip, we located the bomb components in a locker at Penn Station.
that tip was provided by one of my officers in the International Liaison Program.
FBI didn't have the intel, or Interpol, or the CIA.
only we did. - Listen, I'm just trying to...
I know what you're trying to do.
but in this instance, it's a dead wrong reading of the public's right to know.
well, you're out of bounds with that. You're not the judge here.
no, I'm not.
and neither are you.
the judgment comes if there's something we miss and innocent people die.
I wish it were that simple.
it is. - It is not.
Kelly, this can't be effectively run with backseat drivers and armchair quarterbacks.
it just can't.
that's not what I'm after.
walks like it, talks like it.
after the incident in London, all eyes are on your ILP.
this is the Snowden era.
hell, even the NSA let 60 Minutes in their front door.
maybe, but they didn't let 'em in the kitchen where the sausage is made.
you've got a job to do.
you do it well and I respect that.
but I've got a job, too.
I'm charged with monitoring the NYPD and making sure they're operating in the public interest.
the public interest would not be served by killing the ILP.
and open hearings would do just that.
you can push this only so far until anyone in their right mind is gonna think, "What the hell are they hiding?
joseph Scott's file? - Yeah.
figured maybe I could find something that we could use.
we've checked out everyone who works at that school.
they're all clean.
Yeah. We're missing something.
you're just torturing yourself 'cause you couldn't find Allie Scott - and now you think it's happening again. - I'm doing my job, okay?
my son was in the hospital before.
we didn't know if he was gonna make it.
something like that happens...
there's nothing else in the world that feels that way.
it's like your heart is being ripped out of your chest.
nothing makes sense.
that's what Joseph Scott feels like every day.
and you don't want the Wallaces to end up the same.
no, I don't.
well, did you find anything in the file?
the girls have a couple things in common.
they both sang in the school choir, they both won prizes in the art fair.
look at that.
the flower.
just like the one the custodian gave you.
look.
it looks the same.
that custodian, Ms. Galecki... she was the last one that saw Allie at the school seven years ago.
custodian's office is right across from the art class where Jenna went back in before she was abducted.
so Galecki saw Jenna every day, too.
it's still kind of a leap. - What else do we got?
let's take a ride.
come on.
thank you for coming, Doctor. - I hope this won't take long.
I have patients this afternoon. - I spoke with Amanda Harris.
I understand you're quite upset with me.
let's just say I accept your apology and move on.
this is not an apology. It's quite the contrary.
I asked two psychiatrists, who have testified for this office in the past, to review Ms. Del Rio's file and to meet with her.
both concluded that her bipolar illness was responsible for the incident, directly contradicting your testimony.
this is outrageous. - I agree.
an expert witness more interested in satisfying his ego than telling the truth is outrageous.
I don't have to take this.
I kept asking myself, "I wonder why is he doing this?
I mean, you clearly do not need the money.
and then it occurred to me.
it's a game for you.
you like to walk in and have everyone see how smart you are.
to have the jury hang on every word. - My credentials speak for themselves.
if you don't appreciate my expertise, - there are scores of your colleagues who will. - Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.
I intend to get justice in this case.
the fact that I had to go around my own expert witness to do so will be known by every prosecutor in this building.
I would not wait by the phone.
ms. Galecki, it's Detective Reagan.
can you open the door, please?
Hello, Detectives. - Ma'am.
is everything all right?
we need to ask you some questions. Can we step inside, please?
well, I'm sorry. Is it okay if we talk out here?
my husband isn't well. - With all due respect, we're dealing with a missing child, ma'am.
we'll get a warrant to search the place if we need to.
no need to do that. Come in.
how can I help you? - Where's your husband, ma'am?
he's sleeping upstairs.
upstairs, huh?
okay.
you working on your flowers today, ma'am?
but, Detective, where are you going? - Just looking around, ma'am.
that the basement? - Yes.
what's down there?
just storage and supplies.
my husband has a key. - Step aside, ma'am.
thank you.
Hello?
police. Anyone down there?
Hello!
help me, please!
grab her.
ma'am, I need you to stay right here.
don't move.
Hello?
get your damn hands off her right now.
she's okay. - Let her go.
everything is okay. - Shut your mouth and let her go now.
stay right here.
I'm Detective Reagan; I'm gonna get you home safe now.
I got her!
put your hands behind your back, please.
on the ground, you. - Hey, take it easy.
shut your mouth and get on the ground.
we never hurt her. - Now!
detective Reagan? - It's okay, sweetie. I'll get you out of here in a second.
detective Reagan?
not guilty by reason of insanity.
are you sure?
del Rio will be committed to a secure psychiatric facility - where she can get the help that she needs. - It hasn't helped so far.
if you let this go to jury on the murder charge with Malcolm's testimony, you would probably win.
it depends on your definition of winning.
it's where she belongs, Amanda.
thank you.
I'm hearing we can expect a subpoena by the end of the week.
I guess I could always leave town.
I'd buy you a fake mustache and glasses, but you've got that covered.
remind me again why I keep you around.
force of habit?
the inspector general is here.
let's have her.
you have to admire a woman who serves her own subpoenas.
what was that look? - I didn't give you a look.
Yeah, you did.
it's like the look the first wife gives the second wife at the kid's graduation ceremony.
interloper.
exactly.
I've got work to do.
you're going to refuse to testify.
Yes.
do you really believe that I want to endanger this city?
I never said that.
but there is an immutable truth about intelligence.
it's a lot less valuable if your enemies know you have it.
Kelly, I won't discuss the program publicly.
well, maybe you won't have to.
I'd like to propose monthly briefings with the city councilman who oversees the NYPD.
that's not gonna happen.
there has to be an individual outside the department with access to this program.
that would be you.
well...
I can't very well go back to them and just nominate myself.
it is the only offer on the table.
I can't promise anything.
didn't ask you to.
I've got a question.
would you really put me in jail?
Yes.
but with a heavy heart.
good night, Ms. Reagan.
Bye, Ben.
so, I'll see you tomorrow.
see you.
just ask me, Mom.
what?
ask me if I'm having sex with Ben.
are you?
no.
but we have talked about it.
Oh?
come on, Mom, you can't really be surprised.
most of my friends have already done it.
that is not a good enough reason to have sex for the first time.
do you love him?
I don't know.
I mean, he's a really great guy, and I really care about him.
and I feel like I'm ready.
go ahead, let me have it.
okay.
well, I am sorry to disappoint you, but I am not going to yell and scream.
do I wish that you would wait until you were sure if you were in love?
Yes.
but we both know that's not up to me.
you are a beautiful, smart young woman with good judgment.
when the time is right, you will make the right decision.
and if you need to talk about anything, I am here.
thank you.
now, having said that, this is still my house, which means there are boundaries. I do not want you two in that bedroom, and let's keep the PDA down to a minimum.
deal?
deal.
deal.
did you and Grandma ever have this conversation?
Yes.
the day before I was going to marry your father, and...
I didn't have the heart to tell her that she was a little late.
detective?
Hey, Joseph, thanks for coming down.
I heard you found Jenna Wallace.
uh, yeah, thanks to you.
I'm happy for them.
they're grateful to you for all you did.
there's someone else who wants to thank you, too, right over there.
daddy?
daddy?
did they...?
no.
she said they never touched her.
isn't this place charming?
as advertised, but you didn't invite me here for the charm - or the ice cream. - We can't just have ice cream?
we can, but not in this instance.
better chance of being hit by lightning.
okay, I have a problem.
well, first of all, your mom's got a lot on her plate. and I think she's doing an outstanding job considering...
it's not about Mom.
it's about my teacher.
it's like she's made it her mission in life to keep me from ever graduating.
turn that thing off. - But what if it's important?
choose.
look, here's the problem.
she's notorious for being harder on the girls, but when she found out I was from a family of cops...
look, I should really check it. - Choose.
grandpa... - How would you feel if I was constantly interrupting?
deputy Commissioner Moore just walked in.
hold that thought.
a cop's been shot.
who and where?
north End bus yard, multiple precincts rolled, but radio chatter's not clear on a name, how bad they're hit.
we've got conflicting descriptions of perps and direction of flight.
tell me something we do know.
whoever's down is a detective out of Danny's precinct.
this is Detective Reagan.
leave a message.
Hey, Danny, it's me, give me a call. Let me know everything's okay.
Hey, voice mail again?
Yeah, third time. You heard anything new?
lady called 911, said she was out walking her dog, heard yelling from behind a fence.
someone being accused of being a cop. Shots fired.
there's still no name? - Only that he was rushed to St. Benjamin's.
a couple of guys are headed over.
all right, I'm gonna ask the boss if we can, too, just in case, all right? - Okay, come on, there's got to be 15 detectives in the 5-4 squad.
odds are it isn't your brother.
Danny's wife. - No way she's heard anything.
unless she got the call.
Hey, Linda. - Jamie, it's not Danny.
he called you?
Yeah, in case I heard, but he's fine. He's working a case in Murray Hill, and he said he was gonna call your dad as soon as he hung up with me.
thank God. - Yeah, no kidding.
listen...
Hi, Mom! - Awesome!
Yeah, I'm picking the boys up right now, so could you call Erin and Henry?
you know, make sure they're not worried too. - Yeah, they already are.
Thanks, Linda.
I'm glad it wasn't Danny. There, I said it.
I felt the same way. Danny's family.
steve Tomlin has one, too.
let's hope for the best.
Dino says Steve has been undercover for the last year, working his way up the chain of a drug operation run by Santo Castillo.
somebody made him.
word is, after Castillo shot him, Steve managed to put a slug in Castillo, who ran off.
tough cop.
gave him the Combat Cross in '09.
commissioner?
how's my officer?
um, I'm afraid he's gone. Three bullets, one through the carotid.
he lost too much blood by the time he arrived.
thank you, Doctor.
I'll need to talk to his wife.
Lorraine. Married to Steve for 22 years, tax accountant by trade.
they have a home in Staten Island.
Frank, she's here.
two daughters, Bella and Lucy, both in college.
Mrs. Tomlin?
I'm so sorry.
can I arrange to get Lucy and Bella home from school?
Oh, that, uh...
uh, yes.
um, thank you.
my department owes Steve a deep debt of gratitude for his years of service.
anything we can do to help, you only need to ask.
catch whoever murdered my husband.
we will do that.
tell me we got the son of a bitch.
wish I could. - That's not the answer I want to hear, Dino.
Yes, sir. Morning, Baker.
morning, sir.
Castillo was shot. That would've slowed him down.
he hasn't turned up in any E. R. in the three-state. I've got the whole department out looking.
half of them are doing it on their own time. - Who'd you put with the family?
johnson and Garcia. They came up in the ranks together. - And on the case?
sergeant Gormley said he gave it to the best detective he's got.
on the ground! Get on the ground!
move it!
back away from that sink!
on the ground now!
turn around, get on the ground, put your hands behind your head!
Where's your boss? - Who?
you heard me. Castillo. - Yo, we're just cleaning crew.
yeah?
my cleaning lady keeps a bazooka, too.
still enough here to send you down the drain.
what's your name? - Ticky.
Ticky, you want a break? Give up the cop killer.
like he said, we don't know anything.
fine, you want to play stupid with me, get your hands up on the sink.
move! I got all the time in the world till you decide to wise up.
as far as I'm concerned, each one of you pulled the trigger on Steve Tomlin.
you're all coming for a ride, let's go.
get them out of here.
Erin, that was impressive.
well, sometimes when you get the right witness, the whole case will fall into place.
well, I'll get her statement typed up and to the DA by lunch. - Great.
can you find the car? - Lady, can you give me some help?
sorry, I don't have any change.
I mean a different kind of help. - Tyler?
what? - Tyler Jeffries. I'm Nicky's mom.
uh, my name's not Tyler. - From Blessed Heart.
you came to our house for Nicky's birthday party - last year. - I said I'm not him.
forget it. - Tyler, are you okay?
here we go, Erin. - Yeah, I'll be right there.
put him in interrogation.
this one in the radio room. Cuff the others to something solid.
don't let them talk to each other or so much as trade glances.
this goes real easy, fellas.
first one to give up Castillo wins the prize.
you get the radio room. I got the box. - Got it.
reagan, you want help?
no. - I got cops from a dozen precincts volunteering to turn the screws on these guys.
no, we're gonna get a crack at them first.
all right, listen, Steve kept me in the loop on this Castillo.
says his people are unusually loyal.
boss of the year? Great, I'm jealous.
well, I'm just saying, you might hit a brick wall.
then I'll drag his family in here.
if you can find them. Apparently he has a sister, but Castillo made her change her name so nobody could find her and use her against him in some way.
do you have any more words of encouragement here, Sarge, cause this level of optimism is really firing me up.
all right, just-just holler if you need help, all right?
if you hear any hollering, it won't be me. Open it up.
what are you doing?
homework. - Without being asked?
who are you and what have you done with my daughter?
how was your day?
weird.
you know that boy from your class, Tyler Jeffries?
Yeah. - What's his story?
funny.
super nice. He's not in my class anymore, though.
he and his mom moved, like five months ago.
I guess Tyler was getting high and stuff, so his mom put him in boarding school upstate to straighten him out.
well, I don't think it worked. - What do you mean?
I ran into him today in Hell's Kitchen, and he looked messed up on drugs or homeless or both.
what? - Yeah, it took me a second to even recognize him.
Oh, my God.
but you helped him, right? - Well, he ran off before I could.
then we got to go find him.
well, I will call Child Services, and they will contact his mother.
come on, can we just go look for him?
relax, all right? I will handle it.
get him out of my face.
nothing? - Nothing.
none of my guys even so much as asked for a lawyer.
they just sat there smirking at me.
you? - Same.
so what's next? - Pot of coffee.
Yeah, I'll go make one. - Thanks.
how's it going?
don't ask. - Okay, so you want to give me a hand?
I'm kind of busy here, Sarge.
I need a witness to open Steve Tomlin's locker, collect his effects to give to his family.
okay, I'll get a box.
I always hate this more than the funeral.
a life interrupted and all. - Well, at least there's no bagpipes.
they always make me cry.
it's empty.
I talked to Steve yesterday before he started his tour, Sarge.
his locker was open and it was full.
his uniform was in there, there were papers everywhere and pictures.
somebody must've cleaned it out after he died. - But before we could find it.
who the hell's hiding what?
the number of cops lost in the line of duty since you've been on the job.
and now 23 since sitting behind this desk.
you want me to do a draft of your remarks for the service?
you ask me every time, Garrett. - And I'm gonna keep asking.
some things you can't delegate, even a piece of.
but you could take a look at it when I'm done.
not yet. Last night Sergeant Gormley went to collect Steve Tomlin's things, but somebody got there first. Locker was completely empty.
someone sanitized it.
and no way was it a civilian just waltzing in off the street.
I don't get it.
what's the big deal about a guy's locker? - What's in it. Or isn't.
any evidence of tampering goes right up the chain of command.
what, you think Castillo's got a mole in the 5-4? - That's the bad version.
I got a worse one: someone's covering for Tomlin.
we got a problem, Chief. - You sure this is a "we," Frank?
wouldn't it be better and quieter if the department dealt with this on the precinct level?
no.
thanks for coming, Uncle Jamie.
everything okay? Your text said it was "serious.
Yeah, it's about a friend of mine. - A friend?
no, really, he's a great kid. Name's Tyler.
he went to my school, but Mom said she saw him in Hell's Kitchen - looking like he was on drugs. - Did he use when you knew him?
I know he smoked pot sometimes.
no, I don't. But if I did, and it'd help find Tyler, then I'd admit it.
so you want me to look for him. - Could you?
mom said it was around 35th and 10th.
that's a pretty sketchy area. - Yeah, I know.
here, that's what he looks like.
your mom know you want me to do this?
Yeah, she's really worried, too.
she would've been here, but she wanted to go talk to Child Services about him.
all right, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, Uncle Jamie.
and this isn't just me saying it.
this comes straight from the commissioner:
someone in the 5-4 cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker without authorization...
or knows who did.
which may very well be impeding the murder investigation of a brother in blue to each and every one of you. So let me be clear.
if Detective Tomlin's belongings don't end up "in my office by 2400 hours, there'll be hell to pay. For all of us.
so, folks, while the rest of us get back to finding this son of a bitch Castillo, one of you is gonna stand up and do the right thing.
you owe it to Steve.
that's all.
and you two, you got some data to dig through, so get to it.
so, who do you think it is?
I don't want to believe anybody in this room could be capable of being Castillo's mole.
well, he found out Tomlin was undercover somehow.
well, maybe we'll get lucky and find it in all this data we gotta look through.
well, looks like Taru found a bunch of steamy text messages from one of our thug's cell phones.
which thug?
said it belonged to Ticky, the one who was dumping the coke earlier.
I grilled him. He didn't say squat.
well, it looks like he had a lot to say when he was sexting this Vivian girl.
look who he says her brother is. - Castillo.
son of a bitch. - He was transported down to Central Booking.
let's get his ass back here now.
Ah, another day of crime-fighting.
we should get capes. - I should get a new partner.
so why did you ask the boss for this sector today?
a favor for my niece and sister.
a friend of Nicky's was in this area the other day looking kind of rough, so I said I'd look for him.
man, you do more for your family by 9: 00 a. m.
than my family's done for each other our entire lives.
name's Tyler Jeffries, about five-foot-eight, he's 16, - I still don't got nothing to say. - Why don't you relax, Ticky?
why do they even call you Ticky, anyway?
is it because you're a leech on a big fish like Santo Castillo, is that it?
I like watches.
which is appropriate since your time's running out, unless you tell us where to find your boss.
yo, like I told you before, I don't know who you're talking about.
Really? - Even though you're banging his sister... what is, uh, Vivian?
say what?
say you right here in these text messages.
"Vivian, you were incredible last night as always." To which she replied...
keep it on the DL, baby. My bro will kill us if he finds out.
to which you replied... "U kidding? Santo heart me."
and I could kick, I could kick his ass anyway.
that's a different Santo.
hmm. - Really? Even though Vivian wrote back...
Santo only hearts his money and his drugs.
"watch yourself." - To which you replied...
I only wanna watch u, baby.
Oh, smooth talker, I'll give him that. - Yeah.
Yeah. Let's just hope he's smooth enough to talk Santo out of blowing his brains out.
okay, okay! So I been hooking up with his sister.
great. Now you can tell us where she lives. - I can't tell you.
you know one big difference between you and I?
is that I'm not afraid of your boss, unlike you.
in fact, when I see him, I'm pretty much gonna tell him that you told us everything. In fact, maybe I'll even show him this lovely little picture that his sister sent to you.
please, look, if I give him up, he's gonna have me killed.
her, too.
which means we're the only ones who can protect you, as long as you start talking.
Yep, so why don't you tell us where she lives?
now!
police! Open up!
you can't just walk in here.
yeah? Well, this says we can. Step aside. Step aside!
see how easy that works?
let's go! - Don't touch me!
come on. Tear this place apart. Let's go.
you can't just do that, all right? I know my rights.
Where's your brother, Vivian? - I don't have one.
Santo Castillo, you're his sister.
Dolores, until he made you change your name to Vivian Vasquez.
what are you talking about? - Do you think we're stupid? He got shot up.
you're a nurse. Where else would he go?
maybe to his real sister, cause you got the wrong place.
so you all can kiss my ass! - Hey! Your brother's a cop killer.
and he's going down hard. And if you're harboring him, you're gonna go down just as hard, you understand?
and I ain't going nowhere cause I'm the only one here.
hands where I can see! - Is that right?
let me go! I didn't do nothing!
perp in custody! - You were saying?
come on, come on. He hid in the tub.
Yeah, real original.
hope you got clean, Castillo, 'cause that's the last shower you're gonna take by yourself for a long time.
Yeah, and if you think you're in a bad mood now, wait till you find out your sister's screwing the help.
what's he saying?
santo, I can explain. - You'll explain it to him later. Get him the hell out of here.
get him in the hallway.
take a look at 'em all, Castillo.
every cop in here wants to take a piece out of you. Open up.
I want my lawyer. - Won't do you any good. Next stop for you is a deep, dark hole.
Yeah, and on your way down, you can tell us who helped you set up Steve.
what?
your mole inside this precinct.
if that's what you think, you ain't never gonna figure out how I found out.
right.
giving up the cop who set up Steve is the only card you've got- tell your lawyer to play it.
let's go- I want to wash this dirtbag off my hands.
checking to see if Castillo's gonna give you up, Becker?
you're out of your mind. - What's your problem?
thought opening lockers was your specialty.
Steve's locker's right behind me.
that gives you plenty of opportunity to scope out his combination, or eavesdrop and see how close he's getting to Castillo.
listen, Detective...
the only thing I'm listening to, Becker, is you admit to it right now.
okay, fine, it was me.
I cleaned it out! - You Castillo's mole?
huh? - No, you got that wrong!
why'd you do it?!
Hey, beat it! Both of you, beat it now!
it's none of your damn business. - Start talking, Becker.
I just copped to it, Reagan.
but that's all I got to say.
and you understand the consequences of what you did?
possible grand larceny, possible criminal possession of stolen property, possible conspiracy in the murder of a police officer.
Yes, sir. - Yet you didn't ask for a lawyer or a union rep.
I don't need one, sir.
it was me who cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker.
on a cop killer's orders?
at ease.
sit down.
what you did doesn't square with your record.
come on, Bill.
I know you're sitting on something.
six years ago...
I was still on probation...
and me and my training officer heard this bank heist call go over the air.
steve was already on the scene when we got there, and all of a sudden, these robbers burst out, guns blazing...
and...
I froze. - I assume this is going somewhere.
steve pushed me out of the way before I got my head blown off...
and he took down both the perps.
he... He saved the day.
that night I bought all his drinks and... we became friends.
so you owed him?
what was he mixed up in?
steve was clean as a whistle, sir.
and this has nothing to do with the job.
then I know he wouldn't want you to blow up your career over this.
he has another family.
wait, so you saw Tyler?
Yeah. About a block down from where your mom saw him.
he was digging through a trash can. - Was he on drugs?
he didn't look good. - But, you took him home, right?
no. We never got the chance. He pushed Eddie pretty hard and then he ran.
we went after him, but... He was gone, just like that.
God. So, he's still out there? - Unfortunately, yeah, but I gave his photo to all the cars in the precinct and I'm gonna ask for the same assignment tomorrow, okay?
like hell you will. - Mom!
I was just telling Uncle Jamie about...
Yeah. I heard all about it. You sent him out looking?
just let me explain. - Wait. What?
I thought you said your mom knew about this?
would you both just listen to me?
look, I had to make sure Tyler got help before something bad happened.
so that justifies going behind my back?
and lying to me, Nicky? - I'm sorry.
but maybe if you didn't treat me like I'm still a little kid...
well, you just proved that you are, by ignoring me when I said I would take care of it.
so, did you? - I spoke to ACS, they've reached out to Tyler's mom, and I haven't heard back yet.
so now he's out there somewhere doing God knows what with God knows who.
the conversation's over.
if you don't eat your vegetables, no dessert.
delicious, as always.
you hardly ate.
I ate.
who made the potatoes? - Uh, I think it was Nicky.
better not say you didn't like them. - Loved them.
good and cheesy.
I'm surprised you found time to cook.
I managed. - Mm-hmm.
we missing something here?
feeling a little cold chill coming from this side of the table.
what's going on? - Nothing anyone needs to know about.
see, Francis? Hard enough having even one family some days.
boys, take your plates and go eat in the kitchen.
so you guys can have a conversation we're not supposed to hear?
that's exactly right, Jack. - Go on.
come on, I'll eat with you.
go easy on this, Pop. - I'm not going to pussyfoot around this.
what kind of cop has two families?
what? Who? The one that got killed?
Yeah. - Yeah, Steve Tomlin. He had a wife and two kids in Staten Island and a girlfriend with a newborn baby in Jersey.
and you didn't know?
steve is in your squad. - He was in my squad and I'm friendly with him, but pretty much nobody knew what was going on with him.
well, you know what, one of those women knew what was going on, - and it was probably the girlfriend. - So she doesn't deserve any sympathy?
he's the father of her kid. - No, that's not what I'm saying, Jamie.
maybe he was that good of a catch that they were happy to share him.
I personally just try to figure out where a man finds the time or energy to carry on with two families. - You looking for some tips?
no, I'm not looking for tips. I'm just saying it's a mess.
which isn't over.
right, the funeral.
well, you can count me out. - And we will.
Oh, come on, Grandpa. We don't really know what was going on with Tomlin's life.
I mean, maybe he was making the best of a bad situation, you know?
you saying you excuse what he did?
no, I'm just saying I'm reserving judgment until the smoke clears a little.
exactly.
I got personal items for two different women.
some need to go to the girlfriend. - Mmm, kind of got to side with Gramps on this one.
thank you.
there's a line, and men know where it's drawn.
you're also the cop on the case.
well, then I'll deliver whatever I need to.
thank you, Danny. - You got it, Dad.
guess what sector we got this morning.
judging by the smile on your face, Restaurant Row.
back to Hell's Kitchen.
Really? - Boss says we did great.
15 summonses and a felony collar.
and I volunteered us since I know you want to find Tyler again.
says who?
your niece put you on the case. - Yeah, until my sister blew a gasket.
sergeant. - Come on, friend of Nicky's or not, that kid needs help.
so let's go find him again.
but he's not gonna be hanging around Hell's Kitchen. Not after he knows we're looking for him.
Yeah, I thought the same thing till I talked to a couple of guys in Narcotics who executed a warrant on a drug spot on that very same block this morning.
and guess who was seen running from the scene.
well, let's go look for Tyler.
I knew I loved him from the moment we met.
he moved me here, and pretty soon she was on the way.
and now it's just us two.
I'm sorry it took so long, with all the... issues around Steve.
issues?
did Steve stay home every night?
no, he was undercover. Had to be gone a lot.
did he wear a ring?
no, why would he? He was single.
detective, what are you saying?
I'm saying that Steve Tomlin was married.
no.
he had two kids. Both in their 20s.
no. You're wrong. He was with me.
we were going to get married, just-just as soon as...
as soon as...
I'm sorry.
regardless of whether or not he was married, it's obvious that he loved you.
you're defending him?
surprises me, too.
look, Steve could have abandoned the both of you, but he didn't.
in fact, you should probably take a look at this.
it was in his locker, too.
deferred compensation. - Kind of like a pension.
cop gets to choose who the beneficiaries are, and Steve chose the both of you.
so Angela will be taken care of?
I'm not sure if he filed it.
but it's obvious that he wanted the both of you to be taken care of.
do you think... he would've done that if he didn't love you very much?
police!
stop!
hold it right there. - Let me go. Please.
please let me go. Please.
Why? So you can go get high again? Sorry, buddy, those days are over.
Yeah. Along with shoving police officers, which, by the way, is assault.
Hey. We tried this the easy way. Now you get the hard way.
you got anything sharp in your pockets, like a needle? Anything that's gonna stick me?
look, I don't do drugs. - Yeah, that's not what my niece says.
look, I was a screwup at school, okay?
but I stopped all that. I swear. - Yeah?
what were you passing around with your pals back there?
your report card with all A?
it was...
it was her photo.
to see if anyone's seen her.
her, who, huh?
it's just a picture.
my mom...
came down here a week ago to score and never came back home.
she's the junkie.
thanks for bringing these.
the girls'll be happy to know their father kept them so close.
I'm just trying to carry out what...
I think he'd want.
steve was a hell of a cop, and I honor that.
it's all he ever wanted to be.
well, I'll be sure and say that when I stand up for him at the funeral.
and if there's anything else my department can do...
I only have to ask.
can I ask this?
could you please not lie to me, Commissioner?
Steve's lies were bad enough, but to have all of you parade around here with your sad smiles and your pats on the back for the poor widow...
and nobody has the guts to admit what I've known for the past year?
I'm not sure I understand.
of course.
once I knew, I did what every good wife does.
blamed myself.
tried to make him love me again. I mean, I...
I do love the guy.
and the only time I lost it was when I...
I'd had too much to drink and I...
I found his phone and I called the number I didn't recognize and I told the bitch off.
told her I was the one who had stuck by him all these years and raised his family while he was out on the job.
and I hung up the phone before she could get a word in edgewise.
I'm very sorry.
you know what you could do?
skip Steve's funeral.
just skip the nice speech about how honor is such a big part of the job.
how the NYPD appreciates the sacrifices made by the families.
you might be able to get the words out, but I, for one, don't want to hear them.
his real family doesn't want to hear it.
can you do that for me?
good-bye, Commissioner.
I've got good news. - I could use some.
corporation counsel reviewed Steve Tomlin's financials.
he filled out his deferred compensation papers but never submitted them, so they're invalid.
the Staten Island family will get all the money and benefits.
and how is that good news?
well, the last thing this office needs is legal wrangling with an irate widow.
or lurid headlines about a two-timing cop.
so it's good news for this office?
what about Marianna and their baby?
well, technically, they're not his family.
technically? - I don't blame them.
doesn't take a ring to make a family.
I tried to give you an out, Frank. But you chose to be mixed up in this.
I'm just telling you where we are. - On the high moral ground, apparently.
that's not fair. - None of this is.
that's no excuse to turn our backs on a woman with a cop's baby.
look, if you can figure a way to help out both families, I'm all ears.
as far as I see it, the department's hands are tied.
you really sure I should be here?
I called your mom to ask her, but she didn't answer, so...
no, I mean because I lied to you.
we're good, Nicky. And I think that Tyler could really use a friend right about now.
Tyler. Oh, my God, I thought you moved.
that's what I told everyone. So they wouldn't know the truth.
Tyler's mom has been having some problems.
what do you mean?
first it was prescription drugs.
then it became other stuff.
ms. Jeffries disappeared about a week ago.
Tyler's been out looking for her.
why didn't you let my mom help you? Or my uncle?
because then you'd find out, and... people at school.
but...
I guess they'll all find out anyway when it's in the papers that she's dead.
Tyler, we don't know that she is. - Then why can't I find her?
I've looked everywhere. - Because she's been in the hospital.
accidental OD. She's been a Jane Doe at Bellevue for a couple days.
is there any way I can see her? - That's why I'm here.
so you did keep looking for her.
and your uncle is on his way down from Rhode Island.
you'll stay with him until your mom gets clean.
thank you so much.
all of you.
we just did what she asked.
come on.
I want a cape.
Cheers.
Yeah.
I need a little help here, Pop. - Is this about that Tomlin fellow?
his second family needs to be taken care of.
wasn't that his job?
well, he got himself killed in the line of duty before he got around to it.
so throw him a 10-13 party.
there is a three-month-old baby girl who's gonna grow up without a father.
and the problem does not get solved by some cash in a cigar box on a bar.
where is everyone?
in here.
Oh. Are you here to help your old man muscle me into pitching in?
if that's what's going on, I am now.
come on, Pop.
you're on the board of the Policeman's Fund.
Yeah, so?
so it may be time to put some of that influence to good use, Gramps.
create a back-pocket pension for one more widow and orphan.
old dog, new tricks. - I haven't said yes.
you gonna say no?
so what's going on?
I went to see the girlfriend again to confirm that Tomlin's wife did in fact call her as she claimed.
wait a minute.
the wife called the girlfriend? - The wife thought she called the girlfriend.
she found a number in Tomlin's cell phone.
she called it, thinking it would be the girlfriend on the other end.
Tomlin was undercover in Castillo's gang.
and unfortunately...
she accidentally called one of them.
Yeah.
it was Tomlin's wife who blew his cover, Gramps.
couple days later, we got a dead cop.
you got to be kidding me.
if I was kidding, someone would be laughing.
good Lord.
she loses her husband and then has to hear this.
it'll kill the woman.
unless she doesn't hear it.
I can't lie to that woman again.
she has to know.
commissioner Reagan.
I need to talk to you, Mrs. Tomlin.
I've said everything I have to say.
well,
I'm afraid I haven't.
I'm sorry, I got nothing for nobody.
I'm burying my husband tomorrow.
I didn't handle our meeting very well yesterday, and I'm sorry.
but I think...
steve would've wanted the NYPD represented at his service.
I know he would.
and it would be my honor to do that for him.
you came all the way out here just to ask me that?
Yes, I did.
Yeah.
moving on up.
believe that.
ladies we got picture.
what about the alarm? - Miles what do you think I'm doing?
Deke cool out. We like to run a loose crew around here.
you're the boss Miles. - It's like that?
it's like that.
I'm going to go check on Tulley.
Tulley. We cool down there?
yeah we cool man. - Good.
cool is good. Are you smoking?
no. Negative.
you're lying.
I smell the menthol up here man!
cut it out. What would your mama do if she knew you were smoking?
cut it out man.
Oh! Shit!
now stay alert.
you ready over here?
damn it! Eddie why you got to do that every time?
it's good luck.
it's bad luck if I land in it. Believe that.
don't fall in that shit.
see you Deke.

how's the weather up there?
snowing. - Yeah?
it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

ten feet. Closing fast.

he furned around.
forget it. He's gone.
so much for the easy part. Kit.
Aw shit! - Damn!

I can adjust to a plus-size woman.
just more cushion for the pushin'.
Janiece! Your sad-ass sack of bones is here.
I apologize. You're her cousin.
can I buy you some cereal?
it's okay Shawna.

Oh baby it must have been hard in there for you.
all alone at night in your little cot.
tell me something Miles...

thinking about you right now.
you should have thought about that...before you started robbing people!
Janiece! I never robbed you!
I'm a rehabilitated man!
talk to me.
I didn't come see you for two years. Wasn't that a sign?
I know you couldn't stand to see your man like that.
"man"?
you're not my man. You lie.
you told me you were a banker. - No.
bank robber. Sometimes I stutter.
but I'm getting that whole speech impediment thing...
you are a very smart man but the entire time we spent together...was one big lie.
look Janiece listen to me okay?
I know I lied about some things but I can change.
I don't think so. Bye!

I'll tell you what. Why don't you leave that pizza here with me?
no I'll tell you what.
last time I left a pizza here it magically disappeared.
I mean it's just like leaving candy around me.

there's two kinds of people who get through that door.
people wearing handcuffs people wearing a badge.

I don't have a badge or handcuffs so...
officer Carlson.
we want to flip that card over. - Sorry. Just got it.
excuse me Officer.
the guys in Homicide ordered this pizza about an hour ago.
I don't want to leave them with Shamu over there.
I'm not sure what you want me to do.

thank you very much.
break it down. Get down.
Two-time! Left!

you hid a diamond in a police station?
I didn't know it was a police station.
can you change the ID or not?
sure but aren't they going to be suspicious...of a pizza man with a security clearance?
I'm not going back as a pizza man. - What are you going as?
a cop. - A cop?
yeah a new transfer.
that's why I need that ID and a new file for detective.
why a detective?
that's where the rock is.
it's going to be expensive.
uncle Lou I thought we was like family.
yeah well "like family" is not family.
if you were family you'd want it for free right?

Freeze! Get 'em up!
spread your legs now. I'm an officer of the law.
any sign of Deacon?
last I heard he was pulling rip jobs in Carson.
I warned you about that guy. - That you did.
he's going to know you're out.
this is purely cosmetic. It won't check out.
don't worry. I'll be out of there in an hour max.
Thanks. - Good luck.
hey there Officer Dog.
I'm a detective. - Sorry sir.
she's never done that.
must be the pastrami.
are you going up?
yeah up. Third floor.
appreciate it.
what? - What?
the vehicle belonged to your friend but you don't remember his name?
do you have a last name?
Oh man these cuffs are tight man.
I know. - Miss Green?
could you please tell this man to loosen these cuffs?
I can't feel my fingers. I'm serious. Please.
I know it. - Detective.
not so tight.
maybe I could loosen them up a bit.
thank you.
Hello?
great lawyer there. Top of the line.
there you go.
he's in here.
Jesus.
how you all doing? - Not again Carlson.
the guy body-slammed me sir.
maybe he likes you.
get him out of here. What were you thinking?
that's not smart.
get him out of here.
come on. - Get him out.
what happened up there?
up here?
I caught him trying to escape through the ventilation system.
who the hell are you?
Malone. Just transferred. Right there.
check that out. Bam.
do you know Malone? - No sir.
nobody told me about it.
uh guys.
sorry ma'am. - Excuse me.
clear out.
let me flush please.
didn't know. You might not want to go in there.
you got some paperwork there for me Malone?
we've been requesting a new detective for eight months.
suddenly you just turn up. I'll never understand the system.
downtown bumble-dicks. Burglary huh?
sixteen citations. Mayor's commendation.
you worked out of West Covina huh?
that's what it says right there.
you look familiar Malone. Have we met before?
you wouldn't happen to be in a bowling league would you?
that's it. You're a bowler.
I try.
we could use a guy in Burglary.
Carlson!
right here. Yeah.
I thought I was going to be assigned to a desk.
right up in here! - Are you kidding me?
guy like you? No you belong on the street.
and also listen.
Carlson needs a partner with some experience.
he just got promoted.
chief I just got a call. - Carlson Malone's joining us.
show him around.
Hi. - Carlson.
let Malone do all the handcuffing okay?
I appreciate that.
I'll be reviewing these.
all right. This is the bullpen here.
that's booking up there. The holding cells are down that way.
you want to see them? - Seen one seen them all.
yeah sure. This is my desk here sir.
nice desk. - Thanks.
let's see. Brass is on five.
Robbery-Homicide they're on three. Over there?
that's the tag and bag. Sir?
through those doors that's the 10-17.
Roger.
Carlson! - Yes sir.
show him the rest later.
come on. - Where?
we got a call. Burglary. It's ours. I'll take this.
we got to go outside? - That's where the crime is.
no. See I just got here. That's not a good thing.
I got to work in here so I know what's going on out there.
I might need backup.
so how long you been in burglary?
me? All my life man.
I heard the chief say that you got 16 citations.
that's incredible. Sixteen.
that's what happens when your Uncle Lou writes your file.
Yeah.
you can ride up front if you want to.
I knew that.
you just got to be real careful for the pedestrians coming out here.
they walk right on out here.
am I clear to the right? - You're clear.
am I clear?
yeah I just made detective.
no kidding. - Yeah.
I worked traffic for three years. It was cool. I got good at it.
you don't have to stop for the yellow. You could drive through.
it's all right.
not if you've seen some of the accidents I've seen.
no thanks.
there's your green right there. - Yeah.
could I ask you a personal question? - Yeah sure!
how many times did you take the test?
what test? - You know The test. For detective.
Oh yeah that one. One time.
Really? - Yeah aced it.
really. - Yeah took it out.
Wow! Took me five tries.
I did really well on the written part...
but my performance reviews weren't so hot.
how many times did it take you to get your driver's license?
please. Wake me up when we get there.
yes sir. I'm sorry.
goodness. Man.
that's a nice suit sir. It's really cool.
I appreciate it.
yeah you know? Appreciate it.
got any music? - Oh yeah sure.
I like to jam.
just so long as we can hear the dispatcher.
that's good. I've just never heard this station.
kind of funky huh? You like that huh?
last night these shelves were loaded with Elites.
just came in yesterday. Now they're gone.
three dozen gorgeous rims. - They didn't take anything else?
no they went for my good stuff. Chrome with gold trim.
five grand worth.
what about the alarm? - What about it? It went off.
but it took you guys two hours to get here.
my wheels are probably rolling around Tijuana now.
here's where they came in.
looks like they just broke the glass...
opened the handle crawled in the window.
exactly.
shimmied down the shelf or something. - Carlson.
this is a waste of time. That's not how they got in.
course it is.
cut it out Frankie. That's not how they got in.
this is the spot right here. That's how I would have came in.
if I was a thief.
the skylight. Just cut the alarm from the inside.
I could take my time.
why take your time? - Why would I take my time?
it's heavy.
how long would it take for you to carry three dozen of those...out of the store and load them in the back of a truck?
long time. - It would take a very long time.
yeah but they probably had three or four guys working...
zip the shit up.
Frank hush 'cause you know better.
come on. Don't lie to me. I'm the man.
I'm the man Frank.
you're the man.
your five thousand sorry to tell you...is worth less than two on the street...
which don't go four ways with much juice once you rent a truck.
and to rent a truck...that requires what?
credit card...driver's license.
unless of course...you got your own truck.
he's not going to let us search his truck.
what do you mean "let us"? We're the police.
detective we need a warrant to do that.
we don't even need a key.
detective you can't do that. It's unconstitutional.
look at that. - Sir?
voila! Look at that.
solved the crime my first day on the job!
we bad detectives.
there they are! - Sir filing a false report...is a very serious crime.
whoa. No.
I'll handle this. Bring your weeble-wobble ass on over here.
you like snacks? - Yeah nothing makes me happier.

you see them ridges? - Yeah.
these ridges are going to be imprinted on the back of your ass...permanently if this happens again.

so if you want the job you got it.
excuse me?
you're the new lead detective Burglary division.

detective Malone just transferred from West Covina.
he's going to be heading up our Burglary division.
Detective...tell us a little about your plans.
I plan to fight crime.
you know shit like that.
great then.
does anybody have any questions for Detective Malone?
yeah I got a question.
what do you think about the P-31?
what do you think? - It's a piece of shit.
we've all been having problems with the P-31 right?
I'm just wondering what the new lead detective...plans to do about it.
all right. Diaz is it? - With a Z.
what do you think we should do about it Diaz?
I think we should scrap it.
how many people think we should scrap the P-31?
there it is.
scrapped. You know why? 'Cause you want it scrapped.
it's out of there. P-31. Out of there. No more. Gone.
you want 31 flavors?
Baskin and Robbins is where you want to be. Be cool.

detective.
what is it?
I'd like to work with the P-40.
yeah the P-40's good.
p-40 it is!
what's he doing? We just got those things.
he's shaking things up. Maybe that's exactly what we need.
I'm not a cop. - Malone.
this Tulley asshole's been screaming he wants to talk to you.
he's down in Interrogation.
right away. I'll talk with him.
interrogation's this way.
knew that. Is he running his mouth?
he says he has information about another robbery...
but he says he'll only talk to the officer who arrested him.
I'll talk to him. Alone.
we'll be watching.
what's going on? You said I'd only spend one night in jail!
what you want to tell me?
what is it?
you said I would spend only one night in jail.
it's only been one night.
Where's my fifty grand? - Fifty?
I said twenty grand.
well maybe it's fifty now 'cause I need...

Oh my god! What in the world...
what's going on?
help! - What is this?
police!
Oh my god.
help! I'll tell you everything!
take your hands off my client!
it's no use. He ain't talking.
that's because you have your hand over his mouth!
yeah I think we accomplished enough for one day.
wait a second. This guy said he has information on another case.
are you jerking our chain or not?
I'm not jerking your chain fella.
this guy Logan owes me $50 000.
if I don't get it soon...
I'm talking! - All right!
who's Logan and what do you know about him?
all I can tell you sir is that he's gay. Gay! Gay!
I've had enough of this...
we certainly have. Come with me.
you're going to be hearing from my office Detective.
he made me bite my tongue.
he hit me here.
next time use a phone book on him.
they took my shoelace. - Hearing from your office.
look how she's all over him.
then he said I was ugly and I couldn't read good.
hey man what's up?
where have you been? Some guy has been calling you.
who was it? - Your old partner.
said he hopes you found what you've been looking for...
because your health benefits are about to expire...
whatever that means.
shit!
Bingo!
Yeah!
what is it with you and the heating ducts sir?
cold Carlson. You don't feel that?
very cold but I'm busy. What is it you want?
I just tried to pull up your records...
and I couldn't find any Malone.
Oh you're worrying about...
that's probably because it was spelled...
when I put the name in the list...
sir the badge number doesn't exist. Yeah.
let me talk to you for a minute.
I want to find out what's going on. - You're going to find out.
now look.
what I'm about to tell you is classified.
you tell anyone...
I will bust your ass down to parade detail!
I've been on that detail. - You've been on that?
that's permanent horseshit patrol. - Yes sir.
this place is a cesspool. Yeah but listen.
I'm not from West Covina.
I'm from Internal Affairs. - Oh man!
all right? This place is a cesspool.
I can't believe I didn't notice! - But it is!
it doesn't seem like a cesspool. - Believe it man!
there's a lot of dirty shit going on here.
that's why they sent me here.
supercop here. They said "Go in there and investigate."
do what you do find another supercop.
you all supercop up as a team and crack down the shit.
crack it down. That's what I'm here to do.
are we the only guys that know about it? We're in the shit now!
you are a good cop.
but damn it you just dug too deep.
yes sir. What do you want me to do?
good thing you asked.
keep your eyes open.
I need you to be here.
and watch my back.
you got it sir. I'm out of here.
no the other way. Go back.
shit!
evidence room.
Yeah.
there you are. I just got a call.
a 4-13 is in progress at the airport.
go ahead. I'll catch up.
bullshit you'll catch up.
someone just stole a museum exhibit from a cargo hold.
that's my problem?
you're lead detective.
get your ass out there now.
the FBI and Customs Service is already on the case.
why are you standing out here? - They won't let me in.
feds are all over.
that's bullshit.
it'll take a while. These boxes contained an entire Egyptian temple.
excuse me. Let me see this. Man!
and who are you? - Malone LAPD.
agent Gray FBI.
we'II let you boys in after we're done.
look at all this stuff.
they nearly destroyed all this stuff and they didn't take none of it.
look Officer Malone.
detective.
you're out of your jurisdiction and you're over your head.
I'm over my head? No I'm over your head...
cause your head's up your ass.
you're interfering with a federal investigation Officer.
now if you and your bunch want to feel important...
you can help secure the outer perimeter.
are we clear?
Yeah. We clear.
and please tell your men not to touch anything on their way out.
it's like that? - Yeah it's like that.
head up your ass. That was great.
I couldn't believe you said that.
he called me "officer."
I am lead detective. I have 16 citations.
you think that shit comes easy?
the guy's nothing but an FBI asshole.
he thinks we're good for nothing but sucking down doughnuts. Screw him.
let them chase their own goddamn temple.
they weren't looking for no temple. They were looking for drugs.
drugs? - Yes drugs.
it's the oldest trick in the book.
you smuggle it in boost it before it hits customs.
right? Make it look like a heist.
that's how all the big boys do it.
all they have to do is look for a truck with the letter B on it.
what do you mean B? - Bonded.
bonded trucks can get into bonded warehouses.
let me ask you something. How do you know all this stuff?
did a little work in bonded warehouses.
all right then. So what are we waiting for?
let's do something all right? Come on. Call in air support.
dispatch this is 37-King-5.
put me through to South Bay Air Support.
10-12 I've got a white panel truck...
B-9-6 southbound on Wheeler...
near the Manhattan Beach intersection.
Roger. We're close.
now you're in a hurry?
sometimes you got to feed a little speed to your ride. Know what I'm saying?
here we go.
check out the driver.
yeah five foot six greasy hair messy very disheveled...
are you a hairdresser or a detective?
that's a jailhouse tat.
driver's did a stretch somewhere.
10-12 requesting backup.
LAPD this is Agent Gray FBI.
stand down. I repeat stand down.
this is bullshit.
screw them. Come on! Let's do it.
come on you!
come on. Get the door. - Come on!
drop your weapons!
don't move! - Shit!
stand still!
put 'em down! - Take him! He's yours!
don't you run from me! Don't you run!
let's see those hands butterball.
come here!
you want to make me run?
come back here!
come back here! Don't do that!
bring your ass here!
come here!
I'm not playing!
I'm not playing games!
come here!
it's okay. Don't worry. I'm a cop.
all right? It's all right. All right?
damn.
don't you know better than to run from the police?
I do.
you got me tired. I don't like to get tired.
when I get tired that means I got ass to whup.
I think that's what I'm about to do. Get your ass up!
bingo. That's the shit.
we showed them. We showed them and that's what I wanted to do you know?
book this into Evidence. - Exactly. I'll go up with it.
I want you interrogating those men right now.
I need to go up with this stuff and book it into Evidence personally.
Why?
I have to go through it for clues.
you got to interrogate the suspects. Find out where they were going.
then when you get them to talk you can go through all the evidence you want.
but sir...
if I get clues it'd make for a better ass-whupping in the interrogation room.
let's hear it for Detective Malone!
come on. You heard what he said.
that's it. I want a lawyer. You cops can't do this.
I got news for you. I ain't a cop.
God he's good.
I checked him out. West Covina never heard of him.
so you know. - Know what?
he's Internal Affairs. - What? He's not I. A.
he's not? - Hell no. He's FBI.
but he hates the FBI.
that's to throw you off. You think this thing's an accident?
he knew about the heroin thing from the start.
FBI probably planted him thinking he'd get first jump on the burglary call.
afraid we'd screw it up.
Pencil-dicks.
you don't get that kind of training at the academy.
that's old school.
you're crushing my head!
that's federal government training.
like Navy SEAL stuff.
let's go give him a hand.
all right! All right! I'll talk! I'll talk!
look at you.
it was all worth it for you baby.
what are you doing?
I'm just so happy that we keeping these drugs off the street.
get over it. They're going right back out again.
Why?
because the FBI wants to take it to their lab right away.
roll it out.
come on!
let's go.
come on.
detective.
that heroin belongs to Jean LaFleur.
we've been after him for five years...
but he keeps shifting his operations between the US and Mexico.
we're taking it down to our lab right now.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
why not? - Why don't we keep it with us?
LAFLEUR doesn't know we have it. We could use it for bait.
you mean a sting? - Exactly. A sting.
LAFLEUR expects these drugs to be in San Diego in three hours.
what kind of sting operation can you get off the ground before then?
the driver told me one of the guys on the truck was new.
you can replace him with somebody else...
then catch LaFleur when he goes to pick up the drugs.
got him!
let me get this straight.
you're volunteering to escort these drugs into the hands...of the most dangerous dealer in the Northern Hemisphere?
hell no!
what do you need to make it work?
me? - You're the man for the job.
FBI will have tactical command but we'll follow your lead.
that's very brave of you Detective. Let's go. We don't have much time.
way to go.
I'm just suggestin' some shit y'all can do.
we need more men like you.
all right. Hurry up. Go. Get out of here before someone sees you.
wait. Hold up. Wait a minute.
you wanted to go. I'm getting you out of here. Go!
you wouldn't still be here unless that diamond was here.
I want my cut! - Ain't nothing to cut.
I'm trying to but I got to get the diamond first.
go get it. I'II wait.
I'm trying to but first I got to run a sting on a drug dealer.
you're a goddamn liar. - Would I make this up? Now go!
I'll see you at Lou's tomorrow. - I want to talk about this.
wait. I don't know what you're doin' but it ain't going to work.
let me get my gun back!
damn.
maybe this isn't a good idea.
sir this is a great idea. It'll work. - It's brilliant.
LAFLEUR will be lookin' for this. - We know what we're doing Detective.
I'm a detective now?
detective can you give us a level please?
all right Detective.
the objective is to have these men look upon you as if you were one of them...
a member of the criminal underworld.
it's important that your actions your speech and your mode of behavior...
is all congruent with their expectation of a fellow criminal.
I get it. Walk the walk. - That's right.
you have to look act and even think like a criminal.
you're going to have to change your speech patterns too.
most criminals like to use slang terminology profanity...especially with regard to police and authority figures.
you mean like "Shut the hell up you dickless FBl"?
that's right. That'll do. - "You stupid ass..."
that'll do. - "You tight..."
enough!
listen up. La Fleur's a killer.
if he senses anything amiss Malone is going to be in one hell of a tight spot.
if anything happens to me forget everything I ever told you.
you mean about Internal Affairs?
I mean about everything.
detective saddle up.
okay? - Okay. Good luck.
remember. Forget it.
time to go.
detective?
if my client gets so much as a scratch while he's in your custody...
I won't stop until your badge is revoked and you're thrown in jail.
you got me?
you can't touch me.
detective! - He'll be fine Counselor.
let's get this show on the road.
drive. Buckle up.
give me video. - Let's get one thing straight.
this is my side over here and that's your side over there.
you stay on your side and I'm going to stay on mine okay?
gentlemen let's keep the chatter to a minimum.
you don't like the show change the channel.
and keep this channel clear.
who is this guy? - That's Malone.
I can't drive if you do that. - Drive!
we're coming up on our exit.
all units this is Gray. Fall back. Keep your distance.
we're approaching the site.
LAPD take the south side. We'II take the north.
they're headed into warehouse three.
focus in. Closer.
this is it.
you're sure? - Warehouse three.
sit tight and keep your mouth shut.
thanks for the tip.
what the hell's Malone doing?
they're coming in. They're right behind you.
get ready. Here he comes.
that's what I'm talking about!
that's the shit. - You're right! That's the shit!
all 500 kilos!
what are you talkin' about? Let's get out of here 'cause I want my cut.
you still got him? - We have a signal but if's distorfed.
can you hear him?
we can't get out of here okay? They got cops everywhere.
so? You're one of them.
I'm a drug dealer now.
listen. You're a jewel thief.
I'm a drug dealer now!
why are you sellin' this shit when you got that big diamond in your hand?
just like old times? - I don't believe that shit!

what's going on? - I don't know.
Tulley? - I never know what's going on.
bring it in! Over here!
out of the truck. - Come on. Get out.
what's going on? - It took longer than I thought.
what happened to your face? - Nothing. Not a big deal.
who are these two guys? Who hired them? - I did. You told me to get guys. I did.
you didn't introduce me. How you doin'?
Pete. Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.
who might you be?
you don't want to mess with him. That's a stone-cold killer.
you don't want to mess with him. He's stone cold.
that boy is bad.
I seen him rip somebody's guts out through their ass...and their eyes fell out.
do the move that you do the gut-and-eyes move.
all right.
that's where the guts went splat. Just dropped them.
I'm bad.
I'm bad baby. I'll rip your lips off and kiss my ass with them shits.
I seen him do it. - That's how I get down baby.
I'II rip your tongue out and lick my balls with them.
shut up. Check him out.
francois you search him.
they're on to him. We're moving in. - Wait.
this must be part of his plan. Malone knows what he's doing.
what plan? He's unarmed and outnumbered.
trust me. You should see Malone's resume.
this is like a walk in the park for him.
I must tell you Pete.

but you still stink like a cop.
Damn! I knew he was going to catch us man!
shut up. He's lying. That's bullshit. Shut up.

see what I'm saying? He's lying.
if I was a cop would I have busted his... Shit! All that's bleeding.
trickling now. - Lock him in the car.
that's right. Get him out of here.
if I was a cop would l... - Shut up!
my nose's bleeding.
Damn!
tell us the truth.
he's a cop.
he hijacked the truck. This is a setup.
if I was a cop FBI would be here right now man takin' everybody to jail.
I think I have an idea.

you want to prove you're not a cop?
Yeah.
you say he's lying.
damn right he's lying. - Shoot him.

no Lieutenant. I will not slow down.
is this man one of yours or not?
you bet your ass he is.
well I'm going to find out what happened here...
even if it means putting your entire department under federal review.
yeah? - Nice work.
my office just spent the last hour talking...to West Covina and the US Attorney's Office...
trying to find out who you're working for.
now we know it's not the bureau.
I think it's time you gave us an explanation.
I'm a federale. - A federale?
look across that border. What do you see?
that is the Democratic Republic of Mexico.
you're Mexican? - On my mother's father's side.
I can see it. - Glasias thank you.
I shouldn't be tellin' y'all this because I could lose my federale-hood.
your what? - My federale-hood.
I had to throw you guys off okay?
I was doing it for my country.
the red the white...and the green.
if you guys will excuse me I must get across this border...
and school some of my compadres you know...on things we like to talk about.
so y'all stay up. Be cool.
what's happening? Hook a brother up with a taco!
a burrito!
I can't believe so much bad shit can happen on such a beautiful day.
yeah? What?
I think your Spanish is a little rusty.
you just told those men you got a big cat in your pants.
that's a Latin thing.
macho. You wouldn't understand.
I think I do understand...
what?
how'd you know it was me?
I started thinking if I was Miles Logan...
and I had my diamond hidden in a police building...
what would I do?
so I thought like a crook.
is that right? I don't believe this.
he's a major felon.
this is one hell of a bust.
yeah it's a hell of a bust for us.
it's just too bad we can't make it.
say what?
you heard the FBI.
they're extremely strict about pursuing suspects across international borders...
and you're just out of our jurisdiction.
your...
exactly because I'm across...
so if I'm across the border and you're over there there's no way that you...
Yeah! I love this jurisdiction shit.
Oh man.
so I guess this is the last time I'm going to see you boys?
yeah but you know maybe we'll catch you later.
is it like that? - Yeah it's like that.
adios amigo.
Adios.

Thanks.
you know what I mean? - Yeah.
and I'm out!
keep him steady. - Watch the corner.
I got it.

he's fat.
the fuck's that supposed to mean?
he's insulated. I don't know. How should I know?
the cold and the buckshot.
I'm not a doctor.
Really?
I thought we killed them all.
he thought. Fuckin' Aristotle.
so what are they doing to him?
what difference does it make?
this guy's got a hole in his belly big as a grapefruit.
he thaws out a little. He's a goner.
so now you're a doctor.
what are you mad at me for? - I'm late.
let nature take its course. Help it along if you can.
and you'd better hope he dies real soon.
quick now, close the doors.
about time, eh?
Yeah, well, this nag isn't exactly man o' war.
you didn't happen to run at Saratoga last summer, did you?
let's go. Open it up.
I'm do a bottle count as soon as we're done.

I can mix this up real nice.
500 bottles will get you 3000.
so how're we working the split?
assuming this batch goes well 8020, my favor.
I supply the product; you and your people work your magic.
that's a whole lot of magic for only 20%.
it's the same deal I gave Mickey Cusick.

I did.
40%. - What happened to 30?
I charged you 10% extra for thinking I'd take the same deal as Mickey.

I suppose you'd have to be, after what you put up with.
I'm considering taking in a boarder.
what, some burlesque performer?
come stay with me if you like.
thank you. We couldn't.
what about your own people? Have you thought about going home?
I came to this country for a better life.

I'll just be a few minutes.

you're obstructing a federal investigation, sheriff.
so get a warrant.
stay here and guard this witness.

almost there. Hold still.
Jesus, if I knew this was the cure, I'd have taken my chances fighting the huns.
you should've thought of that before intentionally exposing yourself to gonorrhea, Mr. Luciano.
the good news is the zinc sulfate treatments have worked.
your symptoms have abated?
the faucet stopped dripping, if that's what you mean.
and urination, any burning, itching?
nothing I can't take. It's just...
what?
sometimes I... I don't know.
it's like when I'm doing it, or trying to do it with a broad...
Yes.
well... It starts out fine, and then it goes away.
your penis becomes flaccid?
come again? - It doesn't stay hard.
sometimes, yeah.
what are you doing? What, are you writing a book?
Mr. Luciano, I need to document your recovery, the course of treatment.

you know, I'd have a baby if that's what you want. - What?
it'd ruin my figure, but if that's what you want...
don't you think i'd make a good mommy?
well, sure you would well.
you have a very loving disposition.
so?
this is a hotel. I'm not set up here for a baby.

you can kill someone for me to settle a debt.
I have it on good authority that a James Darmody of Atlantic city was one of the two shooters.
who was the other one?
I don't know.
but I'd bet you're persuasive enough to get Darmody to tell you.
that's a good bet. - The only kind I make.
you are alone.
lonely.
but there is a man dark.
you know me.
there's always a man.
Oh, this one. He's not like the others.

he's fine, Gillian.
he's not fine.

I don't know what you're talking about.
you promised you would keep him out of trouble.
he's not in trouble.
do you think I'm blind, that I don't hear things?
he shows up out of nowhere with some $1000 necklace, which he then steals back from me.
it's a rough patch, okay?
he just got back.
we take it for granted, but I'm sure the entire war was very trying.
he should have stayed in college.
I advised him to.
he wouldn't listen.
leading a horse to water and all that.
he's a grown man who wanted to serve his country.
could I have forced him not to?
I was under the impression that you could do anything.
I'm not God, Gillian.
now you tell me.
where the fuck is this place?
the dope was waiting outside.
cause you didn't give me the right address.

Yes, supervisor. Van Alden here.
Nelson, where are you?
the post office, Atlantic city.
the post office?
it's the only federal building in town.
we lost him, sir.
damn it. Did he talk?
that's the reason I'm calling.
sir, I have reason to believe James Darmody was involved in the woods massacre.
Darmody. Why do I know that name?
he's Thompson's lackey, sir. We tried to recruit him.
right. Yes.
given as how the local sheriff is Thompson's brother, the level of cooperation I'm likely to receive here necessitates my handling this arrest myself.
what arrest? - Darmody, sir. For murder.
easy, laddybuck.
you sit tight till I speak with Bodine in the U. S. Attorney's office.
when will that be, sir?
get some rest. Go home and see Rose.
I'll call you in a few days.
I'll be right here, sir. - Go home, Nelson.
visit your wife. That's an order.
and good job.
close the door.
have a seat.
your pal from the woods. He's dead.
good.
that'll keep him quiet. - He already talked.
he fingered you to the feds.
that's impossible.
how would he even know who I was?
the other one Carbone.
did he call you by name?
when you were 10 years old, 11 maybe.
I don't know if you'll even remember this.
president Taft came to town, some campaign speech.
you were in the crowd.
I suppose you were with your dad.
but you turned to me and said, "Nuck, what's a fella gotta do to become president?
I said, "well, you gotta study, learn everything you can about the world and do a lot of hard work.
and you looked up at me in disbelief and said,"Gee, is that all?
I used to think you'd own the world one day.
you were like that kid in the Alger story Raggy Dick.
you did everything right.
and then. Nuck, I'll do whatever you want.
what you'll do is leave.
leave Atlantic city? - You're through here, kid.
where am I supposed to go?
I hear California's nice.
maybe Chaplin needs a foil.
I've got a kid to feed, Eli.
and I got eight, which is why I think before I go off halfcocked.
what, you're gonna lecture me now?
if it was up to me, it wouldn't stop with a lecture.
take this money, give it to your wife.
I want you to know, Nuck, I never meant to hurt you.
what are you gonna do, cry, big war hero?
good luck, James.
I wonder sometimes if it was me, would you behalf as understanding?
I have a right to know where you're going.
I told you, I can't talk about it, okay?
no, it's not okay. You're a grown man with a child.
am I?
what?
why are you fighting?
we're not fighting, sweetie.
Tommy buddy, go play inside.
so that's it? You're just leaving?
you seemed to be okay with it last time.

he's three years old. He's friendly with everyone.

cause I will go back there and I will fucking kill him.
what's wrong with you?
this man, his wife. They're lovely people.
they be friended me and your son when we had no one.
there was my mother.
you don't know what it was like being alone, not knowing whether you were dead or alive.
and just as I get used to living without you, you show up out of nowhere.
what did you expect? - I don't know!
for things to be normal.
things were barely normal before you left, Jimmy.
we hardly even knew each other.
well, you know me a lot better now.
make sure the labels are on straight, no glue running off the sides.
bring the packard around.
let me get one of them.

what's "motherfucker" mean?
I suppose it's a shvartze word.
why aren't you eating?
I'm not hungry.
you need your strength back.
I'm stronger than I look, Edith.
I suppose you'd have to be, after what you put up with.
I'm considering taking in a boarder.
what, some burlesque performer?
come stay with me if you like.
thank you. We couldn't.
what about your own people? Have you thought about going home?
I came to this country for a better life.
when's the baby coming, mama?
I don't know, dear.
the stork must have gotten lost.

I'm gonna make you a brisket, some potatoes on the side.
that'd be lovely.
Mrs. Schroeder?
who are you? - I'm Mrs. Schroeder.
a job for you from Mr. Thompson.
my deepest condolences on account of your husband.
the Ritzcarlton.

and how do you know a man like Nucky Thompson?
through a friend.
the temperance league.
I'll need you to look after the children.
those French I've read about them.
all right. You all set?
that wound needs attention.
later. I need to question him. - This man is gravely ill.
he has a massive internal infection.
I'll just be a few minutes.
what did he do, officer?
go to sleep.
what's that?
what did you say?
what's going on over there?
so what do you know about Saturday night's events?
is he all right?
you don't say.
how many men?
you can't goin there.
you can't goin there.
poor bastard.
sir?
sir, can you hear me? - He needs his rest.

go on now. Shoo.
you're obstructing a federal investigation, sheriff.
so get a warrant.
stay here and guard this witness.
jeez.
almost there. Hold still.
Jesus, if I knew this was the cure, I'd have taken my chances fighting the huns.
you should've thought of that before intentionally exposing yourself to gonorrhea, Mr. Luciano.
the good news is the zinc sulfate treatments have worked.
your symptoms have abated?
the faucet stopped dripping, if that's what you mean.
and urination, any burning, itching?
nothing I can't take. It's just...
what?
sometimes I... I don't know.
it's like when I'm doing it, or trying to do it with a broad...
Yes.
well... It starts out fine, and then it goes away.
your penis becomes flaccid?
come again? - It doesn't stay hard.
sometimes, yeah.
what are you doing? What, are you writing a book?
Mr. Luciano, I need to document your recovery, the course of treatment.
forget it. I'm fine.
forget I said nothin'.
but look, you hear what I say or what?
sure, put me down for a grand.
well, it's a wonderful cause.
Righto. I'm glad I could help.
who're you giving money to now? - Nobody.

that place gives me the willies.
you were so smart not to have children.
you know, Flo's in town.
who? - Ziegfeld.
Eddie says he's casting for the "nine o'clock frolic.
my Eddie? - Eddie Cantor.
I thought you were done with all that.
do you want me to be?
whatever makes you happy, kid.
you make me happy.
you know, I'd have a baby if that's what you want. - What?
it'd ruin my figure, but if that's what you want...
don't you think i'd make a good mommy?
well, sure you would well.
you have a very loving disposition.
so?
this is a hotel. I'm not set up here for a baby.
we could get a house in Cape May. - Now's not a good time.
let's revisit this after the election.
okay.
mm, that's delicious.
that looks delicious.
that looks delicious too.
how'd you get him to sit so long? - What?
Oh, I don't know. The photographer made him laugh.
he said he's one of the best looking children he's ever seen.
Yeah, that's how they get your money.
you don't think your son's handsome?
sure he is I mean, with you for a mother.
let's go find the other people.
it's hard to believe he was ever this little.
three years is a long time.
you don't like the vacuum sweeper?
it just makes such a racket.
it's more efficient. - It scares Tommy.
all in the name of progress.

the Lewis gun. I used one at Saintmihiel.
we used to talk about books.
you are too thin.
when do you last bathe?

good. You must bathe once a week at a minimum
your hair as well, and fingernails each day.
you will not dirt your garments or cause them to stench.
you've worked before in a shop?
no, ma'am. I was a servant.
the last girl, Rosalie, Four years of experience.
what became of her? - Mr. Thompson.
she had to be how to say? Jettison to give the job for you.
I'm sorry. I didn't know. - You're sorry?
what are to be my duties, Madame Jeunet?
you are a dresser.
you will assist the customers when they try the garments on,
occasionally you will wear our merchandise.
so the customer may visualize what it looks like not from the mannequin.
you will be prompt and you will work late when I require.
no, ma'am. Small phrases here and there.
yet I speak your English.
Yes.

Yes, ma'am. - Seen. You do not speak.
Really? - Yes.

Jesus, Eli. This is serious.
say, I'm not the one got us into this mess, right?
save the insolence for Jimmy.
this is a writ of certiorari from the federal magistrate in Philadelphia giving me custody and jurisdiction over the patient known as John Doe. Any questions?
I... I need to telephone somebody.
telephone whoever you'd like. Follow me, men.
you're making a big mistake.
come on, push him in.
a writ of certiorari? Jesus Christ, boss.
don't take the lord's name in vain.
for Christ we just broke about a dozen laws.

well, congratulations.
I was away in the war.

the news accounts, the battles at Ypresin particular some thrilling tales.
I would not have minded having my mettle tested like that.

who shot you?
we have to find a doctor.
open.
wider, please.
mind Dr. Lissenger.
you eat peanut brittle. This is what happens.
what's the meaning of this? - Out of the chair, kid, now!
I'm a dentist. - Out of the chair, kid, now!
okay, now you got something to, you know, boost his system, give him some pep?
this man is dying. - He needs a surgeon.
well, you keep him alive! I need to speak with him!
uh, cocaine. It's an anesthetic.
I only know how to put it in one place.
what's taking so long?
he needs a larger dose. - What are you waiting for?
all right, who shot you? What'd he look like?
what language is that?
it's gutter German. Yiddish.
What'd he say? - I can't.
Mrs. Fishbaum. - Word for word. This is a federal investigation.

and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever;
and they shall have no rest day nor night, they who worship the beast.
he's all yours.
new YORK CITY - Okay, gents. - 2000.
hand like a foot.

I'll see your two and raise you two.
what should I do here, Charlie?
depends on what the other guy got.
depends on what the other gentleman has.
right.
well? What does he have?
how should I know? I'm no swami.
the very reason this game is so challenging.
there's a lot of money in that pot.
how much do you think is in there?
plenty. - $22, 500.
that's right.
how much mining equipment do you have to sell to make 22 grand, buck?
a lot.

I'll see your two. And raise you five.
take it. I was bluffing.
I know.
so was i.
God damn it! - What say we take a break?
only 14 hours and you're tired already?
unfortunate.
son of a gun.
you wanted to see me?
Yeah, it turns out my sister in law's nephew.
for a time at least survived the shooting in the woods.
well, I'm sorry about your loss.
obviously, if there's anything I can do... - There is actually.
you can kill someone for me to settle a debt.
I have it on good authority that a James Darmody of Atlantic city was one of the two shooters.
who was the other one?
I don't know.
but I'd bet you're persuasive enough to get Darmody to tell you.
that's a good bet. - The only kind I make.
you are alone.
lonely.
but there is a man dark.
you know me.
there's always a man.
Oh, this one. He's not like the others.
he's dangerous.
mm, do tell.
I'm hearing my future.
I'm very busy, Gillian.
give us a couple of minutes.
you could have come see me, you know.
request an audience with the other peasants?
I didn't want to run into Jimmy.
what can I do for you?
you can honor the agreement that we made.
he's fine, Gillian.
he's not fine.
I'm his mother.
he's a shell.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you promised you would keep him out of trouble.
he's not in trouble.
do you think I'm blind, that I don't hear things?
he shows up out of nowhere with some $1000 necklace, which he then steals back from me.
it's a rough patch, okay?
he just got back.
we take it for granted, but I'm sure the entire war was very trying.
he should have stayed in college.
I advised him to.
he wouldn't listen.
leading a horse to water and all that.
he's a grown man who wanted to serve his country.
could I have forced him not to?
I was under the impression that you could do anything.
I'm not God, Gillian.
now you tell me.
where the fuck is this place?
the dope was waiting outside.
cause you didn't give me the right address.
what, is it raining out?
raining?
I almost drowned, Leo.
he almost drowned.
thanks for bailing me out.
I gotta protect my investment, eh?
we would've met you at the jail, but we've been getting the lay of the land.
fuck the land.
the boardwalk's where the money's at.
so where're you staying?
some flop house on Baltic, off the beach.
doc says the salt air helps his respiratory.
that, plus the 15 warrants waiting back in Philly.
ain't you got a lawyer, Pius?
I'm Pius, you stupid Bollack. - The name's Doyle now.
so? - Go check on the car.
I'm Ignacious.
I thought that was Lucien.
no, Lucien got the birthmark.
you fucking garliceaters.
what, is there like 14 of youse?
nine, not counting our sisters.
our pop. He loves our mother very much.
so this Nucky Thompson, eh?
gave our entire operation over to the coons.
you believe that? - Our operation?
I loaned you that dough with vigorish.
he gets took for a chump and now we're partners all of a sudden?
I thought you guys were looking for an opportunity.
we're looking for our money.
how can I pay youse if they put me out of business?
that's your problem, ain't it?
we have a very important customer.
you will take these to her in the dressingroom, eh?
whatever she needs.
Hello?
finally.
are you gonna help me get out of this thing or what?
you came to see Nucky.
Yes. I'm Margaret Schroeder.
bully for you.
when we're done here, drop my cloak off with your tailor.
your boss is having the lining repaired for me.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't go for cheap merchandise.
I'll try the stepin.
the stepin.
that one.
Jesus, sister.
I'm sorry.
well, you do work here, don't you?
I do. - So open it up.
tie it.
well?
what do you think?
it's very flattering.
you know, I heard Nucky on the phone getting you this job.
it was very kind of him.
Yeah, well, he's a soft touch for the charity cases.
Yes, I'll hold.
they're putting me through.
the elephant hotel.
dear Lenore, Douglas had another attack of dropsy, so we came down for his benefit.
the ocean is lovely.
I had an uncle once had dropsy.
you're reading someone's private correspondence.
go ahead, please.
Yes, supervisor. Van Alden here.
Nelson, where are you?
the post office, Atlantic city.
the post office?
it's the only federal building in town.
we lost him, sir.
damn it. Did he talk?
that's the reason I'm calling.
sir, I have reason to believe James Darmody was involved in the woods massacre.
Darmody. Why do I know that name?
he's Thompson's lackey, sir. We tried to recruit him.
right. Yes.
given as how the local sheriff is Thompson's brother, the level of cooperation I'm likely to receive here necessitates my handling this arrest myself.
what arrest? - Darmody, sir. For murder.
easy, laddybuck.
you sit tight till I speak with Bodine in the U. S. Attorney's office.
when will that be, sir?
get some rest. Go home and see Rose.
I'll call you in a few days.
I'll be right here, sir. - Go home, Nelson.
visit your wife. That's an order.
and good job.
close the door.
have a seat.
your pal from the woods. He's dead.
good.
that'll keep him quiet. - He already talked.
he fingered you to the feds.
that's impossible.
how would he even know who I was?
the other one Carbone.
did he call you by name?
when you were 10 years old, 11 maybe.
I don't know if you'll even remember this.
president Taft came to town, some campaign speech.
you were in the crowd.
I suppose you were with your dad.
but you turned to me and said, "Nuck, what's a fella gotta do to become president?
I said, "well, you gotta study, learn everything you can about the world and do a lot of hard work.
and you looked up at me in disbelief and said,"Gee, is that all?
I used to think you'd own the world one day.
you were like that kid in the Alger story Raggy Dick.
you did everything right.
and then. Nuck, I'll do whatever you want.
what you'll do is leave.
leave Atlantic city? - You're through here, kid.
where am I supposed to go?
I hear California's nice.
maybe Chaplin needs a foil.
I've got a kid to feed, Eli.
and I got eight, which is why I think before I go off halfcocked.
what, you're gonna lecture me now?
if it was up to me, it wouldn't stop with a lecture.
take this money, give it to your wife.
I want you to know, Nuck, I never meant to hurt you.
what are you gonna do, cry, big war hero?
good luck, James.
I wonder sometimes if it was me, would you behalf as understanding?
I have a right to know where you're going.
I told you, I can't talk about it, okay?
no, it's not okay. You're a grown man with a child.
am I?
what?
why are you fighting?
we're not fighting, sweetie.
Tommy buddy, go play inside.
so that's it? You're just leaving?
you seemed to be okay with it last time.
what are you talking about? - What am I talking about?
what? - What?
your shoulders are bare; That look on your face.
I thought you'd like it. - I would have.
plenty of fellas at the front had pictures of their sweet hearts.
how would I have known where to send it?
not a letter in almost two years, Jimmy.
I thought you were dead.
the baby yesterday we went down to the boardwalk.
he's awfully friendly with that photographer.
he's three years old. He's friendly with everyone.
did you fuck him while I was gone?
cause I will go back there and I will fucking kill him.
what's wrong with you?
this man, his wife. They're lovely people.
they be friended me and your son when we had no one.
there was my mother.
you don't know what it was like being alone, not knowing whether you were dead or alive.
and just as I get used to living without you, you show up out of nowhere.
what did you expect? - I don't know!
for things to be normal.
things were barely normal before you left, Jimmy.
we hardly even knew each other.
well, you know me a lot better now.
make sure the labels are on straight, no glue running off the sides.
bring the packard around.
let me get one of them.
the roast tastes good.
this boy's not 20 years old.
it's a tragedy, Chalky.
is that what it is?
this goes no further than here, you understand me?
you talk to these people.
it's an election year, Chalky.
the last thing we need is a race war.
do you understand me?
for the time being.
what happened is this man was cheating with another fella's wife.
and the fella shot him.
that's what it looks like to me.
50%.
hunger, mama.
Broadway limited going to Chicago, Illinois.
Broadway limited going to Chicago, Illinois.
Mr. Mellon, are we talking about gross incompetence inside the Justice Department or widespread corruption?
human nature leaves ample room for both.
I don't want no problem while I'm gone. I thought Torrio had you on a leash.
well, he left town and I chewed through it.
but you pay him, right? I mean, he gets his taste no matter what.
every business has its costs.
I need your help. I must dispose of a body.
it's a series of classes intended...
I know about it already. All of it.
please come if you can.
you indicting me, Harry?
indict Remus instead. - That's never gonna happen.
president Harding would never force Mr. Daugherty's hand.
unless someone made him. - Such as?
I hope to offer my services as a fountain of information regarding the Attorney General.
I don't think it's wise. Don't we both know how to keep a secret?
you put yourself on the line. I'll be making a change.
you're running the warehouse with Mickey. Thank you.
they're working together. Give me your blessing.
I'll kill 'em all. What is this?
lovely heroin. My son is dead.
and nothing will ever bring him back.
I spoke with the coroner.
he made the change you requested.
accidental drowning. Mr. Whitlock made a persuasive case for discretion.
there is the grandchild in the matter.
I thought I had my son back.
then he would reach for the needle.
and nothing I could do could stop him.
would you like a few more minutes? Yes, that's very kind...
we've made our farewells already, I think.
would you like to say a last word, Mr. Harrow?
you two were close.
Jimmy deserved better than this.
you pour your mash in the kettle, your corn, yeast... what have you... mix it with the water.
and you plug in the stopper, insert your tubing, and fire up the heat.
you wanna keep it around 172, not quite boiling.
as it all cools down, drips out here, and abracadabra.
whiskey. - What'd I tell ya?
he's not half as dumb as he looks. What's this?
we'll be out of your hair in a minute, dear. You're welcome as a guest in our home.
what about the smell? - What about it?
we have neighbors.
between the cabbage and the fish in that hallway, who's gonna notice?
besides, half of them are doing the same thing.
I got people like you all over the North Side, George.
practically an army. Nice little sideline.
except you, of course, are working off a debt...
for my help getting rid of that probie's body.
I understand. - Good.
I want two cases a week.
that's 24 bottles.
Oh, and tomorrow you're coming with us to a meeting.
be on the corner of Wabash and 23rd at 11: 00 a. m.
I have a job, sir. You'll figure something out.
peddles irons. You believe that?
9: 00 a. m. the Hotel Astor.
I'm on the overnight express.
new York? - Tomorrow, just for the day.
Rothstein or your other girlfriend? Neither, actually.
where are we with the pony? - Hot tip?
for Emily's birthday. - She can hardly walk.
just stating the obvious. That's what the pony's for.
she'll love it. So what do you think?
morgans are nice. Calm disposition.
or a Shetland maybe. June's sister had one. They can get a bit feisty.
chomped her pinky trying to grab a carrot. We don't want to coddle her, Eli.
leave it to me. I'll get her all fixed up.
I... I don't quite know how to say this.
just start yammering like always.
James Darmody is dead.
that is pure speculation. No. He has drowned.
the death notices.
mishap while bathing at the home of his mother Mrs. Gillian Darmody.
ja.
what the fuck?
I'm terribly sorry for your loss. Don't be an idiot.
Chicago
I mean, you walk down the street and there's these ruins just sitting there, thousands of years old.
look who's back.
so how was it? - Give me a new perspective, that's for sure.
the medigans... t's a fucking rat race over here.
italy, they take it slow. A little bread, a little vino.
what, you want wine? We got a whole fucking distillery.
we don't have the feeling. He was just telling me about the volcano.
what volcano? - Vesuvius.
that's near Naples. I know that. I was just there.
he says the whole place is falling to pieces. That's not f... I mean the way they live.
before we hear about the holiday...
Yeah, uh, John, welcome home.
so we had a little eruption here, too. Joe Miller.
do I know him? - He's with O'Banion.
at least he was. - So he's past tense.
he insulted Jake, smacked him around. And O'Banion... how'd he take it?
he's touchy. I kept it on ice.
he's gonna come by the yards tomorrow to hash it out.
I didn't write 'cause I know you was trying to relax.
I mean, I know you said you didn't want no problems, and I'm sure you're sore, but there was nothing I could do.
you did what you thought was right.
Yeah.
tomorrow, then.
there's still the matter of Tommy's guardianship.
whatever it costs. - You're raising him in a whorehouse.
it's a health resort.
they're going to want to inspect everything, you know.
ahem, ma'am, Mr. Thompson is calling.
show him in.
do you know what you can always rely on in this business?
what?
sooner or later, everyone steps through your door.
Leander, would you mind if I spoke with Mrs. Darmody alone?
you're working toward something. Remember that.
I've come to offer my condolences.
how very kind. You can imagine my shock when I saw this morning's paper.
a young man cut down in his prime.
a troubled young man.
driven to narcotics, truth be told.
I hadn't even realized he was back in town.
last week.
back from one of his excursions.
I would very much liked to have seen him.
and he you, I'm sure.
things were rather tense last time.
to James.
shall we stop now with all this nonsense?
it is nonsense, isn't it?
we should really be drinking to the sap who died in your tub.
you killed my son, Nucky.
you're out of your mind. - And I'll never see him again.
a man who buried a son himself...
I had nothing to do with any of that. To stand there and lie to my face!
after all the disappointments, the false promises... I kept every one to him and to me.
here's what I came to tell you.
whatever you're trying to pull, there's something you'd best keep in mind...
you exist in this town because I allow you to.
and all in all, I'd say that's...
very generous of you.
you'd be wise to say that like you mean it.
well, next is the delicate matter of the act itself.
something you're looking forward to, is it?
my concern is that it be placed within the proper moral context.
I'm here to keep him on the path, Sister.
I will see you both next Thursday.
am I wrong or is she flirting with me?
every time we talk, she always brings it around to sex.
Mrs. Shearer. - Do you have a question?
I need to talk to her.
well, I have reports to attend to and maybe a chance to actually eat dinner, so...
I'm glad you were able to come to the classes.
I hope you're finding them useful.
if there's anything... - My husband won't keep off me.
I told him I wasn't ready.
and he waited for a while, but now...
did you explain to him that it still isn't...
I don't want another child, no matter what.
that's not something we're allowed to discuss here.
it's what every woman who came tonight wants to know.
I made a promise to the sister... You came to me, you offered help.
I... there is a pamphlet I can give you.
it explains different methods...
I don't need a pamphlet or some man to tell me what I already know.
when you first saw me and I was bleeding...
I wasn't...
yes?
I stored the milk.
I waited.
it wasn't an accident.
you understand?
I drank it on purpose to lose the baby.
I won't go through that again.
what do you need?
one of those Dutch caps that go up here so I can control things.
but I don't know how to get one. You have to ask a doctor.
a doctor won't give me a diaphragm. A doctor won't even listen to me.
doctors only listen to ladies like you.
it is okay, husband.
sleep.
plan to take in any shows while you're in New York?
I hadn't really considered it.
"dizzy Izzy" is a lot of laughs. I could set you up with house seats.
let's keep the favors to a minimum.
what do you do for fun, Esther?
I run naked through the pages of the United States Criminal Code.
Really?
I believe I can say with some conviction that the arrangements are in place.
where is he?
miss Randolph, do you wish to be privy to these revelations?
in for a penny.
mm, I applaud your boldness.
secretary Mellon is in Manhattan today attending to matters particular to his private enterprises.
he will, as a creature of habit, take his luncheon at the Union Club on 51st Street and 5th Avenue.
how do I get in there? - You, Mr. Thompson, cannot.
however, Mr. Charles Rickson of Missouri can, owing to a reciprocal agreement with the Kansas City Club.
you have prospered mightily in beef, Mr. Rickson, and your name is on the register.
what do I need to know?
andrew Mellon is one of the richest men in the world.
as the head of the Treasury Department, he's responsible for enforcing Prohibition as well as collecting the income tax, neither of which I understand him to be partial to.
and he despises Harry Daugherty.
whom he regards as no more than a common thief...
not to cast dispersions on our employer.
is that enough to get Mellon to arrest Remus?
the secretary's business interests are manifold.
he is prominent in finance, steel, coal.
he is also the majority shareholder in the Old Overholt Distillery in West Overton, Pennsylvania.
andrew Mellon owns a distillery? Pointless possession in this day and age, but it is remarkable how large small irritations can loom in the minds of great men.
that's all you're going to give me?
rather more than you walked in with.
arrest will be a tribute to your resourcefulness.
you know, I don't think
I do want to hear everything.
come on, come on, come on.
you notice anything funny lately?
what do you mean? - At work.
you know, the way people been acting.
Johnny say anything to you? - About what?
about what happened... Joe Miller.
Why? Was he sore? I don't know. Didn't say nothing.
I don't like this, Jake. It's where the meat comes from.
hitch up your pants. They're hanging off your ass.
boys! - John!
you want coffee? - I had espresso at home.
look at this place.
you believe the stink? - It's where the meat comes from.
Dean, how you been? - John.
you know Hymie Weiss. - Good to see you.
there's a new face. - He's my muscle.
what's in the case? - Tell him, George.
irons. - Yeah.
press you out nice and flat. Where you from?
me? Cicero.
so this Joe Miller business... I've been very well behaved.
cooled my heels waiting for you... - I was over in Naples.
different world, Deanie. - Meanwhile...
people there... very gracious with each other.
you know why? - All due respect...
because they understand life is short.
threats? Really?
you show up after months and you got the gall... Hey! John's talking.
he took a fucking barstool to Joe Miller's head. Standing in our speak like you own the fucking joint.
this is how you settle a beef... - Yeah.
when I'm the one who kept my word, huh?
Pompeii. - What?
Pom-peii. You heard of it?
the town was buried in 79 A. D.
these poor fuckin' souls... for generations they're next to this mountain.
they got no idea it's actually a volcano.
one day, they're going about their affairs and boom!
the lava covers everything.
not even time to run. - Right.
they're still there... hundreds of them, frozen, like statues.
one fella... a blacksmith or something...
still got the hammer in his hand.
he died doing what?
banging on some tin for a few shekels or whatever they used.
and losing that money...
he was more afraid of that than losing his life.
so Joe Miller.
al here's gonna work something out. I came here to settle with you.
well, there's your mistake, Deanie.
cause the person to talk to was Al.
the past is for suckers, right?
depends what happens in the future.
John said to talk, so let's talk.
let's have a look at you.
you're quite serious about this. It's wise to be.
there's more blood spilled at horse fairs than anywhere else.
did you have one in Coleraine? - Oh, aye.
great gas of a day.
Yeah, my dad put on his best, strolled down the high street like a grand man, jiggling the coins in his pocket. What did he do?
he was only a clerk for the ironmongers, you had to admire it, but he... he had a certain air.
and a shilling for me to spend as I liked.
licorice rope. Fry's Chocolate Cream.
what of yourself?
we had a Welsh Cob for plowing.
I'd ride him when I could. Till my father drank him away.
I did so love the fair, though.
people from miles around...
old bachelors down from the hills, tinkers on the road, dancing and songs coming out from the pubs.
bit of life to the world, wasn't it?
we'd sneak away and wander.
and my brother Eamonn...
what? What of him?
nothing.
he'd walk behind someone...
ahem, a fat man, or bandy-legs, and imitate him when he couldn't see.
all I could do to keep from falling in the mud laughing.
so you approve?
of Kip here? Aye.
seems right enough.
well, folks?
take him around the paddock, see what he's like.
the lady wants some time to think it over.
can't see a thing. In the theater, you know there's an audience out there.
maybe you think you're too good for the movies.
why would I think that? Something I've noticed with you stage types.
Oh, I don't think I'm too good for anything.
I mean, I love them.
what do you love about them? I don't know.
sit in the dark, stare up into the screen, forget who you are for a while.
most people say "where you are."
pardon?
you said "forget who you are."
is that what you're trying to do?
aren't we all?
turn left.
and right.
look up.
holy thoughts.
okay, let's see how the camera likes you. You wanna do that?
why else would anyone schlep out to Queens? Sassy.
you know Gil Longacre?
I did "Full Steam Ahead" with Mr. King at Lasky.
freighter, stowaway, Chinaman with a hatchet, a monkey, and a girl.
sounds like a doozy.
well, it paid for my house. You two sit there.
don't look at the lens. Keep your lips closed when we kiss.
wait, we're kissing? And roll.
all right, Gil's a charming gambler on the run from the law.
you're a showgirl down on her luck.
not a lead, but, you know, the funny one in the chorus.
the pony. - Is that what they're called?
action!
is this cab taken? It sure is, and I'm the one who took it.
don't turn your head so far. - Do you mind?
we're headed the same way. - Give him some lip, blossom.
keep your face out. Ooh, you've got your nerve. Why, I oughta...
and policeman outside. He's looking, he's looking.
what are you gonna do, Johnny Diamonds?
they're after you. Policeman.
policeman. Policeman.
and he's gone.
what did I do to deserve that?
what didn't you? - Make sure he gets the message.
cabbie, St. Patrick's and step on it.
I'm late for church.
would you tell him to turn off that ticker?
you don't care what the market is doing?
this is meant to be a retreat.
then I won't take up much of your time.
why would you take up any of it?
because we have an enemy in common.
you're not a member of this club.
I'm not a member of any club.
my name is Enoch Thompson. You may have heard of me or not.
in any case, the attorney general and I have had dealings, but those dealings have come to an end.
and the nature of these dealings would be?
circumvention of the Volstead Act.
should I continue?
I make no excuses for myself.
I'm a businessman, a small businessman, and I'm sure you can understand that.
but for Harry Daugherty, the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, to be involved with... to in fact be the head of...
a large criminal conspiracy, something is wrong with the country, Mr. Secretary. Something is very wrong.
your sense of patriotism is offended, Mr. Thompson?
isn't yours?
Daugherty is nothing but a shabby little huckster.
I've always thought so. - The whole lot of them are.
that's what democracy gets you...
bandits fighting over a cut of the loot. The income tax.
sanctioned robbery with no constitutional basis.
and Prohibition?
a child's idea of morality. I don't envy your position.
but we... I hope you'll allow me to say "we..."
can do something about that and help each other in the bargain.
you have the power to arrest George Remus, the biggest bootlegger in the country with direct, ongoing ties to Daugherty and the men that work for him.
arrest Remus and force Harry to show his hand.
a man doesn't indict himself.
then you'll have something on him to use when you need it.
that's just as valuable, maybe more.
and that would be your bargain? - No.
your distillery. Overholt.
it would stick in my craw for the government to tell me what I could or couldn't do with my own property, no matter how trivial it seemed.
but that's how I am.
it's the little things that eat at me.
and you would rectify this how?
I'd run it for you.
it's a field I have some expertise in.
you wouldn't know anything about it. We'd never speak.
all you'd see is the money.
and there's always a way to hide that.
is that a yes?
even a perhaps?
you brought some color to my day, Mr. Thompson.
and I do appreciate that.
Yes, Mr. Mellon? - There's no cause for a scene, but this gentleman is an interloper.
please be ready to call the police in the event that he doesn't leave the premises immediately.
I'll see myself out.
it doesn't make sense...
a pony... when there's no telling what the future holds.
what does it matter? She'll enjoy it now.
could always take the shed and turn it into a proper barn.
who's going to tend to him?
it'll be good for Teddy. Learn how to look after an animal.
not that clearing out stalls is... - Please.
something wrong?
just...
you mustn't talk that way about what's good and isn't.
why not?
because they're just words and they don't mean anything anymore.
would you teach me how to drive?
right now?
no.
after.
and with the added bonus of steam...
your only regret will be that I didn't show up sooner.
should I put you down for two, ma'am, or just one?
one'll be fine. And that's how you close them, boys!
swell job, Ralph. One thing, though.
make sure you mention the enamel grip, which is a lot softer on those delicate hands.
all right, who's next, huh?
George, how 'bout it? - Yeah, come on, Georgie.
Yeah, come on. Strut your stuff. - Come on, George.
I'm not feeling my best, Mr. Gulliver.
I haven't been sleeping. - Aw!
a good night's rest and a sensible breakfast. A salesman travels on his stomach.
what I like is that Malt-O-Meal. Phil, you be the customer.
Okey-doke. - Come on, George, shake off those cobwebs.
good morning. - Ain't you gonna ring the bell?
Yes.
well? - Oh, I'm sorry.
the bell's on the fritz. You'll have to knock.
may I help you? Good morning, sir. My name...
sir? Why, how dare you?
can't you see that I'm a perky little housewife?
no wonder he's hardly making any sales.
Yes, ma'am. My name is George Mueller.
I am with the Electric Iron Comp...
the Farraday Electric Iron Company.
well, if you don't know who you work for, then why should I care?
I misspoke.
I'm sorry.
ma'am, I am selling a product that can save you hours of backbreaking work.
is it a steam-powered dildo?
because, oh, my arm sure gets tired.
terrible. - No, ma'am.
it's an iron.
and if you'll allow me to demonstrate...
this is our newest model.
it has heat set... three heat settings and an enamel handle, which is very comfortable on the hands.
this tip, as you can see...
what did you say your name was? George Mueller, ma'am.
and are you married?
I am. - Well, Mr. Mueller, if you screw as poorly as you pitch, you really should be...
selling dildos because your wife could use a...
somebody stop him!
George, George, be reasonable!
Hey, come on, it was a gag!
George, please, calm down.
Ah! Somebody call the cops!
what?
I am Sheik Hous bin Farten.
what? I come from the mysterious East.
when my eyes go wide, I am irresistible.
come to me.
no. - Come to me in Araby.
Silence! Silence!
none may laugh at bin Farten.
what?
what's that smell?
Oh. Hello.
no, don't...
I said drink it. Don't blow on it.
I didn't know you were in town.
Ooh. - Just thought I'd drop by the oasis.
have a drink. We're celebrating.
bill's gonna be a movie star. - I don't know about that.
well, she tested for Clifton King and he loved her.
and now we're all boiled!
Congratulations. - Thanks.
I haven't met the sheik.
Oh, this is Gilbert Longacre. - He's a movie star, too.
I've got a picture coming out next month.
he fights a monkey with a hatchet. - A Chinaman.
you fight a monkey with a Chinaman? You need to start drinking.
I'll get you started, sir. - What?
I said I'll get you started. - What did you call me?
uh, sir?
Gilbert, why don't you take that pig-in-shit smirk and that bedsheet and get the fuck out of here?
take her with you.
why don't you watch your language?
or what?
or you'll wish you had... sir.
little fucking interloper. - Gus, you need to calm down.
he's...
Jesus.
he's not worth it, Gus. Gus, stop it!
Gus, Gus, stop it! Stop it!
Gus! Stop...
Gus! Stop!
stop it! Gus!
get... get back! I am not kidding!
vi, give me a hand. Come on.
I- Is my nose broken? It's hard to tell.
you have to leave. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you're gonna get sued by the studio!
how do you like that? - He will pay for everything.
won't you?
okay, Vi, Vi, could you... could you just...
could you just please... - No, I'm not gonna leave you here.
I will be fine, all right?
just... just get him some ice, all right?
okay? - You have money for a taxi, right?
Jesus.
what's it about? What?
the picture.
a gangster and a showgirl.
I don't like this arrangement.
I don't like looking the other way.
I don't like not asking questions I'm not supposed to hear the answers to...
what you're up to, who's here, who's not.
I don't like you lying to me. - I never lied about...
not telling... it's the same goddamn thing.
I don't like it! - I don't ask you either.
I'd say that's mighty white of me, wouldn't you?
I can take care of you.
you won't have to worry about anything.
I'm not worried, Gus.
how long do you think this is going to last?
don't you think I'm any good? The business you're in.
you don't, do you?
there's nothing you can count on.
look at your friend. You wanna wind up like her?
leave Vi out of it. - It happens all the time.
people just want something new.
in a year from now, two years...
I have a father, okay? He's in Newburgh.
he thinks a fist is a good way to end an argument and I don't live there anymore.
that's how you see me? - That's how you sound.
I'm on my own, Gus.
I have been for years.
I like it.
and...
go on, say it.
you're no fun this way.
and what do you want from me?
I just want you...
to be my gangster.
husband. - Ah! Dear.
I, uh... excuse me. What are you doing?
we need to leave here as soon as possible.
Why? - I can carry Abigail and two cases.
husband...
all you will need to do is bundle up Chester.
husband, what has happened?
I... at work, an incident.
he... a bad person.
and the other event. Where... where would you like to go?
I'm open to any state except New Jersey and New York and Illinois, obviously.
but aside from those, we can discuss it... - Shh!
you stop!
wait.
drink this. - I...
go on. Do.
what's this?
the whiskey for Mr. O'Banion.
I make it all day while you don't come home.
14 bottles. You did this by yourself?
also three for us. - Us?
aquavit.
when I was girl, I make for Papa.
some orange peel, too, for flavor.
no. No, no, no. We're not supposed to drink any...
not to drink, to sell.
sell where? - On Kedzie Boulevard.
to Norwegian people there.
what? Syttende Mai is tomorrow, the day to celebrate when Norway become free of the Danes.
we sell the aquavit for the extra money it will bring.
it's not what Mr. O'Banion needs for, so no problems.
darling, I...
we do this so you don't worry yourself about losing your job.
we make more, we sell more.
we stay.
there is no need for us to be going anywhere.
we buy a house right here...
hmm. - In Cicero.
when did you get in?
last night.
late.
I need this room.
the roofers have to inspect the ceiling.
I told you I ain't paying for that.
I took a loan, Charles. You needn't concern yourself.
why are you here, anyway?
I got business with A. R.
and Nucky Thompson.
what of it?
when are you meeting? - Tonight.
we got a dinner at Babette's.
you belittle my business, break bread with my enemies.
who the fuck you think you are?
come on, I'll give you a nice, hard fuck like you like.
I want you out.
I need a shower first. - Out of the business.
here's a check.
4500
the fuck I'm gonna do with a check?
stick it up your ass for all I care.
better yet, let Nucky do it for you. Whoa, what the fuck you doing?
Dr. Mason. - Hello.
did you drive here?
no, I was... I was waiting for you.
I need your help with something and it's rather delicate.
too delicate to discuss inside?
I would like to ask you to help me obtain a diaphragm.
is this what the Shearer woman wanted to speak to you about?
Yes.
actually, I suppose I'd need two.
two?
one for her...
and one for me.
it was nearly midnight when I felt the pain.
the midwife was called, and together we passed the night.
hours later, after my ordeal, she placed him at my breast.
it was just after dawn.
the whole world looked brand-new.
do you have children, Mr. Rosetti?
two girls. My little princesses.
beauties just like their mother. They're the lights of your life.
the sun rises and sets.
one day they're little, the next...
my grandson...
he's all I have left.
Mr. Harrow, have you met Mr. Rosetti?
I have not.
a pleasure.
Tonino. - How do you do?
I've restocked the bar.
and Tommy is asleep? - Yes.
that will be all.
you use him to scare away the mice?
Mr. Harrow was a friend of my son.
are you familiar with Babette's?
supper club on the boardwalk. I ate there with Nucky before our falling-out.
have you fallen out? I hadn't realized.
he'll be dining there this evening with Mr. Rothstein.
you don't say.
I'm not sure what time, but that shouldn't be hard to ascertain.
why are you telling me this?
I thought perhaps you'd like to surprise him.
you have a phone call.
am I supposed to guess? The gentleman would not reveal himself, but he said you would be relieved to hear his voice.
who is this? - Mr. Thompson.
that's who you called, isn't it? This is Andrew Mellon.
sir, what can I do for you?
a few days from now, Treasury agents in Cincinnati will arrest George Remus for multiple violations of the Volstead Act, including the purchase of government liquor permits from a close associate of the Attorney General of the United States.
are you referring to Jess Smith? - In exchange,
I expect the Overholt Distillery to be operational within one month and generating a profit the month thereafter.
I assure you that will be the case.
henceforth, you will not contact me.
is that understood? - Yes.
then our intercourse is concluded.
am I allowed in? - I lost an earring.
which?
these hummingbirds you gave me.
I'll buy you new ones. I like these.
and who are you supposed to be?
huh? - Stand up.
like it?
I don't know. Yes.
for the picture?
just felt like being someone else for a little bit.
who?
where you from, Nadine?
newburgh, New York. No kidding?
God's honest. Ever been to Atlantic City before?
first time.
and what do you think? They told me it was wicked.
they were right.
am I under arrest?
you're being freed.
it's a single premium annuity.
again, please, in English.
guaranteed income the first of each month for the rest of your life.
we already made up, Gus, okay?
that's not what it's about. Then what's the gag?
call it a mystery.
I don't need... - Need anyone's help.
I envy that.
so what you do with this money and who you do it with...
it's nobody's business but your own.
are you saying goodbye?
I'm saying, "Hello... Nadine Beckenbauer. Hello and good luck."
you know, if you change your name, you might go pretty far.
I will put on a different pair.
unlike steam irons, aquavit sells itself.
we were gonna go down to Nell's if you're interested.
I'm heading home. Osso buco tonight.
demos was short. I got someone on it. He's good for it.
need anything else?
sounds like you got it all under control.
see you tomorrow, then. Love to Mae and the boy.
freak show tonight...
and this gentleman...
he's trustworthy?
he's a Chink. I ain't inviting him over for Christmas dinner.
$50, 000 apiece is a lot of money.
sell it on the street, make 10 times that.
if you wanna make extra, sure.
we'll make sure we could... - Thompson!
Mr. Thompson! Aw, shit.
Baxter, you old so-and-so.
how's tricks? - Gangbusters, I tell ya.
I'm selling radios now.
Oh, aren't you going to introduce me?
george Baxter, meet Arnold Rothstein, Charlie Luciano, and Billie Kent. Charmed, I'm sure.
well, don't make up your mind so soon.
go ahead.
no reason for both of us to suffer. Don't malinger, now.
so you're out of the cutlery business now?
well, there's a lot more silver in the Radio Corporation of America.
how about RCA, the official radio of the world's playground?
strictly on the QT, I know a charming lass who's very close to Mr. David Sarnoff himself.
and I bet... I am certain...
here we go.
it's a game of chance. It's a game of skill.
are you okay?
what happened?
the Blue-Eyed Angel 'Even the weight of my sin cannot overpower this joy.' Eugon Metcalfe
a School Day of the Dead
put your heart at ease and speak your mind.
your words will reach unto God.
yes...
sir...
here I am called 'Father'.
please, Father! Let the Drama Club perform 'The Blue-Eyed Angel'!
you're the club president, aren't you.
Yuko's suicide was an awful thing.
it was.
that's why we want to put it on!
for her, as the last thing she wrote...
...and for us.
excuse me.
Hello?
I can't talk now.
I'm with the Principal!
Really?
I'm sure God has heard your prayers.
thank you very much, sir!
that's 'Father'.
coming to see me?
sir!
thank you!
Tezuka Yuzuru, third principal...
just date of birth.
march 18th, 1901.
accessing.
password Error.
they wouldn't use a birth date for a password like this!
try the next principal anyway.
Hello?
Hello, Haruko?
where are you?
what do you mean, you're busy? The meeting's started!
who was it?
Oh, no!
we're late!
this is more important!
number four...
born 1925...
may 1st.
I see you!
look who's here!
what are you doing?
breaking into student records on the school database.
that's hacking! It's illegal!
my future depends on it.
Mr. Nishida caught Haruko coming out of a 'love hotel'.
Nishida? Oh, no!
he could put something in my file and stop me getting into a good university!
your dad's on the Board of Directors. he might know the password!
he just runs the Art Gallery. he wouldn't know that!
anyway...
...ta- da! Permission to perform!
What?!
and we cast Metcalfe, the male lead.
one of the guys in the Club. So what?
Mr. Thornhill's going to play him.
you're kidding!
he asked if he could.
what!
Oh, Sumiko!
even the weight of my sin cannot overpower this joy!'
accessing
access Granted
what's that?
not student files...
numbers 29 '?
that's in the bible...
but what are those numbers?
sold out', it says...
I've seen this before... it was on Yuko's disk for 'The Blue-Eyed Angel'!
there was some stuff at the end, and 'Numbers' was there, too.
what's going on?
we're coming.
everyone's waiting.
Hurry!
why were you in there?
thanks for being in our play, sir.
my pleasure. Are there always so many of you?
yes... it makes us feel better about having to study.
it looks like fun.
OK, everyone, listen up!
I'm sure you've all heard by now.
we've finally been given permission to perform 'The Blue-Eyed Angel'...
... the final work of Yamazaki Yuko.
mr Thornhill, if you would take the role of Metcalfe...
of course.
we don't have much rehearsal time, but let's do this for Yuko.
the Blue-Eyed Angel'...
this is a school legend, a tragedy that actually happened 80 years ago.
Sumiko, a music teacher and daughter of the man who founded the school...
fell in love with Eugon Metcalfe, an art teacher brought from Germany.
a tragedy?
I guess a frosh wouldn't have heard the story... it was adultery.
Metcalfe had a family in Germany.
people were scandalized, so they were forbidden to meet.
but the obstacles put in their way didn't stop Sumiko's love for him.
the more the barriers, the greater the love.
to show she still loved him she'd play his favorite music...
...Debussy's Clair de Lune, everyday on the piano in the auditorium.
but one day the music stopped.
Why?
her father, the first principal, had the piano moved to the chapel.
she still played, but he couldn't hear from over in the Arts building.
he thought she'd stopped loving him and vanished...
...Ieaving a last picture for her: 'The Blue-Eyed Angel'.
that picture in the Art Gallery?
Yes.
what happened to Sumiko?
when she found out he'd left, she threw herself off the roof.
just like Yuko?
that's why they didn't want us performing it...
to atone to his daughter, the principal put the piano back in the auditorium...
... and had its legs nailed to the floor so it couldn't be moved again.
that's the piano in the auditorium now?
Yes.
mr Thornhill?
what's with him?
I'll go see.
look at Mayumi run!
let's rehearse the scenes without Sumiko or Metcalfe.
you like that painting?
I do, too.
I should've asked before I came in...
that's all right.
I'm Yuki, the gallery director. Are you a student here?
I'm transferring in tomorrow.
excuse me.
hey...
was that you playing Clair de Lune on the piano?
no.
sir?
mr Thornhill?
Debussy'...
from your 'Metcalfe'.
dad! You don't go off and take a bath when company's here!
ms lzumi 's not 'company'
still...
thank you, Machiko.
I hear your school bought an early Boulanger in Paris.
I wouldn't know.
she knows nothing about art.
I asked them to do that.
we have an English art teacher. Sometimes he helps us out in Paris.
mr Thornhill?
Yeah.
that was Boulanger's best period. 'Bathers' and 'Moonlight Song'...
I've been waiting for a chance.
moonlight Song' made you want to be an artist.
I'm sorry.
we're probably boring you.
so you've seen Dad's paintings?
sure.
I never have.
I got rid of them all. That was a long, long time ago.
by the way, last week I went to the restaurant you designed in Ginza.
Oh?
that's a fine picture you put on the wall as you go in.
you've taught me well.
I'm humbled.
excuse me.
are you finished?
I'll leave you two young people alone.
jerk!
morning!
where did you get to yesterday?
I followed Mr Thornhill to the auditorium, and Clair de Lune was on the piano...
...with h 'from your "Metcalfe"'on it!
guess what!
what?
remember I told you about Yuko's disk?
I found it!
Numbers'?
Yeah, but something else, too!
I'll show you later.
ms Ono... come with me.
bag inspection.
we'll go on ahead.
this is the chapel.
Kouyama's a new student. Make room.
in our class?
good morning, everyone.
we begin the mass.
we'll sing hymn 312.
shove down.
did he take it?
special days, special measures.
I was ready.
the novel Kokoro...
... involves a woman and two men...
... who of course...
... come into conflict over her.
but it's also a story of friendship.
I m sure some of you have read this book already.
it's the search for the self...
the new guy's just asked me out! Look in the fox's mouth.
...a novel that takes up a number of different questions.
let's read from it first.
Yes, sir.
l always called him Sensei...'
I want to talk to you. Kouyama '...and that is what I call him here.
l do this not from discretion...
...but because this way seems most natural to me.
when he comes to memory, it is Sensei I wish to call him.
lt is the same when I take up my brush to write.'
that's a pretty poor love letter!
lt was in Kamakura that I met Sensei...'
give me those.
l love you!'
do not speak. Opening our hearts will only increase our suffering.
l have a wife at home.'
what I want is truth!
speak truly to me!'
l cannot.'
l play that song every day for you...
...hoping it may ease your suffering even a little.
lt was you who left Clair de tune on the piano, wasn't it.'
Yes.
even the weight of my sin cannot overpower this joy!'
sorry... could you cut there?
mr Thornhill, you're being a little too restrained.
in spite of what you're saying, you're as passionate as she is.
before you say "the weight of my sin cannot overpower this joy!"
...I think you should throw your arms around him.
I like it the way it is.
restraint in a situation like this is more sincere.
mr Kurabayashi?
I don't know about 'sincere'...
... but a 42 year-old as passionate as a younger woman is hard to believe.
age has nothing to do with the obstacle of his being married!
if that's true, I don't understand Metcalfe.
you wouldn't be passionate?
no.
even though your wife's dead?
that's right.
sorry.
from Scene 18.
Yuki, I love you!'
no, Sir! We're teacher and student!'
so what? Love has no borders!'
I wish it did. You can cross borders.
he's handsome, but he's straight.
he'd never touch a student.
and that drives you crazy!
Oh yeah...
I can't show you Yuko's disk today after all.
Oh, your date...
sorry.
it's pouring!
haruko...you can't show up soaking wet for a date.
thank you!
see you.
Bye.
Yuko's disk says that Metcalfe was murdered here at the school!
Bye.
what's wrong?
I'm hoping it'll ease off.
here.
no, thanks.
it's OK.
I'm fine.
take it.
no?
see you tomorrow, then.
compared to Metcalfe, I find you harder to understand!
a man who wears a wedding ring when his wife's dead!
one day you'll understand.
I don't understand, and I don't want to!
a red umbrella found at the scene had your name on it.
I lent it to her.
that means you're the last person here at the school who saw Ms Ono
was she going to meet anyone?
Yes. A friend.
who?
the new student, Kouyama.
is this a formal investigation?
uh, no...
wasn't haruko's death an accident?
don't take this too seriously. We just want to get our facts straight.
thank you very much for your help.
goodbye.
so it wasn't an accident?
sure it was.
even so, they want to know what happened.
what did we talk about?
before she left.
... we should have talked about something more important!
there were so many things!
I heard what happened.
I see.
are you OK?
Yeah.
I'd like to go home with you, but there's an emergency board meeting
I'll be fine.
shall I go with her?
that would be a great help.
do you remember the last thing you said to your wife?
Hm?
what was it, I wonder...
maybe it's like you said...
... nothing important.
what did you want to say
I'm sure Ono understood...
... the important things you wanted her to know.
I wonder...
some things have to be said to be understood.
did the police talk to you, Mayumi?
Yeah.
I mentioned Yuko's disk to them.
but when I went to look for it, I couldn't find it anywhere.
it's weird.
who did this?!
who put these here?!
tell me! Was it you?! Was it you?!
who did this?!
sir!
whatever's wrong?!
mr Thornhill!
are you all right? Mr Thornhill!
you saw haruko, didn't you?
no.
what did you talk about?
all rise!
numbers 29
in the seventh month, on the first day, you shall have an holy convocation.
you shall do no servile work.
lt is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.
this way, please.
an investigation of the scene suggests perhaps it wasn't an accident.
what do you mean by that?
this:
... the vehicle struck Ono Haruko from behind, then stopped...
...reversed at high speed...
...and struck her again.
Oh, dear!
we're treating this as a murder investigation.
we'd be very grateful for the cooperation of everyone here.
of course. We'll help all we can.
a student named Kouyama hideto recently transferred into this school...
I'm his homeroom teacher.
what about him?
we checked the record of Ono Haruko's cellphone calls.
it seems she was talking to him just before she was hit.
Yuki Machiko, the last person to see Ms Ono here...
... said they'd arranged to meet.
we'd appreciate it if you'd call him in to see us...
text Sorry to keep you so long.
thank you all very much.
you're welcome.
Oh, Mr Kurabayashi...you're the Drama Club advisor, aren't you.
Yes.
do you know about a floppy disk left by a girl who committed suicide?
you mean Yamazaki Yuko? I'm afraid I don't.
it doesn't matter, then.
we'll be seeing you.
I have to go.
you really don't know anything?
as I told the detectives...
... I was late for our appointment, so I didn't see Ms Ono.
that's all.
I see.
why, sir?
that blue rose you put on the altar at her funeral was very moving.
excuse me.
sir...
Oh, it's you...
about today...
...I'm very, very sorry.
I love you, sir!
you don't know anything about me.
I play that song every day for you...
...hoping it may ease your suffering even a little.
it was you who left Clair de Lune on the piano, wasn't it.
if I lose you, I lose everything.
before you vanish forever...
... tell me...
...to die.
sir?
you don't understand!
the Blue-Eyed Angel' is not some beautiful love story!
that legend of Sumiko and Metcalfe...
...hides a horrible truth!
this is Machiko. I can't come to the phone, so please leave a message.
even the weight of my sin cannot overpower this joy.

hello.
did something happen to Machiko?
no, I realize it's rather late... it's Drama Club business.
Oh, I see...
well, I'll be going.
ms lzumi, have you been with Dad all evening?
Yes.
you're sure?
what's the matter?
you'll embarrass Mr Kurabayashi.
excuse me. I shouldn't be leaving a girl of her age alone so often.
sir!
great, huh?
Yeah.
good night.
good night.
Machiko? It's Mayumi's mother. She's not home yet.
is she with you? Call me, please.
meet me in the auditorium. Metcalfe was murdered!
Metcalfe was murdered here at the school!
Where's Mayumi?!
No! No! Mayumi!
No! Let me go!
ms Yuki...
...exactly who is this 'Metcalfe' mentioned in your e-mail?
ms Yuki!
I'll explain.
mr Kurabayashi... this is an investigation.
I'd like to hear it from her.
she's lost two close friends. Please understand that.
Yuki...go home.
she wasn't playing that one.
it wasn't Debussy.
what do you mean?
I was the one who left the Debussy music Mayumi found.
you did?
she wouldn't have played it if she'd known it was me.
but that day someone had put different music here.
it made me feel sad.
a weird melody like that didn't suit Mayumi!
it wasn't an accident!
...Haruko, and Yuko...
...were murdered!
come in!
what's wrong?
something's going on!
what?
someone at this school murdered Mayumi, Haruko and Yuko!
those were accidents!
dad!
you're tired.
keep away from the school for a while.
do you know something?
what do you mean?
I'm not going anywhere! I'm going to find who did this!
sorry.
it's just that I'm worried about you.
how many girls are you going to kill?!
you killed Yuko!
it was you! You! You!
let go!
calm down!
are you all right?
what's this?
mr Thornhill!
mr Thornhill killed himself.
so... you were first on the scene again!
is it true Mr Thornhill was the killer?
go back to class.
he apparently left a note saying he was acting out of remorse.
he got Yuko pregnant, got tired of her, and killed her when she got angry.
Haruko and Mayurni found that out from a disk Yuko left.
they threatened to tell, so he killed them.
you don't look like you believe it.
what are you hiding?
we have class.
mr Kurabayashi! We don't believe that note.
there's a monster loose in this school.
cancel the play'?!
our lead actors are all dead. We have to.
that's all the more reason to go on!
No!
Sir...do you know something?
that's not it.
then why?
you won't tell me, will you.
first you must pray. Our Lord Jesus will save your soul.
we want to perform 'The Blue-Eyed Angel'.
this morning Mr Kurabayashi informed me it had been canceled.
if you give permission, we can perform it. Please!
all right. I'll speak to Mr Kurabayashi.
you're at my place.
how did I get here?
I was at the Gallery. I saw you going into the storeroom.
it looked like trouble, so I went in and found you there.
you saved me?
maybe.
Thanks.
I'm Yuko's twin.
our parents divorced when we were two so we only saw each other twice a year.
no other siblings.
she sent me...
... a picture of herself with him.
then when she got pregnant...
... he wouldn't see her.
I wanted to pay him back!
mr Thornhill wasn't the murderer.
he wasn't?
the killer knew about them, and didn't want it known...
... that Metcalfe was murdered.
Metcalfe? The art teacher from years ago?
I think Yuko found out...
... that Metcalfe didn't leave because of his affair with Sumiko...
... but that someone here killed him.
so she wrote a play about it...
I think so.
the clue was the 'Numbers' code on the Blue-Eyed Angel' disk.
Numbers'?
remember what those men in black hoods were saying?
only that it sounded like they were selling paintings...
how do you know that?
Yuko told me...
... to find this picture and that disk if anything happened to her.
this is.
what?
ln the seventh month, on the first day you shall have an holy convocation.
ye shall do no servile work.
lt is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.
numbers 29-1' was the code for this picture!
the starting price was 134 million yen.
if it was sold...
... why is it still here?
that might be why Metcalfe was murdered!
what do you mean?
maybe we can catch the killer!
Kouyama! Help us stage The Blue-Eyed Angel'!
I need your help!
mr Kurabayashi is against us doing the play.
but I'm not giving up!
if we don't do it, we'll never know who killed Yuko, Haruko and Mayumi.
none of us knew about Yuko and Mr Thornhill.
so who's the killer?
I don't know.
but we have one clue...
let's do it.
Yeah, why not?
let's do it!
I'm sorry to take your time. I know you're busy.
not at all. What can I do for you?
I'd like you to keep away...
... from the Drama Club play at the Spring Festival.
I certainly wasn't expecting that...
I'm a little busy...
mr Yuki!
tell me...
... what happens in the basement.
excuse me.
lf I lose you, I lose everything.
before you vanish forever, open your heart to me!
the truth from you will save me.
the truth from you...
the truth from you...
80th Annual Spring Festival
I'm looking forward to next year's festival, too.
I hope you won't be disappointed.
anything wrong?
no, nothing.
you insist on coming?
it's my daughter's big day.
the Drama Club performance of 'The Blue-Eyed Angel' will soon begin.
please take your seats.
here we go.
no matter what happens, keep on going till the end.
thank you for waiting.
the name of today's Tezuka Academy Spring Festival Drama is changed...
...from 'The Blue-Eyed Angel' to 'School Day of the Dead'
it is to the memories of Yamazaki Yuko, Ono haruko, Yanagida Mayumi.
and Mr David Thornhill that this performance is dedicated.
we hope you enjoy it.
I, Eugon Metcalfe, left wife and child in Germany in the winter of 1920...
and first trod the earth of this distant land.
in that winter, separated from my husband and torn from my daughter...
... I, Tezuka Surniko, was alone.
one day we met, as if led on by fate.
what can Sumiko be thinking of?!
divorced and back in this house! I don't care whose daughter she is!
now she wants to see her daughter?!
I won't stand for it! I'll give her a piece of my mind!
a month I've been back...
... and nothing but the piano will soothe my heart.
I love you!
do not speak. Opening our hearts will only increase our suffering.
I have a wife at home.
what I want is truth! Speak truly to me!
I cannot.
I play that song every day for you...
...hoping it may ease your suffering even a little.
it was you who left Clair de Lune on the piano, wasn't it?
even the weight of my sin cannot overpower this joy!
mr Metcalfe has a wife and child in Germany!
adultery is a mortal sin!
and they're teachers!
they defile their holy vocation!
and Miss Sumiko is divorced! And he's almost as old as her father!
it's unnatural!
miss hashimoto, that's going too far!
Shh! Someone's coming!
this won't do! Now the students know!
should we warn them?
Yes, before Miss Tomoko finds out.
Yes. If she finds out, Miss Sumiko will be turned out.
and Mr Metcalfe, too!
unable to bear the weight of my conscience, I admitted...
...to this forbidden love.
then I heard it...the devil!
Metcalfe! You must serve us if you do not want to be exposed.
what do you want?
paint these!
what's this?
Metcalfe! You are a genius!
no one will know these are copies!
we'll hang them in the Gallery and sell the originals...
I will have more gold than I can spend!
even the weight of my sin cannot overpower this joy!
134 million yen!
15O million yen!
180 million yen!
200 million yen!
250 million yen!
300 million yen!
400 million yen!
500 million yen!
600 million yen!
7OO million yen!
I cannot do any more!
please! No more!
you are devils!
fool! We are not devils.
the real devil is there!
no traitor may see me and live!
Metcalfe! You!
die!
die! Die! Die!
do I really have to go?
don't worry. We'll improvise.
thank you.
mr Kurabayashi...
dad?
sorry to keep you.
well...
No!
you put me to a lot of trouble over one little disk.
how girls will talk! Didn't I tell you?
stop that gossiping!'
are you all right?
you know, do you?
I gave up on Mr Nishida.
the police found out when Miss Ono was run over.
and he failed with you in the storeroom, too.
yanagida Mayumi, though... I did that, if I do say so myself.
she didn't die right away.
her feet kept twitching long after the light smashed her face in.
I tingle, just thinking about it!
did you kill Yuko, too?!
a bold, beautiful girl...
her boyfriend Thornhill told her the truth about Metcalfe's murder...
... and she threatened me!
Thornhill was weak. I didn't know what to do with him.
but Kouyama showed up at exactly the right time.
he was a surprise. I never dreamed Yamazaki Yuko had a twin brother!
you did very well to follow up on the clues they gave you.
but none of them knew about the dealing in pictures.
why did you have to kill them all?
once someone finds one secret, they want to know more.
80 years ago, we dealt with a traitor the counterfeiter Eugon Metcalfe.
and now there's another Metcalfe:
your father, Yuki Shozo.
you're lying!
I don't believe a word of this!
Aw, isn't that sweet!
did you know your father painted all the old masters in our Gallery?
he forges paintings to slake the desire of those who covet!
you're awful!
you' re not human!
Yes, I am!
you said it yourself!
even the weight of my sin cannot overpower this joy!
now, if you don't mind, you die.
stop!
sir!
mr Yuki's told us everything.
he has?!
what did I tell you?
he did everything I said.
no.
I've got news for you. The pictures in the Gallery are genuine.
he deceived you and auctioned off the fakes.
what did you say?!
sir!
are you all right?
did you kill Yuko?!
Yep.
no, Kouyama!
fools!
No!
are you all right?
I'm fine.
Nishida, too.
I'll wait upstairs.
all right.
I'm due onstage.
Yuki...you too.
don't hate your father.
as a student he copied a painting because he liked it...
... and Tezuka blackmailed him.
but I want you to understand...
... the pictures were saved because your father was here.
they're all genuine.
everyone's waiting.
isn't this what you wanted?
not content to press herself tightly against me...
...she licks my toenails and fingers!
Oh, Linda! What a bulldog you are!
such beauty is a crime!
the world will never allow our love!
why did you vanish from my sight?
father!
I will not hate my father for the truth he has confessed.
the truth is what saved my soul.
may it save my father's as well.
and now I will end it all, and become one with love itself.
forgive me!
it's snowing!
just as it was on the day we met...
...as if to cover over our sins.
Hello?
it's me.
how are you?
good. Are you OK?
what do you mean?
he's leaving today.
Yeah.
he's going to work in a girls' school.
he'll be all right there.
forget him and come with me.
you live in Nagano! I hate cold!
I see.
take care, then.
you, too.
what are you doing?
where are you going?
South.
in my next life I'll be your first love.
look for me.
OK.
I'll find you.
I will.
I'll make sure I find you.
help me!
semper Fortis.
mom, you said if I came over we could watch a movie!
no, I said if you finished your homework.
come on, it's too hard! - I know, I know, but I swear, you will use it for everything.
really. Especially if you want to be a doctor or a lawyer.
I don't want to be either of those.
okay. What do you want to be?
a fashion designer.
semper fortis.
always... something.
Oh. Must be your father.
already?
Hey.
Hello, Todd.
thanks for watching her. - Anytime.
come on, kiddo. Let's go.
see you, Megan.
Thanks, mom.
I'm sorry about the movie.
maybe we can do it this weekend.
I can't. I'm going to Boston with dad and Kate.
well, then, um...
next weekend.
okay.
let me get this straight. This tall? You're sure?
man, she took a real beating.
then some soulless bastard dumps her out here.
well, that's if she was dumped.
a guy walking his dog came across the body - and Mr. Meth Head over there going through her pockets. - What do you want me to say?!
Hey, settle down.
liver temp and rigor puts T. O.D.
between 5: 00 and 7: 00 PM yesterday.
no obvious fatal trauma.
no strangulation. No stab wounds.
nice compound fracture of the tibia, though.
how hard would you have to hit someone to do that?
never underestimate the power of meth.
detective Morris, good to see you.
Dr. Hunt. Nice tennis shoes. Very C. S.A.
crime scene appropriate.
you get an I. D. on this girl yet?
no. My newfound friend dookie over here isn't gonna...
tell us anything till he lands back on planet earth.
well, this looks like it could be a handprint.
I'm thinking she and dookie came out here to get high.
he tries to take advantage. She fights back.
well, it's what's on the inside that counts, right, doctor?
I'll let you know what I get out of Rocket Man.
bud was almost in a good mood.
his wife let him back in the house.
what is with those shoes anyway?
I'm not wearing heels. So?
well, that's a first.
maybe my mind was on other things.
Lacey is going to Boston this weekend...
with Todd and Kate.
he didn't even consult me.
a whole weekend with his new girlfriend, who, by the way, just also happens to be my...
your boss.
good morning, Dr. Murphy.
I understand we've got a dumped body.
we're not sure if it was dumped or not.
great. This area's supposed to be family friendly.
I already have the city tourist board calling me.
and here I was, concerned about a woman who was beaten to death. Hmm.
you know that for a fact? - Not yet.
well, until you do, I'm consulting.
send me the X-rays as soon as you have 'em.
go, team.
okay, folks, I have a brief statement.
the body of a woman was found this morning.
we have no I. D. at this time.
who was she, dookie?
I don't know who she is.
I already told you.
who was she?
I don't know.
I don't know! I don't know! I don't know!
knock it off. Knock it off. Knock it off!
you know what I think?
I think you two were getting high.
things got out of hand.
you dragged her off the path into those godforsaken woods.
you took her money, and you beat her to death.
No! I told you, when I tripped is when I first saw her body, but she was dead already.
is that before or after you shot up?
Jane Doe, approximately 30 years old.
no obvious cause of death.
severe abrasions on the right side.
compound fracture of the left tibia.
how big was the guy who did this?
if it's the guy from the scene, about Ethan's size with the added bonus of meth.
uh, meth gives you superhuman strength.
it does not make you stronger.
it just makes you feel like you are.
it blocks the brain's pain receptors so the muscles operate beyond fatigue.
and she has a tattoo on her left wrist of four horses.
of the apocalypse?
four little horses, and you go apocalypse?
well, horses are scary, and there's four of 'em.
those don't look like badass, scary horses to me.
those are nice horses.
horses are never nice.
if you don't mind, there is something written beneath the horses.
thank you.
and she has glitter on her lips.
presumably from her lipstick.
are you sure she wasn't a user?
there's no evidence of xerostomia.
Why? - There's white powder under her nails.
is that cocaine?
huh. Maybe Bud was right, and our victim and her attacker were doing drugs together.
or not.
forensics found a D. N.A. match in Codis to the bloody handprint.
we have a new suspect, sort of.
sort of?
Zoe Brant. She's doing four to seven years in County.
how do you kill someone if you're already behind bars?
serving four to seven for nearly beating your drug dealer to death.
but good behavior got you, uh, horse therapy at Grass Hill Stables two days a week.
Yeah, so?
Oh, my God. That's Bryn.
does Bryn have a last name?
Yeah. Bryn Walker. She started the program.
what happened to her?
you tell us. That's your blood on her shirt.
wait. You think I did this? I got cut yesterday.
a horse kicked me to the ground. Bryn helped me up.
that part of the therapy, getting knocked to the ground?
Bryn used horses to help us learn how to control our emotions, how to be more sensitive.
and what emotions do you think made that horse want to kick you in the head?
uh, pain. I was bandaging the horse's leg.
uh, Bryn was teaching me to be a veterinary assistant.
Wow. That's a long road.
I'm out in three months. I've got a little girl, and I want to be able to take care of her.
what's your little girl's name?
none of your business.
Wow. That horse therapy's really working for you, Zoe.
we'll be in touch.
let's go.
Zoe tried to escape, Bryn got in the way.
why would she escape? She's out in three months.
cause she's a felon and a user.
you saw those track marks.
Yeah, I saw them. They were old.
it may be hard for you to comprehend, detective, but users do get clean.
people can change. Bryn Walker believed that.
maybe, but she wouldn't be the first person who got killed by giving a felon a second chance.
anything on those X-rays to give us cause of death?
not found yet.
these injuries are all remote. Maybe a couple of years old.
shattered her right ankle, broken clavicle, broke her arm a couple of times.
those are riding injuries she must have competed.
that would be an understatement.
Bryn was a champion equestrian.
she won a competition just a few days ago.
and I think I've solved the mystery about her tattoo.
the only family she has was her brother, Andrew.
he died in prison.
PA-1302 was his prison I. D. number.
if you can't save the ones you love, save everyone else. - What about the four horses?
of the apocalypse, right? - What is it with you guys?
it's the four horsemen of the apocalypse, not the horses.
I also got the blood test back.
uh, Bryn wasn't a recent user, and she didn't O. D.
and we still don't have an I. D.
of that white powder from her nails.
there is no way this woman met up with a meth head to get high.
is there anything besides the blood to implicate Zoe?
not unless she picked Bryn up by the foot and swung her around.
Tib-fib spiral fractures.
usually you see this around machinery accidents, like if a limb gets stuck in something and twisted.
there was no machinery around the crime scene.
you know what?
spiral fractures, contusions on one side...
I think that Bryn got her foot caught in her stirrup.
she was dragged by a horse.
a riding accident?
no, I find that hard to believe.
and why is that, Mr. Brooks?
ms. Walker was a pro.
did she often ride without a helmet?
Nope, but I only manage this place.
but I can tell you, she only rode one horse, and there he is, no worse for wear.
first class champion.
Shh. Ooh, it's okay. It's all right.
well, I don't see any saddle marks or sweat stains.
this horse hasn't been ridden in a while.
you know horses?
I used to ride. My daughter has the bug now.
Really? 'Cause I... I buy and sell on the side if you're ever in the market.
Bryn had a tattoo with four horses.
sure she doesn't ride any other horse?
not that I know of.
well, thank you very much for your time, Mr. Brooks.
no problem.
you know, if you're ever in the market.
did you see the way this horse flinched when he touched him?
so?
so Zoe's right.
horses are very sensitive to people.
one false move...
so we're still looking for the horse Bryn fell off of.
I'll make some calls, see if anybody in Philly has a missing horse in their backyard.
hello.
lace, hi. It's me.
what are you doing later?
the lower half of both Bryn's lungs collapsed.
Megan hasn't sectioned them yet?
she set aside the lungs for Ethan.
well, Ethan's not here, and Megan's still at the stable, so I'll do it.
well, we still don't have C. O.D.
hand me the scissors.
Thanks.
what?
first you're consulting, and now you're dissecting?
Mnh-mnh. You're never this helpful.
Todd and I are taking Lacey to Boston for the weekend.
well, being helpful isn't gon' help.
Thanks.
wait. What is that?
what is that?
looks like some kind of undigested food.
how'd that get in her lungs?
why are we doing this?
Megan thinks that Bryn falling off a horse had something to do with her death.
it would help to find some evidence that she was actually riding one.
this is definitely not in my job description.
you and me both。
I got hoofprints here.
Oh. I've got crap.
well, keep looking.
no, seriously. I've got crap.
okay.
is that...
Yep. Manure.
horse was definitely here.
we're done.
you know, horses give me the creeps.
it all goes back to my childhood, when I was younger, and my... my gramps wouldn't let us watch cartoons.
we would have to watch reruns of "Mister Ed," you know, with his lips and his teeth moving.
it was like a nightmare.
Hey, Ethan. - Huh?
I think we found our horse.
Wow. This riding vest inflates when you fall.
look, it's got a drawstring. You attach it to the saddle, and then when you fall off the horse...
I thought we were shopping for my trip.
why would we need to shop for your trip?
what kind of trip is this? - A lame one.
you don't want to go?
Emily's birthday is on Saturday, and she's having a huge party.
but instead, I get to be the third wheel with dad and Kate.
does your father know about this?
he doesn't care.
maybe you could talk to him?
maybe you could wear this vest?
mom, I know what I'm doing on a horse.
Lacey, a woman fell off her horse yesterday and died.
she was a very good rider, but her foot still got caught in the stirrup.
you're getting this vest. - I don't see how her foot could've gotten caught in her stirrup...
...because most riders I know...
use saddles with safety stirrups.
see, when you fall, the sidebar detaches, and your foot comes out.
Hey, Ethan and I found this horse out by the crime scene.
Bryn's name is on the saddle.
Where's Ethan? - Uh, therapy.
what is going on, Dr. Hunt?
detective Morris, this is my daughter, Lacey.
what the hell? Is this "bring your daughter to work day"?
watch your language. She's only 12.
I'm almost 12 1/2.
Mr. Brooks, it appears that Bryn rode more than one horse.
uh, it must be one of the misfits she used with her prisoners.
Lacey, you're up.
it's okay. - It's okay.
these kind of saddles are made with safety stirrups.
see, if you fall, and your foot gets caught, you don't get dragged 'cause it releases...
...but this one is broken.
see, it's supposed to release like this.
uh, maybe it got stuck in the accident.
Oh, right. Horse did it all by himself.
this isn't broken.
these scratches look like tool marks.
someone's tampered with this stirrup.
Bryn's saddle was sabotaged.
this is, uh, Bryn's storage shed.
well, open it.
excuse me. Will, what are you doing?
this is police business, sir.
this is private property.
you don't go in there without Bryn's permission.
Bryn's dead.
what?
he's Bryn's boyfriend.
keep him busy for a while.
I want to see what's in that shed.
sure.
Mr. Savage...
I'm very sorry that you had to find out this way.
how long were you and Bryn together?
about a year.
we, uh, met at a competition.
just moved in together.
why didn't you call the police when Bryn didn't come home?
she was here at the stable.
overnight?
Yeah. There's a couch in the office.
sometimes she would stay there if she had to work late.
the prisoner program required a ton of paperwork.
did Bryn ever mention having a fight with one of the other prisoners?
no, why?
it seems somebody sabotaged her saddle.
anyone else at the stable have a problem with Bryn?
Yeah. It's that creep who works here.
Yeah. He made some passes at her.
he... he wouldn't let her alone.
Where's my mom? - Crap.
don't sneak up on people with guns, kid.
didn't your mom tell you to wait in the car?
didn't she tell you to watch your language?
all right. Go do what she said.
you do what she said. - You do what she said.
you do what she said.
you have no idea what that stuff is, do you?
I'll figure it out.
it's a hoof pick.
cleans their feet.
Wow. Look at these ribbons.
do you know what it takes to be this kind of a champion rider?
a horse, for starters?
it's all about discipline and awareness, of yourself and your horse.
it's a lot about communication...
when to take control and when to ease up on the reins.
Oh, listen to you. A mini-Megan.
you don't like my mom much, do you?
Oh, I like her fine.
she's like liver. Six days a week is a little much.
I wouldn't know.
these look all right to you?
Yeah.
your mom's looking for you back at the car.
Hey. You find anything out from our friend?
well, it seems that Will Brooks may have wanted a little bit more than just the keys to Bryn's shed, if you know what I mean.
I don't get it.
uh... ask your mom.
Yeah. - I don't mean sex.
I mean, how does an expert rider fall off her horse?
I understand you have Bryn's file.
Yeah. I... I might have a lead on her C. O.D.
I found a piece of broccoli in her right lung that was macerated with stomach juices.
you did? - Yes, I know. Sorry.
it's your body, but you were at the stable, - and Ethan was not here. - Why are you taking Lacey to Boston?
I am not taking her anywhere. Todd is.
with you.
Megan, I'm not trying to replace you.
could I have the file, please?
so I just won't go, then. - Yes, you will.
Megan... - Her heart is normal.
blood work, too.
so how did the contents of her stomach end up in her lungs?
a blow to the abdomen? Maybe the fall off the horse?
Yes, but what made her fall off the horse...
and cause food to get in her lungs and both lower lobes to collapse?
it has to be a drug.
but you said yourself, her blood work was normal.
tox screens don't catch everything.
if there is...
an injection site, it would have to be in the abraded area.
otherwise, we would've found it earlier.
maybe someplace where she didn't feel it.
the soft tissue. Her hip.
there is a bump here.
there has to be an entry point.
you took Lacey to a crime scene?
I think he's here to see me.
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm... just... just give me one minute.
Yeah. I'll take the sample to the lab.
okay, I'll...
Lacey calls me talking about... about sabotaged saddles and... and dead horse riders.
where is she, by the way?
in my office doing homework.
any killers in there?
at least I'm not taking her away for the weekend with my new girlfriend.
why are you doing that?
she has heart set on going to that party.
Yeah, that party is being chaperoned by Emily's brother, by the way. He's 17.
which I would've known if I had any say in my daughter's life.
you gave that up five years ago.
I didn't give up being her mother.
why don't you just let her stay with me this weekend?
no. No way. I'm taking her home, Megs.
uh, results on the powder under Bryn's fingernails...
traces of oat bran and sugar and phenylbutazone, also known as...
bute. It's a... a horse pain reliever.
it's...
it, um...
it sounds like she put it in some kind of mash to feed the horse.
uh, that's not all.
you know, uh, that jumping competition she won a few days ago?
a horse was disqualified for having too much bute in its system.
whose horse?
the boyfriend... James Savage.
you think that she buted his horse to get him disqualified?
well, maybe Bryn's not as squarely clean as we thought.
you and Bryn were rivals.
see, I didn't know that, uh, horseback riding was the only olympic competition where men and women competed equally.
and she has been kicking your ass.
you've come in second ten times in the last two years to her...
the Privy Invitational, Grosspoint Grand, East Coast Summit.
she drugs your horse. You get disqualified.
she ends up dead.
I didn't kill Bryn. That is absurd.
detective, do you know why you're only allowed to give a small amount of bute for a competition?
no, doctor. Why?
because if it needs bute, that means it's injured.
and making a horse compete like that would be inhumane.
Mr. Savage, we both know Bryn was not the kind of person to bute a horse before a competition.
bute is administered orally.
if it gets on your hands, it can cause skin irritation.
you buted your own horse, didn't you?
the only thing I ever put on my horse during competition was coat shine.
I make it myself, and it's legal.
let's see. Show me your hands.
Why? - I'm gonna test you for bute.
don't you need a warrant? - Sure.
and when we get one, we'll have one for your trailer and your car, your horse, your computer.
anything on there you don't want us to find?
okay. I buted my own horse.
we're all looking for an edge.
but I didn't kill Bryn.
what I don't get it if Pagliacci here buted his own horse, then why is it on Bryn's hand?
did you find any in the shed?
no. Then again, why don't you ask your daughter?
she's like you. She's a know-it-all, too.
she should've stayed in the car.
I think she just misses you.
Why?
what?
did she say something?
look, I... I don't know kids. I just...
she seems like she wants to spend more time with you.
I told her she was nuts.
what is it?
preliminary lab report.
Bryn was injected with succinylcholine bromide.
a little slower please.
it's a paralytic that vets use to put horses down.
Ah. Now we're back to Zoe.
she was training to be a veterinary's assistant.
to provide for her daughter.
I'll send some guys out to the stables and see if there's a veterinary kit with some missing, uh...
succinylcholine bromide.
why would she kill Bryn? She was trying to help Zoe.
Why? Look at your own evidence.
the drug, the blood on Bryn's shirt, access to the saddle...
all roads lead to Zoe.
you're the one who's always talking about the body as proof.
what is it telling you?
asphyxiation by succinylcholine.
that's what killed Bryn.
there's a vial missing, and your fingerprints are all over that box.
outgoing phone records from the stable office.
somebody was calling your family.
Bryn caught you using the phone, didn't she?
threatened to take away your privileges, - bounce you out of the program... - That's not what happened.
a guard saw you arguing with Bryn outside the office an hour before she was killed.
we were arguing because I wanted her to stop calling my mother.
Bryn was making those calls? - Yeah.
she was trying to convince my mom to let my kid see me.
why would that make you angry?
my mom gave up on me a long time ago.
I appreciate what Bryn was trying to do, but you can't convince someone you've changed if they don't want to believe it.
why are your fingerprints on the box?
Bryn asked me to put that box back in the cabinet.
she'd just stopped someone from trying to put a horse down.
who? - I don't know.
some guy who doesn't like horses.
she, uh, she wouldn't say anymore.
Uh-huh. And this, uh, this horse, what did it look like?
I don't know. It was a white one.
it, uh, it was new to the stable, had an injured front leg.
you're sure the horse was white?
Yeah.
excuse me, detective.
uh, I'm Zoe Brant's mother.
you wanted to speak to me.
Oh, yes. Thanks for coming in.
uh... who is this?
this is Zoe's daughter, Laila.
Hi. - Hi.
that's pretty.
no, sweetie. Um, Laila, come... come by grandma.
thank you.
um... Mrs. Brant, have you ever talked to a woman named Bryn Walker?
what were you eating?
man, this is weird.
it looks like the horse digested some kind of metallic substance.
what is that smell?
well, I just spent an hour with the white horse trying to figure out why someone would want to kill him.
and, uh, I'm now keen-deep in horse poop.
maybe it's the horse poop.
did you find anything apart from metal in his...
Yeah, he was sick with colic.
and I found bute in his whiskers mixed in with oat bran...
oat bran and sugar.
Yes.
so Bryn was taking care of a sick horse.
but that doesn't explain why she was riding a horse she didn't own.
those are the horse's veterinary files.
I found a brand on the horse and then tracked down the owner.
any connection to Bryn? - Mm-hmm. Will Brooks.
the guy bought the horse from him, and then returned it because it didn't perform well.
this horse was supposed to compete?
you were a little, um, hard on Megan yesterday, don't you think?
Yeah. Sorry to get you involved in all that.
you kinda crossed that line when you invited Lacey to spend the weekend with us.
see, you didn't know the old Megan, okay?
she wasn't always this attentive.
so she's changed. - Yeah.
maybe she deserves a break.
whose side are you on?
ours. Listen...
we are great together.
true.
but this isn't about us.
I think maybe you invited Lacey for the weekend because... you're afraid of letting go.
no, no. Uh, you don't understand.
my parents were divorced.
I know what it's like to be stuck in the middle.
sorry.
just make sure this is about Lacey and not... about your own stuff.
okay? I gotta go. Thanks.
Yeah.
Bryn told Zoe that she stopped somebody from putting down a horse.
so maybe that led to putting down Bryn?
we figure out what's wrong with that horse, maybe we can isolate Bryn's killer.
well, I mean, I'm no veterinarian, but just looking at these X-rays, I can tell you, he's got arthritis, hyperostosis, deterioration of the skeleton.
I mean, this is an old horse.
will Brooks sold it as a show horse.
I mean, why would he think it could compete?
check out the teeth.
it looks like somebody filed them down and filled them with something.
so that's why the horse flinched.
will must have had silver nitrate on his hands.
come again?
it's called bishoping.
it's this horrible process where they use silver nitrate to alter the shape of the teeth to make the horse look younger.
and then sell it at a higher price.
so maybe Bryn discovered that Brooks was bishoping horses.
and then he killed Bryn to shut her up.
what are you searching through my stuff for?
I thought a prisoner killed Bryn.
Yeah, well, she wasn't bishoping horses, was she? Keep an eye on him.
horses freak me out, but I feel for them, knowing guys like that exist.
Hey, I got something.
huh?
succinylcholine, empty.
well, Wilbur, we just need to find the syringe.
you feel better now you got that out?
Oh, yeah.
much better.
Bryn was planning on going to the authorities.
that's why you sabotaged her saddle and shot her full of that drug.
I didn't kill Bryn, okay? We had a deal.
what deal?
she caught me. Okay.
I promised to stop bishoping horses if she kept quiet, and in return, I would give all the old horses to her therapy program.
you would just give her all the horses?
that, or I could sell 'em for dog food.
Wow. You really are a poster child for animal rights. - I kept my end.
I stayed out all night helping her with the damn horse.
helping her how? - It had colic, so you have to keep it moving.
you have to keep walking it.
and the last time I saw this, it was in Bryn's hand.
come on. I swear to you.
somebody set me up.
I'll hold him on animal cruelty, but for the murder, I need confirmation on the drug.
we'll get it to the lab right now.
any chance that Zoe set Will up?
I don't think so. I talked to Zoe's mother.
it was Bryn calling her from the stable office, not Zoe.
Why?
well, Bryn wanted Zoe to see her daughter so they could connect before she got out.
and the mother was against that?
you can't convince somebody you've changed if they don't want to believe you.
Zoe said that. - And her mother didn't buy it.
she's on the fence.
what do you think, detective?
4 horses... 8. 9 million results"?
my God.
Oh. Who are you here to see?
uh, you.
can you hang on?
this will just take a second, all right?
what?
I thought about it, and... I think Lacey should stay with you this weekend.
okay. Great.
because I've been doing some thinking, too, and I want to be more involved in her life.
from now on, I want her every other weekend.
I extend an olive branch, you want the whole tree.
I think Lacey would want me to... - Megan.
no, Megan, Megan...
hold that thought. - Yeah, sure. I'll do that.
hello.
Yeah, I'll tell him.
Oh, no, no. Do not look at me like that.
same old Megan. - No, I'm not.
what I am done is trying to prove myself to you.
and that was Lacey. You're late to pick her up.
what? I can't...
I gotta go. I... I will talk to you later.
I gotta... wow.
Todd was just here.
he had to leave to pick up Lacey, otherwise I'm sure he would've come by to say hello.
it's fine, Megan.
he doesn't have to see me every time he comes to see you.
that's very adult of you.
well, I don't imagine I'm gonna lose him to you, am I?
no, he's all yours.
I don't know if I'd go that far.
well, at least for the weekend.
Lacey's staying with me.
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.
listen, I know Todd.
I know, this kind of decision, he didn't get there without someone kicking him in the...
so...
you're actually here to thank me?
what I'm trying to say is...
that you're sorry...?
there may have been times when I took my anger at Todd out on you, and...
I'm really bad at this.
Oh, for God sake. Just say it.
okay. I'm sorry and thank you.
now see? Was it that hard?
Yes, Curtis.
we've got a problem.
I checked the amount of succinylcholine left in the syringe Ethan found.
is this right?
she didn't get enough to kill her.
there was enough succinylcholine in Bryn's system to paralyze her, but not enough to kill her.
she was still alive lying in that ravine?
that's cold.
so what stopped her breathing?
I assumed the manure at the crime scene came from the white horse, so I ran his D. N.A. against it to double-check.
it wasn't a match.
Ethan, we're trying to solve a murder.
go take your 4-H project somewhere else.
don't you get it?
the manure wasn't from the horse that Bryn was riding, Sherlock.
so someone else rode a different horse out to the crime scene.
Yes, and he ate something shiny.
glitter.
somehow he ingested it.
why would a horse eat glitter?
he wouldn't.
we found glitter on Bryn at autopsy.
traces of it on her lips.
so she ate it, too?
no, she didn't eat anything.
she inhaled it.
the glitter was on the killer's hands that's what made her stop breathing.
he suffocated her.
why would a horseback rider have glitter on his hands?
to win.
hey there.
Hi.
could you get off the horse, please, Mr. Savage?
off the horse, please.
Hi.
you give your horse every advantage, don't you?
numb its pain with drugs, coat shine on his nose to make it all shiny.
we found it in Bryn's eyes and nose.
your own special brand, remember?
you forgot it was on your glove when you suffocated her.
that's crazy. Why would I do that?
jealousy.
I saw the phone records from the stable office the night before Bryn died.
you called there repeatedly. You thought she was with Will.
you were right.
making all those times that she beat you in competition feel that much worse.
some men just can't handle that.
but her betrayal gave you the perfect way to get rid of her... pin it on Will.
you sabotaged her saddle, sent her off on her afternoon ride paralyzed with succinylcholine, and then let her horse do the rest.
you put the evidence in Will's shed,
will takes the fall, and then you start winning blue ribbons instead of red.
what happened, James... the horse reared, you didn't get the needle in far enough?
you screwed up. That's why you went out there.
you knew there was a chance she would survive.
you had to go out there to finish her off yourself.
her punishment for being better than you will ever be.
better?
so... she cheats on me with some trailer-park loser, and you think that she's better than me?
Oh, well, you showed her, didn't you?
the thing is, James, she didn't cheat on you.
Yeah, she was with Will, saving a horse's life.
you're under arrest for the murder of Bryn Walker.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be provided for you.
do you understand these rights?
some former prisoners took up a collection.
they're planning a memorial for Bryn.
so she does have a family after all.
any word from Todd?
Yeah.
he's agreed to let me have Lacey every other weekend.
we're telling her tonight.
be careful what you wish for, huh?
I, um, found the four horses, by the way.
it's a discourse by the Buddha.
the Buddha?
the excellent horse moves before the whip touches its back.
the good horse runs at the lightest touch.
the poor horse doesn't move until he feels pain.
and then there's the very bad horse.
he doesn't move until the whip penetrates his marrow.
my car accident...
was my whip.
it broke me.
and it...
brought me back to Lacey.
what if I screw up again?
you won't.
you won't.
we caught Bryn Walker's killer.
and her program's gonna continue, so you'll have a job when you get out.
I appreciate that.
there's one other thing.
Oh, my God.
Hi, baby.
mommy.
you're so beautiful.
so, uh, your mother and I were talking, and... and we were wondering...
if you wanted to stay with her more often.
but it... it's no pressure. If... if... if...
Yeah. - If you don't want to, that's okay, too.
Yeah.
no, no, I... I would like to.
okay.
okay, good. We'll come up with some kind of schedule.
all right? Something you can count on.
maybe every other weekend to start, okay?
does that mean I can stay with mom this weekend?
Yeah, it... sure.
and can I go to the party?
how about...
you and I go see a movie together?
it's a pretty good compromise.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll... I'll check online.
I'll see what the showtimes are.
nice save.
I'm learning.
the clicking of those heels could only mean one thing.
no place like home? That's where he'd rather be.
your M. I. already identified him as Freddie Delgado.
one hole in the windshield, one hole in his head.
he's got tats. Gangbanger. He's a 26er.
I don't think it was a gang hit, though.
they're usually much more out in the open, kind of a show of force.
what in the hell is this?
there's more where that came from.
C. S.U.'s got trajectory. The shooter was standing here.
clean shot. Boom.
and look here. Sunflower seeds.
shooter was probably chewing them while waiting for Delgado to show.
the killer was lying in wait. This is premeditated.
Hello, mother.
well, I have some news and I wanted to tell you in person.
what's that? I'm selling the house.
I didn't even know it was on the market.
it wasn't. A realtor came by with a cash offer from an interested buyer, and it was a very generous one. You've had that house for 40 years.
you get one offer, and you're just gonna...
what, take a chance to finally move on with my life?
okay. I just... I just... I don't know how I feel about this.
well, you never really come by.
so if you expect me to live out my days in a time capsule just because it holds ancient memories, you're mistaken.
could you just take some time to think about it? I did, and it's done.
escrow's gonna close very soon, so if you have anything at the house, you should probably come by and get it out as soon as possible.
I'll leave you to your work.
move. Please.
what's wrong with you? Nothing.
that's a whole lot of something.
if you must know, my mother is selling the house.
what house?
Oh, "the house" house.
Oh, yeah. I remember that place. Well, some of it...
the shower, kitchen counter, mudroom.
I'm gonna do my best to un-remember that.
okay.
we have some bruising, minor lacerations...
all in the process of healing.
he might have been in a fight 24 to 48 hours ago.
so I've got some info on our friend Freddie here.
he was a recent jailbird.
he shot and killed a 6-year-old girl during a robbery.
he was released just last week.
that's the same girl whose photos we found in Freddie's car.
why was he released early?
well, a mistrial was called because the prosecution improperly admitted evidence.
Oh. That's a major miss. So the murderer got to walk.
not for long.
after the ruling, the girl's father jumped over the partition, tried to attack Freddie.
said he was gonna kill him. Well, maybe he made good on his threat.
Yes, that's my daughter. That's Emily.
we're very sorry for your loss, Mr. Winters. Where did you get this?
we found multiple copies inside Freddie Delgado's car.
he was shot and killed this morning. Oh, what a shame.
you know, it's, um...
it's no secret you tried to attack him in court, Mr. Winters.
no surprise you'd be angry with him.
you have any idea why he'd have these photos? Yeah, I had been following him, leaving copies where I knew he'd find them so he wouldn't forget my baby girl or what he did.
you didn't happen to follow him to a parking garage this morning, did you?
decide to take a little revenge?
look, the day Freddie Delgado shot my daughter...
he actually took two lives.
parents aren't supposed to outlive their children.
I was supposed to watch Emily grow up.
so besides taking Emily...
he actually took my future.
and was I angry with him?
Yeah. Beyond reason.
and did I wish him dead?
but did I take revenge?
no.
not today.
I'll be right back. Here he is.
what's going on?- He's walking? - Not enough to hold him.
Oh, hey. D. N.A. evidence came back on the sunflower seeds...
no match to him or anybody in the system. Plus, his alibi checked out.
excuse me, Mr. Winters. - Yes.
I understand you were brought in for questioning on the Freddie Delgado murder.
Yes. Mr. Delgado shot and killed your daughter, yet he walked free and clear, only to be shot dead himself just this morning.
care to give us your thoughts on the matter?
my daughter was taken by a monster who showed no repentance for what he did.
and today he got what he deserved.
and I didn't kill him, but I wish I had. I should've stood up for my daughter.
Mr. Winters, are you saying you advocate vigilante justice?
call it whatever you want, but people have to pay for their actions one way or another.
an eye for an eye.
you know, and sure, people say that getting payback doesn't make you feel any better, but I'll tell you one thing... they're lying.
it does. Do you have any idea who might have done this?
that was Paul Winters speaking out on the Freddie Delgado murder.
so much for the grieving father, huh? He just laid down a call to arms.
eat up. It's gonna be a long day.
call me when you're done.
whereas I express nothing but my deepest condolences for the loss that Mr. Winters has suffered,
I cannot, however, echo his sentiments.
over here. - Ow! Ow!
vigilante justice will not be tolerated in any form.
call it whatever you want, but people have to pay for their actions one way or another.
so I was just at the lab. - An eye for an eye...
what's all this about? Why is it so busy? You have Paul Winters to thank for this.
his eye-for-an-eye speech went viral.
Wow. So people are just getting back against anyone who's wronged them?
a lot of wounded people out there just looking for a reason to go off.
26 calls so far. Thankfully, no homicides yet. Maybe I should rough up my landlord.
he's been pretty damn slow to fix my toilet.
Hey, anything on Delgado's shooter? Uh, no.
the projectile Megan recovered from his head was too damaged to run through I. B.I. S.
you know, I'm gonna double-check Paul's alibi. Run through his financials.
if he's not the killer, I don't know, maybe he hired someone to do it for him?
sounds good. I'm gonna go see the victim's widow.
this guy was no saint. Maybe something from his past came back to haunt him.
we gotta nip this in the bud, quick.
Mrs. Delgado? Yeah.
I'm Detective Sullivan from Philadelphia P. D. This is Dr. Hunt from the Medical Examiner's Office.
could we talk to you for a minute?
what's it like to be married to a child killer? Hey.
Mrs. Delgado, we're very sorry about your husband.
we're trying to determine who shot him, but we couldn't help but notice his gang tattoos.
that's old ink. He gave all that up when Horacio was born.
freddie wanted a better life for him.
but ain't nobody hiring a high school dropout with a record.
but babies still need formula, right? Is that why he robbed that supermarket?
look, he didn't mean for nobody to get hurt, okay?
and if that one bullet hadn't gotten away from him...
it tore Freddie up inside.
not enough for him to plead guilty.
Where'd this come from?
that girl's dad came by day before yesterday, shoved it under the door.
freddie caught him. He tried to apologize, but that guy went crazy.
I mean, like totally out of his mind. Freddie...
he just stood there. I mean, he didn't even fight back. Like, how could he?
Hi, papa. Hi. Come on, baby.
now he's gone, and we're alone, and the world just keeps turning.
we're gonna find out who did this. Yeah. Whatever.
paul didn't say anything about going to the victim's house. Yeah, or attacking him again.
I checked out Mr. Eye For An Eye's alibi. Any holes?
no, the opposite actually.
I got time-stamped security footage of him at a food court at Westbrook Mall.
he was there at the time of the shooting. So Paul couldn't have done it.
could he have hired somebody? Not unless hit men do pro bono work.
after Paul's daughter was killed, he got a divorce, he lost his job.
you know, he doesn't have two dimes to rub together. We're at a dead end.
so we let it be. Karma killed him.
you know what? Honestly, I'm not gonna lose any sleep over it.
what's going on with you? You don't like the victim so you stop doing your job?
Hi. - Hi, grandma.
come on in.
Hi, sweetheart. Hi, Megan.
Yeah. - I'm excited for you.
yeah? - I was thinking maybe you could move downtown and be closer to us.
Oh, I would love that. I would love it. Mm.
you're such a doll.
well, Megan, I'll be selling most of the furniture and the decor, so feel free to take anything of sentimental value.
sentimental value? Imagine that.
I used to come up here when I was your age to get lost.
here it is.
was this yours?
Oh, look.
quarter.
I put the stitches in that tiger.
always a doctor.
is that grandpa?
what was he like?
he was funny.
liked to dance.
he was a little sad.
mom, what is it?
please put that down.
mom.
this is daddy's stuff. You told me you got rid of everything.
it doesn't belong to you. Just... just put it down.
or what, I might actually feel something?
when addy died, it's like... it's like you erased him.
I guess... If he never existed, then he never shot himself in the head, right?
Megan, this isn't the time. It's never the time.
for 35 years, it has not been the time.
now you're selling the house, and all that's left of him is in this little box.
you want me to get rid of this, too? I don't want to talk about this.
I do! Close that box.
no. Megan.
for God sake.
what?
I'll be there.
come on.
fancy meeting you here. What do you got?
okay. Victim is Lori Keyser, 34 years old.
she's a local. This is a halfway house.
she's been here for three weeks since she got out of prison. For doing what?
she did 5 years of a 30-year term for killing her ex-boyfriend threw acid in his face.
and now she's had acid thrown in her face.
an eye for an eye.
looks like we got another vigilante murder on our hands.
...we're in uncertain times.
and in times like this, we want to know that someone is looking out for our interests.
not the interests of lobbyists pocketing...
damn it.
damn it. Lining the pockets...
do you have to do that? - I'm sorry.
I thought you were already giving a statement on the new vigilante murder, but that sounded more like a speech. Not like a very good one.
are you announcing your candidacy? Tomorrow.
that's big. Why didn't you tell me?
well, because for one thing, you've accused me of having divided focus, and I don't want that again.
so you've been burning the candle at both ends, and it's weighing on you.
no, I'm fine. If that were so, you wouldn't be wearing your B.D.B.
my what? Bottom-drawer blouse.
the one you've got on is much too last season for you.
that you slept on the couch last night, pulled out your B. D.B. Freshened up, thought nobody would be the wiser.
do you have an off switch? No.
I really do hate you sometimes.
okay, yes, it... it's weighing on me.
did you need something? Yeah, uh, Tommy and Adam are here.
I thought you might want to be apprised of the latest vigilante murder, but never mind.
no, I do. I do. No, no.
you work on your speech. I got this covered.
okay.
let's all get on the same page here.
Lori Keyser's cause of death was acute respiratory failure due to inhalation of acid vapor.
delicate way to put it. That was nasty.
Curtis is rushing her tissue to the lab to see if we can type the acid.
and it was an obvious case of revenge. Seven years ago,
Lori threw acid in her ex-boyfriend's face after he got married to another woman.
she was convicted of first-degree murder. How'd she get out after five years?
well... commuted sentence. Prison overcrowding. Sign of the times.
are you gonna try to solve this one, Tommy, or is Lori too unlikable for you?
I've dated worse, as you know.
so... the next question obviously is, who would want to get back at Lori?
how about the wife of the man that she killed? Already looked it up. Since remarried.
her name is Susan Hart. All right.
Oh, do you want to drive or... Thank you. Thank you very much.
why don't you give me a call next week, and, um, we can see... - - How you doin'?
detective Sullivan, Philadelphia P. D. Mrs. Hart, your husband said you would be here.
could we talk to you for a moment? Sorry about the intrusion. Uh...
o... okay. Wh... what's this about? Oh, Lori Keyser.
she was murdered last night. I'm sorry. Murdered?
uh, Susan, would you, um, would you... would you like to use my office?
Yeah, thanks. Um, please.
thank you. Thank you.
and you are? Megan Hunt, medical examiner.
Trent marsh. That's a...
that's a very effective book.
silent ANGUISH
did you lose someone to suicide?
I was wondering whether Susan's mood was any different today.
you know I can't answer any questions about a patient.
but a valiant attempt to change the subject away from yourself.
I thought that was supposed to be my job. And are you good at it, your job?
I'd like to think so.
I'm sorry. I just... I'm... I'm having a hard time processing what you're telling me.
Lori Keyser was... killed and...
with acid?
the killing could be seen as poetic justice.
and of course, you suspect me.
Oh, my God. I...
Lori was a disturbed woman. I... I could never do anything like that.
your new husband doesn't seem to think you've gotten over your loss.
bill doesn't understand me.
not at all.
as if I could just forget and... move on.
Jeffrey's murder split my life in two parts, into a before and after.
and all the things I've done since that day to pass the time...
my... job, my hobbies, my...
current marriage...
just distractions to...
but necessary ones, because without them, I honestly,
I don't know what I'd do. What happened to your hand, Mrs. Hart?
I burned myself this morning while I was cooking breakfast.
I specialize in... grief counseling.
and though the loss of a loved one is extremely difficult in any case, survivors of suicide tend to have the most difficult grief journey.
those who lose someone to homicide have a target for their anger...
the person who took their loved one out of the world.
but with suicide, the target of your anger is the same person you're also mourning.
if you don't mind me asking... Who did you lose?
I really should get back to my colleagues.
Megan, you don't need to run away from this... It's Dr. Hunt.
let's go. She's coming with us. Nice office. Thanks.
Absolutely. Um, please.
please take it.
and if you ever need to talk, here's my card.
I'm sorry about before.
you made me realize, it's time.
you should have this.
you know, I never told you before, but when people used to ask me about your father,
I told them he had a heart attack.
I was so afraid of what they would think.
I blamed myself...
for not seeing the signs, for not realizing that he was in pain, and for not being a good enough wife to make him want to stay alive.
I would've been there for you... If you'd let me.
you were 12, Megan.
it's a mother's job to shield her children from pain, not dwell on it.
that's why I took everything out of the house.
you know, I just thought that...
I only wanted to protect you.
what I... what is this, a suicide note?
how is that... the... the police never found one.
that's because I found it first.
and what, you just... you kept this?
you hid this all these years? The deed was done.
I was ashamed, all right?
why do you keep questioning me about something that happened a lifetime ago?
the coward killed himself, Megan.
what if he didn't? Oh, please. Not that conversation again.
I know that your precious father can do no wrong in your eyes.
how could he?
he hasn't had 35 years to become the disappointment to you that I obviously have.
why now? Why are you showing this to me now?
because I think you should stop living under the assumption that there's an answer to every question.
why did he do it? I don't know.
but give it up, Megan. I did.
no. Never.
it's almost lunch time. Where the hell you been?
everybody and they mama calling my line. Oh, I knew I should've taken a personal day.
you don't take personal days, remember? I got an update on your murder victim Lori keyser.
she was doused with hydrofluoric acid. Our suspect Susan Hart had a burn on her arm.
same acid? No, ma'am. Susan was burned with cooking oil.
she was telling the truth. Her alibi checks out, too.
great. Another dead end.
well, P. D.'s widening their search grid around the crime scene, looking for any container of that acid.
Lacey. Why are you...
we were supposed to go to lunch. What, did you forget?
no. I did not.
no, ma'am. I don't...
hold on. Now where you goin'?
you just got here. Guess I'm taking that personal day after all.
well, why don't everybody just go home?
Bye, Lace.
did you make up with grandma yet?
we don't make up, honey. We endure.
I know things with you two can get... complicated.
I know you're mad at grandma because she never talks about grandpa, but you don't talk about him either.
Yes, I do.
well...
it's been a long time, and... and... and he's not around, but...
I think about him. I do.
mom, when I was kidnapped, you had me start seeing that therapist.
she's really helped me a lot. What about you?
I mean, maybe you could see someone, too, and talk about all your stuff.
"my stuff"?
maybe if you get to know yourself a little better, it would help me get to know you better, too.
what? Fine. My therapist told me to say that.
I'm shocked.
you talk to your therapist about me, your own mother?
maybe just... a little.
I have to go to the restroom. Yeah. Quick escape.
this is a safe place, Megan.
just relax.
so how does this work? What do I... am I...
whatever makes you comfortable.
not lying down. All right.
why don't we start by just...
telling me what you remember about the incident when you lost someone?
okay.
I was 12.
I was, um, walking home from school...
by myself, as usual.
it was hot that day...
unseasonably so.
and I was walking towards my house. I saw lights.
there were police cars. And, uh, I walked towards the porch.
this policeman came up to me, told me my mother wasn't home.
then he just kind of looked at me and said, "your father's dead.
and I sat on the porch for, um, 40 minutes, by myself, wondering who was going to water the plants that were right by the front door, 'cause that was my father's job.
he always took care of them, and... who's gonna water them now?
I know it sounds really stupid, but... No.
no, it's never stupid.
there's no right way to deal with loss.
and as I mentioned, suicide bereavement can be one of the toughest to deal with.
for one, survivors tend to feel a lot more guilt.
did you?
I thought that, um...
he was mad at me, that I was bad.
why else would he do it?
why else would he leave me alone?
the trouble is, most suicide victims rarely offer up...
a true motive.
did he leave a note?
I think that, um... I should go back to work.
no, Megan, we... I'm sorry.
we've only just begun, Megan.
Hey. Thought you had a personal day today.
I just saw Paul Winters. Our shooting suspect, where?
I was at the therapist's office again... the same th...
don't ask why.
and he was waiting in the office. He's a patient.
so the same therapist who's been treating Susan Hart?
that's not a coincidence. Both of our cases, they gotta be linked.
Yeah, but there's no evidence they got vengeance on their loved ones' killers.
no, but what if they killed for each other?
we've got two murders, two suspects, and both of 'em have airtight alibis.
and they're seeing the same therapist.
maybe they bonded over their grief in the waiting room.
so they do a little crisscross to get revenge, like "strangers on a train"?
kill for each other, no one suspects. It's the perfect crime.
not if we can prove conspiracy. We just link them up to each other's murders.
the lab's working on overdrive, trying to match the sunflower seeds from the shooting scene to Susan.
what about the acid crime scene?
C. S.U. found a plastic bottle about 5 blocks away from that halfway house with hydrofluoric acid inside.
so they're running the bottle for prints and D. N.A. with the hope that they can match it to Paul.
Yeah, but look at them. They look hardly capable of murder.
under the influence of grief, anything's possible.
great. Now you're saying I've...
I've killed some woman I've never even met? Well, that would be the point, wouldn't it?
you kill for Susan Hart, she kills for you.
Susan who? This is crazy. Paul, Paul...
I can't help you if you don't talk to me.
now you've been through enough, haven't you? Y... you're right. I have.
I'm not saying another word. Not till you get me my lawyer.
no. No,
I only know who Paul Winters is because I saw him on TV. I swear.
Susan, I know you don't think that anybody could possibly understand all the emotions that you're going through right now since your husband was taken away from you, but I want you to know that I do, more than you know.
and I can understand why you'd want his killer to pay for what she did.
no, please, stop talking about it. Stop. Susan, did you kill Freddie Delgado?
No!
I don't know who he is.
I don't know him.
please stop.
Susan's not talking.
Yeah, well, Paul lawyered up.
if they think we're on to them, that's their last recourse.
they can't admit to knowing each other. She's about to crack. Look at her.
I just need some more time.
Yeah, Detective Lucas.
uh, yeah. Yeah, that can't be. Can you check it out again, please?
okay. Thank you. Well, that was the lab.
everything's a bust. What's going on?
D. N.A. from both crime scenes came back. No matches to Paul or Susan.
they didn't kill each other's targets.
great. That's all we had. We're back to square one.
not quite. Uh, you won't believe why.
both D. N.A. profiles? They're identical.
wait a minute.
the same person killed both victims?
well, the only thing connecting both crimes is that therapist.
Dr. Trent Marsh.
Dr. Marsh, our shrink, has quite the background.
ten years ago, his wife was murdered in their own house.
was he a suspect?
naturally, as the husband, but he was ruled out early on 'cause homicide had one guy in mind.
Nathan Jarvis, ex-con who'd done some time for sexual assault.
was he charged? Detained. Released due to lack of evidence.
so this case was never solved?
a year later, Marsh went back to school, got his PHD in clinical psychology, opened up his own practice, specializing in bereavement counseling.
this guy has been immersed in grief for the last ten years.
I mean, it's only natural he'd go off the deep end, but why now?
maybe he wants to give Paul and Susan some kind of... closure.
Adam went to our offsite storage facility to dig up the file from the wife's murder.
D. N.A. reference samples got to include Marsh at that time.
as soon as we match his profile to our two crime scenes, we got him.
you really went to this guy for therapy?
What'd you tell him? Enough.
now we make him talk.
thanks for coming down to the station, Dr. Marsh.
I was hoping you could shed some light on a couple of open investigations I have going right now.
certainly.
two people killed by acts of vengeance...
both of them killed in the exact same way that they killed someone else.
I see. Yeah.
my prime suspects are both patients of yours...
paul Winters and Susan Hart.
that's, uh... that's troublesome.
uh... well, as you know, doctor-patient confidentiality would normally preclude me from talking about my clients, but under the circumstances...
uh, when I counsel survivors of homicide,
I do have them focus their anger towards whoever's responsible for the loss of their loved ones.
just so they can get to a place of forgiveness, in order to allow the healing to begin.
I just hope I'm not in some way...
responsible. I think you are.
not for the same reason, but Paul and Susan, they're innocent.
they haven't killed anybody.
but one person did, and the only thing those cases have in common...
is you.
so you're leaping to the conclusion that I must have done it.
have you deduced what my possible motive could be as well?
there's your history. Your wife was murdered.
the killer was never caught.
meaning what, I'm dissociating?
murdering others to feed my desire for closure that I haven't been able to attain?
I like that. Oh, now you're really thinking.
look, it's true...
my wife does remain unspoken for, like so many.
think of all the families shattered every minute because of someone else's selfish homicidal whim.
the... ripple effects of that single act, psychologically damaging possible generations to follow.
and yet so many of those killers walk free from a lack of evidence, because of red tape, technicalities.
we try. You fail.
but you sought to rectify that.
kill the killers yourself. Make sure justice was served?
see, again, you try, you fail...
wasting your time accusing me.
look, I'm happy to go through the motions if it'll justify your paycheck.
search my house, take my prints, my D. N.A...
whatever it is you do nowadays.
I am not a murderer, detective.
and even if I were, I'm sure you couldn't prove it anyway.
please tell you got something to nail this guy.
Trent's D. N.A. doesn't match the D. N.A. from our crime scenes.
you're kidding me. - What?
no, but here's the really messed up part...
when C. S.U. was typing the D. N.A. from the old case, another sample popped up.
Nathan Jarvis. That's the prime suspect in the murder of Trent's wife.
seems impossible, I know, but then it hit me, so I looked up Jarvis, and guess what.
a year ago, he went missing and was never found. It's him. I know it. He's behind it.
Trent killed Jarvis. He puts Jarvis' D. N.A. at his murder scenes.
the seeds, the acid container, all he has to do is put them in contact with Jarvis' body to get his epithelials on them.
one big screw you to Philly's finest. Yeah. Guess what. It worked.
he's getting away with murder.
and I promise that I will represent the priorities and values of this great city while cutting through the partisan paralysis that's choking Washington.
all I'm asking is that you give me that chance. I won't let you down. Thank you.
you looked pretty great up there. Oh, Dan.
auspicious start to your campaign.
presented your platform, thanked the right people, made all the right promises.
I'm surprised you weren't there to watch over your investment.
I would've been, believe me, but the day job called.
you've been apprised of the Trent Marsh case?
disturbing. Well, he just walked.
how is that possible?
there wasn't a shred of hard evidence connecting him to either murder.
we couldn't make a case against him.
look, we know he killed those people, but there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.
I really don't want to believe that. Neither do it.
but unfortunately, in my office, we don't practice justice, Kate.
we practice law.
Trent March, Ph. D Clinical Psychology - Grief Counseling
Megan. What a lovely surprise.
did you want to make another appointment?
this is yours. I don't want it.
you're rather brave, to come here all alone.
aren't I a diabolical killer? Well, you only kill people you think deserve it.
I'm very sorry... about what happened to your wife.
I deal with the bereaved in my line of work all the time.
and I never get used to it, seeing people on the worst day of their lives.
grief is messy.
it's raw.
it makes people do unimaginable things.
do you really think that by identifying with me, you'll trick me into some sort of admission?
Oh, no. You're way too smart for that. I came as a warning.
a warning?
you may think you've helped your clients by giving them some kind of closure.
what about your victims?
what about the loved ones they've left behind?
aren't they gonna want closure, seek revenge?
what if they find out what you've done?
is that some sort of threat? If you want to see it like that.
when it's my time...
it's my time.
and until then, I have a lot more patients...
that could do with my help.
not if I have anything to do with it. You're sicker than any of them.
Oh, you don't really mean that, do you?
I wish I could spend some more time with you, Megan.
I'd really love to chat about your daddy.
any chance I'll be seeing you again?
eventually...
everyone does.
don't you ever go home? Don't you?
needed a breather. Marsh got a little under my skin.
sociopaths tend to do that. Your therapist.
so you ready to tell me why you went to see him?
what's this?
a favor.
I have a heavy heart because of what I need to do.
to those who will read this, I'm truly sorry.
but this world is not for me.
it's my father's suicide note, which my mother has kept hidden for 35 years.
no wonder you've been in such a weird head space. Megan, I am so sorry.
I need you to run it through the lab...
prints, D. N.A. Handwriting analysis, the works.
you know I'm not supposed to tie up the lab with personal use, which means we can't tell a soul.
but just one question.
Why?
because I don't believe a word in that note.
my father did not kill himself.
I know it.
nice street.
I thought you hated your life in chestnut hill.
hated" is a little strong. I loathed it.
fancy cars, nice houses, citywide recognition as a top neurosurgeon...What's the to like?
the recognition was nice. I wouldn't want to relive the rest.
Oh, and yet you jumped at the chance to take this case.
I still have a few friends here.
I hope this isn't one of 'em.
you flying solo today, bud? Excuse me.
uh, sam's in d. c. Her father's sick.
Oh, i'm sorry to hear it.
that's daphne zimmer, editor of "society fair" magazine.
you know her? - My mother does.
did. - Really? How well?
well enough.
listen, if this is gonna be too difficult for you...
death is always difficult, detective.
is that daphne's?
color looks different than hers. Better bag it. - Okay.
what have we got?
the maid found the body a half-hour ago. The alarm was off, no sign of forced entry.
the gate was left open.
there was obviously a struggle.
table overturned, a sandal off her foot.
my guess is...
daphne was reading here, someone came in to rob the place, came on daphne by surprise, they fought, and our bad guy vanished into this morning's traffic.
what makes you think it was this morning?
her body's still
gone into rigor mobent the pinkie. that's all.
discoloration in the lower right quadrant. You know what that is?
bruising from the attack. - It's decay.
but the body's limp. It hasn't gone into rigor.
she's already past rigor.
the skin is macerated. She didn't die this morning. She died at least two days ago.
thanks for playing.
all right, everybody. Increase the timeline to 48 hours.
daphne zimmer-- born in rural ohio, educated at wellesley and harvard business school.
ran a fashion house in new york,
and then came here to take over "society fair" magazine 11 years ago.
she became quite a power player.
why is it whenever a man calls a woman a "power player," it sounds pejorative?
uh, your imagination.
so now you're patronizing me?
okay, i'm not playing in this minefield.
you're already in it, pal.
maceration is consistent with her position in the water, so she wasn't moved.
and she was out in the open air for at least two days near a garden.
so... When there's a garden, there's entomology, and when the's entomology, there's...
Curtis, just in time. I have a present for you.
and don't worry. He's got friends.
second-stage calliphoridae.
blowfly maggots to you.
by my estimate, she's been dead for at least two days.
how fast can you confirm that?
well, there are six stages from eggs to adult.
I'd need to grow these little guys out, then calculate backwards.
20 days, maybe 25.
how about tomorrow?
I'll do my best.
Oh, a present for ethan. This is the only, uh, trace evidence we found.
tell him i want a full analysis. - Full analysis. Got it.
come on, little guys. Let's eat.
what else does that thing tell you?
uh, daphne zimmer never married, no kids. Apparently, that magazine was her life.
guess where we're going.
you're not gonna open her up?
we have to wait for the body to dry out before we make an incision.
in the meantime, let's go find a match for that hair sample.
there she is-- daphne zimmer.
modest.
confident.
I don't see one hanging over your office.
yet.
the show must go on, apparently.
always busy between fashion week and charity ball season.
I'll take your word for it.
sorry. - It's okay.
can i help you? - We need to see who's in charge here.
I don't know if i can get her right now. She's in a meeting.
who's in a meeting? - Daphne.
are we talking about the same person? - Hang on a sec.
daphne zimmer, the head of the magazine. Her meetings are epic. She might be a while.
she might be a lot longer than you think.
I see a lot of anxious people, not a lot of grief.
well, they just found out their boss died. They're probably in shock.
either that or work has taken its toll. Look at these people.
he's got rhinophyma-- tip o'neill nose. Heavy drinker.
she bites her nails, wears acrylics to cover up the damage.
chews jewelry--keeps the nails out of the mouth.
and he has got trichotillomania.
compulsive hair puller.
and he's just fidgety.
you are looking at some serious signs of stress.
in other words, somebody wanted the boss dead, and i am looking at a room full of suspects.
excuse me. Who's daphne's assistant?
let's start with him.
Hey. Kate murphy returning your call. Sorry we keep playing phone tag.
um, i'm at the office now, but you could always call me on my cell.
I didn't hear anything. - Next time, try knocking.
right. Sorry. Knock.
I'm pulling you off the mackavoy case.
I want you to focus on daphne zimmer what do you have so far?
about... The hair?
that curtis gave me half an hour ago? - That's right.
it's human.
And?
it's human.
daphne zimmer was very well-respected in this community.
a lot of people are asking questions,
and you have the only trace evidence from the crime scene connected to the killer.
so top priority.
start with the roots of the hair, look for any d. n.a. - Okay.
let me get this straight.
you told the interns to say daphne was in a meeting?
it's the standard blowoff when we didn't know where she was.
so she was in the habit of going missing?
for days at a time.
we've all come to expect it, and it's my job to cover for her.
Yeah, you were her first assistant, her gatekeeper.
you didn't know where she went?
St. barths, the vineyard. It's a, uh, sociy magazine.
daphne went out to society.
uh, but she was paranoid about anybody knowing her schedule.
but you set her schedule, didn't you? - In the office, yeah.
daphne trusted me, and we got along great, but she didn't tell me everything.
so when was the last time you had contact with her?
five days ago.
we spoke on the phone.
and i haven't seen or heard from her since.
it appears that your hair twirler, stephen burkett, was the last person to see daphne alive.
that was five days ago, so if we're saying...
that she died two days ago, that's a lot of time that's unaccounted for, and...
Hi, mom. - Hey. Did you hear about daphne?
Yes, i did.
Oh, boy, i'm gonna miss her. We were so close.
I know. I'm very sorry.
then tell me what you know.
mom, you know i can't tell you anything.
well, at least let me see you tonight. I could do with some company.
listen, the club is having a black-tie social. Will you come?
the last time you made me go, you paraded me in front of 30 of your friends,
and all they did was ask about todd.
Megan, please.
I'm sorry, mom. I...
I have a killer to catch.
how was your mom?
she wants me to go to some god-awful club dinner.
sounds like real quality time.
no time with my mother is quality time.
what are you looking for?
you know how your skin prunes up when you take a bath?
when a waterlogged body dries out, the skin smooths, revealing marks that were somet.
like those.
nail marks.
from the struggle? - Maybe.
bruising can show up to a week later. Bring down that light, will you?
they're square.
and thicker than normal.
acrylics.
is bud still at the magazine?
daphne was a, uh... Force of nature.
just...I can't believe she's dead.
did you know her long?
11 years. I was, uh, office manager when she came on as editor.
would you say that you and she were friends? - Yeah.
would you mind explaining why your nail marks are on her body?
um, and this year, she opened it up to everybody-- the assistants, the interns and this copy editor complained.
you don't complain to daphne.
she went ballistic. I had to pull her off of him.
did it bother you, her, uh, opening it up to everyone?
high society is a cutthroat world.
I don't have what daphne has.
even she was always looking over her shoulder for someone trying to take her down.
anybody in particular?
pick a name.
but she had her own way of watching her back.
thank you very much.
would you mind sending in your copy editor next, please?
um, sure.
no blood or water in the lungs.
no physical signs of drowning.
so we think daphne died two days ago, but we have no idea what killed her?
correct.
but i did find kidney damage and 4-gland parathyroid hyperplasia.
and that's bad how?
high calcium. Symptoms include...
mood swings, anger, paranoia.
so maybe daphne couldn't help her behavior in the office.
