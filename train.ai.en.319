mr dodd's bill passed the banking committee last month without a single republican vote.
mr dodd's decision "makes it more likely that regulatory reform will be enacted," says edward yingling, chief executive of the american bankers association, because it "frees him from political dynamics that would have made it more difficult for him to compromise."

mr draghi is proving to be as adroit a diplomat and politician as he is a central banker.
mr draghi is used to being called on in a pinch.

mr fujii had earlier said that a strong yen could give japanese consumers greater buying power and help to encourage a rebalancing of the economy away from its long-standing dependence on exports for growth.

mr kondo was also forced to remove casings from the computer and blow cool air onto the machine with fans as the temperature in his home rose to 40 degrees in the hottest japanese summer since 1946.

mr krause spoke as deutsche bank earnings outstripped expectations in a strong first quarter.

mr kudrin's plea to see his deputy and let him out on bail was ignored.
mr kudrin's resignation, after mr putin's promise to make mr medvedev prime minister, also lowers the chances of the sort of authoritarian modernisation that some liberals had once hoped for.

mr kueperkoch said that he was confident of demand for a brothel in the area and planned to take a claim for compensation to the highest court.

mr madoff acted as custodian of assets that were placed with him and had no external administrator because he ran a brokerage, rather than a formal hedge fund, several investors say.
mr madoff claimed he pulled off this massive fraud alone, but this seems unlikely.

mr morsi's victory, and the strong presence of the ultra-fundamentalist salafists in the egyptian parliament, is testimony to the growing power of political islam.

mr moussa is part of the old system; but at least he is experienced and knows the arts of diplomacy and compromise.
mr moussa is wrong and his comments are irresponsible.
mr moussa's position is important for two reasons.
mr moussavi and mehdi karroubi, the reformist candidate, alleged widescale fraud and asked the guardian council, the constitutional watchdog, to hold the election again.
mr moussavi, however, laid responsibility for the violence on the government and insisted that street protests should be pursued.
mr moussavi, more-over, while he might have been more straightforward on iran's nuclear ambitions, would not have been more pliant.
mr moutran says they always provoke a comment.
mr movie star!
mr moynihan is working hard to win over fretful clients and investors.
mr moynihan promised this week that these sorts of inefficiencies would be eliminated, a strategy that would perhaps have resonated more had not his audience heard similar pledges repeatedly before.

mr mubarak must seek to draw the brothers openly into the parliamentary and perhaps even ministerial fold, and test their sincerity, at first by giving them a chance to run local councils.
mr mubarak was right in a wider sense, too.
mr mubarak's son gamal is often tipped as the old man's successor.

mr mufuruki was not expecting much to begin with.
mr mugabe also decisively lost the first round of the presidential poll, held on the same day, to mr tsvangirai.
mr mugabe and his sullen cronies, who have long assumed that the state and the ruling party are one and the same, may seek to divert the aid and dispense their patronage as before, in the hope that mr tsvangirai will soon get the blame.
mr mugabe cheerily waved his fist for the cameras alongside mr ahmadinejad, but a spokesman for morgan tsvangirai's party, which is in a unity government with mr mugabe's one, called iran's president a "warmonger, a trampler of human rights, an executioner."
mr mugabe had earlier snubbed the sadc gathering in zambia, while the opposition movement for democratic change (mdc), plausibly insisting it had won the presidential vote, called on the region's leaders to persuade mr mugabe to step down, and urged mr mbeki to abandon his "quiet diplomacy."

mr mugabe's mortality terrifies the security bosses and hardliners in his zanu-pf party.
mr mugabe's ruling zanu-pf also appears determined to reverse the majority that the opposition won in the national assembly for the first time since the country's independence in 1980.
mr mugabe, abetted by south africa's bafflingly complaisant president, thabo mbeki, will try to engineer a government of national unity, with his own people in the driving seat, while co-opting and confusing as many of mr tsvangirai's party as possible.

mr mullan, an english professor at university college london, manages to make literary criticism fun.

mr muller gave no details of how the offer had been revised but people familiar with the situation said an alternative source of finance would be needed without the eib loan.
mr muller said this growth reflected the fact that "more and more customers want a one-stop shop" instead of going to specialist retailers.
mr mulligan said that yoghurt was already an existing category in china, but that it was usually consumed as a drink.
mr mullin and mr benn, and also alan clark, the finest parliamentary diarist of the century, all fit this description.

mr mullins says the evening standard will offer screen tests to all its journalists.

mr murakami has become a global brand, but he could not be anything other than japanese.
mr murakami said that incentives to buy fuel-efficient vehicles and energy efficient electronic products have had a stronger impact on consumption than many economists had expected.

mr murakami's version is lurid and surreal, a thrilling mash-up of ancient imagery and trippy effects (detail pictured).

mr murdoch's tolerance for invasions of privacy by his reporters and the belief that he would not be subject to sanctions by governments that owed him political favours gave his editors confidence.

mr musharraf resigned as president a year ago to avoid impeachment by parliament, paving the way for fresh elections that brought president asif ali zardari to power.
mr musharraf's critics say he manipulated the stand-off with the clerics of the lal masjid to distract public attention from his domestic political difficulties and to impress on washington his own centrality in the fight against extremism in pakistan.

mr nagai is the first ceo with a strong domestic retail background to head nomura in about 15 years.

mr najib said he favoured gradual reform of the government's policy of preferential treatment of the ethnic malay majority population to help support economic restructuring.
mr najib says the etp is starting the year "with a bang by switching into overdrive," part of a wider modernisation to win the malaysian economy rich-world status by 2020.
mr najib still wants to lift malay corporate ownership to the nep target of 30%, from a claimed 19% now.
mr najib will have to win big to convince the sceptics, at the very least restoring the bn's two-thirds majority.
mr najib's new-found zest may simply reflect the rallying of support an incumbent can often expect before a malaysian election.
mr najib's supporters hope that solidly positioning their man as a progressive reformer, a sort of malaysian tony blair, will also revitalise the prime minister's flagging political fortunes.
mr nakagawa is a conservative ally of shinzo abe, the prime minister.

mr nathan is different from many people.
mr nathan's reputation as a scholar is such that one is inclined to trust him. But readers should not forget that, like kremlinology before it, the study of zhongnanhai, the compound where china's rulers live and work, is a very shadowy business.
mr natuzzi's firm has led the way in responding to the chinese challenge.
mr naumann says carmakers that previously had a limited range can now span the full spectrum, with the number of domestic models rising from 53 in 2006 to 159 last year.

mr niwa said that while mr ishihara's scheme could face legal and other obstacles, even a possible pre-purchase survey of the islands could be diplomatically incendiary.

mr nixon and mr kissinger did seize diplomatic opportunities with consummate skill.
mr niyazov has not gone quite so far; he has merely extended his current eight-year term indefinitely.
mr niyazov has renamed months of the calendar after members of his family, banned beards and gold teeth, and built a leisure centre for horses, complete with swimming pool, air-conditioning and an operating theatre.
mr niyazov uses similar tricks, though he is less practised.

but honestly, I don't think that you remember anything clearly from that night.
but honestly, I don't want it to be you.
but honestly, I don't want to hear it.
but honestly, I don't.
but honestly, I find that a little hard to believe...
but honestly, I haven't checked.
but honestly, I heard from some people who saw you
but honestly, I just need to be a little crazy.
but honestly, I love being single. I love everything about my life.

but honestly, look at me, huh?
but honestly, man, I don't think she missed you that much.
but honestly, nothing quite like this.
but honestly, she's just not us.
but honestly, since four of my last five calls to your phone went straight to voicemail
but honestly, since you've been back,
but honestly, so was I when I defended your son who was guilty of rape. I never once left your side, and...
but honestly, that is a distant second.
but honestly, that's not where the pain is coming from,
but honestly, the bullet doesn't tell me much.
but honestly, the next thing we have to do may be in the city.
but honestly, there's no comfort that
but honestly, though, brunch?
but honestly, ultimately, it's up to you.
but honestly, until now...
but honestly, we all have something, right?
but honestly, what can that guy do that I can't?
but honestly, what this part of town
but honestly, when you really get down to it, it's all about faith.
but honestly, when you really get down to it,
but honestly, who here hasn't?
but honestly, why put yourself through all that for people you just met a few years ago?

but honestly, you ought to have six weeks straight at campo
but honestly, you're just gonna get that much better as time goes on.
but honestly, you're not worth the time.
but honestly, your voice
but honestly? No, you can't.
