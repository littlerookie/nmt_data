Wally had operativesin places-- mechanics, valets, car wash attendants...
all copying people's keys and then stealing their cars from different locations.
does it say anything in there about them stealing loose change or switching the presetson radios?
cause that happens to me all the time.
okay, Gus.
go ahead and put your aluminum foil hat back on.
I'm not paranoid, Shawn. It happens.
anyway, I believe this is a department record for the fastest bust ever in a case this size.
truly your most efficient work.
Oh, stop. That's so unnecessary.
you know, I couldn't help but notice that a certain vehicle belonging to a certain head detective just happens to not be here.
belonging to a certain head detective just happens to not be here.
lassie, we had the boys from crime scene move your car up the street right before youa nd the chief arrived.
you're in the clear, tiger.
Thanks.
Although...today is a street sweeping day.
did we park on the east side or the west side of the street?
north side.
no, no, no. It wasn't the north side.
Yes, it was.
I'd know, Shawn.
I'm good with directions. You're not.
Gus, you have the bearings of a wounded bumblebee. Why would-- uh-oh.
we needto get out of here.
well, you're certainly a unique guy, Shawn.
a guy who callsthe day he gets the number.
and brings flowers.
I stole the flowers.
from table one.
they're fake, and they smell vaguely of creamy pesto, but I'm pretty sure it's the thought that counts.
and you're good enough to come and meet me here my last free night before my parents arrive.
Oh, wrapping up this casewas a lot easier than I thought.
and this is one of the biggest strawberries I've ever seen.
impressive.
I've been here all day.
so...
what do you saywe take our dessert back to my place?
I say yes.
was this too easy?
I beg your pardon?
nothing. I'm sorry. Never mind.
I can't believe how quickly I nailed this.
am I really this good?
excuse me?
I mean, is it possible that...no.
no, nothing like this has ever happened before.
and nothing's going to happen tonight either.
how dare you think that I'm easy?
good-bye.
What--no. No, no, no. I'm not talking about you.
this is-- this is something much worse.
this is the first time I've been wrong about a case.
Gus, I'm telling you, it was too easy.
why would this wally guyslip up by stealing a detective's car from in front of a police station?
that doesn't make any sense.
sure it does.
one of his guys got sloppy.
Gus, I'm pretty sure I saw him smileas they loaded him into the squad car.
what, he thinks going to prison is dope?
no, come on.
I think I solved the crime I was supposed to solve.
not the crime I should've solved.
okay, you're not making any sense.
and I happen to be busy, so if you don't mind?
what are you doing? What is this? What, are you going somewhere?
Yes, actually, I am.
I finally havea free weekend.
which means I get to use the spa utopia package I won for being top sales rep.
it comes complete with town car and driver.
Gus, you've been bragging about that award for over a year--why go now?
maybe I kept pushing it back because I was always working a second job.
like when I had to enter a civil war reenactment?
or when I was protectinga sorority of pajama-clad coeds.
you're actually complainingabout that?
no, I'm not.
but let's not forget about the entire week I gave up riding shot gun to a cat, which, by the way, was not a boy cat at all.
that's some serious stress, Shawn.
I have to geta deep-tissue massage to work out all the knots in my back.
I call the big one"little shawn."
okay, that's the creepiest thing anyone's ever said to me.
they have a blind masseuse up there named Gloria.
I hear she works wonders. I can't wait.
what is it with you and the blind?
I remember you went crazy for that blind sculptor that did your bust.
that was Lionel Richiein the video for hello.
great.
now I'm gonna have that song stuck in my head.
good. Good-bye, Shawn.
chief!
we gotta reopenthe chop shop case.
I'm pretty sure we missed something.
first of all,"we" don't decide to reopen cases. I do.
that's what I meant.
morning, chief.-Morning.
uh, Lassiter, Mr. Spencer seems to think we might have missed something in the chop shop case.
no...no, that'san open-and-shut case if ever I've seen one.
sorry, Mr. Spencer, but if you want to reopen the case, you're gonna need to come up with some concrete evidence.
we don't devote department resources to personal whims.
Carlton, I finished the powerpoint slides for your 21-lespresentation.
this is...official department business?
Oh, you're right, helvetica is a much better font.
I know-- see how the m in "double murder suicide"just jumps off the page?
okay.
is there anyone left that I can actually speak to about this case?
like I said, there's still...
quite a fewunanswered questions.
well, what can I say? You guys got me fair and square. That's just it.
what kind of chop shop artist steals a cop's car and doesn't chop it up?
it's almost like you wanted to leave a trail.
leave a trail, don't leave a trail, wouldn't do any good.
you guys caught me quick.
snap! Mind of a cheetah. I was like,"what?" Cops are like, wham! Miranda.
Yeah, well, there's still some questions.
for instance, why haven't you posted bail, Wally?
Oh, it's all good. You know, I'm a just do my time. With good behavior.
and go on with my life.
till then, I'm like,"my bad!" The court's like,"get in that cell." Justice.
okay.
let's try this again.
prisoner 1906, visiting time is over.
gotta go.
your massage therapist will be right with you, Mr. Guster.
in the meantime, please relax. And hydrate.
thank you.
excuse me. Excuse me, do you mind?
Shawn, what are you doing here?
sorry.
Shawn, what are you doing here?
trust me.
the way today's going, I need to relax too.
I can't get the chiefto reopen the case.
I already-- I already told you I'm not helping you either.
you will when you hear this.
what?
I visited Wally.
in prison.
you went to the prison? - I went to the joint.
you went to the clink?
according to the visitors' log, the only other person who dropped by to see wally was Jonny G.
who turns out to be the Jonny G. of Jonny G' sbling it on custom auto shop.
so all he's guilty of it's a bad pun?
hardly.
first wally gets arrested for running a chop shop, then he gets visited by Jonny G.
who works in custom auto parts.
adds a whole new angle to the case, Gus.
look, is Jonny G gulity too?
what's the G stand for?
is Wally working for him?
what other criminal nonsense are they up to?
man, we may have just uncovered the tip of the iceberg here.
that's all you've got?
that...and this. It burns.
sitting here listening to you right now, little Shawn just got bigger.
I beg your pardon.
no thanks. -Fine.
what time are you seeing that blind chick?
Gloria can't see me.
dude, I know how being blind works.
I mean she's booked, Shawn.
I had to bookwith this girl named Kelly.
I hope she's good.
Mr. Guster.
are you ready for your massage?
call me Kel.
you know what, Kel?
I forgot I have another appointment I have to go to.
thanks for your time.
dude.
that dude's shoulders looked like two little baby heads.
I know.
okay, I'll help.
but I must be back in two hours.
that's when I booked the isolation chamber.
sweet.
we'll take your town car.
you're not naked under there, are you?
naked and unashamed.
Man...I'll be outside.
how are we gonna getthis information out of jonny G.
the dude thinks we're customers, Gus. It's a perfect cover.
I don't get it.
who wastes money tricking out a car?
it's frivolous and ridiculous.
not to mention it compromises the integrity of the vehicle.
yo, Shawn! Yo, lookin' good, man. Wassup, homie?
Jonny G.How are ya?-Good, man.
this is my friend, Ovaltine Jenkins.
Oh, respect, a'ight? What's up, o?- What's happening?
yo, check it out. Your ride is fresh to death.
always do the last checks myself, you know what I mean? Just to make sure it meets specs.
you know what I mean?- I do know what you mean.
all right.-You know what I mean?
what ride?
this one.
my car!
I told you it was the perfect cover.
that is fresh to death.
this is a company car, Shawn.
I have to visit clients in this.
would you relax?
I can't believe you spent all our money from the chop shop case on this.
what?
you couldn't find any magic beans?
a "Jack and the Beanstalk"reference?
Really?
you wasted our money.
I reinvested it in the business, Gus.
once we figure out what's up with Jonny G's shop and re-solve the case, we'll get another check.
and you want to know what we are going to do with it? Party like it's 1999.
no, we're gonna-- party.
Shawn.- Karamu?
no!- Fiesta?
we're gonna spend that money turning my car back to the way it was.
all right.
but I still don't see why you won't drive it like this.
Because!
it's embarrassing.
embarrassing?
dude, this is sweet.
this is fresh to death.
you won't enjoy it, I will.
what's up, ladies?
nice ride.
that's hot.
thank you.
you're hot!
you are so hot!
get out of my seat.
you said you didn't want to drive.
it's my ride, Shawn.
I'm driving.
just get us to the station.
I gotta convince the chief to let us snoop around jonny G's operations.
what now?
I'm gonna need your license and regis- - oh. Hey. Oops.
I-I didn't know it was you guys.
sorry, but in this car, you just happen to fit a profile.
I'm really sorry to bother you guys.
Heel!
Heel!
now I'm really, really sorry.
he's just a trainee for k9 unit.
obviously, he's not gonna make it.
sorry again, fellas.
and gus?
mauler barks at all cars.
not just blue ones.
Carlton, it's here!
is this the new nanomaterial vest we ordered for 21-les?
Yes, it's gonna kill.
the kev-tek 7000 "is made with nanomaterial polymers "that give it enough strength to stop a tank mortar shell.
I can't wait to try it out.
Oh, no, no, no.
last time, you got to be in capacitated by the sonic gun.
now it's my turn.
let go, o'hara.
Oh, come on.
O'har-- drop it!
just let me try it-- you know, I've had just about enough of the two of you.
you can both be shot. Just sign the waivers.
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo.
Sonny...was a cuckoo bird.
clearly he was cuckoo for something.
cocoa puffs.
exactly.
I always thought it was cuckoo puffs.
no, sonny is cuckoo for the puffs, which are cocoa.
that's why the milk turns all brown and chocolatey.
I was never allowed to eat that stuff when I was a kid.
that's why I don't have any cavities.
so, are we having cereal?
Yes.
but I'm getting more.
are these serial numbers?
Yes, but there's more.
I see shiny rims.
spoilers.
hammered rims.
Spencer, is this about the chop shop?
cause we told you, the case is closed.
now, hold on--this is very specific information.
O'hara, run the numbers by the crime lab, just to make sure we didn't miss anything in the sweep.
and you better not be wasting department time, Mr. Spencer.
because if you are, we'll be using these new vests on you.
that's a great idea.
thank you.
because that way, it's a plus for me whether they work or fail.
it better not take long for julietto run those numbers.
it won't.
I already missed all of yesterday on this already-solved case.
this is my last day to enjoy my vacation.
you don't realize how much stress I've been-- I'm not playing, Shawn.
I never get to do anything for myself.
I'm getting that massage.
and yes, I'll be naked and unashamed under my robe while they rub little Shawn down!
wait! It wasn't like that!
Jules, what do you got on those serial numbers?
well, the good news is, they tracked them to car parts.
the bad news is, the parts were purchased legitimately for bling it on.
and the even worse news is that Lassiter wants to know what size vest you wear.
very funny.
thanks for making my life more challenging.
the car parts at the shop were legit?
looks that way.
there must be something else going on down there that we're missing.
besides selling stolen car parts.
we gotta get back down there and look for clues.
I don't know about you, but I'm still on vacation.
looks like something's wrong with your in-dash DVD navigation and integrated surround sound system.
that was my speedometer.
now I can't seehow fast I'm going.
regardless, we've gotta take it back to jonny G to fix.
Hey, dude. Is Gonny G around?
uh, don't know.
we've been busy.
what you working on there?
getting this fleet ready to ship to Arizona.
okay, thanks.
and stealth mode.
what are we looking for, anyway?
anything that points to criminal activity.
you know...a white cloth sack with a green dollar sign.
a red barrel labeled "TNT." An anvil. Anything.
check this out.
what, you already have something?
the point of those examples was to imply it wouldn't be so obvious.
look how light it is.
awesome.
flavor Flav can wear it around his neck.
Flav wears clocks, not rims, Shawn.
why don't you put your phoneon vibrate?
dad, this is not a good-- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
okay, relax.
I will be right there.
we gotta go.-Go?
we either needto be working on this case, or I need to be back on my vacation.
he said he needed me there immediately.
I've never heard him sound this urgent.
I hope everything's okay.
here. Scale.
this was the urgent emergency?
Yeah--gotta get these on the grill before it's too late.
I can't believe you had me rush down here for this, dad.
I thought something was actually wrong with you.
what's wrong with you?
you remember how to scale, don't you, Shawn?
Yes, I remember how to scale.
you only made me do it 1,000 times as a kid.
a kid who didn't believe in animal cruelty, by the way.
those animals would've killed you dead, given the means.
all right, you scrape the scales, you don't bruise the flesh, you make an incision around the gill, and you fillet--down the spine.
very good. You do remember.
and Gus, you remember...
where the bathroom is.
you're taking me away from very important work right now.
I'll have you know I'm on the verge of uncovering something big, really big.
huge.
did you ever have a case you couldn't crack?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Of course. More than a few.
but a good detective learns the most when he doesn't get the bad guy.
no, I got the bad guy.
Oh, well, sometimes he gets off.
but a good detective doesn't let that get him down.
no, he's still in jail.
matter of fact, chief Vick even says it's my best work.
all right, then what's the problem?
it doesn't feel like my best work, you know?
it feels too easy.
did you ever have that problem?
no, Shawn, I don't recall any champagne problems like things being...too easy.
I don't know, I guess-- I just imagined my best work would be more complicated, you know?
More...intricate, important...and just more, you know, more.
as always, you go after something for the flash, for the excitement.
and when you finally get it, you're never satisfied. It always needs something more.
that is categorically untrue.
your best case, what does it need?
it needs more excitement.
your first bike, what did it need?
more reflectors-- well, Shawn, did you ever stop and think that maybe it's your expectations that need to change?
son, look at me. Look, Shawn.
sometimes, a case is just a case.
he's just a trainee for k9 unit.
wait a second.
wait a second.
I just figured it out.
wait, wait, don't--Shawn, don't do this.
Oh, this is much bigger than we thought. And I was right all along.
Shawn, don't you dare-- don't you dare learn a wrong lesson while I'm trying to teach you a right lesson!
look how light it is.
getting this fleet ready to ship to Arizona.
stop it--stop--stop--stop trying to figure it out.
stop jumping!
I can't help it!
it all makes sense!
Gus, we gotta go!
I'll explain on the way.
Shawn, Shawn, Shawn. You should be happy with a job well done, regardless of the excitement that it produces.
is that it?
Yeah, that's it.
is it a tight knot right under the shoulder blade?
Yeah, how'd you know?
Jonny G is smuggling drugs out of stateinside of car parts.
that's why those rimsat the office were so light, dude.
they were hollow!
and that's how he gets the drugs out.
and some of that residue must've gotten on your car, which is why that police dog went crazy barking at the wheels.
that's what wally's been covering for all along.
he's just a fall guy.
Jonny G's running the real operation.
drug trafficking.
we need to make it back to that shop before the evidence leaves for Arizona.
let's go!
damn it, we're too late.
somebody's here.
yo, Johnny
dude!
his foot is still on the accelerator.
stop!
this isn't funny.
you stop.
I can't!
the nitrous oxide canister's open.
laughing gas?
that stuff is deadly in high doses. At least we know what the cause of death is.
I can't believe Jonny G went out like that.
the police suspect foul play.
but so far, they have no leads.
all while I was on lock down?
guess I ended up with a better sentence than Jonny G did.
irony.
we still havea few questions.
what do you know about a shipment of custom cars on its way to...Arizona?
we were partners, but...jonny G. Was involved in a lotof stuff I didn't know about.
if I asked questions, he'd be like,"nunya." I'd be like,"okay." Relegate.
So--so--you're saying you weren't involved with the custom car shop at all?
I'm saying I was just a front man for the chop shop.
and now I'm doing my time.
but when I get out, crime's gonna be like,"come out and play, Wally. Come on."
I'm a be like,"no." Wally doesn't live here anymore. Reassimilated.
time's up.
dude.
I'm starting to thinkI was wrong about Wally.
when?
the first time or the second time?
both.
I think he's the mastermind behind this whole drug thing and Jonny G's murder.
but wally was in jail when Jonny G died.
Yeah.
he made sure of that.
this is a little awkward.
man, let's get outta here.
Wally made it easy for us to catch him because he wanted to get thrown in jail.
that way, he'd be locked up when he murdered Jonny G.
which would give him the perfect alibi.
with Jonny G out of the way, Wally assumes sole control of the custom car shop.
and the secret drug operation.
Hello, motive, my old friend.
get this.
according to public court records, Wally posted bail this morning.
why wait until now?
dude.
because the big drug deal goes down today.
but we don't know when or where.
Oh, yes, we do.
Yes, we do.
you call fleet feat trucking.
find out if they're making any custom car deliveries today.
find out when and where.
I'll go get Jules and Lassie.
dude, we got this!
as you will see, the tools in the arsenal of the modern-day detective are formidable, to say the least.
lights, please.
enjoy.
I pretended to be Jonny G's lawyer.
got the trucking company to tell me that a fleet from bling it on is expected to be dropped off at 2: 30.
I wrote the location down.
this says "in the middle of a field."
why did you have to write that down?
the address is on the back.
nice.
we don't--we don't have a lot of time.- Lights, please.
no.
scientific advancements in the mapping of the human genome, in the manipulation of the building blocks of matter itself, have taken law enforcement into the 21st century and beyond.
thank you.
thanks very much.
so, are there any questions?
Yes.
I thought you were gonna show us some new law enforcement techniques.
we've seen all these things on CSI.
well, I can assure you that this technology represents the latest available to police departments.
Oh, now you're onto something, Lassie!
nobody called for a psychic.
psychic?
awesome!
I'm getting a reading here.
it's strange.
Gus, what is this?
I think you may be magnetized.
right in the middle of my presentation.
wait, is he police sanctioned?
Yes.
Yes, he is.
because we at the Santa Barbarapolice department believe in using every tool in our arsenal to combat crime, and Mr. Spencer here is often undermy jurisdiction.
wait...
I'm getting a location.
it's an abandoned railroad track, but why?
please tell me, spirits of cutting-edge law enforcement technology.
I'm getting Michael Douglas.
the always under-appreciated Don Cheadle.
you know that's right.
traffic.
say hello to my little friend!
uh, Scarface.
they're all movies about drugs!
Yes!
drugs!
there must be a giant drug deal going down there!
right now!
we can send a squad car over to check it out.
fine.
there's no time!
it's happening in ten minutes.
we have to go now!
we can't get there in ten minutes.
I can.
let's roll.
can we come?
Yes, of course you can come. You wait out front. And we'll pull around for you.
it's been a pleasure doing business with you.-Thank you.
hold it! Get up against the car.
turn around! Up against the car!
look, we were just having a business transaction.
I was like,"here are your automotive parts, good sir," and he's like,"please, take my money."
capitalism.
come on.
Oh, Wally.
selling custom car parts is legal.
killing Jonny G to take over his drug operation...not legal.
I'm laughing.
entertained.
well, we try.
makes perfect sense, though. Knowing how much you resented Jonny G.
for not including you in the real business down at the shop, huh?
Jonny G. Was involved in a lot of stuff I didn't know about.
if I asked questions, he'd be, like,"nunya." I'd be like,"okay." Relegated.
you figured out a way to take him out and take over his entire enterprise.
you got yourself arrested because you knew that in jail, you'd have the perfect alibi when Jonny G showed up dead.
who would dare steal my car?
brilliantly planned this murder beforehand, knowing that Jonny G is a creature of habit.
I always do the final checks myself, just to make sure it meets the specs, you know what I mean?
you know what I mean?
that he personally inspects every single car on the day that it's supposed to be delivered, and that he is very, very thorough. So you figured out which canister of nitrous oxide he'd be using, and rigged itso it would leak when the gauge redlined.
very creative.
but unlike last time, there's no evidence.
the people's burden.
I'm sorry, Jules, what was that?
Oh, I didn't say anything.
you didn't say anything?- No.
well, who's the chatty Cathy with...back there in...nothing?
well, who's...who's talking?
some...
somebody that saw everything go down.
Wha--who--who is that?
who...
it's Bessie.
it's Bessie the mustang.
she's a female mustang. That doesn't make any sense.
technically, that would make her a...what?
that would be a filly.
a filly, everyone.
bessie is technically a filly, she--I'm sorry, what?
put his what in your what?
check inside Bessie's wheels.
check inside her wheels.
okay, stop.
you don't have a warrant. That's illegal seizure.
bill of rights.
very suspicious behavior.
probable cause.
nice, Jules.
it's drugs.
you are under arrest. But this time, it's for drug trafficking and murder.
guess that's three strikes.
Legislated!
Oh, nice, gus.
Oh, tell me about it.
Hey, dude.
Hey.
Yeah, we'd like to schedule a couple of massages with Gloria.
I'm sorry, but Gloria's still booked.
the only slot she has available is a couples' session.
No.-That's fine.
I mean...
no way.
thank you.
what's wrong with you?
dude, you're the one who said she's so amazing. I figured it was worth it.
me and you in the same room with just a towel between us?
not gonna happen.
she's blind. I figured it was worth it. That's naked and ashamed, Shawn.
maybe you're ashamed. Naked and ashamed.
what up, dipwads?
Oh, no, Jimmy Nickles!
gimme the money.
actually, we didn't bring it today.
here you go. - Gus!
give it up, Spencer.
or I'll shove a Jimmy Nickles and wich right in your grill!
I think it's a knuckle sandwich.
okay, okay.
and from the kangaroos?
see you tomorrow, butt munches.
it's Sloppy Joes and Tater Tots.
you know, Gus, one of these days, we're gonna stand up to Jimmy Nickles.
Yeah, I think I'll stay homesick that day.
it's about time.
sit down,
I have troubling news.
you forgot to tivo America's next top model, didn't you?
why is it so hard to set the season pass?
it's not top model related.
what is it?
Jimmy Nicholas called.
Jimmy Nickles called us?
from where? Prison?
I don't think so. It didn't sound like it.
what does prison sound like? Is there singing? - Shawn!
I don't know. He left a message.
don't you dare return that call.
I don't need to.
he's coming here in five minutes.
Jimmy Nickles coming here?
in five minutes? - Yeah.
okay, okay...
we can handle this.
we can handle this.
I'm gonna go print outa fake foreclosure notice and stick it on the front door.
and then we both can go outside and scrape the "psych" sign off the front window.
Gus, I think we can afford to relax a little bit.
he said he wants to talk, and by "talk."
I hope he means talk, not my head in a toilet.
he's gonna try and kill us.
he's not gonna kill us.
right?
I mean, people change.
we haven't seen him since the fifth grade.
I don't need to see him, Shawn.
some people are just born evil.
the kid from the omen, the children of the corn,
what is this?
Ooh, ebay!
auto bid.
600 bucks plus...
a penny--the penny's a trick.
I got in a full-on bidding war with a Montessori school.
what do we need a locker in the office for?
first of all, I have nowhere to put my sociology textbook.
and...
you always gotta hit it right on the nose, don't you?
why couldn't I be crockett?
because, Gus.
you stood in front ofthe entire third grade class and said,"when I grow up,
I wanna be Philip Michael Thomas."
dude, he's the biggest sausage in the world.
why is Jimmy Nickles coming here, Shawn?
how big is he now? - I don't know!
why couldn't you bea real psychic?
ey, you guys in there?
Oh, god, that's him.
he's not getting my lunch money, I'll tell you that much.
great, you can terrify him with your Wally Joyner mini-bat.
open the door.
what up, boys?
that's a good call with the mini-bat.
you d-bags gonna let me in or what?
D-bags?
Yeah, come on in, Jim.
huh!
way not to be scared, flincher.
I didn't flinch.
you know I have a caffeine tic.
look at this place.
video games, lockers.
you two haven't grown up at all, huh?
and you haven't grown up.
up...
at all.
Jimmy, as glad as we are to see you, what are you doing here?
what do you think I'm doing here, barfbeetle?
I came to take your lunch money.
hand it over!
I'm just messing around.
actually, I'm in town for, uh, work.
I'm sensing...
you became a jockey.
a jockey?
Yeah, one of the best jockeys.
Yeah, I won most of my races.
till this stupid Santa Barbara meet started.
now I'm on some ridiculous losing streak.
the last three favorites I've ridden have all lost.
and I know it wasn't something I did.
I started to lose all my best mounts.
Mounts?
horses, Guster.
what's wrong with you?
look, uh, Jimmy, what is it exactly you'd like for us to do?
well, uh, one of our friends from our old school told me about your company.
even though it sounds kinda gay,
I thought I could hire you to come down to the track and maybe, uh...
psychically figure out what's wrong with the horses.
okay, first of all, you ride on the back of mounts while carrying a whip.
that's much gayer than what we do.
either way, we're busy right now.
so I don't think - we'll be able to... -we'll take the case.
I thought so.
all right, meet me at the track at 2: 00.
and as far as anyone else knows, you guys are just some really good old friends.
got it, dillholes?
got it.
you can count on us dillholes.
good-bye, Jim.
are you crazy?
I wouldn't say crazy.
maybe an eccentric who looks good in jeans.
come on, gus, you're not actually still afraid of Jimmy Nickles, are you?
we're not helping that little monster, Shawn.
period. - Okay, so jimmy's still a jerk.
we can see that.
but the truth is...
I feel like I owe him.
for what?!
if anything, he owes us for 170 lunches.
you know, I added that up once, and with inflation, that's, like,$1, 800.
look, do you remember when Jimmy got kicked out of school in the fifth grade?
for killing a teacher?
for hitting miss Lepky with a spitball.
she fell and got hurt.
same difference.
she could've very well have been killed.
it was me who ratted him out, gus.
you did that?
why didn't you ever tell me?
you don't know all my secrets.
I'm a man of untold mysteries.
if he found out, he'd come back and gnaw off one of my toes.
ratting out Jimmy Nickles? That's suicidal.
I thought I saw him do it, and I told principal tropp, because he said he wasn't gonna let the class go until somebody gave him a name.
and what? You just had to get home?
dude, chips was gonna come on in, like, 20 minutes.
what was I supposed to do?
it was the one with the freeway crash.
where the car used the empty carcarrier trailer as a ramp and flipped in mid-air.
that happens in every episode, Shawn.
I was under a lot of pressure.
Jimmy Nickles did it! Your hair looks great
a: I always knew you were a kiss-ass.
and b: Who cares?
so Jimmy got kicked out.
it was the best day of my life.
I could finally wear underwear to school again.
I don't know, Gus.
I always sort of felt like I got the wrong guy.
I'll never forget the look on Jimmy's face when they hauled him out of class that day.
I didn't do it!
I promise, I didn't do it!
look, after jimmygot kicked out of school, there were all these stories about what happened to him.
he ran away from home, he got thrown in juvenile hall, moved to a small town in Kansas where they outlawe dsinging and dancing.
that last one is footloose.
that's a coincidence.
the point is, Jimmy's life changed that day, and I feel like I gotta make it up to him.
who knows, Gus, I might've stunted the kid's growth.
I don't know, Shawn.
we're talking about the same dude who made Aaron Rencher eat his own retainer.
all right, how about this
we take the case, right?
we prove, for all the Aaron Renchers of the world, we are no longer afraid of Jimmy Nickles.
all right, fine.
but if we take this case, we're gonna overcharge him by $1, 800.
done.
he doesn't like the oats.
or the alfalfa pellets.
they're too chewy for pellets.
pellets should be crunchy.
they should havea natural crunch to them.
also, the donkey in stable 11is a pathological liar.
this is idiotic.
look, it takes a while for the connection to take hold, Jimmy.
runny D. And i are just feeling each other out here.
whatever.
I gotta go lose five pounds before the next race.
you got half an hour to figure out what's going on.
what do you think, Runny D?
I'll tell you what he's thinking.
he's thinking, "I hate Jimmy."
he pulled my shorts down in front of Jenny Scarlatos in the cafeteria.
hmm?
are you channeling the horse?
or a little boy with a tight fade who used to wear his O. P.'S without a drawstring?
the horse, Shawn.
I didn't have a tight fade in the third grade.
Hey.
how are you?
that's interesting.
this place is weird and borderline depressing.
I mean, who are these people?
who actually comes here?
well, well, well.
this I never thought I'd see.
wow, dad.
tell me you're wearing that shirt because someone has to spot you from space.
very funny, Shawn.
this happens to be one of my lucky track shirts.
I like it.
I'd like it too, if I had to walk home in the dark.
this your kid?
Hey, kid.
Phil "the thrill" Shershow.
Shawn.
this is Burton "oil can" Guster.
good to meet cha.
Hey, Henry tell ya for 20 years,
I been handicapping horses?
that seems so very cruel.
he musta told ya I hit the pick six in '87?
hey Phil, I think it's pretty safe to assume,
I haven't told 'em anything.
five minutes to post. Gotta make it back.
Henry tell ya I likethe 2-3-4 trifecta box?
I think your shirt and his shirt should get together and go bowling.
ha ha.
you have all kindsof interesting pals.
I don't know about.
all right, Shawn, look, don't start. Phil is not a pal.
he's a bad gambler who doesn't know when to quit.
but he also happens to be on a hot streak right now, which is why I let him talk to me.
not that I need it.
I have won 8 of 11 races today.
all by myself.
all right, Shawn what are you doing out here anyway?
I tried to drag you out here for years.
I'm only here today'cause we're working on a case.
you know, I think the reason you never came out here is because to bea good handicapper, you gotta put in the time, you gotta do the research, you gotta study the horses, you gotta study the jockeys.
something that takes patience and follow-through, which you lack.
Yes.
that and a shirt from Mr. Furley's closet.
[Male announcer over P. A.] And the race is on.
babyfaced assassin takes the early lead.
babyfaced assassin strides into the first...
so what's the case?
have you ever heard of a Jimmy Nickles?
you mean Jimmy Nicholas.
Yeah, solid jockey, bad bet.
he's been losing lately.
that's why he hired us.
Yeah, the horses are losing, that's what's wrong with them.
Yeah, we didn't find anything.
of course you didn't, there's a million reasons a horse loses, and none of 'em have to do with crystals and moonbeams.
and it's youthful spirit.
youthful spirit pulls it out.
what I do is much more than that.
it's...it's intuition.
son, you got no case.
Oh, well, thanks. We'll just go home then.
help him!
medical assistance to the track.
we need medical assistance to the track immediately.
so...
a jockey who was alive at the beginning of the race is dead by the end.
not to sound insensitive, but I say we do have a case.
that sounds insensitive.
Yeah, I know.
and you guys just happened to be at the track?
Jules, it's free Churro day.
do they havea cause of death yet?
probable heart attack.
uh, O'hara, I...
need you to interview the rest of those jockeys.
what is that?
sorry.
it's just little people make me...
well, let's just say I had a bad experience with a Christmas elf.
what, he didn't give you the right present?
no. We dated.
she is an enigma wrapped in a little, blonde riddle.
Shawn, I don't think Juan Carlos died of a heart attack.
I only got to see him for a second, but I'm pretty sur ehe had bloodshot eyes.
and his bodywas totally stiff.
something affected his nervous system.
thank you, Dr. Pratt.
see if we can get another look at that body.
you bet.
Hey, you two, don't go anywhere.
I wanna talk to you when I'm done.
Gus has a cramp.
I have a cramp?
we have to pee.
fine, just be back in five minutes.
we gotta pee?
that's the best you can come up with?
just hurry up.
Really?
how short was this guy? Give it one more.
we have boots.
wait. Everyone stop.
let's acknowledge that the chief is wearing leopard print.
and continue.
I'm getting something.
no.
a rocket. Rikki Rocket.
C. C. Deville.
david Lee Roth? - Wrong band.
poison. - Yes.
poison.
he's right.
what? - You're right.
espinoza had a cocktail of drugs in his system.
opiates, barbiturates, cocaine, three different kinds of weight loss drugs, cyalis, and horse tranquilizers.
horse tranquilizers?
apparently, the guy took everything in sight.
he was 4'9" and 3 feet of that were drugs.
and obviously, his heart couldn't handle it.
a very thorough job, detectives.
I'm getting something else.
Shawn, how do you know this?
well, come on, who didn't?
anyone who wasn't an eight-year-old girl.
Uh-oh. I see a tall, blonde woman.
brigitte Nielson?
No!
she has 23 diamonds in her wedding ring.
shouldn't we at least find this woman and talk to her?
do you know anything about this, detectives?
your childhood must've been pure hell.
the good news,
I'm available for hugs.
Jules. How about it?
buddy. It's been a while.
please.
you're here early.
Yeah, couldn't sleep, you know?
came in early, did a little work on the case.
went for a run.
Oh, and I did this.
nice.
I did some work as well.
which doesn't make any sense.
cause Ketamine causes a stateof anesthesia.
the spitball incident?
Shawn, you need to leave that alone.
if you haven't figured it out by now, you never will.
I can't leave it alone. I won't.
I've gone over it in my head a thousand times.
just hear me out.
what are you doing here?
this is my head, dude. I can do whatever I want.
what did we miss? What's going on here?
is that what my hair looks like in the future?
it sure is.
but I thought I'd be bald by 20.
this changes everything.
Yeah, it does. Think big.
Ahh!
it was Jimmy.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
he's sipping through the straw, not spitting it out.
it couldn't have been him.
there was a second spitter.
that's so cool.
let it go, Shawn.
your second spitter theory is crazy.
Oh yeah, what about your teen wolf theory?
Hey, that's just a fact.
if any of us were in high school and some dude became a wolf, we wouldn't be cool with him just because he could dunk a basketball.
Oh, save it for your podcast.
Hey, you brought it up.
I'm gonna go talk to Jimmy Nickles.
you look for T. B.W.
T. B.W? - Tall blonde woman.
I abbreviated, Gus. All the kids are doing it these days.
Oh.
just hope we don't run into my--Y. D?
y. D?Your dad.
and it's too late.
Oh, my god, the shirt has a brother.
ha, very funny, Shawn.
Seriously? I wonder why.
isn't that Barry Sarner?
the announcer guy. He's like a local legend.
Yeah,"the voice," right? - Yeah.
Hey, dad, do you know him? Can you introduce us or what?
no, I met him once at a policeman's ball, but it was years ago.
Hey, uh, Mr. Sarner. - Hi.
look who's here.
your old pal.
do I know you?
no, but we know you.
what is it you always say?
and the race is on.
and the race is on.
and the race is...
on!
Hey, can you do it for us one time?
and the race is on.
that's it, right there.
won't you boys have a button?
I'm sorry, Mr. Sarner.
I'm Henry Spencer.
this is my son Shawn and his friend Gus.
they finally just started coming to the races.
Oh, too bad.
the track's probably closing down after this meet.
25 years I've been doing this.
why is it closing down?
well, no one comes anymore.
is it because of his shirt?
I'm sorry, dad, this is, like, a genocide of color.
somewhere, a rainbow's weeping.
Mr. Sarner,
we're his buddies. We came down to see him.
no, uh...
it's a shame, really.
Jimmy was just getting back to a full schedule.
Really? We didn't know that.
Oh, they quarreled about it all the time.
did they?
Shawn, look.
way to stay on the abbreviation train, Gus.
you mean the A. T?
you're talking about Janine? - That's Jimmy's wife.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I didn't kill Juan Carlos!
I didn't do it, I swear!
come on!
you gotta believe me!
back off.
okay, so let me get this straight.
you took on this case because you felt bad that led to Jimmy being arrested for murder.
did I ask for nutshelling?
I think he looks like a tangelo in that outfit.
or maybe a Klementine with seeds full of hate.
I think he looks like an evil little creamsicle.
you mean dreamsicle.
no, Shawn, creamsicle.
they're exclusively orange.
okay, Lassiter says you can have five minutes with Jimmy.
sweet.
and good job, by the way.
you didn't tell Jimmy that, did you?
no.
I didn't kill Juan Carlos.
we know.
someone must've tipped'em off.
but I swear I didn't do it.
guys!
look...
I think what Gus is trying to say is we'd really like to help.
we would, but the evidence.
what?
Juan Carlos took all your mounts. - Yeah.
you fought with him over it. - Yeah.
they found Ketaminein your locker.
that wasn't mine.
all right, Purvis, put me down.
don't push me.
I'm getting the feeling he didn't know about the affair.
you think?
I'm sorry, I just
I can't believe she would do that.
especially after I told her
I wouldn't sleep with any more russian models.
I think we may have gotten off point, Jimmy.
let's go back to the beginning.
so is there anything else you can tell us or that you remember about those races?
no. The horses were all running great.
but right around the, uh, clubhouse turn, they all faded down the stretch.
all of them faded down the stretch?
you know what?
Yeah.
good.
that's a good place to begin.
all right, that's enough, Shawn, let's go.
you've been standing at that thing for an hour.
let me take off my shoes and try it lying down.
no, Shawn. You don't have anything.
it's a dead end. Face it.
we have to tell Jimmyhe's screwed.
fine. You tell Jimmy. - Me?
I never wanted to take this case in the first place.
I'll race you for it.
What?! No.
that's right. And I know why.
Why?
please!
first of all, you know I hadsh in splints, a torn meniscus, and a planter's wart.
you have no idea what they mean!
ask my doctor.
I had a ruptured patella too, but I wasn't gonna say anything.
besides...
go! - Oh, no!
no, you didn't! Oh!
you almost had me.
what? I had you by at least a foot.
I'm gonna give this to you.
I thought so.
not because you won.
what?
Oh, no. We're going again.
I got a better idea.
Gus, this is the perfect spot for us to see you'll find
to see where the magic happens.
I told you he'd be here.
can I help you fellas?
uh, yeah, uh...
and the race is on.
I really don't think you should be up here right now.
Ooh, can I do one?
I've always wanted to be an announcer.
would the owner of a red iroc-z
and turn off your headlights.
what do you think of that, huh?
have a button.
Hey.
I've seen one of these before.
Yes, it's a shaman's staff.
Yeah, I saw a specialon the history channel...
about the--the Choctaw Indians.
ah yes, the Chaka Indians.
long-standing rivals of the sleestak cowboys.
it's pronounced choe-koe.
gave us the chocodile, amongst other things.
I don't think so.
I'm actually 1/16 Indian myself, but not Cherokee.
Hey, Gus is...1/16 robot.
Mm.
Oh. Sorry.
Hey, you're the guy that tried to save Juan Carlos.
yeah...
you're the only one who tried to help.
Yeah.
uh, he died.
Yes, he did do that.
Yeah.
well, gentlemen, uh...
Ryan and I have to go oversome publicity photos.
so if you'd be kind enough...
and the race is on!
Chaka? Really?
Yeah, I'd be embarrassed if I were you.
I'm not embarrassed at all, Gus.
a land of the lost reference is virtually unheard of in everyday conversation.
can we go and see Jimmy now?
not yet.
Barry has tapes of the races in there.
which means there's a copy of the one Juan Carlos died in.
I don't know why I didn't think of this before.
we need to see that tape.
there's no way Barry's gonna let us back in there.
don't the police hav ea copy of it?
they do, but Lassiter'sc onvinced the case is closed, so he won't help.
which means I'm gonna have to do something I know I will regret.
what? Ride your dirt bike off of David King's roof again?
no...
ask my dad for a favor.
so I was hoping that in your very meticulous, detailed mode, it occurred to you to...
I can't do it.
he wants to know if you tape all the horse races.
of course I do.
awesome. Can we watch the one when Juan Carlos died?
you may.
on one condition.
deal is you go with me to the Derby on Sunday in that shirt.
what did I say about regret, Gus?
what did I say?
I think you pull it off.
fine.
all right, here's the race.
Juan carlos is on the number eight horse.
the one time I go with the guy, and the horse loses.
I don't get it. What are we missing?
What--what aren't we seeing?
maybe nothing.
maybe Jimmy did poison Juan Carlos.
I know he didn't poison Juan Carlos, just like I know there's a second spitter.
close your eyes.
you need to broaden your vision, Shawn.
you need to lookat the outskirts of the case.
what does that even mean?
broaden my vision?
look at the outskirts of a-- you know what?
I'm out of here. No.
no, no. Not today.
you sound like Oprah.
I don't even know why I bother coming here.
it's a complete waste of time.
a little girl outside just started crying when she saw this shirt.
Oh, good, good, you're here.
you texted me seven times.
said it was an emergency.
Yes, a color emergency.
but I think I figured it out.
the walls were sandbar white to suppress all creative thought and hide the asbestos.
the walls of what?
miss Lepky's classroom.
why is my nameon the detention list?
you got caught eating a kit kat out of the trash can.
the point is, when I left my dad's...
you mean stormed out like a little girl?
I did not.
I did.
I'd give you that.
I realized my dad was actually right.
I needed to broaden my vision, and that's when I remembered we all switched seats in class that week.
right, I had to sit behind Janie Doran and her creepy neck hair.
and Jimmy...
moved over two rows, meaning that the second spitter was on the other side.
Gus, get him.
Shawn, what does this have to do with horse racing?
Mm-mm, I haven't gotten that far yet.
let me know when you figure it out.
let go, Jimmy.
Hello?
dude, I figured it out.
was that really necessary?
no.
but it was dope.
babyfaced assassin strides into the first turn at the head with none other right on its tail.
babyfaced assassin -wait for it.
babyfaced assassin...
right there! The clubhouse turn.
Juan Carlos gets hit by something.
I was so focused on the stretch that I never looked anywhere else.
you know, I didn't broaden my vision, dad.
Shawn, I love nothing more than to tell you I'm right, but I have no idea what I'm right about.
question is why would somebody kill someone like that?
guys!
Juan Carlos's death was an accident--yeah!
whatever hit him was meant for a horse.
this isn't about murder.
it's about fixing races.
the tapes ready? - Check.
fake psychic ability? - Full of it.
Yes, you are.
Mr. Spencer, what is going on?
first you help us get--oh.
get Jimmy Nicholas.
now you claim he's innocent?
I'm sorry, chief.
psychic solar flares have temporarily blinded me.
lilacs in a meadow.
is that camay?
my eyes are starting to adjust.
where are we?
we're in the video room!
I'm blind, Gus. Not deaf.
if you wanted
those tapes.
what are on those tapes?
they're the tapes from the track.
we reviewed them, but we didn't find anything.
Doritos. Big gulp?
Slurpee.
7-11?
these are all the dates on the tapes.
let's play these tapes.
these are Jimmy's races.
this one is when Juan Carlos died.
that must be why they're in my head.
all of these horses faded down the stretch, as if affected by something.
and look here.
he felt the effects immediately, because he's a tiny human person.
and your point is?
whatever hit Juan Carloswas intended for his horse.
what I'm saying is that this was an accident.
Mr. Spencer, that's a very interesting theory, but it's all circumstantial.
we're gonna need some hard evidence.
Yeah, but thanks for the A. V. Class.
youthful spirit fades down the stretch.
no, wait, he's-- he's gaining.
it's youthful spirit, youthful spirit pulls it out.
youthful spirit fades down the stretch.
no, wait, he's-- he's gaining.
it's youthful spirit pulls it out!
the announcer.
it's the announcer.
he sounds surprised.
"Neigh," shocked.
youthful spirit fades down the stretch.
no, wait, he's-- he's gaining.
that means he's a part of it.
chief, every psychic nerve in my body tells me that something really big is gonna happen at the Derby tomorrow and that we all need to be there.
all right.
it's too late to cancel the races, but I can approve a police presence at the track.
I've never been in the jockey club before, Shawn.
thanks for getting me in here.
it's a good thing we wore our lucky shirts, huh?
Yeah, just worried someone's gonna stare directly at the pattern and have a seizure.
Shawn, we've had people watching Barry for the last six races, and they haven't seen anything out of the ordinary.
admit it, you guys don't have it.
don't worry. We have it.
I don't know if we have it.
we just gotta figure out how it all connects.
so what is this indian stuff I got off the internet connect to?
that's what we in the fake psychic community call a hunch.
ladies and gentlemen, the horses have reached the starting gate and the race is on.
Uh-oh, two horses bump as they come out of the gate.
it's the three horse, snare the prize, and the four, biased opinion.
Kate's conscience takes the early lead as the horses reach the first turn.
authority figure makes a strong move on the inside as the horses race down the backstretch.
authority figure begins to take control.
authority figure...
Phil is not a pal.
he's a bad gambler who doesn't know when to quit.
but he also happens to be on a hot streak.
Henry tell ya I like the 2-3-4 trifecta box? Huh?
track's probably closing down after this meet.
25 years I've been doing this.
dude, I got it. Get everyone down to the track.
and authority figure wins with ease.
I really would like to cash in my tickets now.
well, how did she feel coming around the backstretch?
everybody hold your horses.
I meant metaphorically, but I like the love.
I sense the plan.
hatched from the desperation of watching the track they all love so much shuttered forever.
isn't that right...
excuse me?
you are so not excused.
you see, the track is closing down this year, and Barry finally figured out a way to get paid.
but it was the equine who told me he had help.
two people with intimate knowledge of the races and access to the entire track.
they figured out how to control the outcome of the races by getting rid of the favorites.
they bet on the rest of the field,
that is insane.
we didn't do anything.
that's not entirely true. Whoa.
whoa, what's happening here?
Gus, little help, buddy.
I don't do horses, Shawn.
Dale, uh, hold that thought.
what was I saying?
Barry was saying they didn't do anything.
Really?
you used Phil to make all the bets on the long shots.
and Ryan here
well, he took careo f knocking out the favorites from his perch in the camera well.
with what, his camera?
exactly.
lassie, do me a favor.
take that camera off Ryan's neck.
give it a look.
there's no lens.
it's some kindof firing mechanism.
I just wanted to make some money.
it was Barry's idea.
shut up, Ryan. They can't prove anything.
I'm getting something.
a fraction.
Barry's 1/16 choco Indian.
and what are the choco Indians known for?
besides chocodiles.
for using blowguns to kill animals with darts dipped in poison.
Gus shoots and scores.
with an assist from wikipedia.
they used dartsdipped in Ketamine.
a horse tranquilizer strong enough to slow down a horse in the middle of a race.
with darts small enough to be missed on a 1,000-pound horse.
but the problem was...
they accidentally shot Juan Carlos.
the Ketamine, mixed with all the other drugs in his system, and the adrenaline from the race killed him.
you weren't trying to save Juan Carlos's life.
you were looking for the evidence.
and they almost pulled it off by framing poor Jimmy.
but they couldn't resist one more big pay day in today's race.
it's like my dad always says...
real men take bubble baths.
and...
a bad gamblernever knows when to quit.
not bad, kid. Not bad.
let's go. Get 'em out of here.
now...
who wants to take a picture withthe winning horse and jockey?
come on, dad! Gus, get over here.
memories, Shawn. That's what it's all about.
just act natural. Yeah.
guys, I don't know what to say.
I guess you're not such total fart knockers after all.
Thanks.
That's...so sweet.
Gus, isn't there something you wanted to say to Jimmy here?
Yes, I do.
I've been wanting to say thi sfor a long time.
you know, back in school.
Oh, uh, about that.
I had some time to think while I was in jail, and, uh...
maybe I didn't treat you guys so good back then.
especially you, Guster.
so I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for giving you wedgies, swirlies, Jimmy Nickle sandwiches, stuffing you in the trash can and, uh...
putting boogers in your clarinet case.
feels good to get that off my chest after all these years.
huh, yeah. I could imagine.
say, Shawn, isn't there something you want to get off of your chest?
are you gonna tell him if I don't?
what do you think?
all right, Jimmy, here's the thing.
I'm the one that ratted you out over the spitball incident.
okay, I'm the one that got you kicked,
and I am the one that you should blame for almost ruining your life, it was me.
almost ruining my life?
Yeah, I went to live with my dad in Maui.
he let me do anything I wanted.
I ate pizza and cookie dough for breakfast.
I had a race car bed.
I lost my virginity at 13.
it was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
you two are back together, huh?
dude, she's a former Miss Oxnard with no sense of smell, and her dad owns an airport.
course we're back together.
Latro, boys.
okay, see...
that right there makes total sense in the world.
Yeah, but we can feel good about solving the case.
eh...
don't you "eh" me.
dude, I broke up a highly intricate race-fixing syndicate
Yes, yes, you did, Shawn.
Gus. - Yes?
you didn't.
Yes, I did.
you did that?
and you never told me about it?
you don't know all my secrets, Shawn.
I guess I too am a man of untold mysteries.
I am seeing you in a completely different light.
you are, dare I say, dastardly.
Hey, I didn't want Miss Lepkyto get hurt or anything, but when Jimmy got blamed, my mouth was shut.
unbelievable.
face it, Shawn.
I am, and always will be, that good.
that's why my friends in school used to call me "the G."
huh, that's funny, I thought they called you "big head burton."
don't you ever say that name.
I know it was youth at started that.
I'm sorry, Gus. I have a knack for alliteration.
I'm a slave to it.
besides, how many words start with B, really?
about 1, 000.
how about Bold? Black? Beautiful?
who's gonna call you"black burton"?
you get my point, Shawn. - All right.
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna buy you an ice cream.
and we're gonna discuss some new, fresh to death nicknames.
how about...
Burton, "the billowy bear"?
what?
I'm just spitballing. It's my first shot.
he starts doing his thing, twisting and turning.
there's all sorts of fluids just spraying all over the place.
then this hydraulic lift comes into play, wheeling everything out of there.
there you have it. All right?
let's clean up.
wait. That's how babies are born?
yes?
with a hydraulic lift?
more or less.
wait. But how are they made?
uh, sean, more important question, how many hats are in the room?
none. How are they made?
hats? Nowadays, I hear most of them are made in China. Let's go.
forget it.
maybe I'll go ask mom.
D-don't, no! No. Wait, wait, come back here.
come back here, come back here. All right.
tuck in your shirt before you talk to her.
present day all right, tell me exactly what she said. Use her words.
she said, hello. This is chief vick.
it's a good start, Gus. I love it when she says that.
I have something big to talk to you about. It's top secret.
come down to the station as soon as you can.
do you realize what this means? It means we're taking it to the next level.
she said big and top secret. That's two of our favorite 80s movies.
I read about the internationalyacht bandit.
I bet you we're going undercover on a yacht.
Gus, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
she may want us to catch that guy who's been stalking Lingerie models.
I know what it is. Last night on the news, I saw something about a blimp.
blimp rides shotgun. You can't call shotgunon a Blimp.
you can call shotgun anywhere except a crowded movie theater.
all right, close the blinds, shut the door, and remain completely silent.
this is big.
this is big.
look, I'm trusting you both to be professional and to keep this matter completely confidential.
you got it.
if you knew how many secrets I was keeping from you already, you'd totally trust me.
it involves a nanny.
nanny serial killer.
nanny on the run?
nanny arsonist?
does she fly a blimp, by chance?
no. I need you to hire me a nanny.
our big case is finding you a nanny for your baby?
well, I'd be hiring you privately, of course.
but I cannot stress how important this is.
of course. Our children are our most precious resources.
Yes. That.
also, I haven't slept in weeks.
see, my nephew was nannying her.
and then he went back to nursing school.
and ever since he left, she won't fall asleep, which means that I don't fall asleep.
are you up for this job?
I...
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.
see, I can run the background checks on the nannies.
of course, not to mention, the drug testing, the psychological briefings.
but I want to hire you both to psychically read the best candidate.
look, chief. With all due respect,
I think our services might be better utilized
your services are best utilized by doing exactly what I say.
you are not my first choice, Mr. Spencer.
and I cannot stress how important this is.
all right, so, uh, while we're looking for this babysitter
nanny. - nanny.
how about we also hop onboard the yacht bandit case?
because I think...
Oh, no. No, no, no. No, no way.
if I'm hiring you privately, then this is the only case that you're going to be working on.
I mean, when you're working on police cases, it's not like you take private cases as well.
or do you?
no. - No.
of course not. - We don't do that.
that would be unprofessional. - It would break the psychic/client...
we wouldn't even think of it.
code. - Great.
you can go ahead and leave the door open.
well, harry, you and Deeshaw start a timeline.
Mcnab, I want you to help Schwartz go over the witness statements.
I want you on tactical!
where the hell is Dobson?
look, Gus, a real case.
what do you have?
something something Lassiter's case.
dude, this blows with a capital Z.
Shawn, this is the only casewe're supposed to be working on.
besides, it's really important.
nannies are essential parts of today's working nuclear families.
they're babysitters who drive.
might I remind you that this is a private case for the chief of police to find a caretaker for her child?
if we screw this up, we'll be on her bad side for pretty much ever.
Gus, you're not going to find a nanny on the internet.
if they're posting there, they're already too desperate. It's like online dating.
remember when you went on matchmaker.com?
you mean when you posted a profile of me without my knowledge?
right--and all the women who responded were complete freaks.
that's because you said I was looking for a woman who was strong enough to hold me.
I didn't think they would take it literally.
look, dude, all the good nannies are employed.
we gotta do some field work.
we gotta find the right nanny and steal her for chief vick.
we should go to a playground in a really good neighborhood.
that's actually a good idea.
plus this way, we can race on the monkey bars.
you know, Gus, we may be working the lowest stakes case of our short careers, but there's something nice about just sitting and enjoying a sunny day at the park.
Shawn, concentrate.
look over there. The one in the overalls.
she seems to be using reverse psychology on that ten-year-old, which is actually a pretty good idea.
you know what's not a good idea?
what?
pineapple and movie theater popcorn flavored jelly beans.
that's disgusting.
Shawn, stop spitting. You're scaring the children.
Hi. Would you like some candy?
I can't say that I blame her.
these are disgusting. I mean, these are really horrible.
why can't I stopeating them?
that's it. We're splitting up.
you're freaking out the kids. And me.
fine.
thank you for that. I'm serious.
I mean, I thought this was supposed to be a safe neighborhood.
just because you're rich doesn't mean you're safe.
Marissa, get off of her now!
so you know annie, she worked for the Bermans.
she had to goto the police station because they thought she might be a material witness 'cause of when the house by them got robbed.
So--Dakota! Let someone else go on the slide!
they spoil that little girl so hard.
so then, an
Perry! Luke! I'll be sitting right here.
remember, stranger danger!
stranger danger. The parents make me say that.
Hi, I'm Shawn. I'm, uh, I'm a manny around here.
Oh, I'm Ada. This is Jaynie.
are you with an agency?
no, I don't model. Strictly a manny.
um, no, most of the families in this neighborhood get their nannies from our agency.
Oh, which one is that?
red balloon. You should talk to them about getting reassigned.
ada's freaking out because she doesn't feel safe working in the heights anymore.
why not? Oh, gosh. Is there a lot of crime around here?
what kind?
just some burglaries.
just? All these houses.
only three.
three that we've heard about.
they all happen in, like, the middle of the day, and all of them had security systems and everything, and it didn't matter.
Yeah, but it's not like it's your stuff they're stealing. So what do you care?
I don't like to be around it.
Cody! Moving, get your footout of that dog!
Hi. - Hi.
which one is yours?
Oh, uh, I'm the nanny for those two.
Oh, really. Do they always fight that?
pretty much.
which one's yours?
Oh, no kids. Just me.
so what are your thoughts on discipline?
do you spank?
here you go.
thank you. - You're welcome.
is that your nanny right there?
no. She is.
so she doesn't always pay attention to where you are, huh?
it would be pretty easy for you to get away and she wouldn't even know.
kids. I just want to eat 'em up.
none of these nannies will talk to me. Even the kids are avoiding me.
tell me the truth. Do I smell weird?
Nah, it's just the usual. Jerk chicken and new car smell.
look, I was talking to those two nannies, right?
Oh yeah? You think they maybe right for chief vick?
Nah. They're terrible. Yelling at the kids, gossiping.
all they paid attention to themselves.
but here's the good news, this neighborhood is rife with crime.
see what I mean?
Shawn, I think you're forgetting why we're here.
did you really just do that?
what?
Hey, guys!
listen, I got a call about two creepy dudes hanging out in the playground.
really. I haven't seen anything.
but I'll keep my eyes open.
Yeah, we've just been here hanging out in the bushes.
Oh, boy.
sorry about this.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, no hard feelings, right?
of course not.
I mean, if you have to have a Jackie Earle Haley moment, you'd--you want it to be from bad news bears.
maybe breaking away.
not little children.
listen, I'd be happy to give you guys a ride to wherever you need to go.
attention all officers. We have a call on a 4-5-9 break-in at 3192 roscoe.
there. We need to go there.
you need to go to a crime scene?
Yeah, it's crazy.
the chief asked us to look into any new burglaries in the neighborhood while we were here...
at the park.
okay. Fine. Hop in.
no. Why you always get to sit in the front?
I called shotgun.
no, you didn't. - Shotgun.
chief Vick better notcatch us here, Shawn.
would you relax? She's not gonna show up at some random burglary scene.
we spent all afternoonon that nanny thing.
this is like a coffee break.
the coolest coffee break ever.
this is so wrong, Shawn.
that must be why it feels so good.
we already have a case.
Gus, we can do both. It's called multitasking.
okay, looks like somebody came home. Kicked off their shoes.
made some chamomile tea.
what ever happened to throwing back a few beers after work?
whatever happened to cleaning?
this is disgusting.
whoever broke in, managed to disarm security, find the safe and open it.
and killed a guy.
so this is where Mr. Teatime got steeped.
that doesn't even make sense.
got brewed?
got tea bagged!
that must bewhat killed him.
good eye, Gus.
thank you.
so Mr. Teatime wasn't feeling well.
he comes home early, surprises the intruder.
the murderer didn't have a weapon. Reaches for the first thing he can find.
bam. Didn't mean to hurt anybody.
he's just a normal thief, right?
Dude--I bet this is connected to those robberies the nannies were talking about.
chief Vick!
man, we gotta get out of here.
I think walking like this makes everything more exciting.
I do not think this is a good idea.
she was clear about only wanting us to find her a nanny.
are you kidding me?
I'll have a psychic vision about the whole string of robberies.
she will love it.
I haven't finished the report yet.
is your other arm in a sling?
excuse me?
I don't want excuses, Carlton. I just want the report.
I'm not giving excuses.
then why are you still talking?
head detective, my ass.
uh, listen, I can finish the report.
I can do my own job, O'hara.
I know you- - I can do my own job, O'hara!
who finished the coffee, didn't make a fresh pot?
I mean, who does that?
what kind of person acts like that?
Ooh, Shawn, Gus, hi! Good to see you.
come on in. Come on in.
so you found me a nanny.
actually, we were working on that when- - I had a vision.
it was a robbery turned to murder. There's a light
Oh, do you know who the murderer is?
unless you can name me the murderer in ten seconds, then I'm not interested.
ten, nine, one. I hired you to find me a nanny, and that's it.
Yes, that's it.
Absolutely. But, chief, I have this feeling.
Mr. Spencer, I thought you understood that when I hired you, this was to be your top priority.
your only priority.
it is. This is it.
in fact, we even narrowed it down to the final three candidates.
go find three candidates.
this has to be connected to the other burglaries in the heights.
don't even think about it.
no, you go ahead. I'm just going to saya quick hello.
okay.
hold on a second. I might need to make that a large.
can I help you?
you guys want to go in with me on a meat-lover'scheesy crust?
no time for a pizza party, Spencer.
nothing helps a big case more than a belly full of pepperoni.
we're busy. - Okay.
keep it a medium, but yes to the crazy bread.
it makes sense that all these burglaries were connected 'cause they all have the same M. O. S.
daytime burglaries... - daytime burglaries.
hidden valuables found and stolen. Disabled alarm systems.
Yes. That's what I was in the middle of saying.
well, then say it.
uh, hold on a second.
walk away.
okay.
thank you very much for your time.
now if you all can just wait here for one sec.
Shawn, I'm glad you're here.
excuse me.
I'm feeling really good about these nannies.
Jean has a background in Montessori, and sue has some interesting ideas about establishing nap time routines that I kind of like.
all right.
no. No good. None of them.
what? Why?
slob, psycho, slut.
I spent hours interviewing them, calling references.
and you just come in here and dismiss them in two seconds?
well, take a look, Gus. The one on the far left is a slob.
she's smelling her own armpit.
psycho there has been scribbling in her diary from the moment I walked in.
so? Maybe she'sjust creative?
it's the same sentence over and over again.
now, I don't know what that sentence is, but there is no configuration of words that makes that behavior acceptable.
fine. That still leaves Fiona.
why is she a slut?
that was more me predicting her future.
Aw, man. - What?
all right, everybody out.
sorry, ladies. The position has been filled.
don't drive angry.
why did you do that?
Gus, she was getting married.
so? She can still work for Chief Vick.
no, she's consumed with planning her wedding.
she was studying that bridal magazine like it was a textbook.
after she's done with that, she'll be on the fertility fast track.
then she'll have her own baby.
and chief vick will be out another nanny.
and I do not want to have to do all this work again.
and what work exactly are you doing?
how about progress on our actual case?
looks like all these robberies are inside jobs.
the key is finding the connection between the victims.
but we don't know anything about the other houses that were robbed.
all I'm saying is...
I'm just trying to say...
don't make me slap you, Shawn.
check it out. I got some snapshots of the evidence.
well, at least two of the victims have something in common.
what?
security company.
and you don't find it strange that all four of these homes had startek security, yet none of them were secure?
actually, people get over confident with a security system and neglect taking even the most basic precautions.
like turning the system on, for example.
so you're saying all of these homeowners just forgot to turn on their alarms?
that's one theory.
that's a pretty flimsy theory.
Yeah, I don't think that's what happened.
what I'm going to need from you, spock, is a list.
I just told you, yes, I am second in command.
but my name is Gary Mills.
I'm at a loss. You'll have to talk to bones and get back to me.
why are you here?
well, I was just in the neighborhood and my ears started tingling.
and then they got pointier.
Oh, and my hand. My hand started doing this. All on its own.
like in that show.
star trek.
and this is startek. Hilarious. What's your point?
excuse me for trying to take you on a wonderful psychic journey, okay?
I think there's a connection between this place and the string of robberies in the heights.
how'd you know about the robberies?
I, uh, felt a burning when I sat down.
forget I asked.
please excuse my pseudo-colleague's presence. Now assuming...
that all four of our homeowners-- didn't just forget to turn on their systems,
I think a startek employee could've gotten those access codes to break in.
you remind me of one of my professors. Did you ever teach at Devry school of technology?
no.
well, I had one of these professors who often had harebrain theories like yours.
if we were really gonna rob any of the houses that we monitor, we would choose one in a totally higher income bracket.
take a look at this mansion, huh?
I would rob this bad boy so fast your head would spin.
really. How?
Lassiter, I don't- - O'hara, please.
what do you want, Shawn?
Gus, there's no way it can be these security guys.
I mean, they want to be cops, but they're really just on domestic detail.
Really?
like you'rea wanna be detective following a case we're not even on, when you should be finding chief vick a new nanny.
I trust you to head that up, Gus.
meanwhile, I'm going to borrow your car, check out those other houses that were robbed.
no way.
I will not have my echo be a part of your flagrant disobeying of the chief.
use your motorcycle.
dude, I can't do recon with that on suburban streets.
help me find the nanny, and then I'll take you.
Gus, I'm a grown man.
I don't have to depend on others to drive me around. Okay?
fine.
Ooh, slow down. Slow down.
what are we looking for again?
my kinkajou.
he's got to bearound here somewhere.
maybe he's more in the middle of the block.
your kinka-what?
kinkajou.
it's a 12-inch, monkey-like mammal.
it's become quite vogue to keep as a pet.
dermot Mulroney had one named baby love.
but I named minered hot monkey love.
all right, Shawn, cut the crap. I'm only doing this 'cause you agreed to mow the lawn.
it's time to fess up. What is really going on here?
all right, fine. There's been a string of robberies in the heights, and I need to get a closer look at one of the houses that got robbed.
why didn't you just say so?
because it's more fun to say kinkajou.
all right, which one?
that one.
yeah? Well, that's a stupid house to rob.
does anyone live up to your standards?
maybe we can get a hold of the burglar's number. You can call.
tell hi mhow disappointed you are.
Shawn, take a look at all the houses on this block.
of all of 'em, tell me why that one would be your last choice to break into?
I don't know, dad. I
Shawn. Now.
because all the other houses are easier targets than the one that actually got robbed.
neighbor two houses down has been gone for several days.
didn't bother to suspend their newspaper delivery.
good. What else?
the house on the other side is completely hidden by those trees and bushes.
it's the perfect vantage point for a burglar. Especially during the day time.
not to mention our house has a security system.
and bars on the windows.
this was not a crime of chance, Shawn.
that house was chosen for a reason.
there can only be one.
what?
what? I thought we were doing lines from highlander. My bad.
let's get out of here.
wait.
that sensational feeling.
that is the quickening.
everyone can do connery. Your lambert sucks.
at least I have a lambert.
Hey, Ada, it's Jaynie. They let me out early.
a nanny wouldn't be able to afford coach sunglasses, am I right?
well, she should be able to Nannies are criminally underpaid.
right. Because our children are our most precious resources.
no, because children are maddening hellions.
a great nanny can make all the difference in the world.
haven't you seen nanny 911?
no, I'm still trying to catch upon my dog whisperers.
nannies on there are brilliant.
I wish I had one of 'em when you were a kid.
uh, don't beat yourself up, pop.
sure, most of my good traits come from mom.
but you, uh...
no, that's really all I got.
okay, chief. Let me begin by saying no.
we have not found youa nanny yet.
but I have had a vision about nannies, ironically.
rings of nannies!
uh, rings of--of around my collar.
of thieves. Rings of thieves!
supplementing their paltry incomes as nannies.
rogue nannies robbing their bosses' Aykroyds and Belushis.
neighbors! Robbing their bosses' neighbors!
chief, if I can just get a little closer to these robberies
and--and--and we would still find you a nanny eventually.
Oh, Mr. Spencer. I'm sorry.
I must've fallen asleep.
that is so creepy. Your eyes were wide open.
Yeah. I learned to do that back when I was on stakeouts.
I have never been so sleep-deprived in my life.
but thank goodness you found me a nanny.
n-n-no. No, we haven't--we haven't done that yet.
then why are you here?
that's what I was saying.
I've got some very strong psychic rumblings about those robberies.
I gave you explicit instructions.
and you're here to tell me that you've completely disregarded everything I said?
no, no, no. Not completely.
well, look, if you're gonna put it like that, then sort of.
well. Let me put it just like this.
and listen very closely.
because I want you to get it clearly this time.
You...are...fired.
Yeah.
from which case?
all of them.
trying to solve that case is what got us in trouble in the first place, Shawn!
she said she wanted me to name the murderer.
as long as I could do it in ten seconds.
and as long as it didn't distract from the nanny search.
so you find the perfect nanny before she does.
I'll find the murderer for the police.
and voila, she's loving us again.
and exactly how is this plan different from what we were doing before?
because now we're renegades, dude.
it's so hardcore!
working without the chief's knowledge.
racing against a ticking clock for her approval.
it's gonna be so much more exciting.
can't you feel it?
no, Shawn. I don't feel it.
I feel depression.
I feel a series of missed payments on our rent.
that's the only thing that motivates me to think we needto fix this.
I need to get more informationon those two nannies from the park.
maybe get into that agency where they both work.
and how do you plan on doing that?
it's not like you can pretend you're a nanny.
the agency does doextensive security checks on who they hire.
but not necessarily on the parents who hire them.
come on, buddy. What do you say?
do a little cameo on my two dads?
that show was canceled for a reason, Shawn.
I'm sorry.
you're gonna have to find someone else to co-parent with.
I was gonna let you be Greg Evigan.
I just think that startek security is a dead end.
okay. All right. Fine.
what if I go investigate a different-- yes.
I know that you are lead detective, Lassiter.
Oh, going through a tunnel. Gotta go.
please let meeat my frustration in peace, Shawn.
there's this dark cloud surrounding you.
it's starving your chi. Yeah.
and down at the station, I can see a raccoon with dark circlesunder his eyes.
No--her eyes. Oh, god. It's the chief.
chief Vick is becoming Chief Coon.
and she's--she's lashing out at everyone.
that's true.
especially Lassie.
who in turn is taking his frustrations out on you.
look, Jules, you gotta take your chi back. Take it back.
and that means doing something big. Something risky.
something that'll help you blow this case wide open.
marry me, Juliet.
what are your opinionson ferberizing the baby?
Oh my god. Never. That's disgusting.
do you have any remedies for teething pains?
two valiums.
you would give the baby valium?
Oh, no. Of course not.
those are for me so I can deal with the crying.
I just give the baby half a valium.
look, Jules, you don't actually have to marry me, okay?
just--just pose as my wife when we go to the red balloon nanny agency.
I need to get a better psychic vibe on a couple of their nannies.
and you need a nanny why?
two particular nannies.
I think they're behindthe robberies in the heights.
so you're saying that this string of high-tech cat burglaries
one that ended in murder-- were caused by a couple of 19-year-old nannies?
don't be ridiculous. Only one of them is 19.
the other one's a slightly zaftig, polish nannyin her thirties.
Shawn, I can't help you do this.
Oh no, no, no. You wouldn't be helping me.
I would be helping you...
to solve the case the way you think it needs to be solved.
Jules, to get your chi back.
investigate these nannies with me.
otherwise your chi's going to shrivel up and starve to death.
you need to feed your chi.
besides, I wasn't going to say anything, but I had a vision of us being married.
I know it's probably this undercover thing we're gonna do, but it might have been a vision from our future.
Mr. And Mrs. Juliet Spencer. O'hara?
fine. I'll do it.
she said yes, everybody!
she loves me so much!
but only for detective work.
I don't buy into this whole husband and kids thing.
marriage is just a contractual obligation that the state mandated centuries ago when wives were considered property.
but if we are going to pretend...
this is what our wedding was like. It's sun set on a beach in Antigua...
so then I walk down the aisle to an a Cappella version of James Taylor's only one.
and by this time, the flower girls have tossed the peony petals into a soft, butterfly formation.
I'll take you in to see the head of the agency now.
Hi, I'm Abby Daniels.
and it says here that you are Mr. and Mrs. Levon Tostig.
that's correct.
why don't you tell me a little bit about your child.
well, we had little millicent in a home birth with a doula.
and afterwards, Levon here buried my placenta in the backyard.
some of our nannies are very environmentally conscious.
they're into homeopathicmethods.
great.
what kind of background checks do you run on these nannies?
well, I'm glad you asked that, because the safety of your children is something we pride ourselves on here at red balloon.
I like that very much.
well, why don't I show you a little bit around our offices.
and you can see some of the services that we offer here.
great.
so getting any psychic vibrations on your two suspects yet, Levon?
I think I got thrown off picturing your placenta.
now this is Steve Hitchcock.
he's in charge of the baby bonding cameras we install.
part of every nanny placement package.
what are babybonding cameras?
well, they're a series of web cams we set up in your home.
you can log on any time during the day and see how your child and the nanny are doing.
so you're spying on them.
Oh, no. Not at all.
the nannies are aware these cameras are installed.
it's more to keep in touch with your child.
not to mention having the nanny know you may be watching her at any time, it encourages her to be extra responsible.
you're the only ones with the access to the camera feed.
you sign onto the web site using a unique password only you know.
so you can see, not only do we run extensive background checks on our nannies, you can check on them whenever you like.
Ooh, uh, sweetie, why don't you tell them how we decorated little Millie's room, then they'll know how to set up the cameras. Excuse me.
well, we decorated with a raspberry and sage theme.
and then we did this pinstripe wallpaper that really accented the sea foam green that we had done in the crown molding.
perfect timing, Gus.
a nanny wouldn't be able to afford coach sunglasses, am I right?
of course, I love what Nate Berkus did on Oprah's nursery theme week.
so I took his idea and I did the long, flowing curtains.
but only on twoof the windows, even though there's four
hon, we should probably get going.
great!
well, if you have any other questions, you just let us know.
thank you. I will.
or e-mail.
e-mail is good too.
O'hara.
where?
okay, I'll be right there.
that was Lassiter.
wants me to meet him at some exotic reptile shop on central.
said they found some of the stolen merchandise from the robberies.
can I come? I'd love to see what my wife does at work all day.
and then before every nap time, we read good night moon and the giving tree.
those are my favorite books.
and then she lies downfor a 45-minute nap, which I keep track of in my client sleep chart.
I love charts. When can you start?
all right, when'd the items come in?
jeez Louise.
does it look likeI keep records in quicken in here?
maybe Tuesday.
can you at least describe the person who sold them to you?
you get used to lookin' at lizards all day, people all start to look alike.
was it a man or a woman?
boy, you ask some toughies.
I think it was a guy.
pasty white guy? Beatnik haircut. Stupid grin?
I don't think so.
was he roly-poly like a puffer fish?
Spencer, what the hell?
Yeah. Yeah, he was.
now I'm seeing red. Was he red-faced like a koi fish?
exactly.
and did he spit a lot like a komodo dragon?
just like a komodo. - Great!
I'll take this description down to our sketch artist at the aquarium.
all right, tell me exactly which items this fish man sold.
your vision kinda sounds like that red-faced guy from the red balloon nanny agency--Steve.
I was thinking the kool-aid guy. But yours probably makes more sense.
Yeah. I'm going to head back down to the station, investigate them a little more.
see if I can get a warrant.
so it's not the nannies that are responsible for the burglaries.
it's the agency. - Yeah.
Gus, I'm so glad you called.
you're about to be a lot gladder.
chief vick has officially forgiven us.
I just found her a nanny.
Oh, that's perfect.
I think I just figured out who the bad guys are.
the best part is, she can start right away.
her security check is already done, because she works for the best agency in town.
Oh, no.
please don't say the...
red balloon nanny agency.
this is the part I hate. Waiting for warrants.
Oh, we're not waiting for warrants.
can you please tell me what we're doing here?
look, Gus, we know the everything of the crime.
we know the who, we know the where.
we're pretty solid on the where of.
we're pretty sure of the where to for.
we're scratch on the what chamacallit - Shawn.
cause that's self-explanatory. - Shawn.
we don't have the how.
why do we need to know the how if the guy's gonna bearrested?
dude, I'm the one that has to do the wrap-up, remember?
you want me to get up there with eggs benedic tall over my face?
the Canadian bacon in my hair? Hollandaise dripping down?
I need zing. I'm a psychic. I gotta see everything.
come on.
Oh, hi, Levon. What are you doing here?
this is Shmuel Coen.
he's my best friend and god father to my little Millicent.
now he's, uh, very overprotective and he insisted on coming by and getting a feel for the folks that are going to be caring for his little god daughter.
Oh, well, guys, I'm so sorry.
but Steve and Abby, they're out doing home interviews with clients.
you know what, we're okay with waiting.
dude, she has a headache.
start whistling something by Philip glass.
okay, you know what, guys?
you don't have to wait out here.
you know, I betyou'd be more comfy in Mrs. Daniel's office.
you sure it's no trouble?
no, no. Not at all. You know where it is, right?
thank you.
what kind of clues are we looking for?
any kind.
somebody chews tobacco.
how about some new clues?
what are you doing?
dude, I think this thing opens up.
scratches on both sides of the wall.
it's, like, a secret door or something.
nicely done, Gus.
these are feeds from the baby bonding cameras that the agency installs.
it's kind of creepy.
Yeah, especially since the only ones that are supposed to be able to access these feeds are the parents themselves.
this is our proof, Shawn.
they watch the footage from the cameras, get the security codes, see where people are hiding their valuables, and case out their houses.
we got it, Shawn. Let's go.
what?
no, that doesn't make any sense.
none of the houses that got robbed had nannies working in them.
dude, it wasn't the houses with the nannies. It was the houses next door.
Juliet's gonna have a hard time serving the warrant here at the red balloon, when the person she's trying to arrest is sitting in Chief Vick'sliving room!
sweet black licorice. I've got the how.
I've got to get Juleson the phone right away.
time is of the essence here!
Jules, it's Shawn.
first of all, how are you?
Oh, that sounds nice.
secondly, meet meat Chief Vick's house pronto.
I've had a big vision. Top seven of all time. Let's go.
thanks for getting here so quickly, guys.
Where's your baby gift?
a what?
the baby gift.
lassie, we're about to enter the chief's home.
you can't just barge in, guns a blazing. This is delicate.
the suspect could be holding Chief Vick's baby.
or we could make Chief Vick very, very angry. You don't want that.
nobody wants that.
probably should've given you this sooner, but, uh, happy baby gift.
uh, thank you.
it's a mini rattle and also a low calorie breath freshener.
Oh, great. Is there anything I can do for you guys?
we just wanted to say hi.
Oh, okay.
Oh, uh, Shawn, I'm glad that you're here.
I just wanted to apologize for snapping at you the other day.
chief, there's no need. Really.
Oh, well, you know, I was just so mad, I just wanted to strangle you.
but I admit I was wrong.
I realized I was overreacting after I tried to run my husband over after he left the garage door open.
but this agency that you and gus found...
Yeah, about- - Mrs. Vick!
Yeah.
I just finished up installing the cameras.
guess who just fell asleep?
iris is sleeping?
like a lamb.
please tell me that your other nannies are as good with childrenas you are.
even better.
you guys did a great job.
Yeah. About that...
Mr. and Mrs. Tostig I didn't realize you knew Mrs. Vick.
Mr. Softy would like to say a few words.
Oh, Shawn, I really don't think that this is the time.
I thought his name was Levon.
what's that?
the bear snores really loud, he's pretty sure the turtle's really an alien, and all the monkey wants to do is play pull my finger.
Oh and somebody just put in some video cameras?
Yeah, I just set up a bunch of them. So?
well, they're not normal video cameras.
they're all high-techy with army-grade resolution.
what? What's that, fella? Look up?
that's just a fan, silly.
lassie, what's that?
this is the extella 5400.
they're the baby bonding cameras, so you can check in.
the extella 5400 retails for over $10, 000.
I'm fine.
I'm seeing angles and pivots and divots.
well, no divots. But it sure is fun to say those back-to-back.
pivots and divots and pivots and divots and pivots and divots and- - shn.
who wants to give that a shot?
give what a shot shots. That's it. Exactly.
but I don't see any shots of nannies playing with babies.
in fact, there's no babies at all.
I'm seeing jewelry boxes and safes and entrances and exits and security keypads.
but--but from where?
from the houses next door.
what are you talking about?
there's a baby sleeping.
I'm talking about
Shawn, will you stop!
well, it's like a mine field!
I'm talking about casing out houses next door to the ones your nannies work at.
I'm talking about a string of robberies, one of which went terribly wrong, when all of a sudden your witness-less crime got witnessed.
and then it became murder.
that ridiculous.
is it as ridiculous as having a secret panel in your office where you can plan all your robberies?
you had access to each and every one of those baby bonding cameras, and you manipulated them.
not to check on any nannies, but to case the houses next door to capture security alarm codes so you could break into those houses undetected.
I'd say that's pretty ridiculous.
though not as ridiculous as Denise Richards playing a nuclear physicist named Christmas Jonesin a bond movie.
but still.
look, I don't know what this guy's deal is, but we gotta go.
this guy's deal is that he's a psychic.
who happens to work for the police.
Oh, really?
Yeah, really.
the Santa Barbara police department, which I'm the chief of.
anybody ever tell you you look like a puffer fish?
sorry.
I can't believe it all worked out.
I know.
all I had to do was get the fruit bowl assortment from garrett bell'sjellybean factory and every flavor'sdelicious.
I'm talking about with Chief Vick.
her nephew's transferring to a nursing school in Santa Barbara.
in two weeks, she'll have her old nanny back.
mm, pomegranate.
I wonder what she's going to do in the meantime.
Oh, I took care of that.
you mean, after I scoured the city and couldn't find anyone, you just stumbled upon a nanny responsible enough for Chief Vick?
that I did.
give me a little whoop.
and you gotta admit-- the man knows how to work a baby.
don't look back. Just keep walking.
Shawn! Shawn! Where are you going?
come on, you said five minutes! Don't you dare leave!
I'm smelling something really foul coming out of this thing!
what the hell is going on here?
uh, nothing.
my mistake.
sorry, guys.
that's okay.
see you later, dad.
okay, Shawn...out with it.
we're starting a secret club.
the "burn down the house" club?
the Gus and Shawn club.
it's actually the Shawn and Gus club.
you know, a club needs regulations, by laws.
you guys got any rules?
yes: No girls.
and everybody has to be under 12.
no old guys.
and they have to have a love of correct grammar.
that's not a rule!
you said we could have one special rule--that's mine.
and that's the best rule you could think of?
I think you mean that's the best rule of which you could think.
I'm not being in a club with this.
fine, I don't need you and your misplaced prepositions.
wanna be in a club?
present days ah, dude, I feel like the weight of the world is off my shoulders.
one phone call, and my mountain man trip with my dad is off.
why'd he back out?
he was sick.
he sounded horrible.
he was lurching, he was coughing.
he even sounded pale.
how do you sound pale?
I don't know. Maybe he didn't sound pale, but he definitely sounded feverish.
maybe he's driving himself to the hospital.
you know what this means.
what? What? -We gotta go.
there's no time to discuss.
Oh, Gus, uh...
pay.
I still don't see why you're so uptight.
30 seconds ago you were thrilled your dad bailed on you.
that's when I thought he was dying.
dude, do you realize where we are right now?
that's the monarch lodge.
your dad's a member?
are you kidding me?
we're going in.
you can't just walk into the Monarch Lodge.
they're a clandestine society.
they have a secret handshake.
fold it, fold it, skim it.
crouching tiger, zookeeper's boy, hairdresser on fire, girlfriend in a coma.
slap it on a biscuit.
Oh, you might not want to do that.
doctor guster just inseminated an appaloosa.
all the way up to the elbow.
no time to wash up.
thank you.
you're a good man.
I've always wanted to see the inside of this place.
he started the Santa Barbara Mirror.
dude...
Moby's a monarch.
that's not moby, Shawn.
the city's first postmaster.
can you believe this?
I'm pretty sure that's chuck from the Wonder Years.
dude.
Oh, my god.
that is really disturbing.
Ah, jeez, what are you doing?
come on, Ted, dragging me all the way over here for this!
dad, you owe me an explanation...
what the hell are you into?
you need to call the police.
we did.
a policeman and a brother.
Ted, I'm retired from both.
S.B.P.D.
here, I'll dial for you.
let's go.
this is unbelievable.
practically every doctor in the city is a member here.
do you realize what this means?
Yes, it means my dad, Mr. Integrity, is nothing more than a lying liar from liarsburg.
that's Dr. Downs.
he has a huge practice on the mesa, and he just dumped his rep.
I've been trying to get in there for years.
I'll be right back.
don't step on the corpse head.
how'd you get in here?
I think I should ask you the same thing...
sick faker!
let me feel your forehead.
what are you doing, following me around?
I don't have time for this, Shawn.
take a look, there's a dead body in the room.
yes-- Mr. Arthur Holmstrom.
he was murdered.
three creams, four sugars.
thank you.
Oh, and here's this.
what's this? -Yours didn't cost anything.
dropped my name, huh?
no, coffee club.
buy 15 coffees, you get one free.
you should get one.
gee, I don't know.
I mean, what am I gonna do wi let me give you a little lesson, O'hara
we have 1144.
deceased male, 1385 Granada place.
detectives Lassiter and O'hara en route.
you know that's littering.
back up, what do you mean "murdered"?
maybe poisoned.
I'm not sure yet.
Shawn, this is not the place for one of your reckless assumptions.
dad, take a look around.
these guys hardly seem broken up by this.
I've known Arthur Holmstrom since the day he joined this lodge.
he was not the most likable guy.
fine. Whatever.
I have more important issues to deal with.
I want the truth.
what really happened to my cat, chairman meow?
you want answers?
I want the truth.
you can't handle the truth!
you drive me a little crazy, Shawn.
the idea of spending an entire weekend with you...
I drive you crazy?
and your cat?
got a little too familiar with the armrest of my sofa.
there.
Henry, I am really sorry for pulling you in on such short notice.
it's just we were all really nervous about this.
I mean, what if we did something wrong?
he had that hood on for 20 minutes.
what if he suffocated?
Ted, calm down.
it's a cloth hood.
you've performed this ceremony, what, a dozen times?
I know, I know.
it's just that we want to make sure it's handled right.
you talked to the police, right?
Yes, yes. Thank you, thank you.
say, is this your son?
you know how we love a legacy around here.
no, no, no.
no, yes, he is my son, technically, but I...
Ted, I'm getting...
no, no, no, you don't. Not here, Shawn.
this is not the time for your shenanigans.
it was a single shenanigan.
technically more of a hijink.
pet killer!
I'm not a pet killer, Shawn.
chairman meow is living very happily in a retirement home in Ojai.
and I don't want to burst your bubble, but chairman meowis chairwoman meow.
no.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
what the hell are you doing here?
lassie, as it happens, my father is a member here.
that's impossible.
benevolent lodge rule ab4567 bars any law enforcement memberf rom being a member.
Yeah, and that rule is bogus.
we made that up to keep out undesirables.
Undesirables"?
people who aren't lodge material.
or anyone who's been married to my daughter.
and you are?
this is Irving Parker.
he's my father-in-law, excuse me.
soon to be former father-in-law.
not so fast.
victoria and I have had severalcivil conversations lately.
give it up, Carlton!
it was a lost cause two years ago, and it's a lost cause now.
get over it. She has. Move on!
I think we'll all be better off for it.
can I talk to you for a second?
are you sure you want to be on this case?
you have a personal involvement here.
that's right, O'hara, this is personal.
and if it does turn out to be something, that's exactly why I need to be on it.
but these people have something against you.
well, they won't anymore after I solve it.
look, you don't understand, O'hara.
I need to be the hero.
I need to solve this case quickly, and look brilliant in the process, and you need to help me do that.
please.
it's been a pleasure talking with you, Dr. Downs.
well, you make quitean impression, Mr. Guster.
and under the circumstances, that's saying something.
well, thank you very much.
and once again, I want to express my sincere condolences.
perhaps you could give my office a call, and we could set aside some time.
how about Monday?
terrific.
great.
we're done here.
Thanks.
and another thing, dad.
just when, exactly, were you a member here?
it was a long time ago, Shawn.
I'm not a part of this place anymore.
and whether or not this was murder, you are hereby ordered to steer clear.
these guys are not to be messed with.
I cannot possibly be more serious about this.
tuesday at 11: 00 is perfect.
I'll be there with bells on.
okay.
dude, who says that?
closers.
closers say that.
well, if by closers you mean middle-aged women, then, yes, I do believe I've heard the phrase.
are you forgetting that we many have stumbled upon a murder today?
a murder that you're takingentirely too unseriously?
the man's name was Arthur Holmstrom, and he died during the sacred star ceremony.
get over here, look at this.
it's weird.
weird?
those guys look down right evil.
white men in hoods?
dude, they're violet.
that's how it starts, Shawn.
do you see that?
holy crap, Shawn.
your dad was right.
it's one of those scary lodge guys.
they're here for us.
they know you think they killed that guy.
what are you doing here?
I think you know why I'm here.
well, hopefully you're here to help.
Gus and I were about to do some scrapbooking.
we'll need someone who can work the scalloped scissors.
Spencer, I get why you have to act like an ass at my station, but do you have to act like this in your own office?
it enhances my perception.
how else would I know that you came here because you think Arthur Holmstrom was murdered?
no one's talking down at the lodge.
I was just driving by the office and saw the lights on.
you want to hire us.
Oh, come on, Lassie, it's not that tough.
let it go.
lass, come on. -Look around --you're in a safe place.
surrounded by men who love you.
Lassiter, I love you.
look...
you have a connection in there.
so I need you to feel around and see what you can find out.
the department's hiring us?
uh, not the department, me.
and I can't pay you.
well, that sounds worthwhile.
I guess this would technicallybe called a favor.
maybe I could pay your expenses.
done!
15 grand a day.
when we're finished, we all go for a picnic.
this is a discreet investigation.
I'd like to show you something.
see this?
it's the lodge radar.
and look at this.
it's me flying underneath it.
now look down here.
it's Gus.
he can't fly.
it is imperative that you keep a low profile.
place the robeon our new brother.
that's it, huh?
I'm official?
no brimstone?
I don't have to crab walk or get tickled with a feather?
come on, somebody, tickle mewith a feather--you.
gentlemen, to the bar.
Yes.
save me a shot.
don't you think it's odd that it's just business as usual when someone died here the other day?
definitely.
it appears as though he's been all but forgotten. Look.
Holmstrom's already been moved.
those paintings are in order of rank.
once the highmost patriarch moves on, he's replaced by the next guy in line.
that's Irving Parker.
right.
Holmstrom was fifth in line.
somehow he leapfrogged three other guys, including Parker and two of your doctor buddies.
25 "g"s for "computers for kids"?
30 "g"s for "toys for kids."
15 grand for "clothing for kids"?
these guys are ultra-philanthropists.
they're the most charitable organization in the city.
why would they commit murder?
well, maybe it was for the kids.
the shroud of Charlemagne.
dude, Holmstrom was wearing this hood the day he died.
check it out, it's 100 years old.
like a lot of the guys around this place.
sorry.
what?
nothing.
thank you.
you know my newest clients, Dr. Masood Nigam, and Dr. Roger Downs.
Yes, yes, I do.
congratulations on your clientship.
Oh, just-- you're in good hands with Gus.
nimble, agile hands.
surgeon's hands, really.
he once removed a boil from his own thigh using a paper clipand a warm can of sprite.
dude, when did you have time to make all these sales?
we were in there for an hour.
an hour is all you need, Shawn, when you've got sales reptitude.
Dr. Mccormerly, can I talk to you for a second?
you're calling me a day after our first date?
you really are out of practice.
so what'd you find out?
well, it appears our victim made top dog with very little effort.
one day he was fifth in line for the job, the next day he was highmost patriarch.
Oh, and the next day he was dead.
does anyone suspect you?
members?
Oh, sweet justice!
they made you a member?
now, don't get all mad, Lassie.
there was a 15-minute waiting period.
I finally learned the lyrics to informer while they convened and agreed on me.
let me give you my card, Dr. Mccormerly, 'cause you do not want to miss out on this baby.
are you staking me out?
no.
Yes, you are.
no, I'm not.
I can sense you're right around the corner.
whoa, you're breaking up.
can you call me back, Lassie?
I don't have time for this.
I've got another call.
O'hara, finally.
where are you?
I'm at lunch.
Ooh, get me a turkey and avocado.
let me talk to her.
hands off!
is someone there with you?
Hi, Jules.
Spencer.
you're having lunch with Shawn?
maybe.
is something going on?
well, actually, they're just strange.
strange how?
Oh, come on.
well, it doesn't look like natural causes, and his blood had trace elements of...
I don't even want to say.
come on, O'hara.
well, it had what looks like the toxin similar to the venom of a Brazilian vine snake.
you've gotta be kidding me.
he got bit by a snake?
am I on speakerphone?
no.
well, then, how did he hear?
Jules, how 'bout you just tell us, huh?
well, he didn't have a mark on him.
there weren't any puncture wounds.
the only thing he had was a little skin irritation on his face.
obviously these results are inconclusive, so run the tests again because we need results that aren't ridiculous.
I don't know, Lassie, I kinda like this snake idea.
why are you sharing information with Shawn on a case we haven't hired him for?
uh, you know what, o'hara, [Broken speech]You--breaking--uhh.
I call you back.
nice.
you joined the lodge?
what can I do, dad?
I'm a legacy.
it's in our blood.
damn it, Shawn, I'm not kidding.
you've gotta reconsider this.
you get a lot of powerful people into one room, and dangerous things happen.
would you please let the police just do their job?
I am working for the police.
sort of.
it's a discreet investigation.
Yeah, discreet--that's one of your talents.
I'm working on a theory.
Arthur Holmstrom was poisoned with snake venom.
snake venom.
the Brazilian vine snake.
specific to remote river basinsin northern brazil.
about two to three feet in length.
so someone snuck a three-foot snake into the lodge and killed him during the ceremony?
the perfect crime.
right.
except there were no marks left on the body.
Oh, so we're looking for an invisible snake.
you know, Shawn, that's it.
right--right there.
that is your problem.
maybe you'd be better off looking for something that you can see.
there is a pecking order right in front of your eyes.
Oh, dad, you're gonna ruin my diagram!
Yep, who's at the top, huh?
who's the next guy in line?
I know where the top is, you could have just pointed.
now there's coke all over everything.
forget it.
just grow up.
me grow up.
a grown man makes a crawly snake.
this is Parker's place.
I can see the sign, Shawn.
well, I bet they'revery busy inside.
might I suggest coming back this evening and breaking in?
good idea.
let me see what I'm doing for the next three to five years, with time offfor good behavior.
we're here now.
I can get us in.
all of a sudden you can just "get us in"?
Shawn, I'm totally in a sales zone this week.
you leave this secret handshake to me.
I'm not showingan appointment, mister...
and this is my associate William Zane.
I'm an old friend, and I'm just paying Mr.Parker a birthday visit.
it's not his birthday.
I know, it's mine.
we're here on lodge business.
that's a three right there.
what?
nothing better to do on your birthday?
well, it's my 29th, not one of the important ones.
you'll understand when you get to be my age.
I'll only be a minute.
I'll just let him know that you're here.
no, no need, Doris.
it's my birthday.
surprise!
you still need a seven right there.
it's your birthday?
that's your sales reptitude?
it comes in all flavors, Shawn.
is suck a flavor?
dude!
the world's very first crock-pot.
what the hell are you guys doing here?
Mr. Parker, it's me, Shawn Spencer.
I'm the newest monarch, remember?
Yeah, I remember.
so what the hell are you guys doing wandering around my warehouse?
this is my very good friend Gus.
he's looking to jointhe monarch lodge too.
I thought maybe you could make that happen.
you know, haze him a little bit.
soak his hand in warm waterwhile he's sleeping, that sort of thing.
do you have any sheep here?
this is not a lodge.
this is my place of business.
and the fact that you slid into membership on the coattails of your turncoat dad, that doesn't guarantee any favors from me.
now I'm through talking to you nicely.
I want you to turn around and get the hell outof here.
right now!
I'm surprised he didn't say "good day."
what's that?
I said good day.
dude, did you see those shipping crates?
those are airport codes, all Brazilian.
brazilian airport codes?
how do you know that?
I lived in an airport for a month, Gus.
that was Tom Hanks in the Terminal.
same difference.
we need to talk to Lassiter.
no, you need to talk to Lassiter.
I'll drop you off.
where are you going?
I have appointments with four new clients.
and product doesn't sell itself.
man...
anything?
well, I've got good news, and I've got bad news.
the good news is we found a pretty solid suspect on the Holmstrom murder.
finally.
well, who is it? Let's go get him.
that's the bad news.
that is ridiculous!
who's in charge here, huh?
I'll tell you this, I better be home for dinner!
heads are gonna roll, that's all I got to say!
heads are gonna roll!
Oh, no.
do not go down that road.
look, I'm not happy about this either, Lassie.
now that I've joined the lodge, that makes your father-in-law my brother.
which makes meyour uncle in-law.
it's gonna get especially awkward around the holidays.
Spencer, you can't seriously suspect Parker.
unfortunately, it sort of checks out.
if it was venom that killed Holmstrom, it came from a snake that only slithers in a region where Parker does half his business.
he's in room "A.
who's going to question him?
I will.
Carlton, do you really think this is a good idea?
you're related.
it's against department policy.
O'hara, quiet.
I'm gonna handle it.
I can't believe this is happening.
Lassiter's desk.
it's your wife.
I mean your ex-wife.
Hey!
Yeah, well, it seems that Irving is kind of a, um-- well, he's a murder suspect.
Yes.
no, this is not because I want the barbecue.
I already gave you the golf clubs.
so how'd he go?
not quietly.
you ever meet his wife?
no, and if she's anything like her dad, I don't want to.
Okeydoke.
that seems fair.
O'hara, please go down to the room.
I'll be down in a minute.
Spencer, I want you to listen to me, and listen closely.
I know Irving Parker very well, and he wouldn'tkill anyone.
sure, he might hobble their spirit and crush their soul and dancein the flaming ashes of their broken marriage, which he had a partin ending.
but he wouldn't kill anyone.
look...
he's the only suspect we have.
he tried to hate me to death.
I know it's circumstantial, but in a pretty bad way.
I know, and I'm going to go treat him just as I would any other suspect.
but I think Holmstrom's murderer is still out there.
just--just workshop it.
do whatever it is you do, because at the end of the day, it absolutely cannot be him.
workshop it"?
I don't know if reverse engineering the case was such a good idea.
did its" won 12-zip.
but Lassiter said he was sure that Parker's not our guy.
well, the board seems to disagree vehemently.
fine, then let's move away from him, and check out the other lodge members.
what do we know about Holmstrom?
we know he's dead.
that's a good start.
I'm serious, Shawn.
I was in that lodge making contacts.
I know.
you have sales reptitude.
now can we please retire that expression?
throw it a party, put it on medicare, it's just not working anymore.
no, Shawn, what I'm saying is those other lodge members were hardly overwhelmed with grief.
even as Holmstrom lay on the floor,
I was shamelessly moving my product, and no one seemed to think anything of it.
I'd say Holmstrom had some enemies.
well, we gotta figure out who they are.
and how do we do that?
Ooh, there's something much more important we have to do first.
Tobias, I've heard the canvas adds ten pounds.
is that accurate?
maybe you could paint some angry tigers or a puma laying prostrateat my feet.
this is a portrait of your head.
I thought we were here to find something about Holmstrom.
we are. This is for posterity.
don't worry, you're next.
he doesn't get one.
he's not a member yet.
maybe we could paint him in the background of mine.
put his head in the puma's mouth.
you're going to ignore that.
Hey, uh, why did they take Arthur Holmstrom's painting down so quickly?
all of his things were taken over to his house.
do it lightly.
[Bickering in whispers] Say what you will about credit cards and paper clips, sometimes a door just needs to be owned.
that's a screwdriver, shawn.
screwdrivers too.
I think it was unlocked.
it was not unlocked.
I think it was.
the door was most definitely not unlocked.
Gus, the man was a widower, nobody's here.
why don't you let me use my new contacts to get the information?
is that how we do things, Gus, really?
why talk to someone about Holmstrom when we could have his home office tell us everything we need to know?
his hopes, his dreams, his love for the ladies.
I think that's his wife.
people lie, stuff doesn't.
did you lock the front door?
Yes, I locked the door.
I don't think it was locked.
I know I lock...
you see that?
they had to break a window.
burn!
no.
I just tried that.
well, I did it in a different spot, Shawn!
he's coming, he's coming, coming, coming!
watch out!
people breaking into offices-- no one respects anything anymore.
you shh.
my god, did you see who that was?
it's hard to see anything with someone's knee in your eye.
it's your own knee.
get out of here!
look at this place.
whoever was here wasn't invited either.
a secret safe.
dude, you gotta get us in there.
I can't get us in that safe, Shawn.
that's a Martin 16.
you're 36 monthsinto a subscription to modern safecrackermagazine-- what's the point?
I'm an amateur, Shawn.
well, it's time to go pro, fingers.
fingers?
twist it up.
watch out.
would you stop it!
now I've gotta start all over.
this month would be good.
it's not happening, Shawn.
try 36-24-36.
are you serious?
just click it in gentle.
that was a good idea.
now what?
I really thought I nailed that.
Shawn, you've really gotta work on your estimating skills.
dude.
you're a safe-cracking machine!
I know.
grab that.
all right, I've got $25, 000 for computers for kids.
this one says 35, 000.
one of these books is a fraud.
dude, Holmstrom was skimming funds from the lodge.
and look, he's writing in some secret, ancient code.
no, this isn't code. They're abbreviations.
Hx" means history,"qd" means every day,"c" means and.
deposit history, "follow up with accounts every day, transfer and withdrawals."
you're telling me you can read this?
of course I can.
this is doctor's shorthand.
and this is doctor's handwriting.
see these sticky notes?
Holmstrom wrote these.
he wasn't skimming, he figured out who was.
one of the doctors is cooking the books.
how sure are you?
we've gone on much less.
look, Irving, it's been four hours.
is that all?
you know, Carlton, it may be the rage talking, but if I had it to do over again, the day my Tory came home with you,
I would have told her to go right back out that door and come back alone.
that's what I should have done.
all right, Irving, that's enough!
now, I loved Victoria, and because she loved you,
I let it slide that you're a pain in the ass.
but you're at my table now, and around here, we call someone like you a hostile witness.
it's a good way to get yourself locked up.
I can make your life a living hell, so you better give me the respect I deserve.
and I suggest you cut the crap.
clear?
I want a straight answer, and I want it immediately.
how did Arthur Holmstrom advance to the highmost patriarch when you were the next in line?
well, I don't know how Art convinced the other guys.
he asked me, and I said it was okay.
he was a friend of mine, and he had health problems.
he was getting worse.
and I gave him the only chance he'd probably ever get.
now, as forthe snake business, I haven't traveled abroadin over three years.
I haven't been out of the country since you got married.
doctor's orders.
are we done?
we're done when I saywe're done!
we're done.
you can go.
we've been to four doctors' offices.
none of the handwriting matches the books.
Plus, I probably caught something from somebody, and I'm tired of reading highlights for children.
they always hide the apple in the bike.
can you man up, Shawn?
is that possible?
I'm on an unbelievable hot streak right now, and I'm not about to ruin it.
well, it's good to know that moving oozing infection gel is more important than finding a killer.
Hey, maybe we could park on a steeper incline next time.
my quads aren't burning enough.
tell heather to call back tomorrow.
yes?
good afternoon.
I'm Burton Guster, with central coast pharmaceuticals.
we're closed.
Yes, well, I'm here to drop off some product to Dr. Downs.
he's a brother of mine.
he isn't here at.
well, he was expecting me.
you can leave your card.
I just thought I'd drop by and pay him a birthday visit.
it's my birthday, the big two-nine.
remember that one?
I'm 26.
Really?
uh, so...
will Dr. Downs be here later?
I will make sure he gets this.
and look, he's writing in some secret, ancient code.
dude!
I just solved it.
call Lassie.
right.
13850 Granada.
to absent friends.
to absent friends.
absent friends?
like Arthur Holmstrom?
what?
my sweet violet brothers, we congregate here today in the flesh, not only to recognize our new highmost patriarch, Irv Parker, but also to bear witness.
along with the magic head of Gus, the wisdom of Baum...
and that...
that stuffed creature.
Arthur Holmstrom was murdered.
duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck...
goose!
Dr. Roger Downs, entrusted with the proceeds of charity activities, was funneling funds into his own pocket and covering his tracks by using a dummy accounting ledger.
now, when Holmstrom discovered the corruption, he confronted Downs and made a play for the highmost patriarch position.
in exchange for his silence, Holmstrom got what he wanted.
but Downs still couldn't chance getting caught.
and so he killed his own lodge brother right here on the eye of Hathor in the middle of the lodge.
and this is the murder weapon.
how dare you accuse me?
I am a respected officer of this lodge.
by the shores of Gitchagoomee, I can see you in the house, frantically searching for the ledgers that Holmstrom kept securely stored in his safe, I ronically, to keep you good to your word.
Arthur Holmstrom's death was, um, unfortunate, but I had nothing to do with it.
check it out, Lassie.
I'm quite certain you'll find traces of a powdered form of the venom of the Brazilian vine snake, native to Brazil.
it's part of an antivenom that Dr. Downs uses in his charitable work abroad.
who knew that in small doses it acts as a vaccine, while larger dosesare absolutely lethal?
I did...
Really?
this is absurd!
Holmstrom died of natural causes.
by the halls of Montezuma, I see you taking great care to put on protective gloves while lining the inside of the hood with the powder for Holmstrom's patriarch ceremony, making it deadly venomous.
the poor old man's head and face never stood a chance.
not too keen on the hippocratic oath, are we, Rog?
I have nothing to say.
speak to my lawyer.
hold it right there, Dr. Downs.
you're under arrest.
and none of this, your highmost, would have been discovered without the intrepid police work of one detective Carlton Lassiter, Santa Barbara police department's own highmost patriarch.
nice collar, detective.
it's all in a day's work, irving.
you may t be my son-in-law much longer, but I'm thinking you might be a monarch yet.
Hey!
you ready to go?
what could you possibly mean by that?
our big weekend, remember?
I cancelled, I felt bad.
so I just thought we'd go this weekend.
Ooh, dad, wow...
I wish you'd given me a little bit of advance notice.
I'm--I'm swamped here.
Yeah, right.
all right, look, I'm gonna go.
you want to come along, you're welcome.
whoa, dad, wait a second.
there's still something that doesn't make any sense to me.
why did you leavethe lodge?
look, shawn, it's not important, let it go.
Oh, come on, you big liar.
throw a little truth on the barbie, see if it stinks.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about man candor.
let's have some.
all right, all right, you want some man candor.
you want the truth?
my marriage was falling apart, and I made a choice.
I stopped caring about the lodge, because I realized the only real membership that mattered was family.
there.
family?
[Strained chuckle] You really expect me to believe that?
[Tapping on wall] What the hell is that?
Oh, this you gotta see.
nice addition, don't you think?
we grabbed 'em on our way out of the lodge.
way out?
Yeah, Gus and I decided we didn't want to belong to a club that would have Lassiter as a member.
you can have yours if you want it.
Nah.
no, I think it should stay right where it is.
that way I can always keep an eye on you.
what is happening to you, Shawn?
only the worst thing ever!
a missing captain delicious magic mood ring!
dad, this is a crime.
can you have them arrested?
first of all, Shawn no, this is not a crime.
can't you just haul them in for questioning? Lay into them a little?
and who is "them"?
you know, the cereal people?
Oh, the cereal people, huh?
I'll tell you what, Shawn.
you can spend a lot of time calling 411 to get the number for your cereal people.
they're going to stick you on hold forever, listening to bad music, finally you're going to get some dim-witted secretary who's going to take your message, and then she's going to throw it in a waste bucket.
or you can use the skills I taught you, and you can outsmart them.
what am I missing?
where is the ring?
well, it'd be at the bottom...
not of this box. You're right.
the big old bad cereal company messed up.
so you grab another box. Tough luck.
Where's the ring now?
at the bottom.
now I've got to eat the whole box.
and where's the ring now?
at the top!
that's right. You see, sometimes Shawn, you don't have to dig so deep.
all you've got to do is turn something upside down to make it right-side up, and then...
you get your prize.
Thanks, dad!
explain to me again why we couldn't sit in a restaurant and eat like civilized people.
moving is good, Gus. It helps the digestion.
Plus, you and I never do this anymore.
what, eat and jog?
no, talk. Just talk.
check in with each other as men.
I want to know how you are.
I want to know how Gus is.
Really? Like you're really asking me?
Yes, I'm really asking, because I care.
Wow. Okay.
we've been working cases nonstop for a month.
to be honest, I'm burnt.
I just want to take a nap.
I couldn't agree with you more, buddy I think we should lay low for a bit.
no more cases. - Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that.
I was kind of worried about telling you.
don't be a silly goose.
now, we've had a good talk I think we both felt it and look at this. Here we are.
what is this, Shawn?
okay, here's the thing.
the police may have found a body which I may have picked up on my police scanner which I may have brought with me.
no cases, Shawn. - No cases.
we go in, we see we say hello, and we leave.
say hello?
this is a crime scene. You can't just walk in there.
buzz? Seriously?
don't you ever talk to him?
why would I talk to anybody named Buzz?
Shawn! My man!
okay with...yes.
you look trim.
somebody made their wedding weight.
five more pounds. I'm close.
but I still have a month.
you'll get there. You remember my partner?
sure, yeah...Matt, right?
right.
so, what have you got going on up there? Don't hold out on me, now.
looks like suicide. The guy from the phone company found the victim in his apartment.
been up there for a few days already.
a few days?
you mind if we head up take a look, poke around a little?
Aw, I don't know Lassiter's up there, and he's in a mood.
Yeah, we just...we got his coffee.
want to bring it by, make it right.
Oh, that's nice of you. He asked me to get it, but...
but this is perfect.
Hey, did you just sip that?
you don't taste Lassiter's coffee before you give it to him?
that surprises me, Buzz. He's so particular with no cream, no sugar...
it's three creams, four sugars.
Yeah, it is.
sharp as a tack! - You!
and fit!
we found a note. The body's been here at least three days. Maybe more
all signs point to an 11 - 44.
three 11 - 44s in four months? Here must be something in the water.
all right, ladies and gentlemen, listen up.
you know the procedure. I want this done right.
I do not want any mistakes.
Hey, Blowie.
I know you're new but if you want to get your spit all over the evidence, why don't you just lick it?
clearly he doesn't need any more coffee.
okay, there's the dead guy. Can we go now?
relax. We just got here. Have some Mee Krob.
how do you just eat when there's a dead guy laying there?
what, is that rude? Am I supposed to share?
forensics.
act natural.
Oh, that's it!
what? What do you see?
red pepper flakes.
is that a clue or something?
no, it's a delicious spice and it's exactly what my Mee Krob needs. I told you this
what are you doing? This is a crime scene You can't touch stuff.
what?
seriously, check this out.
a marinating steak?
what, you want to eat that too?
no, but don't you find that a little odd?
that a man would eat a steak?
that a man who was ready to kill himself would take the time to marinate a steak for a future meal?
dude...
this was not suicide.
this was murder.
the door latch is still intact.
now, I ask you, if you were gonna kill yourself wouldn't you want the door to be locked so no one could barge in on you?
what?
I don't -- what is -- I don't
what in the name of sweet justice are you two doing in my crime scene?
your crime scene? That's funny I didn't see your name on it.
Heh heh. Get out.
we are. Just thought you might want to know that this thing here, not a suicide.
great. Thanks for that. Really.
and thanks also for bringing a snack to the crime scene.
Oh, boy!
I'm sensing a...
I'm sensing there was someone here someone here in the room with the victim when he died.
someone with a sliver of grease on his or her shoe.
no, I'm not sensing a struggle. No struggle...
the door.
did you have to break down the door when you got here?
no, it was open. Why? - No, no, no, don't encourage him.
get up.
Mcnab, I want you to escort these two men out of here now.
Oh, come on. Let me read the witnesses You know, due diligence.
Spencer, we did the due diligence.
it was a suicide. There is no crime. There are no witnesses.
you're wrong.
there is a witness.
there's a cat.
I want to talk to that cat.
as soon as he's finished...licking himself.
Wow. I'm jealous.
can't believe you took that cat.
Gus, they were going to ship him off to an animal shelter. What choice did I have?
plus this cat is the lead witness in a major murder investigation.
you want to hold him? - Oh, no, you don't. I am not touching that cat
you took the cat, you carry it.
we're right on this thing now I didn't have anything substantial.
a steak? The chain in the door? A stain on the carpet? I wouldn't have believed me.
we needed an "in," now we have one plus he clearly likes you. Give him a snuggle.
you know, I'm actually going to enjoy this you having to carry this cat around, pretending you can communicate with it.
I'm buying a disposable camera for when you have to clean out his dirty litter box.
let me tell you something.
this cat here is a gift a conduit for us to save lives and he has more integrity in his little furry hand...
paw.
paw, than most people have in their whole... appendages...
appendages.
what?
all of...
than most people have in all of their appendages...
combined.
Oh yeah? I think he wants to sleep on your chair.
how long are you going to keep this up for?
until we solve the crime.
don't you or your cat get mad at me but I don't think there was a crime.
Oh, really? You don't think so? - No
try telling that to this poor little guy who was traumatized seeing his owner killed.
tell him.
I'm just saying I can kinda get where Lassiter is coming from.
a few suicides is not uncommon.
Gus, did you look at the sky today?
blue, clear...and did you feel it out there?
warm. Nice. Statistically, people in mild climates are far less likely to kill themselves.
now, if we were in Vladivostok, we could talk.
the point is, at the end of the day this was a 50-year-old man living alone with a cat.
do you want down? You can get down.
you're probably right.
I know I'm right.
it's probably a suicide.
thank you.
that was big of you to admit.
I'm unclear on one little thing.
what's that?
how do we explain the second body they just found?
detective O'hara.
well, you're here all by yourself?
damn it all.
could have happened to anybody.
talk to me.
well, victim is a female in her late 20s Gloria Starks.
we're waiting for forensics to confirm but it appears to be a suicide Carbon monoxide poisoning. Asphyxiation.
Ooh, I'm afraid the cat doesn't think so.
turn around and walk away.
this cat can tell us if the killer has been here.
all I need is 30 seconds. Watch this.
you ready, boy? Huh? You ready? What? What, over here?
where? What...
that is
that is very thoughtful. I'll tell him.
he says the fact that you take three creams and four sugars in your coffee?
dangerous.
is that true? Do you really take three creams and four sugars?
so what?
so what? That is a heart attack waiting to happen. You're still a young man.
that was amazing. How did you do that?
it was a lucky guess.
don't you get tired of saying that?
with your permission I'd like the little boy cat to sniff out the car.
absolutely not.
what did I just say?
just relax and let him do his job. He might find something.
he's peeing.
no. No, he's drawing your attention to the evidence in the back seat.
by peeing on it. Nice.
come here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
nice kitty.
Yes, did you make good pee-pee?
did you make good pee-pee? Yes, you did.
what?
that's -- that's a little inappropriate.
I'm sorry, that's rude.
he was just saying that he would have done the same thing if he'd killed himself.
he would have swung by the dry cleaner's and grabbed the pantsuit first.
maybe she picked up the dry cleaning days ago.
did the cat ever think of that?
what is he doing right here?
he is measuring the amount of carbon monoxide emitted.
okay. I knew that.
Yeah, you did.
now, does she strike you as the type that would go for heavy metal?
any number of people could have changed her radio station.
Mr. Spencer, if you and your new partner are finished urinating on things
I believe your work here is done.
check out the dry cleaning. - I'm on it.
look, I don't care what Lassiter says the cat is not my new partner, Gus.
don't be ridiculous.
then tell me again why the cat gets to ride shotgun.
he gets car sick, and you know this.
do you want him to throw up again back there? Is that what you want?
that's not funny, Shawn.
here. Lay these down.
he's doing fine. Aren't you?
this is a company car, Shawn.
that means I have to return it in like-new condition. Lay these down.
look at this. - What?
70% off all storm doors and window panes? Everything must go?
Gus, flip it over. It's her.
struggling actress lands big break in Santa Barbara play.
and then kills herself? I don't think so.
okay, you might be on to something.
the play's called "Dazzle and Stretch."
dazzle and Stretch?
I was wondering if I could ask you a...
a question. I could really use some advice.
Yeah, all right.
get on in here.
what can I do for you, Mcnab?
it's just that--you're still married, right?
are you trying to piss me off? - No, sir. No, I
I just have a question.
on your wedding night, did you feel any...
well, any added pressure to perform? - Excuse me?
it's just that my francie is going to be expecting a lot on our first night as a married couple, and I was wondering if you had any tips for me.
what the hell kind of sick bastard are you?
thank you very much, sir. I appreciate it.
so what you're trying to tell me is now it's the cat that's convinced these weren't suicides?
Yes.
do you really think I'm going to open a bunch of closed cases just because a cat tells me to?
this is it.
Yes. This is it.
the girl that was found in her car Gloria Starks.
she's here. She's here with us.
Oh, despair!
I fear that you will leave me!
what choice do I have?
I dazzle and I stretch
I dazzle...
and I stretch what the hell is going on in here?
Mr. Spencer, this is telling me nothing.
he can't hear you right now, 'cause, see he's channeling the cat who's channeling Gloria.
I dazzle then what are we looking at?
I stretch bad acting.
I think she wants you to see something in the paper.
Gloria is trying to tell you something. - Stretch dazzle stretch...
70% off storm doors and window panes. Everything must go.
struggling actress lands big break in Santa Barbara play.
so what? - So what?
does that sound like a woman who would kill herself?
please, all actresses are crazies.
I know. I dated one in college once.
she had a nose ring.
good work, little buddy.
I don't know. This is something. - Something?
Oh, come on, you guys. That's the biggest thing that ever happened for that girl.
you need to stop waiting around for another suicide and start looking for a serial killer.
Spencer? Get off my lap.
what does this mean?
I have no idea, but I see it on numbers all the time and it seems to work for them.
you ready to give up?
four separate suicides two of which occurred before we came on the case and I don't see a pattern of any kind.
different ages, different sexes. Different socio-economic levels.
different methods of death.
no duplicate weapons, locations.
what do we got?
first we have a jumper, second, an oven, third, pills, fourth, carbon monoxide.
they all have to be connected somehow.
what I see is a whole lot of nothing.
nothing.
you see, sometimes, Shawn you don't need to dig so deep.
you just need to turn things upside down...
to make them right-side up.
and there's your prize.
wait a minute.
what are you doing?
I'm turning things upside down in order to make them right-side up.
and there's the prize.
this is the prize?
going to the first dead guy's place, and what?
talk to a dead guy?
no, we talk to dead guy's brother.
the dead guy's brother lives at the dead guy's place?
they were roommates, but that's the point.
he's getting rid of the apartment, and we're here to rent it.
we're what?
why can't we for once just talk to somebody as us?
because, Gus, I don't want him to be on guard.
if he thinks we're investigating something he'll clam up.
Wes Hiltonbock. - Yeah.
Hey, Shawn Spencer.
I talked to you on the phone about the apartment.
this is Gus. It would actually be for both of us.
Yeah. Okay, come in.
Thanks, man.
just so you guys know, the utilities are included but I would require first and last month and a sizable security deposit.
Oh, that's not a problem. Do you take cats?
Yeah, I guess so. You two guys have a cat?
we do, actually. He's sort of like our child.
I see. How do you guys know each other?
we're partners.
gotcha. - Oh, no, no
no, no, it's fine. Really, I'm totally fine.
no. We're partners in a private-- - relationship.
believe it. It's been a while.
we finish each other's sentences.
so, tell me, Wes, why would you want to give up such a handsome apartment?
do you not like it anymore?
Ooh! Gus!
good news. Shower for two.
uh, actually, I just have some bad memories here.
I used to live here with my brother but he passed away.
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Was he sick, or?
he killed himself.
Oh, good lord. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry. - Yeah, me too.
we were real close, you know.
was he depressed? I mean, were there signs? Did you
what am I -- I'm sorry. You don't have to answer those questions.
no.
actually, I had no idea anything was wrong, you know.
I mean, he had so much to live for.
he's a great guy, you know.
smarter than me, more talented.
he was a great singer.
he was really going places.
so, look, are you guys interested in the place, or?
what do you think, honey?
I think it's great. I think it's perfect.
all right, then I've got another couple coming by later, so...
but I'll let you guys know either way.
shower for two?
that was so I could see your face when I said it.
you know, you enjoy these things more than you should.
I suffered through that for no reason. We learned nothing.
Yes, but I grabbed this while we were up there.
you took his mail?
it's not like I took his sports illustrated. It's a phone bill.
you can't open someone else's mail. It's a federal offense!
Gus, he's dead. - So what?
I'll hold it to my head and read it psychically.
hurry up, Shawn.
Gus, who's going to see us? - Hurry up.
why, there's like--there's like 16 calls here to some 1-800 stress line...
including the last call he made.
I've seen the ads for that. So what?
a depressed guy calls a stress line.
I betcha a hungry guy calls a pizza place.
that doesn't tell us anything.
Yeah, but it might get us a link.
I'm gonna run the other victims' phone records.
with what? Your do-it-yourself phone record running kit?
the next best thing.
the answer is in the phone bills.
I need you to run the victims' phone records.
what? No cat this time?
Julie, I am very serious about this. I have a strong sense about a stress line, and I know the link is in the phone records.
I don't know why you would think I would do something like this for you.
some have said it's the hair.
Really? Who says that?
Oh, guess what. We already ran the phone records and checked out the dry cleaning. Pantsuits were picked up over a week ago.
what kind of dog and pony show do you think we run here?
Gus, you want to take this one? - No.
let me put an end to this non-case.
Yes, all the victims called the 1 - 800 stress line, not just once, many times over.
detective Lassiter and I have combed everything.
we've gone to the bone on these. - All the way to the bone?
I know this is hard for you to grasp but these people did have something in common.
they were troubled, and they were depressed, and as sad as that is, they all committed suicide.
case closed.
we've clearly wasted your time.
it's not over, is it? - Of course not.
they all called the same help line and they all killed themselves? Come on!
Shawn, that's what stressed people do.
it's strange how he gave up so easily.
Yeah, it is.
maybe we should take a closer look at that stress line.
Gloria Starks only called that line because she was stressed about an audition.
you call a help line, they find you dead?
that's not very helpful.
what if someone there is killing the callers and making it look like a suicide?
Gus, we go to the stress line,
I think we solve the case.
come on.
what is this?
you're looking at our new business. Mazel Tov.
are you out of your mind?
you rented office space for this?
Gus, don't be a crazy hooligan. I rented a sign.
now, let's go say hello to our new neighbors.
Hello, everyone! Who wants pineapple?
be honest. You guys can slice it up and fight over it later.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. May I help you?
I'm Terrance. I run the line here.
Terrance. Hello. I'm Shawn Spencer. This is my partner, Gus Sillypants Jackson.
just came by to say hello. We've opened up our own little 1 - 800 thingy down the hall.
not as big as you guys. More of a closet, really.
your own 1 - 800...thingy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's called "dial a psychic."
maybe you recognize us. I'm the lead psychic for the Santa Barbara police department.
the Mccallum murders.
the Edmond robberies? Over there. You? Nothing? Nothing?
what, do you guys live in this room?
so you can know stuff about me just by looking at me?
Yeah. Pretty much.
do it. - Do it?
go ahead. Show us.
looking for a little demo.
well, they don't like pineapple.
I don't know, guys. I don't think big T wants us to take up any more of
Oh, no, no, no, no. Go right ahead.
half the lines are down, the phones are being worked on right now. We have time for your little trick.
Oh yeah?
let's see what I can come up with.
loose, flowing stanzas, Bobby Frost.
are you a poet, by chance?
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
how did you know that?
I guess you could say I'm a bit of a psychic poet.
Oh, please. Stop.
cause I'm, like...I'm freaking out.
do you see his eyeliner?
the guy could be the drummer from the cure.
you can see why you come out here to eat. It's beautiful.
the sound of the seagulls, the smell of the ocean the salt air...
I never noticed. What do you got there?
it's what you asked for.
I ran the sheets on all the volunteers at the stress line.
do you mind? It's police business.
Scram!
let's see what we got here. Well, look there.
it's a picture of an old friend.
Hey, Rory.
where the hell have you been?
I've been sitting on this mop bucket in this tiny closet for the last hour and a half.
waiting for you to show up, I'm all cramped.
well, get up, man. Do some pushups or something I need you light and limber.
do some pushups?
sure, like Clint Eastwood in Escape from Alcatraz.
sure, he spends the whole movie in the tiny little cell, right?
but he's in the best shape of his entire life.
give me a little piece of tape.
what happened to the big ticking time clock?
Gus, what do you think I've been doing all day?
my work happens here...and here.
what are you doing?
I am trying to create a pleasant work environment, and I can tell by looking at your little area that you don't care.
we don't work here, Shawn.
we do until we solve these murders but don't worry. I have a plan.
you are going to call the stress line and pretend to be depressed - No, I'm not - Yes and I'll go down the hall when you make the call.
ask for Rory so that I can see him in action.
why don't you call him? - Gus, please be serious for one second.
no one's going to believe that I'm depressed.
I've got an idea. Why don't you have the cat make the call?
he's like your new partner, right? Where is he, anyway?
Gus, he's far more comfortable in your car, plus I need him well rested for when he identifies the killer.
now, wait exactly two seconds, and then make the call.
I have no idea what I'd even say.
here's a good opener. Hello, my name's Gus.
I have a deep-seated jealousy for a tiny little boy cat.
why would you put them on speaker phone? See, because I think that tends to undercut
big T! Look sharp.
what is it now, Mr. Spencer?
just wanted to pick your brain how many lines do you got going here?
well, I have 12 lines but I'm adding more all the time.
I get it. I get it. The more lines the more green, am I right?
I'm a non-profit operation. The calls are free.
I'm not in this for the money.
Really? That's weird.
see, I'm thinking of charging four bucks a minute.
Hey, Ror. - Hey.
wow, you really do love your music, huh?
you kidding? Music inspires me.
Yeah, you know you don't really strike me as the...
charitable type. - I was going to say "sensitive," but sure
actually, I'm here as part of a community service on this assault beef.
I got into it with this guy who didn't like my poetry, so...
250 hours.
two fitty? Wow. That's intense.
Rory? Take line six!
I'll let you get back to work. - Sorry.
Hello, stress line.
the extra "s" is for extra stress. This is Rory.
so you're experiencing some stress.
career and personal?
well, yeah, I suppose.
I mean, my career's not exactly where I would like it to be.
no. No, I don't have a girlfriend right now.
it's been a while.
right.
right. That's not good.
um, does it make you have dark thoughts?
like how dark are you talking?
like "wanna be dead"?
okay, easy. Now, I just want to say this like, right off the bat.
suicide is not the answer.
who said anything about suicide?
I just said maybe I should find a new hobby like coin collecting, or something at the beach.
I like water activities.
like drowning?
what? Drowning?
I don't want to drown!
no, no, of course you don't. That's awful, okay?
but I don't care what you say about suicide in a lake being poetic, you know, like, your body floating to the top of the pristine serene waters, and your final breaths rippling out in an ever-widening circle, you know, like the circle of life but you have to stop that kind of thinking.
you have so much to live for.
you're damn straight. I have a lot to live for.
of course you do.
you see, I can tell this phone call is helping you already.
dude, what the hell was that?
was he trying to help me? I feel really creeped out.
dude, he put you on the creepy train headed for creep island where the natives drink creep nectar out of creepy coconut shells.
Shawn, it's horrible.
Yeah, sorry.
he's nuts, Shawn. - Yes.
and worst of all, he actually made some good points.
pharmaceutical sales? Not sexy.
you are my only non-work friend.
there's gotta be something wrong with that.
Hey, hey, hey, what is this? - What?
hang in there. - He's right.
I need to start taking some more risks.
does that mean we can go cliff-diving?
no. I'm being serious, Shawn.
look, would it make you feel any better If I told you Hiltonbock called? We got the apartment!
what would make me feel better is if we called the police!
this guy is dangerous, Shawn. Let's call Vick.
maybe get him arrested.
Gus, Gus... - what?
the only thing this guy is guilty of right now is being a bad poet.
you know how this game works.
we cannot just pick up the phone and beg the police to come and save us.
look, just...just stay away from the water for now.
final decision. We wait.
um, no, it's this way.
you sure? -Yes.
now, was that so hard?
maybe you'd care to explain this.
my eyeliner pencil?
so you admit it's yours.
funny how Gloria Starks' suicide note was scrawled across her windshield in black eyeliner yet no eyeliner was found at the crime scene.
you, my friend, are looking at exhibit "A."
bag it, O'hara.
you like your music, don't you, Rory?
Yeah, I do. It's my inspiration.
I bet. I bet it inspires you to kill.
that's why you couldn't resist playing your big-haired, drug-induced death music on Mortimer Tilden's stereo while you forced him to swallow all those pills, or on Gloria Starks' car radio while she slipped into unconsciousness, and even now.
let's have a little listen, shall we?
what, you think you can pull a fast one on me, switching out your head-thrashing crap for this noise?
this crap is all I listen to.
I hate metal music.
I use the details that I get from callers to write better poems.
I'm not a killer. - No, you're a poet...
but you're also an assaulter, aren't you?
who do you think arrested you on that assault charge?
Oh, a guy from the phone company found the victim.
I didn't kill anybody.
get him out of my sight.
what? You're not taking notes?
how could you let him do that?
now Lassiter gets credit for solving a crime and we don't get paid.
Oh, we're gonna get paid. - How do you figure?
Lassiter didn't solve the crime Rory's innocent. He didn't do it.
he didn't? - No.
then who did?
just grip the spike with your little foot and climb! Come on!
why do I got to go up first?
cause you're a climbing machine, Gus.
just, you know, be careful.
grip the spike with your foot! Okay, okay, okay.
grease.
dude! Dude! Dude! I know who the killer is.
can I come down, then?
no, no, I have to figure out where he's headed.
who is he? - Well, put it this way.
taking the apartment isn't such a good idea, unless you think it's cool that our would-be landlord is a serial killer.
there was a pattern.
see, all the murders coincide with dates that Hiltonbock was servicing the phone lines.
that's when he had access. - With this?
Yes. Yeah, yeah, send that down.
perfect!
see, this device stores all the incoming and outgoing calls.
my guess is whatever number he dialed last, that's where Hiltonbock is headed and whoever that is probably his next victim.
Hello, you've reached Buzz Mcnab.
I'm not in right now, but please do leave a message, and I will get back to you when I get in.
Oh, no.
who are you calling?
Hello, chief? Hey, uh, Shawn Spencer here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, I'm getting a vibe right now as big as a buick.
stay, boy cat!
Hey, Mcnab. So this is the place, huh?
it's nice. It's really nice.
drop it! - Don't come any closer!
I will drop you! - I swear to god I'm going to shoot him!
drop it! - Everybody, breathe. Just breathe.
get out of here.
wow, the other ones must have gone a lot smoother than this, huh, Hiltonbock?
Yeah, comparatively, it was probably pretty easy to get Mortimer Tilden to swallow those pills.
you want to die, old man, huh? Eat them.
because you are not really a cold-blooded serial killer, are you?
he only threw his own brother off a building.
I didn't push him off the roof. - No, no, no, no. No, you didn't.
you didn't do that.
but you were there. You saw it. You saw the whole thing.
you saw him jump off the balcony of the apartment that you shared.
he was weak. There's a lot of weak people out there, Hiltonbock
you going to track them all down, huh? One at a time?
punish them for their weakness?
you want to get back at your brother so badly you don't even...
you don't even care who these people were just that they called a line.
look, you were going to kill Mcnab here just because he had a few pre-wedding jitters.
I was just looking for a little advice.
nobody else would talk to me.
it's okay, Buzz.
we all have stress. All of us.
right here in this room I mean, take a good look, Hiltonbock.
we all have problems. Who else deserves to get shot or hung?
maybe it's Gus. - That's enough, Spencer.
Oh, shoot him.
what are you doing?
Yeah, maybe I should.
don't listen to him! He's a crazy person. He's crazy.
that's right. I am crazy.
so maybe you should shoot me. - Okay.
here's the best part.
it doesn't matter what I think because you have a problem that's a lot bigger than me...
this guy. The man with his gun trained on you is not only a fine human being with a strong Irish hairline, he is an exemplary public servant, and arguably the finest detective mind in the lower western Santa Barbara county area...
over the age of 35, and right now, while I'm speaking, he is devising a swift and stealth-like tactic that is going to disarm you...
and blow your freaking mind.
any time you're ready.
all right, we've got to make the move.
that was adequate, Spencer.
don't thank me. Thank the little boy cat.
there you are! There's my big guy.
there's my big guy. You're a hero!
you're a hero today. Yes.
speaking of heroes, Mcnab, I was going to get you something off the registry online but it turns out the chief already got you the asparagus steamer, so...
instead, I give you this little guy.
Yeah.
if you take him in the car he likes to ride up front.
shotgun.
there's something beautiful about the color fruity puffs turns the milk.
I think it's the most beautiful thing in the whole world.
I've been thinking.
you're not the only one who has a charmed life, Shawn.
I've got it pretty good too.
Yes, you do, and it makes me glad to hear you say so
I mean, the other day at work, this dermatologist, Katie Finestatt, commented how I looked handsome carrying my sample case into her office.
Finestatt said that? - Yes, she did.
and she is fine.
so it got me thinking maybe pharmaceutical sales can be sort of sexy.
there are times when I have to stand a few feet away because you're literally sizzling.
you see what I'm saying? I mean, you may be my only non-work friend.
but you're my best friend and how many best friends does one guy need, really?
that's my point.
it's all in the attitude, Gus. - Exactly.
not sweating the small stuff.
life's too short. -Too short.
changing my attitude, Shawn.
where the hell is my prize? Where's my ring, Shawn?
easy, now.
no, no. I timed the bowls out perfectly, Shawn.
me, then you, then me, then you then I get the prize.
so what happened to not sweating the small stuff?
life's too short? All that?
did you open the bottom of the box?
why would I do something like that?
that's my ring.
you know I would kill for that ring, don't you?
uh, you're upsetting me.
you just changed my mood from an orangey yellow to a muddy brown.
you need to say something sweet, quick.
that's so childish and...
I'm going to eat yours.
faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than
Hey.
Hey.
Where'd these comics come from?
Gus, right?
come here.
well, at least you're not a tattletale.
what's the big deal? All the kids read them.
Yeah, well, all the kids don't live in this house, and all the kids don't have a police officer as a father, Shawn.
so what?
so these things make cops look like idiots who'd rather flash their signal in the sky than do real police work.
they set a bad example. - They do not.
Shawn, don't argue with me.
do you have any idea of how many kids' brains I have to scoop up off of the driveway - because they think they can fly? - Those kids are dumb.
Shawn, these things are a fantasy.
real heroes do not wear a cape, and they don't wear their underwear on the outside.
the guys who wear capes...
they're on angel dust.
come here.
you want to know what a real hero is?
what?
he's flesh and blood, he wears a badge, and he lays it on the line every time he walks the beat.
do you really want to be a hero someday?
Yes, sir.
become a cop...
and get your head out of the clouds.
all right, let's see if we can make this thing useful somehow.
hit the showers.
present day
somebody needs a hot oil massage.
pardon? - Stress?
tough day at the office? Who are you kidding?
you'll probably never get those reports typed.
who is this? - Shawn.
great, you were already thinking about me.
you know, you should roll your head both directions if you really want that to work.
okay, where are you?
on the phone. Where are you?
you know damn well where I am. How can you see me?
do you really want to know?
I don't ask questions I don't want to know the answer to.
then never ask a boyfriend if he thinks your sister's hot.
I don't have a sister. - How about a boyfriend?
where are you?
well, there's a spectral plane where all of our auras are visible, see, and when a soul is tortured or stressed, like yourself
okay, never mind. - You asked.
I have a really hectic day today. The chief, she's
out of the office.
going to the seminar on non-lethal weaponry with Lassiter, out of town.
she sort of left you in charge.
okay, psychic.
give me the details. How did you figure that out?
most of it is in her day planner.
you cannot be in the chief's office.
Oh, come on. She's not going to know.
you notice how no one ever looks in here? Why is that?
what are you guys so afraid of? It's not like the belly bites.
she's actually a pretty kickback lady, if you give her a chance.
look what she's done with this place. It's really warm in here.
I know I can't stay away. And have you tried this chair?
okay, you have five seconds to get your butt out of
actually, you know what? Stay right there.
Oh. Indecisive. I like that.
take a look at that. Tell me what you think.
flower doodle in the upper corner is excellent...
but this horse at the bottom doesn't look anything like my little pony.
the writing, not
that's a dog.
I draw when I get anxious.
I think you made a wise decision not going into animation, Juliet.
okay, fine. Something about a missing kid.
he's not a kid, he's 18, and he's only been gone for 24 hours, so technically, he's not missing.
you want my help. - I'm not sure yet.
his name is Malone Breyfogle.
I can tell you this much - kid's been lifted up by his underwear more than once.
he seems like a good kid.
honor roll. Never been in trouble.
his mother's worried sick.
but you can't do anything until he's been missing for 48 hours.
that's so stupid. - Exactly.
I know the rules and regulations. They made sense when I memorized them.
but when you have to look into some poor mother's eyes and tell her she can't worry about her son until he's two days missing...
that is really depressing. Consider me hired.
you're not hired. I can't pay you.
if it turns out there's something to it, I'll make sure you get put on the case.
that's all I can do. - Juliet...
I'm quite sure we can work out some kind of services exchange.
you see, I like to do a little sketching myself, and sometimes...
I need a model.
was that inappropriate?
felt okay.
let me get this straight
I left in the middle of work to come check out a case which is not a case in which we likely won't get paid?
who are you kidding right now?
I pulled you out of a Starbucks, where you were pretending to finish your route that you actually finished yesterday, so we could do a tiny favor for Juliet that will grant us much larger favors in the future...
preferably ones that I can't mention in the presence of nuns or men of the cloth.
Oh, hello. Thank you so much for coming.
come in.
can I get you boys anything?
they'll be ready in a minute.
I can't believe you're letting that woman make us pancakes.
she offered, Gus.
tell me you're not excited about pancakes.
she's worried sick. - Cooking helps her cope.
how do you know that? - How do you know it doesn't?
do you boys want your syrup warmed up?
I don't need it, Mrs. Breyfogle, but Gus does, so,
I guess, yes.
you're the one who won't eat cold syrup.
Yeah, but I'm working you into the conversation. Now she knows your name.
I'm just afraid something terrible has happened.
here you go.
my son, Malone, has been acting so strange lately.
strange how?
Well...he worked so hard to get a paid summer internship with a big computer company, then turned it down at the last second.
wouldn't tell me why.
he rarely leaves his room.
even his two oldest friends, Rob and Don, tell me they hardly get to see him.
have you spoken with Rob and Don since Malone disappeared?
no, I spoke to their parents.
both boys are at computer camp.
all right.
these are delicious... - Yes.
but I need to see his room.
are you all right?
I feel...
the answer is in the light.
the light?
will you tell the spirit to hurry the hell up?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I'm definitely feeling something here.
Oh, it's good.
it's nice.
what? What is it?
this mattress.
it feels like one of those mattresses where you can bounce a bowling ball but the glass of wine doesn't spill.
Gus, go find a glass of wine and a bowling ball.
Mrs. Breyfogle...
I feel...
we'll find a clue in here.
how does some 18-year-old kid still living at home rate that kind of money?
lemonade stand?
that is, if instead of lemons, he's using heroin.
whatever it is, anything that pays in stacks of cash like that can't be legal... or healthy.
it's obvious what happened.
Malone was involved in some shady dealings.
he's either off on a spending spree, or things got a little too shady for him.
so, what now?
find his friends. Computer camp?
please. Malone's rolling in dough.
whatever he's doing, they're with him. We find them, we find him.
the question is, where?
wait a second.
you don't already know where he is?
Gus, I'm a professional at gathering information, okay?
I'm getting there.
you know, Shawn, I...
I just thought you were a little better than this.
just a little. - All right, what is this?
you know where he is? - Of course I do.
while you were playing with light switches and ordering breakfast,
I was investigating a case.
I see.
okay.
okay, I'll bite.
where is he, chocolate Columbo?
what?
the tri-annual comic book and science fiction convention is in Santa Barbara this weekend.
you saw all those comic books in Malone's room.
you're 18 years old, you have a ton of cash burning a hole in your pocket, and you love comics?
where else would you go to spend your disposable income?
think, Shawn.
Gus, I apologize. That's brilliant. - Thank you.
let's verify it so we can go check it out.
Shawn, I'm sure he's there. There's no doubt.
you sure?
Yep. - How's that?
are those directions to the convention center?
I found it in his wastebasket.
you know, in case I never said it,
I was really pleased when you were named as chief...
interim chief.
I'm sure that's only temporary.
and it's true that the outgoing chief was important to me.
he was my mentor.
made me the cop I am today.
I know the outside perception is that the force was a real boys' club under him, so I thought it was really smart when they named a...
you know... woman.
all right, honey.
excuse me. What?
I love you.
huh? - Okay...
Yeah, I'll just see you when we get back.
okay.
I'm sorry, detective. Were you saying something?
no, I wasn't.
we can't just walk into the con.
I'm sorry... "the con"?
Yeah.
you're calling a place filled with overweight teenagers battling mild cases of scoliosis and advanced bedwetting "the con"?
we can't get in there. The tickets were sold out a month ago.
did you already try to get tickets?
focus, Shawn. - How much were they?
will you focus?
no, no, no, no, no.
leave this out of sight until we get the issues resolved with the food in his room.
I don't know if he's going to walk over the blueberry issue, but we cannot have people lining up until we're sure he's participating.
I got to call his agent. Get me a list of all the produce vendors in the area.
we can't risk alienating the star trek fans.
you can't come in without tickets.
they didn't tell you we were coming?
who? - We work for George.
you mean "Ka-kay"?
Yeah, those closest to him know exactly how he likes it pronounced.
you think you can have a convention without commander Chekov?
Sulu, jackass.
have his fresh blueberries arrived yet?
I don't have record of receiving them yet.
you don't have record of having received them yet.
give me that.
they don't have the fresh blueberries.
w-what's the big deal? - What's the big deal?
what is the big deal?
do you have any idea what happened when they forgot his blueberries at the con in San Antonio?
that comb-over'll be the least of your...
you know what? It's better...
it's better if you don't know.
it's how I ended up with a stutter and a wooden pinkie toe.
now, for the love of Scotty - still Sulu.
would you
P-please...
let me get in there and save all of our asses?
dude...
some guy in a wolf costume with a lightsaber just said hi to you.
I don't know that guy.
he looked right at you.
he was mistaken.
he said,"hi, Gus."
and then another dude with a cape and a codpiece gave you a half-nod.
I don't know any of these people, Shawn.
Hey, guys. I'm Talia. This is Dent.
we're with Parastone pictures, and wanted to remind you to see the world premiere of The Red Phantom trailer tomorrow night.
it'll be the biggest movie of the summer. Do not miss out.
no way. I love the dead phantom.
red phantom.
what, he didn't die at the end?
Bye.
I hear this movie's going to bomb.
it's too bad. I kind of dug the red phantom.
you haven't even seen the trailer and you already hate it? How's that possible?
fortress of attitude.
what did you just say to me?
fortress of attitude.
it's this site that reviews movies based on comic books.
the malcontent, the guy who runs it, says he already saw a 30-minute presentation here at the convention.
blazed it online.
can't you just look at porn on the net like every other guy and his brother?
everybody reads this blog.
no, not everybody.
everybody here does, Shawn...
and you know what? I don't care what you think.
so why don't you let me do the talking here at the convention, and try not to embarrass me.
this is my turf.
and yes, I knew the guy in the codpiece.
his name is Dave, and he's a very nice guy.
snap.
two for 50 cents.
what? - That's Hiltz Kooler.
excuse me, Mr. Kooler?
I'm a huge Green Spirit fan.
he's my favorite, actually. I was wondering...
would you mind signing my original copy of The Green Spirit strikes again?
whoa. Haven't seen one of these in a while.
I couldn't believe I found a guy selling one.
I love how this reinvented the character for today.
well, there you go. Enjoy. It's one of my favorites.
you know, I wish they'd based the movie on this story arc.
what am I going to do? I told them about a million times, but they don't listen to me.
still a huge fan.
well, I'm glad someone is after that Green Spirit movie.
wait, wait, wait.
is this the movie you dragged me to where the hero had big nipples on the outside of his costume?
damn those nipples.
they were, like, big, angry, marshmallows.
be nice to him, Shawn.
the green spirit movie nearly killed the character.
Gus, all I care about is finding our guys.
I can't take much more of this.
there's too much real estate. We can't cover it all at once.
maybe we should split up.
I can help our situation.
so, next...
next on our list...
sir, can I help you?
Yeah, I'm Shawn Spencer. Psychic... sbpd.
I'll just need a moment. - Psychic? Welcome!
ladies and gentlemen, science fiction fans, we've got a special treat for you today.
we have a psychic, a real, live, professional psychic.
Shawn, no.
who's this?
this is, uh...
is my sidekick, magichead.
you're a psychic, like professor x?
professor x is a telepath, not a psychic.
but I do have telepathic tendencies.
no, you don't. You have psychic visions. They're different.
no, really, I can do both.
no, you can't.
can you read me? - Sure.
I'm getting a reading. I'm getting a reading right now, yes.
you...
spend a great deal of time in front of your computer.
and I see a girl. Yes.
you like her... from afar.
she doesn't really know you exist.
Yes, yes. Her name's Megan.
do I have a chance?
don't put too much work into it.
I think she might want to be... "just friends."
we're supposed to be looking for Malone.
obviously, Malone is keeping a low profile.
Whoa! Boy!
I'm getting - whoa! I'm getting an "r."
I am getting an "r"!
does anyone here have a name that begins with "r"?
Oh, wait a second! Whoa... hold... nobody...
and a "d." Yes, a "d."
an "r" and a "d." An "r" name...
uh, Rim...
uh, Rolf... uh, Robber...
no "ber," just Rob. Rob and a "d" name.
Yes, uh... uh, Dan...
uh, doodle...
Duder. Dom... Don! Yes!
rob and a Don!
that's us! - That's us!
an actual Rob and Don together.
that's... sometimes I scare myself.
Hey, fellas. First, I need you both to empty your pockets.
a room key... even though you both reside locally.
Oh... our friend sprang for a hotel suite for us.
Ah, room 129.
428. - Yes, of course.
I'm getting something.
this friend you speak of, I sense you haven't seen him for a while, but you didn't tell anyone.
no, you're not supposed to be here.
you told your parents...
you were going to computer camp.
computer camp, guys? Really?
I know what you're hiding!
we're not going after them?
what for? Malone's not with them.
but I think I know where he might be.
ladies and gentlemen, Shawn Spencer!
and - and Magichead!
let's check out room 428.
well, they seemed pretty convincing. That's them there.
why are you telling people you're my assistants?
uh...
because we are your assistants.
excuse me?
are you serious, George?
I know we said we'd work outside the loop, but this is a little ridiculous.
I don't recognize you.
you hired us personally.
we met you in chicago, at a screening of that movie with the whales.
star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.
the last time I was in Chicago, I was doing a reading from my autobiography.
right. We booked that.
remember, Robin told us he'd never be able to fill a room that size?
I don't know any Robins.
that's because I fired her. Look, George, you don't need that kind of negativity, okay?
it's her fault what happened in San Antonio. Though...
you didn't hear that from me.
I'm very confused.
look, George, we can stand around and talk all day...
like Robin used to.
or I can try to do something about solving your blueberry crisis.
the choice is yours.
well, all right, then. Get to it.
thank you.
thank you.
EW! - Gosh!
I see why Rob and Don were freaked.
they didn't want to be held responsible for this mess.
this place is trashed.
maybe johnny depp stopped by.
I'm sorry. Did that joke just arrive in a time machine from 1992?
he used to trash hotel rooms. - Used to.
the man has kids now. He lives in France.
you got a better version? - Of course I do.
how about that lame-o who's dating Kate Moss?
he's British, and nobody knows who he is.
okay, fine. Too inside.
stephen Dorff. Always solid.
dude...
come here.
why would this kid have these mockups?
because I think our missing person has a secret identity.
by day, he's a laptop-toting, comic-loving virgin.
at night...
he's your favorite blogger.
you think the malcontent is the kid?
he must've pissed off the wrong people with his blog.
Shawn, look.
one down two to go
there goes the kid- on-a-spending-spree theory.
I just went over the posts on Malone's blog.
did he bash anything in particular?
the Red Phantom movie. He's relentless.
it's weird, because if you go back a little, he was originally saying great things about it.
so...
so Parastone pictures paid him to praise The Red Phantom flick.
that must be where all the money from his room came from.
makes sense.
Malone's blog started the bad buzz which sunk Parastone's last comic book movie.
I don't think the nipples helped either, Gus. - Well, yeah.
so the studio had everything riding on this new film.
they would've done anything to prevent history from repeating itself.
but Malone blazed The Red Phantom anyway.
he reneged, which might be why he's missing. We need to find those execs.
Hey. Any progress?
I picked up Malone's astral trail.
that's what it's called.
it leads to a hotel across from the convention center. Room 428.
oak door, can't miss it.
that's more specific than usual.
sometimes the spirits are in a giving mood.
now, you won't find Malone, but I sense some seriously dark juju-magumbo went down in there.
Yeah, send some uniforms to the hotel across from the convention center and tell them to cordon off room 428.
good.
this had better be for real.
so, how's the convention? A lot of cool stuff going on, I bet.
Oh, come on. Not you, too.
you're a collector, too? - Since middle school.
I just got Hiltz Kooler's autograph.
shut up. You did not.
Yes, I did.
Hi. Missing kid. Worried mom. Can we focus here?
since when did you get so structured?
since you turned into urkel, and - and you...
just became...
Tina Yothers... there's... it's...
there's not an exact...
match for that.
you didn't want to tell her about our suspicions of the Parastone executives?
please, Gus. We have to leave something to divine later.
yeah...
this is nice.
some good one-on-one time.
letting the guard down.
you know, I had an idea not too long ago, and it's funny I should think of it now, but it really doesn't make any sense to have so many officers working the daytime shift at grab.
detective - most car thefts occur at night.
Lassiter - if you were to split the shift
now, go with me on this one - Carlton!
what? - My water just broke.
are you sure? - No, Carlton.
there's water spilling out of me for some other reason.
Oh, no.
Oh, can you move my briefcase? - Your briefcase?
it might be in the line of the
do you understand how uncomfortable this is?
it's leather. I didn't Scotch-guard it.
you know what?
no, never mind.
it just has tremendous sentimental value.
just take me to the nearest hospital, all right?
Oh, I don't think we need that.
Oh, I think we do. In fact, you know what?
I'll use the siren, too. For you.
just in case.
Hey, guys. - Hey.
can't stop to talk. Got to sign autographs.
look, dude, I got a date with that Talia girl from the studio in, like, an hour.
a nice, romantic walk on the beach to Jim's.
best scungilli in Santa Barbara.
why couldn't you just talk to her now?
because, Gus, happy hour doesn't start until 5: 00.
you're supposed to be figuring out if she's innocent.
that's exactly what I plan to do.
the blueberries are still wrong.
I requested north Carolina blueberries, but they sent me Michigan blueberries.
people say I'm crazy, but I can taste the difference.
I don't think that's crazy at all. - And...
I requested that my green room not be at the end of the hall.
I have to be in the middle. It's affecting my chi.
Gus? - What?
did you skimp out and get the Michigan blueberries?
what? - And screw up the room location?
and what are you doing to George's chi? Are you touching it and whatnot? Stop it.
this is my fault, Mr. Takei.
my fault for farming out responsibilities that I should've seen to personally.
my humblest apologies.
we'll get you the right blueberries as soon as possible, and a better room assignment.
you have my word.
well, all right, then.
good help is hard to find, I suppose.
why did you blame that on me?
dude, we needed a fall guy.
I'm can't be the fall guy in front of one of my heroes, Shawn.
okay, you and I need to create a third imaginary assistant that's completely incompetent.
I think her name should be Beatrice.
what say you?
all right.
Yeah, just send it to my assistant.
it's tremendous.
you don't mind it, though. You don't mind all the comic book stuff.
it's fun, harmless.
a little wish-fulfillment.
Oh, come on.
you didn't pretend to fly around like superman when you were a kid?
so, uh, pretty high stakes on The Red Phantom movie, huh?
we took a bath a couple of years ago on this other comic book movie, the adventures of The Green Spirit.
Yeah, the nipple flick.
is that all anyone remembers about that movie?
Yes.
we had to build a landfill for the unsold action figures.
so we're pulling out all the stops to launch the trailer for The Red Phantom movie.
you know, lasers, music...
dent even organized this whole pyrotechnics display.
word of mouth is the first and most vital step in this world.
vital enough to pay somebody off?
what? - Hmm?
let's say there's a blogger, right?
and he's wielding way more power than he should, and he can be had for a price.
you guys would be fools not to take a shot, right?
who are you, Shawn? - I'm a psychic.
I work with the police. I'm investigating a disappearance.
the malcontent.
I'm sensing you probably know a lot about him.
okay, this conversation is over.
no, it's just starting to get good.
see, he reneged on a promise, and now he's missing.
missing?
look, whether or not this guy had a consultation fee is beside the point.
we don't harm people. It's just a movie.
just a movie.
you think your boss will tell me the same thing?
I don't know. Why don't we go ask him together?
dent is back at our convention headquarters.
fine.
so no scungilli, then?
I didn't expect you to be so cooperative, so if I seemed a little pushy
accusing me of kidnapping?
I accused you of bribery.
I implied you may have had something to do with the kidnapping.
there's a difference.
a lot of couples start off on the wrong foot.
it just means we have nowhere to go but up.
well, when you're done here with Dent, we're done.
what the...
Oh my god, what's happened here?
where is he?
some seriously dark juju-magumbo went down in here.
two down one to go
okay, good news
your boss is innocent.
bad news
he just became a face on a milk carton.
mchecked Malone's blogagain today.
there are more entries blazing The Red Phantom movie.
I think Malone was kidnapped before the blogs showed up.
he was probably going to honor his deal with Parastone.
so the kidnapper is the one roasting this new movie online?
he also wrote, "the guilty will pay."
"the guilty will pay." Wow.
one of these comic book freaks has clearly blurred the line between reality and...
comic book.
the kidnapper still has one more person to snatch.
and it appears he's targeting anyone involved in this bribery scam, so
Talia has to be the next victim.
we need to get the real police in here.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Mr. Takei. What can I do for you?
just name it.
hold on.
it's for you.
D-dawg. What's up, handsome?
I canned her. Yeah, she's out of here.
tonight?
absolutely, sir. I'll meet you there.
what? What's happening?
karaoke with George later.
get out of here.
this is a trek fan's dream come true.
awkward.
what?
well, he sort of just invited me.
you know what? Call him back.
tell him I said we need you for all the high harmonies.
this is messed up, Shawn.
no, this is messed up.
this isn't a churro.
Yeah, this is... I don't know what this is.
okay, I finally got ahold of your husband. He's on his way, but apparently, traffic is a nightmare.
thank you, Carlton.
everything's looking really good.
you just relax.
I'm going to go now, and let you...
no, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't... don't go.
you want me to stay?
well, yeah.
in class, I always had a coach, so just stand here and keep your eyes north of the equator.
Yeah, that won't be a problem.
are you ready for the epidural?
no, thank you. I'm going to do this naturally.
okay, we'll hold off, then.
are you insane? - I don't need it.
listen, I would put myself on a morphine pump if I were going to push 11 pounds of limbs and elbows out of my
I made my decision.
and I admire you for it.
have you considered this?
maybe the whole thing is a stunt.
what do you mean? - To promote the movie.
the whole scenario's just... so fantastical.
it's like a plot to a comic book.
dent could have arranged it, maybe Talia.
it could have been all three of them.
it's just so theatrical, with the cryptic notes, and
Hi! - Hi.
Gus said you've seen the kidnapper.
you told her that?
we needed her. - Can you give me a description?
you can't tell her I've seen the kidnapper when I didn't see the kidnapper.
I didn't see the kidnapper. - You didn't?
I saw...
through the kidnapper's eyes.
he was stalking his next victim. It was a woman.
talia! It's Talia.
wait, the woman you discovered the second note with is the third victim?
quite possibly.
or she could be the kidnapper.
so, what, she's kidnapping herself?
or the second victim is the kidnapper, and he was just pretending to get kidnapped.
guys, I just saw her. She's outside on the phone.
man...
where did you see her last? - Over there.
Aw, man...
"9-1-" uh-oh.
what? No note?
wait a minute.
excuse me.
thank you.
judgment day
looks like talia's joined Malone and Dent in missing persons land.
"judgment day"?
it sounds bad.
that's, like, the day that you're judged.
in The Terminator 2, it's the end of mankind, though I doubt our kidnapper has first-strike nuclear capabilities.
what the hell are you doing?
running makes me hungry. You know that.
you don't know where those have been. They could have bird flu on them or something.
bird flu. Wow.
look at you. How can you read a comic book at a time like this?
first of all, I can read a comic anytime.
secondly, Juliet has almost the entire police force inside there.
they'll find Talia and the others.
dude, whatever this crazy person has planned for these people, he's going to do it soon.
he has all his victims.
we need to figure out who stands to gain from the disappearance of those three, and who would want The Red Phantom movie to tank this badly.
why don't you ask your friend George Takei?
I would, but once he starts singing "afternoon delight,"
he just goes to another place. - Shawn?
Juliet didn't find anything at the latest crime scene to help?
Shawn - no forensics on the notes?
Shawn! - What?
look. It's the same as the note in Malone's room.
somebody's recreating the crime from this comic book.
what happens in this thing?
a supervillain named Fear Career, he kidnaps the judge, prosecutor, and defense attorney he felt locked him up years ago.
"fear Career." Awesome. Then what?
he sets them on fire.
he sets them on fire?
Yeah. - Give me that.
what the hell are you doing? - I'm looking for clues.
you're ruining a first printing, near-mint work of art.
I've been looking for that comic for five years now.
Gus, lives are at stake.
the kidnapper must be some kind of deranged fan.
deranged, yes.
fan, I'm not so sure.
what? What - what the
you're buying me another one. First printing.
she's not focusing.
can you help motivate her a little bit?
Yeah, yeah. Motivation was my thing at the academy.
all right, now, you listen to me!
it is time to squeeze this puppy out, so when I say push, I want you to push! You understand me?
push! Push! Push!
Yeah, that's not really working for me right now!
all right! Just giving it a shot!
okay. Okay, just...
just remain calm.
everything's going to be fine.
Yeah, I don't need that either.
I don't know what you want, then!
I don't know what any woman wants.
Oh, just give me your hand and shut the hell up.
it's crowning.
here we go.
here we go.
it's a girl!
you did it.
want to cut the cord, dad?
no, I'm not the
Yeah, okay.
Oh, you're going to
hi there.
nice to meet you.
children were one of the reasons my wife and I split up.
she didn't think I wanted any.
she was wrong.
Yeah, that's great, Carlton.
you think I might hold my baby now?
of course.
we need to find Juliet fast.
she's in plain clothes. She could be anywhere in this place.
it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I know how I can get her attention.
Shawn, will you stop going up there?
sorry. Judgment day. Got to do it.
ladies and gentlemen, George
o-okay. Okay.
please welcome back to the stage psychic Shawn Spencer!
I'm sensing something. Something strong.
a spirit. A disturbed spirit.
why is my assistant up there?
maybe he's setting up a karaoke machine for your duet, Chekov.
Sulu, damn it!
it's getting clearer now.
it's a kidnapping spirit, responsible for crimes committed right here at the con.
I need help.
I must call upon the powers...
of magichead!
Magichead!...
who's magichead?
Magichead!...
where are you going?
I can see it now!
it is a vengeful spirit, and there is a color. The color is green.
it is the green spirit!
the kidnapper is the creator of the green spirit...
Ah, yes, you had motive, didn't you?
the studio execs bastardized your beloved green spirit and turned him into a pop culture punchline.
you hated Malone, the malcontent, because it was his tidal wave of bad buzz that sunk your flick.
you were on the brink of becoming a mogul, but then it all slipped away.
now you're reduced to cursing nipples and signing autographs at conventions.
like a classic supervillain, you were driven mad by revenge.
you read Malone's blogs, looking for clues to his true identity.
then one day, like manna from heaven, the malcontent blogged he was coming here.
you also read the execs that screwed your character would be here, too.
all the people that wronged you in the same place at the same time
the opportunity was too good to pass up.
and you could hide your identity by wearing a costume.
and every time you snatched one of your victims, you left a note, just like Fear Career in your comic.
Yes, people, this was written by a criminal.
there is malice in the ink.
I can see it now.
Hiltz always had a very distinctive way of writing the letter "o."
it has...
a swoop.
I'm sure if the police analyze this autograph...
they'll see the handwriting is an exact match for the kidnapper's threatening notes.
this is the same thing that happened in San Antonio.
where are your victims?
my plan is already in motion and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
somebody's recreating the crime from this comic book.
what happens in this thing? - He sets them on fire.
they're near fire.
dent even organized this whole pyrotechnics display.
under the stage.
down here.
they're here.
all of them.
look, don't worry. Everything's going to be just fine, okay?
we're going to get you out of here. Guys...
Hi. - Hi!
so after I collared the villain, saved the girl, Jules grabbed the others, everyone hoisted me on their shoulders, carried me to the car, chanting my name.
it was awesome.
Oh, but your story about cutting the cord was good, too.
lot of drama, suspense...
twist ending that I don't think any of us saw coming.
at which point did you faint?
I did not faint.
I was merely resting my eyes momentarily and fell slightly backwards.
I don't know if it makes a difference...
I think you're a hero.
which one is hers? - I don't know.
Lassiter, you cut the cord.
well, they all look alike. Is there one that poops a lot?
I know. Let's ask our psychic.
you know, guys, this is weird. I'm not getting anything.
I think one of these babies might be evil, blocking my abilities to communicate.
come on, isn't it obvious?
she looks exactly like me.
chief, should you be up and walking?
walking? I'm coming in to work tomorrow.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
you need to go home with your child. Relax.
take a load off. Refresh yourself. January.
I think january. Come back in january.
so glad you both could make it.
make it"? I live here.
what's that behind you're back, Shawn?
I dropped back by the con. - You went back without me?
good people, good hearts. You were right from the beginning, Gus, and I didn't want to ruin the surprise.
introducing...
Tranya independent comics' latest limited edition one-shot...
surprise.
follow the adventures of psych-man as he uses his bizarre mental powers to foil criminal plots... with his sidekick magichead?
and...
bam.
what is that supposed to be?
dude, it's magichead.
it's like looking in a mirror.
why would I need a wand when I have a magic head?
it's, like... it's a ceremonial thing.
it's... it's just representative. You don't actually use the wand.
that's stupid.
I think it's dope.
now...
who wants an autograph?
dad, why do those people get better seats than us?
Shawn, those people aren't just watching the trial.
those people are the trial.
they're the jurors, and they are the most important people in this room.
they are?
the thing about the jury is, Shawn, you got to learn how to look at them, how to read them.
for instance, take a look at juror number five.
he's the guy in the front row, second one from the left.
tell me what you see.
go.
brown shirt. Little hole in his collar.
his coat is too tight on him.
he's got rough hands.
he's looking down, mostly, and nodding a lot.
good. Good.
let's take that hole in his collar.
now, would mom ever let you leave the house looking like that?
never.
you believe it.
so that tells us that he's probably not married.
that's called deductive reasoning.
your honor, the people call detective Henry L Spencer to the stand.
all right.
watch closely, kid.
one day, you're going to walk up the steps of this courthouse.
you're going to make your old man proud.
Gus, they impounded my motorcycle without warning.
at present
I'm pretty sure the warning was the $900 worth of parking tickets you racked up.
still, you can't take a man's means of transportation away.
it's unconstitutional or something.
I'm pretty sure it's not in the constitution.
Oh, don't be so sure.
I think it says, "thou shalt not something..."or covet something...
don't mess with texas or the right of transportation.
you're thinking of a commandment. - that's even better.
can we just pay this ticket so we can get out of here, please?
you've got to be kidding me.
we came all the way over here, and now you're not going to wait in the line?
Gus, did you see it in there?
hardly worth it.
Plus, I don't wait in lines.
what do you mean, you don't wait in lines?
everyone waits in lines.
that's all we do as people.
we wait in lines.
I don't. It's not in my nature.
that makes no sense, Shawn.
you remember the story of the scorpion and the frog.
they're both on the river bank-- Burton Guster.
the point is I shouldn't have gotten any tickets, Gus.
I was using my ambassador plates.
ambassador plates?
you're not an ambassador, Shawn.
impersonating a government official will land you in jail.
I am an ambassador...of sorts.
I am a goodwill ambassador...
to Paraguay.
to where? - Paraguay.
it is an honorary title that I received after overseeing all sand castle construction at a south american club Med.
you never worked at club Med.
Ooh, turn that up.
someone we know, someone we love, someone we invited into our living rooms...
I just saw that woman at the courthouse.
that's Sandra Panitch, the fourth grade teacher who murdered Jackson Hale.
don't you watch the news?
I can't watch channel 8 anymore.
Lloyd Lansing wears a toupee.
it's like every newscast starts with a lie.
I can't stand this guy.
something about him just irks me.
listen to him.
Sandra Panitch went with weatherman Jackson Hale to his channel 8 news studio, engaged in sexual relations with him, and then stabbed him in the heart with a letter opener.
she fled the scene, but not without leaving behind a mountain of physical evidence, including a trail of the victim's blood and her fingerprints all over the murder weapon.
this is why the state is going after murder one.
but she didn't do it. - what?
I'm getting a very strong feeling here.
I think that woman is innocent.
I do watch the news, and following this case.
they have a mountain of evidence against this lady.
look, they call her the "school marm murderer.
first of all, there's a question mark at the end of that.
they call her the "school marm murderer?
even the newspeople aren't convinced.
and today, at the courthouse, in the middle of a conversation,
I saw her bend over and pick up a piece of trash.
Oh, I see, so because she picks up somebody's kit kat wrapper means she didn't kill anybody?
that makes sense.
she didn't have to do that.
the woman is about to be on trial for her life.
she takes time out for common courtesy?
that is not the mindset of a cold-blooded murderer.
no.
this is what I know.
she looked at me right in the eyes.
now...
there are a lot of tells that people have when they are trying to appear not guilty.
the way that they sit, crossing their legs, uncrossing them, crossing them back, eye lines to inanimate objects, twitching, itching, rubbing.
all of these affectations...
I am an expert on all of them, but there's one thing that you cannot change, no matter how hard you try, and that is the tint on the windows to the soul.
Adam Hornstock, attorney for the defense.
Sandra Panitch is a victim of circumstance...
of being in the wrong place at the wrong time...
Oh, no. Look at this poor guy.
look. He's hunched over. He's not making eye contact.
and look at the handkerchief in the left pocket there.
it's not decorative, Gus. That's crumpled and stained.
that's used for dabbing sweat...
a lot.
her lawyer's a beaten man.
whether he knows it or not, adam Hornstock...
needs us.
what are you talking about?
dude, we're going to be legal consultants.
it's awesome.
let's get in there and grab seats.
do you think that court officer is guarding the door for his health?
just roll with me on this.
excuse me, people. Coming through.
Shawn Spencer here.
this is my partner, Burton Guster.
look, I know I have been reluctant to go on record about this trial up to this point.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
what is this, journalism 101?
I give my statement. You berate me with your rudimentary Q & A later.
in fact, you two, switch places.
Yeah. Excuse me.
come on. Don't be shy.
he puts his pants on one leg at a time.
as I was saying, this trial is not about a particular case.
it is about our rights as citizens.
no one, and i mean no one, should ever wake up, and...
I don't know. Let's say...
find that their motorcycle has been taken away from them.
as this trial moves forward, I will have more to say.
that is all. Thank you.
motorcycle? Whose motorcycle are we talking about here?
did the defendant ride a motorcycle?
guys, please, please.
give them their space.
are we ready yet, Mr. Hornstock?
Oh, yes.
just one moment, sir.
you know, I was pre-law once.
maybe I should've stuck with it.
you were never pre-law.
well, I was pre-pre-law.
sixth grade, but...
it was an accelerated program.
I won a mock trial of Tortoise vs. Hare.
the hare did it. - Of course he did.
the court will take a short recess, and then, perhaps, Mr. Hornstock, we can get going with these proceedings.
dude, we're so hired.
we are?
watch this.
excuse me. Mr. Hornstock, right?
you don't know me. My name's Shawn Spencer.
I'm the lead psychic detective at the sbpd.
uh, yeah, um, I'm a little busy.
I can see. You're doing a bang-up job.
please don't stop. I just...
I think maybe you should be a little careful.
Oh? - Of juror number four.
juror...
Oh, yeah? Why is that?
something about you really bothers her.
I think something about her bothers me.
she's been frowning at me the whole time.
I haven't even gone up yet.
here's the thing-- she's a fashion maven.
she has a problem with your appearance, until you change it,
I don't think she's going to listen to a word you say.
my appearance?
the manner in which you appear. Your "look."
I don't know exactly what the problem is, but let's check it out.
give me the 360 cat dance real fast, huh?
excuse me? - twirl it up for me, and then twirl it right back.
there it is. And back. Suit. Pleated.
I would've gone with a three-button, maybe something in a wool-cotton blend, but I don't think that's the problem.
sideburns, check.
hair, bold. Strokes, hives...
I don't think that's the problem.
the shoes, not a spit shine, but you haven't gotten up yet, so I can't make heads or-- whoa...
whoa, whoa, whoa.
I think it's the tie.
what? My tie? What's wrong with my tie?
well, it's a little bit...
well, look, it's not, like, my favorite tie.
I'm so glad to hear you say that.
quick, give me your tie.
I'm not giving you my tie. It's a good tie.
give me the tie, please.
it's a Thomas Pink tie.
one sec.
why won't you give me the tie?
look high, reach low.
got it.
we're also going to take this, primarily because it's covered in sweat, but also because it reads "cruise ship waiter" to me.
cruise ship?
go get 'em.
and so I will demonstrate to the court that Sandra Panitch is an upstanding citizen with no criminal record...
and the district attorney has rushed to the prosecution of an innocent woman.
are you finished now, mr. Hornstock?
Oh, yes. Yes, your honor.
brilliant.
well, things are finally moving along.
court will recesses till after lunch.
did you see that?
that was amazing. Did you see that?
that was a whole 180.
it's a pretty amazing tie.
Hey, strong shag, strong tie...
strong person.
uh, you know, guys, I would hire you in a second.
it's just...
well, i...I don't have the authorization.
my firm doesn't really believe in...
winning?
no.
mermaids?
no. - the minotaur.
no. Me.
Yeah, uh...
at least, not anymore.
no, there's no "buts" here.
a lot of the cases my partner Gus and I take we do for free.
it's called "pro bono."
Gus. - what?
Congratulations.
you've got yourself a couple of legal consultants.
Oh, boy.
did he just grab your fist?
and then he shook it.
what do we have here?
Jules。 Hi, Jules.
please tell me you're not one of those courtroom groupies that bounces from trial to trial...
wait a second.
that's actually really funny, Shawn.
detective Lassiter is the one who actually made the arrest of Sandra Panitch.
see, that makes it my case.
what a coincidence.
it's also our case.
Yeah, we just signed on as legal consultants to the defense.
just now.
you will sell your little sides how act to anyone who will listen.
just don't screw this one up.
don't screw this up?
Hey, Lassie, that really wasn't much of a putdown.
in fact, it was...
somewhat inspiring.
let's roll that back!
I don't know.
it feels a little weird.
I mean, you should really be sitting here.
this is your office.
uh, yeah, this isn't my office.
you didn't like my mine.
this is Carter Jarecki's office, one of the partners.
actually, he's the guy who took the case in the first place, but then dumped it on me when he decided it was a lost cause.
you see, that's exactly what I'm talking about why didn't you stand up to that guy?
for the worst reason possible.
I actually believe this woman is innocent.
now, can we please go before JareckI gets back?
Carter Jarecki just left for a nooner with his mistress.
we have at least two hours.
maybe an hour and a half.
Hornstock, I think you have the potential to be a fantastic lawyer.
you just need confidence.
after all, that's your name on the door.
now, come on.
Oh, no.
no, none of those Hornstocks are me.
the first one is my grandfather.
he founded the firm.
the middle one is my father, then my brother.
a whole family of lawyers?
Yeah, even my sister.
well, there you go. She didn't make the door.
she's Biederman.
it's her married name.
well, we're going to need to take a look at your witness lists and your deposition transcripts.
Oh, yeah, well, i've prepared all that for you.
I have, uh...
here are all the forensic and arrest reports, and I deposed several of hale's co-workers from channel 8, mostly to refute timelines and for character testimony.
can we see those?
sure, yeah. Here's...
Oh, yes, and maybe later on we can read the phone book just for fun.
I have got to do what I do.
that's not the way I do it.
I need to see, feel, and smell people in order to figure out what happened.
smell them?
so this is where the, uh...
the crime took place.
so just feel free to have a look around, so do...
whatever it is you do.
thank you.
let's walk the crime, shall we?
Yeah.
probably came in from that same entrance we did.
found their way over here to the channel 8 anchor desk area.
of course, the body was found...
here.
it was a short walk.
Yeah.
Priscilla, what are these green walls for?
Oh, well, we do it all in green screen.
can you show me how that works, please?
sure. I just need someone to sit in front.
Gus, go sit over there.
I'm not going to sit there just because you tell me to.
fine. I'll play anchorman.
I got it. I got it.
okay, so we just have to go to the control room.
it's just this way.
okay.
you know when we're watching the weather guy and it looks like he's got, like, rainfall behind him, or snow or hail?
how does that work?
well, the green background works as a blank slate.
then I just run it through the board, and presto.
a composite of the two images is made.
Oh, oh, oh. Can we get sound in here?
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
in local news, a pharmaceutical representative again provided the key piece of information in a baffling police case...
but ran screaming from the scene like a little girl before he could make a statement.
that was one time! One time!
I don't like dead bodies. I told you that.
now, stop bringing that up.
hello.
this is your local news.
this next office was Jackson Hale's.
I got to tell you guys, everybody's been acting a little weird since it happened.
it's just not the same.
Oh...
this is Shawn Spencer and Burton Guster.
they're working on Jackson Hale's case.
this is ruben leonard. He's a lab meteorologist on Jackson's team.
was.
I was just...
sorting and packing some of his more important things to send to his family.
it's the least I can do.
that's very thoughtful.
thank you. - it reminds me of a hot little senorita i met there.
she was serving fried jalapenos-- - excuse me.
sure. Sure, sure.
so, if you'll notice that we've got...
did you work with Jackson Hale long?
six years.
he was a great man.
I had a lot of respect for him.
he was just so good at what he did.
because I guarantee it's raining cats and dogs...
a broadcasting treasure.
dude...
Ruben's in there destroying hale's awards.
what? - yeah.
unless he's really offended by the shoddy engraving on the plaque, that guy hates Jackson Hale.
I'm not saying he did it, but...
reasonable doubt, anyone?
okay, Ms. Panitch.
please, walk us through the night of the crime.
I never met mr. Hale before that night.
I just moved here from Wisconsin.
it wasn't like I was a fan of his.
I only vaguely knew he was a weatherman.
so we talked, and he was charming...
so the scratches on Jackson Hale's back,
and his skin under your fingernails, this all happened during the sex.
as well as the bruises on your arm?
it got passionate.
I don't remember anything until I woke up the next morning.
with his blood on you?
and then you fled to the parking lot?
look, I was scared.
I know how bad all of this looks, I do, but I swear I did not murder anyone.
do you guys believe me?
do you? - of course we do, Sandra.
don't be ridiculous.
counselor. - yes.
would you please retire with me to the hallway where we can exchange words in hushed tones?
okay, what are you doing?
what?
you are supposed to be demonstrating confidence and swagger for Hornstock.
instead, you're poking holes in our case and you're scaring our defendant.
here are the facts, Shawn.
all we know about Sandra is what she has told us.
I think we need to do some investigating.
I believe her.
Hornstock believes her. What else do we need?
we need proof, Shawn.
look, right here in this book, Corey V. Bolevicker in 1955.
the key piece of evidence was half-melted candlesticks.
we need evidence.
where are our candlesticks, Shawn?
maybe you just jumped over them.
what? - be nimble? Be quick?
you're not going to give me anything?
now, can we please
check out the judge.
he's grabbing his back. No wonder he's so grumpy.
he's not grabbing his back. He's grabbing his kidneys.
he probably has a kidney stone.
dude, nice.
thank you.
please state to the court what your relationship with mr. Hale was.
it was professional. He was my boss.
I was his receptionist.
and as the channel 8 receptionist, Ms. Osterman, if people were to call Jackson Hale, you took those calls?
I did.
and did you receive any calls from the defendant, Sandra Panitch, at any time?
Oh, not to my knowledge, no.
but other women would call?
sure.
was Jackson Hale sleeping with these women?
objection, your honor.
hearsay.
I'll allow the question.
well, I can only say that I fielded many calls, and sometimes I helped to juggle these calls.
he was a handsome man.
he certainly was.
thank you, Ms. Osterman.
you may step down, ms. Osterman.
Thanks.
your honor, the state requests a moment to prepare for our next witness.
he certainly was"?
what happened? You were rolling.
I don't know. I don't know.
it sounded good in my head.
you have a great support system.
it gives you that easy confidence.
but my father hasn't been to court once, not one of my trials.
you've been here one day, your father's already here.
what are you talking about?
no, i met him outside.
he's a really nice guy.
your honor...the defense would like to call for a recess.
excuse me.
who are you?
I'm sorry, your honor. My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm a psychic legal consultant on this case-- - Objection, your honor.
we were not made aware that a psychic was hired on this case.
approach the bench. All of you.
it's okay.
your honor, the people question his validity.
okay, first of all, that's hurtful.
look, I know you're the big, bad prosecutor with the sweet head, but is this tone really necessary?
no.
I am a legitimate consultant.
I have been hired often by the santa barbara police department, and there is a high-ranking detective in this very courtroom right now who will vouch for my validity.
who is this?
he's right there.
the wispy yet commanding irish fellow who looks like he's been sucking on sour patch kids.
would you stand and state your name for the court?
Carlton Lassiter, Santa Barbara police department, your honor.
head detective, 11 years...
this may.
perhaps you'd like to inform the court of your favorite color as well.
the point is do you know this man?
I do.
and has he worked on cases for the department?
he has.
there you have it.
and he was helpful?
Absolutely.
did he just say "absolutely" with a little half-smile?
I'd like that printed out, please
I'm thinking of shellacking it on a nice piece of maple, maybe doing a little decoupage.
your honor, as you can see, I'm responsible for breaking...
many cases here in the state of california.
well, guess what-- I don't care who you are or what you've done for the state.
I don't believe in that psychic mumbo-jumbo, and it's not welcome in my court.
Mumbo-jumbo?
Oh, you poor, poor man.
no wonder. You're...
passing a kidney stone can be very stressful.
who told you that? I never told anyone.
you tell me if I'm overstepping my bounds, but i'd like to suggest an old home remedy that did wonders for my aunt delores.
you simply gargle with some mineral water, followed up with some raw greens.
me, personally, i'd go with asparaGus tips.
that way, later on...
when you're making water, you'll know that it's working.
let's proceed with the trial.
okay, you got me. I'm startled.
what are you doing here?
maybe we're both psychics.
I am serious.
occasionally I come down here, I sit in on a trial.
today, I get a phone call.
guess who's practicing law now?
wait a minute. You come down here? Regularly?
Thursdays, usually.
today was just a bonus.
my god.
you just can't let go, can you?
you retired too early.
not my fault.
I didn't ask you to turn in your badge
Shawn-- - I'm trying to do something
you seem to forget whose name you got at the end of your letterhead, kid.
when you use my name, it is my business as well.
give me my phone.
took you long enough to figure out the kidney stone.
let it be noted that the witness identified the defendant, Sandra Panitch, as the woman he saw running through the parking lot on the night of the murder.
has it been authenticated?
Hey, what would Phelps need to get authenticated?
I don't know.
his little collection of green army men?
Hornstock, did you just make a joke?
I think you did.
your witness. Does the defense wish to cross-examine?
your honor, the defense rests.
No! It doesn't.
your honor...the defense may rest.
why am I not resting?
I have a vibe that's very strong.
hatred, jealousy...
that guy wanted to be a serious weatherman.
he has no sympathy for Jackson Hale whatsoever.
what, you think he did it?
no, I'm pretty sure he didn't.
but we can plant a seed.
Johnny applestock...
your honor, the defense does not rest.
Mr. Leonard, you are a meteorologist, are you not?
Yes, i am indeed.
but not on the air.
no, not on the air.
maybe because you don't have a meteorologist's name.
I don't follow.
correct me if I'm wrong, but "leonard" isn't a term for any kind of weather.
no, it is not.
so, if I was to look up "leonard" in, say, a weather glossary, there would be no definition.
no, there would not.
excuse me...where is this going?
Yes, Mr. Hornstock, where are you going with this?
I'm sorry, your honor.
it's just that every successful weatherman that I know of has a real weatherman's name.
Johnny mountain...
dallas raines...
Oh, Jackson Hale, for example.
okay, first of all, that wasn't even his real name.
Precisely!
have you ever considered going by the name of Bolt Lightning?
no.
cloudy Mcmillan? - No.
Wendy Morningdew?
that's a woman's name.
okay, look, I have a degree in meteorology from the university of virginia.
I wrote my thesis on bernoulli's theorem of incompressible level flow, and...
I was a junior tornado safety captain for seven years.
jackson Hale has a degree in what?
physical education from a junior college.
he was an embarrassment.
he was worthless, all right?
he was worthless to anyone who is a real meteorologist, like myself.
he should've been stabbed in the heart long ago!
objection, your honor!
it's a little late for that, don't you think, counselor?
that's the kind of confidence I'm talking about.
that's what I'm talking about.
we are on our way to winning this thing.
told you.
she's kind and she's innocent.
just because we had a small victory in court yesterday doesn't mean we're out of the woods.
son of a bitch.
alligator pumps.
I should arrest that weatherman.
he clearly stated it was not going to rain today.
you see, that's the problem with what I like to call "group thinking.
we don't listen to group thinkers.
Nope. In fact...we don't listen to weathermen at all.
if you'll excuse me, i've really got better things to do.
dinner with your cat?
ohara, you coming?
you go. I'll catch up with you.
you know, Shawn, for a psychic, you are missing something right in front of your face.
it's too bad.
you might actually learn something about Lassiter.
maybe you don't want to.
he waxes his back?
I'm going to go now, and Shawn, I don't care what anyone else says.
the pink shirt is working.
okay, that was cryptic.
not really. I'll be damned.
who's "detective assi"?
it's Lassiter.
he must've sent some sort of memo to Phelps.
the question is why would Lassiter send a letter to the D. A.'s office?
don't you ever watch Law and Order?
they tend to work together sometimes.
right. So...
so go ahead and check the files, and find me that letter.
phelps received it on the 7th.
I've been through all of them.
there are no memos filed on the 7th.
so it didn't get filed...
but there is a memo.
so whatever's on that memo is clearly worth hiding.
and she told you this directly?
Yes.
when i questioned the defendant, she admitted to having sexual relations with the victim.
but not to stabbing him with a letter opener?
well, she appeared at the time to be confused, and had memory gaps, but she claimed never to have seen or touched the weapon.
even though her fingerprints were all over it.
I see.
thank you, detective Lassiter.
nothing further.
your witness.
you sure about this?
Yes, I have a very strong feeling about this letter.
first rule of trial law
never ask a question you don't know the answer to.
Hey, have I steered you wrong yet?
come on.
detective Lassiter...
did you send a letter to the D.A.'s office on the 7th of August?
Yes, I did.
and what did it say?
objection.
lack of foundation.
I'll allow it. Go ahead. Tell the jury what it said.
it questioned the defendant's motive.
that it was very strong, you mean?
no, it questioned whether I believed the defendant had one at all.
the prosecution never submitted this letter into evidence, so at this point, your honor, the defense calls for a mistrial.
approach the bench.
we may have received the letter.
I-I can't be sure.
we didn't knowingly withhold it.
my office is wall-to-wall papers.
then go to staples and buy yourself some new file folders, but until then, you are warned.
any new evidence must be submitted to all parties immediately.
do i make myself clear?
Yes, your honor...
and in the spirit of that ruling,
I would like to submit a new piece of evidence.
if this is that willy-nilly piece of evidence that you tried to get in in pre-trial,
I'll tell you one more time
I will not admit any audio/visual evidence unless it's been authenticated.
has it been authenticated?
we just got our authentication papers from the lab in sacramento.
it is a videotape of the defendant, Sandra Panitch, murdering the victim, Jackson Hale.
stop saying "bingoI don't judge, I argue that this tape should not be admissible.
on what grounds?
well, we're citing...
unfair surprisery.
I still don't understand why he is in this room.
he is nothing but a disruption.
maybe someday, Phelps, when you're a judge, which I highly doubt will happen, then you can decide who's welcome in your chambers.
your honor, these guys are a part of my team, and I want them here.
Why?
you used to be a good lawyer, Hornstock, but let's face it, if you've got to resort to hiring this idiot psychic and his little sidekick.
I'm nobody's sidekick, you pompous ass-- - Gus, Gus.
what? Come on. Look at you.
we are all grown men here.
let's just take a beat.
let's...Let's take a step back.
let's take a step back.
Mr. Hornstock, having now seen the video in question,
I don't think I need to tell you how damaging it is.
I strongly suggest at this point that you consider accepting a plea bargain for murder two.
your honor, I will have to review the tape and confer with my client.
I'll tell you what, Hornstock.
I will leave murder two on the table until tomorrow morning.
consider that my gift to you.
she doesn't realize she's being taped.
Nope.
I don't think this is his first barbecue either, if you know what i mean.
this high-def plasma really makes a difference.
I can see the beads of sweat on his neck.
look at his hair. - that's horrible.
do any of you make noises like that?
his or hers?
when she sees this, she will certainly take the deal.
I'm not going to take the deal.
if you don't take the deal, you could go away, possibly for life.
you do realize this?
I don't care.
I'm not going to admit to something that I didn't do.
okay, I believe you, I believe you, but I watched that tape, and as your attorney, i am begging you...
take the deal.
don't take the deal.
what are you doing?
you're supposed to be on my side.
Hornstock, i am on your side.
I mean, not technically, because of the shape of this table.
imagine a round table.
I would've sat somewhere in the middle.
okay, tomorrow morning, when the jury watches this tape, we will lose this case.
this tape is not telling us the whole truth.
there's more.
I need to take this tape.
you just work on your closing arguments.
you leave the rest to me.
quit pacing, Shawn. You're making me nervous.
I can't afford it, dad.
I can't afford a guilty verdict on my record right now.
I can't.
you do realize that you're not a real lawyer, right?
you don't have a record.
it's so weird. The prosecution keeps treating this case like a crime of passion, right?
but she only knew him for a couple of hours.
I ask you, how much passion can you muster up for someone in a couple of hours?
Yeah, well, crimes of passion are rarely about love or sex, Shawn.
they're closer to revenge, sometimes hatred.
I would say that your angry meteorologist is the best suspect you've got going.
he didn't do it.
Yeah, I know that, Shawn.
the point is you need to find somebody who felt like that.
Oh, dad, believe me, there are plenty.
the guy slept with half of Santa Barbara.
we can put them all on the stand.
the problem is that Sandra is the only one that was there.
you have a whisk.
I do, and you're not looking close enough.
well, you know what?
it's tough when virtually everything imaginable is stacked against me.
I've got your ass staring me down in the courtroom,
I've got a defense attorney who breaks every time the wind blows,
I've got to hitch rides every time I need to go somewhere, because, get this, there's some rogue meter maid who's decided to have a ticketing vendetta against me and my motorcycle.
well, Shawn, maybe that might not happen if you didn't park your bike 14 feet from a fire hydrant outside your apartment.
dad, you've seen my street.
the parking is a joke
how did you know that?
how do you know that? Wait a second.
how-- how did you know that?
look who's paying attention now.
you tipped them off?
you tipped them off about my bike?
who taught you how to drive, Shawn?
who do you represent every time you're out on that road?
I don't represent anybody when I go out on the road!
dad, they took my bike!
tell it to the embassy.
I might not be able to get it out of the impound.
Yeah, well, then maybe it's time for you to consider a real mode of transportation, huh?
you will do anything you can to impose your will on me.
you hated that bike.
you have always hated that bike, and you've been especially hard-ass about it since I
since you what, Shawn?
since you what? Since you had your accident?
is that it? Is that where your old man crossed the line?
fine. I'll tell you what-- I will back off.
I'm going to lay off, man.
I'll tell you what you do.
you take me off your call list the next time the ambulance picks you up and brings you in that door. All right?
fair.
get over yourself, kid.
or at least learn how to park.
Shawn, what are you doing?
do you know what time it is?
what?
what time-- what time is it?
it's 9: 00.
we're late for court. I called you a million times.
Gus... - what?
would you say anger is a good motivator?
did you see your dad again?
Yes, I did...
and I think it actually worked.
Mr. Hornstock?
your honor, the defense has nothing more.
not so fast.
excuse me?
call Priscilla Osterman to the stand.
what are you talking about?
she already testified.
can we recall her?
Yes, if we have new information, but I have nothing else to ask her.
Oh, trust me. I am feeling all kinds of good stuff here.
your honor...
the defense calls ms. Osterman back to the stand.
objection.
overruled.
I'm giving you the teeniest latitude, providing you have some new evidence to mine here.
ms. Osterman, I remind you that you are still under oath.
proceed, counselor.
ask her if she is absolutely certain that she did not sleep with Jackson Hale.
ms. Osterman, are you absolutely certain you did not sleep with Jackson Hale?
objection, your honor.
asked and answered in prior testimony.
sustained. I'm not kidding, counselor.
I'm giving you one more question, and then I'm shutting you down.
did you want to?
objection.
this man is not a lawyer.
he has no right to address the witness.
actually, your honor, he can, under rule 775a of the california state rules of evidence.
the rule gives the court wide discretion over the mode and order of presenting evidence, effective for the ascertainment of the truth.
precedence, Killmer V. Duchscherer.
I mean, we are trying to ascertain the truth here, aren't we?
that is absolutely correct, young man.
where did you attend law school?
just sixth grade law, your honor, but it was an accelerated program.
it is up to my discretion to allow any testimony that may speak to the truth of this case.
proceed, Mr. Spencer, with caution.
thank you, your honor.
all right.
just warming her up for you, buddy.
Yeah. Go.
Hi, Priscilla.
everybody here is absolutely certain you didn't sleep with Jackson Hale, but Jackson Hale slept with...
everybody...
except for you.
isn't that right?
you couldn't take it, could you?
him walking by every single day and never noticing you.
not once.
repeatedly choosing to sleep with women like the defendant,
well, that's...that's not...that's not true.
that video will show Jackson Hale being murdered, but not by Sandra Panitch.
by you.
objection, your honor.
I mean...this is...it's ridiculous.
I feel the tape is the proof!
the tape is the pudding!
your honor, I said objection.
I demand you get him to stop that.
sit down.
do you need a tutorial in rule 775?
Mr. Riggs...
can you please play the tape again?
thank you.
could you take it back a little bit?
and forward. I'm sorry. It was forward.
and back. Just forward.
right there.
right there.
right here.
that.
that right there.
it's a cloud.
not a cloud.
a shadow. A shadow...
of a human person.
you were wearing those glasses that night, making it unmistakable that you were there.
that...
is your shadow, Priscilla.
you watched.
you waited.
waited for them to drop out of frame, then bam, on the head to Sandra, and...
into the heart of Jackson.
you didn't think there was any way you could be blamed...
because clouds don't kill people.
people kill people.
but this was a crime of passion.
but not because he loved you...
but because he didn't.
he walked by me in the hallway every day like I didn't exist.
like I was invisible.
and so you proved him right by being invisible on that tape.
we would have been the most amazing couple.
he just refused to see it.
he just broke my heart over and over and over again, so i just broke his!
by stabbing it with a letter opener!
Yes, yes! I killed him!
holy crap.
did you just hear that?
we heard that, yes.
sorry, your honor.
usually when I do this, when things come to me psychically,
I got to jump through all these hoops.
I got to find interim chief Vick, run stuff by Lassie there, sign a bunch of papers..."t"s, "i"s, the whole bit.
seems like we got everything we need here.
you, the jury, the stenographer, mr. Riggs.
I move to release the defendant immediately and take the witness into custody for processing.
bailiff.
case dismissed.
you mean to tell me our whole lives you've never been to a single auction?
Nope. Dude, watch this. It's very fun.
how is it fun?
you're bidding against the public for your own motorcycle.
what happens if somebody outbids you?
I've been practicing my paddle raise.
it's very subtle. Where is this thing?
you know, plus, now that Carter Jarecki's wife has hired us to consult on her divorce, we're flush. I can go as high as I need to go.
okay.
dad?
what are you doing here?
I came for the auction.
was there a boating incident I didn't hear about?
a little tuna boat get impounded?
you know, actually, Shawn, no.
I felt bad about those tickets, so I'm here to get your bike for you.
get out of here.
Hey, Shawn, Gus!
what's up? Hey! Hey!
legal eagles!
I thought i might see you here.
Oh, you know...
the name partners were very impressed, and they're anxious to hire you guys again, especially this new guy.
what's his name?
Oh, it's me.
Hey.
Congratulations.
you got the bump!
thank you. We'd love to work with you.
so, what is it now? Hornstock, Hornstock, Hornstock, Biederman, and Hornstock?
we had to get wider doors, but yes.
Hey, I didn't get to thank you properly, so, uh, you know,
I'm here for the auction.
I'm going to put some money down on that bike, get it back for you.
Hey, guys, really, I do...
I appreciate it-- It's very sweet.
but I can stand on my own two feet and get my own bike back.
I believe this is yours.
they just pulled it from the auction.
pulled from the auction?
I was...i've been practicing my paddle raise.
it's a subtle move.
what does that mean, "internally"?
what does that mean, "internally"?
what does that mean, "internally"?
I don't know.They just gave me the paperwork.
what are you looking at?
go home.
you ONLY GOT A MINUTE. I KNOW.
60 SECONDS. I KNOW.
what IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE DEAD?
you TOUCH MURDER VICTIMS, YOU ASK WHO KILLED THEM.
you TOUCH THEM AGAIN, THEY GO BACK TO BEING DEAD,
and YOU COLLECT THE REWARD? NOBODY CAN KNOW.
I CAN'T EVEN HUG YOU? YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME.
so A KISS IS OUT OF THE QUESTION?
who's THE FUNNY GIRL STUCK TO NED? CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART.
he DIGS HER IN A WAY HE DEFINITELY DOESN'T DIG YOU.
CHUCK: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME BACK TO LIFE.
people AREN'T USED TO THIS SORT OF THING.
issues OF MORALITY, HOW COME SHE'S NOT DEAD ANYMORE?
you UNDERSTAND YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR AUNTS.
it'd BE A DISASTER.
this PIE SMELLS DELICIOUS.
we RECENTLY LOST OUR NIECE.
your NIECE, CHARLOTTE CHARLES, IS DEAD?
presently?
narrator: AT THIS VERY MOMENT, IN THE TOWN OF NORTH THRUSH,
young NED WAS...
lonely.
unable TO MAKE FRIENDS AT THE LONGBURROW SCHOOL FOR BOYS,
he OFTEN FOUND HIMSELF PLAYING ALONE,
with NOTHING BUT MEMORIES OF HAPPIER TIMES
to KEEP HIS COMPANY.
what YOUNG NED DID NOT REALIZE WAS THAT,
beyond THE MEADOW AND UNDER THE SAME ORANGE SKY,
someone HE LOVED WAS REMEMBERING HIM.
his DOG, DIGBY.
in FACT, THREE DAYS PRIOR, DIGBY HAD MADE A DECISION.
wearied BY HIS OWN LONELINESS BACK IN COEUR d'COEURS
and SENSINHIS MASTER'S SORROW, DIGBY SET OUT ON A MISSION.
uncertain AS TO HIS EXACT DESTINATION,
he VENTURED INTO THE GREAT UNKNOWN,
guided ONLY BY THE COMPASS OF HIS HEART.
narrator: DESPITE NUMEROUS DISTRACTIONS, [ SIREN WAILING ] DIGBY WAS DETERMINED TO FIND YOUNG NED,
the BOY WHO HAD GIVEN HIM A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE...
and WHO WAS HIS BEST FRIEND.
upon DOING SO, DIGBY PROVED THAT LOVE CAN OVERCOME ANY OBSTACLE.
the REUNION WAS BITTERSWEET, HOWEVER,
as THEY INSTANTLY REMEMBERED THE RESTRICTIONS OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP.
they COULD NOT TOUCH, OR DIGBY WOULD DIE.
still, IT WAS ENOUGH.
narrator: THAT DAY, DIGBY VOWED HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN ALLOW HIMSELF
to BE SEPARATED FROM HIS MASTER.
the PIE MAKER DID NOT WISH TO BE SEPARATED FROM CHUCK,
who, IN TURN, DID NOT WISH TO BE SEPARATED FROM HER AUNTS,
Lily AND VIVIAN,
who CONTINUED TO BE CHALLENGED BY SOCIAL PHOBIAS.
unbeknownst TO THE PIE MAKER,
Chuck SECRETLY BAKED HOMEOPATHIC MOOD ENHANCERS INTO PIES FOR HER AUNTS,
hoping THAT A SLICE A DAY
Oh, YOU'RE UP EARLY.
um -- OH, I COULDN'T SLEEP.
lumpy MATTRESS? LUMPY DREAMS.
which ARE A LOT MORE VIVID NOW THAN THEY WERE BEFORE I DIED.
isn't THAT INTERESTING?
just ONE OF THOSE... LITTLE THINGS.
what ARE THOSE?
Oh, I, UH...
got BIT.
those ARE BEESTINGS.
how'd YOU GET STUNG BY SO MANY BEES?
and WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BEES THAT STUNG YOU?
that's A SUICIDE ATTACK.
not IN THIS CASE.
they, UH, SORT OF STUNG ME, DIED,
then THEY FLEW AWAY AGAIN, AND SOME OTHER BEES DIED.
do YOU THINK THEIR HONEY TASTES DIFFERENT 'CAUSE THEY DIED?
wouldn't THAT BE INTERESTING?
just ONE OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
bees!
your BEES.
my BEES? YOU MEAN...
no, NOT THOSE BEES -- NEW BEES.
technically, STILL YOUR BEES,
just...not THE BEES THAT YOU KNEW.
but I'M SURE THEY'RE EQUALLY NICE.
you DO REALIZE THAT BEEKEEPING WITHIN CITY LIMITS
is COMPLETELY ILLEGAL. YES.
and I'M ALMOST SURE I DON'T CARE.
well, I CAN NOT CARE ENOUGH FOR THE BOTH OF US.
we CAN PLANT WILD FLOWERS ON ROOFTOPS
and BE UNORTHODOX URBAN HONEY PIONEERS.
[ Chuckles ] THANK YOU.
thank YOU. THANK YOU.
if I COULD HUG YOU RIGHT NOW -- I KNOW THAT I CAN'T, BUT
[ sighs ] JUST KNOW THAT I WANT TO.
I DO.
narrator: AS CHUCK CONSIDERED HER FUTURE
as AN UNORTHODOX URBAN HONEY PIONEER...
olive SNOOK CONSIDERED HOW THE MAN SHE LOVED
seemed TO BE IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
narrator: HER AFFECTION FO THE PIE MAKER HAD NOT WAVERED,
despite THE ROMANTIC THREAT OF A DEAD GIRL WHO WASN'T DEAD.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT.
narrator: ON THE CONTRARY,
olive's RESOLVE HAD ONLY INCREASED
since THE REALIZATION THAT CHUCK, INDEED,
was SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.
good MORNING! OLIVE ASSUMED CHUCK HAD FAKED HER OWN DEATH.
she WOULD KEEP THE SECRET FOR NOW,
as CHUCK KEPT HER SECRET FROM THE PIE MAKER.
there's A PIE IN MY OVEN.
Oh, UH, THAT'S MINE. I WAS PRACTICING.
it SMELLS LIKE CHEESE. IS IT QUICHE?
I BAKED MONASTERY GOUDA INTO THE CRU
tart APPLE FILLING.
I THOUGHT I'D TRY IT.
Olive: YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE DELICIOUS?
Yeah, IT WOULD.
narrator: UNBEKNOWNST TO CHUCK,
olive UNDERSTOOD THE DELICIOUSNESS
thank YOU.
narrator: ...BECAUSE SHE SECRETLY DELIVERED
that FIRST MOOD-ENHANCING PIE TO AUNTS LILY AND VIVIAN,
as SHE WOULD DELIVER THIS ONE...
narrator: ...BUT NOT BEFORE A COLLISION OCCURRED.
Oh! I THINK SHE'S DEAD!
can YOU FEEL A HEARTBEAT? I DON'T...D-DO HEARTBEATS.
well, THEY FEEL LIKE THIS. COME HERE.
is THAT A DEAD BIRD?
why ARE YOU TOUCHING A DEAD BIRD?
throw THAT AWAY.
it's SWIMMING WITH DISEASE, AND YOU SERVE FOOD.
don't BE SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN.
besides, IT DOESN'T LOOK DISEASED.
it's DEAD, AND IT'S A BIRD. IT'S DISEASED.
it's A MIRACLE BIRD!
it's SWIMMING IN MIRACLES, NOT DISEASE!
maybe I SHOULD HOLD IT.
Oh, NO, REALLY, DO YOU HAVE TO?
she's OBVIOUSLY BEEN THROUGH A LOT,
and SHE SEEMS REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE.
narrator: HAVING BROUGHT A DEAD THING BACK TO LIFE,
the PIE MAKER FRETTED OVER WHO, OR WHAT, WOULD PAY
for THAT LIFE WITH ITS OWN.
I WONDER HOW SHE LOST HER WING.
doesn't SEEM TO BE IN ANY PAIN.
she's PROBABLY NOT IN PAIN.
but WHAT DO I KNOW? I'M NOT A BIRD.
pigeon. PIGEON.
uh, PIGEON-TOED AS A CHILD,
but ORTHOPEDIC SHOES SOLVED THAT.
[ chuckling ] YEAH.
what IS THE RATE OF EXCHANGE ON THE LIFE OF A BIRD?
cause IF IT'S EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN MINE,
I NEED TO GET BACK TO MY CAR.
I'm MORE CONCERNED FOR THAT SQUIRREL.
don't YOU WORRY. I KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO WITH YOU.
I RECENTLY MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A PAIR OF BIRD LOVERS.
I'll CONSULT THEM.
narrator: OLIVE WAS REFERRING TO AUNTS LILY AND VIVIAN.
Really? I USED TO KNOW A PAIR OF BIRD LOVERS.
narrator: CHUCK ALSO REFERRED TO AUNTS LILY AND VIVIAN.
used TO? DID THEY DIE?
a DEATH WAS INVOLVED.
how UNFORTUNATE.
narrator: THEY WERE BOTH SBUSY REFERRING AND INFERRING,
they FAILED TO NOTICE THAT 60 SECONDS HAD PASSED.
the PIE MAKER COULD NOT AFFORD SUCH A LUXURY.
it's RAINING DEAD BIRDS!
what's GOING ON UP THERE?
narrator: WHAT WAS GOING ON UP THERE WAS THIS
an OUT-OF-CONTROL CROP DUSTER CRASHED HEADFIRST INTO THE BROADVIEW LUXURY APARTMENT COMPLEX,
killing THE PILOT INSTANTLY.
his BODY WAS CATAPULTED OUT OF THE COCKPIT
and INTO THE LIVING ROOM OF ONE CONRAFITCH.
does THIS -- OH
does THIS QUALIFY AS AMBULANCE-CHASING?
I'm ASKING WITHOUT ANY JUDGMENT AT ALL.
if YOU'RE ASKING WITHOUT ANY JUDGMENT,
then, YES, IT DOES.
look FOR BODY BAGS.
that's NOT OUR THING.
your THING IS WAKING UP DEAD PEOPLE.
my THING IS FINDING DEAD PEOPLE FOR YOU TO WAKE UP.
Ooh, FOUND ONE.
why CAN'T WE JUST BE HERE AS CONCERNED CITIZENS OF THE WORLD?
because BIG DADDY NEEDS SOME NEW YARN.
just BECAUSE THERE'S A DEAD BODY
doesn't MEAN YOU'RE GONNA GET PAID.
just BECAUSE THERE'S VODKA IN MY FREEZER
doesn't MEAN I HAVE TO DRINK IT.
wait, YES, IT DOES.
he's NOT WRONG.
plane CRASHES INTO A BUILDING
could MEAN A CIVIL SUIT, CRIMINAL SUIT, NEGLIGENCE,
pain AND SUFFERING, NEGLIGENT PAIN AND SUFFERI.
narrator: CHUCK FOSTERED HER LOVE OF THE LAW
by VOLUNTEERING AS A STAY-AT-HOME JUROR
for A PARAPLEGIC JUDGE.
we THE JURY FIND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY.
Oh, I'M SORRY. OOH! [ GASPS ]
narrator: UNABLE TO CATCH CHUCK WHEN SHE FELL,
the PIE MAKER WAS FORCED TO STEP ASIDE,
lowing ANOTHER MAN TO CATCH HER.
thank YOU.
forge THE MESS.
the MAID COMES TOMORROW.
guess I SHOULD CANCEL THAT.
do YOU LIVE HERE?
until VERY RECENTLY.
can YOU PUT HER DOWN, PLEASE?
at LEAST YOUR COLLECTION OF NAUTICAL PLATES SURVIVED.
those WERE FRANKLIN MINT.
Oh. I'M SORRY. NO, IT'S OKAY. I'LL BE OKAY.
I WAS FEELING LIKE I NEEDED TO SIMPLIFY MY LIFE, ANYWAY.
narrator: CHUCK'S HEART WENT OUT TO THE M WITH THE PLANE
in HIS LIVING ROOM,
despite THE PIE MAKER WANTING HER HEART FOR HIMSELF.
suddenly, AMBULANCE-CHASING DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A BAD IDEA.
[ clears THROAT ] THE AMBULANCE IS LEAVING.
Oh, YOU GO AHEAD. I'M GONNA STAY HERE,
see IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO.
I'm SURE HE'S FINE.
statistically SPEAKING, HIS DAY CAN ONLY IMPROVE.
dead PILOT, ON THE OTHER HAND,
probably HAS LOTS OF LAST WISHES.
Yeah, LIKE MAYBE HE WISHED HE'D HAVE TURNED LEFT.
you DON'T NEED ME FOR THAT.
she's GOT A POINT. BUT
don't ARGUE WITH THE WOMAN. WE GOT A DEAD GUY TO TALK TO.
narrator: THE FACTS WERE THESE
one BRADAN CADEN, AN AGRICULTURAL IATOR,
was 53 YEARS, 21 WEEKS, 5 DAYS, 6 HOURS, AND 19 MINUTES OLD, WHEN HIS CROP DUSTER COLLIDED WITH THE BROADVIEW LUXURY APARTMENT COMPLEX.
it WAS 17 MINUTES AFTER THE COLLISION,
and MR. CADEN'S INSURANCE AGENT HAD ALREADY REJECTED THE CLAIM
on HIS LIFE POLICY BEFORE THE CLAIM WAS EVEN MADE.
did YOU SEE E WAY HE JUST SWEPT IN THERE?
Yeah, SO? I DON'T SWEEP.
I'm NOT A SWEEPER.
Yeah, IT'S A LTLE SHOWY. IT'S A LOT SHOWY.
and WHAT'S A ROOFTOP FULL OF BEES COMPARED TO SOMEONE
who CAN CATCH HER WHEN SHE FALLS?
I CAN'T CATCH HER, EMERSON.
can't SUCK ON HER TOES, NEITHER.
some WOMEN LIKE THAT.
narrator: BRADAN CADEN'S WIFE, BECKY,
believed HER HUSBAND WAS NOT SUICIDAL
and WAS, IN FACT, A HAPPY MAN.
he WAS A HAPPY MAN.
these INSURANCE PEOPLE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS
about A PERSON'S DISPOSITION
one SHOULD NEVER ASSUME.
an INSURANCE AGENT CAN'T SPEAK TO THE DECEASED'S STATE OF MIND.
they DIDN'T KNOW THE DEASED. YOU DID.
pardon ME. I COULDN'T HELP BUT OVERHEAR YOUR CONVERSATION.
I BELIEVE I COULD BE HELPFUL.
may I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?
why ARE YOU BOTHERING THIS POOR WOMAN?
you AND THAT WHITE BOY GOT SOME KIND OF SHIFTY GOING ON?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT, BUT YOU'RE SHIFTY.
I'm HERE AS A CONCERNED CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.
you MAKING A DIME, CONCERNED CITIZEN?
maybe ONE OR TWO TO RUB TOGETHER.
well, THEN, FLIES LAND ON ME, THEY PAY RENT.
excuse ME. I'M J-JUST GONNA...
hello.
are YOU THE FELLOW THAT JUMPED ON MY PLANE?
no. A FELLOW JUMPED ON YOUR PLANE?
I WAS HIJACKED.
is THAT WHY YOUR PLANE CRASHED?
Oh, YES, SIRREE.
Mr. CADEN.
I WAS DUSTING SOYBEANS, OR GETTING READY TO,
and DIPPY IN A PRISON-ORANGE JUMPSUIT CLIMBED ABOARD.
dippy WAS ON BOARD WHEN YOUR PLANE CRASHED?
but YOU WERE THE ONLY DEAD DIPPY -- BODY -- THEY FOUND.
then DIPPY'S NOT DEAD. LUCKY HIM.
what IN THE HELL?
the PLANE WAS HIJACKED.
how'd YOU COME BY THAT?
DNA-ish.
narrator: OLIVE SNOOK CAME TO COEUR d'COEURS ON A WING AND A PRAYER.
with A GILDED CAGE HOUSING THE MONOWINGED BIRD IN ONE HAND
and A PIE BOX IN THE OTHER,
she SET OUTO EXPOSE CHARLOTTE CHARLES,
also KNOWN AS "CHUCK," AS A FAKER OF DEATHS.
lily: MM-HMM. IT'S A CARRIER PIGEON.
diseases OR MESSAGES?
both.
a BIRD WITH GOSSIP. HOW EXCITING.
do YOU OPEN OTHER PEOPLE'S MAIL?
well, WHO'S THE PEOPLE AND HOW HARD IS IT TO OPEN?
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM.
what's GOTTEN INTO YOU?
narrator: WHAT HAD GOTTEN INTO BOTH OF THEM
was THEIR NIECE'S HOMEOPATHIC PIE.
as WITH ANY MOOD STABILIZER,
moods WERE A BIT INCONSISTT AT THE START.
do YOU THINK YOU CAN FIX HER?
she'll ONLY GO OUT THERE AND GET HURT AGAIN.
coyotes WILL HAVE THEIR WAY WITH HER.
she WAS MEANT TO FLY.
she NEEDS TO FULFILL HER DESTINY AND DELIVER THAT MESSAGE.
a BIRD THAT STALKS DOWN HIS NARROW CAGE
can SELDOM SEE THROUGH HIS BARS OF RAGE!
it WOULDN'T HURT TO TRY.
that's THE SPIRIT.
and ONCE WE FIX PIDGE, WE CAN CELEBRATE
by TAKING A TRIP TO THE PIE HOLE.
it's A NIFTY SPOWITH LOTS OF INTERESTING FOLKS.
you NEVER KNOW O YOU MIGHT RUN INTO.
narrator: WITH THAT, OLIVE SNOOK SET HER PLAN IN MOTION.
why WOULD WE GO OUT FOR PIE
when YOU JUST BROUGHT US ONE?
I'll THINK OF A REASON.
narrator: WHILE OLIVE SNOOK CONSIDERED
how TO GET LILY AND VIVIAN OUT OF THEIR RUT,
the PIE MAKER WAS CONSIDERING WORST-CASE SCENARIOS,
not ONLY FOR A ROGUE HIJACKER,
who HE HAD BEEN HIRED TO FIND BY BECKY CADEN,
but FOR CHUCK AND THE MAN WHO CAUGHT HER
in A WAY THE PIE MAKER NEVER COULD.
they're NOT HERE. THIS IS BAD.
well, MAYBE THEY WENT FOR A STROLL.
that WOULD NOT MAKE IT BETTER.
well, WHAT'S WORSE
the TWO OF THEM LOCKED UP IN THE TRUNK OF A HIJACKER'S CAR
or SIPPING MIMOSAS IN A HOTEL ROOM?
I'm NOT A FAN OF EITHER SCENARIO, AND WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE YOUR COLOGNE.
who WEARS COLOGNE?
I WEAR COLOGNE!
[ scoffs ] LOOK.
they HAD COFFEE.
there's SOMETHING BAD IN THERE.
is THAT THE HIJACKER?
what KIND OF FOOL HIJACKER HIDES HIMSELF
in A DAMN COFFEE TABLE?
damn GOUT.
Aah, I'M SO CRAMPED, I FEEL LIKE I'M STUFFED IN A TRUNK.
you ARE STUFFED IN A TRUNK.
don't CONTRADICT AN OLD MAN. IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.
did YOU HIJACK THAT PLANE?
what PLANE? OH, HELL'S FIRE.
that THING FLEW INTO MY APARTMENT!
this IS YOUR APARTMENT?
What'd I JUST SAY?
the I WAS, ENJOYING MY DAILY PRUNES
and THE PSYLLIUM POWDER AND HOPING FOR THE BEST.
and SUDDENLY, I SEE THAT THING FLYING AT ME.
if THIS IS YOUR APARTMENT, THEN WHO IS CONRAD?
what IS THIS -- THE IDIOT BRIGADE?
[ sing-song voice ] HELLO.
do YOU LIKE PIE?
it WOULD BE CRIMINAL NOT TO LIKE PIE.
everything I AM, EVERYTHING I WAS,
everything THAT REPRESENTED ME
as A HUMAN BEING WAS IN THERE.
I HAVE TO START OVER.
I LOST EVERYTHING ONCE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
did A PLANE FLY INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM?
no. WELL, WAS IT ARSON?
no, IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE,
but I FELT A QUEER THRILL OF OPPORTUNITY.
to GET NEW STUFF?
to LET GO OF EVERYTHING ABOUT ME THAT I DIDN'T LIKE
and TO HOLD ONTO EVERYTHING ABOUT ME THAT I DID.
well, I'VE JUST MET YOU,
but I...CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING ABOUT YOU
that ISN'T SOMETHING TO LIKE.
narrator: CHUCK'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO QUICKLY PULL HER HAND AWAY.
her SECOND THOUGHT WAS HOW NICE IT FELT
to HAVE SOMEONE HOLD HER HAND.
Oh. [ CHUCKLES ] SORRY.
was THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND BACK THERE,
the ONE WHO TOOK A STEP BACK TO LET YOU FALL?
he DIDN'T LET ME FALL.
it WAS ACTUALLY A VERYFFECTIONATE GESTURE IN CONTEXT.
narrator: IF IT WAS ONLY THE PIE MAKER'S HAND.
can I ASK YOU A SMALL FAVOR?
would YOU HOLD MY HAND JUST FOR A MOMENT,
but DON'T SAY ANYTHING? AND I'M GONNA CLOSE MY EYES.
all RIGHT.
narrator: IN THAT MOMENT,
Chuck WAS HOLDING THE PIE MAKER'S HAND...
...if ONLY BY PROXY.
narrator: IT WAS THE PROXY THAT CONCERNED THE PIE MAKER.
I GOT TO PEE.
how DID IT GO?
where DID HE GO?
Conrad? HE WAS GOING TO THE BATHROOM.
he's NOT CONRAD. HE'S THE HIJACKER.
and HE'S GOING TO E BATHROOM IN MY KITCHEN.
boy, YOU MISS ONE TRIP TO THE MORGUE...
is THIS THE HAND YOU WERE HOLDING?
well, HE'S A GREAT BIG FIBBER, THEN, ISN'T HE?
a GREAT BIG FIBBER, WHOSE HAND YOU WERE HOLDING.
what's THAT ABOUT?
I WAS -- I-IF YOU MUST KNOW...
I WAS PRETENDING I WAS HOLDING YOUR HAND.
is THAT SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?
WELL...YEAH.
Oh, WELL, ON ONE HAND, IT DOES MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
on THE OTHER HAND -- THEAND YOU WERE HOLDING -- IT DOESN'T.
Ned, HE'S AN ESCAPED CONVICT.
you DIDN'T KNOW THAT WHEN YOU HELD HIS HAND.
and P. S. NOT ONLY IS HE AN ESCAPED CONVICT
he's ALSO A HIJACKER
who's PREVENTED THOUSANDS OF CROPS
from BEING AERIALLY FERTILIZED.
and HE STUFFED A SURLY OLD DEAD GUY IN A TRUNK.
I'm NOT SAYING THAT HE ISN'T GUILTY,
and I'M NOT SAYING THAT I AM.
I'm JUST SAYING THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT HIM.
no, IT'S ABOUT OUR CLIENT,
Becky CADEN, WIFE OF BRADAN CADEN,
the MAN YOUR HANDYMAN WIDOWED
when HE DECIDED TO CROP-DUST SOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM.
did YOU CATCH HIM?
[ sighs ] THAT ONE-ARMED BITCH WAS SPEEDY.
bui CHECKED IN WITH MY PEOPLE AT THE PRISON.
you GOT "PEOPLE"? THAT'S SO NEAT.
DIYOU FIND OUT
Yes.
and WE'RE GONNA NEED SHOVELS.
narrator: EMERSON COD HAD LEARNED THREE THINGS
first, THE MAN THEY KNEW AS CONRAD FITCH
was ACTUALLY ONE LEMUEL WINEGARD,
a LOW-LEVEL EMPLOYEE OF A COMPANY CALLED ORNAN ENERGY.
second, ORNAN WAS AN ENERGY-BASED CORPORATION
known FOR SEVERAL TYPES OF TRADING
plastics, STEEL, AND INSIDER.
the LATTER COST LEMUEL HIS RIGHT HAND.
narrator: IT ALSO COST HIM HIS FREEDOM.
third, DURING HIS INCARCERATION,
LEMUEL BECAME KNOWN AS "LEFTY LEM,
a NAME GIVEN TO HIM BY HIS CELLMATE, JACKSON LUCAS,
an INFAMOUS DIAMOND THIEF,
whose FINAL ESCAPADE RESULTED IN A BURIED TREASURE
that WAS NEVER RECOVERED...
he ENDED UP IN A PRISON GRAVEYARD WITH HIS SECRET.
Oh, SO LEFTY LEM WAS A WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINAL.
that MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE.
Oh, YEAH, THANK YOU.
gonna GET PAID ONCE BY THE PILOT'S WIDOW
when WE PROVE HER HUSBAND'S DEATH WASN'T A SUICIDE
dead BODIES ALWAYS LEAD TO PAYDAYS.
Yeah, YEAH, "VODKA IN THE FREEZER.
gonna GET PAID TWICE BY THE FEDS
when THEY GIVE US THE REWARD FOR KICKING LEFTY'S ASS
back TO THE CLINK, WHERE HE BELONGS.
looking FORWARD TO THAT.
and GONNA GET PAID THRICE
by FINDING JACKSON'S BURIED BOOTY.
Hey!
[ clank! ] HEY.
come TO PAPA.
Ned: WAIT. YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVERT YOUR EYES.
there's A GOOD CHANCE HE'LL BE ON THE DEWY SIDE.
damn. I HATE DEWY.
are YOU MAD AT ME?
why WOULD I BE MAD?
for HOLDING SOMEONE'S HAND THAT WASN'T YOURS.
seriously, IN A PRISON GRAVEYARD
that's WHERE Y'ALL ARE GONNA HAVE THIS CONVERSATION?
you SHOULD, UH, BREATHE THROUGH YOUR MOUTHS.
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A LITTLE MORE EYEBALL.
emerson: JUST TOUCH THE DAMN THING.
no, WAIT. FOR WHAT?
a LITTLE DIGNITY.
Thanks.
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING! AM I BLIND?
the GOOD NEWS IS, YOU'RE NOT BLIND.
bad NEWS IS, YOU'RE DEAD.
makes BLIND SEEM LIKE A WALK IN THEARK, DOESN'T IT?
Where'd YOU BURY YOUR LOOT, JACK?
ha! WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU?
good KARMA. IT'S LIKE CURRENCY IN THE AFTERLIFE.
in THE OLD WINDMILL ON THE VonRoenn FARM,
at THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS.
how MUCH THAT WORTH?
plenty. ASK HIM ABOUT LEFTY.
did YOU TELL HIM WHERE YOU BURIED IT?
[ breathes DEEPLY ] OF COURSE I DID.
owed HIM THAT MUCH.
W-what DID YOU OWE HIM FOR?
keeping THE FIRE ALIVE.
all RIGHT, WE GOT A WINDMILL TO FIND.
narrator: CHUCK'S FIRE MAY NOT BE ALIVE,
as FAR AS HER AUNTS LILY AND VIVIAN WERE CONCERNED,
but OLIVE WAS DOING HER BEST TO REIGNITE IT.
ACKETS.
brackets.
ribbon. RIBBON.
BEJEWELER. BEJEWELER.
can I DO ONE?
maybe THE LAST ONE.
if YOU LIKE, WE COULD BEJEWEL PIDGE'S BIRDHOUSE WHEN WE'RE DONE.
PIDGE'S HOUSE IS ONLY TEMPORARY.
no SENSE IN BEJEWELING AN EMPTY HOME, IS THERE, PIDGE?
there's SOMETHING SO SAD ABOUT AN EMPTY BIRDHOUSE.
when ONE OF OUR BIRDS DIES, WE TAXIDERM IT IMMEDIATELY
put IT RIGHT BACK ON ITS PERCH.
Vivian DOES WONDERS WITH SAND AND THREAD.
and LITTLE MARBLE EYES.
it's LIKE OUR BIRDS NEVER LEFT US AT ALL.
you CAN'T PUT EVERYTHING BACK ON ITS PERCH.
it MUST HAVE BEEN ALL KINDS OF HORRIBLE FOR YOU WHEN CHARLOTTE LEFT.
she DIDN'T LEAVE.
she DIED.
and NO AMOUNT OF SAND OR THREAD
or LITTLE MARBLE EYES WILL EVER BRING HER BACK.
narrator: BUT OLIVE DIDN'T NEED SAND OR THREAD
or LITTLE MARBLE EYES TO BRING CHUCK BACK.
she NEEDED A CONFLUENCE OF EVENTS.
wing.
narrator: AND SHE WAABOUT TO GET ONE.
wing.
can I DO THE LAST BEJEWEL?
[ snaps ] I ALREADY DID IT.
what DO YOU THINK, PIDGE?
narrator: AND WHILE OLIVE, THE AUNTS, AND PIDGE
looked FORWARD TO THE NEXT STEP IN THEIR JOURNEY,
another JOURNEY HAD REACHED A DEAD END.
is SHE DEAD?
lefty LEM HAS OFFICIALLY TAKEN THE LEAD.
do YOU THINK FAKE CONRAD KILLED HER?
Ockham's RAZOR -- ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, ?????
I USED TO BELIEVE THAT UNTIL YOU BROUGHT ME BACK FROM THE DEAD -- KIND OF SCREWS THE THEORY.
maybe YOUR FINGER NEEDS A NEW BATTERY.
here, LET ME TRY.
he DID IT. HE DID IT.
Oh! I MUST HAVE DOZED OFF AGAIN. UH, CAN I HELP YOU?
we're LOOKING FOR A WINDMILL, A VonRoenn-VARIETY WINDMILL.
Oh, THAT'S FUNNY.
a YOUNG MAN S JUST IN HERE, ASKING ABOUT THE VonRoenn MILL.
he DIDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE ONE ARM, DID HE?
as A MATTER OF FACT, HE DID.
[ sneezing ] OCKHAM'S! BLESS YOU.
thank YOU.
the WINDMILL -- WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?
retired. NO FARM, NO USE.
got SHIPPED OFF TO "NARM" SOME 20 YEARS AGO.
why DID THEY SEND IT TO NAM? DID THE VIETNAMESE NEED WINDMILLS?
N. A.R. M. -- NATIONAL AREA RETIRED MILLS.
the VonRoenn MILL HAS BEEN PRESERVED FOR AN HISTORICAL LANDMARK.
I HAVE A MAP HERE. [ CHUCKLES ]
now, THAT'S NARCOLEPTIC. NECROPHILIAC'S THE OTHER ONE.
Yeah.
narrator: ARMED WITH A NEW PLAN,
the PIE MAKER AND ASSOCIATES LEFT THE NARCOLEPTIC CURATOR TO HER DREAMS.
meanwhile, BACK IN COEUR d'COEURS,
a TINY FRIEND WAS PLANNING HER OWN ESCAPE.
olive's DISDAIN FOR CHUCK WAS SPLIT IN TWO
one FOR STEALING THE PIE MAKER'S HEART
and THE OTHER FOR BREAKING THE AUNTS'.
you KNOW YOU WANT TO READ PIDGE'S MESSAGE.
Lily WOULD BE SO DISPLEASED.
there WAS AN INCIDENT.
I READ SOMETHING THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE, AND THEN LIFE WENT HORRIBLY AWRY.
Lily NEVER FORGAVE ME.
she SAID SHE DID, BUT SHE DIDN'T.
Wow. NOW I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THAT STORY.
let's PUT PIDGE BACK INTO HER HOUSE.
PIDGE HAS LEFT THE BUILDING. I'M SORRY.
I'sorry HER EMPTY BIRDHOUSE MAKES YOU SAD.
maybe YOU COULD FILL IT WITH ALL YOUR CHARLOTTE SADNESS
and HANG IT IN A SPECIAL PLACE IN YOUR SOUL.
that's AN AWFULLY SAD BIRDHOUSE TO HAVE HANGING IN ONE'S SOUL.
hang IT SOMEPLACE YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE IT.
it WON'T ALWAYS BE SAD.
it'll BE THE HAPPIEST LITTLE BIRDHOUSE WHEN YOU'RE READY.
make A LITTLE BIRDHOUSE IN YOUR SOUL.
don't ENCOURAGE HER.
I THINK SHE LOOKS DIVINE.
son OF A BITCH.
wait! YOU FORGOT YOUR MESSAGE! PIDGE!
PIDGE, WAIT! YOU FORGOT YOUR MESSAGE!
narrator: AS THE AUNTS WATCHED OLIVE SCREAM FORELP...
help ME! PIDGE!
narrator: ...THEY CONSIDERED THEIR OWN BIRDCAGE
and WONDERED IF THEY WERE READY TO LEAVE IT BEHIND.
a FEW MILES AWAY...
looking OUT ACROSS THE FIELDS,
a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN NAMED ELSITA WAITED FOR THE MAN SHE LOVED
to MAKE HER HEART COMPLETE.
little DID SHE KNOW LEFTY LEM WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY.
what THE HELL DO YOU WANT?
I'm FROM THE PAPEN COUNTY HISTORICAL SOCIETY.
we'd LIKE TO PHOTOGRAPH THESE PREMISES FOR OUR 87th ANNUAL "MILLS OF THE WIND PAPEN COUNTY COLLECTOR'S CALENDAR.
Where's YOUR CAMERA?
it's IN THE CAR.
you're LYING.
but I'M BORED.
never MIND THE SINGING. KEEP YOUR EYE ON THAT BIRD.
you KNOW WHAT OUR PROBLEM IS.
if YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE TOUCHING THING,
I SEE IT AS MORE OF AN OBSTACLE THAN A PROBLEM.
it's A PRETTY BIG OBSTACLE.
not COMPARED TO OUR OTHER PROBLEMS.
we've GOT "OTHER PROBLEMS"?
I'm GONNA KILL MYSELF.
there's SO MUCH I'M LEARNING ABOUT YOU.
such AS?
you're ROMANTIC.
when THE MOOD STRIKES.
and YOU'RE JEALOUS WHEN THE MOOD STRIKES.
everyone's A LITTLE JEALOUS.
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE NOT A LITTLE JEALOUS, YOU'RE PROBABLY...
[ exhales RAGGEDLY ] CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT THIS?
the ANSWER TO YOUR QUERY IS "YES.
no, ACTUALLY, I-I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
I COULD LET IT GO, BUT LIKE THE CAT, IT WILL COME BACK,
which I WOULDN'T CALL ANNOYING,
but THERE'S NO REALLY GREAT WAY OF SAYING "HALF ANNOYING,
which IT IS A LITTLE BIT.
see? ISN'T THIS NEAT?
here WE WERE, THINKING ALL WE HAD WAS ONE BIG PROBLEM,
when, INCTUAL FACT, WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF LITTLE PROBLEMS
that WE GOT TO SORT OUT BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO THE BIG PROBLEM,
which MEANS WE'RE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD.
except I STILL CAN'T CATCH YOU.
Yeah, WE TAKING TWO CARS NEXT TIME.
that's A BIG AX.
Oh, I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU. I PROMISE.
this IS, UH, JUST A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.
wouldn't IT BE EASIER IF YOU PUT THE AX DOWN,
then TIED THE ROPE?
it's FUNNY -- YOU REALLY ARE A ONE-ARMED BANDIT.
your NAME'S NOT McCLAPPING, IS IT?
as IN "THE SOUND OF ONE HAND..." NO.
cause NAMES ARE DESTINY.
if YOU THINK "DWAYNE CLOGGIN
ain't GONNA GROW UP TO BE A PLUMBER,
then YOU JUST THINK AGAIN.
Oh, NO, YOU DIDN'T USE BOWS TO TIE ME UP, DID YOU?
you TAKE A HOSTAGE LIKE YOU TIE YOUR SNEAKERS.
what IS YOUR PROBLEM?
well, I WAS BORN INTO THE LIFE OF WINDMILLERY.
are YOU GONNA LISTEN, OR ARE YOU GONNA KEEP KNOCKING?
I'm LISTENING.
you WERE BORN INTO THE FE OF WINDMILLERY.
always WAITING ON THE WIND TO SHOW UP,
so YOU CAN START WORK, AND I'M NO GOOD AT WAITING.
I'm TIRED OF IT.
you SURE IT WAS THE WIND THAT YOU WERE A-WAITING FOR?
did YOU JUST SAY "A-WAITING"?
cause IF YOU ARE MIMICKING ME,
I WILL BE OUT OF THESE GIRLY BOWS
faster THAN A SNAKE THROUGH WEEDS!
I WASN'T THINKING, AND I APOLOGIZE.
it's JUST, WELL, I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND,
and I'M IN A BIT OF A RUSH.
Oh, WHERE YOU RUSHING TO?
well, I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET.
well MAYBE YOU BETTER FIGURE THAT OUT.
go BACK TO YOUR KNOCKING. [ CLEARS THROAT ]
come ON, PIDGE! YOU CAN DO IT!
not EVEN A BREEZE TO HELP POOR PIDGE,
which IS KIND OF IRONIC, GIVEN THE SURROUNDINGS.
PIDGE! COME ON!
narrator: THE PIGEON, GROWING FATIGUED WITEACH FLAP
of HER TAXIDERMIED WING,
knew SOMETHING THE OTHERS DID NOT.
[ squawks ] HER JOURNEY WAS ALMOST COMPLETE.
what WAS THAT?
it's MY BIRD!
that's MY BIRD.
what ARE YOU ON ABOUT? IT'S MY BIRD.
I'll PROVE IT. I WROTE THE NOTE.
Where's THE NOTE?
Olive: HELLO?
can I GET MY BIRD BACK, PLEASE?
your BIRD? YOUR BIRD?
Yes, MY BIRD. SHE'S A CARRIER PIGEON.
she HAS A MESSAGE, AND SHE HAS TO CARRY IT.
it's WHAT SHE DOES.
that's MY MESSAGE.
I'm ELSITA. JACKSON?
I'm LEM.
Elsa WAS MY MAMA.
jackson WAS MY PRISON BUNKMATE.
is "BUNKMATE" A EUPHEMISM FOR
not IN THIS CASE, MA'AM. [ THUNDER CRASHING ]
narrator: THERE WAS A BITTER CHILL IN THE AIR
the NIGHT JACKSON LUCAS FOUND REFUGE IN THE VonRoenn WINDML.
already FIVE DAYS ON THE LAM,
he KNEW THE POLICE WERE CLOSING IN.
to PRESERVE HIS DREAMS OF ONE DAY OWNING AN ARTALLERY IN MEXICO,
jackson DECIDED TO BURY HIS STOLEN TREASURE
in THE STAIRCASE OF THE SEEMINGLY ABANDONED PROPERTY.
his HEART STOPPED, HOWEVER,
when HE SAW AN ANGELIC CREATURE DESCENDING THE STAIRS.
her NAME WAS ELSA, AND THIS WAS HER WINDMILL.
my NAME IS ELSA.
this IS MY WINDMILL.
narrator: IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
knowing HE HAD VERY LITTLE TIME LEFT, HE KSED HER.
the NEXT MOMENT WAS NOT.
I'll WRITE YOU!
narrator: ELSA KEPT TRUE TO HER WORD.
for THE NEXT 20 YEARS,
she AND JACKSON CONTINUED THEIR LOVE AFFAIR BY CORRESPONDENCE,
letters SENT TO AND FRO
with THE HELP OF HER VIRTUALLY UNTRACEABLE CARRIER PIGEON,
until THE DAY JACKSON KNEW HE WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO KEEP HIS PROMISE.
someone ELSE WOULD HAVE TO DO IT FOR HIM.
after JACKSON DIED, I STARTED TO PLAN MY ESCAPE.
it TOOK ME TWO YEARS.
and ALL THAT TIME, I KEPT WRITING TO ELSA.
first, I WAS WRITING OUT OF LOYALTY TO THE MAN
who TAUGHT ME THE ROPES IN PRISON,
but AFTER A WHILE, I STARTED TO DEVELOP...
a CONDITION?
FOELSA -- AT LEAST, I THOUGHT IT WAS ELSA.
and MAMA MADE ME SWEAR ON HER DEATHBED
that I'D NEVER STOP WRITING TO JACKSON,
said IT WOULD BREAK HIS HEART TO LEARN THAT SHE DIED.
but EACH LETTER WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE LAST,
and I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM.
well, YOUR LETTERS WERE BEAUTIFUL, TOO.
what's THE BIG WHOOP?
PIDGE BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER.
Olive: HOW DID SHE LOSE HER WING?
I TOOK HER WITH ME ON THE PLANE
when I BUSTED OUT OF PRISON.
she FLEW OUT THE WINDOW AFTER TAKEOFF
and WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE PROPELLER.
Oh! PIDGE CRASHED THE PLANE.
[ chuckling ] OH, PIDGE.
what HAPPENED TO THE DIAMONDS?
together: "DIAMONDS"?
holy CRAP!
holy CRAP!
now, NOW, LET'S NOT PANIC.
I'm SURE IT'S JUST THE MAILMAN
or A WINDMILL-TO-WINDMILL SALESMAN.
let ME HANDLE IT.
narrator: AS OLIVE PEEPED THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE,
it OCCURRED TO HER THAT,
while THE CARRIER PIGEON WAS SAFE INSIDE THE WINDMILL,
the SAME COULD NOT BE SAID FOR THE SITTING DUCK
currently WAITING ON THE DOORSTEP.
narrator: THIS WAS THE MOMENT OLIVE SNOOK HAD BEEN WAITING FOR.
she NEED ONLY OPEN THE DOOR
to EXPOSE CHUCK'S DECEIT TO THE AUNTS,
and THE PIE MAKER COULD BE HERS.
it WAS EVERYTHING OLIVE WANTED, AND YET...
she KNEW THAT THE AUNTS WOULD BE TRAUMATIZED
by THE DISCOVERY THAT THE LATE CHARLOTTE CHARLES
in THAT MOMENT,
olive FELT THE ANGRY FIRE IN HER HEART
extinguished BY A LIGHT BREEZE
she HAD GROWN FOND OF LILY AND VIVIAN
and COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO HURT THEM.
afternoon, GANG!
what THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
pie DELIVERY. TART APPLE, I BELIEVE.
narrator: WITH THOSE TWO WORDS, CHUCK KNEW.
her AUNTS WERE INSIDE.
if YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, AND I THINK YOU DO,
you'll GIVE ME TWO MINUTES.
Why? WHAT FOR? OKAY.
goody, THEN.
who WAS IT?
wrong MILL.
must HAPPEN A LOT AROUND HERE, HUH?
anyway, I FEEL JUST AWFUL
that WE'VE TAKEN UP SO MUCH OF YOUR DAY.
we SHOULD REALLY BE GOING.
uh, DO YOU MIND IF WE USE THE BACK DOOR?
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A PEEK AT YOUR GARDEN ON THE WAY OUT.
Thanks! BYE!
do YOU REMEMBER BEFORE,
when I TOLD YOU ALL THE THINGS I'D LEARNED ABOUT YOU?
jealous, ROMANTIC, JEALOUS.
I FELT I HAD TO SAY IT TWICE.
right. WELL, NOW MIGHT BE A REALLY GOOD TIME
for YOU TO WRITE DOWN ALL THE THINGS YOU LEARNED ABOUT ME.
Why?
well, THAT WAY, IF STUFF HAPPENS...
just REMEMBER THE LIST.
emerson: TIME'S UP.
well, NOW, WASN'T THAT A NICE OUTING?
I COULD USE A DRINK.
young PEOPLE DEPRESS LILY BECAUSE SHE'S AFRAID OF DYING.
narrator: AS LILY WONDERED WHETHER SHE WAS AFRAID OF DYING
or SIMPLY MISSED FEELING ALIVE
she ALLOWED HERSELF ONE DEEP BREATH OF FRESH COUNTRY AIR.
I DON'T THINK WE'VE BEEN OUT NCE -- CHARLOTTE?!
no NEED TO YELL HER NAME.
I THINK HEAVEN'S CLOSER THAN WE THINK.
I AGREE.
hand UP!
lemuel, I'LL WRITE YOU!
narrator: THE PIE MAKER AND THE GIRL HE CALLED "CHUCK
marveled AT LOVE'S POWER CONQUER ALL OBSTACLES
distance AND TIME...
hardship AND PAIN...
a LACK OF RECIPROCATION...
even DEATH.
your HUSBAND WAS A GREAT PILOT.
he DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF. A PIGEON DID, BY ACCIDENT.
narrator: WITH PIDGE'S HELP,
the LONG-DISTANCE LOVE AFFAIR OF LEFTY AND ELSITA CONTINUED TO SOAR.
while SOME OBSTACLES MAY NEVER DISAPPEAR...
care TO DANCE?
hmm. YES, PLEASE.
narrator: ...YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO WORK AROUND THEM.
you CAUGHT ME.
you ONLY GOT A MINUTE. I KNOW.
60 SECONDS. I KNOW.
what IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE DEAD?
you TOUCH MURDER VICTIMS, YOU ASK WHO KILLED THEM.
you TOUCH THEM AGAIN, THEY GO BACK TO BEING DEAD,
and YOU COLLECT THE REWARD? NOBODY CAN KNOW.
I CAN'T EVEN HUG YOU? YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME.
so A KISS IS OUT OF THE QUESTION?
who's THE FUNNY GIRL STUCK TO NED? CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART.
he DIGS HER IN A WAY HE DEFINITELY DOESN'T DIG YOU.
CHUCK: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME BACK TO LIFE.
people AREN'T USED TO THIS SORT OF THING.
issues OF MORALITY, HOW COME SHE'S NOT DEAD ANYMORE?
you UNDERSTAND YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR AUNTS.
it'd BE A DISASTER.
this PIE SMELLS DELICIOUS.
we RECENTLY LOST OUR NIECE.
your NIECE, CHARLOTTE CHARLES, IS DEAD?
presently?
narrator: AT THIS VERY MOMENT, IN THE TOWN OF NORTH THRUSH,
young NED WAS...
lonely.
unable TO MAKE FRIENDS AT THE LONGBURROW SCHOOL FOR BOYS,
he OFTEN FOUND HIMSELF PLAYING ALONE,
with NOTHING BUT MEMORIES OF HAPPIER TIMES
to KEEP HIS COMPANY.
what YOUNG NED DID NOT REALIZE WAS THAT,
beyond THE MEADOW AND UNDER THE SAME ORANGE SKY,
someone HE LOVED WAS REMEMBERING HIM.
his DOG, DIGBY.
in FACT, THREE DAYS PRIOR, DIGBY HAD MADE A DECISION.
wearied BY HIS OWN LONELINESS BACK IN COEUR d'COEURS
and SENSINHIS MASTER'S SORROW, DIGBY SET OUT ON A MISSION.
uncertain AS TO HIS EXACT DESTINATION,
he VENTURED INTO THE GREAT UNKNOWN,
guided ONLY BY THE COMPASS OF HIS HEART.
narrator: DESPITE NUMEROUS DISTRACTIONS, [ SIREN WAILING ] DIGBY WAS DETERMINED TO FIND YOUNG NED,
the BOY WHO HAD GIVEN HIM A SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE...
and WHO WAS HIS BEST FRIEND.
upon DOING SO, DIGBY PROVED THAT LOVE CAN OVERCOME ANY OBSTACLE.
the REUNION WAS BITTERSWEET, HOWEVER,
as THEY INSTANTLY REMEMBERED THE RESTRICTIONS OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP.
they COULD NOT TOUCH, OR DIGBY WOULD DIE.
still, IT WAS ENOUGH.
narrator: THAT DAY, DIGBY VOWED HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN ALLOW HIMSELF
to BE SEPARATED FROM HIS MASTER.
the PIE MAKER DID NOT WISH TO BE SEPARATED FROM CHUCK,
who, IN TURN, DID NOT WISH TO BE SEPARATED FROM HER AUNTS,
Lily AND VIVIAN,
who CONTINUED TO BE CHALLENGED BY SOCIAL PHOBIAS.
unbeknownst TO THE PIE MAKER,
Chuck SECRETLY BAKED HOMEOPATHIC MOOD ENHANCERS INTO PIES FOR HER AUNTS,
hoping THAT A SLICE A DAY
Oh, YOU'RE UP EARLY.
um -- OH, I COULDN'T SLEEP.
lumpy MATTRESS? LUMPY DREAMS.
which ARE A LOT MORE VIVID NOW THAN THEY WERE BEFORE I DIED.
isn't THAT INTERESTING?
just ONE OF THOSE... LITTLE THINGS.
what ARE THOSE?
Oh, I, UH...
got BIT.
those ARE BEESTINGS.
how'd YOU GET STUNG BY SO MANY BEES?
and WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BEES THAT STUNG YOU?
that's A SUICIDE ATTACK.
not IN THIS CASE.
they, UH, SORT OF STUNG ME, DIED,
then THEY FLEW AWAY AGAIN, AND SOME OTHER BEES DIED.
do YOU THINK THEIR HONEY TASTES DIFFERENT 'CAUSE THEY DIED?
wouldn't THAT BE INTERESTING?
just ONE OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
bees!
your BEES.
my BEES? YOU MEAN...
no, NOT THOSE BEES -- NEW BEES.
technically, STILL YOUR BEES,
just...not THE BEES THAT YOU KNEW.
but I'M SURE THEY'RE EQUALLY NICE.
you DO REALIZE THAT BEEKEEPING WITHIN CITY LIMITS
is COMPLETELY ILLEGAL. YES.
and I'M ALMOST SURE I DON'T CARE.
well, I CAN NOT CARE ENOUGH FOR THE BOTH OF US.
we CAN PLANT WILD FLOWERS ON ROOFTOPS
and BE UNORTHODOX URBAN HONEY PIONEERS.
[ Chuckles ] THANK YOU.
thank YOU. THANK YOU.
if I COULD HUG YOU RIGHT NOW -- I KNOW THAT I CAN'T, BUT
[ sighs ] JUST KNOW THAT I WANT TO.
I DO.
narrator: AS CHUCK CONSIDERED HER FUTURE
as AN UNORTHODOX URBAN HONEY PIONEER...
olive SNOOK CONSIDERED HOW THE MAN SHE LOVED
seemed TO BE IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.
narrator: HER AFFECTION FO THE PIE MAKER HAD NOT WAVERED,
despite THE ROMANTIC THREAT OF A DEAD GIRL WHO WASN'T DEAD.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT.
narrator: ON THE CONTRARY,
olive's RESOLVE HAD ONLY INCREASED
since THE REALIZATION THAT CHUCK, INDEED,
was SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.
good MORNING! OLIVE ASSUMED CHUCK HAD FAKED HER OWN DEATH.
she WOULD KEEP THE SECRET FOR NOW,
as CHUCK KEPT HER SECRET FROM THE PIE MAKER.
there's A PIE IN MY OVEN.
Oh, UH, THAT'S MINE. I WAS PRACTICING.
it SMELLS LIKE CHEESE. IS IT QUICHE?
I BAKED MONASTERY GOUDA INTO THE CRU
tart APPLE FILLING.
I THOUGHT I'D TRY IT.
Olive: YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE DELICIOUS?
Yeah, IT WOULD.
narrator: UNBEKNOWNST TO CHUCK,
olive UNDERSTOOD THE DELICIOUSNESS
thank YOU.
narrator: ...BECAUSE SHE SECRETLY DELIVERED
that FIRST MOOD-ENHANCING PIE TO AUNTS LILY AND VIVIAN,
as SHE WOULD DELIVER THIS ONE...
narrator: ...BUT NOT BEFORE A COLLISION OCCURRED.
Oh! I THINK SHE'S DEAD!
can YOU FEEL A HEARTBEAT? I DON'T...D-DO HEARTBEATS.
well, THEY FEEL LIKE THIS. COME HERE.
is THAT A DEAD BIRD?
why ARE YOU TOUCHING A DEAD BIRD?
throw THAT AWAY.
it's SWIMMING WITH DISEASE, AND YOU SERVE FOOD.
don't BE SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN.
besides, IT DOESN'T LOOK DISEASED.
it's DEAD, AND IT'S A BIRD. IT'S DISEASED.
it's A MIRACLE BIRD!
it's SWIMMING IN MIRACLES, NOT DISEASE!
maybe I SHOULD HOLD IT.
Oh, NO, REALLY, DO YOU HAVE TO?
she's OBVIOUSLY BEEN THROUGH A LOT,
and SHE SEEMS REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE.
narrator: HAVING BROUGHT A DEAD THING BACK TO LIFE,
the PIE MAKER FRETTED OVER WHO, OR WHAT, WOULD PAY
for THAT LIFE WITH ITS OWN.
I WONDER HOW SHE LOST HER WING.
doesn't SEEM TO BE IN ANY PAIN.
she's PROBABLY NOT IN PAIN.
but WHAT DO I KNOW? I'M NOT A BIRD.
pigeon. PIGEON.
uh, PIGEON-TOED AS A CHILD,
but ORTHOPEDIC SHOES SOLVED THAT.
[ chuckling ] YEAH.
what IS THE RATE OF EXCHANGE ON THE LIFE OF A BIRD?
cause IF IT'S EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN MINE,
I NEED TO GET BACK TO MY CAR.
I'm MORE CONCERNED FOR THAT SQUIRREL.
don't YOU WORRY. I KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO WITH YOU.
I RECENTLY MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A PAIR OF BIRD LOVERS.
I'll CONSULT THEM.
narrator: OLIVE WAS REFERRING TO AUNTS LILY AND VIVIAN.
Really? I USED TO KNOW A PAIR OF BIRD LOVERS.
narrator: CHUCK ALSO REFERRED TO AUNTS LILY AND VIVIAN.
used TO? DID THEY DIE?
a DEATH WAS INVOLVED.
how UNFORTUNATE.
narrator: THEY WERE BOTH SBUSY REFERRING AND INFERRING,
they FAILED TO NOTICE THAT 60 SECONDS HAD PASSED.
the PIE MAKER COULD NOT AFFORD SUCH A LUXURY.
it's RAINING DEAD BIRDS!
what's GOING ON UP THERE?
narrator: WHAT WAS GOING ON UP THERE WAS THIS
an OUT-OF-CONTROL CROP DUSTER CRASHED HEADFIRST INTO THE BROADVIEW LUXURY APARTMENT COMPLEX,
killing THE PILOT INSTANTLY.
his BODY WAS CATAPULTED OUT OF THE COCKPIT
and INTO THE LIVING ROOM OF ONE CONRAFITCH.
does THIS -- OH
does THIS QUALIFY AS AMBULANCE-CHASING?
I'm ASKING WITHOUT ANY JUDGMENT AT ALL.
if YOU'RE ASKING WITHOUT ANY JUDGMENT,
then, YES, IT DOES.
look FOR BODY BAGS.
that's NOT OUR THING.
your THING IS WAKING UP DEAD PEOPLE.
my THING IS FINDING DEAD PEOPLE FOR YOU TO WAKE UP.
Ooh, FOUND ONE.
why CAN'T WE JUST BE HERE AS CONCERNED CITIZENS OF THE WORLD?
because BIG DADDY NEEDS SOME NEW YARN.
just BECAUSE THERE'S A DEAD BODY
doesn't MEAN YOU'RE GONNA GET PAID.
just BECAUSE THERE'S VODKA IN MY FREEZER
doesn't MEAN I HAVE TO DRINK IT.
wait, YES, IT DOES.
he's NOT WRONG.
plane CRASHES INTO A BUILDING
could MEAN A CIVIL SUIT, CRIMINAL SUIT, NEGLIGENCE,
pain AND SUFFERING, NEGLIGENT PAIN AND SUFFERI.
narrator: CHUCK FOSTERED HER LOVE OF THE LAW
by VOLUNTEERING AS A STAY-AT-HOME JUROR
for A PARAPLEGIC JUDGE.
we THE JURY FIND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY.
Oh, I'M SORRY. OOH! [ GASPS ]
narrator: UNABLE TO CATCH CHUCK WHEN SHE FELL,
the PIE MAKER WAS FORCED TO STEP ASIDE,
lowing ANOTHER MAN TO CATCH HER.
thank YOU.
forge THE MESS.
the MAID COMES TOMORROW.
guess I SHOULD CANCEL THAT.
do YOU LIVE HERE?
until VERY RECENTLY.
can YOU PUT HER DOWN, PLEASE?
at LEAST YOUR COLLECTION OF NAUTICAL PLATES SURVIVED.
those WERE FRANKLIN MINT.
Oh. I'M SORRY. NO, IT'S OKAY. I'LL BE OKAY.
I WAS FEELING LIKE I NEEDED TO SIMPLIFY MY LIFE, ANYWAY.
narrator: CHUCK'S HEART WENT OUT TO THE M WITH THE PLANE
in HIS LIVING ROOM,
despite THE PIE MAKER WANTING HER HEART FOR HIMSELF.
suddenly, AMBULANCE-CHASING DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A BAD IDEA.
[ clears THROAT ] THE AMBULANCE IS LEAVING.
Oh, YOU GO AHEAD. I'M GONNA STAY HERE,
see IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO.
I'm SURE HE'S FINE.
statistically SPEAKING, HIS DAY CAN ONLY IMPROVE.
dead PILOT, ON THE OTHER HAND,
probably HAS LOTS OF LAST WISHES.
Yeah, LIKE MAYBE HE WISHED HE'D HAVE TURNED LEFT.
you DON'T NEED ME FOR THAT.
she's GOT A POINT. BUT
don't ARGUE WITH THE WOMAN. WE GOT A DEAD GUY TO TALK TO.
narrator: THE FACTS WERE THESE
one BRADAN CADEN, AN AGRICULTURAL IATOR,
was 53 YEARS, 21 WEEKS, 5 DAYS, 6 HOURS, AND 19 MINUTES OLD, WHEN HIS CROP DUSTER COLLIDED WITH THE BROADVIEW LUXURY APARTMENT COMPLEX.
it WAS 17 MINUTES AFTER THE COLLISION,
and MR. CADEN'S INSURANCE AGENT HAD ALREADY REJECTED THE CLAIM
on HIS LIFE POLICY BEFORE THE CLAIM WAS EVEN MADE.
did YOU SEE E WAY HE JUST SWEPT IN THERE?
Yeah, SO? I DON'T SWEEP.
I'm NOT A SWEEPER.
Yeah, IT'S A LTLE SHOWY. IT'S A LOT SHOWY.
and WHAT'S A ROOFTOP FULL OF BEES COMPARED TO SOMEONE
who CAN CATCH HER WHEN SHE FALLS?
I CAN'T CATCH HER, EMERSON.
can't SUCK ON HER TOES, NEITHER.
some WOMEN LIKE THAT.
narrator: BRADAN CADEN'S WIFE, BECKY,
believed HER HUSBAND WAS NOT SUICIDAL
and WAS, IN FACT, A HAPPY MAN.
he WAS A HAPPY MAN.
these INSURANCE PEOPLE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS
about A PERSON'S DISPOSITION
one SHOULD NEVER ASSUME.
an INSURANCE AGENT CAN'T SPEAK TO THE DECEASED'S STATE OF MIND.
they DIDN'T KNOW THE DEASED. YOU DID.
pardon ME. I COULDN'T HELP BUT OVERHEAR YOUR CONVERSATION.
I BELIEVE I COULD BE HELPFUL.
may I HAVE A WORD WITH YOU?
why ARE YOU BOTHERING THIS POOR WOMAN?
you AND THAT WHITE BOY GOT SOME KIND OF SHIFTY GOING ON?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT, BUT YOU'RE SHIFTY.
I'm HERE AS A CONCERNED CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.
you MAKING A DIME, CONCERNED CITIZEN?
maybe ONE OR TWO TO RUB TOGETHER.
well, THEN, FLIES LAND ON ME, THEY PAY RENT.
excuse ME. I'M J-JUST GONNA...
hello.
are YOU THE FELLOW THAT JUMPED ON MY PLANE?
no. A FELLOW JUMPED ON YOUR PLANE?
I WAS HIJACKED.
is THAT WHY YOUR PLANE CRASHED?
Oh, YES, SIRREE.
Mr. CADEN.
I WAS DUSTING SOYBEANS, OR GETTING READY TO,
and DIPPY IN A PRISON-ORANGE JUMPSUIT CLIMBED ABOARD.
dippy WAS ON BOARD WHEN YOUR PLANE CRASHED?
but YOU WERE THE ONLY DEAD DIPPY -- BODY -- THEY FOUND.
then DIPPY'S NOT DEAD. LUCKY HIM.
what IN THE HELL?
the PLANE WAS HIJACKED.
how'd YOU COME BY THAT?
DNA-ish.
narrator: OLIVE SNOOK CAME TO COEUR d'COEURS ON A WING AND A PRAYER.
with A GILDED CAGE HOUSING THE MONOWINGED BIRD IN ONE HAND
and A PIE BOX IN THE OTHER,
she SET OUTO EXPOSE CHARLOTTE CHARLES,
also KNOWN AS "CHUCK," AS A FAKER OF DEATHS.
lily: MM-HMM. IT'S A CARRIER PIGEON.
diseases OR MESSAGES?
both.
a BIRD WITH GOSSIP. HOW EXCITING.
do YOU OPEN OTHER PEOPLE'S MAIL?
well, WHO'S THE PEOPLE AND HOW HARD IS IT TO OPEN?
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM.
what's GOTTEN INTO YOU?
narrator: WHAT HAD GOTTEN INTO BOTH OF THEM
was THEIR NIECE'S HOMEOPATHIC PIE.
as WITH ANY MOOD STABILIZER,
moods WERE A BIT INCONSISTT AT THE START.
do YOU THINK YOU CAN FIX HER?
she'll ONLY GO OUT THERE AND GET HURT AGAIN.
coyotes WILL HAVE THEIR WAY WITH HER.
she WAS MEANT TO FLY.
she NEEDS TO FULFILL HER DESTINY AND DELIVER THAT MESSAGE.
a BIRD THAT STALKS DOWN HIS NARROW CAGE
can SELDOM SEE THROUGH HIS BARS OF RAGE!
it WOULDN'T HURT TO TRY.
that's THE SPIRIT.
and ONCE WE FIX PIDGE, WE CAN CELEBRATE
by TAKING A TRIP TO THE PIE HOLE.
it's A NIFTY SPOWITH LOTS OF INTERESTING FOLKS.
you NEVER KNOW O YOU MIGHT RUN INTO.
narrator: WITH THAT, OLIVE SNOOK SET HER PLAN IN MOTION.
why WOULD WE GO OUT FOR PIE
when YOU JUST BROUGHT US ONE?
I'll THINK OF A REASON.
narrator: WHILE OLIVE SNOOK CONSIDERED
how TO GET LILY AND VIVIAN OUT OF THEIR RUT,
the PIE MAKER WAS CONSIDERING WORST-CASE SCENARIOS,
not ONLY FOR A ROGUE HIJACKER,
who HE HAD BEEN HIRED TO FIND BY BECKY CADEN,
but FOR CHUCK AND THE MAN WHO CAUGHT HER
in A WAY THE PIE MAKER NEVER COULD.
they're NOT HERE. THIS IS BAD.
well, MAYBE THEY WENT FOR A STROLL.
that WOULD NOT MAKE IT BETTER.
well, WHAT'S WORSE
the TWO OF THEM LOCKED UP IN THE TRUNK OF A HIJACKER'S CAR
or SIPPING MIMOSAS IN A HOTEL ROOM?
I'm NOT A FAN OF EITHER SCENARIO, AND WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE YOUR COLOGNE.
who WEARS COLOGNE?
I WEAR COLOGNE!
[ scoffs ] LOOK.
they HAD COFFEE.
there's SOMETHING BAD IN THERE.
is THAT THE HIJACKER?
what KIND OF FOOL HIJACKER HIDES HIMSELF
in A DAMN COFFEE TABLE?
damn GOUT.
Aah, I'M SO CRAMPED, I FEEL LIKE I'M STUFFED IN A TRUNK.
you ARE STUFFED IN A TRUNK.
don't CONTRADICT AN OLD MAN. IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.
did YOU HIJACK THAT PLANE?
what PLANE? OH, HELL'S FIRE.
that THING FLEW INTO MY APARTMENT!
this IS YOUR APARTMENT?
What'd I JUST SAY?
the I WAS, ENJOYING MY DAILY PRUNES
and THE PSYLLIUM POWDER AND HOPING FOR THE BEST.
and SUDDENLY, I SEE THAT THING FLYING AT ME.
if THIS IS YOUR APARTMENT, THEN WHO IS CONRAD?
what IS THIS -- THE IDIOT BRIGADE?
[ sing-song voice ] HELLO.
do YOU LIKE PIE?
it WOULD BE CRIMINAL NOT TO LIKE PIE.
everything I AM, EVERYTHING I WAS,
everything THAT REPRESENTED ME
as A HUMAN BEING WAS IN THERE.
I HAVE TO START OVER.
I LOST EVERYTHING ONCE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
did A PLANE FLY INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM?
no. WELL, WAS IT ARSON?
no, IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE,
but I FELT A QUEER THRILL OF OPPORTUNITY.
to GET NEW STUFF?
to LET GO OF EVERYTHING ABOUT ME THAT I DIDN'T LIKE
and TO HOLD ONTO EVERYTHING ABOUT ME THAT I DID.
well, I'VE JUST MET YOU,
but I...CAN'T IMAGINE ANYTHING ABOUT YOU
that ISN'T SOMETHING TO LIKE.
narrator: CHUCK'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO QUICKLY PULL HER HAND AWAY.
her SECOND THOUGHT WAS HOW NICE IT FELT
to HAVE SOMEONE HOLD HER HAND.
Oh. [ CHUCKLES ] SORRY.
was THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND BACK THERE,
the ONE WHO TOOK A STEP BACK TO LET YOU FALL?
he DIDN'T LET ME FALL.
it WAS ACTUALLY A VERYFFECTIONATE GESTURE IN CONTEXT.
narrator: IF IT WAS ONLY THE PIE MAKER'S HAND.
can I ASK YOU A SMALL FAVOR?
would YOU HOLD MY HAND JUST FOR A MOMENT,
but DON'T SAY ANYTHING? AND I'M GONNA CLOSE MY EYES.
all RIGHT.
narrator: IN THAT MOMENT,
Chuck WAS HOLDING THE PIE MAKER'S HAND...
...if ONLY BY PROXY.
narrator: IT WAS THE PROXY THAT CONCERNED THE PIE MAKER.
I GOT TO PEE.
how DID IT GO?
where DID HE GO?
Conrad? HE WAS GOING TO THE BATHROOM.
he's NOT CONRAD. HE'S THE HIJACKER.
and HE'S GOING TO E BATHROOM IN MY KITCHEN.
boy, YOU MISS ONE TRIP TO THE MORGUE...
is THIS THE HAND YOU WERE HOLDING?
well, HE'S A GREAT BIG FIBBER, THEN, ISN'T HE?
a GREAT BIG FIBBER, WHOSE HAND YOU WERE HOLDING.
what's THAT ABOUT?
I WAS -- I-IF YOU MUST KNOW...
I WAS PRETENDING I WAS HOLDING YOUR HAND.
is THAT SUPPOSED TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?
WELL...YEAH.
Oh, WELL, ON ONE HAND, IT DOES MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.
on THE OTHER HAND -- THEAND YOU WERE HOLDING -- IT DOESN'T.
Ned, HE'S AN ESCAPED CONVICT.
you DIDN'T KNOW THAT WHEN YOU HELD HIS HAND.
and P. S. NOT ONLY IS HE AN ESCAPED CONVICT
he's ALSO A HIJACKER
who's PREVENTED THOUSANDS OF CROPS
from BEING AERIALLY FERTILIZED.
and HE STUFFED A SURLY OLD DEAD GUY IN A TRUNK.
I'm NOT SAYING THAT HE ISN'T GUILTY,
and I'M NOT SAYING THAT I AM.
I'm JUST SAYING THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT HIM.
no, IT'S ABOUT OUR CLIENT,
Becky CADEN, WIFE OF BRADAN CADEN,
the MAN YOUR HANDYMAN WIDOWED
when HE DECIDED TO CROP-DUST SOMEONE'S LIVING ROOM.
did YOU CATCH HIM?
[ sighs ] THAT ONE-ARMED BITCH WAS SPEEDY.
bui CHECKED IN WITH MY PEOPLE AT THE PRISON.
you GOT "PEOPLE"? THAT'S SO NEAT.
DIYOU FIND OUT
Yes.
and WE'RE GONNA NEED SHOVELS.
narrator: EMERSON COD HAD LEARNED THREE THINGS
first, THE MAN THEY KNEW AS CONRAD FITCH
was ACTUALLY ONE LEMUEL WINEGARD,
a LOW-LEVEL EMPLOYEE OF A COMPANY CALLED ORNAN ENERGY.
second, ORNAN WAS AN ENERGY-BASED CORPORATION
known FOR SEVERAL TYPES OF TRADING
plastics, STEEL, AND INSIDER.
the LATTER COST LEMUEL HIS RIGHT HAND.
narrator: IT ALSO COST HIM HIS FREEDOM.
third, DURING HIS INCARCERATION,
LEMUEL BECAME KNOWN AS "LEFTY LEM,
a NAME GIVEN TO HIM BY HIS CELLMATE, JACKSON LUCAS,
an INFAMOUS DIAMOND THIEF,
whose FINAL ESCAPADE RESULTED IN A BURIED TREASURE
that WAS NEVER RECOVERED...
he ENDED UP IN A PRISON GRAVEYARD WITH HIS SECRET.
Oh, SO LEFTY LEM WAS A WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINAL.
that MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE.
Oh, YEAH, THANK YOU.
gonna GET PAID ONCE BY THE PILOT'S WIDOW
when WE PROVE HER HUSBAND'S DEATH WASN'T A SUICIDE
dead BODIES ALWAYS LEAD TO PAYDAYS.
Yeah, YEAH, "VODKA IN THE FREEZER.
gonna GET PAID TWICE BY THE FEDS
when THEY GIVE US THE REWARD FOR KICKING LEFTY'S ASS
back TO THE CLINK, WHERE HE BELONGS.
looking FORWARD TO THAT.
and GONNA GET PAID THRICE
by FINDING JACKSON'S BURIED BOOTY.
Hey!
[ clank! ] HEY.
come TO PAPA.
Ned: WAIT. YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVERT YOUR EYES.
there's A GOOD CHANCE HE'LL BE ON THE DEWY SIDE.
damn. I HATE DEWY.
are YOU MAD AT ME?
why WOULD I BE MAD?
for HOLDING SOMEONE'S HAND THAT WASN'T YOURS.
seriously, IN A PRISON GRAVEYARD
that's WHERE Y'ALL ARE GONNA HAVE THIS CONVERSATION?
you SHOULD, UH, BREATHE THROUGH YOUR MOUTHS.
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A LITTLE MORE EYEBALL.
emerson: JUST TOUCH THE DAMN THING.
no, WAIT. FOR WHAT?
a LITTLE DIGNITY.
Thanks.
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING! AM I BLIND?
the GOOD NEWS IS, YOU'RE NOT BLIND.
bad NEWS IS, YOU'RE DEAD.
makes BLIND SEEM LIKE A WALK IN THEARK, DOESN'T IT?
Where'd YOU BURY YOUR LOOT, JACK?
ha! WHY SHOULD I TELL YOU?
good KARMA. IT'S LIKE CURRENCY IN THE AFTERLIFE.
in THE OLD WINDMILL ON THE VonRoenn FARM,
at THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS.
how MUCH THAT WORTH?
plenty. ASK HIM ABOUT LEFTY.
did YOU TELL HIM WHERE YOU BURIED IT?
[ breathes DEEPLY ] OF COURSE I DID.
owed HIM THAT MUCH.
W-what DID YOU OWE HIM FOR?
keeping THE FIRE ALIVE.
all RIGHT, WE GOT A WINDMILL TO FIND.
narrator: CHUCK'S FIRE MAY NOT BE ALIVE,
as FAR AS HER AUNTS LILY AND VIVIAN WERE CONCERNED,
but OLIVE WAS DOING HER BEST TO REIGNITE IT.
ACKETS.
brackets.
ribbon. RIBBON.
BEJEWELER. BEJEWELER.
can I DO ONE?
maybe THE LAST ONE.
if YOU LIKE, WE COULD BEJEWEL PIDGE'S BIRDHOUSE WHEN WE'RE DONE.
PIDGE'S HOUSE IS ONLY TEMPORARY.
no SENSE IN BEJEWELING AN EMPTY HOME, IS THERE, PIDGE?
there's SOMETHING SO SAD ABOUT AN EMPTY BIRDHOUSE.
when ONE OF OUR BIRDS DIES, WE TAXIDERM IT IMMEDIATELY
put IT RIGHT BACK ON ITS PERCH.
Vivian DOES WONDERS WITH SAND AND THREAD.
and LITTLE MARBLE EYES.
it's LIKE OUR BIRDS NEVER LEFT US AT ALL.
you CAN'T PUT EVERYTHING BACK ON ITS PERCH.
it MUST HAVE BEEN ALL KINDS OF HORRIBLE FOR YOU WHEN CHARLOTTE LEFT.
she DIDN'T LEAVE.
she DIED.
and NO AMOUNT OF SAND OR THREAD
or LITTLE MARBLE EYES WILL EVER BRING HER BACK.
narrator: BUT OLIVE DIDN'T NEED SAND OR THREAD
or LITTLE MARBLE EYES TO BRING CHUCK BACK.
she NEEDED A CONFLUENCE OF EVENTS.
wing.
narrator: AND SHE WAABOUT TO GET ONE.
wing.
can I DO THE LAST BEJEWEL?
[ snaps ] I ALREADY DID IT.
what DO YOU THINK, PIDGE?
narrator: AND WHILE OLIVE, THE AUNTS, AND PIDGE
looked FORWARD TO THE NEXT STEP IN THEIR JOURNEY,
another JOURNEY HAD REACHED A DEAD END.
is SHE DEAD?
lefty LEM HAS OFFICIALLY TAKEN THE LEAD.
do YOU THINK FAKE CONRAD KILLED HER?
Ockham's RAZOR -- ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL, ?????
I USED TO BELIEVE THAT UNTIL YOU BROUGHT ME BACK FROM THE DEAD -- KIND OF SCREWS THE THEORY.
maybe YOUR FINGER NEEDS A NEW BATTERY.
here, LET ME TRY.
he DID IT. HE DID IT.
Oh! I MUST HAVE DOZED OFF AGAIN. UH, CAN I HELP YOU?
we're LOOKING FOR A WINDMILL, A VonRoenn-VARIETY WINDMILL.
Oh, THAT'S FUNNY.
a YOUNG MAN S JUST IN HERE, ASKING ABOUT THE VonRoenn MILL.
he DIDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE ONE ARM, DID HE?
as A MATTER OF FACT, HE DID.
[ sneezing ] OCKHAM'S! BLESS YOU.
thank YOU.
the WINDMILL -- WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?
retired. NO FARM, NO USE.
got SHIPPED OFF TO "NARM" SOME 20 YEARS AGO.
why DID THEY SEND IT TO NAM? DID THE VIETNAMESE NEED WINDMILLS?
N. A.R. M. -- NATIONAL AREA RETIRED MILLS.
the VonRoenn MILL HAS BEEN PRESERVED FOR AN HISTORICAL LANDMARK.
I HAVE A MAP HERE. [ CHUCKLES ]
now, THAT'S NARCOLEPTIC. NECROPHILIAC'S THE OTHER ONE.
Yeah.
narrator: ARMED WITH A NEW PLAN,
the PIE MAKER AND ASSOCIATES LEFT THE NARCOLEPTIC CURATOR TO HER DREAMS.
meanwhile, BACK IN COEUR d'COEURS,
a TINY FRIEND WAS PLANNING HER OWN ESCAPE.
olive's DISDAIN FOR CHUCK WAS SPLIT IN TWO
one FOR STEALING THE PIE MAKER'S HEART
and THE OTHER FOR BREAKING THE AUNTS'.
you KNOW YOU WANT TO READ PIDGE'S MESSAGE.
Lily WOULD BE SO DISPLEASED.
there WAS AN INCIDENT.
I READ SOMETHING THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE, AND THEN LIFE WENT HORRIBLY AWRY.
Lily NEVER FORGAVE ME.
she SAID SHE DID, BUT SHE DIDN'T.
Wow. NOW I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THAT STORY.
let's PUT PIDGE BACK INTO HER HOUSE.
PIDGE HAS LEFT THE BUILDING. I'M SORRY.
I'sorry HER EMPTY BIRDHOUSE MAKES YOU SAD.
maybe YOU COULD FILL IT WITH ALL YOUR CHARLOTTE SADNESS
and HANG IT IN A SPECIAL PLACE IN YOUR SOUL.
that's AN AWFULLY SAD BIRDHOUSE TO HAVE HANGING IN ONE'S SOUL.
hang IT SOMEPLACE YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE IT.
it WON'T ALWAYS BE SAD.
it'll BE THE HAPPIEST LITTLE BIRDHOUSE WHEN YOU'RE READY.
make A LITTLE BIRDHOUSE IN YOUR SOUL.
don't ENCOURAGE HER.
I THINK SHE LOOKS DIVINE.
son OF A BITCH.
wait! YOU FORGOT YOUR MESSAGE! PIDGE!
PIDGE, WAIT! YOU FORGOT YOUR MESSAGE!
narrator: AS THE AUNTS WATCHED OLIVE SCREAM FORELP...
help ME! PIDGE!
narrator: ...THEY CONSIDERED THEIR OWN BIRDCAGE
and WONDERED IF THEY WERE READY TO LEAVE IT BEHIND.
a FEW MILES AWAY...
looking OUT ACROSS THE FIELDS,
a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN NAMED ELSITA WAITED FOR THE MAN SHE LOVED
to MAKE HER HEART COMPLETE.
little DID SHE KNOW LEFTY LEM WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY.
what THE HELL DO YOU WANT?
I'm FROM THE PAPEN COUNTY HISTORICAL SOCIETY.
we'd LIKE TO PHOTOGRAPH THESE PREMISES FOR OUR 87th ANNUAL "MILLS OF THE WIND PAPEN COUNTY COLLECTOR'S CALENDAR.
Where's YOUR CAMERA?
it's IN THE CAR.
you're LYING.
but I'M BORED.
never MIND THE SINGING. KEEP YOUR EYE ON THAT BIRD.
you KNOW WHAT OUR PROBLEM IS.
if YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE TOUCHING THING,
I SEE IT AS MORE OF AN OBSTACLE THAN A PROBLEM.
it's A PRETTY BIG OBSTACLE.
not COMPARED TO OUR OTHER PROBLEMS.
we've GOT "OTHER PROBLEMS"?
I'm GONNA KILL MYSELF.
there's SO MUCH I'M LEARNING ABOUT YOU.
such AS?
you're ROMANTIC.
when THE MOOD STRIKES.
and YOU'RE JEALOUS WHEN THE MOOD STRIKES.
everyone's A LITTLE JEALOUS.
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE NOT A LITTLE JEALOUS, YOU'RE PROBABLY...
[ exhales RAGGEDLY ] CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT THIS?
the ANSWER TO YOUR QUERY IS "YES.
no, ACTUALLY, I-I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
I COULD LET IT GO, BUT LIKE THE CAT, IT WILL COME BACK,
which I WOULDN'T CALL ANNOYING,
but THERE'S NO REALLY GREAT WAY OF SAYING "HALF ANNOYING,
which IT IS A LITTLE BIT.
see? ISN'T THIS NEAT?
here WE WERE, THINKING ALL WE HAD WAS ONE BIG PROBLEM,
when, INCTUAL FACT, WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF LITTLE PROBLEMS
that WE GOT TO SORT OUT BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO THE BIG PROBLEM,
which MEANS WE'RE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD.
except I STILL CAN'T CATCH YOU.
Yeah, WE TAKING TWO CARS NEXT TIME.
that's A BIG AX.
Oh, I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU. I PROMISE.
this IS, UH, JUST A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.
wouldn't IT BE EASIER IF YOU PUT THE AX DOWN,
then TIED THE ROPE?
it's FUNNY -- YOU REALLY ARE A ONE-ARMED BANDIT.
your NAME'S NOT McCLAPPING, IS IT?
as IN "THE SOUND OF ONE HAND..." NO.
cause NAMES ARE DESTINY.
if YOU THINK "DWAYNE CLOGGIN
ain't GONNA GROW UP TO BE A PLUMBER,
then YOU JUST THINK AGAIN.
Oh, NO, YOU DIDN'T USE BOWS TO TIE ME UP, DID YOU?
you TAKE A HOSTAGE LIKE YOU TIE YOUR SNEAKERS.
what IS YOUR PROBLEM?
well, I WAS BORN INTO THE LIFE OF WINDMILLERY.
are YOU GONNA LISTEN, OR ARE YOU GONNA KEEP KNOCKING?
I'm LISTENING.
you WERE BORN INTO THE FE OF WINDMILLERY.
always WAITING ON THE WIND TO SHOW UP,
so YOU CAN START WORK, AND I'M NO GOOD AT WAITING.
I'm TIRED OF IT.
you SURE IT WAS THE WIND THAT YOU WERE A-WAITING FOR?
did YOU JUST SAY "A-WAITING"?
cause IF YOU ARE MIMICKING ME,
I WILL BE OUT OF THESE GIRLY BOWS
faster THAN A SNAKE THROUGH WEEDS!
I WASN'T THINKING, AND I APOLOGIZE.
it's JUST, WELL, I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND,
and I'M IN A BIT OF A RUSH.
Oh, WHERE YOU RUSHING TO?
well, I DON'T REALLY KNOW YET.
well MAYBE YOU BETTER FIGURE THAT OUT.
go BACK TO YOUR KNOCKING. [ CLEARS THROAT ]
come ON, PIDGE! YOU CAN DO IT!
not EVEN A BREEZE TO HELP POOR PIDGE,
which IS KIND OF IRONIC, GIVEN THE SURROUNDINGS.
PIDGE! COME ON!
narrator: THE PIGEON, GROWING FATIGUED WITEACH FLAP
of HER TAXIDERMIED WING,
knew SOMETHING THE OTHERS DID NOT.
[ squawks ] HER JOURNEY WAS ALMOST COMPLETE.
what WAS THAT?
it's MY BIRD!
that's MY BIRD.
what ARE YOU ON ABOUT? IT'S MY BIRD.
I'll PROVE IT. I WROTE THE NOTE.
Where's THE NOTE?
Olive: HELLO?
can I GET MY BIRD BACK, PLEASE?
your BIRD? YOUR BIRD?
Yes, MY BIRD. SHE'S A CARRIER PIGEON.
she HAS A MESSAGE, AND SHE HAS TO CARRY IT.
it's WHAT SHE DOES.
that's MY MESSAGE.
I'm ELSITA. JACKSON?
I'm LEM.
Elsa WAS MY MAMA.
jackson WAS MY PRISON BUNKMATE.
is "BUNKMATE" A EUPHEMISM FOR
not IN THIS CASE, MA'AM. [ THUNDER CRASHING ]
narrator: THERE WAS A BITTER CHILL IN THE AIR
the NIGHT JACKSON LUCAS FOUND REFUGE IN THE VonRoenn WINDML.
already FIVE DAYS ON THE LAM,
he KNEW THE POLICE WERE CLOSING IN.
to PRESERVE HIS DREAMS OF ONE DAY OWNING AN ARTALLERY IN MEXICO,
jackson DECIDED TO BURY HIS STOLEN TREASURE
in THE STAIRCASE OF THE SEEMINGLY ABANDONED PROPERTY.
his HEART STOPPED, HOWEVER,
when HE SAW AN ANGELIC CREATURE DESCENDING THE STAIRS.
her NAME WAS ELSA, AND THIS WAS HER WINDMILL.
my NAME IS ELSA.
this IS MY WINDMILL.
narrator: IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
knowing HE HAD VERY LITTLE TIME LEFT, HE KSED HER.
the NEXT MOMENT WAS NOT.
I'll WRITE YOU!
narrator: ELSA KEPT TRUE TO HER WORD.
for THE NEXT 20 YEARS,
she AND JACKSON CONTINUED THEIR LOVE AFFAIR BY CORRESPONDENCE,
letters SENT TO AND FRO
with THE HELP OF HER VIRTUALLY UNTRACEABLE CARRIER PIGEON,
until THE DAY JACKSON KNEW HE WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO KEEP HIS PROMISE.
someone ELSE WOULD HAVE TO DO IT FOR HIM.
after JACKSON DIED, I STARTED TO PLAN MY ESCAPE.
it TOOK ME TWO YEARS.
and ALL THAT TIME, I KEPT WRITING TO ELSA.
first, I WAS WRITING OUT OF LOYALTY TO THE MAN
who TAUGHT ME THE ROPES IN PRISON,
but AFTER A WHILE, I STARTED TO DEVELOP...
a CONDITION?
FOELSA -- AT LEAST, I THOUGHT IT WAS ELSA.
and MAMA MADE ME SWEAR ON HER DEATHBED
that I'D NEVER STOP WRITING TO JACKSON,
said IT WOULD BREAK HIS HEART TO LEARN THAT SHE DIED.
but EACH LETTER WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE LAST,
and I FOUND MYSELF LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM.
well, YOUR LETTERS WERE BEAUTIFUL, TOO.
what's THE BIG WHOOP?
PIDGE BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER.
Olive: HOW DID SHE LOSE HER WING?
I TOOK HER WITH ME ON THE PLANE
when I BUSTED OUT OF PRISON.
she FLEW OUT THE WINDOW AFTER TAKEOFF
and WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE PROPELLER.
Oh! PIDGE CRASHED THE PLANE.
[ chuckling ] OH, PIDGE.
what HAPPENED TO THE DIAMONDS?
together: "DIAMONDS"?
holy CRAP!
holy CRAP!
now, NOW, LET'S NOT PANIC.
I'm SURE IT'S JUST THE MAILMAN
or A WINDMILL-TO-WINDMILL SALESMAN.
let ME HANDLE IT.
narrator: AS OLIVE PEEPED THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE,
it OCCURRED TO HER THAT,
while THE CARRIER PIGEON WAS SAFE INSIDE THE WINDMILL,
the SAME COULD NOT BE SAID FOR THE SITTING DUCK
currently WAITING ON THE DOORSTEP.
narrator: THIS WAS THE MOMENT OLIVE SNOOK HAD BEEN WAITING FOR.
she NEED ONLY OPEN THE DOOR
to EXPOSE CHUCK'S DECEIT TO THE AUNTS,
and THE PIE MAKER COULD BE HERS.
it WAS EVERYTHING OLIVE WANTED, AND YET...
she KNEW THAT THE AUNTS WOULD BE TRAUMATIZED
by THE DISCOVERY THAT THE LATE CHARLOTTE CHARLES
in THAT MOMENT,
olive FELT THE ANGRY FIRE IN HER HEART
extinguished BY A LIGHT BREEZE
she HAD GROWN FOND OF LILY AND VIVIAN
and COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO HURT THEM.
afternoon, GANG!
what THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?
pie DELIVERY. TART APPLE, I BELIEVE.
narrator: WITH THOSE TWO WORDS, CHUCK KNEW.
her AUNTS WERE INSIDE.
if YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, AND I THINK YOU DO,
you'll GIVE ME TWO MINUTES.
Why? WHAT FOR? OKAY.
goody, THEN.
who WAS IT?
wrong MILL.
must HAPPEN A LOT AROUND HERE, HUH?
anyway, I FEEL JUST AWFUL
that WE'VE TAKEN UP SO MUCH OF YOUR DAY.
we SHOULD REALLY BE GOING.
uh, DO YOU MIND IF WE USE THE BACK DOOR?
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A PEEK AT YOUR GARDEN ON THE WAY OUT.
Thanks! BYE!
do YOU REMEMBER BEFORE,
when I TOLD YOU ALL THE THINGS I'D LEARNED ABOUT YOU?
jealous, ROMANTIC, JEALOUS.
I FELT I HAD TO SAY IT TWICE.
right. WELL, NOW MIGHT BE A REALLY GOOD TIME
for YOU TO WRITE DOWN ALL THE THINGS YOU LEARNED ABOUT ME.
Why?
well, THAT WAY, IF STUFF HAPPENS...
just REMEMBER THE LIST.
emerson: TIME'S UP.
well, NOW, WASN'T THAT A NICE OUTING?
I COULD USE A DRINK.
young PEOPLE DEPRESS LILY BECAUSE SHE'S AFRAID OF DYING.
narrator: AS LILY WONDERED WHETHER SHE WAS AFRAID OF DYING
or SIMPLY MISSED FEELING ALIVE
she ALLOWED HERSELF ONE DEEP BREATH OF FRESH COUNTRY AIR.
I DON'T THINK WE'VE BEEN OUT NCE -- CHARLOTTE?!
no NEED TO YELL HER NAME.
I THINK HEAVEN'S CLOSER THAN WE THINK.
I AGREE.
hand UP!
lemuel, I'LL WRITE YOU!
narrator: THE PIE MAKER AND THE GIRL HE CALLED "CHUCK
marveled AT LOVE'S POWER CONQUER ALL OBSTACLES
distance AND TIME...
hardship AND PAIN...
a LACK OF RECIPROCATION...
even DEATH.
your HUSBAND WAS A GREAT PILOT.
he DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF. A PIGEON DID, BY ACCIDENT.
narrator: WITH PIDGE'S HELP,
the LONG-DISTANCE LOVE AFFAIR OF LEFTY AND ELSITA CONTINUED TO SOAR.
while SOME OBSTACLES MAY NEVER DISAPPEAR...
care TO DANCE?
hmm. YES, PLEASE.
narrator: ...YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND A WAY TO WORK AROUND THEM.
you CAUGHT ME.
he COULD TOUCH DEAD THINGS AND BRING THEM BACK TO LIFE.
but HE COULD ONLY BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE FOR ONE MINUTE.
any LONGER ANDOMEONE ELSE HAD TO DIE.
and THERE WAS ONE MORE THING HE HAD TO LEARN
first TOUCH, LIFE.
second TOUCH, DEAD AGAIN FOREVER.
but AS YOUNG NED GREW INTO THE PIE MAKER,
this GIFT PROVED TO BE MOST USEFUL
in THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF HIS CHILDHOOD SWEETHEART, CHARLOTTE CHARLES.
are YOU IN LOVE WITH HER? YOU ONLY GOT A MINUTE. I KNOW.
60 SECONDS. I KNOW.
what IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE DEAD?
you CAN'T TOUCH ME. SO A KISS IS OUT OF THE QUESTION?
CHUCK: YOU TOUCH MURDER VICTIMS, YOU ASK WHO KILLED THEM.
you TOUCH THEM AGAIN, THEY GO BACK TO BEING DEAD,
and THEN YOU COLLECT THE REWARD?
that's IT IN A NUTSHELL.
you SAVED ME!
it WAS A FRIENDLY PRESSION OF INNOCENT GRATITUDE.
what's GOTTEN INTO YOU?
what's GOTTEN INTO YOU?
narrator: AT THIS VERY MOMENT, AT THE LONGBOROUGH SCHOOL FOR BOYS,
young NED WAS 9 YEARS, 41 WEEKS, 14 HOURS, AN3 MINUTES OLD
and EXHAUSTED...
for, DESPITE THE ENDLESS WAKING HOURS SPENT ASSURING HIMSELF
that HIS HEART WAS ON THE MEND,
Ned DISCOVERED THE TRUTH IN HIS SLEEP.
sadly, NOT A SINGLE NIGHT HAD PASSED SINCE THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER
that HE DIDN'T DREAM OF HER COMING BACK TO HIM.
realizing HE COULDN'T RUSH HIS HEART INTO HEALING,
he CONCOCTED A PLAN......TO RECONNECT WITH HIS MOTHER IN A WAY THAT ONLY HE COULD.
for YOUNG NED WASN'T LIKE THE OTHER CHILDREN
or THE OTHER ADULTS, FOR THAT MATTER,
which, IN THIS CASE, DELIGHTED HIM...
briefly.
although YOUNG NED KNEW HE COULDN'T TASTE THE PIE,
lest THE FRUIT ROT AGAIN, HE DIDN'T CARE.
the MERE SMELL OF IT MADE HIM FEEL, IF ONLY FOR AN HOUR,
exactly LIKE HE WANTED TO FEEL
safe AND WARM AND LOVED
which IS WHY HE BECAME...
the PIE MAKER...
who, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, WAS PLANTING FLOWERS
to MAKE CHUCK FEEL AS SAFE AND WARM AND LOVED
as HE ONCE DID.
sue BEE.
who BEE?
n beI'M REFERRING TO THE HONEY
the STORE-BOUGHT KIND,
the KIND I WILL PURCHASE BY THE GALLON FOR YOU.
honey YOU DON'T WORK FOR IS NEVER AS SWEET.
Oh, LOOK.
there's A FANTASTIC ROOFTOP
for THE HONEY-HARVESTING EXPANSION.
let's NOT PLANT FLOWERS WAY OVER THERE.
you DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH BUILDING.
I KNOW IT'S NOT THIS ONE.
and IN THE INTEREST OF OPERATION URBAN HONEY PIONEER,
I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP THE OPERATION CONTAINED.
comfortably CONTAINED.
comfortable IN A GOOD WAY, LIKE IT'S USUALLY USED.
I'm CONCERNED FOR THE BEES.
we SHOULD KEEP THE FLOWERS CLOSE SO THEY WILL FEEL SAFE.
actually, BEES HAVE AN INCREDIBLE SENSE OF SMELL.
so IF WE KEEP DOING OUR JOB D PLANTING THE FLOWERS,
the BEES WILL DO THEIRS AND FIND THEM.
why DO WE NEED SO MUCH HONEY, ANYWAY?
it's A SURPRISE.
surprise" HAS NEVER BEEN A VERY GOOD WORD FOR ME.
well, YOU'LL LIKE THIS ONE.
and JUST SO YOU KNOW,
the HONEYBEE HAS TO VISIT HUNDREDS OF BLOSSOMS
before IT HAS ENOUGH NECTAR TO TAKE BACK TO THE HIVE,
so THE MORE FLOWERS, THE MERRIER THE BEES.
narrator: A BROKENHEARTED OLIVE SNOOK
found HERSELF NAVIGATING A MINEFIELD OF HER OWN MAKING.
this IS WHAT IT IS, ISN'T IT?
unless THAT'S NOT A ROLLING PIN UNDER YOUR APRON.
sorry.
Oh! ISN'T IT GREAT WE CAN JOKE?
now THAT WE KNOW THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON BETWEEN US AND NEVER WAS,
it CAN BE FUNNY.
I BET THIS SORT OF THING HAPPENS ALL THE TIME BETWEEN ADULTS.
mixed ROMANTIC MESSAGES.
in NO TIME, WE'LL BE LOOKING BACK
and LAUGHING TILL WE WET THE RUG...
which WE'LL THEN WANT TO SHAMPOO.
a COUPLE TIMES, POSSLY THREE,
depeing ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN DRINKING.
Yeah.
maybe I SHOULD WEAR A BELL.
actually -- I'M NOT WEARING A BELL.
Narror: CHUCK CONTINUED TO KEEP THE SECRET INGREDIENT OF HER PIES SECRET.
not EVEN OLIVE SNOOK KNEW THE BAKED GOODS SHE DELIVERED
contained HOMEOPATHIC MOOD ENHANCERS
meant TO PRY CHUCK'S AUNTS OUT OF THEIR FUNK.
so, HAVE THEY BEEN IN A GOOD MOOD?
my AUNTS? NO, THAT'S PLURAL, AND NOT ALL OF THEM GOOD.
okay. MAYBE IT'S TIME TO GO TO PHASE TWO.
have WE BEEN IN PHASE ONE THIS WHOLE TIME? MM-HMM.
how MANY PHASES ARE THERE?
four THAT I KNOW OF, BUT MAYBE FIVE.
right NOW, WE'RE AT PHASE TWO,
which MEANS WE NEED TO GET THEM BACK IN THE WATER.
it's LIKE OXYGEN FOR THEM.
because THEY'RE FORMER MERMAIDS.
only PROFESSIONALLY, NOT MYTHOLOGICALLY SPEAKING.
Oh, I KN ALL ABOUT THEIR MERMAIDNESS.
what ARE THESE? CUPCAKE PANS?
surprise.
it's THE PIE HOLE, NOT THE CUPCAKE HOLE.
but IT'S NOT A CUPCAKE. IT'S A CUP-PIE.
a SINGLE-SERVE PIE WITH HONEY
my HONEY -- BAKED INTO THE CRUST.
and SINCE IT'S STILL A PIE
it COULD BE SERVED IN THE PIE HOLE, BY DEFINITION.
I'm A PURIST.
I LIKE THAWE ONLY SERVE TRADITIONAL PIES IN THE PIE HOLE,
not THESE HYBRIDS.
you KNOW, YOU COULD DO WITH LOOSENING UP A BIT.
I DON'T DO LOOSE. I PREFER TIGHTLY WOUND.
not SHAPELESS WITH EXTRA ROOM FOR SURPRISES.
I WAS A SURPRISE.
you MADE ROOM FOR ME.
some.
Yeah, I MADE ROOM.
a WHOLE ROOFTOP FULL OF ROOM FOR YOU AND YOUR BEES.
I KNOW, AND I LOVE IT.
I'm NOT QUASIMODO IN THE BELL TOWER.
Quasimodo WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER OFF IF HE STAYED IN HIS BELL TOWER
where IT WAS SAFE AND COMFORTABLE, AND HE HAD HIS BELL.
I'm NOT SURE QUASIMODO WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.
quasi WANTED ADVENTURE. QUASI WANTED TO SEE THE WORLD.
quasi WANTED CUP-PIES.
narrator: PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR EMERSON COD
was ENJOYING THE LATEST ISSUE OF KNIT WIT MAGAZINE,
his LITERARY OUTLET FOR KNITTING HUMOR,
when HE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL
from THE MOTHER OF ONE ANITA GRAY.
narrator: THE FACTS WERE THESE
Anita GRAY -- 22 YEARS, 11 WEEKS, 2 DAYS, 9 HOURS, AND 33 MINUTES OLD WAS TAKING A PRIVATE TUTORIAL IN OLFACTORY SCIENCE WHEN SHE EXPERIENCED AN EPIPHANY.
and THE EPIPHANY WAS THAT HER INSTRUCTOR,
Napoleon LeNEZ, WAS A GENIUS.
it WAS AN EPIPHANY
Napoleon LeNEZ HAD HIMSELF EXPERIENCED
many, MANY YEARS EARLIER.
he SHOWED HER HOW OLFACTORY CUES COULD TRIGGER MEMORIES,
release FLOODS OF ENDORPHINS AND PHEROMONES,
and CAUSE BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTIONS
that DEEPLY IMPACTED THE WAY PEOPLE BEHAVE AND FEEL.
using THE ELL OF UNFILTERED CIGARETTES
to EVOKE FOND MEMORIES OF HER GRANDMOTHER,
he OPENED HER EYES AND HEART THROUGH HER NOSE.
so SHE DEVOTED HER LIFE TO HIS WORK.
with HIS NEW APPRENTICE, ANITA, BY HIS SIDE,
LeNEZ CREATED A SELF-HELP GUIDE
for THOSE WHO WISHED TO NOT ONLY HARNESS THEIR PAST
but TO INSPIRE AND MOLD THEIR FUTURE
via THE POWER OF SMELL.
Anita DIDN'T LIVE TO SEE THE BOOK PUBLISHED.
while WORKING ALE,
she WAS KILLED BY A MYSTERIOUS EXPLOSION IN LeNEZ'S LAB.
exactly WHAT CAUSED THAT EXPLOSION
seemed TO BE A QUESTION ONLY ANITA GRAY COULD ANSWER.
that IS PUNGENT.
Yeah, PUNGENT LIKE FRIED CHICKEN GRILLED ON A BED OF HAIR.
well, WHAT YOU WAITING ON?
who's SMOKING?
you.
how RUDE OF ME. I'M DREADFULLY SORRY.
this CAN'T BE GOOD FOR YOUR LUNGS.
Anita, YOU HAVE LESS THAN A MINUTE TO IMPART ANY LAST WORDS.
on THE SUBJECT OF WHAT CAUSED THAT EXPLOSION.
EXPLOSION"? THAT'S WHAT THAT FLASH WAS.
do YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING BEFORE THE FLASH?
the SMELL OF MY GRANDMA'S UNFILTERED CIGARETTES.
narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, ANITA'S DESIRE TO EXPERIENCE
another OLFACTORY-INDUCED MEMORY
of HER BELOVED GRANDMOTHER, LONG DEAD FROM CANCER,
led HER TO SNEAK A LOOK
at THE ONE AND ONLY ADVANCED COPY OF LeNEZ'S BOOK,
a BOOK THAT WAS MEANT FOR HIS NOSE ONLY.
this WAS CLEARLY A CASE OF...
death BY SCRATCH-AND-SNIFF?
so LeNEZ DIDN'T WANT YOU LOOKING AT THAT BOOK?
he DIDN'T WANT ANYONE LOOKING AT IT YET.
Oh, NO. WAS I BEING PUNISHED FOR PEEKING? IS GOD MAD AT ME?
no. NO, GOD IS NOT MAD AT YOU.
somebody's MAD AT SOMEBODY.
somebody's MAD AT NAPOLEON LeNEZ.
that DAMN BOOK WAS BOOBTRAPPED.
Oh, 5 SECONDS.
am I GON SEE MY GRANDMA NOW? AS FARS YOU KNOW.
that's A YES.
death BY SCRATCH-AND-SNIFF
what THE HELL HAPPENED TO PEOPLE SHOOTING EACH OTHER WITH GUNS?
narrator: ANXIOUS TO SNIFF OUT MORE INFORMATION,
scratch-and-sniff AUTHOR, IN HIS SUITE ABOVE THE CITY
and IMMEDIATELY FOUND THEMSELVES IN AN ALARMING SITUATION.
do NOT BE ALARMED BY THIS SITUATION.
you TTER OPEN UP THIS DOOR!
please EXCUSE MY DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURE.
my NASAL GLANDS ARE EXTREMELY DELICATE.
FELICITATIONS.
FELICI-WHAT?
we're HERE ABOUT YOUR ASSISTANT -- DON'T SPEAK.
a SMELL TELLS SO MUCH MORE.
cigars, AFTERSHAVE,
antacids, CASH... AND YARN.
U're A KNITTING DETECTIVE.
and YOU.
flour, FRUIT,
and A SUBTLE WAFT OF MUSKY PHEROMONES TRIGGERED BY
you...
the GIRL SMELLING OF HONEY AND...
death.
which DOESN'T SURPRISE ME
the ANIMALIC-CHARGED MOLECULES USED IN YOUR PERFUME
are ALSO FOUND IN DECOMPOSING BODIES AND FECES.
Oh, I'M NOT WEARING ANY PERFUME.
I'm NOT WEARING JUST ANY PERFUME.
precisely MY POINT. WHY SETTLE FOR LESS?
in ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE, WE STRIVE FOR PERFECTION.
why NOT APPLY THOSE PRINCIPLES TO WHAT WE SMELL?
Yeah, YEAH.
LeNEZ, LOOK, WE'RE HERE ABOUT THAT SCRATCH-AND-SNIFF.
your BOOK WAS A BOMB.
who ARE YOU TO CRITICIZE MY LIFE'S WORK?
your BOOK WAS A BOMB.
it EXPLODED.
narrator: THE KILLER HAD USED A UNIQUE EXPLOSIVE ON LeNEZ'S ADVANCED COPY OF THE BOOK,
a CHEMICAL MIXED WITH AN OXIDIZING AGENT TO CREATE A FIERY CHAIN REACTION.
are THEY STILL GONNA PUBLISH YOUR BOOK?
Anita WOULD HAVE WANTED IT THAT WAY,
although I'M SURE SHE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A VERSION WHERE SHE LIVED.
still, SHE WAS THRILLED WHEN MY PUBLISHER BUMPED UP
the RELEASE DATE OF "SMELL OF SUCCESS.
when DID THEY BUMP UP YOUR "SMELL"?
two WEEKS AGO.
follow YOUR NOSE, MR. COD,
and IT WILL LEAD YOU TO THIS DEVIANT'S DOORSTEP.
when WE HARNESS THE POWER OF SMELL,
we BECOME BLOODHOUNDS OF OUR OWN DESIRES.
smell IT, CRAVE IT, OWN IT.
I CAN WEAR THEM? YOU MEAN IT? ON MY FEET?
unless YOU'RE CURSED WITH A SIXTH TOE.
you're NOT, ARE YOU?
no, NO. FIVE FINGERS, FIVE TOES.
us SNOOKS ARE BORING THAT WAY.
I HAD A COUSIN WITH A THIRD NIPPLE.
he'd LET YOU SEE IT FOR A DOLLAR.
how FASCINATING.
and A BARGAIN, TOO.
this IS A DREAM COME TRUE.
I HOPE THIS DOESN'T FREAK YOU OUT,
but I USED TO BE A BIG DARLING MERMAID DARLINGS ENTHUSIAST.
I HAD THE TAIL AND THE CLAMSHELL BRA.
just LIKE THIS ONE.
did YOU SHOW THAT OFF FOR A DOLLAR?
I BET YOU MISS YOUR FANS.
I KNOW I WOULD
all THE ADORATION, ALL THE LOVE.
doesn't ALL THIS PARAPHERNALIA MAKE YOU WANT TO GET BACK IN THE POOL?
have NO REASON TO.
we CANCELLED OUR COMEBACK TOUR.
but LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF.
imagine THE MONEY YOU'LL MAKE FROM MERCHANDISING ALONE.
what's THIS?
that BELONGED TO CHARLOTTE.
it WAS HER MOTHER'S.
whatever HAPPENED TO CHARLOTTE'S MOTHER?
she DIED.
narrator: AND WITH THAT, LILY WENT TO HER DARK PLACE.
you WANT IT? TAKE IT.
I DON'T CARE IF I EVER GET IN THE WATER AGAIN.
for THE LOVE OF KUKLA, FRAN, AND OLLIE,
rent THE GIRL A HAND TRUCK AND GET THIS CRAP OUT OF HERE.
I NEED A PIECE OF PIE.
Ned: DO YOU REALLY THINK PEOPLE CAN CHANGE THEIR LIVES
by SMELLING THE RIGHT SMELL?
if SO, I'M GONNA GET ME SOME CH POTPOURRI.
I TALKED TO THAT PUBLISHER.
LeNEZ'S BOOK WAS BUMPED UP THE RELEASE SCHEDULE PRIOR TO ANITA GRAY'S MURDER.
so...
so IF LeNEZ'S BOOK GOT MOVED UP THE SCHEDULE,
somebody ELSE'S BOOK GOT MOVED OFF.
find THE BOOK THAT WAS FORMERLY ON THIS SCHEDULE
that IS NO LONGER ON THIS SCHEDULE,
and YOU'LL FIND AN ANGRY AUTHOR WITH A MOTIVE TO KILL.
look.
a SLICE OF PIE IS TOO MUCH FOR SOME CUSTOMERS.
a CUP-PIE WOULD BE PERFECT.
see THAT? SEE WHAT YOU JUST DID JUST NOW?
you INTERRUPTED OUR CONVERSATION WITH YOUR CUP-PIE CHATTER
when I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A CUP-PIE IS,
which MEANS I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT A CUP-PIE IS.
Oh, I'M SORRY.
a CUP-PIE IS A SINGLE-SERVE PIE WITH A HONEY-BAKED CRUST.
doesn't THAT SOUND GOOD?
sounds DELICIOUS, BUT WE DON'T SERVE THEM HERE.
am I SERIOUSLY THE FIRST PERSON TO QUESTION YOUR AVERSION TO CHANGE?
what ABOUT YOUR EX-GIRLFRIENDS?
emerson DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT ANY OF THIS.
I MUST ADMIT, I AM CURIOUS.
hell, BEFORE DEAD GIRL CAME ALONG,
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU LIKED, OR IF YOU LIKED,
or IF YOU HAD ANYTHING TO LIKE WITH.
for ALL I KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
who WAS BORN WITH BOTH BUT DIDN'T USE EITHER.
I've HAD GIRLFRIENDS,
but THERE WERE ALWAYS EXTRANEOUS FACTORS.
what KIND OF EXTRANEOUS FACTORS?
you KNOW, WE, UM...
grew APART AND...LOST INTEREST,
had INTIMATE RELATIONS ON A BEARSKIN RUG.
Oh, NO, DID IT...
it DID ENOUGH TO BE UPSETTING.
come ON. W-WHAT'S ALL THIS?
girl BUSINESS. BONDING.
phase TWO HAS EXPERIENCED A HICCUP.
the KIND OF HICCUP THAT GOES AWAY
if YOU HAVE A GLASS OF WATER OR HOLD YOUR BREATH?
no, THE KIND OF HICCUP THAT KEEPS YOU UP FOR DAYS ON END TILL YOU GO CRAZY
and YOU GIVE AWAY ALL YOUR CHERISHED MERMAID MEMENTOS
and REFUSE TO GET BACK IN THE POOL AGAIN.
Oh, NO. HAVE THEY BEEN EATING THE PIE?
Chuck, A SLICE OF PIE CAN'T SOLVE ALL THEIR PROBLEMS.
we JUST NEED TO GIVE THEM STRONGER PIE
and GIVE THEM A LITTLE PUSH...INTO THE WATER.
but I HAVE BEEN PUSHING. YOU NEED TO PUSH HARDER.
narrator: THE PIE MAKER FEARED CHUCK AND OLIVE BONDING
was LIKE A CHEMICAL ACCELERANT BONDING WITH AN OXIDIZING AGENT.
an EXPLOSION WAS BOUND TO POP UP.
POP-UPS!
what?
pop-up BOOKS! I LOVE POP-UP BOOKS.
and IF THE SACRED CASH COW THAT I WORSHIP IS MOOING DOWN ON US...
our KILLER LIKES POP-UPS, TOO.
narrator: EMERSON AND NED PURSUED PINNING DOWN THE POP-UP AUTHOR.
are YO UH, CHAS SPIELMAN, AUTHOR OF "POP-UP PIN-UP"?
that's ME.
are YOU HERE FOR A SNEAK PEEK,
or SHOULD I SAY PEEP, OF MY LATEST BOOK?
I HEARD THIS BOOK WAS CANCELED.
only TEMPORARILY. I'M STILL WORKING ON THAT.
this DON'T LOOK LIKE NO POP-UP BOOK I HAD AS A CHILD.
pop-ups AREN'T JUST FOR CHILDREN.
my POP-UPS ARE DESIGNED R THEIR ORIGINAL AUDIENCE.
perverts?
mature CONNOISSEURS OF ART.
emerson: OR HOMICIDAL MANIACS WITH RUDIMENTARY READING SKILLS.
the NEW PATRIOT'S POP-UP BOOK
a THREE-DIMENSIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL "TELLING YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT BUILDING BOMBS OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES.
pop-up PALACE APPEALS TO AN UNUSUAL DEMOGRAPHIC.
any INSTRUCTIONS IN HERE ON HOW TO BUILD A SCRATCH-AND-SNIFF BOMB?
is THIS ABOUT THE ATTEMPT ON NAPOLEON LeNEZ?
word TRAVELS FAST IN LITERARY CIRCLES.
well, HIS BOOK DID BUMP "POP-UP PIN-UP" OFF THE SCHEDULE.
seems LIKE A GOOD-ENOUGH MOTIVE TO BLOW SOMEBODY UP.
and CLEARLY, YOU HAVE THE MEANS.
who WOULD PUBLISH A BOOK ON HOW TO KILL SOMEBODY,
then KILL SOMEBODY THEY KNEW
using A METHOD THEY PUBLISHED IN THE BOOK?
Yeah, WELL, I'M KEEPING THIS BOOK AS EVIDENCE.
and THESE, TOO.
so, YOU DIDN'T WANT LeNEZ DEAD?
I MAY BE PETTY, BUT I'M NOT THAT PETTY.
besides, THE PUBLISHER MOVED LeNEZ'S BOOK
from A PRIME HOLIDAY SPOT TO NO-MAN'S-LAND.
if YOU ASK ME, HIS BOOK WASN'T BUMPED, IT WAS DUMPED.
Oh, IT SMELLS LIKE FAMILY HOUR AT THE PUBLIC POOL.
Oh, NO. THAT'S NOT THE PIE.
it's CHLORINE TABLETS.
aunt LILY USED TO SAY IT SMELLS LIKE BOTTLED SUNSHINE.
well, IF IT CAME IN A BOTTLE, AUNT LILY WOULD LIKE IT.
see, I'VE BEEN READING THIS REALLY GOOD SELF-HELP BOOK.
it's ABOUT THE POWER OF SMELL.
I THOUGHT WE'D TRY IT -- SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COMBINE PIE HAPPINESS WITH THE HAPPINESS OF CHLORINE.
you KNOW, I READ A SELF-HELP BOOK ONCE
SAMSONIZED
how TO GROW YOUR HAIR TO BECOME A MORE POWERFUL YOU.
two WEEKS LATE AND I WAS BALD AS A BABY'S BEHIND.
looks LIKE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO READ IT.
what's THE HAPS, PAPS? ANY LUCK ON THE CASE?
first OF ALL, I AIN'T YOUR PAPS.
PAPS" HAS A LADY CONNOTATION.
and SECOND OF ALL, THIS AIN'T NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
Yuck.
there's SOMETHING -- SOMETHING STUCK IN THERE.
no, THEY DIDN'T.
narrator: THE INTENT OF THE WARNING WAS OBVIOUS.
Olive: "U CAN'T SAVE LeNEZ"?
narrator: SOMEONE WANTED TO MAKE A STINK.
decay...
a TINGE OF RUSTED IRON
harsh BUT SPIKY, WITH A SULFURIC EDGE.
this LOATHSOME OMEN CAME UP FROM THE SEWER,
which MEANS IT COULD HAVE ONLY COME FROM ONE MAN
narrator: OSCAR VIBENIUS AND NAPOLEON LeNEZ
were LAB PARTNERS AND THE BEST OF FRIENDS,
until THEIR DIVERGENT OLFACTION THEORIES TORE THEM APART.
Oscar FAVORED THE WILD, UNFEERED SMELLS OF THE NATURAL WORLD,
believing THAT PEOPLE COULDN'T APPRECIATE THE GOOD SMELLS IN LIFE
without SMELLING THE BAD.
LeNEZ BELIEVED THAT BECAUSE SMELL
has A POWERFUL EFFECT ON HUMAN BEHAVIOR,
humans SHOULD SURROUND THEMSELVES WITH ONLY GOOD, CAREFULLY CONTROLLED ODORS.
over TIME, THEIR RIVALRY GREW UNTIL NEITHER MAN COULD STAND THE OTHER.
each RETREATED TO THE WORLDS THEY FOUND MOST COMFORTABLE
one ABOVEGROUND...
and ONE BELOW.
there WAS REALLY NOTHING I COULD DO.
it's SAD, BUT OSCAR WOULD DO ANYTHING
to PREVENT MY THEORIES FROM BEING PUBLISHED.
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE COULD BE?
there WERE RUMORS.
some CLAIM THAT HE COMMITTED SUICIDE.
others WERE CONVINCED THAT HE ENDED UP IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION,
only TO BE PUT BACK ON THE STREET BY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION.
I HEARD TALES OF OSCAR ROAMING THE SEWERS,
haunting THEM,
a SOURED HUSK OF WHO HE ONCE WAS.
but THEN SOMEONE RECENTLY TOLD ME HE WORKED FOR THE DWP,
so THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHERE SOME OF THOSE RUMORS CAME FROM.
look CAREFULLY, LADIES.
this...Is YOUR FUTURE.
is IT VODKA?
water.
as IN RUSSIAN FOR VODKA?
as IN ENGLISH FOR H2O.
VIVIAN: LILY DOESN'T BELIEVE IN WATER ANYMORE.
she THINKS IT'S A WASTE OF A PERFECTLY GOOD TUMBLER.
how ABOUT NOW?
chlorine.
Lily USED TO SAY IT REMINDED HER OF BOTTLED SUNSHINE.
now IT REMINDS ME OF CHILDREN WITHOUT BLADDER CONTROL.
why, LILY... IS THAT A SMILE?
just GAS.
narrator: SO, SHE SWALLOWED HER HAPPINESS
and RETREATED TO THE SAFETY OF HER USUAL DESPONDENCY.
as LILS GAS PASSED,
our DETERMINED HEROES FOLLOWED THE TUBE SOCK
to ITS OWN FOUL ORIGIN.
we're REALLY WALKING AROUND DOWN HERE.
this IS WHERE HE ROAMS... AND HAUNTS.
see, Y'ALL GONNA MAKE ME GET MY SHOES WET.
there's HIS TOOLBOX.
looks LIKE HE'S WORKING ON THIS THICK, YELLOW HOSE.
well, LET'S FOLLOW THE YELLOW, THICK HOSE.
follow THE YELLO THICK HOSE.
I SURE HOPE THERE'S METHANE DOWN HERE, 'CAUSE THE SKINNY ONES ARE FIRST TO GO.
CHUCK: HELLO?
he AIN'T DOWN HERE. AIN'T NOBODY DOWN HERE.
we BEEN LOOKING AROUND HERE FOR HOURS FOLLOWING DEAD GIRL,
and NOW WE'RE LOST.
we're NOT LOST. WE'RE FOLLOWING THE YELLOW, THICK HOSE.
what ABOUT ALL THOSE RUMORS
the ONES ABOUT OSCAR ENDING UP IN A MENTAL INSTITUTION
or, WORSE YET, BECOMING A MODERN-DAY MONSTER?
there ARE NO SUCH THING AS MONSTERS.
what ABOUT CHUD?
cannibalistic HUMANOID UNDERGROUND DWELLERS.
they feed on the homeless and hapless passersby.
I HEAR THEY'RE PACK HUNTERS.
Yeah, WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I SURE HOPE THEY LIKE WHITE MEAT.
Thanks.
where ARE WE, EXACTLY?
we SHOULD BE IN LeNEZ'S NEIGHBORHOOD.
in FACT...
we're RIGHT UNDERNEATH HIS APARTMENT BUILDING.
you BETTER RUN!
department OF WATER AND POWER EMPLOYEE OSCAR VIBENIUS ????
author OF COMING SELF-HELP OPUS "SMELL OF SUCCESS.
presales OF THE BOOK HAVE SKYROCKETED
since THE FIRST EXPLOSION,
which CAUSED THE DEATH OF ANITA GRAY,
a FORMER ASSOCIATE OF MR. LeNEZ.
I MAY BE CLEAN, BUTY MIND IS IN THE GUTTER.
what? DIRTY THOUGHTS? LASCIVIOUS PININGS?
in THE SEWER GUTTER WITH OSCAR VIBENIUS.
Oh, THAT GUTTER. HE'S NOT A VERY GOOD KILLER.
he KEEPS BLOWING THINGS UP, BUT NEVER WHO HE WANTS TO BLOW UP.
Yeah, HE'S CERTAINLY NO SHARPSHOOTER.
maybe HE JUST LIKES THE ATTENTION.
I BET HE'S REAL PISSY THAT NAPOLEON LeNEZ IS GETTING ALL THE ATTENTION.
Oscar's ABOUT TO GET ALL THE ATTENTION HE WANTS.
sorry. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE HERE.
how'd YOU GET CLEANED UP SO QUICK?
I GOT CLEANED UP IN EXACTLY THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO GET CLEANED UP.
you're JUST SLOW.
so, WHY'S OSCAR GETTING ALL THE ATTENTION?
LeNEZ'S ABOUT TO MAKE A STATEMENT,
and AS WITNESSES TO THE MOST RECENT ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE,
we ALSO HAVE TO MAKE A STATEMENT,
and THAT "WE" DON'T INCLUDE YOU.
why NOT? I WITNESSED THE LATEST ATTEMPT.
that DON'T CHANGE THE FACT
that THERE'S A GRAVE OUT THERE THAT YOU SUPPOSED TO BE IN.
what YOU GONNA TELL PEOPLE WHEN THEY ASK WHO YOU ARE?
I'll SAY THAT I'M SOMEBODY I'M NOT.
Hey, SOMEBODY, CAN I SEE SOME I. D?
well, I'LL SMILE, AND I'LL BE POLITE,
and I'LL SAY, "OH, I'M SORRY. I FORGOT MY PURSE, AND I'VE GOT NO POCKETS.
well, HEY, SOMEBODY, "SEE, NOW I'M GONNA NEED TO SEE SOME I. D.
on ACCOUNT OF YOU LOOK JUST LIKE THAT DEAD GIRL
okay, IF THAT HAPPENS, I'LL SAYING SOMETHING LIKE, "WHAT IS THIS, A POLICE STATE?
if I EVER SAY THAT, IT MEANS I'M HAVING A PANIC ATTACK.
no NEED TO PANIC 'CAUSE SHE AIN'T GOING.
you AIN'T GOING.
just WANTED TO...TRY IT ON BEFORE I GAVE IT BACK.
while I HAVE YOU HERE, WOULD YOU TAKE MY PHOTO?
Yeah, SURE.
you SHOULD KNOW THAT OPERATION FIN FOLLIES IS UP AND FLAPPING.
the MERMAIDS ARE SINGING.
but ARE THEY SWIMMING?
well, THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT SWIMMING,
but THEIR HEARTS ARE SINGING.
at LEAST ONE OF THEIR HEARTS. THE OTHER ONE'S STALLING.
psychologically, NOT CARDIOLOGILLY.
Lily. THAT'S THE ONE.
man, HER NUT DON'T CRACK.
let's DO ONE FOR 4th OF JULY.
her NUT DOES CRACK. I KNOW IT DOES.
I CRACKED IT BEFORE.
I've SEEN THAT CRACK.
thought MAYBE YOU'D WANT THIS.
my AUNTS GAVE IT TO YOU?
practically FORCED IT ON ME.
I THINK IT'S A BIG FIRST STEP FOR THEM, EMOTIOLLY.
what ARE THE STAGES OF DEATH?
something, SOMETHING, SOMETHING, SOMETHING, ACCEPTANCE.
Yeah, UM... THOSE ARE THE STAGES.
no, NO.
we're NOT AT THAT STAGE OF OUR FRIENDSHIP YET.
please DON'T CRY IN FRONT OF ME.
don't DO IT. DON'T YOU DO IT!
I'm NOT GOING TO.
you BETTER NOT.
I WON'T.
you DID IT.
would YOU LIKE A PIECE OF PIE?
woman: WHAT CAN SMELL DO FOR YOU?
if YOU'RE NAPOLEON LeNEZ, AUTHOR OF "SMELL OF SUCCESS,
the CONTROVERSIAL NEW GUIDE TO SATISFACTION THROUGH OLFACTION,
smell CAN GET YOU KILLED.
Napoleon, HOW MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE THERE BEEN ON YOUR LIFE?
right NOW, THERE'S ONLY BEEN TWO, CAROL.
and YOU'RE ANTICIPATING MORE? I DON'T KNOW.
seems LIKE SOMEBODY OUT THERE
doesn't WANT MY BOOK TOUCHING THE WORLD.
simply PURGING YOUR LIFE OF THE BAD SMELLS
and FOCUSING ON THE GOOD.
it's ALL THERE IN MY BOOK, "SMELL OF SUCCESS.
but IT'S NOT JUST SOMEBODY.
you KNOW THE MAN WHO MADE TWO ATTEMPTS ON YOUR LIFE.
Yes, I DO.
his NAME IS OSCAR VIBENIUS.
here WITH US NOW IS AN EYEWITNESS
to OSCAR VIBENIUS' ATTEMPT ON YOUR LIFE EARLIER TODAY.
sir, TELL US WHAT YOU SAW.
good EVENING, CAROL.
let ME PREFACE MY STATEMENT
by SAYING THAT MY NAME IS ERSON COD.
I'm A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.
if YOU NEED TO REACH ME,
my TELEPHONE NUMBER IS KLONDIKE 5-0155.
that's KLONDIKE 5-0155.
I've BEEN INVESTIGATING THE ANITA GRAY MURDER.
she WAS TAKEN MUCH TOO SOON.
get A LOAD OF MUGGY McHAMBONE. HAWKING HIS WARES.
he JUST GAVE OUT HIS PHONE NUMBER ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.
look. THERE'S THE KILLER.
what MAKES SOMEBODY LIKE OSCAR VIBENIUS DO IT?
look. THERE'S THE KILLER.
Oh, LORD.
don't MAKE ME CUT A BITCH.
Hey, I'M JUST HERE FOR PIE AND CONVERSATION,
neither OF WHICH ARE CAUSE TO CALL A MAN A BITCH.
you're TRYING TO KILL NAPOLEON LeNEZ.
if I AM, I'M NOT A VERY GOOD KILLER.
I KEEP BLOWING THINGS UP, BUT NEVER WHO I WANT TO BLOW UP?
I SAID THAT. HAVE YOU BEEN SPYING ON ME?
yod BE SURPRISED WHAT YOU CAN HEAR WHEN YOU PRESS YOUR EAR TO THE RIGHT PIPE.
if IT WASN'T YOU, THEN WHO WAS TRYING TO KILL LeNEZ?
I HAVE THEORIES.
you've BEEN CONDUCTING YOUR INVESTIGATION.
I've BEEN CONDUCTING MINE.
we SHOULD TALK, COMPARE NOTES, COME TO CONCLUSIONS.
now, HOW'S ABOUT YOU PUT THAT KNIFE TO USE
and CUT ME OFF A PIECE OF PERSIMMON PIE?
all RIGHT, LET'S COMPARE NOTES.
why WERE YOU IN THE SEWER WITH YOUR HANDS ON A BOOBY TRAP?
narrator: WHY OSCAR VIBENIUS HAD HIS HANDS ON A BOOBY TRAP WAS THIS.
after LEARNING OF THE ATTEMPT ON LeNEZ'S LIFE,
Mr. VIBENIUS TRAILED HIS FORMER COLLEAGUE TO A SEWER MAIN,
where HE LOST TRACK OF HIM.
but WHAT HE FOUND IN HIS STEAD
was A MYSTERIOUS YELLOW, THICK HOSE,
which HE QUICKLY REALIZED
was PART OF A PLOT TO BLOW UP NAPOLEON LeNEZ'S CAR.
he WORKED QUICKLY TO DISABLE THE THREAT,
but COULDN'T DISMANTLE THE BOMB BEFORE HE WAS STARTLED IN THE DARK.
narrator: FEARING SAID BOMB WAS ABOUT TO BLOW,
he CHOSE TO RUN FOR COVER RATHER THAN EXPLAIN HIS ACTIONS.
how DO WE KNOW YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH?
LeNEZ PRACTICALLY SAID THAT YOU WERE A CHUD A CANNIBALISTIC
I KNOW WHAT A CHUD IS, AND I KNOW NAPOLEON LeNEZ.
did HE TELL YOU WHAT YOU SMELLED LIKE WHEN YOU MET HIM?
he THINKS PEOPLE LIKE THAT.
he SAID I SMELLED LIKE HONEY.
like YOU'VE BEEN DIPPED IN IT.
there's SOMETHING ELSE YOU SMELL LIKE.
I KNOW. DEATH. IT'S MY PERFUME.
you're NOT WEARING PERFUME.
no, THIS ISN'T DEATH.
this IS SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER.
I've NEVER SMELLED ANYTHING LIKE IT.
do ME. DO ME. WHAT DO I SMELL LIKE?
dog.
never MIND DOG.
we NEED PROOF. WE'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE YOU JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY SO.
would YOU BELIEVE YOUR NOSES?
smells LIKE ROTTEN EGGS.
well, IT WAS INCINERATED IN AN EXPLODING BALL OF METHANE GAS.
what ELSE WOULD IT SMELL LIKE?
nothing.
methane GAS IS ODORLESS.
I COOK WITH GAS. IT SMELLS LIKE ROTTEN EGGS.
the UTILITY COMPANIES ADD A SYNTHETIC CHEMICAL SMELL TO IT
before IT'S PUMPED INTO OUR HOUSES.
but A METHANE EXPLOSION IN THE SEWER WOULDN'T HE A SMELL,
unless SOMEONE THOUGHT AN IGNORANT PUBLIC EXPECTED IT TO.
someone ELITIST,
someone LIKE LeNEZ.
and WITH A BOOK ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED,
he HAS THE MOST TO GAIN BY AN ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE.
nothing SELLS BOOKS LIKE A LITTLE MURDER AND YHEM.
I ALREADY PREORDERED MY PY.
narrator: AS NAPOLEON LeNEZ'S STAR APPEARED TO RISE,
Lily AND VIVIAN'S STAR CONTINUED TO FALL
as THEY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH A BOX OF SLIDES DOCUMENTING HAPPIER TIMES.
Oh, LOOK, LILY!
it's WHEN WE WENT TO THE HEBREW FETA SECT.
I MISS MY EYE.
peculiar.
what?
you SAID YOU MISS YOUR EYE BEFORE YOU SAID YOU MISS CHARLOTTE.
when I LOOKED AT THAT PICTURE,
the FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF WAS, "I MISS CHARLOTTE.
good GOD, VIVIAN.
it WAS THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF, TOO.
it JUST SO HAPPENS, I DON'T ALWAYS SAY EVERYTHING I THINK.
fancy THAT.
it WASN'T YOUR EYE -- WHY WE STOPPED SWIMMING.
we TOLD PEOPLE IT WAS, BUT IT WASN'T.
we've BEEN STOPPED SWIMMING LONG ENOUGH
for IT NOT TO MATTER WHY WE STOPPED SWIMMING.
it USED TO MAKE YOU SO HAPPY, THE WATER.
I THINK IT'S BRAVE TO TRY TO BE HAPPY.
you've GOTTEN SO COMFORTABLE BEING UNHAPPY.
wouldn't IT BE WONDERFUL
to WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY,
to LET THE WATER WASH EVERYTHING AWAY?
you FORGOT YOUR CHLORINE TABLETS.
narrator: HER OLFACTORY GLANDS STIMULATED WITH THE SMELLS OF SYNCHNIZED SWIMMING,
Lily EXPERIENCED A FLOOD OF ENDORPHINS
from THE SCENT OF BOTTLED SUNSHINE
as NAPOLEON LeNEZ EXPERIENCED A FLOOD OF ENDORPHINS FROM HIS MEDIA BLITZ,
which LEFT THE PIE MAKER
to CARRY OUT A BLIND-SIDE BLITZ OF HIS OWN.
where DID YOGO?
I WAS BORED AND SNOOPING.
okay, MAYBE IPSO FACTO SNOOPING,
but IT WASN'T MY GOAL TO SNOOP, JUST ENTERTAIN MYSELF.
you KNOW HOW WHEN YOU'RE A GUEST AND YOU'RE BORED
and YOU GO INTO THE BATHROOM AND READ THROUGH THE MAGAZINES
and RUMMAGE THROUGH THE MEDICINE CABINET,
look IN THE CLOSETS AND UNDER THE BED,
and YOU FIND SOMETHING YOU WERE NEVER MEANT TO SEE?
get TO THE POINT.
damn.
that COULDN'T HAVE GONE BETTER IF I'D PLANNED IT.
smell IT, CRAVE IT, OWN IT.
that's THE SPIRIT.
so, ONCE YOU SMELL IT, THEN YOU CRAVE IT.
how FAR ARE YOU WILLING TO GO BEFORE YOU OWN IT?
you CAN'T JUST SCRATCH AND SNIFF AND MAKE A WISH.
you GOT TO HAVE A PLAN, AND ACCORDING TO YOU,
this THING COULDN'T HAVE GONE BETTER
if YOU'D PLANNED IT YOURSELF, WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE
you PLANNED ITOURSELF.
you SET OSCAR UP
after YOU FIGURED OUT THE CORRECT SPACING.
this IS RIDIC
how DARE
I AM NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND BE ACCUSED.
I THINK IT'S BEST IF YOU BOTH LEAVE.
I CONCUR.
Napoleon: WHEN I SUGGESTED YOU LEAVE,
I DIDN'T MN THE PENTHOUSE.
I MEANT THIS MORTAL COIL.
congratulations, GENTLEMEN.
you're ABOUT TO FALL VICTIM TO ATTEMPT NUMBER THREE ON MY LIFE.
but DON'T WORRY.
I'll MENTION YOU IN THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OF THE SECOND PRINTING OF MY BOOK.
Oh, HELL, NO!
Hey!
you GOT EXACTLY 3 SECONDS TO OPEN THIS DAMN DOOR!
what's THAT -- THAT SMELL IS
the CHAMBER FILLING UP WITH AN AMALGAMATION OF EXPLOSIVE GASES,
which WILL ERUPT ON MY MARK.
so, PLEASE, IF YOU'RE IN A HURRY TO DIE,
fire YOUR GUN AND SET THE CHAMBER ABLAZE.
but KILLING US ISN'T GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING!
says YOU.
imagine THE PUBLIC OUTCRY WHEN THE PRESS RELEASES PHOTOS
of MY CHARRED DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER,
the CRISPY CORPSES OF TWO PRIVATE DETECTIVES
unfortunate ENOUGH TO TRIGR
my NEMESIS'S THIRD ATTEMPT ON MY LIFE.
how TRAGIC, BUT HOW PERFECTLY TITILLATING.
boy, ANITA SURE MADE A BIG MISTAKE
hitching HER HORSE TO YOUR WAGON.
don't SAY THAT. I NEVER MEANT TO HURT HER.
you KILLED HER!
but I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
her DEATH WAS AN ACCIDENT.
narrator: WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR HIS PUBLISHER WAS GOING TO BURY HIS LIFE'S WORK,
LeNEZ CONCOCTED AN EXPLOSIVE MARKETING STRATEGY OF HIS VERY OWN.
he WOULD BOOST INTEREST HIS BOOK.
by PRETENDING TOE THE TARGET OF A MURDEROUS RIVAL'S ATTACK.
his DISCOVERY OF THE BOOBY-TRAPPED TOME
would CREATE A PUBLICITY WHIRLWIND HIS PUBLISHER COULD NOT IGNORE.
but THERE WERE VARIABLES HE COULDN'T CONTROL,
including THE UTTER DEVOTION
of HIS MOST DEDICATED STUDENT, ANITA GRAY,
who COULDN'T RESIST A QUICK SNIFF.
narrator: STILL, ANITA'S DEATH ONLY FUELED THE FIRE,
increasing HIS BOOK'S PRESALES EXPONENTIALLY.
so, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, LeNEZ SET THE REST OF HIS PLOT IN MOTION.
he PINNED THE CRIME ON OSCAR, AS PLANNED,
and FURTHER CAPITALIZED ON THE GROWING PUBLICITY
by STAGING A SECOND, MORE SPECTACULAR ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE,
an ATTEMPT THAT OSCAR HIMSELF MISTAKENLY HELPED LEGITIMIZE
by APPEARING ON THE SCENE TO STOP IT.
good GEN
please GIVE ANITA MY FELICITATIONS.
and, AGAIN, TELLER I'M SORRY.
Hi, EMERSON.
Hey, OLIVE.
Ned: WAIT, NO, NO!
it's OKAY! OSCAR REVERSED THE PUMPS!
he WHAT?
narrator: USING HIS EX KNO OF THE CITY'S UNDERGROUND ELECTRICAL GRID,
Oscar HAD REPROGRAMMED LeNEZ'S ENTIRE DECONTAMINATION SYSTEM
just PRIOR TO ENTERING THE BUILDING.
repurposed AND REJIGGERED,
it NO LONGER PROTECTED HIM FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
instead, IT DID JUST THE OPPOSITE.
no. NO, NO, NO, NO.
no.
no!!
no!!
narrator: AS THE SYSTEM PURGED ITSELF,
the MAN WHO DEMANDED PURITY WAS BRANDED A FILTHY MURDERER.
and THE MAN WHO EMBRACED FILTH
rejoiced THAT HIS SOLID REPUTATION H BEEN EANSED.
I'm CANCELING MY PREORDER.
narrator: SATISFIED THAT ANOTHER CASE HAD BEEN CLOSED,
our HEROES RETURNED HOME.
elsewhere, A TENTATIVE BREEZE OF HOPE SIGNALED A NEW BEGINNING.
what ARE YOU DOING?
narrator: ANOTHER CASE CLOSED,
emerson TEMPORARILY SET ASIDE HIS KNITTING NEEDLES
to PURSUE A NEW HOBBY...
...one THAT MAGNIFIED HIS HAPPINESS TENFOLD.
I LOVE POP-UP BOOKS.
Hey. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY OLD SWEATER, HAVE YOU?
no. HAVE YOU SEEN MY NEW MENUS?
no.
for ME?
for YOU.
CUP-PIES.
narrator: THE MERE SIGHT OF EACH OTHER
left THE PIE MAKER AND THE GIRL NAMED CHUCK
feeling EXACTLY LIKE THEY WANTED TO FEEL
safe AND WARM AND LOVED.
meanwhile, OSCAR VIBENIUS EMBRACED AN OBSESSION OF HIS OWN.
Chuck AND HER SECRET WERE IN DANG.
and THIS TIME, IT WASN'T SO MUCH ABOUT THE TELLING
as IT WAS THE SMELLING.
what if you didn't have to be dead?
nobody can know.
you touch murder victims, you ask who killed them.
you touch them again, they go back to being dead, and you collect the reward?
that's it in a nutshell.
who's the funny girl stuck to ned?
childhood sweetheart.
do they touch much?
wish they would.
what's she doing here?
that girl's got to go.
that girl's not going anywhere.
we haven't seen each other in 20 years.
don't you want to know about me?
I want to know everything about you.
we all have secrets.
at this very moment, young ned was 9 years, 34 weeks, 12 hours, and 54 minutes old.
he was a gifted boy
not academically, nor athletically.
he was gifted in a way no other boy was gifted.
young ned could touch dead things and bring them back to life.
but if he touched the dead thing twice, it died again forever.
the consequence of not touching a dead thing twice was as cruel as any consequence, and that was something else had to die.
young ned rationalized this consequence was beyond his control.
he was not to blame.
but to remain blameless, he had to understand.
he realized to give life, he had to take it.
deat however, had a grace period.
what young ned did not know was how long that grace period was.
one minute.
fearing the consequences of his actions, ned vowed to never, ever again bring the dead back to life for more than a minute until he did it again.
the expression "pie in the sky" entered popular culture in 1911.
it refers to a dessert so sweet, it can only be found in heaven.
if you're craving something before you die,
I recommend where the pie maker makes his pies.
but if you're like chuck, you may enjoy the pie en after you die.
her 60 seconds came and went.
she stayed alive, and instead, someone else had to die.
he kept chuck blissfully unaware of this fact.
she was alive again.
that was that.
which birthday do I celebrate?
I've got two of them now
the first day I was alive, the first day I was alive again.
the one that requires less explanation.
you remember my 8th birthday, right before my dad died?
you remember what you got me?
a t-shirt.
with a beaver on it.
he had little lipstick kisses on his cheek, and he was holding a sign saying, "be kind to animals."
kiss a beaver.
I suppose should be celebrating every minute now, shouldn't I?
I could be anybody now, anybody I want.
I like that idea.
I'm gonna give that some thought.
the pie maker liked that idea, as well, as long as her thoughts didn't fall on...
why is it only a minute?
a minute seems awfully arbitrary.
Oh, a minute's a long time.
a lot can happen in a minute.
besides, t-the longer someone's around that's not supposed to be around, the more likely it is that something will happen
not necessarily directly or by any fault of theirs, but, you know, butterfly wings and such.
what about 'em?
they cause hurricanes.
Oh, right. Am I a hurricane?
a little bit, but I, uh -- I like the weather.
you really shouldn't do that.
Chuck wasn't the only storm brewing in the pie hole that evening.
an innocuous low-pressure system was forming that would soon become hurricane olive.
watching the pie maker kiss the woman that wasn't her, olive stopped breathing.
it was as if all the oxygen had left the room.
espresso, please.
we have coffee.
you have an espresso machine.
it's broken -- sits there being pretty, but nobody touches it.
decaf or regular?
no flavors -- hazelnut, french vanilla?
why can't sugar be enough?
here's your sugar.
Oh, I forgot to breathe.
ever feel like all the oxygen left the room?
Oh, my, yes.
in that moment, alfredo aldarisio recognized a kindred spirit in olive snook.
he also lived in constant fear of the oxygen leaving the room, but his pathology ran much, much deeper.
he was haunted by the notion that, at any moment, the earth could lose its atmosphere, and he would be sucked into the vacuum of space.
excuse me.
a traveling salesman by trade, Mr. Aldarisio sells pharmaceutical alternatives, which he also uses to manage his condition.
medicinal.
you're not wrong about the oxygen leaving the room.
the planet is losing atmosphere.
it's affecting gravity.
volumes aren't what they used to be.
they had to adjust the kilogram.
well, if you ask me, the kilogram needs to be taken down a peg.
decaf or regular?
regular, lots of sugar, more than enough.
emerson cod, private investigator, made a business of murder, but before he could get down to business...
I feel like ice cream.
musing on the idea of setting someone on fire doesn't mean you really want to set them on fire.
it's just the thought of it that makes you happy, but only for a second.
then you feel bad, but that second can be a lot fun.
you thinking of setting someone on fire?
no, I was just speaking in the figurative.
but figuratively speaking, someone should set you on fire for throwing my heart under the bus when you told me he didn't want me.
that was the truth bus.
that wasn't the truth bus.
that was the bitchy crosstown express.
by "bitchy," you mean "frank and honest"?
if I want frank and honest
well, I don't want frank and honest.
I never want frank and honest, so let's just take it off the docket.
while we're on the subject of frank and honest,
I don't like that girl, not one bit.
emerson cod liked her even less, so much so, it warranted a private conversation with the pie maker, but not private enough.
so, somebody died?
how did they die?
they died mysteriously.
he somebody or she somebody?
he. I told you i wanted to discuss this in private.
Chuck is private -- part of my private.
she ain't part of mine. I don't know her.
so, what's the mysterious part, the way they died or the circumstances?
I mean, did you find him with a noose around his neck and you didn't quite know how it got there, or did he drown in his bed, but the sheets were all dry?
you're obsessed.
am I? Do you think dying has made me morbid?
come on. How did the somebody die?
said it felt like life just got up and left him, like I'm gonna get up and leave you.
do you know what it could be?
it could be one of those untraceable poisons, or a four-stage poison, when you have to, like, touch four things before it actually kills the person.
it could be that.
what did you say it was besides mysterious?
I have not yet expressed my opinion.
would you care to express it now?
my opinion is, you need to take a coupon for this conversation and redeem it at another date.
I want to use my coupon now.
redeem it tomorrow.
there's somebody in the county fridge I need you to talk to in prite -- my private
which doesn't include her, so she better not come.
I can write a book on hand moisturizer.
nobody wants the last thing they've been touched with to be ashy and dry.
take a gander.
smooth.
you got some serious cracks going on there.
put those up here.
Hi.
thought you just came by to say "hello."
you won't even know I'm here.
cause you leaving? - No.
come on.
it makes her happy.
you remember what that happiness looks like.
redeem your coupon.
Oh, now you're gonna listen to me.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
I ain't gonna say another word.
"future me," though, is going, "I told you so, up one side of you and down the other one," but "now me" is just gonna sit back and watch.
Oh, no.
Oh, no,"what"?
the facts were these cunning and corrupt lawrence schatz was a funeral director who made a living off the dead above and beyond his job description.
2 days, 8 hours, and 43 minutes before his death, he was exposed as a grave robber.
I-I was just prepping the body for burial.
your wife's gorgeous.
how did you guys meet?
but before any legal action could be taken and before the spoils of his grave-robbing could be found, lawrence schatz found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.
he was 44 years, 17 months, 10 days, 6 hours, and 9 minutes old when he was in approximate proximity of the pie maker,
but to keep his sleeping beauty alive meant that someone else had to die.
what if you didn't have to be dead?
and one minute later, the pie maker took a life...
and gave it to someone else.
why are you running away?
vertigo -- dizzy. The room started spinning, and I, uh -- I think it's my shoes.
they're, uh, stiff, and they pinch, and I, uh -- I think they're cutting off my circulation.
that was mean. That was a very mean thing you did.
Really? 'Cause "future me" is re now, and he's got something to say.
but you didn't touch him.
how are we supposed to find out who killed him if you didn't touch him?
already know who killed him.
so the mysterious part is how he was killed.
already know that, too.
okay, how was he killed, and who was the killer?
Yeah. Who was the killer?
the pie maker's eye twitched in anticipation of the lie he was about to tell, but, instead, what he told was the truth.
me.
what?
you killed someone?
who did you kill? - I didn't.
you didn't -- that's why somebody died.
please stop talking.
you didn't what?
look here, you need a ticket to ride this ride.
if your ticket gets punched, then you got to take somebody else's ticket.
why are you still talking?
I'm ripping off the band-aid.
I'm not a ripper -- I pull up a corner a little at a time, then I run it under warm water, and I pull it up a little more.
it's a process.
let it rip.
I didn't actively kill.
I'm not an active killer.
I'm not a killer.
you killed someone for me?
it wasn't my fault.
it's a random proximity thing.
there was no choice or decision-making whatsoever.
it just happened.
but you knew it would happen.
I was incapacitated with not being able to think.
I had one thought in my head, and it was of you, and it clogged me up so no other thoughts could get through, including the one telling me to touch you again.
so every minute I've been celebrating wasn't really mine to celebrate.
as chuck considered the life she was living that was not her own...
olive considered the life she was not living.
might I make an observation?
compliment or criticism?
a neutral thought, I would say.
it's neither complimentary nor critical.
neutral thought gives me pause.
neutral for only this portion of the conversation, but I do have complimentary observations as part of a follow-up discussion, which I intend to headline with an offer to repair your espresso machine.
what's your neutral thought?
you deem decidedly unhappy.
I haven't decided that.
no anxieties, neuroses, pathologies?
garden variety. What are you beating at?
I'm beating at happiness.
I've beaten it into submission and bottled it for convenience.
it's homeopathic.
meaning it deeply relate to gay people.
"gay" only in that they are bright and happy.
you never have to worry about the oxygen leaving the room again.
don't go bothering the customers with this.
this is a pie house, not some herbal crack den.
Chuck, say something.
I can't, for the life of me, think of anything to say.
Oh, I forgot -- it's not even my life, is it?
not now.
I feel violated.
that was my information.
there's your information, and then there's my information.
that was our information.
you let a man die on our time, a man who could have been me.
it wasn't.
but it could have been.
that was a business associate of mine.
who do you think hooked us up with corpse bride?
but he stole stuff off dead people.
regardless of how he ran his own business, he never interfered with how I ran mine.
you, on the other hand, made me an accomplice to a murder.
stop saying that. I didn't murder anyone.
there was no malice or forethought.
okay, maybe accidental, involuntary manslaughter.
Oh, you accidentally, involuntarily let dead girl live?
well...
Mm-hmm, yeah, that's what I thought you was gonna say.
lawrence schatz was murdered enough for his brother to hire me to find out who killed him.
why did you take this case?
you want me to take this case.
I'm making sure nobody else solves it.
look, I didn't want to go down this road with you.
I'm sensitive to your experience.
I understand that it's traumatic.
but now I need to chat with lawrence schatz before he goes into the ground tomorrow.
I'm not going back to that funeral home.
it's returning to the scene of a crime -- that's just sloppy.
and by the way, to ask him what?
I want to ask lawrence what he did with all those precious family heirlooms.
so you can return it to the families and help heal the grieng?
Yeah, 'cause after the grieving stops, you have joy, and with joy comes money, and louis schatz will stop asking questions about how his brother died.
I'm not touching lawrence schatz. It's too traumatic.
I am fragile on this issue.
that how it is? - Yeah.
that's how it is.
whatever you say, killer.
the pie maker rationalized circumstances beyond his control were responsible for lawrence schatz's death.
he was not to blame.
rationalizing those rationalizations to the man he inadvertently killed was something he'd rather not do.
I want to talk to louis schatz.
I want you to talk to him, too.
why would I do that?
so you can apologize, and I can say "thank you."
as the pie maker found himself back at the scene of his crime, chuck found herself back where her second life began, now with the understanding of how it began.
have you already been here?
hmm?
lawrence is dead.
Hey, emerson. - Hey, louie.
darling mermaid darlings.
Yeah, we just buried their niece, lonely tourist charlotte charles.
you see they're on tour. - I do. It's so exciting.
tour was canceled.
they're in a dark place, some kind of an emotional relapse.
have we met before?
no. - No.
the cause of the darling mermaid darlings' emotional relapse was this...
after losing chuck, aunts lily and vivian had a better appreciation of the preciousness of life.
with luggage packed, bonnets cinched, and sunscreen vigorously applied, they were ready at last to start their long-awaited comeback tour, but not today.
to their surprise, there was something waiting in the morning mail, alongside the thrifty nickel and the pennysaver.
it's from charlotte.
in that moment, only for a moment, aunt lily forgot chuck was dead...
or, at least, dead to her.
then she remembered.
poor, poor charlotte.
and with that, the darling mermaid darlings canceled their comeback tour.
I'm having a martini and going to bed.
you know, uh, larry died on the same day we buried lonely tourist charlotte charles.
we don't often bury a celebrity.
celebrity.
burying a celebrity, even a pseudo-celebrity, who's only famous for how she died, must be a coup for any funeral home, I'd imagine it would be, if it wasn't for larry's grave-robbing scandal or his murder.
he's in here.
I got it locked, so no one can defile his dead body.
are you sure he was murdered?
I've been putting it all together.
and, boy, do I have a tale to tell.
and this is the tale louis schatz told.
he detailed a series of events that began when he caught his brother lawrence in the act.
I was just prepping the body for burial.
your wife's gorgeous.
how'd you meet?
Aw, larry. How could you?
when word of lawrence's grave-robbing ways spread through the sleepy hollow of coeur d'coeurs, there was public outrage.
bulk hate mail and death threat by the hundreds frightened the truth out of lawrence.
according to louis, he only confessed his sins to the one person he knew would forgive him.
I buried it all where no one could find it.
you have to give everything back.
but I buried it really deep.
Louis insisted what his brother lawrence did not confess was where he had hidden the spoils of his grave-robbery.
that secret he took to his own grave when he presumably died of heart failure.
but as louis was besieged by angry families seeking the return of stolen heirlooms, he began to wonder -- what if it wasn't heart failure?
what if his brother was murdered?
what if, in the hundreds of letters addressed to lawrence schatz, threatening his life, one of them was a promise?
what if his brother was murdered, and what if his murder was next?
I told larry it was bad karma.
the whole thing makes me sick -- just sick.
do you know what it's like to live in daily fear that one minute you could drop dead right where you're standing because of something somebody else did?
I feel like I could smoke a cigar with you.
I don't smoke. That was larry.
here. Take it.
he would.
it's true what they say about twins
his life was my life.
it's strange to share someone's life.
I feel like mine's tainted now.
I would love to give back what he took.
can we have a moment to pay our respects, while you go rustle up that hate mail to go?
Yeah.
as they stood over the man who died for one of them and was killed by the other, chuck and the pie maker carefully planned their words.
yes?
I'm sorry for what I did.
it was mostly an accident, but partially on purpose.
however inadvertent, I am sorry I did it.
that's all.
hello.
lonely tourist charlotte charles, are you part of my welcoming committee?
more like a beneficiary, in that I'm still alive, which is why you're not.
am I a human sacrifice?
Hey, emerson.
Oh, hey, larry.
What'd you do with all that stuff you stole off them dead people?
why don't you ask louis what he did with it?
Louis said you buried it.
and you believed him. You met louis?
Hey, how did I die? Did somebody kill me?
Hey, did louis kill me?
nobody killed you, per se.
y-yes, they did. It was so that I could live.
it wasn't personal. I didn't pick you.
the selection is purely random, but it didn't help that you were in the next room.
Louis has all that stuff you stole?
we stole -- it was a family business.
Louis has everything but this watch.
my dad gave me a watch just like that.
you were buried with it. Well, you were supposed to be.
caught me in the cookie jar.
you stole that off my dead body?
your dead body wasn't doing anything with it.
Hey, what are you doing? Hey! Hey!
it's stuck.
you better be playing.
29 seconds.
Oh, hell, no!
one minute's time was nearing its end.
random selection was about to begin.
5 seconds!
maybe I should let him have his life back.
not how it works.
no regifting!
that wasn't cool, you guys.
look.
Aw, that was so sweet of my aunts to bury it with me.
my dad had it, and then I had it.
then I suppose he had it, which really steams me.
you got it back?
Yeah, I did.
it's nice to get things back.
my aunts canceled their tour.
I was really looking forward to hiding out in the crowd with a big pair of sunglasses and a parasol, watching them perform in their mermaid suits.
he said they were in a dark place.
he said they had some kind of emotional relapse.
couldn't we just...
you can't see your aunts.
I'm sorry.
if chuck could not regift the life she'd been given, she at least wanted to find a way to share it with her aunts lily and vivian.
anybody dead back there that shouldn't be?
no.
sweet.
after lawrence schatz was exposed as a grave robber, the mailbox at the schatz brothers funeral home received 1, 867 hate letters, each one a catalog of heirlooms feared stolen or lost.
Louis schatz is a big, fat liar.
and I say "fat" in reference to his size as a liar, not as a judgment of his physical appearance.
I'm not mad at him for lying.
if I could pin my crimes on some dead relative, especially some guilty dead relative, I'd certainly consider it.
that sucker played me like boo-boo the fool hiring me to make him look innocent.
he knew all along where that dead-people treasure was buried.
it's all right, though.
I'm gonna follow his lying fat ass until he lead me right to it.
then I'm gonna take it.
you can't steal dead people's stuff.
I'm not the one who stole it.
I don't condone what they did, but it's once removed now.
I'm not the pirate -- I'm just looking for treasure.
the pirate metaphor is weak.
it's apt.
I find a dead pirate treasure at the bottom of the sea,
I take it -- doesn't matter whose it was, if whose was is dead, 'cause it's mine now.
this -- this isn't a doubloon.
this is somebody's something.
stealing from a pirate who already stole is still stealing.
it's not once removed.
somebody didn't want that something if they buried it with somebody who can't use it.
what if lawrence schatz was murdered for this buried treasure?
well, was gonna be before you got to him.
why'd you have to say it like that?
there's a lot of hostility in these letters.
do you realize how angry someone has to be to put pen to paper?
I mean, these people are furious.
any one of them could be the killer.
lawrence schatz wasn't murdered.
he was accidentally, involuntarily man slaughtered.
I appreciate that.
there ain't no killer.
be that as it may, murder was on someone's mind.
as chuck catalogued another missing heirloom, she considered what her aunts had lost and how it could never be returned.
this is depressing.
did you say "depressing"?
fda-approved pharmaceutical-grade herbology.
like a bully for your emotions.
emotions need to be bullied, or at least groomed.
indulging depression is like indulging a horrible, willful child.
if you allow it to run roughshod, you'll find yourself catering to its every whim.
so, bully it, and bully it good.
everyone needs to be bullied sometimes.
do you have any literature?
I have a pamphlet, if you'd like to read that.
our herbs for depression contain proven ingredients in the proper doses, manufactured with the strictest of quality control.
"Herbs for depression" sounds so much more civil than "antidepressants."
and with fewer side effects.
can I have these?
I can't just give it to you.
it's a controlled substae.
but I have a sample pack.
Chuck wasn't thinking of herself.
she was thinking of her aunts.
even after she was dead and gone, chuck found a way to do what she had done all her life care for her aunts.
Oh, you forgot one.
outside my zone.
Oh, it's not so far.
do you want to be a delivery boy or a delivery man?
boy. You be a man.
but it's my day off.
and I'm a girl!
in her own way, olive identified with the plight of the abandoned pie.
it was meant for someone, and without a little effort, it would never be with the one it was meant to be with.
and tragically for louis schatz, he was meant to be with his brother.
Hey, I didn't hear you leave this morning.
I didn't hear you come in last night.
I was having conversations with myself.
what did you guys talk about?
I asked myself, "if I were storming a castle to save a sleeping beauty from the jaws of death," and in the melee, my sword of truth flew swift and sure
and killed an unfortunate outlaw huddled nearby, how would I feel?
did you successfully rescue sleeping beauty?
in this scenario, yeah.
and how would you feel, hypothetically?
I'd feel happy and then bad, and primarily happy, and then I'd think about it too much, and then I'd feel bad again.
that's kind of how I feel exactly how I feel.
well, I don't want you to think I'm a killer.
I don't want to think you're a killer, either. I want to think of you as prince charming.
I'm not setting a standard for you to live up to. It's just did you -- did you
no.
No!
as chuck and the pie maker considered the dead schatz brother in the freezer, olive snook considered the consequences of drivi several towns away to make a delivery to an address that was not part of the regular delivery route.
as she drew closer to the front door, olive considered the sheer number of crimes against delivery people and how they were on the rise.
s. O.S!O. S!O. S!S. O.S!
this pie smells delicious.
pies for breakfast always remind me of mother.
vermouth always reminds me of mother.
why are we having pie, and who the hell are you?
forgive lily.
the last time we had visitors, there was a home invasion.
that was all over the evening news.
you're darling mermaid darlings vivian and lily charles.
I saw you perform at the callum county country fair when I was a little girl.
olive is in the pie industry.
Really?
someone has made you the happy recipients of a pie from the pie hole, as in "shut your."
or, in this case, "open your," 'cause it's real good.
the pie hole -- I like it.
it's provocative.
well, you must love pie to make it your life's work.
lots to love at the pie hole.
there's gruye baked into the crust.
Oh, I didn't even know we did that.
Charlotte loved gruye.
we recently lost our niece, lonely tourist charlotte charles.
it's all over the news.
I am so sorry for your loss.
make sure you're sick of hearing it.
I don't want to beat a sentiment to do
I'm so sorry for your loss.
this has to be from that young man who lived next door when charlotte was a girl.
Oh, he had a filthy mind as a child.
he gave charlotte a beaver t-shirt for her 8th birthday.
what did we call him?
beaver boy.
beaver boy.
seems like he grew up to be a nice young man.
beaver boy did say he was a pie maker.
I imagine he gives lots of people pie.
beaver boy's a pie maker?
who was childhood sweethearts with your niece, lonely touri charlotte charles, who is dead?
presently?
the truth about the dead girl who wasn't dead vibrated on olive's tongue.
she dare not let it out, so she took another bite.
not realizing louis schatz was dead and wedged between chilling dough and yesterday's eggs, emerson cod prepared to monitor every move he made, in hopes of finding buried treasure.
Yeah.
Hi, um, one of the schatz brothers
it's louis.
Louis schatz is in my freezer, and I'm not sure how he got there, because it doesn't look like it was his own doing, on account of he's dead and all.
you being set up.
he said we're being set up.
why would anyone want to set us up?
no, you being set up.
why would anyone want to set me up?
hell if I know.
maybe they figure, since you killed the other one...
have I been exposed? Does somebody know?
somebody knows something, and that somebody probably already called the police.
Hey, the police are here.
Hi. You need to follow us.
where are we going?
you're going to heaven.
I got in?
Yeah, and heaven's closing in like five minutes.
or one, actually.
heaven's closing in like one minute.
Hey, emerson, you going to heaven, too?
Yeah, we all going to heaven.
that's so weird. We died at the same time.
the rapture. - No way.
yes way.
is larry here?
Yeah, he told us to ask you what you did with all that stuff you stole off those dead folks.
Yeah, but first, you got to tell us who killed you.
heaven would want to know.
I choked on a piece of tongue.
yours or somebody else's?
in this instance, the tongue belonged to a cow.
although louis schatz had been limiting his portions, they weren't so small they couldn't block his windpipe when he was confronted by an angry customer.
he said something about a civil war heirloom. Then I lost consciousness.
I usually cough it up before I pass out.
5 seconds.
there's no seat belts in this car.
wait, wait, wait, wait!
what did you do with all that stuff you stole off those dead folk?
sorry.
what are we gonna do with the body?
we're gonna put schatz back exactly where he died and show whoever this sucker was who tried to frame you how a sucker gets framed.
we don't know who this sucker is.
Yes, we do -- wilfred woodruff.
in chuck's cataloging of heirlooms feared stolen by trusted funeral professionals, she came across a particularly angry death threat written by one wilfred woodruff.
Mr. Woodruff claimed a civil war heirloom, supposedly buried with his grandfather, was offered in an online auction, which was traced back to the brothers schatz.
Mr. Woodruff clearly stated in writing that punishment for insulting the woodruff family honor in such a way was death.
just forward to killing you
it's all locked up.
what?
I ain't gonna fit.
you'll fit.
there's plenty of room.
Oh, the window looked bigger from up there.
are you stuck?
no.
Yes, you are. You're like winnie-the-pooh.
give me your paws, pooh.
you people stop pulling me!
Oh, this isn't good at it.
what part of "do not resuscitate" don't you people understand?
honey, did you turn off the gas?
the pie maker considered the choices he had made that brought him to this very moment, a moment that may be his last.
the irony of being struck down by the man who murdered the twin of the man he killed was not lost on the pie maker.
also not lost -- his agility.
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
what's going on in there?!
Wilfred woodruff found his sword!
I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.
what line? It's autumn.
ulysses S. Grant said that not all of it, just the last part.
bad-luck missionary ridge
my great-great-great-great- grandpappy fought proudly against him with this sword.
are you adopted?
Wilfred woodruff was not adopted.
on a hot day in the summer of 1863, wilfred woodruff's great-great-great-great- grandfather, phan bing wu, was laying track for the central pacific railroad.
the decision was made to find a better life.
as the civil war was still raging, the other men chose to go northwest.
why phan bing wu chose to run southeast is not known.
some said it was the hand of destiny.
others felt it was heatstroke.
eventually, phan bing was forced to steal the clothes off a former soldier.
returning to his journey, he soon realized he was not alone.
phan bing immediately realized he did not belong in this place at this time.
but this time and place seemed more than happy to have him.
decorated for his bravery in the battle of missionary ridge and the second battle of murfrsboro, phan bing went on to found his own branch of the woodruff family tree.
this sword was supposed to be buried with my grandpa.
instead, it shows up in some online auction, at which I take umbrage!
remember, mind over matter makes pooh unfatter.
I might be stuck, but I can still reach my gun.
now, you should know that I was thrice named alternate swordmaster at the southern area regional volunteer infantry re-enactment regiment.
I wanted to be a jedi.
you killed louis schatz and stuffed him in my freezer.
I put food in there!
it wasn't my fault, it just happened.
not like you killed lawrence schatz.
did not!
I saw you.
you didn't see squat.
Wilfred woodruff saw more than squat when he approached lawrence schatz about his great-great-great-great- grandfather's sword.
he saw the pie maker fleeing the scene of lawrence schatz's murder.
I didn't touch lawrence schatz, not till after he died, and in his coffin.
I didn't touch louis schatz, not until after he died and i rolled him onto a dolly truck.
all because you wrote a nasty letter?
I wrote a death threat.
then someone died.
that has a way of coming back to haunt you.
unless you frame someone for murder, you ass!
I had no choice.
of course you did.
everything we do is a choice.
oatmeal or cereal, highway or side streets, kiss her or keep her?
we make choices, and we live with the consequences.
if someone gets hurt along the way, we ask for forgiveness.
it's the best anyone can do.
I can do better!
help!
kick, pooh, kick!
at that very moment, chuck saw the pie maker perhaps not as he really was, but as he would always appear to her prince charming.
olive snook's blood stirred with revelation and opportunity.
she could see chuck had ked her death for some nefarious purpose.
I can smell trouble on her, like she stepped in it and it's stuck to her heel.
what she couldn't see was the distant glimmer of her own prince charming.
the broken espresso machine, sitting there, being pretty, with no one to touch it, had been touched, filled with water, and packed with coffee grounds.
for the time being, the romantic gesture was lost on olive.
her espresso was much too bitter, but this would not be her last cup.
not bitter at all was emerson cod.
he learned a lesson from the brothers schatz. It wasn't what he had gained.
it was what he wanted to lose.
he didn't want to lead the life they led
not to say he no longer wanted to make a living off the dead.
he made a decision while wedged in the window that day never to be wedged again.
at that same moment, lily and vivian charles were enjoying a wedge of happiness with gruye baked into the crust.
woodruff was charged today for his involvement in the death of louis schatz key players in the grave-robbing scandal.
the gift of life chuck had been given was, indeed, the gift that kept giving.
she went about matching hateail with heirlooms and regifting them to their rightful heirs, like she had been regifted to the pie maker.
I would do it again.
Oh, I think it's nice the way it is.
no.
I made a choice, and I would do it again.
I let lawrence schatz die, and if I was faced with that choice right now,
I would make the same choice.
you could put me in a loop, and I would make the same choice every time.
that's how confident I am that it was the right choice for me to make.
I'm sorry if that makes me a bad person, but...
I'm not sorry that you're alive.
I like that you made that choice, and the fact that you did it on purpose
well, it makes it far more fun than if you did it by accident.
I'm gonna see if I've got some plastic wrap.
young ned had a special gift.
he could touch dead things and bring them back to life.
but he could only bring the dead back to life for one minute.
any longer, and someone else had to die.
and there was one more thing he had to learn first touch, life.
second touch, dead again forever.
but as young ned grew into the pie maker, this gift proved to be most useful in the untimely death of his childhood sweetheart.
are you in love with her?
you only got a minute. - I know.
60 seconds. - I know.
what if you didn't have to be dead?
you can't touch me.
so a kiss is out of the question?
you touch murder victims, you ask who killed them.
you touch them again, they go back to being dead, and then you collect the reward?
that's it in a nutshell.
today is my dad's birthday.
do you know he would have been 60 today if he were still alive?
it's my fault chuck's father's dead.
I should just tell her.
don't tell her.
I can't keep lying to her.
Chuck. - Mm-hmm?
I killed your dad.
it was like any day in play-doh village, except today death came.
young ned enjoyed bringing play-doh death to play-doh people.
he did not yet realize he could bring real death to real people.
young chuck was 8 years, 42 weeks, 3 hours, and 2 minutes old and about to become an orphan.
her father washed off the grit from a hard day conquering villages.
he wasn't just a star in her life.
he was a pocket universe full of stars.
Ned and his mother waited with chuck for her aunts lily and vivian to arrive.
Chuck would later remember ned being very quiet, staring at his mother as if staring at a ghost.
only ned knew his mother had already been dead once that day.
there but for the grace of god.
only ned knew that he had touched her back to life and, one minute later, chuck's father died.
it had seemed to ned a strange coincidence, a strange, troubling coincidence.
Chuck would remember ned didn't look at her.
she would remember vivian, who didn't like to touch anyone, was the first to embrace her, and she would remember lily, who had no problem with touch at all, couldn't bring herself within reach, not right away.
later that night, chuck would remember ned ringing the doorbell just after bedtime and lily telling her something happened.
another something happened?
his mother died.
it wasn't until lily hugged young ned after learning of his mother's passing that she took chuck in her arms.
it was no less difficult for chuck to let go of ned when his father whisked him away to be abandoned at the longborough school for boys.
Chuck would never see him again, not for as long as she lived.
it's 20 years, 2 months, 3 weeks, 2 days, 5 hours, and 54 minutes later, but this winter...
there's an unpleasant chill in the air.
after learning her father died because the pie maker brought his mother back to life, chuck disappeared into the night.
stop squawking, you twit!
the pie maker considered the places to find chuck...
the places she'd run, the places she called home.
who is it?
it's, uh, ned, the, uh, pie maker.
all this fuss about global warming.
can't happen soon enough, if you ask me.
why is it so cold in here?
Charlotte used to light the furnace.
the thought of outliving her seemed so unlikely, we never bothered to learn how to do it.
so it hasn't mysteriously lit itself, because, clearly, it's very cold.
clearly.
wouldn't it be lovely if charlotte's ghost returned to light the furnace?
would you like me to light the furnace?
on the subject of charlotte's ghost, if you sense her presence in any way when you say "presence..."
if you think you see her out of the corner of your eye or hear strange noises in your room or find suspicious footprints in the snow...
should we be expecting this presence?
because you're being kind of urgent over there.
Oh, god, no.
I'm just, uh, thawing, but if you were to see her or think you see her...
I saw charlotte once after she died.
then I blinked, and she was gone.
it was...
unpleasant, that trick my mind played on me.
and it's unpleasant of you to come here picking scabs in the middle of the night.
I didn't mean to pick.
thank you very much for lighting our furnace so charlotte's ghost wouldn't have to.
am I leaving? - Yes.
Hiya.
did you come by to get digby?
no. Have you seen chuck?
not since the chorus of slamming doors last night that woke me from a dead sleep.
Oh, did we get loud?
Oh, you were very loud.
after all the commotion, I peeped my peeper out the peephole, saw her getting on the elevator and you taking the stairs.
I take it you didn't catch her?
the elevator's fast, and those stairs were slippery.
I also heard you walking the streets, moaning her name like something out of a tennessee williams.
it may be romantic, but it's not dignified.
I don't know where she is, olive.
maybe she doesn't want you to know.
now go clean yourself up. You look like crap.
it was hard for olive snook to close the door on the pie maker's breaking heart.
are you gonna tell me what he did?
did he beat you? - No.
did he look like he wanted to beat you? - Olive.
is it over, you and him?
no, I don't know. I'm just digesting.
well, I guess you can stay here till you've passed whatever it is you're digesting.
thank you, and please don't tell him where I am.
Hey, digby.
did you shave his bum?
no, he must have got it caught in the vacuum.
did the vacuum take a bite out of you?
look, I know this is none of my business, but I have so many questions tugging at my tongue as to why you faked your death, and I've just felt like I needed to respect your privacy on this issue.
I appreciate that.
but I am not gonna respect your privacy right now.
why did you fake your death?
is this an insurance scam?
are you and the pie maker in some kind of cahoots together?
I died.
and he brought me back to life.
cahoots enough for you?
if you don't want to tell me, just say so.
I was just curious if you were fighting over the cahoots or something more personal.
more personal than cahoots-related.
can we go back to the "respecting my privacy" thing?
Yeah, sure.
I'm going to your aunts' later.
now that you're avoiding ned, I guess you won't be making them a pie.
you want me to grab one off the rack?
would you mind terribly making it from scratch?
they like it a certain way.
well, whatever way you've been making them is doing the trick.
the mermaids are swimming.
they're back in the water?
Vivian told me.
Lily doesn't want me to know. Thinks I'll glt. So I'm pretending not to.
I'm pretending not to know a lot these days.
pear with gruye baked into the crust?
Mm-hmm, and I add extra vanilla. It's my secret ingredient.
Lily loves vanilla.
you got it.
but chuck's secret ingredient wasn't vanilla.
it was an herbal mood enhancer.
olive snook had been delivering enhanced pies for weeks, not realizing she was a homeopathic-drug mule.
not very strong vanilla.
I told her I killed her father.
she asked you if you killed her dad?
did she ask you that? Did them words come out of her mouth?
no. We were talking about phantom limbs, and I blurted it out. It was like word vomit.
then you slipped in that word vomit andell on your ass, and now you're covered in word vomit.
dead girl could be out there all grudgy grudge with a beef to pick.
Hello, evening news.
I'm lonely tourist charlotte charles.
I just crawled out of my grave, and here's how.
stop it. I'm having difficulty breathing.
what kind of state is she in?
a bad state.
she just up and left, and now she's all alone in the cold, cold world.
sound like she wants to be out alone in the cold, cold world, so don't go tracking her down, reminding her why she's mad at you.
then she really will go to the evening news.
that's what I said, except for the evening-news part, which I don't understand.
we're talking about chuck, aren't we?
we're talking about chuck -- me and him.
I don't know what the hell you talking about 'cause this don't concern you.
dead girl's got to work out whatever she needs to work out, but you can't go dropping the "I killed your dad" bomb and expect happy golightly.
I've got a "here's what you should do.
leave her be, and while you leaving her be, there's somebody I need you to talk to.
the facts were these
an adjuster for uber-life life insurance, one victor narramore, was 46 years, 11 weeks, 5 days, 17 hours, and 3 minutes old when his body was scooped up by a snowplow on the 200 block of oak street.
unsettled by this particular new year's tiding, oak street homeowners association offered a reward to find victor narramore's killer.
anybody ever ask you why you wear that sweater?
my niece gave me this sweater last Christmas.
that thing's uglier than a chipmunk's ass.
he means the sweater, not your niece.
why would somebody give somebody a Christmas sweater for Christmas?
you can only wear it that day.
he means should only wear it that day.
Yeah. Either you got to take off what you got on to put it on or you got to wait another year for the next holiday season.
why are you going toe-to-toe with me on fashion?
only thing I want to hear from your peeper is, "happy holidays," and, "here's your rent."
happy holidays!
here's your rent.
feels light.
you just stronger than you think.
I can't move.
you're frozen solid.
hmm, so there is such a thing as a snowball's chance in hell.
you're not in hell, Mr. Narramore. Should you be?
Oh, no. No, no, no, of course not.
well, it really depends on who you're talking to.
who am I talking to?
angels of justice.
Oh, then I am in hell, aren't I?
who killed you, Mr. Narramore?
I don't know who killed me, but I do know how they killed me.
after a long day at the office, victor narramore was walking to his car when he heard someone approaching rapidly from behind.
Victor narramore didn't see who killed him, but he did see how he was killed, and he was, in fact, killed with kindness.
you were killed with kindness?
not the sentiment, which would have been lovely, but the word, which was scratched into the business end of a baseball bat.
somewhere between kindness and the morgue, somebody turned you into a corpsicle, and you got scooped up by a snowplow.
no idea why somebody would want to kill you?
well, i am an insurance adjuster.
we're more hated than parking enforcement.
how come?
it's my job to quantify people's lives and decide if they deserve a new gan.
no one wants to be told if they should live or die.
Hey, do i get to live now?
no.
now I got to make a list of people who wanted to get an organ but were turned down by victor narramore.
but the pie maker didn't care about victor narramore and his unattainable organs.
he only cared about chuck, out there, alone in the cold, cold world.
but what he didn't know was that she wasn't alone at all.
not ned.
in winter, everything is dampened and hushed sounds and smells
but not you, girl who smells like honey and death.
Hello, oscar.
I hope your bees are surviving the chill.
seem to be.
that explains the honey but not the death.
I'm cold.
I'm going in.
thank you.
this will keep you warm.
my sweater.
it's clean, if that's what you're worrying about. In fact, it's very clean.
I collected every last bit of anything that wasn't cashmere, even a little sample of your hair.
all right, this is making me very uncomfortable.
you mean up on a rooftop with a near stranger who's waxing on about collecting your hair?
Yes.
wait, did you shave digby's bum?
what is with you and that dog?
you both have the same scent.
you did shave digby's bum.
which reminds me, could I please have a larger sample of your hair?
Why? What are you gonna do with it?
stuff it in my pillow.
human hair is much softer than down.
I'm teasing you.
I'm just curious -- huh
why you and that dog aren't like anyone else.
hair can be telling about so many things.
unless you already know what the hair knows and want to tell me.
my hair doesn't know anything. Maybe it's you.
people smell strange smells all the time.
they don't even exist.
are you suggesting I have a neurological disorder that's affecting my olfactory glands?
you do spend a lot of time in the sewer.
some of us belong underground.
you can't have any of my hair.
then I guess the dog's ass shavings will have to do.
bees -- the ancient egyptians believed they were inexorably entwined with death.
they used honey to mummify their dead and left jars of it in the tombs for food in the afterlife.
you know a lot about bees.
and I suspect you know a lot about death.
boy, it's cold.
you know...
you could use a witch's bosom as a hot-water bottle on a day like today.
any sign of chuck?
and how are you today, olive?
I'm fine. Thanks for asking, ned.
that was a funny joke about the witch's bosom, olive.
well, thanks, ned.
and I appreciate you using the word "bosom."
why, ned?
cause it's less offensive than other words?
no, I just simply like the word "bosom."
I say it to myself all the time.
bosom, bosom, bosom.
I just can't help myself.
I'm a bosom-oholic.
are you done? - Think so.
you promise you don't know where she is?
why would I know where she is?
because I keep going over it in my mind, and chuck doesn't know many people, and you're not one of the many people chuck doesn't know.
have you slept at all?
did you know you have a tell when you lie?
do I? - You answer questions with questions.
maybe I know I have a tell, and I know you know I have a tell, and I'm doing it now to confuse you because you don't know what tell I'm telling.
but why would you go through the trouble of answering questions with questions and pretending to lie if you really don't know where she is?
can you tell me?
Victor narramore turned down 15 people for organ transplants.
of those 15 people, 3 are viable persons of interest.
why only 3 viable?
because 12 are not viable.
Ah, one of those viable persons of interest lives in the 200 block on oak street, named abner newsome.
got turned down for a new heart a year ago by victor narramore.
is abner newsome still alive?
hence "viable."
I should stay here and wait for chuck, just in case.
Oh, you don't want to talk to a sick kid.
no, I understand.
it's a hard, sad life.
are you really trying to make me feel guilty when I'm this depressed?
I'm trying to get you out of your depression.
you don't need me to talk to the living.
suit yourself.
but dead girl don't need you, either.
you're the last person in the world she wants to talk to, which is why she ain't here.
before I head out, I want you to take a mental picture of me, your friend olive, who's here with digby, a snapshot of loyal friends.
thank you.
did you take your picture?
Yes.
Oh, look, it's ned.
did you shave digby's
we don 't knowhow that happened.
okay, see ya.
been looking.
been hiding.
how much does olive know?
don't worry about what olive knows.
even if I told her the truth, that I died and you brought me back to life, she wouldn't believe me.
you don't know that.
Yes, I do, 'cause I told her, and she wouldn't believe me.
why would you do that?
because I needed to tell somebody the truth, even if they didn't believe me.
I wanted to tell someone the truth about who I am and what had happened to me......
and what you did to my dad.
can't we keep the truth between you and me?
it's hard to keep the truth between you and me when I can't look at you.
I remember that night when you came over after dad had died, and...
you wouldn't look at me.
Chuck, please.
do you know that no one could tell me how he died?
I thought it was the fickle finger of fate, but it wasn't the fickle finger of fate.
it was your fickle finger.
that one right there.
I didn't mean my finger to be fickle.
I didn't know what it would do.
I know. I've rationalized the whole thing.
it was like you were playing with a gun, and it accidentally went off and it killed my dad.
like that, except there's no gun and I wasn't playing.
my mom died...
and, yeah, I'm the kid who killed your dad, and I hate that.
I hate that, too.
but do you hate me?
I have to hate you a little just for a little while.
and I can't do that if you're still here.
I don't want you to hate me.
I should stay.
if you stay, I'll just end up hating you more.
just go.
Chuck considered how much easier circumstances would be if she had someone to talk to who wasn't the pie maker...
someone who might believe her secrets if she told them...
someone else who belonged underground.
hot on the trail of an ice-cold killer, Mr. Cod paid a visit to the third of his three persons of interest in the murder of uber-life life insurance adjuster victor narramore.
the facts were these
abner Newsome was a happy child for the first 34 seconds of his life, whereupon it was discovered that he suffered from a debilitating heart condition.
as the single mother of a sickly, surly child, emma newsome was a raw nerve, her son would often peel like a potato.
when I saw you coming up the block,
I thought you might be from the wish-a-wish foundation or some other charity or a celebrity or a celebrity representing a charity.
that's nice.
it's nice for your son to know there are people that care.
Yeah, caring is great.
love the caring.
know what would be even better?
not dying.
abner, this is emerson cox.
he's investigating a crime.
it's "cod."
I heard on the news that that narramore guy got whacked.
he turned me down for a good heart once, so he can pretty much suck it, I think.
you don't seem too bereft at his passing.
I'm not, not at all.
Oh, please, tell me I'm a suspect. Awesome.
cause -- 'cause you know what I did first?
I took a magic potion that made the tissue-paper sack I call my heart work, then I stepped on his neck with the soggy, atrophied breadsticks that used to be my legs.
my son is very sick, Mr. Cox.
it's "cod," and, uh, I can see that.
if you're not here to grant us a wish or give us some free merchandise, then I think you should leave.
don't let the door hit you on your big, oxygenated, blood-filled ass on the y out.
you pushing it.
if I piss you off, you gonna snee and kill me?
have a nice day!
if you have any more questions, I'll be right here...
or slumped in a pile on the floor.
good boy. Good boy!
Hey, why don't you leave a present up there on the porch for them, too.
everybody around here got an attitude.
having followed the frozen stiff from abner newsome's house to the morgue, emerson cod grew concerned.
I'm concerned.
about chuck?
about you and your mooning over dead girl.
you got to pull yourself together.
we got a corpsicle to question.
Yeah.
freezer burn. Go ahead.
bill richter, uber-life life insurance.
if you've got big problems, we've got bigger solutions.
that's life, uber-life.
another uber-life insurance agent.
actually, I prefer insurance adjuster.
it's my job to assess damage.
maybe it's time for a self-assessment.
Oh, this.
guess that's what happens when you're smacked with a bat.
any idea who smacked you?
no, but you might want to ask kevin.
Kevin? Kevin? - Kevin vanden eykel. We carpool.
Yeah, we'd just left the others and headed for my car, where I was fumbling for my keys, when, all of a sudden,
I hear him scream, "watch out"!
next thing you know, here I am.
where am I?
you're, um, in the morgue.
if I'm dead, why are you the one with the long face?
let me guess. Girl problem?
hell no. - Hell yes.
I could see it in his eyes.
what's her name?
I call her chuck, but that's not her real name.
it's actually kind of a funny story.
would you ask this fool how he ended up in a snowman?
sorry, I can't talk about this right now.
that's okay.
it'll come when you're ready.
till then, chin up, big guy.
I'm sorry.
I thought I'd pulled it together, and then I came apart.
well, your coming apart pulled apart this case.
we still don't know a damn thing about this killer.
we don't, but kevin vanden eykel might.
are you kevin vanden eykel?
Nope.
steve kaiser.
I've been covering kevin's cases since he went missing.
when did he go missing?
same night as bill richter and victor narramore.
in all probability, he's dead like them.
of course, the company's not gonna pay off on his policy until the police find a body, so his wife's been struggling to keep her head above water.
I'm surprised they didn't just cancel her insurance and put the final nail in her coffin.
sounds like you don't approve of how things are done around here.
who'd you say you work for, again?
we didn't. I'm a private investigator. This is my associate.
then I think I've said enough.
if you gentlemen will excuse me...
hold on. Bill richter's body was found in the front yard of a boy named abner newsome.
all we're trying to do is find out why.
from what we can gather, abner applied to uber-life several times.
was bill working on abner's case?
bill, victor, and kevin all rejected abner for a heart transplant.
that's something we in the private-eye business like to call "a pattern.
let's go.
asses.
excuse me?
I'm talking about the suits who run this place. Good god.
how many people have to pay the price before that boy finally gets a heart?
why don't you just approve his application?
because I'll lose my job.
besides, it's not up to me.
it's up to the numbers, and his number's almost up.
low survival odds plus exorbitant transplant costs equals bad business, and that's the bottom line around here.
hell, if this place has taught me anything, it's people are expendable.
I got your invitation.
I'm glad you came.
I was scared a little bit.
Chuck felt alive holding the dark secret of her death so close to the light of day.
I have a hypothesis.
hypothesize.
a cell starved for oxygen, as in death, is marked.
even after the life returns, the signature of the shock to the system remains.
how?
there's always the slightest whiff of ozone, like the fading memory of a dream.
do I smell of ozone?
your dog does.
did he die and come back?
that would be impossible.
people come back every day.
they fall into frozen lakes, have heart attacks, their lungs collapse.
then someone pulls them back from the edge.
I think I'd know if digby died.
maybe you didn't notice because you were dying, too.
that's pure conjecture, based solely on the hair of a dog's behind.
Chuck could feel her truth stepping out of the shadows, warming its toes in the sunshine, and the man from the sewer could sense it.
it can be so exhausting carrying a secret.
I need a pair of scissors.
tell me my secret.
anticipating the arrival of a third body, emerson cod and the pie maker returned to the house of the heartless boy.
ma'am, the two insurance adjusters that died were both linked to your boy.
we have reason to believe a third body's gonna show up on your lawn sometime soon.
that's not good.
Oh, no, that's real good.
cause this time, we're gonna be waiting outside to catch the iceman when he cometh.
thank goodness.
a boy with a heart like abner's doesn't need any more stress.
Mr. Cod, this is madeleine mclean.
she's a wish-a-wisher from the wish-a-wish foundation.
and this is bobo.
a bonobo.
I love a man who knows his monkeys.
the bonobo is the gentlest of primates.
they're great with sick children.
that's why I'm giving him to abner.
were you wishing for a cuddle?
actually, I was wishing for a butter knife so I could pop out its heart and use it as my own.
Oh, okay. N-no monkey. Bobo.
how about tickets to medieval times?
see, on the list of things I'd like, cuddling a monkey and going to medieval times are right next to constipation and diphtheria.
there must be some wish-a-wish wish you wish for.
Yeah, I wish you'd all just go away.
all righty, then.
I apologize for abner, but he's been feeling very sick lately.
I think he just wants to be alone.
Yeah, we'll be, uh, outside watching over you both tonight.
the only person with any real motive is abner's mom, but, hell, that's just cold stupid.
right.
what kind of killer leaves her victims in her own lawn?
we sit here long enough, we'll find out.
would you quit wiggle-warting?
you're steaming up the windows and giving the neighbors the wrong idea.
I can't help it.
my body's staked out here.
my mind's staked out where she is, wherever that is.
Oh, I know you ain't gonna start talking about dead girl on our stakeout.
what do you think my chances are of getting her back?
do I look like a damn ouija board to you?
what if steve kaiser was right, and life just adds up to one big calculation where you take all the good you've ever done and subtract all the bad?
after what I've done...
what if chuck and i don't add up?
Oh, you add up to zero.
zero?
as in zero interest in discussing it.
you don't understand.
Oh, I understand better than you think.
you feel like you -- like you messed up, like you just lost the only person who ever meant anything to you.
part of you feels like it's for the best, and like maybe you never even deserved her in the first place.
O-kay, maybe you understand, but there's something I can do to get chuck back.
I can give her back her father, if only to say goodbye.
the relationship between a father and his daughter is tenuous.
it's very fragile.
it could take a lifetime to sort out all the issues there.
and, what? You think you can just "happily ever after" it after one minute?
man, you a dreamer.
and you're a cynic.
I'm a father.
as in a priest?
as in a man with a daughter.
you have a daughter? Where is she? Why don't you ever
Nuh-unh, nuh-unh. Scratching an itch only makes it itchier.
this is my itch, and i sure as hell don't want you scratching it, understood?
understood.
no more scratching.
my itches or yours.
good.
emerson cod focused back on the case, little knowing someone else was focused on emerson and the pie maker.
Emerson! Wake up!
emerson, come on. Come on.
it feels like my head is gonna split in two.
it's carbon-monoxide poisoning.
someone put a potato in our tail pipe.
Oh, lord.
please tell me I ain't dead.
you're not dead.
and I can be not dead for longer than a minute?
there are no minutes involved.
you will continue to be not dead until you're dead, but I've never undeaded you at any point.
good.
you may be dying from breathing a poisonous gas, but dead
no. No.
Oh, hell.
realizing their lives were still lives, the pie maker and the private investigator could not say the same for the body surely frozen in the freshly made snowman.
see? I used to love snowmen.
the darling mermaid darlings overcame their incapacitating social phobias with the help of chuck's mood-enhancing pies.
but unbeknowt to all, this latest pie wasn't just dosed.
it was overdosed.
I have been craving this pie all day.
that's not what I've been doing all day.
we're making costumes for our next tour.
if we have a next tour.
none for me, thanks. I don't like vanilla.
I didn't ask either of you if you wanted pie.
I'm in training.
the aunts had begun to hope again, which left olive with one simple wish.
I sure wish charlotte could see you like this.
maybe charlotte can see us like this.
evidently, her ghost is about.
Really?
someone's seen her ghost?
meanwhile Chuck considered the risk she'd taken by sharing her secret with the man from below the ground.
she wondered what he would discover in the swath of brunette truth she had given up.
and then...
Hello, chuck.
you sneak up on people.
that could get you inadvertently bludgeoned with a rolling pin.
I find a bludgeoning to be a unique sensory experience.
I taste pennies and smell but toast.
I came to return the hair.
my hair?
it's a gesture of trust.
you know everything there is to tell about the hair.
I'd rather hear about it from you.
I think you want to tell me.
in that moment, chuck realized her hate and sadness had begun to fall.
there was only one person with whom she wished to share the burden of an impossible secret...
should have asked the hair while you had the chance.
the pie maker.
in bulgaria, we were en route to a competition when a band of gypsies stopped the train.
they came through the cabin and stole one woman's watch and her soul.
they didn't take her soul.
well, she was ornery and vacant after they left.
because they took her watch!
I can't imagine the adventures you've been on.
Oh, my, lily.
did you eat t-the whole pie?
are you feeling all right?
what did you put in that pie?
just vanilla.
Oh, there's no vanilla in that pie.
as olive wondered what exactly she did put in lily and vivian's pie, emerson cod, private investigator, drew an intriguing conclusion.
we are giant, enormous idiots, and don't you say "ginormous," 'cause that ain't a word.
whoever plugged our tail pipe waited for us to pass out and then put the body in the lawn.
Mrs. Newsome was peeling potatoes yesterday.
maybe we were wrong about her.
Yeah, maybe she has gone all blood simple, hiding her victims all up in snowmen.
Kevin would know.
Yeah, let's ask him.
or not.
I'm not touching that.
fine with me. Let's talk to miss newsome.
what happened?
the insurance company rejected abner again.
nice meeting everyone.
now, if you'll pardon me,
I'll be sucking pureed turkey through a straw while my organs putrefy, but, hey, you enjoy yourselves.
do you know who it was who called from the insurance company?
Why? You want to send him a card, too?
send who a card?
Mr. Kaiser.
the wish-a-wish lady called.
after I told her about abner, she said she wanted to let Mr. Kaiser know about her foundation.
the wish-a-wish lady.
she's a kill-a-killer.
emerson cod and the pie maker arrived at uber-life life insurance in an attempt to find steve kaiser...
what are the chances of that?
before an act of kindns found him.
what are the odds of you having a daughter?
cause you've never actually mentioned her before.
first off, you're like my grandfather.
you slow down when you talk, so stop talking.
second off, when I said what I said, it wasn't said in the "we need to talk more about this later" kind of way.
it was said in the "I regret what I'm saying."
there must be "a potato in the tail pipe" kind of way, so stop talking.
as emerson and the pie maker closed in on the killer wish maker, the wish maker had already found her next snowman.
stupid frozen door.
Oh, shoot.
a ding.
I just didn't want you to think -- - Stop.
I've been so focused on myself lately.
stop the car!
I'm gonnneed you to stop wildin' on the insurance adjuster, ma'am.
what if I have a gun, too?
Oh, you don't have to do this.
Madeleine, please put the gun and the bat down or definitely the gun.
is that your wish?
I'm sorry?
because granting wishes is my job.
the facts were these
madeleine Mclean was a dream come true at the wish-a-wish foundation, where she provided succor with suckers, coaxed chuckles from colics.
but she met her match in abner newsome, the little boy who lacked a heart.
I'm m...
why don't you tell me about your super-special self, sweetheart?
that basket smells like old pus.
and though she tried and tried...
I said, "lap dance," not "tap dance."
there must be something you wish for.
Yeah, I wish those insurance-company jerks who keep rejecting me would drop dead.
until she realized the boy without a heart wanted revenge.
as madeleine mclean prepared to grant one last deadly desire, bobo the bonobo monkey had a wish of its own
to play with a ball on a stick called the shifter.
and so its wish was granted...
as was the wish of madeleine mclean, for, though her sanity was torn asunder by a boy named abner newsome and her body was torn apart by a bonobo named bobo, her heart was still intact, which allowed her to grant one final wish, and that was for abner newsome to have a change of heart madeleine mclean's heart.
the pie maker came upon another heart in need of repair.
there's no headstone for me yet.
we wait a year.
how did you know I was here?
because I've been everywhere else first.
is "a little while" over yet?
because I can't bear the thought of you hating me still.
I feel better.
I have an idea.
no.
I thought, for one minute
I'm not gonna bring him back just so you can watch me kill him again.
I can't do that to you.
I won't.
Chuck wished things were different.
she wished she knew her father.
she wished she knew her mother.
she wished the pie maker could comfort her by holding her close.
not all those wishes were meant to be, but one of them was.
I love the quiet on a snowy night.
no, I feel fine.
much better now.
stop it.
you're the one who should be cold.
Mm-mmm, that was good pie.
when charlotte was young, after we moved in, she used to stand right there where you're floating and watch the snow with me.
at night, while she slept, I'd sneak into the backyard and make two snow angels.
she never said anything, and I'd always play dumb.
she thought they were her parents.
one was her father.
the other one was me.
you?
I'm charlotte's mother.
long weekends at the Longborough school for boys were a quiet time, as most children went home to their families.
there were those students, however, who gathered not out of friendship, but because they had nowhere else to go.
young Ned found himself a member of this elite group.
as there was very little else to do, Ingmar's room became a center of activity.
place your bets, gentlemen.
he had arrived at boarding school with a professionally certified and balanced roulette wheel and a tawny owl named Casper.
all young Ned had to wager was the box of chocolates he'd hastily snuck into his suitcase the day his father dropped him off at boarding school.
it was then he noticed the note tucked into the box.
he realized the individually wrapped chocolates currently in play had been intended as a gift to him from his dearly departed mother.
bets are closed.
like many beginning players, young Ned bet on both red and black but failed to consider the double zero on the wheel.
double zed. House wins.
he lost everything.
the lesson was clear in gambling, no matter how well you think you know the odds, there's always an outcome you can't see coming.
during the years that followed, the pie maker avoided taking gambles, with a few notable exceptions.
he invested his life savings in a bakery at a time when carbohydrates had fallen completely out of fashion, and, more importantly, he had gambled on the love of his childhood sweetheart, the girl next door who had returned from the dead.
try this.
like the fork.
like being alive.
it's a new flavor -- spring passion fruit.
now, I know it's not spring here, but it is in New Zealand, which is, uh, exotic and upside down, which is how we could serve it.
betting on Chuck had made the pie maker happier than he had ever been.
we'll put it on the menu.
I like daring Ned.
it seems since you arrived, cautious Ned has left the building.
uh, who's the new guy in the booth?
the handsome, brooding older man with a sensual twinkle?
Plus, he smells good.
he mumbled something odd to me earlier.
there was no word that completely described the feeling the square-shouldered older man had given the pie maker.
do you ever shiver when you pee?
that's how I felt when he spoke.
more coffee? - Thanks.
pie is delicious. As good as your mother's.
he said that? Well, did he know your mother?
I didn't ask.
a stranger says a strange thing in passing, chances are I misheard him or misunderstood.
maybe when he said "your mother's pie," he didn't mean my mother, he meant everyone's mother
the iconic, all-American mother created by advertisers and politicians as a shorthand for family values and a longing for baked goods.
would that make you shiver?
if someone said something to me about my family, it would give me the piss-jitters, but I'd ask him about it, not hide in a kitchen.
I'm not hiding.
I think he's cute.
I'm... probably making a mountain out of a molehill over a random comment I probably misheard, and I'm hoping to offset any awkwardness you are or will be feeling by providing your slice of three-plum on the house.
you're a nervous talker... like your D.
this complicates things. You may need to pay for the pie.
look. Dwight Dixon. I was a friend of your father's 25 years ago.
I mean, you are Ned, am I right? - Nope.
Yes, you are, silly.
I'm Olive. - Hi, Olive.
I'm Kitty. Kitty Pimms. Nice to meet you.
uh, so you knew Ned's parents?
Yeah, back, uh, when they were dating.
it was the peak of peach season.
she baked a brown-sugar crust. Your dad didn't have a chance.
they never mentioned you.
Oh, I was in the service with your dad, back before you were born.
you know what? Your dad didn't like to reminisce.
probably a lot of things he didn't talk about.
sounds familiar.
I'm actually trying to find him. I was hoping you could help.
really love to see him.
you got his face, you know, especially around the eyes.
the pie maker had hoped never to be likened to his father, whether it be around the eyes...
I'm afraid we lost touch...
or the heart.
20 years ago.
Oh, that's a shame. Any thoughts on where I might look?
Nope.
and though you're obviously speaking from a good and helpful place, it's not good and helpful...
to me, so...
as Chuck marveled at the pie maker's refusal to help search for his only parent, Emerson Cod marveled at the digestive coma produced by beef balls and curried cuttlefish from the dim sum restaurant downstairs.
his phone silenced, Emerson knew the world of clients and murders would soon be lost in the cloud of a power nap.
help me Emerson Cod!
what the hell?
arriving downstairs in search of a new case, the P. I. Stumbled on one from his past...
Simone Hundin, obedience expert and widow of deceased, polygamous dog breeder Harold Hundin.
while investigating her husband's murder, Emerson and Simone had forged a close bond.
Simone. What have you been up to?
it was a friendship that had very nearly, but not quite, become...breeding.
my bubblegum's in heat. It was a long night. Sit.
but what a treat bumping into you.
I didn't know you were a dim sum connoisseur.
best pork buns in town. My office is upstairs. It's a dangerous combination.
bun?
no, I'm really trying to, you know
the private investigator considered how his inescapable desire to be obedient to this obedience trainer was at once thrilling and terrifying.
then he remembered his case.
Hey, did you send me a message in a cookie?
wasn't me.
I find there are more reliable ways to send a message.
leave it.
it's been a pleasure, Mr. Cod.
perhaps we'll cross paths again.
Fortunaty, Emerson had a distraction from his conflicting impulses -- a client.
excuse me, ma'am?
I'm Emerson Cod, the private investigator from upstairs.
did you by any chance contact me?
I've seen your billboards.
my name is Lai Di.
lady?
lai Di.
I'm married to Bao, the chef.
picking up some things of his.
you're married to the chef?
ma'am, may I just say -- your husband's pork buns make me glad to be alive.
the man's a true artist.
well, not anymore. He's dead now.
but I'll hire you to find who killed him.
the facts were these
lai Di and her husband, Bao, immigrated from Beijing with the hope of opening their own restaurant.
he demanded privacy while he worked...
both to eliminate distractions and protect his unique recipes.
but even with his daughter working as a waitress, Bao could never save enough money for his own restaurant.
it was after a 16-hour shift that Lai Di had noticed Bao could not sleep.
something had him terrified.
Bao chose to reply in english.
pressure! - Pressure?
lai Di would remember Bao's misgiving as ironic.
police were satisfied bao's death han been aaccident, but Lai Di was convinced there had been foul play.
okay, let's be delicate. He may not speak english.
and with the pipe the way it is, I don't know if he'll speak at all.
hello...
you speak Chinese?
watch out.
please, don't hurt me! I'm sorry I lose the bet!
look, we're not gonna hurt you!
what bet?
gambling at the dim sum!
now someone's going to kill me.
going to kill you?
I don't know how they're going to do it, but they're going to do it for sure!
Yeah, yeah, who -- who wants to kill you?
who were you gambling with?
I tell you that, and I'm a dead man!
see, what we need now is a mirror.
I got to get out of here!
Bao, no! Wait!
Ouch.
as it appeared the bun steamer's buns were steamed over a bet at the dim sum, Emerson Cod returned to the restaurant for a chat with bao's daughter.
I don't know why my mother hired you.
my father's death was an accident.
your mother had a hunch.
I could gold-leaf my bathroom with whai made off mother-hunches.
and what I really need to know is are those the new chiu-chao dumplings? May I?
pork... dried shrimp.
chives, mushrooms... in a glutinous rice flour.
girl, your father could make a grown man cry.
this is Rubbie Wu, my fiance?
also manager of the dim sum.
son, you got a hell of a restaurant.
I'm a lucky man in many ways.
Mr. Cod, right? You work upstairs.
cuttlefish, beef balls, and taro dumplings every sunday at noon.
I'm sorry about your loss, both in the human and gastronomical sense.
speaking of the genius who was your father, is it possible he was also a degenerate gambler?
I heard he was killed over a bet.
he didn't have time for anything but work.
least, as far as I know.
my father and I weren't very close.
what about gambling here in the restaurant, you know, with employees or maybe customers?
we're just a dim sum restaurant.
if bao was in trouble 'cause of gambling, it didn't happen here.
so, it sounds like Mei didn't seem too broken up about dear old dead dad.
didn't waste many tears.
that being said, I searched the entire restaurant...
there's no basement or secret card room or the like.
maybe bao meant something else when he said he lost a bet.
maybe bao had a pipe through his head and we're chasing smoke.
I'll call you when I find a lead.
what are you doing? - I just
Dwight stopped by again. Didn't say much.
just that kind, warmhearted smile with the crinkly eyes that say, oh, I wish I could find my old friend, Ned's dad, before I die alone.
I know that face. It's the ...
I'm still waiting to hear why you won't help your father's friend face.
no, it's a "you don't know my face as well as you think" face.
I keep my feelings about my father behind a door that's closed for so long, it's wallpapered over, and you can't see the seams.
and that's how I like it.
Dwight showing up is like a corner peeling.
and I see that peeling corner, and I want to rip it off.
you wouldn't if you knew what was underneath.
in my case, it's a colorful mix of anger, chronic distrust, and misplaced guilt.
my mom's been lying to me for three decades about who she is.
we have a whole pile of stink to work out, and I would if I could, but I can't.
but you can, if you could, and you should.
what is that?
it's my clue pad for writing down clues.
I love that you have a clue pad.
my father's address -- you can give it to Dwight.
that's as much as I can do.
h-how long have you had this?
a while.
by "a while," the pie maker meant 20 years, 11 months, 3 weeks, 5 days, and 6 hours since he had gotten word, whilst away at boarding school, that his father had moved on and started a new family... without him.
can I help you?
this is Hua Jiang. He overheard Emerson at the restaurant.
Yeah, he said that there's been illegal gambling at the dim sum since it opened in the days of Prohibition.
he says they'd pull the shades and play cards for money all night long.
and when your luck was running, you'd have a woman on each arm and all the milk you could drink.
milk?
hmm, might not be the right word. My Mandarin's a little rusty.
this went on until the police finally caught on and shut them down.
but he says they always found a way to keep the card game going.
I've already searched the whole damn restaurant.
well, there were gin joints in the '20s that used to have underground passages and secret panels, and you used to have to know the password -- like "Antwerp" or "fiddlesticks."
what?
I was pecting Emerson to say something snarky.
are we spying? I love spying. - Shut it.
isn't that... - Simone?
that dog lady you dated? Is that why we're hiding?
we ain't hiding, and we didn't date. - You wanted to.
Yeah, and then I didn't. - Why you didn't?
no kidding. She's gorgeous.
there are complicated issues in this situation that you nd to know nothing about, except that their complexities are so complex, it makes this shallow conversation absurd.
strange.
you calling my romantic life "strange"?
no. It's strange none of the people at that table are eating.
as they continued to observe the diners who were not dining, several unusual details became apparent...
all plates at the table were covered with a lid.
before serving, the waitress would spin the food on a lazy susan.
each diner took five plates...
then placed a number of soybeans in the center of the table.
let's see 'em.
while this behavior did not seem consistent with diners enjoying a dim sum dinner, when the scene was reimagined in a dif wayrent, it began to make sense.
I do love winning.
those folks are playing poker with food.
faced with a table full of unsavory poker players, Emerson Cod summoned a steely bravery acquired from years of P. I. work, as he questioned what was, for him, the group's most intimidating player
given the amount of cash you left with in your doggie bag last night,
I'd say this wasn't the first time you been gambling at the dim sum.
aggression is a sign of fear, Mr. Cod.
sometimes aggression is just a sign of being aggressive, which I will be until I catch who killed Bao Ting.
now tell me about dim sum-style poker.
it's quite simple.
you give the password to the hostess, which is "hao shou yun" and means "fortune" in Mandarin.
you buy in at the table.
each plate is a card, and the meats are the four suits
shrimp, pork, chicken, beef.
the appetizers represent different numbers.
other than that, it's traditional five-card draw.
except you can eat your cards.
which is what you do when the police arrive.
did you know Bao Ting?
his steamed buns blurred the line between eating and sex, but we were not acquainted.
any of these regulars seem like the type to push a pipe through your skull if you owed 'em money?
shrimpboy's a gangster in charge of running the table and paying off the manager.
Anson Chen did eight years in the state pen for armed robbery.
jin Quin is a thug for hire, will do anything for a few dollars.
Louie Lu strangled his mother-in-law, got off on a technicality.
Jim... is a plumber.
they all take gambling seriously, and they're all dangerous.
any of them could have done it.
what about you?
please.
I was at a dog show that night, which is 800 alibis
1, 200, if you include canines. Are we finis?
I've made a career out of training animals to overcome and subdue their instincts.
that being said, without raw instinct, life is nothing more than a series of empty tricks.
you pretending this is all business between us...seems like an empty trick.
something I learned the hard way...whenever I'm with someone, the more I begin to feel...
inadequate? - Never.
Tongue-tied? - No.
aroused? - Ye-- I'm just saying...
the more I'm into somebody, the greater the odds that it's gonna end badly.
and based on that, how would we end?
extremely badly.
you hear what I just said?
this was the first time the private investigator had ever been ordered to...
come.
as emerson went against what he was sure was his better judgment, chuck and olive did the same by paying a visit to Ned's father.
pie delivery! - Surprise random pie delivery!
just a minute.
this is a good idea. Right?
sounded like a good idea when you described it to me.
Yeah, imagine if we'd have dragged Ned here and we find out that his dad's still an emotional disaster?
and it turns out he's older and crankier and drinks $6 bottles of sour mash?
Ohh, Ned would have a trump card of an I-told-ya-so.
come in!
it'll take just a minute.
o-okay. All right.
Oh, thank you.
it's not my fault.
the stupid false bottom keeps jamming.
it works when I do it.
Oh, twins! Oh, I love twins!
I-I'm Ralston. This is Maurice.
we have a big show coming up.
Oh, actually, we were looking for an older man that lives here?
he won a pie in a raffle. We have a raffle every week. It's very exciting.
the only older man was our dad, and he hasn't lived here for a while.
you sad your... "dad"? - Yeah.
he hasn't lived here in a few years. He kinda... disappeared.
then our mom shacked up with someone else, so we kept the house.
it was then that Chuck and Olive realized...
you have the same eyebrows as him!
they do! They do!
I said that twice -- once for each of you.
you have seen twins before, right?
Oh, yeah. She didn't mean the same as each other. She meant...
a pause as they considered how the pie maker might react if he knew they had discovered his half-brothers.
dad must be very handsome. - Oh, yeah. Enjoy the pie.
Thanks. - Bye.
Simone come and gone, Emerson felt flushed with a post-coital sense of achievement and renewed powers of mental clarit he spotted something.
who are you, busboy in every picture?
and, looking more closely...
meet me at the dim sum.
three reasons I want to speak to that busboy.
one, he makes $5 an hour, and he's wearing a $2, 300 Omega deville prestige quartz wristwatch.
two, he's always hanging around that poker table.
and, three, he's been watching us ever since we came in here.
since we came here. Where were you?
gambling. For you. And I hit a jackpot
but, um, maybe not the kind you'd like.
what other kind is there?
Busboy's making a run for it. Let's go.
how could you go to my dad's house without telling me?
I can't believe you didn't tell me you have brothers. - Half-brothers.
two half-brothers, which is like one whole one, and, anyway, they're family, and your dad did the same thing to them.
and, Ned, they have your eyebrows, and they do parlor magic!
so, Maurice, he jumps into one trunk, and then Ralston jumps out of the other one.
Maurice and Ralston?
you didn't even know their names?
I'm glad dad got so fun and creative with naming after I left. Goodbye, Ned.
Hello, Mercutio and Ribald! - Maurice and Ralston!
that's what happens in a second marriage.
people loosen up, drop their baggage, and live a little.
I was the baggage.
Busboy's not in the kitchen.
Hey, wait a minute. - Yeah, right, over there.
this is where Bao worked his magic.
it's terrible that your dad left you, but it's not your brothers' fault.
it's not even half their fault. Why not try to get to know them?
I know other nice people my father didn't abandon me for.
Oh, no, too much pressure.
no, this isn't good!
what is that?
that is a newly repaired bun steamer!
watch out!
who shrieked?
I might have shrieked.
it sounded like it came from over there.
I think I found him. It's the busboy.
you think just 'cause you dead, you ain't gonna tell us what you was up to, but you are so wrong.
what the hell's that?
I believe it's a three-foot length of pipe.
I wonder if that's excluded under "special circumstances."
what "special circumstance"?
my life insurance policy.
that's what I do -- investigate policy claims.
I'm Perry long with Dawson & Stubbs... previously.
well, perry, judging by the man-made crimp in the pipe,
I think we looking at your garden-variety premeditated murder.
nice! It's a solid payout.
listen, if you're an insurance investigator, what the hell you doing posing as a busboy?
working undercover.
checking out a suspiciousolicy claim by a chef named Bao Ting we know Bao.
Bao took out a $200, 000 life insurance policy e day before he died.
what are we, idiots?
who's the beneficiary?
his daughter. Name's Mei. She works at the restaurant.
Thanks, Perry.
you think he left me money?
I'll believe it when I see it.
well, 200 grand's a lot of dough.
maybe enough for somebody who felt ignored and neglected to cash in?
will you excuse me? I have a table waiting.
wait, wait. Hold on a second. I
since I'm waiting on an order, maybe you ought to let her do her job.
Yes. Good idea. - Yeah, you right.
and that is shrimpboy. He runs the poker table.
he didn't like us talking to Mei.
maybe they're all in on it together. - Yeah.
Mr. Cod? Food to-go.
I didn't order this.
meet me across the street alone.
although the handwriting was familiar to Emerson, as it turned out, the author was a surprise.
you think I killed my father?
then why would I send you the fortune cookie the first time asking for help?
your mother sent me that cookie.
No!
I sent you the cookie knowing she was there that day collecting my dad's belongings.
I wanted her to run into you.
I knew she was suspicious of how dad died.
why couldn't you just hire me?
because shrimpboy watches me!
I know all his secrets, but mom doesn't know anything, not even about the gambling.
if he knew I was talking to you now...
that I'll tell you about the bet my father lost.
did you say "bet"?
the facts were these -- chasing money for his own restaurant at the dim sum poker table, Bao had gambled away his life savings.
he then begged the other gamblers to let him play on credit.
shrimpboy agreed, on one condition
if Bao lost the next hand, his daughter would be forced to marry shrimpboy's socially handicapped cousin Rubbie, manager of the dim sum.
20 minutes later, Mei was engaged.
and since shrimpboy believed the terms of a bet should be followed to the letter, he kept a close watch on Mei.
it's the wrong bet.
Bao gambled away his daughter's hand in marriage, but so far, Mei's kept her end of the bargain. There's no motive.
no way she's gonna stay in some kind of an arranged marriage.
she ain't going anywhere, not as long as she's under shrimpboy's thumb.
we got to prove that shrimpboy killed Bao, and to do that, we got to question shrimpboy.
but there are bodyguards involved -- very big ones.
maybe Simone can help. - Simone can't help.
I thought you talked to her.
or did you more than talk?
you did more than talk.
we decided to cool things off as a mutual agreement amicably reached by two highly mature adults!
excuse me.
what's the matter with you?
I owe you an apology.
is this an apology for going to Ned's dad's house?
and if so, can I please get in on it? Because I, too, am very sorry.
I was thrown that you went behind my back to look for a man who made my tender, formative years pure misery.
that said, I appreciate the apology.
well, we weren't gonna tell you anything if we didn't have good news.
your brothers are friendly and very cute -- not that you care about that, but I thought it qualified as good news.
especially the "brothers" and the "friendly" part.
Yeah, and it was wrong to be sneaky.
I was trying not to be pushy and replacing "sneaky" with "pushy" was a big mistake, - but... - "but"?
but I know you.
you say you don't want to feel connected, but I don't believe that.
I mean, everyone needs family.
you're my family.
and you, to a slightly lesser degree.
Thanks, to a slightly lesser degree.
I've spent my life not having things in common with my father, which is a good thing.
but if I reach out to my brothers, I'm betting it'll make my dad feel good, wherever he is.
I don't want that.
if that seems petty and vindictive and small, think of it as an homage to my father and the tiny part of us that is the same.
as Chuck and Olive pondered the distance ned put between himself and his past, Emerson pondered ways of getting closer to shrimpboy.
while tracking the potentially murderous gangster, the P. I. came up against something far more frightening
the mutual decision to let things "cool off" had not, in fact, been mutual.
but as he gazed up at the stars, his thoughts turned to his favorite warm, puffy pastries and the delicious surprises hidden inside.
and then he got an idea.
Emerson's plan involved a pot of green tea and Chinese herbs which Mei had supplied.
when ingested, the herbs were known to cause an uncomfortable fullness of the bladder.
little cousin wins again.
how 'bout that, huh?
boss? I got an uncomfortable fullness of the bladder.
Yeah, me -- me too.
I'm sorry, we're closing.
if I said we was here for the "hao shou yun" special?
same for me, darlin'.
that's right.
what's up, players? Which one of y'all be shrimpboy?
depends. Who's asking?
who's asking" is Jimmy the ace.
Ricky the hammer will vouch for me. We did time in the joint together.
where is Ricky, that lovable cutthroat?
never heard of him.
and this game... is full.
Yeah, well, uh, that's too bad, 'cause, uh, the sucker behind me got pockets so deep, he write a check and the bank bounce.
he's a grade-a fish.
I thought I'd bring him in here so we can pick him clean.
Rubbie, why don't you and Louie sit this one out?
Yes, Rubbie.
have a seat, player. It's a grand buy-in.
hope that's not a problem.
Oh, I always carry around some loose change.
damn, woman, you got the kung fu grip.
ain't you the shrimpboy won himself a bride in a poker game?
I heard about that. I thought, that fella needs to get out more.
there's better ways to meet girls.
I was playing her dad. Girl wasn't for me.
see, my cousin ain't too hot with the ladies, so I did him a favor.
Yeah, I bet her daddy was pretty angry when he lost that bet, huh?
well, if he was, why'd he play the hand in the first place?
see, around here, a bet's sacred.
your word is all you got.
woman!
bet's to you, new guy. $300 to stay in.
Oh, is that all?
you can raise.
uh, no, I like to begin with an insignificant sum, like this, and then work my way up to the real money.
Yeah, speaking of real money if I was you, I'd have kept right on betting with that fool.
he sound like an easy mark.
Oh, he came back, felt guilty about his daughter having to marry my cousin.
said he wanted to win her freedom back.
so it wasn't about money this particular time.
he was just trying to help his daughter.
except he had nothing to bet with. So I told him to get lost.
yo, you or what? - Oh, yeah, yeah.
all right. Let's switch 'em.
Hey, somebody! Open up!
keep walkin'. I love gongs! Nothing wrong with that.
the bodyguards still indisposed, the private investigators considered their latest clue
that the bet that had gotten Bao killed had not been with shrimpboy after all, but with someone else.
Bao wanted to win back Mei's freedom.
if shrimpboy wouldn't play, there's always someone else bao could have played against.
you mean Rubbie? Yeah.
Bao would've gone directly to her fianc?
to try to win Mei back from him.
time to put up or shut up.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
let's do this.
pork buns, shrimp dumplings, full house.
beef pot stickers, straight to the nine.
Bao had life insurance. What if he gambled that?
I mean, Mei's the beneficiary, but if Rubbie marries her, then he gets the money.
and Rubbie wouldn't collect as long as Bao was alive.
at last, the truth was clear.
Rubbie murdered Bao.
beef and sticky buns -- empty. You bluff.
we better hurry up and finish this business and then call the police.
what's with the whispering? Show the damn cards.
Oh, yeah.
10 high.
shrimp dumplings, four of a kind.
winning hand.
I won? Yeah, I won!
time to cash out.
I got bad circulation.
right, honey?
Hey, crab cake, you help him, you're an accessory, and I'm not talking Gucci handbag.
I'm talking hard time in the pen, the joint, the hoosegow, the forbidden city.
my cousin won a bet, and around here...
a bet is sacred.
what? I'm... just repeating what he said.
the facts were these -- Bao's desperate plea for a chance to win his daughter's freedom was paired with an unfortunate lack of funds.
when shrimpboy refused, rubbie suggested bao simply wager the payout from a life insurance policy.
if Rubbie won the hand, he would marry Mei and wait for Bao to die before claiming his reward.
Rubbie won the poker game with an amazing straight flush.
Bao had failed his daughter and was devastated.
even more devastating Bao awared next realization, that his future son-in-law demanded payment...immediately.
Papa was risking his life for me.
I wouldn't even speak to him.
it's not your fault.
I thought I knew my father, but I didn't know him at all.
it struck the pie maker, he'd always believed his father's actions spoke for themselves.
but maybe he was wrong.
speak of the devil.
nobody locked the door?
I don't think this would be the best time.
and when would be the best time?
certainly not earlier, when you dived into your car to hide from me.
no, see, you don't understand.
I require honesty, loyalty, and respect, qualities you've done an extraordinary job of not showing.
so let's try a new set of rules.
from now on, you will not speak to me... - but I -- ...
or call me. - But I -- ...
or come within 20 feet. - But I
and stop calling me "but I"!
lady.
what's going on?
we have a plane to catch.
No! No!
bubblegum, stop begging!
do you have food in your pocket? - No.
you do, don't you?
what are you talking about?
I was waiting on you when you beat shrimpboy at poker.
and I bet you beat him because you had the winning pork bun in your pocket.
you're a cheater.
cheater, cheater, cheater, cheater. Ch-cheater!
Yeah, and you know he was cheating when he played Bao.
and around here, a bet is sacred. Right?
out of my way!
while there were things shrimpboy could forgive, such as homicide, kidnapping, d ilanlegal poker, he drew the line at cheating.
in part, it was the countless hands of poker he'd lost to Rubbie in the years since childhood, now seen in a different light.
as Rubbie had cheated Bao, shrimpboy agreed the bet was nonbinding.
mei and her friends were free to go.
and Mei's engagement was disengaged.
Ah, sparkly.
because shrimpboy believed that all games are meaningless unless we risk something real.
Rubbie risked something real, and what he gained, as Olive predicted, was a visit to the hoosegow.
after the insurance company made a grudging payout to Mei, she shared it with her mother, who shared it with Emerson payment for a job well done.
still, Emerson was forced to acknowledge it had been job not so well done where Simone was concerned.
damn it, woman!
whatever it is, say it quickly.
look, you all about control. Now, I'm not gonna deny that's a turn-on.
but you never show your cards.
I figured if I went all-in, I'd be out on the street somewhere with a tin cup and a borrowed blanket.
you with me?
for about 10 more seconds.
but when you barged into the restaurant to tell me off, well, that was a whole new Simone, - because that meant you were... - hiding a shred of vulnerability?
well, hell, a shred's better than nothing.
all I'm saying is...you show me your cards, I'll show you mine.
it struck Emerson that while some people are terrified of a gamble and others can't say no to one, the best approach lies somewhere in the middle.
I would ask what changed your mind...
Except?
except you haven't rang the doorbell yet, which would prove that you have changed your mind.
all right, anything I say now is tempting fate.
it's easier to make assumptions about dad and why he did what he did than admit I don't know.
I don't know my family, or what it would be like to know them.
and the finding-out part... makes me a little queasy.
well, whatever happens, I'll be right here, okay?
Thanks.
come on. Come on.
Hello? - I'm Ned.
I thought I'd stop by because...
basically, we have the same dad.
as the brothers gazed at each other for the first time, the pie maker sensed this gamble would pay off in ways he could never predict.
and from his vantage point across the street, Dwight agreed.
awakened by loneliness-induced insomnia, he found himself in desperate need of comfort.
and comfort for Ned meant -- pie.
the risks were great, but young Ned rationalized his rogue impulse-baking as sheep-counting.
what harm could come of a single pie, in the dark of night, with all the evidence ingested?
he was caught in flagrante delicto by one Eugene Mulchandani, who immediately joined him in the act.
Ned and Eugene were unprepared for what happened next.
the aroma of freshly baked pie wafting through boarding-school halls awakened an entire class who had but one thing in common.
they were all far from home and need comfort.
the longing and homesickness which filled the school like a plague was magically lifted with every bite.
and the party began.
until the party stopped, and young Ned learned that even a forkful of immediate gratification can lead to a world of grave consequences.
a lesson to be learned again years later at the grave of currently dead father of Chuck, the woman he loved.
ready?
I'm ready, I think.
wait. -- What?
if we both have half a minute, then you go first.
no, no, you go first. If you spill over the first 30 seconds, then no biggie.
as opposed to spilling over the second 30 seconds, which is yes biggie.
I budgeted every second. I won't spill.
that's not enough seconds. You should have all 60.
we don't need to fact-find about Dwight. I don't know what i was thinking.
you were thinking that you were trying to protect us from a mysterious, potentially dangerous man.
you go first.
no, you go. This is awkward.
go first, or I'm gonna hit you with the shovel. -- Okay.
hello.
Hi, Mr. Charles. Or should I call you Charles? It doesn't matter.
it's me -- Ned. I lived across the street when I was a little boy.
it's me -- Charlotte. Um, you've been dead for 20 years.
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.
can you put them on hold for just a second and tell us.
is Dwight Dixon a dangerous man? -- Oh, yeah.
Oh, no. He stole Chuck's.
I still call your daughter "Chuck" still, like when I was 9. -- 15
no, I was 9. -- Seconds.
uh, Dwight stole your pocket watch and left a veiled threat about exposing a very big secret.
which he knows that we probably don't want exposed.
Oh, if he's got the watch, you got nothing to worry about.
the threat's his insurance policy.
now, you don't say nothing, he'll return the favor.
good to know. You're up.
the pie maker's gift of life lasted for one precious minute only.
a minute he eagerly shared with the Chuck of his life.
to give her but half a minute to catch up on a lifetime with a father long lost.
30 seconds were all he could give, and not a second more.
are you awake?
as Chuck soundlessly broke the bonds of her plastic-wrap embrace.
and snuck away to see to business unattended, Vian waited for Wight Dixon.
gentleman caller, unaware her sister Lily chased him off their front porch hours earlier.
at the come and sleep hotel, sister lily would make certain Dwight Dixon.
gentleman caller, would never call again.
way I see this, we both got something you want.
what would that be, my spicy cocktail?
I got my daughter's watch and you got your insides where you want 'em.
you're gonna dig up Charlotte's grave and you're gonna put this watch back where you found it.
after you tell me your real story.
well. It all began when I was conceived in the sweat and sawdust of a traveling carnival.
my mother was an acrobat named
I GOT...
and Chuck seemed to be waiting for something else altogether.
I'm declaring it an emotional snow day.
but you love that cook-off. And you and Olive didn't get to go last year.
I chose not to go last year. I was busy.
Yeah, b-because of me.
I love being busy because of you, and I'm looking forward to being busy.
because of you for the rest of the day.
you can't do what you did last night and not be a little...
well, believe me, I feel plenty whelmed, but, um, not overly.
overly is on its way, probably looking in the window right now.
you had to say "hello, again" and "goodbye, again" to your dad in 30 seconds.
I guess I just chose to look at it like it was 30 more seconds than I was supposed to have.
how did that go?
it was still hard, no matter how much I budgeted my seconds.
the hello-againing was wonderful, and...
the goodbye-againing wasn't.
Oh, Ned, look... You should just go to the cook-off.
you're trying to get rid of me.
no, I'm not trying to get rid of you. I just...
maybe I need an emotional snow day, too.
you need an emotional snow day from me?
is this weird now? Are we weird now because I did "it" with your dad?
no, we're not weird. I've never been so in love with you.
but I'm also feeling a lot of other things.
so many things that I want to tell you and I can't tell you and I'm afraid to tell you and I don't know how to tell you.
you don't have to tell me if you don't want to. I mean...
you do eventually. -- And I will tonight. I promise.
for the meantime, Olive is depending on you.
she said two years ago, she could taste that first-prize blue ribbon, and then that taste was replaced with the bitter tang of defeat.
bitter tang, bitter Olive. It's a story.
and today it's gonna be a happy ending.
come on. Go to the cook-off.
olive will love you for it.
isn't it good to be back again?
just you and me, shoulder-to-shoulder, eye-to-eye.
decorative hats fixed squarely on sweaty brows, bonding in the fiery kiln of competion that forges men's souls.
we're baking pie, Olive.
not just pie -- damn great pie.
this is our year. We're in such a better place than we were two years ago.
I, for one, am no longer encumbered of the tension of a sexual nature toward you.
I'm focused. We should have won last time.
would have won... Had we not gotten screwed by... The buffalo.
sweet lord in heaven, how I hate the buffalo.
when you say "buffalo," do you mean the noble breed of bison lost forever to settlers' greed
or the upstate new york hamlet still thirsting for super bowl glory?
I mean that big phony whipping up those crap muffins over there.
Marianne Marie Beetle. They call her the pastry slayer.
Leo Burns, the new comfort food cook-off coordinator, lover of all things foody.
Oh, and I just love that all foods are welcome at this year's comfort food cook-off.
it's like best in show, only best in belly.
which means buffalo muffin will be locking those horns with colonel Likkin.
he and the buffalo are the teams to beat.
the colonel's been "best in belly" blue-ribbon winner 15 years running.
but there's an empty winner's plate waiting to be loaded.
with damn great pie.
well, you're the pie holers!
I'm a very, very, very big fan. -- Stop.
as event coordinator, I'm not allowed to say this, but I'm rooting for you.
Oh, thank you.
Aw, he's a dreamboat.
well, tugboat, but still. Let's set up, partner.
it's so nice to see that you came back after taking a year off to lick your wounds
and hide in the dank shadows of humiliating defeat. And you were so close.
Yeah, mysterious.
it's as if someone deliberately sabotaged our oven, cheater Mcgee.
it's a poor workman who blames his tools.
just keep your oven mitts to yourself.
I intend to, as I present more award-winning muffins to the judges.
and you remember, now -- losing doesn't make you a loser.
Oh, wait -- it does.
better get stuffing your pieholes.
but despite the freshly stoked heat of the competition...
that buffalo is going down!
the pie maker's thoughts strayed away from pastries to be made and toward Chuck...
wondering what she could possibly be afraid to tell him.
Hi, dad.
the secret Chuck was keeping from the pie maker was born the night before.
Hello, again.
I know I don't look like the Charlotte that you remember, but
Oh, u're the Charlotte I remember, all right.
button-button. Cute as a button.
I miss you, daddy.
isn't this nice? -- Yes.
son of a bitch. Now I'm eating into my "I love you" time.
um, look, I... I love you, and, um...
happy birthday.
Oh, it's -- it's my birthday?
not today, but it was gonna be. -- Then I died.
Yeah. I never got a chance to give it to you, but now I can.
so I guess it kind of is your birthday.
at that very moment, a change of plan occurred to her.
torn between the pie maker she loved and the father she lost, Chuck acted on impulse.
you're gonna put on my glove.
when Ned touches you, you play dead.
the pie maker gave every second he could give...
I'm gonna be back to dig you up in an hour.
and not a second more.
you okay?
it didn't feel like 20 years.
what did it feel like if it didn't feel like 20 years?
gliding.
holding your breath and...
being able to breathe and just...
gliding.
I didn't glide.
what business would you have gliding?
I died.
and then Ned... Ned touched me.
but there was no gliding -- just Ned.
he never touched you again?
no, he can't --no without-- -- good.
how is this even possible?
you, me, here again in the here-and-now when we belong in the hereafter?
since when did death get a loophole?
since Ned. Your dreams, they're gonna be so vid now.
it's so neat. And my bees
you have bees? -- Since you died.
and then they died, and then... Ned touched them, too.
Oh, god, and their honey -- you have never tasted honey like this before.
I hate to look in the gift horse's mouth, but I'm not gonna start craving human flesh, am I?
no, although everything does taste better.
what's the catch, button?
hiding me away like every stray cat, dog, and goose that met your acquaintance.
you don't want Nedly-deadly to know that my bucket's still kicking.
Why? Is there a catch?
not that you're aware of. -- What?
not that I'm aware of. There's a catch.
and I'm gonna catch it before I get caught.
you gonna tell me what that catch is, button?
I will tonight, I promise.
as Chuck's plan was percolating, private investigator Emerson Cod gently extracted the delicate flavors of Bolivia Wara coffee grounds for a smooth, clean coffee experience on a morning.
that would soon prove to be anything but smooth or clean.
emerson, I
I need your help.
friend help or pay help?
see that? That's the kind of body language you never hear with pay help.
Ned brought my dad back to life, but only for a minute, and when the minute was up, we retouched him, as we always do.
no biggie, but yes biggie, because in the heat of the moment, my thinking wasn't so much as "thinking" but "feeling."
and I tricked Ned with my glove, and now my dad's still alive,
and Ned doesn't know, and...
please help me.
what's the part about your gloves, again?
I've used Ned.
now my dad's live because of my impulse-control issues, and...
now somebody else is dead.
first of all, blow.
second... Just relax.
you're not mad at me?
hell yeah, I'm mad! I'm steamed, furious, red-hot!
and don't think I ain't gonna yell at you later!
but for now, we should just put our heads together and try to figure out what to do.
Oh, you're slowing the roll, chief. I'm in the zone.
working awful hard for disappointment over there.
I'm going to win that blue ribbon, wrap it around her neck, and strangle her with it.
olive, you're baking with hate.
rich, buttery, high-in-carbohydrate hate.
you know what no one tells you about cooking with the dark side?
the food is really good.
revenge is a dish best served cold.
we're baking pie -- warm, delicious, happy-making pie.
okay, help cook or get out of the kitchen, short-pants.
fine.
Ah, the sweet smell of victory!
not this year, turd-muffin.
I'll shut your pie holers good.
bring it, stale-cakes! We're gonna win!
who's "we," sucka? I'm gonna win.
my husband, the colonel -- He's dead!
he's not just dead.
he's extra-crispy.
best IN BELLY COMFORT FOOD COOK-OFF
my husband, the colonel -- gone forever.
I'm afraid it looks like he collapsed and fell into his own boiling oil.
I always knew one of his many massive heart attacks would do him in.
at least the colonel left this world fryin'.
should be some comfort.
there's no comfort in knowing that the secret recipe will die along with him.
it was his greatest and only legacy.
surely he wrote it down.
surely he didn't.
my husband was a fat-frying savt.
he kept that recipe stored in his head.
if only I could have him back for one minute to preserve his lasting, loving memory.
I need your help. Help me to, uh, help the widow.
how? Her husband's dead. What are you gonna do?
haul him back to life and say, "colonel, what's your recipe?"
maybe he left something behind.
distract the paramedics long enough for me to, uh...
examine the workstation. -- Ned...
my eyes are -- they're bleeding! Help! I can't see!
I finally know what my birds felt like.
guess I'm dead, eh?
heart attack. Not a lot of time.
and the widow Likkin wants to preserve your secret recipe.
good woman, my bride. Let's do it.
I got all 500 herbs and spices right up here.
better pull up a chair and grab yourself a pen.
that sounds like a long trip down a lazy river we don't have time for.
now, you can't rush goodness.
did you say "heart attack"?
I did. Now, should we start with the herbs or the spices?
Bushwah!
some carpetbagging coward snuck up behind, battered me in my own batter, and shoved me into boiling oil.
that was murder, son.
Really? And you didn't see who did it?
attacked from behind.
they were stealthy, like a snake... Or a yankee.
okay. Uh, let's hit the headlines of the recipe, and with the time left over, we can circle back to the murder.
Oh, this is silly. Are you sure you didn't write it down?
I got one handwritten copy.
I keep it right here in my -- Here in my -- tarnation.
this fat-frying process seems to have robbed me of mobility.
there's nothing in there. -- Impossible.
I've kept my recipe right there -- same spot for 30 years.
what scoundrel stole my secret recipe?
I'll find out, and I'll find out who killed you, too.
but now I'm afraid time is up.
I hate to go, but at least I'm going delicious.
and as the colonel went back to being dead, Chuck faced the consequences of her impulsive decision.
the "bring dad back" part, I don't regret.
I mean, how can anyone regret being reunited with someone.
that they love and they thought they'd never see again?
point taken.
but the big problem -- maybe the biggest problem, in an objective sense
is the dishonesty with Ned.
that and the "making someone else less alive" part.
less alive.
nice euphemism... Killer.
we were at the cemetery in the dead of night.
maybe there was no one else there. Maybe no one else died.
you think this is a "sometimes" rule?
Ned lets somebody live longer than a minute and somebody else has to die sometimes?
No! It's an "every time" rule!
there's some sucker out there dead in the leaves.
Oh, my god. Then maybe some sweet old lady with insomnia who was bringing flowers to her husband's grave...
I mean, it could have been anyone. I could have just killed any innocent.
all right, either way, we got another dead body to find.
a body that was died by Ned, only he doesn't know about it on account of you never told him, which is the wrong I'm correcting.
I know. I know what I did was wrong.
but I was spurred to action in the spur of the moment, which leaves me living in the deep, dark world of consequence.
but if you help me clean this up, then Ned won't have to live anywhere but the bright, happy world of pie, and all we'll have to deal with is each other.
and your daddy. You can't keep that from him.
okay. We'll find the body first.
but I'm telling you, right after that, you go straight to pie boy.
don't be pecking me, woman!
that's the peck of cahoots, which we are definitely not in.
well, thank you anyway.
the cook-off will continue.
the colonel would have wanted it that way.
his tragic heart attack must be honored by us -- his sacred community of fellow chefs.
who now all stand a much better chance of winning.
proceed.
I know it's a tragedy, obviously, but you know what they say when god closes a door, he opens an oven.
they don't say that, and if they do, they don't have much compassion for a dead colonel.
Oh, I am not gonna let you bait me to get all soft and compassion
when we're this close to nailing this competition.
what would you say if I told you I think the colonel was murdered?
boo-hoo. More room at the top.
Oh, my god, you're not kidding.
I think the colonel had a copy of his secret recipe and someone killed him for it.
how could you possibly know that by just looking at his dead body?
I -- I'm an investigator.
working with Emerson Cod has taught me things.
deductive and inductive reasoning, evidence-gathering.
a dead body can say a lot... To the... Trained professional.
anyway, my educated hunch tells me that there's a murder to solve.
you've never solved a murder mystery alone before.
I'm not alone.
me? Oh, I just got all tingly.
a - and not just in the nether regions.
okay, how do we go about this -- this whole p.i. thing?
do we just jam the gun in the suspect's mouth and say "sing, canary."
or I'm gonna decorate this wallpaper with your guts?
neither.
technically, I don't believe you can blow someone's guts out their mouth.
wuss. Holy smokes. Our oven's smoking.
sabotaged! I bet it was the beetle.
I bet it was the colonel's killer.
I know this doesn't take the sting out of the responsibility, but I brought some cash.
with the cash and a note that says "every human body deserves dignity. Please bury this one."
it'll be just like leaving a baby on a doorstep, only...
the tail end of things.
and the point of this would be, say, what? -- Closure.
well, I got a feeling the body we find is gonna give you anything but closure.
and where do you get that idea?
Oh, I didn't just get it. It was given to me by Dwight Dixon.
what was Dwight Dixon doing here?
let me show you something.
a rifle? -- Yep.
looks like sweet old Dwight already had himself a shot lined up.
your weighty conscience might no feel so weighty after you look through here.
why would he have a gun?
that's my father's grave. He was trying to kill us?
not if you killed him first.
why would he want us dead?
as is traditional, the "why" in this case was met with an equal and opposite "because."
upon discovering that the pocket watch he had stolen from Chuck had been stolen back, Dwight set out to reclaim the mysterious timepiece one last time.
following Chuck to the graveyard, Dwight assumed her intent was to return the watch to the grave from which it had been stolen.
ready to pull the trigger and reclaim his prize, Dwight paused, unbelieving the unbelievable sight he saw.
Dwight's mind reeled at the sight of the pie maker.
and Chuck desecrating Charles Charles' grave.
and, as is traditional, he decided to put an end to the thing he did not understand.
but, as all his reeling and unbelieving had taken exactly 61 seconds...
no shot was ever fired.
if I hadn't have kept my dad alive, I'd have been murdered twice.
Yeah, once was enough.
and Ned -- he would be gone, too.
my accidentally killing Dwight lights up three points on our side of the cosmic scoreboard.
Plus, you save that bundle you would have blown on burying Mr. Boom-boom.
better we bury him right here.
I got a couple shovels in the car.
we'll get him under the dirt before the "pay your respects at lunch" crowd shows up.
by the time the grass grows back over this plot, it'll be like none of this ever happened.
and I can't wait till it's like none of this ever happened.
but it did happen.
someone sabotaged our oven. The flame won't shut off.
let it burn -- maybe it'll destroy this building
and all its memories of almost winning with the cleansing power of flame.
olive, we're staying in the contest.
we are?
we need to keep competing as cover so we can investigate colonel Likkin's murder.
winning would make an excellent cover.
whoever killed the colonel is a risk-taker, desperate -- Same as our saboteur.
so find the saboteur, find the killer.
maybe we find our ingredients. They took everything we need to bake pies.
I'm on it. -- Olive?
Vian, what are you doing here? Oh, honey, have you been crying?
I stopped by the pie hole, but it was closed.
and, yes, I was crying.
why is the pie hole closed?
it's man trouble. I can tell.
I knew that Dwight Dixon was heartbreak waiting to pop.
this is Lily's fault.
she aimed a shotgun at his privates and told him to stay away from us.
but half of us is me, and I don't want him away.
I want him close.
give us a minute. -- Vian, it's, uh, good to see you.
come on.
forgive me. I -- I'm so wrapped up in my man, I'm thoughtlessly keeping you from yours.
who? Ned? No.
no, we're partners in a contest -- unromantic partners, like a brother and a sister, like an asexual, androgynous brother and a sister.
my man? No, that's a laugh.
when Dwight didn't show up for our date, I tried to laugh, too, tried to tell myself my feelings for him were silly.
but lying to yourself about love never works.
damn. -- I know.
but still, I keep lying and looking all the same.
if you see Dwight at the pie hole, will you tell him about the "looking" part?
I'd like to see him.
I understand.
boy, do I understand.
I found something.
the saboteur who sabotaged our oven left behind one sticky mistake.
Ooh, what is it? Toxic soot with a dash of DNA?
it's, uh, sweet, woodsy, like a Berkshire forest on a crisp autumn morning.
caramelized sugar. -- Maple syrup.
only one chef here uses pure maple syrup.
the Waffle Nazi. -- The Waffle Nazi.
good.
Chuck had seen dead bodies talk before, but this was different.
this was just her guilty mind giving rise to her guilty feelings.
you're just my guilty mind giving rise to my guilty feelings.
doesn't change the fact that you have royally screwed up.
fine. You talk, I'll shovel.
was it worth it? Sure, fine, I'm a bad man.
you saved three good people by putting me down
a three-for-one sale on the grandest scale.
anytime with those shovels!
what would you have done?
same thing, probably. I'd have killed you, too.
but here's the difference. -- Emerson!
I would have told Ned by now.
shut up!
who you talking to? -- Shut up!
nothing. No one.
I don't need to talk to anyone about anything, cause my conscience is clear.
good. Then grab a shovel.
Ned will never forgive you.
this is an incredible violation of the p.c.f.c.o. rule.
that says no chef is allowed in another chef's kitchen.
it's immediate disqualification.
concentrate on the killer.
that Waffle Nazi is likely our saboteur.
find the saboteur, find the killer.
go, go, go, go.
me? -- Go.
attention, contestants.
this is your 20-minute warning.
any evidence linking Waffle Nazi to colonel Likkin would wrap this case up in brown paper.
and tie it up with a strong, sturdy twine.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Hey, you know what I love about Vivian?
her imagination. She thought you and I were a couple now.
it's crazy. It's like imaging us as hobbits...
or on jet packs...
or hobbits on jet packs.
isn't the idea of us romantically entwined a panic, a scream, a four-hour heart attack of complete impossibility?
it all makes sense.
it does?
this batter's better than batter.
it's the evidence we need to wrap up this case. -- Hurray.
what is it?
Mm delicious!
savory, not sweet.
bursting with what's got to be like...
500 herbs and spices.
it's the colonel's secret recipe.
and the killer on a plate.
sir, I accuse you of -- -- sabotage!
you have sabotaged mein irons!
W - we didn't do that.
don't cry.
look -- it's justice o'clock. I'm telling.
well, pie holers.
it looks as if you are soon to be eliminated from the competition.
we're kicking you before you baked yourself out.
when Leo Burns tootles up on his scooter and sees how many rules you have broken, your dreams of comfort-food glory are kaput.
you saw our oven. We were sabotaged, too.
liars roast in hell.
just sayin'.
we're not the saboteurs.
mein waffle cord leaped into your arms like a puppy wanting love and then cut itself in two.
when we present the evidence we got, you can kiss the cook-off.
it's "goodbye" in German.
I do not speak a word of German.
I speak English mit a German accent.
pageantry.
we found this batch of the colonel's secret recipe in your kitchen.
that's a big bowl of motive, fritz.
are you suggesting murder?
ridiculous.
Herr Likkin and I were soon to become business partners.
chicken and waffles?
what in the name of julia child are you people doing?
I can't count the number of rules violations going on. I'm so disappointed.
there may be the appearance of rules being bent or broken completely, but there's a bigger picture you need to see.
I just haven't finished painting it yet.
Yeah, we're not the saboteurs.
poppycock. The pie hole is disqualified.
all right, that ought to do it. Let's get out of here.
no, wait. We need a priest or a rabbi or somebody to say something.
what?
Dwight might not have been the nicest man, but everybody deserves a burial with dignity.
fine. I got buttloads of dignity to sprinkle on the ground.
come on. Get holy. -- Thank you.
here lies Dwight. Here lies his gun. He was bad. Now he's done. Let's go.
all this and I still have to deal with my mother?
don't you mean "father"?
delighted.
can the crap and sell it to the tourists.
what are you doing here, Cod?
what in the hell are you doing here?
waiting for Dwight Dixon.
well, uh, he may, uh, disappoint.
men do that.
what's with the shotgun?
military salute. -- For Dwight Dixon?
for Charles.
but if I happen to miss and blow Dwight's head off, purely by accident.
well, that's something my lawyers can pretty much sort out later.
well, uh, so lovely catching up.
well, that's everything.
but there's no trunk big enough to carry home my busted dreams of blue-ribbon victory.
back to the pie hole.
which is empty, which is strange, because Chuck should be there.
the colonel's chicken booth.
an empty nest chock-full of clues.
a really bold detective team would sneak over for one last bit of recon before packing up their pots and pans for good.
remember, bakers' hats and hairnets must be worn at all times.
memorize the scene -- every detail
the prints in the batter, the footprints, the gurney tracks.
what's that?
Oh, sprinkles. I love sprinkles.
you love clues.
two great tastes that taste great together.
painted plastic -- cheap jewelry.
left here before the colonel was killed.
which means they belong to the killer.
attention, contestants, this is your 10-minute warning.
the most important thing is to keep our wits about us and our nerves steady.
there's no good in freaking out, so don't go crazy and start -- I don't know
kissing me or something ridiculous like that.
just because we're locked in a trunk, we could die at any minute...
what are you...
clean thoughts, chum.
don't make me whip up another batch of beat-down.
look -- cheap plastic earrings.
you're the killer!
you're the killer.
you deep-fat-fried the colonel.
suppose you were gonna bake me in my own oven.
nobody's baking anybody.
if you weren't here to kill the colonel, where you doing here right before he got killed?
I thought the colonel died of a heart attack.
I only snuck in here to try to...
you're the saboteur. -- But not the killer.
sabotage is a disqualifying offense.
in the good lord's good name, have mercy.
I need that blue-ribbon prize if muffin buffalo is to roam again.
you see before you a desperate woman, not a killer.
you can't be in here. Disqualified.
pie holers, you can't be in here at all -- banned for life.
which reminds me -- I forgot to report your disqualification to the judges -- Which I'm going to do right now. -- You're the killer.
me? Look at me?
I ride a scooter. What kind of killer could I possibly be?
the kind that leaves tracks.
those are gurney tracks from where the paramedics wheeled away colonel Likkin.
those flattened treads that go from the batter back to the deep fryer are killer tracks
yours.
those are hot-oil burns on your hands.
did the colonel spatter when you deep-fat-fried him, you sick son of a bitch?
you have no proof.
that story will never hold up in court.
this will.
Oh, the colonel's secret recipe.
you're busted, tubby.
the facts were these
one year ago, Leo Burns was a slender and happy but slightly lonely man.
one day, he chose to drown his sorrows in a bucket of colonel Likkin's southern-fried chicken...
which led to another... And another.
and soon, the colonel's unique blend of 500 herbs and spices were all Leo could eat.
diabetes, obesity, and night blindness were all quick to follow the coated volumes of wings, breasts, and thighs Leo ate.
having lost himself to Likkin, Leo vowed to destroy the colonel andhis precious recipe.
Leo volunteered as this year's comfort-food coordinator, waiting for the colonel to make his annual appearance, which would become his final appearance.
but Leo could not bring himself to destroy the secret recipe that robbed him of his life.
and that was his undoing.
attention, cook-off contestants.
all entries must be on the judges' table in 30 seconds
30 seconds.
Leo never reported our disqualification.
what can we do in 30 seconds? We have nothing, and our oven is broken.
Revengeisa dish best served cold.
which is why I brought one of your killer icebox lemon pies, stored it in our fridge, and called it "plan b."
don't mean squat if it isn't on the judges' table in...
20 seconds -- 20 seconds.
the colonel would be so proud.
now that I have the recipe, that nice doughnut man and I are gonna go into business together.
finger Likkin doughnut holes.
sounds delicious... And filthy.
america's favorite -- You'll make a fortune.
the blue-ribbon first prize in this year's annual comfort food cook-off goes to...
the pie hole!
close your eyes give me your hand, darling do you feel my heart beating?
do you understand?
do you feel the same?
or am I only dreaming?
or is this burning an eternal flame?
say my name...
it's Chuck. -- It's... Olive.
no, it's Chuck. I don't know where she is.
she said she'd be at the pie hole all day, and if she was there all day, She would have answered her phone.
maybe she's stepping out -- stepped out.
I don't know where she is. Vian doesn't know where Dwight is.
what if Dwight leaving Chuck's obituary was more than an insurance policy?
do you mind if I go look for her?
no, I don't mind.
sorry to leave you with the mess.
I'm used to the mess.
sun shines through the rain a whole life, so lonely and then you come and ease the pain, I don't want to lose this feeling, say my name...
congratulations, partner.
congratulations to you, too, partner.
do you feel my heart beating?
do you understand?
do you feel the same?
or am I only dreaming?
or is this burning an eternal...
Fla-a-me?
Hello, Vivian, Lily.
I was in the neighborhood
passing by, really, when I wondered if you might like some pie...
which I forgot to bring.
but while I'm here, I was also wondering if you knew where I might find Dwight Dixon.
ninth circle of hell, if there's any justice.
Lily, stop.
we don't know where Dwight is.
and how could you forget a thing like pie? I find that curious.
it comes in a box, you know.
say, you got a squatter in your old digs over there?
I'll find out.
the pie maker braced himself to find Chuck held hostage by the deadly, desperate Dwight Dixon.
I was worried. I thought -- -- charlotte.
it's okay, dad.
"dad"?
I was gonna tell you.
at this moment, a father and daughter were on a camel trip across the Rub' al-Khali, the 600-mile-long body of sand in the vast, harsh wilderness known as the Arabian desert.
in truth, young Chuck should have been floating on a sea of dreams, but at 8 years, 8 months, 21 days old, she was kept awake by the varicella-zoster virus, also known as chickenpox.
her father, Charles, hoped this magical journey was the antidote to his daughter's discomfort.
indeed, it eased the girl's itch and replaced it with a burning desire for adventure, adventures her father promised to take her on someday.
sadly, someday's adventures would never come, for, in a month, Charles would die, and young Chuck would learn the sad lesson that, try as one might, one can never recapture what once was.
until Charlotte Charles would again have her father.
hello.
only having him back meant lying to the pie maker she loved.
when Ned touches you, you play dead.
say, you got a squatterin your old digs over there?
I was worried. I thought -- - Charlotte.
it's okay, dad.
dad?
you kept your father alive.
this looks bad.
it is bad. It's horribly bad.
it can't be that bad.
not like I'm the first ghost he's ever seen.
please say something.
he's up here. - Lily?
quick! - No! Get out!
Lily, Vivian, is that you?
you know good and well who we are!
damn it!
and we are spittin' pissed at being served up a steaming plate of door!
I don't get pissed.
a Gypsy once told me it brings on hemorrhoids.
why can't I just go out there and talk to her?
No!
after you were gone, Lily and Vivian moved into our old house to look after me.
they can't know that we're alive again.
but they're your aunts, button-button.
except for the one that's my mother.
so you know.
and you're okay? Yeah?
can we get back to your rude reception?
sorry. I thought you were home invaders.
then why did you say my name? - I didn't.
I heard it. - It must have been your bad eye -- ears.
when you came over here to check for squatters and didn't immediately resurface, Lily assumed the worst.
and brought two barrels of backup.
Hey, no squatters. No anyone. Let's all go home.
what was that? - That was me.
No!
get it away!
it's all right.
Lily's been petrified of clowns ever since our grandpapa chased her around the house with one of those.
it was Charlotte Charles whose strategic placement of the toy prevented her strong-willed mother from strong-arming her way further into the closet.
we need to talk.
you don't want to hear what I have to say.
a low-pressure system moving in from the coast threatened Papen County with its first winter storm.
but for the pie maker and Chuck, it was as if the tempest had already hit.
if I were thinking clearer, I'd...give you space to process everything, but I haven't slept since all this happened.
since... I made it happen.
if your dad's alive, someone else had to die.
who was it? - Dwight Dixon.
we found him with a sniper rifle in the cemetery. - What?
emerson thinks that he was planning on killing both you and me the night we re-alived my dad.
emerson knows?
he helped me bury Dwight in my dad's empty grave.
he wanted me to tell you right away, but I-I begged him, "please, just wait until I know what to say." And then... you...you found me first.
what would have happened if I didn't?
I'd have brought you up here and told you that I was reckless and selfish.
Yes, you were.
and I can say that I'm sorry for deceiving you, and I will say that forever, but I can't say that I'm sorry my dad's alive, because I'm not.
it is so overwhelming, and I am so grateful, I don't know how to explain it.
you acted on an impulse so poignant and deep.
I know what it feels like. I felt it with you.
and I'll never be sorry I did it, either.
I'll let you breathe in a minute. I promise.
I'm good.
so, what's next?
the reality is, your dad's back -- in swaddling bandages, but he's back.
and if we're gonna be one big, happy, albeit unconventional... family...then there are a lot of things we need to discuss.
well, I've already covered a lot of ground
first touch, life, second touch, death, and that Digby and I are the only other alive-agains to be alive longer than a minute.
then that leaves figuring out what to do with your dad.
the only way we can do that is together.
are we together?
we're so "gethered," electrons couldn't get between us.
you're beaming.
I'm not the only one.
what is that?
the body of Nora Mcquoddy was what that was.
mere moments earlier, the meticulous Papen harbor lighthouse keeper, obsessing over a stubborn smudge, would make a fatal mistake, because what Nora didn't notice was her killer...
who wanted everyone to notice her.
county coroner's office.
at this time, the prime suspect, seen fleeing from the scene in a yellow fisherman's jacket, has been identified as the lighthouse keeper's husband, Merle Mcquoddy.
that's some shady shadow puppet.
out of all the enigmatic, esoteric local ghost stories, his is my absolute fave.
Merle Mcquoddy was a salty sailor who left his lighthouse-keeper wife and young child on a fishing voyage 10 years ago, only to vanish...
without a trace. Bom bom ba-bom
mariners swear his ghost haunts the sea caves by the harbor.
and when the lighthouse shines, you can hear his ghoulish moans as he cries out for someone, anyone -- to guide him home and -- boo!
booed ya!
in actual fact, the facts were these Merle Mcquoddy did, indeed, leave his wife and child a voyage 10 years ago.
his boat, the "Knockout Nora," waedload down with dungeness, when it was knocked out by the category 5 typhoon "Tyrone."
for 9 years, 11 months, and 5 days, the presumed ghost, Merle Mcquoddy, was very much alive and alone on a deserted island.
all the while, Nora kept watch, praying that one day her husband would come home and life would return to the way it once was.
after a near decade of waiting, her prayers were answered when Merle was rescued by a gay family cruise ship.
but Merle Mcquoddy was not the man he used to be.
he'd roam the beaches at midnight, flew into rages, shunned indoor plumbing!
and now he's a murderer at large, and...
Mr. Cod? I was told I could find you here.
my name is Elliot Mcquoddy.
son of urban legend Merle Mcquoddy.
please, you have to clear my father of my mother's murder.
my entire life savings everything I ever found combing the shore with my metal detector.
by all means, bring me up to tempo on what happened tonight.
mom dropped me off at the movies with a batch of homemade peanut brittle afterwards, when I didn't see the minivan, I walked home.
cops were everywhere.
they told me she was dead.
and dad was nowhere to be found.
you want it a la mode?
the power's out, and the ice cream won't be so much ice as cream soon.
lots and lots, please.
who knows when I'll get another meal, without mom to make it?
Oh, you poor boy.
there, there.
not here, here.
sorry, kid, eyewitnesses say they saw Merle Mcquoddy running away from the scene.
all they saw was a yellow raincoat.
there's no way he'd hurt my mother.
after 10 years of waiting, our family was finally reunited.
I don't know where my dad is, and even if I find him...they'll take him away.
excuse me.
well, hate to be a bitch, but ain't no way in the world I'm taking this case.
you think Merle Mcquoddy murdered Nora.
Merle Mcquoddy's ship returned minus a few oars, making it a very easy leap from captain to killer.
nothing this kid had to say makes me think otherwise.
Plus, I don't work in the rain.
clearly, you don't hate being a bitch that much.
I'll kick you back my third of the cut.
and if you're doing my third of the work, then, um, I'm gonna take a personal day to deal with personal...
persons.
well...
look like papa's gonna need a new raincoat.
and leather conditioner.
you see this water damage? These wing tips were custom-cobbled.
can we hurry? I'm supposed to see chuck's father. I want to get him a...welcome back to life gift.
Oh, I got the perfect gift -- tap dad back to the grave.
why would you say that?
because you are in over your he.
you can put a leash on a dog. You know why? 'Cause it's a dog.
but you can't put one on a war veteran that was cut down in his prime.
before long, he's gonna break free.
then he'll just be running the streets, telling the world what you can do.
tap that.
this is Chuck's chance at having a family again. I can't...tap that.
so make it look like an accident.
trip over an ottoman and dick van dyke that ass.
fine. I said my piece.
let's get face-to-face with lighthouse lady.
what happened to her face? - She's been effaced!
Mrs. Mcquoddy?
present conditions are cold, rainy, with a 100% chance of you're dead.
we're hoping that you can tell us who killed you.
Oh, hell. We got a melty mouth.
"yes" or "no" questions. - She can't nod. How can she nod?
what is that tapping?
I don't think she's tapping. I think she's talking -- in Morse code.
how do you know Morse code?
Charles taught it to Chuck and me when we were kids so we could communicate fr our bedroom windows with flashlights.
Mrs. Mcquoddy? Who committed your murder?
is that all? Time's up.
Pic-hiss.
Pic-hiss! Peaches!
it's an acronym, fool.
Papen County historical society.
an old lighthouse like Nora's is bound to have interest.
peaches.
olive? What are you doing here?
looking and finding you two, which is a cinch, natch, 'cause I'm such an ace junior P. I. in training.
look what mama got papa.
I bought one for you, too, Ned.
and one for me, too, of course.
cause together, we're a crime-fighting team.
what do you say, papa?
uh, I think you and papa are gonna have a grand old time while I, uh...take care of a... thing.
but... - Mood-swing sally, anchors aweigh!
daddy, you sure you don't want some pie?
Thanks, button, but I'll have cake.
since when do you eat pie? You hate pie.
well, this is the one that won me over.
so, no cake? At all? Oh, well.
well, let's not worry about pie.
uh, this family has bigger things to discuss.
to that end...
move Mr. Charles from Ned's childhood home to Ned's apartment.
you killed a tree for this?
I'm happy as a clam right here.
the problem is, Lily and Vivian are right here, too, and for a couple of agoraphobes, they get around.
we can't risk them coming back and discovering you, thereby discovering the truth about all of us.
from there, it's a hopopop, skip, and a jump to angry mobs with pitchforks and torches.
if I bunk with you, you'd kill me again just by passing the pepper.
there are many safeguards already in place.
truth be told, you touching me dead doesn't scare me nearly as much as the thought of you doing that to my daughter.
sir, I could never hurt Chuck.
Oh, sure you could, deadly Nedly.
you could forget she's walking behind you and stop to tie your shoe or trip over a forgotten newspaper.
no number of redundant precautions can assure that you won't inadvertently kill her for good and forever, unless you're not in the same vicinity, which is why we're gonna make a deal.
I go quietly and play by your rules...
and you never see Charlotte again.
the first family of Papen County.
bunch of blond-over-blue children of the corn.
which one we gonna grill first?
Gus -- the arose my kennedy of the clan.
while brothers one through four run the family's commercial-real-estate empire and South Asian call centers, all he got was the historical society.
Mr. Papen. Welcome to the pie hole.
uh, did you get my application to declare our wonderful establishment a historical monument?
that application was denied the moment you people destroyed an exemplary specimen of turn-of-the-century beaux arts architecture with the addition of a stucco-crust overhang.
told you.
well, uh, since you're already here, you mind answering a few questions about Nora Mcquoddy?
have they found the bloodthirsty husband?
Merle? No.
what is Nora's connection to the P.C.H.S?
with her husband lost at sea, Nora couldn't afford the lighthouse upkeep.
I used my family influence to declare it a protected historic monument.
I appointed Nora the lighthouse steward and the mcquoddys its guardian until the family line dies out or the sun swallows the earth in a solar flare, killing us all.
well, that means Elliot's in charge of the lighthouse now.
other than that, I didn't really know Nora.
if you want to learn more, talk to Annabelle Vandersloop.
they volunteered together in the diorama exhibit.
such a depressing word, diorama.
it has "die" in it.
I like "rama."
okay, so, this..is so we can keep in constant contact in the present, and this is so you can regain contact with your past..
well, I'll be. Thank you, button.
right. Well, uh... I'll leave you to settle in.
digby, come on.
there's milk to go with the cake.
you didn't have to go to all that trouble.
I wanted to. It's a huge adjustment.
that's big of you, kid.
we won't get anywhere without a little teamwork.
that's a perfect segue to our playbook.
uh, this is everything that pertains to the alive-again lifestyle with your particular alive-again situation.
you mean my corpse face?
corpse face... taken into consideration.
in short, stay inside with the doors locked and the curtains drawn.
food deliveries are verboten.
however, telephone use is unrestricted, as long as you choose from the list of cleared aliases on page 13 when communicating with the outside world.
for the first month, I would recommend wearing latex gloves.
I already got gloves on.
no harm in double-bagging it, eh?
sir, I'm really trying here.
instead of buttering me up...
why don't we deal with the elephant in the room?
you killed me.
I knew your parents, Ned. You were raised right. How about an apology?
I'm sorry.
"all is forgiven" is gonna be a long time coming.
you need to respect that. All right?
now, if you'll excuse me, I got a bunch of reading to do.
while Charles was reading, Olive Snook and the private investigator were listening to one Annabelle Vandersloop.
Nora and I were best friends.
we met through the notable dows of Papen County.
we paid tribute to our notable husbands notable deaths through the miniature medium of diorama.
I love dioramas. How can I get involved?
are you a widow? - No.
unfortunately, I'm single.
but I do have a beloved horse who bought the farm.
I could dioram that.
sorry. Expired spouses only.
for example, my late husband, munitions manufacturer Adolph Vandersloop, went out with a bang.
an errant 4th of july rocket flew into an open window while he was taking inventory, one can never add enough glitter to a husband's memory.
miss Snook, do you see how your pony death might make a mockery of our legitimate efforts?
do you see how you have cotton balls stuck to your ass?
I was looking for those!
Yeah, well, I'm looking for somethg -- information...on whether Nora Mcquoddy's husband made himself a notable widower.
I was with sweet Nora when she heard the news that homosexual boat had rescued Merle.
can you imagine the joy of starting over with a husband you thought you'd lost?
no. You can't.
well, anyway, Nora was the first to admit that she was an overprotective mother, but with Merle home and Elliot so desperate to bond with him, it quickly became two against one.
she just finally had to put her foot down.
on what?
Oh, crazy things, like, you know, father/son sailing trips around the world.
she absolutely forbade it.
and I guess that was the final straw before Merle snapped, killed her, and went awol.
Oh, sometimes I just think to myself, "life -- you can't make this crap up."
Yeah, well, um, thanks for your time.
thank you. - Thank you.
well, good luck.
speaking of crap, Elliot seems to be full of it.
we met a heartbroken mama's boy who never mentioned feuds with mama.
what gives?
that's just what we're gonna ask him.
don't bother signing in.
the open house is off.
who are you?
Willie Gherkin -- smiley realty.
you lost your smile, pickle.
I thought it was too good to be true.
this lighthouse lands in my lap, and now I find out i can't sell it because it's a protected historical monument!
this is so not the way the secret is supposed to work.
Where's the owner? - Elliot? That little bowl-cut split.
but not before I advanced him 10 grand against the sale.
said he and his father were going out of town and needed cash quick.
is that legal?
how should I know? I just got my license.
Ah, screw it.
I'm going back to personal training -- where there's respect.
excuse me.
Hey, try this on for size.
so, Merle kills Nora, and then Elliot hires me to take the suspicion off Merle.
and then Elliot goes and gets the funds so they can take their little father-and-son trip.
but if they did score a sloop, there's no way they're taking it out in this weather.
they must be hiding. Let's smoke 'em out.
I can't believe you got me working in this downpour.
Yeah, what's up with that, anyway, rain-hater?
I mean, I'd get it if you were a cat or had hair.
or got dumped.
back in the rainy day, my ex and I used to hole up with a bottle of brandy and some tomato soup, and we wouldn't come out until the sun did.
now...
whenever the drops fall, it reminds me of everything I lost and ain't gonna get back. Happy?
let's wait it out here a bit.
I've always wanted to see this place.
but you can't get much of a feel for it when you're trying to peek inside.
are you trying to give me the heebie-jeebies or something?
or a theory as to where the murderous Mcquoddys are holed up.
remember the sea caves Merle's ghost supposedly haunted with his howls?
there's nothing haunted about them.
the sound is created when the wind rushes in off the water, kind of like...
Elliot knows those caves like the back of his hand!
if he's in there, he's gonna get the back of mine.
boo-yah! Let's go.
all right, sugar have been re-sugared, creamers have been re-creamed.
is there anything else you want me to do before I head to the store?
dad gave me a list.
um, slippers, mouthwash, and "the last 20 years of my life back."
he's... so funny. - Hilarious.
it's bad enough we can't touch. Now I'm not allowed to see you? How is that possible?
we don't have to stop seeing each other. It's just when dad's around...
which is limited to your apartment.
he can't go anywhere else.
I'm not embarrassed to say that I'm scared of your father
petrified, actually -- and -- stop smiling.
I can't help it. Something's happening I never thought would happen.
my dad's torturing my first boyfriend.
Yay.
exactly. We get to be the teenagers we never thought we'd get to be.
you because you were locked up in some boarding school and me because I was shut up with my shut-in aunts.
and now you get to be the studly varsity quarterback, and I get to be the flirty head cheerleader.
which means we can break curfews and mislead our parents and...
generally... sneak around.
I may need some more convincing.
I'll meet you later behind the bleachers.
bring your pom-poms.
Hello, Nedly.
looked to me like you were necking with my daughter
the daughter you promised to keep a distance from.
you can't be here. Please go back upstairs.
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.
everybody out!
we have a gas leak caused by, uh...
a radon emission chock full of asbestos!
uh, safety first! Cover your eyes! Everybody out!
seriously -- no cake at all?
I made you a cake.
I'm not one for chocolate.
who's not for chocolate? Everyone at least tolerates it!
Mr. Charles, you can't be in public like this.
if someone sees you...
I'll say I'm a burn victim...if I need to say anything at all.
I've been walking around for an hour, and no one's looked at me twice.
I wonder if I can get myself one of those "handicapped parking" placards.
there's no driving! That's rule number 17!
why am I supposed to play by the rules when you don't, Romeo?
I -- I'm just trying to keep you safe.
look, kiddo, you may be able to scare Charlotte with stories of mobs and pitchforks and torches, but I know the truth.
if the villagers show, they aren't coming for me.
no, they're coming for the guy with the magic finger.
hate to break it to you, Charles, but no one cared about dr. Frankenstein.
they were after his monster.
and regardless of what you think, my priority is your daughter's well-being.
if you walk out that door, you put her life in jeopardy.
as her father, I'll be the judge of that.
you're not leaving.
not bad for a dead guy, huh?
Don't...touch... me.
as the tide turned for the pie maker, a turn of the tide allowed Emerson Cod and Olive Snook to turn their investigation toward a sea cave.
if the Mcquoddys are barnacled up in here, we'll have them cornered.
if Mcquoddy is here, I'll just die!
not because he's a killer, but because he's a...
easy there, friend!
not foe.
Yeah, well, we are foes, for sure.
emerson Cod, P.I. here to trawl your ass downtown.
Where's Elliot?
gathering supplies.
we know all about the Mcquoddy family killers cruise.
you two murdered Nora!
you're mistaken, matey!
when she died, I was here.
why are you bunked up al grotto?
for the past month, Nora and I had been trying to put our marriage back on its old course, but 10 years apart leaves you different people.
the other night, while Elliot was at the movies, Nora confessed to me that she'd found her bearings with another man.
bewildered, I sought shelter here.
why not just clear things up with the authorities?
because I'm a ghost with an alibi as thin as fishing line!
it was Elliot's idea to set sail from here.
said he'd garner the funds, and I would prep the vessel.
just one hole in your story.
Elliot never mentioned Nora's new squeeze.
Nora never told him.
Yeah, well, you better cough up a name, or we're hauling your buoy in.
she didn't tell me his name.
but I found this...in her personal effects.
a dutch love spoon.
men used to give it to their women as a symbol of the sweetness that they'd feed each other forever.
I've read the entire harlequin library.
I didn't give my wife this spoon.
no. A lover did.
a lover who murdered her in a jealous rage before she had a chance to tell him that she was leaving her husband.
see? Engraving says "A.P. Hearts N.M."
n.m. is Nora Mcquoddy, but who in the hell is A.P. ?
Papen is a dutch name. Scurvy!
there's 50 Papens in this county alone.
but only one Augustus.
I think I was first.
what happened?
uh, your dad came down, and we had a little... tussle.
what do you mean "a tussle"?
well, more like a scuffle.
Oh, my god. - Wait. Let me explain.
Oh, my god. Ned, oh, my god. Come here.
the light... so bright.
are you okay? - My wrist.
what? - I think I need to ice it.
you go upstairs, and I'll be right there. - Okay.
that was an act! - An act of foolishness.
why would you bring him to the pie hole?
I didn't. He left my apartment of his own accord, wandered around for an hour, and then grabbed a seat at the counter.
no, he wouldn't do that. He knows the rules.
didn't you hear? Your dad's not one for chocolate or rules.
so from this point on, he's gonna be doing his own thing.
all right, I will go upstairs, and I will talk to him.
we said we'd handle this together. I'm coming with you.
no. You're far too upset. I'm not having you fighting again.
he's a big boy. He can handle it.
Yeah, well, maybe I can't.
Chuck? - I get it.
my dad is strong-willed, and he's stubborn.
but it's just a normal father/daughter/ daughter's boyfriend dynamic.
no, it's not. - Why not?
because he's been dead for 20 years? Just...
pretend he's been in a coma.
I don't have the luxury of pretending that he's in a coma or you're the head cheerleader or any of this is normal, because Charles has no problem exposing o secret to the rest of the world!
we need to put a stop to this. - How? 'Cause re-deading him is not an option.
I never said that. Look, I've tried everything to make this work.
you don't want to work together anymore -- fine.
you take care of it.
come here, button.
what I have here is a cookbook of culinary treasures from around the world.
close your eyes, tap the page, and where the spoon lands is where you and I are gonna go tonight.
no, dad, it was just a misunderstanding that went out of control.
leaving is not the answer.
well, is this better? Let's see.
Uh,rule 21 -- when crossing rooms simultaneously, party A shall announce,'coming,'
at which point party B shall pause, then commence movement with the response,'going.'
this is how you live?
Charlotte, you may have grown up without me, but I am back, and I am never gonna stop trying to keep you safe.
the little girl I left behind would have never settled for a lock-and-key existence.
no, she was destined for adventure.
but... my life is here.
this isn't a life. This is a freak show.
we're only freaks in Ned's world.
away from Ned, we could do anything, be anything.
dad, I just want things to be how they used to be.
come with me, button.
pie is... simple. It's limited. Just a bit of...pastry and filling.
cake is complex, layered with treasures waiting to be discovered.
which one do you choose?
Gus and Nora were an item?
could he have had something to do with her murder?
you didn't hear it from me.
Oh, my god!
miss Snook, I almost forgot -- I told the notable widows your story, and it made us realize how very blessed we are.
this better to have loved and lost than to be you.
well, you'll have to excuse me.
I have an appointment to get to.
ta, sad miss Snook.
see you at Tuesday's potluck.
not on the savile row glen plaid cashmere.
see you at the potluck on Tuesday!
ta.
you get anything from Vandersloop?
just a good riling.
cause I found something, snooping around in Gus Papen's office.
a proposal to redevelop Papen Harbor lighthouse.
check the next page.
a waterslide! - He got a green light.
the runt of the Papen litter found a way to prove that he can go toe-to-capitalistic-toe with all his brothers.
Merle's sudden return gave him a Mcquoddy twofer
kill Nora and then frame the crazy captain with the crime.
with both of them out of the way, he's free to redevelop to his bank account's content, - provided he could get rid of -- Elliot Mcquoddy!
confirming a meeting with gus at the lighthouse tonight.
help! No!
Oh, hell no! - Oh, hell no!
all right, Papen! Step away from the boy!
if I do, he'll die!
is that reverse psychology? That's exactly what you want!
what I want is to save him!
is that reverse reverse psychology?
he didn't do this!
well, then who the hell did?
who the hell did? Was Elliot Mcquoddy himself.
realizing the severity of the impending nor'easter, Nora's son struggled to do his dead mother proud by raising the signal flags...
mommy!
and failed.
thank you.
it's okay, Elliot.
so, wait a minute.
you weren't trying to wipe out the Mcquoddy line and take over this lighthouse?
of course not! Not when I want to save it!
I don't like the looks of this.
I don't like the looks of him!
welcome to the Papen lighthouse resort & day spa"?
shut the a cappella up.
and that's how our cocktail hour begins
with a bang and a song!
followed by a gourmet meal and dancing here in the lamp room.
that's why I called Elliot -- to pitch him!
this feels really, really wrong.
how can a symbol of love be wrong?
so, you... and my mom?
she wanted to tell you.
then your father returned.
we tried to put our feelings aside, to give them a shot at recapturing the past...
but they couldn't.
let's have something good come out of this tragedy.
Oh, if that's the plan, please nix the glitter.
who'd you get to decorate the place -- Annabelle Vandersloop?
wait a minute. What if crazy craft lady was up here, but instead of a hot-glue gun, she brought a stone-cold harpoon?
Mrs. Vandersloop was my mother's best friend. Why would she kill her?
because Nora wasn't the only squeeze Papen here was squeezin'.
turn around there, shortstop.
you were getting down with the diorama dame.
I damned that dame every time she made an advance
like tonight, in my office, and a dozen nights before.
come on, Papen.
you two must have been swapping something other than historical factoids.
once... years ago...
at the historical society christmas party.
so, spurned lover spears her best friend, then frames ghost husband to take the fall.
let's rubber-cement her ass to a prison bed.
Oh, tell me you guys are missing a baritone.
a full house!
so much for keeping the innocent-victim count down.
seriously, does she toot glitter?
Oh, that ain't glitter. That's gunpowder.
SHS going to blow us up.
you remember my husband, Adolph, the munitions manufacturer?
I inherited the remaining inventory.
said I'd save it for a rainy day.
and look -- it's here!
Annabelle, why?
you tossed our love aside like it never happened!
it was one night!
what we had was so much more special than anything you had with Nora.
when merle returned, it was the answer to my prayers.
but even then, you couldn't let go!
so I had to eliminate her.
I still love Nora. - Shut up.
that's why you've left me no choice.
I don't understand how killing us is gonna solve anything!
I do! I do!
um, when you called me "sad miss Snook,"
Oh, it really honked me off, but now I realize that you recognized sadness in me because you had it in you.
uh, the rest of you don't know what it's like to know in your heart that you belong with somebody, if you could only eliminate everybody else so that maybe he'd finally, finally grasp what you've been trying to show him
that feeling that you've been dying to recapture.
if only for a moment.
but that moment never comes, so what do you do? Decide not to love Ned?
see? I've tried that. - Me too!
did it work? - Heck no.
heck no! So you know what I say?
Annabelle Vandersloop did move on.
she was no longer sad about losing Gus's love, since a 30-year prison sentence gave her something to be truly sad about.
Merle and Elliot Mcquoddy moved on, as well, becoming partners in Gus Papen's lighthouse hotel.
they used the profits for a trip around the world and found, on the high seas, the route back to their father/son bond.
meanwhile, private detective Emerson Cod was afloat in a sea of reward money, given by the Papen County Historical Society, which he shared with the junior P. I. in training.
nice work, Snook. - Thanks, Cod.
I learned from the best. - Wait. Hold on, now. We ain't done.
you remember when you said you were still in love with Ned?
that wasn't just for wicked widow's benefit, was it?
no. Oh, Emerson, I thought I'd stomped out that flame, or at least brought it down to a smolder, but no.
I still burn and yearn for him now more than ever.
do I need to be concerned that any of my pie hole peeps are gonna be eliminate meaning, am I gonna harpoon Chuck so Ned will finally love me?
no. - Well...
if the day finally comes that being around pie boy and his pie girl make your suffering insufferable,
I just want you to know that, uh, there's a place for you, right here in this professional establishment.
all you have to do is ask.
I think I may be winning you over.
Itty-bitty...
you made me love a rainy day again.
you've got to understand.
when I was a little girl,
I used to compare my dad to all the other dads on our street.
I probably wasn't very objective, because I was convinced that he was the strongest and bravest and most fun man in the neighborhood.
I can say, objectively, he was all those things.
and when he was gone, that's how I remembered him.
I put him on a pernal pedestal.
and now...
now he wants me to leave.
leave? Where?
anywhere the spoon lands.
he promised me an adventure like the ones he told me about when I was a kid.
all I have to do is...
choose cake over pie.
he's trying to be the dad that I always dreamed of, someone who could keep his little girl safe and happy.
except I'm...
I'm not a little girl.
which is why I told him the spoon lands here.
I already feel safe and happy, and...
and, besides, we have adventures every day.
what did he think of your decision?
he's waiting for you upstairs. - With a gun?
with an apology.
he wants us all to start fresh.
then he's a good dad.
and you're a good man.
come on.
dad? Come on! Grab your hat!
we're taking hot toddies up to the roof to watch the snow!
I chose, too.
dad! Dad!
there comes a time for every vampire...
...when the idea of eternity becomes momentarily unbearable.
living and feeding in the shadows with only your own company...
...rots into a solitary, hollow existence.
immortality seems like a good idea...
...until you realize you're going to spend it alone.
so I slept, hoping the sounds of the passing eras would fade out...
...and a sort of death might happen.
but as I lay there, the world didn't sound like the place I had left...
...but something different.
better...
it became worthwhile to rise again as new gods were born and worshiped.
night and day, they were never alone.
I would become one of them.
whether it was the meal or the 100 years of rest, I'm not sure.
but suddenly I was feeling better than ever.
my senses so high...
...they led me straight to the instrument of my resurrection...
...playing in my old house.
Jesus.
your voice...
who the hell are you?
the question provoked an irresistible urge.
I am the vampire Lestat.
it just rolled out of my mouth.
with one sentence, I betrayed everything about my kind.
betrayed our code of secrecy.
vampire?
that's funny. -Indeed.
hilarious.
you're all...
...so beautiful.
your hands are-- -Cold as death?
you're gonna kill us? -No.
all that you've ever dreamed of, I'm going to make yours.
this is your lucky day.
it was a bold move, I admit.
but from that moment on they were my friends, my children, my band.
giving the world a new god. Me.
okay, can I have your attention? Okay, some questions. One at a time.
Yeah, you. -So why here in London?
we go where we're told to, like you.
how would you sum up your music? -Sex, blood and rock and roll.
okay, excuse me.
it's time.
may I present...
...the vampire Lestat.
good evening.
sorry I'm late. I was just trying to catch my breakfast.
okay, can we keep it short? One at a time.
Yeah, you.
I may be wrong, but what I remember about vampires is...
...you generally keep your identity secret.
Yes. But why hide it in this day and age?
I've hidden in the shadows for centuries.
it's time to share myself with the world.
could you prove it? You know, give us a demonstration of your powers.
if you like, I can give you a private demonstration in your hotel tonight.
your first and only concert's in Death Valley, just days away.
why just the one? -I don't like repeating myself.
there are rumors about the hidden meaning in your lyrics...
...that you're giving away vampire secrets. Is that true?
maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few old friends. Daring them to come out.
won't these vampires be pissed off that you're giving away secrets?
I imagine they are, yes.
do you have anything to say to the other vampires?
as a matter of fact, I do.
come out, come out, wherever you are.
see you all in Death Valley.
I heard Lestat keeps all these girls in his cellar. And it's nice.
they give you food and cable and weed.
Oh, please.
but you have to let him suck you on your neck whenever he wants.
doesn't sound too bad. -Done worse.
I'll say. -This way, girls.
so this is Lestat's house?
it is this week. We move around a lot.
why is that?
what can I say? The guy is just...
boss. I didn't see you there. -No. You wouldn't, would you?
these are the girls that you asked for.
Yes.
do you want me to take the girls home later?
no, thank you, Roger.
I'll make sure they're taken care of.
you want some?
want me?
you hungry?
you hungry for something else?
come on.
don't you want to have some fun? -Don't do that.
are you ticklish?
I'm very ticklish.
come out, come out...
...whoever you are.
Jesse.
Jesse.
a voice...
...calling to me...
...in my dreams.
the same dream I've had since I was 6.
I have a family of my own.
not a strange dream, really.
one every orphan has.
I'm sorry, but you must go.
why can't I stay with you? Please, Aunt Maharet.
I don't want you to go. But you must.
aunt, you're bleeding.
you must be with your own.
I knew things were not normal. -This isn't the life I wanted for you.
I only knew I was part of them, and being cast out...
was I bad?
had I done something wrong?
I'll always be watching over you.
I want to stay with you forever.
you can't.
I'm Serena Altschul, MTV News.
vampire turned rocker Lestat has returned with a new CD, Forsaken.
although from New Orleans...
...he claims to be an 18th-century French nobleman...
...who has been asleep for over 100 years.
here's a look at the new video from the debut album, "Redeemer."
like everyone, I assumed Lestat was a joke.
a rock star with a gimmick. Then one of his lyrics caught my attention.
take a walk down the aisle at the end of the mile.
give your life to my charms in the Admiral's Arms.
that rang a bell.
I tracked down old leases in London.
it turns out in the late 1600s there was a pub in Mile End...
...called the Admiral's Arms.
it had a reputation for dealing with black magic...
...and reports of people vanishing.
here's where you could find the Admiral's Arms in old London.
that part of London is mostly warehouses...
...meat-packing plants and a private club in the same location.
I think that it's a vampire coven.
and Lestat is leading us to it.
who took this picture? -I did.
you're still an apprentice. You don't do field work.
the Talamasca has a code.
I know. "Observe the dark realm, but be not of it.
well, it's held good for 12 centuries.
we record and observe, but never interfere.
I had to see it for myself.
is David aware of this?
Jesse?
Hello, David.
I was explaining-- -Why don't you see me in my office?
this is a real coven. In the middle of London.
all the more reason to have told me first.
listen, Jesse...
...we know about Lestat.
what he's doing is unprecedented.
so why is he doing it?
aren't you curious? Don't you think we should find out?
let me show you something.
what do you see?
Mid-1500s. Florence.
this one?
this man is in both. -Yes.
all the different paint samples...
...all authentic.
each painted at the time of their particular style.
his name is Marius.
I've been tracing him for years.
my little obsession.
the closest we've come to the original vampire.
marius himself dates back to 400 B. C.
so he's older than Lestat.
he made Lestat.
how do you know that?
because I have Lestat's journal.
I want to see it.
promise me you'll never go back to that place.
it was the winter of 1788.
and I was brought to a Mediterranean island by the man who made me.
if a man is what you'd call him.
lestat, welcome.
who are you?
do I know you?
I am unknowable by nature, but you may call me Marius.
I'm the lord of a great manor. They'll send an army to look for me.
I doubt they'll find you, Lord de Lioncourt.
you're a long way from home.
you're weak...
...near passing.
I can barely hear your heartbeat.
the future hastens. An age beyond my antique reason.
you will help me understand these times.
that's why I chose you.
chose me for what?
drink...
...and live.
you've been brave enough for one night, my son.
drink...
...and learn.
good, is it not?
no more. No more, Lestat.
no more!
don't be afraid.
it's only your body that dies.
more.
I impressed my maker with my thirst for things.
he set out to educate me in the unknown.
taught me all about the world, its hidden history...
...and about myself.
that's enough, my son.
when you feed, hold back from the moment of death.
never take the last drop, or it will draw you in and you will die.
appreciate your prey.
their blood that we take into us carries with it life...
...their life, their knowledge, their complexity.
my senses run amuck, like a newborn child.
and as for my new powers, I was beside myself with the pleasure of it all.
we've stayed long enough.
but we've spoken to no one.
a vampire's life is a life of discretion.
discretion?
why must we hide, Marius?
we are the powerful, we are the immortal.
we should walk fearless in the open, no?
that cannot be.
we're vulnerable during the day.
mortals must never know about us, for the sake of all our kind.
so I could never know her?
not unless you wanted to kill her.
so I can never be known?
you must be dead to the world.
come on, time to leave.
Sophia, run! Run!
go! Go
Lestat...
...stop her!
you must!
we must remain in the shadows.
you still have a few lingering mortal emotions.
they'll serve you no good, my friend.
forgive me.
the faces of my victims haunted me, reminding me of my fate.
for nights and days I played...
...furious that I would never partake of the simple joys of the world.
I was meant for more than this.
Marius?
would you like me to play for you?
what have you done, Lestat?
more! -I don't think so, my little lord.
let me go. -No.
you've had the purest blood, seen the oldest things.
far too much for one as young as you. -Her blood is like liquid fire.
who is she?
she's your mother.
she's my mother.
Akasha, the queen of all who are damned.
and he's her king.
Akasha and Enkil nearly drank this earth dry when they ruled over Egypt.
they drank until Enkil lost his will to drink.
without her mate beside her, she also lost hers. They became living statues.
she respects nothing except the taste of blood, human and immortal alike.
no. Release me!
she made you quite powerful.
you'll not stop me!
can I hear her blood in your voice?
in all the years of my care, not once have they moved.
until tonight. And she chose me.
I chose you.
where are you going?! Marius!
many times since, I have called to Marius. But there was no answer.
just the endless procession of days, months...
...years.
my teacher left me to my darkest lesson.
that in the end, we are alone.
and there is nothing but the cold, dark wasteland of eternity.
david thought the journal would satisfy my curiosity.
but it only made me want to know more.
I had to go back to the Admiral's Arms.
I had no choice.
this is a fantastic place. I love it.
you sure I can't get you a drink?
soon.
Hi.
Hi. -Come here often?
all the time.
I don't see any marks.
you haven't seen the rest of my body.
is that an invitation?
sorry, I'm taken.
and...
...where is your host?
he's here somewhere.
this host, what's his name?
Marius.
sorry, don't know the guy.
of course not. He's an ancient. -There aren't any ancients left.
they all turned to dust.
so unless you've got him in a bottle somewhere...
you're brave to joke. I wish you could meet him.
and why is that? -Because you might learn something.
excuse me.
going somewhere?
now this will only hurt a little bit.
in fact, you might even enjoy it.
don't do this.
boo.
that was quite a performance.
you should be more careful.
Thanks. -For what?
you saved me.
how presumptuous.
so you know Marius?
I know a lot of things.
not how to stay alive, apparently.
I guess we have that in common.
although I'm a little ahead of the race here.
well, I can fix that.
your song "Redeemer" is about the girl with the violin. Isn't it?
Yeah.
is it?
what else do you think you know?
l...
you're shaking.
cold.
still cold?
go on. Tell me more about me.
you want...
what do I want?
you yearn. -What do I yearn?
for what do I yearn?
to walk with the living.
out of the cold, dark wasteland of eternity.
well...
...that makes you a very clever librarian.
Talamasca.
I knew I left that journal somewhere.
was it a good read? -It touched me.
did it, now?
don't worry, Jesse.
your kind never satisfies my thirst.
lestat, I know something that's not in your journal.
what?
you still have the violin, don't you?
no, I understand.
after all, it's only human.
clever librarian.
David, listen, I'm going to Los Angeles for the concert.
I met him, David. I talked to Lestat.
what? Jesse?
listen to me very carefully now.
you are no longer seeing things clearly.
Lestat told the world that vampires live among us. They're mad.
they'll be at the concert to kill him. You've become obsessed with it.
I'm worried about you. -Don't worry about me. I'll be okay.
I'll check in and...
I'm sorry. I have to go.
no, Jesse
the city of Lost Angels already fed on the blood of youth.
my presence here barely stirred a ripple.
we had three days till the concert.
I could feel something was coming.
I just couldn't figure out what.
Marius.
Lestat.
it is good to see you, Lestat.
and you.
still wearing the old fashions, I see.
old habits die hard.
how did you manage to slip through the '50s in red velvet?
I slept.
don't think you missed much.
Elvis. -Elvis, yes.
you're bigger than he is now.
so...
after all this time...
...What's the occasion?
you've just become very hard to avoid these days, at least in conversation.
what are you trying to prove, Lestat? -Oh, please.
it's a little too late to come over all paternal now, Marius.
two hundred years and not a word from you.
you almost cost me everything.
now you've done it again.
this isn't the time to settle old scores.
vampires don't settle old scores.
we harbor them.
how did you find me?
I made you.
I've always known where you are.
besides...
...I just had to look for the most gauche house on the block.
come. Let me show you what it means to live in the light.
lmpressive.
reminds me of old mad druids running around chanting in the forest.
a return to the primitive.
out there, my fans...
...they worship me.
millions of arms reach out to embrace, beg me to come into their lives.
it's what you always wanted.
with all my black little heart.
did you think of anyone but yourself?
I only have myself. You taught me that.
it may be time to get ready for some company.
what's that supposed to mean? -Your music's woken an old friend.
can't you hear it?
or is the applause all you can hear now?
Akasha.
arisen.
she has taken the king's blood.
absorbed his power.
good. Let her come.
cancel the concert.
never.
you're no match for her, Lestat. You're not a god.
we were once mortals too.
it is our heritage we protect.
such reverence for mortals.
then you should have left me as one.
scent is fading. He was here too long ago.
you like him, do you?
he reminds me of someone.
all he's going to remind you of soon is a pile of bones.
we're going to dismember him. Bleed him dry.
Really?
is that what you're going to do?
old gods on new streets.
not only had the concert sold out among the living...
...it seemed all the undead were coming too.
there would be angry vampires out there...
...frightened of the light I was directing on all our kind.
do you have anything to say to the other vampires?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
come out, come out, wherever you are.
they wanted me dead.
let them try.
bring it on.
better dead than alone.
Hey, honey. Want tickets for tomorrow?
going to the show? -No.
come on, I got them for $200. -$200?! I don't think so.
what if I say 150? -150? You're gonna cut me a deal?
so, listen, just two girls, okay? So how old are you again?
check it out. Champagne? -Yeah.
Oh, my God, I can't believe it's really you! I'm your biggest fan.
boo.
boo back.
lestat, I came all the way from Tarzana.
Really?
and you? -London.
a London Goth. I see.
it's funny, I would have pegged you for a Talamascan.
maybe in another life.
I'm an Episcopalian.
and I'm a frigging Buddhist. Lestat...
Roger, would you take our little Episcopalian back to church?
just the one tonight? Sure.
sweetheart, come on. -What?
come on. -What?!
it's a good thing. -Can I still go backstage?
why are you following me?
what do you want?
so you come all this way just to return this to me?
out of the goodness of your heart?
I want you to show me what it's like.
what what is like, exactly?
to be like you.
I don't have time for this.
all a vampire has is time. -Not this one.
right.
the covens are coming for you.
how are you going to spend your last night, as you always have, alone?
why not?
why not share it with me?
all right.
this may be painful for a mortal.
you're still attached to your skin.
I don't care.
do you trust me?
Yes.
then close your eyes.
marius was right.
but I never understood until I met you.
what do you mean?
you're beautiful to me because you're human.
your frailty...
...your short years...
...your heart...
...even as you think it's breaking.
all that...
...seems suddenly more precious than anything I have ever known.
I'm not as precious as you think.
do it.
please.
let me be with you.
let me know everything.
you want to know everything?
come, then.
I'll show you.
what is it? What are we doing--?
is she all right?
get away! Get off me!
now you see?
are you ready?
now do you want it, huh?
no.
of course you don't.
they're pretty worked-up. How you feeling?
Hey, girls, come on!
okay, through here. Let him through!
back off, fella!
come on, children.
okay, guys. Come on!
let him through.
Jesse!
Jesse!
Hello, David.
I must show you my new paintings sometime.
find Jesse.
you want more?
this one's for those who've come for me.
Akasha.
Akasha?!
why so surprised, my love?
you called, I have come.
my love?
never fear me, Lestat.
all your wishes have come true.
my wishes?
for a companion to share eternity.
you're bold, like your music.
you live your life in the open, like I did long ago...
...when I had a king.
had a king?
he's no more.
now you are my consort.
that's why I kept you safe.
alive.
you?
you thought it was all you?
the ego of a king as well.
Yes.
I know you, Lestat.
I know that you crave to have the world at your feet.
and I have come to give it to you.
where are we?
we are home.
we live everywhere and anywhere we choose.
the world is our garden.
all these years I'd hoped this place was real.
for the first time in my life, I feel like I'm home.
strange that this journey should lead me here.
this place that's haunted my dreams.
aunt, you're bleeding.
you must be with your own.
I'll always be watching over you.
I want to stay with you forever.
forever is a very long time.
aunt Maharet.
you haven't aged, you haven't changed at all.
I was once a mortal too.
I bore a child before Akasha took me. I took care of that child...
...and her children, and her children's children.
this is our family.
my way of coping with eternity.
you are what keeps me connected to the world of the living.
when your parents died, I brought you here to take care of you.
now is not the time.
you were seeking answers and now you've found them.
the family is who you are.
drinking my blood allows you to live in the light.
and soon the sun will no longer sting your eyes.
this is but a taste of what we shall share, my love.
my king...
...behold our kingdom.
a kingdom of corpses?
Why? -Why not?
this is why you have risen?
they believed in nothing.
now they are nothing.
but you and l, we will change all that.
we will give the world something to believe in again.
now come, my love.
we have a score to settle.
since my mortal death, I have watched...
...I have guided and cared for my human family...
...generations beyond memory.
this is why we must fight Akasha.
for the sake of your great family. -The world we know is about to end.
the only way to prevent this is through Akasha's destruction.
but how?
when she gives blood, she's vulnerable.
whoever takes the last of her blood will not survive it.
what about Lestat?
Lestat has joined with Akasha. He's lost to us now. Forget him.
my children.
it warms my blood to see you all gathered...
...plotting against me.
Akasha. -Maharet.
you will address my king first. -Lestat, what has she done to you?
lestat, step aside.
never.
the world has changed since you reigned.
then we shall change it back.
humans are animals...
...brute creatures.
their destruction can only make sense. -We've found other ways to coexist.
in silence! In shadows and shame! And for what?
for respect of mortals?
they are nothing to us.
they are merely food.
Akasha, please...
you think you can change my will?
I've had enough of this discussion.
join me or die.
I will not.
I will not. -I will not.
I will not.
do you love me?
Yes. -Then prove it.
kill her.
she's nothing to me. -Just the same...
...I'd like for you to kill her.
you will not touch her! -You still think to challenge me?!
now. -No, it's all right, Aunt Maharet.
it's what I want.
how sweet.
I'm ready.
see, my children?
remember your real family!
or join hers.
now...
...give me my crown.
spoken like a true king.
come.
you see how he obeys?
you will...
...or you will all die.
that is enough, Lestat.
that is enough, Lestat! Stop!
you kill me...
...you kill yourselves.
wait, Lestat.
you must stop.
she drank Akasha's last drop.
she took Akasha's death into herself.
she's not dead.
she sleeps.
Hello?
Oh, my God!
Jesse?
Hello, David.
David, this is Lestat.
hello. -I have something for you.
I believe...
...that you wanted this back.
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.
can I ask--? -What's it like?
do you want to find out?
me?
no, I'm too old to live forever.
well, if you ever change your mind...
so this is goodbye.
Yes.
Hello, David.
hello.
Hi.
sorry to bother you.
I just, um...
do you live around here?
Yeah.
um, I'm supposed to meet my friend at this diner on, um, 4th and 7th?
right.
do you know where that is? Am I going the right way?
um...what diner?
Um...hang on.
I wrote it down somewhere.
uh, Daisy's?
Oh, yeah.
you know where it is?
Yeah.
OK, so what should I do?
Uh...OK.
um, basically, um, OK, go out this exit, go to your right, and then take the left staircase out to the floor level.
um, and then, OK, you're going to get out and go left on the street right there.
so l...
this street right here.
so I take a left when I go out to the street?
Yeah, go left, go left out of the station, left on the street, and then go, like, two blocks up, and then, um... what do you see over there?
I'm trying to think.
um...
thanks for walking with me.
it's really nice of you.
Yeah, no problem.
kind of a bad situation right now.
my friend -- I should have known.
it's typical of my friend, Samantha.
she, um...
last I heard from her was on this message where she said she had lost her phone charger.
and the only way I knew where to go was that she left me that message saying to meet at the diner, so otherwise I would be...
I don't know what I would do.
Really?
Yeah.
that sucks.
Yeah.
it does.
but anyway, she's really irresponsible, and, like, she's that kind of person where if you want to hang out at, like, 8: 00 at night or something, you should probably tell her to get ready around 7: 00.
because just give her an hour extra because she's going to be late anyway.
then she'd still be late even if you did that, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, my friend Rick is actually like that.
Really?
Yeah, like the other day we went to eat at this Mexican place, and, like, the bill came and it was like...
like I had cash and, like, he only had his card, so he was like, "Oh, I'll just pay for it on my card and you can give me cash or whatever."
and I was like, "OK, cool," like, not that big of a deal, and then, you know, like, two hours later we were at home and we realized that, like, he forgot his card at the restaurant.
but then it was even worse because then for, like, the next three days, anytime we went and, like, ate somewhere together or, like, did anything that cost money, he was like, Oh, I don't have my card.
and then, like, I was the only one who, like, had cash on me so I'd end up paying for everything, you know.
Oh, that's not cool. That's not good.
just, like, flaking and, you know, being really, like, forgetful.
Yeah, although I have to admit, I just did that about a week ago.
what? Like forgot your card somewhere?
Yeah.
although it's usually my keys that I forget because when I come home, I just, like, throw my stuff down.
I just throw my keys, but not ever in the same place.
like it's always just, like, somewhere where I can't find them.
and, like, I probably waste ten minutes a day looking for my keys.
Hey. Hey.
what's up?
uh, she's not in there, so, um, I guess I'm just going to wait inside for her, see if she calls me or shows up, you know.
OK.
cool.
well, I don't know.
nice meeting you, I guess.
Yeah, nice meeting you, too.
no luck.
no.
so do you come here a lot?
um, well, I used to, but I don't so much anymore.
my ex-girlfriend actually used to like to come here.
are we going to run into her?
no. She actually doesn't live here.
she lives in Alaska.
why Alaska?
she's from there.
she's from Alaska?
Yeah.
interesting.
what is she doing there now?
she just went back home, or...
Yeah.
she, like, teaches history.
what's her name?
Amy.
do you guys still talk a lot?
uh, not really.
we're not on bad terms, but we just don't happen to speak as much anymore.
we shared a room.
I had, you know, two roommates at the time, and she moved in with us.
so it was us two in one room and then my two other roommates, which was kind of weird because the whole, like, eight months that I was living here, and she was still in Florida.
I was kind of hanging out with them all the time because they're my friends or whatever.
and then kind of when she got here, it was more about...
I guess I sort of...
we just only kind of wanted to hang out together, so it was, like, we kind of, you know, fenced ourselves off from them even though we were all living in the same place.
it was, like, this thing that you want to just keep it to yourself, I guess, if that makes sense.
what do you think you're going to do?
that's a good question.
is this place open 24 hours or...
Yeah.
what, are you just going to hang out here all night and wait for her?
um, yeah.
you think that's a bad idea?
uh...I don't know if it's a bad idea.
maybe it's not necessarily a great idea.
I mean, I don't know what
I guess I could just keep calling her, like, try to find
I don't have her address or anything.
you can...
if you want to hang out with me, I don't mind, and I mean, just while you keep trying to find her, you know.
I mean, we could just hang out at my place so you don't have to just sit in the diner alone, you know.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, my couch is open.
it's available.
well, hopefully I won't have to spend...
no, no, no, no.
that's really nice. It's not weird.
I just hopefully won't have to spend the night or anything because I'm hoping that she'll call me back before that happens.
what are you doing now?
just making sure she hasn't called me.
I'm sorry.
I'm really, I'm really nervous right now.
I hope I'm not freaking you out or, like...
I'm just really nervous.
sorry.
can I put my stuff down, like...
Yeah, yeah, wherever.
OK.
do you want a drink or something?
sure.
let me see.
I'm not sure what we have.
looks pretty barren.
do you want, like, a drink or do you want a drinky drink?
like alcohol?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, do you want a drink?
Yeah, we can drink.
get a little loosey goosey.
all I have is this bottle of wine that I was actually kind of trying to save because my dad sent it to me.
my dad's, like, kind of a wine nut so he'll send me these random, like, wines.
I never really understand them when I get them.
like he'll talk about how great they are, and then I'll taste them, and they all taste the fuckin' same to me.
but we can try it.
I don't know.
do you know what pinot noir is?
is that good?
I think it's supposed to be better than, like, merlot or cabernet.
I like most of those that I've tried, if you want to try it.
all right. We'll give it a whirl.
thank you.
Yeah, no problem.
so this is really nice of you to let me stay at your apartment.
I know I already said this, but I really appreciate it a lot just because I don't really know what I would be doing right now if...
no, that's fine.
you know?
sorry, but I don't have any wine glasses.
would it be weird if...
I'm not really picky.
it's fine.
you want to "cheers"?
Yeah, we probably should.
OK. To what?
I have no idea.
my old man?
Nah.
why not?
why don't we just cheers to drinking this wine that I've been saving?
OK.
sounds good.
it smells weird.
it's pretty bitter.
and kind of sweet at the same time.
is that good?
it depends on what you like.
I don't really know.
do you like bitter things or do you like sweet drinks?
I guess I like sweet, maybe.
do you know how to play this keyboard?
not really.
it looks like you were trying to teach yourself right here.
Yeah.
I just hold the easy, like, chord button.
how would I make a G over here?
right here.
this is G.
that's C Major.
what's that?
is it D?
no.
d Minor.
Yeah.
so you hear the difference in this?
this sounds like it's Halloween.
OK.
Ooh, that was good.
that's good!
sounds like a real song.
Ooh, you got sad there.
that was the Halloween, wasn't it?
Yes.
you're getting good at this.
that song was genius.
I noticed you have a little recorder over here.
what's on here?
nothing.
just words.
words?
Yeah.
can I play it?
I'm curious to see what's on it.
what's that?
did I do that?
I don't even remember.
sounds like a bunch of stuff going on.
Yeah, it sounds like music that maybe I would have recorded, but I don't remember doing it, so...
but you?
like this is you, or, like, you recorded some music?
no, recorded me.
Oh, really?
Yeah, sometimes if l, like, don't feel like actually recording properly with a mike.
I'll just do that so I can remember the notes of the song or the idea, you know.
so what do you play?
I can barely play guitar and barely play drums.
and now you can play this.
Yeah, barely.
this much.
who cuts your hair?
Why? Does it look stupid?
no.
Hey.
sorry.
that's OK.
it took forever.
I couldn't find these matches.
it's so cold.
I know. I'm freezing.
it's really bad. It's so cold!
it's super windy.
I don't even know if I'm going to be able to light this.
I'll help you.
do you want to build a little fortress?
try it again.
got it.
do you always roll your own cigarettes?
no, no.
I just didn't have enough money to buy any nam-brained.
I mean, name-brand.
you just switched the letters. I do that all the time.
me, too.
how do you feel about the hair?
um...I like it.
can you tell any difference?
not really.
Yeah, me either.
I was scared. It was cause I was nervous.
I didn't want you to not like it.
no, it was a valiant effort.
Thanks.
you're welcome.
I did cut hair, though.
I wasn't pretending to cut your hair.
I mean, I did cut some so there is a difference.
no, I can feel the little, like, hairs on my neck and stuff.
Oh, can you?
it's kind of making me itch.
sorry.
no, it's OK. It's natural, it happens.
Yeah.
man, it's cold.
are you almost done with that?
what's that?
are you almost done?
Yeah, actually, I only need about half to get the fix.
I think I'm going to go and take a shower anyway just to get the, you know, get the little hairs off.
OK.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hello?
what are you doing?
it's not good.
no, I can't find my friend.
I can't find Samantha.
no, I'm not, I'm not...
I don't know what's going on.
I was staying with her.
I'm staying with some -- this guy.
I met this guy, and I'm staying with this guy.
Yeah, this guy named Charlie.
I don't really know.
it's not like that.
what else am I supposed to do?
do you know what I'm saying?
Hello?
do you want me to explain what happened?
why don't I just tell you what happened?
don't be like that.
Hello?
why did you hang up?
well...
I'm not doing anything wrong.
I would not do that.
I wouldn't do that.
fine.
Hi.
Hi. What are you doing?
just practicing.
yeah? How's that going?
it's going good.
whose is this? Is this yours?
no, it's my roommate's.
I don't even know what it does.
this is basically the most useless thing
I've ever seen in my life.
it woke you up.
Yeah, that's true.
I think it's fun.
sorry.
how'd you like my bed?
it's very comfortable.
Yeah.
are you mad?
I didn't mean to fall asleep.
no, I didn't mean to say it like that.
so...what's up?
did you find your friend?
she hasn't called.
are you sick of me yet?
no.
are you sure, because I understand if you are.
Nope, it's OK.
are you sure?
Yeah, I really have nothing else to do, so it's actually a nice, pleasant distraction.
guess what.
what?
I think I found her address, my friend's address.
how'd you do that?
the Internet. I tried to look her up.
I found it.
Really? You can do that?
Yeah, you can do that. You didn't know that?
I don't know if I like that.
well, let me see it just so l see if I know where it is.
Yeah, I wrote it down.
see anything?
you want to ring the second floor people, and maybe they'll just let us in?
how's it going?
Aah!
Shhh, someone might hear.
don't do that. Someone might hear.
are these hula hoops?
they look kind of big to be hula hoops.
I was going to say the same thing.
they look really big.
Oh, they're really heavy.
try to pick one up.
you look so beautiful.
Thanks.
you kind of look like a pilgrim.
I kind of look like a pilgrim.
but if you put this on, it's kind of like you can hear yourself really, really well.
I know.
I'm hearing really weird, too.
with that hat on?
uh...yeah, it sounds really different.
put this hat on.
OK.
it's really weird.
feast For Crows.
that's kind of a cool cover.
here.
what is that, a leaf?
that's weird.
maybe she's trying to flatten it for, like, a scrapbook.
is it flat?
do you think it's done?
I don't know. I don't want to mess it up.
I should put it back.
you're next.
kind of, um...
kind of cowardly so I don't really face the problem head on and just say, "This isn't working."
I kind of do this really half-assed gradual...
kind of just maybe try to avoid the person or ignore them until they figure it out because I'm too afraid to just do it.
I want what I do and what I feel to affect only me.
I don't want to be responsible for other people and what they feel, you know?
does that make any sense?
well, I guess I've been dating people like you for the past couple of relationships until now, and now I'm you.
but I don't really like that, but I do know for sure that I don't want to be with that person.
Yeah.
I don't know.
do you think it's like that we're just kind of, like, naive and impatient, and then when you get older, you sort of mature into, like, a person that can actually sustain a real relationship?
or is it that you just...
you know, you're stubborn when you're young, and then as you get older, you kind of lower your standards and settle?
I hope that's not true.
I don't like the latter at all.
what was the first one again?
you just, you hope that we're going to grow up?
that we'll grow up and be able to not freak out when it starts to get, you know, intense and not feel trapped, yeah.
right.
and just kind of actually go with it.
well, this is my first time feeling like that.
my bouncy ball doesn't work in the grass.
Really?
Yeah, you try it.
it sort of does.
let me try one more time.
that's not very fun.
no, it's better on the pavement.
you want to have a race?
you want to race?
Yeah, I want to race.
are you fast?
maybe.
are you fast?
probably.
probably?
all right, where are we going to race to?
that brown patch of grass and back.
to your jacket?
no.
to this.
OK.
ready?
hold on. Get behind it.
OK, ready?
all right, wait.
does it go, "1, 2, 3, go," or, "1, 2, 3" and 3 means go?
1, 2, 3...go!
OK.
ready?
1, 2, 3...go.
I beat you.
I think I swallowed something on the way back.
like a bug?
Yeah.
I ran track in high school.
Really?
Yeah.
but I'm out of shape now.
me, too.
but I still beat you!
I know. I'm terrible.
so I'm not holding you back from doing anything today, am l?
Nope.
you sure?
Yep.
well, do you want to go to my friend Robin's art gallery tonight?
is it going to be totally awesome?
Yeah, it's going to be totally awesome.
Robin's totally awesome.
all right, then I'll go.
it's at 6: 00.
it's at 6: 00?
you know what I could do, actually?
what?
while we're in the neighborhood, I could go get my hat.
my friend has had this hat that I own.
OK.
and he's had it forever.
OK.
I could get it back from him.
let's get it.
is that OK?
Yeah.
whatever you want to do.
Yeah, let's do that. You want to go now?
Yeah.
I'm still out of breath.
are you?
a little bit.
which one is it?
those are sort of backwards.
maybe he's not here.
Hello?
Hey, man, it's Charlie.
I was taking a nap.
Oh, sorry.
um, I don't know, can we come up?
what? Did you say, "Can we come up?"
Yeah.
who are you with?
um, my friend.
who's your friend?
open the door, please.
what? I can't understand you.
I don't know.
come on, can we please come in?
did I hear a girl's voice?
Yeah.
who are you, stranger?
I think he said, "Who are you, stranger?"
I'm Jamie.
Hey, Charlie, my friend.
hold on. Step back from the peep hole.
are you serious?
I can't focus you.
Hey, buddy, how's it going?
how you doin', man?
good. Good to see you. It's been a long time.
Hey, you guys got to take your shoes off.
it's a house rule.
are you serious?
Yeah.
no shoes on the rug or beyond this point, basically.
OK.
come on in.
my name is Adam.
I'm Jamie.
nice to meet you.
wow, that's a strong handshake.
boy.
Charlie, today, man.
sorry.
what do you got there?
got where?
never mind.
they're stool coasters, chair coasters.
I don't know what they're called.
Jess likes them, but, you know, cause they keep the rug smooth, but you can see them, you know.
you don't like that you can see them?
well, I don't care.
I'm just saying you can see them.
I like your curtains here.
did you pick all this stuff out?
I did not.
I picked out very little of this stuff.
who picked it out? Your girlfriend?
my future wife.
Wow. Since when?
since when?
um, since...
june is when I proposed, is when I got down on one knee and...
what do you say?
made it...made, uh...
made her an honest woman.
I don't know.
guys don't wear rings, though.
there's no way...
to know.
Yeah.
how long have you been dating?
seven years.
impressive, right?
it's a long time.
it's almost, like, embarrassingly long to now finally be engaged.
you wanted to be engaged...
well, it's like, you know, once you've reached the seven-year point and then you're like, "Oh, now we're engaged?"
it's like we might as well have gotten engaged four years ago.
he really just found out she had all this nice shit.
Yeah, I found that out.
she finally invited me into her place, and I was like, "Whoa, you've got a cool apartment."
can I live here?
out came the ring.
Yeah.
uh, Charlie?
Adam.
what are you doing here?
um, I just thought I'd pay you a visit.
no, I actually...I wanted to get my hat that you've had for ages that I am going to need to reclaim.
that figures that the first time I see you
how does that figure?
you're all locked up in paradise here.
I've got your hat.
thank you.
you're welcome.
are you invited to the wedding?
Yeah, of course.
are you going to be the best man?
um, I don't think so.
I think somebody else snatched it.
I appreciate the use of that fine hat.
how did it work out for you?
it worked out great.
that's a great hat.
Hey, are you guys hungry?
do you guys like cole slaw?
Yeah.
you want some?
I've got this great cole slaw that I'm actually really hungry for.
and so I figure if I'm going to go get myself some...
I feel like cole slaw is not something that our generation really appreciates as its own thing.
I get it for sides at restaurants all the time.
Yeah, but it's a side.
it's been relegated to the sides of other meals.
but I'm saying I just sometimes eat cole slaw.
like a salad of cole slaw?
not like anything.
just a big old bowl of cole slaw.
it's good, right?
Yep.
there's more where that came from.
eat up.
Where's your hat?
what's that?
my electric bill, but it's, like, always incorrect.
I need a...
something to spread the mayo.
use this.
Yeah, but we just used that.
is yours delicious?
it's pretty awesome.
is it?
Yeah.
are you afraid to try this?
to what?
to try this?
sort of.
that is a slathering of the mayonnaise and mustard.
eat your own sandwich!
I am.
OK, I'm going to cut it in half first.
this is the worst game I've ever played.
that's funny.
isn't that good?
that's kind of enjoyable.
I know.
can I take a shower? Do you mind?
no.
Hey, Charlie?
Charlie?
Oh, my God! Jamie!
I can't believe you came!
you look great!
it's so good to see you...
it's great to see you, too!
...in New York!
I'm so excited to be here!
I have this friend, Paul, who kind of treads the androgyny line, and I was sort of inspired by him.
um, I think I'm going to get another one...
which one?
the blue and green one.
it's, like, the only one that I really can, like, definitely say I'm proud of.
Charlie Miller.
what the fuck is up, buddy?
how's it going?
what the fuck are you doing here?
nothing, you know.
checking out some art.
yeah?
Yeah.
are you writing a paper?
what?
are you writing a paper?
on...
the art?
no.
I don't think I've seen you come out of Park Slope in what, like a month?
uh, I leave. I come out.
yeah?
get the paper or something like that?
I'm out right now.
Yeah, you are right now.
well, why don't you call me back sometime?
what do you mean?
like I don't know, I called you like two weeks ago.
still haven't heard from you.
no, seriously, like, what are you doing?
I mean, I haven't seen you in, like, a month.
I don't know.
I mean, I've been kind of...
well, I haven't really been that busy.
just forget it.
who the fuck is this?
I'm Jamie. Hi.
Hi.
so what are you... how'd you end up here?
you just were like, "Hey, I want to come out of Park Slope for the first time in a year, so I'm going to go to an art show"?
well, no, her friend is actually...
Yeah, Robin did...
Oh, Robin's your friend?
Yeah, from high school.
Yeah, I know Robin. That's why I'm here.
Oh, great.
I met Robin, like, a year ago.
it was one of those, like, here's some rock bands and here's some art and here's some, you know, face painting, and get some cotton candy.
this little carnival thing.
that's awesome.
it was, like, over on the piers.
OK.
are you from here?
no, no, I'm from Atlanta actually.
I was here visiting not Robin, but another friend, who I can't find, so...
isn't Robin from Atlanta?
Yeah, she is.
so you've known her for, like, a long time, right?
Yeah, we pretty much grew up together.
was she always like that?
like too cool for school and all that?
too cool for school? Kind of.
that's kind of Robin.
but maybe now more so -- her hair.
I haven't seen her hair like that.
what do you do?
well, right now I work at, um, a restaurant.
Oh, yeah? What kind of restaurant?
a chain restaurant.
what do you mean "a chain restaurant"?
like Long John Silver's?
not quite.
like at the drive-thru, you're like, "No fish sticks.
Applebee's, actually.
Applebee's!
you're not gearing up to what, go back to Florida, are you?
what?
last time I talked to you, you said you were like, "Oh, I'm moving back to Florida, I'm done with this," and all that, "it's too cold up here, I hate it.
I didn't know that.
no, he's, like, hung up on some girl back in Florida.
no, I'm not.
whatever. You talk about her, like, all the time.
no, I don't! No, I don't!
I'm just saying, I mean, if you move back to Florida, I'm just letting you know right now that that means officially you and I are no longer friends.
that's all. That's all.
well, thanks a lot for that.
it's just a rule I have to make.
this is my good friend, so you better be nice to her.
Jamie. Yeah, I met Jamie.
he's been OK. Not too bad.
I had my shots today.
I'm totally right.
your shots, or your shots?
no, both.
OK.
that's good work.
Thanks.
is that sincere?
do you... so do you know Robin?
no, we just met.
Oh, OK.
me and him, way back.
Yeah, sure.
Really?
Yeah.
like this.
high school, middle school...
isn't that kind of weird that they go back and we go back?
you guys know -- for real?
Yeah, Charlie Miller.
tell me something about Charlie.
Charlie used to...
wait, wait, wait.
OK, uh, tell me...
tell me something that you know about Charlie from hanging out with him for a day, and then we'll ask, we'll ask Kyle, because I don't believe him.
should I whisper it to you?
Yeah, whisper it to me.
all right, all right.
what have you been doing for the past day?
nothing.
we've just been hanging out.
OK, What is Charlie's least favorite aspect of getting his hair cut?
um, any part of it.
paying for it.
so you're saying he's stingy.
the back, the back -- making the back look right.
no, it's wrong. It's the itchy hair.
he doesn't like having itchy hair down his shirt.
I never cut his hair when we were in high school or middle school because that's not something you do.
like who does that, like, "Hey, guy, let's put this Nintendo 64 down and cut each other's hair"?
who does that? Friends.
we've gotten our hair cut together.
OK, you're girls.
I've cut her hair, actually.
what guy, except for the military, gets their hair cut together?
I mean, seriously.
so you guys really...
I'll give you $20.
go find me a guy who got his hair cut with his friend on a regular basis, enough to know he doesn't like what, itchy hair?
how does she know that?
is that even true?
I don't like it.
she gave me a haircut, man.
I thought you met her yesterday!
it was yesterday.
what is wrong with you?
you just meet some girl and you're like, "Hey, what's up? Cut my hair, girl."
you can't even tell.
that's like a $200 haircut in this city.
you gave her $200 for that haircut?
that will be $250.
I barely did anything. I was a little nervous.
can you cut my hair?
I thought you worked at Applebee's.
you cut hair, too?
Yeah, I do, on the side.
Kyle, be nice.
she brought it up.
I didn't tell you to be rude to my friend.
do you guys, like, want to leave soon?
sure.
I'm just kind of...
OK.
yeah?
are you guys coming?
where?
Ah, I think, actually, a bunch of people are coming to my house later, but it'll be a little while.
do you just want to sort of chill out and listen to music?
we got a girl.
ask the girl.
if you meet some strange guy and you go home
I'm not a strange guy.
he's not that strange.
he's a stranger.
and you go home with him, and you sleep over at his house, doesn't that mean you kind of dig him?
Yeah.
OK, ready?
let me see.
do you know Robin?
uh, not really.
I went with a friend of hers, and I mean, I subsequently met her, but I don't know her very well.
do you live in the city?
Yeah, I live in Park Slope.
nice.
I live in Park Slope, too.
that's a lovely place to be.
Yeah, it's great.
and what do you do?
as of right now, not much.
I actually, I just quit my job a few weeks ago, and I've just kind of been slinking around, you know.
I've heard of that.
I think I've done that.
actually I'm doing that, too, to be honest.
slinking around.
how's it going for you?
it's not paying the rent, really, but I'm hoping someday it will.
I'm waiting for the glory to come.
Yeah, we need to devise a plot to where we can basically do absolutely nothing and get our bills paid.
I don't know.
what happened?
nothing.
nothing happened?
no, I mean, some stuff happened.
what happened?
I don't know. Just some stuff.
what? You don't have to tell me.
I didn't sleep with him, though.
but the thing is that, like, you know, I've just sort of had, like, a hard time, um...
crossing that line a little bit, and I don't really know why.
like a lot of, like, my, like, recent boyfriends, like, I've just had, like, such an intense connection to them kind of emotionally and we just talk about so much stuff that l, um...
it's sort of hard for me to, like, imagine, like, being sort of, like, sexy with them when, like, it's sort of like it's all, like, cute and, like, sweet and, like, intense but like in a cerebral way, kind of.
you, like, see these, like, movies and, like, these sex scenes are, like, so animalistic, and l, like, don't... I don't know.
I just, like, don't
I can't, like, I can't reconcile, like, something like that with, like, something like what I've had with these people that I've sort of had, like, a little bit longer term relationships with, you know.
um, so I guess I decided recently that, like, what I really needed was, like, someone, like, totally hot, like, unquestionably hot that was kind of a jerk maybe and so I could just get over it.
so you could cross the line.
well, maybe just get over some of it, you know, because, like -- and someone maybe who I didn't have to...
like, I would never do anything with anyone who, like, I didn't feel, like, a connection to, but I kind of just wanted, like, to not have to worry about...
like, I didn't want this, like, long history, like, I didn't want all these memories of us, like, sort of having, like, this, you know, psychological stuff going on.
I just wanted it to be, like, sort of more visceral.
I think that's what I need.
I've had some drinks, I will confess.
what's your drink of choice?
well, the gallery had beer, so I drank that.
and, um, there was a few nips of something along the way.
I don't know, I haven't really been
like illicit nips, or liquid nips?
liquid.
what would be illicit?
well, there's, you know, there's pills, there's powders, there's pipes...
no, none of that.
strictly something you put in a glass.
and is legal.
Yeah.
but, uh...
like, I remember this one time, um, I was sitting in that chair over there, and he was, like, lying on his stomach, like, on the bed, and we were just listening to music and stuff, and l, like...
I never would have, like, asked anyone this before, but he was lying on his stomach, like, reading a book, and I was just like, "Hey, Scott, can I ask you something?"
and he's, like, "What?"
and I was like, "Can I just, like, lay on top of you?"
what did he say?
he was, like, "Uh...OK."
so l, like, came over here and, like, just laid, like, directly, like, stacked, like, right on top of him and just laid on top of him, and, like, we talked for a while.
and I just remember thinking, like, you know, like one of my roommates, like, here, like, has never even had a boyfriend, and, like, I just remember, like, saying to him, like, this, like, feels really good.
like, I don't even know you that well.
it just feels really good to, like, be, like, close to someone and stuff.
and it wasn't, like, really, like, a sexual thing.
it was kind of like I was fully clothed, just, like, laying on top of him, and I was just like, just sort of felt, like, sort of sad in that moment for, like, people who, like, don't have, like, that, like, contact ever.
you know what I mean?
because, like, in a sense, like, it was like, in a sense it was, like, all I needed.
like I didn't even need, like, I didn't even need, like, to get over, like, all this stuff really.
like, I think that's really just what I needed was just, like, closeness and, like, being, like, comfortable with someone, and I think that's why it was so hard to, like, say the things that I said to him that night, like, when I sort of told him that I couldn't do it anymore.
I talked to this girl, and her dad, like, runs some old carpet place, and she can get, like, remnants, like, old carpet pieces and then just, like, sew the edges.
it's, like, 50 bucks to sew the edges.
so I got, like, a bunch of, like, little weird rugs.
I feel really bad.
no, you should not feel bad.
I just have this class tomorrow.
Oh, my God.
you should have told me you had class tomorrow.
Hey.
how's it going?
good.
I'm just...
enjoying the taps?
Oh, yeah, messin' around.
what have you been doing?
nothing, just walking around.
talk to anybody interesting?
talked to the same folks.
folks.
but no, you can't really get into anything that important in this environment, can you?
depending.
depending if, you know, what both people want to talk about.
what's that for?
your concert.
my playing?
I was kind of trying to be quiet.
watch.
this is a good technique for high-five.
if you look at my elbow and I look at yours, supposedly we'll connect better.
instead of hands.
Yeah, like, don't look at my hand when you move.
look at my elbow, and I'll look at yours.
OK, ready?
ready, go.
wait, hold on.
OK.
do it again.
you know, I mean, I don't want to, like, stop your fun.
you should have told me earlier when I said about the sort of party.
maybe if we could, like, lower the music or something, and you can blame it on me.
you can tell everybody that I'm a horrendous awful...
no, you're not a horrendous awful.
I would never say that!
I would never say that.
you have to find it.
it's, like, way back here.
this thing?
Yeah.
make it as tight as possible.
I'm giving the doubled up...
it's like, here's the single one
not this one.
Yeah, I know.
this one.
you just have to...
I don't know how to describe it.
you just...
I'm doing it.
yeah...
you said, "I'm doin' it."
I'm doin' it.
OK.
looks good.
Thanks.
when is your birthday officially?
my birthday is October 28.
I just have a dollar but I can sign it if you want.
OK. Can you sign it?
the good thing about that is I can cash
well, it is cash.
I can't cash this.
this is a totally erroneous present, as far as I'm concerned.
that's why you should just smash it over your head.
but it's not erroneous.
I like it, though.
that was nice of him to give it to me.
do you want the dollar or not?
Yeah, I want the dollar.
Bye.
it was good meeting you.
I don't know if I'll see you again.
we'll do hugs.
we're doing hugs.
it was nice meeting you.
Bye.
all right, guys.
have a good night.
Hey, so you're...
Oh, no, I'm going to...
