And even if the engineering can be perfected, it remains to be seen how many daredevil billionaires will be willing to spend months cooped up in a metal tube eating freeze-dried food.

spacex already makes much of a comment last year by a chinese government official, that the firm's launch costs are the lowest in the world and that china's own rockets cannot hope to match them.

spacex has already slashed the cost of rocket launches, outperforming the world's national space programs.
spacex has said the capsule has the world's most durable heat shield, to protect dragon and its contents during re-entry.

spacex, short for space exploration technologies corporation, is one of two private companies that nasa has contracted to transport cargo to the international space station.
