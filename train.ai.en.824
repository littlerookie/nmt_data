I want to learn Kal Ho Na Ho's title track.

very nice! Sir, will I learn this? It's my big wish.
no worries, man. I will make you a rock star.
in seven months.
Savio will make you a rock star in seven months.
sorry, Savio sir. But can't you do it in three months?
fool! What do you think?
I am sitting here and running a crash course or something?
you thought you will come, put the guitar in your pelvis...
...and become Elvis!
playing the guitar is an art.
no matter how much time you take, it's less.
sorry, Savio sir.
there are ways to go there. Why don't you understand?
since the time I have become sensible...
...I have been going to dance bars.
I've got work!
I've got work, Mr. Amar!
please! Concentrate! Give your time!
otherwise, I will be in trouble.
please! Concentrate on your life!
listen! - Yes, sir!
did you get the files?
Yes, sir. Namdev just kept it here.
fine. It should be finished by tomorrow.
tomorrow? But sir... Hello.
you too! He says and you listen to him.
he orders you around and you do his bidding.
he exploits you and you get scared.
people suppress the weak ones. Got it?
like button, bell etc.
this is Amar Kaul's problem.
people bully him and he allows them to.
what?
nothing.
what? - Nothing.
hang on!
what? - Nothing.
what?
nothing.

I gave the car loan file to boss. What's its status?
you ask him.
okay. I will ask him.
sir...
car loan... - It can't be done.
why, sir? - What do you mean?
have you seen the state of our city?
there is so much traffic.
it takes me one and half hour at least...
...to come here from Shivaji Park.
and so much pollution!
I don't want to add to the city problems.
Mr. Kaul, before asking for a loan, think how much money the company has earned because of you.
first earn and then ask for a loan.
be an asset to the company and not a liability.
what?
nothing.
nothing. Then go out. And throw this in the dustbin.
make the report and bring it.
I have to send the report to the headquarters by evening.
sir, would you please take a look at it?
I want you to give it a look.
let's have a look.
take it outside.
sir, here.
good morning, Sir!
good morning! - Good morning, sir!
sir, I sit here.
where is it, Mr. Kaul? Where is it?
here is Acme chemical file.

what! You deleted this!
no.
this...
now I have deleted it. Permanently.
Mr. Amar Kaul! I am going to cut you into pieces!
Mr. Dasgupta. - Yes.
what?
nothing.
nothing! Nothing!
God, I don't want anything from You.
I just want my husband!
what do you mean left it? Do you get jobs easily?
don't do anything good!
now what will you do?
I will buy a car, mama.
poor Saloni!
I just want my husband's love!
amazing, Sir. You organised your finance so quickly.
being an account manager has some benefits.
congratulations on your new car! - Thank you!
just sign this insurance cover note. Then we are done.
here. Excuse me!
does it take you two weeks to repair a car's AC?
I have been calling at your service centre since long!
no response! Is this how you treat your customers...
Hi. - Hi.
I want to see my car right now! Come!
sorry about that, sir.
at times there is overload of work. - Its okay.

Yes.

sir, now what test drive? Now the car is yours.
but I didn't drive it.
no problem. Come. Let's go for a drive.
sir, actually my shift is over. And I have to go somewhere.
that's even better. I will drop you there.
no, no, sir! - In the new car!
no, sir! It's out of the way! Let it be!
it's okay. I insist. If you don't mind.
okay, Sir. Because you insist.
I will just come, sir. One minute.
thank you!
sir, the car which you have bought... very good choice.
sir, this car's rack and steering wheel...
...are perfect for close manoeuvring.
I can see.
Hey! Shameless! Blind auto driver!
I have just bought a car. Gradually I will learn abuses too.
sir, all this is common.
sir, do you know, you have a CD changer in this car?
yes? - Yes. There is a four way speaker.

if I say that...
just a second.
hello. Yes.
Yes. Okay. Okay.
I will see you. Alright. Bye.
sir, drop me ahead to the left.
my boyfriend is waiting for me.
sir, not here. Ahead. Near CCD.
that's it! He is right there.
thank you for the ride, sir.
you are welcome. You stay here?
no. Actually we have come here to see a house on rent.
anyway, sir. Congratulations once again!
remember that your car's first servicing is after three months.
okay. Thank you so much, sir. See you.
come on! Let's go!
Hi! - Hi!
who's he?
that's a friend who dropped me. - Right.
ready? - Yes.
alright.
I should have bought a bike.
you fool... forget a bike.
even if you had got a Boeing 747...
...still you would not have enticed her.
did you forget Neha?
Neha. Amar Kaul's first love.
and Amar Kaul's second love too.
and Amar Kaul's third love too.
you fool, do something soon. You don't have much time.
what?
Yes!
o my God!
mama, what are you doing?
how come my heart is so big?
mama, this is not your heart. This is my stomach's x-ray.
your stomach? What happened to you?
nothing. A small problem, mama.
problem is not in the stomach. Its here.
you and your superstitions.
I should get my x-ray done!
the maid which you have kept...
...we don't come to know when she comes, adds chillies in the vegetables and when she goes away.
it means today again somebody didn't eat food.
mama, let's do one thing.
today we will have dinner outside and we'll go in our new car.
our car?
Yes, mama. Our new car.
my son! Well done!
let's go. - Come on!
God! You are great!
you have done a great deed, son! Very good, my son!
you have bought a fabulous car!
your papa used to...
isn't it good, mama? - Yes.
let's go and have dinner.
let's have some delicious meal!
put the seat belt, mother. - Belt.
belt! Belt! - Mama!
come on!
mama, it's a belt!
it will get stuck.
mama, don't worry.
okay! Okay! - Yes!
mama, if you wear the seat belt then even if...
...there is an accident, still nothing happens.
I see! - Okay!
I will die when I have to die.
very good, my son!
very good!
brown girl in the ring.

I have to reach at 6 o'clock.
but Sir, now its only 3 o'clock.
I don't own a car like you, man.
I have to change two buses and one local train to reach there.
Vasai is far away from here.

Savio sir, forget the bus stop. I will drop you to Vasai.
I just needed a small favour from you.

I couldn't recognise you!
Really? - Yes.

Yes! Whatever!
and what was that secretary's name, he was so grumpy.

this is what I am planning.
Amar won't say anything.

he used to do everything secretly.
you know, every evening, we used to meet...
...in the compound of our building and we used to play dumbsheras . that guessing game...
Yes. I know. We played in Delhi too.
not like Amar and me.
I was the master. And Amar was the partner. Right, Amar?
he would give the clue. I would guess.
I would guess. He would give the clue.

Yeah! Undefeated chums of Shraddha society.

to make smiling faces cry.
this life, this world.
its all ours.
of crazy people.
old friend.
gun master! - G9!
I love you! - You are mine!
gun master G10! Where the hell have you been, man?
I am in Mumbai. How are you? Foreigner!

you are coming here? - Of course!
Wow! When? - Very soon! I want to meet you.
Hello! Hello, Amar!
it got disconnected.
who was that?
Amar Kaul. My school friend. He was my best friend.
I told you about him, didn't I? He is coming here.
I cannot tolerate cold easily.
excuse me, ma'am.
thank you.
keep it down.
thank you.
do it in this.
excuse him. He is travelling in a plane for the first time.
but, he has hit two birds with one stone.
Yes.
a foreign trip... and Rajiv Jhulka.
Amar and Rajiv, best friends since childhood.
best buddies and pals.
Rajiv, you keep the bigger one.
thank you. - Welcome.
Rajiv, you keep the bigger one.

he should be coming out now.
G9!
I have come for you!
how are you?
I am fine, how are you?
Rajiv Jhulka, chutney and bread.
Amar Kaul, where is my rice?
why have you become so thin?
but you look so fit.
I am a doctor, I have to maintain myself.
why are you wearing a sweater? Is it going to snow here?
you know mummy, you are going to a foreign country...
...Wear the sweater and the suit too.
look, what I brought for you.
tamarind sweets.
you like them a lot, don't you?
you like it.
and how is sister-in-law? - She is fine.
Wow. - Welcome.
such a big swimming pool! - It is a lake.
we can go swimming in the evening.
do you want to come along?
you forgot, I still don't know swimming.
and this...
the water is spilling from the pot... seems completely Indian.
fishes. - There is a tortoise too.
it is such a splendorous house.
is it yours? - Yes.
seems like people often fall ill here.
take a seat.
so, you have arrived.
that's my wife, Aditi. - Sister-in-law!
no, no.
Aditi, that's Amar.
nice to meet you.
take a seat. - You sit too.
Rajiv and I were in the same school.
and, in the same society too.
Shraddha society, Vile Parle. Remember.
vile Parle, east.
and now, Rajiv has come so far.
how did you do all this?
how do you feel?
I didn't do anything, it all happened.
to tell you the truth, Amar, everything is fine...
...but there is no fun living in an unknown city.
we miss India a lot.
we yearn so much to speak Hindi.
don't worry, now I have come here.
I will talk only in Hindi. - Promise.
don't you come to India?
I do, sometimes.
but I don't get time from my work.
Oh yes... you... - I'll be there in half an hour.
you are a doctor too. Both of you are so busy.
such a big house.
you don't get time.
Amar... - What happened?
I will have to leave, there is an emergency operation.
Oh yes, it is your duty.
please, of course. - You will be okay?
of course.
I have set up your room upstairs.
I will show him around. - Okay!
Bye, see you.
we will meet in the evening. - Of course.
we will drink.
Bye! - See you.
this is my first foreign trip.
really.
I never travelled out of India before.
this is my first foreign trip.
is it for business or any work?
no, I just came to meet G9!
Rajiv! - Oh yes.
I call him G9!
Gunmaster G9!
Gunmaster G10!
both of us were very active members of the Mithun Chakraborty fan club.
we would never miss any of Mithun's movies.
first day first show.
Rajiv and I!
he is my best friend.
and, you should meet your best friend sometimes.
that's why, I came here.
and... this is my passport and some money.
if you can keep them safely... - Of course.
Amar, I am so sorry.
I didn't even ask you anything.
would you like to have something?
tea, juice.
no, no, no sister-in-law, don't worry.
I have eaten in the plane.
they feed you so much, that now I have developed gas.
but, just get me a glass of water.
of course, I will be right back.
Amar, I have kept water for you.
thank you sister-in-law!
are you sure?
but Salvatore is... - Cancer medicine.
your friend is suffering from cancer.
Oh God.
but, why didn't he tell me?
don't you see, Rajiv?
see what?
you haven't met him for 12 years.
and now, suddenly he wants to meet you.
so, what are you saying?
don't you remember, my uncle had arrived?
I am missing my nephew! I am missing my nephew!
and ultimately, what did he say.
free treatment for kidney failure.
free doctors.
stop it, please!
Amar is my friend, he is not like that.
and if there is any problem, if he doesn't have money...
...we can afford it, can't we?
calm down! Why are you getting angry?
I was just...
did he eat?
I will call him but please don't say this in front of him.
please.
Amar... - I am not hungry, you have your food.
the world seems lonely, still!
my dream, so innate.
the world seems lonely, still!
my dream, so innate.
darkness within the shimmer of the city.
sorrow is hidden behind every smile.
if this is true then let me live each moment to its fullest.
and smilingly I will say to sorrow.
goodbye!
goodbye!
no, no you go! I don't want!
not interested! You go!
see, I don't want! I told you!
I am not interested.
I don't want!
please go.
I am so sorry!
see...
I didn't mean it.
this is life!
this is life!
it was about to end in four months.
then why all this?
things we did and things to do.
new car. Foreign trip. Guitar. Rajiv Jhulka.
it's a joke.
everything is a joke.
everything is a joke.
why am I doing it?
Why?
I know...
I know what to do?
I know what to do?
sorry, mama.
you don't know what has happened with me.
everything is going wrong.
o God, what is this?
she doesn't even let me die in peace.
I told you to leave me alone.
good sandwich.
where am... I from?
I am from India.
Mumbai!
do you know Mumbai?
Bollywood.
Yes, Bollywood!
somebody should love me for a moment.
even if it's fake.
somebody should love me for a moment.
even if it's fake.
someone expresses his love for just two days.
someone expresses his love for just two days.
even if it's fake.
somebody should love me for a moment.
even if it's fake.
Hello, Rajiv, this is Amar speaking.
where are you, Amar?
that day you left just like that without saying anything.
sorry... I was... but, I am absolutely fine.
and I am having a lot of fun.
don't worry about me.
but, do you know how worried we are.
we have been looking for you for three days now.
where are you? Just come back.
there is no time left for me to come back.
my flight leaves in the evening.
what do you mean you are leaving?
I saw you after 12 years, how can you just leave like that?
you are needlessly getting emotional.
there is nothing like that, Rajiv.
just come back home, okay.
please.
look, I wanted to meet you and I did.
I wanted to see a foreign country and I did.
this is my life's most memorable trip.
and, I am very happy.
and I want to go back happily.
I have given sister-in-law my passport and money to keep it safely.
will you please bring it to the airport?
give my regards to sister-in-law!
there is no time, otherwise I would I would have personally...
okay, I will be there.
God! - What happened?
is he alright?
he is leaving.
somebody should love me for a moment.
even if it's fake.
where is my shirt?
for me!
even I play the guitar.
I like it, thank you.
I go back, to Mumbai.
I go back.
no, I never come back.
goodbye!
goodbye!
goodbye!
what is this?
it is a strange place.
your passport, ticket.
Oh yes, passport, wallet.
Rajiv, there's some money missing, did sister-in-law...
do you want some money?
I was just joking.
you traveled so far to meet and in this condition.
and I'm really feeling sorry.
fine, on that note, treat me to a coffee.
you keep the bigger one.
it's an old habit.
do one thing.
cancel your ticket, and come with me.
there are many cancer specialists...
...I will get your treatment done.
trust me.
Rajiv, what are you saying?
you are a doctor too.
and where are you from?
you are from India.
the best doctors in the world come from India.
india is great.
don't worry.
don't worry!
did sister-in-law like the bag I brought for her?
fax me all the reports that the doctors give you.
okay.
I will consult my friends.
fine.
promise.
fine, now I will leave.
the flight has been announced.
I might miss the flight.
Bye, Amar.

okay, see you Gunmaster G9!
see you G10!

Bye.
keep fighting.
[LOVE]
Hey, lover boy.
tell me something, do you remember Neeraj Paudwal?
3rd A! The one who did the Horlicks ad.
my photo is in the papers!
my photo is in the papers!
Wow!
look, my photo is in the papers.
has your photo ever been printed in the newspaper?
see, you still remember.
he never let me forget.
because of him, I would think everyday...
...when my photo will be published in the newspaper.
but, there is a point in this.
when your photo is published in the newspapers...
...your saga can continue even after you are dead.
isn't it?
photo... on... the front... page.
when all of this has happened...
...Then, maybe this dream will come true too.
may be.
have fun.
goodbye, lover boy.
why are you looking at, Savio sir?
it is an imported one, I have brought it for you...
...Absolutely duty free. - Thank you.
but I prefer whiskey.
I always say, when the spirit is so white...
...Something is not right.
but, what I can do is... I will give it to Mario.
he will like it very much.
if you don't mind, that is.
who is Mario?
my younger brother.
the one who lives in Vasai.
keep quiet.
why are you getting tense? I am going to meet him today.
doesn't your brother ever visit you?
in '87 he fell off the local train...
...and lost both his legs.
poor man.
but, now he is fine and cranky.
and after two glasses of Vodka...
thank you.
do you have only one brother? - Yes.
only one.
Savio! And Mario!
brothers in arms.
why are you staring at that aunt?
look at me.
take a look at me.
I have a car, bungalow, bank balance.
I have laptops, computers.
mobile phones, 10 mega pixels.
and then, I have your punch line too.
I have a mother too.
actually, because of the parade every morning outside the police quarters...
...Mother cannot sleep.
and that's why, these days she sleeps in my house.
because I have an AC!
I speak English.
cut! Cut! Cut!
what happened?
great sir. - Arun. - Yes sir.
sir, it is getting a bit loud.
loud! Hello.
you have to be a bit loud, it is a T. V serial.
T. V serials have to be loud.
even the AC is not working here.
but still please attend to it.
if you do it a bit subtly, it will be really nice.
hello. Who is this?
you have called on this number? - Who is this speaking?
I... can I talk to Vivek Kaul.
sir is in a very important discussion.
call him later.
look, tell him that it is very important.
I told you, he is in a very important discussion.
do one thing, leave a message.
no, I want to talk to him personally, no message...
if it's so important, then send your resume...
...and your photographs, everything in the office.
do you have the address?
what nonsense?
he has become such a big director...
...that he can't even talk to his brother for two minutes?
selfish person.
go to hell all of you.
has the connection got cut off? What has happened to our T. V?
this is too much now.
this Amar... he doesn't even charge the battery.
and all the...
I... I... have mother.
I know that she is constable Kallu's mother.
Chintu's mother. Pappu's mother.
but mother is after all a mother. You are strange.
suresh sir, just a second. Sorry.
give sir the script. - Yes.
Yes, tell me. Mama is fine, isn't she?
thank you.
it's very hot.
and there is a lot of traffic too.
how is your shooting going? - Fine.
mama watches your serials a lot.
where is mama?
she has gone to the temple.
vivek, why don't you keep mama with you?
keep her with me!
Why? Is mama feeling to affectionate towards me?
she is your mama too.
and she feels like staying with you too.
look, mother is growing old...
...and we have some responsibilities.
just a minute, brother. It is your responsibility too.
which responsibility did you fulfill?
who broke the relations?
me or you?
just forget what happened?
vivek, it happens. It happens in a family.
it happens in every home.
brother, your family doesn't throw you out of the house for one mistake.
and what was the mistake?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I married the girl I loved.
and Dorice and I are very happy.
I agree, whatever happened was very wrong.
and I am happy to know that you are very happy with Dorice.
but, what about mama?
listen to me.
I want mama to stay with you for a few days.
brother, but I don't want it.
why don't you?
why don't you want it?
isn't it your responsibility?
aren't you her son?
that's strange.
what has mama done for me?
and you tell me. You are my elder brother...
...why didn't you take a stand for me?
why didn't you support me?
mama didn't like Dorice.
so, why didn't you say anything on my behalf?
mama and you threw me out of the house.
that's it.
what else could I do?
throw mama out.
she is stubborn and you are stubborn too.
and I have to suffer.
like I have to suffer the consequences.
don't I want to achieve great feats?
the big director.
brother, is this why you called me here?
I have left my work to come here!
and you will always be a loser.
till today you could never do anything for yourself...
...and you can never do anything either.
you want money, don't you?
tell me if you want some money for mama.
I will send a nurse, I will send some money!
just tell me.
you just wasted my time by calling me here.
listen.
I don't want your money.
I don't want your favour either.
I am telling you this, because...
...after me, mama will become very lonely.
I won't live much longer to be with mama.
and she can't live alone in this flat.
do you understand what I am saying?
if you don't, then think about it and try to understand it.
I won't live much longer to take care of mama.
but no one in our family history...
did you take a second opinion?
it has happened, Vivek.
but are you sure, only two months?
let it be, two months. 21/2 months.
what difference does it make?
the point is I don't have much time.
and, irrespective of whatever happens to me...
...what will we do with mama?
you know, only you can handle her insanity other than me.
mama is...
does she still struggle with the T. V remote?
everyday.
she can never recognise any button except for that of the shirt.
whether it is the remote button, the phone button...
...or the lift button.
you remember, when she took us...
...to papa's office for the first time.
Maalamaal Towers, 19th floor. - Yes!
and, as soon as she entered the lift...
...she pressed four buttons consecutively.
the lift stopped working.
and after that, she pressed the fire alarm too.
that was the most embarrassing day of papa's career.
and the fire brigade arrived in 10 minutes...
...and you were crying away like a girl.
but, I was just seven years old brother.
but I remember, you held my hand and said...
...don't worry, I am there.
I will not let anything happen to you.
how old were you?
is your mathematics weak?
I was 11 years old. - 11!
no, I won't let you die.
I won't let you die, brother.
you won't die brother.
I won't let you die, brother.
mama, what is he doing?
lie down quietly.
who says you have stomach cancer.
that fake doctor and you know nothing.
baba, please carry on.
he is a very learned sage.
Nirmala, your aunt.
he has cured her.
mama, aunt Nirmala had gastritis and not stomach cancer.
and, what do you have?
keep quiet.
she was so scared before coming here.
and now, she plays tennis.
mama...
stop it now, mama.
all this is of no use.
nothing is wrong with you, understood.
we have already faced the biggest bad luck of our life 20 years ago.
when your father passed away.
bad fate doesn't follow all along.
understood that.
and that too, because some fake doctor has said it.
listen to what your mama is saying.
nothing has happened to you?
come on, change your clothes.
come with me.
where?
there is a witch doctor in Vashi.
who conducts by-pass surgery with his fingers.
fingers...
I told you, nothing is wrong with you.
look, take a look at him.
can anyone say that anything is wrong with him.
mama, I... - Amar!
get up, son.
listen. We will use the lift.
there is no time to waste.
look at your hand.
is it Raksha Bandhan ?
yes sir.
I have made bonds with many witch doctors.
look, this red one... Swami Vibhuti Prasad.
this, the Nagadewale Baba , Aatish.
this is the witch doctor Trimbakeshwar Maharaj ...
no, he had given this ring.
I don't know, sir.
one life, so many baba's!
but, since when did you become so superstitious?
not me, sir, my mother.
and she is not this superstitious she just recently became one
Why?
any problem in life?
yes sir, life is my problem.
that's why, I came to learn guitar from you at this age.
in Muqaddar Ka Sikander, he went with a smile.
I want to go playing.
mother!
my mother!
dear mother... mama.
mother!
my mother!
dear mother... mama.
fate will change.
the bonds of sorrow will break.
even Gods yearn for you.
you are full of blessings.
my mother! My mother!
dear mother... mama.
mother!
my mother!
dear mother... mama.
we will be fortunate again.
life will be filled with joys again.
with you, I am not afraid.
you are full of blessings.
my mother! My mother!
dear mother... mama.
mother!
my mother!
dear mother... mama.
very nice.
how did you like it, mama? - What?
my song, my first performance.
I didn't hear it.
this useless, Vivek.
he forgot to bring the battery.
Vivek. - Brother, why are you telling me?
I asked you to get the battery.
I will have to do everything.
mama, give that to me.
here.
put on.
I am the most innocent.
I am your dear son.
I am the most innocent.
I am your dear son.
life is very complicated, mother.
you are Amar's entire world.
your scolding seems so nice.
whenever you catch my ears, it hurts, my mother.
my mother! My mother!
dear mother... mama.
mother!
my Mother!
dear mother... mama.
mama, where are you going?
that... he has come, I am going there.
who, the one at Vashi or at Virar?
he is a Godly man.
go up, he is all alone.
brother!
brother!
I am here.
where did mama go?
she has gone to meet an electrician.
do you know what this electrician does?
he mixes many herbs... what is the frogs younger one called?
tadpole. - Tadpole.
he thrusts it inside the tadpole's mouth... all the herbs.
and after that, he thrusts the tadpole in the patients' mouth.
and after that, the tadpole...
...Does a world tour of your entire body...
...Destroys all your ailments.
even cancer.
can you believe this?
come on, come inside and lie down.
I am fine, Gopi.
I like it here.
you know, in the beginning when I bought this flat...
...it was because of this view.
and I thought that, everyday after arriving from the office...
...I will sit here comfortably and have coffee.
and how many times did I do that?
not even once.
I would come here only to dry my towel.
and I would see only the stain on the towel...
...and nothing else.
and now.
and now, I sit here as long as I can.
for hours.
see that fountain.
it opens up every evening at 5 o'clock.
and at the same time...
...Children come there to play football on the ground.
and that basketball court.
only on weekends they play basketball there.
other times, they use it for skating.
and also fight sometimes.
same like you.
life is so beautiful, isn't it Gopi?
Rajiv, this is for you.
Amar left it for you.
for me.
you remember, he would always complain...
...that no one ever gifts him anything.
but he made sure that he left gifts for everyone.
everyone. Wow.
for his music teacher Savio he has left an honorarium, his car.
he gave him his car.
and the girl, Garima who sold him the car...
...he has given him his house on rent.
really.
you were giving something to Neha.
his childhood memories! Photo album.
and for his boss Das Gupta, he has left behind his guitar.
by the way, this is not for me.
this is for a lady called...
I am just the courier boy.
he must have made a list. What to gift someone.
he had made a list.
his last list.
things to do.
new car. Foreign trip. Neha.
guitar. Boss's boss. Mama.
Rajiv Jhulka. Love. Photo on front page.
not bad, 9 out of 10!
10 out of 10!
just a minute.
look... he had already arranged for this.
No!
do you have pen? - Yes.
10 out of 10!
on 3rd page, isn't it?
can I keep this list? - Yes.
what are the 10 things I want to do before I die?
firstly, your family... leave them happy.
leave them comforts and securities...
...so that they don't have to face problems after you.
firstly, I wish that... I want this to happen.
that, there should be peace in the entire world.
there are no more bombs, people live life peacefully.
whatever I would do, would be very close to...
...what Amar Kaul does, because I figured out that...
...I was going to end my life.
even now, more than anything...
...I would want to set things right.
before I die, I want...
...go to a place where I never went before.
I want to do something beautiful for my parents.
I want to do something for my mummy and papa.
get together with all my friends.
who I have been in touch with ever since I was a child.
one week get together, before I die.
I want to live life.
I want to have kids.
two kids, and... preferably twins.
adopt a girl along with it!
make people laugh.
make my mother very happy.
I am trying to be a very good father.
professor.
thank you.
ls that Neville's handiwork? -Neville's way beyond stick figures.
he's 6 already. -Oh.
no, this masterpiece belongs to my second grandson, David.
God. I can't believe Neville's 6 already.
you won't believe how fast they grow.
I've got Jack Hall on the phone.
they've run the data we've sent them.
here he is.
Jack, were you able to recreate the thermal cycle?
Yes. The storm's rotation is pulling super-cooled air all the way down from the upper troposphere.
but shouldn't the air warm up before it reaches ground level?
it should. But it doesn 't. The air's descending too rapidly.
is this an isolated incident?
I'm afraid not.
we've located two supercells in addition to the one over Scotland.
one over Northern Canada and another one over Siberia.
and do we know their projected paths?
Yes.
our previous estimates of six to eight weeks weren 't even close.
this one storm is going to change the face of our planet.
here's a projection of 24 hours out.
this is 48 hours out.
and in seven to 10 days...
when this storm is over we 'll be in a new ice age.
my God.
Professor...it' s time you got out of there.
I'm afraid that time has come and gone, my friend.
what can we do?
save as many as you can.
Jack...something's happened in New York.
no, the power is out. I've been in here all day.
who needs help? -Here. Over here.
what?
this is the last one. Enjoy it.
greedy.
all circuits are busy at this time.
listen, thanks for coming back for me.
it was really brave.
I guess I better return her bag.
Sam?
just tell her how you feel.
Yeah.
did you reach your little brother yet? -No, there's still no service.
damn cell phones.
excuse me. Are there any pay phones on the upper floors?
no, no, no.
there are some on the mezzanine. -Great.
but I think it's underwater. -Where you going? Power's out.
older payphones draw power directly from the line.
there will be an emergency meeting of all NOAA department heads...
Oh, God. I've been trying to reach Sam.
so have l.
I tried to call and couldn't get you.
it's been a madhouse here. Come on.
are you sure about this?
it works.
I love that picture.
Yeah, so do l.
where was that taken?
Miami.
well, where was l? I don't remember that trip.
Sam and I went with my sister. You were in Alaska doing research on your doctorate.
remember what he was like when he was that age?
everything was "one more.
one more bedtime story. One more ride on my shoulders. "One more, Daddy.
Jack. Sam's on the phone. Line four.
Sam? -Dad!
where are you? Are you all right? -I'm all right. We're at the Public Library.
Sam, it's Mom. I'm so happy you're okay. -Mom.
can you call Laura and Brian's parents and tell them we're all right?
Yes, of course.
Sam, what's that noise? -Sam?
Sam?
what is going on out there, Dad?
Sam. Sam, listen to me.
listen very carefully.
forget what I said about heading south.
it's too late. The storm is gonna get worse.
it's gonna turn into a massive blizzard with an eye in the center, like a huge hurricane.
only the air will be so cold, you could freeze to death in seconds.
Sam?
well, what should we do? -Listen to me, son.
do not go outside.
burn what you can to stay warm, and try to wait it out.
I will come for you. Do you understand me? I will come for you.
Sam?
Sam, come back! -Sam?
Sam, did you hear me?
did you hear me?
Sam?
tell me he's gonna be okay-- -He's gonna be all right.
he's gonna be all right, you understand?
I thought you'd drowned.
let's find some dry clothes for you. Come on.
Where'd you store the arctic gear?
you can't make it to New York, Jack.
I've walked that far before in the snow.
this is not the same.
Jack, this is not the same. Lucy, tell him.
I have to do this.
I know.
my hands are shak
shaking. -That's okay. Here.
here. Come here.
what are you doing?
I'm using my body heat to warm you.
if we let the blood from your arms and legs rush back to your heart too quickly your heart could fail.
where did you learn that?
some of us were actually paying attention in health class.
how are you feeling?
much better.
Frank told me about Sam.
I'm not gonna try to talk you out of going, but there's something I need first.
you have to explain your results to the Administration.
I already tried that, Tom. -I know. It'll be different.
you're gonna brief the president directly.
ls that the last of it? -Pretty much.
okay.
we also found this radio, but I don't think it works.
let me see it.
buddha, keep quiet.
you ain't even supposed to be in here anyway.
come on, guys.
Oh, my God.
the basic rule of storms is they continue until the imbalance that created them is corrected.
in this case, we're talking about a global realignment.
this superstorm will last seven to 10 days.
when it's over, ice and snow will cover the entire Northern Hemisphere.
the ice and snow will reflect sunlight.
the Earth's atmosphere will restabilize with an average temperature close to that of the last lce Age.
well, what can we do about this?
head as far south as possible.
that is not amusing, professor.
where do you suggest they go?
the farther south they go, the safer they'll be.
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't flooded. Mexico would be best.
Mexico? Maybe you should stick to science and leave policy to us.
well, we tried that approach.
you didn't want to hear about the science when it could have made a difference.
what exactly are you proposing, professor?
evacuate everyone south of that line.
what about the people in the North?
I'm afraid it's too late for them.
if they go outside...the storm will kill them.
at this point their best chance is to stay inside.
try to ride it out.
pray.
what do you think he'll do?
I don't know.
Jack...thanks and good luck.
you too.
we're all gonna need it.
we can't evacuate half the country because one scientist thinks the climate is shifting.
every minute we delay costs lives. -What about the other half of the country?
if Professor Hall is right about this storm sending troops north will create more victims.
we need to save the people we can right now.
we take the same approach in triage on the battlefield.
sometimes it's necessary to make difficult choices
I don't accept abandoning half the country as necessary.
maybe if you listened sooner, it wouldn't be.
bullshit. It's easy for him to suggest this plan.
he's safely here in Washington. -His son is in Manhattan.
I thought you should know before you start questioning his motives.
we're going to follow Hall's plan.
general. -Sir?
give the order for the National Guard to evacuate Southern states.
Yes, sir.
Vivian, get me my wife.
sorry, mates, but we're just about out of petrol.
Hey.
is there any chance that it'll run on this?
are you mad?
that's a 12-year-old Scotch.
gentlemen.
to England.
to mankind.
to Manchester United.
I just...I just wish I could have seen him grow up. You know?
the important thing is he will grow up.
Amen.
maybe you should have somebody help you with that.
sir, I am president of the Electronics Club, the Math Club and the Chess Club.
now, if there's a bigger nerd in here, please, point him out.
I'll just leave you alone to work on it, okay?
come on, Buddha, come on. Do your business.
look, there's nobody around.
you know what? I'll turn around. I won't look. I promise.
what?
Hey, man, there's people out there.
I was walking my dog.
there's hundreds of them. They're walking on the snow.
where they all going?
they're getting out of the city before it's too late.
all right, everybody. Quiet down.
when was the last time anyone got a signal on a cell phone?
I got through to my cousin in Memphis an hour ago.
they're being evacuated to the South.
we should get moving too.
the water is frozen over enough to walk on.
we should get going before the snow gets too deep.
everyone, wrap yourselves up as fast as you can.
we shouldn't go.
why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.
when I talked to my dad, he told me to stay inside.
the storm will kill anybody in it.
then you have to say something. -I know.
excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.
what? Listen, we're all scared, but we've got no choice.
that's not it. -Get ready to go.
if these people go outside, they will freeze to death!
okay, what is this nonsense?
it's not nonsense. All right? Look, this storm is gonna get worse.
the people caught outside will freeze to death.
where are you getting this? -My dad's a climatologist.
he works for the government. -So what do we do?
we stay inside, we keep warm, and we wait it out.
the snow is getting deeper by the minute.
we'd be trapped here without food, supplies...
it's a risk, yeah-- -An unnecessary risk.
no, no. It's not.
we've wasted enough time talking. Come on.
let's go.
look, look. Just look for a second. -Come on, everybody
this storm is gonna get bad. It's gonna get really, really bad.
you're not gonna be able to survive it.
believe me.
sir, please just stay. Just stay.
just don't...
she's set to go. -Come on, straight to the back, guys.
it'll be impossible to reach each other.
leave a message for me at the embassy in Mexico City.
okay, I will.
I love you.
I love you, Jack.
tell Sam I love him so much.
God be with you.
doctor Hall? -Yeah.
we haven't been able to reach Peter's parents.
I'm gonna try later, okay? -Okay. Thank you.
I got it.
you're supposed to be on a bus heading south.
I've been watching your back for 20 years. You think I'd let you go alone?
and all these years I thought I was watching your back.
where are the keys?
in the truck.
where do you think you're going?
neither one of you can navigate worth a damn.
without me, you'll end up in Cleveland.
I'll try to give you updates on the storm as it heads your way.
good luck, Jack.
breaking news from the U. S.-Mexico border.
just half an hour ago, Mexican officials closed the border in the light of so many U. S. refugees who are fleeing south in the wake of the approaching storm.
these people came in anticipation of crossing into Mexico.
instead, they've been met with closed gates.
and now, in a dramatic reversal of illegal immigration...thousands of people are crossing the Rio Grande into Mexico.
the scene unfolding here behind me is one of desperation and frustration.
people have abandoned their cars, grabbed their belongings and they are wading across the river illegally into Mexico.
here it is.
this fireplace probably hasn't been used in about 1 00 years.
all right.
what are you doing? -What did you think we would burn?
you can't burn books. -No, absolutely not.
you want to freeze to death?
I'll go get some more.
I'll help you.
I'm going with them.
okay, do you have a cafeteria or a lunchroom?
just an employees' lounge with a few vending machines.
we're not gonna last long on M&M's and potato chips.
what about the garbage cans?
there's always something to eat in the garbage.
friedrich Nietzsche? We can't burn Nietzsche.
he was the most important thinker of the 19th century.
please. He was a chauvinist pig in love with his sister.
he was not a chauvinist pig.
but he was in love with his sister.
excuse me? You guys?
Yeah, there's a whole section on tax law down here that we can burn.
after hours of uncertainty, the traffic is now moving smoothly from the United States into Mexico.
this is only possible because the president was able to negotiate a deal to forgive all Latin American debt in exchange for opening the border.
now, multitudes of American families are feeling a rush of relief...
Lucy?
is Peter's ambulance here?
no.
Why? -They've all gone.
what? -ln the confusion I don't know what happened. People started to panic, and they left
God. -There's a policeman with a snowplow.
he's waiting outside. -God.
Peter can't be moved in anything but an ambulance.
I called and left a message for the county ambulance service.
okay.
okay, you should go, and I'll stay and wait.
Lucy, no.
no. -No, you should go.
he's not gonna wait forever.
it's okay.
I'm sorry.
it's okay. -All right.
you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just-- I cut my leg the other day.
did you get a signal?
Yeah, for a minute.
And?
man, this storm is everywhere.
it's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.
europe is buried under 1 5 feet of snow and they say it's gonna get just as bad here.
I mean, I don't think your dad's gonna make it.
no, he'll make it.
he'll make it.
the White House has ordered a national disaster alert for all Northern states.
continued exposure to the approaching storm is deadly.
remain indoors and take all measures to stay warm, burning any fuel sources...until the storm is over. Roads are impassable across New York State as far south as Pennsylvania
where are we?
looks like we' re just north of Philadelphia.
look out!
you guys okay?
Yeah. -Yeah.
once again, roads across the... -Sorry, boss.
unpack the snowshoes.
we're walking from here.
come on, ma'am. Let's get up and get going.
we've only made it to Brooklyn. Maybe we should just turn back.
Why? Half the city's frozen under water. There's nothing to go back to.
time to get up and keep moving.
what we should've done is stayed in the library.
okay, guys, let's get moving.
wake up.
what are you doing?
insulating.
newspaper's best, but this'll do.
you know, you spend some years on the streets and you learn how to keep warm.
Hey.
Thanks.
I got one.
your favorite vacation.
besides this one?
all right.
I went to Greenland with my dad on one of his research trips a few years ago...
...and the ship broke down, and we got stuck.
and it rained constantly.
that sounds really boring.
but actually really nice, you know?
just me and my dad hanging out for 10 days.
Frank!
are you all right?
I'm fine.
I just dropped in to do a little shopping.
I gotta lose this sled.
hold on! We'll pull you up.
Jason! You've got to support Frank's weight.
okay, I'll try.
okay, I think I have his weight now.
I'm coming to you.
the glass is breaking!
too much weight.
it's not gonna hold.
no. No.
Frank. I can get you out.
don't do it!
no, Frank, no! -Frank, no!
Frank!
what have you got there?
a Gutenberg Bible.
it was in the rare books room.
you think God's gonna save you?
no. I don't believe in God.
you're holding onto that Bible pretty tight.
I'm protecting it.
this Bible is the first book ever printed.
it represents the dawn of the age of reason.
as far as I'm concerned, the written word is mankind's greatest achievement.
you can laugh.
but if Western civilization is finished...
...I'm gonna save at least one little piece of it.
we heard somebody was left behind.
we brought an ambulance. -Thank God.
thank you so much for coming.
Hey.
Hey, are you all right?
you look like you have a fever or something.
I'm fine. I just can't sleep.
my mind keeps going over all those worthless decathlon facts.
it's pretty stupid, huh? -No, it's all right.
I guess you just haven't had time to adjust yet.
how am I supposed to adjust, Sam?
everything I've ever cared about, everything I've worked for has all been preparation for a future that no longer exists.
I know you always thought I took the competition too seriously.
you were right.
lt was all for nothing. -No, no. I
no, I just-- I just said that to avoid admitting the truth.
truth about what?
about why I joined the team.
I joined it because of you.
Hey.
I know.
I know.
Mr. President. -All right.
I'm sorry, sir, we can't wait any longer.
we're the last ones.
all right.
Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.
we've got an urgent message for high command.
request priority for landing zone one.
Roger that, Delta 26. Transport will be waiting.
sir. -Thank you, corporal.
sorry for the delay, sir. -Carry on.
madam Secretary.
Raymond.
the president's motorcade got caught in the storm.
they didn't make it.
and she wouldn't wake up this morning. I
she only had a fever. I don't understand.
she's awfully pale.
none of us has had anything real to eat in days.
it's hypothermia. -But how can it be hypothermia?
we've all been in-- -Maybe it's the flu.
no, no, it's not the flu.
and how do you know?
books can be good for things other than burning. What are her symptoms?
I told you that she has a fever and her-- She's got a really cold sweat.
how's her pulse?
it's really fast. -Does she have any injuries?
like a cut that might have gotten infected?
she was complaining about a cut on her leg a few days ago.
I didn't think anything of it.
Oh, my gosh.
that's blood poisoning. Septicemia.
she could go into septic shock.
I've seen that before. That can get bad.
she needs a massive dose of penicillin...or a broad-spectrum antibiotic immediately, or...
or what?
I've never seen anything like it.
there's no point of reference. All I can see is cloud cover.
what are you doing?
taking infrared image of thermal currents.
send to Houston, Korolev, your weather service.
I'll help you.
Tom? Tom, wake up.
I just received some satellite images from the space station. You better take a look.
how big is this thing?
the vortex is 50 miles in diameter.
and growing. The two cells over Europe and Asia are even bigger.
good God.
this one's gonna hit New York inside an hour.
Jason!
are you all right?
Jason!
what are you doing? -There's gotta be medicine on that ship.
I thought you said it was too dangerous to go outside.
I know I did.
where did you find those chairs?
Why?
I'm going with you.
me too.
come on, damn it!
it's all in Russian. I-- -I know.
Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it. -What? How do you know?
because it says "penicillin" on the bottle.
Hey, wait. This is the mess hall.
we should find some food. -We don't have time.
listen, none of us are gonna survive much longer without food. Including Laura.
okay.
Sam, over here. -What?
bingo.
Brian?
I'm okay. -What happened?
all I did was open up the cupboard.
well, we can use it. -Put food in it.
pull him in, Brian!
you all right? -Oh, my God, there's more.
my leg.
here, use this.
it should be over New York by now.
satellite readings are showing a temperature drop of 10 degrees per second.
you guys, I think we're in the eye of it.
we gotta get back right now.
look, I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna lure the wolves out of the room.
when they leave, you lock the door.
good luck.
Brian, hurry. -I need something.
come on, hurry!
Brian! Brian, open the door!
we have to get out of here now.
Brian, get the supplies.
Oh, shit. Let's go!
pull, Brian!
take the medicine to Laura.
we're almost there. Come on!
Brian! Close the door!
don't let the fire go out!
what's happening?
buddha, come away from the door.
come, Buddha, come!
more books! More books!
how long have I been out of it?
couple hours.
how do you feel?
okay. What happened?
well, we had to get inside in kind of a hurry, so I sort of pushed you in.
I should be used to you pushing me around.
good to have you back.
what are you doing?
the eye of the storm has passed, and we're 40 miles from Manhattan.
shouldn't we wait one more day?
Sam may not have one more day.
what do you think's gonna happen to us?
what do you mean?
I mean us. Civilization. Everybody.
mankind survived the last lce Age.
we're certainly capable of surviving this one.
all depends on whether or not we're able to learn from our mistakes.
I sure as hell would like a chance to learn from mine.
you did everything you could.
I was thinking about Sam.
Jack, you know the chances of Sam...
I made my son a promise.
I'm going to keep it.
Parker, this is Houston. Do you read?
Roger, mission control. Go ahead.
we've got scattered reports that the storm is dissipating over North America.
can you confirm?
affirmative. It's finally clearing.
we're over Europe right now.
I can see landmass for the first time in days.
how much further is it to the library?
it should be...right here.
I'm sorry, Jack.
Sam?
who is that?
my father.
you made it.
of course I did.
embassy OF THE UNlTED STATES OF AMERlCA
Mr. President.
I've just received a shortwave radio transmission from Jack Hall.
he made it to New York.
he says there are survivors.
thank you, Tom.
that's...that's good news.
these past few weeks have left us all with a profound sense of humility in the face of nature's destructive power.
for years, we operated under the belief that we could continue consuming our planet's natural resources without consequence.
we were wrong.
I was wrong.
the fact that my first address to you comes from a consulate on foreign soil is a testament to our changed reality.
not only Americans but people all around the globe are now guests in the nations we once called The Third World.
in our time of need, they have taken us in and sheltered us.
and I am deeply grateful for their hospitality.
we mourn the loss of a spirited leader whose courageous order to evacuate...
Peter? Hey, you feeling okay today?
for days, we 've despaired about the fate of the people who are trapped in the North.
today, there is cause for hope.
only a few hours ago, I received word that a small group of people survived in New York City against all odds and in the face of tremendous adversity.
I've ordered an immediate search-and-rescue mission to bring them home and to look for more survivors.
Jack!
it' s good to see you. Come on, let' s go get on board.
look at that.
what?
have you ever seen the air so clear?
the Boston Film Festival.
I mean hoping that you still produce again.
I don't think I can't.
maybe it's time for a little impulsive behaviour for change Dawson.
one minute you're laughing and next you're in tears!
I'm fine Jack.
maybe it's time you went back to your medication.
my mother and my sister they depend on me, to be the rock, ME.
I understand, it's just... I wish let me help you.
I can't believe you're saying this.
I mean, after all these years of hiding behind high-brow analytical posturing.
I'm saying it. I love you. I know it's nonsensical.
Nonsensical? It's insane.
we've known each other for 15 years and you couldn't find another time to freudian-slip this cat out of the bag?!
I've wanted to! So many times. You have no idea how long I've been wrestling...
internally with the psychological repercussions of my feelings.
I need time to process this.
I mean, my electrical synapses are on overload here.
my brain is telling me one thing but my heart, it says another.
it's telling me that I should consider the unequivical, highly irrational, possibly damaging, proposition...
of loving you back.
wait.
you missed a line. You forgot 'hypnotically scarred'.
so if you want it done right, then you get an actor.
I'm not exactly comfortable playing the girl here.
so what do you think? Think it would make a good movie?
you're writing too many syllables.
I mean, what's with all the psychobabble insight?
how many teenagers do you know that talk like that?
Grumbles, aside, do you think it would make a good movie?
yeah...
yeah...
however, you did make Joey a little on the angry side, even for her.
it's not Joey.
right. That's not Joey, the guy's not you, and you're not disecting you two's relationship on the page just like every other narcissistic writer through history.
just tell me what you think.
I think it's dark. It's obtuse. It's very un-Dawson Leery.
thank you.
this is the first time I've been able to write something that's not just plot-driven but emotionally driven.
Congratulations. Revolving as an artist.
it's about time I took some risks, you know? Ride the edge a little.
well, if that's the case, I do have one note.
which is?
I mean, why don't they have sex?
I know you and Joey never did in real life but this is a film.
you can write it any way you want. You know? Take the risky plunge.
Ah-ha! See, I have.
how many movies have you seen where a bunch of horny teenagers just...
go at it like rabbits?
I mean, that's the safe choice.
the riskier, edgier choice is to have them not do it.
only you take your virginal insecurities and fear of deflowerment and turn them into "risky, edgy behavior.
Oh yeah, I have no problem being a virgin, alright?
I'm sorry if my confidence in my convictions is discombobulates you.
Dis-com-bob-u-late. How many syllables is that?
Hey. We're holding auditions for a movie today. Hope you can make it.
Hey!
Hey, you!
so how's interest? Are we going to have a turnout?
um, as a first-time producer...
my instincts tell me that we're going to have a huge turn-out, Dawson.
Hey, we're having auditions for a movie today. Come on by, alright?
you're such a natural. You're so good at this.
well, thanks. Don't expect too much. I mean, I'm no Joey.
well, hey, she had no experience either when she first started.
you're going to be good. I have the up-most confidence in you.
well, thank you. Mr. WriterDirector.
Hey, be sure to give a flier to James Lowing, he'd be perfect for the lead.
EW. - Ew? Jen, he's like the classic, leading guy. He's kind, he's funny...
he's self-effacing, he's Jimmy Stewart meets Tom Hanks.
Yeah, and about as sexy as a bucket, Dawson. - Alright.
now, Dave Fachelli, that's the leading man. - Excuse me?
Yeah, he's like dark and brooding and Ray Liotta...
sewer rat. I don't get it...no way.
I'm just saying he's got a certain...appeal.
so?
I mean, people don't always go to the movies to see their kind, sweet next-door neighbor.
they go to see that slightly dangerous guy that they desperately want to sleep with but never will in real life.
sexy will always win out over nice.
I'm just saying everyone casts Tom Hanks, you know?
try and make the less obvious choice.
Hey, movie auditions today.
Hey! What's this?
the results of Pacey Witter's HIV test.
you got tested?
you told me to.
but you argued with me.
Andie, I always argue with you. It doesn't mean I don't listen.
and...?
and it's negative! Which is positive in my book.
Congratulations. I'm proud of you. Getting tested was...
very responsible of you.
just don't think that now that we got tested we're going to...
you know.- What? - You know...
no, I have no idea what you're talking about.
okay, uhm, you know, we haven't been very, uhm, physical, or anything and I'm not opposed to us becoming more...
intimate, but I just want you to know that everything has a perfect place and time.
I didn't get tested to engage in uninhibited scrumping with you.
I got tested for me. I don't want to jump in the sack with you.
Oh. Why not, exactly? Do you not find me attractive?
of course I find you attractive, Andie.
but you don't want to?
do you want to?
well, I asked you.
well, I'm asking you back.
you first.
I'd like to scrump with you any day of the week, okay?
but we've got all the time in the world. There's no need to rush anything.
okay, I hear you and I concur.
good. - Good...
but if it were the right time and place, you would want to, right?
Oh, hell yes!
OK, good. 'Til then. - Until.
Hey. - Hey.
movie auditions. Art class.
I see you've graduated from fruit bowls.
we're doing life-sketching...nude models...so.
we're supposed to see the human form, a mass of lines and shadows.
Really?
I'm working on it.
and he does poses for you?
Yeah.
don't you find that uncomfortable?
just sitting in a room with some guy completely in the buff right in front of you?
no...
does he like talk or anything?
Oh, yeah. He sings, tells jokes, does a little softshoe.
no, he doesn't talk, Dawson. He's a model. He sits there.
he just takes breaks every now and then.
and Little Joey Potter doesn't blush?
no.
not even a little?
maybe a little...
just a little?
okay, I've broken 12 pencils.
but it's getting better. You'd be surprised, Dawson.
I'm changing. I'm not Little Joey Potter anymore.
no, you're certainly not.
auditions... come please...
Jen's your producer?
Yeah...yeah, you're busy.
so what's your movie about?
um, young boy...comes of age...in a small town...
well, good luck with it, Dawson.
thank you, thank you! Gotta go! Time is money.
Hey! Are you going to audition for Dawson's movie?
participate in Dawson Leery's lame home video project?
doubtful. Why? Are you?
I was thinking about it.
I got the audition piece so I was looking through it.
he's got financing. He's going to do the festival circuit.
it would be an opportunity for some Hollywood-type exposure.
Yeah, right! Are you have delusions of Brad Pitt-itis?
I think I would make a good actor, actually.
and actors get action, and I foresee a non-stop party.
I was thinking maybe you and I could read together.
you and me?
Yeah, c'mon! We'd have some serious chemistry.
come on. Audition with me.
celebrate elsewhere. I couldn't be less interested.
don't look.
come on, I've seen a naked guy before, Joey.
Yeah, but not drawn with the talent of a second grader, trust me.
C'mon. Let me see it! Let me see it! - Nooo.
Wow. It's a good use of light and dark, especially around the side.
I mean, it's very dramatic. Shading is excellent.
Really?
Yeah. Lines are strong. Uh, everything seems to be in...
proportion. Uh, you did a real nice job - Joey! Oh God! I'm sorry, Joey! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.
I gotta go.
I can't believe you're saying this.
after all these years of high brow, analytical posturing.
I love you...I know it's nonsensical.
Nonsensical? It's insane! We've known each other for 15 years.
somewhere in there you couldn't find the time to - I've wanted to. So many times.
but you have no idea how long I've wrestled internally with the psychological repercussions...
you have no idea how long I've been wrestling internally with the psychological reproductions.
but my heart says something different.
that I should consider the unequivical, possibly damaging highly irritional, hypnotically scarring, proposition of loving you back.
cool.
listen, I'm sorry. Uh, can you save it?
Oh, God. I'm sorry. Look, can I do anything? What?
there's nothing you can do, Jack. It's due Thursday.
I'm already the youngest and least experienced in the class and now I'm going to show up with an incomplete assignment.
can you redraw it?
not from memory. I mean, this is a nude man, Jack.
I can't just recall it from thin air.
the pose, the composition, the light, the shadows.
you can't just recreate that.
um , let me pose for ya. - What?
Yeah, no, I'm serious. Let me pose for you. No big deal.
you want to pose for me... naked.
uh huh... yeah.
let me think about that...uh, no.
okay, uh, what happens if you don't turn it in?
look, I get an F, not to mention embarressment and feelings of tremendous inadequacy.
alright, then that's it, I'll pose it for you.
no, you're not.
fraid about seeing me naked?
Ah, the "Joey's a prude" tactic. Clever, but wrong.
alright, then what is it? Are you scared it might get sexual or something?
believe it or not, Jack, not every moment with you is sexually charged. Sorry.
well, then, there should be no problem.
C'mon, I feel awful about this and
I don't want you to fail your first art project because of me so let me help you.
you're serious, aren't you?
I'm dead serious. I have a huge deal about things like this. So don't feel weird, I don't.
I don't know, Jack. I don't know if this is a good thing for us.
strictly professional, okay? C'mon, Joey. This is your art.
well, I guess the male form is just the male form...
good, it's settled. I'll come by your house tomorrow around 7... Yeah...
there ya go, Miss.
thank you.
be careful with the dosage, I put a pamphlet in there for you.
I'm familiar with the drug, thank you.
Hello, McPhee, what's shakin'?
Hey, Pacey! Hi...
whatcha got in the bag?
Uh.nothing.
pacey, please. Give it back.
andrea McPhee, take two tablets a day, as directed. Xanax, 20mg.
xanax, um, that's for severe depression and anxiety, right?
it's like Prozac so...
uh, it's my mom's. We have the same first name. Andrea.
yeah... yeah... - Please, Pacey, she's getting better.
I'm really sorry. I didn't know.
it's okay.
you're such a good daughter.
what are you doin' here?
nothing, um, just picking up some stuff.
in the, uh, condom section?
I had no idea!
how odd. You don't think this is a sign, do you?
like the love gods are trying to help us out...
no, I think that would be you.
I'm just engaging in a little innuendo hoping that someday it will lead to something a little more tangible.
Hey, I'm all for discovery the...
physical side of Pacey Witter, I just don't know that I'm entirely prepared yet.
well, hey , be prepared.
Hey. Designed for that woman's extra pleasure. Yeah...how would they know?
maybe they're designed by women.
Oh. Good point. So, uh, should we get some?
what?
well, you're right. We should be prepared.
in case that mood strikes and we'll be ready.
are you being serious?
Yeah, we might as well have them on stand by.
I mean, we can be adults about this.
you're serious.
isn't there anyone else I can read with?
Abby, we're short on time. If you could just start on page 3, that'd be great.
sure, Dawson, but can I just ask a quick question?
what is it, Chris?
I just...I don't understand why they don't ever do it.
I mean, you have all the hot foreplay stuff, but they never hook up.
right. Well, your character believes that sometimes true love goes behind that that's merely physical.
see, yeah, that's just the part I don't get.
Yeah, Dawson, I think you should rethink that part. It's a little petty.
okay, you know what, guys? Why don't we just keep moving?
I've wanted to. So many times. You have no idea how long
I've wrestled with the psychological repercussions of my feelings.
I need some time to process here. My electrocal synapses are on overload.
my brain says one thing but my heart says something else.
that I should consider the unequivical, possibly damaging, highly irrational, hypnotically scarring, proposition of loving you back.
wait.
what the hell was that you loveneck freak?!
a kiss. It was in the script.
that was your tongue in my mouth.
sorry, I was just getting into the role.
you were trying to get into my pants. God, I'm going to be sick.
shall I continue?
that'll be all, thank you.
I've put lots of fantasy thought into this, and I want my first time to be special.
you know, the perfect evening.
like, dinner at a French restaurant, a romantic after-dinner stroll by the dock, and then onto a nice historic bed and breakfast.
a bed and breakfast?
it's my fantasy, go with it. Lavender candles...
and, uh, Sinatra, or somebody equally as old-style and romantic.
OK. Schedule in bathroom breaks, or does the poor guy have to hold it all evening?
OK, I'm sorry, but deciding to lose my virginity is a huge deal, ok?
I mean, I didn't hold onto it for 16 years just to lose it in one drunk fleeting moment in some skanky back seat of a late model american car, ok?
Damn! Somebody's leaking all my best lovemaking secrets.
it's just that... I'm going to remember this for the rest of my life, and I just think that if we put a little planning into it, to ensure that it's worth remembering, it would be really nice.
I know how important the first time is. Believe me, of all people, I know.
and I know with my tainted past, I might not be the most likely of candidates, but if and when you do decide it's the right time for you,
I'd really like to be the one that helps to make it a memorable evening.
well, when you talk like that, it makes me want to jump you.
Oh, really?
Yes.
it's just so frustrating to have this dream of making this movie, and actually get the money to make the movie, and then realizing that it still might not happen.
just like in the script.
what do you mean?
I mean, you and Joey. You're in love with her for 15 years, and then when you're just about to have her, you lose her. Tragic.
the script is not about Joey.
Dawson, give me a break. It reads like an autobiography.
it's funny. I thought that...
we had something, too, but...
even with my flair for the dramatic, my role has been reduced to the first act.
Jen, you were important to me. You know that.
was I?
Absolutely. More than you know.
then I, I want to ask you something, Dawson. Since we're friends and all, um...
what did you like about me?
what did I like about you? We have fun together...
you know... I mean, you...
you open me up to stuff. Skinny-dipping didn't suck. You know, you were...
you were sexy.
were? - Are. Are.
you know, I think that Chris and Abby are right about your script.
I think that the 2 young lovers should do it.
it's about romance, not sex.
who says that sex can't be romantic, Dawson? Come on.
I mean, look at your target audience.
I wanted to make the less obvious choice.
that's funny when you think about it.
what?
just that, if you hadn't gone for such an obvious choice of girl, maybe the ending to your script would have been a little less obvious.
I'm coming out. Um...
Jack McPhee reporting for duty.
Where--where do you want me?
um, you could, uh, sit on the couch or, or the chair.
or you could stand, or I could move.
uh, why don't I just take the couch? - Ok.
you know, Joey, if--if you're uncomfortable at all,
I--I can, you know, keep the towel on for a while,
just until we get loosened up. You know, you can kind of sketch around... it.
Jack, I'm fine. You know, whatever.
uh, ok.
you know what? You're probably right.
maybe--maybe the towel is a good idea. I mean, it'll give me a chance to concentrate on the...
the top part.
Oh, deja vu. This is just like that scene from Titanic.
Oh, right. Yeah. Except I'm Jack and... you're Rose.
role reversal. I like it.
look, Joey, if you're not gonna make it, we can stop this at any time.
you know, um... maybe if we just didn't talk.
um, the model in class kinda just sat and stared out the window.
and, you know, since we are just... starting to get to know each other, I just...
I'll admit it has made me slightly uncomfortable.
well...
just imagine how comfortable we're gonna be around each other after tonight.
you know, Jack, um... I can't do this.
you know, I just don't think this is a good idea.
I mean, I tried to be adult about this, and not behave like little Joey Potter, but the truth is, you know, I'm really not that experienced with...
um, a lot of things.
and I really don't think I could handle seeing you naked right now, so if you could probably just get dressed and go home, that would...
what about your sketch?
Yeah, I'll figure out some way to fudge it.
are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure!
well, um... might as well stay now.
so, uh...how's it look?
it"? Oh, it's coming along fine. I'm sorry.
and how you doing?
surprisingly well. You know, no sign of heart failure, so...
it's actually...it's ok. It feels kind of...
natural?
Um...sort of. It's more like an accomplishment.
I know, this is something that most people would just assume that Joey could not do.
why is that?
I mean, you see how I live. I don't get out much, and...
I guess my life just seems kind of plain sometimes.
does that bother you?
um...Yeah, sometimes.
a good thing that I've discovered about this whole art thing is that it allows me to take chances, you know? I mean, this here is risky.
art is risky 'cause...you know, every time I draw or paint or take a class,
I just... I feel like I'm doing something special.
you know, just for me. Does that make sense?
it feels dangerous.
Yeah. Yeah. Why is that?
art is about a world of uncertainty, And that makes it scary.
and what scares you? - Sex.
first time anxiety?
Oh, no, no! I'm not a virgin.
Oh. So, um... have you done it a lot?
well, I've done it a total of, uh...once.
all I know is I'm really lucky to have you for a friend.
I never could have gotten through those horrifically epic auditions today.
it's my job.
no, that's above and beyond the call of duty.
you must have heard those lines read so many times you have the whole thing committed to memory.
well, the good thing is, if you get really desperate,
I could always play your leading lady.
maybe you should have.
should have what?
been my leading lady.
you think?
sometimes. Too much of the time.
was it scary?
Yeah.
don't feel bad. I mean, I haven't done it at all, and it terrifies me from afar, so...
you know, it's not just that it was scary.
I mean, that was part of it, but...
I don't know, it's...
it's hard to describe. You know,
I'm not really that good at expressing myself. You know,
I...I guess you found my...social flaw.
could you try?
I know you've got this notion that if you-- if you don't let your characters act on their desires, then you're making a stronger, riskier choice, but that's not real life.
but it's so obvious. I mean that...
the story is much stronger if the characters resist their lust.
but it's not real. True love is always fueled by lust, and people who care that much about each other will sooner or later end up having sex.
even people who don't care that much.
and besides, this is 1998. Sex is always a risky choice.
I just don't happen to believe that it's an obvious one.
I think that intent and motive is what makes sex so interesting, Dawson.
I mean, why do 2 people have sex? Ok, uh, so they're in love.
that's obvious. Who cares?
but they're in lust. Slightly more interesting.
they're hurting over someone. They're in pain. Trying to forget someone.
they're in denial. They're looking for a distraction.
all of a sudden, sex has just become very interesting and not the obvious choice at all.
maybe you should think about a rewrite, Dawson. You've still got time.
Really? You--you want to know?
Yeah. I mean, not the gory details. Just...the feeling of it.
maybe you could describe it as if it were art.
Well...at first, it's all a jumble of emotions.
uh, it's hard to pinpoint.
it's--it's kind of like expressionistic painting.
but, you know, if you get comfortable with it, it's--it's like the first time you see Van Gogh's "Starry night."
it's the same sky you've always seen, but everything...is different.
bigger. More passionate. The blues, the yellows, the swirling stars.
everything has feeling, movement. Even the colors seem alive.
it's like...lying on Monet's water lilies.
it's the warmth of a Georgia o'Keefe flower wrapped around you...
feeling everything so intensely.
it's the power and strength of a Degas dancer, it's the passion of...Munch's "Scream," the
where are we?
just wait.
pacey, you're scaring me. Where have you taken me?
well, we just ate at Petite la Bistro, then we went for a stroll along the docks.
blindfolded, I might add.
so think about it. There's only one place we could be right now, isn't there?
pacey, if I take off this blindfold and we're standing in a bed and breakfast, you're dead.
Well...dispose of my remains now.
Oh, Pacey. God, I don't know whether to be touched or terrified.
Hey, listen, you know, this night was not designed to reach the verdict of doing it.
I just--I wanted to give you your fantasy evening.
you know, a French dinner, a stroll along the docks, a bed and breakfast, romantic music.
we can save doing it for another time.
this is a step-by-step process. For me, too.
what? What's wrong?
I...I really want to do this. I mean...
I'd be lying if I said I didn't. And...
you're really special to me. But, uh,
I... I don't--I don't think I'm ready for this right now.
I mean, there's so much that's going on that you don't know about, and that I can't even begin to tell you, um, I...I can't do this.
I'm sorry, Pacey. - It's okay. - I can't do this.
Why? Don't worry. It's no big deal. I told you.
we can wait. Honestly...
I think I brought you here tonight as much for me as I did for you.
I just wanted to give you your fantasy evening, you know, so...
please don't be upset with me. You have no idea what you've done for me, just being in my life.
I mean, you make me feel like maybe there's hope for my pathetic existence, and I don't have to sleep with you to feel that.
I feel it right now, just holding you in my arms. God, I am so lucky.
you know what, Witter? You make me want to do it.
listen, I'm really sorry.
listen, Jack, it's ok, you know, don't worry about it. Stuff happens.
although not usually that kind of stuff And usually not in the Potter living room.
I didn't think it would be such a big deal for me to pose for you.
Yeah, well...
listen, um... is this gonna screw things up with us?
what do you mean?
well, I mean, I didn't want to bring sex in this evening, you know.
all I wanted to do was help you. uh, I don't want you to think 'cause a...
all this stuff...here we go again. Social flaw.
well, let's be honest with ourselves.
Yes, we both came in here with the noblest of intentions.
but, you know, at the end of the day, we're both human, and...
there's something between us that's...you know, it's a...
is your social flaw contagious?
uh, yeah... God, I was so naive to think that this was a good idea.
no, I take full responsibility for this evening's turn of events.
I mean, it's my fault. I asked to hear it.
that's true. Actually, I think it was your fault.
it's...it's just that, uh... I don't know.
tonight was a big step in the life of little Joey Potter.
she didn't feel so little tonight.
I guess I just tried to bite off a tad too much.
well, you were curious.
Yeah. For all the big words and not wanting to hear the gory details,
I guess I'm just wrestling with my hormones like everyone else.
well, um, you know, if you ever want to, uh, explore your curiosity...
I'm available.
first you're a model, now you're a tour guide.
no. I'm just a guy who...
finds it really hard not to want to hold you, and touch you, and I didn't really realize that until tonight when it was completely forbidden.
you have your clothes on now.
you're saying it's not forbidden?
no. I'm just saying it's, um...it's not as scary.
gee, thanks.
no, you know what I mean.
I think that, uh, 2 scared people...cancel each other out.
Meaning?
meaning that tonight was a night of firsts, and there's no reason that it has to stop.
Dawson? Dawson, what are you doing here?
I've been thinking about what you said about motive and intent.
and love vs. hurt vs. lust vs. distraction.
And?
don't ask my motive.
I know better.
what's wrong?
uh...you're not gonna believe this.
frankly, I don't really believe it, but...
I don't want to do this. Yeah, I said that out loud, right?
you don't want to?
uh, no, no, I do. God, do I, but...
so?
so, for once, Pacey Witter's raging hormones aren't going to do all the talking.
and for once, I'm gonna do the right thing and...
we're not ready for this, Andie.
b-but I might be ready and...
listen, at the risk of sounding like a really cheesy...
after school special, when you're really ready, you'll know, and then we'll do this. Then we'll do this till the cows come home.
but this thing is way too important for me to just fall back on the old "do now, think later" Pacey Witter approach.
you know what the really risky thing for me to do is?
it's to not have sex. I mean, maybe that way I'll have some resemblance of a real relationship.
so...
you take all the time you need, 'cause I'll be here.
there you go again, Pacey. Just making me want to do it even more.
Mmm...it's all part of my evil plan.
Mmm.
come on. I'll drive you home.
it wasn't meant to be this way. You know?
we make our plans, sure.
but life...
life is what happens to you along the way.
you know, at first, I didn't want this.
I didn't want to connect.
I didn't want to get involved.
and she kept on at me.
this is what life is. This is why we're here, to connect.
to build.
we're here to build something.
and then we had Theo.
and then I understood that she was right.
we're not meant to be alone.
you know what she said to me?
she said that even the most damaged heart can be mended.
even the most damaged heart.
Yeah.
no, I'm with Vic.
what?
I can't let you in until Alphonse is home.
Alphonse is on his way.
where?
in the basement.
Oh, Paulie.
no.
it's Paul.
why is the alarm off?
I told you that you should always have it on!
she said that she didn't turn it off.
go.
719, now you realize.
what?
what the fuck? This shit is crazy.
now he's killing us.
call the locksmith.
and get that asshole from the alarm company over here.
now you realize.
I know who's doing this to me.
killed for less.
a little uncouth to come without a call.
there's a better place for you to be.
get out. Go.
am I gonna get paid?
have you seen this man?
Paul? Everyone knows Paul's missing.
I want you to think before you answer.
cause I'm getting to the bottom of this.
the bottom of what?
three months of letters.
three months of torment.
not being able to leave my house without wondering if some coward is gonna sneak up behind me and...
paul was looking into this.
and I think he found exactly what he was looking for.
but before he could come and tell me, my friend Paul shows up strangled in my freezer.
you've got a lot of enemies, don't you, Alphonse?
three months ago you and I had our disagreement!
I raised my take to 25% to allow you to continue to operate in my buildings.
I started getting letters three months ago!
that's no fucking coincidence!
that's not fucking accurate!
you asked for 30%, and Lon told you, you could only ask me for 20%.
so if anyone was bent out of shape, it was fucking you, Alphonse.
who's in this picture?
I don't fucking know. - Who the fuck is in this picture?
I don't know!
what am I supposed to realize?
what does 719 mean? What am I going to fucking realize?
what am I gonna fucking realize?
Darcy - Want to give me a hand here, mate?
he ain't got shit to do with this!
I've been picking up from Harry for over a year.
no. He's a fucking liar so you shut the fuck up.
I'm gonna ask you again. What am I supposed to realize?
I don't care what you think I've done to you, you are not sanctioned to kill me.
that much I do fucking know.
so it's not on, you even coming here!
"not on" ?
the term is, "Not cool."
it's you fucking English. You always do shit like that.
Alphonse, just...
well...
you also make your sevens like this.
you are not sanctioned to kill me.
fuck it.
what the fuck y'all waiting for?
do it.
fuck, you've been hit.
don't worry about it.
a bit better this time.
will you be all right to drive yourself home, Beatrice?
why don't you go over and introduce yourself to him?
Oh, Mom. What are you doing?
you're supposed to lie down and relax.
huh?
I was relaxing so much I saw a white light.
well, if you see it again, don't walk into it.
I still have a lot of things to take out on you for my childhood.
it's beautiful.
I love the color.
me too.
it's very pretty.
I'll run your bath.
you don't stop looking at him. You should ask him out.
go out.
live your life.
you're alive, after all.
Hello?
Hello?
I got your note.
Hi.
uh...
Hi.
go out.
go out on the balcony.
I...
I wasn't sure you got it.
I was wondering if I put it in the wrong box?
no.
no. It's mine.
so...
the note.
I just thought since we...
I thought it would be nice to finally meet you.
Beatrice.
Victor.
no, thanks.
you don't talk a lot.
not much, no.
it's okay.
I talk enough for both of us.
I talk too much. Everybody says so.
um...
you speak French?
I'd like to.
yeah? - Sure.
another language?
Hungarian.
you're Hungarian?
you don't have an accent.
I worked very hard to get rid of it.
so...
a job?
I'm...
right now I'm dabbling in real estate.
the people I work for, they buy buildings in need of renovations.
fix them up and run them.
hmm.
you? A job?
Yeah.
I was involved in a car accident last year.
I was a beautician before.
they rebuilt part of my face.
but it's kind of hard to give advice on beauty now.
and...
I have to smile a lot in my job.
most of the time, it hurts to smile.
I don't get to smile so much in my work.
no? - No.
maybe you and I should switch jobs. - Yeah.
so, what else?
I swear sometimes.
especially when I drink.
me too.
fuck.
shit.
careful. You're smiling.
tonight it's worth it.
I want to take you somewhere.
so where are we going?
are we going to a club?
no.
no? - Very cold.
very cold. - Yeah.
all right.
well, then are we going to a park?
Hmm...
warmer.
I thought you talk a lot?
I thought you don't.
must be the company. Usually, I don't.
you can turn here.
pull over. Just there.
you're afraid I'll think you came tonight because you felt sorry for me.
you don't have to play these games, Victor.
I know why you really came.
you're just being careful.
you want to find out if the girl who's been watching you saw what you did.
I saw you kill this man.
I saw you strangle him.
I saw you take him away.
now you're trying to clean up a mess that cannot be cleaned up.
but, I...
I think your secret will be safe with me.
this is the man who hit my car when he was drunk.
this is the man who did this to me.
I want you to kill him.
as you did with the man in your apartment.
wait a minute. - No.
if you don't do it, I'll call the police and tell them what I saw.
what the fuck are you...
his BMW.
it's fixed.
as if it had never happened.
but I can't be fixed.
he served three weeks.
three weeks for what he did to me.
stupid judge, he sat there and he looked at my face.
I want it done.
if you don't do it, I'll call the police and I'll tell them what I saw.
you'll do it!
you want to save yourself? Do it!
fuck.
he didn't pay. - I understand.
he didn't pay.
stop saying that! I understand!
are you gonna do it?
what I did, it has nothing to do with you.
you have to do this!
he ruined my life.
I have nothing. I am nothing.
I want it done as soon as possible.
then I will forget.
I will begin my life.
and I will forget that I ever met you.
do you know what it is to kill a man?
I will forget that I ever met you.
it's not a bug! It's not a rat!
I would never kill a bug or a rat!
he's much worse than these things!
you don't know what you're getting into with me!
you have no fucking idea!
I could have called the police.
I saved your life.
now you're gonna give me back mine.
if you're not going to kill me you don't have a choice.
back so soon?
Beatrice.
Beatrice, tell me what went wrong.
Beatrice.
Ah, Laszlo.
sorry I'm late. - No problem.
you look good.
it's good to see you.
were you worried I was going to forget your name?
Ah...
convention. You forget what it's like.
it's Andras who gave us the body for your grave.
whose body?
someone who deserved it, I'm sure.
is this where the whores are kept?
no, no, you are looking for your mother's boat. Two down.
we met.
two days after when they left you for dead.
Yeah.
soviet modified Dragunov.
shoots 7. 62 by 5. 4 rounds.
with all Russian PSO scopes. Comes with bayonet suppressor as well.
heavier than I expected.
I'll take it.
okay. All set.
what did he say?
Andras?
for 14 months you've infiltrated Alphonse.
they wanted to know why you've been waiting for so long to do what needs to be done.
he said if he was lucky enough to be standing, like you are, he'd want revenge, too.
but we're all worried you wait too long.
always kill the devil quickly when you find him. That was his advice.
I said you wanted to be close enough to watch him suffer.
but I really don't know the reason you're waiting.
so now... Now.
say it in English for me.
I...
...tied... - Yes?
I tied... - Yes?
my shoe. Today.
you tied what?
my shoe.
your shoe?
bigger smile than that. That's not the biggest smile you have.
so?
nothing. No one has seen your brother.
it's been two weeks, I am telling you.
he never goes more than a few days without calling me.
you know him. Sometimes he likes to get away.
no. Something is wrong.
what have I done to you?
where have you taken me?
I need foodstuffs.
I can help you.
if you let me go, he will spare you.
my brother, he will not stop looking for me.
and he will find you.
even if you get his money, even if they pay, he will find you.
you don't know who you're messing with!
he will kill you!
he will kill you!
monster's here.
monster!
Hey, monster...
if you put a bag over your head, we might hook up with you.
you have to take off your shoes.
my mom likes to keep the floor clean.
how long will it take?
long enough to be prepared.
you say he goes to this bar every night?
Yeah.
you know where he works?
he's looking for work.
as much as I could find out, I did.
I never thought about it before.
revenge.
but when I saw you kill that man in your apartment,
I knew I had my answer.
why did you do it?
I just want to know more about you.
I'm not here by choice.
Oh!
we have company.
she can't hear us. She lost most of her hearing as a child.
Oh, I forgot my cookies in the oven.
I took them out for you, Mom.
Oh, okay.
I'm looking for my hearing aids.
mom, I'd like you to meet Victor.
Oh!
Hello, Victor.
nice to meet you.
well, you look good.
you want to stay for lunch?
we're having chicken. Lemon chicken. It's very good.
and cookies, too.
we love cookies in this house.
you want cookies?
I can't stay, madame.
Oh, I want to show you something.
pictures of Beatrice.
you can see she has excellent genes.
isn't she pretty?
you see how beautiful she is?
Mmm.
I want it done as soon as possible.
maman? - Yes.
Victor has to go.
au revoir, Victor.
it was nice meeting you.
Oh, I forgot...
you'll hear from me when it's done.
cookies. - Uh...
it's for you. Take them.
a bit grumpy...
him, I have a good feeling about.
crackerjack.
got any grass?
that depends.
information is power, my friend.
you see anyone take a photo up there?
already told.
already told who?
another guy. A guy like you.
this is my friend Paul.
did you tell him?
hello. - It's Lon.
you know, people are flipping out.
you weren't sanctioned to do Harry.
or his men. Or leave a house full of dead Jamaicans!
no, I told you... - Can you try to imagine...
look, Lon... - Imagine what the fuck I'm dealing with?
no. You need to come see me right now.
you don't appreciate the severity of this.
you come now. I'm gonna be at Cafe Cora.
so...
we got dead Jamaicans, huh?
I'm listening.
well, Lon, for the last three months, Harry was messing with me.
trying to freak me out.
sending little notes like this with pictures, and threats and fucked-up shit.
I don't think he was too happy with the percentage deal.
okay.
I went in there to get answers, not dead Jamaicans.
Mmm-hmm.
turned out that way.
I lost two guys.
and truth is, I could have been just as dead as both of them.
you know Joe Bragg? And Herbert?
lowell Khan. And Weinberg?
they're my colleagues.
Yeah.
each received photos like these.
yeah?
yo, Vic. Where you at?
I'm in the middle of something.
Hey, listen, I was right.
Alphonse is still in danger.
this was not Harry and his men doing this shit.
how do you know that?
you know Cafe Cora? Can you get there?
I can find it.
Yeah, look, Alphonse is there with Lon Gordon.
I'm gonna call the rest of the crew and get them down there, all right?
how'd you know it wasn't Harry?
I'll be there in five.
fuck.
yo, Terry.
yeah?
I'm gonna look at these photos another way.
cause whoever's doing this is taking it seriously enough now to let us know that the loans to you, they're not secure.
that's respect enough to let us know his intentions.
you're not gonna be around.
you may not be around to collect.
Lon, that's exactly what Harry wanted you to think.
I got a note, too.
this morning.
it's addressed to you.
englishmen and Jamaicans, they don't send notes like this.
not after they've been killed in their own house.
what does it mean?
what does it mean?
and this key was taped to it.
you know what that key is for?
I want you to get the books and the deeds together for me now, all right?
every building you owe us for.
you understand this, don't you?
so the uptown buildings, you're pulling out of the deal?
we're not pulling out, Alphonse.
you're just in no condition right now to pull in.
shit!
Alphonse... Not right now.
there's a problem.
we need to go.
he's here. - What?
Oh, shit! Blotto's down. Get the shit!
Jesus! Get down!
Darcy! It's coming from the roof!
get in the car!
up there!
go, go, go!
get the fuck out of here!
Luco! You watch the elevator!
Dolph and Charles come upstairs!
Kilroy, back stairs with me! Now!
Darcy, he got out from the fifth floor.
what? He went out the window!
from the fifth fucking floor?
he's crazy.
Darcy!
what the fuck? Shit! Fuck!
Victor?
shit!
where is he?
they wasted Goff.
they wasted Charles, too.
over here! Come on!
get in!
come on!
over here!
come on!
what the fuck are you doing?
turn the fuck around! Turn the fuck around!
what the fuck! - Hi. I'm Beatrice.
you told me to get here.
I'm sorry I made him late.
what's going on?
see you later.
did you see anyone running here, Vic? - No.
Oh, shit!
he took out Blotto, Goff and even Charles. - Who?
we lost him.
fuck!
you guys all right?
tell him what you told me about the cab.
this guy in the building, he saw a man take this photo from the stairwell.
then they see him get into a cab. A gypsy cab.
paul was there, too. He found out the same thing.
it must've led him to something, because he was wasted for it.
find out where the cab went.
what did you do that for?
what I do what for?
go looking with the pictures.
you've only been on this crew a month longer than I have.
what if all this shit that's happening to Alphonse is because of something that went down before you came, huh?
this is an opportunity of magnumus proportions to me.
how's that?
of finding my next step in the organization.
Yeah, well, there might not be much of an organization left.
I could run this place for him, Victor.
better than Terry, a whole lot better than fucking Kilroy.
I ain't joking around.
if I could just crack this shit for...
this is serious shit, Darcy.
have enough money to buy Lise and Theo what they need.
move up the ladder.
what the fuck!
it's Lise's car. Mine's in the shop.
what? Are you back with her?
Yeah, she's acknowledging me.
it's a start, right?
I promised her I'd make a plan. Get ahead.
for her and for Theo.
just don't get too smart.
you saw what happened to Paul.
I don't want anything to happen to you.
I'm smarter than Paul.
I'm tired of being taken for a fucking douche.
I saw Alphonse respected me back there. - Oh, yeah?
I saw it in his eyes.
all right. We're good. That's it.
go on.
what the fuck.
I tied my shoe today.
I tied my shoe today.
I tied my shoe today.
hello. This is Victor, is Beatrice...
hello. This is Victor. Is Beatrice there?
what? There's no answer, no one is there.
hello.
it's me.
I believe you have something of mine?
Yeah.
why did you follow me?
it's not the first time.
I wanted to find out more about you.
I think it's lucky I did.
you want some water?
sure.
so, who are you?
my real name is Laszlo Kerik.
I was born in Hungary.
a few years ago my wife and I came to America.
I was an engineer before.
we came here looking for work.
we took an apartment in a building.
it was a building they wanted to control.
the man I saw?
they got most people out of the building.
one night they came and they fired some shots to scare us.
so we would leave.
a bullet went through a wall, and my daughter was killed while she slept.
we were going to testify. My wife and I.
the man responsible for it all, Alphonse, he gave his orders to make sure he never went to trial.
and they were followed.
he was afraid to use his own guys, so they sent a crew of Albanians after us.
they killed my wife, and they thought they killed me, too.
and they should have made sure of it.
cigarette?
Yeah.
when I manage to forget what happened to me, when there are no mirrors, and no people that reminds me, when my mom makes me laugh...
in these moments,
I have hope.
maman says that I...
that it's these moments that makes the pain bearable.
these moments.
I should try and find them where I can and hang onto them.
but they're fleeting.
and then I remember, and I'm filled with so much hate so I want to set the whole world on fire.
I'm sorry I made you tell me about your family.
I don't want to be one of those people that reminds you.
when you're the one who is going to help me forget.
these men, they don't seem easy to beat.
and you might have used up all your luck. So...
it's yellow... - Uh-uh.
chartreuse.
keep it.
I need you around.
rabbits don't come in chartreuse.
did you eat the cookies?
no.
maman makes a good cookie.
I only ask you to return the Tupperware.
she likes her Tupperware.
have you made any progress?
I will.
I know.
because I realize now that if I call the police and tell them what I saw, it's not prison you're afraid of.
it's that you won't get to finish your revenge.
I'm going to sleep in my own bed.
and why are you going to sleep in your own bed?
because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
why, baby? Tell me once more, why?
because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
bigger smile than that! That's not the biggest smile you have.
and why are you going to sleep in your own bed?
because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
why, baby? Tell me once more. Why?
because Daddy keeps care of the monsters.
I'm so happy that you're here.
Yeah.
I just needed some time, Florence.
now I'm going to cry.
I was worried when you didn't contact my friend.
Nicholas, the therapist. - Oh, yeah.
he really did wonders helping me out.
he could help you.
I found someone else.
as long as you're getting the help you need.
Yeah.
I'm in good hands.
you clever motherfucker.
open the fucking windows. It's fucking hot in here.
Hey, Kilroy, you want something to eat?
Yeah, I could eat.
I'm in my office.
anything going on?
no.
any pick-ups?
make sure you keep your cell on.
I don't know what else got going.
are you sure it's the AR 43?
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm looking at it right here.
it was installed two days ago.
then there is nothing wrong with your remote.
there's a barrier. Your signal won't get through.
the AR 43 is an IR unit that is used in most banks and government buildings.
what is the application for your trigger?
warehouse. - That's interference.
you will have to be inside the IR ring, or forget it.
unless you start from scratch, go to a new system.
no, I can't do that. Not enough time.
too much interference. You would have to detonate inside.
you lost a wife and a daughter.
but don't forget.
I lost a niece and her little one.
I don't want to lose you, too.
now you know everything.
no. No, I don't.
uh...
how come an engineer knows so much about guns?
military service. Back home.
so, what you said on the phone. Is that your plan?
to get everybody into this warehouse?
Yes. Alphonse is always there.
I just need to get the Albanians there, too.
there are many men.
but your bombs doesn't work.
they work.
that's one way of looking at it.
another is that you don't care if you get out of there.
you'd rather die than fail.
don't worry about it. I'll be around long enough to do what you asked me to do.
I don't want you to do that. Bring me food.
my mom likes to cook.
it would just go to waste otherwise.
I'll wedge it in between the mustard and those plastic explosives.
you may not care if you get out alive, but in the meantime, you should eat.
my rabbit's foot. If you don't believe in it, I'll take it back.
Bye.
sign right here.
Ilir.
where did you get this?
a delivery came.
same bogus return address again.
they have your brother.
there's a little girl.
Hello? - Hey, it's Fonz. Listen.
I found this lawyer.
he says he can close the financing on those uptown buildings.
and he don't know anything about Lon pulling out.
is this guy clean?
Yeah.
he wants to see the Commerce Building.
so I'm gonna meet him there tonight at 9: 00.
I don't know, man. What if our problem shows up?
pulls some fucking "I don't know" kind of shit.
no, you're the only one that knows.
I gotta go.
Yeah. Yo, Vic. You with anybody?
Yeah. I'm busy. - Well, drop your dick.
I found the Gypsy cab.
the guy at the cab company says he remembers Paul. Paul was there.
I'm like a detective, man.
like Columbo. I'm scaring myself.
vic? - Right. I'll be right down.
Hey, Vic. Vic. This girl you're seeing.
she your girlfriend?
no. No, it ain't serious.
she's got... Her face.
Yeah. Car accident.
did it affect her?
you have no idea.
Hey, you never mentioned her before.
you embarrassed about me?
Yeah, I'm embarrassed about you.
you're embarrassed about your friends? Huh? Fuck you talking about?
so. This is it right here.
huh?
the cab dropped off Paul right here.
you're sure? - Yeah.
they keep a track, drop offs, pick-ups.
all right, detective? Can we leave now?
a cemetery?
that's creepy.
the office is closed tomorrow. But I could call them.
maybe I'll come by with a picture of Paul.
see if anybody knows anything.
all right.
fuck.
come on. I gotta get out of here.
everything okay?
Yeah. I just got some business to take care of.
come on in.
so what did you tell Darcy?
your text said not to tell anyone I was coming.
I told him I was...
had something to do.
here's your food.
I set a trap, Victor.
I said whoever walks through that door at 9: 00
was going to have a real bad night.
the person doing this to me, he's hurt.
someone who lost someone.
like the people in the picture.
and he's in a great deal of pain because of that.
and it's a pain that I've caused.
then he kills Paul.
and found he was in both feet.
Victor, I want him to know something.
I want him to know that if there's anything left in this world that he still cares about,
I'm going to find it.
and I'm gonna burn it down.
he's probably wondering right now what I'm thinking.
what my plan is.
and how much I know.
wouldn't you be wondering what I'm thinking?
I would.
you know, you're the only one I can trust, Victor.
you know why?
no.
because you saved my life at Harry's.
it would be something, though.
if you saved my life only to be the one who kills me.
have a seat.
I must stand, please.
Shh.
they're outside.
the other day...
you told me that if I helped you...
Yes!
believe what I say, my friend.
I don't know, my boss...
he will not know.
you guarantee that?
that I won't be harmed?
I swear to God. Please.
you're asking me these things, so I know you've been thinking about it.
about me in here.
all right.
listen to me. You're in the city. All right?
you're in the basement of my boss's warehouse.
his name is Alphonse. Alphonse Hoyt.
I don't know what your brother or his men did to him, but they're gonna kill you whether he pays or not.
I got a camera.
you can record a message for your brother. I'll make sure he gets it.
we gotta go fast.
tell him where you are. It's important you tell him where you are.
I swear to you.
speak.
Ilir, Ilir, listen...
I'm alive, brother. I don't know for how much longer.
they're going to kill me. Even if you pay them the money, they're going to kill me.
they're holding me in a warehouse that belongs to Alphonse Hoyt.
I beg you. I beg you, brother, come quickly.
a warehouse that belongs to Alphonse Hoyt... Alphonse Hoyt!
thank you. Thank you.
I promise you.
we killed you. We killed you all!
we killed you all!
I swear on their graves, you didn't.
I swear! I swear on their graves, you didn't!
no, no, no! No! No!
no, no, no! No!
don't let me die like this! Please! Please!
don't let me die!
please have mercy! Please!
don't let me die like this! Please!
Yeah. Yo, I tracked down the manager.
what manager? - From the boneyard.
I thought it was closed today.
he's gonna be here in 15. Says he needs to feed some fish or some shit.
I can meet him alone, if you're busy.
no, no, I'll be there.
all right. All right.
fuck!
I need to send this package.
but I gotta take care of something I didn't count on, so can you send it for me?
Yeah.
what is it?
you don't need to know what it is.
I need to know what it is.
what is it?
it's a video. It's one of the Albanians saying something I need him to say to the person I need him to say it to.
all right?
okay.
you need to get a tracking number. With alerts to my cell phone.
Yeah. All right.
Thanks.
wait.
tell your mother it was very good.
yeah?
not too salty?
no.
it was perfect.
Hey, this shit's coming together.
paul was definitely here.
how'd you know he was here?
the manager.
he asked for this.
it's a list of all the people buried here.
the guy said he was more interested in the Hungarian section.
the Hungarian section. Did he say why?
no.
there's hundreds of them.
Ah.
what happened to that girl?
that girl you told me about across the way from you.
you ever meet her?
Yeah. I met her.
And?
you didn't die two years ago.
they found the cemetery.
they're getting close.
the one who found you before got lucky.
and just because he found the grave doesn't mean that they will figure it out as well.
you can walk away, still.
not too late.
I know why you've been waiting so long.
why you haven't killed him.
I think you're afraid that when it's over, it won't mend your heart.
you're beautiful.
it was going to waste. I just felt like putting it on.
I know why you put it on.
or should I say, for whom.
Hey, monster! - Hey!
get out of here! - Come on!
what... What happened?
I fell and ruined a nice dress. - Let me see.
you Okay?
Yeah.
at least it wasn't my good side.
I sent your package.
I have your tracking number.
thank you.
Hello, Victor. - Hello.
go take off your dress, it's covered in blood.
he shouldn't see you like this.
thank you for returning my Tupperware. - Of course.
people usually don't. Like it comes with the food.
free Tupperware.
did you like the food?
Yeah. The food was...
it was very good. Beatrice didn't tell you?
she was nervous you wouldn't like her cooking.
I always told her the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
one of the ways.
she'll keep you well fed. That's for sure.
you know, this thing, me falling and hitting my head?
maybe it happened because I lost my rabbit's foot.
the truth is my mom gave it to me after the accident.
she said it was going to bring me luck with my procedures.
I picked the color.
stupid chartreuse.
hey
would you go out with me tonight?
somewhere.
anywhere.
Yeah.
okay.
Yeah. - Laszlo Kerik.
Laszlo Kerik? You know the name?
no. No, I don't know him. - I didn't think you would.
I've been searching every dead Hungarian on this cemetery list.
this shit went down about nine months before we were on the crew.
there was a case involving Alphonse and a little girl who was killed in one of his buildings.
the case never went to trial. Get this, right?
the little girl's mommy and daddy, they died, like, two months afterwards.
they're buried right there next to her.
vic?
you there? Vic? Vic?
Yeah. I'm here. - I did it, man.
I fucking did it.
I found out exactly what Paul must have found out.
look, I want to tell Alphonse. I want you to be there when I tell him.
can you get there?
no, I'm in the middle of something. I'll talk to you later.
Oh, Victor.
I didn't know you were coming. I would have thrown something on.
maman, you knew very well he was coming.
no, you didn't tell me anything.
well, I told you so.
ready? - Mmm-hmm.
so...
where are we going?
you'll see.
a club?
very cold.
a park?
are you okay?
Yeah. Good.
this is... - The bar.
in his house, some credit card receipts.
he usually leaves the bar at 8: 30 every night. But he took a trip.
I want to make sure he's back.
if he's here tonight, he'll probably be here tomorrow night.
I'm prepared to do it then.
I...
I've found a moment with you.
I want to hang on to it.
it's not gonna end up that way.
I never said it would.
not with words.
I wore that white dress for you.
was that a mistake?
Yes.
all right, wait here. I'll be back in a minute.
what did you do?
it's done.
it's done.
one, two.
Nope.
Uh-uh.
hold up. It's this one.
so you're saying it's someone who knew them?
he must have.
cause this guy's dead, right?
right?
what is it?
the little girl died June 17th.
two years ago. Right?
Yeah.
june 17th is tomorrow.
Beatrice.
what are you doing?
Oh, my God.
Beatrice!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
what?
Yeah, I'm walking back to him now. Okay.
Yeah.
Hey, you know who this is, right?
Yeah, I know who it is.
I've been getting these weird letters for the last three months.
with pictures? With the eyes crossed out?
I've been getting them, too.
whoever is doing it took my brother.
you remember this problem I had you take care of for me?
hungarian Rhapsody?
you stayed to the finale. Right?
Yeah.
and the whole family took a bow?
Yeah.
and you're sure you saw the father take a bow?
where the fuck have you been? I've been trying to call you.
my car won't start.
some shit's going down, man.
the fucking thing won't start.
what am I going to tell you?
come pick me up. - What?
bring every fucking gun we have.
Ilir...
Brozi? - Here?
vic?
you didn't mail the package.
you didn't kill him.
you didn't kill him because you feel something for me.
you knew how I would feel.
you didn't mail the package.
I tried.
and the guy walked away, and I called him back.
I called him back, because I feel something for you.
I could love you.
I don't want you to die.
so I thought that if I could just mess up one of your things, just one thing, it would be enough so it wouldn't work out the way you planned.
so I put my rabbit's foot in that package.
and I took the video card out.
they got my rabbit's foot instead.
we can run away.
they'd find us.
we keep on running.
we travel by night. I don't care how far we have to go.
vic?
shithole.
holy shit.
where are you going? You come back here!
your father is speaking to you.
Laszlo.
fucking Laszlo.
I'm gonna wait for you here.
where are you?
I'm outside your apartment. Come back. Please.
Beatrice, I want you to go to your apartment now.
go there now, and stay there and wait for me. Okay?
come here!
if you fucking scream, it will go bang. Okay? Okay.
Laszlo fucking Kerik.
you made me a douche, Laszlo Kerik. I've seen your artwork.
I've seen your fucking pictures. You put Paul in the freezer.
this has nothing to do with you.
I sent you to my apartment to save you.
all right? You weren't supposed to go inside.
Yeah, but I did go inside. I was worried about you.
I don't want to fucking kill you.
take this opportunity, and you let her go.
you lied to me. You fucking lied to me.
the godfather of my son.
let her go. Let her go.
you listen to me. You get in your shitty car that does start.
you start your shitty car. And you drive your shitty car to Alphonse's.
we'll be waiting.
fuck.
get up!
what does it mean?
Darcy's here with the girl.
hmm.
what happened to your face?
car accident.
what happened to yours?
you motherfuckers.
Victor.
Alphonse. Don't go anywhere.
are you coming for me?
no. I'm coming for her.
Yeah, well, she won't be here when you get here.
Oh, shit.
take her to my room!
and don't fucking move!
motherfucker! He just shot Luco.
no, look! He's coming up the back stairs.
all right now! I've got something for your ass!
follow him, Ilir! Down the fucking stairs!
Hey, Victor! Remember I told you if there was anything left you still cared about,
I was gonna find it and I was gonna burn that shit down.
how about this, huh.
you are dead, fuck!
Hey, where the fuck did you go?
what does it mean?
what is he saying?
what the fuck are you doing, man?
don't you raise that fucking gun.
don't you do it! Don't you fucking do it!
bitch, lower the fucking gun!
did you choose not to kill me 'cause I got a wife and a kid?
no.
I didn't kill you because they've got you.
come on, get up.
you need to buy gifts for your kids before we leave.
I'll pick up something at the airport.
no way.
airport gifts suck.
Marie, please let me sleep another half hour.
fine.
if you won't buy the gifts for your kids, I will.
can you ask the front desk to prepare the bill and have some breakfast sent up?
you know what? The posters are up, all over paris.
apparently, you can't miss them.
how many have you seen?
Really?
good morning. Could you prepare the bill for 321?
sure. And could you send up some breakfast coffee and fruit?
okay, I'll call room service. Thank you.
they said there would be 120 across paris.
can you sum up the headlines for me? I won't have time to go online.
that's good.
big kisses, bye-bye.
hello.
Oh, I like this one. You have more like this?
yes?
Yes. Take this one. Yes.
how much? One dollar.
come on, come on, come on.
give me your hand! Give me.
give me your hand!
can you reach me? Take my hand.
all right, hold on. She's not breathing.
think she's gone, dude.
get back, get back! Everybody get off the boat!
come on.
roll her over on her side.
breathe, breathe. Vomit it out. Good, vomit.
turn her back around.
are you okay? You okay? Yeah.
you're okay. We got you.
slow. Slow down.
Marie.
port OF SAN FRANCISCO
come in and have a seat. I'll go talk to my brother, okay?
no, I'm okay. Okay. Sit, sit, sit.
how could you do this to me?
what? You know I don't do this anymore.
just one time. This guy's a real important client of mine.
I need this. Come on.
this is it. I know.
this is it. I know.
okay. Mr?
Andreou. Christos.
Christos. Okay.
I'm gonna hold your hands just until I get a connection, and then just for the purposes of the reading, confine your answers to yes or no.
give me your hands?
a woman close to you has passed?
Yes.
in her middle age? Was she in her fifties? Yes.
was this woman your wife?
Yes.
and I'm picking up you were together for a long time.
Yep.
but it wasn't always easy. No.
now I'm picking up she was sick. Yep.
she was sick for a long time. Did she have difficulty moving?
Yes.
was she bedridden?
Yes. She had multiple sclerosis.
I'm sorry.
she wants to apologize to you for ruining the marriage.
that's not true.
she feels bad that you had to care for her, even as a young man and wishes that you'd find someone now, before it's too late.
because you're not getting any younger.
or slimmer.
no.
she's got quite a sense of humor.
Yeah. She's really funny.
okay, wait. Now she's telling me to pay attention.
okay, she has something important she needs to say.
okay, she's trying to give me some kind of a date. June.
in June?
did that mean anything to you?
no. Is that when you were married? June?
is that when she passed? No.
I mean, she's being very specific about June.
Yeah, June.
hm. Well, maybe I'm wrong. That happens.
I don't even do this anymore.
guess I'm rusty.
thank you. I can't thank you enough.
Hey. Thanks, baby brother. Okay.
I owe you.
that was incredible.
your brother, I'm telling you, he's for real.
I know. No, no, no. He's really for real.
I gotta tell you I was skeptical before I came. All this psychic shit is mumbo-fucking-jumbo as far as I'm concerned.
he was telling me things I'd never told anybody.
he could make money. He did. Good money.
for a while had an office, website, newspaper articles, even had a book written about him.
yeah? So, what happened?
couldn't cope. Turned his back on the whole thing.
he told me, he said, "A life that's all about death is no life at all."
he works at a factory and makes 2 grand a month. He says he's happy.
who knows? He wasn't gonna do this again.
I had to persuade him to make an exception in his case.
well, I appreciate it, man. I mean, this was.
I owe you. All right, I'll talk to you Monday about that thing?
Yeah. Great, Christos, thanks.
Hey. What was with June, if you don't mind me asking?
june Menendez was my wife's nurse.
took care of her for 15 years.
for 10 of those years, I was in love with her.
and I felt so guilty I couldn't tell anybody.
least of all June herself.
right.
all right, I'll see you.
we might have gone about half a mile and my pocket handkerchief was quite wet through when looking out, to my amazement, I saw Peggotty burst from a hedge.
she jumped up into the carriage. Not a single word did she speak.
she squeezed me until the pressure on my nose was extremely painful crammed some pieces of cake into my pockets and a purse, which she put into my hand.
then she got down and ran away.
presently, I noticed one of her buttons rolling around on the floor.
I picked it up and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time.
Oliver & Johnson Photography
okay, you two. Yeah.
Oh, lovely. Come on, you guys. Which one of you two is the oldest?
twelve minutes. Really? Do you know, I think I could tell.
and you're Marcus? No, he's Marcus.
right. The quiet one.
I was gonna say the handsome one. I'm Jason.
Jason, yeah, all right. The oldest. The chatterbox.
the smartass.
lovely. Think we're done.
okey-dokey. What did you guys do, rob a phone box?
thank you. Go on.
Bye. Cheers, bye-bye.
what's the matter? I don't understand it. Can I copy yours?
no. Please. It has to be in tomorrow.
tough bananas.
she can see it in the morning.
good night, Jase.
good night.
shit.
Jackie? Are you in there?
come on, open up.
come on, wake up.
open up, please!
boys, it's no use. We know you're covering for her.
wake her up. Make her look better. Social Services.
mom! Mom, wake up!
Jackie, you in there?
she's not here. She's gone to the shops.
mom, come on!
we're gonna wait.
boys, it's no use. We know you're covering for her.
come on, Mom. Get up, please!
come on. You're wasting our time.
if she's not here in five minutes we'll call the police Child protective Unit.
come on. Open up.
he means that! Five minutes!
Thanks. I've got it.
Jason, open the door.
you can come in and wait for her if you want.
have a seat.
Thanks.
hope she won't be much longer.
I'm home!
hello. I didn't know you were gonna be here.
I completely forgot you were gonna be here.
Jason, go put the kettle on.
Marcus, go and get a plate. Let's get these biscuits out.
have you been here long? A while.
sorry.
it's all right, Jackie. Why don't you sit down?
you know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking that is the best present in the whole wide world.
absolutely love it. Thank you.
thank you.
my boys.
Marcus, will you do something? Yeah.
get the red box in the cupboard. Yes, Mom.
thank you.
now, I want you to go down to the chemist.
give this to the nice man. Then he'll know what to do, okay?
Yes, Mom. Thank you, baby.
I'll do it. Why?
Marcus hasn't done his homework yet.
go on, then. Call me on this and I'll talk you through it.
Yeah, but not long, okay? I haven't got any credit.
take care, Jason, okay?
I will. I'll see you later.
and why haven't you done your homework?
come here, you.
look at your silly little face. An angel.
okay. It's okay. Forget about your homework. You can copy mine.
I want you to look up naltrexone and hydrochloride.
okay. Hang on a minute.
found it. I think this is it.
naltrexone blocks the effects of heroin and of opiates.
detoxification can last between a week and a month.
does that mean she's stopping?
Yeah, I think that's exactly what it means.
this is great. She's never done this before up till now.
it's just been promises.
Yeah, I knew it was just a matter of time. There you are.
thank you.
just think. It'd be like living in a normal family for once.
that kid's got a mobile.
Hey, little one.
Hey, come here, lad.
leave me alone!
give me your phone, mate.
give me that back!
Jase?
what do you got pills for? You're a little freak.
get your phone, brother. Get your phone.
grab him! Wait a minute, little prick!
come here! Little prick!
come on, little prick!
come on, you little dickhead, where you going?
Jase?
Marcus!
Jason?
Jason?
please, Jason.
Jason, come on. I need you.
please.
come on. Come on.
Jason!
Jason, come on. Please, Jase.
Jase.
one catastrophe sans precedent.
I feel bad. I should've stayed on to cover the story.
after what happened to you?
they've sent a crew from the Hong Kong office.
I've never done that run away from such a story.
you okay? Yeah.
should I come up? No, I'll be fine.
I almost forgot the gifts for your kids.
I love you.
the estimated figures are at several billion dollars.
but of course, we're going to talk about the survivors because we hope there are survivors.
the number of victims is estimated at several hundred thousand.
it is a horrific scene here, as this tsunami has devastated the population.
france televisions.
good evening, everyone.
Marie, can you hear me?
everybody, break a leg. Ready and on the air in five, four， three, two and cue, Miss Lelay.
good evening, and welcome to a new edition of Window on Events.
tonight, our guest is Guillaume Belcher
ceo of famous clothing manufacturer Soucil.
we're going to present to you a shocking investigation on child labor in their factories in Southeast Asia.
cyril Guignard reporting.
here in the West, it's easy to criticize Third World labor practices.
but the truth is these factories play a vital role in industrial development and evolution of poorer countries.
and let's be clear about this, the wages we are paying are substantially higher than local wages.
Marie, go at him!
Marie, do you hear me?
pull this guy apart!
you hear me, get him!
but will this kind of justification satisfy French customers
Mr. Belcher?
if they were aware of the conditions under which the clothes are produced do you think you would still be profitable?
go there and you'll see how much these people need us.
thank you for watching.
that's all for now, see you next week.
I'm sorry, that was unforgivable.
we'll fix it in the edit. No one will notice.
and it was my fault.
a defensive CEO was a tough start for the new season.
do you want to get something to eat?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I think something happened to me out there.
you had a close call.
no, something really happened to me.
when I went underwater.
I had visions.
I don't know.
you had a concussion. You hit your head.
you're right.
two right-wing newspapers claim Sikhs were out in the streets burning cars, looting shops.
others say the unrest was triggered by elements within the nationalist parties to cast negative suspicion on racial minorities.
what do you think about the story on the Sikhs?
what?
the story on the Sikhs, what do you think?
it's very good.
listen, I've got to work late and finish some things.
see you tomorrow.
can I say something you might find difficult to hear?
I think you came back to work too soon.
physically, you're fine. But since the accident.
take some time off to get over what happened.
just a couple of weeks.
to "get over"?
you've always said you wanted to write.
your book idea, Michel would jump on it and pay good money.
but that would take time.
this will all be here waiting for you.
what matters is that you feel better.
we need you too much.
I'll think about it.
you see that meeting going on? On the first floor?
the head office guys and the union? No, no, I didn't.
Yeah, well, they were in there all afternoon.
kind of makes you think the rumors are true, huh?
what rumor?
that they're gonna let 30 percent of the workforce go.
you heard that, right?
Yeah, right. Right.
what's the matter with you today?
no, I just didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
well, see you tomorrow, all right?
Yeah, yeah. I'll see you. Yeah.
down the end of the hall, on your left. Hi， there.
welcome, all of you, to this 10-week course in Italian cuisine.
my name is Carlo. Some of you know me already.
you've done some of my other courses.
those of you that don't, buonasera, and you can call me "Chef ."
we'll be working in pairs throughout the course so one of the first things I want to do today is to pair you all up.
all right? Don't be shy. Grab a partner.
I see some of you have come in twos already.
others have worked together before.
okay. Now who's left?
excuse me. God. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry I'm late.
the roads were closed for some reason plus this jerk in registration took an age processing my application.
am I too late?
no. No, no. Not at all. What is your name?
Melanie. Okay, Melanie, we were just pairing people off.
why don't we put you with.
what is your name? George.
okay, George.
Melanie with George. And, Alice, you're with
Tony.
how you doing, Tony?
sorry. All right.
now, in exercise class, you warm up with stretches.
we're gonna warm up with a glass of Barbaresco a beautiful wine from the piedmont region in northwestern Italy made from the Nebbiolo grape. Hi. George.
take a sip.
and some music.
because cooking is all the senses, right?
the nose, the eyes, the palate and the ears.
and tonight, we're gonna start at the beginning.
the cornerstone of so much of Italian cooking the classic tomato sauce from Toscana.
and in preparation, we're gonna need chopped tomatoes, so let's get chopping.
take your time. Doing all right? Look at these beautiful tomatoes, huh?
Ah, the music. Is this beautiful?
God, some of them are really good.
is this your first time?
Yeah. Yeah, mine too.
I read in the brochure that the course builds to a competition.
I saw that. To be judged by a local restaurant critic.
Yeah. I don't think we should get our hopes up. Heh, heh.
well, we still have 10 weeks.
well, that's true. And we haven't cut our fingers off yet.
that's a good attitude.
which one of us is using the wrong knife? Am I using the wrong knife?
Yeah. You're using that.
the woman next to me brought her own knife.
Really? Very intimidating.
so I'll see you next week.
great. Yeah. See you next week.
george Lonegan? Yeah.
I hate to bother you.
I'm Mr. Andreou's neighbor.
the Greek guy, mid-fifties, who lost his wife.
I believe you recently did a reading for him.
I'm just gonna stop you. Candace.
okay, Candace, I don't do readings anymore.
you did one last week for Mr. Andreou.
he's an associate of my brother's. It was a one-time thing.
please, I give you my word. I won't tell anyone.
I'm sorry. Listen, listen, listen. I brought money.
I don't want your money. Everything I have.
I lost my child.
my only child. Just a baby.
I just wanna talk to her.
please, I wanna talk to my baby.
I can't help you. I don't do that anymore!
please! Mr. Lonegan! I got money!
Mr. Lonegan. Please.
I wanna talk to my baby.
go, girls! There you go! Kick it!
so another person came to see me for a reading.
thanks to your friend Mr. Andreou.
what? Yeah.
told that Greek jerk to keep his big mouth shut.
go, girls! Kick it back! You gotta kick it back!
well, obviously he didn't.
I'll talk with him, make sure nothing like that ever happens again, okay?
okay.
And?
and what? Did you do it?
what? The reading.
did you do the reading? You still don't get it, do you?
you think just because I can make money doing this just because I can that I should do it.
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
I also think you have a duty to do it because you have a gift.
it's not a gift, Billy. It's a curse.
you have no idea. It ruins any chance I have at a normal life.
feel like a freak.
freak?
freak or not, Georgie, it's who you are.
it's what you are, you know. You can't run from that forever.
to divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject
I informed Mr. Micawher that I relied on him for a bowl of punch and led him to the lemons.
his recent despondency, not to say despair, was gone in a moment.
I never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself amid the fragrance of lemon peel and sugar, and the smell of burning rum as he stirred and mixed and tasted and looked as if he were making, instead of punch a fortune for his family to last for all posterity.
death is not final. It is merely the beginning.
gateway to an afterlife that reflects our conduct here on earth.
God, in his infinite generosity, has created heaven which is where Jason is now surrounded by all the angels and saints, looking down at us.
and so we commit Jason's body to dust, his soul already in God's care.
Jason's ashes will be available at the back
at the meantime, but if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like you to leave through the front door.
morning.
please come in.
thank you.
morning.
good night, Jase.
it won't be for long. It's a short-term placement.
just until your mum feels better.
the couple we have in mind have a lot of experience and live close to where you live now.
of course you'll stay at the same school.
I don't wanna go with anyone else.
I wanna stay with you.
where are you going?
just give us a minute, will you?
look, I need a little time to sort myself out.
but I'm not running away, I promise.
I could stay with you now, and I want that so much.
but chances are I wouldn't make it, because I'm not strong enough.
I don't expect you to understand.
and I know for me to leave you now it must feel like the worst thing in the world.
but I promise you I'm not gonna let you down, okay?
I promise you.
I'm so sorry.
I love you. Come here.
come here.
be a good boy.
come on.
summing up France's postwar, only two statesmen counted: De Gaulle and him.
on de Gaulle, everything's been written.
on Mitterrand, I want to finish the job.
there are fascinating elements.
the abolition of the death penalty, the European Union.
coming from a right-wing family, he seduced the left.
and what's more, converted it to liberalism.
amazing! It was a revolution, right?
plus the darker sides of his character that have never been explored.
he's been dead for 10 years. The timing is right, we can dig deeper.
I want to dig into his past.
Vichy, the Elf scandal What part did he play?
the Taiwan frigates, the papon scandal.
Mazarine, Marguerite Duras.
these stories were never really addressed. They've all been buried.
I'm going to tell who knew, who didn't talk.
isn't that going to bring us too much controversy?
I don't think so.
what I want is a book that can be read by all.
mitterrand was not just a politician.
mitterrand was an icon.
he's "Tonton," our uncle!
maybe that's what we should use as the title!
Tonton. Heh, heh, heh.
I'm not sure we can keep that title.
of course not. It was a joke.
I'll welcome your suggestions for the title.
how about Chipping Away at the Myth or The Vacillating Statue?
I look forward to your suggestions.
we'll make a list.
Congratulations.
the timing couldn't be better.
politically, there's nothing going on now anyway.
you'll write the book you've always wanted to. You'll get some rest.
come this summer, you'll be back on the air with a bestseller under your belt, and a big renegotiated contract.
stronger than ever.
exactly.
adapting and turning misfortune to your advantage.
that's what I've always loved about you, never a victim.
that's right.
never a victim, never vulnerable, never complains.
excuse me. Your table is ready.
great. I'm starving.
can I ask you something?
what do you think happens when we die?
that's a strange question!
tell me.
when you die, you die. The lights go out, that's it.
Why?
that's it? Just blackout?
totally black, the plug's pulled out.
the eternal void.
don't you think it's possible that there is something?
like what?
I don't know, something
a hereafter.
no, I don't.
if that were the case, wouldn't someone have discovered it by now?
and there would be proof.
I guess.
do you have a lot of questions like that?
more champagne?
a JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE AFTER DEATH
adult EDUCATION
okay, does everyone have their blindfolds on?
okay.
now, if you wanna be a good cook, first we need to work on your palate.
to stimulate your imaginations, your senses.
no good being an expert chopper, dicer, roaster, toaster if you can't give names and colors, and even shapes, to flavors.
okay. Now, spoon number one.
now, look, this isn't easy.
so don't worry if you don't immediately identify it.
let's start by trying to describe it.
what is the texture?
okay, you ready?
what is the consistency? Open.
very good.
what?
I have no freaking idea what this is.
no freaking idea. Okay.
but, um.
it's not a fruit.
it's kind of nutty.
but it's kind of sweet too. I think. Okay.
a little nutty.
kind of sweet.
did she get it? Yeah.
so how are we gonna do this?
what?
well, we could make up a whole load of crap, or we could cut to the chase and be honest with one another.
about?
about why we're both doing night-school classes?
all right. Open.
everybody okay? How we doing?
there's, um.
there's something oaky about that.
oaky. Okay.
Yeah. Nutmeggy? I think. Okay.
you're not gonna tell me it's because you wanna make the perfect spaghetti vongole, right?
no, not entirely.
okay. I'll jump in.
I'm doing this because I'm new to San Francisco.
because I'm looking to make new friends.
and who knows? If I'm lucky, maybe even meet the man of my dreams.
here, open. Okay.
so why'd you move to San Francisco?
because I got dumped by someone in Pittsburgh.
sorry.
not quite at the aisle, but pretty close.
down payment on the wedding dress, honeymoon booked.
that kind of thing.
I mean, it's okay. You know, I'm.
I'm over it, just about.
not at all, actually.
What'd that taste like?
I don't know.
I mean, I really I don't
wanna try again? Yeah, okay.
okay.
ready? Uh-huh.
okay.
is that a bean? Yeah.
Really? Yeah.
you know what color it is?
it's like...
tastes like a black bean.
am I right? Yes.
how we doing? Don't be shy.
here we go. Oh, well like you, I recently made a big change to my life and I just wanted to reevaluate things and change my priorities.
what was? What was the change?
divorce or?
Oh, no, no, nothing like that. No.
a job that I needed to put behind me.
it was making any kind of life impossible.
definitely a nut.
you're not gonna tell me, you know, what the job was?
would you mind if I didn't?
I mean, don't worry, I wasn't like a criminal or anything.
okay. So open up. Okay.
no hitting on Alice.
peppers. Yeah.
wasn't that great? Yeah, fun.
God, it's made me so hungry.
Yeah, me too.
do you wanna get something to eat?
Yeah. There's actually a place nearby that everyone's talking about.
place nearby, are you kidding me? We're practically experts ourselves.
I can drive. Yeah. Oh, yeah, great, okay.
so you been in San Francisco long?
born and bred, yeah.
Oh, nice.
you can just leave all that. I'll get it. You just get comfortable.
no, I'm your partner. Remember? I have to...
we have to do this together. Okay.
Oh, my gosh. Are these?
this is you? As a kid?
Yeah, that's me and my brother, Billy.
let me tell you, you got the looks.
well, he got everything else.
are these his kids?
Yeah. My nieces.
who's this?
is this some kind of ancestor?
no, that's Charles Dickens.
Oh. I'm a fan. I'm a huge fan.
you know, people go on and on about Shakespeare and it's.
I mean, he's great, of course, but Dickens.
no, no, I'll get that. I got it.
there's a little trick.
Hey. It's Billy.
just to say I finally caught up with our Greek friend.
told him to keep his mouth shut. Okay?
just relax. There shouldn't be any more freaks knocking on your door asking for readings, you know?
I gotta say though, this guy he made a big point of saying how brilliant you were and with so many fakers out there, someone who had a genuine gift.
I don't know
sorry about that.
what gift? Oh, nothing. Don't worry about it.
no, I mean, I'm interested.
well, the job I had before, it was as a psychic.
I know, but...
what? But it's true.
I had an illness as a child and I had an infection, which turned into a fever which turned into inflammation of my brain and spinal cord.
it's called encephalomyelitis.
and they had to operate, in the back, here.
it was a complicated procedure. It was eight hours.
and they nearly lost me.
actually, technically, they did lose me and bring me back on a number of occasions.
anyway, they cured the illness but they must've messed up something else while they were back there, because...not long after, I started to have these migraines.
and then nightmares.
and then these connections.
and one day I'm sitting with a friend, and I had a vision of a woman a crystal-clear vision.
and I described her to him.
and turned out it was an exact description of his mother, someone I'd never met who'd died the previous week.
can I get you to sign right here, please? - Okay. Here you go.
Thanks. -You're welcome.
Hi, Will. Package for you.
I don't think anyone ever imagines on their wedding day be part of the 46% that doesn't live happily ever after.
will?
just heard we got the Quaker Oats account.
way to go. You must be completely psyched.
then again,
I never thought I'd spend my days, weeks and years working in an advertising agency trying to figure out how to get kids to eat Cap'n Crunch instead of Froot Loops.
but Tuesdays and Fridays are my favorite days.
I get out of work early, and I go pick up my daughter, Maya, from school.
now, it's a great feeling when you find the right track to go with the day.
and today, I have found the absolute perfect song.
bitches, they can kiss my...
the other perfect song.
thank you.
you're welcome.
but sometimes, no matter how carefully you plan your playlist, there is no right track for what awaits you.
come on, come on! -Hey, what's going on?
will, did you know there was gonna be a sexed class today?
aren't they kind of young?
Yeah! It was a total disaster. -At least it got them reading.
there's a book!
the 250 million sperm are ejaculated and begin their treacherous journey towards the fallopian tubes!
one hundred million are wiped out instantly...
I'm gonna find Maya.
GlRL: Do you still have sex with Daddy?
what are you talking about? -Do you?
you know, we will go home and talk... -You do, don't you?
we will go home and talk about this. -GlRL: I hate you, I hate you!
stop pulling on me! I am trying to get to the bottom of something!
we need to talk.
which is when the man removes his penis from his pajamas and thrusts it into a woman's vagina...
okay, but Mrs. Gallagher didn't actually say "thrust."
Yeah. -Oh.
but what I don't understand,
Sammy Boigon's sister said he was an accident.
I mean, how do you accidentally thrust a penis into... Hi, Luis.
Hey. -How do you accidentally...
stop saying "penis" and "thrust." Just say "tinkle part" or "wee-wee."
something cute.
explain how Sammy was an accident. -That's complicated.
penis! Penis. -Okay. All right, that's enough.
okay, they...
it's not like his dad slipped on a banana peel.
the accident was that Sammy's mom got pregnant.
if they didn't want a baby, then how come they had sex?
that's a very good question.
I guess you could say that they were rehearsing.
was I an accident? -No.
I was, wasn't I? -No.
you were completely and totally on purpose. I knew exactly what I was getting into.
I think you should tell me the story of you and my mom.
why do you keep saying "my mom" like I've never met her?
well, because now that you're getting divorced, she's mine, not yours.
is that so? -Tell me how it happened.
and the real story, not the, "Oh, we met, we fell in love, and we decided to take all that love and make a family, and that's how we made you."
you know something? I'm gonna tell you the real, true story of how me and your mother met.
when I'm old enough. -Yep.
look. I know love isn't a fairytale. -Really?
really.
did you have another girlfriend before you met her?
come on, tell me the truth.
I had two serious girlfriends.
and then some other, a smattering of other women that I dated.
you know.
what?
what's the boy word for slut?
they still haven't come up with one yet, but I'm sure they're working on it.
you a vegetarian this week or not?
Yeah, I am. -Great.
I'm guessing you weren't her first boyfriend.
maybe it was some nerdy guy, or maybe he was mean.
or maybe you were friends for the longest time, and then just when you were about to put your penis into somebody else's vagina...
okay. Good night, Maya.
...you realized Mom was the only one for you!
bedtime!
you still have to tell me the story of why you fell in love with her.
I fell in love with her because she was smart and beautiful and fun.
so now she's stupid and ugly and boring?
of course not. -Then what's the problem?
it's complicated, Maya. -Everything with you is so complicated.
I bet that if you just told me the story, you'd realize that it's not complicated at all.
that you just love her.
I know this is tough for you, but what are you thinking?
that I'm gonna tell you this story and it's gonna make everything better?
it doesn't work that way.
maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. Tell me and we'll find out.
no. Game over. It's time for bed.
no, it's not time for bed! It's time for you to tell me the story!
Maya. -I need to know!
I need to know.
fine! Fine!
I'm gonna tell you the story, -but I'm not telling you who your mom is. -Fine.
you're just gonna have to figure it out for yourself.
good. -And I'm changing all the names and some of the facts, but I just decided that right now.
and then we'll see how smart you are. -I like it. It's like a love story/mystery.
great. Sounds good. You ready? -No.
no.
take your time. -I will.
I know you will. -You go here.
princess pillow? -Thank you.
you bet. -Okay.
I'm ready.
once upon a time, before e-mails and cell phones and reality television shows, in 1992 to be exact, in a little town called Madison, Wisconsin, there lived a young man named William Hayes.
Hey, Will, man, Happy New Year. -Hey, yeah, you, too.
now, this young man was deeply, deeply in love with his college sweetheart.
let's call her...
Emily! -Emily!
Emily!
Hey. -Hi.
Hey, guess who's gonna be the luckiest guy on planet Earth in about four seconds?
you.
happy New Year!
they were a perfect couple.
except to really understand how this young man ended up marrying your mother, you'll also need to know that he had a very big, incredibly embarrassing dream.
all rise for the President of the United States of America,
william
Matthew
Hayes.
you wanted to be President?
I'm just, I don't understand why you have to work for Clinton in New York.
why can't you just work for him in Madison?
well, because they don't need me here. They need me in New York.
they need him, Em. Will's the man. I can't believe you're letting him go.
I mean, don't you know about New York girls?
besides being incredibly hot, they have no problem with casual sex, which by the way, I totally respect.
what if Charlie's right? -Charlie's never right.
he's functionally retarded. -I am worried New York's gonna change you.
change can be good. -If we change together.
so, we'll change together.
okay? It's two months in New York. I'll be back before you know it.
besides, we have a plan, right?
the other thing I can't believe is that you'd risk Ieaving Emily here with me, cause I gotta tell you, I've always had a thing for you...
and I have absolutely no scruples.
wait! I almost forgot. You have to give this to Summer.
she's the only girl I know in New York.
I want you to meet her. -Summer Hartley?
Yes. Yes. -That's her name?
she was on my exchange program at Cambridge, and all the guys wanted to sleep with her, and you probably will, too.
maybe you should mail it to her.
that might be a better idea. -No.
what is it?
something I should have sent her a long time ago.
I love you, William Hayes.
okay. Go, go, go. Go be your brilliant self.
Emily sounds like she would make a good mom.
I just don't know if she's my mom. - Why not?
everyone knows that the girlfriend in the beginning of the story always gets dumped.
which means maybe Summer Hartley is my mother.
I'll never forget that day.
there I was, arriving in the city I always dreamed about to work on a campaign that I believed in with all of my heart.
and on top of that, I was positive that in just a few hours, the campaign manager would realize how brilliant I was.
and then I'd be writing speeches, and then I'd be coming up with strategy, and before long...
GARETH: Will Hayes?
Hey. Gareth Henderson. -You're Gareth.
Hey, how are you? -Nice to meet you. We're walking, Hayes.
I brought my C. V. and a sample of some speeches I wrote for Congressman Sweeney.
fantastic. I cannot wait to peruse these in my abundant spare time.
in the meantime, here's a sample of the coffee and bagel order
I'll need filled immediately.
wait!
you want me to get coffee?
at some point in our lives, we all get coffee. Your time's now. Come on.
we're still walking, Hayes.
have the coffee here by 10: 00, or Arthur's gonna kill me!
that means I'm gonna have to kill you. I've killed before, Hayes.
you should know that. -What is this?
that is a cellular telephone so I can get a hold of you wherever, whenever, for whatever.
can somebody get me an aspirin, please? -Watch it!
glad to have you aboard, Hayes!
Hi. -What? Hi.
Arthur: Four weeks from now, voters of New York State will select their next Democratic nominee for President.
now, if Bill Clinton wins,
I want you to all understand that it's gonna be as a direct result of the commitment and the energy of every person in this room.
and I mean that. That's just a fact.
now, that's how important the work is.
that each and every one of you is...
what am I doing here?
it's the new guy.
Hey. -Hey, is that the toilet paper guy?
can I get a pack of Morley Red, please? -3. 25.
3. 25? These are $2. 15 in Madison, Wisconsin.
so go back to Madison.
don't forget to write. -That's right. Don't forget to write.
hold it! Stop. Stop right there!
you smoked?
no. Yeah.
but I didn't mean to tell you that.
listen. I was young, and I was stupid, and I haven't smoked in years.
I promise you.
is there anything else you should tell me?
probably not.
can I get 10 copies? -Put them on the pile.
no, they're for Arthur. I need them like, 15 minutes ago.
so if you wouldn't mind...
you're the toilet paper guy.
wait. Who's that? That's April.
Yes. I am, in fact, the toilet paper guy, but feel free to call me the bagel-and-coffee guy.
or Todd in Accounting calls me Crystal, which I'm pretty sure is a girl's name.
how many copies? -Ten. Please.
these? -Yeah, both of those.
what made you become a Bill Clinton supporter?
I'm not. This is a money gig. I get paid 12 an hour, which is better than babysitting, which is what I've been doing way too much of.
you're a Democrat, right?
why does everyone have to be a Democrat or a Republican?
I'm struggling with the copy machine.
no, hold on. You're an Independent, aren't you?
I am nothing. Why am I obligated to be something?
why do I have to have an opinion about everything anyway?
I mean, really, what do I know about missile systems or Social Security, or the tax code?
what about civil rights or women's rights?
a woman's right to do what she wants with her body? What about that?
I do what I want with my body.
that's apathetic.
I'm not apathetic. -Yes, you are.
I'm not. I just know that these bozos you're working for, they don't care about anything more than their own ambitions.
that's absolutely not true.
you think this guy, Bill Clinton, is gonna make a huge difference?
I do. -He's gonna do what's already inevitable.
okay, that's where you're wrong. -Don't make me staple your head!
you're wrong. He's gonna make a difference with African Americans.
he's gonna make a difference with women. He gets women.
my God. -I mean, look at his record in Arkansas.
read his plans on health care. Read his plans on education.
okay, or don't. You know, yeah. -Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry. -I just fell asleep.
I'm really sorry. -Yeah. That's fine.
wake up to a new America.
I believe you. -This has been really interesting.
fine. You convinced me. You're nothing. -I'm nothing.
flowers ON TV: So I'm here to repeat in front of all of you...
Hey! Listen up! Look up, everybody!
Yes, I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years.
Hey, somebody turn it up.
for the past two years, I have lied to the press about our relationship to protect him.
the truth is, I loved him.
now he tells me to deny it.
well, I'm sick of all of the deceit, and I'm sick of all of the lies.
well, you're right about one thing. He certainly gets women.
this has been fun. Yeah. - Bye, toilet paper guy.
Bye, copy girl.
Oh, my God. It never ends.
they just keep playing it over and over and over again.
it's gonna bIow over. -Right.
peopIe don't really care about this stuff.
that's the thing. -What I don't understand,
I've heard Bush has a mistress.
everybody's talking about it, so why is it okay for him and not for Clinton?
she's trashy.
I mean, her hair alone is enough reason to go after Clinton.
big deal. Everyone has their weaknesses, you know?
those chubby redheads with the long, fake fingernails?
that's what Daddy likes. -That's just nasty.
Gareth, you are unfailingly repugnant.
Hey. That is a coincidence. I love women that say "unfailingly repugnant."
you know what I love?
I love long-haired brunettes with horn-rimmed glasses.
I have no idea why. They're like kryptonite to me.
I got that one, too.
I got a thing for guys who've got a thing for me.
you might wanna look at that. I'm gonna propose a toast.
I am fine with that.
to Bill and his weaknesses. -Yes.
to Bill. -To Bill.
Hello?
Hey! It's me!
is that Emily? -Is that Emily?
Hi, Emily! -Hi, Emily!
what's all that noise?
nothing. That's just a couple of idiots I work with making fun of me because they don't have a beautiful girlfriend that they're eternally devoted to!
you're drunk.
you're beautiful.
you're horny. -You might be right.
Emily? Come to New York.
you'll love it here. It's the energy, the people. It's amazing.
whoa, did you just say "energy"? Will, you did not just say "energy."
what?
you're never coming back.
Hey, come on, now. I just want you to come for a weekend.
you're right. I'm sorry.
did you call Summer?
no. I left her a message. She didn't get back to me.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah. I'm just really lonely here, and I miss you like crazy, and it's really hard.
Yeah. I know what you mean.
Hey. What are you doing up? - Mr. McCormack.
come on, you've been staring at that package for about a week now.
how was the rest of your evening? Successful, I take it.
Oh, my goodness. I'm in big trouble. I love this girl!
you know, that's usually a good thing.
it's hard enough to get elected the first black President without having Julia Roberts on your arm at the inauguration.
that is an impressive mental leap, Russ, going from a one-night stand to being sworn in as President.
open it.
I know you're dying to know what's inside.
just her name alone, Summer Hartley, is driving me...
look it! You got a tear right there! I see it.
come on through. You can do it.
thank you. Yes.
it's a diary. -Sweet Jesus. Let me see.
No! Stop! Stop right there. We're not gonna read this. We can't.
the boys' dorm is across the quad, their windows visible from ours.
the evenings are hot and sticky.
we are all half-dressed, pretending we can't be seen by the boys.
some of us are bold. My new friend "Emily is sweet "and embarrassed by it all, always waiting to see what I will do.
don't stop! This is good stuff. Where were you? Okay.
it's our last night, and the plan has been in place for days.
Emily and I are the last to leave, and as we reach the stairs, I grab Emily firmly by her wrist.
she looks up at me expectantly and I know what will happen next.
do you? -I think I have a pretty good idea.
Oh, my godness!
what are you doing? This is good stuff, man!
wait a minute.
is that your Emily?
good night, Russell!
she is a freak!
put the picture back!
Wow.
HAMPTON: Who is it? -Will Hayes. I called earlier.
HAMPTON: You a Jehovah's Witness?
no.
Christ, you're tall.
Hi.
come in. -Okay.
cIose the door behind you.
HAMPTON: Lock it!
summer said to hang tight. She'll be back. She wants you to wait.
what do you got in there? -I don't know. Are you Summer's father?
Yeah. I'm her daddy.
drink? -No. No. It's a little early for me.
early. You're fresh off the boat, aren't you?
so tell me about yourself. What's your deal? What do you aspire to?
what are your dreams? What are your fancies?
what do you want to be when you grow up?
sit down! -Okay.
what do you do now? You...
wait, don't tell me. You work for your daddy.
no. -No, don't tell me!
wall Street. No!
you kiss ass to some fancy uptown law firm.
actually... -No! I give up. What do you do?
I'm working for Bill Clinton. He's running for President.
no.
I know who Bill Clinton is.
Yeah, in fact, I know more about Bill Clinton than his own mother.
Really? -Yep.
what do you do? -What do I do?
I drink!
drink!
be a man.
there you go! Isn't that better?
swallow!
so tell me about Bill Clinton.
Hey. Wake up.
you want some aspirin?
you must be Will. -Hi.
I see you drank my boyfriend under the table.
he's not your father? - Is that what he told you?
he's my thesis advisor.
what else did he tell you?
he was telling me how to be a real man, as opposed to the sort of boy-man I seem to be. -Did you learn anything?
Yeah, there's a lot of drinking involved.
aIso cursing and fighting.
sex? -Yes.
although that's not what we real men call it.
what do you call it?
I have something for you. This is from Emily.
haven't talked to her in ages. -We'll be moving in together in the fall.
Oh, please! Daddy.
Oh, come on! No.
Oh, this is...
did you read this?
I didn't.
I read a page. -A page.
two pages at the most. -Two?
and the part about you and Emily touching each other and kissing.
Oh! That part, yeah. -Incredibly descriptive. I felt like I was there.
you're a great writer. I mean...
I think you should keep it. You should read it when you're lonely.
I can't. It's your diary, so I can't do that. -No, really, really. I just, I don't need it.
I've already got it memorized, so I'll just leave it on the table.
keep a hard copy. That might be nice for me.
I wonder why Emily gave it to you to give to me.
Hampton?
Hampton? -Are you gonna join us?
that's Hampton Roth. He's an incredible writer.
his book on the McGovern campaign is... -Yeah.
you... -Yeah. We do.
look, have you ever actually had sex with a sexagenarian?
I haven't. -Well, then you shouldn't really judge.
well, actually, I'm not judging. Look at you.
you're beautiful. You're sophisticated. You're a very talented writer.
thank you.
I mean, to please a woman like you, it would obviously take a...
real man. -Exactly.
hard to compete with that. -Well, unless you're the competitive type.
Yep, nice to meet you. -Yeah, it was great meeting you, too.
I feel horrible about taking the...
sorry.
I was just curious.
Hampton encourages me to cultivate my curiosity.
he says it's the key to being a good journalist.
Yeah.
HAMPTON: Summer! Daddy's hungry!
speak of the devil. Better go. Yeah. -Hmm.
HAMPTON: Where the hell are you?
okay, bye. -Bye.
Yeah, give us a call sometime. We should all go out for dinner.
I'd... Yeah, I'd love dinner.
Yeah. -HAMPTON: Hey!
are you gonna call her? -Are you insane?
well, what are you gonna do? -What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball. Emily and I have a future. We have a plan.
which may involve some type of threesome now.
or foursome if that old dude is still in the picture.
you're not helping.
I never should have opened that diary. It's like Pandora's hot, sexy box.
what's a threesome?
what? A threesome.
that's a game that adults play sometimes when they're bored.
whatever. So what happened with Emily?
nothing. I wanted to wait till she came for a visit, and then I decided to do something really dramatic.
it was just one week before the primary, and I had graduated from bagels and toilet paper to signs and bumper stickers.
Jesus! Mercy!
hold, please.
what am I doing here?
move over! Another foot! Go, another foot. Move over!
over, over, over!
just want to let everyone know that the new signs are ready.
they're looking good.
I wrote three speeches for Congressman Sweeney.
how's high school?
he's from Texas. His name's George Bush. But he is not the President.
instead, he's the eldest son of George and Barbara and considered a key political advisor of the White House.
bryant, well, you forgot to mention the Texas Rangers.
bryant: Oh, okay.
man, if this guy's smart, he'll go back to baseball.
no kidding. -Anybody see Hayes?
no. -No.
Hayes! Where is Hayes? Hayes!
is it true you graduated first of your class at Madison?
Yeah. -All right.
come on. We're walking. -We're walking.
here's a list of Madison graduates in the New York area.
these people earn 200 grand plus a year.
we have a $10, 000-a-plate fundraiser on Monday with 15 empty tables.
I can't have that, Hayes. I need you to sell five of them.
hold on. No more coffee, bagels?
we'll see how this goes, okay? -Gareth.
what? -Thank you. I'm really happy right now.
okay, Hayes. -Okay.
there's the desk. -Look at that. Yeah.
Yeah, that's funny, the toilet paper.
that's good because it's ironic.
Yeah, that's right, everybody. My desk.
right here, I got a desk, and I got a list.
and I have a phone. And this empty basket.
no, no, no, I really don't agree that the Governor has a character problem, Mrs. Perleman.
did you know that 50% of Americans believe that marijuana use should be legalized?
Hello?
no, no, no, he wasn't a draft dodger.
besides, did you know that the majority of Americans believe that the Vietnam War was just a terrible idea?
both legs.
wow, I am sorry. You must miss them.
Yes, I understand your concern, but I think you should remember that the Governor comes from a town called Hope.
and hope is exactly what he stands for, so...
no, no, I know it's corny, but I also think that sometimes corny is exactly what this country needs.
that would be wonderful. No, thank you.
two seats.
okay, great. Thank you, Mr. Bishop.
Yeah, the dinner's next Thursday.
Yes, when I spoke with Hillary this morning she said that she wanted to get to know our most important supporters.
no, I think you'd definitely enjoy meeting her.
Yeah.
an entire table? No, that is very possible.
I'll put you down for one table, then. That sounds great.
okay, I look forward to seeing you next Thursday.
okay, thank you.
I just sold an entire table for $50, 000.
that's my guy, Will. My guy.
all: Toilet paper guy! Toilet paper guy!
good evening, gentlemen. Pack of Reds, please.
3. 60. New tax and a new warning.
Christ.
tell us the truth, my friend.
did that Clinton inhale or not? -What does it matter?
that's like if your girlfriend catches you in bed with another woman, then you say, "But we didn't do it."
what, is that gonna matter to her? -Yeah, it does. Hi.
hello. -Pack of American Eagles, blue, please.
4. 25.
4. 25? You pay $4. 25 for a pack of cigarettes?
they don't put as many chemicals in them.
so those are healthy cigarettes. -Something like that.
so if there's not as many chemicals in them, they should cost less, not more, don't you think?
they put saltpeter in your cigarettes, which make them burn faster, which make you smoke more.
which means, at the end of the day, your cigarettes actually cost more, not less.
copy girl, what I think you're actually paying for is the picture of the eagle and the pretty pastel colors.
some reassuring idea about your lifestyle. The rest is pretty much crap.
you wanna bet? -Sure.
20 bucks. -I got 20 bucks.
easiest 20 bucks I ever made.
Really? -Yeah.
that's funny. In a minute, I'll have 40.
okay, we have to inhale at the same time for the same amount of time.
Yep. -Ready, steady, go.
it's my birthday today. -Happy birthday.
why aren't you out celebrating?
my boyfriend, Lucas, was taking me out for dinner and then to a party.
but at last minute, he gets a gig in Philly, which, of course, he takes 'cause...
truth is he's far more interested in being the next Kurt Cobain than being my boyfriend.
who's Kurt Cobain?
you're kidding me!
what?
smoke.
look at that. -Look at that.
all right. -No, come on.
the satisfaction of me being right and you being wrong is more than enough for me.
well, I never welsh on a bet, so I'll tell you what.
I'll take you out for dinner, for a birthday dinner.
what do you say? -Like a date?
no, I didn't mean it like that.
like an "I feel sorry for you because it's your birthday and you have no plans" dinner.
you know, one of those. -Well, I'll tell you what.
you can take me to this party I have to go to, because there's no way I can face going alone.
Yeah, I'm gonna go head over...
I think I'm a little out of my league here.
Yes, you are.
so Emily is what, like, your college sweetheart?
it's amazing how you do that. -What?
the way you take the simplest statement, and then you twist it with a completely negative connotation.
it's really, actually, impressive. I'm amazed. -I didn't mean to do that.
but I understand. I get it. -I actually think it's very sweet.
see, you did it again. -Really?
Yeah. -I don't even know I'm doing it.
it's probably hard for you to imagine a relationship based on mutual respect without even the slightest hint of whatever you call it, masochism.
well, if your deal with Emily is so gosh darn wonderful, then why don't you just marry her?
what's stopping you?
nothing.
Wow. -Wow.
she gets it tomorrow. I made a reservation at some fancy French restaurant on the Upper East Side.
Oh, my God. You're doing it in front of a room full of strangers?
Yeah, I am. What's wrong with that? -No, nothing. I think it shows confidence.
what are you gonna say?
I'm still working on it. I don't know. -Oh, you should work on it with me.
you should practice with me. I'm really good at that. I will be Emily.
I'm Emily, your college sweetheart. Is there something you wanted to ask me?
Emily... -Wait! You've got to get down on your knee.
no, I'm not getting down on my knee.
she'll like it. She'll like seeing you down on your knee.
I'm not getting down on my knee. -Such a mistake. Okay.
Emily. -Yes, William.
don't make me laugh. Emily, will you, marry me?
no. -Oh, my God.
well, what do you mean, "Will you, um, marry me?
I haven't seen you in weeks!
you don't look happy or excited about the prospect of our marriage!
you're asking me to give up my freedom, my joie de vivre for an institution that fails as often as it succeeds?
and why should I marry you, anyway? I mean, why do you wanna marry me?
besides some bourgeois desire to fulfill an ideal that society embeds in us from an early age to promote a consumer capitalist agenda?
Oh, my God!
you should've got on your knee! -Just shut up!
here.
I wanna marry you because you're the first person that I want to look at when I wake up in the morning and the only one I wanna kiss goodnight.
because the first time that I saw these hands,
I couldn't imagine not being abIe to hold them.
but mainly, when you love someone as much as I love you getting married is the only thing left to do.
so will you...
marry me?
definitely. Maybe.
I have to think about it.
walk me home?
do you want a cup of tea? -Yeah. I'd love one.
Hey.
how come you have so many copies of Jane Eyre?
it's a long story. -Really?
it seems to be about 300 pages or so.
seriously, why?
for my 13th birthday, I wanted a pair of gold stud earrings, and instead my dad bought me a hardcover copy of Jane Eyre.
and inside, he wrote a beautiful inscription, which I could care less about at the time seeing as I was so pissed about the earrings, which was tragic as it turned out 'cause it was the last present he ever gave me.
what do you mean?
he died three weeks later in a car accident.
Jesus. That's awful.
I'm sorry.
have you ever read it? -No.
I read it every year or two. Each time it's different.
it tells me different things.
anyhow, when I went away to college, my mom sold our house and somewhere along the way, Jane Eyre got lost.
now, every time I pass a second-hand bookstore,
I look for the copy that my dad bought me for my birthday.
I know I'll never find it.
it's stupid, but it's become this, like, weird superstitious little...
it's not stupid. -Thanks. Hobby.
what are all these?
Oh, these are the ones I found that have inscriptions.
with love and hopes and dreams of second chances. Alice.
what is this?
this is Kurt Cobain. This is Nirvana. Do you like it?
Yeah, I do.
you think it's ridiculous that I want to be a politician, don't you?
Yes. -Thank you.
no, no, I get the whole politician thing. It's easy to like you.
that's true. That's very true.
I just wonder if you want people to like you a little too much.
that's also true.
I should want them to hate me.
I'm gonna start working on that right away. You got any tips for me?
no, but you're off to a great start.
yeah? -I'm hating you already.
good.
what do you wanna be when you grow up?
I mean, you're too smart to be making Xeroxes -and babysitting. -No.
I don't know! -Whatever else you do.
I don't know, and I don't know how to know. You know?
you know what I really wanna do is I wanna go to all those places that I know nothing about.
I've been saving money.
but I can't even get it together to do that.
probably because I'm stuck in a rut with this guy.
you should dump him.
I know that's none of my business, but you're too good for him.
you are.
you know what's really cool? -I don't.
we can just sit here and we don't have to worry about -flirting or all the attraction stuff. All that stuff.
very cool.
Yeah.
I got to go.
dumbass!
Oh, God. - There he is!
told you he wouldn't be long. -Hi! I wanted to surprise you!
I took the red-eye! - That's incredible!
I was just telling Emily how Arthur sent you to Albany as part of the advance team.
advance team. - Yeah. How'd it go?
how'd it go? Man, it went great! -Great.
great. -Great.
are you okay? -Oh, yeah, I was just getting a little exercise.
I ran up the stairs. -Okay.
I'm going to the office. It's... Got a big day. Nice meeting you.
and you. -Okay.
okay.
good luck.
Hi. -Hi.
here. -Yeah.
Hey.
it's weird. Your tongue tastes different. -What?
it tastes different, your tongue.
that is weird. -It's not bad. It's just different.
maybe it's the tap water here.
or the pH balance... I don't know what I'm talking about.
told you New York was gonna change you.
could we maybe go for a walk? -Yeah.
just to get some air? -Yeah, you could see New York.
I would love that.
so, did I ever tell you... I was gonna...
Oh, sorry. No, go. -What?
I was gonna say, did I ever tell you about the day my dad proposed to my mom?
no.
well, Dad was on his way to meet my mom to propose, and he runs into his ex-girlfriend, Caroline Hopper.
and they're talking, they're looking at each other, and all these old feelings, they start coming up.
and he's thinking, "I could run away right now with Caroline Hopper, "be a happy man.
all I have to do is kiss her.
but instead, he looks up, and he sees my mom walking around the corner.
and that moment he knows that he had no reason to be afraid.
you understand?
am I Caroline Hopper in this story or your mom?
Oh, my God! I'm your mom!
Emily, when I saw you this morning... -Will, please.
... I knew... -Put that back in your pocket.
just stand up, Will. Stop. -...with absolute clarity.
wait, wait, wait. -I have no reason to be afraid.
let's think about this. -I'm not afraid of this.
it's just like the day that my...
will!
I slept with Charlie!
I thought we had a plan.
well, you had a plan, Will. You have a really big plan!
pretty sure we both had that plan. -I just can't keep pretending -that I want to be part of it anymore. -You were there -when we made it. -And I didn't know how to tell you.
how do you tell someone that you care about that you don't want the same things -they want anymore? -The best way?
definitely having sex with the roommate.
it was cowardly, and I'm sorry.
Oh, good.
you're killing me.
no, I'm not. I'm letting you go.
cause if we stay together, Will, we're gonna be miserable.
I'm gonna hold you back from all these...
that's not true. -...incredible dreams that you have.
and then, eventually, you're totally gonna hate me for it.
no. -Yes.
will, I don't want that, and you don't want that.
trust me.
you're gonna be just fine, Mr. Hayes, without me.
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.
announcer: Here is Tom Brokaw in New York.
good evening. Bill Clinton may have been wounded in New York, but the big question tonight is, to what degree?
because, after all, he is the big survivor, indeed, the victor in the New York primary and by a comfortable margin.
women: Goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
sometimes it's all a big surprise 'Cause there was a time when all I did
Hey.
Congratulations.
I hear they asked you to stay on. You must be very happy.
Yeah, yeah, he did, and I am. Very, very happy.
Really? Why do I feel like I should hide the razor blades?
and the staplers and those scissors?
I'll be fine. But this song, it's an excellent cure for the will to live.
I know. What about the dancing? Make that end.
I'm sorry about the other night.
it's okay. I just didn't think that Lucas would approve.
or Emily, for that matter. - Well.
besides, you and me, it'd kind of be like cats and dogs.
Yeah. Yeah.
oil and water. -Sandpaper and bare ass.
that's gross. That's just gross. -You'd be the ass.
Yeah. No, thank you.
I'd be honored. -Lennon and McCartney.
they were good together. -Yeah, while it lasted, and then they couldn't even be friends.
I think we can, at least, manage that. -I think we could.
enchant. -Yeah. Salud.
come on, let's dance. -No.
Why? -Okay.
you ready? Yeah.
guess that's it for Emily.
I can't believe that she rehearsed with Charlie.
I can't believe it, either. -That leaves April. Maybe Summer.
anybody else? -I was too busy.
I was too busy working on the campaign.
anyway, when Clinton got elected,
Russell and I started our own consulting firm, and we worked on campaigns for everybody.
city council, state senate.
we even did one for the local dog catcher.
that's very interesting, Dad, but what about girlfriends?
what about Mom? -Well, I started dating again.
but nothing serious. -What about April? What happened to her?
well, a week after Kurt Cobain died, she broke up with her boyfriend.
she went traveling.
she traveled all over the world, just like she always dreamed of doing.
and she says that it was because of something that I said to her on her birthday.
anyway, we started writing postcards. We started writing letters.
and before I knew it, even though we were separated by entire worlds, we became great friends.
it was 1994, and New York was full of new life.
more jobs, more money.
that was the start of the Internet. And overnight, everyone in Manhattan had a cell phone.
can you hear me now?
which they never put down.
and then, our old boss, Arthur Robredo gave Russell and me our first big break.
this just came for you. -Thanks.
I had finally made it inside the room.
Gareth. -Hayes.
good morning.
Hey, let's get this party started.
what's the word from upstate?
for the first time, New York was coming to me, instead of the other way around.
the most endangered species in our nation "isn't a big woodpecker or some freshwater fish.
it's the tongue in our heads!
listen to the truncated bastard language of today.
the average vocabulary is a third of what it was 100 years ago.
words fall out of our mouths and die at our feet!
the landscape of vocabulary is being hacked down "and grubbed up by the dribble of pop culture, "poisoned by lazy obscenity...
will?
HAMPTON: ..."infantilized by a youth-obsessed media..."
Hey. -Hey.
it's my favorite man-boy. You look very manly.
well, thank you, thank you. That's the aim.
how's Emily? -Emily.
she's starring in somebody else's diary now.
how's the Professor? -The Professor is wonderful.
he's funny. -He dumped me for a sophomore.
told me it was for my own good.
everybody seems to be using that line these days.
what have you been up to?
I'm writing these really dumb items for New York Magazine.
waiting for my big break.
and 'syntax' isn't what Nevada brothels pay the IRS.
I'm gonna go listen to the Professor. -Sure.
nice glasses.
HAMPTON: "Listen to your kids if you can."
thank you. Scotch, rocks, please.
william Hayes!
from... Don't tell me!
Wisconsin! Yes, the Cheese State.
very nice of you to come to our little shindig.
I'll have another, please. -PIeasure.
Yeah. Summer tells me you're writing speeches now for Arthur Robredo?
she tells me you're dating a sophomore. -No. Actually, it's two freshmen, which, on a good day, add up to a sophomore, I suppose.
waIk with me. Why would you wanna work for a hack like Arthur Robredo?
as I recall from our first encounter, you're a man of principles and ideals, even.
don't tell me you're just another yuppie puppy in an Armani suit.
you were wonderful, darling. Is he being nice? You being nice?
nice? Yeah, he can handle himself. -Sure, I can handle myself.
first of all, Arthur Robredo is not a hack. He's worked his way up from the streets.
he was a cop, an entrepreneur.
he's a putz. This is exactly what my book is about.
here. Read it. It's free.
beauty, ideals, love don't mean squat anymore.
it's all about power and money. -I've read every single one of your books, and you're completely obsessed with power and money.
that's because he doesn't have any. Right, babe?
babe, I am about the love.
as you know. -Yes.
that's why you keep me around.
to keep that rampant, rapacious ambition of yours in check.
I have a thought.
why don't you use that newly acquired scintilla of power and influence to get Summer here to write an article about your man Robredo?
that way Summer gets a break, and you get the word out.
what do you get, Hampton? -Yeah.
I guess it's the love. More of the love. Yeah, that's what I'm about.
more love.
I knew Summer would be back. -Did you?
you know what? At first, I didn't want Summer to be my mom.
but now I'm kinda liking her. Did you ask her out on a date?
I wanted to, but I couldn't 'cause she was writing the article.
Wow. This is pretty good. -Will, this is really good.
summer: Are you sure it didn't seem like a puff piece?
no, it's perfect. It's absolutely...
you know, there's one part, though, that kind of bothered me.
william Hayes, Robredo's chief speech writer, is both intense and boyishly handsome.
Boyishly? I mean... -Yeah.
you know, I originally wrote, "William Hayes has seductive eyes and the intriguing looks of someone "whose clothes you wanna rip from his very body,
but the editor made me change it.
there's just no room for truth in journalism.
did you always want to be a journalist?
no. Until I was 16, I wanted to be an actress. I wanted to sing on Broadway.
Wow. Really?
Yeah, really. Is that hard to believe?
well, aren't actresses needy and emotional and, you know, insecure?
that sort of thing.
what are you saying? That I don't need? That I don't have emotions?
I'm an incredibly needy person. -I'm not saying that.
I'm a very needy person. -You know what I'm saying?
I'm saying I would love to hear a song.
I'm sorry? -Give us a song.
you want me to sing you a song? -Why not?
you have a favorite? -Yes.
you do? -Yeah.
okay.
how glad the many millions
of Timothys and Williams would be -I'm a William. -Don't interrupt.
to capture me
but you had such persistence
you wore down my resistance
I fell
and it was swell
it's not that you're attractive
Wow.
will you please put it on?
you know, it really isn't so bad.
you know what the funny part is? It's $1, 000.
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
Frank Sinatra, Linda Ronstadt.
Why? A whole bunch of these.
well, if you look on the back, they all have one common song, which is...
I've Got A Crush On You. -Every one of them.
how's it going? -Still got a lot to do.
Yeah, me, too.
Yeah, I'm about done. -Yeah, me, too.
the world will pardon my mush 'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on...
was I snoring?
you know what I've never done?
what?
I've never spent the whole day in bed with a really great guy.
me, neither.
I'm serious.
I always think of something more important to do.
I'm a workaholic.
it's really bad.
will you spend the whole day in bed with me?
we do nothing.
Hi, this is Summer. Please leave a message, and I will call you back.
this is Dr. Levenstein from the Columbia Presbyterian emergency room. We have...
emergency room? Hello?
Mr. Roth has had an aortal rupture. -What does that mean exactly?
think of it like a tire blowing out on the highway after going too fast for way too long.
how's that, Mr. Roth? Are you comfortable?
I make a living.
come on, sweetheart, give me a smile. I've waited my whole life to do that joke.
poor Hampton.
summer's come.
what's he doing here? -Hello, Hampton.
hello.
one thing they've left intact.
no, no, no, no, no, no, don't mention grassroots.
don't mention osmosis.
it's killing me that you're going out with the kid.
Really? It's not the booze or the cigarettes or the sophomores?
that has nothing to do with this. -Nothing to do with it.
listen, I want you to know I've donated my organs to medical science except for one, which is for you.
sweetie, that's so kind. -No, no, not that.
my heart, stupid.
please tell me you're not in love with him.
I can't do that.
can I have a cigarette? Just a dying man's last request.
not happening. God, you're such a drama queen.
nobody's dying.
what do you care if I'm in love with him, huh?
you're the one who set us up, remember?
Yeah, well, I kind of figured you'd chew him up and spit him out.
you're such a sweetie. You're a sweet guy, you know that?
I read the Robredo piece. -Yeah.
the guy's been in New York politics for over 20 years and all you can dig up is that his daughter had an eating disorder?
what are you saying, Hampton?
do your job.
I can't believe we're finally gonna meet the President.
look at that. -Look at it.
we've come a long way from that hotel room on 8th Avenue.
thank you very much.
GARETH: I don't believe it! I don't believe it!
which idiot forgot to check the menus and the programmes?
there's no union seal on the menus or the programmes.
are you serious?
the hotel workers won't let anybody into the building.
the Teamsters won't set up the satellite feed!
has anyone seen Robert Klein?
I was with him like an hour ago. Now he's gone.
I think he was completely plastered.
how are we supposed to know where Robert Klein is?
you're not gonna believe this, but there's a hailstorm in Chicago.
who cares about Chicago?
we do. The President's coming in from Chicago.
okay, okay. -We can't worry about that right now.
let me ask you a question. How could you let this happen?
what? What are you talking about? -Why are you jumping down her throat?
whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys, guys, guys, guys, hey!
Hey, deep breath, okay? Look, let's just ask the hotel, see if we can use the Internet connection and find a printer.
I'll call Klein's agent. -Great.
Gareth, have a drink.
you, I don't know who you are, but your fly's down.
be great if you wore underwear. I'm gonna go check the weather in Chicago.
table seven's up. Six pasta. Two fish. Get it out the door, now!
he may not be in your union, but he still happens to be the President of the United States.
remember him? So if I was you, -I'd get your men off that truck and in this... -Gareth!
you can't talk to a Teamster like that! Come on.
this guy... -Everything's gonna be fine.
look, look, check it out.
I downloaded a copy of the union seal.
if you could just please paste it onto a menu, make 500 copies, use a union shop. We're gonna be home free, here.
copies? You want me to make copies?
well, at some point, we all make copies. Your time is now.
that's not funny, Hayes. That's very...
Yeah, that's real mature. Where are you going?
I'm walking! Back in half an hour.
what a dick.
Yeah. -William Hayes?
speaking.
I'm watching you right now.
and I know all about you and your friend Robredo.
in fact, I know so much, I could bring you both down.
Really?
who am I speaking with? -Why don't we meet, and you'll find out?
where are you? -I'm close by.
I don't have a lot of experience with whatever this is.
you're getting warm.
you're hot.
you are so hot!
I got you!
I thought you were gone through the summer.
no, I thought so, too, but this crazy thing happened.
I mean, I was camping on this beautiful beach in Crete with all these really cool people, and there was this guy that I liked, Paco, brooding and sexy, monosyllabic and totally my type.
one night I'm dancing with Paco and he kisses me, -an incredible, deep kiss. - Spare me the details.
and what do I do? -I don't know. What'd you do?
I start crying.
I mean, tears are rolling down my cheeks... -Of course you start crying.
...which he doesn't notice 'cause, of course, his hands are all over my body, which felt nice, which made me feel even more upset, 'cause in a flash
I saw our entire relationship, from present to future tense.
I mean, the incredibly hot start, with Paco basking in my love and admiration...
what are we doing here? -I just got to pick something up.
just take a second.
and then the inevitable moment, and I don't know why it...
hello. -Hi.
I don't know why it happens, but it always does, when all that love and admiration would start to irritate him and he'd find some way to hurt me.
I mean, sure, after, he'd be sorry.
so...
I decided to unlock his beautiful lips from mine, remove his hand from my ass, -and I walked away. -Good move.
I walked away, Will! From Paco! -Good move.
no one walks away from Paco! -I like the story.
and it felt life-changing.
and I realized I had to tell someone.
when I realized who that person was, -it was so unexpected. - Here we are, sir.
it's like when something is staring you in the face and it's like you're too blind to see it.
what's that?
I have some news for you, too.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you so upset?
don't you think it's a little weird we've been writing each other for however long and somehow you neglect to tell me that,
a, you've fallen in love, and, B, you've fallen in love!
I told you I was dating someone. -Dating someone.
you just bought a diamond engagement ring for someone!
I'm sorry. I think I was just nervous to tell you.
why would you be nervous to tell me?
I don't know.
I love this girl so much.
I'd just really like you to be happy for me.
I can be happy for you. Of course I can be happy for you.
poor April.
she's like the character in the story who's always been the friend.
then she realized she doesn't just want to be the friend.
she wants to be the girlfriend, except it's too late.
what do you mean?
weren't you listening? She came home for you.
GARETH: There's union seals on all the menus, my friend.
the weather cleared in Chicago. The President will be here by 8: 00.
Where's Russ?
gonna meet you and Arthur in the restaurant.
robert KLEIN: I'm funnier over here.
I can't stop my leg.
you're early.
good to see you.
you look great. -Thank you. You, too.
that's a nice tie. -Well, you'd know.
so, the magazine asked me to do a follow-up on Robredo.
great. -Yeah, it is great. It's also...
it's...
you just read it.
you already wrote it. -Yeah.
he did this? -Yes.
they actually got a friend an early parole.
you know what? I think it happened such a long time ago, and you're way ahead in all the polls.
Yeah, see, I don't think that's gonna matter, because he's the tough-on-crime Democrat.
that's...
when people read this...
summer, listen to me.
if you hand this in, we won't survive it.
I think it'll be a big deal for about a week, and then the storm will pass...
I'm talking about you and me.
candidate Brought Down by Speechwriter's GirIfriend.
come on. -I'm just doing my job.
I didn't do it the first time around.
and if I didn't write this, somebody else would.
let them.
Hey, don't hand this in, okay?
you already did.
Mr. Arthur...
Arthur: Yeah, sure.
I really liked Summer.
I can't believe she turned out to be such a...
heartbreaker? -No.
opportunist? Double-crossing... -Uh-uh.
bitch. -Maya.
how could she do that to you?
it's like she said. If she didn't write it, someone else would have.
and it was the truth.
so did she? Did she break it?
what?
what happened when the article came out?
you screwed up, man. You really screwed up.
please save it. I don't need to hear this right now.
whenever I figure out whatever I'm supposed to learn from all this, -I'll write you a letter! -Yeah, can't wait.
so I lost my girl, I lost my job, and I lost my friend.
and for a long time, nothing seemed to matter.
but I wasn't the only one with problems.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman,
miss Lewinsky.
I never told anybody to lie.
Hello? -Are you watching?
these allegations are false.
April?
Yeah, April. Who'd you think it was? Are you watching or not?
of course I'm watching.
you think he did it, don't you?
I don't think, I know. Look at the picture of her. I love her.
she's so his type.
so, what took you so long to finally call me back there, red?
I thought I lost you.
feels like years. -I'm calling you now, aren't I?
Yeah.
how are you? What's doing?
I got a new roommate, Olivia.
and I'm working at a bookstore.
but I've been thinking about going back to school.
cool.
Hey, did I tell you that I hate my job?
I used to love what I do, and now I feel like a complete hack.
are you seeing anyone? -Me? Am I... No, no. Absolutely not.
in fact, I haven't had sex since Clinton was re-elected.
why bother? He's having enough sex for the entire country.
easy. Easy now.
Hey, maybe you should follow his lead and seduce an intern.
you know, it's funny that you should mention that.
there's a fetching young intern who just started a week ago.
great. Ask her out.
I should, shouldn't I?
but I don't think I will. You see, I don't want a fling.
I want the real deal.
forget about the real deal. You don't find it, it finds you.
what does that mean? I don't know what that means.
it means that you get to a certain age and then you're ready.
you know, you're ready for kids or a commitment or, you know...
sir. -...a mortgage.
table's ready. Okay. -Thanks.
you know what I mean?
and the person that you're with then, they become the one.
so you're saying it's not who, but it's when.
exactly. -Okay. All right.
so there's never been a guy, ever, that made you think, "This is it.
this is him. This is the one.
no.
okay, then why aren't you out there, you know, enjoying yourself?
I am.
you are? -Yes.
right now I'm seeing this guy, Kevin.
Kevin. -Kevin.
who the hell's Kevin?
where did... How come you never, you know, mentioned anything about him?
I'm mentioning him now.
Oh, God! They have fresh mint tea. I love fresh mint tea.
I love beer.
it depends upon what the meaning of the word "is" is.
if it means "there is none" that is a completely true statement.
Hey, this is April.
I want to talk to you about your birthday. Call me.
hello. I hope this is the right number. It sounds like you.
it's Emily!
I'm in New York, and I was thinking maybe we could get a cup of coffee and catch up.
my number...
Hey, it's April. I still need to talk to you. Please call me back.
I mean, don't make me come over there and hurt you.
okay, I'm coming!
God, I'm coming.
Yeah, I get it.
what are you doing in there?
is this what you're wearing? -What?
it's your birthday party. Everybody is waiting for you.
Oh, Christ.
five minutes, okay? Five...
I'm down. -Are you okay?
Yeah. I just need to lie here for a sec.
I see you've been eating noodles.
Hey, everybody, he's here!
Thanks.
Hi.
Oh, my God! I didn't think you'd be here!
I couldn't miss your birthday. We came all the way up from Washington.
happy birthday, gorgeous.
that is a beautiful woman right there.
you had your chance, pal.
Hayes.
come on.
it's great to see you. -Yeah. You look...
homeless, I know.
Where's Kelly? -She's right over there.
it's her first night out since the baby was born.
Congratulations.
iran-contra. Arms for oil, no problem.
but a little "oralness" and you're headed for impeachment.
no politics! -Maybe he should be impeached.
whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! Did he say that?
why not? I put my faith in him. We all did. -You love him.
I thought he was gonna be different than the other jokers, but this guy, he can't even define the word "is."
what happens if they give him one of the hard words, like "truth"?
I'd vote for him again. -In a heartbeat.
will's a lot of fun.
Yeah, let's fill up the tub and drop in a toaster.
that should be a good time.
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday, dear Will. -Where is he? Where's Will? -I don't know. I was just talking to him.
you missed your birthday cake.
and I baked it. -You baked it.
do you remember that song?
in your apartment?
come as you are, as a friend
as a known enemy -"Memory," not "enemy." -I know, I know, I know.
somebody had too much to drink. -No, I didn't.
I didn't, I didn't. I didn't.
Yes, you did. -I did.
God, you're beautiful. -Thank you.
what?
the thing is...
the thing is...
is that I like you.
I've always liked you.
like.
that's pathetic. It's so puny.
"love" on the other hand...
you'd run away from a word like that.
I love you.
I'm in love with you, April.
why didn't you ever tell me? -Come on.
you know exactly why I never told you. You'd never be interested in me.
you're an idiot.
stop. -What?
not like this. -Like what?
look at you, Will, you're a mess.
why couldn't you have told me when you had your shit together?
my shit is together. -Your shit is a mess.
you're a mess.
my shit is a mess?
that's interesting, coming from you, April.
you could do anything on earth, and you work in a bookstore.
what's that all about?
at least I tried. I went out there and I tried.
look, I'm just saying this as a friend, and I swear, it's just as a friend, but maybe you should go out there and, you know, get some help.
go to rehab or life rehab or something like that.
I don't even know if they have that sort of thing, but if they did...
okay.
...you know, you could be a prime candidate for that.
I should go to "life rehab"? -Yeah.
get off my front porch!
April?
you're right.
it is complicated, isn't it?
I mean, you're in love with April, who used to be in love with Lucas, and then she fell in love with you, but you were in love with Summer, who was always really in love with Hampton.
and now that you're in love with April, she's in love with Kevin.
and no one's in love with you.
that's complicated.
Yep.
then what happened?
Jane Eyre, Random House, 1943.
it's a beautiful edition, known for the cover illustration.
but there's a really nice dedication inside, with a quote from the book.
to my darling daughter, April. 'The human heart has hidden treasures' -'In secret kept, in silence sealed...' -'In silence sealed 'The thoughts, the hopes the dreams, the pleasures 'Whose charms were broken if revealed'
from your loving father.
Hi, Olivia. -Hi, Will.
how you been? -Good.
I haven't heard any of your long sorry messages in a while.
those were delightful, weren't they? Sorry about that.
april here? -No, she's at school.
school? -Yeah.
she started grad school at NYU. -Great. Wow.
if you want to wait, she'll be home soon. -I'd love to.
make yourself comfortable. I have to finish this application I'm writing.
good luck. -Thanks.
Hey.
how you doing?
Kevin.
will Hayes.
I'm just waiting for April.
are you the same Kevin that she mentioned a while back?
I hope so. Unless she's collecting Kevins.
Olivia: Kevin, phone!
anyway, I'm pretty sure I am the only Kevin who's actually living with her.
do you know what you want yet?
no. -WAITRESS: No?
will?
william Hayes?
God.
it is! -Summer.
you look beautiful.
believe it or not, I've been meaning to call you.
I'm pregnant. -You're what?
Really? -Can you believe it?
please, sit. Congratulations. -Thanks. Thanks.
who's the lucky guy?
Sam Knowles. -Okay.
but he's basically out of the picture.
he didn't make the cut, huh? -Yeah.
well, I don't need a guy. I never really did.
you were about the closest I ever got.
no, really, when I was with you, I thought, "This is it."
but I screwed it up.
no, you didn't. -I did. I so did.
listen,
I'm having a little party Sunday.
I want you to come. -Oh, boy.
1899/12/31 0: 04: 00
will you come? Please?
you know, I'll see if I can make it.
I really want you to. -I'll make it.
I want to make amends with anyone I ever hurt.
and I figure it'll take about nine months, which is perfect timing.
and she's off. Bye. -Bye-bye.
william Hayes.
dad, maybe this wasn't such a good idea. - What?
telling me this story, this mystery love story.
what if I don't like who my mom is? -Of course you'll like who your mom is.
and you don't have to wait long to find out, because that very night...
it's Summer, isn't it? And you're not my father.
no wonder you didn't want to be with her.
take it easy, Maya. It's just a story.
and this one has a happy ending.
how does it have a happy ending?
you and my mom, whoever she is, you're getting divorced.
what's the happy in that?
okay, you know what? I think we should stop now.
No!
then how about a nice cup of tea?
if you want, I'll still continue with the story. Does that sound good?
Maya? -Okay.
dad?
I can't believe you smoked and drank and were such a slut.
but I still love you.
Thanks.
all right. All right.
no, no. Don't eat it yet! Not till we get to our bench.
you're in a good mood.
well, I think I discovered who my mom is in the story.
Really? -Really.
well, who is it? -Not telling.
so the last time we saw William Hayes, he had just discovered that the woman he truly loved, April Hoffman, was in love with another man.
I know. Shocking.
meanwhile, he accepted an invitation to the home of his ex-girlfriend, Summer Hartley, who, if she does turn out to be my mother, I'm running away to Canada.
I'm not kidding.
he died last year. -Yeah.
you heard? -I read about it in The Times.
Yeah. -Yeah.
God. Died in his office. Heart attack? -Yeah.
I always imagined that he'd make a more theatrical exit.
what they didn't say was he was on the couch with the dean's daughter.
Jesus. -I'm kidding.
actually, he was completely alone and it was hours before the janitor found him.
you want a drink? -I'm sorry.
you must miss him. -I do, yeah.
these are for you.
Oh, Will. -Yeah.
they're beautiful.
so are you.
summer. -Will.
don't mess with me.
I can see where you're going with this.
in a second, you're gonna say something impossibly charming.
Really? -Yeah. It's gonna be great.
and then you're gonna sweep me off my feet and we all know where that's going.
can't a girl miss a guy? -And you know that's gonna end badly.
Yeah, she can, but I just don't really have time for the pain.
so let's just skip all that, why don't we? -Okay.
fair enough.
can we be friends?
Yeah! Yeah. -Yeah.
shake on it? Okay. -Let's do that. All right.
you know what?
there's someone here I want you to meet.
Yeah. Come with me.
they're an old flame of mine, and I think you guys are really gonna, you know, hit it off.
Emily.
I'm gonna put these in some water.
you look... -You look...
you look great.
why are you in New York? -I live here.
I took a job with the city education department.
I called you. -I know.
I've been meaning to call you back. -Liar.
I had lost your number. -Of course.
no, it's true. You know what? -Will...
okay, give me your number, right now.
I'm gonna put it in my cell phone, and that way I'm never gonna lose it, okay?
my number is 212-664-7665.
six, six, five. See? Now I got it. And I'm never gonna lose it again.
Oh, no, go ahead, go ahead. -Sorry.
hello. -Hey, it's Will.
I'm really sorry I lost your number.
I just had the weirdest flash of a whole life, one that never, ever happened.
what did happen to us?
you slept with my roommate. -Oh!
I'm sorry.
if I remember correctly, I believe it was my "plan," wasn't it?
the plan. Remember that? -Yes, the plan.
who talks like that?
no, it wasn't the plan. I was scared of you and your dreams, and then after we broke up, I just felt lost.
I still feel pretty lost, especially when it comes to relationships.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've been... Me, too.
did you ever think that maybe we just needed a different plan?
wait! Stop! Stop right there. Now, go back.
okay, stop. Now go forward, slowly.
now here it comes.
there! Right there!
that's it! That's how I figured it out!
that's what Mom does when I'm upset.
she fluffs up my hair and tells me to be brilliant or shine like the sun, and it always makes me feel better.
sounds like a great mom. -She is a great mom.
so you're absolutely positive, 100%, that Emily is the very same woman walking toward us right now?
Absolutely.
is it?
mom! Mom! -Hey!
I'm so glad it's you.
well, who else would it be? -Nobody.
good morning, Will. -Hey, Sarah.
mom, can Dad come with us to the zoo?
Yeah, if Dad wants to come, sure.
you know, I love the zoo. Let's go to the zoo.
guess what, Mom? - What?
we learned all about sexual intercourse at school yesterday.
Really? -Really.
really.
I love penguins.
me, too.
me, three.
did you know that penguins mate for life?
although, Mr. Monell told us that sometimes the husband and wife penguins get separated 'cause of their migraine patterns.
migratory. -Migratory.
well, sometimes they're apart for years, but they almost always find each other.
do you know what the husband and wife penguins do after they find each other after all that time?
throw back their heads, flap their flippers and sing as loud as they can!
okay. All right, munchkin. Let's go!
Hey, monster, that was fun today. I'll see you on Wednesday, okay?
see you later.
dad!
thanks for telling me the story. -You're welcome.
I forgot to tell you the happy ending. -What is it?
you.
Hey, I love you. -I love you, too.
go catch up to your mom, okay? All right, bye.
are you all right?
yeah?
Mr. President! Hey, Mr. President!
will Hayes, I worked on the '92 campaign.
Hi. I'm looking for April.
check that they have legal representation, okay?
right. -Thanks, John.
I can't believe you're doing this.
this is great. -Thanks.
still smoking? -I quit.
me, too. Still live in the same loft? -Living in Brooklyn.
aIways on the cutting edge.
dating? -Not at present. You?
I got divorced. -I know.
I heard. I'm so sorry.
Why?
you always said marriage was overrated.
Yeah, and you never listened to me. You were always with the rings.
is that why you and Kevin never... -Oh, God, Kevin. No. Kevin...
something always seemed to be missing with Kevin.
I don't know.
it's weird. It was never quite right. You know?
Yeah.
it's good to see you. -You, too.
I have something for you.
thank you so much.
how did you find it? I mean, where did you find it?
that's the difficult part to explain.
this is gonna sound bad.
I've had it for a while.
how long?
years.
many years.
I meant to...
I meant to give it to you. I wanted to give it to you.
I just...
I couldn't. And I don't know why.
I dropped it off once. I mean, I tried. Kevin was there and...
Hey, there is no excuse, and I'm sorry.
it's inexcusable.
I think you should go, Will. -April?
I think you should go.
you never gave it to her? After all that time?
I know. I know. -But it was from her dad.
I know. I know.
and then you just left?
Yep.
how come you changed all the names except hers?
what do you mean?
in the story, you know, like Mom became Emily, and Summer's that Natasha lady who writes for that magazine.
but you didn't change April's name. Why?
why are you so concerned with all of this anyway?
because I want you to be happy.
you know,
I'm happy.
trust me, Dad. You're not happy.
put your coat on.
Taxi! -Taxi!
she said something was missing with Kevin, which means it might not be missing with you, -which is good news, right? -CouId be.
couId be.
did you know that 35 people try to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge each year?
most because of broken hearts.
I'll keep that in mind.
hello. -Hey. Hi.
it's me, Will.
April?
what are you doing here?
go on, tell her.
who's that?
that would be my daughter, Maya.
that's kind of cheating, isn't it? Bringing your daughter?
what am I supposed to do now?
well, you could let us in.
I think you're wrong.
come on, let's go. Let's go.
a little while longer. She's going to let us in.
okay, kiddo, here's the deal.
I'm gonna count to 30, okay?
and if she doesn't let us in, we're gonna go home, and we're never gonna talk about this again.
deaI? -Yeah.
ready?
if she lets us in, tell her the story like you told me.
and then she'll know. - Know what?
I can't explain. She'll just know.
twenty-nine and a quarter.
twenty-nine and a half.
twenty-nine and three-quarters.
what comes after that?
time to go.
but this wasn't what was supposed to have happened.
I know. -I really thought she would have heard through the intercom and let us in, or run down the stairs and say...
what story?
I kept the book... -Yeah?
...because it was the only thing that I had left of you.
you must be Maya. -You must be April.
so what happens now?
you invite us inside, and we tell you the story.
okay.
can I get you to sign right here, please? - Okay. Here you go.
Thanks. -You're welcome.
Hi, Will. Package for you.
I don't think anyone ever imagines on their wedding day be part of the 46% that doesn't live happily ever after.
will?
just heard we got the Quaker Oats account.
way to go. You must be completely psyched.
then again,
I never thought I'd spend my days, weeks and years working in an advertising agency trying to figure out how to get kids to eat Cap'n Crunch instead of Froot Loops.
but Tuesdays and Fridays are my favorite days.
I get out of work early, and I go pick up my daughter, Maya, from school.
now, it's a great feeling when you find the right track to go with the day.
and today, I have found the absolute perfect song.
bitches, they can kiss my...
the other perfect song.
thank you.
you're welcome.
but sometimes, no matter how carefully you plan your playlist, there is no right track for what awaits you.
come on, come on! -Hey, what's going on?
will, did you know there was gonna be a sexed class today?
aren't they kind of young?
Yeah! It was a total disaster. -At least it got them reading.
there's a book!
the 250 million sperm are ejaculated and begin their treacherous journey towards the fallopian tubes!
one hundred million are wiped out instantly...
I'm gonna find Maya.
GlRL: Do you still have sex with Daddy?
what are you talking about? -Do you?
you know, we will go home and talk... -You do, don't you?
we will go home and talk about this. -GlRL: I hate you, I hate you!
stop pulling on me! I am trying to get to the bottom of something!
we need to talk.
which is when the man removes his penis from his pajamas and thrusts it into a woman's vagina...
okay, but Mrs. Gallagher didn't actually say "thrust."
Yeah. -Oh.
but what I don't understand,
Sammy Boigon's sister said he was an accident.
I mean, how do you accidentally thrust a penis into... Hi, Luis.
Hey. -How do you accidentally...
stop saying "penis" and "thrust." Just say "tinkle part" or "wee-wee."
something cute.
explain how Sammy was an accident. -That's complicated.
penis! Penis. -Okay. All right, that's enough.
okay, they...
it's not like his dad slipped on a banana peel.
the accident was that Sammy's mom got pregnant.
if they didn't want a baby, then how come they had sex?
that's a very good question.
I guess you could say that they were rehearsing.
was I an accident? -No.
I was, wasn't I? -No.
you were completely and totally on purpose. I knew exactly what I was getting into.
I think you should tell me the story of you and my mom.
why do you keep saying "my mom" like I've never met her?
well, because now that you're getting divorced, she's mine, not yours.
is that so? -Tell me how it happened.
and the real story, not the, "Oh, we met, we fell in love, and we decided to take all that love and make a family, and that's how we made you."
you know something? I'm gonna tell you the real, true story of how me and your mother met.
when I'm old enough. -Yep.
look. I know love isn't a fairytale. -Really?
really.
did you have another girlfriend before you met her?
come on, tell me the truth.
I had two serious girlfriends.
and then some other, a smattering of other women that I dated.
you know.
what?
what's the boy word for slut?
they still haven't come up with one yet, but I'm sure they're working on it.
you a vegetarian this week or not?
Yeah, I am. -Great.
I'm guessing you weren't her first boyfriend.
maybe it was some nerdy guy, or maybe he was mean.
or maybe you were friends for the longest time, and then just when you were about to put your penis into somebody else's vagina...
okay. Good night, Maya.
...you realized Mom was the only one for you!
bedtime!
you still have to tell me the story of why you fell in love with her.
I fell in love with her because she was smart and beautiful and fun.
so now she's stupid and ugly and boring?
of course not. -Then what's the problem?
it's complicated, Maya. -Everything with you is so complicated.
I bet that if you just told me the story, you'd realize that it's not complicated at all.
that you just love her.
I know this is tough for you, but what are you thinking?
that I'm gonna tell you this story and it's gonna make everything better?
it doesn't work that way.
maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. Tell me and we'll find out.
no. Game over. It's time for bed.
no, it's not time for bed! It's time for you to tell me the story!
Maya. -I need to know!
I need to know.
fine! Fine!
I'm gonna tell you the story, -but I'm not telling you who your mom is. -Fine.
you're just gonna have to figure it out for yourself.
good. -And I'm changing all the names and some of the facts, but I just decided that right now.
and then we'll see how smart you are. -I like it. It's like a love story/mystery.
great. Sounds good. You ready? -No.
no.
take your time. -I will.
I know you will. -You go here.
princess pillow? -Thank you.
you bet. -Okay.
I'm ready.
once upon a time, before e-mails and cell phones and reality television shows, in 1992 to be exact, in a little town called Madison, Wisconsin, there lived a young man named William Hayes.
Hey, Will, man, Happy New Year. -Hey, yeah, you, too.
now, this young man was deeply, deeply in love with his college sweetheart.
let's call her...
Emily! -Emily!
Emily!
Hey. -Hi.
Hey, guess who's gonna be the luckiest guy on planet Earth in about four seconds?
you.
happy New Year!
they were a perfect couple.
except to really understand how this young man ended up marrying your mother, you'll also need to know that he had a very big, incredibly embarrassing dream.
all rise for the President of the United States of America,
william
Matthew
Hayes.
you wanted to be President?
I'm just, I don't understand why you have to work for Clinton in New York.
why can't you just work for him in Madison?
well, because they don't need me here. They need me in New York.
they need him, Em. Will's the man. I can't believe you're letting him go.
I mean, don't you know about New York girls?
besides being incredibly hot, they have no problem with casual sex, which by the way, I totally respect.
what if Charlie's right? -Charlie's never right.
he's functionally retarded. -I am worried New York's gonna change you.
change can be good. -If we change together.
so, we'll change together.
okay? It's two months in New York. I'll be back before you know it.
besides, we have a plan, right?
the other thing I can't believe is that you'd risk Ieaving Emily here with me, cause I gotta tell you, I've always had a thing for you...
and I have absolutely no scruples.
wait! I almost forgot. You have to give this to Summer.
she's the only girl I know in New York.
I want you to meet her. -Summer Hartley?
Yes. Yes. -That's her name?
she was on my exchange program at Cambridge, and all the guys wanted to sleep with her, and you probably will, too.
maybe you should mail it to her.
that might be a better idea. -No.
what is it?
something I should have sent her a long time ago.
I love you, William Hayes.
okay. Go, go, go. Go be your brilliant self.
Emily sounds like she would make a good mom.
I just don't know if she's my mom. - Why not?
everyone knows that the girlfriend in the beginning of the story always gets dumped.
which means maybe Summer Hartley is my mother.
I'll never forget that day.
there I was, arriving in the city I always dreamed about to work on a campaign that I believed in with all of my heart.
and on top of that, I was positive that in just a few hours, the campaign manager would realize how brilliant I was.
and then I'd be writing speeches, and then I'd be coming up with strategy, and before long...
GARETH: Will Hayes?
Hey. Gareth Henderson. -You're Gareth.
Hey, how are you? -Nice to meet you. We're walking, Hayes.
I brought my C. V. and a sample of some speeches I wrote for Congressman Sweeney.
fantastic. I cannot wait to peruse these in my abundant spare time.
in the meantime, here's a sample of the coffee and bagel order
I'll need filled immediately.
wait!
you want me to get coffee?
at some point in our lives, we all get coffee. Your time's now. Come on.
we're still walking, Hayes.
have the coffee here by 10: 00, or Arthur's gonna kill me!
that means I'm gonna have to kill you. I've killed before, Hayes.
you should know that. -What is this?
that is a cellular telephone so I can get a hold of you wherever, whenever, for whatever.
can somebody get me an aspirin, please? -Watch it!
glad to have you aboard, Hayes!
Hi. -What? Hi.
Arthur: Four weeks from now, voters of New York State will select their next Democratic nominee for President.
now, if Bill Clinton wins,
I want you to all understand that it's gonna be as a direct result of the commitment and the energy of every person in this room.
and I mean that. That's just a fact.
now, that's how important the work is.
that each and every one of you is...
what am I doing here?
it's the new guy.
Hey. -Hey, is that the toilet paper guy?
can I get a pack of Morley Red, please? -3. 25.
3. 25? These are $2. 15 in Madison, Wisconsin.
so go back to Madison.
don't forget to write. -That's right. Don't forget to write.
hold it! Stop. Stop right there!
you smoked?
no. Yeah.
but I didn't mean to tell you that.
listen. I was young, and I was stupid, and I haven't smoked in years.
I promise you.
is there anything else you should tell me?
probably not.
can I get 10 copies? -Put them on the pile.
no, they're for Arthur. I need them like, 15 minutes ago.
so if you wouldn't mind...
you're the toilet paper guy.
wait. Who's that? That's April.
Yes. I am, in fact, the toilet paper guy, but feel free to call me the bagel-and-coffee guy.
or Todd in Accounting calls me Crystal, which I'm pretty sure is a girl's name.
how many copies? -Ten. Please.
these? -Yeah, both of those.
what made you become a Bill Clinton supporter?
I'm not. This is a money gig. I get paid 12 an hour, which is better than babysitting, which is what I've been doing way too much of.
you're a Democrat, right?
why does everyone have to be a Democrat or a Republican?
I'm struggling with the copy machine.
no, hold on. You're an Independent, aren't you?
I am nothing. Why am I obligated to be something?
why do I have to have an opinion about everything anyway?
I mean, really, what do I know about missile systems or Social Security, or the tax code?
what about civil rights or women's rights?
a woman's right to do what she wants with her body? What about that?
I do what I want with my body.
that's apathetic.
I'm not apathetic. -Yes, you are.
I'm not. I just know that these bozos you're working for, they don't care about anything more than their own ambitions.
that's absolutely not true.
you think this guy, Bill Clinton, is gonna make a huge difference?
I do. -He's gonna do what's already inevitable.
okay, that's where you're wrong. -Don't make me staple your head!
you're wrong. He's gonna make a difference with African Americans.
he's gonna make a difference with women. He gets women.
my God. -I mean, look at his record in Arkansas.
read his plans on health care. Read his plans on education.
okay, or don't. You know, yeah. -Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry. -I just fell asleep.
I'm really sorry. -Yeah. That's fine.
wake up to a new America.
I believe you. -This has been really interesting.
fine. You convinced me. You're nothing. -I'm nothing.
flowers ON TV: So I'm here to repeat in front of all of you...
Hey! Listen up! Look up, everybody!
Yes, I was Bill Clinton's lover for 12 years.
Hey, somebody turn it up.
for the past two years, I have lied to the press about our relationship to protect him.
the truth is, I loved him.
now he tells me to deny it.
well, I'm sick of all of the deceit, and I'm sick of all of the lies.
well, you're right about one thing. He certainly gets women.
this has been fun. Yeah. - Bye, toilet paper guy.
Bye, copy girl.
Oh, my God. It never ends.
they just keep playing it over and over and over again.
it's gonna bIow over. -Right.
peopIe don't really care about this stuff.
that's the thing. -What I don't understand,
I've heard Bush has a mistress.
everybody's talking about it, so why is it okay for him and not for Clinton?
she's trashy.
I mean, her hair alone is enough reason to go after Clinton.
big deal. Everyone has their weaknesses, you know?
those chubby redheads with the long, fake fingernails?
that's what Daddy likes. -That's just nasty.
Gareth, you are unfailingly repugnant.
Hey. That is a coincidence. I love women that say "unfailingly repugnant."
you know what I love?
I love long-haired brunettes with horn-rimmed glasses.
I have no idea why. They're like kryptonite to me.
I got that one, too.
I got a thing for guys who've got a thing for me.
you might wanna look at that. I'm gonna propose a toast.
I am fine with that.
to Bill and his weaknesses. -Yes.
to Bill. -To Bill.
Hello?
Hey! It's me!
is that Emily? -Is that Emily?
Hi, Emily! -Hi, Emily!
what's all that noise?
nothing. That's just a couple of idiots I work with making fun of me because they don't have a beautiful girlfriend that they're eternally devoted to!
you're drunk.
you're beautiful.
you're horny. -You might be right.
Emily? Come to New York.
you'll love it here. It's the energy, the people. It's amazing.
whoa, did you just say "energy"? Will, you did not just say "energy."
what?
you're never coming back.
Hey, come on, now. I just want you to come for a weekend.
you're right. I'm sorry.
did you call Summer?
no. I left her a message. She didn't get back to me.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah. I'm just really lonely here, and I miss you like crazy, and it's really hard.
Yeah. I know what you mean.
Hey. What are you doing up? - Mr. McCormack.
come on, you've been staring at that package for about a week now.
how was the rest of your evening? Successful, I take it.
Oh, my goodness. I'm in big trouble. I love this girl!
you know, that's usually a good thing.
it's hard enough to get elected the first black President without having Julia Roberts on your arm at the inauguration.
that is an impressive mental leap, Russ, going from a one-night stand to being sworn in as President.
open it.
I know you're dying to know what's inside.
just her name alone, Summer Hartley, is driving me...
look it! You got a tear right there! I see it.
come on through. You can do it.
thank you. Yes.
it's a diary. -Sweet Jesus. Let me see.
No! Stop! Stop right there. We're not gonna read this. We can't.
the boys' dorm is across the quad, their windows visible from ours.
the evenings are hot and sticky.
we are all half-dressed, pretending we can't be seen by the boys.
some of us are bold. My new friend "Emily is sweet "and embarrassed by it all, always waiting to see what I will do.
don't stop! This is good stuff. Where were you? Okay.
it's our last night, and the plan has been in place for days.
Emily and I are the last to leave, and as we reach the stairs, I grab Emily firmly by her wrist.
she looks up at me expectantly and I know what will happen next.
do you? -I think I have a pretty good idea.
Oh, my godness!
what are you doing? This is good stuff, man!
wait a minute.
is that your Emily?
good night, Russell!
she is a freak!
put the picture back!
Wow.
HAMPTON: Who is it? -Will Hayes. I called earlier.
HAMPTON: You a Jehovah's Witness?
no.
Christ, you're tall.
Hi.
come in. -Okay.
cIose the door behind you.
HAMPTON: Lock it!
summer said to hang tight. She'll be back. She wants you to wait.
what do you got in there? -I don't know. Are you Summer's father?
Yeah. I'm her daddy.
drink? -No. No. It's a little early for me.
early. You're fresh off the boat, aren't you?
so tell me about yourself. What's your deal? What do you aspire to?
what are your dreams? What are your fancies?
what do you want to be when you grow up?
sit down! -Okay.
what do you do now? You...
wait, don't tell me. You work for your daddy.
no. -No, don't tell me!
wall Street. No!
you kiss ass to some fancy uptown law firm.
actually... -No! I give up. What do you do?
I'm working for Bill Clinton. He's running for President.
no.
I know who Bill Clinton is.
Yeah, in fact, I know more about Bill Clinton than his own mother.
Really? -Yep.
what do you do? -What do I do?
I drink!
drink!
be a man.
there you go! Isn't that better?
swallow!
so tell me about Bill Clinton.
Hey. Wake up.
you want some aspirin?
you must be Will. -Hi.
I see you drank my boyfriend under the table.
he's not your father? - Is that what he told you?
he's my thesis advisor.
what else did he tell you?
he was telling me how to be a real man, as opposed to the sort of boy-man I seem to be. -Did you learn anything?
Yeah, there's a lot of drinking involved.
aIso cursing and fighting.
sex? -Yes.
although that's not what we real men call it.
what do you call it?
I have something for you. This is from Emily.
haven't talked to her in ages. -We'll be moving in together in the fall.
Oh, please! Daddy.
Oh, come on! No.
Oh, this is...
did you read this?
I didn't.
I read a page. -A page.
two pages at the most. -Two?
and the part about you and Emily touching each other and kissing.
Oh! That part, yeah. -Incredibly descriptive. I felt like I was there.
you're a great writer. I mean...
I think you should keep it. You should read it when you're lonely.
I can't. It's your diary, so I can't do that. -No, really, really. I just, I don't need it.
I've already got it memorized, so I'll just leave it on the table.
keep a hard copy. That might be nice for me.
I wonder why Emily gave it to you to give to me.
Hampton?
Hampton? -Are you gonna join us?
that's Hampton Roth. He's an incredible writer.
his book on the McGovern campaign is... -Yeah.
you... -Yeah. We do.
look, have you ever actually had sex with a sexagenarian?
I haven't. -Well, then you shouldn't really judge.
well, actually, I'm not judging. Look at you.
you're beautiful. You're sophisticated. You're a very talented writer.
thank you.
I mean, to please a woman like you, it would obviously take a...
real man. -Exactly.
hard to compete with that. -Well, unless you're the competitive type.
Yep, nice to meet you. -Yeah, it was great meeting you, too.
I feel horrible about taking the...
sorry.
I was just curious.
Hampton encourages me to cultivate my curiosity.
he says it's the key to being a good journalist.
Yeah.
HAMPTON: Summer! Daddy's hungry!
speak of the devil. Better go. Yeah. -Hmm.
HAMPTON: Where the hell are you?
okay, bye. -Bye.
Yeah, give us a call sometime. We should all go out for dinner.
I'd... Yeah, I'd love dinner.
Yeah. -HAMPTON: Hey!
are you gonna call her? -Are you insane?
well, what are you gonna do? -What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball. Emily and I have a future. We have a plan.
which may involve some type of threesome now.
or foursome if that old dude is still in the picture.
you're not helping.
I never should have opened that diary. It's like Pandora's hot, sexy box.
what's a threesome?
what? A threesome.
that's a game that adults play sometimes when they're bored.
whatever. So what happened with Emily?
nothing. I wanted to wait till she came for a visit, and then I decided to do something really dramatic.
it was just one week before the primary, and I had graduated from bagels and toilet paper to signs and bumper stickers.
Jesus! Mercy!
hold, please.
what am I doing here?
move over! Another foot! Go, another foot. Move over!
over, over, over!
just want to let everyone know that the new signs are ready.
they're looking good.
I wrote three speeches for Congressman Sweeney.
how's high school?
he's from Texas. His name's George Bush. But he is not the President.
instead, he's the eldest son of George and Barbara and considered a key political advisor of the White House.
bryant, well, you forgot to mention the Texas Rangers.
bryant: Oh, okay.
man, if this guy's smart, he'll go back to baseball.
no kidding. -Anybody see Hayes?
no. -No.
Hayes! Where is Hayes? Hayes!
is it true you graduated first of your class at Madison?
Yeah. -All right.
come on. We're walking. -We're walking.
here's a list of Madison graduates in the New York area.
these people earn 200 grand plus a year.
we have a $10, 000-a-plate fundraiser on Monday with 15 empty tables.
I can't have that, Hayes. I need you to sell five of them.
hold on. No more coffee, bagels?
we'll see how this goes, okay? -Gareth.
what? -Thank you. I'm really happy right now.
okay, Hayes. -Okay.
there's the desk. -Look at that. Yeah.
Yeah, that's funny, the toilet paper.
that's good because it's ironic.
Yeah, that's right, everybody. My desk.
right here, I got a desk, and I got a list.
and I have a phone. And this empty basket.
no, no, no, I really don't agree that the Governor has a character problem, Mrs. Perleman.
did you know that 50% of Americans believe that marijuana use should be legalized?
Hello?
no, no, no, he wasn't a draft dodger.
besides, did you know that the majority of Americans believe that the Vietnam War was just a terrible idea?
both legs.
wow, I am sorry. You must miss them.
Yes, I understand your concern, but I think you should remember that the Governor comes from a town called Hope.
and hope is exactly what he stands for, so...
no, no, I know it's corny, but I also think that sometimes corny is exactly what this country needs.
that would be wonderful. No, thank you.
two seats.
okay, great. Thank you, Mr. Bishop.
Yeah, the dinner's next Thursday.
Yes, when I spoke with Hillary this morning she said that she wanted to get to know our most important supporters.
no, I think you'd definitely enjoy meeting her.
Yeah.
an entire table? No, that is very possible.
I'll put you down for one table, then. That sounds great.
okay, I look forward to seeing you next Thursday.
okay, thank you.
I just sold an entire table for $50, 000.
that's my guy, Will. My guy.
all: Toilet paper guy! Toilet paper guy!
good evening, gentlemen. Pack of Reds, please.
3. 60. New tax and a new warning.
Christ.
tell us the truth, my friend.
did that Clinton inhale or not? -What does it matter?
that's like if your girlfriend catches you in bed with another woman, then you say, "But we didn't do it."
what, is that gonna matter to her? -Yeah, it does. Hi.
hello. -Pack of American Eagles, blue, please.
4. 25.
4. 25? You pay $4. 25 for a pack of cigarettes?
they don't put as many chemicals in them.
so those are healthy cigarettes. -Something like that.
so if there's not as many chemicals in them, they should cost less, not more, don't you think?
they put saltpeter in your cigarettes, which make them burn faster, which make you smoke more.
which means, at the end of the day, your cigarettes actually cost more, not less.
copy girl, what I think you're actually paying for is the picture of the eagle and the pretty pastel colors.
some reassuring idea about your lifestyle. The rest is pretty much crap.
you wanna bet? -Sure.
20 bucks. -I got 20 bucks.
easiest 20 bucks I ever made.
Really? -Yeah.
that's funny. In a minute, I'll have 40.
okay, we have to inhale at the same time for the same amount of time.
Yep. -Ready, steady, go.
it's my birthday today. -Happy birthday.
why aren't you out celebrating?
my boyfriend, Lucas, was taking me out for dinner and then to a party.
but at last minute, he gets a gig in Philly, which, of course, he takes 'cause...
truth is he's far more interested in being the next Kurt Cobain than being my boyfriend.
who's Kurt Cobain?
you're kidding me!
what?
smoke.
look at that. -Look at that.
all right. -No, come on.
the satisfaction of me being right and you being wrong is more than enough for me.
well, I never welsh on a bet, so I'll tell you what.
I'll take you out for dinner, for a birthday dinner.
what do you say? -Like a date?
no, I didn't mean it like that.
like an "I feel sorry for you because it's your birthday and you have no plans" dinner.
you know, one of those. -Well, I'll tell you what.
you can take me to this party I have to go to, because there's no way I can face going alone.
Yeah, I'm gonna go head over...
I think I'm a little out of my league here.
Yes, you are.
so Emily is what, like, your college sweetheart?
it's amazing how you do that. -What?
the way you take the simplest statement, and then you twist it with a completely negative connotation.
it's really, actually, impressive. I'm amazed. -I didn't mean to do that.
but I understand. I get it. -I actually think it's very sweet.
see, you did it again. -Really?
Yeah. -I don't even know I'm doing it.
it's probably hard for you to imagine a relationship based on mutual respect without even the slightest hint of whatever you call it, masochism.
well, if your deal with Emily is so gosh darn wonderful, then why don't you just marry her?
what's stopping you?
nothing.
Wow. -Wow.
she gets it tomorrow. I made a reservation at some fancy French restaurant on the Upper East Side.
Oh, my God. You're doing it in front of a room full of strangers?
Yeah, I am. What's wrong with that? -No, nothing. I think it shows confidence.
what are you gonna say?
I'm still working on it. I don't know. -Oh, you should work on it with me.
you should practice with me. I'm really good at that. I will be Emily.
I'm Emily, your college sweetheart. Is there something you wanted to ask me?
Emily... -Wait! You've got to get down on your knee.
no, I'm not getting down on my knee.
she'll like it. She'll like seeing you down on your knee.
I'm not getting down on my knee. -Such a mistake. Okay.
Emily. -Yes, William.
don't make me laugh. Emily, will you, marry me?
no. -Oh, my God.
well, what do you mean, "Will you, um, marry me?
I haven't seen you in weeks!
you don't look happy or excited about the prospect of our marriage!
you're asking me to give up my freedom, my joie de vivre for an institution that fails as often as it succeeds?
and why should I marry you, anyway? I mean, why do you wanna marry me?
besides some bourgeois desire to fulfill an ideal that society embeds in us from an early age to promote a consumer capitalist agenda?
Oh, my God!
you should've got on your knee! -Just shut up!
here.
I wanna marry you because you're the first person that I want to look at when I wake up in the morning and the only one I wanna kiss goodnight.
because the first time that I saw these hands,
I couldn't imagine not being abIe to hold them.
but mainly, when you love someone as much as I love you getting married is the only thing left to do.
so will you...
marry me?
definitely. Maybe.
I have to think about it.
walk me home?
do you want a cup of tea? -Yeah. I'd love one.
Hey.
how come you have so many copies of Jane Eyre?
it's a long story. -Really?
it seems to be about 300 pages or so.
seriously, why?
for my 13th birthday, I wanted a pair of gold stud earrings, and instead my dad bought me a hardcover copy of Jane Eyre.
and inside, he wrote a beautiful inscription, which I could care less about at the time seeing as I was so pissed about the earrings, which was tragic as it turned out 'cause it was the last present he ever gave me.
what do you mean?
he died three weeks later in a car accident.
Jesus. That's awful.
I'm sorry.
have you ever read it? -No.
I read it every year or two. Each time it's different.
it tells me different things.
anyhow, when I went away to college, my mom sold our house and somewhere along the way, Jane Eyre got lost.
now, every time I pass a second-hand bookstore,
I look for the copy that my dad bought me for my birthday.
I know I'll never find it.
it's stupid, but it's become this, like, weird superstitious little...
it's not stupid. -Thanks. Hobby.
what are all these?
Oh, these are the ones I found that have inscriptions.
with love and hopes and dreams of second chances. Alice.
what is this?
this is Kurt Cobain. This is Nirvana. Do you like it?
Yeah, I do.
you think it's ridiculous that I want to be a politician, don't you?
Yes. -Thank you.
no, no, I get the whole politician thing. It's easy to like you.
that's true. That's very true.
I just wonder if you want people to like you a little too much.
that's also true.
I should want them to hate me.
I'm gonna start working on that right away. You got any tips for me?
no, but you're off to a great start.
yeah? -I'm hating you already.
good.
what do you wanna be when you grow up?
I mean, you're too smart to be making Xeroxes -and babysitting. -No.
I don't know! -Whatever else you do.
I don't know, and I don't know how to know. You know?
you know what I really wanna do is I wanna go to all those places that I know nothing about.
I've been saving money.
but I can't even get it together to do that.
probably because I'm stuck in a rut with this guy.
you should dump him.
I know that's none of my business, but you're too good for him.
you are.
you know what's really cool? -I don't.
we can just sit here and we don't have to worry about -flirting or all the attraction stuff. All that stuff.
very cool.
Yeah.
I got to go.
dumbass!
Oh, God. - There he is!
told you he wouldn't be long. -Hi! I wanted to surprise you!
I took the red-eye! - That's incredible!
I was just telling Emily how Arthur sent you to Albany as part of the advance team.
advance team. - Yeah. How'd it go?
how'd it go? Man, it went great! -Great.
great. -Great.
are you okay? -Oh, yeah, I was just getting a little exercise.
I ran up the stairs. -Okay.
I'm going to the office. It's... Got a big day. Nice meeting you.
and you. -Okay.
okay.
good luck.
Hi. -Hi.
here. -Yeah.
Hey.
it's weird. Your tongue tastes different. -What?
it tastes different, your tongue.
that is weird. -It's not bad. It's just different.
maybe it's the tap water here.
or the pH balance... I don't know what I'm talking about.
told you New York was gonna change you.
could we maybe go for a walk? -Yeah.
just to get some air? -Yeah, you could see New York.
I would love that.
so, did I ever tell you... I was gonna...
Oh, sorry. No, go. -What?
I was gonna say, did I ever tell you about the day my dad proposed to my mom?
no.
well, Dad was on his way to meet my mom to propose, and he runs into his ex-girlfriend, Caroline Hopper.
and they're talking, they're looking at each other, and all these old feelings, they start coming up.
and he's thinking, "I could run away right now with Caroline Hopper, "be a happy man.
all I have to do is kiss her.
but instead, he looks up, and he sees my mom walking around the corner.
and that moment he knows that he had no reason to be afraid.
you understand?
am I Caroline Hopper in this story or your mom?
Oh, my God! I'm your mom!
Emily, when I saw you this morning... -Will, please.
... I knew... -Put that back in your pocket.
just stand up, Will. Stop. -...with absolute clarity.
wait, wait, wait. -I have no reason to be afraid.
let's think about this. -I'm not afraid of this.
it's just like the day that my...
will!
I slept with Charlie!
I thought we had a plan.
well, you had a plan, Will. You have a really big plan!
pretty sure we both had that plan. -I just can't keep pretending -that I want to be part of it anymore. -You were there -when we made it. -And I didn't know how to tell you.
how do you tell someone that you care about that you don't want the same things -they want anymore? -The best way?
definitely having sex with the roommate.
it was cowardly, and I'm sorry.
Oh, good.
you're killing me.
no, I'm not. I'm letting you go.
cause if we stay together, Will, we're gonna be miserable.
I'm gonna hold you back from all these...
that's not true. -...incredible dreams that you have.
and then, eventually, you're totally gonna hate me for it.
no. -Yes.
will, I don't want that, and you don't want that.
trust me.
you're gonna be just fine, Mr. Hayes, without me.
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.
announcer: Here is Tom Brokaw in New York.
good evening. Bill Clinton may have been wounded in New York, but the big question tonight is, to what degree?
because, after all, he is the big survivor, indeed, the victor in the New York primary and by a comfortable margin.
women: Goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
sometimes it's all a big surprise 'Cause there was a time when all I did
Hey.
Congratulations.
I hear they asked you to stay on. You must be very happy.
Yeah, yeah, he did, and I am. Very, very happy.
Really? Why do I feel like I should hide the razor blades?
and the staplers and those scissors?
I'll be fine. But this song, it's an excellent cure for the will to live.
I know. What about the dancing? Make that end.
I'm sorry about the other night.
it's okay. I just didn't think that Lucas would approve.
or Emily, for that matter. - Well.
besides, you and me, it'd kind of be like cats and dogs.
Yeah. Yeah.
oil and water. -Sandpaper and bare ass.
that's gross. That's just gross. -You'd be the ass.
Yeah. No, thank you.
I'd be honored. -Lennon and McCartney.
they were good together. -Yeah, while it lasted, and then they couldn't even be friends.
I think we can, at least, manage that. -I think we could.
enchant. -Yeah. Salud.
come on, let's dance. -No.
Why? -Okay.
you ready? Yeah.
guess that's it for Emily.
I can't believe that she rehearsed with Charlie.
I can't believe it, either. -That leaves April. Maybe Summer.
anybody else? -I was too busy.
I was too busy working on the campaign.
anyway, when Clinton got elected,
Russell and I started our own consulting firm, and we worked on campaigns for everybody.
city council, state senate.
we even did one for the local dog catcher.
that's very interesting, Dad, but what about girlfriends?
what about Mom? -Well, I started dating again.
but nothing serious. -What about April? What happened to her?
well, a week after Kurt Cobain died, she broke up with her boyfriend.
she went traveling.
she traveled all over the world, just like she always dreamed of doing.
and she says that it was because of something that I said to her on her birthday.
anyway, we started writing postcards. We started writing letters.
and before I knew it, even though we were separated by entire worlds, we became great friends.
it was 1994, and New York was full of new life.
more jobs, more money.
that was the start of the Internet. And overnight, everyone in Manhattan had a cell phone.
can you hear me now?
which they never put down.
and then, our old boss, Arthur Robredo gave Russell and me our first big break.
this just came for you. -Thanks.
I had finally made it inside the room.
Gareth. -Hayes.
good morning.
Hey, let's get this party started.
what's the word from upstate?
for the first time, New York was coming to me, instead of the other way around.
the most endangered species in our nation "isn't a big woodpecker or some freshwater fish.
it's the tongue in our heads!
listen to the truncated bastard language of today.
the average vocabulary is a third of what it was 100 years ago.
words fall out of our mouths and die at our feet!
the landscape of vocabulary is being hacked down "and grubbed up by the dribble of pop culture, "poisoned by lazy obscenity...
will?
HAMPTON: ..."infantilized by a youth-obsessed media..."
Hey. -Hey.
it's my favorite man-boy. You look very manly.
well, thank you, thank you. That's the aim.
how's Emily? -Emily.
she's starring in somebody else's diary now.
how's the Professor? -The Professor is wonderful.
he's funny. -He dumped me for a sophomore.
told me it was for my own good.
everybody seems to be using that line these days.
what have you been up to?
I'm writing these really dumb items for New York Magazine.
waiting for my big break.
and 'syntax' isn't what Nevada brothels pay the IRS.
I'm gonna go listen to the Professor. -Sure.
nice glasses.
HAMPTON: "Listen to your kids if you can."
thank you. Scotch, rocks, please.
william Hayes!
from... Don't tell me!
Wisconsin! Yes, the Cheese State.
very nice of you to come to our little shindig.
I'll have another, please. -PIeasure.
Yeah. Summer tells me you're writing speeches now for Arthur Robredo?
she tells me you're dating a sophomore. -No. Actually, it's two freshmen, which, on a good day, add up to a sophomore, I suppose.
waIk with me. Why would you wanna work for a hack like Arthur Robredo?
as I recall from our first encounter, you're a man of principles and ideals, even.
don't tell me you're just another yuppie puppy in an Armani suit.
you were wonderful, darling. Is he being nice? You being nice?
nice? Yeah, he can handle himself. -Sure, I can handle myself.
first of all, Arthur Robredo is not a hack. He's worked his way up from the streets.
he was a cop, an entrepreneur.
he's a putz. This is exactly what my book is about.
here. Read it. It's free.
beauty, ideals, love don't mean squat anymore.
it's all about power and money. -I've read every single one of your books, and you're completely obsessed with power and money.
that's because he doesn't have any. Right, babe?
babe, I am about the love.
as you know. -Yes.
that's why you keep me around.
to keep that rampant, rapacious ambition of yours in check.
I have a thought.
why don't you use that newly acquired scintilla of power and influence to get Summer here to write an article about your man Robredo?
that way Summer gets a break, and you get the word out.
what do you get, Hampton? -Yeah.
I guess it's the love. More of the love. Yeah, that's what I'm about.
more love.
I knew Summer would be back. -Did you?
you know what? At first, I didn't want Summer to be my mom.
but now I'm kinda liking her. Did you ask her out on a date?
I wanted to, but I couldn't 'cause she was writing the article.
Wow. This is pretty good. -Will, this is really good.
summer: Are you sure it didn't seem like a puff piece?
no, it's perfect. It's absolutely...
you know, there's one part, though, that kind of bothered me.
william Hayes, Robredo's chief speech writer, is both intense and boyishly handsome.
Boyishly? I mean... -Yeah.
you know, I originally wrote, "William Hayes has seductive eyes and the intriguing looks of someone "whose clothes you wanna rip from his very body,
but the editor made me change it.
there's just no room for truth in journalism.
did you always want to be a journalist?
no. Until I was 16, I wanted to be an actress. I wanted to sing on Broadway.
Wow. Really?
Yeah, really. Is that hard to believe?
well, aren't actresses needy and emotional and, you know, insecure?
that sort of thing.
what are you saying? That I don't need? That I don't have emotions?
I'm an incredibly needy person. -I'm not saying that.
I'm a very needy person. -You know what I'm saying?
I'm saying I would love to hear a song.
I'm sorry? -Give us a song.
you want me to sing you a song? -Why not?
you have a favorite? -Yes.
you do? -Yeah.
okay.
how glad the many millions
of Timothys and Williams would be -I'm a William. -Don't interrupt.
to capture me
but you had such persistence
you wore down my resistance
I fell
and it was swell
it's not that you're attractive
Wow.
will you please put it on?
you know, it really isn't so bad.
you know what the funny part is? It's $1, 000.
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
Frank Sinatra, Linda Ronstadt.
Why? A whole bunch of these.
well, if you look on the back, they all have one common song, which is...
I've Got A Crush On You. -Every one of them.
how's it going? -Still got a lot to do.
Yeah, me, too.
Yeah, I'm about done. -Yeah, me, too.
the world will pardon my mush 'Cause I've got a crush, my baby, on...
was I snoring?
you know what I've never done?
what?
I've never spent the whole day in bed with a really great guy.
me, neither.
I'm serious.
I always think of something more important to do.
I'm a workaholic.
it's really bad.
will you spend the whole day in bed with me?
we do nothing.
Hi, this is Summer. Please leave a message, and I will call you back.
this is Dr. Levenstein from the Columbia Presbyterian emergency room. We have...
emergency room? Hello?
Mr. Roth has had an aortal rupture. -What does that mean exactly?
think of it like a tire blowing out on the highway after going too fast for way too long.
how's that, Mr. Roth? Are you comfortable?
I make a living.
come on, sweetheart, give me a smile. I've waited my whole life to do that joke.
poor Hampton.
summer's come.
what's he doing here? -Hello, Hampton.
hello.
one thing they've left intact.
no, no, no, no, no, no, don't mention grassroots.
don't mention osmosis.
it's killing me that you're going out with the kid.
Really? It's not the booze or the cigarettes or the sophomores?
that has nothing to do with this. -Nothing to do with it.
listen, I want you to know I've donated my organs to medical science except for one, which is for you.
sweetie, that's so kind. -No, no, not that.
my heart, stupid.
please tell me you're not in love with him.
I can't do that.
can I have a cigarette? Just a dying man's last request.
not happening. God, you're such a drama queen.
nobody's dying.
what do you care if I'm in love with him, huh?
you're the one who set us up, remember?
Yeah, well, I kind of figured you'd chew him up and spit him out.
you're such a sweetie. You're a sweet guy, you know that?
I read the Robredo piece. -Yeah.
the guy's been in New York politics for over 20 years and all you can dig up is that his daughter had an eating disorder?
what are you saying, Hampton?
do your job.
I can't believe we're finally gonna meet the President.
look at that. -Look at it.
we've come a long way from that hotel room on 8th Avenue.
thank you very much.
GARETH: I don't believe it! I don't believe it!
which idiot forgot to check the menus and the programmes?
there's no union seal on the menus or the programmes.
are you serious?
the hotel workers won't let anybody into the building.
the Teamsters won't set up the satellite feed!
has anyone seen Robert Klein?
I was with him like an hour ago. Now he's gone.
I think he was completely plastered.
how are we supposed to know where Robert Klein is?
you're not gonna believe this, but there's a hailstorm in Chicago.
who cares about Chicago?
we do. The President's coming in from Chicago.
okay, okay. -We can't worry about that right now.
let me ask you a question. How could you let this happen?
what? What are you talking about? -Why are you jumping down her throat?
whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys, guys, guys, guys, hey!
Hey, deep breath, okay? Look, let's just ask the hotel, see if we can use the Internet connection and find a printer.
I'll call Klein's agent. -Great.
Gareth, have a drink.
you, I don't know who you are, but your fly's down.
be great if you wore underwear. I'm gonna go check the weather in Chicago.
table seven's up. Six pasta. Two fish. Get it out the door, now!
he may not be in your union, but he still happens to be the President of the United States.
remember him? So if I was you, -I'd get your men off that truck and in this... -Gareth!
you can't talk to a Teamster like that! Come on.
this guy... -Everything's gonna be fine.
look, look, check it out.
I downloaded a copy of the union seal.
if you could just please paste it onto a menu, make 500 copies, use a union shop. We're gonna be home free, here.
copies? You want me to make copies?
well, at some point, we all make copies. Your time is now.
that's not funny, Hayes. That's very...
Yeah, that's real mature. Where are you going?
I'm walking! Back in half an hour.
what a dick.
Yeah. -William Hayes?
speaking.
I'm watching you right now.
and I know all about you and your friend Robredo.
in fact, I know so much, I could bring you both down.
Really?
who am I speaking with? -Why don't we meet, and you'll find out?
where are you? -I'm close by.
I don't have a lot of experience with whatever this is.
you're getting warm.
you're hot.
you are so hot!
I got you!
I thought you were gone through the summer.
no, I thought so, too, but this crazy thing happened.
I mean, I was camping on this beautiful beach in Crete with all these really cool people, and there was this guy that I liked, Paco, brooding and sexy, monosyllabic and totally my type.
one night I'm dancing with Paco and he kisses me, -an incredible, deep kiss. - Spare me the details.
and what do I do? -I don't know. What'd you do?
I start crying.
I mean, tears are rolling down my cheeks... -Of course you start crying.
...which he doesn't notice 'cause, of course, his hands are all over my body, which felt nice, which made me feel even more upset, 'cause in a flash
I saw our entire relationship, from present to future tense.
I mean, the incredibly hot start, with Paco basking in my love and admiration...
what are we doing here? -I just got to pick something up.
just take a second.
and then the inevitable moment, and I don't know why it...
hello. -Hi.
I don't know why it happens, but it always does, when all that love and admiration would start to irritate him and he'd find some way to hurt me.
I mean, sure, after, he'd be sorry.
so...
I decided to unlock his beautiful lips from mine, remove his hand from my ass, -and I walked away. -Good move.
I walked away, Will! From Paco! -Good move.
no one walks away from Paco! -I like the story.
and it felt life-changing.
and I realized I had to tell someone.
when I realized who that person was, -it was so unexpected. - Here we are, sir.
it's like when something is staring you in the face and it's like you're too blind to see it.
what's that?
I have some news for you, too.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you so upset?
don't you think it's a little weird we've been writing each other for however long and somehow you neglect to tell me that,
a, you've fallen in love, and, B, you've fallen in love!
I told you I was dating someone. -Dating someone.
you just bought a diamond engagement ring for someone!
I'm sorry. I think I was just nervous to tell you.
why would you be nervous to tell me?
I don't know.
I love this girl so much.
I'd just really like you to be happy for me.
I can be happy for you. Of course I can be happy for you.
poor April.
she's like the character in the story who's always been the friend.
then she realized she doesn't just want to be the friend.
she wants to be the girlfriend, except it's too late.
what do you mean?
weren't you listening? She came home for you.
GARETH: There's union seals on all the menus, my friend.
the weather cleared in Chicago. The President will be here by 8: 00.
Where's Russ?
gonna meet you and Arthur in the restaurant.
robert KLEIN: I'm funnier over here.
I can't stop my leg.
you're early.
good to see you.
you look great. -Thank you. You, too.
that's a nice tie. -Well, you'd know.
so, the magazine asked me to do a follow-up on Robredo.
great. -Yeah, it is great. It's also...
it's...
you just read it.
you already wrote it. -Yeah.
he did this? -Yes.
they actually got a friend an early parole.
you know what? I think it happened such a long time ago, and you're way ahead in all the polls.
Yeah, see, I don't think that's gonna matter, because he's the tough-on-crime Democrat.
that's...
when people read this...
summer, listen to me.
if you hand this in, we won't survive it.
I think it'll be a big deal for about a week, and then the storm will pass...
I'm talking about you and me.
candidate Brought Down by Speechwriter's GirIfriend.
come on. -I'm just doing my job.
I didn't do it the first time around.
and if I didn't write this, somebody else would.
let them.
Hey, don't hand this in, okay?
you already did.
Mr. Arthur...
Arthur: Yeah, sure.
I really liked Summer.
I can't believe she turned out to be such a...
heartbreaker? -No.
opportunist? Double-crossing... -Uh-uh.
bitch. -Maya.
how could she do that to you?
it's like she said. If she didn't write it, someone else would have.
and it was the truth.
so did she? Did she break it?
what?
what happened when the article came out?
you screwed up, man. You really screwed up.
please save it. I don't need to hear this right now.
whenever I figure out whatever I'm supposed to learn from all this, -I'll write you a letter! -Yeah, can't wait.
so I lost my girl, I lost my job, and I lost my friend.
and for a long time, nothing seemed to matter.
but I wasn't the only one with problems.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman,
miss Lewinsky.
I never told anybody to lie.
Hello? -Are you watching?
these allegations are false.
April?
Yeah, April. Who'd you think it was? Are you watching or not?
of course I'm watching.
you think he did it, don't you?
I don't think, I know. Look at the picture of her. I love her.
she's so his type.
so, what took you so long to finally call me back there, red?
I thought I lost you.
feels like years. -I'm calling you now, aren't I?
Yeah.
how are you? What's doing?
I got a new roommate, Olivia.
and I'm working at a bookstore.
but I've been thinking about going back to school.
cool.
Hey, did I tell you that I hate my job?
I used to love what I do, and now I feel like a complete hack.
are you seeing anyone? -Me? Am I... No, no. Absolutely not.
in fact, I haven't had sex since Clinton was re-elected.
why bother? He's having enough sex for the entire country.
easy. Easy now.
Hey, maybe you should follow his lead and seduce an intern.
you know, it's funny that you should mention that.
there's a fetching young intern who just started a week ago.
great. Ask her out.
I should, shouldn't I?
but I don't think I will. You see, I don't want a fling.
I want the real deal.
forget about the real deal. You don't find it, it finds you.
what does that mean? I don't know what that means.
it means that you get to a certain age and then you're ready.
you know, you're ready for kids or a commitment or, you know...
sir. -...a mortgage.
table's ready. Okay. -Thanks.
you know what I mean?
and the person that you're with then, they become the one.
so you're saying it's not who, but it's when.
exactly. -Okay. All right.
so there's never been a guy, ever, that made you think, "This is it.
this is him. This is the one.
no.
okay, then why aren't you out there, you know, enjoying yourself?
I am.
you are? -Yes.
right now I'm seeing this guy, Kevin.
Kevin. -Kevin.
who the hell's Kevin?
where did... How come you never, you know, mentioned anything about him?
I'm mentioning him now.
Oh, God! They have fresh mint tea. I love fresh mint tea.
I love beer.
it depends upon what the meaning of the word "is" is.
if it means "there is none" that is a completely true statement.
Hey, this is April.
I want to talk to you about your birthday. Call me.
hello. I hope this is the right number. It sounds like you.
it's Emily!
I'm in New York, and I was thinking maybe we could get a cup of coffee and catch up.
my number...
Hey, it's April. I still need to talk to you. Please call me back.
I mean, don't make me come over there and hurt you.
okay, I'm coming!
God, I'm coming.
Yeah, I get it.
what are you doing in there?
is this what you're wearing? -What?
it's your birthday party. Everybody is waiting for you.
Oh, Christ.
five minutes, okay? Five...
I'm down. -Are you okay?
Yeah. I just need to lie here for a sec.
I see you've been eating noodles.
Hey, everybody, he's here!
Thanks.
Hi.
Oh, my God! I didn't think you'd be here!
I couldn't miss your birthday. We came all the way up from Washington.
happy birthday, gorgeous.
that is a beautiful woman right there.
you had your chance, pal.
Hayes.
come on.
it's great to see you. -Yeah. You look...
homeless, I know.
Where's Kelly? -She's right over there.
it's her first night out since the baby was born.
Congratulations.
iran-contra. Arms for oil, no problem.
but a little "oralness" and you're headed for impeachment.
no politics! -Maybe he should be impeached.
whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait! Did he say that?
why not? I put my faith in him. We all did. -You love him.
I thought he was gonna be different than the other jokers, but this guy, he can't even define the word "is."
what happens if they give him one of the hard words, like "truth"?
I'd vote for him again. -In a heartbeat.
will's a lot of fun.
Yeah, let's fill up the tub and drop in a toaster.
that should be a good time.
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday, dear Will. -Where is he? Where's Will? -I don't know. I was just talking to him.
you missed your birthday cake.
and I baked it. -You baked it.
do you remember that song?
in your apartment?
come as you are, as a friend
as a known enemy -"Memory," not "enemy." -I know, I know, I know.
somebody had too much to drink. -No, I didn't.
I didn't, I didn't. I didn't.
Yes, you did. -I did.
God, you're beautiful. -Thank you.
what?
the thing is...
the thing is...
is that I like you.
I've always liked you.
like.
that's pathetic. It's so puny.
"love" on the other hand...
you'd run away from a word like that.
I love you.
I'm in love with you, April.
why didn't you ever tell me? -Come on.
you know exactly why I never told you. You'd never be interested in me.
you're an idiot.
stop. -What?
not like this. -Like what?
look at you, Will, you're a mess.
why couldn't you have told me when you had your shit together?
my shit is together. -Your shit is a mess.
you're a mess.
my shit is a mess?
that's interesting, coming from you, April.
you could do anything on earth, and you work in a bookstore.
what's that all about?
at least I tried. I went out there and I tried.
look, I'm just saying this as a friend, and I swear, it's just as a friend, but maybe you should go out there and, you know, get some help.
go to rehab or life rehab or something like that.
I don't even know if they have that sort of thing, but if they did...
okay.
...you know, you could be a prime candidate for that.
I should go to "life rehab"? -Yeah.
get off my front porch!
April?
you're right.
it is complicated, isn't it?
I mean, you're in love with April, who used to be in love with Lucas, and then she fell in love with you, but you were in love with Summer, who was always really in love with Hampton.
and now that you're in love with April, she's in love with Kevin.
and no one's in love with you.
that's complicated.
Yep.
then what happened?
Jane Eyre, Random House, 1943.
it's a beautiful edition, known for the cover illustration.
but there's a really nice dedication inside, with a quote from the book.
to my darling daughter, April. 'The human heart has hidden treasures' -'In secret kept, in silence sealed...' -'In silence sealed 'The thoughts, the hopes the dreams, the pleasures 'Whose charms were broken if revealed'
from your loving father.
Hi, Olivia. -Hi, Will.
how you been? -Good.
I haven't heard any of your long sorry messages in a while.
those were delightful, weren't they? Sorry about that.
april here? -No, she's at school.
school? -Yeah.
she started grad school at NYU. -Great. Wow.
if you want to wait, she'll be home soon. -I'd love to.
make yourself comfortable. I have to finish this application I'm writing.
good luck. -Thanks.
Hey.
how you doing?
Kevin.
will Hayes.
I'm just waiting for April.
are you the same Kevin that she mentioned a while back?
I hope so. Unless she's collecting Kevins.
Olivia: Kevin, phone!
anyway, I'm pretty sure I am the only Kevin who's actually living with her.
do you know what you want yet?
no. -WAITRESS: No?
will?
william Hayes?
God.
it is! -Summer.
you look beautiful.
believe it or not, I've been meaning to call you.
I'm pregnant. -You're what?
Really? -Can you believe it?
please, sit. Congratulations. -Thanks. Thanks.
who's the lucky guy?
Sam Knowles. -Okay.
but he's basically out of the picture.
he didn't make the cut, huh? -Yeah.
well, I don't need a guy. I never really did.
you were about the closest I ever got.
no, really, when I was with you, I thought, "This is it."
but I screwed it up.
no, you didn't. -I did. I so did.
listen,
I'm having a little party Sunday.
I want you to come. -Oh, boy.

will you come? Please?
you know, I'll see if I can make it.
I really want you to. -I'll make it.
I want to make amends with anyone I ever hurt.
and I figure it'll take about nine months, which is perfect timing.
and she's off. Bye. -Bye-bye.
william Hayes.
dad, maybe this wasn't such a good idea. - What?
telling me this story, this mystery love story.
what if I don't like who my mom is? -Of course you'll like who your mom is.
and you don't have to wait long to find out, because that very night...
it's Summer, isn't it? And you're not my father.
no wonder you didn't want to be with her.
take it easy, Maya. It's just a story.
and this one has a happy ending.
how does it have a happy ending?
you and my mom, whoever she is, you're getting divorced.
what's the happy in that?
okay, you know what? I think we should stop now.
No!
then how about a nice cup of tea?
if you want, I'll still continue with the story. Does that sound good?
Maya? -Okay.
dad?
I can't believe you smoked and drank and were such a slut.
but I still love you.
Thanks.
all right. All right.
no, no. Don't eat it yet! Not till we get to our bench.
you're in a good mood.
well, I think I discovered who my mom is in the story.
Really? -Really.
well, who is it? -Not telling.
so the last time we saw William Hayes, he had just discovered that the woman he truly loved, April Hoffman, was in love with another man.
I know. Shocking.
meanwhile, he accepted an invitation to the home of his ex-girlfriend, Summer Hartley, who, if she does turn out to be my mother, I'm running away to Canada.
I'm not kidding.
he died last year. -Yeah.
you heard? -I read about it in The Times.
Yeah. -Yeah.
God. Died in his office. Heart attack? -Yeah.
I always imagined that he'd make a more theatrical exit.
what they didn't say was he was on the couch with the dean's daughter.
Jesus. -I'm kidding.
actually, he was completely alone and it was hours before the janitor found him.
you want a drink? -I'm sorry.
you must miss him. -I do, yeah.
these are for you.
Oh, Will. -Yeah.
they're beautiful.
so are you.
summer. -Will.
don't mess with me.
I can see where you're going with this.
in a second, you're gonna say something impossibly charming.
Really? -Yeah. It's gonna be great.
and then you're gonna sweep me off my feet and we all know where that's going.
can't a girl miss a guy? -And you know that's gonna end badly.
Yeah, she can, but I just don't really have time for the pain.
so let's just skip all that, why don't we? -Okay.
fair enough.
can we be friends?
Yeah! Yeah. -Yeah.
shake on it? Okay. -Let's do that. All right.
you know what?
there's someone here I want you to meet.
Yeah. Come with me.
they're an old flame of mine, and I think you guys are really gonna, you know, hit it off.
Emily.
I'm gonna put these in some water.
you look... -You look...
you look great.
why are you in New York? -I live here.
I took a job with the city education department.
I called you. -I know.
I've been meaning to call you back. -Liar.
I had lost your number. -Of course.
no, it's true. You know what? -Will...
okay, give me your number, right now.
I'm gonna put it in my cell phone, and that way I'm never gonna lose it, okay?
my number is 212-664-7665.
six, six, five. See? Now I got it. And I'm never gonna lose it again.
Oh, no, go ahead, go ahead. -Sorry.
hello. -Hey, it's Will.
I'm really sorry I lost your number.
I just had the weirdest flash of a whole life, one that never, ever happened.
what did happen to us?
you slept with my roommate. -Oh!
I'm sorry.
if I remember correctly, I believe it was my "plan," wasn't it?
the plan. Remember that? -Yes, the plan.
who talks like that?
no, it wasn't the plan. I was scared of you and your dreams, and then after we broke up, I just felt lost.
I still feel pretty lost, especially when it comes to relationships.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've been... Me, too.
did you ever think that maybe we just needed a different plan?
wait! Stop! Stop right there. Now, go back.
okay, stop. Now go forward, slowly.
now here it comes.
there! Right there!
that's it! That's how I figured it out!
that's what Mom does when I'm upset.
she fluffs up my hair and tells me to be brilliant or shine like the sun, and it always makes me feel better.
sounds like a great mom. -She is a great mom.
so you're absolutely positive, 100%, that Emily is the very same woman walking toward us right now?
Absolutely.
is it?
mom! Mom! -Hey!
I'm so glad it's you.
well, who else would it be? -Nobody.
good morning, Will. -Hey, Sarah.
mom, can Dad come with us to the zoo?
Yeah, if Dad wants to come, sure.
you know, I love the zoo. Let's go to the zoo.
guess what, Mom? - What?
we learned all about sexual intercourse at school yesterday.
Really? -Really.
really.
I love penguins.
me, too.
me, three.
did you know that penguins mate for life?
although, Mr. Monell told us that sometimes the husband and wife penguins get separated 'cause of their migraine patterns.
migratory. -Migratory.
well, sometimes they're apart for years, but they almost always find each other.
do you know what the husband and wife penguins do after they find each other after all that time?
throw back their heads, flap their flippers and sing as loud as they can!
okay. All right, munchkin. Let's go!
Hey, monster, that was fun today. I'll see you on Wednesday, okay?
see you later.
dad!
thanks for telling me the story. -You're welcome.
I forgot to tell you the happy ending. -What is it?
you.
Hey, I love you. -I love you, too.
go catch up to your mom, okay? All right, bye.
are you all right?
yeah?
Mr. President! Hey, Mr. President!
will Hayes, I worked on the '92 campaign.
Hi. I'm looking for April.
check that they have legal representation, okay?
right. -Thanks, John.
I can't believe you're doing this.
this is great. -Thanks.
still smoking? -I quit.
me, too. Still live in the same loft? -Living in Brooklyn.
aIways on the cutting edge.
dating? -Not at present. You?
I got divorced. -I know.
I heard. I'm so sorry.
Why?
you always said marriage was overrated.
Yeah, and you never listened to me. You were always with the rings.
is that why you and Kevin never... -Oh, God, Kevin. No. Kevin...
something always seemed to be missing with Kevin.
I don't know.
it's weird. It was never quite right. You know?
Yeah.
it's good to see you. -You, too.
I have something for you.
thank you so much.
how did you find it? I mean, where did you find it?
that's the difficult part to explain.
this is gonna sound bad.
I've had it for a while.
how long?
years.
many years.
I meant to...
I meant to give it to you. I wanted to give it to you.
I just...
I couldn't. And I don't know why.
I dropped it off once. I mean, I tried. Kevin was there and...
Hey, there is no excuse, and I'm sorry.
it's inexcusable.
I think you should go, Will. -April?
I think you should go.
you never gave it to her? After all that time?
I know. I know. -But it was from her dad.
I know. I know.
and then you just left?
Yep.
how come you changed all the names except hers?
what do you mean?
in the story, you know, like Mom became Emily, and Summer's that Natasha lady who writes for that magazine.
but you didn't change April's name. Why?
why are you so concerned with all of this anyway?
because I want you to be happy.
you know,
I'm happy.
trust me, Dad. You're not happy.
put your coat on.
Taxi! -Taxi!
she said something was missing with Kevin, which means it might not be missing with you, -which is good news, right? -CouId be.
couId be.
did you know that 35 people try to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge each year?
most because of broken hearts.
I'll keep that in mind.
hello. -Hey. Hi.
it's me, Will.
April?
what are you doing here?
go on, tell her.
who's that?
that would be my daughter, Maya.
that's kind of cheating, isn't it? Bringing your daughter?
what am I supposed to do now?
well, you could let us in.
I think you're wrong.
come on, let's go. Let's go.
a little while longer. She's going to let us in.
okay, kiddo, here's the deal.
I'm gonna count to 30, okay?
and if she doesn't let us in, we're gonna go home, and we're never gonna talk about this again.
deaI? -Yeah.
ready?
if she lets us in, tell her the story like you told me.
and then she'll know. - Know what?
I can't explain. She'll just know.
twenty-nine and a quarter.
twenty-nine and a half.
twenty-nine and three-quarters.
what comes after that?
time to go.
but this wasn't what was supposed to have happened.
I know. -I really thought she would have heard through the intercom and let us in, or run down the stairs and say...
what story?
I kept the book... -Yeah?
...because it was the only thing that I had left of you.
you must be Maya. -You must be April.
so what happens now?
what have you got for us, Boris?
it's a teenage boy. Found in Greenwich Park last night.
it's a messy one.
it's the messy ones we're interested in, my friend.
give us a moment to pay our respects, Boris.
do your thing, Mina.
what is it?
it was Luke.
it looked like he was dead.
demons S01 EP05
I save Mina from being blown up.
I save you and Galvin from drowning in a sewer.
no chocolates, no flowers, nothing.
I don't think Galvin's big on thank yous.
what's she staring at?
nice. Very subtle.
who is she? I've never seen her before.
would you put your tongue away?
maybe she's staring cos she likes what she sees.
Oh, please!
yeah?
watch this.
I wouldn't if I were you.
I swear that's been there since last week.
lasagne on a Monday. Are you crazy?
they take all the meat from last week, mince it up.
that's what's in your lasagne.
in your expert opinion, is there anything safe to eat?
in this place? Forget it.
so, why are you in the queue?
I'm thirsty.
I think I'm dehydrated.
baked potato. Hmm, good choice.
haven't seen you around before. New, yeah?
can I sit with you?
this whole thing about the food, the charming, witty banter, do you practise it?
no.
trust me.
you really need to.
seriously...
professor Lambert.
Hi.
rupert Galvin.
mina Harker.
we spoke on the phone with regard to this pictogram and what it might mean.
it looks like Sumerian.
Sumerian? Really? I'm not familiar with Sumerian?
not many people are.
it's a Middle Eastern language. It dates from about 2500BC.
do you think you could find your way around translating it for me?
well, I can certainly give it a try.
thank you.
attractive, isn't she?
very.
here we go.
it symbolises vengeance or revenge.
but it's more specific than that.
it's avenging an act perpetrated against a member of your family and the vengeance must be paid in blood.
every half-life that's ever crawled through a sewer is gonna be baying for Luke's blood. Step.
well, that narrows it down.
I think it's time we went to pay old big ears a visit.
charming.
this place stinks.
Hello, Luggs.
you.
what do you want?
I wanna know if you've heard anything about Luke Van Helsing.
what's the word around the sewers?
there is no word. I don't hear nothing!
now, that's the problem.
you stop hearing things, you start losing your privileges.
you're just another half-life who needs grading and smiting.
are you hearing this?
there's nothing to hear.
what do you want me to do?
leave the equipment alone!
get off! Don't touch my ears.
there is one thing. I did hear one thing.
Really? Talk.
I did hear a rumour that someone's after the Van Hesling boy.
Helsing. - Who?
well, it's just talk. I don't know.
let me ask around and I'll give you a call.
you find out who it is for me...
.or I'm gonna slice you up and turn you into a dwarf salami.
Hey, what's up?
I was in the neighbourhood. Thought you might like a ride home.
cos that sounds like the sort of thing you do.
it's 100 metres.
come on, admit it, you were missing me.
no. Race you.
I won.
how's college?
something is definitely up.
it's not a complicated question.
it's you. You're making small talk. You don't do small talk.
you have no idea of the things I do and don't do.
I didn't know we were dating.
that is a really horrible thought.
have you noticed any half-life activity? Seen anything suspicious?
here we go.
I ain't seen a thing.
what's going on?
well, there's a rumour going round that a half-life's coming after you.
I'm the last Van Helsing. Aren't they always after me?
this is different. So I want you to stay home.
you lock your doors and don't go out for anything??
see, now you've got me worried.
well, it's just a precaution till we know what we're dealing with.
OK.
Oh, Luke, if you see anything suspicious, you let me know.
are you all right, goddess?
???
??
I'm not gonna lend you my phone. You'll nick it.
you're calling me a thief, yeah?
don't make me hurt you.
I know kung fu.
come on, then. - Get off!
show me your moves. - Get off!
you know nothing.
lads, seriously, three of you hassling one girl?
is that not a bit embarrassing?
is it?
and what are you gonna do about it?
I know kung fu.
man, what is this?
are you two in some kung fu club or something?
no, seriously, I know kung fu.
actually, it's more a blend of various martial arts.
who is this guy?
how about we all just walk away, yeah?
you three go that way and we'll go this way. How about it?
I'm gonna mess you up, man.
I told you I could do kung fu.
you all right?
Hi. I'm Luke. From the canteen? The thirsty guy.
which way are you going? I'll walk you there.
so I didn't get your name?
that's cos I never said it.
right. So what is it?
look, you really don't have to walk me home.
it's fine.
so, how come you just started at college?
I just moved here.
if you need someone to show you round, I'll be your tour guide.
I'm from up north, but I know pretty much everything there is to know about London.
OK, so what's that building?
I have absolutely no idea.
what about that one, do you know what that is?
Nope.
that one?
well, it's not Buckingham Palace.
some tour guide you are.
Hey, at least I know Kung Fu.
I have to go.
so what is your name?
it's Alice.
see you at college, Alice.
Hello, Luggs.
this better be good.
Oh, it is.
I'm on my way.
see you in an hour.
OK.
you know the place? - "Yeah.
Yeah.
you fungus-faced dwarf.
you don't want to keep me waiting, my friend.
Oh, dear. - What is it?
it's Luggs.
he's toast.
mina, run!
what the hell was that?
Hi. - Hi.
how's things?
any more trouble on the mean streets of London town?
no.
are you doing anything later? I thought maybe we could go out.
I've got plans.
tomorrow? - I'm busy.
Thursday? - I can't.
how about the weekend?
OK. I get the message.
I'm going now before this gets any more embarrassing.
meet me here, five o'clock.
I thought you had plans?
I guess they just changed.
I thought I told you to stay home?
I've got to hand in an essay.
that makes me feel so much better, knowing you risked your life to stay on top of your homework.
get in.
what's this?
this is your new home.
you've got to be kidding?
do I look like I'm kidding?
last night, we had a close encounter with the half-life that's after you.
staying here is the only way we can guarantee your safety.
it's only until we find it.
look, I'll stay at home. I won't go to college. I won't go out. I'll do anything.
but I won't live down here.
that is a really dumb move, Luke.
Yeah, well, it's my life.
you don't have a life. You have a job. You're no use to us dead.
I'm sorry to hear my death would be such an inconvenience to you.
ruby, it's Galvin.
I've got a little job for you.
Hiya. What's up? You wanna hang out? I've got pizza.
what?
did Galvin tell you to keep an eye on me?
no.
since when does Galvin ask me to do anything?
if you ask me, he's sexist. Let's watch telly.
no, I can't.
why not? Are you going out?
no. I've got college work to do.
I'll give you a hand. - I don't need a hand.
I just need to get on with it.
american hot with extra pepperoni. Your favourite.
I already ate.
well, how about I watch telly while you do your work?
I can't concentrate with you here. Go eat your pizza somewhere else.
I can't eat all this by myself.
do you know how many calories are in one of these?
I don't care.
do you want me to get fat?
Yes.
see you. - Killjoy.
have you found anything yet?
nothing so far.
OK, so we got a teenage boy killed in Greenwich Park.
could be its hunting ground.
maybe we should stake it out.
we could always use Ruby as bait.
it looks fine. - Hi.
so Mr Tour Guide, what's the plan?
do you want to go to the beach?
come on.
that's it, I've found it.
it's a harpy.
grade ten.
nasty.
why is it after Luke?
do you want some sun block?
does it look like I'm burning?
we should have brought our swimming stuff.
I'll get us some ice-creams.
???
fancy seeing you here.
I can't believe you lied to me.
you said you were doing college work. You lied to ME.
because I didn't want you following me.
this wasn't my idea.
I was just looking out for you.
so, is this like a date?
you're leaving right now.
you can't make me. This is a public place.
so embarrassing!
you can tell Galvin he can't stop me living my life and if he wants to try, you know where I am.
just take her anywhere away from here.
there you go.
it's freezing.
so? - Oh, come here, you've got...
you are dead!
No! No!
not in the water! It's cold, it's cold!
say please.
harpy - from the Latin Harpyia.
the ancient Greeks believed they were winged death spirits.
it says they're half-woman, half-beast.
sometimes they're identified with sirens.
they target men and lure them to their death.
there were three harpies - Aello, Celaeno and Ocypete.
sisters.
1554 - Pieter Van Helsing hunted and killed two of the harpies.
he burned them alive.
OK, so I'm guessing the remaining sister was pretty unhappy about that.
she's looking for some kind of payback.
vengeance.
and Luke just so happens to be the last Van Helsing.
what? - Nothing.
you don't give much away, do you?
and you do?
ask me anything you like.
OK.
your parents
what do they do?
my mum's a teacher.
my dad died.
when I was one. A car crash.
you miss him, don't you?
I know it's silly, missing someone you never knew.
no, it's not.
it's like I've got this sense of him.
I don't know if it's right or if it's how I like to think of him.
you feel empty.
did you lose someone?
it was a long time ago.
I never really talk about this with anyone.
I'm glad you did.
in 1554, Pieter Van Helsing was called to Rotterdam.
he writes of the siren song of the harpy luring sailors to their death.
wait a minute, wait a minute.
well, I'll be damned. Mina.
before a harpy looks like a harpy, it looks like a girl.
so a woman and a beast, but at different times.
that puts a whole new spin on things. We're looking for a girl.
what's with all the urgent messages?
what's going on?
the word is, you got yourself a new girlfriend.
what, so now I'm not allowed a girlfriend?
not this one.
Alice isn't who she says she is.
what are you talking about?
we hacked into the college's system and checked her registration form. It's all lies.
you're spying on her?
we can't find any trace of her parents.
no birth certificate, no National Insurance number.
it appears she came out of nowhere.
maybe she uses her middle name. People do that.
Luke, your girlfriend's a half-life.
what's this?
this is what she turns into.
looks kinda different without her makeup, huh?
this is insane.
whatever this thing is, it's not Alice. Trust me, I'd know.
you wouldn't, not until it's too late.
you wanna take a look at what she can do?
there's a teenager lying on a slab in a morgue the other side of town.
of all the girls in London, Alice just happens to be a harpy? Come on.
?? It's not a coincidence. She's the thing after you.
because a girl can't possibly fancy me.
she's crazy about you. That's why she's planning on killing you.
so now she wants to kill me?
turns out there seems to be a bit of history between your families.
Pieter Van Helsing torched Alice's sisters. Now she's looking for some kind of revenge.
none of this proves Alice is a harpy.
you're absolutely right. That's why we need to abduct her.
you're gonna abduct an 18-year-old?
no, a 3000-year-old half-life.
try it. You'll have to come through me first.
well, this is intense.
stay away from her.
Luke! Wait!
galvin's lost it. He's stepped over the line.
just hear me out. We've got a plan.
a plan that involves kidnapping the girl I'm seeing?
it's the only way we can be sure.
look, Pieter Van Helsing discovered wormwood affects the central nervous system, kick-starting the transformation.
fine.
I'll give her some wormwood. Then we'll see.
??? She needs to be restrained and in a secure environment when we give it to her.
we don't want anyone to get hurt.
what about Alice?
she could get hurt. - It's the only way, Luke.
if she turns into a harpy, then...
we do what needs doing.
and if she doesn't?
we'll be very apologetic.
you're as bad as Galvin.
I saw something, Luke.
I saw you lying on the ground. You were bleeding.
was I dead?
I don't know.
where do we find her?
I'm meeting her at five o'clock at the entrance to Borough Market.
I don't want to be there when you do it.
OK, there's not too many people around when she shows up.
we'll put her in the back of the car.
OK.
Hi. - Hi.
come in.
I'll get us some drinks.
is beer all right?
Yeah, it's fine.
do you wanna sit down over here?
Thanks.
something about this doesn't feel right.
I'll give Luke a call.
I love your Mum's flat.
you can get it if you like.
it's fine. They'll leave a message.
are you OK?
Yeah. Cool. Cheers.
someone really wants to talk to you.
it's probably nothing. Ignore it.
two seconds.
hello.
no, you've got the wrong number.
sorry about that.
Cheers.
Alice was never coming. Come on.
where is she?
she's gone.
I spiked her drink.
you know what happened?
nothing.
nothing happened.
you sent us off on some wild goose chase. You could've been killed.
I wasn't. Cos Alice isn't a harpy.
you never lie to me again, you understand this?
you were gonna abduct her.
sure she drank this? Something's wrong.
Yeah, you were wrong.
your feelings are messing with your judgement. You can't allow that to happen.
maybe it's your feelings that are messing with your judgement.
you ever think about that?
I am sorry a half-life killed your wife.
I can't be like you.
there's more to life than grading and smiting.
not for me and you. It's all or nothing.
you're obsessed.
you see half-lifes even when they're not there.
seriously, you should take some time out.
we don't have the luxury. We're fighting a war.
Alice isn't part of your war.
everyone's part of it. Most of them just don't know about it yet.
I think you should go.
???
Hello?
I'm from down the hall. Is everything all right in there?
I got your message. What's up?
you were right.
it was all lies.
everything.
I'm so sorry.
I've never felt this way about a girl before.
she turns out to be a half-life who wants to kill me.
so this is my life.
no, she was just a lying harpy bitch.
it's always going to be like this.
I'll be lying to them or they'll be lying to me.
mina said I'll never have a normal relationship.
she's right.
no.
you just got the wrong girl.
how can I expect anyone to be a part of this?
maybe it's better I'm on my own.
the girl who's right for you, she'll accept you for who you are.
she'll always be there for you, no matter what.
yeah?
well, if you meet that girl, give her my number.
I've got to tell Galvin.
he's gonna love this.
galvin, it's me.
Alice is meeting me at the club at eight.
you want me to take a look at that?
probably a bit of dirt jamming up the cocking mechanism.
it causes friction.
friction...
.is bad.
this is not gonna be easy for you, Luke. I know you like this girl. But it has to be done.
you sure you don't wanna sit this one out?
I have to do this.
she's here. She's coming in.
OK, Luke, let's get the job done and get outta here. This place is making me feel kinda old.
Hi.
??
you look amazing. - Thanks.
let's go this way.
you know, it's girls like her that give women a bad reputation.
if only he could find a nice girl to settle down with.
I got you a beer. - Thanks.
so, whose party is this?
I know.
I know what you are.
the body in your kitchen kind of gave it away.
my friends say you came to kill me.
you wouldn't understand. - Try me.
if you're planning on killing a guy after the second date, tell him why.
a Van Helsing killed my sisters.
so you were going to kill a Van Helsing?
Yeah.
pretty much.
I can't let you keep on killing.
it ends now.
you're going to kill me?
you can do that?
not while you're like this.
you spiked my beer?
I'm going to wait until you turn.
I'm sorry.
what are you doing?
get on with it.
do it now.
I can't.
not like this.
OK, get out of the way.
we wait. - I said, get out of the goddamn...
get after her.
mina, Ruby, we've lost her.
cover the front entrance.
you look great.
so this is it.
I have to be suspicious of every girl I meet from now on.
so what's new?
they're always trying to hide something.
you know, Ruby thinks you're sexist.
Really?
well, she thinks you're cute.
so she's obviously wrong about most things.
just give me a minute.
I get nightmares.
beware of something nasty pretending to be something nice.
what else have you heard, Sandy?
he's been talking to mediums.
dad?
what are you up to?
drop the ball!
you're the last Van Helsing.
denial is not an option.
can I trust you?
let's call it by its name. You killed him.
it's my turn.
no, it's not.
it's my turn.
[Guard] Get ready for yard. - [Man shouting]
get ready for yard.
[Man 1] Fuck you! - [Man 2] What's his name again?
[Man 3] Fabrizio.
[Man 4] He's some kind of tough guy, man.
ready for yard, gentlemen.
yard line.
[Guard 1] Come on, let's bail out. - [Guard 2] Gangway! Move it!
move out!
go in and out, man! In and out!
[Man] I ain't even sweatin' you, man!
fuck 'em up, man! Come on, feed me, man!
fuck you!
always good! - [Laughter]
you're just a little punk, baby.
[Man] The morning it all began, began like any other morning.
Oh! Oh, Bernie.
dad, I need lunch money and a note for gym.
and you promised to help me with my book report, remember?
the author devotes a lot of time to developing the characters, and he seduces the reader by...
Seduces? - Yeah. He, uh, draws you in, you know?
you wanna know how it ends. - But I already knew how it ended.
OK, so write it was predictable.
no, Dad, I mean I've seen the movie. - Oh. Right.
come on. You got to eat.
can't you think of another word?
intrigues.
"Intrigues." Thanks, Mom.
you're smarter than Dad, you know that?
Yes, God help us if he finds out.
if Mom's so smart, maybe she should help you with your book report.
see what I mean?
I have a meeting, Dee. - Yeah, I have meetings too.
Amy, your book report, your call. Me or him?
I choose option O where you two get me a tutor.
Yep. We've been through this. - [Phone rings]
Oh, Jeez. - [Ringing continues]
where is it? - It's over there.
it's the hospital. - [Ringing]
Yep? - [Man] Is this Mr. Schine?
speaking.
I need to know if Amy's levels have changed.
no. No, the levels are the same. - We need the latest results.
Yep.
I'll fax it over when I get to work.
Thanks.
you going to the ATM?
who wants to live forever, right? - You have to stay positive.
at least it's not going up. - It's not going down, either, though.
positive.
Amy, your bus'll be here soon.
[Mother] Bye. - [Dog barks]
Bernie, you stay here.
you used to kiss each other goodbye in the mornings.
shut up.
come on.
the author intrigues the reader by twisting the narrative so you never know what's coming next.
how's that?
it's all right.
[Man over PA] The train on platform two is the 7.'50 Red Line service. [Woman] Ticket.
Oh, shit.
I meant to get one at the station. - Nine dollars.
Oh, gee. This is embarrassing. - And it's only Monday.
my wife, she, uh, emptied my wallet when she left for work this morning.
Oh, so it's the wife's fault, is it?
Yeah. I'm trying to explain. - It's nine dollars.
pay up or get off at the next stop.
it's that simple.
[Woman] I'll pay for him. - What?
no, no. You don't have to do that.
don't worry about it.
one lucky guy.
no, really. It's my fault.
it's all right. I paid, didn't I?
here you go. Thank you very much.
thank you.
just so you know, it wasn't an act or anything.
it was a shameless act, and I'm a born sucker.
just drop it.
I don't want you to think... - OK. I don't.
I mean, there's an ATM at Union if you're getting off there.
tomorrow is fine.
of course, there is a ten percent interest charge overnight.
interest charge. - Plus the handling fee.
never met a woman loan shark before.
you break legs too? - Just balls.
Oh. You're a lawyer.
I'm a financial adviser.
I cheat clients.
I'm a commercial executive.
I con housewives.
where do you work?
JMD/March. It's a midsize place.
we've got some semi-decent accounts. You?
Avery Price. It's a big place.
we don't do semi-decent accounts.
this your usual train? - Why?
so I'll know how to pay you back. - Nine dollars. I think I'll survive.
no, I gotta give it back.
I'd feel ethically impugned if I didn't.
Impugned?
well, I wouldn't want you to feel impugned.
so... If you take the same train tomorrow, I'll pay you back.
it's a date.
morning.
Hey. - What up, Chaz?
Ooh, yo, I got a good one for you.
seven players, 40-plus home runs, with 11 letters in their last names.
you got to spell that for me. - Morning, Charles.
Barry, I need a cash check.
how much and what for?
12, 000. Location fee for the Amerispend One shoot.
[Barry] Don't forget to sign the receipt this time.
for you, Barry, I'll sign it in blood. - [Barry] Heard that.
OK, that's one. I need six more.
Oh, Charles. Eliot's looking for you. - P-E-T-R-O...
Oh, come on, yo. That's only ten letters.
what else you got?
come on, Chaz, you got 'em all last week. I need this.
all right, Winston, any of these guys National Leaguers?
I thought it was Major League or Minor League. What's the National League?
you don't follow baseball? - No. Hockey's my game.
more gore, less bore. - Where'd you get the questions from?
this cop I know gives 'em to me.
actually, he's like my uncle.
he's obsessed. Loves challenging me.
said if I get it right, I get 100 bucks, and you know I gots to make that money.
wait. You don't know the answers?
no. Duh. That's why I come to you, Chaz.
where you been? You're late.
come on. - Sorry.
this is not a lady who likes to wait, you know.
Susan.
Charles. - Hi.
I guess you're here to raise our commission, eh?
we have some issues.
we feel like no matter how much we talk to you, we just don't get heard by you people.
this last commercial is a case in point.
we agreed on a strategy. We signed off on it.
then what happened?
you went off in all these other directions.
the cut you sent us, it's nothing like how we said it should be.
look, Susan, the directions I took were, you know...
I've been doing this for ten years, OK?
I'm sorry.
I'll do it however it is you want it done.
the time for apologies is over.
what we need now is change.
you don't want me on the account?
uh, Susan appreciates all you've done.
you have different visions.
you might have backed me up in there.
backed you up! Susan Davis is a $130 million client.
she's a bitch. - She's the worst kind of bitch.
she has a point. You're in a rut, my friend, and you know it.
forget Susan Davis.
get a new account, get back on your feet, back to what you do best.
goddamn it.
talk to me, tell me what's going on, maybe I can help.
impugned.
that's a word, isn't it?
[Charles] Shut up, Bernie. I live here. Amy, please!
[barking] - Bernie, cut it out.
you're late. - Sorry.
how was work?
work was fine. You?
guess who's decided to monitor me this week?
Ethan Jeffries. - Oh. The asshole.
he always throws a fit when I stray from the lesson plan.
there's a lot of that going around.
so, what did I do?
handed out an English composition in the math hour today.
he chew you out in front of the kids?
the title for the composition was "Why We Like Principal Jeffries."
uh, Jerry called. There's a message on the machine.
where you going?
I have a PTA meeting. It's been on the calendar for six weeks.
right. - [Bernie whimpering]
Amy needs to be quizzed for her history test, and Bernie needs to pee.
name the act that banned alcohol.
[Rock music playing] - Volstead Act.
what year? - 1919.
huh? - 1919.
Yeah. Do you think we can turn this down a notch below deafening?
Amy!
OK.
how long...?
how long did Prohibition last? - Fourteen years.
[Woman] Pay up, buster.
Hey.
I looked for you.
Yeah, right. Gimme my money.
really. I did.
is that your daughter? - Yeah.
Amy. - Oh.
mine's a few years younger.
what's her name? - Amber.
Oh, she's adorable. - Yeah.
they make it all worth it, don't they?
nice briefcase.
it was a gift... from my wife.
Oh, Jeez. Guess I should get one for my husband, huh?
if lost, please return to Charles. Christopher Schine.
Charles Christopher Schine. Isn't Schine a Jewish name?
Rabbinically. - Christopher Schine.
my mom was Catholic. I got all kinds of guilt.
Oh. How's that workin' out for you?
fine. I had a lot of therapy when I was a kid.
you're kinda funny, aren't you? - You're an easy crowd.
what's your name? - Lucinda.
Lucinda Harris.
so we came here when I was little, just me and my mom.
we were only gonna stay a year. - Mm-hm.
how about you? - Oh, all over.
I was an Army brat. I grew up everywhere and nowhere.
my address changed every six months, and so did my best friend.
but, then again, I got to change too.
if I screwed up in Fort Hood, Texas, they didn't have to know about it in Saratoga, New York.
I could just be this whole other person.
that happen a lot? You screwing up?
Mm-hm. Yep.
I was the consummate rebel against authority.
Oh, is that what you called it? - No, that's what my parents called it.
I called it gettin' lit.
but then I got my act together when I got out of school, and Dad really wanted a lawyer.
he settled for a banker.
[Man over PA] The next stop is Chicago Union Station.
this is the end of the Red Line.
all passengers, please disembark at this time.
thank you.
busy day?
Oh, in finance, every day is a busy day.
Oh, I bet you're getting a lot of angry calls with an economy like this.
well, if you consider death threats angry.
tell me about it.
clients, they love you when times are good...
no, no, no, when times are good, you never make them enough money.
there's always some cousin or brother or grandmother whose stock split 64 ways, and why can't you sell 'em one of those, like I got some crystal ball or something.
tell me about it. I got fired off my biggest account.
my boss didn't even warn me. Supposed to be a good friend of mine.
that bastard. Do you want me to yell at him for you?
give me his number, I'll crank-call him.
some people just don't know how to appreciate what they've got.
[Woman] Morning, Charles.
[Man] Yes, sir.
what up, Chaz? - Hey.
you all right? You look a little sick in the face, - like you got the bug. - No.
it ain't contagious, is it? - It's nothing.
that's what Dick Lembergh said. - Who's Dick Lembergh?
ain't nobody now. That motherfucker dead.
Winston.
come here. Let me ask you something.
this about the computers? - No, no.
I appreciate what you did for me.
forget about it. Buy me a beer sometime. This is something else.
go ahead. Shoot for it.
say you went to the movies, but you forgot your money, and someone offered to buy your ticket for you.
in Chicago? - I'm just saying, hypothetically.
it's only right to talk to them, isn't it?
I mean, thank them. Show you appreciate it somehow, right?
this full price or matinee?
that's the difference between five or ten bucks, man.
you know what?
never mind.
Hey, yo. I asked that cop about those questions, and three other players were National League.
I'm still working on that.
I need those answers by tomorrow to get that moola, baby.
we're cool about the computers, right? - Yes, Winston. We're cool.
Chaz.
we're cool about the computers, right?
[Woman] Avery Price.
Lucinda. - You mean Luclnda Harrls?
Yeah. Could you tell her it's Charles Schine?
I'll put you through to her office.
[Lucinda] Charles. - Hey.
we have this beautiful house in Lake Forest, just the kind of house I dreamed about as a kid.
what's your husband do?
he golfs. - For a living?
he wishes.
no, he's a broker. We met at Stanford.
he's up at 3am so he can be in the offices when London opens.
we also have an apartment in the city.
he stays there during the week to avoid the commute, and of course, the weekends are for golf.
so when do you see each other?
the usuals.
birthdays, Christmases.
we communicate mainly via Hallmark.
but hey, I have a beautiful, wonderful baby girl, so there.
Deanna!
Amy. Amy!
can you hear me?
can you hear me, sweetheart?
breathe. Breathe, Amy.
breathe. There you go.
daddy's here. It's OK.
everything's OK. Daddy's here.
there you go.
there you go, sweetheart.
stay with me.
there you go. There you go.
it's OK, sweetheart. It's OK.
Amy. There you go.
it's all right, baby. - There you go.
diabetes? - Type 1. Worst kind.
we took out a second mortgage on the house to get her one of those mobile dialysis machines so she doesn't have to go to the hospital every day.
can't they, um...? Can't they give her a new kidney?
they have. Three times.
her body keeps rejecting them.
there's this new anti-rejection drug coming out, supposed to be amazing.
has to be approved, but they say it's got a 99 percent rate - of success in the tests so far. - Expensive?
like you wouldn't believe.
and, of course, insurance won't cover it.
sure. Probably cheaper to let her suffer, right?
we're OK.
we've been saving for years.
so now we just sit around and wait for the call.
Hi. Amy, don't let Bernie out.
[Charles] Hey. You home?
Yeah, just now. What's wrong?
I just got out of Eliot's office.
he slammed me with some big new account.
I'm gonna be home late, so, uh, don't wait up.
all right. How come you're calling from your cell phone?
Amy, your bag's in the back.
I don't know.
I'm just down the hall and wanted to let you know as soon as possible.
Thanks.
I'm sorry. It's been kind of hectic lately.
um, I gotta go.
all right. See ya.
Bye.
Yeah. All right, honey.
excuse me.
same again?
I'm drinkin' you under the bar, Mister.
Really? - Yeah.
I bet I can do it in three drinks. - You like to gamble?
it's not really gambling when you never lose.
I got a bet. - Really?
I'll bet you $20 that I can kiss you without ever touching your lips.
kiss me? - Without touching.
how?
what do you mean, how? That's the bet.
OK. Let me see the 20.
worth every penny.
what are we doing?
I've never done this before.
me neither.
all the years I've been married, never lied to my husband.
not once.
bartender! Johnny Walker Black Label, no ice, please.
bartender! Johnny Walker Black Label, no ice, please.
excuse us, please. - Oh, there she is. Hello, beautiful.
can I buy you a drink? - I have a drink.
can I buy you the bar then?
do yourself a favor, buy a better line.
excuse me, we're talking here.
no, buddy, we were talking, you were just...
you were standing looking like a fag.
OK, Charles... - Charles, you run along.
the lady and I are gonna get acquainted.
where you goin'? - Get your hands off me.
fine. Relax. You stupid whore.
[Man 1] Take it easy, buddy.
[Man 2] Can we get some ice, please?
[Man] Taxi!
[Man] Taxi!
[Charles] That one? - No. My husband meets clients there.
Hey, how about that one?
you OK? - Yeah.
stop the cab, please. - [Driver] Sure, lady.
I can't, Charles. I'm sorry.
[Charles] Keep the change. - [Driver] Thanks, buddy.
good luck with her.
I know, I know.
how much for a room? - Forty-six dollars.
you want to use the hotel safe? It's an extra ten.
no, just the room, please.
it's that way.
[Woman]... 45 minutes waiting for you to come upstairs.
[Man] I was stressed. I had a drink.
[Woman] What do you mean, stressed, a drink?
[Woman] What about me? What about me?
[Man] Just shut the fuck up! What is wrong with you?
[Woman] I won't shut the fuck up. It is 3: 00 in the morning.
beautiful.
so, what do you think?
you wanna stay, or you wanna go?
I don't know.
I think, um...
I think I wanna fuck you.
you make one sound, I'll blow your fuckin' heads apart.
always chain your door in a place like this.
but, hey, thanks for the invite.
I'll give you all my money.
[Grunts] - "No sound" means you shut the fuck up.
please don't hurt him. - You get that?
give me your fuckin' wallets now.
come on, give me your wallet. Come on, come on.
this doesn't look like her...
...Charlie.
that stupid fuck doesn't look like you, neither.
Lucinda. You two fuckin' around, huh?
SLUMMIN' it, ain't ya?
you're fuckin' slummin' it, you piece of shit.
isn't that exciting?
please, just take the money.
Chuck, I already took your money.
you see this? This was your money, and I took it. Now it's mine.
I promise we won't go to the police. - I know you won't 'cause you look like a nice guy. Ain't you a nice guy?
you look nice to me.
she looks kinda nice. Are you nice? - [Whimpering]
Lucinda.
Oh! No!
let her go, please. - Come on, come on.
please. - How can I let her go, such a fine piece of ass like that?
look at that.
me and fuckin' Lucinda, we gotta do a lot of things together.
all kinds of shit.
I could make you scream, you know?
is she better than your wife at home? Ha.
[sobbing] - Look at that.
What'd you say, Charlie?
I can fuck her? Well, thanks... Charlie.
I knew you were a nice guy.
Whoa! Where you goin', Lucinda?
you gonna take it from him, or you gonna go for a whole lot more?
[Speaking French]
[Speaking French]
check this out, Charlie.
championship fuckin', right here.
twelve rounder. - No.
Oh, please. - Shut up!
Yeah, you don't wanna miss this. - No!
Hey, Chuck, fuck her like that.
come on, Chuck. Don't fail me, man.
round four coming up.
[Lucinda] No, stop, please!
I'll take you to a hospital.
I'm so sorry.
I'll call the police.
no. No.
we... We gotta give a description.
stop. Stop it.
the police are gonna wanna know what we were doing here.
so we tell them.
we have to.
can't.
Oh, my God, my family.
well, what do you want me to do?
tell me what to do.
I just want you to get me out of here.
55 East Erie, please.
holy shit, Chaz.
[Woman] Oh, my God! - Looks like you got hit by a train.
I'm OK. I'm fine.
I just had a little accident. - What the hell happened?
I got mugged. - Jesus.
I've just been to the hospital. Doctor said I'm good. No permanent damage.
you get a look at this guy, Chaz? - No.
you call the police?
they're gonna call me if my wallet turns up.
maybe you oughta go home. Did you call Deanna?
Yeah.
there's just, um, a couple of things I gotta do.
um... Cancel my credit cards.
call the DMV. - Charles.
don't be stupid.
go home. OK?
goddamn city.
I hate it.
[Charles] I work in the city, Dee.
I can't just quit my job. What would I do?
you could teach again.
you used to be a great teacher.
my job is what allows us to save for Amy's drugs.
how do we do that on a pair of teachers' salaries?
we could sell the house.
we've already got two mortgages on the house.
selling it doesn't do us any good.
mom?
Yeah. Hi, sweetie.
Deanna, can you get that?
Dee! - Excuse me.
just give me a minute.
Yeah.
[Man] Hey, Charlie.
Charlie? Can you hear me?
what do you want? How did...? - Well, how's your busted nose?
still hurtin'? - Why are you calling me?
just checkin'out if you were keeping your promise about the police and all.
cause after all, a promise is a promise, huh?
[Deanna] Hello? - I got it. It's business.
a business call. Honey, for God's sake.
excuse me. Who's this?
[Man] Well, this is Mr. LaRoche.
Mr. LaRoche, my husband's had a rough day.
can this wait? - [LaRoche] What happened?
[Deanna] He was mugged. - [LaRoche] Charles, I had no idea.
please, I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me so?
honey, can you hang up, please?
OK, hon.
so you haven't told her. Huh? Have you?
you haven't told your wife you're fuckin' Lucinda.
you listen to me, you fuckin' asshole!
you go near her again, I swear to God...
I need a loan, Charlie.
I really hate to ask, but I'm a little short, and since you canceled your credit cards, well, you know what? I need 20, 000.
that's ridiculous. I don't have 20, 000.
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, you're a big fuckin'executive.
I don't have that kind of cash just lyin' around.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, man, I just don't give a shit about your cash flow.
I want 20, 000 now, you hear me?
OK, OK. I'll get it.
what'll you get?
I want to hear it because, you know, [French accent] My English is not very good.
I'll get you the 20, 000.
[Normal accent] OK. Well, thank you, Charlie.
corner of Western and Parkway, noon, Friday.
don't ever call me at home again... - Au revoir, Charlie.
you OK?
I haven't seen you on the train all week.
I've called in sick the whole week.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
so he called you. - I think we should go to the police.
No! No, Charles. You're not understanding me.
if my husband finds out that I had an affair, he will file for divorce. He will do anything.
what do you mean?
he'll take my daughter.
Really? - Yes.
you don't know him. He's not like you.
now this is all I can spare without my husband noticing.
no. No way. No. I'll take care of it.
I just wanted to make sure you're OK.
I don't think we should see each other anymore.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
I want to see you.
I can't, Charles. I'm sorry. I can't.
what?
where you goin'?
come on, we're talkin' to you.
fuck you don't watch where you goin'? - Sorry.
sorry don't pay the bills, white boy.
sorry don't stop world wars or feed the poor.
as far as I'm concerned, sorry's for shit.
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
Charlie, is it?
your name Charlie?
Yeah. - Call you Chuck?
Where's LaRoche? - I'll take you to him.
fuck you think I'm here for, conversation?
look, why don't I just give you the money?
Hey, you're not givin' me shit, you understand?
you gotta see Frenchie.
up against the wall, and don't fuckin' move!
so you write commercials, huh?
Yeah.
I made this demo for this coffee commercial this one time.
it was a fine piece of music.
Really? - Yeah.
What'd they say?
they said people who drink coffee don't like rap.
that's ridiculous. - That's what I said.
so, uh, if I get somethin' to you, you give it a listen, uh, see what you can do with it?
Yeah. Sure. - Huh.
[LaRoche] Hey.
Charlie.
man, you look like shit.
nice briefcase, though.
Thanks, Charlie.
that's for canceling your credit cards.
it is a nice briefcase. - It is a nice briefcase.
keep your head up, homey. [laughs]
I don't often go into the city.
but when I do,
I find comfort in the knowledge that my Amerispend One card...
I... I... What's...
Susan Davis calls this retro avant-garde.
I think it's more retro avant-crap.
Eliot, I'm in trouble.
what kind of trouble?
I cheated on Deanna.
you never cheated before? - No.
everybody cheats. You know what? Everybody gets over it.
no, this is different. - Everybody says that too.
don't worry, you'll be fine. - There's this man...
I don't want to know who it was with.
look, buy Deanna some flowers. Talk it over with her.
try not to get caught next time.
now, for God's sake, will you help me fix this piece of crap?
[Woman 1] You think I should? - [Woman 2] Yeah.
[Winston whistles] Chaz.
what up, yo? - Hey.
Ah, man, welcome back.
how long has it been?
high school.
high school.
man, the best three years of my life, man.
all the pussy you could imagine, 4. 0 GPA, everything good till they locked my ass away.
what were you in for?
me? I was what they call a recreational drug user.
and that's it?
I was also a recreational drug distributor.
you know, a little H, some dope, digi.
so how was it?
man, nothin' but the best.
I sold a pure commodity at a fair market price.
no. Prison.
prison's like walkin' a tightrope.
you try not to get involved.
actin' like you're blind 24 hours a day.
this shit takes a shit load of concentration.
I mean, when I first got in that joint, man, I was prime meat.
I was what they call unaffiliated.
so, what'd you do?
[Scoffs] I got affiliated.
I had to stick a shank up in some kid.
what, you killed him? - [Elevator dings]
your back is up against the wall, and it's you or him, you gotta do what you gotta do.
Yeah. This is Charles.
[LaRoche] You ever get a little sidetracked, Charlie?
I need another loan, Charlie.
now listen. Listen to me.
I've got no more money for you.
OK. OK, man. You win.
[Scoffs] You want me to leave you alone,
I'll leave you alone.
no problem.
for $100, 000, though.
fuck you.
tsk. You ain't that smart.
anybody ever told you that?
how'd you get this number?
that's it. Keep thinking like that.
how did I get your cell number?
it isn't listed, is it?
you called my wife.
Ah, no. Guess again.
OK, I'll give you a clue.
on this phone, it's speed dial number eight.
hospital one, doctor two.
you're number eight. [laughs]
you don't even rate in the top five.
how does that feel, Charlie?
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, yeah.
Hey! Here's my man.
you OK? You look like you ran a marathon.
what?
what did you say to him on the phone?
well, in our business one has to know how to light a fire under people.
it's the best way to get things done. Do you not agree, Charles?
what's going on here? - Mr. LaRoche needs you to sign off on that thing he called about.
did you think I would not come? - No, I thought you got the message.
I'm sorry. I'm confused.
but you look so out of shape, Charles.
sit down and catch your breath for a second.
[Deanna] I'll pour coffee. - You don't know how many times - I told him to join my tennis club. - What?
you know Charles. He prefers to follow sports, not play them.
but one has to keep fit in today's world 'cause you never know when you'll need to be at your fighting best.
please.
he's right. You might have been able to outrun that mugger.
Oh. Well, from what Charles told me, that thug had a jump on him from the very start.
this is crazy. You never had a chance, did you?
I'm gonna get him back.
you're not getting anyone back. You have a family.
you're so right, Deanna, so right.
you wanna protect your family 'cause at the end of the day, this is the most important thing in the whole world.
mom, have you seen my sketchbook? - Get back upstairs.
go do your homework. - Charles.
Amy, this is Mr. LaRoche. He works with your father.
come here, beauty. [laughs]
[Speaking French]
it means, " like a little stone that's rolling down the river."
so cute.
may I kiss you? - Mm-hm.
you know, we were looking at your drawings.
they're lovely. Truly beautiful.
thank you.
such a talent.
you know, when I first came to this beautiful country,
I spent quite a lot of time in New York.
and if you allow me, of course,
I could show these to some very prominent art dealers.
that sounds great.
how about we go sign off on this contract?
Oh, yes, business is business, of course.
Bye-bye. - [Amy] Bye.
she's so cute.
I'll be up soon, honey.
how old is she?
you get the fuck out of my house. - What did you say?
get out. - I beg your pardon.
What'd you say?
you don't like that, huh?
you upper-crust motherfucker. Huh?
you got it all, and yet you're ready to fuck it up for just a bit of pussy?
fuck... - Shh, shh, shh, shh.
a hundred thousand dollars, and I just might give you back your balls, bitch.
you hear me?
say it. OK? OK?
Yeah, nice boy.
OK... OK.
well... au revoir. Thanks for having me.
au revoir. - I'll see you soon. Bye.
he seems like a lovely guy.
[Jerry] Why didn't you call me when this whole thing began?
[Jerry] Why didn't you call me when this whole thing began?
I'm supposed to be your first call, Charles.
I don't need a lecture, I need to know my options.
look, she's gotta come forward.
I told you, she can't do that.
we need a statement on the record. - Jerry, he was in my house.
with my family.
he didn't break in. He didn't touch them.
he didn't threaten them. - Jerry. He broke my nose.
OK, show me the police report.
did you go to the police when you got beat?
so...
so you've done nothing about this for six weeks, and now suddenly you want me to file a complaint?
you've got to get her to come forward.
anything else is just... pissing in the wind.
what are you doing here? - I spoke to my lawyer.
we have to go to the police. - We can't go to the police.
listen to me.
we didn't sleep together. - It's the same thing.
because we didn't fuck doesn't mean we didn't cross the line.
we went to the hotel. We started to do it.
and we didn't stop out of the conscience of our hearts.
exactly. We were attacked.
I had an abortion, Charles.
what?
why didn't you tell me?
I... I could have helped. I could have done something.
done what, Charles?
what could you have done?
Oh! Snap his back, man!
smack him! Referee, that's a penalty!
sorry, you know I get zoned to this hockey shit, Chaz, man.
OK, I'm listening.
so, what do you think I should do?
shit, I don't know, man. But you see how it works, though, right?
he lures you in with 20 grand. Folks like you could pull together 20 grand if you had to, right?
you think, 20 grand, bong, and he's gone, right?
Nah. It's not about that.
he wanna see if you're the kind of asshole who pays.
then after that... [imitates whip cracking]
...slap the big dick on you, hit you for the real cheese, the big bucks.
that's what this game is all about, Chaz.
Thanks, Winston, I feel much better now.
you're a wild cowboy, yo.
well, can you pay him?
technically, yeah, I have the money.
shit, yo, so pay him, man, be done with this.
I can't. It's put away for something else.
it's years of savings. Can't touch it.
I don't know what to do. I'm going out of my fuckin' mind here.
it's there everywhere I turn. - Calm down, Chaz.
look, man, drink your beer.
shit, that ain't even strong enough right now.
O'malley, let us get a double Scotch and hold the rocks.
let me tell you something.
I spent five years in the joint with motherfuckers like this.
the first thing you must understand about a rapist is that they pussies.
they weak. They prey on the weak.
so, what do you think I should do?
[Exhales] Listen, man, I like you, 'cause you're different than the rest of them.
I don't like to see you in no position like this.
so I'm gonna do you a solid.
I'm gonna scare this pussy off your back for you.
no. No, no, no. - Listen, I owe you.
you caught me stealin' those computers, you coulda dropped a dime on me,
I'd have been locked up for three more years.
Winston, you owe me nothing. - Look at it this way then.
let's make it a business proposition.
instead of you giving this motherfucker 100K, you could pay me, say, ten percent?
Yeah, $10, 000 in cash, and I'll scare that Pepe Le Pew motherfucker all the way back to France.
hurry up. - [Giggling]
[Gasps] Thank you! - Happy birthday.
[Deanna] Look at this one.
[Amy] That's nail polish. - Nail polish? Is it?
Yeah.
what's that one? - Here.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Oh, thank you.
[Woman] Thank you. Goodbye.
Charles, this just came in for you.
[Woman] We'll see you tonight. - Yeah. Bye-bye, pretty girls.
[Woman] Good morning, JMD/March.
no, I'm sorry. That's OK.
OK, no problem. Goodbye.
[Man] Yeah? - Barry. It's me.
I need a cash check for this aspirin spot.
another one?
how much you want this time? - Ten thousand.
you come down here, and you sign for it yourself, yeah?
Thanks.
[Winston] Hey, yo, Chaz.
you know what my favorite song is?
"get Money." B.I.G. And Lil' Kim.
my favorite artists?
and Johnny motherfuckin' Cash, baby.
Oh, let me tell you my favorite reverends.
Frederick Price and Oreflo Dollar. - Yes, Winston, I have your money.
who's talkin' money here, Chaz?
just tryin' to make conversation, man.
you OK, Chaz? - Yeah.
let me turn this up for you, baby, get a crack on this motherfucker.
Uh-oh. Ching-ching.
love the smell of fresh money, yo.
[whistles] - Jesus.
you're gonna shoot him?
I ain't gonna shoot him. I'm gonna scare his monkey-ass off your back.
it's not even loaded.
but it's like an old gangsta proverb, yo.
you ain't gotta use force, but you gotta project strength.
project strength. Right.
got it. - Chaz, my good buddy, it's time you got affiliated, man. Come on, take that.
is this the one you used...?
that's the one, yo. That's for good luck.
I'm gonna run inside this joint first, scope it out.
when you feel comfortable, you come on in.
we got maybe a hour before this bastard shows up.
you're gonna be close, though, right?
I'm gonna be close. Don't worry. I got your back.
it's like in the movies and shit, the bad guy is always one step ahead, right?
so we gotta be two steps ahead of this crazy motherfucker...
Charlie...
Oharlie.
this doesn't look like 100 to me.
God almighty. You killed him.
you brought him, you fuckin' piece of shit, and this isn't good for our relationship.
Oh, Jesus.
[Woman] Asshole! - [Man] Fuck you!
you coulda been coming instead of going!
want a date, hon?
Hey, you. You by the car.
you lookin'?
no. No, I-I'm fine.
what about him?
maybe he wants a date.
I don't think so.
what's wrong with him? He drunk?
Yeah. Yeah, he's... he's drunk, OK.
you got a light?
I... I don't smoke.
you don't smoke, you don't drink, you don't fuck. What do you do?
get outta here. - What? Hey, screw you!
[Sirens] - Don't tell me to get outta nowhere.
[Officer 1] What's up, Candy? - Hey, Joe.
[Officer 2] Hey, Candy.
keepin' safe? - You know me.
I'm careful these days.
[Officer] Hey, you! Conducting a transaction with Candy here?

what? Somethin' wrong with her?
no, she's great. - Great, huh?
you married? - Yes.
your old lady know you're trolling for hookers?
I-I'm not. Look... - How 'bout your buddy? He married?
he's drunk.
if he's drunk, what's he doing behind the wheel?
Hey, buddy! Hey, you there!
he's sleeping it off, sir.
the two of you were out trolling for hookers on a Wednesday, and neither of you were doing business with Candy here.
I'm sorry, I... - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
don't apologize to me.
tell her you're sorry.
Freezin' her ass off out here, and you two jokers don't even give her the time of day.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
we'll call it a deposit. Huh?
believe this guy?
[Officer 2] We're on the clock. - We're gonna circle the block.
I come back and you're still here,
I'm gonna take you and your buddy in.
see ya, Candy. - Take it easy, Candy.
see ya, Joe.
[Barry] I'm tired of you, Charles. I need that receipt for the aspirin spot.
I said you'll get it today, you will. - Today?
Yes. Lunchtime.
well, you better... - Oh, shit!
you OK?
folks in the mailroom asked me to bring this up to you.

What'd you say? - That's right.

Jesus.

are you the baseball stats guy? - Yeah.
Yeah, that's me. Baseball freak.
even played in the minors '79 to '82.
[Sighs] You know, I see these losers every day.

winston was different. He coulda got out.
the brother was no loser.
I'm sorry.
you own a gun, Mr. Schine? - No.
smith & Wesson 5906?

[Chuckling] Oh, no, of course not.
but we have to ask everybody. I mean, you know how it is.
so where were you last night?
here. Work. I was at work.
anyone... with you corroborate that?
do you mind? - No. No, no, I'll wait.
Yeah.
[LaRoche] What did you think? You could fuck with me, - you miserable piece of shit? Huh? - No.
[Lucinda groaning] - I've got your girl here.
do you understand me? I've got your little whore right here.
[Lucinda] Oh, God. Stop, please... - Where are you?
shut the fuck up! Dex, take care of her.
[Dexter] No problem.
[LaRoche] I don't like killlng, but if you're not here in 20 minutes, - I'm gonna put a bullet in her brain. - Don't.
and then one in Deanna. And sweet llttle Amy too.
I'm gonna klll all your women, do you understand?

Yeah, yeah, I do. I mean, I will. Just...

Uh-huh, 55 East Erle, apartment 4010. - Got it.

Yeah.

Oome on in. Don't be scared.
[LaRoche] Way!
Dex. You think I should count this, or... just trust him?

he looks like a trustable guy. - [Whimpers]
you fuckin' move, I'll kill you, bitch!
one motherfuckin'.
two motherfuckin'.
three.
I gave you the money! - What?
no, you didn't give me the money. You fuckin' made me kill for it.
keep something in mind, Oharles.
I'll always be one step ahead of you.
always.
well, my dear Dexter,
I think it's time to relocate.
Yeah. Relocate.
au revolr. - Mm-hm.
[LaRoche] Oongratulations, Oharlie.
you just bought your life back. [laughs]
are you OK?
I don't even...
they must have just followed me.
I didn't even... I don't know... They just... pushed their way in.
it's OK now.
are you sure that they're gone? - He's gone.
I paid him.
I paid him everything.
but your daughter...
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I should have... - I think it's over now.
you're safe.
my family's safe.
[Deanna] Hello?
Charles, Is that you? Hello?
[Man 1] See you, Sean. - [Man 2] See ya.
[Sean] Take care, guys.
you're a hard man to track down.
you're not at work, you're not at home...
this is where all you bored executive types go to drown your sorrows.
I've been meaning to call you.
[Chuckles] I'm sure.
you know, ever since he was a kid,
winston never could seem to catch a break.
you know who he always reminded me of?
Bobby Bonds.
unluckiest player to ever step up to the plate.
Bobby Bonds struck out 187 times in 1969, more than any other player in a single season, except one.
you know who?
Bobby Bonds. - [Chuckling] Bobby Bonds.
following year. 189 strikeouts.
now, that's unlucky.
this is my new buddy. Sean owns this place.
Hey, Sean, Scotch. Drop the rocks. - [Sean] Oomin' up, Frank.
Sean says you and Winston had a drink here recently.
mind telling me what you were talkin' about?
hockey. - Hockey. That's it?
there was a game on.
now, I still need to know where you were last night.
I told ya. I was workin'.
no one at your office can confirm. - I was alone.
OK, Mr. Schine.
maybe you'd be more comfortable talking to me with your lawyer.
why don't the two of you come by my office tomorrow morning?
and just so you know,
I'm gonna crucify the son of a bitch who killed Winston.
[Ohurch] See ya, Sean. - [Sean] Detective.
oharles?
Amy sleeping?
Yeah.
I've made a horrible mistake, Dee.
the money we put away for Amy...
...It's gone.
gone? - All of it.
what are you talking about?
I'm so sorry. - Well, where is it? Where is the money?
I'll figure it out. - Figure out what? What's going on?
I'll find a way. - What have you done?
tell me what you've done.
seven years of savings.
you fucking explain yourself! - I'll tell you, Dee.
I'll tell you everything.
and it's not just about the money.
[Jerry] Ah. Oome on, we're late.
I have to tell Lucinda first, Jerry.
no. I've called this detective twice already this morning.
he's a real hard-ass. - I have to.
you think this guy is fuckin' around? - I'll meet you down there.
so, what am I supposed to tell them? - Help me.
Oharles!
Lucinda Harris, please. - She's not in her office.
Oh, shit. - Oh, wait. Here she comes now.
no. No, no, no. Lucinda Harris. - Yeah?
no, you saw us here. Together.
twice. Remember? - I saw you with her temp.
temp? - Sure. You know, answered her phones occasionally, took long lunches, always late. A temp.
Jane something. She quit last week.
[Luclnda] I'm a flnanclal advlsor.
I cheat cllents.
[Woman] And it comes fully furnished, just like you see.

Yes, would you like a brochure?
it was rented. I was here.
well, it's available again now. Are you interested?
you rented it to a woman.
no, no, it was a couple. A woman and her boyfriend.
they left unexpectedly. Very nice couple.
you know them?
[Luclnda] They make It all worth lt, don't they?
Yes.
I do.

Bye-bye!
[LaRoche] What? - I'd like to get into the car.

[Jerry] Tell hlm everythlng. It's the only way out of thls.
[Oharles] What happens to Amy's money if they find him?
it's gonna be state's evldence. - And I never see it again?
no, I have to take care of this myself. It's the only way.
[Jerry] What are you talklng about?
[Oharles] Jerry, I have to get Amy's money back.
[Jerry] Charles, walt. Charles... - [phone dlsconnects]
uh, hi. I-I'd like a room, please. - Forty-six dollars a night.
you wanna use the hotel safe?
uh, no, thank you.
um...
I think it's this way.
Hey!
Hey, what's goin' on?
you can have my money. My wallet's on the table. Take it.
I don't want your money. They do.
they want it all. You're in a scam.
what? - A con.
these two were gonna take you for everything you've got.
I don't know what you're talking about.
who are you, and what do you want?
you met on the train, did you?
by accident. Just happened somehow.
and she was fuckin' sweet...
...and smart...
...and you couldn't believe how attracted she was to you.
she was just too good to be true.
she showed you this picture of her daughter.
everything this bitch told you was a lie.
not everything was a lie, Oharles.
he was just about to rob you, and then rape her.
only it wouldn't have been rape, would it?
I don't understand. Why would he rape her?
because it makes you feel guilty you didn't stop it...
...that you didn't protect her.
later on, she may even be as sick as to tell you she had an abortion.
so you don't go to the police. - I don't want any part of this.
there's a man waiting. - I have to leave...
No!
boy, you're getting better, Oharles.
I'm kind of proud of you. [groans]
I want... my fuckin' money back!
I want everything you took from me.
well...
I don't think that's gonna be possible, Oharlie.
just give him his money, and let's go.
he's a fuckin' mark, for Chris's sake.
that sweetie pie is worried about that little girl of yours.
[Lucinda] Oh, stop it! - She didn't look that sick to me.
just stop it!
[Man] Let me outta here! I'm gonna get outta here now!
I'm telling you, move away from the fucking door!
I'm gonna shoot! Get outta my way! I'm leaving
Ah!
[Dexter] Frenchie!
[Dexter] Ah!
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!
[Man] Step by step, what did you hear?
sir, there's no ID on the white male. Prints people are on it.
all right. See if he's on the register. Oheck what's in the hotel safe.
Yes, sir.
sorry about that. You were saying?
I heard the shots,
I saw the security guy run past, so I just... closed the door.
you did the right thing.
you don't know how may wannabe heroes I ship off to the morgue each week.
OK, Mr... Sheen? Schine? - Schine.
Schine.
all right, if we need anything more, we'll contact you.
[Ohurch] Hey. You seen Jones from Homicide?
Yes, sir. Yes, the, uh...
Vince, can we get the happy snappers out of here today?
I'm losin' the will to live.
Frank. What are you doing here, Frank?
where is it? - I'll show you.
heard you found a Smith & Wesson 5906.
Yeah, Ballistics has it. - What a mess.
Yeah, pretty straightforward.
a woman and the suit are having a thing.
they get mugged, security tries to help them... everybody gets shot.
[Ohurch] I'm interested in that gun, so please call me when you get the ballistics report.
sure.
Thanks. - OK, take care.
[Detective] Vince, can we get everybody out of here?
[Officer] I need a statement. - [Man] Gonna take long?
[Officer] Oouple minutes. - I don't got much time.
[Man] I was standing here.
[Officer 2] You got a lot in that safe.
I, uh...
I believe that's mine.
nice briefcase.
OK, what else you got?
[Man] Back it up there, back it up.
[Barry] No sign of it here, either.
all right, thanks.
what the hell is this?
all the years I've known you,
I never figured you for a thief, Oharles.
you want to tell me about the $10, 000 for the aspirin spot?
it was an emergency. I was gonna pay it back.
pay it back?
what am I, a bank?
and now you're stealing from it.
if I were to write a bill for what you owe me, what should I make it for?
it was just the once, I swear.
well, Barry'll be the judge of that.
so...
...tell me what was so important that you had to do this.
Oan't.
I can't tell you.
I want to, but I can't. I'm sorry.
fine. You wanna play it that way, I'll start proceedings.
proceedings?
he suspends you while we conduct an investigation.
just pay it back.
the most you'll get is community service.
keep stonewalling us, pal, you go to jail.
[Man] Hi there.
Heya, teach. - Hank, isn't it?
that's good.
I hate it when people don't remember your name.
go on through.
it's Oharles, by the way. - Right. Oharles.
did I ask you what you're in for yet? - Embezzlement.
that's not a bad deal.
six months teaching cons for ripping off your boss.
[Man] You're Puerto Rican, right?
what the fuck is that?
Puerto Rico, how do you spell it?
OK, guys.
guys! - [Bangs on table]
there's a quiz on your desks.
it'll probably take you as long as it takes me to read your homework, so...
let's go.
[Man] How do you spell that?
[Charles] "The mornlng It all began, began llke any other mornlng.
Charles was runnlng late, and as a result, he mlssed hls regular traln.
Champlonshlp fucklng.
twelve rounder.
I need a loan, Charlle.
Charles had made hlm klll.
Charles was to blame.
he was a murder suspect.
luclnda turned out to be thls whole other person.
Charles wlped hls prlnts and ran away llke he was never there, back to hls shltty llttle llfe.
but when he flnlshed readlng the story, he went to the laundry room.
yeah? - I need to use the bathroom.
I'll alert the media.
you lookin' for a daddy?
[Man 2] What the fuck you lookin' at, homey?
[LaRoche] I hope you liked my story. - [Clattering]
you never checked if I made it out of that hotel alive, did you?
[Chuckles] You're so predictable, Oharles.
it takes more than one bullet to kill me.
much more.
but you took something from me, Oharlie, and that ain't right.
it's my money.
fuck the money.
you killed her. - You're insane.
I loved her, Oharlie...
...when you just wanted to fuck her.
what do you want?
I want you, Oharlie.
I'm gonna fuck with your life because I can.
by the way...
...is your daughter still a virgin? - [Grunting]
you don't know how happy I was to see your name on those notebooks.
it's like if you begged me to find you.
man, you ended up in the wrong prison, Oharlie.
Laroche. - Yeah?
I chose this prison.
OK, Mr. Schine. You're free to go.
you take it easy now.
[Ohurch] I met him a few times a while ago.
[Ohurch] Here he comes. All right, thank you.
what did you tell them? - The truth.
I went to use the bathroom, and this guy jumped me with a shank.
well, that guy was the asshole who killed Winston.
he killed two people in Paris, one in New York.
you expect me to believe that you overpowered him?
I guess I got lucky.
you brought that shank in with you, it's premeditated murder.
law don't care who you kill.
I guess the law didn't care much for Winston, either.
Bye. See you guys later.
OK, sweetheart.
whatever you wanna do, I'm in your corner.
Lynette made a promise...
Mr. Faladi...
I love him, and he loves me!
and Bree's daughter fell for her history teacher.
while Mike's history... - He suffered significant memory loss.
was being carefully rewritten.
Susan Mayer. - We were close, huh?
that tramp treated you like dirt.
the art of sabotage. - It's practiced every day in the suburbs.
sometimes it takes the form of a bundt cake offered to a friend who's on a diet.
Yes, in suburbia, everyone you meet is a potential saboteur... Absolutely everyone.
good afternoon. I'm, uh, Bree Hodge, and you are?
name's Gus, and we're all booked up.
actually, Gus, um, I'm here to see one of your guests. - A gentleman named Faladi.
Oh, yeah, came in about an hour ago. You want me to call him for you?
lady, I can't do that.
besides, he has a girl in there.
Yes, I know.
she's my daughter. - My 17-year-old daughter.
uh, that would be, uh, room, uh, 17.
now there's irony for you.
you don't have a gun in there, do you?
because I just put down new carpet.
Oh, Gus, I don't plan anything unpleasant.
I'm simply going to inform Mr. Faladi what repercussions he faces. - What the hell?! - Mom! What are you doing here?!
you just can't walk right in here.
how can you do this to me?! - What makes you think that you can walk in here...
I told you, it's over! But I love you!
okay, didn't you hear her?!
so how'd it go?
quite well, I think.
but few do it as well s Bree Hodge...
Oh, and, Gus, the carpet is beautiful.
or as politely.
family dinner.
there was a time when that phrase meant something on Wisteria Lane.
of course, this was back when meals were lovingly prepared by wives who loved to cook for children who remembered their manners.
but family dinners, like the times, had changed, and attendance was not optional.
I don't know when I've tasted such tender spring lamb.
thank you, dear.
Danielle, you haven't touched your dinner.
she doesn't like spring lamb.
she prefers old goat.
I'm glad you guys think it's so funny that my life is over.
your mother was right to end that relationship.
the man was your teacher and married. - He's getting a divorce.
well, that hardly bolsters his suitability. Danielle, please, eat something.
don't worry, dear.
hunger strikes demand self-control, and as we've seen, that's hardly her strong suit.
when are you gonna take me seriously?
when you start acting like an adult.
well, she sleeps with them. That's a start.
I hate you!
I hate all of you!
remind me to buy paper plates.
we'll need them till a certain someone can be trusted with china again.
wow, you're pretty good at that.
Hey, you are home early.
Yes...I am. What is all this?
we are having a celebration.
sit.
what are we celebrating?
you being the greatest wife in the world.
Thanks.
no, seriously, though.
I mean it.
how many wives would tell their husbands to follow his dreams, and then have the patience to wait while he figures out what the hell it is?
Oh, my god! You know what you wanna do!
that's fantastic! What is it?
wait for it, wait for it...
okay, I knew I needed to spend my days doing something I was passionate about, something creative.
Yeah, have at it. - Um, something where I interacted with the public but I was still my own boss, and then this morning, it just like--bam, it hit me!
okay, okay, I'm dying here.
what's the dream?
you're eating it.
excuse me?
I'm gonna open up a pizza parlor!
I bet you didn't see that one coming.
no, that was a real frisbee to the head, that one.
but - but when you think about it, doesn't it make perfect sense?
I mean, marinara's in my blood.
you remember uncle Vito? He came to this country with nothing.
he turned that trattoria into a gold mine.
isn't he the one that asked us for a loan last Christmas?
he has a gambling problem, but don't ble the pizza.
trust me.
I've got this thing all mapped out.
so what do you think?
I think...
I'm gonna open another bottle of wine.
but we haven't finished this one.
well, hey, we're celebrating, right?
Carlos, what are you doing in my room?
Oh, hey, Gaby, you're home early.
God, Carlos!
strawberries and champagne?
did you really think you're gonna seduce me?
never entered my mind.
Oh, right, right.
you know, I may be living with you until the divorce is final, but it doesn't mean I have to put up with your cheesy come-ons.
Gaby, can I just say one thing?
what, you've been doing some thinking, and you realize that I'm your soul mate, and there's a vacancy in your heart only I can fill?
Gaby, listen. - It's over between us.
just move on already.
forget me.
as I was trying to say, I have company over.
this is Trishelle.
Trishelle, this is...
what was your name again?
I seem to have forgotten.
so the doctor said I should use as many things as I can to jog your memory.
and not just pictures.
he said I could use tastes and smells and sounds, so tonight is sounds of the seventies.
well, you know, let me set the scene.
um, we were at this funky little fish joint that you'd been dying to take me to - Cappy's.
do you remember Cappy's?
okay, well, we were there, and, uh, we were just wolfing down the most delicious trout ever.
how long till the music part? -Oh, it's coming.
um, and - and this '70s cover band, well, they started to play, and...
that's how we got our song.
our song was "car wash"?
see how much fun we were?
so I dragged you out onto the dance floor, and, you were giving me this look - sort of like the look you're giving me right now - and, um,
I started to do this...and then you did this...
I'm - look, I'm sorry, this - this isn't working.
Oh, Mike. Come on, you're not even trying to remember! It was fun!
Oh, I know. Okay, sing with me.
you know, I'm really beat.
okay, Mike, I- I am not doing this to upset you.
I'm doing this to help.
I get that.
it's just...
the music is giving me a headache.
okay, well...
I'll go, but I am not giving up on you.
you know, you are going to remember the night that we danced to "car wash,"
and not just because it was fun, but because later that night, we did some things that, trust me, are worth remembering.
that Jane Doe from the golf course...
I think I missed something at the autopsy.
check it out.
you always gotta come at lunch, don't you?
those blue marks on the back of her hand?
first I thought they were veins.
now I think it's ink.
you mean, like some kind of writing?
I need to run some more tests, see if I can get a clearer image.
I could be wrong, but...
but what?
I think it's a phone number.
the oddest thing happened at the club today.
Andrew, would you be a dear and make sure your sister's just breaking her own things?
Anyway...Tish Atherton...
Yeah, I'll tell 'em.
I'm telling you, it was a deliberate snub.
I waved to her, and she looked right through me.
true, I never bought her eldest daughter a gift. - Uh, mom?
Andrew, please don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.
now what is it, dear?
well, um, Danielle's upstairs trying to commit suicide.
there's no rush. She's not trying that hard.
how can you sit there playing that ridiculous game?!
your sister tried to kill herself. That doesn't upset you?
she tried to slit her wrists with a spoon.
how upset do you want me to be?
Mrs. Hodge?
is my daughter all right?
she's a little groggy, but she'll be fine.
the wounds are fairly superficial.
so's the patient.
we'll release her tonight, but you understand that in cases like this, counseling is mandatory.
of course. We'll get her all the help she needs.
she is resisting our efforts to pump her stomach.
she says she only took three sedatives.
she's disoriented.
pump her.
pump her.
they're sticking a tube down her throat.
do you still think this is funny?
mom, this was a half-assed bid for attention.
this was a cry for help, and if we don't listen, the next time she could do something even more dangerous.
Yeah, next time she might jump off the porch.
stop it!
suicide is the worst thing that can happen to a family!
I will not have it made light of!
Orson's right.
we need to support each other as a family.
in fact, I say we all go for counseling.
Tom actually said he's opening up a pizza parlor?
Lynette, you're not serious.
well, might as well stand in a vat of tomato sauce and tear up $100 bills.
I know, but I said that I would support him and help him follow his dream.
well, he can't hold you to that, not if the dream is pizza.
she promised to stand by him, and once you make that commitment you have to see it through.
how's that divorce going?
I'm done talking.
Hey, Parker, be careful up there.
I just keep thinking he's gonna come to his senses and realize it's a bad idea.
that's never gonna happen.
Why?
because men are genetically incapable of realizing that their dreams are stupid.
care to elaborate, Dr. Mccluskey?
my husband sold insurance for 36 years, and one day, he woke up and decided he wanted to move to Paris and paint naked ladies.
I told him," Gilbert, you can barely paint the garage.
what makes you think you can commit art?"
and for the rest of his life, he despised me.
he despised you for saying "no"?
well, he also thought I was sleeping with his brother, and I'm sure that was mixed in there, too.
okay, so I got Kayla all unpacked.
Oh, great. So, uh, Tom will drop her off at your house on Friday.
sounds good. Lynette, can I talk to you for a second?
okay, pardon me for having really big ears, but I heard about Tom and this pizza place.
do you wanna know what I think?
no, not really.
it sucks.
it's a sucky idea, and your friends back there - they're just too nice to come right out and say it.
luckily, I'm not your friend, so you can trust me.
nip it...in...the bud.
and make Tom resent me for the rest of his life.
I don't think so.
well, you better do somethin', 'cause if you don't, you and me will wind up working a pole to pay for braces.
Hey, Julie.
I bought you some flowers.
generally, when you buy flers, they don't still have the roots on them.
okay, uh, I was hoping you could help me with my English lit paper.
Hi, I'm Sarah.
so what do you say?
actually, m sort of busy right now.
Oh, come on.
look, aunt Edie's gonna give me the boot if I flunk out.
wouldn't you miss me? - Oh, absolutely!
whose motorcycle would wake us all up at 2: 00 in the morning?
you drive a motorcycle?
please? Look, I could really use some help here.
normally, I charge 12 bucks an hour for tutoring, but seeing as it's you...$15.
great. See you Friday.
Hi.
you're new. - Where's Marcy?
she's in Honolulu on vacation.
can I help you? - Oh, I'm just going to see Mike Delfino.
what's that smell?
uh, that's my maconi and cheese.
I-I was hoping it would trigger Mike's memory.
I made it the first time we met two years ago.
you should've refrigerated it.
Oh, you know Ms. Britt?
uh, yeah.
what is she doing here?
visiting Mr. Delfino.
you know, she was with him when he came out of his coma.
What?!
and she's been here every day since.
you!
Hello, Susan.
long time no see.
I've been wondering why Mike's been so cold to me. Now it all makes sense.
I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about.
for god sakes, take a bath.
Oh, that's my mac and cheese. Don't change the subject.
what have you been telling him about me?
why would I say anything about you?
Mike has no idea who you are.
I envy him.
ladies, is there a problem?
I want this woman banned from the hospital.
she's been like this ever since Mike dumped her.
imagine "fatal attraction..."with a much older woman.
ma'am, Mr. Delfino already has a visitor.
I think you should go.
me?
but why doesn't she leave?
I - I'm the one who's been here every day for the last six months.
well, I don't know you, but I do know his girlfriend.
girlfriend?! Okay, you know what?
I want Marcy's number in Honolulu, and I want it right now.
you need to leave. - What?!
you're disturbing the other patients.
no, what are you - Oh, this is ridiculous!
I mean, who am I disturbing? It's a coma ward! Don't you want them to wake up?!
did not call you that!
Yes, you did!
I have never in my life used the word "retard."
it's what you think.
you think I'm the immature moron who can't be trusted to decide what's best for her.
well, you did try to off yourself.
I don't think you get to pull the "I know what's best for me" card.
Andrew! Not in front of the therapist.
actually, I think we're making great progress.
you feel Danielle refuses to see you're acting in her best interest.
and you think your mother cares more about her image than your feelings.
Danielle, how can you think I don't care about your feelings?
don't you know how much your mother loves you?
when I saw you in that tub, it was the worst moment of my life.
the thought of losing you is more than I can bear.
how does that make you feel?
Actually...kind of powerful.
powerful?
you really don't wanna lose me?
of course not.
I already went through thinking I'd lost Andrew.
I can't go through that again.
well, then, here's what's going to happen.
I'm going to start dating Robert again, and if you try to break us up or get him fired, then I'm going to leave, and you will never see me again.
Danielle. - If that can survive on its own, so can I.
you don't believe me? Call my bluff. See what happens.
so what do we owe you for all this progress?
come on, Austin. Concentrate.
okay, why did Iago betray Othello?
what do you think you're doing?
sorry.
no, no, no, no! No, no, we're here to work.
and if my mom came home, she'd flip. Now put that away.
you said,"put it away."
look, if - if you think I'm gonna sit here and write your paper for you while you're getting drunk...
no, just help me get it started, okay? This is hard for me, all right?
I didn't read a lot of Shakespeare in juvie.
I kind of majored in not getting stabbed.
Ugh, fine.
I'll write your intro, but - but then you're on your own.
thank you very much.
so...
why did they send you to juvie anyway?
"they" didn't.
my mom did.
Why?
she had this boyfriend - no job, big drunk, real catch.
one night, he pops her one, so I break a chair over his head, and, uh...
and she calls the cops...on me.
but you were protecting her.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
but the guy said he'd leave if she didn't press charges, and, well, my mom doesn't really like to be alone.
you know what?
you're tired.
um, why don't you lay down for a couple minutes, and I'll just do a page or two?
you're a rock star, Mayer.
no Trishelle tonight?
Ah, no.
about her - I have a confession to make.
does her pimp want the rest of the money?
you know, there is some cash in my purse.
look, I know I crossed a line bringing her here, all right?
but I was trying to make you jealous, like the way you made me feel when you said you slept with John Rowland again.
well, I think it's more than that. I think you really hate me.
that's not true.
Oh, I think it is.
you know, introducing your spouse to someone you're about to have sex with?
there's only one reason to do that - pure hatred.
you don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, I think I do.
Phil, come meet my basically ex-husband. - Thank you. - Carlos.
Carlos, this is my new friend Phil Lopez.
we've met, Gaby.
Really?
well, that's weird.
Fairview chamber of commerce - the annual dinner.
Oh, my god! That's right! That's right!
you were up for the Latino businessman of the year award that Phil won.
well, actually, I beat him out twice.
No!
Ooh, I remember.
Carlos was so annoyed.
what did you say, hon?
he may have that trophy, but I've got you.
ain't life funny?
Gaby, can we talk for a sec?
mnh-mnh, not right now.
Phil and I are getting in the hot tub.
Ooh, Phil, did you bring your suit?
you said I didn't have to.
not in front of Carlos-say!
go outside. I'll meet you there.
you brought home Phil Lopez?!
I had no idea you hated me that much!
well, now you know.
Hey, good news.
my realtor found me some sweet locations.
That's...great.
Hey, can we talk about this restaurant thing for a second?
what's up?
I don't know if you noticed, but when you first pitched the whole pizza concept...
I was a wee bit skeptical.
Yeah, I sensed that.
of course you did, 'cause you're a smart guy, which is also why you are gonna jump on the idea I have to make the whole thing work.
okay, so you're not bailing on me?
no, no, no, I am totally on board.
Oh, good! You had me scared there for a second.
okay, so, well, what is this great idea?
I'm thinking...catering company.
start small, have an Italian theme, create some cash flow, and then later on, expand into the pizza thing.
but that's not my dream.
well, think about it.
you're gonna do all these fun parties.
people will start talking - "Hey, this is great food.
this guy should open a restaurant.
Yeah, yeah, I'd eat there," and then wham!
five short years later, you have a built-in customer base.
but I said it's not my dream.
pizza is my dream.
know, I know. Catering's how you get there.
so why can't I just skip the catering, and go straight to the pizza?
because you'll fail!
I'm sorry! God.
I shouldn't have said that.
but you're gambling with our life savings, and you have no experience.
I'm trying to. I am trying to.
but are you aware that 90% of restaurants tank in their first year?
which means that 10% of them make it!
why don't you ever think that I would be one of them?
No! No, do me a favor. Don't answer that.
I'm making a snack for Phil.
do you want something to eat?
some sour grapes, perhaps?
maybe a little crow?
okay, we need to move this over there.
Why?
uh, feng shui.
Oh, no, no, don't just stand there. Help me!
Hey, don't start without me.
Oh, no, no, let's get something straight. - You and I are not gonna have sex tonight.
what?
I'm sorry. No offense, you're a nice guy. I'm just not into you that way.
Oh, god, Phil!
Yes, yes, give it to me!
okay. Oh, okay.
no, no, I'm not talking to you. Back off!
what - but I thought - I mean...
you know, the hot tub...we were...
Yes, you saw my boobs, and you're gonna have that mental snapshot to use as you wish for the rest of your life...
but that is all you're getting!
wait, wait, so you're just using me?
you're unbelievable.
I'm what?!
you are unbelievable!
Really?
Oh, so are you, big boy!
no wonder you're divorcing her. She's a straight-up loon.
Oh, crap. She's blocking my car!
always happy to help a brother out.
hold on.
Oh, god, yes!
Oh, ride 'em, cowboy!
Oh, yes, god!
take me home, Philly!
you should wear a saddle!
stop it, Phil. I told you to beat it. No means no!
I need your car keys.
you're blocking the stallion's hatchback.
Oh, yes, yes, Phil!
fill me with Phil!
I never said that.
and you moved the bed.
what were you thinking? - Shut up.
you know, if you were trying to hurt me, that's not the way to do it.
well, then enlighten me.
how can I hit you so hard that you will never recover?
you can't.
Oh, I have to, Carlos.
I need you to give up on us.
we're not good for each other, and I can't keep doing this.
but I can.
you proved something tonight. - You had a rich, good-looking guy in your bed, and you couldn't pull the trigger.
that means you still care, and as long as I know that, I can take anything that you can dish out.
you know what? I'm tired. Can we talk about this in the morning?
sure.
but you're bringing me breakfast in bed or no deal.
it's a date.
what are you - Oh!
Oh, Julie!
thank god it's you.
we totally thought you were the cops.
Oh, hey, Julie.
what are you, on buzz kill patrol tonight?
this is why you couldn't go to the movies with me?
well, sorry, I thought you weren't that into him.
but, you know, if you are - I'm not!
I'm just - I'm mad that you blew me off.
well, I would totally understand if you wanted to blow me off for a date.
you call this a date. - Getting mauled in a car?
Hey, you wanna talk about this later?
I'm losing altitude here.
Ugh, you are disgusting!
enjoy the rest of your date.
Julie, there you are.
I think I found a way to get through to Mike.
let it go! He's not into you!
Gaby, rise and shine.
I made you some waffles.
I got a second wind last night, so I went to a bar.
that's where I met Jason.
we spent the whole night. - How did you put it?
pulling the trigger.
so did I hurt you, or should I keep trying?
you kicked ass in rehab today.
Yeah, I raised my arm over my head. Sign me up for the Olympics.
Oh, be patient. It takes time.
ms. Britt?
phone call for you at the nurses' station.
for me?
I'll be right back.
there's a phone call for me?
what are you... - Shh!
I thought you could use some fresh air.
Hello? It's Edie.
what the hell is this? Who's he?
Oh, this is Hank, and he has very kindly offered to take us on a little field trip today...
for 60 bucks an hour.
where are you taking me?
uh, just a little jaunt down memory lane.
Oh, god, you're not taking me to that fish and disco place, are you?
no, no.
what we're doing today is a little more low-key.
don't worry. You're totally safe.
we're not doing anything wrong.
punch it!
hello.
look, Mrs. Hodge, uh, I've only seen your daughter once since the motel.
she told me that you backed off.
Oh, Mr. Faladi, I'm not here to threaten you.
I've come to give you my blessing.
your blessing?
Yes, Danielle made it quite clear that I'm powerless to stop this relationship, and since she assures me that you love her - you do love her, don't you?
uh, yes, of course.
good. Then we're all set.
here are some of her clothes.
I'll bring her CDs and her stuffed animals over tomorrow.
you want her to stay here?
this place is kind of small.
well, that hotel room was small, and you seemed happy enough tre.
Oh, and I trust you to be discreet.
you wouldn't want your wife find out about this and use it against you in your divorce.
whoa, whoa, Mrs. Hodge?
things are getting a little bit complicated.
could you please tell Danielle that this is not gonna work out and that we...
Mr. Faladi, if you want to break my daughter's heart, I can't stop you, but I will not be an accomplice.
you'll tell her yourself.
right.
and don't even think about blaming me, 'cause if you so much as mention that we spoke, I'll phone the police.
fine, I will leave you out of it.
Oh, and one more thing...
yes?
Danielle is applying to colleges.
I do hope she can count on you for a glowing recommendation.
sure.
and when I locked myself out of the house, that's where the bush was that you found me in...naked.
surely you remember that.
Nope.
Ouch, that hurts.
um, okay, remember this spot?
this is where we sat in your truck and had our first kiss.
were you naked then, too?
Mike, why are you being this way?
because this is pointless.
I...I'm sorry. I can't - I don't remember being with you.
okay, I know it's hard, but you gotta make an effort, and, you know, if your head is a little foggy, then don't look there.
look in your heart, because I'm in there, just like you're inside mine.
okay, um, this is Mary Ace's house, and this is where we first met.
I was setting out my macaroni and cheese, and you were invited - Oh! Ow!
finally, a smile.
you do that a lot, don't you?
well, yeah, I've been known to take a spill or two, but, you know, my doctor says it's an inner ear...
wait, you remember that?
Yeah, I think I...do.
Yes!
that's progress!
see? Oh, it's all gonna come back.
we're gonna be us again!
but... What about the British guy?
I don't know what Edie's been telling you, but Ian and I - we're just friends.
just friends?
Yeah...now.
look, you gotta understand.
the doctors were telling me that you would probably never wake up, and I just needed somebody to talk to.
and that's what you were doing in the country - talking?
Mr. Delfino?
are you okay?
I'm fine.
you can't just discharge a patient without permission!
Oh, but you - I was just trying to help him remember.
tell her, Mike. We were - we were making progress.
take me back to the hospital.
Oh, uh... Mike!
well, at the risk of stating the obvious, it's over.
he's mine now.
no, no, no, no!
no, no, this - this is not how this ends.
no, evil does not triumph over good.
that's how you see me?
damn straight!
you lie, you cheat, you scheme!
you ruin people's relationships!
soon with Mike on top of me, if you know what I mean.
see? Evil! Evil!
has it ever occurred to you that mbe Mike and I are meant to end up together?
No!
you - you - Mike?
you don't even want him!
you're just doing this to hurt me.
how self-absorbed can you be?
I have had a thing for Mike since the day he moved in here, and I even backed off when he fell for your little miss adorable act.
but he's over that.
it's my turn now, and I will be better for him than you ever were.
and if you do get hurt, well...that's just gravy.
all right, maybe that was a little evil. Finally.
finally. Sorry it took so long.
that last digit was barely legible.
I thought you'd like to do the honors.
you've reached Mike Delfino plumbing.
please leave a message after the beep.
whoa, a D-minus.
that blows.
Yeah, it does, especially since it's not the one we did together.
you e-mailed me the wrong paper.
you didn't even read it before you turned it in?
I didn't think I had to!
the one you wrote that night was great.
well, after you left, I decided I really should put it in your words.
is this some weird chick thing you did 'cause you're into me?
Oh, please.
no, no.
no, it is.
you're, uh, pissed 'cause I hooked up with your friend.
no, I'm pissed because you told me some sob story so I'd write your paper for u.
now you owe me 15 bucks.
you know what?
here.
Oh, and, uh, I did learn something.
Iago betrayed Othello because he was jealous.
Oh, Danielle, I thought you'd be with Mr. Faladi tonight.
Oh, you'll be happy to know he dumped me.
he dumped you?
said it was getting too messy, that I was gonna complicate his divorce.
don't pretend you're sorry.
I don't plan to.
well, I hope this doesn't make history class too awkward.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
thanks to me, he'll be getting nothing in this divorce.
well, I must say that was rather underhanded.
Yes.
I wonder where she gets it.
Bye, daddy. - Bye, Hipmunk.
I'll see you guys next Friday, okay?
Kayla said that you're opening a pizza place.
well, maybe. I mean, it's not a done deal yet.
Lynette put the kibosh on it, huh?
what makes you say that?
well, you know...
well, she's probably right.
I mean, there's a bunch of dumb hmucks out there trying to open a restaurant, so...
it was like I died and went to Italy.
Really?
Oh, my god.
you are born to do this, and I just hate to see you give it up, because, well...
man, this is none of my business, but Lynette does bully you sometimes.
well, she doesn't mean to.
then don't let her! You go to the mat on this one.
she will respect you a lot more if you grow a pair.
I'm not trying to insult you.
all I'm saying is that...
I know what you're capable of, and I believe in you.
I really needed to hear that.
Thanks.
sabotage - everyone is capable of it, but some go about it more ruthlessly than others...
like the ones who crave vengeance...
or the ones who hunger for love...
or the ones who are determined to burn bridges.
and then there are those who simply want something...
I wish daddy lived here so he could tuck me in, too.
something that belongs to someone else.
I'm working on it, piglet.
mama's working on it.
just called, and Juanita got accepted to Oakridge.
there was acceptance...
I like the blunt Ana more than the cute Ana.
so you think I'm cute?
a plea...
you have to let me help you, or I am...
or you won't get into heaven?
a breakdown...
did you stab yourself?
I have to get to mike!
No!
and a confrontation.
I don't know how you feel, Lynette, because you never talk about it!
we lost a kid.
how can saying this out loud be helpful?
if you want to throw a successful dinner party, there are certain rules that must be followed.
if the good silver is used, it must be polished.
if music is played, the volume should be low.
if the guests bring wine, it must be served.
and if the evening is to be truly successful...there must be a toast.
to Lee. This dinner has been a total triumph.
Oh, Bob! - And it's not over yet.
I made a fruit tart for dessert.
and in case any of you are diabetic, let me just say...it was nice knowing you.
no. Seriously, this is how we lost his cousin.
Hey, Bob, where's the whipped cream?
Oh. I totally forgot.
I was on my phone and I drove right past the store.
of course, because it's something that i needed.
I was working all day.
if it was that important, why didn't you just go out and get it?
uh, i work, too. Selling houses is work.
house.
he's sold one house in six months.
attacking.
what-- what's that?
my feelings journal.
lee and I are seeing this counselor.
she has us write down our negative feelings to discuss in our sessions.
seems like you got a lot of feelings there, Lee.
that's volume three, with an entire chapter about me forgetting to put down the toilet seat.
I thought that would be the one advantage with two guys living together.
you'd think.
well, the good news is that you're -- you're getting help.
you know, we should think about seeing someone.
what? - You know, to help us with our stuff.
can we talk about our stuff later?
we could, but you won't.
she-- she never wants to talk.
you know how i feel about therapy.
it's for weak, indulgent...straight people.
you guys totally make it work.
I used to feel the same way about therapy.
but this lady -- she's really great.
volume three?
can't we give it a try?
I don't need someone telling me how I feel, okay?
so could we just drop it?
and the number one rule for a successful dinner party?
after dessert, let's karaoke!
keep discussion of your marriage to an absolute minimum.
Dr. Brent Avedon was the head of psychology at the Fairview Health Center.
he spent his days treating antisocial adolescents, delusional dowagers...and bipolar businessmen.
but lately, his most interesting patient was a housewife who'd had a nervous breakdown.
I was just so lonely.
and then one day, along came this wonderful man,
a man who made me laugh, who gave me hope again...
and who turned out to be in love with someone else.
so I went back to being lonely.
only it was worse now because...he wasn't really gone.
he was across the street, holding her hand, laughing with her.
so one day...
I pretended, just for a second...that it wasn't her hand he was holding.
it was mine.
and that's how the fantasies started?
when i was hurting, i would let myself imagine that he was there with me.
but then those moments started to...M-mean more to me than what was real.
so...I just let myself have them.
I let them take over.
what about now? Do you feel that the edication is helping you?
well, I certainly have a firmer grasp on reality now.
I can see things, for the first time in a long while, very clearly.
that's great.
no. Not really.
because now I can see what I've done to my life.
And...how I've ruined it.
okay, Orson, it's time for me to give you your bath.
not now.
Orson, you haven't bathed in over a week.
now i don't want to do this any more than you do, but frankly, you're getting a little ripe.
I said I don't want a bath.
well, it's not about what you want anymore.
it's a matter of preserving the drapes.
to have another human being bathe me is humiliating.
here. - What's this?
a list of things I need at the store.
I just went to the store for you an hour ago. Can't it wait?
no. I need these items immediately. It's urgent.
Orson, how are cornnuts urgent?
I'm sorry, Bree.
I just thought that since you played a major part in putting me in this chair, you'd want to play a small part in making my new life tolerable.
give me the list.
better yet, leave it on the table and then back away.
Hey, teacher. - Hi!
I just dropped off Juanita for her first day. She's a little nervous.
Aw, she's gonna love it here. The teachers are great.
so what animal is she? - Excuse me?
Oh, they test the kids and they place them in groups according to their level.
in math, there's leopards, chipmunks, giraffes.
it should be in her folder.
Oh, she's a leopard.
what's M.J?
he's a giraffe.
so... Which is the advanced group?
no one knows. They won't even tell me.
principal Hobson feels that if the parents find out, they'll freak and get all competitive.
that's crazy. Who cares?
exactly.
leopards are the morons, aren't they?
no. I-I didn't say that.
Yeah, you did. When I asked about M. J.you were like,"he's a giraffe!"
and then I said Juanita was a leopard, and you were like,"oh."
you're just jumping to conclusions.
you know something. Spill it!
okay. Uh, I don't know for sure, but I teach these kids, and it's pretty obvious.
this... is Rachel Miller.
damn, that's good.
huh. She's a giraffe.
and this is Wendy Benson.
okay. - Chipmunk.
and this one was made by Adam Hunter -- a leopard.
my god, it looks like an actual leopard made it.
there's nothing wrong with being a leopard.
they're very important here.
they... Move the cafeteria tables, excellent door holders.
this isn't fair.
Gaby, w-we have a saying around here.
it's the pace, not the race.
I know my daughter. She is all giraffe.
I'm gonna go talk to the principal.
um... Y-y-you don't push. You...
sorry. My daughter wasn't here to hold it for me.
jeez, Lyne - dinner's ready. Go wash up.
what is that?
it's nothing. It's, uh-- it's, uh... It's personal.
personal? - Yes.
and I think it's important this morning, you walked in and sat on the toilet while I shaved my legs.
we have no boundaries.
attacking.
what? You sound just like bob and...
Oh! Oh! Oh, my god! Is that a feelings journal?
if you must know, yes, it is.
I started seeing their therapist.
why didn't you tell me?
because I wanted to talk to someone, and I didn't need your ridicule.
are you talking about the baby?
it started out about that. But now we're on to, um... other things.
other things? You mean like me?
I might've mentioned you once or twice.
once or twice? Uh-huh.
I bet if we downed a shot every time we read the name "Lynette," we'd be hammered by page two.
let me see that. - Oh, no, no. No way.
but if you're really interested in what's in here, you can always join me in therapy.
like hell.
fine.
then I guess you'll just have to wait for the movie.
here we go.
thanks again for having me. This all looks delicious.
Oh, it's your first night over. I wanted to make you a traditional Italian meal.
rigatoni with sausage, chicken parm.
just salad would be great.
Oh, screw the salad. That came out of a bag.
this rigatoni came from my heart.
to be honest, I don't eat carbs.
Oh, but you'll make an exception tonight 'cause I've been sweatin' over the stove all day.
ma, let it go. She's watching her weight.
her weight? If i put the air conditioner on high, it'll blow her across the room.
I just have to be careful.
as soon as a graduate high school, I'm going to New York to be a model.
Oh. No college?
are you kidding? And miss my prime modeling years?
what? I think it's great.
it takes guts to follow a dream.
Yeah, it's great, but it'd be nice to have something other than the porn industry to fall back on.
ma.
what? I'm not saying that's gonna happen.
but, you know, a lot of models do end up that way.
I know it's risky, but I'm really passionate about this.
and i think that the best way to be successful in life is to do what you're passionate about.
that's why I keep telling Danny to pursue his poetry.
poetry?
Yeah. It's amazing, right?
I wouldn't know.
I'm too busy cooking food nobody's gonna eat.
Danny, why didn't you ever show me your poetry?
it's no big deal. - Danny, it's great.
I keep telling him he should come to New York with me so he can really focus on his writing.
Wow. A model and a poet.
so while you're doin' porn, he can make the dialogue rhyme.
this is why I don't tell her stuff.
okay. I'm sorry. I was just trying to make a joke.
let's get back to dinner, huh?
Oh, no. I'm good.
carbs. Mnh-mnh.
Oh, I'll be out running errands today, so you'll have to let the physical therapist in when she arrives.
what's wrong?
there's no strawberries.
you know i like strawberries with my waffles.
I am sorry. They're right here.
there you go. Strawberries. Enjoy.
I need whipped cream.
unless you think the strawberries are gonna magically stick to the waffles by themselves.
not so fast.
say "please." - I will not. Now give me my breakfast.
Orson, I am happy to do whatever you ask, but i will not treated like a slave.
now say "please.
now that I look at your waffle, I understand why you're so eager to have it.
you know the magic word. It has six letters.
I know a word that has three.
if you don't give me my food, i'm gonna she that fork up it.
you can have it when you're ready to be polite.
Mr. Hobson, my daughter is incredibly bright.
I just need to know if she's in the advanced classes.
you know that we have a policy not to disclose that.
Oh, you don't have to say anything.
just blink when I mention the smart group. Leopard.
Mrs. Solis -- Wait, was that a blink or a twitch?
I can't tell. You seem very nervous.
you see, this is exactly why we don't tell the parents.
they start behaving irrationally.
and stop trying to read things on my desk upside-down.
what is the big deal? I just need to know if my daughter's gonna succeed in life.
she's 7.
now i suggest that you stop prying and just be proud of her no matter what group she's in.
I am proud of her, and i don't pry.
by the way, enjoy your colonoscopy on the 16th.
mom. What are you doing here?
I was just having a nice get-to-know-you chat with the principal.
who are your friends?
um, this is Wendy and Rachel. We're in math together.
wait a minute. I think I saw your art projects.
Wendy, you're a chipmunk, right?
and, Rachel, you're a raffe?
Oh, okay.
you know what I would love to do?
is take a picture with Juanita and her friends.
and, uh, you know what would be really cute?
is if you hold up your math homework.
got it.
but i wasn't smiling.
yeah? Well, it's a tough world out there. Not much to smile about.
have a great day!
your mom's weird.
you have no idea.
Orson? I'm letting myself in.
time for your therapy.
help me!
Oh! Help.
Oh! Dear lord! Orson! What happened?
Oh! Joyce. Oh!
well, I was trying to get those waffles, and I fell out of my chair.
w-w-what are they doing up there?
starving him? That's ridiculous.
Really? So you don't torment him by putting food out of his reach?
Oh. Well, you kinda had to be there for that.
can someone please get me a piece of bread?
Orson, for god sakes! Stop that!
please hit me in the legs this time.
there's no feeling there.
Mrs. Hodge, may I speak to you privately for a moment?
you-- you have to believe me. I would never hit my husband.
I sensed him being a little dram. But withholding food?
the whole thing started because he refused to say please...
which i know sounds rather petty, but you have to understand.
he has been impossible lately.
the man is facing life in a wheelchair.
he's mad at the world, and unfortunately, he's taking it out on you.
look...
I know this is not easy.
but until he comes to accept this, you're gonna have to figure out how to be more patient.
and if you can't, it's my obligation to report it.
Oh, and give the man a bath.
physical therapy shouldn't require gloves.
you weren't home when they tried to deliver this, so I signed for it.
Yeah, we just-- we had, uh, we saw an ad for...
honest to God, don't need to know.
good. Um... Ah, look.
looks like somebody got a new girlfriend.
Yeah, not for long. I do not approve.
Ah. You don't approve, and she's got a body that would make the pope walk through a sliding glass door.
gosh, who's gonna win?
he is my kid. If I don't think she is good for him, I will do whatever I have to do.
which will drive him towards her and away from you.
look, I know what it's like when a mom hates the hottie her son loves.
Bob's mom hated me. Ugh.
huh. I always thought that Bob was...
the point is, she overplayed her hand and made bob choose between us.
and the long story short, I'm cuddling up with Bob every night.
and where's mama? Nursing home.
how'd she get there? Don't know. Can't remember.
it's just... I don't know this girl.
and I-I-I don't know if I can trust her.
well, then you better get to know her.
I'd hate to see you lose your son because you're afraid to share him.
get outta here.
Carlos, did you get the pictures I sent you?
you're as beautiful as the day we met.
time hasn't touched you at all.
not of me-- of the math homework.
what?
here.
this assignment looks easy, doesn't it?
pretty basic, yeah.
and look at this one with the multiplication.
little more complicated, right?
I guess.
and this one...
word problems. Fractions.
this is the hardest one, isn't it?
looks like it. So?
Carlos, this is the leopard's homework.
well, that cleared that up.
no. Don't you get it? Our daughter is a leopard.
Hey! Good for her.
Oh, poor Susan.
yeah? Why?
well, she was convinced that M.J.'s brilliant, and it turns out he's in the slow group.
I'd hate for her to find out.
Gaby, you are not telling her.
why not? She didn't have any trouble telling me she thought Juanita was one thermos short of a lunch box.
she said that? - Yes. With her tone.
well, we've had enough drama with the neighbors lately, so just drop it.
fine, I'll drop it.
but just to let you know, I like you better when you're reading the newspaper, pretending to listen.
sure, take whatever you need.
what are you doing here?
I told them I don't want any visitors.
who says I'm visiting? Maybe I'm bonkers, too.
gonna eat the applesauce?
remember when my gout flared up and I couldn't walk?
and you used to come over to see me?
I figured I owe ya.
debt paid. Good-bye.
I see you got your charming personality back.
so...
when are you gonna be coming back home?
what makes you think I would ever come back?
after what I did to those people?
no. They hate me.
take it from the reigning odd duck on the lane
nobody cares about all that silly stuff.
Oh, you're right.
Bree and I can just laugh, laugh, laugh about silly me nearly destroying her business.
and I'll tell Susan that I was just joshing about trying to wreck her marriage.
Yeah. Okay. Okay. - Oh, and I'll bet Mike is still chuckling about me getting him thrown in jail.
will you listen?
Kathy, I'm serious.
I'm willing to bet there's more forgiveness there than you imagine.
in that case, you know what?
what?
maybe you are bonkers.
Hey, hon. Look who's here.
Hey, Susan. What's up?
I was going through some of M. J.'s stuff, and I found these ma workbooks from last year.
I thought Juanita would find them helpful.
well...
thank you.
no problem. I thought it might help her catch up.
catch up?
Yeah. You know, from when she was out of school.
she was never out of school.
I was homeschooling her.
and I know you did the best you could.
but now she has professional teachers, and I bet she's gonna catch up to M.J. in no time.
get her.
well, Susan... Ahem. By the way, did you hear?
leopards are the advanced students.
what? - Yeah. It's true.
chipmunks are average. And giraffes, well, those cafeteria tables aren't gonna move themselves.
how do you know this?
I got a copy of each group's homework. Trust me. I cracked the code.
so that means that m. j.'s not in the...
Hey, but you said it yourself-- it's no big deal.
it's the pace, not the race," right?
right.
Oh, and please, don't say anything to anyone.
you know how competitive some parents can get.
huh. Yeah. All too well.
I'm finished. Can I have my milk and cookies now?
sure, sweetie.
you have some pasta stuck to the right side of your face.
no, sweetie. Your right.
Oh, never mind.
Hey, guys.
Mike, can you help me take out the trash?
sure.
never mind that.
Huckles? Okay, so he's a giraffe.
you know, there's nothing wrong with being average.
no, chipmunks are average.
how many times do I have to tell you?
leopards, chipmunks, giraffes.
I love him so much, Mike.
what if he's...slow?
he's not slow.
he's a smart, inquisitive, bright little boy.
Oh, no.
he's got h hand stuck in the glass.
Oh, come on, buddy. Come on. Just-- just hold the glass.
pull with the other hand.
you can do it.
come on, M.J.
Yes! Oh! Yes!
see? You were worried about nothing.
you're right. Oh.
Oh, no. He's heading toward the toaster with a fork!
honey? - Yeah?
I'm heading out. - Okay.
wanna grab lunch today?
uh, maybe tomorrow. I have a-a thing.
if you mean therapy, why not just say "therapy"?
I just didn't want to get into a fight. That's all.
Hey. Won't you need this?
Ah. Right. Thanks.
don't you wanna know if I read it?
Oh. I'd know if you read it.
excuse me. Are you waiting for Dr. Graham?
don't tell me she double-booked again.
Oh, no. I don't have an appointment.
but I really need to talk to her, so can I have yours?
I don't know. I really need to talk to her, too.
Seriously? Because I was looking at you thinking, what is he doing here?
that guy's really got it together.
Thanks. But I'm been having a pretty hard time lately.
I'll give you 200 bucks.
cash? - 20s okay?
so, um...
what were you going to talk to her about?
I'm starting to feel the urge to gamble again.
Thanks.
Mr. Jameson?
he had to go, but he said I could have his appointment.
uh... I'm sorry, but it doesn't work like that.
if you're interested in becoming a patient...
I'm not. I am Mrs. Tom Scavo.
Yep, that's what I thought.
well, I don't blame you for reacting like that.
I can only imagine the stories Tom's been reading to you from his big book of wah!
so... Here I am, Tom Scavo's bitch of a wife, in the flesh.
why do you put it like that?
I don't know specifically what word he uses.
I'm just picking the one that seems the most likely.
so you think your husband describes you as a bitch?
doesn't he?
what tom says in this room is private.
which means yes?
well, obviously, it does to you.
I'm just wondering why that might be.
Oh, I see what you're trying to do, but I did not come here for therapy.
I came here to defend myself.
because there's two sides to every story.
so you're not a bitch?
not all the time, no.
but sometimes?
I just... need...want to feel like I'm in control, and when I don't, that makes me mad.
And...maybe I'm mad a lot because, I don't know if you've noticed, but you can't control what happens in life.
like your baby dying?
I'm going to sit down, but only...
because I'm tired.
unless you need to go or something.
no. I don't need to go anywhere.
how was your day?
is that a... - Yep. Looks like we'll be going to therapy together.
Really? That is great news. Thank you.
W-where's dinner?
I mean, you were home all day.
what are you writing?
you'll find out, Tuesday at 12: 30.
Colleen! Can I talk to you?
uh, I've got parent-teacher conferences, but not for a few minutes. What's up?
it's about M.J. How is he doing in your math class?
Oh, he's such a joy.
Oh, god. You just did the "he's such a joy" with the head tilt.
I give that one to parents all the time when I think their kid is driftwood.
no, seriously, M.J.'s doing great.
Oh, really? Well, if he's doing so great...why is he a giraffe?
what? - He should be a leopard. They're the advanced students.
you don't know that.
I do now. Gaby Solis broke the code.
what? - That's right.
giraffes are the slow learners, and you know it.
giraffes are the slow learners?
no, no, no, Mrs. Chapman. No one said that.
why don't you wait for me in my classroom?
Gabrielle Solis figured out the code,
leopards, chipmunks, giraffes.
Jenny, we got the code!
leopards are the smart ones!
now look at what you've done.
M. J. is here. He's a leopard. Get used to it.
where have you been? I needed to close the door.
Oh, uh, well, I thought a little fresh air would be nice.
hmm, it isn't.
well, as the person who has to share a house with the person who won't take a bath, I need the fresh air.
I don't care. Close it.
I know that you are angry at the world right now.
what happened to you is unimaginable, and I am gonna do whatever I can to help you through this.
and all I ask in return is that you treat me with a little bit of courtesy, and that includes using the word "please."
why the sudden interest in etiquette, Bree?
I mean, I don't recall you saying "please" before you cheated on me.
this conversation is over. The door stays open.
I want it closed. - No. You stink.
and you're a whore! Here's the difference-- I can get clean.
Yes, you can.
what are you doing?
what is going on? I'm not even dressed.
what is that? What-- what is that? What's going on?
Bree, stop.
you wouldn't.
okay, Bree, stop it. Stop. Bree.
if only there was a word you could use to get me to stop, like "please."
I'm calling Joyce. - Say "please.
go to hell!
why can't you just say it? It's easy.
please. Please. Please.
please stop! - Please, please!
please stop it! Please stop!
please roll me over. Please help me off the toilet.
please, please, please!
that's the life I'm facing now, having to ask people for help for everything.
do you know how hard that is?!
every morning I wake up at 5: 00. You get up at 6: 30.
for an hour and a half, I lie there, staring at the bedroom door, fantasizing about how lovely it would be,
how excruciatingly lovely it would be
to get up and make myself a cup of tea one last time.
no "please. " Just hot water and tea.
I'm so sorry.
forgive me.
please.
what are you in for?
eating paste.
what animal group are you?
giraffe.
damn.
I'll be with you two in a moment.
sorry for getting you in trouble.
it's my own fault.
I got carried away.
me, too.
it was just so important to me that Juanita was doing well.
I know.
no, I don't think you do.
my kids are my calling card.
they're what I have to show for myself.
I don't have a career, Susan. My kids are my job.
and whatever happens-- if they succeed or they don't succeed, it's because of how i raise them.
well, at least you get to raise them.
ever since I took this job, I feel like I'm never with M.J.
I constantly worry. Am I there enough for him? Am I letting him down?
you don't have anything to worry about.
M. J.'s a fantastic kid.
well, so is Juanita.
this has been so ridiculous.
leopards and giraffes and chipmunks
I mean, who created this crazy system?
you know, reading class is just as bad.
there's otters, penguins and seals.
Yeah, Juanita's an otter.
I mean, what does an otter have to do with learning how to read?
Juanita's an otter?
Yeah.
Why? What's M.J?
penguin.
Oh. This is pretty. What do you think?
I think maybe I'd buy it for my grandma...
if I hated her.
you're so funny.
so... As much fun as we're having here, why are we doing this?
we are getting to know each other.
Oh. You know me, and you don't like me.
it's not that I don't like you.
it's just, i don't think you're good for Danny.
Why? Because I wouldn't eat your pasta?
rigatoni.
and no.
it's because you are a good-time girl out to have fun.
not that I blame you for it.
you're young. You're beautiful. You're supposed to have fun.
but Danny has been through a lot, and he needs someone who is not gonna hurt him.
I know Danny has been through rough stuff.
when he lashes out and gets all defensive, trying to protect himself?
I get it, because I used to do it, too.
yeah?
it's the thing that made me like him.
I know how he feels, and it's not fun at all.
I don't care if you like me and I don't care if you hate how I dress, but I am not gonna hurt Danny.
how can I be sure of that?
you can't.
but it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm not going anywhere.
what are you doing back here?
I've been thinking about what you said last time.
the more I thought about it, the more it pissed me off.
why is that?
the people on that street have been your friends for years.
I appreciate you coming here. I do.
but after everything I did, I don't see how anyone could forgive me.
well we're not saying it'll be easy.
but we'll give it a try.
I told them how much better you were doing, but they couldn't take my word for it, so they had to see for themselves.
in our darkest moments, we all need someone who will listen.
some turn to friendly professionals.
a few rely on those who are older and wiser.
others seek out someone who knows what they're going through.
but for most of us, nothing is quite so therapeutic as a good long talk with a few old friends.
Gaby learned a secret.
lee and I are trying to adopt a baby.
Mike made a commitment. - I can be a guy who takes care of his family.
Lynette was warned.
I told Preston I want to move up wedding to next week. - Next week?
a killer put everyone on edge.
I can't believe she's dead. - I gotta go home.
my mom's so freaked out this could have been me.
she wants me around. - So you're my brother?
half-brother, to be precise. - Suspicion was born.
what do we really know about Sam? - I should find out everything I can.
why shouldn't you? He's your brother.
and a very dangerous man arrived on Wisteria Lane.
good neighbors...
they loan you cups of sugar...
they tell you why your car won't start...
they even help you find your lost pets.
I just wanna know who this person is...
good neighbors also come over at the slightest hint of trouble...
whether you want'em there or not.
being unreasonable! - You know what? I'm tired of fighting about this.
okay, fine. Walk away. It's what you always do.
Gaby, what are you doing?
uh...
I came to return this magazine Lee lent me, but you two were arguing, so...
so you decided it would be fun to eavesdrop?
God, it's like you see into my soul, and yet you don't judge. Thank you.
Oh, come on. Tell me what happened.
our egg donor backed out.
not again.
and the surrogate we hired will pull out - if the procedure isn't done in the next month. - Well, can't you find another egg donor?
we could, if Lee wasn't so picky. - Why are you discussing this with her?
for god sakes, I was eavesdropping. Catch up.
okay, yeah, I'm picky.
we spent two years choosing a mattress.
I'm not just going to get our child's DNA out of the yellow pages.
- If we lose the surrogate, - it could take months to find another one. - Yeah, and then she'll drop out for some ridiculous reason, and I can't take any more of this!
you know, maybe we're not supposed to be parents. - Don't talk like that!
come on! Doesn't it seem like - the universe is trying to tell us something? - Why not take mine?
take your what? - My eggs.
I mean, I've got plenty, and I hate to see you guys so unhappy.
so what the heck?
good neighbors... They're people who try to help others.
Oh!
bad neighbors are people who make promises they can't possibly keep.
the morning paper said a young girl was missing.
it quoted her family, who said she had vanished on her way to work.
it quoted her friends, who said she wasn't the type to run away from home.
it quoted the police, who said they had very little evidence to go on.
sadly, people didn't pay much attention to this bit of news.
no one thinks about evil until it shows up on their doorstep, which it soon would.
Oh, my god. Thief!
Hey! You!
Freeze! - Whoa! Whoa! Lady, put that thing down.
Oh, yeah? While I'm at it, why don't I just hand you the keys?
now hit the dirt! - Relax. I'm not stealing anything.
this is a repossession.
do I look stupid to you? Fire! Fire!
what the hell are you doing? - People come quicker when you yell "fire.
now I believe I told you to hit the dirt!
Where's the fire?
Susan, you okay?
I'm fine. Just call 911!
Hey, what's going on? - This thief is trying to steal your truck!
Hey. You're the guy who's four months behind on his payments?
Yeah.
stop, drop and roll!
stop, drop and roll!
why didn't you tell me you were having money problems?
I was hoping business would pick up before anybody found out.
but I guess that's no longer an option.
Mike, we talked about this.
I told you, I am willing to help.
and I told you, I'm not taking my wife's money.
well, enough with the macho pride.
I make a steady paycheck, and I have all that money from selling Karl's strip club.
no. I'm definitely not taking your ex-husband's money.
are we done here? - Sure. As long as you can explain how you're going to run a plumbing business without a truck.
I don't know. I'll figure it out.
and for the cover of the book, I see you in an evening gown, sitting on a bale of hay, ringing a dinner bell.
I love it. Such a sense of whimsy.
well, if it isn't the dynamic duo.
how did your meeting with the publisher go?
fantastic.
Bruce loved the idea of a nouvelle southern cookbook.
and your brother came up with the marketing slogan in the room. Tell him, Sam.
Mrs. Van de Kamp introduces you to upscale down-home cuisine.
catchy. I... I guess you know all about marketing, having an MBA and all.
I guess so.
except, of course, you don't actually have an MBA.
what are you talking about?
I made a few calls, checked a few records.
turns out the golden child never got his degree.
is this true?
Yes. I'm a few classes short.
is one of them ethics?
Andrew, please.
I don't understand.
it was the final semester.
we were about two months in when the doctor told me my mother was terminal.
I left school and brought her home so she didn't have to die in the hospital.
if you like, I can save you a phone call and bring in her death certificate.
that's okay.
the university let me graduate with my class.
I should finish my coursework next month.
but I'm sorry, Bree.
I should not have misrepresented myself.
everyone steps over the line now and then.
let's all make an effort not to, shall we?
this woman is incompetent. Why you bring me here?
Hey, you're the one who had to come to a Russian bridal shop.
it was mistake.
well... Look at the fun you're having chewing people out in your native tongue.
Hey.
sorry for the way she's been talking to you.
don't worry. You're not losing a son.
you are gaining a pain in the ass.
tell me about it.
my son is marrying a woman he barely knows.
he's making the biggest mistake of his life, and I am powerless to stop him.
if you like, maybe I get a little sloppy with the pushpins.
Aw, you're sweet.
Irina? It's your phone.
if it's Preston, tell him I be home soon.
okay, your highness.
bride's phone.
Irina...
okay. Slow down. I... I don't speak Russian.
Irina, it's some Russian guy, and he doesn't sound happy.
Alexei...
who was that?
wrong number.
wrong number? He asked for you by name.
if I wanted you to know, I would say it in English.
missus?
I can say it in English.
Hey. Double Cappuccino, extra hot.
need anything else?
inspiration.
sorry. We just have muffins.
what are you working on?
a novel.
I know... another guy in a coffee shop writing a novel.
just what the world needs.
no, I think it's cool. Mind if I ask what it's about?
you really wanna know?
I do.
it started out as a love story, but it's getting kind of dark.
this guy meets this girl, takes her from nothing, gives her life meaning.
basically creates her.
okay.
then one day, she just disappears...
vanishes...
with another man.
sucks for the guy.
and she takes his baby.
damn. Well, she sounds like a bitch.
sure her does.
anyhow, I'm up to the point where the guy who's been looking for her for a long time finally tracks her down.
and that's where I'm kind of stuck.
what does he do?
well, I don't know all the details, but you said it was dark, right?
Yeah.
seems to me the guy would kill her.
funny. That was exactly my first instinct, too.
no.
no? - You asked my permission to be an egg donor, and I said "no."
Oh, I wasn't asking you. I was telling you.
sorry. You can't do this without my approval.
those eggs are half mine.
how so? - I'm your husband.
I own 50% of whatever comes out of that uterus.
Oh! So you think you own my body.
I pay for the clothes it wears, the massages it receives and the implants it will one day require.
if I don't own it, I'm at least a major stockholder.
which means I can stop you from handing out your eggs like party favors to every childless gay couple that wanders by.
you cannot stop me. I can do whatever I want with my eggs.
and I can do whatever I want with the credit cards I pay for.
for example, I can cut them up.
I don't care about credit cards.
I am trying to do something noble here.
I'm helping these people become a family.
you've hidden the cards, haven't you?
damn straight.
okay, I am begging you, as your husband, please don't do this.
it'll be too weird having your DNA living next door.
I don't care. My mind is made up.
I am going to help Bob and Lee have a baby so they can experience the same love and joy that we occasionally have with our children.
so the Russian salesgirl translated for me, and you'll never guess what Irina said to the angry guy on the phone.
please don't make me guess.
she said, "go ahead and call the police."
you'll never find me.
and that's it?
how much more do you need?
she is a foreigner. She's done something criminal.
start your deportation now.
ma'am, without proof of criminal activity, there's nothing I can do.
can't you at least... interrogate her?
Yes, and... if you wanna slap her around a bit, you'll get no complaints from me.
look, Mrs. Scavo, we are a government agency.
we can't investigate your future daughter-in-law just because you don't think she's good for your son.
Ah. It all makes sense now.
you're single, right? Never had any kids?
Yeah. So?
you just don't get it.
Hi. Nice-looking family. Is that your daughter-in-law?
Yeah.
you two get along?
don't get me started.
got a minute?
M. J. , what are you doin'? - Clogging the sink.
what?
daddy needs work.
Ohh!
honey, that's sweet, but daddy only gets paid when other people have plumbing problems.
so I should do this to somebody else's sink?
no, honey.
that would be wrong.
Hi. I'm having a problem with Mike and his male ego.
long story short... can I clog your drain?
so don't phone Mike until I get home.
Ugh. Okay, and when you call him, sound desperate.
that way, he'll feel useful.
but don't call till Saturday. He gets double time on weekends.
there's enough there for a tip,
but careful when you give it to him.
I don't want him thinking anyone's doing him a favor.
trust me, Bruce. After they taste these recipes, they will be onboard.
just give me the chance to dazzle them.
okay. Bye.
problems?
Bruce got a little resistance when he met with the sales team.
they fear southern cookbooks are a tad overdone.
so I suggested we have a little dinner - to let them sample the recipes themselves. - Excellent.
we have to really impress them.
let's see if we can book the private dining room - at the Britannian hotel. - I'll take care of it.
but before I do, I have something... difficult to say.
well, I hope it's not about that silly MBA business.
I think I know why Andrew tried to discredit me yesterday.
Oh?
he knew you had me auditing the books, and he knew what I was gonna find.
what did you find?
did you charge the Donellys for five cases of Vodka?
Yeah. So?
according to our invoices, only four were delivered to their party.
and the Rotary Club luncheon was charged for seven cases of wine, - and only six showed up. - Why are you even looking at this stuff?
and I seem to recall your having a party that same weekend, with lots of wine and lots of Vodka.
okay, yeah, I... I took some leftover booze to my house for a party. What's the big deal?
it wasn't leftover. You charged the client for that liquor.
that's stealing. - Is Sam the one who told you about this?
we are not talking about Sam right now. - But we need to.
can't you see the type of person he is?
Yes, he is the type of person who leaves college to care for his dying mother.
you are the type of person who steals from clients.
believe what you wanna believe, but I'm not gonna listen to this.
Andrew.
don't you walk away from me!
can't you see how he's manipulating you?
how stupid can you be? - Apparently I'm stupid enough to have trusted you.
well, if I'm the problem, why not just fire me?
I'm tempted. Don't push me.
clear your things out and turn in your keys.
Oh, hey, Tom.
did Irina and Preston say when they'd be back from the mall?
stop!
stop what?
not you. I'm teaching Parker to drive.
okay. I'm planning to steal Irina's passport number.
Oh, god. What are you up to now?
I have a new best friend at immigration who's got a friend at the Russian embassy who's agreed to initiate a background search.
Lynette, this is getting out of hand.
that woman is hiding something, and I am taking her down.
da!
you buy me beautiful things, and now I thank you. - Ahh!
come on.
we shouldn't be in here with the door closed.
my mom gets a little freaked out. - Well, your mother is a prude.
that is what happens to women when they grow old.
now kiss me. - Mmm.
Mmm! Oh, my god.
who's that?
your mom.
get home now.
trapped behind the closet door.
Preston and Irina are about to...
pull over. I gotta get home fast.
I can go fast.
seriously, Irina, my mom's in the house.
I know. Is what make it fun.
Mmm.
honey maple short ribs drizzled with Manzanilla Sherry.
these are amazing.
Bruce's sales team will be powerless to resist.
well, you are really focused on this dinner, which is amazing considering what happened.
I mean... firing your own son.
I've done worse things to Andrew.
we have a... very complicated relationship.
you'll see that the longer you're at the company.
how? You fired him.
no, that's just our pattern.
he provokes me, and I push him away,
but we always come back together.
so... You're going to bring him back in?
eventually.
but the stealing...
and the way he spoke to you, I...
Sam, he's my son.
Hey. Busy day, huh?
Yeah, busy week.
it's so funny.
I've had all this work right here on the lane.
well, that's good, right?
especially since you don't have your truck.
uh... huh. Hey.
guess what I found?
Oh! My earring.
been looking all over for that. Where'd you find it?
Gaby's bathtub drain.
Oh.
Oh, of course.
Gaby and I went jogging, and, uh...
and then I hugged her, so my earring probably got caught in...in her...
sports bra, and when she went to take a bath...
Hey, do you, uh, wanna have sex?
so Gaby's drain, Angie's garbage disposal,
Lynette's toilet...
I mean, the really dirty sex.
so now I have to return all that money.
no, you don't.
I... gave it to them.
you're saying everyone on the street knows
I'm having financial trouble?
well... I think they already figured that out when they saw your truck get repossessed out of our driveway.
this is humiliating, Susan.
I'm sorry, but it all could've been prevented if you'd just let me make a few stupid payments on your truck.
I told you, I don't want your help.
this is my business, my problem.
you know, I don't remember all those "mys" in our wedding vows.
it's supposed to be a partnership.
if you can't let me help you, maybe there's something wrong with our marriage.
I'm not gonna listen to this, all right? I'm tired.
I had a busy day wasting my time.
I'll sleep on the couch.
Oh.
Danny?
you up there?
Hello?
Oh, Jeez, Nick, you scared me.
nothing. I just... I just got home,
and I... I thought I heard a noise. It...no, it's fine.
just hurry home, okay?
to Gabrielle Solis, the best neighbor - two childless, upwardly mobile gay guys could ever have. - Mm.
Hey!
no, no, no. That was purely ceremonial.
we don't want you drinking. - Why? Does it affect my fertility?
that, and you're kind of a sloppy drunk.
fine. Let's talk babies.
so... what are you guys hoping for...a boy or a girl?
I want a girl.
that way, we can put her in baby beauty pageants.
Yeah, they're so cute in their makeup and rhinestone dresses. - Right?
Really? You guys gonna do that?
why not? - Well, it's just I kind of dabbled in that world, - And for me, it was a bit much. - Well, don't panic. 50% chance it's a boy.
then it's makeup and rhinestone vests. - What?!
he's kidding.
Oh! He better be. There's no way I'm allowing that.
mm, now that I think about it,
I do hope we have a boy.
and why is that?
I already have two girls. I'm so sick of buying dresses.
when he's old enough,
I'm gonna take him on the biggest shopping spree ever.
I guess you can do that when we come back to visit.
visit? Where are you going? - My mother lives in upstate New York.
we thought we'd move closer to her.
so the baby can be around family.
Really?
is that a problem?
it just never occurred to me that you guys would leave and take my only son.
Gaby...
this child... It'll have your genes, but it won't be yours.
you get that, right?
of course.
I mean, it's the only way it can work, right?
come on. You ready?
okay, no peeking.
you gonna beat me again this time?
Hey, guys.
what?
mommy, why do you look so sad?
well, I was just thinking about what it would be like if I couldn't see your face every day...
and it made me sad.
what's going on?
come out of the kitchen.
I want you to spend some time with these people.
mingle. Have a drink.
I don't drink, Bruce. I'm an alcoholic. - One drink.
I'm not asking you to swing from the chandelier.
why are you so nervous?
I really put my neck on the line for this book, Bree.
no one likes the idea. No one.
Oh, I should've stopped at just one drink.
look, they are gonna love the food.
I hope so, because if they don't, I don't see how you're going to publish another book of any kind.
here you are.
just put them on a little plate. - Yeah, that'll be fine.
hop to, people. This is a big one.
something wrong? - What's this?
it's the Sherry we drizzle on the ribs.
this isn't Sherry. This is vinegar.
vinegar?
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
it's ruined.
they're all ruined. It's disgusting!
the floor's not looking so great either.
stop! We can't serve this food. - We've already taken out most of the plates.
well, don't just stand there. Go get them back.
how can it be vinegar?
we tested the recipe last night, and it was perfect, - And then I locked the Sherry in the liquor cabinet. - Who had access?
did you give Andrew's keys to anyone after you fired him?
he never returned his key.
Oh, Bree.
they won't give the plates back.
the publisher guy's giving a little speech, - and then they're gonna eat. - No, no, no, no.
I am not gonna lose my cookbook career over this.
God.
hand me that torch.
everybody.
we're serving cobbler in the parking lot!
I just made you real hot chocolate.
don't I get a smile?
my son tried to ruin my career tonight.
I don't think I'll ever smile again.
honestly, I don't think Andrew had anything to do with it.
you don't?
MNH. Look at the planning that went into it.
the vinegar had to be substituted for the Sherry after you'd selected the bottle but before you'd left for the event.
and the ingredient had to be something you wouldn't sample.
come on. Andrew's not clever enough to pull that off.
he can't even steal a case of wine without getting caught.
well, then who do you think did it?
well, it'd have to be somebody pretty smart...
at least smart enough to get an MBA.
Sam? That's ridiculous.
why would he want to hurt me?
who said he wanted to hurt you?
Andrew's the one taking this fall.
no, that's not possible.
what does he stand to gain?
hmm. What a good question.
enjoy your chocolate.
every once in a while, I catch Susan looking at me this certain way.
you know, I'm putting on my shirt or mowing the lawn.
I'll turn my head, and I'll catch her with this look in her eyes, and I know she's thinking that she's lucky to have me.
so how can I tell her I'm dead broke?
how can I say, "I can't take your money, because it won't begin to cover the debts I've been racking up for the last year"?
she thinks it's a couple of truck payments.
she's got no idea.
this would really hurt her.
if she found out I kept this from her,
I don't think I'd ever see that look from her again...
and I can't let that happen.
tell me how much you need.
double capp, extra hot, right?
Wow. Good memory.
I haven't seen you for a while. I thought maybe you left town.
Oh, I'm not leaving till I finish my book.
Oh, right, yeah. How's that goin'?
did the guy kill her?
I tried to write it that way.
he went over there. She was alone.
he had the chance.
and what happened?
just seemed too easy.
so you stuck again?
no.
I've got a better idea.
if you think about it, the worst part of what she did was taking the kid, right?
so I figure the best way for him to get revenge is to take something from her.
but what could he take that's gonna be as bad as what she did?
the kid.
he's gonna take the kid, right?
that's what I'm thinking.
Hey.
Hey.
so I guess Carlos talked to you guys?
he did.
I feel awful.
the more he thought about it, he just couldn't let me do this.
and let'face it, he does have a say.
it's completely understandable, Gaby. It was a lot to ask.
so where's Lee?
I wanna talk to him, too.
he left.
left?
after Carlos came over,
lee and I got into yet another fight,
and...
we broke up.
are you kidding me?
lee says he can't go through it again.
I'm determined to have a child,
so...
is there anything I can do?
Oh, right.
sorry.
it's okay, Gaby. Like I said, it was a lot to ask.
my left shoe is missing. - We'll find it.
I can't get married in one shoe. - Just get dressed.
the wedding starts in half an hour.
Hey, maybe he should wear sneakers.
it'd be wild, like he's too cool to care.
or I could... I just help him keep looking.
there you go.
Lynette! Help me look for Preston's shoe!
Lynette?
what are you doing?
I need your help. Preston can't find his shoe.
I put it in the oven.
Why?
because that woman at immigration never called me back, and I screwed.
Oh, honey. Come on.
hiding a shoe isn't gonna stop them from getting married.
I know. I just wanted a few more minutes before I had to tell my son I'm not going to his wedding.
Lynette...
I will not be a hypocrite, Tom.
I know how you feel.
but if you think Irina's got power now, just you wait until you don't show up to your son's wedding.
Oh, I wish...
I wish... I went to church more often.
I could really use a favor from the man upstairs.
right about now.
Mrs. Scavo?
you're not gonna believe what I found.
I'll see you Sunday morning.
you look beautiful.
Mm. Thank you.
I am guessing this one's much nicer than your first wedding dress, you know.
when you got married in Russia to...
alexei Kosokov?
here in America.
we actually get divorced before we get married again, otherwise you spend your honeymoon in jail.
alexei told me if I marry him, he will give me good life.
but he didn't.
he never worked.
he treat me badly.
now he won't sign the divorce papers unless I give him money.
Uh-huh.
okay.
that explains Alexei.
what about...
the guy in Italy...
who pressed charges after you cleaned out his bank account?
that guy was a pig.
believe me, I earned every penny.
we have a term in America for women who get paid for sex, and it's not "daughter-in-law.
you know why it doesn't bother me that you don't like me?
can't wait.
because it really doesn't matter.
all that matters is that one hour from now,
I will have a ring on this finger, and I will be the most important person in his life.
so give Preston your little file.
I will explain it all away, and he will believe every word.
he always does.
Preston.
mom, do you mind?
I need to talk to Irina.
Hi.
your father told me you called off the wedding.
obviously, I think you are doing the right thing.
I know you hate me right now, and I just want you to know that I am okay with that.
I love you so much.
I would rather have you resent me or even cut me off completely than to allow you to make a mistake that could ruin your life. So go ahead.
hate me for as long as you want.
and when you are done, I will be here waiting.
try not to take too long, cause I miss you already.
Hey.
Hey. Where you going?
motel, till I get flight out of this horrible place.
what? The Scavos couldn't even give you a lift?
that's harsh.
I want nothing from the Scavos.
they're dead to me.
lucky for you, I am not a Scavo.
sorry about the wedding.
it's Preston's loss, man.
I mean, he'll never get someone as hot as you again.
I don't want to talk about it.
sure. You know, I get that.
you know, if you wanna save money.
you could... you could always skip the motel and stay at my place.
I don't think so.
no, I promise, no... no funny business.
I mean...
unless you want some.
Yeah, I... I mean, think of it as a...
as a transition relationship.
it'll help you get over Preston.
I... I have no problem letting you use me...
okay, enough.
I'm a little out of your league, don't you think?
I mean, I didn't come to America to end up with some greasy-haired little boy.
what are you doing?!
Eddie?
we all know that evil exists.
the newspapers are filled with stories about young girls who suddenly vanish.
but we don't pay attention because we're worried about our marriages...
concerned about our friendships...
anxious about our employees.
Yes, we don't pay attention to evil because we think it will never come to our house.
but it does.
Hey, Mrs. Scavo. I'm here to pick up Porter for school.
and sometimes...
how you doin'?
we let it in.
Gaby learned a secret
lee and I are trying to adopt a baby.
Mike made a commitment but I can be a guy who takes care of his family.
Lynette was warned.
I told Preston I want to move up wedding to next week,
next week?
a killer put everyone on edge
can't believe she is dead
I gotta go home, My mom was so freaked out.
it could be minished, if she wants me to be around
so you're my brother?
half-brother, to be precise.
suspicious was born
and what do we really know about Sam?
... should be to find out everything I can.
why shouldn't you? He's your brother.
and a very dangerous man arrived on Wisteria lane.
good neighbors
they loan you cups of sugar...
they tell you why your car won't start...
they even help you find your lost pets.
good neighbors also come over
at the slightest hint of trouble...
whether you want 'em there or not.
...being unreasonable! You know what?
I'm tired of fighting about this.
okay, fine. Walk away. It's what you always do.
Gaby, what are you doing?
I came to return this magazine Lee lent me,
but you two were arguing, so...
so you decided it would be fun to eavesdrop?
God, it's like you see into my soul,
and yet you don't judge. Thank you.
Oh, come on. Tell me what happened.
our egg donor backed out.
not again.
and the surrogate we hired will pull out if the procedure isn't done in the next month.
well, can't you find another egg donor?
we could, if Lee wasn't so picky.
why are you discussing this with her?
for God sakes, I was eavesdropping. Catch up.
okay, yeah, I'm picky.
we spent two years choosing a mattress.
I'm not just going to get our child's D.N.A. out of the yellow pages.
if we lose the surrogate, It could take months to find another one.
Yeah, and then she'll drop out for some ridiculous reason,
and I can't take any more of this!
you know, maybe we're not supposed to be parents.
don't talk like that!
come on! Doesn't it seem like The universe is trying to tell us something?
why not take mine?
take your what? - My eggs.
I mean, I've got plenty,
and I hate to see you guys so unhappy.
so what the heck?
good neighbors--they're people who try to help others.
bad neighbors are people who make promises
they can't possibly keep.
the morning paper said a young girl was missing.
it quoted her family,
who said she had vanished on her way to work.
it quoted her friends,
who said she wasn't the type to run away from home.
it quoted the police,
who said they had very little evidence to go on.
sadly, people didn't pay much attention to this bit of news.
no one thinks about evil
until it shows up on their doorstep,
which it soon would.
Oh, my God. Thief!
Hey! You!
Freeze! Whoa! Whoa! Lady, put that thing down.
Oh, yeah? While I'm at it, why don't I just hand you the keys?
now hit the dirt! - Relax. I'm not stealing anything.
this is a repossession.
do I look stupid to you? Fire! Fire!
what the hell are you doing?
people come quicker when you yell "Fire."
now I believe I told you to hit the dirt!
Where's the fire?
Susan, you okay?
I'm fine. Just call 9-1-1!
Hey, what's going on?
this thief is trying to steal your truck!
Hey. You're the guy who's four months behind on his payments?
Yeah.
stop, drop and roll!
stop, drop and roll!
Whoblems?
I was hoping business would pick up before anybody found out.
but I guess that's no longer an option.
Mike, we talked about this.
I told you, I am willing to help.
and I told you, I'm not taking my wife's money.
well, enough with the macho pride.
I make a steady paycheck,
and I have all that money from selling Karl's strip club.
no. I'm definitely not taking your ex-husband's money.
are we done here? - Sure.
as long as you can explain how you're going to run a plumbing business without a truck.
I don't know. I'll figure it out.
and for the cover of the book, I see you in an evening gown,
sitting on a bale of hay, ringing a dinner bell.
I love it. Such a sense of whimsy.
well, if it isn't the dynamic duo.
how did your meeting with the publisher go?
fantastic.
Bruce loved the idea of a nouvelle Southern cookbook.
and your brother came up with the marketing slogan in the room.
tell him, Sam.
Mrs. Van De Kamp
introduces you to upscale down-home cuisine.
catchy. I-I guess you know all about marketing,
having an mba and all.
I guess so.
except, of course, you don't actually have an mba.
what are you talking about?
I made a few calls, checked a few records.
turns out the golden child never got his degree.
is this true?
Yes. I'm a few classes short.
is one of them ethics?
Andrew, please.
I don't understand.
it was the final semester.
we were about two months in
when the doctor told me my mother was terminal.
I left school and brought her home
so she didn't have to die in the hospital.
if you like,
I can save you a phone call
and bring in her death certificate.
that's okay.
the university let me graduate with my class.
I should finish my coursework next month.
but I'm sorry, Bree.
I should not have misrepresented myself.
everyone steps over the line now and then.
let's all make an effort not to,
shall we?
this woman is incompetent. Why you bring me here?
Hey, you're the one who had to come to a Russian bridal shop.
it was mistake.
well... Look at the fun you're having
chewing people out in your native tongue.
Hey.
sorry for the way she's been talking to you.
don't worry. You're not losing a son.
you are gaining a pain in the ass.
tell me about it.
my son is marrying a woman he barely knows.
he's making the biggest mistake of his life,
and I am powerless to stop him.
if you like, Maybe I get a little sloppy with the pushpins.
Aw, you're sweet.
Irina? It's your phone.
if it's Preston, tell him I be home soon.
okay, your highness.
bride's phone. - Irina...
okay. Slow down. I... I don't speak Russian.
Irina, it's some Russian guy, and he doesn't sound happy.
who was that?
wrong number.
wrong number? He asked for you by name.
if I wanted you to know, I would say it in English.
missus?
I can say it in English.
Hey. Double cappuccino, extra hot.
need anything else?
inspiration.
sorry. We just have muffins.
what are you working on?
a novel.
I know--another guy in a coffee shop writing a novel.
just what the world needs.
no, I think it's cool. Mind if I ask what it's about?
you really wanna know?
I do.
it started out as a love story,
but it's getting kind of dark.
this guy meets this girl,
takes her from nothing,
gives her life meaning.
basically creates her.
okay.
then one day,
she just disappears...
vanishes...
with another man.
sucks for the guy.
and she takes his baby.
damn. Well, she sounds like a bitch.
sure does.
anyhow, I'm up to the point
where the guy who's been looking for her for a long time
finally tracks her down.
and that's where I'm kind of stuck.
what does he do?
well, I don't know all the details,
but you said it was dark, right?
Yeah.
seems to me the guy would kill her.
funny. That was exactly my first instinct, too.
no. - No?
you asked my permission to be an egg donor, and I said "No."
Oh, I wasn't asking you. I was telling you.
sorry. You can't do this without my approval.
those eggs are half mine.
how so? - I'm your husband.
I own 50% of whatever comes out of that uterus.
Oh! So you think you own my body.
I pay for the clothes it wears,
the massages it receives
and the implants it will one day require.
if I don't own it, I'm at least a major stockholder.
which means I can stop you
from handing out your eggs like party favors
to every childless gay couple that wanders by.
you cannot stop me. I can do whatever I want with my eggs.
and I can do whatever I want with the credit cards I pay for.
for example, I can cut them up.
I don't care about credit cards.
I am trying to do something Noble here.
I'm helping these people become a family.
you've hidden the cards, haven't you?
damn straight.
okay, I am begging you, As your husband,
please don't do this.
it'll be too weird having your D.N.A. living next door.
I don't care. My mind is made up.
I am going to help Bob and Lee have a baby
so they can experience the same love and joy that we occasionally have with our children.
so the Russian salesgirl translated for me,
and you'll never guess what Irina said to the angry guy on the phone.
please don't make me guess.
she said,"Go ahead and call the police."
you'll never find me.
and that's it?
how much more do you need?
she is a foreigner. She's done something criminal.
start your deportation now.
ma'am, without proof of criminal activity,
there's nothing I can do.
can't you at least... Interrogate her?
Yes, and... If you wanna slap her around a bit,
you'll get no complaints from me.
look, Mrs. Scavo, we are a government agency.
we can't investigate your future daughter-in-law
just because you don't think she's good for your son.
Ah. It all makes sense now.
you're single, right? Never had any kids?
Yeah. So?
you just don't get it.
Hi. Nice-looking family. Is that your daughter-in-law?
Yeah.
you two get along?
don't get me started.
got a minute?
M. J.what are you doin'?
clogging the sink.
what?
daddy needs work.
honey, that's sweet, but daddy only gets paid when other people have plumbing problems.
so I should do this to somebody else's sink?
no, honey.
that would be wrong.
Hi. I'm having a problem with Mike and his male ego.
long story short-- can I clog your drain?
so don't phone Mike until I get home.
Ugh. Okay, and when you call him, sound desperate.
that way, he'll feel useful.
but don't call till Saturday. He gets double time on weekends.
there's enough there for a tip,
but careful when you give it to him.
I don't want him thinking anyone's doing him a favor.
trust me, Bruce. After they taste these recipes,
they will be onboard.
just give me the chance to dazzle them.
okay. Bye.
problems?
Bruce got a little resistance when he met with the sales team.
they fear Southern cookbooks are a tad overdone.
so I suggested we have a little dinner
to let them sample the recipes themselves.
excellent.
we have to really impress them.
let's see if we can book the private dining room at the britannian hotel.
I'll take care of it.
but before I do, I have something... Difficult to say.
well, I hope it's not about that silly mba business.
I think I know why Andrew tried to discredit me yesterday.
he knew you had me auditing the books,
and he knew what I was gonna find.
what did you find?
did you charge the donellys for five cases of vodka?
Yeah. So?
according to our invoices,
only four were delivered to their party.
and the rotary club luncheon was charged for seven cases of wine,
and only six showed up.
why are you even looking at this stuff?
and I seem to recall your having a party that same weekend,
with lots of wine and lots of vodka.
okay, yeah, I-I took some leftover booze to my house for a party.
what's the big deal? - It wasn't leftover.
you charged the client for that liquor.
that's stealing.
is Sam the one who told you about this?
we are not talking about Sam right now. - But we need to.
can't you see the type of person he is?
Yes, he is the type of person who leaves college
to care for his dying mother.
you are the type of person who steals from clients.
believe what you wanna believe,
but I'm not gonna listen to this.
don't you walk away from me!
can't you see how he's manipulating you?
how stupid can you be?
apparently I'm stupid enough to have trusted you.
well, if I'm the problem, why not just fire me?
I'm tempted. Don't push me.
clear your things out and turn in your keys.
Oh, hey, Tom.
did Irina and Preston say when they'd be back from the mall?
stop!
stop what?
not you. I'm teaching Parker to drive.
okay. I'm planning to steal Irina's passport number.
Oh, God. What are you up to now?
I have a new best friend at immigration
who's got a friend at the Russian embassy
who's agreed to initiate a background search.
Lynette, this is getting out of hand.
that woman is hiding something, and I am taking her down.
you buy me beautiful things, and now I thank you. Ahh!
come on.
we shouldn't be in here with the door closed.
my mom gets a little freaked out.
well, your mother is a prude.
that is what happens to women when they grow old.
now kiss me. Mmm.
Mmm! Oh, my God.
who's that?
your mom.
get home now.
trapped behind the closet door.
Preston and Irina are about to
pull over. I gotta get home fast.
I can go fast.
seriously, Irina, my mom's in the house.
I know. Is what make it fun.
honey maple short ribs drizzled with manzanilla Sherry.
these are amazing.
Bruce's sales team will be powerless to resist.
well, you are really focused on this dinner,
which is amazing considering what happened.
I mean... Firing your own son.
I've done worse things to Andrew.
we have a... Very complicated relationship.
you'll see that the longer you're at the company.
how? You fired him.
no, that's just our pattern.
he provokes me, and I push him away,
but we always come back together.
so... You're going to bring him back in?
eventually.
but the stealing...
and the way he spoke to you, I...
Sam, he's my son.
Hey. Busy day, huh?
Yeah, busy week.
it's so funny.
I've had all this work right here on the lane.
well, that's good, right?
especially since you don't have your truck.
Uh-huh. Hey.
guess what I found?
Oh! My earring.
been looking all over for that. Where'd you find it?
Gaby's bathtub drain.
Oh.
Ohh, of course.
Gaby and I went jogging, and, uh...
so my earring probably got caught in--in her...
sports bra, and when she went to take a bath
Hey, do you, uh, wanna have sex?
so Gaby's drain, Angie's garbage disposal,
Lynette's toilet
I mean, the really dirty sex.
so now I have to return all that money.
no, you don't.
I...
gave it to them.
you're saying everyone on the street knows I'm having financial trouble?
well... I think they already figured that out
when they saw your truck get repossessed out of our driveway.
this is humiliating, Susan.
I'm sorry, but it all could've been prevented
if you'd just let me make a few stupid payments on your truck.
I told you, I don't want your help.
this is my business, my problem.
you know, I don't remember all those "Mys"In our wedding vows.
it's supposed to be a partnership.
if you can't let me help you,
maybe there's something wrong with our marriage.
I'm not gonna listen to this, all right? I'm tired.
I had a busy day wasting my time.
I'll sleep on the couch.
you up there?
Hello?
Oh, jeez, Nick, you scared me.
nothing. I just I just got home, And I-I thought I heard a noise.
It--no, it's fine.
just hurry home, okay?
to Gabrielle solis, the best neighbor Two childless, upwardly mobile gay guys could ever have.
I got it.
no, no, no. That was purely ceremonial.
we don't want you drinking.
Why? Does it affect my fertility?
that, and you're kind of a sloppy drunk.
fine. Let's talk babies.
so...
what are you guys hoping for
a boy or a girl?
I want a girl.
that way, we can put her in baby beauty pageants.
Yeah, they're so cute in their makeup and rhinestone dresses.
right? - Really? You guys gonna do that?
why not?
well, it's just I kind of dabbled in that world,
and for me, it was a bit much.
well, don't panic.
50% chance it's a boy.
then it's makeup and rhinestone vests.
What?!
he's kidding.
he better be.
there's no way I'm allowing that.
mm, now that I think about it, I do hope we have a boy.
and why is that?
I already have two girls.
I'm so sick of buying dresses.
when he's old enough,
I'm gonna take him on the biggest shopping spree ever.
right.
I guess you can do that when we come back to visit.
visit? Where are you going?
my mother lives in upstate New York.
we thought we'd move closer to her
so the baby can be around family.
Really?
is that a problem?
it just never occurred to me
that you guys would leave and take my only son.
this child--it'll have your genes, But it won't be yours.
you get that, right?
of course.
I mean, it's the only way it can work, right?
come on. You ready?
okay, no peeking.
you gonna beat me again this time?
Hey, guys.
what?
mommy, why do you look so sad?
well, I was just thinking about what it would be like
if I couldn't see your face every day...And it made me sad.
what's going on?
come out of the kitchen.
I want you to spend some time with these people.
mingle. Have a drink.
I don't drink, Bruce. I'm an alcoholic.
one drink.
I'm not asking you to swing from the chandelier.
why are you so nervous?
I really put my neck on the line for this book, Bree.
no one likes the idea.
no one.
Oh, I should've stopped at just one drink.
look, they are gonna love the food.
I hope so, because if they don't,
I don't see how you're going to publish another book of any kind.
hop to, people.
this is a big one.
something wrong?
what's this?
it's the Sherry we drizzle on the ribs.
this isn't Sherry.
this is vinegar.
vinegar?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
it's ruined.
they're all ruined. It's disgusting!
the floor's not looking so great either.
stop! We can't serve this food.
we've already taken out most of the plates.
well, don't just stand there. Go get them back.
how can it be vinegar?
we tested the recipe last night, and it was perfect,
and then I locked the Sherry in the liquor cabinet.
who had access?
did you give Andrew's keys to anyone after you fired him?
he never returned his key.
Oh, Bree.
they won't give the plates back.
the publisher guy's giving a little speech,
and then they're gonna eat.
no, no, no, no. I am not gonna lose my cookbook career over this.
God.
hand me that torch.
we're serving cobbler in the parking lot!
I just made you real hot chocolate.
don't I get a smile?
my son tried to ruin my career tonight.
I don't think I'll ever smile again.
honestly, I don't think Andrew had anything to do with it.
you don't?
look at the planning that went into it.
the vinegar had to be substituted for the Sherry
after you'd selected the bottle
but before you'd left for the event.
and the ingredient had to be something you wouldn't sample.
come on. Andrew's not clever enough to pull that off.
he can't even steal a case of wine without getting caught.
well, then who do you think did it?
well, it'd have to be somebody pretty smart...
at least smart enough to get an mba.
that's ridiculous. Why would he want to hurt me?
who said he wanted to hurt you?
Andrew's the one taking this fall.
no, that's not possible.
what does he stand to gain?
what a good question.
enjoy your chocolate.
every once in a while, I catch Susan looking at me this certain way.
you know, I'm putting on my shirt or mowing the lawn.
I'll turn my head, and I'll catch her with this look in her eyes,
and I know she's thinking that she's lucky to have me.
so how can I tell her I'm dead broke?
how can I say,"I can't take your money,
because it won't begin to cover the debts I've been racking up for the last year"?
she thinks it's a couple of truck payments.
she's got no idea.
this would really hurt her.
if she found out I kept this from her,
I don't think I'd ever see that look from her again...
and I can't let that happen.
tell me how much you need.
double capp, extra hot, right?
Wow.
good memory.
I haven't seen you for a while.
I thought maybe you left town.
Oh, I'm not leaving till I finish my book.
Oh, right, yeah. How's that goin'?
did the guy kill her?
I tried to write it that way.
he went over there. She was alone.
he had the chance.
and what happened?
just seemed too easy.
so you stuck again?
no.
I've got a better idea.
if you think about it, the worst part of what she did was taking the kid, right?
so I figure the best way for him to get revenge...
is to take something from her.
but what could he take that's gonna be as bad as what she did?
the kid.
he's gonna take the kid, right?
that's what I'm thinking.
he did.
I feel awful.
the more he thought about it, he just couldn't let me do this.
and let's face it, he does have a say.
it's completely understandable, Gaby.
it was a lot to ask.
so where's Lee? I wanna talk to him, too.
he left.
left?
after Carlos came over,
lee and I got into yet another fight, And...
we broke up.
are you kidding me?
lee says he can't go through it again.
I'm determined to have a child, So...
is there anything I can do?
Oh, right.
sorry.
it's okay, Gaby. Like I said, it was a lot to ask.
my left shoe is missing.
we'll find it. - I can't get married in one shoe.
just get dressed. The wedding starts in half an hour.
Hey, maybe he should wear sneakers.
it'd be wild, like he's too cool to care.
or I could--I just help him keep looking.
there you go.
help me look for Preston's shoe!
what are you doing?
I need your help. Preston can't find his shoe.
I put it in the oven.
Why?
because that woman at immigration
never called me back, And I am screwed.
Oh, honey.
come on.
hiding a shoe isn't gonna stop them from getting married.
I know.
I just wanted a few more minutes
before I had to tell my son I'm not going to his wedding.
I will not be a hypocrite, Tom.
I know how you feel.
but if you think Irina's got power now,
just you wait until you don't show up to your son's wedding.
Oh, I wish...
I wish...
I went to church more often.
I could really use a favor from the man upstairs right about now.
Mrs. Scavo?
you're not gonna believe what I found.
I'll see you Sunday morning.
you look beautiful.
thank you.
I am guessing this one's much nicer
than your first wedding dress, you know,
when you got married in Russia to...
alexei kosokov?
here in America we actually get divorced before we get married again,
otherwise you spend your honeymoon in jail.
alexei told me If I marry him, he will give me good life.
but he didn't.
he never worked.
he treat me badly.
now he won't sign the divorce papers unless I give him money.
okay.
that explains Alexei.
what about...
the guy in Italy...
who pressed charges after you cleaned out his bank account?
that guy was a pig.
believe me, I earned every Penny.
we have a term in America for women who get paid for sex,
and it's not "Daughter-in-law."
you know why it doesn't bother me that you don't like me?
can't wait.
because it really doesn't matter.
all that matters is that one hour from now,
I will have a ring on this finger,
and I will be the most important person in his life.
so give Preston your little file.
I will explain it all away,
and he will believe every word.
he always does.
mom, do you mind?
I need to talk to Irina.
your father told me you called off the wedding.
obviously, I think you are doing the right thing.
I know you hate me right now, and I just want you to know that I am okay with that.
I love you so much.
I would rather have you resent me or even cut me off completely
than to allow you to make a mistake that could ruin your life.
so go ahead.
hate me for as long as you want,
and when you are done, I will be here waiting.
try not to take too long,'cause I miss you already.
Hey.
where you going?
motel, Till I get flight out of this horrible place.
what? The Scavos couldn't even give you a lift?
that's harsh.
I want nothing from the Scavos.
they're dead to me.
lucky for you, I am not a Scavo.
sorry about the wedding.
it's Preston's loss, man.
I mean, he'll never get someone as hot as you again.
I don't want to talk about it.
sure. You know, I get that.
you know, if you wanna save money, You could
you could always skip the motel and stay at my place.
I don't think so.
no, I promise, no
no funny business. I mean...
unless you want some.
Yeah, I-I mean, think of it as a
as a transition relationship.
it'll help you get over Preston.
I-I have no problem letting you use me
okay, enough.
I'm a little out of your league, don't you think?
I mean, I didn't come to America to end up with some greasy-haired little boy.
what are you doing?!
we all know that evil exists.
the newspapers are filled with stories about young girls who suddenly vanish.
but we don't pay attention because we're worried about our marriages...
concerned about our friendships...
anxious about our employees.
Yes, we don't pay attention to evil because we think it will never come to our house.
but it does.
Hey, Mrs. Scavo.
I'm here to pick up Porter for school.
and sometimes... - How you doin'?
good.
we let it in.
I WANT A CHI.
we MADE A DEAL -- NO KIDS.
tampering WITH PRESCRIPTIONS...
the FILE ON NOAH'S DAUGHTER.
uncovering EVIDENCE...
what ARE WE LOOKING FOR, EXACTLY?
what WAS THAT?
breaking AND ENTERING...
Bree IS A LADY.
a VERY BEAUTIFUL, CLASSY LADY.
remember, THEY TEND TO END UP WITH DOCTORS,
not PHARMACISTS.
and A WHOLE LOT OF REVENGE.
since SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL,
Susan MAYER WANTED TO BE A MOTHER IN THE WORST WAY.
Oh, WHERE'S YOUR BOTTOM? YOU'RE SO CUTE. YEAH.
and FROM THE FIRST DAY
she BROUGHT JULIE HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL...
Oh! OOH, HOW DID YOU...
she WAS.
Oh, MY GOSH.
despite HER DESIRE TO DO WELL BY HER DAUGHTER...
Susan SUFFERED THROUGH COUNTLESS FAILURES. - OH, I'M SO SORRY!
how DID I FORGET...
of COURSE, IT TOOK SUSAN A FEW YEARS TO REALIZE
even THE BEST OF PARENTS
make MISTAKES NOW AND THEN.
but NOW THAT JULIE WAS A TEENAGE GIRL,
Susan HAD STARTED TO REALIZE
there WAS NO ROOM FOR ERROR.
Julie, WHAT IS ZACH DOING OUT THERE?
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU NOT TO SPEAK TO HIM ANYMORE.
I'm NOT.
that's WHY HE'S THROWING GRAVEL AT MY WINDOW.
all RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
I'm GOING TO HANDLE THIS ONCE AND FOR ALL.
Zach, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE -- OW!
Aah! OH! OH!
ms. MAYER, I AM SO SORRY.
it's JUST...
you KNOW, ONE PEBBLE WASN'T WORKING,
so I TRIED A WHOLE HANDFUL.
ow, OW.
look, I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
Oh, HOW?
are YOU GOING TO GIVE ME YOUR CORNEAS? - MOM, LAY BACK.
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO JULIE.
she HASN'T BEEN RETURNING MY PHONE CALLS.
well, I'M HERE NOW.
what DO YOU WANT?
come ON, JULIE.
I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
you KNOW, TALK, HANG OUT.
maybe IT WOULD BE BETTER, IF WE JUST COOLED IT FOR A WHILE, OKAY?
Why?
well, YOU JUST THREW ROCKS IN HER MOTHER'S FACE.
how's THAT FOR A START?
thank YOU SO MUCH.
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO BREAK UP WITH HIM FOR WEEKS.
you FINALLY GAVE ME AN EXCUSE.
Yes, SUSAN HAD FAILED MANY TIMES AS A MOTHER...
you DID GOOD, MOM.
so SHE TOOK HER VICTORIES WHERE SHE FOUND THEM.
you're WELCOME.
spring COMES EVERY YEAR TO WISTERIA LANE.
it's THE TIME WHEN FLOWERS START TO BLOOM,
when BUTTERFLIES EMERGE FROM THEIR COCOONS,
when BEES BEGIN TO SEARCH FOR NECTAR.
spring IS ALSO THE TIME WHEN A YOUNG MAN'S FANCY TURNS TO OBSESSION.
hello THERE.
Oh, MY HEAVENLY DAYS.
Rex, LOOK...IT'S GEORGE.
it's NICE TO SEE YOU, BREE.
Dr. VAN DE KAMP.
so, HOW'S YOUR HEALTH?
not GOOD, AND MY CARDIOLOGIST IS AN IDIOT.
the DOCTOR UPPED HIS DOSAGE TWICE,
and IT'S STILL NOT HELPING.
I'm SURE IT'LL ALL WORK ITSELF OUT.
you KNOW, IT'S FUNNY RUNNING INTO YOU BOTH.
I HAPPEN TO HAVE EXTRA TICKETS TO A BONSAI EXPOSITION IN MOUNT PLEASANT FRIDAY NIGHT.
would YOU LIKE TO GO?
I WOULD LOVE TO. REX?
a WHOLE EVENING OF BONSAI TREES?
wouldn't IT JUST BE EASIER TO SHOOT ME?
probably.
well, WHY DON'T WE JUST GO BY OURSELVES, THEN?
we HAVE THAT THING FRIDAY NIGHT.
what THING?
we DON'T HAVE A THING.
I THINK WHAT YOUR HUSBAND IS TRYING TO SAY
is THAT HE DOESN'T WANT YOU GOING OUT WITH ME.
Rex, ARE YOU STILL JEALOUS?
no.
it's TRUE THAT WE DATED DURING THE SEPARATION,
but GEORGE AND I ARE JUST FRIENDS NOW, AREN'T WE?
strictly PLATONIC.
but IF YOU FEEL THREATENED...
I DON'T FEEL THREATENED.
good.
then IT'S A DATE.
so ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE A PURCHASE TODAY?
do YOU KNOW, I HAVE FINALLY CONVINCED REX TO BUY HIS FIRST ORCHID.
make SURE YOU STUDY UP.
I HATE PEOPLE WHO OWN PRECIOUS FLOWERS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE PROPER CARE OF THEM.
you KNOW WHAT I HATE? WEEDS.
they JUST POP UP OUT OF NOWHERE,
and YOU HAVE TO WORK SO HARD TO GET RID OF THEM.
I FIND WITH THE RIGHT CHEMICALS,
you CAN GET RID OF ALMOST ANYTHING.
see YOU FRIDAY.
Mrs. SOLIS.
what A SURPRISE.
we HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN HERE IN QUITE SOME TIME.
Yes, YES, I KNOW.
my HUSBAND AND I WENT THROUGH A DOWNSIZING PHASE,
but WE'VE SNAPPED OUT OF IT.
life IS GOOD.
Oh, AND THIS WOULD MAKE IT SO MUCH BETTER.
excellent.
slip INSIDE. SEE HOW THAT FEELS.
Oh.
I'd LOVE TO HAVE THIS IN MY DRIVEWAY BY SATURDAY.
I'm HAVING A BIG BARBECUE.
I WANT EVERYONE TO SEE IT.
how EXCITING.
what's THE OCCASION?
I'm THROWING MY HUSBAND A GOING-AWAY PARTY.
Really? WHERE'S HE GOING?
it's, UM...
it's A SORT OF GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED SABBATICAL.
how LONG IS HE GOING TO BE GONE?
eight MONTHS.
six WITH GOOD BEHAVIOR.
isn't THE LEATHER INTERIOR WONDERFUL?
it IS. IT IS.
it's JUST THE SMELL'S A LITTLE INTENSE.
that's BECAUSE IT WAS IMPORTED FROM ITALY.
it's 100% ITALIAN CALF.
I AM SO SORRY.
it JUST HIT ME OUT OF NOWHERE.
you KNOW, IT'S SO WEIRD.
smells HAVE BEEN MAKING ME NAUSEOUS LATELY.
boobs TENDER? ACHY BACK?
Yeah.
has IT BEEN GOING AROUND?
only FOR CENTURIES.
I WENT THROUGH IT ALL WHEN I WAS CARRYING MY OLDEST.
the TRUTH IS,
you're NEVER GOING TO FIT A CHILD SAFETY SEAT IN THE BACK OF THAT TINY SPYDER ANYWAY.
the 4-DOORS ARE MUCH ROOMIER.
what -- WAIT --UH, I'M SORRY
you THINK I'M PREGNANT?
no, I'M NOT PREGNANT.
Oh, YOU JUST HAVE ALL THE SYMPTOMS.
I-I JUST ASSUMED... - WELL, YOU ASSUMED WRONG.
well, I'M SORRY.
I'm ON THE PILL, FOR GOD'S SAKES. - OKAY.
you KNOW, AND ANOTHER THING, I DON'T WANT A 4-DOOR.
I WANT A SEXY CONVERTIBLE, AND I WANT TO BUY ONE RIGHT NOW.
I'll GO START THE PAPERWORK.
well, NOT THIS ONE.
I VOMITED IN THIS ONE.
right.
we'll FIND YOU A FRESH ONE.
peterson ADVERTISING. MAY I HELP YOU?
you FORGOT YOUR HALPERN FILE.
Oh, MY GOD. LYNETTE.
if THERE WAS ONE PERSON
Lynette NEVER EXPEED TO SEE AGAIN,
it WAS ANNABEL FOSTER.
eight YEARS EARLIER,
annabel HAD BEGGED TOM TO MARRY HER,
but HE TOLD HER HE WASN'T THE MARRYING KIND.
then ONE DAY,
Tom HAPPENED TO MEET A RISING YOUNG EXECUTIVE
by THE NAME OF LYNETTE LINDQUIST...
and AFTER A FEW TORRID WEEKS,
Tom DECIDED PERHAPS
he WAS THE MARRYING KIND AFTER ALL,
causing AN EMBITTERED ANNABEL TO MOVE BACK TO CHICAGO PERMANENTLY...
or SO LYNETTE HAD HOPED.
you LOOK FANTASTIC. - HA HA HA. THANK YOU.
and YOU
you're HERE IN THE OFFICE
Tom's OFFICE.
Yeah, GOING ON THREE MONTHS NOW.
Oh.
didn't TOM TELL YOU?
it, UH...
must HAVE SLIPPED HIS MIND.
Ah, AFRAID TO TELL THE WIFE
you're WORKING WITH THE OLD GIRLFRIEND, HUH?
I GUESS THAT MAKES ME YOUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.
well, I'LL LET YOU GET BACK TO WORK.
see YOU LATER.
can't WAIT.
Oh, I ALMOST FORGOT.
your FILE. HERE.
Hey, PAUL. WHAT'S UP?
something's BEEN NAGGING ME, EDIE.
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT. - OKAY.
that NIGHT I FOUND YOU IN MY HOUSE
why WERE YOU REALLY THERE?
well, YOU KNOW WHY.
I CAME BY TO DROP OFF YOUR KEY.
some THINGS WERE MOVEAROUND MY LIVING ROOM.
what WERE YOU LOOKING FOR?
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
do I HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE?
do WHATEVER YOU WANT.
suit YOURSELF.
okay.
Susan MADE ME DO IT.
she HAS THIS FIXATION ON WHY MARY ALICE KILLED HERSELF,
and SHE KEEPS BLATHERING ON ABOUT BLACKMAIL NOTES
and DEAD BABIES
Oh, AND SHE GOT REALLY HOT AND BOTHERED WHEN SHE FOUND THE NAME ANGELA WRITTEN ON ONE OF YOUR VIDETAPES.
did SHE FIND WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR?
no, YOU CAME HOME BEFORE SHE HAD A CHANCE TO WATCH THE VIDEO.
I SEE.
she SORT OF THINKS YOU'RE EVIL.
thank YOU, EDIE.
what WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
Susan MAYER'S OBSESSION WITH MARY ALICE ALMOST GOT ME ARRESTED.
now PAUL'S AFTER HER.
if I LIKED HER BETTER, I'D WARN HER, BUT...
you KNOW.
Thanks.
uh, I'LL TALK TO YOU GIRLS LATER.
still AVOIDING ME, HUH?
no, NO.
what DO YOU WANT?
I HEARD THAT YOU AND EDIE BROKE INTO PAUL YOUNG'S HOUSE.
who TOLD YOU THAT?
Yeah, WE DID. UM...
we WERE JUST LOOKING...
it DOESN'T MATTER. IT WAS DUMB.
listen, I WANT YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT GUY.
well, I WAS PLANNING ON DOING THAT ANYWAY.
good.
I KNOW WHY I WAS PLANNING ON STAYING AWAY FROM HIM.
why DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM?
I JUST KNOW HE'S A BAD GUY.
so PLEASE DON'T MESS WITH HIM.
I WON'T.
I PROMISE.
so I'VE BEEN THINKIN ABOUT THE PHARMACIST.
George. WHAT ABOUT HIM?
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD GO OUT WITH HIM.
please DON'T BE THIS WAY.
he's THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE WHO'S INTERESTED IN CULTURAL THINGS.
I'm WORRIED BECAUSE HE IS OBVIOUSLY STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU.
no, HE JUST WANTS TO BE FRIENDS.
he TOLD ME SO.
well, WHAT ELSE WOULD A MAN IN LOVE SAY?
he's DESPERATE TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.
he DOES NOT SEEM DESPERATE TO ME.
I SAW THE WAY HIS HANDS TREMBLED WHEN YOU TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER.
they DID?
when WE FIRST STARTED DATING, THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME.
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
listen, CONTINUING TO SEE HIM WOULD JUST BE GIVING HIM FALSE HOPE.
well, I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM AGAIN.
no.
you DON'T.
I EVEN THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO SWITCH PHARMACIES.
Really?
well, OKAY.
you KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO MISS MOST ABOUT HIM?
george ALWAYS HAS A WAY OF MAKING ME FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.
Yeah, HE'S A TERRIFIC GUY.
honey, DO YOUR HANDS STILL TREMBLE WHEN THEY TOUCH ME?
no.
but COME ON, WE'VE BEEN MARRIED 18 YEARS.
Yes, WE HAVE.
and YOU STILL DON'T KNOW WHEN I NEED YOU TO LIE.
excuse ME.
um, THIS HOME PREGNANCY TEST...IS IT A GOOD ONE?
I GUESS.
okay, UM, DO YOU HAVE A RESTROOM?
it's FOR EMPLOYEES ONLY.
Oh, IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE,
Mrs. SOLIS. HELP YOURSELF.
thank U.
what DID I TELL YOU ABOUT BEING RUDE TO CUSTOMERS?
you'll STICK A SMILE ON YOUR FACE,
or I'LL KEEP YOU IN BACK STOCKING SHELVES WHERE NO ONE HAS TO LOOK AT YOU.
what A PLEASANT SURPRISE.
what BRINGS YOU HERE?
didn't WE JUST FILL DR. VAN DE KAMP'S PRESCRIPTION LAST WEEK?
George, AS IT TURNS OUT,
I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO WITH YOU TO THE BONSAI EXPO.
Oh. WHY NOT?
I THINK IT'D BE A MISTAKE FOR US TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER.
Dr. VAN DE KAMP SAID SOMETHING ABOUT ME.
what WAS IT?
it DOESN'T MATTER.
please, TELL ME.
he SAID YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH ME.
that's
that's STUPID.
I'm NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU.
I'm NOT.
the TRUTH IS,
I'm IN LOVE WITH GINGER.
ginger THE STOCK GIRL?
Yes. IT'S VERY SERIOUS.
Oh.
why DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
well, WE'RE TAKING IT SLOW,
but SHE IS DEFINITY THE ONE.
Oh, MY GOODNESS. WELL, THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.
listen, UM,
a FRIEND OF MINE IS HAVING A BARBECUE FOR HER HUSBAND ON SATURDAY,
and I THINK YOU SHOULD COME.
Really?
Yes, AND BRING GINGER.
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CAN MAKE IT.
well, YOU HAVE TO BRING GINGER,
because IF REX SEES THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER,
then HE'LL RELAX.
Oh. UH...
okay.
son OF A BITCH!
you ARE OUT OF TOILET PAPER.
Bree, I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
Hey, HONEY?
are YOU HOME?
three MONTHS?
God, YOU
you SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME.
were YOU EVER GOING TO TELL ME?
I WANTED TO,
but I KEEP PUTTING IT OFF.
I KNEW HOW YOU'D REACT.
Congratulations. YOU READ ME LIKE A BOOK.
why WOULD YOU HIRE THAT WOMAN?
look, TECHNICALLY, PETERSON FOUND HER.
I JUST VOUCHED FOR HER.
come ON, HONEY, I'M JUST HELPING HER OUT.
it's THE LEAST I CAN DO.
look, SHE WAS DEVASTATED WHEN I LEFT HER FOR YOU.
I FELT BAD.
do YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER?
all RIGHT, I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.
come ON, YOU CAN TELL ME.
you STILL CARE ABOUT HER, DON'T YOU,
just A TEENY, TINY LITTLE BIT.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE A GOOD GUY.
that's ALL.
well, YOU CAN'T WORK WITH HER.
what DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, QUIT?
talk TO PETERSON.
maybe HE CAN GET HER TRANSFERRED.
I MEAN, WEREN'T YOU GUYS PLANNING ON STARTING SOMETHING UP IN BELIZE?
honey, YOU'RE CRAZY.
no, I'M SERIOUS.
if SHE STAYS, I WILL HAUNT YOUR OFFICE.
I'll BRING YOU LUNCH EVERY DAY.
I'll BRING THE KIDS TO VISIT.
I WILL CHANGE DIAPERS ON YOUR DESK.
every BIRTHDAY CAKE IN THE BREAK ROOM,
every RETIREMENT PARTY,
I WILL BE THERE...
watching HER.
well, I BETTER GET YOU A PARKING SPACE, 'CAUSE SHE'S STAYING.
don't YOU THINK IT SPICES UP THE ROOM?
Oh, I WAS JUST LEAVING YOU A GIFT
to APOLOGIZE FOR, YOU KNOW, THROWING GRAVEL IN YOUR FACE.
well, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
no, I KIND OF DID.
see, I WANT US TO BE FRIENDS.
Yeah, WELL...
that's NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
why NOT?
aside FROM YOU BLINDING ME?
you KNOW, SEVERAL WEEKS AGO,
you FREAKED OUT IN MY HOUSE.
you SCREAMED, YOU THREW FURNITURE AROUND.
okay, WELL, I REALIZE THAT I WAS OUT OF LINE THAT NIGHT,
but I WAS UPSET.
and WE HAVE TO GET OVER THAT
for JULIE'S SAKE.
for JULIE'S SAKE?
how DO YOU THINK IT MAKES HER FEEL THAT HER MOTHER AND HER BOYFRIEND CAN'T EVEN GET ALONG?
Hey, ZACH,
Julie DOES NOT THINK OF YOU AS HER BOYFRIEND.
in FACT...
I DON'T THINK SHE WANTS ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU.
she SAID THAT?
Yeah.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
believe WHATEVER YOU WANT.
well, IF SHE DID, IT'S BECAUSE YOU TELL HER STUFF ABOUT ME THAT'S NOT TRUE.
Zach! COME HERE!
right NOW!
please DON'T RUIN THIS FOR ME.
how DO YOU KNOW MARY ALICE?
who?
she LIVES NEXT DOOR TO ME IN FAIRVIEW.
she's STANDING RIGHT HERE IN THIS PICTURE WITH YOU.
that's ANGELA FORREST.
we WORKED TOGETHER AT THE REHAB CENTER 15 YEARS AGO.
don't BE DENSE, FELICIA.
don't YOU THINK I KNOW MY OWN NEIGHBOR?
does THIS MARY ALICE HAVE CHILDREN?
a TEENAGER -- A BOY.
what?
angela AND I WORKED TOGETHER WITH A VERY DISTURBED YOUNG WOMAN
who GAVE BIRTH TO A BABY BOY.
about A YEAR LATER,
angela AND HER HUSBAND...
disappeared.
not LONG AFTER THAT,
I HEARD THAT THE CHILD WAS MISSING, TOO.
people SAID IT WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE,
but IN MY HEART,
I ALWAYS HOPED THAT SHE HAD GIVEN HIM A PROPER HOME.
are YOU SAYING SHE STOLE THE BABY?
don't LOOK SHOCKED, MARTHA.
it MAKES YOUR FACE LOOK FAT.
the BIOLOGICAL MOTHER WAS A DRUG ADDICT.
if ANGELA REALLY IS YOUR NEIGHBOR,
which I DOUBT,
then THAT CHILD WAS VERY LUCKY.
Lynette, HEY.
Oh, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TOM, HE'S OUT WITH A CLIENT.
no, I ACTUALLY WANTED TO SEE YOU.
you KNOW, THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING.
I've BEEN HERE ALL THIS TIME.
we SHOULD GO OUT
for LUNCH, JUST THE TWO OF US.
Yeah, I'LL CHECK MY BOOK.
so, ANNABEL...
do YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR TOM?
what?
you HEARD ME.
okay, YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS, LYNETTE?
let's TALK.
Yes, TOM AND I WERE IN LOVE,
but HE MARRIED YOU.
I'm NOT LOOKING TO BREAK UP A HAPPY COUPLE.
anyway, THAT'S REALLY MORE YOUR SPEED, ISN'T IT?
morning, LADIES.
just COMING IN FOR A LITTLE MORE FUEL.
Yep, ONE MAN'S SLUDGE IS ANOTHER MAN'S LIQUID GOLD.
well, BACK TO THE TRENCHES.
watch YOUR STEP.
Tom AND I, WE'RE A TEAM.
our MARRIAGE IS ROCK SOLID.
nothing YOU DO COULD EVER BREAK THAT UP.
then WHY ARE YOU DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW
warning ME?
Gabrielle. WHAT BRINGS YOU DOWN HERE?
Oh, SWEET MOTHER OF GOD,
what HAVE YOU DONE THIS TIME?
you're PREGNANT?
Yes, AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I AM ON THE PILL.
which I KNOW YOU PROBABLY THINK IS A SIN, BUT IT WORKS.
it's A 99. 9% EFFECTIVE SIN.
well, MAYBE IT'S IN THAT 1/10th OF A PERCENT THAT GOD RESIDES.
couldn't WAIT TO THROW THAT IN, COULD YOU?
look, GOD IS SCREWING WITH ME.
he DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE,
so HE'S PUNISHING ME.
well, HAVE YOU DONE SOMETHING THAT WOULD WARRANT BEING PUNISHED?
the GARDENER?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS OVER.
well, IT WAS, AND THEN -- AND
well, YOU JUST HAD TO BE THERE.
look, THAT'S MY POINT IS I'D BE AN AWFUL MOTHER.
I'm SELFISH, AND I'M SELF-CENTERED,
and THE ONLY PERSON MORE SELF-CENTERED THAN ME IS CARLOS.
I MEAN, HE'S SO SELF-CENTERED
that HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW SELF-CENTERED I AM.
we'd BE TERRIBLE PARENTS.
Gabrielle, I'D LIKE TO HELP,
but I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT IT IS YOU WANT.
you KNOW, IT'S JUST
I WANT TO KNOW WHO TO BE ANGRY AT.
here's A THOUGHT. DON'T BE ARY.
be THANKFUL.
children ARE A GIFT, ARE THEY NOT?
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS CRAP.
I HAVE A PARTY TO PLAN.
Thanks.
Edie. HEY. - HI.
wow, THINGS ARE REALLY COMING ALONG.
Yeah, SLOWLY AND EXPENSIVELY.
well, IT'LL BE WORTH IT.
you're DOING AN AMAZING JOB.
so, LOOK, YOU'RE BASICALLY A PREDATOR,
and I-I NEED SOME ADVICE.
and I KNOW TOM LOVES ME,
but I DON'T TRUST THIS WOMAN.
I THINK THERE'S AN AGENDA THERE.
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I'M BEING PARANOID.
no, NO.
you DID THE RIGHT THING COMING TO ME.
there ARE TWO WAYS TO APPROACH THIS.
well, FIRST I HAVE TO ASK
what KIND OF SHAPE IS THIS WOMAN IN?
fantastic SHAPE. SHE'S GORGEOUS.
okay, NOW THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY TO APPROACH THIS.
you're GOING TO HAVE TO ACT FAST.
I'm -- I'M LISTENING.
well, IT'S REALLY PRETTY SPLE.
wh I FEEL THREATENED BY A WOMAN,
I PULL HER IN.
I MAKE HER MY BEST FRIEND.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEMALE FRIENDS.
I DON'T.
and I'VE NEVER FELT THREATENED BY ANOTHER WOMAN, EITHER.
but THE POINT IS
keep YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE...
keep YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER.
Tom, WE'RE HAVING A DINNER PARTY.
I'm THINKING OF INVITING ANNABEL.
we're NOT MOVING.
Susan KNOWS SOMETHING.
Edie SAID SHE FOUND -- - I DON'T CARE WHAT EDIE BRITT SAID.
I'm NOT LEAVING JULIE.
you WANT TO RISK OUR LIVES, OUR FUTURE,
over SOME SCHOOLYARD CRUSH?
it IS MORE THAN THAT. JULIE LOVES ME.
then WHY DOES SHE REFUSE TO SEE YOU?
Mrs. MAYER LIES TO HER.
if IT WASN'T FOR THAT, SHE WOULD BE WITH ME.
are YOU SURE?
you KNOW, JULIE'S A VERY SPECIAL GIRL.
I KNOW.
she COULD HAVE JUST ABOUT ANY BOY SHE WANTED.
I THINK YOU'RE AONDERFUL KID,
I DO, BUT...
you're NOT THAT SPECIAL, ZACH.
not REALLY.
but SHE KISSED ME.
lately?
let's JUST PACK OUR BAGS AND GET OUT OF HER
we CAN LEAVE THIS WHOLE MESS BEHIND. WE CAN START OVER.
and THERE WILL BE OTHER GIRLS, I PROMISE.
no.
if SUSAN GOES TO THE POLICE, IT'S OVER.
they'll TAKE ME AWAY.
they'll TAKE YOU AWAY. DON'T YOU GET THAT?
if JULIE DOESN'T LOVE ME ANYMORE,
then IT DOESN'T MATTER.
none OF IT MATTERS.
McGRUDER HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON.
during THE ENTIRE SHIP FOR THE PHASER CAMPAIGN,
he WAS PRACTICALLY HOLDING BENSON'S HAND.
after THE WAY THAT BURNHAM SCREWED HIM OVER, - I'D BE NERVOUS, TOO. MY GOD. - IT WAS AWFUL.
excuse ME.
I NEED TO GET IN HERE SO I CAN CLEAR THE PLATES.
Hey, HONEY, YOU WANT SOME HELP WITH THAT?
I'm GOOD.
looks LIKE WE GOT COMPANY.
Hey, GUYS, ISN'T IT TIME FOR BED?
Oh, THEY NEVER GET TO E YOU. LET THEM STAY UP FOR A WHILE.
okay, COME HERE.
come HERE. I WANT YOU TO MEET SOMEONE.
this IS MS. FOSTER.
Hi.
she's AN OLD, OLD FRIEND OF YOUR DADDY'S.
Hey, WHAT YOU GOT THERE?
it's A PICTURE WE PAINTED.
Oh, LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT THAT.
it's ALL OF US WITH MOMMY AND DADDY.
we're REALLY HAPPY.
Oh, THAT IS SO ADORABLE.
when DID YOU DO THIS?
today. MOM TOLD US TO.
I JUST TOLD THEM TO PAINT SOMETHING NICE.
the SENTIMENT'S ALL THEIRS.
but YOU TOLD US TO. - HOLD ON, HONEY.
grownups ARE TALKING.
well, THIS IS REALLY NEAT.
Hey, HOW WOULD YOU BOYS LIKE TO PAINT MY PORTRAIT ONE DAY?
sure. YOU'RE PRETTY.
so LIKE YOUR DAD SAID, IT'S TIME FOR BED.
I'll TAKE THEM BACK UPSTAIRS.
come ON, GUYS.
thank YOU.
I'm GOING TO BEAT YOU. HERE WE GO.
I MUST SAY, LYNETTE,
your HOME IS WARM AND INVITING,
your CHILDREN ARE ABSOLUTELY PRECIOUS
this WHOLE EVENING WAS PRACTICALLY A COMMERCIAL FOR THE PERFECT FAMILY.
you THINK?
you COULDN'T HAVE PLANNED IT ANY BETTER.
and I MEAN THAT.
good.
Hello, SUSAN.
Paul. HI.
I UNDERSTAND YOU AND EDIE WENT SNOOPING THROUGH MY HOUSE.
huh?
it's OKAY. I'M NOT MAD.
so...
what DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ANGELA?
it WAS MARY ALICE'S BIRTH NAME.
she WAS NAMED AFTER HER AUNT ANGELA.
when SHE WAS A TEENAGER, THEY HAD A FALNG OUT,
so SHE CHANGED HER NAME TO MARY ALICE.
this IS BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED,
so YOU'LL FORGIVE ME IF I'M HAZY ON THE DETAILS.
that's IT?
that's THE EXPLANATION?
ridiculously SIMPLE, ISN'T IT?
she CHANGED HER NAME
because SHE GOT IN A FIGHT WITH HER AUNT?
Paul, THAT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING MARY ALICE WOULD DO.
neither DID SUICIDE,
but WE BOTH KNOW THAT SHE DID IT.
so CAN WE FINALLY PUT THIS BEHIND US,
or DO YOU NEED TO BREAK INTO MY HOME FOR ANYTHING ELSE?
no. UM...
I'm GOOD. THANKS.
although IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND,
I'd REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT VIDEOTAPE I FOUND
the ONE MARKED "ANGELA."
it'd BE NICE TO SEE MARY ALICE WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG.
I'm AFRAID THAT BOX OF TAPES WAS THROWN OUT WITH THE TRASH.
okay, THEN.
Susan. I'M SERIOUS WHEN I SAY
I HOPE YOU'LL LEAVE MY FAMILY ALONE NOW.
this ENDLESS SUSCION OF YOURS HAS BECOME VERY TIRING.
Yeah, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.
Oh, THAT'S MY CELL. SORRY.
Oh, GOD, IT'S PETERSON.
excuse ME. - PETERSON?
Hello? YEAH.
so THIS IS QUITE A SHOW YOU PUT ON TONIGHT.
show.
the BOYS' PAINTINGS,
all THOSE REFERENCES TO HOW HAPPY WE ARE.
what's WRONG WITH SUBTLY REMINDING ANNABEL THAT YOU'RE HAPPILY MARRIED?
because IT WASN'T SUBTLE,
and IT'S AN INSULT TO ME.
I DID NOT MEAN IT THAT WAY.
are YOU SO INSECURE THAT YOU HAVE TO PULL THAT CRAP?
keep YOUR VOICE DOWN.
it DOESN'T MATTER IF SHE HAS FEELINGS FOR ME
as LONG I AM NOT INTERESTED.
have I EVER, EVER GIVEN YOU ANY REASON TO DOUBT ME?
anyone IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.
the FIRST TIME WE EVER MET, YOU WERE CHEATG.
with YOU. CHEATING WITH YOU.
it's A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR.
Oh, GIVE ME A BREAK.
well, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
you HIRE YOUR OLD GIRLFRIEND,
and YOU DON'T TELL ME ABOUT IT FOR THREE MONTHS?
I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU FROM DAY ONE,
and YOU WOULD STILL BE JUMPING DOWN MY THROAT.
no, ANNABEL IS ANCIENT HISTORY.
she's IN THE NEXT ROOM.
how LONG DO WE HAVE TO BE MARRIED, LYNETTE?
how LONG UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY TRUST ME?
I TRUST YOU.
how MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SAID TO ME, "IF YOU EVER TOUCH ANOTHER WOMAN, "I WILL TAKE THE BOYS, AND I WI WALK OUT OF HERE,
and YOU WILL NEVER SEE US AGAIN"?
well, THAT'S JUST...
something WIVES SAY TO THEIR HUSBANDS.
not ALL WIVES.
God, LYNETTE, YOU'RE JUST SO CONVINCED THAT I'M GOING TO BE UNFAITHFUL.
it -- IT MAKES ME SI
the DISTRUST, THE PARANOIA. YOU KNOW
no, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY
until YOU DRIVE ME OUT OF THIS MARRIAGE
just TO PROVE YOURSELF RIGHT.
okay, WAIT. FORGET I SAID THAT.
it's TOO LATE.
you SAID IT.
well, THEN, JUST CONSIDER IT SOMETHING THAT HUSBANDS SAY TO THEIR WIVES.
well, PETERSON'S ON CLOUD NINE.
he DISCOVERED SOME INSIDE SCOOP ON THE METRO ACCOUNT.
the BAD NEWS IS
we're GOING TO HAVE TO REDO THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION.
tonight?
they NEED IT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
peterson SAYS WE MIGHT BE PULLING AN ALL-NIGHTER.
well, I CAN'T DRIVE. I'VE BEEN DRINKING.
I'll DRIVE. COME ON.
Thanks. - DON'T WORRY, LYNTE.
I'll DELIVER HIM BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS I CAN.
please DO.
honey, TAKE OVER FOR ME. I'M GIVING A SPEECH.
just MAKE SURE THEY STAY PINK LIKE THAT, OKAY?
are YOU OKAY?
Oh.
Yeah, I JUST, UH...
realized HOW DISGUSTING MEAT COULD BE.
everyone...
I JUST WANTED TO SAY IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT ALL OF YOU CAME,
and AS YOU KNOW,
in A FEW DAYS,
I WILL BE KING A LITTLE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED VACATION.
lucky FOR ME,
breakfast IS INCLUDED.
Oh, GOD.
the BOTTOM LINE IS
I'm GOING AWAY TO JAIL,
and WHEN A MAN GOES AWAY TO JAIL,
which I HOPE NONE OF YOU HERE EVER HAVE TO DO,
he SEES WHO HIS REAL FRIENDS ARE.
so THANKS.
hear, HEAR.
excuse YOU.
stay PUT UNTIL I NEED YOU.
don't TALK TO ANYBODY,
and FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T GET DRUNK.
you KNOW, I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO MY COUSIN'S WEDDING TODAY.
it's NOT A WEDDING.
it's A COMMITMENT CEREMONY.
now SIT DOWN AND...
try TO FIT IN.
Ugh.
got YOU A HOT DOG.
no THANKS. I'M FULL.
there's A CROQUET SET.
do YOU WANT TO GO HIT SOME BALLS?
no.
well, THAT'S FINE.
we CAN JUST SIT HERE.
Zach, I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
I DON'T WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.
I JUST WANT YOU TO LEAVE ME ALONE, OKAY?
okay.
in THAT MOMENT,
while LOOKING AT THE PILLS THAT HAD BEEN SO OBVIOUSLY TAMPERED WITH,
Gabrielle's NAUSEA WAS SUDDENLY REPLACED BY AN EVEN STRONGER SENSATION
rage.
what ARE YOU DOING?
I'm SO SORRY.
that WAS AN ACCIDENT.
answer MY QUESTION.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS INVITED.
by WHO?
you KNOW WHAT, DR. VAN DE KAMP?
I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO ANSWER TO YOU.
see, I THINK YOU DO.
what IS GOING ON HERE?
he CRASHED THE PARTY.
this GUY CLEARLY IS NOT TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER.
it's OKAY.
george HAS A GIRLFRIEND.
you BROUGHT HER, DIDN'T YOU?
he DOESN'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. - I DO SO.
she's RIGHT OVER THERE.
that's HIS GIRLFRIEND?
see? WE WERE WORRIED FOR NOTHING.
so ANY TIME YOU WANT TO APOLOGIZE...
Oh, COME ON, REX.
you OWE GEORGE SOME SORT OF GESTURE.
Oh, WHAT THE HELL?
ha HA HA HA HA.
Rex, HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?! - TO BE FAIR,
I ONLY PUSHED HIM.
Carlos, YOU SON OF A BITCH.
I AM PREGNANT, ANIT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!
Wow.
this IS TURNING INTO ONE HELL OF A PARTY.
are YOU OKAY?
I THINK I CAN HONESTLY SAY NO, I'M NOT.
I'm SO SORRY.
Thanks.
but YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT KIDS
that YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING THEM UNTIL YOU DO,
and THEN YOU CAN'T IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT THEM.
it's TRUE.
all I'M SAYING IS MAYBE THIS IS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE.
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE FATHER IS.
what? - YEAH.
so YOU MEAN YOU AND JOHN HAVE STILL BEEN... - YEAH.
Oh, I KNOW, SUSAN, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
Aah!
Oh -- OH, OH, MY GOD!
Oh, MY GOD, THAT'S --THAT'S MY HOUSE!
I'll CALL 911! - YES, THAT'S
that's -- THAT'S MY HOUSE! OH!
Oh, MY -- OH, MY -- LOOK, MY KITCHEN!
Oh, IT'S A BIG FIRE!
turns OUT SOMEONE LEFT THE GAS ON WITH CANDLES BURNING.
that's NOT POSSIBLE.
we DON'T BURN CANDLES DURING THE DAY.
uh, WELL, I DID HAVE A-A FRENCH VANILLA CANDLE BURNING EARLIER, BUT --BUT I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
I-I BLEW IT OUT.
you're ALMOST POSITIVE?
Yes. I DID.
I-I DID, I-I THINK.
look, YOU'RE LUCKY THE FIRE WAS CONTAINED.
the DAMAGE COULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE EXTENSIVE.
you've GOT TO BE MORE CAREFUL FROM NOW ON.
???
Bree, HI. - HI.
you LEFT THE PARTY SO QUICKLY,
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU FOR WHAT REX DID.
Oh, GEORGE, I'M SO SORRY
he HUMILIATED YOU IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOT INTO HIM.
isn't IT OBVIOUS? HE HATES ME.
no, HE DOESN'T HATE YOU.
he DOESN'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
and YOU DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW HIM.
well, I KNOW THIS MUCH
he's NOT GOING TO LET US BE FRIENDS.
well, THAT'S NOT HIS CHOICE TO MAKE.
what IF HE ASKED YOU NOT TO SEE ME ANYMORE?
what IF HE ORDERS YOU NOT TO?
well...
I DECIDE WHO I NEED IN MY LIFE,
and I'VE DECIDED THAT I NEED YOU,
and THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.
he COULD MAKE IT AWFULLY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO SPEND TIME WITH ME.
well...
who SAYS HE HAS TO KNOW HOW I SPEND MY FREE TIME?
I'm HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE FAMILY ACROSS THE STREET.
I THINK ONE OF THEM MAY HAVE SET A FIRE IN MY HOUSE,
and I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT...
I FEEL LIKE IT'S GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY FRIEND WHO KILLED HERSELF.
I CALLED THE POLICE,
but THEY DIDN'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.
this FAMILY'S GOT A SECRET -- A BAD SECRET.
I THINK I'M IN OVER MY HEAD.
I NEED YOU TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT PAUL YOUNG AND HIS FAMILY.
do YOU THINK YOU CAN HELP ME?
as A MATTER OF FACT...
I KNOW I CAN.
spring COMES EVERY YEAR TO WISTERIA LANE,
but NOT EVERYONE REMEMBERS TO STOP AND SMELL THE FLOWERS.
some ARE TOO BUSY WORRYING ABOUT THE FUTURE...
or MISTAKES THEY'VE MADE IN THE PAST.
others ARE PREOCCUPIED WITH NOT GETTING CAUGHT.
it's A WINDOW.
or THINKING OF WAYS TO CATCH SOMEONE ELSE.
still, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A FEW
who REMEMBER TO TAKE A MOMENT
and APPRECIATE WHAT SPRING HAS GIVEN THEM...
just AS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE
who PREFER TO SIT IN THE DARK
did you leave the door open? Call the police!
is that the guy who broke into your house?
arrests were made...
Yeah, that's him.
I just want a chance
I don't want to know you.
fathers were confronted...
who's sister Mary Bernard?
you do not want to start a war with me.
bring it on.
boundaries were drawn...
Mr. Williams was responsible for your husband's death.
and everyone learned that sometimes justice is served...
we need to call an ambulance.
without sang a word.
there were many ways to tell Bree Van De Kamp was a lady.
thank you very much.
she was courteous to those around her, she moved with elegance and grace and she was very careful to never let others know what she was thinking.
Mrs. Van De Kamp, thank you for coming on such short notice.
so what's happened?
have you had any luck finding George?
you see, like most well-bred women...
george is dead.
he committed suicide last night at a hotel.
Bree had something to hide.
Oh, um...
well, um, it was very good of you to tell me in person, truly.
actually, uh, there's more.
more?
do you recognize this?
those are my panties. How did you...
we assume Mr. Williams stole them.
where did you find them?
Mr. Williams had a room filled with, um... unsavory items.
it was like a shrine.
unsavory items? Well, what does that mean?
you don't want to know.
just so you're aware, the daily tribuneis is starting to sniff around this story.
the editor's a good friend of mine.
I'm pretty sure I can quash it, but you might want to tell your family what's going on, just in case.
what is that?
I am so sorry. You weren't supposed to see that.
Mudge, get that out of here.
no, wait! Is that supposed to be me?
well...
it's hard to say.
I don't understand.
I mean, what would George be doing with a life-size doll?
Oh, dear lord.
go ahead.
Oh, hold it. What are you gonna do with that?
well, until we close the file on Mr. Williams, she's considered evidence.
we'll have to take her back to the station.
I am so sorry about this, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
I know how difficult all this must be.
don't you worry about me, Detective Barton.
I will be just fine.
Yes, there were many ways to tell that Bree was a lady, but the surest was to watch how she maintained her dignity in even the most undignified of situations.
it's a story as old as time itself...
the return of the prodigal son.
and no matter how many times it's repeated...
or how the details might vary...
or how the names might change...
the story always ends the same way...
in the tender embrace of a loving father.
Hi, dad.
Susan Mayer told me she gave you some money to go to Utah.
Yeah, I had no idea where to look for you, though, and the money started to run out, so I thought that maybe you'd come back here.
you're a smart kid.
can I ask you something?
of course. Anything.
well, when you left town, Mrs. Tillman said that my real mother was a junkie from Utah.
that's right.
so...
who's my dad?
I don't know. It could have been anyone.
thanks for the faucet. This leak is driving me crazy.
what do I owe you?
Oh, it's no rush. Just pay me when I install it.
Hey, there!
have you seen today's paper?
no, not yet.
Ohh. There's a follow-up on that guy you caught last week.
police seek help in identifying mystery vagrant.
they don't know the man's name yet?
they're not even sure that he knows how talk.
think they're going to hold him in the psych ward until they figure out who he is.
well, I will certainly rest easier knowing that he's not roaming around our neighborhood.
see you!
thanks again for the faucet.
sure.
what are we gonna do about Caleb?
obviously, we are going to go and get him.
where are my cuffs?
bottom drawer. Ah.
so when do I tell people you'll be back?
couple, maybe three days.
what the hell's this?
it's the ball gag. I thought you wanted it.
we do not recycle ball gags.
take a look at the teeth marks.
it's gross.
Hey, Monroe?
you sure you don't want any help?
the guy's dangerous.
he's a half-wit, Jerry.
if I can handle you, I can handle him.
so he poisoned Rex?
sweet, little George Williams.
well, it turns out he wasn't so sweet after all.
anyway, there's a chance that some of this may wind up in the paper, so I wanted you to hear it from me first.
Bree, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, like you haven't been through enough.
God, and he's our pharmacist.
it's enough to turn you holistic.
I know this sounds awful, but I'm kind of glad the guy's dead.
Oh, I hope that little creep suffered.
well, we'll never know.
that's Andrew back from camp Hennessey. I've got to go.
does he know yet?
he hasn't got a clue.
how do you think he's gonna react?
all right, what the hell is going on?
I know you didn't take me out of kid jail for my health.
I'll get back to you later.
so are the police sure?
Yeah. They found data in George's personal computer and also records at his pharmacy that pretty much proves that he was poisoning your father.
did they say why he killed him?
well, the detective seems to think he was trying to get your father out of the way so...
he could marry me.
honey, please use your coaster.
that's gonna leave a ring.
my father was murdered because of you, so as far as I'm concerned, you no longer get to tell me what to do.
Andrew, that is not fair.
you brought that psycho into our house!
you sat him down at our table.
just how fair do you expect me to be?
Andrew, George Williams fooled a lot of people.
Yeah, well, he didn't fool me.
Andrew, I'm not trying to minimize my part in this.
believe me, I hate myself for what's happened.
good. Now we have something in common.
Oh, by the way, I'm gonna call my friend Justin and have him come over and spend the night tonight.
Justin? Is he a friend of yours from school or church?
what kind of friend is he?
the real good kind.
Andrew, it is inappropriate of you to have somebody over.
you just got home.
like I said, you don't get to tell me what to do anymore.
you came.
did I have a choice?
well, sure.
because at the hospital, you sounded like you were fully prepared to blackmail me into having some kind of a relationship with you.
that was just the heat of the moment, and once you get to know me, you'll understand that I am not the kind of person who could ever, ever resort to blackmail.
well, I wish you'd made that clear in the hospital.
could have saved me a trip.
so are you coming in?
well, I got a lunch hour to kill.
that was my first Halloween. I was 2. What do you think I am?
I don't know.
Oh, come on, just guess. You can tell.
uh, a holess person?
no, Addison, I'm a chicken.
see? Those are feathers hanging aroud.
Oh. I thought that was supposed to be trash.
uh, look, are we done here?
you haven't even finished your coffee.
I got to get back to work.
Oh, well, we... we haven't even finished the high school years.
I wanted to show you this one.
this was from the father-daughter dance.
I had to take my mother's hairstylist.
what do you want from me, Susan?
well, l - I just want to share more than our D. N.A.
I... I wanted to have a relationship with you.
none of this means anything to you?
I'll take the hobo picture.
actually, it was... fine.
what's this?
our company insurance policy. You ever bother to read it?
I'm going to say no, but don't tell.
we have day care, Ed, day care.
do you realize that since we fired half the staff, you and I have barely left the building?
my kids are forgetting who I am.
I hear you. I have 17-month-old who I haven't actually seen awake in weeks.
see? All we need is a minimum participation of...16 kids.
my kids, your baby, Sally in accounting has three, that new guy in human resources has two and we hit the mother lode with the mormon reptionist.
she just popped out number 6. There. 16.
15. My wife won't do it.
well, maybe if I talk to her.
no, I'm telling you, this day care thing is a non-starter.
fran won't even let anyone else hold the baby.
well, she won't just take some time off for a couple of hours?
Lynette, if I hadn't cut that umbilical cord I swear they would still be attached.
but if you want to try...
more power to you.
you! What the hell did you do with my husband?!
please restrain yourself, Gabrielle.
you're in a house of god.
tell me where he is!
everywhere, of course.
not god, my husband.
Gaby, what are you doing here?
I was just about to ask you the same thing.
you were supposed to meet me at the spa.
I was just helping sister Mary with the mailings for the fund-raiser.
the church is about to send a relief team to Botswana to help with the drought.
that's your excuse?
we missed side-by-side water massages.
I had to book them weeks in advance.
okay, you missed a massage.
it's unfortunate, but there are people dying in Botswana.
there are going to be people dying in this church if you don't wipe that patronizing look off your face!
what is your problem?
sister Mary, will you excuse us, please?
certainly.
we are supposed to be working on our marriage, Carlos, but we can't do that as long as our lady of perpetual stick-up-her-butt has you worrying about thirsty orphans.
you're blaming sister Mary for the tension in our marriage?
she wants us fighting.
she wants you to get tired of me and walk out so she can have you all to herself.
that's crazy. She's a nun.
she may wear a habit and the beads, but at the end of the day, she is still a woman, just like me, and I know what I'm capable of.
she is a woman...
but she is nothing like you.
Carlos, where are you going?
you look tense, Gabrielle.
perhaps you should think about getting a massage.
Hi, Susan, it's Addison. Are you there?
Hi. Hi, yeah, I'm here.
good. You're home.
Uh-huh. What's up?
you know you were saying you wanted to be part of my life?
Yeah.
I'at the police station.
I need you to come bail me out.
solicitation? You were arrested for solicitation?
it was entrapment. I'm the victim here.
but you were with a prostitute.
apparently not.
I asked her three times... "are you a cop?"
they got to tell you, but she didn't say "boo."
I thought this was America!
Addison, you just got caught paying for sex.
now is not the time to wrap yourself in the flag.
don't give me that look. It wasn't my fault. I'm sorry.
how is trying to pick up a hooker not your fault?
I was at the store, I was working on my computer and then, you know, they have these ads?
they pop up on the screen and they ask if you want to have a hot date.
well, it gets a fellow worked up.
can't you just go home and have sex with your wife like a normal person?
she's a 68-year-old woman.
that bell stopped ringing for me years ago.
Oh, my god. Stop. Right now.
I'm gonna go pay this thing.
so am I off the hook now?
what?
th whole father-daughter thing, we're done, right?
thursday, coffee at 2. Be on time.
don't take this the wrong way, but are you dim?
okay, I didn't exactly love what I found out about you today, but the goal was to learn, not to judge.
I bring the coffee.
that crap you made burnt a hole in my stomach.
this is Tunde.
he lost both his parents to this drought.
in fact, water is always scarce in Botswana.
the national currency is called the pula or raindrop...
Hello, Gabrielle. What brings you here?
I'm concerned about the drought in Kenya.
botswana.
Yeah, and you?
well, I'm organizing this relief trip.
we leave in a week.
well, bon voyage, father.
I'm not going myself.
we had to scale back our relief efforts this year.
we even had to cut a few of the aid workers from the trip.
sister Mary, sister Greta were so disappointed.
if you just want to hand some of...
sister Mary was going on the trip?
well, sister Mary always goes for at least a few months, but when our funding came up short, she graciously offered to step aside, said there's plenty of god's work to do here.
thank you, Carlos. Appreciate it.
I bet she did.
how much cash are you short, father?
we plan to set up a modern system of irrigation.
I'm sorry to interrupt, sister Mary, but I have an announcement.
I have just received a donation of $8, 000, which means that sister Mary and sister Greta will be able to join our relief trip to Botswana.
it just goes to show angels are everywhere.
Hey. I'm here to see Lynette Scavo.
Oh, hi. Excuse me. Hi.
I'm Lynette. You must be Fran.
Hi. Ed said you needed to talk to me.
I couldn't imagine about what.
Oh, well, come on in my office.
you want me to put my daughter in day care?
but I'm a stay-at-home mom.
I'm not suggesting that you sign her up for all day.
maybe just a couple of hours in the afternoon.
wouldn't that be great?
have some time to yourself, relax, unwind?
I don't need to unwind. I love taking care of little Mindy.
Oh, of course, of course, but we all have days when we're starting to lose it.
wouldn't it be nice to have someplace to take her before you want to strangle her?
I cherish every moment I spend with her, truly.
Really?
Yeah. Look, I'm gonna level with you.
Parcher and Murphy can't have a day care center unless we have at least 16 kids and without little Mindy, we only have 15.
well, that's not my problem.
okay. Okay. I just thought I'd give it a shot.
well, I wish I could help you, but I can't.
okay.
Lynette, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
why did you have kids if you weren't gonna raise them?
excuse me?
well, I just don't understand women who say they want to be mothers, but then hand their kids over to glorified babysitters.
I work because my family needs me to.
Oh, dear, I've upset you, and that wasn't my intention.
I bet.
make no mistake, I'm a good mother.
that's the difference between us...
I couldn't settle for being a good mother.
I want to be a great one.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh, hi, Alberta. How are you?
were you the one that sent out those neighborhood watch pamphlets?
I was wondering if maybe you had any extra copies.
or I'll just borrow one from somebody else. Thanks.
Yep, looks like Carol's penmanship.
this is ridiculous. What does she think, we're having an affair?
well, she probably saw you drop me off yesterday, and she assumed the worst.
well, now you're gonna have to tell her the truth.
Oh, no, no, no. I'd catch holy hell.
Oh, so you want me to catch it for you?
I mean, you, yourself said she's crazy.
I don't want to wake up tomorrow morning and find my tires slashed.
all right. I'll talk to her.
Hello, Edie. Do you have something you'd like to say?
no. That pretty much says it all.
sister Mary, what a lovely surprise.
well, I couldn't leave without saying good-bye, Gabrielle.
Oh, that's so sweet. I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm sure not half as much as you're gonna miss your husband. Huh?
don't freak out. I'm going to Botswana.
What?! Sister mary needs a companion.
what happened to sister Greta?!
I was gonna go with sister Greta, but the region is so volatile, I decided I'd feel much safer with a male companion.
Carlos, you can't do this.
you can't just go to Africa.
honey, I'm only gonna be gone for two months.
this journey is important for me.
I want to be one of god's soldiers.
and you will be one, Carlos.
after you see the devastation over there, you're never the same.
you see how selfish your old life is and you just want to get rid of everything
Oh, gosh. I should get going and start packing.
we leave in less than a week.
I should probably send a thank you letter to my parole officer.
he's being a real mensch about this.
I may be a Catholic, but I am so not above slapping a nun.
go ahead.
do it.
just make sure you hit hard enough to leave a mark.
Yeah. I didn't think so.
kiss the kids good night and I'll see them in the morning. Okay, yeah.
I love you, too. Bye-bye.
I'm sorry about the day care thing, Lynette, but Fran hardly ever lets me hold the kid.
you know, since day one, all I ever got was, "support the head, support the head."
I think I know how to support a damn baby head.
Ohh, let's just... let's just do this.
I don't want to be here all night.
you're Mindy's father.
you have a right to spend time with her.
I know, but what can I do?
you could stand up to Fran.
if you don't, you'll just become more resentful, she'll get nuttier.
and without a father figure, poor Mindy will grow up to be stripper.
a stripper?
there's science to back that.
you know what?
you go ahead and push the button on this day care thing, Lynette, and count Mindy in.
Yeah, I'll handle Fran.
you're doing the right thing, Ed, for little Mindy.
Yeah.
dude, what if your mom walks in?
she won't.
you don't know that.
just wait till everybody's asleep.
seriously.
I'll make it worth your while.
you better.
I wish she would walk in on us, just to see the expression on her face.
God, I hate her so much.
still, though, she's your mother.
don't you sort of have to love her?
last year, when she found out that I like guys, she freaked out.
she said that if I didn't change, I'd be going straight to hell, so since I knew that I couldn't change, it suddenly hit me that one day, my own mother was gonna stop loving me, so I decided to stop loving her first.
that way, it wouldn't hurt so bad.
she didn't know what she was saying.
Yes, she did, so now she's got to be punished.
how are you gonna punish her?
one day, she'll slip up, and I'll have something against her and when that happens, I'm gonna take her down so hard, she'll never get back up.
it may take you awhile to get something on her.
that's okay.
I don't mind waiting for the things that I want.
Lynette, hey, hey. Look who's here.
Hey! You know, the day care room won't be ready until next week at the earliest.
if I had waited, I might have lost my nerve.
I had a window.
fran was in the shower, so I just grabbed the baby and ran.
you took the baby without telling Fran?
I refuse to be bullied by that woman. You were right.
Mindy is my daughter, I wanted to spend time with her.
I have that right.
um, Ed, the lobby just called and your wife's on her way up and she seems pretty angry.
Oh, man.
here. Hold Mindy. Oh.
let me handle this.
Oh, I was planning to.
I thought Mindy had been kidnapped!
I left a sticky note.
I wasn't looking for a sticky note, Ed!
I was looking for my missing child!
she's my child, too, and she's staying here, just a few hours a day.
you, give her to me.
no, I made a decision.
yeah? Okay, watch me make a decision.
I'm done with this marriage. I'm taking my baby and I'm getting on a plane to Pittsburgh.
you wouldn't dare!
you think you miss Mindy now, wait till we're living with my mother!
I'll fight you on this. Yeah? Try...
as Lynette saw her dreams of day care about to board a plane to Pittsburgh, a baby needs her mother! You're crazy, you know that?!
Yeah! I'm crazy to think...
she decided this flight would have to be grounded.
you don't scare me.
Oh. Oh!
what the hell is she doing?!
open up! Give me my baby!
good thinking, Lynette!
I am not on your side, Ed. You're not?
no, I am on Mindy's side.
she is the one caught in the middle, and I'm not letting you two have her until you calm down.
I want my damn child.
Lynette, I have Tom on line two.
pat, can you see here I'm holding a baby hostage?!
I will call back!
all right, that's it. I'm calling the police.
Oh, for god's sakes! Lynette's not going to hurt the baby!
no, and you're gonna get her back a whole lot faster if you will just listen to me, okay?
listen, and you? All right, good.
so first of all, Ed, stealing the baby was really stupid.
thank you. You're welcome.
you need to find a better way to communicate with your wife.
and, Fran, I know what the pressure of trying to be a super parent does to your head.
you can take a break and be a great mom.
doesn't this little sweetheart deserve a well-rested mommy?
well, I guess the pressure does get to me a little.
and it's okay to admit that.
this is communication. This is good.
why don't you guys go down to the lobby, talk it out over some coffee?
uh, what about Mindy?
we've got day care!
we've got day care. Hi. I called earlier from the spiritual outreach program?
Hi. Piano player, right?
this is so generous of you.
there it is. It's not exactly a concert grand.
I should warn you, on the whole, our patients are generally unresponsive, so I hope you don't expect a lot of clapping.
miss Delaney, I find when the spiritual rewards are this great, who needs applause?
excuse me.
did Addison talk to you about me?
Oh! I guess not.
he's a married man!
what's wrong with you?! No, wait! Wait!
it's not what you think!
he hasn't touched me for three years because of sluts like you!
Carol, if you would just stop throwing things at me, I'll explain!
how... how can you explain?! You're screwing my husband!
no, I'm not screwing him! He's my father!
I'm so sorry.
I thought you should know, but he didn't want to tell you.
I want to die.
Oh, no. I do.
Oh, Carol, you don't have to clean that up.
they have clerks for that.
how old are you?
we've been married 39 years.
it's been going on from the start.
believe me, I didn't want to hurt anyone.
I just wanted to find my dad.
I'm glad you did, but you be careful, sweetheart.
he's gonna break your heart.
Andrew, I made an appointment with a therapist for you, me and Danielle.
I don't think so.
this pain that you're feeling is completely natural, but it's not gonna go away until you deal with it.
Andrew, I want us to heal, I want us to be a family again.
you know what I want?
I want for George Williams to walk through that door so I can take a knife and plunge it into his heart.
I want the pharmacist to pay for what he did to my father.
well, the good news is he's... he's dead.
he committed suicide. His death was on his terms.
that's not justice.
so are you saying if he were executed that it would be easier for you to get past this？ Of course.
George... didn't intend to commit suicide.
he was trying to manipulate me into taking him back, and he swallowed those pills hoping that I'd feel sorry for him.
he just assumed that I would call an ambulance.
when I got there, he was already slipping away.
I tried to get him to accept responsibility for what he'd done...
but he wouldn't.
so what'd you do?
nothing.
I just sat there and let him die.
Oh my god.
he didn't die on his terms, Andrew.
he paid for what he did to your father.
thank you for telling me this.
Hey, how you doin'?
yeah?
Zach's come home.
what? Is he okay?
he's fine.
is there anything I can do?
thanks for asking you can leave us alone.
I spent a lot of time looking for Zach, and you know why.
maybe I'm not making myself clear.
you come near my son, I'll go to the police.
I'll tell them what happened out in that quarry.
you do that and we'll both go down.
well, you know I'm capable of almost anything.
Hey, I thought you'd like to know Zach and I are moving away.
I want to give my son a shot at a normal life.
I'm sure you'll agree it's for the best.
now see, this is where you and I don't see eye-to-eye.
for Zach's sake, I'll keep quiet, for now, but you're not taking him away.
if I see a "for sale" sign in front of that house, I'll call the police.
I'm capable of pretty much anything myself.
the doctor's going to give you a full work-up, then we'll start the inoculations.
make sure you fill out everything and the nurse will take you back. Thank you.
right.
Yes, right.
she has you flying halfway across the world to help the poor, and there's perfectly good poor right here.
for god's sakes, give a buck to a homeless guy it's not the same.
no, it's better because you can do it in the comfort of your own car.
the point is not to be comfortable, Gaby.
it's about easing pain and suffering.
look, I'm trying to be a better person here.
now you can either help me or you can get out of the way, but you can't stop me.
come with me, please.
finish that for me.
here.
he didn't fill out the allergy section.
honey, he's going to a remote village in Africa.
does it really matter that he's allergic to eggs?
actually, yes. Eggs are on the list.
he could have a severe reaction to the yellow fever vaccine, and he won't be getting out of bed, let alone leaving the country.
Really?
Oh, don't write that down.
I wasn't being specific. He's allergic to fish eggs.
fish eggs?
poor baby's gone his whole life without caviar.
now that's suffering.
all right, doc, give me all you got.
it's so hot in this village.
baby, that's the fever talking.
the doctor said you're having an allergic reaction, but you're gonna be fine, okay?
hold me.
Ohh, honey. I'm so sorry.
Ohh, maybe that stupid nun is right.
maybe I am trying to stop you from becoming a better person.
it's just that I love you the way you are...
greedy, selfish and insensitive.
I'm just scared if you're not those things anymore, you're gonna wake up one day and realize I still am, and then you won't want me.
I want you. Just hold me.
Ohh.
Ohh, Carlos.
hold me...
sister Mary.
painting in the rain? Is that smart?
well, let me see, painting in the rain or letting the whole world think I'm a whore?
I don't know. What do you think?
heard you ran into my wife.
Yep.
so?
so you are hereby released of any further obligation to be my dad.
okay.
just so you know, I'm not actually proud of what I've done, you know, my hobbies.
good for you. Bye.
I have done things I'm proud of.
I could give you five examples right now.
okay, maybe three.
you don't have to do this.
I was a volunteer fireman.
I put out fires, I got kittens out of trees, the whole nine yards.
sweet.
about 20 years ago, I started a foundation to protect wild horses.
I probably saved hundreds of them.
Really?
I'm full of surprises.
okay, one more.
I wasn't exactly thrilled when you walked back into my life.
now that I've met you, well, you gave me a third thing to be proud of.
that was a good one.
that's why I saved it for last.
I have to spend some time working on my marriage.
when that's all sorted out, maybe we could continue with the catching up?
I'll wait for your call.
the stories are as old as time itself...
the prodigal son who returns home to the father who forgives him...
the jealous wife who tricks the husband who trusts her...
the desperate mother who risks everything for the child who needs her and the faithless husband who hurts the wife who loves him so deeply.
why do we listen again and again?
because these are the stories of family, and once we look past the fighting, pain and the resentment, we occasionally like to remind ourselves...
Hi! Hi.
there is absolutely nothing more important.
you put my kids in danger, and then you lied about it.
do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?
Lynette asked a loaded question.
I'm the one who was sleeping with your son, but it's over now.
no, you're wrong. It's not even close to being over.
Gabrielle confessed...
here's your mail.
while Noah's search for Zach...
I worry for that boy.
what kind of people would buy a baby from a junkie?
played perfectly into Felicia's plot...
see that Paul Young has a toy chest of his very own.
for revenge.
what made my husband Paul Young such a good investor was his uncanny ability to anticipate the future...
Zach, how did you do this?
he foresaw the necessity of the velcro shoe.
he predicted the advent of the $3 cup of coffee.
he even anticipated the surprising boom in bottled water.
Yeah, it's Paul Young.
I've been reading about the election results in Brazil.
it's time to buy sugar.
but the crystal ball that served Paul so well in the stock market sometimes failed him closer to home.
paul Young? - Yeah.
detective sullivan.
you need to come downtown for questioning.
about what?
we're investigating reports of credit card fraud, and your name has been linked with several of the victims.
well, it must be some mistake.
could be.
but we still need to go downtown and straighten it out.
all right.
well...
how long is this gonna take?
don't worry about it. It's just a mix-up.
let's go.
what's going on? I thought you just wanted to ask me some questions.
that's after you're booked. Booked? - Booked for what?
you can't book him here anyhow, detective.
computers are down.
we're all full up.
you gotta take him down to county.
what is going on? This is crazy.
I wanna call my lawyer.
what the hell do you guys think you're doing anyway? Huh?
this is ridiculous.
I get a phone call!
Yes, in the world of investments, my husband had a remarkable ability to see the future.
got a message for you, Paul Young.
Dierdre's father said to give you his regards.
but sadly, Paul didn't see this one coming at all.
had a weekly routine she'd been following for years.
she cleaned on Tuesdays.
she paid her bills on Wednesdays.
she did her laundry on Thursdays.
and after these daily chores were completed, she would reward herself with a little drink.
what Bree didn't know was this latest addition to her routine had been noticed by her friends.
and it had now become part of their routine to discuss it.
so apparently Bree had a few too many and passed out.
next thing I know, I get a call at work
someone found my kids wandering the street.
Oh, my god!
have you seen Bree since?
no. I'm worried about her, but I don't know how I'm gonna get over what she did.
Hey, Bree.
how you doing today?
I'm really well.
um, I just saw you all talking before Lynette went off to work.
what were you all talking about?
Oh, nothing, really.
Carlos and I are gonna go see the adoption counselor today.
I'm checking myself into the hospital.
I'm finally gonna get that surgery.
Oh. Good for you.
did Lynette mention the little tiff we had?
just in passing.
she barely mentioned it.
because what happened was,
I accidentally mixed my antihistamine medication with, you know, a little glass of wine I was having, and I
I fell asleep, you know, while I was...
watching her kids.
I mean, I like a little wine with dinner,
I mean, now and then. You know, who doesn't?
but, uh, I mean, you know, to trash my entire reputation
Oh, Bree, she didn't trash you. Honest.
well, good. I mean, I just
I really wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression.
well, I'm--I'm going to the mall.
they're having a white sale today.
I think I'm gonna get a new bath mat.
Oh, does anyone need one?
no, I'm good. - Okay, take care.
wow, did you smell the alcohol on her breath?
I sure did.
then our eskimo turns in the camera and says, "polar fresh mints will give your breath an 'a'-plus, too.
so what do you think?
it feels a little familiar.
Really? I don't think so.
no, I'm pretty sure the lowell group used eskimos in a deodorant commercial they had last month. Remember?
Oh, this is completely different.
those were jock eskimos competing in the iditarod.
our eskimo's trying to, you know, patch things up with his wife.
Yeah. No, I get the subtle distinction.
I think we can do better.
okay? So, sally, you're up.
what do you got for me?
Hey.
Hey.
"I got the subtle distinction"?
what was that about?
if you really wanna do this now, shut the door.
okay, sure, I was a little bitchy.
but you know why? You did a half-ass job in there.
Hey, you may not like my idea, but you can't say I didn't work hard.
Oh, please.
I live with you.
last night, when you should've been trying to make that pitch work, you were watching the game.
I wasn't watching the game.
I saw you!
what, okay, now I can't check the score?
are you saying you gave your heart and soul to that eskimo pitch?
I worked really hard on that pitch.
did you give it 100%?
well, exactly. So? Big deal.
go work up some new ideas, and then we'll go over it during lunch.
okay?
you're the boss.
Yes, i am.
Hey.
good to see you again.
I'm really looking forward to your surgery.
and I'm really hoping you're a lefty.
Nope. I can't even write my name.
but that's what I get for throwing my kid a roller-skating party.
funny. So what about my surgery?
Oh, I'll still do it.
with Dr. Ron's help, of course.
Dr. Cunningham will be standing right beside me.
with my hands and his brain, you got the best parts of both of us.
then I'm on board.
we're keeping you under observation, so, hopefully, we'll operate tomorrow.
uh, if you don't mind,
I'd like a minute to consult with my patient.
Oh! Right, your, um, little thing.
what "little thing"?
um, well, it was--it was gonna be a surprise, but...
Oh, my god, they're beautiful.
um, look, I've been thinking about us a lot lately
about putting this operation behind us and where we'll go from there.
our future...
together.
and I really suck at putting my emotions into words, which is, um, it's why I wrote it all down.
there's a card.
Oh.
uh, but you can't read it.
not--not while I'm here anyway.
it's way, way too stressful.
um, I am going to go now.
Wow.
Wow.
Oh, he's so romantic.
may I?
Oh, it's sort of private.
well, I did help him pick out the flowers.
Oh. Um...
okay.
there's more on the back.
so how does this work?
do we flip through a catalog or something?
I wish it was that easy.
you have to understand, for every baby, there are ten couples who want it.
you don't choose your child. The birth mother chooses you.
Really?
so what do you think our chances are?
we will do anything that we need to do.
well, your typical birth mother is usually a young girl, and she'll just wanna make sure you're quality people.
now to show her that, you'll be putting together a parent portfolio.
what's that?
family pictures, character references, that kind of stuff.
so, um, we're auditioning to be parents?
I guess you could say that.
so just to be clear, some slutty cheerleader gets knocked up by the soccer coach behind the local gas 'n gulp, and she is going to make sure we're quality people?
you don't need to answer that.
you know, you don't have to hide it from me.
hmm?
drinking. It doesn't bother me.
Oh, I wasn't hiding anything.
I was simply...
enjoying the day.
what you want?
well, um, Mason was my ride to school.
and his dad's moving them to Tucson so...
Oh, well, if you need a ride to school, I'm happy to drive you.
no, that's not what I want. I want a car.
well, then I suggest you get a job.
why should I go work my ass off at some fast food place when I can already afford what I want?
Andrew, we're not touching your trust fund.
it's my money.- Not until you're 21.
and if I had my way, you wouldn't get your hands on it until you're 50.
I mean, we both know you're gonna waste every penny of it.
why are you being like this?
because, sweet heart, it is my job to teach you about responsibility, setting goals, delayed gratification.
what do you know about delayed gratification?
it's not even noon, yet you're already on your third glass of wine.
you know, on second thought, I won't be driving you to school.
the walk will do you good.
mom, I'm not kidding around.
I want my money.
the answer is no.
well, aren't we a mean old drunk?
whatever that was supposed to teach me, consider the lesson learned.
what are you doing here?
I'm just enjoying the silkysmooth moves of Dr. Ron.
or should I say,"Dr. Love"?
give me that. Aah!- This is my favorite
I can't wait to be in the operating room with you "so I can touch your heart, "because you've already touched mine so deeply.
okay, that part sounds better when you don't read it out loud.
and what are you doing reading it anyway?
those are Dr. Ron's private thoughts.
Yeah, I got that.
you know, I sense that he really likes you, Susie.
so?
so do you really like him?
of course I do.
he's smart and funny and kind.
