cdb has been stung by criticism from chinese politicians and the public over its investment in barclays bank last july.
cdb is at the heart of china's increasingly powerful global money machine.
cdb is becoming palpably more cautious.
cdb is the natural repository for banking assets, although china investment corporation may disagree.
cdb said that it would use its strengths in integrated financial services to help zte achieve its strategic goals, and drive zte's overseas investment and business development in priority sectors.
cdb was among the lenders that helped finance the growth of the domestic solar sector, lending companies billions of dollars to expand capacity.
cdb was rocked by scandal in early june when wang yi, the bank's deputy president, was detained for alleged financial crimes.
cdb will manage the new fund on a semi-commercial basis by taking equity and quasi-equity stakes in chinese firms doing business in africa.
cdb's demand inevitably raises worries about how u.s. know-how is being shipped westward.
cdc calculates that roughly 75% of the infected population comes from the baby boomer generation: 3.25% of people born in that "birth cohort" test positive for hcv, which is five times higher than adults born before 1945 or after 1965.
cdc director thomas frieden said consumers should throw out cantaloupes if they suspect they came from jensen farms.
cdc has developed a kit, explore the world with fruits and vegetables, for teachers, public health professionals, and dietitians to use with children to spark their interest in fruits and vegetables.
cdc issues yellow fever outbreak notice for brazil.
cdc laboratory work so far has established that the haitian cholera strain is one that's been identified in latin america, asia and africa.
cdc officials are urging high-risk adults to get vaccinations against both pneumonia and h1n1.
cdc officials have urged physicians in recent months to offer the vaccine to patients who qualify for it.
cdc officials said the h1n1 vaccine, which is still in development, appears to be a good match to the virus so far; the shot is currently in the human-testing phase but probably won't be available until mid-october at the earliest.
cdc officials said they do not believe that the pill, condoms and other forms of birth control were faulty. Instead, they think the teens failed to use it correctly or consistently.
cdc researchers write that "this is reasssuring at first glance," but add that it could be problematic because drinking water in 26 states has high perchlorate levels. So, mixing contaminated powdered milk with contaminated water in those places could result in a dangerous exposure.
cdc wants aids virus testing to be part of routine physical exams for adults and teens.
Cder encourages the applicant to contact the appropriate office or division if there is uncertainty whether the information should be submitted in an annual report or as a supplemental change to the approved application.
Cder requests that a current list of approved chemistry, manufacturing and control information be provided yearly in the annual report to better document the changes occurring in applications.
cdf I might provide direct imaging observation on the abnormal hemodynamics of f4 and has been important in the differential diagnosis.
cdh issued a letter saying that wang "is taking some time off and that both the venture and private equity fund were operating normally."
cdh manages over 5.5 billion u.s. dollars from more than 100 international and domestic institutional investors, including china' s national social security, according to information on the company' s website.
cdh owns a chunk of chery automobile, so it's a no-brainer: zhang will expand his fleet with locally made, lower-priced chery vehicles.

the imf said that while the markets seemed to have taken a positive view of the process so far, "some uncertainty regarding the stringency of the tests is likely to remain."

the imf's shift, from cheerleading for austerity to advocating a gentler approach, shows just how much old orthodoxies are crumbling in the face of the facts.
the imf's steven barnett and ray brooks calculate that in urban areas every extra yuan the government spends on health prompts an extra two yuan of consumer spending.
the imf's steven barnett and ray brooks calculate that in urban areas every extra yuan the government spends on health prompts an extra two yuan of consumer spending.
