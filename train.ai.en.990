hey you hear me talking to you?
I hear you. Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.
ever hear of a phone? Want to kiss my butt?
I'm not staying down here all day. Thank God.
Aw, man, shut up.
Molly!
I'm going to count to 3 and I'm out of here.
1, 2, 3.
no. Oda, wait. No.
it's Molly.
Molly?
I'm Oda Mae Brown.
I don't know you or Sam but let me tell you what he did.
he kept me up all night singing I'm Henry The Eighth I Am.
that's how he got me to go out with him.
look, I'm sorry. I just I just don't believe in this life after death stuff.
well, tell her she's wrong.
he says you're wrong.
you're talking to him right now?
he just asked me to tell you that you're wrong.
so where is he?
I can't see him. I can only hear him.
I'm right here.
that doesn't help, Sam.
I'm holding her hand.
he says he's holding your hand.
what are you doing? What do you think you're doing to me?
if you think I'm here for my health you're crazy.
Sam's dead, OK? He's dead.
tell her I love her.
he says he loves you.
Sam would never say that.
say ditto.
what the hell is ditto? Ditto!
to tell you the truth I don't know how I'm doing this.
confidentially, nothing like this has ever happened to me before.
I mean nothing. Now I can't turn it off.
is this him? Is this you?
Yeah. Yeah.
huh. Cute. White but cute.
what I don't understand is why did he come back?
I don't know.
why is he still here?
he's stuck that's what it is. He's in between worlds.
you know it happens sometimes that the spirit gets yanked out so quick that the essence still feels it has work to do.
would you stop rambling?
I'm just answering her question.
he's got an attitude now.
I don't have an attitude. Yes, you do have an attitude.
we're having a little discussion.
if you didn't have a attitude you wouldn't have raised your voice.
God damn it. Oda Mae
don't you god damn me. Don't you take the Lord's name in vain.
would you relax? You relax. You're the dead guy.
want me to help? You apologize.
Jesus Christ! I'm leaving.
nobody talks to me like that you understand?
now you better apologize.
I'm sorry. I apologize. OK?
now would you sit down? Please?
he's apologized.
I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying but you have to tell her word for word.
word for word. Yes.
he wants me to tell you what he's saying word for word.
Molly, you're in danger.
you can't just blurt it out like that.
and quit moving around, will you? You're making me dizzy.
I'll just tell her in my own way.
Molly, you in danger, girl.
what are you talking about?
I know the man who killed me.
he knows who killed him.
his name's Willy Lopez. I know where he lives.
he's a Puerto Rican Willy Lopez. He knows where he lives.
write it down.
you write it down. I ain't no damn secretary.
just do it!
he's so testy.
what is it you want me to write?
it's 303 Prospect Place apartment 4D.
303 Prospect Place? Yeah.
that's my neighborhood.
Molly, he's got my wallet he's got my key and he was in here.
he's got his wallet and key and was here.
yesterday after your walk with Carl you talked to Floyd took off your clothes
all right, all right.
when you came in after your walk with Carl he saw everything.
go to the police. It was a setup.
I was murdered.
he says go to the police. He was murdered.
there's somebody else involved
I don not know whom forget it...
I don't want no more to do with this.
wait where are you go? What do you mean where am I go? I'm leaving
I did everything I said I'd do. And don't be following me.
I'm finished. I mean it.
a nice life. Have a nice death. Goodbye.
Molly, there is no one on earth besides you who wants this to be true more than me but you got to be rational about this.
Sam is no more in this room than
look, I understand the need to hang on to him I really do but this is absurd.
I know this seems absurd but it had to be real.
you believed some fortuneteller from Brooklyn who shows up at your door?
I watched her have a conversation with him.
I don't buy it. Moll, not for a minute.
what about the things she knew?
what things?
the photo Sam took of me on our trip to Reno.
Carl, we were alone.
and the green underwear that I wrote my name in.
she said Sam knew who killed him.
Yeah, that he was set up.
this is getting deranged. We're off the deep end.
she had a name and an address
Willy Lopez.
303 Prospect Place apartment 4D.
this is sick.
Carl.
this is really sick.
God.
Molly, I don't understand how you could you could...
swallow this crap. I mean...this guy may not even exist.
maybe she's just trying to use you to set someone up.
you're right.
you're absolutely right.
that's what I got to find out.
what do you mean find out?
she said Sam wants me to go to the police.
Sam wants you to go to the police?
Jesus. Moll. Are you out of your mind?
what are you going to tell the police?
that some storefront psychic has been communing with the dead?
do you know what that sounds like?
you're talking ghosts here for Christ's sake.
I'm sorry. This stuff just really gets to me you know? It's OK if you don't believe me.
I'm trying to, Molly.
if it'll make you feel any better I'll go check this out, OK?
I want you to try and get some sleep.
all right.
I'll call you in the morning. OK.
good night
be careful.
Carl.
what the hell are you doing here?
who you been talking to, Willy?
talking to? What the hell do you mean?
some woman knows all about you everything.
Where's she getting it from?
I haven't said a word to anybody.
she knows your name and where you live.
a lot of women know where I live.
this is not a joke.
she knows about the murder.
I want you to find this bitch whoever she is and I want you to just get rid of her, OK?
I've got $4 million stuck in a god damn computer.
if I don't get those codes if that money is not transferred soon...
I'm...dead. We're both dead.
why not tell them you only launder money the first of the month?
what the hell is wrong with you? Is everything a joke?
you killed a man. You were supposed to steal his wallet.
was that a joke? I did you a favor. That was a freebie.
look, these are drug dealers, OK?
just don't blow this for me. I've risked my job. I could go to jail.
$80,000 of that money is mine.
look, just...let me have the key to Sam's apartment.
I'll get the address book myself, OK?
you god damn bastard!
Why? Why? You were my friend!
I had a life god damn you. I had a life!
look, I don't even believe in this stuff myself.
but she was real.
you think I'd come down here if it wasn't real?
you know you told me if I had any new information that I should come. So here I am.
I know how this sounds.
I hear myself saying it and I want to cringe.
but this woman knew things she couldn't have known.
things Sam only said to me.
OK, according to this psychic lady there are ghosts and spirits all over the place watching us all the time? Huh?
hell, I'm never going to get undressed again.
excuse me. I got more important things to do.
the guy's name is Willy Lopez.
all I'm asking you to do is check it out.
OK. Wait here. Let me see if the guy's got a record, all right?
great.
what are you doing?
Where's the file on Willy Lopez? There isn't one.
he was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with.
this psychic woman's got a record that goes back a long way.
1967 Shreveport forgery...
selling false I.D. served one year 1971
Baton Rouge arrested for fraud.
numbers racketeering served 10 months 1974.
look, this is impossible.
it goes on and on
she knew things, private things.
now how could she have known all that?
a lot of times they read the obits.
she just had to see the word "banker" boom.
hell, they even go through your...garbage to find things they can use letters old papers. It doesn't take much.
no. It was real.
she knew about a...a sweater I knitted.
and songs we sang. Our trip to Montego Bay.
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.
people want so much to believe.
they're grieving they're vulnerable...
and they will give anything for one last moment.
believe me. These people know what they're doing.
I know how you must feel but you know you can press charges.
no.
thank you.
God, let this be it.
Yes.
hello. Eddie? It's Carl Bruner.
what's up?
everything's fine. Just we're all set.
let me know what you want me to do.
want you to transfer the money from the 12 separate accounts into a single account under the name Rita Miller.
OK.
tomorrow at five minutes before closing 3: 55 p. m.
transfer the full account to the First Island Bank of Nassau registry number 4869580.
call us when it's done.
OK. I've got it.
just tell Mr. Balistrari that there won't be any more problems OK?
Yeah. I'll do that. Thank you.
good work, Carl.
Molly, why can't you hear me? I need you.
who is it? It's Carl, Molly.
no. Don't open it , Molly. He's a murderer.
Hi. I know it's late. I'm sorry to disturb you.
I've been thinking about you all day and I feel really lousy about what happened last night.
this supernatural thing just
don't worry about it. It's OK. No, it's not.
you needed me to hear you and I didn't.
I wasn't there for you and that was...that was wrong.
it's just I...
I just want you to know that I'm your friend.
Thanks, Carl.
you were never our friend.
that really means a lot to me. Me, too.
I brought you some Japanese apple pears. I know you like them.
Thanks. That's very sweet.
could I come in for a second?
it's just been one of those days.
maybe some coffee?
Yeah. Come on in.
no, Molly.
you seem a little tense. Are you OK?
no. I'm fine. It's just what can I tell you?
it's been tough. It just still hurts so much.
you lying snake.
and on top of it, it's stuff at work.
they've given me my own accounts which is good but I just haven't really had time to adjust kind of absorb everything.
it's no big deal.
Yeah. Can I have just a little more cream?
shit. Jesus. I can't believe I did that.
are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
let me throw that in the washer.
don't worry about it. It's OK. It's just...
you want another shirt? No. It'll dry. It'll just take a minute.
where were you today? I thought you were going to come into the bank and sign those papers?
I was supposed to but I didn't have time.
I went to the police.
you did? Wow. What did you tell them?
what did they say? It was awful.
I felt really stupid.
they brought out a file on this woman and
at least 10 inches thick.
a rip off artist, huh?
no, Molly.
you know the sad thing...is that I believed her.
Molly...
sometimes we need to believe.
Why? What's the point?
Molly, it's not easy to face the realities of life sometimes.
you got to give yourself that.
what you've got to remember is the love that you guys felt.
you got to remember how good Sam was.
you were everything to him Molly. You were his life.
I feel so alone.
you're not alone. OK?
you got your work. You're incredibly talented. You're young.
you're fantastically gorgeous.
I don't know what's real anymore.
I don't know what to think.
just think about Sam.
think about the time you guys had together.
how wonderful that was.
Yeah. Let your feelings out, Moll. It's OK.
life turns on a dime. You know?
I mean...people think that...
they're there forever that there's always going to be tomorrow but that's bull shit. Sam taught us that.
you have to live for now.
for today.
I can't. I'm sorry. It's OK.
I, I, I can't. It's just too soon. It's OK.
you've been great, Carl.
but I need you to leave. I understand totally.
please.
could we just have dinner tomorrow night? Just talk?
can I interest you in that?
Yeah. Sure. Great.
get off my train! No.
get off!
get off! Get off!
get off! Get out of here!
no. Show me how you do that. I'm not leaving till you teach me.
get off! No.
get off!
you stubborn asshole.
what are you doing? What the hell are you doing?
what am I doing?
you're trying to move it with your finger.
you can't push it. You're dead.
it's all in your mind.
the problem with you is you still think you're real.
you think you're wearing those clothes?
you think you're crouched on that floor?
bull shit!
you ain't got a body no more, son!
it's all up here! You want to move something you got to move it with your mind!
you got to focus! Do you understand?
how? How do you focus?
I don't know how you focus. You just focus.
how did you do that?
you got to take all your emotions all your anger all your love all your hate and push it way down into the pit of your stomach and let it explode like a reactor. Pow!
OK. OK.
don't laugh.
way to go, kid.
I did it. I did it.
way to go.
from your gut like I told you.
give it time. What else have you got?
how long have you been here?
since they pushed me.
someone pushed you? Yeah, someone pushed me.
who? You don't believe me?
you think I fell? You think I jumped? Fuck you!
it wasn't my time! I wasn't supposed to go!
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'd give anything for a drag.
just one drag.
are you all right?
who are you? Why are you hounding me?
who sent you?
who sent you?
leave me alone.
leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Yes! You need to concentrate 'cause if you concentrate you'll probably rouse him.
what's his name again? Orlando.
Orlando. Orlando. Is there an Orlando here?
I'm here.
he's here. Sam.
Oda Mae. Excuse me. I'm Orlando. The line's over there.
where did these ghosts come from?
you can hear them, too?
I hear them in the morning and the evening.
they're coming into the shower.
did you tell every spook you met about me?
I got spooks from Jersey coming in here.
there's stuff going on you wouldn't believe.
it's amazing. You're really doing it. I know.
can you hurry this up?
chill out. Chill out.
I need your help. There's something we need to do.
I'm not doing anything else with you, Sam.
you're holding on to a life that doesn't want you anymore.
it doesn't want you. Give up the ghost.
are you speaking to me?
does it look like it?
you're supposed to be concentrating, aren't you?
you going to try it?
thank you very much.
Sam, are you going to get out of here?
fine, then stay there.
excuse me. Excuse me. You ready now?
let's do it.
I got to talk to you now. I've got a plan.
all we got to do is we can...
Oda Mae?

orlando, you like it? It's autumn sunrise.
get out of me, you son of a bitch.
don't you ever do that to me again.
Orlando?
I can barely move.

are you deaf? I said everybody out!
everybody out! Get out! Get out!

Oda Mae! Sister! Sister!
I'm all right. I'm all right.
we're in trouble so you got to help.
what do you mean we? You're already dead.
these people are trying to kill me.
and they'll be back.
why don't you just find a house to haunt?
get some chains and rattle them or something.
I have a plan and it will work but get some of your fake I.D.s.
forget it.
if you do this, they'll never bother you again.
Scout's honor.
all right. What do I have to do? What exactly do I have to do?
you got a nice dress?
I don't see what's wrong with what I'm wearing.
sorry. I made a joke. I love your shoes.
I don't know anything about banking.
Oda Mae, would you just relax?
listen, I'm nervous.
I'll get you through it.
your fake driver's license is great.
Sam. I don't think I should do this.

I'm going to make my sister go to a fat farm.
I'm going to buy the building.
I've got an idea.
please donate.
take the check out of your purse.
right. I should put it where nobody can get it.
no. No. Endorse it.
if I endorse it then if I drop it somebody will get it.
I never said you were going to get the money.
it's blood money. I was killed for this money.
now endorse the check.
what are you going to do with it?
look over there. To your left.
you don't think I'm giving this $4 million
if you don't they'll track you down.
to a bunch of nuns. Get rid of it.
Sam, you're killing me! It's $4 million!
you'll go to heaven.
I don't want to go to heaven. I want to cash the check.
hello.
you'll thank me later.
how are you doing?
now, endorse it "Rita Miller." I know.

I'm proud of you, Oda Mae.
I don't care. Stay away from me from now on.

leave me alone. Never talk to me again.
I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae.
go ahead search. You'll never find it.
they're going to kill you, Carl.
you and Willy. You're going to be fertilizer.
they're going to bury you right next to Jimmy Hoffa.
who's doing that? Who's doing that?
I thought we were having dinner.
I know, Moll. I'm sorry. I just forgot.
had trouble at the bank.
forgot? I wish you'd called. I've been really worried.
listen, Molly. I got to ask you about something.
Yeah. He needs to borrow $4 million.
when you said that you thought Sam was here that he was talking to you what did he say to you?
what does that have to do with anything?
just listen to me.
this psychic lady, I want to know what she told you.
stop this.
it doesn't matter. It wasn't real.
what the hell happened to you tonight?
does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today?
the bank? Yeah. Ferguson said she closed an account.
her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown. It's Rita Miller or something.
Carl, are you all right?
it's just my stomach. It's...
Jesus.
do you have any like some Pepto Bismol or something? Cyanide...
Yeah. It's upstairs. Sit down. I'll get it.
what's wrong? Does little Carl have a tummy ache?
what are you doing?
now do you believe in ghosts?
I'll set the place on fire I swear to God.
I'll cut her throat.
Carl.
I swear to God. I'll cut her throat.
I need that money and I want it tonight at 11:00.
if that psychic does not bring it here Molly is dead. OK?
Carl, who are you talking to?
nothing. Now, Molly, listen to me.
I can't explain this now but there's a problem OK?
something at the bank.
Carl, you're scaring me. I'm sorry.
I'll come back about 11:00.
Why? Why not now? Molly look I'll come back.
like 11:00, OK?
Molly, but it's important. Got to go.

I'm calling the police.

he was murdered.
he found out Carl was laundering money at the bank.
this guy Carl is dangerous. He tried to kill me.
he's going to try to kill you too.
you're in deep trouble.
why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to me?
why are you doing this to me?
I can't... I just can't...
Oda Mae. Oda Mae, tell her...tell her she's wearing the shirt that I spilled the margarita on and the earrings I gave her for Christmas.
Sam says you're wearing the shirt he spilled the margarita on and the earrings he gave you for Christmas.

give me a penny. What?
push a penny under the door.
push a penny under the door?

Sam says it's for luck.
we're between Green and Mercer on Prince.
the gray building across from the post office.
Thanks, Sergeant. Please hurry.
we'll be waiting.
all right. They're on their way. Good.
so what do we do now? Just wait.
is Sam here?
Sam?
I'm sitting beside her.
he's sitting right beside you.
Sam, can you feel me?
with all my heart.
says with all his heart.
I'd give anything if I could just touch you once more.
he says he wishes he was alive again so he could touch you.
me, too.
OK. OK. Look.
you can use me.
use you? You can use my body.
use your body? Just do it quick before I change my mind.
Molly! Molly are you home?

Molly?

I'm going to miss you too Sam. You're all right.
Bye, Oda Mae.
Bye, Sam.
I love you, Molly.
I've always loved you.
ditto.
it's amazing, Molly.
the love inside...you take it with you.
see ya.
see ya.
Bye.
tell me. - It's a girl.
you disappear to Los Angeles. You don't return my calls,
I'm worried about you. We all are.
I know when a man is willing to sacrifice anything for his cause, and you're not that kind of man, Agent Benford.
I need a favor... a big favor.
it's for Tracy.
Hi, Dad.
what I saw, what you saw, doesn't have to play out that way.
al, what are you talking about?
I found a way to change the game.
dear Celia,
I don't know your last name, and I don't know where you live, but I know you have two young boys...
twins, I believe.
and I know you didn't have a flash-forward.
they all saw FBI Agent Al Gough alive and well on April 29th.
what this guy apparently was trying to show us is we can't take what we saw for granted.
okay, bottom line is, this is a new world.
this is a new day, and I just think we need to take a moment and let that sink in.
what we need to have answered right now is the question, is there going to be another world blackout?
people are terrified. - Let's get back to the big question.
what big question? Do we have free will?
that's the big question?
possibly the central question of human existence for millennia.
if this is supposed to be your resignation...
you can forget it.
you're not even gonna let me explain myself?
you were attacked. You were shot.
you returned to duty to find out a coworker jumped off a building
am I in the right ballpark here?
my life's not making a whole lot of sense right now, and I think I need a little time off to figure it out.
totally understandable.
but, uh, I need you here
I know we've been shorthanded since the blackout.
but ever since Gough...
since Al...
this isn't about Al. - Yes, it is.
when I found out about what he did and why he did it,
it just really made me think about my own future.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
do I lean into what I saw?
do I fight it?
what if my getting shot was...
I don't even know...
some... some sort of a sign that this baby's not meant to be?
you're gonna let a bullet decide whether or not you bring a baby into this world?
if Al's death proved anything, it's that our choices still matter, now more than ever.
well, I believe without reservation or recrimination that your card is the ace of spades.
well, that certainly answers that question.
I've been wondering how a Nobel Finalist and recipient of the Macarthur Prize spends his idle moments.
this isn't the time or the place, Simon.
you dropped off the radar, Lloyd.
without so much as a phone call,
I've had to check myself into the hospital to have my bruised ego X-rayed.
Hello, Dylan.
remember me?
why, this is not my pancake!
we're not having this discussion in front of my son.
Yeah, well, I'm done having you dictate when and where we talk.
Myhill forwarded me the e-mail you sent him.
or should I call it a suicide note? - It's the only logical move.
if you're hell-bent on self-destruction, then, yes, suppose it is.
but I still have doubts as to the cause of the blackout.
our experiment killed 20 million people, Simon.
20 million.
the world has been upended.
people need answers.
we have to go public and tell the world that we caused the blackout.
all right.
I guess we have to leave this room sometime.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
I have a reservation with the hotel that says different.
Oh.
plus you haven't opened your gift yet.
mm, what's this?
Oh...
just a little something to celebrate.
and what are we celebrating?
second chances, I guess...
and the fact that we can change the things we saw.
I never thought we couldn't, Mark.
it's the office.
I told them not to call unless it was an emergency.
I promise.
Yeah. - Hey, it's me.
this better be good, Dem.
Yeah, I'm sorry, man. Um, something came up.
did you bring your laptop? - Yeah.
I'm sending you some video we got from Barstow PD this morning.
remember when you had Marcie plug all the clues - off the Mosaic Board into NCIC? - You've got something?
Yeah. Barstow PD caught a homicide.
eyewitness managed to record it on her cell phone.
when it hit the system, NCIC kicked back a red flag.
Why?
stay tuned, man.
I'm headed back right now.
what do we have?
anything that might help us ID our tattooed friend? - Not really.
the victim, Neil Parofsky, is an aeronautics engineer.
who works out of a plant in Elsegundo.
watch and wallet were missing, so everybody's thinking robbery.
is that confirmed by whoever shot the cell phone video?
uh, Ingrid Alvarez.
Yeah, she saw Parofsky hand something over before he got shot, so she thought it was a mugging, too.
great.
first day back?
I should have gotten you flowers.
they're for your wife... - Oh.
for stitching me back together. And these are for you...
hard copy stills taken from that cell phone.
video forensics enhanced the images as best they could.
so now we just gotta figure out why someone would want to hit an engineer from Elsegundo.
have Vreede get into Parofsky's life...friends, family, bank accounts, whatever.
all right. What are we gonna do?
what was the name of that eyewitness? - Uh. Ingrid Alvarez.
we'll be talking to her.
if the guy in her video is one of the men I saw in my vision, this is our best lead so far... our only lead.
I'm putting him away now.
find out who sent him
and make sure he never shows up here on April 29th.
I'll sacrifice himself to prove we could change the future...
so let's change it.
Hey, honey.
everything okay?
Hey.
you're, uh, you're back early.
Yeah.
uh, Mark had a w... a work thing.
so what's going on here?
Oh, the usual.
you haven't been gone that long.
it's all right.
it's all right. It's all right.
it's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tracy... - I'm sorry.
it's pathetic waking up every damn morning like this.
maybe if you'd just talk about it...
I told you.
I don't want to talk about it.
well, I'm not giving you a choice anymore.
I've been grieving for you for two years, Trace.
hell, I even had... had your grave exhumed two months ago because I was convinced that you were... you were alive.
if you want to keep hiding out here...
if you want me to pretend to the world, your Mom included, that you're still dead, you have to tell me what happened.
after what I saw in my flash-forward,
I'd believe anything at this point.
listen to me, Trace. Four months from now,
I'm gonna be sitting by your side in Afghanistan.
you saw it, and I saw it.
isn't that why you came home?
obviously at some point,
I'm gonna get involved, wh-whatever it is.
so let's just cut to the chase and get started.
we can do this, Trac
how about the Simcoe boy?
he was supposed to be discharged while I was gone. - Not yet.
he was complaining of calf pain, so we removed the cast, did a doppler, - and the kid's got a DVT - You're kidding me.
man, I'm going to be a grandmother before this boy goes home.
I don't get it. Why are you so anxious to get rid of him?
is it his dad... Mr. Simcoe?
what makes you say that?
just that you guys have a weird relationship.
I mean, every time he comes around, you get crazy tense...
and... - Dr. Benford?
uh, actually, Dr. Varney just told me about Dylan's status.
uh, what exactly are the ramifications...
would it be safe to leave the boy's bedside for a while?
I see here that you have him on heparin.
now the risk of complications at that dose - is relatively minimal. Is that correct? - I'm sorry. And you are?
a good question. - I'm a friend of the family. Frankly, I was hoping to bring Lloyd away from the hospital for a while...
steak dinner, some fraternal martinis.
do you think you could see fit to sanction that?
I mean, the boy is essentially ready to be discharged, if I've read his chart correctly.
may I?
uh, yeah. Barring any complications,
I see no reason why Dylan couldn't go home - in the next couple of days. - Well, it's settled then.
Lloyd, you've been absolved of any guilt, parental or otherwise.
lovely.
thank you very much for your help. - Mm-hmm.
of course. Dr. Varley.
nice legs.
are you sleeping with that woman?
that is none of your concern, Simon.
everything you do is my concern now, since you pressed "send" on that idiotic e-mail of yours...
which brings me to the purpose of my visit.
I'm going public with or without Myhill's cooperation or yours. - Good luck getting anyone to believe you without it.
good luck stopping me. - Well, it appears we're an impasse.
there are two ways to settle this.
the first is, oh, so tawdry and public.
I make a general annoyance out of myself, - kick over as many anthills as possible... - Enough, Simon.
or we settle this in a more... civilized manner.
define "civilized"
do you remember how we settled whose name would go first on the application for the Sloan Fellowship?
Texas hold'em, no holds barred.
you win, we go public, hang ourselves out to dry.
I win, you keep your mouth shut and your guilt in check, - and we buy ourselves some more time. - You want to wager the fate of millions of people on the outcome of a poker game?
the gods did it all the time... dice, chess, whatever took their fancy.
they loved tinkering with the lives of those mere mortals. - We're not gods, Simon.
20 million deaths on our shoulders.
isn't that what you said?
if that doesn't qualify us for godhood, tell me what does.
let the games begin.
Hey, what's Barstow PD doing here?
let's hope 3-star guy didn't get to our witness.
do you think she drives a gold sedan?
maybe not anymore.
special agent Benford, FBI.
detective Rick Malchiodi, Barstow PD
we think your victim might be an eyewitness in a homicide.
that's a hell of a coincidence. - How's that?
her roommate said she witnessed a homicide, too.
her roommate?
Yeah. Uh, Alvarez...
came home from work, found her roommate there double tapped to the side of her head.
so looks like they got the wrong roommate, huh?
I believe it's to you.
how much do you want to give me this round?
I hope you don't drag this game out as long as the last one.
when you lose, you'll be able to console yourself that I've prevented you from confessing to a mass murder.
manchester figure of speech.
2500. I'll call.
I don't understand.
you're saying they killed Blanca, - but they were trying to kill me? - That's what it looks like to us, yes.
and it's because of what happened in the alley?
now, Ingrid, what exactly did happen in the alley?
we have the video, but it would really help us to get your account.
I was working late, me and one of my clerks.
can't say I see you as a blonde, Ms. Alvarez. - And I can't see you as a rock star, - but that's what you say your vision was. - I was locking up for the night.
you want me to walk you to your car?
I mean, it's kind of late. - I'll be fine.
I went to my car, but there were men in the alley...
three of them. They were fighting, arguing, but I couldn't hear what about.
but when it got physical, I hid.
I called 911, but they put me on hold.
I still can't believe I stayed calm enough to think to use my phone.
my hand was shaking so much.
now you told the police the victim gave the other men something right before they shot him?
they were arguing about a case or something.
but I didn't see what it was.
what about the faces of the other men?
do you think you could describe them? - I didn't get a right look, but I think one of them maybe had gray hair.
the other one was bald, and he was big, muscular.
it was very dark.
we're gonna sit you down with a sketch artist, all right?
whatever you can give us, and if there's anything else you can remember, it could be a big help, okay?
as they were walking away, they were talking about something.
uh, it sounded like "QED
thank you.
you guys ever read about that inevitability index thing that's been in all the papers?
it's a scam...
some entrepreneurial huckster's attempt to sell us on the idea that the odds of the future happening can be "calculated."
it's all rubbish. Fate is fate.
we're not responsible, Lloyd.
what about free will? - No such thing.
Oh, since when did you become such a hard determinist?
simple quantum suicide theory.
I will win this hand and every subsequent hand we play ad infinitum. QED
don't you get tired of hearing yourself pontificate?
don't you get tired of being a self righteous prig.
we're scientists, Lloyd, not attention seeking reality show contestants looking for their 15 minutes of fame on a talk show.
you always do this. - What's that?
use intellectual argument to defend your behavior. - What?
okay, so you sleep with Cabrini's wife, and you call it electromagnetism.
you fire your assistant and blame it on Darwin. - Shut up, Lloyd.
and now you've upended the entire world, - and you hide behind determinist rhetoric. - You're not the only one who's lost someone, Lloyd.
Oh, who, Simon? Who have you ever cared about?
I'll call.
you see, I knew you were bluffing this entire time.
you know why?
because there's no such thing as luck or fate or "there but for the grace of god."
this game is pointless. I've already won.
the future's already happened.
fighting it is futile.
Hey, Nicole.
Hey. You okay?
sorry.
I'm mind wandered.
I'm guessing Mark told you what I saw.
he did, yeah,
but only because he's worried about you.
we both are.
you don't have to be. I'm gonna be fine.
the future can change. It's all over the news.
Hey, crazy huge floral delivery for the quintuplets.
can you give me a hand?
go, go, go.
don't worry, Olivia. You know, we can change what we saw,
just like we could before the blackout.
everything's back to being up to us again.
dad.
my humvee got attacked.
Yeah.
your friend Mike told me that.
but that was two years ago, Tracy.
why didn't you go back to your base?
I couldn't. The attack...
we were fired on by supposed friendlies.
Marines?
Jericho PMC... Private Military Contractors.
Yeah, I've heard about them, but that doesn't explain why.
Jericho works for the military, - Which means that I can't trust the military... - Whoa, hold on a second.
Why，why would you say you can't trust the military?
about two weeks before my Humvee was attacked,
I was working long range recon
on this village in the foothills near Kunar.
I was alone.
orders were to stay covert so the locals wouldn't see me.
but there must have been someone else out there.
and I watched them...
I watched as they wiped out a village.
they killed women, and they butchered children.
they slaughtered them.
Why? Why would they want to do that?
I don't know, but I told my superior officer,
and about a week later, Mike and I pulled duty
at a forward roadblock near the Kalikata Mountains.
out of nowhere, a Haji truck breached our roadblock.
we took off after them.
Damn!
embrace the suck, Stark?
who the hell are these men?
those are Hajis!
burro, Burro! We're gonna get whacked!
get out!
I don't know how I survived.
I thought I was the only one.
what's been going on?
you sounded a little freaked when you called.
did you slip or something? - No, no, no, no.
just, uh, I, uh...
look, I didn't believe it myself.
I took this picture at my house.
Oh... My... God.
it's Tracy.
how? - How?
my Tracy would kill me if she knew I was talking to you, but she was... she was in a Humvee with three other soldiers.
it got blown to hell, a bloody mess...
body parts everywhere, including her leg.
the DNA... - Right.
it got basically thrown into the mix. - Then where has she...
Wh... what has she been doing for the past two years?
this is what I need to talk to you about.
basically, she's been on the run.
she saw something she shouldn't have - and got int in trouble with Jericho. They're this... - Yeah, military contractors.
Yeah. They were ones who attacked her.
I... I know this sounds like something out of a Baldacci novel or something,
but... Tracy was dead, and now she's alive.
so I, uh, I really need your help, Mark.
cause Tracy is scared to death of these Jericho guys, and I'm afraid they're gonna try to find her.
you're alright?
Yeah.
I saw something today, and it got me thinking that if this person's future could come true...
and it did, even though it seemed impossible...
then maybe these visions are more set in stone than we thought.
or maybe we have to work that much harder.
you're right.
you're right.
Hey, did you open my gift?
Oh. They're lovely.
you didn't put 'em on?
I figured you'd just take 'em right off again.
right.
we can change things, Mark.
we just have to decide how badly we want to,
how far we're willing to go to make it happen.
but I say there's nothing, nothing that we shouldn't be willing to do for one another.
so what are you suggesting?
set a trap for our suspects, draw 'em out.
I know a lot's changed lately, but we still don't use civilians as bait.
Ingrid knows the risks.
then work the case. Work... work the... the Parofsky angle.
we've been doing that.
Parofsky was chief engineer at micro-circadian electronics.
he was recently let go on suspicion of corporate espionage.
what if Parofsky is selling his work to the highest bidder?
Ingrid did say that they took a package from him right before they shot him.
so whatever was in there was valuable enough to kill for.
look, Stan, it's a real lead. Ingrid's gonna be protected - on this, I promise. - What makes you so sure they'd try to hit her tonight?
they already tried to kill Ingrid once.
if we get the word out that we're releasing her from custody, they might try again.
why do you say that?
we went to Utah. D. Gibbons knew we were coming.
you unearthed the somalia photos.
five minutes later we're getting shot at.
whoever we're investigating knows what we're doing before we do it.
you think we've got a mole.
we... have a mole.
two men with assault rifles are gonna get into this building five months from now, and someone's gonna let 'em in.
we catch these guys tonight, we can finally put a face on our enemy.
careful, it's hot.
guess there's no chance of getting any bourbon in there.
probably not a good one, no.
when did you start drinkin' whiskey, anyway?
I told Mark Benford.
you what?
he can help. - Are you insane?
you don't know these people, dad.
I gotta get out of here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.
I came to this house specifically because I thought
that I'd be safe, but I see now that that was a big mistake.
mark's a fed, Trace. I mean, he's... He's practically family.
the second that Jericho knows that I'm still alive, they'll find me, and they'll kill me.
that's not true. Don't you remember your flash-forward?
the fact that you even had one proves that you're gonna be alive.
I was with you. I... I gave you my pocket knife.
you were on a cot, fell asleep.
we were in some kind of bunker or cave surrounded by guards, and there was graffiti all over the walls.
I think somebody was calling my name.
then I stepped outside.
there was a man out there.
he was very concerned about you.
he said something strange... - The account has been verified.
then I gave him an envelope,
but I don't know what was in it.
the accounts have been verified.
does that mean something to you?
no. But this guy, what did... what did he look like?
tall, dark. Scar.
khamir Dejan. He was a field medic with the IMC
he... he took care of me.
he... he got me back together.
that's why I left.
I was so afraid that Jericho would kill Khamir to get to me.
that's not gonna happen. Five months from now he's alive.
I saw him. All three of us were there, Trace.
how can you be so sure that everything we saw - will still come true? - Enough of mine has come true already
that I'm a believer. You came back to me, trace.
didn't you?
I don't know what could drag us both back to Afghanistan,
but I have to trust what I saw.
everything looks good out here.
Roger that.
all units, stay on tact-2.
these guys are pros...
former military, based on that video we saw.
Ingrid, you have a lot of amazing birds.
my babies... the only real family I've ever had.
each one of them is special to me.
it's hard to believe I ever thought of giving them up. - What do you mean?
my flash-forward.
in my vision, I wasn't working at the store anymore.
I had blonde hair, and I was living in New York.
so the next day, I put it up for sale.
well, since we're standing here,
I'm guessing you didn't have a lot of buyers.
it was all for the best.
I don't know what I was thinking...
planning on changing my life for a future that might not even come true.
we keeping you awake, cupcake?
I'm sorry, man.
I was up late with Zoey last night. - Oh?
I told her what happens to me...
what's gonna happen to me... supposed to happen to me.
she wants me to quit, get out of the line of fire, I guess.
are you... thinking about it?
I wasn't.
I mean, who knows? I quit, I get hit by a bus, right?
that's my luck. Whatever, right?
what am I supposed to do, become a barista until my date with death?
that's one way to go.
when this is over, whether it's tonight or later,
I'd like for you to have one of my cockatiels.
Oh, no, no.
a thank you gift. Don't make me insist.
Ingrid, if you truly love your birds,
you're not gonna want to give one to me, but thank you.
that's very sweet.
what was that? - Stay here.
Sabre-2, this is sabre-1.
Sabre-2, go.
think I may have some movement here.
you want us to move in on your position?
could be nothing. Let me check it out first.
Sabre-2, we have a breach.
Sabre-2... all units, surround the perimeter! Nobody gets out!
mark, I got Ingrid covered in the back.
Freeze! - Mark!
you saw him turning on me.
he was makin' a move.
it was dark.
I didn't get a good look.
but I do know we can't interrogate a dead man.
what does this all mean? - I'm sorry,
but one of the men you saw is still out there, and he's not gonna stop until he finds you.
we need to put you in witness protection.
that's okay.
I think that's my future.
I should have trusted my gut all along.
judging from your dwindling amount of chips, the pain is almost over.
what are you thinking over there, mate?
maybe you got a pair of 8s, working a full boat.
how much do you have left?
just under 15.
thank you.
why don't we make this hand winner take all?
if you win, we go public.
but of course I'll win, and you'll keep your mouth shut. - Fine.
as a physicist, Lloyd, you really are a genius.
but you were never very good at concealing your tells.
Ouch.
four of a kind for Mr. Camp.
straight flush.
pot and game to Mr. Simcoe. Congratulations.
keep the chips.
call it a tip.
I got what I came for.
how did you beat me?
did I tell you Dylan really loves magic?
sleight of hand's his favorite.
there are some things even I won't leave to chance.
that being said, I'll let you have the first pass at drafting the announcement, all right?
thanks for backing my play there.
I just want to make sure I know which play it was.
is this about taking tattoo man off the streets - or putting him under it? -What the hell are you talking about?
look, I know you said if we get this guy, - we might be able to change our futures. - But?
look, I just want to make sure the plan here isn't to kill him so he can't kill me or come after you in your office.
whatever gave you that idea?
because I had it.
the second you suggested tattoo man might be the guy who's supposed to kill me,
I thought, I'm gonna kill him first.
but now you think I actually did...
that I went that far.
I would've.
what are you doing here so late?
trusting my gut.
hmm.
your e-mail said you had something for me.
Yeah, I do.
NSA Finally sent back
a new rendering of that suspect zero photo.
hmm. Looks like the old one.
it is. This... is the new one.
what's that on his hand?
it looks like a ring.
Mm-hmm. Can the image be enhanced any further?
NSA Is working on it right now,
but it took them this long to get this far.
tell them to put their foot on the gas.
if we can tie this jewelry to the guy wearing it, we'll have our first workable lead.
good job.
Hey.
Wow. You look like you had a perfectly ordinary day.
worse than ordinary?
I killed a man tonight.
what happened?
I had a shot at changing my future...
changing our future...
and I took it.
Oh, Mark.
come here.
come here.
maybe April 29th's just gonna be another day at the office now.
what does that mean?
I, uh...
I told you in my flash-forward I was in danger, right?
a man was trying to kill me.
but tonight...
I got to him first.
I changed the future, Livy.
we have a second chance.
we have a second chance.
Hey.
you have them?
there were supposed to be seven.
after the first atom bomb test,
you know what a colleague of Oppenheimer's said?
what a foul and awesome display.
he then added, "now we are all sons of bitches.
night. - No.
middle of the phone. I got it. - Get it.
Oh! My arm's asleep! My arm's asleep! - Get the phone. Phil, get the phone.
that's me. Hello! Hi.
Yes, this is she.
who is it?
okay. Oh, God.
tell me what's happening here!
Haley has been arrested.
what?
phone! Phone. I bet that's mama. I was just dreaming it was raining chickens!
Mitchell, answer the phone!
look what I am doing. Look what I am doing, huh?
Hello? - Hey, Mitchell.
I'm sorry to wake you up, but Haley got arrested.
Oh, God. Haley got arrested.
that explains the chickens.
it does. It adds up.
what did she get arrested for?
Oh, she got caught drinking at some party.
look, could you drive up to the college with us?
I think we're gonna need a lawyer. - Yes, of course.
and Cam and Lily can come over and stay with Alex and Luke.
I'll guard them with my life. - Yeah, yeah.
I hate to bother him.
no, no, don't be silly. He's happy to do it.
okay, we'll be over in a little bit. Okay.
Oh, I get it.
when you told Claire I would come over and watch the kids, she was resistant because she doesn't trust my parenting skills.
no. Don't be silly. She just didn't want to put you out.
she's got a daughter behind bars and she's got the nerve to say I'm a bad parent?
you didn't defend me. - Because she didn't say anything.
why are you protecting her?
why is no one protecting me?
no.
ay! Answer! Answer!
this better be good.
Haley got arrested for drinking.
we gotta go bail her out.
do you still have a connection to that judge upstate?
he died. - Ay! Who died?
an old friend of mine.
ay, Jay, I'm so sorry.
he died five years ago.
then why are they calling us in the middle of the night to wake us up?!
nobody died. Haley's in jail.
okay. That makes more sense.
Claire has to go bail her out.
okay. Give me that.
Claire, listen to me
take a lot of cash.
and when you flash it to the police, do not speak about it.
let the eyes do all the talking, okay?
I heard the phone. Who died?
Jay's friend. - Oh, Jay, I'm so sorry.
okay. I can't do this again.
it's breakfastIt's breakfast time
it's breaky breaky time
uncle Cam. I thought I heard your voice.
what are you doing here? Where are my parents?
well, the school called, and your sister won a big award.
nice try. The only person who would believe that would be Haley.
she's in jail.
jail?
Lily, what did I say?
that it was only a matter of time.
okay, no. Didn't say that.
okay, so here's the truth.
your sister was caught drinking.
but it's no big deal.
your parents are there taking care of it right now.
so...
this is so awesome!
I hope she hits the weights so she's totally ripped when she gets out.
okay. Let's change the subject. Have a seat. Have some breakfast.
see if there's anything on that plate you like a lot.
is this bacon?
of course it is, silly.
been on a little bit of a health kick lately, so I took a vegan cooking class, and my new thing is "fakon.
it's like real bacon.
except for the look, the texture, and the taste.
maybe the store-bought kind.
but I make my own, so it's not even real fakon.
it's faux-fakon. "Faux-kon.
it's faux-kon disgusting.
you can't tell the difference.
and guess which one's the real one?
that one.
that one.
still that one.
this is the best bacon I've ever had.
Oh, well.
I can't wait to tell your Uncle Mitchell that you love it.
why would Uncle Mitch care?
because, my dear, that bacon you're eating isn't bacon at all, no, no, no.
it's made entirely of soy.
Luke's allergic to soy!
his throat closes! He can't breathe!
Hello? - Never mind!
okay, okay.
we have to, uh, get you to the, uh, hospital!
Lily! Come on, baby. - Okay, Luke! Put the fakon down!
I'm using it to scratch my throat!
okay. Okay. Let's go. Come on. Go.
that was weird.
Hey, Claire, do you wanna pick it up a little bit?
since when do you drive the speed limit?
my daughter has been arrested for drinking.
I would like her to sit in jail and think about that.
as a matter of fact, I might stop and do a little outlet shopping.
who wants a pair of last year's sunglasses, huh?
honey...
try to relax.
I don't feel like relaxing, Phil!
she has been in college for six weeks.
Yeah, and everyone goes a little crazy at first.
more than enough.
I'm not gonna lie.
sometimes it bothers me how calm Phil is under pressure.
it's like...
like I'm the one who's overreacting.
that's good. Let it out. It's g
I'm going to kill you.
Jay, do you have some time today?
we need to go and pick out a stroller.
just get whatever you want.
I mean, it's what you're gonna do anyway.
what I want is a husband who likes to go shopping for a stroller with me.
if you had a husband who liked picking out strollers, you wouldn't be having a baby.
so who wants to come with me to the spoken word festival this evening?
I only have two tickets, so somebody's gonna be disappointed.
I think it's gonna be you.
ay, Manny, I would go with you, but I'm so tired.
you just woke up. How are you tired?
maybe because I'm turning food into a human!
Jay will take you.
sorry, I would love to go to the spoken word festival, but I'm already going to the I'd-rather-blow-my-brains-out jamboree.
I can't believe this.
I'm living in a cultural wasteland.
with a heated pool.
Manny, vamos. You're gonna be late for school.
Oh, jeez.
Hello, DeDe.
good morning, Jay. Namaste.
let's not do this.
Oh, fine, silly.
I'm on my way to a retreat in Ojai, and since I'm passing through town,
I thought I'd pick up that photo album.
you know, it's really not a good time.
Oh, please.
all right. I'll meet you on the street.
drive by slow with the window open.
I was dreading DeDe finding out that Gloria's pregnant.
it's the one thing DeDe's hung on to, that she's the mother of my kids.
and considering their history...
I-I wanna...rip your head off!
No! Please stop it! - Whoa!
No! DeDe!
I wasn't exactly looking forward to round four, especially now that Gloria's a bigger, slower target.
I'd normally be having breakfast right now.
Hi, dad.
Hey, Claire. Any updates?
not yet, but we're almost there.
last time you were over at the house, you were looking at that photo album.
What'd you do with it?
Oh, dad, that was me.
I think I put it on the shelf behind the bar.
what are you doing there?
they asked me to come along in case they needed a lawyer.
shouldn't they have a real lawyer?
Oh, God. Should we?
I am a real lawyer, people. Environmental law is a thing.
don't get all sensitive on me.
I mean someone who doesn't defend pandas.
Yeah, dad,'cause that's what I do.
I-I defend pandas in court.
that's adorable.
you know what I'm talking about.
Haley needs somebody who knows criminal law, like Perry Mason.
okay, so I'm not a real lawyer, but Perry Mason is?
Oh, hell.
Hello, DeDe. How you doing?
Oh, mostly fine.
I have something called a telescoping uterus.
long story. - Aw, jeez.
out of my way!
out of my way! - I can't breathe!
this boy can't breathe.
he's having a severe allergic reaction.
no. You're squeezing me.
he needs medicine. His throat is closing up.
okay. Hold on.
we have an allergic reaction.
a young boy. Obstructed breathing.
what happened?
well, somebody gave him some soy bacon...
that was so good, he couldn't tell the difference.
Mitchell, I can't talk right now.
cam, it's Claire. My phone died.
I just wanted to make sure the kids got to school okay.
Oh, yeah, of course they did. Why wouldn't they have?
I hear we got a boy who can't breathe? - Right here.
what was that?
Oh, I'm just watching an original lifetime movie called "The boy who can't breathe.
that sounded like Alex.
Nope. Just Amanda Bynes. Okay, gotta go.
that's weird.
can you believe how many waffle places we passed?
I can't believe how much dad belittles me.
what were there? Five? Six?
I edited the law review. I passed the bar on my first try.
I have a briefcase. - I'm counting them on the way back.
can we focus?
uh, hi. We're here for Haley Dunphy.
I'm Mitchell Pritchett. I'm miss Dunphy's attorney.
she won't be needing a lawyer today.
Oh, I think I'll be the judge of that.
I'd like to confer with my client now. Thank you.
all you have to do is post bail, and she's all yours.
Really? Oh. That--that's fantastic.
sir, I am in no mood to defend my daughter today, believe me But do you think it is the best use of resources to lock up college kids who've had a few drinks?
ma'am, your daughter was charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer.
what?
you probably should have called a real lawyer, 'cause I don't... I'm not...
look, this has gotta be some kind of mistake.
our daughter's tiny. There's no way she assaulted anyone.
insulted, maybe.
WAS--WAS the cop wearing white socks and dark shoes?
cause that really sets her off.
maybe you should watch this.
stop!
put your hands where I can see 'em!
okay. Now that's very blurry footage.
how can we be sure that that's Haley?
don't you move.
don't hurt me! I'm just a student! I'm Haley Dunphy!
so hot.
hot in here-- no.
how long is this gonna take?
I should be in school. I'm missing biology right now.
you're in a hospital. Just step out into the hallway.
listen to the nurses and doctors talk.
you'll learn more about science and humanity here than you would in a classroom in an entire semester.
attention!
if there's a yogurt in the fridge that says "Theresa,
then only Theresa gets to eat it!
drama. Soak it in.
Oh, good God. - Okay, Luke, the opening is supposed to be in the back.
no way. I don't want people to see my butt.
do I have to get another shot?
are you going to cry again?
should she be here? - Okay. You know what? Nobody's getting any more shots.
we just have to wait for the swelling to go down.
all right? I'm gonna go check on a little paperwork. I'll be right back.
but if it doesn't go down, that leg might have to come off.
sweet. Take them both.
then I could get some of those blade legs and finally be able to dunk.
how you feeling, champ? What do we got here?
the patient presents bronchial inflammation, dermal pruritus, and minor angioedema.
who can tell me the cause?
it's an allergic reaction to soy.
very good.
the rest of you have a lot to learn. Let's keep moving.
stay with Luke.
what is taking so long?
well, in my experience, these things can take time.
so... settle in. This--this could be a while.
there she is.
damn it.
Oh, thank God.
you're okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, mom.
Oh! What the hell were you thinking?
what happened?
it's not a big deal, okay?
there was a party, and people were drinking...
so the police showed up, and everybody ran, so I did, too.
and I started climbing down this fire escape...
and then I heard a cop yell to put your hands up, so I did and I fell... onto him.
you could have been killed.
Haley, you're supposed to be an adult.
how could you do something so childish...
okay, okay, okay, okay. - And so stupid?
let's calm down. We're all a little tired and cranky.
best thing we can do right now is get out of here, go get some waffles
I don't want waffles, Phil, okay?
I'm upset and I want to deal with this.
all right, I got some bad news here.
um, this afternoon,
Haley has to appear before a disciplinary board, which will decide whether or not she gets kicked out of school.
what?
Oh, wait. Wait, no. I got that wrong.
Oh, no, I got it right!
Yes! Score. 1 for me.
it's what it sounds like.
it literally telescopes.
you see, what happens is-- - DeDe, I hate to rush this, but I'm late for a meeting.
and it's been great seeing you, but can I walk you out?
okay. Sure.
ay, Jay, it's so weird.
the moment I came through the door, the baby started kicking like crazy, like it's trying to claw its way out of me.
Bruja!
Oh, my God.
what is she doing here?
you're going to have a baby?
I don't believe it.
uh, DeDe, don't get all crazy about this.
what's happening?
her brain. It snapped.
Oh! You're going to be a father again at your age.
and here you were thinking you would just sail off into the sunset with your beautiful young wife, not a care in the world.
this is fantastic!
I think my uterus just fixed itself.
don't ask.
who lives like this?
when I had a dorm room, it was...
Oh--it was spotless.
can we just agree that girls are dirtier than boys?
what should we do? - Well, I'd like to start by picking up some of these clothes. Then
I meant about the hearing, Felix.
do we have a game plan?
I think the best thing we can do is walk in there as a family and let them know we support Haley no matter what.
at this rate, we are going to be supporting Haley for the rest of our lives.
okay. Oh, I...
I just sat on half a peach, so I-- no.
I can't do this. I'm--I'm waiting outside.
disgusting.
what are you wearing?
what? What's wrong with it?
honey, you are fighting for your future in front of a disciplinary committee, not entertaining the secret service.
in "Legally blonde," Elle won her case because she was true to herself and dressed cute.
Haley, this is real life, not an excellent movie.
honey, just put on something else, and take down the makeup.
why are you guys acting like this is my fault?
everybody was drinking, everybody ran.
I just got caught. If anything, I'm the victim here.
What?! Just stop-- just stop talking, Haley.
you're not the victim here. You're the one who screwed up!
you made one bad decision after another, and now you're about to blow everything your mother and I worked so hard to give you.
and the worst thing is, you don't seem to care.
we all got up at 3: 00 A. M. this morningto bail you out of jail!
we haven't eaten a thing, and you know what I haven't heard from you yet?
I'm sorry, mom. I screwed up, dad. Please forgive me.
now put on some real clothes.
we'll see you at the hearing. Do not be late!
come on.
where are you going?
to get that man a waffle.
there. There. Did you feel it kicking?
Oh, yes! Oh, I remember those.
Yeah, Claire kicked me as soon as she grew legs, and she didn't stop until she was 4.
not Manny.
he was so calm, I think that he was reading in there.
this is beautiful.
look at you two, having a conversation like old friends.
well, it's easier to talk to her when she's not choking me.
I'm sorry.
I went through a bad patch there when I was trying to find the right balance with my meds.
I recently discovered my cat Frances buried in the backyard.
I'm just praying that she died first.
maybe you can dogsit for the shoe-eater one day.
Oh, well, she is a... funny-looking thing.
don't listen to them. You're beautiful.
turns out Gloria being pregnant somehow made DeDe think of her as less trophy, more human.
and all the animosity she had for Gloria just wafted up in the air...
I hope you're hiring a nanny, because this one won't lift a finger.
and landed right on top of me.
I don't remember him changing a single diaper.
what's that supposed to mean?
you can't even remember killing your cat.
Oh, I don't think I did.
but I'm sure that you never changed any diapers.
it's just that you were better at it than I was.
Oh, so I guess I was better at late-night feedings and cleaning spit-up, too.
you know what?
he wouldn't help me pick up a stroller or a blanket or a bouncy chair.
Oh, well, I had to get that stuff on my own.
he was just useless.
you poor thing.
makes all sense now why you became so crazy.
right?
listen to me, Jay Pritchett.
if you don't change your useless ways, you're gonna make me crazy, too!
like DeDe!
I just love our little visits.
mom, I'm home!
Oh, hi, Manny.
DeDe. How are you?
good.
DeDe. It's me.
how are you really?
I'm on a better path.
it's a journey.
thank you for asking, Manny.
and thank you for your letters.
it's a lost art.
no one puts pen to paper anymore.
Yes, that's me.
I'm Dean Miller with admissions. This is Professor Williams.
and this is our student representative, Aidan Feldman.
nice to meet you. - Seriously?
we sit next to each other in Econ.
Oh, right. You-- - Don't.
it insults both of us.
mostly me.
move it along, Aidan.
this is a disciplinary hearing, not JDate.
you are charged with public drunkenness, resisting arrest, and assaulting a police officer, all of which obviously violate our school's code of conduct.
sir, if I may speak on behalf of my client...
who are you? - I'm Mitchell Pritchett,
I'm miss Dunphy's attorney.
we require students to speak for themselves.
there are no attorneys allowed. You shouldn't even be here.
what if I just sat in this chair and I was really super quiet and I just listen?
I'll allow it.
knock it off, Aidan.
miss Dunphy, is there anything you would like to say in your defense?
actually, I have no defense.
I was drinking. I am underage.
I ran from the police.
and even though it was an accident, I injured an officer.
I am very, very sorry.
I've made a lot of bad decisions since I've been here, and it's time I take some responsibility.
like sometimes in the dining hall,
I slip my pinky under the scale when they weigh my salad.
also, I've missed more morning classes than I've been to.
she's kidding. - I don't know what the policy is on dating T. A.S, but I think I broke it.
twice. - Oh, man.
Oh, and if we're gonna be completely honest, on my application to get in here, - I lied about the fact that I was-- - Uh, objection!
on what grounds? - Oh, he gets to say it?! He gets to
miss Dunphy, miss Dunphy, we appreciate your... candor.
is there anything else you'd like to add?
go, Wildcats?
Oh, boy.
that's not even our mascot.
what does this do?
I don't know, but thanks to Obama, you're paying for it.
Hey. You're looking a lot better. How you feeling?
better than kidney stones over there.
Yeah, you know what? Now that you're doing better,
I think I should call your mom and tell her what happened.
you know, I know it was a bit of a rough ride in the beginning, but the important thing is, is I handled it.
and everybody's okay. - What happened to her?
Hello? - She passed out watching a C-Section.
never mind!
what are you looking for?
nothing! I am making a lot of noise because I'm angry!
Gloria, I'm gonna help you with the baby.
I am not young like with Manny.
I am tired already, and it's gonna get harder from here!
I can't do this on my own, and you did this to me, so you're going to be here this time!
back then, we were living paycheck to paycheck.
the reason I wasn't around is I was working all the time.
believe me, DeDe wasn't the only one having sleepless nights.
but now it's different.
now I can help you with everything.
Really?
let's start right now.
I like that one. Which one?
that silver stroller.
no, we're going to get the green one.
great. What's next?
how about I pick out the wrong crib?
how you doing, Alex?
I'm fine, except for the crushing blow of knowing I'll never be a doctor.
or have a baby.
I wonder what's going on with Haley.
I don't know.
I've been so petty about your mom judging my parenting,
I haven't even thought about what she's going through today.
I feel awful. You know what? I should call her.
what are you talking about? Mom thinks you're a great parent.
she does?
Yeah, she just thinks you can't bake.
Hello?
never mind.
making a child is the easy part.
the hard part is everything that comes after.
keeping them safe...
well, you can tell your mother that my scones are appropriately crunchy on the outside while delightfully dense on the ins
saw that. Saw it.
making sacrifices for them...
Hey, kid.
I'll take you to that poetry reading thing tonight.
actually, DeDe and I were just talking.
she's a huge fan of spoken word...
and I would love to escort him.
please. - Go.
and standing by them, even when they let you down.
I really am sorry.
we appreciate that.
it's good that you stepped up today.
Yeah. Sometimes it's healthy to get a fresh start.
Ugh. I can't believe this. What am I gonna do?
well, they said you could reapply next year.
in the meantime, you're gonna get a job and you're gonna take some classes.
well, I'm gonna buckle down and get a lot more serious.
good for you. - Yeah.
where are my keys?
Oh, they're right there on the makeup table.
Oh, honey...That's a desk.
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?
I got kicked out.
so go ahead, make your jokes. Get it out of your system.
no, that's horrible. I'm so sorry.
it'll be fine. I'm sure of it.
thank you.
EW, what did you do to my room?!
well, it's not exactly your room. It's--it's mine.
this goes. This goes. I hate that.
this is ugly. - Haley, stop!
mom! - Mom!
what is this? A solar system?
it's molecules.
they're nerdy balls.
Alex, don't fight with her. She might have a shiv.
we cool?
thank you, Captain, Mrs Ainsworth.
can't I come to the station?
I'm not that brave.
Oh, my darling Lizzie.
simple ART OF MURDER
the MURDER AT THE VICARAGE
my egg was hard again, Mary
blame the chicken.
no.
Oh, no.
Yes.
Dennis...
must you, on a Sunday?
Sorry,Uncle Leonard, but she's playing up.
you can't go to church like that.
Oh, I'm not anyway. This could be a long job.
Mary!She won't hear you.
can't even boil an egg!
she's all we can afford, you old misery.
you knew I couldn't cook when you married me.
and you knew I was old.
look at the time!
Oh.
morning, Miss Marple.--Good morning.
how did you manage that, Griselda?
he'll be early for once.
I shall tell you this evening, Jane.
and bring some your damson gin over
it might take the edge off Mary's cooking.
# The summer days are come again #
# Once more the glad earth yields #
# And deepening shade of summer woods #
# And glow of summer air #
# And winging thoughts and happy moods #
# Of love and joy and prayer... #
but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed.
then, when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin, and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
here endeth the lesson.
stop wriggling, Lettice!
it's Letteece.--Everyone calls you Lettice.
you're not everyone, Lawrence.
behave. Don't forget where you are.
steady.
you should be on a calendar.
we could hang it in your father's study.
Oh, Lawrence.
get an eyeful, creeping around?
she's in her bathing suit.
mr Redding's an artist.
it's like looking at a bowl of cherries for him.
until she takes it off.
you've got an oily nose.
last Sunday's collection in aid of the Church of England Missionary Society, a total of 18 shillinga 11 pences. Well done, everybody.
that can't be right.--What?
the society benefits enormously from the efforts we make.
I put in a pound to myself.
I have here a letter of thanks from the secretary.
Colonel...
Yes, Marjorie?
there's something wrong... --What?
Shh!
What?--Shh.
you are quite sure?
I always put a pound note into the box on the anniversary of poor Bruce's passing.
I know, but perhaps this time...
come on, Miss Marple!
if Marjorie says she put a pound in then she did, so where's it gone?
I thought you'd be straining at the leash to sniff out the culprit.
you do have a reputation to maintain.
my reputation, Colonel Protheroe, if I have one
how kind of you to suggest I do - is neither here nor there.
I merely wonder if it's too early to talk of culprits.
Nonsense!--Lucius.
Anne, don't paw me.
now, look. I'm a church warden, and I was in intelligence.
I know when something smells fishy.
it could be the tip of the iceberg. Vicar!
Jane, shall we try the Toby Jug tomorrow just for a change?
good idea.
Where's Lettice this morning?
mr Redding's painting her.--On a Sunday?
Mm-hm.--You don't think...?
he does have a way with him, but she's just a girl.
I'd plump for an older candidate if there is somebody.
don't forget, ladies, tea and scandal tomorrow at 4: 30.
and I've invited Mrs Lester.--I'm coming!
perhaps we'll find out a little more about her.
something would be a start. Fancy staying at the Blue Boar.
not very homely for her.
very well-stocked, if you take my meaning.
Oh? --Tipsy at the jumble sale.
why the dear vicar had to choose such a shallow wife and at his age too...
I expect to see a full set of parish accounts or I'm going to take this matter further.
yes? Is that quite clear?
Yes.--Tuesday. Vicarage, 6: 15 sharp.
I know what you mean.
Colonel, any news of your architectural sleuths?
Yes, Dr Haydock.
they arrived last night.
they'll be taking photographs and making drawings. Still
one of the perils of owning an important house like Old Hall.
good day, Doctor.
what a dreadful, dreadful man.
I'll walk, Daddy.-- No. Get in.
how's the portrait coming along?
perfectly well, thank you, Anne.
Lettice...I thought he was painting you in that pretty blue dress of yours. - - Yes......
but today he was just doing my hands so I didn't bother to wear it.
what have you got in there?
nothing.
let me see.
come.
I-it's more artistic.
there's art and there's smut!
how dare he? And how dare you?
SSH, ssh.
don't shout, for goodness' sake.
I'll fight my own battles. Thank you, Anne.
I was thinking of our guests.
good morning, Professor.
do you have everything you need?
thank you, yes. Your so charming daughter was most helpful.
stepdaughter.
Ah, la Belle au Bois dormant, s'eveille.
je m'excuse, grand-pere. Good morning.
morning, mademoiselle. Lunch will be at half past twelve.
my husband's very keen to hear about your research.
we are flattered, aren't we, Grandfather?
not as much as he is.
permitting that sort of behaviour in your own garden, Vicar?
no, no. I mean it's...it's utterly unacceptable.
now, Mr Redding's telephone number, please.
isn't it gorgeous?
nothing quite so beautiful as an English summer's evening.
for our hostess? How lovely!
not as lovely as that stuff, I hear.
shall we?
Oh, thank you.
bless this food to our use and us to thy loving and faithful service nourished by the fruit of your earth and by the work of human hands.
may we render you true obedience, Lord and bend ourselves to thy will.
and make us ever needful of the minds of others.
er, ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen.
Amen.
well, I can only apologise.
the colonel's always looking for an excuse to criticise.
I hope you're not painting Griselda in a bathing suit?
miss Marple, that's disgusting.
thank you.--Certainly not.
but you must come to see it, Mr Clement.
it's at that very interesting stage.
like Dennis?--Oh, ha-ha.
pop over tomorrow, around teatime.--I will.
what is this, Mary? --Soup.
does it have a name?
bis and bobs and odds and sods and the meat raion's been cut again soup.
sorry. Sorry.
you're a bag of nerves this evening, Mr Hawes.
not just tonight. May I have a glass of water?
anyone else?-- No, thank you.
if it wasn't for my medicine, you see...
don't worry, you can't catch nerves.
it's a wretched affliction I bear with God's grace.
talking of wretched afflictions
Ronnie, Colonel Protheroe on Tuesday.
can you get the parish accounts into some sort of order?
I'll try.--I could strangle Protheroe sometimes.
may God forgive me.--I'd stab him.
I'd poison him.--I'd shoot him.
use my gun.--He's so rotten to Lettice.
Aw.--Just because he bought Old Hall, he thinks he's the local squire something.
you can't treat people like that now.
you're quite right. And how would you do it, Miss Marple?
I never speak lightly of murder, Mr Redding.
I hate to tempt fate.
surely not in this lovely place?
we're all very ordinary in St Mary Mead, but ordinary people sometimes do the most astonishing things
do you really have a pistol?--Somewhere. It's German.
I liberated it.--Were you wonderfully brave?
very well-trained, but scared to death.
I'll clear in five minutes.
fish and turnip stew-mostly turnip.
Oh, bring the apricot chutney, will you?
St Mary Mead vicarage.
no, Frankie, I can't.
but you'lI have your mum there.
who's the magistrate?
that'll be two-quid fine at least
how are we ever going to save up to get a...
I am very sorry but you have mistook a wrong number.
I forbid you to see him again!
he was only painting me.
I wish he were doing something else stupid the fuss you're making.
don't be common!--Well, don't be horrid, then.
you've driven the Dufosses to bed because your foul mood.
well, you blood can go too!--Gladly.
sit down. We haven't finished.--Good night, Lucius.
there are those who take a romantic view of poaching, Tarrant.
I do not.
this time, you'll go to prison.--Sir, you can't, sir!
all right, Mum.--Madam, sit down.
28 days.--I'll lose my job, you old bastard.

St Mary Mead vicarage.
it's not fair!
Mary?--I'm going out!
it's not just the difference in our ages, Jane.
the vicar and his wife are perfectly happy.
they'd be happier with a child, I think.
it would be their own.
Lettice was two when her mother died.
by the time I married Lucius, she was too old to think of me as anything other than the wicked stepmother.
I get on her nerves, and...
I'm afraid she gets on mine.
that makes him angry - even angrier than normal.
might you have a child of your own one day?
no.
That...side of things has dwindled rather.
completely.
I need tenderness, Jane.
and that's just not in his nature.
thank you.
sorry.
Oh, we all have to get things off our chest occasionally.
still... I married him for a kind of certainty.
we all wanted certainty after the war, didn't we?
I must settle for what I've got.
make do and mend?--Make do.
and at least there once was someone tender, but he didn't come back from the fighting.
Jane, I knew you'd come.
I had to.--Oh, my darling.
there's our lift
we'd better not keep him waiting.
bloody fool!
help me!
are you hurt?
no Oh!
Yes.--Caught her ankle.
Oh...
I'm so terribly sorry.
it wasn't your fault.
it has to support the sprain.
I have a stick in the car.
you might be able to hobble by tomorrow.
I don't want to be a hobbler, Dr Haydock.
shall I make some tea?
apparently, that won't be necessary.
it seems tea and scandal are coming to us.
I am lost. The small drawing room with the Flemish tapestry and the magnificent ceiling?
two down on the other side. That's my father's study.
heard me, then?--How could I not, Dennis?
want to go for a ride?--On that thing?
last year, we... --I was 16 and it was fun.
well, I haven't seen Lawrence Redding in a sports car.
he would if he had the money and he'd look so wonderfully...mature.
see you tomorrow for tennis?
Oh, yes, tennis with Dennis.
how did he get on?
a month inside. Protheroe.
mr Redding, you should shut this away.
probably.
here's one for you next time you're in the Blue Boar.
you sure you don't want me to start locking up when I go?
this is the heart of England, Mrs T.
besides, lock up the house and you lock out love.
Oh, my Lord! In her bathing suit?
the colonel won't have liked that from what I've seen.
looks like he's got a poker up his bum.
at least one.
will you be staying long in St Mary Mead, Mrs Lester?
Sylvia, please.
I shall have to see.--We're not too quiet for you?
like a millpond. But a change is as good as a rest.
a change...from what...exactly?
my helter-skelter life, Miss Hartnell.
if you'll excuse me, I must...
I must see how Griselda's portrait is coming along.
I do hope you like it, darling.
Goodbye.--Bye.
good afternoon, Vicar.--Goodbye.
and what are you wearing for Mr Redding?
just my dignity, Mrs Price-Ridley, and a pink feather boa.
really, Griselda!
I think I'll just refresh the pot.
now, who'd like a stiffener in their Darjeeling?
Oh, I...
Vicar...--No...
I'd forgotten you were coming.
is he doing Mrs Protheroe too?
quite a busy boy with his brush.
she offered to come to London, but...
well, I came here to get away from it and...
well, Anne wouldn't be suited to the the madness of my life there.
and I wouldn't want her to be. I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of being wild.
you're quite wild enough for us.
I just feel that I've let you all down.
I've been happier in St Mary Mead than I've ever been in my life.
even my work's better, I think.
that's certainly less wild.--But you must end it.
I can't.--Then you should consider leaving.
think of her reputation.
you are the only one who knows.
yet. You only have to sneeze in this village for someone to
miss Bourne's here about next week's flowers.
Oh, she's late. That's not like her.
please, please think about what I've said.
old Hall. Good evening.
Yes, he is. Who shall I say?
I'll have to give a name, madam.
residents ONLY
what do you want, Sylvia?
to tell you something, and see that stiff upper lip wobble as if you were facing a firing squad.
last cigarette?
blindfold?
bang.
I'll manage the stairs by tomorrow.--Dressing gown?
Yes, please.
how was the portrait?
a brief viewing?
you saw.--I'm afraid we all did.
Griselda was horrified when I told her.
if Protheroe finds out...
now, I know he's a brute, but Anne married him, and I believe in the sanctity of marriage.
I'm so lucky.
she could have had anyone.
she chose you.
it's been the best three years of my life.
here we are.
hairbrush, mirror and book.
is it a good read?
betcha life it is, padre.
anything else from the dressing table?
no.
beautiful.
a perfect example for this period.
indeed. When are you going to publish?
autumn is the next edition of our journal.
Ah. It will be all English country houses.
I will send you a copy from Paris. I'll make a note of it.
how is France now?
France? And, well, what do you say?
we are getting on our feet.
how was your war?
bad things happened.
and yours, Colonel?
unfortunately, I, er...
I am not at liberty to discuss my service.
Lucius...--Hmm? Ah. Good day to you.
I'll be back on the 5: 30.
I have a meeting with Mrs Ross-Harkins after court.
don't forget the vicarage at a quarter past six.
aren't there any sales in Melchester?
london is London.
well, don't buy too much.
there won't be too much!
Dennis is taking me.--What?
only to the station.--Oh.
Bye.--Bye.
Oh, look at this scratch!--Well, what about my wheel?
you weren't looking, you fool!
mind on other things, I dare say, like those accounts.
what do you mean?--Well, we'll see what I mean.
just make sure the vicar has them for six fifteen.
it does have brakes, you know, this car
good God, woman!
thank you.
Ah, Mrs Clement.--Colonel.
Melchester?
London.
I trust your garden shed will shortly be restored to its proper purpose.
it has never had an improper purpose.
clearly our standards are different.
clearly, I'm glad to say.
I beg your pardon?
why are you so dreadful to Len?
he's a good, honest man who tries to set an example of Christian charity.
perhaps charity can begin too close to home.
return to Melchester, please.
mr Redding ran after the vicar and Mrs Protheroe had her shoes off and I'm sure you could see her petticoat.
when I went to pay my paper bill this morning,
florrie Ranby said she wasn't at all surprised, and, of course, Miss Marple knew it was someone older.
the colonel read a most apt lesson on Sunday had he but known it:
when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.
I have to put this right.
my parents want me to go to Kenya help them manage the farm.
you could try for university.
I would if I had something else to stay for.
Dennis... Apart from anything...
well, you know Daddy, money or prospects.--Nought out of two.
you mean, if it wasn't for him...?--No.
well, who knows?
can't we just be friends?
you can forget about Lawrence.
uncle Len walked in on him and your stepmother and he wasn't painting her.
shall I be mother?--Thank you.
I do love her, you know. It's not just about...
sex?
I keep thinking about whavicar said about people knowing, and I got a very strange look in the newsagent's from Mrs Whale.
well, she's got wind of things.
the only reason Mr Goldworthy knew about his wife and the Gl was when he heard Mrs Whale mention the nylon stockings and the chewing gum.
I'll have to leave, for Anne's sake.
that's very brave.
Yes, well, I'll soon be over it.
you won't.
not for a long while.
nothing gets past you, Miss Marple, does it?
hardly ever, young man.
I'll tell the vicar now.
he won't be back from his calls yet.--Nor will he.
there is something I could do for you, Miss Marple.
if you'd like.
mr Redding in the study.
it's the right decision.
have you told her?
I need to find the words.--You will.
well, you're very trusting.
I'm not that sure of myhelf.
I'll clear out the shed.
thank you for letting me set up in there.
that was Griselda.--I never did finish her painting.
you're a very lucky man.
look after her for me, won't you?
Anne, I mean.
et maintenant... Maintenant qu'est-ce qu'on fait?
sois patient. Je dois penser.
Ah, Mary. Erm, old Mr Abbott over at Lower Farm, his neighbour's telephoned to say he's poorly again, so I won't be back by 6: 15.
apologise to Colonel Protheroe and ask him to wait for me.
I'll be as nice as I can.
I can still see it now, his first day in the village.
it was one of those moments when you know that nothing will ever be the same again.
he reminded me of what might have been in the days when I still hoped for happiness.
there can be happiness in acceptance, you know, of what can't change.
can there?
thank you, Jane.
what for?
for not judging me.
he'll be late.--Oh, it's all right.
I'll wait.--You'll have to, won't you?
Oh, thank you.
there's a sweet little crested wren that likes this side of the woods.
did Lawrence mention the future at all?
I'll go, I'll go.
St Mary Mead 235.
it was for me.
for you?--I'm...wanted at the vicarage.
sorry.
bonsoir, Monsieur le Professeur.
Ah, bonsoir, madame.
a beautiful evening for walking, no?
if only I could.
Oh.
goodbye, Mr Redding.
bonsoir, madame.
Oh, une petite promenade, c'est tout.
if you're going back now, may I join you?--Yes.
thank you.
a large one. I've had a hell of a day.
good evening, Mary.
wait in the study with the colonel.--He's here?
he is.
show me your ways, O Lord, teach me your paths.
guide me in your truth and teach me.
show me your ways, O Lord, teach me your paths.
guide me in your truth and teach me. What must I do?
what must I do?
did you want to see me again?
mr Redding?
how's Mr Abbott?--Convalescing in Bournemouth.
someone's idea of a joke.
no, no. No.
detective Inspector Slack.
Leonard Clement. I'm the vicar.
the collar's a clue. Is the doctor here?
Yes.
Len, what's going on?
haIf an hour, at a guess.
certainly no more than 30 minutes before my examination.
which was when?
well, the vicar found him at just gone quarter to seven.
I'm only down the road... Say I got here at ten to.
almost spot on.
time of death about 6: 20, then.
better than almost.
give the man a coconut.
dear Vicar,
I'm afraid I cannot wait for you any longer, but must...
that's it.--Pistol?
Yes.
are these always open?
usually, in this weather.
so, the vicar's called away with a bogus message, murderer comes in through the garden.
victim writing a note with back turned.
that's how and when.
just why and who?
the lady in the cottage with a view of the back here...
miss Marple? I need to interview her.
would you tag along? These old maids tend to get nervous.
if you're not quite sure of something
I'll wait until you have a little think.
did you see anyone enter the vicarage around 20 past six?
Yes. Mrs Protheroe.
is that when you think he was killed?
it looks like it.
how's your hearing?
it's excellent.
so you would have heard a gun fired from the vicarage?
it's hard to say. I did hear a shot about 6: 30 in the woods, I thought, which is not unusual, but...
whether one could tell the difference...
what about this artist, Mr Redding?
well, he looked terribly shocked.
I assumed he'd discovered the body.
of course, he and the colonel...
he'd been painting Lettice - in a bathing suit.
Oh, avant-garde. Is that the term?
I don't believe it.
what? At the vicarage?
Yes, ma'am.--Anne?
Lucius is dead.
is it really true, Mr Hawes?
I heard it at the station.--Yes.
I'm on my way to the vicarage.
was there much blood?--How would I know that?
no.
do you think it was a crime of passion?
after all, Mrs Protheroe and Mr Redding...
fornication always has consequences, but I don't think we should jump to conclusions.
the colonel was not much liked by anyone, was he?
no. I'm afraid not.
of course, his appointment with the vicar was hardly a secret.
are there any secrets in St Mary Mead?
lots. Yet. I hope.
I want to talk to someone.
when was this?--Didn't Mary hear anything?
her wireless was turned up full blast as usual.
no. Wait till I get there.
she did hear the colonel sneeze very loudly.
who's speaking to him? I'll be right there.
that's how, when and who.
now for why
lawrence Redding just walked into the station and confessed, and he's brought the murder weapon.
good night.
old Hall.
it is terrible.
we will leave on the afternoon train, of course.
has the police an idea of who could do this thing?
I have.
it's the police, madam.
excuse me.
no, Inspector, he can't. He... I can't...
why does Inspector Slack think the coloneI was shot at 20 past six?
he'd started writing a note to vicar saying he couldn't wait
he'd put the time on it.--Had he?
and the clock stopped at just gone 6: 20.
he knocked it off the desk when he took the bullet.
Oh, dear.
I'm afraid I must put a cat amongst the inspector's pigeons.
he was going on and on about his daughter, which was just her silly little crush, so I told him it was his wife he had to worry about, just to shut him up.
then he really started.
I thought about what I was leaving her to...
and I shot him.
the Chief Constable sends his regards.
isn't that lovely?
I have been of some assistance to him from time to time.
he said.
it's the clock.
I happen to know Mrs Clement put it a quarter of an hour fast on Sunday to improve the vicar's punctuality.
well, wonderful. Did it work?
Yes.--I'm glad to hear it.
so, either it was really five past six when it stopped, before the colonel even arrived for his appointment, or the murderer moved the hands back to match the time on the note.
it still fits - the artistic touch.
but Mr Redding was in the lane at 20 past six.
I saw him.--You may well have done, Miss Marple, but he killed the colonel at 6. 45. Mary let him in.
the vicar saw him leave.--6: 45?
but I only examined at ten to.
and told me that he'd died within the last 30 minutes.--At the most, I said.
6: 20 or a little before, yes.
6: 30...6. 40 at a pinch, but if Redding says he shot him at 6: 45, he's lying.
and doctors are never wrong?
I've got a confession.
if the bullet killing the colonel doesn't match Redding's gun, I'll eat my handcuffs.
sometimes, the simple explanation is the right one.
last night's wasn't.
I'll have someone see you out.
if he was shot at a quarter to seven, why had he stopped in the middle of a sentence at 20 past six?
Anne...--I have to telephone the police.
I'd like someone with me.
I killed him.--What time?
miss Marple saw me going at about 20 past six.
I just...
I just hated him so much, I shot him.
with?
his old service revolver
he always kept it loaded and I took it.
Anne, you didn't have a gun.--It was in my bag.
you didn't have a bag.
there was nowhere else it could have been, not in that dress
St Mary Mead 23...
Yes, speaking.
is that definite?
right.
I don't like my time wasted, Mrs Protheroe.
the bullet that killed your husband was fired from Mr Redding's gun.
but he did it for me.--He didn't do it for anyone.
I released him half an hour ago.
he just happened to be carrying his gun which I don't believe.
and more important, and something that you didn't think of, if the coloneI was shot at a quarter to seven, why did he stop the note like that at 6: 20?
Oh, yes.--Hm-hm.
er...
but if it was his gun... --We'll find out.
he thinks I'm arresting you for murder.
Anne!--Lawrence!
sealed with a loving kiss?
it's to my Frank.
is he allowed to receive letters when he's not breaking rocks?
he ain't doing hard labour.
who would have thought it, though? Mr Redding.
such a nice young man.
nice enough to keep a gun in the house?
I blame that Mrs Protheroe. The way she swans around.
you'd think she was in a magazine, the look of her.
she put Mr Redding up to it, if you ask me.
excuse me.
my football pools.
you never know. I only just missed out on ￡1, 000 last week.
money is the root of all evil.
I'd give it space in my garden.
Bye.
Oh, I'd better... I don't want to speak out of turn, especially if it wasn't anything.
the police have released Lawrence.
mr Redding. --Have they? Then, I wonder...
this must be so unsettling for you.
I can't bear it.
I was on my way to the church, Mrs Clement.
shall we pray together?
Erm...I-I need to find Mr Charlesworth before he closes for lunch.
I need some of those...
Oh, whatever you call them! Good and sharp.
Mrs Protheroe was only out of sight for 30 seconds at most then she went into the shed.
mr Redding joined her from the lane.
he told me He was saying goodbye to her, leaving the village
she must have been terribly upset.
they stayed there for ten minutes or so.
the church clock struck a half hour.
they came out again, meeting Monsieur Dufosse, who appeared from the footpath to Old Hall.
then his granddaughter arrived.
Dufosse?--Mm. Guests of the Protheroes.
you don't keep it shut away?
Yes, yes, I know, I know I should.
Mrs Tarrant who mucks me out is always telling me off about that, and I never lock up during the day.
did you recognise...
when was the last time you saw the gun before it turned up in the study?
Erm...the day before yesterday.
did you recognise the voice...
wouldn't you prefer to rest your ankle, Miss Marple?
no, thank you. Did you recognise the voice on the telephone?
no. It just said to come straight over to the vicarage if I didn't want Lucius to find out about us.
a man or woman?--A woman. I think.
it did sound quite faint as if someone was holding the receiver away from them.
so it could have been a man.--Well spotted, Vicar.
who knew you we re at Miss Marple's?-- No one.
someone must have seen me arrive.
Er...watching me.
my husband's dead. I...
so, you came through the garden, and up to the French windows and then what happened?
Yes, they were open, but I didn't hear any voices.
I looked in and no-one was here, so I went up to the shed to see if I could find Lawrence.
no-one here? That's impossible.
did you come right in?
no. I just...popped my head in.
Ah. It's the biggest aspidistra in the world.
if the coloneI was here at the desk you wouldn't have seen him alive or dead.
sit down.
a drink at the Blue Boar then you returned to see the vicar again about your situation, and then what?
the authorised version this time.
I came in. He was dead. I saw my gun.
I thought that Anne had finally had enough so I picked it up and I left.--And you confessed to protect her.
and you returned the favour because you thought he'd done it.
very love's young dream.
I bet you two are down the Odeon every Friday.
tell your guests I need to speak to them.
don't think about leaving this village until I say so. Go.
erm... Sorry.
excuse me.
you don't like Mr Clement, do you?
nothing personal.
vicars in general...remind me of marriage.
Ah...of course.--Of course what?
miss Hartnell's cousin's maid is just walking out with a butcher's boy from Melchester who delivers to your mother-in-Law.
Mrs Slack has been staying with her for a...
little holiday, I gather.
a little two-month six-day holiday, so far.
Oh, dear. --Hm.
of course
I've only got Mr Clement's word about the bogus call.
surely you don't suspect him?
Erm...--May I?
please.
0.263888888889
I'm afraid I cannot wait for you any longer.
the colonel was...not the most patient of men, but the vicar would only have been five minutes late at 20 past six.
Mary had warned him he wouldn't be on time when she showed him in.
hm. 6: 20.
the ink is...don't you think, blue-black, rather than blue?
Yes, and the writing's smaller.--Mm.
thank you, Miss Marple.
that means he could have been shot after 6: 20, and then the murderer put that onto the note and then altered the clock...
to the time when Mrs Protheroe came here in answer to her anonymous telephone call.
and Mr Redding's gun as the murder weapon.
I think they were being...er...
set up as pasties.
Patsies...it is.
Mm.
thank you, Inspector.
sorry. Sorry, I'll come back. I was looking for some...
you're exactly where he was killed, aren't you?
how horrible. Do you know who did it?
not yet, no.
'Vengeance is mine,I will repay " ,said the Lord.
well, someone beat the Lord to it.
I need some water. For my medicine.
but supposing he was killed at 6: 30?
that would tie in with the shot that you heard.
if it was from here.
you're sure the only person you saw come in was Mrs Protheroe at 6: 20?
through the garden, certainly but I can't see the French windows from my cottage.
and the woods come right up on this side.
it would be a scramble, but if one was determined or if one came in through the hall.
the colonel was deaf, so they could creep up behind him.
the hall? No, no cos Mary would have let them in the front door.
hasn't she told you it's often left open?
Mary!
is this wise?
you're not exactly green-fingered.
Oh, don't fuss, darling! Trust me.
pass those scissory things, would you?
Len?
sorry.
thank you. Ooh!
watch YOUR WIFE CHAPTER 7 VERSE 2
Oh!--Sorry to startle you, Lettice.
you have my deepest sympathy.--Oh. Yes.
m m. Do you know you've got some paint on you?
that's been there ages. I must have it cleaned.
you haven't seen a yellow beret?
No.--I'm sure I left it in here last week when I came to see Dennis.--I'm sorry.
you? Gardening?
well, I have to do something.
what did you bring back yesterday?--Hm?
from London.--Oh, yes, London.
I couldn't find a thing I wanted.--Not like you.
Bye.--Bye.
I had a man-to-man word with the photographer.
he said he'd send me--Shh! Let me just look at you.
he'll start clearing it out tomorrow. --It's a shame.
he was on his way to getting me. Don't you think?
was he?
Oh, you silly man!
Yes, he's charming, yes, he's like a breath of fresh air in the village, yes, I was flattered, but...
no.
you are my husband, Len.
I would never deceive you.
unless it was for the best.
there was a single bullet wound to the back of the head, which I concluded was the cause of death.
did you fomarlly estimate the time of death, Dr Haydock?
between 6: 20 or thereabouts and 6. 40 at the latest.
thank you
I showed him in at 6: 15 and then went back to the kitchen.
he wasn't half looking pleased with himself though, like the cat that got the cream.
then I heard him give a blooming great sneeze about five minutes after, and the next time I see him, he was dead. --Very well, Miss Hill. Step down.
did you know the colonel sent her young man to prison?
Frank Tarrant.
lastly, Mrs Protheroe, can you think of anyone who might have wished your husband harm?
no. No-one at all, I'm afraid.
thank you.--Although...
Yes?--On Monday in Melchester High Street, he was nearly hit by a motorcycle.
are you suggesting this was deliberate?
it didn't seem so at the time.
I just thought I should mention it.
I find that the deceased Colonel Lucius Alexander Protheroe was murdered by a person or persons unknown.
did you wonder about the motorbike?
it was just going too fast, I thought.
he did come very close, though.
he or she. One couldn't tell.
by the way, when the colonel stayed late in Melchester on Tuesday afternoon, what was he doing?--Meeting Mrs Ross-Harkins, I think.
Hermione? The bishop's wife, and his fellow magistrate too.
inspector, please find out who did this.
if someone tried to make it look as if...
well, they must hate Lawrence and me very much, and er...
well, I'm scared.
wait.
Oh.
this was outside the French windows.
no one at the vicarage smokes.
Dennis sneaking a crafty one?--Sniff.
French. Young men on leave a long time ago they'd bring them back from France.
when Monsieur Dufosse appeared on the footpath,
I wonder if he'd only just turned into it from the woods.
look, it's easy to imagine all kinds of things after the event, but the simple fact is...--Murder is never simple.
we would be foolish, stupid, to ignore any possibility.
we?
did I say that?
so sorry.
I don't know whether to buy her a box of chocs or kick away her stick.
I'd prefer the chocolates.
how marvellous that you're not in black. It's so dreary.
should I know you?--I want you to.
who are you?--Ah."Who is Sylvia?
what is she?
let's have a little chat.
I made a walk along the footpath.
it is very beautiful.
did you go into the woods, Mr Dufosse?
no. Footpath only.
when do you go back to France?
we have missed the good connection now.
tomorrow by the first train.
I might need to get in touch with you.
what's this magazine of yours called?
you'll have to spell it.
and the bishop and his wife get back tomorrow?
would you please be kind to ask Hermione to telephone me as soon as they get back to Melchester?
Jane Marple.
it might, yes.
very important indeed.
Anne gets the hall.
but you can set up on your own.
I'll help you look for somewhere.
he's only been dead two days.--So? You hated him.
the killer did you a favour.-- Dennis!
it's true.--I'm going in.
why did you tell Miss Marple you lost your beret?
you had it at tennis.--Were you listening?
and you left before we finished the game.
and you went soon after. The gardener told me.
Yes. But you don't think I could have killed your father.
you don't think I care enough about you.
I know who did it.--There you are.
two birds, one stone.
perhaps you could tell me where you both were on Tuesday evening.
together. We played tennis.
then we went for a walk. In the woods.
Yes, the woods, rolling around over towards Much Benham. It was a smashing evening.
wasn't it?
Hello, Tony? It's Joan Hargreaves.
I need a favour. Is your place anywhere near St Mary Mead?
I left the ledgers on the desk so you'd have them to hand when the colonel arrived.
you don't think the...murderer took them?
no. I expect Mary's been moving things.
were they all in order, by the way?
Mrs Price-Ridley's pound note was counted in with the jumble sale money.
I went back over the last six months and everything balances.
as we knew it would.
lust bringeth forth sin and sin bringeth forth death.
I...I can't stay in here.
I don't know what to do.
suddenly, we just seem so...distant.
what would you like to do?
Oh...
walk away, just the two of us into a crisp and snowy morning.
then paint it.
the sneeze that Mary heard that could have been the murderer, couldn't it?
and Anne was there.
I just hope she's safe.
he is early, your friend. Good.
Bonjour.
the magazine you work for went out of business before war.
now, what have you got? the silver?
my grandson, Henri.
he would have been my husband.
we met in 1943.
he was in the Resistance.--And you, Miss Hargreaves?
special Operations.
I was dropped into France, working with Henri and his crew.
the colonel?--He commanded a desk in London.
ll a trahi Henri.
he betrayed him.-- He betrayed my grandson.
Protheroe's section was responsible for supplying the whole of our region, weapons, detonators and so on.
early in 1944, he had to organise a money drop tens of thousands of francs in cash.
Henri and I waited at the rendezvous he'd given us, but the plane went over and dropped the canister a mile away.
Why?--The rendezvous was false.
the money was picked up by a man called Lacombe, one of our group, who had known Protheroe before the war.
it was simple greed.
after the war, they divided it between them.
LaCombe and the colonel.
LaCombe made a confession to me, last year when he was dying
that's the proof: bank transfers, statements
LaCombe's instructions.
what happened to Henri?
LaCombe had tipped off the Germans and they came for us.
I escaped.
he did not. --He was tortured...until death.
my grandson.
I'm very sorry.--And so am I.
so am I. I'll tell you the truth.
I had to kill that son of a bitch, the colonel!
because of him. And so,
I got my pistol, I went to the woods, up to the vicarage, through the French windows and into the study.
Ah...--Yes, Mr Dufosse?
I was too late.
I was too damn late!
he was dead.
are you saying...?--I'm saying...
he was already dead.
thankfully.
you're quite good at this.
I've had to learn.--Oh
so, if what he told you is true, the colonel was dead by 6: 30
when Monsieur Dufosse joined the others.
only just, if the shot you heard was the murder.
do you believe him?--Yes.
but the interesting thing is what Monsieur Dufosse saw in the study.
he described the gun as having a long barrel, you know, like the old Wild West ones?
and he thought the note was a good half page long, not just a couple of lines.
that is interesting.
I don't know how reliable he is, though.
he had just come in out of bright sunlight...
and he is getting on.
you've missed a bit.
the note...
have you shown it to Mrs Protheroe?
no, actually.
she's at the vicarage now, I believe.
funeral arrangements.
neither is in his writing, not the time or the words.
I don't understand.
you're not alone at this stage of the investigation.
do you have any examples of the colonel's handwriting?
Yes, of course.
I found it yesterday under the desk.
it's not Griselda's.
it's Anne's.
should I give it to the Inspector?--No.
not just yet.
sir, can I have a word?
how very unpleasant.
the verse?
to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband.
the motorbike was stolen in the morning and dumped soon after the incident.
such a...crude and uncertain way of killing someone,
unless it was just meant to frighten him.--I, er...
I must get on with my visiting.
I can...see myself out.
we'll get back to Mrs Protheroe.
Hello, Miss Marple.
I was thinking about leaving this one.
I might come back and finish it one day.
when do you go?
I don't know. Tomorrow or the next day.
as soon as I can clean out the cottage.
back to London?
I was thinking about Ireland.
put some real distance between us.
you'll find a new life in time.
but Anne won't, will she?--I'll do my best for her.
she's a good friend.
thank you. Thank you for everything.
you've been crying?
pot and kettle, dear.
I have some things to discuss.
not very clever to use your scented notepaper.
where are people's standards? That's what worries me.
this young man Mrs Clement was seen with in Melchester...
miss Hartnell said he was rather handsome and he gave her flowers.
I'm sure there's an innocent explanation, but even so, really, Marjorie...
I'm so ashamed, Jane.
what would Bruce think of me? And Andrew?
that you sometimes get very lonely.
Yes.--And Anne Protheroe's standards...
of course, you weren't to know the colonel had been murdered when you telephoned her at my cottage, but even so, it put her in a difficult position when she went over there.
that wasn't me!
when's the funeral?--Tuesday afternoon.
Ah. I'm in London all morning.
I hope the trains are better than last Tuesday.
I had to cadge a lift back.--The day of the murder?
chaos. Not a single train to St Mary Mead the whole afternoon.
every time we tell a lie...
we are offending God.
the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.
who can know it?
well, God can.
he sees into our hearts and searches them, to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.
let us, then, keep our hearts pure so we may say with Paul, "I have lived in all good conscience before God.
Oh, bad luck.--It wasn't luck.
someone stabbed my tyre.
such a violent thing to do.
with everything that's been going on, I'm...
I'm terrified, Mr Redding.
well, I'll walk you to your digs if you'd like.
Oh, yes, please. Would you?--Bless you.
thank you.
yes?
I want to live in all good conscience.
may I introduce you to my mother?
I know. I know I'm not a good advertisement for motherhood.
I don't want an advertisement.
why did the colonel divorce you, may I ask?
I had a...tiny, tiny fling.
I like parties and people, but Lucius wanted to clip my wings.
he offered me an allowance in return...
in return for never seeing me again.
until now.It's taken me six years since my second husband died to get my courage up.
dutch courage, mostly.
I'm not very proud of myself.
you're here now, Mother.
I thought you were dead.
never mind the hearts and flowers.
look, when Protheroe came to your room...
we have a witness. Were you trying to blackmail him?
Lord, no! I'm very well set up.
no. I just told him I wanted to see lovely daughter Lettice.
she's going to reform me.
you're all I've got.--She sees me in a cottage, baking jam and knitting...things.
as long as we can have an occasional cruise, dear.
Lettice...
may I have a private word?
it's Anne's.--It was under the desk where your father was murdered.
I knew it was her. Tell the police.
did you put it there when you were pretending to look for your beret?
she wasn't wearing those earrings on the day of the murder.
wasn't she?--Oh, Lettice, it's me.
all right, but I don't see what difference it makes, Miss Marple.
she killed him somehow so she could get her hands on Lawrence.
Lettice...--What?
the red paint on your dress was new, wasn't it?
you'd just been in the shed.
so? I heard you all coming and I had to hide.
I must have brushed against something.
it was magenta, anyway.
the colour of passion, Lawrence says.
you know, Hermione, I'll have to tell the police.
thank you, dear.
when the colonel kept his appointment at the vicarage, he had just learnt that Mr Hawes left his last parish under a cloud.
the bishop kept it from the vicar to give him another chance
what had he done?--Fiddled the accounts.
Ronnie's tried to kill himself.
dr Haydock's there and he's found a statement from Colonel Protheroe accusing him...
accusing him of stealing?--Yes.
I owe you a box of chocs.
nothing gets past you, Miss Marple, does it?
hardly ever.
nothing gets past you, Miss Marple, does it?
hardly ever, young man.
how clever!
how wicked!
the gas was full on, and that much sedative would have put him to sleep quickly.
another few minutes and he would have cheated the hangman.
note of conversation today regarding Ronald Hawes curate of St Mary Mead.
previous embezzlement of funds...It's all here.
Monsieur Dufosse said the note he saw was longer.
the accounts. He told me he'd left them in the study.
lawrence Redding can tell us his state of mind.
the landlady said he came in with him and stayed talking.
running well now, isn't she?--Ooh.
I've got it, Inspector.
Lettice was right.
Anne Protheroe did kill her husband.
Anne and Lawrence Redding.
they made themselves the obvious suspects by ensuring their secret was out, knowing that if their plan worked
they would later appear above suspicion
Oh!--I forgot you were coming.
which, of course, he had not, and Anne Protheroe chose the Toby Jug just for a change
mr Redding wasn't trying to run the colonel down
he knew it would help them muddy the waters when Anne mentioned it at the inquest.
bloody fool!--Oh!
they were making sure I'd be a captive audience for their little charade in a ringside seat
he must have had his gun with him then and a silencer
Monsieur Dufosse, remember, spoke of a long barrel.
mr Redding in the study.
it's the right decision.
have you told her?--I need to find the words.
then, he made two telephone calls, the first to get the vicar out of the way by pretending to be Mr Abbot's neighbour
Mary, old Mr Abbot at Lower Farm his neighbour's telephoned to say he's very poorly again.
the second to my cottage.
St Mary Mead 235.
we're all set, darling.
it was for me. Sorry.
she knew I'd see she couldn't possibly have a gun with her when she went into the vicarage at 20 past six
which was when you shot your husband.
coffee and cake, you said, when you telephoned.
Where's Lawrence.
under arrest by now.
the loud sneeze that Mary heard at 6: 20
was your silenced pistol
mr Redding, fired by Mrs Protheroe.
the shot at 6: 30 had me puzzled, until Miss Marple found what she did.
it didn't come from the woods or from the house
it came from the shed.
so she goes off with the Dufosses and you go to the Blue Boar
a large one. I've had a hell of a day.
then you return to the vicarage on the pretext of seeing Mr Clement again knowing he wouldn't be back from his wild-goose chase.
wait in the study with the colonel.
he's here?--He is.
you remove the murder weapon and leave a forged note with deliberate mistakes.
different handwriting in different inks on vicarage notepaper you'd taken previously.
a shock to find a statement from the colonel but it might come in useful
you reset the clock knowing it was fast all to make us think Mrs Protheroe was being falsely implicated in her husband's murder
and the colonel's statement did come in useful last night, didn't it?
as you now had evidence of a motive, enough to frame Mr Hawes for the murder.
Oh, bad luck.
calm down, Ronnie. I'll mix your medicine...
and turn on the gas as you drift away and leave the colonel's note by the body.
but murder, Anne?
for a stranger who reminded you of what might have been?
he wasn't a stranger.
but I was right when I said that nothing was ever the same again
it was Lawrence who didn't come back from the fighting...
except that he did four years after he'd been reported dead, and by then, I was Mrs Protheroe.
he found you?
he was too decent to try when he heard I'd married.
I found him.
a magazine article about the rising young artist back from the dead.
what did we do wrong?
you ask me that?
what mistake did we make?
when you came out of the shed with him you were the same woman.
you hadn't said goodbye forever to the man you loved.
you could tell that?--You think I've never...
I lost someone in the war...
who got a medal for dying.
his wife will have cherished it.
his wife?
easier for you, then, Jane.
he was dead.
you didn't have to choose between right and wrong.
when you volunteered, darling you made a choice to do your duty.
Yes.--I've had to make a choice too.
I've chosen to do my duty.
come back safe, but for your wife, not for me.
Jane...
please, if I can't come back for you, then there's...
Jane!
Jane!
Lawrence! Lawrence!
it's the apricot chutney with fish stew that gave me inkling
when did you find out?
my cousin called this morning to confirm it.
of course!
he's that doctor in Melchester, isn't he?
rather a handsome young man.
I didn't want to see Dr Haydock.
well, you know village gossip.
and I wanted to be sure first.
she told me she'd gone to London.
I never suspected a thing.
our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
thy kingdom come.
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread. forgive us our trespasses.
as we forgive those who trespass against us.
and lead us not into temptation.
but deliver us from evil.
they took Lieutenant Torres, and I have to get him back.
he's dead.
where can I find my brother, sir? - You shut up, Evan!
Randall Kersey. They followed him, boss.
I pushed as hard as I could to get away, and...
that's when Lieutenant Torres went down?
I know what I saw!
post-traumatic stress is a complicated disorder.
something happened to me that night, Agent Gibbs.
Torres was never dragged away, it was one of my men in the ambush.
I was back in Arghanda all over again.
and I was convinced that that guy on the tape was there.
McGee: I. J.I. It means something to Captain Westcott.
find out why.
after-action Report of the Arghanda ambush
ID'd the group responsible, the Ijil Rebels.
Randall Kersey really was fighting with the enemy.
what is that? - A building blueprint.
looks like our John Walker Lindh was planning something.
not was. Is.
find him.
Oh, no! See that, McCartney?
Aw, you losing to yourself again?
no, man. She's looking at me.
Yeah. With her sexy little robe, and her big ol' bedroom eyes.
Oh, yeah.
this girl wants me bad.
are we going on patrol tonight, Captain Westcott?
well, if Hall can tear himself away from his new girlfriend.
sir, she's got nothing on my Sara.
before I left, her belly was out to here, but my Sara was still...
the prettiest girl in the Sunshine State.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
my baby girl wants to be a ballerina?
daddy's gonna buy her a tutu.
she wants to play football?
daddy's gonna teach her how to throw a spiral.
move! Move! Move! Move!
captain!
daddy.
looks good on me, huh, Captain?
captain! Captain!
captain Westcott?
sir?
you were right about Kersey being in Arghanda.
with the enemy?
Yeah, he's planning something here.
gone off-grid.
we need your help to go find him.
sorry, Agent Gibbs, but I don't think I have anything else for you.
you had contact with Kersey here and in Afghanistan.
any detail could give us something.
he talk to anyone at the convenience store?
no. But it didn't seem like he was there for a pack of gum, either.
I tried to track everything he was doing, but... it was too much.
the After-Action Report says that you and Torres were inside enemy headquarters during the ambush.
honestly, sir, I only put that in there because Torres said we were inside.
I don't...
I only remember the ambush in pieces, and that's not one of them.
anyone else file a report?
no, I was the C. O. Far as Kersey, uh... I clocked him deep into the ambush.
he was attempting to capture PFC Hall.
but I didn't see anything else.
any of your other men see him?
there was only one other man in the area: McCartney.
uh, I'm sorry.
his-his real name is Paul Patterson.
moved back home after he got out.
virginia, I think.
this kid, superhuman.
okay, Captain, you up for taking a little trip tomorrow?
maybe the two of you can put your heads together.
he'll do whatever you need, Agent Gibbs.
no doubt, sir.
look, I know you need to get well.
and I won't keep you any longer than I have to.
it is a little cramped in here.
be glad to get you guys another room if it'll help.
you feel like you need watching, son?
no, sir.
but if you want to stay...
Oh, no. I need to get back to Ohio.
come on, a few more days won't hurt.
what? - You heard what he said; he said he's okay.
got it.
no, I need to get back to work.
this time of year is brutal.
I'd like someone here.
I'll stay.
what do you mean it's sold out?
no, no.
it has to be Saturday night.
Yes, it has to be the opera.
okay, do not tell me that I'm out of luck, because I think it's...
fine.
big three of romantic dates: beach picnic, impromptu dancing in the rain and the opera.
so who is he?
he is no one.
you're serious about this guy?
I'm serious about my guy. Where's Kersey?
uh, current location still unknown.
bolo went out wide.
neighbors last saw him driving a blue sedan.
still looking for the plate numbers, but there's nothing with wheels registered to his name.
background?
Randall J. Kersey. 25 years old. Born in the City of Angels.
he started a degree in Philosophy at the University of Maine, but a semester abroad in India sent him in another direction.
Yeah, the terrorist direction.
hooked up with the Ijil Rebels somewhere along the border, then he followed the pied piper across Pakistan, into Afghanistan.
CIA only knew him by his Muslim name: Sulayman al-Janfi.
they did not connect that name to Kersey.
contacts?
no living relatives, but he does list a girlfriend by the name of Brooke Fenten as an emergency contact.
you were right, boss.
Abby confirmed that the paper found in Kersey's basement was part of a building blueprint.
does she know which building?
not yet.
but she did say the explosive remnants suggest that Kersey likely has two IEDs.
probably small in size, but they'll pack a big punch.
must be quite the building he's got his heart set on.
talk to the girlfriend.
girlfriend experience coming up.
more than happy to wait here, sir.
so, where'd the nickname come from?
as in Paul.
he had this old guitar.
there was always music coming out of this kid.
crazy what that kind of thing means over there.
good guy to have around.
he was the one.
thanks to McCartney, Hall died looking at us instead of them.
Patterson. You okay?
what are you doing here?
this is Agent Gibbs from NCIS.
Yeah, look, I heard about what happened to Torres, and that's really sad, but I hardly needed in-person notification, okay?
look, McCartney, can we just come in... - It's Patterson. What do you want?
you recognize him?
this guy was in Arghanda.
he was there that night firing on us. Do you remember him?
no. - He grabbed Hall.
he was one of the ones that you... - I said no!
you know, I was actually having a pretty good day today.
like, what the hell are you doing here? Huh?
where were you before?
I needed you before.
this... this I don't need.
bringing you here, that was my idea.
it's, uh... it's on me. That's my bad.
captain! Captain!
captain, this must be their base.
captain! Captain!
come on, Hall.
captain, stop!
Joe, it's me.
I remember the headquarters!
captain W. Abby Sciuto. I'm here to help.
you must be Sergeant W.
Yeah. - I love brothers.
I just found my second one at this animal rescue... - Abbs.
okay. Based on your After-Action Report,
I was able to whip up our very own version of the Arghanda ambush using
ta-da!-- virtual reality.
I'm more of a Super Mario guy myself.
well, since VR is being used to treat soldiers with PTS,
I think this will be better for your memory.
and it could help us find Kersey.
this, uh, Kersey's blueprint?
uh, yeah, well, the watermark led me directly to the U. S. Register of Historic Buildings.
so I'm comparing your piece to all the registered blueprints.
but I haven't had a happy little ding yet.
speaking of happy little dings, what's your oven situation for Thanksgiving?
cause I need, like, 40 minutes for my Aunt Gertie's caffeinated green bean casserole.
but I'm really excited that you're letting us just invite ourselves over...
Abbs. - Uh, Lady Lab Coat, my brother just turned this thing on.
it was him, he did it.
no, you did it. - Excuse me.
here we go.
okay, this is Lady Lab Coat, and I'm just gonna walk you through what we have.
you and your men are on foot patrol, and you see some gear inside an abandoned building.
you and Lieutenant Torres move inside.
this is crazy.
that's the headquarters?
Yeah, and your brother's gonna help me fill it in.
I saw a table... with a computer.
uh, some kind of satellite modem.
and the wall was covered...
...with documents, pictures, maps.
that's when I saw Ijil.
I saw a picture of Kersey.
clean-cut, like on his driver's license.
plans for his mission here?
could be, that's... that's all I got.
okay, well, let's, uh, move on then, to the ambush.
move, move!
it might be worth getting to the end.
no, I know how it ends.
maybe we can take a walk and try... - Damn it, Evan.
damn it.
look, Agent Gibbs, that's... I-I gave you all I got.
I'm done.
I'm sorry, good luck.
you're right-- straight to voice mail.
Yeah, so, when was the last time you saw him?
ms. Fenten, when was the last time you saw Mr. Kersey?
he's not on chat, either.
I mean, he's always on chat.
even when he's at my place, he's on my laptop on chat.
okay. So, who's he chatting with?
um, phone people-- he works at Bilson.
they're always helping each other with tech questions.
I can't believe he's not on chat.
well, like I told you, he's got a few things going on.
so, when was the last time you saw Mr. Kersey?
um, yeah, sorry. It was this morning.
he came over to say good-bye.
he said his business trip got moved up to today.
so, where was he going?
he was flying to Houston, but from there he was going all over.
maybe even India.
they were rolling out this new...
he was lying?
we've been together eight months.
I thought I knew him.
we're gonna need your laptop, check out his chats.
Yeah, of course, it's at my apartment.
and, uh, do you know anything about a blue sedan?
well, that sounds like his car.
fantastic, you got the plates?
I think it ends with a nine... - or a six.
um, sorry.
well, maybe you could find it through his uncle's name.
Randy's uncle left him that car when he died last year.
what's the uncle's name?
Kersey's only uncle, Daniel Kersey, died in 1989.
so, Randy lied to his girlfriend about where he got the car.
got her permission to keep an eye on her communications but it's doubtful he'll contact her.
bolo? - No hits.
not surprising without a license plate.
we went back to the convenience store like you suggested, and the manager remembers Kersey but nothing fishy.
e-mail, cell phone, credit cards--all inactive.
he knows we're on to him.
search area, McGee?
despite what Kersey told his girlfriend, he did not fly out this morning.
all airports, train stations and borders were secured and monitored beginning last night.
well, if he's behind the wheel, making minimal stops, driving the speed limit to avoid being pulled over, could be anywhere inside that 400-mile radius.
lot of places to hide.
you know, the girlfriend's computer might help narrow it down.
she said Kersey used it to chat up coworkers.
as a field technician, he had direct access to phone lines.
Tim. - On it, boss.
what about us?
figure out where to look for a guy who knows we're looking for him.
Ah, just in time for The Ballad of Randall J. Kersey.
it's a tragedy, I'm afraid.
Yeah, always is.
young Randall lost his parents to a car accident when he was just five years old.
bounced from one foster home to the next ran away from six of the eight.
he give a reason?
after each escape, he was recovered from the home of one of his classmates, begging the parents to let him stay.
he wanted a permanent family.
Yeah, well, like many terrorists organizations, the Ijil foster unshakeable bonds.
now that Randall Kersey has had a taste of such belonging, to return to a solitary life would be a sacrilege.
you think he's got help.
precisely. Where is he?
we're trying to find that out now, Duck.
no, I meant where is Captain Westcott, other than at the forefront of your mind?
uh, he's headed home.
doc okayed me getting into the ambush and then I pushed.
pushed too hard.
well, it's obvious that you feel a grave responsibility towards this young man.
Ducky, I sent home plenty of marines like Westcott, and-and I knew their heads weren't right.
I hoped that there would be someone on the other side to catch them.
you had no choice.
I mean, you had to stay behind. It was your duty.
I'm on the other side now.
I tried to catch Westcott.
I didn't. He wouldn't let me.
and when do you take "no" for an answer?
I'm angry, Ducky.
you can't fix the world, Jethro.
but you can call the boy.
Hello?
Hey, it's Gibbs.
Hey, Agent Gibbs. - Where are you?
you knew that he was on meds and you bring him here?
Hey, hey, hey, don't worry about it.
what, let me guess, you're a scotch man-- can you get him a scotch, neat, please?
you got it. - Come on, let's go, bud.
back off.
you're not my father.
he'd never come and check in on me.
he's always got better things to do, right?
wait, hey, hey, sit down... the flight doesn't leave till noon.
come on, man, let's get out of here.
you taking his side?
there are no sides here.
what are you doing taking his side, you're my brother.
Yeah, which is why I've let you beat on me last three days straight for no reason.
Oh, no, I got a reason.
mm, good, let's talk about it in the car, then.
you don't get what I've been through.
so don't try to act like you do. - I just got back from over there.
it's different.
I was in it out there, same as you, I saw guys die... - It's different!
how is it different?! It's the same damn thing!
come on, that's enough.
enough!
sit down.
it's different because you're okay.
back up.
sorry.
McGee, you're here early.
been here all night.
combing through Kersey's chats is a bigger job than I thought.
I swear, if I got to read one more thing about a malfunctioning VoIP system.
did you find anything?
chats are clean, just looking for any files he might have saved.
we're giving Kersey more hiding places by the minute.
Yup.
Hey, speaking of places, I hear you're going to the opera.
no, I'm not going to the opera, and that was the worst segue ever.
I know, it was forced.
Tony made me promise to ask you about it.
it's unbelievable, why can't he just leave it alone?
well, I think he thinks you're pretty serious about this guy.
I mean, the opera is one of the big three.
why can't you just leave it alone?
leave what alone?
what did I miss?
did you ask her?
Tony? - Did you tell him?
no. - Bingo.
what?
bingo is right, McVoyeur.
she's smoking in those shorts.
my Lord, there is something about a good strong ponytail, isn't there?
Tony, the car.
ladies and gentlemen, we have a plate.
stellar work, McGee, just, uh, shoot it over to me and I'll add it to the BOLO.
did she say anything?
leave it alone, Tony.
agent Gibbs, I signed off on you exploring the ambush for good reason.
the only way to stop a traumatic event from taking over your life is to face it.
doc, the kid is trying.
and failing, I'm sure.
even with regular therapy at home, the healing process is going to be rocky.
what about his recent encounter with Mr. Kersey?
asked him, got flustered, said there's too many details.
hypervigilance, re-experiencing, they're both symptoms.
he spots Kersey, and he's overwhelmed.
he sees everything around him as a threat.
would it help to get him back in the store?
retracing his steps could help him isolate what's important.
I'm not asking about the case. I'm asking about what would help Westcott.
I-I'm sorry, is there a problem?
well, yeah, Doc, there's a problem.
you served, right? - Iraq.
okay, then you know.
kids are going over and we're expecting them to come back the same.
the experience changes everyone.
what are we doing?
agent Gibbs... - What are we doing?
agent Gibbs, I would raise my hand all over again.
Yeah, so would I, so would Westcott.
but he is blaming himself for not doing more.
how do I help him?
two objectives in the treatment of PTS: rediscover sense of purpose, rebuild trust.
look, I get it.
you show up here, you offer me some ice cream and a balloon to stick around.
but I'm sorry, sir. I can't accept
case isn't closed. I still need your help.
I'm not staying in this room another day.
okay, then you can bunk with me.
rocky Road's in the freezer.
you're hilarious.
Yeah, I know. Get in the car.
see you at home, kid.
tell your dad I'm sorry about Thanksgiving.
you know, that was the first fight we've ever been in where we weren't on the same side.
look, I don't know what I was thinking letting him drink.
you weren't thinking.
it happens.
I knew it was wrong, but for a minute, I... He was himself.
you know, I had my old brother back.
find a way to love the brother you got.
try to get him to sleep, will you?
Yeah. You staying?
Yeah, we'll go back together.
whenever he's ready. - Okay.
can't believe the old bird just let you shut the place down so I could concentrate.
amazing what happens when you don't give the bird a choice.
you are a badass, Agent Gibbs.
okay, Captain, you're on.
no harm at all if we come out of here with nothing.
right.
all right, uh, I was right here, Lieutenant Torres was to my left.
and, uh... I, uh...
I first spotted Kersey at my one o'clock.
he's shifty. He picks up a can of soup, but he doesn't look at it.
it's just for show.
the bell rings.
and it's a girl with blue hair.
Torres is telling me that we gotta go.
come on, man. Let's get out of here. He's the wrong guy.
Hey, stay with Kersey.
he's on the move.
you got a problem, old man?
what are you looking at?
come on, Joe, let's go, man! Let's go!
let the rest go.
just Kersey.
it was a handoff.
that's good work.
you badass.
Hey, boss, sketch artist said Westcott gave her a good amount of detail.
that's some hairdo.
she shouldn't be hard to spot.
so we're thinking straight line from the Blue Bonnet to Kersey?
she knows something. Find out what.
now would be nice.
right. BOLO.
DiNozzo! - Yeah, boss?
taking it to the streets. Thanks.
change of plans.
Kersey's car just got spotted by state police on the G. W. Parkway.
tell the police no one goes in till we get there.
the whole grid, he's still on the Parkway?
NCIS! Keep your hands on the steering wheel!
hands, Kersey! Hands!
get out of the car. - Keep your hands up!
please don't shoot me!
Where's Kersey? - I don't know.
car's clear, boss.
superbad here is all alone.
when did you last see him? Where was he?
uh, yesterday Rock Creek Park.
um, he said I should get out of town right away, but I was so stoked to have the car, that I...
he paid me 200 bucks to take it and keep driving.
please don't shoot me.
talk to me.
Kersey's whereabouts still unknown.
Ziva's talking to his hired driver.
since he ditched the car, we're probably looking for something stolen.
kid puts him in Rock Creek Park yesterday at 12: 30 p. m.
that would adjust the radius to...
no, that's where he wants us to look.
the bigger, the better.
boss?
shut it down.
Kersey was working a plan, he got spooked.
a little visit to Interrogation sent him running?
no, he's not running. Underground.
he wanted us to follow the car while he stuck to his plan.
he's still in the neighborhood.
Kersey's driver does not know anything.
he's a runaway living on the streets.
parents are addicts.
I do not understand why Kersey's using these children.
it's better for him if we pick up some kid who doesn't know anything.
kids who want to belong, like he did.
he knows how to talk to them.
DiNozzo. Blue hair?
canvass was a bust.
convenience store manager was a little more helpful.
no name, but said that Marge Simpson is a regular.
you two, go.
don't come back without her.
Hey, Gibbs, um, I heard McGee say that he would like to spend more quality time with Tony.
so I thought, how about a "boys only" stakeout?
I pointed to you and DiNozzo.
Hey, cut the guy some slack, will ya?
it's the opera.
one of the big three.
let's go!
looked through this a few times, but nothing rings a bell.
my couch is a good bed.
Yeah, I can't sleep.
I had a girl that smiled like that when I stood next to her.
she, uh, wrote me letters, she kept me going.
and when I got back, I... I cheated on her.
I really loved that girl.
truth is, he and I... we're no different.
we run.
and we take down everybody else along the way.
you're nothing like him.
Torres was... - Gone when he hit the pavement.
there's nothing you could've done.
but Hall, Hall was different.
he needed me, and I just, I ran.
westcott... you're alive. You survived.
for what? This?
my dad won't even look at me.
I can't even look at my brother.
this thing is just, it's just... it's eating me alive.
even Patterson.
that kid was Superman, and now he...
the only way to beat this is to keep on fighting.
and it wouldn't hurt to let the rest of us have a few whacks from time to time.
Yeah, well, I think the sun is officially up, so let me be the first to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving.
gobble, gobble.
how about the boss playing the big host this year?
turkey legs by the fire.
shut up!
I'm sick of you sitting in this car being nice to me.
my deepest apologies.
you're only being nice because you want me to tell you what you want to know.
then tell me and I'll stop being nice.
there's nothing to tell.
fine. I'll make it up.
he's a veterinarian!
stop raising your voice.
I can't be nice, I might as well be loud. Does he make you laugh?
you're such a child.
and then you wonder why I cannot talk to you.
so, he's a hilarious veterinarian who likes the opera.
why do you care?
I thought we were past caring about these things!
past them?
look, I don't care who this guy is.
I just thought we were, you know, telling each other things about things.
the things that... you know, matter.
Tony, there is no funny veterinarian.
there is no one, actually.
only Tali.
your sister?
I think about her every day, but this week is... this week is the most difficult.
it's when you lost her?
it's a birthday.
tomorrow, actually.
tali used to sing Puccini, and even my father's eyes would get filled with tears.
you know, her dream was to be on stage.
so every year on her birthday, I go to the opera in honor of her.
but this year, this year was...
it's sold out. - Yes.
and I know it sounds really... silly, but I feel like I'm...
like I'm letting her down, and...
the love of a sibling is...
well, I'm lucky, lucky to have known it.
got her.
what do you want?
NCIS. We need to talk.
look, I didn't do nothing.
lay off the double-negatives. They confuse her.
Randall Kersey. Where is he?
what are you asking about him for?
why don't you tell us?
it's just some guy.
come and bring us food sometimes.
you know, odd jobs to make money.
he was nice.
he handed you something inside this store last Saturday night.
a piece of paper. What was it?
instructions.
he didn't talk details in person.
but, look, the jobs were never anything bad.
you know what we're gonna ask you next.
we met at this coffee shop sometimes.
that note said I should be there today at 10: 00.
Why?
he was gonna give me some box to drop off at Union Station.
it was nothing bad.
that's my girl.
on time as always.
now, you know where this is going...
...but I'd like to know when it's done.
I think we're pretty much done right now.
I'm sorry to cut your holiday plans short, Mr. Kersey.
Where's the other one?
we know there's two.
there's nothing at the train station.
so where did you send it?
who are you working with?
some other kid you bought?
what... What, that's it?
Where's he going?!
guy actually has a conscience.
Gibbs is gonna take a hammer to it.
you know, boss doesn't let too many people back here.
he asked, and I said yes.
it's closure.
private Christopher Gomez.
Nineteen.
left behind two little brothers and a mother.
the mom says that he took care of everyone.
killed in action by the Ijil Rebels.
you're not just killing blank faces, Randall.
Where's the bomb?
corporal Troy Baroni.
22 years old.
Gibbs has him.
those are my men.
you okay?
coward won't even look at them.
look at them!
look at him.
private First Class James Hall.
wife waiting at home, pregnant with a baby girl.
you remember him?! No one else needs to get hurt!
where is the bomb, Kersey?!
Where's the bomb?!
my name... is Sulayman al-Janfi.
the Ijil are my brothers.
today, I failed them.
but that night, I got one more savage than I thought.
you son of a bitch!
say his name! Get off him!
you say his name! You say his name!
get off me! Let him go! Get off him!
private First Class James Hall! Private First Class James Hall!
get him off me!
she was in the headquarters on the wall! She's part of it!
who? - His girlfriend!
doing fine. Dorneget dropped him off with his brother.
let's go.
Brooke Fenten, age 29. Never been to Afghanistan.
ponytail played us.
said the car came from the uncle.
told Kersey what was up, he hired a driver.
she threw his chats in my face.
I hate her, no matter how good she looks in those shorts.
it is unclear how she is linked to the Ijil, but...
I don't care. Skip it. Where is she now?
uh, well, didn't answer her cell, nobody's home.
McGee. - Work schedule on her computer has her catering a Thanksgiving event tonight.
where? - Still working on it. No address listed.
Gibbs! Gibbs! Gibbs! - Gibbs trifecta. Nice.
I finally got a match on the blueprint from Kersey's basement.
it was on the historic register.
this home belongs to Senator Geoffrey Roberts.
boss, Senator Roberts is hosting the members of the Joint Economic Committee and their families for Thanksgiving.
it's all over the news.
take a big bite out of Congress with one hit.
saddle up.
event security has to be U. S. Capitol Police.
call on the way.
Abbs, get me the address.
okay, but... you'll be back by turkey time, right?
device?
in the kitchen-- it was found in one of the food storage bins.
bomb squad already has it disarmed, but...
boss, they lost Fenten.
do we know she was here?
multiple witnesses saw her at the party.
no sightings after the police entered.
her staff doesn't know anything. They all look clean.
roadblocks are out.
she's got to be on foot.
boss. I found this stuffed in a closet.
she could be hiding inside the house.
no, she always had a plan to get out.
I'm glad you came back.
I, uh... saw what happened through the window.
um... I wanted to come out, but... - Oh, I don't blame you.
I'm... I must've looked like a deranged Forrest Gump out here.
my head's messed up, McCartney.
it-it sucks saying that, but...
maybe you should think about talking to someone, too.
see about picking up that guitar again.
Yeah, I don't know if I have it in me.
you already ran head-on at the enemy once.
Yeah, you got it in you.
he means how you got Hall and brought him back to us.
what? N... That... that wasn't me, Captain.
that was you.
captain! Captain!
captain!
okay, okay, I'm here.
come on, Hall. Come on.
I didn't run away.
you didn't run.
forgive yourself for the rest.
I just wish it would've mattered.
the general never ran from anything.
it mattered.
to us.
are you heading over?
Yeah.
Abby was so excited Gibbs moved Thanksgiving to tonight.
listen, I told the boss that, uh, you're gonna be a little late.
come on, Tony, you've seen me drive.
I'm never late.
did you know that McGee installed a crazy surround sound system in here?
I came in one night, and he was playing video games wearing a cape.
I know it's not the same, but...
maybe if you closed your eyes, it'd be like you were at the opera.
and maybe even like...
tali's there with you.
thank you.
worst houseguest ever, by the way.
turns out, it wasn't George Michael at all.
according to my brother Nate, it's because I've got an inoperable brain aneurysm.
it's bad news, right?
well, maybe not.
like anything, it depends who you ask.
you ask an allegedly mystical, allegedly Chinese acupuncturist, it means that I could be some kind of modern day prophet, because, hey, if god wants to send a message out, who else to send but George Michael, right?
now my assistant just thinks I'm crazy, but my friend thinks these visions are a sign that I need to somehow, uh, change my life and start using my legal skills to make the world a better place and blah, blah, blah...
and that's what I promised my dad I'd do 20 years ago, and even though he's been dead for ten of them, there are some promises you have to keep.
anyway, that's what I'm doing with this coffee can.
see, I promised my dead father, with whom I share the same brain aneurysm and potentially prophetic abilities, that I would dispose of his ashes here in the Himalayas, which I did.
now I just want to bring the can home.
mules often use coffee to disguise the scent of the drugs they transport.
Yeah, but I'm not even transporting coffee. See? See?
this doesn't look like coffee to me.
no. No.
that -- that would be my dad.
look, this is crazy.
that guy -- he just got two live chickens through.
suspected contraband can't leave the country.
I'm sorry.
I'm not letting you on the plane with that can.
well, "what's left of dad," looks like this good-bye.
will you do me a favor?
if there really is somebody up there, would you ask him to please just leave me alone for this week?
better yet, just make it a month.
and please, no more visions.
Eli stone's office. Please hold.
Eli stone's office. Please hold.
Oh, baby, I's -- are you okay?
Oh, Stone Eli's office.
Oh, look, just call me back later.
Eli stone's office.
Yes, I know he's supposed to be back today.
no, I don't know where he is, but when he gets here, I've got dibs on killing him.
could you sign for this delivery?
just put it on the desk.
here, I don't think these are gonna fit.
he better have shipped himself back one of those.
Hey, my crates arrived.
what did you do, bring back the great wall of china?
I was in the Himalayas, and my trip was great.
thank you. Don't I get a hug?
you get one at Christmas.
Patti, the grumpier you are, the more I know you missed me.
here. I bought you a gift.
my boss has a nervous breakdown, and all I get is this lousy -- what is this?
that is a saraswati -- the Hindu goddess of wisdom.
how does it work?
do I hit you in the head with it, and then you come back to your senses?
my senses are fine.
they're better than fine.
two blissful song - free weeks, Patti.
I didn't even hear muzak in an elevator.
everything's back to normal, and it's gonna stay that way.
well, does that mean we're done suing the firm and risking our jobs?
Yeah, and even if we weren't, I got a piece of paper saying they can't fire me.
what does the paper say about not firing me?
I thought so.
Eli stone's office. Please hold.
also pleased to announce we'll be acquiring Hutchins, Wheeler & Dittmar as our new London branch.
and welcome back, Mr. Stone, newly returned from his
nervous breakdown.
sabbatical.
thank you. It's good to be back, and, uh, when I say "back," I mean, "back" -- in the fullest sense of the, um...
well, no more suing the firm, basically.
and we're all grateful for that.
next item, United states vs. Solinksy, et al.
sir, I found some precedent in the library that's on point with the United states case
if you're referring to Allston V. Beckridge, that's a second circuit case, not ninth.
anyway, I footnod it in my pretrial memo.
you haven't been assigned this case yet, Mr. Dowd.
that's an encouraging word, that "yet."
yet Mr. Dowd is already very busy with Hanson.
which will be finished by the time Solinsky starts.
whereas another associate might be better rested and coming off a $5. 2 million win.
true enough.
Mr. Stone, the case is yours.
come see me in my office later to share your thoughts on it.
next item, Ramirez, et al vs. Gro Plus farms?
Oh, that's, um, mine, sir. Maggie dekker.
it's a workers' comp claim I brought in.
country's third largest food manufacturer -- how did you manage to retain them?
I haven't.
actually, we'd be representing the worker seeking compensation.
well, unfortunately, or from my perspective, fortunately, it's policy not to allow first year associates to take on new matters, so
I know.
I thought that this case might be in Mr. Stone's particular wheelhouse.
unwinnable cases aren't a wheelhouse.
anyway, I'll be too busy with Solinksy. Pass.
Oh, but I thought
I'll pass. Thanks.
very well.
moving on, I understand we've filed a 12 - b - 6 in dolan.
you got to make it stop. The music -- it's back.
Dr. Chen with patient now.
you get manners. Come back later.
I need to talk to you right now.
sign outside say "in session," not "Eli bother dr. Chen all time."
it's important.
very sorry. This patient impatient.
you sleep five minute.
dude, that is so not cool.
no, not cool is hearing a choir during your monday morning staff meeting.
makes sense.
choral music originated with ambrosian hymnography in the fourth century.
I didn't come here for a theology seminar.
I came here so you could stick me with a needle so that my life can stop providing its own soundtrack.
what was the choir singing?
I don't know, and I don't care.
I was supposed to be done with all this.
I took the case. I won the case.
I took my dad's ashes. I went to the Himalayas.
now it's supposed to be over.
I need it to be over.
it doesn't work that way, Eli.
how does it work then?
well, I don't know.
I never had a patient who could be a prophet before.
stop saying I'm a prophet.
well, okay, but for the record, that's exactly what a prophet might say.
I don't want to be a prophet, okay?
I want to be a lawyer -- a good one, the one I used to be.
now you gonna help me or not?
just chill.
do exactly what you did last time -- follow the signs.
if things get really bad, come see me.
I'll give you a little needle action.
and next time you barge in like that, bro, I'm billing you for the session.
okay.
God.
what is that smell?
it's the candle.
it's, uh, it's made from yak hooves.
it's -- it's supposed to be an aphrodisiac.
or not.
Taylor, it -- it's been two weeks since we
it's been over two weeks.
last time we tried, it was George Michael interrupts.
don't worry. He's doing a concert in the Maldives.
cute, but we both know George Michael was caused by the brain aneurysm we're not talking about.
Yeah, I'm not talking about it with anyone.
I'm trying to keep this thing quiet.
have you had any more episodes?
what, like hearing a choir?
anything.
no. No episodes.
I'm perfectly fine.
if I engage in strenuous physical activity with you without a discussion establishing informed consent,
I could be held civilly, or worse, criminally liable for whatever happens.
you know how it turns me on when you talk all lawyer - like.
even more than yak hooves?
Yeah, a lot more than yak hooves.
what is it?
it's nothing.
it's nothing at all.
Eli, what's going on?
uh, it's nothing.
first George Michael and now a boys' choir?
I'm a little worried about where this might be going.
Yeah, less joking, more doctoring, Nate.
uh, just out of curiosity, what song were they singing?
if you must know, "freedom."
they were singing "freedom."
so you're not being chased by George Michael anymore, just his catalog.
I got a ticking time bomb in my brain, and my brother's making jokes.
not just making jokes.
I'm sending out your case for consults.
I'm trading e-mails with the mayo clinic and the walton center and tiantan puhua, even.
what do they say? - Given the location of the aneurysm, surgery is a bad idea.
well, define "bad."
possible loss of motor skills.
you could end up a vegetable.
I'm assuming my odds go up if someone more competent than you performs the surgery.
not by much.
listen, mom told me about the reason for your Himalaya trip, about dad's ashes.
that was pretty...
stupid of you, Eli.
you shouldn't be doing things like that, given your medical situation.
do you think there could be some, uh, greater significance to me and dad having the same condition?
uh, absolutely.
Yeah, it's called genetics, dumb-ass.
you also have mom's eczema and uncle Gary's terminal lameness.
please stay off of mountaintops.
Yeah, stone. Eli stone.
no, Dr. Chen said -- no, no, I don't have an appointment.
I - I'm trying to make one.
I - I - I'll call you back.
what the hell happened to you?
it's a long story.
um, check to see if anyone saw a biplane flying around downtown today, and, uh, get me a list of all the boys' choirs in Northern California.
and which matter should I bill this time to?
special projects.
special projects.
Oh, like planning your engagement party?
just like that, yes.
well, at least I understand what I'm doing with the party, but choirs and biplanes
why am I doing this?
not quite sure yet.
excuse me, Mr. Stone.
I'm only five years older than you.
stop calling me "Mr. Stone."
I lean on formality when someone doesn't know who I am.
I know who you are.
you're a first year associate.
you said your name in the staff meeting yesterday.
it's Mary.
it's Maggie, actually.
I was kidding.
recognize your name from all the e-mails you sent me about the Gro Plus case.
Yeah. People like you are the reason they invented spam blockers.
well, did you read them?
I skimmed the first one. I deleted the 49 others.
well, here. Try a hard copy.
Oh, does the case get better when it's on paper?
the case is open and shut.
the pesticide Gro Plus uses on its farms made our clients sterile.
first of all, we don't have any clients, so there is no "our."
and secondly, the only illegal alien that a jury sympathizes th is E. T.
and maybe Alf.
being farmhands doesn't automatically make them illegal aliens.
Oscar and Blanca Ramirez came to this country and bought into the American dream wholeheartedly.
which explains the lawsuit.
but it's a legit claim.
there's evidence linking chlorophosphate with female reproductive problems.
look, these people are the tip of a very large iceberg.
half the workers on Gro Plus' farms right now are experiencing health problems, impaired vision, systemic bronchial infections
none of which is relevant to a claim of sterility.
look, you want my advice?
tell our non-clients to quit their jobs and adopt.
you're a gifted trial lawyer, Eli.
your work on the Beutel trial only confirmed that which I've long suspected.
that I have a professional death wish?
that you're a phenomenal talent.
but, yes, your recent behavior has been the cause of some concern.
it's recent, sir, but temporary.
that's what I wanted to hear.
Solinksy is one of the most significant trials this firm has had the good fortune to handle in several years.
well, you're giving it to the right associate, sir.
good.
so... your thought.
uh, firstly, uh, I noticed that you're preparing a motion to strike the time-barred claims.
Yes, Martin Posner's been drafting the brief himself.
I think it's a loser no matter who drafts it.
you're suggesting a motion in limine.
it'll not only be more effective, it'll get filed closer to the start of the trial, so it'll catch the other side off guard.
sir, you should get down.
get what? - Get down!
sir, I can explain.
I'd like that very much.
no, uh, th-there was a -- it's a glare on the building, and it--it--it looked like there w, uh, something flying towards the...
Oh, my god. He's a pilot.
who's a pilot?
um, do you mind if we continue the Solinsky discussion in, say, a week?
a week?
Yeah, there's another case that I have to lose first.
are those for trial, or are you planning a wedding?
Oh, they're my trial binders -- pleadings, precedent, deposition transcripts, and scientific studies color-coded and cross-indexed.
you only got permission from the firm to take the case yesterday.
how did you get all that done since then?
I figured I'd get permission eventually, so I've been working weekends.
you're supposed to work for the firm on the weekends, preferably on cases that aren't dead-bang losers.
for a guy who's coming off a huge win, you don't sound like you have much confidence.
don't mistake a firm grip on reality for lack of confidence.
there are causation problems, proof problems, contributory negligence problems...
you think Gro Plus is gonna say the Ramirezes are to blame for Blanca's sterility?
no, I know that for sure.
so you didn't wear the safety mask provided by Gro Plus.
I didn't have to.
I flew the plane which sprayed the pesticide.
and I'm not the one who was hurt. My wife
object to the answer as non-responsive.
object to the term "hurt."
object to the speculation.
move to strike and ask to instruct the witness.
object to all the objections, your honor.
just get on with it, boys.
what about the safety lectures Gro Plus held?
how many of those did you and your wife attend? - None.
had you attended, is it possible you might have picked up a tip or two about the safety mask?
pass the witness.
what is this, Mr. Ramirez?
it's a bandana.
and what does Gro Plus call it?
a safety mask.
so what does that make the safety lectures, a company-wide knitting circle?
do I even have to object?
move it along, counsel.
Gro Plus only has these lectures to protect themselves.
objection. Speculation.
sustained.
Mr. Ramirez, I think the point is if you and your wife knew that the pesticide you were working with was dangerous, why weren't you more careful?
of course we tried to protect ourselves against the pesticide, but what we should have been protecting ourselves against was Gro Plus.
pass the witness.
all these other supposedly barren, allegedly heartbroken people
why didn't they join in your lawsuit?
because they don't live there legally.
they didn't go to a notario and sign the papers.
they're afraid of deportation.
so all this is just you being charitable, Mr. Ramirez, standing up for the disenfranchised.
that's what people do in America.
they stand up for what is right.
I'm concerned about Eli.
I'm hearing some rumors of erratic behavior on his part.
is he all right?
he's fine.
he tried to tickle me yesterday.
I'm worried about him, sweetheart.
do you know why?
something about a glare.
so...
is everything okay with Eli?
everything's perfectly fine, dad.
yes?
this is regarding the Berkman Antitrust case.
can we take a rain check on lunch?
always.
Bye, dad.
Bye, sweetie.
Hey, Patti.
Eli's not back from court yet, is he?
not yet, no.
he's probably out looking for choirs or biplanes or Huey Lewis.
what?
don't worry about it. Par for the course around here.
what happened? Chip a nail?
your roots starting to grow out again?
look, Patti, I don't know why I've always rubbed you the wrong way, but I know that I do.
it's just, given everything that's happened to Eli, I think we should be uniting.
I'll be the first to admit, Eli's acting like he's been freebasing copier toner, but maybe you're overreacting.
well, if I can't overreact to a brain aneurysm, what can I overreact to, right?
well, that's a good point.
Thanks, Patti.
sure.
no problem.
this is good, right?
first day of trial, he already wants to settle.
we don't know that's what he wants. So...
poker face, okay?
what are you offering?
I mean...
whatever it is, it better be good.
Oh, it's very good.
you dismiss the case...
with prejudice.
And?
no "and."
isn't there usually an "and"?
what my associate means is customarily, the defense will offer a financial incentive for dismissal.
well, in this case, the incentive would be un-financial.
like a lifetime supply of Gro Plus canned goods?
like the possibility of avoiding deportation.
even under the current administration, I doubt homeland security can deport American citizens.
see, now that's the ironic thing.
this morning, Mr. Ramirez testified that he and his wife had both been naturalized by someone called a notario.
now most of these notarios are notorious for not having actually naturalized anybody.
they collect their fee, they have the unwitting clients sign some bogus papers, and at the end of the day, said clients are still about as American as Kim Jong Il.
bottom line, your clients were duped.
even so, it--it will take months before immigration moves on this.
well, interestingly enough, homeland security seems to find a reason to speed these things along when the immigrant in question's a pilot with access to a plane.
your blackmail -- excuse me, offer -- is rejected.
we'll see you in court.
we passed the test.
we answered all the questions.
we were so proud.
we saluted the flag. The notario even had us swear on a bible.
Yeah, he should've been the one to do that, actually.
I would think they would be arresting this man, not deporting us.
Oh, I think they'r gonna be doing both.
but I'm gonna fight the deportation, okay?
problem is, I have to do it right now.
but then who's gonna represent us in the trial?
wait, Eli. I'm no ready for this.
well, I can't be in two courtrooms at the same time.
at least this case you know.
just go in there, make a stupid motion and run out the clock.
stupid motion?
Yes, you should be good at that.
now just wait a minute. I - I almost got it. Now...
they make it so darn difficult for these things to operate.
mm, j--can I?
let the record show that the counselor is good at electronics.
your honor, Oscar and Blanca Ramirez
Oh, w-wait, wait. We haven't heard from immigration and customs yet.
your honor, the respondents are not the wrongdoers here.
they acted in what they thought was compliance with the law.
this morning, I presided over a case in which the defendant thought he was batman.
didn't make it so.
your honor, you can't deport two law-abiding citizens because of someone else's fraud.
a, they're not citizens.
B, they're not law-abiding, or they wouldn't be in the country illegally.
so unless you can show cause why the defendants shouldn't be deported
I can show cause, your honor. - Great!
now would be the time.
I just -- I can't do it this particular minute.
my cause i - isn't here.
I - I need a continuance.
we just started.
48 hours, judge, then I'll be right back here with my cause.
48 hours.
Mrs. Ramirez, tell us how you first learned that you were infertile.
objection.
in the form of a question, counselor.
right, like "jeopardy"!
you and your husband visited a fertility doctor.
d - did you not?
the doctor -- he did some tests, and--and h-he said that it was my fault.
and you blamed the pesticide used on Gro Plus' farm.
is - isn't that right? - Yes.
other women I work with -- they can't have children, and we all work in the fields.
and when we go home, we can smell the chemicals.
they're on our clothes, and we can taste it in our mouths.
where did you meet your husband, Mrs. Ramez?
uh, Gro Plus, on the farm.
so it stands to reason that there was never a time when you and husband were trying to get pregnant before you went to work for Gro Plus.
sorry
I thought I had all of it.
well, Mrs. Ramirez...
isn't it possible you were infertile before you were exposed to the pesticide on the Gro Plus farm?
no, I'm sure that it's not.
then you've tried to get pregnant before?
no, I haven't tried.
so how do you know?
objection, your honor!
to... his tone.
I don't like his tone.
overruled, Ms. Dekker. Continue.
Mrs. Ramirez...
I doubt you'd been to a fertility clinic before you met your husband.
this is your first marriage.
how can you be sure that you weren't infertile before?
I know that I could have babies before.
he doesn't know, does he?
who doesn't know what? I-I mean...objection!
who doesn't know what?
I...
I had a baby before I met Oscar, and...
I gave him up for adoption.
Oscar, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry I never told you before.
if you could deceive your own husband, Mrs. Ramirez, then how is this jury to know you're not deceiving them?
What'd I miss?
can I talk yet? - No.
now? - Not yet.
when I left you alone this morning to deal with the fallout from Maggie screw up number one,
I told you to stall, and if the judge told you to stop stalling, I told you to start objecting.
I - I did!
I'm sorry.
Oh, you're sorry?
before the Ramirezes met you, they were two happily married American citizens.
now they're neither.
okay, deportation aside, this is good for us, isn't it?
I mean, it's evidence that Blanc had no problem conceiving before working for Gro Plus.
it would've been good for us if we knew ahead of time that our allegedly infertile client was a mommy!
now all the jury sees is a liar.
and juries -- they don't like to give money to liars!
she -- she didn't even tell her husband!
how was I expected to know?
you're expected to find out.
now I'm gonna lose two cases.
I just promised the immigration judge proof our clients are legal, which is gonna be a little hard to produce since they're not.
wait, you're yelling at me about malpractice after you lied to a judge?
Wh--I wouldn't have lied to him if you hadn't have got me in this mess in the first place.
there's two kinds of lawyers, Maggie.
there's good lawyers and there's bad lawyers, and a bad lawyer with good intentions is still a bad lawyer.
I may be a bad lawyer, but I'll get better.
you'll always be a jerk.
there's 53 boys choirs in Northern California?
it's gonna take forever.
do me a favor.
find out which ones wear red and white robes.
sure thing, boss.
wait a second.
I know that tone.
what did I do?
you didn't do anything.
you didn't say anything, either.
Patti, I'm having a very bad day here, and that's under the new definition of "bad" that I've been working with lately.
eight years we've been together, Eli.
my daughters call you "uncle."
when my husband left me, when my father passed away, you were the first call I made.
you have a brain aneurysm, and I have to find out about it from Malibu Barbie?
she told you?
she thought I knew.
and for the life of me, I can't figure out why I didn't.
I thought you trusted me.
I do.
I do trust you.
I just -- the more people I tell, the more real it becomes, so I'm...
Eli, I'm not people.
are you going to die?
eventually.
just not anytime soon, I hope.
well, you keep anything else from me, and that's gonna change.
I didn't mean to tell her.
I thought she already knew.
no one else can find out, okay? No one.
if you mean my father, don't worry.
I didn't say anything.
I would never do that to you.
good,'cause I can't lose my job on top of everything else.
they can't fire you for having an aneurysm.
you think I could keep my malpractice insurance with this?
cause no insurance means no license, and no license means no job.
and except for the last 48 hours, I like my job.
what's happened in the last 48 hours?
what difference does it make?
you won't talk about your condition.
you won't talk about work, you're acting erratically, and every time I try to reach out to you to see what's wrong, to see if I can help, you -- you push me away.
I just want things to be normal again.
have they been normal?
or have you...
I don't know -- tried to tackle anyone lately?
that was a misunderstanding, that's all.
Really?
you haven't had any more episodes? Any?
look...
I admit that when we found out about the aneurysm,
I reacted horribly.
but I wanna be there for you now.
I'm ready to be.
why won't you let me?
I know you need to talk about this, but right now I really need to not talk about it.
and since I'm the guy with the aneurysm
you might have the aneurysm, Eli, but you're not the only one who has to live with it.
has the jury reached a verdict?
we have, your honor.
in the matter of Ramirez vs. Gro Plus foods incorporated, we find in favor of the defendant, Gro Plus foods.
how you doing, Oscar?
my wife had another man's baby.
I've had better days.
she got pregnant before she even met you, right after she came to America, I thought.
she left the baby in a church.
she didn't even name him.
are you judging her for that?
no, she -- she was young and scared.
but she wasn't young and she wasn't scared when she decided not to tell me she'd been a mother.
I'll give you the young part, but I - I think she was very scared.
I recently found out some things about myself, and, um...
I had a hard time talking to people about it, particularly the people I'm closest to.
sometimes the -- the closer you are to someone, the harder it is to tell them your secrets.
that doesn't make it right.
no, it doesn't.
it just -- it just makes it human.
you should get some sleep tonight, Mr. Stone.
tomorrow's the big one, huh?
I like this country.
I'd hate to have to leave.
no pressure there, Oscar.
Mr. Stone...
given your proximity, I'm assuming there's something you wanted to say to me.
th -- I love the tie, sir.
I was just wondering the make.
Armani.
is that it, or have you given more thought to our conversation the other day?
I did give it some thought, sir, and I think it needs another day of thought.
I followed the signs, and all it's gotten me is two clients who are gonna get deported and a case I lost.
well, you lost one of them, not the big one.
everybody needs to stop calling tomorrow "the big one."
I'm just saying, maybe you took the pesticide case so you'd be their attorney for the immigration one.
but if this choir is supposed to give me a clue as to how to help them, then god needs to be a little less oblique.
you're not gonna win every case, Eli.
you probably won't win most of them.
I sense another use of the "p" word coming.
most prophets work for social justice but didn't achieve it in their lifetimes.
Oh, that's great.
so when I die, they're gonna win on appeal?
I'm getting the ass end of this arrangement, man.
it could be worse.
you could've spent ten hours hidden in the back of a flatbed truck to come over here and get a job for $3 an hour picking strawberries in the 90-degree sun 12 hours a day.
turns out the pesticide the farm used made you infertile, but that's the least of your worries 'cause that citizenship test you took was a fraud, so they're gonna deport you back to the country you risked everything to leave in the first place.
you know, you may just have written my closing for me.
as soon as I can get this damn thing working, the record will reflect...
the record -- ah.
uh, the, uh, the record will reflect that, um, the respondents are present.
I hope your evidence of citizenship is present as well, counselor.
they're one and the same, your honor.
and if you'll permit me to call Oscar Ramirez to the stand,
I can produce that reason.
you told me you could show cause why the respondent shouldn't be deported.
and I can, your honor.
Mr. Ramirez, how many amendments to the constitution are there?
objection.
you see how easy that was?
your honor, these questions are taken directly from the U. S. C. I. S.'S naturalization exam.
but I'm not administering this test just now, Mr. Stone.
but could you take it?
what are the voting rights amendments?
15, 19, 24 and 26.
the 26th amendment says that no state or government can deny a person of 18 years of age or older the right to vote.
some states could allow younger people to vote
you better start telling me how this is relevant, or you're in contempt.
these questions are our country's only standard of naturalization.
after a candidate has been fingerprinted and photographed, after they've completed a naturalization application and interview, and after they've been sworn under oath.
Yeah, that definitely would've been easier.
instead, they doused themselves with water so they wouldn't dehydrate when they were crammed into a hidden compartment of a pickup truck, and they didn't do it so they could come and pick strawberries.
they did it because they believed in America.
in Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, we're seeing firsthand the seeds of democracy.
they don't grow on every patch of earth.
the freedom we have here is unique.
it's special.
and Oscar and Blanca Ramirez
they were willing to risk their lives for it.
now I'm not saying that citizenship should be a prize for making it over the border, and I'm not saying that illegal immigration isn't a major issue facing this country, but Oscar and Blanca Ramirez are not a policy.
they're people.
and if this truly is the home of the brave, then they're just as American as anyone in this home.
two years? What does that mean?
it means you have two years to complete the naturalization process.
no deportation?
no deportation.
welcome to America.
Oh, thank you. - Thank you.
thank you. - You're welcome.
so do you guys have you plans?
I'm gonna find my son.
no.
we're going to find our son, and we'll start with the church where Blanca left him.
we're hoping they can tell us if he's been adopted.
thank you, Mr. Stone.
thank you, Maggie. - You're welcome.
church. That's it.
Blanca! Wait!
um, this is a list of churches, uh, in Roseville, a town outside Sacramento.
there's one called St. Anthony's.
there's a boys' choir there.
there's about 30 kids.
their vestments are red and white.
you might want to start there.
wh - why do you say that?
it's a very long story, but just trust me on this one, okay?
gracias.
did you lose your other case yet?
lost part, won part, actually.
but it did make me realize that, um, I can't take on Solinsky right now.
so we're back to tilting at windmills again, is that it?
I just think the, uh...
the way I - I play the game -- the gal game
has got to change.
change.
how?
well, for one thing, I can't spend all my time trying cases like Solinsky.
supreme court - bound cases of national notoriety.
I can't spend 70 hours a week making rich people richer.
I just -- I - I need to stay free and--and open and, uh...
like a -- like a tree in the wind and all that eastern stuff, you know?
like a tree in the wind.
I'm sure you think me a cold businessman, Eli
a senior partner who's only interested in the billable hours of one of his senior associates, but my investment in you hasn't just been financial.
and I'm not talking about my daughter.
I hired you.
I mentored you before you even met Taylor.
I didn't assign you Solinsky because you got the better of Matt Dowd in a staff meeting.
I assigned you that case because I've always thought you were the future of this firm
my firm that I've spent over 30 years building, and I thought that's what you wanted, too.
I did, but...
okay, then. I respect that.
personally, I'm gonna be curious to see how you adjust to your new lifestyle.
I'm not sure I follow, sir.
well, Don Quixote gave up nearly all his land so he could afford his books on chivalry.
I'm wondering, Eli, what will you give up?
good night.
good night, Patti. - Night.
we're okay, right?
I'm okay.
you have a hole in your head.
Yeah, let's keep that between ourselves, okay?
it's not Christmas.
do I have you to thank for this?
this is Kali, the Hindu goddess of annihilation.
the Hindus don't have a goddess of malpractice.
but don't worry.
next time we get you into court, you'll do better.
there's gonna be a next time?
only if you don't mind working with a jerk.
I had to leave my coffee can in India.
the can had sentimental value, but, uh,
I couldn't get it through customs.
why are you telling me this?
I'm trying to tell you things...
start telling you things.
the other night, I saw a choir by the couch.
Mm-hmm, boys choir, but I don't think that's relevant.
I tackled your dad because I was getting chased by a biplane.
this is...
it's a lot like your dad.
couldn't have been easy to tell me that.
what? What are you looking at?
just a certain yak hooves candle.
apparently, it's supposed to be an aphrodisiac.
what is it?
um, there's gunfire.
but no singing?
um, nope.
so this is progress.
its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
the bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
coming!
hang on a second.
Hello?
can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.
looking sharp.
use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.
sorry. I'm excited.
here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.
a perfect report card, all B's.
very proud.
ma! I got a thing going here.
you got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!
wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.
is that fuzz gel? - A little. SpeciaI day, graduation.
never thought I'd make it.
three days grade school, three days high school.
those were awkward.
three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
you did come back different.
Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
hear about Frankie? - Yeah.
you going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.
everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
that's why we don't need vacations.
boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.
well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!
Bee-men. - Amen!
Hallelujah!
students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...
...9: 15.
that concludes our ceremonies.
and begins your career at Honex Industries!
will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
heads up! Here we go.
keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.
welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
this is it!
we know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as...
honey!
that girI was hot. - She's my cousin!
she is? - Yes, we're all cousins.
right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
these bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
what do you think he makes? - Not enough.
here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
what does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.
can anyone work on the Krelman?
of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
but choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
the same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
what's the difference?
you'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
so you'll just work us to death?
we'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"what's the difference?" How can you say that?
one job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
but, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
why would you question anything? We're bees.
we're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
you ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
please clear the gate. RoyaI Nectar Force on approach.
wait a second. Oheck it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
they know what it's like outside the hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!
you guys did great!
you're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were. - I don't know.
their day's not planned.
outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
you can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
right.
look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
it's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.
perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?
distant. Distant.
look at these two.
couple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.
it must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
he had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.
what were you doing during this?
trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
a little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
we're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
six miles, huh? - Barry!
a puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
maybe I am. - You are not!
we're going 0900 at J-Gate.
what do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
dad, you surprised me.
you decide what you're interested in?
well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.
do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
son, let me tell you about stirring.
you grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
you get yourseIf into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.
you know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
you were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
that's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.
you're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
you're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!
wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
let's open some honey and celebrate!
maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.
shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
we're starting work today! - Today's the day.
come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!
one of them's yours! Congratulations! Step to the side.
What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!
couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
make your choice.
you want to go first? - No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
wax monkey's always open.
the Krelman opened up again.
what happened?
a bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
all right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
what happened to you? Where are you?
I'm going out. - Out? Out where?
out there. - Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
you're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
another call coming in.
if anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean delivery on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
it's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
sign here, here. Just initial that.
thank you. - OK.
you got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
so be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
aIso, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
that's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
all right, launch positions!
buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
black and yellow!
Hello!
you ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
wind, check.
antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.
wings, check. - Stinger, check.
scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies, let's move it out!
pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
all of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
so blue.
I feel so fast and free!
box kite!
flowers!
this is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.
bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick.
that is one nectar collector!
ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic.
that's amazing. Why do we do that?
that's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Could be daisies. Don't we need those?
copy that visual.
wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
affirmative.
this is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
it smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
my sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
problem!
guys! - This could be bad.
affirmative.
very close.
gonna hurt.
mama's little boy.
you are way out of position, rookie!
Ooming in at you like a missile!
help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
should we tell him? - I think he knows.
what is this?!
match point!
you can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
gross.
there's a bee in the car!
do something! - I'm driving!
Hi, bee. - He's back here!
he's going to sting me!
nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
he blinked!
spray him, Granny!
what are you doing?!
wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
can't fly in rain.
can't fly in rain.
can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
check out my new résumé. I made it into a fold-out brochure.
you see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
what was that?
maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...
drapes!
that is diabolical.
it's fantastic. It's got all my speciaI skilIs, even my top-ten favorite movies.
what's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that...
...kind of stuff.
no wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
when I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
there's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming.
I could feeI it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
wait! Stop! Bee!
stand back. These are winter boots.
wait!
don't kill him!
you know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
why does his life have less value than yours?
why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
my brochure!
there you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing.
put that on your résumé brochure.
my whole face could puff up.
make it one of your special skilIs.
knocking someone out is aIso a speciaI skill.
right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
you could put carob chips on there. - Bye.
supposed to be less calories. - Bye.
I gotta say something.
she saved my life. I gotta say something.
all right, here it goes.
what would I say?
I could really get in trouble.
it's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
no. Yes. No.
do it. I can't.
how should I start it? "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
you're talking. - Yes, I know.
you're talking!
I'm so sorry.
no, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming.
but I don't recall going to bed.
well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
this is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
and if it wasn't for you...
I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
that was a little weird.
I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now.
wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?
the talking thing.
same way you did, I guess. "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
that's very funny. - Yeah.
bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
anyway...
can I...
...get you something? - Like what?
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
I don't want to put you out.
it's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
it's just coffee. - I hate to impose.
don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.
Hey, you want rum cake?
I shouldn't. - Have some.
no, I can't. - Come on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
where? - These stripes don't help.
you look great!
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
are you all right?
no.
he's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
he finally gets there.
he runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.
and he says, "Watermelon?" I thought you said Guatemalan.
"why would I marry a watermelon?"
is that a bee joke?
that's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
so, what are you gonna do, Barry?
about work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
you do? - Sure.
my parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
Really? - My only interest is flowers.
our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
anyway, if you look...
there's my hive right there. See it?
you're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
no way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
why do girIs put rings on their toes? - Why not?
it's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that.
you all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.
just having two cups of coffee!
anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
are you...?
can I take a piece of this with me?
sure! Here, have a crumb.
Thanks! - Yeah.
all right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around.
or not.
OK, Barry.
and thank you so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
this can't possibly work.
he's all set to go. We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
sounds amazing. - It was amazing!
it was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
giant, scary humans! What were they like?
huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
they eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.
do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't.
how'd you get back? - Poodle.
you did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
you had your "experience." Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
well... - Well?
well, I met someone.
you did? Was she Bee-ish?
a wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.
spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.
I can't get by that face.
so who is she?
she's... human.
no, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy.
she's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
we're not dating.
you're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
she saved my life! And she understands me.
this is over!
eat this.
this is not over! What was that?
they call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey!
and that's not what they eat. That's what falIs off what they eat!
you know what a Cinnabon is? - No.
it's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
sit down!
...really hot! - Listen to me!
we are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
there's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
you have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
thinking bee. - Thinking bee.
thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
there he is. He's in the pool.
you know what your problem is, Barry?
I gotta start thinking bee?
how much longer will this go on?
it's been three days! Why aren't you working?
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
what life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee!
would it kill you to make a little honey?
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
Martin, would you talk to him?
Barry, I'm talking to you!
you coming?
got everything?
all set!
go ahead. I'll catch up.
don't be too long.
watch this!
we're still here. - I told you not to yell at him.
he doesn't respond to yelling!
then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen!
I'm not listening to this.
sorry, I've gotta go.
where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend.
a girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Bye.
I just hope she's Bee-ish.
they have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
to be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
a tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
no. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere?
it's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
you don't have that?
we have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
Oh, my.
dumb bees!
you must want to sting all those jerks.
we try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
so you have to watch your temper.
very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:
anger, jealousy, lust.
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
Yeah.
what is wrong with you?! - It's a bug.
he's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!
what was that? A Pic 'N' save circular?
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
it felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
you've really got that down to a science.
I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet.
what in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
how did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,
ray Liotta Private Select?
is he that actor? - I never heard of him.
why is this here? - For people. We eat it.
you don't have enough food of your own?
well, yes. - How do you get it?
bees make it. - I know who makes it!
and it's hard to make it!
there's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
it's organic. - It's our-ganic!
it's just honey, Barry.
just what?!
bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
you've taken our homes, schooIs, hospitaIs! This is all we have!
and it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
Hey, Hector.
you almost done? - Almost.
he is here. I sense it.
well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
you're busted, box boy!
I knew I heard something. So you can talk!
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
I don't understand. I thought we were friends.
the last thing we want to do is upset bees!
you're too late! It's ours now!
you, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
you, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, lgnacio!
where is the honey coming from?
tell me where!
honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
crazy person!
what horrible thing has happened here?
these faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere!
just keep still.
what? You're not dead?
do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
to Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
I'm going to Tacoma.
and you? - He really is dead.
all right.
what is that?! - Oh, no!
a wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?
jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!
how much do you people need to see?!
open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!
from NPR News in Washington, I'm OarI Kasell.
but don't kill no more bugs!
bee! - Moose blood guy!!
you hear something? - Like what?
like tiny screaming.
turn off the radio.
what's up, bee boy?
Hey, Blood.
just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.
I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it.
I mean, that honey's ours.
bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in.
it's a close community.
not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.
what if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.
nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!
at least you're out in the world. You must meet girIs.
mosquito girIs try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.
mosquito girI don't want no mosquito.
you got to be kidding me!
Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!
Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch you all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?
we throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.
what is this place?
a bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.
they are pinheads!
pinhead.
Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
the Thomas 3000!
smoker?
ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
a couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
they make the honey, and we make the money.
"they make the honey, and we make the money?"
Oh, my!
what's going on? Are you OK?
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walIs?
our queen was moved here. We had no choice.
this is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes!
that's a drag queen!
what is this?
Oh, no!
there's hundreds of them!
bee honey.
our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!
this is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.
Oh, Barry, stop.
who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.
do these look like rumors?
that's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.
how did you get mixed up in this?
he's been talking to humans.
what? - Talking to humans?!
he has a human girlfriend. And they make out!
make out? Barry!
we do not.
you wish you could. - Whose side are you on?
the bees!
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?
I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!
dad, I remember you coming home so overworked your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.
I remember that.
what right do they have to our honey?
we live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
even if it's true, what can one bee do?
sting them where it really hurts.
in the face! The eye!
that would hurt. - No.
up the nose? That's a killer.
there's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.
hive at Five, the hive's only full-hour action news source.
with Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
weather with Storm Stinger.
sports with Buzz Larvi.
and Jeanette Ohung.
good evening. I'm Bob Bumble. - And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
a tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!
tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,
Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.
tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
did you ever think, "I'm a kid from the hive. I can't do this"?
bees have never been afraid to change the world.
what about Bee Columbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
we were thinking of stickball or candy stores.
how old are you?
the bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.
you know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.
it's a common name. Next week...
he looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...
next week...
glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.
bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.
always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.
in tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!
it was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81 .
honey, her backhand's a joke! I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
quiet, please. ActuaI work going on here.
is that that same bee? - Yes, it is!
I'm helping him sue the human race.
hello. - Hello, bee.
this is Ken.
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a haIf. Vibram sole, I believe.
why does he talk again?
listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.
but it's our yogurt night!
Bye-bye.
why is yogurt night so difficult?!
you poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!
Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.
Frosting... - How many sugars?
just one. I try not to use the competition.
so why are you helping me?
bees have good qualities.
and it takes my mind off the shop.
instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.
those are great, if you're three.
and artificiaI flowers.
Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.
bent stingers, pointless pollination.
bees must hate those fake things!
nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.
maybe this could make up for it a little bit.
this lawsuit's a pretty big deal. - I guess.
you sure you want to go through with it?
am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, "Honey, I'm home," without paying a royalty!
it's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.
what have we gotten into here, Barry?
it's pretty big, isn't it?
I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.
you think billion-dollar multinationaI food companies have good lawyers?
everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.
what's the matter? - I don't know, I just got a chill.
well, if it isn't the bee team.
you boys work on this?
all rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
all right. Oase number 4475,
superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?
a privilege.
Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.
Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman.
born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.
if we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.
I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!
talking bee!
how do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?
they could be using laser beams!
robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!
Mr. Benson?
ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here.
I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me.
it's important to all bees. We invented it!
we make it. And we protect it with our lives.
unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys! I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!
I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!
call your first witness.
so, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.
I suppose so.
I see you aIso own Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.
beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.
I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?
no. - I couldn't hear you.
no. - No.
because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
they're very lovable creatures.
yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
you mean like this?
bears kill bees!
how'd you like his head crashing through your living room?!
biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!
OK, that's enough. Take him away.
so, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.
where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.
but you've never been a police officer, have you?
no, I haven't.
no, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee cuIture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.
Oh, please.
have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.
or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
that's not his reaI name?! You idiots!
Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.
thank you. Thank you.
I see from your résumé that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you?
exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?
watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!
this isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella!
why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!
order in this court! - You're all thinking it!
order! Order, I say!
say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.
I think the jury's on our side.
are we doing everything right, legally?
I'm a florist.
right. Well, here's to a great team.
to a great team!
well, hello.
Ken! - Hello.
I didn't think you were coming.
no, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.
I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
Oh, that was lucky.
there's a little left. I could heat it up.
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
so I hear you're quite a tennis player.
I'm not much for the game myseIf. The ball's a little grabby.
that's where I usually sit. Right... there.
Ken, Barry was looking at your résumé, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a speciaI skill.
you think I don't see what you're doing?
I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.
do we?
bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
that's just what I was thinking about doing.
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
I'm going to drain the old stinger.
Yeah, you do that.
look at that.
you know, I've just about had it with your little mind games.
what's that? - Italian Vogue.
mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
a lot of ads.
remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?
funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
I think something stinks in here!
I love the smell of flowers.
how do you like the smell of flames?!
not as much.
water bug! Not taking sides!
Ken, I'm wearing a Chopstick hat! This is pathetic!
I've got issues!
well, well, well, a royal flush!
you're bluffing. - Am l?
surf's up, dude!
poo water!
that bowI is gnarly.
except for those dirty yellow rings!
Kenneth! What are you doing?!
you know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!
we need to talk!
he's just a little bee!
and he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?
no, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!
fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
my nerves are fried from riding on this emotionaI roller coaster!
goodbye, Ken.
and for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificiaI sweeteners made by man!
I'm sorry about all that.
I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!
I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.
I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.
are you OK for the trial?
I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.
we would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...
Yeah.
layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.
don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.
you got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?
only to losing, son. Only to losing.
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.
what exactly is your relationship to that woman?
we're friends.
good friends? - Yes.
how good? Do you live together?
wait a minute...
are you her little...
...bedbug?
I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?
Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents!
Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are!
hold me back!
you're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?
he's denouncing bees!
don't you all date your cousins?
Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy!
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
Oh, I'm hit!!
Oh, lordy, I am hit!
order! Order!
the venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!
I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!
you see? You can't treat them like equaIs! They're striped savages!
Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!
Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs.
what angeI of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?
I will have order in this court. Order!
order, please!
the case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
Hey, buddy. - Hey.
is there much pain? - Yeah.
I...
I blew the whole case, didn't I?
it doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died.
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
they got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
look, there's a little celery still on it.
what was it like to sting someone?
I can't explain it. It was all...
all adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!
all right.
you think it was all a trap?
of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.
what were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world.
what will the humans do to us if they win?
I don't know.
I hear they put the roaches in moteIs. That doesn't sound so bad.
Adam, they check in, but they don't check out!
Oh, my.
could you get a nurse to close that window?
Why? - The smoke.
bees don't smoke.
right. Bees don't smoke.
bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking.
that's it! That's our case!
it is? It's not over?
get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.
and assuming you've done step 29 correctly, you're ready for the tub.
Mr. Flayman.
yes? Yes, Your Honor!
where is the rest of your team?
well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a resuIt, we don't make very good time.
I actually heard a funny story about...
your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time?
how much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?
they have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.
I move for a complete dismissaI of this entire case!
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion.
but you can't! We have a terrific case.
where is your proof? Where is the evidence?
show me the smoking gun!
hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?
here is your smoking gun.
what is that?
it's a bee smoker!
what, this? This harmless little contraption?
this couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.
look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or non?"
is this what nature intended for us?
to be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps?
living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?
what are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card.
ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!
free the bees! Free the bees!
free the bees!
free the bees! Free the bees!
the court finds in favor of the bees!
Vanessa, we won!
I knew you could do it! High-five!
sorry.
I'm OK! You know what this means?
all the honey will finally belong to the bees.
now we won't have to work so hard all the time.
this is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.
you'll regret this.
Barry, how much honey is out there?
all right. One at a time.
Barry, who are you wearing?
my sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.
what if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean?
we've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.
Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?
first, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.
then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.
we demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a fiIthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.
we're all aware of what they do in the woods.
wait for my signal.
take him out.
he'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
and we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...
but it's just a prance-about stage name!
...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus heaIth products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.
can't breathe.
bring it in, boys!
hold it right there! Good.
tap it.
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming!
I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down.
shut down honey production!
stop making honey!
turn your key, sir!
what do we do now?
cannonball!
we're shutting honey production!
mission abort.
aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.
Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there.
Oh, yeah?
what's going on? Where is everybody?
are they out celebrating? - They're home.
they don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.
I heard your Uncle OarI was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.
at least we got our honey back.
sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
it's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.
this was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.
and now...
now I can't.
I don't understand why they're not happy.
I thought their lives would be better!
they're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people.
you don't have any idea what's going on, do you?
what did you want to show me? - This.
what happened here?
that is not the half of it.
Oh, no. Oh, my.
they're all wilting.
doesn't look very good, does it?
no.
and whose fault do you think that is?
you know, I'm gonna guess bees.
bees?
specifically, me.
I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.
it's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
that's our whole SAT test right there.
take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.
and then, of course...
the human species?
so if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it?
I know this is aIso partly my fault.
how about a suicide pact?
how do we do it?
I'll sting you, you step on me. - That just kills you twice.
right, right.
listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.
I had to open my mouth and talk.
Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?
to the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.
they've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.
it's the last chance I'll ever have to see it.
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.
I know. Me neither.
tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports.
wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
roses!
roses?!
roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.
flowers, bees, pollen!
I know. That's why this is the last parade.
maybe not. Could you ask him to slow down?
could you slow down?
OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a totaI disaster, all my fault.
Yes, it kind of is.
I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse.
actually, it's completely closed down.
I thought maybe you were remodeling.
but I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined.
I don't want to hear it!
all right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.
I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.
all we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got.
bees. - Park.
pollen! - Flowers.
Repollination! - Across the nation!
tournament of Roses, Pasadena, California.
they've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
security will be tight.
I have an idea.
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
official floral business. It's real.
sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
thank you. It was a gift.
once inside, we just pick the right float.
how about The Princess and the Pea?
I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!
Yes, I got it.
where should I sit? - What are you?
I believe I'm the pea. - The pea?
it goes under the mattresses.
not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal.
you do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!
let's see what this baby'll do.
Hey, what are you doing?!
then all we do is blend in with traffic...
...without arousing suspicion.
once at the airport, there's no stopping us.
stop! Security.
you and your insect pack your float? - Yes.
has it been in your possession the entire time?
would you remove your shoes?
remove your stinger. - It's part of me.
I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.
then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job.
can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!
I think this is gonna work.
it's got to work.
attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.
we have a bit of bad weather in New York.
it looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay.
Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it.
I gotta get up there and talk to them.
be careful.
can I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?
I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
captain, I'm in a real situation.
What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing.
bee!
don't freak out! My entire species...
what are you doing?
wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney?
don't move.
Oh, Barry.
good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.
would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?
and please hurry!
what happened here?
there was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.
one's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!
is that another bee joke? - No!
no one's flying the plane!
this is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status?
this is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
he's unconscious, and so is the copilot.
not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?
as a matter of fact, there is.
who's that? - Barry Benson.
from the honey trial?! Oh, great.
Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metaI bee.
it's got giant wings, huge engines.
I can't fly a plane.
why not? Isn't John TravoIta a pilot? - Yes.
how hard could it be?
wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning.
this is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing.
Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...
that's Barry!
...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.
Flowers?!
we have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.
just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.
they've done enough damage.
but isn't he your only hope?
technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.
their wings are too small...
haven't we heard this a million times?
the surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.
get this on the air! - Got it.
stand by. - We're going live.
the way we work may be a mystery to you.
making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.
but let me tell you about a small job.
if you do it well, it makes a big difference.
more than we realized. To us, to everyone.
that's why I want to get bees back to working together.
that's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.
we get behind a fellow.
black and yellow! - Hello!
left, right, down, hover.
HOVER? - Forget hover.
this isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
Barry, what happened?!
wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.
that may have been helping me. - And now we're not!
so it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
all of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!
move out!
our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!
don't have to yell.
I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.
it's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!
it's not a tone. I'm panicking!
I can't do this!
Vanessa, pull yourseIf together. You have to snap out of it!
you snap out of it.
you snap out of it.
you snap out of it! - You snap out of it!
you snap out of it! - You snap out of it!
you snap out of it! - You snap out of it!
hold it! - Why? Come on, it's my turn.
how is the plane flying?
I don't know.
Hello?
Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?
the Pollen Jocks!
they do get behind a fellow.
black and yellow. - Hello.
all right, let's drop this tin can on the blacktop.
where? I can't see anything. Can you?
no, nothing. It's all cloudy.
come on. You got to think bee, Barry.
thinking bee. - Thinking bee.
thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
wait a minute. I think I'm feeling something.
what? - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
bring the nose down.
thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
what in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that!
thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK.
out the engines. We're going in on bee power. Ready, boys?
Affirmative!
good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
land on that flower!
ready? Full reverse!
spin it around!
not that flower! The other one! - Which one?
that flower. - I'm aiming at the flower!
that's a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant puIsating flower made of millions of bees!
pull forward. Nose down. TaiI up.
rotate around it.
this is insane, Barry! - This's the only way I know how to fly.
am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?
get your nose in there. Don't be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!
just drop it. Be a part of it.
aim for the center!
now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
come on, already.
Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!
Yes. No high-five! - Right.
Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?
what giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!
thank you. - But we're not done yet.
listen, everyone!
this runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.
that means this is our last chance.
we're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.
if we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?
are we going to be bees, or just Museum of NaturaI History keychains?
we're bees!
keychain!
then follow me! Except Keychain.
hold on, Barry. Here.
you've earned this.
Yeah!
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
Oh, yeah.
that's our Barry.
mom! The bees are back!
if anybody needs to make a call, now's the time.
I got a feeling we'll be working late tonight!
here's your change. Have a great afternoon! Can I help who's next?
would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
milk, cream, cheese, it's all me. And I don't see a nickel!
sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!
I had no idea.
Barry, I'm sorry. Have you got a moment?
would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.
sorry I'm late.
he's a lawyer too?
I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.
have a great afternoon!
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can't get them anywhere.
no problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.
you're a lifesaver, Barry. Can I help who's next?
all right, scramble, jocks! It's time to fly.
thank you, Barry!
that bee is living my life!
let it go, Kenny.
when will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go.
beautiful day to fly. - Sure is.
between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.
you have got to start thinking bee, my friend.
thinking bee! - Me?
hold it. Let's just stop for a second. Hold it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone. Can we stop here?
I'm not making a major life decision during a production number!
but deliver us from evil."For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever."Amen.
you done?
what was that?
I think it was Marie.
what is it, sweetie? What's wrong?
daddy, Daddy, there was a man out there.
what? - What?
it's okay.
did you know him?
not really. I'd see him around from time to time.
I'd wave at him or his wife.
Oh, my God, his wife, his kids.
they're fine.
everyone except MR. Mulhearn here was in Chandler with one of the grandparents.
wife's on her way back now.
this is the third home invasion murder in the past month.
the first two happened in the Western Precinct so, uh, their homicide squad's handling the investigation, but this matches the M. O.Exactly.
someone pried open the back door, forced your neighbor here to open the family safe, and then put a bullet in the back of his head.
I know. I dreamt it last night.
th-the last part of it anyway.
but you mean you didn't come all the way out here to say hi?
so, uh... give me a description of the shooter.
I can do one better than that.
I can give you an eyewitness.
Hey, Mommy, what happened?
what's with all the cop cars outside in the middle of the night?
our neighbors, the Mulhearns-- somebody broke into their house.
are they okay?
well, it could have been worse. Only MR. Mulhearn was home.
Sweetie-- honey, the police are going to want to talk to you tomorrow about that man that you saw.
is he going to come back? - No, honey.
the people that I work with, they're going to catch him.
they're going to put him in jail.
okay, but can I please sleep with you guys tonight?
of course you can.
wait a second. Well, then who's going to sleep with me?
remember how when we first moved in here,
I'll call tomorrow.
I'm interested in Southfork because it combines the advantages of a small school with the benefits of a large public university.
the ratio of teachers to students is low, which is something I'm definitely looking for.
okay. What do you think?
does it sound weird talking about ratios?
maybe I should just say, like,"Class sizes" Or something.
I don't think it matters. I mean, you already rocked your SATs.
you really think this interview is that important?
it's for Southfork.
I mean, they're sending someone all the way down here to do it.
world themes is calling.
you ever read Beowulf?
Yeah, me either, and I'm about to have a test on it.
later. - Good luck.
Southfork, huh?
that's a good school.
tough to get into, though.
that's what I hear.
did you know that less than ten percent of the people who applied there last year got in?
those are brutal odds.
excuse me, do you work here?
are you a-a teacher or something?- No.
okay, so then what are you doing here?
why are you hanging around a high school library?
people are trying to study.
Oh, don't worry, nobody can hear us.
honest. Honest!
you're... - Yeah, as a doornail.
almost three months now. Heart attack.
tenth mile of a training run.
my name is Alan Hahn, Dr. Alan Hahn.
I was a... A professor of romantic literature at Southfork.
tenured professor.
head of the department actually.
okay. Well, then it's, um, it's really nice to meet you, I guess.
well, it's nice to meet you, too.
Ariel... I think I can help you get into Southfork.
in fact, I can pretty much guarantee that you'll get into Southfork.
Really?
how can you be so sure?
well, when I was alive, I was married to a woman named Sondra Hahn-Barker.
sound familiar?
she's interviewing me tomorrow.
Yes, Sondra is a very successful attorney. She's one of Southfork's must active alumni.
she's on the board of directors.
she's raised god knows how much money for that place If you get her stamp of approval, you are in - it's as simple as that.
and I can tell you exactly how to do it.
if you listen to me, you will give the interview of Sondra's life, 'cause I know just what she wants to hear.
okay, but... Why would you do that for me?
a very good and canny question.
it is, after all, a rather large favor.
in return for which, I'm asking only a small one.
at the interview, Sondra will have a laptop. It was mine.
there's a file on there I'd rather she not see.
when an opportunity presents itself-- and I know that one will
all you have to do is just delete the file.
how do you know that she'll leave me alone with that computer?
Oh, the same way I know that you're going to pass this interview with flying colors.
Yes, it's one of the few perks of my current condition.
what else do you need to know?
what's on this file that you want me to delete?
uh, it's personal.
it's, uh, no big deal. It's just-- it's embarrassing.
honestly, there's just some, uh, material I'd rather, you know, my wife not know about.
I think you-you understand what I'm talking about.
Yeah, I got the idea.
hello. Your security system is ready for activation.
cool. It talks.
sure does. The 2100 will even react to the sound of your voice, if your hands are full and you can't punch in your code.
okay, um...
your security system is armed.
once it's armed, and the sensor's been tripped, you have 20 seconds to turn it off before the alarm goes off.
automated VOICE: Your security system is disarmed.
what else does it say?
excuse me? - The alarm.
what else does it say?
uh, pretty much just " Armed" And "Disarmed.
I can set it up to tell you which alarm sensor's been tripped if you want.
can it say our name?
not quite there yet. Maybe next year's model.
all right, well, the alarm is set. Don't open a window unless you want the police here.
good to know.
you've been, uh, in there for 45 minutes.
what have you been doing?
I was making the Mulhearns lasagna.
I'm going to drop it off in the morning.
Oh, that poor woman.
I think her name is Amy.
I can't even imagine what she's dealing with right now.
losing her husband suddenly like that?
mommy?
I can't get tired. I'm still too scared.
you know we've got an alarm now, sweetie, right?
it's on and everything.
I know.
you want to sleep with us again tonight? Hmm?
all right. Come on, you little one.
your security system is armed. Your security system is disarmed.
your security system is armed.
you heard me. I said you're safe.
you could talk? - I sure can, Marie.
my name's Sal, and I'm here to protect you.
and I hope that you and I are going to be very good friends.
Allison, right?
um, I hope I'm not intruding.
thank you.
everyone's been so kind.
I can't tell you how much we appreciate it.
um, would you like to come inside? Another neighbor brought a deli tray by. I-I made coffee.
well, I would love to. I'm, I'm just a little late for work.
um, another time?
okay. - I've actually got to get going, too, Amy.
okay. Um... Allison, have you ever met Josh Berryman?
he lives right around the corner.
hate that we're meeting 'cause of this, but, uh, it's always nice to meet your neighbors.
take care, Amy.
Bye.
Berryman worked as a software consultant until his company went under;
that was about two years ago. Wife filed for divorce ten months ago.
does he have an alibi for the night of the Mulhearn murder?
Nope. Doesn't have one for the nights of the other two murders, either.
way Berryman tells it, he spends most nights watching TV at home by his lonesome.
still and all, I know this guy's broke, but, uh...
he just doesn't strike me as the home-invading, execution-style-murdering type.
it's him. He did it. He's the man I saw.
well, there's one way to find out for sure.
you ready?
okay, Marie, you see all those men in the room there?
let me tell you a secret.
you can see them, but they can't see you.
okay?
so all you have to do is point out the man that you saw running through your backyard, and the police here will take care of the rest.
all right? - All right.
good. So, do you see him?
no.
are you sure, sweetie? Maybe you want to take another look?
no, I don't think I remember.
Marie, sweetie, that man can't see you. You have nothing to be afraid of.
no, I don't remember his face, Mommy. I'm sorry.
but, honey, you looked right at him.
al. She said she doesn't see him.
...she really saw the guy? - Well, she did her best.
can we do that again tomorrow?
look, I know Marie saw that man's face. I just need a little more time to talk to her.
you mean nobody else has come forward to say they saw him?
no. And so far, forensics has nothing to tie him to the scene.
so, without your daughter's I. D.we got nothing on this guy.
you can't just let him go.
Allison, no one is questioning what you saw.
but there is simply not enough evidence to justify holding him.
he's a killer, sir.
he lives down the street from my family.
from my daughters!
all right. By law, I can hold him for 24 hours without charging him.
but if we don't find enough evidence between now and then...
you have to let him go; I understand.
those dorms, oh, my goodness.
which one is it - the one that was built in 1842?
well, that's Whitman Hall.
that's where I lived as a freshman.
you did? You're kidding.
no. Sorry.
Oh, it's my office; I'm going to have to take this.
I thought I'd be done by now.
I didn't expect to find someone so engaging.
do you want me to wait outside?
no, no. I'm gonna run to the ladies' room after. This'll just take a sec.
Hello, this is Sondra.
that's your cue, kiddo.
you got about 90 seconds.
are you sure this is the right file you want me to delete?
stop looking at it and just do it.
but I don't get it. Why do you want to delete a bunch of baby photos?
happy now?
just do it.
you were involved with this person.
and you lied to me.
you know what?
I already nailed that interview.
so I don't need to erase any of this for you.
fine. If you think my wife's life, or anyone's life, is gonna be made better by looking at those pictures, go ahead, just leave them.
but you've got eight seconds to decide.
all right, Ariel, ready to dive back in?
Absolutely.
you did very well in there today. I think you're a lock.
I just wanted to, you know, check in, make sure you're not thinking about doing anything rash.
you mean you want to know if I'm gonna tell your wife that you were involved with another woman and had a baby with her?
that's a bit presumptuous, isn't it, Ariel?
y-you don't know that that's my baby.
are you saying it isn't?
I'm saying, the paternity of that child has never been established. Not to my satisfaction.
not to your satisfaction?
is he your child, or isn't he?
I don't know how to answer that, Ariel.
that is a mystery which is now, sadly, lost to the sands of time.
you know, the woman, uh, you saw in those pictures-- I wasn't the only person she was dating at the time.
uh, Abby was a student of mine.
a very, uh, uh, popular student.
okay, but in those photos, she obviously thought that it was your child.
you-you know what? I'm not getting into this with you.
uh, have a wonderful life. Enjoy Southfork, hmm?
uh, and here comes my wonderful widow Sondra.
what's wrong, Marie?
there's no reason to be scared.
I told you I'd keep you safe.
I can't help it.
I understand.
it's a dangerous world out there.
that's why I'm here - to keep you safe.
to warn you about the bad guys, and to scare them away if they come too close.
and do you know why you're here?
to help me.
and that means you have to listen to what I say.
you have to do what I ask you to do.
because I'm the one in charge of keeping everyone safe.
you understand that... right, Marie?
that's easy to understand, isn't it?
you listen to me, and everything is fine.
you don't listen to me, and your whole family dies in their beds.
how's that sound?
Marie? What are you doing?
I couldn't sleep.
who were you talking to?
no one.
are you sure?
come here.
honey, if anyone ever threatened you, if anyone ever told you things to scare you about our family, you would tell me, right?
you know Mommy works with the police.
I would get them to put that person in jail.
and even if it wasn't a person, you would still tell me, right?
because you know, I would never let anyone or anything hurt you.
you know that, right?
Oh, honey... Were you talking to that alarm?
was the alarm talking to you? You can tell me.
it talks when you turn it on.
well, I-I know that, but other than that.
mommy, burglar alarms don't talk.
not really.
I'm gonna go back to bed now, okay?
okay, so the burglar alarm... is evil?
no, Joe, that's not what I'm saying.
not exactly.
okay. What are you saying exactly?
I'm saying that in my dreams, this thing is talking to our daughter, and I don't like what it's saying.
and I know how that sounds, but I've seen it.
I come in tonight. Marie is standing in front of the alarm.
and it's dark.
but I'm pretty certain that she was talking to it.
al, I'm having a hard time following you down the rabbit hole on this one.
I know this thing seems pretty high-tech because it talks, but it's act...
it's actually fairly simple.
in terms of programming power, it's about as sophisticated as the toaster oven.
smart people have been experimenting with artificial intelligence for decades now, but I doubt that anybody has cracked the problem, snuck it into a burglar alarm without telling anyone.
okay. Then why don't you explain why I'm seeing this?
the burden of proof is on me here?
Yeah. - Okay, fine.
if I had to guess, I would say that you are dreaming about what Marie is seeing in her imagination.
kids sometimes respond to trauma by creating imaginary friends.
Marie has been through a trauma, and if she's getting comfort by giving the burglar alarm a personality, by imagining it can keep us all safe, why is that such a big deal?
it's not comforting her, it's threatening her!
it's telling her that we're all gonna die.
and you know what? I don't care if you can't explain it.
I don't like it!
I'm gonna call the company tomorrow, and I'm gonna have them take it out.
well, hold on a second, Al.
we just spent $2, 200 on this thing.
I'm not saying we won't have an alarm. I just want a different model; One that doesn't talk.
your security system is armed.
who asked you?
Allison, what can I do for you?
did I just see Josh Berryman in here?
you sure did.
we released him this morning, so I asked him to come by so I could personally apologize for any inconvenience or embarrassment...
apologize? - You didn't see the paper this morning, did you?
there was another home invasion last night in El Mirage.
they cleaned out the safe and shot a retired couple in the back of the head.
since MR. Berryman was in our custody last night, it seems unlikely that he was involved.
that, plus the utter paucity of any evidence against him, well, there's really no basis on which to hold him.
but I saw him do it.
that's all well and good.
no, no, no, you're not hearing me.
obviously, it wasn't him last night.
I don't know if he committed these other murders, but I know he killed my neighbor.
I saw him do it.
I can even tell you exactly where the murder weapon is.
what are you doing?
I thought we had a deal.
Yeah, I thought I was supposed to help you get rid of some porn.
yeah-- is this about the baby? Are you still upset about the baby?
the paternity of that child has never been established.
all I know is that that information was on your computer when you died.
okay, so maybe your wife was supposed to find it. I'm not sure.
I'm just sure that I was never supposed to remove it.
you think that's going to make a difference? That kid is nothing to Sondra.
my family's obligation to that boy died when I did.
Yeah, well, that's not up to me to decide.
and you don't know.
maybe she'll want to help.
y-you're talking about my wife?
that woman sues people for a living.
she would personally kill the last baby seal on the planet if she thought there was a dollar in it for her.
that, that kid is nothing to Sondra.
she'll do nothing for that kid.
maybe she will, maybe she won't.
it's not up to me.
you might as well stop talking because there is nothing that you can do to stop me.
Oh, I know that.
I'm not trying to stop you. I'm just trying to, uh, delay you.
Mrs. Hahn-Barker.
uh, great, I've been waiting for you.
you have?
uh, yeah.
sorry, my, uh, my dad said that he'd, uh, get me a laptop when I go to college, so, yeah, I just saw it lying here and, and wanted to check it out.
I, uh, I got home the other day and realized that I wanted to send you a thank-you note, uh, thanking you for taking the trouble to interview me, uh, and then I realized that I don't have a home or business address to send it.
that's completely unnecessary.
here's my card.
Thanks.
you gave a great interview the other day.
Southfork is very excited about you.
thank you. Bye.
hello.
Yeah, I just wanted to let you know I'm right around the corner from your place.
I'd ask if I can stop by for dinner, except I smell like I've been rooting around in a sewer all day, which is exactly what I've been doing.
tell me you found the gun.
I wish I could.
we searched that grate you pointed out to us and then we poked our heads down every manhole on the block.
you'd be surprised at some of the things your neighbors flush down the toilet, but there's no gun down there.
I don't understand. It was sitting there, I saw it sitting there.
I don't know what to tell you, Allison. If there was a murder weapon down there, it's gone.
that's good, Marie.
you're a very cooperative little girl.
al, what the hell are you doing out here?
I'm looking for something.
what?
this.
this is the gun that Josh Berryman used to kill Matt Mulhearn.
I think Marie put it in here.
I think tha-that alarm told her to.
no, I didn't.
Marie, I know you did. I saw you put that gun in the trash can.
look, honey, I'm not mad at you.
I just want you to tell me what happened.
don't look at that alarm, you look at me.
look, I know you're scared.
I know that thing has been talking to you, but it cannot hurt you.
it cannot hurt us.
I need you to tell me what it told you to do.
you're scaring me, Mommy. Burglar alarms do not talk.
well, that one does, and we both know it does.
okay, come on, Marie, why don't you go back, see if you can get a little more sleep?
we will talk about this later, okay?
I'm sorry, Mommy.
she's lying!
this thing is making my daughter lie to me!
for God's sake, are you listening to yourself?
I am getting rid of that thing right now.
what are you talking about? They're coming to replace it the day after tomorrow.
do you know how to dismantle that thing?
I can cut some wires.
no. Okay, just do me a favor - give it to me.
if you're dead set on doing this, at least take advantage of the fact you're married to an engineer.
and you do me a favor - don't shock me or anything.
very funny.
just don't ask me where I found it.
am I allowed to ask you what it is?
it's the gun that Josh Berryman used to kill Matt Mulhearn.
look, I know another crime happened while he was in custody.
I know you made nice with the guy yesterday.
just run whatever tests you need to.
you'll see I'm right.
Mrs. Hahn-Barker. I thought you were, uh, were heading home.
I delayed my flight for a couple of hours.
I wanted to speak with you about something.
uh... sure.
I found a file on my computer yesterday, and I think that you put it there.
it's the only possibility that makes any sense.
thank you for not bothering to deny it.
do you know her?
the young woman in the photos?
no, I never met her.
she said the same thing about you.
I spoke with her.
if, in fact, that young boy is my late husband's son...
I've decided to take some of the money that Alan left behind to provide for him.
I'm glad.
so if you didn't know the girl, then you must have known Alan.
putting that file on my computer for me to find, I can only assume you had some score to settle with him.
I've learned an awful lot about my late husband over the last 24 hours.
I can't imagine what would have brought you to Oregon or to Southfork.
the summer program for high schoolers, I'm guessing.
so which one of his lectures on romantic literature reeled you in?
sense and Sensibility?
the Lady of the Lake? That was always one of my favorites.
the Scarlet Letter?
no, I've never been to Oregon.
I have never heard your late husband's lecture.
and I swear that I never met him while he was alive.
you what want to know what should have been my first clue?
your interview.
all those carefully polished answers. You sounded exactly like him.
it is a shame. I liked you.
I actually felt good about championing you to the Director of Admissions.
well... I have a plane to catch.
stop that.
you brought this on yourself.
you didn't need to get involved with him. You didn't need his help.
no.
you're a smart girl.
you're going to get into some wonderful school.
just not this one.
why did you guys rip the alarm off of the wall?
you want to field that one, dear?
it wasn't working right.
O-Kay. But why isn't Marie coming out of our room?
I think she misses the alarm.
okay. - Go get your sisters.
I know Marie's in mourning, but she still has to eat.
Hello?
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you before you left.
I wanted you to know you were right.
according to Forensics, that gun you brought in was used to execute Matt Mulhearn.
sir, that's great news.
I'm not finished.
now, we can tie the weapon to the murder, but not to the man you believe pulled the trigger.
I'm afraid that the gun was wiped clean of fingerprints before you brought it in.
also, the serial number was filed away, so there's no way to trace it.
bottom line is, we simply cannot connect it to Josh Berryman in any way.
so he just gets away with it?
in the absence of further developments, I'm afraid so.
look, I know this hits you quite literally close to home, and I want you to know how sorry I am.
I understand, sir. Thank you.
so, I-I did like you told me.
I-I went to the bar in Avondale, and I bought this from a guy who deals drugs in the parking lot.
and, um, I went to the bank.
um, I-I got a safe deposit box.
but, you know, don't-don't worry, because I-I-I won't spend it till a couple months after the job's done.
but, uh... You got the money, right?
I guess it's really gonna happen, I guess. I'm actually... Gonna kill someone.
listen.
calm down.
it's going to be fine.
just be sure you... Shoot me in the back of the head.
we need it to look like the other break-ins.
so now you know.
I hired Josh to kill me.
that voice.
you sound exactly like... - The burglar alarm?
Yeah.
I'm the man behind the curtain.
I'm Sal.
I apologize for using your daughter.
but after Josh shot me, it became pretty clear that you were going to lead the police to the truth.
and I couldn't let that happen.
she was so fascinated by that alarm.
she really wanted to believe it could talk.
you manipulated my child?
you bullied her so she wouldn't identify Josh in the lineup?
you put a gun in my baby's hands!
I did. And again, I apologize.
but what was I going to do?
Josh left his prints all over that gun, even though I told him never to handle it without gloves on.
and he was supposed to dump it in a lake, not in a sewer grate, where it would just sit there until a city worker found it.
hey... I get that you're angry with me.
but believe it or not, I had a really good reason for doing what I did.
you're not even a little bit curious?
you don't even want to know why I hired someone to shoot me in the head?
not really. Not now.
at the moment, all I really want to do is call the people I work with and tell them about a drug dealer in Avondale who sold Josh the gun.
Oh, and this, uh, brand-new safety deposit box that's got $20, 000 in it.
I had Huntington's disease.
do you know anything about Huntington's?
it's genetic.
I got it from my dad.
you wake up one day, and you don't have control of your body anymore.
your-your limbs move.
they dance.
they writhe.
in the old days, they thought people who had it were possessed by a demon.
there's no cure.
there's barely even a treatment.
it's just a slow, terrible death.
and your family, they get front-row seats.
there was no way I was putting Amy and the kids through that.
not after what I saw with my dad.
so when I realized, I had it, I decided to bow out gracefully.
problem was, I couldn't kill myself.
life insurance doesn't pay out for a suicide, and Amy and the kids really need that money.
I knew Josh was in a pinch.
so he and I, we came to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
an "Arrangement?" Is that what you call it?
you abandoned your family.
you left your wife to see you lying in a pool of your own blood.
I know, it wasn't pretty.
but believe me, it was a lot better than the alternative.
I-I know that you're angry with me.
but this crime that you're running around trying to solve?
it's really just a case of assisted suicide.
with, I'll grant you, a little-- a little insurance fraud thrown in.
but there's no murder here.
not when you really think about it.
you know, if you're not lying, if you really were sick, I'm sorry.
but I have no reason to trust you.
and, you know, it's really the courts who decide whether or not your death was a murder.
your call.
but if you keep dialing, you lose the chance to cooperate with me.
cooperate with you on what?
on what? Did you forget?
Allison, there's a real murderer out there.
he's already robbed and killed five people.
and I'm pretty sure he has no intention of stopping.
one of the only nice things about being dead?
gives you a hell of a vantage point from which to watch the living.
I know an awful lot about this guy.
I can tell you his name, where he lives, where he works.
I know where he hides the stuff he stole from his victims.
I can even tell you the name of the nice, young couple he's planning on hitting next.
if I agree to ignore what you and Josh did.
what's his name?
what?
nothing. I... I was just thinking about what an interesting person you are.
it's kind of a shame we didn't get a chance to know each other, living so close and all.
name.
you should go get a piece of paper.
you're going to want to get all this down.
what happened last week: Quinn told Finn...
I'm pregnant.
but she didn't tell him that he's not the father.
puck is. Can you believe that? - What's up, MILF?
but that's not the only baby drama.
Terri says she's pregnant, but really she's faking.
and Mr. Shuester doesn't know. - Oh, my God.
also, Rachel quit the glee club because Sue got Sandy to come back to direct a musical.
and that's what you missed on...
william McKinley High Glee Club INVITATIONAL
Quinn, you okay?
I think she just had a bad breakfast burrito.
can we please talk about the giant elephant in the room?
your sexuality?
Rachel... we can't do it without her.
that's not true.
we may have to layer Santana and Mercedes over Quinn's solo but... we'll be fine.
maybe for the invitationals, but not for the sectionals and certainly not the regionals.
the wheelchair kid's right.
that Rachel chick makes me want to light myself on fire, but she can sing.
Rachel left, guys.
she's gone.
now, if we're gonna make this thing work, we can't look back.
all right, take five, guys.
um, Mr. Shue?
I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but, uh...
with all the dancing around that Quinn's doing...
I'm kind of worried about the baby.
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
how about I give Tina a few of her verses, okay?
okay.
you think you might want to tell your mom about what's going on?
I think I'd rather handle it myself right now.
my mom's got enough to worry about.
how come you haven't had any morning sickness?
Quinn Fabray has been upchucking every 15 minutes.
Really?
that's a really good sign.
that means the baby's not a Mongoloid.
well, is it bad that you haven't been sick then?
Oh, no, honey, no, no.
you should ask Howard Bamboo about my Linda Blair impersonations every half hour at work.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this whole Rachel thing.
Hey. Would you like anything else?
another piece of grasshopper pie.
what, are you going for the record?
I'm with child.
Hey, did you go to McKinley High?
I think I had you in my Spanish class.
Yeah, like, five years ago.
I go to Carmel now.
how is that possible?
you must be 22.- Twenty-four.
I'm a sixth-year senior.
they keep failing me so I can stay in Vocal Adrenaline.
they fail you on purpose?
yeah - Is that legal?
I'm the only one who can do the triple flip.
Yeah. Hey, how about that other piece of pie?
how about it.
honey, are you all right?
Yeah.
fine.
so... have I done something wrong... or...?
Oh, no. No, no. Absolutely not.
no, um, actually,
I've just, um, taken a special interest in you.
look, I know sometimes that life can come at you pretty fast, and, uh, you reach a point where you might just need a little, um, special guidance.
has someone told you something about my personal life?
no. Mm-mm.
can you keep a secret?
but, you know, there are very few students that ever get athletic scholarships.
okay? But there are a lot of schools that give full rides to students who excel in music.
students like yourself.
and I don't know, maybe if you were able to go to college, you wouldn't, say, end up stuck in this town in a dead-end job living hand- to-mouth with a wife and a kid you never intended to have, you know?
for example. That's just something off the top of my head.
so you think if I stuck with Glee that I could get a scholarship?
it's definitely a possibility.
you know? And if you did well at regionals, maybe you could, um, generate some interest.
but we lost Rachel. Do you think we can do it without her?
sure.
do you think we can win regionals without Rachel?
well, remember the Jamaican bobsled team?
big long shots.
definitely.
but if you're concerned about your future and, um, those who may be a part of your future soon, um, maybe you could just give Rachel a talk.
you know, see if you can get her to come back.
how does it feel to be just a sophomore and get the lead in the school musical?
it's an honor.
frankly, one I feel I've earned.
if there's anything I've learned in my 16 years on the stage, it's that stars are rare, and when they're found, you have to let them shine.
show me your bra.
you mean the one I'm wearing?
quid pro quo, Rachel.
if you want a good review, show me your over the shoulder boulder holder.
no way. You can't do that.
my performance will stand on its own.
besides, no one reads the school paper, anyway.
Oh, but I'll post my scathing review online.
you'll be finished on the high school stage.
now, get those sweater puppies out of their cashmere cage.
sorry I'm late.
my Vespa had a flat.
give me a minute and I will be ready for my interview.
we're actually not gonna need any quotes from you for the article, Mr. Ryerson.
do the right thing.
all the great actresses take their clothes off.
well, I have no problem with nudity.
let me tell you about my planned production of Equus.
have you ever hung out at a stable?
Hey, what are you doing? - Nothing. Uh, just...
getting the star treatment I didn't get in Glee.
totally.
it's times like this where I know I've chosen the right path.
I'm never going back to Glee.
it's clear my talent is too big for an ensemble.
not gonna get an argument from me.
I'm not?
no. You're, like, the most talented person I know.
even more than that guy at the mall who can juggle chain saws.
I just wanted to let you know that if you need someone to run lines with,
I'm available.
th-there is a lot of dialogue.
I figured...
we could go somewhere quiet, maybe with low lighting and...
let me know.
I could get fired for this.
she was a student 15 years ago.
no one is gonna care.
okay.
I - I knew it.
she never graduated.
She-she quit with, like, three credits to go.
Yeah, I,um, I saw her picture in the folder.
pretty.
pretty?
april Rhodes was a goddess.
the most talented performer in McKinley Glee Club history.
when she sang, it was mesmerizing.
she was my first crush.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.
wait, hold on, 'cause I thought you said your wife was your first crush.
well, yeah, that's because April didn't even look at me.
Aw, crap, there's no forwarding address.
s- So then you've-you've had feelings for someone other than your wife.
Emma, I'd love to play This Is Your Life, but Lord Google demands my attention.
okay, just wait-wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
um, reaching back into your past is a dangerous business, okay?
people can change.
they can, um, disappoint you...
I think I can handle it.
I thought I could, too. Just hear me out, hear me out.
a few years ago, I started an online flirtation with a high school flame Andy.
things got weird, and I called it off.
and two months later...
...Versace was dead.
dead.
okay.
april Rhodes... Ohio.
Oh! She has a MySpace page.
Oh, God.
Oh, and here's a link to her own personal Web site.
she's online.
Hi, April.
not sure if you remember me, but my name is Will Schuester.
35 Bontempo Road, between 2: 00 and 3: 00.
bring buffalo wings.
hello. Are you Will?
y - You remember me?
Mm. No, but I don't remember breakfast.
come on in.
so, did I sleep with you?
uh, I was a freshman when you were a senior. No.
so, did I sleep with you?
no
can I get you a drink?
I just cracked open a fresh box of wine.
this is a-a great place you have.
uh, looks like you're doing well for yourself.
I get about five or six appointments on a good day from my World Wide Web page, so I do okay for myself.
why don't you have a seat, take off that jacket, and I'm gonna slip into something a little more comfortable.
so, this is a beautiful five-bedroom with wood-burning fireplace and...
you.
this is the third time this week.
who are you? I'm Sandra with Oak crest Realty.
and she is a squatter.
this is a bank - owned property.
the owners foreclosed six months ago.
let me just get my vino, and I'll be out of your hair.
hold that. - Oh, okay.
just...
nice place.
can I ask you a question? - Yeah.
what happened to you, April?
in high school, you were really going places.
you had a voice like a dream; everyone loved you.
Oh, I hitched my star to the wrong wagon.
me and my high school sweetheart Vinny were convinced we were going to be stars, so we dropped out of school and hitchhiked our way to the Broadway.
then we ended up in Cleveland slinging hash at Ralph's Bait Shop and Waffle House.
then Ralph had an affair with Vinny.
I had a set of mixed-race twins.
and those were the good times.
April... I think your struggle is really moving.
and I want to help you get back on your feet.
I happen to know that you're only three credits shy of your diploma.
I can put you in my Spanish class.
and...
I know you're an amazing singer.
I want you to be in the glee club.
we'll get you sobered up...
find you some underwear.
it's not too late for you, April.
what do you say?
introduce you to someone very special.
this is April Rhodes.
she's our newest member.
wait, so old people can join Glee Club now?
old, huh?
you guys look like the world's worst Benetton ad.
Mr. Schuester, this seems like a terrible idea.
april is a great singer.
and she never graduated.
we appreciate what you're trying to do, but she's no Rachel.
who's Rachel?
Sh-She's kind of our star.
your star, eh?
well, where is she? - She left.
to be the lead in Cabaret.
Hey, Tinkles, give me "Maybe This Time" in B flat.
and don't let me catch you snoozing.
april.
I guess I better pour myself another Crantini.
I'm just kidding. It's hot chocolate.
all right, remember, guys, oral reports Wednesday.
april, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm sorry, Will.
the old noodle just ain't what she used to be.
I huffed a lot of upholstery cleaner in the '90s.
look, April,
I've been, uh, talking to the glee kids, and, um, I think they're still not so sure about having you around.
you draw a lot of attention to yourself.
and they're embarrassed enough as it is.
so do you think you could maybe take some time and try to win them over?
Yeah.
mm, smells like my Aunt Mildred.
just drink it.
with a bit of an after-burny taste.
Oh, good Chablis should always have a little bite.
now, a few swigs of that every day before school, and you'll have all the courage you need to be yourself.
Really? - Oh, yeah.
that's fantastic.
mm, so is my primo collection of vintage muscle magazines.
want them?
Mr. Schuester, I changed my mind.
april should stay.
I worship her.
I c-can't do this.
I don't understand why we're doing this in the first place.
your lack of imagination astounds me.
this is only the beginning.
if you can master this, you can sneak anything out of a store between your knees.
shoes, prom dresses.
I once got a cake out of a kid's birthday party.
with the candles still lit.
are you sure?
she can stay.
t- T-Totally.
this is terrible.
come hear the music play - This is a disaster - Life is a cabaret - I'm gonna barf.
old chum - Boring - Come to the cabaret - No, no, no, no, no!
I don't know what you want.
well, I know what I don't want.
and it is all of this.
when I gave you this part, I thought you could handle it, but clearly you can't.
what this show needs is a star with a little bit more maturity.
I know what you're trying to do.
you're trying to get me to quit, so you can be the star.
well, it won't work.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll say.
I'm sleeping with him. - So am I.
this play's weird.
that's Mr. Ryerson's favorite line.
you're a really good actor, Finn.
maybe you should consider joining the musical.
I'm pretty devoted to Glee.
I don't think I could just walk away from it.
I know how hard it was for you.
but I could justify doing both if you came back.
but we both know that's not gonna happen.
do you know what we should do?
elope?
what? - Nothing.
we should go bowling.
you're always so stressed out about the play.
you just need to loosen up.
I always go bowling whenever I'm worked up about a big game or something.
just us?
Yeah.
Yeah, that-that-that would be great.
I - I am really stressed out.
but that's the price you pay for being a star.
don't I know it.
april Rhodes, Rachel Berry.
Hey, can you give us the room, Rachel?
we need to teach April the cues for "Don't Stop Believing."
wait, she's singing the female lead?
wait, she's in the glee club?
she's... ancient.
talent doesn't age, sweetheart.
that's Rachel's part, Mr. Shue.
well, Rachel's not in the glee club anymore.
Thanks, Finn.
we're all really excited to see the play.
make sure you save us a seat in the front row.
Kurt, I'm a girl who knows her solvents, and your breath smells like rubbing alcohol.
Oh, Bambi.
I cried so hard when those hunters shot your mommy.
Hey, Em. Just trying to figure out the set list for Saturday.
I just got back from the emergency room.
had them give me four decontamination showers.
I think they call that "the full Silkwood."
what happened?
Kurt was drunk and he ralphed on me.
not really fessing up to how he got the booze just yet, but I'm pretty sure it's not a fake ID, because he looks like an 11-year-old milkmaid.
will, I think it was April.
her backpack's always clinking with empties.
I'm so sorry.
I - I will, I'll talk to him.
okay.
I'm, um,
I'm a little bit worried about the glee club.
so am I. I mean...
if we don't place at regionals, it-it's all over.
we have obligations as teachers, Will, to give kids opportunities for growth and enrichment.
with April in Glee, you're taking away a kid's chance to grow, and you're giving it to someone whose brain is soaked in corn booze.
april's not finished, Emma.
and if Glee's gonna win, I need to give her a second chance.
she is a talented performer and I really think that the kids are going to learn a lot of valuable technique from her.
okay.
but I think you need to think about...
why you're doing this and what you're willing to sacrifice to get it.
you...
suck!
rough day at the office, cookie?
I've just got a lot on my plate.
it's not easy being in the spotlight.
it's the difficult road I've chosen.
I know that song, sister.
um, do you have any NyQuil?
I could use a little pick-me-up.
these high school boys are a lot hotter than they used to be.
that Finn Hudson is one cutie pie I gots my eye on.
Finn's taken, April.
Yeah, well, some guys like a little somethin' - somethin' on the side.
I think your behavior is totally inappropriate and your presence in this school is a complete travesty.
what you choose to do with your life is your own business, but don't go around screwing up everyone else's.
I'm not afraid of you, sweetie.
there was a time when I was the biggest star around here.
and now that I've got that back...
I'm never letting it go.
do I have to put my fingers in the holes?
couldn't there be diseases in there or something?
Oh, no. Ball sharing's all part of the fun.
here, use the pink one.
pink's your favorite color, right?
now what?
follow my lead.
just look at the pins.
nice and straight.
you sure this is your first time?
you see what you can accomplish when you're sober?
sober? I'm rolling on a fistful of horse tranquilizers.
I can't feel my lips.
I think I'm going to keep these shoes.
I brought you here because I need to talk to you.
okay.
I'm concerned that you're a bad influence on the glee club.
I can't have you around if you're going to continue to encourage them to make bad choices.
you're right, Will.
as of right now, I'm back on the wagon.
Really?
that's great.
I have to tell you something.
I was in awe of you in high school.
I mean, of all the roads I never traveled in my life, the one I regret the most was never...
getting the chance to sing with you.
Really?
Yeah. I mean, that's how you get better, you know?
singing with people who are better than you.
you really thought that much of me?
you are the reason I joined Glee Club.
no...
so, your dream was always to sing with me, huh?
Yeah.
well, then, come on.
what? - Come on!
Hey, April, karaoke's on Wednesdays...
tonight's bingo.
shut your gravy hole, Barry.
Hey, guys, uh, happy gambling.
here we go.
this is really good pizza.
Yeah. I think they import the pepperoni from, like, Michigan or something.
how's Glee?
Oh, well, everybody misses you.
they miss my talent.
no, no. We're your friends.
we just miss having you around.
I love Glee, I just...
don't see the point in wasting my energies on someplace that I'm not appreciated.
I appreciate you.
it's your last ball.
just like the first time, but better.
come back to Glee.
what about Quinn?
I don't know what's going to happen in the future.
I just know that I want to spend more time with you now.
I'll-I'll have to quit the play.
I'll do it!
maybe Quinn is... There's a lactose intolerant.
that doesn't explain all the crying.
maybe she just doesn't like the group.
are you all that stupid?
Seriously?
I bet you thought Bert and Ernie were just roommates.
maybe Quinn's got one in the oven.
who's the baby's daddy?
who do you think?
Yes, you've heard right... I am returning to Glee Club.
in lieu of flowers, please send all donations to a socially conscious charity of your choice.
this is a hot damn mess.
Oh, my God.
uh, I'm sorry; I thought I'd be welcomed back with a tad more enthusiasm.
sorry, Glee Club has just been rocked with its first scandal.
Quinn's knocked up.
and the baby daddy?
I just wanted to drop off the application for that scholarship you were telling me about.
I got Rachel to come back to Glee, so, I figure we have a real shot at it.
I'm so proud of you.
see what you can accomplish when you set your mind to it?
you're a liar.
why didn't you tell me Quinn was pregnant?
who told you? - Everyone knows but me.
I'm the only fool who went out with you and let you kiss me, thinking you actually had feelings for me.
but I-I do.
look, yeah, I haven't been totally honest with you, but that's different than lying.
well, maybe it's not that much different, but...
but look, I need to get a music scholarship, so I can go to college, so I can get a good job, so I can take care of my kid and I can't do that if you don't come back to Glee Club.
you should take it as a compliment.
you could have just been honest with me.
look, I know what I did was wrong.
I get that, but... that kiss was real.
whatever it was, it ruined any chance of me ever coming back to Glee.
I hope you have fun playing house with Quinn while you languish in your little ensemble, but my dreams are bigger than that and they're bigger than you.
miss Sylvester.
we need to talk.
if you'd like to to return to the musical, changes need to be made.
well, Rachel, I couldn't agree with you more.
you know, when I heard Sandy wanted to write himself into a scene as Queen Cleopatra,
I was aroused, then furious.
I hereby grant you complete artistic control.
congratulations, kiddo.
you now have everything you could possibly want.
isn't it a great feeling?
the house is packed... you guys are going to kick butt tonight.
your first performance in front of a real audience.
I can't wait. You guys are going to love it.
Where-Where's April?- Yee-haw!
right on cue, as usual.
Hey, roller-boy. Handsome.
Oh, I like that color.
have you been working on the, uh, moves we talked...
you've got something right there, on your...
there's my boy. - Are you drunk?
you promised me you'd sober up for this.
when? Last night?
well, I was drunk. You can't hold me to that.
hit it, knuckles.
april Rhodes almost ran me over in the parking lot just now, Will.
you can't let her go on in her condition.
there is an auditorium full of people waiting to see us perform and if she doesn't go on, none of the kids can.
Wow. It's really great how committed you are to these kids.
now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome McKinley High School's New Directions.
I need to talk to you.
sorry. Baby had to tinkle.
come on. Act two. - No, I can't let you go back out there.
you broke a promise.
you're right.
it's a great moment for me, but it didn't feel right.
I don't belong up there.
but everybody deserves their moment in the spotlight, you know, to shine?
Oh, I got that standing ovation, Will.
and it felt amazing.
like every bad decision I'd ever made just went away.
I was back in the game.
but then I look over and I see these sweet faces of these kids and I think...
I'm hogging their sunshine.
it's their turn now, not yours.
they're so lucky to have you, Will, because you won't let what happened to me ever happen to any of them.
so, where you gonna go?
I'm going to straighten up.
maybe try to find a new dream.
you know, I always loved the Broadway.
the Broadway?
do you think there's a part out there for a washed-up has-been like me?
april, you are not washed-up.
and hey, there's always Branson.
thank you.
no, no, no.
thank you.
Branson, eh?
they loved us! We're a hit.
Wh-Wh-Where's April?
you were right, Mr. Shue.
she'd massacre Mariah in a diva-off.
april is amazing.
but she's not in the glee club anymore.
it...
I, uh...
I screwed up bringing her here.
it was about me and Glee Club is supposed to be about you guys.
you don't need her to be great.
but we need her for the second act.
I'll just have to go out there and tell them we had to cut the show short.
Hey, guys.
you were great.
don't worry.
there will be other performances.
excuse me?
I think I might have a solution.
in show business, when a star can't perform, her understudy steps in.
I'd be happy to go in for April, if you'd let me.
since when are you willing to be an understudy?
since I quit the play.
Really? Why?
I realized being a star didn't make me feel as special as being your friend.
if I'd let you down when you needed me the most,
I'd never forgive myself.
I know all the words to the song.
you don't know the choreography.
then we're going to have to give her a lot of help out there.
go get in your costume.
what happened last week: Quinn told Finn...
I'm pregnant.
but she didn't tell him that he's not the father.
puck is. Can you believe that? - What's up, MILF?
but that's not the only baby drama.
Terri says she's pregnant, but really she's faking.
and Mr. Shuester doesn't know. - Oh, my God.
also, Rachel quit the glee club because Sue got Sandy to come back to direct a musical.
and that's what you missed on...
william McKinley High Glee Club INVITATIONAL
Quinn, you okay?
I think she just had a bad breakfast burrito.
can we please talk about the giant elephant in the room?
your sexuality?
Rachel... we can't do it without her.
that's not true.
we may have to layer Santana and Mercedes over Quinn's solo but... we'll be fine.
maybe for the invitationals, but not for the sectionals and certainly not the regionals.
the wheelchair kid's right.
that Rachel chick makes me want to light myself on fire, but she can sing.
Rachel left, guys.
she's gone.
now, if we're gonna make this thing work, we can't look back.
all right, take five, guys.
um, Mr. Shue?
I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but, uh...
with all the dancing around that Quinn's doing...
I'm kind of worried about the baby.
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
how about I give Tina a few of her verses, okay?
okay.
you think you might want to tell your mom about what's going on?
I think I'd rather handle it myself right now.
my mom's got enough to worry about.
how come you haven't had any morning sickness?
Quinn Fabray has been upchucking every 15 minutes.
Really?
that's a really good sign.
that means the baby's not a Mongoloid.
well, is it bad that you haven't been sick then?
Oh, no, honey, no, no.
you should ask Howard Bamboo about my Linda Blair impersonations every half hour at work.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this whole Rachel thing.
Hey. Would you like anything else?
another piece of grasshopper pie.
what, are you going for the record?
I'm with child.
Hey, did you go to McKinley High?
I think I had you in my Spanish class.
Yeah, like, five years ago.
I go to Carmel now.
how is that possible?
you must be 22.- Twenty-four.
I'm a sixth-year senior.
they keep failing me so I can stay in Vocal Adrenaline.
they fail you on purpose?
yeah - Is that legal?
I'm the only one who can do the triple flip.
Yeah. Hey, how about that other piece of pie?
how about it.
honey, are you all right?
Yeah.
fine.
so... have I done something wrong... or...?
Oh, no. No, no. Absolutely not.
no, um, actually,
I've just, um, taken a special interest in you.
look, I know sometimes that life can come at you pretty fast, and, uh, you reach a point where you might just need a little, um, special guidance.
has someone told you something about my personal life?
no. Mm-mm.
can you keep a secret?
but, you know, there are very few students that ever get athletic scholarships.
okay? But there are a lot of schools that give full rides to students who excel in music.
students like yourself.
and I don't know, maybe if you were able to go to college, you wouldn't, say, end up stuck in this town in a dead-end job living hand- to-mouth with a wife and a kid you never intended to have, you know?
for example. That's just something off the top of my head.
so you think if I stuck with Glee that I could get a scholarship?
it's definitely a possibility.
you know? And if you did well at regionals, maybe you could, um, generate some interest.
but we lost Rachel. Do you think we can do it without her?
sure.
do you think we can win regionals without Rachel?
well, remember the Jamaican bobsled team?
big long shots.
definitely.
but if you're concerned about your future and, um, those who may be a part of your future soon, um, maybe you could just give Rachel a talk.
you know, see if you can get her to come back.
how does it feel to be just a sophomore and get the lead in the school musical?
it's an honor.
frankly, one I feel I've earned.
if there's anything I've learned in my 16 years on the stage, it's that stars are rare, and when they're found, you have to let them shine.
show me your bra.
you mean the one I'm wearing?
quid pro quo, Rachel.
if you want a good review, show me your over the shoulder boulder holder.
no way. You can't do that.
my performance will stand on its own.
besides, no one reads the school paper, anyway.
Oh, but I'll post my scathing review online.
you'll be finished on the high school stage.
now, get those sweater puppies out of their cashmere cage.
sorry I'm late.
my Vespa had a flat.
give me a minute and I will be ready for my interview.
we're actually not gonna need any quotes from you for the article, Mr. Ryerson.
do the right thing.
all the great actresses take their clothes off.
well, I have no problem with nudity.
let me tell you about my planned production of Equus.
have you ever hung out at a stable?
Hey, what are you doing? - Nothing. Uh, just...
getting the star treatment I didn't get in Glee.
totally.
it's times like this where I know I've chosen the right path.
I'm never going back to Glee.
it's clear my talent is too big for an ensemble.
not gonna get an argument from me.
I'm not?
no. You're, like, the most talented person I know.
even more than that guy at the mall who can juggle chain saws.
I just wanted to let you know that if you need someone to run lines with,
I'm available.
th-there is a lot of dialogue.
I figured...
we could go somewhere quiet, maybe with low lighting and...
let me know.
I could get fired for this.
she was a student 15 years ago.
no one is gonna care.
okay.
I - I knew it.
she never graduated.
She-she quit with, like, three credits to go.
Yeah, I,um, I saw her picture in the folder.
pretty.
pretty?
april Rhodes was a goddess.
the most talented performer in McKinley Glee Club history.
when she sang, it was mesmerizing.
she was my first crush.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.
wait, hold on, 'cause I thought you said your wife was your first crush.
well, yeah, that's because April didn't even look at me.
Aw, crap, there's no forwarding address.
s- So then you've-you've had feelings for someone other than your wife.
Emma, I'd love to play This Is Your Life, but Lord Google demands my attention.
okay, just wait-wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
um, reaching back into your past is a dangerous business, okay?
people can change.
they can, um, disappoint you...
I think I can handle it.
I thought I could, too. Just hear me out, hear me out.
a few years ago, I started an online flirtation with a high school flame Andy.
things got weird, and I called it off.
and two months later...
...Versace was dead.
dead.
okay.
april Rhodes... Ohio.
Oh! She has a MySpace page.
Oh, God.
Oh, and here's a link to her own personal Web site.
she's online.
Hi, April.
not sure if you remember me, but my name is Will Schuester.
35 Bontempo Road, between 2: 00 and 3: 00.
bring buffalo wings.
hello. Are you Will?
y - You remember me?
Mm. No, but I don't remember breakfast.
come on in.
so, did I sleep with you?
uh, I was a freshman when you were a senior. No.
so, did I sleep with you?
no
can I get you a drink?
I just cracked open a fresh box of wine.
this is a-a great place you have.
uh, looks like you're doing well for yourself.
I get about five or six appointments on a good day from my World Wide Web page, so I do okay for myself.
why don't you have a seat, take off that jacket, and I'm gonna slip into something a little more comfortable.
so, this is a beautiful five-bedroom with wood-burning fireplace and...
you.
this is the third time this week.
who are you? I'm Sandra with Oak crest Realty.
and she is a squatter.
this is a bank - owned property.
the owners foreclosed six months ago.
let me just get my vino, and I'll be out of your hair.
hold that. - Oh, okay.
just...
nice place.
can I ask you a question? - Yeah.
what happened to you, April?
in high school, you were really going places.
you had a voice like a dream; everyone loved you.
Oh, I hitched my star to the wrong wagon.
me and my high school sweetheart Vinny were convinced we were going to be stars, so we dropped out of school and hitchhiked our way to the Broadway.
then we ended up in Cleveland slinging hash at Ralph's Bait Shop and Waffle House.
then Ralph had an affair with Vinny.
I had a set of mixed-race twins.
and those were the good times.
April... I think your struggle is really moving.
and I want to help you get back on your feet.
I happen to know that you're only three credits shy of your diploma.
I can put you in my Spanish class.
and...
I know you're an amazing singer.
I want you to be in the glee club.
we'll get you sobered up...
find you some underwear.
it's not too late for you, April.
what do you say?
introduce you to someone very special.
this is April Rhodes.
she's our newest member.
wait, so old people can join Glee Club now?
old, huh?
you guys look like the world's worst Benetton ad.
Mr. Schuester, this seems like a terrible idea.
april is a great singer.
and she never graduated.
we appreciate what you're trying to do, but she's no Rachel.
who's Rachel?
Sh-She's kind of our star.
your star, eh?
well, where is she? - She left.
to be the lead in Cabaret.
Hey, Tinkles, give me "Maybe This Time" in B flat.
and don't let me catch you snoozing.
april.
I guess I better pour myself another Crantini.
I'm just kidding. It's hot chocolate.
all right, remember, guys, oral reports Wednesday.
april, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm sorry, Will.
the old noodle just ain't what she used to be.
I huffed a lot of upholstery cleaner in the '90s.
look, April,
I've been, uh, talking to the glee kids, and, um, I think they're still not so sure about having you around.
you draw a lot of attention to yourself.
and they're embarrassed enough as it is.
so do you think you could maybe take some time and try to win them over?
Yeah.
mm, smells like my Aunt Mildred.
just drink it.
with a bit of an after-burny taste.
Oh, good Chablis should always have a little bite.
now, a few swigs of that every day before school, and you'll have all the courage you need to be yourself.
Really? - Oh, yeah.
that's fantastic.
mm, so is my primo collection of vintage muscle magazines.
want them?
Mr. Schuester, I changed my mind.
april should stay.
I worship her.
I c-can't do this.
I don't understand why we're doing this in the first place.
your lack of imagination astounds me.
this is only the beginning.
if you can master this, you can sneak anything out of a store between your knees.
shoes, prom dresses.
I once got a cake out of a kid's birthday party.
with the candles still lit.
are you sure?
she can stay.
t- T-Totally.
this is terrible.
come hear the music play - This is a disaster - Life is a cabaret - I'm gonna barf.
old chum - Boring - Come to the cabaret - No, no, no, no, no!
I don't know what you want.
well, I know what I don't want.
and it is all of this.
when I gave you this part, I thought you could handle it, but clearly you can't.
what this show needs is a star with a little bit more maturity.
I know what you're trying to do.
you're trying to get me to quit, so you can be the star.
well, it won't work.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll say.
I'm sleeping with him. - So am I.
this play's weird.
that's Mr. Ryerson's favorite line.
you're a really good actor, Finn.
maybe you should consider joining the musical.
I'm pretty devoted to Glee.
I don't think I could just walk away from it.
I know how hard it was for you.
but I could justify doing both if you came back.
but we both know that's not gonna happen.
do you know what we should do?
elope?
what? - Nothing.
we should go bowling.
you're always so stressed out about the play.
you just need to loosen up.
I always go bowling whenever I'm worked up about a big game or something.
just us?
Yeah.
Yeah, that-that-that would be great.
I - I am really stressed out.
but that's the price you pay for being a star.
don't I know it.
april Rhodes, Rachel Berry.
Hey, can you give us the room, Rachel?
we need to teach April the cues for "Don't Stop Believing."
wait, she's singing the female lead?
wait, she's in the glee club?
she's... ancient.
talent doesn't age, sweetheart.
that's Rachel's part, Mr. Shue.
well, Rachel's not in the glee club anymore.
Thanks, Finn.
we're all really excited to see the play.
make sure you save us a seat in the front row.
Kurt, I'm a girl who knows her solvents, and your breath smells like rubbing alcohol.
Oh, Bambi.
I cried so hard when those hunters shot your mommy.
Hey, Em. Just trying to figure out the set list for Saturday.
I just got back from the emergency room.
had them give me four decontamination showers.
I think they call that "the full Silkwood."
what happened?
Kurt was drunk and he ralphed on me.
not really fessing up to how he got the booze just yet, but I'm pretty sure it's not a fake ID, because he looks like an 11-year-old milkmaid.
will, I think it was April.
her backpack's always clinking with empties.
I'm so sorry.
I - I will, I'll talk to him.
okay.
I'm, um,
I'm a little bit worried about the glee club.
so am I. I mean...
if we don't place at regionals, it-it's all over.
we have obligations as teachers, Will, to give kids opportunities for growth and enrichment.
with April in Glee, you're taking away a kid's chance to grow, and you're giving it to someone whose brain is soaked in corn booze.
april's not finished, Emma.
and if Glee's gonna win, I need to give her a second chance.
she is a talented performer and I really think that the kids are going to learn a lot of valuable technique from her.
okay.
but I think you need to think about...
why you're doing this and what you're willing to sacrifice to get it.
you...
suck!
rough day at the office, cookie?
I've just got a lot on my plate.
it's not easy being in the spotlight.
it's the difficult road I've chosen.
I know that song, sister.
um, do you have any NyQuil?
I could use a little pick-me-up.
these high school boys are a lot hotter than they used to be.
that Finn Hudson is one cutie pie I gots my eye on.
Finn's taken, April.
Yeah, well, some guys like a little somethin' - somethin' on the side.
I think your behavior is totally inappropriate and your presence in this school is a complete travesty.
what you choose to do with your life is your own business, but don't go around screwing up everyone else's.
I'm not afraid of you, sweetie.
there was a time when I was the biggest star around here.
and now that I've got that back...
I'm never letting it go.
do I have to put my fingers in the holes?
couldn't there be diseases in there or something?
Oh, no. Ball sharing's all part of the fun.
here, use the pink one.
pink's your favorite color, right?
now what?
follow my lead.
just look at the pins.
nice and straight.
you sure this is your first time?
you see what you can accomplish when you're sober?
sober? I'm rolling on a fistful of horse tranquilizers.
I can't feel my lips.
I think I'm going to keep these shoes.
I brought you here because I need to talk to you.
okay.
I'm concerned that you're a bad influence on the glee club.
I can't have you around if you're going to continue to encourage them to make bad choices.
you're right, Will.
as of right now, I'm back on the wagon.
Really?
that's great.
I have to tell you something.
I was in awe of you in high school.
I mean, of all the roads I never traveled in my life, the one I regret the most was never...
getting the chance to sing with you.
Really?
Yeah. I mean, that's how you get better, you know?
singing with people who are better than you.
you really thought that much of me?
you are the reason I joined Glee Club.
no...
so, your dream was always to sing with me, huh?
Yeah.
well, then, come on.
what? - Come on!
Hey, April, karaoke's on Wednesdays...
tonight's bingo.
shut your gravy hole, Barry.
Hey, guys, uh, happy gambling.
here we go.
this is really good pizza.
Yeah. I think they import the pepperoni from, like, Michigan or something.
how's Glee?
Oh, well, everybody misses you.
they miss my talent.
no, no. We're your friends.
we just miss having you around.
I love Glee, I just...
don't see the point in wasting my energies on someplace that I'm not appreciated.
I appreciate you.
it's your last ball.
just like the first time, but better.
come back to Glee.
what about Quinn?
I don't know what's going to happen in the future.
I just know that I want to spend more time with you now.
I'll-I'll have to quit the play.
I'll do it!
maybe Quinn is... There's a lactose intolerant.
that doesn't explain all the crying.
maybe she just doesn't like the group.
are you all that stupid?
Seriously?
I bet you thought Bert and Ernie were just roommates.
maybe Quinn's got one in the oven.
who's the baby's daddy?
who do you think?
Yes, you've heard right... I am returning to Glee Club.
in lieu of flowers, please send all donations to a socially conscious charity of your choice.
this is a hot damn mess.
Oh, my God.
uh, I'm sorry; I thought I'd be welcomed back with a tad more enthusiasm.
sorry, Glee Club has just been rocked with its first scandal.
Quinn's knocked up.
and the baby daddy?
I just wanted to drop off the application for that scholarship you were telling me about.
I got Rachel to come back to Glee, so, I figure we have a real shot at it.
I'm so proud of you.
see what you can accomplish when you set your mind to it?
you're a liar.
why didn't you tell me Quinn was pregnant?
who told you? - Everyone knows but me.
I'm the only fool who went out with you and let you kiss me, thinking you actually had feelings for me.
but I-I do.
look, yeah, I haven't been totally honest with you, but that's different than lying.
well, maybe it's not that much different, but...
but look, I need to get a music scholarship, so I can go to college, so I can get a good job, so I can take care of my kid and I can't do that if you don't come back to Glee Club.
you should take it as a compliment.
you could have just been honest with me.
look, I know what I did was wrong.
I get that, but... that kiss was real.
whatever it was, it ruined any chance of me ever coming back to Glee.
I hope you have fun playing house with Quinn while you languish in your little ensemble, but my dreams are bigger than that and they're bigger than you.
miss Sylvester.
we need to talk.
if you'd like to to return to the musical, changes need to be made.
well, Rachel, I couldn't agree with you more.
you know, when I heard Sandy wanted to write himself into a scene as Queen Cleopatra,
I was aroused, then furious.
I hereby grant you complete artistic control.
congratulations, kiddo.
you now have everything you could possibly want.
isn't it a great feeling?
the house is packed... you guys are going to kick butt tonight.
your first performance in front of a real audience.
I can't wait. You guys are going to love it.
Where-Where's April?- Yee-haw!
right on cue, as usual.
Hey, roller-boy. Handsome.
Oh, I like that color.
have you been working on the, uh, moves we talked...
you've got something right there, on your...
there's my boy. - Are you drunk?
you promised me you'd sober up for this.
when? Last night?
well, I was drunk. You can't hold me to that.
hit it, knuckles.
april Rhodes almost ran me over in the parking lot just now, Will.
you can't let her go on in her condition.
there is an auditorium full of people waiting to see us perform and if she doesn't go on, none of the kids can.
Wow. It's really great how committed you are to these kids.
now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome McKinley High School's New Directions.
I need to talk to you.
sorry. Baby had to tinkle.
come on. Act two. - No, I can't let you go back out there.
you broke a promise.
you're right.
it's a great moment for me, but it didn't feel right.
I don't belong up there.
but everybody deserves their moment in the spotlight, you know, to shine?
Oh, I got that standing ovation, Will.
and it felt amazing.
like every bad decision I'd ever made just went away.
I was back in the game.
but then I look over and I see these sweet faces of these kids and I think...
I'm hogging their sunshine.
it's their turn now, not yours.
they're so lucky to have you, Will, because you won't let what happened to me ever happen to any of them.
so, where you gonna go?
I'm going to straighten up.
maybe try to find a new dream.
you know, I always loved the Broadway.
the Broadway?
do you think there's a part out there for a washed-up has-been like me?
april, you are not washed-up.
and hey, there's always Branson.
thank you.
no, no, no.
thank you.
Branson, eh?
they loved us! We're a hit.
Wh-Wh-Where's April?
you were right, Mr. Shue.
she'd massacre Mariah in a diva-off.
april is amazing.
but she's not in the glee club anymore.
it...
I, uh...
I screwed up bringing her here.
it was about me and Glee Club is supposed to be about you guys.
you don't need her to be great.
but we need her for the second act.
I'll just have to go out there and tell them we had to cut the show short.
Hey, guys.
you were great.
don't worry.
there will be other performances.
excuse me?
I think I might have a solution.
in show business, when a star can't perform, her understudy steps in.
I'd be happy to go in for April, if you'd let me.
since when are you willing to be an understudy?
since I quit the play.
Really? Why?
I realized being a star didn't make me feel as special as being your friend.
if I'd let you down when you needed me the most,
I'd never forgive myself.
I know all the words to the song.
you don't know the choreography.
then we're going to have to give her a lot of help out there.
go get in your costume.
well, I mean, is anything autobiographical?
we all see the world through our own tiny keyhole, right?
I mean, I always think of Thomas Wolfe, you know, if you ever seen that little one page note to reader in the front of "Look Homeward, Angel," you know what I'm talking about?
anyway, he says that we are the sum of all the moments of our lives, and that anybody who sits down to write is gonna use the clay of their own mind, that you can't avoid that.
so when I look at my own life, you know, I have to admit, right...that I've...
I've never been around a bunch of guns, or violence.
you know, not really.
no political intrigue or... helicopter crash, right?
but my life, from my own point of view, has been full of drama, right?
and, so, I thought that if I could write a book that...
...that could capture what it's like to really meet somebody.
I mean the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me is to really meet somebody, make that connection, and if I could...
..make that valuable, you know, to capture that, that would be the attempt or...
did I answer your question?
I'll try to be more specific...
were there ever a French young woman on the train you met, and... spent an evening with?
see, to me, that...
that's not important, you know?
so that's a "yes."
all right, since I'm in France and this is last stop in my book tour, "yes."
Mr. Wallace, the book ends on an ambiguous note.
we don't know!
do you think they get back together in six months, like they promise each other?
like they promised, uh...
I think I answered that. You know, it's...
it's a good test.
right? If you're a romantic or a cynic.
I mean, you think... you think they get back together, you don't, for sure, so you're asking the question.
and... do you think they get back together?
I mean, did you, in real life?
did I real...
look, see, in the words of my grandfather, ok...
to answer that, would take the piss out of the whole thing.
Oh, no...
we just have the time for one last question.
what is your next book?
I don't know, man, I don't know...
I've been...
I've been thinking about this...
well, I always kind of wanted to write a book that all took place within the space of a pop song, you know, like 3 or 4 minutes long.
the story, the idea is that...
there's this guy.
and...
he's totally depressed!
I mean, his great dream was to be a lover, an adventurer, you know, riding motorcycles through South America, and instead he's sitting at a marble table, eating lobster, and he's got a good job and a beautiful wife, right.
you know, everything that he needs.
but that doesn't matter, 'cause what he wants is to fight for meaning.
you know, happiness is in the doing, not in the...
getting what you want.
so, he's sitting there, and just at a second, his little five year old daughter hops up on the table.
and he knows that she should get down 'cause she could get hurt, but she's dancing to this pop song, in a summer dress.
and he looks down, and all of a sudden, he is sixteen.
and... his high school sweetheart is dropping him off, at home.
and they've just lost their virginity, and she loves him, and the same song is playing on the car radio, and she climbs up and starts dancing on the roof of the car.
and now, now he's worried about her!
and she is beautiful, with a...
a facial expression just like his daughters'.
in fact, you know, maybe that's why he even likes her.
you see, he knows he's not remembering this dance, he's there.
he's there in both moments simultaneously.
and just like for an instance, all his life is just folding into itself and it's obvious to him that time is a lie...
that's it's all happening all the time and inside every moment is another moment, all...
you know, happening simultaneously.
and, anyway, that's kind of the idea... Anyway.
well, our author has to be going to the airport soon, so he'll thank you all very much for coming here this afternoon.
and a special thanks to Mr. Wallace for being with us.
we hope to see you again here on your next book!
Merci a toutes et a tous qu'etre venus.
comme vous voyez y a du champagne, y a des petites choses, donc servez vous.
thank you all.
how much longer before I have to go to the airport?
Oh, you should leave at 7: 30.
7: 30 at the very latest!
OK.
Hi.
hello.
how are you?
good, and you?
I'm good, yeah, I'm great, I'm...
do you want...
maybe get a cup of coffee?
didn't you just say you have a plane to catch?
uh, yeah...
but, I mean, I have a little time.
okay.
I'll meat you outside, okay.
I'm just gonna go out, get a cup of coffee,
Yeah, I sure did.
well, get your driver Philippe's card so that you can call on the cell phone if you're running late.
and we will put your bags in the car so you are not late going to the airport.
thanks for everything. Merci beaucoup.
which one's Philippe?
philippe, passe lui ta carte pour qu'il le forme numero portable.
Merci.
I can't believe you're here!
well, I live here in Paris.
are you sure you don't have to stay, you're not suppose to talk some more?
no, no, no, they sicken me,
I spent the night here last night.
Oh, you did?
Yeah, yeah, they've got a waft upstairs...
anyway, how are you? This is so weird.
I'm fine, it's...
it's good to see you!
it's good to see you.
so you wanna go to a cafe?
uh, yeah...
okay, there's one a little further, that I like.
I thought I was gonna totally loose it in there.
when I first saw you...
I mean, how did you even know I was going to be here?
well, it's my favorite bookstore in Paris. I...
you can sit down for hours and read...
I love it.
there's flees, but, you know...
I know, I think a cat slept at my head last night.
so, I saw your picture on the calendar about a month ago, and that you were going to be here.
it's funny because I read an article on your book, it sounded vaguely familiar...
vaguely, yeah...
Yes.
but I didn't put it all together until I saw your photo, so...
did you have a chance to read it?
Yes, I...
I was really, really surprised as you can imagine, I mean...
I had to read it twice, actually.
yeah?
Yeah.
comme Si, Comme Ca?
no, I liked it!
it's very romantic, and I usually don't like that...
but it's, it's really well written.
it's really well written, no, I really... Congratulations!
wait!
before we go any anywhere, I have a...
I have to ask you...
sure, what?
did you show up in Vienna, that December?
uh, did you?
no, I couldn't, but...
did you? I need to know, it's important to me!
why, if you didn't?
well, did you?
no.
Oh, thank God you didn't!
well, thank God you...
I mean, thank God I didn't, and you didn't!
I mean, one of us had shown alone...
and that would have sucked.
I know, I know, I was so concerned with that.
I always felt horrible about not being there, but I couldn't!
you know, my grandma died a few days before, and she was buried that day.
december 16th, that day!
she died, the one in Budapest?
Yes, you remember that?
Yeah, I remember everything.
of course, it wasn't in your book.
but anyway, I was about to fly to Vienna, you know,
and I... and we heard the news about her, and of course I took her to the funeral with my parents.
well, I'm sorry to hear that.
I know.
you weren't there anyway...
Why?
why weren't you there?
I would have been there if I could have,
I made plans, and we...
you better have a good reason!
what?
Oh, no!
no, you were there, weren't you?
Oh, no, that's terrible!
I know I'm laughing, but I don't mean it!
did you hate me? You must stop hating me.
have you been hating me all this time?
you have!
no, no... - Yes, you have!
Oh, but you can't hate me now, right?
I mean, my grandma... - I don't hate you, all right?
come on, it's no big deal, all right?
I flew all the way over there, you blew the thing off, and then my life has been a big nose dive since then, but it's not a problem.
no, you can't say that! No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding...
Oh, I can't believe it, you must have been so angry with me...
I'm so sorry, I really wanted to be there, more than anything in the world! I swear...
honestly, I swear...
I mean, you can't be angry... my grandmother...
no, I know, I know,
I honestly thought that something like that might have happened.
I was definitely bumped, but...
mostly, I was jut mad we hadn't exchanged any phone numbers or any information.
I know, that was so stupid, no way to get in touch.
I didn't even know your last name - I know, I know...
I mean we were both afraid that if we started writing and calling, that it would slowly...
you know, fade out.
Yeah, it definitely wasn't a slow fade. - No, it sure wasn't.
I know, we wanted to pick it up were we left off.
which would have been fun if it worked... - Yes, a good idea...
ahh, so...
how long were you in Vienna, then?
just a couple of days.
did you meet another girl?
Aah, yeah. Her name was Gretchen, and she was amazing.
you did? Yeah, the book is really a composite of the two of you.
Really? Oh, no... No, I'm kidding!
you wouldn't believe it, I even went back to the train station.
I put up, you know, signs of my number, and the hotel, in case you've been delayed. I was a total dork.
let's go this way. Did you get any calls?
just a couple hookers, looking for a gig.
no, it was awful. What do you want me to say...
Oh, it's so sad. I'm so sorry!
I walked around for a couple of days. Eventually, I flew home,
I owed my dad 2000 bucks, who had warned me about French chicks, I have to say.
what did he tell you about French women?
nothing, the guy... he's never met any French women.
he's never been east of the Mississippi.
so why didn't you put "Six months later, the French bitch didn't have show up.
you know, like... But I did, I did.
you did? - Yeah, no, I mean I made it more hopeful.
I wrote this whole fictional version in which you actually do show up.
Oh, what happens? - Uhm...
what?
uhm, we make love for about ten days straight, that's one part of it.
Oh, that's interesting. So, the French slut...
yeah - Ok, ok...
it's just, then they, you know, they start to know each other better and they realize that they don't get along at all.
I like that. It's more real.
Yeah, well, my editor didn't think that way.
no, everyone wants to believe in love. It sells, right?
Yeah, exactly...
so things are going well for you, right?
I mean, your book is a best seller in the US..
it's a tiny best-seller. - Oh, come on...
all right, yeah, officially, yes, but I mean all those people haven't read Moby Dick, you know, so why should they read my book?
I haven't read Moby Dick, and I liked your book, so...
nice.
you know, I thought you idealized the night a bit.
Oh, come on, it's officially fiction...
I mean, I'm supposed to... - No, no, I know, I know.
I know, I thought...
you know, there were times when you made me a...
huh, I mean her, right?
no, me... Ok, whatever!
Ah... a little bit neurotic!
you are a little bit like that, aren't you?
you think I'm neurotic? - No, no, no, come on, I'm kidding!
where did I do that? I didn't do that.
maybe it's just me you know...
reading something knowing that the character in the story is based on you...
it's both flattering and disturbing at the same time.
how is it disturbing?
I don't know, just... being part of someone else's memory.
seeing myself through your eyes.
how long did it take you to write it?
uhm, 3 or 4 years, on and off.
wow, that's a really long time to be writing about one night!
Yeah, I know, tell me about it.
I always assumed you had forgotten me.
no, I had a pretty clear picture of you in my mind.
I have to tell you something.
I just... - What?
I wanted to talk to you for so long, you know, now that...
Yeah, me too.- ...it's just so real, you know,
I feel I can't get anything out of my mouth.
I know, I know, how long do we have? 20 minutes and 30 seconds?
let's go! No, we got more than that.
I wanna know about you.
tell what are you doing... you know, what are you up to?
uhm, where to start... I work for Green Cross.
it's an environmental organization. - What are they all about?
well, we basically work on different environment issues, from clean water to disarmament of chemical weapons.
you know, international laws that deal with the environment.
and, and, what do you do for them? We're going this way.
uhm, different things.
like last year, I was in India for quite a while, working on a water treatment plant.
Wow! - Well, yeah, the cotton industry there is a major source of pollution, so...
I mean, this sounds like you're actually doing something, you know,
I mean, most people, myself included, just...
sit around and bitch, you know,
america's consuming all the world resources, SUVs suck, global warming is real...
you know, I'm really relieved you're not one of those
freedom Fries kind of Americans.
Hey, you know... But, how did you get into that?
Ah, I came out of political science and I was hoping to work for the government.
and I did, for a while... eh, terrible!
not good? - Yeah, no.
anyway, I got really tired... let's go this way ... of having those endless conversations with friends about how the world is falling to pieces.
so I decided what I really wanted to do was to find things that could be fixed, and try to fix them, you know?
I always thought you'd be doing something cool like that.
I did! - Thanks!
I just... no, really, really like you to be doing a job that I like.
you know, I actually alternated between thinking that...
you know, everything is irrevocably screwed up, and that things might be getting better in some ways.
better? How could you possibly say that?
well, I just mean, you know... I mean, I know it sounds weird, but there are things to be optimistic about.
okay... I know the book you're selling, which is great, I'm very happy for you, but...
let me break the news for you, ok?
the world is a mess right now! - I wasn't saying that...
OK, we're moving all our industry to developing nations.
we can get cheap labor free of any environmental laws.
OK, the weapon industry is booming,
five million people die every year for preventable water disease.
so, how is the world getting any better?
I'm not getting angry, I'm not getting angry, but...
come on, I want to know, I'm interested!
OK, I realize that there are a lot of serious problems in the world.
OK, thank you! - I mean, I don't even have one publisher in the whole Asian market.
OK, all right. Say "stop it"!
what, what? "Stop."
no, look, all I'm saying is that there's more awareness out there, right?
people are going to fight back!
you know, I mean I think the world might be getting better because people like you are educated into speaking out.
even the very notion of conservation, environmental issues, those weren't even in the vocabulary until fairly recently, and now they're becoming a norm, and eventually might be what's expected all over the world!
I agree with what you're saying, but at the same time, it's dangerous!
an imperialist country can use that kind of thinking to justify the economy greed. You know, human rights...
a particular imperialistic country you have in mind there, Frenchy?
no, not really Bon soir!
bon soir.
so, you want to sit over there?
Yeah, this is perfect.
Oh, wow, maybe what I'm saying is the world might be evolving the way a person evolves.
right, I mean... me, for example am I getting worse?
am I improving? I don't know!
when I was younger...
I was healthier, but I was racked with insecurity.
now I'm older, my problems are deeper, but I'm... more equipped to handle them.
so, what are your problems?
right now? I don't have any.
I don't. Just...
...damn happy to be here!
me too.
so, how long have you been in Paris?
I got in last night. I've done 10 cities in 12 days,
I'm a wreck... I'm so glad it's over.
I'm tired of being a hugster.
Ques-ce que je vous serve?
what do you want?
a cup of coffee...
un cafe et un citrone, s'il vous plait.
God, I love this cafe. I wish they had places like this in the US.
Yeah, I missed cafes when I was living over there.
I mean, I find a few places I really liked, but there was...
you... You were living in the US?
Yes, from... '96 to '99.
I was studying at NYU.
Oh, God, don't tell me that, Celine!
what? - No, it's just...
nothing, I mean I... - What?
I've been living in New York since '98.
you know, we were there at the same time!
in New York? - Yeah...
Oh, that's weird...
it actually crossed my mind a few times that I might run into you, but...
the odds are so slim, right? So...
I didn't even know what city you were living in.
weren't you somewhere in Texas?
you were in Texas... - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
definitely, I just... I was for a long time, I just...
you know, wanted to try New York.
what brought you back here?
I had finished my masters, for one. And... no visa. No more visa.
and, anyway, I was starting to get paranoid.
all... the violence in the medias. Gang violence, murders...
especially serial killers.
but, the final stroll was: One night I heard a...
some noise on my fire escape, so I called 911.
and the cops came, eventually. - Yeah, like 3 hours later.
Yeah, after I had been raped and killed about 30 times.
no, but... It was a man and a woman officer, and I was explaining to them what I had heard, when the woman had to run downstairs to move the police car.
so, I was left alone with the male cop.
and right away, he asked me if I had a gun...
and I said no, of course not, I...
and he told me: "You better think about getting one.
this is America, not France." Okay?
and I said to him, you know, I have no idea how to shoot a gun, and, I have no interest in firearms, whatsoever.
and that's when he pulled out his gun, like this...
and he went:
on one day... you're gonna have something like this in your face, and if you wanna have a long life, you're gonna have to choose...
between you... alone.
and they left... And the next morning I called for an application to get a gun.
me, with a gun! I mean, that's really scary...
but then I realized something was wrong, the way that cop had pulled out his gun out, and everything...
so I canceled my demand for the gun, and...
and I called the police station, and tried to complain about that cop's behavior, but...
what happened with that? - It was so much paperwork...
and then I got scared, with my shity student desire.
Yeah, you thought you'd get deported. - Yeah, exactly!
so I gave up and I forgot about the whole thing.
well, I guess I never forgotten. - Obviously... yeah.
but, still, you know... I really enjoyed being there.
there's a lot of things I miss about the US.
Yeah, like what?
well...
the overall good mood people have there,
like, you know, even if it can be bullshit sometimes.
like "How you doin'?" "Great!" "How you doing?" "Great!
have a perfect day!
I don't know...
Parisians can be so grumpy, have you noticed?
no, everybody seems pretty happy to me.
they're not happy... - They're not happy.
no, they are, I don't know. Maybe I just meet French men...
they drive me nuts!
what is it? What about them?
well, they're very nice. They're great, you know, to be around, they love food, wine. They're great cooks...
but, I don't know, maybe I've had really bad luck with them.
Why? What do you mean?
uhm, well...
I guess they're not as ... - What?
what's the word?
uhm...
horny?
they're not as horny... - Horny?
all right, well, listen to me on this one,
in that regard, I'm proud to be an American.
and you should be, in that regard only.
Merci.
have you ever spent some time in Eastern Europe?
eastern? No, no...
no?
I remember as a teenager I went to Warsaw, when it was still a strict communist regime.
which I don't approve of at all.
sure you don't...
no, I do... -No, I'm just kidding!
but, anyway, something about being there was very interesting, I found.
after a couple of weeks, something changed in me.
the city was quite gloomy and gray...
but, after a while, my brain seemed clearer.
I was writing a lot more in my journal, ideas I never thought of before.
communist ideas?
listen, I'm not... - I'm sorry, I can't...
go on!
I'll send you to a Gulag!
no... But, it took me a while to figure out why it felt, you know, so different.
and then, one day, as I was walking through the Jewish cemetery,
I don't know why, but it occurred to me there,
I realized that I had spent the last 2 weeks away from most of my habits.
TV was in a language I didn't understand,
so, all I've been doing was...
walk around, thinking right!
my brain felt like it was at rest, free from the consuming frenzy.
and I have to say, it was almost like a natural high.
I felt so peaceful inside, no... strange urge to be somewhere else, to shop...
maybe it could have seemed like boredom at first, but it quickly became very, very sore full.
it's interesting, you know?
can you believe that it was 9 years ago that we were walking around Vienna?
nine years? No that's impossible...
it was, it feels like two months ago to me, but it was summer '94.
do I look any different?
I do?
I'd have to see you naked.
what? - I'm sorry...
your hair was different back then, it was like...
what, it's the same... - Take it down, let's see!
down, it was down. - Yeah.
OK.
well, voila!
so?
OK, come on, tell me.
skinnier, I think, more thinner.
did you think I was fat before?
no.
Yeah, you thought I was a fatty. No, you thought I was a fatty...
you wrote a book about a fat French girl!
Oh, no. - Seriously, all right, you look beautiful.
do I look any different?
no.
no, no real... oh, actually, you have this line.
I know. - Looks like a scar.
a scar? What, a gun shot wound?
no, no, no, I lied to you, I'm sorry.
I had this funny... well, horrible dream the other day.
I was having this awful nightmare, that I was 32, and then I woke up, and I was 23!
so relieved...
and then I woke up for real, and I was 32.
scary! - It happens.
Yeah, time goes faster and faster.
apparently, it's because we don't renew our synapses live to 20.
so, it's pretty much downhill from then on.
I like getting older, you know, it feels...
I don't know, it feels more immediate.
you know, like I can appreciate things more.
no, me too, actually. I really love it.
I was once a...
...a drummer in a band.
you were?
Yeah, we were pretty good, actually.
but the lead singer guy, he was just so obsessed with us getting a record deal.
you know, it's all we talked about, it was all we thought about, getting bigger shows, and everything was just... focus on the future, all the time!
and now, the...
... band doesn't even exist anymore.
right, I'm looking back at the... at the shows we did play, even rehearsing, ... it was so much fun!
now I'd be able to enjoy every minute of it.
can I have a trier?
well, your book has been published, that's...
that's pretty big deal, and you've been all around Europe with it.
are you enjoying every minute of it?
not really... - Not really?
do you have another one of those?
Yes, of course.
here.
in my field, I see these people... oh, sorry... coming to it with big idealist visions of becoming the new leader that will create a better world.
they enjoy the goal, but not the process!
right.
but the reality of it is that the true work of improving things is in the little achievements of the day.
and that's what you need to enjoy, just take my field.
what, what do you mean, exactly?
well, for example, I was working for this organization that helped villages in Mexico.
and their concerns was how to get the pencils sent to the kid in these little country schools.
I was not about big revolutionary ideas, it was about pencils!
I see the people that do the real work and what's really said, in a way, is that...
the people that are the most giving, hard working and capable of making this world better, usually don't have the ego and ambition to be a leader.
they don't see the interest in superficial rewards, they don't care if their name ever appear in the press, they actually enjoy the process of helping others, they're in the moment!
Yeah, but that's so hard!
you know, to be in the moment, and I just feel like I'm...
designed to be slightly dissatisfied with everything...
you know, I mean, like... always trying to better my situation.
you know, I satisfy one desire, and it just...
agitates another, you know?
then I think: to hell with everything, right?
I mean, desire is the fuel of life
I mean, do you think it's true that if...
if we never wanted anything, we'd never be unhappy?
I don't know...
not wanting anything, isn't that...
a symptom of depression?
Yeah, that is, right?
I mean, it's healthy to desire, right?
yeah...
I don't know,
I mean, it's what all those Buddhist guys say, right?
you know, liberate yourself from desire and you'll find that you already have everything you need.
Yeah, but I feel really alive when I want something more than just basic survival needs.
I mean, wanting whether it's... intimacy with another person, or a new pair of shoes, is kind of beautiful...
I like that we have those ever-renewing desires.
well, maybe it's just a sense of entitlement.
you know, like whenever you feel like you deserve that new pair of shoes, you know.
it's ok to want things as long as you don't get pissed off if you don't get them.
Yeah. - Right, life's hard.
it's suppose to be.
if we didn't suffer, we wouldn't learn a thing, you know?
so, what? Are you a Buddhist or something?
no.
no? Why not?
I don't know, I...
same reason I don't consider myself anything, really.
Yeah, I know. I decided a long time ago that
I was gonna to be open to everything, but, not buy into any one-and-only belief system.
I went to this...
trapist monastery, a couple of years ago.
Trapist?
Yeah, they're Catholics, Cistercians.
why did you do that?
Why? I had just been doing some reading, I guess...
I don't know, I thought it'd be cool.
have you ever spent any time with any monks and nuns?
no...
it's not really my style.
I expected them to be all glowering and stern, but they weren't...
they were really quick to laugh, really easy to be around.
seriously, very attuned to everything.
they were just...
you know, they weren't trying to hustle anybody.
they're trying to live and die, in peace with God, you know, or whatever part of them they feel is eternal.
it was just so refreshing to be around.
you know, you realize that most of the people that you meet are trying to get somewhere better, you know, they're trying to make a little bit more cash, trying to get a little more respect, have more people admire them, you know,
it's just exhausting!
you know, it's exhausting to be one of those people yourself.
I mean, there I... there I am, right, you know, all greedy to be more spiritual, you know, I wanna be a better person.
you can't escape!
I had this...
this boyfriend of mine, many years ago, that wanted to be a Buddhist, and...
so he went to Asia to visit some of this monasteries.
Yeah, I thought about doing that, too.
Yeah, you should. I'll tell you why.
aaa, he was quite good looking, and, each time he went to one of those monasteries, a monk offered to suck his cock.
true story...
well, then, it all comes down to that, doesn't it?
I mean, I think that's why I really admire what you're doing.
what do you mean, sucking cock?
Ah, no...
I was gonna say...
you know, you're not detached... from life.
you know, you're putting your passion into action.
well...
I try.
you know something,
I'm...
I'm gonna be on planes, and like, an airport for the next 8 hours.
I'd just love to...
to see a little bit more of Paris.
could we walk, right... - Yeah, yeah, let's do that!
do you mind? - No, no, no, that's great!
do you want to? - Yeah, yeah, that's great!
what do we owe here?
4, 50...
no, no, I got it, I got it.
is this good for like a two?
Yeah, that's fine! That's more.
all right, is anywhere to go around here?
it's sales day, today!
what's that?
it's when everything is on sale in Paris.
it's twice a year.
au revoir!
au revoir, merci!
all right, let's go shopping!
no, no, no, that's a bad idea. I don't want to inflict that on you.
it's madness...
let's just go to this garden path.
all right.
it's really nice...
all right, that sounds better than shopping, actually...
I mean, not that I wouldn't do whatever you wanted.
you know, sometimes I don't even need to buy anything. I just...
get high on trying on and looking at things.
Yeah, well a therapist would tell you... Is this where we're going?
Yeah! - A therapist would tell you it's all good.
Really? - Yeah.
are you ever in therapy? - Oh, no!
do I seem like I'm in therapy?
I'm kidding...
has it helped your sex problems?
my sex problems?
no, I'm kidding... - Like what? Tell me the truth.
we didn't have any problems that night.
no, I'm kidding!
we didn't even have sex, anyway.
but, that's a joke, right?
no, we didn't!
I mean, that was the whole thing.
no, of course we did!
no, no, no, we didn't.
you didn't have a condom, and I never have sex without one.
especially on a one night thing.
I mean, I'm extremely paranoid about my health.
there's no way I would have... - Whoa, I find this very scary that you don't remember what happened.
no, listen, ok...
I didn't write an entire book, but I kept a journal, ok?
and I wrote the whole night in it.
that's what I mean, you idealizing the night!
all right, listen!
I even remember what brand of condom we used.
okay, that's disgusting. I don't want to hear it!
it's not disgusting...
OK, you know what, when I get home,
I'll check my journal from '94, but I know I'm right!
wait a minute... - What?
was it in a cemetery?
no...
no, we went to the cemetery in the afternoon, it was in a park.
very late at night.
in the park!
wait a minute...
okay...
is it that forgettable?
I mean, you really don't remember... in the park!
okay, wait a minute.
I...
I think you might be right...
all right now, you're messing with me, now.
are you messing with me?
OK, no, I'm sorry!
I think you... I mean, you're right, okay?
sometimes, I put things in drawers inside my head, and forget about it.
I guess it's less painful to put certain things away than to live with it!
I'm sorry! - It's like that...
... that night was a sad memory for you?
no, I didn't mean that night in particular...
I just meant certain things are better off forgotten.
I remember that night better than I do entire years.
me too.
Really?
well, I thought I did...
but, maybe I...
maybe I put it away because of the fact that...
my grandmother's funeral was the day we were supposed to meet again.
it was a tough day for me, but must have been worse for you.
it was unreal.
I remember looking at a dead body in the coffin.
her beautiful hands so warm, so sweet, that used to hold me, that...
nothing in that coffin resembled what I remembered of her.
all the warmth was gone.
then I was crying...
so confused if I was crying because I was never gonna see her again,
I'd never gonna see...
... you again.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to go on like this,
I've been a little down this week, I don't know...
Why?
I don't know, nothing bad, just...
reading your book, maybe?
no, but...
thinking about how hopeful I was that summer and fall, and since then it's been kind of a...
I don't know.
memory is a wonderful thing, if you don't have to...
deal with the past.
memory is a wonderful thing, if you don't have to deal with the past.
can I put that on a bumper stick?
no, you know what? If you wrote a book about our life, that would be a good title!
Yeah, it could be a totally different book.
Yeah, there'd be no sex nights.
but you know what?
what?
now that we've met again, we can change our memory of that December 16th.
it no longer has that sad ending of us never seeing each other again.
right? - Right.
I guess a memory is never finished.
so long as you're alive...
Yeah, I know.
I have this memory from my childhood, that, I realized recently, never happened!
what?
well, when I was 8 or 9, my mom was so paranoid when I was walking home, from my piano lesson at night, she would always warn me about dirty old men, giving me candy, and then showing me their penis...
she was so obsessed with it, that...
later in life, you know, I had...
I had this image in my head that that's really happened!
to the point that I even associated sex with that walk home.
I mean, sometimes, even now, when I'm...
when I'm having sex, I see myself walking down that street.
I swear!
it's so weird, right?
well, is that street near by?
I mean, could...
no...
very far.
did you ever keep a journal when you were a kid?
uhm, yeah...
on and off, I guess.
it's funny, I read a...
one of mine from '83, the other day.
yeah
and, what really surprised me, was that
I was feeling with life, the same way am now.
I was much hopeful and naive, but the core, and the way I was feeling things, is exactly the same!
it made me realize I haven't changed much at all.
Yeah, I don't think anybody does, and people don't want to admit it, but it's like we just...
we have this innate set points.
Aha. - You know, it's like...
nothing much that happens to us changes our disposition.
really, you believe that?
I think so. I read this study where they followed people who won the lottery, and people who had become paraplegic, right.
you'd think that...
you know, one extreme is gonna make you...
euphoric, and the other suicidal.
but the study shows that after about 6 months, - Uhum - Right...
as soon as people got used to their new situation, they were more or less the same.
the same? - Well, yeah...
like if they were basically an optimistic, jovial person, they're now an optimistic, jovial person, in a wheel chair.
if they're a petty miserable asshole, ok, they're a petty miserable asshole with a new Cadillac, a house and a boat.
so, you now be forever depressed, no matter what great things happen in my life?
Definitely!
great! - No, come on...
are you depressed now?
no, no, I'm not depressed.
but, sometimes I worry that,
I'll get to the end of my life feeling I haven't done all I've all I wanted to do.
Oh, what do you wanna do?
Oh, I want to paint more, I wanna...
play my guitar everyday,
I wanna learn Chinese,
I wanna write more songs...
there're so many things I wanna do, and end up doing not much.
all right, well, let me ask you this:
do you believe in, like...
ghosts or spirits?
uhm, no.
no? - No.
OK, what about reincarnation?
not at all.
God?
no.
that sounds terrible.
no, no, no.
but, at the same time,
I don't wanna be one of those people that don't believe in any kind of magic.
so, then astrology.
Yes, of course! - There we go!
I mean, that makes sense, right?
you're a Scorpio, I'm a Sag, so we get along.
no, no.
there's an Einstein quote I really, really like.
he said: "If you don't believe in any kind of magic, or mystery, basically, as good as dead."
Yeah, I like that.
I've always felt there was some kind of mystical chord in the Universe.
more recently, I started to think that...
that me... you know, my personality, whatever, that...
I don't have any permanent place here.
you know, in Eternity, or whatever, you know.
and the more I think that, I can't go through life saying that this is no big deal, you know.
I mean, this is it!
this is actually happening.
what do you... think is interesting, what do you think is funny, what do you think is important?
you know, every day is our last!
when I feel that way, I...
usually call my mom to tell her how much I love her.
Yeah.
and she's always: "Are you ok?"
do you have cancer?
are you going to commit suicide?
it's almost not worth it.
so...
so, what about us?
what about us?
no, what I mean is, if we were both going to die, tonight...
what, like if the Apocalypse was coming?
no, no, that's too dramatic.
but, what if...
you know, just the two of us were going to die.
I mean, would we talk about your book, the environment or...
if today was our last day?
Yeah, what would we talk about, what would you tell me, for example?
well...
that's hard. - No, I'll do it, I'll do it.
I definitely...
would stop talking about my book.
I have to admit I would probably drop the environment.
but, I would still...
want to talk about, you know, magic and the Universe.
I'd just wanna do it from a...
what?
... a hotel room.
you know, in between sessions of us...
... wildly... fucking, until we die.
Wow!
well, why waste time with an hotel room?
why not do it right there... on the bench?
no... - Come here, come here...
OK
we're not gonna die tonight.
OK? - All right, too bad...
I'm sorry.
that was an extreme example.
I'm sorry. - Ok.
what I... My point was, you know, to truly communicate with people is very hard to do.
I know, I mean most of our... most of our day to day exchanges.
Yeah, I know, I mean...
not to bring everything back to sex
but, why not?
no, no, this example, this friend of mine, she...
she was talking about she and her boyfriend, problems at bed...
right...
... and how when, they had been dating for a year, she started telling him what he could do to please her more.
and it totally freaked him out!
Why? - Totally.
well, he felt all threatened and he thought he was a bad lover.
maybe she shouldn't have waited so long.
you know, after an year... - Well, yeah, but, men are so easily offended!
Oh, what, more than women, you think?
Oh, definitely on that subject! - You think so?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
well, maybe it's because, you know...
men are...
easier to...
you know, ... to please.
well, I don't know... - Yeah, they are, they definitely...
definitely.
anyway, this friend of mine, she was telling me that, next time she dates another man, she's gonna make a little questionnaire, about what they like and dislike, for the event...
like written down, or out loud?
Yeah, yeah, written down, mostly written down.
but it wouldn't be just...
you know, yes or no, it would be a little more complex than that.
like for example, if the question is:
are you into S and M?
the answer could be "No, but...
... a good spanking once in a while, doesn't hurt."
right? - Right. Or like:
do you like talking dirty in bed?
that kind of thing?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but not just like...
any dirty talk.
just like: "What specific word would you like to hear?"
you know, like... - What, me?
well, yeah.
like, for example, like what specific word would you like to hear?
I don't know...
uhm...
what do you feel about the word "Pussy"?
I... love it.
good.
it's amazing what...
perverts we've become in the past 9 years.
I know, I know.
well, at least now we don't have to pretend that each new sexual experience is like a life altering event.
I know, by now, you know you've stuck it in so many places, it's like, about to fall off.
I mean, you know, I can't realistically expect you to have become anything but a total hole, at this point.
Yeah, thank you.
no, I'm sor...
that's true, what can you do?
what can you do...
so...
what kind of songs do you write?
I didn't know you did that. - What kind?
Yeah, sure. - I don't know, just songs.
like some are, you know, people,
uhm, relationships... one's about my cat!
sing one!
just... - No, I can't, I don't have a guitar.
come on, acapella.
no, no, no, I'm not singing a song without a guitar, you're nuts!
why not?
it's...
Oh, ok, not now.
no.
if not now, when?
you want to meet here in six months, with a guitar?
you know, I'll fly all they way over here, you may or may not make the metro...
OK, that's... that's funny.
we've got to get going back to the bookstore!
you'll miss your flight. Come on, let's go!
all right, all right. - We can walk down La Sennes.
it's a nice thing.
so, you're flying back to New York?
Yeah, yeah.
so I read in that article that you're married, with a kid.
that's great!
Yeah, he's... he's...
he's 4.
UhUm, what's his name?
Henry.
little Hen, he's so much fun.
Oh, wow, I'm sure!
and, your wife, what does she do?
she teaches elementary school.
do you have kids?
Yes, two.
Hih, shit!
what? - I left them in the car!
with the windows up, it was 6 months ago...
no, I'm kidding...
no, but... I want to have kids someday, I'm just not ready, yet.
Yeah, I'm in a good relationship, though.
Oh, yeah? That's good. - Yeah.
what's he do?
he's a photo journalist, he does war coverage.
he's away a lot, which in a way is good for me, because I'm so busy...
Yeah, but isn't it dangerous?
I mean, aren't a lot of this guys getting killed this days?
he promises me he doesn't take risks.
but I often worry, he goes in this trance when he starts to photograph some things.
what do you mean?
well, once we were in New Delhi and we pass a bum, that was lying down the sidewalk, - A bump? - A bum!
a homeless...
a bum, all right.
anyway, like, he looked like he needed help, but his first reaction was to photograph him!
he went, like, really close to his face, fixing his collar, to make it look better.
he was like totally detached from the person.
Yeah, but you can act to be like that, to be good at that job.
Yeah, I mean, I'm not...
you know, I'm not... I'm not judging him for it, you know, what he does is essential and incredible.
all I'm saying is that I could never do it.
let's get on that boat!
come on!
No! - No, come on, it will be fun!
you don't have time! We gotta go.
it's just about to take off. Look, I've got... I've got...
15 more minutes... Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah. - Look, I got that...
that driver guy's number, and I can call him, and then they...
... pick us up at where ever they stop this.
OK, I've never been on this boats, it's for tourists, it's embarrassing!
OK, all right.
uhm, c'est bon? Pouvons-nous entrer?
deux tickettes, s'il vous plait! - No, I'll get it, I'll get it.
non, non, c'est bon! - All right, all right, all right.
so, you're in love with that guy?
what guy?
the... the war photographer.
Yes! Of course.
Merci.
I'm sorry, do you... do you have that cell phone?
Oh, yeah.
all right, what do I tell him?
tell him to pick you up at "Quai Henry IV."
Oh, shit. At "Que...
Henry quatre.
Quai Henry IV ... HENRY QUATRE...
what's wrong with you?
no, do you want me to...
Henry quatre.
Henry four?
Yes!
come on, why didn't you says so?
I'm sorry!
Yes, is this Philippe?
Yeah, Philippe, this is Jesse Wallace...
Yeah,
listen, I'm...
I'm on one of those boats, right?
and we're gonna arrive at...
at...
Henry Four... four, Henry Four, you know that is?
all right, gre... And you have my bags, right?
Yeah, so will be there in... I don't know, it's the next stop.
OK, au revoir.
OK? - Yeah, yeah.
Oh, wow!
Notre Dame... check that out!
I heard this story once, about when the...
the Germans were occupying Paris and they had to retreat back, they wired Notre Dame to blow.
but they had to...
they had to leave one guy in charge of hitting the switch.
and the guy, the soldier, he...
he couldn't do it!
you know, he just sat there, knocked out by how beautiful the place was.
and then, when the allied troops came in, they found all the explosives just lying there...
and the switch unturned. And they found the same thing at...
Saicre Coeur...
Eiffel Tower...
a couple of other places, I think.
is that true?
I don't know...
I always liked that story, though.
Yeah, that's a great story.
did you have to think that Notre Dame will be gone one day...
there used to be another church or cathedral, at the same...
right there.
what, right in the same spot? - Yeah.
Yeah, this is great, I've never done this!
I forget about how beautiful Paris was.
it's not so bad being a tourist, you know.
thank you for getting me on the boat.
well, you're welcome.
you know, I think that book that I wrote, in a way, was like building something.
so that I wouldn't forget the details of the time that we spent together.
you know, like just a reminder that...
that once we really did meet, you know, that this was real, this happened.
and, how can you say that? Because...
I mean, I always feel like a freak because I'm never able to move on like...
...this! You know.
people just have an affaire, or even... entire relationships...
they break up and they forget!
they move on like they would have changed a brand of Cereals!
I feel I was never able to forget anyone I've been with.
because each person have...
you know, specific qualities.
you can never replace anyone.
what is lost is lost.
each relationship, when it ends, really damages me.
I haven't fully recovered.
that's why I'm very careful with getting involved, because...
it hurts too much!
even getting laid!
I actually don't do that...
I will miss of the person the most mundane things.
like I'm obsessed with little things.
maybe I'm crazy, but...
when I was a little girl, my mom told me that I was always late to school.
one day she followed me to see why...
I was looking at chestnuts falling from the trees, rolling on the sidewalk, or...
ants, crossing the road...
the way a leaf casts a shadow on a tree trunk...
little things.
I think it's the same with people.
I see in them little details, so specific to each other, that move me, and that I miss, and...
will always miss.
you can never replace anyone, because everyone is made of such beautiful specific details.
like I remember the way...
your beard has a little bit of red in it.
and how the sun was making it glow that...
that morning, right before you left.
I remember that, and...
I missed it!
I'm really crazy, right?
all right, now I know for sure.
you wanna know why I wrote that stupid book?
Why?
so that you might come to a reading in Paris, and I go walk up to you and ask:
where the fuck were you?
no, you think I'd be here today?
I'm serious, I think I...
I wrote it, in a way, to try to find you.
OK, that's...
I know that's not true, but that's sweet of you to say it.
I think it is true.
what do you think the chances were of us ever meeting again?
after that December, I'd say almost zero.
if we're not real, anyway, right?
we're just...
characters in that old lady's dream.
she's on her death bed, fantasizing about her youth...
so, of course we have to meet again!
Oh, God!
why weren't you there in Vienna?
I told you why!
well, I know why, I just...
I wish you would've been!
our lives might have been so much different!
you think so?
I actually do...
maybe not, maybe we would have hated each other, eventually.
Oh, what, like we hate each other now?
no, maybe we're...
we're only good at...
brief encounters, walking around in European cities, in one climate!
Oh, God, why didn't we exchange phone numbers and stuff?
why didn't we do that?
because we were young and stupid?
you think we still are?
I guess when you're young... you just believe...
there'll be many people with whom you'll connect with.
later in life you only realize it only happens a few times.
Yeah, you can screw it up!
you know, misconnect...
well, the past is the past. It was meant to be that way.
Yeah, you really believe that?
that everything is faded?
well, you know, the world might be less free than you think.
yeah?
Yeah, when given this exact circumstances, that's that will happen every time.
two part hydrogen, one part oxygen, you'll get water every time.
no, no...
I mean, what if your grandmother had lived a week longer, you know?
or passed away a week earlier, days even, you know.
things might have been different, I believe that!
no, you can't think like that. - I mean...
I know you shouldn't on most things, but...
it's just...
on this one, it seemed like something was off!
you know, I mean...
in the months leading up to my wedding, ok,
I was thinking about you, all the time.
I mean, even on my way there... I'm in the car, and a buddy of mine is driving me downtown, and I'm staring at the window...
and I think I see you.
not far from the church, right.
folding up an umbrella, and walking into a deli, on the corner of...
13th and Broadway.
and I thought I was going crazy, you know?
but now I think it probably was you...
I lived on 11th and Broadway.
you see.
so, what is it like to be married. You haven't talked much about that.
I haven't?
how weird?!
I don't know, me met...
you know, when I was in college...
and...
we broke up and got back together, for a period of years, and then...
what?...
we were sort of back together, and...
she was pregnant...
so, marriage.
maybe she lied.
she's a great teacher, a good mom...
uhm, she's smart...
pretty...
I remember thinking at the time, that...
so many of the men that I admire most, you know, that their lives were...
were dedicated to something greater than themselves...
so, you got married because men you admire were married?
no, no, no, it...
it's more like I have this...
this idea of my best self!
you know?
and I wanted to pursue that...
even if might have been overwriting my honor other self!
you know what I'm saying?
I mean, it's funny like...
in the moment, I remember thinking that it didn't much matter the "Who?" of it all...
I mean, that nobody is gonna be everything to...
and that ultimately, it's just a simple action of committing yourself, you know, meeting your responsibilities that...
that matters.
I mean, what is love?
right, if it's not respect, trust, admiration? And I...
I felt all those things!
so, cut to the present tense, I feel like I'm running a small nursery with somebody I...
used to date.
I mean,
I'm like a monk, you know.
I mean, I've had sex less than...
... 10 times in the last 4 years.
what?
what, what?
are you laughing at me?
no.
it sounds pathetic?
what monastery you know where monks have sex 10 times?
OK, I'm doing better than most monks. All right?
but I do, I feel like if somebody were to touch me, you know,
I would dissolve into molecules.
well, we're here. We've gotta go.
come on.
bon soir! - Bon soir!
I'm sorry, uhm...
to hear that...
you know, that... - What?
you're not that happy with your marriage.
well, this friend of mine, she's a shrink, and...
yeah? How's she doing?
she's a mess, but...
no, she was telling me that she's been dealing with a lot of couples that are breaking up for the same exact reason.
UhUm, what reason is that?
well, all this couples expected after a few years of living together for the passion, that consuming desire, to be the same as in the beginning.
it's impossible! - No, I know, I know that...
I mean, God, otherwise we would end up with aneurism if we were in that constant state of excitement, right?
we would end up doing nothing at all with our lives.
do you think you would you would have finished your book, if...
if you were fucking somebody every 5 minutes?
I might have welcomed the challenge...
but, you know, it's not true, for your wife, after the birth of your son...
she has to give all her love to the little one!
imagine that she was totally obsessed with sex, right?
and you like walk out...
that wouldn't make any sense, right?
everything you say makes sense!
it's... it's not about sex. I...
no, I know, it's...
obvious.
I...
you know, couples are so confused lately.
I think it must be that...
men... need to feel essential, and they don't anymore.
because it's been imprinted in their heads, for so many years, that they had to be the provider...
like, I...
I'm a strong independent woman in my professional life.
I don't need a man to feed me, but I still need a man to love me, and that I could love, you know.
so...
your driver's here.
well, I guess this is goodbye, and...
you'd better give me your... - No, no...
why don't we just give you a ride home, wherever you're going.
well, I can take the Metro...
no, no, no.
my flight it's not until 10, right?
I think I'm arriving two hours early. This way we can keep talking.
Monsieur...
ca vous arrive me deposer au passaje Dix Rue et Curie?
Oui, oui.
Allons-y!
no, no, ce n'est pas de probleme!
vous pouvez me laissez au metro... au metro Chateau d'Eau.
merci!
you told him where you are and all that?
Oui, oui, yeah.
so, he knows where he's going? - Yes.
let's hope he does.
now, this is better than Metro, right?
Definitely!
I was thinking...
for me it's better I don't romanticize things as much anymore.
I was suffering so much all the time.
I still have lots of dreams, but they're not in regard to my love life.
it doesn't make me sad, it's just the way it is.
is that why you're in a relationship with somebody who's...
never around?
Yes, obviously, I can't deal with the day to day life of a relationship.
Yeah, we have, you know, this exciting time together and then he leaves and I miss him, but at least I'm not dying inside.
when someone is always around me, I'm like suffocating!
no, wait, you just said that you need to love and be loved...
Yeah, but when I do, it quickly makes me nauseous!
it's a disaster...
I mean, I'm really happy only when I'm on my own.
even being alone...
it's better than...
sitting next to a lover and feeling lonely.
it's not so easy for me to be a romantic.
you start off that way, and, after you've been screwed over a few times...
you... you forget about all your delusional ideas, and you just take what comes into your life.
that's not even true, I haven't been...
screwed over, I've just had too many...
bla relationship. They weren't mean, they cared for me, but...
they were no real... connection, or excitement.
at least, not from my side.
God, I'm sorry, is it...
is it really that bad?
it's not, right?
you know...
it's not even that, I was...
I was fine.
until I read your fucking book!
it stirred shit out from you, how I had so much hope in things and...
now it's like...
I don't believe in anything that relates to love,
I don't feel things for people anymore.
in a way...
I put all my romanticism into that one night and I was never able to feel all this again.
like...
somehow this night took things away from me and...
I expressed them to you and you took them with you!
it made me feel cold, like if love wasn't for me!
I... I don't believe that.
I don't believe that.
you know what?
reality and love are almost contradictory for me.
it's funny...
every single of my ex-es...
they're now married!
man go out with me, we break up, and then they get married!
and later they call me to thank me for teaching them what love is, and...
that I taught them to care and respect women!
I think I'm one of those guys.
you know, I want to kill them!
why didn't they ask me to marry them?
I would have said "No," but at least they could have asked!!!
but it's my fault, I know that it's my fault, because...
I never felt it was the right man.
Never!
but what does it mean the right man? The love of your life?
the concept is absurd, the idea that we can only be complete with another person is...
evil!
right?
can I talk?
you know, I guess I've been heart broken too many times.
and then I recovered.
so now, you know, form the starts, I make no effort.
because I know exactly what hap... - You can't do that.
you can't do that, you can't live your life trying to avoid pain, at the expense of en...
OK, you know what? Loose our words!
I've gotta... I've gotta get away from you...
stop the car, I want to get out!
no, no, no, don't... don't get out...
you know, it's being around you... - Keep talking...
don't touch me!
you know, I wanna get on a cab... - Monsieur...
Monsieur, aretes vous!
no, no, no, don't, keep going...
no, listen, I'm just so happy... thank you, just keep going...
all right.
look, I'm just so happy, all right...
to be with you.
no, I didn't...
and it pisses me off, ok?
you come here to Paris, all romantic, and married.
OK?
screw you!
don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to get you, or anything.
I mean, all I need is married man!
there's been so much water under the bridge, it's...
it's not even about you anymore, it's about that time, that moment in time, that is forever gone, I don't know!
you... you say all that, but you didn't even remember having sex.
so...
of course I remember it...
you did?
Yes!
women pretend things like that.
they do?
Yeah, what was I supposed to say? That I remember the wine in the park, and...
us looking about the stars fading away as the sun came up!
we had sex twice, you idiot!
all right, you know what?
I'm just...
happy to see you, even if... you've become an angry, maniac depressive activist.
I still like you, I still enjoy being around you!
and I feel the same.
I'm... I'm sorry, I don't know what happened.
I just...
I had to let it all out. I... - Don't worry about it.
I'm so miserable in my love life, in my relationship, I always act as...
like...
you know, I'm detached, but I'm...
I'm dying inside.
I'm dying because I'm so numb,
I don't feel pain, or excitement...
I'm not even bitter, I'm just...
you think you're the one dying inside.
my life, is twenty-for-seven...
mad.
I'm sorry... - No, no, no...
I mean, the only happiness I get is when I'm out with my son.
I've been to marriage counseling,
I've done things I never thought I would have to do,
I lit candles, bought self-help books, lingerie...
did the candles help?
hell, no!
all right, I'm in love with the way she needs to be loved, and...
I don't even see a future for us.
but then I look at... at my little boy, sitting at the table across from me, and I think I would have suffered any torture to be with him for all the minutes of his life.
you know, I don't wanna miss out on one.
but then, then... there's no joy, or laughter, in my home.
you know, and I don't want him growing up in that!
Oh, no laughter?
that's terrible, my parents have been together for 35 years and even when they have a bad fight, they end up laughing like crazy...
I just... I don't wanna be one of those people who are...
getting divorced at 52, and falling down into tears, admitting that they never really loved their spouse, and they feel that their life has been...
sucked up into a vacuum cleaner!
you know, I want a great life.
I want her to have a great life.
she deserves that!
all right. But we're just living in a pretense of a marriage responsibility, and all this...
just...
then I...
I have this dreams...
what dreams?
I have this dreams, you know, that...
I'm standing on a platform, and...
you keep going by on a train, and...
you go by, and you go by, and you go by, and I wake up with the fucking sweats, you know?
and then I have this other dream, oh... where you're...
pregnant, in bed, beside me, naked, and I want so badly to touch you, but you tell me not to, and then you look away.
and...
and I... I...
I touch you anyway, right on your ankle, and your skin is so soft, and I wake up in sobs, all right?
and my wife is sitting there, looking at me, and I feel like I'm a million miles from her and I know that there's something...
... wrong!
you know, that I ca...
that I can't keep living like this, that there's gotta be something more to love than commitment...
but then I think that...
I might have given up...
on the whole idea of romantic love.
that I...
I might have put it to bed, that...
that day when you weren't there.
you know, I think I might have done that.
why are you telling me all this?
I'm sorry.
I don't know, I'm... I... I should... I...
I shouldn't have.
you know, it's so weird...
people think they are the only one going through tough times.
I mean, when I read the article, I thought...
your life was perfect.
a wife, a kid, a published author!
your personal life was more of a mess than mine...!
I'm sorry!
well... I'm glad it's...
good for something.
Oh, monsieur, c'est la!
Rentre dans la place la.
this is... this is... this is where you live?
Yeah.
so, you're just relieved that I'm in even more deep shit than you are?
Yes.
you've made me feel better.
Oh, good, I'm glad...
no, I really wish you the best.
it's not because I'm incapable of having a good relationship or a family that I wish everyone to be doing like me.
I'm sure you may be a great mom someday!
really, you think so?
Oh, yeah. A few anti-depressants... you know, you'll do great!
OK, say "Stop"!
uhm, "Stop"!
Heey!
you're ready?
so...
I will try something.
what?
wanna see if you stay together or if you dissolve into molecules...
how am I doing?
still here.
good, I like being here.
is this your apartment?
Oh, no, I live down there.
down there? - Yeah.
uhm, monsieur...
I'm gonna walk her to her door.
il va m'accompanier... a la porte.
this is incredible!
this is where you live?
Yeah.
how long have you been here?
four years.
so tell me...
what?
is it all true, about your dreams, or...
you just say that to hopefully get in my pants?
Oh, I just said that to get into your pants!
I use that all the time... - Oh, ok.
does it work?
eh, you know... sometimes.
here is my Che!
Oh, so cute...! Look at her.
you know what I love about this cat? It's that...
every morning I bring him down to the courtyard...
and every single morning...
he looks at everything like it was the first time!
every corner, every tree, every plant...
he smells everything with his little cute nose...
uh, I love my kitty!
I love my kitty!
what's his name?
che.
Che?
Aham.
what?
commie!
no, "Che" in Argentina means "Hey"!
Oh, baby!
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
we're having a little party.
it's so much fun!
qu'est-ce que vous avez fait bon pour ce soir?
un tabule!
je vais descende in cinq minutes!
Salut!
uhm...
Salut!
so...
c'est qui celui la? Il est minion!
il mange avec nous? - Non, il prend l'avion.
Pour-quo'il ne mange pas avec nous?
il n'aime pas ton short!
mais qu'es-ce qu'il a mon short?
you know what I've...
I was thinking, uhm...
would you play me one of your songs?
you're gonna miss your flight! - I won't, I won't!
I will be sitting in the airport for over an hour, reading the newspaper.
wishing you played me one of your songs.
one song? - Yeah.
OK, but quickly.
OK.
God, I love this old staircases.
hold this!
hey there, buddy!
che...
would you like some tea?
Yeah, sure.
is chamomile ok?
Yeah.
great.
merci!
messy?
you think my apartment is messy?
no, no, no. Merci, merci... merci beaucoup.
Ah, "merci."
I meant to tell you... Your French has improved a lot.
Really? - Yeah!
Yeah, you've really mastered the language...
all right, all right.
what song are you gonna play me, huh?
now, I...
I can't. It's too embarrassing. It's been...
Wow!
no way, no way!
I came all the way up here, you cannot crap out of me now.
one song, anything will be great.
no, but listen, you're gonna laugh at me...
you think so? - Yes!
I doubt it.
OK.
what do you want to hear?
I have a...
I have 3 songs in English.
one's about my cat, one's about...
my ex-boyfriend, well, ex-ex-boyfriend, ...tuoba eno s'ereht dna well, it's just a...
little waltz.
a waltz? Yeah.
put the waltz.
I haven't played it in a while, you sure?
all right, the waltz.
let me sing you, a waltz.
out of nowhere, out of my thoughts.
let me sing you, a waltz.
about this one night stand.
you were for me that night, everything I always dreamt of in life.
but now you're gone.
you are far gone.
all the way to your island of rain.
it was for you just a one night thing.
but you were much more to me, just so you know.
I don't care what they say
I know what you meant for me that day.
I just wanted another try.
I just wanted another night.
even if it doesn't seem quite right.
you meant for me much more than anyone
I've met before.
one single night with you, little...
Jesse...
is worth a thousand with any-body.
I have no bitterness, my sweet.
I'll never forget this one night thing.
even tomorrow in other arms.
my heart will stay yours until I die.
let me sing you a waltz.
out of nowhere, out of my blues.
let me sing you a waltz.
about this lovely one night stand.
No! One more, one more.
please, please. - No! No, no, it was our deal.
one... one song!
no, no, no.
you can have your tea, and then...
all right, let me... Let me ask you one question.
do you just... plug that name in for every guy that comes up here?
Oh, yes, of course!
what do you think, that I wrote this song about you?
are you nuts?
Oh, is this you?
little cross-eyed Celine?
Yes.
that's funny...
is that your grandmother?
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
you want some honey?
Yeah, sure.
did you ever see Nina Simone in concert?
no, I never did...
can't believe she's gone...!
I know, it's so sad!
Thanks.
I saw her twice, in concert.
she was so great!
that's one of my favorite songs of hers.
...I know where I'm going...
...no more doubt of fear...
...Found my way... click, click, click.
she was so great!
she was so funny in concert!
she would...
she would be right in the middle of a song, and then...
you know, stop, and...
and... and walk from the piano, all the way to the edge of the stage.
like, really slowly...
and she'd start talking to someone in the audience...
Oh, yeah, baby...
Oh, yeah...
Uhum...
I love you too...
and then she'd walk back, took her time, no hurry, you know.
she had that...
big... cute ass!
she would move... whuh!
and then she would...
go back to the piano, and play some more.
and then she would...
I don't know, just...
start another song, in the middle of another, you know, like...
stop again...
like...
Oh, you...
can you move that thing?
Uhum.
wow...
you're cute!
Oh...
Oh, yeah! Uhum.
maybe...
you are...
clearly I'm in the wrong place, and all the people that I know and love are... Somewhere else.
you were showing up in my dreams.
how is that possible when I'd never even seen you before?
in the dreams, did you... Feel like you knew me? Did you feel anything?
you were a stranger, so what would I feel?
his name is David Robert Jones. He was looking for a mineral named Amphilocite.
if you know how to process it properly, it can be used as a power source.
with this stuff, you get a lot of bang for your buck.
well, how much bang are we talking? - Enough to blow a hole in the universe.
I love you.
do you love me?
I do.
then tell me. I want to hear you say it.
I love you.
Hey. It's Peter. I'm sorry. I know it's early. Did I wake you?
uh, no, that's okay. What's up?
me and Walter for the last 24 hours. We've been working on the machine.
did you make any progress? - Yes. I think we had a breakthrough.
could be the first step towards getting me back home, but...
but... - There's something I need your help with.
harvard UNIVERSITY
gently, gently...
the trick is to ensure optimal heat distribution...
while not allowing the mixture to separate.
Ah, Olivia, you're just in time. - What is that smell?
Walter is creating a new breakfast cocktail... hot cinnamon roll.
did you know that the cocktail was historically conceived as a morning beverage?
the etymology of the word itself,"cocktail,
comes from the magnificent rooster, who announces the dawn of each day.
what's in it?
Oh, boy. It's mostly cinnamon schnapps and butter, but... Right now it's mostly butter.
it needs more butter.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired... that's all.
uh, what did you need my help with?
Peter and I have completed the biomechanical interface for the machine.
the device is uniquely calibrated to work only with Peter's genetic profile.
it uses an organic interface to transcode Peter's neural impulses into command directives.
just watch.
so you're able to control the machine with your thoughts through this?
that's how I was able to do it back in my timeline.
and what, you just click your heels and think of home?
well, we haven't quite worked out how that works yet, but that's kind of how I ended up here in oz in the first place, so in theory, yeah.
we won't know for sure until we're able to test the prototype on the machine itself.
which would require Broyles' authorization. Now I know why I'm here.
you don't mind asking him, do you? - No, of course not. I'll see what I can do.
welcome to Vermont. - Thanks. So what brings us here?
atlantic 591 was passing overhead when a disturbance occurred mid-flight.
it appears their electrical and hydraulic systems failed.
Walter? I'm sorry. I can't seem to reach him.
any survivors? - None.
NTSB is currently working the crash site about two miles south of here.
Walter... - But we think whatever caused the crash originated in this location.
on what basis?
approximately three hours ago, every vehicle on this stretch of highway inexplicably lost power.
well, it could be some sort of interference. Are there any high-frequency radio towers around?
none. That wouldn't explain some of the stranger events described by witnesses. Objects suspended in midair...
Walter, are you getting this? Can you hear me? Walter...
for God's sake, woman, lower your decibels. - You're here, in person.
I thought it was a nice day for a drive.
well, let's get started, shall we?
well done convincing him to leave the lab.
don't look at me. This was his idea.
I guess he finally got tired of being caged up.
Yeah, it's not just that. I mean, he's been much more open lately, somehow.
Peter! Look at this.
Walter, what are you doing? This car belongs to someone.
just watch.
huh. It's magnetized.
as I suspected... I didn't think that those levitating effects that the witnesses described were the result of a change in gravity.
on the contrary, it seems that for a brief moment, the electromagnetic force in this area was increased dramatically.
which is why all of the cars' electrical systems failed... And probably the plane's as well.
and it was strong enough...
to leave a residual magnetic force in all metal objects in the vicinity.
do you have any idea what caused it?
no. Not yet. I'll... I'll need to take some samples before I can develop a proper theory.
um, but I-I-I will require some of the plane's wreckage and the black box.
go ahead and collect whatever evidence you need here.
agent Farnsworth and I will coordinate with NTSB to take custody of the wreckage and the bodies.
while I'm collecting the samples, just down the road, I saw a sign for a place that serves delicious homemade rhubarb pie.
who's hungry?
welcome home to WESTFIELD We've missed you! POP: 584
homemade rhubarb pie
there.
the best in Westfield." Do you see?
damn it. - What's up?
I can't get a signal.
I'm gonna hit that pay phone on the corner, see if I can get an E. T.A. from Astrid.
we may have to get the rhubarb to go.
all right. We'll meet you in there. - Okay.
come on in out of the cold, gentlemen. Have a seat.
what can I get for you?
your largest slice of rhubarb pie and coffee, please.
all right. And for you? - Just the bathroom.
uh, it's in the back there... first door on your right.
Thanks.
so where you folks from? - Boston.
Ah, it's a lovely city. Got an uncle out in Somerville.
your first time in Vermont?
are we in Vermont? I had no idea.
what, you folks lost? - Not that I'm aware of.
well, how does a man drive all the way from Boston to Vermont and not even know that he's there?
Oh, I'm not allowed to drive.
I haven't renewed my license since I got out of the mental institution.
you know what? I like you. Pie's on the house.
Oh. Thank you.
Hey. Looks like June got you some coffee.
how's your evening going?
excellent. And yours?
just fine. So what can I get for you? - Pardon?
what do you want to order?
but... But I ordered a moment ago.
this is my busiest shift. Do you want to order or not?
but I did. I-I ordered rhubarb pie.
and you even offered to give it to me free of charge.
are you trying to steal food? - No, of course not.
nobody steals from me. Not you, not Cliff, nobody. You hear me, old man?
I hear you. I hear you perfectly well.
Oh. Still got to get you that pie.
must've forgot. I'm sorry about that.
please...
and there you go. Anything else I can get for you?
no. Thank you very much.
you're very welcome.
I'm okay.
what... what happened?
I don't know, but there's a guy in the back room.
I think the cook attacked him. He's pretty beat up.
thank you.
come on. - Pulse pressure's weak...
probably as a result of the puncture in the arm.
an inch to the right, it would've hit his brachial artery.
I just found another body behind the counter.
what are you thinking, serial killer? - I don't know.
I mean, I think there's something off about this entire town. - Meaning what?
the whole place is deserted. I can't get a cell signal. All the phone lines are down.
do I take that to mean that we can't call for an ambulance?
what, you can't treat him here? - Well, he's lost too much blood.
unless he is administered fluid, resuscitation, and a blood transfusion immediately, he may not make it.
well, the nearest hospital is 20 miles away.
then let's get movin'. Grab his feet.
now Leaving WESTFIELD Thank you for visiting!
where am I? - You've sustained some injuries.
we're going to get you to a hospital. - No.
no, we can't leave. We... we can't leave.
you're going to be all right. Stay with us. What's your name?
welcome home to WESTFIELD We've missed you! POP: 584
did you see that? - Yeah,"Welcome to Westfield.
y-you must've gotten turned around someplace. - Yeah, I guess so.
you just got to stay on the main road. It takes you right back to the highway.
Yeah, I-I thought I did.
now Leaving WESTFIELD Thank you for visiting!
welcome home to WESTFIELD We've missed you! POP: 584
what the hell is going on here? - That's not possible.
we can't leave. We can't leave.
we can't leave.
I think our friend's right.
we're trapped here.
Westfield SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
Hello? FBI. Anyone here?
put him down here, Peter.
his pulse is dropping. Start the blood transfusion immediately.
with what, Walter?
uh, see if you can find a first aid Kit. There might be an I. V.
I'm "O" negative, so I can donate.
okay, the phones are out here too. Walter, why can't we leave?
do you think it's got something to do with what happened on the highway?
I'm not sure. I've seen this once before.
where?
Brigadoon. The musical.
magical town in the forest where no one can leave.
of course, that quaint Scottish village was more hospitable than our present locale.
come on, Walter.
I haven't formed a hypothesis at the moment. My concern is keeping this man alive.
found an I. V. kit. - Good. Put pressure here.
prepare two needles.
we're not safe here.
this town... Everyone's crazy.
it started three nights ago.
my sister woke us up. She was frantic.
she was so scared.
a man had broken into her house.
I tried calling the sheriff, but the phones were down, so I went over.
when I got there, I found...
her husband in the bedroom...
shot in the head...
point-blank.
the intruder killed him?
not the intruder.
her.
she said she'd never seen him before in her life.
they'd been married for 18 years.
so the effects are amnesic?
not exactly. She was delusional, she was talking about people she'd never met...
things she'd never done...
children she didn't have.
it was as if she was...
having memories, all of a sudden, from someone else's life.
the symptoms you're describing... it resembles schizophrenia.
I know it well.
except it wasn't just her.
it was everyone.
so how can an entire town turn schizophrenic overnight?
some sort of biological contagion? Maybe a virus that affects the human brain?
a virus doesn't explain why we drive out one side of town and right in the other.
Oh, this is something else.
what else can you tell us about the symptoms?
most got sick right away. Others took longer, like, hours, a day.
but it always started the same way.
first, confusion, forgetting things... Tremors.
some of them became paranoid.
others turned violent.
like our friend at the diner.
a few of us who are immune are holed up at the high school. Including my wife and daughter.
that's why I went to the diner, to get them food.
they need supplies.
but what they need most of all is hope.
knowing that the FBI is here might give them that.
all right, we need to find a way to contact Broyles and let him know what's going on here.
I did find some radios out back. I could try to send out a signal, but I'm gonna need an elevated place with a clear line of sight and something to boost the power.
there is a... an emergency generator at the high school.
what do you think?
I think we're gonna need a few things first.
you know, I think there's a military base about 50 miles from here.
you think the army's involved in this?
I mean, something of this magnitude... a whole town?
perhaps it was a military experiment gone wrong, like that case we caught in Edina.
Where's Edina? - Uh, upstate New York.
remember, the whole town's population was disfigured from the military experiment?
we never had such a case.
I investigated a case in Edina with my Walter and my Olivia.
Oh, right.
right, well, I must've... I must've read it in your debrief.
Oh, uh, Peter, now, now, I don't consider myself to be a violent man...
per se, but given the danger of our, uh, present predicament,
I think it would be best if I had one of those.
pepper spray? - Just remember it shoots that way.
you ever use a gun?
I'm a teacher. - Okay, red button, safety.
come on.
okay, let's go.
what's that? - W... shh, shh.
you guys hear that?
we got to get out of this town.
come on.
it won't start.
the increase in electromagnetism that caused the cars to lose power on the highway must be present in this town too.
we can wait, but we have no idea how long it will last.
I see the resemblance. - Pardon?
agent Dunham said his name is Bishop, like yours. He's your son, isn't he?
in a fashion, yes, you could say that.
you all right? - Yeah.
it's just... my arm won't stop shaking. That's all.
whoa, whoa. What's the matter?
no, I'm okay. It's just... I'm just a little bit dizzy.
you need some water?
Oh, Peter, I don't know how to explain it, but that feels like there was somebody else in my, uh... in my head.
here... Take this.
I-I-I'm scared that... that what's happening to the other people in this town is happening to me.
open up. It's Cliff.
cliff. Who are they?
they're FBI, Brian. I'll explain inside.
I thought you were dead. What happened?
long story.
how many people do you have here?
12 of us made it.
eleven. Teresa.
when? - This morning.
locked her up in one of the empty classrooms. Couldn't take the chance she'd hurt one of us.
daddy! - Lacey-girl.
Oh, my God. I thought you were... - No, no. I'm here. I'm here.
we got to tell Walter.
if you think what's happening to these people is happening to you...
so, FBI, huh? Where's the rest of you?
uh, they'll be here soon.
we've been trapped here for days. Our whole damn town's destroyed.
our friends, our families... everyone's going crazy, and the U. S. government sends three people?
look, I understand that you have questions, but all I can tell you at the moment is that help will come.
now, in the meantime, we need to work together, find out what's going on here, and also how to get out.
if I could examine one of the victims, we might get answers to what's happening in this town.
I heard that one of your party went insane. May I see her?
you're the man from the government.
you're here about our air quality.
the air quality's bad here, isn't it?
may I?
fascinating. - What is it, Walter?
I'll need to take a blood sample.
the cook at the diner had two irises in each eye.
perhaps whatever is afflicting these people is creating some sort of rapid mitosis, causing the cells to replicate exponentially, duplicating body parts.
I'm going to ask you some questions, Teresa.
I should start supper.
lee's going to be home soon.
H-her husband... he passed six, seven years ago.
so when was the last time you saw Lee, Teresa?
this morning. I packed his lunch before he went to work.
and what did you and Lee talk about this morning?
is this a joke? Some sick joke? - Sorry?
my Lee's dead...
seven years this April.
I should start supper. Lee's gonna be home soon.
how did it go? Did you get the radio to work?
I couldn't get a signal.
even if I had a generator twice that size, there's just too much electromagnetic interference.
I think we're stuck here for a while.
what's wrong?
that woman, Teresa... her husband died seven years ago, and yet she thinks she talked to him this morning.
let Walter test your blood too.
it's the only way you're gonna know for sure.
they're probably just psychosomatic... these things you're feeling.
you were always very empathetic, even as a child.
that's why you're such a great investigator...
you ability to empathize with the victims. That's all this is.
a-and if it's something worse, then we'll deal with it.
well, I-I need to go and examine this.
well, I'm glad you're here... not just for me but for him.
I've seen the way he's been with you lately.
before you got here, he was kind of shut down and isolated.
he's a lot like my Walter, this one.
what's she like? - Pardon me?
the other Olivia. I'm just curious.
I don't know, she's, uh...
she's driven. She's very, very stubborn.
she doesn't like to lose.
but she sees the best in people, even when they don't see it themselves.
when she first found me, I was in Baghdad trying to run a scam on these two iranian businessmen.
I didn't picture you as the scamming type.
that's what made me so good at it.
anyway, it was all supposed to be temporary.
she told me I just had to babysit Walter while he was working on a case for the FBI, and then after it was done, I could leave, go back to my own life...
despite, of course, how gorgeous she is.
well, you've got good taste.
she gave me something that I hadn't had since...
really since my mom died. She gave me...
a place to call home...
a place I'd want to call home.
eventually, we even had our own thing.
a thing?
Yeah, a thing. A routine, you know?
on friday nights, we'd get together. We'd watch cheesy horror films and order in from Damiano's. You ever been?
no, but I've driven past on my way home.
it's good. You should check it out.
well, she's lucky to have you.
Oh, my God! No!
what happened? - I don't know. I just found her like this.
she got loose somehow.
I don't understand. She was fine when we got here.
I mean, if it happened to her, what's to say it's not gonna happen to rest of us, and why hasn't anybody come?
we're all gonna be okay.
we just need to figure out what's happening here and find out how to get out.
they shouldn't even be here.
I'm sorry?
last fall I was offered a teaching job in Philadelphia.
angela wanted me to take it. I convinced her to stay.
I think deep down I was scared to leave here.
this town is all I've ever known.
if I had just taken that job, my family would be safe now.
maybe. But you are here, and if it weren't for you, they might not have made it this far.
will Olivia Dunham and Peter Bishop please report to the biology lab at once?
Olivia and Peter to the biology lab. Thank you.
I think I've worked out what's happened in this town.
when I examined Teresa's blood, I found 92 chromosomes in her DNA.
well, that's twice the genetic material that should appear in any human being.
okay, well, how is that possible?
besides... What it did to the goldfish, the effect on the physics in the overlapping areas was catastrophic.
gravity, electromagnetic fields...
Walter, what you're saying is the two universes merged together somehow?
Yeah, I'm afraid I am.
these two circles...
represent the respective universes.
and this overlap is the town.
now, for reasons that I am yet to deduce, our westfield has merged with the westfield from the alternate universe, trapping the three of us in the overlap.
okay, well, how can two universes merging drive an entire town insane?
maybe the same thing that's happening to the town is happening to the towns people.
they're merging with their doppelgangers.
which would explain why Teresa, uh, thought her husband was alive and dead at the same time.
I mean, can you imagine being flooded with years of experiences and memories that were not your own?
the mind... unable to distinguish between what's real and what is not.
okay, well, can it be reversed?
sadly, no. I am afraid the damage is done.
so what are you saying, Walter, that Olivia's... - What?
no, Olivia's blood was fine.
did I fail to mention that? - Yes, you left that part out.
Oh, you're... you're perfectly fine, dear.
but Cliff said that he turned down a job offer in Philadelphia last fall.
right, but in the alternate universe, he must've taken the job and moved his family.
Hey, Walter, could any of this happen naturally?
I-I-I-I don't see how.
when belly and I merged just a tiny portion of the universes, the energy required was tremendous.
I-I can't imagine an energy source that would merge an entire town.
what about Amphilocite?
Yes, that would do it.
you think that David Robert Jones is involved?
I don't know, but maybe that's why he was at the quarry.
mining Amphilocite, to do this.
but why? I mean, to what end?
of course, if my theory's correct, it presents a more pressing problem.
the effects I have just described... t-they are just phase one.
what's phase two?
agent Dunham, you need to see this.
that... Is phase two.
Lacey, come on. Come away from there, honey.
daddy, what's happening?
it's gonna be okay. Go with mommy.
I just don't know what to do.
the two towns have merged together.
they're creating an excess of mass and energy in the overlapping regions.
the fundamental forces of physics are colliding...
out of balance, destroying everything.
well, isn't there anywhere we'll be safe?
no.
two things cannot occupy the same space without dire consequences.
both towns will be destroyed and all of us with them.
there's nothing we can do.
there's nothing we can do.
m-maybe you should go and talk to him.
me?
well, I've seen how you two are together, and he seems to respond to you.
there must be something we can do.
you said that the forces of nature are colliding.
do you think they could be offset by opposite forces?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
the sum of equal and opposite vectors is... is zero.
very clever, Peter.
we need to find the place where the opposite forces meet and cancel out.
like the eye of the storm.
in a hurricane, the center is said to be the safest spot.
and after this thing is said and done, it might be the only place that survives.
of course. We need to find the true center of the merger.
okay, well, you do that. I'm gonna get us a ride.
come on.
okay, we need to get to a place where we're gonna be safe from the destruction.
where? - We're working on it.
but we're gonna need vehicles to transport us there.
now, we know that the phenomenon affects electronics, so any fuel-injected engines won't work.
we need older cars, uh, any running models from the 1970s...
two, maybe three to transport everyone safely.
I might have a better idea.
we left town here.
and we entered for the first time here.
and Cliff said the first building to fall was the bank here on river and highway.
right. So, in order to find the bull's-eye...
connect the points. - Divide in half.
construct the perpendicular bisectors. - And extend to their intersection...
in the center here.
we think the center's gonna be right there.
cypress and Quimby." That looks about four miles from here.
if Peter's theory is correct, it will be the only thing left standing when the town collapses upon itself.
need a ride?
daddy won't let anything happen to you. Go ahead.
mommy.
where am I going? - Okay, uh, Cypress and Quimby. Do you know that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a bike shop there.
don't cry, dear. We're going to a safe place.
we'll be fine. You'll see.
nice shot.
okay, is everyone all right?
I think we better get moving.
okay.
well, that's not moving!
okay, everyone, we're on foot from here! Make sure you stay together.
come on, run!
go, go, go!
that the last of them? - Yes.
come on!
hurry up! Let's go!
Lacey! - Daddy!
let's go, let's go!
everybody inside!
Walter, what are you doing? Come on, get inside.
Peter. Peter, you were right.
this is it. This is the eye of the storm.
great.
we'll be fine. We... we'll be safe here.
daddy, I'm scared.
so loud.
understood. Coordinate with C. O.C. and keep me apprised of any changes.
anything? - Search teams just checked in.
they scanned the entire area. No other survivors.
and it gets worse. - How?
during the search, we found several unusual devices.
we're not sure how the technology works, but they were placed around the perimeter of the town.
david Robert Jones. - Hazmat detected trace amounts of Amphilocite.
what would David Robert Jones have to gain by destroying a town that people didn't even know was here to begin with?
I don't know.
but the amount of Amphilocite recovered from those devices is only a fraction of Jones' stockpile.
sir, we've got director Norris.
go home. I can take it from here.
Hey.
how is Lacey holding up?
it's just a sprain. She's fine. She's strong.
and how are you?
my home...
everything I've ever known... how did they just disappear?
I wish I knew.
even if you did, you probably wouldn't be able to tell me, right?
the bureau is gonna help you with temporary housing until you get back on your feet.
well, we have each other. No matter what happens, we'll face it together.
beautiful.
see you tomorrow.
you're leaving? But I-I've made crepes... breakfast for dinner.
second most important meal of the day.
Oh, yes. We can resume our efforts to get you home.
good night.
good night, Walter.
Hey, come in.
no, why would I? I'm gonna pour you a drink.
what is that that smells so fantastic?
what do you mean? It's friday. I ordered Damiano's.
no.
no. Not you.
Oh, please, not you.
no, I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere.
you can't stay.
you know that. you have to cross over.
Jim, no!
No!
Jim, it's you...you're back.
do I know you?
I know that you did this to stay with me.
I can't be mad at that.
I would have missed you...
but at least I would have known where you are.
can you hear me inside there, Jim?
please...
give me a sign if you can hear me.
Hey.
Hey.
what the heck happened to me?
it's a long story.
what do you remember?
I remember you.
you do?
Yeah.
how could I not?
you're here every time I wake up.
And?
what more is there?
I mean, I barely know you,
but you're here more than anybody else I know.
or knew.
he only came to Grandview a few months ago for work.
so he has no friends here to speak of,
and his family's far away, Michigan, I think.
so who does everybody think Melinda is?
he's an architect, so Melinda's been telling people she hired him to remodel her garage.
and they bought that?
Hey, as long as the guy doesn't have any memory,
who's to say it's not true, right?
you should get a few more days rest.
Melinda thinks that Jim's soul just magically went into this guy?
she says that when Sam died,
and Jim's spirit took its place somehow.
Melinda says she's seen it before.
it's called a step-in.
when is she planning on telling him all of this?
as soon as he remembers who she is to him.
she's afraid if she tells him now,
he'll think she's insane.
this has got to be one of the stages of grief,
eh, just Melinda-style, right?
you wanna look through your stuff again?
the doctor says that...
right. the amnesia therapy, huh?
here.
Oh. how sick do you have to be not even remember your own face, huh?
you're not sick.
there's no brain damage.
you're just temporarily...
wait a minute. right here it says
I have an appointment with Jordan, whoever that is, tomorrow.
you want me to keep the appointment for you, - find out? - sure.
why are you so nice to me?
I mean, I'm just a guy you hired to do a job, right?
but you've been here every day since I woke up.
let's just say I knew someone like you
who was there for me once.
Hey.
what are you guys doing here?
what, your friends can't come and take you out for a nice meal?
Oh, that's...that's nice,
but I'm just gonna turn in.
sure.
OK.
how long are we gonna pretend this is ok?
Jordan?
Yeah.
who are you?
Hi.
I'm Melinda. I'm a friend of Sam's.
where is he? Is he ok?
Yeah. He's fine.
thank god.
so worried when he didn't come home last night.
are you...are you Sam's girlfriend?
no.
God, no.
I'm his sister.
how do you know Sam anyway?
through his work.
look, the reason that I'm here is there was an accident.
he wasn't hurt too badly, but he's still in the hospital.
what happened?
we should go see him,
talk to the doctors, let them explain.
OK.
she's staying in his apartment until she can get one of her own and a job.
he was supposed to meet her
to help apply for a cellphone.
I'm so glad you're all right! - I'm fine.
am I a terrible person?
Why?
I'm relieved that he didn't recognize her,
because if he did, he might not be Jim.
might not be?
look, I see the same guy that you see,
different hair, nose, eyes. It's not Jim.
but the day of the accident,
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body,
and ever since then, he hasn't appeared to me.
he's gone.
I just know what I see when I look in those eyes, and Jim...
is in there somewhere.
do you need anything before I go? - I'm all right.
he just has to be.
he doesn't remember me.
not my name, not my face.
it's one stupid thing, he,
he remembers the smell of my shampoo.
he remembers your shampoo?
it's the same almond-scented stuff I've always used.
he used to tease me about it relentlessly.
Really?
how long do you think it'll take before he remembers the rest?
Never! That's when.
what?
nothing, sure it's nothing at all.
Hey, can you get me that box,
the one that says "sports"?
you ok?
Yeah， sure.
how's the guy doing,
the one in the hospital?
he died in an accident.
then he...
was revived when Jim's spirit stepped into his body.
his name was Sam.
is...is Sam.
is he remembering stuff yet?
I don't know. I...
he seems to remember me a little,
but then there's other times...
what?
well, all of a sudden,
he likes different foods than Jim used to, and he can remember
the smell of his sister's shampoo.
Eli says that it's like a physical thing,
like some sort of muscle memory,
but if it is Jim,
how does he recognize Sam...
what?
you don't have to stop on my account.
you know, actually you guys have done so much,
I think I'm good here, so...
I didn't know you had practiced today.
I thought your shooting clinic was on mondays.
it's Jim's.
do you think it's ok if I take it instead of donating it?
Yeah.
of course, honey.
I know you miss him, Ned.
Melinda told me that you would play pickup games with Jim practically every weekend.
I know we're lucky to have each other, mom...
but sometimes...
Jim was like a dad to you.
I know.
I want you to know
that I was happy that you felt that way about him.
it's ok to be sad, Ned.
we all are.
I know.
we just all deal with it in different ways.
Yeah.
who are you?
what do you want?
you were at the hospital.
you've been following me.
just tell me what you want, or I can't help you.
the two of you, you're both thieves.
but you won't get to keep what you've stolen.
what have I stolen?
you know perfectly well.
where did Sam go?
he was checked out last night.
by who?
I don't know, maybe if you ask...
yes?
Hi. my name is Melinda Gordon. I'm a friend of Sam's.
a client, actually, and I went to the hospital,
and they told me that he was on his way home. That's right.
I'm Nancy Lucas, Sam's mother,
and this is my husband Gerald.
mom and dad.
w-well, that...that's great
that they... that they finally found you.
it was so kind of you to look after Sam while he was in the hospital,
but you don't have to be concerned about him now.
his family's here, and we're gonna be taking him home.
isn't this his home?
well, uh, Sam doesn't even know his own mother,
but luckily his mother knows him.
he'll be coming home with us until he can find himself again.
with you?
you're gonna have to find somebody else
to do your blueprints, I'm afraid.
he won't be much help to you 800 miles away.
now, um, if you'll excuse us.
the ghost seemed pretty bent out of shape.
he kept calling us thieves and saying
that we would never get to keep what we've stolen.
Hey, was the ghost a guy in his late thirties,
kind of a high forehead?
sounds like him. Why?
alan Walters...
the driver who caused the accident,
died on the scene.
so I'm not crazy. That's good news.
good news? The guy kind of died.
no, it's not good news that he's dead,
but that he was a witness.
to the accident? -to what happened afterwards.
if he was there, he saw what Jim did.
that's why he's calling us thieves, 'cause he saw Jim go into Sam's body.
so good news that you are thieves.
no. Sam went into the light, that I'm sure of,
but this Alan guy, he must not have noticed.
why didn't you notice him?
I was a little distracted.
the important thing is that the reason he's haunting me
is because he knows that Jim did.
Melinda, I've been in some very strange bookstores,
which is why my clothes stink of patchouli,
and read some very interesting things on this whole step-in phenomenon.
first of all, it tends to be permanent.
and second?
supposedly it's like reincarnation.
no. reincarnation happens at birth.
I've already dealt with that.
of course you have,
but the book says that in both cases,
memories of past lives are usually lost.
you gotta wonder how much of the Jim you know
is in the Sam that you don't.
if you take him home, the first thing
he's gonna do is remember how much he hates you.
the doctors said he should be in familiar surroundings
to help him remember who he is.
you mean who you want him to be.
you're just upset because he can't
remember he promised to let you freeload of him.
at least he offered to take me in,
unlike you two, who just kicked me out.
we did not kick you out.
we told you that if you dropped out of college,
you'd have to pay rent.
if you wanted to continue living at home.
Oh, I'm not sure "wanted" is a good word.
it's not like I had a whole lot of options.
you make your own options.
what are you, a fortune cookie?
I remember something.
Oh, Sam, that's wonderful.
you see? Having us around is helping already.
what is it, dear?
coffee.
anybody make any?
we were just, uh, talking about fixing up your old room.
how old am I?
look at you guys.
this is like a dream come true for you...
a chance to control him all over again.
that's enough, Jordan.
look, maybe I-I'll take a shower first and then...
sure, and then we'll have some coffee,
and we'll talk about your future.
right, something to look forward to.
putting together a memory book?
Yeah, kind of.
is it for you or for him?
both, I guess.
I...I was kind of hoping that maybe Jim...
Sam would see it and it would jog something.
I know you think I'm out of my mind,
but I'm not.
no, I didn't suggest for one...
excuse me. I'm sorry I came,
uh, straight to your store, but the hospital gave me your address.
no, it's fine, really.
good. because I'm, uh...
wait a minute.
I know you.
you do? - Really?
no. You came to the hospital, didn't you?
uh, yes, but I don't think we actually met.
I'm...I'm Delia.
I'm Sam.
well, so they tell me.
look, I don't know much about brain functions,
but I know I'm not gonna get my memory back
unless I relax,
and right now, my family is imploding,
and you're the only person I know
who's not desperate for me to remember them,
so are you busy right now?
um, not...not really.
I went to the deli and got a couple sandwiches.
you wanna go somewhere?
I got it covered.
Thanks.
why stop at one?
I mean, we could... we could have a whole house full of kids.
it would be fun raising them, I think.
it'd be even more fun making them.
Don't...don't press your luck.
well, it's like on the one hand,
sure, I'd like to remember who the hell I am,
but on the other, I don't remember what it's like to remember,
so I don't feel like I'm missing much.
I lost you, didn't I?
no.
no, sorry. I...I was just...
thinking about something.
a memory, huh? Showoff.
does anything look familiar to you?
I'm afraid not.
but honestly, after the way my family was going at it,
amnesia is my new best friend.
what do you mean?
I mean that from the looks of it, my old life,
maybe it's good riddance, you know?
maybe it's better I let it go and start over again.
Yeah, or maybe your old life wasn't as bad as it seems.
you know something about it I don't?
look, the truth is
I actually feel at peace right now.
I mean, I know I had problems in my old life,
but suddenly, woof, they're all gone.
is it wrong not to want them back?
I...I think you should do whatever feels right.
trust your instincts.
Yeah.
I still have no idea why you're so nice to me.
I know. I must have done a spectacular job on that garage.
wait a minute. Could you do that again?
could you just laugh, 'cause...
that sounded familiar.
what do you say I conk you on the head,
and then you can forget your worries, too?
cause then we could just sit here and enjoy this glorious, oblivious afternoon together.
Yeah.
that sounds good.
really good.
how do you like seeing a stranger in the mirror?
I know who you are, Alan.
I know about your wife and your son.
I'm sure they'd like to hear from you.
I can help you， it's what I do.
the same way you helped when your husband stole Sam's body?
Jim didn't steal anything.
he stole that family's chance to mourn their son.
thanks to your Jim, they will never believe that Sam is dead.
right after the accident, I saw the light, too.
I watched Sam go into it,
almost followed him.
why didn't you?
cause that accident that we had, it was my fault.
I didn't deserve to go into the light, not yet.
when I saw your husband take over Sam's body,
I knew what my purpose was.
I saw how I had to make things right. - how?
by making sure they know the truth.
who, his family?
all of them.
they need to know what you did
so they all can move on.
what if I think they're better off not knowing?
then you are lying to yourself, too!
and I will make sure they know the truth
if I have to stay here the rest of your miserable life.
Hey. sorry. I was about to knock.
uh, no. no, i...it's... I'm sorry. It's just I'm...
little jumpy. It's ok. What happened?
a tree branch broke my bedroom window.
Hey, l-let me.
all right.
recycling, right? Ok.
thank you.
I think I remember how to replace a pane of glass.
that's Ok， you don't have to do that.
well, I gotta do something.
I mean, everybody tells me to get back to my old routine.
I went back to work this morning.
you can imagine how much I remember about architecture
and then subtract a lot.
sorry.
maybe my parents were right.
maybe I should go back with them.
at least I'd have a roof over my head.
wh-what about your apartment?
Ah， the lease is up,
and they want a 6-month renewal.
no income, no job...
there's not a whole lot keeping me here.
you know, if, um...
if you remember how to fix glass...
what about carpentry?
measure twice, cut one，sure.
it's not much, but maybe
you could help me finish my garage.
um, well, that's very generous,
but I don't think it'll cover my rent.
there's plumbing and a fridge,
and you could live there while you do the work.
you know, just until you...
figure out your next move.
maybe I found something to keep me here.
sorry I'm late. I just had to go over some things with Sam.
he's decided to stay in town.
Oh, really? wh-what's he gonna do?
um, you know, this, that,
just until he gets back on his feet.
so that's great, but...
why are you trying to keep our son here?
um, because I wanna help, and because he's...
he's not your responsibility， we're his parents.
you have no right to tell him what to do.
I didn't. I just made him an offer.
to be your live-in handyman?
that's...you know what? I understand how hard this is.
don't stand there and tell us you understand
when you can't possibly.
he needs to be in familiar surroundings
with people who'll love him and embrace him
no matter how much of his memory he recovers.
I want the same thing for him that you do.
I just think he should be able to decide how to find it.
thank you for your professional opinion.
he's coming home with us.
all right, Sam.
let's see what you got.
Great， that's what I remember.
Grandview...paramedic Jim Clancy was shot and killed last night.
clancy is survived by his wife...
Melinda Gordon.
am I too early?
no, not at all.
let me just go open up the garage for you.
would you mind if I had a little coffee first?
Sure，uh, milk, no sugar?
black's fine.
Thanks.
Melinda, look, um...
everybody's walking on eggshells around me,
and I can't blame them, but...
I really need some honesty right now.
are you asking me a question?
you hired me to do the remodel of your garage, but...
I'm starting to get the weird feeling
that there's a lot more to it.
what is it?
it's just, uh...
that's your husband, right?
you know, you'd think I'd recognize his face.
why would you say that?
well, he must have been around when I started the job.
before he died, I mean.
you know about that?
Yeah. I read about it in the paper.
I'm monopolizing your time.
I'm yammering on and on.
you just lost a husband.
why didn't you tell me?
you had enough on your plate.
you don't?
look, there's something I have to tell you,
and it's not gonna be easy for me or for you, I'm sure.
do you have an open mind?
more like an empty one, but...
do you believe in the afterlife?
heaven or ghosts?
both.
what about stuff like reincarnation?
like respect cows
because they might be your ancestors?
sort of.
my husband just died,
and you just had a brush with death also.
Heh. wait, you're not gonna tell me you think
I'm your husband reincarnated,
because...
you're the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
no.
no, of course not. I...I just, um...
I just thought maybe you'd be able to understand what he went through
since you just kind of died yourself,
and I just need to know he's ok wherever he is.
sorry
whatever.
Ah, your high school yearbook.
Oh, my god. you were such a geek.
you know, Jordan,
you've been playing the remember when game for about an hour now,
and I'm kind of getting the sneaking suspicion
that you're trying to get me to remember
when I said that I'd lend you some money.
Wow.
no, really, I...
Oh, there you are.
where have you been?
I started work again.
Oh. for that woman?
whose name is Melinda, yes.
Oh, listen, sweetheart,
we wanted to talk to you about this.
look, I just wanna do what feels right now.
all of your doctors agree you need to come home.
what I need is for you to stop pressuring me.
I know you mean well...
you're coming home with us now.
we've already bought your ticket.
it's nonrefundable.
good, because I'm not going.
finally, the Sam I know.
but you should go.
excuse me?
look, I need to decide my own future.
I...I know that, and I'm ready for it,
whether I get my past back or not,
but, Jordan, you're barely 20 years old,
and you're acting a lot less.
you're not ready to take care of yourself.
do you have any idea how much you sound just like them?
you know, you told me how much I hated these people.
sorry. no offense.
but...but to me, they seem like they genuinely care about us.
if I can forget why I was so angry at them.
why can't you?
Hello! you lost your memory.
well, maybe you should, too.
Jordan.
Jordan.
no. Sam, wait.
don't you run away, too, please.
what's left of my mind is made up.
you're here early.
Hey, whatever's wrong,
you don't have to hide it from me.
trust me,
it's not anything you wanna hear about.
Melinda, you gotta stop thinking like that.
I'm your friend,
and I love you.
I just...
I couldn't lie anymore...
so I started to tell Sam the truth.
Jim...
he never doubted anything I told him.
but Sam...
you should have seen the look on his face.
it's like I told him I was abducted by aliens.
I'm so sorry.
I know this is probably the worst pain you have ever felt.
what do I do?
you get angry, that's what.
you gotta curse the universe and break some stuff.
breaking stuff, that sounds great.
it's the next stage after denial.
denial?
the stages of grief.
you're just going through what we all went through,
what I went through with Charlie.
some people call it denial.
some call it magical thinking.
whatever it is, it's...it's completely normal.
normal...
but not real.
unfortunately, no.
do you remember Jim's funeral...
when everybody started to dance
and I told you afterwards that Jim had made that happen
and you said you believed it?
you said that you could feel him there, too.
that was different.
that's what you always do.
you talk to ghosts or whatever it is,
and you make people's lives better.
well, how is it different this time?
it's different, because you aren't helping anyone.
you're not helping Sam,
you're not helping his family,
and you are definitely not helping yourself.
the last conscious decision my husband made
was to risk everything just to be with me.
I am not gonna turn my back on that.
that's great.
believe he is out there somewhere.
you are not listening to me, as usual.
as usual?
I know it's bizarre.
all right, it's even hard for me to believe,
but it's what happened.
Jim is not just "out there somewhere.
he's here, in this man's body.
Melinda... - No, he took a chance
out of love and out of loyalty
for the one person who meant everything to him,
even though he knows it doesn't make any sense.
that is what love is,
in case you're unsure.
so there's no middle ground?
I have to check my common sense at the door,
or we can't be friends?
what's wrong?
rough day.
me, too.
you moving in?
what's wrong?
well, look, I been thinking about this.
you've been amazingly supportive.
uh, but it's just weird.
I mean, I don't even know you,
and suddenly I'm moving into your place.
and then what's even weirder is...
I mean, how I feel when we're together.
it's ok.
Ah, is it?
Heh. the point is...
no matter how painful this whole thing has been,
I've been given a second chance,
and I realized that last night when I stood up to my parents and my sister.
OK. So, take your time.
do whatever it is that you need to do to get your memory back.
I don't know if I want to get it back.
look, I don't know if the guy I was
is the kind of guy I wanna be.
what kind of guy is that?
the kind that has an affair with a married woman.
tell him.
you deserve an explanation.
he deserves the truth.
but all I can give you right now
is that I would have never cheated on my husband, ever.
will you tell me what is going on between us?
cause I'm confused,
and whenever I'm around you, I can't think straight.
because I feel so familiar?
that's part of it.
do I feel like a friend?
at least.
that you can trust?
I think so.
then trust me.
I just don't know if can trust myself.
Sam, look...
look, thank you for helping me, ok?
thank you, but I think we're better off...
maybe I just go away, huh?
go?
where?
I guess I know when I get there.
Oh, Melinda.
is she here? where's Sam?
where did you send him?
I don't know. - oh, terrific.
the boy can't remember a damn thing,
and now he's out wandering all alone.
do you really think that's what he needs?
no. actually, I wanted him to stay.
well, what are we supposed to do now?
I have no idea.
but if he ever gives you a second chance,
I hope you don't blow it like you did the first time.
I beg your pardon?
I know what it's like to lose someone
and do not know if it's for good.
I know that impulse to do everything humanly possible just to get them back.
sometimes impulses are wrong.
are you a parent? - No,
and I'm not a doctor either,
but believe me when I say that you have to start preparing yourself for the fact that your son
may never remember who he was.
look, Ms. Gordon...
and you should be grateful for that. you know why?
because you'll actually have a son.
at some point, he's gonna need his family,
and he will call,
but all he's gonna remember is who you are now,
so wouldn't you want that to be a good thing?
what is that supposed to mean, exactly?
you've held on to your children so tight that you've lost them both.
but there's still time to maybe get them back,
but not if you keep making the same mistakes.
Hey. where are you?
at the cafe, doing homework.
Oh. I thought I'd surprise you
and stop by and take you out for something to eat, but you're not here.
where? - At the courts.
isn't your shooting clinic on Mondays?
OK, promise you won't get mad.
well, I promise I will if you don't start talkin'.
mom, there's no shooting clinic on Mondays.
what?
I used to meet Jim there on Mondays to practice,
but I didn't tell you it was just him and me,
because I was afraid if you knew,
you'd make me come and work at the store instead.
Ned, I wish you would have...
mom, please don't be mad.
I'm not mad. I'm ju...
I have to call you back.
Sam?
Hey. Delia, right?
what are you doing here?
Heh. promise not to laugh?
I have no idea.
I was driving out of town.
I was leaving...
and then suddenly I got this feeling
that I was supposed to be somewhere,
somewhere important.
so I just came here.
weird, isn't it? heh.
Yeah. you could say that.
I was hoping someone would recognize me...
they could tell me why I had to be here.
it's really you.
sorry?
I think you could be right.
I think you are supposed to be somewhere.
where?
you tried.
I will never forget that.
if you never forgive me, I will understand,
but I couldn't just sit around and do nothing
when this whole thing was ready to blow away.
what whole thing? what are you talking about?
you and Jim, your future together,
your whole everything.
are you drunk?
no, there is no time to explain, Mel.
he's outside.
who? - Jim.
I mean Sam... Jim...Sam...
whatever the hell his name is.
but I convinced him to come back
and talk to you, but you have to figure out what to do next.
where did you?
he was on the basketball court on the way out of town.
I saw him, I stopped, and I convinced him
to come back and talk to you.
why did you?
because he was waiting for Ned,
and I finally understood.
what?
that I was wrong.
OK? About pretty much everything.
and I know that we are gonna talk about this endlessly in the future,
but right now, you have to go outside
and make sure that Jim does not get back on that road and go out of town.
you keep calling him Jim.
that's who he is, isn't he?
OK, stop, go.
it's ok.
got my best friend back.
OK, quit your blubbering.
you made me blubber.
Oh, wait a sec.
Delia.
there's a stain on it.
you gotta really be presentable.
you got any lip gloss?
no, if it's Jim, I don't need lip gloss.
do you know how lucky you are?
you are gonna get a second shot at your one true love.
OK. go.
go, go, go.
OK.
you're back.
I apologize for before.
I got a little overdramatic.
it's ok. I don't...
I mean, if I'm on some search to find out
what feels right in my life, you know,
what places and what people,
you know, I should take baby steps.
I should start at square one and not square 10.
and if that does...
you know what? Whatever your reasons are,
I'm fine with it.
you don't need to explain anything.
maybe that's best for now, for both of us.
OK.
OK.
can I move this stuff into your garage?
Yeah. I'll help you.
Thanks.
Hey, you guys need some help?
sure. - Sure.
did I mention my, uh...
my parents called my sister
and apologized for a lifetime of controlling behavior?
and then Jordan just got up and went back home with them.
I had no idea.
Oh, yeah? because when I asked them why the big change of heart,
they said that they had talked to you
and that you had talked sense to them.
how'd you do that?
I have a few talents.
a few talents?
that's what you're gonna leave me with?
OK.
no explanations.
I'll be right there.
Hey, Sam, why don't you, uh...
show me what you're planning to do with the space in here?
love to, if I can remember.
I know what you're thinking.
it's a good thing you didn't listen to me.
I beg your pardon?
if there's one thing I thought being dead would make me an expert on, it was being dead,
but I was wrong.
that's your specialty, like you said.
I've been at it a while.
I wanted them to have the closure,
but you held out for more.
you gave them their family back.
are you ready?
to go into the light?
it's been following me around all day.
but there is one thing I wanted to say to you before I went in.
what?
what your husband did might just be a miracle.
I hope it is,
because after a lifetime of this,
a miracle's what you deserve.
Hey, uh, you ok?
Yeah.
Mr. Seifert! Talk to me! When did you swallow it?
Mr. Seifert! Won't you tell me?
open your eyes!
you have to cooperate. Can you hear me?
bend your head forward.
open your eyes now!
bend your head forward. Now open wide for me please.
you have to swallow this now.
swallow! Don't fight it. Swallow please. Come on.
open your mouth wider please.
swallow. That's good. Well done.
don't fight it. Swallow it.
don't fight it. Swallow.
don't forget to breathe.
now it will be a little unpleasant.
your head to one side.
don't forget to breathe. That's right.
breathe in. You're doing fine. Don't spit it out.
swallow it.
turn your head to one side.
that's okay. We can drain the rest.
don't fall asleep.
lt'll soon be over.
almost finished.
this will be unpleasant.
keep calm.
what made you do that?
what made you do it?
won't you tell me?
lt's because...
what?
l'm queer.
a homosexual.
Mathias, don't cry. That's nothing to cry about.
my name is Philipp Klahrmann.
l'm your new homeroom teacher.
shit.
sorry.
we need some water.
l hope it's not broken.
can you wet this for me? -Sure.
that's too wet. -Sorry.
l'm so embarrassed.
l'll be okay.
okay. Let's get a drink now. -No.
lt's crazy. -What?
glad l bumped into you. l didn't mean it like that.
let's go. l look awful. -You look fine.
two " fool's proof " .
like it? -Great.
we'll take 2 more.
what's it called? - " Fool's proof " .
l never go out.
hang on.
of course he's from the opticians where we met for the first time.
you stepped on my contact lens.
l think that he has the appearance of an Asian trader somehow.
stick to mineral water my love if you can't take the hard stuff.
l think the glasses suit you better.
they make you so manly and imposing.
Really? -Yes.
now it's party time.
l got rid of it all.
thank God for that.
l'd better be going. -No, stay a while.
how about tea? -Fine.
take off your coat.
Thanks.
l was going to make tea. l enjoyed the evening.
sorry l got a bit... you know...
we never socialized. -That's not true.
when? -A college dance in 1982.
we even danced together.
what? -l was a year above you.
you danced with Britta all the time. -l don't remember that.
don't remember! We all knew that you both...
what? -You had a thing going.
l did not. l hardly knew her.
all of us liked you.
did you paint those?
they're real good. -Thanks.
you're really talented.
you could turn professional. l'm sure.
what about the tea? -l still like you a lot.
ln films they throw them away.
romy Schneider, for example. l think that's great.
you ruined me.
l don't know what you did to me.
why did you go out with me?
no-one asks me out.
would you want me?
l mean...
as your husband?
l won't be offended if...
but l thought...
my God!
my God.
essay subject.
what moves me when l read this poem?
what do l move after reading it?
which suggestions do l make?
I need no gravestone.
if you need one for me
I want the following inscription:
he made suggestions.
we accepted them.
we are all honored by that inscription.
fucking nigger!
stop it you bastards!
bastards. Leave him alone!
bastards! Get away from him!
l'm disappointed.
really disappointed.
you're usually a bright bunch.
all l get from you is this boring, tired, innocuous junk.
l was expecting a lot more.
l thought we could get to know a lot more about each other.
what you really think.
get to know your goals in life. Hear about your desires, joys, doubts.
and your fears.
l don't want the right answers.
what you think l want to hear.
because the teacher decides what's said or thought.
no anger in you?
no need to make an effort?
how are you going to improve things in the future?
fight stupidity if you don't see it?
want to visit my mom? -No, Redford's coming.
l'll go. Won't take long.
who's coming? -Redford.
to look you over.
see if l'm good enough?
he was my neighbor. A good looker.
so his name's Redford? -Right.
jealous? -You bet l am.
l'll hurry. Behave yourself.
you wanted to see your mom.
about time you came.
l brought flowers.
no chrysanthemums, l hope. -No, l brought you gerberas.
you brought mums before. You know l'm allergic to them.
we have a hell of a lot of work.
you could help out a bit.
by washing clothes... shopping...
your sister must study.
she can't help out. Your father's away lecturing. And me?
l'm busy also. l have to work.
l don't know what to think.
you used to be different.
l was a kid. l lived here then.
just a bunch of excuses.
my life would have been different without you kids around.
so what?
who's that?
that's her. -Who?
my girlfriend. -You have a girlfriend?
since when?
a few weeks.
well, then...
bring her over.
l'm speechless.
going to marry her?
we must talk about it sometime then.
can you wash the dishes?
do the laundry...
well l never.
Yes, Mom.
you know each other?
yes... we once...
as class mates.
great to see you. We must meet more often.
visit me. Tanja knows my address.
maybe.
l guess you didn't get my letters? lt must be 2 or 3 years now.
never mind. So long.
what's wrong?
you were so rude.
almost winter again.
sometimes it helps to look at the sky.
the job's not easy.
not for anyone.
not only the kids make life hard.
lt's the gossipy colleagues too.
get too chummy.
you need more backbone.
lt's important.
you'll make out. l'm sure of that.
l'm there if you need me. -Thank you.
let us greet a new guest.
two minutes past midnight.
don't be shy.
come closer, young man. l don't bite. Larry dear...
find our new guest a seat, will you.
wait.
there's a seat at the bar honey.
l just came in for cigarettes.
don't be scared.
everyone is at first.
be brave.
would you like a drink?
you're too late. Larry's treating him.
don't be shy. Larry's okay.
my teeth are killing me.
l work all day on the new house.
hartmut doesn't help, the lazy cow. And the concrete. lt ruins my hands.
l wore my first evening gown when l was 15 years old.
l found it in a trunk in my great aunt's attic.
l put it on and went into the parlor. l admired myself in the mirror.
my aunt came in. She was a farmer.
she wore men's clothes. l didn't know she was a lesbian.
she entered and asked what l was wearing.
l replied: An evening gown.
she came to me and said: Nature's been fooling around with us.
you should be a girl. l should be a man.
there are no women any more.
the women say there are no men any more.
but l tell you one thing for sure. There are no women any more.
those 2 guys over there are teachers.
gorgeous boys.
a child psychologist and a crane operator.
don't drink so much, honey.
what do you all want from me? l have nothing to do with...
he meant l have nothing to do with you!
the heck there aren't any women. There aren't any women any more.
there you are!
you know...
l was so worried.
l was going crazy.
where were you?
see you later.
good evening. ls Mr. Schrader in?
Jakob, a visitor.
well! What a surprise!
Hi! -Come on in.
we just made some grog. Have a glass with us.
l just wanted... -Give me your coat.
have a seat. -Thanks.
ls Tanja okay? -Yeah, she's fine.
she doesn't know l'm here. l looked for you in the phone book.
we went to school together.
he lives with Tanja.
did you tell Tanja anything? -About what?
about the past.
did you tell her about us?
you know what l mean. -So that's why you came.
you haven't changed at all. A pity.
you're still as ashamed.
no, Jakob. l just...
that's just it. Since l saw you again...
everything's different.
lt's not real. -Not real? Not real?
stay here. We have no secrets. We live together.
we're proud of it. Understand?
please... -You don't mean it?
you never meant it, right? You didn't abandon me?
you didn't change schools because you hated the sight of me?
you didn't send your parents and accuse me of seducing you?
now you're telling me you didn't know?
your parents bought me a bicycle and gave me a compass.
to make up for having to do without you.
we were a large family.
and had little money.
Hey, fag!
look at him! Hi, sweetie!
let's get out of here.
a song from the ghetto.
my mother does not caII me by my name.
my mother is dead.
my father does not caII me by my name.
my father is far away.
God does not call me by my name.
l had a totally wrong impression of Lutz.
shyer and less mature.
he's great.
this is my stop. -You're braving awful weather.
just for me. -No, for us.
lt was your only birthday wish.
l have another wish. -What?
that you tell me when something's bothering you.
l mean if you have problems because of me.
l was so afraid.
l flipped my lid. l went completely nuts.
Why?
l don't know either.
excuse me?
when did the line start? -Yesterday morning.
l got here late too.
fancy meeting you here. Funny.
are you sure you know me? Aren't you mistaken?
you're Philipp.
Oh... Now l remember.
my God!
l came to around noon. l don't remember much.
this is the concert service.
pIease get in line.
the numbers wiII now be distributed.
they can be exchanged for tickets starting at 9 o'clock.
barenboim and Celibidache impressed me.
abbado was also quite good.
l couldn't get tickets for Bernstein.
back in 1984 l saw him at the gala premiere.
lt was simply out of this world.
let's go.
what a goddamn mess. Everything's dirty.
these sluts! lt's the same pigpen every morning.
really! lt's enough to drive you crazy.
just look at the state it's in. lt's absolutely filthy.
l'll kill those bitches. What a dump.
we're glad the dump is open. -Sit at the counter.
l can't be running a marathon on Saturday before breakfast.
he's a good looker, isn't he?
he loved going to rock concerts.
l don't understand you kids liking religious stuff.
lt's been 12, no 13 years now since he crashed his bike into a truck.
he was my only son.
that's life.
he was only 19. How old are you? -l'm 20. Almost.
so?
what now?
l have to go.
lt's a pity.
Thanks. For everything.
tough luck.
what did you think of me? -Why?
l was so drunk.
l was thinking of myself.
lt's like that when you find out what you are.
you hang out in bars and drink just to drown all your problems.
l'm giving a birthday party tonight in that bar.
try to come. -That's why we drank champagne.
l can't come.
lt's impossible. Sorry.
come later if you like.
no... l can't possibly come.
you'll come. l know you will.
shall we take in a late movie?
not tonight.
l have a hard day ahead of me. Are you disappointed?
no.
you're so jumpy.
l just felt like it somehow.
let's drink some grog and go to bed.
you can read to me. How about it?
okay. Let's do that.
I cIicked my heeIs together sharply. It brought the tears to my eyes.
pIease don't be sad. I need to be alone for a whiIe.
don't worry about me or try to contact me. Philipp.
that's him! Philipp!
this is my mom and dad.
my sister Sonja. Her friend Carsten.
my cousin Ulrike. Holger, Sebastian, Alex and Erika.
you met Walter already.
you all waited for me?
lncredible.
l always wanted to live so high up.
don't your folks mind the fact that you came back to my place?
why should they? lt's perfectly okay.
look, a train.
like a toy.
what's with you?
you're so quiet all of a sudden.
you are Mathias.
l believe l've waited for you.
at least for the past 2 years.
how do you know?
do you have a lover? -No.
honest? -Sure.
maybe you do now.
me.
maybe it isn't such a good idea. -You have a lover after all?
rubbish.
don't you want a family? To have kids some day?
no. l don't want any of that.
l know l can't have it anyway.
did you know my grandma wrote poems?
they were very erotic poems.
swallows fIew around the loving couple.
she sighed: Come to me, BeIoved.
TousIe my hair.
rip off my panties and be my ruination.
do you know the feeling when you're going to bed?
the feeling that maybe someone might ring your bell.
but nobody comes?
l'm talking nonsense.
but yesterday.
out in the cold. For the first time in my life.
l noticed l'd found someone.
someone's hand to hold and make me warm inside.
then you're not alone.
maybe.
maybe it's possible.
l think you're incredible.
l never slept with another man before.
can l come again?
you look awful.
go see a doctor. -There are enough people off sick.
problems? -Nope.
Tanja shows it more.
you might think she's pregnant.
what?
one might think so. That's all.
you wouldn't be overjoyed, l guess.
has Tanja said anything to you? -Not exactly, but...
when a woman gets dizzy spells.
and gets morning sickness.
you say it's all okay.
l hope it's true.
l have no choice. You can leave.
l won't leave you. Never.
maybe it's my fault you wanted a new girlfriend.
l want you. lt won't happen again...
man. l love you.
hell and Damnation. l'm just being a stupid cow. Shit.
so sorry.
at long last.
why are you never home?
l thought something happened.
how are you doing?
your drink.
this was my last hope.
l looked all over for you.
l knew you'd be here tonight.
l have so much to tell you.
the champagne.
Yes, l... -What?
this is Mathias.
this is my wife, Tanja.
Yes, this is Tanja. My wife.
Oh, l see.
l see.
l wasn't hiding it from you.
not on purpose.
so that's what's up.
l didn't even notice.
let me explain.
lt's idiotic.
l know you...
go on!
know my next birthday wish?
for you to get out of here. Don't touch me!
do you know the time? lt is 9. 40 now.
your class started at 7. 50. Come and see me after school.
mignon.
stop talking at once!
lt's unfair to him.
time to go home, darlings.
time is up. The hardship cases must go too.
l'll go now. -Finish your beer first.
l'm not a civil servant.
have you seen Mathias around? The guy l was in here with...
do you know his address? -Know how many Mathias come here?
ask me another one.
sorry. -Mathias?
Mathias? The charming dentist? He's very generous.
l think he lives in Grunau. -No, he moved last August.
l didn't mean him.
you mean the young guy who celebrated his birthday.
he's never been back.
someone must know his name and where he lives.
nobody knows anybody's name or his address here.
everyone is alone here.
everyone is afraid.
Hi, Philipp. -Mom?
lf you won't come，l can't sleep at night.
don't look at me like that.
Why?
why must it be? -What?
l mean...
the way you are. -There's no other way.
why do l have to justify myself?
Why?
ls it better to pretend?
lie to oneself? Aim for a goal one can never reach?
make others unhappy for lack of an alternative?
because nature made me this way?
who am l harming?
my so-called reputation?
don't we all have a right to live as nature intended?
no, please. -Tell me how can l help you?
by not crying.
as a child l often cried for you.
when you and dad fought.
that did no good at all.
l just wanted you to be happy.
unhappy?
l'm unhappy because of you.
that's the only reason.
feel like it?
here? Or your place? -Not here.
that was fun.
see you.
ls everything okay?
okay?
ls your wife out of town? Taking a night off?
come on, Lutz.
Philipp, meet Lutz.
come on in. Welcome!
join the fun! The more the merrier!
it's your birthday today.
so I toId myself
I'd dedicate this song to you...
get your hands off me dirty old man!
that's not the way we behave around here.
lt was a misunderstanding.
didn't you hear me? A misunderstanding.
sit down over here.
l don't allow aggression in here. -l know.
bring us a drink. Two brandies.
l'm not serving him. Just one.
bring two. l'll drink both.
right. Two large brandies coming up.
you think we always make a pass at every man we approach?
just because we're gay?
can't we just be trying to help?
and be kind like other people?
two large brandies for you. -The same again.
l'm not saying anything.
better bring a whole tray.
stop crying.
leave me alone. Just leave me alone, will you?
l'm afraid.
l'm terrified.
l'm a high school teacher.
know what that means? A queer high school teacher.
lt could be worse.
l'm not saying another word.
we can turn people away who get drunk.
lt could happen to you. So be careful.
l don't mind you insulting me.
but l can't take brutality.
l've taken too much.
l already paid my price to be able to sit here and wait.
wait like everyone else here.
for a man to smile.
honest, tender and loving.
lt is so easy nowadays in this society.
once...
once l met the love of my life.
fifty years back.
his name was Karl.
l was twenty. He was twenty-eight.
we had worked out a good way to conceal it.
one night...
l don't know who reported us.
we were dragged out of our tent, disciplined and taken away.
they took us to Gestapo HQ in Berlin.
we were imprisoned.
Karl and l.
ln isolation cells. Solitary confinement.
they sent me to a concentration camp.
Sachsenhausen.
l wore a pink triangle. l was dirt to them.
then l became a member of the Communist Party.
the comrades saved me.
l was an activist from the first hour after the war.
we worked like crazy.
now it does not matter if the person you work with is a Jew or whatever.
except gays.
they were forgotten somehow.
l am so sorry, Mr. Klahrman.
certain events which we must discuss later on force us to carry out an inspection of your work.
we shall begin now.
go ahead.
please sit elsewhere.
Yes.
Mr. Seifert! Talk to me! When did you swallow it?
Mr. Seifert! Won't you tell me?
open your eyes!
you have to cooperate. Can you hear me?
bend your head forward.
open your eyes now!
bend your head forward. Now open wide for me please.
you have to swallow this now.
swallow! Don't fight it. Swallow please. Come on.
open your mouth wider please.
swallow. That's good. Well done.
don't fight it. Swallow it.
don't fight it. Swallow.
don't forget to breathe.
now it will be a little unpleasant.
your head to one side.
don't forget to breathe. That's right.
breathe in. You're doing fine. Don't spit it out.
swallow it.
turn your head to one side.
that's okay. We can drain the rest.
don't fall asleep.
lt'll soon be over.
almost finished.
this will be unpleasant.
keep calm.
what made you do that?
what made you do it?
won't you tell me?
lt's because...
what?
l'm queer.
a homosexual.
Mathias, don't cry. That's nothing to cry about.
my name is Philipp Klahrmann.
l'm your new homeroom teacher.
shit.
sorry.
we need some water.
l hope it's not broken.
can you wet this for me? -Sure.
that's too wet. -Sorry.
l'm so embarrassed.
l'll be okay.
okay. Let's get a drink now. -No.
lt's crazy. -What?
glad l bumped into you. l didn't mean it like that.
let's go. l look awful. -You look fine.
two " fool's proof " .
like it? -Great.
we'll take 2 more.
what's it called? - " Fool's proof " .
l never go out.
hang on.
of course he's from the opticians where we met for the first time.
you stepped on my contact lens.
l think that he has the appearance of an Asian trader somehow.
stick to mineral water my love if you can't take the hard stuff.
l think the glasses suit you better.
they make you so manly and imposing.
Really? -Yes.
now it's party time.
l got rid of it all.
thank God for that.
l'd better be going. -No, stay a while.
how about tea? -Fine.
take off your coat.
Thanks.
l was going to make tea. l enjoyed the evening.
sorry l got a bit... you know...
we never socialized. -That's not true.
when? -A college dance in 1982.
we even danced together.
what? -l was a year above you.
you danced with Britta all the time. -l don't remember that.
don't remember! We all knew that you both...
what? -You had a thing going.
l did not. l hardly knew her.
all of us liked you.
did you paint those?
they're real good. -Thanks.
you're really talented.
you could turn professional. l'm sure.
what about the tea? -l still like you a lot.
ln films they throw them away.
romy Schneider, for example. l think that's great.
you ruined me.
l don't know what you did to me.
why did you go out with me?
no-one asks me out.
would you want me?
l mean...
as your husband?
l won't be offended if...
but l thought...
my God!
my God.
essay subject.
what moves me when l read this poem?
what do l move after reading it?
which suggestions do l make?
I need no gravestone.
if you need one for me
I want the following inscription:
he made suggestions.
we accepted them.
we are all honored by that inscription.
fucking nigger!
stop it you bastards!
bastards. Leave him alone!
bastards! Get away from him!
l'm disappointed.
really disappointed.
you're usually a bright bunch.
all l get from you is this boring, tired, innocuous junk.
l was expecting a lot more.
l thought we could get to know a lot more about each other.
what you really think.
get to know your goals in life. Hear about your desires, joys, doubts.
and your fears.
l don't want the right answers.
what you think l want to hear.
because the teacher decides what's said or thought.
no anger in you?
no need to make an effort?
how are you going to improve things in the future?
fight stupidity if you don't see it?
want to visit my mom? -No, Redford's coming.
l'll go. Won't take long.
who's coming? -Redford.
to look you over.
see if l'm good enough?
he was my neighbor. A good looker.
so his name's Redford? -Right.
jealous? -You bet l am.
l'll hurry. Behave yourself.
you wanted to see your mom.
about time you came.
l brought flowers.
no chrysanthemums, l hope. -No, l brought you gerberas.
you brought mums before. You know l'm allergic to them.
we have a hell of a lot of work.
you could help out a bit.
by washing clothes... shopping...
your sister must study.
she can't help out. Your father's away lecturing. And me?
l'm busy also. l have to work.
l don't know what to think.
you used to be different.
l was a kid. l lived here then.
just a bunch of excuses.
my life would have been different without you kids around.
so what?
who's that?
that's her. -Who?
my girlfriend. -You have a girlfriend?
since when?
a few weeks.
well, then...
bring her over.
l'm speechless.
going to marry her?
we must talk about it sometime then.
can you wash the dishes?
do the laundry...
well l never.
Yes, Mom.
you know each other?
yes... we once...
as class mates.
great to see you. We must meet more often.
visit me. Tanja knows my address.
maybe.
l guess you didn't get my letters? lt must be 2 or 3 years now.
never mind. So long.
what's wrong?
you were so rude.
almost winter again.
sometimes it helps to look at the sky.
the job's not easy.
not for anyone.
not only the kids make life hard.
lt's the gossipy colleagues too.
get too chummy.
you need more backbone.
lt's important.
you'll make out. l'm sure of that.
l'm there if you need me. -Thank you.
let us greet a new guest.
two minutes past midnight.
don't be shy.
come closer, young man. l don't bite. Larry dear...
find our new guest a seat, will you.
wait.
there's a seat at the bar honey.
l just came in for cigarettes.
don't be scared.
everyone is at first.
be brave.
would you like a drink?
you're too late. Larry's treating him.
don't be shy. Larry's okay.
my teeth are killing me.
l work all day on the new house.
hartmut doesn't help, the lazy cow. And the concrete. lt ruins my hands.
l wore my first evening gown when l was 15 years old.
l found it in a trunk in my great aunt's attic.
l put it on and went into the parlor. l admired myself in the mirror.

l wasn't hiding it from you.
not on purpose.
so that's what's up.
l didn't even notice.
let me explain.
lt's idiotic.
l know you...
go on!
know my next birthday wish?
for you to get out of here. Don't touch me!
do you know the time? lt is 9. 40 now.
your class started at 7. 50. Come and see me after school.
mignon.
stop talking at once!
lt's unfair to him.
time to go home, darlings.
time is up. The hardship cases must go too.
l'll go now. -Finish your beer first.
l'm not a civil servant.
have you seen Mathias around? The guy l was in here with...
do you know his address? -Know how many Mathias come here?
ask me another one.
sorry. -Mathias?
Mathias? The charming dentist? He's very generous.
l think he lives in Grunau. -No, he moved last August.
l didn't mean him.
you mean the young guy who celebrated his birthday.
he's never been back.
someone must know his name and where he lives.
nobody knows anybody's name or his address here.
everyone is alone here.
everyone is afraid.
Hi, Philipp. -Mom?
lf you won't come，l can't sleep at night.
don't look at me like that.
Why?
why must it be? -What?
l mean...
the way you are. -There's no other way.
why do l have to justify myself?
Why?
ls it better to pretend?
lie to oneself? Aim for a goal one can never reach?
make others unhappy for lack of an alternative?
because nature made me this way?
who am l harming?
my so-called reputation?
don't we all have a right to live as nature intended?
no, please. -Tell me how can l help you?
by not crying.
as a child l often cried for you.
when you and Dad fought.
that did no good at all.
l just wanted you to be happy.
unhappy?
l'm unhappy because of you.
that's the only reason.
feel like it?
here? Or your place? -Not here.
that was fun.
see you.
ls everything okay?
okay?
ls your wife out of town? Taking a night off?
come on, Lutz.
Philipp, meet Lutz.
come on in. Welcome!
join the fun! The more the merrier!
it's your birthday today.
so I toId myself
I'd dedicate this song to you...
get your hands off me dirty old man!
that's not the way we behave around here.
lt was a misunderstanding.
didn't you hear me? A misunderstanding.
sit down over here.
l don't allow aggression in here. -l know.
bring us a drink. Two brandies.
l'm not serving him. Just one.
bring two. l'll drink both.
right. Two large brandies coming up.
you think we always make a pass at every man we approach?
just because we're gay?
can't we just be trying to help?
and be kind like other people?
two large brandies for you. -The same again.
l'm not saying anything.
better bring a whole tray.
stop crying.
leave me alone. Just leave me alone, will you?
l'm afraid.
l'm terrified.
l'm a high school teacher.
know what that means? A queer high school teacher.
lt could be worse.
l'm not saying another word.
we can turn people away who get drunk.
lt could happen to you. So be careful.
l don't mind you insulting me.
but l can't take brutality.
l've taken too much.
l already paid my price to be able to sit here and wait.
wait like everyone else here.
for a man to smile.
honest, tender and loving.
lt is so easy nowadays in this society.
once...
once l met the love of my life.
fifty years back.
his name was Karl.
l was twenty. He was twenty-eight.
we had worked out a good way to conceal it.
one night...
l don't know who reported us.
we were dragged out of our tent, disciplined and taken away.
they took us to Gestapo HQ in Berlin.
we were imprisoned.
Karl and l.
ln isolation cells. Solitary confinement.
they sent me to a concentration camp.
Sachsenhausen.
l wore a pink triangle. l was dirt to them.
then l became a member of the Communist Party.
the comrades saved me.
l was an activist from the first hour after the war.
we worked like crazy.
now it does not matter if the person you work with is a Jew or whatever.
except gays.
they were forgotten somehow.
l am so sorry, Mr. Klahrmann.
certain events which we must discuss later on force us to carry out an inspection of your work.
we shall begin now.
go ahead.
please sit elsewhere.
Yes.
Oh, God.
well, what the hell happened?
we're an old married couple. - Mmm-hmm.
was it the pot?
I don't think so, because we brought it with us from New York.
Yeah. - It's the same.
what was that...
what was that old movie?
you know, Blame it on Rio.
it has to be that, it has to be that.
you got to feel my heart.
are you going to make it till dinner time?
after dinner time.
Oh, God.
God, I'd love to live like this.
Yeah.
I'm willing, if you have enough money to stay in Brazil for the rest of our lives.
I'll think about it.
okay.
do you think that's it, being away?
Yeah. - Yeah.
Hey, babe.
where did you go?
don't do this to yourself.
everything is wonderful.
everything is wonderful.
Yeah.
good luck. See you in a bit.
I love you.
okay.
don't touch anything. Don't say anything. Back up.
turn off the lights. Turn them off.
are you... Don't even think about the buzzer.
get in the corner.
is the cash in here? Open it up. Open it up!
quicker. Get over here. Get over here. You want me to fucking shoot you?
open it up. Open it up.
get over in the corner. Get over in the corner. Keep your hands down.
keep your fucking hands down.
all right?
come over here. Get over here so I can see you.
come over here. Stand at the corner. Come over here.
put your hands down. Put your hands down.
Oh, shit! Is this all you got in here?
I'm watching... Stay away from the fucking buzzer, all right.
fucking shit, it's all she... Get back in your corner.
get back in your fucking... Get back in your corner!
all right, keep your hands down by your side, all right. I'm watching you.
I will shoot you, all right. I'll fucking shoot you in a second.
this is all shit.
diamonds.
Where's the fucking keys for this case?
Where's the... Where are the keys for this case?
in the drawer. - Shut up, all right.
these are them? Don't fucking move, all right.
don't move.
what, are they all the same?
are they?
fucking stupid bitch.
I'm watching you.
which fucking key... Which fucking... This is bullshit!
what the fuck is up...
what type of glass is this...
fuck is up with this glass?
fuck this...
bullshit.
fuck this...
fuck, no.
fuck you, you mother fucking stupid fuck.
fuck.
my gun.
fuck! Andy!
Hank, you're so stupid!
fucking Andy!
shit.
Hey, two for four. You're batting. 500.
no, Dad, the second one was an air...
no, no. It was a perfectly placed bunt. - Good game, sweetheart.
good game. How many you got?
Yeah, who's going to want seconds?
uncle Andy, can I have another hot dog?
Yeah, the way you played today, I'll buy you the whole stand.
no, her mother doesn't want her eating junk, all right?
that's not junk, that's all right. That's a hot dog, right, honey?
what do I owe you?
Hey, Hank, your money is no good here.
no, I got it, okay.
I got it. - You sure?
that was a good game. - Yeah.
Hey, give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.
all right. I'll see you next weekend? - I love you.
all right, be good. Here's your ball.
you didn't feed her junk, did you? - No, of course not.
I don't want her to develop bad eating habits.
she looks puffy. - She doesn't look puffy, all right.
you look puffy. - Fuck you.
she wore sun block? - It was cloudy, Martha.
there are rays, Hank. Hey, you got my money?
Oh, Christ, Martha. Do you have any idea what that school is costing me?
you're the one who wanted to send her there.
Yeah, because it is a damn good school and she wanted to go there.
you owe me three months. - I don't owe you.
I owe Danielle. - Don't get semantic.
Bye. - April, May and June.
no, I promise, all right.
what's up, Hank?
piece of shit!
fuck you. All right. Can I borrow your cell phone?
I don't have one.
just... - It's brain cancer. There's a pay phone - Over there by the bathroom. - No, it can wait.
what's happening with you?
I used to think you had the world by the balls.
now, I'm not sure if you even got any.
I got them when I need them, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, smart and funny.
what I always admired about you, your wit.
you're a prick, Andy. - I always was.
so, let's see if there're any left. - What?
well, you need money. So do I. Let's solve it.
what are you talking about? - Well, there's a place we can knock off.
know it like the back of our hand. Easiest money you'll ever get.
what are you saying?
it's worth about 600 grand.
and it's insured, so it's a victimless crime.
I offer that in case your faggoty little conscience bothers you.
I weigh it off on 20 cents on the dollar.
that's 60 grand each.
give or take.
I can't believe this is you that's talking.
believe it.
so, it's safe, nobody gets hurt, everybody wins. It's perfect.
Why?
what do...
do you need money? - Of course, I need money. But this is...
this is serious crime, Andy. I'm not a serious crime kind of a guy. I got a kid...
you've got shit.
you have a whole lot of shit. You said so yourself.
all the time. Every day.
you know what? It's not as serious as you might think.
you're my little brother. Now, trust me.
God, Andy.
that's why you called me up?
that's why you wanted to spend the night together, - Talk me into something crazy? - That's why I called you up.
talk you into something crazy.
well, what's the place?
no, not another word till you commit.
fuck.
it's all right.
so, how's the wife?
Hey, Hank.
Hey, I got an appointment.
I'll be back in a few, all right. - Of course, you will. It's Thursday.
you're early. - Well...
you know my days are so busy.
just tell me that you'll think about it.
but I thought about it already. And I came to the conclusion that you're crazy.
I'm going to go where with you?
I mean, you've got child support.
you've got Danielle's school, you've got the rent...
the mortgage... - Come on.
...you're up to your ears in debt, Hank. - I can solve all that. I know I can.
when are you going to grow up, Hank?
we have a really good thing going, and you should just enjoy it.
we have a really good time in bed. I don't ask for anything.
I love you. I want more.
so does Oliver Twist.
can I help you to seconds?
or do you really, really, really have to get back?
huh?
the weight of this sad time we must obey.
speak what we feel and not what we ought to say.
the oldest hath borne most.
we that are young shall never see so much, nor live so long.
Bravo! Bravo!
you were great. I'm so proud of you.
you were wonderful.
grandpa and I thought you were wonderful.
excuse me, I'm sorry. It's just... I have to have your autograph.
dad. No. - What, you were incredible.
no, stop it. - What?
I messed up some of my lines. - No, you didn't. I didn't notice.
did you notice? - I didn't notice at all.
honey, you were great. What?
mom, can I go see The Lion King this weekend?
there's a class trip, everyone's going. - Did you ask your father?
can I, Dad? - Yeah, sure. I got some money.
well, it's $130.
but we're staying overnight and that includes hotel and everything.
okay, great. Yeah.
Yeah. - Hey, man. Can I talk to you?
where are you? - I'm down the hall, by the coffee.
how about my office, 30 seconds? - All right.
Hank, the super at 111 Riverside says the boiler's really kaput.
he needs you to... Hello?
so?
that place that you were talking about. - What place?
the one that we were going to... - To knock off?
Yeah.
to rob?
you say it.
tell me about it.
I'm not going to tell you about it until you say you're in and once you say it, there's no way out.
I'm in.
let me see your hands.
just say it again, "I'm in. " - What're you talking about?
just say it again, I'm in.
I'm in.
what?
I just wanted to see if you were pulling any of that chickenshit baby stuff like when we were kids, you know, "It doesn't count. I had my fingers crossed."
I'm in. What're we doing?
and when? - It's a jewelry store.
does this ring a bell? - No.
what if I tell you it's got a Foot Locker on one side and a Claire's Accessories on the other.
Yeah, that's right. You got it. Now, listen.
we don't want Tiffany's. We want a Mom and Pop operation, in a busy place, on a Saturday when the week's takes go in the safe.
we both worked there. We know the safe combinations.
we know the burglar alarm signals. We know where everything is.
I figure, between the week's take, the jewelry and the cases, the vault, there's a $500, 000 haul.
I figure probably six.
that old dumb old lady that works there, she's alone till noon.
she's not going to be a problem.
Andy.
yeah?
that's Mom and Dad's store.
that's what I said.
a Mom and Pop operation.
you can't do that. - Yeah, we can. Think about it.
it's perfect. It's perfect.
in and out in a minute.
insurance takes care of Mom and Dad, so they're not hurt. Right?
no one's going to give a shit. After a week the cops - will put it in the back of the filing cabinet. - Jesus, Andy. I...
why did you even want me in on this?
well, it'll solve everything for both of us.
what has to be solved for you?
same as you. I need money. I'm going to start over again.
what do you mean?
what the fuck kind of... It's none of your business.
I just want out. I just want to... That's all.
I'm getting out, I want to help my little brother.
come on.
Yeah.
no, I don't think I can do this. I don't think I can...
Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can.
I just...
that's $2, 000.
it's an advance.
see what just that much does for you.
and, imagine the rest.
five, six, seven, eight, nine hundred dollars.
you still owe me May and June.
Yeah, Monday. All right. Everything on Monday.
that's what I said. - Such a loser.
you're such a fucking loser.
I come over here with $900.
Yeah, well, if it was for me, maybe. - And I'm the fucking... All right.
may and June, asshole. - Bye, bye, bye.
Danielle, dinner.
no, please don't put me on... Jesus.
yo, Bobby. - What's going on?
Hey, here, let me buy you a drink. - I'm working.
I ain't loaning you no more money. - No, come on, man. I'm flush.
you don't exactly... - Yeah, something like that.
look, you just... If you're free tomorrow morning,
I got a proposition for you.
later. - All right.
what if there is a security guard? - There isn't.
Why? - No, it's a Mom and Pop place.
who ever heard of a Mom and Pop jewelry store?
what the fuck is that? - It's in the suburbs, all right.
it's not in the city.
I don't know.
we drive out there, we check it out, if anything looks off, you know, we just drive away.
we say, "Fuck it," we drive our happy asses home and I keep the money anyway.
Yeah, fine.
you keep the money anyway.
Hanson? - Yeah, that's me.
all right.
Yeah. - Bobby, for Christ's sakes, - Bobby, we got to go. - Just come on in.
I just got to throw on some clothes. It'll only take a second.
we got to go.
just give me a second. - God damn it.
Jesus Christ, Bobby, it's so fucking early.
boo wakes up, you fucking sit up with him.
I told you it was work. - I don't give a fuck what it is.
Chris ain't used to getting up this early.
Oh, Christ.
come on, babe. Here.
thank you, baby. - Yeah, just keep it down, okay?
you wake Boo up, I'll kick your ass.
all right. - Yours, too.
all right.
come on.
all right, let's do it.
are we there? - No.
all right.
who the fuck are you supposed to be?
look, I used to work there, all right. I used to work there and I can't take a chance on being recognized. Don't... Look...
you ain't never done this before, huh? - Yeah, so?
I got to tell you something, you look like a fucking asshole.
Yeah, all right, look... - I'm going to do this on my own.
Really? - You do the driving, I do the thing, all right.
what if you need help? - I got all the help I need.
there's no shooting.
I ain't looking for it. - There's no shooting.
you do the driving. - Hey.
I do the thing. - No shooting.
you ain't got the balls to do the thing. I got the balls - and I got a gun. That's the deal. - Listen, no shooting.
or else I'm leaving right now. - Hey, no!
just no shooting, okay?
okay. Ten more minutes.
what the fuck is this?
you can listen to that faggoty shit all the way home.
right now, I got to get into character.
right? - Okay.
okay.
this is it.
you ready?
car out front. Door open. I jump back in. You take off.
right? - Right.
let's do it. - All right.
Yes, hi, hello. Is Andrew Hanson available, please?
uh...
Mooney. Mooney. Okay, yeah, tell him it's Mooney.
Yeah. - There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.
he sounds like some nut case. - Okay.
but... - All right, I'll take it.
it just came apart, Andy.
Oh, my God, Andy.
what the fuck am I gonna do?
no, honey, no, don't worry. It's just some mistake.
it's either the bank's or mine.
maybe I didn't put enough money in the joint account.
Yeah. No. Listen, don't worry.
of course, we have the cash. I'll call, I'll take care of it. Okay?
Yes, okay?
Andy? - Yeah. Yeah.
we're waiting for you in the conference room.
okay, I'll be right in.
Jesus.
okay, next.
the auditors.
some of you guys might have heard, we're getting hit with an IRS audit.
the auditors will be here on Monday.
they'll spend a day or two with each department.
on Monday, they'll start with payroll, so you're up first, Andy.
great. Great. No problem.
how are you doing today, sir?
thanks a lot.
hungry?
have a drink.
right, tonic water.
you know, the thing about real estate accounting is that you can, you can head down the page or across the page, and everything works out. So, every day, everything adds up.
well, the total is always the sum of its parts.
it's clean, it's clear, neat, absolute.
but my life, it...
it doesn't add up. It's...
nothing connects to anything else. It's...
I'm not the sum of my parts.
all of my parts don't add up to one...
to one me, I guess.
get a shrink or a wife.
I got a wife. - Get a shrink.
excuse me. Sorry.
was it me, honey?
what difference does it make?
it's another strikeout.
I swear it would make a lot of difference.
you're all I want. - Yeah, well...
I'm a lousy cook. The house looks like shit.
I'm a lousy lay, I don't know why you wanna keep me.
you weren't in Rio.
I wasn't what?
lousy lay.
well, like you said, just blame it on Rio.
suppose I could get us back there.
what?
Rio.
to live? - Absolutely.
you're just crazy. Crazy. - No. It's not crazy.
the real estate market's booming in Rio. There's a lot of new money.
and they're going to want the same as Europeans, Arabs, everybody wants real estate in New York, in America and I know the market here.
you don't even speak the language.
I'll fucking learn it. Jesus Christ.
you know when...
when you met me, my biggest prospect was inheriting a Mom and Pop jewelry store in a fucking shopping mall in Westchester.
now, I know it's not Trump Plaza, and...
but just take a look at how we're living now.
now, I took that lousy job in that, that real estate office, I was practically a fucking gofer,
I know the angles.
I bet you do.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
well, because there is no extradition agreement between Brazil and the United States.
how the...
how the hell do you know that?
I saw it in a movie.
Yeah, I guess I saw the same movie.
so, what are you thinking? What are you thinking?
what are you thinking? What are you thinking?
don't ask, don't tell.
I just want us to get back there.
I've seen Heaven, Gina, it's a nice place to stay.
okay? All right? - Uh-huh.
what language do they speak there? - Portuguese.
I speak a little Spanish.
that's... I'm sorry, sweetheart, that's not the same language.
Yes, it is. - I'm sorry, it's not.
Yes, it is. Yes, it is. - No.
Gina.
why'd you come to me?
I know you from way back, I know what you do.
you're a cop.
no, I'm not a cop, I just want to make sure you're still around.
I'll bring you what I've got soon, either you take it or you don't.
but I know you will.
you could work for the cops.
check me out.
I'll be back.
that's $2, 000.
it's an advance.
see what just that much does for you, and imagine the rest.
Yeah, so how do we start? Oh, fuck. - It's not we, you.
me?
what the hell do I know about robbing a jewelry store?
you'll learn it there. On-the-job training, you know.
cut it out, man, this is serious.
you know, I'm serious as a heart attack. Listen, number one, I can't...
I can't go up to the mall. - Why not?
Oh God, three months ago,
I had to walk the whole goddamn area with a Home Depot representative, 'cause they were thinking of buying up a lot of space.
we own a lot of land in the mall, and I'm getting a lot of big handshakes. "Andy, baby, how are you?"
I haven't seen you in so long since you left.
and telling me all that bullshit because they figure I'm making a killing, because a big chain wants to buy them out.
I'm saying someone's going to just recognize me too easy.
so we postpone, just...
Yeah, we could, you know, wait a year.
I mean, I don't know about you, my problems are pressing.
Jesus, Andy, I... Andy!
I wouldn't even know how to start, I mean. - Well, you can stop being a baby.
I'm not being a... - Yeah, you're being a baby.
get a gun. You get a toy gun in a kid's store.
right, that old lady that works on Saturday, what's her name?
Doris? - Yeah, Doris, Mom's friend.
she's what, 60, 70? She's blind as a bat?
look at me. Blind as a bat.
all right, those toy guns, they look so real, they fool cops all the time.
all right, you go in at 8: 00 a. m. just as she opens up.
you put her old ass in the back room, you empty the vault, the cash, the trays and you dump it in a fucking sack.
all right. You don't gotta be neat about it.
Jesus, Andy, I don't know. I don't know, I don't... I...
I don't know.
okay. Come on.
you can do it.
you can do it.
anybody can.
I just think... - I know, I know. It's too late to think.
it's too late.
this is our future.
okay.
Yeah. - There's a Mr. Mooney on line two.
he sounds like some nut case. But...
okay, I got it.
it just came apart, Andy.
Oh, my God, Andy.
what the fuck am I gonna do?
could he be in a different wing?
if you just pipe down a second, sir, I'm trying to help you.
what are you doing here? - Keep quiet one minute.
dad called me, all right. I just got here.
this lady, she doesn't... - Look, Miss, our father... I got it.
I got it. I know, but you might... - I told him, we've got no Charles Hanson.
wait a minute, I got a Nanette Hanson.
what? - There's a Nanette Hanson.
brought in about three hours ago. - What?
gunshot wounds.
where is she? - Emergency ICU.
Hey. Now. Hey, hold it. Wait, are you related? Sir? Are you?
dad?
she's unconscious.
and they...
she's...
they...
they say...
so, how are you feeling?
Yeah, I feel old.
I've been studying all week, and I can't retain a thing.
come on, you're going to pass with flying colors, Dad.
that's how I'm going to spend my birthday, taking that stupid test.
have you spoken to your brothers?
few weeks ago.
yeah? How are they?
busy.
you know, Dad, Hank is Hank and Andy's Andy.
no more cramming, birthday boy. It's the moment of truth.
what time is Doris coming to the store?
she said 12: 00 at the latest.
she has to baby-sit for her daughter.
I'll pick you up right after my test.
come on, come on.
all right, all right, all right.
perfect score, Mr. Hanson. - Bingo!
Congratulations.
if you'll take this to Window C, they'll give you the eye test.
I might not do so well on that one.
I've been studying hard, of course. Thanks. - All right.
that's my store!
what happened? What's happening? Let's go!
sir, sir, just stay behind the yellow line. - What's happening?
I want to know what's happening. - Behind the yellow line.
Where's my wife? Where's my wife? - Calm down. Please calm down.
I love you.
there are more tests we can do, but from what we've seen so far, it's very unlikely.
there's no brain activity.
and statistically speaking, there's very little chance for recovery.
why was Mom working?
I thought she didn't work at the store anymore, that's what Katherine told me.
Doris had to baby-sit, I had to get down to the DMV, get my eyes tested.
today's my birthday.
Where's your brother?
he...
he says he can't take it. To let him know if...
if he can help, but he just can't see her like that.
he's 28 years old.
he's a goddamn punk from Red Hook.
red Hook. What was he doing up here? What in the fucking world? What he...
I mean, did he put a map on the wall and throw a dart?
it's so absurd. It's so goddamn arbitrary.
why me? Why her?
what was this goddamn kid doing?
you belong in hell.
Yeah. I understand. All right. Thank you.
look, it might be better if you call, make an appointment?
well, I'd rather wait.
please. Steve...
dad.
you have to make a decision, Dad.
the gun was bought in Texas.
stolen Texas driver's license, his ID, fake, the gun turns up in New York, a year later.
mom needs you to make a decision, Dad. - Andy, just leave him alone.
well, something has to be done, he has to make a decision.
just leave him to his grief for one minute.
mom is in the hands of Jesus. - Now, will you cut it out with that crap?
you shouldn't push Dad to make a decision he doesn't wanna make.
well, he has to make a decision.
Hey, Patrick.
we know it's difficult, Mr. Hanson.
let her go.
let her go.
let her go.
Almighty and ever living God.
remember the mercy with which you graced your daughter, Nanette, in this life.
receive her, we pray, into the mansions of the saints.
as we make ready our sister's resting place "Look also with favor on those who mourn.
and comfort them in their loss.
because God has chosen to call Nanette from this life, commit her body to the earth, for we are dust and to dust we shall return.
I'm so sorry for your loss. She was a wonderful person.
she was a wonderful woman. - Yes.
I'm so sorry. - You have my deepest condolences.
she was a dear friend.
so sorry for your loss, your mother was a good person.
I'm so sorry.
God bless you.
there's no way I can make this scene, Andy.
he was always such a baby.
Yeah.
I can't really talk right now.
I can't, I...
I have to go. Andy needs me.
22nd precinct.
detective Barrett, please.
just a moment, sir.
I'm sorry, he's not in right now.
is there anyone down there that knows anything about the Nanette Hanson case?
who's speaking, please? - Charles Hanson, yeah.
just a moment, sir.
sergeant Sullivan.
Yeah, good morning, Sergeant.
I've been trying to reach Detective Barrett but he doesn't return my calls.
would you like to leave a message, sir?
no, I wouldn't like to leave another message.
doesn't anyone down there give a damn?
doesn't anyone down there work for a living?
would you like to leave a message, sir?
don't you know how important this is to me?
I know, I just...
you know, I thought I was going to be able to work it out, but...
but I couldn't get the money together, you know.
all my friends think I'm going to be there, what am I going to tell them?
you know, I mean, there's going to be other field trips.
not to The Lion King, there won't.
look, Dad, if you weren't going to pay for it, you should have just said so and saved me the humiliation of having to tell all my friends that you're a loser.
Hey, this is Hank. I must be out, so leave a message at the beep.
I know you're there. Pick up the phone.
pick up the phone.
pick up the fucking phone, you fucking faggot.
Andy, I'm here. - Where have you been?
here. I called in sick.
and what the fuck were you doing with that fucking asshole?
I was scared, all right? So I... - I didn't say anything about
a fucking gun, God damn it.
but we got to talk.
Andy.
meet me at Mooney's.
you still can't get by? To see Mom?
what am I going to say? - Don't say anything. Fuck.
who else knows? - Nobody.
you didn't tell anyone? - No.
no one saw you talking with Bobby? - No.
all right. Nobody saw you here?
no, come on, it was crowded, it was busy. No, no.
did he rent the car with you? - Did he what?
did he rent the fucking car with you? - No, no, no.
all right, did you...
you picked him up? - Yeah.
at his house. - Did anyone see you there, at his house?
did anyone see you at his house? - No, no.
nobody saw you at the house? - No.
did you clean the car? Did you wipe the car down?
did you wipe the floor? - Yeah, I totally... Totally, totally.
did you leave anything in the car? - No, of course not.
we're probably okay.
if they don't connect the car to us, we're probably okay.
that's what I was thinking.
go back to work, totally normal. - Okay.
I'm so sorry, Andy. I'm sorry.
I don't think I can get through this.
shut up.
I loved her so much. - Just shut the fuck up.
if he had to take somebody out, why couldn't it have been him?
one new message.
this is Mike Steuben calling from Auto Rent for Mr. Henry Hanson.
Mr. Hanson, you returned a car the other day.
it seems you forgot some personal items in it.
please give me a call at 555-2649 and ask for Mike Steuben.
again, that number is 555-2649. Thank you.
end of messages.
okay. God.
okay.
Hello, you've reached Auto Rent. Our office is currently closed.
our business hours... - Fuck.
fuck!
okay. All right. It's okay, it's okay.
excuse me?
that's right, sir. It's $255 plus tax.
but for an additional $17, I could upgrade you to a luxury.
or, for... Yes.
no, that's right, the mid-size is $255 plus tax.
unless you'd like to upgrade to an SUV, which I could offer you for 29...
excuse me, is Mike Steuben here? No, I know, I'm just looking for Mike.
so, would you like to upgrade to the SUV?
no, no. No, mid-size is fine, sir.
no.
thank you for calling.
I'm sorry.
good morning, how can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I got a message from Mike Steuben.
apparently I left something in a vehicle that I returned last Saturday. I think it was a CD.
Oh, well, you would talk to Mr. Steuben, then. He's the manager.
Yeah, I know, so could I speak with him?
I'm sorry, he's not here. You'll have to come back.
when will he be in? - I don't...
he won't be in at all today.
well then, maybe you can help me.
Oh, no. Sorry, sir.
I'm sorry, excuse me.
do you think... - I'm sorry.
will he be in tomorrow? - Yes, Auto Rent.
no, I...
no, I didn't say that, sir. That's not up to me.
no.
excuse me, can I get a beer? Thanks.
that's the guy, that's him.
yo, buddy.
this guy? - Yeah.
you were with Bobby Lasorda, Saturday?
what? - I asked you a fucking question.
what? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
what's your name? - I'm Hank.
Hank what? - You know what?
come. Why don't you... Let's go.
follow me, we can talk over here.
come on. Have a seat. - Is this all right?
Yeah, this is perfect.
so...
what's the deal, huh?
my sister is quite all of a sudden a widow. - Yeah.
she says you and Bobby had some work.
Bobby said it was work.
work that involved him getting shot and killed, but not you getting shot and killed.
no, I just got him the car.
I'm so sorry. - What the fuck does that mean?
well, Bobby said that he needed to rent a car, but that he...
this was Friday night and he didn't have a credit card, so I told him that I would rent him a car.
and I owed him some money. You know. That's it, I swear. It's...
I'm so sorry.
so what? You're lying. - No, I'm not.
because if Bobby wanted a car, he would have fucking stolen one.
Chris, go fucking wait outside.
let me handle this.
you got a driver's license?
a what? - You know, the...
the driver's license you show when you rent a car?
Yeah.
let me see it. - Yeah.
all right, sure.
here.
Henry Hanson. - Yeah.
this is your address, right?
Yeah, sure.
I'm going to be straight with you, chico.
you mind if I call you chico?
people call me Hank.
Bobby was a piece of shit.
I know it, you know it. That's not the point.
the point is that piece of shit was the father of my sister's child.
and he was paying the bills.
and now he's dead.
and I'm thinking, who's going to pay all these bills?
I'm so sorry.
sorry ain't going to pay the bills, chico.
I know, I know.
we need to negotiate a settlement, so make me an offer.
ten grand, done. It's 10 grand. I consider us even.
if you don't like 10, I can make it 15.
no. - My sister wants me to kill you.
or I could call the cops.
but I don't like cops.
and the cops ain't going to pay my sister's bills.
so, I think a settlement is pretty fair all-around.
day after tomorrow, chico. - Can I?
here. 8: 00.
you fucking crazy?
I was hoping that you had something left over from the settlement.
lend you money? You owe me $2, 000.
shocked to shit you'd even ask.
Martha,
I'm in serious trouble.
I don't give a shit what kind of trouble you're in.
the next time you show up here, better be to pay me.
listen, tell Danielle I love her.
if you loved her, you'd pay her fucking child support.
I'm so sorry for your loss. She was a wonderful person.
wonderful woman.
she was a wonderful woman.
God bless you.
there's no way I can make this scene, Andy.
he was always such a baby.
Yeah.
Hey, Gina. - I can't really talk right now.
Andy needs me. I got to go.
Gina, Gina.
excuse me, is Mike Steuben here?
not till noon, can I help you? - Yeah, yeah.
I returned a car last Saturday and I guess I forgot something.
Hanson?
that's right, Hanson. Yeah, and I'm pretty sure it was a CD.
hang on.
here we go, Mr. Hanson.
great. - I just need to see some ID.
Yeah, you know, I...
I lost my license.
you have a credit card, the one you used to rent the car with?
Yeah.
Yeah, this one. - All right.
okay, great.
thank you. - Take care.
Hello? - It's me.
Andy, Jesus! Fuck, man, we got problems.
Hi, Andy. This is Jake at the office.
really sorry to bother you, but the auditors are coming tomorrow.
they've noticed a few problems.
it's pretty urgent, so give a call when you get this.
you're going to have to get some sleep tonight.
have you given any thought to the store?
I mean, you're going to have to give it some consideration. It's just gonna...
I could open it up for you, you know, while you're at the hospital.
a few hours a day.
so people know you're still there.
I should burn the goddamn place down.
Andy, this is Jake.
now I hope you're checking your messages because we have a real mess here.
the auditors say that there's two terminated employees from your department still drawing checks.
and there's something about unpaid OASDI taxes.
look, you need to call us...
I got to go to the office tomorrow.
there's a problem. I'll go in the morning. I should be back later.
okay?
his mother's dying, and he's going back to work.
Yes!
pick up the phone.
I know you're there, pick up the phone, you fucking faggot.
Andy, I'm here.
what are you doing here? You don't have an appointment.
you know the deal, you can't just show up. - I know, I'm sorry.
come back in an hour, tonic water.
my mom's dying.
bummer.
next time, make an appointment.
stupid piece of shit.
stop talking to me like that.
what the fuck?
are you going to get tough?
are you going to hurt me?
why was there even a gun?
why was there even a fucking gun?
I gave you all the information you needed. Why was Bobby Lasorda even there?
why the fuck? - I didn't think I could do it alone.
I should fucking kill you.
how are we going to fix it so your shit don't fall on my shoes?
so, think now, who else knows?
commit her body to the earth.
for we are dust and to dust we shall return.
but the Lord Jesus will change our mortal bodies to be like his in glory.
so let us commend our sister to the Lord.
she hated it when I barbecued.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be what you wanted me to be.
I've never been very good at talking about feelings or showing you that kind of affection or support.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to be the father you wanted.
but I guess I wanted you to be better than me.
and I thought that if I push...
it may not mean anything to you, but I want you to know that I really do love you.
and I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm just so sorry.
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be the son you wanted.
you did the best you could.
still, yeah.
manage to seem to still like Hank.
he was a lot more of a fuck-up than I was.
he was the baby. - Yeah.
he needed us more. - Yeah, he needed you more.
you sure it wasn't his cute looks or his puppiness?
you were the first.
the first always has it rougher.
Yeah, so I'm told.
you know, the four of you, I never felt like I was part of the club.
you sure I'm your son?
Gina and I have got to get back to the city.
Andy?
my dad.
Andy.
okay.
why don't we pull over?
my dad.
Oh, God.
it's not fair! It's not fair!
all my life I've been afraid of becoming like him. All my life!
all my life with you, and it's not fair.
he can't just say he's sorry and make it all go away.
it's too late.
it's not that easy!
it's not fair! It's not fucking fair!
no, Dad.
Oh, God!
he can't do that!
Andy.
Andy.
I'll be back in a bit. - Where are you going?
I'll be back soon, I just got to... I got to deal with some stuff.
what's going on?
what if you come home and I'm not here?
you got some place you got to be?
your boss called and he wants you to call him right away.
are you in trouble?
they just miss me.
something has to change.
what do you mean? - I mean that this just isn't working.
what's not working? - The life that we have.
it was really bad before Rio and now it's even worse.
you never tell me anything that's going on anymore.
I don't understand.
neither do I.
what was that in the car yesterday?
I could help.
I don't need any help.
do you realize that I've been having an affair?
what's that supposed to mean?
means I've been fucking another guy.
every Thursday, me and your brother, Hank. We get together and we fuck.
not only that, he loves me.
and he still finds me attractive.
all the time.
not just on vacation.
Hank?
Yeah, Hank.
aren't you gonna say anything?
are you gonna get angry?
where are you gonna go? - I was just gonna go to my mother's.
How're you gonna get there?
I was gonna take a cab.
I could really use some, some money.
I'll go to the bank later.
here.
Hi, you've reached Gina and Andy. Leave a message.
please hang up and try your call...
come on.
last person I ever thought I'd see again as long as I lived.
Charlie Hanson.
you're still a crook?
you come all this way to insult me?
did you hear anything about a holdup at the Westchester Shopping Mall?
what would I know about Westchester?
that's just for upstanding citizens such as yourself.
have you heard anything?
why would I hear anything about anything? I sell diamonds.
and fence them. - Never!
did you hear of a young guy called Bobby Lasorda?
wrong tree, Charlie.
I'm sorry.
I don't give a shit about your little side business,
I don't care about anything anymore, except finding the guy who did this.
do you know anything?
I remember when Charlie Hanson started out on the streets.
young and cocky, good cutter. A long time ago, Charlie.
you always hated my guts, you called me a crook, but you didn't know shit about how the world works, or what some people will do for money.
I guess, now you know, Charlie.
the world is an evil place, Charlie.
some of us make money off of that, and others get destroyed.
he walked in here, he looks a little bit like you, Charlie.
he walked in here and I almost knew him, right off the bat.
hello.
it's me.
Andy, Jesus, man, we got problems.
what do you mean, problems?
Bobby's girlfriend's got a fucking brother, okay.
and the guy is blackmailing me, all right.
he said he's gonna go to the cops, all right, or kill me if I don't pay him $10, 000.
all right, all right.
just stay there, I'll be right over, I'll figure something out.
Andy, this guy isn't fucking around. - All right, I'll figure something out.
Andy, Jake needs to see you.
they're all in the conference room with the IRS guys.
they're going all the way back - through your accounts. - Just fuck 'em, I got to go to my dad's.
I'm gonna have to tell them you were here.
for God's sake, say something.
okay.
we're in trouble.
the worst trouble imaginable. You're aware of that, right?
so, why don't we try and fix it?
there's almost no choice, but you're gonna have to follow my lead.
no questions, no hesitations.
I've done that before, all right, and that's how come I'm standing here, with my life going down the fucking toilet.
fuck you, fuck you, I'll do it alone.
you can sit here and wait till you go to jail and take it up the ass for the rest of your fucking life.
let's do it already, what's your idea?
sorry, what's your idea?
what's Bobby's girlfriend's name?
Chris. Yeah, Chris.
Chris.
call Chris, tell her to get her brother over to her apartment.
what for? - We'll meet him.
he figures we owe him $10, 000, we have to resolve it.
resolve it how?
play it by ear, see what happens, maybe we pay him.
he's never gonna let us off the hook.
all right, we're gonna be paying him back for the rest of our lives.
Hey, you finally figured out something for yourself.
let's just get the money, see what happens.
where are we gonna get $10, 000?
no, that might be easier.
call Chris.
Taxi!
Andy, Jesus Christ! You're gonna kill him.
come on.
shit.
come on.
hold the bag. Hold out the fucking bag!
hold it open like this. Hold it open like that!
I got it, I got it.
Oh, shit, do you want these? - Just put it in the bag!
put it in the bag!
out. - Got it.
Oh, my God, Andy.
did you touch anything? - Did you go crazy?
did you touch anything? - Are you fucking nuts?
did you touch anything? - Wait, you didn't have to kill him, all right.
he's not gonna go to the cops. All right? He's a drug dealer.
Yeah, I guess he'll just go to some other dealers and suppliers and that's all we need, is 10 South Americans chasing us for the rest of our lives. Did you touch anything?
I don't think so.
you don't think so? - I don't think so, no!
no, I didn't touch anything! - Think, God damn it, you think!
I don't... I don't like this, Andy! - Did you touch anything?
I don't like... - Shut up! Shut up!
did you touch anything? - No.
are we good?
let's go.
you got the money, chico?
I don't like wasted trips.
you don't look happy.
mind if I call you Groucho?
no, I don't mind.
like what you're seeing? - Yeah, a lot.
stand up. Stand up! - All right, all right.
turn around. - All right, all right, all right.
so how we gonna do this?
gladly pay you the money, got plenty of it.
how do we know you're not gonna bleed us for the next couple of months?
I just want enough to take care of Chris.
that's nice, my brother wouldn't take care of me like that.
Hey, what do you say, Chris, should I trust this guy?
Yes. - Speak up. What?
Yes.
I don't think so.
no, Andy, don't, don't, don't...
what did you say? - No, you can't do that, I won't let you.
you won't let me? - No, no more, you kill her, you're gonna have to kill me.
not such a bad idea.
you know, in fact, it's a pretty good one.
you know I know.
what do you know?
I know.
I'm sorry.
I fucked it all up.
just do it.
do it.
go ahead.
come on.
you'd be doing me a favor.
come on.
get the hell out of here.
get the hell out of here! Go!
go!
Hank! Hank!
move out of the way, move out of the way.
you'll have to move your vehicle. Move out of the way.
Hi, Mr. Hanson.
stick your head in. If he's awake now, you can spend a couple of minutes with him.
dad?
I never meant to hurt her.
I just needed money.
there wasn't supposed to be any gun.
she wasn't supposed to be in the store. Everything just went wrong.
it's okay, Andy.
it's okay.
nurse, the heart monitor cut out for a second.
it does that, don't worry. If it happens again, just press reset.
I don't want to see that. don't ever show me that again.
you scared gigi.
Madison! - want to see again?
no, no thank you. - no, no!
I know I have said this a hundred times,
but I just can't believe my little sister is getting married.
she is.
Sully didn't think you'd bring the cooler.
what?
of course I bring the cooler.
in what universe do I not bring the cooler?
look at them.
you know what I love about those guys?
they bring their own beer?
no.
that they love henry as much as I do.
groom, groom. groom, groom, groom, groom, groom.
Henry dunn.
all tarted up to impress the swells.
there's only one person here I need to impress.
Yep, your father-in-law.
I don't know about daddy dearest,
but there's a smoking hot rich girl checking you out.
come on.
I love you - me? - me.
me. - no, me.
no, you said me. - no, she said me.
Yes, you. - yes.
I knew it. sorry, guys. I win.
who's getting married?
uh, the groom is my best friend from growing up.
you look familiar.
Yeah, i grew up on the island.
right. you're sheriff mills' kid.
what a shame.
all those people. terrible.
I never would have believed something so awful could happen around here.
we're still waiting on people, daddy.
have you seen cousin ben?
I don't want you to worry.
it's my job to make sure everything goes according to plan.
uncle marty!
Henry! my boy!
all right! let's get this party going!
uncle marty. - henry, henry.
Hi, marty.
Oh, come on, trish, it's uncle marty to you.
you're part of the family now.
in fact, for the entire week, it's going to be uncle marty for everyone!
uncle marty, i'm so glad you're here.
Yeah, family's everything.
how did you find a mariachi band in seattle?
you're the only guy who could pull it off.
never mind, i don't want to know.
no, you don't want to know. - come on, i want you to meet my dad.
Oh, he's going to love me.
thought you might never get out of that cab.
well, i needed a moment.
second thoughts? - about going home?
you know, i told him you'd come.
Trish. trish.
I am so excited.
Hi, you look great. - oh, no.
how was your trip from la?
I am feeling a bit shaky from the flight.

Oh, my god.
Oh, what do you know? I do feel better.
here's to all of us...
hooking up with all them.
we're still waiting on cousin ben.
he's always late.
he always answers, though.
give him a call again.
voice mail again.
we can wait if you want.
no. no, we should go. - okay.
all right, let's get her going.
all wellingtons on deck. pardon me, sir.
wellingtons, please.
Hi, sweetheart.
Where's henry?
okay, that's everyone.
say cheese. - cheese.
shouldn't you be there?
I don't think that's the plan.
there'll be plenty of photo ops this week.
you didn't think I was going to show, did you?
I knew you were coming.
I didn't. - no?
but I realized if I didn't come home now, i might never.
and that scared me.
you know, it's been seven years, ab, since the murders.
the island's moved on. it feels normal again.
that's why trish and I are getting married there.
you'll see, it's the place we loved as kids.
that would be nice.
Abby so should have been his best man.
you're mixing up best man with best friend.
best friend takes care of the feelings.
best man takes care of the bachelor party.
please tell me it's going to be something seriously debauched.
it's probably your cousin ben.
tell him we can charter a boat for him tomorrow.
hunter jennings
no, it's... it's not him.
come on. you don't know about the murders?
John wakefield-- he killed, like, six people.
how can you not remember?
Chloe has a thing for serial killers.
it's so not a thing.
what set wakefield off? - that's the big mystery.
seven years ago he just showed up on the island and started killing.
he chopped, hung,
and burned anyone that was unlucky enough to get in his way.
you know, um, henry's friend abby?
her mom was one of 'em.
so she was on the island when... - yeah.
so that's why she's...
Abby mills.
Hiya, jimmy.
I knew someday you'd come back to me.
and I knew you'd be here. - oh, yeah? anhow's that?
I could smell you from the mainland.
Oh, so that's how it gonna be, huh?
big city girl now.
so, uh, i've changed, too.
uh, the hat or the gloves?
no, i'm married now.
you are such a liar.
Yeah, yeah, no, i'm kidding. no, but I had you for a second, right, didn't i?
no, i was just feeling pity for the poor girl.
all right, pretend like I didn't.
Hey, abby, welcome home!
it's just a visit.
Hey, abby, there's room.
Oh, thanks. I think I'll walk.
bring the bags to the hotel. - okay.
let's go!
mom?
whoa, it's okay. it's okay.
the killer's dead, abby.
should've cut down that tree a long time ago.
come on, come on. let's get out of here.
look, sooner or later I was gonna walk past that tree, so I thought...
why not get it out of the way?
Yeah. no, great. ease into it.
Hey, maybe we can drop in and say hi to your dad while we're at it.
okay, bad idea.
Henry! henry dunn! you're here!
does maggie know you're coming?
nobody does.
you grew up so beautiful.
just the best week ever. now...
I've kept the afternoon open so that everyone could get settled.
great. - the welcome dinner is tonight at 7: 00.
and, you two, we have a lot of work to do.
your wedding party has the entire inn for the week.
and, since it's the end of season,
you practically have the whole island to yourselves.
Oh, sorry. - sorry.
excuse me. see you at dinner.
did you show trish's niece the bloody finger in the box trick?
I might've had something to do with it.
well, i knew everyone was going to love you.
get in there. - cal!
Oh, this is nice.
wonder what that's about?
sailing?
my bounty is a boundless as the sea my love is deep.
you always said you wanted to sail, so I rented a boat.
I thought maybe we could slip away one day this week.
how do I look?
dangerous.
do you know what I love about you?
you always think of everything.
look at him. he's afraid to get his tighty-whites wet.
you ever see me dressed for the love boat,
you get a harpoon and put me out of my misery.
who did he bring over today?
a wedding party.
Trish wellington is marrying henry dunn.
Really? - yeah.
the princess and the pauper. - yeah.
Henry's okay.
for a guy who only came to the island
for the summers and knew a lot about boats.
tell me his psycho little brother isn't coming.
I don't know. I'll tell you who did come, though.
Abby. - no. don't go back to that, man.
she dumped you.
she didn't even give you a kiss good-bye in the rearview mirror.
that wasn't about me.
Oh, no, of course it wasn't about you.
you know what your problem is? you're too nice.
Hey, al, you need some help?
get over here.
way too nice.
I think something's caught in the rudder.
I think it's just seaweed, al.
okay, so...maybe when she left,
it was because of her mom and the bad stuff that went down.
but in all these years, did she ever call you?
what, are you giving dating advice now?
I got it.
keep it as a souvenir.
Hey, excuse me. that's... that's my bag. thanks.
look at this place.
when you think about it,
you're like something out of a fairy tale.
you washed a millionaire's boats when you were a kid,
and then you grow up to marry his daughter.
I don't think Mr. Wellington considers it much of a fairy tale.
Henry, listen to me. Never...
never let that old man intimidate you. - I won't.
I promise. - Good boy.
now, Henry, tell me about that blond on the boat.
you know the one I'm talking about? You know, the...
Chloe.
yeah?
Chloe.
I have something for you.
Oh, yeah? Is it big?
well, "big" is a relative term, isn't it?
are you going to show me
or are you just going to think about it?
I might just think about it for a bit.
that's my Cal-- always thinking.
question is are you big?
I promised Madison we'd find her a friend to play with.
she's fine. Look at her.
she's having a great time.
Madison, you have one more minute
before you have to get ready for dinner.
did you hear me? One more minute.
Madison?
Jd, you in there?
just want to see if you need anything for tonight.
look, I don't know if you want to hear this or not,
but I'm glad you came.
with mom and dad gone,
you and uncle Marty are the only family I have.
it means a lot.
Hello?
Hello?
look at you! You look amazing!
yeah? - Yeah.
Thanks.
that's good, 'cause... 'cause I've decided.
I'm gonna have fun tonight.
no, no, no, no, no, strike that.
I'm going to have fun this whole week and...
anything you need, I got your back.
you...you don't even have to ask.
have you been drinking?
a little bit.
a little bit?
so Abby seems like a great girl.
all this time, I've heard about "Henry's friend,
now I get it; you're right. She's really sweet.
I know! I told you!
am I the only one who thinks that
men and women can't just be friends?
you've never had a guy who was just a friend?
no.
What?!
you know, now that I think about it,
I did have that one friend that was a guy.
you remember.
that doesn't matter.
remember how he'd go on about his wife, how he loved her...
excuse me.
one second.
Hello, Trish.
hunter...
what are you doing here?
hunter...
I'm getting married.
are you sure?
that guy is my hero.
he's not that great.
Oh, god, here we go.
no, no, no, no, I'm serious.
uncle Marty's, what, 50?
he's not married... - Okay.
no kids...
and here he is trying to tap some hot thing half his age.
come on!
Oh-oh, okay, Oprah, so in, uh,
what world does that make him not a superhero?
as far as I'm concerned, eating ain't cheating.
Oh, my God, tell that to your boyfriend in Seattle.
how's it going?
we were just talking about the groomsmen.
so, you and Henry...
you've been friends for a long time;
you must've hooked up at least once, right?
I...
everybody having fun?
Yeah. Yeah.
has anyone seen Jd?
I'm on it; I'll find him. - No, wait, that's not why I asked.
I know.
go find that fiance of yours,
and let me worry about finding your brother.
Oh, hey, you might want to start...
at the cannery. I'm on it!
we should go to Dad.
he will make Hunter leave.
No!
daddy will just cause a big scene and embarrass henry.
you have to tell Henry.
Henry is the last person I want to know.
I mean, i don't want anything to ruin this wedding.
Trish, he's gonna be your husband.
couples shouldn't have secrets.
Shea, please...
we all know that you live the perfect life, so
don't pass judgment on mine.
Okay...look...
if you have any doubts...about henry...or getting married,
now is the time to speak up.
but I don't.
I love henry.
and I'm going to marry him.
appreciate it.
it means a lot to me.
I'm curious if anybody else had seen you inside.
I did as you asked-- straight to trish.
I don't know if you know how important is that you succeed here.
for her sake.
I just couldn't tell, but, um...
she was definitely surprised.
uh, trish did agree to meet me in the morning, though.
well, that's progress.
I just want you to know, if there's anything you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.
I'm not leaving this island without her.
my daughter's not marrying henry dunn.
Oh, my god!
Abby!
Nikki!
look at you!
coming in here all aphrodite.
you're trying to make us local girls look bad.
Oh, please!
you're gorgeous.
yet you probably forgot that it's boring as hell here,
most of the time.
you looking for someone special?
Yes, but not the fisherman you're so subtly implying.
there's my perp.
any trouble?
JD?
a lamb among lions.
okay, then.
I'm gonna text henry.
make room, you animals.
any of you so much as lay a hand on this flower,
I'll nail your tongue to the bar.
who's up next?
you.
big city girl.
get over here.
who are you calling a big city girl?
that's a pretty dress.
you wearing that for me?
I hope your game is better than your banter.
our cousin ben wellington
Madison!
it's time for bed, sweetie!
Oh, may i?
you know...your daughter and my nephew...
they make a stunning couple, don't you think?
Ah, love.
love's a funny thing, isn't it?
I fail to see your point, mr. dunn.
uncle marty.
Aw, come on, everybody calls me uncle marty.
your point.
well...I'm talking about purpose, y'know?
I'm talking about my true calling in life.
I thought you were in sales.
see, one thing I know for certain,
is that I was put on this earth to protect men like henry
men who deserve true love and happiness-- from men like you.
is that supposed to be some sort of a threat?
threat?
now, come on...
we're just sitting around chatting like a couple of pals, ar't we?
anyway...
pretty soon, you and me...
we're gonna be family.
thanks for the cigar.
my, i thought you'd be better than this.
I'm at an emotional disadvantage.
so they don't have any phones in la, huh?
Nope.
e-mail...
not that I saw.
you telling me you didn't miss me a little bit?
I didn't say that.
then you did miss me.
tell you what
I make this, you have to stop asking me so many questions.
and if you don't?
name it.
really!
you got yourself a deal there, big city girl.
scratch.
double or nothing?
do you mind?
stop being a creep.
what?
I like your tat.
broken hearts.
is he bothering you?
no, shane, i haven't even met the guy.
Oh, we, allow me.
this is jd dunn.
his family used to work summers on the island.
Jd...this is Kelly.
we used to go out.
you like the tattoo?
I did it.
you want to show him the other ones you have?
don't do this.
what?
it's cool.
me and Jd, we're just...catching up.
right?
so, heard you tried to whack yourself again.
now, was that just an attention- getting kind of thing,
or were you really, really sad?
you know what?
you two probably have a lot to talk about,
wt with all the cutting an+++d the suicidal...
that's enough, Shane!
that's enough, shane!
come on, come on!
Hi, Dad.
you okay?
never better.
you're...
probably wondering about the truck.
it seems fine.
that's the...that's the way I feel...
the heater still works.
did you get the cards I sent?
the ones at christmas?
listen, i was...
thinking maybe, now that you're here...
thanks for the ride, dad.
will you unlock the door, please?
I feel like I owe you an apology.
for what?
if I didn't have you out there looking for Jd,
you never would have run into your dad like that.
we both knew that part of me coming home was dealing with my dad.
I feel like I didn't do a very good job
of watching your back tonight.
are you kidding me?
you broke up a bar fight with a pool cue.
maybe if I wasn't playing pool, there wouldn't have been a fight.
come on.
you know Jd. He's gonna do whatever he wants.
I'm just afraid that one of these days he's gonna
do something a whole lot worse than just pick a fight.
maybe,
but...there's a part of him that's very sweet.
Yeah.
who were you playing pool with?
Chloe?
Chloe, darling, when I said swimming, i meant the pool!
what are you doing?
what are you waiting for?
okay.
I want to show you something.
uh-uh, you gotta catch me first.
Chloe...
God...wait
hold on!
Chloe?
honey, did you have a bad dream?
no? What's wrong, then?
did you know people died here?
what?
people were killed on this island.
who told you that?
Madison...
who said that?
my new friend told me.
Chloe?
