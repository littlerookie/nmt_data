OK, EVERYONE, LET'S QUIET DOWN.
quiet DOWN.
I SAID QUIET!
look, YOU ALL WANT HELP,
and I REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT.
but IT'S GONNA HAVE TO HAPPEN ONE AT A TIME,
and LATER OR NOT AT ALL.
or NOT AT ALL!
now LEAVE US ALONE.
go.
sometimes IT HELPS TO PRETEND IT'S REAL.
how DID YOU GET THEM TO LISTEN TO YOU?
I JUST TOLD THEM THAT I WOULD DO THE SAME FOR THEM LATER.
Yeah, GREAT, BUT HOW DO YOU KEEP THEM FROM COMING BACK?
you DON'T.
who ARE YOU?
hmm, IT'S A LONG STORY.
let's HAVE A SEAT.
so THE GOOD NEWS IS, I'M NOT DEAD.
the BAD NEWS IS, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE
listening TO PEOPLE WHO ARE?
and HELPING THEM.
it's HOW THEY CAN GET PEACE,
and YOU CAN GET A LITTLE FOR YOURSELF.
you SAID IT MIGHT CHANGE OVER TIME,
like THE GHOST VOICES MIGHT GO AWAY?
anything IS POSSIBLE, YES.
any CHANCE I CAN SPEED UP THAT PROCESS?
I MEAN, WITH LIKE A BASEBALL BAT TO MY HEAD?
some MEDS?
my MOTHER TRIED EVERYTHING BUT THE BASEBALL BAT,
and TRUST ME, IT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO GO.
I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS THE WRONG WAY.
hey...
what YOU HAVE IS A GIFT.
Yeah, FROM SOMEONE WHO REALLY HATES ME.
Fiona, YOU'RE BACK.
tell ELI HOW HE CAN HELP YOU.
I WANT HIM TO KNOW I DON'T BLAME HIM.
blame HIM? WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
man: EXCUSE ME...
are YOU ELI JAMES?
and FRIENDS.
who ARE YOU?
detective NEELY.
you're WANTED FOR QUESTIONING
in CONNECTION TO THE DEATH OF FIONA RAINE.
Melinda: WHAT MAKES HIM SO SURE IT WAS ARSON?
they're NOT SURE ABOUT ANYTHING,
but THEY FOUND ACCELERANT TRACES NEAR THE POINT OF ORIGIN.
and THAT WOULD BE NEAR ELI'S OFFICE?
right OUTSIDE.
so HE'S A SUSPECT?
no, OFFICIALLY HE'S A "PERSON OF INTEREST.
they DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO HOLD HIM HERE.
but UNOFFICIALLY?
unofficially, THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
if HE HAD A REASON TO BURN DOWN HIS OWN OFFICE.
I THINK IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO
with THE ARGUMENT PEOPLE HEARD.
between HE AND FIONA.
you KNOW, PAYNE SAID THAT HE HAS
a REALLY BAD REPUTATION AT SCHOOL.
and THERE'S THE GHOST.
and WHAT ABOUT HER?
right BEFORE THE POLICE CAME IN,
she SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T BLAME HIM.
blame HIM FOR WHAT? WHO KNOWS?
but SHE'S A GHOST.
I'll SEE YOU AT HOME?
Mm-hmm. OK.
so IS IT TRUE?
did YOU START THE FIRE?
No!
but THANKS FOR ASKING.
you KNOW, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT FIONA.
I CAN SHRINK MY OWN HEAD, THANKS.
look, I TOLD YOU IF SHE'S NOT IN THE LIGHT,
that SHE'S OBVIOUSLY HERE FOR A REASON.
so SHE NEEDS SOMETHING FROM YOU.
not TO MENTION WHAT YOU NEED FROM HER.
Oh, WHAT'S THAT?
well, IF YOU DIDN'T START THAT FIRE,
she MAY BE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN PROVE IT.
OK, LOOK. LET'S JUST PRETEND FOR A MINUTE
that THIS WHOLE THING ISN'T NUTS.
and NEITHER ARE YOU.
or ME. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
start TELLING THE TRUTH.
and ALL OF IT.
at FIRST, WHEN WE MET IN MY OFFICE,
she WOULD JUST SIT THERE WITH HER ARMS FOLDED AND GLARE AT ME.
so I SHOOK IT UP.
I KNEW SHE LIKED HORSES,
so I TOOK HER TO THE TRACK.
and SHE STARTED TO TALK.
what WERE YOU TREATING HER FOR?
general ATTACHMENT ISSUES. I WAS HELPING HER DUMP
an ON AGAIN-OFF AGAIN BOYFRIEND NAMED KEN
who'd BEEN MESSING WITH HER HEAD SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.
did THE BOYFRIEND KNOW THAT YOU WERE TALKING TO HER?
I DON'T THINK SO.
she MOVED A FEW TOWNS AWAY TO PUT DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM.
she RENTS A PLACE HERE WITH ROOMMATES THAT SHE MET THROUGH SCHOOL.
a DEAD-END, LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP.
that's HOW CO-DEPENDENT THEY WERE.
she EVEN ASKED MY ADVICE ON TREATMENT FOR HIM.
do YOU THINK HE COULD BE THE ONE WHO STARTED THE FIRE?
this GUY'S GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS,
but ARSON'S NOT ONE OF THEM.
what KIND OF PROBLEMS?
this GUY NEVER MET A CULT OR SUPERSTITION HE DIDN'T LIKE.
he ONCE KEPT FIONA ON THE PHONE ALL NIGHT
because AN AURA READER CONVINCED HIM
she WAS SEEING ANOTHER MAN.
was SHE?
Eli, DID YOU GET INVOLVED WITH YOUR PATIENT?
no.
but SHE WAS COMING DOWN WITH A CLASSIC CASE OF TRANSFERENCE.
so SHE WAS FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU?
night OF THE FIRE,
I JUST TOLD FIONA I COULDN'T TREAT HER ANYMORE.
she FREAKED.
that's WHY WE WERE AT MY OFFICE SO LATE.
she CALLED AND SAID SHE HAD TO SEE ME.
people HEARD YOU ARGUING.
what HAPPENED?
I TOLD I WOULD REFER HER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES.
she SAID SHE ONLY WANTED TO SEE ME.
I KEPT TELLING HER THAT COULDN'T HAPPEN.
she JUST KEPT YELLING.
then WHAT?
smoke STARTED COMING UNDER THE DOOR,
and I REMEMBER IT WAS SO THICK,
it FELT LIKE MY LUNGS WERE ON FIRE.
next THING I KNEW,
I GUESS I WAS DEAD.
this IS OUR OTHER ROOMMATE.
she WAS JUST ASKING ABOUT FIONA
Hi, NICE TO MEET YOU.
and ELI.
Oh.
I TAKE IT YOU GUYS ARE NOT BIG FANS OF ELI.
we DON'T WANT TO GET ANYONE IN TROUBLE.
that's OK. I'M NOT THE POLICE OR THE PRESS, SO...
what DON'T YOU LIKE ABOUT HIM?
well, HE WAS HER SHRINK, RIGHT?
Yes. HMM.
he SURE DIDN'T ACT LIKE ONE.
can YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC?
shrinks ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE, LIKE,
office HOURS, RIGHT?
it's USUALLY HOW IT WORKS.
well, THIS GUY, HE'D COME BY AT ALL DIFFERENT TIMES,
day AND NIGHT,
taking HER TO RESTAURANTS, BARS.
it WAS SO OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.
something ROMANTIC?
Heh. HE SURE WISHED IT WAS.
what ABOUT FIONA?
she LIKED THE ATTENTION.
the DRINKS WERE FREE.
and THAT'S AS FAR AS IT WENT WITH HER?
definitely. FOR SURE.
she HAS LOTS OF PICTURES OF THE THREE OF YOU,
but NO FAMILY PHOTOS.
do YOU KNOW WHERE SHE MIGHT KEEP THEM?
I DON'T KNOW.
but I ONLY MOVED IN IN THE SPRING.
you GUYS HAVE BEEN ROOMMATES FOR LONGER.
did SHE EVER TALK ABOUT THAT STUFF WITH YOU?
Fiona: ELI, NO...
Fiona: PLEASE...
please.
make IT STOP.
make WHAT STOP?
her.
make HER LEAVE US ALONE, OR I'LL MAKE HER,
like I MADE YOU.
ghosts HAVE THE ABILITY TO MANIPULATE ENERGY,
especially ANGRY GHOSTS.
this ONE SEEMS TO HAVE DONE IT A LOT LIKE
sunshine THROUGH A MAGNIFYING GLASS.
so YOU THINK THIS IS A PATTERN
because FIONA HAD A HISTORY OF ARSON?
she BURNED DOWN THE HOUSE
that SHE WAS LIVING IN WHEN SHE WAS 12.
how COME THE POLICE DIDN'T KNOW THIS?
how COME WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS?
cause SHE WAS SO YOUNG,
there WAS NEVER ANY CHARGES.
there WAS NEVER ANY CRIMINAL RECORD.
but SHE WAS A WARD OF THE STATE,
and IT WENT INTO FAMILY SERVICE'S FILES.
as HER THERAPIST,
I HAD ACCESS TO THOSE FILES.
so THAT'S WHY SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FAMILY PICTURES,
because SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FAMILY.
they DIED WHEN SHE WAS AT 3.
the HOUSE THAT SHE BURNED DOWN WAS HER FOSTER FATHER'S.
I TAKE IT SHE WASN'T TOO FOND OF THE GUY.
or HIS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ABUSE.
where DOES HE LIVE NOW, AN ASHTRAY?
he WAS OUT OF THE HOUSE WHEN SHE BURNED IT DOWN.
but SHE MADE HER POINT.
she GOT PLACED WITH ANOTHER FAMILY.
why DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING BEFORE?
because I-I THOUGHT SHE STARTED THAT FIRE BECAUSE OF ME.
I THINK SHE DIED BECAUSE OF ME.
how COULD SHE HAVE STARTED IT?
she WAS WITH YOU IN THE SAME ROOM.
I DON'T KNOW.
a HOMEMADE DEVICE WITH A FUSE HANGING OUT,
she DROPPED IT OFF AT THE FRONT RIGHT BEFORE SHE CAME IN.
so YOU THINK THAT SHE WANTED TO KILL YOU.
or AT LEAST THREATEN ME,
like SHE DID HER FOSTER FATHER.
but SHE HAD NO IDEA THE FIRE WAS GOING TO SPREAD.
OK, SO YOU FEEL RESPONSIBLE, WHY COME CLEAN NOW?
last NIGHT, I...
I HEARD HER VOICE AGAIN.
she WAS MAKING THREATS.
I WARNED YOU ABOUT THIS.
against YOU.
she SAID, "TELL HER TO LEAVE US ALONE,
or I'LL DO THE SAME THING TO HER THAT I DID TO YOU."
OK. SO WE NEED TO GET HER TO CROSS OVER.
she's OBVIOUSLY STICKING AROUND
for SOME REASON, AND IT'S NOT TO APOLOGIZE TO ELI.
here's SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS.
how COME ALL YOUR NOTES SMELL LIKE BEER?
because THEY WERE ON FIRE.
the BOTTLE WAS CLOSER THAN THE EXTINGUISHER.
I'm SMELLING A PILSNER,
maybe SOMETHING CZECH.
not BAD. I WENT TO COLLEGE.
OK. WE KNOW THAT SHE'S HAUNTING SOMEONE.
we CAN'T FIND THE BOYFRIEND.
what ABOUT THE FOSTER DAD?
Yeah, HE'S THE FIRST PERSON SHE TRIED TO COOK.
he DIED 6 YEARS AGO, HEART ATTACK, I THINK.
good RIDDANCE, IF YOU ASK ME.
how DID FIONA GET ALONG WITH HER FOSTER FAMILIES AFTERWARDS,
were THERE ANY MORE PROBLEMS?
no, SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL.
she WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
wish I COULD HAVE DONE MORE FOR HER.
do YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS?
it's ABOUT THE FIRE AT ROCKLAND UNIVERSITY.
some PEOPLE THINK FIONA STARTED IT.
is THERE A REASON MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T?
you KNOW WHAT,
forget WE ASKED. I'M SORRY.
you SHOULDN'T HAVE TO VIOLATE PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY.
screw CONFIDENTIALITY.
those RULES ARE THERE TO PROTECT THOSE KIDS,
and THEY'RE NOT PROTECTING FIONA.
look, I'M NOT SAYING ARSON'S A GOOD WAY TO SOLVE ANYTHING,
but THERE WERE THREE OTHER FOSTERS IN THAT HOME.
I SURE WISH WE'D KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON.
if FIONA STARTED THAT FIRE,
she DIDN'T JUST SAVE HERSELF, SHE SAVED ALL OF THEIR LIVES.
and IF SHE DIDN'T...
you KEEP SAYING "IF."
do THE MATH.
one KID WAS YOUNGER, 2 KIDS WERE OLDER.
old ENOUGH TO BE TRIED AS ADULTS?
can YOU GIVE US THEIR NAMES?
I CAN'T.
but I CAN TELL YOU THIS
after THE FIRE, WHEN I ASKED FIONA WHAT HAPPENED,
she ZIPPED THOSE LIPS TIGHT.
but THE SECOND THE COPS STARTED QUESTIONING HER OLDER SIBLINGS,
she CAME RIGHT OUT AND PRACTICALLY SHOUTED, "I DID IT!"
so YOU'RE SAYING YOU'VE SEEN HER GHOST,
but NOW YOU CAN'T FIND HER, SO YOU CAME HERE?
sometimes SPIRITS ATTACH THEMSELVES TO PLACES THEY KNOW.
I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD FIND HER IN HER BEDROOM.
that STILL DOESN'T TELL ME WHY HE'S HERE.
I, UM...
I CAN TALK TO THEM, TOO.
ghosts.
I KNOW, IT SOUNDS NUTS.
I STILL THINK SO MYSELF.
do YOU REALLY EXPECT US TO BELIEVE THAT?
I BELIEVE HIM. WHAT?
ever SINCE FI DIED,
we've BOTH HAD THIS FEELING...
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT,
BUBUT SOMEHOW WE FELT HER.
haven't WE, MARLEY?
and THAT'S BECAUSE SHE'S STILL HERE.
but SHE DOESN'T BELONG HERE. SHE REALLY NEEDS TO CROSS OVER.
well, GO TALK TO HER THEN.
Christian! WHY NOT?
what IS THE HARM?
Oh, ONE FAVOR.
she HAS THIS CD.
could YOU ASK HER IF IT'D BE OK
if I WAS TO KEEP IT,
before WE RELEASE THE REST OF HER STUFF?
we'd BE HAPPY TO.
if YOU'RE NEARBY AND YOU CAN HEAR ME,
we REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
what DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
the SAME AS I ALWAYS DID.
I WANT TO HELP YOU.
since WHEN DID YOU EVER HELP ANYONE?
look, WE NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
did YOU START THE FIRES OR DIDN'T YOU?
it WAS OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE.
I KNEW HE'D BE IN THERE. WHO ELSE WOULD HAVE STARTED IT?
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT THAT FIRE.
I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ONE AT YOUR FOSTER DAD'S HOUSE.
I STARTED BOTH.
why WORK SO HARD TO MAKE ME THINK YOU'RE AN ARSONIST?
why WORK SO HARD TO MAKE ME THINK YOU REALLY CARED ABOUT ME?
come ON, THIS IS SERIOUS.
this ISN'T A GAME.
that's FUNNY, COMING FROM YOU.
I JUST REMEMBER SOMETHING.
what YOU SAID TO ELI, YOU SAID, "LEAVE US ALONE." ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
back IN MY APARTMENT, YES.
OK, SO THEN WHO'S THE "US," FIONA?
because AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT HAD TO DO WITH YOU AND ELI, BUT NOW
I STARTED THOSE FIRES.
don't MAKE ME START MORE.
look, IF YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING
or SOMEONE, WE'RE NOT THE POLICE.
OK? WE DON'T WANT TO
Eli: WHOA, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
Melinda: SHE'S GONE.
what IF SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH?
she's COVERING FOR SOMEONE. MAYBE IT'S THAT BOYFRIEND,
but I JUST THINK IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT FIRST FIRE, YOU KNOW,
like A FOSTER KID.
we HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO ELSE LIVED IN THAT HOUSE.
guess I WON'T TAKE ANYTHING OUT TODAY.
structure EMPTY AT TIME OF FIRE.
occupants LATER ACCOUNTED FOR.
owner TOM MOODY
minors FEMALE, 12 YEARS,
female, 16 YEARS, MALE, 18 YEARS.
it WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN LIKE THIS.
you WERE JUST TRYING TO BE A GOOD SISTER.
which ONE ARE YOU COVERING FOR, HIM OR HER?
I WARNED YOU. STAY AWAY.
I'll MOVE ON WHEN YOU WILL.
maybe SOME THINGS ARE BETTER OFF LEFT ALONE,
you EVER THINK ABOUT THAT?
Fiona, NO.
I'm SORRY.
I REALLY AM,
but YOU BROUGHT THIS ON YOURSELF,
and NOW YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE.
that WAS A LONGSHOT, ANYWAY.
without A COURT ORDER,
the COUNTY KEEPS FAMILY SERVICE RECORDS SEALED.
why HASN'T MELINDA CALLED BY NOW?
she MUST HAVE FOUND SOMETHING.
maybe SHE HAS CALLED.
have YOU CHECKED YOUR ESP-MAIL?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S CRAZIER,
the FACT THAT SHE BELIEVES IN ALL THIS STUFF,
or THE FACT THAT I BELIEVE HER.
I HEARD THAT. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT
that SHE'S THE MOST AMAZING PERSON I'VE MET SINCE...
she's THE MOST AMAZING PERSON I'VE EVER MET.
I HEAR THAT, TOO.
Yeah. WHAT'S SO SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THESE NOTES, ELI?
Fiona ALWAYS DESCRIBED HIM IN SO MUCH DETAIL,
but SHE NEVER USED HIS LAST NAME.
he, WHO'S HE?
her BOYFRIEND. AND SOMETHING ELSE,
how WAS HE PACKING UP HER STUFF WHEN THERE WERE NO BOXES?
he WHO? YOU SAID YOU NEVER MET HIM.
Christian, THE ROOMMATE.
he SAID HE WAS PILING UP HER STUFF
so HE COULD RELEASE IT.
release IT? THAT'S THE WORD HE USED, RELEASE?
Yeah. I FOUND THAT ODD AT THE TIME.
the WHOLE THING WAS. RELEASING HER STUFF,
but WANTING TO KEEP SOME RANDOM FOLK MUSIC CD?
what KIND OF FOLK MUSIC?
African, I THINK. OK.
but WHAT DID HE PUT HER THINGS IN IF IT WASN'T BOXES?
he HAD SOME KIND OF METAL TUB.
didn't YOU SAY HER BOYFRIEND WAS INTO THE OCCULT,
and WEIRD BELIEFS?
Yeah, WHY? WELL, IT WAS AN AFRICAN CUSTOM,
part OF THE YORUBA TRADITION,
where POSSESSIONS OF SOMEONE WHO'S PASSED PREMATURELY
are SET FIRE TO.
that WAY IT'LL RELEASE THEIR SPIRIT.
you KNOW, WHY ELSE WOULD HE USE A METAL TUB
unless HE WAS GOING TO TIE-DYE EVERYTHING?
she SAID HER BOYFRIEND LIVED OUT OF TOWN.
well, WHAT IF SHE MADE THAT PART UP?
what IF SHE HAD NO BOYFRIEND?
what IF SHE HAD ALL THE PROBLEMS SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT,
but WITH SOMEONE SHE WASN'T ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH?
someone SHE WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM,
but SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO.
who SHE FELT SHE NEEDED TO PROTECT AT THE SAME TIME.
I THINK WE ALREADY KNOW THIS QUOTE, UNQUOTE BOYFRIEND.
and THE FOSTER BROTHER.
and THEY'RE BOTH.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
here,
breathe THROUGH THIS, OK?
because YOU COULD GET KILLED.
that's THE WHOLE IDEA.
they'll FIND ME, THEN THEY'LL KNOW THE TRUTH.
Christian, LOOK, I GET IT. OK, YOU WANTED TO PROTECT HER
and THAT'S WHY YOU FOLLOWED ME HERE.
we TOOK CARE OF EACH OTHER.
OK, WELL, LET'S TELL HER THAT,
all RIGHT? LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, COME ON.
she WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO GET HURT.
then WHY'D SHE HAVE TO START SEEING HIM?
Because! SHE NEEDED HELP FOR THE BOTH OF YOU.
OK, SHE JUST WANTED ADVICE FROM ELI.
come ON!
she WAS TRYING TO GET RID OF ME.
I WAS MORE LIKE A FAMILY THAN ANYONE SHE EVER HAD!
no, SHE WANTED TO HELP YOU JUST LIKE YOU HELPED HER.
I DIDN'T HELP HER, I KILLED HER!
but YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO.
you DIDN'T WANT HER TO TALK TO ELI, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
I SAW HER CRYING AFTER SHE TALKED TO HIM.
I SAW WHAT HE DID TO HER.
so I WENT TO HIS OFFICE AND STARTED THE FIRE.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO SCARE HIM AWAY.
like I DID IN THE FIRST FIRE WHEN WE WERE KIDS.
Eli NEEDS TO HEAR THIS, OK?
we JUST-LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE!
she'll NEVER FORGIVE ME!
I'm SURE THAT SHE'S ALREADY FORGIVEN YOU!
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
why DO YOU THINK
she WANTED US TO BELIEVE SHE WAS THE ARSONIST?
it's BECAUSE SHE LOVES YOU.
OK, BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO PROTECT YOU.
she's RIGHT, CHRISTIAN, LISTEN TO HER!
she's HERE! SHE'S HERE, OK?
she WANTS YOU TO LIVE, SO PLEASE, PLEASE JUST TAKE THIS.
JUST-PLEASE!
Oh, GOD, HE'S DYING!
it's TOO LATE!
no, IT IS NOT TOO LATE! ALL RIGHT, GO AND GET ELI!
quick! CHRISTIAN, COME ON!
Fiona: ELI, I NEED YOU. I NEED YOU TO HEAR ME.
I'm RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF YOU. I NEED YOUR HELP, PLEASE.
she STILL HASN'T ANSWERED. SHE'S NOT PICKING UP.
there's A FIRE. I COULDN'T HELP THEM...
whoa. WHAT?
what WAS THAT? THE GHOST.
the GHOST, WHERE? I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T SEE THEM.
it's RIGHT BY ME. THE ARCHIVES, HURRY!
Fiona, IS THAT YOU?
they NEED YOU TO COME RIGHT NOW.
slow DOWN, I CAN'T SEE YOUR LIPS MOVE.
you HAVE TO SPEAK SLOWLY.
they're IN TROUBLE, CHRISTIAN AND THAT WOMAN.
Melinda? WHERE IS SHE?
the ARCHIVES! HURRY!
Melinda: THE TUNNEL DOOR.
Eli? ELI, WHAT'S GOING ON?
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
what's GOING ON AT THE ARCHIVES?
Oh, MY GOD, MELINDA!
Hey, WE GOT A FIRE AT THE ARCHIVES. GOTTA GO.
you're THE ONE FROM THE HOSPITAL.
and THE FIRE, YOU
you WERE THERE, TOO.
we're IN MANY PLACES, IT'S TRUE.
Why?
what ARE YOU HERE FOR?
to WATCH.
but JUST NOW...
you DID MORE THAN WATCH. YOU-YOU SAVED ME,
didn't YOU?
we WERE ONLY RETURNING A FAVOR.
how DID I EVER HELP YOU?
that's NOT IMPORTANT NOW.
what's IMPORTANT IS YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.
understand WHAT?
we WATCH MANY LIKE YOU WHO DO WHAT YOU DO
but DON'T UNDERSTAND.
if YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME I SHOULD STOP,
you CAN SAVE YOURSELF.
understand THE PRICE.
you DON'T KNOW THE PRICE.
what PRICE?
you MOVE BETWEEN THE WORLD OF LIFE AND DEATH.
like YOUR FRIEND ELI,
sometimes YOU COME BACK FROM ONE WITH A TOUCH OF THE OTHER.
a TOUCH?
of DEATH.
be CAREFUL.
it MIGHT BRUSH OFF.
on WHAT?
on WHAT YOU TOUCH.
Melinda: IT'S OK. I BARELY BREATHED ANY SMOKE.
Jim: IT'S JUST A PRECAUTION.
look, I USED MY CLOTHING LIKE YOU TAUGHT ME A THOUSAND TIMES.
stayed LOW TO THE GROUND?
I'm HERE, AREN'T I?
don't I GET ANY CREDIT FOR THAT?
full CREDIT, OK?
all THE CREDIT IN THE WORLD. DO YOU WANT ANYTHING?
I'll GET YOU SOME WATER. YES.
I'll BE RIGHT BACK.
Hey, THANKS FOR LETTING THEM HAVE A MINUTE TOGETHER.
I STILL DON'T GET A GUY TRIES TO KILL HER
and ALL SHE WANTS TO DO IS GET HIM HELP.
Melinda: FIONA UNDERSTANDS, CHRISTIAN.
she LOVES AND FORGIVES YOU.
it's TIME FOR YOU TO BOTH SAY GOOD-BYE.
what CAN I TELL YOU?
that's MY WIFE.
we KEPT IN TOUCH AFTER THEY PUT US
in DIFFERENT FOSTER HOMES.
then AFTER I GOT A JOB AND MY OWN PLACE,
I HEARD HE'D BEEN GETTING INTO FIGHTS AND STUFF.
I ASKED HIM TO MOVE IN,
but I MADE HIM PRETEND HE WAS JUST
some ROOMMATE I MET ON THE INTERNET.
I WAS AFRAID PEOPLE WOULD FIGURE OUT
where WE CAME FROM.
the FIRE AND EVERYTHING.
what MADE YOU DECIDE TO GET HELP?
I NEEDED TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE.
christian LIKED TO PRETEND HE WAS MY BROTHER
taking CARE OF HIS LITTLE SISTER.
but HE HAS SO MANY ISSUES.
after A WHILE, IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME.
and I HAVE MY OWN ISSUES, TOO.
now I FEEL LIKE I'VE MADE EVERYTHING WORSE.
how DO I KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SEND HIM TO JAIL FOR KILLING ME?
the LAWYERS SAY, BASED ON HIS MENTAL STATE,
he'll STAY OUT OF PRISON.
so HE'S GOING TO ROT IN SOME AWFUL ASYLUM?
Fiona, YOU HAVE MY WORD, I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.
I THINK WITH THE RIGHT MEDICATION
your WORD? THAT'S WHAT CHRISTIAN'S DEPENDING ON?
look, ELI'S DONE EVERYTHING HE CAN FOR BOTH OF YOU.
no. FIONA'S RIGHT.
my WORD HASN'T MEANT MUCH, NOT TO HER.
what DOES THAT MEAN?
remember THAT NIGHT WHEN I CALLED
and I TOLD YOU THAT WE COULDN'T WORK TOGETHER ANYMORE?
but I KNOW, I KNOW YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME, I KNOW IT!
no, NO, YOU ARE CONFUSED.
no, I'M NOT!
I CAN FEEL IT.
you ARE A VERY NICE PERSON.
I've ENJOYED OUR SESSIONS.
but THERE IS NOTHING MORE THERE.
I LIED.
there WAS MORE.
much MORE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
Fiona, YOU'VE SEEN MY APARTMENT.
I HAVE PICTURES OF YOU EVERYWHERE.
next TO ALL OF YOUR OTHER PATIENTS, SO WHAT?
all THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT,
day AFTER DAY, NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,
was HOW I COULD MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
if YOU WERE UNHAPPY, SO WAS I.
you DON'T FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ALL OF YOUR OTHER PATIENTS?
Fiona, IF I CARED ABOUT THEM ALL THAT MUCH, I'D LOSE MY MIND.
if I CARED ABOUT YOU ANY MORE...
I'd LOSE MY JOB.
OK.
what AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH ALL OF THAT RIGHT NOW?
take IT WITH YOU.
wherever YOU'RE GOING.
what's THAT LIGHT?
that's WHERE YOU'RE GOING.
it's AMAZING.
you're A REALLY GOOD DOCTOR, YOU KNOW THAT?
I'm NOT SO SURE.
be SURE.
my HEART WAS BROKEN,
and NOW IT'S FIXED.
she's GONE.
man.
is IT ALWAYS LIKE THAT?
no.
sometimes IT'S BETTER.
come ON.
Hey. HEY.
everybody GOT WHAT THEY WANTED?
perfect. OH, YEAH.
honey, THEY'RE BEING POLITE.
Melinda ASKED FOR CHOPSTICKS,
and JIM ASKED FOR LOW SODIUM SOY SAUCE.
right. SORRY. SORRY. BE RIGHT BACK.
bad ENOUGH YOU GUYS MAKE HIM WORK AT THE STORE TOO, RIGHT?
he NEEDS 2 JOBS IF HE'S GOING TO PAY
for THAT VIDEO GAME THAT HE'S SO ADDICTED TO.
which, BY THE WAY, HE HAS NO TIME TO PLAY.
what?
do YOU THINK I'M HARD ON HIM?
no. NOT AT ALL. NOT US.
you KNOW, PARENTING IS A LOT HARDER THAN IT LOOKS.
and WHEN YOU TWO DECIDE TO HAVE KIDS,
you WILL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.
well...
here's TO US FINDING OUT SOMEDAY.
soon.
here, HERE. MMM.
excuse ME.
I'll BE RIGHT BACK.
Hey.
what's WITH THAT EMAIL YOU SENT ME?
come SEE ME BEFORE YOU LEAVE, IF NOT, BE CAREFUL.
what, DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER BAD OMEN?
what's THE DIFFERENCE?
I MEAN, NO MATTER WHAT, YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL.
you're GOING TO A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY.
there's POLITICS, SCARY FOOD.
you CARE ABOUT ME.
that's WHY YOU'VE BEEN SO MAD.
I FIGURED IT OUT. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO.
of COURSE I CARE.
a LOT?
you CARE ABOUT ME A LOT.
what DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
that YOU'RE ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS,
and THAT ALTHOUGH I FULL UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE TO GO,
it HURTS... TO KNOW THAT YOU WOULD PICK
an OLD PILE OF ARTIFACTS OVER ME。
Yeah, SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD BE NICE.
happy?
can I HAVE A HUG FOR THE ROAD,
maybe A BIG SQUEEZY, CHESTY ONE?
don't BE AN IDIOT.
I KNOW I PUSHED IT, I KNEW IT.
don't BE AN IDIOT, BE SAFE.
Hey, I'M COMING BACK HERE,
and I'M COMING BACK SAFE AND SOUND, OK?
I PROMISE YOU THAT.
OK
come to join my crew again, Master Turner?
not yours.His.
his.
Jack Sparrow sends his regards to you.
sparrow?
you didn't tell him.
we rescued Jack from the Locker along with the Black Pearl.
what else have you not told me?
there is an issue far more troublesome.
I believe you're familiar with a person called Calypso.
she is not a person.
she is a heathen god.
one who delights in cursing men with their wildest dreams and then revealing them to be hollow and naught but ash.
the world is well rid of her. Not quite so well, actually.
the Brethren Court intends to release her.
No! They cannot do that!
the First Court promised to imprison her forever.
that was our agreement. Your agreement?
I showed them how to bind her.
but she could not be trusted.
I... She gave me no choice.
we must act before they release her.
you loved her.
she's the valentine.
and then you betrayed her.
she pretended to love me.
she betrayed me.
and after which betrayal did you cut out your heart, I wonder.
do not test me.
I hadn't finished that.
you will free my father.
and you will guarantee Elizabeth's safety.
along with my own.
your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.
we will expect fair value in return.
there is only one price I will accept:
calypso murdered.
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.
Jack has sailed the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.
and with you no longer aboard, how do you propose to lead us there?
what is it you want most?
look at them all.
there's not been a gathering like this in our lifetime.
and I owe them all money.
as he who issued summons,
I convene this, the Fourth Brethren Court opened.
to confirm your lordship and right to be heard, please present your pieces of eight, my fellow cap'ns.
those aren't pieces of eight. They're just pieces of junk.
Aye. The original plan was to use nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.
but when the First Court met, the Brethren were to a one skint broke.
so change the name.
to "nine pieces of whatever we happened to have in our pockets at the time?
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.
master Ragetti, it's your turn.
I kept it safe, just like you said when you gave it to me.
aye, you have. But now I need it back.
sparrow.
might I point out that we are still short one pirate lord, and I'm as content as a cucumber to wait until Sao Feng joins us.
sao Feng is dead.
he fell to the Flying Dutchman.
that plagued ship.
he made you captain? They're giving the bloody title away now.
listen. Listen to me.
our location has been betrayed.
jones is under the command of Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.
who is this betrayer? Not likely anyone among us.
Where's Will? Not among us.
it's matters not how they found us. The question is, what will we do now that they have?
we should fight.
shipwreck Cove is a fortress.
a well-supplied fortress.
there is no need to fight if they cannot get to us.
there is the third course.
into another age, at this spot, when the First Brethren Court setting, captured the sea goddess and bound her.
this was a mistake.
Oh, we tamed the seas for ourselves, aye.
but opened the door to Beckett and his ilk.
better were the days when mastery of seas came not from bargains struck with eldritch creatures, but from the sweat of a man's brow and the strength of his back alone.
you all know this to be true.
gentlemen.
ladies.
we must free Calypso.
shoot him. Cut out his tongue!
shoot him, cut out his tongue, then shoot his tongue, and trim his beard.
sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.
calypso was our enemy then, she is our enemy now.
it's unlikely her mood's improved.
I would still agree with Sao Feng. We should release Calypso.
you threaten me? I silence you.
this is madness. This is politics.
meanwhile, our enemies are bearing down upon us.
if they be here already.
my sweet.
you come for me.
you were expecting me.
it has been torture to be trapped in this single form.
cut off from the sea.
from all that I love.
from you.
ten years I devoted to the duty you charged to me.
ten years I looked after those who died at sea.
and, finally, when we could be together again, you weren't there. - [Music box stops]
why weren't you there?
it's my nature.
would you love me if I was anything but what I am?
I do not love you.
many things you did, Davy Jones.
you are never cruel.
you have corrupted your purpose and so your self.
and you did hide away what should always have been mine.
Calypso.
I will be free.
and when I am, I would give you my heart.
and we would be together always.
if only you had a heart to give.
why did you come?
and what fate have you planned for your captors?
the Brethren Court?
all of them, the last thing they will learn in this life is how cruel I can be.
and what of your fate, Davy Jones?
my heart will always belong to you.
it was the First Court what we imprisoned Calypso.
we should set her free now.
and in her gratitude, she will see fit to grant us boons.
whose boons? Your boons?
utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.
if you have a better alternative, please share.
cuttlefish.
Aye.
let us not, dear friends, forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.
flipping glorious little sausages.
pen them up together, they'll devour each other without a second thought.
human nature, isn't it?
or... Or fish nature.
so, yes, we could hole up here well-provisioned and well-armed.
half of us would be dead within the month.
which seems quite grim to me, any way you slice it. Or...
uh...
as my learned colleague so naively suggests, we can release Calypso, and we can pray that she will be merciful.
I rather doubt it.
can we pretend she's anything other than a woman scorned like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.
if we can't let it go back to the sea.
we are left with but one option.
I agree with, and I cannot believe the words are coming out of my mouth...
...Captain Swann. We must fight.
you've always run away from a fight. Have not.
have so. Have not.
have so. Have not!
you have so, and you know it. Have not. This is slander and calumny.
I have only ever embraced that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.
I submit that here now that is what we all must do:
we must fight...
...to run away.
Aye! Aye!
as per the code, an act of war, and this be exactly that, can only be declared by the pirate king.
you made that up. Did I ?
I call on Cap'n Teague, keeper of the code.
sri Sumbhajee proclaims this all to be folly!
hang the code. Who cares ?
code is the law.
you're in my way, boy.
the code. The code.
as set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.
that can't... How did... Sea turtles, mate.
sea turtles.
Ah. Barbossa is right.
hang on a minute.
it shall be the duties, as the king, to declare war, parley with shared adversaries...
fancy that.
there has not been a king since the First Court.
and that's not likely to change.
not likely. Why not?
see, the pirate king is elected by popular vote.
and each pirate only ever votes for himself.
I call for a vote.
I vote for Ammand the corsair.
I vote for capitaine Chevalle, the penniless Frenchman.
sri Sumbhajee votes for Sri Sumbhajee.
mistress Ching.
gentleman Jocard.
Elizabeth Swann. Barbossa.
Vallenueva!
Elizabeth Swann.
what? I know. Curious, isn't it?
vote for me. Vote for me.
what you talking about?
No!
am I to understand that you will not be keeping to the code, then?
very well.
what about you, Captain Swann, king of the Brethren Court?
prepare all floats.
at dawn we're at war.
and so we shall go to war.
what?
you've seen it all, done it all. You survived.
that's the trick, isn't it? To survive?
it's not just about living forever, Jackie.
the trick is living with yourself forever.
how's Mum?
she looks great.
the enemy is here! Let's take them!
abandon ship! Abandon ship!
parley?
you are the cur that lead these wolves to our door.
don't blame Turner. He was merely the tool of your betrayal.
if you wish to see its grand architect, look to your left.
my hands are clean.
figuratively.
my actions were my own and to my own purpose.
Jack had nothing to do with it. Well spoke. Listen to the tool.
will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.
I understand the burden you bear, but I fear that cause is lost.
no cause is lost if there is but one fool left to fight for it.
if Turner wasn't acting on your behalf, then how did he come to give me this?
you made a deal with me, Jack, to deliver all the pirates.
and here they are.
don't be bashful. Step up. Claim your reward.
your debt to me is still to be satisfied.
one hundred years in servitude aboard the Dutchman.
as a start.
that debt was paid, mate, with her help.
but you escaped. Technically.
I propose an exchange.
will leaves with us...
...and you can take Jack.
done.
undone. Done.
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords. You have no right to do so.
king.
as you command, nibs. Blackguard!
if you have something to say, I might be saying something as well.
first to the finish, then?
do you fear death?
you've no idea.
advise your Brethren, you can fight, and all of you will die.
or you can not fight, in which case only most of you will die.
you murdered my father.
he chose his own fate.
and you have chosen yours.
we will fight.
and you will die.
so be it.
king?
of the Brethren Court, courtesy of Jack.
maybe he really does know what he's doing.
Bravo!
you've successfully arrived aboard the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.
look .Oh, yes, mate.
except for this sojourn in the brig, it's utter clockwork.
go away.
what? Back to the Locker? Not without you, Jackie.
stab the heart.
live forever as captain of the Flying Dutchman.
then again...
...if you're in the brig...
...who's to stab the heart?
does seem to put immortality a bit out of reach.
Oh,it's Peanut.
we'll need to use the Black Pearl as a flagship to lead the attack.
Oh, will we now? All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.
Barbossa, you can't release her.
we need to give Jack a chance.
apologies, my majesty.
too long my fate has not been in my own hands.
no longer.
the enemy has opted for oblivion.
ready the fleet.
to your stations. To your stations.
be there some manner of rite or incantation?
Aye.
the items brought together, done.
items to be burned...
...and someone must speak the words:
Calypso, I release you from your human bonds.
is that it?
tis said it must be spoken as if to a lover.
Ooh!
Calypso, I release you from your human bonds!
is that it? No, no, no. He didn't say it right.
he didn't...
you have to say it right.
Calypso...
...I release you from your human bonds.
tia Dalma.
Calypso.
when the Brethren Court imprisoned you, who was it that told them how?
who was it that betrayed you? Name him.
Davy Jones.
this is it! This is it!
Calypso!
I come before you as but a servant, humble and contrite.
I have fulfilled my vow and now ask your favor.
spare myself, my ship, my crew...
...unleash your fury upon those who dare pretend themselves your masters...
is that it?
why, she's no help at all.
what now?
nothing.
our final hope has failed us.
it's not over. There's still a fight to be had.
we've an armada against us, and with the Dutchman, there's no chance.
there's only a fool's chance.
revenge won't bring your father back, Miss Swann, and it's not something I'm intending to die for.
you're right.
then what shall we die for?
you will listen to me.
listen!
the Brethren will still be looking here to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.
and what will they see?
frightened bilge rats? A derelict ship? No.
no, they will see free men and freedom!
and what the enemy will see is the flash of our cannons.
they will hear the ring of our swords, and they will know what we can do.
by the sweat of our brows, and the strength of our backs...
...and the courage of our hearts.
gentlemen...
...hoist the colors.
hoist the colors.
hoist the colors. Hoist the colors!
Aye.
the wind's on our side, boys. That's all we need!
hoist the colors!
we have a favorable wind, sir.
Oh, so we do.
signal Jones to give no quarter.
that should brighten his day.
to arms! We give no quarter!
Calypso.
have you noticed, on top of everything, it's raining?
that's a bad sign.
man the capstan. Raise the main topyard. Keep that powder dry.
Maelstrom!
captain Barbossa!
we need you at the helm.
aye, that be true.
brace up yards, cack-handed apes.
dying is the day worth living for.
veer off!
she'll not harm us.
full-bore and into the abyss.
are you mad?
ha! You afraid to get wet?
she's on our stern and gaining.
more speed! Haul your wind and hold your water.
bow cannons!
blow cannons!
take us out or they'll overbear us.
nay. Further in. We'll cut across to faster waters.
prepare to broadside.
captain the guns. Bear a hand.
muster your courage, men, at the ready.
think like the whelp. Think like the whelp. Think like the whelp.
hinges. Hinges.
think like the whelp.
Half-barrel hinges.
leverage.
wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.
I miss him already. He is quite charming, isn't he?
nobody move.
I dropped my brain.
batten down the hatches!
stand to your guns.
midship cannoneers, sight the masts.
main battery at the ready!
hold there! Wait till we're board-and-board.
fire!
fire! Fire! Fire all!
fire!
fire!
come on, men.
it is too late to alter course now, men.
halt there or we'll shoot.
good one.
I just come to get my effects.
admirable though it may be, why are you here when you could be elsewhere?
someone has to stay and guard the chest.
there's no question, there's a breakdown in military discipline on this vessel.
I blame the fish people.
Oh, so fish people, by dint of being fish people, automatically aren't as disciplined as non-fish people?
seems contributory, is all I'm suggesting.
it's true, if there were no fish people, there'd be no need to guard the chest.
and if there were no chest we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.
prepare to board!
cover!
No!
lookee here, boys, a lost bird.
a lost bird that never learned to fly.
to my great regret.
but...
...never too late to learn, eh?
Whoa!
the chest, hand it over.
I can set you free, mate.
my freedom was forfeit long ago.
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth.
will you marry me?
I don't think now's the best time.
now may be the only time.
I love you.
I've made my choice. What's yours?
Barbossa.
marry us.
I'm a little busy at the moment.
Barbossa, now.
fine, then.
dearly beloved, we be gathered here today...
to nail your gizzards to the mast.
Elizabeth, Swann, do you take me to be your husband?
I do. Great.
will Turner, do you take me...
...to be your wife...
...in sickness and in health...
...with health being the less likely?
I do.
as captain, I now pronounce you...
you may kiss...
you may kiss...
just kiss.
leave it.
you can do nothing without the key.
I already have the key.
no, you don't.
Oh, that key.
No!
Hey. My pistol.
Turner.
fire!
thank you, Jack.
stop! It's me.
it's Will. Your son.
go!
harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.
that's why I brought this.
I'm not going to kill you. I made you a promise.
missed.
did you forget? I'm a heartless wretch.
Ah. Love.
a dreadful bond.
and yet, so easily severed.
tell me, William Turner, do you fear death?
do you?
heady tonic, holding life and death in the palm of one's hand.
you're a cruel man, Jack, Sparrow.
cruel? It's a matter of perspective.
is it?
will?
look at me! Stay with me! You're all right.
William?
my son.
will? Will? Look at me. Look at me!
you will not forestall my judgment.
Calypso.
she's taking us down! Make quick or it's the Locker for us all!
no.
no, no.
No!
[All] Part of the crew, part of the ship, part of the crew.
part of the ship, part of the crew.
don't leave me.
no, no!
I won't leave you.
the Dutchman must have a captain.
hold on.
thank goodness, Jack.
the armada's still out there. The Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard, and I think it's time we embrace that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.
I never actually been one for tradition.
close haul her. Luff the sails and lay her in irons.
belay that, or we'll be a sitting duck.
belay that "belay that.
but the arma... Belay.
the Endeav... Shut it.
what are they waiting for?
he expects us to honor our agreement.
ready guns and gun ports.
it's nothing personal, Jack. It's just good business.
Ah, he survived.
ready on the guns. Guns ready.
full canvas.
aye, full canvas.
orders, sir.
sir!
cap'n.
fire. Fire!
fire! Fire!
fire, all!
orders? Orders, sir?
sir, what do you command?
it's just good business.
abandon ship!
abandon ship! All, abandon ship!
they're turning away!
wind in your sails.
shiver us timbers.
captain Turner!
Mr.Gibbs. Cap'n?
you may throw my hat if you like. Aye, aye, cap'n.
now go and get it.
orders, sir?
you're no longer bound to the Dutchman. You're free.
Aye.
that's a fine thing, but...
...By my reckoning, I still have a debt that has to be paid.
if you'll have me.
on the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.
aye, Captain Turner.
this ship has a purpose again.
and where we are bound...
...he cannot come.
one day ashore, ten years at sea.
that's a steep price for what's been done.
depends on the one day.
your chariot awaits, highness.
the oars are inside.
Mrs.Turner.
goodbye, poppet.
Jack.
it would never have worked out between us.
keep telling yourself that, darling.
once was quite enough.
thank you.
I'm going to need the other shoe.
it's nearly sunset.
it's always belong to you.
will you keep it safe?
Yes.
Yes.
will!
keep a weather eye on the horizon.
granted it tends to list to port, and has been, on occasion, known to frighten young women.
but I promise you, you will not be disappointed.
is that it?
the Black Pearl?
it's not very big.
love, that is a dinghy.
my vessel is magnificent and fierce and huge-ish and...
...gone. Why is it gone?
is that it there?
Yes, it is.
why is it there?
it's much larger up close.
Jack, you promised to take us for a ride.
I was to be given the first ride. What? You?
not what he said, I never!
Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason why my ship is gone?
the ship? We're on the ship.
Jack! The ship's gone!
Really?
ladies! Will you please shut it?
listen to me. Yes, I lied to you.
no, I don't love you.
of course it makes you look fat. I've never been to Brussels.
it is pronounced "egregious.
by the way, no, I've never actually met Pizarro, but I love his pies.
and all of this pales to utter insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is once again gone. Savvy?
take what you can. Give nothing back.
tell me, ladies, what do you know of sea turtles?
sea turtles?
let me tell you the amazing story of Cap...
all men up the ratlines.
all men up the ratlines!
Oh, you want a taste of this?
Oh, You're a good boy! You're Daddy's boy.
Oh, yes, you are. Oh, yes, you are.
sir?
some of the men don't feel entirely settled about leaving Captain Jack behind, again.
again. Is that so?
it would make us feel a whole lot better regarding our fortunes if we could see that item you told us about.
on the charts. Aye.
with our own eyes.
to help put an ease to our burden of guilt, so to speak.
Ah.
feast your eyes upon this, mateys.
there's more than one way to live forever.
gents, I give you the Fountain of Youth.

so... even if Columbus got lost, and wasn't the first discovered America, he is still my hero.
he was really brave to sail a tiny ship over a really big ocean.
and because of him, we got Columbus Day off school.
thank you, Heather. Er... Ronnie?
tell us about your hero.
what is he writing?
hachiko was my grandfather Wilson's dog.
everyone called Hachi a mystery dog, because...
he never knew where it came from.
maybe Hachi escaped from a dog pound, or maybe he jumped out of somebody's car from someplace faraway like Florida or New Jersey.
but no matter how, Hachi was lost.
no matter how it happened, but long time ago, in the town my grandfather lived,
Hachi appeared at the train station.
that's where their story began.
no, no, no, I'll walk. I'll walk.
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.
Hey, buddy, lost?
lost here, buddy.
someone must be looking for you.
this guy was wandering on the platform.
Really? On the platform? - On the platform, yeah.
good thing for you to find him.
Yeah. Well...
tell you what, this is a crate, which was broken. I don't know what was going on, but... - Oh...
someone is gonna be here for him.
Yeah. - So... you just hold him here. You just hold him till they come.
no, I can't. I can't do... I can't do that, Professor.
what? You said that... no one is gonna leave without this.
I know. I know that. I know no one is gonna leave...
he will be back for him. So... er...
you take him with you. And when... anyone shows up about that, I tell them you have.
someone's come to you.
you know, you can't for... really, just, just...
I'm... I'm gonna have to put this here for, like... the whole night if nobody comes.
if they're not here, I'll lock him in here, and he will be safe the night, but...
well, what I can do is to take him to the pound tomorrow.
well, I think it's right to take you home.
you stay with me...
in a warm house...
yeah? OK.
Sh-sh-sh...
all right.
here we come. Sit right here.
sit right here, OK? Yeah, bingo.
OK. Stay, stay... Enjoy yourself. It's OK. Stay.
Hello, handsome.
Hi. - Hi.
how'd it go? - It's great.
good. You miss me? - Not a bit, and you?
no, I think about you want.
I have a little surprise.
Yeah. Well, I have a little surprise for you, too.
come on, we have something to catch up to do. - Yeah.
catching up, catch up.
did you hear something?
well, it was the branch scratching the window.
OK, OK, OK, it's all right. - Parker!
we had an agreement! - I know, I know...
or did you forget? - What? Forget? No, he was... he was...
he was in the train station. I mean... he just got lost.
Carl wanted to send him to the pound tomorrow and I thought...
you just thought you bring him home and talk with me to keep it, right?
no, no, I don't want to keep him, I don't.
tomorrow morning I'm getting up and find out exactly where he got lost, OK?
I promise you I will do that.
all right. This was Luke's stuff.
OK, OK.
OK, here we go... in there.
now, look. What a good stuff here.
it's warm. We got that.
it's very cool.
look at this? This was Luke's favorite.
look, it's your water.
some story you could tell, huh? Good you. Yeah.
OK, buddy.
Oh, that's better.
Bye, buddy.
you know you are the one who should live under the guardians.
of course I wouldn't...
puppy, puppy!
Hey, puppy, puppy, puppy, come on.
that's good. Good, puppy.
dad, I love him.
does he have a name?
Yes, he does. Temporary Guest.
you have to keep him, 'cause the house feels so empty since Luke has gone.
ask your mother.
mom!
yeah?
could you come here, please?
Oh, he likes your music.
honey. - Cate, this is a wonder dog. I absolutely want to keep this dog.
no more dogs. Don't encourage him.
I won't.
you sold me.
dad, he is gonna jump out of that. Here.
Oh yeah, that's very...
try this. Safer?
come on, buddy.
Yeah. Wow...
well, it's good. I like it.
great. So you saw Michael last night?
Yeah, we drove over to the lookout... to look at comets. It was beautiful.
very romantic.
it was.
wow, are you the...
may I help you, pal?
Yeah, yeah. I just found this, er... little guy at the station last night.
can you board him till we find his owner...
board him? I can't board him. Just board him yourself. It's a pound, pal.
but I just found him, what can I do with him?
listen.
it's cute. We help the adoption. But...
we gave them two weeks.
two weeks?
Yeah, we're packed.
excuse me.
I'll call you next week, then. All right. Bye-bye.
Hi, Mary Anne. - How are you doing, Parker?
I'm doing great as long as if I could... ask you for a favor.
sure, anything.
Oh, look at this!
Hey, little one! Hello, hello!
Oh, he is gorgeous! Where do you come from?
well, he... he was wandering on the train station last night... I don't know. It's very strange.
Really? He is adorable!
this one I want to put up. - OK. Fine, fine.
Yeah, window? - Yeah, right over there. Any one of those.
Parker, this dog is just fabulous!
you would be interested with this?
what, puppy?
fine, yeah, puppy like that.
what do you think, Anthony? New rela...
Oh, no! Anthony!
Hey.
good morning, Mr. Professor.
Jess.
one sugar, two cream... Oh, What are you doing with that?
a new friend here, do you want a dog?
I prefer the cash.
he'd be a great guard dog for you, wouldn't he?
guard dog to guard the hot dogs? I don't think so.
ha ha, I don't think so either.
why you want a dog, huh?
everyday you have to walk him, feed him, clean him, pick up their poop.
how many does he gonna have them?
on the house.
you are favorable.
Yeah, right, thank you, Jess.
my pleasure.
Hey, any news?
no, nobody came, nobody showed up, nobody called.
nobody?
strange, really strange.
I'm sorry.
Cate made up some flyers without drama.
come on.
alright, I'll put them up for you.
how sweet you are.
I know. I know.
you really like spin in the bag.
professor, no dogs on the train.
no dogs on the train? - I hope.
OK, hold on for a second. Let me show you something.
we skip the... repeat the first section and go directly to the lyrical section.
okay.
let's try that.
which just mean that you have to build up quicker.
and when we get to the lyrical section, just...
deep breath, deep breath.
hello.
that's great.
do you want a puppy? You want a puppy?
well, let's try again. - Yeah, the start.
this is the only thing left on the crate.
Yamanashi," that's all I can read.
what's that? The part of central Japan.
unordinary dog, Parker.
it's a Akita. - Akita, as they say.
it's a very special breed. - Yeah.
what is that? - Hati.
what? - It's Japanese 8, a number of good fortune.
Ah, good fortune. Oh, very nice.
Hati... Hati, it's a good name, I like that.
it might be born eighth in a litter.
in spiritual significance number 8 which is upper heaven comes out to the earth.
so what do you think, you want him?
me? No. I think he has made a choice.
meaning what?
well, meaning he's your problem, not mine, brother.
you are not a problem, right?
well, whether you found him or he found you?
who's to say it had to be.
it was also said that the shoguns bred Akita for combat and hunting.
I guess it whether kinda a dog royalty.
did Ken give you any ideas for you to find this royal dog at home?
I put up 10 flyers already. There are someone would claim Hati.
who's Hati?
this... It was on the collar. It's a symbol.
you named him?
no, I didn't... - Parker, You want to keep him.
no, I... - You do. You do.
I don't want to keep him, I just...
admit it. You do. You want to keep him.
I didn't even think about it. - Yes.
Hati?
where do you go?
Oh, no.
Oh god... Parker, that's a month of hard work!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I wanna him stay out there all night long, not let him back in, do you hear me?
I hear you!
I hear you!
Hati.
come on, buddy, come on.
Yes, come with me.
let's go.
OK...
I'll find you here.
Yeah. There you are.
your blood line calls back at least 4000 years, maybe much more.
yes? What else we got here?
do you like that?
that's the first partnership between men and animals. It's with you.
did you know about that? Did you know that really?
you did, didn't you? you did.
let's somewhere down now.
it's pretty like a bed, eh?
all right. Stay there. Stay there, okay?
all right. Stay. Stay.
SH... Stay...
at some point he is forcing inside so he don't lean out there and shoot the ball in the right field with the ball they did gave to.
all right, I'll stay a little bit.
excuse me.
you don't need...
I just coming up. - Yeah, yeah, sure.
just one night, one night only, okay?
good boy.
stay there, alright, you will be fine.
you can't believe it. He loves "Yankees."
no.
Yeah, honestly. - Really?
Oh, this gonna be fun.
alright, Hati, this is what we gonna do.
this is a ball. Ball.
throw, you go get it and bring it back, okay?
OK? You ready?
go get. Go get.
no, no, no, the ball.
Hati, Hati! Hati, hey, Hati!

you know, I actually took a guitar lesson when I was a kid.
did you?
Yes, when I was nine or ten years old.
I had to stop probably because my brother slammed my fingers in the car door.
you know, he always said it was an accident.
but after that, I don't know, I stopped practicing.
I wish I hadn't though cause I really...
just I love music. You know, I have so much respect for musicians and people playing instruments.
Michael, do you love my daughter?
Yes, sir... Yes, I do.
Oh, that's good. Cause that's what you want, remember, in the bad days.

OK. - Good.

don't let me distracted again.
OK, OK, are you alright? Are you OK?
he was just distracted. A-ha, OK.
I'm all right, look.
I throw the ball. Just one foot. Go get it, OK?
Really? If I... even if I just toss it right here he's not gonna get it?
ha, you're not?
I doomed.
Fets? - Fetch. Right.
I... I throw, he brings it back. He won't do it.
not Akitas, Parker.
right, they have something against fetching?
no, you wanna a dog to fetch, you get a collie, or you get a spring spaniel.
no, Hachi's fine on me. I'm... I'm OK.
Oh, good. Because Akita has an eye into people like his.
what are they up to?
he comes to the train, because there's special connection.
"hey, buddy, go get the ball!" Why? What are you doing?
well, for fun? For a cookie?
because they make me happy, basically.
they can not be bought.
they are Japanese, not Americans.
if he's gonna fetch, he'd wait for a special reason. - Yeah?
I'll find a reason.

the young soloist steps down stage, sings from No. 1...
and then dancers, of course.
following that, rock, rap, hip hop, jazz and... Hamlet!
then... then of course the entire town is going to rise up, standing for observation. The place is going crazy.
mayor sees you down there, he pulls you up on stage, puts you center stage, and thanks you for making it all possible.

probably you're right.
mom!
Oh, you are home, honey!

Really?
Yes.

I'm gonna be a grandpa. - Yes.
Catie, I can't believe this!
this is terrifically good. I'm so proud of you.
Hi, sweetie.
mom, I'm sorry I'm late. - How are you going?
Oh, what you get? - All kinds of helpful goods for you.
fresh vegetables, raspberries, pita with mare's milk, and sprouts...
when I was carrying you, I'm sending out your father for pizza with red peppers and ate double anchovies for weeks straight.
he couldn't even watch me eat it.
I can't believe you and Dad have been together for 25 years.
and we are together longer than we are apart?
Wow.
dad said after your first date, by the time you got back to the car, he missed you so much and went back for you.
I know. I was watching him from the window.
and when I saw him come up to walk again,
I was runing out of the door and jumped into his arms.
you should have. - I know.
but I always stop to think him too much.
that's true, and you do.
don't do that. - Ok.
OK.
Hey, Hachi! Come on, Hachi, come on! Come on, come on!
look.
come on, come on. Come on with me.
yeah... Come on. Let's go home. Let's go home.
Hey, Mr. Professor.
good night, Parker!

let's go.
Parker?
Parker?
Parker?
gorgeous.
well, something I might be able to do out there.
thank you.
anything else you require, madam?
it depends on what you got.
everything.
everything?
Yeah. Everything. - OK.
you're putting up with me a lot, I know that.
but I never thanked you.
how much I love you.
and I love you.
good. - Yeah.
especially when you don't smell like a dog or a skunk.
which isn't very often actually, so I shouldn't worry about that.
well, it happens a lot...
I love you. - And I love you, too.
I'll call you when I arrive. - Goodbye.
okay, Hachi, come on!
Hachi, come on!

I do not know.
Hachi, you have to come, because I have to go.
it's a work day. Come on, buddy.
come on. I got to go.
love you, honey. - Love you, too. See you tonight.
last chance.
Bye!
Hi, Mary Anne. - Hey, Jess, How are you?
I am going to bring you coffee and donut. - Fine, thank you.
where is Hachi?
Hey, Hachi!
Ah, here it goes.
Oh, I am happy to see you.
do you bring me the ball?
where do they get the ball?
want to play catch? Here, here, come here...
here we go.
go get it.
OK... go get it... go get it.
very good, bring it back!
Oh, that's it! This is what I wanted.
try it again, big one, a bit longer.
OK, go get it. Come on.
good boy.
Oh, yeah! Now bring it back.
OK. Come on, come on, come on...
what a good boy! What a good boy...
Oh, actually a good boy!
you see that?
hmm?
threw the ball, and got it back!
first time, a fetch, a real fetch! Yeah!
Congratulations! - Thank you!
good boy!
okay, I'll go to work. Come on, take the ball. Here we go!
first time!
Hey, first time!
Oh no, no, no, wait, Professor!
I'll instantly make you a coffee, right now! - All right.
I'am sorry, I'am late today.
did you see what he did?
I threw the ball and he brought it back with a fetch.
no, no, no. You keep the ball.
you want me have that?
I can't play now, I gotta go to work.
I gotta go to work.
OK, good ball.

OK, thank you. - You're welcome.
I'll see you at 5. - I will be here.
go home, Hachi! Go home!
alright, come here, come here, come here... Come on...
OK, it's all right.
I'll see you at 5, right?
Yeah, good boy. OK, go home, go...
go...
is that any better that time?
sorry, you remember?
you've been talking about, er, John Philip Suso?
the great march composer at the turn of the century.
he is a... very famous man, but had a huge thing about recording music.
we've never been allowed to have his music to be recorded.
even when... um... Thomas Edison came to him with his brand new invention... the phonograph.
but Edison's didn't care.
he went ahead and secretly recorded his, er...
his marching band and parade.
I guess that must be the very first footleg.
so what do you think about that?
do you think Suso was right?
do you think it's OK now?
what about today's performance?
so you people just walk up to the stage, plugging in your CD player to a marshal stack, and...
that's it? Good enough?
I don't know.
I am a lot older than you, but I... I tend to think that there is element in the music that can not be captured.
life can not be captured.
the human heart can not be captured.
the moment of creation itself is... is fleeding.
Lord!
what's wrong with him?
it looks like a heart attack.
Hey, how is doing?
Hey, Hachi!
good night, Hachi.
Hey, buddy.
you will just go home?
yeah?
Hey, Hachi.
Hey, boy?
not so as he did?
I am sorry, I learn.
Andy! Come to go, sweetheart.
good boy, stay here, okay? I'll be back.
I have said that the soul is not more than the body.
and I said that the body is no more than the soul.
and nothing, not God is greater than one, than one itself is.
I hear and see holy God in every object, yet understand God not at least.
nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.
in the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass.
I find letters from God dropped in the street and everyone has signed by God's mean.
and I leave them where they are.
for I know that wherever I go, others will punctually come.
forever and ever.
look, you don't have to wait anymore.
he is not coming back.
alright, Hachi. You do what you have to do.
come on, buddy, come on, let's go.
come on, buddy, come on.
come on, Hachi! Come on, Hachi!
you'll going to be with us now. Let's go, come on.
we got to go, Ronnie's been waiting.
come on.
let me get that for you, sweety.
come on, Hachi, up, up, up, there we go.
it's a good boy.
watch head, watch head.
good boy.
Hey, this is my guy! Andy? - Yeah?
Hachi!
Hachi!
Andy!
what, dear?
Hachi! Hachi, get back here!
Hachi!
Hachi, come on!
Hachi!
Hachi!
Hey, it's like you got your first visitor.
Hey, there, buddy, come up and try to look at our new home?
we started from the top, where almost everything is ready.
Yeah, but something with a basement do?
cellar has long been ready.
donut with chocolate icing.
no, I do not like chocolate.
Hey, Hachi, what are you doing here?
what, you look at it...
this is where he going for?
I thought he was taken away. - So here it is.
probably hungry, huh? - You're thoughtful, Jess.
Hey, Hachi! Hot dog, boy?
come on, boy, hot dog.
Hey, Hachi! - Maybe you should cook it, Jess.
work it? Is it just special?
come on, come on. Here it is.
here it is, here it is, it is good for you.
come on, it's good.
where did he come from?
just showed up. Come on, boy, eat it.
you'd better be careful, Hachi.
he's got hot dogs that older than you.
hmm, don't listen to him.
Hachi!
Oh, God.
Hi! Oh, God! I was so worried about you...
I need you.
why she just cramps him?
this is professor's daughter. He probably lived with them.
will you come home with me?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, why does she take it!
alright, it's OK.
come on. Come on... - Let's go, buddy.
thank you very much. - Thank you.
that's the best thing.
come on, give me coffee.
Jess, come on, give me coffee.
I think of him, too. Every day.
Hey.
you know we love you, Hachi.
we want you to stay with us.
if you had to go...
that's OK, too.
OK.
goodbye, Hachi.
good afternoon, Hachi.
Hey, Hachi! Here, take this.
don't tell Myra, OK?
good night, Hachi.
Jess, how are you? - Morning - Hello, how are you? - Uh...
lucky, let's go!
come on, sweetie. Hey, Lucky!
Hey, girl! Come on, Lucky! Let's go!
Hey, excuse me, sir. - Uh-huh?
the dog...
yeah?
is uh... is that the dog that I've been hearing so much about?
Uh-hmm.
what's it to you?
Oh, sorry, I am Teddy Bartz.
I work with Moon Saki Column.
Yeah, but then, well, I hear them talking about him on the trains.
sounds like it can make a good story.
it's Boilins, Carl Boilins.
Boilins.
no "y" at the end. - Oh.
I'm the one that found him, handed him over.
Oh yeah?
so, uh... Carl? Where does he live?
well... I'm not really sure.
he... he comes and goes.
nobody bothers about him? - No, we put up with him.
he just does what he is doing.
Hey, mind if I take a picture?
for newspaper.
Oh, I don't mind. Hachi, don't you mind?
thank you very much. It's very nice, very nice.
Hmm... one without. First, please.
without the dog? All right. Stay there.
Hmm... I...
Oh, yeah, all right.
I... I appreciate it. It's very kind of you.
okay, together.
Oh yeah! - Yeah, yeah, yeah!
look there.
Ah, that's...
that's beautiful. Thank you!
Hey, Hachi.
this kiddy, Derry, sent you his lunch money asked me to buy you treats with it.

if it keeps up, I'd open a bank account for you.
just don't say that I'm not giving you enough.
that doggie makes us like a bandit here.
look at this, isn't that cute?
Hey, Hachi.
what are you gonna do with the money? - I am his executive.
would you mind waiting a second, sir?
here you are, Hachi. Here you are.
hungry, uh-huh?
Yes, very cold, must eat.
Jess Jin, I own the hotdog stand.
I'm Ken Fyuts Esi, Professor Wilson's friend.
Mr. Professor?
one sugar, two cream.
so, then you must have read the article.
I did.

Yes, I did. The...

Hi, Hachi.
Hello, Hachi.
Hachi?
Hachi...
Oh, you will see, you are still waiting...

Thanks.
Oh, Hachi...

Yeah. - Yeah.
but good is this here.
Oh, that's me.
I know. I remember.
I remember I was there that day.
I'm pretty sure.
he is so handsome. - Hmm.
Oh, you went to the wedding. - Yeah.
it's right there.
right there.
where did Grandpa find Hachi?
Ronnie, actually, Hachi found your grandfather.
how?
one night your grandfather was coming back from a train, got out of the train station and outside the train station...
Hey, boy.
Hey, come on, let's go.
Hachi!
Hey, boy!
I never met my grandfather.
he died when I was just little.
but, when I hear about him and Hachi,
I feel like I know him.
they taught me the meaning of loyalty and you should never forget anyone that you loved.
that's why Hachi will forever be my hero.
look, he is happy to see somebody.
you walk?
come on, Hachi, let's go.
come on.
I just missed your heart.
you are dead, right now.
I've killed you.
use your hands.
drag the deer back you.
what's wrong?
are you hurt?
you were half asleep.
you must always be ready.
even when you're sleeping.
think on your feet.
adapt... - Or die.
I'll do better next time.
German.
I'll do better next time.
Italian.
I'll do better next time.
Spanish.
Spanish.
did you really want me to snap your neck?
how much did you pull off the deer?
in 120 parts.
200 pounds in total.
I think so.
that explains it.
what?
how you beat me.
you've getting stronger.
I'm glad you didn't snap my neck.
the great blue whale is the largest animal to have ever existed.
its heart weighs 1300 pounds.
and the male has 7 gallons of...
testicles.
the blue whale's music can be heard for over five hundred miles...
a blue whale's tongue weighs over two and a half tons.
what does music feel like?
music - a combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion.
I want to hear it for myself.
we've all we need right here.
it's not enough.
I'm ready.
Papa, I'm ready.
I live in Leipzig German city.

Laika, a mongrel dog from the street of Moscow, was the first animal to orbit the Earth.
she was launched into outer space on the third of November, 1957.
scientists believe humans would be unable to survive the conditions of outer space.
so flights by animals were used as experiments precursory to human missions.
a rocket was not designed to be retrievable, and Laika has always been intended to die.
but she didn't, do she?
they couldn't bring the rocket back, remember?
I remember.
but sometimes I wish you would read it differently.
when a star collapses, the supernova explosion is ten billion times brighter than the other stars.
will you hunt with me?
if you want.
well, it's up to you.
me? - Yes.
I'll stay.
Yes, good.
marissa Wiegler...
come and find me.
you were lucky to have caught that deer.
there was nothing out there today.
the smell's good.
when will it be ready?
soon.
we've picked up an unencrypted signal. One of ours.
when? - 0632 Eastern Standard.
triangulated about 60 miles below the Arctic Circle.
near Kazuma.
we think it is Erik Heller.
Erik Heller? - You're his handler, right?
sure, the name sounds familiar.
fuck Erik.
why now?
how does it look?
good...
almost good.
Erik Heller, recruited in 1991.
formal FSK operative.
he became integral to our counter Intelligence Ops in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
his file ends in '94.
there was no sign of life until April 18, 1996, when his fingerprints were found on a 22 calibre ruger, found beside body of one, Johanna Zadek.
Johanna Zadek, born in 1970, German.
she was spotted and developed by Heller in 1994.
never recruited. - Why was she being developed?
that's not in the file. Let's keep on the past.
Heller is a rogue asset.
I propose we go and pull him out.
we got bigger problems, Marissa.
let Interpol pick him up.
he's no longer our responsibility.
Interpol nabs him, that exposes him to BND, FSB, and France.
do you really want every intelligence agency in Europe scratching at this threat?
Lewis? - I'm sorry, but we need to keep this contained, gentlemen.
keep it small. I've worked with this man.
he knows things I don't think you wanna know.
I appreciate your candor.
what do you need, Lewis?
one man, one-day operation.
tell me again. - Marissa Wiegler.
then? - Postcard.
then? - What?
the address where we meet.
wilhelm Grimm House, Stefan Straβe, 21610559, Berlin, Germany.
then what else? - Adapt or die.
think on your feet... - Even when I'm sleeping.
Papa.
remember what I taught you and you will be fine.
I'll see you there.
Macalahan, do you read me?
Macalahan.
Macalahan, do you read me?
go, go, go.
Erik Heller escaped.
how did that happen?
unclear. We think he got away in the snow storm or...
and something bigger than that I can manage.
one man, one day of operations.
just find him, Lewis.
find him and bring him to me.
there was a kid. Things got out of our control!
Wiegler?
Wiegler, are you there?
where is she now?
Hello, Hanna.
hello.
my name is Dr. Burton. Would you like to talk to me?
I was told by my father to gain the upper hand.
that's very interesting.
what else did your father tell you?
where am I?
you are in holding.
I've never been in a room like this.
must all be very strange for you?
how long have you been in the forest?
Hanna?
are those cameras? - Uhuh.
they're taking our pictures right now, to keep a record.
how does that make you feel?
camera obscure...
it's Latin, for dark chamber.
it was first described by the Arabic scientist Ibn Al-Haytham in the year 1021.
plug the CCTV through to Langley.
Hey, you should have a visual on the psych evaluation there.
can I get you something? What do you like?
music, magazines.
just ask, anything.
I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler.
tell her I'll be there tonight. - I can handle this.
just do what you're told.
John, take a look at this kid's blood sample.
is that right? - Is it?
can't be right. - Got a sample of her hair.
must be contaminated. Run it again.
my name is Marissa Wiegler.
you wanted to speak with me?
you can wait outside.
where am I?
you are in a safe place, sweetie.
where did you meet my father?
Erik.
you mean Erik?
Yes.
I met him by a news kiosk at Alexander Platz. East Berlin.
I met him at a news kiosk, - Alexander Platz... - Say it was raining.
in the rain.
he'd just arrived from Prague.
he'd just arrived from Prague.
you know where your father is?
did he tell you where he was going?
we are worried about him.
it's okay.
agent, keep your distance.
it's okay.
do you want me to give her something?
I think that might be necessary.
abort.
open up.
I repeat, agent, abort!
Wiegler!
Wiegler!
I want everyone here now.
do not let it escape from the gallery.
do you think she got out? - She can't get out.
detail every unit available.
mama.
she will never be yours.
Hey, hello.
don't you speak English?
it's not your fault if you can't.
Emma Ackery couldn't speak English until she was eight, because she was like a refugee or something from Sri Lanka.
but now she's a pop star, in America too.
so don't worry if you can't speak English yet.
who's she?
I found her, she can't speak English.
she's from Sri Lanka.
I'm from Germany.
I live in Leipzig. Population: 0. 7 million peoples.
we live at No. 7 Vicenza Platz.
I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics.
I go to school at The Klaus College Gymnasium.
and my best friends are Rudy Gunter and Clara Scheitz.
they sound fun.
I also have a dog called Trudy.
we had a dog called Vincent, but he went mad and died.
Sophie, come on.
see ya.
Sophie, come on.
I'm Sophie and that is my brother, Miles.
I am...Hanna.
do you need a lift somewhere?
no. I prefer to walk.
suit yourself.
Sophie, come on, we are all waiting for you.
Tacticle says she's in the desert, south east of vessel we're in.
focus all operations on Heller.
are you saying the girl's not of interest to us?
Yes, of course she's of interest, Lewis.
but not an immediate threat to the security of the United States of America.
Erik Heller is the immediate threat. Focus on Heller.
where is your family?
are you Arabic? - I am Moroccan.
Morocco. Capital city: Rabat.
places of interest: Marrakech, Essaouira.
religion: Islam. Language: Arabic.
I like Arabic very much.
it's like Japanese, it's big.
you speak Arabic?
Yes, of course.
where is your family?
I need a room for the night.
can you help me? I have no money.
it's the best we've got.
thank you.
do you have one of these in every room?
all the rooms are the same.
it's electricity.
of course, all mod cons.
I know a little about electricity.
they say Edison invented it.
or was it Franklin?
some American I'm sure.
this is an electrical kettle.
it's for the English.
they like to make their own tea.
what is it?
it's the best we can do.
where do you come from?
the forest.
it's the German girl.
it's Kraut in a big Djellaba.
like quail or lesbo.
I think I'd quite like to be lesbian.
but not one of those fat ones, one who's like, a supermodel.
but who don't hold hands, and I think I'd probably marry a man.
what?
no kiss?
she's a bit old for you, isn't she?
she has male and female genet alias.
and you love her just the way she is.
I like to give people what they want.
Vera, make my friend something sweet.
I'll save it for when I need it.
what do you want, Marissa?
Erik Heller's still alive.
of course.
and the girl.
why are you here precisely?
I need you.
you need me? Little old me! I'm very flattered.
I need your talents, darling.
I need you to do things my agency will not let me do.
stop!
again.
start again.
the devil is in the details, isn't it?
it's the girl or Erik?
she is in Morocco.
it's all in the envelope.
let me worry about Erik.
shall I kill her?
just find her.
Marissa.
did she turn out as you hoped?
better.
once more.
again.
...and gave me lots of advices about how to spend this money do these taxes.
you see even though she is beautiful, she is actually brilliant with money.
get off.
like for one of the anniversary, he said his 15 grand, for a Hermes Kelly bag or a boob job.
now she said she knew that the boob implant will have to be replaced every 10 years.
but that the Hermes Kelly bag never depreciates in value.
that's enough for the boob job.
I mean that's not just common sense.
and that's why I really love her.
mum is against plastic surgery.
I am. - Mum doesn't even wear make-up.
I don't. I think it's dishonest.
this is my face, take it or leave it.
if you study History of Art, Anthropology...
Rachel got a first at Cambridge.
you'll learn that red lipstick mimics arousal and suggests the geography of the labia minora.
puke! - Where as I have a lot of natural red pigments in my lips and so I really don't need it.
Vomitory - Sophie!
it's embarrassing. - Just grow up! All right?
grow up? - Yeah
Oh, because yesterday mum was saying how I shouldn't act beyond my years.
no, it does leave her with mixed messages, darling.
because we're trying to communicate to her how to enjoy childhood.
I just want her to stop saying vomitory, all right?
Oh, it's not funny.
so, Hanna. Hanna?
I'm quite impressed about you traveling around on your own.
my father encourages me to be independent.
you see, that's wonderful.
I was back packing at your age.
and where is he, your father?
I spent a heavenly summer, just island hopping around Greece.
island hopping around Greece!
what? No. It's valuable.
our experience makes us who we are.
isn't that right, kids?
so Hanna, is your mum and dad still together?
my mother is dead.
nice one, dad!
I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my mum when I was very young, so...
it's all right. It happened a long time ago.
Hanna, what did your mum die of?
three bullets.
Oh my god, that's appalling!
combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion.
abnormal.
what happen if it rains?
well, you are going to get wet. Aren't you?
because someone broke the sunroof.
the thing is me and your mother are... - Your mother and I...
the thing is me and your mother, your mother and I are responsible adults... not as you two.
my fungus nail infection's back.
who are you?
what do you want from the girl?
I am her uncle.
we are very concerned about her.
I don't know what you're looking for.
she came, she was nice, she left.
Bingo!
voila!
the van has checked out?
today.
north or south?
the ferry. They caught the ferry to Spain.
can you lend me your pen?
I've contacted Interpol.
on whose authority?
Walt. We can't keep this to ourselves anymore.
were you not listening? - He killed two policemen.
he's reframed the situation. It is out of our control.
then we must regain control, Mr. Lewis.
I am the first and the last person Erik Heller will see.
are we clear?
are we clear?
Mr. Lewis? - Yes, madam.
Oh, my god! What are you doing here?
the sunroof, was it you?
would it be very bad if it was?
you mean you were in the van, the whole time?
my dad would have a heart attack if he found out.
will you have to tell him? - Hanna, you are so mental!
of course I'm not going to tell him.
I think it's brilliant.
have you got anywhere to stay? - No.
Yes, you do. You're staying with me.
I am?
Yeah, obviously.
I'm sneaking you in, on one condition.
what?
these boys. Spanish. Gorgeous.
no, don't look. Don't go all puny about it, like footballers.
haven't got their eyebrows waxed, or anything!
good. - Anyway, we're going out tonight and you have to come.
all right. -God, you're not hard to convince! Perv.
who?
have you got anything to wear?
you can't wear those, you look like some mad German.
are you scared?
of what?
are we going to kiss now?
would you like to?
kissing requires a total of 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
the most important muscle involved is the orbicularis oris muscle, because it is used to pucker the lips.
Hanna, you mentalist!
please tell your friend I wanted just a kiss.
Hanna!
should I let him go? - As opposed to what?
Yes, you should let him go!
I'm going to go now.
okay.
it was nice.
Sophie, is that you?
it is the sandman.
go to sleep.
Oh, my god. You acted like a bandit. It's embarrassing.
like what? - Oh, I can't believe you.
Hello, mama.
I know you're disappointed in me.
I know it. I am very sorry, Mama.
but... But maybe I've found a way to make it better.
I'm in a programme now.
a programme to make babies stronger.
it's an American programme, very scien...
how did you get into my house, Mrs. Wiegler?
I'm looking for Erik.
he said you were dead.
so you've seen him?
he sent word.
where is Hanna?
did you ever have children of your own?
I made certain choices.
then you will never understand what it is like to lose your child, to not know what happened.
the years of waiting, of watching from the window.
and waiting...
waiting...
have you seen her?
Hanna!
can you tell me what she looks like?
like her mother.
Hanna? - Yes.
where do you really come from?
Leipzig. I live in Leipzig.
if we're going to be friends, you're going to have to be honest with me.
those are the rules.
are we friends? - Yes.
I like you.
I'd like to have a friend.
I mean, you're a freak and everything, but I like you.
I like you too. I really do.
but.
there are things I can't tell you.
do you understand? - Yes
actually, no, I don't.
there are peoples that want to harm me.
bad peoples. - I see.
and they won't stop. - Right.
so, for your own safety.
can we still be friends?
I don't know.
I mean I don't really know who you are, do I?
that's just it.
neither do I.
what is it? - It's something about me.
I know what DNA means, but I don't understand the rest of it.
are you sick? - I don't feel sick.
what's wrong with you? - Nothing's wrong with me.
what are you going to do?
I'm going to Berlin.
I have to meet my father at the House of Wilhelm Grimm.
from Grimms fairy tales?
that's right.
if you say so.
did I say the wrong thing again?
keep this.
to remember me.
it's a friendship bracelet.
thank you.
Where's Hanna?
wow, you look rough! Do want some tea?
I had some. Who's Hanna?
the girl we ate dinner with in Morocco.
she's here, or was. She came out with me last night.
how did she get here? Is she with her father?
no, she came on her own.
what?
look, other people have their own style of parenting.
he's promoting independence.
she's like an orphan! Call me conservative.
are you really conservative, darling? - No, I'm not.
I said we'll give her a lift to Lyon.
we are going to Lyon, aren't we?
I found breakfast.
that's gross!
we've got him! We have Heller.
do you read me? Bring him to Wiegler.
she will id an interview.
is that what she said?
confirmed with her two minutes ago.
Marissa, damn it!
I feel so grounded in the countryside.
the city stifles me, emotionally, creatively, spiritually.
places like this bring us closer to God.
God?
well, not any modernistic sense.
buddha, Krishna, the God within.
whatever you believe in.
what do you believe in, Hanna?
nothing.
everything alright?
I think so.
I'm not sure if it's true that the baby can hear me, but at night I feel her.
I hope she hears me.
was it like this for you, mama?
I think I know what she looks like.
I can see her when I close my eyes.
I can hear her inside me. Movings.
do you think is that silly? Oh, I think it's a girl.
I hope so.
Erik ...
what?
Oh for Christ's sake, Lewis.
Hello, Marissa.
I heard you were dead.
did your little girl tell you that?
what are you listening to? - Self help.
are you in need of help?
it's good to hear you.
I didn't imagine we'd have the chance to talk.
you don't have her, do you? You're not that good.
Oh, Erik! You're such a flirt.
tech's on the way.
you were a good agent, Erik.
sad to see you go dumb.
what did I miss?
I couldn't do it anymore.
the things we did.
I... I'm sorry with Johanna.
with all of them. With Hanna.
so, why come back now?
tech guys.
I asked you a question, Erik?
Erik, are you still there?
move. Get up.
shit ... shit ... shit ...
Hanna, I think we're lost.
I have to pull over. - No, don't.
can't see the map.
have we stopped? I need to pee.
don't want you going too far right now, love.
I think you should stay where you are, Sophie.
Hanna, what's going on?
keep calm.
are we are in Lyon? - No, we're not.
whatever you do, don't follow me!
promise not to follow me.
I promise.
thank you for being my friend.
Hanna!
come on, come on!
Silence! Shut up!
Hanna.
definitely odd. Disconnected.
you know, I like to think that I have a rapport with kids.
you know, I get with them.
you know, sir, its days like this that I really hate my job.
Yeah, I'm sure you do.
this is very, very difficult.
but sometimes children are bad people too.
stop crying. - I'm not telling you anything!
do you know this boy? - No!
he knows you. Your friend is in a lot of danger.
I don't know anything!
she said she lived in Leipzig.
she went to The Klaus College Gymnasium.
her friends were Rudy and Gunter
she likes tennis and she has a dog named Trudy.
she lied to you. - Absolutely.
she is not lost.
but she needed taken care of.
I've got something to show you.
a little help from mom. - This is Hanna's mother.
biological mother.
15 years ago, she was shot to death by Hanna's father on a camping trip.
don't you wanna see what's inside?
say "Please." - Please.
you like her, don't you?
it's okay. I won't tell anyone.
she's very pretty.
where is she? - You tell me.
is she in lots of trouble?
the worst kind, sweetheart.
some very bad men are looking for her, and I need to find her. I wanna protect her.
do you want her to get hurt?
no.
she's going to Berlin. To Wilhelm Grimm's house.
to meet her dad.
Hanna. Hanna ... Hanna come, come.
this way.
been waiting for you a long time.
what did Erik told you about me?
wilhelm Grimm's House Stefan Straβe, 21610559, Berlin, Germany.
that's it.
he didn't tell you of my magic.
Klaus, 09/05. Be there Tuesday. Erik.
what day is it? - It's today, my dear.
come, come.
sit.
Oh, you're hungry.
waffles. - May I have one?
an egg? Of course.
you can eat whatever you want, my dear.
my shoe!
Oh, I've almost forgotten.
a present.
for me?
you will need a fresh photograph.
but everything's in order, yes?
why do I need a piece of paper to tell me my name?
not you, not you, my dear.
but everyone else we need paper and computers, so we don't have to ask people their names to look them in the face.
you have a good face.
you look just like your father.
and you walk like him too, uh uh uh.
I don't walk like that.
Yes, you do! You do, my dear! Uh uh.
did you know my mother too?
of course.
she was a singer. A wonderful singer.
do you sing?
Papa. Erik, didn't teach me.
Oh, you poor child.
he has truly limited you from all the wonderful things the world has to offer.
no magic.
no music.
I'll teach you.
is that him?
upstairs with you, my dear. Quickly.
good day.
we're closed, boys and girls.
where is Erik?
he doesn't know much or he is a very good liar.
he knew Johanna.
Yes, of course.
bits and pieces about the programme.
what does he know about the girl?
he thinks Erik's the father.
everybody thinks Erik's the father. - That's precious!
yes? This is Marissa Wiegler.
Walt, I didn't recog...
Lewis is dead.
do you think it's important to tell us?
why didn't you call us yet?
one man, one-day operation.
Yes. Yes. Yes! We all want Lewis.
he was shooting through the door, Walt.
no, I'm not standing down...
no, I'm interest.
well, yes. That is time.
no, listen, Walt.
Heizinger.
so off to grandmother's house, we go.
have you seen her?
Hanna!
sit down.
are you my father?
sit down, Hanna.
are you my father? - Please, sit.
are you?
Hanna, of course I'm your father.
I raised you. - But Marissa said ...
Hanna! - Don't lie to me!
I'm your father. I've been with you your whole life.
treated you like my own flesh and blood.
but I was not your flesh and blood.
I am abnormal? - No!
where was I born?
tell me the truth.
you were born in a research facility.
in rural Poland, Galinki.
what was the research?
they took fertilized embryos and made small changes to them to improve them.
to reduce the capacity for fear, for pity, to increase muscle strength, heightened senses. Anything to make a better soldier.
the perfect soldier.
I've recruited your mother in an abortion clinic.
I've recruited twenty women the same way.
there were other children? - Yes.
when you were two,
marissa Wiegler, she closed the whole programme and all of this research, it was disposed of.
do you understand?
I love you, Hanna. You have to know that.
because I'm a freak?
no.
because you are my child.
where are you going?
stop this.
let me go!
stop this.
Hanna! Hanna, please!
I tried to prepare you for what your life's be.
you didn't prepare me for this.
run!
run!
take it.
that's all you got?
run, pig!
why now, Erik?
kids grow up.
Mr. Grimm!
Mr. Grimm.
Hanna
I'm here, Hanna.
Oh, don't worry sweetheart.
don't! Don't move any closer!
Hanna, I can help you.
please!
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore.
I just wanna talk.
it's over now, Marissa.
let me go.
Hanna!
don't walk away from me, young lady!
I just missed your heart.
this is so good.
I want more.
don't get greedy.
Jeff?
Hayley.
sorry.
I was gonna be, like, so sophisticated when we met.
little hard to do that with your mouth full of... whatever that is.
it's great. It's great. Do you want some?
sure.
yum.
it's, um... kind of what I was thinking.
sorry?
you just don't look like the kind of guy who has to meet girls over the internet.
I think it's better to meet people online first sometimes.
you get to know what they're like inside.
when you work as a photographer you find out real quick, people's faces lie.
does my face lie?
I look at those eyes and I see...
a girl who reads Zadie Smith, who listens to John Mayer and ColdPlay, who loves Monty Python episodes and who, desperately, madly, deeply, wants, needs, longs for... more chocolate.
excellent, excellent judge of character.
can I get two of those truffles and two ganaches?
now what's a ganache?
you don't know what a ganache is?
lucky, you're with a woman of the world to introduce you to these things.
and two chocolate-covered hearts.
and a decaf latte for me.
And? - I'm good.
Yeah, you do appear so.
so what's in the bag?
Oh, you know, just, like, books and stuff.
I figured if you stood me up, then I should have something to read.
well... I couldn't really decide.
I'm reading this book about Jean Seberg.
she's this actress who slept with all the wrong people and ended up killing herself.
don't you do that.
no. I intend to sleep with all the right people.
Plus, I'm reading Romeo and Juliet.
it's a ninth grade book, but I figured I could have it done before the school year starts, so...
doesn't look like Elizabethan tragedy.
no, that's 'cause...
well, my dad... he's letting me audit one of his med school courses, right?
I don't really understand half of it, but I totally love it.
what?
so you go to UCW and you sit in a lecture hall with all these grad students and, what, do they hit on you?
Why? Are you jealous?
just admiring. I didn't know you were interested in that kind of thing.
what?
you thought since we'd been chatting for three weeks that you knew everything about me?
Plus, they wouldn't hit on a 14-year-old girl. They're old enough to be my dad, so...
they're like...
they're bad older. They're... You're not...
I'm so articulate.
sorry. Can I just, like, start over?
no. I get it. I get it. I just thought...
you know, well, you look older than you are.
you certainly act older than you are.
Really?
Yeah. I was expecting someone not as impressive.
me too.
cool shirt.
you want it?
no, I didn't really bring enough bucks, so...
and yet, not actually what I was asking.
sure, I want it.
can I get a green shirt in a small, please?
no. No, no.
I can't let you do that. - What? Because...
because... - What? Because you'd be so indebted to me that you'd have to...
okay. I guess I can let you do that.
you have to model it for me.
conditions. I can't live with all these conditions.
Thanks.
this is so unfair. - What?
this is when things happen, in the middle of the night, by which time I am completely out of the scene.
life as a teenager.
I just hate having to depend Lindsey to drive me everywhere.
you'll be driving before you know it.
in the meantime, I missed Elizabeth Wurtzel speaking at USC and the Goldfrapp concert.
I was at the Goldfrapp concert actually.
shut up. You were? Was it great?
of course it was great. What am I saying?
well, you could judge for yourself.
I got a bootleg MP3. - You have the concert?
just one song. A little louder, please, so the authorities know.
I totally have to hear it.
I'll send it to you.
after you get home, after you get around to it.
good things are worth the wait.
and what have you waited for recently?
I'm gonna have to wait four years for you.
you are just trying to distract me from that MP3.
look, I have to send it.
it's not like I could take you to my house.
that would be a little insane.
true.
okay, now don't peek.
I shoot models for a living.
I've seen it all before.
and you're so sure about that?
I'm thinkin' yeah.
maybe you should peek and make that clerk wonder what's going on over here.
in your dreams, little girl.
little girl?
whatever happened to how mature I was?
is this mature enough for you? - Okay...
keep teasing me like that, you're gonna drive me crazy.
is that so?
okay. All right.
how's this?
nice.
okay.
now, there's three points I have to make.
one: You wouldn't take advantage because you've been seen with me.
and two: It's Goldfrapp.
and three?
well, and three...
you said that it would be insane for me to come over and...
four... Four out of five doctors agree that I am actually insane.
thus, I have to come over in order to be true to myself.
right?
and the fourth reason: This amazing car.
well, in the face of logic like that, I bow down and worship.
bow down?
that's a good idea. What are you waiting for?
worship me.
Yes, oh, royal Thonggirl.
I am not worthy to kiss your feet.
maybe you are.
maybe we should, like, get going.
Yes, oh, magnificent thonggirl.
you wanna call your sister? Tell her where you'll be?
maybe later. I just wanna get in this car.
Wow. So hot.
what's wrong?
well, they teach us "young things"
not to drink anything we haven't mixed ourselves, so...
smart.
come back in the kitchen. I'll pour it again.
no. Come on.
I can whip up something more entertaining than that.
healthy dude, huh?
I try.
figure I'll live as long as I can.
living long is overrated.
what? You don't want to reach a ripe, old age?
for what? When I'm 80, what do I do for fun?
when you're 80 I'll be 98.
right... and useless to me.
what use do you have in mind for me?
I knew there'd be something fun around here.
I mean, other than wa...
I bet these babes got some dirt on you.
those are models.
so why are they on your walls instead of magazine covers?
here, looking at you while you know, you do the most intimate things.
my house is my studio.
when clients come here they're walking into my giant portfolio.
so, what? These were all shot here?
Oh, my God.
okay, you are like a big deal, aren't you?
I get work.
isn't that one of those cameras that gives you the square image?
how do you know that?
I'm a goon. I just, like, read constantly.
you saw all those books in my bag.
you're not reading now.
I'm not, am I?
feels good.
don't fall behind.
we should toast.
Carpe...
omnious.
what's that?
it's my own little toast.
you know carpe diem.
seize the day.
so I figure, carpe omnious.
take it all.
take it all.
so, like, what is it like to look through your lens at some...
beautiful woman who's working so hard to look good for you?
you know these models. They all have handlers.
people to make sure their hair is just right and their makeup is okay and they don't get lost on their way to their next gig.
so you never get to be alone with them?
rarely. - Poor Jeff.
I am compensated for my troubles. Don't worry about me.
but I like worrying about you.
it makes me wonder...
what?
no, no. Forget it.
no, come on.
come on. What's in that insane mind of yours?
okay. We'll have another screwdriver and then maybe I'll tell you.
I'm waiting. - Hold on.
you are not keeping up.
what?
okay, here's where you're supposed to make it easier for me and read my mind.
you're wondering how many models I've done it with.
no.
how many? - None of them.
Oh, get out. - No. They're underage, mostly.
I'd be arrested.
so you're not arrested for photographing them like this?
I'm very aware of the legal boundaries.
I have to be. - Right. Right.
cause secretly... Secretly...
you would like to do them.
no. There's just one that I slept with when we were both younger.
that one?
no out here.
in the bedroom? - No...
what's her name?
Hey.
Janelle.
Yeah. Janelle.
so, what? What? Was she, like, the first big girlfriend or something?
that's right.
learned everything I knew practicing on her.
and that date...
was that the first time that you guys...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
so, what? Where is she now?
she actually signed with Ford right after this shoot.
she really took off. She, um... - Oh, my God.
she is, like, on magazine covers. I know her.
well, like, not personally, obviously.
you are impressive every second.
the models are impressive. I just know how to bring it out.
you still love her.
no.
Ah... yeah.
no. - Yeah!
no. - Really?
no. - Really, really, really?
no.
I still love how simple things were back then but...
you know, l...
I don't want to forget that, but...
we've moved on.
you're Ionely.
no.
I can hear it in your voice.
I'm a big boy.
I guess everyone kind of has a Janelle, right?
I guess.
Hey.
what if you got one of your cameras and we can see what you can bring out in me.
this is what you wanted to ask? - Well, l...
it's not as easy as you think. - Okay.
models don't just pout their lips.
they have to be willing to open up.
they have to show us a little of their soul, their secrets.
and most people only open up from weakness.
nobody wants to see photos of weak people.
we look at great models because they open up...
from a position of...
of, uh, of strength.
they have the strength...
to believe they can do anything, no matter how crazy, or, uh...
are you okay?
let's try something. - Okay.
do me out here.
I shoot everyone in my studio. - Oh, come on.
but I'm not everyone, am I?
clearly not.
come on, Jeff. Shoot me.
come on.
shoot me.
don't do that. - What?
that phony music video crap.
come on.
just be yourself.
just be open.
weren't you just listening to me? - Come on, Jeff.
sit down. - Shoot me.
look at me.
be honest.
would you listen to me? Just sit down.
Jeff, I don't... - Sit down.
J-Jeff, I don't... - Sit down!
are you okay?
I don't feel so good.
did you... Did you call me?
sorry. I was just looking through your medicine cabinet.
okay, boring! No Valley of the Dolls stuff at all.
can't help but wondering why all the lubricants though.
Oh, hey, just... Tell me when you're ready.
take your time.
what did you...
what di... - You remember what I said about not drinking anything you didn't mix yourself?
that's good advice for everyone.
you know what? I'm sorry you were drugged for so long.
I've never really done that before and I swiped this from my dad.
didn't come with directions and it's not like I could just ask him how much to use.
so I probably used too much or those screwdrivers could have affected my judgment, you think?
it's real water.
Scout's honor.
Wha...
why do I get... tied up first if this is how we're gonna play?
Jeff...
play time is over.
now it's time to wake up.
this isn't funny.
is this some... teenage joke?
Teenage.
Yes.
joke?
no.
now let me... - Patience.
let me go. Let me go! - Patience.
let me go! - Patience.
I'm just checking out the side of the house, okay?
you know, I saw this cop show once. It was great.
and the killer, he thought he had cleaned up all the evidence but some of the victim's blood was on his shirt and, yeah, sure, he washed it, but some of the dried up blood got caught in the lint trap, so...
I mean...
anything in here I should know about?
what the fuck are you doing?
that's kind of been my question, Jeff.
what the fuck are you doing, living in a house filled with pictures of half-naked teenage girls?
Oh, none of whom you've ever done it with...
help! Help!
help! He...
there is really no point in me taking any risks, Jeff.
technically, I could let you scream your fucking brains out and no one is going to hear you.
Yeah, I waited till today because Mr. Coughlin is at work, and the Kraskows... they're vacationing in Santa Barbara.
still, I can't have some pedestrian just happening by as you're screaming, so shut up, or next time it's gonna be bleach, okay?
you've been stalking me?
okay.
all right. Let's get this straight.
you have been stalking me.
Yeah. I went into other chat rooms, with different nicknames.
you would get to know each woman...
and then as soon as you found out they were any bit older than me you would just drop them like that.
you took your time sniffing out someone my age.
I didn't talk to the others because they were boring.
you and I connected. - Oh, right.
come on. You think I faked all that?
you know, actually it's kind of funny.
because every time I would mention some obscure singer or band you knew so much about them.
but not right away.
it was, like, a few minutes later.
maybe to give you enough time to look them up on the web?
Jeff...
you used the same phrases about Goldfrapp as they do on Amazon. Com.
busted.
by the way,
I fucking hate... Goldfrapp.
come on.
I wanted to impress you.
I'm not the first guy to do something stupid to impress a girl.
does that deserve being tied up and tortured?
torture?
is this torture to you?
I guess you've never read anything by Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch because this...
this is nothing.
of course you're not the first guy to lie to a girl, Jeff.
the operative word there being "girl."
I mean, you know how old I am.
what makes a kid who's barely past her first period worth all this research?
I mean, you really got to start to wonder when a grown man goes through all this trouble just to charm a girl.
Wow. There's that word again.
girl.
you know, maybe it's this whole camera thing?
cameras... computers.
they let you hide, don't they?
so safe.
I heard how your voice changed when the camera came between us.
my voice changed because I felt sick because you drugged me.
Yeah, you were drugged, all right.
and the drug was sweet little 14-year-old flesh.
look...
I'm a decent guy, ask anyone.
go ahead. Call these models. They'll tell you.
of course they will.
you're not an idiot, Jeff.
you don't piss where you live.
those girls were your work and I, on the other hand was...
your play.
you were coming on to me. - Come on.
that's what they always say.
who? - Who?
the pedophiles!
she was so sexy. She was asking for it.
she was only technically a girl. She acted like a woman.
it's just so easy to blame a kid, isn't it?
just because a girl knows how to imitate a woman does not mean she's ready to do what a woman does.
I mean, you're the grown-up here.
if a kid is experimenting and says something flirtatious, you ignore it.
you don't encourage it.
if a kid says, "Hey, let's make screwdrivers,"
you take the alcohol away and you don't race them to the next drink!
look, look.
I've been Ionely, okay?
that makes me stupid but I am not a pedophile.
I am not Ionely. - This is some horrible mistake.
and not stupid. - Untie me. We'll forget this whole thing.
just untie me now!
I might be a little peeved. So when I am ready,
I'll call a cab and call another one to let you loose.
when will that be? - I'm not sure yet.
don't...
you can save yourself so much time by just dropping that word from your vocabulary.
I'm gonna do what I want, Jeff.
see, a guy as smooth at seducing adolescents as you are and takes those photographs...
I just figure he has something around that he doesn't want seen, and when I find that, then maybe I'll know what I'm dealing with.
what you're dealing with?
I mean, what kind of pedophile are you?
just a voyeur?
again, not a pedophile.
right. You're a photographer.
takes a genius to get paid for what you'd be happy to do for free.
go into the living room.
look in the grey cabinet. Pull out the third drawer down.
you'll see prints of my work for all kinds of environmental groups.
I've done shots of the Yukon Territory, the Utah wilderness,
inuit villages in Alaska...
so what?
you love nature, thus you must be a nice guy?
I'm saying my modeling shots are just part of my portfolio.
I've shot a lot of different subjects, some of it very important work.
and it was so important that you thought, "Well, I can't possibly hang it on the walls of my home."
I need to plaster my house with pictures of underage nymphs and just tuck the nature shots away.
so... a voyeur and a conservationist.
I'm not a voyeur!
not just a voyeur.
sometimes you kick it up a notch to molestation.
I am not a molester! I've no idea who you've confused me with.
sometimes you molest someone and they fight back and you completely lose control and you hurt them.
I have never hurt anyone!
we'll just see, won't we?
those letters are mine.
nothing's yours when you invite a teenager into your home.
don't love her anymore, huh?
that explains why you save these.
I thought about selling them on e-Bay.
excuse me?
sorry. I couldn't hear you. Maybe it was the music or...
I don't know. Maybe it was the bullshit.
all right. Honestly...
some day I thought about sending them to her, reminding her how much of a bitch she was.
a little angry, are we?
she broke your heart and you haven't gotten over it?
you walk into somebody's house, you start looking through their shit...
you're gonna find things that embarrasses them.
it doesn't mean anything.
all right. Okay.
dear Jeff.
you have to stop. I can't go where you wanna take me.
you're just not the person I thought you were.
you don't have to read it. I know what it says.
I bet you do. How many times did you read this?
none of your business.
what kind of person did she find out you were, Jeff?
none of your business.
that kind of depends on how you define business, actually.
so, what? Did you find her?
the girl you wanted? Is this what your work is, some big search?
are you the type of guy who likes to save his outgoing e-mails?
read them over and over again, to think about what you said?
this is weird.
your download manager says you pulled some photos off the net, but... I can't find them.
gosh, that's strange.
Yeah. A smart guy doesn't leave photos on his computer.
cause that's the first place the cops are gonna look.
and then you're... into mementos.
so where do you put the stuff that you pull off the net, hm?
do you have a special little hiding place or something?
I live alone.
why would I need a hiding place?
just what I've been wondering.
I have looked through your whole house.
everything...
and I have found no porn.
I have not found a single bit...
of porn.
guys tend to have porn around don't they?
nothing against it, nothing against them.
it's just the way they're brought up.
seriously, if a guy knows he can get away with it, all guys, they have porn at least somewhere in their crib.
you've done studies on this of course. - Then I was thinking...
that these photos on his wall, maybe those are his porn.
but I bet they're not your stroke shots.
I bet whatever you have is so...
juicy, it needs its own little cubbyhole.
isn't that right, Jeff?
so what's the combination, Jeff?
eat me.
look at how he's sweating.
does this worry you, Jeff?
I'm gonna figure it out, so you might as well just tell me.
I am an honor student.
take your time.
Oh, I will.
believe me, I've got plenty. - No, not much.
aren't mommy and daddy gonna worry if you're not home before dinner?
I'm thinking no.
Oh, is that it?
what? They're too busy to keep track of you, so you reach out to somebody who seems like he might care about you?
and you're so mad because they ignore you?
they've always made the fuss over your older sister because she learned to do everything first?
you're furious with them, but they do love you and they pay for your existence, but you can't let them see any of that anger.
I'm not angry at them. - No, no. Absolutely not.
that'd be too dangerous.
but you are angry, and you gotta let it out somehow.
so you find a guy... an older guy...
maybe he reminds you a little of your dad.
let me guess. I look like him?
you don't look anything like him.
if you say so.
but you gotta let that anger out somehow.
and I seem like a good target... - Will you shut up?
seriously, just shut up!
you know nothing about me.
no, you're right. So sit down and tell me.
we'll talk.
Yeah, right. - We can sit on the sofa.
and I'll call a taxi for you.
if you want, I'll hold you.
if you don't want, I'll keep my distance.
you can let it all out. If you need to cry, if you need to scream.
whatever you need, Hayley.
you wouldn't be mad at me?
I just want you to look at what you're doing.
I just wanna ask, um...
did you... Did you seriously think that that was gonna work?
you're good at what you do, Jeff.
what you do is work with teenage girls, put them at ease so they can trust you with all their secrets.
no, that's not what I was doing.
Janelle's birthday.
Janelle's phone number.
Janelle's phone number backwards.
you're an honor student.
try every possible combination of numbers.
should only take you the rest of the week, if you figure in breaks for meals.
or l...
or I could just try March 19th.
march 19th. First with Janelle.
what's this, Jeff? You are lensman319 after all.
was this the first photo session or the first time you banged her?
or was that the same thing?
hm. What year would that have been?
Nope.
how sentimental you are.
what's so special about these photos?
this is what they make those federal laws for, Jeff.
this is officially sick.
what makes this girl so special?
why does she get to keep her clothes on?
I recognize this girl.
Hayley?
where are you?
Oh, fuck!
welcome back.
I'm sorry to expose you like this.
it's not about sex, although I have to admit...
you are built.
I never touched you.
I was trying to hold you off me while I called the cops.
would you have shown them this?
why do you have a picture of Donna Mauer in your safe?
and have you seen her, because no one else has.
I did meet Donna for coffee.
I took a shot of her to make her happy.
so how happy did you make her?
look at her. She's fully dressed.
you can see the coffee shop behind her.
I never brought her home.
so, what? You just said, "See you later, kid. It's been fun."
you could have thrown this away.
you didn't.
you needed to hang on to it.
you could have talked to the police.
you're right. - Yeah.
or maybe you had something to hide, like the extensive kiddy porn collect...
look. I'm not the monster you think I am.
but okay, I... crossed a line.
just call the cops. I'll turn myself in.
a cute pedophile pleads guilty.
but, oh, it's not his fault.
he's sick. He has an addiction.
I'll do jail. Isn't that what should happen?
Yeah, you might. You might get jail time.
I don't know... Therapy, drugs, group discussions, notifying people when you move into a new house.
how bad is that, really? - It'll ruin my career, my life.
didn't Roman Polanski just win an Oscar?
so why the ice?
I read the psych profile about the person who took Donna Mauer.
said he's a Ioner.
thinks he's pretty damn bright and as powerful as a teenage girl.
he's gonna strike again. Kind of sounds a lot like you.
it's not me!
maybe not, but...
those photos that I found and the way you let me get drunk...
you're a headline waiting to happen.
everybody will be safer if I do a little preventive maintenance.
what the fuck are you doing? - I have to shave you down here.
I can't have any hair on the incision site, right?
what?
I've been going in my dad's medical library at school and, um, well, you said I was pretty bright, right?
I think I'm smart enough to perform a successful castration.
No!
please. - No! Ow!
okay, okay. I guess you're not numb enough yet.
what should we talk about while we're waiting?
dear Janelle. My name is Hayley Stark.
I hope you don't mind me writing you like this.
I met this guy that I think you know... Jeff Kohlver.
he's so cute.
well, he seems to really like me.
he even asked me over to his place to do some photography, and I am so excited about this because, well, for a 14 year old like me, this could be a huge break, you know?
and here I put in a little smiley face icon.
thing is, and I've tried to pretend this isn't the case, but he talks about you a lot, and I have this ooky feeling he's still in love with you.
I'm pretty sweet on him too, but I don't want to go crazy over him if there's some chance that you two might get back together.
so, so, so, so,
I found your e-mail address in his PDA, and I thought I'd just ask.
is this insane?
am I insane?
is Jeff?
and this other girl he talks about all the time.
her name is... Donna Mauer.
do you know anything about her?
I found these photos on his computer but, silly me, I can't figure out how to open them, but I'm attaching them to this note.
are they pictures of you or Donna?
anyhoo, thanks a mil.
your complete honesty will be "mucho" appreciated.
love and peace, Hayley.
I tried to make it sound as innocent and moronic as possible.
how do you think I did?
fine.
guess I'll just send it and that'll be that.
you're getting yourself in terrible trouble.
Oh, and how's that?
if you cut me in any way, you won't forget it.
it changes you when you hurt somebody.
and you speak from experience, I guess.
I've just lived.
unlike you.
the things you do wrong...
they haunt you.
tell me what you're haunted by.
you wanna remember this day when you're with a guy on a date?
or on your wedding night?
cause I promise you, you will.
don't do that to yourself.
Wow.
you know, that is so thoughtful.
you are speaking to me so selflessly.
I mean, you just don't want me to castrate you for my own benefit?
wow, I'm touched.
Jeff.
why don't we imagine someone saying the same thing to you
imagine that, when you downloaded this little girl...
I was sitting by your side saying, "Stop. Don't do that to yourself."
would you have listened?
stop.
don't do that to yourself.
stop.
don't do that to yourself.
stop.
stop.
you are good and numb, aren't you?
fuck off.
your conversational skills are really deteriorating as the day goes on.
seriously. It turns out that castration is the easiest surgical procedure around, and thousands of farm boys across the country guild their own livestock.
so I figure, if they can do it, then I can pull it off, if you know what I mean.
I'm not fucking livestock.
you keep telling yourself that, stud.
help!
help!
look, that wasn't necessary.
you bitch.
no more wiggling.
does your mother know you cut off men's balls?
I've never done it before today, but...
maybe I'll tell her when I get home, see what she says.
Hayley, I knew you needed a science fair project, but really...
so you and your mom are both whacked.
I don't know. That's that whole nature versus nurture question, isn't it?
I don't want to see that. don't ever show me that again.
you scared gigi.
Madison! - want to see again?
no, no thank you. - no, no!
I know I have said this a hundred times,
but I just can't believe my little sister is getting married.
she is.
Sully didn't think you'd bring the cooler.
what?
of course I bring the cooler.
in what universe do I not bring the cooler?
look at them.
you know what I love about those guys?
they bring their own beer?
no.
that they love henry as much as I do.
groom, groom. groom, groom, groom, groom, groom.
Henry dunn.
all tarted up to impress the swells.
there's only one person here I need to impress.
Yep, your father-in-law.
I don't know about daddy dearest,
but there's a smoking hot rich girl checking you out.
come on.
I love you - me? - me.
me. - no, me.
no, you said me. - no, she said me.
Yes, you. - yes.
I knew it. sorry, guys. I win.
who's getting married?
uh, the groom is my best friend from growing up.
you look familiar.
Yeah, i grew up on the island.
right. you're sheriff mills' kid.
what a shame.
all those people. terrible.
I never would have believed something so awful could happen around here.
we're still waiting on people, daddy.
have you seen cousin ben?
I don't want you to worry.
it's my job to make sure everything goes according to plan.
uncle marty!
Henry! my boy!
all right! let's get this party going!
uncle marty. - henry, henry.
Hi, marty.
Oh, come on, trish, it's uncle marty to you.
you're part of the family now.
in fact, for the entire week, it's going to be uncle marty for everyone!
uncle marty, i'm so glad you're here.
Yeah, family's everything.
how did you find a mariachi band in seattle?
you're the only guy who could pull it off.
never mind, i don't want to know.
no, you don't want to know. - come on, i want you to meet my dad.
Oh, he's going to love me.
thought you might never get out of that cab.
well, i needed a moment.
second thoughts? - about going home?
you know, i told him you'd come.
Trish. trish.
I am so excited.
Hi, you look great. - oh, no.
how was your trip from la?
I am feeling a bit shaky from the flight.
have some champagne, abner. you'll feel better.
Oh, my god.
Oh, what do you know? I do feel better.
here's to all of us...
hooking up with all them.
we're still waiting on cousin ben.
he's always late.
he always answers, though.
give him a call again.
voice mail again.
we can wait if you want.
no. no, we should go. - okay.
all right, let's get her going.
all wellingtons on deck. pardon me, sir.
wellingtons, please.
Hi, sweetheart.
Where's henry?
okay, that's everyone.
say cheese. - cheese.
shouldn't you be there?
I don't think that's the plan.
there'll be plenty of photo ops this week.
you didn't think I was going to show, did you?
I knew you were coming.
I didn't. - no?
but I realized if I didn't come home now, i might never.
and that scared me.
you know, it's been seven years, ab, since the murders.
the island's moved on. it feels normal again.
that's why trish and I are getting married there.
you'll see, it's the place we loved as kids.
that would be nice.
Abby so should have been his best man.
you're mixing up best man with best friend.
best friend takes care of the feelings.
best man takes care of the bachelor party.
please tell me it's going to be something seriously debauched.
it's probably your cousin ben.
tell him we can charter a boat for him tomorrow.
hunter jennings
no, it's... it's not him.
come on. you don't know about the murders?
John wakefield-- he killed, like, six people.
how can you not remember?
Chloe has a thing for serial killers.
it's so not a thing.
what set wakefield off? - that's the big mystery.
seven years ago he just showed up on the island and started killing.
he chopped, hung,
and burned anyone that was unlucky enough to get in his way.
you know, um, henry's friend abby?
her mom was one of 'em.
so she was on the island when... - yeah.
so that's why she's...
Abby mills.
Hiya, jimmy.
I knew someday you'd come back to me.
and I knew you'd be here. - oh, yeah? anhow's that?
I could smell you from the mainland.
Oh, so that's how it gonna be, huh?
big city girl now.
so, uh, i've changed, too.
uh, the hat or the gloves?
no, i'm married now.
you are such a liar.
Yeah, yeah, no, i'm kidding. no, but I had you for a second, right, didn't i?
no, i was just feeling pity for the poor girl.
all right, pretend like I didn't.
Hey, abby, welcome home!
it's just a visit.
Hey, abby, there's room.
Oh, thanks. I think I'll walk.
bring the bags to the hotel. - okay.
let's go!
mom?
whoa, it's okay. it's okay.
the killer's dead, abby.
should've cut down that tree a long time ago.
come on, come on. let's get out of here.
look, sooner or later I was gonna walk past that tree, so I thought...
why not get it out of the way?
Yeah. no, great. ease into it.
Hey, maybe we can drop in and say hi to your dad while we're at it.
okay, bad idea.
Henry! henry dunn! you're here!
does maggie know you're coming?
nobody does.
you grew up so beautiful.
just the best week ever. now...
I've kept the afternoon open so that everyone could get settled.
great. - the welcome dinner is tonight at 7: 00.
and, you two, we have a lot of work to do.
your wedding party has the entire inn for the week.
and, since it's the end of season,
you practically have the whole island to yourselves.
Oh, sorry. - sorry.
excuse me. see you at dinner.
did you show trish's niece the bloody finger in the box trick?
I might've had something to do with it.
well, i knew everyone was going to love you.
get in there. - cal!
Oh, this is nice.
wonder what that's about?
sailing?
my bounty is a boundless as the sea my love is deep.
you always said you wanted to sail, so I rented a boat.
I thought maybe we could slip away one day this week.
how do I look?
dangerous.
do you know what I love about you?
you always think of everything.
look at him. he's afraid to get his tighty-whites wet.
you ever see me dressed for the love boat,
you get a harpoon and put me out of my misery.
who did he bring over today?
a wedding party.
Trish wellington is marrying henry dunn.
Really? - yeah.
the princess and the pauper. - yeah.
Henry's okay.
for a guy who only came to the island
for the summers and knew a lot about boats.
tell me his psycho little brother isn't coming.
I don't know. I'll tell you who did come, though.
Abby. - no. don't go back to that, man.
she dumped you.
she didn't even give you a kiss good-bye in the rearview mirror.
that wasn't about me.
Oh, no, of course it wasn't about you.
you know what your problem is? you're too nice.
Hey, al, you need some help?
get over here.
way too nice.
I think something's caught in the rudder.
I think it's just seaweed, al.
okay, so...maybe when she left,
it was because of her mom and the bad stuff that went down.
but in all these years, did she ever call you?
what, are you giving dating advice now?
I got it.
keep it as a souvenir.
Hey, excuse me. that's... that's my bag. thanks.
look at this place.
when you think about it,
you're like something out of a fairy tale.
you washed a millionaire's boats when you were a kid,
and then you grow up to marry his daughter.
I don't think Mr. Wellington considers it much of a fairy tale.
Henry, listen to me. Never...
never let that old man intimidate you. - I won't.
I promise. - Good boy.
now, Henry, tell me about that blond on the boat.
you know the one I'm talking about? You know, the...
Chloe.
yeah?
Chloe.
I have something for you.
Oh, yeah? Is it big?
well, "big" is a relative term, isn't it?
are you going to show me
or are you just going to think about it?
I might just think about it for a bit.
that's my Cal-- always thinking.
question is are you big?
I promised Madison we'd find her a friend to play with.
she's fine. Look at her.
she's having a great time.
Madison, you have one more minute
before you have to get ready for dinner.
did you hear me? One more minute.
Madison?
Jd, you in there?
just want to see if you need anything for tonight.
look, I don't know if you want to hear this or not,
but I'm glad you came.
with mom and dad gone,
you and uncle Marty are the only family I have.
it means a lot.
Hello?
Hello?
look at you! You look amazing!
yeah? - Yeah.
Thanks.
that's good, 'cause... 'cause I've decided.
I'm gonna have fun tonight.
no, no, no, no, no, strike that.
I'm going to have fun this whole week and...
anything you need, I got your back.
you...you don't even have to ask.
have you been drinking?
a little bit.
a little bit?
so Abby seems like a great girl.
all this time, I've heard about "Henry's friend,
now I get it; you're right. She's really sweet.
I know! I told you!
am I the only one who thinks that
men and women can't just be friends?
you've never had a guy who was just a friend?
no.
What?!
you know, now that I think about it,
I did have that one friend that was a guy.
you remember.
that doesn't matter.
remember how he'd go on about his wife, how he loved her...
excuse me.
one second.
Hello, Trish.
hunter...
what are you doing here?
hunter...
I'm getting married.
are you sure?
that guy is my hero.
he's not that great.
Oh, god, here we go.
no, no, no, no, I'm serious.
uncle Marty's, what, 50?
he's not married... - Okay.
no kids...
and here he is trying to tap some hot thing half his age.
come on!
Oh-oh, okay, Oprah, so in, uh,
what world does that make him not a superhero?
as far as I'm concerned, eating ain't cheating.
Oh, my God, tell that to your boyfriend in Seattle.
how's it going?
we were just talking about the groomsmen.
so, you and Henry...
you've been friends for a long time;
you must've hooked up at least once, right?
I...
everybody having fun?
Yeah. Yeah.
has anyone seen Jd?
I'm on it; I'll find him. - No, wait, that's not why I asked.
I know.
go find that fiance of yours,
and let me worry about finding your brother.
Oh, hey, you might want to start...
at the cannery. I'm on it!
we should go to Dad.
he will make Hunter leave.
No!
daddy will just cause a big scene and embarrass henry.
you have to tell Henry.
Henry is the last person I want to know.
I mean, i don't want anything to ruin this wedding.
Trish, he's gonna be your husband.
couples shouldn't have secrets.
Shea, please...
we all know that you live the perfect life, so
don't pass judgment on mine.
Okay...look...
if you have any doubts...about henry...or getting married,
now is the time to speak up.
but I don't.
I love henry.
and I'm going to marry him.
appreciate it.
it means a lot to me.
I'm curious if anybody else had seen you inside.
I did as you asked-- straight to trish.
I don't know if you know how important is that you succeed here.
for her sake.
I just couldn't tell, but, um...
she was definitely surprised.
uh, trish did agree to meet me in the morning, though.
well, that's progress.
I just want you to know, if there's anything you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.
I'm not leaving this island without her.
my daughter's not marrying henry dunn.
Oh, my god!
Abby!
Nikki!
look at you!
coming in here all aphrodite.
you're trying to make us local girls look bad.
Oh, please!
you're gorgeous.
yet you probably forgot that it's boring as hell here,
most of the time.
you looking for someone special?
Yes, but not the fisherman you're so subtly implying.
there's my perp.
any trouble?
JD?
a lamb among lions.
okay, then.
I'm gonna text henry.
make room, you animals.
any of you so much as lay a hand on this flower,
I'll nail your tongue to the bar.
who's up next?
you.
big city girl.
get over here.
who are you calling a big city girl?
that's a pretty dress.
you wearing that for me?
I hope your game is better than your banter.
our cousin ben wellington
Madison!
it's time for bed, sweetie!
Oh, may i?
you know...your daughter and my nephew...
they make a stunning couple, don't you think?
Ah, love.
love's a funny thing, isn't it?
I fail to see your point, mr. dunn.
uncle marty.
Aw, come on, everybody calls me uncle marty.
your point.
well...I'm talking about purpose, y'know?
I'm talking about my true calling in life.
I thought you were in sales.
see, one thing I know for certain,
is that I was put on this earth to protect men like henry
men who deserve true love and happiness-- from men like you.
is that supposed to be some sort of a threat?
threat?
now, come on...
we're just sitting around chatting like a couple of pals, ar't we?
anyway...
pretty soon, you and me...
we're gonna be family.
thanks for the cigar.
my, i thought you'd be better than this.
I'm at an emotional disadvantage.
so they don't have any phones in la, huh?
Nope.
e-mail...
not that I saw.
you telling me you didn't miss me a little bit?
I didn't say that.
then you did miss me.
tell you what
I make this, you have to stop asking me so many questions.
and if you don't?
name it.
really!
you got yourself a deal there, big city girl.
scratch.
double or nothing?
do you mind?
stop being a creep.
what?
I like your tat.
broken hearts.
is he bothering you?
no, shane, i haven't even met the guy.
Oh, we, allow me.
this is jd dunn.
his family used to work summers on the island.
Jd...this is Kelly.
we used to go out.
you like the tattoo?
I did it.
you want to show him the other ones you have?
don't do this.
what?
it's cool.
me and Jd, we're just...catching up.
right?
so, heard you tried to whack yourself again.
now, was that just an attention- getting kind of thing,
or were you really, really sad?
you know what?
you two probably have a lot to talk about,
wt with all the cutting an+++d the suicidal...
that's enough, Shane!
that's enough, shane!
come on, come on!
Hi, Dad.
you okay?
never better.
you're...
probably wondering about the truck.
it seems fine.
that's the...that's the way I feel...
the heater still works.
did you get the cards I sent?
the ones at christmas?
listen, i was...
thinking maybe, now that you're here...
thanks for the ride, dad.
will you unlock the door, please?
I feel like I owe you an apology.
for what?
if I didn't have you out there looking for Jd,
you never would have run into your dad like that.
we both knew that part of me coming home was dealing with my dad.
I feel like I didn't do a very good job
of watching your back tonight.
are you kidding me?
you broke up a bar fight with a pool cue.
maybe if I wasn't playing pool, there wouldn't have been a fight.
come on.
you know Jd. He's gonna do whatever he wants.
I'm just afraid that one of these days he's gonna
do something a whole lot worse than just pick a fight.
maybe,
but...there's a part of him that's very sweet.
Yeah.
who were you playing pool with?
Chloe?
Chloe, darling, when I said swimming, i meant the pool!
what are you doing?
what are you waiting for?
okay.
I want to show you something.
uh-uh, you gotta catch me first.
Chloe...
God...wait
hold on!
Chloe?
honey, did you have a bad dream?
no? What's wrong, then?
did you know people died here?
what?
people were killed on this island.
who told you that?
Madison...
who said that?
my new friend told me.
Chloe?
Oh, come on, Chloe, this isn't fun.
Chloe!
Chloe?
Oh, babe, you should have seen your face!
you jerk!
it was just a joke.
you could've killed me!
look, chloe?
No!
Oh, god...
where is it?
where is it?
Oh, come on!
ruining my night, idiot!
was I loud?
what? no!
Oh, my god, I was loud. - No!
Oh, my god, i was so loud.
no. It's okay. It makes me look really good.
it's okay! It's okay. I love you.
I love you, too.
one sec.
I...will be...right...back.
Hey, honey, I was thinking...
um, maybe we should get separate rooms from now on.
that way, the night of our wedding can be special.
whatever you want, sweetheart.
Hey, is somebody down there?
give me a hand, will you?
I'm stuck.
can you help me here?
Wakefield murders sheriff's wife on killing rampage
and I've come home to Harper's Island.
my best friend is getting married to the girl of his dreams.
but not everything about this trip is a celebration.
seven years ago, I left this place after John Wakefield murdered six people.
my mother was one of them.
everyone else has moved on...
believes the killings are in the past.
but I can't help feel...
... there's more to come.
we gotta get this carcass cleaned up, so you can have your wedding rehearsal.
you're going to get in trouble. - Nobody cares what I do.
you think this will get you noticed?
only one way to find out.
we're done.
I don't wanna see you again.
my instincts have gotten me where I am today.
you married Katherine.
she's cheating on you with Richard.
good afternoon, everybody. I will be conducting the rehearsal.
and now Mr. Wellington will come up and light the unity candle.
can someone get the lights? - I... I got it.
you okay? Are you hurt?
look at me!
what happened?
it's gonna be okay.
wait for me outside, all right?
listen to me, people.
I need you to step outside now.
do not leave the premises, but go outside now.
Henry, take her outside. - Trish, we have to go.
we have to go, honey.
come on.
honey, we gotta go.
all right, listen up, folks. I'm very sorry for your loss.
I know you all have a lot of questions, and I'm gonna work very hard to answer them, but right now, it's very important that you get back to the Candlewick.
if you will help make sure everyone gets back there and stays put,
I'd appreciate it. I'd recommend you all stay together.
this is no time for anyone to be off on their own.
I will be back there to talk to you as soon as I can.
but what the hell was that thing? - I don't know.
a sword, maybe.
is there any chance it could have been a part of the chandelier?
you mean like an accident? - No way.
you see what it did to Trish's dad? Somebody did that on purpose.
dude, that could have been any one of us under that.
I've never seen a dead body before.
I have. - Dude!
it's gonna be okay. - How is it gonna be okay?
Mr. Wellington is dead. Trish is never gonna...
I just wanna go home.
so, I guess the wedding is...
they'll...
probably postpone it or something.
I bet we'll all be on a boat in the morning. - No, if someone did that on purpose...
we should leave here right now.
damn jacket contaminated the crime scene.
to tell you the truth, I'm glad it's there.
I'm in no hurry to see what's under it.
not after finding those pieces of Reverend Fain in the lake like that.
Lord, not another one.
I think this explains why the reverend was killed.
whoever did this probably killed the reverend 'cause he needed the church empty.
this took a long time to set up.
make sure you try and pull prints off of everything.
and I want lots of pictures, too.
we got another killer on this island.
I can tell that. - You know what I mean.
the reverend hacked to pieces, this man nearly split in half.
don't pretend that you don't recognize that weapon.
this has John Wakefield written all over it.
Wakefield is dead.
well, then, somebody is doing one hell of a job imitating him.
guy knew what he was doing.
looks like he rigged a trip wire to the light switch.
flick the switch and... - Fire the head spade.
pretty fancy way to kill somebody.
fancy or random? Could have hit anybody.
the lights were turned off when the unity candles were lit.
you think that the killer knew this?
and who stood where.
somebody wanted Thomas Wellington dead.
here, honey.
this always makes you feel better.
just wanted to see...
I'll be right back.
how's Trish?
she hasn't said a word since we got back.
I don't know what to do.
you don't have to do anything.
just be there.
just everything about this day...
this afternoon, before the rehearsal, JD and I got into a fight.
I told him to leave.
he just smiled and said he had one last "surprise" for me.
you think he did that to Trish's dad?
I was supposed to be getting married.
I'm scared.
I did say we might be becalmed.
Becalmed? - Stranded.
without wind. It's a sailing term.
I thought it meant "relaxed.
if I'd known it would cause you to be late, - I'd never have suggested the voyage. - It's just a rehearsal, it's fine.
I had a lovely time.
we just need to call Trish and tell her we're on our way.
I'll find the pay phone. You just becalm yourself right here.
to love and to destiny.
to love and to destiny!
yo, Earl Grey.
what's going on? Can I get you a drink?
what's the excitement?
crazy story.
you see that couple? Brett and Lisa... they've been on and off for years.
I mean, they fight, break up, get back together.
then, this morning, they were just walking along the beach, and Brett found a diamond ring in the sand.
he took it as a sign, proposed on the spot, and Lisa said yes.
they found a ring?
that's my ring.
it's okay, it's just me.
it's just me. - You broke into my room?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I needed to talk.
does Henry think I killed Wellington?
nobody knows what to think. - This is bad.
it was just a Roman candle firecracker.
my surprise... This thing I told Henry.
I put a Roman candle in the unity candle.
I thought it'd be funny just to piss Henry off.
I need your help.
remember what you said to Shane when he had me tied up, about John Wakefield being alive?
I made that up, trying to help you.
what if you were right?
what if he is alive? - He's not. It was a story.
I think I saw him.
today, outside of the church. - That's impossible. My dad killed him.
look, I know it sounds crazy.
but then I found something.
I can show you.
I didn't kill Wellington.
I'm afraid that no one else is gonna believe me.
please?
look, I need your help.
the sheriff's on his way over to talk to us.
does he know anything?
I'm not sure, but...
before he gets here, let's all just...
take a deep breath.
okay, we're all upset.
but no matter what happens, let's not forget we have each other.
we are a family and we will get through this.
no, we won't.
it may not seem like that right now. - Shut up, Richard.
not... another word.
Madison's trying to sleep.
you lying, cheating son of a bitch!
daddy knew, he knew you betrayed him.
what is she talking about?
he's cheating on you.
with her.
excuse me.
I have some questions to ask about what happened this afternoon.
maybe I should start with you.
it was like the universe was telling me to fish or cut bait.
got down on one knee. It was amazing.
afternoon.
Cal Vandeusen. - How you doing?
I heard the good news.
FELICITATIONS.
there's no easy way to say this, so I'll just...
jump right in.
the ring you found belongs to me.
I lost it a few days ago on the beach.
I sense your skepticism.
prove it," you may say. "Gladly," I retort.
first of all, the diamond is 1. 5 karats.
second, the...
color rating is an "H," which, you might not know, means it's virtually colorless, and, finally, the clarity rating is a VVS1.
it's an impressive statistic that any jeweler could verify, so...
I'm not getting my ring back, am I?
what the hell was that?
Trish, it's Chloe.
I guess I'll try back later.
I got her voice mail again.
what's the matter, sweetie?
you remember our first night here, when you threw my trousers in the ocean?
we've talked about that. - True. However...
when we discussed it, I left out the niggling detail...
that there was a ring in the pocket, that got washed away.
a ring?
for me?
like... the kind of ring you would give someone when you're gonna ask them to ma...
Really?
that is so romantic!
evidently, they agree.
that... dude found the ring and...
proposed then and there.
with the ring you were gonna give me?
I don't think so.
you need to tell me where we're going.
I saw a guy who looked like Wakefield outside the church.
I followed him. I have proof.
come on, he's right up here.
I'll show you.
it's here.
there.
Oh, my God.
is it...?
don't.
I need to see who this was with somebody I could trust.
this doesn't prove anything.
Oh, God, it's Uncle Marty.
Madison's asleep.
I am so...
sorry.
that is not how I wanted you to find out.
I always thought our marriage was a rock.
I mean, I actually thought that he loved me.
so you had no idea?
that's the frightening part.
we had fun together.
great sex.
it's like learning I've been married to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
please tell me Daddy didn't know.
I told Daddy this morning.
so his last day on Earth, he finds out his wife is cheating on him with his daughter's husband.
it's too horrible to think about.
and Daddy was so good to Richard, so generous.
thomas Wellington was a...
difficult man.
you worked for him, what...?
nearly 13 years.
been married to Shea for 12.
how long have you been involved with Katherine Wellington?
six weeks.
it just kind of happened.
fell on her, did you?
I knew what I was doing.
I know it sounds awful, but it was my way of...
getting back at Wellington.
for what?
you'd have to work for him...
to understand.
try me.
I hated him, if that's what you're asking.
his wife feel the same way?
you'd have to ask her yourself.
we don't talk much.
I just...
wanted to humiliate him.
I didn't kill him.
with my daughter Madison.
we spent the day together.
do you know anything about what happened here seven years ago?
the Wakefield murders?
that's right.
just the basics.
guy went on a rampage, killed a bunch of people.
Why?
thanks for talking to me.
appreciate the candor.
where have you been?
what's wrong? - God, Henry.
it's Uncle Marty.
what about him?
I saw him, Henry.
he's dead.
I'm... I'm so sorry.
show me. - No.
show me, I want to see it. I need to know what's happening.
I think Wakefield's back. That's what's happening.
jd was the one who found Uncle Marty.
you did this!
stop it!
you did this! - Henry, please.
stop it!
get off him! Both of you!
you always hated him!
I knew he wouldn't believe me. - Henry, he was as surprised as me.
uncle Marty was strung up in a tree.
it was awful.
it has to be Wakefield.
or a copycat.
there's something you need to see.
how could you?
after everything that I've done for you, this is how you repay me?
Oh, Chloe, "I love you.
Oh, Chloe, you're the only one who makes me feel like a man.
well, you're a liar and a cheat!
who are you? - Who are you, you son of a bitch!
and just so you know...
it isyour baby.
you bastard!
Hey, it's me again, Lucy.
can you call me? I just need to hear your voice and know you're okay.
or a text message or something, okay?
Lucy's, back in Seattle, right, with some dude?
that's what everyone keeps saying, but nobody seems to know for sure.
I left her, like, five messages.
maybe she's having a great time.
you know, with... with that guy. I mean...
love can do that.
I hope so.
you guys heard from Booth yet?
Yeah, he... he had to go home.
he's so lucky not to be here for this.
I hate this island.
and after breakfast? - Dad and I went to the pool.
I wore my blue bathing suit 'cause my green one was still wet.
you like to swim? - Yeah.
but Daddy burns easy, so we couldn't stay long.
and then what?
then, we went to the rec room and played Ping-Pong - until it was time to get ready. - That's a lot of Ping-Pong.
I'm very good.
I can see that.
well, thank you, Madison.
ladies.
honey, are you okay? Do you want to lie down for a little while?
no, thank you... I'm not sleepy.
did I do good? Will Daddy be proud of me?
Why? What do you mean?
I told the sheriff exactly what Daddy told me to say.
does your dad know you've been up here?
I don't understand.
it's like a shrine.
why does he have these?
I don't think my dad believed that Kelly killed herself.
I don't either. I'm telling you, it was Wakefield. He's doing all of this.
no, I think my dad's been tracking a Wakefield copycat for years.
wouldn't it be easier just to ask him?
there have been no murders on this island for seven years.
meanwhile, he's tracking deaths all over the Pacific Northwest that remind him of Wakefield.
so, he's obsessed.
you can't really blame him.
but now there are Wakefield-style murders here on the island.
you're saying, whoever did these... - Also killed Uncle Marty and Mr. Wellington.
but why now?
why, after all these years?
okay, that's creepy.
what was he lying about?
check this out.
points OF SIMILARITY 96. 3% PROBABILITY WAKEFIELD 6/29/06
this is impossible. - This is from the summer.
what if my dad's not tracking a copycat?
what if he's tracking Wakefield?
you're sure... no boats have left?
well, tell the harbormaster...
keep an eye out. Anybody comes or goes, I want to know.
there's another body, Dad.
it's my Uncle Marty.
where? - The woods off of East Road.
I'll get right on it. I'll send a deputy out there now.
he was cut in two, hanging in a tree.
sound familiar?
what's your point, JD? - His point is, my uncle might still be breathing if you'd have told us Wakefield was alive.
and so would Kelly Seaver. - John Wakefield is dead.
I shot and killed him seven years ago. You know that.
you went into my...
there's a copycat.
I thought that man might be him.
I don't believe you.
there's a way to find out the truth. - What are you talking about?
if Wakefield is dead and buried, we can prove it.
we'll dig him up. - We're not digging up anybody.
this day's hard enough without this kind of behavior.
Yeah, you'd like that. But I think Wakefield is still alive.
I bet, if I dug up that grave, I'd find an empty box.
should we find out once and for all who the real liar around here is?
I've heard enough from you.
you should have never left the hotel in the first place, let alone pry into my office.
I'm digging up Wakefield...
with or without your permission.
I'm sorry, JD. There's too much at stake here to let you interfere with my investigation. You two, get inside.
consider it a time out.
was it worth it, Sheriff?
pretending that Wakefield was dead so that you could be a hero?
where were you this morning, JD, when that contraption was set up that killed Mr. Wellington?
odd coincidence, isn't it?
you finding your uncle hanging, just like Kelly Seaver?
you being the last one to see her and all.
I liked Kelly.
you're locking up the wrong guy. Wakefield's still out there!
dad, I need to know the truth.
I'm getting you off this island tomorrow.
it's open.
I wasn't expecting you.
I saw your face...
after my father...
I could tell that you were upset.
what do you want?
I loved your father.
I have done some foolish things, but I wouldn't kill him.
then why did Richard lie about where he was this morning?
I don't know.
he told Madison to lie to the sheriff, say that he was with her.
well, he wasn't with me, if that's what you're asking.
well, then, where was he?
my dad's lying about Wakefield.
I can feel it.
I know.
did you see how he reacted when JD talked about digging up the grave?
John Wakefield murdered my mother, ruined my life.
if my dad's been lying all these years, if he didn't kill Wakefield, I need to know.
the grave.
that's the only way.
... you tell me, all right... because that was amazing.
well, I do get away with a lot of things. - Yeah...
thank God you're okay.
why wouldn't I be okay?
that's dreadful.
sounds like it could have been any of you.
that's what I said.
are you sure it was a head spade?
Oh, here we go. - That's not why I asked.
remember on the scavenger hunt?
there was a head spade missing from the Maritime Museum.
God, this is terrible.
the sheriff doesn't want anyone leaving until he talks to us all.
nobody's going anywhere.
does he suspect someone in the wedding party?
well, Maybe keeping us all cooped up here isn't just for our protection.
I never thought of it like that.
well, I'm not sleeping tonight.
richard would fantasize about it...
thomas dying.
how he would...
take over the company and run it like it should be run.
any specific threats?
no, just...
jokes.
he didn't really mean it. - Can you just show him the articles that you found?
richard left his briefcase in my room yesterday.
it's where he keeps the things we use.
I found these inside.
did Richard talk much about John Wakefield?
never.
that's why I didn't think anything of it until today.
thank you, Mrs. Wellington.
he used Wakefield as a cover to kill my father, didn't he?
I don't know, and until I do, I need you to remain calm and to keep this to yourself.
both of you.
how'd you know I was in here? - I hear things.
can I try?
how'd you get the key?
Maggie keeps it in a drawer.
nobody pays attention to kids.
some people think my dad killed my grandpa.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I...I'll see you later. - You promise?
I expected to find JD here.
didn't think I'd see you two.
I thought you locked him up. - Somebody let him out.
I'm sorry, Dad.
but I need to know if there's a body in there.
I won't stop you.
I've thought there was a Wakefield copycat for years. Just...
never imagined he'd come to the island.
could that be who JD saw outside the church?
maybe... or he didn't see anybody.
that could have been a lie.
then why come to me? Why take me to see Uncle Marty?
so he'd look innocent.
I don't know...
well, whoever's committing these murders...
I think they're pretending to be Wakefield to hide their true motive.
I'm sorry I went through your things.
your mother was a snoop.
runs in the blood.
I shouldn't have doubted you.
I gave you a lot of reason.
I sent you away after your mother died, and I know that hurt you... a lot.
but you have to understand that...
it wasn't because I didn't want you there.
it was because I didn't want you to see me like that broken weak.
don't you think I was feeling the same way?
and those things I said to you back then...
about your mother, that was in a moment of anger.
will you forgive me?
thank you.
well, we need to finish up here and then...
we'll get you two back to the Candlewick and then, tomorrow...
we'll send you all home.
what about JD? - I'm sorry, Henry, but...
I'm going to have to bring him in.
can you come in here, please?
What'd you do with the ring?
the ring.
not to worry, it's safe and sound.
it's so romantic
that couple finding it on the beach and proposing on the spot like that.
becalm yourself, my dear.
I know you want me to be more impetuous.
about that...
I'm sorry I've been so critical.
I think you scare me sometimes
that you care enough to think of everything.
it's because I adore you.
but the ring...
is actually the one thing I hadn't thought through.
I don't want to disappoint you, but I'm not going to propose to you on the same day Trish lost her father.
but you are going to?
of course I am.
I'm crazy for you.
just not today.
I have not been charged with anything, but I am not saying another word without you present.
the sheriff is going to be coming back and I will refer him to your office.
more importantly, I don't know what Shea is going to do.
she's pretty pissed.
no, I don't care about the money.
but I want you to fight for shared...
Harry, take my waist.
what? - Now!
are you ready?
move your body like a hairy troll
learning to rock and roll
spin around like a crazy elf
dancing by himself
boogie down like a unicorn
no stopping till the break of dawn
put your hands up in the air
like an ogre who just don't care
can you dance like a Hippogriff?
ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?
I don't think it was the books that had him going to the library.
may I have your arm?
arm. Leg. I'm yours.
hot, isn't it?
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks. Would you care to join us?
no, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.
he's a Durmstrang. You're fraternizing with the enemy.
the enemy? Who was it wanting his autograph?
besides, the whole point of the tournament...
...is international magical cooperation...
...to make friends.
I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
are you going to ask me to dance or not?
no.
he's using you. - How dare you?!
besides, I can take care of myself. - I doubt it. He's way too old.
What?! What? That's what you think? - Yeah, that's what I think.
you know the solution then, don't you?
go on. - Next time there's a ball...
...pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does!
and not as a last resort.
well, that's... I mean, that's just completely off the point.
Harry.
where have you been?
never mind! Off to bed, both of you.
they get scary when they get older. - Ron, you spoiled everything!
what's this about?
no, don't let
this magic die
the answer's there
let me see it again.
Yes, the time is close now.
Harry, at last!
step aside, wormtail, so I can give our guest a proper greeting.
you all right, Harry?
I just got in.
me.
Harry, you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.
the task is two days from now. - Really? I had no idea.
I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
wouldn't know. We don't actually talk about the tournament.
actually, we don't really talk at all. Viktor's more of a physical being.
I just mean he's not particularly loquacious.
mostly, he watches me study.
it's a bit annoying, actually.
you are trying to figure this egg out, aren't you?
what's that supposed to mean?
it just means these tasks are designed to test you...
...in the most brutal way. They're almost cruel.
and...
...l'm scared for you.
you got by the dragons mostly on nerve.
I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
Hey, Potter!
Potter! - Cedric.
How...? How are you?
spectacular.
I realize I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.
forget it. I'm sure you would've done the same for me.
exactly.
you know the Prefects' bathroom on the fifth floor?
it's not a bad place for a bath.
just take your egg...
...and mull things over in the hot water.
I must be out of my mind.
I'm definitely out of my mind.
I'd try putting it in the water if I were you.
myrtle!
Hello, Harry.
long time no see.
I was circling a blocked drain the other day...
...and could swear I saw a bit of Polyjuice Potion.
not being a bad boy again, are you, Harry?
Polyjuice Potion?
kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say, "Try putting it in the water"?
that's what he did.
the other boy...
...the handsome one...
...Cedric.
well, go on. Open it.
come seek us where our voices sound
we cannot sing above the ground
an hour long you'll have to look
to recover what we took
Myrtle...
...there aren't merpeople in the Black Lake, are there?
very good.
it took Cedric ages to riddle it out.
almost all the bubbles were gone.
Harry, tell me again.
come seek us where our voices sound.
the Black Lake, that's obvious.
an hour long you'll have to look.
again, obvious. Though, admittedly, potentially problematic.
potentially problematic"?
when's the last time you held your breath underwater for an hour, Hermione?
look, Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.
hate to break up the skull session.
professor McGonagall wants you in her office.
not you, Potter, just Weasley and Granger.
but, sir, the second task is only hours away, and...
exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now...
...and could do with a good night's sleep.
go. Now!
Longbottom!
why don't you help Potter put his books back.
you know, if you're interested in plants...
...you'd be better off with Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.
do you know there's a wizard in Nepal who's growing gravity-resistant trees?
Neville, no offense, but I really don't care...about plants.
now, if there's...
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour...
...then great. But otherwise...
I don't know about a turnip. But you could always use gillyweed.
any bets? Any bets? - Come on, place your bets!
step up, mates! Don't be shy.
three lads. - One lady.
four go down. - But do four come up?
don't be so mean.
any bets? - Fleur's 10-1.
you're sure about this, Neville? - Absolutely.
for an hour? - Most likely.
most likely?
well, there is some debate among herbologists...
...as to the effects of fresh water versus salt water...
you're telling me this now? You must be joking!
I just wanted to help.
well, that makes you a right sight better than Ron and Hermione.
where are they anyway?
you seem a little tense, Harry. - Do I?
welcome to the second task.
last night, something was stolen from each of our champions.
a treasure of sorts.
these four treasures, one for each champion...
...now lie on the bottom of the Black Lake.
in order to win...
...each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface.
simple enough, except for this: - Put that in your mouth.
they will have but one hour to do so, and one hour only.
after that, they'll be on their own. No magic will save them.
you may begin at the sound of the cannon.
what's the matter with him? - I don't know, I can't see him.
Oh, my God. I've killed Harry Potter.
Yeah!
what?
the Beauxbatons champion, Miss Delacour...
...has unfortunately been forced to retire...
...so she will take no further part in this task.
but she's my friend too!
only one!
let's get down below.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
Yes!
Harry!
he's all right.
he's all right. Barty!
go get him another towel. - I want all the judges over here now!
you saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save.
my little sister.
thank you.
and you! You helped.
well, yeah, a bit.
Harry! - Hermione!
are you all right? You must be freezing.
personally, I think you behaved admirably.
I finished last, Hermione.
next to last. Fleur never got past the Grindylows.
Krum! Krum! Krum!
come on! Come on! - Attention!
attention!
the winner is Mr. Diggory...
...who showed innate command of the Bubble-Head charm.
however, seeing as Mr. Potter would have finished first...
...had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...
...but the others as well, we've agreed to award him...
...second place...
second place! - Well done!
...for outstanding moral fiber!
Yes!
right on. - All that moral fiber, eh?
it's great. - Moral fiber?
blimey. Even when you go wrong, it turns out right.
Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber. - Congratulations, Potter.
a fine achievement. - Thank you.
well done, boy.
see you at Hagrid's, Harry. - I'm sorry we haven't spoken.
after all, your story is one I've heard so many times.
quite remarkable, really. Tragic, of course...
...to lose one's family.
never whole again, are we?
still, life goes on...
...and here we stand.
I'm sure your parents would be very proud of you today, Potter.
Bartemius!
not trying to lure Potter into one of the Ministry's summer internships, are we?
the last boy who went into the Department of Mysteries never came out!
and they say I'm mad.
now, I remember... I remember when I first met you all.
biggest bunch of misfits I ever set eyes on.
suppose you remind me of meself a little.
and here we all are, four years later. - We're still a bunch of misfits.
well, maybe, but we've all got each other.
and Harry, of course.
soon to be the youngest Triwizard champion there's ever been!
Hooray!
Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts
teach us something, please
Mr. Crouch?
a man has died here, Fudge. And he won't be the last. You must take action.
I will not.
in times like these, the wizard world looks to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!
then for once show them some!
the Triwizard Tournament will not be canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!
a true leader does what is right, no matter what others think.
what did you say to me? - Excuse me, gentlemen.
it may interest you to know this conversation is no longer private.
Oh, Harry!
Harry, how good to see you again.
I can come back later, professor.
not necessary, Harry. The minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment.
minister, after you.
there you are. Your hat.
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in a little Licorice Snap in my absence.
but I have to warn you, they're a wee bit sharp.
professor?
professor. - Yeah.
igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request...
...to present evidence to this council.
should your testimony prove consequential...
...council may be prepared to order your immediate release.
until such time, you remain in the eyes of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.
do you accept these terms?
I do, sir. - And what do you wish to present?
I have names, sir.
there was Rosier, Evan Rosier.
rosier is dead. - He took a piece of me with him...
...though, didn't he? - I didn't know.
if that is all the witness has to offer... - No, no, no.
there was Rookwood! He was a spy.
Augustus Rookwood? Of the Department of Mysteries?
Yeah, the same.
he passed information to You-Know-who from inside the Ministry itself.
very well. Council will deliberate.
in the meantime, you will return to Azkaban.
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more! What about Snape? Severus Snape?
as the council is aware, I've given evidence on this matter.
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...
...turned spy for us at great personal risk. - It's a lie!
today he's no more a Death Eater than I am. - Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!
Silence!
unless the witness possesses any genuine name of consequence...
...this session is now concluded.
Oh, no, no, no.
I've heard about one more.
what's that? - The name.
yes? - I know for a fact...
...this person took part in the capture...
...and, by means of the cruciatus curse...
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom and his wife!
the name. Give me the wretched name!
Barty Crouch......
...Junior.
hold him down!
get your filthy hands off me, you pathetic little men!
Hello, Father.
you are no son of mine.
curiosity is not a sin, Harry. But you should exercise caution.
it's a Pensieve.
very useful if, like me, you find your mind a wee bit stretched.
it allows me to see once more things I've already seen.
you see, Harry, I have searched and searched for something...
...some small detail...
...something I might have overlooked...
...something that would explain why these terrible things have happened.
every time I get close to an answer, it slips away.
it's maddening.
sir? Mr. Crouch's son.
what exactly happened to him?
he was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it.
but he had no choice. The evidence was overwhelming.
why do you ask? - It's just that I...
I had a dream about him.
it was in the summer, before school.
in the dream, I was in a house.
and voldemort was there, only he wasn't quite human.
and Wormtail was there too. And Mr. Crouch's son.
have there been others like this dream? - Yes.
always the same one.
sir, these dreams...
...what I see, you don't think it's actually happening, do you?
I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams, Harry.
I think it's best if you simply...
...cast them away.
it's a sign, Severus. You know what it means as well as I.
Potter!
what's your hurry?
congratulations, your performance in the Black Lake was inspiring.
Gillyweed, am I correct?
Yes, sir.
ingenious.
a rather rare herb, gillyweed.
not something found in your everyday garden.
nor is this.
know what it is?
bubble juice, sir?
Veritaserum.
three drops of this and You-Know-who himself would spill his darkest secrets.
the use of it on a student is, regrettably, forbidden. However...
...should you ever steal from my personal stores again...
...my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice.
I haven't stolen anything. - Don't lie to me.
gillyweed may be innocuous, but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?
you and your little friends are brewing Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...
...l'm going to find out why!
Yeah! - Yeah!
Sonorus!
earlier today, Professor Moody placed the Triwizard cup deep within the maze.
only he knows its exact position. Now, as Mr. Diggory...
...and Mr. Potter...
...are tied for first position...
...they will be the first to enter the maze, followed by Mr. Krum...
...and Miss Delacour. - Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!
the first person to touch the cup will be the winner!
I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter.
should, at any point, a contestant wish to withdraw from the task...
...he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands.
contestants! Gather around. Quickly!
in the maze, you'll find no dragons or creatures of the deep.
instead, you'll face something even more challenging.
you see, people change in the maze.
Oh, find the cup if you can.
but be very wary, you could just lose yourselves along the way.
champions, prepare yourselves!
good luck.
my boy. - See you later, Dad.
on the count of three. One...
fleur?
Fleur.
Periculum!
get down!
get down!
Expelliarmus!
no, don't! Stop! He's bewitched, Cedric!
get off me! - He's bewitched!
Yes.
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Harry!
Reducto!
Thanks. - No problem.
you know, for a moment there, I thought you were gonna let it get me.
for a moment, so did I.
some game, huh?
some game.
go!
go on, take it. You saved me, take it!
together. One, two... - Two...
...three! ...three!
you okay? - Yeah. You?
where are we?
I've been here before.
it's a Portkey.
Harry, the cup is a Portkey. - I've been here before, in a dream.
Cedric! We have to get back to the cup. Now!
what are you talking about?
Harry! What is it? - Get back to the cup!
who are you? What do you want? - Kill the spare.
Avada Kedavra! - No! Cedric!
do it! Now!
bone of the father...
...unwillingly given.
flesh of the servant...
...willingly sacrificed.
and blood of the enemy...
...forcibly taken.
the Dark Lord shall rise...again.
my wand, wormtail.
hold out your arm.
master.
thank you, master.
the other arm, wormtail.
welcome, my friends.
thirteen years it's been, and yet...
...Here you stand before me as though it were only yesterday.
I confess myself...
...disappointed.
not one of you tried to find me.
Crabbe! Macnair!
Goyle!
not even you...
...Lucius.
my Lord, had I detected any sign, a whisper of your whereabouts...
there were signs, my slippery friend. And more than whispers.
I assure you, my Lord, I have never renounced the old ways.
the face I have been obliged to present each day since your absence...
...that is my true mask.
I returned.
out of fear, not loyalty.
still, you have proved yourself useful these past few months, wormtail.
thank you, master.
thank you.
such a handsome boy. - Don't touch him!
Harry.
I'd almost forgotten you were here.
standing on the bones of my father. Yeah.
I'd introduce you...
...but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days.
the boy who lived.
how lies have fed your legend, Harry.
shall I reveal what really happened that night 13 years ago?
shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers?
Yes, shall I?
it was love.
you see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son...
...she provided the ultimate protection.
I could not touch him.
it was old magic.
something I should have foreseen.
but no matter, no matter.
things have changed.
I can touch you...
;;; now;
Yeah.
astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do, eh, Harry?
pick up your wand, Potter.
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!
you've been taught how to duel, I presume, yes?
first, we bow to each other.
come on, now, Harry. The niceties must be observed.
Dumbledore wouldn't want you to forget your manners, would he?
I said, bow.
that's better. And now... - No.
Crucio!
Crucio!
attaboy, Harry.
your parents would be proud.
especially your filthy Muggle mother.
Expelliar...
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.
I'm going to destroy you.
after tonight, no one will ever again question my powers.
after tonight, if they speak of you...
...they'll speak only of how you...
...begged for death.
and I, being a merciful Lord...
...obliged.
get up!
don't you turn your back on me, Harry Potter!
I want you to look at me when I kill you!
I want to see the light leave your eyes!
have it your way.
Expelliarmus! - Avada Kedavra!
do nothing! He's mine to finish!
he's mine!
Harry, when the connection is broken, you must get to the Portkey.
we can linger for a moment to give you some time...
...but only a moment. Do you understand?
Harry, take my body back, will you?
take my body back to my father.
let go.
sweetheart, you're ready.
let go! Let go!
Accio!
No!
he did it!
Harry!
Harry!
No! No! No, don't!
for God's sake, Dumbledore, what's happened?
he's back. He's back.
Voldemort's back.
Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back.
I couldn't leave him, not there.
it's all right, Harry. It's all right.
he's home. You both are.
keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed.
the body must be moved, Dumbledore. There are too many people.
let me through.
let me through!
let me through!
that's my son!
that's my boy!
it's my boy!
come on. Get up. Easy, easy! - No.
this is not where you want to be right now. Come on.
No!
it's all right, I got you.
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.
No!
No!
are you all right, Potter?
does it hurt? That?
not so much now.
perhaps I'd better take a look at it.
the cup was a Portkey.
someone had bewitched it.
what was it like?
what was he like? - Who?
the Dark Lord.
what was it like to stand in his presence?
I don't know.
it was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams...
...into one of my nightmares.
were there others?
in the graveyard, were there others?
I...
I don't think I said anything about a graveyard, professor.
marvelous creatures, dragons, aren't they?
did you think that miserable oaf would've led you into the woods...if I hadn't suggested it?
do you think cedric Diggory would've told you to open the egg underwater...
...if I hadn't told him first myself?
did you think Neville Longbottom, the witless wonder...could've provided you with gillyweed if I hadn't given him the book...that led him straight to it?
it was you from the beginning. You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.
you bewitched Krum, but you... - "But... But...
you won because I made it so, Potter.
you ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so.
and now the deed is done.
the blood that runs through these veins runs within the Dark Lord.
imagine how he will reward me when he learns...
...that I have once and for all...
...silenced the great Harry Potter.
Expelliarmus!
Severus.
that's it, take it.
do you know who I am? - Albus Dumbledore.
are you Alastor Moody? Are you? - No.
is he in this room? Is he in this room?
Harry, away from there!
you all right, Alastor? - I'm sorry, Albus.
that's Moody. But then who's...?
Polyjuice Potion.
now we know who's been stealing from your stores, Severus.
we'll get you up in a minute.
Harry!
Barty crouch Junior.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
your arm, Harry.
you know what this means, don't you?
he's back.
lord Voldemort has returned.
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.
send an owl to Azkaban. I think they'll find they're missing a prisoner.
I'll be welcomed back like a hero. - Perhaps.
personally, I've never had much time for heroes.
today, we acknowledge...
...a really terrible loss.
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...
...exceptionally hard-working...
...infinitely fair-minded...
...and, most importantly...
...a fierce, fierce friend.
now, I think, therefore, you have the right to know exactly how he died.
you see...
...cedric Diggory was murdered...
...By Lord Voldemort!
the Ministry of Magic does not wish me to tell you this.
but not to do so, I think, would be an insult to his memory.
now, the pain...
...we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me...
...and reminds us...
...that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues...
...our hearts beat as one.
in light of recent events...
...the bonds of friendship we've made this year will be more important than ever.
remember that, and cedric Diggory will not have died in vain.
you remember that...
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...
...kind and honest...
...and brave and true, right to the very end.
I never liked these curtains.
set them on fire in my fourth year.
by accident, of course.
I put you in terrible danger this year, Harry. I'm sorry.
professor...
...when I was in the graveyard, there was a moment...
...when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
priori Incantatem.
you saw your parents that night, didn't you?
they reappeared.
no spell can reawaken the dead, Harry. I trust you know that.
dark and difficult times lie ahead.
soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy.
but remember this:
you have friends here.
you're not alone.
Hermione.
this is for you.
write to me. Promise.
Bye.
au revoir, Ron.
do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
no. - No.
no, I didn't think so. Oh, well. What's life without a few dragons?
everything's going to change now, isn't it?
Yes.
promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
I won't. You know I won't.
Harry will, won't you? - Yeah. Every week.
I killed Sirius Black!
he's back.
the police are continuing with the investigation...
... into the cause of the Millennium Bridge disaster.
traffic has been halted as police search for survivors.
the surrounding area remains closed.
the mayor has urged Londoners to remain calm...
Harry Potter.
who's Harry Potter?
Oh, no one.
bit of a tosser, really.
funny, that paper of yours.
couple nights ago, I could've sworn I saw a picture move.
Really? - Thought I was going around the twist.
Hey, I was wondering... - Eleven. That's when I get off.
you can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter.
you've been reckless this summer, Harry.
I like riding around on trains.
takes my mind off things.
rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?
the tale is thrilling, if I say so myself.
but now is not the time to tell it.
take my arm.
do as I say.
I just Apparated, didn't I?
indeed. Quite successfully too, I might add.
most people vomit the first time.
I can't imagine why.
welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're wondering why I brought you here.
am I right?
actually, sir, after all these years, I just sort of go with it.
wands out, Harry.
Horace?
Horace?
Merlin's beard!
no need to disfigure me, Albus.
well, I must say you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.
it's all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?
dragon's blood.
Oh. - Oh, yes, introductions.
Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine...
...Horace Slughorn.
Horace...
...well, you know who this is.
Harry Potter.
what's with all the theatrics, Horace?
you weren't, by any chance, waiting for someone else?
someone else? I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
all right, the Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.
do you know what that's like?
you can only say no so many times, so I never stay anywhere more than a week.
muggles who own this are in the Canary Islands.
well, I think we should put it back in order for them, don't you? Mind.
that was fun.
do you mind if I use the loo? - No, of course.
don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus.
the answer's still no. Absolutely and unequivocally, no.
you're very like your father.
except for the eyes. You have your... - My mother's eyes. Yeah.
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was exceedingly bright, your mother.
even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.
one of my best friends is Muggle-born. Best in our year.
please don't think I'm prejudiced. No, no.
your mother was one of my absolute favorites. Look, there she is.
right at the front.
all mine. Each and every one.
Ex-students, I mean.
you recognize Barnabas Cuffe, editor of The Daily Prophet.
always takes my owl, should I wish to register an opinion...
...on the news of the day.
Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holy head Harpies.
free tickets whenever I want them.
of course, I haven't been to a match in some time.
Ah, yes.
Regulus Black.
you no doubt know of his older brother Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.
I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius.
it's a shame. Talented boy.
I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I'd have liked the set.
Horace?
do you mind if I take this?
I do love knitting patterns. - Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?
I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable.
I would have considered it a personal triumph...
...had you consented to return to Hogwarts. Oh, well.
you're like my friend Mr. Potter here, one of a kind.
well, bye-bye, Horace.
Bye.
all right. I'll do it.
but I want Professor Merry thought's old office, not the water closet I had before.
and I expect a raise. These are mad times we live in. Mad!
they are indeed.
sir, exactly what was all that about?
you are talented, famous and powerful. Everything Horace values.
professor Slug horn is gonna try to collect you, Harry.
you would be his crowning jewel.
that's why he's returning to Hogwarts. And it's crucial he should return.
I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry.
she was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.
it's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse.
Oh, you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.
but, sir, what about Hedwig? And my trunk?
both are waiting for you.
Hedwig.
mum?
Ginny, what is it?
I was only wondering when Harry got here.
what? Harry? Harry who? - Harry Potter, of course.
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I?
his trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl. - No, dear, I seriously doubt that.
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?
me, nosy. Is he up there with you?
of course not. I'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't I?
is that an owl? - You haven't seen him, have you?
he's wandering about the house.
Really? - Really.
Harry!
Harry!
what a lovely surprise.
why didn't you let us know you were coming?
I didn't know. Dumbledore. - Oh, that man.
but then, what would we do without him?
got a bit of toothpaste.
so when did you get here?
a few days ago.
though for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming.
mum sort of lost it last week.
said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.
that it's too dangerous.
Oh, come on. - She's not alone.
even my parents, and they're Muggles, know something bad's happening.
anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy...
...and it took a few days, but she came around.
but this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?
there's been a lot of talk recently that...
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.
rubbish! Well, he's only...
what is he?
hundred and fifty? Give or take a few years.
Cissy! You can't do this! He can't be trusted!
the Dark Lord trusts him.
the Dark Lord's mistaken. - Pfft.
run along, Worm tail.
I know I ought not to be here.
the Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this.
if the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.
put it down, Bella. We mustn't touch what isn't ours.
as it so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.
you?
the Dark Lord told you?
your sister doubts me.
understandable. Over the years I've played my part well.
so well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.
I don't doubt you, Severus.
you should be honored, Cissy. As should Draco.
he's just a boy.
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.
but it might be possible for me to help Draco.
Severus. - Swear to it.
make the Unbreakable Vow.
it's just empty words.
he'll give it his best effort.
but when it matters most...
...he'll just slither back into his hole.
coward.
take out your wand.
will you...
...Severus Snape...
...watch over Draco Malfoy...
...as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?
I will.
and will you, to the best of your ability...
...protect him from harm?
I will.
and if Draco should fail...
...will you yourself carry out the deed...
...the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?
I will.
step up! Step up! We've got Fainting Fancies!
nosebleed Nougats!
and just in time for school... - Puking Pastilles!
into the cauldron, handsome. - Into the cauldron, handsome.
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. - A real money spinner, that.
handy if you need to make a quick getaway.
Hello, ladies. - Hello, ladies.
love potions, eh? - Yeah, they really do work.
then again, the way we hear it, sis, you're doing just fine on your own.
Meaning?
are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
it's none of your business.
how much for this?
five Galleons. - Five Galleons.
how much for me? - Five Galleons.
I'm your brother.
ten Galleons. - Ten Galleons.
come on, let's go.
Hi, Ron.
how are Fred and George doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.
Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.
I reckon he's right.
Oh, no.
everyone got their wands from Ollivander's.
Harry?
is it me, or do Draco and Mummy look like two people...
...who don't want to be followed?
quibbler.
quibbler.
he's lovely. They've been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know.
Quibbler? - Oh, please.
what's a Wrack spurt? - They're invisible creatures.
they float in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy.
quibbler.
so, what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet?
and who were all those people?
don't you see? It was a ceremony, an initiation.
stop it, Harry. I know where you're going.
it's happened. He's one of them.
one of what?
Harry is under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
you're barking.
what would You-Know-Who want with Malfoy?
well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?
it's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.
look, his father is a Death Eater. It only makes sense.
hermione saw it with her own eyes.
I told you, I don't know what I saw.
I need some air.
don't worry. When we get to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.
what was that? Blaise? - Don't know.
relax, boys. It's probably just a first-year messing around.
come on, Draco. Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon.
Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school.
I'd pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower...
...if I had to continue for another two years.
what's that supposed to mean?
let's just say you won't see me wasting my time in Charms class next year.
amused, Blaise?
we'll see just who's laughing in the end.
you two go on. I wanna check something.
Where's Harry?
he's probably already on the platform. Come on.
didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?
Petrificus Totalus.
...she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.
that's for my father. Enjoy your ride back to London.
finite.
Hello, Harry. - Luna!
how'd you know where I was? - Wrack spurts. Your head's full of them.
sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna.
that's all right. It was like being with a friend.
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.
that's nice.
about time. I've been looking all over for you two.
right. Names?
professor Flitwick, you've known me for five years.
no exceptions, Potter.
who are those people?
Aurors. For security.
what's this cane here, then?
it's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick.
and what exactly would you be wanting with a...?
could be construed as an offensive weapon.
it's all right, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
nice face, Potter.
would you like me to fix it for you?
personally, I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way...
...but it's up to you.
well, have you ever fixed a nose before?
no, but I've done several toes, and how different are they, really?
um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.
Episkey. - Ah!
how do I look? - Exceptionally ordinary.
brilliant.
don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.
will you stop eating?
your best friend is missing!
oi. Turn around, you lunatic.
he's covered in blood again.
why is it he's always covered in blood? - Looks like it's his own this time.
where have you been?
what happened to your face? - Later.
what've I missed?
sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times.
easy for it to say, huh? It's a hat, isn't it?
very best of evenings to you all.
Thanks.
first off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff...
...Horace Slug horn.
professor Slug horn, I'm happy to say...
...has agreed to resume his old post as Potions Master.
meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts...
...will be taken by Professor Snape.
Snape?
now, as you know...
...each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival here tonight.
and you have the right to know why.
once there was a young man, who, like you...
...sat in this very hall...
...walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roof.
he seemed to all the world a student like any other.
his name?
Tom Riddle.
today, of course...
...he's known all over the world by another name.
which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight...
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.
every day, every hour...
...this very minute, perhaps...
...dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls.
but in the end, their greatest weapon is you.
just something to think about.
now, off to bed. Pip-pip.
that was cheerful.
history of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down.
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies! That is the girls' lavatory.
Potter.
Oh, this can't be good.
enjoying ourselves, are we?
I had a free period this morning. - So I noticed.
I would think you would want to fill it with Potions.
or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?
it was, but I was told I had to get an "Outstanding" in my O. W.L.
so you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions.
however, Professor Slug horn is perfectly happy to accept N. E.W. T. s students...
...with "Exceeds Expectations.
brilliant. Um...
well, I'll head there straightaway. - Oh, good, good.
Potter, take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.
I don't wanna take Potions.
this is Quid ditch trials coming up. I need to practice.
attention to detail in the preparation...
...is the prerequisite of all planning.
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry. We've brought someone with us, I see.
Ron Weasley, sir.
but I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace, actually.
I'm gonna... - Nonsense, we'll sort you out.
any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. Get your books out.
I haven't actually got my book yet, and nor has Ron.
get what you want from the cupboard.
now, as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning.
any ideas what these might be?
Yes, Miss...? - Granger, sir.
that one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth-telling serum.
and that would be Polyjuice Potion.
it's terribly tricky to make.
and this is Amortentia...
...the most powerful love potion in the world.
it's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them.
for example, I smell...
...freshly mown grass, and new parchment, and...
...spearmint toothpaste.
Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible.
but it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession.
and for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.
sir? You haven't told us what's in that one.
Oh, yes.
what you see before you, ladies and gentlemen...
...is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis.
but it is more commonly referred to as...
liquid luck. - Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.
desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong.
one sip and you will find that all of your endeavors succeed.
at least until the effects wear off.
so this is what I offer each of you today.
one tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour that remains...
...manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death...
...the recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books.
I should point out, however, only once did a student manage to brew a potion...
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.
nevertheless, good luck to you all.
let the brewing commence.
this book is the property of the half blood prince， cut the sopophorus bean
how did you do that?
you crush it. Don't cut it.
no. The instructions specifically say to cut.
no, really.
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.
so perfect I daresay one drop would kill us all.
so here we are, then, as promised.
one vial of Felix Felicis.
Congratulations.
use it well.
Harry, you got my message. Come in.
how are you?
I'm fine, sir.
enjoying your classes?
I know Professor Slug horn is most impressed with you.
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.
do you?
definitely.
what about your activities outside the classroom?
sir? - Well, I notice you spend...
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.
I can't help wondering...
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant, and we're friends, but, no.
forgive me. I was merely being curious.
but enough chitchat.
you must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight.
the answer lies here.
what you are looking at are memories.
in this case, pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.
this vial contains the most particular memory...
...of the day I first met him.
I'd like you to see it, if you would.
I admit some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.
wool's orphan
in all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor.
there have been incidents with the other children. Nasty things.
Tom, you have a visitor.
how do you do, Tom?
don't.
you're the doctor, aren't you? - No.
I am a professor.
I don't believe you.
she wants me looked at.
they think I'm different.
well, perhaps they're right.
I'm not mad.
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
Hogwarts is a school.
a school of magic.
you can do things, can't you, Tom?
things other children can't.
I can make things move without touching them.
I can make animals do what I want without training them.
I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.
I can make them hurt...
...if I want.
who are you?
well, I'm like you, Tom.
I'm different.
prove it.
I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom.
thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom.
at Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it.
you understand me?
I can speak to snakes too.
they find me.
whisper things.
is that normal for someone like me?
did you know, sir? Then?
did I know I'd just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.
if I had, I...
over time, while here at Hogwarts...
...Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.
can you guess who that teacher might be?
you didn't bring Professor Slug horn back simply to teach Potions, did you?
no, I did not.
you see, Professor Slug horn possesses something I desire very dearly.
and he will not give it up easily.
you said Professor Slug horn would try to collect me.
I did.
do you want me to let him?
Yes.
all right. Um...
this morning, I'm gonna be putting you all through a few drills...
...just to assess your strengths.
quiet! Please!
shut it!
Thanks. All right. Um...
just because you made the team last year...
...does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear?
good.
no hard feelings, Weasley, all right?
hard feelings?
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well. It's nothing personal.
Really? Strapping guy like you?
you've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think?
keepers need to be quick, agile.
Oh, I like my chances.
say, think you could introduce me to your friend Granger?
wouldn't mind getting on a first-name basis, know what I mean?
come on, Weasley!
come on, Ron! - Go on, Weasley!
go on, Weasley! - Yeah, Ron!
go on, Cormac!
come on, Ron!
come on, Ron.
Confundus.
isn't he brilliant?
I have to admit, I thought I was gonna miss that last one.
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.
he's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.
he's vile.
have you ever heard of this spell? Sectumsempra?
no, I haven't.
and if you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in.
not bloody likely. He's top of the class.
he's even better than you, Hermione. Slug horn thinks he's a genius.
what?
I'd like to know whose that book was. Let's have a look.
no.
why not?
the binding is fragile.
the binding is fragile? - Yeah.
who's the Half-Blood Prince? - Who?
that's what it says right here: "This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince.
for weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it...
... yet you have no desire to find out who he is?
I didn't say I wasn't curious, and I don't sleep with it.
well, it's true.
I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now all you do is read that bloody book.
it's just like being with Hermione.
well, I was curious, so I went to...
the library. - The library. And?
and nothing.
I couldn't find a reference anywhere to a Half-Blood Prince.
there we go. That settles it, then. - Filius!
I was hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks!
no, emergency choir practice, I'm afraid, Horace.
does anyone fancy a Butter beer?
a chum of mine was sledging down Claxby Hill.
we had a very long, homemade, Norwegian-style sledge...
no, not there. Over here.
no, sit beside me.
okay.
something to drink?
three Butter beers, and some ginger in mine, please.
Oh, bloody hell.
slick git.
honestly, Ronald, they're only holding hands.
and snogging.
I'd like to leave. - What?
you can't be serious.
that happens to be my sister. - So?
what if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? You expect her to leave?
Hey, my boy! - Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.
and you, and you.
so, what brings you here?
the Three Broomsticks and I go way back, further than I care to admit.
I can remember when it was One Broomstick.
all hands on deck, Granger. Listen, my boy, in the old days...
...I used to throw together the occasional supper party...
...for the select student or two.
would you be game? - I'd consider it an honor, sir.
you would be welcome too, Granger.
I'd be delighted, sir. - Splendid. Look for my owl.
good to see you, Wallenby.
what are you playing at?
Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him.
get to know him? - I don't know.
it must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.
got a little bit...
Katie, you don't know what it could be.
Harry. - What?
did you hear what she said back at the pub about me and her snogging?
as if.
I warned her. I warned her not to touch it.
don't get any closer. Get back, all of you.
do not touch that, except by the wrappings. Do you understand?
you're sure Katie did not have this in her possession...
...when she entered the Three Broomsticks?
it's like I said.
she left to go to the loo, and when she came back she had the package.
she said it was important that she deliver it.
did she say to whom? - To Professor Dumbledore.
very well. Thank you, Leanne. You may go.
why is it when something happens it is always you three?
believe me, professor, I've been asking myself the same question for six years.
mcgonagall: Oh, Severus.
what do you think?
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.
she was cursed, wasn't she?
I know Katie. Off the pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly.
if she was delivering that to Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly.
Yes, she was cursed.
it was Malfoy.
that is a very serious accusation, Potter.
indeed.
your evidence? - I just know.
you just...
...know.
you astonish with your gifts, Potter.
gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing.
how grand it must be to be the Chosen One.
I suggest you go back to your dormitories. All of you.
what do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny?
well, what does she see in him?
Dean? He's brilliant.
you called him a slick git not five hours ago.
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?
something snaps, and you've gotta hate him, you know? On principle.
I suppose.
so, what is it he sees in her? - I don't know.
she's smart, funny.
attractive. - Attractive?
you know, she's got nice skin. - Skin?
Dean dates my sister because of her skin?
well, no, I mean, I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.
hermione's got nice skin.
wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.
I've never really thought about it.
but, I suppose, yeah.
very nice.
I think I'll be going to sleep now. - Right. Yeah.
so tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your Uncle Tiberius these days?
Yes, sir. In fact, I'm meant to go hunting with him...
...and the Minister for Magic over the holidays.
well, be sure to give them both my best.
what about your uncle, Belby?
for those who don't know, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfs bane Potion.
is he working on anything new? - Don't know.
him and Dad don't get on. Probably because me dad says potions are rubbish.
says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day.
what about you, Miss Granger? What does your family do in the Muggle world?
my parents are dentists.
they tend to people's teeth.
fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession?
no.
although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did bite my father once.
he needed 10 stitches.
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.
look at her eyes. They've been fighting again, her and Dean.
sorry. I'm not usually late.
no matter. You're just in time for dessert, that is, if Belby's left you any.
what?
nothing.
goodbye. Bye-bye.
Potter. - I'm sorry, sir.
I was just admiring your hourglass.
Oh, yes.
a most intriguing object.
the sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation.
if it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.
if it is not... - I think I'll be going.
nonsense. You have nothing to fear, dear boy.
as to some of your classmates...
...well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.
the shelf, sir?
anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.
but then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry?
did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?
you knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers whilst here at Hogwarts.
what was he like?
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.
he killed my parents.
of course.
it's only natural you should want to know more.
but I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.
when I first met Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet...
...albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.
not unlike others I've known.
not unlike yourself, in fact.
if the monster existed...
...it was buried deep within.
good luck, eh, Ron.
nice hat! - Ron, you're a loser.
I'm counting on you, Ron. I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?
looking good, Ron. - Loser!
what's he wearing?
so how was it, then?
how was what? - Your dinner party?
pretty boring, actually.
though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
slug horn's having a Christmas do, you know.
and we're meant to bring someone.
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?
actually, I was going to ask you. - Really?
good luck today, Ron.
I know you'll be brilliant.
I'm resigning. After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot.
have it your way.
juice? - Sure.
Hello, everyone.
you look dreadful, Ron.
is that why you put something in his cup?
is it a tonic?
liquid luck.
don't drink it, Ron.
you could be expelled for that. - I don't know what you're talking about.
come on, Harry. We've got a game to win.
go on, Ron! Do it!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
you really shouldn't have done it.
I know. I suppose I could've just used a Confundus Charm.
that was different. That was tryouts. This was an actual game.
you didn't put it in.
Ron only thought you did.
charms spell. I'm just practicing.
well, they're really good.
how does it feel, Harry?
when you see Dean with Ginny?
I know.
I see the way you look at her.
you're my best friend.
Oops.
I think this room's taken.
what's with the birds?
Oppugno.
it feels like this.
look, I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.
what Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it.
it's chemical.
will it last? Who knows? Point is, I'm a free agent.
he's at perfect liberty to kiss whoever he likes.
I really couldn't care less.
was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slug horn's Christmas party?
Yes.
now, given the circumstances, I've had to make other arrangements.
have you?
Yes. Why?
I just thought, seeing as neither of us can go with who we'd really like to...
...we should go together, as friends.
why didn't I think of that?
who are you going with?
um, it's a surprise.
anyway, it's you we've got to worry about. You can't just take anyone.
see that girl over there?
that's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's trying to smuggle you a love potion.
Really?
Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One.
but I am the Chosen One.
okay, sorry. Um, kidding.
I'll ask someone I like.
someone cool.
I've never been to this part of the castle.
at least not while awake. I sleepwalk, you see.
that's why I wear shoes to bed.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
Harmonia Nectere Passus.
drink?
Neville.
I didn't get into the Slug Club.
it's okay, though. He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.
Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks. - Okay.
Hermione. What are you doing? And what happened to you?
I've just escaped. I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.
Cormac? That's who you invited?
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.
thank you. I'll catch up with you later.
he's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
dragon tartare? - No, I'm fine. Thank you.
just as well. They give one horribly bad breath.
on second thoughts...
might keep Cormac at bay.
Oh, God, here he comes.
I think she just went to powder her nose.
slippery little minx, your friend.
likes to work her mouth too, doesn't she?
what is this I'm eating, by the way?
dragon balls.
you've just bought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen.
not so quick, Potter.
sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. My date...
can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
besides, I only wish to convey a message.
a message? - From Professor Dumbledore.
he asked me to give you his best, and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.
you see...
...he's traveling, and he won't return until term resumes.
traveling where?
take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!
professor Slug horn, sir.
I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.
he claims to have been invited to your party.
okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?
I'll escort him out.
certainly, professor.
all right, everyone, carry on, carry on.
maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?
I swore to protect you.
I made the Unbreakable Vow.
I don't need protection.
I was chosen for this. Out of all others. Me.
and I won't fail him. - You're afraid, Draco.
you attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. Let me assist you.
No!
I was chosen. This is my moment.
unbreakable Vow.
you're sure that's what Snape said?
positive. Why?
well, it's just you can't break an Unbreakable Vow.
I'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.
you don't understand.
Oh, bloody hell.
I miss you.
lovely.
all she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
I'll take your word for it.
so, what happens to you? What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow?
you die.
wait, the pudding's still here.
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission?
I know it sounds mad.
has it occurred to you Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help...
...so he could find out what he was up to?
that's not what it sounded like. - Perhaps Harry's right.
to make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...
it comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgment.
Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do. - Dumbledore can make mistakes.
you're blinded by hatred.
I'm not. - Yes, you are.
people are disappearing, Harry, daily.
we place our trust in a handful of people.
if we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed.
open up, you.
don't you trust me?
it's good.
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.
pie? - Not for me, no.
you'll have to forgive Remus.
it takes its toll, his condition.
are you all right, Mr. Weasley?
we're being followed, all of us.
most days, Molly doesn't leave the house.
it's not been easy.
did you get my owl?
Yes, I did.
if Dumbledore's traveling, then that's news to the Ministry...
...but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it.
as for Draco Malfoy...
...I know a bit more.
go on. - I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.
I think, from what you described...
...what you and Ron saw in summer...
...the object that Draco is so interested in...
...is a vanishing cabinet.
a vanishing cabinet?
they were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power.
you can see the appeal. Should Death Eaters come knocking...
...one simply had to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.
they can transport you anywhere.
tricky contraptions though, very temperamental.
what happened to it? The one at Borgin and Burkes?
nothing.
it's still there.
it was delicious, Molly, really.
are you sure you won't stay?
no, we should go. The first night of the cycle's always the worst.
Remus?
sweetheart.
has Ron gone to bed?
um... Not yet. No.
shoelace.
merry Christmas, Harry.
merry Christmas.
Harry, no! - Remus!
Ginny!
I killed Sirius Black! I killed Sirius Black!
you coming to get me?
Harry, can you get me? You coming to get me?
Harry?
Stupefy!
Harry!
Ginny!
Molly.
it's easy for them to get to you.
you're bloody lucky you weren't killed. You have to realize who you are, Harry.
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?
sorry.
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.
that's my Won-Won.
excuse me, I have to go and vomit.
I'd like to know where you get your information.
more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.
sir...
...is it true that Professor Merry thought is retiring?
now, Tom. I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?
by the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right, it is my favorite.
but how did you know?
intuition.
gracious. Is it that time already?
off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet will have us all in detention.
look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught out of bed after hours.
is something on your mind, Tom? - Yes, sir.
you see, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.
the other professors, well, they're not like you.
they might misunderstand.
go on.
I was in the library the other night...
...in the Restricted Section...
...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.
and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.
it's called, as I understand it...
I beg your pardon?
I don't know anything about such things, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!
now, get out of here at once, and don't let me ever catch you mentioning it again!
confused?
I'd be surprised if you weren't.
well, I don't understand. What happened?
this is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.
it is also a lie.
this memory has been tampered with...
...By the same person whose memory it is, our old friend, Professor Slughorn.
but why would he tamper with his own memory?
I suspect he's ashamed of it. - Why?
why, indeed?
I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.
now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory...
...any way you can.
I don't know him that well, sir.
this memory is everything.
without it, we are blind.
without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.
you have no choice.
you must not fail.
so I'd highly recommend you reacquaint yourself...
...with the chapter on antidotes.
I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. Right, off you go.
alys, don't forget your rat tail.
Aha. If it isn't the Prince of Potions himself.
to what do I owe this pleasure?
sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.
ask away, dear boy, ask away.
the other day I was in the library, in the Restricted Section...
...and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic.
Yes. And what was this rare piece of magic?
well, I don't know. I can't remember the name exactly.
it got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us?
I'm Potions Master, Harry.
I think your question'd better be posed to Professor Snape.
Yes. Um...
he and I don't exactly see eye to eye, sir.
what I mean to say is...
...well, he's not like you.
he might misunderstand.
Yes. There can be no light without the dark.
and so it is with magic. Myself, I always strive to live within the light.
I suggest you do the same.
is that what you told Tom Riddle, when he came asking questions?
Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he?
didn't he?
yes?
Oh, it's you, Potter.
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.
it's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.
divine.
had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?
it was on your bed, the box. I just thought I'd try one.
or 20. - I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.
honestly, I reckoned she was annoying you.
she could never annoy me.
I think I love her.
well, brilliant.
do you think she knows I exist?
I hope so. She's been snogging you for three months.
snogging? Who are you talking about?
who are you talking about?
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.
okay, very funny.
what was that for? - It's no joke! I'm in love with her!
fine, you're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her?
no. Can you introduce me?
come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you to Romilda Vane.
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential.
Where's Romilda?
what's the matter with Wenby?
very powerful love potion.
very well. Better bring him in.
I'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry.
well, I thought this called for a more practiced hand, sir.
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?
perhaps you're right.
I'm sorry, by the way, professor, about earlier today, our misunderstanding.
Oh, not at all. All water under the bridge, you know? Correct?
I expect you're tired of it after all these years.
all the questions about Voldemort.
don't use that name.
there you are, old boy. Bottoms up.
what's this? - Tonic for the nerves.
what happened to me? - Love potion.
a bloody strong one at that.
I feel really bad. - You need a pick-me-up.
got Butter beer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.
I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances...
here we are, Potter.
to life!
Ron.
Ron. Professor, do something.
I don't understand.
come on, Ron, breathe.
these girls, they're gonna kill me.
quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar.
you must be very proud of your student, Horace.
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.
I think we agree, Potter's actions were heroic.
the question is, why were they necessary?
why, indeed?
this appears to be a gift, Horace.
you don't remember who gave you this bottle?
which, by the way, possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry...
......when not polluted with poison.
actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.
to whom, I might ask?
to you, Headmaster.
where is he?
Where's my Won-Won? Has he been asking for me?
what's she doing here?
I might ask you the same question.
I happen to be his girlfriend.
I happen to be his friend.
don't make me laugh. You haven't spoken in weeks.
I suppose you want to make up now that he's all interesting.
he's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!
and for the record, I've always found him interesting.
Ah. See? He senses my presence.
don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.
I'm here.
uh... Hermione...
Hermione.
Hermione.
Oh, to be young, and to feel love's keen sting.
well, come away, everybody.
Mr. Weasley is well tended.
about time, don't you think?
thank you.
Oh, shut up.
stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.
tell me how I broke up with Lavender again.
um, well...
...she came to visit you in the hospital.
and you talked.
I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation.
don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.
it's just she seems a bit put out.
Yes, she does, doesn't she?
you say you don't remember anything from that night?
anything at all?
there is something.
but it can't be. I was completely boggled, wasn't I?
right. Boggled.
Harry.
that's Katie.
Katie Bell.
Katie. How are you?
I know you're going to ask, Harry, but I don't know who cursed me.
I've been trying to remember, honestly.
but I just can't.
Katie?
I know what you did, Malfoy. You hexed her, didn't you?
Sectumsempra!
Vulnera Sanentur.
Vulnera Sanentur.
Vulnera Sanentur.
you have to get rid of it. Today.
take my hand.
the Room of Requirement.
we need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book...
...where no one will ever find it, including you.
what was that? - What was that?
see?
you never know what you'll find up here.
all right, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted.
close your eyes.
that can stay hidden up here too, if you like.
so did you and Ginny do it, then?
what?
you know, hide the book?
Oh, yeah.
Ah. Dear, yes.
still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it?
luck.
that's it. All I need's a bit of luck.
well, how do you feel?
excellent.
really excellent.
remember...
...Slug horn usually eats early...
...takes a walk, and then returns to his office.
right.
I'm going down to Hagrid's. - What?
no, Harry, you've got to go and speak to Slug horn.
we have a plan. - I know...
...but I've got a good feeling about Hagrid's.
I feel it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean?
no. - Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.
or Felix does.
Merlin's beard, Harry!
sorry, sir. I should've announced myself. Cleared my throat, coughed.
you probably feared I was Professor Sprout.
Yes, I did, actually. What makes you think that?
well, just the general behavior, sir.
the sneaking around, the jumping when you saw me.
are those Tentacula leaves, sir? They're very valuable, aren't they?
ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.
not that I'm familiar with any such transactions, but one does hear rumors.
my own interests are purely academic, of course.
personally, these plants always kind of freaked me out.
how did you get out of the castle, Harry?
through the front door, sir.
I'm off to Hagrid's. He's a very dear friend...
...and I fancied paying him a visit.
so if you don't mind, I will be going now.
Harry!
sir? - It's nearly nightfall.
surely you realize I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself.
well, then, by all means, come along, sir.
Harry, I must insist you accompany me...
...back to the castle immediately!
that would be counterproductive, sir.
and what makes you say that?
no idea.
Horace.
Merlin's beard. Is that an actual Acromantula?
a dead one, I think, sir.
good God.
dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it?
kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.
I'm so sorry, I didn't... - Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.
seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are.
it's the eyes, I reckon. They unnerve some folk.
not to mention the pincers.
Yeah, I reckon that too.
Hagrid, the last thing I wish to be is indelicate...
...but Acromantular venom is uncommonly rare.
would you allow me to extract a vial or two?
purely for academic purposes, you understand.
well, I don't suppose it's going to do him much good now, is it?
my thoughts exactly.
always have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occasions as this.
old Potions Master's habit, you know.
I wish you could've seen him in his prime.
magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.
Oh, dear.
would you like me to say a few words? - Yes.
he had a family, I trust?
Oh, yeah.
farewell...
Aragog.
farewell, Aragog...
...King of the arachnids.
your body will decay...
...but your spirit lingers on.
and your human friends find solace in the loss they have sustained.
I had him from an egg, you know. Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.
no bigger than a Pekinese. A Pekinese, mind you.
how sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. He was very dear to me.
one afternoon I came downstairs, and he'd vanished.
poof.
that's very odd, isn't it? - It is, isn't it?
but that's life, I suppose.
you go along and then suddenly, poof!
poof. - Poof.
it was a student who gave me Francis.
one spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk...
...with just a few inches of clear water in it.
and floating on the surface was a flower petal.
as I watched, it sank.
just before it reached the bottom...
...it transformed...
...into a wee fish.
it was beautiful magic.
wondrous to behold.
the flower petal had come from a lily.
your mother.
the day I came downstairs...
...the day the bowl was empty...
...was the day your mother...
I know why you're here.
but I can't help you.
it would ruin me.
do you know why I survived, professor?
the night I got this?
because of her.
because she sacrificed herself.
because she refused to step aside.
because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
don't say his name. - I'm not afraid of the name, professor.
I'm going to tell you something.
something others have only guessed at.
it's true.
I am the Chosen One.
only I can destroy him, but in order to do so...
...I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you years ago in your office...
...and I need to know what you told him.
be brave, professor.
be brave like my mother.
otherwise, you disgrace her.
otherwise, she died for nothing.
otherwise, the bowl will remain empty forever.
please, don't think badly of me when you see it.
you've no idea what he was like, even then.
I was in the library the other night...
...in the Restricted Section...
...and I read something rather odd about a bit of rare magic.
it's called, as I understand it...
...a Horcrux.
I beg your pardon? - Horcrux.
I came across the term while reading...
...and I didn't fully understand it.
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom...
...but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.
which is...
...why I came to you.
a Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.
but I don't understand how that works, sir.
one splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.
by doing so, you're protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed.
protected?
that part of your soul that is hidden lives on.
in other words, you cannot die.
and how does one split his soul, sir?
I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.
murder.
Yes.
killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature.
can you only split the soul once? For instance, isn't seven...?
seven?
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person?
to rip the soul into seven pieces...
this is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? All academic?
of course, sir.
it'll be our little secret.
sir.
this is beyond anything I imagined.
you mean to say he succeeded, sir, in making a Horcrux?
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right. And not just once.
what are they exactly?
could be anything. Most commonplace of objects.
a ring, for example.
or a book.
Tom Riddle's diary. - It's a Horcrux, yes.
four years ago, when you saved Ginny's life...
...in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this.
I knew this was a different kind of magic.
very dark, very powerful. But until tonight I had no idea just how powerful.
the ring? - Belonged to Voldemort's mother.
difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy.
but if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux...
one destroys Voldemort.
but how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere.
true. But magic, especially dark magic...
...leaves traces.
it's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?
when you leave the school? - Yes.
and I think perhaps I may have found another.
but this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone.
once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry.
have you ever considered that you ask too much...
...that you take too much for granted?
has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore?
whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.
I will not negotiate with you, Severus. You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.
Oh, Harry.
you need a shave, my friend.
you know, at times, I forget how much you've grown.
at times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard.
forgive my mawkishness, Harry.
I'm an old man.
you still look the same to me, sir.
just like your mother, you're unfailingly kind.
a trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid.
the place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous.
I promised you could accompany me, and I stand by that promise.
but there is one condition:
you must obey every command I give you, without question.
Yes, sir.
you do understand what I'm saying?
should I tell you to hide, you hide.
should I tell you to run, you run.
should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so.
your word, Harry.
my word.
take my arm.
sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts.
well, being me has its privileges.
this is the place.
Oh, yes.
this place has known magic.
sir! - In order to gain passage...
...payment must be made.
payment intended to weaken any intruder.
you should've let me, sir. - No, Harry.
your blood's much more precious than mine.
Voldemort will not have made it easy to discover his hiding place.
he will have put certain defenses in position.
careful.
there it is.
the only question is, how do we get there?
if you would, Harry.
do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
Oh, yes.
it has to be drunk.
all of it has to be drunk.
you remember the conditions on which I brought you with me?
this potion might paralyze me.
might make me forget why I'm here.
might cause me so much pain that I beg for relief.
you are not to indulge these requests.
it's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion.
even if you have to force it down my throat.
understood? - Why can't I drink it, sir?
because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less valuable.
your good health, Harry.
professor.
professor!
Harry.
professor, can you hear me?
professor.
no. Don't.
you have to keep drinking, like you said. Remember?
stop. - It will stop. It will stop...
...but only if you keep drinking. - Please, don't make me.
I'm sorry, sir. - Please.
kill me. Kill me! - No!
it's my fault.
it's all my fault.
it's my fault.
just one more, sir. One more, and then I promise...
...I promise I'll do what you say.
I promise. - No.
please.
Harry.
water.
water.
water.
you did it, sir.
look.
Harry.
water.
Aguamenti.
water.
Lumos.
Lumos Maxima!
Harry.
Sectumsempra!
Harry.
Stupefy! - Harry.
Harry.
partis Temporus!
go to your houses. No dawdling.
we need to get you to the hospital wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.
no.
Severus. Severus is who I need.
wake him. Tell him what happened.
speak to no one else.
Severus, Harry.
hide yourself below, Harry.
don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission.
whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below.
Harry, do as I say.
trust me.
trust me.
good evening, Draco.
what brings you here on this fine spring evening?
who else is here? I heard you talking.
I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.
have you been whispering to yourself, Draco?
Draco...
...you are no assassin. - How do you know what I am?
I've done things that would shock you.
like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?
replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison?
forgive me, Draco.
I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak...
...your heart can't really have been in them.
he trusts me. I was chosen.
then I shall make it easy for you.
Expelliarmus!
very good. Very good.
you're not alone.
there are others.
how?
the vanishing cabinet in the Room of Requirement.
I've been mending it. - Let me guess.
it has a sister. A twin.
in Borgin and Burkes. They form a passage.
ingenious.
Draco...
...years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices.
please let me help you. - I don't want your help!
don't you understand? I have to do this.
I have to kill you.
or he's gonna kill me.
well, look what we have here.
well done, Draco.
good evening, Bellatrix.
I think introductions are in order, don't you?
love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.
do it.
he doesn't have the stomach, just like his father.
let me finish him in my own way.
No! The Dark Lord was clear, the boy is to do it.
this is your moment. Do it.
go on, Draco.
now!
no.
Severus.
please.
Avada Kedavra.
Hagrid! Hello?
Snape! He trusted you!
go on.
Incarcerous.
fight back! You coward, fight back!
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.
Sectumsempra!
you dare use my own spells against me, Potter?
Yes.
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.
mcgonagall: Potter...
...in light of what has happened...
...if you should have the need to talk to someone...
you should know, Professor Dumbledore...
...you meant a great deal to him.
do you think he would've done it?
Draco?
no.
no, he was lowering his wand.
in the end, it was Snape.
it was always Snape.
and I did nothing.
it's fake.
open it.
to the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this...
...but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match...
...you will be mortal once more.
don't know.
but whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.
which means it was all a waste.
all of it.
Ron's okay with it, you know.
you and Ginny.
but if I were you, when he's around, I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.
I'm not coming back, Hermione.
I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started.
and I don't know where that'll lead me...
...but I'll let you and Ron know where I am when I can.
I've always admired your courage, Harry.
but sometimes, you can be really thick.
you don't really think you're going to be able...
...to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you?
you need us, Harry.
I never realized how beautiful this place was.
they say the moral of the story comes at the end.
but ask me, sometimes it comes at the top, in the middle, and you just don't get it till the end.
your aim was to try to tame me!
sir, um, no, wait.
a lot of times, I don't get it at all.
in less than a month, you have gone from being one of the best patent lawyers in the country, much less Cincinnati, and now... what the hell has happened?
well, what's happened is after 32 years of rather dedicated practice,
I've come to the unfortunate, if not altogether surprising, conclusion that patent law is as boring as a big bowl of steaming dog... Shut the door, Jenna.
it's dull, Robert.
I lead a dull life with dull partners.
I'd sooner look into a mirror and watch my teeth rot than do one more case involving patent law.
as always, I value your feedback.
I'm afraid this is the end, Harry.
the end of what?
you're fired.
somebody obnoxious once said,"Every knock is a boost."
maybe not. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
somebody call an ambulance! Somebody call 911!
help!
please don't die.
please don't die.
please don't die.
come on... please...
you sure you're really okay?
doctor says I am.
nothing broken, no concussion.
I'm missing a sock.
you weren't wearing socks.
you don't feel lightheaded, even, or... maybe delusional?
I'm telling you, one second I'm walking down the street, and the next... I'm so sorry.
where, exactly, did you come from?
I jumped off a building.
it's, uh, you leap onto awnings and you roll off.
it's kind of an urban sport thing.
I never saw you.
what's your name, son?
you're not being truthful with me, Malcolm.
that building is six stories high.
the sport you were playing is called "extreme suicide.
you were trying to kill yourself, weren't you, Malcolm?
Why?
maybe the question is Why not?
maybe there's a better world somewhere, one without people.
or maybe it's just across the street.
all of a sudden, it was the first day of the rest of my...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Is she dead?
Oh, my God, is she dead?!
she looks dead.
you! Big guy.
is she dead? Help!
how could you not be dead?
or at least have broken bones?
I told you I landed on a mattress these movers were unloading.
right, but the car struck you.
mostly soft tissue.
she's like a big stuffy.
there you go, a diagnosis big stuffy.
can I go now?
let me first check the X-rays one more time.
are you okay? - Fine.
this is the man who hit me.
man who hit me, meet Jenna.
Where's my other shoe? - Wait a second. I know you.
you're Harriet Korn.
I did a big patent case against you.
I was one of the associates on the Firestone case.
I argued the class consolidation, remember?
you called me an... Arrogant little snot.
I remember.
were you aiming for me with your car? - What?
you hit me on purpose, didn't you? - Of course I didn't. You stepped off the curb, and...
what were you even doing there? - I work in that neighborhood.
excuse me? - Excuse me?
at least I will.
she's not herself.
before you hit her, a black man fell from the sky onto her head.
well, it doesn't make any medical sense to me.
but there's nothing broken.
you can go.
okay. Okay.
we can make it work.
it just needs a little love.
Jenna, I can't afford to pay you. - What's with all the shoes, though?
previous tenant. Got evicted, - left all this stuff behind. - Prada. Jimmy Choo.
what's wrong?
white satin stiletto sandals with horsehair and crystal straps.
is that good? - Is it good? Good? It's a...
gold leather, five-inch woven, wicker wedge heel.
ms. Korn?
I was trying to kill myself.
Why?
I'm facing prison.
I got arrested on a drug charge third offense and,
I got a cocaine problem.
I'm working on it, but...
anyway, I was thinking, everything happens for a reason.
and I figured, I landed splat on you 'cause I wasn't meant to die.
will you represent me?
please?
son... I'm not a criminal lawyer.
I Googled you. You're supposed to be really good. - At patent law.
Harry, you need clients.
it's not as if you have any. And this...
this is a deep blue patent leather with a peep-toe.
ms. Korn, I know it sounds crazy, but I really do think I fell on you for a reason.
I mean... I suddenly don't want to die anymore.
that's because you gained perspective.
near-death experiences can do that.
maybe.
maybe it's something about you.
she was involved in some sort of overhead collision.
she was being released from the hospital.
that's when you subsequently collided with her.
would you like me to do a background check?
I don't need to do a background check on Harry Korn.
my sources at Sterling & Fremont say she was becoming increasingly insubordinate.
God, when I was on that case, I loved watching her work.
I remember even saying to myself,"Please let me run into this lady again."
not with a car.
she's really working in that neighborhood?
still looking to get confirmation on that.
there's always something a lawyer can do.
Malcolm, you were caught buying from an undercover agent.
this is your third offense.
you're gonna have to do some time.
here we go.
I'm a freshman in college.
I'm the first one in my family who ever made it...
you have no idea how many people I'm gonna be letting down.
uh, let me talk to the DA.
see if he's willing to consider a plea.
thank you.
thank you.
okay, okay, okay. How we doing?
I'll take that desk, Jen. Is it Jen?
I would love some coffee.
wait, let me guess It's a bird! It's a plane!
little tip for the future.
you want to jump? Okay.
but not on lawyers. You on drugs?
track my finger left, right, left, right.
coffee?
what are you doing? - I'm temping.
I took a little leave until you land on your feet.
least I could do, - No, no.
you're not working here. - Why not? We can be a team.
me and you, you and me. Happy together.
I'm not getting coffee, am I?
get out. - Harriet. Come on. We clicked.
we did not click. - You think you can do this alone?
maybe you can.
but I'd like to help you, just the same.
I mean, of all the people I could've mowed down with my high-performance vehicle it was you.
Hey, ladies.
how we doin'?
how you doin', Slick?
may I speak to the manager?
who are you?
my name is Damien Winslow, and I'm CEO of Winslow Security, I-N-C.
we provide privatized security to the local merchants in the neighborhood, which is necessary 'cause Cincinnati's finest ain't too quick to respond sometimes.
you know what I'm sayin'?
sup, sweets?
sup, Slick?
anyway, I'm sure you'll find $200 a month to be very reasonable.
are you the manager?
I am. And I pass.
ma'am, I don't think that's a wise decision.
look, Bub Can I call you Bub?
cause I sense a connection.
she passed.
it's just the merchants who choose not to engage the services of Winslow Security, police don't really respond to alarms in this neighborhood, - you know what I'm sayin'? - Yes.
thank you again, but I already have protection.
I won't be needing Winslow Security, I-N-C.
Oh, you got protection, do you?
who that be?
it be this.
are you serious? - Tell you what, Damien.
you can smash my windows, beat me up, God forbid, plagiarize my loved ones.
but I'm a lawyer who's used to working with P. I.'s,
da's and police, some of 'em honest, others not so much.
I have the means to find out all about you, your mother, your sister, and your wife, should you have them.
say hello to my iPhone.
just took yo picture.
you got family, Mr. Winslow?
cause if anything should happen to me, my people will find you and yours.
now, here's a deal I will make.
you protect me and my place.
and as long as I stay safe, if and when you get arrested,
I'm figuring when my law firm will defend you for free.
isn't that funny?
you walked in here offering to save me.
it looks like I could be saving you.
don't you just love how life can take unexpected turns?
what do you mean, let him go?
you kidding me? You kidding me?
I'm not saying let him go without consequences.
Yeah, just without jail.
let me tell you, counsel, jail is the only consequence these people understand.
these people? - please.
you're gonna make it a black thing now?
gonna make it a black thing?
give me a break. Give me a break.
third offense, I'll give you a year.
best I can do, best I can do.
Yeah, the thing is, if he gets any time, he'll get expelled from college.
well, wish I could help you.
it doesn't really sound like you wish you could help me, Mr. Peyton.
in fact, it sounds like you wish I'd bugger off.
is that what you really wish?
what, you want to make sport of me now, that it, that it?
cause I got to tell you, you're a slightly bigger target at the moment.
you think I don't know the book on you?
hotshot corporate lawyer suddenly goes cartoon happy, now you're in here defending drug addicts?
what's that, what's that?
how you doing, Sal? What's that?
Mr. Peyton, this boy needs a break.
Yeah, well, don't we all?
let me tell you, you think you're gonna get no time for a three-time loser?
not gonna happen. Not gonna happen.
and my feeling is they'll take a look at me and they'll look at you, and they'll tumble to something you know all too well.
which is?
you're an asshole.
I love it, I do, but it's a bit pricey.
and this one I also like, and it's half the cost, right?
well, yes, but can I be honest? - Of course.
not Prada.
Prada.
not Prada.
not Prada.
what are you doing?
Harry, hi, um, one sec, I'm with a customer.
never mind "one sec."
get rid of these shoes.
Harry oh, one sec.
Harriet's Law and Fine Shoes.
what did she just say?
what?
Oh, okay, um, hold, hold, please.
it's that Damien person.
he said something about a shooting.
he sounds a little hysterical.
that didn't take long.
he's at the Chinese Laundromat two blocks down, at the corner of Beacon and Middlesex.
okay. Adam, Damien's all yours.
what?
you said you want to work here;you need a case. Go.
Malcolm, sit.
I can ring you up. Yeah?
get rid of these shoes.
I got nowhere with the DA, which means you got two choices take the deal for one year...
or go for jury nullification, which basically is,
we know he did it, but wink, wink we let him go anyway.
does that work?
almost never.
take the deal.
no, I... I want to go for it.
in which case you could get three years.
please, look, I know it's a long shot, but one year is as bad as three years as far as college...
I fell on you for a reason.
you want some advice?
I'm not sure it's technically legal, but things rarely happen for a reason.
most things in life make absolutely no sense, and what makes the least sense of all - is for you to roll the dice with some slam-dunk loser - I'm trying this case.
you bailing, or you still with me?
thank you.
what the...?
I must have hit a vein or something.
get a tourniquet on. Call 911.
he needs a tourniquet.
man, give me your tie.
are you calling?
hurry up, man, give it to me!
all right, all right, stick your finger in there.
what?
do it, man.
Oh, my God!
just press down hard as you can.
I am!
I think I got it. I think I got it.
did you call 911?
okay, okay, okay, it stopped, it stopped, it stopped.
hang on, bro, we cool, we cool. We cool.
you shot this man?
allegedly, okay?
allegedly.
I'm telling you, I was not a witness.
I got here after the fact.
the only thing I saw was the one in handcuffs saving the life of the wounded guy.
what's your relationship to Mr. Winslow?
I'm his lawyer, which means I need to be talking to him, not you.
Hey, man, what's going on?
I asked for the old lady.
well, you didn't get her. Excuse me, I'm his attorney.
give me a second. - Forget it.
self-defense, Columbo. - Damien.
allegedly. - Don't be saying a word.
you hear me, Damien? Not a word.
I will see you at the police station.
in the meantime, shut up.
do you hear me?
shut up.
I asked for the old lady.
isn't it looking great?
no, it looks like a shoe store.
well, there's no reason we can't be both a law firm and a shoe store.
no. - Harriet Korn, listen to me.
I know footwear.
I can make this work.
I will make it work.
okay?
now... are you all set for court?
am I all set?
I'm about to try a case with no defense.
does that sound all set to you?
Adam, what the...?
I'm okay this is somebody else's blood.
do we have running water? - Back room.
what happened? - Damien shot a guy.
he evidently came to the aid of a Laundromat owner he protects.
was anybody killed? - No.
you'd better make sure the victim is tested.
you got blood all over you.
right. - Are you okay?
I'm a little shaky, but... - Where's Damien?
the police took him.
once I get cleaned up, I'll go down there.
you sure you're not hurt? - I'm sure.
I thought you were in trial.
I was working undercover, presenting myself as a drug dealer.
I was approached by the defendant.
he expressed his interest in purchasing cocaine.
a transaction ensued.
we then placed the suspect under arrest.
and Officer, you're certain that the man who purchased the cocaine, the man who gave you money for the cocaine, is the man seated right there that man, this man, that man?
positive.
thank you.
I have nothing further. Nothing further.
good afternoon.
good afternoon, Your Honor.
good afternoon.
excellent, now that we have established that the afternoon is in fact a good one, perhaps we can move on.
first, Officer Tate, speaking as a citizen,
I should start by saying thank you for all the good work you do.
I remember once I got a flat tire in a very bad neighborhood;
I thought I might even get killed.
a policeman came along, probably saved my life.
I apologize, I do realize that this is counsel's first time in a criminal courtroom, but the scope of cross-examination does not include the sharing of personal anecdotes, - however touching. - I was just thanking him.
ms. Korn, maybe you can do that out in the corridor after we're done.
okay.
tell me, Officer, I read a lot in the papers these days how the police budgets have been cut and there have been layoffs and the department is undermanned.
objection assuming facts not in evidence.
I'll remind counsel that her role is to elicit testimony, not provide it.
sustained.
is it true that the department is currently undermanned due to recent budget cuts?
Yes.
well, I'm a little curious with everything on your plate, are you really targeting nonviolent drug users?
I can understand dealers maybe, but...
we actually are targeting the dealers.
I was doing so that night.
we arrest users in the hope they'll flip their suppliers.
so Malcolm he's not really the guy you're after, then?
objection the only question before the court is did the defendant committhe crime with which he is charged?
this is not about departmental policy.
not about that. Not about that.
I'll sustain it.
the boy was in a clinic, trying to get treatment.
it closed. - Objection!
step up, please.
did I do something wrong again?
you're very clever, Ms. Korn.
I'm not sure I know what you're referring to.
I think you do.
the adorable old lady routine bumbling around the courtroom as she accidentally sneaks in inadmissible evidence, back-dooring that this kid wasn't the target, that he was in a clinic.
well, Your Honor, I'm still familiarizing myself with the criminal rules of evidence.
I suspect you know the rules of evidence just fine.
here's the deal, Ms. Korn.
the tricks you pull as a patent lawyer don't be pulling them in my courtroom.
we good with that?
well, I thought you did great.
I don't know.
my only real choice is to put the boy on the stand.
isn't that risky to let the defendant testify?
I mean, they never do that on Law & Order.
Harry, you've taken impossible cases before, and you usually always win them.
well, there's no winning this one, Jenna, and by having him testify, his priors will come in...
so it is true.
you are a shoe store lawyer.
it didn't seem to go that well today.
Mrs. Davies, I'm afraid our case is...
you think maybe I should testify?
well, you could, but the testimony of a loving mother rarely carries the day.
is he going to prison, Ms. Korn?
I don't know.
I'm gonna try my best to prevent that.
but the likelihood... - This is a good boy.
his failings are... This... You need to win this.
no, man.
if I plead, I go to jail.
jail, man.
Damien, you run an illegal enterprise.
you carry concealed weapons and shoot people.
did you really not see jail coming?
you shot a guy. - In self-defense.
Yes. Even if I could sell that, your gun wasn't registered.
what kind of lawyer are you?
you shot a guy!
and if I hadn't, that guy would've robbed that store.
he might've killed innocent people.
are you telling me that don't count for something?
look... - No, you look.
your problem is, you see me as a criminal... and only a criminal.
I do good.
I help people.
I got into this to protect, not to steal.
the people I serve are grateful; ask them.
I help all of them.
and right now... I need you ...help me.
okay, Damien.
I hear you.
and I get it.
I'll fight the fight.
you will? - I will.
thank you. Thank you.
I gotta say, Malcolm, as drug addicts go, you seem like such a swell kid. Swell kid.
and you're the victim.
I mean...
you had no choice but to buy the cocaine.
am I right? Am I right?
I'm not the victim. I know that, sir.
but there are victims here.
aren't there, Malcolm?
see... here's the thing about being a junkie it's expensive.
it costs thousands of dollars a week to get the fix, and the only way most drug addicts can swing that is by stealing, and whose houses do you think they break into, whose cars get hijacked, whose innocent children get killed in the crossfire of their turf wars?
did it ever occur to you, Malcolm, that every time you buy cocaine, you help fund a billion-dollar illegal drug trade that is bringing this country to its knees, a drug trade that is killing innocent people?
it's a billion-dollar trade because it's illegal. - Objection.
maybe we should decriminalize, if your goal...
wait, did you actually just say that?
did you actually just say that?
I believe I did. I believe I did.
what, do you want to just pass drugs out on the street?
is that... That's where they're passed out now, at a thousand times the pharmaceutical cost.
move to strike.
and if we legalize drugs, addicts would need less than two cents on the dollar to support their habits.
they'd hardly have to break into homes or cars or...
we have something called "values" in this country...
and they should coincide with saving the innocent lives you were carrying on about.
you're seriously saying we should legalize drugs is the solution?
everybody commissioned to study the problem has said it.
who? Everybody who?
if we legalize them, we treat the disease instead of punishing it away.
great, then you want to pass out needles, too?
perhaps, if you're against the spread of AIDS. Are you?
if we were to legalize drugs... - We could neutralize the gangs, take the drug business out of the shadows.
and do what? Celebrate it? - How about regulate it? Tax it?
Yes, and then every liberal in America could just light up and say,
hallelujah, legalized drugs!
the idea was first raised by conservative Republicans.
please. When? - When the party had thinkers.
before it was hijacked by the likes of Rush Limbaugh.
here we go. - A drug addict, himself.
ancient history.
who somehow fared much better in our justice system.
I wonder why. - The race card. There it is.
if I wanted to play the race card, I'd talk about the disparity in sentencing.
objection. - But I'm not doing that.
I'm keeping it about one kid only.
he's sitting right there, and he's getting screwed!
Objection!
all right, that's enough.
are we done with this witness?
cause if so, we can proceed to closing arguments, which it seems we've begun anyway.
you can step down, son.
Mr. Peyton, you're up.
I can make this quick.
this isn't about the color of the defendant's skin.
and it isn't about whether drugs should be decriminalized, what laws we should or should not have.
we have to deal with the laws that are on the books today.
it is illegal to buy and use cocaine.
that's the law.
the defendant broke it.
he's admitted doing so. He offered no defense. He did it.
no dispute. Did it.
the only question is, do you abide by your oath to uphold the law, or not?
it's that simple.
it really is.
to be honest, I'm not sure about decriminalizing drugs.
it sounds kind of radical.
but I do know that study after study after study has shown that when you take kids like Malcolm and you stick them in jail, you increase the likelihood that they'll remain addicts, or wind up homeless, or, worst of all, become more hardened and career criminals.
when it comes to drug abuse, treatment is seven times more cost-effective than incarceration seven times.
it's an indisputable fact.
Malcolm broke a law, yes.
he should be held accountable.
but this young man never harmed anybody.
he's in college.
he was in a clinic.
it closed.
somebody said to me the other day...
there's no justice in the law.
well, the dirty little secret is we're not in the justice business, not really.
judges and politicians are mainly in the reelection business.
lawyers, like Mr. Peyton and myself, we're in the "win" business.
if there's anyone, I suppose, truly and purely in it for the justice, it would be the jury.
you.
I've always felt that intrinsic to justice is humanity.
humanity couldn't call for this young man to be locked up.
it simply couldn't.
I've sat with this kid.
he's a good kid.
he's...
Malcolm Davies is a bright young man with a future.
he also has a drug problem.
he needs help.
he can get it and go on to do wonderful things.
that won't happen if you find him guilty.
cause he'll go to a place that neither treats, nor trains, nor rehabilitates.
by the time he gets out, it's...
these are the kids we're losing.
we throw them away.
one "not guilty" vote buys me a hung jury.
which, in turn, might net a plea of a suspended sentence.
and Malcolm gets to stay in college.
all I need is one vote to save his life.
one.
they say it takes a village.
we're always hearing that.
it's time for the village to step up.
what are you doing here?
well, truth be told, I wanted to see if you were any good.
all rise.
case number 1138: The State of Ohio vs. Damien Winslow.
be seated.
morning, Your Honor.
defense waives reading; asks that all charges be dismissed, in that my client was acting out of necessity.
he was coming to the aid of Mr. Fung Lao, whose Laundromat was in the process of being robbed at gunpoint.
guilty or not guilty.
those are your two choices.
not guilty, Judge.
okay. Question... - And I ask that all charges be dismissed, in that my client was acting as a Good Samaritan.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
first case, counsel? - No, Your Honor. As if.
well, the way this works is we go through a little fact-finding process...
the facts aren't in dispute.
my client walked in on an attempted armed robbery.
the legal defense of "necessity..." - Hold on.
your Honor, sometimes in the interest of judicial economy, and convenience to the witnesses, cases can be expedited.
counsel... - Trials are expensive.
they can bankrupt rich people.
as for the poor, forget it.
this could cost Damien Winslow his house, if only he had a house, which of course he never will. Why?
cause he's poor. - Counsel.
as for the witnesses, they're here today.
we can get this thing over with.
how many here for this case?
look at that.
unbelievable.
is that not unbelievable?
am I to understand... All these people?
every last one of them.
all clients of Damien Winslow.
they're not witnesses to the crime.
they certainly bear witness to the need for the services being rendered by my client.
without him, their places of business get robbed.
counsel, this is an arraignment hearing.
Yes, but these people are here now, Judge.
they're not relevant... - "Not relevant"?
is that what you just said? - come on.
cause that's the real issue, Judge.
poor people are not relevant. - Give me a break.
how about we give the disenfranchised a break?
these people get nothing.
not even respect. Why?
maybe 'cause they don't seem to be relevant.
well, they are to Damien Winslow.
you want to lock him up, then what?
who's going to protect Fung Lao and Melissa Gove,
martina Sanchez, Willie Abrams look at them all, Judge.
they've come crawling out like ants at a picnic.
who knew these people even existed?
Damien did.
add to that, he cares.
we're talking about basic human services.
they don't get health care.
they don't get education.
they can't even get adequate police protection, and when someone tries to help them, watch out.
Mr. Branch, you're out of order. - These people are Americans.
you're out of order.
you're out of order.
this whole thing is out of order!
something is really wrong!
Mr. Branch!
guilty or not guilty?
not guilty.
just one question.
what drug are you on?
sorry.
once I get going... - What was the point of that, really?
well, to be honest which I'm not always it was to show you this will be a war, if necessary.
I actually believe in this guy.
no, you don't. - I really do.
look, we should win on the shooting.
it was justifiable defense of others.
he shot a guy that was committing an armed robbery.
as for the weapons charge, I'll plead to that.
that's really the right result here.
so let's just get there.
can we?
okay.
she's at least open to discussing a plea, which is a very good thing.
you told me the old lady was in trial.
I saw her sitting in the back.
she is in trial.
she just... Did you not hear me?
the DA is open to a plea.
you could skate here with no jail time.
Yeah, I heard you, man.
Thanks.
we done for now?
done. - Cool.
man. Watch where you're going.
what the...? But you took off, you left.
does it look like I left?
I don't get the right to come back?
what's up with that?
that ain't right, Slick.
did you forget something?
maybe I did, okay?
I just wanted...
I've been arrested before, you know what I'm saying?
had my share of lawyers, but...
none of them ever fought for me like that.
ever.
I just wanted you to know that.
okay.
be cool
one year in jail give it to you right now. Right now.
well... - What's to think about?
it's his third offense.
he could get three years, maybe more.
the thing is, he's in college.
if he gets any time, he's going to get kicked out.
you still want no time?
you kidding me?
as I said to you before, I'll say it again.
this kid needs a break.
counsel, look, I realize you have limited experience in the criminal justice system.
and I'd really appreciate it if you'd cut the condescending crap.
it makes you come off bald.
this is how you ask for a favor?
no, I asked for a favor rather nicely, and you responded with some patronizing bull.
look, I offered you one year.
that was a gift.
your client has no defense.
he's going to be found guilty.
and I'll tell you this, if you don't take this deal, if you don't recommend it to your client, he'll likely have a claim of malpractice against you.
piece of advice.
in your new line of work, kids like Malcolm Davies dime a dozen.
as soon as you're done with him, another one walks through the door.
and with all your cases, you need to not only safeguard the client, but yourself.
otherwise, you're a casualty.
trust me on that.
a casualty.
a big carcass that the victims in the system will pick at.
Mr. Peyton, if I ever surrender to that kind of cynicism, then I'm already a casualty beyond measure.
one year.
take it or leave it. Yeah?
take it or leave it fast. Jury's back.
leave it.
suit yourself.
madam Forewoman, the jury has reached a unanimous verdict?
we have, Your Honor.
what say you?
in the matter of the State of Ohio vs. Malcolm Davies, on the charge of possession of an illegal controlled substance, we, the jury, find the defendant Malcolm Davies...
please, please, please...guilty.
I'm sorry, Malcolm.
we knew this was a long shot.
Malcolm Davies, you have been found guilty by a jury of your peers of a class-two felony.
it is the order of this court... - Wait, wait, wait, Judge.
if you're about to sentence my client, I certainly wish to be heard.
the defendant is sentenced to two years in state prison.
your Honor... - Said sentence to be suspended in its entirety, pending Mr. Davies's successful completion of a drug rehabilitation program.
your Honor, this is his third offense.
you kidding me? You kidding me?
ms. Korn... check with probation, then your client is free to go.
son... do not let me down.
we're adjourned.
what... What does it mean?
no jail.
it means no jail.
Really?
you can't mess this up, Malcolm.
he's giving you another chance.
you need to make this work.
I will. I will. - All right.
I'm not a hugger.
I'm not a hugger. Okay.
okay.
okay.
no jail at all?
how do you figure?
well, as I said to the jury, all I needed was one.
the one I got was the judge.
okay. They look stunning.
you don't think they make my feet look too fat?
Oh, my God. No.
they are to die for.
is everybody done with the pizza?
Yes, and then you can help Adam box up his stuff.
that'll be your first official assignment as our new paralegal.
what do you mean?
I mean, I've finally landed on my feet.
you can go back to your cushy, shiny firm and... - Are you kidding me?
I don't want to go back.
why would I want to go back?
this is the most fun I've ever had.
yesterday, I stuck my finger in a guy's leg.
I want to stay.
permanently. - Don't be an idiot.
you have a brilliant future at any firm you want.
don't squander it.
I want to be here. - The answer is no.
look... I'm gonna just say this.
I never had a mother.
she died during childbirth, when she had my older brother.
I never... I... I suppose I look at you as my dead, crippled mother.
Oh, yeah, she was crippled, too.
she died during childbirth when she had your older brother?
let's go with younger brother on that, yeah.
better. We'll keep crippled.
Harriet, look... every day I go to work in that big firm,
I see the deadened eyes of all the partners that...
I sit at my desk, and I say to myself,"This ain't it.
this can't be it.
from the moment I walked into this stupid... I just knew.
this is it.
I really want to stay.
the thing is... you really do bug me.
Harry, you said things don't happen for a reason.
but they do.
when Malcolm jumped off that building, bounced off that awning, and landed on you, and when Adam hit you with his fully-loaded Mercedes, it was to bring the four of us together.
help you, gentlemen?
yeah... We're looking for a lawyer.
Damien Winslow told us about you.
we invented a... I don't know, a kind of doohickey.
a doohickey?
Yeah, it could open, like, any car.
originally used for criminal purposes, but Damien said if we just get a patent, we wouldn't need to be robbing cars.
it's a door-opener doohickey.
Jenna will take down all your information.
great.
can I get for anybody any tea, coffee, perhaps? - Look at that.
three more clients.
you'll have a full caseload by the end of the week.
this is home, Harry.
we're home.
you're gonna need to fill out your time sheets every day.
time sheets?
whoa, I never said anything about working for you.
like hell, we will.
you'll be a junior associate.
no, no, no, no, no. - Yeah, yeah. Or there's the door.
Harriet, life is richer with a partner you can really share your successes with, right?
I guess the moral of this story did come in the middle.
as Jenna and Malcolm said, sometimes things do happen for a reason.
you could say that I didn't just get it till the end, except this really wasn't the end at all.
for the four of us, this new and ridiculous firm, perhaps even my life, I have a feeling we're only at the beginning.
so this is what you do? I break up with you, and you committ...
I don't even know what this is your committing.
I switched jobs.
go get your real job back before it's too late.
this is my real job.
I'm Tommy Jefferson, kid. I chew lawyers up and spit 'em out.
he's gonna treat you like you don't exist.
your best bet is just interrupt him at every turn.
he's got a temper, and he's been known to completely blow.
you little snot! - Don't call me little!
you were rude to me. You ridiculed me. Nobody does that, u nothing little bug.
will you represent me? I'm facing prison.
I got arrested on a drug charge third offense and,
I got a cocaine problem.
your old life was that of a drug addict.
you have to turn your back on that, all of it.
if you need to talk to us, we're all here.
she's really working in that neighborhood?
police don't really respond to a alarms in this neighborhood.
the merchants tend to be burglarized and vandalized at an alarming rate.
you protect me and my place, my law firm will defend you for free.
I think I became terminal in my late 40s.
nothing the doctors could find, you couldn't see it on an X-ray.
but I was dying.
being put to death quietly, systemically, by routine.
I finally died last year.
you need to close up shop for a couple days.
what? Why?
couple of local gangs are beefin' with each other, know what I'm saying?
might be some bullets flying and it'd be better if y'all weren't around.
shooting? Like, at us? - What gangs?
Linkwood crew's one, Boone Park's the other.
well, what is this beef about? What the hell is going on here?
told you all I know, sugar.
well, who told you?
see, it's like this. See, Dewayne, he runs with Linkwood crew.
got this girl named Shonda, they broke up.
so Dewayne finds out that Shonda's hanging with C. K.C. K.he runs with my boys.
that's Boone Park?
Yeah. So Dewayne, he goes and get his boys and they go and torch C. K.'s ride.
C. K.was, like,"Man, I'm gonna need 12 grand for that."Dewayne be, like,"No.
so now Linkwood is beefing with us. It's gonna get bad.
is Dewayne going to hurt Shonda?
Naw, he don't give a...Naw, he got a new girl.
ain't even about the girl no more.
it's about respect.
I gotta go. Thanks for the ice cream.
it's true, - you really got him into college?
I did not. He got into college himself.
so two gangs have a ridiculous minor property dispute like this one, they start shooting?
not always. They got this thing here called street advocates.
they try to fix situations like this.
there was a street advocate assigned to this area, but he dead now.
did they kill him? - Allergy.
man ate a bad peanut. But dead is dead, you know what I'm sayin'? So we, like, between mediators.
all right. As of right now, they have a new mediator me.
I don't think they gonna go for that.
well, you don't know till you ask them.
Naw, see, some things you do know before you ask.
well, put it to them like this: I'm gonna be sitting in front of my store window with my. 44 in my lap.
if someone starts shooting at anybody, I'll consider it directed at me.
I'm gonna shoot back.
so these beefing gangsters are gonna get their asses shot up, or they're gonna murder an old white lady with lots of friends in the criminal justice system, friends who will insist on the death penalty for the shooter and his accomplices - because I am one adorable mother... - Harry
wait. No. No!
No!
you wanted a number, I gave it to you.
$626, 000. - That's my number.
saw that. Unacceptable.
do you mind telling me how you got to that figure?
I got it due to lost wages, loss of future earnings, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of consortium.
many things go into a Tommy Jefferson number.
loss of consortium? - He's depressed. Affects his love life.
look...
no, you look.
I asked you to look first.
your client wrongfully terminated mine.
that's a fact. That's a given. That's a reality.
one which you're not gonna change by bringing in rude boy.
think I don't know why you recruited him? I know why.
you brought him in to push my button. Nobody pushes my button.
I don't even have a button. $626, 000. That's my number.
your client made $81, 000 a year. He's 72 years old.
there's no way that lost wages together with loss of future earnings will ever, ever reach the present-day value of that number you're throwing out.
your client fired an old man for being old.
the jury will hate that.
they will punish him, you know it, I know it, so does the bug.
there's no wand to wave, no button to push, no card to play.
you have a dog case.
your client's worst nightmare would be for a jury to get its hands on this.
ask the bug. - Tommy...
don't flirt with me.
you want to flirt with me, do it in a bar.
do it in a hotel lounge. Do it on my boat, but not in a settlement conference. $627, 000.
it's 27 now. - Surcharge for bringing in a bug.
I tack on for bugs.
I saw that. Unacceptable.
$340, 000. That's our final offer.
let the nightmare begin.
I think you're gonna have to eat this one, Adam.
I'd cut your losses now and get out.
you done for the day?
no, trial starts this afternoon.
you the Jew?
what did you just say?
Jew" is a slang. It just means "lawyer.
Yes, I would be the Jew.
I'm the Jew.
all right, cool. 8:00, here.
fine.
by the way, no guns.
everyone will be frisked at the door.
I think I sold that old lady some weed.
what?
see? They're getting along better already.
Harry, the people that'll be here tonight, a few of 'em, maybe all of 'em, have killed people.
8: 00. Bangers in the house.
I don't like that she brought in that bug.
it's not that he threatens me, it's that she would think I have a button, that he would know how to push it.
I don't like that.
Tommy Jefferson has no Achilles' heel.
Tommy, you're personalizing. You don't do well when you personalize, do you?
look at me. What did we say on the ride over?
I would be Tommy Big-Boy today.
the facts of this case sit with us. Just keep your focus.
look, would you like me to try to rattle him?
I don't care about him, he's a bug. Rattle her.
I'm attracted to you.
I just thought we should put that on the table.
it'll have no bearing on the case, but in the spirit of full disclosure, certain types leave me damp; you're it.
my client's willing to come up to $410, 000.
that's a little harder to say no to.
no.
well, he was honest about it, I'll give him that.
what exactly did he say?
he said he was scaling down the operation, he needed to let some people go.
he said,"Gerald, you've run your race. You need to let the younger employees run theirs.
did he fault your job performance?
just the opposite. He said I was exemplary.
that's what you said, Allan. Exemplary.
so basically, he fired you for no good reason.
awful, must have been wrenching.
you're damn right it was wrenching.
46 years I was there. It was my whole life.
and I get kicked to the curb 'cause I'm too old.
it's not right.
no, it isn't. It's horribly wrong.
first of all, I am sorry.
I remember when my grandfather lost his job.
perhaps you could write about it in your book.
I was...
you're living on a fixed income. What do you have, Social Security?
I get Social Security, yes.
a pension?
that doesn't mean he can fire me for being too old.
I understand that, sir. I'm just trying to get a sense of the hardship.
do you have a pension?
Yes.
how much do you get from your Social Security and your pension?
I get about $2, 200 a month.
is that the extent of your income?
this is not just about income, young lady.
I understand.
do you have other income?
I get some stock dividends.
worth about how much?
Oh, it works out to about $8, 000 a year.
okay, so that's about $35, 000 all in. And forgive my intrusion, but do you have a savings account?
this isn't about money.
you've sued for lost wages and future earnings, and yet you testify this isn't about money...
objection.
of course this is partly about money, but.
I'm talking to him now. I'd be happy to get a drink with you later.
good, can I come?
Yes, let's all have a party after the trial, but for now, let's just get through this.
may I be heard, Your Honor?
sir, when you're sitting in that witness chair, it's all about you being heard.
I have suffered economic loss.
but more than the money, my life was about waking up and going to work.
a man needs a purpose.
and by purpose... - I'm not finished.
I gave my life to this company.
I worked hard for a fair wage.
this job, it...it's all I had.
I sit here now with nothing but time on my hands.
what am I supposed to do?
where am I supposed to go?
are we good? Everyone in here is clean?
good.
Harry. You didn't have to bring out a gun.
come on, calm down.
thank you.
any more outbursts, you'll hear more of that.
all right, so...who's who?
Boone Park is on that side.
Li'I D will speak for them.
Linkwood's on that side. Keshawn will speak for them.
and the two guys who are having the dispute?
it's Dewayne from Linkwood. Dewayne.
and C. K.with Boone Park.
got it. And it's C. K.'s car that was damaged?
damaged? You tripping. That ride was done.
yo, watch your mouth, man.
he lucky he wasn't in it, you feel me?
what you say, son?
guys, guys, come on, we here to talk.
we didn't come here to fight.
calm down!
it broke my heart to fire Gerald.
he's been a valued, loyal employee.
my father hired him.
he began mowing grass, landscaping. Worked his way into accounting and sales.
and he was good.
but...?
but I had to trim my workforce. I was hemorrhaging money.
and the trimming you did involved your older employees?
Yes, but what it really came down to was economic need.
the young guys and women had families.
tuition to swing, mouths to feed.
they were scraping just to avoid getting foreclosed on.
gerald owns his home outright.
he has a great pension, stock dividends.
bottom line, he was better able to absorb being laid off, at least financially.
did you ever consider the difficulty for a 72-year-old to reenter the labor force?
I did consider that.
what about our state budget mess?
think we should start brooming the older judges?
come on.
did you consider the psychological damage it might cause Mr. Essex to be put out of work?
I know it had to be tough.
you know how? You read about it? You consulted psychologists?
I don't have to consult with anybody to know this was going to be difficult.
gerald has financial security, which most of my employees don't have.
not my question.
what, if you don't like my question, you're going to answer one of your own?
objection.
Mr. Jefferson.
you say you considered need in deciding who to fire.
did you consider fairness? Basic fairness?
like if a man gives 46 years of his life, if he's loyal, if he works hard every damn day, that doesn't count?
that doesn't count?
of course it counts.
you had 11 employees who had worked for you under a year.
you kept them, but this man you fired because he's old.
you think I want to be losing money?
do you think I want to be firing people? I had to.
we all have to make sacrifices, for God's sake.
and you decided to sacrifice the employee who had given you the most?
look, man, your boy's out of line, and you know it.
he wasn't out of nothing. You don't even care about that girl.
that don't matter if I was done with her or not. - Hold on, nobody talks unless...
what I'm saying is... - Quiet.
I'm making a point!
I said shut your mouth.
Harry, take it down a notch.
this is the only notch I know.
let's continue, one person at a time.
my point be this if anybody be out of order it's this punk when he decided to torch C. K.'s car.
my turn? - Go.
here's what it is.
it's about respect, you feel me?
he knew he should have stuck to Shonda, but he did it anyway.
time out.
I know you all have your own jargon, but I don't talk legalese to you, so please don't speak gangster-ese to me.
Harry, all he said was...
what he said he can say in plain English.
that is plain English.
you don't understand what I'm saying...
that was plain enough.
if you don't understand...
hold up.
you're going to bust an eardrum with that thing. Put it down.
give us a minute.
you need to lighten up a little.
no, I need to be able to understand what they're saying.
ask me and I'll tell you.
check this out. We come to an agreement on something.
this here's not gonna work.
what?
at least not with you. You're out.
what do you mean I'm out?
you're a terrible mediator, lady. You're out. He's in.
What?! - What?
look, you just don't get it, lady. We think maybe he does.
I'm the mediator. - No, you're not.
we'll be back tomorrow 8: 00 a. m. Be ready.
do not scream. You hear me?
I'm not going to hurt you. I just need you to listen to me.
do not bite me. I don't like when people bite me either.
I ain't gonna rob you or nothing, I promise.
I just need to talk to you.
that is not the way to initiate a conversation.
sorry. I heard you pack.
I want to get out of Boone Park.
I want to go to college like that Malcolm kid.
I told you, I didn't get him... - It's not about that.
I just need you to help me get out.
well, what's the big deal? Just say you're out.
in which case, they'll kill me.
come on.
you're the mediator.
I just need you to help me get out.
actually, I'm no longer...
they'd really kill you?
lady, read my lips they...will...kill... me.
no, no, no, no, no!
calm down.
No! Harry, you cannot do this.
getting someone out of a gang, that is way, way over your head.
you cannot.
first of all, they probably would kill him.
it's definitely a possibility. - I cannot believe...
believe it.
my brother was in a gang. He wanted to get out. He...
if you try to do this, then you can forget about us mediating the other thing.
cause our trust, our credibility...
helping kids leave gangs is something mediators do.
the ones with experience, maybe.
and most of them, ex-gang members themselves.
this is way beyond the expertise of a patent lawyer.
just handle the dispute we got on the table, please?
hello. Welcome, welcome.
I took the liberty of making little name tags to make things a little easier.
little D. That's for you. You're not little. Funny.
C. K.That's for you.
Dewayne, here you...No? Okay.
maybe we should bump up the offer.
the client refuses.
Rachel, we're getting a little thrashed here.
not to criticize, but you didn't exactly rattle Tommy much.
you're blaming me?
no. I just...
look, it's not over. Our client is sympathetic.
it's just the plaintiff is... - is way so more.
if we close well, we are still in it.
how's Chunhua doing?
better. A lot better actually. Thanks for loaning out Thomas.
it's the least I can do after you've helped so much with this case.
I'm kidding.
seriously, do you have any ideas?
well, Tommy's done a good job of framing the question, why him just because he's old.
we need the question to be, why does he get tenure just because he's old.
okay, so I think I've got the basics of the situation.
Dewayne, how long you and Shonda going out?
I don't know, man...a few months, something like that.
When'd you break up?
little, bro, I don't really know all these damn dates.
it was a while ago.
besides, bottom line, he don't get her.
no matter what...
so you set fire to his car.
whatever.
okay. C.K. There's sort of an unwritten rule about dating ex-girlfriends from another gang, right?
Yeah.
$12, 000 for your car? How you get that number?
it's what I paid.
that's because you were suckered.
put it down.
not now, bro.
Harry, put yours down.
not until... - Put it down now.
now you. Give it to me.
give it to me!
give it to me.
come on, let's go!
anybody else got a gun?
do something!
has anybody else got a gun?
ten seconds immunity.
cause if I find otherwise, you won't like my ruling.
ten seconds.
all right. A one hour cooldown, then we continue.
we don't need an hour.
maybe I do.
kid, you better make this work.
cause if not, there's gonna be blood.
and it's gonna be on your hands. You understand?
I just came from the CIRV offices. You know CIRV, right?
Yeah, yeah, Cincinnati Initiative to Reduce whatever. I heard of it.
well, they pretty much echoed what Malcolm told me, that this is way over my head.
Lewis, they can provide protection.
they have experienced people who can mentor...
I came to you.
got a feeling about you.
why does everybody get feelings about me?
look, Lewis, they have a lot of reformed gang members who can help the transition.
they're good at this, I'm not.
well, I can't help you.
do you want me to end up dead?
Lewis, I cannot help you.
C. K. How did you start going out with Shonda?
why that matter to you?
cause it does.
from the beginning.
look, man, I don't really remember, I just...
refresh your recollection, then.
well, I saw her one day coming out this store.
and I thought, you know, she'd be cool to hang out with.
so that's it, we started kicking it, no big deal.
I mean, I ain't want no drama, so I told her how it is, you know.
I told her where I was coming from.
I told that girl exactly where she fit in, in my life.
she was cool with it.
that's it. I ain't mean no disrespect.
so there was no call to go and torch that man's ride.
not your turn.
is that it? C.K.?
we all know the story.
lifeboat starts to take on water.
someone has the idea,"Hey, let's throw out all the old people.
that's exactly what happened here. Never mind the years of service, loyalty.
we want youth; you're out." It's disgusting how we treat our elderly.
as far as television networks go, if you're over 49 years of age, you're dead.
you don't exist. It's unfair, it's...indecent.
and what's worse, ageism in this country is tolerated.
giggled at, even. Make fun of the old. Why not?
discriminate, go ahead. Who cares?
imagine if we did that with racism, or sexism, or all the other "isms.
but ageism, knock yourself out.
gerald Essex gave Meade Landscaping and Design 46 years of his life.
he deserved better than to be fired because of his age.
there was no suggestion here that he could no longer do the job.
just the opposite. He was exemplary. But old.
and we don't like old, do we?
I asked the defendant, and he was stuck for an answer: where does that fall on the fairness graph?
I'll ask the same question of you.
might also throw in the two questions Gerald asked.
what is he supposed to do?
where is he supposed to go?
I actually like old.
I'd tell you about my grandfather, but I've been instructed by the court to put that in my book.
that lifeboat analogy. If you remember the story, the elderly were tossed overboard in order to save people. Mr. Jefferson left that part out.
my client had a bunch of drowning employees who would have lost their homes if they were put out of work.
some wouldn't even be able to feed their families.
so he chose to spare those workers and let go of the employees who were financially secure, employees like Mr. Essex, who had savings, who had Social Security, who had pensions, employees who owned their homes outright.
employees who, yes, happened to be older.
Mr. Essex deserved better, of course he did.
so do a lot of people in this economy.
let's not get carried away with this ageism nonsense.
the over-50 demographic they might be dead to the networks, but otherwise they're not doing so bad.
they control over eight trillion in assets, more than 70% of discretionary income.
they make up 82% of Congress, 100% of Supreme Court, 80% of CEOs.
they basically control government, the economy.
in short, old people rule.
if one group is getting especially slammed, it is the young.
for kids coming out of college today, it is a labor market depression.
they have to go back to living with their parents because there are simply no jobs.
so let's put Mr. Jefferson's outrage in perspective here.
as for this fairness graph, let's say you had to let go of one of two employees;
one wouldn't face any real financial hardship, for the other, it would be catastrophic.
what would you do?
that was the choice facing Allan Meade.
he chose to inflict less hardship. We should punish him for that?
Really?
any idea what you're going to do?
I got an idea, but...
my advice? - Nope.
I can't believe you got me into this.
you're going to get me killed, I hope you're happy.
I'm never happy.
was your brother killed trying to get out of a gang?
no. He was shot three times.
so he was meant to be killed.
no, if they wanted to kill him, they would've killed him.
Malcolm, look at me.
my father it should be said he was drunk at the time, but still he once said to me "there comes a time in every man's life when he stops letting life just happen to him, and he starts happening to it.
I have no idea what that means.
you just look them in the eye, every last single one of them, and you tell them what your ruling is.
not everybody can be as brave as you, okay?
you think I'm brave?
Malcolm, I got thrown out on my ass by my law firm at the age of 61.
I suddenly find myself old, fat, alone, unemployed, now practicing law in a shoe store.
that isn't brave, it's desperate.
most people my age, they resign themselves to just projecting their hopes and dreams onto their kids.
well, I don't have any kids, so I can't even do that.
no grandchildren to bounce on...
I got a friggin' shoe store in a ghetto.
but I'll tell you this.
I do get to project a little hope and a few dreams.
I do it with you.
you'd be surprised at how much hope I project your way, Malcolm.
you're an awesome kid. Now, I'm not your mother.
but I'm nevertheless going to say something to you that every parent says to his or her child at some point.
don't let me down. Or else.
cause they may kill me, too.
I was bad. - Tommy, you weren't bad.
Yes, I was. I was bad, bad, bad.
you weren't. - But she was better.
I don't like it when people are better. Nobody gets to be better than Tommy Jefferson.
you're not acting like Tommy Big-Boy now, are you? You're pouting.
because she was better.
you both were good.
that's not what I want to hear.
everything was going so well.
I don't understand.
look, she's a good lawyer. We knew that.
she must be a lesbian.
excuse me?
you bolstered her by flirting with her. That's what you did.
made her much better.
I saw that.
I don't do well against lesbians.
you made her better.
okay.
C. K.claims Dewayne owes him $12, 000 for destroying his car.
Dewayne says his actions were justified because C. K.broke the code by dating his ex-girlfriend Shonda.
C. K.Blue Book value puts your car at 8, 000.
I tricked it out. It don't matter.
the mediator finds in favor of Dewayne.
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!
I ain't done.
the mediator also finds that Dewayne has no claim whatsoever on Shonda.
Dewayne, you and Shonda are done.
she want to be with C. K. . she going to be with C. K. . that's it.
no, that's not it. Some codes don't get broken.
not by him and not by you, you understand?
I think you need to understand; that's my ruling.
it's either this or no ruling, and I'm done.
there's any blood, it's on your hands. You got that?
all you want is not to pay the money. You don't care about the girl, he does. This works.
the mediator has made his ruling.
we all cool?
we cool.
whatever, man.
Yeah. Cool.
then we're adjourned.
one second.
as you all made it so clear, I'm just the little old white lady who doesn't get it.
and I don't.
I'll admit that.
why you choose the life of gangs.
perhaps it chooses you.
maybe there's no choice involved at all, it's just a reality that...
but here another reality.
five, ten years down the road, you people, every single one of you, will either be dead or in prison.
dead or in prison.
you all cool with that? You can't be that stupid.
I know getting out of a gang is difficult.
but if any of you should choose to do so, I would hope the rest of you, as betrayed as you may feel, would respect that decision.
and if any of you want out, my door is open to help you.
that's a promise I'll make right now.
and here's another one.
if I hear that anybody tries to get out and ends up dead,
I will hunt the responsible person or persons down like a mad dog.
now we're adjourned.
what's the big deal?
you rejected that offer.
I'm talking to her, bug.
you never took it off the table. Bug.
I'm officially accepting now.
it's officially off the table. Now, if you want a hundred...
what? Bug. That's insulting, a hundred.
Mr. Jefferson, you want to take your seat now?
no, Your Honor. 300 as low as I'll go.
let me rephrase. Take your seat.
final chance. - Pass.
Mr. Foreman, has the jury reached a verdict?
we have, Your Honor.
what say you?
in the matter of Essex v. s.Meade Landscaping and Design, on the question of liability, we find in favor of the plaintiff.
of course you do. Tommy Jay, Tommy Jay. Nobody like me.
and on the question of damages, we order the defendant to pay the plaintiff $75.
what?
did he say $75? - Tommy Big-Boy.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury...
75 bucks? That's it?
it's a victory; you're still undefeated. Big-Boy. Big-Big-Boy now.
75 bucks?
essentially, the jury said it was wrong of you to fire him because of his age, but they understood why you did it.
shall I pay him now?'Cause I have $75 on me.
I'd wait on that.
okay. Listen, hey, thank you.
thank you both. - Our pleasure.
Thanks.
you won it, Rachel.
I know, but still. You wanted to be useful; it's the thought that counts.
I called, you came. Thanks.
not happy. - No.
seventy-five dollars?
according to Adam, Tommy is furious.
Adam is back to being a rude little bug.
of course he is.
this one was a paying client though, Harry.
we actually get money for this.
Harry. - What?
what?
who is it?
it's me.
thank you.
I I don't know how to...thank you.
are you being sarcastic?
no.
they just beat me.
they just beat me out, that's all.
I'll be fine.
had to be 'cause of what you said.
because of me opening my mouth, they-they must have figured out...
Yeah, I know.
but they also heard you.
I'm alive, right?
I'm...
I'm gonna go to college, just like Malcolm.
I don't know what else to say.
neither do I.
Lewis, I am so very sorry.
you really don't get it, do you?
I probably owe you my life.
no. I don't get it at all.
the thing about routine, when it kills you, it doesn't have to be forever.
if you can just get rid of it, and the hazy blur that goes with it, life can come back.
with all its glory, its pain.
how it can come back.
just ? one
okay.
well, well, well, decided to jump ship after all?
I came because you said you had an emergency of sorts.
Oh, right, I lied about that, sorry. I do have another case though.
a little over my head. Could use some back up.
what kind of case? - Phoebe?
is there a bathroom? - Yep, right straight through there.
Oh, this is Adam Branch, by the way. He'll be joining us.
Oh, okay, hi.
why does she look familiar?
uh, she was on that reality show, It Takes Two, the one that shoots here in Cincy.
she's the one whose husband took his life.
she's now being sued by the husband's family, whose trial is about to start.
she hired you? - People do hire me.
no, I just meant, it's a pretty high profile case for a solo.
well, she had another lawyer defending her but now she suddenly lost faith.
evidently, he wants her to settle. I'm meeting him after lunch.
join me? If I take this over, I'm going to need help.
Harriet's Law and Fine Shoes
excuse me, excuse me!
I was wondering if you could help me. - No, I don't know anything about the shoes.
you talk to the skinny people. - No, actually, I may need a lawyer.
I think the police might be after me.
see, I sort of ran away. - From what?
the jury I was serving on.
we were sequestered for two months during the trial, and we'd been deliberating for over...
Oh, don't tell me anything about deliberations. - Oh, okay. Sorry.
uh, but it got to the point where I just couldn't take it anymore.
Oh, did you tell the judge?
Yeah, I sent a note out, but all the alternates had been used up at that time, so he said I had to stick it out. But I couldn't. I just couldn't.
so, a few days ago...
a few days ago? - Yes...
Hey, free for lunch later?
uh, it's starting to be a busy day, Tommy.
got it.
so, a few days ago, I snuck out of the hotel and I left.
Oy. Who's the judge? - Uh, Judge Lester Babcock.
Babcock. Never heard of him.
he's that guy when he gets upset, he stands and he paces.
haven't they come looking for you?
I don't know. I've been hiding in my cousin's basement.
Brianna, I'll level with you, I've never even heard of anybody doing what you did, but my gut tells me you're in a lot of trouble.
thought I recognized her. - This case is all over the news.
she's the Runaway Juror.
my advice would be to turn yourself in immediately. - No. Uh-uh. I can't.
I can't go back there. - Brianna, you have to.
alone?
you want me to go back there without a lawyer?
I got it. - Can we get rid of that thing?
I turned it off. - Oh, no, you didn't.
pick up your iPad, Cassie.
pick up you iPad now, and look at me!
God, I love Skype.
let me talk to Ollie.
Hey, Harry, how's it going?
new rule: All conjugal visits end by 8 a. m. so you're in here by 9: 00.
I need you to do some research for me on criminal liability for skipping out on a jury.
Hey, Cassie.
I think they just threw me in the corner. Hello?
Hello?
were they naked?
you do not want a trial. - If the alternative is I plead guilty...
Tina, I never said that you should plead guilty.
Yes, you did. - That's a criminal term. You haven't been charged with a crime.
I keep telling you wrongful death is a civil action.
what I said, simply, is that you should settle.
which means admit that it's my fault that my husband killed himself.
if you go to trial you could easily be slapped with a million dollar judgment.
you will lose everything you have.
hold on a second. As far as assets, what are we talking about? You own a house?
Yes. Me and Eliot had a house and I have a little over a million dollars in the bank.
a million d... you have a million dollars? - Well, I get $70, 000 an episode.
eliot got 62-five, it's all community property.
so between you, you were making over $130, 000 an episode on this stupid show?
thanks for the compliment. But, yeah.
which is why I strongly maintain you should settle.
you will not make for a sympathetic defender.
this... is why I want to replace him.
do you know what this case was about, Ms. Korn?
Yes, Your Honor, it was a murder trial and...
it was about more than just a murder!
I stand corrected.
it was about extra sheriff's deputies, housing out of town expert witnesses.
it was about the costs of sequestration.
room, board, transportation. Laundry!
it was about six months of investigation.
three months of pre-trial proceedings.
two months of trial.
it was about $4 million.
and that's exclusive of the personal costs.
you seem upset.
Oh, do I? This trial was a wrenching ordeal!
we have testimony from victims who were beaten, raped...
their son was murdered.
it was enormously stressful for those witnesses to come forward, but they did.
the money, the time...
the huge emotional hardships on everyone connected with this case, and now we have to go through it all over again, and it is all her fault!
judge... I reviewed this file and it, um, it looks like you were headed for a hung jury.
that is not true!
it was ten to two to convict when she took off.
maybe in another day or two she would've come to her senses and we wouldn't have...
all you proved was that Lee Michaels was a bad guy.
you didn't prove... - I don't want to hear one word out of you!
don't yell at our client!
if you don't feel like it.
your client...
belongs in jail.
she's a criminal.
it is my intent to put her there. She's in contempt.
take her away.
actually, Judge, if you're gonna hold our client in contempt, she'd like her day in court.
what? - Due process.
she'd like to be heard on the contempt charge.
she wants a contempt trial, is that what you're telling me?
well, she certainly doesn't want to be locked up. - Fine.
you want a trial?
we'll give her a trial.
we'll get killed. - No, we won't.
Phoebe, I wasn't up to speed before on this show, I am now,
Tina makes that Snooki seem like a choir girl.
that's just how the show presents her. - But it's how the jury will perceive her.
until we change that.
do you realize how much media's gonna be in that room?
which we're not afraid of, right? - Phoebe, we're pretty good, but we're kids.
look, there are a few victims in this story.
our job will be to make the jury see that Tina is one of them.
have you seen this file? It won't be easy.
which is why I asked for back up.
are you in or out?
in.
my brother would've never, ever wanted to go on that program, or any reality show for that matter.
well, why did he agree to do it then? - Because she influenced him to.
she made him do it because she has this need to draw attention to herself.
a reality show was not his style.
okay, but he did go on one.
Yes, he did, after which he was the object of public ridicule, often at her hand.
she belittled him on national TV.
humiliated him, emasculated him... it was abusive.
eliot is not what we would call a lover.
if I was looking for a man to make all my fantasies come true,
I'm sorry.
no, I shouldn't.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you could play a hundred different versions of that scene.
she was unrelenting.
finally he just couldn't take it anymore. - Why do you think Eliot married Tina?
any idea? - Well...
I think that he was a bit spellbound, to be honest.
do you think he loved her? - Yeah, I think he did.
which made his pain so much more.
to hear the things that she would say about him, on television, no less.
did your brother ever get psychological treatment?
Yes.
do you know what for? - He had some esteem issues.
he was kind of a fragile guy.
which was another reason she shouldn't have abused him.
she knew about his psychological deficits.
did you?
I imagine his family had some sense of his psychological deficits.
did you ever try to stop him from going on the show.
I wish that we had.
I wish that we had.
how'd you get this case? - I told you. It's Phoebe's.
well, why would she call you instead of me? I am a reality show.
Yeah, maybe you're too on the nose. It figures to last two or three days, tops.
Adam, you sure you want to do this? You could walking into a firestorm.
give it to me, I'm good with firestorms. - You're in trial with me, remember?
Yeah, I'd rather have his. - Well, you don't get it.
What'd you find out? - Not much.
not a whole lot of precedents with runaway jurors.
end of the day, you're gonna be at the mercy of the judge.
that's what worries me.
this judge's cup doesn't seem to runneth over with mercy.
you contact the shrink? - There's nothing wrong with me.
for our expert testimony? - Oh, yeah, we're all set there.
his case should have come to me. - Tommy.
I never should have married you! You ruined my life!
this is me stepping on you, 'cause you're a bug, you're a smashed bug under my shoe, that's what you are.
you married these.
this is what you married.
you said "I do" and "I do" to two s, and I am more than just two s, Eliot!
all this gets admitted next and then a lot more of the same.
you have to understand, they kept all the lowlights.
there were highlights, too...
not as many of them, but they made me look worse than I am.
whenever Eliot and I were being nice to each other, they would stop rolling.
look, we have a defense, but our first line is your testimony.
if the jury is to see you in a different light, it starts with you on the stand, which is why, over the next six hours, the three of us are going to spend a little quality time.
you forget how much you take for granted...
all the little things... being able to go outside, make a phone call, watch TV, read the paper, see other people. I couldn't see my friends, my family, my boyfriend, nobody.
it was all just starting to wear on me, I guess.
and could you tell us about the events leading up to your running away?
okay.
from the start it was clear that there were eight votes for guilty and four for not guilty.
I was one of the not guilty votes, and then two of the not guilties caved in, so then there were just two of us left holding out.
so we'd be in there and we'd talk and we'd take a vote, and then they would just start in on us.
so you ran? - Not yet, but at one point someone... I don't know who... said, "No one is going to hurt you," and that really got to me, you know, the fact that hurting me was even mentioned.
so you ran? - Not yet, but my anxiety was getting worse with all the pressure that they were...
Oh, God.
at one point I, I thought about suicide. - And then what happened?
a couple of hours later they came to get me and they brought me to the courthouse to see him...
you... in chambers...
and he...
well, you told me about all the time and the money that had gone into the trial and how there weren't any alternates left and how it would be a shame to have come this far and to go home without a verdict, and I just started to feel sick because I could see what was happening.
and I told him...
I really think I'm going to die if you don't let me go.
and you said to take some deep breaths and to relax.
and I could just see he wasn't taking me seriously, that they cared more about their trial than they did about my life.
and then? - I ran.
and you can see how you caused a great deal of hardship by running away.
I have never run away from anything.
I am a fighter, but my life was falling apart, I had hit my breaking point.
I am... sorry, I am so sorry,
your Honor, but...
...but I had to go.
can't we all just wait to hear（"IT TAKES TWO" SUICIDE SCANDAL
what the lovely reality TV whore "Tina" has to say?
I'm sure she'll play the victim, all the while loving the attention...
the news trucks parked outside the courthouse, the lights, the microphones, blah, blah, blah.
press treating you okay?
what were you thinking, taking this dog? - That's a very good question.
if I were the Ohio prosecutor, I would file murder charges and haul in...
I got to go.
I'm late. ...those producers and charge them with aiding and abetting.
let's lock 'em all up and let them rot.
I got to go.
eliot never once expressed not wanting to do the show, at least not initially.
well, according to his sister, he told her that.
look, we both discussed the pros and the cons.
the negative was being exploited. The positive was the money.
we needed the money. And, yes, the attention...
the idea of being TV stars... was very attractive.
did he want that as much as you? - Probably not.
but did I ever pressure or browbeat him? No.
well, in those clips you did seem quite aggressive.
they shoot hundreds and hundreds of hours.
they don't use most of it, but when we would argue, obviously that makes it in.
they want the drama, plus... - Plus what?
well... we all play it up a bit.
we know what they're looking for.
we know why they've chosen us to be on the show.
is it faked when we argue? No.
but do we embellish and exaggerate our feelings? Yes.
if we don't make an impression, we get cut from the cast.
Tina, I'm gonna be honest. You did seem like a bit of a monster.
I realize that.
did you have any sense that he might cause harm to himself?
Oh, God, no.
I admit, Eliot would keep things bottled up inside, but there was, like, never any sign that he would slit his wrists.
and you said that initially he didn't resist going on the show.
did he resist at some point?
why would we leave now, when we were just starting to get paid?
you convinced Eliot to stay, isn't that right?
we both agreed to stay on, and they probably would have kept me anyway 'cause I was the most popular character.
because you were the bitch, the one everyone loved to hate.
that seemed to be true then and it seems so now, Mr. Choi.
and being the bitch meant verbally abusing your husband in front of a national audience?
eliot and I could get into it on our own, but, yes, as I said,
I would ratchet things up for the cameras.
and you had an affair with another man on camera.
it was not an affair. I kissed a man while I was inebriated.
Tina, you're married.
not tonight I'm not. Oh.
I was very drunk in that situation.
I know that's not an excuse.
were you drunk here, too? - Yes.
I'm trailer trash. I'm not proud of it.
I drank too much and I did things I regret.
one of the reasons why I drank a lot is because the producers kept putting us in situations with alcohol.
they want us to drink a lot 'cause it makes for better TV.
so it's the producers' fault.
they made you kiss another man, they made you dance naked on the bar.
I didn't say that. They made you call Eliot a smashed bug.
I didn't say that!
you didn't call your husband a smashed bug?
I didn't say that the producers made me do all that.
no, they just gave you alcohol...
and that was enough.
the inner you came out.
at first I liked Brianna, I really did, but when we started deliberating...
she claims you all were furious with her.
we were. She held us up.
we all wanted to go home, we all wanted to see our families, only we couldn't because of her and the other holdout.
well, maybe she didn't think that he was guilty.
because she was out of her mind.
I'm sorry, I will not feel sorry for that woman.
she caused a lot of people a lot of stress. - Did you all pressure her?
Yes, to see reason, but she wouldn't.
truth be told, I think she wanted to punish us.
why would she do that? - We all thought she complained too much and some of us told her, so I think, to pay us back, she decided to just be obstinate and make everyone suffer, and she got her wish because, in the end, we all hated being there as much as she did.
did the other jurors become hostile to her?
maybe some, but she had it coming.
look what she's done... everybody loses.
Mrs. Flick, can we talk about some of the conditions during your sequestration?
they were horrible, but they were horrible for all of us.
she was the only one who took off.
that didn't go well.
Hey, listen, you did all you could with her.
so... now what happens?
well, uh, we'll put your doctor on the stand.
you ready with him? - Will be.
is it really fair that this judge is the decider on this?
I mean, he's got an ax to grind. Can he really be objective?
probably not, but he's the judge we got, Brianna.
I'm really looking at prison time, aren't I?
so are you saying we're beat?
we still have some witnesses to call, but, yes, I'm smelling a big disaster here.
this jury could be thinking, "At last, someone finally gets to give it to Tina."
if we can still get out for $500, 000...
no. I was the best thing that ever happened to Eliot. He told me so.
his life became exciting because of me, and he was the best thing that ever happened to me!
I loved him, and he's...
I will not be blamed for his committing suicide. It isn't fair.
you might lose your house. - I don't care.
I started with nothing, and I'll go back to that.
but I will not be labeled as the person who...
let's just keep going.
come on, Ollie. You don't share with your old friend Tommy?
you and Cassie.
she's a dynamo, isn't she? Yeah, she's got that look.
what look, Tommy?
Oh, Ollie and I were just... chewing the fat.
right, Ollie? - Yeah.
Tommy wants to know how you are in the sack.
you really need to ask? You know I'm good.
the question isn't whether it's good for Ollie.
the real issue is...
is it good for me? - Is it?
it's always very good for me, Tommy.
north, south, east, west.
it's always, always good for me.
you coming, Tommy?
No!
Oh. Yes.
careful.
inquiring minds. - Got it.
doctor, how well do you know Brianna Marsh? - Pretty well.
she's been my client for seven years.
without giving up too much privileged information, she suffers from anxiety.
she's prone to panic attacks, as well as bouts of depression.
was she going through any of that here?
she was going though all of it.
and on top of that, she was suffering from what some experts call "sequestered juror syndrome.
what? What the hell is that?
well, the symptoms include depression, restlessness, anxiety, despair, reduction of self-esteem, and actual cognitive impairment.
and what causes it?
Oh, it's complicated, but mainly sense of isolation.
some experts have likened it to people who have lived in Antarctica for extended periods, and go into a mild fugue state called the "Antarctic Stare.
Oh, please.
you're comparing jury duty to Antarctica?
jury duty could be worse, Judge.
researchers living and working in Antarctica undergo intense psychological pre-screening, and they still crack.
jurors undergo no such screening. We just pluck 'em off the street.
and often, we pluck the weak ones, because both sides are looking for people who they can manipulate.
what a load of crap.
doctor, you saw my client after she came out of sequestration?
Yes, and I can tell you, she was not herself.
she was often incoherent, her reasoning skills were significantly eroded.
her executive functioning was compromised.
she was a mess.
why is it she was the only one in this jury to suffer this jury sequestration syndrome?
she probably wasn't. She was just the only one who ran.
perhaps because, unlike the others, she was bullied.
were you in the room? - No.
I only know Brianna's account, which I believe.
you seem like a very capable doctor.
in the course of your practice, have you ever had a patient that had a loved one that was murdered?
Yes. One that was forced to endure a trial of the accused?
Yes.
what's that like, from your medical perspective?
it's vile.
these people...
the suspect in this case broke into their home, beat this man, raped this woman, and then murdered their son.
they sat in this courtroom for two months.
do we have a syndrome to attribute to their experience, Doctor?
no.
and because of that woman, they'll be to go through the whole thing all over again.
what do you say to them, Doctor?
"buck up"?
"stiff upper lip"?
and, Mr. Hessly, to get an idea how these reality shows work, first, how do you get the people you get to be in them?
well, we have an open casting call, and they come in droves.
and what are you looking for? - We're looking for colorful people.
train wrecks. - Okay.
Tina and Eliot... what did you see in them?
we saw in them a dynamic that, um... Well, she was a little over the top.
your casting note said, "loud and trashy."
he was repressed. Opposites of sorts.
it makes for good conflict.
Tina mentioned that the producers would also manufacture conflict if need be.
it may have happened. - Mind telling us how?
it's called "poking the bear."
we basically solicit a provocative comment from one cast member, play it for the other, and suddenly, we have a fight.
and those fights we see on TV... they're real?
real with the occasional use of frankenbiting.
Frankenbiting?
it's an editing technique. We take various pieces of audio and visual, we build the scene we want to build.
kind of like Frankenstein building his monster.
eliot is not what we would call a lover.
eliot is smart, and he takes care of me.
like, this one time at Halloween, I was dressed as a nun, and Eliot...
I'm sorry.
no, I shouldn't.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
okay, the point is, is that Eliot takes care of me. And if I had it to do all over again, if I was looking for a man to make all my fantasies come true, it's Eliot.
it's really Eliot. - Sound familiar?
we saw this clip earlier, only it played like this.
eliot is not what we would call a lover.
if I was looking for a man to make all my fantasies come true, Elliot...
I'm sorry.
no, I shouldn't.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
and there you have frankenbiting.
do you create a character out of whole-cloth?
absolutely not. We highlight.
inventing a character wouldn't be sustainable.
it wouldn't last over the course of a season.
so, the Tina we saw on television...
that's essentially her with a nudge from us.
a nudge? - For instance, we have footage of Tina spanking a male stripper in the rear with her bra.
that's not invented. That's who she is.
now, look, it's my job to take a five scene, turn it into ten.
I add some music, some reaction shots.
but essentially, what you see is who they are.
just combine that with the fact they know what we want, and they give it to us.
now, the availability of alcohol. Do you insist that the participants drink?
if they drink, it's because they want to.
we talked about Tina. What about Eliot?
eliot was a reluctant astronaut. - I'm sorry?
he was only in it because Tina wanted him to be.
we all hear the complaint.
I mean, how can juries seem so out of touch?
O. J. Casey Anthony.
are they seeing the same case we're seeing?
well, maybe they are, but through a skewed prism.
these people are shut away from their family and friends.
they're pressured and bullied by each other in an extremely confined environment.
one of reasons that we don't trust confessions is because people are cooped up and psychologically worn down to the point where they'll say anything.
well, that's our jury system.
the scientists who have studied sequestration have said that it breeds a kind of insanity.
jury of our peers?
it's more like jury of our whacked-out peers.
people crack. Brianna cracked.
she had emotional and psychological deficits to begin with.
anxiety, panic attacks.
she was prone to depression.
then she's isolated from her family and her routines, her support systems. She's bullied and battered.
no wonder she went nuts.
and now, you want to punish her and hold her in contempt, and throw her in isolation where she'll be subjected to rude treatment, crappy food and no privileges.
she just went through two months of that.
that's why she cracked.
so, when the going gets tough, we should just let the jury get going?
is that the answer? What she did was unconscionable.
you said it yourself, Judge.
so many people gave of themselves for so long, to finally get justice in a murder trial, And Brianna Marsh threw it all out the window.
the financial cost... over four million. The emotional cost...
immeasurable.
because she couldn't take the pressure. She was stressed.
Oh, come on. She was borderline suicidal, for God's sake.
you had your say!
Yeah, well, have yours, but please do not trivialize this, and do not misconstrue what I've said.
this was an extreme situation.
Yes, it was, especially for that family!
all right. - Your Honor, do we even bother to warn prospective jurors about the pressures that they face?
I mean, do they have the slightest idea what they're getting themselves into?
she had two months to get out if she couldn't hack it!
all right.
I've heard enough from each of you. - Thank you, Your Honor.
no.
I'll talk now. Everybody sit down.
ms. Korn, you are no doubt correct to question the validity of our jury system.
it seems that only when we get people mentally compromised enough do we say, "What say you"?
they probably should be prescreened or profiled to see if they're even up to the wear and tear of prolonged sequestration...
but we don't have the resources for that.
there is a lot wrong with the jury system, but it is our system, like it or not.
and the answer can never be for a juror to flee.
Mr. Odom is right... she could have got out;
we had alternates.
but once those alternates were all taken up and we were in deliberations, she had a civic duty to stick it out.
she didn't.
I find her decision to run was voluntary, and she will be held in contempt.
and... I shall ask the D. A.'s office to fee obstruction of justice charges forthwith.
we are adjourned.
I think the best plan would be to let the judge's wrath cool down.
you could be out from the contempt thing this week.
as for obstruction of justice, we again make the argument that your actions weren't entirely voluntary.
we're not done. Don't despair.
we're not done.
probably done.
Tommy! - I-I'm just saying.
it was unrelenting.
and it was on national television.
of course she had to have contributed to Eliot Stanhope's suicide.
who could stand up to that degree of... humiliation?
when we get married, we take a vow.
those vows may use varying language and different phrases, but at the core is always a promise to love, protect, cherish, defend.
Tina Stanhope took those vows and did the opposite.
she used Eliot Stanhope.
she willfully manipulated him into a situation rife with risk to his emotional state and reputation, and exposed him to crushing ridicule, all for her own vanity.
she may not have slit his wrists with that razor blade, but she incited the tragedy just the same.
her behavior simply shocks the conscience.
I certainly hope it shocked yours.
I have to admit, from the footage I saw,
Tina didn't seem like a very nice person.
but I think we're all smart enough to appreciate she was cast, filmed and edited to be the bitch that America would love to hate.
she was part of a television show. She played her role.
eliot played his.
and just like she did, he signed up for all of it.
he signed a contract allowing the producers to portray in the best interest of the series.
they did so.
for that, he was paid more than $60, 000 an episode.
this is reality television, folks.
the one thing that all of them have in common is they exploit the contestants for our entertainment pleasure.
and we are entertained, aren't we?
after all, we watch, we devour it.
the greater the humiliation, the happier we are as viewers.
all the producers need find is a few sacrificial lambs willing to make fools of themselves.
they found one in Tina. They found one in Eliot.
this one... had a tragic ending.
but it isn't the first time, is it?
Julien Hug, The Bachelorette, suicide victim.
Joe Cerniglia, Kitchen Nightmares, suicide victim.
Russell Armstrong, Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, suicide victim.
Najai Turpin, The Contender, suicide victim.
Wesley Durden, Next Great Baker, suicide victim.
James Scott Terrill, Supernanny, suicide victim.
Nathan Clutter, Paradise Hotel 2, suicide victim.
Rachel Brown, Hell's Kitchen, suicide victim.
eliot Stanhope, It Takes Two, suicide victim.
the list goes on and on. And will, because we watch.
we love it.
we want them to recruit psychological train wrecks like Tina and Eliot.
they entertain us.
it makes us happy to watch them self-destruct.
it would be nice to lay this all on Tina, wouldn't it?
sure is more fun than taking responsibility ourselves.
Yeah, let's go with "Tina's fault.
sounds good to me.
they lost.
what do you mean? - Harry and Tommy, they lost.
we should clear out of here before she gets back.
she's not a whole lot of fun when she loses.
not much fun when she wins, for that matter.
what do you mean? Harry's fun.
we talking about the same Harry?
what's wrong with your eyes?
how we doing, Cassie?
I hate Skype!
sorry about that.
okay, Madam Forewoman, you have reached your verdict by a preponderance of the evidence?
we have, Your Honor.
is that a good thing, "preponderance"?
what say you, then? - On the count of wrongful death, we find in favor of the defendant.
on the count of intentional infliction of emotional distress, we find in favor of the defendant.
on the count of negligent infliction of emotional distress, we find in favor of the plaintiff, and we order the defendant to pay damages in the amount of $120, 000.
I lost?
no, you won on the main counts.
this is good, Tina, very good.
what is up with Ohio?（JURY SIDES WITH TINA STANHOPE)
I can tell you, the state is spelled "Hi,
bookend by two big zeroes representing the people who live there.
I would have fed that Tina right into the wood chipper.
tell you what, "Ohio..." - Why does she put everything in quotes?
doesn't make any sense. - If they want to get high, get high on that.
people are not happy. - It seems not.
thank, Adam. That was an awesome closing.
every think you should be doing a little more of that, maybe less organizing secretarial pools?
I'm not leaving, Phoebe. I like where I am.
can't blame me for trying. I got another idea.
you come work with us. - I don't think so.
why not? You seem to like everybody there.
they all like you. We get great cases.
I like doing my own thing. - Fine, come do it with us.
you need community in your life.
I'll keep Ollie from trying to hump you from behind.
no promises on Lisa, but... Come join us.
think about it.
when you think about things, which, as you know,
I don't like to do.
we've basically got a system that breaks down the individual's powers of reasoning for the purpose of reaching a reasonable verdict.
that's one way of looking at it.
what's the other?
well, if you're trying to decide whether somebody broke a given law, you could ask a judge to decide, somebody who's trained in the law, or you could turn the matter over to 12 lunkheads who never finished high school and get their legal interpretation.
God, look at the two of them.
ten bucks says he tries to kiss her.
you're on. She's way too much for him.
doesn't matter; give him enough time, he'll try to kiss her.
I know my people.
speaking of which, Tommy, isn't it time you become one of my people?
what are you talking about? Well, we practice law together.
you visit our staff meetings.
we jump in on your cases, you jump in on ours.
I mean, I'm saying if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, should you become one of my ducks?
isn't it time our firms just merge?
Oh, hell.
all I ever really wanted...
really, to, uh, be part of a family.
you know?
I need another drink.
to quack for a team.
Harriet's Law and Fine Shoes
it had an iPod dock, satellite radio, voice-activated navigation system, um... Plates, make, model and color.
what about the VIN number?
I don't think that you guys appreciate the severity of my victimization.
this car is my eternal nucleus.
...a Malibu. With an iPod dock.
when you got hit by Malcolm, who was there for you?
when you got hit by Adam, who was there for you?
who is always there for you, always?
God? - Me!
close.
and when I'm need of just a little supportwhen I have been violated you...
can I help you? - You can't help me.
you're rude. Rude doesn't help me.
Harry, I need you. - Why?
how we doing, everybody? Came as soon as I could.
Hey. I know you. You're that Tommy Jefferson.
I seen you on TV. Man of the people.
Damien Winslow. I'm a man of the people, too.
Ah, you. I need you to help me get my car back, Mr....Person.
I need to hire Damien Winslow Securities, I-N-C.
sweet. - I have some pictures of it on my computer.
excuse me, please?
Harry, look, little problem.
what's that? - Albinos.
come again? - African Albinos.
they're being deported... perfect Tommy Jefferson case.
buttons to push, strings to pull.
what's not to love?
it's a home run for yours truly.
so what's the problem? - They make me nauseous.
albinos make you nauseous? - To look at. Ever seen one?
Tommy. - You know it's not like me to ask. For help.
I mean, why would I? I'm Tommy Jefferson.
but lives are at stake here. I'm battling a difficult law, a tough U. s. Attorney and nausea. It's a two-day trial, tops.
the Immigration court is in Cleveland.
we could stay over if you prefer, have a couple of drinks at the hotel.
I wouldn't ask, Harry, but you and I have a relationship.
look, Tommy, I've made very few promises to myself in life.
one was to never go to Cleveland.
please. These are good people. They need your help.
they need an attorney who can fight for them, one who can... look at them.
albinos are routinely murdered in Tanzania.
we left the country two years ago. We were making our way to Dallas.
there is a Tanzanian community there.
we got as far as Cincinnati before when we ran out of money.
okay. And how is it you got arrested?
I have all this information.
well, I don't.
we were staying in an abandoned house.
there was a raid. I-C-E must have been tipped.
I must say your English sounds pretty good.
that's not the Tanzanian language, is it?
it's mostly Swahili, but English is also spoken.
Plus, I also went to university in Boston, so mine...
how you doing? - He doesn't like to look at us.
okay, look, timing is everything, and yours stinks.
in the history of America, you picked the worst possible moment to be an immigrant.
and you should also know, it's hard enough getting asylum as it is, but getting it after you've been arrested, it's...
I don't mean to make you cry.
Harry, Albinos can't cry. Their tear ducts aren't fully developed.
who told you that?
what? - We are fully capable of crying, Mr. Jefferson.
trust me.
the man is unbelievable.
Malcolm, you can help him. - Okay.
good news, Jenna... I know who's got your car.
you do? Can you get it back?
no. - Well, see, from the point of view of the personor persons who took the car, it's their car now.
What?! Is he on drugs?
I set up a meet, Harry. I'm gonna need you or Adam to help.
can't. I'm off to Cleveland.
Harry! - Yes, I know, it's a Malibu.
Adam, you handle it. - I want to be present, too.
not a good idea. - Why?
cause clearly, you're too emotional. I mean, how could you not be?
the thing had an iPod dock.
don't think that I don't know when I'm being mocked.
I'm not. - Yes, you are.
look, suppose you did go.
what would happen if somebody came in here looking to buy a peep-toe-slingback, do-me-like-a-dog pump?
have you considered the tragic consequences of you not being here?
for your information, our shoe business supports our law practice.
I'm bringing in money while you're out there defending drug addicts for free.
and by the way, I've totally figured you out.
have you now? - Yes. You're a pretty bigot.
you were probably picked on in high school by the pretty girls who giggled as you stood by the punch bowl, waiting for some guy to ask you to dance.
you have a thing against the pretties, and I'm a pretty.
well, I can't help my looks, okay?
you got to go with what God gives you, and right now,
I can't go anywhere because I don't have a car.
okay, this just needs to be said. The girl is mentally challenged.
Harry? The U. S.Attorney just brought a motion to seal the room.
we need to get to Cleveland now.
look, I typically don't care whether a room is sealed or not, but given Mr. Jefferson's penchant for publicity,
I have serious concerns that he might try to...
a shot over the bow.
is that how we begin? Cause let me tell you, Red...
Tommy. - I meant no disrespect.
you're an excellent attorney. I certainly know this.
but you're also a notorious grandstander.
your Honor, he can say what he wants about me.
I can take it. I'm a big boy.
but the president of the United States, our commander-in-chief...
he has declared transparency to be in the national interest, in the White House, in Congress, in the courts.
so, if the United States government is seeking to ship a bunch of poor Albinos back to a place where they will face torture, then the American public certainly has a right to know about it.
Mr. Flynn's motion is granted.
what? Why? - Let it go, Tommy.
when you seal a room, you're suggesting you have something to hide.
I'd simply like to remind you of the president's mandate for transparency.
thank you, Mr. Jefferson. The motion is granted.
I'll, explain myself to the president should he call.
we recieved a tip that illegal immigrants were housed at the aforementioned address.
myself and several I-C-E Agents proceeded to raid the premises, upon which we discovered the respondents, all sleeping at the time.
our entry awakened them, at which point, they attempted to flee.
did you identify yourselves as federal agents?
Yes. That seemed to bring them little comfort. They all ran.
we managed to apprehend them.
upon asking for identification, it was determined that they had entered the country illegally.
at that point, we placed them under arrest as status violators.
is it fair to say that my clients became scared when you entered the house?
I would imagine they were scared, yes.
and, honestly, sir, if armed men suddenly charged into your house in the middle of the night, wouldn't your instinct be to flee?
excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt, but the fear they experienced during their arrest isn't really an issue before the court.
Mr. Flynn, you were careful to introduce that my clients attempted to flee.
you did so to establish their guilty state of mind.
counsel, if and when he makes that argument, you can then make yours.
your Honor, one last item, because I think it serves as backdrop as to what both this proceeding and the United States of America is.
I'll keep it short. Two words... melting pot.
I'll say it again. Melting pot.
thank you, Mr. Jefferson.
I'm touched, as I'm beginning to suspect, are you.
let's continue.
Tommy, maybe I should do this one alone.
am I off?
I don't quite feel myself. Am I off?
I'm out on bail now.
they say me and this guy Dwayne stole some TVs from Best Boy.
did you? - No, and I can prove that.
but see, I can't prove it. You follow?
I don't follow, and when do we get to the part about my car?
Jenna... See, at the time the TVs were being stolen,
I was somewhere else, but I can't exactly say where, you follow?
no. - You were stealing something from somewhere else.
I don't admit that, but if it were true, it would be a Mercedes 500 S class.
still not my car. - And when the cops got Dwayne, they told him to give up the guy he stole the TVs with.
for whatever reason, Dwayne gave up me, even though I was completely innocent.
can we just fast forward to Jenna's car, please?
I know where it is.
because you stole it.
what are you looking for, Jamaal?
I need a lawyer on the stolen TV thing.
a good one, not that lame public defender they hooked me up with.
Damien says you people are good.
so, basically, if I represent you on that, you'll return Jenna's car.
represent me for free.
and... you have to win.
I think that sounds totally fair. But may I offer one little tweak to the plan?
you return my car now, and I don't give your prints and your DNA to the police.
cops already got my prints.
Really? Well, do they have your digitally recorded confession?
that ain't the way this works. - Oh, yes, it is.
Jamaal, you seem like a good kid, but you stole my Malibu, and that pisses me... Jamaal... off. Comprendez parlez-vous, Jamaal?
you have pissed me off.
they use them to make potions.
these potions are supposed to bring prosperity, wealth and good luck.
there are Albino hunters who find albinosand... The hunters have machetes.
they hack off arms, legs...
and leave the person to die.
my cousins and I knew we had to leave Tanzania, or we would be killed.
the five of us made a plan to leave.
the five of you? - Benjamin.
he didn't make it out.
benjamin was...?
my brother.
what happened? - The night we were to leave, he was captured.
do you know what happened to him?
his arms and legs were cut off.
how old was Benjamin? - Thirteen.
the way my business works is on trust. I have a trust with the neighborhood.
my word has to be good with people.
my name is now trash 'cause of that little stunt you just pulled. You feel me, girl?
all right. - There's certain things you don't do.
you got that? - I think I do.
and one of them... we can now add it to the list... is steal my car.
well, you may not get your car back now.
and I don't know what will happen 'cause you just shot up all my trust in the neighborhood, That's what you just did.
may I help you? - My name is Denise Raines.
jamaal is my brother. The car thief?
what's going on?
jamaal said he was in some trouble, something about stolen televisions.
it's actually a little more serious. Your brother stole a car.
mine. Are you sure about this?
I have his confession and his DNA.
Jenna. - What?
I'll see that your car is returned. I'm very sorry.
you look at homeless people on the street?
I'm sorry? - You know?
you're walking down the street, homeless person sitting at the curb.
do you look? Make eye-contact? I don't.
they make you nauseous?
no. I don't look 'cause it depresses me.
not simply that they're homeless, but because I can't help.
not in the whole. I mean, sure, I should give the guy ten bucks, but 30 yards down the street, there's another one, and another one, and another one.
I don't look 'cause futility overcomes me.
same with your human tragedies worldwide. You got your Somalians, your Haitians.
today, it's the Tanzanians. I can't keep up.
there's suffering all over the world, Harry.
and I can't make a difference, and the futility of it all...
don't look at the macro picture, then.
maybe you can help just one.
or, in this case, our four clients.
that's futile, too, probably.
this is one lousy time to be an immigrant.
we're throwing out the Asians, the Indians, people who study at Harvard, Stanford, doctors, scientists...
we're giving them the heave-ho when it's in our national interest to keep them.
well, the issue isn't whether we want them.
it's whether they qualify for asylum.
come on, Harry.
cases always come down to what a judge or jury wants.
end of the day, it's what they want, and trust me, it ain't Albinos.
I'm going to admit something to you. Confidential.
it's not something I tell people.
I cry when I'm sad. These cases... they make me weak.
and for Tommy Jefferson, that's not something...
it's okay to be weak, Tommy.
Really? - Really.
I'm feeling shame over something I did.
what?
well... When the Albinos first came in to hire me...
mind you, I did not know their plight at the time...
I told them I was expensive.
I said... "Be prepared to pay an arm and a leg.
it's one of the reasons i can't make eye contact with them.
that, and... they're funny-looking.
I saw that.
you're trying not to laugh. I saw that.
Tommy Jefferson.
my heart goes out to you and the other respondents.
this isn't whether the United States government sympathizes. We absolutely do.
but I do have some questions. And I guess my first would be,
did you come to America to seek asylum?
Yes. Well, what took you so long to seek it, then?
you've been here two years. It seems to me that most folks who feel they qualify for legitimate asylum ask for it.
they don't wait to get arrested.
objection. - Overruled.
now, you came to America before, to study at Boston University, did you not?
I did.
and after you graduated, you chose to go back to Tanzania.
I find that curious, if you really faced this type of persecution.
I thought things had progressed. They hadn't.
forgive me, and I don't doubt that these atrocities do occur.
but are you using this persecution as a pretext to gain entry into America?
am I using it as a pretext? - Well, first, you chose to go back.
and then, you're here for two years with no apparent plan to seek asylum until you get arrested, and then, presto, suddenly you feel persecuted.
it is a little suspicious.
you actually think we're fabricating the persecution?
I just wonder if you overstate it. - I don't.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, I missed you so much.
my brother was afraid to return it. He thought he might be set up.
why would he think that?
last time he came here, he was set up.
look. I know you people made no deal to defend my brother, but... Well... will you? He's a decent kid.
he's just fallen into a bad crowd.
if only some lawyer would take a chance on him.
you can't relate?
Oh, so you did your homework.
I'll pay his legal fees, if that's your concern.
look, I'll ask them. Can't make any promises, but... I'll ask.
shifting gears a little, would you like to get dinner?
I'm a cultural attaché of the Tanzanian consulate.
as such, I am fully aware of the atrocities being carried out against the Albino people.
does the government of Tanzania condone this kind of persecution?
no, we do not.
Yes, there is horrific violence directed towards these people, but our government condemns it and prosecutes those responsible.
it is our duty to protect all of the citizens of Tanzania, including Albinos, and we live up to that responsibility.
these people, the ones running around, chopping off the arms and legs of Albinos, they've all been arrested?
certainly not all. - Most of them?
a lot. - Fantastic.
that's really swell.
how many trials have there been?
I would have to check the records.
I could not give you an exact number off the top of my head.
well, at least you still have the top of your head.
that's not something to be taken for granted in Tanzania, is it?
you think you're funny? - Not trying to be.
in fact, I take this matter very seriously. Does your Tanzanian government?
I just testified that it does. - It just seems, if you were really serious about ending the murder and dismemberment of Albinos, they'd be convicting more than a few of these vicious, sadistic monsters.
we have had some trials. We've obtained convictions.
we have called upon the people to report these Albino hunters.
and despite all these heroic efforts, the butchery still goes on.
one reason being, the people of Tanzania aren't really so against it, are they?
gang violence continues to go on in the United States.
should one, then, assume the American people are for it?
we certainly prosecute gang violence with more vigilance. - You cannot keep all of your citizens safe.
neither can we.
we don't need to flee our country in order... - Neither do Tanzanians.
that is precisely the point.
there are havens.
your clients did not seek them. They opted for the American dream.
if you would like to bestow that dream, I have no objection, but do not do so with bigotry and prejudice directed towards my country.
I know that if I could help him get his degree, and I can, then I could help him get into a Community College.
no offense.
but, uh... How does somebody from your neighborhood get to be a successful real estate broker at the age of 20?
I got lucky is what it was.
when I was 17, I got a job cleaning at one of those high-rise condominium palaces downtown.
anyway, they had a lot of vacancies, and I convinced the owner, who was also the general manager, to let me try and sell a unit one day.
how'd you do that? - I flirted.
I'm a good flirt.
anyway, at the end of the month, I had sold 12.
you sold 12 units in a month?
I'm a really good flirt.
I'm now the in-house broker for that building and six others.
the American dream is alive and well, Malcolm.
it's just harder to find.
I want to help my brother find it... before it's too late.
so, we close tomorrow, then the judge rules.
what do you think? - I don't know.
it's getting really contentious.
heard you got your car back. - Yep, I did.
wasn't stripped or... - Nope.
okay, stop it.
look... when two people, especially office colleagues, have a disagreement, it can cause hurt, pain.
finally, at some point, they air it all out, eventually make up and move on.
what I'd like to do, Jenna, is pretend we did all that nonsense, so we can be done with this crap!
you see that?
you so devalue me that you can't even be bothered with having a fight.
that isn't true. - Yes, it is.
you don't respect me. You hurt me.
you can't be bothered with trying to... I get it, Harry.
I get it.
you know what, Jenna? I am bothered... and a little hurt myself.
that little "Punch bowl" Remark.
I may not have been picked on by the pretties, but I did spend a lot of time at high school dances waiting for some boy to...
that hurt, Jenna.
I'm sure to you I may seem big enough to rise above it...
and I am; I've spent a lifetime rising above it...
but that doesn't mean the remarks don't hurt.
I'm sorry.
Harry, really, I... I had no idea that you were so... full of crap.
this devaluing of me has been going on for a long time, way before I made that "Punch bowl" Remark.
so don't try to use that as an excuse to justify all the abuse that you've heaped on me.
and if you are a person who seems to know that remarks cut deep, then why the hell do you constantly make them?
is there liquor in that friggin' room? Why does she keep going in there?
can I ask you a question? Got a girlfriend?
I'm sorry; too forward. Never mind. I get it.
do you?
no. You? - Have a girlfriend?
no, I... Who's calling me at... Sorry.
Hello? What?
Jamaal, damn it.
okay, don't talk to anybody, I don't care who pretends to be your friend, do you hear me?
what?
Denise, what?
he got himself arrested. He stole a car.
I'm sorry. - I don't know what to do anymore.
I... I don't.
okay. Just came from the D. A. 's Office.
the reason they haven't arraigned you yet, Jamaal, is you're not really the one they're after.
they want your boss. - My boss?
his code name is "Dick Cheney. " I love that.
they say you might be the only one who knows who he is.
who is Dick Cheney?
he runs a car-theft ring, a pretty sophisticated one, and your brother is evidently his first lieutenant.
that's a lie. - Oh, my God.
the offer is, you flip Dick, you walk.
I can't flip. Man's been good to me, you know what I'm saying?
plus. I don't know what he would do if-if... - Is he dangerous?
I don't know. He could be.
nobody's turned on him before. He could be.
well, you got to make a decision, Jamaal.
how much time do I have on this here? - well, I don't know.
you will get time, especially if they're looking to squeeze you.
three months, probably, could be six.
look, I need time to think about this. - Well, you don't have long.
if there's no deal, you'll be arraigned tomorrow.
let me just ask.
if he agrees to do this and this Dick Cheney is dangerous, - will the police protect Jamaal? - I doubt that.
then maybe it's best he just takes the three months.
you're talking about an unspeakable type of persecution.
as I said earlier, everybody in this room has to sympathize.
but... look, bad criminals exist everywhere.
consider Mexico... the, uh, drug cartels set their victims on fire, sometimes behead them.
the problem is, once we open our doors to every persecuted foreign national, well, you can watch the lines form.
homosexuals are still murdered in parts of Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, Saudi Arabia.
in Iran, you are stoned to death for adultery. Pakistan, too. Darfur? Forget it.
domestically, we are already hemorrhaging as it is... we can't take care of Americans.
we can't feed everybody here, can't house them, can't educate or employ them.
this country is an absolute mess.
one in seven people live below the poverty line, and we're gonna open our doors to the rest of the world?
the Mexican citizens alone would be enough to bring us to our knees.
it's possible they already have.
and I'm just gonna say this because it needs to be said.
the stuff that goes on in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan...
how easy would it be for somebody in Al Qaeda to come here
now, I'm sorry, I know that's not you people, but our courts have to be mindful of precedents.
we cannot be the safe haven for all the world's victims anymore.
it would be nice if we could. We just can't.
I can't take issue with much of what he said.
something tells me you will, just the same.
well, I do object to little throwaways to the Mexicans, which were designed to push your anti-immigration button, if you got one.
I don't.
the Supreme Court said they couldn't define obscenity, but they know it when they see it.
why the hell they were watching porn isn't clear, but... I would suppose justice is equally hard to define...
but I imagine you'd know it when you see it.
sending these people back to Tanzania, that can't be any judge's version of justice.
I doubt very much it's yours.
it's one thing as a policy maker to say, as did Mr. Flynn, we can't just open our doors and throw down the welcome mat for every persecuted foreign national.
it's quite another for you as a judge to take the affirmative step to send innocent people back to a place where they will be butchered.
you'd never be able to tell your grandchildren that that's what you did today.
and there's a reason for that It would shock their conscience, as it has to shock yours, as it certainly shocks mine.
true, the Tanzanian Government officially condemns the practice, just like the State of Georgia, I suppose, bans fellatio.
but I've been to Georgia, and trust me... - Counselor.
my point is, just because a government is savvy enough to use language of deniability, that doesn't mean these people should be maimed and dismembered.
I've always felt that our country and our courtrooms... have a soul, if you will.
that may sound silly, but...
most legal scholars will say our justice is tempered with compassion and deeply rooted in human rights.
these people... My God!
tell you what... I'll make a deal with you, Judge.
if it feels right to you to send them back... do it.
but if it doesn't... don't.
this is what I don't get.
it's a peeve, a gripe I got as a taxpayer. Know what I'm saying?
I mean, if you can crack it, why can't the police?
this is my taxpayer gripe.
I mean, I know you're all college-educated and whoop-de, whoop-de, whoo.
I didn't crack it. I just asked you to follow a car.
Yeah, but you telling me the police couldn't follow a car?
what's up with that?
uh, afternoon, everybody. How we all doing today?
Cincinnati's finest would like to know.
don't let me stop you from doing your excellent work.
that's a nice blowtorch you got going there, my friend.
I bet you got that at, like, Hammock and Schmuckler.
I just need to have a word with the general manager. Can you tell me where this per...?
well, speak of the devil. How about that?
I checked her employment and I. R. S. records.
she paid no taxes and... - Malcolm, I wouldn't judge her too harshly.
she came from a horrible neighborhood. You said her father's dead.
people do what they do to survive sometimes. In the process, they make bad decisions.
she played me. - She wasn't totally honest.
that doesn't necessarily mean she played you.
okay, she played you.
look, you used to be a drug addict. People change.
may... How long is this going to go on?
Jenna, can you come here and sit for a second?
look, you have to understand...
and I mean this constructively...
you annoy me.
it begs the question, Why do I keep you around?
and the answer is... because I value you enormously.
I mean, look at this place. You did this.
I certainly know that.
when people step in and say Wow, they're talking about your accomplishment, not mine.
and I also realize... I'm a dark person. And left to my own devices, as much as I reject your brightness, your rosy outlook,
I know I perhaps desperately need it.
I'm sorry if I made you feel...
and I can't promise things will be better. I am who I am.
which means, you need to know that I value you.
however I make you feel, you need to know it.
okay. - Okay.
Harry, I like having these little talks.
I'm due back in Cleveland.
my mother used to say Tidy up your house before inviting guests inside.
our house is a mess.
we have 44 million Americans living in poverty.
we are in absolute shambles when it comes to health care, education, housing, employment.
but Ms. Korn's appeal to our nation's soul, so firmly rooted in human rights, is not lost on this court.
to use a tired but applicable sports metaphor, this case is a toss-up.
and in cases of legal toss-ups, the Supreme Court has indicated that it would look to the national consensus.
translation... America's conscience du jour.
Mr. Ngezi, Ms. Sikonge, Ms. Bundala, Mr. Mukasa, the people of the United States do not want you.
our national mood of tolerance, humanity, compassion has been replaced with fear, anxiety, and, yes, selfishness.
the message sent to our nation's leaders is as clear as it is overwhelming.
we need to look after our own.
we are a good people, Americans.
it is my sincere belief that the majority will pray for you.
I assure you I will pray for you. I just can't help you.
adjourned.
I take it she appealed.
she didn't say, but she sounded pretty low.
let her know if she needs me, I'll be at home.
okay.
you okay, buddy? - Fine.
can I talk to you?
first, I provide for a lot of people, including Jamaal.
if I go to prison... - You can save that.
if you think I was using you... - You were.
Malcolm, if there's one thing I can't act, it's when I'm interested in somebody.
I really like you... - You and I got nothing to talk about, Denise.
if I could just exp... - No.
I'll be applying to law school one day. My associations matter.
you and I got nothing to talk about.
okay.
we are not giving up on this. Do you hear me? We're not giving up.
there are still other things we can try.
there's still a lot we can... do.
lot we can do.
okay, we need to go.
thank you, Ms. Korn. Mr. Jefferson.
for everything.
you can thank us by not giving up.
okay, Tommy, now is the time for you to make noise.
done.
this just makes me want to quit. - This is the reason you can never quit.
the biggest misperception about justice is that it's fair.
it's so often not.
the other widely held perception is that it has a conscience.
that one I still cling to. I have to.
plice don't really respond alarms in this neighborhood.
my job is to make it clear that crap don't fly in my neighborhood.
that crap is flying in every neighborhood.
don't you ever do nothing to nobody in that neighborhood again.
especially a somebody I know!
the reason I so went after you in court is because I was daunted by you.
you're Tommy Jefferson.
I promise you, I have a lot of respect for you.
so if two gangs have a ridiculous minor property dispute like this one, they start shooting?
they got this thing here called street advocates.
they try and fix situations like this.
we're like between mediators.
as of right now, they have a new mediator... me.
Boone Park is on that side. Lil'D speak for them.
I want to get out of Boone Park.
I want to go to college, like that Malcolm kid.
what's the big deal? Just say you're out.
in which case, they'll kill me. - come on.
getting someone out of a gang? That is way, way over your head.
they probably would kill him.
it's definitely a possibility.
I cannot believe... - Believe it!
this is way beyond the expertise of a patent lawyer.
you better make this work, 'cause if not, there's gonna be blood.
and it's gonna be on your hands, you understand?
I know getting out of a gang is difficult.
any of you want out, my door is open to help you.
if I hear that anybody tries to get out and ends up dead,
I will hunt the responsible persons down like a mad dog.
Lewis, 'cause of me opening my mouth they must have figured out.
but they also heard you.
they just beat me up, that's all.
you really don't get it, do you?
I probably owe you my life.
told you I got nothing to say.
Mr. Anderson, I assure you, I'm not the police.
I'm a lawyer trying to help one of your neighbors, in fact.
buddy, lawyers don't come around looking to help people in this neighborhood.
Mr. Anderson? You know me. It's what he says.
word is that the accident happened right in front of you.
all we want is for you to tell us what you saw.
well, now's not a good time.
if I come by tomorrow?
we'll see.
man, this is progress here. Trust me.
he's a stubborn old dog.
"we'll see," means probably. You did good.
I really appreciate you coming with me, Lewis.
you know, in high school, I was voted "least likely to be trusted by anybody," so having you with me...
who you with?
who am I with?
I'm talking to him.
I ain't with nobody, bro.
help!
Yes, it's an emergency! I have a gunshot victim.
I'm on the corner of Western and Hill! He's bleeding out! Hurry!
help!
get him on his back. - What the hell? What...
shut up, man. Quick, help him.
I called 911. - Good for you. Now shut up.
all right, shine the light and glove up, all right?
bullet's probably in the liver. I can't get that. Tampons quick.
give him the light. Put pressure right here. Come on, quick.
keep it steady, okay? Stay right on my hands. He needs to get to an E. R.
do you see an E. R.around here?
shut up.
come on, hurry up.
neck.
my God, he's got a bullet in his neck? - Just grazed it. Hang in there.
all right, cut the ends.
come on, man, let's go.
hang on. This ain't right.
he ain't breathing. Big needle, quick!
what are you...
he's still alive. Try not to kill him.
stop! Police!
he's alive?
he made it through surgery, anyway.
he'll be in recovery at least till morning.
my God. What happened?
he was helping me with a witness.
a car pulled up, opened fire on him.
then these kids, they just came out of nowhere.
what kids?
one of them was like a teenage doctor.
his name is Willie Blue. He's 16 years old.
been running an underground MASH unit since he was 14.
how bad is Lewis? - Not good. You know this kid doctor?
some. Local paramedics have known about him and looked the other way, but police just caught him. Seems they ain't looking sideways. He's in custody. Can you help?
Yeah. - Wait. You can't go anywhere.
I told the cops I'd look at mug shots. I got to go down there anyway.
my God.
how'd you learn to do what you did, if I may ask?
I started off with cuts and bruises, right? Then learned how to stitch.
this one guy paid me off with his computer, so learned the rest online and on the streets.
you can learn online how to remove bullets from people?
hands, bro.
it's all in the hands.
what happened to Jamaal?
your buddy? The police didn't catch him. Does he practice medicine, too?
no, he just helps me move bodies and stuff.
how's Lewis?
alive. But not good.
I want to go down there, but the idea of seeing him in recovery strapped to a bunch of wires
I don't know if I can do it.
well, there's probably no point to it, Harry.
he'll just be sedated.
man, get at me soon.
I got nothing so far on which gang we're dealing with, but I will.
I will. Okay, Harry?
this wasn't just Lewis.
Adam was there, too.
now I figure they didn't mean to shoot him. If they did, they would have. But he was there just the same, and I got a job to protect you people which I take serious.
now I know how fond you are of Lewis, so tell me what you want.
I'll try to find out who did it, and if I do you want 'em dead, they be dead.
tell me how you want to play it.
Malcolm, you know of this kid doctor?
heard rumors. A few of the gangs got him on retainer.
he supposedly removes a lot of bullets.
delivers babies now and again.
and they're charging him with...
I assume practicing medicine without a license.
no arraignment's been set.
I got a meeting with the D. A.
I'm hoping to maybe cut it off at the pass.
the fact that he saves lives will help.
the fact that he helps gangs won't.
Adam, how are you doing?
me? I'm fine.
how could you be? You were in the line of gunfire last night.
I'm fine.
somehow, I doubt that. You need to talk to somebody about this.
I was up all night talking to Chunhua.
no, I mean somebody more... - I'm fine.
you.
I want you to find out who shot Lewis.
I do not want you putting yourself in danger in the process.
if you find out, I want you to tell the police.
and that is all. Do I make myself clear, Damien?
good. I'm off to see Lewis.
so you're Harriet Korn.
I am. Very nice to meet you.
though not under these circumstances.
I want to thank you for what you've done for my boy.
well, I'm not sure my coming into Lewis' life has done him a whole lot of good.
she really don't get it, Mom.
your son was helping one of my associates track down a witness when this happened.
it wasn't Boone Park that did this, was it?
no. I don't know who it was.
Hey, Lewis. How we feeling? - Lousy.
Yeah, well, you took quite a few bullets, my friend.
doctor, I'm the boy's mother. Is he going to be okay?
we were able to repair the surrounding organs, but the vascular supply to his liver has been all but destroyed.
we tied off the portal vein and repaired the hepatic artery as best we could.
what is that? - It's the blood vessel going to the liver.
he's seizing. Oxygen.
okay, let's go.
O215 liters.
watch that line.
push one milligram Lorazepam.
pushing one milligram.
standing by.
watch the airway.
call lab stat for ammonia level.
got it.
liver failure?
the thing's blown. If he doesn't get a transplant which he's probably not even a good candidate for in his condition. it's not good, Adam.
we're talking days, at best.
Oh, my God.
for a while.
I'm going to stay here I wrangled a meeting with the hospital transplant board to see if...
I'll let you know. - Okay.
I'm still waiting to meet with the D. A.I'll check in after that.
Adam? Kim Mendelsohn.
thanks for meeting with me.
sure. Come on in.
the first question is, are you really going to prosecute this kid?
okay, then mine would be why wouldn't I?
he's a dangerous felon. - Dangerous felon?
look, I'm sure Snoop Doogie's a genius, but he's also a serious threat to people's safety.
he just saved a life. - Yeah, even so, you can't...
Really?
sorry. I just had this first date with a guy.
never expected him to call me back.
this boy is providing medical care.
care which the people in this community don't get.
do I really need to tell you about the lack of basic human services in the ghettos these days?
you know what, I really wish you wouldn't.
look, hon, I've heard about your motor mouth, and with me, it's really a nonstarter.
I've got two ex-husbands, three kids and a mother who's still alive, so I'm kind of immune to the big,"Rah-rah-rah," you know what.
kim can I call you Kim? - Go for it.
I happen to know you're a compassionate woman.
I also happen to know that your office is trying to cultivate a more friendly public image.
I'm sure your superiors would look favorably...
okay, you know what?
I'm a little deaf to the charm.
and as for the "let's look good for my bosses" angle, they're all narcissistic boozers, so how about we take a breath, we'll have a Tic-Tac, and we'll just start again?
we'll plead no contest to unauthorized practice of medicine, you agree to charge him as a juvenile, drop all the other charges and recommend a stayed sentence.
that's better!
but I'm gonna charge him as an adult with unauthorized practice, conspiracy, complicity with criminal enterprises, accessory after the fact, obstructing justice and interfering with a police investigation.
that sound good? - Come on!
I'm sensing that it doesn't.
okay, how about if he pleads to it all, we'll take off some of the time?
but really only because I'm insecure and I want you to like me.
he's a good kid. He's not in a gang or...
Adam, he is in all of them!
the hospitals by law have to report gunshot wounds, stabbings and the like.
that's why the bangers go to him!
your hero aids and abets, he obstructs justice not to mention the threat to human life.
most of his patients are innocent, law-abiding people who...
one, would also need a license to treat.
when he gets profiled 60 Minutes, you're gonna look like a big ghoul.
I am a big ghoul.
I did three years in ghoul school.
we're prosecuting.
so what you're telling me is that you can't do nothing?
I didn't say that.
look, she is letting you out pending arraignment.
conditioned on you not practicing any more medicine.
you got parents? I should talk to them.
what's up with Lewis?
he needs a new liver.
is he gonna die?
we don't know.
my understanding is that in a case of life and death, a patient would be bumped to the top of the list.
that's true.
but it would be conditioned on the patient's ability to withstand the procedure and...
the boy just took six bullets and lived.
that should tell you he's a survivor.
it's because he took the six bullets that we...
this kid is going to die.
that makes him Status One.
counsel, as I'm sure you can appreciate, there are precious few livers to give out.
and we need to make 'em count.
Lewis Epps is not likely to survive the procedure.
that isn't true.
you seriously mean to impose your medical judgment here?
you're right. That was wrong. I'm just a lawyer.
I should only offer a legal perspective.
here it is: if that boy, Status One, doesn't get a transplant, and dies, his family will have a wrongful death claim against this hospital which I will bring with all my girth.
are you threatening us?
that's exactly what I'm doing.
you want to roll the dice here, fine. Let's play.
what about the mother?
she was tested; not a compatible donor, according to the doctors.
I'm off to see Willie. I'll be back in an hour.
this would be what is known as an act of God.
Harry told me about your case.
the prosecuting attorney is Kim Mendelsohn?
okay, anybody here know what that meant?
I don't want to know what that meant.
kim Mendelsohn and I used to be a thing.
she loved me then, she loves me now.
I'm the one who got away. She is putty to me.
you and Kim Mendelsohn were once together?
consider this in the bag; putty.
Thanks, but, uh... - But what?
putty, I tell you. Bring me up to speed. I'll have your boy out by end of business.
walk with me.
Harry, I think we should move.
what do you mean, move?
I don't like what this neighborhood is doing to us.
what is it doing?
it's dragging us into this big hole.
Adam got shot at, Chunhua almost got raped, Damien almost killed somebody, Lewis almost got killed.
and it's not a fluke, Harry. It's life in this neighborhood.
and yeah, we can take it for a while, we have, but everything, it's going to get us.
and it's going to win.
it's going to win.
you're too old to be getting into fights, dawg.
it's one thing if you win one now and again.
you're gonna feel a little pull here, okay?
all right,
that kinda hurt, man!
all right, man, you're done.
plan to fight? Please get hit in the other eye.
Shirley, could you bring Armand up here, please?
Willie, you got bail conditioned on you not practicing.
Yeah, yeah.
all right, take a deep breath for me, baby, okay?
he's been coughing for two days and he's hot.
got a little cough, my man?
all right, let's check the ear.
okay, the cough is just from a cold.
but he has an ear infection and that's where the fever's coming from.
all right? So I'm gonna give you this.
I'm gonna give you this antibiotic.
I want him to take half a teaspoon three times a day, okay?
don't forget. And bring him back in a couple of days.
Thanks, honey.
Where'd you get the antibiotics?
man, why do you got to know that?
Willie, Cole got stabbed a little.
all right, lay him down there.
he won't let me pull the knife.
he screams every time I touch it.
hold him down.
you two could help, you know?
this is a $4, 000 suit. That's a leg.
it's okay.
he gonna die Lewis?
he might.
we want to donate, you understand?
with liver transplants, there's no need to take the whole thing.
only just a small part, so one of us has to be a match.
you're all here offering to be liver donors?
just tell us what we got to do.
you're the ones who beat Lewis within an inch of his life.
we like the kid, lady.
that's why we didn't kill him.
Oh, dear God, just the image of you.
Tommy, how are you?
right now, looking at you? Loaded question.
my mind quickly jumps back to Napa, 1994.
you, me, in the shower, remember?
every time I think of you and me together, it makes me want to shower.
I'm working on the Willie Blue case.
he's a good kid. Kim, like a son to me.
saves lives.
I know I can find it in that heart of yours to let him go.
if not that heart, then...
if you're here thinking that you can trade on what truly was the lowest moment of my life, forget it.
ballistics just came back.
what ballistics?
there were a bunch of bullets in Dr. Willie's little backpack.
bullets that he had taken out of various patients, it seems.
And?
and one of those bullets was from a police officer's gun.
a police officer who was killed in a shootout a couple of weeks ago after he fired on the gunman and hit him in the shoulder.
which means Willie is complicit with a cop killer.
that's a game-changer.
look... - Don't even try.
I don't care how many people your little angel has saved.
none of it makes up for a dead cop.
cop killer? - That's the bad news.
the good news is we have an opportunity.
which is?
she'll let Willie go completely if he forks over the shooter.
Really?
we need to talk to the kid, then go back to the D. A.
the only other play I see is try this in the media, which I'm happy to do.
That's...Okay, let's go see Willie.
you really think we should move?
I don't know. How many more shootings or muggings?
I don't know how much longer I can do it.
do what?
are you serious?
you say you don't know how long you can do it. I'm not sure what you mean.
you know what, Malcolm? I have the toughest job of everyone here.
you know why?
because it falls on me every day to come in here and be upbeat.
Harry has the personality of a troll, you see Adam get sucked into a funk, you have a permanently furrowed brow, but Jenna, she keeps everything upbeat, doesn't she?
it's attitude, Malcolm. It's, it's, positive outlook.
I just don't know if I can do it, okay?
look, I treat lots of people, okay?
I never ask how they get their wounds or...
this one would have been an upper right shoulder wound two weeks ago Tuesday night.
you just need to tell him who he was.
I don't know who it was.
look, kid, you want your freedom or not?
ever hear of doctor-patient privilege?
I have. It applies to real doctors, which you're not.
people won't come in here for help if they think I'm gonna rat.
Willie, you have a chance at avoiding jail.
and do you really want to protect some guy who killed a cop?
you're not hearing me.
my patients won't come in if they think I'm gonna call the authorities.
I get a lot of illegals, and if they... - Earth to Willie? Dead cop.
the police are gonna do everything to get that shooter.
if that means torturing you, they'll happily do it.
the only real question here is do you derive any benefit from having that information or not?
I don't know the guy's name, okay?!
it would be considered a directed organ donation to someone with a special relationship with Lewis.
you have no reason not to honor it.
first of all, I think I speak for everyone in this room when I say
I am touched by the generosity of heart demonstrated by your band of criminals.
our answer, however, is no.
what? Why?
even though this is arguably legitimate, the decision still ultimately rests with the board's discretion, and...
and what? - These are violent criminals.
we're hardly convinced they're here on purely altruistic reasons. There's likely some quid pro quo.
such as what? You don't have any evidence.
it's enough if we suspect it.
ms. Korn, these people lie, cheat, steal, and murder for a living.
forgive us for not trusting their assurances.
Mr. Barron...
there are hundreds of thousands of people waiting for organs.
we are desperate for people to donate.
they won't, if the integrity of the system is called into question.
there's a kid lying in one of your hospital beds who will die...
our hospital is half-filled with dying patients.
a testament to the quality of your care, I'm sure, but - I don't think insulting us is. - All right.
first you state the survivability of the patient, now you say you don't like the people who want to donate.
why are we even here?
shouldn't you be off somewhere suing us by now, with all your girth?
that was uncalled for, Frank.
ms. Korn, we appreciate the potentially tragic stakes involved here.
we really do. We deal with this every single day.
sometimes it seems we're in the business of looking family members in the eye and saying, "Sorry. We won't save your loved one." It isn't a fun experience.
so when we say "integrity of the system," it isn't just blather.
we're seeing an increase in illegal transplants, black market organ buyers.
there is basically a world-wide flea market for kidneys on the Internet.
we just had an arrest in New York of an organ broker.
but that's not this case. - No, it isn't.
but you know as well as I do this would be front-page news.
we certainly don't want this hospital singled out as the one who saved a gang member by...
Lewis Epps is not a gang member.
he was. He was in Boone Park.
the very gang that's stepping forward.
we do not trust the legitimacy of this procurement.
we do respect your point of view.
we ask you to respect ours.
so it's over?
it's not over.
I'm Leland Parks. We haven't officially met. I'm Chief of Staff here.
I won't bother with the primer on hospital politics, there isn't time.
go get yourself a court order; I'll make this happen.
do you know of a court that would give me that order?
no. But you strike me as an uncommonly resilient woman.
hurry, Ms. Korn. The boy's going south.
why me ? all the judges, you pick me?
the one who tried to get you disbarred?
well, you strike me as a normally reasonable person.
and a compassionate one.
and you figure I might owe you one.
okay.
they admitted he was Status One, so...
even if I were to give you this ex parte, they would be back here so fast, demanding a full hearing.
no. The Chief of Staff assured me that wouldn't happen.
and what allows me to substitute my judgment for that of a medical board?
this isn't a medical decision, really. It's an administrative one.
you will have to do better than that.
okay, can you even give me a legal nail to hang my robe on?
when I go rogue, I like to at least make it look good.
well, they're saying they question the legitimacy of the procurement.
do they not have a burden to at least substantiate their doubt?
my suspicion is that the burden falls on you to show that they're guilty of bad faith.
can we pretend I satisfied that burden?
this kid was born into a gang.
he risked his life to get out.
got beaten half to death for doing so, and now, while helping us on another case, he gets shot.
he's got to be due for a break, somewhere, from somebody.
and you think it's here. From me.
well, I could be wrong, but sometimes a judge gets to make a ruling not because it's necessarily supported by the law, but because it feels in her gut like the right thing to do.
just do this, Judge.
it's not like it'll kill anybody if you give me this order.
whereas if you don't?
and yes, you do owe me one.
he doesn't know the guy's name? You expect me to believe that?
he doesn't ask questions. He just treats wounds.
he doesn't know the guy's name?
come on, Kim. Nobody...
when you and I first slept together, we didn't know each other's names.
get him down to the police station, and have him start looking through mug books.
there is no deal unless he makes the shooter.
could... hang back here a second, could you, please?
I didn't appreciate that remark. - I was just saying...
I know what you were saying, and I don't like it.
my apologies.
Tommy, I am embarrassed that you and I were once a couple.
Why? - Because...
you were that guy, seen on television, with your ridiculous...
look, it doesn't exactly help my career to be associated with you, plus...
we laughed together.
we traveled, we...enjoyed each other, Kim.
why would you be embarrassed about that?
most people would give anything to be able to enjoy life.
I don't want you making comments. Okay?
okay.
that took you exactly 25 minutes.
in a prior life, I was Wonder Woman.
well, we found three good matches among your collection of Good Samaritans.
with one that is exceptional.
it's you.
all right, then.
so my brow is furrowed, is it? Permanent?
I'm sorry. I didn't really mean. - It's okay.
I went to the doctor's, try to get it fixed, he said, nothing he could do.
best thing is a procedure to make my ears stick out so people notice that instead.
thought it worked, till now. You still noticed.
you think that you're really funny, don't you?
like, really, really funny.
nice try, though.
okay, good news is, I seen him in this book.
all right, which one?
bad news is, I ain't telling you until we improve my deal.
what? - Willie?
look, I want immunity if I ever get caught practicing medicine again.
I mean, which I won't. - All right.
before you start lecturing me, big lady, a lot of my patients are undocumented. Okay?
if they don't get me, they get no medical treatment at all.
I mean, and even those who got coverage can't afford to miss a whole day's work, which they would if they had to go to the ER.
so you need to think of them people, big lady.
thank you. I will. But for now?
pick out the guy who shot the cop, or I will have your bail revoked, and you will be sleeping in a jail cell tonight, you little turd.
Willie, you gotta do this. That's the deal.
look, I don't want to run here, bro.
no, you don't. Pick out the shooter.
there. That's the guy.
positive? - Positive. Look, I remember.
that dude looked scary.
I was a little afraid of him. He was a big dude.
it was like he wasn't even grateful, you know?
Yeah, that's-that's him.
Willie, are you sure? - I told you, I'm positive.
that's the guy.
Harry, it's only a matter of time before the police find out where he is.
Adam, you've got to...
he's the donor.
he's in pre-op now. They've scheduled the surgery for...
if the police show up here, the board will stop the procedure.
there's no way they'll...
Oh, my God.
you gotta go back to this D. A.Just buy a few hours.
we're talking about a cop killer.
I very much doubt the police will hold off, here.
all right. I'll meet you at the D. A.'s office. I'm on my way.
you don't seriously think I'm going to delay his arrest so he gets the chance to play hero?
this isn't about him.
it's about Lewis Epps, who will die...
this man shot and killed a police officer.
and he's effectively in custody now.
he's not going anywhere.
there's no guarantee of that.
if he gets wind that we're looking for him, he could...
what I'm asking's that you don't go looking for him.
at least not until the procedure is underway.
don't go looking for him?
the thing is, if the police even show up at the hospital, it'll kill the transplant.
I know it. I barely pushed this thing through as it is.
ms. Korn, even if I had the authority to delay his arrest...
the police will follow your lead.
the answer is no.
Kim... I know you don't like it out there that you and I were once...
but...but we were.
and one reason we were, at least in my mind, I loved you.
quite a lot, actually.
Tommy, that is not really relevant to this...
Yes, it is.
I loved you for a lot of reasons, but one was, you had a humanity that I could only aspire to.
and I admired that you were a tough D. A.
but you were kind, where you could be.
and you can be here, Kim.
you can catch your bad guy, and allow Lewis Epps to live.
this boy hasn't caught many breaks in his life.
if he doesn't catch one now...he's dead.
the procedure is set to start when?
about an hour.
at which point we move in.
thank you.
thank you.
Hey, Mom.
don't you die on me, you hear?
you hear me?
don't worry.
Harry will kick my ass if I do.
don't forget it. - See you soon.
I love you.
I love you, baby.
can I talk to him, please?
I don't even know what to say to you.
I will never forget what you are doing here.
thank you.
how's it going?
they've been in about two hours.
they say it'll take at least another five or six.
look, if I can have everybody's attention.
one of the reasons I never had children was because well, I loathe children.
they're as overrated as chicken soup.
but I'm going to play mother now.
first you.
you witnessed a near murder. You were almost killed yourself.
if you do not get therapy, I will personally drag your ass into the doctor's office, you got that?
we're going to have days where we...
the things that have gone on, how could we not be running for the exits?
but this neighborhood, despite all its faults, it's in my blood now.
is there danger here? Okay. Pain? Absolutely.
but it's in me, this neighborhood.
the battles we wage, like the one we're waging today, they matter.
I just think that you speak with the perspective of a 60-year-old, and maybe some of us want to live to be 60, too. That's all.
anyone else want out?
I don't think anybody wants out.
I just think as we go about our business fighting for everybody else, we got to take care of each other, too.
maybe we're not doing enough of that.
you can park over there in visitor parking.
I'll stay with Malcolm.
anything new? - Just waiting.
Tommy, this wouldn't be happening right now if you hadn't come through in a very big way.
I know. I'm really good.
Yeah, you are.
Thanks.
chief of staff's been looking for you.
he's not happy about all the police.
that was really nice what you said about how we all needed to look after each other.
Yeah. You know what you need to do?
not be afraid to have a bad mood.
I mean, it's good your positive attitude and all, but you won't survive if you hold stuff in.
maybe. - No maybe.
I'm right, and you know I am.
have your little tantrums. We can take it.
will do.
thank you.
I didn't see that coming. - Me neither. I'm sorry.
no, no, I'm sorry. You shouldn't even say you're sorry. I started it.
you don't have to say sorry.
you like Elvis Presley?
I'm sorry? - Elvis, you a fan?
well, I suppose. Why?
this whole thing reminds me of that song of his,"In the Ghetto."
it's a fabulous song. I love that song.
as the crowd gathers round an angry young man
facedown in the street with a gun in his hand
in the ghetto...
perhaps some other time.
and his mama cried...
sorry - Mrs. Epps? - Yes.
one amazingly tough kid you got there.
thank God.
Really?
not out of the woods.
with transplants, there is the risk of rejection, infection, a lot of potholes.
but it went very well. Lewis is doing well.
we're guardedly optimistic.
thank you. Thank you.
and I understand you're the one who got him to us.
I did.
Yeah, well, you've got a good pair of hands, young man.
you get your training, you'll be some kind of doctor.
I'll get that training, too.
all I need is $200, 000.
when can we see Lewis?
Oh, he'll be out for another five or six hours.
the donor's awake now.
he live?
he lived. It all went well. That's the good news.
there's bad news, I'm afraid.
Li'I D, don't say anything.
what's going on?
don't say anything at all.
isaac Roberts, you are under arrest for the murder of Officer Xavier Elroy.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to speak with an attorney.
if you can't afford...
you agreed to represent him?
I couldn't hang him out. Not after...
you represent a cop killer, Harry, you can forget about having a good relationship with the police.
I'm not saying I'll defend him in court, Tommy.
I just couldn't hang him out to dry tonight.
voluntary manslaughter, three years.
that is a gift, you know it.
here's our problem. Our client is convinced she didn't do this.
I will never get her to admit to an intentional homicide.
well, then I suggest you get her to a doctor, Harry.
we've already gotten her to seven.
and they pretty much say the same thing:
she likely blocked it out.
I think I can sell her on negligent homicide.
I'll still give you the three years, Ben. Why do you care?
I care because negligent homicide is a mockery.
she just so happens to accidentally kill her baby who just so happens to be suffering from anencephaly?
look, you want her off the street, I get that.
but come on. She belongs in a hospital, not a prison.
you know, I really don't believe that.
she murdered a child. We've got a sympathetic client here.
we could easily get up there and argue the virtues of physician-assisted suicide.
what are you doing?
I'm offering you guys three years for an intentional homicide. Why are you not jumping at this?
because even if we were inclined to jump, the client won't.
and you told her she could get 25-to-life?
we ran that by her, yeah.
she needs treatment, Ben.
I'm not in the treatment business.
just prison.
so what now?
well, we may be forced to withdraw as counsel.
the day before the trial?
well, she's gonna have to testify.
we can't willingly put her on the stand to lie.
she wouldn't be lying if she thinks she didn't do it. It's crooked.
your other alternative is to challenge her competency.
it won't fly, she's already passed every competency test.
well, then you need to read her the riot act now.
we already did.
Oh, hello. We can go right in my office.
maybe you should tell them, Cassie.
but I barely know them. - Shh.
you moved the ladder.
no, I didn't. Well, you shook it then.
okay, look, If we try to argue to the jury you didn't cause your baby's death, we will lose.
it's that simple. I don't know how else to put it.
but it's the truth.
you remember Cassie Reynolds?
I asked her to cast a fresh eye on this.
she has something she'd like to say.
tell them what you'd like to say.
when the nurse passed your son to you, he was alive.
and when she took him from you...
he was not.
the child died in your hands.
there is no dispute.
and the cause of death was a broken neck.
what are you saying?
she's saying your wife is going to prison, Blake.
the baby was only three days old.
the neck is so fragile. It could've...
there's no medical evidence to support that it could've just broken.
there could've been a fracture that we didn't know about.
or some... some genetic defect.
we haven't been able to find a doctor who will support that either.
look, if you acted somehow to relieve the child's suffering...
she didn't do that.
my wife would never willingly cause the death of our child.
a human life is sacred, Mr. Richard.
every life, no matter what, it is sacred.
I can maybe sell a jury a mercy killing.
but if we go in there claiming you didn't do this...
she didn't. - I'm talking to your wife right now.
the prosecutor cannot prove she did this because she didn't.
she didn't.
I didn't.
he's totally controlling her.
maybe she knows she did it, she's just afraid to admit it to her husband.
have you been able to talk to this woman alone?
once, but I think I'm gonna have to try again.
Tommy, if I could ask...
What?! I was just helping him... balance.
are you okay?
no.
Tommy, I don't know what's gonna happen, but it's possible that the husband and wife are gonna need to get separate counsel.
are you available? - I am.
thank you. And, Adam, would you do some research on active euthanasia, where the law currently stands in Ohio?
I can tell you now it's illegal.
Yeah, just do the research all the same, will you?
Ollie? - Yeah?
I may need you to get in the husband's face a little.
done. What else? - Could just fix the star on top of the tree?
Hello, hello, hello!
is somebody having a birthday?!
she is!
happy birthday, Harry. Happy birthday, Harry!
you got me a clown?
that new bakery on Fourth is having a promotion; free clown with the purchase of a birthday cake. I couldn't resist.
you got me a discount clown.
now, before we get to that scrumpdiliumptious cake...
Oh, look what I did there.
let me just pick that up.
well, thank you, little lady!
now who wants to see a magic trick?
you could saw me in half.
??? Look what we have here. A heart!
isn't she pretty? Now the thing about hearts though, is sometimes they get broken.
Yes, a heart can get broken, and it gets torn.
but if a good little birthday girl will just blow on the pieces, maybe they'll go back together!
now who's a good girl, huh? Who's a good girl?!
who's a dead clown?
Okey，okey, I'll do it myself.
let's see here.
and we put the heart back together!
good as new.
okay, wrap it up, clown.
look what we have here. A heart!
now the thing about hearts is...
I already did that, didn't I?
a heart... uh...
something's up with the clown.
are you okay?
not really, no.
over here, Ms. Korn. Get back, get back, get back.
we're a little bit early.
why don't we wait in the witness room until we're called.
Blake, can I talk to you for a sec?
listen, I know you love your wife, but if you're covering for her...
I'm not.
when you left to go home, you know for a fact the baby was still alive?
Absolutely. I kissed him good night.
Absolutely.
all right, Julie, I'm gonna cut to the chase.
we don't have time for any more crap, you get me?
what do you mean?
some of our shrinks think you blocked this whole thing out, others thought maybe not so much.
you know what I'm thinking?
you did this and you know you did it, but you're afraid to say so in front of your husband.
that's not true.
shouldn't we go inside? - Oh, no, we're fine.
I just want to go over some body language things.
a few dos and don'ts in the courtroom.
Yeah. I'd like to go in there, please.
we've got a shot here, but only if you come clean.
if you lie, you go to prison.
why can't we go inside?
because I need your full attention here.
this is important.
not so fast. Not so fast!
what's, what's going on here?
what's going on is Harry needs to talk to her client in private.
what the hell's going on?
what's going on is I think it's possible your wife is afraid to tell the truth, and what's got her afraid is you.
what? Tell her that's not true.
honey...
is this true?
no.
okay, look, honey...
God forgives.
and if you did this, to spare our baby suffering,
God will certainly forgive that.
I'll forgive that.
is that what happened?
honey, it's okay.
is that what happened?
I promise I was just holding him.
I didn't do anything.
I was just holding him.
I could never...
let's just try it on the elements.
this is by no means a slam dunk, but a baby's neck is fragile, he was three days old.
let's just go with accident.
accident? We haven't got one single witness.
Yes, we do. Her.
she was the only one there.
all we need is reasonable doubt.
we keep her out of jail, then we get her into treatment.
an accident.
Dr. Robbins and I examined the baby just prior to passing him to Mrs. Cassidy.
his organs were functioning, his vitals were within range.
he was a tough little customer, given his deficit.
so what happened after you gave the child to the defendant?
I drew the baby's blood.
Dr. Robbins continued on his rounds.
I took the sample down to the lab, and I returned about ten minutes later.
what did you find?
well, Julie, um, the defendant, she was holding the baby.
I noticed he looked slightly cyanotic.
that's when the skin takes on a bluish tint due to lack of oxygen.
what did you do?
I took him from Julie.
he was clammy, his limbs were flaccid.
I called a Code Blue, but I knew he'd expired.
and other than the defendant, had anyone else gone into the baby's room after you and Dr. Robbins had left?
not to my knowledge.
Mr. Cassidy was in the room earlier, but the baby was alive after he'd gone home.
thank you, ma'am.
what was the medical condition of this baby?
he was born with anencephaly.
which means what?
he had no cognitive or emotional functions.
he's blind, deaf, couldn't swallow, blink or cry.
his only movements were involuntary reflexes.
Yes.
I'm told of cases where doctors with anencephalic babies, doctors have been known to pinch the nostrils shut.
have you heard of that?
I have heard of that happening.
mercy killings. Yes.
did you think it's possible that my client committed a mercy killing here?
I don't know.
I don't get the idea that you condemn her.
in your mind, was it a tragedy that this baby died?
probably not.
what the hell was that? Relax.
we were going accident, not mercy killing.
I realize that, but... - Then what the hell was that?
Ollie, would you please stop yelling at me?
we have plenty of time to establish our theory.
I feel it's important that the jury understand from the get-go that this death was a blessing.
if we can diffuse their sense of horror, then it could color the whole trial in our client's favor.
but, Harry, you likely just confused the jury.
couldn't you have at least just asked her if it could've been an accident?
no, I couldn't, because I don't think we'd have liked her answer.
my goal here was to get the jury to think that this death wasn't necessarily a bad thing.
what's that?
bear spray.
you expecting a bear?
it's like industrial-strength pepper spray, okay?
in case we get attacked by a gang.
Mr. Clown, Tommy Jefferson... we met last night at the party.
Oh. You want your money back? - No, no.
it isn't that. We just came because...
why does he have, bear spray?
it's for gangs.
we couldn't help but think something was wrong last night, and we just came to see if you're okay.
you've upset him. - I can see that.
no, no, it's, uh...
it's just, uh...
just what?
we were in Kandahar province.
six of us were on patrol.
an IED went off.
my head slammed against the side of the Humvee.
two guys were killed, one guy lost a leg, and the other two had shrapnel wounds.
seemed like I was the lucky one.
they even started calling me Lucky.
but, uh, for days afterwards, I started getting these headaches.
I'd get dizzy.
I had trouble walking.
did you see a doctor?
Yeah. They said I had a concussion, a mild traumatic brain injury.
see, I used to work toward my ETA cert with, uh, precision instruments...
uh, gyrocompasses, things like this.
I was really good.
but now...
now you're a clown.
I can't concentrate on things.
I get the headaches or, uh... or my thinking gets clouded.
have you had any medical treatment?
Yeah, they gave me some meds for the headaches.
they help a little, I guess.
see, last night was about, uh...
when I was looking at that heart...
see, I never got the Purple Heart.
but you were injured in combat.
Yeah, but when I got hurt...
eight months ago... something like that...
they had this policy called the "no more John Kerrys.
the hell is that? - "No more John Kerrys.
some people claimed John Kerry's wounds were not serious enough to deserve the Purple Heart.
the Army stopped giving them out for what they called minor injuries.
Yeah. Thing is, I served with guys that lost arms and legs, had to have surgery to remove shrapnel and bullets.
I guess I just figured, compared to them, I didn't deserve it.
but then I looked it up in the regs... the... the list of injuries that you can get the Purple Heart for...
it turns out I should have gotten it.
concussion injuries caused as a result of enemy-generated explosions.
did you apply for it... the Purple Heart?
Yeah. I was turned down.
I know it shouldn't mean anything.
it's not like a lousy medal's going to pay the rent.
it shouldn't matter.
but it does.
my father...
he would always say, "Make your life count for something.
he'd say, "I don't care what you do, Dave.
you know, just make sure it adds up to...something.
I'm a clown.
I can't hold a job.
I can't think well.
I got hurt in a war that nobody wanted or seems to care about.
Yes, I want that medal.
I want to hold it in my hand, you know, and I want to look at it and feel proud and know that my country is proud of me.
and know that...
that what I did...
it counted.
the infant's head was twisted sharply and suddenly to the left, causing the vertebral artery to burst, resulting in a massive hemorrhage at the base of the brain.
death was instantaneous.
could it be possible that the neck was twisted accidentally?
no. - It's not possible that somebody picked up the baby and didn't support his head, or his neck got caught in a blanket?
no, this was no accident.
thank you.
doctor, you can state to an absolute medical certainty that this event wasn't caused by an inadvertent movement?
well, no one can state anything to an absolute medical certainty, - but the... - Thank you, Doctor.
and, uh, in fact, if Mrs. Cassidy was dozing...
I mean, people experience jerking motions in their sleep all the time, don't they?
I don't think that's what happened.
you know that didn't happen?
no, but I have performed over a thousand autopsies, - and what I think really happened... - Wow.
that's a lot. Ever get one wrong?
beg your pardon? - Have you ever been mistaken?
Yes, but... Thank you, Doctor.
and if I put six different pathologists up here, who all say that this death could have been caused by an accidental jarring of the neck, would you say they're lying?
I'd say they were wrong.
would you say they were lying?
no. - I wouldn't say they were...
thank you, Doctor.
that's all.
Mr. Fraser, redirect?
no, Your Honor.
the witness may step down.
the State calls any one of these six pathologists.
ms. Korn's choice.
excuse me? - One of your six pathologists... whichever one you want.
I'm calling one.
or am I just calling a bluff?
your Honor, may we approach?
he can't do that. - Why not?
first of all, these pathologists are not on your list or mine.
you can't... - What, what, you need notice?
they're your doctors.
I move for a mistrial.
Oh, come on. - He cannot do this.
ms. Korn, you played a little fast and loose.
he caught you.
motion for a mistrial is denied.
step back.
Oh, shut up.
we're going to have to put you on the stand.
okay.
no, not okay, because you come off as a person in total denial.
here are our theories, Julie.
it could have been an accident.
it could have been an act committed in a dissociative state. - No.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Julie, stop it.
I know who you are as a person couldn't have done this, which means, if you physically did do it, you were acting outside yourself, and that's what a dissociative state is.
we have to allow the jury to conclude you did it, and yet set you free because you didn't possess the intent.
you mean insanity.
it's a form of it.
it's a psychotic break of sorts.
it's a variation of insanity.
but it's not the truth, because I didn't do it.
okay.
but you have to let me argue it just the same.
we suggest... could be an accident, could be a dissociative act.
we have to give the jury both options here.
you have to trust me.
so what do I say?
you just tell the truth.
that's all you do.
tell the truth as you know it.
we need to get him his Purple Heart.
I know some of these vets, they have no money, no dignity, they can't get work, they've got nothing.
now, this thing may seem, like, just symbolic to you and me, but to them, it's a validation that what they did counted, that their life means something.
we need to get Dave his Purple Heart right now.
today.
Tommy, I've done some checking.
this is not easily accomplished.
these things can fall into bureaucratic sinkholes for years.
and I'm going to bring up a principle now, one that I know you hold dear, if not sacrosanct...
Dave the Clown can't pay.
I don't care. It's Christmas!
it's that special time of year when we don't despise our fellow man.
uh... - We'll do it pro bono.
we need to get the clown his Purple Heart.
I never had an ultrasound done because, frankly, there was nothing either I or my husband would have done should there be a problem.
and there was a problem, wasn't there?
Yes.
when did you learn that your baby had anencephaly?
un, when he was born.
I noticed some looks exchanged between the doctor and the nurses.
it was so quiet. I...
the baby was quiet.
he, uh...
he didn't make a sound.
I first thought he was dead.
he wasn't dead.
but he was very, very ill.
would it be fair to say you went into a little shock when you learned?
Yes.
turning to the night of his death...
were you holding your baby?
the truth is, it was... it was difficult for me to hold him or...
it was just too upsetting.
but Eileen, the nurse, she encouraged me to.
she said that it would help lower his stress hormones, and help regulate his temperature.
so you were cradling him? - Yes.
were you supporting his head?
I thought so. I...
it was the middle of the night.
I might have drifted off to sleep a little, but I most certainly did not twist his head.
according to certain witnesses, when your baby was discovered to be dead, you didn't react.
you just stared back rather expressionless.
I didn't know what to think, or feel.
you didn't know how to feel?
Julie, your child had just died.
my child was anencephalic.
the doctor said he would have the existence of a house plant.
the only life that he could have had would have been one of suffering.
did you grieve for your son?
I grieved for my son.
did I grieve over his death?
I've never denied that his death was most likely a blessing, only that I had anything to do with it.
he needs to fill out... - No, no, no, no, no, I told you, he filled that out already.
form 149?
Yes, Department of Defense Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record.
??? I'm holding a copy in my hand right now.
name please? - David Kerwin.
Kerwin with one "N.
please hold. - No, don't put me on hold again!
damn it!
this is how the terrorists are going to win.
they'll land on our shores, somebody will call the army to report it.
they'll be put on hold and we'll all be killed.
the appeal process seems easy enough, except it involved miles of red tape.
here's something.
if you've been awarded the Purple Heart, you get expedited treatment at the V. A. hospital.
which is another reason to get it.
and here's a story about a guy in California who just received his Purple Heart a few months ago.
he'd been hit by a grenade, tore open his arm.
september, 1951 in Korea.
let's talk to your captain, Maybe he'd reconsider and recommend you.
that would be difficult.
dead? No, no, but he's in Afghanistan.
has he got a wife?
Ugh, you're sick.
what? You're sick.
I'm sick? You're sick.
has he got a wife?
first of all, my condolences for your tragedy.
that tragedy, if I understand you correctly, being his birth, not his death.
my sympathies.
sir, you are prosecuting me.
I'm sitting in a courtroom, being charged with murder, primarily at your doing.
please, have the decency not to pretend that you feel any sympathy for me.
fair enough.
let's agree to be honest with each other. Sound good?
when we speak of tragedy here, we're not just talking about the child's, but yours.
and perhaps your greatest hardship would have been had this little boy gone on living.
your insurance covered the hospital, but there was a cap on nursing care.
this child would need 24/7 home care.
you couldn't afford it, which meant that it would've had to be you.
you'd have to monitor his vitals, change his feeding tube, suction his mouth every 30 minutes because he couldn't swallow his own spit.
your life as you knew it would effectively be over.
you'd go bankrupt.
statistically speaking, you'd probably get divorced.
not to mention the emotional toll.
so much hardship which could all be fixed with one quick twist of a neck.
you know the funny thing?
how clinically efficient this broken neck was.
I mean, the baby died instantly.
now, I know as a devout Catholic, that you don't believe in euthanasia.
but if one did, wow, a snap of a neck was probably the most humane method.
by the way, uh, do you believe in euthanasia?
I don't mean to assume.
do you? - Uh, no.
no.
did you ever inquire about euthanasia?
I d... didn't inquire about euthanasia, no.
you never asked Dr. Robbins whether it would be better for your child to die?
I was in shock when I asked that.
I was looking at my child as...
as a house plant?
you asked Dr. Robbins, "How is it we help cancer patients die with morphine?
why can't we just give him some morphine?
your Honor, approach?
first of all, this is privileged doctor/patient...
it is not; not when it speaks to harm caused to the child,
second, this is unfair surprise. If he had... and the nurse was there, so privilege...
the information was within the defendant's control.
Oh, crap! Your Honor, this is crap.
well, as far as crap goes, it seems to be of the winning variety.
your Honor, this will so prejudice the jury...
step back, Counsel.
okay, so where were we?
Oh, yes. We were discussing your discussing killing your baby.
Objection!
that I'll sustain.
you spoke with your doctor about giving your baby a morphine drip.
I was emotionally wrought.
I was a mother looking at suffering, the suffering of my baby, and I... I wanted...
Yeah.
Yes.
and I really don't believe that this was about bankruptcy or finances or money.
I don't.
this was about mercy. Wasn't it, Julie?
your baby suffered from anencephaly.
he would never live a normal life, if any life.
it was ungodly for any child to exist like this.
and when you twisted his neck, it was about mercy.
wasn't it?
I did not twist my baby's neck.
don't everybody shout out ideas all at once.
I think we should recall the nurse, so we can at least put whatever comments Julie made to the doctor in context.
or call the doctor himself.
the doctor is the one who turned her into the police; we can't trust that he'll be sympathetic.
but the nurse, we can.
maybe it's time to plead this thing out.
with a plea, you could be out in three years.
if we go to verdict and you lose, you could face 20.
honey, maybe...
but here's the rub.
the judge cannot legally accept the plea without being sure you understand it, and that you're sincere about it.
so he will ask you, "Do you admit" "to taking the life of your child?
and you'll have to say, "Yes.
but that would be a lie.
can't she just say it's possible she did it by accident?
no, because if it's an accident, there's no intent.
she'd have to admit to the crime, which includes intent.
I c... I can't.
I... I just can't.
honey... - I'm sorry, Blake.
I can't say I killed my baby.
I just can't say that.
okay, we'll recall the nurse to address Julie's comments to the doctor, and then we'll call our doctors to argue disassociative state.
and we'll keep going.
any other ideas? Ollie?
Cassie? Am I missing something?
well, maybe just the obvious... she's innocent.
Harry, if she doesn't have the necessary criminal intent, under the law, she is innocent.
I don't think our case is in the toilet.
I really don't.
Hi, honey. How are you? Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, where are you?
I don't see the fridge with the kids' drawings on it.
well, I'm not at home. I'm in a lawyer's office.
what the hell for?
is everything all right?
everything's fine.
the lawyer's name is Tommy Jefferson.
and...
Hello, Captain. Uh, Tommy Jefferson.
it's an honor, sir.
what's going on?
you remember Corporal Dave Kerwin?
lucky? Sure I remember him.
well, Dave hasn't been so lucky since he's been back, sir.
Hey, Captain.
Hello, Dave.
do you remember when Dave was wounded?
very well.
two men killed, one lost a leg, two others needed surgery, and Dave.
Dave was also wounded, Captain.
a concussion.
minor traumatic brain injury.
an injury that's clearly eligible for the Purple Heart under military rules.
Yes, I know that now.
you know that now?
Mr. Jefferson, as I'm sure you're aware, there's been a big dust-up over this whole Purple Heart thing.
I don't want to argue about the past with you.
Dave, have you got the medical paperwork that establishes your injury?
he does.
then when I receive a copy of that,
I will reverse my previous decision and recommend you for the Purple Heart.
just like that?
it was a mistake.
one I'm willing to fix.
is my wife still there?
Yes.
well, that cuts through it.
God, I can't believe it.
we'll get the document to your captain by PDF and get on it.
how long you think it'll take?
Hey! We're gonna PDF the document to you as soon as we get off.
how soon before you can respond?
have you filled out DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Records?
well, yes, but I thought once you changed your recommendation, we didn't need that anymore.
Oh, no, this still has to go through all the channels.
you get that form going, I'll send my change of recommendation up the chain of command, and then we'll see where we are.
any idea how long that will take, sir?
no, sir.
can I talk to my wife?
that could take forever.
do not despair.
that guy from the Korean War...
he got hung up with DD Form 149.
I read it. - Dave.
I'll kick whatever ass I need to.
- I wish I was there, too. - We'll make this happen.
I'll be home soon. Hey, Dave.
what are you up to these days?
you working at all? - Ah, ah!
uh, y-yes, sir.
Yeah, I have a job.
that's fantastic. What line of work?
precision instruments?
man, you could build anything, I remember your hands.
precision?
no, sir.
I'm a clown.
come again?
I'm a clown.
Rachel. - Really?
Hey. Okay.
45 seconds?
that's it? Are you kidding me?
I know he's busy, but 45 seconds?
I'm not complaining, I am grateful, I'm just...
45 seconds is more than enough. Thank you, Rachel.
45 seconds? Tommy.
I got an audience with Congressman Michael Barnes.
what? You did?
only for 45 seconds, but...
let's go. - No, just me.
Rachel said she got me an audience of one, specifically me.
specifically not you. - When?
10: 15, which means I got to go.
access to treatment, support services, especially when it comes to brain injuries.
I don't think I need to tell you the shocking statistics.
fully one-third of our veterans are homeless.
6, 000 commit suicide every single year.
their unemployment rate is through the roof, and since I only have 45 seconds, I would love for you to actually pay attention for some of it.
I'm listening, keep talking. I multitask.
now, listen, call John... - These DD forms are known to get tied up in bureaucratic thickets.
the captain has changed his recommendation, so the only thing that would hold this up is this lousy form, and...
damn it, Senator!
these Purple Hearts... they may seem like just something to hang on a wall, but they mean a lot more to the soldiers.
they remind them that their sacrifice was worth something to this country, and...
and it should mean something to you.
Alan? - Adam.
we're done here. It's done. - It's done?
tell your soldier he's gonna get his Purple Heart.
and I'd like to get his number, please.
I'd like to call him and personally thank him for his sacrifice.
I'll get you that number!
you were present when my client made these comments to Dr. Robbins about the morphine drip?
I was.
did it alarm you?
not at all. I felt it was only natural.
natural? - She was a grieving mother.
her grief was over the suffering of her child.
and you didn't think it reflected any homicidal intent?
no.
and, Nurse O'Malley, I'm just curious about the morphine drip.
I mean, we do it for suffering older people, with cancer patients.
why not anencephalic babies?
well, we do not technically help people to die.
that would be illegal.
we couch the morphine drip under "pain management," and the morphine is for pain.
it just so happens it shuts down the respiratory system and causes death.
it's a perverted distinction without a difference, but it is what it is.
so why not do it with these babies? - We probably should.
but these babies don't appear to be suffering any pain.
but often they do die as infants.
is that because doctors are running around pinching nostrils?
no. It's because the baby's nutrition and hydration are cut off.
nutrition and hydration.
we starve them to death? Yes.
that sounds a... a little inhumane.
I mean, isn't it ridiculous we would euthanize a suffering dog, but for a human being, we starve them to death?
objection. - Sustained.
when we discontinue nutrition and hydration... is this painful?
we don't know.
but the organs dry up. They shrivel and shrink, and one by one, they close down.
it can't be a lot of fun. - So...
if my client did this... I'm not saying she did, but if she did, if she twisted the neck...
that would be more humane.
probably, yes.
we certainly can't advocate that mothers...
I mean... how could we even rely on them to know how to snap a neck in such a clinical way as to cause instantaneous death?
I mean, that seems like something only a medical professional would know.
don't you agree, Nurse O'Malley?
wouldn't you agree, Nurse O'Malley?
throughout this whole proceeding, there's only been one given...
that the child died in my client's arms.
but what if he didn't?
and if not by my client's hand, then whose?
you were the only other person to hold the child that night.
come to think of it, it was your idea that Julie hold the child.
you woke her up just before 4: 00 to do so...
middle of the night, very few others around...
and then, as you took the infant from her... snap.
just one little jerking twist and no more suffering.
the D. A. was right.
this was a mercy killing.
he just had the wrong angel of mercy.
didn't he, Eileen?
you've gone a little quiet.
did you kill that baby, Eileen?
did you kill that baby?
I'd like to speak to an attorney, please.
that was exciting.
is it really over?
it will be, and they'll question her, but the D. A. has indicated either way he'll dismiss it.
there's no way he can make anything stick against you.
thank you.
thank you for believing in me.
you can thank Cassie.
she's the one who said we could be missing the obvious...
that you're innocent... and it got me thinking.
I figured, if not you, then who?
and I rolled the dice.
Julie, I owe you a big apology.
I, I didn't believe you.
but I do now.
a month? - Five, six weeks at most.
I don't know what to say to you both.
thank you" just doesn't seem like enough.
Dave, listen.
my father, may he rest in peace, cranky old bastard.
world War II hero.
in late 1943 he was with the Fifth Army in the Bernhardt Line offensive.
he took a bullet to his leg, and for that, they gave him this.
thing was...
he died before he got it.
because the paperwork got lost, he...
he never got to, uh, to wear something that he would have...
let's call this a loaner, shall we?
when you get yours, give this one back.
until then, my father would be proud that you wore it.
soldier.
is there any reason to fear the suspect might be armed?
well, you're partner's already asked me that, what, four times?
I'm faster than my partner. The kid takes off I'll be the one who catches him, so I'm asking.
is there any chance this kid might have a weapon? He won't be armed.
I think we got him.
that's his car. Let's go.
Hey, Scott.
talk for a second? Just talk.
Hey, get off me! Get off of me!
get off me! You can't do this! - They're not gonna let go of you, Scott. Just calm down.
let me go! Get off me!
son, it's time to come home.- No-No.
you can't do this-- what gives you the right to do this?!
I'm your father. It's time to come home, son.
excuse me. Harry Korn?
yes? - Hi.
I'm Margaret Albertson, you're next- door neighbor.
Oh, right, right.
well, we really haven't officially met.
uh, well, uh, welcome to the neighborhood. - I've been here five years.
Oh, well, um... it's nice to finally meet you.
Harry, have you noticed anything weird lately?
I'm a lawyer, weird is about all I see.
I mean, in the neighborhood.
Oh, if this is about some kind of neighborhood watch or whatever.- It's not that.
I'll buy whistles, or orange vests, or whatever.
I saw a UFO last night.
why not?
I mean, I saw something-- it was a flying thing with lights on it, and it was kind of hovering over my backyard.
I really got to get to work.
would you just do me one favor?
when you get home tonight, will you just go out in your backyard and just look up and see if you see anything?
no problem.
it's kidnapping.
no, it isn't. - Yes it is.
of course it is. You can't just snatch a kid off the street and...
where is he now?
home. Where he should be. - What makes you sure he won't just run away again?
he won't. - Why?!
cause he's locked in a basement.
you just gonna keep asking me questions?
he's locked in a basement?! - What's going on?
he had a teenage kid hauled off the street.
they bring him back to his house where he's now locked in a basement!
what's the problem? - "What's the problem?
Cassie, will you tell them parents can't just kidnap their kid and lock him up?
how old? Sixteen.
not kidnapping. Cream?
what the... Did you not hear the part about being locked in a basement?
this is soy. Do we have any regular cream?
can't he just be emancipated if he has a full-time job?
not in Ohio, he can't.
Oh, it's not enough I got to deal with nut jobs all day long.
turns out I live next to one. Oliver kidnapped a 16-year-old boy.
fantastic. This better not be decaf.
I'm already having a day. You need to get your ass downstairs.
Why? - Just get down there.
what do you mean, you're on strike?
we love working for Harry, and we have no problem working for you.
then what? More money? - It's not the money.
then what? - It's her, Chunhua. She's abusive.
Chinua is abusive? You don't see it 'cause you're all goo-goo eyed-- try working for her for ten minutes - First of all, I'm not all goo-goo eyed for her. - Right. Right. Right.
what does she do? - What doesn't she do?
we have a strict dress code.
we get docked if we're so much as a minute late for work.
we get docked if the register doesn't balance out to the penny.
we get docked if we don't smile.
it's dock, dock, dock-- by the time she's through docking us we owe her money at the end of the day.
she's a fascist terrorist, Adam. And you just don't see it.
I ask them to dress executive-chic.
I insist on punctuality.
as for balancing the books, that shouldn't be a crime.
okay, but they think you're mean. They said I'm mean?
they said "fascist" actually. "Mean" was my word.
I'm not asking the girls to do anything but fulfill their job responsibilities.
hello.
Hey, hey. I am looking for... Olivier.
Oliver. That's me. Hi.
I'm Phoebe Blake, nice to meet you. - Oliver Richard.
Wow. This place is kind of cool.
Yeah. Can I help you with something?
Oh, yeah. You have a client of mine.
Scott Denchy. 16, dark, curly hair, a little pissed off. Okay.
first of all, I don't have him. - Yeah. His parents do, his legal guardians.
you kidnapped him on a street. You and a bunch of thugs Okay.
wrestled him to the ground. It was an intervention, it wasn't kidnapping.
there's a difference. Dragged him to a van.
how do you even know what happened, if I may ask? - He fired off one call before you took his phone.
it was to me. He should've called the police.
Hi. - You represent the boy?
I do. And if he's not released I'm afraid I'm gonna have to stir up some trouble.
not for you, but for G. I...
Hi.
look, the boy's only 16.
don't you think his parents know what's best for him?
I don't, actually, and neither does he, which is why he left in the first place.
so, are we returning him, or do I make the trouble?
we're not returning him.
river City. Ciao.
at least I'm on solid legal grounds, right? - As far as the intervention's concerned, yes.
but, I mean, how violent did it go down?
tackled him, wrestled-- it was kind of like dating.
so, no aversion therapy? You didn't waterboard him?
no. Just a shrink to talk him into going back to school.
just a talk, that's all.
I had no idea that you were such a fan of talk, Ollie.
what do you mean? - Are we ever gonna discuss what's going on between you and I?
well...
sure.
you start.
we slept together after the gala.
are we a thing, or was that just a one-off? - Well, I...
just thought we would kind of... take it slow...
see where it goes.
before I do anything tonight, I'd just like to say a few things.
are you okay? Just have a seat.
can we get some water or something?
this whole night has been like a bad dream. - Oh, God.
did you see that thing in the sky?
it's permitted.
I'll ask you again, did you see that thing in the sky?
ma'am, I think you just shot down our drone.
you took it down? - One shot.
just a few questions, if you don't mind.
starting with what the hell is the Cincinnati Police Department doing with a drone?
ms. Korn?
captain Pearson, CPD.
uh, listen, uh... this is a little embarrassing.
you think? He's fine, he's my lawyer on this.
Tommy Jefferson. Well, you don't need a lawyer, ma'am; you're not in trouble.
you are. What are you spying on me for?
well, we weren't. We were spying on your neighbor.
my neighbor? The whacko next door?
she's a schoolteacher. And, uh, we suspect, a sex offender.
drone?
Really? Well, cops are evidently using them now.
I mean, talk about 1984. I mean, it was hovering in my trees-- you should've seen it.
did you find out anything? - Only that she was brought in for questioning.
probation says she has no record.
what's going on downstairs?
I'm dealing with it. - Yeah.
not at all well.
and where the hell have you two been?
it's 9: 15. Uh-huh.
I got calls from reporters about your abduction.
seems your little Phoebe friend has already begun to make trouble. Yeah.
she filed a motion for his release-- listen, I'm headed back to court right now.
if you'd like to join, I could use the help. - You don't get it.
Cassie, if you're free, maybe you'd like to give Ollie a hand.
what's that supposed to mean?
Lisa, I got a meeting up here shortly with the staff from downstairs-- you think you could mind the store for a bit?
I-I'll clear it with Tommy. - I'd be happy to.
may I speak to you? I am not a sex offender.
I am not. - Margaret, what's going on?
I teach third grade.
I had some medical issues with my family, which I had to take a second job to cover the expenses.
there's this, uh, internet site called...
it's one of those specialty sites.
they pay $500 to full-bodied women who put themselves on video... naked.
Oh, boy.
I made a few audition pieces, but I never submitted them.
I decided not to.
well, if you never submitted them, did you tell anybody?
no.
I did make some inquiries into the site before I...
you know, the thing is, my computer was hacked not long ago.
and I had to change some passwords and stuff.
maybe whoever hacked my computer called the police, or maybe it was the police who did the hacking.
What'd you do in these audition pieces?
I just, uh... danced. In a sexual way.
so that's why the police were spying on you?
it must be.
anyway, it's, uh... it's all out now.
I've been fired by the school.
they think I'm some kind of porn...
I was wondering...
Harry, I realize you don't know me.
and I'm not a depraved person.
I was wondering if, um, you might help me.
the boy is locked up in a basement?
at the moment, no.
both parties have agreed to let him out pending the decision of this hearing.
this is all because Scott doesn't want to go to college.
it's because he dropped out of high school at age 16.
it's because he ran away from home. When we grabbed him, he was living with no guardian.
my clients, his parents, did what any parents would do, which would be to get their son back with the ultimate intent of getting him reenrolled in school.
it's what parents do
anything they can to properly safeguard the welfare of their minor child.
here's the thing, Judge.
Scott Denchy doesn't abuse drugs, he has no criminal record.
the place he ran away to is a decent apartment in a safe neighborhood which he rents with money he makes at a full-time job, a job he quite loves, with a small start-up.
he was quite happy to live at home, loves his parents, but they forced him to go to school, they constantly undermine his employment.
he's a kid. - Yes, you win that point.
he is 16, he's a minor, he's underage, he's not 18...
he has no right to emancipation under Ohio law. Right.
look, let's just cut through it. He dropped out of school, ran away, and the concerned parents want to get him back home. I mean, I...
you know, Judge, I'm not wild about the way you made that sound.
will you at least hear from my client before he's returned to serve out the remainder of his sentence?
the court has no jurisdiction to interfere in the home, absent the allegation of abuse...
okay, fine, we'll allege it then. Abuse.
abuse. Hmm?
all right, I'll hear from the boy at 2: 00. - Thank you.
okay.
let's start with the dress code.
a lot of salespeople are subjected to this.
Adam, she inspects us.
she makes us stand in front of her like West Point cadets.
okay. This is going to sound really bad, but...
go ahead, it's why we're here.
you come from a culture where employees are not valued.
this isn't China.
are you sure it's my culture, and not yours?
american workers don't want to work.
you want the paycheck. You want the health care. You're first in line for any perks.
but when it comes to doing the actual job... - You see? You see?
Hmm... Look...
this isn't working out.
I'm afraid I must terminate your employment.
I see no other way. I wish you all the best.
she fired all of 'em? - Harry, she could be in the right.
Oh, balls! Congratulations, Adam.
you hired your old flame back.
you know, she torpedoed my shoe store, but hey, you're getting laid!
I'm not getting laid!
what the hell is wrong with you?!
first, the good news
the police aren't charging you with anything.
what they saw on their spy-cam
it evidently established you not so much as a sex offender as an adult entertainer.
Oh, my God.
the school doesn't want any of their third-grade teachers moonlighting in anything porn-related.
they're not going to hire you back. - At all?
I'm afraid not.
what I did-- it was stupid, but it wasn't illegal.
I realize that.
and I did it in the privacy of my own home. - I know that, too.
I never even sent the videos out.
but you made it, which, for the school, was enough.
can I sue? - Well, your claim would have to be against the police for invasion of privacy.
could you sue to force the school to take you back?
that'd be tough.
what will I do?
teaching is my whole life. - Unfortunately to the school, it wasn't quite all of it.
this isn't fair. - No, it isn't.
about as unfair as it gets.
Margaret, you understand schools better than I do.
you can appreciate the power
I want to sue
breaks my heart. This is such a beautiful shoe.
I know. I have wide feet myself, so I know the feeling.
may I make a suggestion? - Anything, if it'll get my foot into this shoe.
you can't wear hose, that's the negative, but, um, give me your foot for a second, I'll show you.
I use this salve.
it's non-greasy, but it's just enough of a lubricant.
give me your foot for a second.
I really don't. - You can't just fire people en masse.
I'm interviewing all afternoon.
I promise we'll be re-staffed by tomorrow. - It isn't just that, Chunhua.
managing staff is more than just... Human relations do count.
I am always respectful. I think if I weren't Chinese...
you heard what Debbie said. It was bigotry, Adam.
as was your slight of the American worker. - What is it that I'm doing wrong?
I am courteous, I do not make them work overtime, I do not bully.
I'm simply exacting. Life was a party here with Jenna.
now we're a profit center.
all they care about is whether I go to Harvard or Yale.
course tutors, SAT coaches, college-AP counselors.
they try to steer me towards these internships, which they think is going to impress these big Ivy League schools.
I'm telling you, they are out of control.
come on, Scott, you just described most of the parents in the country.
okay, maybe I did.
perhaps those parents have kids who want to go to Harvard or Yale.
I don't. - Where do you want to go?
to work. At my job.
at a place called IDEA EGG. I want to think, I want to create now.
I don't want to waste my time in SAT prep classes or essay workshops.
and I don't want to go to college to read Homer in between keg parties.
college has nothing to offer me. - Scott, you're a kid.
do you really think you can be the arbiter of what's best for you?
let me tell you something. In the high-tech world, 16 is the new 30.
I love my parents.
I do. But they're blocking my way.
Scott, you ever think you might want to switch careers someday?
you have any idea how difficult it is to find a job without a college degree?
do you know how hard it is to find a job with one?
I do. And the fact that so many kids that are graduating universities still can't find work should tell you how tough the marketplace is.
no, it tells me how devalued a college education is becoming, in part because it's artificial.
look, you want to be a doctor, you want to be a lawyer...
...you want to speak Latin to your grandkids, go to college.
but for what I want to do, it isn't necessary.
I don't need it, and I don't want it.
and I shouldn't have it jammed down my throat.
my opinion, this can't be won.
I didn't ask for your opinion. Just tell me what you found.
basically, the police got a tip that she was a sexual predator.
they didn't have enough probable cause to get a search warrant, so they dispatched their new toy.
the drone. - Yeah, it's called a MAV
a Micro Air Vehicle-- very new.
more and more departments are deploying them.
the military uses them to scan dangerous areas before they send in their troops, and now the police want to use them in the same way.
or to spy on people. - Or that.
it's a flat-out violation of the Fourth Amendment-- Warrantless Search 101.
the problem is, who do we sue? I mean, the police?
that's not gonna get her job back. - We'd get damages.
not much, we wouldn't.
when you got a third-grade teacher who's potentially a sex offender, people would rather err on the side of invading privacy.
I'm not big on fat, naked sex tapes, but this is wrong.
well, let's at least file against the school, see if we can leverage her job back, and settle this somehow.
why aren't you in the store? - She dismissed me.
excuse me? Your little friend-- she fired me.
she was rubbing the customers' feet in an inappropriate manner.
they didn't complain. - It's not appropriate.
how 'bout we hire the girls back, and we start fresh. Can we do that?
hire them back? - I really think we can work this out. I do.
would I still be in charge? - Yes. You are the shoe store administrator.
that doesn't change. - So I'm still running it now?
of course. - Fine.
the girls stay fired. I'm replacing them.
push us around! What do we do?
stand our ground! Rules aren't fair!
boss doesn't care! What do they do?
push us around! What do we do?
stand our ground! Rules aren't fair!
boss doesn't care!
I don't like crossing picket lines to come into my own place of business.
we commit zero unfair trade practices. My father taught me the rules precisely.
all right. I got to go to court this morning.
when I get back, I want to see you in my office.
what do we do? Stand our ground! This is his junior year.
it's critical.
of all the times for him to rebel and not take school seriously...
but you've been listening; your son doesn't like school.
well, what kid does?
and, look, the idea that we've created an abusive environment by insisting he get a proper education...
well, I think your son would maintain that what he's interested in in life doesn't require a higher education.
what he's interested in in life"? He's 16 years old.
right now, he's into girls. He likes hanging out with his friends.
he likes being able to sleep in in the morning. - Does Scott sleep in in the morning?
well, he hasn't been living at home, so I wouldn't exactly know.
he's at his job at dawn on time.
he doesn't spend his time hanging out with friends or chasing girls.
he makes $72, 000 a year at a steady job doing something he quite loves, - and learning, by the way. - Do you know what he does for a living?
tell me.
he invents some sort of social app that can be used on Twitter.
he's gonna drop out of school for that? Really?
I'm told you were shocked when Scott decided to quit school.
shocked" isn't the word.
because he always seemed like such a mature kid, right?
thoughtful, organized, clear-headed.
you've always described him that way, haven't you, Mrs. Denchy?
well, he hasn't been clear-headed with this.
I'm told fear can cloud judgment sometimes.
does he strike you as afraid? - Afraid?
no. - Are you?
are you afraid, Mrs. Denchy?
I mean, the idea of a kid leaving high school would terrify most parents.
are you terrified just a bit?
Yes, I am.
Yeah.
it's a different world now, isn't it?
as different as it may be, Ms. Blake, a boy still has his best chance in life by going to college, and you don't get there by dropping out of high school to invent Twitter apps.
it's certainly normal for a loving parent to have dreams for her child.
what parent wouldn't?
the question would be: Do his dreams count?
ms. Blake, maybe one day, you'll have a family.
come talk to me when your son says he wants to drop out of high school.
you want me to order the school to hire her back?
that's exactly what I want, Your Honor.
the school's action was based on a profound and illegal invasion of privacy.
it violates public policy
not to mention good conscience-- to allow it to stand.
the school did not invade her privacy.
the police did. - Then your issue is with the police.
no, it's with you, because you represent the school that fired her.
how did the police even tumble to this rumor about your client?
that we're still trying to figure out, Judge.
it's possible her computer was hacked or this Web site was being monitored.
my client did make inquiries to it online, but the point is that the police learned of the existence of these videos as a result of using this drone.
I mean, the police used this thing to look into her upstairs bedroom window.
while she was putting herself on video? - Evidently.
these videos, on a depravity scale of one to ten...
you don't want to see them, Judge.
what he means is you shouldn't see them because it's a further violation of my client's right...
counsel, she's a third-grade teacher.
if she's been intimate with barnyard animals... - She has not.
have you?- No!
all these videos entail is a lot of suggestive... movement.
have you seen them? - No.
and neither has the principal of the school, frankly, but-but come on-- she made sex tapes.
that's enough. She teaches kids. - Quite well, by the way.
I mean, her teaching record is exemplary. She's been beyond reproach for 15 years.
until now. It's reproach time.
okay. I think I need to see these videos.
I need to have some idea about what we're talking about.
now, what the hell's going on down there? - Well, clearly, I'm unpopular.
that much is obvious. But I really don't think I've been out of bounds.
I asked the sales girls to put their grievances in writing, which they did.
Tommy reviewed them.
I read them myself.
you haven't committed any unfair labor practices, which is a relief.
and looking at our gross revenues, clearly, you're doing a lot right down there.
but...
you've failed miserably at managing human resources.
start talking.
I really don't want to point fingers. - Chunhua, your job is on the line.
start talking.
Jenna let them take extended lunches. I don't.
Jenna let them leave early. I don't.
Jenna gave them employee discounts. I don't.
Jenna gave them automatic bonuses. Mine are merit-based.
Jenna was more interested in being their friend.
my role is primarily boss. They don't like having a boss.
so you lay all this on Jenna. - Of course not.
I obviously need to work on my people skills.
something else?
there's another problem at play here. I can tell.
is it me? Say it.
it isn't you.
then who? - Adam.
Adam. - I am beyond grateful to him.
don't get me wrong.
he gave me this job, which... not everybody wanted me to have.
But?
he enjoys flirting with the girls, being buddies with them.
they feel they can run to him behind my back, which they often do, and perhaps did here.
Adam is a wonderful person.
I will always be indebted to him. But he's soft.
he's especially soft with pretty women.
it's a problem.
are you kidding me? You give these girls a false sense of entitlement.
of all the people to turn on!
Adam, the girls feel they have tenure because you'll protect them. It's counterproductive.
so you just went running to Harry behind my back.
no, Harry summoned me to her office, and then pushed me for a full explanation.
well, in the future, if you have a problem with me, I would appreciate you taking it up with me.
that's fair.
but I didn't realize the severity of the problem until the girls went on strike.
she's out of her mind. - Is she?
could you give us a second, please?
I think we should just let her go. - On what grounds?
on what grounds?
Adam, this gets a little complicated since you were intimate with her.
I told you it would be a mistake to hire her, but you didn't want to listen.
now... I'm hearing it now.
I suggest the two of you just work this out and you fix the problem downstairs, and you do it fast. Otherwise, it could become a Waterloo.
you don't want it to be yours.
your Honor, there's a reason we don't consider 16-year-olds adults.
it's because... they're not.
in fact, a 16-year-old boy is at his most wild, impulsive, reckless, risk-taking peak
when he is most in need of parenting.
when it comes to his future, his junior year in high school is vital.
Yes, there are seemingly more exotic vocations out there, but the fact remains a college education is still the best way to ensure sustained career success.
and for Scott to take a flyer now, in the middle of his junior year, would be catastrophic.
that's why we've taken such extreme measures.
Scott Denchy belongs at home-- in school, with his family.
living alone at age 16. Come on.
there's a company near San Francisco
started by a Stanford grad, by the way
that pays kids not to go to college.
they go after the same kids that Harvard and Princeton want, and they want them now.
Why? Because the human mind is at its innovative peak between the ages 16 and 25.
for kids like Scott, the time is now.
we have scads of schools spewing out college graduates in droves.
how many of us even remember what we learned in college?
that's one Latin phrase I remember.
seize the day.
and Scott Denchy is trying to seize his.
now, if we could turn for a second from Scott's future to the future of this country...
is he saving the country now, as well?
who knows? He might.
one thing we know for certain-- college ain't getting it done.
we're turning out a nation of test takers and worker bees.
college does a lousy job of breeding visionaries.
missing in action are the big ideas, the big thinkers.
I mean, as a result, innovation in the United States has stagnated.
it's why we're falling behind the rest of the world.
we need kids who embrace the radical, who think out of the box, and we need them when their imaginations are firing on all cylinders, which sometimes, yes, can be 16, 17, 18 years old.
Scott Denchy is ready to get started.
he's fired up, and he wants to change the world, your kids' future, mine.
why don't we let him try?
a schoolt eacher doing sex dances, as caught on video by a drone.
I'm getting a lot of media requests to be in the room.
I really have no basis to keep them out.
now, I will hear from you, Counsel, if you wish to present a summation.
but I've seen these videos, and as legal as the conduct in question may be, as private as they should have remained, I'm inclined to err on the side of the children.
now, my suggestion is we just let this go away now and not compound your client's embarrassment in a more public arena.
this just seems so unfair. - I didn't give him an answer.
it's your call, Margaret.
I could go in and thump my chest if you want, but...
his mind seemed pretty made up.
with media in the room, it just becomes a bigger story.
I was just trying to make a little extra money, you know?
I never meant... - I know.
the government spied into my bedroom.
I want you to fight.
then that's what I'll do.
and Harry...
whatever happens, thank you.
not just for representing me but for not judging me.
the looks I get from everybody now.
thank you.
time to go thump my chest.
all rise.
okay.
Mr. White, I think I know where you're coming from. You have anything you want to add?
only this, Judge.
the petitioner's outrage aside, the expectation of privacy in this country is all but dead.
we have cameras on street corners, in parking lots, in stores, elevators.
google Earth basically has the world under surveillance, and we have over 100 million people walking around with smartphone videocams.
life is rapidly becoming one big YouTube moment.
in fact, the drone caught her taping a YouTube moment of sorts.
she never sent any videos out.
look, ever since we began the War on Terror, people have come to expect being snooped on.
the government has been doing so for years with drones, wiretaps.
they intercept e-mails, monitor Facebook.
our garbage is inspected, we are X-rayed at the airport, and it has all become almost routine, and certainly, if you're going to put something on video or online, even in e-mail form, chances are, it's going to come out. Ask Scarlett Johansson.
Yeah, Scarlett won't return my calls.
judge, it's like you say.
given that this woman teaches our young schoolchildren, we have to err on the side of our kids' safety.
it's that simple.
well, Judge, you might not care to hear what I have to say, but I sure as hell hope you were listening to him.
the Fourth Amendment "doesn't matter.
people figure to be spied on.
our expectation of privacy is all but dead.
perhaps he's right.
you know, since this story broke, I've seen or heard very little outrage.
nobody seems too concerned about a drone having a look-see on a potential sex perv.
maybe people don't give a crap about the Bill of Rights.
clearly, the police don't. That's the very reason a judge needs to.
the government used technology to go right into a person's bedroom and spy on that person's private life.
that's worst-case scenario, Your Honor. That's George Orwell's nightmare
big Brother coming into our bedrooms.
I mean, if you don't care now, then when?
no one's defending the government's conduct here, least of all me.
but you're allowing this woman to be victimized by it.
Yes, and if your daughter or granddaughter were in this woman's third-grade classroom...
Oh, that's right. Let's protect our kids.
Yeah, that's, that's the big trump card, isn't it?
let's err on the side of our children's safety.
well, if so, then let's go whole hog.
we have over 700, 000 registered sex offenders in this country
700000
why not spy on all of 'em? And, hell, while we're at it, we've got hundreds of thousands of drug dealers selling drugs to our kids in school.
you know, let's turn the drones loose on 'em.
you know, come to think of it, if safety is the issue, let's just go into everybody's homes.
you know, we'll all be more safe.
if you ask me, our Founding Fathers cherished a few things more than safety, one being liberty
our right to be free in our homes from unwarranted government searches.
the kind of freedom that separates us from Syria and China or the Soviet Union of old, perhaps Arizona.
the kind of freedom that's associated with America.
and the idea that you, sitting up there in that chair, wearing that robe...
would declare the Fourth Amendment dead?
that's obscene.
that's just obscene.
Mr. White, have there ever been any complaints filed against the petitioner by students, former students, or parents?
as far as I'm aware, no, Judge.
she's been a fairly decorated teacher until now.
ms. Korn,
I have no authority to order the school to hire your client back, but...
Mr. White, that your client return this teacher to her class.
we're adjourned.
what? Did I win?
close enough. This we can work with.
all right, I won't tell you two how to parent, but safe to say you're not doing a great job at the moment.
and you, you certainly seem smart enough to know you'd be better off at home.
you know, if I was your dad, Scott,
I'd try to get you to at least finish high school first, then go take this job.
failing that, uh, maybe go to night school.
sure as hell make it a hell of a lot easier to go to college down the road, son, should you decide to do that.
but I'm not your dad, so...
you obviously have a very smart kid here. And you, you obviously got two parents committed to doing what's best for you.
so this is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna kick this back to you very reasonable folks for a week to work it out.
if you can't, then I will toss it to Child Services.
you understand?
better keep an open mind about college, son.
and you folks keep an open mind about... Twitter.
all right? Thank you.
I think we'll just head home. And maybe we can begin talking?
I just want to be able to live my life, Dad.
let's agree to work on your life together. Honey, we've always been a family.
let's go home.
we'll be in touch.
Thanks. - Yeah, you got it.
so, you work on him a little, I'll work on them.
sounds good. - You got my number?
Yeah, I got your number.
very funny, Tommy. - You made me proud, Harry.
bill of Rights. America.
you were unbelievable. - Thanks.
Harry, I'm headed home.
sorry for all the, uh, tumult, but, uh, the store's re-staffed, everything's up and running.
I think we're back in business.
okay. Night, Adam.
night. Damn it.
mind of its own. Sorry. - Cut it out!
you need a mind of your own.
bug. Schlock.
Gnat!- Roach!
it's just our way.
listen, Harry, I know my opinion doesn't count for much around here.
you'd be surprised. But you are some lady.
you fought for America today.
some lady, indeed.
...no parent in their right mind would want this porn princess in the classroom with seven-year-old children!
do we want her molding the minds of our children?
I don't think so. But Harry Korn disagrees.
what kind of judge puts a sex freak in charge of a class of third-graders?
what are they drinking in Ohio?
we have a duty, people, to protect our children from Margaret Albertson.
Cincinnati and Cincinnati public schools...
...I'm watching you.
george Tucker and Lemon Breeland are getting married.
that is how this story ends. - George, I thought you knew I decided to stay.
he still has feelings for me. - He chose Lemon.
now, you show up at that wedding, he's gonna chose her again.
lemon, I cannot marry you, not when a part of me is in love with someone else.
doc, I'm not saying I want to marry you.
all I'm saying is there's something here. - Zoe, I thought that if you went to New York,
I might be able to put you out of my mind and maybe I could have, but now I know that I can't.
and I don't want to.
it's devastating.
before today, I never really knew what "torn asunder" meant.
I think we know who's to blame.
you're right, the Lord's hand is in all things.
I'm seeing someone else's hand in this one.
move back.
you don't want to be the first thing she sees when she wakes up.
she may swallow you whole before you can blink.
it is heartbreaking. - Shh! Shh!
lemon was supposed to move into George's place today.
and I was gonna move into her room!
magnolia, this is not about you.
lemon has been planning her future with George Tucker for years.
what is she gonna do now?!
it is no worse than Jake leaving me.
I survived and Lemon will, too. - Lemon is not like you.
she cares what people think. - I care what people think.
then, sweetheart, reconsider that dress.
how is she gonna walk through this town again?
the humiliation.
personally, I would up and die if it happened to me.
up and die.
I can hear you.
I said move back.
well, I can't say I'm surprised to see you.
I know. I heard.
Oh, God. Oh, no.
I can explain. - What is there to explain?
george cancelled his wedding, presumably, for you.
Oh, George.
Yeah, George. He did. - So why don't you look happier?
okay, I'm just going to tell you because I have to tell someone.
don't judge. - Okay.
last night, while George was calling off his wedding,
I was kinda having sex with Wade.
Wade? - Mm-hmm.
and how'd that work out for you?
let's just say I finally understand what R. Kelly's been singing about all these years.
but it was more than amazing sex.
Wade and I...
connected. Maybe there's more to him than I thought.
you know, if George hadn't showed up last night, Wade and I might...
but George did show up. - Exactly. And George is George.
you know how I feel about him. - Zoe Hart, you went from no boyfriends to two in one night.
turns out that I have way more game than I thought.
question is, which one are you gonna keep? - Exactly.
which one, Lavon? - That question was for you.
Yeah, but I don't know. And you're my best friend.
so, you need to advise me. Look inside your soul.
picture me with both guys. Who I look happier with?
you really need to get a girlfriend. - I know, but you're all I have.
look, all I know is that Wade just slept with the girl that he's been pining for for months,
george just called off his wedding for the girl he's been pining for for months.
one of them is going to get hurt.
but if it was me, I would be honest with both of them before it blows up in your face.
that's your best idea? I really do need a girlfriend.
or you could cash in your honeymoon tickets and take a cruise.
stay away till the dust settles. - I could come with you.
two single ladies on the high seas. Hello, sailor.
I am not going on a singles cruise, AnnaBeth. I've been single for one day.
just that some of 'em do Broadway shows. I could finally see Hairspray.
or you can move to another town. Change your name.
something like Lennon Breeland. Or Linden Breeland.
I'm not leaving town just because I got dumped.
I'm going to show this town that my happiness does not depend on George Tucker marrying me.
I am a survivor.
me, too.
maybe we could survive in one of those nice beach hotels in Bon Secour for a couple days.
I'm gonna make my fresh start right here in BlueBell.
first thing, I'm gonna get my own place.
what? When? - You're what?
today. What? I'm already packed.
I'll move into your bedroom. - Lemon, no.
living on your own is like saying you've given up.
it's one step away from letting your hair go gray and caring about animals.
lemon, you need your family around you right now. Let us take care of you.
no, Daddy, you are missing the point.
I don't need anyone to take care of me.
I am Lemon Breeland, strong Southern Belle, and I will rise again.
without help. On my own.
Annabeth. - Yeah, oh, yeah.
George. What are you doing here?
well, I was coming by to thank Lavon for all his help last night, but it's good to see you this fine morning, Miss Hart. Actually, now that I think about it, maybe thanking Lavon can wait just a second.
I know I'm still just processing it all.
what is there to process?
I called off my wedding for you.
that is what they call a grand romantic gesture.
it was just all so sudden. - That's what makes it grand.
but, George, you have to admit, I mean, it's a little crazy. You just broke up with Lemon yesterday.
all I know is that I chose you.
and I want you. And I know you feel the same way.
well, fancy meeting you two here.
Tucker, I thought you'd be on your, uh, honeymoon by now.
see, if you wouldn't have flaked last night, you would've known that I called off the wedding.
right, sorry I missed that.
I, uh, had my hands full.
mini muffin?
Wade, mini muffin? George, mini muffin?
don't mind if I do. Yeah.
and, uh, thanks again for last night, Doc.
that, uh, house call totally cured my affliction.
good muffin.
no.
no, you got to be kidding me.
I thought you were getting married. - I know, but Wade?
you and Wade?
Wade and you?
stop saying that.
Wade and Zoe. Zoe and Wade.
it just happened.
you got feelings for him?
okay, honest.
um, I'm not sure.
I-I see. Okay.
no, but, George, you know how I feel about you.
none of this is what I expected to happen.
I just, I need some time t-to think.
Yeah, how long do you think that's gonna take? Just ballpark it for me.
a week or a month or... You know, I just turned my life upside down for you, so if you're gonna run off with someone else, then I'd like to know as soon as possible.
I know... - Okay. All right.
Wh...
did I, uh, miss anything? - Just be honest with them?
you are the worst girlfriend in the whole world.
well, well, well.
alabama certainly has changed you.
Yes, Lord.
you are a walking country song, Dr. Hart.
I should have told you about George calling off the wedding earlier. That was him at the door last night.
Yeah.
is that's why you were so tired when you came back to bed?
well, why aren't you smiling?
figure you'd be happier than a dead pig in the sunshine now that Mr. Wonderful is single.
Wade, stop. You're putting up walls.
I get how you work by now. But you don't have to.
last night, you and I connected.
I'm not just going to forget that. I told George that I needed time to think.
think about what?
Yup. You know, this happens sometimes.
a woman will mistake finally having good sex for a connection.
last night, something happened between us.
Yeah, well, you had A-plus sex for your first time.
what do you mean I had A-plus sex? You had it, too.
right?
Yeah, for me it was more... B?
B-minus. - What?
sorry. - B-minus?
good luck with Goldenboy.
well, it's a mite small, but the location can't be beat.
so, what do you think?
I'll take it.
lemon, this place isn't for you?
Oh, honey, don't you think you'd be better off resting at home, where you can be looked after?
Babs, just give her the application please.
well, I suppose the choice is yours.
just have your father co-sign and we're all set.
Oh, I don't need my father to co-sign.
see, I'm an adult.
I know that, honey, but you don't have any income.
or any prospects of getting any. Or even a credit score.
Babs Foster, you have known me since I was in my mother's womb.
you know that I am good for the rent. - Yes, well, I know Brick is.
you can bring the application by my office later.
okay, well, now what?
I'm going to get myself a job.
and that's all I have to say about that. - Oh, come on, Delma.
no, you come on, Shula, face facts.
george Tucker's had his eye on Zoe Hart since the day she came to this town.
george Tucker is an upstanding man. He's gonna represent my cat in court.
Lindsey Taub's... - Uh, l-ladies? Ladies!
can you gossip while you clean? See-see, we got a bunch of debris over by the church, and in times like these, we need a clear path to the Lord.
Amen, amen. - All right.
listen, I've had enough of you and ...
ladies.
now you see, it's people skills like that that make you such a good mayor.
what's going on, Dash?
mayor Hayes, your reelection is coming up.
and, uh, well, I would love to be your campaign manager.
Yeah, I'd-I'd be honored, but, uh, since Lavon Hayes is running unopposed...
mayor Hayes, if you think you can just get by on your 98. 7% popularity and football legacy,
I'm here to tell you, this little scandal might just bring you down.
scandal? - One word: Zoegate.
many of the voters believe that your little bestie is somehow behind the breakup.
Oh. Oh, no, no.
I'm sure BlueBellians are smarter than that, Dash.
come on, now. - We shall see.
I will not be treated by a home wrecker.
with all that wax in there, I'm surprised you could hear the gossip.
don't look in my ears, home wrecker! - Grandpa!
will you let the doctor do her job? Listen, it's-it's not personal, okay?
he called Ms. Ulvestadt down at the bank a Norwegian spy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my gosh, look at your adorable boots.
I will not look at her boobs. - I said "boots," Gramps.
Oh. - When you remove the wax, can you remove his tongue, too?
Yeah, no problem. - All right, she can look in my ears, but that's it.
only Dr. Breeland can deal with my lower half. - Lucky him.
I'm Ruby. - Hey, I'm Dr. Zoe Hart.
Yes, I've heard a lot about you today.
none of it good, which makes me like you already.
that makes me like you already.
why haven't we met before? - I live in Atlanta.
uh, moved away the day I graduated.
and for obvious reasons, I've never wanted to come back.
well, how have you angered the universe, that it would send you back now?
I just recently sold my cosmetics line and until I figure out my next step,
I've been guilted into visiting family for a few days.
which basically consists of carting Gramps around and having people wonder what kind of mischief I got into in the big city.
I have no idea what that's like. - Of course.
sergeant, you are all set. - Well, it's about time.
Yeah. - Hey, I can hear.
well, Doctor.
good luck with all the home wrecking. - Thank you.
guess Gramps and I are gonna get us some of that sludge that you call coffee at Agnes' bakery.
you know, if you want to stay, I just got a new espresso maker.
well, yeah, fancy. - No, no, no!
if you want the home wrecker's brew, that's your problem.
can you please make mine a double, right now? Thanks.
Emily! - Hello.
Oh, what a nice surprise. Oh, come in.
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am about your daughter's wedding.
well, I know I'm family of the groom but, uh, I hope there's no hard feelings.
Oh, no, of course not! No, it's-it's wonderful to see you.
h-how much longer you gonna be staying around?
actually, I'm leaving town tomorrow.
Oh. - But...
I was wondering if you might like to grab some dinner later.
if you don't mind consorting with the enemy.
not that we'd be consorting.
whatever consorting actually even means.
well, dinner or consorting... - Dad!
lemon already opened this stupid cake knife and I don't even know what to do. - Magnolia, uh, this is, uh...
there are like 800 gifts left to return before Lemon gets back and if they are still here, - the steam might make her head pop off. - I know, I know. I'll be right there, I promise.
okay.
Emily, I'm so sorry. The timing is just terrible.
um, I'm going to have to pass on dinner. - Of course.
good luck to you, Brick. It was so nice to meet you.
my pleasure.
I know that my jerk neighbor does have feelings for me.
but he shows it by calling me a B-minus in bed.
EW. - I know, it's like not exactly mature.
right? And this other guy? - Mmm.
he left someone at the altar for me.
but I don't even know how it would work between us.
the town already blames me for the breakup, and this guy, he is this town, so, he would never ever leave.
it's kind of an impossible situation. So what should I do?
I think you need to look deep inside your soul and imagine yourself with both guys.
which one would make you happier? - Finally.
you know, someone who understands. - Yeah.
who do you see? - George Tucker.
George, really? - George Tucker.
Hey. - Sorry, didn't realize you'd be with somebody.
I'll just wait, if that's all right.
Hey, Ruby. - Hey, G. T. How you doing?
you know what? I actually better get going, too.
I'm sure I'm way behind on apologizing for Gramps.
no, wait, you can't go. I need you, okay?
could you maybe come over for dinner tonight? I live over at the mayor's. - The mayor's?
well, I'd love to. - Thank you.
good.
Zoe, I just want to say that I'm sorry about this morning.
I was jealous.
and if you choose Wade, then so be it.
it's my fault for waiting to tell you how I really felt about you, but I want you to know something.
lemon and I are over.
for good. For... forever.
you are? - Yes.
are you sure? - Yes.
so choose me.
look, I'm not saying that it's gonna be easy,
I'm not even saying that I know what's gonna happens next, but I do know this...
yesterday, when you told me you were staying in BlueBell...
I suddenly felt the girl of my dreams right there within my reach and I had to reach.
and I did.
and I hurt Lemon and I did things yesterday that I...
I never imagined that I would.
but it was either that or risk spending the rest of my life wondering if I let the woman that I know I am meant to be with slip right through my fingers.
Dr. Hart? - Brick.
I should have known that somehow you would be involved in all this.
hold on, Brick, she didn't have anything to... - And I don't want to hear another word out of you right now, Tucker.
you have a patient.
look, Zoe.
we can deal with all this, I promise you that.
choose me.
lemon Breeland? No. Is that you?
Oh, dear God, no.
ruby Jeffries. I didn't know that you were in town.
how are you? - I'm so fine, fantastic, never been better.
I heard about the breakup. I am so, so sorry.
let me tell you something.
after my divorce, I realized that my marriage had been distracting me from all of my goals.
and now, I can actually focus on what I really want.
now, Lemon, I mean, there had to have been something that you've wanted more in life other than just being a wife.
well...
lemon, you do have a plan B? - Of course.
but, see, I don't stop at B, I have so many plans they just run through the whole alphabet and start over...
AA, BB, like the rows in a movie theater. - So, no plan B, huh?
I am currently looking for a job.
it's all very exciting actually. My plan B is to be a career woman.
what?
I'm sorry. - You did it.
bless your heart.
I've been cursed with blinding ambition since the day I was born.
worked so hard I thought it might kill me.
of course, now I could basically retire to my own private island.
and yet here you are in BlueBell. Lucky us.
but, you...
have you ever even had a job, Lemon?
I have been a Belle and the head of every Junior League committee for the past ten years.
I've had tons of jobs. - It's not a job if they don't pay you, dear.
well, I'm working hard at not slapping you silly right now.
does that count? - Oh, Lemon, don't be so serious.
I only teased you in high school because you were three grades younger and you were too big for your britches and you were named after a fruit.
Oh, but just look at you.
after all these years, you haven't changed a bit.
here.
it's from my cosmetics line.
new makeup makes everybody feel better.
go on.
Ta-ta.
here are your fries.
you know, you should probably cut back on this stuff, Doc.
you don't want to be weighed down when the George scandal breaks and the town's chasing after you with pitchforks.
Wade, stop. - Stop what?
all of it.
the glibness, the sarcasm, anything Wade-like, just stop.
I put myself out there. I told you how I felt about last night.
I know how George feels.
so, for heaven's sake, why don't you just tell me how do you feel?
I feel like we should keep on doing what we did last night.
you know, you could use the practice, and it wasn't so bad for me.
but like I told you before,
I have no interest in going all John Wayne with George Tucker to be your boyfriend.
enjoy your fries.
Oh, Lemonade, I was getting worried about you.
now I hate to bother you with this, but we cannot find the box for this cake knife that Shula Whitaker brought over.
are you okay?
of course I'm not okay.
and it's your fault. Not George's?
I mean, somehow I figured maybe it was just George's fault.
it's your fault that I don't have a Plan B.
I mean, why didn't you ever encourage me to be something other than a wife?
I mean, why didn't you encourage me to be...
I don't know, a doctor like yourself? Oh, you want to be a doctor?
you are afraid of bodily fluids. I am 30 years old.
and I've never even lived on my own. yes
I went from this house to my sorority house, then back to this house.
and, now, thanks to you, I don't have a job, which means I can't afford my own apartment, which means I'm going to live here until the day that I die?
which for the both of us, I hope comes soon!
lemon, calm down. Look, let me get you some sweet tea.
I don't want your sweet tea! You know what, Daddy?
I don't want one more second of you coddling me! You know what, I'll return that to Shula.
seems like a mindless, domestic errand. Right up my alley.
Emily, hey. It's Brick.
you know, upon reflection, I do believe my daughter is gonna need some space after all, and-and, you know, I was just wondering maybe, uh, are you still free tonight?
what's all this?
takeout from Fancy's.
could you get me some wine glasses?
what's the occasion?
wait, don't tell me you made your choice already?
Oh, no.
but I finally made a girlfriend, thank God.
and she's coming over, so she will know what I should do.
a girlfriend? Mm-hmm.
ha ha, good for you.
and me. Mostly me.
you can skedaddle. I don't need your advice anymore now that I have Ruby.
she's only in town for a few days, so I need to milk her for all the girl talk I can.
did you say... Hey, Lavon.
I take it you two know each other. Yeah, Lavon and I dated in high school.
Yeah, hey. Hi, Ruby.
no way.
I'm gonna go change this, and then you two are going to tell me all about it.
but super quick because then we're talking all about me.
would you like some wine?
what's up, Tucker?
peace offering?
this is, uh, obviously an awkward situation, but you and I have been buds for a long time, so so I just want to say that no matter who Zoe chooses...
you and I will be solid. Good.
good. I also just wanted to say that, um, actually,
I have real strong feelings for her.
so, I-I'm all in. All right.
so, it's not exactly gonna be the easiest of competitions for you there.
Hey, George. Think you want to come out here.
Oh, good, you're home.
what on earth are you doing? Defending myself.
aren't you here to kill me?
no. You idiot.
I'm here because, um, I can't breathe, and, um, okay, my chest hurts.
and I'm having a heart attack. Okay, come sit down.
here, I'll get my medical bag. Do you want me to call your dad?
no, I do not want you to call my father.
I cannot stand one more minute of that man's coddling.
which is why I'm gonna spend my last moments on this earth with you, my sworn enemy, the woman about to run off with my fiance.
okay, and you're sure that you saw Lemon go into the carriage house?
Yeah, that's a pretty unmistakable silhouette.
I'm sure she just wanted to chat with Zoe about something.
they got a lot to talk about. Got to say, it's pretty interesting.
yeah? George, it's Bill. Listen,
Eugenia Todd tells me she saw Lemon walking through town, holding a knife.
a knife? So, you might want to be on the lookout, just in case she's not going to slice a cake and you're her target.
right, um, Sheriff, you know what?
you might just want to come on down to the mayor's plantation because Lemon and her knife are at Zoe Hart's place.
Thanks.
Whoo. Man.
things are getting more interesting by the minute.
you look wonderful. Success suits you.
likewise.
done really nice for yourself, too.
I mean, who would have thought Lavon Hayes would move back to town, much less become the mayor. Life can take some unexpected turns.
I mean, in high school, we both just wanted to get up out of here.
and here we are. To unexpected turns.
come on.
unexpected turns.
we had a pretty great run there for a while, didn't we?
we sure did. Yeah.
all that entire summer before you left for 'Bama.
was magical.
it was. I remember the last day we spent together like it was yesterday.
so do I. We, uh, we drove to Gulf Shores, watched the sun come up.
and you kissed me and told me we'd be together forever and that you'd call me as soon as you got settled into your dorm.
must have been so hard for you, being away from home for the very first time with absolutely no telephone access.
um... I'm sorry.
Yeah, I got busy, you know, with football.
Yeah, I waited for you for months.
no one would even date me in my senior class 'cause everybody knew I was Lavon Hayes' girl.
but I wasn't, was I? You had moved on.
you just couldn't handle a difficult conversation. Where is Zoe?
how long does it take to change a shirt?
you know, I should go check on her. Yeah.
I'll be back in a bit. Seriously?
just tell Zoe I'll call her later.
okay.
I'm not waiting any longer. I'm going in. Oh, there's a plan.
Yeah, I'm sure the girl with the knife would love to talk with the guy who pushed her over the edge.
Hey, you guys seen Zoe? She said she was gonna change her shirt.
she never came back. She's entertaining.
lemon... who has a knife.
a what now? yes
I'm going over there. You are not. You are the last person Lemon needs to be seeing right now.
what does Lavon have to do with all this?
Interestinger and interestinger.
it's not a heart attack. Take the Valium.
no. I'm not having a panic attack.
it-it is my heart. All right, it must be a latent condition.
you are a terrible doctor. I'm telling you, Lemon, your vitals are stable.
you are a healthy, 30-year-old woman with no history of heart disease.
given everything that's been going on, a panic attack isn't exactly a surprise.
you ruined my life, so don't you dare feel sorry for me. I don't.
because you are just having a run-of-the-mill panic attack.
take the Valium. No.
if I'm having a panic attack, that just means I'm the fragile mess that everybody thinks that I am, and I'm not a mess.
lemon, take the pill. I promise, it will make you feel better.
no one will ever know.
Oh, thank goodness. Sheriff Bill, all right.
don't worry, guys. You're in good hands.
now, the most important thing is that we keep the situation contained.
no one panic.
web search: kidnapping with a lethal weapon.
searching the Web for...
kidnapping with a lethal weapon.
I'm glad you could come out tonight.
it is good to get out. It's been a while for me.
but delightful dinner companions don't come along all that often.
Dr. Breeland? I spent a lot...
Dr. Breeland?
you know, Tom Long, this better be serious like the sudden onset of a flesh-eating virus or something.
the sheriff's looking for you.
lemon took Zoe hostage.
this'll just take one minute, maybe two.
uh, be right back.
did y'all hear that? It's BlueBell's first ever hostage crisis.
attention, Blawkerites, the whole town is gathered outside Zoe Hart's house in what has become BlueBell's first hostage crisis.
I just called Lemon to ask for her list of demands.
she's not answering. No worries. I got this.
sometimes you just got to ask yourself, "What would John McClane do?
where is that air vent? Hey, hey, where you going?
in. I'm worried.
look, I told you, you're only gonna make it worse, all right?
I'll go in. No.
you're not gonna go in there. This is my problem.
see, it's your fault, not your problem. I'm going.
Hey, Wade, hey, don't you dare.
George, we don't have 15 years for you to make your move, all right, it's not what they need.
Yeah, and I'm sure you know exactly what the two of them need right now. Trust me, brother,
I know exactly what they need, or at least, that's one of them told me the other night right after round three, so...
well, your pulse is back to normal. The panic attack is over.
great.
I can go on living my stupid, miserable life.
come on, Lemon.
you may be a snobby New Yorker with horrible fashion sense, but...
I mean, at least you have a career.
I've been with George Tucker for 15 years of my life, and I don't even know who I am without him.
never been single. Never been on my own.
I'm as much a mess as they think I am.
lemon, I may have a career, but believe me, my life is just as much a mess as yours.
the whole town thinks I'm a home wrecker.
I only have one friend, and did I mention that I had sex with Wade last night?
no.
did you just bite me?
we're both going through major life changes right now.
you maybe a little more than me.
and that panic attack was your body telling you that today might not be the best day for big changes.
we need to take our time.
baby steps.
sometimes, it's about baby steps.
baby steps. I'll walk you out.
this is so confusing. Why are these two fighting? Okay, I have a new theory.
lemon slept with Wade, and George, seeking revenge, slept with... Come on. Knock it off.
knock it off. This is not helping matters. Well, he started it!
no, I finished it.
Hey, hey, hey. There they are!
Oh, my God, they know! Everybody knows.
we don't know what they know.
lemon Breeland, you are under arrest for kidnapping Dr. Hart with a deadly weapon.
okay. So they know that. Come out with your hands up!
sheriff Bill, this has been a big misunderstanding.
lemon didn't kidnap me. We were just hanging out.
it's a kind of new thing, we're pals.
but Le... But Lemon's got a knife.
a wedding present I was all set to return to Shula Whitaker.
and here she is, weirdly. Oh, man.
I was finally going to solve a real crime.
all right. Go on back home, everybody.
go on back home. But now, now, now, Sheriff, we need some answers.
now, if Lemon did not try to kill Zoe because she had an affair with George Tucker, then why, why did George and Lemon break up?
was it Wade? No. It was actually all my...
it was no one's...
it was no one's fault.
there was no one person responsible for the breakup.
at the end of the day, it just...
wasn't meant to be.
all right, you two, shake and make up.
come on, now.
good.
thank you. For saving my life.
I mean, I still hate you, and I'll hate you until your dying day, but... listen, if you want to date George Tucker, then you don't have to hide it from me.
I mean, don't consider this a blessing, it's just that...
I have been through the worst public humiliation twice in two days.
there is nothing that you, or George, or anyone can do that will break me.
are you okay?
it has been a doozy of a night.
but I'm okay. I'm relieved, actually.
because I finally know what I'm going to do.
thanks for meeting me here.
well, then, I take it you made your choice.
George, I'm sorry.
you are picking Wade. No.
no, Wade... just helped me get through your wedding day.
apparently, that's it. I'm choosing no one.
Why? Because, George, as much as I would love to ride off into the sunset with you, right now it's a recipe for disaster. Look, Zoe...
I told you, I will never hurt you again. Maybe not intentionally.
but you just got out of a 15-year relationship.
that's half your life.
you don't know who you are without Lemon.
but I know how I feel about you, and I know that we can make this work.
I've never been in a real relationship.
you've never even dated.
I'm thinking that you... you probably should.
George, I can't be your rebound.
all right, so...
so you're asking me to...
date other people?
as crazy as that sounds, yeah.
one day soon, the stars will align, and you will be single, and healed, and so will I.
but what if it doesn't work like that? We have to hope that it will.
good morning wede
morning, sugar.
you didn't come home last night.
I stayed at AnnaBeth's. She doesn't coddle me.
well, unless I tell her to. I see.
how are you?
determined.
to get a job, to get out of your house, to move on with my life.
well, I would love to help. In any way I can.
thank you. But you've done enough.
lemon... You don't... Daddy...
I love you.
and I have to get out from under your wings, otherwise I'm just gonna suffocate in there.
so, please...
let me.
you know, Lemon...
there's a job opening here, you want it.
lemon Breeland is not waitress material.
no. No, she is not.
but I reckon we'd be willing to give you a shot anyway.
lemon, it's a job. All right? It's dirty, you got to take crap from people all day long, but it's honest work.
and what better way to show the town of BlueBell that you are willing to do whatever it takes to start over?
besides...
it would give me such pleasure to boss you around for once.
may I take your request?
order.
Yeah. Well, we'll see about that.
that's my girl.
Hey, Ruby. There you are. Hey.
uh... you mind?
sure.
look, Ruby, um...
you know, in high school, you had me wrapped around your little finger.
I mean, I was powerless around you.
so I thought if I ever tried to break up with you, well, somehow you'd just talk me out of it.
it was easier to avoid the subject.
and avoid you.
but yeah, that was an immature, cowardly move and I apologize.
apology accepted.
thank you.
well, then, uh...
can I buy you one drink, before you disappear for another decade or two?
well, Lavon, you'll actually have plenty of opportunities to buy me drinks.
I've decided to stick around for a while.
you... you staying? Yeah.
Ah... Why? 'Cause I have a lot of time on my hands, and nothing would give me more pleasure than to mess with your mind.
kidding.
my grandmama wants me to stay and help her out for a while.
that's all.
Bye.
thought you would've ridden off into the sunset by now.
it's not going to work out with George.
for now. I get it. Why settle for the four-cylinder when you've just ridden a V8?
right? I just hope I haven't ruined you for all men. I chose nobody, you ass.
my hat wasn't even in the ring.
although... I suppose my pants could be.
you've got to be kidding. No way.
look, I just figure, you know, you're single. You could take me up on that tutorial.
maybe get your grade up from the B-minus. I don't need a tutorial.
sure. I know what you're doing.
but I am a strong and confident woman, Wade.
and I know that, from the fact that I have had sex with no less than four other men...
none of whom complained... that I am great in bed.
great! Just like I am at everything else I do! I don't have anything to prove to you.
you got that?
this doesn't mean anything. You get that?
I don't like you.
Yeah, see, uh...
I don't really care.
just admit that I'm not a B-minus.
no...
but I do know how you could make up a little extra credit.
stop talking.
those feelings I had for Lavon, I still have them.
something already happened between you two, hasn't it?
Yes. You were the only person who knew how I really felt, and I don't think that I can ever look at you the same way again.
I'm sorry, Lavon, but whatever this is, it has to end until I can win back Lemon's trust.
I'm just trying to spend some quality time with you.
there's nothing wrong when people appreciate your work.
it's called career satisfaction and you would understand that if you... That came out wrong.
plans for your bar? I think I might be ready to give it another shot.
Yeah.
you know, as your doctor,
I'd have to say that is not the safest way to travel.
but as your girlfriend, guitarist in the back of a truck, totally sexy.
well, we were rehearsing in Meatball's garage last night till Meatball Sr. kicked us out.
spent the rest of the night jamming on the open road.
what? Bam.
nice, and when were you planning on sleeping?
two days from now when we win the Battle of the Bands in Fairhope.
we'll sleep the sleep of dudes who are $20, 000 richer.
Yeah, we will.
when you open your bar, I get a drink named after me.
the Meatball.
Yeah. Yeah, I could do that. All right, buddy, it's yours. Take it easy, pal.
come here, beautiful.
Oh, my goodness.
earth to AnnaBeth. I'm so sorry.
it's okay. I, uh...
okay, well, it's unavoidable.
I kind of have to ask about the tuxe do.
Oh, yeah, it-it's for a wedding.
huh? Oh, not mine.
obviously. I am officiating.
just one of my many mayoral duties.
that's sweet. Uh, who's the lucky couple?
couples, actually.
overseas, in the Marine Corp.
see, I-I do proxy weddings.
two people here in BlueBell stand in for a bride and groom overseas, so they can be married legally.
wow, that is so romantic.
well, you know, not for me.
you know, I-I think I'm done in the romance department for a while.
so, you don't have to worry about Lavon Hayes trying to win you back.
Walt, you are such a hoot.
Oh, you are sweet. And beautiful.
and you are so good at giving a compliment that I was thinking that maybe you could spend the weekend with me here.
my daddy's out with his teenager and Magnolia's on a field trip.
Oh, I wish I could, Lemon, but I've spent every night with you for the past two weeks.
and this weekend is my college roommate's bachelor party.
Oh, well, you can't miss that.
Hi, Walt. Hi, Lemon.
Oh, don't you look luminous.
we missed you at the last two Belle meetings.
there was a mere crisis involving discretionary snack cakes at the preservation committee. AnnaBeth totally took care of it.
she filled in for you.
Yes, well, she's been doing a lot of that lately.
enjoy the coffees.
looks like your friends miss you, too.
come on, you shouldn't be alone. Have a girls' weekend while I'm with the guys.
you know what, you're so right.
the stare, the icy cold tone of voice.
I'd know Lemon's wrath anywhere.
what did you do? Something stupid.
I thought it'd blow over by now.
so, we keep running into her and being nice until it does.
sooner or later, someone else will offend her even worse and she'll forget all about it.
I would love to, but she's avoiding me. Well, she can't do that forever.
Yeah, I know. In a town this size...
no, I mean really. She can't do that forever.
look.
this tracks Lemon's location by her cell phone signal.
those fe this up when I got lost bringing her iced tea during that Civil War reenactment.
accidently run into her. Those fe this up when I got lost.
and make her see just exactly what she's been missing.
meatball's lyrics may seem simple at first, but like an onion, they're many layered underneath.
Oh, yeah. Well, what have we here?
what? I'm a groupie now.
wow, well, I hope y'all are going to come to the band practice later.
Duh. Um, yeah.
why not? Yeah. Yeah.
awesome. All right, I'll see you later.
what is going on with you?
I feel like I'm cheating on my boyfriend with a super hot musician that looks just like him.
she's not my favorite person or my second or third, she's really right near the bottom of my list
but I almost feel bad for Zoe right now.
musicians are like, the sexiest drug in the world.
well, you know that your-your current boyfriend has some musical chops of his own.
Oh, I know.
I saw the photo of you in your high school production of South Pacific.
no, no, I happen to have played with Wade at BlueBellapalooza.
undergarments were thrown in my direction.
sweetie, you don't have to try to impress me.
I now find lawyers equally as sexy. I'll see you tonight.
uh... okay. Okay, yeah, okay.
Oh, Daddy, it was no problem. Everybody else was busy doing other things, so I had time to stop by and check on the house, so...
sure, yeah, um, okay, yeah, you can-you can call me back after your dinner with Shelby. I'll just be here...by myself.
okay.
who's there?
you scared me half to death.
magnolia, what happened to your choral group trip to Jackson?
Oh, well, you know how teacher's always bluff that they'll turn the bus around if some idiot doesn't stop fooling around?
wasn't bluffing this time. Yay, this is fantastic.
you're not even going to ask if I was the idiot?
no.
we are going to have a sister weekend.
are you ready for 48 hours of inseparable fun?
sorry, I'm late.
sergeant Jeffries' elbow was acting up again. What'd I miss you?
just you wait.
am I wrong or is this really...
thank you, BlueBell. Yeah, yeah.
Wade, that was-that was so awesome.
man, that was so good. But we do have to go now.
uh, because I promised Tansy that I was gonna fix her shower.
but you, you keep on rocking man.
all right, rock on, buddy.
Yeah. Yeah, buddy.
Hi. Hey, what'd you think?
What'd I tell you, right? We're amazing, aren't we?
I think you're ready for a little "Nightmare Demon Lullaby."
Uh-oh, here it comes.
one, two, three, four.
so, I have gone over it in my head, and our only option is to kidnap Meatball.
keep him somewhere isolated, yet comfortable, until Battle of the Bands is over.
all right, we didn't like it, but Tansy seemed to really love it, so...
okay, Mind Face is never going to win a contest based on the audiences' votes, all right, cause Meatball, his voice, he sounds like a werewolf stuck in a garbage disposal.
and Mind Face， what does-what does that even mean?
does it mean, like, the melding of the brain and the face?
I thought-I though it meant, like, mind the face.
got to watch the face.
mind Face! Mind Face!
no, it is, it's a confounding name. But the point of the matter is, we cannot say anything to Wade.
he's way too excited about this, all right?
for now.
but what happens when he loses, and we didn't do anything to help him?
that is our fault.
our fault? Yes.
no.
Yes. No.
opening that bar is his life dream, okay?
we have to tell him.
listen, Zoe, he's too invested, okay?
you know the man, he is not even going to hear you.
you're right.
that's why it can't come from me.
do you take Matthew by proxy to be your lawfully wedded husband?
I do.
do you take Kimberly by proxy to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I sure do.
now, by the power vested in me,
I pronounce Matthew Scott Jackson and Kimberly Trang Tran husband and wife.
may I now kiss my proxy bride?
you may.
okay, break it up. We all got places to be.
I've got to run, I'm going to be late for work.
Oh, come with me, I'll turn on the siren.
Lavon, that was so romantic. I always knew I wanted to marry Wanda, but looking into her eyes and saying those words made me realize I want to marry her now.
good luck with that, I hope it works out for you.
what? No.
you have to help me plan it. Tom, Wanda loves you.
just get down on one knee and ask her to marry you. One knee won't cut it.
Wanda makes me feel big, epic things.
I know, I'm a Hallmark card, I can't help it.
eh, Wanda does deserve something nice. Which is why I need your help.
your proposal at Christmas was so perfect and detailed and beautiful.
up until the point where she...
well, you know.
uh, please, Lavon, for Wanda... for love.
fine.
Yeah. Okay, I was thinking we could do something with Ewoks and Avatars.
uh, no.
how about this one? Not a chance.
when you said you'd take me shopping,
I thought that we were using the definition of shopping that the rest of the world uses, and that you would buy me something.
well, that's because you only want the dresses that look like they belong on Rihanna's backup dancers.
lemon! How funny seeing you here!
Oh, hey, so Crickett and I were just heading to Susie's for some pedis.
maybe you and Magnolia would like to join us.
it would give us a chance to catch up, really talk.
Nope. Uh, we're nowhere near finished shopping yet.
I am. Oh, really?
I thought you wanted to try this on.
sorry, ladies. Maybe next time.
Hey, babe! Hey, what's up?
I ran into George in town and he has a little problem.
maybe you can help him with it.
it's kind of sensitive, though. Ooh, something sexual?
if it's got to do with Tansy, the best bet: Ace bandages, a lot of ice.
no, no, it's not that.
um, I know that you're all set to have Meatball play with you tomorrow night.
who, by the way, he's a, he's a huge talent.
but I was wondering if you might consider letting me replace him just for one night.
what? Why?
well, because I have been feeling very down lately.
it's just cause I don't have anything artistic in my life right now, you know?
and the last time I felt like I really did was, well, the last time that you and I played together at BlueBellapalooza.
well, I hate to tell you this, George, but I think you're talking to the wrong guy.
you should ask the good Dr. Hart here for a suggestion on a shrink.
I thought the two buddies jamming on stage, there is no better therapy than that.
and you don't have to worry about winning, because you guys? Awesome together.
everyone said so.
hmm. Well, as tempting as this charitable act sounds,
I think I'm going to have to take a rain check on the reunion tour.
Oh. Gotta dance with the girl you brung.
not always you don't. No hard feelings?
no. No, none at all, actually. No.
yeah.and so best of luck tomorrow night.
and, uh, take it easy.
what was that about? Okay, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before, but I was trying to protect your feelings.
and you're not gonna want to hear this, but I don't think Meatball is great.
I think that he stinks, sometimes literally, but mostly vocally.
is that what this whole show is about?
you and Tucker and the "search for an artistic outlet.
man, that was really good. It was very moving. I am trying to help you.
I think that you are making a mistake with Meatball.
you just don't get Meatball's very particular artistic flavor.
Oh, yeah, that's because it sounds like
meatball's got one stuck in his throat!
you who thought Waylon Jennings was a band comprised of brothers named Jennings who liked to wail.
I can't be the only one that ever thought that.
it's not a big deal, all right?
everybody's got their strengths.
it just so happens, you don't know anything about music. It's fine, all right?
that's why I'm the one in the band. No, but I do.
look, don't worry about it, all right?
I'll worry about it. Let me do the worrying.
you want a beer? What you want?
Ooh, bummer.
I'm just finishing off the last of the eggs now, the pancakes and some leftovers, which may or may not have been tuna casserole.
so, I've been doing some thinking, and maybe I was quick to pass judgment and wasn't being supportive enough.
well, that is mighty big of you, Doc.
I think you should call Lily Anne Lonergan and reunite the old band.
after all, I'm the reason that you're not playing with her tonight.
just so I understand this, you want me to fire Meatball and hire Lily Anne, who made a pass at me the last time I saw her? One little pass. You know, it happens.
Seriously? You think Mind Face is that bad?
I just, I think the audience might not hear what you hear.
and the whole point is to win, right? I mean, that's what you really want.
no, what I want, Zoe, is a girlfriend who's supportive of me.
and that means saying you like my band even though clearly you don't!
wait.
what's up? I got your message.
I got your proposal for you.
I knew you'd do it! So, what is it?
picture this. I tell Wanda you're in the town square where you're standing next to a horse-drawn carriage.
you tell her that your love for her is timeless, and that you would be honored to have her hand in marriage.
there's only one problem with that.
I'm afraid of horses. Like, very afraid.
so? You're not gonna be riding them, you're gonna be driving them, like a car.
Yeah, yeah, like a car with four legs. Yeah.
and beady eyes that ravage your soul.
look, what better way to show your commitment than to stare fear straight in the face?
love is risky, Tom.
but the risk is worth it. Beady eyes and all.
I thought we put these boots back.
I had her ring them up when you weren't looking.
well, I guess there's a fine line between deceit and initiative.
Hey, you know what best friends do? They go to concerts.
and I heard that Wade Kinsella's performing at the Battle of the Bands tonight. Can we go?
I don't think so.
then, no offense, I just think sisters' weekend might have to be over for tonigon.
Tina's having friends over, and I'll just... But, um, there's still so much fun to be had.
I was thinking that we could get our hair done.
can I get purple streaks in my hair?
um, I guess so. And you can do yours, too.
purple streaks?
Whoo! I put a little extra sauce on that last one.
What'd you think? Yeah, yeah, it was okay.
uh, you know, maybe we could make a few adjustments, though, huh?
what kind of adjustments?
well, I just think on a couple songs, maybe, you know, we could do something a bit different.
like more hardcore? More death metal?
I was thinking maybe like more, um...
uh... regular.
what are you talking about?
we invented the Growl Country style together.
it's our signature. Yeah, but we got a three-song set, so maybe, we can, you know, play one cover.
there's no way in hell that I, Meatball Reuther, will ever sing a cover.
that's my face up there. Yeah, but it's my band, Meatball.
you wouldn't be here singing if I didn't call you last week...
and maybe now I wish you hadn't. 'Cause clearly I'm holding you back.
well, let me cut you free of your chains. I quit.
have fun, Wade Kin-sell out.
enjoy the high school reunion circuit.
Hello?
Walt, what happened to your bachelor party?
well... Kyle was a little bit more straightlaced than I remember.
it was a daytime thing. And co-ed.
plus you seemed a touch disappointed when I left, so...
Oh, no. ...figured I'd come find you.
look at you. You look great.
is your hair purple? Oh, yeah. I was just having a little sister time.
you remember Magnolia. Hey.
Hey, if you guys already got plans, then...
Oh, no, no, no. I'll just go change, and we can go for a walk and all head out to dinner.
what do you say, Magnolia? Actually, you guys go.
I could really use the time and do my homework instead.
your homework? I'm 15. I do have homework.
go! It's fine.
they sound great, don't they?
how'd you pull that off?
Wade called me out of the blue. Nice.
Hey, hey. See what I mean? Legitimate rocker cred.
and you did not like it?
no, you sounded fantastic.
but...?
but when I got my life back on track, I gave myself a policy:
no more dating musicians. I'm not a musician.
I'm a lawyer. I got a real job.
so were all my other musicians. They had day jobs, too, okay?
it's a rule, George Tucker, and I live by it.
Hey! Here.
what happened? Last-minute change of plans?
Where's Meatball? Creative differences.
Yeah, Meatball decided he didn't want to sell out, so...
well, that is his loss because you guys sounded incredible amazing.
Wade, I think that you might win.
well, I'd love to sit around and soak up all the support, but me and the band have a bunch more covers to practice for tonight, so...
so, how's the chicken?
I mean, this is the only civilized restaurant in town, but Delma does overcook.
don't you worry. It's perfect. Good.
lemon! What are the odds of running into you like this twice in two days?
I wouldn't know, I don't like to gamble.
what happened to your hair? I think it looks sensational.
well, this is courtesy of Magnolia.
she and I have been having such fun together.
speaking of new looks, Crickett's thinking of redoing her kitchen.
I was thinking of going modern, you know, like gray walls and stainless steel appliances.
gray walls?
like a submarine.
or a fallout shelter.
maybe you could take a look at my tile samples?
no, thank you.
as you can see, I'm on a romantic date with Walt.
okay.
we'll be over there in case you change your mind.
I cannot believe that didn't work.
are you sure? Because we can join your friends.
I don't mind. I am sure.
all I need is you.
I mean, who cares about Crickett's kitchen?
I mean, you and I have so much more in common than I do with them anyways.
like our mutual affection for old movies.
in fact, Philadelphia Story's playing in Mobile.
we should go. Yeah, that sounds fine.
tomorrow then. Oh, and then the next day is Doctor Zhivago.
Ah... uh, sure, yeah, I guess so.
great. And Friday maybe we could go the theater.
uh, Dash is doing his own stage version of Funny Girl.
and next Christmas, maybe we should go on a theater-themed cruise.
you say, next Christmas?
is everything set?
all right, great. I'm gonna make sure Wanda arrives in exactly 20 minutes.
I just heard Babs Foster telling Mrs. Mayfair that Tom's in town square setting up what looks like a marriage proposal.
Oh no . I know
can you believe it? This is a disaster.
sign this set list.
it'll be worth a small fortune someday on that Antique Roadshow program.
you guys sound real good, Wade. That prize money's in the bag.
don't tell Uncle Wally, but I'd love to be the first employee at your new bar.
Yeah, well, lot of great bands competing tonight, Wanda.
you know, nothing's a sure thing.
except death and taxes.
Hey, Tansy.
you're really doing this?
Yeah, yeah, Wade needs my help.
plus I think it's gonna be pretty fun.
but I told you, I... Tansy.
look, I was with a woman for 15 years who tried to choose my socks and tie combination every single day.
okay, I-I can't be with somebody anymore who dictates what I can and cannot do.
so if you want to show up tonight and support me, that would be great.
but I am going to battle with my band.
my... I'm Tom.
and you are Mrs. Sprinkles.
Mr. Sprinkles, Mr. Sprinkles, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't know, I didn't know.
I had no idea. Tom!
wait, what...?
no, no, you're too early. I'm still just trying to get to know Mr. and Mrs. Sprinkles.
that's the horses-- I'm not ready for Wanda right now.
no, it's okay, Tom.
uh, well, actually it's not okay...
it... Wanda's not coming.
so you can stop with the horses. What?
why-why wouldn't she be coming... Is she sick?
or paralyzed from the neck down? No, no, no.
she's fine. Well, Levon, if something's wrong, you got to tell me.
I overheard Wanda talking to Wally. She-she doesn't want you to propose.
what... But that-that doesn't make sense beca...
because Wanda would never say something like that... that... I don't believe it. It's not possible!
whoa, whoa, whoa.
help, help!
help!
please!
mag, you won't believe what just happened...
got your text.
got about five minutes before George and I go play some real life Rock Band, so what's up?
let me start by saying that I am really sorry.
I never should've butted-in in the first place.
I screwed up trying to interfere with the way that you were doing things.
but... I need you to know that I support you for you.
reaching for your dream.
Ta-da!
thank you.
I know that you will win tonight.
cause I believe in you.
it's... it's amazing.
Lavon, I'm in the middle of something, I can't...
Oh, my God.
I'll be right there.
look, Tom Long got into it with some horses...
I'll see you at the battle, okay?
all right.
Hey, great to see you, handsome. I can't wait to see you kill it up there.
Yeah, thanks.
good luck.
Hey, look, the sellout.
I'm really gonna enjoy booing you and your pal Glee Club up there.
Hey, Tucker?
I was thinking maybe we should do "Ring of Fire" first instead.
or I guess we could scratch that and we could do, uh, "Ramblin' Man.
I mean, we killed that one once before, right? All right, man, look.
everything's gonna be fine, all right? Let's just play what we practiced, all right?
and maybe put down the drink 'cause we still got six bands to go, all right?
just try to relax, Wade.
you relax, man.
this is too important.
give it up for Logan Mize.
but you already let my friends in. Please, I forgot my I. D.
just look at me. Do I look like a teenager to you?
put your eyes back in your head before I call the cops. This girl is 15.
this was totally about to work. You are in so much trouble.
why are you talking to me like a mom? I thought we were best friends now.
Yeah, well, best friends don't break curfew and sneak out to bars the minute they let their guard down.
now get into the car!
lemon, what a coincidence.
why do you two keep showing up?
for the love of God, you're using that app, aren't you?
app? What app? I-I don't have an app.
I can't believe that you would stoop so low.
lemon, how long are you gonna be mad at me about this?
I don't know. But no amount of carefully constructed run-ins is gonna change the fact that you betrayed me. I have apologized again and again.
what more do you want?
we live in the same town.
we share a business.
well...
I don't think that we should anymore.
I want to dissolve AnnaBeth's.
I can't believe it.
well, nothing's broken, just a mild whiplash.
no, no, I mean Wanda.
I can't believe she doesn't want me to propose. I know how she feels about me.
well, you think you do, and then...
look, you may not believe me, but there is a silver lining here.
Oh, and what is that?
that you didn't have to go through with the proposal, make a fool out of yourself. Hello?
is Tom Long in here? Tom!
there you are. We've been looking for you everywhere.
now there's an emergency in town square and you got to come quick.
Tom is not going anywhere quick. He should be resting.
sorry, Dr. Hart, it's my duty. I'm a trained first responder.
are you seeing what I'm seeing?
the undead descending upon BlueBell?
Frank was right. The zombie apocalypse is upon us.
there are so many levels of weird going on right now.
islands in the Stream.
wait a minute, those zombies are singing my favorite song.
I heard you didn't want me to propose.
you said it would be a disaster.
that's just because the costumes and makeup took forever to do.
so, you don't want to break up?
break up?
how could I ever?
...will you marry me?
only if you'll marry me.
I can't believe I almost ruined that.
I don't think anyone could have ruined that.
Oh! I gotta go!
I gotta go to Battle of the Bands.
o-okay. I'll see you.
all right. Bye.
Hey. What are you doing down there?
I'm just stayin' hydrated, my friend.
all right. Yeah. Very funny.
very funny. Come on, Wade.
get up. Get up. Get up. Sit down right here.
okay. I'm gonna get you some coffee and you're gonna chug it, all right?
we're up next, so... Hey. Hey.
it's only a couple of songs, Wade.
all right? You could do this in your sleep.
it's easy, man. Yeah.
everything comes so easy to Goldenboy George.
we lose, it's just a teeny little bump in the otherwise well-paved road of your life. Okay, you lose, it's just have no ideay little bump what you're talking about, Wade.
I busted my ass to get to where I am.
I made my own success. You want yours?
then man up for once, and go work for it.
see, I got things at stake, here. Yeah, I know how much you want that bar.
no, it's not just about the bar, George.
I could lose... everything.
and now, give it up for Mind Face!
Wade, I promise you, we are gonna be great.
okay? So let's... let's just put the drink down...
george isn't just a lawyer and a damn fine singer, he's also the alcohol police.
well, I don't need you judging me, Mr. Tucker.
hmm. And I also don't need you in my band.
you're fired.
Hi. You still remember the set list?
are you kidding me? Hell yeah!
come on.
and the winner of tonight's Battle of the Bands and the $20, 000 is Logan Mize!
Oh, man! This thing is rigged.
Oh. Well, well, well.
look who showed up. I decided I couldn't miss the chance to come support my amazingly talented singin' lawyer.
even if he didn't get a chance to show his stuff.
yeah? And what about your, uh... your rule?
I guess you're the exception.
I made the rule so that I didn't fall back into old patterns.
musicians are my Achilles' heel.
the hours, the groupies...
none of it helped with my trust issues.
to me in the first place.
you totally should've won.
better get comfy, cause you're not leaving here for the rest of the weekend.
one little adventure, and you turn into a prison warden.
Yep, you can consider this Alcatraz.
I don't know who you are anymore.
one minute you want to be my best friend, and then you drop me like a hot potato for your boyfriend. You know what, you're not the only one who got dropped tonight, okay?
so just get over it.
what?
I'm sorry.
Walt broke up with me.
the dentist dumped you? Why?
I guess I scared him off.
for the same reason that I let you buy that ridiculous tiny dress.
I was just trying so hard not to be lonely.
you?
lonely?
you've never been alone your whole life.
Yeah, well... maybe that's the problem.
Annabeth and I had a falling-out.
and I've just been so desperately trying to replace her with either you or with Walt...
that I just let you take advantage of me.
I'm 15.
I'll take advantage of anyone who'll let me.
well, I'm not gonna let it happen again, okay?
sweetheart, I can't be your best friend.
because you still need a big sister.
I do.
but I didn't mind having you as a best friend, either.
come here.
Hey, Wade.
you can save your closing argument, Mr. Attorney.
verdict's in.
okay.
look, man, I just...
I just want to know what the hell's going on with you.
look, it's none of your business, all right?
I just want to be left alone.
okay.
okay, so you lost.
it happens.
Hey, look... you're going to have plenty of other chances, all right?
th-there's plenty of other ways that you can... you can raise money for your bar.
you mean plenty of ways to fail.
so that's it. That's that, we're just...
we're just gonna quit.
you know something, George, I'm...
I'm sick of people thinking I can do better, be better than who I am.
they're always gonna get let down.
no, they're not. That's not true.
and- and you know it, Wade.
see? There you go. Believin' in me again.
save your money, Tucker, I ain't worth it.
: now, if you don't mind...
I'm gonna get back to being me.
Wade, come on.
Hey, Wade.
Lavon, what are you... No, I know I said.
I was done in the romance department, but these last few days I've helped couples find each other in war zones and...among the undead.
but it made me realize that...
this is worth fighting for.
now, I-I know you got your girl code, but...
...I will wait.
that's all.
you would not believe the night I've had.
I got so lost. This place is not easy to find-- maybe that's why they call it Tricky Rick's.
I can't believe that I missed the whole thing. What happened?
how'd you guys do?
um... Wade kicked George out of the band and went on with Meatball.
What?!
Oh, no! So he lost? - Yeah.
big-time.
Oh, crap! Well, that explains why he isn't answering his phone.
well, is he okay? Where is he? Uh, you know, I-I think that he...
um... I think he left.
Mm. It was just... it was a really rough night for him, so...
he must be furious at me.
why don't you follow us home. That way you won't get lost.
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. That's... Yeah, okay.
the Rammer Jammer will turn into some horrible chain restaurant.
unless we were to pool the money.
you mean together? Lord have mercy.
some things that you left at my place. This doesn't mean that I forgive you.
see you around.
are you okay? The MRI was totally clear.
I saw you looking at Lavon and Ruby.
I've been keeping you from him. Go fight for your man.
before you make any decisions, I'm throwing my hat in the ring, too.
yours is the only hat in the ring, AnnaBeth. Ruby left.
I told her I have feelings for someone else.
part of me couldn't stand Jonah being with you.
because? Because he doesn't appreciate you, Zoe.
he's not going to see how special you are.
mayor Hayes. - Yeah?
now, this is the second Sunday that the people of this town had to line up like Soviets for post-church pastries.
we need our eggs, we need our bacon. We need our grits.
now, now, Lemon and Wade are filling out the final paperwork right now.
the Rammer Jammer will be open in a couple days.
Wade Kinsella and Lemon Breeland owning a business together?
better get used to living on muffins.
Wade and Lemon are BlueBellians, and we will support them.
but, you know, maybe we should all practice cooking our own breakfast, just in case.
man, we are going to be huge.
I cannot believe that this is actually happening. And I agree: huge.
and who cares that everybody thinks we're going to crash and burn, right?
they do? Uh, yeah.
Oh, I guess people are more forthcoming with you.
but, for now, the important thing is we give our customers and staff the confidence that nothing is going to change for the worse. Exactly.
all right. Well...
here we are. Uh, that's the wrong key.
I assure you, it's not. Yeah, that one's brass; the right one's silver.
no worries - I got mine. Just give me a chance to fiddle with it.
well, why would I, when I happen to know that this is the key that opens the door?
because you take the moment from me. That's pretty cute.
you know, if you just let me... No, just let me just get...
this is ridiculous.
what do you mean, you're not selling the Sunday New York Times anymore?
that is the one thing I actually enjoy buying at this store.
George, Frank is not selling the paper anymore.
our paper. Frank, we need the New York Times, all right?
I - I wait all week to read that thing.
the - the magazine and the Week in Review.
Sunday nights, I need to unwind with my crossword puzzle. Crossword puzzle.
thank you. Oh, yeah, yeah, right.
as much as I am devastated, inwardly, by the loss of your puzzle, I can't do it.
you two are the only people in this town that even purchase that liberal gossip rag, but the distributor makes me order eight issues.
I end up throwing out six papers every week. Okay, Frank, how about this?
I will buy the other six papers every week.
and I'll-I'll just give them away to the schools or something.
all right, you got a deal. You are my hero.
enough of that.
just a couple of papers. Thank you.
Bye. Yeah.
so, we should make sure to get to the Rammer Jammer day after tomorrow so that we can show our support to Lemon and Wade.
Yes.
right.
you okay?
Yes.
you sure?
Yes. Okay.
cause you would tell me if something was...
what is going on with you and Zoe Hart? What are you talking about?
I bit my tongue when you did everything in your power to stop Zoe from having sex with Jonah Breeland during spring break, but I just saw you promise to buy six extra newspapers just so Dr. Hart could pretend she's in New York City.
where she actually could be with a couple of clicks on the Internet.
I'll send her some links.
tansy, I would have bought all eight papers to continue getting them delivered for myself.
this had nothing to do with Zoe Hart.
and, yes, I did not want her to have sex with Jonah Breeland because she is my friend and he is a giant ass with a stethoscope.
but that's all. Baby, you're - you're my girl.
okay?
I only have eyes for you.
good, 'cause I'm kind of getting used to you.
I'm kind of getting used to you, too.
well, now, here they are.
my two favorite lovebirds. Guess what.
I have the perfect parts for you two in my big Shakespeare night.
Shakespeare night? It's a review of Shakespeare's most iconic scenes.
right. How could we miss a Shakespeare night?
Yay. All right, then.
Hey, Big Z, I need some advice. Hit me.
well, AB signed us up to do a scene in Dash's Shakespeare thing. Uh-huh.
how do I get out of it?
you want my advice? Yeah.
suck it up and do it. For the school gym, for AnnaBeth.
I've been giving you relationship advice forever.
now that I'm in need, "suck it up and do it" is the best you can offer?
well, boo, Zoe Hart, boo. Oh, you want better advice, ask Brick.
it's shrink week, and suddenly, he is our town Freud.
you know, when your father Harley started Mental Health Week, I, too, was skeptical, but stress can impair the immune system.
and a week of free counseling has proved very beneficial for this town's physical health.
Oh, and, Lavon, Hmm?
it'd be great if you would stop in and show your support as mayor.
well... you're right. Great. I'll-I'll come by tomorrow.
why do you get to do all the counseling? I did a psych rotation at Bellevue.
well, that's because people don't want advice from a crazy person. What, me?
Lavon, stick up for me.
well...
as a matter of fact, you should come see me tomorrow.
I will reserve the 9: 00 a. m. spot especially for you.
it just so happens that I have had years of therapy with the best analysts in New York City.
I am the picture of mental health.
you can stuff it. Both of you.
the staff meeting was supposed to start 15 minutes ago.
are people usually this late? Well, I am.
I apologize for my tardiness. I stopped to get a coffee at the Butter Stick.
it was a madhouse. Well, where is everyone?
Oh, well, to answer your question, in the restaurant industry, there's a lot of turnover
and when the employees found out that you were the new management, they, um, turned over.
come... come on. All of them?
well, at least you're here.
have a seat.
yeah...
I just came by to give you my notice.
Tom's mother got us a bee colony as a wedding gift, and, well, honey's really popular right now, so it's a great business opportunity.
so Tom's taking a job at the Dixie Stop so I can be a stay-at-home bee mom.
it's so exciting.
I regret to inform you.
I'm sorry.
so, we open in two days and we have no employees.
well, on the bright side, we have 48 hours to find better, more enthusiastic ones.
George? It's so late. What are you doing here?
brought you the Times.
what? Yeah.
the Times? Where did you get it?
drove to Birmingham. Really?
that's, like, six hours. Why on earth would you do that?
Zoe, don't you know?
I would do anything for you.
you are everything to me.
you always have been.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Dr. Breeland, this is Dr. Hart.
I'm going to need that 9: 00 a. m. slot after all.
well, good morning, Dr. Hart. How are we?
look, obviously, I am not about to let you butt into my personal life.
and yet, here you are. Yes.
but I will be speaking in hypotheticals. Okay.
so, what brings you here this morning?
if I had this incredible dream about a certain gentleman that I used to have feelings for but really, really didn't think that I still did, even though there was this hug and he smelled so...
that doesn't definitely, hypothetically mean that those feelings have reemerged, right? No, it doesn't.
especially if you're talking about George Tucker.
no, I'm not. Why? What if I was?
no, I know, it's bad. Crazy. And so embarrassingly repetitive.
a very painful breakup.
and I would suggest that's why George Tucker is appearing in your dreams.
because he is unavailable, and thus, unable to hurt you.
see, he is the man in your dreams, not the man of your dreams.
not bad, Dr. Breeland.
so, George has moved on. You know, he's happy.
so what if he's amazing and wonderful and I probably made a mistake not picking him way back when.
I'm a rational person. I'm a doctor.
I can control my own emotions.
I won't let myself like him. I can just put these feelings out.
just squash them. Way, way down.
push them. Deep, deep, deep into my sub, sub, sub, subconscious.
well, how about, until you have some perspective on your feelings, you just lay off?
avoid intimate situations where you might...
hug? Right, or do or say something crazy.
great idea.
because, when it comes to George, not smart- kind of my M. O.
so I am going to stay in the office all day.
all week - all month if I have to, just to avoid any chance of running into him.
is there any chance you could use some of that office time to-to deal with our unpaid billing?
if I'm being honest, probably not.
Oh, uh, Mayor Hayes, you're early.
that's great, because you can be Dr. Breeland's first patient of the day.
very first.
you okay? You're acting weird.
you're acting weird. Because I'm great. You two have fun.
so, Ms. Curran, you're applying to be the cook? Mm-hmm.
do you have any experience? Not if you mean professionally.
but I watch every food show on TV.
I made all of Paula Deen's recipes for my grandfather.
I put them in the blender since he has no teeth.
but his taste buds are still going strong. Well, I see.
but if I'm gonna work here, I have some demands.
I can only accept this job if this one can avoid hitting on me. Too skinny.
that'll be tough. And you have to install a TV in the kitchen, preferably with Oprah Winfrey Network.
and I take every religious holiday off in every religion.
you have to let me - it's the law.
well, thank you for your time. Are you sure?
there's nothing you want to talk about? Brick, I told you.
I'm only here to show my support.
I just want to read my sports section and pass the time.
Oh, hey, uh, thanks a lot for getting me out of Shakespeare rehearsal today.
interesting. Now, why would you want to avoid rehearsal?
no reason.
you know... Shakespeare- kind of a hack.
Lavon, talk to me.
I'm sorry. Our time is up.
Hey, how'd it go?
you shrunk?
Oh, I'm fine. Buy you some coffee? Oh, I can't.
I got to stay here. Lots of paperwork.
tansy, baby, you got to see a doctor.
I'll see Dr. Breeland.
Dr. Breeland's only doing therapy this week, okay?
you're gonna have to see Dr. Hart. Actually, coffee sounds great.
Yes, it's true. Moi was the silver medalist in the Southern Alabama Roadkill Cooking Contest.
I pride myself on making the inedible in-inedible.
that is impressive. I'm in.
veto, veto. I have veto power.
12 years at Chez Lucille in Mobile, specialize in - how do you say?
"Crowd-pleasers" like boeuf bourguignon, coq au vin, escargot. I'm sorry, uh...
how do you say, uh, veto?
wow, all right. Yum.
veto.
51 years of waitressing experience? My goodness.
veto.
I spent the last two summers working in my Aunty Rae's diner.
obviously, yeah. Mm-hmm. Veto, veto, veto.
I could be a great waitress. Better than you were.
mags, you have to be 19 years old to serve alcohol.
well, you also said I have to be 21 to get into bars, so you don't know everything.
who's next? She was the last person. Sh...
so, we open tomorrow and we have hired no one?
it's your fault! We had several reputable contestants!
of all the crazies who have walked through that door today, Lemon Breeland, you are the craziest.
what's going on with you? We... we've been here for an hour. Don't you have to go back to work?
don't you have to go to Shakespeare rehearsal?
come on, Crickett. You are the understudy for Juliet.
it is only one line. Why can't you learn it?
cause people don't talk like that.
Wh-what's here? A cup, "closed in my true love's hand?
poison, I see... " Something, something.
hath been his timeless end.
o churl! Drunk all, and left no friendly drop.
why, Dr. Zoe Hart, you know the line.
my mother made me go to theater camp one summer.
I was being punished. Oh, my Lord. I have found my Juliet.
who? Me? She'd love to.
as a wise woman once told me, suck it up and do it.
o churl.
Hey. I'm sorry about earlier. Yeah, me, too.
listen, Dash's Shakespeare show is tomorrow, and if we can't host the after-party, then we're just...
sunk for sure.
so... - Bonjour.
what? Have you lost your mind?
someone needs to cook. And Chef Tiberghien has years of experience.
he trained at Le Cordon Bleu.
listen, I am sorry that I went behind your back, but it is clear that one of us just needs to step up and lead.
I agree.
which is why I hired Fanny to be our waitress.
friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
the evil men do lives after them... Frank, Frank, that's fine, but could you do it with a little bit more enthusiasm?
uh, I don't do enthusiasm.
w- Well, pretend that you're killing a small animal.
it was one mouse! Mice carry Lyme disease.
uh, take-take five, Frank.
all right, next up, Romeo and Juliet.
you're Romeo? You're Juliet?
well, I hope you're not sick, George Tucker, because you two have a big old smooch coming your way.
Oh, no.
it's the doctor's office. It's a medical emergency.
I got to run. But you...
Zoe Hart, you cannot kiss George Tucker.
I know! I am lonely and hurting.
if I kiss him, I'm gonna go right back down that rabbit hole again.
so how do I get out of it? Lie.
right.
you are good at this.
the Rammer Jammer is open again.
I am just so happy. Hear, hear.
Ooh. Eggs! Thank you. Bacon.
Grits! Grits!
enjoy.
you must be so cold exposing all that flesh.
you know, they say 70% of the body's heat escapes through the... breast.
Hi, guys. Glad you could make it.
we wouldn't miss the grand reopening. This is very exciting. It...
looks amazing. It looks just like the...
the Rammer Jammer.
Congratulations.
Yeah. Congratulations. Of course we're here.
Thanks. I'm glad you are.
Hey, guys. How is everything? The eggs are fluffy.
and the bacon's sublime. But these grits...
revolting.
uh, look, I'll take care of this, all right?
breakfast is on the house.
hey there, Romeo. Hey. How's Tansy?
uh, she's doing much better. Poor thing still doesn't have a voice, though.
Oh, yeah, you know, that can take a couple of days.
but listen, I-I just... I wanted to talk to you.
I actually had something I wanted to talk to you about as well.
Oh. Um, no offense, but...
tansy is a little bit sensitive when it comes to you, and I don't want to make her jealous, so I don't think that doing this scene together is a good idea.
Oh. You are right.
cause I really wouldn't want to upset Tansy.
Oh. Well, great. Well, thank you for being so understanding.
and now we just have to...
think of a plan to present to Dash.
okay, so, about this Shakespeare show...
Oh, I wanted to thank you again for doing it with me.
Jake's idea of theater was watching the cars go through the big spinny brushes at the car wash.
honestly, it's like a dream come true. Oh.
it-it is some kind of dream.
those hash browns look amazing.
but what are those?
those are supposed to be grits?
I'm disgusted. And I eat roadkill on the reg.
lemon, people are leaving, all right?
ratatouille back there can't cook grits.
you know how. You got to show him. What?
Hey, uh, everybody, hang tight a second, all right?
lemon is gonna show our brand-new chef how to cook grits.
all right?
I have mastered the classics of French cuisine from "A" to zed, but I have been vanquished by grits?
now you teach me?
the shame.
I made a mistake promising AnnaBeth I'd do the Shakespeare night.
I mean, I'm a football player-slash-mayor.
I'm not a football player- slash-mayor-slash-actor.
I can't humiliate myself in front of this town, in front of her.
Lavon, I've seen you make eloquent speeches, debate with gusto.
what makes you think you're gonna humiliate yourself?
do you recall a certain middle school production of The Wiz?
the one... the one with the stuttering Scarecrow?
Oh. Oh, my Lord.
you were the stuttering Scarecrow?
every time I even think about being onstage, it-it all comes back to me.
Lavon, that was a long time ago. You have matured.
th-there's no reason to avoid this.
hey there! Oh, Shelby, honey, uh, can't you see I have a patient?
Oh, sorry. Can't see who it is.
Hey, Lavon.
well, now that I'm here...
I wanted to see if you might want to get... lunch later.
I've barely seen you all week. I - I know.
I - I'm sorry, but the-the mayor needs me.
he is having a crisis of confidence.
he's... falling apart.
hello. I'm right here.
of course.
I'll be praying for you.
who is avoiding what here?
Hey. Who is the doctor here?
now, I have oodles of community theater experience.
I was the Modern Major-General, so I will clear the books, and I will spend the rest of the day... coaching you.
I... don't know. Uh, don't you have patients?
nothing is more important than helping the town's mayor.
first...
we improv.
no, no, no. But I can tutor Crickett myself.
she is terrible.
besides, the scandal of George Tucker and Zoe Hart performing
Romeo and Juliet will be a huge box office draw.
okay, well, Dash, listen, we know that you want to fill seats.
so I had an idea
how about Tom and Wanda as Romeo and Juliet, huh?
the newlyweds. I mean, they're fan favorites.
there won't be a dry eye in the house.
now, do you all take me for an amateur theater director?
Tom and Wanda was obviously my first choice, but they claimed to be consumed by their new business endeavors.
you leave it to us!
Yeah! Go!
Yeah.
two angels on horseback, BLT- burn one
and a large cow feed. Okay, enough with the diner lingo.
you know that I don't understand you.
Hey, okay, from now on, everybody gets the special until we slow down.
well, she's joking.
uh, we are still cooking to order.
Wade, please, I can't do this anymore, all right?
I'm exhausted. I'm not a chef.
well, at least no one's storming out, Lemon, so that's a plus.
so you have to. Besides, we don't have a chef, Lemon - thanks to you.
Yeah, well, at least my hire had other qualifications than "looks good in hot pants."
Fanny happens to be a waitressing savant.
you have got to be kidding me. You said I couldn't serve here unless I was 19.
well, that Fanny is a junior at Fillmore High.
Oh, no.
Oh, no. No, no, Fanny...
I'm sorry I lied.
a minor serving alcohol? Bill, we didn't know!
Oh, I'm sorry, but I have no choice.
it is my legal obligation to call this in.
and they're gonna be taking your liquor license.
and that's Bertha, Claudia,
Dolores, uh... Esther, Fae and, uh, Georgina.
we named her after you, George Tucker.
Aw. Thanks, guys.
they are very cute.
and I cannot believe that they all have names.
okay, so now about the Shakespeare show. Oh, we'd love to fill in.
great! But we can't.
I have to work at the Dixie Stop tonight, and Wanda's got her hands full taking care of our babies.
I have an idea.
they need to be given their sugar water every hour on the hour.
and look out for Miss Maisie Margaret - she's wily!
Oh, and don't forget to tape your socks to your suit.
the bees will get in anywhere.
and I mean an-y-where.
George, you ready?
I'll teach you how to work the cash register. Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Just give me one second.
all right. Okay.
Hey, Zoe. Hey, uh, thanks for doing this.
it's really touching to see how driven you are to help me and Tansy.
Oh, you, my friend, are welcome.
okay, well...
have fun.
okay, bees... here's your lunch.
yum!
Mmm, yummy yum yum!
okay...
who's in my pants?
okay, come on, get out!
get out! Out! Out! Get out!
us working together was obviously a mistake.
genius revelation, Lemon. We are a bar.
we cannot survive without alcohol.
and another one. You are really on a roll.
what are we gonna do?
nothing. What can we do?
now, now.
Wally, what are you doing here? Are you a ghost?
is this some kind of Obi-Wan thing?
no, I was just down there in the basement getting my popcorn maker when I overheard you two.
we lost our staff.
and our liquor license. Well, can't say that's not disappointing news.
we ruined your legacy, Wally.
I'm so sorry.
welcome to being a business owner.
it's hard. It'll suck the marrow from your bones.
but every once in a while, you're gonna look around, you're gonna realize this is your place...
your place...
...and sometimes that's gonna make it all worth it.
but whatever.
alcohol and Beverage Control doesn't close for the next half hour.
what are we waiting for? Let's go.
come on.
come on, now, Lavon, we have improv'd, we have discussed various theories and motivations.
curtain's in an hour. It is time to try the scene, at least once.
I think we should do more of those mime-y exercises first.
I can get out of the box. No...
I'm-I'm sorry. I should've shut this thing off.
Shelby again?
brick... what's going on with you two? It-it's complicated, you know.
there's just something I have to tell her, and, uh, I don't know how she's gonna take it.
but... we are here to work on your issues, so... so let's hear the speech.
no, no, Brick, I can't. Uh-uh.
Yes, you can! Lavon!
come on, on your feet. What we are gonna do is, we are gonna visualize.
okay? You... are not that stuttering Scarecrow anymore.
you are... Sir Ian McKellen.
you are Denzel Washington.
that's right. So, close your eyes now, and imagine with me - the theater is filled.
the lights are going down. You step on the stage.
the audience is waiting, watching.
they're breathless.
the curtain... goes up...
and...
Oh, come on, now.
I am so, so sorry, but I couldn't feed your bees.
what? I'm-I'm so sorry.
Th-They'll be so hungry. Uh, you know what?
you go, and I will do the scene with Tom.
don't worry, we will make you proud.
Oh. You're gonna kiss my husband.
just know, if there's any tongue, I'll remove yours.
noted. Hmm.
and... 32 cents is your change.
seriously, George, could you fall any further?
boy, I dodged a bullet with you, huh?
good to see you, too, Daisy.
Oh. Hey, babe. What are you doing here?
how-how's your throat? No?
why are you here? What happened to R & J?
Oh. As it turned out, Dash had asked Zoe to fill in for Juliet, and I obviously didn't think it was a good idea for me to kiss her.
why the 'H' not?" Uh...
because I knew how uncomfortable it'd make you... babe.
so... when he comes out, I'll do the talking.
what? No, I'll do the talking.
besides, it could be a woman, sexist. Good point.
those abs you must spend, what, 40 hours a week cultivating might actually prove useful.
didn't know you'd ever noticed them, Lemon. Well, how could I not, Wade?
you parade those things around town like they're dancing bears.
actually... You... stop it!
get your hands off! I am not a piece of meat.
Oh, my...
what are we doing? This doesn't make any sense at all.
well, well, well, who do we have here?
friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
brick. Hey there, honey pie. I just want to wish you good luck tonight.
flowers? Really?
the noble Brutus hath told you Caesar...
you have been blowing me off all week.
I've barely seen you since the hospital, and we live together. I know, and-and I'm sorry, but it's the therapy
it's a big time commitment. You know, preparing, then counseling.
but I promise you, just a few more days and then I am totally yours.
Yeah, well, I have to get ready. An actor prepares.
???
wait a minute. You're Juliet now? Nobody tells me anything.
all right, go... go find Romeo and run your lines.
Tom, I'm doing the scene with you now. I'm sorry.
what? No.
Tansy. It's... it's okay.
tansy and her, uh... her crazy girl logic thinks that me not wanting to kiss you means I have feelings for you, so if I don't kiss you, then she's gonna be pissed.
so... look, I-I just hope you brushed your teeth, Juliet, 'cause you and I are gonna be doing some major lip-locking.
well, well, well. The tables have turned.
ms. Curran, please, help us.
we had no way of knowing our new employee was a minor.
didn't you ask to see her driver's license?
well, she presented the only two forms of identification my partner checks.
the point is, we're... we're a new business.
we make mistakes.
surely, there must be some way we can make you forget this ever happened, right?
don't smile at me like that, Skeletor.
but I think we can make a deal. What are you offering?
uh... free drinks for life?
lemon, you can't bribe the Alcohol Control Board with free booze.
free breakfast?
free lunch. Oh, yes.
that's sweet.
but I think you both know exactly what it's going to take.
fine.
you're hired.
Yes.
all the world is a stage.
and all the men and women merely players.
they have their exits and their entrances.
and one man in his time plays many parts.
his act being seven ages.
at first, the infant, mewling and puking in his nurse's arms.
and then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel and shining morning face, creeping like a snail unwillingly to school.
Hey, there. I got your message.
I'm sorry about your migraines.
no, I'm sorry for leaving you in the lurch. You okay?
well, I have to do my scene with Dale King from second grade, who I know is a stalker and may try to peel my skin off later, but otherwise I'm fine.
guess doing one of these things with the man I care about is just not in the cards.
Annabeth, I lied.
I don't get migraines. It's just, I tried acting once.
I stunk. I don't want to go through that again.
well, you probably don't even remember...
the middle school production of The Wiz. Who could forget?
but, Lavon, this time will be different.
this time, you're doing a show with it.
no matter what, it will be something we did.
our first town event. And if we stink?
then we stink together.
where are you? Wanda! Wanda, I got your message.
is everything all right? No, Tom, nothing is all right.
our bees... gone.
okay, don't worry, we will find them.
we... we have to put on something more colorful. We have to look like flowers.
go to. I'm no more on it.
it hath made me mad!
I say we will have no more marriage!
those that are married already, all but one shall live.
the rest shall keep as they are.
to a nunnery. Go.
Yes!
and as Romeo comes upon Juliet's seemingly dead body, we begin.
arms...
take your last embrace. And, lips, O you:
the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss.
no need for kisses, because I'm totally fine.
what? No, you're not. Close call, Romeo.
Oh! It must be a vision.
thou who is obviously dead appeareth awake.
Oh, foul ghost, leave me.
allow me to kiss my very dead Juliet.
No! Not a ghost at all. I liveth!
I super-duper liveth. No kiss necessary.
but I feel death coming.
Nope. There's no death. Because it wasn't really poison.
it was just a sleeping potion, and now it has worn off.
and... happy ending!
I see how it must be thus. Thus.
but surely thou wouldst feel healthier...
with a kiss.
now...
with a kiss, I die.
damn it.
table four is good to go.
so, uh... the new cook's only here on a temporary basis.
so I'm sorry if there's any, uh...
well, now, you know, it really is quite good.
it is? Mm-hmm.
