sunspot activity and shifts in the earth's mag field
sunspot activity and shifts in the earth's mag field spanning 80 years,
sunspot activity, which follows an 11-year cycle, is due to peak in 2013 after which it will start to wane slightly. But astronomers think the next upswing will be less intensive than normal, or could fail to happen at all.
Sunspot: a temporary cool region in the solar photosphere.
sunspots also have an effect on the earth's magnetic field.
sunspots are a bit of a mystery.
sunspots are caused by irruptions into its surface of the sun's deeper magnetism.
sunspots are darker than the surrounding area because they are slightly cooler, which makes them less luminous.
sunspots flare up these extra doses of energy...
sunspots indicate magnetic activity.
sunspots vary tremendously in size, ranging from less than 200 miles across to many times the size of the earth.
sunspots wax and wane on an 11-year cycle; at times of peak sunspot activity, such as the year 2000, the sun is 0.07 percent brighter than during periods of low activity.
sunstein argues persuasively that quantifying upsides and downsides and laying them bare improves both markets and government.
sunstein does his best to drain his approach of any ideological spirit.
sunstein used his office as a laboratory for his brand of "libertarian paternalism"--his self-described and seemingly paradoxical approach to structuring prompts for people that promote their welfare by protecting them from their more self-destructive impulses.
sunstein's team answered this grim question by weighing both what individuals say they would pay to eliminate the risk of one death out of, say, 100,000, and calculating the wage premiums that companies pay to reward that risk.
sunstein, now on the faculty at harvard, has a name for this approach: "I like to think of him as a 'university of chicago' democrat."

suntech (stp), based in wuxi, china, builds high-quality, inexpensive solar panels that have been installed in 80 countries.
suntech ceo zhengrong shi made china a powerhouse in photovoltaic technology--and became a billionaire in the process.
suntech declined to comment, while emails to yingli and ldk, which has disclosed concerns about liquidity, weren't answered.
suntech has encouraged executives at its united states operations to take the top posts at the two main american industry groups, partly to make sure that these groups do not rally opposition to imports, dr. shi said.
suntech power (stp, news): 2010 was just a terrible year for solar power companies as economic and financial crises in the united states and, more importantly, in europe cut into government subsidies for solar power.
suntech too posted losses and warned the current quarter could be worse than the last.
suntech's founder, shi zhengrong, a chinese-born australian scientist, was lauded by the communist government as a leading entrepreneur.
suntech's mr. beebe said trade restrictions 'large or small' would delay america's embrace of cleaner energy.
suntech, a chinese solar-power company, has established a low-carbon museum to celebrate ways of reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.
suntech, based in wuxi, is temporarily closing a quarter of its solar cell capacity.
suntech, in may of 2010, agreed to put forward 554 million euros as a loan guarantee.
suntech, the world's largest manufacturer of solar panels, which also operates a panel plant in arizona, denied it sold below its cost of production.
suntech, which accounted for 10% of the solar module and panel market globally last year, has its own troubles.
Suntides includes a pro shop, snack bar, cart rentals, driving range, practice putting green, a chipping green, and a banquet room.

suntour fell victim to the fast changing bicycle market that started in 1983 with mountain bikes and indexed shifting.
suntour had good patent attorneys and they vigorously defended the slant parallelogram design.
suntour licensed three developments to provide excitement and uniqueness.
suntour lost more money and suntour-usa borrowed against their inventories to help cover the losses.
suntour posted a large loss and they had to borrow more money from the banks.
suntour realized that the market had shifted to indexed shifting.
suntour rushed engineers and service people from japan to the factories and the bike shops to identify and correct the problems.
suntour suffered another major loss and the japanese banks would not make new loans.
suntour was the preferred derailleur maker in the export market.
suntour was too small to maintain the kind of research and development department that was needed to survive.
suntour's 1980 new winner freewheel offered complete flexibility.
