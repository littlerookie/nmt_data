Yeah, that was a fascinating story.
Yeah, that was a good audition.
Yeah, that was a good call. I like you.
Yeah, that was a good fight.
Yeah, that was a good one,
Yeah, that was a hell of a magic trick.
Yeah, that was a lie.
Yeah, that was a little excessive.
Yeah, that was a long time ago, but it still feels like yesterday.
Yeah, that was a long time ago.
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
Yeah, that was a lot of paper towels.
Yeah, that was a mistake.
Yeah, that was a nice service. A nice service.

Yeah, that was a real feat of strength.
Yeah, that was a real good one.
Yeah, that was a real mess
Yeah, that was a really good picture.
Yeah, that was a stupid suggestion.
Yeah, that was a terrible thing.
Yeah, that was a turning point.
Yeah, that was a, uh... That was an unfortunate week.
Yeah, that was after she threw the drink on her.
Yeah, that was amazing,
Yeah, that was an accident.
Yeah, that was an awesome, an awesome review.

Yeah, that was behind us.
Yeah, that was brutal.
Yeah, that was brute.
Yeah, that was convenient.
Yeah, that was convincing.
Yeah, that was cool. Yeah.
Yeah, that was crazy.

Yeah, that was kind of personal.
Yeah, that was kind of personal.
Yeah, that was kind of the idea.
Yeah, that was lucky, you know?
Yeah, that was me, man.
Yeah, that was me, man.
Yeah, that was me.
Yeah, that was me. And he wasn't just up there.
Yeah, that was me. Come on in.
Yeah, that was me. He's over there.
Yeah, that was me. I complained.
Yeah, that was me. I dialed your number by mistake.
Yeah, that was me. I had finally made it.
Yeah, that was me. That was me talking to you.
Yeah, that was me. That was me talking to you.
Yeah, that was me. Why? Who called?
Yeah, that was more for effect.
Yeah, that was more of a phrase than anything.
Yeah, that was my boyfriend.
Yeah, that was my dad's idea.
Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too.
Yeah, that was my father's college.
Yeah, that was my fault.
Yeah, that was my first thought, too.
Yeah, that was my idea.
Yeah, that was my next one.
Yeah, that was my room.
Yeah, that was my runner - up, too.
Yeah, that was my signature move.
Yeah, that was n ice, kid. You're o ne hot faggot.
Yeah, that was nice.
Yeah, that was no model.
Yeah, that was not a good day.
Yeah, that was not easy.
Yeah, that was not right. - that was messed up.

Yeah, that was pre-mirage,
Yeah, that was pretty dumb. Yep, it was.
Yeah, that was pretty funny.
Yeah, that was pretty good, wasn't it?
Yeah, that was pretty intense, huh?
Yeah, that was pretty lucky, huh? All I have to do is give him a hand
Yeah, that was pretty scary, huh?
Yeah, that was pretty weird.
Yeah, that was probably all you guys talked about,
Yeah, that was probably, like, our best one.
Yeah, that was pushing it a little, huh?
Yeah, that was real convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten ton magical monster.
Yeah, that was real fresh, Bobby brown.
Yeah, that was real good.
Yeah, that was real good.
Yeah, that was real.
Yeah, that was real.
Yeah, that was really cool. Why don't you...
Yeah, that was really disgusting.
Yeah, that was really scary. Did you see anything?
Yeah, that was right before he was a funeral seat filler.
Yeah, that was six years ago. Let's get on with it, huh?
Yeah, that was so interesting. Thanks.
Yeah, that was so much fun. What did we talk about?
Yeah, that was so unbelievable.
Yeah, that was so weird. It came out of nowhere.
Yeah, that was some crazy shit huh? Yeah.
Yeah, that was some night. I was homeless and hungry.
Yeah, that was something, huh?
Yeah, that was stupid of me.
Yeah, that was the first awkward silence
Yeah, that was the fishing net, right?
Yeah, that was the fun part.
Yeah, that was the goal. Is that okay?
Yeah, that was the guy he said it wasn't.
Yeah, that was the highlight of my day.
Yeah, that was the idea.
Yeah, that was the last time I saw him. I heard later he was missing...
Yeah, that was the look on my face when I figured it out.
Yeah, that was the message.
Yeah, that was the plan, but, you know...
Yeah, that was the point, dingleberry -
Yeah, that was the question.
Yeah, that was the reason that we trusted her.
Yeah, that was the risk they took.
Yeah, that was the romantic notion I was going or. Thank you.
Yeah, that was the same morning.
Yeah, that was the same morning.
Yeah, that was the story when I was in the garage.
Yeah, that was the worst night of my life.
Yeah, that was the, uh, highlight of my morning.
Yeah, that was then, okay?
Yeah, that was then. I'm "the mailman" now.
Yeah, that was to seed the fire.
Yeah, that was unfortunate.
Yeah, that was unfortunate. I would love to.
Yeah, that was until he gave you the wrong exam.
Yeah, that was very helpful.
Yeah, that was weak.
Yeah, that was weird to me, too.
Yeah, that was weird, wasn't it?
Yeah, that was when my mother and my brother died
Yeah, that was worth three hours in front of the bathroom mirror.
Yeah, that was wrong.
Yeah, that was you.
Yeah, that was you. Great.
Yeah, that was you. I thought so.
Yeah, that was your dad.
Yeah, that was, I think that was a joke.
Yeah, that was, uh... Priceless.
Yeah, that was, um, pretty crazy.
Yeah, that was, um...
Yeah, that was...
Yeah, that was... I thought since we're on the same flight.
Yeah, that was... Something, huh?
Yeah, that was... That was better.
Yeah, that was... That was just...
Yeah, that was... That was quite a show.
Yeah, that was... That was... That was my worry.
Yeah, that was... Your love child.
Yeah, that wasn't great.
Yeah, that wasn't half bad.
Yeah, that wasn't her.
Yeah, that wasn't it.
Yeah, that wasn't ours.
Yeah, that wasn't smart.
Yeah, that wasn't there last night when I docked her.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that
Yeah, that way none of us have to deal with the monster.
Yeah, that we are.
Yeah, that we should have gone to Mount Rushmore.
Yeah, that we should throw a party
Yeah, that we should throw a party and hire a bunch of models.
Yeah, that we weren't fooling anyone.
Yeah, that went down well at Langley...
Yeah, that went well.
Yeah, that were mine, actually.
Yeah, that what Dee Dee said.
Yeah, that whittles it down to, like, 200.
Yeah, that whole digital - revolution thing screwed us pretty good.
Yeah, that whole digital revolution thing screwed us pretty good,
Yeah, that whole feeling part - not really interested.
Yeah, that whole on - again, off - again thing, that's not good.
Yeah, that will be nice. Yeah.
Yeah, that will be the "real - world" explanation.
Yeah, that will explain the fur and booshy tales.
Yeah, that will give you a wallop. Y 'all got camping supplies?
Yeah, that will happen, won't it?
Yeah, that will lead them right
Yeah, that will lead them right
Yeah, that will take a while.
Yeah, that with the two heaviest dudes.
Yeah, that woman is against everything I stand for.
Yeah, that won't be a problem.
Yeah, that won't be a problem. Okay.
Yeah, that won't be happening. I'm declaring a mistrial. Your honor!
Yeah, that won't work on me.
Yeah, that work. She doesn't even want you in here.
Yeah, that worked out for you?
Yeah, that worked out so well for us, didn't it?
Yeah, that worked, didn't it? Yeah.
Yeah, that works for me, too.
Yeah, that works for me.
Yeah, that works pretty well.
Yeah, that works too.
Yeah, that works, thanks.
Yeah, that works.
Yeah, that works. Karen.
Yeah, that works. Yeah.
Yeah, that would be - that would be stupid.
Yeah, that would be 1 1 sazeracs talking.
Yeah, that would be a great theory if I flew the exact same plane every time.
Yeah, that would be a me.
Yeah, that would be a real loss to society.
Yeah, that would be a shame, wouldn't it?
Yeah, that would be annoying.
Yeah, that would be bad for business.
Yeah, that would be bad.
Yeah, that would be convenient.
Yeah, that would be cool, I just never get to do stuff like that
Yeah, that would be fine.
Yeah, that would be great - to go revisit the worst four years of my life.
Yeah, that would be great, yeah.
Yeah, that would be great. Cool.
Yeah, that would be great. Great. What's his number?
Yeah, that would be great. It'd be good.
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.
Yeah, that would be great. Tomorrow. Okay.
Yeah, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Yeah, that would be him.
Yeah, that would be it.
Yeah, that would be just perfect.
Yeah, that would be me. You know, I'm his dad.
Yeah, that would be my guess.
Yeah, that would be neat. Thanks.
Yeah, that would be nice to have.
Yeah, that would be nice, but I just need the card.
Yeah, that would be nice.
Yeah, that would be perfect because,
Yeah, that would be perfect because,
Yeah, that would be problematic given the
Yeah, that would be so much cooler than pulling up in my dad's pizza truck.
Yeah, that would be so much cooler than pulling up in my dad's pizza truck.
Yeah, that would be super.
Yeah, that would be the " he " I'm referring to.
Yeah, that would be the grief counselor I've been asking you to see for the last three months.
Yeah, that would be the other body.
Yeah, that would be time maintenance.
Yeah, that would be... That would be stupid.
Yeah, that would been a shame
Yeah, that would do it.
Yeah, that would do the trick.
Yeah, that would explain everything.
Yeah, that would explain it, wouldn't it?
Yeah, that would explain the catchup.
Yeah, that would explain why there's no blood on the ground and no splatter leading in.
Yeah, that would get her
Yeah, that would have been a good idea.
Yeah, that would have been a great idea five minutes ago.
Yeah, that would have been a much simpler problem.
Yeah, that would have been great, too, but he starts school again tomorrow,
Yeah, that would have been great.
Yeah, that would have been my second guess.
Yeah, that would have helped.
Yeah, that would have made more sense.
Yeah, that would help.
Yeah, that would make her your mom too.
Yeah, that would probably do the trick.
Yeah, that would probably make sense, actually.
Yeah, that would probably make sense.
Yeah, that would provide a pathway
Yeah, that would provide a pathway from the high to the low sides.
Yeah, that would sort out the spill from this light here.
Yeah, that would've been a good time to discuss this.
Yeah, that would've been a lot easier. Yeah.
Yeah, that would've been good.
Yeah, that would've been hard. He's the sweetest man I've ever known.
Yeah, that would've been nice.
Yeah, that would've been sooooo coooool.
Yeah, that would... That would be great.
Yeah, that would... That'd be great.
Yeah, that wouldn't have been awkward.
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me none.
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me.
Yeah, that wouldn't work for me.
Yeah, that wouldn't work.
Yeah, that yawn looked pretty scary.
Yeah, that you accused her of being an imposter?
Yeah, that you don't even know when somebody loves you.
Yeah, that you got yourself into.
Yeah, that you were watching my performance.
Yeah, that you're gonna have to get me a new one.
Yeah, that you're gonna have to get me a new one.
Yeah, that you're on a mission, right
Yeah, that your mother and my sister were singing show tunes in tomato - red dresses.
