carrick and macgregor made several rural expeditions, including a month long trip to simbirsk province in 1871.
carrick concedes that a major factor behind his improvement as a player has been down to training and playing with midfield partner paul scholes.
carrick did similar business with other artists; after his death in 1879 many of these were published in his album of russian artists.
carrick got the geese to follow him by using a process called imprinting in which the birds attach to the first moving object they see after breaking out of their shells.
carrick represents a different kind of player, the intelligent ball playing anchorman in the mould of italy's andrea pirlo, or in previous years argentina's fernando redondo or spain's josep guardiola.
carrick says he has no fears about the arrival of owen hargreaves, and also feels that giggs has made him a better player.
