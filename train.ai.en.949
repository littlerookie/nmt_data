we expect her to show up for family dinners?
not when you... lay into her when she finally does show up.
what am I supposed to I do, coddle her? Buy her a pony?
I'm sure she'll be home soon.
and you need to stop covering for her, okay?
it does her no good. - Okay, okay.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap.
it's a tough time for everyone.
we haven't even asked you about your day.
how was, you know, school?
how's the band? How is that going?
well, we... got this amazing opportunity to play at this huge music festival in California.
California. Yikes.
it's one of the most prestigious festivals in the country.
it's, like, three days and nights of nonstop music from all over the world.
Yeah, I think I've heard of it. It's called Parents Worst Nightmare
actually, it's really well-organized.
and Baz's uncle has a place right there that we could stay.
you're not actually thinking about this, are you?
you're 16 years old. - It's just a weekend.
I think it is a long time to go unchaperoned. - Yeah, you're not kidding.
look, sweetie, you guys are great.
you keep at it, you will get something great. Something local.
I'm sure you will. - Yeah.
that's what I thought.
and we're gonna have a verdict by the end of the month, and that's good.
it's great for the district, you know. People want safe streets.
I know. I read the polls.
this could be a stepping stone, you know.
lot of bigger blue-chip political careers have been launched with far less fanfare.
aren't you just a little concerned that you might have an innocent man?
Ethan Whitehorse is a bad egg.
he's always been a bad egg.
you look up "bad egg" in the dictionary, there's a picture of Ethan Whitehorse.
Yeah, but that doesn't make him a murderer.
I'm sorry to disturb you.
it seems someone has left a message for you with our hostess.
okay, thanks.
that's odd. No one knows I'm here.
what is it?
that's just... silly.
that doesn't upset you? - Nope.
but if it makes you feel better, I'll go try and find out who left it.
no. Whoever sent it is probably long gone by now.
look, I pissed somebody off, that's all.
now they're trying to intimidate me with a scary note.
it's not gonna work.
who would want to do this to you?
a lot of people. That's a long list.
I work with the dregs of society.
I lock 'em up and hope they lose the key.
doesn't exactly endear me to a lot of people.
I've got a whole steamer trunk full of hate mail I...
look, why don't we just let it go?
how do you know this has nothing to do with Derek Roger's case?
I'm not sure I follow your line of questioning.
well, I'm-I'm just saying.
I mean, that's the case that you're working on right now, right?
what if somebody knows something?
what are you trying to say?
well, I could see how you could be so quick to accuse Ethan.
tell you what. We both had a little bit to drink.
maybe I should just get the check.
that way, neither one us might say something we'll regret later.
I'm telling you, it's like a minefield back there.
Ted and Kristin are so freaked out by this trial.
sounds like someone is trying to keep me from taking my life back.
Hey, if you think you're up for it, be my guest.
it's just not gonna be easy for you.
they don't know how to deal with it.
the other night, they got in a huge fight about me.
you. You-You know. - Really?
I'm just saying, if you say the wrong thing, you might get shipped off to boarding school.
uniforms. Okay.
well, I guess you can keep being me until the trial is over.
I mean, I need to decompress after the ranch...
right.
I'm sorry. That was insensitive.
but if it's any consolation, Ethan was talking about you the whole time we were there.
Really? - Oh, yeah.
we would go on these really long rides
you know, to exercise the horses
and he just kept going on and on - about how much you would love it there. - Sounds amazing.
it's just like a whole other world out there.
it's just so beautiful and spiritual.
I don't know. Compared to Phoenix, it's just so much more real.
you'll get there someday.
well, okay, I have to fly, because...
that was a parental warning call. - they need to get a life.
they care about you.
I know, I know.
I have to confess, I'm a little envious that you got to spend so much time with Ethan at the ranch. Meet his father.
Oh, you would love Ben.
he and Ethan have a very rough relationship.
although, I have to say, I think I may have actually brought them closer together.
I don't know, Emma. I think you're rubbing off on me.
well, I'm glad to hear that.
good. Now maybe you can help me repair my friendship with Mads.
I'm sure it'll be fine. It'll just take some time.
okay, be safe.
Hey!
don't forget your phone.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Hey. It's okay.
I was starting to think you were gonna stand me up.
so unlike you, and so like Sutton.
okay, she's not entirely bad.
please. You should have seen her with me, pretending she had no idea why I'd be furious with her.
well, sometimes she just acts that way.
if it helps, she did say she feels awful about what happened with you guys.
Really? - Yes.
in fact, she asked me if I would help make things right.
I don't know. Things are just crazy for everyone right now.
and how are you holding up?
well, Theresa said vshe would text me about getting in to see Ethan, but I haven't heard from her.
guess it just didn't work out.
Sutton? You ready?
Yes. Let's do this.
you have five minutes.
I don't believe this.
I left a file in my car. It's in the lot right across the street,
Yeah, okay. Make it snappy.
you, stand behind the yellow line.
Romeo, keep your hands inside.
I missed you.
is everything okay?
there's something I have to tell you.
when I was on my dad's ranch with Sutton, something happened.
it almost happened. It was stupid.
okay. Well, I understand.
I mean, you and Sutton have a... have a past.
no.
no. It-it was a mistake.
okay, I regretted it the second it happened, and I felt sick about it ever since.
are you sure that's how you feel?
Emma, you have to believe me.
Sutton means nothing to me.
nothing.
I see.
you know, there's something that I have to tell you.
when I...
when you were away, I was...
scared.
and...
lonely, and...
Thayer was there for me.
and neither of us meant for it to happen, but we couldn't...
Thayer and I slept together.
I just think when it seems like we're not on the same page, - it sends a confusing message. - I understand, I get it.
knock-knock. Am I interrupting?
no. - No, no, come sit.
what do you know? She still lives here. I guess I lost that bet.
I'm kidding.
can I make you some breakfast, like an omelet, egg whites? - No, thank you.
I just want to apologize for not checking in with you guys.
well, yeah, we do... We do need to know where you are, - but we also appreciate that... - That you understand that that's an expectation.
no, I do.
but the other night, I overheard you arguing, and I felt really bad.
Sutton, it's o... it's okay for couples to have disagreements.
this was worse than that.
you guys were fighting, and you never fight.
and I know it was because of me and this trial, and...
I don't want to do that to you.
honey, that-that wasn't your fault.
your mother's right. Look, we should be apologizing to you for the other night.
I mean, we came on way too strong; I did, especially.
we both did, and we know how hard this it for you, and mostly, we just...we want you to be happy.
that's all we've ever wanted.
we understand your heart is with Ethan, and honestly, you were right, we should have presumed he was innocent;he deserves that.
if you want us to be with you at court, we will be there.
thank you. That means a lot.
but you don't have to go to court. - Okay.
I just... I really, really love Ethan.
and if we could have a relationship as strong as yours, how great would that be?
I can't believe they're okay with it.
I know, they were so cool.
they even offered to go to Ethan's arraignment with me.
I know, but it was nice that they offered.
that's so weird, though. They were acting so 1950s strict the other night.
who knows? Maybe they knew I wasn't gonna back down on this and thought it wasn't worth the battle.
Baz, wait up.
so, guess who's gonna be joining the band at Coachella 2012?
get out.
Oh, I'm totally stoked!
how did the elders finally come around?
maybe they knew I was not gonna back down on this.
wasn't worth the battle.
hardball. I like it.
and by the way, if you have any nervousness about the travel or, like, accommodations or whatever, you can relax.
I have no intention of taking advantage of your newly-broken-up status.
no intention of taking advantage how exactly?
Oh, you know.
like the old movie-theater yawn turns into an arm around you.
or the "I'm-late-for-class, see you
suddenly becomes a little gratuitous peck on the cheek. Like so.
well, I am late for class.
see ya.
thank you for the breakfast invitation.
Hey, I'm glad we were able to clear things up before the arraignment today.
I'm sorry that I doubted you last night.
it's all right. It's totally understandable.
it's pretty crazy stuff. - Yeah.
important thing to learn is not to panic.
well, I feel a lot better about things now.
I'm glad to hear it.
what's up?
nothing. It's just a shoe sale or something; I'm on some list.
shoe sale?
I could use a new pair of wing tips.
okay, clearly, it's a prank.
it's a setup; it's got to be.
why would they send it to you?
how should I know? Why aren't we calling the police?
do that reverse dial thing you do, will you? Do that again.
I've done it like five times. It's disconnected;there's no point.
well, clearly, somebody's playing me.
but who? It can't be Dan;he's not smart enough.
why didn't you tell me that you were at the scene of the crime that night?
you never asked.
look, I didn't want to muddy the investigation. That's it.
it's muddy now.
okay.
I was there.
Derek Rogers had left me five or six text messages that afternoon, saying it was a life-and-death emergency. He had to see me.
I went down there to talk to him about it, he denied ever sending any text at all.
he started getting all shaky.
he said that Ethan Whitehorse had attacked him that afternoon.
I grabbed him by the shirt, and I told him to knock it off.
keep me out of it. But that was it.
so, why are you holding the tire iron?
am I on trial here?
I told you what happened.
he said that Ethan came down there and had attacked him.
now, when I got down there, I saw him with the tire iron in his hand, and I took it away from him;I disarmed him.
when Ethan came back, he must have picked it up - and used it to bash Derek's head in. - You're so sure of everything.
but how would they know? - Know what?
about the murder weapon.
we haven't released that information to the public.
so, how would they know?
we're not calling the police, Why?
cause the arraignment's today.
baby, we can't risk this. Your prints are probably all over that thing.
you know, if-if this...if this gets out...
damn it.
I'm sorry, I - I have to ask you this, and...
and I promise I'll never bring it up again, but I... I need you to be honest with me.
did you kill Derek Rogers?
nervous?
Oh, terrified.
what if he gets denied bail and is thrown in jail indefinitely?
these things have a way of working themselves out.
sometimes, you just have to be patient.
wait long enough, and your day will come.
come on.
are you certain this is how you want to proceed, Mr. District Attorney?
we are , you honor.
ms. Lopez? - Yes, thank you, you honor
Mr.
will the defendant please stand?
in the matter of People v. Whitehorse, the case is dismissed for insufficient evidence.
bailiff, release the defendant.
well, Mr. Whitehorse, looks like you're free to go.
thank you.
you're welcome.
you did it; I don't know how, but you did it.
thank you.
not so sure about that, Danny.
I'm not so sure at all.
what did I tell you?
sometimes an older person knows best.
can you give me a ride home?
Yeah.
what was that about?
well, maybe Ethan was overwhelmed by the moment, and that's why he was distant.
sweetie, I'm so sorry.
I'm here if you need me.
Hey, sis.
what are you doing here?
well...
I heard how weird Ethan was to you at the courthouse, and I think I know why.
I was really hoping Ethan and I... could put this behind us, but obviously...
Oh, man, this is hard.
just say it.
I don't know why it happened...
but one night, we lit a fire, and...
got cozy.
and we were talking, and one thing led to another, and...
Ethan and I slept together.
I know. Ouch, right?
a few months ago, I discovered I had a twin sister.
and then she she asked me to take her place, keep the secret, find our real mother and try to stay alive.
put yourself in my shoes.
how long could you keep up the lying game?
what's wrong?
it's just if that picture gets into the wrong hands, this is how it's gonna end?
I might have a solution.
okay. We have something to share with you.
we're getting married!
it looks like my dad's guilt comes down to whether Rebecca was telling the truth about where he was the night of Derek's murder.
so we start doing some digging on Rebecca.
the love of her life was always in Phoenix.
do you know she always had a photograph of his in a locket around her neck?
Oh, my God.
did you sleep with Rebecca?
no. Why are you bringing this up again?
because every time I do, you shut me down.
I'm sorry. I can't.
Why?
I kissed Sutton. But it's over now.
there's always gonna be a part of you that wishes that you could be with her.
what are you doing here?
you're not answering. What do you want me to do?
I don't know. I... Just... move on.
no. I'm not letting you go.
I'm not. And that's not what I said.
no. You said... "It's complicated."
I'm sorry. I promise this will never happen again.
how do you know that?
I just do. All right?
tell me how I can prove it to you.
...that night at the motel, that was gonna be my first time.
I know. That's why I said something.
I want to be honest with you.
the problem is... the truth really hurts.
honey, what happened? You left so early.
sorry. I just needed to clear my head.
of what? What's going on?
nothing. It's probably my fault. The trip to Coachella was a bust.
Ethan and I broke up.
what?
when? How... how is that even possible - you were away.
he came with us.
on an overnight trip, when you were supposed to be chaperoning your younger sister?
I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
I shouldn't have asked him to come.
and I shouldn't... I'm sorry.
honey, wait.
come here. Oh, sweetie.
Oh, sweetie. I'm so sorry.
no. I'm sorry.
you have so much on your plate.
I was wrong about that.
just, I dragged you into that. I shouldn't... - Listen to me.
I was wrong. there was no affair with Rebecca, Nothing... nothing happened.
Oh, thank God.
and it doesn't matter.
you are what's important.
how could Ethan do this?
you stood by him when he was in jail. You never doubted him.
Ethan has feelings for someone else.
so, I'm thinking the archway'll be here.
massive flowers.
Massive? You mean, like, big?
peonies - are they even in season?
we could put dogwood on each side...
and you're putting this together in a day?
well, it's the day after tomorrow, so technically, that's... two days, but...
okay, fine, daisies, roses, whatever.
but I will need a dress - maybe not a Vera Wang, since it's not my first trip down the aisle.
and I'll need a maid of honor.
Mads?
Oh, my God, really?
Oh, that's so sweet.
well, that means I need a new dress, too, Dad.
whatever my girls want, they get.
I'll need a best man.
what do you think, Thayer?
honestly? I... I think it's a little sudden.
but, you know, not that I'm not thrilled, it's just, you know, what's the rush?
what's the rush?
love makes you do crazy things, like not wait around life to start... huh?
Yes.
my mom must be devastated, right?
just leave.
I saw you guys hugging and crying.
must be about Rebecca and my dad. The affair?
no, it didn't happen.
Kristin talked to Ted; he said there was no affair.
well, either Rebecca is a crazy stalker, or my dad is lying.
it's Rebecca's.
I snuck into her house last night and stole it.
Sutton... - Just open it.
why does Rebecca have a picture of Ted?
I told you when I met you I thought my dad was lying about something.
this is just the beginning, I can feel it.
I think you should show that to Kristin.
me?
well, don't you think she deserves to know?
and besides, I think that maybe she could help us figure everything out.
come on, you guys have gotten close.
I'm sure you'll find the right thing to say.
I really don't think there is a right... way to say this.
wait, so if... Kristin... wasn't the one crying, then... what...?
Ethan and I broke up.
what? Why?
like you really don't know why.
he told me what happened at the ranch. How you guys...
Oh, my God, what is happening to me?
I actually feel bad for you.
I'm sure it'll pass.
just enough time for you to go over to the trailer and throw yourself at him... again.
so what if I do? You guys are broken up, right?
maid of honor? What are you doing? Last night we were about to accuse...
murder. I know. Thank God it never got that far.
I can't believe I ever listened to you guys. I never believed it.
Mads, we talked to Jesse, that frat guy.
Thayer, you saw Dad.
he's in love, all kisses and smiles.
if he's acting like that after he murdered someone, he's not just a criminal, he's a psychopath.
Hey, I'm just looking at the facts.
and so am I, and the fact is, I've never seen Dad this happy.
not even with Mom.
well, then you're forgetting, Mom was the love of his life.
and how miserable has he been since she left?
and what did he do? He took it out on us. But not lately.
okay, that still doesn't explain the eyewitness.
why can't you see that? - Because he's our father!
and you have no proof! You have nothing!
you and Dad have been screwed up for a long time now, and this is your big chance to screw him right back.
no, Mads, no, it's Rebecca, it's the wedding, it's too fast.
I know it's fast, but I don't care.
dad's happy.
for once, can't you just let him be?
it's so hot.
what? I'm just stating the obvious.
and you, my friend, are a giant neon sign of sexy right now.
what are you doing here?
I just talked to Emma.
poor girl. She is really suffering.
but you know what, I am so glad that you finally were honest with her.
this is none of your business.
isn't it, though?
I mean, everything that happened with us at the ranch.
I know we didn't actually sleep together, but...
I mean, you can't deny that our connection was real.
whatever connection we had, it disappeared the second you got home and turned back into the lying bitch you've always been.
a connection? Those feelings?
they're gone... and they're never coming back.
so you say.
you seem pretty pissed off for a guy who doesn't give a damn, though.
now, I... am a patient girl, and I say that you and me, we are a big, fat yes.
just a question of when.
well, I have my eyes a little further down the field.
"governor Rybak" has a certain ring to it, doesn't it?
not bad. And a beautiful new wife never hurt a campaign.
no, sir.
I'll see you in a couple of days. - All right, my sticks are in my trunk. Anytime.
I'm feeling a little nervous. - Really?
Yeah. - You got cold feet, all of a sudden?
no. Hardly. Are you?
no. Not at all.
I'm good. I just wish my kids were.
well, I thought Mads seemed...
no, no, Mads is fine; it's Thayer, giving me all these speeches about how we should slow down, and not take things so fast, you know?
what? - It's gonna be okay.
we're safe, as long as the two of us are together.
I like the sound of that.
Hi. How are you?
actually, I'm so glad you're here. You were on my call list, but now that you're here in person, I can just tell you.
tell me what?
we're getting married.
day after tomorrow, and we would love for you and Ted to attend.
marriage?
I-I-I don't know what to say.
say you'll be there to support us, to be there.
Yes, of course.
great.
one second, would you excuse me? - You're always ringing.
Hello?
Alec's a dear friend, and I...
I'm actually thrilled he's found someone to spend the rest of his life with.
thank you so much. It means a lot.
Rebecca, I know I've been distant and acting a little weird lately.
I-I-I want you to know Ted and I talked, and everything is fine, so I'm...
I'm sorry, I'm just... I'm not making sense.
no, no. I'm just glad he finally told you.
finally told me what?
I'm so sorry.
I misunderstood, and...
Kristin, I really hope you can make the wedding.
I'm sorry.
everything okay?
Yeah, Ethan, this isn't about you.
well, what...
mom.
Hey, Emma, wait, please, don't walk away from me again.
I just... I can't do this right now.
mom? - Sweetie, I'm just leaving.
please, I need to talk to you. It's important.
okay.
please just open it. It's Rebecca's.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
it's an older picture, though, right?
so, I don't know what Dad told you. I-I shouldn't have shown it to you.
no, you did the right thing; I'm so sorry you're in the middle of this.
no, it's fine. Mom?
I'm sorry, I have to go.
look, when you were at the ranch, Dan was helping us out.
he was on out side, but don't forget he has all that history with my dad.
well, we have to something. I mean, my dad and Rebecca?
Rebecca's hands are dirty. Alec's hands are dirty.
if the two of them get married, it's like the bad guys win.
what are you guys doing?
we're actually here for them.
we have to talk to you.
my dad's getting married in two days to his only alibi for Derek's murder.
Rebecca? - Yeah.
wow, she works fast.
well, as much as I'd like to believe in true love, something about this doesn't sound right.
spousal privilege.
if Alec and Rebecca are married, she can't be asked to testify against him.
I know she's lying about that night.
Yeah, but it's not just that.
my dad and Rebecca had an affair.
it was a long time ago, but I don't trust the woman. She has secrets.
why else would this marriage have to be happening so fast?
it's not just because of Derek's murder.
listen, you guys got to knock it off, all right?
you're kids. You're in way over your head with this thing.
I'm not a kid. Not anymore.
it doesn't matter.
just leave this case for the police.
trust me, we're working on it.
and that's all you need to know.
it's pretty cool, especially since she offered to pay us.
I mean, I guess we don't really have a lot of "Ode to Joy" in our repertoire, but...
what's the gig?
the wedding, duh.
right, yeah, I heard.
maybe Rebecca's pregnant.
what? I mean, two days?
you know, the engagement dinner's tomorrow night.
this is definitely a rush job.
which means I should probably get to work.
let me know when dinner's ready. - Yeah.
crazy, right? But it's great.
I mean, now you can stop worrying about Rebecca and all your ideas.
she's marrying our best friend.
wedding sounds fun.
it's gonna be a great night for all of us.
here you go.
what's going on?
I never should have showed Kristin the locket.
I just thought that if it were me...
you know, the Ethan and Sutton... thing.
I just feel like it's all gonna blow up.
you're right. It's all hitting at once.
and I'm glad you're here.
it's okay.
I'm sorry, I know that you have this stuff to deal with...
it's okay, it's fine, it's fine.
what?
it's... You've just been the one bright spot in all of this.
Sutton, is this really necessary?
Yes, of course. I always say dress the part, or in this case, the situation.
purple. We look so good in purple.
okay, going to this thing and participating in this hypocrisy...
could help uncover the truth about Rebecca and Alec.
especially Alec.
Hi.
Hey, yourself.
what are you doing here?
Oh, come on, like he hasn't seen all that and more?
look, I know Thayer's been on this, but I think I can help get you guys some answers, prove Rebecca's alibi for Alec is a lie.
what Emma is saying with her silence is that she is dying to know all the answers, but is just a little unsure that she wants you involved.
you know what, Sutton? I can speak for myself.
so?
what did you have in mind? Specifically.
I want to break into Rebecca's house while she's at the engagement dinner.
and maybe find something that proves that her alibi is bogus.
I like it.
you're not just good looks.
Emma? What do you say?
just don't get caught.
are you okay?
Yeah. - Come on, let's go.
Hey, how are you doing?
looks like quite a lot happened on that trip to Coachella.
okay, he's not here as my date; Rebecca invited him.
they're very close, you know.
sure, okay. Well, come on, Baz, I'm gonna buy you a Shirley Temple.
mom, what's going on? Did you talk to Dad about the locket?
I don't want to talk about that now.
let's just go inside.
thank you. I'm sorry about you and Sutton.
okay.
well, for what it's worth, I just always thought that you two were... meant to be.
good night.
okay, a toast.
raising a glass is definitely in order, my friend.
actually, as best man, I believe the first toast belongs to me.
go right ahead.
here's to love, when it comes quick, as it did here.
and when it takes a second or two.
here's to family.
the ones we're in, the ones we make.
and here's to a future.
I, for one, can't wait to see what it holds.
hear, hear.
Cheers.
okay. I got to say, that no one was more surprised by the news of this wedding than me.
but Alec is my best friend.
he's been there for me always, and all I want is for him to be happy with his new bride Rebecca.
I just hope that they have the kind of marriage that Kristin and I have.
I'll go.
what are you doing here?
thought you could use the company.
starting with receipts.
from that place you got takeout the night Derek was killed.
changing the timeline. Therefore, disproving her alibi.
good. Except... I mean, people throw away the receipts.
check the computer.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
all right, here, you take these. I'm gonna look on the computer.
whatever you say, Sherlock.
you're obviously upset. Is-Is there something I can do?
I know what you're thinking.
do you? Do you really, Rebecca?
why is it around here, the first thing out of people's mouths is a lie?
is it our city? Our families?
maybe it's the water.
so... yesterday... I guess I slipped up when I said that thing about Ted in-in L. A.
I guess... I guess you did.
Kristin, it was a long time ago, and it was brief, it ended.
it was never supposed to get out. I...
well, then, this exonerates you, right? I mean, that is why you're here, so I can somehow absolve you?
you are absolved.
I hate seeing you this way.
you shouldn't have come back to town.
Hey, hey, hey, let's let the women handle this, okay?
you were supposed to keep Rebecca in line.
I'm losing my wife, my family.
and that's my fault... or Rebecca's?
come on, man. Let's be honest. You screwed this up from the outset.
I never should have listened to you - the lies, the craziness.
Hey, shut up. We got company. Just calm down, okay?
Hey, ladies. - What's going on?
nothing. Nothing. - Where's Mom?
she's okay. She just went to the restroom.
Laurel, Sutton, your mom and dad need to talk about a couple things.
let's go to the... let's go to the table.
come on, I'll walk back with you.
what's going on? Where's Kristin?
I think she's going home.
Oh, my God. Kristin?
Kristin, please!
please? You're leaving? - What does it look like?
whatever she said, whatever Rebecca said, whatever Rebecca...
she has a locket with a picture of you in it. Did you know that?
it doesn't matter. This isn't about the affair.
it's not about Rebecca. It's about the lies.
you made me think it was my fault Justin's mother died, when the whole time... the whole time it was just this affair you were having.
please. Please. - What does it feel like, Ted?
building a family on a mountain of lies - and what is the view like from up there?
cause I'll tell you what. From here, the view sucks.
what is this? - Honey, uh...
mom, you have to tell me what's going on.
Laurel, I don't want you taking this on.
what does that even mean? - She admitted it?
just... just... it doesn't matter anymore.
admitted what? What happened?
somebody tell me.
dad and Rebecca had an affair. A long time ago.
Sutton, no.
Laurel, listen to me.
both of you, I want you to go back in there. I do not want you taking sides.
no. No way. I'm not going back there. I'm not going.
no, me, neither. Come on, Mom, you can't do this alone.
we're coming home with you.
my... my babies.
we work really well together.
make a good team, don't you think?
could you stop doing that Sutton thing?
okay. What exactly is the "Sutton thing"?
doesn't sound very flattering.
it's not.
and let me guess. The Emma thing is all happiness and light and sunshine and bright?
well, she doesn't have to lie to get what she wants.
deep.
God, this woman saves every receipt except for takeout.
how are you doing?
everything's password protected, and we're running out of time.
what about other files?
we're looking for something specific.
Yeah, but snooping is snooping, and if she doesn't clear her history, who knows what we'll find?
look. Downloads right there.
you have way too much experience in this.
no, not that one. Just let me do it.
so, we can check the dates starting with the night Derek was murdered, and then we'll move forward.
look, there's nothing here from that night.
wait. What's this?
it's the only thing downloaded in the last four days.
a jpeg.
Oh, man. Looks like we just hit the jackpot.
Oh, my gosh.
it's all right. Just say it to him.
think I should just...? - I think it's important.
you should know, the last thing... I wanted was...
so, what did you want? I assume Alec here was the grand prize, but what about destroying my life, my marriage, my family?
what should we call it - the consolation prize?
she's being honest with you, man. Give her a chance.
she'll get past this as soon as she realizes that what happened between us was a million years ago.
I know it's not what you want to hear...
but I am sorry. I truly am.
okay? I'm not helping, so, um, I'm gonna go have... a good evening.
see you at home, okay?
why don't you just go, too?
no. I mean, sure I'll go, but you know what? Why don't you think about this for a second?
who had your back... through all of this, okay?
cleaned up your messes, covered your tracks, protected you?
you know what, pal? Why don't you just go straight to hell?
everything you ever did for me just blew up in my face.
you're marrying that woman!
you let her back into my life. Protecting me? No, you... You just screwed me.
that's one way to look at it, yeah.
what is the other way to look at it?
glass is still half full.
Kristin still doesn't know half the secret.
thank you, Ethan.
you have a good night, Ms. Sewell.
I will.
just got your text.
Where's Sutton?
uh, she left with her mom. There was this huge blowout between Ted and Kristin.
what's up?
you guys need to see this.
not you, Riley. Sorry.
it's okay. I get it.
it was on Rebecca's computer.
Oh, my God.
it doesn't matter how I got it.
it proves Alec Rybak killed Derek Rogers.
no. It proves he was on the scene.
he's holding the murder weapon in his hand.
no. Most likely the murder weapon, and I'm guessing that this photo was obtained illegally, which makes it inadmissible in court.
what are you, defending the guy?
after everything we've been through?
no. Ethan, I want to believe it, too, but we need that tire iron, blood, fingerprints, DNA, proof!
in other words, if we move forward too quickly, instead of it blowing up in his face, it blows up in ours, right?
I heard about the photo.
these guys are making it sound like it's a dead end.
anything but.
this is a major step. We're just gonna need a sympathetic judge
someone that's not in love with Alec - so that we can get a search warrant.
we'll see what we can do, okay?
so you and Sutton found this?
look, the only reason I was there was to help solve this thing so you could have a shot at a family.
and you and I could have a second chance.
you know what? I don't mean to sound ungrateful here, but...
Sutton is just always there.
I don't know if it's because she is one step ahead, or one step behind, but she is there, and she is in your head, and under your skin,
Ethan, and... and it is chronic.
chronic?
never goes away.
Yeah, I know what it means.
...you and I are done.
Becca wants me there early.
listen, guys, before I go, there's one part of the ceremony I want to move up.
the "speak now or forever hold your peace" bit.
what do we think?
is the peace gonna hold up?
Yeah, I guess.
maybe not Ted and Kristin.
Maddie, what happened between Ted and Rebecca was... years and years ago.
before you born.
and if I don't have an issue with it... I don't think you should, either.
t, what do you think?
Yeah. No issues.
all right. I'll see you two... at the wedding.
don't be late.
I can't stand this. This is horrible.
that picture and what we know.
I mean, if Dad did kill Derek, and now he's just marrying Rebecca to use her as she's using him...
Mads, I know it's hard, but just try and hang in there a little while longer.
we have to see this through.
I know.
he spent the night at the club.
don't you kids have a wedding to get ready for?
no. What are you talking about? We're not going to that thing.
I mean, right, Sutton?
of course, not.
Sutton, do you mind finishing this?
you're not seriously considering going to that, are you?
I have to.
I kind of figured you'd be getting all dressed up, going to that wedding.
women love weddings, you know.
all that pomp and romance stuff.
be a good chance for you to take another run at her, don't you think?
I'm not going.
I did what I could.
it wasn't enough. It's never gonna be enough.
I see. So what are you gonna do?
you gonna sentence yourself to my life?
and how many years of feeling sorry for yourself were you planning there?
two? Seven, like me?
I just don't care how this thing turns out anymore.
you sit there on your ass, I'll tell you exactly how it's gonna go.
Thayer's gonna get the girl, and you're gonna get squat.
trust me, if I were you, I wouldn't quit at the finish line, pal.
you'll never forgive yourself.
tell Dad I'll be a little late.
Thayer, you're the best man. - I know.
Yeah, best man I know.
Ryan, uh, I will meet you upstairs.
okay. I'll get the car.
Thanks.
okay. I am terrified that people are gonna pick up on what we're suspecting, especially Dad.
you just do your best. I'll handle things here.
okay.
all right. I love you.
I love you, too.
get out of here.
we'll get right to work. This way.
what a pleasant surprise.
I wasn't sure you were gonna come after what happened last night.
well, I just felt like I needed to see this.
I'm glad you're here.
how's your mom and dad?
probably shouldn't talk about it.
totally understand.
do me a favor, though. Give 'em some time.
it'll work out.
thanks for being here.
Hi, kid.
mom doesn't want to see you.
could you just please tell her I'm here?
she saw you pull up. She doesn't want to see you. It's too soon.
honey... I made a mistake.
you have to understand, you and your sister.
all I know is that my mom is hurting really badly right now, and it's your fault.
I'm sorry, Dad.
come in.
Sutton, you're here. Wonderful.
I know, Rebecca. I know all of it, and you... you can't do this.
do... - what, exactly?
cover for Alec.
I know you've seen the picture, and I know you know the truth, that Alec killed Derek Rogers.
that photo is an obvious fake. It's been doctored.
someone's playing a game.
I always assumed it was some malcontent or someone that Alec sent to jail.
or Alec actually killed Derek.
have you ever thought about that possibility?
why would I?
I was with him that whole night at his house, remember?
Yes, his alibi.
his wife-to-be.
is this about your mother and father?
no, Rebecca, this is about you coming forward and telling the truth.
Alec did an awful thing, and if you marry him, he will get away with it.
so I just want you to do the right thing and tell the truth.
Sutton, honey, I am telling the truth.
Hey, honey, I... Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were alone.
no, Sutton and I were just having a little chat.
I'll be right down.
see you at the altar.
okay.
Sutton... do me a favor. Hand me my bouquet.
where you been? Nearly had to call for a replacement. You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
you don't look okay.
Yeah, it's all right. - That's all right. Come on.
well, his car is at the wedding, so, if we don't find anything here, we could try there.
let me see those.
I went through the pockets front and back; nothing.
so Alec's not at the courthouse.
where is he? - Golf course?
exactly.
what we have here?
she says it's a fake, and she is sticking with her alibi.
do you think this is such a good idea?
it's like a puzzle and... these photos are the pieces, but... somehow some of these pieces got mixed up, and I just...
I keep thinking if I can just look at these pictures long enough, it'll start to make sense.
...for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do us part.
therefore, by the power vested in me by the state of Arizona,
I pronounce you husband and wife.
you may kiss the bride.
Danny, what's going on?
you're under arrest for the murder of Derek Rogers.
if you'll come with us, please.
do you know about this?
we found the murder weapon in your house; your prints were all over it. Let's go.
this is ridiculous. - You might want to call his attorney.
let's go! - Tell them I was set up!
you okay?
I just wasn't expecting for it to feel like this.
I know. I can imagine.
any regrets?
not yet.
but whatever's coming, I don't want to face it alone.
you won't have to.
Hey, mom.
it's all working perfectly, Sutton.
a few months ago, I discovered I had a twin sister.
and then she she asked me to take her place, keep the secret, find our real mother and try to stay alive.
put yourself in my shoes.
how long could you keep up the lying game?
all I had to do was get a tire iron and drop it into Mr. Rybak's bag.
frame himself for murder?
why would he do that? - To throw us off.
I knew Dad was innocent.
and you never listened because he's not your real father.
what will it take to make this right?
and if you were to promise me right now that you have told me everything.
I swear you know everything.
I want you to work things out with Kristin.
and I'd like to be there for you.
I hooked up with Jordan. Now, it turns out he's my new stepbrother.
you should really think about going solo.
it looks really good on you.
Thayer has always been there for me.
you and Sutton are perfect for each other.
so, it's cool if Ethan and I give in to the chemistry between us?
Yeah.
what took you so long?
crap.
morning, sleepyhead.
God, what did I do? - Me.
several times, actually.
don't you remember?
I was really drunk.
ow, I wasn't thinking.
um, we've both know we've been thinking about doing that for a while now.
it was only a matter of time. - I never should've come here.
what are you doing? I thought we'd spend the day together.
I've got school.
well, you had a good time last night though, didn't you?
that's not the point, okay?
it was a mistake, Sutton.
can I have my shirt back?
this is because of Emma, isn't it?
I'm... I'm just really sorry about the whole thing, okay?
well, you didn't seem to be too sorry last night.
I... I know... y... you're right.
and that just was not fair to you.
I realize that and, um...
I promise it won't happen again.
you really shouldn't have left the party so early.
you still had guests to entertain.
like Laurel Mercer?
admit it: she's just a way for you to get closer to her dad.
maybe, but I'd play along if I were you.
cause it be a real shame if some of your past mistakes were to come to light.
wouldn't it?
you know what? We can talk about this later.
cause you're late for school.
I hate it when you get parental on me.
how many times do I have to tell you?
I'm sorry, but this is an emergency.
I slept with Ethan.
that's not an emergency.
unless, of course, you didn't use protection?
no, I did.
he freaked out this morning.
and told me that he wished it didn't happen.
I'm so sorry, Sutton. Boys can be so cruel.
this is her fault.
if I could just get rid of Emma, Ethan will forget about her.
she's your sister.
someday we're going to be a family again. And you need to get along with her.
he's holding out hope for her.
just like your father.
holding out hope for Kristin.
amazing how you can make my problems all about you.
the truth is, you could learn by my example.
Ted and I kind of had a moment last night.
yay for you.
yay for you too.
if you follow my lead.
I don't give up so easily, and neither should you.
all right, thanks for the ride, man.
no problem.
where the hell you been all night?
screwing up like usual. You know?
I had to hitch a ride.
you're damn right you screwed up.
your teacher called. Mr. Beattie?
you plagiarize a paper?
sounds like you already know the answer to that.
Yeah, he ran it through some software. Found out it was bought online.
Dan, I know I shouldn't have done that, okay? - Save it, Ethan.
I can't let you go back to juvie.
so I got Beattie to give you a second chance.
you're going to take an exam on all the coursework.
it's real simple: you pass the test, you pass the course.
okay, thanks.
when is the test?
tomorrow morning.
it's tomorrow morning?
how am I going to pass a test tomorrow morning?
I don't know, but you better figure it out because your whole life depends on it.
what happened to your eye?
I'm just making friends.
everybody in jail loves the D. A.
let me get this straight.
Dan, our Dan, came up with this crazy theory that I'm trying to frame myself?
you know it makes more sense than your own theory.
after all, it was a man who called the waitress to set you up.
Rebecca could've done that. She could've hired someone.
or... you made the call yourself.
I thought you were trying to represent me here.
the objective was to get me out of jail.
whose side are you on?
when you hired me, you told me that if you could convince me of your innocence, you could convince a jury too.
well... I'm not as convinced as I used to be.
pull the waitress's phone records.
that'll prove I didn't make the call.
Dan's already on it.
should have them this afternoon.
you know, Theresa, you really ought to keep your eye on the ball.
Rebecca's pulling the strings on this one.
not me.
I heard the strange ringtone and I found this hidden in the garage.
a cell phone? - Yeah.
I thought the police already searched your whole house.
well, I know, it's weird that they didn't find it, but it's got to be my dad's, so I have to turn it in.
no, hold on, we need to check it and see who he called.
I already did.
all incoming calls were blocked.
and if he made any calls out, he cleared the log.
can't you hack into it and see what he deleted?
but that might be considered tampering with evidence.
Thayer, this is going to be our only way we're gonna know what he's been up to all this time.
please? Can you just try?
okay.
thank you.
you're welcome.
aren't they adorable?
I can't believe they finally got together.
she's coming. Uh, act natural.
Oh, hi.
Hey, how's everything? - Hey.
everything is fine.
were you spying on me?
us?
no.
just came in here to brush my hair.
with my brush?
okay, we were totally spying.
Oh, my God. You and Thayer... this is awesome.
way to hold firm, Laurel.
Mads, you should've come out and talked to him.
especially after what happened last night.
well, his lips seemed pretty busy just now.
so, I figured I'd do it later.
okay, listen, not to make this all about me, but I need to ask you guys a question.
what do you think about me asking Jordan out?
okay... terrible idea.
no...
how well do you know him?
what? You think he's out of my league?
no, of course not.
I just think that... - I think you guys'd be great together.
you should totally go for it. No reason not to.
this is disgusting!
what is this? God!
what's going on? - Are you okay?
well, the sink is clogged.
EW, well, maybe Dad could fix it.
no, I don't want to have to rely on him right now. I can take care of this myself.
but I thought therapy went well.
that doesn't mean we are getting back together.
have you tried the disposal? Maybe that'll clear it?
that is a very good idea.
you see, girls? We can handle this ourselves.
Oh, my God.
I'll call a plumber.
dude.
you and Sutton Mercer back together again, huh?
look, I might've seen her when I dropped you at the cabin.
I mean, that girl moves fast. - Nothing happened, okay?
no, like literally fast. Like The Flash.
you know, she was at the party one minute, then the cabin the next.
she must've taken a shortcut.
so, she races down there for a secret rendezvous, and you guys don't even hook up?
come on, you don't really expect me to believe that, do you?
jordan, you need to keep your mouth shut. All right?
you didn't see anything. Got it?
got it.
she wasn't there.
and she's definitely not down the hall either.
ladies.
he was totally checking you out.
EW, he's my stepbrother.
regardless, you have to tell Laurel that you hooked up with him.
you heard her this morning. She was talking about asking him out.
it was a meaningless one-time thing, and we've agreed never to speak about it again.
it's like it didn't even happen.
but it did happen.
I'm late for Bio.
cleaning out?
dropping out, actually.
beattie found out I plagiarized that World Civ paper.
so, now I'm history.
not that it's any your business.
well, won't you go back to juvie.
well, maybe that's where I belong.
no, Ethan, there has to be something you can do.
Yeah, there's a test I'd have to pass tomorrow on all the course material, but I can't do that because I'm too far behind, which is why I cheated in the first place.
wait.
what?
I'll tutor you.
why do you even care?
after everything I did.
aren't you with Thayer now?
Oh, come on. This has nothing to do with him.
this is about your future. You can't just give up.
please, just let me help you.
later.
excuse me.
let me help.
Oh, my gosh, I'm such a klutz.
maybe they should put warning labels on these things.
you're hilarious.
Hey, look, I know this is really short notice, but DJ Beat Baron is spinning tonight at Hangar 19.
and I was thinking of going.
would you want to come?
I didn't even know that Beat Baron was in town.
his mixes are so sick.
so, you in?
Yeah, for sure.
pick up around 7: 00? - It's a date.
I mean, a date in the calendar sense of the word.
right.
all right, I'll see you then. - Okay.
Mads, I thought you said you wanted to apologize.
I am apologizing.
for last night, but not for thinking Dad's innocent.
I told you, he said... - I don't care what he said.
he's playing you just like he plays everyone.
guys?
everything okay?
Yeah, fine.
no, it's not fine.
Rebecca, tell him about the fingerprint they found on the golf bag.
they can prove that Dad's been set up, just like he's been saying all along.
well, I didn't want to get anybody's hopes up, but things are looking a lot better now.
well, I wouldn't pop that champagne just yet.
excuse me, guys. I have work to do.
wait. We weren't finished talking. - Thayer, stay.
why don't we all go to dinner together? My treat.
Sutton and I are playing tennis tonight. She has regionals coming up.
sorry.
see you.
he just won't listen.
Oh, he'll come around.
Mads, it's you that I'm actually worried about.
between all of this, your dad being in jail, living at the Mercers while they're going through divorce.
well, Ted and Kristin are actually in therapy now.
so, things seem better.
Really? - Yeah.
that's so good to hear.
Oh, good, you made it. I didn't think you would get here so...
wait a second.
I told the girls specifically not to call you.
Really?
cause Laurel made it sound like you were practically begging me to come over.
did they clog the drain too?
wouldn't put it past them... our girls.
pretty crafty.
Aww, what is this?
lamb chops, some kind of fish, chicken.
what are you thinking, piccata?
Parmigiana.
kill for a home-cooked meal, not that I'm hinting at anything.
don't you think it's a little early for that?
right.
speaking of which, I spoke to Dr. Sandy's office.
she said she has a time for us Monday at 10: 00?
I actually have another appointment at that time.
and I'm not... I'm not sure that I want to cancel it, so...
no pressure, that's fine.
just let me know.
I have to rent a rooter for this, so can you wait till tomorrow?
sure.
the call to Jessica Whitman was made from a burner cell, so chances are it's been destroyed by now.
in other words, anyone could've called her, including Alec.
which is why I called his secretary to check his schedule that day.
and from that look, I'm guessing you found something.
he took off early.
was gone all afternoon. Didn't say where.
huh. That's interesting. - Yeah.
I'm so sorry. I have to bail on you for tennis. Something came up.
well, whatever it is, it should wait because I found out who my dad called with that cell phone.
apparently, he made one call to a Jessica Whitman.
number's been disconnected, but I figured we could work together and try and find her.
I can't tonight.
but... but you can do it without me.
I'll call you later, okay?
wait, they're getting along now?
I thought they hated each other.
that was during the Seven Years' War.
after World War I, France and England were allies.
well, how am I supposed to keep this stuff straight if even they can't decide who likes who?
this is worse than high school.
maybe if you just focus and put the ball down.
I am focused. I really am.
but I am focusing on how this is going to be a huge waste of my time.
you're right.
I can't teach you if you don't want to learn.
so have fun in juvie.
all right, wait, wait. Hang on a second, okay?
I just feel like I don't deserve this.
what? - Your help.
you made a mistake, Ethan.
and now you have a chance to make it right.
Ethan, I believe in you.
Emma, I have to tell you something.
I...
well, hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Sutton, are you crazy?
Oh, would you relax? I checked to make sure Dan was still at work.
I was stopping by to see if Ethan wanted to join me for dinner, but, apparently, he has plans.
it's not what you think, all right? I've... I've got a test tomorrow.
we're... we're studying. She's helping me.
Oh, well, that's really sweet. I approve.
Seriously?
Yes, seriously, we don't want lover boy to end up back in juvie now, do we?
lover boy?
Oh, come on. It's a figure of speech.
we really have a lot of work to do right now.
okay, well, then I will leave you these.
just for a little snack. For later.
it's from that favorite barbeque place you like.
good luck tomorrow.
he doesn't need luck.
he has me.
you should have seen her. Playing all innocent.
I'm telling you that if I would have stayed there,
Alec wouldn't be the only one in jail for murder.
you're going to be a lot happier after you hear what I have to say.
what could you possibly say that would make me feel better?
I want you...
to take your life back from Emma.
since when is switching back ever been part of the plan?
it's just there's only so much I can do to keep Ted and Kristin apart.
so, you want me to work from the inside to split them up?
well, think about it this way:
Emma will be here in isolation, while you're out and about, which means you'll have Ethan all to yourself.
you know she's not going to do this willingly you're going to have to find a way to persuade her.
don't let me down, pumpkin.
Hi.
am I at the right house?
Yeah, I'm just staying here for a little bit. Come on in.
Laurel, uh, should be ready in a minute.
sorry, I didn't realize you'd be here.
guess this is kind of awkward.
why would it be awkward?
gotcha.
all set. Thanks for entertaining him.
Yeah, not a problem. You two have fun.
Hey, do you want to come?
uh, I can't. I don't want to impose.
are you kidding? We're just hanging out.
but I thought... - No, you should come.
it's not like it's a date or anything.
jordan, can you give us a sec?
okay, now you have to come with us.
no, I'm so not in the mood.
you were the one who told me to ask him out, and now I'm totally confused.
if you come along, you can help me figure out whether or not he's really into me or not.
please?
fine. For the record... - She's in. Let's roll.
not a word.
you left work early the day that call to Jessica Whitman was made.
the only thing I'm guilty of is leaving work early to play some golf.
and before you say anything, you're not allowed to have cell phones on the golf course, okay?
we should get out next week. What do you say? You free?
she is. You aren't.
Oh, think again, Danny Boy.
I've got a witness that'll back me up.
you two just gave me a get-out-of-jail-free card.
Hey, sis. You were out late.
Oh, you scared the crap out of me, Sutton.
Hey, you know, you should really get these re-strung every now and then.
what do you think you're doing? You can't go play tennis.
you're supposed to be staying out of sight.
and you're supposed to be practicing for regionals, but that doesn't seem to stop you from going over to Ethan's and tutoring him.
I knew you were upset about that.
Oh, I'm not upset.
I'm thrilled that you're helping him.
I just don't want to lose regionals either.
you know, a lot is riding on it:
a chance to play D-1 tennis, and scholarship.
since when has any of that mattered to you?
since I had a lot of time to think up at that cabin.
and the fact of the matter is, you and I are both going to have to go to college someday.
well, don't worry. I'm ready for the tournament.
and I'm gonna win the scholarship.
Yeah, but a little bit of practice wouldn't hurt.
so, I was thinking, I can just give you some pointers.
we go out tomorrow. Just for fun.
someone will see us, Sutton.
then, we'll do it across town. No one will recognize us.
what is the big deal?
why is this so important to you?
geez, just thought I'd spend some quality time with my sister, but if you're not interested.
no.
actually, I would love to.
you're on, sis.
thanks for coming down.
actually, I was already planning on talking to you.
about what?
well, you first. You said it was important.
well, we need you to make a statement. Some new evidence has come to light.
someone called a waitress at the club and paid her to plant the tire iron in your father's golf bag.
wait. Somebody called? - Yeah.
what was the waitress's name?
whoever called her set your father up, Thayer.
Oh, my God. Dan, he wasn't set up. He's the one who called.
Hello, T.
what the hell? - It's okay, Thayer.
we just need to ask you some questions.
well, I've got some questions of my own.
like...
how do you explain this, for example?
dad?
how can you say you've never seen that phone before? I found it in our house.
if it was there the whole time, why didn't the police find it when they searched the house?
they must have missed it. - Come on.
look, whoever planted the phone there, planted it there after the search.
and then they called it to be sure you'd find it.
or maybe you just screwed up.
and you didn't hide it as well as you think you did.
I'm no fool, son.
but you're a murderer. - Okay, that's enough.
this isn't getting us anywhere.
I got the lab results. Our techs confirmed that...
it is indeed the cell phone used to call Jessica Whitman.
Ouch. Case closed.
they also determined that the call to Jessica...
was made from Flagstaff, Arizona.
weren't we playing golf the exact time that phone call was made?
Yeah, it was a Friday, right?
I remember it 'cause you beat me by one... you birdied 18.
I know. I remember.
so how could I be playing golf with you in Scottsdale, and also be in Flagstaff, 150 miles away?
I don't know. Maybe you hired someone.
or maybe there's two of me.
well, it backfired.
cause we got enough to go to the judge and get the charges against you dropped.
Oh, my God. No, no, no, please, please, you can't let him out.
t, face it... You were wrong about everything, and the only mistake I made was taking your bastard ass in when nobody else gave a crap about you.
okay, okay... - Let's go. Let's go.
let's go.
damn it. This can't be happening right now.
you dad's getting out whether you like it or not.
you need to find a way to deal with that.
now go home and cool off.
Hi, this is Lindsey Ridgeway's office reminding you of your appointment for Monday at 10: 00 a. m.
please call us back to confirm.
you're still going to meet with your divorce attorney?
I don't know.
maybe.
it turns out we have a therapy session the exact same time, so I do have to cancel one of them.
do I get a vote on which one?
Oh, I already know your vote, thank you very much, and don't think I don't know what you girls were up to with the whole plumbing thing.
you are not as clever as you think you are.
the point is, we would do anything to keep this family intact.
and canceling on the divorce attorney is hardly going to extremes.
I like this place.
what do you think, Mads?
I think there's too many people trying too hard to be cool, but I'm not surprised you like it.
excuse me?
she's just kidding.
you were just kidding, right?
Yes, and you would know, Laurel, because you have an amazing sense of humor, - an infectious laugh, great personality... - Stop.
some might say that she is the total package.
well, don't sell yourself short.
well, thank you, stepbrother.
I'm gonna go to the bar. Anyone want a drink?
sure. You want any help?
no. You stay here with Laurel. I'll get the drinks.
well, at least let me buy. - I really don't want your money.
Hey, I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong?
ha! There she goes again.
Hey, I'll just take a water. If that's cool.
What're you gonna drink, Mads?
a Cosmo? Sex on the beach?
you know what? I'm gonna go home.
he's all yours. You two enjoy your evening.
um, I'm really sorry. I have no idea what just happened.
forget about it. It's fine.
let's dance.
Thanks.
Hi. - You playing today?
no, I was just warming up.
I'm actually headed across town to have a match with Sutton.
Seriously? - Mm-hmm. It was her idea.
I'm sure she has some sort of ulterior motive.
you guys are gonna just be alone together?
Yes, we're gonna be alone together.
I can't wait to hear what she has on her mind.
how did your test go?
uh, 73. I passed.
that's awesome.
Yeah, well, I had a pretty good tutor.
you think you might want to keep helping me with that stuff?
so I can stay a free man.
Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.
all right. Thanks.
come here.
I'm so happy for you.
what's going on here?
um, I was just thanking her for helping me.
uh, she tutored me.
tutoring you?
Yeah. I thought you knew.
uh, no, actually.
wait, hold on. So last night... that's where you had to go?
the test was today.
you know what? It doesn't matter.
Alec is getting out?
the judge is signing off on it now.
it's obvious that he was framed.
of course. By whom?
well, the call to the waitress came from Flagstaff, Arizona.
does that mean anything to you?
no. Not at all.
anyway, he should be out by this evening. You two should celebrate.
Yes, I thought this day would never come.
thank you so much, Theresa.
Hey, Ted,
I just got the most amazing news.
Really? What?
Alec's being released.
Really? - Yeah.
Wow. That... I didn't expect that.
neither was I.
actually.
well why are you so upset?
I'm scared, Ted.
it's just whenever I've gone to see Alec in jail,
I've gotten the feeling that he might blame me for his arrest.
well, that's ridiculous. You've been more supportive than anyone.
Yeah, well... you know how he gets.
his temper.
well, if you are that afraid, why don't you leave town?
go back to L. A?
you don't really mean that?
I thought that... - You thought wrong.
I see.
well, I can't...
run away, not again.
I mean, everything I love is here.
my roots are here. My family is here.
you mean Jordan?
who else would I mean?
well, I'm, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have fallen apart on you like this.
and I thank you for being there for me.
see ya.
this is Thayer, you know what to do.
Thayer, hi. It's Emma again.
are you okay? Please call me back.
trouble in paradise?
are you sure nobody's gonna recognize us here?
please, anyone worth knowing wouldn't be caught dead here.
all right. You serve.
I'm sure you haven't played in a while.
always so considerate, Emma.
well, care to make things interesting?
well, what did you have in mind?
well, whoever wins is obviously the best player, so she should be the one that plays at regionals.
so that's what this is about.
you want to switch back.
for a few days. Just for regionals.
unless, of course, you're too scared, then... you don't have to.
Oh, I'm not scared. You should be scared, 'cause I will wipe these courts with you.
feisty, Emma.
fine. We have a deal?
no, actually, I have some of my own terms.
whoever loses... has to stay in the cabin.
for real this time.
can't step foot out of it. Understand?
deal.
good luck.
may the best sister win.
Oh, I will.
Oh, hey.
I wanted to apologize for last night. I, I guess I kind of screwed things up.
Oh, no. Leaving was the best thing you could've done.
I never should've asked you to come along.
Oh, so things worked out with you and Jordan?
we danced for a while and talked for, like, hours about music and bands and life.
he's so sweet and cute.
I think we're gonna go out again next week.
awesome. Well, I'm really happy for you.
me, too.
you're the best.
Hey, Thayer. What's up?
what?
that's me on the first set. 6-2.
you're on fire.
well, we can quit if you want.
no, no. I'm just a little off.
haven't really been getting much sleep this week.
that's 'cause you're running around town when you should be up at that cabin just relaxing.
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard to relax when Ethan just drops by in the middle of the night.
excuse me.
after Jordan's party, he stopped by, and you said it was fine, so I slept with him.
you're cool with that, right?
Yeah, whatever. He can...
he can do what he wants.
good, 'cause I totally thought you'd be, like, really upset.
I'm not.
obviously.
my serve.
the, um, the cam, um...
chain tensioner. - Yeah, that's the one.
do you mind taking a look at it?
all right.
Sutton's not here, is she?
why would she be?
just asking.
never seem to know where she's gonna pop up next.
it didn't sound like your tensioner, but, um, we're probably gonna check your plugs out, all right?
what's the deal with you guys anyways?
look, it's, uh... it's complicated.
okay, she used to be one person and...
now she's someone else.
and you don't know which one you like more.
something like that, yeah. - Chicks.
even when you know they're completely wrong for you, you still can't stop thinking about them.
sounds to me like you're the one with the problem.
Yeah, tell me about it.
but hey, I did see Sutton at the cabin.
she's into you, man. Like, hardcore into you.
if I were you, I wouldn't overthink it.
if I were you, I wouldn't either.
damn.
Mads? Time-out.
thank God I found you.
what's the matter?
Thayer just called to say good-bye. He's moving back to L. A.
I guess things got pretty ugly between him and my dad.
Oh, I knew something was wrong with him.
Uh-oh. Drama.
I really wanted to make peace between them, but he won't listen to me, and Emma, I think you might be the only person who can keep him here.
and you've got to hurry 'cause he's packing right now.
Tick-tock.
congratulations, Sutton.
you win. I forfeit.
you shouldn't have come, Emma.
I don't understand. What happened with Alec?
he won, like he always does.
he's getting out of jail, so I can't stay here anymore.
what, he's getting out? How?
that phone I found exonerated him. Can you believe that?
okay...
well, you don't have to leave.
I mean, you could stay someplace else.
Emma, I don't really live here.
I only came back to help you and Sutton, but every single time I do, it always leads back to my father, and I can't, I can't beat him.
it's killing me.
I'm sorry.
you know what, the truth is, there is nothing left for me here anymore.
what about me?
I'm... I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Ethan, but...
it's not about that.
I want you to come with me.
uh... Thayer, I can't do that.
the Mercers are the only family I've ever known.
I can't leave them right now.
well, I can't... I can't stay either.
so then that's it?
maybe it's for the best.
no, I... I...
take care of yourself.
see? Good as new.
guess I'll just get out of your way.
Ted, about that counseling session on Monday.
I'll be there.
what about your other appointment?
I canceled it.
that's good to hear, but I hope you brought your checkbook, ma'am, 'cause you've rung up quite a hefty plumbing bill.
chicken parmigiana?
leftovers.
looks like everything is getting back to normal around here.
Yes, your father fixed the drain.
I wasn't talking about the plumbing.
do you want me to get Laurel?
you know, honestly, I can't figure you out.
one minute, you're hot; the next minute, you're cold.
do you even know what you want?
what about you? You're practically stalking me.
I am not interested, okay?
Oh, is that right? - Yeah.
well, I love the smell of freedom in the evening.
the press is at the other entrance, just like you requested.
perfect. There'll be plenty of time for grandstanding later.
do you need a lift home?
no.
I've got a stop to make.
tell my wife I'm coming for her.
you were in Flagstaff?
you were supposed to make that call from the golf course so no one would question it.
no, I don't want you to do anything.
Alec will be here any minute.
I know exactly how to handle him.
Hey, baby, I'm home.
darling, I've missed you so much.
I'll bet.
Sutton! - God, you scare easily.
well, what do you expect? There's a murderer out there.
Hey, so, I'm really sorry about the Thayer thing.
tough break, but a deal's a deal.
and if you remember, not one foot outside of the cabin.
your terms, I recall.
and what if I refuse?
you wouldn't dare.
try me.
shoot. I was afraid this would happen.
see, I'm not going to go either, so...
I think we're gonna just have to tell the family our big secret, which is going to be really tough because
Kristin, I don't really know how she's going to react.
she's very fragile right now.
you're bluffing.
try me.
fine. I'm leaving, but Ted and Kristin are making really good progress, so just promise me that you'll keep pushing them in the right direction.
Yes! Of course! They're my parents.
you think I don't want them together?
all right, I'll see you in a couple days.
I left some clean towels for you at the cabin.
you may need them.
see, I can be considerate too, Emma.
good luck at regionals.
Oh, I don't need luck.
a few months ago, I discovered I had a twin sister.
and then she asked me to take her place, keep the secret, find our real mother and try to stay alive.
put yourself in my shoes.
how long could you keep up the lying game?
I'm not interested. - Oh, is that right?
you said it was fine, so I slept with him.
it was a mistake, Sutton.
Ted, about the therapy session on Monday, I'll be there.
I'm so happy for you.
what's going on here?
I was just thanking her for tutoring me.
you know what? It doesn't matter.
care to make things interesting? - You want to switch back?
whoever loses has to stay in the cabin.
that phone I found exonerated him. I can't beat him.
the only mistake I made was taking your bastard ass in.
there is nothing left for me here anymore. - What about me?
tough break, but a deal's a deal.
I left some clean towels for you at the cabin.
I've gotten the feeling that he might blame me for his arrest.
Hey, baby, I'm home.
good morning, sunshine.
uh, what are you doing? - Just watching you sleep. I missed that.
well, isn't that romantic?
I've been in prison for a while.
I can't believe I'm actually here with you.
well... was it worth the wait? - You tell me.
so, your first day as a free man. What are your plans?
Oh, well, that sounds great, but...
where are we gonna go on such short notice?
as it turns out, I got a little spot I know about.
a little bed and breakfast? - Hmm.
a five-star resort and spa?
now, it wouldn't be a surprise if I told you, would it?
Oh, well, come on, just a little hint.
please tell me.
this is Thayer. You know what to do.
Hey, it's me again.
I tried your cell and you didn't answer, so I'm trying you here.
I just want to know that you're okay. I hate the way we left things.
please call me.
Thayer? - Nope, it's me.
I wanted to see how your night at the cabin was.
you're checking on me?
well, of course, you're my sister.
Plus, I know how lonely it can get there.
Yeah, I can't argue with that.
but it's just for a few days, right?
we're switching back after tennis regionals.
that was the deal.
anyway, I'm calling because I wanted to make sure about you sleeping with Ethan? I told you, it's fine.
Really? - Yes, sleep with whomever you want.
just promise me you won't do anything to rock the boat with Ted and Kristin.
if you haven't noticed, they're getting along better now.
I get it, Emma. You have my word.
and, in fact, I think you'll find that I am going to be a sweeter, nicer version of myself than you.
do you have a sec?
you have nothing to worry about. I have to go.
what's up?
I wanted to talk to you about what happened last night.
what happened last night?
when I saw Jordan kissing Mads outside?
Oh, right, yeah, that... that was rough.
I thought things were going so well between me and Jordan, and then Mads just totally goes behind my back...
okay, look, Laurel.
what you need to remember is that Jordan Lyle is a worldly, older, dangerously sexy guy who, let's face it, is way out of your league.
if I remember correctly, the other day, you said he'd be lucky to have me.
and clearly you blew it, so I think you should move on.
I mean, go for some lower hanging fruit like a sophomore.
or one of those guys in the clubs in the back of the yearbook.
I... I don't get it.
I know, I know.
love... it's very confusing.
I'm hungry for breakfast, though. I'm thinking tofu scramble?
Hi, Dad.
what are you doing here? - Hi, kiddo.
your father has some news. - What is it?
well, remember all that pro bono work I was doing at the burn clinic last summer?
turns out I was just named Phoenix Surgical Humanitarian of the Year.
that's awesome.
is there, like, some kind of ceremony or something?
Yeah, the banquet's tomorrow.
originally I was gonna go myself, but then, since they're giving me this award, I was kind of hoping...
well, of course, we'll be there.
there's one more thing.
they usually ask the recipient's significant other to say a few words before the presentation.
so I guess the committee doesn't know about our situation?
actually, I was going to mention it, but then I thought things were going pretty well between us, so...
I know it's a lot to spring on you.
maybe we can discuss it during family therapy tomorrow.
maybe.
great. I'll see you then.
Bye.
Bye, Dad. - Bye, hon.
Bye.
well, that was awkward.
we are going, right, Mom?
of course, of course.
but, I mean, for me to be giving a speech is...
mom, please, it would mean so much to him.
and you guys have been doing better.
well, yes, in the sense that we can be in the same room without fighting.
no, why don't Laurel and I do it?
Really? - Mm-hmm.
I mean, sure, yeah, we can do it.
sweetie, it's short notice. Do you have time to prepare a speech?
for a bunch of nerdy doctors? Yeah.
Plus, I already know what I'm going to say.
Mads, I wasn't expecting you.
uh, because I'm not here to see you.
Hey, is this about last night?
cause until Laurel had her little meltdown, you and I were getting pretty hot and...
I'm not here to discuss that.
okay, why are you here? - Maddie?
Hi, honey. - Hi.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you. - Me, too.
you good? - Yes.
Mr. Rybak, we didn't get a chance to meet last night.
I'm Jordan Lyle. - Jordan.
Rebecca's stepson. - Yes, sir.
you can call me Alec. - All right.
I see you two have already met? - Barely.
we've bumped into each other a couple times, yeah.
well, glad you're acquainted.
Maddie, since I've moved in here with Rebecca, I was kind of hoping you might think about doing the same.
Really?
that's an interesting idea, sir.
we'll see.
it's good to see that everybody's getting to know each other.
honey, did you tell them about our honeymoon plans?
honeymoon?
um, yeah...
Sutton? What are you doing here?
well, the door was open, so...
so you just walked in?
well, my godfather is back and I was just so excited to see him.
well, you're kind of interrupting a family moment.
so let me show you out.
okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I was walking into the Bizarro family reunion back there.
why are you freaking out?
I'm not freaking out.
you were being careless.
fine, I screwed up, but I'm just really excited to tell you what happened this morning.
what? - My dad's getting this award...
what award? - I don't know. I wasn't really listening.
maybe for giving homeless people free boob jobs or something?
anyway, he asked Kristin to introduce him at the ceremony.
she said no. Guess who offered to speak instead.
excellent. - Mm-hmm, and get this: we're going to family therapy.
and don't worry, I already know what I'm going to say.
okay, even so, I want you to run it by me first.
our plan is moving to the next phase, and I don't want to leave anything to chance.
call me later.
okay.
look, if you want to take a break, we...
no, let's just keep going. We have a ton of chemistry to do left.
okay.
Emma, I just want you to know that I, I appreciate you still tutoring me.
cause I know you're probably going through a lot with Thayer leaving.
Ethan, let's not do this.
what?
I'm... I'm just trying to be a friend here.
you're not my friend.
and I may be helping you study here, but I don't want to discuss Thayer any more than I want to talk about what happened with you and Sutton.
of course.
she told you that we slept together after Jordan's party.
it's not my business.
then, why are you acting like it is?
because I used to think you were better than that.
what are they doing here?
Oh, crap.
Alec, I know you wanted to surprise me, but this place?
what are we, hillbillies?
hurry, grab everything. They can't know we were here.
all right. All right.
is this yours? - Doesn't matter, just take it.
damn it.
here, give me a towel, quick.
here, take this.
Oh, hurry, hurry, hurry.
your keys.
got it. Got it.
what?
I...
I'm sorry.
I'm a little rusty.
come here.
I had no idea you were so old-fashioned.
Oh, well, there's more surprises where that came from.
that sounds good.
look, flat screen.
are they on their honeymoon?
I guess.
Oh, my God, what if they start getting naked?
Ted bought this place when they were still in diapers.
now you couldn't pay 'em to come up here.
Oh, well, I'm sure I will come to love it.
after all, you brought me up here for some reason.
I'm sure I'll figure out what that is.
why don't I give you the grand tour?
she saw us. - No, she didn't.
Yes, she did. She looked right at me.
wait, w... wait, slow down, cowboy.
I'm not done with you in this room.
we have to go.
let's go. There's a window.
Laurel, come on, I want to apologize for last night, all right?
I don't want it to be weird between us.
hmm, think it's late for that, don't you?
well, it doesn't have to be.
when you invited me to the club the other night, I didn't know that was a date.
all right, that's my bad.
look, you're very pretty, all right?
I'm pretty? - Yeah.
okay, look, Jordan, any misguided feelings I might have briefly had for you are definitely over, so you can save your patronizing compliments.
that's fair enough.
anything else?
all right, let me tell you what.
let's go grab some breakfast, and you can yell at me all you want.
what do you say? - I say, have fun kissing your stepsister, creep.
well, I didn't see that one coming.
Yeah, Alec honeymooning at the cabin.
I kind of figured him for a Turks and Caicos kind of guy.
you gonna be okay here? - Yeah.
this is the hotel that Sutton stayed when her car went into the lake.
you want me to come inside with you?
no. I'm fine. Thanks.
so this means tutoring is out, I guess?
no.
believe it or not, I don't want to see you go back to juvie. So... just meet me back here later.
we'll finish our session.
Thanks.
Hi, I need a room, please.
it's you. - I'm sorry?
you owe me money.
I do owe you money from the last time I was here.
what was the bill again?
you know, this isn't about the bill. I did you a favor.
when that guy came in asking questions, you paid me to lie and say you were in that room alone.
right.
alone, well, I... I was with that woman.
that woman. You mean women. - What?
you really did take a knock on the head that night.
girly, there were two women with you in that room.
two women? - Yeah, two.
so, where's my 80 bucks?
I got to say, this crappy motel room isn't exactly the ideal place for studying Faulkner.
Yeah.
maybe if we talk louder, the hookers next door will learn something.
Hey, maybe that's them now.
Sutton, what are you doing here?
what does it look like I'm doing here?
Ethan gave me a little hint about your cram session.
so I thought I'd hit the books.
Really?
you're here to study?
well, yeah, thanks to you, Sutton Mercer has a hefty GPA to maintain, so...
and studying is all that's going on here, right?
what do you think?
anyway, you know, I figured you'd be pretty busy working on your speech.
what speech? - Oh, it's nothing.
just some stupid awards thing for my dad.
being here brings back so many memories, which is surprising, considering I had a head wound last time I was here.
Yeah, funny you should say that, because when I was checking in, the desk clerk said something kind of weird to me.
well, he's weird.
what did he say?
he said that when you were here, Annie wasn't the only person with you.
someone else was here.
did he now?
well, he was so busy hitting on me that night that he couldn't have possibly noticed who I was with.
who did he think he saw?
he didn't say.
but anyway, you're right.
he... creeped me out, too.
this is nice.
cloth napkins, candlelight.
it's from Celine, your favorite spot.
well, you really did think of everything.
it's a very special wine.
I've been saving it for a very special occasion.
I think tonight might just be that night.
let's celebrate like tonight is our last night on Earth.
you know, one of the things we never talked about is what you did the whole time I was gone.
I mean, that must have been tough for you, having your new husband locked up.
it was.
they were the hardest days of my life. - I'll bet.
did you ever wonder if I was ever getting out of there?
now, why would I?
you're an innocent man.
I have faith in the system.
although there was this one moment.
Oh, it's nothing.
we were both under a lot of stress.
there was this one time that I went to see you in jail, and... I... could have thought that you... thought that I was somehow... behind framing you for Derek's murder.
that's crazy talk.
and we both know you were my rock, you know, through the whole thing.
of course. - Plus, if I thought you were framing me about anything, I don't think we'd be sitting here drinking an $800 bottle of wine.
I'd be outside, burying you in the woods.
not if I buried you first.
Touche.
Hey, girlie, hold up.
can I help you? - Actually, I was thinking I could help you.
you know how earlier you couldn't remember how there were two ladies with you that night you were here?
Yes.
my mind was blank, but yes.
so, to jog your memory, I, put together a couple sketches of the women you were with.
so what do you think?
I think you're a very talented artist, Carl.
correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't our deal that, if I won our tennis match, you stay hidden until after regionals?
actually, the deal was that I stay in the cabin, which is now full of middle-aged honeymooners.
here.
what is this?
it's a speech.
I was thinking about Ted's awards banquet, and I just thought I'd help.
that's really sweet of you, Emma, but I have it covered. Thank you.
are you sure?
because this is huge, Sutton.
I mean, the family is going to be together, and Ted and Kristin are in such a precarious place.
I said no.
Laurel, wait!
what's going on?
look who finally decided to do her hair today.
what are you doing? What do you want?
okay, I can't believe I'm actually about to say this, but I wanted to thank you for the advice you gave me about Jordan.
Seriously? - Yeah.
I mean, I don't buy the whole out-of-my-league thing, but you were right about him being wrong for me.
well, you're welcome.
I'll show you to... - Actually, no.
uh, so, after I told off Jordan, which was incredibly fun, by the way, I got to wondering.
what's wrong with us?
why do the Mercer sisters keep picking the wrong guys?
is this you giving me love advice?
I'm just asking.
why are you wasting your time tutoring Ethan, the guy who broke your heart, when you have someone like Thayer?
Oh, yeah, Thayer.
of course, he's just so sweet and kind and loyal as a puppy dog.
you say that like it's a bad thing.
he cares about you.
and for a while there, I thought you cared about him, too.
damn it!
what happened to the power?
Alec? Are you there?
Alec, where are you?
Alec? Is this a joke?
that was quite a spill you took.
get away.
you did that on purpose.
what? - I know what you're doing.
this whole honeymoon, the little looks, the cryptic comments.
you're, you're screwing with my head!
I know those lights didn't go off by themselves.
Yes, they did. That's exactly what happened, honey.
I went outside to check the breakers, and the box was locked.
I had to come back in and get the key. I changed it.
you're lying.
why don't you just cut this whole loving husband act and tell me why you brought me up here?
do you really think I framed you?
sweetheart, we've been through this.
if I still thought that, then where are the divorce papers?
what are we doing up here on our honeymoon?
why would I move into your house and ask my daughter to do the exact same thing?
how could I possibly make love to you?
sweetheart, if I thought you betrayed me and yet did all those things, what kind of man would that make me?
come here.
why do I get the feeling you're not just running late?
I'm sorry. I would have called earlier, but something really important came up.
sound like you're on the road.
I'm on a bus... to L. A.
of course you are.
I care about him, Ethan.
and we both know you're better off being tutored by somebody else anyway.
you're right.
tell Thayer hey.
I'm... really sorry.
so am I.
thought Sutton was coming over to help you study.
it's a change of plans.
you pissed her off, didn't you?
Yes, I did. Anything else?
Ethan, the way I see it, you can either sit here and feel sorry for yourself, or you can go find Sutton and beg for forgiveness.
because I'm telling you, her help is the only thing that is standing between you and a trip back to juvie right now.
it's a good speech, Dan.
just a little too late.
look, nobody wants these two back together more than I do, but, I mean, one day, they're fighting in public, and the next day we're in counseling trying to work things out.
meanwhile, everyone's miserable.
honey, it's a process.
your mother and I are both working very hard to try...
when does it end?
I'm sorry, I know this is going to sound terrible, but sometimes I look around me and see how this is affecting everybody, and I just think maybe the two of you are better off...
what are you saying, Sutton?
you want Mom and Dad to get a divorce just because it's too hard for you to watch them work things out?
I'm saying that they need to make a decision and stick with it.
do you have any idea how selfish you sound right now?
Oh, really, Laurel? And what if Mom actually wants a divorce?
okay, I think maybe everyone needs to take a little time-out.
who asked you? - Laurel!
that's okay. - Actually,
I think... I think I understand what Sutton is saying.
and in her own way, she's, she's just trying to look out for me.
why do you think that?
well, Sutton's always been strong-willed, and while it hasn't made it easy being her mom, I've always just admired that strength.
you know, when she was a baby, the night Sutton came home to live with us was the happiest of my life, but I was terrified.
I mean, the adoption... it happened so quickly. I felt so unprepared.
what if I did something wrong?
what if you cried, and I couldn't comfort you?
I stayed with you in the nursery all night just holding you.
and you know what?
you didn't cry at all.
you were so calm, just looking around, taking everything in.
I know this sounds crazy, but it was almost... it's almost like you were being strong for me.
it's great that you intercepted that drawing of me, but it is just a reminder that we are running out of time.
I think it's time we step things up.
well, what does that mean exactly?
because we're doing everything that we can.
well, are we?
I mean, I hate to say it, Sutton, but it sounds like family therapy was kind of a bust.
okay, look, I know it didn't go as well as I had planned, but I'm working on this speech for the banquet, and trust me... I am covering everything: the lies, the infidelity, the fights between Ted and Kristin.
well, that's good, but I think we need to take things a little bit further.
well, how much further?
I mean, when you take that stage with Kristin sitting in the front row, that's when you tell everybody the truth that Dr. Ted Mercer is your biological father.
you're kidding. - Not at all.
but are you sure?
I mean, look, I know that that's huge,
but don't you think it's a little much?
Plus, people will know that you're my mother if I say that.
I know...
and no one will be more shocked than I.
after all, who knew that you were the daughter I was forced to give up 17 years ago?
well, what about Alec?
what's he gonna say when all of this comes out?
don't worry about that.
you just work on the speech, and when the time comes, I'll take care of Alec Rybak.
what's with the suitcase?
I mean, I know we've been kind of been avoiding each other, but you're moving out?
you're right, I have been avoiding you, but that's not why I'm leaving.
my dad is staying at Rebecca's now and wants me to move in with him tomorrow.
Rebecca's... where Jordan lives.
unfortunately.
you know, if you liked him, you could have just told me.
well, the thing is, I don't.
and now I'm just really sorry that this whole stupid incident came between us.
Yeah, me, too.
we're friends?
Yeah, friends.
well, then, as your friend... and I know you say you're not interested... but I'm totally over Jordan, so if you're thinking of kissing him again, go for it.
thank you, but there are a million reasons why that's never gonna happen, including the fact that we are practically related.
and you're sure about that? - Positive.
Hi! Thayer, thank God.
why didn't you call me back?
did you get my message about the desk clerk telling me that there were two women at the motel?
okay, slow down. - What? I thought you'd be happy to see me.
you asked me to come here, and here I am.
Yeah, I am, but I asked you to come with me... two days ago.
I didn't realize there was an expiration date.
Oh, hey! Who's this?
no one.
Emma, could you stop for a second?
that girl you saw is just... - What? Payback?
look, maybe I should have said yes and come with you out here.
but you need to get past the stupid idea that I have feelings for Ethan!
okay, listen, I really don't want to talk about this right now, okay?
right now or ever?
listen, stop.
can I at least give you a ride to the bus station?
don't bother.
you don't want to keep your blonde waiting.
Hi. - Big day, huh?
it could end up being a lot bigger than people realize.
what are you talking about? - Nothing.
just nervous for my speech.
still I'm not quite sure what I'm going to say.
Yeah, well, before she left, Emma seemed kind of worried about that, too.
big surprise.
she always expects the worst of me.
well, maybe this is your chance to prove her wrong.
Oh, hey, sweetheart.
Oh, you look beautiful.
thank you. You, too.
you feeling nervous about your speech?
little more than I thought I would.
it's gonna be fine.
Hey, Mom, that story you told yesterday at therapy about my first night at home?
how come you never told me that before?
well, honey, I'm... I'm sure I did.
maybe it's just the first time you listened.
Oh, my.
hey there.
moving in already?
no, not until tomorrow. I'm just dropping off a few things.
why don't you drop your bags and hang out for a minute?
no, thank you. - Well, why don't you let me help you?
unpack later.
what the hell was that?
stop smiling. 'Cause whatever you think is about to happen really isn't.
Oh, is that right? - Yeah.
what's really going on here, Mads?
and don't say dropping the sweaters off and stuff, 'cause you could do that tomorrow.
I promised myself I wouldn't.
well, then, I guess you lied.
the biggest gift my father has given me is the example he's set by donating his time and talents to others in need.
that's why we're here today, and it's why I'm proud to call him my dad.
so...
I had written a speech about my dad... bunch of cliches about how great of a doctor he is, how great of a humanitarian, and don't get me wrong, that's very true.
but today I want to talk about another truth.
something you don't know about Ted Mercer.
and that... and that... is... that his greatest accomplishment and the smartest thing he has ever done was to marry my mom Kristin Mercer.
because she is the one who makes this family work.
and together, she and my dad have built a life that any child would be so lucky to be a part of.
even an ungrateful daughter who hasn't always paid attention enough to notice.
honey, that was...
ladies and gentlemen, Phoenix Surgical Humanitarian of the Year, Dr. Ted Mercer.
Hey, Sutton. - Ethan, not right now, please.
W... what? That was great.
no, it wasn't.
you don't understand. It wasn't great.
are you kidding me? You were real up there.
okay, so many times you've talked about how you've changed, but that was from the heart. All right, that was the... that was the Sutton Mercer from the ranch that night.
well, wonderful.
I gave a sappy speech about my parents in front of a bunch of doctors.
what is that going to get me?
this.
home sweet home.
so quiet.
I think I hear him out by the pool.
all right, well, will you say hi for me?
I'm gonna go upstairs and take a bath. - Sure.
Bye, baby.
Alec. Hey.
how was the, uh, how was the honeymoon?
it was memorable.
good.
you're doing laps at this hour, huh?
Yeah.
you haven't seen Mads, have you?
she was going to stop by here and drop some stuff off.
no, I haven't seen her.
she might have been here earlier while I was gone, though. Don't know.
good night.
I thought you said you weren't going to do that anymore.
well, I thought so, too.
and now we're living under the same roof.
so, things went pretty bad with Thayer, huh?
Yeah.
should have known it wouldn't work out, though, when he didn't return any of my phone calls.
Oh, well, when are you coming back?
soon.
the last bus out last night was canceled, so I had to sleep here at the station, and it was just...
shower's free if you want it.
who are you talking to?
Oh, great.
Hey, I didn't realize you'd left already, but I just wanted to say good luck at regionals and reiterate how completely genius that speech was last night.
thank you.
love you.
anyways, I guess I will just check in on you later, okay?
wait, Mads, no, don't, tell me what...
Sutton, I thought you were on your...
running late, so do you mind moving? I can get a yogurt.
thank you.
saguaro Bus Lines 237 to Riverside, San Bernardino, and Phoenix, now boarding.
thank you.
you missed this.
what are you doing here?
Oh, I checked the bus schedule, figured I still might be able to catch you.
listen, Emma, that girl you saw at my apartment is just a friend.
we surf together, but that's it.
well, why didn't you just tell me that?
because I can be hardheaded sometimes.
but I also don't want to be one of those guys that lets pride get in the way of what he really wants.
and what do you really want?
one question:
those messages you left about Sutton and the second woman at the motel...
did you come here because you want my help or because you want me?
both.
Thayer, when you left, I... I...
tennis Regionals Today
are you crazy? What are you doing?
what the hell happened at the banquet?
I don't know, I...
you had a golden opportunity and you folded.
are you going soft on me?
no...
look, I just realized that my feelings for Kristin are a little bit more complicated than I had thought.
and I know she's not my mother, but I...
but maybe you prefer her to be.
no.
I was just up on that stage, and... and to humiliate her in front of everybody...
I'm just not as okay with it as you are.
well, I'm very sorry to hear that, sweetheart, because now you've forced me to do something I was hoping I could avoid.
what is this?
it's a journal, handwritten by Kristin Mercer.
read it and you'll see, when you were a baby, that this "wonderful mother" that you spoke so glowingly about wanted to give you away.
Emma: A few months ago, I discovered I had a twin sister.
and then she asked me to take her place,
put yourself in my shoes.
how long could you keep up the lying game?
if Ted is really my father,
Derek's mother brought them by my office.
we have to stake out that cemetery.
this whole thing would be a lot easier for me if you just tell me what Alec told you when he was in jail.
you still think Alec killed Derek? - Who else would want to protect the secret of the twins so badly they'd kill for it?
you shouldn't tell Ethan anything.
keep this between us.
Oh, is that a touchy subject?
I think you know you made a mistake choosing Thayer.
son, if you're in trouble with Rebecca,
I can help you out.
our marriage is over.
did you kiss my wife?
Yes, I did. Bastard!
Theresa, it's Sutton Mercer.
you?
any luck? Another voice mail.
I've already left ten messages.
where could she be?
Mr. Whitehorse, we were supposed to get started an hour ago.
I know. I know.
just a few more minutes.
she's coming, she'll be here.
well, are you sure?
Theresa doesn't have cold feet.
if she's not here, there's a good reason for it.
okay.
Yeah. I mean, she's coming.
I'm sure she's on her way.
of course, she is. Yup.
Sutton: So much for "Here Comes the Bride."
what are you doing here?
same thing you are.
looking for Theresa.
she always this late to things, or just weddings?
why are you looking for Theresa?
because I want to talk to her about Derek's murder.
I have some thoughts.
it's weird that she isn't here, isn't it?
I know Emma convinced you not to trust me.
but you broke up with me for the wrong reasons.
we don't have time to do this right now, all right?
given the shocking lack of a bride, don't you think it's already ruined?
go.
there's still no sign of her.
I'm sure she's okay.
there's got to be a good explanation for this.
Yeah, I don't, I don't know, you know?
maybe, maybe there is.
well, what are you thinking?
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm thinking.
Luke: Look, this fight with Ethan,
I hate how this is coming between us, Emma.
things are falling apart around here.
is this about your dad?
I know that.
and that's why I want to clear his name.
Kristin served him with divorce papers last night.
I'm, I'm sorry.
I, I should have been there for you.
I try... I tried calling.
I didn't feel like talking.
I'm here for you now.
I just, I need to talk to Ted.
I know he'll have an explanation,
Yeah.
okay? Uh, Dan wanted to thank you all for coming.
uh, you know, I'm sure everything will be okay.
and we'll be back here soon.
thank you.
Dan! Dan, hey!
I'm coming with you. - Get in.
poor guy.
I thought you said they were really into each other.
well, maybe she was hiding something.
or he was.
just don't know with some people.
great.
here we go again.
Where'd you go last night, anyway?
needed some time to think.
be alone.
and the truth is, it really scares me.
I would never do anything to hurt you, Mads.
well, I don't know what to believe anymore.
how am I supposed to trust you, Jordan?
all right, what if I tell you that I was done with Rebecca?
forever.
I would say you have to prove it.
jordan, are you okay?
Oh, I'm perfect. Thanks for asking.
you ready?
Yeah, I'm all set.
did, uh, did you talk to Dan?
no.
he left too quick.
I'll catch up with him later.
it's so strange.
I can't believe that Theresa would leave him at the altar.
I really hate it when you stare at me like that.
I'm just curious.
yet when I get home, you're not there.
I told you, I went to the pharmacy, and when I got home, the bed was empty, and you still haven't told me where you were.
that's right.
I haven't.
I know how hard this has been on you and Sutton.
I never wanted any of this to happen.
then explain it.
the affair, the missing money. It...
all you've done is lie. I know.
I know.
we're not trying to attack you.
we just want to understand what happened.
I don't know where to begin.
all that matters is, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
maybe you should go now.
sorry, girls, but your dad should not be here right now.
I am seeing my daughters.
if you could give us a minute, please. - No, I can't.
Kristin, please! - Do I have to call the lawyer?
this is our agreement that we have - between the two of us. - I'm seeing my daughters!
dad, Laurel and I will come to the club for dinner.
it will give us a chance to talk about everything, and... are you free tonight?
mom, is that okay with you?
it's fine. - Good.
then it's settled. We'll see you tonight, Dad.
good-bye, girls.
just know, whatever happens, I love you.
Theresa, you in there, you okay?!
get out of the way.
I'll check the bedroom.
all her clothes are gone.
what's that?
I found it on the counter.
no. No.
she would never leave me like this.
the ring, Dan.
and her clothes are gone.
No!
no.
she, she got too close.
she knew something,
Ethan, he could have, he could have gotten her keys.
you know, to make me think...
what, what are you, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about Derek's killer.
now, whoever he or she is,
Theresa was hot on the trail of that and there was, you know, the flowers.
somebody was leaving flowers on Derek's grave?
Dan, wait!
Sutton. I know you're in there. Come on.
what?
I have been worried about you.
I haven't heard from you since my...
little confession. - Little?
you are my mother.
I am supposed to be able to trust you.
well, sometimes parents have to lie to their children to protect them.
can you find it in your heart to forgive me?
I don't know.
do I know everything now?
Absolutely.
what about Theresa?
word is that she didn't show up for her own wedding.
Yes.
troubling, isn't it?
she's Alec's attorney.
she knows a lot about the case.
I was thinking the same thing.
you don't think Alec did anything to her, do you?
or... maybe that uber-villain that you were telling me about did something.
maybe he is going to frame Alec.
or you will.
what's this about, Sutton?
I'm just...
speculating.
hmm.
well, I have something for you.
something special.
actually the reason I came.
one half for you.
and the other half I'm saving for Emma.
it symbolizes our broken family coming back together again.
you and your sister and...
your father kissed me last night.
you were with Ted last night?
briefly.
Kristin served him divorce papers.
he wanted to see me.
I really think he's starting to trust me again.
almost sounds too good to be true.
Emma: Theresa's missing? Since when?
MADS: Well, apparently since last night after the rehearsal dinner.
and no one knows why she didn't show up to the wedding today.
what?
you know something?
she was just still looking into Derek's murder... Ethan told me.
Oh, my God, you don't think that...
someone might have targeted her, because of what she knew?
Rebecca, if she killed Derek.
wait, you think Rebecca killed Derek?
it's possible. - Why didn't you tell me?
okay, wait a second, you still suspect Rebecca?
because after the formal, I thought you might have changed your minds.
no, we... we just needed time - to think things through. - THAYER: Speaking of, Mads, do you know where our dad was last night?
Yeah, he came home with me after the rehearsal dinner.
and then... - Then what?
he went out again.
but that doesn't mean anything.
every time something bad happens, you can't blame it on him, Thayer.
I mean, my God, for all we know
Theresa just freaked out about getting married and took off.
it happens. - But if she didn't just run away...
I got to go.
Hey, hey.
just slow down.
Ted wouldn't hurt Theresa or Derek.
only a psychopath would do that.
and that isn't Ted.
Shh. But you're worried how it looks.
Yes. Thayer, think about the timing.
Theresa finds out about the blackmail money and then...
disappears a few days later?
that doesn't look good for Ted.
which is why we have to keep this quiet now more than ever.
I just need to find out where he was last night so I can prove that he didn't hurt Theresa.
are you just gonna ask him?
no. I have an idea, but I need your help.
okay. - Come with me.
Hi. - Hey.
you look beautiful.
thank you for the flowers. They...
they were so sweet.
what are you drinking? - I'll have a...
cranberry vodka. - BARTENDER: Got it.
thank you.
listen, Alec, I...
I served Ted with papers.
it's over.
I wish I could say I'm sorry.
but I'm not.
I mean, you're still married.
technically, I'm not even divorced yet, so...
Aw, listen, I got married for all the wrong... all the wrong reasons, and as soon as I can, I'm going to correct that.
I was thinking about my daughters. - 'Course you are.
do you want me to walk away from this, is that what you're saying?
no, I don't want that either. I just...
it's complicated.
well, let's...
make it uncomplicated.
what are you doing this evening?
well, Ted has the girls, and I don't have plans.
so have dinner with me.
like a date?
we'll be discreet.
I'm not taking no for an answer.
this is like when we were in high school and you made me climb that water tower.
you dared me to climb that water tower.
you loved it. - It was...
terrified... it was pitch black.
are you sorry you did it?
no.
okay.
I'm in.
one second.
Alec Rybak.
I need you to tape off the area around this grave.
get the techs out here. This is a crime scene.
you said this had something to do with Theresa.
Yeah, it does, I think she came here last night before she went missing.
there's women's footprints everywhere, along with another set... a man.
so we need to get him identified right now.
Dan, it's a cemetery. A lot of people come through...
I... I don't care what it is!
Theresa's life could be on the line. Hey, come on!
did anyone call the detectives yet?
where the hell are they?
give me this.
you want to explain this to me?
Ethan: I think Dan just did.
I'm starting to agree with him.
thank you, officers.
it's all right. There seems to have been a bit of a misunderstanding here.
you guys head back.
my office has this.
officer Whitehorse, can I talk to you for a sec?
what the hell's going on, Dan?
something happened to Theresa, and you know it.
she was all over this case.
what do you think, - the killer came after her? - Yes, I do.
and now you're gonna help me find her. No, come on, man.
you're too close to this, okay?
you're gonna get yourself hurt.
what you should do is go home, take some time off and leave it to me.
the hell I will. This whole thing is your fault.
she got too close to something because of whatever you said to her when she was your lawyer!
I wish I could walk that back...
Dan: Now you're gonna tell me what it is.
you're gonna tell me! - If I had the time...
Ethan: Come on, come on, Dan!
swear to God! - Dan, let it go, man.
what did you say, Alec?!
Danny, that's not the way to go about this, man, okay?
you think I'm gonna drop this?
I suppose not.
you're damn right.
thanks for checking the records for us J. J.
I promise, your meals are on me for the next week.
look, just let's keep it between us, all right?
our members' comings and goings are supposed to be private.
I know, don't worry about it.
I just need to know if my dad was here last night. Nope.
picked up his car from the valet at 10: 08 p. m.
what time did he come back?
uh, 4: 21 a. m.
must have had one hell of a night.
Hey, J. J. Hey.
guys, I need to talk to you.
THAYER: Thanks, man.
I appreciate it.
what was that about? - I was, uh, seeing about applying for a part-time valet job.
I just wanted some extra cash on the side.
are you applying, too?
no, I'm with him.
of course.
we're really sorry about Theresa.
we heard.
actually, I think something happened to her...
and it's somehow tied to Derek's murder.
THAYER: Okay.
let's talk upstairs.
Hey.
I really didn't like your attitude this morning.
what was I thinking?
this is about Mads, isn't it?
hmm? I saw the two of you talking at church.
what have I told you about getting involved with her?
well, I don't take orders from you anymore.
Really? - Yeah, really.
look, I care about her, all right?
so she deserves to know the truth.
so I'm gonna tell her about L. A.
and how you will never let me forget it. - I see.
are you gonna tell her about Flagstaff?
and that call you made to frame Alec?
that was your idea.
Yeah, and you screwed it up.
and now he's out free.
do you really think Mads is gonna understand when she learns that you framed her own father?
you tell her.
I just think if you want to tell her the truth, she should probably know everything.
don't you?
Ethan: And Dan thinks Theresa went to the cemetery last night to find the person leaving the flowers.
a killer with a guilty conscience.
what?
nothing, it's... nothing.
all right, screw it.
we need to come clean with Dan right now, just... we need to tell him everything.
we can't do that. - Emma, come on.
if Dan knows what's going on, all of your suspicions about Rebecca and the twin secret, it might help him find Theresa.
you can't tell him anything... if Dan knows about the twins, he might be in danger, too.
he's a cop! He can handle it.
we just need a little time. - For what?
all right, enough of this crap.
you guys tell me what's going on.
Ethan, you just have to trust me.
you're not trusting me. - Okay, okay, we've said all we're gonna say.
you should go now.
Yeah.
whatever.
you think he'll keep quiet?
I hope so.
Hey. You okay?
I just got reprimanded.
for what happened with Alec?
what was that about anyway, man?
told Theresa a secret when she was - his lawyer. - A secret?
said it was a family matter.
and, you know, I... I feel like if I knew what that was, all of this would make a hell of a lot more sense.
so what are you gonna do?
supposed to stay out of it.
captain's orders.
Yeah, but you're not going to.
no. I'm not.
starting right now.
what?
what do you know?
why would I know something?
don't play dumb with me right now.
you and your friends were helping out with the case when I arrested Alec.
are you protecting Sutton?
does she have something to do with this?
no.
I swear, I have told you everything.
I really hope so.
I really do.
okay, this is just not good timing.
I want to call a truce, Emma.
Really?
and why should I believe you?
because I want answers just as badly as you do.
so I'm gonna be honest.
you're right.
Rebecca and I have been working together ever since the night I went into the lake.
I knew it.
so she knows we're twins?
I'm pretty sure she's known since the delivery room.
why would she tell you and not me?
she says she wanted to tell you eventually but wanted to wait...
it's all part of her master plan to get Ted back.
she says she still loves him.
Oh, my God. And you just went along with it behind my back?
I did.
Yeah.
and I know it was selfish, but...
I've been looking so long for her, and then things got bad between you and me. I just... I didn't...
I didn't want to share her.
so, why the sudden change of heart?
because I started to realize she's not the mother I thought she was.
she's lying to me, too, Emma.
you just... you have to believe me.
I never meant to hurt anybody.
in fact, I called Theresa last night to arrange a meeting to just tell her everything.
she just didn't show.
what time last night?
11 o'clock.
well, Rebecca...
must have found out you were gonna bust her, and... and she...
went after Theresa.
maybe, but...
Rebecca claims she didn't do it, which is why you and I need to work together.
we just... we need to share information, be a team.
no, Sutton.
no.
come on, Emma, we're sisters.
don't you think it's a little late to be playing that card?
you need to leave.
interesting.
you're not telling me what you know, which can only mean one thing.
what are you hiding, Emma?
is your offer still good?
to help with Rebecca?
I can't...
live like this anymore.
well, that depends...
on what your intentions are.
is this just about Rebecca or is this about Maddie?
well, as long as Rebecca keeps making me do all this crazy crap,
Mads will never give me another chance.
so, yeah.
Yeah, it is.
if I help you and you hurt Maddie...
I wouldn't.
trust me, she's...
all I ever think about anymore.
it's why I came to you, 'cause I don't want to lose her.
all right.
you have a deal.
I help you, you help me.
what do you want me to do?
nothing.
just what you've been doing.
whatever Rebecca asks you to do.
have you seen Mom?
uh, ran off to her salon.
right after mentioning she was going to dinner tonight.
with Alec?
survey says ding, ding, ding.
Wow. She doesn't waste any time.
well, Dad cheated on her and stole from her and lied to her.
you don't exactly seem to be on Team Dad right now, so how about I just go to dinner alone with him?
I have things I need to talk to him about anyway.
like how he's really your birth father?
I did the math.
she's your mother, they had an affair...
you must've figured this out.
Yeah.
I did.
I'm just not quite sure how I feel about it yet.
me neither.
I mean, he has to know.
right?
somehow he ends up adopting his own daughter?
that can't be a coincidence.
do you think he knows about you two?
I don't think so.
either way, he's been deceiving Mom and all of us for the last 17 years.
it doesn't get much worse than that.
I hope not.
is there something else?
it's just that I've been searching for answers about my birth parents for so long now, and I finally have them, and I'm...
kind of sorry I started asking the questions in the first place.
well...
I'm not.
you're my half-sister, Emma.
and despite it all, if you and Sutton hadn't been asking those questions...
we never would've found each other.
what do you want, Sutton?
the truth.
that's ironic.
all right, I deserve that.
listen.
I think Emma knows something about Theresa's disappearance and Derek's murder, and she won't tell me what it is.
if you think I know something, you're wrong.
I don't.
keeping you out of it, huh?
that's a switch.
I thought they only lied to me.
look. I want to help you and Dan.
I feel terrible about what happened with Theresa, and honestly I don't understand it.
all right, look.
Dan and Theresa found $20, 000 at Derek's house.
we think someone was paying him to keep quiet about you and Emma, and that's what got him killed.
you mean, you thought Rebecca killed him.
that I know.
the Flipside Formal...
Yeah, that's where it all changed.
all of a sudden,
Emma just drops her suspicions.
and every time I bring it up, she and Thayer just shut me down.
there has to be a way we can find out.
maybe there is.
I got to run.
come on, what is it? Tell me.
you look nice.
Hey.
Thanks. I'm going out to have dinner with a friend.
Yes.
I heard you might be seeing her.
so...
what about Rebecca?
we're still working things out.
I...
I think maybe you should divorce her.
I mean, who knows what she's capable of and what...
she and Jordan have going on together?
it's all starting to get me pretty worried.
honey, let me do the worrying, okay?
I can handle Rebecca. - Okay.
Hey, have you talked to Thayer lately?
cause he's still blaming you for everything.
well, you know, h... he'll come around.
it'll all be really clear to him really soon.
Ethan, what are you doing here? Come on.
it's Ted, isn't it?
that's who you were covering for.
I talked to J. J.
applying for a job, my ass.
you wanted to know where Ted was last night - when Theresa went missing. - No,
I am concerned about him and Kristin - and the divorce. - Stop lying!
you suspect him, don't you?
would you just keep it down, please?
I think he's innocent. I really do, but I also know how bad this looks for him, and that's why...
we couldn't say anything to anybody.
"we"?
you mean you and Thayer?
let me guess, this was his idea?
he's looking out for me, Ethan. - Or he's trying to drive us apart, trying to convince you that I can't be trusted.
well, then prove him wrong.
if this gets out, it will ruin my whole family.
what about my family?
what about Dan?
I know this is really unfair of me to ask of you, but please...
don't tell him.
not until we can prove that Ted is innocent.
Theresa is missing, okay?
she could be dead.
if Ted is responsible for this...
I just need time.
give me one night. Tonight.
look...
last night, when you came here, you said that you and me, we're everything.
if you believe that and if that's true, you will do this for me.
I am not the only one home.
what is it that couldn't wait?
Derek was blackmailing someone about me and Emma.
was it you?
no.
how do you know about that?
it doesn't matter.
the point is, whoever Derek was blackmailing is probably the person who killed him.
and Theresa. - Who told you that?
hmm? Ethan? Emma?
if it wasn't you, why are you freaking out?
you need to tell me.
do they know who was being blackmailed?
do you?
answer the question.
you answer it.
forget it. I can find out another way.
I don't understand. Who are you possibly protecting here? Ted?
that is your father you are talking about.
God, okay. I'm sorry.
dad, what are you doing?
I thought we were meeting at the club.
dropped my hospital key card somewhere. I...
do you guys know where it is?
did you put it somewhere? - No.
listen, about tonight,
I really wanted to talk to you about some things.
Yeah, no. Great, we'll talk.
I just need to find this damn key card.
well, did you retrace your steps?
where was the last place you used it?
yesterday at the hospital.
and after?
where were you last night?
out.
out where?
well, what is it with all these questions, Sutton?
sorry. I'm just trying to help.
that son of a bitch. - KRISTIN: Ted, how many times do I have to ask you? Please?
you're going to a hotel with Alec?
that's none of your business.
what are you doing? Are you spying on me?
you're going to screw him, aren't you? - EMMA: Oh, my God.
how dare you do this in front of our daughters! Have you lost your mind?
what's going on? - We're talking about Alec, the most untrustworthy bastard on the planet.
Oh, really? 'Cause I thought that's what you were.
Emma: Dad?
get out.
I'm sorry. - Get out now before I call the police.
REBECCA: I have a new assignment for you.
okay.
well, I've given it some thought, and...
maybe I was wrong to keep you and Mads apart.
jordan: You... wrong?
Wow. I don't know if I've ever heard you say that before.
her friends are looking into Theresa's disappearance.
I want you to get close to her again and find out what they know.
jordan: You want me to spy on Mads?
I want you to spy on all of them, and she's your way in.
then all you have to do is keep your ears open.
is that a problem?
no.
not at all.
report back to me.
what happened?
did he hurt you?
no. Did he hit you?
no, but... he was so angry.
I just... I've never seen him like that.
if he ever comes near you again, I want you to call me.
Alec, please. I don't want to get you involved.
it's... it's... it's not like I'm in danger.
it's too late. I'm already involved.
Oh, Alec.
I don't think...
I know.
you're not ready for this.
it's okay.
I'm sorry. - It's okay.
Hey.
it's okay.
it would have been a lovely evening.
it still will be...
some day.
THAYER: So he just snapped?
it doesn't necessarily mean he killed anyone.
well, maybe we should just give him a chance to cool off.
I don't have time.
Ethan's only giving me until morning.
wait. You told Ethan about Ted?
he figured it out on his own.
but I got him to stay quiet, at least until tomorrow.
you got him to stay quiet?
how'd you do that?
I... I asked him.
I still have more time.
where are you going? - To make sure I'm not wrong.
I'll come with you. - No. Thayer,
I have to do this alone.
what do you want?
I've just been wondering where I went wrong with you.
is that supposed to be funny?
is that a joke?!
you are a terrible father.
all the stuff you put me through.
you don't know why I do the things I do, T?
because you blame me, and you hate me.
because you've always hated me.
and because of Mom... and what happened?
no.
listen to me.
whatever happens...
just know that I've done everything and will continue to do everything for you...
because I love you.
okay.
Oh, my God, what happened? Are... are you okay?
it's got to be here somewhere.
Ted, calm down.
talk to me, tell me...
what's wrong?
everything's wrong.
forget it.
you wouldn't understand.
you'd be surprised.
whatever it is, I'm on your side.
you can trust me... with anything.
I'm sorry, I can't. I have to go.
you got a minute?
no, I don't.
look, Rebecca told me to spy on you.
and your dad told me to spy on Rebecca.
wait. He did? - Yeah.
and this might sound crazy, but I'm doing all of this for you, Mads.
so I can finally be free of her.
you need to be careful.
Rebecca might be more dangerous than even you realize.
I know a lot more than you think.
and not only about Rebecca.
about... Sutton.
and Emma.
Theresa? - I already searched it.
she took everything.
except, this must have fallen between the seats.
what is it?
I'll give you a minute.
it's her vows.
I promise, I will always be by your side, Dan.
you are my soul mate, my lover, my best friend.
and I can't wait to begin our life together.
does that sound like someone who got cold feet to you?
no, it doesn't.
someone's trying really hard to make everyone think that she's left me.
she wouldn't do that.
so where is she?
I don't know.
but when I find the person who took her from me...
I'm going to kill him.
looking for this?
my God!
how could you?
a few months ago I discovered I had a twin sister.
and then she asked me to take her place,
put yourself in my shoes.
how long could you keep up the lying game?
Theresa is missing.
give me one night... tonight.
you are my brother!
and you lied right to my face.
everything okay?
Dan threw him out.
you're always welcome to stay on the couch.
I just want to know where I stand.
you're going to a hotel with Alec?
that's none of your business.
what makes you think that's what I want?
I kissed you.
one-half for you, the other half I'm saving for Emma.
what does she have over you?
let's just say I have Rebecca's trust.
you would do anything to protect me, wouldn't you?
anything.
Dan, you know you can't go there.
get away from me! Get the hell away from me!
Hey, hey, come on, man!
Hey, we can take your car.
you can take your car and meet 'em there.
I just need to be with her.
there's nothing else you can do.
look at you people.
with all your secrets, your lies.
someone here did this.
I'm gonna find out who it is.
and when I do, I swear to God!
Hey, man, you're blowing it.
we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right, but we're gonna do it by the book.
Hey, let's just go.
you have my word.
let's just go.
Emma - I have to.
Emma, come on. Emma...
I'm so sorry.
I feel... that this is awful.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah, and look, the fundraiser's this weekend, but something's come up.
I don't know how appropriate it would be for me...
no, don't cancel.
just find another keynote speaker.
listen, I got to jump.
take it easy, big guy.
if it's any consolation, I know just how you feel.
you really know how I feel, Alec?
and, well, look at that.
I can't even feel this.
listen, Dan, if you need... if you need some time...
no, no. I don't... I don't need time.
I need the truth.
and I need the facts.
the fact is is Rebecca's the killer.
see, that's a theory.
what I don't know is what you told Theresa.
I'm betting whatever it was, is what got her killed.
listen...
you're gonna tell me right now what happened to her, or I swear to God - I will kill you right here in this hallway. - I know, I know,
I know you're upset. It's okay.
okay, all right, there is something we've been keeping from you.
myself...and the twins.
what are you talking about, twins?
there's another Sutton, and her name's Emma.
see ya, Thayer.
well, this changes everything.
back in my room, before the sirens,
I asked you for the truth.
I... I don't even remember.
Yeah, you do.
you were avoiding it then, and you're avoiding it now.
you cannot get Ethan out of your head.
I felt it since we slept together.
right away, you started to pull back.
and now, tonight, at the pool, it's all about Ethan again.
Yeah, just, I'm really confused.
I have... it's just thoughts.
I don't believe you.
I think you already have.
Thayer, that's not fair.
no, no, not fair is you keeping this from me.
being with me,
well, you need to, Emma.
it's a clear-cut choice. It's him or it's me.
when you figure it out, let me know.
I'm sorry.
didn't tell you about Ted.
and I know every second I didn't say anything could've made a difference.
I kept it from you a whole night.
a lot longer than that, little brother.
a lot longer than that.
I'd say you been lying to me since the two of them have, what? Switched places.
that's right.
I know all about 'em.
twins.
who told you?
who cares who told me?!
your my brother.
I'm, I'm sorry. - What?!
I don't know what else to say! I'm sorry!
let me tell you something.
you got to make a choice.
you either choose family...
or you choose those twins.
Hey.
I wasn't sure where you'd end up tonight.
how's Dan? Did you see him?
Yeah. He's bad.
I just came by to pick up my stuff.
or with you or myself.
he gave me an ultimatum.
stop right there.
but no, I'm... I'm choosing you, Ethan.
Emma, it's too late.
what do you mean, it's too late?
I've been lying to my brother for months.
I kept the secret, and now his fiance is dead.
that's got nothing to do with Thayer.
it's because of my feelings for you.
that's not true.
Ethan, you can't do this.
do what?
be honest?
Emma, I fell in love with you, and both our lives went to hell.
not because of us...
Yes, it was because of us.
we played along with the lie.
we became the lie.
I, I don't know what you're saying.
I think you do.
I think you knew this day was coming.
please don't say it.
okay.
I won't.
so, when do you stop when the balls run our or when you're not angry anymore?
I'm just think that talking... the gentle flapping of lips...
might be a little less taxing.
Hey!
sorry.
okay, I sense this is about Thayer.
or Ethan?
both.
and Theresa, what happened.
when you say "everything..."
I mean everything.
especially Kristin.
I mean, of all the lies that I have told, the worst have been to her, and she's so innocent in all of this.
it's gonna hit her the hardest, Laurel.
our mom is strong and smart.
Yeah, and she's been lied to by everyone, including her daughters.
a strong, smart woman would walk away from that.
what?
I was trying to think of something funny and witty to say, but I can't think of anything.
Yeah, 'cause you know it's possible.
I'm gonna go take a shower.
don't worry. I'll get the balls.
all one million of them.
Hey.
I didn't think you were coming back here.
sleep seems to be a complete waste of time, and I guess I just figure that you would be off with, uh, some twin or another.
I am done with all of that.
I'm choosing family.
okay.
then I need to know everything about Rebecca Sewell Rybak and who's been working with her.
you know that she's the mother of the twins?
and you know how Sutton and Rebecca connected.
Yes, and they've been working together in secret, the whole Ted connection. I've got all that.
jordan was apparently doing stuff for her, but it was in the past.
he's definitely on our side now.
all right.
it doesn't matter how suspicious Rebecca looks.
if we don't have any proof, she will walk.
yeah? - This just came in.
preliminary autopsy report.
the cause of death blunt-force trauma injuries, injury to the head area.
probable weapon used rusted metal object, fragments of green paint detected.
no water found in the lungs.
time of death approximately 48 to 72 hours ago.
limestone?
limestone?
underneath her nails and remnants on her clothing.
let's go.
I started all this.
if would have just told you I found Emma - from the beginning - Or if I would've told Kristin you were mine when I brought you home.
look, honey, you can try and rewrite history all you want.
it doesn't change anything.
but if Rebecca is involved...
I don't care if Rebecca did or didn't do it.
I'll let Dan and the police figure that out, honey.
I have got to tell Kristin. I can still save this family.
but she'll find out that I've been working with Rebecca all this time.
and what about Emma?
everyone who's on to this has accepted Emma, and they see her as you, and...
I know.
she's the more improved version.
I get that a lot.
please, just...
look at it from Mom's point of view.
how many more lies can she take?
if we dump this on her right now, it will blow up in our faces.
and then if that happens, she may never forgive us and then we're all rejected.
we can't take that chance.
we just need more time, Dad, for me and for Emma.
promise me, Dad.
please.
Hello, Emma.
I'm really not going to have this conversation.
okay, then I'll talk and you listen.
I know you know the truth and that I've been working with Sutton.
and I think you know my motive also to reunite our family,
Ted and Sutton...
and you.
I told you.
I don't care.
but you need to know how much I love you, how I've always loved you.
and I never, never wanted you separated from Sutton.
I wanted you together in-in a nice home with a nice family, and if I had known that Alec was gonna split you up,
I would've stopped it.
you have to believe me.
you know what? I want to believe you.
so much.
but you came to town, and you destroyed a family.
you did nothing but tear us apart.
I didn't handle it right.
Yeah, you sure as hell didn't.
you know what, no. I have to ask you something, and I've been wanting to ask it ever since I found out you were my mother.
okay.
did you even look at us before you let Alec take us away?
Yes, I did.
and I held you, one in each arm.
you looked up at me, both of you, with your big, beautiful eyes and...
you were so quiet and so full of love.
and then I kissed you, each of you, and, um...
and you gave us away.
Yeah.
I gave you away.
Emma, I wasn't capable enough to care for you.
Oh, but you care now?
I have cared for you every single day since I gave you up.
this has been a terrible struggle for me.
a struggle?
Yes.
you want to know a struggle, Mom?
try foster care.
try six different homes, a dozen schools.
you know, I didn't even know what a hug felt like until I got here.
I'm so sorry.
no. Baby, - I'm so sorry!
I am, too.
so, we're 3. 1 miles from the cemetery.
tire tracks, footprints all around, obviously.
heel prints, high heel prints over here, over here.
there's evidence that, uh,
Theresa's hands were...were bound.
struck from behind?
potential murder weapons everywhere.
whatever it was, she most likely took it with her.
she?
I got it from here, Danny. Nice work.
are you okay, man? - No.
no.
she died... she died right here.
she died right here.
can't take it.
I didn't know if I should have hugged her or slapped her.
you didn't believe her, did you?
I don't know.
Emma, are you insane?
you cannot go soft like this.
she's our mother.
I... I want to believe that at some point, she loved us.
well, of course she did.
I've felt the same things you're feeling, and that's when I fell under her spell, and now it's happening to you.
just, it's hard.
believe me, I know.
I mean, to think that our mother is a killer...
we just need to both be strong right now.
together.
I'm realizing something.
do I have anything to do with it?
everything.
when I was bouncing around from home to home, all I ever did was run away, and just being you and living your life, it's taught me to stand up for myself.
and stay?
and stay.
has established a perimeter.
we're awaiting confirmation, but sources tell us this is where noted defense attorney Theresa...
I don't know. It's too small to see.
well, can't Thayer like, blow it up on his computer?
you'd lose too much resolution.
okay, we need somebody to tell us what's in that bag so I can tell them if it somehow points to Rebecca.
who's gonna tell us that?
the police? We're kids.
the don't really care about us.
I'm not talking about the police. I'm talking about him.
I don't want to push my way into anything.
maybe we can just go together.
I can't.
Ethan doesn't want anything to do with me, and for a good reason.
you should just go to him.
are you sure?
Yeah, I'll stay here.
be careful.
okay.
wish me luck.
so that's it then?
you're just gonna hand Ethan over on a silver platter?
Laurel, stop. Ethan and I are done.
for good, forever.
we are not getting back together. It is done.
it's okay. - No, it's not okay.
what about Thayer? Have you talked to him?
he's totally MIA, and I haven't called because I have no idea what to say to him.
I...I'm not sure how he's gonna take it.
accordingly, Mrs. Mercer expects to keep physical custody of both daughters as well as the house, the cabin at the lake, 50% of all material - assets. - Fine. Whatever you want.
you know what I want?
to know what happened to that $20, 000.
I don't even care anymore.
I just don't want to spend the rest of my life wondering.
can you give us a minute, please?
the truth is, Kristin, I love you.
I've loved you since the day I met you in ninth grade, with your cheerleader skirt, your horn-rimmed glasses.
Ted - And I have never stopped loving you.
no matter what my mistakes, there hasn't been one day when I haven't loved you.
and I know for the rest of my life, there won't be!
and there's nothing that I want to do more right now than to come clean about everything, not just the money.
what else is there?
I can't. - Please?
I can't! Right now I can't. I made a promise, and I owe it to our daughters to keep it.
our daughters? - Yes!
Kristin, please. - You know what? Just forget it.
this is just too much.
I don't know which one you are or what the hell you're doing here, but you got five minutes, and then I want you off my property.
sorry.
look, Emma and I...
stop, stop. I'm not gonna talk about Emma right now.
no, you're right. This isn't about her.
all the lies started with me.
and if I could take all of them back, I would.
I lost so much along the way, including you.
Sutton, I... I can't do this, okay?
you don't have to do anything. It's me. I want to help.
I saw the news and the crime scene.
what did they find?
come on, please.
I spent all that time with Rebecca.
I can at least tell you whether or not something...
let me try and make this up to you.
what was in that plastic bag?
it was a... a necklace.
it's like a little broken heart.
what?
did it look like this?
it's a match.
Rebecca had two of them. She gave one to Sutton.
she must have lost the other at the quarry. Now I want my warrant.
you got it, Dan. Go get her.
pack a bag... fast.
upstairs...
Harry, all clear down here.
the house is clear.
I know. She's gone.
damn it!
come on Sutton, think! You spent all that time with Rebecca. You must know where she is!
okay, stop. We should just let her go.
what? Why?
after all this?
because if she gets caught, she's gonna be the one to tell.
is that really how you want our mother to hear the truth about who you are?
it's Rebecca.
look at you two. You're so beautiful.
God, this is so far from how I imagined we'd...
where are you?
I can't...
Sutton, we were so close to having everything that we dreamed of...
until it went so wrong.
Yeah, 'cause you killed two people.
no, I didn't. I'm being framed!
by who? - I don't know!
but I had nothing to do with Derek or Theresa's murder!
you have to believe me!
but that necklace...
it was meant for you.
I had it in a locked in, in a drawer in my bedroom.
I was saving it for you.
why would I...?
look, just... where are you?
I do not want you in danger.
I don't know who's behind this or why they're trying to pin it on me, but...
please, girls.
I can't believe I'm leaving you again.
I've spent so long trying to find you and get you back.
you have to believe me that...
I love you so much. So much!
I go.
thank God you're here. I wasn't sure you'd come.
Yeah, me neither.
I just want to tell you that I'm so sorry about all this.
you know, we'll just have to start over and start new lives.
together?
well, of course.
I mean, leaving Ted and my girls, it's devastating enough.
I can't imagine doing this on my own.
what's in this for me?
why the hell would I go with you?
well, because if you don't, then I'll just make a call and make sure that you're sent away for what you've done.
I've got Mads and Alec on my side.
I'll take my chances with the accessory charge.
I'm not talking about what you've done for me.
I'm talking about what you did to your brother in Los Angeles.
you ready?
Yeah. Let's go.
I told Theresa that I didn't want to wear a suit to our wedding.
and here I am sporting one to her memorial.
I think this is, this is good, what Alec's doing.
making this charity thing a tribute for Theresa, naming that clinic after her.
see, Alec doesn't, he doesn't do good things for no reason.
I'm sure he feels responsible.
we all do.
well, I'm not going for Alec.
I'm going for Theresa.
Sutton, you look beautiful.
Thanks.
it's a sad occasion.
Yeah. I just want to be there for Dan and Ethan.
what about you?
are you going for Alec?
are you guys... together?
no, no, we're not.
I don't know what we are, actually.
I mean, I could lie, say I'm done with him, that what happened was a crazy mistake, but I'm trying to set an example for you and Laurel;
total honesty.
of course.
so if there's ever anything you want to tell me...
there is, actually. I... I honestly, there is something I want... to tell you.
I just... I love you...
mom.
honey, I love you, too.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
there's something I need to do. I'll meet you there.
dad, what are you doing here?
I came to tell Sutton that I can't keep my promise any longer.
that I have to tell Kristin everything.
and I told him that he can't. Not yet.
Sutton, I know that you are scared, but we have to have learned by now, these lies are getting us nowhere
he's right.
I can't keep doing this either.
you know I love Kristin as if she were my own.
and even if she hates me for everything that I've done, every minute that I am lying to her, I...
it just feels like it's breaking my heart.
so here's what we're gonna do:
we're gonna go to this thing together tonight,
then, afterwards, I will get Kristin alone and I will introduce you... as Emma.
no, that's, that's not... that's not my place.
can you just give us a second, please?
okay. Okay.
okay, look, I'm gonna go into hiding until you tell me to come forward.
whenever...
if ever Kristin wants to meet me, you'll just, you'll let me know.
please, Emma, things with Kristin and me have gotten got so ugly, she might throw me out.
she might...
she might want you instead.
Sutton, come on.
this is your family.
it always was.
he was always your boyfriend.
I wish that were true.
well, either way, this isn't just about a boy anymore.
you're gonna need this dress.
let me get this for you.
Yuck.
right?
excuse me. - Yeah.
what happened?
Where's Emma?
we switched back.
for the last time.
sorry. This is?
great.
listen, I just want to thank you for stepping up and helping us crack the case against Rebecca, even though it meant turning against your own mother.
of course.
I... but Kristin's my mother.
okay.
but whether or not we find Rebecca,
I'll always remember what you did.
Where's Jordan?
gone. - Gone how?
I haven't seen him since last night, and I think he may have taken off with Rebecca.
look, honey, I know our life has been a little crazy ever since Rebecca entered the picture, but, uh... now that she's gone,
I think things are gonna get...much simpler.
so you're happy she just took off?
well, no.
I mean, as a DA I wish she had stuck around.
I would've liked to have prosecuted her.
convicted her.
punished her for what she did to us.
but as a dad, yes.
I'm glad she's gone.
I want my family back.
I want Thayer back.
so you haven't given up on him?
honey, I love Thayer.
no matter what's happened, he's always gonna be my boy.
you all right?
I've been better.
I should've called or come sooner.
I just - It's fine.
kind of got my answer.
I'm so sorry.
I know I've been really unfair to you, and I owe you an explanation.
okay.
why don't you shut that door?
Alec, thank you.
thank you for honoring Theresa tonight.
I really appreciate that.
I want to thank Theresa for loving me, and for agreeing to marry me, and showing me what it means to live a life of purpose.
her passion is, ultimately, what got her killed, but it's also the legacy that she has left behind.
and - Excuse me, sir, sorry.
a lady asked me to give this to you.
this clinic will allow her work to go on forever.
and for that, I thank you all.
Hello, Alec.
thanks for the call.
but I decided
I couldn't run away after all.
you here to turn yourself in?
quite the opposite.
I figured it out.
all this time, I thought it was Ted.
and it was him I was trying to protect.
but now...
I know who the real killer is.
and I know you do, too.
where have you been?
I thought... we all thought...
that I ran off with Rebecca? - But you didn't. You're here.
she wanted me to.
she threatened that if I didn't, she would turn me in for everything she has on me.
so what are you gonna do? Run away?
I'm gonna face up to it.
I'm gonna turn myself in.
but not till tomorrow.
tonight, I thought maybe you and I could ride up to Howl Peak?
hmm? Just the two of us?
I know it sounds crazy and stupid.
sometimes crazy and stupid is good.
Yeah.
my car's the other way.
we can get you out of here. I can hide you.
no. No more hiding.
but what are they gonna do to you?
ship me back to L. A? I don't know.
it doesn't matter. It's over. - No! Jordan, no.
please.
forget you ever saw me.
forget you ever knew me.
don't, please. He didn't do anything.
currently of Scottsdale?
Yes, sir. That's me. - Turn around, please.
just go back to the party, Mads.
jordan Lyle, you're under arrest for murder.
murder?
he had nothing to do with Theresa.
he didn't murder Derek...
look, he's not talking about them!
Mads, he's talking about my brother.
about what Dan said to you earlier...
let me guess, you don't agree with him.
he meant it when he thanked you.
it's been a crazy ride.
I put you through a lot.
we put each other through a lot.
anyway, no matter what happens,
I'm going to work really hard to prove that...
I'm a good person.
no matter what happens?
Ted's telling Kristin everything tonight.
and I just...have this sick feeling that they'll choose Emma over me.
it's possible.
Yeah, um...
the way I deceived everyone, it's more than possible.
but something else could happen.
they could forgive you.
what are you saying?
I'm saying...that I forgive you.
you engineered it all.
everything that's happened.
and it all went down like clockwork.
you know, you got a pretty vivid imagination for a cold-blooded killer.
but this blows it, doesn't it?
you wanted me on the run, to spend my life as a fugitive, so they'd never look for the real killer.
honey, come on.
we've been down this road before, haven't we?
not this road.
isn't it amazing how far we'll go to protect the ones we love?
I'm ready to tell you what I couldn't tell you before.
I talked to the girls...
there's something that you should know.
something you should have known months, even years ago.
it's about Sutton, and you should really...
Oh my God, Alec.
I just, I wanted to talk about it. I... I couldn't just... let it go.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
but I am worried about it.
after tonight, I have no idea what my life will look like.
if I stay here, or... or leave...
but I...
I just, I don't want things to end badly between us.
I still want to be friends.
okay?
I think you should go now.
Thayer - I mean it.
could we please just talk about it...
you need to go. Go!
now.
I'm s... I'm sorry.
the Maiden and the Wolves
the border?
the echo. It's from there.
one missing. Whose was the black cub?
mine. But I hit it. It flipped like a pancake.
it won't last a week alone.
it's maddening.
who's this clown?
the madman.
my wolves!
stop!
get off me!
not kill my wolves! No right!
drive! - Not right over him!
we'll vouch for you!
my wolves!
stop!
what happened to you?
you're bleeding?
not bleeding. Wolves bleed.
they attacked you?
your son attacked wolves!
this... My wolves!
Emile? You saw him?
saw him! Customs too.
if he comes back...
stay out of it. I'll see to it!
go back up. And wash, you're ridiculous.
off you go!
if Emile comes back.
let's go.
daddy!
where are they?
in the yard. Hanging high.
I got that one, right in the head.
is there a black one?
they're the worst.
these are all grey.
black wolves are rare.
my grandma told me about one and a shepherdess.
it would suckle her.
and she let it!
they were found one day... stuck together!
they were both burned at the stake.
if Dad stuffs them carefully, once you're a vet, maybe you can bring them back to life.
enough, Angele! Go to bed now.
you and your wolves...
Antoine will be a soldier like my father.
vets have to blow in horse's behinds.
do soldiers kill wolves?
no.
in the Russian campaign, my grandpa said wolves followed them to eat the dead.
wolves are smart.
maybe, but you aren't. She'll have nightmares now.
go on up to bed now.
'the Wolf leaves it then and looks at us
the knives jammed in its side to their hilt
pinning it to the grass bathed in its blood
our rifles surrounded it as a sinister crescent it gazes at us again, then lies back down
while licking the blood smeared on its mouth
and, without knowing its end
closing its large eyes again, dies without a cry "
perfect for nightmares!
Madeline, it's by De Vigny!
the great Alfred de Vigny!
good night.
come on.
Antoine, are you asleep?
there's a wolf in my room!
you're mad!
and he'll get worse!
come on...
he has lovely eyes.
never look a wolf in the eye!
it'll hypnotize you and kill you.
him? I doubt it.
Cachou. We'll call him Cachou.
when I grew up, I'll be a vet.
impossible. Girls can't be.
I'll marry you and help you.
sure...
enough of this climb and your talk.
we'll let him go here.
give him a kiss. - Why?
to know you when he grows up.
if he makes it.
where to? - If he survives.
why leave him here then?
he's got a nerve! He just peed on me!
he's marking his territory.
I'm all wet now.
we shouldn't abandon him.
if this is what vets do, I'm not marrying you.
Oh, come on...
the alarm bell! It's war!
come on, quick!
it's not for you.
it's for Giuseppe.
come here.
wait.
all black, just like coal, Carbone.
for Giuseppe.
come on.
it's like the cattle market.
excuse me.
how will the little wolf manage?
it's better for him, like mother said.
present!
on August 3rd, 1914, the day war was declared, I thought only of the tiny wolf we'd abandoned.
at this crucial moment, men were so busy slaughtering each other, the last surviving wolves had a brief respite.
in a few weeks, my mind replaced the lead soldiers that mother drew for the Garcin plant with real soldiers whose massacre was suppressed.
a dazzling success that made Garcin & Son a fortune.
in autumn 1918, with the German lines crumbling, victory seemed imminent.
eager to fight,
Antoine signed up the day he turned 18.
mother, proud, moved heaven and earth for him to be in the artillery.
he died on the last day of the war when his gun exploded.
a fault in the steel or defective ammunition...
we never knew.
eaten up by sorrow and remorse, mother died of grief a few years later on Christmas Day.
my dear Angele...
a ray of light in this dullness.
the victory Song " . in three sizes.
nearly 2, 000 orders. A huge success!
like hot cakes. Come on.
our misfortunes inspired the Garcins.
always ready to adapt, they launched a flourishing line in war memorials.
30, 000 towns were in mourning.
and, naively, I played along with their game.
is this a wolf? - It's a dog, you fool.
rabid dogs attack children, not wolves!
father, the Pasteur advertisement would be more effective with a wolf.
more dramatic, more sales.
you killed all the wolves, idiot!
she would make a lovely Marianne.
are the wolves back?
they can easily invade France again.
you see, Angele, wolves are rather special.
the others, zilch.
but the others want to. So they get killed or leave for another territory, giving us the lone wolf of the steppes, howling for a mate with the same problem.
and that does it!
Angele, come over here.
that's what they do.
at this rate, they'll soon reach Brest!
and, with the war, their numbers are on the rise.
and you didn't profit from the war? Leave the wolves be!
stand here, with your back arched.
your chin up.
your bosom thrust forward, scorning the enemy.
tits against Fritz!
the flag in one hand...
point your finger.
nice and straight.
lie at her feet, bayonet fixed, nice and warm in her skirts. There!
we'll change his head.
sorry, but symbolically
antoine's is better.
a fine Marianne...
I have to undress?
no, just your bosom.
you embody the homeland.
the motherland feeds its young!
father didn't say I'd pose naked.
of course you will!
imagine! Brother and sister united for liberty and remembrance!
try to understand her.
I can wait outside.
go on, get out now.
beautiful like ancient art.
it's ancient modern art!
one snap!
it's in dubious taste but...
if you insist. Why not?
one snap!
about time.
fire!
come on beauty, spread your legs.
it's for science!
what's wrong now? - You knew?
what? - The pose. Half-naked!
tits against Fritz!
that's funny?
it's amusing. I bet that was Emile.
not very smart but amusing.
he's an idiot!
they've always helped us.
these boards are an order from Emile.
so I have to pose?
I do what I can.
you're still under age and...
we should only have boys. Girls are too ungrateful.
right...
you're not going to wind me up too!
lift it!
father!
go home now, father.
come on. Just a second.
look...
stylish, isn't it?
the " bitches " linked by chains...
my idea. - Excellent.
and Antoine, at the top of the list.
let's go, it's raining.
he thinks we're stupid. It's in alphabetical order!
don't be so negative.
chronologically, he'd be at the bottom.
the very last.
poor Antoine.
what?
magnificent!
my dear Angele... Magnificent!
you're as beautiful as your statue.
how's the nursing?
you're qualified now?
Congratulations.
I have an idea.
father needs a nurse.
a personal nurse.
he's fond of you.
excellent idea. Your mother and I...
impossible. I have to study.
more?
study to be what? A head nurse?
a veterinarian.
for animals you mean?
women aren't veterinarians!
but they will be. It's what Antoine wanted to do.
I'll be the first to do it.
a rough, thankless trade.
you'd need to shoe horses and oxen.
you deserve better.
imagine yourself with your arm up a horse's rear end.
is cleaning old men's sores any better?
you'll do as I...
no, as I say. I'm over age. From today.
I'll study again.
that's what they call a modern woman.
blacksmith? That's modern?
no idea.
a female vet is modern.
happy birthday.
did my father remind you or yours?
a good mayor is a good father for his citizens.
mayor, mare. More horses.
you modern young people can joke together.
I need a drop of wine to think straight.
I have to watch him.
Angele. Don't run away.
I should like to see you more often.
we're made for each other.
I have a few assets.
unite our families that have suffered so much and have so much to share.
and to gain.
I'll think about it.
emile can't understand why you want to study but he lent us his car.
in mid-winter, he lends us his invalid father's old car!
too bad your mother isn't here.
love requires passion.
at first. But it doesn't last.
reason always wins out.
if it's turned out, I clip...
no, I heat-stamp the inside?
No! Outside branch if it's turned out.
if it's knock-kneed, keep the outside thick.
pad it out.
Yes, I knew that.
it can be balled, widdershins or stumpy like me.
take the hind hoof.
the hind hoof!
grip it between your legs.
they're more skittish.
hold on, lass.
the other end...
hammer it in.
watch out for the live flesh.
an apprentice with balls needs two years.
one with a crack will need four. To shoe rocking horses.
get to work.
I've tried everything but, quite frankly, she's not cut out for it. Take her with you.
maybe she'll do better.
I said it was no use.
this is a boys' school.
the smith is a good man, patient with women, but there's a limit.
but, sir, vet isn't the same as smith.
a vet tends mainly to horses.
horsepower is in cars now!
the dung machines have had it.
they've had it?
three million horses in France have had it?
I prefer wild animals!
in that case, turn in your smith's apron and get to the zoo or a circus!
you'd look lovely in a tutu!
Honestly!
a short rein. She's a hot-blooded filly.
gentlemen, tea time!
bloody buggery!
are you Mr. Morzov?
the name's Zhormov. My boss.
I'm Anatole, mechanic.
delighted. - Nasty.
it's nothing. - Get it seen to.
no time for that.
all right?
fine, but if I don't mend this baby, I'm dead.
the big cats' supper.
that sounds scary! Where is this monster?
in his cages, back there.
stand back, idiot!
those jaws can tear you apart!
you don't know their power.
300 pounds per square inch, 42 razor-sharp teeth, 12 incisors...
angele Amblard, veterinary nurse.
count Zhormov. Igor.
Russian. The great Russia.
explorer and trader.
specialized in big cats.
for circuses and zoos.
delighted.
they're aggressive.
very special animals.
not look them in the eye!
you don't know the wolf. - I do.
these American.
very aggressive. Better for business.
so...
you're a veterinarian.
almost. A nurse for now.
I'd like to work with big cats.
I can treat men but I prefer animals.
what a pity.
a pity?
that you don't prefer men.
I wouldn't mind dining with you, tete-a-tete.
eye to eye.
you're very charming.
not really. l need work.
judge me for my skills instead.
sorry, Miss. No time.
I'm off to Greenland to find his brothers.
so farewell, Miss.
polar bears in Greenland?
I'll come with you for free!
that's what the plane's for? - Of course.
low-altitude scouting over the ice, pursuit, exhaust the animal and then net it!
a real net.
like trout? With a net? By plane?
take me with you!
I'll dine you with you every night at the hotel!
in the igloo, you mean. At minus 30, on raw caribou meat, surrounded by Inuit trappers who stink of foxes?
think it smells fresh here?
you'd last two hours, not three months.
glad to have met you. Goodbye.
straighten up.
there. That's it!
that's good!
perfect!
it's magical. - Hear the music?
it's like Mozart!
in 1918, the Storks Squadron...
I tuned all their pianos.
just one bullet for the Krauts...
the Germans...
it had to purr like a kitten.
Hispano Suiza. 8 cylinders, 12 litres.
never heard of it?
and you get a choice! Wheels on grass, skids on snow!
all my own work.
impressed? - Absolutely!
you have a wonderful job.
help me. I want to go to Greenland to find bears.
my thorough bred isn't some old nag.
I can imagine. I'll help, I'll learn...
that bird's back. Ripe for plucking!
fix the slide lever.
I only have two hands.
take me along. We'll make a good team!
you're back? Very sure of yourself...
too good to refuse.
I was watching. You fly like an ace.
take me too. I trust you.
I'm from here.
if we go this way... - I'll meet your parents?
no, you'll see where the last wolves live.
wild ones.
not your stinking ones.
it's near the border.
I read up on polar bears last night.
'Arctic " is Greek for " land of bears " .
my dear, bears are my department. I know them.
Ursus maritimus, 9. 8 feet long, 900 pounds.
they're left-handed.
left-handed? Bears?
you saw one sucking its thumb?
ask the Eskimos.
beware of left hooks. There's a trick...
I'll save the rest for the igloo.
for our tete-a-tetes.
even with the stink.
is that mine?
we're the same build!
the St Marcel field is snowy.
ideal for the skids.
there's an inn there.
if she gets cold, she can warm up...
under a quilt! - Shut it, Anatole.
where are we? - Here.
it can get rocky.
want a good bit of spin, boss?
go away, you pigmy!
like the girls at Jo's dancehall.
three spins and they're hot.
ignition.
follow the train line!
it looks so different!
isn't that your town there?
follow with your finger. - I can't find it.
I'm frozen!
I said to wear gloves.
that's my home down there!
and the Poisses plateau behind it.
could you try to land?
I can't find my gloves!
shit!
here are gloves.
so where are these fresh smelling wolves of yours?
no one has seen them.
just fur and droppings.
wonderful!
stop moving like that.
can't you turn normally?
this isn't a handcart, young lady.
if you have to vomit, do it outside because I'm just behind you.
land!
I'm going to die!
hold on tight!
hold on!
hold on!
leave me alone.
you must get out.
can you lean on it?
fetch my father.
leon Amblard, in Plombieres.
where are we?
Where's the map?
this is no map. It flew off.
flew off?
but I need a map! How can I manage here?
I'll leave you my pistol.
careful, it's loaded.
and vodka.
don't sleep, little kitten. Don't sleep, little swallow.
sleep and you die.
I'll come back soon with father.
I promise, kitten, then we'll go to chase bears in Greenland.
but don't sleep, all right?
don't sleep!
he was seen here. Plombieres...
then heading for Italy.
but he was due back an hour ago.
he's flying her on her back, holding his joystick!
looping the loop even!
or he's gone wild.
Venice...
the Danieli...
it looks bad.
don't be afraid, I'll come back.
Mr. Prefect?
useless. A bit of snow and...
what is it?
sorry it's so late. Can you wake the mayor?
I'm the mayor. Come up!
you're the mayor? I'm the plane.
has the search started? - In this weather?
my map! That's my map.
the girl had it. What an idiot.
the girl?
she sticks like glue.
from around here too.
pretty.
if they're all like her, this place is good.
spare me your comments.
this plane and girl, why did they come?
she nagged my boss to bring her.
she wound him round her finger. A real daredevil.
a wolf-hunter...
what are you talking about?
unusual, I know. But the last wolves are here.
so they came by airplane?
absurd!
sir, we found this fellow by the thermal baths.
bloody hell! Boss!
he claims he landed with his glider in the pines.
there's a girl too. And wolves.
have to move.
go find injured young woman up there.
daddy here.
her father? Here?
his name?
first name Angele.
Angele? Amblard?
injured?
among the wolves?
we mustn't alarm her father.
she's my...
we're getting engaged.
engaged? To you?
Congratulations!
my friend, you must be very brave.
more wolves than in all of Russia up there.
you must go!
I recognize this. We're on the right track.
we know the track.
this is all my land.
soon, we'll get up here hanging from a cable.
Yes, a cable car, Mr. Aviator!
in total safety.
this place is Siberia.
there's blood.
human blood.
a woman's.
wolf fur...
they fought over her!
in Siberia, wolves drag caribou for miles.
couldn't you have carried her?
she was in pain.
she was safer, wrapped up warm, with my gun.
I don't understand.
they always leave something. A shoe...
there are no tracks. The wind covered them.
what about the madman?
of course!
come on!
it's totalled. If you'd seen it fly... A real gull!
it's matchwood now, pal.
open up!
I saw smoke!
you're on my land.
here Mr. Albert's.
my father. Same thing.
break it down!
about time.
there's been an accident.
an airplane landed below here. Did you hear it?
a young woman is missing. Seen her?
not see her. I sleep. Quiet.
it's cold!
what a stench!
it reeks of wildlife.
your mother?
listen to me!
Where's the old woman? - Left. Italy.
cold here. Mamma old. Sick.
where are the wolves?
they attacked a woman. You know that?
no, not possible. Wolves good, kind.
wolves gone too. Gran Paradiso, like Mamma.
gran Paradiso...
he thinks I'm stupid!
no, moujik, wolves big.
mouths like this. They attacked me.
not possible. Gran Paradiso. Many wolves.
don't act smart, Macaroni!
his plane lands, a girl vanishes... And you don't hear a thing?
you think I'm stupid, you bastard?
what's this? Whose is this?
not touch. It's Mamma's.
I swear, I see nothing.
not see girl. I sleep.
see Mr. Albert.
you'll see him.
but I'm the mayor and this is my land.
when the snow thaws, you're out!
I'll burn this hovel down.
and we'll slaughter every last wolf up here!
why get so angry with this poor moujik?
search the mountains instead.
who's stopping you, Mr. Explorer?
but don't stop us locals from doing our business.
it wasn't the madman.
he's a funny looker.
these people are bad luck.
she's mine!
go! For Giuseppe!
gift from Mamma.
they can't have found only this.
they have to keep looking. Drag the torrent.
I don't believe it.
wolves never attack humans.
except in stories.
she was armed, near a fire. It doesn't make sense!
you have to search the mountains!
our men have been everywhere.
be realistic. An icy night up there, injured and exhausted, she probably fell asleep in the cold.
the wolves came later.
what did I do to deserve this?
why was she even in that plane?
he's responsible.
or, rather, irresponsible. Exactly, sir!
I told you, she insisted.
shut up! It's her fault now?
I'm overwhelmed. I'm truly sorry.
please accept my condolences.
condolences?
that's too easy!
respect our loss at least.
get out of here.
go!
that fellow deserves a good hiding.
you shouldn't treat a stranger like that.
spare me your advice, father.
you're responsible too.
you were stubborn.
things had to stay put. The wolves, the madman up there, making his home on our land...
look where it's got us!
Angele, my beloved, dead! Devoured by those monsters!
father...
Mr. Garcin?
he shouldn't drink!
give us some air!
don't shoot the wolf, sir.
trap it.
Georges, my fellow!
get over here!
how long will it take you to make fifty of these?
I'll need a week.
get to work, then.
you're sure?
I'd stake my life on it.
put your weight on it.
on the plate.
go on, do it!
go on, I said!
no good. Too taut.
he can get away.
they can move on three legs.
they lick the stump to heal it.
wolf drool is the best.
no, it's better when the jaws bite deep into the flesh.
it tugs to get away and it pulls his pants off.
down to the bone.
it gets infected and then after that, bingo!
and strychnine?
that comes first.
you hang carrion from a branch over the trap.
you get a rabbit, you skin it the same way then dress it again, its pockets full of strychnine.
strychnine... The best poison around!
the whole wolf empties out:
guts, liver, lungs, meat, the lot!
believe me, Mr. Garcin, my wolf traps, you'll love them!
sir...
Giuseppe.
you're the...
the madman.
Yes.
Giuseppe!
and Mr. Zhormov?
and the rescuers?
already come. Not find.
the wolf found.
and Giuseppe.
who undressed me? - Giuseppe.
treated and washed.
you washed me?
washed well.
washed well. All clean!
and my clothes?
whose is this?
Serena's.
your wife?
mamma.
very pretty.
dance with wolves.
Mamma... Can I talk to her?
can I see her?
please.
I'd like to dress.
on my own.
I'll dress on my own. Can you go out?
Carbone... My brother.
excuse me.
what is it?
medicine.
milk, absinthe, poppy and gentian.
Mamma's!
can your Mamma look at my leg?
giuseppe already look. Well treated.
I'd prefer a doctor.
can you take me back down?
you'll be paid.
no, not possible. Stay with Giuseppe and wolves.
certainly not!
I have a family.
I have a father. And a fiance!
they must be thinking I'm dead.
dead, good! Very good!
get peace that way!
what's your name?
Angele.
like Agnello, lamb.
wolf found Agnello.
destiny!
wolf stronger than Agnello.
cry a little.
no one hear Agnello cry.
always wolf that decides.
if Agnello live...
or die!
Agnello for wolf.
very pretty but don't you have anything else?
Mamma...
when Giuseppe little,
mamma danced with the wolves.
the kiss!
look out!
what are these big ice cubes for?
not cubes. Ice blocks.
when it's hot, sell them in valley.
that's all over now.
today, they use electricity to make ice.
why electricity?
I know electricity. Not good. Too expensive.
much ice here. Not expensive.
but with electricity, in the factory, they make ice all year.
same thing. Now I make ice and I keep it here.
more ice than in factory.
come on...
my brother and I saved one like that.
a tiny black one called Cachou. Maybe it's him.
him, Carbone. You'll see.
the family.
Bianca.
Marco.
Luigi. Matteo.
and Carbone.
saved as a baby by Angela.
Agnella.
for Giuseppe.
they have Christian names?
Yes. All baptised.
children of God, no? - And Carbone isn't?
he is.
we called him Cachou.
it was sweeter.
it looks at us again
then lies back down licking the blood from its mouth
not knowing how it perished
closing its large eyes
dies without a cry
alas, thought I, race of men I feel shame at our stupidity
how to leave life and its woes ls what each animal knows
to see what we were and what we leave
only silence is great
the rest is weakness "
go!
Agnella...
present.
thank you.
please...
you not leave here.
I must.
giuseppe not handsome?
fiance?
I don't have one.
so stay. Stay here!
marry Giuseppe! - I can't stay locked up here!
I have to leave.
you want to leave, so see Carbone.
he's waiting.
go on.
sleeping.
sleeping. You're out of your mind!
Why?
keep her a little.
but she's dead!
dead! She's gone now!
you can't keep a corpse like this!
she has to be in a cemetery.
not possible a cemetery.
if they know Mamma dead, they throw me out and kill wolves.
Why?
not the paper, Giuseppe.
not French!
Mr. Albert gave paper for Mamma.
what paper?
come...
how are you, dear chap? - He's very well!
he uses his cane. One knock for yes, two for no.
what's he saying?
Yes. He agrees.
thank you, Rosette.
after all, it's just a proxy.
with extensive powers though.
you know, I can't construe his explicit consent from knocks.
father put up the money for your practice.
am I wrong?
well, it's fairly simple.
here in blue, we have your property, some 2, 000 acres.
including, here in brownish yellow, 93 acres of the so-called Serena Corazzi concession, a plot of land for which we shall need to add an exclusion clause.
Exclusion? - Temporarily.
until the end of the lease.
your poor father unwisely granted...
how long?
for life.
whose life?
the beneficiary's.
Serena. - She's left.
we must certify that.
I already did. She's left for Italy.
only her bastard's left up there. So that's it.
no more concession.
prosperity that makes you prosperous too.
each generation of businessmen brings its stone to our community.
its stone? You must be joking!
cartloads of stones! To build hotels, restaurants...
I've seen them.
I travel, you know. St Moritz...
Chamonix last year... The Olympics!
they understand. They call it white gold.
we can't fall behind.
we either move forward or back.
so listen carefully. To get up there, I'll build a railway.
Rack-and-pinion. The term sounds beautifully metallic.
no more bronze, we switch to steel.
each village only needs one memorial.
I have 300 families to feed, Father!
that greasy wop up there is out.
he's a stain on my snowfield!
this is the future.
and this...
is the past!
I understand.
well, Mr. Garcin...
initial each page and sign on the last one.
serve us some tonic wine, please.
with a straw for father.
there.
cane.
you've read the deed? - I can't read.
no " Giuseppe " in it.
I'm sorry.
forgive me, it's...
it's your hair...
I'm sorry.
she was beautiful.
beautiful.
like you. I know.
Garcin. He sculpted me too.
Mr. Albert... Kind...
who was your father?
a wolf.
I'll take this to Albert Garcin.
he's my godfather. He'll sign a new lease.
after, you come back?
Yes, I'll come back to teach you to read.
look...
Mamma...
here you go.
I have loads of others.
they'll love these.
I'll make you a necklace of wolf teeth, to put hairs on your chest.
thank you, sir. Kill them all!
Yes, every last one!
goodbye, son!
goodbye.
I'm seeing the engraver to get a plaque for your daughter.
there must a curse on us.
Albert ordered this.
there, I've told her.
in spring, I'll take him up there to lay a wreath on the site of the crash.
not very reasonable but he keeps insisting.
calm down.
he's getting very difficult.
cut it out!
you're getting on my nerves, Albert!
leon, your girl...
she's resurrected!
the miracle of the wolves! Jesus, Mart and Joseph!
hurt!
my little girl...
that's godfather?
godfather, what happened to you?
he had a stroke.
we were worried sick. We thought you were dead.
the wolves and all...
he ended up all deformed.
he can't talk?
no, not a word.
I look after him. It's hard.
but we get by. We understand each other.
right, old pal?
I bet no one will believe your story or that the madman took care of you.
but it's the truth.
he's an excellent bonesetter.
he could do it for a living.
with another face, maybe. Quite frankly...
you get used to it.
you should have seen mine when I woke in his bed - stark naked... - Naked?
what do you mean, naked?
Angele, did he abuse you?
he could have but he didn't.
he's a decent boy, despite what you all think.
could you go out while I dress?
brilliant!
you're naked in front of some animal but I have to go out.
I'm going but you're going to see a doctor.
I don't trust your bonesetter.
did you see his crippled mother?
Yes, but she's not really well.
emile said she was in Italy.
you can come back in.
did you see her dance?
she was a fine specimen too.
very shapely.
a real tigress!
she'd drive men wild.
with Satan's kiss?
a pretty witch.
come on...
the kiss!
kiss her!
who was the father?
there was no end of possibilities!
some women said it was a wolf, others that it was your godfather.
but Albert never confirmed it.
he was married at the time.
he had Emile too. - He's in love with me.
I know, I told you months ago.
no, I mean Giuseppe.
Giuseppe?
what do you mean?
I want you to forget that ape and wait for Emile!
he's modern and he has land!
between some scarecrow and a true man of vision, it's not hard to choose!
Giuseppe...
Bravo, Carbone.
mamma, they're born.
she's dead, godfather.
he's alone with the wolves.
help him or your own son will hound him out.
he has no one left.
his father... Who was he?
do you know?
Emile...
she's in the garden with your father.
please, godfather!
I have to know.
my dearest Angele! What an affair!
father!
her return has cheered you up.
he looks wonderful.
your father told me some shaggy dog story...
you were saved by wolves?
what a joke. Good old Leon.
all that ether and formalin he breathes in...
or his Jura wine, has gone to his head.
tell me everything.
your return revives me.
I couldn't sleep or eat...
I'm living again! We all are!
we searched everywhere. Even that hovel!
he treated me well.
when we came back down, the mood was leaden.
leaden, for a steel maker...
that's funny.
it was doubly hard for me.
as mayor, I had to be strong, so the populace wouldn't panic, while mourning for my dear friend.
the papers even mentioned a fiancee, I hear.
your fiancee?
we were nearly there.
nearly, maybe, but we still had a long way to go.
so let's get started!
look!
a rack-and-pinion railway. Slopes at 15%%%.
5 miles of track. 1, 500 sleepers per half-mile.
and here, a cable car.
that'll be a lot of steel.
I met the Rothschilds in Megeve.
very friendly!
they'll take a share and I'll provide Garcin steel for their line to the top of Mont Blanc.
a train to the top of Europe. Brilliant!
the factory will get rich. So will I.
and so will you.
not even a word of encouragement for me?
I realize all this metal won't delight a nature lover like you.
but this will control nature and make it accessible.
with you at my side, to advise me, to guide me, to calm me if need be.
I have a very modern idea of a wife's role.
and what's this?
an Indian reserve?
look here!
I won't let a few wolves and some gypsy stand in my way.
the cripple's vanished and the mad snowman barely exists.
there's no trace of him anywhere.
at school, in the army. He's a ghost!
you could sort all that out.
as mayor, can't you...
you don't regulate irregularity!
he chose liberty, not equality and fraternity!
he saved my life.
your father thinks not.
but yours protects him. What of fraternity?
no fraternity!
we're of different blood.
don't imagine things my father never said.
respect the old man. He has the right to peace.
he suffers enough.
and the wolves? They saved my life. What do they have a right to?
the wolves? Open up a zoo.
two wolves, three marmots, a chamois. For the tourists.
a small menagerie will make money.
it's impossible.
wolves will keep tourists away.
the peasants are patient but only so far.
the wolves are through.
never again.
I've ruled on the question.
it's a matter of weeks.
days even.
all right.
but let me take over.
I'll see to the wolves and the gypsy, as you call him.
I just need a little time and money.
and they'll leave.
I swear.
just a loan and...
you get your ice cave free of wolves.
in my eyes, you'll earn the value and humanity that I expect...
of a future husband?
ten days.
and 1, 000 francs.
and no haggling.
1, 000 francs is a lot.
my value in your eyes is priceless.
you'll be pleased, Mr. Garcin.
we've trapped a male. He's at the customs post.
good, Jacob. I have a job for you.
you hussy...
you don't waste time.
cheating on the boss as soon as his back is turned.
and you, Blackie, you'll make a nice rug,
jacob style.
it'll be a miracle if she walks again.
she has to live a few days for her cubs.
to make milk, she has to eat.
giuseppe think of that.
rabbit for Bianca.
are you all right?
did you catch it?
it's full of strychnine.
they'll wipe you out one by one. First the wolves, then you.
Marco, Luigi, Matteo Not come back. Three days.
probably dead by now.
you have to leave. Fast!
and Mamma?
Mamma...
I'II see to Mamma.
but you have to leave...
with your wolves.
I have news. - Come in.
two bits of news, in fact. One good and one not so good.
I'm listening.
two other wolves, stone dead.
and a big black one soon.
I've tracked him down already.
perfect!
and the bad news? Spit it out!
I did what you asked.
I followed her all the way up.
the madman ran up like a madman!
he started kissing her and cuddling her and...
enough!
did she struggle?
like hell! She was the same!
taking his head in her hands, snogging him...
you're lying!
you asked me to tell you exactly what I saw...
go on.
I'd have taken a closer look but something cropped up.
what cropped up?
a wolf.
the big black one.
he's trained to guard the shack.
so? You had your rifle?
you asked me to be discreet.
there's nothing discreet about a rifle, sir.
I'll leave for Italy.
with Bianca, the cubs and Carbone.
gran Paradiso. To find other wolves.
what if I want to see you again?
don't you want to see me?
if I want to see you, I close my eyes.
don't move!
giuseppe and Carbone vanished before my eyes.
I waited until dark.
all the hatred and violence could have overwhelmed me but they just made me stronger.
universal Menagerie.
are you sure? - At the airfield.
for that lady eaten by the wolves.
it's ringing.
booth four.
Mr. Zhormov, please.
I didn't recognize you.
you have to come here.
I need you. I have a favour to ask.
you're going too far this time!
can't you give up now?
never, you hear me!
she's mad.
let people talk.
you can't raise a wild animal.
and wolves are wild animals!
it can work.
they'll die.
too bad. Or rather good.
they're condemned anyway.
they need space. They need freedom!
Mr. Zhormov is taking apes to Turin.
we'll leave them on the Gran Paradiso.
hopefully, they'll find a mother.
the Gran Paradiso.
they can go to hell instead.
they've had a good feed.
I filled the can for the trip.
we agreed on 50 each.
200 for the four.
you're not paying that much?
twist your nose to get milk. - What?
in Russian too, women fed cubs whose mothers had been shot.
but for free.
and they had a revolution.
keep your fancy words and cough up!
to tell the truth, women confuse me a little.
I don't understand.
don't try to understand them, just love them.
that's not bad.
I'd play the orphan cub with her.
look at her hemispheres!
come on, drive!
titties are nice to look at.
say hello to Benito.
you can take the ape through.
thank you.
very smart.
france's last wolves vanished around this time before returning from Italy in 1992.
the first female veterinarian qualified in 1931.
the Making of South Park 6 Days to Air - Okay. - Let's do it.
if we go down to this... either end, see, you can get it.
keep going. Keep going. Keep going.
you know what I mean? - Yeah.
like this, right? - Yeah, that's good.
so we're talking to you? - Yeah.
okay.
comedy
we have an amazing show tonight. Oh, my God.
the creators of the legendary animated series South Park,
Matt Stone and Trey Parker!
south Park's never been Matt and I sitting there going, "Okay, what's offensive?"
what can we do that's offensive?
Oh,"herro" "prease.
we just are sort of offensive people, so...
red rocket. Come on, dog. Red rocket.
you watch all four days of the Democratic convention...
on Wednesday night, I had to watch South Park, so...
Oh, this is hot scissoring. Scissor me timbers.
all right, I'd like to solve the puzzle.
niggers!
all the bad in society, it's our fault. You can blame us.
now how about we do some scripture readings from The Book of Mormon?
they have a new musical opening on Broadway that is getting rave reviews.
it's called The Book of Mormon.
been here in New York for 2 1/2 months.
this is opening night in about, what, an hour?
south Park seems like a million miles away.
but we start into South Park in two weeks.
we're really stupid.
this was the longest break we've ever had in between runs.
it's been quiet here for the last few months.
welcome
it won't be any longer here shortly.
well...
knowing we have seven shows coming up and we don't have any ideas for them yet...
that's typical, but to go back to South Park is gonna be really hard.
there's this documentary being made on South Park, so that starts shooting now.
let's go to the bathroom, boys. Bathroom cam.
Oh, I probably should, actually.
Trey - I'll have... - Want to get that little mini detail for 75?
Yeah. Yeah. - Okay.
just give me the keys. I'll just give 'em to you.
what's your name? - Trey.
Trey, I'll take care of you, what time you leaving today?
5 in the morning, probably. - Okay.
it is kind of our mission every morning to go in and come up with ideas and jokes.
writers' room is off-limits.
I will only bother the writers' room if there's something that has got to be dealt with or answered right on the spot.
man, we got to do seven episodes.
we never had cameras in the writers' room.
Yeah, I mean, it's a really... It's kind of a safe place.
for all the good ideas that we get, there's, like, 100 not-so-good ones.
the Japanese Tsunami, which isn't funny at all, but there is, like...
every... a couple days, it's like, a new video comes out, 'cause so many people were everyone has a video phone.
it... you just... it looks... Oh, it's terrifying.
anyway, so Tsunami video? Tsunami show?
not super funny. - Real funny.
and you got to feel safe to just go,"What about this?" And it's like, people go,"well..."
you go,"okay, you know, I don't take any offense. You didn't like my idea."
and you got to feel like... it is kind of... It's weirdly vulnerable.
I've had friends that worked at other shows, and if you say something that doesn't work, they're like,"ah, that sucks. You suck. You're not funny."
and these guys, it's actually a very kind room, and I think, like, the worst you get is,"okay."
the way that they work is definitely, like, having fun, laughing, chasing that, and never making it, like, a grind.
it seems like movie trailers make you feel stupid these days.
Hello, you. - Kevin James is a Zookeeper.
go see it, asshole.
that trailer. - Talking monkey? In a m-m-movie?
it's gonna help me g-g-get laid?
Kevin James is a Zookeeper. Fuck you.
he's about to get married. Fuck you.
I'm a squirrel. I can't talk. Fuck you.
pirates of the Caribbean forty fucking eight. Fuck you.
you'll notice that a lot of the people that work here, they'll be going, walking by back and forth, and they're always kind of...
cause they know, the more we're laughing in there, the less hours they probably have to work in here.
they walk by, there's no laughing, and Trey's doing this and I'm pulling out my hair...
and it's 3: 00 in the afternoon, and we should be done.
you know what's getting a lot of traction in the last, like, maybe six months is how fucked up the NCAA is and how fucked up it is that players don't get paid.
they're playing on ABC on Sunday in front of, like, 20 million people, and they can't afford to fly their mom to the game.
you look in the crowd, and everybody's white.
all the athletic directors, everybody's white.
all the players are black. Or most of them are, you know, 90% of them are black.
and you're like,"dude, you're selling their image, like, on video."
you're signing video game deals.
when I first met him, we had just seen Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Matt, like, really hated it, and he was kind of going off about it, and he was like,"it was like a rape."
he just kept saying, like,"the movie was like a rape."
and then... and while he's saying this, like, Trey's just kind of, like, pacing around, and then Trey just goes, "okay so the boys are coming out of kingdom..."
and then it was just... it just started... it became...
I was like,"Oh, my God. This is becoming an episode."
why are they doing this?
they're just taking Indiana Jones, and they're... They're raping him!
I can't watch! Let's get out of here, Kyle.
why would Spielberg and Lucas do this? - Come on! Let's go!
why are they doing this? - Just run!
so then what if Cartman starts a lucrative business of getting crack babies to play basketball?
and he videotapes these crack babies... It becomes really big, but he doesn't pay the crack babies anything.
Stan's mom volunteers at the hospital where she holds crack babies.
then Cartman sees a really great investment opportunity.
the most successful businesses in America "don't pay their labor."
don't you understand, Kyle? - "It's slave labor."
I see; You're gonna represent the crack babies against me.
how much money are they paying you, Kyle?
no, I'm doing it pro Bono. "What"?
you're doing it just to get a fucking boner?
you know, it'd be fine... if you were doing it for money,"I'd understand, but just to get a boner, Kyle? Jesus Christ."
just to get a boner.
there's a show on this Wednesday.
we don't even know what it is, and, like, even though that's the way we've always done it, there's this little thing going,"Oh, you're screwed. You're screwed."
and then I tried to get a diversion and play a little Xbox last night, and a big ad for South Park came up on the Xbox.
you know,"Starting Wednesday." And I was just like,"Oh, shit."
just can't get away from it.
let's do this. Let's go till 11: 30 trying to come up with something completely new.
then from 11: 30 to 12: 30, we'll pick which of these shows we're gonna do, and we'll come up with a scene for that, and then we'll be done.
a whole another show.
last night, I went onto iTunes, and that thing came up again that's like, "your iTunes is out of date," you know, which happens every time.
God damn it. Here it goes again. I got to download another version of iTunes.
how many times have I hit "agree" to that, and I've never even read one line of it?
it's like,"Kyle's in trouble. We got to help."
he's like," Fuck Kyle. I don't care."
it's like,"dude, he agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions." Like,"Oh, my God. Get him inside."
the joke is that everyone always reads that except for Kyle.
even Butters is sitting with him.
whoa, you...Well, how can you agree to something "you didn't read, Kyle?"
never, ever, ever click something without reading it.
I said 'disagree.'
because then Stan even showing up at Cartman's house going,"we got to hide Stan."
and then Cartman's like,"why?"
and it's like,"he agreed to the fucking iTunes terms and conditions."
God damn it. - "Did he read it?"
I happened to be downloading the new version of iTunes for the 400th time, and it was like, clicking on that "agree" thing. I'm like,"oh, you know,"
I wonder if there's anything really messed-up in here that I'm agreeing to.
then we had this parody of Human Centipede that went into it.
and then you start to... "Oh, wait, this is actually starting to be something."
just draw a little Kyle hat on that second one.
there's just Kyle in the middle just getting fucked. aaa
let's just do a profile shot first, just sort of what it really looks like in Human Centipede.
let's see that as the side shot, and then let's also see it basically, like, Japanese guy head-on with Kyle kind of peeking out back here and then her back here, if we decide we're gonna go that route, we'll probably build a walk cycle for it.
you know, sort of...
so I got them corel'ing the real version.
whenever Cartman comes in, just... It doesn't matter what's going on in the story.
he just has to have brought the front guy a huge cappuccino with six extra shots.
he just brings him a huge coffee.
I've learned that men really super...They dig poo.
it's like, the goes in here, out the fucking ass into this mouth.
in this fucking ass, up this mouth, up into a cloud.
down in the mouth, out the fucking ass of this person.
just upload all your stuff to the cloud and then down into your fucking asshole.
go to shit to his mouth and to his ass.
the Japanese man could have to talk for the whole centipede, you know?
it's like,"What do you want to do, Kyle?"
he said he want to, you know?
just whisper into my asshole.
you know, generally, like, it's a good idea if everyone in the room is laughing and then Anne Garefino is kind of looking a little bit like,"hmm, really? We're doing that?"
when they shit into each other's mouths, we're not gonna see feces in the iteration that I have seen so far, but I don't know what's gonna happen at the end yet. We haven't written the end.
maybe. Yes. Maybe we see them being sewn together.
Thanks. Happy Easter to you too.
Oh, I like these pastels.
more violent on the shake.
just got to match Kyle's head to the butt.
and then I got to do the same thing to his butt and her head.
in this building, you not only have to be good and diverse, but you also have to be fast, 'cause if it takes you four days to get something done, you can't really contribute.
when push comes to shove and we're in production, people just have to be able to turn stuff around.
most studios have a storyboard department, and all they do is storyboard.
then you'll have a character design department, and all they do is character design, and then they'll have a background design department, and they'll all get a couple of days or three days or so to at least do their job.
everybody in here does all that, and in 1/10 of the time of a normal studio.
usually, Simpsons and Family Guy, those shows take, like eight to ten months, and we're doing it, you know, six days.
no one does an animated show like this.
on Thursday, we get one scene. We jam it through the storyboard departments.
we get the boards drawn. We get editorial to build that initial animatic.
the guys will go in and record that scene.
Trey's the quarterback. We're kind of like the offensive line.
if Trey all of a sudden wants to do an homage to Heavy Metal, the animated movie...
appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.
okay.
we have to figure out how to do that.
if he wants to do guys bouncing on their nut sack...
I'm stoned off my balls.
it's our job to figure out how it works.
but it all starts and ends with Trey and Matt.
so sorry, Kyle, but I am starving.
which would you rather I eat?
should I eat cuttlefish and asparagus or the vanilla paste?
cuttlefish and asparagus?
very well. I will eat the cuttlefish.
you gonna do eating sounds? - Oh, yeah.
that cuttlefish and...
it's so funny. It's so stupid.
that cuttlefish and asparagus is not sitting well.
Oh, no! Cuttlefish...
cuttlefish is about to come out of my asshole!
Oh, here it comes. Oh, it's going to be a lot.
hold on, Kyle. I believe in you!
4
it's just so funny that Matt and I are in our 40s now, and we're still...
like, when that Japanese guy shits in Kyle's mouth and Kyle shits in the lady's mouth, it makes us laugh so goddamn hard, and I know it doesn't...
there's, like, a lot of people out there that don't laugh at that shit as hard as we do.
but it's just so satisfying for me, especially after going from Book of Mormon and all the...
you know, the Broadway and the accolades and all this, like... you know, and it was great.
I'm super proud of that, but it's just so funny to come back here and just do a Japanese guy shitting in Kyle's mouth,'cause it just...
it's just back to our roots, you know?
hold on, Kyle! I believe in you!
Yeah, just keep him kind of moving and shaking.
so he's like,"Oh, God. It's gonna be a lot. Here it comes! Hold on, Kyle! I believe in you!"
even though we're a partnership...
and I really do feel that way, that we each bring kind of, like, something different to the table, and it's why it's made us survive and stuff...
the way that the stories, either in South Park or the movies, are expressed is completely through Trey.
like, Trey's the chef.
Hey, you see my iPad, Token?
funny, you don't seem to have one.
I thought your family was rich!
Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it.
flatter on the... "Tom Saltzman says "Tom Saltzman says"you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it."
so keep that, okay. - Yeah.
Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it.
Yeah, that's a good one.
when we first started getting famous and stuff, "Oh, yeah, Matt and Trey, and Trey's the director. "Well, Matt...
and I got calls for, like... "Hey, you can..."
I mean, I got offers to direct studio comedies, the crap shit that I probably didn't want to do anyway, but, you know, in my head, I was just like, "you really don't know what you're doing."
like, don't you know what I mean?
like, yeah, maybe I could go fool people for a little bit, and maybe I might get lucky here or there with a scene or two, or I might pull off a little bit, but it's not in my DNA.
I don't have that competing skill set, so whatever I've got channels through him.
like, it's just like any time that you get a band, you can sit there and be like, "okay, well, it's all Eddie Van Halen."
but as soon as David Lee Roth leaves, you're like,"fuck that band."
you know what I mean? And it's like...
you know, and Eddie can sit there and say, "well, I write everything"，
and it's like,"yeah, but you're not Van Halen without David Lee Roth.
bring in Matt.
where I can get in and be tough is exactly where Trey's not, and where he can be tough is exactly where I'm not.
that's helped us in the business of the whole thing too.
are we talking to each other?
you can talk to each other... - That'd be really weird.
you know, you won't get in an argument with Trey.
Trey's not gonna argue with you about something, and I'll argue about your everything all the time.
Yeah, it's not gonna feel right. I'll tell you.
us talking to each other is not... We don't talk to each other like that.
you know what I mean?
I'm not trying to throw a wrench in your thing.
if you want us to look in the camera and answer questions, we can do that.
so this is the camera? Which one's the camera?
the middle. - The middle one. Okay.
Trey and Matt's the band, and no matter who does what or whatever, that's the band.
we're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
The...There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle.
Oh, nope. Here it is right here.
by clicking 'agree,' you're also acknowledging that Apple"may sew your mouth to the butt hole of another iTunes user."
really broke.
they broke at a bar, and so I did this little thing with a paper clip, and see how it's all swirly?
people think it's a fashion statement.
I was renting a studio apartment, and I had a little futon on the floor, and Matt slept...
would kind of get all his dirty clothes together at the end of the day and sleep on those.
any money we had was to live or get our own thing going.
we created this thing called The Spirit of Christmas on VHS.
people started copying and copying, and that became this, like, viral video, but before the Internet.
it's crazy now to look back at Spirit of Christmas.
you're like,"what the fuck is that piece of shit?"
it's crazy. - So shitty.
tomorrow is my birthday, yet all is not right.
your birthday is on Christmas? That sucks, dude.
I must find a place called "The Mall."
well, we can take you to the mall, Jesus. - Yeah, it's over this way.
we'd have people call us and say, "dude, you got to see this thing. I'm gonna send you this thing."
and we're like,"that's ours."
and then we had people... 'Cause we didn't put our names on it.
that was another thing that drove people nuts.
we found out people were getting jobs saying that they did it.
dudes were getting directing jobs, commercial jobs, and we just, like, had no job...
they're like,"we got the guys that made Spirit of Christmas."
and we're like,"we made fucking Spirit of Christmas." They're like,"yeah, yeah."
we pitched it to FOX, and we actually made these big things with construction paper on 'em, and I was so proud of it. It was like a school project.
the woman at FOX at the time was like,"yeah, no."
you know, what people want to see in animation is, "they don't want to see kids."
they want to see families.
and we're like,"well, we can get into the family."
you know, we've got... Each boy could have their family, and that's...
and she was like,"no, yeah, it's just not gonna work."
we went to Comedy Central with it.
music from Primus opens South Park, and from there, four eight-year-old boys and other crudely drawn characters will rock your world.
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
you bastard!
the highest-rated television show on cable for more than a month...
you go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
south Park on Comedy Central, an instant cult hit and cultural icon.
screw you guys. I'm going home.
good, you deserve to die, you little bastard!
Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your genius.
lip
this is all for the pilot.
so they'd put this mouth on, and then they'd shoot, you know, two frames of film, and then they would take that mouth off, and then, like, they would dab it like that.
that's how sometimes they'd get coffee on the teeth.
it took the guys two to three hours to do one shot, and it took pretty much all summer to do the pilot.
no, kitty. This is my pot pie.
no, kitty. You bad kitty. No, kitty, it's my pot pie!
mom!
this is where Cartman gets the anal probe, and it's when that bright blue light comes in.
you know, he's laying in his bed right here.
it's mostly Trey's style from high school and drawing.
the style comes from his passion of Monty Python and the style that Terry Gilliam did in Monty Python.
you know, it was still animated, but you didn't have to draw every frame.
he'd just draw our characters, and some of the comedy comes from the crudeness of the animation.
wow, this is great.
boy, those look shitty.
like, this is our original panning shot for the cafeteria.
Yeah, so the frame would be like that, you know, so we'd pull the camera way in.
depending on what was taped down and what wasn't taped down on the animation side of it, that would bring these characters to life.
like,'cause as you're, you know, changing the mouths or putting on different eyes, your character would have a slightly different bump and a little jiggle to it.
it's still stop-motion animation.
it's still someone moving Cartman over and going, "key frame."
it's still just frame by frame and a bunch of really talented people looking at every piece of visual art and doing it really fast.
Oh, what should I do on my iPad next?
so instead of coming from back here, start him here, side view.
and he's like,"Kyle, what should I do next?"
and he's still doing his thing.
Kyle, wow, what should I do next?
Oh, man. Should I email some friends? Or maybe I should buy some apps.
then turns and then goes this way.
so he'll have a little bit of front view where he's like...
3
Oh, wow. This is totally awesome. Tap, tap, tap.
there a season where you made the decision, like, "we're gonna start turning it over in a week?"
no, it just started happening where we would do it in two weeks.
and then we would do it in... "Oh, my God. "We just did a show in ten days.
I can't believe... that was crazy.
and then it was like,"oh, my God, seven days."
and then it was like,"oh, my God, we just did it."
and then it just turned into, like, we just do a show a week, and it just kind of got there.
technology got to the place so we could do that too.
15 years ago, we were using $30, 000 desktop boxes that were really specialized, and even they were, like, creeping slow compared to now.
we just have Macs off the shelf.
so basically, the show can keep up with as fast as we can go.
time to kick off the road to the 2011 Tony Awards, Broadway's biggest and brightest night.
the Book of Mormon leads all shows this year with 14 nominations.
so happy for you, Trey. - Yeah, it's good.
Congratulations. - It's good.
Congrats- Thanks.
celebrate by working all day.
yay, fun.
I was thinking the chick on the back could be Lady Gaga, 'cause then you could put her in, like, a sweet costume.
she's the one to agreed to it on purpose, 'cause this is her new... It's her new lipstick.
kirstie Alley. That's pretty funny, right?
we're gonna make it an actress, right?
Yeah, I was thinking of making it some actress, like...
they've said " fuck you" to every celebrity pretty much, which they were doing before the show too.
they would fart on celebrities at parties, and now they do it on the air, and the celebrity smells it.
Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, all right? You need to come out.
what's going on?
Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall.
you know, at SNL, it's like, "well, we might want that person to host."
"do we want to pick on that person?" Or,"that person is already mad at us because of..."
you know what I mean? There's all political reasons.
get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.
all right, I'm nearing her snizz now.
what they want to do in being funny is just, like, that's it, you know.
like, that's the priority. That's like...They don't worry about anything else.
Ah, my nipples, they hurt! They hurt when I twist them.
Oprah's vagina has killed a police officer and taken several people hostage.
ms. Lopez, we're dropping you from the label.
Oh, no, you didn't.
mostly, it's just 'cause that's their personalities, to be like,"fuck everybody," 360 degrees.
Trey got nominated for Blame Canada, and so I think I went as your date, right?
so it was like,"well, you can go with Trey's as a plus one," and he didn't have a girlfriend at the time, and he was like,"you can go as my date. And I was like,"oh, that's funny.
so then it was like,"well, wouldn't it be funny "if I shaved my legs and dressed up in a fancy dress "and tried to pass myself off as some weird-looking, "tall, European..."
eastern European model or something?
we talked about, like, big duck outfits, and we're like,"well, if we go in "with big duck costumes, they're not gonna..."
then they have a reason to not let us in, "but if we're wearing what other people are wearing, then they really can't say,'you can't come in.'
friend of ours had sugar cubes with LSD.
that's so crazy now to think, like... - That's so nuts.
the whole idea...I mean, even to just go, "okay, you're gonna go to the Oscars... Take acid and go to the Oscars."
I'd be like,"no, dude, I'm not doing that, 'cause I don't know what I'm gonna end up doing."
that'd even be too scary.
they have all these streets blocked off, 'cause you have to go through the biggest limo line in the world to get dropped off.
and it was like, we finally got up to the front, and we were both, I think, going,"oh, shit."
if you've taken acid, you know that one of the trippiest parts of when you're on any psychedelics is transitioning, when you go inside to outside or outside to inside.
you know, like, that, "oh, we're in a different space."
I will never forget the moment getting out of the limo, and there was, like, 60, 000 fucking people and every camera in the Western Hemisphere there, and it was like,"let's go!"
right now, we're gonna go downstairs to...Kind of simple and kind of elegant?
I don't know. - Doubt it.
tell us. - Okay, talk about a fashion statement.
now, two of you are nominated for best song, Blame Canada.
Matt's not. - I'm not.
we said,"we can't say anything about them."
nothing about the dresses. - No matter what they ask us.
so everyone would go,"guys, what about the dresses? Why the dresses?"
and we'd go,"magical night tonight. Just all the stars are out."
is that why you're in the dress?
it's just such a magical evening, and everyone...
it's just, everyone looks so spectacular.
you know, we just wanted to be a part of it all. - It's a night of magic.
come on.
only thing we could have done a little bit better is, we could have put powdered sugar all over our noses.
just to have been totally like,"fuck you."
I also remember, actually, then having to sit there in the actual Oscars, and you're coming down off the acid.
so you're simultaneously coming down, and you're having to now sit through the Oscars, which suck.
there were people there that were like, "dude, this is my big night. fuck you."
that was the funniest thing to us. We're like,"really? "Like, this is fucking bullshit.
it's Hollywood. Like, let's rock, you know?
but we don't have any friends anymore. I wonder why.
I think that maybe now what we should do is fill in all of the blanks we need...We have to fill in.
we are in danger of doing our typical first show thing where we've just got way too many ingredients.
we haven't introduced the idea of apps at all or anything, and that's why whatever this thing is at the end is gonna have to be so fast.
I'm just worried about time.
you know what I mean?
and not one of our whole other ideas, but, like, one of the other character's storylines.
we just feel like the Cartman being pissed off about not getting his thing...
like, him going home and screaming at his mom, saying, "you fuck me,'cause now all the kids think I have an iPad," and I've got to show up tomorrow with nothing.
because everyone thinks I have an iPad.
cause I told them 'cause I don't have one. That's how fucked you me.
cause you didn't get me one!
she's like,"well, we can get you something, "but it's gonna be your birthday present, you know, for next month.
and he's like,"that's... okay."
then they're at Best Buy, and he's all happy. And he goes over...
okay, Wi-Fi Plus 3G, 64-gig. This one! This one!
Oh, sweetie, $900?
and she's like,"well, no, Cartman. Let's get these,'cause..."
toshiba Handibook? Fuck you, mom.
and he gets all...
it's $200, and I'm willing to get you one.
he's like,"why don't you just wear a condom if you're gonna fuck me."
you want to fuck me, mom? Just say so. Go ahead. Here.
go ahead, mom. Fuck me. Fuck me right here in the Best Buy.
and it just cuts to the car, and he's crying.
I'm sorry.
Oh, does 'fuck' mean something naughty?" "I'm just a little boy."
why did you go outside to a police officer and say, "help, help, my mom is trying to fuck me"?
Oh, wait, I get it now.
the "F" word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people.
I'm sorry, mama.
if you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything.
well, now, that doesn't really have any logical sense, mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad, mama.
Oh, wait, I get it now. The "F" word is a no-no word.
Oh, wait, I get it now. The "F" word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people.
I'm sorry, mama.
if you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything.
this place is built around them being a completely self-sufficient operation.
there aren't shows that have been 220 episodes of the same people writing it, directing it, doing all the voices, watching every shot, every frame, and they also preserve that outsider status.
instinctively, I think that helps you to be funny, is to not have an allegiance to any organization or whatever.
I think that's one of the reasons why... It's taking so long to do.
I think someone just farted into the P. A. System.
and so I guess there's a good chance that was Trey, but I don't know.
so it's Monday at, what, 6:10 P. M?
I'm pretty scared right now, 'cause I'm up to 28 pages, and I still have one, two, three, four, five scenes still to write, and so...
and each scene's about a minute long usually, so this is gonna end up being about a 40-page script,
I think, which just means it just becomes brutal, because you have to go back in tomorrow and start...
as you're coming up with new stuff, then you've got to start taking scenes that are there and figuring out, "okay, how can we make this same thing happen in half the time and rewrite it?"
and I sort of always call it the rule of replacing "ands"with either "buts" or "therefores,"
and so it's always like,"this happens, and then this happens, and then this happens."
whenever I can go back in the writing and change that to, "this happens."
therefore, this happens, but this happens...
you know, whenever you can replace your "ands"with "buts" or "therefores,"
it makes for better writing.
the only note I have on this week's show is "pussy" and "fuck" and "shit."
so do you want to bleep it, push it, have me ask standards? What do you think?
I think we should try to see if we can get "pussy" and lose fuck.
okay. I'll see what I can do.
"fuck" is not funny. "Pussy..."
all right.
it's so fucking ridiculous, but that actually is the way we do things.
now, the whole Cartman through-story in this is about Cartman getting screwed.
he gets screwed by his mother, by Dr. Phil, by everybody, and finally, at the end, he gets screwed by God.
I need my ass lubed up if you're gonna me, God!
or how about you just moisten my ass with your tongue first, huh?
how's that, God?
could lick my butthole before you fuck me next time?
standards said,"maybe not."
you can keep that line, but you just got to be a little less explicit about explaining what that is.
so I'm just kind of waiting for Trey to rewrite it, and then I have to send it in again.
no. No. This show wouldn't... no.
it's like yo gabba gabba! By comparison to what we do now.
go home, you little dildo.
dude, don't call my brother a dildo. - What's a dildo?
Ah, yes.
dad? - Randy!
Oh, there was a ghost.
there's ectoplasm.
we're always surprised, too, by... Sometimes in a week, we're like,"dude, could we really do this?"
just like most women out there, I've gotten into queefing lately.
there's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays.
what we're gonna do is just cut out some paper, like this.
you can cut out little stars or little moon shapes.
and then jam those up.
and then I've got some simple little sparkles from the hobby store.
see how pretty that was?
like, okay. I guess we're gonna do this. We'll see what happens.
and then nothing happens, and everyone's like, "yeah, that's just South Park. Anyway..."
that's just what it is, and so it's...
for anyone to now... and especially 15 years later, for anyone to go up and go, "did you see this thing on South Park? That was really offensive.
someone's gonna be like,"dude, shut up. It's South Park."
I hope that shit's still funny bleeped.
like what?
all that shit about fuck me and fuck me and...
the fucking animatic's hysterical the Dr. Phil thing.
Eric, you say that your mom fucked you?
Yes, she fucked me so hard.
she me fucked on Christmas. She me fucked on my birthday.
you know, mom, the least you could do is kiss me first.
if I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first.
got this massive Death Star that I haven't even taken out of the box yet,'
cause it's gonna be a beast.
sometimes to get my brain working a different way,
I'll just sit there and put legos together,'cause it just...
you got an instruction book, and you just sit there, and you do exactly what something else tells you to do instead of you having to tell everybody what to do.
and it's just therapeutic.
but I did that one last run.
and actually, you can turn it on. It actually walks.
it's pretty sweet.
McDonald's. I got it.
chicken nuggets, and always with sweet and sour or hot mustard.
big Mac? - Yeah.
and how does McDonald's affect your creativity?
it doesn't.
I just makes me happy for, like, five minutes,'cause I get...
I hate writing so much,'cause the writing part of it is actually so, like, lonely and sad, you know,'cause it's just...
there's that thing. I know everyone's waiting for me to, like, get it done, and, like...
and just that little battle of fighting over lines and, like, trying to figure out what the best way to say certain things are, so I just hate it so much that a little bit... It's just a little sunshine.
no, he's not.
I'll find him. Okay.
the search for Trey.
so what's going on with this show?
what I'm hearing is, is that there's a bunch to write, so I anticipate that we'll go real long hours.
so we need some pretty significant cuts.
Yeah. - Okay.
almost every week on Sunday or Monday, I'm pretty bummed out.
I'm pretty much just like,"ugh."
and then I kind of get a little better on Tuesday, maybe a little bummed out, and then Trey gets really bummed out on Tuesday.
we kind of hit our lulls or whatever, but I'm always like, Sunday, Monday, I'm like,"oh, my God."
this, the show, this thing sucks.
terrible. I'm embarrassed for putting this piece of shit on the air.
a lot of funny stuff's just gonna have to get cut out.
you just can't have a show where "A" to "B" doesn't make any sense.
and I'm bummed,'cause I know, based on what I've handed over and everything, it's not gonna be a 5: 00 A. M. day. It's gonna be a 9: 00, 10: 00 A. M. day.
beginning of act two is that;
then we come back, and that's when it's, "okay, the Geniuses are gonna see us now."
and then, act three, we just start with the unveiling of the thing.
and then we go to, they're doing the bubble thing, and Gerald flips out, joins Apple.
we're back, and that's it. - That's great.
Yeah, that actually works.
Hey, script's here, guys. Hey.
Oh, thanks, Rick.
to keep the action balanced over here, she's back here.
Yeah, right now, we just got... I just dropped in the audio.
we're pulling the storyboards.
I was in a hurry, you see, and I didn't know what I was agreeing to.
I can't even read Engrish.
see...I want to redo these lines all wild.
do it wild. I just want to get 'em again.
I just clicked "agree." I-I didn't read it.
I was in a hurry, you see, and I-I-I didn't know what I was agreeing to.
Yeah. That's good. - Great.
it's okay if he starts out...
well, no, that doesn't really have any logical sense, mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad.
mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
No!
well, then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner?
cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been fucked!
come on.
we'll get you separated, little boy.
guess you won't be eating Japanese food for a while, huh?
12
Oh, no, don't make me "raff." Don't make me "raff.
I always feel like, "wow, I wish I had another day with this show."
that's the reason that there's so many episodes of South Park we're able to get done, is 'cause there just is a deadline, and you can't keep going, 'cause there would be so many shows that I'm like,"no, no, it's not ready yet. Not ready yet.
and I would have spent four weeks on one show.
all you do is start second-guessing yourself and rewriting stuff, and it gets over-thought, and it would have been 5% better.
why did you do this to me, God?
next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey?
cause I like to get lubed up before I get fucked!
the draft is ready, but that's the only part.
that 's it we yeah you - Okay, good job, you guys. Excellent. - Thank you.
do this to the camera. - For the camera.
I think it's a good episode.
it's really twisted, but Trey can't see it that way.
Trey won't be able to see it that way today.
wednesday morning, after finishing an episode, he never likes it.
I mean, that's good.
the first couple episodes, we actually delivered a couple days early.
we don't do that anymore.
it was a little bit sloppy and reckless, but sometimes, especially after something like Book of Mormon, we just got to get back in that way, and hopefully the shows will get a little tighter as we go.
got 18 minutes to have this tape feeding to New York so that they can begin roll.
is that excellent. Great
all right. See you again next week.
all right, you guys. Thank you.
one down. Six to go.
Hello, Detroit.
what a pleasure to be here.
ladies and gentlemen, we in the exciting field of dental supply sales are here in the Motor City for a reason...
to provide quality, precision tools to professionals who demand the very best.
thank you.
Whoa-ho-ho, thank you very much.
please be seated.
Oh.
I was just going over my speech.
you've been going over it for two weeks.
honey, you know your speech. I know your speech.
the kids know it. - It's a big one, Susan.
it's a speech for every sales rep in the Northeast United States.
it is a big one.
you've done very well for yourself, Andy Fiddler.
now get dressed. Your plane leaves at 7: 00.
you know, Detroit's quite a sports town, honey.
maybe I'll bring you back a Piston.
do me a favor. Just bring yourself back.
detroit ain't Wisconsin.
60 AR-15s, 30 M-4s, 6, 000 rounds of 5-5-6 ammunition and three dozen M-16s, all of it stolen from the vault in this building.
but that's not why I rolled you out of bed at 5: 00 a. m. Agent Vann.
you wanna tell me how your partner winds up a speed bump on the 94 Freeway? I'll tell you how.
your partner was the inside man on the job.
once they had the guns, he became a loose end.
I'm gonna tell you something else, something I've learned in 20 years with Internal Affairs...
if a cop's dirty, nine times out of 10, his partner's dirty too.
wouldn't surprise me if you were the one who popped him.
you got a bug up your ass about me?
well, let's get it out right now, right here, you and me.
no, huh?
so step off, stop wasting my time.
you don't seem too upset about your partner.
you want to charge me with not being upset, go right ahead. Be my guest.
hell, I'll write a full confession about how I don't give a shit.
if he was dirty, he got what he deserved.
I'm not finished with you.
well, I'm finished with you, and let me tell you what I learned in all my years on the job...
don't trust anyone.
that includes partners and especially Internal Affairs skid marks.
I'll be seeing you, Vann.
I tried to keep I. A. Off your back.
booty. Mmm, don't get into this.
I'm already into this.
you know those weapons will be out of the city within 24 hours.
Yeah, well, you can't set up a buy in 24 hours.
watch me. - Vann, nothing stupid.
Yes, Lieutenant.
Bye-bye, enjoy your stay. Bye, hope you had a nice flight.
I had a wonderful flight, and I'm wondering if you can do me a favor.
I was talking to one of the stewardesses back there, and we were discussing tongue scrapers. I found one in my bag.
I'm wondering if you can pass this along.
I'm a dental supply salesman. - Yes, I will.
sir, you might have to step aside.
just tell her it's daily tongue-scraping and anti-bacterial conditioning which will assure her the freshest breath.
see this right here?
this is a nickel-plated Ladysmith nine Mary-Mary chrome inlay. Go on, - feel that. - It's got a nice weight to it.
Yeah, so do you, baby. - What?
Oh, shit! - Oh, hold up... that's a cop car!
get your ass off my car, Booty!
come on!
your ass is still on my car, Booty!
run faster, Booty! Pump those arms! Get those knees up!
your form is all jacked up, dawg! - What you want, man?
I want to buy some guns! - I don't know - what you're talking about! - I'm talking about a telephone pole.
what?
why do we have to do this every time?
it's these repetitive ass-whippings that cause guys like me - to burn out on the job. - Du... ah-ha... ah!
somebody wiped out our vault last night. Who was it?
how the hell should I know? - I'm gonna check the front of my car.
if it smells like ass, I'm gonna beat you like a runaway slave.
no no, all right, all right, all right.
all right what? - Maybe I heard something.
tell me what you heard.
something about a lot of merchandise in play. That's all.
Ooh. You know how I can tell you're lying?
I can smell the bullshit coming out of your mouth.
no, all right! Maybe I know one of the guys, huh?
well, hook me up. Tell him you found a buyer.
Oh, man, he already got a buyer. You're too late.
tell him I'll double his price. I can get 20 grand cash right now.
20 grand? Man, that'll only get you a taste, dawg.
a taste is all I need.
$38. 50. - That was very nice drive in, Mr. uh...
is it Bedwetter? - Bedwe-teer.
I see you're from Turkey, Mr. Budweeder.
I've got $20, $40. There you go. Keep the change.
I was in Turkey recently, uh...
santos, what's cracking, dawg?
yo, I need 20 grand. - Yeah, don't we all?
I need that in non-sequential unmarked bills, and I'm in a hurry.
I'm not your personal ATM, man.
come on, Santos.
you know you're gonna give it up, so cut the bullshit.
Hey, I don't have that kind of cash down here right now.
Nuh-uh. See? You're lying. Now I personally logged a million in cash into that vault right over there just last month on a case we both know hasn't gone to trial yet, so you're still holding.
what happened between us, Santos?
where the love, dawg?
you realize it's my ass if you come up short again.
it's just flash money. I'll have it back this afternoon.
come on, now go and get that.
I'll have the paperwork done by the time you get back.
all right, but I need that money back here by 4: 00.
you can trust me, man.
come on now. I'm in a hurry. Chop-chop.
work that combination, baby.
look, man, they'll give you a taste, then they'll tell you where to bring the money. They don't want the goods and the cash - in the same spot. - Booty, I do this for a living.
look, I don't know these guys. They're from out of town.
what do you know, Booty?
this is the place, man. He'll give you a gun and a phone now and call you later for the money.
take the corner seat at the counter and be carrying a "USA Today." A "USA Today," the newspaper.
look, man, I did what you asked me to do. I'm done with this.
you better hurry up, man.
by this time tomorrow, the guns will be gone.
you want a taste? - Pardon me?
there's your taste. - That's my taste?
wait for our call.
Hey!
what?
he's got a gun.
no no, this is not... No no no, it's not my gun.
it's the man that was sitting here he j... he just left.
Oh oh! He's got a gun, man!
it's going back in the bag. Back in the bag.
drop the gun! - Ah!
drop the gun! Now! - Yes.
Yes, the gun's going down. - Drop it!
the gun is going down. Gun is down.
gun is down. - Just shut up.
all right. Ah!
you picked the wrong day to pull a stick-up, dickwad.
it's not my gun. Some guy gave it to me.
what guy? - Some guy. He gave me a bag, - and he said, "Taste it. Taste it." - He said what?
something about a taste. - Tell me what he said, exactly word for word what he said.
he said, "That's your taste," but there was nothing to taste, just a phone and a gun. Look, I just went in for a cof...
Oh shit. They think you're me. - They think I'm black?
no, they don't think you're... A. T.F.
you're coming with me.
what? I have done nothing wrong!
well, Simon? - It's coming.
all right, I got him.
fiddler, Andy. Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
he's not federal, he's not local, no law enforcement.
no sheet. He's clean. - Yeah, he's too clean.
screw him. - No, wait a minute.
istanbul, Turkey. Customs.
trafficking." - Turkey? He do any time?
Interpol shows an outstanding warrant. - He got away from the Turks?
no shit. This guy's gotta be smarter than he looks, huh?
well, he can't be any dumber than he looks.
so what's this guy look like?
well, he, uh... he had very good teeth.
what does he look like? - He looks good. He looks good.
he had a very nice face, very handsome face.
he was a very attractive man.
n... not to me.
uh, I mean, I am married to a woman.
and even if I wasn't married,
I don't mean that kind of attractive. Personally, - he was not attractive to me. - Describe him to me.
short hair. Short hair which made his head look smaller than it actually is, and I only mention that because I've been told my head is somewhat large, and when I looked over at his, it's like... you know when you look through binoculars the wrong way, it-it-it looks...
that's you. Answer it!
hello.
Turk. - Just a moment, please.
can you believe this? - He wants to talk to the Turk.
that's you. - That's me?
that's you. - I'm the Turk?
look at you.
this is the Turk.
okay, listen, Turk. When this phone rings, you answer it.
you understand? - Yes, I answer it.
you and you alone. Are we clear? - Me and me alone, right.
great. Now listen, you put the package in the trash can on the northwest corner of Fort and Woodward in five minutes.
hello. - So what did he say?
something about a package and a trash can.
look, I have nothing to do with this. I'm here for a convention.
I don't give a shit.
now what trash can?
fort and Woodward.
Whoa!
take this package, put it in that trash can, and you can go.
I should point out to you, sir, that I am taking a mental picture of you just in case there's...
any... trouble.
Hey, you know what? Th-this... this is not for you.
who's it for?
well, it's... it's, uh, for somebody else.
who? - Just someone.
someone you don't know. - Try me.
no, I'm not trying you. This is not garbage, okay?
this is business, so just please don't touch it.
all right, give me the bag.
give me the bag. - Oh, Jesus.
it's not your bag. See what he's doing?
he took my bag. - Who is this guy?
this bag is mine! It's not his. - Damn!
okay okay. What is the matter with you?
just let me go. All right. - Get up. Get up!
get in the car. Get in the car! - I think we should...
we should look for another can.
what the hell is the matter with you?
I ask you to do one thing, and you screw it up.
hello. - What the hell's the matter with you?
I ask you to do one thing, and you screw it up.
Yes, well, this was not planned well.
no no, listen, Turk. You know what?
you just bring the package to First and Bagley and wait there.
so what did he say now?
Hey, get back here!
excuse me.
now you pay.
get off my car!
get down! Oh man, he's got a gun! Ah!
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh, boy! Oh!
Ah! Ah! Ow ow ow ow!
9-1-1. What's your emergency?
Yes, hello, I've been shot. - Can you give me a location?
I don't know. Downtown. - Where downtown, sir?
a man in a black car kidnapped me.
do you have a license plate number?
Yes, just give me a second.
347DNB." Hurry.
I just called 9-1-1, - and you are in serious trouble. - Get up.
you shot me. - I grazed you.
well, that's still shooting me!
watch your ass. - Ow ow ow ow!
you could have killed me back there.
if I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.
I wanted to graze you, you're grazed. It was a training bullet.
well, I'm bleeding, although you might call it "training blood.
here, use this.
taco sauce?
Yes, it's a natural antiseptic.
sprinkle some of that on your ass so you don't get an infection.
Yeah, well, I don't even wanna know how you discovered that.
so what, you keep this in your glove compartment and just splash it on a salami sandwich and then splash some on your behind?
use it or don't use it. It's your ass.
you got any guacamole in there? I hear it makes a great cold compress.
just put it back! - All right, I'll use it. I'll use it.
don't you have traffic to look at?
Oh, shit. You gotta be kidding me.
get out of the vehicle with your hands in the air!
get out of the car and show me your hands!
turn around! Hands on your head!
no no no no no, I'm not with him. - Your hands!
I don't know him! He just...
he... he... he kidnapped me.
he took me against my will.
he... look. You see?
he wanted to put taco sauce on my butt.
the guy is nuts.
nuts.
hands! - Run my plates!
you! Back in the car.
your hands! - You wanna see my hands?
here.
federal agent. Run my plates!
the car is federal, sir. A. T.F. - That's right.
federal agent.
federal prisoner. Back in the car!
you are interfering with a federal investigation.
move your asses!
that was fun.
give this to him and walk away.
Hey. If you try to run this time,
I'm gonna put a bullet in part of the ass you really need.
Ooh-ooh! Oh!
so you like the merch?
the merch? - The merch.
well, you know, there are days that I like it and days that I don't.
it depends. I'm on the fence.
do you like the merchandise, Turk? - Yes, I do...
like the merchandise.
I, uh... thanks for asking.
so there's gonna be 20 grand in there, right?
in the bag. Come on.
good.
good first step. We'll be in touch.
and, uh, one more thing, Turk...
no more fruitcake stuff, okay?
sure. - Good. Goodbye.
get in the car.
Why? - I'm not done with you yet.
you said I was done. - I lied. I do that.
now get up. Get in the car. - No.
get up!
hey... don't make me chase you.
I'm tell...
Hey! - Stop!
stop! Help me!
Hey! - Help!
you're under arrest. Hands on the car.
on the car!
who the hell is this guy?
run that.
he's international.
Ow! - Watch your head.
okay, that's it. I am writing a letter.
number 3. - Number 3.
three, step forward. Three, that's you.
that's him. - You sure?
I'll never forget that face.
all right, thank you. You can go. - Excuse me.
I'd like to speak to whoever's in charge, please.
all right, number 3, stay. The rest can go.
thank you.
boy, sometimes you just have to speak up.
are you in charge here? - Yes, I am.
Oh, boy, have I been waiting to talk to you.
Really? - My name is Andy Fiddler.
I'm in dental supply sales, and believe you me,
I never thought I'd be standing here in a police station - with a bullet wound in the keister. - Hmm.
but I am extremely upset with this man here, and I must confess with your whole operation in general, because quite frankly, I have nothing to do with any of this.
well, that's not what it looks like, Mr. Keister.
the weapon you used in the diner, stolen from A. T.F.'s vault.
the gun you're robbing the cashier with.
Oh, no no no no. No no, there's no robbing.
I'm not robbing. You see, although I can certainly see how you'd get that impression.
we also got a red notice from Interpol when we ran your name.
there's an outstanding warrant for your arrest.
what? - Istanbul, Turkey ring any bells?
Oh. Oh, yes.
it does ring some bells, and believe it or not, there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for that, and you will find it very funny, - 'cause it's quite a story. - Tell it on the way.
place your left hand here. - So I took the family to Europe in the summer of '98, and one of our stops was Istanbul, in Turkey...
a must-see if you've never been.
anyhoo, my wife has this thing about... - Yo, Vann, phone call.
...Persian rugs. Okay, I'm not a complainer, but that officer was very abusive.
I mean, not only was he physically violent, but... but more disturbing to me, he... he was just rude.
Vann. - Your daughter wants to know if you're coming to her recital tonight.
Oh you know, I can't.
uh, I'm in the middle of something right now.
um, I gotta go. Would you tell her for me?
you need to tell her.
so when we got back to the hotel, we discovered the rug is too big for the suitcase.
so we decided to leave the rug at the hotel to be sent to us when we got back home.
turn right.
so we finally get home, but we never got the rug.
long story short, we get a letter from the hotel that said the rug had been seized at Customs.
now evidently this rug had been stolen.
it was a 1, 000-year-old prayer rug, and... and it was stolen, but how was I to know?
I didn't know, and I'm the one that's out $230.
Yeah, it was all very innocent, as I'm sure - you can now understand. - I see.
lock him up. - What?
let's go. - What?
let's go. - Get him out of here!
what? Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
this way. - I have done nothing wrong!
come on. Move it. - I have... l... l...
I haven't... I haven't done anything!
yo, this is the number to this phone.
I want you to put a trace on it.
I want the owner and an address. Call me when you got it.
okay.
lieu, you looking for me?
explain the Wisconsin kid.
I set up a buy with the bad guys, he got in the middle of it, - now they think he's me. - So you're telling me - the guns are still in play. - Yeah.
how do you know this isn't a setup? - With this guy?
Yeah, with this guy. - Not with this guy.
okay, where is he?
he's in holding, and he's gonna stay there.
Yes, Ma'am.
shit. They ate him already.
Caucasian gentlemen. Big glasses.
Oh yeah, didn't have the heart to put him in there.
Ah-ah!
thank you.
come on. - So, am I free to go now?
go? Oh, hell no. They're fixing a shit sandwich upstairs, and you're the mayonnaise.
possession of a stolen weapon, armed robbery and the Turkish government wants to have a little chat with you before we're done.
okay, I want to talk to an attorney.
I get one phone call, and I want to call an attorney.
let me lay your options out for you here...
you can come with me as a Suspect Who's Cooperating, or you can stay here and get married tonight.
so what's it gonna be? - Okay, just so we're clear...
I am not choosing to go with you.
I'm choosing not to stay with them.
Uh-huh. - Okay.
hang on.
this is one screwed up crew.
all right, just so there's no confusion, here's the deal...
you're in my world now, not yours.
and in my world, your responsibilities begin and end with me.
and what would those responsibilities be?
well, these guys think you wanna buy guns from them.
I need you to meet 'em one more time and set up a buy, - so I can bust their ass. - Okay, I am developing a slight phobia about meeting these guys. The whole meeting thing, quite frankly, is getting irritating. I have to be honest.
look, I have done everything you've asked me to do.
why can't I go?
what does any of this have to do with me?
because every time these guys meet somebody new, they're on the lookout for the Man.
and you most certainly do not look like the Man.
Oh, I don't look like the Man.
well, thank you, because that clears up absolutely nothing.
who... who is the Man?
the heat, the pig, the po-po, 5-0, the undercover agent that's gonna bust their ass.
you're such a white bread son of a bitch, these assholes trust you.
well, you know, people do trust me.
that's not a compliment, shit stain. - Okay, you know what?
why do you swear so much? Do you think it makes you sound tougher when you just swear all the time?
fuck you. - Okay, that's good. That's really good.
really classy. You know, I could go around all day saying, "F-U. F this and F that and F-ing this, you mother-F-er.
but I don't because there has to be some civility in the world.
incidentally, there is a trick you can use to curb that habit.
every time you feel like saying the "F" word, just go ahead and say it, and then add, "Crying out loud.
and before you know it, you're saying, "Oh, for crying out loud.
Oh, boy. Well... - You did make her a promise.
you always break your promises to her.
you want your daughter growing up like you, not trusting anybody?
that's not the point. - It's exactly the point.
no, it's not.
you promised her you'd be at her recital tonight.
something came up.
you know, my little girl's a ballerina too, and she's exactly your age.
Really? - Yeah,
I help her with her pirouettes all the time.
that's not what this is about.
this is about you not wanting to go - because her stepdad's gonna be there. - Oh.
is he dancing tonight, too?
and with the right feet positioning...
there you go, okay. Well!
Yeah, that's good.
daddy, can Andy come with you tonight?
um...
look, honey...
daddy can't come tonight. I'm sorry.
but I promise I will be there next time. I swear.
I'm gonna make it up to you.
hold on.
look, Daddy's gotta go, okay?
go ahead. Goodbye.
it was very nice meeting you, Kate.
you too. - So what you got?
the owner of that phone? - Yeah.
it's Cortez. Manny Cortez. - Who?
Katie. - Thanks.
come inside, sweetheart.
cortez's is back elevator, second floor.
Oh, shit.
don't get up. - You scared me, man.
what are you still doing here, Cortez?
you were supposed to meet us at the warehouse over three hours ago.
do you mind? I'm, uh...
I'm in the middle of something here.
I truly don't care.
Hey, look. There's too much heat on those guns, all right?
I mean, you killed a cop. That was not in the deal.
Yeah, well, he became a problem.
listen, we got the merchandise.
you need to pay us for it.
I'm out, all right?
I cannot do shit with those guns. - You know what, Cortez?
that's your problem. You got the money or not?
find another buyer, all right?
and you know what? I suggest you get out of town as quickly as possible.
Hey. Yo. Close the door on your way out.
sure.
well, I guess that just leaves the Turk.
I guess so.
well, you've got a very nice family.
you've just got a wonderful daughter - and a lovely wife. - Ex-wife.
ex-wife, yes, well, she seems like a very nice person.
Yeah. - Yeah, so... so...
so it just didn't work out, huh?
well, whatever.
would you like to see my family? - No!
well, I would like to see my family.
this is my oldest... Hannah, she's 12.
I'm trying to get her interested in the dental equipment game, but I guess at that age, you know, it's just not cool yet.
this is my little ballerina right here.
and this is my wife Susan, holding our newest addition... Emily.
just turned 2. Already talking a mile a minute.
just talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk. A regular little chatterbox.
I wonder who she got that from. - I think she got it from me.
you think? - Oh...
well, I am, uh... I'm sorry about your... situation.
what situation would that be?
well, you've got people who love you, and yet you seem like a very sad and Ionely man.
I'm not Ionely. - Well, I think you're Ionely.
I'm not Ionely. - Fine, you're not Ionely. You're alone.
Yes, I'm alone, but I'm not Ionely.
it's two different things.
does the expression "No man is an island" ring any bells?
does the expression "Shut your ass up" ring any bells?
what now?
I have to go visit a friend of mine.
can I go with you? - No.
Oh, well, I would really like to go with you.
look, everybody in this neighborhood knows my ride.
nobody messes with it. - Okay.
~ Big booty bitches, well... ~ - Oh!
Cortez.
Manny, where you at?
you hiding under the bed again?
Woo! Manny.
A. T.F. - Yeah, this is Vann.
would you send a bag wagon over to Manny Cortez's place?
the gun dealer? - Yeah, he took the deluxe cruise up shit's creek...
compliments of a. 45 to the chest.
no.
Hey! Hey!
good afternoon. Out of the car.
Oh! Oh! Oh-ah! - Whoa! What are you doing?
Ooh.
Oh! - Hey!
this was not a good idea.
Oh boy! Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
drives pretty good.
you idiot! Moron!
well, you left the keys in the ignition.
not the smartest thing to do for a policeman.
this would be a good time for you to be quiet.
I know that's nearly impossible for you, but if I hear the sound of your voice right now,
I can't be responsible for my actions.
so this would be a very good time for you to shut up!
I have a small question.
I still have a question, and I think I'm entitled...
what?
do you have a plan?
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
if you fail to plan, you plan to fail.
just a little constructive criticism, okay?
that's how two people working together help ea...
whoa whoa whoa whoa! We're not working together, so get that thought out of your mind. Nobody said - we were working together. - Excuse me.
you dragged me into this, and I'm giving a speech at 10: 00 A. M. Tomorrow, so the sooner you start treating me like a partner...
Hey! We are not partners.
ain't no way in the world that can happen.
well, what am I then? Hmm?
what are you?
you are my bitch, that's what... my own personal bitch.
I pulled you out of lockup as an S. W.C. which means "Suspect Who's Cooperating,
which means I own your ass, which means when I pull the strings, you dance.
till then, you sit there, keep your mouth shut and don't say a word like the puppet you are.
Hey, yo, Booty.
Hey, Booty, what's up, man?
let's go, come on.
pass the ball, yo. - What up?
Oh damn, man! Hey! Come on, man!
Ah! Ah... ah... hey!
booty, we never finished our conversation.
man, I told you everything I know, man!
I will cheese-grate your ass through this fence.
Oh, come on, dawg. Look, I don't know no more! Wha... ah!
all right, all right, all right! Shit, all right!
would you get that phone book over there for me?
who's this guy? - Man, I don't know his name.
look, would you get your car out of my ass, please...
thank you. ...dawg. Ow!
now who are those guys you hooked me up with?
I need names. - Man, they gonna kill me, dawg!
they gonna kill my whole family! - Names!
Ow! - Hey, just give him the name.
give him the name. - Name!
look, I can't! - Just... just let's have a name.
look, I can't! Ow! - You know what?
make up a name! Give him something!
look, there's no name here. - No, they'll kill me.
he doesn't have the name, uh...
look, all right, all right! Look, the dude in the picture, his name is...
Joey Trent, man. - Good, good name. That's a good name.
that's a good name. - No no no, that's... that's a real name!
all right, keep talking. - Look, I didn't know nothing - about no cop getting killed. - Yeah, right.
well, who's Joey's boss? - I don't know.
some dude from out of town.
then give me an out of town name! - I don't know his name, man!
Oh, shit! Uhn! - I'm out of it. I'm out of it.
look, the dude's named Kane!
the crew boss name is Kane, man. Now that's all I know, other than he have a bad rep. Dawg, look, - I swear on my Moms on that. - Who hooked you up with Joey?
man, Cortez, dawg.
Ooh, not a good sign. Cortez is dead.
man.
excuse me.
hello.
okay. Well, that was him.
you lucked out, Holmes, but we will continue this conversation.
shut up, man. - Oh, and, Booty...
watch your ass.
man, you broke my gold tooth, dawg!
where we going? - Uh, Lucky's Bar and Grill in one hour.
is that all he said? - No. No, there was something else.
what did he say? What did he say? - You're not gonna like it.
you're gonna get mad. - Tell me what he said.
he wants me to bring money. A lot. - How much? How much?
look, I'm just the messenger. - How much money?
half a million dollars. - What?
I know. It was a heart-thumper. - Shit!
where we going? - My ATM.
yo, Santos. - Thank God.
I need that 20 grand back.
I. A. Wants to look at my books.
I need some more.
are you out of your mind? You think there's any way in hell
I'm gonna give you another $20, 000?
I need a half mil.
it's just show and tell. I'll have it back in an hour.
go away.
santos, open up. I got something to tell you.
what? - Open up and I'll tell you.
what?
look, here's the thing.
you give me the half mil, I bust the bad guys and make this right.
you don't, you lose the 20 grand, and you take a shit bath for coming up short.
at least this way, you do what I ask, you got a shot.
why you doing this to me?
you trusted me.
come on.
I'm hungry. - You'll live.
no, no, no. L... l... I'm really hungry.
come on, man. - No, my blood sugar is low, and I'm feeling faint. I haven't eaten all day.
I would like some food. - Okay, I'll get you a burger.
I would rather have something else. - It's a tasty burger.
red meat...
quite often doesn't agree with me.
am I gonna make it to my speech tomorrow morning?
I don't know, man. That ain't a priority to me.
you know what?
you're not a very nice person.
you don't care about anyone, you don't trust anyone.
trust can get you dead.
trust can get you dead.
well, there's not one person - in this world that you trust? - Nope.
your mother? - Oh, hell, no.
how can you not trust your mother?
she could be playing me. - How can a person go through life like that?
Hey, at least I'm honest about it.
what, you trust everybody you meet?
I give everybody the benefit of the doubt, yes.
and what happens when they screw you over?
who's gonna screw me over?
what, do you think people are just waiting to screw people over?
you think the world is one big screw-over?
I couldn't live my life like that. I never met anyone
I wasn't friends with eventually.
well, I never met anyone whose ass I didn't kick eventually.
well, you must be very proud.
guns and shooting and kicking ass.
you know, problems can be solved without ever touching a gun.
situation: You're walking down the street with your wife, a guy comes up out of nowhere, grabs you from behind, puts a gun to your wife's head. What do you do?
bite him. - Bite him?
do you have any idea how powerful the human bite is?
the masseter muscles in the jaw can exert 600 pounds of pressure per inch, and I'm not even discussing bacteria.
masseter muscles?
it's Latin. - It's bullshit.
come on, finish this shit. Let's go.
you can afford this, right?
you all right?
I told you I have a problem with red meat.
you've gotta admit that was a good burger, though, right?
you sure you're all right?
Yeah, it doesn't last long.
Oh! Oh oh, damn! Let the window down!
Oh, it's just a little flatulence.
Oh, "a little flatulence"?
an elephant could take a shit in the back seat, - and it wouldn't smell that bad. - Can we just let it go?
Oh oh!
Oh, man!
Oh!
Oh!
all right, let's do this.
this is real simple.
show 'em the cash, get a time and a place, and you're back at the hotel giving your speech tomorrow.
uh, quick question. Uh, you can't just go in there and arrest him because why?
I want his boss and the guns in the same place at the same time. That's what this dance is all about.
here, now go.
remember, this is strictly flash cash.
show it to him, close the bag, bring it back.
now what if something goes wrong?
nothing will go wrong. - Yeah, but what if it does?
nothing will go wrong. - Uh, yeah, but what if it does?
what if something goes wrong and the deal doesn't happen?
I'm gonna be doing this for the rest of my life!
nothing will go wrong.
Hey, remember... time and a place.
a time and a place.
Oh! Son of a bitch!
hello.
Ah! Excuse me. - Hey, just checking for a wire, mate.
okay. - Oh, you're good.
well? - Yes.
born lucky. Yeah, am I good? - Okay.
Oh, I would think. I would think. Okay.
great.
good.
now...
all we need is a time and a place, and we have ourselves a deal.
and we have ourselves a little problem.
what?
nobody... nobody comes up with half a million dollars in cash in an hour.
so you tell me... who are you?
I'm a businessman. - Businessman, right.
and what kind of business is that exactly?
what business?
I provide quality precision tools to professionals who demand the very best.
period.
now are we gonna do business?
look, Turk.
I need to speak to my boss.
well, why am I talking to you, Joey?
how do you know my name?
because... I know your name.
l... I know names.
let's just say I was born lucky, okay?
you're lucky, huh?
and another thing, from now on I only talk to Kane.
look, Turk, you know, l... I can't just go and tell Kane he should walk away from a deal he already has in place just 'cause some guy that he doesn't know flashes some cash at me. You understand?
keep the money. I don't care about the money.
you think I care about the money? Don't care about it.
I can get money. Just consider that a good faith deposit.
and you tell Kane there's a lot more where that came from, but only if he stops wasting my time.
Oh, one more thing.
from now on...
I call you.
Comprende? - Comprende.
excuse me.
Where's the money? - I gave it to him.
I told him I'd call him with a time and a place, and I walked out! You should have seen it!
you gave a half million dollars in cash - to some gun-running killers? - Correct.
goddamn you!
asshole! Son of a bitch!
I've never seen anyone that pissed off before.
okay. - God damn it!
you said nothing unexpected would happen, and guess what...
something unexpected happened!
what's to stop them from taking my money and running?!
because they know they'd be giving up a lot more where that came from.
he was about to walk. I had to change the game plan, - so I'm... I'm now calling the shots. - Oh, so you in charge now?
I am indeed. - You the Man!
Yes. I am the Man.
well, what are we supposed to do now, Man?
well, I think we just let them stew for awhile.
you know what I mean? And then we call them - in, you know, a couple of hours. - Well, what do we do in the meantime, man?
we go to your daughter's recital.
Oh no.
daddy! - Hey, star.
I knew you'd come.
thanks for reminding me about tonight.
that's the first time
I've heard you say thank you in a long time.
I'm sorry. - "Thank you" and "I'm sorry"?
I think your new partner is a good influence.
you have no idea. - Andy, this is Mark.
how you doing? - Nice to meet you.
Vann. - Mark.
well, we better go.
come on, Katie. - Come on. Come on, baby.
Bye, Daddy. - Bye, honey.
can I say something? - No.
I think you're still in love with her.
and if you don't get over this, you may lose the other woman in your life.
just a thought.
you were so pretty. - Well, Barney Bunny should be in the bottom dresser drawer, honey, because that's his very own bed. Oh.
Oh, good, sweetheart, don't you feel better?
okay, honey, is Mommy there?
Hi, Susan. Oh, no no, things are fine, yeah.
Yeah, convention's going great great great.
you know, I'm... I'm the Man.
Yes, I'm going to be home tomorrow night, so I'II, uh... I'll see you then.
I love you too, hon.
Bye.
Thanks.
why don't we go ahead and do this thing - so you can get back to your family? - Really?
just do this one thing, and you're done.
okay. Question:
when you say "done," do you mean "done" as in finished, as in no more, nothing else, "done"?
make the call.
I've a question.
um, isn't it normal to have, uh... you know, some... some kind of backup, uh, for a situation like this?
I didn't hear you call for any backup. - That's right.
Oh. - Here we go.
my hands are sweaty.
just be the Man.
who's this?
well, I came to meet your associate.
this is my associate. - Well, you know what?
he looks like a cop. - He does.
he does look like a cop, but he is most definitely not a cop, so let's put that to bed right here and now.
so like I said, Turk, who is he? - Who is he?
he's, uh... my bitch.
your bitch?
he's my own personal bitch. Hey, bitch, come here.
come on, come on, come on, come on.
I pull the strings, and he dances.
is that right? You his bitch?
why don't you answer the man?
you can talk, bitch.
I want to hear you say it.
who's my bitch?
I am. - I didn't hear that. Did you hear that?
no. - I couldn't hear anything.
we can't hear. Who's my bitch?
I'm his bitch. - Attaboy.
all right, well, get in... bitch.
why don't you get in the back, bitch?
crotch-grabbing time? - Yeah yeah, we'll take care of it.
get in. - All right.
so where's your guy? - He's here.
where? - You're looking at him, asshole.
I am Kane. Eh, you can still call me Joey,
I answer to both. The real question is... who are you?
I'm the man with the money.
better yet, I'm the only man with the money.
there's just one small problem, money man.
what's that? - I think you're a cop.
Oh. Yeah, I am.
huh. - My name is Vann. Wade was my partner.
I've been tracking what he was doing from the very beginning.
could have busted him, you, your whole gang, but I was waiting for the right time.
I want in.
it's true. He's A. T.F.
so you knew about the heist, huh? - Hell, yeah.
think I don't know what my partner's doing?
how do I know you're not here to settle the score for your dead partner?
please. He played in the rain; he got wet.
so you just wait for your moment and this is it?
I can take the heat off you from the inside and I can move the guns.
you know I got the money, 'cause my man here just gave you that half million dollars like it wasn't nothing.
you're not the only one with connections, Agent Vann.
I have a buyer. - You had a buyer.
Manny Cortez. Unfortunately, somebody put a. 45 slug in him.
the same kinda bullet they took out of my partner, Wade.
now, some people might call that a coincidence, but I don't believe in coincidences. Do you?
not really.
see, I figured you'd take my deal over Manny's because you're greedy.
but now I see you're just plain desperate.
you're stuck with a truckload of guns and no buyer.
so what's it gonna be, Joey... Kane?
you've got it all figured out, haven't you, Agent Vann?
we'll see. Let's go.
enjoy your swim, ladies.
tell me you didn't pee in the pool.
wait a minute, wait a minute.
we gonna make a deal with this cop?
get in. Vin.
go. Now.
well, I guess this is it. - Yeah.
you can go back to the world of dental supply.
Oh, ho-ho yeah.
Yeah.
listen, if you want to show up tomorrow, you know, I can make it happen.
no, I'm still in the middle of this thing.
Oh, yeah yeah yeah, well, sure.
Ah, just a thought.
it's been interesting.
Yeah, well...
Hey, maybe next time I'm in town, I'll look you up.
or not. It doesn't, uh...
d... boy.
I hate these long goodbyes.
so, uh...
well... see you later.
Yeah, you take it easy. - Okay.
we in the exciting field of dental supply sales have been on the cutting edge of technology and science for many years. And especially today, be it porcelain veneers, be it dental implants that are fast eliminating the use of dentures and bridges in patients' mouths, be it the use of carbamide peroxide in combination with ultraviolet light that has cut teeth bleaching down to a one-hour- one-time visit.
Yes, we pledge another year of excellence in the field.
and finally, we are here...
to provide quality, precision tools to professionals who demand the very best!
thank you!
thank you!
thank you!
thank you.
Oh, you killed them!
you killed, Andy. - You think? Yes!
Oh! Yes? - Mr. Fiddler.
come with us.
where are you taking me? - Watch your head.
he said I was done. Uh, what is going on?
we're hoping you might tell us, Mr. Fiddler.
look, I don't know who you people think I am.
we know exactly who you are. What we don't know is how a guy like you could go so wrong so fast.
here you are meeting a gun runner from overseas name of Joey Trent.
and here you are doing the 411
with Hector Babcock, a. k.a. Booty, a gun dealer who we just found in the trunk of his own car.
you've been running with a rough crowd, but you might be confused about who the real bad guy is...
agent Derrick Vann, your new best friend.
he's the one that put the bullet through Booty's head.
Oh, no.
he wouldn't do that. - No?
no. - Check out Manuel Cortez.
another gun dealer Vann paid a visit to.
last but not least, his own partner, or ex-partner I should say.
so you have a dead A. T.F. Agent, a dead snitch and a dead gun runner.
the only connection? Agent Vann.
Yeah, well, l-l... I don't believe that.
why not? 'Cause he's such a nice guy?
why do you think he never called for backup?
he didn't want cops around.
I don't know anything. L... l...
that's bullshit! - I don't know anything!
that's bullshit! You're up to your neck in it, pal.
what do you want from me? - You're gonna wear a wire and get Vann to admit he was in on the heist and he killed his partner.
Oh, is that all? - You don't have a choice.
Really? What if I just say "No, thank you"?
then the U. S. Department of Justice will take a giant shit on you.
H... how very pleasant.
believe me, Mr. Fiddler, your best option is to go along with this S. W.C. that's "Suspect...
suspect Who's Cooperating." I know, I've been that.
it, uh, didn't work out too well.
uh, let me get this straight.
you sprung him from holding, gave him half a million dollars, then you let him go?
the guy's a salesman from out of town.
Oh, really? You think it was a coincidence that he showed up at exactly the right place at exactly the right time in the diner?
I don't believe in coincidence. For all you know, - he could be an undercover I. A. Agent. - Did you ever check him for a wire?
I didn't have to. The guy was scared shitless half the time.
I can't believe that you of all people bought his story,
Mr. L-Don't-Trust-Nobody.
how'd you get so stupid so fast?
now they got you tied to the heist, your partner's murder and your snitch.
booty's dead.
remember, this guy is a stone killer, if he senses anything wrong, he'll toe-tag your ass.
I just need to get a sound check.
you want me to say something? - Good, I got it.
good, I got it. - I got it.
I got it. - Hey. Hey, I said I got it.
I don't think I can do this.
just do this one thing for us and you're done.
okay, you know what? You guys have got to stop saying that.
the guy helped me set up a buy that's gonna go down any time now.
what I need from you is an assault unit to back me up.
forget it. I want your badge and your gun. You're on suspension.
bullshit.
your badge and your gun now!
you're serious? - I'm trying to protect you.
we got a dead agent on our hands and I can't account for one damn thing you've done for the past 24 hours, except lose a lot of money and make best friends with the I. A. Agent who's gonna bust your ass.
and that look does not scare me.
I am one inch away.
an inch too far, okay? Gun and badge.
you're wrong. The guy's at a convention right now, giving a speech.
Really? Then who's that standing behind you?
guess who?
what the hell are you doing here? - I knew you were gonna ask.
I, uh, just finished my speech, and I had a little time before my flight and thought I would just stop by and see how you're doing.
chit-chat?
is... is there some place we can talk?
yeah? - Avenue A, warehouse three, right now.
don't forget the money.
why don't we, um, talk in my car? Come on.
in the car? We're going to the car.
over.
mission one, vehicle leaving Michigan and First.
okay, I read you, Air Support.
stay above audible range but don't lose them.
uh, copy that.
so, where are we headed?
do you want to get a smoothie? - We're going to see our old friends.
Oh. Well, I've got a 5: 00 flight, so l... I don't know whether I'll have time to...
Hey, you wanted to chit-chat? - Yes, I do.
so, let's chit-chat. - Okay, good.
so, how you doing? - Good.
you wired?
Yes. Yes, I am wired.
I'm, uh, you know, white-knuckle flier, l... I get pre-flight anxiety.
so, I get... I get very anxious before a flight.
I didn't think it showed.
so, I guess you got your money. - No, I didn't.
did you call for backup?
do I ever called for backup?
no.
you think I'm dirty.
you tell me. - I ain't telling you shit, - you I. A. Piece of crap. - What?!
thought you had me played, didn't you? Feeding me all that bullshit - this whole time. - I've been feeding you bullshit?
that's right. Bullshit!
Oh, now, you wait just one minute, mister!
you shot me, you dragged me all over town, you used me to set up your dirty deals.
Hey, I've got news for you, homie,
I'm not your bitch anymore!
now, I want the truth and I want it now.
I think you're involved and I think you killed Booty.
Aw, shit! He just blew it.
I killed Booty? - I said, "I think you killed Booty.
how the hell did you even know Booty was dead?
exactly, how would I know? I would not know. I wouldn't know, so I could not be more wrong on that point.
let's do this, gentlemen.
Mmm. - Inside.
the target is stopped, the deal's going down now.
they told me to get a confession from you.
I know.
shall we?
down!
shots fired, repeat, shots fired!
get me an assault team!
get out. - We're gonna die. We're gonna die.
hey hey! Just calm down.
we are not going to die. - Oh!
trust me. - Trust you.
there are the guns, where's my money?
let me ask you something.
did he say I was his bitch or his dumb bitch?
you think I'm just gonna roll in here with a truckload of cash so you can take it from me and kill me? I look that stupid?
well, just in case you are, I'll speak real slow.
if you don't have two and a half million dollars in your car, you're both gonna die. Right now.
I don't think so. - Yeah, why's that?
cause we brought company.
you son of a bitch.
you're under arrest. - That's a cue.
what's my assault team's ETA? I need 'em here now.
so, tell me... which one of you Spice Girls - blew my partner away? - That would be me.
so, I guess that makes you Scary Spice.
yeah? - Yeah.
gentlemen, let's not lose our heads here.
cause we all have people we want to see again.
I have a family.
and you have a daughter, I'm sure you have someone.
I have no one. - Well, let me finish.
you have someone not in the traditional sense of having someone...
well, fucking now I have you.
I have got to learn to stop talking.
now back off! - Or what?
do I really need to say it? - You shoot him; I shoot you.
better yet, this gun can put a hole through both of you.
you won't do that. - Wanna bet?
you won't shoot your friend.
Ah, yes, he would and he did, - but I hope he won't. - Shut up.
Nigel, take his gun.
now, you give your gun to Nigel and you get on your knees slowly.
let it go.
you're alone, Agent Vann.
it might appear that way, but my man Masseter's got my back.
who? - Mr. Masseter.
latin dude. 600 pounds of power.
nice try.
see, now I'm gonna count to three, and if you don't give your gun to Nigel and get on your knees,
I'm gonna put a bullet between your eyes.
Ah! Oh!
move in now, go! Go! Go!
Oh!
Ah! Oh! Oh!
SWAT team! Don't move! - Shit!
go! Go! Go!
are you alive? Oh! Are you hit?
Yeah. - Where?
in my ass.
in your ass? Let me take a look.
Oh, shit! Get off me!
I'll get the taco sauce.
all right. Easy. - On your face! Get down! Now!
all right, let's go! - Watch your right! Watch your right!
can I assume that Agent Vann has been cleared by Internal Affairs now?
no, not so fast. I want to see every penny of that money.
heads up.
how about now, you bean-counting moron?
look, I appreciate the ride, I really do, but I think I can get on a plane by myself.
Yeah, I'm sure you can, but I just want to see it with my own eyes.
the white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
there is no parking.
tell me I didn't hear what I think I just heard.
it's really nothing, l... uh, I wouldn't worry about it.
it's nothing. - Did you eat lunch - when you went back to the hotel? - I had some lunch.
what did you have for lunch exactly?
I had a sandwich. - What kind of sandwich?
steak sandwich.
shit! You rotten-ass son of a bitch!
Oh my. - Sisters.
Oh... woo! Woo!
Oh, sweet Jesus!
this is the boarding call...
right through, please, sir.
you're fine. Sir, right through.
uh...
um, sir, could you come with me, please?
on the mat, please.
arms straight out. That's it, thank you.
huh.
uh...
is there something in your butt, sir?
Yeah. A bullet.
it's permanently lodged in my ass that I received in the line of duty, - saving his ass. - I can vouch for that.
I'm gonna have to ask you to step behind the screen, please, sir.
I'm gonna need to get a cavity search team, please.
Oh, hell, no! That ain't happening!
no no no no no no. - Sir, uh, you cannot step - past this point... - Don't worry.
I am never going past this point.
see what you done? I can't even leave town now.
sorry.
well, I guess I should get going.
you say goodbye to your beautiful little ballerina for me.
Mmm. Tell yours I said hello too.
Oh.
well... - Whoa whoa, hey hey!
let's not and say we did. - Okie-doke.
told you I never met anyone I wasn't friends with eventually.
Bye, Vann.
Andy.
cavity search team? - Yes, sir.
where the hell you guys been?
guy's getting away.
grey plaid suit, brown bag.
Hurry!
sir! Excuse me, sir!
sir! Excuse me, sir!
yeah yeah, we, uh, need to perform a cavity search, please.
what? What? - Yeah, just this way.
who's my bitch?
uh, it'll just take a few minutes. - I have done nothing wrong!
what do we got?
Jim Gulbrand, C.E.O. and founder of the software company Gaia Matrix, was reported missing by his live-in brother yesterday.
local P.D. responded to the call, but they didn't check the boat until this morning.
they found blood on the deck, but no sign of a body.
why is it ours?
the marina is privately owned, on lease by the city of Sausalito.
it was local P.D.'s decision whether or not to take the case.
mm, a high-profile missing persons case.
I wonder why they wouldn't take that.
you coming? - He's not feeling well. Stomach.
I'm fine.
you get me sick, I'm gonna put you on stakeout for a month.
Yes, boss.
this is it? - Yeah.
no sign of struggle, no weapon?
nothing.
what else do we know about the victim?
Jim Gulbrand is 33 years old.
he lives here in Sausalito, has an estimated net worth of $100 million.
he's rich. Very rich.
he's also recently divorced from one Kathryn Stubbs Gulbrand.
does the victim have a criminal record?
no. The company he founded, Gaia Matrix, was under investigation by the S.E.C. for securities violations.
he was facing heavy fines and federal prison time.
do you need my help with... Never mind.
maybe it's all just an elaborate hoax.
that would explain why there's no body.
you take a boat out, you go missing, everybody assumes you're at the bottom of the ocean.
your body and your killer are never to be found.
that'd make perfect sense.
this one? No. - Nope.
how about this one?
Ah, sorry.
what are you doing?
well, there's no use in being anchored when you're tied up at the dock.
after you.
when did you notice your brother was missing?
well, Jim and I talked every day.
I knew something was wrong when he didn't come home.
so you live here with your brother, Keith?
uh, for a few months, semi-temporarily.
Jim wanted company during his divorce.
after you, bro.
tell us about your brother-- who he associated he with, what drove him.
well, Jim's life was Gaia Matrix. Yeah.
that's the company he started with rick. Green, um...
platform... Software. Don't ask me what that is.
Rick being Rick Bregman?
Rick and Jim were best friends from grade school, and they built a whole empire out of our parents' garage.
at the uh...
at the time I was totally bummed, you know, 'cause I'm like, "dude, where do I set up my drum kit now?
well, little did I know.
what about his personal life? Was he dating anyone?
Brooke harper-- cool woman...
for a psychiatrist.
Oh, she's a psychiatrist. - Yeah.
uh, works at the Sausalito rehab center.
I was in there for, um, refresher course, and that's how they first met, when, um, Jim came to visit.
did your brother and Brooke have any arguments lately? Anything like that?
no. Jim's crazy about her.
he said, uh, she's the only woman that could figure him out.
I think he was gonna propose to her.
your brother was recently divorced, right?
from a, uh, Kathryn Stubbs Gulbrand?
best thing he ever did.
that woman was a... nightmare.
how so?
she was just a giant greed head.
I mean, all she wanted was a bigger house, bigger boat, more jewelry...
do you, uh, play all these instruments?
uh, keyboards and bass mostly.
is it a sort of a new-age rock fusion?
Yeah. Kinda... Yeah. You know, with an edge?
how did you know, man?
Ah, wild guess.
you make much money doing this, playing the keyboards?
no. No. But I'm not in it for the money. You know, music's a...
it's a spiritual thing.
Yeah, it is. So is money.
everything that exists has a spiritual essence or not at all.
so what happens to all this? Who gets it?
a portion of the estate will go to the charities that jim supported,
and the rest will go to me.
Ah, moti.
chill, man.
Oh, I'm just playing.
where were you Friday night?
I...
was in bed with a lady friend...
Gretchen somethin', um...
number?
thank you.
what do you reckon? - Possible.
you? - I don't know.
Cho, write down this number. - Got it.
Gretchen, no last name.
it's the brother's alibi for last Friday night.
have van pelt check it out.
you and Rigsby go and talk to Gulbrand's partner, Rick Bregman.
he should be at Gaia Matrix. - All right. Will do, boss.
what?
never mind.
I'm agent Cho. This is agent Van Pelt, CBI.
I'm Stuart Hanson. I'll take you to rick. - Right.
what's your job here, Mr. Hanson?
Jim hates labels and pigeonholes.
I'm kind of the security chief, but that sounds so fascistic, doesn't it?
what I am really is the firewalls and encryptions and off-the-wall ideas guy.
Rick's been in the conference room all morning, dealing with the fallout from Jim's death.
he's pretty broken. We all are.
Jim meant so much to this company, to all of us.
the company is co-owned by you and Jim, is that right?
Yes.
how did that relationship work, exactly?
Jim was the creative brain behind Gaia Matrix.
he was the visionary.
I handled the business side.
we made a good team. You know, he was a genius, but he wasn't...
aggressive.
me, I'm a jock... competitive. I like to win, make no apologies for it.
is that what got you into trouble with the S.E.C?
um, my lawyers warned me that this line of questioning might come up,
and this is all I'm prepared to say on that subject at the moment
I am currently under investigation by the S.E.C. for securities violations due to my role here at Gaia Matrix.
that doesn't sound like you said anything.
you understand why i can't comment any further.
did the investigation cause any animosity between you and Jim?
no. Not at all. We were like brothers.
where were you the night of his murder?
home... Alone. Look, you're not getting this.
Jim was the creative genius behind Gaia Matrix.
without him, this company is in grave jeopardy.
I had nothing to gain and everything to lose by his death.
Dr. Harper, how long have you been dating Jim Gulbrand?
it was just after I transferred here from Boston, so seven months ago now.
his...
an acquaintance of his was staying here uh, we hit it off right away.
could you think of anyone who, uh...
excuse me-- might want him dead?
I've thought about that a lot this morning, and...
I can't think of anyone.
Jim was a kind, gentle, generous, brilliant man.
I can't imagine anyone being capable of doing something so awful to him.
Really? You're a psychiatrist, and you can't imagine that?
to be more precise, i can't imagine a rational reason for wishing him dead.
it's, uh, standard procedure to ask-- um, where you on the night of the murder?
I was here, finishing up some work.
if you'd like, I could have the admin nurse send over the paperwork documenting my hours.
Yeah, that would be helpful. Thank you.
do you have any... leads on the investigation so far?
Oh, I'm sorry. We don't discuss our process, Ma'am.
uh, when exactly did you learn of your boyfriend's murder?
if you want to know why I'm at work the same day that my boyfriend is found dead,
why don't you just ask me?
okay. Uh, why are you at work the same day your boyfriend is found dead?
I have patients who need me.
and if I had to sit at home and actually think about Jim being... gone...
I'd lose it.
being here, whether it... Looks good to you or not, is the only way I know how to cope.
are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay. - Uh, no. He's-- he's been quite sick.
well, let me have a look at you. - I'm fine.
fever.
nausea? Coughing? - Oh, yeah.
flu.
look, I'm not really supposed to do this, but if you want,
I can write a prescription for an antiviral.
uh, sure.
have this filled and...
you will feel better in no time.
uh, sure. Thanks.
thank you.
any word from Gulbrand's partner?
not much in the way of motive, but he doesn't have an alibi for the night of the murder.
Gulbrand's brother, on the other hand, checked out.
a Gretchen Moore says he was with her the night of the murder.
roommate backs up the story.
are you still sick? Man, go see a doctor.
I did. The dead guy's girlfriend wrote me a prescription.
so go fill it. - Nah. By the time I take it, I'll be better.
What'd she give you anyway?
oseltamivir phosphate.
may I see that?
anything about this strike you as odd?
what's odd about it? "oseltamivir phosphate.
exactly. You can read it.
when was the last time you saw a doctor's handwriting that you could read?
so she's precise. Is that what you're implying?
Yes, and the possibility that Dr. Brooke Harper is not a doctor.
because she has penmanship skills?
and she doesn't have that cold, creepy, doctor-y vibe they all have.
well, be fair. Not all doctors are cold and creepy.
first day of medical school, they get a stack of books and a dead human being--that,
I'm afraid, will change you, Brooke Harper was warm and emotional.
you like her, so she can't be a doctor.
pretty much.
the A.M.A. and Boston general both have records of a doctor named Brooke Harper.
see?
but it says here that she's 64 years old.
she looks pretty good.
is there a word for uncanny and irritating?
Jeff, I'm going to be leaving the clinic shortly,
so this is going to be our last session together.
Oh, no, no, no. I-I-I need you, Dr. Harper.
how will I manage without you?
I'm sorry, Jeff. I have enjoyed our sessions together, but I'm sure the clinic will provide you with the best care possible.
should you ever need to speak with me personally...
I'm very sorry to interrupt, Dr. Harper, but the CBI are here again, and they need to speak with you.
all right. Well, tell them I'll be with them in ten minutes.
they said they need to speak with you right now, this moment, and they are most insistent.
tell them I'll be right out, Maggie. Thank you.
I mean, I just...
I feel like I'm on the verge of a real breakthrough. I...
I'm starting to open myself up again to people in a real way.
my inner child is finally emerging.
d-- Dr. Harper? Dr. Harper?
damn. Let's go.
all I was able to find at Dr. Brooke Harper's apartment.
bank account emptied, credit cards maxed out.
she must have been packed and ready to leave days ago.
her social security number and medical license are fakes, too.
we have no idea who this woman is.
well, we know that she's smart.
she posed as a doctor for seven months, managed to elude you and Rigsby.
no, she had a head start. She didn't elude us.
all right, she eluded us.
well, she's a professional conwoman.
I mean, she probably specializes in the seduction of rich and successful, socially awkward men.
you think she's done this before?
Oh, yes, many times.
why kill Jim Gulbrand? What's her motive?
maybe he found out the truth about her.
then why not just vanish?
good morning. - Morning.
I've been going through Gulbrand's financial records and found something interesting.
last year, Gulbrand made a series of cash withdrawals from various accounts, totaling $10 million.
What'd he spend the money on?
that's just it. He didn't deposit it, and it doesn't look like he spent it.
so either he paid somebody off or he hid the money
a cash nest egg-- either from his ex-wife or the S.E.C.
maybe that's what Brooke Harper was after.
if only we knew who she was or where she was.
well, we know that she's OL, she's fearless, she's systematic.
I mean, she went back to the clinic for an extra day to try and hook another sucker.
she's a planner.
could we get a copy of her last credit card statement?
I can get it.
and they had the nerve to send me a gold Mercedes instead of a black one,
and so I sent it back.
Kathryn Stubbs Gulbrand, and you're interrupting.
ma'am, we have a few questions regarding your ex-husband's death.
Really? You want to talk to me now?
or we can talk to you at the station, if you prefer.
fine. - Thank you. Thank you, ladies.
how long had you and Jim Gulbrand been divorced?
14 months-- that's when I moved out.
the divorce was final a year ago.
were you angry about the divorce?
of course I was angry. That's usually why people get divorced.
court documents indicate that you sued your ex-husband on multiple occasions.
you bet your ass I did.
Jim tried to claim that the money that he had in Gaia Matrix stock wasn't actually his,
but part of the company's capital.
I disagreed, and I won.
I got everything I wanted and more.
we have reason to believe that your ex-husband may have hidden money from you - during the divorce proceedings. - What?
he made $10 million in cash withdrawals last year.
you weren't aware of that?
that son of a bitch. I knew it. I knew he was holding out.
that wasn't a damn gym locker key, was it?
what key?
last year he started wearing this key around his neck, under his shirt.
I asked him what it was, and he said that it was his gym locker key.
but I knew it wasn't. I knew it.
how perceptive. - What was that?
Oh, nothing, ma'am.
so you didn't know anything about the money?
if I did, it would've been mine right now.
where is it? - We don't know.
well, half that money's legally mine.
I don't want Jim's loser brother getting his loser hands on it.
I'm sure your probate judge will take care of it.
last Friday, the, uh, night of your ex-husband's murder, where were you from 7: 00 through 10: 00 p. m?
I was at a wine tasting in Napa.
could anyone confirm that for us?
can you people charge me with any crime?
uh, no, but-- - uh, no, you can't.
when you can, maybe then I'll tell you the details of my personal life.
until then, mind your own business.
I just got off the phone with our liaison at the S.E.C. turns out Jim Gulbrand Was cooperating with their investigation.
Rick Bregman never mentioned it.
make sure you mention it to him.
what's this?
Brooke harper only used a credit card twice in the last two week this is what she bought
in one day of shopping nine days ago, and this is what she bought yesterday.
now what do these things tell us? That's a wig, by the way.
what's that on the, uh, bottom right?
bandage.
it doesn't look like a bandage.
it's a bandage.
what do these things tell you?
Brooke harper wanted to pose as a man?
right. - But why?
and what's that other stuff?
well, that's--that's the puzzle.
is that Kathryn Stubbs?
she's... She's an unhappy person.
Where's Rigsby?
he went to get his prescription filled.
I think that Kathryn woman actually made him worse.
she's hiding something, too.
she wouldn't say who she was with the night of the murder.
keep an eye on her. - Interesting.
she did tell us that Gulbrand wore a key around his neck, that he said it was for his gym locker.
only there wasn't a key found on the body, as there? - No.
she took his key.
that's why she dressed as a man, so that she could get into his locker in the men's changing room of the gym.
but if she had found Jim's millions, then she would have simply vanished right then and there.
why stick around?
because the money wasn't in the locker.
exactly.
she's now trying to get inside somewhere else.
thank you. - Good afternoon. May I help you?
Yeah. I'm Jim Gulbrand. I'm a member here.
uh, sir?
I-I know Mr. Gulbrand well, and you are not he.
what are you doing?
I'm just confirming that Jim Gulbrand's a member here.
why not just ask?
go ahead. Ask him.
is Jim Gulbrand a member here?
I'm sorry, sir. We don't divulge membership details.
see?
this is a murder investigation. Mr. Gulbrand is dead.
well, I'm very sorry to hear that.
well, thanks for your help.
Oh, sir. Sir, this-- this is a private club.
what I'm learning-- which is good for our theory
is one can't just wander in here and hang out.
one needs a plan.
we're gonna have to take a look around.
that's not our policy, sir.
if we have to obtain with a warrant, we're gonna come back here and take every computer and every piece of paper in this building, and then we're gonna have a sit-down chat with each one of your members.
welcome to the backgammon club. - Thank you.
I don't get it. What is she doing?
I don't know. Maybe she likes the water.
aryou feeling better?
eah, much. It's weird.
I know Brooke Harper's not a real doctor, but whatever she gave me really worked.
good. I was getting worried about you.
I've been thinking that maybe-- - Here we go.
the best friend and business partner.
a lover of the ex-wife.
apparently.
double? - No. You win.
outrageous luck you have, no?
you are a monster.
what is it now? - What is it?
I must have my revenge.
Jane. - What?
you want me to spell it out?
we're just having fun, right? - Absolutely.
the first prince I've ever met.
how sweet. - Thank you.
there she blows.
uh, prince, uh, can I be excused from this game?
my date just arrived. - Of course.
maybe that's lucky for me, eh? - Probably.
$20, 000?
enjoy.
Hey, listen. Just, uh, just forget about that, okay?
certainly not.
you won fair and square.
well, actually, I cheated. Uh, I controlled the dice.
it's in the wrist, just in the wrist.
please don't be offended. I-I would have taken your money and given it to a worthy cause,
but my friend here is a moralist of childish simplicity.
nice to meet you.
Hello, gorgeous. - Beat it, creep.
I'd call you by your real name, but I don't know what it is.
Hello, Mr. Jane.
I'm impressed. Well done.
Oh, for finding you?
it wasn't that difficult.
would you have a cigar?
Ah, thank you, no.
I hear they're not so good for your health.
well, who wants to live forever?
it'd be horrible, wouldn't it?
immortality? Imagine the boredom.
my friend Cho here will now take you by the wrists so as not to let you escape us again.
warm hands.
Ah, I bet you say that to all your arresting officers.
who are you, Brooke?
how did you find me?
well, let's make a deal.
I'll tell you how we found you if you tell us who you are.
okay.
my name is Angela Dalibar, and I'm from Birmingham, England, by way of Hong Kong.
how did you find me?
I planted a g. p.s. tracking device on you.
outstanding technology.
no bigger than a stick of gum.
can you tell us more about yourself, Angela?
how long have you been a professional conwoman?
all my life, I suppose.
and I confess, my name's not really Angela.
and I didn't plant a G.P.S. tracking device on you.
how then?
well, maybe you're not as enigmatic and elusive as you think you are.
I wouldn't be so sure of that. - No?
you manipulate people because you take pleasure in it.
you enjoy being the smartest person in the room.
you're interested in money, of course, but only so far as it allows you to continue conning people.
you allow yourself one indulgence-- not men, obviously.
not drinking or drugs, because you fear that they will impair your abilities.
you move around too much to have a pet.
so my guess...
chocolate.
you're good.
so why do you do this, Brooke?
neglected as a child?
is this your way of getting attention?
or is it something a little darker?
just a genuine mystery, I suppose.
well, we have your prints now, so we'll know who you are soon enough.
do you think one can ever truly know another person?
I doubt it.
how do you come to have Jim Gulbrand's key in your possession?
he gave it to me. - Didn't tell you what it would unlock?
it wasn't given as a real key. It was a symbol... of our love.
it's the key to his heart.
you said "our love" with conviction.
are you trying to tell us that you loved him, too?
Yes, to my great surprise.
I did come to love him, in a way.
he was a good, kind man. - So sweet.
Yes, it is.
Yes, this is also the key to a locker that holds $10 million.
Really? I thought it was for cigars.
I love a good cigar. - Nope. $10 million.
but that's just silly.
why would Jim keep $10 million in a locker?
she's good. - Yeah, she is.
what are you doing here?
duh, looking for the money.
Rick figured maybe there were secret compartments on the boat or something.
how long have you been seeing Rick Bregman romantically?
about a year.
you were divorced from Jim Gulbrand about a year ago.
were you and rick involved while you were still married to Jim?
involved?
were you having sexual intercourse with him?
no. Rick would never do that to Jim.
but you would.
I ha needs just like anybody else.
I refuse to be ashamed of my needs.
then why did you lie to us about your relationship?
because I knew how it would look.
you knew it'd make you look guilty of Jim's murder?
no. Yes. It's just...
it wasn't just that.
gaia matrix's stock has been falling for months.
this market has hurt even the best of companies.
the last thing I need is some "page six" sex scandal to make things worse.
so you misled us in order to protect your money.
I misled you to protect the company that Jim and I built from the ground up.
were you aware that Jim Gulbrand was cooperating with S.E.C. investigators?
Jim would never go behind my back like that.
well, he would, and he did.
the question is, if you found out, what would you do to stop him?
this conversation is over.
when did you find out about the $10 million he was hiding?
over.
$10 million? That's a lot of money.
Oh, yeah.
Jim trusted you with the security of his company.
he valued your, uh, outside-the-box thinking.
you advised him on what to do with the money, didn't you?
didn't you?
we don't care if hiding the money was legal or unethical.
our focus is the homicide investigation.
I-it's not that. It's just...
I absolutely promised Jim I wouldn't say anything.
we found out Jim's girlfriend, Brooke Harper, is a conwoman.
we think she was after the money and might have murdered Jim to get it.
we found her, along with this key, trying to open Gulbrand's cabinet at the backgammon club.
the key didn't work.
evidently, she took it from Jim, but she doesn't know where the money is.
that's some lady. - Oh, yeah.
if you help us find the money, we can prove that Brooke was looking for it,
and establish a motive for murder.
so, Stuart, do you know where the money is?
no. Well, n-not exactly, anyway.
Jim did come to me for some out-of-the-box security advice.
like you said, he wanted to hide the money from his ex-wife.
I told him that safety deposit boxes and offshore accounts could be traced rather easily,
so they wouldn't be of any use.
so where'd you tell him to hide it?
off the grid.
out of the financial institutions, any place a trail couldn't be established.
like a home safe? - No.
anything on his property is subject to search.
no, it had to be secure-- obviously, hence the key
but more importantly, it had to be a place that no one would think to look.
hidden in plain sight. - Yes.
but that's the extent of my involvement.
I have no idea where he actually hid the money.
Oh, yeah. I see.
Oopsy. Yeah.
don't want to go losing that, now do we?
what do you make of it?
you think he knows where Jim hid the money?
I think he knows the general whereabouts of the money, but he doesn't know exactly.
and the devil is in the details, isn't he?
here's what happened. - I'm all ears.
two weeks ago, you took the locker key from around Jim's neck when he was sleeping
and replaced it with an identical one so Jim was none the wiser.
then when you tried to open the locker at the gym, the key didn't fit.
so the money was hidden somewhere else, but where?
last Friday, you got impatient, and you pushed Jim to tell you where he'd hidden the money.
Jim wouldn't tell you. You got mad, and you killed him.
no.
you probably didn't do it on purpose, did you?
it was an accident. - It wasn't.
I didn't do it.
sad thing is, with all your skills, the answer was right there in front of you.
you just didn't see it.
you didn't do enough research.
you're playing me. You don't know either.
Jim's security systems are all designed by the same man at Gaia Matrix.
Stuart Hanson. - Him.
he suggested where to put the money.
you could have squeezed the truth out of him very swiftly, I imagine, Putty to a woman like you-- but instead, you had to kill a man.
I wouldn't do that. You don't know me.
Lindsey Smith from San Diego.
father Ryan, salesman...
mother Debbie, homemaker...
two miss teen Temecula county titles.
varsity softball...
church choir soloist.
then you disappeared off the records for a couple years, and when you came back,
you were a con artist with two fraud convictions.
what happened?
nothing happened.
I like money, and I'm easily bored.
there's gotta be more to it than that.
it's a cold, hard, lonely life you lead.
what is it that drives you?
passion for excellence.
okay.
relax a while.
uh, an agent will be in here to run you through the formal charges against you.
run away. Good luck, Lindsey.
and to you.
any luck with harper?
there's no luck involved.
the outcome's a given. - Is that so?
Yeah, it's all applied psychology and Newtonian physics.
excuse me. Ma'am? Can I see some I.D. please?
you call that a uniform shirt? It's filthy.
well, I tried to clean-- - filthy.
no excuses, Stiles.
I will address this matter with your captain at my earliest convenience.
is she on the move yet?
she made one stop and hasn't left her motel room since.
What'd she stop for? - Chocolate.
Oh, and, uh, thank you.
for what?
for just letting this play out like this.
eh, we would have had to let her go on the murder charge anyway.
nothing to keep her on until we get some hard proof.
and besides, this is a simple plan.
it's when you start getting costumes and props that i get nervous.
trick plays like this?
my dad calls them chewing gum plays.
sometimes you fool the other guy, and sometimes you just get gum in your hair.
she's moving.
train station. It had to be a train station.
what's wrong with the train station?
people, noise, tunnels, trains, more people.
her vehicle's stopped outside the station.
hold your positions until i give you the word.
Yes, boss. Standing by.
copy that.
all set.
chewing gum plays.
I can already see my hair with a big chunk out of it.
you'd look good with short hair.
choppy, a little-- kind of peter pan--good for the eyes.
okay, heads-up.
she's in motion, approaching the station now.
Cho, do you have a visual?
affirmative. She's exiting the vehicle now.
she has Stuart Hanson with her.
she has a gun. Be advised-- Brooke Harper is armed.
Rigsby, van pelt, what's your status?
I have Harper and Hanson in sight.
van pelt, she's moving your way.
got 'em. Looks like she's headed to the commuter lockers. I'm on it.
it's the gate. I'm stuck.
all right, don't move.
don't do anything and don't say anything.
this better be the right place.
she opened the locker. I think she has the money.
okay, I-- - uh, wait. Just - just wait a moment.
Oh, my.
don't move or I'll kill you.
don't move!
Hanson. - I got him. Excuse me.
gun.
you're under arrest... again.
let's go.
Jason Bradshaw, Jason Wade, Anthony Wade, Anthony Samuels, the list goes on All aliases you've used in scams ranging from identity theft to Ponzi Schemes.
you're quite the virtuoso. - Thank you.
but this one-- this would have been your most daring and successful crime yet.
$10 million of Jim Gulbrand's money.
Gulbrand was the perfect mark-- rich, liquid and unconventional.
I bet he didn't even check your references when he hired you.
nothing says trustworthy like a wheelchair.
you convinced Gulbrand that the train station was a genius place to hide his money.
screw orthodox wisdom.
think sideways, right? Right?
and he ate it up.
he ate it up.
why wouldn't he? Then you simply needed to get the key.
you went to the yacht that night because you knew he'd be alone.
you also knew he kept the key with him.
you did what needed to be done.
you killed Jim Gulbrand.
then you got rid of the body.
but you didn't count on Brooke Harper.
you couldn't have known she swapped the real key...
with a look-alike.
you didn't realize anything was wrong until you tried to open the locker.
it wasn't until we came to Gaia Matrix with the real key...
that it dawned on you what she'd done.
I can only imagine your surprise.
six months living in that chair.
six months, and no one ever questioned me about it.
why did you?
whenever I meet someone in a wheelchair, I check the bottoms of their shoes.
the bottoms of your shoes...
were scuffed.
I've been checking shoes for years. This is the first time it's ever paid off.
first time.
that's gratifying, man. Very, very gratifying.
Oh, he's a pistol, isn't he?
sorry about the cuffs.
my own fault. - Oh, yeah.
well, I could let you go again, but you know...
I understand.
that urge you have to get one over on people, the need to be smarter than the next guy...
it'll keep biting you on the ass.
so my butt'll hurt occasionally.
I'll still be smarter than the next guy.
no, Jessica Waters. Th-that's Harper right there.
uh, agent? This is harper.
worth a try. - Of course.
Brooke Harper, I'm agent Fred Hayes.
I'll be in charge of transporting you to the federal detention center in Davis.
let's go.
see you around, Patrick.
I doubt you'll be seeing much of anybody for a few years.
Oh, I don't know about that, agent Hayes.
she's very good at what she does.
Yeah.
excuse ME.
what KIND OF TREE IS THIS?
couldn't SAY.
smells GOOD.
so YOU'RE NOT A LOCAL?
born 5 MILES DOWN THE ROAD.
just DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT TREES.
thank YOU.
name's JUSTIN PRENTISS.
student AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL OPERATION
a COUPLE MILES FROM HERE.
they REALIZED HE WAS MISSING AROUND 6: 00 THIS MORNING,
activated THE ELECTRONIC MONITORING DEVICE ON HIS ANKLE,
found HIM AND CALLED US AT 8: 00.
do THEY HAVE AN ESTIMATED TIME OF DEATH YET?
coroner PUTS TIME OF DEATH SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 10: 00 AND 1: 00 LAST NIGHT.
I WANTED TO TAKE HIM DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SOON AS FORENSICS WERE DONE, BUT AS PER YOUR REQUEST, WE DIDN'T TOUCH HIM.
Oh, WE WON'T BE HERE LONG. YOU CAN HAVE HIM AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE.
good QUESTION. MR. MACLEAN?
this IS THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL--ASHER MACLEAN.
these PEOPLE ARE FROM THE CBI.
they WANT TO KNOW WHY YOUR STUDENT HAS AN ELECTRONIC MONITORING DEVICE ON HIM.
Justin HAD SOME TRUANCY ISSUES RECENTLY, HENCE THE DEVICE.
what KIND OF SCHOOL IS THIS, EXACTLY?
like A SUMMER CAMP? NO, WE'RE AN ACCREDITED HIGH SCHOOL.
students STAY AT BRIGHT ARCH FOR A YEAR, ON AVERAGE.
we PROVIDE STRUCTURE AND DISCIPLINE THROUGH CLOSE INTERACTION WITH NATURE PLUS A REGULAR HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM, OF COURSE.
she DOESN'T LIKE YOU, AND YOU DON'T LIKE HER.
why IS THAT?
no COMMENT.
chief BRODY?
why DON'T YOU LIKE HIM? WHAT HAS THAT GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING?
I'm JUST CURIOUS. THINK YOU MIGHT SHOW A LITTLE MORE RESPECT.
respect FOR... THERE IS A DEAD CHILD HERE.
Yes. YES, HE'S DEAD.
he DOESN'T CARE HOW I TALK TO YOU.
I've NEVER WORKED WITH THE CBI BEFORE.
do ALL YOUR UNITS COME WITH A CLOWN? WE GET THE JOB DONE.
well, HOW ABOUT GETTING IT DONE NOW?
so WE CAN TAKE THIS KID OUT OF HERE. HOW WOULD THAT BE?
Yeah. WE'LL DO THAT.
Yep, YOU CAN TAKE HIM. WE'VE GOT THE BASIC FACTS.
Oh, IS THAT RIGHT? THAT QUICK, HUH? UH, YEAH.
you WANT TO ENLIGHTEN US?
forensics PROBABLY TOLD YOU A LOT OF IT ALREADY, I WOULD GUESS.
uh, HIS KNUCKLES AND HIS KNEES SUEST THAT HE WAS OVERPOWERED IN A HAND-TO-HAND STRUGGLE.
but THE GROUND AROUND HIM IS RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED, WHICH MEANS THAT THE STRUGGLE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE ELSEWHERE--UPHILL, PRESUMABLY.
injured ANIMALS TEND TO MOVE DOWNHILL, OF COURSE.
do YOU HAVE ANY ACTUAL FACTS?
well, IT'S AN ACTUAL FACT THAT YOU DISLIKE MR. MACLEAN HERE
because HE'S A TREE-HUGGING, LIBERAL WACKO.
he's PROBABLY RUNNING SOME KIND OF A CULT, AND HE DISLIKES YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE A SMALL-MINDED, PROVINCIAL HAYSEED
not THAT YOU ARE, NECESSARILY. THAT'S JUST WHAT HE THINKS.
facts PERTAINING TO THIS POOR BOY.
there WAS NO MOON LAST NIGHT, SO IT WAS VERY DARK.
Justin WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE VERY FAR, INJURED AS HE WAS.
he HAD A LOT OF DIRT IN HIS HAIR, A LOT OF DIRT IN HIS EARS AND DEEP UP UNDER HIS NAILS.
so SOMEWHERE CLOSE BY, SOMEWHERE VERY CLOSE BY,
there's A SPOT WHERE SOMEONE, UH... WHERE SOMEONE BURIED HIM ALIVE.
Oh, MY GOD.
all RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
settle DOWN, FOLKS.
take YOUR SEATS.
let's GO.
I KNOW THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE BEEN ROUGH.
losing JUSTIN HURTS.
but HIS DEATH CANNOT BECOME YOUR CRUTCH FOR A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE.
you CAN LEARN AND GROW FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.
sir, DO WE STILL GET TO DO THE SACRED FIRE CEREMONY ON FRIDAY?
I THINK THERE'S ALL THE MORE REASONO DO IT NOW.
we NEED HEALING. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, KIDS,
the STRANGERS YOU SEE HERE ARE DETECTIVES THAT WILL BE INVESTIGATING THE SITUATION WITH JUSTIN.
they ARE HERE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM,
and I WANT ALL OF YOU TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THEY HAVE AS BEST YOU CAN.
Yes, YES, YES, PEOPLE?
Yes, YES, YES!
is IT TRUE THAT HE WAS BURIED ALIVE?
Orrin. OH, YEAH, THAT IS TRUE.
who DID IT? THAT'S ENOUGH, ELLIOT.
let's ALL GET BACK TO OUR CLASSES QUICKLY.
we're WASTING DAYLIGHT!
you GUYS GO AND TALK TO THE COUNSELORS.
we'll PRESS THE PRINCIPAL, SEE WHAT HE KNOWS.
we'll TALK TO THE KIDS LAST. OKAY.
Mr. MACLEAN, I WANTED TO-- AGENT LISBON, EXCUSE ME. ORRIN.
we SPEAK ONLY WHEN RECOGNIZED AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION.
okay? GET OUT OF HERE.
I'm SORRY ABOUT THAT. WELL, WELCOME TO BRIGHT ARCH.
shall WE, UH, CONVENE IN MY OFFICE?
Yes, YES, YES.
honey, JUST TRY TO CALM DOWN A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?
we'll FIND EVERYTHING OUT. CALM DOWN. YOU SON OF A BITCH.
what HAPPENED? WHAT DID YOU DO? MR. PRENTISS
step BACK, SIR. NOW.
it's OKAY.
this MAN WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK AFTER MY SON.
it's HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP HIS STUDENTS SAFE,
and HE DIDN'T!
he DIDN'T! DAVID!
Mr. PRENTISS, LET'S GO AND TALK. THIS WAY.
this WAY NOW.
how DID YOU LEARN ABOUT BRIGHT ARCH?
one OF DAVID'S COLLEAGUES HAS A CHILD WHO HAD GONE WAY OFFTRACK.
and THEY SAW VERY POSITIVE RESULTS FROM THE PROGRAM.
Justin WAS MISBEHAVING?
he CHANGED A LOT OVER THE LAST YEAR.
suddenly HE WAS ALWAYS LOCKED IN HIS ROOM, DOUR, UNCOMMUNICATIVE, VIOLENT ON OCCASION.
therapy DIDN'T WORK.
what KIND OF VIOLENCE DID HE ENGAGE IN?
he OFTEN SHOUTED AT ME AND WOULD THREEN HIS FATHER.
just SHOUTING?
no PHYSICAL ABUSE, NO CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR?
no.
please FIND OUT WHO DID THIS.
please.
kids LOVE TO FEED OFF THE DRAMA OF THINGS LIKE THIS.
I HOPE IT CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY.
you KNOW, YOU LOOK LIKE BURT REYNOLDS IN THIS SHOT.
how LOOK HAS BRIGHT ARCH BEEN RUNNING?
almost TEN YEARS NOW.
and THAT WAS ALL OF THE STUDENTS?
Yes, WE LIKE TO KEEP A LOW COUNSELOR/STUDENT RATIO SO THAT EVERYONE GETS THE FOCUSED,
individual ATTENTION THAT THEY NEED.
right. WHAT'S THE PITCH?
I DON'T FOLLOW.
the PITCH-- THE GIMMICK, THE HOOK.
how DO YOU SELL THIS PLACE TO PROSPECTIVE PARENTS?
this IS A SIMPLE, NATURAL HEALING COMMUNITY WHERE YOUR...TROUBLED AND UNDERACHIEVING SONS AND DAUGHTERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THEIR INNER RESOURCES.
encouraged HOW?
by A CODE OF HONOR AND DISCIPLINE, BY LEARNING WILDERNESS SKILLS AND TEAMWORK THROUGH AN UP-CLOSE EXPERIENCE WITH MOTHER NATURE.
that's A GOOD PITCH. IT'S A GOOD PROGRAM.
Yes, CASSIE? UM, I GOT YOUR TEA.
Oh. THANK YOU.
one OF OUR, UH, OUR GREAT SUCCESS STORIES.
arrived HERE ABOUT NINE MONTHS AGO ANGRY AND WITHDRAWN.
she's BLOSSOMED WONDERFULLY. TELL ME ABOUT JUSTIN.
why WAS HE WEARING AN ELECTRONIC MONITORING DEVICE?
I LOOKED AROUND. I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE ELSE WEARING ONE. JUSTIN HAD ONLY BEEN with us 3 months HE WAS STILL IN THE REBELLIOUS PHASE.
day BEFORE YESTERDAY, HE LEFT CAMPUS WITHOUT PERMISSION FOR SEVERAL HOURS.
he REFUSED TO TELL US WHERE HE HAD BEEN AND WITH WHOM.
his PUNISHMENT WAS EIGHT HOURS IN THE REFLECTION ROOM AND THE ELECTRONIC MONITORING DEVICE FOR, UH, TWO WEEKS.
confinement AND DOG COLLARS.
Yeah, THAT'LL CERTAINLY, UH, ENCOURAGE THE DISCOVERY OF INNER RESOURCES, I GUESS.
but DO THE KIDS' PARENTS KNOW THAT'S PART OF THE DEAL? IT'S IN THE BROCHURE.
page 3
so YOU MUST GET A LOT OF PROBLEM KIDS.
how DO YOU HANDLE THE PSYCHOS
the ONES THAT JUST WON'T KNUCKLE UNDER NO MATTER WHAT?
we DON'T TAKE 'EM IN THE FIRST PLACE.
I VET THOROUGHLY EVERY ACCEPTANCE.
so NO NAME JUMPED INTO YOUR HEAD when you're HEARD ABOUT THE MURDER?
no.
you EVER HEARD OF Z KREW? NO. WHAT'S THAT?
I'd LIKE TO TALK TO JUSTIN'S FRIENDS.
of COURSE. HE WAS IN MISSY JENKINS' TEACHING POD. GREAT.
bear IN MIND THAT I OR ONE OF MY STAFF MEMBERS NEED TO BE PRESENT BEFORE YOU TALK WITH ANY OF OUR STUDENTS.
is THAT RIGHT? IT'S THE LAW.
Really?
Ohh. I HATE THE WOODS. WOULD YOU RATHER BE PLAYING DESK JOCKEY WITH VAN PELT RIGHT NOW?
who SENDS THEIR KIDS TO A PLACE LIKE THIS?
it's NOT CHEAP, EITHER.
eh, A LITTLE DEPRIVATION AND DISCIPLINE IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL.
Yeah, BUT THIS IS LIKE A JUVIE PRISON CAMP.
wait. YOU WERE IN JUVENILE HALL? SERIOUSLY?
Yeah. YOU DIDN'T READ MY FILE?
no. WHY, DID YOU READ MINE?
of COURSE.
what HAVE WE GOT?
interesting, HUH?
maybe THERE'S TREASURE INVOLVED.
maybe NOT.
follow THE TRAIL. FIND OUT.
so OVER AND UNDER...
over...
and UNDER...
and THROUGH.
simple. AGAIN.
over AND UNDER
and OVER...
and UNDER.
Chris! HIT THE REFLECTION ROOM.
one HOUR.
Marley, GIVE ME 25. BUT HE STARTED IT.
Yeah, I HEAR YOU, AND I DO NOT CARE. 25.
Hey, LADY!
are YOU TALKING TO ME? YEAH, I'M TALKING TO YOU. THIS IS IMPORTANT. LOOK AT ME.
CBI. THAT'S POLICE. THERE'LL BE NO BACKCHAT.
you DO EXACTLY AS I TELL YOU. WHAT?
hold THIS.
CBI
california BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.
well, MA'AM, WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE...
untie ME THIS INSTANT.
sorry, MA'AM. YOUR BOSS MR. MACLEAN TOLD ME TO DO THAT.
no, HE DIDN'T. YES, HE DID.
he's IN HIS OFFICE RIGHT NOW. GO AND ASK HIM.
okay, MY PEOPLE, WE HAVE PRECIOUS LITTLE TIME UNTIL OUR FRIEND RETURNS.
I NEED TO KNOW WHO KNOWS THE MOST ABOUT WHAT AROUND HERE.
Elliot's BEEN HERE, LIKE, TWO YEARS, SO HE KNOWS EVERYTHING.
wow, THAT'S A LONG TIME TO BE STUCK OUT IN THE WOODS, HUH?
I LIKE IT HERE. YEAH? SO WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH JUSTIN?
who DISLIKED HIM? NOBODY. HE WAS FINE.
Oh, YOU SAY THAT LIKE HE WAS A PRIZE JERK. NO. HE WOULDN'T WIN the prizes.
I MEAN, HE WAS BASICALLY A GOOD KID,
but HE JUST FOUGHT A LOT WITH EVERYBODY.
what DO YOU THINK HE WAS DOING OUT IN THE WOODS?
who KNOWS?
the WOODS ARE A BAD PLACE. YEAH? WHY IS THAT?
the AXMAN ZACHARIAH LIVES THERE.
who's ZACHARIAH?
there IS NO ZACHARIAH.
it's--it's JUST A STORY.
Yeah, I WAS JUST KIDDING. NO, YOU WEREN'T.
come ON, GUYS. AREN'TOU A LITTLE OLD TO BELIEVE IN STUFF LIKE THAT?
a YEAR AGO...
they FOUND A TOWNIE KID DEAD IN THE WOODS.
he'd BEEN CHOPPED UP WITH AN AX.
his HEAD WAS 20 FEET UP IN A TREE WITH A CRAZY LOOK ON HIS FACE.
okay. NOW DOES ZACHARIAH HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH Z KREW?
was JUSTIN IN Z KREW?
Jane! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU PLAYING AT?
you CAN'T TIE PEOPLE UP.
uh, YEAH. SORRY. I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD BE.
my APOLOGIES, MR. MACLEAN.
we'll BE BACK TOMORROW MORNING IF THAT'S CONVENIENT.
see YOU IN THE MORNING.
I HOPE YOU GOT SOMETHING USEFUL FOR ALL THE TROUBLE YOU CAUSED.
Yes, I DID--THE STORY OF THE MAD AXMAN ZACHARIAH
who LIVES IN THESE HERE WOODS. AH, "Z.
Yes, "Z." I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE OUT OF 'EM,
but YOU CAME BACK TOO QUICKLY.
reality CHECK-- I'M YOUR SUPERVISING AGENT. I'M NOT YOUR DECOY.
so, UH, WHAT DID IT SAY?
what?
you KNOW, MY FILE.
you HAVEN'T READ YOUR OWN FILE?
no. IT'S AGAINST THE RULES. YOU'RE KIDDING.
what? I LIKE RULES. WHY BE A COP IF YOU DON'T LIKE RULES?
come ON. WHAT DID IT SAY? YOU KNOW WHAT IT SAYS. IT'S YOUR LIFE.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE ADOPTED, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, NO SURPRISES.
adopted? WHAT?
kidding.
ha HA. VERY FUNNY.
so WHY WERE YOU IN JUVIE?
you KNOW. THE USUAL REASONS.
that HAS A MARK ON THIS MAP WITH A SKULL AND CROSSBONES.
so WHAT ARE THE USUAL REASONS FOR BEING IN JUVIE?
I'll TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT SOMETIME.
Hey, CHECK THIS OUT.
looks LIKE JUSTIN'S SHOE.
Yep.
I'll CALL FORENSICS, MARK IT UP. YEAH.
Hello? CBI!
anybody HOME?
Hello?
try THE OTHER SIDE?
Yeah.
you MOVE, YOU DIE, YOU MAMELUKE SONSOFBITCHES!
kneel DOWN! HEY, WE'RE COPS.
Kneel!
I'M-A BLOW YOUR DAMN FACES OFF YOU, YOU HEAR?
eh, EH, EH! WINSTON! COME ON!
Winston, YOU FOOL. PUT THAT GUN DOWN. LET GO.
thank YOU. NO PROBLEM.
can YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHY I'M STILL HERE?
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT KID WHO DIED. NOTHING.
you're HERE BECAUSE YOU ASSAULTED US. BUT IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUSTIN PRENTISS, THAT'S FINE.
how AM I SUPPOSED to know who you are
you're BANGIN' ON MY DOORS, "CBI! CBI!
like THAT'S SUPPOSED TO MEAN SOMETHIN'?
Yeah, WE DO NEED BETTER BRAND AWARENESS, BUT YOUR RESPONSE WAS DISPROPORTIONATE. YOU BRANDISHED A FIREARM.
so HERE WE ARE.
my SECURITY ALARM WENT OFF.
I WAS LOADED. I REACTED. THAT'S ALL.
you're VERY SECURITY-CONSCIOUS. WHY IS THAT?
why NOT? ARE THERE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DISLIKE SECURITY?
what's BEEN YOUR HISTORY OF CONTACT WITH THE STUDENTS FROM BRIGHT ARCH?
zero. I HAVE A ZERO HISTORY of contact.
you KNOW THE KID WHO WAS KILLED, JUSTIN PRENTISS, WHO WAS BURIED CLOSE TO YOUR PROPERTY LINE?
he HAD A SKETCH MAP THAT SHOWED THE WAY TO YOUR HOUSE MARKED WITH A SKULL AND CROSSBONES.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. HOW ABOUT ZACHARIAH?
that NAME RING ANY BELLS? NO.
looks LIKE IT'S GONNA BE A LONG NIGHT.
I JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE,
and I WANT THOSE KIDS TO LEAVE ME ALONE!
they GO UP TO MY PROPERTY, MESS WITH MY STUFF.
they BREAK WINDOWS. THEY SPRAY PAINT MY DOORS, ALL ALLINDS OF STUNTS ALL NIGHT,
like A ROUTINE.
okay. SO WHAT DID YOU DO IN RESPONSE?
I DID EVERYTHING TO TRY AND STOP THEM SHORT OF ACTUAL VIOLENCE.
I BUILT FENCES.
I PLANTED POISON OAK.
I INSTALLED ALARMS.
they JUST TOOK IT ALL LIKE IT WAS A GAME.
were THEY AT YOUR HOUSE LAST NIGHT? THE NIGHT BEFORE THREE OR FOUR OF 'EM, THROWING BALLOONS OF RED PAINT.
would YOU BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY OF THE KIDS INVOLVED IF YOU SAW THEM AGAIN?
they ALWAYS WORE MASKS.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE MISUNDERSTANDING YESTERDAY.
Mr. JANE WILL COMPORT HIMSELF PROPERLY TODAY. YES, I WILL.
who's ZACHARIAH?
who? ZACHARIAH.
never HEARD OF HIM. WHO IS HE? LIAR.
"LIAR"? PANTS ON FIRE.
they're ABLAZE. I WANT TO COOPERATE WITH YOU PEOPLE,
but THIS MAN IS TRYING TO-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO, BUT I RESENT IT.
you SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU SOUND MORE THAN A LITTLE PARANOID WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT.
this IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. HOW IS THIS POLICE WORK?
Oh, I'M KIDDING WITH YOU. I GET BORED.
see, THE THING IS, YOU HAVE HEARD OF ZACHARIAH.
you KNOW WHO ZACHARIAH IS, AND YOU'RE SCARED OF ZACHARIAH.
and WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHY. LET'S PUT A PIN IN THAT, SHALL WE?
we HAVE INFORMATION PUTTING JUSTIN PRENTISS AT MR. WINSTON'S HOUSE THE NIGHT HE WENT AWOL.
so SAYS MR. WINSTON. HAS HE ANY PROOF?
why WOULD HE LIE? BECAUSE HE'S A CRAZY OLD MAN WITH GRUDGE AGAINST THIS SCHOOL.
perhaps HE'S CRAZY ENOUGH TO DO SOMETHING.
he's COMPLAINED PLENTY OF TIMES. THERE'S NEVER ANY REALITY TO IT.
chief BRODY DISAGREES.
she THINKS THAT SOME OF YOUR STUDENTS ARE VANDALS, AND YOU'RE PROTECTING THEM.
chief BRODY IS A SMALL TOWN COP. SHE GETS IDEAS IN HER HEAD.
look, THE TRUTH IS THAT NOBODY AROUND HERE LIKES US VERY MUCH.
they THINK THE KIDS ARE ALL DRUG ADDICTS AND DELINQUENTS. THEY'RE SCARED.
you DON'T MIND IF WE SIT DOWN WITH SOME OF YOUR STUDENTS TO ASK THEM ABOUT MR. WINSTON'S ALLEGATIONS?
not AT ALL...
as LONG AS YOU FOLLOW PROPER LEGAL PROTOCOL.
of COURSE.
Hey, HEY, HEY!
agent LISBON OF THE CBI WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MOMENT.
let's ALL LISTEN WITH RESPECTFUL ATTENTION, ALL RIGHT?
Jane, THEY'RE ALL YOURS.
Hello, KIDS. HEY.
uh, THAT'S THE BEST YOU GOT?
Hello, KIDS.
Hello!
Ah, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
who WANTS TO SEE SOME MAGIC?
hands? GOOD.
watch ME CLOSELY.
concentrate.
make SURE I DON'T DO ANYTHING SNEAKY.
all RIGHT, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. HUSH.
watching MY HANDS...
I'm GONNA NEED A VOLUNTEER.
you.
stand UP. COME HERE.
name?
well, ORRIN, TODAY'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.
I'm GOING TO LOOK INTO YOUR MIND,
and I'M GONNA READ YOUR THOUGHTS.
you're THINKING, "GOSH, I HOPE HE CAN'T READ MY THOUGHTS, "BECAUSE THEN HE'D KNOW THAT I WAS UP IN THE WOODS "WITH JUSTIN PRENTISS THE NIGHT BEFORE HE DIED THROWING PAINT BOMBS AT THE OLD CRAZY MAN'S DOOR.
Orrin, THAT WAS KIND OF DUMB.
you SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE INNOCENT.
we're GONNA HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE TALK.
follow ME.
sorry ABOUT THAT.
tell ME MORE ABOUT ZACHARIAH.
Orrin, YOU MAY ASK FOR A LAWYER AT ANY TIME. THEN MY PARENTS SHOULD KNOW RIGHT?
Yes.
that's OKAY.
Zachariah AND THE Z KREW.
why SHOULD I TELL YOU? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING.
Yeah. BUT IT WOULD BE MORE POLITE IF YOU SAID IT ALOUD FOR THEIR BENEFIT.
you CAN'T REALLY READ MINDS, CAN YOU?
shrewd INSIGHT. NO, OF COURSE I CAN'T.
then HOW'D YOU DO THAT, THEN-- CALL ME OUT LIKE THAT?
you SCRATCHED YOUR POISON OAK RASH, AND MY COLLEAGUES TELL ME THAT ONLY GROWS IN ONE PLACE AROUND HERE
up AT MR. WINSTON'S. FUDGE.
Yeah. SO TELL ME MORE ABOUT ZACHARIAH.
I CAN'T.
Really?
and THAT'S GONNA INVVE YOUR PARENTS AND LAWYERS.
Zachariah WAS A LUMBERJACK...
hundreds OF YEARS AGO.
a LOG FELL ON HIM IN THE RIVER AND PINNED HIM BY THE ARM.
the RIVER WAS RISING, AND A SNOWSTORM WAS COMING.
they FIGURED THAT HE WAS DONE FOR ANYWAY.
so THEY LEFT HIM THERE-- LEFT HIM FOR DEAD.
Zachariah WAS SO ANGRY AT THEM FOR LEAVING HIM
that HE CHOPPED OFF HIS OWN ARM TO FREE HIMSELF,
then WENBACK TO THE LUMBER CAMP AND HACKED EVERY ONE OF HIS WORKMATES TO DEATH,
then CHOPPED 'EM UP AND PUT THEIR HEADS IN TREES.
cool.
the LUMBER CAMP WHERE THEY DIED...
this IS IT.
right HERE.
this SCHOOL IS THE EXACT SAME SPOT.
and Z KREW? IT'S LIKE A SECRET CLUB.
we GO UP IN THE WOODS AND DO STUFF.
Zachariah IS LIKE OUR LEADER.
who's LIKE THE DEPUTY LEADER? I DON'T KNOW.
no? COME ON.
we WEAR MASKS. THE ONLY PERSON YOU KNOW IS THE PERSON WHO ASKED YOU TO JOIN THE GANG.
who WAS THAT?
there HE IS.
I GOT THIS. NO, PLEASE. I GOT THIS.
after YOU.
nice.
who INITIATED YOU TO Z KREW, BRYAN? THE GUY THAT JUMPED ME IN ?
who RUNS Z KREW? I DON'T KNOW.
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ANYBODY'S VOICE.
there's NO TALKING ON Z KREW OPS.
we ONLY COMMUNICATE BY NOTE AND SIGN LANGUAGE.
that's THE WHOLE FUN OF IT. LOOK,
Z KREW'S ABOUT RUNNING AROUND IN THE WOODS, PLAYING WARRIORS.
nobody GETS KILLED.
Z KREW'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH JUSTIN'S MURDER.
do YOU?
No!
you WANT MY GUESS?
guesswork IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIS SORT OF SITUATION, BRYAN.
GUESSWORK'S OKAY.
she's IN IT SOMEHOW.
how SO?
Justin WAS...
he WAS BIG IN LOVE WITH HER.
she WOULDN'T DEAL, AND HE DIDN'T LIKE IT.
I SAW THEM ARGUING, BOTH REAL MAD, A COUPLE DAYS AGO.
and NOW SHE'S TOTALLY FREAKED OUT ABOUT HIS DEATH. SO, YOU KNOW...
many OF US ARE UPSET, RYAN.
does CASSIE HAVE A BOYFRIEND? NO.
so WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED? CASSIE KILLED HIM?
that's RIDICULOUS.
let HIM ANSWER.
hey... ASK HER.
all I'M SAYING... IT WASN'T ME.
I'm SURE THAT SHE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
but I WILL HAVE SOMEONE FETCH HER FOR YOU.
gave YOU A LITTLE TROUBLE, HUH? NAH.
Hey, GUYS.
what HAPPENED TO YOU? OLD AGE.
shut UP, YOU.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE? GEE, THANKS FOR THE WELCOME.
no, I MEAN-- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
lisbon WANTED AN EXTRA HAND IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INTERVIEW ALL THE STUDENTS AND STAFF. SERIOUSLY? THIS IS THE BIGGEST THEY HAD?
Hey, VAN PELT. HEY, BOSS.
we're SHORT A GIRL BY THE NAME CASSIE MINIVER.
Bryan SAYS THAT JUSTIN WAS IN LOVE TH CASSIE, RECENTLY SAW THEM IN A FIERCE ARGUMENT.
Oh, CASSIE. YEAH, SHE BROUGHT MACLEAN A CUP OF TEA.
Yeah. WE WANTED TO QUESTION HER, BUT SHE'S GONE. HMM. INTERESTING.
anybody ELSE MISSING? NO, THERE ISN'T.
so SHE'S MOST LIKELY RUNNING, NOT ABDUCTED. PRECISELY.
so WHAT DO YOU THINK, BOSS? CHIEF BRODY'S SETTING UP A FULL-SCALE SEARCH, SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY START LOOKING IN THE WOODS AROUND THE SCHOOL.
Oh, THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLY TEDIOUS.
shout IF YOU NEED ME.
go AHEAD, RELAX. ENJOY YOURSELF.
God FORBID YOU SHOULD DO ANYTHING TEDIOUS.
can I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
would YOU-- HAVE YOU EVER READ YOUR COWORKER'S PERSONNEL FILES?
uh... NO. WHY?
no, UH, GOOD. NEITHER DID I.
Hey.
Hi.
where ARE YOU HEADED?
into TOWN.
excellent. THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I NEED TO GO.
all RIGHT.
Thanks. GRATEFUL.
would YOU SHUT THE GATE FOR ME, PLEASE?
uh, NOPE. WHY?
well, 'CAUSE AS SOON AS I GET OUT OF THE CAR,
then YOU'LL DRIVE AWAY WITHOUT ME.
why ON EARTH WOULD I DO THAT?
the THREE FURIES
fear, SHAME, GUILT.
what?
the HEART WANTS WHAT THE HEART WANTS, AND IT WON'T BE DENIED. IT MAKES US DO BAD THINGS.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
Cassie, I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU.
Cassie? NEEDN'T BE SHY.
Hi.
Hi.
here.
try IT ON.
beautiful.
what IS THIS?
Mr. MACLEAN WAS HELPING CASSIE RUN AWAY.
Why? HE DIDN'T WANT US TO SPEAK TO HER BECAUSE...
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. NONSENSE. YOU HAVE PLENTY TO SAY.
and FIND OUT THAT SHE AND HE WERE HAVING WHAT YOU WOULD CALL, UH... SEXUAL RELATIONS.
is THAT TRUE?
I'm SAYING NOTHING. I ADMIT NOTHING.
I WANT TO TALK TO MY LAWYER. CASSIE!
don't SAY ANYTHING. YOU MISERABLE LITTLE PERVERT!
that's ENOUGH, CHIEF. SHE ASSAULTED ME!
I DON'T THINK SO. WE'RE GOING BACK TO SACRAMENTO.
now YOU CAN EITHER COME OF YOUR OWN ACCORD OR WE CAN ARREST YOU. WHICH IS IT?
fine.
good CHOICE.
no. WE DIDN'T.
we--we WEREN'T. NO.
look AT ME. IT'S VERY EASY TO SEE WHEN YOU'RE LYING.
you GET A LITTLE PULSE GOING IN YOUR NECK JUST... THERE.
Yeah.
always BEST TO TELL AGENT LISBON THE TRUTH.
did MR. MACLEAN HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH YOU?
it's OKAY.
Yes, HE DID.
one TIME OR MORE THAN THAT?
more.
maybe TWICE A WEEK FOR A FEW MONTHS.
you KNOW THAT BY HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH YOU, MR. MACLEAN WAS COMMITTING A CRIME, RIGHT?
I GUESS.
was IT CONSENSUAL?
I GUESS.
you GUESS.
uh, DID YOU WANT MR. MACLEAN TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU?
no, MA'AM.
so HE COERCED YOU.
no, MA'AM.
I DON'T... UNDERSTAND.
I WAS SCARED.
scared OF WHO? MR. MACLEAN?
no, HE'S JUST... A SAD CREEP.
who, THEN?
you CAN TALK FREELY, CASSIE. YOU'RE SAFE HERE.
nowhere IS SAFE.
Zachariah MADE YOU DO IT?
zombie LUMBERJACK MADE YOU SLEEP WITH MR. MACLEAN.
he TOLD ME I HAD TO.
Cassie, YOU KNOW THAT ZACHARIAH DOESN'T EXIST.
you KNOW THAT KID THAT THEY FOUND CHOPPED UP IN THE WOODS?
he THOUGHT THE SAME THING.
okay, HOW--HOW DOES ZACHARIAH TELL YOU HIS WISHES?
through SOMEBODY FROM Z KREW, MAYBE?
I've SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY.
I DON'T--I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYMORE.
please DON'T MAKE ME.
I'll BE RIGHT BACK.
Cassie MADE A STATEMENT.
charge MR. MACLEAN WITH STATUTORY RAPE.
will DO, BOSS.
sex WITH A MINOR. TELL YOU WHAT THINGS LOOK VERY BAD FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.
I WAS KIND AND CARING TO A TROUBLED GIRL. THAT--THAT'S ALL.
Yeah, THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY... UNTIL THE LAB TESTS COME BACK.
see, THE WAY WE HAVE TO FIGURE THIS IS THAT JUSTIN Prentiss WAS IN LOVE WITH CASSIE
and FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE ABUSING HER. OH, PLEASE.
abusing HER, AND HE THREATENED TO TELL THE AUTHORITIES. SO YOU CLUBBED HIM TO DEATH,
you THOUGHT, AND BURIED HIM. NO. NO!
no? WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THINKING.
how ARE WE WRONG?
did HE ATTACK YOU?
was IT SELF-DEFENSE, MAYBE?
I WANT MY LAWYER. I'M SAYING NOTHING MORE TO YOU PEOPLE.
we GOT NOTHING TO PUT HIM WITH JUSTIN THAT NIGHT.
we NEED A CONFESSION.
you WON'T GET ONE.
why WON'T WE GET ONE?
prize FOR THE FIRST ONE TO TELL ME THE ANSWER.
just TELL US YOUR DAMN THEORY.
will DO THAT ON OUR WAY BACK TO BRIGHT ARCH.
we NEED TO GET THERE IN TIME FOR THE SACRED FIRE RITUAL.
Rigsby, LET'S YOU AND I HAVE A QUICK CUP OF TEA, THEN WE'LL GO, HUH?
explain FIRST. THEN WE'LL GO.
sacred FIRE?
Hello, KIDS.
good TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN.
pretty DRAMATIC FEW DAYS, HUH?
you PROBABLY HEARD A LOT OF CRAZY STUFF ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON.
well... DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
life GOES ON.
your TEACHERS THOUGHT I'D BE GOOD TO CARRY ON WITH THE SACRED FIRE CEREMONY AS USUAL.
everyone OKAY WITH THAT?
excellent.
I THOUGHT WE'D START WITH A GHOST STORY.
you ALL KNOW ABOUT ZACHARIAH, YEAH?
we DO.
but WE DON'T TALK ABT HIM. IT'S BAD LUCK.
Zachariah DOESN'T SCARE ME.
so EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT THAT TERRIBLE EVENING WHEN ZACHARIAH HACKED HIS FORMER FRIENDS TO PIECES, YEAH?
what A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT HORRIBLE INCIDENT.
as PUNISHMENT,
the TOWNSPEOPLE GATHERED TOGETHER
and BUILT A HUGE BONFIRE RIGHT HERE...
on THIS VERY SPOT.
and THEY BURNED ZACHARIAH ALIVE.
and AS THE FLAMES MELTED THE FLESH FROM HIS BODY,
Zachariah DIDN'T SCREAM.
he JUST SMILED AT THOSE WATCHING.
and HE MADE A SOLEMN VOW
that WHENEVER SOMEONE DOES EVIL IN THESE WOODS, IF YOU CALL ZACHARIAH'S NAME THREE TIMES
and MARK THE GROUND WITH A "Z," THEN HE WILL RISE FROM THE GRAVE AND HE WILL TAKE THEM.
Yeah, RIGHT.
and IF THE SINNER DOESN'T CONFESS HIS SINS, IF HE DOESN'T REPENT, THEN ZACHARIAH WILL DRAG THEM DOWN INTO HIS GHASTLY LAIR,
to SUFFER WITH HIM IN BLACK DARKNESS
for ALL ETERNITY.
that's IT?
Yes, THAT'S IT.
that WAS WEAK, DUDE.
well, IT'S ONLY WEAK IF THE CURSE ISN'T TRUE.
and WE ALL KNOW THAT EVIL HAS BEEN DONE IN THESE WOODS.
but IS THERE ANYONE HERE WILLING TO CALL ZACHARIAH'S NAME?
anyone?
told YOU. WEAK.
you FORGOT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.
you HAVE TO MARK THE GROUND WITH A "Z.
guess HE'S ON VACATION.
elliott, WAS IT YOU?
did YOU KILL JUSTIN?
elliott, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE.
did YOU KILL JUSTIN? YES! YES, IT WAS ME!
saved. THAT WAS CLOSE.
Oh, HEY, RIGSBY. HEY.
I-I-I KNEW IT WAS A JOKE.
I-I WAS JUST KIDDING.
no, YOU'RE A LIAR AND A MURDERER, ELLIOT.
everyone CAN SEE THAT.
whoa, WHOA, WHOA, A LITTLE HELP HERE.
give IT UP, KID. COME ON. IT'S OVER.
Justin WAS AN INSECT.
he SHOULDN'T HAVE INTERFERED.
Yes. YOU HAD A SWEET LITTLE SYSTEM GOING.
you KEPT THE KIDS IN LINE WITH MESSAGES FROM ZACHARIAH,
and YOU KEPT MACLEAN IN LINE WITH BLACKMAIL.
protect ELLIOT AND LET THE Z KREW RULE,
or BE EXPOSED AS A HABITUAL RAPIST. YOU'RE A VERY CLEVER YOUNG MAN.
Yes, I AM.
that's WHY MY PARENTS ABANDONED ME IN THIS DUMP.
I'm TOO CLEVER FOR THEM.
and FOR YOU.
you HAVEN'T REALLY CAUGHT ME.
I'm A MINOR. NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO ME.
then WHY DON'T YOU TELL US WHY YOU KILLED JUSTIN?
for THE RECORD.
you KNOW WHY.
Justin WAS ALWAYS SOFT ON CASSIE.
but WHEN HE FOUND OUT
what SHE WAS DOING WITH MACLEAN ON MY ORDER...
he GOT ANGRY, THREATENED TO RUIN EVERYTHING.
and I TRIED TO SHUT HIM UP WITH A MESSAGE FROM ZACHARIAH.
he WOULDN'T BACK OFF.
he LAUGHED AT ME.
he SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
I DON'T LIKE BEING LAUGHED AT.
well, GOOD-BYE, ELLIOT.
H-HEY.
how DID YOU KNOW IT WAS ME?
when CASSIE BROUGHT MACLEAN TEA IN A CUP WITH Z's ON IT,
that WAS A WARNING FROM YOU TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.
you WERE THE FIRST TO BRING FORTH THE ZACHARIAH STORY,
and YOU'VE BEEN AT THIS SCHOOL LONGER THAN ANYONE ELSE,
with NO DESIRE TO AVE.
the SACRED FIRE CEREMONY CONFIRMED MY HUNCH.
everybody ELSE WAS SCARED THAT I WAS INVOKING ZACHARIAH,
but YOU--YOU WERE CONTEMPTUOUS AND CYNICAL.
a TRUE ARTIST WATCHING A CHEAP IMITATOR...
until FEAR MADE YOU A BELIEVER.
it CAN DO THAT TO YOU.
Bye.
sit DOWN.
I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE.
it's OUR JOB.
thank YO YEAH.
Oh, THERE HE IS.
uh, HERE I AM.
I WAS JUST TELLING MR. AND MRS. Prentiss
it WAS YOU THAT FOUND THEIR SON'S KILLER.
Yes, UH, I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
thank YOU.
thank YOU SO MUCH.
we're VERY GRATEFUL.
it GIVES US SOME KIND OF CLOSURE AT LEAST.
your SON DIED BRAVELY.
he SAVED A YOUNG GIRL IN TROUBLE.
you SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.

Yes.
he's in the pool house. Name's james smithson-, British citizen.
he's a high-priced tutor for local kids. Daughter of the homeowner's one of the students.
couple months ago they let him move in here.
Rigsby, can you find out why the coroner's not here?
Yeah, sure.
who found the body? You?
she was coming in for a lesson.
she called her dad. He called me.
why us exactly?
I don't know- - what the hell, Vic?
you were supposed to call me the second they got here.
excuse me, sir?
.This is a crime scene.
it's my place.
.can you do that for me?
I'll expect a full report.
body.
that's why I called you.
old california money, lots of clout. Local p. D. Won't cut it. He wants the best.
coroner's on his way.
a single gunshot. No weapon.
don't worry. It's a visual inspection. Didn't touch a thing.
no sign of assault or robbery?
real fancy résumé, this guy.
graduated from eton and oxford.
last employer was some hotshot prep school back east.
meh, I wouldn't be so sure.
excuse me? - The facial scar.
eton boy gets a cut on his head, and he needs a plastic surgeon, he gets a plastic surgeon.
my guess-the whole résumé is a fairy tale.
excuse me? - You're excused.
I.
well, I'm wrong then.
no blisters or calluses on his hands. A lot of dirt under his fingernails.
who is this guy? - It's a long story.
anything else? alarm.
yeah .
I got the call at 3: 35 i was at a client's residence nearby, working an alarm upgrade.
arrived here at 3: 52.
body was still warm, so I guess the time of death was a good hour before that.
what - Guess again.
it's calledlazarus syndrome.
guy's heart somehow caughtan electrical charge and restarted. Hey, it happens.
alive?
well, if you can call that living. He's brain-dead.
with no oxygenfor more than ten minutes, there's security cameras out there. Have bandino show youthe footage.
maybe we'll get lucky and catch a look at the shooter.
I need to goand talk to the little girl who found the body.
you got it.
what are you looking for?
the dirt under his nailssmelled like rosemary.
Yeah.
whatever was inside this boxkilled our man.
well, the case ispractically closed.
there's no reason to besnarky.
it was my wife jolene, really.
she saw how much james helped lanie with her schoolwork, and when she heardhe needed a place to live, she rented the pool houseto him.
I don't know. A couple of months, maybe.
very generousof your wife.
Jolene has a big heart.
is this her?
my muse. - Good-looking.
she turned meinto a real artist.
before I met her, I was taking snapshots.
banks, we're gonna needto talk to your daughter.
sorry Lanie's too upsetto talk at the moment.
please. Maybe later. We need to speak to herwhen her memory's fresh.
she saw what you saw.
she came home, went to the pool house.
we're gonna have to hear that from her.
and she found a dead body. She's years old. Don't-don't you get it?
it's a project about the pyramids.
I can talk to you. - Thanks, lanie.
sit right here, sweetie.
I'm agent Lisbon, and that's Patrick Jane.
Hi. What do you have to dofor the pyramid project?
describe the afterlife as depicted inthe ancient egyptian mythology.
Ah, as depicted inthe ancient egyptian mythology.
well, did you know that they believed that when you die, you are carriedinto the next life on the backof a sacred hippopotamus? That's true.
what time did you get homefrom school? - A little after:
what did you do? - I made lemonade.
James loves my lemonade.
who else was home?
uh, I was at the gallery, and jolene was at the gym.
Mr. Banks, please. - No one was here.
I took the lemonadeto the pool house.
I saw so much blood.
did you see anybodyor hear anything? Voices? A car?
just james.
I'm taking her upstairs now.
does anybody knowwhat was inside this?
no. Are we through? - Almost.
Lanie, why didn't your mother want you to speak to us?
she's not my mother.
honey, it-it's okay.
I was protecting her. She's been througha very traumatic experience.
Oh, I thought you were worriedshe was gonna say something about whatever it is you'retrying to hide from us.
how dare you? - Really? Howdarei?
is that the best comebackyou've got?
you're gonna let this maninsult me? - Huh?
stand there with your mouth open like a moron.
baby. Baby. Really?
well played. - Yeah. I'm starving.
hopper Banks's Home Studio
we've got four cameras in the backyard.
we ran the footage from sunup till we got here.
check this out.
we found this at: Watch the window.
wh-what camera had the door?
this is the only image we've got.
nobody coming in or out or in the yard?
whoever shot smithson knew where those cameras were placed and how to avoid 'em.
if you want one, I can make one for you.
we need to check jolene and hopper's alibis.
you know, hold on a second. None of these cameras are hidden. Anyone can see 'em
guests, students coming here for tutoring, their parents, everybody - Good point. - Thanks for your time, mr. Bandino.
thank you. Cheers.
the victim, James Smithson, doesn't exist.
passport's fake. His references are bogus.
I ran his prints through all the databases. There's nothing, nothing at all.
your friend bandino didn't do much of a background check.
that's not like him.
he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer, do you think maybe he's holding something back, - yeah, I'll check it out. - Take van pelt.
just stop worrying. It's gonna be fine with the new boss.
I mean, sure, there'll be a settling-in period when she probes your psyche for weakness, - but once that's out of the way- - would you stop? You're being so childish.
I think you're the one who's nervous.
let me think about that.
it's definitely you.
I'm gonna go talk to smithson's regular students and their parents, fill in some of these blanks.
good idea. Take him with you.
come on.
Blankman Residence Citrus Heights, California
my god. It's so terrible. Do you have any idea who did it?
we're still investigating, mrs. Blankman.
now the parents and students we've talked to all say he was a great tutor, but not much else.
how well did you know mr. Smithson?
not that well.
James four months.
I'd drop off, pick up. You know, say hello. He seemed nice.
e- excuse me, mrs. Blankman. I-I'm sorry. Don't mean to interrupt.
I'm a little parched. Could i bother you for a cup of tea?
I didn't offer you- - oh, n-n-no, please. I-I can get it. You're shaking.
would you like a cup? Cho? - No, thanks.
your son never mentioned anything? Money problems? Anything unusual?
they just studied.
smelled so good, I went and made you one.
lemongrass, my favorite.
Yeah, it's funny how smells work. They attach themselves to such specific memories.
you know, like the, uh, kitchen of a childhood home, or having a cup of tea with a lover.
Yes. - Yes.
Yes, you and James were lovers.
Yes.
Oh, you might not want to drink that. That's a little... Funky monkey.
what kind of background check did you do, Vic?
the usual. I checked his well, james smithson isn't james smithson.
well, there's a limit to what i can do, you know? I'm not the cia, here.
Aw, come on, man. You used to be more gung-ho than that.
that's why I'm not a cop anymore. It's too stressful. Unhealthy profession.
Yeah, no kidding.
Hey, you got anything?
seriously, you hear about hank harrison?
39Years old, years out from his pension-- boom. Heart attack.
a wife, two kids.
he had that, uh, that bachelor party, remember?
uh, no.
Aw, come on. Sure you do.
the stripper was all over his case, I'm telling ya.
I bet she was.
are you two, like, uh-- are you dating each other?
no, we're not.
no. Because you both looked a little weird just now.
no.
we're talking about a murder here.
Yeah. Yeah, hey, look, I'm sorry, all right?
uh, there is one thing.
a couple months ago, Hopper was working on this photo thing.
he, uh--he asked me to get him a gun.
old-fashioned piece, like the fbi was using in some 's movie he saw.
like a . 38?
Yeah, I guess. We never got to that. I turned him down.
told him if he wanted it like the movie, get a prop gun.
I don't know what he did in the end, - Yeah, it is.
Thanks, man. Appreciate it. - Hey, absolutely.
thanks for your help.
Yeah, no problem. Hey, listen.
what say you and me go get a cup of coffee some time?
no, thanks.
I'm a nice guy, right, Rigs?
see ya later, Vic.
so smithson was a big ladies' man, and they've both got solid alibis.
Maggie blankman's husband's been in reno for the last three days, and maggie was at a therapist's session from2 00: to4 00: p. M.-- double session.
Jane and i are gonna go to hopper's gallery, ask about the gun.
want a coffee?
no, thanks.
so what was her name? - Who?
the stripper.
we could double-date-- me and bandino, you and your stripper.
that's mean. - Kidding.
Oh, her name was, uh, kandy.
Kandy with a "k.
do I own a gun? - Yes, mr. Banks, a . 38.
have you ever been in possession of one or owned one?
I never had a gun, any kind.
I don't believe in them.
you're just not trying hard enough.
I am.
you just can't read minds.
you close your eyes, okay? I'm the boss here.
concentrate.
swirl. Huh?
vanilla. Pay up.
that's not funny.
Yeah, it is.
Hey, dad, just getting ice cream.
okay.
uh, would you mind taking a polygraph test?
no. Why would i do that?
I'll give you this, hopper-- you have a very consistent vision.
a little crazy, but consistent.
I wouldn't expect you to understand what i'm doing.
let me give it a shot.
you enjoy taking possession of your wife, but only on camera, not in the flesh.
you were being cuckolded by james smithson, and you let it happen. Why?
Impotence? Masochism?
homosexuality? I'm not sure.
that's very perceptive, mr. Jane.
you have a talent.
I do. Thanks.
it's an easy call.
you're very attractive but unhappy and accustomed to using your sexuality as a weapon.
did you use your sexuality as a weapon against him?
go.
what does it take to get you mad, hopper?
that's ridiculous! - What's wrong?
uh, these people were just leaving.
Yeah, we should leave. - Let's go.
okay. How's the ice cream? Yeah. - Good
hard to beat vanilla.
I know, I know.
you were making stuff up to get the guy angry blah, blah, blah.
the truth is, you just didn't like the guy.
well, that would be very unprofessional.
um, could you take the next left, please?
okay. Well, what did you read? Did he do it?
take the next left, and I'll tell you.
well? - Well, maybe.
he had a good motive.
and maybe not. The red box didn't fit.
you picked up a tail?
nothing.
you sure?
excuse me.
why are you following us?
following you?
shoot, I thought california was friendly.
I'm just trying to make a sale here--life insurance.
cute young couple like yourselves, now you've gotta think about the future, right?
you got kids yet?
disguised british, yes?
you gotta work on your glottal stop.
his what? - his glottal stop.
can we see some identification, please?
I'll--hold on, I'll get it.
put your hands on the car.
now.
what's this about?
turn around.
,you ask them to show you theirs first.
unless, of course, you're trying to hide something.
quite right. Quite right, mr. Jane.
who are you?
inspector francis slocombe.
scotland yard special branch.
thank you.
I can't reach your contact at scotland yard.
time difference. Tricky one, that.
Yep, francis slocombe, registered at the flamingo hotel.
Where's jane? - Here.
did you check liverpool's score?
up -nothing. End of the first half.
excellent.
where are the cucumber sandwiches?
I'm being nice to him, because i think he might know what was in oh, - what about our search warrant - you're not even a bit curious?
after your performance at the gallery, banks made some phone calls.
now judge withers won't sign the warrant.
sorry. Uh, she's a little cranky.
did his story check out? - no
about James Smithson-- his real name's Oliver Stans.
nine months ago he stole an extremely valuable artifact from the british museum
a pristine example of greco-roman art circa b. C.
a wedding ring, said to belong to cleopatra, given her by mark antony.
that's what was in the box.
here's a copy from the museum gift shop.
stans lifted the ring and replaced it with one of those.
what was he doing in the united states?
he knew we were building a case against him.
changed his name, disappeared.
a week ago we picked up chatter that a dealer in stolen antiquities was gonna buy the ring here, had sent someone to pick it up.
may I?
go-to courier in the high-end stolen art market.
I followed him here to stans and the ring, but i arrived too late.
that's why I was following you.
Anglet has the ring now, and I need to get back on the trail.
you're not going anywhere until your story checks out.
whoever killed stans killed him for the ring.
slocombe to an interrogation room.
sit on him while I make a call.
sure.
let's go.
James smithson is oliver stans.
a few minor arrests-- narcotics possession charge, assault.
looks like a bar fight.
and yes, a person of interest in the british the hospital called.
they need someone to sign off on organ donation.
Stans' mother was a single parent.
died three years ago. No siblings.
Cho, come with me. We need to ask slocombe some questions.
his gun's gone.
I'll get a search started.
Ron, can you nine months ago when the ring was lifted, he went off the reservation.
he's been tracking stans ever since.
you think he helped with the robbery , no, slocombe's just trying to get the ring back.
" Why?" is the big question.
you two, go to his motel room. See if you can find anything there that'll help us.
okay.
I got a grid search started.
this is perfect. It's perfect.
agent lisbon.
madeleine Hightower.
special agent hightower, welcome.
thank you. - This is patrick jane.
the famous mr. Jane.
good to meet you.
you, too.
I thought I'd have a nice, quiet day today, but it seems like there's trouble.
we lost somebody.
we're looking for him.
then I'm sure you'll find him.
let's talk in my office. Give me a half-hour to roll some calls.
Yes, ma'am.
she likes you. I can tell.
I've stayed in worse places.
that's shocking.
very firm.
you wanna try it?
Oh, come on.
we can lock the door. Nobody's looking. Come on.
we're on duty.
Yeah, I know. Totallywrong.
come on. What?
hold that thought.
what you got?
Eureka.
now does that mean you can get back here?
Yes, it could be, but unless the critical evidence self-destructs in less than ten seconds, i suggest you get yourself back here.
it's critical.
fine. Room's good. Thank you.
come in.
ma'am, I assure you, today's incident is not at all indicative of the unit's overall confidence.
you had a bad day, agent lisbon.
you screwed up.
it happens.
now let's get to the work.
this judge, the one who changed his mind about giving us our search warrant judge withers, ma'am.
he's kinda like a stubborn old bull
won't budge once he takes a position.
and he changed his mind because?
he said we hadn't met the threshold.
not what he said.
the real reason.
Patrick Jane insulted Hopper Banks, Jane has unusual methods, but-- he closes cases, yes, he does.
we cannot afford to lose him.
it's you that's in a tricky spot.
ma'am?
this bureau has seen some tough times lately.
my mission is to turn that around and make the cbi the premier law enforcement agency in this state.
Patrick jane is a huge part of that goal.
if you can't keep him in line, we'll find someone who can.
Yes, ma'am.
you can go.
I'll give judge withers a call, get you a warrant.
hey boss
according to the information slocombe dug up, louis anglet doesn't just deal in stolen antiquities.
he's a hired gun, never indicted, but a prime suspect in three kills.
he's still here.
multiple I. D.s, multiple arrests, but no jail time.
he looks good for it.
we don't even know where anglet is.
what we do know is that every time slocombe opens his mouth, he lies.
in the meantime, let's just pursue the case we're developing.
hopper banks is still our prime suspect.
let's check out his house for the gun.
we don't have a search warrant.
we do now.
Hightower got withers to sign off on it.
Hey. - Hey, about the gun did you find anything?
if you did, I hope you keep my name out of it - go away, mr. Bandino.
nothing so far.
I got some more guys coming.
agent lisbon, what is the cbi equivalent of siberia?
because whatever it is, that's where you're going.
hold that thought, mr. Banks.
look what I found in the home office.
it's a picture of a colt, detective special,
Caliber,-inch barrel the same kind of gun killed our victim.
a prop.
why don't we sort out which one at our offices, mr. Banks?
Oh, Oliver, you idiot.
you bloody idiot.
who's that?
come out or i will shoot.
uh, I checked for you.
liverpool lost.
bad season, huh?
injuries.
you're expecting me, then?
nice work.
Oh, you dropped everything, you risked your whole career to, uh, find him before your colleagues at the yard.
you followed us after he was shot.
you're both liverpool fans.
he's family.
your son?
Yeah.
my son.
I was no father to him.
never married his mother.
never spent time with him at all, really.
but I kept track.
I tried.
and look at him now.
look at my boy.
he was a brilliant young man.
from nothing, under his own steam, he got himself a scholarship to cambridge to study classics.
that's what got him invited to preview the museum's new collection.
and he stole the ring.
that was an impulsive act.
he's not a thief.
he's a foolish, rebellious kid.
he took a copy of the ring in with him.
it wasn't an impulsive act.
it was a plan.
he's not a thief.
you believe that, and that was your plan.
if you could just talk to him,
as you say, not a thief.
I could have.
if I made it in time, I could have done that.
and now you track down his killer and kill them.
Yeah, well, you know how that works.
I read all about you, mr. Jane.
I know what happened.
well, you'll end up in prison.
maybe.
but right now I'm gonna walk out of here, and you're gonna let me.
you're holding a gun, and i have no real reason to stop you.
thanks for being sensible.
it's my middle name - Hey - hey i'm having a private word with everyone here to kinda set the tone.
cool. It's, uh, an excellent practice.
have a seat. - Thank you.
told her how deeply I value your contribution to the bureau.
nice to hear.
I told her you're too good to lose to some smart-ass move you might make that turns bad.
I told her that if and when it happens, it's her neck.
you're golden.
you're safe for anything short of murder.
you mess up, she's out of here.
any questions?
not that i can think of right now.
good.
thank you for your time.
I look forward to working with you.
likewise.
thank you.
see you around.
I knew the purchase was illegal.
I just didn't want to get in trouble.
ironic.
I haven't seen it since the shoot, which is what, like six weeks ago?
I thought it might be somewhere in my studio, but you guys would have found it, I guess.
that's not very credible.
it's the truth.
boss? - Yeah.
I was going through the files on banks' laptop, and i found this and this in his telephone records.
Cho, you mind?
all yours.
banks, do you know anything about the theft of a ring at the british museum?
Cleopatra's wedding ring, supposedly.
no.
Why?
we checked your browser history on your office computer.
you looked up the theft of the ring two months ago, right after you let stans move into your pool house.
downloaded quite a bit about it.
I never did this.
you also made several phone calls to a man named louis anglet who we believe may have purchased the ring.
I've never heard of him.
the calls are in your phone records.
I paid for overnight delivery.
A. M.
and it's not here yet.
well, if it gets here by then that'll be fine.
thank you.
van pelt brings hope.
uh, we've been tracking this anglet guy via cell phone.
off that, we got a bead on his credit card.
the thing is, someone else is tracking his purchases as well.
has to be slocombe.
this afternoon, anglet has a massage booked at the blue willow spa, right here in downtown sacramento.
slocombe will show up.
so good.
I got anglet.
bottle of water, please.
I see slocombe.
Anglet? - What?
got a question for you.
Oh, sorry, I think you have the wrong guy, but--hey.
did you kill my boy? - No.
did you kill my boy?
get off me!
CBI! On the ground!
Slocombe! Slocombe, drop the weapon!
drop it!
I saw red.
I'll end up in prison, just like you predicted.
very foolish.
no.
it's human nature.
Ah, it made me realize revenge is not for me.
pointless.
more violence is just more violence.
doesn't make anything any better.
mm, maybe.
to london tomorrow morning.
take it, and there'll be no charges pending.
thank you.
I don't want to see you again.
clear?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
thank you.
uh, th-that's mine.
Yep.
Francis slocombe, the man who was trying to kill you why was that?
I have no idea.
we know that slocombe was tracking you.
we know that you came here for the ring.
this ring must be very important.
everyone here seems to be talking about it.
what kind of ring is it?
agent lisbon.
excuse me.
Yeah, well, there's a reason why he hasn't been in jail.
that's his attorney.
probably gets about $1500, an hour.
let's spend a little time with him, run up the meter.
excuse me. I'm agent lisbon.
would you come to my office with me, please?
just up here.
Hi.
you don't look like my lawyer.
I'm not gonna answer any more questions.
no more questions.
you're too smart for that.
but what you did do is you bought cleopatra's wedding ring from his killer.
Oh, thecleopatra?
queen of the nile, the bride of mark antony?
and here's what you got $39 fakies.
considerably more if you have to get the overnight delivery.
not your fault.
no reason to think it was a fake, obviously.
stans did steal the ring.
that's why it's such a great scam.
he can sell the same ring over and over.
now the person you bought the ring for i'm guessing they paid more than $39 for it.
how much did they pay for it? Huh?
$200000?
more?
more than $200000?
I think they're gonna be pretty mad when they find out it's a fake.
what do you think?
Oh, man.
your attorney's waiting.
see you.
you stay. - Oh, I'm staying.
the phone and internet evidence suggests that hopper killed stans for the ring and sold it to anglet.
Yes, it does suggest that.
so you just put hopper in a great deal of danger.
Nah.
nah?
that's your considered reply?
Yep.
put a guard on hopper asap.
will do, boss.
you know, this is exactly the kind of scenario we talked about.
didn't think we'd get there so soon.
you butt is on the line, agent lisbon.
what did you do?
paid way too much for overnight delivery.
I'll put a team together, sir.
full protection /, my best guys.
banks, you don't understand
sure, your people convinced Anglet that I cheated him, and then turned him loose to kill me.
Yeah, that's--that's pretty much how it goes.
but for the record, agent lisbon had absolutely nothing to do jane
a-and we could have held anglet if you were man enough to admit selling him the ring in the first place.
that's it. Get out.
you better pray nothing happens to my family.
Oh, come on.
where is it?
I want the real ring now.
what are you talking about?
I gave it to you.
you sold me the fake.
I want the real one now.
I gave you the real one, all right?
trust me.
I put a gun in that guy's face.
there's no way he'd hand over a fake.
put the gun down! Drop the gun!
all right, all right, all right.
Hey, what did I do?
all right, relax.
on the ground!
put your hands on your head. - Let's see your hands.
up against the truck, Bandino.
go! Go! Let's see your hands.
Victor bandino, you're under arrest for the murder of oliver stans.
Yeah, you think being a cop's stressful?
try being a cop in prison, jerk.
I know my job.
I do good background checks.
I found out that smithson was really stans, found out about the ring.
I approached him. We talked.
he couldn't sell the ring. It was too hot.
but I know some people who know some people that put me in touch with anglet, and that was it.
I brokered the deal.
why'd you kill stans?
he changed his mind.
didn't want to sell it.
at the last minute, the idiot wanted to confess, return it to the museum.
what was I supposed to do?
you shot him.
I had no choice.
it was a spur of the moment thing.
right.
no premeditation, no death penalty.
the only thing?
you planned ahead.
you planted the phone and internet evidence on Hopper Banks.
that doesn't look good.
good bye son . OK
a b c d e
excuse me. Can I get a comment, please?
Yes, ma'am, keep it right back here.
stand back here, please.
captain. - Agent Lisbon.
don't think we'll be needing you guys.
we like the neighbor kid who found the body.
did he confess?
Ah, he's a real squirrel.
did you kill her?
Mercy's father would like to give a brief statement.
I just want to take a moment and thank everyone in law enforcement and all the volunteers who helped us in the search for our beloved daughter.
the way that this entire community has come together to support me and Juniper in this terrible time has been a great comfort to us.
and now I would just like to ask you that...
you give us some time, space and privacy to grieve for our daughter.
thank you.
Hello, Mrs. Tolliver.
who are you?
my name is Patrick Jane.
I'm here to help you.
would you like a cup of tea?
Yes, I would, thank you.
you must be tired.
why don't you sit down?
it's nice and quiet in here, isn't it?
quiet, soothing, calm.
calm.
I've been watching you and your husband,
and I want you to know that I understand what you're feeling right now.
you have no idea.
believe me. - I do.
I know.
I know, and I wanna help you.
you can't help me. You... What do you know?
all sorts of things.
you really only pretend to like skiing, right?
Yes, but
you're pleased that your best friend recently gained some weight
about 10 pounds.
you wish you'd been more adventurous when you were younger.
you love India, but you've never been there.
you have trouble sleeping.
your favorite color...
is blue.
I don't understand. You're...
you're psychic? - No.
just paying attention.
I used to make a good living pretending to be a psychic.
I tell you this because I want you to understand there's no point hiding things from me.
hiding... What?
know what I see when I look at your husband?
I see a warm, loving, generous man.
a little vain, maybe. Selfish, controlling-- but a decent man.
Yes.
so why do you suspect him of murdering your daughter?
I don't.
the Mccluskey boy did it. - Yes.
that's what the police say.
but you think they're wrong. Why?
I don't know. I-I-I don't know. I...
tell me.
last year, they--they have been so strange with each other.
and neither one would admit that anything was wrong, and I think that...
I think that she tried to tell me once, and I didn't--I...
God. Oh, god.
did you ask him if he killed her?
what would he say?
most wives can tell when their husbands are lying.
Yes. Yes.
I... I don't want tea. I-- the Mccluskey boy did it. I...
maybe.
you think he did it, too?
I trust a mother's instinct.
there you are.
who are you?
I'm the police. Did you kill your daughter?
how dare you?
I asked you a simple question, sir. Did you kill your daughter?
no. I did not kill my daughter!
now you get the hell out of my house!
june, what's the matter with you?
I'm gonna have your badge.
an innocent man would have punched me by now.
I am gonna make life miserable for you.
you come in here, you accost my wife, you cause trouble on
june, honey, please.
move! Move!
honestly, it--it's not as bad as it looks.
Mrs. Tolliver? Mrs. Tolliver! Please wait.
front room's clear!
palm Springs, California 2, Weeks Later
then the son of a bitch eagles 17.
are you kiddin' me?
on that course?
a damn eagle?
that course never suited you, Price.
we'll do better in Orlando.
we have a nice spot on the draw.
well, I'll tell you what.
Davis love III can kiss my butt.
palm Springs International Airport
flight 233 from Sacramento, you may claim your baggage from carousel 2.
flight 233 from Sacramento...
uh, sorry.
you checked luggage?
what are you, on vacation?
no, ma'am. Won't do it again.
when your trousseau arrives,
pick up the second rental and go direct to the sheriff's department,
hustle us up a couple of rooms, furniture and phone lines.
Yes. Ma'am.
come on. Let's go.
morning, everybody.
how was your flight?
go away. You're on suspension.
thank you.
mandated leave.
ends next week.
so come back next week.
hot enough for you?
which one of you jackasses told him?
it was you, wasn't it, Cho?
Yes, it was.
of course he called me.
it's Red John. You can't keep me out of this.
why would you want to?
you got a man killed. There's consequences.
Oh, a man that murdered his daughter 'cause she wouldn't have sex with him anymore?
you didn't know that. You did not know that.
if she hadn't had left a diary--- But she did, though.
be reasonable. This is my case.
your case?
red John's mine.
red John doesn't belong to anyone.
he belongs to me.
it's not my call. Rules are rules.
come back next week.
don't let this man past.
boss?
we have Gregory Tannen-- caucasian, male, 43, single.
we haven't opened him up yet, but burn marks...
sorry I went over your head.
I'll redeem myself, I promise.
you want redemption? Be silent.
okay. I can learn to do that.
sorry.
the burn marks here indicate that the victim was subdued with a stun gun
standard civilian model by the look of it.
death appears to be caused by several blows to the back of the skull consistent
with a bloodied golf club found at the scene.
female is Alison Randolph-- 27, married, no children.
they were found at her listed residence.
T.O.D. looks to be early saturday evening.
on Alison, we have the same stun gun marks,
followed by binding with tight black plastic ligatures,
frenzied cutting and stabbing assault of the torso and subsequent abuse of the viscera.
textbook Red John.
who found the bodies?
this one's husband, coming home from the airport Sunday morning with his brother.
he's a pro golfer. - Oh, yeah?
what's her deal with him? Do we know?
uh, he's on file as one of her physicians.
making a house call? - Lovers?
no, this one's gay.
Dr. Wagner might know what their relationship was.
he's here to make the formal I.D. ?
okay.
Dr. Wagner.
I'm agent Teresa Lisbon, California Bureau of Investigation.
what's your connection to the victims?
I work with Gregory...
Dr. Tannen and--and the Randolph family are longtime clients of our practice.
are house calls the norm at your practice?
no. Gregory and Alison were close friends.
lovers? - No.
he was gay.
no, they were just... Friends.
what in god's name happened to them?
looks like Red John.
who's Red John?
we don't know who did this.
we'll be in touch probably. Thank you.
set up right here?
Yeah, that's good.
red John enters here.
excuse me. Sorry.
he comes around here.
he waits for her, expecting her to come in alone.
only thing, her friend tannen chose the wrong night to come over for a Richard Gere and ice cream orgy.
so Red John zaps 'em both with his trusty stun gun, and...
excuse me.
grabs a 5-iron from the bag here and... Bam!
crushes Tannen's skull.
then he takes his sweet time dealing with Alison how he likes.
she's a nice big girl, so unless he's pretty strong,
I'm guessing that he grabbed her by the arms and...
today is the...
he says he's sorry for all the pain he's caused you and your mother.
5 years earlier
deeply sorry.
he asks you to forgive him.
can you do that, Jenny?
he needs to hear it.
I forgive you, daddy.
Oh, yes. - Daddy, I forgive you.
he's smiling now.
they're tears of joy.
he says, "god bless you and keep you.
he's gone.
amazing. Amazing. Amazing.
she's... amazed.
one second. - Give him some time.
Ab-absolu-- come on back to us.
I'm back. Thank you. - Back.
so, Patrick, I understand that you're also sort of a paranormal detective.
is that right?
I try to help the police when I can.
and--and you're helping them hunt this scary serial killer.
What--what's his name? Red John? - Red--Red John.
thar she blows-- classic Red John smiley face.
drawn in the victims' blood, clockwise with three fingers of his right hand,
wearing a rubber kitchen glove.
I'm stoked to finally see one in the flesh.
this isn't Red John.
right.
red John thinks of himself as a showman, an artist.
he has a strong sense of theater.
in all the previous killings,
he made sure that the first thing that anyone sees is the face on the wall.
you see the face first, and you know
you know what's happened, and you feel dread.
then and only then do you see the body of the victim
always in that order.
here it's the opposite.
the first thing you see is the body, and you have to look around to see the face on the wall.
doesn't play nearly as well, does it?
depends on your taste, I suppose.
no, come on. The killer could have painted on the correct wall here,
but he didn't because he didn't know better because he isn't Red John.
it's interesting.
you know what your problem is, my friend?
you enjoy your work a little too much.
you're a ghoul.
if you don't get horny reading "fangoria," I'm britney spears.
I-I resent that.
this is you trying to redeem yourself, is it?
I'm sorry.
he irks me.
he's irksome.
you don't need me here.
so, yeah, this one doesn't fit the pattern.
so Jane was right. We have a copycat.
or we have Red John trying new things, or we have Red John making a mistake.
we don't know.
we'll work the evidence until we do know.
go talk to the husband.
will do, boss.
what are you waitin' for?
so you might be right about this case. Might be. Thanks for the insight.
no. Did I say that?
I'm acknowledging the fact that you might be right, that's all.
I mean, if you wanted to come back, I couldn't stop you.
Yeah, fine. I'm asking you to come back.
because.
because you're useful to the team.
no. No, I won't say "please." Go screw yourself.
jackass.
good morning. - Can I help you?
you must be Van Pelt. Pleasure. Patrick jane.
Oh, hi. Good to meet you.
agent Cho said you had left town.
no. Nowhere to go.
okay.
do you want that desk over there or this one?
I mean, that one gets more light.
that one. More light by all means.
very pleasant addition to the serious crimes family.
when did you get here?
stop. I give up.
stop. Please, stop. - Hey, tag?
turn off the camera.
come on, come on, come on, that's enough. - Okay, we're done, we're done.
you are just awful! - Okay. Go, go, go.
stop, please. Stop!
I lost a beautiful, precious angel.
Yes, sir. Good-looking woman.
I'm jumping right in if you don't mind, Price.
you missed the tournament cut on friday, yes?
but you didn't come home until Sunday.
what did you do with the rest of your time in Fresno?
I get this. You--you guys can't catch the real killer,
so you wanna lay this one on me?
no, sir. If we have that confirmation of where you were,
it lets us exclude you from the investigation.
I was with a massage therapist.
name?
it had "lady" in there somewhere.
it'll be on his credit card bill.
there you go.
pleasure meeting you boys.
we're a full-service private practice.
we deliver primary care, uh, cosmetic surgery,
psychotherapy, sports medicine-- You name it.
what's the African connection?
it's what this place is all about.
half our profits go to build and staff basic health clinics in poor African communities.
Ah, here we are.
it's a thin file.
Alison was a healthy young woman.
psychiatric history?
she didn't have one.
S.T.D.S? Abortions? Unexplained injuries?
personality AND DEMANGE
no.
except for some routine checkups with me, it's all Dr. Tannen -- All aesthetic work.
did Tannen keep a diary?
our last case was solved because the victim kept a diary.
diary? I don't think so.
getting back to Alison Randolph...
how was her marriage, do you think?
happy? Unhappy?
about six months ago, Dr. Tannen asked my advice.
Alison had asked him to get her a year's supply of birth control pills off the books,
which is strictly against A.M.A. code.
I said sure, do it.
I mean, better us than some tijuana drugstore.
why the secrecy?
price Randolph had a vasectomy, april of '02.
if there's anything else I can do...
I appreciate that.
actually, there is.
I'm out of sleeping pills.
can you fix me up?
anything strong will do.
sure. Uh, come in for a consultation.
we'll squeeze you in this afternoon.
Oh, no. I-I was hoping to get something now.
trying to avoid the chitchat.
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't feel comfortable prescribing without some sort of "chitchat.
I understand. Uh, no problem.
I'll call you... maybe.
I like the husband for it.
he hires some hooker he knows to create an alibi, flies home,
fillets the spouse, flies back again.
the classic elaborate and clever but ultimately stupid plan.
have you looked at his PGA tournament record?
it's not bad. 6 mil career earnings.
Mm-hmm, for coming in second and third.
you put him on the 18th tee with a big one on the line,
like night follows day, he'll shank it.
he's a choker.
he doesn't have the nerve to kill his wife. Didn't do it.
are you suggesting we drop a prime suspect because he's never won a major?
Oh, no, no, no. I'm just making idle conversation.
how'd you do that?
telekinesis.
he blew on it.
that is another way to do it.
Mr. Jane, I have a question regarding your previous career path.
fire away.
when you met with other psychics -- real psychics
could they tell you were just pretending?
there's no such thing as real psychics.
I beg to differ.
my cousin Yolanda is a psychic.
your cousin is deluded or dishonest, or both.
steady.
no, no, he's entitled to his opinion.
he's wrong, though.
she has power. - Thank you.
she can communicate with the other side.
I've seen her do it myself.
she let you speak with someone that's gone.
Yes.
someone that you love and still miss very much.
Yes.
you wanted her power to be real, so it was.
no.
you're so sure you're right.
science don't know everything.
500 years ago, radio would've seemed like magic.
exactly.
500 years in the future, it could be totally normal to communicate with the other side.
the "other side.
your father's a football coach, yeah?
how'd you know that?
it's obvious from your whole demeanor.
my point is, didn't dad always say life is like football?
when that final whistle blows, the game is over. Done.
there is no more. There is no "other side.
this is it--lobster and bread rolls and nautical kitsch.
and then... nothingness.
you poor, sad man.
the kingdom of god is a real place.
okay, later tonight, when Rigsby asks you to come back to his hotel room...
say yes.
excuse me?
I know. You were planning on refusing him very curtly.
first week on the job, you wanna set a tone.
no monkey business. But why not?
Rigsby is an excellent lover, I'm sure.
tough but fair. Right?
right.
the kingdom of god is a real place, Mr. Jane, and you have an immortal soul.
Oh, I do so hope you're wrong.
good night.
good night. - later, dude.
this is... me.
welcome to the unit, agent Van Pelt.
thank you, agent Rigsby.
she explodes into action, reaching up to 60 miles per hour.
she easily outruns her terrifying prey.
GS, old friend.
it's been a while.
I hope you are keeping well.
I am thriving and happy.
I have 12 wives now and will soon being couriting number 13.
why can't you catch me?
you must feel so powerless and stupis and sad.
Oh, well. All the best. Red john.
that sounds like the real deal to me.
sounds like Red John. It's not.
red john wouldn't risk capture just to taunt me.
so the real killer's trying to throw us offtrack?
Cho, find out where Price Randolph was a half an hour ago.
Rigsby, I want you to check the hotel security cameras.
get those over to forensics.
you okay?
Absolutely.
get some sleep.
Hello? - Good morning.
you didn't sleep, did you?
I-I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. Wagner, please. It's urgent.
Jane. Patrick jane. Yeah, I'll hold.
forensics maybe got a break.
the blood on the cloth in the envelope is Alison Randolph's.
but they found a hair in there -- doesn't belong to her or Tannen.
guess who it does belong to.
it's yours, Tag. Amazing, huh?
science.
this is insane.
I didn't... I didn't kill Alison.
how do you explain your hair in the envelope?
either it was a mistake, or--or I'm being framed.
who would want to frame you?
we don't want to, if that's what you're thinking.
he and Alison were lovers.
who would want to frame you, Tag?
my brother.
why would he want to do that?
Alison and I were lovers.
I think you are psychic. You're just afraid to admit it.
so...
so...
why is it you can't sleep?
because I can't get the good pills without talking to a doctor.
and you don't like talking to doctors.
meh, you know, they always wanna be the smartest person in the room, don't they?
when in fact that's me, obviously.
you protect your core self very fiercely.
what do you think is the reason for that?
you know, this is exactly how I imagined it would be.
you gonna ask me about my mother?
do you want me to ask you about your mother?
I just wanna sleep.
so what is it that keeps you awake?
what's his name? Red John?
that's right. Red John.
uh, he's--he's killed at least eight women that we know of.
uh, the police asked me to try and get a psychic fix on him,
to see if I could get a sense of who this man is.
uh, how do you do that exactly, get a psychic fix on someone?
well, Davis, true demonic evil burns like fire.
it--it burns with a terrible cold, dark flame.
I force myself to look into that flame, and I see an image of the evildoer
in this case, Red John.
he's an ugly, tormented little man.
a lonely soul.
sad, very sad.
dear Mr. Jane, I do not like to be slandered in the media,
especially by a dirty money-grubbing fraud.
if you are a real psychic instead of a dishonest little worm,
you wouldn't need to open the door to see what I've done to your lovely wife and child.
Mr. Jane? Mr. Jane?
what is it that keeps you awake?
you know, when I was a boy, we had a farm.
it's a lot of work.
I was kind of a lazy kid. - Yes?
I'd always be trying to get my little brother Jimmy to do my chores for me.
one day, I promised him a dollar if he'd cut the firewood.
well...
he opened up an artery in his leg on the saw, and he bled to death...
died...
doing my chores for me.
you know...
that's almost exactly the same thing that happened to Johnny Cash.
is it really?
that's spooky.
Mr. Randolph, good --- cut the crap.
my brother's done nothing.
and you scumbags haven't got the stones to come after me, so you come after my family.
that is flat-out persecution. - Price, what did we agree?
Mr. Randolph, rest assured, there's no intent to persecute you.
we scumbags are holding your brother
because we have physical evidence linking him to the crime and potential motive in that
he states that whenever you weren't around, he was banging your wife like a big bass drum.
tag and Alison?
that's what he states, And he further states that it was you that killed Alison, - And you're now trying to frame him in revenge. - What'd you say?
Wh--bastard! You
son of a bitch! - You treated her like trash!
what did you expect?
I didn't expect my little brother to be banging my wife!
you little punk bastard!
everything you've told me is total fiction, isn't it?
Yes.
Why?
I can tell you're in real pain.
why not tell the truth?
the truth is mine.
I hear ya. - Thank you.
Yes.
remember, uh, we were talking about Tannen the other day,
and I asked you if he kept a diary, and you said he did?
well, there's no diary among his effects. - No.
I'm sorry, no?
no. You have it wrong. I-I didn't think he kept a diary.
strange.
then it must have been someone else who told me.
either that or I'm going mad.
but I definitely, 100% remember hearing that Tannen kept a diary.
well, that is strange, but why does it matter if he kept a diary?
you're right. It doesn't matter.
only I was thinking, why do magicians have beautiful girl assistants?
Why?
because they're reliable distracters of attention.
people will look at a beautiful girl for a long time
before they look where they should be looking if they wanna see how the trick really works.
anyhow, I'll send over a couple of forensics guys tomorrow to search his office and locate that diary.
mm, didn't they already search his office?
Oh, they never do it thoroughly the first time.
once more for luck, eh? It's gotta be there somewhere.
thanks for everything, doc.
good night. - Good night.
lost something?
how did you get in?
door was open.
I think I left my phone in your office.
the door wasn't open.
must have been. Here I am.
what are you doing?
I confess, the temptation to play detective was a little too strong. I...
I was looking for that diary.
I got a little carried away.
no kidding.
no diary?
no diary.
maybe I should have a gander.
I'm good at finding things.
be my guest.
Eureka.
Dr. Wagner, thanks for your help.
Mr. Jane.
uh, your phone.
right.
Thanks.
uh, yeah. Got it.
silly of me.
well, good-bye again. - Wait.
give me the diary.
it's very amusing.
I try.
I knew.
I knew it might be a trick, but I...
I had to be sure.
Yes. That's how the trick works.
what led you to me?
not that i'm saying I did it. I'm just asking.
when we first met, you said you didn't know who Red John was,
but you have books on criminal psychiatry--there
that have chapters on him.
you're the Randolph family doctor, so you could easily get a strand of Tag's hair,
and, being a doctor, you could hack up another human without difficulty.
it's obvious it was you.
that's it?
you have nothing.
that's just guesswork.
Oh, I know.
I just wanted to be sure I had the right answer.
I was surprised. I gotta be honest.
you don't seem to be a wicked man.
but you are.
you're angry about the letter.
Yeah, it was a bit mean-spirited.
for the record, I'm sorry about your family.
I can only imagine your pain.
I'm not... a wicked man.
my conscience is clear.
Really?
right now in Africa, there's 3, 000 beautiful children alive today
who should be dead, but they aren't because of me.
Tannen was gonna ruin me and destroy all that work...
over nothing. Money.
theft, he called it.
embezzlement.
self-righteous idiot.
it's simple math.
if I go to jail, thousands of kids will die.
so I made a rational, moral decision to kill tannen...
for the greater good.
and Alison? What did she do wrong?
as you said, she was the magician's assistant, just a distraction.
if only Tannen died, the police would've been all over this place, wouldn't they?
truly, is killing two any worse than killing one, when so many lives are at stake?
I don't think so.
you poor, sad man. You're under arrest.
let's go. - I'm pointing a gun at you.
you really think I would set you up so nicely and let you pull a loaded gun on me?
I took the bullets out earlier.
you're late! - What?
draw your weapon!
drop the gun!
hands on your head.
get down on your knees. Down.
closed case doughnuts are here.
I just went to get sleeping pills, I swear to god.
I-I didn't even wanna go.
you know I didn't want to go. - Right.
Yeah, you didn't set Wagner up...
didn't figure it was him days ago.
you didn't let us tear apart the victim's family simply to satisfy your childish need for drama.
meh, that family was screwed anyway.
don't blame yourselves, guys.
don't even start.
I'm still angry.
I'm sorry. - No, you're not.
a frog? Well, this makes everything better, doesn't it?
what's the fuss?
slept through Lisbon's briefing in the van, didn't you?
like a baby. - Yeah, the victim's name is Kristin Marley.
she worked at the state capitol for some lady senator, went missing three days ago.
rumor is she was having an affair with the senator's husband.
my bet--she's a jumper. - I hope not.
if she's a jumper, job's done.
Yeah, the senator's husband dumps her, she wants to make him feel bad, she comes out here...
splat. - Don't talk that way.
okay, not splat. Bam.
there's nothing worse than suicide.
human life is sacred. When someone takes their own life, it's a tragedy.
Sacramento P. D.'S handing the case over to us.
let's go talk to the coroner.
shall I recap the case, sleepyhead?
Kristin Marley-- lady senator's aide, rumored romance with the senator's husband.
very good.
Oh, I trained myself to hear and take in information while asleep.
the others told you? - Yes, they did.
at this point, there's no way to determine what happened to the victim, agent Lisbon.
I-I simply can't help you.
well, can you tell how long she's been dead?
I couldn't possibly, given the evidence available.
well, do you think it was a homicide or a suicide?
couldn't say. - What's your guess?
I'm not in the habit of--of guessing.
please don't touch the decedent.
you--you--you detectives always want the instant answers.
what I do is science. Science will uncover the truth, but she will be precise, methodical and take her time before she renders her decision.
I wonder if science can remove the stick from his butt.
I heard that. - You're right. We want facts.
fortunately, we have them.
Oh, we do? - In abundance.
you're the consultant that pretends to read minds, aren't you?
no. I don't pretend to read minds. I do read minds.
but don't we all? Look at lisbon. You can see what she's thinking.
no kidding.
and I can see what you're thinking right now.
uh, I-I was thinking that you, sir, are a bumptious fool, and I was wondering exactly what training in forensic pathology you have.
Ah, but right before that, you were wondering whether you would choose Lisbon or Van Pelt as your concubine in that little fantasy kingdom you like to go to sometimes.
I... I do not.
Oh, and--and you're right. I-I know nothing of forensic pathology.
but agent Van Pelt-- she might offer her theory.
or I might not. - Look at her feet.
I did. - And what question presents itself?
Where's her other shoe? - Exactly.
it wasn't up on the bridge. It could be in her car.
even if it was, why would she walk to the middle of the bridge with one shoe on?
why would she do that? - Bingo!
there's no need to be patronizing.
so she must have been carried.
she didn't kill herself. She was murdered, then dropped over.
or thrown over still alive.
better than suicide. - It's...
a theory.
it's lovely to meet you, doc. You're a horse's ass, but you mean well.
I'll be in the van.
my apologies, sir. Cho, tell the sacramento p. D. That it's a homicide.
Rigsby, Van Pelt, see what the sheriff's department got in their investigation.
all right.
Kristin had been interning here for about nine months.
she came in at the start of the last session, right out of college.
I liked her. She was sweet, young--in a good way.
who did she work for?
senator melinda batson.
she's an up-and-comer from the central valley.
please put that down.
anything to the rumor that Kristin was having an affair with Batson's husband?
elliott Batson-- he's melinda's chief of staff.
we've heard the rumors. Everyone denies it.
there's no evidence anything happened.
the media seem to think there is.
you want to get me started on what they believe?
frankly, when you've worked here as long as i have, you hear a lot of stories about wild behavior.
most of them aren't true. - Except the ones that are.
sorry.
Hello? - Hello? Hello? Hello?
I've issued a statement, and I'm not taking any questions.
we're not press. We're CBI.
agent Teresa Lisbon, Patrick Jane.
right. Sorry. You called.
this is my husband Elliott.
tough day around here.
is this Kristin's desk? - Yes.
come inside.
Jane. Care to join us? - I'll be right there.
anything unusual about Kristin's behavior the day she disappeared?
no, she was, uh, cheerful.
finished work, left at 6: 00, I think, uh...
a little after 6: 00. - after 6: 00 then.
did she say where she was going?
no. - No.
She...was having trouble with her family.
it was her stepmother, right?
her natural parents are dead, and for some reason, her stepmother called a bunch of times that day.
did kristin tell you what it was about?
no. - No.
no. I-I was surprised. I-I thought they were estranged.
what was your relationship to Kristin, Mr. Batson?
Oh, please. Please. We know where you're going with this.
Melinda, I-- - no, let's just haul the trash out in the open.
you want to know if she and elliott were sleeping together.
were you? - Never. It's a rumor. That's all.
rumors usually happen for a reason.
well... - I'll give you the reason-- politics.
you want to take a female politician down a few notches?
throw mud on her marriage.
where were you the night Kristin was killed?
here. I was on a conference call with a trade delegation from Taiwan.
we talked until after 11: 00.
I was with him the whole time.
we'll be married three years this october, and...
today's news excepted, uh, we've never been happier.
that's hard to believe.
what does that mean?
well, there's nothing going on between you right now.
excuse me? What?
I'm sorry. I-I meant sexually, no heat. Right?
I think we're done here.
you'd think a politician would have thicker skin.
you accused them of lying about their sex life, and you're surprised they're upset?
Oh, come on. You're buying that happy talk? Really?
agent Minelli, sir. - Agent Lisbon.
I asked him down. Uh, Walter Crew, Melinda Batson's dad.
you're agents, uh, Jane and Lisbon?
Yeah, we are.
sorry to track you down like this.
I asked Virgil here to introduce me to the team handling the poor Marley girl's case.
Walter has been a friend of the CBI for some time.
he was an extremely influential legislator for what, 20 years?
26, but who's counting?
anyway, I'm old news now.
the only thing I lobby for is a good tee time.
why the interest in the poor Marley girl's case?
interest? I liked her.
Yeah, met her in Melinda's office.
she was good people, came from a tough background-- didn't let that stop her.
I know how difficult it is to get straight answers from the people in that building there.
if you have any problems, you just let me know.
I can still knock heads.
Oh, we'll be fine. - Just let me know.
take care. - Sir.
I hate walks, Lisbon. I know they're healthy. I don't care.
put me in a chair, I'm a happy man.
but when Walter Crew asked me to stroll with him down to the capitol, I say,"of course, Walter." you get my drift?
I do.
step carefully. I want daily reports.
Oh, and, uh, how did the batson interview go?
Oh, that was very exciting. - What did he do?
nothing that can't be repaired.
Teresa, nice of you to drop by.
I know I'm late. I'm sorry.
late" is an interesting word in this context.
you were supposed to be here 42 minutes ago.
I know. The point is, I'm here now.
we're supposed to talk, so let's talk.
I have another patient scheduled in eight minutes.
I can talk fast.
this is the third time you've been late.
what can I say? Lot of people getting killed.
can I get a coffee?
do you know why counseling is mandatory for CBI agents who've been involved in a shooting?
because nobody would come if it was voluntary?
and that's what it remains mandatory until I sign and file this form.
see you next week.
this is unnecessary. I'm fine. I'm not traumatized.
a man pointed a gun at you, a man who intended to kill you.
fortunately, Jane shot him first. - It doesn't matter.
you went from thinking you were going to be killed to watching a man die
two of the most wrenching experiences we can have-- and you went through them in seconds.
you don't think that affected you? - No.
you really want to keep seeing me, don't you?
next week, on time.
fine.
there's a stain on the ceiling that looks like elvis, but today, it looks more like a basset hound.
someone call the media. It's a miracle.
or maybe someone's moved my couch. Cho?
did you move my couch? - No. Why would I?
excuse me?
did you move the couch?
I had to, uh, change a light. Problem?
no, no, no. Can you help me move it back, please?
I got a thing I... Thanks. Just up there.
I think it's this way.
just a little.
that's it. Let me just try to...
perfect. Thank you. Elvis is back.
anything on the stepmom?
her name's Charlotte Mcadoo.
she called Kristin 11 times in the two days before she disappeared.
any idea what that was about?
no, but her son Harlan had been picked up on a carjacking charge.
he posted bail the day Kristin disappeared, claimed he had nothing to do with the carjacking, said he was with Kristin when it happened.
he used Kristin as his alibi?
how bad's Harlan?
well, mostly car theft, some assault.
what did Charlotte have to say about that?
she won't answer her phone, won't call back.
we're heading out to talk to her.
shouldn't we be looking for Kristin's lover? - Who?
elliott Batson's alibi checked out, and there's no sign she was seeing someone else.
we've checked. - Well, not enough.
she was an immature romantic looking for escape and adventure.
she was having an affair.
we searched her place thoroughly.
she kept the affair well-hidden. - Well, of course.
it's an adventure because it's a secret.
but I expect she'll tell us who it was.
I'll bite. How?
check this out.
she was a collector.
she kept sand from every beach she ever went to.
she would have kept a memento of her lover, something small
I bet she kept it in a fancy jewelry box, the kind with a figurine on the lid.
there was a fancy jewelry box like that in her bedroom-- a ballerina.
Ballerina--she's the type.
but we checked it. There's nothing in it but cheap jewelry.
did you check in the secret compartment? - The...
the secret compartment either on the bottom or one of the sides. They usually have one.
it's worth taking a look. - Fine.
forget about Bosco.
he's got something.
Yeah, he's got red john, and we don't.
no. No, he's got something new on the case--new evidence.
how can you tell?
it's clear as can be. I'll be right back.
Jane, red john belongs to Bosco now.
I don't like it either, but you're gonna have to deal with it.
do you want a coffee? I'm gonna bring you a coffee.
I need copies of each of these sent over to division.
what's he doing in there?
he said you told him to wait in there.
we'll finish later.
get away from my desk. - Where'd you go?
I've been here almost half an hour.
and stop hacking my passcodes and stop hustling my people.
it's not doing you any good, you know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What'd you get on red john?
and what makes you think I got anything?
the folder-- you moved it when you saw me, protected it.
it's the one thing you'd protect from me.
it's the cover-up that gave you away. What is it?
it's none of your business, so go.
you need to understand something.
red john doesn't make mistakes. He doesn't leave clues.
if you have new evidence, it's because he wants you to have it.
the question isn't "what does it mean?
it's "why did he give it to you?
that's deep. - Tell me what it is. I can help you.
have you ever seen a crack addict when they're begging for a hit?
you got that same look in your eye that they get.
you've got me all figured out.
Hey, Van Pelt. Did you get it?
there's a secret compartment, just like you said.
and what was in it? - Nothing.
it's empty.
all right.
bad news, huh? - No, not at all.
it's like you said--it's the cover-up that gave you away.
you're an addict, Jane. You need help.
you're making a mistake. - You can go.
so I got tickets to the kings game tomorrow night. You want to go?
I'm going out. - Who with?
the niece of the shopkeeper we met on that red john thing.
Oh, finally. It took you long enough.
5-b? - Yeah.
Yeah, we talked on the phone. She's nice. We'll see how it goes.
Oh, I expect a full report.
in your dreams.
Hey, I got you that number. You owe me.
no.
Charlotte Mcadoo? - Yeah.
we need to talk to you about your stepdaughter, Kristin Marley.
you know that Kristin's dead, right, Charlotte?
what about it?
I guess you're pretty broken up.
she wasn't my kid. I'm not the huggy type. Sue me.
if you didn't like Kristin, why'd you make all those calls right before she disappeared?
don't remember.
it was a week ago.
I'm old. My memory's bad.
did it have something to do with your son Harlan?
what about Harlan?
he used Kristin as an alibi when he was arrested, but Kristin told sacramento P. D.She hadn't seen Harlan for months.
were you asking kristin to change her story and lie an alibi for her stepbrother?
no, that's crazy. - Where is Harlan?
I don't know. I haven't seen him for days.
okay. Thanks for your time.
that's... That's it? - We'll see ourselves out. Thank you.
you think Charlotte smokes filtered and unfiltered?
not if she's got a visitor. Bathroom or closet?
bathroom. - I think closet. You want to bet?
what do I get if i win? - I pay for lunch next week.
I win, you tell me about your date.
that's enough time.
Hey, Harlan. - Oh, crap.
Harlan, were you in the bathroom or the closet?
closet. Wh-- - told ya.
we didn't bet. - Yes, we did.
no law against being in a closet.
no, Harlan, but it is kinda suspicious.
you got no right to hold me.
we're just talking.
all right, what do you want to talk about?
Kristin Marley-- when did you see her last?
what happened to her? - You tell us.
I got nothing to say about her.
you must be mad that she didn't back your alibi on the carjacking charge, huh?
first of all, that arrest was completely bogus.
and "b," that stuck-up bitch don't get what the word "family" means, so...
what is that?
family's supposed to help when you're down.
but she gets a job in the capitol with some big money friends, and pow
she's too good for the people she grew up with.
she don't get what the word "family" is all about, you know?
didn't. She's dead.
Yeah. That's too bad.
did you have any contact with kristin after you posted bail, Harlan? - No.
none? - That's what I said.
it's funny, because our tech guys have been going through her cell phone.
there's some deleted texts on it.
four of them were from you the day she disappeared.
no. That's what you call a-a glitch--computer thing.
you were threatening Kristin to get her to lie for you, right?
didn't say that. - I could see why you'd do it.
you're facing serious time.
you arresting me?
you got no right to hold me if you ain't.
you're not under arrest, but you are out on bail, and that can be revoked if the judge thinks you're not being cooperative.
do you want a soda, Harlan?
I want chips.
if he took Kristin's body to the bridge, he put her in his trunk.
it's worth taking a look. I'll call the district attorney.
if Harlan hears we're looking at his car, he'll be out the door before the warrant comes through.
we're gonna make him want to stay. Van Pelt.
you're taking over the Mcadoo interview.
I'm totally ready for that. I can get him to confess to this.
Yeah, maybe.
the main thing is, you keep him in there long enough for us to search his car.
be friendly. He thinks he's a player. He'll eat it up.
what do you mean, be friendly? - Need a map?
good luck.
I heard bosco cleaned your clock this morning.
Oh, that's one interpretation.
I get it. It's tough to have red john taken away like that.
bet you'd give a lot to know what they're saying in Bosco's office.
Yeah. Yeah, I would.
you gotta let it go, man.
forget about the jewelry box. You missed one. So what?
actually, I didn't. I'm pursuing an independent line of investigation, gonna crack this case in 24 hours.
I think we might be ahead of you this time.
Hi, Harlan. I'm agent Van Pelt.
special agent Lisbon asked me to take over the interview.
Why? - She's busy...with something else.
so I've looked through your file, and it's, uh, it's very...
what? - Well...
I don't think you had anything to do with this crime.
thank you. That's what I've been saying.
it's just a big misunderstanding, I'm sure.
Yeah. You got that right.
but let's fill out the forms so everyone's happy, okay?
chips.
so let's make a time line of everywhere you've been since Kristin disappeared.
okay.
you want another?
these all pictures of your daughter?
Yes, they are.
Oh, it's surprising there's not more pictures of you, given your standing, that is.
what, me talking to a bunch of famous windbags?
had those, took them down. Waste of space.
thank you. - No, my days are over.
Melinda has got the future.
she could go far, very far, if she listens to me.
now what did you want to talk about?
how long were you sleeping with Kristin Marley before she was killed?
what makes you think I was?
you're a politician-- ambitious, narcissistic, addicted to the love of strangers.
she was beautiful, impressionable, no doubt flattered by your attentions.
and you're not the sort of man to deny yourself an object of desire.
I'm married 38 years, Mr. Jane.
as I said.
uh, even if what you say is true-- and I'm not saying it is
what does that have to do with poor Kristin's murder?
blackmail or something like it.
the business adultery leads to.
but even if I am what you say I am
and I'm not saying I am
wouldn't I have faced a situation like this before and handled it without killing anybody?
it's a good point. I'll think about that.
please.
anything else? - What? Sorry?
well, whoever it is, I'll have the killer by the morning, so, uh, you should act accordingly.
thank you for your time.
you think Harlan ever cleans out his car?
so where you taking the shopkeeper's niece for dinner?
I'd rather not talk about it. - Why not?
it's private. - Oh, come on.
let's talk about something else.
I'll call technical services. They can pop that lock in 20 seconds.
it'll take them 2 hours to get here.
it took you two hours to open the door last time you tried this, and we had to pay for the busted window.
fluke.
if I had a date, I'd tell you about it. - Yeah.
I would, tell you anything you wanted to know.
okay, you ever gonna man up and make a move on Van Pelt?
fine. Don't tell me. - Right.
check this out. Wasn't the other one of these on Kristin Marley's foot?
I'll call Lisbon.
Kristin's shoe was in your trunk.
no. No way.
you want to tell us how it got there, Harlan?
I don't know. Maybe you put it there, huh?
you have no alibi for the night of Kristin's disappearance.
I told you. I was with my mom.
she was concealing you when we went to pick you up.
it's not gonna cut it. - You were mad at Kristin.
a little, but-- - you threatened her.
no.
okay, I mean, a-a little, but come on. I-I wouldn't hurt her for real.
that's not much of a story, Harlan.
I thought you believed me. - You were wrong.
you know what? The hell with this. I'm outta here.
not quite yet.
Oh, you're gonna stop me? - Yeah.
did you make the arrest? - I did.
Ah, victory is yours. - Yes, it is.
what? - Oh, nothing.
come on. - No. No.
I'm still waiting.
throwing the body off the bridge was a smart move
good chance the coroner would declare it a suicide.
do you really think Harlan Mcadoo would come up with that?
dumb people can come up with smart ideas, and smart people can come up with dumb ones.
eh, true.
I'll have the real killer here in 12 hours or so.
what are you talking about? - You'll see. Bye.
Hey, boss, you want me to send Mcadoo down to be arraigned?
not yet. Sit on him. See if he comes up with something useful once he calms down.
obviously, you've got to get it out of committee before--Mr. Jane?
don't mind me.
what are you doing?
hard at work, on the case.
I don't understand. We got a call from agent minelli saying that an arrest had been made--Kristin's stepbrother.
Nope, nope, nope. Wrong guy.
how can that be?
simple miscarriage of justice, happens all the time.
what does that mean?
it means I have to find the real killer.
the real killer? How?
Oh, Kristin was a collector.
ergo, the identity of Kristin's killer will be in her things.
how can you be sure it's there?
Oh, I'm sure.
Mr. Jane, this isn't acceptable. First you accost my father
Oh, I wouldn't use the word "accost.
now you're ransacking my office.
calm down, Melinda. - I won't calm down. I thought we put this behind us.
not much of a campaign slogan
Batson--so tough on crime, she puts the innocent behind bars.
do what you have to do. Uh, we'll help in any way we can.
great. Thank you. There's a couple of boxes right there, if you could just, uh, grab one each and follow me to my car.
Lisbon, didn't you arrest mcadoo? - Yeah, we did.
D. A.Says you haven't sent him down to be arraigned.
we have 48 hours to do that. We still have some loose ends.
What--what loose ends? Him? - No.
what are you doing? No, don't tell me.
I want this off my desk.
get Mcadoo to the D. A.Tonight.
how hard is Crew leaning on you? - He's not.
then who's doing it for him? - No one.
is this my case, sir? - Yes, but
then it's my decision as to when the suspect is handed over to the district attorney, right?
if Mcadoo isn't in the D. A.'S office first thing tomorrow morning, this becomes a different conversation.
you won't regret this. - I already do.
Hey, this is Lisbon. Leave a message. I'll call you back.
I found what I was looking for. I don't want to risk taking it out of the office, so I'm gonna put it in the top right-hand drawer of your desk.
when you get this, call me.
ah ha"?
you--you startled me. I'll...
I'll just get out of your way.
stand still. Turn around.
what is this?
who are you and who are you working for?
I work for the building. I clean. I clean.
Oh, you're not a cleaner. Look at this place. It's a mess.
you're the fixer.
you've been listening in on our conversations.
what's that? That's one of the bugs you placed.
I found it in the overhead light.
when I told Van Pelt to go and check out the jewelry box, you overheard and you went there first.
and it was you that placed the shoe in Mcadoo's trunk.
I'm on the cleaning crew.
Oh, really? - I'm new. You can call my supervisor.
Marty, uh, marty, uh, toretta, huh?
call him up right now. - No.
wake him up.
I got no idea what you're talking about here.
we're talking about accessory to murder, conspiracy, obstruction.
who hired you?
murder? Oh, I-I don't feel too good.
can I sit--can I-- - Oh, take a seat.
Thanks.
all right. No, no, no. Calm.
are you calm? - Sure.
all right, now I want you to lift your gun out with two fingers and slide it across the floor.
now get your cuffs.
this isn't gonna work.
the door-- hook yourself up.
toss the keys.
now you and I are gonna walk out here. - Sure.
it's a little stroll.
find out where he goes.
Oh, no, I think-- - Go, now! Go!
keys, please. There. Yeah.
so, agent Lisbon, here we are.
what's this about?
this is Art Cavalleri.
he's the private investigator one of you hired to wiretap and obstruct our investigation.
Really?
he's agreed to talk in exchange for leniency.
I called you down here to offer you the same deal.
well, that's very nice of you.
you can discuss it with my attorney. Melinda?
I have nothing to say.
even if you had nothing to do with Kristin Marley's murder, with what Cavalleri is saying about the conspiracy and the cover-up, you're all gonna do a lot of time in prison.
I don't need to hear any more. - W-wait. I-I do.
what kind of leniency are we talking about here?
Elliott. - Depends, Mr. Batson. What do you know?
I need an assurance that any charges related to the murder will be dropped.
got it, as long as you didn't have anything to do with the murder.
if you'll excuse us, I want some private time with my family right now.
Mr. Crew, stay there. Go on.
Oh, come on. Spit it out, man. The marriage is a sham. She's gay. You're the beard.
it was kind of obvious from the start.
I had an arrangement with Melinda. - Elliott, don't.
I agreed to marry Melinda in exchange for...
certain financial considerations.
batson, we had a deal.
did that deal include time in prison? I don't think so.
so it was your own people that started the rumor about you and Kristin
to hide her affair with Melinda. - Yes.
I'm sorry, Melinda.
Kristin broke it off shortly before she disappeared.
Melinda was upset.
and were you with Melinda the night Kristin disappeared?
no. I didn't see her until late that night.
she was...a mess.
but she wouldn't tell me what had happened.
Kristin had something hidden in her apartment-- a memento, i guess.
lovers' memento.
cavalleri had found it, but we took it out of his car.
it could be a "w," but I think it's an "m.
you and your father were both having an affair with Kristin.
no.
no. I-- - Melinda.
I had a relationship with Kristin.
he seduced her...took her...
the way he's taken women his whole life.
I was trying to make a point.
you were what?
I was trying to show you-- - what?
she was just another girl, that she was just another trashy little girl.
you thought you were in love, but she was just having a fling.
he believed that you were giving away a very bright political career because of some strumpet.
what happened that night?
Melinda, every day you don't talk is another day you're on the news.
I knew Kristin was seeing someone, but i didn't know who it was.
so I followed her...
and that's when I saw my father.
after he left, I went into her apartment.
she had these stone bookends.
I grabbed one.
next thing i knew, Kristin was on the floor.
it just... Happened.
and then I did what I always do when I'm in trouble.
I called daddy.
he said he knew someone who could fix it.
Ah, the fixer.
you can let cavalleri go now. Watch.
Oh, my god.
he's dead.
Yeah.
you abused a corpse to get a confession.
used. Used a corpse. There's no "ab.
I'm appalled. I'm...
I don't know what to say.
sir, it's not like we killed him.
his neck was broken in the crash.
we got a confession. - Suppose you didn't.
suppose you'd been wrong.
have you any idea of the vastness of the crap storm that would follow?
it would blot out the sun.
sir, Crew and Batson manipulated us into arresting the wrong person.
they bugged our offices and subverted our case.
I don't think we did anything wrong.
I think we should be commended.
Congratulations. You finally got her to drink the kool-aid.
check yourself, agent.
all of you.
well, I thought that went pretty well.
great, yeah.
highlight for me was definitely your speech
passionate, articulate, strong.
whatever.
Hey, good work with Mcadoo, you know, keeping him here.
Yeah.
you know, if boss had given me a chance, I think I could have gotten him to confess.
sure, if he wasn't, you know, innocent.
if it wasn't for that small fact, I'm sure you'd have taken him to town.
Thanks.
you have any plans for tonight?
home, tv.
well... Have fun. - You, too.
you're gonna die alone.
sir? - Morning.
Yeah. Sir, you can't go in there. - No, it's okay. I come in peace.
great color on you.
go away. - Just give me a minute, please.
I-I want you, and I want your team to know that I got it.
I got the message. I got it.
the red john case...belongs to you.
you're gonna leave us alone?
Yeah, that's right.
I don't believe that.
I brought you doughnuts-- the international law enforcement symbol of friendship.
I am trusting you to catch red john.
I'm counting on it.
we will catch him. Thanks.
good hunting.
Hicks, take that away. Take it far away. Take it out of the building.
God know what he put in there. - You got it.
all right, let's go over the most recent forensics.
there are two short, linear incised wounds that are extremely superficial.
they involve the anterior surface of the right wrist, which measures 0. 8 inches.
okay, you got it. Don't tell the locals what it's for.
Yeah, no worries.
just say you're following up on something.
I want to keep this on the down low for now.
now what else did you get from handwriting analysis?
we've had two guys look at it-- one local, one from D. C. and of course they agree on pretty much nothing.
figures.
what did the D. C.Guy say?
so we got kirby hine 29-year-old local boy, welder.
that's pretty much all we got.
local p. D.Has stomped all over the crime scene, so I don't think forensics will be any use.
it's like they don't even watch tv. Every toddler knows this stuff.
Hey, lisbon. How you doing? - Hey, pat. Ngngime.
what's the deal?
uh, T.O. D.Looks to be yesterday afternoon, give or take.
your standard blunt-force trauma to the back of the head
maybe one strike followed by a couple of real widow makers.
length of wood, I'm guessing. - What's that on his face? Is that glitter?
Yep. Riding that disco farm boy tip.
his family's here.
gonna get ugly, I expect.
I'll see you later.
rigs, van pelt, wo the b by. Cho.
interesting.
I feel like jane knows about us.
no, he doesn't. How would he know?
I know we've been cool. It's just it feels like he knows.
you're being paranoid.
just because I'm being paranoid doesn't mean that jane doesn't know.
don't tell me you didn't kill him, ted.
that poor boy lying there-- he's just fool enough to marry your daughter.
you're goin' down. You're dead.
bring it right ahead, Dooley! Here I stand.
that's enough. That's enough.
you step out of my road, girlie.
here I am, Dooley! - Back off, man!
we're grieving, you clown! Why don't you back up?
yeah? You make me, pissant.
nicely done. - You're under arrest.
let's go.
sir, let me get this straight.
the victim's wife is donna hines, and it was her brother rod gerber that told you to step back.
is that right?
my name is theodore luscom.
I am a citizen of free california.
the so-called federal and state authorities you work for are not legitimate.
therefore, I do not recognize your right to arrest or question me.
Oh, please.
you don't know it, but you people are just tools of the united nations.
Oh, yeah, we know . they told us last june, laid it all out.
say what? - There was a change of policy.
had a big secretive meeting, told us exactly who we're working for.
that, my friend, was an eye-opener, I tell you.
are you mocking me? - Oh, I'm serious.
they told us... The whole grand plan.
hush. Ignore him, mr. Luscom.
good stuff.
just ignore me.
Lisbon? - Hey,Bos. What's up?
you're not gonna like what I'm about to do, but you're gonna have to deal with it.
what? - Hey, Bosco.
Hi, jane. You're under arrest.
it's a microphone transmitter located during an electronic sweep of our offices.
that is a dedicated receiver to the unit which I found in jane's desk.
is this true, Jane? You were spying on bosco and his team?
"spying" is such an ugly word.
more just keeping a friendly eye on things.
did you know about this? - Of course not. I would have never allowed this.
she would never.
you understand this is a serious criminal offense? - Come on.
eavesdropping is a felony under section 632 of the penal code, punishable by up to one year in prison.
how could you be so stupid?
Heheas t t red John case. He won't keep me informed.
so I have to keep myself informed. I was low-key about it.
I could have turned one of his agents or used blackmail or bribery. I didn't.
well, thanks for your restraint.
we can resolve this easily. It's your choice.
how's that?
if jane resigns immediately and agrees to never return to the CBI, - I will ask the a. G.Not to file charges. - Boss.
you know Bosco has the right of it.
nothing ian d d nothing I want to do, frankly. He crossed a line.
what's it gonna be, jane?
charge me. I'll see you in court.
I'm not gonna leave the CBI just 'cause you tell me to.
if I charge you, you'll go to jail now--today
and you can't apply for bail till tuesday.
so that's three days and nights in jail.
it's a new experience. I welcome it.
don't be stupid. This is serious.
come on, sam. You really want to do this?
I just did. Malloy!
he's ready to go.
open two.
Hey, guys.
Hey, pete. Did you see any vermin out in the corridor there?
vermin? - Mice.
nuh-unh. - See? Told you. You're paranoid, man.
I know what I saw. I know what I saw.
the arresting officer advises protective custody.
are you a cop or a child rapist? - Neither.
what do you need protective custody for, then?
well, I guess I don't.
your funeral.
stop.
open up number eight.
nice to meet you.
what you in for?
Oh, me? Uh, eavesdropping on a state agent.
you?
they say I raped and murdered a guy, stabbed him to death.
but it's not true. - Oh, that's good.
we had consensual sex. Then I stabbed him to death.
okay. - You get the top bunk.
I like the top bunk.
I know. I-I know. It's sad and it's stupid, but Jane was bound to self-destruct eventually.
we all knew that. - But, boss, come on. There must be something
let's get back to the case, shall we?
is that the book we found on the victim?
Yeah, Kirby wouldn't win any penmanship awards. It's mostly illegible.
lots of numbers. Times, maybe?
map coordinates. Bible citations.
there's a few names I can make out--Jay, Martin.
and then on this page...
"vultures!!!"?
somebody's preying on him, waiting for him to die?
preying on him for what, though? He wasn't a rich man.
Cho, get to work on Ted Luscom.
van Pelt and I are gonna go talk to Kirby's family in the morning.
Rigsby, get on the Hineses. - Okay, you got it.
so, Ted, tell us about your beef with Kirby Hines and the Gerbers.
I get to call you by your first name, too?
if you like. I'm Kimball.
ain't you smooth and easygoing?
that 10 acres where Kirby died-- that was my grandfather's land.
20 years back, my father's brother Roy stole it from us rightful progeny and fraudulently sold it to the Gerbers, who knew.
the Gerbers knew he stole it.
and how much is 10 acres of land worth around there?
Oh, hell, man. It ain't the land. It's what's under it-- oil sands.
it used to be worthless. Cost too much to pump out.
but with the price of oil sky-high, oil sands are worth workin'.
we're talking $50 million, $60 million to the landowners.
so you took the gerbers to court.
yeah... Last year.
and what do you think happened? - You got nothing.
zero.
I knew I shouldn't have wasted my time, but the deceit and dishonesty has made me mad.
where were you yesterday, Ted?
well, I was several places, Kimball.
we're gonna need a list. - "we"?
I only see one of you.
I and the state machinery oppression's gonna need a list.
well, I will think it over.
some people just don't have that facility.
I'm sure your father loved you in his way.
he just didn't have the tools to express that love.
you know what, man? I really appreciate you listening to me, man.
please, boo. What are cellmates for?
so listen. - Listening.
about the, uh, unfortunate situation with jane,
I want you to know that my beef is only with him.
I got no problem with you or your people.
it was a big mistake bringing in a whack job like him, but that's in the past now.
you and me...
you and me always had a good working relationship, and I hope that can continue.
okay. I listened.
so we're cool?
you did what you thought was right.
I need to think about it before I know whether we're cool.
okay. Okay, fair enough.
good night, Jane.
good night, pal.
and don't worry about tomorrow morning.
why would I need to worry about tomorrow morning?
there are some scary people here.
they all know you're a cop.
how would they know that? I'm not--I'm not really a cop.
well, then you'll be fine.
besides, they got real excellent medical facilities here.
grace? - Sorry.
is something wrong?
no. I was--I was thinking about Jane. I hope he's all right.
he'll be fine. Maybe he'll learn something.
are you Gail? - Yes.
is your mom here? - Yes.
are you from the police? - Yes, we are.
can you take us to your mom?
are you gonna bring my daddy home?
no, sweetie, I'm sorry. We can't do that.
good morning, everybody. - Morning, pig.
thank you for raising that issue. Let me address that.
you believe me to be a policeman of some kind. That is not true.
I am not a policeman, nor have I ever been one.
I do work with the police.
I use my skills to catch murderers, though rarely do I deal with professnana such as yourselves.
what skills?
people skills.
you show me your skills, little brother.
you... You...
are the shot-caller in here.
you come from the bay area. You like to sniff some kind of glue or solvent to get high.
you wish you could quit, because you think it makes you look weak in front of your peers.
is that right? - Yes, but you needn't worry, because the way you are when you get hig makes everybody even more scared of you, right?
hell yeah, man. - Yeah.
I don't think I like you much.
if you stop seeing the world in terms of what you like and what you dislike and saw things for what they truly are in themselves, you would find a great deal more peace in your life.
and I can help you with that if you want.
think about it. Where's the phone in here? I need to make a call.
over there. - Thanks.
this is nice. Thank you.
did you make these? - We both did.
we're keeping ourselves busy.
delicious.
your show's in the vcr, baby, if you want to watch it a while.
okay.
we're sorry for your loss, Donna.
it's hard. It's hard.
just when things were getting better.
things were going badly?
um, you know, mairge stuff.
me and Kirby have been together since junior high.
people change when they grow up. - How so?
um, we kind of drifted, I guess.
my family, the Gerbers-- we're very close.
it can be too much what with us living here together and all.
Kirby got to feeling kind of squashed up against 'em.
he was a lone wolf type.
liked to be in the woods on his own, you know?
was there anyone in particular he had a problem with or whoad a problem with him?
no. No, just me.
and like I say, we'd been doing better recently.
he was being more honest with me, opening up about his feelings.
you know how men can be.
Yes, we do.
money problems?
no, ma'am. Kirby was a skilled welder.
always a good provider and proud of it.
and then you have the oil money coming in.
Yes, ma'am.
how much do you stand to gain?
um, they say each of us younger cousins will get around $80, 000 a year.
I have to point this out to you, Donna.
that gives you strong motive here.
Kirby was entitled to half your money.
if your marriage was in trouble, that would make you pretty unhappy, wouldn't it?
our marriage wasn't in trouble.
the coroner tells us there were many unhealed bruises and contusions on his body, which suggests around three weeks before his death, Kirby was prtttyadly beaten up.
I don't--I don't know anything about that.
next time you feel the urge to get high, maybe you'll see your mother's smiling face.
maybe you'll already feel warm, safe and happy.
maybe you'll realize that high feeling you get from drugs is an illusion, - nothing more than chemicals moving around in your brain. - Inmate Jane.
inmate jane to the visiting room.
inmate jane to the visiting room.
more later. You are doing great.
that's the case paperwork so far.
that's a copy of the victim's noteok.
and those are some sudoku puzzles.
still like Luscom for it?
Yeah, he's got attitude and motive.
but the coroner says Kirby Hines was badly beaten up about a month ago, at which time Luscom was in custody on a d. U.I. And resisting arrest beef.
could have been one of Luscom's friends that did it.
Yeah, only Hines never reported a beating, didn't go to a hospital, and his wife Denies any knowledge of it.
you think Kirby and his wife could have kept quiet about the beating 'cause it was a family matter?
Yeah. Lisbon's with the father-in-law now.
Kirby took a beatin' last month? I don't caca that.
from the way Donna reacted when I asked her about it, it seemed to be a family matter.
maybe you or your son roddy got involved in donna's marital problems?
no. No, ma'am, that's way off.
well, hey, baby cakes.
you okay? Are you sick or something?
do I look sick?
well, it's not like you walking around in sweats, no makeup, your hair all up like that.
well, excuse me. My stepdaughter's husband just died. I'm grieving.
that's cool. That's cool. - Who's your friend?
Oh, this is agent lisbon from cbi, come about poor kirby.
my wife Sandrine.
I need to go to the mall.
what's your theory, Sandrine? Who killed Kirby?
well, I don't know. Do I have to have an answer?
I thought that was you guys' job.
worth asking. - I'll be honest.
I'm sorry Kirby's dead, but I'm not sorry my daughter isn't married to a loser anymore.
in what way was he a loser?
he was a buzzkill. The gerber family's moving on up, and kirby didn't like that.
he liked being poor and whatever. No vision.
Donna deserves more than that. Right, Sand?
she's a treasure.
agent Bosco, a word? - Sure.
I know you're busy, so I won't take up your time shooting the breeze, - beating around the bush and all. - That's what you're doing.
we want to talk about Jane.
look, we know that Jane crossed the line, but you help us out here and, uh, we'll be extremely grateful. We'll owe you big-time.
Oh, okay. I see.
so let's say I, uh, reach out for you to do some stuff.
what kind of stuff?
well, the kind of stuff that needs to get done sometimes, you know, to take the bad guys down, keep the good guys walking around.
nothing illegal. Maybe a little rule bending on the down low.
that's no problem.
see, that's my exact point. There is a problem.
there's no rule bending in the cbi.
you two guys are good agents, but Jane has corrupted you.
no, he hasn't.
so you were ready to bend the rules before he got here?
thanks for your time. - Nice talking to you.
"vultures!!!" "vultures!!!" what does that mean?
who are Jay and Martin?
you know, vultures pee on their legs to cool themselves.
is that right?
Yes, of course.
what does "vultures!!!" mean?
vultures are birds. - No kidding.
hines waa bibi-watcher.
that's why he had binoculars.
he saw jays and martins and vultures.
got it. Good. So that's a dead-end.
no, on the contrary, it's a breakthrough.
I need to speak with Roddy Gerber. I gotta ask him some questions.
well, Rigsby's gone to meet him. Tell me, and i'll tell rigsby what to ask him.
Oh, now where is the fun in that for me?
can't you bring Gerber in here? - No.
okay, no problem. I'll sort it out.
I'll call you back. - Wait. You...
Hey, jaily.
uh, listen, I just want to give you the heads-up.
I have a very strong feeling Roddy Gerber is gonna be hostile and aggressive towards you, so you should probably be very careful with him.
don't worry. I think I can handle Roddy Gerber.
well, I'm just warning you. Apparently, he's a very tough guy.
Yeah, well, I'd like to see him try something.
we'll see how tough he is. - Whatever.
Roddy gerber? - Yeye, who wants to knowG
agent rigsby, cbi. I'm on my way to your location.
I have a couple of questions i'd like to ask you first... Discreetly.
yeah?
I've heard from a couple of reliable sources that you and Kirby hines were having an affair, uh, some kind of sexual relationship.
that's a damn lie. - Are you sure, Roddy?
lying to a cbi agent is a very serious offense.
I was in the marine corps.
Oh, really? Well, that says it all. I'm ex-army.
marine corps suck eggs.
B9t, hey, no point in arguing over the phone.
we'll sort this out when I get out to your location.
semper fi, sissy britches.
Roddy gerber? Agent rigsby, CBI.
Roddy. Hey, thank you so much for coming.
so, roddy, tell me about the vultures.
I don't know what you're talking about. - Sure you do.
I don't like your tone.
man, we talking we plaling? Come on.
Kirby found turkey vultures nesting on your land, didn't he?
no, he didn't.
turkey vultures are dying out because of a loss of habitat.
they're a protected species.
is that right? - Yeah, it is.
seriously now, you're disrespecting the game.
thank you. - One moment.
they're protected, which means if they're nesting on your land, you can't drill for the oil, and you don't get rich.
that right? - Yes, it is.
so when Kirby tells you about e nene, - you tell kirby to show you where the nest is so that you can destroy it. - No.
only Kirby doesn't want to tell you, so you beat him up a little until he does tell you.
then you go and you shoot the vultures, and you destroy the nest. - No.
bad luck to kill large birds unless you eat 'em.
you didn't eat 'em, did you? - Hell no!
but you admit you shot 'em, though.
they're vultures, man!
you think I'm gonna give up a million bucks over a couple ugly mothers who eat dead people?
no frickin' way.
so you shot 'em.
Yeah, I did. Anybody would.
I can't disagree. - And Kirby?
no, not me. I kicked his ass, yeah.
I didn't kill him. No need.
what the hell's he gonna do to me?
you swear on your mother's grave you didn't kill kirby?
I swear on my mom's grave I didn't kill kirby.
interesting.
no, no, no. I think you should take lead. It's a female thing.
no, it's not. She's female, that's all. He's not.
you should take lead. - Why me?
you're always being, you know, too direct. She won't be offended.
who won't be offended? - Nothing.
well...
uh, we were thinking...
thinking's good. About?
we went to Bosco and asked him to give Jane a break, but he wouldn't.
so we were thinking maybe if you went and asked Bosco to let Jane go as a personal favor to you, between friends, he'd do it.
why would you say that?
well, you know... - It is obvious.
he has a thing for you-- sexual thing.
we're not saying you had an affair or anything, it's just that
he likes you a lot, it seems
the way he looks at you sometimes.
you're mistaken.
Bosco has no particular liking for me, and even if he did, - I wouldn't use it as leverage for jane. - Why not?
because the law is the law.
Jane broke the law, and now he's got to pay the consequences.
Oh, hi, Jane.
I need you to come visit me.
Why? We're busy.
please, Llisbon? It's really important. I need to see you.
also a blueberry muffin.
looks like cranberry.
they didn't have any blueberry.
what's up?
Roddy gerber's innocent.
that's it? - Pretty much.
well, no. Roddy beat up Kirby so he'd tell him where the, uh, protected vultures were nesting so Roddy could kill them, but he says he didn't kill Kirby, and I believe him.
he swore on his mother's grave.
that's interesting, but you could have told me that on the phone.
I needed a visitor so I could get into the visitors room.
how I wish I had my gun.
Hey, crime-fighting's hard. Suck it up.
look, that's why we're here. - Dooley Gerber?
I need to ask him a question.
what question? - Any question. It doesn't matter.
can you keep the guard off me? Could you, please?
it's okay.
Dooley, you can tell me. The truth is you killed your son-in-law. Isn't that true?
and who are you now?
that's a very good answer. Thank you.
so? What'd you learn?
well, that was just a control question.
the next question I ask him is the critical one.
you know what? I don't need my gun. I can just hit you with my chair.
I think you'll find it's bolted to the floor.
do you understand what's happening to you?
you could get a prison sentence.
I understand that you're keeping me in jail in the hopes that you will teach me a lesson.
it's not gonna work.
I am not keeping you in jail. The law is keeping you in jail.
the law, as played by Sam Bosco, and you can make Sam Bosco do anything whenever you like.
right. Because he's so in love with me, I can make him do whatever.
Yes. - No.
no, I was only saying that because that's what Rigsby and the guys were just saying.
it's total nonsense.
Sam Bosco is a happily married man.
he hasn't the faintest interest in me that way.
I have no influence over him whatsoever.
the guys noticed it, too? I'm impressed.
he's very recessive in his passions.
hard to spot that he'd kill and die for you.
trust me, you are way off.
interesting puzzle you present.
lies and truth all mixed together.
look, I hope we can get you out of this mess.
but it's also true that I do hope that you learn a lesson from this.
there are real boundaries in life. These are real prison walls.
only in your mind, Lisbon. Only in your mind.
Hey, help! Hey, help! Hey, deputy!
Hey, hey, man, we got a man down, man! He ain't moving!
deputy, I got a man down! We need help, man!
Oh, crap. We have an inmate down, level nine.
number eight out like a light.
he just ain't movin', man!
sup with him?
damned if I know. He was like this when I got there.
okay, leave him here. I'll call the medic.
you guys go get back on post.
got a customer for you.
no. Okay.
what are you saying?
my hand.
hand?
Steve, come quick.
we got a problem, steve. I need help. I need help!
no, no, no! Someone! Someone!
prisoner loose! There's a prisoner loose!
help! Help!
help, someone!
help! Somebody!
Lisbon, I had a horrible dream.
I dreamt that Jane escaped the county jail.
I dreamt that the sheriff, the a. G.And the district super all called to yell at me.
now you're gonna wake me up, yes?
I'm sorry, sir. I have no excuse for him.
he is beyond out of line.
he's blown it, all right.
we have an a. P.B. Out, but maybe you can contact him, persuade him to come in quietly.
nobody wants him to get hurt.
contact him how? Persuade him how?
you two are close. He'll listen to you.
that's very funny. - What is it funny?
it just is.
Hi, Sam.
where are you?
dooley Gerber's house.
if you send the sheriff over, I'll have Kirby's killer in ten minutes or so.
Jane, you damn fool! - Thank you.
what the hell are you talking about?
you said you had Kirby's killer.
not yet, but I like to be an optimist.
you wouldn't have the makings of a cup of tea, would you?
thank you. - You're welcome.
so listen, uh, roddy told me about the vultures and what he did to kirby.
how did you cope with that, Donna-- your husband being beaten by your brother?
how did you feel about that?
angry. - With who?
myself, my family.
Kirby was a good man, and I let him down.
Oh, honey. - No. No, daddy, it's true.
I let the money blind me. We all did.
excuse me. I got stuff to do.
Oh, please don't go, Sandrine.
I was just gonna say how funny it is when you have a big family fight, it can clarify a situation.
do you think that happened at all?
I wish. - Maybe Kirby found clarity.
maybe Kirby realized how, uh, important it was for him to be truthful.
when we found poor Kirby, he had some flecks of glitter on his face.
and when I saw you, Dooley, at the prison, you had some glitter on your face, too, which means you and kirby were in close coact to the same woman
a woman who likes to wear glitter. That would be you, Sandrine.
you're stupid. - Often.
but I now also see that neither Dooley nor Donna had any notion of this connection between you and he, which means Kirby was very considerate...
considerate enough to warn you before he came clean about your affair.
Oh, baby, I swear on my life there was no affair.
sure there was. You were bored and frustrated. He was available.
no, no, no.
Kirby soon found out what kind of woman you are, and he broke it off, yes?
he wanted to get out of sutter valley.
he wanted to start a new life with his wife, the woman that he actually did love.
but first he felt compelled to have to tell everybody the truth, the fool.
he was gonna ruin your life over what--some birds?
for a beating that he possibly deserved?
why would he do that? You begged him not to tell.
you begged him, he just wouldn't listen.
this is all a lie. That never happened.
Yeah, you had to kill him right there and then.
No! No! It's a lie. It's a lie.
I'm sorry, Sandrine, but we have conclusive forensic evidence from our boys at the crime lab.
the glitter on Kirby's face covered in your D. N.A.--covered.
and d. N.A. Doesn't lie.
I don't know where that came from, 'cause it wasn't me.
police are on their way, Sandrine.
I would be honest with your family, 'cause you may not see them for a while.
tell me that it isn't true. Just tell me.
he made me do it.
he made you do it, huh? - No, he--he made me do it!
She'll-- she'll have her punishment. - Not enough!
Patrick Jane, we know you're in there.
come out with your hands up.
uh, yes, it's me they're after, not you.
and there is no D. N.A. Evidence either.
that scientific, forensic stuff, it's--it's all very overrated.
thank you for the tea. no take-backs.
I'm coming!
Bye.
thank you.
so...
so...
Jane got a confession from Sandrine Gerber. Case closed.
Yeah, the a. G.Likely won't make it stick, what with his key witness being in jail himself
in for a good, long spell once you add in the escape charges.
that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I thought this would teach Jane a lesson.
I thought he'd back down or apologize, but he didn't, and now it's gone too far.
you gotta let him go.
if you drop the charges, the a. G.Won't chase it.
what if I don't want to do that?
don't make me go there, Sam.
what are you saying, exactly?
you know what I'm saying.
I'll talk about what happened eight years ago.
you'd go there? Really?
I don't believe you.
believe me. Here I am.
you would ruin our lives, our careers, over Jane?
does he mean that much to you?
he closes cases.
he closes cases.
is that all it is?
I'm telling you if you don't let Jane go, I'll talk. That's all.
what are you gonna do?
Yeah, okay, you did good.
but there's two things puzzling me. - Yeah?
how did you get out of jail, and how did you get a change of clothes?
Ah, well, I'm glad you asked that question. It was very...
Hey, Lisbon. Simple.
so they let you out, then?
Yes, uh, they did. Thank you very much.
nothing to do with me.
so modest.
Ah, right. Bosco's so in love with me, he'll do whatever I say.
Yes. Yeah, it's a little far-fetched.
he does love you. How could he not?
but he's not the type to bend his principles over love.
so I figure it's something more concrete.
you must have something on him. - You think?
Yes, something he did wrong, something very bad that you know about.
now he's not the type to steal or do drugs, so my guess--he hurt someone.
he killed 'em. He killed a bad guy that he couldn't catch any other way.
no. - Yes, and you helped him do it.
No--you found out after the fact, and you...
let him off the hook because the bad guy deserved it.
no.
I'm touched that you would risk your career over me.
that means a lot to me.
if you're right, and I'm not saying you are,
it would mean I broke the trust of somebody I respect and admire for your sake.
if it is true, I would hope in the future you'd be a little bit more mature and rpoponsle in your behavior.
I'm grateful and all that, but let's not go crazy here.
I should have let you rot in jail.
we've just received a report that the victim has been identified by the san francisco locals as natalie gibecki, although police are keeping the nature of her death under wraps for the moment.
her name's natalie gibecki.
27 years old.
works as a counselor in a youth probation facility a few blocks over.
the mayor serves on the board, so we got the call.
petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes and the marks around the neck indicate that she was strangled.
Where's lisbon?
she's with s. f.p. d. they talked to the victim's boss.
apparently, she was on her way to see a movie with friends.
not likely.
come again?
well, she's wearing a black lace camisole.
she was planning on changing her flats to heels.
her makeup is freshly applied.
she's wearing a very...
very flowery perfume-- j'adore, if i'm not mistaken.
she was going to meet a lover.
married, i'd guess, based on the deception.
excuse me.
Hello?
Hello, patrick.
it's erica flynn.
wow, this is a surprise.
pleasant, I hope.
I bet you're wondering why I'm calling.
Yeah. Thought crossed my mind.
what if I said I wanted to hear your voice?
I'd say you were lying.
not entirely.
Natalie Gibecki--I knew her personally.
she was a client of my matchmaking company.
I'm sorry for your loss.
thank you.
we grew very close during our sessions together, but then you know how that can happen.
what do you want, Erica?
Yes, I haven't said, have I?
no. - I'm calling because i can help you find her killer.
Really? What's his name?
if you want the answer, you know where to find me.
it was nice to hear your voice again, Patrick.
yours, too.
thank you, Dennis.
of course, ms. Flynn.
who was that?
uh, that was erica flynn.
she wants to help out with the investigation.
great. We should fax over the case file and get her a gun.
well, getting her a gun's a bit much, but, uh, I think the case file may help.
I was kidding.
Yeah. You're kidding, right?
please tell me you're kidding.
Hello, patrick.
you look good.
orange suits you.
well, I suppose I have you to thank for my wardrobe.
I didn't kill your husband.
neither did I.
manslaughter. Big difference.
what is this about?
I know who killed natalie gibecki.
how is that possible?
we grew close during our sessions together.
Natalie told me things that she didn't tell anyone else, like the fact that she was seeing someone in secret.
why would she need a dating service if she was already seeing someone?
she met him during our sessions together.
that must have been some time ago.
ten months, but natalie was still seeing him when she died.
I'm sure of it.
how?
I know true love when i see it.
then why the secrecy?
the man natalie was seeing was married.
she kept the affair from everyone.
everyone except you.
Yes.
why are you doing this?
I cared deeply about natalie.
her death is a tragedy, and her killer should be punished.
that was a nice try.
all right. I want out of here.
temporarily, of course.
you have no idea what this is like, Patrick, living in a cage, knowing I'll be here for years.
the truth is, this may be my last chance at freedom while I'm young enough to enjoy it.
I just want to go to the spa, eat at my favorite restaurant, a few harmless indulgences in return for helping you catch a killer.
what if you're lying?
you once said you could see right through me.
transparent as glass," I believe, was how you put it, so tell me, am I lying now?
Natalie gibecki left the youth facility at 8: 14 p. m.
a commuter found her body at 8: 33, giving us a 19-minute window for the murder to have been committed.
and what do we have for motive?
well, there's nothing missing from natalie's body, so robbery seems out.
no sign of sexual assault, either.
Natalie had just returned from a 5-day trip to puerto vallarta.
I'm checking it out.
what about jane's theory about a boyfriend?
we looked into it.
friends all say natalie wasn't seeing anyone.
family? - Only child. Parents died years ago.
all right. Head to the youth facility and talk to the other counselors that were working on natalie's shifts.
see if they know anything.
uh, boss, any way I can skip this and work the phones?
I have an appointment in an hour I can't miss.
are you all right?
Yeah, everything's fine. It's just, uh, something I have to do.
sure.
van pelt? - Sure. On it.
I'm agent van pelt. This is agent cho. We're from cbi.
we're here investigating natalie gibecki's murder.
I don't know how we're gonna tell the boys. They all loved natalie.
do you guys have any idea who did this?
we're still in the early stages of the investigation.
we have reason to believe that natalie may have been romantically involved with someone.
either of you know anything about that?
no. - Yeah, no.
I thought she was single. Hey, kevin!
keep that up, you'll be doing push-ups until you puke.
the relationship could have been with a co-worker.
well, don't look at me.
you didn't like her?
no, I didn't say that.
she-- she just wasn't my type.
what did I just say?
now drop and give me 50. now!
can you think of anyone who may have wanted to harm natalie?
no, but...
we did have a kid go missing from the facility last night.
Hey, trent didn't have anything to do with this.
his name was trent?
Trent matthews. He's 17.
was in here for drug possession and assault.
what time did he go missing?
I saw him at dinner, so sometime after 7: 00.
Yeah, but like I said, he didn't have anything to do with this.
we're gonna need to see his file.
keep going.
you want to let her out of prison?
well, no, I just think Erica could help us.
she knows details of the victim's life.
she may even know the killer.
she says she does.
that she's telling the truth about.
even so, it doesn't mean we need her help.
no, i didn't say that.
I said she could be useful.
what do you think, luther?
I'm intrigued.
sir. - I think...
it's just the kind of innovative thinking the cbi needs more of.
using a convict to catch a killer-- it's synergy.
exactly.
sir, this isn't even our jurisdiction.
we couldn't get her released if we tried.
you're right, but the warden at golden valley state prison has already approved it.
ms. Flynn's guaranteed a fuough through the rehabilitation program that the governor instituted.
apparently, she's a model inmate.
she's a convicted murderer.
convicted manslaughterer, actually.
Oh, well, in that case...
so you agree?
no. She's a dangerous killer, and she's a flight risk.
well, which is exactly why i'll be assigning two agents to guard her at all times.
see, lisbon?
what could possibly go wrong?
excuse me.
synergy.
Hey, cho.
what's up? - You called me.
Oh, yeah, yeah. That's right. I got some background on trent matthews.
he was attending sequoia valley high school before he was busted for possession and assault.
it's not that far from the youth facility.
you think he might head back there?
well, he's alone. Family moved away from the area.
he's probably just looking for some cash and a place to stay.
might try old friends for help.
all right. Van pelt and i will get on it.
Wayne, you ready? Class is about to start.
Oh, yeah, yeah. All set.
welcome, mommies and daddies.
my name is Atoosa, and I will be leading your class today.
welcome to the first step on your amazing journey of parenthood.
now before we begin, I would like each of you to go around the room and offer something about yourselves.
would you like to start?
sure. My name is sarah.
welcome, sarah. - I'm wayne.
welcome, wayne.
okay, I'm 28 weeks.
uh, this is my first child.
wait. Our first child?
Oh, yeah. Definitely our first. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
okay. Our first child.
well, although "our" might be a little misleading.
no, not that this isn't his baby.
I am not some kind of floozy or anything, and, gosh, not that anyone in this room is, uh, you know
no, i--that is-- i just meant, um
she just meant that we're not married.
that--that was it, that we're not married.
no. I mean, yes.
according to the youth facility, trent matthews was busted for possession at this high school three months ago.
you know, kids used to call me "bracey gracie" because I wore braces until I was 17.
what did people call you?
Cho.
that's him.
fight! Fight!...
Hey, break it up! Come on!
get off me, man!
Trent matthews? - What?
CBI. We need a word.
screw your word, man.
you needn't look so glum, Lisbon.
if anything happens, you're not gonna be held responsible.
because that's what I'm worried about.
you know why she's doing this.
to try and escape, most likely.
yet you're going through with it anyway.
are you doing this because you need erica's help or because you want it?
you'll have to sign for custody.
Hello, patrick. - Erica.
inmate erica marie flynn is now in your custody.
take good care of her.
Thanks.
all right. Who is he? - Who?
Natalie's killer.
don't be cute.
Oh, I don't know his name.
it's all in my symphony files.
did I not make that clear?
no, you didn't.
must have slipped her mind.
where are the files?
my lawyer is having them sent to your offices now.
good. Let's get this over with.
you got her?
we got her. Ms. Flynn, I'm agent mcclay.
this is agent morris.
we'll be supervising you during your furlough.
I hope you don't mind. A friend of mine owns a car company...
and has offered me transportation while i'm out.
how thoughtful.
Patrick, are you coming?
this should be fun.
here's your tea.
thanks so much.
Oh, Ron?
Yes, ms. Flynn.
would you mind getting me some lemon for that?
of course.
Hey, boss.
I checked out that trip natalie took to puerto vallarta.
it seems she traveled alone.
she meet anybody there?
I'm not sure.
we've been unable to locate her camera, but natalie did upload travel photos on to a web site, so i'm having those printed out now.
okay. - What is it with this woman?
uh, she can get men to do whatever she wants, and i can't for the life of me figure out why.
Really?
I get it. I mean, if I were a guy.
is that why you were smashing his face in?
hell, yeah.
he's the reason why i got sent to juvie in the first frickin' place.
so you ran away from the youth facility to get revenge?
no, man. I left 'cause i had to.
I wasn't about to get jacked up.
you had a beef with one of the other kids?
just one of my counselors-- big dude named danny.
Yeah.
what happened?
I mean, well, the night i took off, he, uh...
he and natalie were fighting.
I mean, like, for real, you know?
um, she-- she was yelling at him like crazy, man, all up in his face, but, uh, see, Danny
uh, he's real hard with us kids.
he, uh, i mean, he pushes us, smacks us around when no one's lookin'...
except this time natalie saw it go down.
she wasn't too happy about it, you know? I mean, the girl...
the girl just started flippin' out on him.
did things get physical between them?
Oh, well, it was about to, until i stepped in.
I mean...
I mean, y-you can't lay your hands on a woman.
I don't-- I don't give a damn who you are.
but, anyway, I mean, Danny got mad, real mad, so I took off before he could do something about it.
you think danny would have hurt you in retaliation?
I know he would have.
the dude has frickin' issues, man.
he--he should be the one sitting here, not me.
listen, with all bull aside, let me tell you something, all right?
I would never hurt natalie, ever.
I-I got no reason to.
I mean, she--she was one of the only adults who ever treated me like a person, you know?
Yeah, I do.
you okay?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
uh, no. That video was...
Oh, god. It was horrible.
I had no idea that childbirth could be so...
well, so scary.
Oh, it wasn't that bad.
Sarah, I'm a homicide detective.
I've seen some pretty graphic things, but that, uh, nothing prepared me for that.
how do you think I feel? I have to go through it.
Wayne, you're gonna be okay with this, right?
Yeah, i think so.
I-I mean, yes. Y-yes.
all right. Good. Because I...I can't do this on my own.
I know.
what are you looking for in a man?
well, someone generous...
and caring.
someone who puts the needsof others before themselves.
I want a man I can grow old with, a best friend.
problem?
this is so frustrating.
one of natalie's interviews is missing.
how unfortunate.
I know what you're thinking, but I had nothing to do with it.
it's not my problem if your people misplace things.
my people"?
all right. That's enough. Let's go.
where?
back to prison.
you shouldn't be out if you can't actually help with the investigation.
well, just hang on a second.
just 'cause there's a video missing doesn't mean she can't help find natalie's lover, right?
Absolutely.
it's all right here.
Natalie lived for her work.
she dedicated her life to helping others.
the fact that she found love without my service can only mean one thing
the man she was seeing was a co-worker.
I tried that. No luck.
that's because she wasn't working at the youth facility when she met him.
this was ten months ago, remember?
you mean when she was working at the nonprofit, casa encantar?
exactly.
shall we?
we shall.
welcome to casa encantar.
can I help you?
Yes. My fiance and I are looking for a nonprofit to volunteer for.
let me show you around. - ok
we're not usually this busy, but we're throwing a fund-raising event tomorrow night.
it's actually a release party for a book that our c. e.o. has written.
here he is now.
I'm Greg Relin. Welcome.
it's wonderful, what you do here.
thank you.
since we started, we've been lucky enough to build six schools, four clinics, two orphanages throughout mexico, all in small rural villages, some without electricity or running water.
that's our newest orphanage.
we hope to have four more just like it by the end of the year.
if we raise enough support tomorrow night.
so evan's told you about our gala?
there will be plenty of food and drink, even some entertainment.
you're both welcome to come.
see--see what a difference you can make.
thank you very much for the invitation.
tell me, when did you last see natalie gibecki?
I'm sorry?
don't be.
you said you were looking to volunteer.
no, I didn't.
she did, and she also said i was her fiance.
cheeky.
and you are who, exactly?
I'm Patrick Jane. I'm a consultant with the cbi.
I'm investigating natalie's murder.
she was seeing someone here, yes?
not that I know of. Evan?
no. - No?
Oh, of course.
it's a secret, so you wouldn't tell me anyway.
do you mind if I take a look around, talk to some of your employees?
Mm... No.
thank you very much. Good luck with the book.
what about him?
handsome but dim, like a golden retriever.
Natalie would never be interested in someone like that.
who would she be interested in?
someone attractive, witty, compassionate, 25 to 35, fit, good hair, and a romantic at heart.
Oh, that's all?
no wonder she enlisted the help of a professional.
good ones are out there, if you know where to look.
Natalie was a college girl.
she read voraciously.
she was inquisitive, intelligent, and idealistic.
she would need to be with somebody who was the same.
him.
you buy me dinner at my restaurant of choice if i'm right.
no bet.
you're right.
he's the only man that didn't look at you.
I'll spring for dinner if you can get him to confess right now.
bet.
do your thing.
uh, you must be...
uh, richard.
can I help you?
I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?
I can see you're upset.
what? No. No, I... I'm--I'm fine. Uh, bad time for--for what?
it's okay.
Natalie told me all about you.
I'm... Sorry.
you were having an affair with her.
that's ridiculous.
I'm a married man.
Hey, don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.
Natalie was a dear friend of mine.
her passing has been devastating for me.
I can't begin to imagine how you must feel right now.
there's no greater loss than the loss of the person you love.
I didn't think that she had told anyone.
this is richard.
so there's this great little place downtown.
Sicilian chef.
he does wonders with fish-- fresh, simple.
remarkable. I'm suddenly hungry.
Hi, richard.
Yes, we had an argument, but it wasn't a big deal.
you lied about it.
that makes it a big deal.
I didn't think it was relevant.
your shift ended at 8: 00, the same time as natalie's.
Where'd you go after work?
to dinner with a friend.
right afterwards?
Yes, about 8: 30.
this friend have a name?
you don't think I had something to do with this, do you?
this is insane. I didn't kill natalie.
what were you two arguing about?
she didn't like the way i handled a situation with one of the kids.
she thought you were abusing him?
I got in his face, maybe pushed him a little bit, okay?
that's it. It wasn't abuse.
Natalie came in here all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, thinking she was gonna connect with these kids, and it's a great idea, but it doesn't work.
sometimes getting physical is the only thing these animals respond to, you understand?
Yeah, you're right.
abusing kids is against the law.
do you understand?
Yeah. - Good.
okay. Thank you. Bye.
well, richard eldridge will be speaking with one of my colleagues first thin tomorrow morning.
we make a good team, don't we?
y-you said you had a question.
Oh, yes. That.
would you hate me if i told you i was lying?
it's just these days i don't get to spend much time alone with charming men.
well, there's a reason for that-- so you don't kill them.
we all have our baggage.
I've been thinking about you a lot over the past few months.
I often wonder how things would be, had we met under different circumstances.
thinking about what might have been will drive you crazy.
much better to think about what will happen in the future.
Erica. - I like you, patrick.
I hope my directness doesn't make you uncomfortable.
I know what you're doing.
what am I doing?
seducing me to conceal your true purpose, which is to escape.
am I?
seducing you?
no.
I'm not trying to escape, Patrick.
in fact, you don't actually believe I am.
no? - No.
those agents outside the door aren't to keep me from escaping.
they're to keep you and i apart.
I know you have feelings for me.
this whole escape nonsense is just your way of avoiding those feelings.
no, actually, I'm fairly concerned you might try to escape.
then ask yourself this.
if those agents weren't outside the door right now, what would you do?
what will you do?
what are these?
pictures natalie gibecki took when she was on vacation in puerto vallarta.
I was checking them to see if she met anyone...
when she was down there.
did she?
doesn't look like it.
I guess I was done with those.
Natalie and i started seeing each other about a year ago.
you were having an affair.
yes...
but I wasn't just stringing her along.
uh, I planned to leave my wife.
it's just...
you know, it's complicated.
complicated?
because your wife's family has millions of dollars and you make minimum wage at a nonprofit?
what did natalie think about your being married?
she was patient at first.
she knew that i was unhappy.
recently, she got tired of waiting, so she broke things off.
when was that?
two weeks ago.
we hardly spoke during the entire time. I called her.
I asked her to see me. She wouldn't.
she said she needed to get away, clear her head.
and that why e nt puertvaarta. - yes.
I assum that was the end.
then a few days ag she called.
she wanted to see .
she was going to meet yo the night she was killed?
Yes.
the same little bar we always go to.
I waited an hour.
when she didn't show, I just...
uh, I assumed that she had changed her mind.
I-I know that-- that you're just-- you're doing your job, agent Lisbon.
I would never do this to natalie.
I couldn't.
Natalie was going to meet you the night she was killed
a married man she was romantically involved with who doesn't have an alibi for the night of her murder.
you'll forgive me if I'm a little skeptical.
what about the boyfriend?
he said he was going to meet natalie the night she was killed.
here's the name of the place.
you and cho talk to the bartender. See if anybody remembers seeing him.
okay.
Where's erica, getting a mani-pedi?
how'd you know?
all right. This is getting ridiculous.
Erica's served her purpose.
it's time to bring her back to prison.
Oh, we can't do that.
why not?
I need her.
Mr. Jane, ms. Flynn, how nice to see you.
you are here as guests?
uh, well, not-- not exactly.
I hope there's not some problem.
Mr. Relin didn't tell you?
tell me what?
Erica and i are performing tonight.
just a little something we've been working on.
it's all been arranged.
um... How fantastic.
well, let's hope.
okay. Thank you.
good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
my name is patrick jane.
for tonight and for a very good cause, let's all imagine that this, uh, tawdry hotel ballroom is, in fact, the casa encantar, the enchanted house.
ladies and gentlemen, my lovely assistant erica.
Erica and I will conjure up spirits that will awe and amaze you, and then we will turn that awed amazement into cold, hard cash that will help feed, clothe, and educate thousands of homeless orphans.
as you can see, erica has set the stage with four boxes.
now order for this performance to work, we need four willing volunteers.
once you're chosen, please make your way promptly to the stage.
don't be shy.
this shouldn't hurt one little bit.
a quick hand for these brave souls.
thank you, erica.
looking fetching in green.
now, ladies and gentlemen, please pay close attention.
you're about to witness something that i can pretty much guarantee you've never seen before.
something clouded in the unknown in a world of clairvoyants and divination, a world of spirits.
now i know some of you don't believe that spirits exist, but trust me when i tell you they are very real.
they're here in this room right now speaking to me, just as i am speaking to you, and they're telling me that one of these individuals here is harboring a deep, dark secret. Huh?
don't believe me?
fantastic.
that gives me the chance to prove it to you.
you, sir.
what's your name?
Richard, are you here alone?
Yes.
thank you. Would you step forward?
inside one of these boxes is an item that holds great significance to you.
I don't know which box it's in, and neither do you.
am I correct?
correct.
all right, Richard. I need you to concentrate now.
I need you to concentrate and clear your mind of any distractions.
I would like you to choose two boxes.
two boxes, either on the left side or the right side, please.
there's two boxes left.
I'd like you to choose one, richard.
now you made your choice only with the spirits as your guide?
Yes.
Erica, if you would, open the box, please.
does this necklace mean anything to you, Richard?
Yes.
tell the audience what it means, Richard.
it's the necklace that i gave to natalie.
why did you give it to her?
it was a symbol of my deep and abiding...
love...
for her.
it's okay.
it's okay.
thank you, richard.
if you'll make your way back to your seat. That's okay.
wait!
the spirits are sending me another message.
they're telling me that someone else on this stage has a secret.
Mr. Relin.
a crowd favorite.
you're harboring a deep, dark secret, aren't you?
I don't think so.
Oh, really?
well, let's check, shall we? Step forward, please.
clear your mind and choose two boxes.
now you know the drill.
one box.
thank you.
now you chose this box of your own free will, yes?
I guess so.
Erica, please do the honors. Open the box.
is this photograph of any significance to you?
no.
are you certain?
well, perhaps if you saw it bigger.
now do you recognize it?
it looks like the site you claim to have built an orphanage on, only there's no orphanage.
I don't...
I don't know what you're talking about.
what about now?
there is no orphanage, greg, only a doctored photograph you've been passing off as real.
everything you've said you've done is a lie, greg.
you don't understand.
Oh, but I think they do.
uh, thank you. You've been a lovely audience.
thank you and good night.
you embezzled millions of dollars meant for charity and siphoned the money into your own pockets.
you had everybody fooled until natalie took that trip to mexico.
Natalie called me, said she needed to speak with me about something important, so i met her after work at the subway station.
I offered her a ride.
she told me she had visited one of the orphanages that we built.
and she accused you of lying.
no.
not at first.
she trusted me.
she wanted an explanation, but...
I didn't have one.
what could I say?
she had the photos.
my whole world was threatened.
everything I had built would be gone.
okay. I'm coming.
Wayne. - In here.
what is going on with you?
take a seat.
take a...
Sarah, I,uh...
there's something i have to say to you.
okay.
so i've been thinking a lot about us these last few days...
and, uh... Our situation.
our situation? - Yeah.
and, uh... I want it to change.
are you breaking up with me?
the opposite.
will you marry me?
Oh, no. - No?
I don't want to get married like this.
uh, like what?
Wayne, I don't want you to propose to me just because i'm pregnant.
it's--it's-- it's so not fair to you or to me.
I don't want to live the rest of my life constantly wondering whether my husband loves me.
gosh, you are...
you are a great man.
no, and you are going to be the most amazing father...
really, but...
gosh, we are just not ready for this.
thank you, patrick.
you have no idea how much this meant to me.
you know, you didn't have to leave the other night.
we can't have everything we want.
since when?
if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go freshen up before the car ride.
don't bother.
I know about your lawyer.
lawyer? What lawyer?
we found him a block away with two suitcases, cash, and a forged passport.
I'm sorry, Erica. I love you! I'll wait for you!
touching.
so it's over.
you can't blame a girl for trying.
I'd expect nothing less.
it was nice to see you, patrick.
I had a lovely time.
me, too.
good-bye.
well, when you say it like that, it makes it sound like forever.
just 15 to 20.
all right. Just sign here?
Yes, sir. Bottom of the page.
time to go, ma'am.
of course.
glad that all worked out.
Yeah.
special agent luther wainright?
I'm officer hopkins from golden valley state correctional institution.
we're here to take custody of erica flynn.
I'm sorry. I'm confused.
I just signed custody...
sir?
the u. s. marshals are helping with the search.
she's been flagged on flight lists and all border crossings.
you're wasting your time.
thanks for your optimism.
I have to ask, Jane.
did you know erica was gonna do this?
try to escape?
of course.
I mean, who wouldn't?
you didn't answer my question.
no, I didn't...
answer your question.
Hello? - Hello, patrick.
I wanted to thank you for dinner the other night.
it was the best date i've had in years.
it wasn't a date.
if you say so.
where are you?
someplace warm.
Why? Do you miss me?
something like that.
you know, Patrick, we'd have been good together.
be good together.
I will find you.
it's only a matter of time.
Oh, patrick.
I'm almost looking forward to it.
high school, huh? Must bring back some memories for you.
friday nights, your friends from band, strapping on those funny hats.
you know what? I am not gonna take the bait.
and then after practice, a little spin the bottle... in some wood-paneled rec room.
whatever you say.
Rigsby, what have we got?
Jack McTierney. 28. English teacher.
M. E. puts the time of death between 6: 00 and 9: 00 last night.
apparently he likes to stay late and go jogging around the campus.
Cho's searching his locker now.
looks like it's a blunt-force trauma to the head.
we have a murder weapon?
no, but the M. E. thinks it was metal.
when we got here, there were bats in the equipment bins.
we're testing them for blood now.
did we contact the family?
Yeah, but they're all back East. He's single, lives alone.
all right, start setting up interviews.
anybody who was here between 6: 00 and 9: 00 last night.
you got it.
look at that bruising around the eye.
it's faded. Looks like it's about a week old.
be good to know how that happened.
well, let's ask the principal.
that guy?
cheap power suit, phone holster, Bluetooth, large watch.
has "petty tyrant" written all over him.
excuse me! Sir?
Hi. I'm Agent Lisbon. This is Patrick Jane.
we're with the CBI.
principal Carl Snyder.
thank you so much for coming so quickly.
uh, did Mr. McTierney have any problems?
trouble with a student? - No, I don't think so.
he was a great teacher.
he started working here right after college.
uh, bright kid. Could have made money doing so many things, but he loved teaching.
we were lucky to have him.
now I have a grief counseling session starting momentarily, so thank.
excellent. We'll come. Uh, how did he get the black eye?
he said that he... was playing basketball with some students after school.
but you didn't believe him?
well, why would he lie? Of course I believed him.
no, you didn't.
well, why would I lie?
probably just bureaucratic instinct.
now if you suspected that the black eye story was false, did you have any notion of the true story?
no.
like I said, he was very popular among everyone-- students and faculty alike.
not everyone. I went through McTierney's locker.
nothing unusual. But I found this in his briefcase.
Oh. This is very interesting.
I had the honor of working with Jack McTierney for the past five years.
he was a good teacher, and he will be missed.
thank you, Mr. Loveland.
now is there anyone else who would like to say something... about Mr. McTierney?
We--well, I'd-- I'd like to say something.
Mr. Jane, this is a very sensitive moment.
Yeah, they're just teenagers. They'll get over it.
good morning, everyone. I'm Patrick Jane. I'm with the CBI.
I'm sorry for everyone's loss. Uh... I know you were close to Mr. McTierney, and I was hoping that one of you could tell me who wrote this letter that we found.
dear Mr. McT... I saw what you did, and I'm disgusted. You are a total pig, exclamation point.
I used to think you were special, but you're just a hypocrite like the rest of them.
I can't believe I ever thought you were cool. I hate you.
who would write such a letter? Hmm?
clearly someone who felt betrayed.
a sensitive soul who now feels deep remorse for having spoken so harshly.
someone seated right here in this room.
Yes.
you.
while everyone else was looking around trying to figure out who wrote the letter, you weren't.
you knew who wrote the letter, because it was you. Isn't that right?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Lisbon, you're on.
Hey, stop!
drama, huh?
anyone else have anything to say?
why'd you write this letter, Rachel?
Mr. McT was my favorite teacher.
he always talked about self-respect.
he wanted us girls to value ourselves for our minds.
I-I mean, he was cool with us.
he didn't treat us like idiot kids.
well, what changed?
three nights ago, I was driving to the Food Bank where I volunteer.
it's in kind of a sketchy neighborhood.
and I saw Mr. McTierney talking to, like... a hooker.
and they were fighting. Well, arguing.
and then she got into his car.
I mean... he's a teacher.
what did she look like?
here. I took a picture.
text me that picture and the address that you saw her. Excuse me.
Cho, what's up?
forensics finished up. None of the school's bats show traces of blood.
and we found a baggie of homemade pills in McTierney's car.
looks like M. D.M. A.-- Ecstasy.
turns out our victim had a few secrets.
I've got a student here who says she saw him in an argument with a prostitute.
I'll forward you a picture of the hooker and the address.
you and Rigsby see if you can track her down.
got it.
ecstasy. Interesting.
no, you go on. I'm gonna stay here. Bye.
I'm sorry. May I help you?
no. No help necessary. Uh, you are?
ms. Austin. Uh, drama teacher.
Ah, I was just admiring your set.
uh, what play are you doing? - Hamlet.
a modern interpretation, as you can see.
to die, to sleep."To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub.
that's right.
I'm, uh, worried... about Rachel.
she's in the play. She's really a good kid.
Oh, she'll be fine, unless she murdered Mr. McT.
what do you think? - No.
no. Uh... I can't imagine.
well, if you'll excuse me,
I have five minutes to get bad coffee from the teachers' lounge.
enjoy.
en garde.
well, it's no fun if you just give up.
are you one of the cops?
Cop-adjacent, maybe.
are you in the play? - Yeah, I am.
I'm Jeremiah. I play the ghost.
I am thy father's spirit, doomed for a certain term to walk the night.
sounds cool when you say it. - Ah, thank you.
I'm not sure I'm pulling it off.
I only auditioned to meet the girls.
how's that going for you?
not good.
well, Jeremiah, you seem like a fellow in the know.
let me ask you this.
where could I buy some drugs around here?
what? - Ecstasy, preferably.
I have no idea.
wh-why would you ask?
uh... I want to meet the bad kids.
you know, the kind that might sell drugs to a teacher.
every school has them. Where do they hang out?
um, I w--I wouldn't know where they hang out.
mm, the bad kids keep real low profile.
you wouldn't know, huh?
do you swear? - Yeah. I swear.
well fought.
off with you.
I know the due date's just an estimate, but it
I mean, it could be today, right?
Yea--just promise me that you'll call or text.
sorry. Sarah's freaking out.
how are you doing? - Yeah, good. Solid.
definitely not about to have a heart attack.
Hey, now, back it up. I'm just waiting on my laundry.
laundry? In that outfit?
what are you, a fashion critic?
we're looking for this girl.
you seen her?
I don't know. I lost my glasses.
maybe if I had some money for a new pair.
now I see.
that's like White Chenille.
usually works over on Fremont.
Thanks. Thank you.
but she won't be out yet.
you know where she stays?
come on, honey. We've been over this.
nice bathroom, Luis. Uh, very clean.
sorry?
I was just saying, bathroom-- it's, uh, spotless.
where are all the bad kids?
bad kids? I-I don't know.
okay. Yeah.
nice chatting with you.
Hello?
uh, wait!
Hello, Mr. Jane.
I'm sorry, if I'd have known you wanted to come down here,
I would have had Luis escort you.
perhaps you can help me out. I'm trying to find the delinquents.
well, I... found one myself-- or at least his shoes.
but he managed to get away.
I don't think they're gonna help you much.
Mr. McTierney taught mostly advanced classes.
and where are they?
during class, the kids are... in class.
it's a revolutionary concept, I know.
well. If you'll excuse me, that's lunch.
speaking of which, I'm a little peckish.
Where's the cafeteria?
yes?
are you Chenille? - No. Who's Chenille?
I'm Rigsby. This is Cho. We're with CBI.
look, we know you go by Chenille and your real name's Lindy Hayes.
seems like you got it all figured out.
what do you need me for?
you were with this man, Jack McTierney, three nights ago?
Yeah, so what? I see him a lot.
so he was a regular of yours?
no. He was my English teacher.
what is this about?
Hey. Excuse me. Can I borrow this?
you can have that back.
excuse me.
I just need a moment of your time, then you can get back to your lunch.
I'd like you all to raise your hands.
all of you.
it's official police business.
raise them high.
put your hand down if you're on the Dean's list.
good.
okay, good.
now put your hand down if you're taking the S. A.T. s or planning to take the S. A.T. s.
okay then.
put your hand down if you've never smoked... a cigar-- never mind.
carry on. Enjoy your meat loaf.
bad kids, at last!
no need to run. Don't even think about it.
the place is surrounded.
snipers on the rooftops.
you. - What do you want?
I'm Patrick. What's your name?
Krista. - Krista. I come in peace.
so which of you crazy cats is gonna help me solve McTierney's murder, huh?
you really are bad.
what do you wanna know?
well, while the rest of the kids are stuck inside sharpening their pencils, you're out here roaming free.
I bet you know way more about what's really going on, right?
like who's selling the Ecstasy, for starters.
I wish I knew someone. That would-- that would definitely be a popular kid.
what about McTierney? Did he have any secret vices?
no. He--he was a square.
super clean-cut.
which is why it's so weird he was tight with Mr. Loveland, 'cause Loveland's a crazy drunk.
Loveland? The career counselor?
Yeah. See, a while back, um, Loveland confiscated my friend's cell phone.
so my friend broke into his office and found like a million of those little vodka airplane bottles... Empty.
well, thanks, Krista. Very much.
you know, when you wake up tomorrow morning and you look in the mirror, you will see yourself as if for the very first time, and you will decide to never smoke cigarettes again.
how did you know Jack McTierney?
he was my teacher. Like three years ago.
before I dropped out of school.
back then, he tried to help me with this problem I was having with my stepfather.
what was the problem?
take a wild guess.
if your stepfather was abusing you, you can still have him prosecuted.
whatever.
I ran away to the city. Problem solved.
but I guess Mr. McTierney felt guilty, or something.
cause ever since then, he's been trying to rescue me.
he freaked when I told him I was turning tricks.
what did he say?
you know, that I could still have a normal life.
stuff like that.
then afterward, he'd come to see me like once a week, buy me a cup of coffee, talk to me about getting my G. E.D.
but I didn't want to hear it. So we fought.
we found drugs on McTierney. Ecstasy.
couldn't have been his stuff.
he was a total straight arrow.
was it yours?
ecstasy? That's for amateurs.
do you know if he was having any problems at school?
I don't know.
I mean, he had a couple other projects like me.
I guess one of them could have gone wrong.
projects?
you know... kids he was trying to help.
you got any names?
he tried to keep that stuff pretty private.
but I heard him... arguing on the phone with someone.
Thanks. You've been very helpful.
l-let me know if I can do anything else.
I want to help... for Mr. McTierney.
if you want to help, you should do what he wanted.
go back to school.
Mr. Loveland. You got a minute?
of course. Come in. Yeah. A-anything I can do to help.
well, in that case, why did you punch Mr. McTierney?
how did you know that?
Oh. Well, I-I didn't, but you just told me.
also, drunk people aren't really known for their impulse control.
Hey. Perfectly understandable.
you're working with overachieving children all day.
who wouldn't want to take the edge off? Huh?
look. I know what you must be thinking, but I had eight years sober.
and... my wife left me, and w-we got a new principal, and, well,
I started thinking that a drink might be a good idea, and...
about a month ago, I,uh... tested that theory.
how'd that go?
okay. For a while.
then I started drinking before work, and I realized that I was out of control.
you confided in McTierney.
I thought I could trust him. I was wrong.
he told the principal.
Yeah. He screwed me--royally.
doesn't seem like something McTierney would do.
I know. But when I asked Snyder for some time off, he knew about the drinking.
he couldn't fire me for it, but he could make my life hell.
okay.
uh, wh-wh-where were you when you, uh, uh, told McTierney you relapsed?
w-we were in the men's room.
was there anyone else there?
you think I'd be talking about that kind of stuff if there were?
no, of course not. Thank you.
I take it no baby yet. - No.
got anything to distract me?
well, we finally got into McTierney's computer and looked at his calendar.
he had an advisory meeting scheduled with a kid named Martin Klubock the night he died.
Really? - Yeah, but it's weird.
Martin's an "A" student, and he has no history of disciplinary action at school.
so why was he one of Mr. McTierney's projects?
well... I looked into his attendance records.
he's been out sick a bunch of times this year.
and there was a trip to the emergency room-- a broken rib and some stitches.
you think it's some kind of abuse?
could be, although his folks don't have a record.
anyway, he called in sick to school today.
Yeah. Cho and I will check it out. Gladly.
that guilty creatures sitting in a play have, by the-- the cunning of the scene, so struck to the soul that presently they have proclaimed their malefactions, their shortcomings.
mind if I borrow some of this? Thank you.
for murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most... magnificent organ.
I'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle.
if he but blench... I-I know my course. Line?
Billy! We have been over this. You should have been off book a week ago.
the spirit that I have seen may be a devil, and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape, and so on and so forth.
the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
that was amazing! Well... Are you an actor, Mr. Jane?
well, I've... done a little stage work here and there.
I hope you guys were paying attention.
Billy, did you hear the passion and clarity of his delivery, the--the rhythm?
Yeah. I heard.
okay. Everybody take five while I try to find out what happened with the programs.
well, maybe Mr. Jane could give us a few tips.
I'm sure Mr. Jane doesn't want to be bothered with our little play.
Oh, it's no bother. - Well, then... a brilliant idea.
it's not every day we get a visit from a professional.
in that case, let's warm up with a simple enunciation exercise, shall we?
toy boat, ten times, fast.
toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.
toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.
faster.
jeremiah, you're not projecting.
inhale from the bottom of your stomach, not from the top of your throat.
deep breaths.
ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast.
more voice, more voice. - Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast!
Yes!
Yes! Bravo, Jeremiah!
you are good, Mr. Jane.
any notes for Billy, our Hamlet?
well, remember, Billy, never break character, even if you forget your lines.
I mean, the audience will never know, as long as you keep going.
thank you. I have been telling him that.
and Hamlet's not as pleased with himself as you are, so, uh, dial that back a touch.
as for you, Ms. Austin, you have, uh... something on your... coat.
a leaf. There. All set.
Oh. Thank you, Mr. Jane.
you should come back tomorrow and see the play.
I'm sure all the kinks will be worked out by then.
martin Klubock? - Uh, yes.
I'm Agent Rigsby. This is Agent Cho.
we're with CBI. Your parents home?
uh, no. No, they're at a sales convention in Tucson.
but they'll be back Saturday.
we need to talk to you about Mr. McTierney.
Yeah. Of course.
you got something burning?
uh, no. No, it's fine. It's just some soup.
you had a meeting with Mr. McTierney last night an hour before he died.
uh, I was supposed to meet with him.
uh, but I canceled.
I'm coming down with something.
really, you got something burning. I should check it out.
uh, no, it's fine. - No, come on!
what the hell are you doing?
making Ecstasy.
et voila.
Patrick Jane, please report to the principal's office immediately.
I repeat, Patrick Jane, to the principal's office.
there he is. The principal will be in shortly.
what did you do?
nothing.
11 years in Catholic school, and I never got sent to the principal's office once.
I didn't say I never did anything bad.
I just never got caught. - Ahh. Touche.
it has come... to my... attention that Mr. Jane here performed an act of vandalism into the second floor boy's restroom.
a vicious, personal attack on me.
it's true.
sir, on behalf of the CBI, I apologize.
I appreciate that.
Mr. Jane?
I'm sorry for the senseless act of graffiti.
that's all.
very well.
I will send a bill to CBI which will cover the cost of cleaning, and I would ask that as we move forward with this investigation, it is conducted without Mr. Jane on site.
are we agreed?
how'd you know it was me that graffiti'd the bathroom?
a student told me.
well, that's strange,'cause it was during class, and there was no one else in the bathroom,'cause I checked.
well, somebody saw something, didn't they?
you saw something-- on your unauthorized security cameras.
what?
he has unauthorized security cameras hidden in the bathrooms.
it's a little creepy, huh?
I don't know where you are getting your information, but it is simply not true!
Hello! Pervy perv perv!
secret cameras? That is profoundly illegal.
no. Listen-- listen to me.
these cameras are for disciplinary purposes only.
then why didn't you tell us?
because, as you say, strictly speaking, they are not 100% legal.
principal Snyder, if you're withholding evidence from this investigation, we've got a serious problem.
and the P. T.A. And the A. C.L. U.And all those other acronyms, they're gonna have a host of problems with you, pal.
I wouldn't think of withholding evidence.
I'm not an idiot.
I looked through the footage the night of the murder, and I don't think there is anything there.
frankly, I don't care what you think.
I want all the footage now.
all right. I understand.
agent Lisbon, could I ask that we... keep this discreet?
no.
Martin... you've been manufacturing Ecstasy, a schedule 1 narcotic.
you're 16 years old.
you can be tried as an adult, or you can be tried as a minor.
believe me, you don't want to be tried as an adult.
you lied about meeting Mr. McTierney the night he died.
okay. I met him.
and he confiscated your pills?
that's why we found the drugs on him, right?
Yeah. But he didn't know I was making them. I swear.
I told him I found the pills, and he believed me.
what about your parents? They must have known that there was a drug lab in their basement.
uh, they had no idea about the drugs.
I told them it was for my science fair project.
okay.
so why were you meeting Mr. McTierney?
I had been having some... trouble, and... He was trying to help me.
something to do with your, uh, trip to the emergency room?
Yeah.
Martin... are you getting abused at home?
no. No way.
my parents aren't around enough to abuse me.
so you're getting bullied at school?
not really.
I mean, kids can be morons, but... it's not that bad.
I went to high school.
they eat kids like you for breakfast.
that's what Mr. McTierney was helping you with, right?
whatever.
he tried, but what was he gonna do?
he couldn't be there 24/7.
and what kind of wuss needs a teacher to protect him, anyways?
it just made things worse.
so you decided to become a drug dealer.
I just wanted to be popular.
I thought if I became the cool drug guy, then everything would be different.
I wasn't even gonna sell the "E," just give it away.
I know that's crazy, but... I would do anything.
you know what?
I got my ass kicked in high school.
Yeah, right. - No, seriously.
I was 5'4" till my senior year.
then I grew a foot. Things change.
that would be so awesome.
wait a second.
Hey. What's up?
your--your what broke?
Oh! Oh, oh! Uh, yeah, yeah. Um, I'm on my way.
uh, don't move!
everything okay? - Yeah. Her water broke.
that's a good thing, isn't it? - Yeah. It's, uh... it's happening.
can you tell Lisbon? - Yeah, I got you covered.
thank you. - Good luck.
we've watched 60 hours worth of footage.
I think it's a dead end.
patience, Grasshopper.
I am being patient.
there.
back that up.
okay.
can you--can you grow that? Can you--can you "bigify" it?
I can do a digital zoom.
good.
you know that kid? - It's Billy, our Hamlet.
well, that's interesting.
That's--well, that's very interesting.
what's interesting?
I just talked to the D. A. They're gonna go easy on Martin, but they don't want to pursue Principal Snyder on the illegal cameras no upside.
well, that's a shame. Let's get your jacket on.
we have to go. - Where are we going?
back to school.
excellent. A full house. Make sure you get a good seat.
you're not coming with me?
well, I-I just have to make a quick stop first.
can I have my thespians stage left, please?
time for our pre-show circle. Looking good.
wonderful. Wonderful.
five minutes.
Oh. Hello, Mr. Jane.
how's it going back here?
great. Oh, Sarah.
time to get to the light board.
Lexi, please tuck in that shirt.
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Jane. I have to go.
it is absolute chaos. - Of course. Of course.
Jeremiah. How are you feeling?
you look a little green around the gills.
uh... I'm a little nervous.
well, that's to be expected.
why don't I give you a little breathing exercise just to--to ground you?
Yeah, sure, anything.
belly to the lips. Belly to the lips.
okay. Short, quick breaths.
Yeah. More.
short and quick.
okay... faster.
now big, deep, long-- Lots of oxygen. Lots of oxygen.
there you go. Look how calm you are now.
Yes, yes.
um, there's someone sitting there.
Oh, my God!
should we call an ambulance?
no. No, no. I think I'm okay.
I-I don't know what happened.
you hyperventilated. Silly boy.
I think he'll be fine.
I don't know that he'll be able to perform tonight...
Ohh... But you do have an understudy, don't you?
we have one understudy, and he's already being used because Laertes has mono.
this is just a disaster.
there's no way we can go on without a ghost.
Oh, we have to. We've worked so hard.
can't we replace him? Jeremiah wasn't even that good.
Billy, don't say that.
who could we possibly get to stand in for him?
I don't know. It's such an important role.
stay down. Stay down. - I know!
Oh, you could do it, Mr. Jane.
you already know the lines, don't you? - Well, I...
I couldn't possibly. - Oh, please!
we're screwed if you don't. - Yeah, come on, dude!
what do you say, Ms. Austin?
I think... It's a brilliant idea.
good job, Rachel.
okay then. Well... The show must go on.
thank you. And you can stay in what you're wearing. It's perfect.
two minutes! - Overture and beginners!
stay down.
have after. To what issue will this come?
something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
heaven will direct it.
nay, let's follow him.
all right. Mr. Jane, Billy, scene five. You are on.
speak. I'll go no further.
mark me. - I will.
my hour is almost come, when I to sulphurous and tormenting flames must render myself up.
alas, poor ghost. - Pity me not.
a tale of murder most foul.
the murder of Mr. McTierney!
uh, uh, su-surely... th-thou means the murder of my father, the king.
a murder born of lust in the woods next to the baseball field.
N-nay! Thou means the woods in Denmark!
right? A murder born of unnatural lust between woman and boy.
um... uh, line?
a murder committed by you with this baseball bat.
No! it wasn't me! - No?
it was her!
Lisbon, we have a runner!
well, thank you. You've been a lovely audience.
sorry we had to close... early, but you get the general idea.
pretty much everyone dies-- poisoning, stabbing.
Yeah, it's all very sad. The Scandinavians, huh?
gloomy bunch.
Oh, and by the way, uh, don't do anything naughty in the bathrooms.
principal Snyder has hidden cameras in there.
illegal? Yes.
immoral? You decide.
good night.
we found the bat in your house.
ms. Austin is probably blaming it all on you.
so help yourself out. Talk to me.
she's 35. You're 16. That's statutory rape.
so tell me what happened.
it started last semester in her acting class.
she was, like, passionate about everything, you know?
it was exciting.
and... she told me I was talented and asked me to audition for the play.
we started hooking up after rehearsals.
and then Mr. McTierney saw us when he was jogging that night.
he said he was gonna go to Principal Snyder.
he said she was gonna go to jail.
she asked me to go after him and stop him.
she just wanted to talk to him, she said, to change his mind.
I-I followed him through the woods and out onto the baseball field.
I begged him not to tell.
I didn't want her to get in trouble.
I know what I did to Mr. McTierney is unforgivable, and I wish to God I could undo it, but you have to understand.
what Billy and I have is special.
it's real.
I'm not some pervert.
I love him, and he loves me.
is... that wrong?
Yes.
lindy, hi. What are you doing here?
I just wanted to say thank you for figuring out what happened to Mr. McTierney.
Ohh... you're welcome.
and also... I think I want to do what he said.
you know, get out of the life.
that's good, Lindy. I'm happy for you.
I feel stupid.
I don't know why I'm telling you.
it's just I don't really have anyone else to say it to now that he's gone.
well, I know a social worker.
I'll get you her number.
there's all sorts of programs and shelters.
she can help you.
thank you.
sure.
Hey, how did you know Billy was having an affair with the teacher?
they both had leaves on them from their make-out spot in the woods.
that's it?
well, plus I could see she liked him.
she was meaner to him than the other kids.
you know, like Lisbon is to me.
shut up!
see?
Oh, a text from Rigsby.
it's a boy. Benjamin.
he's so cute.
Yeah, if Winston Churchill was cute.
more like Mao Tse-tung.
Yeah. You're right.
hush. He's gorgeous.
Yeah. He is gorgeous.
I thought the whole alley was on fire.
what were you doing out here?
delivering pizzas.
I like to use this alley as a shortcut.
and did you see anybody when you were out?
no, just, uh, you know, the guy in the car, and-and I didn't even see him at first. Too much smoke.
was he still alive?
I don't think so, no. I mean, how could he be, handcuffed inside a burning car?
who is he, anyway?
we're still working on that.
poor bastard. Burned alive?
that's no way to to go.
Oh, hey, Cho. Scared the hell out of me.
I just found these.
that's very careless of someone... Or perhaps careful.
What'd you find?
not sure yet.
cover me.
we'll be out soon.
Oh, we're not here for what you're here for.
does this belong to anyone?
I guess it's true what they say - "time wounds all heels." These are my favorite.
I'm agent Lisbon with the CBI. What's your name?
I'm the emcee of our troupe. We do a cabaret.
we found your heel in the alleyway, along with a dead man.
he'd been set on fire.
Oh, we heard the sirens outside, but we had no idea.
what were you doing in the alley?
enjoying an ultra slim.
I always smoke a cigarette before the first show.
and what time were you out there?
I don't know exactly. 8:30?
the arson investigator says the fire was set sometime between 8: 45 and 9: 00.
Oh, well, Glennda was with us by then.
Yeah, that's right. She helped me into my compression garments.
I was. Who died? Who was it?
we don't know. - Two minutes to curtain, girls.
if you'll excuse me, the stage is callingng.
hang on a minute.
did you see anybody in the alley?
as a matter of fact, there was a man in a parked car, watching me.
what did he look like?
I couldn't see his face. It was dark, but I felt vulnerable, so I hightailed it back into the club, and that's when I felt my heel break.
why didn't you pick up your heel?
in this dress, darling?
time to welcome the sacramento princess you're dying to possess - The delectable Glennda Snow!
I think he's telling the truth.
I don't know. The other drag queens could have been covering for him.
well, I find it unlikely that a man in heels, sequins, and, uh, an elaborate hairstyle would subdue and handcuff another man and then set him on fire.
Oh, no. Oh, please don't. Please.
then again, he's very forceful.
Oh, and extremely limber.
car was registered to Archie Bloom local boy, 19 years old.
forensics requested dental records to confirm he's the victim.
have we contacted the parents?
Sacramento P. D. spoke with his father last night - Archie Bloom Sr.
he's a local superintendent of schools.
uh, well, what do we know about the cause of death?
nothing till the autopsy, but the coroner found no cause to contradict the theory that he was burned alive.
then that's how we'll proceed.
what was the victim doing in that alley?
we don't know.
uh, the fire was set outside a drag queen venue, but there's a dozen businesses that open up onto that alley.
Archie could have been tied to any one of 'em.
sac P. D. wants to help on this one.
I'll ask them to show the victim's photo around.
one thing I do know is we've got a lot of fingerprints to work with - On the car, on the gas can.
they even found a partial on the handcuffs.
I checked the bar code on one of those gas cans.
it came from a local discount store - Bargain emporium.
you and Rigsby go and check it out.
all right.
okay. I want you and Jane to go talk to Archie Sr.
he's gonna want to believe his son's alive.
careful not to build up his hope.
all right.
he's dead, isn't he?
I know he's dead.
it was his car, right?
we're still waiting for a positive I. D.
but you're moving forward on the premise that it was him, am I right?
Yes. - Thank you.
you don't seem surprised.
I'm not.
m - my son was a victim his whole life.
never a murder victim.
no, but it was my deepest fear... That Archie would get himself into a dangerous situation.
he was a troublemaker?
exactly the opposite. He was the target of troublemakers.
soft, I suppose you could say.
that's why it was so hard asking him to move out.
Archie hadn't been living here?
we had a deal.
I would provide room and board while he earned a college degree, but six months ago...
Archie decided that college snwa't his thing.
so you invited him to leave?
it was a teaching moment.
painful, but necessary.
how'd your wife feel about that?
my wife died when he was 6 years old.
it's been the Archies ever since.
the boy was nothing like me.
why, because he's gay?
I don't... Was he?
is that what it says in your files?
we don't keep files on gay people.
I mean, it's okay if he was. I would never judge anyone based on such criteria.
but if he was, he-he never talked to me about it.
I have to ask.
procedure and all.
where were you last night at 8: 45?
home alone.
working.
I'm writing a book on educational theory.
I'd like to take a look at your son's bedroom, if you don't mind.
down the hall on your right.
how did you know Archie was gay?
well, Archie Sr. named his son after himself, like a king.
he was hoping for an heir, yet there's not one photo of junior in the house.
you think he's ashamed of him.
I mean, well, look at this room.
traditional masculine decor.
bold nautical themes.
it's like a furniture catalog threw up in here.
Yes.
these are not the choices of a teenager.
I think Archie Sr. personally decorated this room in the attempt to butch-up his gay son.
should've seen my room back home. Posters everywhere.
let me guess.
they wrote their own music.
looks like Archie did hang something on the wall.
I'm guessing that was a photo of him and his mother.
what's on his computer?
it's password-protected.
I'll have to take the hard drive back to CBI and run some recovery software.
Oh, okay. You do that.
thank you for coming.
the woman on the phone said that you'd like me to help with your investigation.
Yes. We need to see if your fingerprints match the prints we found at the crime scene.
Oh, so I'm a person of interest?
Yeah, you are.
can I ask you something?
do you always go out like this?
in drag, I mean.
whenever I get dressed, I try to consider where I'm going, who I'm going to see, and how I can blow them away.
let me escort you to fingerprinting.
a police escort.
how could I refuse?
we keep the gas cans back here on aisle 12.
Yeah. Here we go.
those are the ones.
what kind of crime were they used in?
we can't go into the details, but maybe you can help us out.
have you ever seen this man in the store?
I hope so.
he works here.
what did he do?
his car was found on fire last night.
there was a body inside. - Oh, no.
well, was it - We don't know yet.
how long did Archie work here?
uh, a couple months, maybe.
do you know anyone who wanted to hurt him?
Yeah.
Rick. Total douche.
he stocks shelves and quotes "fight club." He picks on Archie all the time.
last week, Archie had bruises all over.
he wouldn't tell me what happened, but I'll bet it was Rick.
is Rick here now?
in the loading bay.
all right. You take it.
a couple more things.
that's right.
let's talk about Archie Bloom.
who are you, his bodyguard?
why would Archie need a bodyguard?
if you don't know... - CBI.
we have reason to believe Archie was murdered last night.
for real?
how?
you tell me.
that's what this is about?
come on, man. I never laid a finger on Archie.
that's not what I heard.
you heard wrong.
are you trying to say you never hassled Archie?
I always hassled Archie.
so what?
we worked together, but I liked him, you know?
every time I'd come across defective merchandise back here, I'd give it to him as a gift.
What'd you give him?
stuffed animals.
an apron.
what?
this was Archie's locker.
I take it he wasn't the one who added the decorations.
no. That would be Rick.
textbook homophobe.
my manager told him to stop, but guys like that...
well, if it was so bad, why didn't Archie just quit?
he said it wasn't any different at his last job.
he wanted to learn how to handle it better.
I gotta go back to the register.
shut the locker when you're done.
sure. Thank you.
Rigsby. - Hey, it's Lisbon.
the dental records came back.
the body inside the car has been confirmed as Archie Bloom.
Oh, that's too bad.
his father gave us an address where he was renting.
Yeah, if you don't mind, I'll get Cho to check it out.
Archie worked in the store here, and I think I found a lead that I want to run down at the office.
sure - Okay . looks like the whole roll was taken.
call me as soon as you process the film. Thank you.
U - um... After you.
such a gentleman.
well, Glennda's prints don't match any of the prints at the crime scene, and I did background checks on the drag queens.
none of them stand out.
Oh, don't let them hear you say that.
Hey, you guys.
I found some videos on Archie's hard drive.
they're inside a hidden partition.
looks like Archie didn't want prying eyes to see.
you found something?
can you play the files?
I think so.
nice guy.
so it seems.
okay. Got it.
uh... Most of these files look like they were created two or three years ago, when Archie was in high school.
no, I am done asking! Into your room
sit.
sit in that chair.
I said,"sit down!" - Let go.
now you are gonna do exactly as I tell you.
you put your left arm on the chair.
you're hurting me.
stop whining! - Are you kidding?
handcuffs?
latest educational tool. - Just do it.
stop! Sit here all night long until your homework is done.
maybe this will toughen you up.
wait.
pause the video.
those are hinged handcuffs, just like the ones used in the victim's murder.
I'm guessing this wasn't the first daddy dearest routine.
Archie had that camera set up and recording before they walked into the room.
play it further.
help me help me
tactical handcuffs, dual-hinged, the same make you used to chain your son to his desk.
what are you talking about?
Archie secretly video taped it.
we found it on his computer.
you don't understand what you were watching.
enlighten us.
the relationship between completed homework and academic achievement is statistically compelling.
with Archie, aggressive techniques were necessary to keep him motivated.
Oh, you motivated him, all right, right out of college.
that was his failure, not mine.
a dropout for a son doesn't look good on the wikipedia page of a wannabe educational giant, does it?
is that why you killed him?
my own son?
because the cuffs happen to look like mine?
we found your fingerprints on 'em.
that's impossible.
unless... I suppose that someone could have stolen them from my office.
you're gonna take that route?
I know how that sounds.
you know, you should consider a lie detector test.
it'll clear all this up.
happily.
give me your hand.
excuse me? - You said,"happily."
okay, just a couple of irrelevant questions to establish a baseline.
what's your name?
you love your son?
Yes.
were you ashamed of him?
it's an irrelevant question. I already know the answer.
the truth, please.
were you ashamed of your son? - Yes.
did you kill him? - No. No, I didn't.
so do you think he killed the victim?
he did, well, at least he feels like he did.
hard to be certain.
guilt comes in many forms.
that's the best you can do?
for now.- Wh-what?
are you wearing perfume?
right.
well, you've been standing close to someone that is.
uh, that would be Glennda.
she's very fragrant.
you just called Glennda "she."
so?
you didn't before.
I have to go.
where?
I just had a thoughtless impulse or an inspired hunch.
I'm not sure which yet.
I'll let you know.
how ya doin'?
agent Cho. CBI.
well, you're not here to buy a book. Who died?
"something good will come of all things yet." How did Archie die?
homicide. His father gave us this address as his last known residence.
my apartment's upstairs.
I rent out my spare room to help cover my lease.
hard to remain a viable literary watering hole when the counterculture is free online.
tell me about your relationship with the victim.
Sacramento is a place of wide lawns and narrow minds.
Archie came here to nourish his soul.
when he mentioned his father kicked him out, I was only too happy to rent him a room.
when was the last time you saw him?
I haven't seen Archie in a week.
he cleared out without leaving a note or his last month's rent.
any idea why?
was he in trouble?
I have nothing to offer anybody but my own confusion.
kerouac. - No. Kesey.
influenced by Kerouac.
common mistake. - No. You.
you keep quoting Kerouac, an overrated bum.
I need you to answer my questions in your own words.
where were you last night at 8: 45?
we caught a break.
on the father?- On the co-worker.
he's 22.
he was seen harassing Archie Bloom at work.
he's got two strikes for larceny, and check this out
I found a disposable camera in Archie's locker and had the film developed.
what was he stealing, baby formula?
Yeah, it's a staple in retail theft gangs, always in demand and way overpriced.
trust me. I know.
if Archie was taking surveillance photos, he must've been planning on exposing Hughes.
a third strike would put Hughes away for a long time.
well, that's a motive for murder.
okay, bring him in, but I'm gonna hold on to the kid's dad for as long as I can.
okay.
uh, sorry to interrupt.
the funeral director told me I'd find you back here.
Hello, Glennda.
peeking behind the curtain.
careful you don't lose your illusions.
well, it's a little late for that... Let me tell you.
they prefer I go by "Glenn" here and act like Glenn.
a funeral cosmetologist.
well, that makes sense.
even a diva needs a day job.
I've always loved makeup, but, uh, wearing it wasn't an option for a boy in Sacramento, so I chose a career in death care.
what brings you to my laboratory?
I wanted to know why you lied to me about the crime scene.
and what makes you think I lied?
well, I-I didn't at first.
uh, I cold-read you as a man.
I thought your theatrical mannerisms were part of the character you played.
I underestimated the extent of your transformation.
3 hours of makeup and a $4, 000 dress has that effect.
you become someone else.
you become... A woman.
mm, and women often act out a part, uh, in the midst of deceit.
they can be emotional or coy or... Seductive.
and I thought I had gender issues.
this is your last chance.
I want the truth, or I call my police friends, and they'll lock you up.
glenn and Glennda - Both be out of work.
What'd you see in that alley?
a man holding a red gas can, pouring it over a car.
was there anyone inside the car?
I don't know. It was dark.
and what did this man look like?
like I said, it was dark.
you're playing dumb again.
I am not playing.
I am scared.
I have been a target my whole life.
I'm not gonna make myself a target for a killer.
did you know that Archie was on to you? - Yeah.
when did he find out?
last week.
we were off-loading boxes, and I heard something by the dumpster.
I looked inside, and it was the little princess.
and what was he doing?
dumpster diving.
okay. For what?
we throw away a lot of junk - You know, busted chairs, old magazines, dead plants.
Archie said something about needing to furnish his new room.
and that's when you assaulted him so he wouldn't be able to call the cops on you?
I'll tell you the same thing I told your cop buddy.
I never laid a finger on Archie!
although I did lock him in that dumpster for a couple of hours.
what?
where were you at 8: 45 last night?
in bed. I'm in bed every night by that time.
I work the 4: 00 a. m. shift.
so in other words, you have no alibi.
no alibi, and your prints were found on the gas cans at the murder scene...
Hey, wait a minute now.
the gas cans that poured accelerant onto the vehicle in which Archie bloom was burned alive.
of course my fingerprints were on those cans.
I personally stocked them on the shelf!
or maybe you stole 'em, like you stole this merchandise, and you killed Archie to avoid a third strike and a mandatory 25 years.
that's it!
I want a lawyer!
sit down! - You hear me?!
a little help! - I want a lawyer!
what do you think?
well, all cruelty stems from weakness, and this one's a quivering mess - Emotionally immature, aggressively masculine.
he harbors childhood pain tied to bed-wetting or some similar humiliation.
Yeah, he could bour killer, too.
you're not making this easy.
Hey, Summer.
Kimball, I need your help.
how fast can you make it to Glenbrook park?
it depends. Is something wrong?
Yes!
it's a matter of life and death.
what's going on? Who's in danger?
the puppies!
there's this pet agency, and-and-and, oh, I- it's so sad, a tragedy, these, uh, poor animals.
I mean, we are so lucky to have homes.
can we talk about this later?
no. No, they're about to pick up, and I need to pick out a puppy for you.
here. Can I have this one, please?
no, no. I don't - I don't want a dog.
but you will when you see this pug.
no, I won't.
he's just like you, Kimball.
he's all fierce on the outside and, like, a softy on the inside, and he's got this really squishy little face.
no, I gotta go. I gotta go.
wait.
how about lunch?
I'm working a case.
Oh, that's perfect. We'll have something to talk about.
no, I have to find out where our victim was living. I don't have time.
Oh, come on, Kimball. You have to eat.
I'll spring for lunch.
you guys owe me a paycheck anyways.
look, I gotta go.
I'll see you tonight.
uh, n-no dogs.
but I want one.
the victim's last known address is 2 miles away.
as far as we know, he has no friends, and he was one step away from being homeless.
now I've been hitting halfway houses all day.
looking for a place he might have crashed.
you're my last hope.
and your best one.
you know him?
it's Archie Bloom.
you, uh... You said he was murdered?
Yeah.
take a minute.
it's okay.
um... Let me show you his room.
my name's Kelly.
I'm a counselor here.
I was assigned to Archie when he came to us last week.
would that be when he left the bookstore where he was renting?
is that what Gabriel told you?
Archie was renting a room?
that's right.
Gabriel took in the boy because he was in love with him, only Gabriel's form of love involved bouts of meth and violence.
here's his bed.
did Archie tell you why he came here?
he didn't want to come.
he wanted to work it out with Gabriel.
Archie felt rejected by his father, so the acceptance of an older male meant a lot to him.
but Gabriel was a predator.
that's how Archie got the bruises.
it was an abusive relationship.
it took a t loof courage, but Archie left everything at Abriel's to join us.
excuse me. - Sure.
Hey, guys, enough.
my client Mr. Bloom has connections, and if you don't let him go, the next call you get will be from the mayor.
I'm sorry, but there are no special privileges.
your client is a murder suspect.
well - Attorney for Rick Hughes.
I'd like to talk to my client, please!
hold on.
Cho. Cho, help me out.
I am desperate here.
I got a lead.
which one? The dad or the co-worker?
the lover.
what lover?
he's a new suspect.
great. Just what I need.
now w-will you t-let me- take me to my client already?- Who was that and what'd they say?
it's a huge mistake to inconvenience my client...
do you realize how long...I've been waiting for, huh? - Any more than you already have...
all the great ones had some form of addiction, hmm?
kerouac's romance was with Benzedrine.
"on the road" would never have been written without it.
Oh, it's the literary detective. I had a feeling you'd be back.
looking for new roommates, Gabriel?
something like that.
you three, out.
okay.
we have a warrant to search your shop and the apartment upstairs.
what are you looking for?
evidence linking you to the murder of Archie Bloom.
why would I kill Archie?
we read his journal. We know all about it
the physical and sexual abuse driven by substance abuse.
crystal meth, to be exact.
Archie's journal was a writing project.
it was a pure work of fiction.
funny. That's not what he told his counselor at the halfway house.
take off your jacket.
all right. There's a limit.
fine. Keep your jacket on.
put your hands on your head so I can search you.
no, you're not.
in Archie's fictional journal, the bad guy kept something interesting inside his jacket.
crystal meth.
uh, o-okay. Okay. Okay.
Yeah, for all your high-minded talk, you're nothing but a predator and a drug addict.
that boy was barely an adult.
and when he threated to tell the police, you killed him, just like the journal said you would.
I didn't. I-ohh.
are you planning on joining this investigation?
because we could really use your help.
I'm weighing evidence in my head.
where do you want to put this one?
interrogation rooms one and two are in use.
I'll put him in three.
that's it. Our stables are full.
we get any more suspects, we're gonna have to convert the janitor's closet.
this is Gabriel Lamb's defense attorney.
Where's my client?
lawyers in my office.
I'll be with you shortly.
did you get anything at the bookstore?
crystal meth. Some on the suspect and 40 grams in his apartment.
looks like he was dealing.
I don't get it. We've got three prime murder suspects, all of whom are guilty of other crimes.
well, thanks to the evidence you were provided.
uncovered, not provided.
semantics.
our best hope to nail the killer is to leverage our evidence while they're still in holding, but which suspect do we go after first?
well, you have three neatly packaged possibilities.
uh, the only way to know for certain who killed Archie Bloom is to convince the witness to talk.
we've got a witness?
Yeah.
sickening, Shangela, truly.
Oh, well, girl, it's getting there.
okay, and then after Shangela, I take the stage, me, me, me, and then I introduce Anita Mandelay for a little burlesque number.
Oh, my. He stops my heart every time.
Hi, Glennda.
Hello, Patrick. - Girls.
well, it seems everyone knows me.
Oops.
we're a close little group back here.
I'm the drag mom for most of these girls.
when you're starting out, it helps to have someone show you the way.
and what do you do for them?
Oh, what don't I do?
I help them figure out where to shop, how to dress, and who to become.
nothing wows like vintage Madonna.
this is Miss Labelled. She runs a pizza joint in river park.
and what did Glennda teach you?
I learned how to market myself.
half off a large pepperoni... If you bring in your ticket stub from the show.
I learned how to keep it simple and make it sparkle.
this is Frita people.
dentist by day, devastating by night.
uh, excuse me.
Wh-what's your name?
and what did Glennda teach you?
how to accept who I am.
wish someone would show me that trick.
Bravo.
so, Patrick, you didn't come all this way just to meet girls.
you're right.
uh, we have some suspects in the murder investigation.
I was hoping that you could come in and pick out the killer from the lineup.
I can't do that.
uh, I might make myself his next target.
enough people hate us for who we are.
I'm not going to give them added incentive.
I thought I made myself clear about that.
well, what you have made clear here is that you know how to celebrate what's different...
and Archie Bloom was different, and he was burned alive for it.
you have to go.
there you are.
I brought this for you.
Thanks.
you aren't gonna eat it?
I'm not hungry.
what are you doing here?
I came to fill out some paperwork.
a girl's gotta get paid.
right.
Yeah, and... I came to see you.
Hey, Summer.
Hey, Teresa.
Hi, boss.
what is that about? - Come here.
are you ashamed of me?
I'm at work. She's my boss.
we need to be discreet.
it's nothing personal.
I get it.
I just wish we could be open, like boyfriend and girlfriend.
we can, if you stop being my C. I.
I don't want to stop. I need this job.
the money's right, and I like it.
it's the first grown-up job I've had.
all right then.
no more fooling around at work, okay?
Yes, sir, agent Cho.
on the double.
Where's my money?
come on.
number 3, please step forward.
what about him?
take your time.
Mm... No, I don't think it's him.
thank you.
number 4, please step forward.
I'd remember him. He's a brute.
thank you, and, number 5, your turn.
you know him?
that one definitely looks familiar.
is he the man you saw in the alley?
um... No, he-no, he's too big.
all of them are too big.
the man that I saw was slender.
well, we tried.
we did more than that.
we confirmed my suspicions.
Glennda, come along. There's some people I'd like you to meet.
uh, you two are free to go.
these sad specimens are the real suspects.
not any longer.
they're tainted.
Jane, do you have any idea what you've done?
I haven't done anything, but it's coming.
Glennda, meet the real suspects.
bachelor number one - A serial bully and a thief.
is that a dude?
bachelor number two owns his own bookstore.
he's a drug-addicted sadist...
even the best dancer in the world would look crazy to those who can't hear the music.
who enjoys bad poetry.
which leaves us with bachelor number three and the lowest life-form of them all
a father that rejected his own son.
thank you.
you just made my attorney's job much easier.
all three of these suspects are equally guilty for lighting the flames that took the life of Archie Bloom.
they can't all be the killer.
well, sure they can, because I figured out who Glennda saw in that alleyway the night the victim was murdered.
Yes. Archie Bloom.
the young man that doused his own car with gas, handcuffed himself to the steering wheel, and then...
lit a match.
if the victim took his own life, it exonerates my client of guilt.
uh, all of our clients.
"Guilt" is a relative term.
you three men drove a boy to take his own life.
but before he did, he left clues to make each one of you a suspect.
what was the point?
he had to know the evidence would never stand up.
Archie rigged it so that if your clients didn't go down for murder, they'd each have to answer for their other crimes.
we're formally charging Rick Hughes with theft, - Gabriel Lamb with drug dealing, and Archie Bloom - Will walk.
I guarantee it.
where is he going?
your client handcuffed his gay son to a desk.
wait till that video gets out.
you're never gonna work again.
it's just a shame a boy had to take his own life to bring each of you to justice.
Carl, get 'em out of here.
such a nice face.
why did he choose our alley to end his life?
sometimes a dark alley is just a dark alley.
well... They've all been processed.
well, that's a big haul today.
solved a murder.
you booked three scumbags, as you coppers like to say.
you should be very proud.
I don't think I've ever been so depressed about a case.
I can't get that kid out of my head.
you want some tea?
I don't think tea's gonna do it.
in that case, I think I know just the thing to cheer you up - Cabaret.
and if hurry, we can catch the late show.
come on. I need to get flowers on the way.
come on.
now who died?
don't mind us.
we come bearing well wishes and flowers, so... - Oh, thank you.
this is, uh, Taeser Lisbon.
Fifi. These are for you.
I just want to wish you luck with your new life.
you deserve the best.
what new life?
are you gonna tell her, or shall I?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
such modesty.
actually, I'm quite surprised you hadn't picked it up.
"Fifi Nix." Phoenix.
risen from the ashes.
Fifi Nix is Archie Bloom?
that's right. I was. Uh, Archie, I mean.
the suicide was staged?
not at first.
it was gonna be real.
they talked me out of it.
where did you get the body?
well, here's hoping I look good in prison orange.
I stole an unclaimed body from the cemetery where I work.
it was destined for the potter's field.
watch the head.
drop it down. Come on.
Oh, my god.
watch your step.
watch the bag.
come on. This way. Come on. Shangela, get the door.
my heel.
come on. Keep going. Keep going.
and what about the dental records?
well, Miss Fmita people over there happens to be a dentist during the day.
Archie's dentist.
uh, I x-rayed the corpse and supplied your department with the film.
that's how I met everyone.
last year, I was getting a checkup.
I noticed traces of eyeliner on my dentist.
he introduced me around.
so you were all in on it?
we're suckers for heartache.
and that's why I lied about what I saw in the alley.
she lied to protect us.
how did you know it was me?
well, you're exactly what I expected to find,
I mean, uh, aside from a little paint and bodywork.
what did you expect to find?
the victim we were investigating wasn't someone preparing to die.
it was someone that wanted to live.
so what are you going to do?
Yes, uh, what are we going to do?
we have a treat for you tonight.
the fiery creation who defies the laws of man and nature.
drag babies, I present to you the transcendent, transformative Fifi Nix.
is that a tear I see
Yeah, right.
just keep watching.
Hey, Patrick. Lorelei.
perhaps we can see each other again.
I do what Red John tells me to do.
accept his friendship.
it's that easy? - Sure.
and you'll need to bring him a gift.
what kind of gift?
Teresa Lisbon's dead body would be the perfect thing.
good luck, Teresa. Love you.
well, the question remains, why did Jane do this?
orders from Red John?
I don't know what to think.
I want arrest warrants prepped for every single member of that CBI team, dead or alive.
FBI! Nobody move!
CBI! Don't shoot! We're CBI agents!
you're making a terrible mistake.
get out. - Got the gift?
red John in there?
our fake deaths were a ruse to trap Red John, and it worked.
what if you and I were friends?
imagine the life we could lead.
go to hell.
you're gonna break down and you're gonna tell us everything you know about Red John.
you're gonna sing like a bird.
no, lover. I won't.
Yes, you will.
Yes, you will.
we're up. - What?
we have a case.
now?
you can't talk to her yet anyhow.
- I'll be right there.
you can't leave your car there.
Hey, boys. You the responding officer?
uh, yes, ma'am.
what have you got?
a 9-1-1 call came in from this location 7: 33 p. m. But, uh, nobody spoke.
door was unlocked, and, uh, this is how we found 'em.
this is Rex Lango and, uh, Callie Karlsen.
they both worked together at the hotel convention center.
uh, this is her place.
so the door was already open?
Yes, sir.
I figure the marks and bruising on the neck indicate strangulation and, uh, he got clubbed to death with the bottle, ah?
Yes.
nice analysis there, Yannick.
couldn't have killed each other, could they?
unlikely. She'd have to be conscious and active to hit him with that bottle.
check out the lipstick on his cheek.
Yeah, so it's your classic love triangle.
third wheel comes in, finds these two kissing, whacks the rival with the bubbly, chokes out jezebel here.
Yeah, that's pretty much what I...
uh, figured. Yeah.
Jane? Thoughts?
well, the champagne's an excellent vintage.
Callie didn't have a steady boyfriend.
uh, no spare toothbrush.
she believes--poor soul-- in a benevolent universe, and she, uh, comes from money.
money?
she works in a hotel.
seen enough. We're out of here.
let forensics do their job.
so, uh, if you need me, you know where to find me.
thank you, officer Yannick. - You're welcome. My pleasure. Anytime.
what are you guys doing here?
what are you doing here?
Hey, Teresa.
what's up?
you're all under suspension, aren't you?
we were told to cover your calls.
suspension?
what? Who are you guys?
FBI. Walk away.
you didn't hear?
the suspensions have been lifted. The brass made a deal.
Yeah, we heard that they were talking.
they put a lid on the whole thing.
it's business as usual.
suspension's lifted.
so you guys don't need to be here.
look, I'm sorry for the mix-up.
wait. Wait.
you mean to tell me that after the monumental crap storm you guys created, they're just gonna let you walk away?
I'm stunned, frankly.
I understand.
I mean, you destroyed the career of a fine FBI agent.
you--you caused the death of your own boss.
and this one?
this one's got assault, narcotics, and fraud charges against him.
dismissed. Part of the deal.
how'd you get such a sweet deal?
uh, we got a deal because, uh, it was the FBI that messed up, not me or the CBI.
the FBI. - That's right.
that's incorrect.
Oh, touche.
we were this close to catching Red John before you blew it.
and even in spite of your interference, we caught Lorelei Martins, so she's our
she's our suspect, and we want her back.
you're not getting her.
Oh, we'll see about that.
we'll see.
"we'll see"?
your inarticulate rage is understandable, but it's misplaced.
you should probably just calm down.
you calm yourself down.
I'm not angry. - No?
your temples are pulsing like some weird undersea creature.
if that's not anger, you should see a doctor.
Jane, stop.
okay, I'm going.
nice to see you. Watch this one.
he's a hothead.
I am sorry. He does that.
I'm not angry.
I believe you.
I just think you people should be in jail, not out working cases.
that's right.
but we're not in jail. We're here, so keep moving.
or else what, you're gonna make us move?
if you like.
then go ahead. Make me move
all right, that's enough.
you're both being childish.
take your hands off! Get off me!
come on. Come on!
get your hands off me!
break it up!
come on. - Sorry.
come on, people. Come on!
I'll see you back at the office.
guys, come on.
stop it! Get off! Get off! No!
welcome back.
thank you so much.
I could not be less happy to be back.
and, uh...
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for, uh...
fixing things.
Yes, sir.
we-- you know, I thought I had, as you say, fixed things, and now I discover that you and your FBI counterparts have been fighting...
at a crime scene?
sir, it was
if I can persuade the FBI to forget this latest incident, you, Jane, are down to your very last chance.
a-and you are only granted this chance because to get rid of you now would be evidence of the scandal we are trying so hard to conceal!
looking on the bright side, we have Lorelei Martins.
she can lead us to Red John.
she knows who he is.
california's most notorious serial killer, caught on your watch.
well, that remains to be seen.
but until I negotiate an arrangement with the feds, you cannot talk to her.
that's the deal!
I understand.
but here's the thing.
the FBI can't have her.
in a half an hour, I have to stand up at a press conference and lie to the people of California in order to protect you, and you are arguing with me now?!
they can't have her.
I will do my best to keep her, but you have
I promise, uh, there'll be no more trouble from me.
I-I won't say a word at this press conference.
you're damn right you won't say a word,'cause you won't be there!
Alexa.
we still have a deal, right?
I'd rather eat spiders, but, yeah, we still have a deal.
good, good.
God, you look fabulous, by the way.
camera ready.
is--is my tie straight?
you understand, Gale, this matter doesn't end here.
you have to give us Lorelei Martins, or there'll be consequences down the line.
consequences for whom?
it was your agents that killed the best chance we've had yet of catching Red John.
it was your Agent Darcy that killed Wainright.
tragic outcome in a deadly force situation.
agent Darcy is devastated.
she's had a nervous collapse, in fact.
your people committed deliberate crimes.
well, that's debatable.
look!
we have agreed to a cover-up.
that's the deal.
if you're saying now that...
you're gonna dig this all up again unless I do your bidding, then no deal.
no, let--let's tell the truth right now.
an FBI agent shot and killed a CBI agent in the midst of a botched operation.
it'll be a huge scandal, we'll probably lose our jobs, but I'm sure we'll both feel better for it.
I am very proud to tell you that last week, in a joint FBI/CBI sting operation of great complexity and danger,
Lorelei Martins, a close associate of notorious serial killer Red John, was arrested.
tragically, in the course of that operation,
CBI Special Agent in charge Luther Wainright was shot and killed.
Luther Wainright was a good friend, a valued colleague, and we all mourn his passing deeply.
he's a hero.
as part of the sting operation, one of our operatives, Patrick Jane, had criminal charges fabricated against him in order to go undercover, and we apologize to the public for that deception.
today, the story is of the great job done by these two teams of consummate professionals working together in harmony.
questions?
this working in harmony business is very hard to believe.
there's a very long public history of disharmony between your two bureaus.
that's why they call it history, Josh.
it's in the past.
exactly.
what we're celebrating today is the dawn of a new era.
just this morning, these two teams began work on another case together.
a double murder in Dupont Gardens.
best of luck on that one, guys.
go get 'em.
let's call it a truce, shall we, guys?
I mean, we're all grownups here.
Yep, sure. - Yeah.
nice place. - It is.
this is like a bad date.
I wish these bozos would just vanish.
four cops.
must be a red ball, huh?
a red ball?
well, that's what you guys call an urgent case, right?
all murder cases are urgent.
Yes, of course.
I-- I would never imply otherwise. I
what can you tell us about Callie and Rex?
um, Callie has been with us two years as a housekeeper.
reliable.
always upbeat.
really, uh, just a lovely girl.
well, a woman, that is.
uh, Rex Lango I don't know so well.
he's only been here a couple weeks and, uh, works over in tech support.
but he seems like, you know, a good fellow.
were they friends?
lovers?
uh, well, I wouldn't know.
um, you know, you should check with their workmates.
- Yes, me and Callie were friends.
she was such a good, kind person.
poor thing. Oh, my God.
did she have any boyfriend troubles that you know of?
men were always asking her out, but she would always say no.
was anybody bothering her?
not that she told me.
what was her relationship with Rex Lango?
none, I don't think.
what about Mr. Norris?
did he have a thing for Callie?
Oh, you think Mr. Norris?
he would ogle her.
but he did that to all the women-- ogle them and, you know, cop a feel sometimes.
he always asks people out, but nobody says yes, because he had a girlfriend once who worked here, and they broke up, and he fired her butt so fast.
you think he did this?
did you get anything useful? - Nope.
you? - Nope.
be right back.
Nah, nothing useful.
uh, excuse me.
Mr. Norris?
uh, thank you so much for your help in the investigation.
I just have a couple more questions before we go. - Yeah.
um... how many employees are you responsible for here at the hotel?
I supervise 210 employees.
that is a lot. - Yeah.
have you ever seen your mother naked?
What?! No!
well, we'll leave that alone for a moment.
let me ask you this.
have you ever looked at Callie Karlsen in a sexual way?
No!
I mean, you know, she's an attractive...
woman. - Sure.
I didn't look away.
so, yes, you looked at her sexually.
uh, have you touched her? - No!
why are you shielding your right side?
are you hiding something?
hiding? I'm not hiding anything!
something. Your--your inside jacket pocket is making you nervous.
No!
what do you have in there?
okay. A wallet.
wh-why are you wanting to hide your wallet from us?
I don't. It's just a wallet.
Hey, you can't do that.
it's a gray area.
Okay--there's nothing in there.
well, look here.
that's our girl, isn't it?
couldn't resist a souvenir, huh?
okay. I have never seen that before in my life.
Really? Has this wallet been out of your possession recently?
no, but--I swear, I-I've never seen that before.
I swear to God.
well, I tell you what, Mr. Norris.
why don't we talk some more downtown, see if we can solve this mystery?
no. No, no, no. No, no.
I've got a hotel to run.
I cannot-- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a second.
he's our suspect.
looks like he's ours to me.
Oh, no. That's not fair.
fair?
what are you, seven years old?
fair!
tell you what. You give us Lorelei Martins, we'll give you this guy.
that's fair.- No? Okay. Bye-bye.
bastards.
Hey, no need to be so grumpy.
you got your wish.
you wanted them to vanish?
vanished.
what is so funny?
they took our suspect.
no, they took their suspect.
Norris isn't our man?
small hands, addicted to routine.
no way a man like that strangles a woman on impulse.
but the photos in his wallet-- Planted.
I took them from Callie's apartment for just such an occasion.
you know full well that is illegal in 20 different ways.
what about your promise to Bertram?
I had my fingers crossed.
didn't you wish for Mancini and Smith to just disappear?
well, voila, your wish was granted, like magic.
now we can focus on catching the real killer while the FBI's dealing with Norris.
that is not the point.
we're supposed to be rebuilding our relationship with the FBI.
rebuilding trust.
trust is not an option.
red John has a friend inside the FBI.
if they get hold of Lorelei, she will die or escape.
Oh, God, here we go. How do you know that?
red John told me.
well, he was lying, of course, to muddy the waters.
why would he tell you the truth?
because he knows we'll assume he's lying.
and he knows we'll begin to suspect the truth anyway.
it's a double bluff to conceal his friend.
or he's lying and he has no friend in the FBI.
why are you so determined to believe that?
because I would like to feel solid ground under my feet.
I would like to trust somebody or something.
you know, you, with your wheels within wheels-- you're driving me nuts.
Hey, boss. - Hey, Grace.
where are we with Karlsen and Lango?
uh, looked into the phone records.
no calls in or out for Lango that evening.
Callie Karlsen called Nicola Karlsen at 7: 15, 18 minutes before the 9-1-1 call.
Hey, boss.
Where's the FBI?
they are pursuing other inquiries.
sweet!
listen to me.
the FBI is a fine organization, and they are our partners.
we need to work with them.
they deserve our respect and our trust
am I clear? - Yeah.
did you contact the sister?
Yes. She lives out in Boone.
she was out of contact for two days at a swap meet in Tahoe.
the local sheriff gave her the news.
what's her story?
Oh, the Karlsen family used to own half of Alameda county.
lost it all in the crash of '06, parents died a year later-- highway collision.
Nicola is the older sister.
single mom, two kids.
jewelry designer is what it says on her I. R.S. forms.
what about Lango?
moved to town from L. A. six months ago.
no rap sheet on him.
no relatives or friends nearby.
we went through his apartment. Nothing.
bare bones. Mattress on the floor.
running from something, maybe?
keep digging on Lango.
it sounds promising.
Jane and I will go talk to the sister.
you two go and canvass the crime scene like you should have instead of fighting with the FBI!
Yes, boss. - Yes, boss.
Hey, Yannick. - Agents.
thanks for your help.
no problem.
just don't hit me, okay?
funny.
Hey, no offense, but...
I never saw that before.
law enforcement agents fighting it out in the street?
you guys are hard-core, man!
Yes.
uh, so, anyway, we started canvassing already.
nothing useful so far.
let's check out the rest of... - Yeah.
all right. Thank you very much for your time.
appreciate it.
saw a young fellow over there-- same one they've been showing on the TV
got beat to death.
and you saw just one man?
Yes, sir.
knocking on her door about 6: 30.
we were sitting out in the sun, then we came inside.
did you ever see him around here before?
no, first time.
she didn't have visitors much.
and then later we heard a scream from over that way, just a little short one, like, uh,"aah!"
and you weren't concerned?
well, no.
at the time, I thought it was, you know, passion.
I said to Bucky,"good for her."
that Karlsen girl got a boyfriend at last.
and what time was this?
I know what time it was because we were checking our lottery tickets on the TV.
it was 10 past 7: 00.
here's me thinking her luck had changed, when really, she was dying.
poor girl.
I'll be right back.
- Um, you must be the CBI.
we're very sorry for your loss.
uh, girls, could you maybe take the boys to your place, watch some TV or something?
I was at a crafts fair in the Sierras.
the hippie geniuses in charge picked a place with great vibes and no cell phone reception.
nic! Call me as soon as you can!
I didn't get that call till last night when I came home.
then I called her, and called and called, and then the sheriff came by this morning.
Nicola, tell us about your sister.
to be honest, we haven't found a motive yet.
who would want to hurt Callie?
I mean, she was a warm, happy spirit. Everybody loved her.
did she have any failed relationships in her past?
no.
what about feuds with neighbors or financial disputes, maybe somebody who felt burned when your family's business went under?
we paid off all the debts.
all of them.
that's why I'm here doing this, a-- and Callie was cleaning rooms instead of going to college.
wow, you make some beautiful things here.
thank you.
do you know Rex Lango?
is that the man who died with her?
no, I've never heard the name before.
well, it seems that, uh, Callie and Rex were, uh, about to drink a very nice vintage champagne-- 1975.
about, uh, 500 bucks a bottle, I'd guess.
at least.
that was the last from my dad's cellar.
there's no way Callie'd take it out of the fridge herself.
she'd been saving that bottle for years for a special occasion, like a talisman.
she would have told you if there was a relationship between with her and Lango?
Yes. Absolutely.
we're very close.
Callie was not interested in finding a man.
she wanted to go to college first and get her career going.
and what kind of career did she want?
she had all kinds of big hopes.
she was the optimist of the two of us.
she always said our luck was gonna turn somehow.
I always said...
don't hold your breath.
Oh, sorry. Excuse me.
I have to takes.
Hello?
there's good news, Jane.
the FBI folded on Lorelei Martins.
she's all yours.
folded?
well, that's not like them.
you want her or not?
Yes. I'm on my way.
uh, we need to go soon.
that's all for now, Nicola.
but I want you to know we're gonna do everything we can to bring whoever did this to justice.
Yes, we sure will.
I don't really care who did this.
justice for them won't help Callie or me.
that was rude. I'm sorry.
it's your job. I'm sure you do it very well.
no apology needed.
you make a very valid point.
can I ask you--how much is this particular one?
what are you thinking?
she's ready to crack.
I meant, what are you thinking of the case we're working on now?
well, that one's a puzzle isn't it?
what the hell is the motive?
I don't think it was the sister. I like her.
so did you buy that bracelet for Lorelei?
no, just a whim.
I liked it.
when I talk to her, I need to be alone.
you will be.
I mean, with nobody watching or listening.
I need to be able to tell her truthfully that we are alone.
okay. - Thank you.
just be careful.
don't get pulled into her game.
what game is that?
I don't know. You tell me.
well, I'm supposed to tell you a game that you're thinking of?
okay.
uh, you're thinking of, uh, Twister?
go ahead.
laugh. But she's practically the first person since your wife that you've, you know...
it wouldn't be surprising if you had feelings for her.
she's a stepping stone to Red John.
I knew that from the beginning.
I don't have any feelings for her.
Hello, Patrick.
is it just us, or are your friends listening?
it's just us.
we're alone. - Good.
it's much nicer that way.
sorry I didn't come to visit you sooner.
I've been a little busy with a case.
it's okay.
I've been enjoying the peace and quiet.
is there anything you need?
I'm fine.
never mind about me.
how are you?
back to solving crimes, huh?
Yeah.
why do you bother?
you're trying to hold back the tide with a broom.
what good are you doing?
I think...
you do it to be close to Teresa Lisbon.
I think you're a little bit in love with her.
I-I do it to, uh...pass the time.
what good are you doing?
not much in here.
but I'll be out soon enough.
how and when is up to Red John.
you think he'll get you out of this?
he'll kill you.
it's easier.
that's okay, if that's what he wants.
you're that far under his control?
