well, do you know, I'd head downhill, personally.
Oh, no, no, uphill!
right, uphill.
looking for the source of a river, uphill.
here we go.
the source of the...
the source of the River Nile.
the Nile, the longest river in the world.
a mighty 4, 000-mile ribbon of year-round water, running from the heart of Africa to the Mediterranean Sea, bringing life and sustenance to millions.
finding its source has occupied the minds and claimed the lives of explorers for thousands of years.
Roman legions, Arab traders, the Victorian British.
all have forged a path through the fast heat of this awe-inspiring continent to find where the raging torrent came from.
and today, we would join that illustrious band of brothers.
we would take up the challenge no matter what the perils, no matter what the hardships, no matter what...
I'm sorry to interrupt myself, but I think we have a problem.
erm...
we've found it.
right.
erm...
erm...
that is Lake Victoria.
it is.
man has known for 160 years that Lake Victoria is the source of the Nile, and it's not like we could miss it.
it's quite large.
it is the size of Latvia.
is it? Yeah.
this exploring is not as hard as I thought it would be.
no, my car hasn't suffered at all.
no, I'm fine.
what are we going to do for the rest of...?
we're only a few minutes in.
we could pretend we haven't. If we stand like this...
no, because you can hear it.
you can't miss it.
what?
look, we've already found it, you idiot.
that is the source of the Nile.
this is not the source of the Nile.
it is.
the source of the Nile is still disputed.
the Victorians thought it was Lake Victoria, "but today we know this huge body of water is fed by many rivers.
one of them is the true source, and even today, in 2012, "experts have not been able to determine which it is.
you will.
you know what?
this is an opportunity for us to write ourselves into the history books.
I mean, finding the source of the Nile, if we can say this is it...
and then it would be marked on a map, and we'd be able to go, "That was us.
this is quite a big one.
that's quite good, actually. I quite like that.
what?
it says experts have not been able to determine which it is.
Yeah.
well, where do we fit in?
we broke out the map, and discovered that two places are currently marked as the source of the Nile.
one in Burundi, found by a Dr Burkhart Waldecker, and one in Rwanda, found by Joanna Lumley.
and since our source had to be further from the Mediterranean than either of these two, it had to be further south.'
hang on, hang on. Here's the Nile, OK, but look.
the Nile also comes here, into this lake, and then this lake, which is connected to that lake.
it doesn't say on the map, but if these two are connected, look, this will be the source of the Nile, down here.
Yeah, but if those two are connected,
I think we'd know about it by now, and they would have drawn it on.
no, no, you say that, but David Livingstone thought the source of the Nile was down here.
so what we need to do is go here and establish that these two are joined up, check it out, we're in business.
and so our epic journey began.
a journey that would see us taking on nature at its most brutal.
there would be lions, insects and thick, glutinous mud.
we'd have to climb every mountain and ford every stream.
and we'd have to do it all in three second-hand cars we'd bought for less than 1, 500 quid each.
right, my car.
well, it's got quite a sticky throttle, but other than that, every single thing works, even the air conditioning.
I've never, ever had a car with working air conditioning before on one of these trips, but I have now, and it is joyous.
the Impreza is all about that engine and drivetrain.
you're just aware, constantly, that this is rally-bred.
versions of ordinary estate cars.
this is the best car here, fact.
it's a cracking car, the Volvo 850 R.
this one's done 145, 000 miles.
it's just clicked over, in fact, onto that figure, and you wouldn't really know.
it's so smooth, the transmission is excellent, the engine is silky, everything works.
except the air conditioning.
but at least that saves me the effort of getting really annoyed when the other two deliberately break it out of spite, jealousy and small-mindedness.
crikey! It's the Ugandan rozzers.
I think the President's just driven past us.
a couple of rules you need to know, really, about Uganda, if you're coming here.
number one, if you're a male homosexual and you indulge in your homosexuality, it's life imprisonment.
that's very important to know.
also, it is compulsory here for motorcyclists to wear crash helmets, unless you are a woman on your way back from the hairdressers.
then you are allowed to wear a carrier bag on your head instead.
I promise that's true!
at this point, the producers told us to stop off at the still bullet-scarred Entebbe Airport.
it was here, in 1976, that Israeli special forces staged a daring operation to rescue passengers from a hijacked airliner.
Oh, wow, look at this!
I'll tell you what, I couldn't be Israeli special forces.
you'd get out of breath.
I'm exhausted.
they'd be sitting there thinking, "Help, here comes help," and then...
sorry, just give us five!
more bullet holes.
out on the balcony, we saw something a bit worrying.'
is that a Ford Scorpio?
where? -There.
it is.
estate.
I'd say that's there for one reason!
that's why they brought us here. Funny.
funny. Because what that is...
that's the forfeit car. It is. If one of our cars goes wrong...
which, let's face it, James, yours is going to break in half.
I've always liked the Scorpio!
you have not!
you know that word you like, James, gopping?
it is gopping!
that was invented. Nothing has ever been more gopping than that!
and as we prepared to leave, 'it looked like one of us would soon be driving it.'
that's full throttle.
it's revving, slightly, but I'm not doing it.
you know this all-mechanical BMW of yours? You were very proud of that.
Yeah.
does it have a fly-by-wire throttle?
Yeah. -Ha-ha-ha!
so it's all mechanical, except that bit?
Jeremy broke out his vast and sophisticated toolkit.'
what else is electrical in here?
not the exhaust manifold.
I've done the fuse box, if that's what that is.
that's an air filter.
right.
it's all mechanical, you can mend it with a hammer!
if this works... Yes?
Ha-ha-ha!
soldier on.
with my throttle still not working brilliantly, we set off for the lakes.
but first, we had to get through Uganda's capital city.
kampala.
this is going to turn out to be one of those places with terrible crash statistics.
in fact, Hammond was wrong.
because to have a crash, first you have to be moving.
holy cow!
that is...
we're never, ever, ever going to get through.
what are we going to do, seriously, here?
we're never, ever going to get through there.
it's probably safe to say the Victorian explorers 'didn't face problems as big as this.'
Oh, Jesus!
Sally Traffic, are you watching this on Radio 2?
because this is what we call a traffic jam.
from now on, just go, "Everything's going very well in England, really.
Oh, my God.
Hammond, this is phenomenal.
it is the heaviest traffic ever, ever seen.
this is just like a scrapyard on the road in front.
cars and vans piled on top of each other.
going to finish our days here.
well, we're all right if we want supper.
I fancy a banana.
excuse me?
not knowing the exchange rate, I accidentally bought more than one.'
no, it's all right. Do I have all of them?
Oh, Christ! Oh, bloody hell!
how do you do that?
how the hell do you do that?
I can't!
three hours later, our average speed made for grim reading.
it must quieten down soon.
it's evening now.
but it didn't.'
it wasn't a dream.
I'm still here.
I can't get over how heavy those bananas were.
how could she have them on her head?
by this stage, we were pretty famished, 'but then breakfast turned up.'
wow, that's just a meat feast in front of me here!
hang on, look, look. Right.
well, you were here first, so do I buy yours?
more bones.
bone.
what, it's goat bone? Yeah.
I don't want that.
how much is the water?
Yes. How much is that?
this one. It just happens to be that.
obviously, it is. Of course it is. Thank you very much.
no, thank you. I've got one.
what is it?
is it a chair leg?
soon we found a dual carriageway, and, at last, the traffic started to move.
freedom!
that's it, that's the end!
we headed west, towards the lakes, surprised at how easy this exploring was turning out to be.
this is just tremendous. This is like being in northern France.
look at that ahead.
ha-ha, Hammond, you don't need a Subaru.
this road is fantastically smooth.
apparently it was built by the Chinese in exchange for some oil deal.
it's like the Swiss have done it, or some Austrians.
Yeah, right now, we could be on the M4.
but the point is, further on, if things get tough, if we end up off this road and on tracks, the other two will be completely stuffed.
I will have the last laugh.
Wow!
it's my town!
we've just entered Jezza.
Oh, no!
when I say we've just entered Jezza, that's a disgusting thought.
we've come into Jezza. No, we haven't come into Jezza.
even though we were on an important mission,
I decided we should pull over and have a look around.
Jezza church.
they've actually had a church where they worship me.
protect and serve?
I've never seen that and those close.
that doesn't make any sense at all.
my name is Jezza.
your name is Jezza?
my name is Jezza.
what do you think of that?
you'll like this, James.
there is Jezza's back alley. Well found.
at this point, to demonstrate that Hammond's car was too small,
James and I bought him a present.
Oh!
do you like it?
we like it, because it's really the dralon. Yeah.
because we know you like dralon because you're from Birmingham.
and we know that you like the peacock and cheetah blend which gives an African and yet Birmingham flavour. Yes.
and I've put it in my car and we know it fits.
we know it fits, and mine. It fits in both our cars.
does it? Yes, it does.
does it really? Yes.
precisely into your car?
it's snug.
snug.
anyway, Hammond. There are plenty of people here who can help you.
good. Let's pop it in the back of my car.
OK, now, maybe I could...
I think he's started to dye his hair.
do you?
have a look. He's 45 and there isn't a grey hair.
you know Paul McCartney? Yeah.
have a look at that.
I think if I maybe...
Oh, easy, yeah. That'll fit.
Yeah.
erm...
is it nearly in? Let's have a look.
pretty close.
what you've got now is a big rear spoiler.
that's how it runs.
right, I think it's time to pull out of Jezza.
I just hope no-one sees me doing it.
as we headed further West, we discovered that rural Uganda 'is the world capital of the speed hump.'
Oh, God!
Ah-ya-ya!
James is now regretting selecting the R.
Oh!
if they get any bigger, I've had it, if I'm honest.
annoyingly, though, the speed mountains 'didn't seem to worry the agri-yob.'
easy. No problem, goodbye.
Ah!
but Jeremy and I suffered, for mile after graunching mile.'
Oh!
that's it, no more.
apart from that one.
but that really was the absolute last one.
Whoa!
Oh, my God!
Oh!
relax.
not yet.
as night started to fall, it was time to look for a hotel.'
Oh!
and Hammond thought we'd stand a better chance of finding one 'if we switched to the side roads.'
which was a great idea'
Whoa!
Whoa!
I can't stop!
Oh! You idiot!
I can't stop it!
well, I can't stop it, either!
I'm enjoying the sounds of disaster behind me.
Hammond, there had better be a really good hotel at the end of this.
these buildings down here, there'll be a very nice hotel.
one of those with a posh book in it.
so, in your mind, because there's tea being grown, there's a sort of plantation house with a veranda and somebody saying, "Would you like a gin sling?
people in white linen suits with hats on have to come to tea plantations to test and buy tea for supermarkets.
I've seen it on the television.
they will need hotels to stay in, there will be one near the tea plantation, if not in it.
fact.
Hammond.
what?'
if we're about to rejoin that main road,
I'm going to have to get out and kill you very slowly, I'm afraid.
I believe that is what has happened, yeah.
still, at least it's a lovely evening.
there you go. I told you there would be a hotel, and there it is.
I don't see anybody coming out to help with our luggage.
so, let's go and check in.
Jesus.
that is characterful, isn't it? No.
have you heard of those boutique hotels?
small, with a style all of their own?
you're getting that room.
this one's got a chair and a table.
I don't think you'd even notice the smell after a while.
Oh, my God.
Hammond!
the next morning, desperate to redeem himself,
Hammond called an emergency breakfast meeting.
let's just face reality here.
we're in Africa, and we're not in a big, touristy bit of Africa, are we?
no.
all the hotels are going to be like that or worse, and I've had an idea.
if you suggest camping, there will be a live and celebrated television death.
your love affair with tenting...
no, I'm not camping.
it's not, I...
let me finish. I haven't said tents.
we've all three got estate cars, yeah? Yes.
why don't we sleep in the cars?
we can control it, it's ours, they're dry, warm...
just get in the car.
actually, that's not a bad idea.
get a sleeping bag, sleep in your car.
I could get a mattress that hasn't got excrement all over it.
but seriously, you could get a mattress in your car, easy.
I could easily get one. I'm not sure about you.
did you have that as an idea?
he sort of did, yeah.
come on, it's like camping, but it's not camping, because there's no tents.
no, you're right, it's a good idea, but don't do that, "Come on,
as if we're supposed to go, "Hammond, you're brilliant, "you've redeemed yourself with quite a good idea." He hasn't.
and this is where you've brought me for breakfast.
no breakfast, then, obviously, because Christ The King, as it turns out, is shut.
which means that Christ The King hasn't risen yet.
that's the problem.
right, come on. It's a plan, it's stuff to do.
we split up, 'and set about getting the stuff we'd need to convert our cars.'
the best hotel room I ever stayed in was in South Beach, in Miami, and what I'm going to try and do is replicate the decor there in the back of my Beemer.
morning. Morning.
do you have any white cotton?
Oh, and it's got a cockerel on it.
Yeah, I'll have one of them and the kettle. Thank you.
nails? Yeah.
deal.
there we go.
and this is half inch? Perfect.
that's quite a lot, isn't it? That's more than I expected.
I didn't think it was this long, I'll be honest.
erm...
Oh!
sorry!
Yes.
this kind of size, for me. Small.
standard size.
5' 7" is enough.
well, 5' 7" and a half.
with all our materials bought, we set to work.'
this is epic!
and then met up to reveal our creations.'
gentlemen, behold the future of exploring.
I've given this some thought.
it'll be a mouse cage.
no. Look! Wow!
let me talk you through it.
I'm just going to climb into the sitting area at the back, but it's not just a sitting area - note the footwell for the feet.
where the spare wheel was? Yeah.
Where's that now?
it's gone. There's a bin in here.
but you can't fail to notice the kitchen.
burners, gas, taps, running water, cold and cold.
do these work? Yes, yes.
so you've got a gas bottle in here?
Yes.
OK. No, that's fine.
and a storage cupboard, full of useful things for me.
along here, everything I need for cooking and eating.
and where do you sleep? There.
there's the bed. You see? Let me get out.
Leopardskin sheets.
we are in Africa. Come and have a look, see.
you can go in by the side entrance.
question.
yes? Our gift.
well, there wasn't room for it.
actually, that is now my upstairs sitting room.
is it?
well, let's move on to have a look at May's car, shall we?
you will see a gentleman explorer's quarters.
it's got a globe, it's got a telescope, it's got maps, it's got music.
it's a library, James. Yeah.
things you don't need when you're looking for the source of the Nile.
number one, library.
well, if you look carefully, you'll see some of the books are about exploring, plus there's a selection of English poets to read in bed.
do any of the books contain the exact location of the true source of the Nile, in which case it's a rather wasted exercise anyway?
no, but it's inspiration.
so there's a library in the front. Yes.
and I'm guessing, in the back, some kind of dungeon.
Whoa! That's not a dungeon, is it?
it's a living quarters combined with a workshop.
that's... I'm genuinely astonished.
would you like me to run through what's in there? Not really.
may I just sneak in, do you mind? Yes.
that doesn't look terribly comfortable.
it's been good enough for the Army for several hundred years.
and this will just make you itch.
it's an itchy blanket. It's designed to remind you how lucky you are.
so you can cook food for us, you can mend mechanical things that go wrong.
keep us going. What have you done?
what have I done? Yes.
you might want to come and have a look.
I should warn you, there are two electronic things on this car.
the throttle, which is broken, and the electronic boot release, which is broken, so I've fitted a manual replacement.
and there you are.
what I've done is I've filled it with Egyptian cotton and duck down.
erm...
is that a coffin? Yeah.
who knew a coffin was dual purpose?
but it is.
it could be used for bodies, or I've used it as a chest of drawers.
washing things, clean clothes, dirty clothes and shoes.
can I just say, it's all very nice, but you haven't considered your colleagues' needs.
well, there are two features on this car that you might be interested in.
in the front, gentlemen, we find here, instead of a passenger seat...
Oh, so you have thought of sustenance, a fridge.
that's good, that's good.
and it runs off the cigarette lighter in the car.
that's a tradable commodity you've got there.
it is, but something even more useful than beer.
no, actually, no.
nearly as useful as beer is what I've fitted over here.
a shower.
and if we peel back the curtain...
Oh, it's a complete bathroom in there.
Oh, yeah. So, you lower this window...
it lowers it automatically?
hang on. Yes, it does, but...
it's not going.
there are three electrical components on this car, as it turns out.
I get it. The window goes down, and that lowers the bog seat, is that right? Yes, exactly.
that's quite theatrical. It doesn't work, but it's very...
well, the battery's somehow gone flat.
I suspect the fridge is drawing quite a lot of power. Mmm.
can I have a jump? No.
with the BMW re-energised, we set off once more for the lakes.'
so, here we are now, Livingstone, Burton and Speke 'in full explorer mode.'
James, with those modifications, will have added, got to be getting on for a tonne, which will have reduced his ground clearance from one inch to much less than one inch.
what an idiot.
I have made it quite heavy.
still, could be worse.'
I've uncovered one design feature in here that I don't like.
the driver?
no. Every time I brake, my curtain closes.
braking.
despite my terrible hardship, we carried on, 'and soon we turned off the road 'where the speed humps were frequent...
.and onto a road where they were continuous.'
Oh, God!
nice. Washboard gravel. My favourite.
once again, though, the agri-yob was unfazed.'
more like it.
finally, I get to do some Subaru-ing.
woo-hoo!
Ha-ha-ha!
because we were now off the beaten track, we started to encounter more animals, but sadly, as we saw in Botswana, the Top Gear cameramen do struggle when they're not filming cars.
no, there!
did you see that, Hammond? It was a monkey.
did you get it?
elephant!
what elephant?
elephant on the right-hand side of the road.
Oh, this is strangely familiar, you telling me about animals that you've just seen that I haven't.
Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, you evil sod!
that reminds me of a television programme.
James, can you think what that television programme was?
shut up, shut up!
shut up, shut up, shut up!
was it Richard Hammond coming to you from a tent in the dark?
was it that one?
Hammond, there was a little man, and he kept saying, "I've had an amazing day, I've seen lots of animals, "but sadly, this is live and it's dark now.
shut up!
eventually, we arrived at Lake Edward.'
whoa, that's a beautiful lake.
so beautiful, in fact, we decided to stop on its shoreline 'for a night in our new accommodation.'
right, let's pitch the tents. Done.
beer? It's already chilled.
that would be lovely. I'll put dinner on.
Oh, God! What?
my bed's gone out of alignment.
Oh, you've got problems. There we go.
what's your problem? Nothing.
no, what's your problem?
nothing. I think the chair, the fringe has just slightly...
what is your problem? Oh, dear!
is this every single thing? I'm just going to tidy up.
it's Hammond's kitchen nightmare.
we sat and watched the sun go down, 'looking forward to Heston Hammond's delicious dinner.'
I'm enjoying the bean course. Yeah, good.
what's next? Beans.
can you honestly not cook anything other than beans? No.
what's that? Fly paper.
do you still not like insects?
you know, they've got their place.
in the world, or something.
is it in your car?
no.
then, it was time for bed.'
nobody in the history of Africa has ever been more comfortable than this.
I'm under a layer of duck down and Egyptian cotton,
I'm watching Kristin Scott Thomas in a film where she's bound to do lesbionics at some point.
I've had some beans.
Oh, this is just heaven.
what's for breakfast?
beans.
today, our exploring would begin in earnest, 'but first, we had to mend Jeremy's car, again.'
what you need under here is an M8 screw, and a home-made little clip made out of tin, which I've got in there.
easy.
while I was doing this, 'Jeremy had time to develop one of his theories.'
gentlemen, this is a map, OK, of what all these famous explorers told the Victorian English was Africa.
now, look at the Sahara Desert.
which is really tough and difficult, we've been there, it's horrible.
all done, every nook and cranny explored.
this is really tough.
sudan, impossible.
awful. All done.
but, here, in this pleasant garden of Eden where we are now, unexplored territories.
what was holding them up?
here?
Yes.
it's not mountainous, every tree has got food growing out of it.
it's a good point, when you think about it.
there's nothing here that would stop you. Gentle wooded hills.
temperature? Lovely.
yet they kept coming out here and saying, "Oh, very difficult, I must go out there for five years.
I shall probably be lost.
it all stinks a bit, doesn't it? Yeah.
so let's just work it out. England, go home.
would you like to go to Mrs Simpson's piano recital "this evening?
or they come out here, dusky , lovely temperature, very pleasant views, great food, get a tan.
write home, tell them it's awful.
Yes, exactly.
send a letter. "Dear Mrs Hammond.
it is with a heavy heart that I write to say "we have not seen Richard for three years.
he's in the vice-like grip of, what's that name? Fever?
I'll put that in fever. Malaria, yeah.
basically, our conclusion is that Victorian explorers were just a bunch of hoorays on a very long gap year.
Yes. Yes.
is that right? Well-funded gap year here.
with all that cleared up, we set off to do exploring.
our task was to scour the perimeter of Lake Edward to see if any of the rivers we crossed were flowing into it from the lake below.
if it turned out these lakes were joined, we would head south to find the true source of the River Nile.
follow me. River this way, gentlemen.
right, this is actual off-road, and it's starting to rain.
Oh, BLEEP!
that's more like it.
feeling confident about your choices of car now, chaps?
are we moving, Hammond, or not?
Yes. The question is for how long, and James, you've gone very quiet.
Yeah, yeah.
this car is just masterful.
Whoa!
James's masterful Volvo was now minus its protective skid plate.'
Oh, dear.
Oh, look, it's all under the car.
they laboured for six long months to cut off the plastic spoiler.
you do that, I'll go and write to your loved ones.
would you, would you? Make it sound a bit better.
put a lion in it, some fever.
build it from there. Exactly.
with the Volvo mostly mended, we got back to exploring, and unlike the Victorian hoorays, we decided not to shilly-shally.'
this is Top Gear exploring.
high-speed exploring!
this is good.
we will cover some ground.
in the racing Volvo, though, life was not so good.'
Ah!
this is going to be bad.
Ah, ah!
I'm going to have to stop for a minute.
our colleague was in considerable pain.'
so we left him behind.'
dear Mrs May.
James has suffered a terrible back injury wrestling a lion.
he will be home, in maybe five years. Please send money.
river, Hammond, river.
Oh, hello, exploring to be done!
we needed for it to be flowing north.'
I've got 68 degrees east.
Yeah.
it's no good to us.
here we go. More exploring.
Yes, now I've got a siren.
it's going that way, east.
river.
that's the angle I want you to tell me.
east. It's no good.
when Captain Backache caught up...'
Whoa!
we still hadn't found a river flowing in the right direction.'
I think this is our final bridge. I think it's the last river.
we don't need to throw a stick in that to see which way it is flowing, do we? Not really.
it is going that way.
sort of southeast. Southeast? Yeah.
our theory about the two lakes being connected was in tatters.
our expedition seemed to be at an end.
so that night in camp, the mood was despondent.
but then, while poring over the maps, I noticed something.'
wait a minute, wait a minute...
Hammond! May! What? Come here, come here, come here.
you see it says here, "source du Nile"? Yes. Source of the Nile.
that is Joanna Lumley's, and that is the furthest the water has to fall down a very wiggly river yes? Yes.
this one is in Burundi, this is the furthest the crow flies from the exit of the Nile.
OK? Yes. Yes.
I believe they are both wrong. Right.
where is the exit of the Nile?
alexandria, which you can see on this. There.
so their rivers flow through Lake Victoria and then go there to another sea, inland sea, effectively.
the Mediterranean isn't even tidal, just like Lake Victoria.
the actual exit of the Nile is Gibraltar, because that is where it goes into the ocean. The ocean is here.
their sources are both to the west of Lake Victoria.
I see what you mean.
we are looking for a river on the east side of Lake Victoria.
do you see what I mean? Because it is further...
it is further from Gibraltar.
and I have found it.
gentleman, the actual source of the Nile is around there.
southeast of Lake Victoria.
that is as far from Gibraltar as you can get. You follow a river called the Grumeti, or it's a tributary of the Grumeti, which I have traced back.
I can't work out exactly where it is but it is about here.
that is the furthest as the crow flies and it is the furthest the water flows.
that is extremely good.
we are here, we have to get from where we are on completely the wrong side of Lake Victoria to the other side, that is going through Rwanda, Tanzania, to there.
it is such a long way. It is a long way.
it's worth it though, isn't it?
the next morning, the Top Gear crew prepared for the long journey that lay ahead.
Hammond, meanwhile, cooked breakfast.' Oh, careless.
and I fitted a new skid plate to protect the underside of my Volvo.'
nobody is allowed to use my car as a lavatory any more.'
you can hear my improvised guard working there, protecting my vital intercooler from mud and sharp points.
to be honest it is a bit of an improvisation, it's not the thickest steel there is.
you have to work with what you've got out in the bush.
I had a cold shower this morning, my penis was like a press stud.
again.
out into the wilderness, in my little mobile house. Hello, chaps.
are you both stuck? 'Are you stuck, James?'
I have gone into a bit of a soft bit, are you stuck?'
I tell you what, let's find out.
Oh, come on! Ha-ha-ha!
I've improved the style of the Subaru no end!
I'm free as well. Ha-ha-ha!
thank you, guys, that was a trap, wasn't it? A bit, yes.
you evil sods.
we pointed our cars at the border with Rwanda and set off on a 600-mile journey to what we now knew was the true source of the Nile.
I wonder if we are heading towards that massive rain cloud.
Yes, we are, aren't we?
as the miles rolled by, we started to climb into the mountains.
Oh, wow, this is very, very pretty, here.
but, we couldn't really admire the view, because the road was starting 'to be a bit of a test for two of the 1, 500 quid second-hand cars.'
my bash plate is earning its keep today.
Oh, cock.
Oh. We are both in the same boat here, James and I.
it is called the HMS Careful.
meanwhile, far ahead, my four-wheel-drive Subaru was scampering along.
come on, come on!
I am king of the forest.
bloody hell, look at this one.
come on, beemer! Come on!
how is it doing this?
Ooh...
absolutely no chance.
annoyingly, I had to ask the agri-yob to come back and help.'
what is the expression about pig in... It's Hammond in mud?
Yeah, it'll pull out. Give him a tug. I'm going to.
did it hit you? Yes, it did What was that?
it was a huge chunk of tree just bounced off...
and smashed my windscreen. Has it? Yeah. We probably should get a move on. I will back it up.
James, get your tow rope out. Go, go, go.
as I pulled James free...'
Yes! Bloody brilliant, Hammond.
.some locals arrived and Jeremy decided 'to give them a quick lecture on his theories of off-road driving.'
now, I believe in speed. Power.
power and speed solves many things.
right... James, how far? Middle of the puddle.
speed and power!
go faster! Speed and power doesn't work. It was doing quite well.
to be honest, I was surprised you got that far.
do you think you could push it out? Yeah. Yes? OK.
which way...? Oh, I've got to get out of the way. These guys are immensely strong.
drive back, drive back. OK.
good going!
there you go.
having freed Jeremy, the men started to build him a new road.'
I wouldn't do that bare feet, I can't watch.
I am assuming he has never got it wrong because he still has an entire right foot.
OK. Three, two, one!
Yes! Well done, that was amazing. Well done.
thank you, guys, that is amazing.
with my dues paid...'
thank you, thank you.
.we were back on our way.'
it is amazing, those guys actually turned out to be Ugandan army.
up here training. God, they are strong.
we hoped that that would be the last of the mud, 'but as the day went on it got even worse.'
Oh, no, I have no steering. No, no, no!
go! Thank you.
it is beached.
bloody hell.
thank you. Hit it.
Oh, cock.
we are just going to blow the clutches to pieces. Going to have to pull it out.
go on, go on, go on, you son of a... Ha-ha-ha!
that was so damn close.
and then, to add to the misery, I discovered there had been treachery.'
how long has that been there? Good grief! You must have...
Hammond, I know what your panto face is. Hammond, where is that?
what are those really big things? They could rip steel.
I know exactly where it is.
I have no idea and you will never get it out of me. May!
is that thing on the front of your car made out of my door?
is that my door? What?
it is from my door, I know it is from my door.
you're not using that bit and it was more useful on my car.
you didn't even notice. That's it, that's it. Can you give me a tow? No!
as evening drew in, conditions started to improve.
this is all feeling a bit Gorillas In The Mist. It's a bit mystical.
it is kinda wonderful.
thanks to my door, the Volvo had survived the ordeal.
but in the BMW, my throttle problem was even worse 'and my handbrake had broken.'
Hammond, keep moving, I can't stop, I can't do hill starts any more. Keep going.
this has to be one of the toughest days we have ever had on Top Gear.
there hasn't been a single moment when one of us wasn't stuck.
no car is built to survive conditions like this. None.
not one.
and there were still more than 500 miles to go.'
Hammond is hot on my tail in the quest for the source of the Nile.
and now Rwanda.
Oh, my God. That might have killed the car.
there she goes. Oh, yes!
gently, gently. We are going in. Stop!
30 seconds.
Oh!
I'm through.
bleep Hammond is not having this.
tonight, one small stumble for man as we build a space-shuttle
I drive a nuclear bomb disguised in a Mercedes
and Simon Pegg makes a "Hot Fuzz" in our reasonably priced car
help!
you're wrong, you're wrong.
hello and welcome to an argument
you see, there are two types of petrol head
you've got idiots like this who like the Porsche 911
and you got people like me who'd rather have anthrax than a 911 cause I'm a Ferrari-person
Yes. But when you actually owned a Ferrari you couldn't leave it parked on the street, go have a dinner really or anything cause you'd spend the whole meal worrying about who is bumping into it or carving their names into its precious painting
that's true. I once left the roof off, it was so full of phlegm when I got back.
you could've swam home, but
exactly, and therefore as a result of that it'd spend its entire life carrying in your home or your garage
and when you are eventually brave enough to wanna use it by that time, the battery was flat. It was hopeless.
Yes, I know. But a Ferrari with a flat-battery is an aesthetic thing
you could enjoy looking at it. That's the...
Yes, but it's not moving
that's why I love the 911 because you can use it everyday to go to places
it's a car!
and now there is a new turbo version which we asked him to drive and hope he'd see the light
this is the biggest 911-turbo they've ever made, but it's still no longer than a Toyota Prius, no wider than a 3-series BMW
and unlike a normal super car, it doesn't have Marilyn Monroe hips, so it doesn't get stuck in multi-storey car parks
what's more, it's not like threading through traffic in a post box, in a Ferrari, you can't really see where the buses are, so you got problem up but in this, you can
in a Ferrari, you'd be forever worried about scrunching the nose on a speed hump but not in a 911
and it doesn't even harm the sky very much either
it may have a flat-6 twin turbo engine but it only produces 300 carbon dioxides that's 100 less than you'd get from the back of a Ferrari 430
if you drive this car through a really polluted city
Los Angeles, /, /, something like that the gas coming out of the exhaust pipes is less toxic than the air going into the engine and I'm not joking. That's true
this then is like a small efficient easy-to-use vacuum cleaner
I should have called it a Porsche-Dyson
and it will suck up your luggage too because unlike any other super car, its boot is easily big enough for you weekly shop
there is the peach and peacock the corner stone of any Porsche driver's Sunday lunch and there's still room left over for the ice-cream made from the bones of you defeated squash opponent.
and you can use this car on a school run because it has back seats. I mean obviously，you'd have to have fairly thin children but then you would have because you've got a Porsche 911
so you'd have a thin wife
I'll conceive then there is no everyday situation that flummoxes a 911 turbo
and so because you can use it everyday its battery won't be flat when the moment is right and you'll fancy your drive
the new 911-turbo has special variable vane turbochargers that always work, whatever the rev is.
you could even buy a special over boost facility which for brief moments can deliver 500 torques that gives you the very muscly feel
and it got a special new Four-Wheel-Drive system that it doesn't allow any form of under or over steer
you just get so much grip that your eyes start to hurt like being in a capsule of speed
so, when the sun goes down you could really get cracking
OK. Let's engage the stability management program and put it in sport mode that changes things a bit
now every time I turn the steering wheel, it feels like I'm drawing a line through the laws of physics
this is not driving, this is pure math
so how does it compare to my beloved Ferrari
well, it has a smaller engine but because of the scram jet turbochargers it produces 480 BHP exactly what you get from a 430
but then this is lighter than the Ferrari thanks to aluminum doors which weigh just 11 Kg each
it's also 20, 000 pounds less expensive
sure, it isn't as exiting as the Ferrari it's more about engineering than passion but I would admit the end results are astonishing
let me give you some performance figures 0-60 3. 9 sec
top speed, near as makes no difference, 200 miles an hour and this is my favourite, OK? 40-60 in 2nd gear, 1 sec 1!
it's amazing because it's not just more usable than a Ferrari more practical
but I think out here in the real world with crests and dips and bumps and blind browse
I think it's faster as well
I really do
now, you see
ladies and gentlemen we must all rejoice because Clarkson has finally caught the bug
I still prefer the Ferrari
well, hang on. You've just spend the last 6 minutes wasting our time telling us that's faster, more powerful, lighter and more practical
and cheaper. The thing is, now, I'm sorry that's like sitting in a Volkswagon beetle with mustard up its bottom
well, it's better than sitting there in a car that won't start but just looks a bit pretty.
look, can we just... Can I say this argument has been going on for 40 years
it will go on for another 40 years. The correct place is in the pub
so we will do the news
no. Cause I've just thought of something else. OK?
it's really simple. It's all to do with I have passion for the Ferrari. I respect that but I have pass...
it's like David Atombra
I respect David Atombra and we just infinitely respect in the same way we respect that car but I have no passion for him. I don't wanna make love to him
but I have respect and passion for the 911
there you are. You've just admit on TV you wanna make love to David Atombra
he has just said that.
your logic sometimes, mate, is the most / thing...
shut up!
OK? We should do the news. - Right.
and now the news. And we begin this week with...
with the Porsche 911
more specifically the Porsche 911 GT3 RS
Oh now, that's the business.
it's faster, it's lighter, it's tauter, it's possibly the ultimate 911
in the same way the Ebola is the ultimate tropical disease.
what's with all that scaffolding in there?
it's a roll cage for when you take it on the race track
I'm sorry. If I see scaffolding around a building, I don't think that one's finished.
I'm sorry, actually they're unfinished.
no, it's a roll cage.
look, I'll admit this is perhaps the only problem with this otherwise brilliant car is that it's not the most practical
if you wanna pop down to the newspaper shop, you've gotta clamber in over the roll cage, lower yourself into the bucket seat, do up the 6-point race harness, prime the fire extinguisher system, it's gonna take time.
so in the real world, my 1. 2 Liter fiat panda is faster to the shops - No, mate, it's just not... - I only have to put the seat belt on once,
you've got to do it 6 times.
OK. I've got to do that and then wait while you put you seat belts on and then do all your pre-flight checks make sure the air vents are working...
can I just move this along? Do you mind? Is that alright?
cuz I've got something that's really bugging me.
has anyone seem these average speed cameras they are kicking around now?
do you know what I mean?
so you've got to do... I was xxx the M25 the other day, through the road works, had to do an average of 40 miles/h measured by 2 cameras, 1 at the beginning 1 at the end.
that's impossible
it's impossible because you're driving along and you sort of looking around and oh god, I'm doing 42 cuz I'm doing down hill
you think that I've been doing that for half a mile so I need to do half a mile at 38
which means you could only look at the speedometer
you can't look at anything else only the speedometer
you're going through road works in a m25 in the rain in rash hour.
and I know what they're doing here. It's the government.
gordon Brown has worked out that he's got to pay all our pensions cuz we're gonna live for ever.
they are trying to kill us off.
I know how to get round it, OK? Go pass the first camera, pull over, get the newspaper out, read it, listen to the radio for 10 mins.
do 120 for the rest way of it.
that's not quite wrong actually.
cuz I can prove that the way to keep traffic moving through the road works which is where those average cameras are is for everybody to go faster from the start.
Yeah. - It's all down to the work of the Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli. You're familiar with him?
Oh, him.
thought so. - He isn't.
he is.
he's never heard of him.
but what he essentially proved was that in a system, the pressure and the volume multiplied together must be a constant, so if you've got a busy motor way and it gets thinner, there's less space for the cars to go through they must go faster for the flow rate of cars to remain the same.
so it's like when you put your thumb over the end of a hose pipe, the water comes out quicker.
that's exactly what it's like, yeah.
so how fast then if you take 3-lane motorway down to 1 lane?
how fast does the traffic have to move in order to keep the flow rate the same?
well the formula would be Vn=Lo/LrVe
so how fast?
it's 210
210 miles/h. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen - Fair enough.
all go and buy Bugattis and Zondas to cure congestion.
of course the big news this week that's been occupying all the bulletins is that 1. 5 million people have signed this petition protesting about the plans to implement road charging, pay-as-you-go stuff.
now if you want to add your name to that petition here is the address
that's the address, now obviously, this being the BBC if you think road pricing is a good idea and you want to register you thoughts on that
this is the website too. There it is.
and best of luck with that.
the Mitsubishi Evo, we love that car, it's a great car, isn't it?
well this is the new one, the Evo 10, this is what it's probably gonna look like, um they've loaded it with loads of technology again, it's got all these initials, ACED, AYC, ASC, SAWC, MIVEC
good, yeah, keep talking like that... If that's got all the technologies, - I mean, really road-crushing technology. -It had to be there.
and it looks as good as that.
suddenly, why do you need super cars? - Yeah, why do you? Cuz...
it looks like that and goes as well as it could, there is a slight warning associated with those cars there, because of all that technology, I mean when they really do, they're gonna be unflattering to drive, like one of those automatic pianos where you play it and you take your hands off and it carries on playing there's a danger the cars are like that.
if you get passengers with you and they are looking at you admiringly thinking:
wow what a brilliant driver, you're excellent!
don't take your hands off the wheel...cuz...
it will keep going. - Then you'll look like an idiot.
and now, a couple of time, recently on the program, we've said that there'll never be a car to beat the Bugatti Veyron in our life time, it's the ultimate expression of the automotive engineering, and will be for some time.
turns out, we might have been wrong, because look at this.
this is called the melling hell cat got some figures for you it's got a 6 liter quad-turbo V10, 1175 brake horse power, and the top speed they're saying of 270 miles an hour.
Oh rubbish. - What?
that's rubbish. I bet you that's not slippery enough.
you mean not aerodynamic enough? - Yeah.
can you please not ask me to be the one to find out. I just don't fancy it.
Hey, last week, did you see the American program last week?
you know we got into a spot of bothering a petrol station in Alabama?
turned out we missed the trick.
cuz you know when that woman came out and she said "Are you gay or looking to get beat up in a hip town or what?
and I said "Oh no no, actually I'm married with 3 children."
if only you'd said "well, actually I'm married with 2 children," we could have just pointed at the bachelor boy there.
but the one with the long hair isn't.
of course they would have kicked the snot out of him.
chaps...
yeah?
news from the BBC, OK?
if you're a BBC employee and you drive flea cars or hired cars, you've now got to go on a safe-driving program.
but we drive though, do we have to...?
we do, yes we do.
no way.
I'm absolutely not kidding.
it says here that uh... BBC... driving is now acknowledged as one of the most serious work related health and safety issues.
it isn't.
it's just something that's more comfortable than walking.
Yes. - And then it goes on, the BBC committed in reducing the risk associated with this activity.
they're making it sound like masturbation.
stop driving or go blind.
exactly.
this is...just... I've got some of the questions and
I'd like to share some of the questions BBC employees have to face with you, OK?
ready? We'll bring them up on the screen here.
you have a blow out on the motorway. One for you here, Hammond, what instinctive reaction should you avoid?
accelerating. Tyre's gone, eeeeee...
this is instinctive reactions?
taking your hands off the steering wheel?
well, that'll help.
they're just maniacs, they're just...I'm so irritated by this I can't believe it, and then
exceeding the speed limit in a built-up area is acceptable in vehicles fitted with anti-lock braking systems.
you strongly disagree, disagree, agree or strongly agree.
it's not gonna be an excuse, is it?
Yeah, officer, it's OK, I've done 110 through the village, I have ABS.
no ticket for me.
why are you looking angry with me, officer?
what's the primary hazard facing drivers when driving at night?
anyone wanna a hazard guess of that?
hang on, this is...go on...what? Yeah? What?
dark? Anything else?
Germans.
Germans?
these are all valid points.
none of these things are on my list.
anybody else got any thoughts?
peasants.
fatigue, staying alert.
and it now means you've got to spend 20 minutes next week failing the test and then going on a course,
so I'm sorry we won't be here ladies and gentlemen next week, but we'll be much safer drivers when we get back.
now here on Top Gear as you know we like a bit of challenge, we've made amphibious cars, we've made a convertible people carrier, but now it's time to see if we can conquer the final frontier--the space.
no.
Hang...well...what do you mean no?
no.
now, you see, we wanted to find out if you could make a car into a spaceship.
Yes, and I thought this was the single stupidest idea I've ever heard in my life and refuse to have any part in it.
Ah, you see, but you underestimated the genius of our space-based plan.
one of the problems with space rocket is that they're giant expensive.
the Super Power spent billions trying to get their hardware up amongst the stars
but we thought you can do it for a lot less cash if you base your space rocket on a car.
that meant getting hold of the most rocket shaped car we can think of.
yes it's been around for 30 years, and for 29 of those years it's been a complete joke.
now though, we're gonna see if the Reliant Robin has the makings of a spaceship.
it's light, It's cheap. And it tapers to a point like a rocket.
so we're already heading in the right direction.
but we're not just gonna strap rockets to it, set it off and wave it good-bye.
because we're gonna see if we can turn it into the most difficult of all space craft.
the one has to take off, and been used again.
a space shuttle.
if you're eight, you're probably gonna wanna see what happens next.
our first job had been to put a call-in to the rocketeers.
these were the men who'd helped to send a Mini down the skee jump for the Top Gear Winter Olympics ...Two One Initiate
James and I convened a meeting at their headquarters, just out side the Derbyshire Town of Glossop.
it's not exactly the Kennedy Space Centre, is it?
Oh, I don't know.
inside we'd assembled a /mockly crew of boffins.
right, gentlemen, what we want from you is the most difficult type of space rocket
a ... space shuttle
this has to work properly, it has to have the big fuel tank it has to have the booster rocket, they all have to separate. Most importantly, we have to be able to bring it back down under control to a landing.
and it's worth say as well though. No body's gonna go in this.
Yeah. - But it has to be landed.
the idea of this is that we will send it up to a few thousand feet
what we're doing is testing the principle if you can make all this work, and we and bring it into this controllable landing
we will probably get funding from the EU for a proper space mission
so you want to launch it?
jettison the SRBs - Jettison the SRBs - Jettison the orbiter, and fly it down?
what's the orbiter?
the Reliant - Right
have you got a spare billion dollars?
no, you see that's why we've come to you.
because you're from Manchester and you'll be able to do it for ten and six
and as much teas as you can drink while you do're doing that.
Yeah, chips and lard, everything, anything you want.
the rocket men did some calculations on the back of a laptop.
how do you make the bloody thing work?
well we've got the Robin. They've given us a Robin now. That's it's started, right.
whoopee, whoopee, whoopee, we've got a Robin.
an hour later, and it looks as though Jeremy might have had a point.
it is difficult in every single way.
right.
you've got a Reliant Robin, It's a car. So it should really really heavy.
Yeah.
so, rough numbers were we're gonna need about 12 times enough power than the Mini had.
Really?
it's the largest non-commercial rocket launched in Europe.
it's the most powerful non-commercial rocket launched in Europe.
right.
as a rocket, it is the most awful shape it could ever be.
but I thought the Robin was a good place to start, because it's pointy at one end.
that's as far as I've got with that.
it's pointy, Yeah.
never the less they set to work with James in tow.
while May was in his element in world's biggest lockram shed
Oh, look at that.
I was trying to work out how to land the Reliant Robin.
the rockets have deployed, Err. so we land it...like that.
I wrestled with the problem for ages before I had a brain wave.
hello is that Model Airplane Monthly? Great, Em. I need some help.
this I think is the answer.
we put a more powerful version of whatever this is to our space shuttle.
then we can take control of it from the ground after its jettison in this rocket and...
flied in by remote, it's a good plan. Just got to get good to fly it.
I thought it best to sack myself from this job and instead hired Steve Holland
a champion model air plane pilot.
Yeah, now that is more like it, this.
how are you at flying cars? - Cars?
cars, small cars.
with Steve the pilot onboard I went back to check on James' build and I was in for a shock.
deep hell James, it's enormous.
that's a solid rocket booster, there are two of those.
that hasn't even got its nose cone on yet, it's actually a bit bigger than that.
but it's...I was thinking firework on a stick
I know. So was I, but that isn't the biggest bit.
no, the external fuel tank was the biggest bit
complete with extra rockets in the bottom
then there were more rockets in the Reliant.
and explosive bolts to separate every thing.
the whole construction was mind bombingly complicated.
what occurs to me now is the list of things to go wrong.
it's enormous.
Yeah.
and if anyone of them goes wrong
see I've been worried about the landing.
the chance of getting as far as the landing on the day are now...
how did you get on with your flying, by the way.
Err.Good.
the next problem was a biggie.
the rocketeers were worried that because of the Robin's odd shape
the whole shuttle will spear off course during the ascent.
so we are happy we've got the power.
Yeah, eight tons of thrust.
and the thing only weights 1. 5, so it's gonna go, someway.
it's not gonna work, is it?
well it's got to work, we're quite a long way into it now. - Hehe. What's that?
Yeah, now now, but you see, look at it like this, it makes a lot more sense.
may we gotta make sure it doesn't just launch I mean it can't...
it could fall onto its back in the sky or anything
this isn't about power now. This is about the shape of it.
and now that would affect...where it goes. - Yeah...where it goes.
it's air dynamic, we need an air dynamic's expert to look at all the stuff.
one groveling phone call to the University of the West of England.
and we secured permission to use their wind tunnel.
and because it was free, We assumed it was self-service.
go
well? What do you mean go...I don't know what...
err.
do that.
that's good!
no matter how hard he tried, James couldn't make himself into the shape of a Reliant Robin. Even with help.
thankfully, two eggheads arrived with a scale model of our shuttle.
you see a beard like that, and you know you're in safe hands. - Yep.
basically We're looking for anything air dynamic than...
nasty?
Yeah, the Reliant is a proper mal-air dynamical thing.
well they didn't really design it with this in mind, did they.
is there any washout or washin on the winds?
Basically.simple.the air force
I don't know what you two are saying.
well this is the air force actually doing...
done.
alright.
so, the big question, will it fly?
I took it from his silence that he had his doubts.
and it wasn't alone.
like the real thing our shuttle would glide back to earth without power.
and Steve our pilot had also built a model to show how well it did this.
what it actually gonna feel like to fly do you think?
it's gonna come down like a lift with a cable cut.
you're not filling me with hope, Steve.
well, most normal air plane they sort of glide for about, you know, they fly 20 feet forward they lose about a foot in height.
afraid the Robin is the other way round.
and when the model was released from its tow plane...
it's just plummeting to the earth!
I'd rather you than me, I tell you.
so, there were doubts about our space shuttle going up, and doubts about it coming down.
but it was too late to worry now. Because she was ready, and on her way to the launch site.
don't worry, I still like cars, I promise
Ah, anyway, we'll pick up their ludicrous story later on
but now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car
my guest tonight is the hero of a new American Hollywood action film
that's set in a sleepy British village sort of die hard beat.
anyway here he is, Simon Pegg.
how are you?
good to see you. Have a seat.
thank you very much.
a super star...
now um, I got to say, we don't really do plugging very much on this show
yeah not very good at it, and also like to say how it is, you know?
you keep it real.
if some wobbler comes with a new record that's terrible we got to say "Your record is terrible
but your new film "HOT FUZZ," man that's funny
good
now as far as I could work out, the idea is to make British cops cool, is that right?
Yeah, we just thought every...that...
there'd been a big sort of tradition of of like British films being about the gangsters and being about the crime sort of world, because it's easier to make them look cool cuz they've got shooters and stuff, you know?
whereas the British cops have got...it's slightly against them in terms of their cool. It is a very traditional force, you know the uniform is only just starting to get practical and so it's hard to be cool and a British cop.
um
and the one thing that was difficult for our police force in terms of the coolometer is the pointy tall hat which pregnant women are still allowed to wee in.
if they are caught short in the town centre
you are allowed to wee in the policeman's hat?
absolutely, if you're pregnant.
Oh I can claim that.
come here officer, oh, thanks a lot mate.
now, so that people could know what we're on about
I've actually made sure we've got a clip for this film, OK?
Oh good.
and it's a bit in the supermarket.
Yes.
when they have, you have a gun fight.
we do, in the battle of somerfields.
the battle of som... So let's have a look at that.
what are you thinking?
well, this is straight now, we've got the element of surprise, not gonna wait more time for them to get mobilise.
I say we go in through the front entrance, take the place all by awe they won't be expecting that.
very good, what he said.
my my, here come the fuzz.
maybe they are not here?
wait here.
don't go in on your own. - Don't worry, he knows what he is doing.
OK, They're in, you deal with the store, I'll deal with the trolley boy.
aye?
Oh, shi...
Oh...
it is, it is marvelous there.
first question we got to ask is
did somerfields let you do that or did you just go and?
Yeah, they did...I...I...you know I've got maximum respect for somerfields now.
Because...we...you know, we wrote them a letter and said "Look, we're gonna have a big fight in one of your supermarkets if you don't mind.
it's all in good fun, it's meant you know...with a grammar of affection.
and they were like "Alright."
and the other one of course we've got to get onto car chases.
Yeah.
again the American car tends to be rear wheel drive, police chase.
you used Astra diesels.
nothing but the best well that's what the...you know, a lot of uh...of the police are kinda lumbered with and because actually the chase is uh...is is... it's another Astra diesel in the chase it's like fire and ice, that chase would never end until the fuel run out do you know what I mean? Cuz there is no...
it's two Astras chasing each other.
it's like the unmovable force and the unstoppable object.
the other awful thing of course about the Astra diesel is you know those "World's wildest police chase video" thing?
Yeah.
I once watched one of those in America.
they said we got a clip from England and I thought "I'm just gonna die of shame
and sure enough it went around the corner on a housing estate and bumped into a plant pot and there is your...
you say you had some driver training for the film, did you have gun training as well?
Ah, we did a couple of days.
I was pretty professional anyway.
are you a gun man?
I've got a bunch of weapons...I...I...I "pack heat."
we had some amazing days of just whole days running through Wales town centre firing of Winchester 1300M pump action shotguns - 1300M? - it's a lovely weapon. - Yeah
I like the way you throw the modern name in there.
Nick Frost calls it...he...he called it Emma, he was that attached to it.
and when we were doing space, he had to dismantle a gun uh... for the show so he took a replica MP5 gun which was a machine gun, um... took all his clothes off, no, he...stripped to the waist, it was summer time, he put a blindfold on and was kinda doing this, took the blindfold off to check the watch and there were 8 armed police officers in the living room with their guns drawn like you know...and they made the decision that if Nick went like that as opposed to that which is what I did - they were gonna shoot him. - Really?
Yep, and he phoned me afterwards "Simon, they...
he said, apparently he was going "I'm...I'm...I'm an actor! I'm an actor!
and they were all like "where's your equity card?
they've changed the role and you don't need one anymore.
now, can I just move on, cuz films, you're a bit of a buff, I gather.
I am a bit.
Starwars in particular. - Yeah, absolutely.
did you not once write a 3500 word essay on why you thought C-3PO was gay?
Hahaha, no no, that was a part of the... what I wrote was... I did it...
I analyzed Star Wars from a Marx's perspective in terms of saying...
well that was the idea that I never lost the things in the Star Wars that are pretty right wing
it came after Vietnam.
it was a big expression of the American white middle class power in the rejection of the old order of the English and you could argue that C-3PO was kind of musculated homosexual.
I don't... - Cuz he's very camp but he was safe, coz he didn't have a "willy."
so it was ok. He was...
homosexual men have "willies"?
he was sexually non threatening.
Graham Norton's got a willy.
how do you know?
do you know, I must admit, when I was doing my lap, uh...I...I...was just wishing I could hear the Stig like Ben Kenobi.
Yes.
you know, I mean "Slower on the corner, Simon, slower on the corner."
anyway, listen, who would like to see Simon's lap?
OK let's have a look at this.
good speech.
that's good.
nice, slight wheel spin.
that's kinda my job, actually, that. The commentry on what the car's like.
Oh yeah.
that was pleasant. It's very pleasant.
Pleasant's not a word I've ever used...look at that!
that was my favourite bend, that one.
why did you...it was so good you just kept it going.
%...& gear you bugger.
I heard, a leap from Hugh Grant there from a couple of weeks ago.
and nice.
this is good.
help!
that's the first cry for help we've had.
this was...that was so much fun.
I've just seen you mi...
God if you can nail this one, you're laughing.
look at those eyes. No, where's the speed gone?
I know, that was my worst corner.
no, oh you've slowed down.
I know I know, what was I... - Oh crossed the line there. That was fast.
that was alright.
that's the adrenalin going.
it really really does, so much fun.
where do you think you've come?
I'd hope for kinda upper middle, but I hope above Coogan, please.
above Coogan?
you did it in 1 minute... you're above Jimmy Carr,
Yeah.
forty...so already you are above Coogan 8. 5, so way above Coogan, nice one.
thank you.
I think if I nailed that corner, if I... that was the one that bothered me
I reckon if you'd have done those last 2 corners at sort of Michael Gambon speed for instance, you would have been up there honestly with Gordon Ramsey.
Yeah.
that was a very good lap.
it felt really great.
well, listen, best of luck with the film and thank you very much for coming, ladies and gentlemen, Simon Pegg!
thank you, thank you very much.
now, in the olden days it was terribly easy to tune up a mass produced car.
you put a bigger carburetor on it.
you made an airscrew for the bonnet at the apply word.
and the way you went.
these days though, it not quite so easy.
no, and it's especially tricky if you start out something like this Mercedes SL65.
517 horse power, V12, twin-turbo
I mean how can a tuning company possibly make this better than it already is.
and if they could what kind of a monster would you end up with?
well, you end up with this:
the most powerful convertible ever made
welcome every one to the 160 thousand pond Brabus S Bi-turbo roadster
sweet mother of God this is fast
the secret to all this speed of course is the engine
what Brabus do is take the standard Mercedes V12 and then throw almost all of it away only the cylinder block remains and even that is modified
everything else is new.
new and bigger.
the original car has 5. 5 liters. This is a 6. 3.
and the result of that is dramatic.
730 BHP.
that's more than any Bentley, it's more than any Ferrari, more than any Lamborghini even.
of course it's not actually that difficult to screws 730 horse powers from an engine.
but it is difficult to put all that power on the road.
and it's /nil impossible when the engine is churning out almost ridiculous 1000 torques.
1000 torques is what you'd use for restarting a dead planet.
it's so much that when they put the engine in a car it wouldn't move at all.
traction control just set there go 'This is impossible'
and when you turn the traction control off the rear wheel spun till the tires are burst.
as a result they've now limited it to just 811 torques, which is about what you use to power a medium sized aircraft carrier
now at this point you're probably expecting me to say that they've limited the top speed as well and I'm afraid they have.
to Amm... 219 MPH
the top speed is incredible, but the way it gets there boggles the mind
I'm now going 180
faster then the top speed of an Apache helicopter gunship
I'm running out off run way.
I suppose I ought to explain at this point that
Mercedes limit this car to 155 MPH because that's the limit of what there is components can take.
so if you're going to make it go 219 MPH those components have to be changed.
that discreet body kit therefore is not for show.
it's there to keep me on the ground, which is handy when you're doing 320 feet a second and what kind of under floor engineering does the Brabus have to keep it in check at this kind of speed.
well, put simply, It's all very big.
the breaks at the size of dustbin lids have 12 pistons each.
the tires could encompass Neptune and the speed the whole car sets lower to the road than the normal by 15 mm
so has it worked?
no, not really.
even though they've reined in the torque, there's still far too much of it.
every time you go near the throttle, even in a straight line you just get the traction control going 'Errrr. I don't know what to do!'
even if you turn the traction control off this bigger Mercedes of course, it isn't really off.
you got the breaks stabbing away, and the back tires desperately trying to control the mountain of torque.
just wasting their time.
honestly you may as well blow on an oil rig fire.
you have to develop a new technique, which is blast down the straight hard on the breaks
woo, I think I'm just made accreting the runway.
and then go very slowly.
slowly, eat the power in, steal the traction control spurning away and then
Ohhh...no, that was too much.
it's very hard work this.
and worse after a worryingly short amount of time the breaks were completely shot still at least this meant I can pull over and stop the madness
in terms of handling then this car is a nightmare it just cannot cope with the volcano under the bonnet.
there then is two and a bit tons of prove that absolute power really does corrupt absolutely
so it's rubbish.
well, we're gonna find out now by putting it on our track and that of course means handing it over to our tame racing driver.
some say that if you lick his chest it tastes exactly the same as piccalilli.
and that at this week's Brit awards he was arrested for goosing Russell Brand.
all we know is, he's called the Stig.
way you go, his tires struggling to contain all the torques
he's piling into the first corner already and mighty struggle between power traction control and the Stig
look at that! Unbelievable driving radio:"She could hear the others heart beating as if they share just one between
Stig's talking book collection getting another area in there as he bellows through Chicago not like he all that fast I gotta say look at it, lunatic of a car this thing through the Hammerhead
look you can actually see it wobbling around as the computers
look at it, struggling to try and keep it on straight and now nearly hitting the tyres up
Radio:"I love him, she said to the Elvens, I love him.
through the Follow Through he can really wind it up here, make up some lost time
but he has got to have lifted even the Stig's not that stupid.
no it just doesn't look that fast you just can't get the power on when you want to in it.
second to last corner, just holding it on the track through Gambon barely containing explosion there and cross the line
well yeah you're applauding but, ready?
an entirely predictable 1: 26. 2
and the problem is, very straight forward OK?
Mercedes spend a million ponds a day on research and development a million a day!
so they've got the best brains in the world with all the money in the world to make the standard car as good as it can be.
however, I don't think that this it the end for tuning companys Because look at the Jag here OK?
now they spent 35p designing this
make no mistake, I love it, it's beautiful but I do think that there is more power to be got out off the v8 under this bonet this is a prime candidate for someone to come along and tune it up a bit.
you're right, you're right.
and what's more we're British, we're the inventors of everything! It is time to brace ourselves, hasten unto the shed, and liberate ourselves from the abyss made dark by the lights of perverted German science.
I can really has lost it this week, but it doesn't matter because we can move on, because it's time for the Cool Wall
yes and we're beginning...
we're beginning by move all the 4-wheel-drive cars down - All of them? Why? - All of them are going down
no, hang on, why?
times have moved on Richard, 21st centry all that...
look, OK I appreciate, but not all 4x4s are driven by women round Chelsea
no, listen, I agree with you, I agree I'm sure with most people here - That 4x4s are not killing polar bear but... - Some of us are living in the country we need them you can't just move them all down the wall
car's all about pulling women...for us obviously
you know what I mean, for blokes since it's what it all about.
you're not gonna pull Socialist woman with these because they don't like them
what does that matter? I don't ... Sorry mate, you don't make any sense...
socialists women are better in bed than tory women
let me put it to you this way, OK?
I'll give you a straight choice: Vanessa Redgrave or Ann Widdecombe?
crikey, Vanessa Redgrave
there you are. And as a result they've all got to come down the board
they're not cool any more driving around in there, they're just not.
and you know what I am gonna do to celebrate this? I'm gonna buy a Range Rover - Hahaha - And I'm gonna get a V8 one, petrol
what have you got there?
this is the new Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder.
what do we think? How cool is that?
This...what? Subzero.
in the fridge, subzero, in the fridge subzero.
all wrong
hold on, hold on. Everybody with your opnions.
there is couple of the really crucial things you need to know about this car
number one, he's just bought one.
look at this
number two, I'm having the wall extended through that wall, down...to add a really really really really really seriously uncool section.
I'm afraid that is true obviously. If we buy one and we ruin the reputation of that car, which is why we put that over there
but this, the Ford GT can at last come up here, cuz I've got rid of it.
now next one, Porsche 911
it's brilliant brilliant car - But? - Even I'm not gonna argue that that's cool
this scaffolding, Kristin Scott Thomas, this is the test we have as you know
she got in there:"Why have you got scaffolding in the back?
you'll have to explain:"It's a roll cage in case I fall over and park on the roof.
in case I roll over, she's just going to get out.
why has it got a fire extinguisher?
in case we bust into flames on the race track.
honestly all the stuff in there is like her opening the glove box going, "Why have you got Dettol in here?
Woo...It's in case my eye inflection flares up again
it's going right down here.
I'll tell you what, you know if you put a cockometer at the side of the road
a what?
a cockometer, you know when you driving to villages in these days tells you your speed
if there was another one along side, like one of those thermometers outside the church.
selling you how much of a cock you look
this be right off the scale if you drove by one of those. I'm not joking.
what have you got?
now it's a Kia Cee'd - Oh, for God sake - Ahh, Yes, now, hang on. - I'm losing the will to live. I'll die.
does anybody here think that's cool?
absolute rubbish. - Have you driven one?
no one want one.
no. Yes? - No.
does anyone say yes?
Yes, there's a lady here saying yes. - You've driven a Kia Cee'd?
I work for Kia.
on purpose or is it just like bedding them unemployment into your town?
it's a fabulous car and it's a fabulous company.
Really?
you're not helping me there. - No.
except for one tiny detail: the Koreans eat dogs
you're gonna come down one more and you don't come crying for me if you find Top Gear dog in a bap.
again it's your logic and it's frightening - It's uncool.
I'm telling you, I'm.I won the money. Come on beyond.
why have you work for Kia, have you got a TVR T-shirt on?
because TVRs are British, and they're fast, and they're subzero.
everything Kias aren't.
right
emm. This, Ducati 1098
I'm sorry what you're doing
it's a Ducati 1098 and I'd like to put it forward to go on the board
in fact, I'd like to put it in the cool...I seriously, know there is every reason why this is a very very cool bike.
it's an Italian super bike. But it isn't just technically very very clever it also looks beautiful. Ah.
don't do it again.
do not put a motorcycle... - Touched the nerve there I think
is that touched your nerve?
I may have... - Do not put a motorcycle on the board
now look what's happened.
I'm sensing disagreement from you.
run, run or you'll be a lot shorter - I'm gonna...
now, earlier on Richard Hammond and I were attempting to prove John F Clarkson wrong by turning a Reliant Robin into a space shuttle.
and when we left the action, it was all going terribly well.
the launch site was a military base whose whereabouts are a top secret.
the build began and soon the main fuel tank was assembled and attached to the launch pad.
together with the solid rocket boosters, these parts contain the 8 and half tons of rocket power that'll be taking the reliant up into the Heavens.
here's what terrifies me as it is here on that let's be honest: bit of scaffolding
yeah?
just the tiniest...you know...
eeek like that, that's Birmingham or eeek that's John o' Groats...
look it's fine, it's held down with some old concrete blocks and some straps that you use to hold furniture down in the removal van. That's perfect.
right, there must be something useful we can do somewhere.
as it happened, there was
we were sent off to dig a bunker for Steve the model airplane pilot who would glide the reliant in.
but that wasn't easy because the launch site is littered with unexploded bombs.
thank you for choosing a precision metal detector with your metal detector you can hunt for coins, relics, jewellery, gold and silver just about anywhere.
does it say bombs? - No.
James had bought his metal detector at Argos
so I got myself some serious body armour.
you've found my JCB.
I've just worked out something though now from this it only works down to a depth of about 3 inches.
as it turned out, it all went rather well ...in the main.
look what he's done.
you philistine!
finally our bunker was finished.
so that's it then, good.
with Steve now fully protected we went back to the launch site where there was good news.
bang on time for it's date with destiny, the Reliant Robin had arrived.
Huhhhh, you're alright, you're alright. - Keep it coming.
alright. - On that line.
you're alright, you're alright. - Yeah.
back. - Nice and stop.
that is the business end of a reusable Reliant orbiter.
Wow.
then we were entrusted with another job.
I reveal to you the legend.
you spanner.
what? That 's where it goes on the wing...
but think what it's gonna look like when it's up there pointing upwards. - Brilliant.
up side down!
as night fell, the most delicate and risky part of the operation began
attaching the reliant space orbiter to the rockets and fuel tank.
not kidding, this bit is genuinely very scary because as they're mounting it, often it's quite complicated on the linkages if the shuttle clogs it and bends any of the release mechanisms, - it won't come off and then the shuttle and the tank will come down and ... - Yeah.
shall we go over and help?
I think not.
thinking about the really unNASA thing you said just now. - What?
right, come on lads, let's get this Robin plugged...
worker: Oh, ladder's coming out.
again, at NASA they don't keep a step ladder on the launch pad.
one small step ladder for... - Hahahaha...
James...stop laughing, they get nearly crossed...
finally, the Robin was attached and the completed shuttle made for a truly awesome sight.
everything was looking good.
but later in our suite at the local "Ridge Sheraton" I was worried mad.
Hammond? - What?
what do you think of the chances of it actually working?
it'll work.
it's just that you know when we do these big things they usually end in some sort of massive disaster
I quite like this one to work.
well it's up, it's built, but it's worth a quick reminder of exactly what is going to happen.
absolutely, we've got 8 and half tons of rocket thrust to push that thing off the ground at about 1000 feet the 2 solid rocket boosters will be empty they will fall away and come down on the parachutes doing about 100 miles an hour then.
Yeah, it'll continue accelerating to about 140, then at about 3000 feet
the orbiter itself will detach from the main body that's when Steve the pilot takes control it's his job to glide it in, he has the option of firing 3 rockets to extend that glide he'll then put it down on the deck of the landing strip and prove that it is a reusable craft.
Yeah. - Of course
all that we've just said is... just words.
words, yeah. - Let's be honest. Who knows.
the last few hours were taken up with final preparations and with such an ambitious project as this the complexity of the on board systems was simply staggering.
each electronic component had to talk to every other electronic component at exactly the right time.
there have been 1 or 2 delays most of these are of an electrical nature
there's a long wire leading from launch control down to the rocket and unfortunately that had a breakage some where.
James, a car ran through it.
OK, but that's all sorted. We're now fueling the bird.
and once that's done there can be no delays, it's full of fuels they're gonna have to light that candle.
Yeah.
the tension now was almost unbearable you could almost hear Jeremy preparing some intergalactic smarts.
so would it stay on course during the ascent?
would the rockets and the fuel tank detach?
and would Steve who by the way have refused our kind offer of a bunker be able to pilot the Robin down safely?
in just a few seconds, we'd know.
Oh yes!
Separate! Separate!
Separate! - 12 1000
Technicians: Break! Separate!
Oh no!
that's why... - How were you gonna use it again?
and uh...
that's enough, really.
next week these 2 completely lose touch with reality and try to get to the centre of the earth with a lawn mower.
I think we did quite well.
by what measure do you arrive at that conclusion?
well, in fair let's say there was only 1 bolt that let us down.
there's only 1 iceberg that sank the Titanic, it's still sank.
the fact of the matter is you just blew a big hole in Northumberland.
Yeah, and next week where all of us ruining Banffshire with tractors.
that's true but don't worry because I'm also driving up and down our track very fast in a Lamborghini
uh so we really hope we'll see you then, take care. Goodnight!
tonight, one small stumble for man as we build a space-shuttle
I drive a nuclear bomb disguised in a Mercedes
and Simon Pegg makes a "Hot Fuzz" in our reasonably priced car
help!
you're wrong, you're wrong.
hello and welcome to an argument
you see, there are two types of petrol head
you've got idiots like this who like the Porsche 911
and you got people like me who'd rather have anthrax than a 911 cause I'm a Ferrari-person
Yes. But when you actually owned a Ferrari you couldn't leave it parked on the street, go have a dinner really or anything cause you'd spend the whole meal worrying about who is bumping into it or carving their names into its precious painting
that's true. I once left the roof off, it was so full of phlegm when I got back.
you could've swam home, but
exactly, and therefore as a result of that it'd spend its entire life carrying in your home or your garage
and when you are eventually brave enough to wanna use it by that time, the battery was flat. It was hopeless.
Yes, I know. But a Ferrari with a flat-battery is an aesthetic thing
you could enjoy looking at it. That's the...
Yes, but it's not moving
that's why I love the 911 because you can use it everyday to go to places
it's a car!
and now there is a new turbo version which we asked him to drive and hope he'd see the light
this is the biggest 911-turbo they've ever made, but it's still no longer than a Toyota Prius, no wider than a 3-series BMW
and unlike a normal super car, it doesn't have Marilyn Monroe hips, so it doesn't get stuck in multi-storey car parks
what's more, it's not like threading through traffic in a post box, in a Ferrari, you can't really see where the buses are, so you got problem up but in this, you can
in a Ferrari, you'd be forever worried about scrunching the nose on a speed hump but not in a 911
and it doesn't even harm the sky very much either
it may have a flat-6 twin turbo engine but it only produces 300 carbon dioxides that's 100 less than you'd get from the back of a Ferrari 430
if you drive this car through a really polluted city
Los Angeles, /, /, something like that the gas coming out of the exhaust pipes is less toxic than the air going into the engine and I'm not joking. That's true
this then is like a small efficient easy-to-use vacuum cleaner
I should have called it a Porsche-Dyson
and it will suck up your luggage too because unlike any other super car, its boot is easily big enough for you weekly shop
there is the peach and peacock the corner stone of any Porsche driver's Sunday lunch and there's still room left over for the ice-cream made from the bones of you defeated squash opponent.
and you can use this car on a school run because it has back seats. I mean obviously，you'd have to have fairly thin children but then you would have because you've got a Porsche 911
so you'd have a thin wife
I'll conceive then there is no everyday situation that flummoxes a 911 turbo
and so because you can use it everyday its battery won't be flat when the moment is right and you'll fancy your drive
the new 911-turbo has special variable vane turbochargers that always work, whatever the rev is.
you could even buy a special over boost facility which for brief moments can deliver 500 torques that gives you the very muscly feel
and it got a special new Four-Wheel-Drive system that it doesn't allow any form of under or over steer
you just get so much grip that your eyes start to hurt like being in a capsule of speed
so, when the sun goes down you could really get cracking
OK. Let's engage the stability management program and put it in sport mode that changes things a bit
now every time I turn the steering wheel, it feels like I'm drawing a line through the laws of physics
this is not driving, this is pure math
so how does it compare to my beloved Ferrari
well, it has a smaller engine but because of the scram jet turbochargers it produces 480 BHP exactly what you get from a 430
but then this is lighter than the Ferrari thanks to aluminum doors which weigh just 11 Kg each
it's also 20, 000 pounds less expensive
sure, it isn't as exiting as the Ferrari it's more about engineering than passion but I would admit the end results are astonishing
let me give you some performance figures 0-60 3. 9 sec
top speed, near as makes no difference, 200 miles an hour and this is my favourite, OK? 40-60 in 2nd gear, 1 sec 1!
it's amazing because it's not just more usable than a Ferrari more practical
but I think out here in the real world with crests and dips and bumps and blind browse
I think it's faster as well
I really do
now, you see
ladies and gentlemen we must all rejoice because Clarkson has finally caught the bug
I still prefer the Ferrari
well, hang on. You've just spend the last 6 minutes wasting our time telling us that's faster, more powerful, lighter and more practical
and cheaper. The thing is, now, I'm sorry that's like sitting in a Volkswagon beetle with mustard up its bottom
well, it's better than sitting there in a car that won't start but just looks a bit pretty.
look, can we just... Can I say this argument has been going on for 40 years
it will go on for another 40 years. The correct place is in the pub
so we will do the news
no. Cause I've just thought of something else. OK?
it's really simple. It's all to do with I have passion for the Ferrari. I respect that but I have pass...
it's like David Atombra
I respect David Atombra and we just infinitely respect in the same way we respect that car but I have no passion for him. I don't wanna make love to him
but I have respect and passion for the 911
there you are. You've just admit on TV you wanna make love to David Atombra
he has just said that.
your logic sometimes, mate, is the most / thing...
shut up!
OK? We should do the news. - Right.
and now the news. And we begin this week with...
with the Porsche 911
more specifically the Porsche 911 GT3 RS
Oh now, that's the business.
it's faster, it's lighter, it's tauter, it's possibly the ultimate 911
in the same way the Ebola is the ultimate tropical disease.
what's with all that scaffolding in there?
it's a roll cage for when you take it on the race track
I'm sorry. If I see scaffolding around a building, I don't think that one's finished.
I'm sorry, actually they're unfinished.
no, it's a roll cage.
look, I'll admit this is perhaps the only problem with this otherwise brilliant car is that it's not the most practical
if you wanna pop down to the newspaper shop, you've gotta clamber in over the roll cage, lower yourself into the bucket seat, do up the 6-point race harness, prime the fire extinguisher system, it's gonna take time.
so in the real world, my 1. 2 Liter fiat panda is faster to the shops - No, mate, it's just not... - I only have to put the seat belt on once,
you've got to do it 6 times.
OK. I've got to do that and then wait while you put you seat belts on and then do all your pre-flight checks make sure the air vents are working...
can I just move this along? Do you mind? Is that alright?
cuz I've got something that's really bugging me.
has anyone seem these average speed cameras they are kicking around now?
do you know what I mean?
so you've got to do... I was xxx the M25 the other day, through the road works, had to do an average of 40 miles/h measured by 2 cameras, 1 at the beginning 1 at the end.
that's impossible
it's impossible because you're driving along and you sort of looking around and oh god, I'm doing 42 cuz I'm doing down hill
you think that I've been doing that for half a mile so I need to do half a mile at 38
which means you could only look at the speedometer
you can't look at anything else only the speedometer
you're going through road works in a m25 in the rain in rash hour.
and I know what they're doing here. It's the government.
gordon Brown has worked out that he's got to pay all our pensions cuz we're gonna live for ever.
they are trying to kill us off.
I know how to get round it, OK? Go pass the first camera, pull over, get the newspaper out, read it, listen to the radio for 10 mins.
do 120 for the rest way of it.
that's not quite wrong actually.
cuz I can prove that the way to keep traffic moving through the road works which is where those average cameras are is for everybody to go faster from the start.
Yeah. - It's all down to the work of the Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli. You're familiar with him?
Oh, him.
thought so. - He isn't.
he is.
he's never heard of him.
but what he essentially proved was that in a system, the pressure and the volume multiplied together must be a constant, so if you've got a busy motor way and it gets thinner, there's less space for the cars to go through they must go faster for the flow rate of cars to remain the same.
so it's like when you put your thumb over the end of a hose pipe, the water comes out quicker.
that's exactly what it's like, yeah.
so how fast then if you take 3-lane motorway down to 1 lane?
how fast does the traffic have to move in order to keep the flow rate the same?
well the formula would be Vn=Lo/LrVe
so how fast?
it's 210
210 miles/h. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen - Fair enough.
all go and buy Bugattis and Zondas to cure congestion.
of course the big news this week that's been occupying all the bulletins is that 1. 5 million people have signed this petition protesting about the plans to implement road charging, pay-as-you-go stuff.
now if you want to add your name to that petition here is the address
that's the address, now obviously, this being the BBC if you think road pricing is a good idea and you want to register you thoughts on that
this is the website too. There it is.
and best of luck with that.
the Mitsubishi Evo, we love that car, it's a great car, isn't it?
well this is the new one, the Evo 10, this is what it's probably gonna look like, um they've loaded it with loads of technology again, it's got all these initials, ACED, AYC, ASC, SAWC, MIVEC
good, yeah, keep talking like that... If that's got all the technologies, - I mean, really road-crushing technology. -It had to be there.
and it looks as good as that.
suddenly, why do you need super cars? - Yeah, why do you? Cuz...
it looks like that and goes as well as it could, there is a slight warning associated with those cars there, because of all that technology, I mean when they really do, they're gonna be unflattering to drive, like one of those automatic pianos where you play it and you take your hands off and it carries on playing there's a danger the cars are like that.
if you get passengers with you and they are looking at you admiringly thinking:
wow what a brilliant driver, you're excellent!
don't take your hands off the wheel...cuz...
it will keep going. - Then you'll look like an idiot.
and now, a couple of time, recently on the program, we've said that there'll never be a car to beat the Bugatti Veyron in our life time, it's the ultimate expression of the automotive engineering, and will be for some time.
turns out, we might have been wrong, because look at this.
this is called the melling hell cat got some figures for you it's got a 6 liter quad-turbo V10, 1175 brake horse power, and the top speed they're saying of 270 miles an hour.
Oh rubbish. - What?
that's rubbish. I bet you that's not slippery enough.
you mean not aerodynamic enough? - Yeah.
can you please not ask me to be the one to find out. I just don't fancy it.
Hey, last week, did you see the American program last week?
you know we got into a spot of bothering a petrol station in Alabama?
turned out we missed the trick.
cuz you know when that woman came out and she said "Are you gay or looking to get beat up in a hip town or what?
and I said "Oh no no, actually I'm married with 3 children."
if only you'd said "well, actually I'm married with 2 children," we could have just pointed at the bachelor boy there.
but the one with the long hair isn't.
of course they would have kicked the snot out of him.
chaps...
yeah?
news from the BBC, OK?
if you're a BBC employee and you drive flea cars or hired cars, you've now got to go on a safe-driving program.
but we drive though, do we have to...?
we do, yes we do.
no way.
I'm absolutely not kidding.
it says here that uh... BBC... driving is now acknowledged as one of the most serious work related health and safety issues.
it isn't.
it's just something that's more comfortable than walking.
Yes. - And then it goes on, the BBC committed in reducing the risk associated with this activity.
they're making it sound like masturbation.
stop driving or go blind.
exactly.
this is...just... I've got some of the questions and
I'd like to share some of the questions BBC employees have to face with you, OK?
ready? We'll bring them up on the screen here.
you have a blow out on the motorway. One for you here, Hammond, what instinctive reaction should you avoid?
accelerating. Tyre's gone, eeeeee...
this is instinctive reactions?
taking your hands off the steering wheel?
well, that'll help.
they're just maniacs, they're just...I'm so irritated by this I can't believe it, and then
exceeding the speed limit in a built-up area is acceptable in vehicles fitted with anti-lock braking systems.
you strongly disagree, disagree, agree or strongly agree.
it's not gonna be an excuse, is it?
Yeah, officer, it's OK, I've done 110 through the village, I have ABS.
no ticket for me.
why are you looking angry with me, officer?
what's the primary hazard facing drivers when driving at night?
anyone wanna a hazard guess of that?
hang on, this is...go on...what? Yeah? What?
dark? Anything else?
Germans.
Germans?
these are all valid points.
none of these things are on my list.
anybody else got any thoughts?
peasants.
fatigue, staying alert.
and it now means you've got to spend 20 minutes next week failing the test and then going on a course,
so I'm sorry we won't be here ladies and gentlemen next week, but we'll be much safer drivers when we get back.
now here on Top Gear as you know we like a bit of challenge, we've made amphibious cars, we've made a convertible people carrier, but now it's time to see if we can conquer the final frontier--the space.
no.
Hang...well...what do you mean no?
no.
now, you see, we wanted to find out if you could make a car into a spaceship.
Yes, and I thought this was the single stupidest idea I've ever heard in my life and refuse to have any part in it.
Ah, you see, but you underestimated the genius of our space-based plan.
one of the problems with space rocket is that they're giant expensive.
the Super Power spent billions trying to get their hardware up amongst the stars
but we thought you can do it for a lot less cash if you base your space rocket on a car.
that meant getting hold of the most rocket shaped car we can think of.
yes it's been around for 30 years, and for 29 of those years it's been a complete joke.
now though, we're gonna see if the Reliant Robin has the makings of a spaceship.
it's light, It's cheap. And it tapers to a point like a rocket.
so we're already heading in the right direction.
but we're not just gonna strap rockets to it, set it off and wave it good-bye.
because we're gonna see if we can turn it into the most difficult of all space craft.
the one has to take off, and been used again.
a space shuttle.
if you're eight, you're probably gonna wanna see what happens next.
our first job had been to put a call-in to the rocketeers.
these were the men who'd helped to send a Mini down the skee jump for the Top Gear Winter Olympics ...Two One Initiate
James and I convened a meeting at their headquarters, just out side the Derbyshire Town of Glossop.
it's not exactly the Kennedy Space Centre, is it?
Oh, I don't know.
inside we'd assembled a /mockly crew of boffins.
right, gentlemen, what we want from you is the most difficult type of space rocket
a ... space shuttle
this has to work properly, it has to have the big fuel tank it has to have the booster rocket, they all have to separate. Most importantly, we have to be able to bring it back down under control to a landing.
and it's worth say as well though. No body's gonna go in this.
Yeah. - But it has to be landed.
the idea of this is that we will send it up to a few thousand feet
what we're doing is testing the principle if you can make all this work, and we and bring it into this controllable landing
we will probably get funding from the EU for a proper space mission
so you want to launch it?
jettison the SRBs - Jettison the SRBs - Jettison the orbiter, and fly it down?
what's the orbiter?
the Reliant - Right
have you got a spare billion dollars?
no, you see that's why we've come to you.
because you're from Manchester and you'll be able to do it for ten and six
and as much teas as you can drink while you do're doing that.
Yeah, chips and lard, everything, anything you want.
the rocket men did some calculations on the back of a laptop.
how do you make the bloody thing work?
well we've got the Robin. They've given us a Robin now. That's it's started, right.
whoopee, whoopee, whoopee, we've got a Robin.
an hour later, and it looks as though Jeremy might have had a point.
it is difficult in every single way.
right.
you've got a Reliant Robin, It's a car. So it should really really heavy.
Yeah.
so, rough numbers were we're gonna need about 12 times enough power than the Mini had.
Really?
it's the largest non-commercial rocket launched in Europe.
it's the most powerful non-commercial rocket launched in Europe.
right.
as a rocket, it is the most awful shape it could ever be.
but I thought the Robin was a good place to start, because it's pointy at one end.
that's as far as I've got with that.
it's pointy, Yeah.
never the less they set to work with James in tow.
while May was in his element in world's biggest lockram shed
Oh, look at that.
I was trying to work out how to land the Reliant Robin.
the rockets have deployed, Err. so we land it...like that.
I wrestled with the problem for ages before I had a brain wave.
hello is that Model Airplane Monthly? Great, Em. I need some help.
this I think is the answer.
we put a more powerful version of whatever this is to our space shuttle.
then we can take control of it from the ground after its jettison in this rocket and...
flied in by remote, it's a good plan. Just got to get good to fly it.
I thought it best to sack myself from this job and instead hired Steve Holland
a champion model air plane pilot.
Yeah, now that is more like it, this.
how are you at flying cars? - Cars?
cars, small cars.
with Steve the pilot onboard I went back to check on James' build and I was in for a shock.
deep hell James, it's enormous.
that's a solid rocket booster, there are two of those.
that hasn't even got its nose cone on yet, it's actually a bit bigger than that.
but it's...I was thinking firework on a stick
I know. So was I, but that isn't the biggest bit.
no, the external fuel tank was the biggest bit
complete with extra rockets in the bottom
then there were more rockets in the Reliant.
and explosive bolts to separate every thing.
the whole construction was mind bombingly complicated.
what occurs to me now is the list of things to go wrong.
it's enormous.
Yeah.
and if anyone of them goes wrong
see I've been worried about the landing.
the chance of getting as far as the landing on the day are now...
how did you get on with your flying, by the way.
Err.Good.
the next problem was a biggie.
the rocketeers were worried that because of the Robin's odd shape
the whole shuttle will spear off course during the ascent.
so we are happy we've got the power.
Yeah, eight tons of thrust.
and the thing only weights 1. 5, so it's gonna go, someway.
it's not gonna work, is it?
well it's got to work, we're quite a long way into it now. - Hehe. What's that?
Yeah, now now, but you see, look at it like this, it makes a lot more sense.
may we gotta make sure it doesn't just launch I mean it can't...
it could fall onto its back in the sky or anything
this isn't about power now. This is about the shape of it.
and now that would affect...where it goes. - Yeah...where it goes.
it's air dynamic, we need an air dynamic's expert to look at all the stuff.
one groveling phone call to the University of the West of England.
and we secured permission to use their wind tunnel.
and because it was free, We assumed it was self-service.
go
well? What do you mean go...I don't know what...
err.
do that.
that's good!
no matter how hard he tried, James couldn't make himself into the shape of a Reliant Robin. Even with help.
thankfully, two eggheads arrived with a scale model of our shuttle.
you see a beard like that, and you know you're in safe hands. - Yep.
basically We're looking for anything air dynamic than...
nasty?
Yeah, the Reliant is a proper mal-air dynamical thing.
well they didn't really design it with this in mind, did they.
is there any washout or washin on the winds?
Basically.simple.the air force
I don't know what you two are saying.
well this is the air force actually doing...
done.
alright.
so, the big question, will it fly?
I took it from his silence that he had his doubts.
and it wasn't alone.
like the real thing our shuttle would glide back to earth without power.
and Steve our pilot had also built a model to show how well it did this.
what it actually gonna feel like to fly do you think?
it's gonna come down like a lift with a cable cut.
you're not filling me with hope, Steve.
well, most normal air plane they sort of glide for about, you know, they fly 20 feet forward they lose about a foot in height.
afraid the Robin is the other way round.
and when the model was released from its tow plane...
it's just plummeting to the earth!
I'd rather you than me, I tell you.
so, there were doubts about our space shuttle going up, and doubts about it coming down.
but it was too late to worry now. Because she was ready, and on her way to the launch site.
don't worry, I still like cars, I promise
Ah, anyway, we'll pick up their ludicrous story later on
but now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car
my guest tonight is the hero of a new American Hollywood action film
that's set in a sleepy British village sort of die hard beat.
anyway here he is, Simon Pegg.
how are you?
good to see you. Have a seat.
thank you very much.
a super star...
now um, I got to say, we don't really do plugging very much on this show
yeah not very good at it, and also like to say how it is, you know?
you keep it real.
if some wobbler comes with a new record that's terrible we got to say "Your record is terrible
but your new film "HOT FUZZ," man that's funny
good
now as far as I could work out, the idea is to make British cops cool, is that right?
Yeah, we just thought every...that...
there'd been a big sort of tradition of of like British films being about the gangsters and being about the crime sort of world, because it's easier to make them look cool cuz they've got shooters and stuff, you know?
whereas the British cops have got...it's slightly against them in terms of their cool. It is a very traditional force, you know the uniform is only just starting to get practical and so it's hard to be cool and a British cop.
um
and the one thing that was difficult for our police force in terms of the coolometer is the pointy tall hat which pregnant women are still allowed to wee in.
if they are caught short in the town centre
you are allowed to wee in the policeman's hat?
absolutely, if you're pregnant.
Oh I can claim that.
come here officer, oh, thanks a lot mate.
now, so that people could know what we're on about
I've actually made sure we've got a clip for this film, OK?
Oh good.
and it's a bit in the supermarket.
Yes.
when they have, you have a gun fight.
we do, in the battle of somerfields.
the battle of som... So let's have a look at that.
what are you thinking?
well, this is straight now, we've got the element of surprise, not gonna wait more time for them to get mobilise.
I say we go in through the front entrance, take the place all by awe they won't be expecting that.
very good, what he said.
my my, here come the fuzz.
maybe they are not here?
wait here.
don't go in on your own. - Don't worry, he knows what he is doing.
OK, They're in, you deal with the store, I'll deal with the trolley boy.
aye?
Oh, shi...
Oh...
it is, it is marvelous there.
first question we got to ask is
did somerfields let you do that or did you just go and?
Yeah, they did...I...I...you know I've got maximum respect for somerfields now.
Because...we...you know, we wrote them a letter and said "Look, we're gonna have a big fight in one of your supermarkets if you don't mind.
it's all in good fun, it's meant you know...with a grammar of affection.
and they were like "Alright."
and the other one of course we've got to get onto car chases.
Yeah.
again the American car tends to be rear wheel drive, police chase.
you used Astra diesels.
nothing but the best well that's what the...you know, a lot of uh...of the police are kinda lumbered with and because actually the chase is uh...is is... it's another Astra diesel in the chase it's like fire and ice, that chase would never end until the fuel run out do you know what I mean? Cuz there is no...
it's two Astras chasing each other.
it's like the unmovable force and the unstoppable object.
the other awful thing of course about the Astra diesel is you know those "World's wildest police chase video" thing?
Yeah.
I once watched one of those in America.
they said we got a clip from England and I thought "I'm just gonna die of shame
and sure enough it went around the corner on a housing estate and bumped into a plant pot and there is your...
you say you had some driver training for the film, did you have gun training as well?
Ah, we did a couple of days.
I was pretty professional anyway.
are you a gun man?
I've got a bunch of weapons...I...I...I "pack heat."
we had some amazing days of just whole days running through Wales town centre firing of Winchester 1300M pump action shotguns - 1300M? - it's a lovely weapon. - Yeah
I like the way you throw the modern name in there.
Nick Frost calls it...he...he called it Emma, he was that attached to it.
and when we were doing space, he had to dismantle a gun uh... for the show so he took a replica MP5 gun which was a machine gun, um... took all his clothes off, no, he...stripped to the waist, it was summer time, he put a blindfold on and was kinda doing this, took the blindfold off to check the watch and there were 8 armed police officers in the living room with their guns drawn like you know...and they made the decision that if Nick went like that as opposed to that which is what I did - they were gonna shoot him. - Really?
Yep, and he phoned me afterwards "Simon, they...
he said, apparently he was going "I'm...I'm...I'm an actor! I'm an actor!
and they were all like "where's your equity card?
they've changed the role and you don't need one anymore.
now, can I just move on, cuz films, you're a bit of a buff, I gather.
I am a bit.
Starwars in particular. - Yeah, absolutely.
did you not once write a 3500 word essay on why you thought C-3PO was gay?
Hahaha, no no, that was a part of the... what I wrote was... I did it...
I analyzed Star Wars from a Marx's perspective in terms of saying...
well that was the idea that I never lost the things in the Star Wars that are pretty right wing
it came after Vietnam.
it was a big expression of the American white middle class power in the rejection of the old order of the English and you could argue that C-3PO was kind of musculated homosexual.
I don't... - Cuz he's very camp but he was safe, coz he didn't have a "willy."
so it was ok. He was...
homosexual men have "willies"?
he was sexually non threatening.
Graham Norton's got a willy.
how do you know?
do you know, I must admit, when I was doing my lap, uh...I...I...was just wishing I could hear the Stig like Ben Kenobi.
Yes.
you know, I mean "Slower on the corner, Simon, slower on the corner."
anyway, listen, who would like to see Simon's lap?
OK let's have a look at this.
good speech.
that's good.
nice, slight wheel spin.
that's kinda my job, actually, that. The commentry on what the car's like.
Oh yeah.
that was pleasant. It's very pleasant.
Pleasant's not a word I've ever used...look at that!
that was my favourite bend, that one.
why did you...it was so good you just kept it going.
%...& gear you bugger.
I heard, a leap from Hugh Grant there from a couple of weeks ago.
and nice.
this is good.
help!
that's the first cry for help we've had.
this was...that was so much fun.
I've just seen you mi...
God if you can nail this one, you're laughing.
look at those eyes. No, where's the speed gone?
I know, that was my worst corner.
no, oh you've slowed down.
I know I know, what was I... - Oh crossed the line there. That was fast.
that was alright.
that's the adrenalin going.
it really really does, so much fun.
where do you think you've come?
I'd hope for kinda upper middle, but I hope above Coogan, please.
above Coogan?
you did it in 1 minute... you're above Jimmy Carr,
Yeah.
forty...so already you are above Coogan 8. 5, so way above Coogan, nice one.
thank you.
I think if I nailed that corner, if I... that was the one that bothered me
I reckon if you'd have done those last 2 corners at sort of Michael Gambon speed for instance, you would have been up there honestly with Gordon Ramsey.
Yeah.
that was a very good lap.
it felt really great.
well, listen, best of luck with the film and thank you very much for coming, ladies and gentlemen, Simon Pegg!
thank you, thank you very much.
now, in the olden days it was terribly easy to tune up a mass produced car.
you put a bigger carburetor on it.
you made an airscrew for the bonnet at the apply word.
and the way you went.
these days though, it not quite so easy.
no, and it's especially tricky if you start out something like this Mercedes SL65.
517 horse power, V12, twin-turbo
I mean how can a tuning company possibly make this better than it already is.
and if they could what kind of a monster would you end up with?
well, you end up with this:
the most powerful convertible ever made
welcome every one to the 160 thousand pond Brabus S Bi-turbo roadster
sweet mother of God this is fast
the secret to all this speed of course is the engine
what Brabus do is take the standard Mercedes V12 and then throw almost all of it away only the cylinder block remains and even that is modified
everything else is new.
new and bigger.
the original car has 5. 5 liters. This is a 6. 3.
and the result of that is dramatic.
730 BHP.
that's more than any Bentley, it's more than any Ferrari, more than any Lamborghini even.
of course it's not actually that difficult to screws 730 horse powers from an engine.
but it is difficult to put all that power on the road.
and it's /nil impossible when the engine is churning out almost ridiculous 1000 torques.
1000 torques is what you'd use for restarting a dead planet.
it's so much that when they put the engine in a car it wouldn't move at all.
traction control just set there go 'This is impossible'
and when you turn the traction control off the rear wheel spun till the tires are burst.
as a result they've now limited it to just 811 torques, which is about what you use to power a medium sized aircraft carrier
now at this point you're probably expecting me to say that they've limited the top speed as well and I'm afraid they have.
to Amm... 219 MPH
the top speed is incredible, but the way it gets there boggles the mind
I'm now going 180
faster then the top speed of an Apache helicopter gunship
I'm running out off run way.
I suppose I ought to explain at this point that
Mercedes limit this car to 155 MPH because that's the limit of what there is components can take.
so if you're going to make it go 219 MPH those components have to be changed.
that discreet body kit therefore is not for show.
it's there to keep me on the ground, which is handy when you're doing 320 feet a second and what kind of under floor engineering does the Brabus have to keep it in check at this kind of speed.
well, put simply, It's all very big.
the breaks at the size of dustbin lids have 12 pistons each.
the tires could encompass Neptune and the speed the whole car sets lower to the road than the normal by 15 mm
so has it worked?
no, not really.
even though they've reined in the torque, there's still far too much of it.
every time you go near the throttle, even in a straight line you just get the traction control going 'Errrr. I don't know what to do!'
even if you turn the traction control off this bigger Mercedes of course, it isn't really off.
you got the breaks stabbing away, and the back tires desperately trying to control the mountain of torque.
just wasting their time.
honestly you may as well blow on an oil rig fire.
you have to develop a new technique, which is blast down the straight hard on the breaks
woo, I think I'm just made accreting the runway.
and then go very slowly.
slowly, eat the power in, steal the traction control spurning away and then
Ohhh...no, that was too much.
it's very hard work this.
and worse after a worryingly short amount of time the breaks were completely shot still at least this meant I can pull over and stop the madness
in terms of handling then this car is a nightmare it just cannot cope with the volcano under the bonnet.
there then is two and a bit tons of prove that absolute power really does corrupt absolutely
so it's rubbish.
well, we're gonna find out now by putting it on our track and that of course means handing it over to our tame racing driver.
some say that if you lick his chest it tastes exactly the same as piccalilli.
and that at this week's Brit awards he was arrested for goosing Russell Brand.
all we know is, he's called the Stig.
way you go, his tires struggling to contain all the torques
he's piling into the first corner already and mighty struggle between power traction control and the Stig
look at that! Unbelievable driving radio:"She could hear the others heart beating as if they share just one between
Stig's talking book collection getting another area in there as he bellows through Chicago not like he all that fast I gotta say look at it, lunatic of a car this thing through the Hammerhead
look you can actually see it wobbling around as the computers
look at it, struggling to try and keep it on straight and now nearly hitting the tyres up
Radio:"I love him, she said to the Elvens, I love him.
through the Follow Through he can really wind it up here, make up some lost time
but he has got to have lifted even the Stig's not that stupid.
no it just doesn't look that fast you just can't get the power on when you want to in it.
second to last corner, just holding it on the track through Gambon barely containing explosion there and cross the line
well yeah you're applauding but, ready?
an entirely predictable 1: 26. 2
and the problem is, very straight forward OK?
Mercedes spend a million ponds a day on research and development a million a day!
so they've got the best brains in the world with all the money in the world to make the standard car as good as it can be.
however, I don't think that this it the end for tuning companys Because look at the Jag here OK?
now they spent 35p designing this
make no mistake, I love it, it's beautiful but I do think that there is more power to be got out off the v8 under this bonet this is a prime candidate for someone to come along and tune it up a bit.
you're right, you're right.
and what's more we're British, we're the inventors of everything! It is time to brace ourselves, hasten unto the shed, and liberate ourselves from the abyss made dark by the lights of perverted German science.
I can really has lost it this week, but it doesn't matter because we can move on, because it's time for the Cool Wall
yes and we're beginning...
we're beginning by move all the 4-wheel-drive cars down - All of them? Why? - All of them are going down
no, hang on, why?
times have moved on Richard, 21st centry all that...
look, OK I appreciate, but not all 4x4s are driven by women round Chelsea
no, listen, I agree with you, I agree I'm sure with most people here - That 4x4s are not killing polar bear but... - Some of us are living in the country we need them you can't just move them all down the wall
car's all about pulling women...for us obviously
you know what I mean, for blokes since it's what it all about.
you're not gonna pull Socialist woman with these because they don't like them
what does that matter? I don't ... Sorry mate, you don't make any sense...
socialists women are better in bed than tory women
let me put it to you this way, OK?
I'll give you a straight choice: Vanessa Redgrave or Ann Widdecombe?
crikey, Vanessa Redgrave
there you are. And as a result they've all got to come down the board
they're not cool any more driving around in there, they're just not.
and you know what I am gonna do to celebrate this? I'm gonna buy a Range Rover - Hahaha - And I'm gonna get a V8 one, petrol
what have you got there?
this is the new Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder.
what do we think? How cool is that?
This...what? Subzero.
in the fridge, subzero, in the fridge subzero.
all wrong
hold on, hold on. Everybody with your opnions.
there is couple of the really crucial things you need to know about this car
number one, he's just bought one.
look at this
number two, I'm having the wall extended through that wall, down...to add a really really really really really seriously uncool section.
I'm afraid that is true obviously. If we buy one and we ruin the reputation of that car, which is why we put that over there
but this, the Ford GT can at last come up here, cuz I've got rid of it.
now next one, Porsche 911
it's brilliant brilliant car - But? - Even I'm not gonna argue that that's cool
this scaffolding, Kristin Scott Thomas, this is the test we have as you know
she got in there:"Why have you got scaffolding in the back?
you'll have to explain:"It's a roll cage in case I fall over and park on the roof.
in case I roll over, she's just going to get out.
why has it got a fire extinguisher?
in case we bust into flames on the race track.
honestly all the stuff in there is like her opening the glove box going, "Why have you got Dettol in here?
Woo...It's in case my eye inflection flares up again
it's going right down here.
I'll tell you what, you know if you put a cockometer at the side of the road
a what?
a cockometer, you know when you driving to villages in these days tells you your speed
if there was another one along side, like one of those thermometers outside the church.
selling you how much of a cock you look
this be right off the scale if you drove by one of those. I'm not joking.
what have you got?
now it's a Kia Cee'd - Oh, for God sake - Ahh, Yes, now, hang on. - I'm losing the will to live. I'll die.
does anybody here think that's cool?
absolute rubbish. - Have you driven one?
no one want one.
no. Yes? - No.
does anyone say yes?
Yes, there's a lady here saying yes. - You've driven a Kia Cee'd?
I work for Kia.
on purpose or is it just like bedding them unemployment into your town?
it's a fabulous car and it's a fabulous company.
Really?
you're not helping me there. - No.
except for one tiny detail: the Koreans eat dogs
you're gonna come down one more and you don't come crying for me if you find Top Gear dog in a bap.
again it's your logic and it's frightening - It's uncool.
I'm telling you, I'm.I won the money. Come on beyond.
why have you work for Kia, have you got a TVR T-shirt on?
because TVRs are British, and they're fast, and they're subzero.
everything Kias aren't.
right
emm. This, Ducati 1098
I'm sorry what you're doing
it's a Ducati 1098 and I'd like to put it forward to go on the board
in fact, I'd like to put it in the cool...I seriously, know there is every reason why this is a very very cool bike.
it's an Italian super bike. But it isn't just technically very very clever it also looks beautiful. Ah.
don't do it again.
do not put a motorcycle... - Touched the nerve there I think
is that touched your nerve?
I may have... - Do not put a motorcycle on the board
now look what's happened.
I'm sensing disagreement from you.
run, run or you'll be a lot shorter - I'm gonna...
now, earlier on Richard Hammond and I were attempting to prove John F Clarkson wrong by turning a Reliant Robin into a space shuttle.
and when we left the action, it was all going terribly well.
the launch site was a military base whose whereabouts are a top secret.
the build began and soon the main fuel tank was assembled and attached to the launch pad.
together with the solid rocket boosters, these parts contain the 8 and half tons of rocket power that'll be taking the reliant up into the Heavens.
here's what terrifies me as it is here on that let's be honest: bit of scaffolding
yeah?
just the tiniest...you know...
eeek like that, that's Birmingham or eeek that's John o' Groats...
look it's fine, it's held down with some old concrete blocks and some straps that you use to hold furniture down in the removal van. That's perfect.
right, there must be something useful we can do somewhere.
as it happened, there was
we were sent off to dig a bunker for Steve the model airplane pilot who would glide the reliant in.
but that wasn't easy because the launch site is littered with unexploded bombs.
thank you for choosing a precision metal detector with your metal detector you can hunt for coins, relics, jewellery, gold and silver just about anywhere.
does it say bombs? - No.
James had bought his metal detector at Argos
so I got myself some serious body armour.
you've found my JCB.
I've just worked out something though now from this it only works down to a depth of about 3 inches.
as it turned out, it all went rather well ...in the main.
look what he's done.
you philistine!
finally our bunker was finished.
so that's it then, good.
with Steve now fully protected we went back to the launch site where there was good news.
bang on time for it's date with destiny, the Reliant Robin had arrived.
Huhhhh, you're alright, you're alright. - Keep it coming.
alright. - On that line.
you're alright, you're alright. - Yeah.
back. - Nice and stop.
that is the business end of a reusable Reliant orbiter.
Wow.
then we were entrusted with another job.
I reveal to you the legend.
you spanner.
what? That 's where it goes on the wing...
but think what it's gonna look like when it's up there pointing upwards. - Brilliant.
up side down!
as night fell, the most delicate and risky part of the operation began
attaching the reliant space orbiter to the rockets and fuel tank.
not kidding, this bit is genuinely very scary because as they're mounting it, often it's quite complicated on the linkages if the shuttle clogs it and bends any of the release mechanisms, - it won't come off and then the shuttle and the tank will come down and ... - Yeah.
shall we go over and help?
I think not.
thinking about the really unNASA thing you said just now. - What?
right, come on lads, let's get this Robin plugged...
worker: Oh, ladder's coming out.
again, at NASA they don't keep a step ladder on the launch pad.
one small step ladder for... - Hahahaha...
James...stop laughing, they get nearly crossed...
finally, the Robin was attached and the completed shuttle made for a truly awesome sight.
everything was looking good.
but later in our suite at the local "Ridge Sheraton" I was worried mad.
Hammond? - What?
what do you think of the chances of it actually working?
it'll work.
it's just that you know when we do these big things they usually end in some sort of massive disaster
I quite like this one to work.
well it's up, it's built, but it's worth a quick reminder of exactly what is going to happen.
absolutely, we've got 8 and half tons of rocket thrust to push that thing off the ground at about 1000 feet the 2 solid rocket boosters will be empty they will fall away and come down on the parachutes doing about 100 miles an hour then.
Yeah, it'll continue accelerating to about 140, then at about 3000 feet
the orbiter itself will detach from the main body that's when Steve the pilot takes control it's his job to glide it in, he has the option of firing 3 rockets to extend that glide he'll then put it down on the deck of the landing strip and prove that it is a reusable craft.
Yeah. - Of course
all that we've just said is... just words.
words, yeah. - Let's be honest. Who knows.
the last few hours were taken up with final preparations and with such an ambitious project as this the complexity of the on board systems was simply staggering.
each electronic component had to talk to every other electronic component at exactly the right time.
there have been 1 or 2 delays most of these are of an electrical nature
there's a long wire leading from launch control down to the rocket and unfortunately that had a breakage some where.
James, a car ran through it.
OK, but that's all sorted. We're now fueling the bird.
and once that's done there can be no delays, it's full of fuels they're gonna have to light that candle.
Yeah.
the tension now was almost unbearable you could almost hear Jeremy preparing some intergalactic smarts.
so would it stay on course during the ascent?
would the rockets and the fuel tank detach?
and would Steve who by the way have refused our kind offer of a bunker be able to pilot the Robin down safely?
in just a few seconds, we'd know.
Oh yes!
Separate! Separate!
Separate! - 12 1000
Technicians: Break! Separate!
Oh no!
that's why... - How were you gonna use it again?
and uh...
that's enough, really.
next week these 2 completely lose touch with reality and try to get to the centre of the earth with a lawn mower.
I think we did quite well.
by what measure do you arrive at that conclusion?
well, in fair let's say there was only 1 bolt that let us down.
there's only 1 iceberg that sank the Titanic, it's still sank.
the fact of the matter is you just blew a big hole in Northumberland.
Yeah, and next week where all of us ruining Banffshire with tractors.
that's true but don't worry because I'm also driving up and down our track very fast in a Lamborghini
uh so we really hope we'll see you then, take care. Goodnight!
Torchwood.
outside the government, beyond the police.
fighting for the future on behalf of the human race.
the 21st century is when everything changes, and Torchwood is ready.
ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys, have we got a show for you tonight!
a once in a lifetime show.
amaze your ears,astonish your eyes, then run along home and tell your friends and neighbours.
a once in a lifetime show, never to be forgotten for the rest of your lives.
so, why not step inside?
we're waiting for you.
great!
what is that?
I know where you came from, mate, I know where you're going.
tosh?
I heard this sound.
an old sound, like a pipe organ.
a what?
did you hear anything? - No.
is there a circus in town, or a travelling fair, something like that?
on a night like this?
they'd be wasting their time.
Where's Lanto? He'd know.
he's gone to the cinema with Gwen and Owen, some kind of opening night he wanted to check out.
the building's got a record of rift activity but it's been quiet for years, so...
a nice trip to the cinema, you said. - Yeah, that's right.
Lanto, nothing down here, mate.
Oh, come on, Owen.
it's more than just a cinema.
it's the Electro!
Where's that stupid bloody son of ours?
he said he'd be here on time.
he'd better be. He's got the film.
and what good is a cinema without a film?
good evening, gentlemen.
evening, madam.
welcome to the Electro.
I love this place.
used to come here with my dad.
they'd show kids' films on Saturday morning.
so where's the popcorn and the ice cream?
I think you've missed out.
it's educational. - OK.
come on.
what time do you call this? - Sorry.
people are waiting.
you won't believe this, but when I was splicing the film.
just get up to that projection room. Now!
as proud owners of the Electro museum, it is our privilege to be able to show you how the cinema and Hope Street looked in days gone by.
if you watch carefully, who knows?
you may even see long-dead members of your family waiting in the cinema queue.
Bernard!
do you recognise any of your long-lost relatives, Gwen?
there's Aunty Peggy. She's been on the gin.
can you be quiet?
he's showing the wrong bloody film!
Where's Hope Street gone?
Oh, shit!
where the hell did that film come from? - I've no idea.
I swear I didn't edit those clips.
don't be stupid. - It's true.
just bloody well change it.
I can't. The machine won't switch off.
Oh, get out of the way. - This is crazy!
it's the same pictures over and over again.
Yeah.
come on, let's go.
wait!
I just saw Jack. - Where?
in the film.
what are you talking about? - What?
I swear I saw him.
Ianto. - Wait. Just wait.
come on. Let's go.
Yes, come on. Are you coming?
when the film stopped, these shadows went past me.
what kind of shadows?
I don't know. It wasn't clear.
there was something else.
you were up there on the screen.
as large as life.
what was I doing?
you were on some sort of stage.
outside a big tent.
you seemed to be part of a travelling show.
I heard it.
heard its music.
just a snatch of it.
that film was beautiful.
all those acts performing for us.
part of history, trapped on film forever.
their days were numbered.
cinema may have saved their images, but it finished off the travelling shows.
killed them.
I'm at the bus stop, Mum.
by Hope Street.
no. Gemma's brother couldn't bring me home.
his car don't work.
well, what about Dad?
can't you wake him? Mum?
would you like a ticket for the travelling show, my dear?
no, thanks.
every young person's dream.
perhaps she'd like to join the show instead.
why not?
you could travel with us.
forever.
look, just go away, will you?
did you hear what I said?
so you say the projector went haywire?
Yeah, even with the mains switched off it still kept running.
playing those film clips.
it's like it had a mind of its own.
working now. - I know.
where did you get these?
the basement. There were stacks of cans.
I've been compiling old footage of Hope Street and the Electro for the opening night.
but the circus clips weren't on it. I swear.
the film that was shown wasn't meant to be here?
no, and that's what's so scary.
I mean, it kind of played itself.
it's like it wanted to be seen.
like something tried to get through?
Yeah.
and there was a sound, like old fashioned music.
played on an organ or something.
and there was a face looking out at me.
and there was a smell, like... like bromine. Or iodine.
like film itself.
that's right.
and this is the film? - Yeah.
Jack, the systems here are behaving very oddly.
and I heard the sound you mentioned.
that fairground sound.
can you trace the source?
no. But there was a peak in rift activity at the Electro.
then nothing.
plus I'm recording unusual rift traces nearby.
where?
chain Lane.
runs parallel to Hope Street.
sending the co-ordinates now.
Tosh, we're on our way. Tell the police we're dealing with it.
epileptic maybe?
could be wearing a tag.
she isn't.
she got ID?
I'll check.
what's wrong?
she's got a heartbeat but she isn't breathing.
shouldn't really be alive.
and look at her mouth.
she's got no saliva.
look, her lips are cracked.
dry as a bone.
we need to get her to hospital.
sorry. We're closed.
do you hear me? We're closed.
make her cry.
you what?
I want to drink her tears.
the name's Nettie Williams.
her parents are outside.
she was visiting a friend.
have any witnesses come forward? - No.
has anyone been able to communicate with her?
no. No change in her condition.
motor response?
non-existent, they're treating it as a coma.
and they're wrong?
totally.
there's no signs of cerebral dysfunctions, no symptoms of hypoxia.
and her body's dehydrated.
you know when a spider sucks the liquid out of its victims?
well, this is a bit like that, except they've left her partly alive.
she couldn't cry about it even if she wanted to, the poor kid.
she's got no tears.
there's been another one.
who's she?
we don't know.
the paramedics found her.
it freaked them.
she was lying in an open doorway.
looking like this.
where was this?
the corner of Hope Street.
the same.
heartbeat but no breath.
her mouth's been drained of moisture.
this makes no sense, they're almost dehydrated and possibly brain dead yet somehow they're still with us.
some part of them has been taken elsewhere?
that's impossible.
for the body to be alive there must be a life force somewhere.
yet they've separated it, stolen it.
who has the power to do that?
I don't know. But we need to find out fast.
two people chosen at random.
who's next?
whatever's doing it has the whole city to choose from.
or the world.
I knew those two.
they argued day and night.
that is you.
all right, now I've seen everything!
I told you so.
you did stand-up?
I never did stand-up.
OK, then. A song and dance.
I was sensational!
I don't believe this, Jack.
what were you doing there?
he was part of the freak show.
some things never change.
are you being rude about me?
look at the state of them.
I do love his leotard.
the night travellers.
the what?
Tosh, play that back.
so, they did exist.
did you work with these people?
I didn't work with them, I never knew anyone who did.
they only performed in the dead of night.
anyway, it was just a tale that was around at that time.
a ghost story.
they came from out of the rain.
that's how people described them.
Jack, what did these night travellers do?
left a trail of damage and sorrow wherever they performed.
Tosh, can you run this frame by frame?
er, sure.
what are you looking for?
I'm not sure.
but something's wrong.
something's missing.
this must be back, now, yeah?
80 odd years.
then the travelling shows faded away.
no-one came to watch them and without an audience they died out. Forgotten.
until all we have to remember them by were these film clips.
Jack!
this film. It's not the same one we saw at the cinema.
course it's the same one.
no, things are different. Tosh.
easy to miss at first, but after watching it a few times I realised.
just there.
there was a woman in front of that water tank.
yeah there was, Lanto, you're right.
that's right, I remember her.
wearing almost nothing.
and there was a man in like a top hat, a sort of MC.
Yeah. That's right.
he was reaching down to the audience.
are you sure you brought the right can of film back?
positive.
so what are we saying?
Yeah.
like you said, trapped in film forever.
when they opened the cinema, it gave them a chance.
when that kid ran the film, he let them loose.
so they've become physical? They've escaped the film?
we need to find out more about the havoc they caused in the past.
we need evidence.
possible witnesses.
after all that time it'll be tricky.
what, town and parish records?
sure, we can do that.
how far back do you want us to go?
as far as you can.
we don't sleep till we find them.
toshiko, keep checking for sightings.
there's got to be a way of tracing them.
Lanto, with me, I need your local knowledge.
Oh, is that what you're calling it these days?
so, two people who should have been dead for years.
what kind of creatures are they?
no-one ever knew the night travellers were coming.
they'd just appear from nowhere.
not like the team I was with.
we'd send out flyers, bang drums, blow whistles.
ours was a small company.
walking the UK.
trying to find paying customers.
I was sent to investigate rumours of the night travellers.
by who?
long story.
so I joined a travelling show.
I was billed as the man who couldn't die.
the night travellers always found an audience.
they knew where to look.
step along now, ladies and gentlemen, come and see the show of a lifetime!
fill your eyes with the spectacle of the tattooed man!
witness for yourself the superhuman strength of the Mighty Stromboli!
he can take on Samson, Goliath and Hercules with one arm tied behind his back, and still have strength to dig their graves.
come along now, ladies and gentlemen, the night won't wait forever.
come and see the amazing Pearl!
she lives in water.
she sleeps among the waves.
she can reach the bottom of the oceans.
she has swum the seven seas.
she is the nearest thing that you will ever see to a living mermaid.
she will take your breath away.
how many other old cinemas are there in Cardiff?
most of them have been pulled down.
and the ones that are left?
converted.
this one is a pub.
Four-pint jugs for a fiver and girls in free before 11.
I'm registering the sea!
the sea?
inland?
running through the centre of town?
what is it?
I thought.
I thought I saw something.
saw what?
ghosts.
don't be stupid.
so the Electro is the only one left.
could the night travellers have performed there?
possibly.
if cinema killed the travelling show, maybe this is their way of fighting back.
their only chance to escape before every old movie theatre and piece of film has gone.
what better way to get revenge?
they were left forgotten, on pieces of film.
and now they're looking for a new audience.
what is it, Tosh?
she was picking up the sea.
in the middle of town.
it's gone now.
I was getting the sound of waves.
seagulls.
I could almost smell the ozone.
no other sightings? - No.
what the hell are they up to?
I like the lights.
they make the rain glisten.
and they're part of us.
smell the water.
taste it.
careful.
how many now?
six.
I wish I could see the air they once breathed.
you know you can never see it.
we could never see it.
we have their ghosts here.
I can see them whenever I want.
our audience.
they'll never leave us.
we can't see.
but we can hear. Listen.
I can!
I can hear them.
little last breaths, still sighing their sighs.
can we bring the others?
make ghosts forever?
the others shouldn't be in some old dark cupboard.
they should be here with us.
and I want to travel again, perform.
all right.
but first we need the rest of that film.
found in a car with their parents, near Hope Street.
Oh, no.
what happened to the parents?
they're in the same cataleptic state.
they came from out of the rain.
what did you say?
nothing.
Why?
those words,'From out of the rain'.
I'm sure I've heard them before.
Oh, I remember, it was Christina. She was a patient.
here?
no, at Providence Park, it's a psychiatric hospital.
I know it.
I used to work there.
she was a full-time patient, been there since she was a child.
she was a strange one.
whenever anything, any kind of entertainment show was laid on, she became scared.
she'd run away and hide.
did she say why?
Yes. She said they were coming to steal her last breath.
poor love.
I think we've just found ourselves our first witness.
they came from out of the rain. At night.
came to the village.
how old were you at the time?
Oh, just a child.
five, I think, or six.
are you visiting someone?
Christina, we've come to see you.
no one comes to see me.
your eyes are older than your face.
is that a bad thing?
Yes.
it means you don't belong.
it means you're from nowhere.
Christina, tell us about them, the people who came out of the rain.
there was music, hurdy-gurdy music, acrobats and a man with fire in his hands.
who else was there?
a man in dark clothes, and a woman.
a beautiful young woman in a silvery costume.
she seemed to glisten.
they touched you, I can sense it.
they touched you as they passed you by.
tell us about the man, Christina.
he spoke to me.
he asked if I would like to join the travelling show.
he took a kind of flask out of his pocket.
it was polished like silver.
I asked him his name.
Oh, I shall never forget it.
I never shall.
he said he was the ghost maker.
he wanted to take my breath and put it in his flask.
he said I could travel with his circus.
I would be in his audience forever.
I turned and ran away as fast as I could.
people went missing from the village that night.
my mother, my father.
here we go.
church Stretton, 1901.
people went missing when a travelling show visited the town, and there was one earlier on.
1898, a small village called Wellsfield.
these disappearances, there's a lot of old wives' tales attached to them through the years.
people still alive but been deprived of breath, children being told to hold their breath while the travelling show passes by.
Yeah, this local paper didn't take it seriously.
Hunstanton Chronicle, March 1911.
police and doctors were left amused and baffled when Mr Alfred Mace insisted that his dead wife could be brought back to life providing a certain flask could be found.
he reckoned his wife's last breath had been put in a flask，a silver flask，and the last breath of each victim.
so that's how he makes his ghosts.
so if we find the flask.
we can save them.
now we have the film.
time to bring the others.
Jack, this is Jonathan, they're here, they're at my flat, you've got to get over here now!
who was in there?
a woman, lying under water.
I thought she'd drowned. - Anyone else?
no.
be careful.
did Bernard say he was coming here today?
no.
David.
this way, please.
so they haven't left the area.
they probably can't.
probably need to be near the Electro.
all my old film cans have been opened.
what was on them?
clips from circus sideshows.
they're bringing more through.
then we need to stop them.
Gwen, Owen, meet us at the Electro.
look, what's going on?
I've got to find my Mum and Dad.
if anything's happened to them.
Hey, there's that smell again.
like chemicals.
Yeah, I can smell it.
like when you develop a film.
that woman.
she grabbed me.
but her hand, it was different.
it wasn't like a hand. It wasn't like flesh.
it was... it was like touching a piece of plastic, a piece of celluloid.
they were on this film for 80 years.
became part of it.
what if we filmed them?
a film of a film? - Yeah.
then they'd be trapped.
is this thing loaded?
if they were trapped on film before, they can be got rid of in the same way.
let's suppose they're made of camphor and nitrate, made of shadows, made of light. Just enough light.
we film them.
capture them in that.
then expose the film to as much light as possible.
of course. We'd blank them out, we'd lose them.
let's hope so.
Jack? - Yeah?
we're at the Electro. Something's happening inside.
let's go.
do you hear that?
maybe it's my mum and dad.
would they lock themselves in? - No.
please let them be OK. Please.
mum? Dad? - Take it easy.
what's going on?
mum?
no, Jonathan. - Mum! Dad!
what's happened? Please!
don't die, please!
speak to me!
No! Leave me alone!
they've been frozen in place, a circus needs an audience.
get him out of here.
jonathan, come on. - Leave me alone.
Owen, find out who's upstairs.
the same pictures as before.
Jack.
they're coming through.
open up!
we've done it.
we're together again.
this place is ours.
it belongs to us.
this whole city belongs to us!
what are you?
there's not a breath in your poor, sad body.
you're no use to me.
the flask! He's got it!
I've got it!
Gwen, are you all right?
are you OK? - Yes!
Owen, look after the family.
No! Please!
if their breaths escaped the flask all the victims will die.
quick! We could lose them forever!
they're flat-lining, call the crash team.
one.
I think we saved just one.
I hear it, Jack.
I heard it, something inside calling out to me.
so we managed to save one.
but which one?
there was nothing we could do.
they all died so suddenly, except this poor little soul.
I suppose he'll be next to go.
what are you doing?
I need your help.
what is that thing?
please. Just trust me.
give me a hand.
careful.
hold his head.
what's in there?
something that belongs to him.
his last breath, his life.
what have you done to him?
it worked.
welcome back.
those reels of film in Jonathan's workroom.
I took them out, destroyed them.
let's hope that's an end to it.
what worries me are all those long lost pieces of film, tucked away in dusty cellars, hidden in lofts.
the night travellers could still be there, somewhere.
just waiting.
how much is this?
Jonah Bevan disappeared walking home from football practice.
why is this one so special?
something's glowing, just out of the camera's line of sight.
cardiff has an epidemic of missing persons.
Oh, my God.
I'll make it my own special project.
no, leave it alone. - I can't.
he's got to be out there somewhere.
can we keep this to ourselves?
you're covering it up, in the Bristol Channel?
what if the rift doesn't just leave stuff behind?
what if it also takes?
what's your mate doing there?
any reason you'd be on the barrage that night?
close this down!
we are coming. Every child in the world is speaking English.
we are coming. And one man.
you're pregnant.
have you told Rhys?- I've only just found out myself.
he is going to love that.
we are coming.
this morning it woke up. Transmitting on the 456.
it's a transmission, a pulse, a broadcast.
we are coming. You never tell me anything these days.
dad died, that was it. He is very handsome.
you're kidding me? Really though?
we are coming. It might be best if certain historical events were taken off the record.
you never told me. I was never a part of it.
there's a bomb in your stomach. Stop it! Stop it! We are coming.
John! There'll be nothing left of you. I can survive anything.
back!
Whoa! Whoa! You can't go back there, love.
no, no, no, it's too dangerous. My friend's still in there.
go back to the ambulance. Walk as quick as you can, now.
let me go and get him. Let me go!
let me go! No!
hold her down! Control said no survivors.
Aaagh!
sorry, I've got to take this.
work? After what just happened?
because of it. They're OK now.
get yourselves to bed, girls.
and don't worry.
hello. Target one's eliminated.
two and three have escaped, but we're in pursuit. What went wrong?
they got lucky. But they won't get far. We can't have witnesses.
call me when you've got them.
and make it quick!
off to bed.
I've got the translations.
instructions.
specifications for something they want us to build.
and we haven't got much time to do it in.
when they can communicate like this, in this kind of detail, why do the thing with the children?
because they can.
and because they want to scare us.
who do you work for?
who do you work for?
the NHS.
who do you work for?!
you tried to kill me. My friends could be dead. So don't think I won't use this.
I'm working for the government. I just follow orders, that's all. We're on the same side?
Aaaargh!
why would the government want to destroy Torchwood? Why?
I just do as I'm told. I'm just following orders, that's all.
radio: "Please come in."
Jackson, keep the police back.
you, come with me.
if she's anti-terrorist, I would not mind being Uncle Terrorist.
get some back up. Two escaped suspects.
Ianto Jones, Gwen Cooper. Armed and dangerous.
I know Gwen Cooper. She's an ex-police officer, she's not a terrorist.
haven't you got tape to tie?
I want their homes raided.
Gwen Cooper is not a terrorist.
you must know where she lives.
get up! Now! We've got to go! -Bloody hell, Gwen!
and if they're after me, they're going to come after you. Now get up, and get dressed! -What?
come on Rhys, faster, faster!
all right, all right.
down to the bottom, take a left.
I mean, shouldn't there be some sort of briefing first?
like a risk assessment?
not that Gwen's a risk.
Rhys, car keys? Try the top of the fridge, I think.
I've tried on the top of the bloody fridge, man! Come on!
if you put the keys in the same place all the time we wouldn't have to go through this time and time again!
what are you doing?- Packing.
you're not going to have time to read! And they can trace us with that!
well, I've not gone into hiding before!
so, er, you lot are some sort of specialists from London. Am I right?
I mean, I totally respect that. Really I do.
but sometimes, there's no substitute for a little bit of local knowledge.
and let me tell you, Gwen'll be absolutely no bother.
we're not going in there all guns blazing, are we?
how far is it?
two minutes.
come on, come on...Come on.
No! Rhys! Rhys!
hello. -Jesus Christ, Rhys! - It's Ianto, right?
Christ's sake, man!
Ianto, are you OK?
Yeah, have you heard from Jack?
no. No I haven't. Sorry, hang on.
do you think he survived? He usually does.
who was it?I had a run-in with one of them. Said he was working for the government.
that doesn't make sense. How did they get close enough to plant it inside him, Ianto?
it was him, that Dr Rupesh. He was shot and killed in the hospital earlier.
it must've been then.
let's go. Take the bag. Get the car ready.
er, where shall we meet, Ianto?
your phone, your phone could be bugged.
erm, right... Er...
remember the last time we had ice cream together?
no. - Yeah, you do. After the Grand Slam.
I don't like ice cream. It gives me a headache.
I've got to go.
go!
now do you believe she's a terrorist?
she shot the wheels.
what kind of terrorist shoots your wheels?
a clever one.
right. I think...we made it.
let's go. - Where?
can't we just take a minute? Just to...
number plate recognition. They can trace us. We need to ditch it. - It's a brand new car!
it's no good to us now, OK? We need to keep moving.
wouldn't it be better if we gave ourselves up?
when I know what's happened, I'll tell someone. Until then, we're going underground.
let me carry the bag.
you want your trigger finger free, don't you?
we're looking for Ianto Jones.
don't move! Don't move!
we're looking for Ianto Jones. - Well, you won't find him in my bed, will you?! I'm a married man.
what? - Keep your phones on today.
Why? - I want to be able to speak to you.
since when? - Since we were possessed by the Devil. - I'm serious.
if they go off during a lesson, we can't get them back till Friday.
keep them on mute.
every suspicious phone call, every time you come home late, you hide behind the Official Secrets Act.
and I put up with it. - Don't start on this. Not now.
I saw how scared you were last night.
I know.
it's frightening to see it first hand, there's no lasting damage.
it's quickly over. - This isn't a hula hoop craze.
it happened to Brian and Wendy's kids in Canada. You don't think this is over any more than I do.
just make sure they keep their phones on. And don't let them come home on their own.
I'm off now, girls.
I'll see you. - Goodbye kisses, it must be serious.
if you could get out of bed at a proper time, you'd get plenty of kisses.
have a good day.
dad? - What?
we want a pony.
we want a pony.
we want a pony. - See?
nothing to worry about.
TV:"Latest headlines.
further reports are coming in about the explosion in Cardiff last night.
no organisation has yet claimed responsibility for the explosion, which went off in the Bay area of the city..."
isn't that where Uncle Jack lives? - It's a big place. Shh!
casualty figures remain low, with two people reported missing.
TV: "Residents in Cardiff are reacting with shock and outrage.
the entire bay area has been closed off and witnesses say the effects of the explosion last night could be felt five miles away.
no-one can say for sure why this area was the site of such an unexpected attack, and the Prime Minister's office has refused to speculate until more details are known.
fortunately, the timing of the device...＂
as you know, Harkness is a difficult man to kill.
current theories suggest that his longevity is connected in some way to the Torchwood Hub, which necessitated taking out the entire operation.
he can't still be alive, after that.
as I said, awaiting results.
what about these, er... these specifications?
from the 456? I could barely understand a word of them.
nor me. But I'm told the translations are excellent.
and they've started work. Dekker's called in the damage control team, they're working as fast as they can.
early reports are looking, well, promising.
can we see it? They'll be ready to show us work in progress by 1600 hours.
we're building something and we don't even know what it is.
can I ask?
did the 456 contact any other country?
intel's been listening.
no chatter on the wires. Seems like it's only Britain.
and how long can we keep it secret?
given the children's last statement, "We are coming back."
that's what everyone seems to be asking when were they here before?
Yes.
well, if that's everything...Sir.
sir, I'd just, um...
I just wanted to say how grateful I am, sir. - What for?
well.
I know that I'm something of a middleman in these affairs, but um...
I just wanted to thank you, for trusting me with the responsibility.
all I've done is put you on the front line.
that's what the front line's for, John.
first to fall.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
come on, check the gas is turned off.
get some breathing equipment down here.
hang on! Stop! I've got something!
Hello? If you can hear me, clench your hand.
it's not a body. It's just the arm.
answer PHONE: "This is Jack Harkness. Leave a message and I'll get back to you.
it's me. Call me when you get a chance.
mum, there's no toothpaste.
everything OK? - Yeah. They're expecting us, the car's waiting.
well, come on then.
Hello?
we thought there was a body, but we've got an arm, a shoulder and the remains of a head. It's almost a waste of a body bag.
is it Harkness? - Presumably.
take him to Ashton Down. Keep him under surveillance.
sorry, sir, I couldn't help hearing that name, Harkness.
is that Captain Jack Harkness?
from Torchwood? Only he was trying to contact you yesterday.
I did mark it in the log, said he could help.
not now, he can't. Are you sure? He was very insistent.
he told me his team were the experts at dealing with things like the children thing.
he told you that? Over the phone? - Yes.
he always was an arrogant sod.
so, he can't help?
he's not really the expert?
that bomb in Cardiff last night. He was the one at the centre of it. It tore him to shreds.
does that mean whoever's behind the bomb's behind the children thing? Like they wanted him out of the way?
Lois, your job.
you don't overhear phone calls. You speak when you're spoken to. OK?
sorry.
Thanks, mate.
it'll be from Uncle Ianto.
SSH! We're probably bugged.
innocent kids, fast asleep at home, and a gang of uniformed thugs break in and point guns at their head?
it's no wonder they're traumatised. It's no wonder our poor David pissed the bed.
I didn't. - Ha, you big baby!
it's the police state to blame, and I'm going to rinse the bastards for every penny they've got!
Oh, shut up, Johnny!
what's he done?
Why's he bringing it to our door?
Hey, hey.
we're the only family he's got.
put it in here.
come on, come on!
no. They've frozen mine, as well! Shit!
what now? How're we going to manage without money, Gwen?
we need to get to London. - London?
everything's dearer in London! - That's where all the decisions are made.
whoever wants us dead, that's where they'll be. - Right. So where we should be is John O'Groats!
I need to speak to people, but I haven't got anybody's numbers any more.
so we've got to go there, OK? These things are all linked.
soon as you put your card in, bells start ringing somewhere. Come on.
any change? - No.
complete waste of time.
the body next door, Rupesh Patanjali.
london wants to know if it's OK to release him to the family.
zip it open.
it was a bag of bits when it came in.
and I asked you to keep an eye on it.
get it out of that thing and cuff it to the wall.
hello. The good news is, we don't have to wait for the DNA tests.
this is definitely Jack Harkness.
Jesus Christ!
if he can survive that, what can't he survive?
I haven't got time to worry about this, Johnson.
I've got more important things in my in-tray.
what about Cooper and Jones? - No sign of him yet.
we've had a sighting of her at a Cardiff ATM.
we need that whole team out of the way by tonight. Get it done.
wait out here.
now me, I use an electronic seal, see.
even the driver doesn't know the code. No-one gets in until it reaches it's destination.
but this clown... Sure he's going to London?
I don't question how you defend the world against extra terrestrial infiltration.
don't you question my knowledge of the haulage industry? - Sorry.
it's a small company, Gwen.
cardiff to London. Piss poor security.
and best of all, guaranteed food cargo.
I'm absolutely bloody starving.
the smell from Tony's is driving me crackers.
there is food. I can't fault you on that.
I've got the smell of bacon in my nostrils, and I'm looking at a lorry-load of raw spuds.
there might be other things at the back.
come on.
have you got your pen knife?
Rhys, you are not eating uncooked potatoes!
we'll need it to cut our way out.
what kind of snoops are you? Dibble or dole?
dunno what you're talking about. So you're perverts, then?
is it you making them do all the weird talking shit? Everyone look, a couple of paedos on the estate!
we have observations in place.
he'd have been better off staying dead.
how are you, love?
my best friend's belly had a bomb go off in it last night.
someone's been trying to kill us.
I'm travelling at 70mph on top of potatoes, and I think I'm going to be sick.
travel sick, is it?
when have you ever known me to be travel sick?
well, when have you ever travelled like this?
on an empty stomach.
what?
you know some announcements, you rehearse in your head?
Yeah. And this wasn't quite what I had in mind.
what do you mean, announcements?
Oh, God, no!
Yes. - Bloody hell, no! - Yes.
Oh, come here. Oh, my God!
I don't believe it.
hang on...
the bomb, the guns, the car-chase, the hiding from the law.
what am I like? Letting you do all that in your condition! You carried my bag.
I'm serious. This changes everything.
no, it doesn't. We're up the same creek, and we still need a paddle.
Yeah, but three of us in the boat.
Hey.
Oh, my God! What happened to you?
I'm not sure yet.
I wasn't followed. Sit down.
you worked out my little code, then?
dad didn't break your leg on purpose, you know.
he pushed me too hard. He always did.
well, you should've held on tighter.
seriously. How did you get in that state?
that bomb. It was meant for me and the people I work with.
my God! Why? - I don't know.
what sort of civil servants are you?
unappreciated ones.
are they OK?
the people you work with? - I don't know. Gwen's alive, but I've just no way of contacting her. I'm not sure about Jack.
is he your boss?
the one Susan saw you with?
he'll be OK.
they won't get rid of him that easy.
I just need to find him, if it's a boy.
Edward.
Edward? - Yeah.
after the king.
come on! Out of the way! Come on!
we are coming tomorrow.
we are coming tomorrow.
we are coming tomorrow.
OK, I'll tell him.
it's happened again.
shit.
what did they say? - "We are coming tomorrow."
we are coming tomorrow. We are coming tomorrow. We are coming tomorrow...
we are coming tomorrow.
we are...This has something to do with it. It must do.
can you smell that?
they're coming!
I can smell them. They're coming!
tomorrow, and they'll be here.
Hey, hey, hello. What did it feel like?
leave her alone! Go away! - They said the same thing here.
leave her alone. Piss off, you perv!
Yeah, OK, bye. It happened to David and Mica. What is it? What is it?
I need to find Jack. Give me that.
how will this help? I took the number of the van they put him in.
you can track any vehicle with the right computer programmes. Really? - Yeah. Give me the car keys.
Oh, Johnny'll do his nut!
please! We don't have time to spare.
a "thank you" would be nice!
look, I'm sorry. I've got to go. Thanks for all this.
be careful!
hold the line, please. Hello, I'll put you on hold if that's all right.
mr Frobisher will be back in a moment.
I'll have to put you on hold... Hello?
sorry, it's chaotic here at the moment with the children thing...
reports confirm that every single child said the same thing.
give me the name and I'll look into it, and get back to you.
get my daughters on the phone. Ring the school office if you have to.
then get me the Prime Minister.
there's a call waiting, sir.
take a message! It's the Home Secretary.
and your wife wants you to call her. - OK.
hello. John Frobisher's office.
can I speak to Mr Frobisher, please?
he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?
it's Gwen Cooper from Torchwood.
I need to see him urgently. Can you set up a meeting?
erm... I'm not sure. - Just put me straight through, then.
he's very busy.
Yeah, he would be! Who is this? - Lois. Lois Habiba.
what happened to Bridget Spears?
she's on another line. - "Do you know what Torchwood is, Lois?
Yes. - Then you should know that right now you lot need us. The whole world needs us.
why would the government want to kill people who can help? - That's why I need to see him!
look, I know all this sounds mad, but you have to believe me. I do. I do believe you.
hold the line, please. Call my wife. I'm in a meeting with the PM.
I'll ring as soon as I can. I'm putting the school through. Ah!
if you're tracing this call...
I'm not.
so you can set up a meeting, then?
Lilly, is Holly there? They're both all right?
are you sure? - Yes.
the Prime Minister's on his way. He'll be there in ten minutes.
OK, thanks. Ring ahead, let them know we're coming. - Right.
Simon, we're going back to Thames House.
can we trust this guy?
we've got to trust someone, Rhys, OK?
Hi. I'm Lois.
Where's Frobisher?
he's not coming. - Why not?
Oh, God, this is probably the worst mistake of my life.
I've read your files. Some of the stuff you've done, you're like unsung national heroes.
listen, I don't do autographs and I don't want to be rude, but why am I talking to you and not your boss?
because if he knew you were here you'd be dead.
he gave the order to have Jack Harkness killed.
are you sure?
I've seen it with my own eyes.
we really are in trouble.
do you know a Captain Andrew Staines? - No.
a Colonel Michael Sanders?
Ellen Hunt? - No.
they're all dead.
they were killed on the same day as Jack Harkness.
I didn't sign the Official Secrets Act to cover up murder.
but then, I didn't take the job to commit treason on my second day.
what am I doing here? - You tell me, Lois.
if you're the bad guys, why doesn't it say that on your file?
and if you're the good guys, who am I working for, and why do they want you dead?
listen, this a lot to talk about.
and we're going to arouse suspicion.
and we haven't ordered.
when we went on the run, we didn't have any money, see?
we put the last of the coins into the phone box to get through to you.
so If there's any chance you could, er...
thank you. Oh, great. Thanks. That's magic.
I'll have steak pie and chips.
and a cup of tea. Just a latte for me.
OK, I won't be a sec. I'll leave you to it.
Thanks, we owe you one. A big one.
everyone in the office seems to think what's happening with the kids is all to do with aliens.
and that they'll be here tomorrow.
and there's something big being built on the top floor of the MI5 building.
OK, what do you mean something? - I don't know.
but it's like they're getting ready.
and if you lot... Torchwood...
if you're the alien experts, and they really are coming tomorrow, why does Mr Frobisher want you out of the way all of a sudden?
I've no idea. But I'm going to find out.
jones is missing.
I've been told Captain Harkness is dead. - Well, that can't be true.
well, that's what I thought.
I overheard Mr Frobisher say to keep him under surveillance. Why do that to a dead person?
come on! Who's the genius behind the camera?
come on, come on out and take your bow!
show yourself! Face me like a man!
I'm not a man.
who are you?
what's all this about?
apparently you can't die, so it would be foolish to tell you anything.
but I will say this. If I can't kill you, I can contain you.
Gwen: Do you know where they're keeping him?
I've got a floor plan in my bag.
steak pie and chips, twice? - Oh, lovely, thank you.
it's, um...
it's a military compound.
are you sure?
that's where Mr Frobisher told them to take him. - Salt? - Thanks. This is brilliant work, Lois.
this is Rupesh Patanjali.
they must have thought he was one of us.
the undertaker's name is Richard Rossiter and he's got an appointment to pick him up at 5. 30 today.
I was thinking, access to a funeral director would be easier than access to a secure military compound. So...
he'd have to pass through here at some time between 5 and 5. 15 to get to Ashton Down for 5. 30, and there'd be no witnesses.
the name of the contact at the compound is a Corporal Camara.
his number's on there, and he'll be expecting you. Sugar?
I'm a PA. It's what I do.
when this is all over, and you want a job, come and see me.
I'm sorry.
I don't suppose you'll believe it.
but this is all in the national interest.
prime Minister. Ready?
let's go.
have they sent us any further information?
not since they sent us the designs for this thing.
we're sending out continuous messages on the 456 wavelength, but we're getting nothing back. Don't mind me.
what's that for?
it's for them.
Hi, we're here to pick up a body.
5. 30 appointment. Corporal Camara?
kodak's dead!? When did that happen?
no, he's the contact.
the name of the deceased is Patanjali. Rupesh Patanjali.
Jesus!
he owes me money. Sorry. I'll have to look in the back.
Kodak, got a couple of body-snatchers down at the gate for you, over.
OK, let 'em in. Over.
we're not going to get away with this.
you really shouldn't be here, Rhys. - I shouldn't?! Hello?!
if Jack needs carrying, you're going to need me here.
see that fire exit? Do you wanna back up to that?
save you having to wheel him round the block. OK.
so there's an upside to this place being turned into a mortuary all of a sudden.
so you don't get many bodies, then?
not usually.
but we've got in three at the moment.
do I know you? - No, I don't think so.
you don't look like an undertaker.
if more undertaker's looked like you, there'd be more of a demand for bereavement.
Ooh, ooh, hang on. I'm just going to open the fire door for your mate.
corporal Camara at the west corridor. I'm just opening the fire door for the body-snatchers. OK?
OK.
she's shy, isn't she?
I just prefer the company of dead people.
is she seeing anyone? - She's married. Married and pregnant, so you can forget it, mate, right?
you're a couple, aren't you?
no offence. You can't blame a man for trying.
do you want to check this is the right one? Yeah.
corporal Camara?
Yeah.
everything OK? The camera's not working.
Yeah. Just checking the paperwork. No problem.
what's going? I've lost two cameras now.
that's the one. Come on.
intruders, two of, west corridor.
intruders, two of, west corridor.
shit. Leave it, Rhys. Out the way!
what the hell is that?
move! Move! Move! Positions.
we'll have to surrender.
I'd lay down your weapons, if I were you.
you're as trapped and helpless as the man in the concrete cell.
put the guns down!
OK.
run! Positions. Come on! Positions. Come on, get on.
Ah, Ianto. You took your time. Come on.
come on!
move it! Take your positions.
they're going to catch up. Rhys, get out and move that truck.
hold on tight.
move, Rhys!
come on.
we've got a problem.
Cooper and Jones stalled us at a roadblock.
how did that happen? I'm sorry. There's a chopper on the way, but they've got a head start on us.
if he talks, we're in deep, deep shit. I'll have to call you back.
where the hell are you taking us, Ianto?
what are we doing?
you'll see. Get the car started! We've only got a few minutes. Come on!
told you I'd be back with a little help from us.
what the hell is going on? Dunno yet, but the latest from the kids is that it's happening tomorrow.
I'm just in time, then. Get in the car.
come on, we've got work to do.
TV:" United Nations has issued a statement asking parents and guardians of children...
TV: "still remains why every child in the world is giving their statements in English...
TV:."no theories as to why and how...
TV:"The focus now is on tomorrow.
with every child in the world claiming that tomorrow is the day, the world is left wondering.
mr Frobisher, sir.
seals locked and release as per the 456 instructions.
a combination of 25% nitrosyl chloride, 22% hydrogen chloride, 20% nitrogen, 12% fluorine, 9% hydrogen cyanide, 6% acetone, 6% phosgene.
in short, poison.
I'd hold on to your nose, Bridget!
though, come to think of it, you've been doing that for years. And that's what they breathe?
breathe? Eat? Fart?
we know nothing about them! Excuse me, if we know the composition of that gas, can't we work out what sort of creature could live inside it?
could do. If we had all the time in the world!
so they arrive...
and then what?
the whole room's laid out, according to 456 instructions.
something of an ambassadorial suite, I'd say.
or a throne room.
who knows, maybe a slaughterhouse.
but if they arrive tomorrow, then how?
how do they arrive inside that?
no idea.
who else knows about this? For all we know, they've sent the same instructions to every country in the world.
we've said nothing, maybe everyone else is keeping quiet, too.
Oh, I don't think so. Whoever they are, they're coming for Britain.
well, why? - Exactly.
why is that, Mr Frobisher?
John Frobisher's a good man.
and better than that, he's expendable.
if anybody finds out what I'm doing... It's treason!
you're the only friend we've got left, Lois. We are coming. We are coming.
it's them, it's all of them - the kids. We are here.
all: We are coming.
we are coming.
we are coming.
we are coming.
the 456: We want ten percent of the children of this world.
Frobisher: And if we refuse?
the 456: We will wipe out your entire species.
I can survive anything, but you can't.
no, no, no, no, no, no. Not him!
the 456: And tomorrow, your people will deliver the children.
there's one thing I always meant to ask Jack back in the old days.
I wanted to know about that Doctor of his.
the man who appears out of nowhere and saves the world.
except sometimes he doesn't.
all those times in history when there was no sign of him, I wanted to know why not.
but I don't need to ask any more.
I know the answer now.
sometimes the Doctor must look at this planet and turn away in shame.
I'm recording this in case anyone ever finds it, so you can see...
you can see how the world ended.
prime Minister: Today, we're taking steps to safeguard your children.
the schools are being opened again.
and we urge all of you to send your children back to their classes straight away.
government representatives will be visiting certain schools to discuss a series of inoculations.
what's inoculations?
injections. - I don't want to go to school.
you're not going, either. You're staying put.
just like your Uncle Ianto said "Don't trust any of them."
but the man said we got to go.
and I know for a fact he's lying.
these inoculations are to protect your children.
these inoculations are safe.
these inoculations will guarantee no repeat of the problems of the past four days.
David, on your feet.
go to the Baxters opposite, then go to Sally's, then go to Mrs Singh.
tell 'em we'll have the kids, only free of charge.
it's 10 quid a kid! - Shut it, you! And run!
Rhiannon: Tell them my brother works for the government, he said it's not safe.
Yes, Mum!
so, I ask of you now, to cooperate, to send your children back to school, and to resume your lives as normal.
we'd better get ready for school, then.
no, darling. Your father said stay at home with me.
Why?
what's so different about us?
and as ever, I thank you for your patience, your understanding and your faith.
we've isolated 2, 600 primary schools, sir.
I'm sorry, but you'll address me in all matters concerning this operation.
this information is for Mr Green.
you and Mr Green and this government have proven yourselves incapable of handling this crisis.
all decisions will now go through me. You were saying?
we have 2, 600 primary schools listed here.
we're mobilizing transport.
at 12:00 hours, the British Army will take the children from their schools to the designated rendezvous points.
what if they refuse, the soldiers? We could have a mutiny on our hands.
they've been told any soldier refusing to do his duty will make his own family liable.
so we take them to the rendezvous points, but what then?
we're about to find out.
they're entering Thames House right now.
disinfectant doesn't work, you can still smell it.
there were bodies lying deep around those doors.
mr Dekker, I take it.
you managed to survive.
I just stood back, sir.
a strategy that's worked all my life.
now then, best not keep it waiting.
I seek audience with the 456.
my name is Colonel Augustus Oduya of the Unified Intelligence Taskforce.
if I might speak, we have no choice but to initiate your plan. May God help me.
but I need to ask.
we have designated rendezvous points, selected army bases in all participating countries, but once the children are assembled, what then?
Oduya: How do you collect them?
as we arrived. Observe.
some sort of transportation device taking them God knows where.
then let me ask, not as a representative, as a father.
you need these children.
we've seen you hooked up to that boy, but why?
are they keeping you alive?
no.
then what are they for?
the hit.
I don't understand.
the hit.
they create chemicals.
the chemicals are good.
good in what way?
we feel good.
the chemicals are good.
they're like drugs?
they're trading in drugs?
you're shooting up on children?
our children?
let's not forget, your government started this trade.
you opened the market over 40 years ago.
are the troops on standby?
Yes, sir.
then we begin.
the government claims it's Britain back to normal.
schools across the country are being reopened and parents are being urged to return their children to a normal routine.
the inoculation programme will begin at midday, and the World Health Organisation has issued a statement guaranteeing the safety and beneficial effects of the treatments.
critics are still demanding more information but the government is simply asking for trust.
the threat still stands. - Haven't we gone past that?
my husband is still out there with everything you've done recorded on his laptop.
one word from me and he will release that information to the public.
what do you think Torchwood is now?
do you think you're still players?
we can try.
we're at a tipping point right now.
civilisation's about to fall into hell.
you wanna start that descent a little earlier? Go ahead.
he's right.
look what happened.
phone Rhys, tell him we've lost.
Hello?
Yeah, me, I'm bloody freezing.
where are you? You all right?
do you want me to send the files?
it's too late, sweetheart.
they've killed him.
not just Clem, they've... They've killed Ianto.
he's dead.
what about Lois?
I'm afraid Miss Habiba is in police custody. Charged with espionage.
then what about my daughter and her son?
they're free to go.
Ianto Jones, he's got family back in South Wales, a sister, has she been told?
we're not releasing any of the names, not yet.
then let Gwen tell her.
you said yourself the world is going to hell any second.
before it does, give us a moment of grace.
just take Gwen home, please.
I can't look at her any more.
cell M 3, Captain Harkness, 9:50 am.
Lois: Captain, is that you?
captain Harkness, it's me. It's Lois. It's Lois.
captain?
what are they doing? What's happening out there?
can you hear me?
what do we do?
captain?
you might want to take a look at this.
Steven, come on. - I want to see.
not now, darling, this is for grown ups.
Suzanne, get him a Coke or something.
woman: received and confirmed.
it's inside Thames House.
johnson: All recorded by Torchwood.
they're inventive, I'll give' em that.
that's a child, abducted in 1965.
now they want more, millions more.
and in two hours' time, the government is handing them over.
yes?
you asked to see me, sir?
take a seat.
a terrible day.
sir, I was wondering... - Your name was chosen, John.
right. Good.
in what way chosen?
the inoculation story seems to have gained some currency.
might even be called popular.
indeed. And what's that got to do with me?
your children will be inoculated.
I see.
in two hours, there will be selected news media at your house.
you'll be seen to offer your children for treatment.
this will be broadcast on every network channel at 12:00 midday.
but there is no inoculation.
this action will help the public and show them no cause for unrest.
you mean, I pretend they're going to be inoculated?
your children will then be taken to one of the designated rendezvous points and they'll become part of the... the process.
it's our duty now to think beyond this terrible day.
and once it's over, the government must be seen as victims of the 456.
we must be seen to have lost.
if you put me on camera, I will tell people the truth.
then your daughters would know where they're going.
best not.
I can't do it! I won't!
you can't make me!
in which case, your children will be taken without you.
but you've seen what they do to them!
they're just girls, sir!
they're just girls!
they're not... They're not... They're not...
I'm sorry, John.
I'm really... I'm really very sorry.
and I'm really very busy.
what did he want?
Bridget, I need a Requisition 31.
what for?
quick as you can. - But what for, sir?
requisition 31, thank you.
Bridget: Requisition 31 .
just sign there.
Andy: Everyone's on standby. It's red alert.
riot gear and everything.
all ready to mobilise, except no one's saying why. What's going on?
I can't tell you. - I am the police!
right now, Andy, I need you to drive this car.
and if I told you...
what? Well, come on, then. What?
don't you bloody hate people who don't finish their sentences?
Hey, she's pregnant.
Oh, thank you.
who's the father?
Oh, I'm slapping you, yeah?
GWEN: It's Torchwood.
that's what did it.
they give you retcon and chemicals and radiation and God knows what.
bloody Pill didn't stand a chance.
that's what Torchwood does, you see.
it ruins your life.
how is it ruined?
you wanna have kids in a world like this, Rhys?
you're not getting rid of it.
is that right?
take the next left.
Ianto's sister lives off the Cromwell Estate.
Denise: 11: 00. One hour to go.
are we in position?
troops are moving in, sir.
thank you.
I've come to tell you how we met.
who?
how I met John Frobisher.
it was 30 years ago.
you weren't even born.
I was on attachment to the civil service, only for six months.
and just down the corridor, there he was.
you wouldn't think it to look at him now, but he was a clumsy thing.
always losing his keys.
Mr. Swales never thought he'd amount to much, but I thought, " Well, keep an eye on that one."
and all the others came and went.
the high flyers, they burnt out or went on to something better.
and do you know what John Frobisher did?
he kept working.
head down, worked hard, all his life.
it was another 10 years before we actually worked in the same office.
he asked for me.
I didn't think he even knew my name.
and we made quite the team.
I'm not saying he was perfect.
you know that better than me.
but he worked hard. He always worked hard.
I don't think that's valued enough these days, hard work.
and he was a good man.
I want you to know that John Frobisher was a good man.
because when the history of this is written, they'll talk about the ministers, and the soldiers, and the things with numbers for names.
and I think people will forget how very good he was.
I want you to remember him like that.
if ever you think of John Frobisher, just remember that it wasn't his fault.
now, I think I should get back to work.
Gwen: Rhys, you stay here. Give us a shout if anything happens.
like what? - Just keep an eye out, yeah?
you know Ianto?
was he gay? - Shut up.
they might not know.
well, in which case, do not say. - Well, that proves my point.
look, listen, there's a lot more going on.
you've just got to trust me. Okay. She's got two kids.
we need to find out where they are.
that's why we need a car.
we might have to pick them up from school and take them back to mine, okay?
back to yours? What for?
Andy, we've got to look after these kids. Just do what I say.
please.
Hello, I'm Police Constable Andy.
you're not shutting me down.
they've got food, they've got drinks, proper drinks.
and I got permission off their parents.
come on, have a look. I'm not apologising.
go and do a proper job.
I know I need a licence for a creche. I'm not thick.
this is emergency circumstances, right?
I'm not trusting the telly.
if we could have a word in private...
they're not even paying, so it can't be illegal, right? - No. I know.
it's not about the kids. I just need a word, if we could.
how many are there? - Nineteen.
but what are they doing here?
well, they're not gonna go to school. No way.
if they want 'em, they'll have to come and get 'em.
Andy: I just need a word.
they've got kids.
Ianto's niece and nephew.
save them.
do we begin?
we've got no choice.
you don't give the orders, Mr Green.
stage one.
mobilise.
I don't care who you are, you haven't got the authority to just march in here and...
mr Patel, they can't just...
they said inoculations, not...
where are you taking them?
excuse me, where are you taking them?
what's going on? What you doing?
soldier: Stay on the other side of the road. Thank you.
but my boy's in there.
taking them off the school premises, you just can't!
where are you taking them?
you can't!
that's my son! That's my bloody son!
you can't take them off the school premises!
it's okay. It's okay. Let it out.
he didn't say anything about my car, did he?
no. - Sorry.
no. There's something else.
something he wanted me to tell you. And I'm sorry, it's kind of urgent.
you can get out.
I knew Ianto properly. I've worked with him for years.
come on. Leave her alone. - No.
I did. I really... I did. We were a team.
we did all these things together.
and he'd always be fussing about his bloody coffee, yeah?
Yeah. - And he'd be talking about you.
all the time. You and the kids. And his dad.
that's Ianto, he was always so proud of his dad.
what did he say about him? about his job and things.
what job was that? - He said he was a master tailor.
he worked in Debenhams.
if Ianto gave you that old shit, then you didn't know him at all.
here you go.
Thanks.
it's started.
Jesus.
numbers?
we're looking at an uptake of about 60percent .
as predicted, a lot of the children in the target area have stayed at home.
then we'd better go and get them.
stage two.
mobilise.
I swear on my life, you have to get those kids out of this house.
is there anywhere you can take them?
I don't know, anywhere safe?
Gwen. Now, come on. - What?
they're here.
Oh, God. Look, I haven't got time to explain, okay?
but they are coming for your kids. I swear.
don't be stupid. - Shut up.
they're going to come into your house and they're going to take your kids, and I'm sorry, but you've got to believe me. That's why Ianto died, okay?
he was trying to stop them.
they're gonna come and they're gonna take your kids.
you'll never see them again.
never.
he'll be fine. The nice kids are safe.
if you're gonna get rid of 10 percent, then take the 10 percent you don't want.
all those kids on street corners, we've finally got rid of them.
while everyone else just stays indoors?
ninety percent just hugging their kids, not making a sound, just like they did before.
I don't even know your name.
I protect the state.
I was brought up to believe in and protect the state.
not much good now, are you?
even if 90 percent look the other way, what sort of world are you leaving behind?
I swear to you, if your duty is to protect the state above and beyond any other authority, then the one person you need right now is Jack Harkness.
on the floor! On the floor! Stay down!
go! Go! Go!
what's going on?
move.
captain!
go, go!
what's happening?
Lois: Captain Harkness!
here, what are you doing?
Gwen: Yeah, they're spies. Hush now, darling.
nice and quiet.
don't make a sound, just like a game, yeah?
alpha 186 to Control. Is anyone there?
fingers on lips.
now, you don't make a noise until we get there, okay?
you stay nice and quiet, and I'll get you some sweets, yeah?
where is this place? - It's down by the field. It's all boarded up.
right, look. We've got to go right now.
okay. Come on, everyone...
alpha 186 to Control. Can you hear me?
Rhiannon: We're playing spies. Now, come on. That's it. No one makes a sound.
are you coming? Andy?
control, this is Alpha 186.
what's going on?
take it easy. Take it easy, come on.
hurry, come on. Come on.
keep walking. Rhi!
what the hell are you doing?
you take them. I'm going out the front.
somebody's gotta stop them.
no, Johnny. Don't be stupid.
it's not just us, you daft sod.
Where's Richie?
go get him, get Sammy, get all the boys.
what's happening?
what is it? What's wrong? What's wrong?
all that stuff on the news, all that inoculation stuff, it's bollocks, right?
the government has sold us out.
they're coming to get our kids, and we're not getting them back, boys, right?
we got to stop them!
we got to stop them... - No!
give him back! Give him back!
Oh, it's stinking!
keep your voice down.
Yeah, what I need you to do is to be as quiet as you possibly can, like mice.
uncle Jack!
Hey, soldier.
we haven't got time!
listen. Stay with your mom, okay?
sorry. Would you...
I'll be back.
this should be everything you need. And if it's not, we'll find it.
for what?
wavelengths.
the 456 are named after a wavelength, and that's got to be the key to fighting back.
you're wasting your time.
there's nothing you can do.
I've analysed those transmissions for 40 years and never broke 'em.
what do you think, Captain?
she told me you were good.
was she right?
let's get to work.
get me access to the Torchwood software.
log on to the servers and...
welcome back.
it still won't work.
there's nothing on there. It's useless.
we've got technology way beyond you.
we hacked into Torchwood years ago, you idiot. There's nothing.
bring him over here.
dad, come and look at this.
it's some sort of pirate station.
they're trying to get the story out to the public.
but they're taking the kids.
woman: We're broadcasting this on Digital 141.
it's the kids! Tell everyone to tune in to 1 4 1.
there's one thing I always meant to ask Jack back in the old days.
I wanted to know about that Doctor of his.
all those times in history when there's no sign of him, I wanted to know why not.
but I don't need to ask any more.
I know the answer now.
sometimes the Doctor must look at this planet and turn away in shame.
I'm recording this in case anyone ever finds it, so you can see how the world ended.
you didn't mean it, did you?
about...
getting rid of it?
no, of course I didn't.
okay.
I would never... Never.
I wouldn't do that to you, sweetheart.
no, I wouldn't, and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
illegal broadcast on Digital 141. Close it down.
and take out the whole network if you have to.
we're up to 80 percent.
the people are starting to fight back.
Colonel, we're predicting 80 percent .
is that acceptable?
we have up to 80 percent of the designated children.
is that enough?
the 456: All of them.
all of the designated to us.
ODUYA: Not acceptable, sir.
we need the rest.
authorising maximum force.
the latest report from Germany.
old fashioned hard copy, I'm afraid. The system's gone into meltdown.
you don't have to be here.
it's what he would have wanted.
do you think so? I can't imagine anyone wanting to be in this bloody room.
if we cycle the wavelength back at them... - I know what you're trying to do.
a constructive wave.
do you think people aren't working on that all over the world?
but it's never going to work.
the effect would be like shouting at the 456, that's all.
just shouting.
why did Clem die?
it was the 456 that killed him.
but how did they do it? Why did they do it?
we've got the recording here.
his mind must have synced to the 456 back when he was a child.
but they didn't need to kill him. He wasn't any threat.
unless maybe that connection hurt them.
this is the 456 at the moment of his death.
we've lifted the sound from the Thames House link.
that sound, Mr Dekker, what's that sound?
I don't know. It's new.
exactly. It's new.
we don't have to analyse the wavelength, just copy it.
turn it into a constructive wave.
but we've got no way of transmitting.
of course you have.
shut up.
same way as them.
I'll find something else.
what does he mean?
don't listen to him.
Dekker, tell me.
the 456 used children to establish the resonance.
johnson: Meaning what?
we need a child.
what do you mean?
Dekker: Centre of the resonance.
Oh, that child's going to fry.
no, Dad.
no, tell them no.
johnson: One child or millions.
dad, no. Dad, tell them no!
we're running out of time.
dad, no! No, Dad!
captain!
quick.
incoming! Everybody out! Quick! Everybody out!
quick! Come on! Let's go!
quick! Come on! Quick! Come on. Quick, out.
come on. Quick, quick, quick, quick!
come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, quick.
girl: Get away! Get away!
mummy!
No! Steven!
mummy! Mummy!
my baby!
run! Run!
what are we doing, Uncle Jack?
what's happening? What do you want me to do?
Steven, get away!
No! Steven! Steven!
run! Run!
Colonel, do we have a report?
Colonel, what happened?
Colonel?
it's gone, sir.
the 456 has gone.
what did you do, clever girl?
what did you do? What did you do?
let her in.
no, no, no, no, no! No! No!
somebody help him. Help him!
no, please, no.
Why? Why?
Oh, please...
prime Minister.
the public will be wanting a statement, sir.
I suppose you could say we were lucky.
a bit soon to tell.
we don't know exactly what happened yet.
lucky with the Americans,I mean.
general Pierce took charge without ratification from the United Nations.
we can say that today's events were in American hands.
and do you think that's lucky?
Yes, I do, rather.
your first thought now is to save your own skin.
in which case, you might like to know, I paid a visit this morning, sir.
I went to see Lois Habiba.
you might remember her.
I sat with her a while. We had a number of things to discuss.
and while I was there, I used the emergency protocols to sign out a particular piece of evidence.
policeman: Thank you.
contact lenses, sir.
the Torchwood contact lenses.
and Lois was very helpful.
she told me how they worked.
I can hardly feel them, sir.
but everything that happened in this room has been recorded, sir.
all waiting to be made public, by me, including your statement just now that after the events of today you feel, as you said in your very own words, sir, lucky.
you wouldn't dare. I can have you arrested.
I don't think so.
thank you, Bridget. You're free to go.
and Miss Habiba will be released. I'll see to it myself.
I think I'll be taking charge of very many things in the days to come.
is that all, sir?
there's no more road.
we'll have to walk from now on. You all right?
you fuss over me one more time...
I'm just saying. - Well, don't.
couldn't have just chosen a pub, could you?
Rhys: It's bloody freezing. My feet.
Oh, I miss that, the Welsh complaining.
you look good. - I look huge.
she's bloody gorgeous.
you okay?
Yeah.
did it work?
travelled all sorts of places.
this planet is too small.
the whole world is like a graveyard.
come back with us.
haven't travelled far enough yet.
got a lot of dirt to shake off my shoes.
and right now, there's a cold fusion cruiser surfing the ion reefs just at the edge of the solar system, just waiting to open its transport dock.
I just need to send a signal.
they found it in the wreckage. Indestructible.
like its owner.
I put on a new strap for you.
cost me 50 quid, that. - Bill me.
are you ever coming back, Jack?
what for? - For me.
it wasn't your fault.
I think it was. - No.
steven and Ianto and Owen and Tosh and Suzie and...
all of them, because of me.
but you saved us.
didn't you?
I began to like it.
and look what I became.
still, I have lived so many lives.
it's time to find another one.
they died.
and I am sorry, Jack, but you cannot just run away.
you cannot run away.
Oh, yes, I can.
just watch me.
let's go home, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
the survival of Oswald Danes turns out to be the first incident in a much bigger story.
the amazing thing about the miracle is not that no one's dying.
it's not that the human race has become immortal.
it's that it happened to everyone at the same time.
so now what we have accumulating are people who should be dead, but aren't.
we have to start manufacturing painkillers immediately.
Jilly Kitzinger, Mr. Danes. I'm something of a talent spotter.
I don't need you. - I disagree, Mr. Danes.
someone's trying to erase Torchwood, right?
what if they're also trying to erase anyone who's ever had any contact with Torchwood?
go get him.
I have a car.
all right, just drive. Drive, drive.
what the hell is going on? - Welcome to Torchwood.
what happened to you in there?
something happened to all of us, not just me.
miracle day arrived and we all came out of it changed.
but why do you think people accept you as an expert?
I'm no expert.
but I'm a free man.
and since the miracle, the White House has said nothing.
scientists have said nothing.
I think the establishment is scared into silence.
I survived. I can say what I want.
such as?
well, is anyone paying attention to the profits that the drug companies are making?
we need drugs more than ever.
but I think we should take all those pills, those tablets and those potions and give them to people free.
Yes, that's what I'm saying, because that's how radical the world needs to be right now
free drugs, free health care, free access for all.
you really think that's practical? - Who's to say what's practical anymore?
that's pre-miracle thinking.
who told you to set me up?
Rex! P-put the gun down.
because everywhere I turn the whole C. I.A.
has been poisoned against me by you.
now who told you to do it? - I don't know what you mean.
bullshit!
you set me up, Friedkin, and you got paid to do it.
now technically we both know that I can't "kill" you.
but you see, the beauty of this miracle is if I shoot you just right, then maybe you might live in agony for...
who knows how long?
maybe 1000 years. Now you think about that.
because I've always wondered what part of the brain is memories or personality or what lets you control your own bladder.
no, don't! - Tell me!
I don't know who they are. I never did.
they just paid me over the years.
they've been there for decades and I can't-- couldn't stop them. It's too late.
look, they've
they've only ever contacted me on one telephone number.
get the number. - Yes, I know that. Thanks.
Yeah, well, hurry up. I was right about the alarm.
the police are on their way. Esther is tracking them.
uh, confirmed.
there's a unit on 5th heading for Riverdale.
north or south? - North-- I mean, heading from the north going south.
Gwen, one car from the north.
on it. Doing it.
they only contact me. They call me through that.
but listen, Rex, you won't find them.
I never did. They're everywhere.
they know everything.
well, I just have one more thing to say:
don't go deaf. - What?
you took your time.
one unit on Tacoma. Jack, you'd better move. They're right on top of you.
go go go go go!
not bad, team. Not bad at all.
what did we get? - We got a cell phone.
so whoever made the miracle, now we've got contact.
anything? Any news?
Yeah, don't worry. It's good.
they've moved Rhys and Anwen to a safe house, location unknown.
but they're in the custody of Sergeant Andy Davidson.
well, we've got his number. Have you called him?
that line's been decommissioned. I'm trying, okay?
okay, that's my bloody family, so hurry it up.
right, here we go.
found new mobiles for everyone courtesy of Jack's Cashpoint card.
I hope I didn't clear you out. - Not a chance.
that account's been gathering interest since 1906.
and some new clothes. Just some basics.
if they don't fit, then tough. Jack.
and food-- everyone is panic buying so I had to go to the petrol station and all they had was crisps.
Oh, I think you mean gas station and chips.
crisps are called chips over here. - Thank you, miss translation.
and a mobile is a cell phone and by Cashpoint I think you mean A. T.M.
don't ever leave my side. It is absolutely mental out there.
some TV show said that the miracle was a virus and then some website said it was the plague, so they all run to the shops and they clear the shelves.
Oh, and the new cult out on the street, that march...
they call themselves the soulless.
apparently everlasting life has robbed mankind of their souls.
turns out Friedkin was telling the truth.
his handset was only contacted by one number.
I traced it, but it hits a vine. - What's a vine?
a vine is when you trace a number back but the trail branches out.
then it branches out again and again, piggyback those secondary numbers spreading out almost exponentially.
so instead of tracing one number you're chasing 500, 000.
what? - You should be in the hospital.
Hey, less of the sympathy.
he can keep working, the bastard.
you're gonna keep just going on and on about your kid, huh?
do you want her here with us? Hmm?
maybe she can go play in that corner where the lead paint chips look extra tasty.
got you that from your mates, the soulless.
did you get me painkillers? - Sold out. Unlucky.
I think we should take all those pills, those tablets and those potions and give them to people free.
see, now this guy has got a good idea-- free drugs.
so who is this guy Oswald Danes?
eh, he just got lucky.
he's a convicted murderer and pedophile sentenced to death on miracle day.
all the same, he's on every channel.
we need to investigate anyone who's making a profit out of all of this.
on it. Doing it. - Go back, search family history-- everything.
I know. Thank you, I know what I'm doing.
and this lemonade-- this lemonade is flat.
it's lemonade. It's supposed to be flat.
what, fizzy fizzy lemonade?
it's fizzy in the U. K. And flat in the U. S.
hmm, just about sums it up. - How are we doing on the money?
I can't trace where the bribes came from but I'm going through Friedkin's patterns of behavior instead.
he's a section chief. You're not getting into those files.
Oh really? You want to bet?
this Torchwood software, it's serious.
what are you doing with that?
nothing. I'm just putting my numbers in.
whose numbers?
my sister's.
you're gonna phone your sister?
no.
Esther, what the hell is the matter with you?
don't you know how serious this is?
the C. I.A. is gonna be monitoring her calls.
I'm sorry, okay? - Well, think next time.
come on, Rex. She's not used to this.
I'm not used to this either. It doesn't make me stupid.
that's enough, okay?
and who the hell put you in charge?
I think the C. I.A. did.
you're a member of Torchwood now whether you like it or not.
I'm sorry, okay? I really am. I just
I've never done all this before.
you guys have. I sit at my desk and read blogs for a living.
Rex, it's my sister. She's just-- she's not well.
Yeah, it's irrelevant.
I tried to do a search on morphic fields, 'cause that's the best that I could work out, that some sort of morphic field suspended the human race.
but it's got to be more than that. - What do you mean?
it's like there's some sort of energy behind this
a will, a drive, a consciousness.
cause this miracle, it's more than people just surviving.
they are so alive.
you saw Lyn, that woman at the airport.
she should have been paralyzed but she just kept on going.
and I've seen bodies at the morgue, burnt and broken, still alive, staring right at me.
they weren't even allowed to be unconscious.
it's as if something is willing them to go on, each and every individual forced into life.
that was me...
all the way through my accident
wide awake.
and you could feel everything that happened? It still hurt?
Yeah.
so what did the search say?
that's the problem.
everybody's had the same idea.
morphic field...
gets 10 million results.
then I'll go through them, all 10 million.
see, that's what I do when I'm at my desk.
hard work.
I know.
he cockblocked the A. T.F.
I have no idea what any of that means.
the A. T.F. Is the Bureau of Alcohol,
tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
they asked the C. I.A. about information on a warehouse here in Washington, but Friedkin forwarded the request onto ancillary three times.
what's ancillary?
it's a paper chase. It's a guaranteed way to lose something in the system.
so if he tried to stop people from seeing the warehouse, then maybe he was paid to protect it, which would indicate there's something in there.
it's at 3rd and Boston Southwest.
all right, so we've got a mission.
first thing we need to do is steal a new car.
so who's giving the orders?
okay, Torchwood, what do you say?
we need to steal a new car.
got one.
there's somebody's dry-cleaning back here.
and it's my size. I'm taking these.
my clothes are stinking.
ladies, avert your eyes. That includes you, World War II.
these new phones aren't bad. The camera is good quality too.
I know you didn't just take a picture of me changing my pants.
you're changing your pants? - Pants mean trousers.
are we really on a mission here?
yeah well, maybe this is the way Torchwood does things, mate.
yeah well, maybe you want to drive on the other side of the street, mate.
3rd and Boston. That's the one.
security profile says the guard's on a quarterly rotation.
that means he checks in with base every 15 minutes starting on the hour.
all right, so we gonna come up with a plan, or is that just the American thing to do?
I wonder, can you help? - sure.
we're a little bit lost. Sorry.
the British abroad, hopeless, honestly.
I think we're trying to get to Boston Avenue.
is it Boston-- Boston Road or Boston
is it Boston Street?
you've done that before. - So many times.
Esther, how much time do we have?
11 minutes.
I can unlock it but only by tricking it into thinking it's booting up for the day.
that means all the lights are gonna come on, all the computers are gonna boot up.
do it. - Esther, you keep watch.
right.
done.
let's see what's in this.
let me see that.
huh. It's drugs.
it's legitimate drugs. - What is it?
Metanec. Metanec is a painkiller, yeah?
Hallelujah.
thousands of them. Millions of them.
Phicorp. - Yeah, you know Phicorp, Jack.
Phicorp's a big pharmaceutical company.
we got Phicorp back home. I mean, it's everywhere. It's worldwide.
these are the same pills that I've been taking.
the beauty of it is that they're non-narcotic.
they keep you painless and wide awake.
it's the perfect drug for the new world order.
there was a delivery yesterday.
when was the first one?
way back.
Oh, hold on.
deliveries go back at least a year.
all for drugs.
all from Phicorp.
Oh my God.
bigger on the inside than the outside.
these are all painkillers?
they're ready for a war.
no.
they were ready for the miracle.
Phicorp knew it was coming.
you, come here.
this woman's husband strangled her.
she doesn't die so he keeps strangling her.
and now her brain is soup and her hyoid bone
her neck is like dust and you're telling me that's not murder?
we've charged him with assault. - That's not enough!
this is what murder looks like now.
don't blame me. We're not even allowed to say "attempted murder" anymore because murder is impossible.
the whole system is breaking down.
it's the N. I.H. They say you're late for some kind of panel.
I'm looking at an additional half million people a day.
what's up?
the 50% of pregnancies that spontaneously abort are not aborting. Genetic mistakes are suddenly viable.
no baby is a mistake.
what hospital are you from?
providence. Dr. Carey Murphy.
Yeah, I was a Catholic too once. I got better.
we're talking brain outside the skull, no skin, no face, suffering.
Yeah, these are mistakes.
Oh hell. Oh hell. Sorry.
but actually, I think we can help.
Jilly Kitzinger. Hi.
pain management in newborns is something that we've already got going on at Phicorp, so we can roll out a strategy.
fine, we've got a bigger problem.
somebody got off a plane from New Delhi in Boston last night and now we've got cholera. I warned you.
I seem to recall no shortage of clean water in Boston.
turn on a tap, gentlemen.
can we talk about the situation in the E. R.s?
I'm gonna keep warning you. We're gonna see more of this every day.
we're not done with the birth issue, guys.
they're putting contraceptives in the water supply in India, mainland China. That's something we might have to look at here.
that's not a serious proposition?
it doesn't matter what happens in the long term if we lose the heart of our health care system now.
we need more facilities, more space, but who's gonna organize it?
we'll put it on the agenda, but I think we're getting pretty far off track here.
can we talk about the contraception option with some professional distance, please?
it's been raining on and off...
like it wasn't end of the worldly enough.
we don't deserve this miracle.
we're just gonna screw it up like we always do.
human damn beings. I'm including myself.
Phicorp needs feedback from medical staff.
why don't you come and talk to us?
my schedule is a little full.
okay. That's fine.
but you gave a commencement speech last year at Columbia about your college mentor, how she worked for Doctors Without Borders when they were just starting out in Biafra.
and you said you wanted to find a way to give back like she did.
did you find that?
I-- I was talking about field work.
everything is field work now.
I mean, FEMA-- FEMA is hopeless.
it's a pot of glue that still thinks it's a racehorse.
Phicorp can really do something.
you're just out to make a profit.
well, companies profit by turning situations around to their advantage.
but isn't that how every human damn being gets through their day?
come in and say hello.
just once.
maybe. - I'll take that as a yes.
Oh God. I've got to go.
busy busy. But you have my card.
you won't regret it.
and that's a promise.
okay, we do a deep search on this Phicorp.
I want to peel back security and find everything.
I can handle company history. - I can do European operations.
whoa whoa whoa. Wait a minute.
after we do all this research, then what do we do?
we go in, whether that means infiltration or confrontation.
so we're just gonna sit on this information?
come on, guys, seriously?
I mean, we've got a major link between an international corporation and the miracle and we're just gonna keep it to ourselves?
we got this far on our own.
Yeah, but see, it's not just about us.
not anymore. This is about doing the right thing - for the state and for the people. - Jack, he's got a point.
okay.
we need a friend with connections. Got any ideas?
all right, my senior instructor at Langley
I'm pretty sure he'd still give me a chance.
he's C. I.A. - He's ex-C. I.A.
look, I know this is a risk. I know that.
but it's a risk I'm willing to take. So what do you say?
okay.
okay.
and I've got proof.
I've got photographs and documentation.
but I can't compromise you or your family, sir.
you know I would never do that.
so maybe we could meet somewhere neutral.
how about the lobby of the Freeville Hotel?
it's on North Street West. The Freeville Hotel.
damn.
what's the use?
we discovered this Phicorp shit, but everyone's been turned against us.
we're still on the run. We can't trust anyone.
they can't have gotten to everyone we know and they can't be tracking the cell phones, 'cause they're new.
I warned you. Whoever these people are, they're good and they're ready for us.
which puts us back at square one
we tackle Phicorp ourselves.
and is that standard Torchwood policy?
I suppose it is, yeah.
you know, you dress like it's World War II, so I don't expect you to be up on current events, but there is no Torchwood.
it's dead. Gone.
buried. - It's us.
as far as I can see, you got all your staff killed.
they were my friends. - Your dead friends.
Rex, don't.
Rex, don't.
you want me to stop? I'll stop.
who the hell are you people anyway?
Rex, hold on. Hold on.
we're got to work together on this, Rex.
don't, Rex. Don't.
don't! Rex!
the city is going wild.
everyone's out drinking.
nobody knows whether it's a party or a wake.
my arm is itching. - Poor baby.
I think it's infected. - You're worse than Rhys.
it's itching because it's healing. Now stop it, Jack.
Oi, Jack.
mortal man, mortal needs.
we've got work to do.
I am so mortal.
Hey, baby. What's up?
there's a poem
I have been one acquainted with the night.
I have walked out in rain and back in rain.
it's probably not about walking.
I suppose it's about death.
Yeah.
the poets are the ones who are really gonna suffer, aren't they?
all those poems about death.
well, it was Robert Frost, so maybe it really was just about walking.
my apartment's that way.
10 minutes down the freeway, turn off at 11th.
home. - You'd be arrested on the spot.
and that'd be worse than this?
I'd be safe, be warm.
wouldn't be holding you back.
I don't know if I can do this.
what's wrong with your sister?
she's not sick. She just...
can't cope.
never could. I'm the youngest but I've always looked after her.
well, she's in that direction.
but I'm warning you, you give up now and you'll prove that Rex was right.
can't have that.
no, we can't.
miles to go before we sleep.
scotch.
what are these? - Sobriety chips.
got two-month chips, six-month chips.
they got a whole bowl of 10-year chips around here somewhere.
people are throwing a lot of sober out the window tonight.
sorry I can't add to your collection, unless you want a button.
Oh, you damage that coat, I'm jumping over this bar to protect it.
Jack.
you like the coat?
Brad. Passionately.
what's the latest from the White House, Candace?
are we getting any sort of clarity?
well, off the record, George, this miracle is so impossible a lot of high level officials are thinking the word "alien,
...meaning an intervention or at least an influence from beyond this world.
but so far still, no one is willing to say it out loud.
well, bringing the discussion back down from outer space, we saw some action today.
to the life sentences of convicted criminals, because these days, how long is life?
right, the argument is that a life sentence is now potentially infinite.
tomorrow we've got Oswald Danes in our Atlanta studio.
it's okay?
for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised "incorruptible, "and we shall be changed.
for this corruptible body must put on incorruption, "and this mortal shall put on immortality.
so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, "and the mortal shall have put on immortality, "then shall be brought to pass the saying "which is written: 'Death shall be swallowed up in victory.
o death, where is thy sting?
o grave, where is thy victory?'
Dr. Juarez.
I'm gonna need you to dress this again.
and I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist.
Oh, damn it.
I'm gonna need your help
you know, medicine and care
just until I clear my name.
I'm just taking your word for it that you're not a traitor.
Oh yeah.
but, you know, you've already given me drugs, taken me into your home.
we both have the power to make a case against one another.
nice. - Yeah.
so what you're saying is that's what our relationship comes down to, blackmail.
no.
when you put it that way, it's kind of hot.
I'm exhausted.
me too.
do you have protection?
what for?
can't die now. Don't need nothing in-between.
that's not how it works anymore.
a lifetime of regret just got even longer, that's all.
fine.
you're calling the shots.
Yes.
yes I am.
Ouch. - Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay. Come on.
the sting of death is sin, "and the sake of sin is the law.
but thanks be to God, "which giveth us our victory "through our lord Jesus Christ.
Hey. Hey!
I was just leaving. Just leaving.
Carla, is this the guy? - It's him.
no, you got me mistaken with somebody else.
Oswald Danes, the child killer. - No.
if you don't want to be recognized, don't put your face on TV!
let's get him.
officer! That kid, he's harassing me.
Oh, not fair, man. You know who you got there?
look at him. - It's a mistake.
I think you should go home, sir. - That's Oswald Danes.
do you know what he said about the girl, the one he killed?
she should have run faster." That's what he said.
go home right now.
thank you. Thank you very much.
I-- I'm just trying to get back to my motel.
do you think you could give me a lift?
it's just off 278.
Yeah, get in.
thank you.
what? Is there a problem here, officer?
you can get out, sir.
Oh shit.
all right. Of course.
of course. Here we go.
here we go.
don't you worry, sir. Nothing on your face.
you'll still be nice and handsome for the TV.
you should have run faster, Oswald.
are you saying the pharmaceutical companies knew it was gonna happen?
only one company-- Phicorp.
you okay?
my-- my mother had a massive stroke last year.
I-- I had to make a choice.
God, if I'd just kept her alive a little longer.
if I had been warned.
they even gave me their card.
Phicorp. Some woman called Kitzinger.
she wants me to go to some kind of private meeting.
well, you know you have to go and find out more.
I need to know what they're doing.
Rex, that's your job, not mine.
what? Hey, listen, I'm serious.
I need you to do this.
you break in here, threaten to expose me for helping you and now you want me to, what, spy for you?
Yeah, will you? - No.
Phicorp knew, Vera.
okay? They could have warned us. Think about your mother.
I mean, you let her die
I'm taking a shower.
let yourself out.
and I don't need to see you again.
Gwen, I had to call.
I thought of a thing.
are you drunk? - A little.
you?
some of us have to work.
your turn to talk.
I know.
I was thinking about how you're immortal...
and I'm dying.
and what I wanted to say was...
we're good, aren't we?
you and me.
a good team.
I missed you.
I was thinking if this had happened a bit sooner...
I know. - ...He'd still be here-- Ianto.
dead friends.
I'm sorry.
I wish he was here now.
not much of a team, is it?
but we've still got each other.
you and me.
just like the old days.
we don't need anyone, do we?
sorry. - We don't need Rex.
I had to bounce a signal off Paraguay, but it's to say thanks.
Oh my God. Rhys, oh my God.
can you see me? I can see you. Can you see me?
Yes, I can see you. A little bit too much of you, not enough baby.
put up the baby. - Hey.
give your mom a wave.
we don't need anyone.
right, Gwen?
Hello, little sweetheart.
Hey, mommy, look. - Hello, darling.
we're safe and we escaped. We're fine, I promise.
and I'll be home as soon as I can. I will.
Andy said he can move us with police supervision back to Swansea, so we're all ready and waiting for you.
Hey, it's mom. It's mom.
Hello, mom.
rough night, Oswald?
Oh God. What was it?
was it Jill? No, let me guess. Jillian?
Jilly. Jilly Kitzinger.
told you you'd need me.
now we have a very important meeting to go to, so you can get cleaned up on the plane to Dulles.
dulles? Why?
these are the times that make men, Oswald.
so it's your choice
stay where you are or stand up tall and stride across the skin of the world.
which is it?
well, let's see.
if that's a promise of help, you'd better deliver,
miss Jilly Kitzinger.
I will, sir. I promise.
I'll hold you to it.
lead on.
yeah?
you left me your number 'cause you knew I'd give in.
okay, I'm not the C. I.A.
I don't go undercover, but maybe I can get you inside.
Yes!
I feel awful, which is amazing.
I thought we broke up.
yeah well, there's work to be done.
so they just look like contact lenses, huh?
Mm-hmm. Look at the laptop.
they're the one piece of Torchwood tech I kept.
it's like a camera. See? Okay.
side... - Huh.
...to side. See?
that's very very cool. Where'd you get it from?
a distant moon of a distant star.
really, where'd you get them from?
a distant moon of a distant star.
I am loving this hangover.
I knew mortality would make life more intense. Ow!
Hey, don't touch my pills. I need that for legitimate pain.
I need them too. - You weren't impaled.
you should have seen the other guy.
Oh, that face.
Rex doesn't like his jokes too gay.
no, Rex doesn't like men in their 40s acting like they're 20.
Oh, we've got a winner. Now hush.
Esther is sending me text.
so we can communicate with the I-5s just by typing.
Hello, Esther. I'm Gwen.
but there's no sound.
but we've got lip-reading software.
look at me. Right at me.
Mm-hmm. - Now say something.
my name is Rex Matherson - representing the Central Intelligence Agency. - My name is Rex Matherson representing the Central Intelligence Agency.
all right, all right. That'll work.
I can get inside with those. - Problem.
the I-5s, they're isomorphic, biometrically tuned in to me and me alone.
Seriously? - Mm-hmm.
if anyone's going on this mission, it's got to be me.
Yup. What? - Huh?
we very much appreciate your coming.
Phicorp knows how busy you must be.
no, I don't think this is right.
I was here to see a Miss Kitzinger.
no, this is the meeting.
I think you may know some of these people.
Shelby Lewis, she made the shortlist for the Lasker Prize.
okay.
we're starting in five.
Oh, if you'll excuse me.
first door on your left. - Thank you.
Where's Rex? - No, I'm not Rex, I know.
hello. Long story. Go back to the meeting and keep Jilly Kitzinger for as long as you can. Go.
are you giving me orders? - Yes, go.
she did good, Dr. Juarez. - Yeah.
how did you talk her into it?
well, it's not exactly a professional relationship.
what's he doing there? - Tell her to follow Oswald.
no no. No way.
let her stay on the mission.
Gwen find out anything about Oswald Danes?
nothing special, apart from being a monster.
he just chose the right day to be executed on.
he's got nothing to do with this stuff.
I'm sorry, no. I have been forgiven by
a substantial number of people have forgiven me.
I can feel that in my heart, in my guts.
and forgiveness, it's like a tide or storm. It clears the air.
I'm very lucky to have been forgiven, and I feel very-- I feel very blessed.
and I think of forgiveness as a cure.
gentlemen, Mr. Danes.
yeah?
who was that woman?
she works for me. Are you at the meeting yet?
Yeah, but it's not a meeting. It's some kind of presentation.
all right, well, keep the line open. I want to hear.
Hello, and thank you for coming.
I'm Congressman Patrick Morganthall.
some of you are listening to us from Los Angeles...
a Congressman. - ...Others from Phicorp locations in Cleveland,
dc, Dallas, Singapore, Hong Kong...
Phicorp was ready worldwide.
but if they knew about the miracle, does that mean they caused it?
our modern drug prescription system has served us very well for many decades, but times have changed.
times have changed a great deal.
the need for drugs is far outstripping the access to the people with the means to prescribe them.
something has got to change.
and that is why later today I will be introducing legislation to make all prescription drugs, all painkillers, antibiotics
almost all medications available without a prescription.
think it'll, what, multiply sales by tenfold?
try 1, 000. They're cashing in big time.
Where's Jack?
and I am not just talking about making new laws.
I am talking about making an entirely new society.
now this is a massive enterprise, ladies and gentlemen.
but it's up to us. All of you are experts...
Jilly just left. - Oh shit!
call her. Call Jilly Kitzinger.
Dr. Juarez, hello.
it's Vera. I'm in the screening room.
I have some-- can you come here?
can I ask you some questions? - Sure.
sure. Is everything all right? You sound kind of shaky.
good work, Gwen Cooper.
you gonna get that? - It's not mine.
they're calling Friedkin. - Or they're calling us. Go go.
yeah?
Hello?
who's there?
who are you?
who am I talking to?
who is this?
nothing.
it hits a vine.
but they could have traced that handset.
Yeah, I know. Come on, we gotta get the hell out of here, out of D. C.
pack that stuff up quick.
what are you smiling for?
I think we got 'em worried.
let's go.
and let's find out where the hell Jack went.
okay, you ready for me?
Yeah, sure.
I'd apologize for being late, but it wasn't my fault.
I was needed across town.
still made it.
and this will be going on live, yes?
can you tell me who's interviewing me?
Yeah, it's, uh...
SOD it.
I suppose a man like you was always on his way.
you met with Phicorp today. Why?
you'll have to ask them.
did they mention the name Jack Harkness?
have you heard that name?
never.
why do you ask, Jack?
I figured if you cared that much about the name, it was probably yours.
I just want you to talk.
what about?
I saw you on television saying you feel forgiven for taking the life of a child.
that's a lie. I know that's a lie.
how do you know that, Jack, - with such certainty? - Tell the truth!
the murder of Susie Cabina, you don't feel sorry at all.
Oh, the truth is she flaunted it
her innocence.
most people, they get hit or whatever, it's hours before the bruises rise up.
but they showed right away with her.
it was like
I was painting on her.
and she looked so beautiful.
I thought it couldn't get any better than that.
but, oh, Jack, I swear to you, right then at the end
I felt her life leave and she left through me.
Yeah.
you know that feeling?
I think you do.
and I relive it every single night, because that was the best moment of my life.
now I understand.
you're doing all this 'cause you're searching for one thing
one simple thing:
execution.
we're without death so you get to live.
and it's killing you.
Jack, what are you going to do with that recording?
we're in a broadcast center.
figure I might broadcast it.
excellent idea.
if only I didn't have to do this.
boys.
take that recording off him. - Ah! God!
I did visit Phicorp and they were kind enough to offer me protection.
in exchange for what?
the message.
don't hurt him, just get rid of him.
it was nice to meet you, Jack Harkness.
well, you can hurt him a little, but not the face.
that's how it's done these days.
let me be clear.
I'm not calling for free drugs.
I'm calling for free access to drugs.
I want every American to have the power to be able to buy whatever they want and need without a prescription.
if that means that some drug companies are gonna make a profit, then maybe that just ensures that they'll take better care of us.
because government has abandoned us.
and I'm thinking of companies like Phicorp.
they'd never abandon us, because they need us.
we're talking about medications.
I have to say that I'm somewhat of an expert.
I spent a lot of long years in solitary confinement, a dangerous man companies like Phicorp tried to help.
they put me on a drug regime - with every drug known in the world. - Did you see him in there?
did you see Oswald Danes?
did you touch to him?
did I what? - Oswald.
did you touch him?
they stick with us.
and I'm asking you now to join with me and this great enterprise as we all walk across the fragile skin of this wide world together.
the future is now endless and it's terrifying.
I'm offering you my hand to walk on this long journey together.
walk with me.
that's all I ask.
walk with me.
we're missing a few seconds of Teller outside of room six.
ten minutes later he was dead.
Sheri, what can you tell me about the patient in room six?
Jake keeps going AWOL and ending up there.
wondering who's inside.
no one. The room's empty.
they say that the shortest path between two points is a straight line.
but what happens if that path gets blocked?
when sediment impedes the flow of a river, it redirects...
zigging and zagging instead of following a straight course.
you but
what looks to the crow like meandering, is to the water the most efficient route from source to outlet.
nature finds a detour.
sir! Sir, sir, excuse me.
I think you dropped something.
ham radio has what, three working parts?
I told them the tube was loose but nobody listens.
Thanks, though. - You're welcome.
when two points are destined to touch but a direct connection is impossible...
the universe will always find another way.
would you mind watching Jake. I forgot his... hat.
come on, guys. Let's light a fire.
are you okay?
Yeah, about a year ago I took Jake to the Science Museum.
I spent the better part of three hours trying to talk him out of a stall in the men's room.
I'm just not sure about today.
for you to even have a dog in the custody fight against your sister-in-law,
Jake's gonna need to show progress.
right now he lives in a world of his own making.
experiences like today push the boundaries, but we don't grow if we stay comfortable.
we're not just talking about Jake now, are we?
Clea, you guys coming or what?
okay, buddy. You ready?
it's time to get going.
what is it?
the pattern.
the company your sister-in-law works for.
aster Corps. It's the same symbol.
it can't be a coincidence that Jake keeps landing on a triangle.
okay, buddy, stay where I can see you.
good, all seven present and accounted for.
that's right, we're one down.
I keep forgetting room six is still empty.
who did you say was in there last?
I didn't.
Jake, stop!
I'm so sorry. My son, he runs away from me.
not to worry. I remember when mine was that age.
enjoy the museum. - Thank you.
check it out. She's waving at that boy. She can see him.
I read about this, it's a live shot of Paris.
this isn't my phone. 555-0101?
Hello?
I'm sorry. Look, I think I have a pretty good idea how this happened.
my son must have picked it up.
we're in the first exhibit hall. We'll wait for you here.
you're welcome.
what are the chances you had something to do with that?
Oh, my God.
Jake, it's all right, buddy.
we'll just go look at something else. I spy something red.
I'll get her back. - Okay.
just calm down. Jake, Okay, it's gonna be all right.
Jake... - Yeah, I can see you. Can you see me?
Jake, I'll take care of this.
I'm sorry to bother you, but could you ask your friend to grab the lady with the red coat?
please, it's important.
he needs to speak to the woman in the red coat.
see, buddy, look, someone's going to get her.
Jake, please...
see, buddy? She came back.
Jake, I don't know what you want me to do right now.
here she is.
Hello? I'm sorry... I don't speak French.
I do.
excuse me. I think you have my phone.
I'm so sorry, my son has a thing for cell phones.
that's okay. - Thank you.
excuse me...
by any chance is your name... Simrin?
Yes. I'm sorry, do I know you?
no, but I think she does.
I'm sorry. This can't be happening. I'm so sorry.
no. No.
what the hell just happened?
she says... she thinks that was her mother.
but her mother died 21 years ago.
all she got was one picture and her mother's name.
sounds pretty far-fetched. It's been more than 20 years.
I told you before, these numbers, patterns, they're not just coincidence.
are i know
she says... Simrin isn't a common Indian name.
the birthmark on her cheek. She's the right age.
damn it.
I want to follow the road map, I do.
but there isn't a number this time and I don't understand what the triangles mean.
and today's a really important day for us, too.
I-I just can't leave.
maybe Clea's right. I mean, we can't be certain that this is her mother.
I mean, it's been 20 years.
it's her mother.
how can you be sure? - I just am.
you look after Jake. Tell her I'm gonna try and find her.
hello Tri-Borough drivers, you fine specimens of humanity.
that's right, Sal Slaykoff is back from breakfast...
and it was delicious. Thanks for asking.
funny thing happened to me on my way back from Diego's Chicken and Waffle House.
total stranger took a moment out of his busy day to do me a solid.
found something I'd lost.
we're all moving forward in this big, crazy world.
each of us in our own little box.
wouldn't kill you to make a bit of human contact.
keep that in mind next time you pick up a fare.
anybody copy?
what am I talking to myself here?
growing tell what that no my he
Veronique... my God, what?
he he deserves no after to i
finding her alive would change everything.
hey oh we you are orbiting did i love love.
I spent that on the try and smart
Hey, Ipolita.
the suit with your comm gear is taking the next space walk.
Gratzi, Allegra.
look if you stop what you are who i it is the expert dont a few you you are my ready?
ready.
damn it.
Jake. What the hell are you doing?
this running off has to stop. It is not safe.
I tried to find her, okay?
I couldn't; I'm sorry.
we need to go back inside before they notice that we're gone, okay?
come on. Now.
tell me Jake's with you.
Yeah, I've got him.
we're on our way back.
sweetheart, what is it? - Is he all right?
Yes, thank you; he's fine.
you free?
jackass.
you'll make two stops before dropping me off at JFK.
I have a 10-2 at 35th and Ninth.
copy, that's your last fare of the day.
Jake, I don't know what you want me to do.
I tried to find her, but I couldn't.
you know what? I've got an idea.
Clea. - Hey, it's me.
the mother, Simrin, her cell phone...
when it rang, do you remember what I said the incoming call was?
it-it started with 555.
I think it was 0101?
I think that's it. 555-0101.
Yeah, I think that's what it was.
look, I want to try something. We're gonna be a minute; okay, thanks.
hotel Trio, how may I help you?
come on, buddy.
excuse me, I'm looking for a woman. She called me earlier from the hotel.
Hey, little man. Are you lost?
I'm sorry, it's my son. I'll take care of it.
nice job on the SARJ inspection.
install your camera, and we'll move on.
what? No smoke break?
you want to wrap this up in under six hours,
I suggest you head to S1 zenith for the RPCM swap.
Roger that.
give me a glove check.
pristine.
good,'cause one cut could really put a damper on your day.
says the woman sitting inside.
translating.
can you verify the HUD compares well with the DCM?
okay, I know men aren't known for their multitasking abilities, but I really need a check on your suit's data. How do you read?
Gio, do you read me?
Gio, do you read me?
um, sorry, is there something I can help you with, sir?
Veronique, right? - I'm sorry, my name is Nandu.
how is that possible? I just saw you...
are you a guest in this hotel? - No, no, no, please just hear me out.
I think I met your sister, your twin sister.
I'm sorry, I'm an only child.
look, I'll just call the front desk.
wait, do you have any family in France? Paris?
no, I was born in India and I moved here before I was one.
please, just call your mother.
her name's Simrin, right?
how do you know my mother's name?
she lost her cell phone, I found it. She called me from this hotel.
I know this sounds crazy, but I think I'm supposed to reunite you and your sister.
I told you, I-I don't have a sister.
what if I can prove to you that you do?
dont
there you are.
Where's Jake and Mr. Bohm?
uh, checking out an exhibit upstairs.
well, we're taking off in 20.
don't want to be late for the surprise back at the Board & Care.
the exhibit, the video wall, it's sponsored by the same group that donated the Beta-tablets to Board & Care, Aster Corps.
is it?
I hadn't noticed.
where are you? We're leaving in 20 minutes.
I know, I know, look, I need you to call Veronique.
I have her on the other line. - Okay, good.
I want you to ask her where she was born; the more specific, the better.
okay, give me one second.
in a town called Akaltara. - Okay, thanks.
you said you left India before you were one?
were you born in a town called Akaltara?
it's just got to be a coincidence.
ask Veronique what her birth date is.
may 1, 1991.
that's your birthday, isn't it? You share the same birthday; you're from the same town.
there are coincidences, and there are truths.
for some reason, I was meant to connect you and your sister today.
please, just let me take you to her.
sometimes twins share allergies.
ask Veronique if she's allergic to something.
you're scaring me. - Don't leave, ple...
she's allergic to strawberries.
damn it.
we're on our way back.
Jake, we need to go back to the museum, or I'm gonna be in really big trouble.
I apologize again for having to meet on the fly, as they say, but, um, I wouldn't want to miss my flight.
no, of course not.
you're a miracle worker, Dr. Knox.
Oh, well, there's a great deal of suffering in the world, but if I can help to ease even one person's pain, well, then I've served a greater purpose.
when we spoke on the phone...
Oh, right. Of course.
by this time next week, you will be a different woman.
Hey, 5:30 a. m.
shift, la, la, la. That's the fat lady singing.
you're shift's up; time to bring those rides home.
hang up your keys, take a shower, hit the bodega on the way home and buy some flowers for the wife.
fly free, little birds.
I'm stuck here in this cage.
let me live vicariously through you.
nobody listens.
tell her I'm sorry.
but the phone number? Didn't you reach Simrin?
it's complicated.
I'm allergic to strawberries.
is it possible that we have met?
maybe I've driven you before.
doubtful.
I avoid this city like the plague.
I'm here on business for the day, that's all.
what is it you do?
obstetrician.
work can be difficult when you're away from the family.
for every man shall bear his own burden.
that's what I used to tell my little one.
although she is not so little anymore.
Yeah, I'll tell you what, why don't you just focus on the road so I don't have to pretend to be interested in anything you have to say.
I lied to Sheri.
after Jake slipped out, she asked where you are.
come on, troops. Drop your stuff and meet up at the rec room.
we got a surprise for you.
did she buy it? - Yeah.
but for the rest of the day, she needs to see you here.
Jake's evaluation hearing is just around the corner.
I know, I know. No more meltdowns.
seeing... Veronique and Nandu together today, it was...
the way it should be. I know.
I... better go help Sheri. - Okay. We'll be right in.
come on, buddy, it's our turn.
thank you.
what am I missing?
Jake, the triangles. I know. We did that.
they were the triangle, and we brought them together.
isn't that what you wanted me to do?
Jake... Jake, just calm down.
I just don't know if I can do this.
it's a fait accompli.
I-if anyone ever found out...
and how would they do that?
I mean, there's no ties binding you to me, me to her, us to them.
why do you think I had you meet me here?
like I said... no ties.
we're playing with people's lives.
well, you should've considered that before you cashed the check.
1604, this is dispatch. Your shift ended 20 minutes ago.
service is waiting on your vehicle.
listen... you're right not to be taking the situation lightly.
we're not God, but...
have no doubt that we are helping people.
you... are helping people.
pull over.
my esteemed colleague will be getting out here.
then you can take me to JFK, International Departures.
CAPCOM comm check. Gio, do you read?
he's too focused on the task.
Allegra, do you have visual? - Negative.
it's possible Gio translated into an area where structures are blocking your signals.
readjustment already in process.
go ahead and keep your scheduled rendezvous.
are you kidding me?
I think the current situation warrants I cancel and continue to try and...
we'll assume I. V.from the ground.
take another stab at reestablishing comm.
Roger that.
we're about to join a Webcast being streamed to schools and libraries all across the country.
now, seeing that we spent the day at the museum exploring space,
I figured why not bring a little space home with us.
we good to go?
Hello, Earth.
greetings from the International Space Station.
my name is Allegra, and my partner Gio and I have spent the past two and a half months up here working on a range of space observation studies.
we also do housekeeping.
and that's where Gio is right now, actually.
he's outside, fixing a piece of the ISS-- that's kind of like a circuit breaker.
I know that he would love to talk to you himself, but unfortunately, communication is down temporarily.
comm blackouts are normal.
as a matter of fact, once every orbit, the ISS loses all contact with Earth as we pass through the Zone of Exclusion.
it's kind of like when you wear earbuds to tune out your parents.
okay, today's topic is radio communication.
currently, I am orbiting 400 kilometers above Earth, while simultaneously talking to a capsule communicator in Houston and our Webcast server in New York
three distinct, individual points, connected.
these two... by 5, 191 miles.
we call it "triangulation.
in this case, an isosceles triangle where two sides are identical.
that's because right now, at this very moment, the distance between the ISS and Houston - and the ISS in New York is exactly the same. - 5191
what? - May 1, 1991.
that's Veronique and Nandu's birthday, Who can figure out, remember?
.based on my two equidistant sides, what the missing piece of my triangle is?
the top angle is 18 degrees.
cat's cradle and the triangles are what brought us here, but the number that she's talking about, that's what Jake wants me to know, that's why he was still playing the game.
did anybody get that?
what does it mean? - I don't know yet.
the only people that do are part of the triangle.
I need to talk to Veronique or Nandu. I need to go.
but... Sheri, she's watching.
you want to see another meltdown?
I don't have a choice.
I'm gonna have to cut our chat short, kids.
I hope that someday I'm down there talking with one of you up here.
Ciao.
Houston, are you getting this?
extravehicular One's reading elevated for CO2.
we have to purge his suit immediately or he'll enter hypercapnia.
please tell me you've regained comm.
negative. Comm is still down.
I need to know if the number 1604 means anything to you or your sister.
how did you...
Yeah, my father, he's a taxi driver. It's his medallion number.
I'm gonna need to speak with your father, please. It's important.
I was reduced to some pathetic hand-holding, but the transaction's complete.
I'm off to Korea right now to shore up the third package.
problem?
please. These people are desperate.
what part of JFK did you fail to grasp?
I know who you are.
and I know what you're doing.
I'll call you back.
Ah, yes.
every so often I run into one of you people.
so you do, eh?
you do remember me?
no.
but, then, I'm terrible with faces.
I won't let what happened to my family happen again.
I'm taking you to the police.
we can't put spilled milk back in its bottle, brother.
you are a leech... feeding off people's desperation.
it's wrong!
you made me give up my child.
I furnish a service, nothing more.
I'm simply a conduit, providing people with the...happy lives they deserve.
now, the best thing for all concerned would be for you to finish your fare and then go about your life.
my life?
you took my life from me.
every action has its consequence.
No!
how can I possibly face her?
it's too late.
20 years of a lie.
how could she ever forgive me?
I can't promise you that she will.
but your daughters are reunited, and there's nothing that you can change about the past, but the future...that's an entirely different story.
it's a beautiful name.
Yeah.
how did this happen?
we were just 18 when Simrin discovered she was pregnant.
we couldn't look after ourselves, let alone a child.
we hitch-hiked to a free clinic when she went into labor.
an hour later, we had Nandu.
pink and healthy.
wait, you didn't know there were twins?
not until the doctor told Simrin to get ready to push again.
we could scarcely provide food and shelter for one child, but two?
he said... he could give our baby a better life, and with the money he could give us we could move far away, start over.
he wouldn't even let us hold our baby.
so we packed our bags and we moved to New York.
the secret we carried, it tore us apart.
he took our daughter for profit.
and now he's doing it again.
what do you mean?
I didn't recognize him at first, but with each stop we made, everybody he spoke to, the plans he was making for today, I realized...
the doctor who sold Veronique on the black market, he was sitting in the back of my taxi today.
he was mapping the sale of another child, like he was making a grocery run.
you're absolutely positive?
you're certain that that was the same man? - Yes.
I thought I could... stop him from destroying another family.
but I failed my daughters all over again today.
where did you drop him off?
we didn't make it that far, but he was going to JFK.
I need to know every stop you made with this man.
EV1's metabolic rate is rising.
we'll have to get him to airlock and terminate for high CO2 levels or...
ev's are trained to recognize the symptoms of euphoria.
he could make his way back under his own steam.
you don't know Gio.
Ipolita. No, the suit.
it's fitted with updated comm gear we were set to test today, including a Ham Radio.
it's low-tech, but worth a try. - Stick with procedure.
we still haven't ruled out ISS structural blockage, and we're two minutes away from loss of signal.
copy. Two minutes away from the Zone of Exclusion.
we won't have any comm for ten minutes, which is exactly why...
let us give it one more try from down here.
ev1, this is Capcom. If you read, start making your way back to...
Houston, do you read me?
Hello?
excuse me.
my lucky piece!
everything okay? - Yeah,
I'm just trying to finish what Jake started. Is he still...?
playing the game?
Yeah.
okay, I'll be back as soon as I can.
we need to have a conversation.
is everything okay?
I know Jake and Mr. Bohm weren't in the museum for large parts of today.
you lied to me, Clea.
I just want you to know that I'm gonna take this to the review board.
we need to figure out what to do with you.
I thought we were going to have a conversation.
excuse me?
I'm just saying, you're not the only one with questions.
when I asked you if there was anyone in room six, you said no.
were you lying to me, Sheri?
idiot! Watch where you're going!
your Italian is as trashy as you are.
you are an idiot!
sorry. I didn't read you. Say it again.
break. Break. IT1SS hailing any available station.
I repeat. Mayday. Mayday.
well, I'll be a son of a...
CQDX, this is the International Space Station. Please respond. Over.
mayday. I repeat, Mayday.
IT1SS hailing any available station.
I repeat, Mayday. Mayday.
break. Break. This is KG2DDD. Over.
KG2DDD. Over. Do you read me?
the vacuum tube!
KG2DDD. Over. Do you read me?
Roger that. This is India Tango One Sierra Sierra-- The International Space Station.
holy crap! I'm talking to space!
kilo Golf Two Triple Delta, you read me?
loud and clear.
Dr. Knox.
do I know you?
no. But I know you.
triple Delta, you copy?
if your coordinates are correct, this should connect me to your guy.
let's do this. Switching over now.
KG2DDD with urgent relay from IT1SS.
do you copy?
do you copy?
come on, buddy, you got to hear me!
Yes. This is KG2DDD.
have you five by five. Go ahead.
Yes!
I mean, you need to head to airlock.
IV needs you to terminate for high CO2 levels immediately.
affirm. Wilco. NA1SS returning to station now.
two cans and a string-- of all the things in the suit to work, her ham radio.
I don't know who you are, but I owe you a beer.
you don't owe me a thing.
just tell me this. How do we look from up there?
beautiful.
don't believe we've met. - We haven't.
but I know all about the way you prey on the lives of desperate people for profit.
there must be some mistake. Perhaps you're confusing me with someone else.
no mistake. The taxi driver recognized you.
it's hard to forget the face of the man who stole your child.
I'm sorry, but this-- it's-it's farcical.
I'm merely an obstetrician, nothing more.
now, seeing as you have no proof to back up your slanderous claims, I must be going.
I think I have all the proof I need, starting with the fraudulent adoption documents you're holding, and an eyewitness who's willing to testify that he altered those documents after he received payment from you.
no one has the right to separate a child from a parent they love.
nobody.
hello Tri-Borough drivers, you fine specimens of humanity.
you wouldn't believe me if I told you what happened to me today.
what's that? You want to hear it anyway?
well, you know all of that so-called junk I got up here on my dispatch box?
today, I used it to save the life of an Italian astronaut.
Seriously?
that's incredible.
wait till you hear this story, guys.
if two points are destined to touch...
the universe will find a way to make the connection.
even when all hope seems lost...
certain ties cannot be broken.
they define who we are.
and who we can become.
across space... across time...
along paths we cannot predict...
nature always finds a way.
Hey, buddy.
I want you to know, everything worked out.
Jake, I...
I need you to know that you made a difference.
together we changed things.
do you want me to make the next move?
okay.
what's wrong?
I'm off Jake's case.
we're missing a few seconds of Teller outside of room six.
ten minutes later he was dead.
Sheri, what can you tell me about the patient in room six?
Jake keeps going AWOL and ending up there.
wondering who's inside.
no one. The room's empty.
they say that the shortest path between two points is a straight line.
but what happens if that path gets blocked?
when sediment impedes the flow of a river, it redirects...
zigging and zagging instead of following a straight course.
you but
what looks to the crow like meandering, is to the water the most efficient route from source to outlet.
nature finds a detour.
sir! Sir, sir, excuse me.
I think you dropped something.
ham radio has what, three working parts?
I told them the tube was loose but nobody listens.
Thanks, though. - You're welcome.
when two points are destined to touch but a direct connection is impossible...
the universe will always find another way.
would you mind watching Jake. I forgot his... hat.
come on, guys. Let's light a fire.
are you okay?
Yeah, about a year ago I took Jake to the Science Museum.
I spent the better part of three hours trying to talk him out of a stall in the men's room.
I'm just not sure about today.
for you to even have a dog in the custody fight against your sister-in-law,
Jake's gonna need to show progress.
right now he lives in a world of his own making.
experiences like today push the boundaries, but we don't grow if we stay comfortable.
we're not just talking about Jake now, are we?
Clea, you guys coming or what?
okay, buddy. You ready?
it's time to get going.
what is it?
the pattern.
the company your sister-in-law works for.
aster Corps. It's the same symbol.
it can't be a coincidence that Jake keeps landing on a triangle.
okay, buddy, stay where I can see you.
good, all seven present and accounted for.
that's right, we're one down.
I keep forgetting room six is still empty.
who did you say was in there last?
I didn't.
Jake, stop!
I'm so sorry. My son, he runs away from me.
not to worry. I remember when mine was that age.
enjoy the museum. - Thank you.
check it out. She's waving at that boy. She can see him.
I read about this, it's a live shot of Paris.
this isn't my phone. 555-0101?
Hello?
I'm sorry. Look, I think I have a pretty good idea how this happened.
my son must have picked it up.
we're in the first exhibit hall. We'll wait for you here.
you're welcome.
what are the chances you had something to do with that?
Oh, my God.
Jake, it's all right, buddy.
we'll just go look at something else. I spy something red.
I'll get her back. - Okay.
just calm down. Jake, Okay, it's gonna be all right.
Jake... - Yeah, I can see you. Can you see me?
Jake, I'll take care of this.
I'm sorry to bother you, but could you ask your friend to grab the lady with the red coat?
please, it's important.
he needs to speak to the woman in the red coat.
see, buddy, look, someone's going to get her.
Jake, please...
see, buddy? She came back.
Jake, I don't know what you want me to do right now.
here she is.
Hello? I'm sorry... I don't speak French.
I do.
excuse me. I think you have my phone.
I'm so sorry, my son has a thing for cell phones.
that's okay. - Thank you.
excuse me...
by any chance is your name... Simrin?
Yes. I'm sorry, do I know you?
no, but I think she does.
I'm sorry. This can't be happening. I'm so sorry.
no. No.
what the hell just happened?
she says... she thinks that was her mother.
but her mother died 21 years ago.
Veronique's birth mother died when she was an infant.
all she got was one picture and her mother's name.
sounds pretty far-fetched. It's been more than 20 years.
I told you before, these numbers, patterns, they're not just coincidence.
are i know
she says... Simrin isn't a common Indian name.
the birthmark on her cheek. She's the right age.
damn it.
I want to follow the road map, I do.
but there isn't a number this time and I don't understand what the triangles mean.
and today's a really important day for us, too.
I-I just can't leave.
maybe Clea's right. I mean, we can't be certain that this is her mother.
I mean, it's been 20 years.
it's her mother.
how can you be sure? - I just am.
you look after Jake. Tell her I'm gonna try and find her.
hello Tri-Borough drivers, you fine specimens of humanity.
that's right, Sal Slaykoff is back from breakfast...
and it was delicious. Thanks for asking.
funny thing happened to me on my way back from Diego's Chicken and Waffle House.
total stranger took a moment out of his busy day to do me a solid.
found something I'd lost.
we're all moving forward in this big, crazy world.
each of us in our own little box.
wouldn't kill you to make a bit of human contact.
keep that in mind next time you pick up a fare.
anybody copy?
what am I talking to myself here?
growing tell what that no my he
Veronique... my God, what?
he he deserves no after to i
finding her alive would change everything.
I spent that on the try and smart
Hey, Ipolita.
the suit with your comm gear is taking the next space walk.
Gratzi, Allegra.
look if you stop what you are who i it is the expert dont a few you you are my ready?
ready.
damn it.
Jake. What the hell are you doing?
this running off has to stop. It is not safe.
I tried to find her, okay?
I couldn't; I'm sorry.
we need to go back inside before they notice that we're gone, okay?
come on. Now.
tell me Jake's with you.
Yeah, I've got him.
we're on our way back.
sweetheart, what is it? - Is he all right?
Yes, thank you; he's fine.
you free?
jackass.
you'll make two stops before dropping me off at JFK.
I have a 10-2 at 35th and Ninth.
copy, that's your last fare of the day.
Jake, I don't know what you want me to do.
I tried to find her, but I couldn't.
you know what? I've got an idea.
Clea. - Hey, it's me.
the mother, Simrin, her cell phone...
when it rang, do you remember what I said the incoming call was?
it-it started with 555.
I think it was 0101?
I think that's it. 555-0101.
Yeah, I think that's what it was.
look, I want to try something. We're gonna be a minute; okay, thanks.
hotel Trio, how may I help you?
come on, buddy.
excuse me, I'm looking for a woman. She called me earlier from the hotel.
Hey, little man. Are you lost?
I'm sorry, it's my son. I'll take care of it.
nice job on the SARJ inspection.
install your camera, and we'll move on.
what? No smoke break?
you want to wrap this up in under six hours,
I suggest you head to S1 zenith for the RPCM swap.
Roger that.
give me a glove check.
pristine.
good,'cause one cut could really put a damper on your day.
says the woman sitting inside.
translating.
can you verify the HUD compares well with the DCM?
okay, I know men aren't known for their multitasking abilities, but I really need a check on your suit's data. How do you read?
Gio, do you read me?
Gio, do you read me?
um, sorry, is there something I can help you with, sir?
Veronique, right? - I'm sorry, my name is Nandu.
how is that possible? I just saw you...
are you a guest in this hotel? - No, no, no, please just hear me out.
I think I met your sister, your twin sister.
I'm sorry, I'm an only child.
look, I'll just call the front desk.
wait, do you have any family in France? Paris?
no, I was born in India and I moved here before I was one.
please, just call your mother.
her name's Simrin, right?
how do you know my mother's name?
she lost her cell phone, I found it. She called me from this hotel.
I know this sounds crazy, but I think I'm supposed to reunite you and your sister.
I told you, I-I don't have a sister.
what if I can prove to you that you do?
dont
there you are.
Where's Jake and Mr. Bohm?
uh, checking out an exhibit upstairs.
well, we're taking off in 20.
don't want to be late for the surprise back at the Board & Care.
the exhibit, the video wall, it's sponsored by the same group that donated the Beta-tablets to Board & Care, Aster Corps.
is it?
I hadn't noticed.
where are you? We're leaving in 20 minutes.
I know, I know, look, I need you to call Veronique.
I have her on the other line. - Okay, good.
I want you to ask her where she was born; the more specific, the better.
okay, give me one second.
in a town called Akaltara. - Okay, thanks.
you said you left India before you were one?
were you born in a town called Akaltara?
it's just got to be a coincidence.
ask Veronique what her birth date is.
may 1, 1991.
that's your birthday, isn't it? You share the same birthday; you're from the same town.
there are coincidences, and there are truths.
for some reason, I was meant to connect you and your sister today.
please, just let me take you to her.
sometimes twins share allergies.
ask Veronique if she's allergic to something.
you're scaring me. - Don't leave, ple...
she's allergic to strawberries.
damn it.
we're on our way back.
Jake, we need to go back to the museum, or I'm gonna be in really big trouble.
I apologize again for having to meet on the fly, as they say, but, um, I wouldn't want to miss my flight.
no, of course not.
you're a miracle worker, Dr. Knox.
Oh, well, there's a great deal of suffering in the world, but if I can help to ease even one person's pain, well, then I've served a greater purpose.
when we spoke on the phone...
Oh, right. Of course.
by this time next week, you will be a different woman.
Hey, 5:30 a. m.
shift, la, la, la. That's the fat lady singing.
you're shift's up; time to bring those rides home.
hang up your keys, take a shower, hit the bodega on the way home and buy some flowers for the wife.
fly free, little birds.
I'm stuck here in this cage.
let me live vicariously through you.
nobody listens.
tell her I'm sorry.
but the phone number? Didn't you reach Simrin?
it's complicated.
I'm allergic to strawberries.
is it possible that we have met?
maybe I've driven you before.
doubtful.
I avoid this city like the plague.
I'm here on business for the day, that's all.
what is it you do?
obstetrician.
work can be difficult when you're away from the family.
for every man shall bear his own burden.
that's what I used to tell my little one.
although she is not so little anymore.
Yeah, I'll tell you what, why don't you just focus on the road so I don't have to pretend to be interested in anything you have to say.
I lied to Sheri.
after Jake slipped out, she asked where you are.
come on, troops. Drop your stuff and meet up at the rec room.
we got a surprise for you.
did she buy it? - Yeah.
but for the rest of the day, she needs to see you here.
Jake's evaluation hearing is just around the corner.
I know, I know. No more meltdowns.
seeing... Veronique and Nandu together today, it was...
the way it should be. I know.
I... better go help Sheri. - Okay. We'll be right in.
come on, buddy, it's our turn.
thank you.
what am I missing?
Jake, the triangles. I know. We did that.
they were the triangle, and we brought them together.
isn't that what you wanted me to do?
Jake... Jake, just calm down.
I just don't know if I can do this.
it's a fait accompli.
I-if anyone ever found out...
and how would they do that?
I mean, there's no ties binding you to me, me to her, us to them.
why do you think I had you meet me here?
like I said... no ties.
we're playing with people's lives.
well, you should've considered that before you cashed the check.
1604, this is dispatch. Your shift ended 20 minutes ago.
service is waiting on your vehicle.
listen... you're right not to be taking the situation lightly.
we're not God, but...
have no doubt that we are helping people.
you... are helping people.
pull over.
my esteemed colleague will be getting out here.
then you can take me to JFK, International Departures.
CAPCOM comm check. Gio, do you read?
he's too focused on the task.
Allegra, do you have visual? - Negative.
it's possible Gio translated into an area where structures are blocking your signals.
readjustment already in process.
go ahead and keep your scheduled rendezvous.
are you kidding me?
I think the current situation warrants I cancel and continue to try and...
we'll assume I. V.from the ground.
take another stab at reestablishing comm.
Roger that.
we're about to join a Webcast being streamed to schools and libraries all across the country.
now, seeing that we spent the day at the museum exploring space,
I figured why not bring a little space home with us.
we good to go?
Hello, Earth.
greetings from the International Space Station.
my name is Allegra, and my partner Gio and I have spent the past two and a half months up here working on a range of space observation studies.
we also do housekeeping.
and that's where Gio is right now, actually.
he's outside, fixing a piece of the ISS-- that's kind of like a circuit breaker.
I know that he would love to talk to you himself, but unfortunately, communication is down temporarily.
comm blackouts are normal.
as a matter of fact, once every orbit, the ISS loses all contact with Earth as we pass through the Zone of Exclusion.
it's kind of like when you wear earbuds to tune out your parents.
okay, today's topic is radio communication.
currently, I am orbiting 400 kilometers above Earth, while simultaneously talking to a capsule communicator in Houston and our Webcast server in New York
three distinct, individual points, connected.
these two... by 5, 191 miles.
we call it "triangulation.
in this case, an isosceles triangle where two sides are identical.
that's because right now, at this very moment, the distance between the ISS and Houston - and the ISS in New York is exactly the same. - 5191
what? - May 1, 1991.
that's Veronique and Nandu's birthday, Who can figure out, remember?
.based on my two equidistant sides, what the missing piece of my triangle is?
the top angle is 18 degrees.
cat's cradle and the triangles are what brought us here, but the number that she's talking about, that's what Jake wants me to know, that's why he was still playing the game.
did anybody get that?
what does it mean? - I don't know yet.
the only people that do are part of the triangle.
I need to talk to Veronique or Nandu. I need to go.
but... Sheri, she's watching.
you want to see another meltdown?
I don't have a choice.
I'm gonna have to cut our chat short, kids.
I hope that someday I'm down there talking with one of you up here.
Ciao.
Houston, are you getting this?
extravehicular One's reading elevated for CO2.
we have to purge his suit immediately or he'll enter hypercapnia.
please tell me you've regained comm.
negative. Comm is still down.
I need to know if the number 1604 means anything to you or your sister.
how did you...
Yeah, my father, he's a taxi driver. It's his medallion number.
I'm gonna need to speak with your father, please. It's important.
I was reduced to some pathetic hand-holding, but the transaction's complete.
I'm off to Korea right now to shore up the third package.
problem?
please. These people are desperate.
what part of JFK did you fail to grasp?
I know who you are.
and I know what you're doing.
I'll call you back.
Ah, yes.
every so often I run into one of you people.
so you do, eh?
you do remember me?
no.
but, then, I'm terrible with faces.
I won't let what happened to my family happen again.
I'm taking you to the police.
we can't put spilled milk back in its bottle, brother.
you are a leech... feeding off people's desperation.
it's wrong!
you made me give up my child.
I furnish a service, nothing more.
I'm simply a conduit, providing people with the...happy lives they deserve.
now, the best thing for all concerned would be for you to finish your fare and then go about your life.
my life?
you took my life from me.
every action has its consequence.
No!
how can I possibly face her?
it's too late.
20 years of a lie.
how could she ever forgive me?
I can't promise you that she will.
but your daughters are reunited, and there's nothing that you can change about the past, but the future...that's an entirely different story.
it's a beautiful name.
Yeah.
how did this happen?
we were just 18 when Simrin discovered she was pregnant.
we couldn't look after ourselves, let alone a child.
we hitch-hiked to a free clinic when she went into labor.
an hour later, we had Nandu.
pink and healthy.
wait, you didn't know there were twins?
not until the doctor told Simrin to get ready to push again.
we could scarcely provide food and shelter for one child, but two?
he said... he could give our baby a better life, and with the money he could give us we could move far away, start over.
he wouldn't even let us hold our baby.
so we packed our bags and we moved to New York.
the secret we carried, it tore us apart.
he took our daughter for profit.
and now he's doing it again.
what do you mean?
I didn't recognize him at first, but with each stop we made, everybody he spoke to, the plans he was making for today, I realized...
the doctor who sold Veronique on the black market, he was sitting in the back of my taxi today.
he was mapping the sale of another child, like he was making a grocery run.
you're absolutely positive?
you're certain that that was the same man? - Yes.
I thought I could... stop him from destroying another family.
but I failed my daughters all over again today.
where did you drop him off?
we didn't make it that far, but he was going to JFK.
I need to know every stop you made with this man.
EV1's metabolic rate is rising.
we'll have to get him to airlock and terminate for high CO2 levels or...
ev's are trained to recognize the symptoms of euphoria.
he could make his way back under his own steam.
you don't know Gio.
Ipolita. No, the suit.
it's fitted with updated comm gear we were set to test today, including a Ham Radio.
it's low-tech, but worth a try. - Stick with procedure.
we still haven't ruled out ISS structural blockage, and we're two minutes away from loss of signal.
copy. Two minutes away from the Zone of Exclusion.
we won't have any comm for ten minutes, which is exactly why...
let us give it one more try from down here.
ev1, this is Capcom. If you read, start making your way back to...
Houston, do you read me?
Hello?
excuse me.
my lucky piece!
everything okay? - Yeah,
I'm just trying to finish what Jake started. Is he still...?
playing the game?
Yeah.
okay, I'll be back as soon as I can.
we need to have a conversation.
is everything okay?
I know Jake and Mr. Bohm weren't in the museum for large parts of today.
you lied to me, Clea.
I just want you to know that I'm gonna take this to the review board.
we need to figure out what to do with you.
I thought we were going to have a conversation.
excuse me?
I'm just saying, you're not the only one with questions.
when I asked you if there was anyone in room six, you said no.
were you lying to me, Sheri?
idiot! Watch where you're going!
your Italian is as trashy as you are.
you are an idiot!
sorry. I didn't read you. Say it again.
break. Break. IT1SS hailing any available station.
I repeat. Mayday. Mayday.
well, I'll be a son of a...
CQDX, this is the International Space Station. Please respond. Over.
mayday. I repeat, Mayday.
IT1SS hailing any available station.
I repeat, Mayday. Mayday.
break. Break. This is KG2DDD. Over.
KG2DDD. Over. Do you read me?
the vacuum tube!
KG2DDD. Over. Do you read me?
Roger that. This is India Tango One Sierra Sierra-- The International Space Station.
holy crap! I'm talking to space!
kilo Golf Two Triple Delta, you read me?
loud and clear.
Dr. Knox.
do I know you?
no. But I know you.
triple Delta, you copy?
if your coordinates are correct, this should connect me to your guy.
let's do this. Switching over now.
KG2DDD with urgent relay from IT1SS.
do you copy?
do you copy?
come on, buddy, you got to hear me!
Yes. This is KG2DDD.
have you five by five. Go ahead.
Yes!
I mean, you need to head to airlock.
IV needs you to terminate for high CO2 levels immediately.
affirm. Wilco. NA1SS returning to station now.
two cans and a string-- of all the things in the suit to work, her ham radio.
I don't know who you are, but I owe you a beer.
you don't owe me a thing.
just tell me this. How do we look from up there?
beautiful.
don't believe we've met. - We haven't.
but I know all about the way you prey on the lives of desperate people for profit.
there must be some mistake. Perhaps you're confusing me with someone else.
no mistake. The taxi driver recognized you.
it's hard to forget the face of the man who stole your child.
I'm sorry, but this-- it's-it's farcical.
I'm merely an obstetrician, nothing more.
now, seeing as you have no proof to back up your slanderous claims, I must be going.
I think I have all the proof I need, starting with the fraudulent adoption documents you're holding, and an eyewitness who's willing to testify that he altered those documents after he received payment from you.
no one has the right to separate a child from a parent they love.
nobody.
hello Tri-Borough drivers, you fine specimens of humanity.
you wouldn't believe me if I told you what happened to me today.
what's that? You want to hear it anyway?
well, you know all of that so-called junk I got up here on my dispatch box?
today, I used it to save the life of an Italian astronaut.
Seriously?
that's incredible.
wait till you hear this story, guys.
if two points are destined to touch...
the universe will find a way to make the connection.
even when all hope seems lost...
certain ties cannot be broken.
they define who we are.
and who we can become.
across space... across time...
along paths we cannot predict...
nature always finds a way.
Hey, buddy.
I want you to know, everything worked out.
Jake, I...
I need you to know that you made a difference.
together we changed things.
do you want me to make the next move?
okay.
what's wrong?
I'm off Jake's case.
Hello?
what do you mean, today?
well, why does it have to be today?
when do I get to see him?
Yeah, wh... Hello? Hello...?
there are 31, 530, 000 seconds in a year.
1, 000 milliseconds in a second.
a million microseconds.
a billion nanoseconds.
and the one constant, connecting nanoseconds to years, is change.
the universe. From atom to galaxy, is in a perpetual state of flux.
but we humans don't like change.
we fight it. It scares us.
so we create the illusion of stasis.
we want to believe in a world at rest, the world of right now.
yet our great paradox remains the same...
the moment we grasp the "now..."
that "now" is gone.
we cling to snapshots.
Hello?
but life is moving pictures.
excuse me...
each nanosecond different from the last.
are you Jimar Becko?
time forces us to grow.
to adapt.
because every time we blink our eyes...
the world shifts beneath our feet.
it's time.
I know it's hard. Some you just get really attached to.
he's a pretty special kid.
they all are.
have you told Mr. Bohm?
we spoke a few minutes ago.
how'd he take it?
I realize you two have grown close.
I know this strained your relationship, Clea...
I did what's best for Jake.
I forgot that was even under there.
I made some calls.
I found a great lawyer. She specializes in family law.
it's too late for that.
come on. It's never too late.
look, you lost custody, but there's steps we can take.
they're moving him. - What? When?
today. They just called.
they're transferring him to a long-term care facility - 50 miles upstate.
wait a minute. They can do that?
they have custody of him now. They can do whatever they want.
well, let me call the lawyer. We can stop this.
no.
Martin, it's our best chance. - I'm not waiting another day.
I should never have let them take him in the first place.
I let him down when he needed me the most.
the first night when Jake was gone was one of the worst nights in my life.
I should have just gone and gotten him then.
Martin... - This entire process is a big lie.
stay calm. Be patient...
okay, let's think this through.
this isn't the first time this has happened.
teller was working with a girl who was just like Jake. Her name was Amelia.
when they wanted her, they faked her death and made her disappear.
I'm not letting that happen to my son.
what are you going to do?
whatever it takes.
that's right, 1917 Henley & Hagan, solid brass sextant...
shipped it yesterday.
should be getting there anytime.
I need to buy a gun.
what kind of gun are you looking for? - Anything you can sell me.
do you even know how to handle a gun?
I don't plan on using it.
prison's filled with guys ho said the same thing.
you don't unders...
look, today, I just need people do what I tell them, okay?
you sure you want to do this? - Arnie, are you going to sell me the gun or not?
300 even.
okay. I'll take it.
one... two... three...
okay. Thank you.
you were my friend when I needed one.
you saved my life.
today, let me be your friend.
whatever this is about, don't do it.
I don't have a choice.
you forgot the bullets.
Mr. Becko, I've come all the way from America to do this.
I told you I'm not interested. I don't play anymore.
but you're Jimar Becko.
you're one half of the Becko Brothers, the voice of Jamaican peace and freedom.
I don't sing. I don't play.
not since me brother gone.
and I'm here to change that.
it's Frank. Leave a message
Hey, it's me.
I know you asked me not to call, but I-I just need to know that the man who called about Amelia, did he leave a number to reach him?
she's not dead, Frank. I know you don't believe me.
but I know in my heart it's true.
so please, please call me if you have the information, all right?
Thanks.
got ya all packed up. Big day, huh?
a lot is going to change now, Jake.
and change can be difficult.
I hope you understand we're only doing what we believe is best for you.
having you here, getting to know you...
it's meant so much to me.
I hope that somewhere inside you can feel that...
how much I've come to care for you.
you want some popcorn?
maybe you can write me a message like you did once before, remember?
I guess not.
Mr. Bohm?!
well... that's about it. Looks like we're done.
couldn't we fix up these pews too?
I mean, sometimes these mortise and tenon joints get wobbly.
what do you know from mortise and tenon?
lots.
back in the age of the sail, you had to be able to fix your own mast at sea.
like, if a cannonball hit it or something.
makes sense.
Hey, there you are. - Morning, Gwen.
Oh, sorry. It's bad enough he's here every day after school, but now I can't stop him from running over here right after he brushes his teeth in the morning.
I don't mind. He's been a great help.
is that for me?
I don't know.
did you order a 1917 Henley & Hagan sextant from some pawn shop in New York?
cool.
I've got to go see what latitude we're at.
okay. But don't look at the sun, okay?
okay, Mom.
he's a great kid. - Yeah.
he told me at breakfast that he invited you to dinner tonight.
just so you know, he didn't ask me.
Oh, if it's a problem...
no, no, it's not a problem, but please don't feel obligated.
the thing is, Colin has really taken to you.
and you have to understand that he was only four when his dad left.
so he tends to cling to people who are kind to him. Especially men.
my point is...
I didn't want to get his hopes up about dinner because I didn't know if you were staying in town much longer, now that the church is done.
I-I-I guess it is done, isn't it?
Yeah.
to be honest, Gwen...
I don't know what comes next.
I guess I'm waiting for the next sign.
well, you are more than welcome to join us tonight, if you like.
I mean, nothing fancy. Just turkey burgers and Brussels sprouts.
but, uh, please don't feel obligated if you have anything else...
I like Brussels sprouts. - Great.
a lot.
that's great. Then I guess we'll see you tonight.
well, Mr. Bohm, it's best that your good-bye's kept short.
let him know that you love him, and that you'll see him soon.
I don't need advice from you on how to say goodbye to my son.
the visit will be brief and supervised, as is protocol for a non-custodial parent.
his things are all packed. He's waiting inside the rec room now.
Thanks, Clea.
Mr. Bohm
Hey, buddy.
that's not Jake.
I don't understand. Where is he?
check his room. Check the exits.
what's going on? Where is my son?
we'll find him.
he was sitting right there when I came out to get you.
Mr. Bohm, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
are you kidding? You lost him.
I am sure he's somewhere inside the building.
make sure he finds his way out.
this is outrageous.
Clea, now.
Mr. Bohm, come with me.
I put Jake in a cab and gave the driver your address.
don't worry. I called your building.
the doorman's gonna make sure he gets into your apartment.
Clea, I don't know what to say.
go. He's waiting. - Thank you.
I'm gonna check the downstairs exit. He's unlocked that door before.
you and I need to talk.
Oh, no.
no.
what the...?
what?
Hey, that's mine.
you see them, too. The numbers?
I know you can't see me. I'm the invisible prince.
it's all right. Nobody can.
I write numbers, too. See?
guards of the empire.
they're looking for you?
say no more.
here.
take this letter of transport.
it will assure your safe passage.
I'll distract the guards, and you cross the threshold.
okay? First I must become visible.
Yeah. I'm ready.
safe travels, good sir.
safe travels.
officers. Officers.
uh, uh, I seek 34th street.
now, I'm told it lies yonder, you know, between 33rd and 35th.
I think this thoroughfare here might be the wisest route.
damn it!
I assume you're kicking the door 'cause nothing else worked?
mechanic wanted 500 bucks to fix it.
I told him if I couldn't get it started...
he could keep it.
got to keep moving. I'm looking for someone.
Yeah, who's that?
this Jamaican guy. He's a musician.
heard he was in Portland. And in Portland they told me San Luis Obispo. So...
what about you? Where you headed?
not sure.
I'm looking for someone, too.
no. No offense, but I've seen one too many horror films about women picking up hitchhikers.
sorry.
I totally get it.
sweet. - What?
I just posted some raw footage of this project... I've been working on...
Yeah.
Baaba Maal singing "Three Little Birds" in Mali, West Africa.
nice.
I just posted an hour ago, I already got 318 hits.
Yeah.
Why?
nothing.
just that that was a very important number to my daughter, is all. 318
San Luis Obispo.
Seriously? - Seriously.
if your stuff fits in the back. - It will.
okay, so, I'll start with the altitude.
give me some numbers. Any numbers.
what? Like one to ten?
no. Like 87 and... 31
so 87 degrees...
locked.
now I'm dialing 31 minutes in the micrometer.
how many seconds do you want to add on to that?
eleven. Okay.
so to get the azimuth, I need three more numbers.
those are my numbers.
show me how that thing works.
it's for navigation.
for getting from point A to point B.
from this position I can look up at something in the sky and find out where we are.
how do you find where you're going?
are you okay?
these numbers on the blueprint...
those are my numbers.
the ones I won the lottery with. - Really?
every time I've seen these numbers. They meant something important.
so if you're saying putting these numbers in your sexton can point to a place somewhere on a map...
I'd really like to know where that place is.
I saw the message you left me, buddy.
you mom's birthday.
you wanted to say good-bye to your mom.
pretty good idea.
Abigail? - Martin, what the hell have you done?
what do you mean? - The police were just here.
people from Aster Corps have been calling, people I've never even heard of.
they've put out an Amber Alert for child abduction.
I didn't abduct anybody. Jake ran away. I just found him.
and as far as anybody else should be concerned, I'm still looking for him.
it should buy me a little time. Right now I just need-to get Jake out of the state.
how? You can't even take a train. You can't buy a plane ticket.
you can't even drive your own car.
I don't know, but we'll figure it out.
Martin, I don't think we should talk again. - Okay, I understand.
I'll try and get in touch with you as soon as we settle.
Jake. Jake, we need to go.
I got to figure a way for us to get out of here, but we need to go now.
come on.
let's go.
you really expect me to believe you had nothing to do with this?
Jake escaped. He's done it before.
if you know where they are, Clea, you are aiding and abetting.
you can go to jail for a long time. - I could go to jail?
you look scared, Sheri.
whoever it is you're working for must be very unhappy about all this.
I want you out of here now. - I was just on my way.
you're a criminal, Sheri.
I know you're working for Aster Corps.
I know you had Amelia hidden in room six.
and I know that Arthur Teller's death wasn't an accident.
I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about.
then I guess you got nothing to worry about.
Thanks.
you okay?
fine. Fantastic.
my hus... uh, ex-husband sold our house today, so...
and that's a bad thing?
no. We agreed to sell it and split the money.
it just feels pretty permanent.
my daughter Amelia was born in that house.
we did the whole touchy-feely thing, right?
the midwife and the candles and the music, and...
there I was the whole time swearing like a sailor on crack or something.
and then, uh, last few years,
I, uh, was kind of coming and going.
I'd stay a few months, and try to work it out with Frank.
and then, I'd discover some new breadcrumb, or some clue about my daughter, or...
anyway... Frank could always tell.
he could see that look in my eye.
and then, I'd be gone the next day.
you know, the whole nuclear family thing?
it's overrated.
stand in one place too long, you grow moss on your feet.
good point.
thank you. Thank God that's, uh, not a trap I have to worry about anymore, right?
I'm sorry to ask this of you, but I need your help.
I'm not surprised.
you're a good man, Martin Bohm, but knowing you has a price.
what are you talking about?
everything's gone.
teller's records, his files on Amelia, his entire life's work.
my diamonds--they weren't interested in.
who did this?
Yes, well, they didn't leave a card.
I unlocked the door--this.
so, what do you need?
we have to get out of town unseen.
farther away, the better.
didn't know you had a car.
just bought it.
nice color.
I didn't even notice.
uh, you do realize that the invite was for dinner, not lunch, right?
Yeah.
I mean, now that you're here, I could throw together a salad, but Colin's not even home from school yet.
listen, something's come up.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to leave town for a while.
Really? How long is a while?
I don't know, Gwen. I'm sorry.
I came here looking for some answers.
maybe find some peace.
but all I did was fix up a church.
and what's wrong with that?
look around. You know, this is life, Randall. Maybe this is all you get.
I mean, what are you even searching for?
it's hard to explain.
I'm trying to pay back a debt. - To who?
someone who changed everything.
she gave me a message to deliver, and until I do, I...
say good-bye to Colin for me, please.
Yes. Yes, Michael. I'll tell him. Okay.
an associate.
his cousin works at a small bus station about an hour outside of the city.
you'll be safe leaving from there.
where are we going? - Come. I'll explain as we walk.
come on, buddy. We got to go.
come on, buddy.
his name is Zev. He works at the center window of the three.
he'll have two tickets waiting for you to Minneapolis.
when you get there, call this number.
they'll provide you with a place to stay until you get situated.
okay.
Avram, I don't know how to thank you.
what is it? - Listen to me. Be careful.
whoever broke into my room last night knows about this building, knows about you.
keep one eye over your shoulder, yes?
I will. Thanks again. - Yes.
you take care. Come on, buddy. We got to go.
good-bye, Jake.
this is it. - This? Okeydoke.
so you've really done this 50 other times?
well, 48, but yeah, that's the goal.
50 musicians, all in different countries, all singing the same song.
been around the world and back.
I've been working on this for two and half years?
Why?
my dad was a record executive.
spent his life signing great musicians to bad deals.
people just like the Becko Brothers.
they poured their hearts into those records, creating timeless works of art, and...
he just took their money away.
he left me a little bit of cash. Guess I'm just trying to right some of his wrong?
that must seem crazy stupid, huh?
no. No way.
you got to follow those dreams.
you know, there was a time in my life when all I thought about was traveling the country with a camera, photographing trains.
really. There was something about all that steel, and metal-on-metal.
I just wanted to capture it.
didn't quite work out that way, but maybe some day.
I hope you find who you're looking for.
I hope you do, too, Lucy.
can I help you?
I'm looking for Thomas Becko?
I've traveled a long way to see him. This... this is 3287 Alameda, right?
thomas isn't here. He won't be back for three months.
Oh, excuse me, excuse me! I-I sort of hitchhiked here.
is there any way that I could please... use your bathroom?
thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're the best.
come on, buddy. We got to go.
two ticket to Minneapolis, Minnesota.
we got to roll, young man.
I'm sorry. Just give me one sec.
Jake, look, I understand how hard this is leaving Mom, leaving your home, leaving everything, but we cannot stay in New York.
I'm sorry. Just give me one sec.
Jake, we cannot stay here, do you understand? We need to go!
I'm sorry. We have to change our ticket.
it's too bad I missed him.
saw his brother a few weeks ago in Jamaica.
you saw Jimar?
how-how is he?
well, he misses his brother pretty bad.
doesn't understand why Thomas just disappeared on him like that.
musicians are tricky people.
Jimar wants more than anything in the world just to sing with his brother again.
I could see it in his eyes how badly he misses those sweet harmonies, and I can make that happen.
bring those voices together, from halfway across the world.
can you help me do that?
help Jimar sing with his brother again?
it was never about Jimar.
I love my brother.
well, I don't understand.
you're their sister?
I had no choice.
I couldn't be who I really am.
not then, not there.
the whole country knew me as Thomas.
how could I explain it to Jimar, how it felt?
being trapped in your own body.
your brother wants to make music again.
he won't do it without you.
turn right in 100 feet.
your destination is on the right.
you have arrived at your destination.
this is not right.
please enter a new destination.
I don't have another destination.
4370, Los Angeles, California. Lane two.
Jake, come with me now.
check those.
come on.
Jake. Run!
stop. Just stop.
so help me God, I'll kill you.
take it easy, Mr. Bohm.
you're not going to pull that trigger.
you're not the kind of man who shoots people.
please, I can't let you take my son.
the boy is coming with me.
you'll have to kill me first.
look, please, we need your help. - Get in.
go. Go, go.
what the hell happened back there?
it may be too hard to explain.
I never thought I'd run into you guys again.
it's not a coincidence, Randal, trust me.
how do you know my name?
march 18. 3: 18 in the train station.
you were on the phone before we got in the fight.
you were leaving me a message about my wife, Sarah.
I'm Martin Bohm; this is my son, Jake.
my God, you're Martin and Jake.
for ten years I was scared to meet you.
what you'd think of me.
but I knew I had to.
I mean, if not for me, at least for her.
I found her on the 87th floor.
she was in a lot of pain, so...
I had to carry her real slow.
but after a while, I couldn't go any farther.
so, I-I put her down to rest.
then she told me about you and Jake.
she said that's the reason she wasn't scared because she already had everything she ever dreamed of.
ever wanted.
that's why I called you on March 18, to tell you how brave your wife was and how much she loved you both.
it was my job to save her life.
she saved my life.
she would want you to let this go.
maybe for her sake, that's what we're supposed to do.
move on.
when you got in the car, you said you needed help, that you're in some kind of trouble.
there are these people that want to take my son away from me, so we were trying to get to California.
take my car. - No, I couldn't do that.
Martin, you said yourself, this is no coincidence.
you need a car. I'm giving you one.
it's not even registered; there's no plates. It's brand-new. It's yours.
wait.
Thanks.
thank you, Martin.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
I just wanted to make sure that you were okay.
I'm fine. Should I ask where you're headed?
it's probably better that you don't.
I'll try to call as soon as we get settled.
look, I don't know how to thank you for everything that you've done, but...
you can thank me later. Say good-bye to Jake.
I will. Talk to you soon.

more often, it's wrenching and difficult.
but maybe that's a good thing.
because it's change that makes us strong.
keeps us resilient.
happy... Day. - Santa Monica!
it teaches us to evolve.
well, this is it, buddy.
can't go any farther west than this.
still not exactly sure what we're doing here.
what is it?
excuse me? I-Is this yours?
Oh, yes. Thank you so much.
Yeah.
a weather map? - Yeah.
my, uh, son's into numbers.
Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it?
I've never been to this part of the country before.
Yeah.
what brought you out here?
looking for my daughter.
what's your daughter's name?
hold on.
Calvin Norburg and Adeline Danvers flew from New York to Los Angeles just over three weeks ago, the timeline fits.
Calvin Norburg has my daughter.
now, you know how much my son appreciates what you're doing, but I want you to know, I do too.
your mission is to kill the 36.
if you deviate from that plan, you are simply a godless murderer.
No!
there was another kid the teller was working with in New York.
his name was Jake Bohm.
imagine if we had two of them.
the progress would be exponential.
it would probably cut the time in half.
this is my new phone number.
please, don't tell anyone.
you should've seen Jake today.
the whole class thinks he's a stud.
and we've been dating for, like, four hours.
you touch my son, I swear to God I will kill you.
now I want Amelia back.
if anything happens to me or Amelia-- anything
I promise you, Jake will be gone.
what did Calvin say?
what did he tell you?
he didn't show.
human beings are hard-wired to connect.
we are drawn to one another by our own chemistry.
we produce attachment hormones that create intimacy.
we build neural bridges that bond us, brain to brain...
heart to heart.
rain finally stopped.
Yep.
little too late; it kept me awake all night.
maybe this will help.
Thanks.
those bonds, once formed, are not meant to be broken.
look at you; you combed your hair.
I'm glad you don't have school today.
you can go back to bed.
no, he's got a playdate.
a playdate?
Yeah, Soleil's mother called last night, invited him over for his first playdate ever.
great!
Jake can have fun, and we have time to plan.
by the way, we need a plan.
I'll get some waffles for the microwave.
have fun.
I'll get dressed.
buddy, I wasn't laughing at your hair.
I think you look cool.
you know what?
why don't we just go out for breakfast this morning?
you know, I woke up in the middle of the night last night, and I thought she was next to me.
had trouble sleeping, so she would make me lay with her till she fell asleep.
most nights I was so exhausted, I would end up falling asleep in her bed and then wake up in the middle of the night, her foot would be in my stomach, and...
I would just look at her...
sweet face and think, I'm the luckiest person in the world.
I haven't done that for more than 1, 100 days.
1100
I know.
so...
help me.
give me some quarters?
look, uh...
as soon as we drop Jake off, we'll go to BreakWire, we'll start trying to run down a probable address, okay?
you're racking up some serious digits there, little man.
Hey, buddy.
Jake, come on, we need to go, sweetheart.
Hey, it's me.
guess what I'm doing.
watching a certain curly-haired kid and his dad get into a car.
martin and Jake Bohm.
okay, uh...
follow them, find out where they live.
I'm all over it.
father Esteban!
father San Felipo, I just finished my run. It's my day off.
Acutally,
father Reynoso is ill.
would you mind, so much hearing morning confessions?
I'll get cleaned up.
maybe the evening too, because I don't know what's going to happen.
Jake, hold on.
what the hell you doing?
that blue car behind us, it's been following me since we left the restaurant.
okay, so what are we gonna do?
this.
stay here.
don't move.
get down, Jake.
okay, bud?
why are you following me?!
get out of the car.
why are you following me?
you're crazy, man!
who are you working for?!
who do you...
he's fleeing right now.
backup on P-3!
repeat, P-3!
I was right - we were being followed.
we're good - I don't think we were followed.
not the way you were driving.
nice driving, by the way.
you're late.
come on!
Beth Friedman.
Soleil's mom.
I've heard all about you.
thank you so much for having Jake over today.
our pleasure. Those two, they are just a fork and a spoon.
I think the kids want to make cupcakes.
this is my dad, Soleil's grandfather.
hello. - Martin Bishop.
I'm Carl.
these are Jake's parents!
uh, actually, we're...
here's my cell phone number, just in case.
we'll just pick him up later, if that's okay.
don't worry about a thing.
they'll be just fine.
fork and a spoon, those two.
we'll see you in a couple hours.
thank you.
Bye. - Thank you.
Bye-bye.- Bye, Jake.
el nombre del Padre, del Hijo y Espritu Santo.
ave Mara pursima.
how long since your last confession?
too long, Father.
confess before God, my son.
en ingls, por favor.
my Spanish is not so good.
s.
I am on a mission, but each step brings more confusion, more doubt.
I'm hoping the peace of absolution will help me on my path.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I will explain.
but first, swear to me that you are committed to the sacramental seal of confession.
of course.
if you break that seal, you risk excommunication and ultimate separation from God.
that is my vow, yes.
good.
I have committed a mortal sin.
and what sin is that, my son?
murder.
hospital attack in Syria, do we have a confirm?
confirm, Al Jazeera, bingo.
okay, good to go.
run it raw, straight live.
got a lot breaking here.
any chance of a Martin Bishop exclusive byline?
how about a blistering expos on Calvin Norburg that'll lead to a criminal indictment.
keep talking.
we've got proof that he kidnapped Lucy's daughter, Amelia.
why would he do that?
cause he's a freak.
he's running experiments on her like she's a guinea pig.
excuse me?
Trevor, our kids are different, okay?
Jake and Amelia's brains are special.
they're connected to things through numbers, patterns, ratios.
he found her and he took her, and he's doing whatever research on her, mapping her brain.
this sounds insane.
you do realize that, right?
Yes. - Yeah.
what else aren't you telling me?
he knows about Jake.
what?
he knows that I'm his father.
he knows that I'm on the run.
how do you know that?
because he told me.
when?
last night at the gun range.
you said he didn't show.
you lied.
Yes, I lied. I'm sorry.
Yeah, you lied.
he lied.
you lied.
give me a second.
Lucy, Lucy, it's not what you think.
Lucy, stop.
I was protecting my son.
great, glad that's working for you.
me - not so much.
Calvin threatened Jake, okay?
he threatened my son to my face.
do you understand what I'm saying?
here's the thing, Martin.
truth, not truth - it's either one or the other.
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I was scared.
okay, I'm, I am scared.
maybe truth, I don't know.
I, I don't have a handbook for this.
neither do I, but I thought I had a partner.
but I don't think I need one anymore to be honest.
do you really think the day that we met on the pier was a fluke, just blind luck? Because it wasn't.
Jake led me to you because he wants- he wants
hell, he needs me to help you find Amelia, but the best way for us to do that is through Jake, but we have to do it in his time, on his schedule.
but if you really want to do this, I'm all in.
I will help you find Calvin Norburg and we will get Amelia back.
I promise, no more lying.
okay.
okay.
Oh, no.
two tablespoons baking soda, chocolate extract, chocolate squares, chocolate chips.
you like chocolate?
do now.
smells delicious.
Hi, Grandpa.
taste test.
Ooh, that's for me, oh, yes, it's... - No, no, stop, stop it.
Oh, no, no...
I knew you'd find me.
okay, I'll be there.
were you just talking to someone?
no, I-I was just...
what, what-what's wrong?
my stomach - my stomach feels like it's burning.
all right, you're gonna be okay. Here.
it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.
just drink some water.
Hey, are you okay?
you remember your name?
adeline what?
good. It's just like we talked about.
don't offer any information, no address, no other names.
Yeah, right here.
uh, she's sick.
I'm worried it might be her appendix.
obvious tenderness.
we'll get this checked right away.
now, what about that limp of yours?
Oh, I fell, it's nothing.
Julie, run a CT scan on this girl- possible appendicitis
and I'll take this gentleman to X Ray.
your knee will thank me one day.
Oh, but I'm responsible for her.
you did your job, you brought her to us.
now let us take care of you.
no, but I-I'm not supposed to leave her...
no torn ACLs on my watch.
Hey, Adeline, I'll just be down the hall.
you let me know.
to your left, right there.
I don't understand.
what kind of a mission are you on that involves a mortal sin?
I'm ridding the world of false idols.
false idols?
to return the world to the Creator.
there are 36 souls in this world, Father, placing themselves before God.
they are the ones that must die.
some already have.
by your hand?
Yes.
and there will be more.
you can stop, you must stop, my son.
no, I must not, I cannot.
if you're so certain about your path, why, why come to me?
as a servant of God, I know what I must do.
as a man, it hurts.
I seek the peace and the strength that only God can give.
you want peace, stop what you're doing.
no, I cannot stop until all the 36 are gone and the world is back in his rightful hands.
why this is up to you?
because I'm one of them.
I'm one of the 36.
what do you want from me?
absolution, so I may continue my path.
father, are you there?
absolution comes through forgiveness.
I cannot forgive you, my son.
father, please.
I'm a man of God, the same as you.
you're a killer.
see if you can pull up anything on his family, anything from his past.
I've been running his name on every database in the known webosphere, and I just found something new.
Hmm,"Longtime librarian retires.
two children - William and...
says she's on the board of an exclusive brain injury facility in Beverly Hills
the Greyber Institute-- a private facility specializing in treatment and neuroeducation, made possible through private grant...
ha, look at the name of the grantor.
I'll get the car.
nice.
just keep moving.
to the right.
okay.
try 8877.
how did you...?
this morning - the microwave, Jake.
great.
hold up.
that's her, that's Calvin's mother.
okay, let's do it, let's go confront her.
wait.
just give me a second, I want to try something.
I'll be right back.
beautiful day, huh?
that's why we chose this location - sunshine 300 days a year.
may I ask...
do you have someone in the facility?
m-my wife- she, uh...
I didn't mean to pry.
no, it's, it's all right.
it's, it's actually good to talk about it.
she was in a skiing accident almost a year ago.
how you holding up?
I keep waiting for it to get easier.
Yeah.
my son William
he was in a car accident four years ago.
the car went into the water.
I'm so sorry.
his official diagnosis is "persistent vegetative,
but I don't believe that.
he hears me, I know he does.
I almost lost two sons that day.
you have another son?
I do.
William's older brother was driving the car.
he pulled William out of the water.
unfortunately five minutes had passed, the damage was done.
the irony is, my son does research on the brain.
Really?
since the accident, his focus has changed.
I believe he'll find a breakthrough.
you may have your wife back one day.
it was very nice meeting you.
Oh, no, out of wrappers.
I watch Cupcake Wars, and you do not serve a cupcake without a wrapper.
Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please.
Dr. Forrest, please dial 118.
so what did you find out?
the young man in the wheelchair is Calvin's brother.
Yeah.
he was injured in a car accident.
Calvin was driving.
well, that explains the big donation to this facility.
explains a lot of things.
like Calvin studying other peoples' brains.
he's trying to find a cure for his brother.
let's see.
Yeah.
Mr. Bishop, this is Carl, uh, Soleil's grandfather.
Jake left the house, and apparently has run off.
what do you mean, he ran off?
he and, uh...
and Soleil were in the kitchen making cupcakes.
I was in the other room, next thing I know, he's gone.
I, uh...
I-I'm sorry.
uh, it happened really fast.
I...
I was gonna ring the police...
please don't do that.
I'll be right there.
Jake wandered off from the Friedman house.
I've got to go.
Oh, no.
um, okay.
so, what should I do?
I'll take a cab.
here, take the car.
stay here, see what you can find out.
I'll get back to you as soon as I find Jake.
okay.
what do you mean, she walked out on her own?
you were supposed to watch her every move.
how could you be so stupid?!
I will be right there.
when I looked into his eyes it was like seeing the devil himself.
Padre Esteban.
perhaps this man is suffering a delusion.
he was speaking the truth.
he has killed. And plans to kill again. I know in my soul.
what do I do , Father?
canon Law is very clear on this, Father.
defying the sanctity of the confessional is a crime.
but Father what is worse...
to break the seal or to remain silent and allow others to lose their lives?
if you do what you are telling me you want to do, for you, Father there can be only one result...
excommunication!
Hello?
Yes.
this is...
Linda from the Greyber Institute.
is there a problem?
Nu...uh, no.
uh, quite the contrary.
it's your brother.
there's been a...
breakthrough.
I'll be right there.
I'm sorry. I'm looking for my son.
he's 11 years old, curly hair.
have you...?
no.
Hello, Calvin.
who are you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Amelia's mom.
Hey, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
one shot of this will stop his heart.
you get away from my brother.
Where's my daughter?
I know you have my daughter.
security!
listen to me.
it's only water.
I want my daughter!
this woman just broke in here!
doesn't my foundation pay you people enough?
I don't even want to think about what Calvin's gonna say.
witness saw her get into a cab.
I just got off with the cab company.
dispatch reported a girl matching Amelia's description took a cab ride to the Marina Del Rey Boardwalk.
then that's where we need to be right now.
wait! Wait! Wait!
please, I've made a mistake.
I need to get off the bus now, please.
open the door.
I'm making progress, Will.
I'm getting closer.
one day soon, you're gonna be whooping my ass out on the court again.
all I know is, it's a foundation of-of some kind.
I-I don't know the name, but Calvin supports the facility with it.
there's got to be some public record of it.
I'll see what I can dig up.
Thanks, Trev.
I know it's a long shot, but it's all we have.
all right. I'll call you when I've got something, okay?
they're together.
yeah?
I got the picture you sent.
what's it mean?
it's time.
Jake's leading us to Amelia.
I'm at 8877 Bayside, Marina del Rey.
it's an arcade.
get down here as soon as you can.
okay, 8877. Got it.
how do we know where?
I don't know yet.
just keep looking for the number.
dock 29.
come on.
I got him.
Where's Amelia?
you all right?
Jake, where is she?
Where's Amelia?
Oh, my God.
Jake, don't you move.
No!
No!
No!
No!
it's all right. - Amelia!
come on.
I thought this might help.
look, I know there's nothing I can say to make this better.
but I am truly, truly sorry.
I just wanted to say good night.
you're a very special girl, Amelia.
and you may not know it, but you're going to help a lot of people one day.
you're going to help my son.
I know you miss your mother, but she just wouldn't understand why you're here.
I would like to report a crime.
there are two ahead of you, Father.
I will wait.
are you alright, Father?
perhaps you would like some water?
I'm a bit warm. That's all.
a bathroom down that hall...
there's a drinking fountain.
it's always cold.
gracias.
Hey, buddy.
you all right?
cool.
it's like a fort.
I'm sorry about all the craziness, Jake.
my God, you could fill the Grand Canyon with everything I'm sorry about.
you know, I have this dream every once in a while.
we're in front of a big house, our house.
we're on the lawn playing ball.
you really zing one.
it's high and I have to jump to catch it, but...
I catch it.
and I land on my ass.
and the two of us start laughing.
start laughing like crazy.
together.
we're gonna get Amelia back, Jake.
and I know what you're doing is important, trust me, I know.
but as your father, I have a responsibility to protect you, to...
to make sure that you're safe.
and I'm doing the best I can.
your mother would be so proud of you right now.
the way you've handled all this.
I am, too.
I am, too.
Padre.
father, I am giving you one more chance.
you said your Spanish was not good.
I didn't want anyone to hear my confession.
I'm here for my absolution.
I have none to give.
you have made a choice to deny God.
no man has that right.
Padre nuestro que ess en los cielos...
Hey, Trevor.
Hey, Luce.
I've got a name for Calvin Norburg's foundation-- "Mandlebrot.
and get this, Mandlebrot Incorporated just bought a loft downtown eight days ago.
do you think that's where Calvin's living?
it's a good bet.
give me the address.
our brains, our entire nervous systems, are designed for us to form deep, lasting bonds.
when those connections are broken...
bad things can happen.
I've never been to this part of the country before.
what brought you out here?
looking for my daughter.
my son, Jake, he led me to you to try and help you find your daughter.
No!
I can't do it.
my heart is not in it anymore.
I don't need your heart, just your brain.
that's where the money is.
you've never been on my side, Tony.
Tony Rigby was my best friend.
he took my departure from Aster Corps personally.
guess what I'm doing?
watching a certain curly-haired kid and his dad.
why are you following me? - You're crazy, man.
who are you working for?
I'm making progress, Will.
I'm getting closer.
I did it for my brother.
I don't care about your brother. Where is my daughter?
Amelia's gone. She was here.
I know she was. Where is she?
where did you see my son? Come on, Phillip, stay with me.
I know who did it, and he's after Jake.
the blackest day, the day you were born.
run, Jake!
it's your moment, Jake.
are you ready?
bodies at rest stay at rest, and bodies in motion stay in motion, unless acted on by an outside force.
what exactly was the plan here, huh?
you realize you would have had to run another day and a half to reach civilization?
let's go.
people, like objects, become set in their paths, embedded in a constrained reality.
as we travel our path, the possible futures, which were once infinite, collapse down to one.
one outcome, unchangeable, escapable.
are you okay?
fine.
you said you could handle her.
now, where are the results you promised?
where is this transformative data?
look, the place hasn't been used in a decade.
the power grid is a joke.
I blow a fuse every time i charge my phone.
if this programms is exposed, we could all go to jail.
we have to stay off the radar.
this is the safest place right now.
what did they do to you?
the new generator is on its way.
in the meantime, i need results to take to my boss.
if you can't deliver that, you're of no use to me.
you must have known you weren't gonna make it.
what were you thinking?
look, this is not like working with Calvin.
these people will hurt you.
you don't care about me.
you're just trying to make enough money so you can pay back your bookie.
I was desperate, and I made a deal with the wrong people, but pissing them off isn't gonna help anyone.
the only way that we survive this is by proving our value, okay?
I'm hungry.
I'll get you some breakfast.
we're each on a path, and sometimes those paths become entwined, pulled into each other's orbits, and collide.
please!
save me!
Hey, buddy, everything's gonna be all right, okay?
Martin, I'm so glad you're here.
looks like we may have a problem. - What?
well, I just checked in on Phil, the guy you saved in the basement.
he's so grateful for everything that you did for him, he's given a full statement to the police that contradicts everything I said.
he told them about me.
he gave them yours and Lucy's full names.
what about Jake?
no, he didn't get that far.
he was pretty out of it, but look, it gets worse.
there was a detective in their, clearly a high-ranking guy.
he had access to my database.
obviously knows more about us than we do about him.
well, then Jake and I will disappear.
no, just stay at home. I need to know where to find you.
here's the cop's card.
ring any bells?
I've never heard of him.
okay, well, just do me a favor.
hang on to the card, lay low.
I'll be in touch.
thank you.
Hi, you.
how you feeling?
better.
I could sleep for three days, but besides that... How's he?
not good.
so he said this detective has no idea where to find us, right?
he doesn't have an address or anything?
not yet, but we need to keep it that way.
well, I told him I was staying in a hotel and I fell through a glass table.
I hope that worked.
a glass table? - Yeah.
pretty good.
what?
0175, Jake wrote that down on the window when we were leaving the hospital.
hold on.
I just want to follow him and see where he goes.
he's turning left.
Jake, stay in the car.
Rigby. " I think this is Tony Rigby's house."
what is Calvin doing here?
I thought Calvin and Rigby hated each other.
so did I.
remember me?
Oh, what are you doing here?
I told you to stay away from me.
you also told me that you weren't working with Tony Rigby.
what are you doing here?
Tony Rigby murdered my mother, and he took Amelia.
I would never work with Tony Rigby.
where is he?
I don't know.
that's why I'm here.
he disappeared. I'm looking for him.
he's with Amelia and you're gonna help us find her.
I told you, I don't know where she is.
don't forget I got your files on a hard drive full of information waiting to be handed over to the police.
now where would Aster Corps try to hide Amelia?
where would they try and hide her?
somewhere isolated.
somewhere they can control.
the problem is they have 83 facilities in seven different countries that match that description.
there is a high-level Aster Corps directory.
where would I find that directory?
in my loft.
good. I'll drive with you and Lucy will follow.
the day my mother was killed and Amelia was taken,
Kase, my assistant, he never showed up.
somebody had to have given Rigby access to the front door.
I've been trying to reach Kase, but no luck.
Yeah, well, everybody's got their price.
kase knows how I think.
he knows my work.
he'll have a new lab up and running in no time.
Yeah, but to what end?
I mean, I understand why you would do it, but why would Aster Corps want Amelia?
knowledge is the new currency.
aster Corps wants to harness Amelia's incredible predictive abilities.
I mean, if they can map her neural pathways, they'll be able to predict the movements of their stocks, foresee the outcomes of elections, you name it.
so it's all about money? They abducted a child to increase their profit margins. Is that it?
they don't see her as a child.
they see her as a means to an end.
Where's Jake?
Oh, my God. Jake!
Jake, what have you done?
stop! You can't just rip him out! It's too dangerous!
shut it down. - You can hurt him.
shut it down! - I know it looks scary...
you get him out of there, or so help me God, I'll kill you.
now!
I'm telling you it's a mistake.
before Amelia started working with Teller, she was trapped inside her own mind.
maybe Jake knows this can help him.
Oh, my God.
what? What is it?
what do you see? -These waves here.
wernicke's and Broca's, they're beginning to oscillate.
is that bad? - No, it's just the opposite.
what does it mean?
his speech center.
it's getting ready to fire.
what are you talking about? He doesn't speak.
I found you.
where are we?
I don't know.
ever since I was born, I had this locked door in my mind.
and then, one day, when I was working with Calvin... ...it just opened.
after that, I could come here whenever I wanted.
I could hear you, but I couldn't get through.
what changed?
you see this pattern here?
it indicates both sending and receiving.
what does that mean?
what does that mean?!
he's having a conversation.
with who?
Jake, if you're talking to Amelia, tell her I love her, okay?
tell her I love her.
you mom's here.
she wants you to know that she loves you.
I know.
I can, I can feel her.
tell her, tell her that we're coming for her.
we're coming for you.
I knew she didn't give me up.
ask her where she is, if there's... - ...an address, a landmark?
we're in the desert.
there's a water tower, and the building's old.
I think they used it for other experiments.
there's a sign.
it says "Teller Institute, established 1997."
come on, buddy, please.
the conversation's over. He's coming out.
what's he writing? - "1997." Maybe the year?
1188. I know that number.
part of an address, maybe.
there are no Aster Corps facilities with 1188 in the address.
1888. It was the address to Teller's loft.
the one he shared with Avram in New York City.
so, what, they took her back there?
no, no, no, Avram would have called me.
but obviously this has something to do with Teller.
there was something in Teller's files.
by the time I met him, he was already established in New York.
but before that, there was another lab, years earlier.
here.
in Apple Valley.
he started working there in 1997.
I always thought the Teller Institute was just his house in the Bronx.
that's what it became after Aster Corps discredited him.
so they took Amelia back to where it began.
here's the location.
about two hours southeast of here.
in the middle of nowhere it looks like.
they'll be able to see you coming for miles.
you'll have to approach very carefully.
us? What about you? I thought you wanted revenge.
I need to focus on saving my brother.
he's all I have left.
thanks to Jake, I think I have the final piece of the puzzle.
forward the map to my phone.
come on, buddy. Let's go.
I hope you find her.
I shouldn't even have to be looking for her.
I figured it out, Will. I know what to do.
the kid... Jake... his brain was... amazing.
I never knew where the right pathway was until today.
Mr. Norburg, I thought that was you.
do you need anything?
coffee. Lots of coffee.
okay. Maybe I'll just call Dr. Whitman.
Yeah, go ahead. Call whoever you'd like.
you know what they're gonna say?
Yes, Mr. Norburg, whatever you want, Mr. Norburg.
"thank you for your generous donations, Mr. Norburg. " You work here?
how old are you? - 17. A volunteer.
I want to be a neurosurgeon when I grow up, so I got permission to...
I'm sorry. You don't care.
look, I know this probably looks kind of strange, but I know what I'm doing. There's an implant in my brother's brain right here, you see?
like they do for Parkinson's patients.
very good.
it fires electrical impulses, rerouting the synaptic pathways.
my hope is that I can redirect all of his brain functions around the damaged areas.
so he'll be able to talk and move.
exactly.
it'll be like the accident never happened.
okay, it looks like we got about ten more miles on this road.
hey... what's that?
open it.
it was my mother's. She left it to Amelia.
you look happy.
well, I wasn't always a deranged conspiracy theorist living out of my car.
what did you do before?
you know, it's funny.
after everything that we've been through, I don't know the first thing about you.
well, I guess we know the important stuff, right?
but if you must know, I was in advertising.
I wouldn't have guessed that.
there wasn't a client in the world I couldn't land, believe me.
Yeah, I bet.
cause you were the most determined.
no, no, no, no, no. Please! - What?
the engine's boiling over.
I hate this car.
the pathway's still open.
we're getting there.
motor test.
again.
flexion to pain.
localized response. That's a five on the GCS. He-He's never been more than a two.
okay.
moving on to the brain stem. This is the home stretch.
rapid eye movement, both eyes.
he's looking at me. It's working.
he can hear me.
what... happened?
the garage is closed for the weekend.
how's she doing?
not good. It's gonna take at least an hour to cool down.
we don't have an hour. - I know.
having some trouble?
engine overheated.
I could take you to the next town.
they probably have a mechanic.
we don't have time for that.
actually, we're trying to get there.
is there any chance you could give us a ride?
that's 20 miles off the highway.
it'd probably put me way behind schedule.
hold on.
I got 200 bucks.
Yeah, I can do that. Hop in.
Thanks. I'll get Jake.
watch your step. - Thanks so much, sir.
okay.
Hey, buddy, come on.
why don't we we put that back? It's not ours.
I don't mind.
he's just like my kid, curious about everything.
she, uh, helps out at a hospital near where we live.
wants to be a doctor.
she's beautiful. When I was her age, I wanted to be a beach bum.
Yeah, Evie practically grew up in a hospital.
mom had cancer.
she passed last year.
I'm sorry.
so many memories in that house.
I miss Evie so bad, but every time I'm home...
well, there's some times I feel like I'm abandoning my kid by being away so often.
I'm so sorry.
I know what you mean.
I haven't seen my daughter for three years, and if I had a choice in the matter...
I know, it's just... It's been so long.
what if she won't talk to me?
then you keep trying until she does, I guess.
have arrived in your destination.
Oh, it snuck up on me.
here we are.
wherever here is.
look, I don't feel right leaving you guys out here.
no, we'll be fine.
look, thank you very much for the ride.
I wish you the best with your daughter.
thank you. - Come on, Jake. Let's go.
this is the address.
where is it?
come on.
she's in there?
Yeah, with at least a dozen armed guards.
Calvin was right.
they'll see us coming a half an hour before we even get there.
if we spook them, they'll just take her and run.
okay.
so maybe we wait till nightfall.
Jake, no, no.
no, Jake, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Martin, they're getting the Jeep.
they're gonna be here any minute; we got to go. We got to run.
we can't outrun a Jeep.
they're gonna keep searching till they find someone.
wait.
that's it.
that's what Jake wants; He wants them to find me.
that's my way in.
you stay hidden.
you make sure that Jake's safe.
Hey, it's okay, buddy.
help! - Let's get him.
thank God. I've been wandering around for hours.
sir, you're on private property. - I know.
I'm sorry, my car broke down a few miles back.
I got turned around.
why don't you get inside?
Thanks.
all right, let's go.
all I need is a phone, okay?
I can call a friend; they'll come pick me up.
whatever you guys are doing out here, I promise I won't say a word.
get inside.
you can't be serious. - Now.
fine.
I don't want a problem.
I just want to get out of here.
can I at least get some water?
Hey, please, can I get some water?
I haven't don't anything wrong.
my car broke down!
you can't hold me like this!
how did you find us?
you.
I thought you worked for Calvin.
sort of.
mostly I worked for his mother, t - taking care of Amelia.
where is she? - I can't tell you.
they'll know that I helped you, and they'll kill me.
you'll tell me where she is right now.
please, you don't know what these people are capable of.
right now, you have no idea what I'm capable of.
now, where is she?
she's locked in a room on the other side of the building.
give me the keys.
show me.
I'm so sorry.
mom loved you more than anything.
she was here every day, making sure you were comfortable.
I remember her... aria.
her voice?
she read to you.
right, her voice.
words still jumbled.
Yeah, a certain amount of aphasia, it's normal, you know.
you'll get over it with time.
just be patient with yourself.
what... what was that game that she hated?
the one with the apples?
with the pillows?
Yeah. Y-You would make a big mountain out of cushions and then you would climb to the top, and then you'd push it all over like an avalanche.
and you would come and save me.
do you remember anything about the accident?
Yeah.
it was... a storm, and I was supposed to go on a railing?
no, a... - A flight.
Yeah, you were going back to school in Connecticut.
I had promised that I would get you to the airport on time.
the rain was coming down really hard, and we were listening to the oldies station on the radio.
and then you took a turn. And...
William... I can't tell you how sorry I am about the accident.
it was my fault.
you trusted me, and I...
and you're still moving mountains to save me.
come on, before the guard comes back.
stay with me.
I got to get you somewhere safe.
come on.
we have to find some keys.
here.
got it.
good idea. They can't catch you if they can't drive.
let's go.
Hey, it's okay. We're gonna get your dad, but we need...
wait up.
her room's just around the corner.
hold on, wait, wait.
don't you move.
go.
I know I locked it.
well, I didn't let him out.
where are they?
don't be frightened.
my name is Martin Bohm. I'm a friend of your mother's.
I know who you are. You're Jake's dad.
we have to go. We don't have much time.
I'll follow you.
show me the girl's room.
she's gone.
where are they now?
I don't know, sir. I'm trying, but every... - Just find them.
we're never gonna make it.
shut up.
hold up.
get back here.
is there another way out of here?
there's seven possible exits, but no matter where we go, they'll see where we're going and cut us off.
they have eyes everywhere.
so we're gonna have to blind them.
show me how.
the circuits are ancient.
we can overload the system.
we'll turn the lights on last so no one will know where we are.
okay.
the servers.
you can power them up from that computer over there.
all right.
they're not in the south wing.
circle around east.
they're up.
are you ready?
Yeah.
that's Martin Bishop.
somebody get the power back on!
immediately!
we need to get back to your mom and Jake.
they're not where you left them.
I know where they are.
we're going to need a car.
damn it. Come on.
get down.
I'm in the garage.
we're heading out now. They won't get far.
get to the back, now.
Hey, someone's been in here. The keys are gone.
what do you mean, the keys are gone?
they're gone. They're not there.
come on.
stop here.
I don't see anything.
Amelia, wait! Amelia, get back in the car! - Mom?
mom... - Amelia?
Amelia! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
my baby! My baby!
I'm so sorry I couldn't find you.
my baby. Oh, my... - Lucy!
Lucy, we gotta go now! - Okay.
Jake, get in the car!
three of the teams radioed in.
there's no sign of them.
keep looking.
ms. Farington.
you lost her.
Yep, that's right. The girl's gone.
but we found her once.
I'm sending Tanner.
no, that is really not necessary.
I'm still in complete control of the operation.
we're taking a team out right now.
we're gonna find her.
you leave me no choice. He'll be there in 20.
that should do it.
Thanks.
well, now that we've got Amelia back, we've got all the evidence we need.
the cops can't ignore us.
just got to find the right cops.
so let's do it. What do you want me to do?
I want you to disappear.
Why? - Lucy, Guillermo Ortiz is still out there.
it's dangerous.
it's gonna take some time.
aster Corps is gonna use that time and all of their resources to try and find you and your daughter.
you need to go somewhere that you've never been before.
look, we could never imagine what your daughter's been through.
disappear... somewhere safe.
spend some time with her.
okay.
no.
I'll see you soon enough.
you take care, Lucy. - I will.
you kept it. Thank you.
give this to your dad.
he'll know what to do.
Hey, guys. I'm sorry to interrupt, but, Jake, we gotta go.
Amelia, it's a real pleasure to finally meet you.
come on, buddy.
Bye, you.
I'll see you soon.
Jake, we gotta go.
Lucy... we'll see you soon. - Bye.
let's go.
Mr. Norburg.
Oh, no!
the old pathways must have been too strong.
he regressed!
why didn't you wake me up?!
I-I didn't know what to... - Get out!
we each have a path.
some are forced apart, but flow back together, their synchronicity inescapable.
Evie, honey?
some paths touch only briefly, and glance off in different directions, forever changed by the meeting.
some loop back again and again, across time and space...
mom... - ...always finding each other.
you're gonna have to get used to it, kid.
I'm gonna be hugging you and kissing you and staring at you while you sleep.
I'll be honest, it's gonna be a little creepy.
you're so beautiful.
I know, Mom.
Oh, my God.
aster Corps.
once we're on our path, there are limited chances to deviate, small moments when some other force comes into play, and knocks you off your trajectory.
ms. Farington, we've spotted Lucy Robbins' vehicle.
is Amelia with her?
unclear. How should we proceed?
we only need the girl. The mother's a liability.
get rid of her.
make it clean.
it's okay, honey. I'm not gonna let them take you.
I know.
this car's faster than it looks. Don't worry.
we turn around, they follow, they catch us in three minutes.
you saw that?
I see the paths, the possibilities. - Okay.
so we off-road, and we'll lose 'em in the desert.
the axle breaks down in 23 miles. They catch us in six minutes.
is there any path where we escape?
no.
is there any path where you escape?
Yeah. - But not me.
no... I run, you block them, and they...
okay. It's okay, baby. Okay?
no, I won't leave you.
here's what I need you to do, babe.
I need you to go out to the desert, I need you to run as fast as you can, okay?
whatever happens, wherever I am, I promise I'll be watching you, okay?
I love you. Okay, go!
run.
run as fast as you can, okay?
run!
what could be powerful enough to change your path, change your future?
an act of nature.
an act of love.
Where's the girl?
what girl?
look, I don't know who the hell you are...
I'm her mother.
once this deviation happens, you find yourself on a new path, uncharted, unknown and stretching out ahead of you.
Dr. McCormick.
my name is Avram. This is my friend Jake.
we believe that your life may be in danger.
my mind has begun working too fast.
it made sleep impossible. I went weeks without a single night.
I felt like I was dying.
but at the sleep center... - 500 milligrams of adrenaline, now.
they're helping me.
last night I slept.
a sleep clinic. - The insomnia is getting worse.
the problem's reached a whole other level.
the clinic gets amazing results.
my name is Martin Bohm.
I'm wanted in the state of New York on one count of kidnapping.
and you've come here to turn yourself in?
I came here to clear my name.
I told you not to take Jake out of the house.
you did it anyway. - It's not what you think.
two men came into my house last night and tried to kill me and take my son.
don't you realize how dangerous this is?
what's happening?
this is Avram. Please leave a message.
Avram, it's Martin.
we're back at your house. I'm sorry for yelling.
please, come back so we can talk.
Where's the girl?
No!
Amel-- oh!
there are few things in the world more frightening than the future stretching out ahead of you, unknowable and unseen.
it was a dream, okay?
just a dream.
but sometimes the most frightening future is the one you do know.
the fate you see coming and can't escape.
Hey, guys.
everything all right?
okay.
come on, let's get up.
we got to get breakfast.
this is Avram. Please leave a message.
Avram, it's me again.
look, you have every right to be angry with me, but please just call me back as soon as you get this, okay?
Thanks.
Yeah. - TREVOR: Martin, turns out a vendor at the farmer's market gave a description of a Hasidic man in his 40s being dragged into a van yesterday.
he was abducted?
looks like it.
avram was running down a lead.
a man named Dr. McCormick. He thought he was one of the 36.
Trevor, we need to find this vendor.
I can be there in 20 minutes.
thank you.
chanting.
Hey, buddy.
I'm getting closer.
it took going back to Aster Corps but I'm finally making progress on the sequence.
we're getting so close.
maybe ten digits away.
when it's complete, then it'll all make sense.
all the random synapses and pathways will...
will untangle, and I'll know.
I'll know how to save you.
I have to go.
I love you.
it won't be long.
since Enron, every reputable accounting firm is skittish.
we can't hide a $40 billion loss in one quarter.
and this gets out, our stock'll be worthless by close of bell Thursday.
none of that is going to happen, because Calvin here is going to help us avoid all that.
now, thank you for coming.
everything all right?
you have the updates from the sleep clinic?
Yeah, we got another four digits last night, so the sequence is now 97 numbers long.
how predictive is it?
uh, 40% one day, 70% the next.
we won't really be able to apply it until it's completed.
and when will that be?
when it wraps back around to the beginning, to 318.
then we'll know it's completed. It should be soon.
well, you need to work faster.
you're auditor shopping, huh?
how bad is it?
my friend was here yesterday.
and then he went missing.
do you remember seeing him?
sorry. I haven't seen him.
thank you.
I found the vendor.
she said it took place in the parking lot around 3: 00.
she called the police 'cause she got a license plate, but they never showed up.
my friend at LAPD ran the van's plates... nothing.
how is that possible? - I don't know, maybe the witness got the number wrong.
this isn't adding up. Why would Aster Corps take Avram?
I mean, if they knew about him, why didn't they just follow him back to Jake?
that's who they want. - Martin.
Oh, no.
Hey, buddy, what's wrong?
Jake, what's happening?
and we have lovely new jasmine blend.
Oh, cardamom.
reminds me of Afghanistan.
and a hint of orange blossom.
enjoy.
Jake, what's happening? - They're dying.
what do you mean, they're dying? Who's dying? Avram?
what's happening?
they're leading us to something.
it's Dr. McCormick.
Amelia, wait there.
Dr. McCormick?
Hi, my-my name is Martin Bishop.
a friend of mine was looking for you yesterday, and he came to this market. I was wondering...
I can't talk. - Just look at the photo.
no, I can't, really. - It'll take two seconds. Please.
doc, please, it'll just take a second. - No, I really can't. Please...
doctor.
Oh, my God.
doctor.
doctor. Doctor.
Oh, my God. Trevor, call an ambulance.
help!
guys, I'm sorry you had to see that.
martin Bohm? - Yes.
detective Lange is on his way to speak to you.
fine. I'll be here.
well, this day just keeps getting better.
I don't know how this is gonna play out
I don't want the kids to be here.
okay. - Thanks.
what do you think? Popcorn for lunch?
are you trying to distract us from the fact that we just saw a man die?
that's exactly what I'm trying to do.
come on.
it's okay, buddy.
you can go, I'll be fine.
go with Trevor.
martin Bishop. Hello.
Dr. Plimpton, what are you doing here?
I'm meeting a friend for lunch.
is your friend Dr. McCormick?
Yes. Why?
please come with me.
so, what cartoons do you like?
I don't like cartoons.
I like real things.
okay.
not hungry, then?
five and three.
five and three.
53. Does that mean something, Jake?
I don't know.
I came to L. A. as part of a medical study.
mccormick was one of the first patients.
he took me under his wing, helped me adjust.
listen, I know how difficult this is for you, but I need to know what happened to Dr. McCormick.
did he have a history with seizures?
I don't know.
he was always making notes in that little book about his health, but I never asked why.
the study you both were part of, wh-what was it for?
it's a treatment for a rare form of insomnia.
my mind is not like other people's, it...
I see images.
sometimes just flashes, other times whole sequences.
people. Things happening.
often in the past.
I try, but I can't shut it off.
I don't even know how to begin to explain this, but...this is my friend Avram.
have you seen this man before?
uh... no. Why?
he was kidnapped here yesterday.
he was looking for Dr. McCormick.
Oh, my God.
how many people are part of your study?
seven.
well, six, now that McCormick's gone.
the nest of seven. - Beg your pardon?
Mr. Bohm.
Ex-excuse me for one second.
detective Lange is here to see you now.
okay, just give me one minute.
I thought you said your name was Bishop.
it's not.
listen, I had to use an alias to protect my son... Please. - I think I've heard enough.
Dr. Plimpton.
doctor!
let's go.
Mr. Bohm, why is it, every time I see you, someone has died?
I know it doesn't look good.
no, it doesn't look good; it looks criminal.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Mr. Bohm, I am trying to help you, but you're not helping yourself.
why are you here?
yesterday a friend of mine was abducted from here.
he was trying to find Dr. McCormick, the man who just died.
abducted.
let me guess, by Aster Corps. - Yes, I think so.
you think so.
did you report it to the police?
no. - Why not, Mr. Bohm?
because I didn't think you'd believe me.
that's the first logical thing you've said so far.
what's your friend's name?
avram Hadar. Here, I have his passport.
Mr. Bohm, the best advice I can give you right now is to go home and stay there until I get this whole Aster Corps abduction, whatever else thing all sorted out.
so I can go? - For now.
but I'll be in touch.
thank you.
you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.
right before Guillermo Ortiz killed himself, he said that he had failed because he couldn't find the "nest of seven."
I didn't know what he was talking about, but I think I do.
Dr. Plimpton said that she and McCormick were part of some sleep study.
there were seven patients, all sharing similar characteristics to Jake and Amelia.
maybe that's what Amelia was talking about when she said,"They're dying."
Dr. Plimpton said that McCormick was tracking his health problems in his journal.
when I walked up to him, he was writing in his journal.
he put it in his pocket right before he died.
we need to find that journal now.
come on, guys, let's go.
come on.
we acquired several companies in 2007.
they seemed healthy.
a few problem patches but sound.
then we looked closer and discovered that there were billions of dollars in hidden debt.
CALVIN: So by then it was too late.
the deal was done.
I thought if I could just buy a couple more years...
so we, as they say, kicked the can down the road.
now that road has come to an end.
all these people, their pensions...
their futures.
at 11: 00 on Thursday our company will release its quarterly report, and the world will see a $40 billion loss.
that's why you need the sequence.
I've got one play left.
go all in with what money we have.
it doesn't matter what stock we invest in or what currency we short, we just need a sure thing.
why are you telling me this?
we're the same, you and I.
look, we both have made a terrible mistake.
but we have a chance to make it right.
why haven't you brought in the boy?
you said you were close. - I am. They can't have gone far.
I don't care what you have to do, you get them!
copy. We have another problem.
one of the sleep study patients died.
we cannot have the police showing up at the clinic.
I know. I'll handle it.
how'd the meeting with Farington go?
she wants faster results.
bad timing.
Why?
what are you talking about?
Dr. McCormick died today.
what?
here at the clinic?
no. He was out.
how?
I-I don't know how.
I think he had a history of heart disease in his family.
still, a death in the study
we-we have to investigate.
the procedure is perfectly safe.
we put these people into medical coma and we force their brains through hours of exhaustive testing.
I'm not sure "safe" is the word that I would use.
you might want to get on board with this.
Where's his chart?
I'll handle it.
I can't take the kids into the morgue.
I'll be right back.
excuse me.
my friend was just brought in here
Dr. McCormick.
I-I was there when he died, and in the panic I forgot to grab something-- his-his journal.
it was in his jacket pocket.
this is kind of embarrassing, but...
he was seeing another woman, and he wrote about her.
he made me promise that if anything ever happened,
I would burn it before his wife could see it.
look, I'll tell you what I told the last guy.
we don't release personal effects.
what do you mean,"the last guy"?
apparently, that journal must have been pretty hot, because a guy came in here 20 minutes ago asking for it.
20 minutes ago.
sir! You are not allowed in there!
so we know that everything that's happening is somehow connected to the sleep study.
it must be one of Aster Corps' subsidiaries.
there are 8 sleep studies in Los Angeles.
this one has only been open for three months.
it's plagued me my whole life.
really, I'm at my wits' end.
okay, um...
you mentioned you knew Dr. McCormick?
Yes. We, uh, we seemed to share the same symptoms.
I try to fall asleep, and then my mind gets full of...
numbers and-and patterns, weird connections.
and I can't seem to shut it off. - Interesting.
okay, well, why don't you come with me-- We'll go this way.
come on in.
why don't you grab a seat?
we've developed a test to determine if you're one of the people that we can help.
take your time with it.
press the button on the intercom when you're finished.
will do.
Trevor, what's wrong?
we got to be quick; they've got a camera on me.
they gave me sort of test to identify the 36s.
I can now say quite definitively I am not one of them.
it's a page of symbols and numbers.
some are circled.
take a picture of it and send it to me.
okay, I got it. Hold on.
show me what to do.
Jake circled three and 48.
okay, I don't get the point.
it doesn't matter; Jake does. Just do it.
I asked you for faster results, and you bring me...
what exactly am I looking at?
McCormick's file is full of holes.
there should be patient histories, follow-ups-- There's none of that.
did you ask Linus about it? - Yes.
I think he's hiding something. I mean I think he's hurting these people.
well, he's getting results.
Yeah, but at-at what cost?
at what cost?
do you have any idea what will happen if Aster Corps fails?
we're talking about gross medical misconduct here.
you kidnapped a child and held her for three years.
Yes, and I regret that every single day.
but even at my worst, I made sure she was safe.
I took care of her. - Do you have any idea how close we are?
with the sequence, we can create an algorithm that will reveal to us the hidden order of...
the weather, - the stock market, human behavior. - I know. You can tell the future.
I know.
when you know which strings influence which outcomes, you can grab those strings and manipulate those outcomes.
with the sequence, we can control the future.
if you're not comfortable with this, then by all means, you can leave.
just remember that I know everything about you.
I'm the only person standing between you and your kidnapping charges.
and if you're in jail, what will happen to William?
LINUS: Really, your test results were remarkable.
I'm just glad I qualified.
here you go.
one of the nurses will get you settled.
make yourself at home.
uh, wh...
what are you doing in here? Who-who are these guys?
ms. Farington is worried about security.
listen, these people need to believe this is an actual legitimate sleep study.
I can't have these goons wandering the hallways.
I grabbed the doctor's journal before it fell into the wrong hands.
you should be thanking me. - Good for you.
just try not to scare anyone, okay?
and take that to my office.
sure.
Where've you been?
out for a walk.
yeah?
for an hour? - I like long walks.
Hi, it's Dr. Linus.
the tremors are worse today.
I brought my concerns to Dr. Linus...
Oh, my God.
Oh, there you are.
there's a problem with the machine in seven's room.
I'll be right there.
Dr. Linus wants it handled immediately.
what are you doing in here anyway? - Just, uh... just...
looking for a pen.
take these.
what is it?
they help you sleep. - Oh.
everyone's nervous at first.
please sit.
and this will track your brain waves while you sleep.
please.
you'll be asleep in no time.
please.
I believe there's been some sort of mistake.
in that day, the Lord will take his terrible, swift sword and punish Leviathan, the swiftly moving serpent, the coiling, writhing serpent.
he will kill the dragon of the sea.
I'm afraid I don't understand the meaning of this.
thank you. Thank you.
do you see that?
perfectly normal side effect.
please.
right.
Thanks.
think sleepy thoughts.
I recalibrated the machine in Ms. Plimpton's room.
great. Then we'll start with her.
we have a new subject?
we do. A walk-in.
didn't even have to recruit him.
amazing.
is the new patient... Is it a boy?
about 11 years old?
no. Why?
Oh. Nothing.
fine. Let's begin.
do you ever have trouble sleeping?
well, I have these dreams, and I wake up and I can't go back to sleep.
but I'm fine.
Jake seems to sleep all right.
he's always out when I check on him.
Yeah.
if something's ever wrong with him that I don't understand, you have to tell me, okay?
okay.
Jake has all this information, like, coming at him all the time.
h-he sometimes doesn't know how to turn it off.
but he hears you coming down the hall, so he just pretends like he's asleep.
he doesn't want to make you worry.
all I ever do is worry.
Trevor, what's happening?
I have to move fast. It won't be long before they realize I'm gone.
okay, look for medical files.
anything that's gonna help us figure out how they're hurting the patients.
what are you doing out here?
Oh, I'm looking for the bathroom.
you should be out cold.
damn it.
I need to get you guys out of here.
no, you have to go in there.
if you don't, there's a 94% chance someone will die.
okay, I'm gonna leave the car locked.
don't let anybody in. If you have to, call the police.
I'm gonna step outside. I'll call you back.
I should call Dr. Linus. - That won't be necessary.
Hey. There you are.
sorry, seems his dosage was wrong.
my screwup. I'll take care of it.
what's going on?
you're Calvin Norburg.
Yeah, I know.
what are you doing?
I'm creating a feedback loop, so they'll get a continuous stream of data.
if the system doesn't receive an input for more than three minutes, an alarm sounds.
probably should have factored that into your plan.
there's no plan. I'm a patient here.
I have insomnia. - Now, look, I'm trying to help you, okay?
I know you're working with Martin.
Jake is the only one who could've sailed through the test like that.
where are they? - Look,
I don't know what your agenda is here...
if you go wandering around this facility without my help, you will get caught, and they'll never find your body.
you have to trust me, okay? You have no choice.
what are you doing here?
I think he just saved my life.
the study is killing the patients. I have evidence.
follow me.
I found Dr. McCormick's journal.
aster Corps sent someone over to the morgue to get this earlier.
same guy who broke into my house.
they must have known he was keeping records of his symptoms, logging his complaints.
what exactly are they doing to the patients?
it's similar to my experiments, but much more prolonged and intense.
the patients start out fine, but over time, the process shreds the frontal lobe.
Trevor, let me see your phone.
after a while, the damage is permanent.
they can't recover.
what's your angle? Why are you telling us this?
listen.
I know you think I'm a monster, but I can't stand by and watch this happen.
these people stay here, they're gonna die.
we can't get them all out before Linus realizes what's going on.
we need to call the police and shut this place down.
the police will take too long. There's a patient-- Dr. Plimpton.
she's in real trouble. We have to get her out of here now.
Oh, she came back. Come on, let's go.
all right, this way.
is she gonna be okay?
once she gets some rest, her brain should be able to repair itself.
okay, there.
they'll be getting data for the rest of the night.
Dr. Plimpton, can you hear me?
what's going on? - It's okay. It's okay.
we're gonna get you out of here.
I have to get back to the lab. They can't know that I helped you.
if there's a problem on the way to the hospital, give her this.
it should stabilize her. - How long do we have before they start to realize they're watching the same data over and over?
not long. As soon as they know that she's gone, they're gonna order a complete lockdown.
you have to get out of here now.
good luck.
slowly, slowly. Trevor, come here.
help me get this off of her.
Dr. Plimpton, here.
great. Let's see what's happening with the new subject.
sure.
Dr. Linus, I know I've had reservations about your methods, but you've done some amazing things here.
well, thank you. I appreciate that.
you are a pioneer.
I can't tell you how much it means...
wait. Wait. I think there's some kind of glitch.
we're not getting new data.
it's the same information, over and over, like...
like it's on a loop.
he's clear. We can go. - Martin, they know.
what? - Calvin just texted me. They know.
they're gonna lock this place down.
we need to get a passkey.
Dr. Plimpton, do you have your key on you?
Dr. Plimpton, please.
what?
53. Jake showed me that number earlier.
it's too loud.
nothing.
come on, think. Think.
the first three digits of the Amelia sequence.
I got a passkey.
no. Damn it!
give her the shot now.
now!
hold her still.
come on.
she's stabilizing.
slide on over, sweetheart.
is she gonna be okay? - She's gonna be fine.
Martin, you get her to the hospital.
I'll call Detective Lange and send him the evidence.
okay. Thanks.
wipe all the drives.
we can't leave any records. Let's go, people.
the police will be here any minute.
time to go. Quickly now!
what about the patients?
we'll be long gone before they're questioned.
out now.
what is the meaning of this?
I must apologize for the crudeness of our methods.
but I can assure you, it was necessary for your safety as well as ours.
I was given a mission by one of the 36.
please...
I must go.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
he will be here by tomorrow morning.
everything will be explained then.
wait. Who will be?
who is holding me here?
listen, Aster Corps is a Fortune 50 company.
why go to these lengths for some number?
I can't explain it.
this isn't the first time they've killed people, and it won't be the last.
aster Corps takes what they want, no thought to who they hurt.
and they always get away with it.
Yeah, well, not anymore.
Hello?
we just dropped Dr. Plimpton off at West Los Angeles Regional Hospital.
she'll be safe.
we're on our way back home. I'll call you as soon as we get there.
Trevor, thanks for everything.
I'm just glad everyone's all right.
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
there's nothing more terrifying than the future.
and nothing more inevitable.
it's happening.
what, sweetheart?
what's happening?
there are some futures so devastating, you can't imagine surviving them.
No! No! No!
so you fight and you run.
but no matter how far you run, or how hard you fight, the future catches up.
fate catches up.
on this sunday before the primary
when we will go to the polls to exercise our blessed franchise,
our lesson comes from exodus, chapter 18.
and it came to pass on tomorrow "That moses sat to judge the people:
and the people stood by him "From the morning unto the evening.
and Moses judged the people.
and he shouldered this tremendous burden all alone.
and one day, his father-In-Law said to him, "Moses, why do you carry this "Awesome responsibility by yourself?
you need other wise men to help you rule "Justly over the people.
so moses hearkened to the voice of his father-In-Law, "And chose able men to rule over the people.
can I preach it like I feel it?
this tuesday,
when we choose the men and women
who will lead our city,
we would do well to keep those standards in mind.
men of truth,
who fear god and hate covetousness.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
God bless you.
good to see you.
how you doing? - Just fine.
how's mama? Tell her I said hello.
fellowship committee at 2: 00: - If i'm late...
we'll wait. - All right.
thank you for coming, young man, young lady.
Reverend. - Councilman.
Mrs. Carcetti. How are you?
thank you so much for having us.
thank you. - Lnteresting sermon.
polls seem to think you have a chance.
well, we're within the margin of error.
margin of error. That's an interesting phrase.
and I see you've got delegate Watkins working the crowd.
well, I'm hoping he's not going to be the only one.
I'll tell you what, councilman.
I will keep an open mind until I walk into that booth on Tuesday.
and if you win-- - You're holding me to a high standard.
Moses? I mean, jesus, reverend... - Tommy.
I'm sorry. I can't believe I said that. - Moses will do for now.
we'll save jesus for your second term.
have a good one now. Thank you all so much for coming. - Thank you.
signs o' life? - Not even a lookout.
maybe they went to church. - Our lady of the re-Up.
he'll show up sooner or later.
call me. - All right.
vote for Carcetti.
vote for Carcetti on Tuesday.
Tommy Carcetti running for mayor. Thanks.
Hello, councilman. - Good morning.
I've been following your campaign. I'm a teacher.
excellent. - High-School biology.
what? Here in the city? - Baltimore county. I just wanted say
I think your position on school-Boardreform is very encouraging.
so you'd vote for me? - If I lived in the city, I absolutely would.
good luck on Tuesday. - Thank you.
they're all fucking county people. - We're almost done here anyway.
Thomas, look at this. - What's that?
check it out.
in your private practice, you ever represent a Bobby Harrison?
the slumlord? Fuck, no. I don't remember ever even meeting this guy.
Carcetti got the most serious charges dismissed "And the others reduced to small fines.
the slumlord once again walked free with a slap on the wrist."While hundreds of tenants continue to suffer - "Substandard living conditions." - Last-Minute smear. They're running scared.
Royce. - Who else?
65% of the city rents.
Bobby Harrison's name is dirt in this town.
two days before the election and they smear me?
courthouse steps. When the fuck was this taken?
it's a fake. They photo-Shopped me. - We have time to prove that?

if we can prove this one's a fake
I didn't work at "sun" papers for 22 damn years Not to know somebody.
I'm gonna call paul mccardle at the photo library.
and if we still can't find it? - Then we put out a fake photo of our own.

we'll take care of this.
you can't do this to us.
bey took the weight for all y'all.
and you've been amply compensated.
but time moves on. - Not for bey, it don't.
what i meant to say is there's no more money coming in.
no more business.
avon is gone. So are his people.
shit.
you seem to still be doin' all right for yourself.
there's nothing more i can do for you.
bey know everything. You forget that?
and what's he gonna do? Who's he gonna tell?
and what do i care if he does?
bey never heard me say a damn thing about business.
what about your brother?
avon could be gone longer if bey gets to speakin' his mind.
I couldn't care less about avon.
the thing is i wanted you both to hear it from me
so there ain't no lies from here on in.
she even paid enough over the last two years
that you should have enough money going forward, son.
your father has not been disrespected here.
you both got what was coming.
but ain't nothing lasts forever.
jailhouse snitch? - Called last overnight.
worden talked to him. Says for a deal, he can give us the case.
no shit. - Gonna write up a writ,
send it over to the state's attorney's office,
get them to sign off on it first thing tomorrow morning.
what's the rush? - We jump on this.
we cause a major shit stink right before the election.
if this guy really knows why the witness-- What's-His-Name?
Braddock. - --Was killed, - Might be bad for the mayor. - If it's not bad for the white boy, carcetti.
you care, either way? - Fuck no.
I don't give a shit either way. I don't even vote.
but it'll be fun to fuck with them downtown suits.
maybe get you on the 1 1: 00 news.
get a little payback for all that shit they put you through.
with only two days left before the primary,
campaign officials traded charges today
over a controversial flier distributed
in some african-American neighborhoods.
what seemed to be a secure lead for the incumbent mayor
has evaporated in recent days.
the latest "sun"-Wqmd poll
shows the two men in a virtual dead heat
with councilman tony gray trailing.
4% of the likely voters are still undecided,
and with the prim
I can't wait for it to be over.
Yeah, me either.
can that flier hurt you?
you know, we found the original photo In "the sun"'s files.
they grafted my puss onto some perp-Walk shot
on the courthouse steps. I'm standing where some sheriff's deputy was.
Oh my god. What a nasty business.
Royce is swearing he had nothing to do with it.
claims it must've been somebody freelancing.
well, norman and terri say not to worry.
it's all in the game.
you know, when i was 15 points behind,
I was resigned, you know?
a landslide, i could live with that.
I mean, what else did anyone expect, anyway?
white guy runnin' for mayor in baltimore?
but this:
Jen, if i lose this here by two points, it's gonna kill me.
it's gonna just fucking kill me.
you gonna have to step up now, nay.
a'ight. - Be the man of the family.
you older than your daddy was when he went out on the corner.
that's what i been sayin'. Damn. He quit school.
you ain't quittin' school.
not yet. - Ma.
but you are goin' out on your own.
you gonna ask bodie for a package.
what if he say no? - I ain't take no for an answer.
just did. - What you mean?
from brianna. - Hand me the damn phone.
what she say about you already gettin' paid enough money?
she a lyin' bitch, namond. You see?
there's a lot about this world you just don't know.
what it come down to is she know you ain't gonna snitch.
no matter what shit she pull. - She got that right.
she takin' advantage of you, bey. She takin' advantage of you.
sound like she got it all figured.
bitch got it figured out, all right.
she cuttin' us loose without notice. Nothin'.
like comin' home, findin' our shit in the street, bey.
she don't give a fuck about you, avon, none of it.
she had the nerve to talk to me on this,
Iike she gonna set things straight
so i don't tell no lies.
Jen, i'm sorry. He said he'd be up.
he's already gone to the office.
well, what's he doing there?
he couldn't sleep. He's been there for hours.
shit. See ya.
and given that we still have a shortage of officers
willing to work secondary at the polling stations,
we're asking for anyone interested
to contact tactical this afternoon.
next order of business: fresh warrants,
beginning with murder and weapons charges - Anyone know this mutt? - Oh, yeah!
who'd he kill? - Some lady in a store.
reads like a taxpayer. - A taxpayer?
from what this says, he's charged with felony homicide,
to wit: murder in the commission of a robbery.
about fuckin' time someone got some paper on that motherfucker.
anyhow, we got no fixed address, no known abode.
but if apprehended, Contact detectives holley - and crutchfield in homicide. - You wanna find omar little?
you look for a corner boy running away from a corner
with shit in his pants.
you ever know omar to do a citizen?
anyway, pass these around.
Jesus, tommy. - I spent a couple hours
going over the latest data, rearranged the schedule.
Tommy. A little bit of knowledge
there's a bunch of middle class black precincts
which are strong on tony but still have a high undecided.
I think we can pick up some votes
those people hate the mayor. You're gonna get those votes, - And if you don't, gray will. - We go door to door today.
as long as they don't go to royce.
I need some black votes if i'm gonna be mayor.
I need some kind of mandate from that community.
if i sneak in with a bare plurality...
we might just win this thing. - What do you think kept me up all night?
with all due respect to your early-Morning analysis,
we got three back-To-Back drive-Time radio interviews
I wore out my kneepads to get.
the people running your campaign are professionals, tommy.
don't try this shit at home.
you know, there might just be a job for you In a carcetti administration
press secretary, chief of staff.
get in the fucking car.
Mr. Prez.
can you come with me, please? - What'd i do?
get here early. I'll let you in, and you can shower.
my dirty clothes?
put 'em in this bag, leave 'em in the locker.
I'll bring 'em home and wash 'em.
go ahead and get cleaned up. You'll be late for class.
skanky ho. - Damn, she good, though.
yeah yeah. You right about that.
Hey, yo, tiff, baby. I got 50c too.
fuck y'all.
damn. All three at once? You know she could.
I know you could.
sir. - At ease.
man, i hate it when the bosses creep below the eighth floor.
Yeah, well, i need a moment just to unclench my asshole.
sir? - The braddock investigation.
it's coming. Norris and greggs are wringing it out.
I fuckin' know it's coming.
commissioner burrell had a visit first thing this morning
from state's attorney demper himself,
asking why one day before the primary
our detectives were trying to writ out a jailhouse snitch.
the tip came when it did.
I didn't push it, and i didn't hold it back either.
let the chips fall where they may. - Exactly, sir.
sergeant? Fuck your falling chips.
if braddock was killed because he was a witness
and we break the case one day before the primary,
Royce hates us forever-- And royce might win the election.
if braddock was killed for any other reason And we break it today,
then carcetti hates our guts-- And carcetti could win.
I see your point.
tactical tells me we're still about 20 bodies short
for manning the polling places.
I want you to detail two detectives
to uniformed election duty immediately.
Lemme guess: norris and greggs.
sounds good.
they're to report to tactical at 1 300 today For election orientation.
they can pick up their writ And talk to their snitch on wednesday.
american democracy.
let's show those third-World fucks how it's done.
Yes, sir.
I have what i think is some very good news for all of you.
we're going to be implementing
the university of maryland pilot program.
you're only taking three of my knuckleheads?
a total of 10 children from the eighth grade
in this first class-- Eight boys and two girls.
if things go well... - It's a start.
when? - This morning.
Hallelujah. Not a moment too soon.
how was l? - Good on steiner.
better on the a. M. Talk shows.
I thought you handled that call about the fliers well.
fucking royce.
if i lose because of this bullshit
you lose, we can blame it on 10 different things. Same thing if you win.
guess who i just got off the phone with?
state senator davis. He wants a meet.
clay davis? Why would i wanna get into bed with that motherfucker?
he didn't actually come out and say it,
but it sounds like he's ready to follow watkins - And jump the mayor's ship. - What's he want in return?
Shee-It. Same thing he always wants.
at least 20k to his favorite campaign committee is my guess.
maybe even 30, 'cause you know clay ain't cheap.
well, i'm not promising him anything policy-Wise.
you think clay davis gives a fuck about policy?
Naw, this is strictly for services rendered.
he might be conning us
taking the money, then sitting on his hands.
maybe. But then all we have to lose is money.
could be the extra little push we need on the west side.
set it up. - I already did.
Lnvert the denominator-- - What invert mean?
the numerator and the denominator switch places.
turn upside down. - Why you do that?
because it works. That's the formula.
excuse me, mr. Pryzbylewski.
Namond brice, darnell tyson and zenobia dawson.
grab your things and come with us, please.
quiet, quiet.
calm down, please.
What'd we do? We in trouble? - Just come with me.
shit. It's the story of my life.
they ain't coming back. - Yo, mr. Prezbo, they gettin' arrested?
no... - ???
yo, nay, can i have your xbox?
cause you ain't gonna need it where you are.
What'd they do?
Markeith, kwame and latonya.
bring your things and come with us.
again?
you know i can't publicly endorse you. Not at this late hour.
then what are we talking about?
I lay back and not do what i usually do on election day.
I see you all get a push In the seventh and ninth districts, say,
and maybe that piece of the 1 1th west of freemont.
I split some of my tickets for y'all.
I split my walkaround money.
you know, the usual to-and-fro.
politics is a good thing, pardner.
that's a minority opinion.
let's order.
I'm hungry enough to eat the horse you ride in on.
if you don't mind, we're a little busy for a sit-down lunch.
Oh, no doubt.
just leave enough for the tab.
Naw, she is crazy. She says you were there.
I wasn't. Besides, it wasn't even rape. She wanted to.
how do you know? You weren't there.
I saw her go in with them. - Go in with who?
this is no time to play, young man.
you are in very serious trouble.
who did you see her go in the boys' bathroom with?
paul and monnel.
paul and monnel? And what were you doing?
lookout. - So you were involved.
but i didn't even see what happened.
you were standing guard. - No, listen, monnel gave me $5 and just told me to stand by the door and holler if someone came.
this isn't even fair. I didn't even do anything.
you stood lookout while two eighth-grade boys - raped an eighth-grade girl. - But she wanted to.
that's not what tiffanie says.
there'll be an investigation. You'll be suspended.
you could very well be expelled,
maybe even face criminal charges.
Mrs. Donnely, please don't.
Mrs. Donnely, please don't call my foster mother.
I'll tell you everything I know about this.
I know all about it already. - No, but I know some other stuff,

we feel will benefit from the special curriculum
and the smaller class size.
we've chosen 10 students from the eighth grade
to participate in this program.

heavy turnout all around.
big lines on the west side might be bad for us. I dunno but
we're out here in west baltimore, - The heart of his political base. - This is today?
this is live, right now in lafayette square.
clay davis just said his whole organization Was out going door-to-door for royce's ticket.
so much for laying back on the mayor.
we paid $20, 000 for this shit?
he probably went to royce and shook him down for another 30. Motherfucker.
clay davis must know something we don't.
he knows just enough to get paid twice.
gotta blame ourselves for payin' this thief up front.
Hey, it was worth a shot.

Thanks, yo.

you some kinda democrat or what?
voter turnout was heavy all day across the city
with some precincts reporting lines
as soon as the polls opened at 7: 00 this morning.
election officials, however,
reported few problems throughout the day.
now the polls have closed,
officials at the board of elections downtown
have begun the tedious process of tallying the vote,
prepared for what could be a long night.
with just over half of the city's 316 precincts reporting,
councilman Thomas j· Carcetti has a narrow lead of 2%.
traditionally, those precincts that report latest
tend to be from west baltimore,
which is expected to favor mayor royce in the late going.
how it go? - Good. Nothin' to it.
I'm countin' on you, nay.
exit polls done earlier in the day in key precincts
show voters divided over the challenges facing this city,
such as crime and education.
since this race tightened in the last couple of weeks,
I've been saying that this election
would be won on the ground.
and whoever has the best field operations will take it.
it's all about the turnout, and this is something
what about bond?
all right. Talk to you in a few.
bond's running really strong against demper.
looks like we might have a new state's attorney.
what does that mean for you?
well, demper's royce's boy.
dare to get your hopes up, Tommy.
you know what? Let's get outta here for a while,
take a walk.
I'll get your ass.
pretty. - A little ripe.
well, can't do anything about the way the harbor smells.
people are gonna expect you to.
I guess.
you sound confident. - I have a feeling.
could be a great city again.
pull some jobs in here.
people move back, fix up the houses.
it's ringing again.
Terri.
maybe you should answer it. I don't need an update every five minutes.
no, we should go anyway. - Do we have to?
I'm sure they're frantic. They don't know where you are.
yeah?
taking a walk with my wife.
on our way.
Royce is conceding.

I think so.
I think we are.
Yeah.

thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please.
I want to thank you all for your hard work and dedication.
give yourselves a hand. Come on.
I just got off the phone with mayor Royce and councilman gray.
they were very gracious. I asked for their help.
I mean, we still have a general election to win.
is there a republican candidate For mayor in baltimore? I don't know. I'm not sure.
but, assuming that we win, we still have
we still have a lot of work to do to turn this city around,
and we need everyone-- Everyone who's willing to join us
in making a better baltimore for our children.
I don't want to make a long speech. Believe me.

he's right.
BUTCHIE sent us.

I'm here on a 22-55.
I talked back.
Moolie: - Moolie.
he said that in front of you? - He made a point of it, in fact.
you're the one said I oughta shore up my base.
you didn't call him on it? - The ironies of democracy.
a vote's a vote. And i never throw one back.
speaking of ballots, did you vote for me, Norman?
the sanctity of the voting booth
is a cornerstone of american democracy.
I gotta go. You need a ride? - Yeah.
come here. You're the best. - Thanks, Norman.
Yeah, take a break. - You got it.
one day. Two days. - Come here, you.

I have a feeling you might.

scotch okay? - Sure.
you know, I gotta admit, it feels good.
you deserve it.
you worked hard.
I did. I do.
Cheers. - Cheers.
you know, when I took this job, you promised me a win bonus.
well, you earned it.
I can't do this. Not now.
come on, Tommy.
you haven't changed.
hell, from what norman tells me,
you nearly fell off the campaign trail for a blonde
at the stonewall dinner two months ago.
he had to drag you out of the bar.
it's not that I don't want to
you're feeling a bit mayoral. Right.
you're onstage now.
four years is a long time for a fellow like you.
this could be your last chance for a while.
you sure?
maybe you have learned something.
write me a check.
all that from overnight?
all that from Freamon.
he's out early today rooting through empties.
you know what he is?
he is a vandal.
he is vandalizing the board. He is vandalizing this unit.
he is a Hun, a Visigoth, a barbarian at the gate, clamoring for noble Roman blood and what's left of our clearance rate.
and you sit here doing what exactly?
a hot shot, maybe.
I got a sack in the box, says he owns one from a couple days ago.
white Coat Alley.
what the fuck is wrong with you people?
is everybody on a crusade to make more murders out of bullshit?
the mope's confessing, Jay. He walked up to the Western desk to do it.
well, at least when you go to manufacturing a murder, Eddie, you already have a suspect in hand. I respect that part of your game.
Oh, that others might learn.
I need a witness for the statement in box number one.
Yeah. Let me dump my shit. I'll be there.
sodium cyanide.
you're telling me, if we do a full tox screen on this kid, he comes back positive for cyanide:
Yeah. That's what I'm saying, okay?
you need to lock me up because I killed that boy, I did.
I did it. I did it. So just lock me up and be done with it, all right?
Where'd you get the cyanide?
you getting sick there, Bunky?
when's the last time you had your medicine?
no. No, I'm not getting high anymore, okay?
let me ask you again:
Where'd you get cyanide from? If you're saying
fuck! - I'm sorry.
shit. He got my fucking sleeve. - I'm sorry.
just calm down. We'll get something to clean this up, and maybe a soda or something.
get some sugar in you at least. - I'm sorry.
he settles down, I'll Miranda.
Yeah.
fuck.
???
steals like my ex-wife's lawyer.
Jesus.
get up there.
come on, come on, come on! - Give me a sec!
call 911. The mutt in box one just tried to hang himself.
no idea on this one.
two on this block and three off Lanvale.
they cluster.
and when they found a block they liked, they came back on it.
one on the next block, across Gilmore.
that makes nine.
scary thing is we're only looking at one district.
shit. One sector.
how far you think they might have roamed?
there's only one way to find out.
excuse me. Daniels.
how we doing with Forensics?
that's the colonel's domain, but my understanding is that we're sending a lab team to every house.
so far we're finding 9-millimeter casings.
once they start scoping at the morgues, we'll probably have slugs to go with them.
Tracewise, we're laser-printing around every body and vacuuming every crime scene for hair and fiber, but, of course, these are vacants.
it'll take our lab a year to sift that many bags of dirt.
is this all from one drug crew? - Probably.
Marlo Stanfield's bunch. - Where are we on them?
major Crimes was working wiretaps until three months ago, - but we came down on those. - Can we get backup?
trying, but Stanfield's people may have changed up the pattern.
well, Colonel, whatever you need.
actually, what I need is Patrol.
patrol Division:
that was Detective Freamon on the phone.
we found two more at Lafayette and another on Lanvale.
Jesus Christ.
now starting at the first scene, we've been going door to door, but there's no telling how far the shooter wandered.
and with 15, 000 vacants in the city, it'll take my people weeks to cover that ground.
he brings this case in, he'll be closer to the throne.
look, I wouldn't worry about Daniels.
he's a long way from my chair, as are you.
you made your move too soon.
I did.
politics doesn't suit you. Stick to operations.
and don't you ever cross me like that again.
get it out to all the bulletins.
Leander, go downtown. Run a flier for every roll call.
show them the nails and the screws in detail. All right?
you grab a couple of those nails and hit all the hardware stores.
find out exactly what the model is that we're looking for.
what do you need from me? - Herc.
I'm serious. Get hold of him.
how's he looking?
pretty good, considering. No worse than before he hung himself.
the fuck are you going?
west Side. Freamon found another.
fucking Freamon.
he a transport: - Borderline.
B. P. and pulse are normal.
we gave him Ativan for withdrawal.
Hey, you want to go to a hospital?
let me ask you something:
what kind of a fellow rigs up a hot shot, then walks into a police station to talk about it?
who does that:
you want us to wait? - No.
what is in your head, fella?
the hot shot was for this motherfucker that has been beating on me.
and the boy?
he was dipping.
I knew he was. I just didn't-- I didn't think...
the child had no one for him
no mother, no family.
he in the street like I'm in the street.
so I tried to...
like I ain't know who I am, right?
like I'm pretending I ain't been a dope fiend my whole damn life.
just lock me up, man.
cause I killed that child.
the shot wasn't for the kid.
let's throw this one back.
this sad-ass motherfucker's carrying more weight than we'll ever put on him.
what about the clearance?
fuck the clearance. - Cut him loose?
shit, he'll go off a roof or some shit.
my luck, I'll catch that call too.
maybe D ward over at Bayview, something with soft walls.
is you out of your mind, nigger?
you think I'ma pay you twice for the same motherfucking package?
Hey, I'm in the same box here.
faggot took my shit same as he took y'all's.
man, but that's on your own people.
your guys was the ones doing security on this shit.
Hey, they worked it the same as we did the last dozen shipments.
y'all was fine with it up until this, right?
ain't no one have a problem with it till the motherfucker gave us one.
thing is, Joe, we calle a quorum on this, took a vote that says it's your people need to make this right.
no no, a co-op means share and share alike.
you share the good and you share the bad.
all right.
I'll dig deep and do the full shipment if that's what y'all need,
but don't even think about coming back to me for a re-up after this, 'cause when that good raw shit comes straight off the boat, it's gonna be mine only, seeing as how y'all can't find the heart to stand with me now.
you want to quorum up again, think it over a little?
Yeah, I thought you might.
I'll get word back that we need a fresh shipment, and right quick, and you can think about what we need to do to improve security, make sure it only happens the once.
what's up, young'un?
which one of your people was in charge of the stash?
I mean, I want to talk to him.
my nephew. My sister's boy.
I can't give him up like that.
I can't do it.
my connect had people there when the shit went down.
if that's what you need to make you believe, you can hear it straight from him.
we are rich.
that's what I'm talking about.
???
my man.
right, now, girl, you set that off slow, you feel me?
cause word gonna get around. They gonna come back on you now.
Nah. None of that.
yo, anybody ask about me on another job, tell 'em, "Kimmy been retired." All right?
be easy.
how much you got left after splitting with the Mexicans?
26 raw.
gracious.
shit, only problem, man, I'll spend the rest of my life trying to put that out on the street.
I ain't no drug dealer, Butch. You feel me?
shit, we just stole too much this damn time.
so, what am l gonna do, Butch?
well...
you could come give Joe a call.
offer to sell the shit back to him now for 20c on the dollar.
Joe would have found some humor in that.
I know you do.
I understand there's a waiting list.
the thing is this kid has already been in a foster home.
right.
and now his foster mother's been hospitalized, so
right. No.
is there a supervisor that I can talk to?
I'm gonna be a little late for roll call. Gotta get this kid settled.
what's wrong with D. S.S?
on the phone with them right now. hey're talking about a group home.
so? Either you come up with a guardian, or he goes to Social Services. No two ways about it.
Hello: Hello:
need your help. Get dressed.
I'm suspended with pay, pending a full trial board.
can't do nothing for no one, Kima.
fuck what they say. This here's police work, and I'm asking if you police.
all right. Listen up, you mutts. This is complicated.
I mean, it isn't complicated if you went to college or,I don't know, your mothers actually stopped drinking for a minute while they was pregnant.
but for Baltimore City Police, this is complicated.
anyway, this right here is for the Major Crimes homicide investigation into the bodies being found in the vacant houses here in Western.
command now wants all the districts to check every vacant in the city.
that means you will need to go door to door to every vacant house in your post and look at what was used to board it up.
most will have the Phillips head screws that H. C.D. uses, Iike this here on the flier.
but if you see a house that's been boarded up with nail-gun nails like these shown here, call your sector sergeant immediately.
you can enter the house, but if you find a body, do not disturb the crime scene. All told.
but what I don't understand is why they keep busting my balls about this.
I mean, Daniels gave me a slap on the wrist for the thing with the minister, right?
and Marimow got bounced just before he could fuck me up on anything else.
you sure we on the right block?
Yeah. Put them on the curb right here, more or less.
and then you fired the nail gun into the asphalt, - right where they sat? - Yeah. Right next to the little broad's leg.
so who tells these l. I.D. fucks to start running through my paperwork, looking for who the fuck cares?
I mean, it's not like they caught me stealing or brutalizing motherfuckers, right?
right? - Look.
Yeah. It looks like it could be. Is that about right?
Yeah.
must have worked himself free.
I took them nails to Ballistics.
comparer said he could match anything out of that gun, and maybe the nail gun itself, if we could get it.
I mean, I know they're gonna take my stripes, but you don't think they're gonna go past that, right?
herc, what'd you do exactly?
lost the camera I took from l. S.D. without my lieutenant's approval.
and what evidence I got from the camera,
I put to a made-up informant.
son, they're gonna beat on your white ass like it's a rented mule.
fuck.
then make him sign it.
did it to himself, that cocksucker. I hate that bastard.
he called him cocksucker.
?
you're gonna break that call button.
look, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to bother y'all, but I don't get but four channels.
that's all you get.
what about my man over there?
he has insurance.
and insurance pays for his cable hookup.
only reason you're admitted is that fracture.
soon as we can discharge you, we will.
all you gangsters wash up in our E. R. like it's your due.
you could stand out there slinging drugs till you get shot or cut, have us put you back together free of charge so you can do it again.
gangster, huh? - Oh, you're not that?
I pulled your admissions.
you were here in '90 for a gunshot wound, and three years before that, you were here for chest surgery for a cutting.
long time back, yeah.
and I see you're still at it.
Dennis Wise, I'm Howard Colvin. - Are you police?
I... used to be, but now I'm a bit of a teacher up at Tilghman.
I got a little problem, and you know Carver over at the Western, he said that you might be able to help me.
I went up to your gym. They told me what happened.
what is it that I'm supposed to know about?
it's Namond Brice.
Yeah. What's the problem?
Oh... shit.
well, I've just come to care about the kid.
you heard it was Little Kevin?
I seen one of the police step out the household with his necklace.
that's Kevin up in there, yo.
this motherfucker be killing niggers just to do it.
see?
nigger killing motherfuckers just 'cause he can, not 'cause they snitching, not 'cause it's business, but 'cause this shit just comes natural to him.
yo, Bodie, man-- - I mean, Little Kevin is gone
this nigger don't feel nothing.
and all them motherfuckers in them rowhouses, - nobody mean a fucking thing to him. - Bodie, calm the fuck down.
fuck Marlo, man! Fuck him and anybody that think it's all right to do people this way.
you hear me?
fuck all y'all motherfuckers.
get the fuck off me, man.
that's his friend in the bag.
it's like that nigger ain't fit, man.
you see that shit, yo? - Go on. Lock his dumb ass up.
Attica! - the number of victims discovered shot to death in the boarded-up buildings.
how flattering for us.
it knocks the school deficit right off the front pages.
there's your silver lining right there.
those bodies are on Royce. - School deficit should be too.
should be, but that's a problem that's gonna play out in the next fiscal year.
by then you're out of Teflon.
so I take the governor's money, and then two years from now when I shake the hand of any voter in the D. C. suburbs, they say "All right. You're the guy who needed my tax dollars to bail out your school system."
if you take his check, you lose votes in Prince George's and Montgomery, and you can't beat him statewide without the counties.
but two years from now, if you're governor, you can help the city from Annapolis.
he's the mayor now.
I agree we can't fix the city schools, but we can't let them get any worse either.
go back to Annapolis. Eat his shit.
if we lose local control of the schools, Nerese and the teachers will rip you, but the rest of the city will see you did it for them kids.
kids don't vote.
taking a risk with our supply, ain't you?
I mean, setting up a meet with anybody other than us.
got to. The boy craves reassurance.
boss, you get that boy Marlo in line on our connect, he might try to go round the co-op, go round us.
you know what I'm saying?
cautious as those Greeks be, who you think they gonna trust?
they know us. They don't know him.
damn. - Look at this nigger coming round.
easy, son. Easy.
Yeah. I might have known I'd find you boys in here, burning that oil after hours.
nigger, I'ma kill you twice.
Oh? So you don't want your shipment, huh?
say your piece.
well, it just so happens I got some heroin for sale.
Marketwise, you fellas look like buyers. You feel me?
this some shameless shit.
Oh, ain't no shame in my game, dawg.
I'm here about the business. Ain't that right, Joe?
how much? - 20 on the dollar.
10, nigger.
don't make me say 25 now.
that's 400, 000.
how about we take your faggot ass in the backroom and get into some diabolical brutality, find our shit the old-fashioned way?
feel me? - Oh, I feel you.
sounds like a plan.
I don't know though, Joe. You think Omar gonna give it up?
20 on the dollar it is.
say, how's she ticking, Joe?
I'll be in touch.
and he thinks I'll help the schools, help the city a lot more if I'm governor two years from now.
I'm thinking that way it wouldn't just be about me if I don't take the money.
are you asking me what I think?
I think you'll do the right thing.
for real, I'm telling you the truth.
you sure you want to do this?
I don't want to hurt you.
???
detective Crutchfield, do you have a moment?
Yes, ma'am.
is something wrong?
I've got a question on these reports.
were they all found in the basement?
no, ma'am. We've been finding most in the basement, but some are on the upper floors too.
can you be specific in the 24s, for my sake anyway?
no problem. - Thanks.
how many so far?
17. - Christ.
that's a lot of red names.
it's your first "Red Bull.
Yeah. I thought I'd get a nice, quiet domestic or two to start me off.
we got national press on this already.
you'll be fine, Ronnie.
just don't let any of these guys see you sweating.
Hey, I need a case dropped.
to tell Mello to sign off, I need a friendly A. S.A.
he kicks out a radio-car window, and you wanna give him a walk?
what's the date range as per decamp?
the one on Mount Street looked about a week.
some a few days, some are skeletal at this stage.
they all head shots? - Multiples, most of them.
black males, 15 to 25? - Uh-huh.
no, some older.
we got one in a security guard's uniform around here somewhere.
you laser-print? Vacuum the rooms?
Yes.
Gluco for blood? What's the geography?
13 on West Side, Baltimore to Winchester,Schroeder to the Grove.
schroeder to the Grove.
the Eastern boys found four more in the houses on Monument Street.
east Side? - Yeah. That threw us.
we're casting a wider net now, searching the vacants citywide.
my number's 23 in the office pool.
I still have hope.
hell of a case, right here.
you know, if I was police,I don't think I could lean back on it. You?
I don't think I could lean back on it. You?
not if I was real police. - Right.
thank you, Detective.
Calvin, you done already? - Yeah, I'm done.
attention, a reminder:
answer sheets must be turned into the office by you and only you immediately upon completion of the tests.
thank you for your cooperation.
where are we on the nail gun?
a Hilti DX model.
high end, but common among contractors.
is it what Sergeant Hauk saw in the back of Chris Partlow's truck?
we showed him one, and he thought so.
then we dragged his ass back down to the block where he did the car stop.
anything?
we found what might be a hole where he said he fired into the street, but no nail, even after sweeping the block with metal detectors.
probably took a ride in some bastard's radio, but now it's in a tire pile somewhere.
so our next move is a search and seizure on that truck.
along with a court order for hair and blood from Chris and Snoop both.
with everything we're pulling out these houses, we might get lucky with some tracework.
what's your P. C? - Herc sees the nail gun.
nothing wrong with owning a power tool.
what's the P. C. on Chris and Snoop specifically?
a witness
the boy who was told by a co-conspirator who the murderer was.
the boy is a source. He's not a witness.
if he's just a source, you don't have enough.
no, but with the links that we got between some of these bodies and Stanfield and his organization, we have a pattern.
weak. Very weak.
Oh, fuck it.
give me an hour.
you haven't left me alone all week.
every time I come out of the pool, - Dennis Wise. - Hey, man.
Yeah. Were you able to get some word?
on my say-so, he's willing to sit and hear you out.
but what you asking him for-- I don't know.
good luck, though.
if you see my man Carver again, you tell him he owe me one now.
all right, man. Appreciate it. - You got it, bro.
all right.
y'all coming back with a warrant?
the roughneck in room 232.
from what I know, he runs a gym program for kids.
he got himself shot for trying to pull a kid off the corner.
look, you need to speak up now, or face the fact that you never spoke at all.
they wouldn't let me see my son at marches.
said there wasn't much left by the time y'all found him.
we did the best we could with the information we had.
word come to me that a man named Chris and a girl named Loop or Snoop or some such took my son and killed him.
told me I would never see my boy again.
why can't you just make an exception in this case and move his name to the top of the list, see that he gets another foster parent?
the list is the list.
some clients have been in group homes for years.
he was in group homes for years.
now he's gotta go back because--? - Please don't raise your voice.
if you're going to raise your voice-- - Please.
there's gotta be some way that he doesn't have to go
Yeah, there is.
there's gotta be.
how about
how about if I take him as a foster parent?
the screening process takes three to four months.
this child can't be in your custody, Sergeant.
he needs to come back under our supervision per the juvenile order.
think you all that for hassling niggers and shit?
I know I'm all that.
I'm thinking about some pussy.
Yeah. Me too. - Mm-hmm.
they dumped their tools.
nothing under the seats. Nothing in the glove box.
registered to some little old lady, no doubt.
these guys know the drill.
can you see these two riding tail?
come on.
shit.
there it is.
it ain't even our truck.
but I need to hear it from you.
from me:
this is not my affair, huh?
it is what Joe says. I'm only here right now for Joe, who I trust, who I respect, who I worked with for many years.
you I do not know, and I don't need to know.
but because this thing goes wrong for Joe, then
well, how am I supposed to know this ain't no setup?
how am I supposed to know your people ain't in on it too?
you know because Joe says and because I say.
and you trust your people like that?
I talked to my driver.
I looked into his soul.
Chris and Snoop just been popped on a gun charge, found in the truck.
call the bondsman.
but first, put a follow on him right there.
who, white dude with the hat on?
what, he a problem?
I just need to know more.
all right. - All right.
satisfied?
$90, 000 to you in the morning.
we'll put a hunt on Omar later, after the heat on them empty houses gives way.
the fuck are you doing here?
you think that charge gets dropped without somebody showing you some special love?
you hungry?
come on.
all right. Might be surety bond on this Chris Partlow, given all of his priors.
Pearson woman-- not so much. All right?
what's this?
court order. We get blood and hair.
14 head hairs, 14 body hairs, two blood samples each.
it's a lot of houses, a lot of deeds.
who knows what you left behind?
we still in the city?
Cylburn Arboretum. Pimlico's right up the hill.
this is nice.
I ain't no snitch.
I didn't say you were.
I've been doing this a long time.
I ain't never said nothing to no cop.
I feel old.
I been out there since I was 13.
I ain't never fucked up a count, never stole off a package, never did some shit that I wasn't told to do.
I've been straight up. But what come back:
you think if I get jammed up on some shit, they'd be like, "All right, yeah. Bodie been there.Bodie hang tough. We got his pay lawyer. We got a bail."
they want me to stand with them, right?
but where the fuck they at, I mean, when shit goes bad and there's hell to pay, where they at?
this game is rigged, man.
we like the little bitches on a chessboard.
pawns.
yo, I'm not snitching on none of my boys
not my corner, and not no Barksdale people, or what's left of them.
but Marlo-- this nigger and his kind, man, they gotta fall. They gotta.
well, for that to happen, somebody's gotta step up.
I'll do what I gotta. I don't give a fuck.
just don't ask me to live on my fucking knees, you know?
you're a soldier, Bodie.
hell, yeah.
I remember you.
you used to be a roll-up on Pennsie and Fremont.
Yeah. It was my old post.
I came up with C. B.S. - Calhoun, Baker, Stricker.
Yeah. I used to have to bang up on y'all all the time.
I remember that too.
Yeah. I ain't a cop now, right?
I mean, like I told Cutty,
I'm sort of like a teacher now, and that's how I come to know Namond.
only reason I'm even here is Cutty spoke for you.
he say what I'm asking?
your boy is smart and funny and open-hearted, and he got some flex in him.
and I ain't see it at first, 'cause he was always acting out, always full up of corner talk
you know, just talking shit to hide himself.
but he could go a lot of places and do a lot of things in his life, be out there in the world in a way that, you know, didn't happen for you and me.
I mean, you know, our kind? Shit.
man, we both know we gonna go to our grave forever knowing what block Bentalou dead-ends at, or who got their liquor license over at the Underground, or what corner Tater man got shot on when he come out the Musical Lounge back in '88.
it's a vision in gold.
the West Side we knew it's dead, man.
you know, people in the game nowadays, I mean, it's a whole different breed
no code, no family, and damn sure no respect.
I mean, you send Namond out on the corner now,
I'm giving him maybe one, two years before he down at the morgue.
and maybe, if you're lucky, up here with you.
maybe, maybe not. That's the game.
I'm talking about Namond here, Mr. Brice.
he's a lot of things, a lot of good things.
I mean, before you know, he might surprise all of us given half a chance, but he ain't made for them corners, man.
I mean, not like we were.
that's why I come down here because I gotta believe that you see it, being who you are and all you've been through.
you know your son.

Yeah, but I'm asking.

no, a hooptie, I think.

man, we can't have nobody snitching on us now.
we ain't sure it's that.

Huh-uh. Send a message.
maybe give it to your pup, get him started.
you and Snoop, y'all lay low till this shit here blow down.
boy worked for Bodie.
first time, best be someone he ain't know.
you hear what Joe said?
Joe's saying this cocksucker who stole our shit wanna sell it back to us for 30 on the dollar.
Joe's saying it's another 90 to buy back our share.
Dag, yo. Thought you forgot about me.
Hey, why don't you wait outside, all right?
you spoke to his father?
if it goes the way I think, he'll be back with his mom by tomorrow.
big day all around tomorrow.
delegate Watkins got us 30 minutes at the mayor's office.
Icicles!

Bodie, come on, man.
I don't know about this.
mayor's office. Yes.
actually, you want the Department of Housing and Community Development.
look, I don't know about this, man. I just...
ma'am...
if... sorry.
if the mayor prefers not to
if he, like, feels more comfortable with Dr. Parenti alone, you know because of the drug-legalization controversy last year...
I don't think Mayor Carcetti is in your meeting. He's in Annapolis.
okay. Thank you.
what up?
still asleep?
early bird get that worm.
how you liking the crib?
fine, thanks.
must feel good to be on your own.
yo, where you get that ring from?
took it from a nigger.
Why? You want it?
nah nah. You keep it, Shorty.
I'll go get Bug ready for school.
you ready to put in work?
two things then:
first, we're gonna give you the corner up on Payson. Used to be Bodie's old corner. Now it's yours.
crew that up. Run that shit.
you get the points on that shop.
then we got this other thing.
yo, if I ain't stepping on nothing, who was that who dropped for you, yo?
bug's daddy. - Word?
that's not how you spell "paraphernalia.
how the fuck do you spell it? - Hey, fellas.
not like that. McNulty. Hey.
you're here 4: 00 to 12: 00, right? You heard about Bodie?
what about? Yeah yeah. What? - Bodie, from up Payson.
shot dead on his corner.
midnight shift caught it. Check the readout.
sergeant, get your ass in here.
God damn it, Sergeant, you're on the brink of insubordination.
you call D. S.S. right now and ship him out. That's an order.
lieutenant
I got $235, if it helps.
how would that help:
maybe we can get a foster spot like that-- pay somebody.
this is tracking, plain and simple.
no, it isn't. it's a socialization process.
but to any parent who complains, you're still segregating them.
but I mean... it's for their benefit, and for the benefit of the teachers trying to teach.
and you're proposing to expand this to every middle school?
with enough grant money and your support, yes.By September.
but you wouldn't be teaching test curriculum here?
these would be the children left behind, so to speak.
Yeah, but as it is, I mean, we're leaving them all behind anyway. We just don't want to admit it.
what we mean to say is-- - Gentlemen...
we'll be in touch.
so what, that's it?
after a two-minute hearing, they stick a fork in us?
I'm a liability in there, man.
seems like every time I open my mouth in this town, I'm telling people something they don't want to know.
it's not you. It's the process. - The process?
when we get the grant, we study the problem, we propose solutions.
if they listen, they listen.
if they don't, it still makes for great research.
what we publish on this is gonna get a lot of attention.
from who: - From other researchers, academics.
Academics?
what, they gonna study your study?
when do this shit change?
and you put him out, huh?
he need to get hard.
well, if he out, then he out.
Oh, no, you're not.
you ain't gonna take my son away from me, not for this
remember who the fuck you talking to right here.
remember who I am.
my word is still my word.
in here, in Baltimore, and in any place you can think of calling home, it'll be my word. They'll find you.
man come down here to say my son can be anything he damn please.
except a soldier.
Yeah, well, look at me up in here.
who the fuck would want to be that if they could be anything else, De'Londa?
so...
did you cut me off too?
you still got me. We'll get by.
but you gonna let go of that boy.
bet that.
quien es?
it's Omar, baby.
for your bank?
that's for your pain, Butch. I be my own bank now.
they ain't follow you?
Nah. Joe paid it my way.
he had to admit my word was better than his. You feel me?
let's go then.
he is in the van, in the garage in the back of 2249 Polk Street.
the key gonna be in the cinderblock.
you steal this much, and this ain't over.
this ain't over.
thing about that Republican ass, it's not the flesh of his political fathers.
Jesus.
you left it on the table. - Smug son of a bitch.
he was gonna make me beg, then call a press conference so the world could see me on my knees.
don't worry.
two years, and we'll make him pay.
icicle, icicle! Got those icicles!
shakedown!
corner's indicted. Go on. Get.
except you, motherfucker. On the wall.
sorry about Bodie.
I ain't jacking you up. I'm trying to do right for your boy.
who dropped him? - Y'all did.
they took him out 'cause he was talking to y'all.
word is they seen him with the police down at Central Booking.
so cuff me or kick my ass off this corner before you do me the same.
Hey, Duquan.
don't you need to be at Douglass?
I'm on my way there, yeah.
Where's your book bag?
Oh, it's-- I'm gonna stop past the house and get it.
it's a present for all you did.
it's for your desk.
that's great, Duquan. Thanks.
stop past anytime, let me know how it's going with you.
okay.
but I ain't want to go back. - Program's ending, Zenobia.
Yeah, boy. Back to gen pop.
Yes.
pack my bags.
what about you?
I mean, this was all right...
but maybe it's time.
why are you up?
you're working 4: 00 to 12: 00. What's the matter?
something with these bodies.
Lester and them are getting up on it.
it's under Daniels.
he's got suction now.
he can deliver.
you want in.
I just feel like I owe it now.
to who:
to this kid. Corner kid.
getting ready to turn him, you know, wrap him up and give him to Lester as a present.
he one of the bodies in the houses:
no, they dropped him in the street.
maybe I'd be different, you know? - Different:
Yeah, no more of the drinking and the whoring and all that. All that anger.
cause I'm better now here with you.
no more playing "Jimmy Bust Balls" with the world.
Jimmy Bust Balls"?
I swear to God, Beadie, that son of a bitch nearly killed me.
it's okay.
what? - You tried.
you don't need to feel bad.
Thanks.
all right, Randy, this way.
take that top bunk over there.
are you sure?
I'm not asking 'cause I can't use you.
I'm asking for your sake.
I think I can do this and keep myself away from myself, if that makes any sense.
but I gotta tell you, we're not gonna get Marlo Stanfield or anyone else above the street, not on street rips.
what do you suggest?
either a wide C. I. or a Title lll.
that's what makes this case.
you sure?
maybe you do this fast and clean and simple.
then you don't do it at all.
chain of command, Colonel.
how in the hell do we kick up percentages in math and reading both?
you believe the numbers?
38% proficient. 8% advanced.
what?
Proficient" means they're at least two grades below their level.
Advanced" can mean they're at grade level or a year below.
they score 'em like that, andthey say we're making progress.
okay. I'm still learning.
Nah, you're gonna be fine.
Albert, Zenobia, Namond, good to have you back with us.
Yeah. Your worst nightmare come right back on you.
say, no, I'm just foolin'.
okay. Everyone open to 121.
who figured out the first problem?
Kareem? Correct. - 164.
how'd you get it? Come. Show us. - Don't know.
just when you think you're done.
what's that one? 20?
22. Anybody heard from Bunk?
ballistics say the guns match to nothing. Opened and closed.
and they cleaned the prints.
well, maybe we find a witness.
maybe trace lab gives us a hair or splatter or something.
but short of that, we're gonna have to go proactive.
where are you on the new body?
back to square one. We're in here for the long haul.
Colonel, how'd you happen to pick this place for us to stage?
Lemel: They closed it a few years back, and I knew it was near a lot of our crime scenes.
I went to school here back in the day.
got a decent education, now that I think on it.
you try and talk to him?
didn't know what to say. Only heard from my sergeant this morning.
guess I missed the 24 they wrote on it.
and he really tried to do himself? It wasn't just for show or nothing?
Bub's got some problems, but insincerity ain't one of them.
shame's some tricky shit, ain't it?
makes you feel like you want to change, and then beats you back down when think you can't.
when was the last time y'all talked?
more than a couple of years, since he last got on the wagon, I think.
if he's up in D ward, he's cleaner than a motherfucker right now.
you coming?
maybe later.
can't believe he'd leave that money on the table.
why not?
school. Kids.
shit.
you ain't done enough of this here, I suppose.
they always disappoint.
closer you get, more you look all of them.
who you going with next year?
if he tries for Elijah's seat, I might stay with Royce.
if not, there's this young buck out in Salisbury thinks he can snatch up the First District seat.
mistletoe. Come get 'em.
?
you can look him in the eye now.
no matter who he is or what he's done, you look him right in the eye.
I'm still your father.
what you want?
right to the body.
that's right. Keep it moving. Where your eyes at?
where you looking-- what you looking at?
Hey!
??? You cannot be out here.
y'all need to find something constructive to do with yourselves.
go on.
the gun.
Na', you're gonna be late.
go on. Go.
boy, where's your plate?
yo, Tyrell, wait up.
[men Speaking Spanish] Last night I had an ugly nightmare.
Oh, yeah?
what happened, man?
I'm lying down in my bed. Then I get up...
and there's my mother, may she rest in peace...
seated in a chair with a plastic bag over her head...
and she can't breathe.
and I can't help her. [Spits]
fuck.
what do we do?
we'll give them a half hour.
who are they?
don't worry. It's just the police.
this is a private road. You have to have a permit.
do you have a permit? - I don't have a permit.
do you have a permit?
well, then, we have a problem.
can we buy a permit?
Yeah, but it's gonna cost you.
how much? - Four hundred pesos.
you too... 400 pesos.
what's underneath the tarp?
boxes of food. - Show me.
lay down on the ground, sweetie. You're under arrest.
Yeah, you guys are screwed!
what's your name?
javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.
javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.
you've done an excellent job.
but we'll take over from here.
put the prisoners in the Suburban and impound the truck.
how did you find out about this?
a little bird told me.
what's the name of your little bird?
it doesn't have a name.
those fucking anonymous ones!
for an officer of the state police...
you're very well-informed.
Hey, was that General Salazar? - The Big Boss himself.
what is he doing around here?
up to something. I don't know.
they took our handcuffs, Manolo.
[Man] This informant, paid by police, using taxpayers'dollars to continue his felony drug habit, was the link that allowed the police to raid a private farm, a working farm where honest Americans make their living.
the government, in its haste, has hired an army of criminals whose allegiance to the truth is at best questionable. - Mr. Rodman...
it's a shame that your client didn't use as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney, but, lately, the only variation I'm hearing in your argument is the name of your client.
you can stand here all day and argue the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates, but you're not gonna convince me...
that our government has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants.
furthermore, there is no sacred protection of property rights in our country.
you grow marijuana on your farm, be it an ounce or an acre, that farm can be seized...
and that farm can be sold.
what the hell is that?
you can tell a lot about somebody from this stuff.
it's from your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson. - A fishing rod.
what do you think they want? - Depends what state they're from.
uh... Arizona.
Arizona.
medicinal marijuana initiative.
or am I being cynical?
mark... I'm gonna miss you.
thank you for all your hard work.
[Judge] Hi. How are you today?
you've got a daughter. Why is it important to get a handle on this drug problem?
because it's an issue that affects all families.
but I'm planning on being back here as much as I can. - How do you feel about...
[Man] Okay, Gordon, no telltales: No scratching your nose, no clearing your throat, no crossing your legs.
[Gordon] I got it. - You got it, babe.
I'm cool, man. You just don't tell any jokes.
don't tell any jokes? - Don't tell jokes. It's a giveaway, Ray.
it's not a giveaway. - Every time you tell a joke, it's a giveaway.
don't tell any jokes. - You know what the problem is? You are too uptight, man.
why don't you loosen up, take a deep breath? [Inhales]
breathe in slowly. A little stretching maybe.
come on, man. They're looking at us. - Come on, man.
we're gonna get these motherfuckers. We know our shit.
can I get it? Can I get it?
Oh, baby, can I say it? - Say it. It's show time.
[Ray] We're looking for Mr. Eduardo Ruiz. We have a 2: 00 appointment.
[Woman] He's right down the hallway in the back room.
thank you.
[Ruiz] Come in. Hey, fellas.
[D. E.A. Agent] Come on, you guys. Get him talking.
get him outside. - [Door Closes] How you doing?
[Ruiz] I'm well. How are you? - I'm good.
look, what's up, Ed? We gonna move some white or what?
you guys ever bought a quarter ton before?
no? - [Ray] I don't think so.
[Ruiz] It's a big fucking deal, all right?
it's not like you can stick it in a condom up some mule's asshole.
how many peasants is that gonna take? You'd have a line from here to Mexico City.
you say show up at a time, we show up at the time and we're fucking sitting here.
sure I can't offer you something to drink? - I can offer you a joke.
you want to hear a joke? I got a joke, I got a joke. Come on, bro.
it's just a joke. Let me tell one joke. I'm gonna tell you a joke.
all right, why are hurricane named after women?
I don't know. - Because when they arrive, they're wet and wild.
when they leave, they take your house and your car.
it's true. - You didn't find that funny?
I chuckled. Damn.
fellas... that's us. - Yo.
okay, that's the van. Don't make your move until they get Ruiz outside.
[Ruiz] I told you there was nothing to worry about.
I got another joke.
come on. Please. - Just one more. Relax.
a guy goes, gets a tattoo put on his penis.
one side says yes, the other side says no.
on his penis? - Yeah. The words "yes" and "no.
so, his wife says, "Hold it. You tell me how to cook, how to clean the house...
who the fuck is that? - That's local.
what the fuck is going...
shit! Agent down!
get in there now! Go!
the vest caught it. Go ahead.
go. Shit.
[Grunts] Shit!
I think we lost him, Ray. - Yeah, I think so too.
[Screaming] - Don't fucking move! Get your hands... Move!
get out, you son of a bitch! Get out!
[Girl] Is this what they wear to go to sleep...
or do they hang out like this the whole time?
[Boy] That would be sleep attire. - It's like a smoking jacket.
he's gonna be smoking in a minute.
okay, who's the father of Greek tragedy? Anyone? Anyone?
okay, Aeschylus it is. His trilogy? The Oresteia.
this is fucking beautiful. Can anyone... Can anyone stop the Seth machine?
no. - That's correct. Score.
and "tragedy" is closed out.
[Boy Laughing] - [Girl] But wait.
is he her husband? - Yes.
Oh, hey, so, uh... you want to try something?
Yeah.
what are you doing? - Just watch.
what you're going to do is inhale the smoke and hold it.
what is this, like freebase?
not "like." It is.
okay, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.
hold it. Hold it.
see?
now you see.
[Woman] Oh, how... Oh, they're doing great.
look at how cute they are.
[Woman #2] Helena, he's doing so good. - Little Tiger.
[Helena] Little Tiger, I hope.
we'll be very happy if he becomes the next Tiger Woods.
so will his bank balance.
[Woman] My God. Duck? - Duck. Thank you very much.
Helena, you never order duck. - I know, I know.
it's not me who ordered it. It's somebody else.
well, he or she has very good taste.
I love duck, don't you? - It's delicious. Do you want some, Nan?
Oh, yes. Thank you. - It's such a fatty bird.
there's good cholesterol, and there's bad cholesterol, which is confusing to me.
Mmm, that's so good. - You know what they say about red wine.
it's good for you. There's cholesterol in my wine.
you're allowed to have your red wine. - The French do, don't they?
I'm European. I say that to my doctor.
I'm European. I'm allowed to drink red wine.
Oh, my doctor said it was fine when I was pregnant.
a glass a week. - After my amnio, he said, " Okay, now you can go and have a glass of red wine.
I had two. [Laughing] - [All Laughing]
did you have fun? - Yeah.
thanks a lot. - Can I bring the bag in the back with me?
no, sweetheart. - How about just my putter?
give me the putter. - All right.
in you get. Come on. We've got to go.
put this down here, okay?
that's where Tiger Woods keeps it. Thank you.
[Valet] You're welcome. - Okay.
David, you're gonna have to promise me, no swinging the club in the car.
[David] Okay.
[Man] Until you officially take over the Office of National Drug Control Policy, under no circumstances will you speak to the press unprotected...
without going through this office...
or having someone in the room.
there are a lot of interests in this town.
right now, they're scared of you.
the reason they're scared of you: Technically, you have veto powers over their budgets.
you'll also be meeting senators and congressmen, each with a specially prepared question.
they're questions designed for one thing... to make them look smart.
if you lecture them, they won't think you respect them.
if you treat them with utter humility, they will.
this is about your respect for them and the president's respect for them.
speaking of which, when he gets back from Russia and China, we'll get you two together for some face time, let you two catch up.
also, one month from today, you will give your first official press conference.
in it, you will outline the president's strategy for winning the war on drugs.
[Man #2] Judge, I just want to be clear about one thing:
I am not a partisan person, I am an issue person.
over the course of the next few weeks, if you allow me,
I will bring you up to speed on an incredible array of issues, the most important of which, in my opinion, Mexico.
I know everyone you're going to meet. I know what they want and why.
it is important that they like you.
it is not important that they like me.
that is why I can help protect you.
like you protected Landry?
[Clears Throat] I see where you're going with that.
if I could say one thing: Basically, a guy like Landry is so autocratic, he doesn't even know how to let himself be helped.
there's a political component to this job that the general didn't have any patience for.
general,
robert Wakefield.
judge, nice to meet you. Thank you. - A pleasure to meet you, sir.
Jeff, you want to excuse us? - [Stammers, Clears Throat]
Yes, sir. I'll be right outside.
have a seat. - Thank you.
you've done a fine job, General.
the Office of National Drug Control Policy...
is in better shape than when you found it.
I'm not sure I made the slightest difference.
I tried. I really did.
I think there are some positive signs. The work's just started.
I plan on seeing it through. You can count on that.
you're here for two years, three maximum.
What'd they offer you, a court appointment?
district? Appeals? Not Supreme.
this is a tough enough job. I plan on focusing on this.
you know, when Khrushchev was forced out, he sat down, he wrote two letters and gave them to his successor.
he said, " When you get yourself into a situation you can't get out of, open the first letter, and you'll be saved."
and when you get yourself into another situation you can't get out of, open the second letter.
well, soon enough, this guy found himself in a tight place, so he opened the first letter, which said, "Blame everything on me.
so, he blamed the old man. It worked like a charm.
he got himself into a second situation he couldn't get out of, and he opened the second letter.
it said, " Sit down and write two letters.
[Woman] Don't you want to know what kind of car it is?
it's a brown Ford Explorer. - It was here. It's been stolen. I want to file a report.
a report will not help you find your car.
the police won't find your car. - You are the police.
you call this man... and he'll find your car. - I don't get it.
how is this guy gonna know who has our car?
the police will tell him.
why will they tell him, and they won't tell us?
because we pay him, stupid.
right? And he pays the police, and suddenly our car appears.
es correct. Es correct.
just give him the money. Give him the money.
let's start moving to the sidewalk. - Here, take it.
no. No, no. - No, please, take it.
let's start moving to the sidewalk. Let's go to the sidewalk.
call the man. Have a nice day.
javier Rodriguez. - Si.
[Speaking Spanish] We want you to come with us.
where? - It's just a short trip.
follow me.
bien.
I would say one thing to you, Judge, and that's you're never gonna solve this problem on the supply side.
as long as that demand is out there in our cities,
mexico bashing is not gonna do a damn thing for you.
we in the legal drug business... Merck and Pfizer and the rest of my very important clients realize that we're not fighting a war here with a traditional winner and loser.
I don't know that you can win this war.
everybody says we want to declare war on drugs, but if 25% of high school seniors are using drugs...
lf you reduce that to 10, that's a great improvement. - Right.
I'll congratulate you. That would be a phenomenal achievement, but you'd still have 10% habitually using drugs.
can I get a scotch and soda, please?
[Woman] The price of coke and heroin has dropped, but purity has increased.
all this law enforcement has really achieved is that kids get better stuff cheaper.
education, rehabilitation, prevention...
that's not significant to these reporters.
Mm-hmm. - They want to see people in prison.
they want to see the gory aspect of the drug problem.
thank you so much for sharing your point of view.
I look forward to working with you in the future. - Well, call me.
I have a good bill on treatment-on-demand. I could use your help.
wonderful. Look forward to it. Thanks, Senator. - Okay. Great.
if a judge or a politician is willing to put a reefer in their mouth, - I'll do a story on it. - Right.
stand up and be independent. - Right.
I don't care who's president. I don't care who the members of congress are.
I don't care who you have to deal with.
if you're independent and you use that bully pulpit right, that's where your power is.
it's the stick of law enforcement that creates the carrot of huge profit that is economic truth.
addicts don't vote.
what the hell are you doing here?
you like your view?
TV screen big enough? - How's the food?
hope it's all good because this is as good as it's gonna get for a long time, Eduardo.
I'm a legitimate businessman. I've got tuna boats. I'm a fisherman.
check it out! - Shut the fuck up!
fucking can it, bitch! - You can't come in here like that!
I want to see my lawyer. - Okay.
it's cool, man.
Eddie... you're in a lot of trouble. - It's cool.
you know what? The amount of coke we found on this creep...
that's capital punishment in some states, right? - Yeah, down in Texas.
they'll fry him. - Definitely.
we've got him making the deal on tape.
we got him bragging about the quality, about his business.
we got this motherfucker. - You're fucked.
no, no, he's fucked.
I only see one way out of this predicament.
you make us believe you got a boss, Eddie.
look, no boss, it's all on you.
no.
no, that's a death sentence. I'd never make it to the trial.
look, we're gonna protect you. - [Ruiz Chuckling]
who you working for? - This is coercion.
that's a big word for a fisherman.
big-ass word. Who you working for?
I know another big word.
immunity.
take it easy, will you?
what's going on in here?
we have a warrant to search your premises. - What?
Carl!
my husband!
relax. Ma'am. - Carl!
ma'am, right here. You can't go any further.
David, come here! - [Agent] Ma'am, I have a search warrant.
he'll be back.
[David] Where are they taking Daddy?
he'll be all right.
he's all right. They're just gonna take him to the office and talk.
just relax. They're not going to hurt him.
I don't understand what's going on. - He'll be all right.
[David] What are they doing to Daddy? - Daddy's gonna be okay.
it's okay, sweetheart. It's okay, baby.
[Speaking Spanish] Not you.
you.
I'll wait here.
five years with the Tijuana police.
three years in the state police.
your parents died when their house flooded in the rains of '93.
how unfortunate.
that's what they pay.
well, look.
this could be your past.
we can talk about your future...
if you can do me a favor.
if I can.
I want to wipe out the Tijuana cartel.
what can I do to help?
his name is Francisco Flores.
he's an assassin.
he runs guns for the Tijuana cartel.
I have to talk to him.
I need you to find him and bring him here.
this is crazy! - Don't freak out, Manolo.
don't you know who "Frankie Flowers" is?
a hired assassin! A psychopath! Fucking crazy!
who knows how many he's killed! - Then I'll go by myself.
and we can't ask for help...
because he lives in San Diego.
well... is this a surprise or what?
an honor. Thank you.
Hi, sweetie. [Kisses] - Good trip?
how are you? - Good trip. I'm good. I just can't believe this.
what's Washington like? - It's like, uh...
it's like Calcutta; surrounded by beggars.
only these beggars are wearing $1, 500 suits...
and they don't say "please" and "thank you.
[Mrs. Wakefield] So, we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom have any expertise.
Superfund" is just one of those words.
people stop paying attention.
it's frustrating. - It's so frustrating.
did you meet the president?
honey, your father knows the president.
it just so happens... that the president of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has penciled me in for a little face time.
none of my friends can fucking believe my dad's actually the drug czar.
Caroline. - I'm sorry, but, I mean, come on.
it's great. It's great, Daddy.
it's just amazing, that's all.
Arnie, thank God.
Helena, I am so...
please tell me what's going on here.
what is going on? They came into the house. They just took him away.
they searched my home.
let me tell you what's happening. All right?
first of all, Carl is not here.
the D. E.A. Has got him.
they're gonna hang onto him until his arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.
so here you are wasting your time. All right? Are you with me?
Yeah. - Okay. Now, do not discuss anything over the telephone.
don't talk to your neighbors. Stay out of your yard.
what is he charged with, Arnie? - I don't know, but under no circumstances am I going to talk about it here.
now, you go home and be with your son. All right?
miss?
can I have a Budweiser?
excuse me. - Yes?
can you give me a cigarette?
[Speaking Spanish] It would be interesting to know how you did it so quickly.
we all have our weak side.
the path of the Lord is very subtle.
Amen.
what a badass. [Laughing]
[Caroline] All I'm saying... What I'm... What I'm saying is...
it never seems like anyone ever says anything that matters to them.
we all look at each other and nod with these...
these responses that we've been trained to make.
responses... Not real responses.
social conventions, like phony, fake smiles,
surface bullshit.
do I ever just say:
hey... I'm uncomfortable in this crowd.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing either.
I know you're afraid, and that's okay, you know, because...
Hello? Fucking... exactly.
we act like we have all the answers and we're totally invincible...
like our parents seem and their parents before them.
I'm sorry I have to be the one to say this, but it's fucking bullshit.
for instance? - [Seth] I know you jack off to Caroline every night, instead of Vanessa, who you're supposed to be in love with.
don't even get me started on that convention.
because what is that convention?
we're this random collection of self interests, and all of a sudden we decide...
that we're gonna walk two-by-two down the fucking aisle to Noah's Ark?
actually, for your information, when I jerk off,
I'm not just thinking about Caroline, I'm thinking about you with Caroline.
so, how about that? - [Vanessa Groans] Baby...
that is what I'm talking about... sarcasm.
always fucking sarcasm.
you're afraid, and you think that if you admit that, people will think that you are weak...
or they won't like you...
or whatever it is you think will happen, but...
[Seth] Can you shut up for one second and listen to yourself?
Wh-What?
because you are so fucking right.
I'm so fucking high. - [Laughs] Yeah?
Yeah. - Okay, wait.
why don't we...
change this thing, this social pattern?
[Seth] Why don't we be different?
Yeah. - But then why are you even talking about it?
but we're making it, like, from now on.
you're like, "Why don't we do something?
why don't you do something? - That's what I'm saying, Seth.
you do it yourself... - I'm saying if you knew it, you wouldn't even say it.
[Vanessa's Boyfriend] Vanessa, I'm serious, I feel fucked up.
[Vanessa] It's a social pattern, you know?
Spence, baby, are you all right?
he's fucking blue. He isn't breathing.
Oh, my God, Fucked-up Bowman's fucked up. [Laughs]
wait... - What the fuck do we do?
uh... Oh, God... - Fuck!
somebody call a doctor! - Wait, your dad's a doctor. Call him.
no, he's a research... Call your dad. He's a doctor.
what kind of research? - Mapping the fucking pig genome.
call your dad! He's a neurosurgeon!
I can't call my dad! It's 3: 00 in the morning!
he's gonna fucking die right here on the floor if you don't do something!
no, he can't die on the floor! His parents are in Barbados!
okay, nobody has anything on them, right?
fuck!
[Speaking Spanish] We know that you killed our chief of intelligence.
we also know that you killed police chiefs in Tijuana and Mexico City.
a question.
why do you resist?
my father has money.
that is not the correct answer.
we also found out...
that you hunted down a neighbor of General Salazar.
a poor peasant.
your people killed his granddaughter.
that was a stupid thing to do.
[Spraying Liquid] - You fucked up.
I'm on the board of my son's school.
I have fund-raisers for adult literacy at my own home.
I think I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
of course he is.
I've known Carl for 20 years. He doesn't even jaywalk.
Carl is a very important member of this community, and when we get through suing the police and the district attorney and the D. E.A. they're gonna be renaming the public parks after your husband.
Carl is very, very good at his business.
[Whispers] Which is smuggling illegal drugs into this country.
they're whispering. They're whispering. - I know.
can't hear it. - I know. The fucking bug's too far away from the room.
it's halfway to the kitchen. We're not gonna get shit.
they're saying something.
sounds like they're conspiring to conspire.
I can feel the lies vibrating from their home.
I don't think she's in on it, man.
come on, I dream about this. I have actual dreams about this.
about busting the top people, the rich people.
white people. Hey. - White people. I know, I know.
I don't think she's in on it, man.
she knows Arnie Metzger.
so does half of San Diego.
you want to bet? - Get in your pocket.
I got... - I love it. I love it when you do this.
how much you want to bet? How much? - I got... I got 12 bucks.
okay, give me ten. We'll make it even. - Okay.
beautiful. - Wait a minute. What?
[Woman] How old are you? - [Caroline] Sixteen.
live with your parents?
Yes.
parents still together?
Yes.
do you work? - I volunteer.
I read to blind people, one day a week for two hours.
in school?
Yes.
private?
Yeah.
how are your grades?
I'm third in my class. - What does that mean?
I get A's, all A's. - You do?
what else do you do?
[Sighs] I'm a National Merit Finalist.
I'm on the Hi-Q Team and the Math Team.
I'm in the Spanish Club. I'm a thespian.
I'm vice president of my class.
I'm on the volleyball team.
you want to tell me what you're doing here, Caroline?
Carol.
Oh, sweetie.
you okay?
it's okay.
[Wakefield] Caroline, how well did you know this boy that overdosed?
he didn't hang around us.
he was like one of those hippie kids.
I'm not part of that group.
how well did you know this boy Seth, the one that was driving?
he's a friend.
he's also the only one that was doing anything about the situation.
he definitely had a few beers, but...
it's not like he wanted to drive.
we just didn't know what else to do.
it wasn't my pot.
okay, we understand, honey. We've got to talk.
alone.
I think she's lying. - Me too.
so let's ground her, clip her wings:
school, scheduled activities till further notice.
Robert, honey, Caroline clearly used very bad judgment, but don't you think spending a night in jail is punishment enough?
I mean, we've all had our moments.
lord knows, I tried every drug there was... - I don't want to hear about that.
you experimented when you were in college.
shall we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it was?
this is different. - Why?
she's 16 years old! - I think she needs to find out for herself, on her own.
we have to allow her room to figure out... - You want to give her room?
so she can O. D. Like that other kid?
I am not sending out the message that our family will accept this behavior...
because we do not.
correct? - Of course, but we don't want to push her away.
she has to know that we understand what she's exposed to.
how long have you known about this?
how long have you known?
six months.
[Speaking Spanish] My technique is more profound than yours, Javier.
much more profound.
when he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here.
he will give me the names of his superiors.
then we get them and they too will give us names.
and eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon.
and on that day, the Tijuana cartel will fall.
what a disgrace.
what a disgrace, Francisco Flores.
it's all right. Salazar is here.
you're among friends now.
this shameful treatment will stop immediately.
guard!
Yes, General.
are you responsible for this?
we are not savages! - Yes, General.
has he eaten? - I don't know, sir.
go get him some clothes. - Yes, General.
your Honor, this is a man who heads a large criminal organization...
with international contacts we can only begin to understand.
our case against him is very strong.
he is not a flight risk. His flight is assured.
the people ask that Your Honor deny bail. Thank you.
my client is no more a flight risk than Your Honor or the able prosecutor.
he's a pillar of his community,
a family man with a wife and child living in La Jolla, the community where he has made his home for the past 20 years.
as our defense will quickly show, my client is guilty of nothing more than being the handy target of an admitted criminal.
therefore, we ask that you release Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.
I'm going to deny bail.
[Wakefield] I appreciate you coming in so early this morning.
[Man] Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it.
she's a minor. It probably would have expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
nevertheless, this is a sensitive issue for me. I'm sure you can understand.
like I said, open container, P. I. misdemeanor possession.
it's easy to make it go away.
one thing bothers me: The kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.
serious amounts. He's lucky he's alive.
so I've got to ask: What's your daughter on?
I don't know what you mean.
I mean... have you asked her what kind of drugs she's tried?
no.
I don't know.
is she in any kind of therapy, professional help? - No, no, no. No way.
my daughter is one of the leading students in her school.
well, I hope it stays that way.
[Wakefield's Voice] Yeah, hi, it's Robert.
I want you to clean out my schedule for the next three days.
because I'm tired of talking to experts who've never left the beltway.
it's time to see the front lines.
[Ruiz] Carlos Ayala started out in the family connection business...
real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic strawberries.
then he met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana cartel.
using regression analysis, we made a study of the custom lines at the border and calculated the odds of a search.
the odds are not high, and we found variables to reduce those odds.
so, you pay off customs officials?
well, you know, in Mexico...
law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity.
not so much in the States. Anyway, we, uh...
we hire drivers with nothing to lose and throw a lot of product at the problem.
some get stopped. Enough get through. It's not difficult.
look, boys, this has worked for years. It's gonna continue to work for years.
nafta makes things even more difficult for you because the border's disappearing.
do you realize in the next year or two at the outside Mexican trucking companies...
are gonna be able to go from the States to Mexico and back again...
with the same freedom as U. P.S. D. H.L. FedEx?
it's gonna be a free-for-all. - What, are we on Larry King or something?
[Gordon Laughs] Shit.
tell us something we don't know, Eddie.
you guys remind me of those Japanese soldiers left on deserted islands...
who think World War II is still going on.
let me be the first to tell you, your government surrendered this war a long time ago.
I don't think all this attitude is gonna help in front of a jury.
it's really a bad attitude. - Very bad. Very bad.
look, Ed, there's only one problem with all this math. You're in here.
well, I got greedy, didn't I?
Yes, you did. - Yeah.
decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.
Carl never would have been so stupid.
well, Carl hired you. That was a mistake.
Carl and I have been friends since we were little kids.
he was loyal.
Javi.
[Speaking Spanish] A group of us are going to a party.
who?
Esteban, Guzman, Tomas, all of them.
your new buddies.
Yes.
let's go. - No.
it'll be fun. - Another day.
at my house I have some B&W speakers.
a while ago I bought a CD burner.
I make CDs with the music I want.
just like I bought them in a store.
you and I have a lot in common. Not everything, but a lot.
we both studied on the other side with the gringos.
your father is an engineer, right?
my father... may he rest in peace... was also an engineer.
I've been into stereos since I was very young.
most people don't care...
but for me it's very important.
they say in Latin:
in vino veritas. Wine brings out the truth.
use this to write down the addresses of those bastards who killed my captains.
and not where they were last week, but where they are now.
where they are this minute.
and better yet, where they are going to be tomorrow.
you know where they are going to be tomorrow, right?
yesterday, forces of the Mexican Army, acting on an anonymous tip...
joined with police to arrest members of the obregon brothers drug cartel.
head of the Federal Drug Forces, Gen. Arturo Salazar, said in Mexico city...
that the sweep was a crippling blow to the obregon brothers...
who reportedly dominate the narcoti cs trade...
in the city of Tijuana and the rest of Baja california state.
general Salazar went on to say that the authorities were working overtime to confirm that Porfirio Madrigal, head of the rival Juarez cartel died last week during a plastic surgeery procedure.
here it is, here it is.
get out, asshole.
are you going to kill me? - No.
no, the Obregons will do that for us.
[Man] The port of San Ysidro, California:
45, 000 vehicles on average, 25, 000 pedestrians per day.
in the last six months, a threefold increase? - Increase in narcotics seizures.
would that mean, prorata, three times as much drugs is getting in?
that's a scary way to figure it, but I believe that's true.
in my heart, I'd love to say that we were getting 60 or 70%.
in the reality, we're more like 40 or 50% of the total that's approaching us.
and it's all big-dollar issues now.
that's the reason you're seeing a lot of these murders taking place.
it's one organization fighting another organization.
when things are good, people don't kill each other.
when things are bad, when they're losing dope, when they're losing drivers and guys are going to jail, people start killing each other.
how's David? - "How's David?"
Oh, he's terrific, Carl. Terrific. - Oh, Helena...
he watched his father being dragged away by federal agents.
he's just doing fine. - Okay.
I can't even begin to tell him where you are and when you're coming home, if you're ever coming home.
Helena... we're gonna get through this.
I promise.
I'll make it up to you. - Do you have any idea what's going on out here?
huh? Our credit cards are maxed.
the people in the bank... you should see the way they look at me when I walk in.
I have a letter from the government telling me anything I sell from the house will be taken against an income tax lien.
our fucking friends...
nobody will help us. Nobody will take us in.
nobody wants anything to do with us, Carl.
so, you just tell me how you're gonna make it up to me.
Helena...
just tell me what to do.
I'm not bringing a child into the life that I was brought up into.
I won't do it, Carl.
I want our life back.
Yeah, we're smarter. We know the difference.
hello. Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.
Hi, folks. - Hello. - Hi. Room 310, please.
okay, I need to see some I. D.S, please, and $28. - Okay.
man, I love this place.
I wish we could just stay here.
just be here forever and ever and...
make a little home here.
I want to, uh...
I want to have sex and then do a hit right as we're both coming.
okay.
[Gordon] The first time I got laid was on a beach just like that.
[Ray] You got a what on a beach? - Got laid, man.
lost my virginity, was a sophomore in high school.
that's cool. - Yeah, it was sweet.
did he treat you good?
[Gordon] Who's this guy?
I never seen him before. - He's going right for the kid.
David!
David, come back here!
mom, Mom. - Please, put down my son.
[Man Over Headphones] Shouldn't let your kid wander off with strangers.
[Gordon Over Walkie-Talkie] Karen, if he tries to move with that kid, you break cover.
Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes a lot of money. Snapping this kid's neck wouldn't cover it.
you better come up with it in a hurry or your kid is gonna disappear, and he won't turn up until the evening news.
you get only one warning. First payment is $3 million.
Javier. - Yes?
[Speaking Spanish] What's up, Ana?
manolo never came home last night.
come in, come in. Sit down.
I don't know where he is.
he wasn't with you last night?
no.
I'm worried.
don't worry too much. It makes you ugly.
do you want a coffee? Coffee with sugar?
no. - No?
look, Javier.
I was going through his clothes the other day.
look what I found.
what is it?
what were you doing? - I was with friends from work.
was Salazar there?
no.
the general is going to Mexico City next week...
and I'm not going to get left behind.
javier Rodriguez.
the word is you're not that happy in your work.
maybe we can help.
John, how are you? - Judge, welcome. - Robert Wakefield, pleasure.
good to see you. How are you? - Long time, no see.
[John] EPIC is very unique.
it's a facility that has over 15 different agencies... state and local...
that participate in gathering intelligence...
and making sure that information gets out...
to people in the field that need it to stop drug trafficking.
from here, we have the ability to track vessels, airplanes, boats, anything that carries drugs.
when the information comes in, we're able to check with different databases to see if it's in the system or not.
and would most of that energy be focused on the two cartels?
the Juarez, the Obregon brothers... Are those the two that would be most important?
those are the two clearest threats right now.
they are the dominant force in trafficking, both on the Mexican side and in the U. S.
how are the cartels achieving the level of intelligence and sophistication that they're showing?
[John] Craig, why don't you answer that? - An unlimited budget.
so, you're saying, actually, that even a country of our size...
and the budget that we throw towards this issue, - they can compete at the same level? - No, they're way beyond us.
way beyond? - Our budgetary process makes us pale in comparison.
[John] That house you're looking at over there used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.
his nickname was Scorpion.
I'll let you figure out what that means.
wasn't that the guy who died during plastic surgery?
best of our information, yes.
who do you interact with on that side?
nobody.
well, who has my job in Mexico?
your position doesn't exist over there yet.
[Wakefield's Voice] I want everyone thinking out of the box for the next few minutes.
what are we doing about Mexico?
come on, guys, out of the box. - [Man] Unlimited funds?
unlimited.
from a D. E.A. Standpoint, we need a vetted task force and matching funds.
and cut the red tape on getting them equipment and training.
come on, guys, I want to hear from everyone:
F. B.I. customs, treatment.
is there anybody from treatment on this plane? - No, Judge.
then, I want to know why there isn't anybody from treatment on this plane.
Yes, sir.
we need to take down one of these cartels... Juarez or Tijuana...
not because they're a symbol, but...
hell, they are a symbol. But because we need to send a message.
when Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler as his legal defense,
I send Ben Williams down to San Diego as a prosecutor.
Why? Because it's a symbol.
it's a symbol that we are sending the best.
it's a message that we're going after their top guys.
so...
right now...
on this flight only...
the dam is open...
for new ideas.
on a clear day, you can see Mexico City.
I have this place swept twice a day, so just feel free to talk.
I learned that back in Miami in '85.
u. S. Shut down the entire Caribbean.
it's a big game of whack-a-mole. You knock it down in Miami... - Arnie, I need money.
somebody... I think it was the Obregons... threatened David.
they want a first payment of $3 million.
Oh, Helena. [Sighs]
I'd give it to you myself, but I-I-I just don't have that kind of money.
please. Does anyone owe us money?
Yes, there are people that do owe you money, but nobody's gonna pay.
Carl's got too much heat on him.
what about our other businesses, our legitimate businesses?
don't we own a construction... - Laundromats wash the money.
just tell me something positive, Arnie.
give me some good news, for Christ's sake.
I'm sorry.
I just keep wondering what's gonna happen if he doesn't get out.
just never been on my own before.
always had someone. Always.
I remember the first time that I saw you...
little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.
somehow I knew even then that your survival skills were pretty well honed.
glad you think so, Arnie.
I just keep picturing a debt-ridden, 30-year-old mother of two...
whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.
I don't know anyone who wants to be with someone like that.
do you?
[Speaking Spanish] You two don't like me, do you?
miss, with all due respect, we don't have an opinion.
maybe it's because I'm going to have the nicest home you've ever seen in your miserable lives.
the old man actually kept his promise.
the general is a man of his word.
they will say anything to get what they want...
and then it's always tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.
occupational hazard, I guess.
[Laughs, Sighs] - The bags?
[Speaking Spanish] - My love, it's beautiful! How beautiful!
how are you feeling? Good?
how handsome you are.
listen...
the Scorpion is alive.
get in.
porfirio Madrigal isn't dead after all!
that means that Salazar is working for theJuarez cartel.
I can't believe this doesn't matter to you.
this is nothing new, Manolo.
that's why Salazar is so interested in cleaning up Tijuana.
and he has plans for Juan Obregon, the bastard.
that's right.
you know how much money he would pay for this information?
how much? - A fuckload of money, partner.
what's up, man? - Take off your glasses.
take off your glasses so I can see your eyes.
we're going to keep our mouths shut.
okay.
[Wakefield] I think we may have found our Mexican drug czar.
general Salazar.
be nice to have somebody to work with down there.
does this mean you're gonna be gone more?
possibly, yeah.
you might want to pencil in a little face time with your daughter.
Barbara... - Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
I think it's important we maintain a unified front.
if you start in on the war metaphors,
I'm gonna drive this car into a telephone pole.
I am as worried as you are. - Oh, I don't think so.
leave me alone. Give me some money.
that's what I get from our daughter.
she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
well, she has a way of self-medicating that I'm sure is very familiar to you.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the house and say hello.
I have one drink before dinner to take the edge off. It's different.
Oh, is it? - Otherwise, I would be dying of boredom.
why don't you go in and tell your daughter how bored you are?
[Wakefield] Caroline, open this door immediately.
who is it? I'm going to the bathroom.
open the goddamn door! - [Caroline] One minute.
excuse me. I have to go to bed.
Oh, Jesus.
you are not going anywhere, young lady.
you stay right there.
where are they?
where the hell are the drugs?
where are they?
fuck you.
fuck you.
I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
fuck me. Fuck me. Well, fuck you!
[Driver] Javier, good to see you. - How you doing, partner?
did you take the precautions we discussed about being followed?
Yes, of course. - Will you move to the middle, please?
you're not carrying a weapon? - No.
of course not. - Where are you taking me?
somewhere safe. - Where?
a place we have that we know is protected. He's good. Let's go.
[Javier] No, no. No, no, no. - Don't worry. It's really safe.
no, no, no, no, no. This is safe. This is safe.
come on, Javier, close the door. Everything is cool, all right?
this is safe. - Come on.
all right.
where would you like to go?
huh? - Where do you want to go, Javier?
[Javier] I believe it's important that we work together.
mexico and the United States. One hand washing the other.
we agree.
so, maybe you can tell me about your informants in our operations.
we thought that maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
this is a very different proposition, my friend.
we pay for that kind of information.
[Driver] Is that what you're talking about, Javier?
getting paid?
you like baseball?
[Spanish]
we need lights for the parks so kids can play at night.
so it's safe.
so they can play baseball.
so they no become... [Spanish]
everybody like baseball.
everybody likes parks.
listen.
I believe it's important that the United State take an interest in Tijuana now.
that's what I'm talking about, my friends.
[Helena] Account number...
a cash advance.
how much can I get?
that's it?
you ever try the patch, man?
the what? - The patch.
that shit doesn't work, bro. - It worked for my cousin.
no shit? - Yeah.
he had to wear five or six at a time, but it worked.
so, how's he doing now? - Oh, he's dead.
he's dead? - It wasn't from the patch, man.
[Agent Over Headsets] Okay, she's coming out. - On it.
what did he die from? - His wife shot him.
[Agent] She's leaving her property.
[Gordon] Where the hell is she going?
maybe her neighbors.
no, I don't think the neighbors are fucking with her too much right about now.
what does she have in her hand there?
[Agent] She seems to be headed for the van.
Oh, shit.
what... Wh-What do we do? - I-I don't know. What do we do?
what do you think she wants, man? - She's your girlfriend.
you think she'll invite you to her baby shower?
just say hello. Work it. - All right, all right, all right.
[Agent] She's waiting outside the van.
Hello? - [Helena] Would you like some lemonade?
I was just making some. - You want some lemonade?
sure.
[Helena] I know this is a difficult situation, and you're only doing your jobs.
I don't wish you guys any ill will or anything like that.
but I have a favor to ask you.
you're asking us for a favor?
some man threatened my child.
these charges have created so much attention, it seems to be bringing all the nut jobs out of the nut jar.
would you keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary?
sure. - Yeah, of course we will.
I'd really appreciate it. - Sure.
Thanks. - Thank you for the lemonade.
you're welcome.
I'm gonna get this analyzed right away, bro.
[Man's Voice] So, it was my birthday...
and my ex-wife was getting remarried...
and I was in some church basement telling a bunch of strangers...
it was a good day because...
I didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.
that was enough to send me out on a pretty big one.
I've been thinking a lot about the first step...
that I came to believe I was powerless over alcohol...
and that my life had become unmanageable.
my disease tells me that I don't have a disease, that it's my birthday and I can have one little beer, one little line, a little Valium.
six months later, I wake up in a sober-living house in Philly.
I'm from Dallas, people.
it's a disease, an allergy of the body, an obsession of the mind.
so, my name is Marty, and today I'm a grateful, recovering alcoholic.
and it's a good day because I didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.
Thanks.
Hi. [Clears Throat]
I'm Caroline. I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic.
I mean... I don't really like to drink.
for someone my age, it's a lot easier to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.
I guess I'm angry.
I mean, I think I'm really angry about a lot of stuff.
I'm just... not sure what.
listen to me. I built our house...
and I'm not gonna lose it.
[Carl's Voice] My business...
that would take a lot of private study.
I suggest... you look into the Coronel.
the painting? - Into selling it.
if you can stomach it, you should look into it.
Oh, my God.
[Salazar's Voice] Dear Judge,
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force.
I make the selection, putting them under a rigorous screening process.
and not only physically, but also psychologically.
judge, I'm sorry for boxes and the paintings and things, but I have been too busy to completely settle in here.
I know you've made very good progress with the Tijuana cartel.
congratulations, General. - Muchas gracias.
I am confident that before the end of the year,
Juan Obregon is gonna be taken into custody.
but you must understand that it's going to be a very difficult task...
because of the corruption in the police force.
hopefully, the exchange of training methods and information between our two countries will help.
I hope so.
on another note, General, we were talking about supply.
Mm-hmm. - What about demand?
what are your policies towards treatment of addiction?
treatment of addiction.
addicts treat themselves.
they overdose, and then there's one less to worry about.
[Counselor's Voice] What I want you to do right now is write down five triggers that could lead to your relapse, that could jeopardize your recovery.
five triggers. Your parents, something they could say.
anything that's a trigger for you. It varies from person to person.
some of us have already discussed...
Linda, we talked about it the other day.
I know you have trouble with your sister, how she's always kind of outshining you.
[Ray] Hey, sugar foot, how do you like your new home?
you got to be kidding me. This is not what my lawyers negotiated. - [Scoffs]
please. Fuck your lawyers.
you're not getting any goddamn cappuccino or...
[Ray] Biscotti. - Yeah, you ain't getting none of that shit either.
pick a bed. - Stay off the phone, Eddie.
no long-distance calls, all right?
use 1-800-CRI MI NAL if you do. - [Laughing]
[Man] Mr. Ayala first came to see me in January.
that would have been 1987.
he wanted to rent warehouse space along the harbor.
I didn't ask too many questions. I am a businessman also.
I was the company's secretary from 1991 to 1994.
I supposedly worked for all six companies, but they weren't...
I mean, it was just an empty office with a desk and a telephone.
I never sold anything the whole time I was there.
sometimes people came in, and they got paid.
I-I don't really know what they did.
[Prosecutor] Didn't Mr. Ayala say where the money came from? - No.
did you ask where the money came from? - No.
where do you think it came from?
[Lawyer] Objection. Speculation. - [Judge] Sustained.
[Prosecutor] I'll rephrase, Your Honor.
did you feel like you were engaged in a legitimate enterprise?
no, not really.
thank you.
you were followed by the police, but they won't be able to hear us over the children.
I want to use a bomb.
are you kidding?
can't you just shoot him or something?
I don't really like guns.
you shoot somebody in the head two, three times...
and some pinche doctor is trying to keep him alive.
when are you gonna do it?
I don't know.
Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.
security will be very tight.
I may not be able to get to him. - You'll be able to get to him.
if they can get to the pope and the president, you can certainly get to him.
careful. You're starting to sound like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.
[Sighs] Nobody saw her leave?
hmm.
no, I understand.
okay.
I gotta go.
I've got to go home.
did you want me to resch... [Clears Throat]
fine.
[Speaking Spanish] What's going on? You seem nervous.
because of Manolo. - [Spanish]
I'm afraid he'll do something foolish and it's going to get him killed.
Why?
he says he's going to sell information to the DEA.
they're going to pay him a lot of money.
what could he tell the DEA?
you know...
about Salazar and Madrigal.
Javier.
where is he right now?
I don't know. He took his passport and left.
give me a kiss.
don't tell him that I told you.
no.
what you want? Pot? Rock? Hey, what you want?
[Knocking] - Fuck!
what the fuck do you want?
it has come to our attention that Your Honor, while in private practice, previously represented the town of Seal Beach in their stop-work suit against the police department of Seal Beach.
we believe this disqualifies you from hearing this case, and we, therefore, move for a temporary suspension until it's investigated.
Mr. Adler, this is a most unusual motion.
nonetheless, Your Honor, we feel our client deserves every fairness afforded under the law.
I hope this is not in any way designed to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz.
we will recess until 9: 00 a. m. On Monday morning, and I will see counsel in my chambers.
[Flores] They are coming this way.
[Speaking Spanish] All of them are there.
[Speaking English] They are passing me now.
boy, there's a lot of them.
listen, would you mind if we walked back to the hotel today?
walk back? - Yeah.
[Flores] They're not getting into the car.
what are they doing?
they're arguing or something.
[Ruiz] It's two blocks. I could use the fresh air.
I've been stuck in that piece of shit hotel room for two weeks.
I don't give a fuck. Let's just stop standing around.
I want to walk 'cause I want to walk, not 'cause he wants to walk. - Let's walk.
I like that. Okay, we'll walk.
[Flores] They're going past me.
I-I-I do not know. I think they're going back to the courthouse.
this could be the last chanceto do this! Get out of the car and shoot him in the head!
[Ray] You're a fucking big man?
I'm a real fucking man. I don't fucking deal drugs to little fucking kids, you...
[Speaking Spanish] Fucking rat.
[Ruiz] You think you're a badass? - [Ray] I am a badass!
[Agents Shouting] Move, move! Get down!
[Agents] Go, go, go! We need an ambulance. - Go, go, go.
ray. Ray! Ray! Wait a minute, Ray!
Manolito, Manolito, Manolito.
[Speaking Spanish] What's up, Manolo?
looks like you're waiting for someone.
I'm just looking for the waitress.
I'm ready to order. Do you want anything?
a fucking salad? Something to drink?
no, no. Calm down, calm down.
what are you gonna have, Manolito?
a steak.
well, if you like steak...
we know a much better place.
you come with us.
javier had nothing to do with this.
it was all my idea.
punish me, not him.
do me a favor.
don't tell Ana I died like this.
tell her it was something else.
something official.
tell her I died doing something worthy.
forgive me, Javi.
put some muscle into it.
you too, Manolo.
you're done.
get out of there. - Don't you hear?
Javier, put the shovel down.
get out. Let's go.
I told you it wasn't his fault.
shut up.
turn around.
let's go, Javier. It's over.
don't be alarmed, Javier.
the old man works like this.
we had to go through the same thing.
we had to do this to be sure we could trust you.
now we see that we can.
we are family now.
sorry about the other night.
me too.
thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it has been a pointless journey.
why would you say that? - Bueno, pues, I hear these stories.
your husband in jail, his business in chaos, various people fighting over the scraps.
my husband was a victim of an informer in your organization, not in ours.
that is not true, Mrs. Ayala.
your route has been compromised.
perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
I don't think you're gonna do that. - You don't?
no. - [Laughs]
my husband was working on something he called the Project for the Children.
are you aware of this? - I don't know. Perhaps I remember something.
if you want to smuggle narcotics in Senor EspasticoJacobo, that is nothing new, Senora.
no, not in. The doll is cocaine.
high impact, pressure-molded cocaine.
it's odorless, undetectable by the dogs.
[sniffs] - Undetectable by anyone.
I don't believe you, senora.
I'm six months pregnant.
I won't do it.
then we don't have a deal. - Yeah, right.
we don't have a deal.
sorry to waste your time, Mr. Obregon.
okay.
okay, okay.
that's good coke. - It should be. It's yours.
I want our debt forgiven,
I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon brothers' cocaine in the United States, and I want the principal witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
have you told the complete truth during this interview?
Yes.
Alex? - Solid.
that's good shit, Javier. - You know, Javier, they dump those cell phones every 24 hours.
Yes, but I have a contact at MexTel who can get me his new E. S.N. In 12 hours.
that's good to know.
so, now that you have what you want, let's talk about how I get what I want.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
you're not gonna have any problems there.
Yeah, but first let's talk about what recautions you're taking to protect yourself.
you worry about getting me what I want.
I'll worry about myself.
Oye, Javier, you should feel good about this.
I feel like a traitor.
Helena Ayala just left Club Platinum, the Obregon brothers'place in Tijuana.
yeah? - She got stopped at the border.
she was clean, and she's back in San Diego now.
okay.
Hello? - Robert, it's Jeff Sheridan.
d-did I wake you? I'm sorry. - No, it's okay.
general Salazar has been arrested.
it turns out he has been working for Porfirio Madrigal and the Juarez cartel the entire time.
that is why he was trying to push the Obregons out of Tijuana...
so he and Madrigal could move in. - What?
I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought that had been verified.
[Sheridan] Apparently not. It is a shitstorm here, but the D. E.A. Supplied the information and was part of the sting.
so, maybe we can spin this a little, but I don't know what to tell people.
so, when are you coming back? - I'll try to get there as soon as I can.
[Sheridan] Yeah, okay, but... - Robert.
Robert? Robert?
I gotta call you back.
[Sheridan] What... - [Disconnects Line]
[Barbara] My Leica's missing. - She got the video camera too.
at least we know she's still alive. Where are you going?
pawn shops open in an hour. Ten minutes after that, she'll be at her dealer.
if I can find him, I should be able to find her.
[Teacher] Although ser and estar both mean "to be,
they have very specific uses.
may I help you, sir?
[Teacher] Excuse me!
Seth has to be excused. He's going on a field trip.
I can't believe you brought my daughter to this place.
whoa, whoa. Why don't you just back the fuck up, man?
to this place"?
what is that shit?
okay, right now, all over this great nation of ours, 100, 000 white people from the suburbs are cruising around downtown...
asking every black person, "You got any drugs? You know where I can score some drugs?"
think about the effect that has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities.
I... God, I guarantee you, you bring 100, 000 black people into your neighborhood, and they're asking every white person, " You got any drugs? Know where I can score some?"
within a day, everyone would be selling... your friends, their kids.
here's why: It's an unbeatable market force, man. It's a 300% markup value.
you can go out on the street and make $500 in two hours, come back and do whatever you want with the rest of your day.
you're telling me that white people would still be going to law school?
what do you want? - I'm looking for my daughter.
Caroline.
she's been here.
this is a business, man. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
I need to find my daughter, all right? I'll pay you.
all right. Okay. Hold on.
who in the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are?
why the fuck shouldn't I just put your ass in a Dumpster? - I got money.
I got money! - I got $1, 000 in my wallet.
it's for you. - If I want your money, man, I will take your money.
just tell me where my daughter is.
please? Please?
don't do that shit again.
look, Jesus, man, I'm telling you, don't do this vigilante thing.
either the cops are gonna find her, or she's gonna call you.
okay?
I promise.
ana.
[Speaking Spanish] If Manolo hadn't done what he did...
they wouldn't have been able to get Salazar and Madrigal.
he did something really good.
what's more, he did something important for Tijuana.
I would like to believe you.
you don't have to believe me...
because it's the truth.
the simple truth.
tomorrow I'm going to burn his clothes.
[Seth] I know she's in there. Just let me talk to her.
look, I know she's in there, man!
no, I fucking know she's in there!
Jesus Christ!
I-I haven't touched her.
you get the fuck out of here right now.
Hi.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, sweetheart.
[Agent] Hey, good morning, Eddie.
good morning. - Big day.
you're a star. [Snickering]
why don't you go take a shower, man? You smell.
who is it? - [Man] It's the Mafia.
I've got his breakfast. - [Agent] Coming.
so who's this going to? - [Ruiz] Over here.
Ooh. - Fuck off.
relax, Eddie. - Yeah, where has the love gone? Good-bye.
you know, you're gonna be testifying for about ten days.
we could just decide to stop feeding your ass.
you expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder?
wow, that's... that's heavy, Eddie.
can't you for one second imagine that none of this had happened, that my drugs had gone through?
what would be the harm?
huh? What would be the harm?
a few people get high who are getting high anyway.
your partner's still alive.
we don't have to have breakfast together.
don't you see this means nothing?
your whole life is pointless.
you're really breaking my heart.
the worst part about you, Monty... - "Monty"? [Laughing]
the worst part about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing, and you do it anyway.
wish you could see how transparent you are.
this food tastes like shit.
so, take your stank ass and go get a shower already.
let me tell you something.
you only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez cartel who's trying to break into Tijuana.who's trying to break into Tijuana.
you are helping them. Uh-huh. - Mmm.
so, remember, you work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
[Ruiz] Fuck me. - [Knocking]
who is it? - [Man] Breakfast.
hurry up. It's getting cold.
okay. One second.
get the fuck down! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
get down! Get the fuck down! - Hey, hey, I'm on your side!
what the fuck? - Oh, shit. Call an ambulance.
call an ambulance! Fuck! - [Agent] Palms up. Spread your damn hands out.
shit! Eddie! - [Groaning]
hold on.
Oh, shit! Hurry up with that ambulance!
shit. Hold on. Hold on.
your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, because of the sudden death of Eduardo Ruiz, the people have determined that we cannot continue our case against Carl Ayala.
Oh! Oh!
thank you so much. Thank you, thank you.
[Knocking] - Yeah?
Hi.
I got a copy of your speech.
it's fantastic.
so, Robert, my genuine thanks.
you're my choice. You're gonna be great.
the president's sorry he hasn't been able to spend more time with you.
after the press conference, he wants to really sit down.
Oh, and I got to the Post too.
don't worry about that thing with your daughter. It's not news.
they're willing to treat it as a family matter, personal matter.
anyway, if it came out, we could turn it into a qualification.
I've been in the trenches of the drug war.
I've seen the face of the enemy. Et cetera, et cetera.
[Woman] A sterling reputation and close friend of the president, recently confirmed into the Office of National Drug Control Policy, our new drug czar, Robert Hudson Wakefield.
the war on drugs is a war that we have to win, and a war that we can win.
we have to win this war to save our country's most precious resource...
our children.
sixty-eight million children have been targeted by those who perpetrate this war
and protecting these children must be priority number one.
there has been progress, and there has been failure.
but where we have fallen short,
I see not a problem,
I see an opportunity.
an opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past while laying a foundation for the future.
this takes...
not only new ideas...
but perseverance.
this takes not only resources, but courage.
this takes...
not only government, but families.
I've laid out a...
I've laid out a ten-point plan that...
I can't do this.
if there is a war on drugs, then many of our family members are the enemy.
and I don't know how you wage war on your own family.
[Reporters Clamoring]
national Airport, please.
Hey, Arnie, it's Saturday. You're working too hard, my friend.
Carl, I'm running late. I'm coming right over.
no, no, no, don't bother, Arnie. Let me ask you something.
when were you gonna tell me about the $3 million we got in from San Francisco two days after I was arrested?
um... I was waiting for the right time.
Oh. You didn't think you could trust my wife with that information?
I didn't want to risk it.
that could have been frozen along with everything else.
you had it all figured out, didn't you?
you were gonna move into my house, raise my kids, sleep in my bed...
with my wife.
sounds like a nice plan.
Oh, is it insane?
just think about it, okay? If I was gonna rip you off, why wouldn't I just leave town after Ruiz was killed?
why would I sit next to you in court and listen to a dismissal?
let me ask you something. You think there's a difference between a reason and an xcuse?
cause I don't.
good-bye, Arnie. - Carl...
Carl?
come on, sweetheart.
come outside. Everyone's waiting for you.
who was that? - Arnie. He's, uh...
he can't make it to the barbecue. - Oh.
come on. - Hi, Helena.
[Carl] Hello. - It's a great party.
who is he, a friend of yours? - Oh, I'm a nobody.
I'm the nobody who arrested you.
you're... - [Laughs] How you doing?
what are you doing in my house? - Oh, just looking around.
you got nice shit. Drug money buys a lot of nice shit, Carl.
listen, you don't want to talk that way in my house.
you're fucking a murderer, Carl.
fuck you and fuck your wife. - Hey, you can't be in here.
[Helena] Get him out. - You put me out, Carl.
I'm a cop. - I don't care.
[Helena] Get out. - Hey! Hey, hey!
is that what you wanted? - A nice little bedtime story, Helena.
tell him how you murdered my partner!
you got the wrong... - His name was Ray Castro, Helena!
ray Castro! You remember that!
what's his problem? - The carpet, sweetheart.
no, no, no, I got it. - I got it.
where did he come from? - Outside, honey.
what do you want to do, man?
[Caroline's Voice] On the good days, I feel like I get it.
like it all makes sense.
I can stay in the moment.
I don't have to control everything in the future...
and I believe everything is gonna work out fine.
o-on the bad days,
I just want to grab the phone and start dialing numbers.
I want to pull my hair...
and run through the streets screaming.
but thanks to the people I've met in these rooms, like Margaret and Jim...
and Sarah, um...
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna make it through today.
would you like to share?
uh... [Clears Throat] My name is Robert.
my wife Barbara and I...
are here to support our daughter, Caroline, and we're hear to listen.
we were once a peaceful race of intelligent mechanical beings.
but then came the war.
between the autobots who fought for freedom, and the decepticons who dreamt of tyranny.
over matched, and out numbered.
our defeat was all but certain.
but in the wars final days.
one autobot ship escaped the battle.
it was carrying a secret cargo.
which would have changed our planets fate.
a desperate mission.
our final hope.
a hope, that vanished.

Hello, Neil, Buzz.
I'm talking to you by telephone from the oval room at the White House.
and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.
I just can't tell you how proud we all are.
for every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives.
because of what you have done
we have splashed down.
the heavens has become a part of man's world.
for one priceless moment.
in all of history of man.
all the people on this earth are truly one.
along with their pride in which you have done.
you've inspired us to redouble our efforts, to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.
my hero, needs to wake up.
what is that?
this is your new lucky bunny.
Yeah, it's a beautiful thought, Carly.
but I don't think it's the whole, uh, bunny that's lucky.
you see it's just this section here.
you see it's just the rabbit's foot that's lucky.
all right, it's just a good luck charm.
hmm, help you think positive.
today's important.
come on, get up.
Hey, wear that nice tie. - Yeah.
you need any money for lunch?
no, I don't need any money for lunch.
I have money from yesterday's lunch.
you love it, don't you.
I'm just your American boy-toy.
a lover boy-toy.
you how demoralizing it is to save the world twice, to be groveling for a job.
they don't know you saved the world, Sam.
I mean I do, I believe you.
if everyone knows, I could get a job right here in D. C.
I mean I should be working with the autobots.
otherwise, it's not fair.
come on, they paid for your college.
the president gave you a hero medal.
thank you, man. Great job.
Wow. - And as I recall that wasn't even the highlight of your day.
Mr. Ambassador, here. - British embassy you're up next.
it's not really. I couldn't even if I wanted to. - Leave it there.

Oh yeah, my medal.
you know who gave that to me?
who?
POTUS. - Oh.
the president of the United States.
Hey, it's hard for everybody to get a job.
I don't have time. You see my parents are going to be here in a week.
from their road-trip party world tour.
my dad gets here, and I don't have a job.
he's gonna spank me you know. It's go time for me.
all right, tonight I'll give you a job.

maybe get that banish.
Ohh - Good looking. - Get out of here.
wait, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, he's gross.

...for them, you know. - Yesterday that one was in my underwear drawer.
good reason, it looked real good too.
what are you hitting, huh? - I want a normal boyfriend.
that's what you love about me, isn't it. - Heh, what a crying baby.
you know I don't have the word yet.
maybe a little bit closer when you can pay your half of the rent.
Bye.
Frinking shorting my circuits out here.
it's inhumane, what it is.
make us live in a box on a balcony.
right next to a beast.
like a common animal. - Stop, okay.
you and your creepy sidekick, you can't be in here without permission.
according to who, Miss blondy-blonde?
get out little doggie.
Hah!
yo brain's what's up?

you know Sam, I don't know about moving in with this chick.
uh, what if she dumps us like the last girl?
what she was mean, didn't like her.
us guys got to stick together.
no, we're not family. You're a political refuge.
and I have finally found someone who appreciates me for me.
well you tell her that we're not your pets.
and we're not your toys.
all right, we're an advanced genius alien race, ...just looking for a home.
we could leave it right here. - Didn't think we should stop.
come on what are they going to do, tow it?
where is he?
Sammy!
Oh, come on now Sammy, ha, ha. - Sam.
I miss you guys so much.
sure you did, what do you think?
look at that. - Cute.
stop it. - Wait until you see the end.
Oh I love your little tie. Hey, where's my girl?
she's got a new job. - Right.
I thought you were going to be here in a week.

Oh, are we keeping you from something?
like say, your job.
you had us worried.
uh, I have, uh, job interviews.
Oh, that's good.
well that sucks. - Stop it.
you don't have to be so negative Dad, you know.
you're in DC, you're here with your son, your family.
good things to do here too, right? - Yeah.
right, museums and monuments, okay.
I'll see you tonight. - I'm bagging the kid.
Sam, I think for an interview you should wear real pants.
I think in life you should wear real pants.
Oh, wha...what happened to Bumble Bee?
he's off on his missions, I had to get this as a back-up.
Oh, your car has a job, huh?
what does it change into?
it doesn't change into anything.
it's a collectors item, I got if for a steal.
it just needs some work, trust me.
Oh, I think it's darling. It reminds me a lot of Bumble Bee.

the Facility's name is, Chernobyl.
Mr. Voshkod.
uninhabited since '86.
I hear it won't be livable again for another 20, 000 years.
at least. The Ukraine was the most fertile land, it's a tragedy.

Where's your protective gear?

cause when I look at you.
I see a younger me.
classified Nest Headquarters - Washington, D. C.
all running Autobots in tar, training in 15 minutes.
Dino report to bay 23.
sideswipe bay 37 for weapons assessment.
senator, I suggest you remember that when the NASA ...wants funding they call me.
when the CIA is going to take out a target.
they ask first for my permission.
when the President wants to know which members of Congress are politically vulnerable.
in terms of oh, let's say undiscovered criminal conduct.
I'm on their memory dials.
usa agency say they have been monitoring the blast.
but in fact this was a covert military strike.
no nation has yet claimed ownership. - The CIA is up my ass about this mystery...
.raid in the middle east. So it's time to come clean was the unit involved.
uh, I'm not sure, Ma'am.
all right guys, this is how you do a decepticon...
...head kill shot.
as director of national intelligence
I'm a really big fan of intelligent answers.
I...I can't really tell you definitively.
these Autobots are like teenage kids.
they like to sneak out of the house once in a while.
Colonel Lennox, are you in command...
...or are you not? - Yes, Ma'am. I am...
stop with the Ma'am, enough with the Ma'am.
do I look like a Ma'am?
no, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, yes.
this one is a perfect invention I have made. - Right.
Oh, good they're here.
my names' Que. I do hope you have answers for him.
I've never seen him so upset. - Optimus, you remember Charlotte Mearing?
our Director of National Intelligence.
he's in a bad mood.
he's a not want to talk-a to anybody today.
what is this?
the silent treatment?
we've seen that, and this is not that.
this is worse.
prime, make something of yourself.
he's pissed.
you lied to us.
everything humans' know of our planet we were told had all been shared.
so why was this found in human possession?
we were in the dark on this also.
it was director only clearance at Sector 7, until now.
the bag. - Which bag?
air Ms. Berkin, green ostrich.
Oh my god.
this is a secret few men knew.
and fewer still remain alive.
allow me to please introduce to you, two of NASA's founding mission directors.
and astronaut, Dr. Buzz Aldrin.
one of the first two men to step foot on the moon.
sir.
Optimus Prime.
from a fellow space traveler.
it's a true honor.
the honor is mine.
our entire space race of the 1960's...
...it appears was in response to an event.
our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship.
no survivors on board.
we were sworn to secrecy by our commander in chief.
this was a mission you will never speak of.
I understand, sir.
a total of 35 people knew the real plan at NASA.
Soviets managed to land unmanned probes.
somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod.
we believe the Russians deduced that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly.
believed they had it mastered and harnessed it at Chernobyl.
we went on six missions in all.
we took hundreds of photos and samples.
we locked them away forever.
and the moon program was shut down.
where did you search the crash hold?
the ships name was the ARK.
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.
it was carrying an Autobot technology which would have won us the war.
and its captain.
who was this captain? - The Great Sentinel Prime.
the technology's inventor.
he was commander of the Autobots.
before me.
it's imperative that I find it before the Decepticons learn of its location.
our Autobot space craft has the ability to get there.
and, you must pray it's in time.
Hi, I'm here to see Carly Spenser.
you got the job?
this is crazy. - You really got it?

but now the restorations are back on track.
I'm going to pebble beach this year, going to need a trophy for that stand right there.

I'm totally fine, I get it. I'm well fed.
guess what, I'm not your boy toy anymore. I got my big boy pants on now.
you see them?
in the car, thank you Duchess.
Oh, my god, are you threatened by him?
threatened, what am I threatened by? His money, his power, his good looks?
none of the above, check!
your temper tantrums are so sexy.
get in the car, please.
Sam, he's hardly the first man to ever smile at me.
I think I can handle it.
hold on, hold on. It's.it's the smiling back part that gets me.
okay. - No more smiles.
never again, I promise.
you see, that works for me.
easy, easy.
you're not going to get it started that way.

come here.
come here!
come on...Sam.
what is your deal, huh?
I know your black ops stuff is important.
you know I'm not trying to diminish it, or guilt trip you, or anything.
but I just never see you anymore.
you can't come to the garage and stay on one night?
Sam, that makes me feel bad.
Yeah, well I hope you feel bad, you should feel bad.
look at the jalopy I'm driving now.
I feel bad every single day.
yo let's go, both of you.
Lennox want's to see you.
what, we're not good enough for you anymore.
sorry babe, they were very rude, right.
and you're fixing my car.
you don't think so?
raise your hand if you had a flying psycho ninja copier try to kill you today.
those are my brass knuckles.
that's my anklet do I have to take that off too?
and my toe rings?
all exhibitions clear the floor. We have ten minutes until attempted contact.
we've taken possession of the five devices that were hidden in the ship.
of Sentinel Prime.
they're some kind of prototype Autobot technology.
they say Sentinel was the Einstein of his civilization.
so we're going to keep these locked up, ...until we know what we're dealing with.
right now no one gets access.
no one. - This morning a guy recognized me.
he told me to warn you, he's talking about the Dark side of the moon.
then they killed him. - Wait a minute, you mentioned the moon?
Yeah, dark side of the moon.
but why would the decepticons want to kill humans?
I thought their war was with the Autobots.
and that is when he made his quick book town report. That's what I want.
who's the chick, okay.
excuse me, Colonel Lennox.
director Mearing
this is Sam Witwicky.
a civilian c. - I know his name, Colonel.
I want to know who gave him clearance.
who gave me Clearance? How about Optimus Prime.
when he touched down in suburbia looking for my house.
this is the national intelligence director.
in case you.
Hi. - Disrespecting a federal officer.
that ought to get you somewhere, who's she?
she's my girlfriend.
what is this like a date?
she knows all about the Autobots, okay.
she knows Bumblebee, and comes from a military family.
I can vouch for her.
Hey, I have an idea.
how about we get back to the important topics?
like the fact I almost had my face cut off by a Decepticon.
as a tax payer I can lodge a complaint.
as a matter of fact. - Okay, listen.
one of the software engineers at Sams office was murdered today.
he was involved in NASA's Lunar mapping probe.
here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.
we cannot entrust national security to teenagers.
unless I missed the policy paper.
are we doing that now?
no, good.
I don't care who you are.
if you breathe a word of what you've seen here.
you will do time for treason.
do you understand me?
I'll take my orders from the Autobots. I know them, I don't know you.
you will.
sentinel Prime.
he seems to run on Energon, and he's out of it.
he's in a sort of a sleep mode.
let us begin.
it's the great matrix of leadership.
he holds the only thing in the universe that can repower a Transformers spark.
this is incredible.
sentinel Prime.
we bid you return.
revenge.
no. - Just fire at.
no, Sentinel.
it is I, Optimus Prime.
it is all right.
you are safe.
there's nothing to fear.
we are here.
you are home, Sentinel.
the war?
the war!
the war was lost.
Cybertron is now but a barren wasteland.
we have taken refuge here on Planet Earth.
its human race is our allies.
my ship?
we came under fire.
the pillars.
where are the pillars?
you saved five of them.
including the control pillar.
only five?
we once had hundreds.
excuse me, gentlemen. May I ask, what is this technology you're looking for?
it is the ability to reshape the universe.
together the pillars form a space bridge.
I designed and I alone can control it.
it defied your laws of physics to transport matter through time and space.
you're talking about a teleportation device, aren't you?
Yes, for resources, for refuges.
refuges or troops of soldiers.
weapons, maybe bombs.
a means of an instant strike, that's its military function, isn't it?
it is our technology.
and it must be returned.
Yes, if humans say so.
you can't just bring weapons of mass destruction into our atmosphere.
kind of have to declare customs first.
a little formality called paperwork.
kinda separates us from the animals.
I will overlook your condescending tone.
you heave the gravity of mine.
the decepticons must never know the space bridge is here.
for in their hands...
...it would mean the end of your world.
total my mear file.
so the investigation is open.
we sent agents to your office.
and for the time being, we're going to send you home with Autobot protection.
Wh.who do I need to speak to, to get you guys to understand I can help.
I can contribute.
hey we can all help you tell me what you know, I can tell you all the fun planets I've been.
get off my desk, please.
Aw, you pulling out guns. Okay, can't help you on that.
what do you envision with me? I go back home now, I make copies?
this is a unit for veteran intelligence officers and special forces.
not for boys who once owned special cars.
that's a bit harsh, isn't it ma'am?
don't call me ma'am, I'm not a ma'am.
but you're a woman, aren't you?
Sooo.
are those yours?
Yeah, CIA.
I only ask because I also have a medal.
from the President.
Yeah.
great, so it's not that complicated, right?
no one gets to work with the Autobots unless I approve it.
you're breaking my chain of command.
come on, let's go.
you've done what you can for them.
with all due respect, young man.
I appreciate what you did.
but you're not a soldier.
you're a messenger, you've always been a messenger.
he's a hero.
B, you take the freight elevator, I'll see you up there.
Ah, this blows.
that lady officially kicked us out. - Yeah.
witness protection program sucks.
Yeah, but we're a whole lot safer with big yellow and his cannons.
that dog can't protect crap.
B.
you couldn't sleep.
Yeah, me too.
I don't believe she called me a messenger.
do you believe that? After everything I've done, I'm a messenger.
Oh I believe it. I tell ya Sammy we feel the same way.
the disrespect on this rock is criminal.
we should do something about it.
B.
I need to know why they're killing humans.
what say we call in the expert?
my next guest, is a former American intelligence operative.
who has dared to speak out.
regarding our alleged military alliance, .which what many describe, as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries.
he is the author of the best selling book, ..."Code-Name Hero."
for our special agent, Seymour Simmons.
bill, big fan. Great to be here.
that is what you would have us to believe.
it is in our best interest to formally take sides.
in this so called, alien civil war?
well, the other side wanted to spank us for breakfast, so.
I wouldn't exactly want to call it a toss up.
these decepticons are lethal.
but polls show half the world would feel safer with the Autobots completely gone.
get them out of here.
we don't need them here.
I feel safer when I sleep with a hand grenade.
it doesn't mean I'm always right.
thank you. Here's a fact, we obtained documents.
that shows you were fired by the intelligence committee.
down sized Bill, budget cuts.
get, out. - It says before, Severe delusional, - ...tendencies. - This is ambush journalism.
you want the truth about the alien alliance?
buy my book.
buy my book!
before it's to late, people.
you want a piece of me Bill, you want me to get naked?
I'm ready, interview is over. - You sound like a pin-head agent.
and I got a suggestion for you. - get out of my house, it is over, understand?
damage control.
Dutch! - You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons.
you have 23 seconds to leave the property.
I have called the police.
you are peasant people throwing rocks at a giant.
what's up next, what have we got?
book signing midtown at noon, then your pic reality show for discovery HM.
Oh and I had this, um...um.
the Vicky who keeps calling me five times today.
the kid, what does he want?
I called because the decepticons are back and I want to know why, and I need your help.
they're back?
well, that's good for business.
what if I told you I know a 50 year old alien secret that nobody ever told you?
do not tempt my addiction.
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.
Dutch, is this line secure?
no.
don't take the risk.
I'm rich, why should I?
do not relapse, I won't.
do not let the demons win.
got.
what kind of...secret?
apollo, moon, aliens, cover-up...
...future tech, assassinations, that kind of stuff.
Oh, Apollo.
Dutch!
tell Megatron, let's tango.
so majestic and peaceful, this planet.
unlike the final days of Cybertron.
I've wondered what might have been.
if you had fought the final battle.
instead of me.
never morn the past, young warrior.
thanks to you, our race survives.
you were our leader, Sentinel.
it is your right, to lead us again.
in a world I do not know.
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus.
you are mine.
we've got to break this case down.
what we have here is an astronaut epidemic.
M. I.A. dead, died in a car accident, killed, D. O.A. car death.
it's like these guys can't die. They can fly into outer space.
but they can't drive a car.
procured your information, Witwicky.
thank you, Bruce.
Noo.
you let me see one of them, one time.
quick. - Very.
here's their reconnaissance order.
it say's NASA launched in 2009.
see, forensics show Wang may have messed with the code.
preventing it from mapping the far side of the moon.
which is also the Dark side.
freaking awesome.
painful trade us, intimidate us.
...coerce us to do their dirty work.
and once they're done?
Dushhhh.
the double tap cerebellum.
so he was working for the Decepticons.
I don't think this is about the Decepticons.
they're looking for something on the moon.
I think it's about something...
...they wanted to hide.
come to daddy.
come on, fall down.
did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?
hah, like it.
I'll teach you...
sir.
having a pretty high level alien Intel confab here.
that I don't think you're cleared for.
errand boy. - Yeah, you're right.
it's a bitchin' robot. - At least have a go, sir.
thank you so much for this.
better go, Bruce.
Hey, I'm smokin' over here.
now with the missing Russian cosmonauts.
turns out the soviets cancelled a manned mission to the moon.
the moon, in 1972.
when 200 cosmonauts went into hiding in America.
and I just found them, aaaah.
you're a genuis, Brains.
Oh that was smooth, Bumble Bee.
missed it by that much.
Hi.
would somebody tell me what the hell's going on?
who are you?
who are you? - Who am I?
who is that? Dutch, frisk her.
certainly. - Here, no.
Dutch, um...
don't touch me.
I'm not going to... - Sam?
angel.
uh, I was working.
I'm sorry about this.
great, we're homeless.
she lives here?
Wow!
you had your chance to frisk her.
I have a girl friend.
really, what's her name?
Innn...dia.
I do remember, but you know, my friends, ...they need me. I have to be here right now.
and what, the Autobots and the military they can't handle this on their own.
you know what I liked about your war stories, Sam?
it's that they were stories.
they were in the past.
look, I know you're thinking about your brother.
okay, and you're thinking about your family.
and it's not that situation.
no? - No.
why not?
why isn't it, Sam?
you think we'd rather has his medals, or we'd rather have him?
I hear you, I get it.
where are you taking my bunny, stop.
just stop for a second.
you think I could sleep last night?
I mean it hit me. No, Sam want's the big danger.
he doesn't know who he is without it.
I just wanna matter.
you matter to me.
I know you're worried, I know you're worried.
but I promise you I can, I can handle this.
can you, you can promise it?
I promise.
Sam, I don't want to loose you, and I know where this leads.
I'm not ready for this.
are you coming with me?
I can't.
okay.
Hey.
here's your foot.
a warrior's path is a solitary one.
how the hell does she afford that car?
her boss. - Rich bastards.
I used to hate them.
but now it's...
going to a gang on a hunt for two Russian Cosmonauts.
nothing like driving in a Maybach, huh?
Germans know how to make cars, let me tell ya.
my Dutch man. Former NSA, Cyber sleuth extraordinaire.
tracked them down, here.
so these cosmonauts wanted to hide. Why?
bingo, I got a match.
you're a German Shepard, Dutch.
the thing about Russians is...
...they never like to talk.
it's going to take a little of the international language.
dos vedanya. - That means goodbye.
who's to get revolution.
a famous, I have no idea.
Dutch.
give me something tough.
Baryshnikov. - We do speak English.
Dutch, you suck.
it's a Cyrillic, alphabet.
it's like all the buttons you never push on a calculator.
I don't suck.
agent Seymour Simmons, CETI. Formerly Seta.
we know who you are.
cosmonaut chicks.
so what?
you were suppose to travel to the Dark side of the moon, then...
it all got shut down.
the question is.
Why?
can my child smoke in here?
okay, all right. Okay!
Yeah, shoot me. - Who was this delish, huh?
I'm only the driver in my country are you?
you are beautiful.
has anyone told you, you're beautiful?
cause she's a beautiful woman.
whoa, hey!
Dutch, back in the cage.
control your boy, please control your boy.
Dutch, stop!
I'm so sorry. That is the old me.
okay, let's everybody just calm down.
let's lower the heat, lower the guns. Just relax.
world War 2 is over.
you're about to see one of the biggest soviet secrets.
america first to send men to the moon.
but U. S.S. R. first to send camera.
in 1969 our Lunar 3.
take picture of the Dark, the shadow side.
see's nothing.
but in 1963 Lunar 4 sees. - ... strange rocks.
Yeah. - Around the ship.
hundreds of them.
here, show picture.
with some, drag marks.
I've seen these, these aren't rocks.
these are pillars.
alien pillars for a space bridge.
we know about them because the Autobots have five of these.
the decepticons must have raided the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there.
took the pillars and hid them.
well that doesn't make sense. The Decepticons have the ship.
they have all those pillars. Why would they leave several...
... of these if he's the only one that can use them?
unless...
he's the one thing they still need.
we got to meet up with Sentinel.
rendezvous with him, and keep him safe.
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel, Optimus is10 minutes behind.
we're coming in fast, now.
Mr. Witwicky I thought I made it clear to you, that I did not want you calling this phone.
listen, the whole thing has been a set up since the beginning.
Decepticons wanted Optimus to find Sentinel, because only Optimus could revive him.
but we have the space bridge.
Mearing, you have five pillars.
I just learned that they have hundreds.
you're doing exactly what they wanted you to do.
what do I need to say to you.
the Decepticons are coming for Sentinel Prime.
we're going to NEST.
we have an Energon alert.
energon reading detected on ...
currently tracking.
three black suburban.
B, you gotta get Sentinel out of here, you got to floor it.
Oh man, oh I'm fine.
watch out, watch out.
gotcha.
shoot him, shoot him!
shoot him, B.
B, you gotta move. Faster, faster B, go!
wipeout.
come on, back to NEST.
Dino, I got him.
is there a problem?
whoa, little Mexican stand-off we got here.
weapons down.
and we'll let you escape with your dignity.
drop them.
that's good.
ironhide, watch out.
ironhide, catch.
behind you.
Decepticon punk.
class dismissed.
inside, let's go. - Move.
quick, move it.
Lennox. - Go, go, go, go.
we got decepticons everywhere.
I got my whole team deployed looking for them.
Ironhide!
protect Sentinel, get him locked up inside.
consider it done.
you gotta guard him, because he's the key to the whole thing.
indeed I am.
what you must realized, my Autobot brothers.
is we were never going to win the war.
for the sake of our planets survival.
a deal had to be made.
with Megatron.
get back!
what have you done?
I hereby discharge you from duty.
B! - Get back.
bring all the NEST forces back to the base.
come on, move.
get them in, get them here. We don't have enough men.
do not engage Sentinel.
just go to the back gate.
director, down.
let's slide, let's slide
go, follow me.
start firing.
wait don't. - Get out.
Hey, Sentinel.
what is going on?
what do you think you're doing?
I am a Prime.
I do not take orders from you.
director Mearing come on. We can't fight him, let's go.
we have to go. - Now.
return what belongs to me.
Oh, my god.
everybody out, everybody out.
everybody stay calm.
yeah take a look, Optimus.
this is all on you.
the Sentinel hit the vault.
took the pillars.
come on, let's go.
all right, notify the 101st airborne.
we need to hunt this thing down.
Carly.
hot for a little camp fire.
Smores. - Aw.
isn't this great, we are really living off the land.
ma, Dad. Have you guys seen Carly come home yet?
excuse me, can you knock please.
this is our bedroom.
why wouldn't she be at home?
we had a fight, and...
we might have broken up, or be on a break. I don't really know.
What!?. Noo. - Look, I can't talk about it.
you gotta be kidding me. - I can't go into details now, Mom. I have to find her.
Sam, we're having a family meeting.
family meeting.
you may not know this. But your father and I were not always this perfectly happy.
you know there was a time in our marriage when I thought, "This is not going to work out.
can you please hurry up. - I'm just hope you ...
. just understand that you... - She's damaging me.
...break up with one world class high.
no, stop, stop, okay. - Yeah.
she dumped me, I moved to something better.
that's it, I'm a happier person. - It's not going to be as beautiful...
lose her, why did you lose her? - Help me.
they had an argument. - We had a fight.
okay, but you're not going to get a third one.
I mean unless you have like a big...
just don't want to talk. - You need a book.
you'll always wrong. - Hey, - Get used to it. -Okay, this you gotta read this.
she comes first, there's some killer...
...shit in here. - No, No, No.
Ah, lets get this. - No, no.
no, no. - Sit down. Sit down!
back me up.
happy wife, happy life.
Yeah. - unhappy wife
stone cold misery for the rest of your...
stop. - It's true.
all I'm saying is.
do you love this girl?
she's the one.
then you gotta go get her.
I mean, your dad and I, when we had troubles.
he moved heaven and earth to find me.
would he, say what you said.
say it.
I would follow you to the end of time.
does that suck or what? - No.
bad syfy dope.
I want you guys to get as far away from here as you can.
you understand?
I love you.
Oh, my master.
such a brilliant scheme.
so, when Sentinel left Cybertron, ...it was to defect.
he was meant to rendezvous with me here on Earth, before fate waylaid us both.
the only way to revive him, ...we needed Prime and his matrix.
excellent strategy.
so he is now your partner, master.
he is my greatest triumph.
so impressive.
commencing transport.
stop! No, no, no Sentinel!
forgive me.
here we are.
fight us now.
Autobots, retreat.
why Sentinel, why?
for Cybertron.
for our home.
what war destroyed, we can rebuild.
but only if we join with the Decepticons.
no, it's not the only way.
this is our home.
we must defend the humans.
so lost you are, Optimus.
on Cybertron we were Gods.
and here they call us machines.
let the humans serve us.
or perish.
you're lucky I didn't kill you.
in time, you'll see.
it's not over.
and if I were him, ...I wouldn't let you out of my sight for one second.
it's funny I was just thinking on the way over here,
I really could use some advice from Dylan.
and there he is. Can I speak to you? - Welcome.
please sit down, have a drink.
you know what, I don't need a drink.
or a car, or a job.
I just need to speak to my girlfriend alone.
is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?
excuse me.
what's going on? - I'll tell you outside.
I really think I can help you, Sam.
I remember a talk I had with my dad once, about tough choices.
now's not the time, I'll set something up, though.
course that was way back when my dad's firm was in charge of budget review and accounting for NASA.
you see the thing that he taught me was...
when it's not your war, you join the side that's going to win.
to direct, or was it just me?
certainly not you, sir.
you're mine.
Noooo!
get help. Someone get help. - Sam, I cant get out.
goodnight - Goodnight Mr. Dylan.
Sam, get me out of here.
help.
get help.
he's young, live and learn.
get me out. - Goodnight.
this was a fun night.
you really think you're the first man ever asked to join a noble alien cause?
who are you?
you know why we've not been back to the moon since 1972?
because these two?
they came to my dad and they told him to do some creative accounting.
make it way to expensive to ever go back.
so he and others, shut down the American and Russian space programs.
and they've been our clients ever since.
you helped to kill people?
you think they give you a choice?
besides, it's not like I personally participated.
I am a liaison.
I liaise.
it's hostile takeover time, Sam.
Sam!
let her go.
Sam.
I've had my eye on you for years, Sam.
you're the one spy I've never been able to provide as the one close to the Autobots.
Sam, don't do what he wants.
yes he will.
they all do.
they all say, murder. You understand me.
the time it takes you to blink, they will do it to her, and they will do it to me.
so you show a little respect.
when someone offers you a job.
wrist.
you are to track down, Optimus Prime.
because you're the one human he trusts.
you will ask one question.
how does he intend to fight back?
strategies, tactics, everything.
has a nasty little bite, doesn't it.
it's very high tech.
it lets us see what you see, hear what you hear.
and it attacks your nervous system.
so if you so much as try and signal.
I know what to tell you, Sam.
relationships have consequences.
I am here because my father, she is here because of you.
stop! Stop, stop...stop.
Soundwave, if you please.
Sam.
do your job.
she'll be safe. I give you my word.
I'll kill you.
you have my word.
combatant commands are now at Defcom 1.
approximately 200 Decepticons are in hiding.
energon detectors have been triggered as far away as South America and China.
the U. N. just received an encrypted audio file.
they say it's from the leaders of the Autobots.
defenders of Earth.
we have come for your natural resources.
to rebuild our damaged planet.
when we have transported all we needed.
we will leave your world in peace.
for such peace to exist.
you must immediately exile the Autobot rebels you have harbored.
non negotiable.
renounce the rebels.
we await your reply.
we'll debrief you in transit.
yeah I really don't see how I can be of any help.
I mean you guys seem pretty busy.
we can just do this another time, I think.
I have underestimated you at every turn.
You.ha...what?
you warned us that they were using humans.
and you knew that Sentinel was the key.
director.
Oh, who am I? Hey, you're the expert.
I'm just a walking security leak.
are you all right?
Yes.
no you're not, you're sweating. - No, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm sweating because I'm nervous.
I'm nervous because you got me in here for this information, okay.
I'm a twitter junkie, I blog everything, I can't keep secrets.
Oh you wouldn't dare. - That's the truth, I'm telling you.
you wouldn't dare. - Director I got a call for you at 15.
what are you doing?
nothing, what are you doing?
get away from me.
it's been a remarkable series of events today at the Capitol.
just moments ago legislation was passed to exile the Autobots from American shores.
the U. S. military alliance with them is officially over.
the words of the house and the... - Yeah.
.authority leaders responds to today's resolution.
what? - We cannot in good conscious invite...
they can't do this, you gotta tell them they can't do that.
okay, it's official, it's a go people!
these are our allies. The Autobot's fought for us, they fought with us.
and where are we now?
facing an enemy invasion.
with an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more.
if there's more you know?
anything at all about the enemies intentions.
now's the time to tell.
Autobots have no way of leaving this planet.
that is where you're wrong.
it's name is the Xanthium.
it bought the second wave of Autobots.
and it's been under NASA's care and study ever since.
we've linked it with a decommissioned shuttle, to maintain military control until they're gone.
gonna be 10, 000 pounds of torque on that on this cheaper Cheep-oh, not my thing.
you damage this delays all me mates.
that's your wreckers.
they take care of the Xanthium.
we don't let them off the base much, because they're assholes.
you gotta pull that you Nancy wanker.
it's torqued to kill them.
calm down.
Epps. - You are ridiculous, that's you.
Hello, man.
I'm retired from the air force.
can you let my hand go?
what the hell was that?
I went on to just consult and run interference for them.
no more combat or alien shooting at my ass.
I got a dream job.
keeping the Autobots here.
do you believe this is happening?
where do you think is taking them?
any planet but here.
I want to talk to whoever's in charge here.
well, well, well.
Charlotte Mearing.
agent Simmons
former Agent Simmons, so.
I see you survived Washington.
washington, Egypt, heartbreak.
I survived, I will survive.
they're bringing everybody in, kid.
putting all the Intel on the table.
and if you think that putting 9 Autobots, is going to solve a damn thing.
it's out of my hands.
moving up in the world, huh?
your booty looks excellent.
you ever say word to anyone about what happened that night in Quantico.
I'll cut your heart out.
you already did.
Sammy, listen to me.
don't let them exile us. - Don't let them take us, Sam.
it's a decepticon trap.
checked the nitrogen, we're booking out o' here.
Optimus.
what your leaders say is true.
this was all my fault.
I told them whom to trust.
I was so wrong.
it doesn't make your fault, it makes you human for a change.
remember this.
you may loose your faith in us.
but never in yourselves.
I need to know how you're going to fight back.
I know there's a strategy.
I know you're coming back with reinforcements.
something, I know there's a plan.
you can tell me, no other human will ever know.
there is no plan.
we just do what they want, how are we going to live with ourselves?
you are my friend, Sam.
you always will be.
but your leaders have spoken.
from here.
the fight will be your own.
make it short.
we're loading up.
all right, hustle up!
when we do whatever we can.
make it like a bow.
you will always be, my friend.
Sam.
I gotta be going on.
years from now, they're gonna ask us.
where were you when the took over the planet?
we're gonna say.
we just stood by and watched.
you should really look at this as a partnership.
you have to stand on the side of progress if you want to be a part of history.
go launch in.5...4...3.2
1...zero.
the word is, you got it. - I always get what I want, Sam.
we just needed to be sure.
sure of what?
that they would to without a fight.
say again? - Detecting a foreign object.
we all work for the Decepticons now.
Chicago, Illinois
I need your help to track a phone call.
it's a man on this phone, he's the head of the human operation.
and he's holding Carly hostage.
sit down, don't move.
I'm watching him drive up right now.
the call was placed in-route.
I'm hacking into the Phones camera right now.
there that's is, that's a live stream from the camera.
someplace, hold on I can triangulate this.
okay, it's Chicago cell site.
there, I got it. Trump tower, Chicago, lower penthouse.
we're on.
I'm going. - You're sure.
thanks a lot for trying to help me, I can be there in 15 hours.
you're not going alone.
still got my NEST friends out there.
we'll round them up, find your girlfriend and bring this guy in.
why are you helping me?
cause that asshole killed my friends, too.
they said they were here for our resources.
to rebuild their planet.
Yes, really one resource in particular.
one unique to our planet.
us.
you're very smart.
you see they can't rebuild without a slave labor force.
how many rocks up there in the universe offer 6 billion workers?
what are you talking about?
we can't transport people.
they're not shipping people.
they're shipping their planet here.
Oh, my God.
what's Sentinel doing here?
watch.
they're spreading 100's of pillars around the globe right now.
in just a few hours.
they're going to launch them into orbit.
and bring Cybertron into our atmosphere.
the red one there, controls the rest.
he triggers that, it starts the whole thing.
be gone insect operative, your work is done.
your Excellency. - You're such a dick.
you want this to happen? - I want to survive, I want 40 more years.
you think I asked for this?
I inherited a client.
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here and we're all their slaves.
I guess they'll still need a human leader.
get this straight, you want to survive you listen to me.
it is time for the slaves of earth to recognize their masters.
seal off the city.
get the dogs out of here now, get them in the back.
I guess they didn't tell you about this part, did they.
you think I'm at every meeting?
they promised here.
they said it was hell.
let's roll.
don't have a signal reading.
it's not working.
move back.
there's a ring of alien ships around Chicago.
our high range bombers were just knocked out of the sky.
they can't get through enemy air defenses over the city.
our satellites have been jammed. We have no way to monitor the enemies movement.
all NEST teams are on stand down.
only have troops at air force base, move out.
10 minutes from the battle zone.
we have special forces trying to gain access to the city.
an infantry is staging at the perimeter.
excuse me, excuse me, it just doesn't make sense.
can't we get any eyes in there at all?
they keep shooting down our drones.
they want us blind.
but we do have a couple of mini-drones we're gonna try.
well if we can man these UAV drones, .can we try to redirect them toward, Trump Tower?
the kid, Witwicky was on his way to Chicago.
set some point man human op is there.
before the Decepticons punks.
listen, if I know anything, I know this.
that kid is an alien bad news magnet.
my God.
we came here to find her in the middle of all that?
are we really going out there, Epps?
I'm not going in there.
no one's going in.
I am.
with or without you, I'll find her.
you're gonna get yourself killed, Sam.
is that what you want?
is that what you want.
you came all the way out here to get yourself killed.
huh? Listen, to me what I'm saying.
she's here because of me, do you understand?
listen, if you go in this build.
that's if she's even still alive.
there's no way you're going to be able to even reach her.
well what would you suggest I do.
it's over.
I'm sorry, but it's over.
no.
woah, incoming!
we will kill them all.
wreckers, kill him.
this is going hurt.
a lot.
your leaders will now understand.
Decepticons will never leave your planet alone.
and we needed them to believe we had gone.
for today, in the name of freedom.
we take the battle to them.
I saw your ship blow up.
the ship, we were never in the ship.
we designed the damn thing, didn't we.
we were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate.
splashed down back in the Atlantic, just as planned.
we ain't going no where.
Yeah, no ones exiling us.
the Autobots are staying right here.
we're going to help you win this war.
they're surrounding the city to make a fortress.
so that no one can see what they're up to inside.
our only chance is the element of surprise.
I think I know where to look.
mini-drones on approach, Trump Tower.
you're telling me, Sam's headed into that?
poor kid.
probably never got close.
your gonna fly this thing, right?
what does, what is that, what is that?
so, so.
so you so, so can fly.
that feels terrible.
we're right behind ya.
all right.
we're going in.
the city's secure.
the humans cannot stop us.
as the afternoon falls.
the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position.
this is the victory I promised you so many years ago.
I have gained to work with you.
that I planet may survive.
I will never work for you.
and you would be wise to remember the difference.
Oh, I'm so sick of this. I'm sick of waiting.
where is she?
where is she!?
you've got some balls.
no, Sam!
nooo!
Carly!
Carly!
jump.
B, fire.
help him, B.
Autobots, they're alive.
they're here, Autobots. - Decepticons defend the pillar.
release the bridges.
find them.
Sam.
you found me.
I'd find you anywhere.
... let's go, let's go.
well you're crazy.
here's design, is that us?
this thing is a military UAV drone.
check to see if it's still working.
Yeah, it's still got power.
flight control, do you copy?
can you rotate?
can you do something?
I think we got something.
epps, we got Epps.
...do something.
come man, work, work.
all right, turn the volume up on that.
it's him.
can you rotate, something.
Yes, yes.
okay, okay they can see us.
Chicago is ground zero, you understand?
you hear us, understand? - Jesus.
the Sentinel prime is here and he has components for his space bridge.
they're on top of a building on the Chicago river.
they're on the hotchess school investments.
the control pillar controls everything.
in the southeast cupola.
you gotta secure the pillar. You have to shoot down the pillar.
or they're going to transport Cybertron here, do you understand?
are you sure. - What?
give me the GPS on that building and on that drone.
let's go.
knights ready those co-ordinates.
shorten the kill chain.
guys on the tarmac, five minutes.
south east from here. - All right.
we need to move before the fighters spot us.
wait here until we scout a route ahead.
let's roll.
ratchet, cover high.
Hey, think you could use that rocket to shoot down the pillar?
we're eight blocks away.
we gotta get closer to take a shot.
not closer, higher.
we need clear line of sight.
and it's across the river.
gonna have a hell of a time trying to sneaking up.
we only got one shot.
one shot's all we need.
we gotta be able to see around that building from the ground.
get NSA to send service specs for any cameras in that area.
maybe some are working.
traffic lights, ATM's anything.
listen up.
you want to get back? We're going to have to wing-suit in.
it's the only way to get close.
I can't promise anyone a ride home, but if you're with me...
the world needs you now.
I'll find my own ride home, sir.
who else?
right here, sir.
general warn tower we're taking diversionary action to south of the city.
we're coming north and low.
you guys drop a ...
Autobot victory, Autobot victory.
gotta warn you. It's scary out there, Decepticons.
they got my trailer, I need that flight tech.
shockwave can't hunt all of us at once.
wreckers, we need a diversion.
let's get some - You got that right.
listen, we're going to circle around to that glass building.
we'll get high enough to make the rocket shot.
while you guys draw his fire, let's move.
wait a minute.
I'm not going letting you go out there without my urban-combat prototypes.
we gotta go, Que. Come on.
wait, they're great inventions for kicking ass.
what are these?
those are boom sticks.
armed in thirty seconds.
grapple gloves, for climbing.
move out, go on. - Move!
go, go, go.
move, move! Let's go.
Ah, ow, ow, ow.
let's go, come on.
Hey, where you going?

Aw, Shockwaves coming.
go for the stairs.
epps, this way.
breaking right, breaking right.

we're going to use Willis Tower for cover.
once we make altitude.
we jump.

for our brothers.
let's make this trip worth it.
Oh, oh God.
whoa, this building - Oh the building.
they're shooting at the building.
this is not a good idea. - What?
this is not a good idea, the building's in stasis.
just stop for a second. We don't do what we can do.
then it doesn't matter, we all die.
right? It's your time, come on man.
I'm incapable of collapse.
I'm having a heart attack anyway.
the building is going over.

Don't...move.

Hey, how do we get out of here.
Hey, come on.
Oh lord, just let me get out of this alive.
I'll give you annuities, and get it together.

we can run this way.
I give you one thing to do.
one thing to do and you drop the ball on that.
I never signed for all of this.
got aliens blasting me, running around chasing me.
I'm ducking in churches and buildings and all that kind of crap, maybe.
this is bullshit, I didn't sign up for this, Epps.
I'm trying to keep it down.
what a treat, you and me.
alone.
come on, come on. Let's run.
okay, he's after me not you.

Ow!

ow, ow, ow. I can't see, I can't see.
Sam, take my hand.

see that pocket over there.
I got it.

I'll kick you.

okay, he's going to run with the rest of the Autobots, meet us at the river.
all right.
he sucked me in, there was nothing I could do.
