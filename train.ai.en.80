okay, but if mostly... If hooking up is mostly oral sex...
okay, but if our egg misbehaves, can we beat it?
okay, but if she didn't want us to find her,

okay, but if you were here, you're a suspect. Come on, man. Middle of the shift, you're getting hungry.
okay, but if you would just give me one more chance,
okay, but if you're going to stay for a while, let me get you some tea.
okay, but if you're not in a hundred percent...
okay, but if you've got a problem with family guy, you'll have to wait in line.
okay, but if... If the fight wasn't about a sex scandal, then what was it?
okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing
okay, but in case you're interested, your husband was murdered.
okay, but in the meantime, assuming your theory is correct,
okay, but in the meantime, um,
okay, but in the meantime, um, I do have a teenage daughter,
okay, but in the meantime, um, I do have a teenage daughter, so if you could...

okay, but is there something you can give us...
okay, but isn't this the same table
okay, but it doesn't do us much good
okay, but it doesn't track.
okay, but it has to be small, all right?
okay, but it has to stay between us.
okay, but it is supposed to neutralize
okay, but it turns out that she might not be in there.
okay, but it was Stan, the fish.
okay, but it wasn't a sexual favor.
okay, but it wasn't from me.
okay, but it will just take a minute for things to... Settle down.
okay, but it's a fire stopper, not a fire starter.
okay, but it's a little light, no?
okay, but it's a little light, no? Does this add some weight?
okay, but it's a stretch.
okay, but it's gonna be fine.
okay, but it's gonna be lonely out there.
okay, but it's gonna be the same scrambled signal.
okay, but it's gonna hurt,
okay, but it's good, it's good.
okay, but it's my turn to row this thing.
okay, but it's not me.
okay, but it's not my fault if something happens to the mutt.
okay, but it's not okay to quit.
okay, but it's not okay to rip up toys when we're angry.
okay, but it's not really finished, so... Got it.
okay, but it's still my turn to pick the lock next time.
okay, but it's still the best. It's still the best.
okay, but it's still wall.
okay, but it's the head of the studio - I mean, your father.
okay, but it's their wedding day, so don't you think it's time you let it go?
okay, but it's very circumstantial, so I'm warning you, I don't want
okay, but just act surprised, okay?
okay, but just act surprised, okay? I don't want to get blamed for blowing it.
okay, but just because they're wrong does not mean my fault.
okay, but just call if you need anything, okay?
okay, but just don't fight
okay, but just in case you and the banker don't work out,
okay, but just know that that's okay, too.
okay, but just let me do the talking .- well, when don't I?
okay, but just like the principle of it... We need to.
okay, but just listen to me for one second.
okay, but just one for medicinal purposes.
okay, but just one more.
okay, but just one.
okay, but just one. I'm driving. Come on.
okay, but just so I can explain. Yeah.
okay, but just so you know, I'm massively stoned right now.
okay, but just so you know, he's kind of a big, angry maniac.
okay, but just this once.
okay, but just this once. Come on in.
okay, but just, let's just play this down, okay?
okay, but just, look, all right.
okay, but just, since you guys are so jazzed about him,
okay, but justso I can explain. Yeah.
okay, but keep it quiet. No noise.
okay, but keep it short and sweet.
okay, but keep me in the loop. Always.
okay, but keep that stuff in there about the bird flu. I'm serious.
okay, but l am freezing, so...
okay, but l am not singing.
okay, but l'm not leaving without my kitties.
okay, but lean back. Lean back and then I'll -
okay, but leave your bag. Why?
okay, but less is more.
okay, but let in the future is not "well."
okay, but let me just ask you is this gonna hurt.
okay, but let me just ask you is this gonna hurt.
okay, but let me pay the money.
okay, but let me talk to them first.
okay, but let's be fair. You can.
okay, but let's bring it back down to a man's voice.
okay, but let's just get back to the sunpass for a minute.
okay, but let's look into both.
okay, but let's not forget that, to even get to the hatch, we have to get past the farm,
okay, but let's not forget that,
okay, but let's pretend there's something and go from there. Who sees something on this m. R. I.?
okay, but let's talk outside.
okay, but let's wipe it down real good first.
okay, but lipstick's not enough. We'll have to find more.
okay, but lipstick's not enough.

okay, but listen, Chuck,
okay, but listen, I got to talk to you.
okay, but listen, the shrimp kinda tastes...
okay, but listen, when he comes in,
okay, but listen... No buts.

okay, but long story fucking crazy short...
okay, but look how you're standing.
okay, but look,
okay, but look, I still want to chip in on this renovation.
okay, but look, someone could come in.
okay, but look, we're colleagues now.
okay, but make it quick. Thank you.
okay, but make sure anyway.
okay, but make yourself useful.
okay, but maybe if we talk to him together...
okay, but maybe not.
okay, but maybe this isn't privileged information.
okay, but maybe we caught a break here.
okay, but mom's still here.
okay, but mom, mom, you cannot say anything.
okay, but money problems.
okay, but more to beat him with. Jesus, Tom, the two of us have faced worse odds.
okay, but move fast, move real fast.
okay, but move over. That's my side.
okay, but move over. That's my side.
okay, but my client returned the Bentley the day before yesterday.
okay, but my guess is this judge doesn't go for it.
okay, but my guy's in there facing a gun
okay, but my guys are in there facing a gun because this kid came after you,
okay, but my point is:
okay, but my teachers were all idiots.
okay, but my watch says it's 4:53.
okay, but next time we talk about you.
okay, but next time you get him.

okay, but nobody dies from a bloody nose.
okay, but none of them work for Leona Lansing.
okay, but not after 10:00.
okay, but not after 7.
okay, but not only to foreign bankers and foreign governments.
okay, but not today.
okay, but not you. Okay? Save every breath.
okay, but nothing we have on Brian Ford
okay, but now it's on you, too.
okay, but now see you're crying!
okay, but now this is what concerns me. Let's see, where is it?
okay, but now we have to dig.
okay, but now you're not getting one, so maybe someday...
okay, but oil gives us clean jobs.
okay, but on a scale from one to ten,
okay, but on the inside, I'm you. I'm a Peyton.
okay, but once this goes, anything still in there is never getting out.
okay, but one at a time!
okay, but one at a time!
okay, but only a drag.
okay, but only a half hour.
okay, but only a sec.
okay, but only because I was already going this way.
okay, but only because I've gotta go decimate a traffic cop on the stand.
okay, but only because it sounded like an order.

okay, but remember, that's just what the judges think.
okay, but remember, we're on a time limit.
okay, but remember, you can't reheat a shuffle.
okay, but remember... I know, no excessive force.
okay, but right after the operation,
okay, but right now,
okay, but right now, we have to do what she asked us to do.
okay, but see, the thing is,
okay, but seriously
okay, but seriously you don't think this is a weird question?
okay, but seriously you don't think this is a weird question?
okay, but she - no, no.
okay, but she must be back on the stage
okay, but she said... This will just take a second.
okay, but she's a good dancer.
okay, but she's acting really weird, and she's strapped with a nine.
okay, but she's claiming she loved him.
okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
okay, but she's not coping.
okay, but she's writing a story about our show,
okay, but showing up and acting like this?
okay, but since I'm not really talking to an infant...
okay, but since it's class time
okay, but since we were together for so long, it's not really that wrong.
okay, but since we were together for so long,
okay, but some people might not take kindly to gays moving out of the neighborhood.
okay, but sometimes when you don't eat, it's worse,
okay, but sometimes you ask me to wait
okay, but stand clear.
okay, but stay behind me.
okay, but stay behind me.
okay, but stay in bed. Drink fluids.
okay, but stay there. don't leave.
okay, but still wants to go out in the yard, get dirty,

okay, but still, I won an award!
okay, but still, I won an award!
okay, but still. You know.
okay, but strictly as an observer.
okay, but that could be anything, right?
okay, but that could make me look too frivolous and not intellectual enough.
okay, but that doesn't change the fact that I've told you everything I know.
okay, but that doesn't make her an addict.
okay, but that doesn't mean
okay, but that doesn't mean that the guy we're looking for is here.
okay, but that guy's been in jail for over a year,
okay, but that night, it seemed likeyou we celebrating something.
okay, but that still doesn't explain his blindness, though.
okay, but that still leaves 51%. That's the controlling interest.
okay, but that still leaves 51%. That's the controlling interest.
okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
okay, but that's just for right now, right?
okay, but that's not an option for me.
okay, but that's not going to happen -
okay, but that's not the issue. I mean, you can't libel the dead.
okay, but that's not the point anymore.
okay, but that's not up to you. I can't sleep at night.
