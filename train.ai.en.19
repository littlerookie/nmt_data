the stimuli through which you put these three principles into action have been described-the procedure begins with desire.
the stimulus added cash and momentum.
the stimulus allots$ 7 billion for states that agree to updated eligibility rules for unemployment benefits. But the state must first agree to calculate benefits using an "alternative base period" which takes into account the most recent wages earned.
the stimulus and accompanying easy credit fuelled construction, in turn driving up demand for energy-intense products such as steel, and so boosting heavy industry.
the stimulus bill is an obvious example, but we see this phenomenon all over the country.
the stimulus bill is itself a mishmash of mr obama's progressive priorities and short-term expedience.
the stimulus bill signed into law by president barack obama earlier this year contained$ 800 million in funding for the department of energy's biomass program, which will accelerate advanced biofuels research and development and provide funding for commercial-scale biorefinery projects.
the stimulus bill was structured as a refundable tax credit, which is anathema to republicans, but we compromised so that it could be passed.

the stimulus is also pouring$ 1 billion into desperately needed "comparative effectiveness research" that will help doctors and patients learn what kind of treatments actually work.
the stimulus is just a one-off boost-though a reprieve from credit-card payments might be helpful to monte-and commodity prices are likely to stay high.
the stimulus offered more than$ 4 billion in grants for states that made certain changes, such as lifting caps on the number of charter schools and devising new ways to evaluate teachers.
the stimulus package allows firms to convert the tax break into upfront payments.
the stimulus package as currently scripted would push the fiscal deficit for this year up to some$ 1.2 trillion, or over 8% of gnp.
the stimulus package of barack obama, us president, has offered money to states that make it easier for part-time and lower-wage workers to access unemployment benefits.

the stimulus packages of most countries in the oecd include large sums for smart power grids, digitisation of health records and the deployment of broadband networks.
the stimulus packages that have been announced across the region must try to turn its surfeit of savers into avid consumers.
the stimulus plan also had many other long-term costs, including inflation, soaring property prices that threatened to form a bubble, and a build-up of questionable loans at state banks.
the stimulus plan provides$ 3.5 billion for developing carbon capture and sequestration technology.
the stimulus plan takes into account national packages to boost the economy, like those already announced by britain, italy and germany.
the stimulus plan, one of the world's largest, promises to carry the modernity of china's coasts deep into the hinterlands, buying the kind of great leap forward it took the united states decades-and a world war-to build, and priming china for a new level of global competition.
the stimulus plan, running through 2010, may be doubled, creating an investment boom, as the central and provincial governments start extra spending programs, sun mingchun, an economist with nomura international, said feb. 25.
the stimulus program--which provided subsidized loans to borrowers to inject billions of dollars of cash into the economy--is credited with helping vietnam maintain far stronger growth than most other countries this year despite the worst global recession in decades.
the stimulus programme was fuelled a corporate lending boom by large local groups, which sidelined overseas lenders.
the stimulus skeptics come in two categories.
the stimulus versus austerity debate has become much more heated since last month's summit of the group of 20 industrialised and developing nations.
the stimulus was almost all in the form of tax cuts and transfer payments rather than outlays for investment projects.
the stimulus was also not well co-ordinated, which limits its economic impact.
the stimulus was pouring unprecedented funding into wind, solar, and other renewables; energy efficiency in every form; advanced biofuels; electric vehicles; a smarter grid; cleaner coal; and factories to make all that green stuff in the u.s.
the stimulus, as big as it was, failed to stem the nations declining growth rate.
the stimulus-response model and echo model, based on complexity adaptive system theory, have been applied to explain profoundly the impetus and collaboration mechanism of industrial clusters innovation network.
