you ain't shit, Chef. -Hey, fellas.
you pulled my fuckin' -Hey, guys.
I just made a deal with the people from Hau Phat.
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for a couple of hours with the bunnies.
Hey! Hey! You shittin' me?
no, I'm not.
grab a couple of barrels and get up to that big tent.
come on!
captain.
you're giving away our fuel for a playmate of the month?
Nope, playmate of the year, Chief.
warm 'em up, baby!
warm 'em up!
captain, we get in a fiIre fiIght and run out of fuel...
I want you to tell me how she was.
I made a deal for all of us, Chief. How about you?
you got some mamas in there? -Some what?
forget it, Captain. I'll stay with the boat.
Hey, Captain! Give me a hand.
you know, I got a
I got every one of your pictures.
I got the centerfold, the playmate's review...
the playmate of the year runoff.
I even got the calendar.
Hey, oiseau. How come you got a bird?
I used to be the bird girl at Busch Gardens.
Busch Gardens? -I used to train birds there.
you are
you are Miss December, aren't you? -Miss May.
is it coming?
miss December has black hair. -It's over there.
he's not one of my regular birds.
come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
snatch a crack. Come here.
being playmate of the year...
is the loneliest experience I can imagine.
it's like--You try to express...
your feelings to someone and show them your heart
Yeah, I want to hear about your bird act.
I'd love to hear about your bird act.
but would you mind just puttin' this
would you just mind putting this black wig on for me, please?
and there's this glass wall between you
this invisible glass.
they can see your mouth moving.
I used to train birds for at least two years
that's beautiful. -At Busch Gardens.
this was cascading over your right shoulder.
this was open here.
but they can't hear what you're saying.
I used to train them to stand on their head and ride a bicycle
your right hand was-- -Hey, Chef!
get outta here, man! -Come on!
does he want to talk to you?
later. Give me 1 5 minutes.
you can never really make them hear what you're trying to say.
you okay with kind of bending? That's it.
your ass was sticking out just a little--Hey, man, fuck off!
fifteen minutes!
that's why I tried so desperately...
to show somebody that I had some talent.
little baby macaws.
have you ever seen a baby macaw? -That's kind of open there.
they're all blue-- -Take off, would you?
I got my rights, man!
they make you do things you don't wanna do
like, this picture here.
I started feeling repulsed with myself.
you were just kind of bending forward. Your ass kind of out a bit.
I love training birds.
that's it. That's very--That's it. Voila.
you're beautiful. I just want to
you know, I can't believe it.
me, J. Hicks. I can't believe
I'm really here.
maybe I'm unfiIt to have a relationship...
with a beautiful, innocent boy.
just think, if it hadn't been for the Vietnam War...
I never would have met you, Miss December.
miss May.
I wish--I wish I could fiInd...
just one person...
that could share my point of view.
Oh, you kiss like a bird!
Oh, God! kiss me! kiss me!
who is that?
you're drivin' me crazy! kiss me!
I love birds!
you fiInished yet?
Oh! Fuck!
like a bird! Take me like a bird!
fly, baby! Cock it to me!
fly! -I can fly like an eagle!
fly like an eagle! -It drives me crazy!
it drives me crazy!
Lance, that was somebody's son.
Lance, there were things that they made me do...
that I didn't want to do.
they said, " Pull the ribbons between your legs. "
I didn't want to do it.
but they said that was what was expected of me...
that that's what people wanted to see.
who are you? -Well, I'm next, ma'am.
ha, ha! Hell, I didn't know it was a cherry.
didn't know you never got no pussy. -Shove it, fuckup.
sorry about that. If I'd have known,
I'd take you to New Orleans.
man, fuck you. -Introduce you to
lay off, Chef. -Cherry boy, cherry boy.
you're a fuckin' dog!
come to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up, ya prick.
lay off, Chef.
you're the only fuckin' prick I see around here.
if I wanna play with a prick, I'll play with my own.
what are you gonna do with it, cherry boy?
chef, I said lay off!
chef, knock it off! Give him a break!
what do you think I said?
then give your jaws a rest!
this ain't the army. You are a sailor!
so get out of that frizzly army-looking shirt...
and stop smoking that dope! You hear me?
Lance, what's with all the green paint?
camouflage. -How's that?
so they can't see ya. They're everywhere, Chief.
I want you to stay awake up there, man. You got a job to do.
sampan off the port bow. Sampan off the port bow.
let's take a look, Lance.
bring them in. Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 1 6.
clean, get on that 60!
what's up, Chief?
Ajunk boat, Captain. We're gonna take a routine check.
well, let's forget routine now and let 'em go.
these boats are running supplies in this delta, Captain.
I'm gonna take a look.
my mission's got priority.
you wouldn't even be in this part of the river if it wasn't for me.
until we reach your destination,
captain, you're just on for the ride.
stand by, Lance. -Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.
all right. Come on. Let's bring it over.
look in that forward hooch.
bring the people out of there.
come on! Hurry up, motherfucker!
I got you, Chief.
it's clear, Chief.
okay, that's them. That's them. They're okay.
board and search it. -It's just a fuckin' boat.
there ain't nothin' on it. -Board it and search it.
just some baskets and some ducks, fuckin' bananas.
ain't nothin' on it.
what's wrong? Search it. -There's the goat and some fish.
chef! -Fuckin' vegetables
get on that boat! -There's nothin' on it, man!
get on it! -All right!

motherfucking cocksuckers mothers! -Hold it! Hold it!
let's kill all the assholes!

why the fuck not?
clean? -I'm good.
you okay, Lance? -Shit! Fuck! Shit!
chef! -Look what she was hiding!
you all right? -See what she was runnin' for?
it's a fuckin' puppy.
it's a fuckin' puppy.
give me that dog! -No! You're not gonna get it!
give it to me! -Give me the fuckin' dog, asshole!
fuck you!
Chef-- -You want that? Fuckin' mango too!
she's moving behind you. She's alive. Check her out.
chef! She's moving behind you. Check her out!
all right. All right.
come on, Clean! Goddamn it! -She's not dead. She's wounded.
give him a hand.
just take it easy.
slow down and take it easy. -Chef, wait a minute.
bring her up. -Is she breathing?
she's hurt. She's bleedin'.
bring her on board. We're taking her to an ARVN.
what are you talking about?
we're taking her to some friendlies.
she's wounded. She's not dead. -Get out of there.
the book says
fuck you. Fuck 'im.
I told you not to stop. Now let's go.
it was a way we had over here of living with ourselves.
we'd cut 'em in half with a machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid.
it was a lie.
and the more I saw of them...
the more I hated lies.
those boys were never gonna look at me the same way again...
but I felt like I knew one or two things about kurtz that weren't in the dossier.
do Lung Bridge was the last army outpost on the Nung River.
beyond it, there was only Kurtz.
what do you think? -It's beautiful.
what's the matter with you? You're acting kind of weird.
Hey, you know that last tab of acid I was saving?
Yeah, I know. -I dropped it.
you dropped acid? -Far out.
friendly! Friendly! Friendly!
take me home! -Goddamn it!
fucking shore police! Shit! -Man, you wanna die?
don't keep goin'!
you fuckin' police! -Don't leave me!
fuck you!
you'll get what you deserve!
is there a Captain Willard on board? -Yeah.
captain Willard? -Yeah. Who's that?
lieutenant Carlsen, sir. -Get that light off me!
I was sent here from Nha Trang with these three days ago, sir.
expected you here a little sooner. This is mail for the boat.
don't know how happy this makes me.
Why? -Now I can get out of here, if I can find a way.
you're in the asshole of the world, Captain.
captain, where you going?
see if I can fiInd some fuel and get some information.
pick me up at the other side of the bridge.
somebody go with him. -Chef.
I'll go.
I wanna go.
man, listen to the music, man.
where can I fiInd the CO?
you came right to it, son of a bitch! －Lance.
get down here!
you still got a commanding offiIcer here?
Beverly Hills. -What?
straight up the road, there's a concrete fucking bunker called Beverly Hills!
where the fuck else do you think it would be?
goddamn it! You stepped in my face.
I thought you were dead.
well, you thought wrong, damn it!
I told you to stop fucking with me, didn't I?
you think you're so bad, huh, nigger?
what are you shooting at, soldier?
what the fuck ya think I'm shootin' at?
I'm sorry, sir.
there are gooks out there by the wire.
but I think I killed them all.
you ain't shot shit. Listen.
Oh, shit. He's trying to call his friends.
send up a flare.
think you so bad, huh, nigger? You think you bad, huh?
they're all dead, stupid.
there's one still alive underneath them bodies.
who's the commanding offiIcer here?
ain't you?
you think you so bad?
I got something for your ass now, nigger!
I got something for you now!
he's underneath the bodies, man.
go get the Roach, nigger! -Go get the Roach for me.
roach. Roach.
roach.
got slopes on the wire, man. You hear 'em?
Lance. -Do you hear 'em?
we'll bust 'em!
hear him out there on the wire, man?
Yeah.
I kill you, GI!
you need a flare?
no.
he's close, man.
he's real close.
fuck you, GI! I kill you!
fuck you, GI!
motherfucker.
Hey, soldier.
do you know who's in command here?
Yeah.
holy shit.
Hey, Chief, man. Two guys just got blown off that bridge.
you hang on, man. You're gonna be okay.
what's that? -Mail, man. Mail.
later on the mail. Watch them trees.
there's no diesel fuel, but I picked up some ammo.
let's move out.
did you fiInd the CO, Captain?
there's no fucking CO here.
let's just get goin'.
which way, Captain?
you know which way, Chief.
you're on your own, Captain.
still wanna go on? It's like this bridge.
we build it every night, Charlie blows it right back up again...
just so the generals can say the road's open.
think about it.
who cares? -Just get us upriver!
chef, on the bow.
stand by, Clean. -Let's go!
whose package is that?
shit, you got another one, Clean. -No shit? Wait a minute.
you got one, Miller. Geez, I got some too.
that's it for you. Lance.
Mr. L. B.Johnson, there you go.
far out, man. All right. I've been waitin' for this one.
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.
Lance. I'm fine. I'm fine.
sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.
sue skinned her knee. "
man, I wanna get back to Antoine's.
I remember the time we went up to-- "
how could I fucking forget?
beautiful.
there could never be a place like Disneyland, or could there?
let me know. "
Jim, it's here. It really is here.
there has been a new development regarding your mission...
which we must now communicate to you.
months ago, a man was ordered on a mission which was identical to yours.
we have reason to believe that he is now operating with Col. Kurtz.
Saigon was carrying him MIA for his family's sake...
but they assumed he was dead.
then they intercepted a letter he tried to send to his wife.
captain Richard Colby.
he was with Kurtz.
Disneyland.
fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.
Charles Miller Manson ordered the slaughter of all in the home...
anyway as a symbol of protest.
that's really weird, ain't it?
purple haze. Look, man. -Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.
I got a tape from my mom.
rainbow reality, man.
Hey, Chief, get a good whiff.
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.
she pictures me at home having a beer watching TV.
Hey, Lance, man. -Oh, hot potato, hot potato.
I'm so glad you decided to join the navy.
Eva's not sure she can have a relationship with me, you know.
here I am, 1 3, 000 fucking miles away...
trying to keep a relationship with my ass.
that's much more than I can say for some of your friends.
if this tape is any good...I will have Dad and the family -send you a tape of their own. -Hey, Lance.
there! Over there!
there. Over there!
chef, check out Clean!
captain, he's hit. Clean's hit.
Lance! -Where'd the dog go?
Lance! They got Clean.
Where's the dog? We gotta go back and get the dog.
Hey, Clean. Hey.
Bubba, you can't die, you fucker!
and so I'm hoping that--pretty soon
not too soon--but pretty soon
I'll have a lot of grandchildren to love and spoil.
and then when your wife get 'em back, she'll be mad with me.
even Aunt Jessie and Mama...
will come to celebrate your coming home.
granny and Dad are trying to get enough money to get you a car...
but don't tell 'em because that's our secret.
anyhow, do the right thing...
stay out of the way of the bullets...
and bring your heinie home all in one piece...
because we love you very much.
love, Mom.
clean.
hold on.
throw me the glasses.
Lance, take a 1 6 on the bow.
chef. Chef. On the 60.
fuck me.
Lance.
cover the captain.
cover the captain. Lance.
they're French. They're French.
pick up that weapon! Pick it up! Pick it up!
stand fast. Captain.
all right, you men. Put down your weapons.
we lost one of our men.
we French always pay respect to the dead of our allies.
you're all welcome.
my name is Hubert DeMarais.
this is my family's plantation.
it has been such for 70 years.
and it will be such until we are all dead.
captain, accept the flag of Tyrone Miller On behalf of a grateful nation.
this food is really wonderful, isn't it?
the wine, the sauces.
I can't believe it.
Hey, can I speak with the chef?
the chef speak only Vietnamese.
no kidding? He cooks like this and he can't even speak French?
Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.
Lance.
this is Baudelaire.
it's a very cruel poem for children.
but they need it, 'cause life sometimes is very cruel.
as you can see.
attack repels by the family.
just for this war.
Vietcong, 58.
north Vietnamese, 1 2.
south Vietnamese, 1 1 .
americans, six?
Yes. Well, there were perhaps mistakes.
may I present Captain Willard.
he is of a paratroop regiment.
Madame Sarrault. -Captain.
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. It was just a little story...
about Paris and people starving during the war.
they are all around the table, and there was a silence and somebody say...
an angel is passing by. "
so somebody said, " Let's eat it. "
how long can you possibly stay here?
we stay forever.
no, no. I mean...
why don't you go back home to France?
back home?
I mean, this is our home, Captain.
－Sooner or later, you're-- －No.
you don't understand our mentality
the French offiIcer mentality!
at first, we lose in Second World War.
I don't say that you Americans win, but we lose.
Oh, Papa
in Dien Bien Phu, we lose. In Algeria, we lose.
in Indochina, we lose!
but here we don't lose!
this piece of earth, we keep it.
we will never lose it. Never!
you Americans.
in 1 945, yeah...
after the Japanese war, your President Roosevelt didn't want the French people to stay in Indochina.
So...you Americans implant the Vietminh.
what's he mean? -Yeah, that's true.
the Vietcong were invented by the Americans.
the Americans?
and now you take the French place...
and the Vietminh fiIght you.
and what can you do?
nothing.
absolutely nothing.
the Vietnamese are very intelligent.
you never know what they think.
the Russian ones who help them,
come and give us their money.
we are all Communists. Chinese, give us guns. We are all brothers. "
they hate the Chinese!
maybe they hate the American less than the Russian and the Chinese.
I mean, if tomorrow the Vietnamese are Communists...
they will be Vietnamese Communists.
and this is something that you never understood, you American.
I don't know.
maybe in the future we can make something with the Vietminh.
don't you understand?
the VC say, " Go away. Go away. "
that's fiInish for all the white people in Indochina.
if you're French, American, that's all the same.
'go. " They want to forget you.
look, Captain.
look, this is the truth.
an egg.
the white left...
but the yellow stays!
when I was in Saigon, I spoke to an American politician.
he explained it very well. He said, Look.
yesterday, it was Korea. Today, Vietnam.
tomorrow, Thailand, the Philippines...
then maybe Europe.
come on. Why not Europe?
look what happened in Czechoslovakia recently.
even before Second World War
americans knew exactly what was going on.
they don't want that shit to take over! Lefevre!
all you white people are shit.
they are fighting--fighting for freedom.
freedom? Bullshit.
french bullshit. American bullshit.
Dien Bien Phu, that serious.
all soldiers know they are already dead.
you know anything about Dien Bien Phu?
Yeah, I know. -No, you don't.
not really.
Dien Bien Phu was an error. A military mistake.
a mistake? A voluntary mistake!
voluntary!
all the soldiers knew.
we knew we would be dead.
the generals and the colonels believe it's impossible for the Viets...
to get the cannon up there in the mountains.
but they do.
then they wait for the rain to come.
when it comes, no airplane can fly there.
and our paratroopers jump at 90 meters.
I mean, you know, 90 meters--70 meters.
I mean, that's crazy.
no army in the world can do that.
and they only do that to be dead with their friends.
the French Army was sacrifiIced.
SacrifiIced by the politicians safe at home.
they put the army in an impossible situation where they couldn't win.
the students are marching in Paris protesting, demonstrating.
they stab the soldiers in their back.
the soldier would open the grenade, it wouldn't work.
a piece of paper would fall
union of French Women. " We are for the Viets. "
traitors! Communist traitors at home.
Dien Bien Phu, okay.
the French is shit, huh?
no one care. No one want
why don't you Americans learn from us, from our mistakes?
mon Dieux, with your army, your strength your power, you could win if you want to!
you can win.
you know, I'm sure we can make something here.
I'm sure about it, you know?
I never do something wrong to the people here.
that's right, but the Communist at home have never been traitors.
capitaine, good night.
he was a Socialist, you know.
I know that we can stay.
I know that we can stay. We can.
you know, we always helped the people.
we work with the people.
so we can be friends, we are agreed.
see, Captain, when my grandfather and my uncle's father came here...
there was nothing--Nothing.
the Vietnamese were nothing.
so we worked hard...
the rubber from Brazil, and then plant it here.
we took the Vietnamese, work with them...
make something--something out of nothing.
so when you ask me why we want to stay here, Captain...
we want to stay here because it's ours it belongs to us. It keeps our family together.
I mean, we fight for that.
while you Americans, you are fighting for...
the biggest nothing in history.
I'm sorry, Captain.
I will see if your men need any help to repair your boat...
so that you can go on with your war.
I apologize for my family, Captain.
we have all lost much here.
Hubert--his wife and two sons.
and I have lost a husband.
I understand.
you are tired of the war.
I can see it in your face.
was the same in the eyes of the soldiers of our war.
we called them " Les Soldats Perdus-- "
the Lost Soldiers.
if you like, we can have some cognac.
no. I...
I have to--to see about my men and
the war will be still here tomorrow.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I noticed you had no wine at dinner.
no, I don't drink wine.
I do like Cognac, but I don't want any now. Thank you.
well...
then I--I must drink alone.
will you go back after the war to America?
no.
then you're like us--your home is here.
do you know why you can never step into the same river twice?
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.
I used to prepare a pipe for my husband.
twas the morphine he took for the wounds he suffered in his heart.
he would rage and he would cry, my lost soldier.
and I said to him,
there are two of you. Don't you see?
one that kills and one that loves. "
and he said to me...
I don't know whether I'm an animal or a god.
but you are both.
you want more?
all that matters is that you're alive.
you are alive, Captain.
that's the truth.
there are two of you, don't you see?
one that kills...and one that loves.
can't see nothing. We stoppin'.
you're not authorized to stop this boat, Chief.
I said I can't see a thing,
captain. I'm stopping this boat.
I ain't riskin' no more lives.
I'm in command here, goddamn it.
you'll do what I say.
you see anything, Chef?
why don't they fucking attack, man?
watch it over here, Chief.
got a stump.
Lance, On the fifties.
he was close.
he was real close.
I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him...
as if the boat were being sucked upriver...
and the water was flowing backinto thejungle.
whatever was going to happen...
it wasn't going to be the way they called it backin Nha Trang.
arrows! -Fire!
chef, open up! Fire!
Lance, fire!
chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit firing.
they're just little toy arrows.
cut it out! Quiet!
chief, tell them to hold their fire!
they're just little sticks.
they're just trying to scare us.
quiet!
you got us into this mess, and now you can't get us out...
you got us into this mess, and now you can't get us out...
do ya?
you son of a bitch! You bastard!
Lance, get the wheel!
you savages! Come and get it! You son of a bitches!
a spear?
my mission is to make it up into Cambodia.
there's a Green Beret colonel up there who's gone insane...
and I'm supposed to kill him.
that's fucking typical! Shit!
fuckin' Vietnam mission!
I'm short and we gotta go up there so you can kill one of our own guys?
that's fucking great!
shit! That's fuckin' crazy.
I mean, I thought you were going in to blow up a bridge...
or some fuckin' railroad tracks or somethin'.
that's all right. -No. No, wait. Wait.
we'll go together, on the boat. We'll go with you.
we'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?
part of me was afraid of what I would find...
and what I would do when I got there.
I knew the risks...
or imagined I knew.
but the thing I felt the most...much stronger than fear...
was the desire to confront him.
just keep movin'.
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.
it's all right! It's all right! It's all been approved!
I ain't comin' in there! Them bastards attacked us!
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man. Zap 'em with your siren.
there's mines over there and mines over there too.
and watch out. Those goddamn monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.
Ah, that's a pretty one. Move it right in towards me.
I'm an American. Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.
Hi. American. American civilian. It's all right.
and you got the cigarettes. And that's what I've been dreaming about.
Chelf.
who are you?
who are you?
I'm a photojournalist.
I've covered the war since '64.
I've been in Laos, Cambodia and 'Nam.
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing. This boat is a mess, man.
who are all these people?
Yeah, well, they think you've come to
to take him away. And I hope that isn't true.
take who away?
him! Col. Kurtz.
these are all his children, man, as far as you can see.
hell, man, out here we're all his children.
could we talk to Col. kurtz?
Hey, man. You don't talk to the colonel.
well, you listen to him.
the man's enlarged my mind.
he's a poet warrior in the classic sense.
I mean, sometimes he'll--Well, you say hello to him, right?
he'll just walk by you and he won't even notice you.
then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say...
do you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'?
if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming you.
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you. "
I'm a little man. I'm a little man. He's a great man.
I should have been a pair of ragged claws...
scuttling across floors of silent seas. "
I mean-- -Stay with the boat.
don't go any--Don't go without me, okay?
I wanna get a picture.
he can be terrible and he can be mean...
and he can be right.
he's fighting the war.
he's a great man.
I mean
I wish I had words, you know. I wish I had words.
I could tell you something like, the other day he wanted to kill me.
something like that.
why'd he want to kill you?
because I took his picture.
he said, If you take my picture again...
I'm gonna kill you. "
and he meant it.
see, just lay cool. Lay cool. Lay back. Dig it.
he gets friendly again. He really does.
but you don't--you don't--you don't judge the colonel.
you don't judge the colonel like an ordinary man.
okay, watch it now. These are Americans. Americans!
you can feel the vibe of this place.
let me take your picture.
Hey, could you hold--Hey, hello. Hello.
could you hold up a minute?
Colby.
the heads.
you're looking at the heads.
I, uh--Sometimes he goes too far.
he's the fiIrst one to admit it.
he's gone crazy. -Wrong, wrong!
if you could have heard the man just two days ago
if you could have heard him then, God
you were gonna call him crazy? -Fuckin' A!
I just wanna talk to him.
well, man, he's gone away.
he's gone away.
he disappeared out in the jungle with his people.
I'll wait for him.
he feels comfortable with his people.
he forgets himself with his people.
he forgets himself.
captain?
maybe we should wait back at the boat.
I think you should-- -Okay, Chef.
we'll go back to the boat for a while.
Yeah, stay with Lance.
this colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
he's worse than crazy. He's evil!
I mean, that's what the man's got set up here, man!
it's fuckin' pagan idolatry. Look around you!
shit, he's loco. -Then you'll help me?
fuckin' A, I'll help you.
I'll do anything to get out of this joint.
good boy.
we could blow all them assholes away.
they're so fuckin' spaced out, they wouldn't even know it.
I ain't afraid of fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.
I used to think if I died in an evil place...
then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to Heaven.
but now, fuck
I mean, I don't care where it goes, as long as it ain't here.
so what do you wanna do? I'll kill the fuck.
get out of here.
I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around, check the place out.
see if I can fiInd the colonel, okay?
well, what do you want me to do?
here. You take the radio...
and if I don't get back by 2200 hours...
you call in the air strike.
air strike?
the code is " Almighty " ...
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-four-seven-one-two.
it's all in there.
everything I saw told me that Kurtz had gone insane.
the place was full of bodies
north Vietnamese, Vietcong, Cambodians.
if I was still alive, it was because he wanted me that way.
it smelled like slow death in there
Malaria...and nightmares.
this was the end of the river, all right.
where are you from, Willard?
I'm from Ohio, sir.
were you born there?
Yes, sir.
whereabouts?
toledo, sir.
how far are you from the river?
the Ohio River, sir?
about 200 miles.
I went down that river once when I was a kid.
there's a place in the river--I can't remember
must've been a gardenia plantation or a flower plantation at one time.
it's all wild and overgrown now.
but for about five miles you'd think that...
heaven just fell on the earth...
in the form of gardenias.
have you ever considered...
any real freedoms?
freedoms from the opinion of others?
even the opinions of yourself?
did they say why, Willard?
why they wanted to terminate my command?
I was sent on a classifiIed mission, sir.
it's no longer classifiIed, is it?
what did they tell you?
they told me...that you had gone...
totally insane...
and that your methods were unsound.
are my methods unsound?
I don't see any method...
at all, sir.
I expected...someone like you.
what did you expect?
are you an assassin?
I'm a soldier.
you're neither.
you're an errand boy sent by grocery clerks...
to collect the bill.
why, huh?
why would a nice guy like you wanna kill a genius?
feeling pretty good, huh?
Why?
do you know
do you know that the man
the man really likes you?
he likes you. He really likes you.
but he's got something in mind for you.
aren't you curious about that?
I'm curious.
I'm very curious.
are you curious?
there's something happening out here, man.
you know something, man. I know something that you don't know.
that's right, Jack.
the man is clear in his mind...
but his soul is mad.
Oh, yeah.
he's dying, I think.
he hates all this. He hates it.
but the man's
he reads poetry out loud, all right?
and a voice
a voice
he likes you 'cause you're still alive.
he's got plans for you.
no, no, I'm not gonna help you. You're gonna help him, man.
you're gonna help him.
I mean, what are they gonna say, man, when he's gone, huh?
cause he dies when it dies, man. When it dies, he dies.
what are they gonna say about him? What are they gonna say?
he was a kind man?
he was a wise man? He had plans? He had wisdom?
bullshit, man!
am I gonna be the one that's gonna set them straight?
look at me. Wrong!
you.
almost eight hours.
I'm asleep.
I'm asleep and dreaming I'm on this shitty boat.
fuck.
has it been eight hours?
hello. Almighty. Almighty.

volume 90 number 1 2.
the War on the Horizon.
the American people may fiInd it hard to believe...
that the US is winning the war in Vietnam.
Nevertheless...
one of the most exhaustive inquiries...
into the status of the conflict yet compiled...
offers considerable evidence that the weight of US power...
two-and-a-half years after the big buildup began...
is beginning to make itself felt.
white House offiIcials maintain the impact of that strength...
may bring the enemy to the point where he could...
simply be unable to continue fighting. "
is this familiar?
because Lyndon Johnson fears that the US public...
is in no mood to accept its optimistic conclusions...
he may never permit the report to be released in full.
even so, he is suffiIciently impressed with the findings...
and suffiIciently anxious to make their conclusions known...
to permit experts who have been working on it...
to talk about it in general terms. "
no date, Time magazine.
sir Robert Thompson...
who led the victory over Communist guerillas in Malaya...
is now a RAND corporation consultant...
recently returned to Vietnam to sound out the situation for President Nixon.
he told the president last week...
that things felt much better...
and smelled much better over there. "
how do they smell to you, soldier?
you'll be free. You'll be under guard.
read these at your leisure.
don't lose them.
don't try to escape. You'll be shot.
we can talk of these things later.
we are the hollow men.
we are the stuffed men...
leaning together at peace filled with straw.
alas, our dried voices when we whisper together...
are quiet and meaningless as wind in dry grass...
or a rat's feet over broken glass in a dry cellar.
he's really out there.
he is really there.
shape without form...
shade without color...
paralyzed force...
gesture without motion. "
do you know what the man's saying?
do you?
this is dialectics.
it's very simple dialectics.
it's one through nine. No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.
you can't travel in space.
you can't go out into space, you know...
without like, you know, with fractions.
what are you gonna land on? One-quarter? Three-eighths?
what are you gonna do when you go from here to Venus?
that's dialectic physics, okay.
dialectic logic is, there's only love and hate.
you either love somebody or you hate 'em.
mutt!
you mutt.
this is the way the fucking world is.
look at this fucking shit we're in, man!
not with a bang. A whimper.
and with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, Jack.
on the river,
I thought that the minute I looked at him...
I'd know what to do.
but it didn't happen.
I was in there with him for days.
not under guard.
I was free.
but he knew I wasn't going anywhere.
he knew more about what I was going to do than I did.
if the generals backin Nha Trang could see what I saw...
would they still want me to kill him?
more than ever, probably.
and what would his people back home want if they ever learned...
just how far from them he'd really gone?
he broke from them...
and then he broke from himself.
I'd never seen a man so broken up and ripped apart.
I've seen the horrors
horrors that you've seen.
but you have no right to call me a murderer.
you have a right to kill me.
you have a right to do that.
but you have no right to judge me.
it's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means.
horror.
horror has a face.
and you must make a friend of horror.
horror and moral terror...
are your friends.
if they are not...
then they are enemies to be feared.
they are truly enemies.
I remember when I was with Special Forces.
seems a thousand centuries ago.
we went into a camp to inoculate some children.
we'd left the camp after we had inoculated the children for polio.
and this old man came running after us, and he was crying.
he couldn't say.
we went back there...
and they had come and hacked off...
every inoculated arm.
there they were, in a pile
a pile of...
little arms.
and I remember...
I-I--I cried. I wept like some grandmother.
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.
and I want to remember it. I never want to forget it.
I never want to forget.
and then I realized...
like I was shot
like I was shot with a diamond
a diamond bullet right through my forehead.
and I thought, My God, the genius of that.
the genius.
the will to do that.
perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.
and then I realized...
they were stronger than me because they could stand it.
these were not monsters. These were men
trained cadres.
these men who fought with their hearts...
who have families, who have children...
who are fiIlled with love...
that they had the strength
the strength to do that.
if I had ten divisions of those men...
then our troubles here would be over very quickly.
you have to have men...
who are moral and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill...
without feeling, without passion...
without judgment--without judgment.
because it's judgment that defeats us.
I worry that my son...
might not understand what I've tried to be.
and if I were to be killed, Willard...
I would want someone to go to my home...
and tell my son everything.
everything I did. Everything you saw.
because there's nothing that I detest more than...
the stench of lies.
and if you understand me, Willard, you
you will do this for me.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty. Over.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty standing by. Over.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty standing by.
how do you copy?
they were gonna make me a major for this...
and I wasn't even in their fuckin'army anymore.
everybody wanted me to do it.
him most of all.
I felt like he was up there...
waiting for me to take the pain away.
he just wanted to go out like a soldier...
standing up.
not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade.
even the jungle wanted him dead.
and that's who he really took his orders from anyway.
we train young men to drop fiIre on people...
but their commanders...
won't allow them to write " fuck " on their airplanes because it's obscene.
the horror.
the horror.
calling PBRStreet Gang.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty.
do you read me? Over.
PBRStreet Gang?
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty
the horror.
the horror.
Jung Jae-young
Jung Jae-young Love is talking a walk it ogether at dawn
lee Na-young
lee Na-young Anyone who has held hands
lee Na-young while walking a wooded path will know that love is the greatest thing in the world
it's a forkball
Oh, sorry
try to stay healthy
I may not come to your games anymore
so don't push yourself too hard
Oh, sure
let's break up
please
let's end it now
hey
get lost
just get out of my sight
hey
you said you love me?
what a load of crap
why the hell did you call me out here, anyway?
you can do it over the phone, huh?
you want anything else?
Oh, you bought me this now you want it back?
who the hell wears corduroy now anyway?
shit, you women are all the same!
shit!
what are you waiting for?
you want me to chase you off?
fuck off!
shit, just leave!
okay...
I suppose it's for the best
bye
it wasn't love this time either
I always think that it is
but sooner or later I find out it's not
I haven't experienced love yet, not even first love
these tedious nosebleeds always come when I'm alone
it's 2 o'clock
time to go to the doctor's
my head's photo is in black and white
it's the heart I'm worried about
Oh, so that's the heart
no, those are the lungs
the heart's here
this shouldn't be like this
that's black and white too
it's all black and white
from here it looks like I'm pigeon-chested
that's not the problem
there are two kinds of tumors, malignant ones and gentle ones
but Mr. DONG your tumor is malignant
look here
this here's like that
it shouldn't be like that
if this turns out like that it'll be dangerous
and as you see it's already like that
look at this It's already moved up here
how did that happen?
it's moving all over
it shouldn't be doing that
what do we do?
yes?
Oh, it's me
it's September now
I've three months if I'm lucky so I won't see next year
my head is strange
it's black and white and malignant to boot
I'll go have a drink
it's usually like that people who suddenly Iose next year go drinking
Hey, it's our outfielder
why are you alone today?
I've always come alone
is that so?
hello
is your shoulder okay? Don't play outfield
you should pitch. Pitching is cool
you were so famous in high school DONG Chi-sung, pitcher!
throwing from the right hitting from the left, huh?
a 6-time phoenix Cup winner with MVP and Pitching awards...
the air's no good here
you could catch a disease from this air
lung cancer, malignant...
you're awake
can you see?
the bartender, Why am I here?
can't even hold your liquor
you brought me here?
you think I followed you?
I'm heavy, how did you get me here?
I folded you and put you in a box. Why?
you don't even remember
why'd you drink so much if you can't hold liquor
but for a sleeping drunk guy you look really sweet
you don't snore or flail around
you have no bad mannerisms. I'd never have guessed it
I'll go now
I paid for the room pay me back later
the wind...
I discovered three things today that other people have and I don't
I have no first love
I have no next year
I have no bad mannerisms
someone SPEClAL
directed by JANG Jin
Hey, I've never seen that before
it's new, It isn't sweet
it's selling well
I met that guy
right, you said he's a regular customer
yeah
but, this time...
did you talk to him?
yeah
two words?
a bit more than usual
but, we...
Hey, this is great. This'll sell well
yesterday that guy and I went to a hotel
we're just about all here
we'll start this month's meeting
the leader of our online group, lD 'Pink Mask,' will speak first
here we go!
what the hell's he thinking out there?
let's go!
Hey!
what's with you?
aren't you gonna catch it?
what's the point?
what did that punk say?
have you gone crazy?
yeah I'm crazy, so what?
today's confessional postcard is from a woman in Heukseok-dong with the lD 'Writing Princess'
he cried today
the first time I saw it
what could cause such a good-spirited person to cry so?
and he drank yesterday too
and he drank yesterday too
it's the first time I ever saw him drink
and wouldn't you know it...
this person who never drinks... after not even three shots started shouting about his b&w head and heart and then passed out
first I took him to a hotel
for me to lift and carry a man of his size was not easy
so I had to put him in a box
in the room I just stared at him vacantly
he didn 't snore or move around
I don 't know if he could tell I was there
there was so much I wanted to say and so much I wanted to hear
but with the words all stuck in my throat all I could say was you have no bad mannerisms
that was it
he seemed somewhat annoyed at my comment
waking up to a strange woman talking about him that way, he seemed offended
why does nothing come out the way I wish?
his sad face keeps coming to my mind
is there any way I can make him feel better?
he said he lost his phone...
what's your problem?
why are you doing this?
are you playing with me?
I think this story deserves a mobile phone, huh?
that's right, but what do you think?
is this love?
it could be one-sided love or it may just be compassion
seems like compassion to me
anyway, Miss Writing Princess we 'll send you a mobile phone
we hope that next time you can cheer him up and speak better
I wanted to give you that present, the mobile phone from the station
you don't have one
here's the hotel fee
is that right?
that's $5 too much - What do you think I am?
keep it
you need shampoo?
I heard the news About you and your girlfriend
I know how you feel
still, not catching the ball won't change anything
you think that'll get you points?
I got a call from the majors
from tomorrow you'll start pitching again
last chance
just forget everything and take the mound
forget your mistake that day. It wasn't your fault
of course it will be hard, but just forget that day
the most dramatic moments in baseball occur in the 9th inning
and 9 times out of 10, it's due to the winning team
dramatic moments come in two varieties
the first is when someone excels like crazy, the second is when some crazy fool screws up
strike!
on that day we had a moment of the second type thanks to me
nice pitch!
let's wrap this up!
in that wild and deafening stadium, I still can't understand how I was able to hear her voice
you damned moron!
if we break up like this you'll go meet someone new
how long will it last?
a week? A month?
and you'll meet someone else again
but then you'll discover again it wasn't love
that's the way you are!
your love is too weak. Just die!
if you say you love me, then you can die with me
if we die that way, then the love we wanted will come true
don't let go of love you fool!
that most dramatic moment in baseball was of my making
for the first time, I was on the sports papers' front page
a Strange Celebration
he's really going to make him a starter
manager Heo must be crazy
Yeah, but you never saw him in college
I heard he was a big deal back then
but this is different this is the pro league
I heard he broke his shoulder too
I met him once in a fall preseason game
I'd never seen a pitch like that
I couldn't even swing
did he throw that fast?
I'd never seen a pitch so scary in all my life
take your base!
I had no time to duck
then the way you keep forgetting names and phone numbers.... that's when it started?
that wasn't all of it
I found out later the girl he dated back then was a fan of mine
so he beaned you on purpose?
crazy fool
cool though, isn't it?
we throw the ball to get an out
Chi-sung threw it for love
how hard were you throwing just now?
at about 80%
just think of it as throwing for practice
maybe next year you can start again as a pitcher
by next year... it'll be a new season
excuse me
Yes, how can I help you?
I came to get some money...
excuse me?
I mean, a loan or something...
club members, prepare yourself
you brought your stamp and lD card?
a house mortgage for $100, 000?
yes
on the floor!
get down!
what the hell's with you? On the floor!
this freak's got a death wish!
get down!
I... don't have a death wish...
you think that's why I'm doing this?
I want to live too!
look, you guys
you... one, two three, four...
why are there so damned many? You nine guys!
are you a baseball team?
you guys are doing this in order to live well
but I'm getting a loan, 'cause I'm gonna die
you guys are waving guns around, 'cause you wanna live
what about me?
I have no choice but to die!
so I'm mortgaging my home so what?
you!
do you know what love is?
but why did you do it in such a big group?
we heard that once 8 people had done it
we thought we'd try to set a new record
you talked a lot with the man who came for a loan?
we were just listening
first he started talking about the loan
then what did he start yelling about?
something in black and white?
then what? He started going on about love
from then on it was mostly talk about love
then I said what's so great about love?
you meet a woman ask her name
once you know her name you start loving her
then you ask her age and her favorite food...
how did you...?
it's a mobile phone
the one I got from the station
it takes pictures and the color's nice
I've got money too
I never asked you for this
and why are you following me?
I didn't follow you. - Then how'd you find...?
you asked the real estate broker!
damn guy, always telling people where I live
why don't you remember me?
my home is just 39 steps from here
it used to be over 60 but now it's just 39
I'm not following you
you told me yourself and even pointed it out
my mom asked me to give you this
Oh, you just moved in?
where is your new home?
around that corner the second house on the right

goodbye

I got a 3rd prize Lotto ticket about three times, she's the female lead but she dies in the end
is it still interesting if you know how it ends?
it's too startling if they die all of a sudden
it's just too sad
the male lead can be sad, but why are you?
and if you know beforehand, will you not be sad?
perhaps so
Oh, I dunno
better not watch it
long time no see
how have you been?
fine
you know my friend?
Oh, sure
hello
it's been a while, Chi-sung
I thought you didn't like movies
so you come to the theater after all...
I got a free ticket
who's that? Your girlfriend?
no... just... someone I know
Really?
anyway, I'm glad you're well. I was worried
enjoy the movie
sure .- Let's go. - Okay.
do you 'just know' a lot of women?
what?
are there a lot of women you 'just know?'
how many?
you're the first
no one else
I'm relieved
what a relief
I feel much better now
the film was about one woman's love and about an old telephone pole she always stared at
a telephone pole as the hero
what a weird movie
the man she loved lived in the city
he used his fists for cash earning enough to scrape by
he always thought about the woman waiting for him
he resisted the temptations of city women without his love wavering in the slightest
could only happen in a movie
the two loved each other under the pole and parted from each other there
and the old pole witnessed it all
even at dawn as the sun rose, she always waited for him under the pole
when the sun fell and it became night she went home
this tedious movie finally ended in a scene where the man comes back for her
I thought the film was about his undying love but it suddenly turned into an action movie
damned incoherent film
on top of that the woman coughed a few times and collapsed for no reason and the man who couldn't go back also collapsed
in front of him a strange telephone pole appeared
he reached out his hand to the pole
he closed his eyes thinking about her
and then a strange thing happened to the telephone pole
his tremendous yearning for her love entered the electrical wires and began to flow
his love passed through countless poles and wires making its way to her
and finally it reached the old pole where she lay
and our hero the pole passed on the man's love
to sum up, in a word, Iove rode the electrical wires and reunited our lovers in this unbearably stupid movie
thanks for the movie and for dinner
and the mobile phone too
your parents must be worried, it's late
they passed away both of them
mine too
it was the same day
on that neighborhood club trip they were on the same plane
Hi, Chi-sung? It's Dad
we're taking off now
how can such a big thing like this fly?
amazing, I tell you
have a good trip Dad my game's about to start
Oh, really?
are you in the outfield again today?
when are you going to pitch?
you're not gonna pitch anymore, are you?
ha...
now! We're flying now!
the wheels are off the ground!
what? Now we're going down again?
honey, why are we going down?
we'll go up again later. - Wait we're heading for the ground!
we're gonna hit the ground!
Chi-sung, it's the end
Chi-sung, your father loves you!
on the first day he flew he passed away
he took a plane and went to heaven
even at his last moment he told me that he loved me
you're supposed to turn off your phone at takeoff
how'd he manage that?
he didn't know it was his first time!
goodbye
this trash... I'll throw it out at home
are you looking after Mr DONG?
yes
I'm looking after him now
a word, please
how long has it been like this?
the two of us, you mean?
no, not that
how long has he been so sick?
Oh... I'm not sure
why, is he very sick?
it has progressed too far
tastes bitter
have a candy
stand by the wall
move closer
just a minute
that's fine
what's that? This is fun
don't bring me any more medicine
thief! Catch him!
sounds like a thief came
I guess so
good night, then Bye
out of the way! I'll kill you!
I'm not blocking you
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?
that's my home dammit!
Hey, you son of a bitch!
Hey, doing this at your age?
why can't you just work hard and earn money?
doing this sort of thing at night is hard work
I can't believe you
living is hard for me too
but I'd never live the way you do
Hey, do you know what love is?
I thought of killing myself too
rather than live like this, I thought of killing myself
I may be young, but I've a wife and two kids
so I need to live
if I die what happens to them?
my life isn't my own
I have to find some way to get by
go and live, you punk
sir!
I'll heed your words and live well
I'll come visit too
don't come after two months. I'll be gone
if you move, call me
I'll repay your kindness
I won't be able to call
live well, don't die
go on
as for me, I don't know much about love
but love... is just love, isn't it?
what kind of love doesn't matter
if you love, then that's love
but I'm just a thief, so I don't know much
goodbye
I've nothing to give you so I'll leave you with that, sir
what are you doing, miss?
what's everyone doing here?
do you know this house's owner?
Why?
what's your relation with DONG Chi-sung?
I'm just... a woman he knows
what? Then I'm a detective he doesn't know
we've found the stolen item
and also some bundles of cash
what? Is it stolen?
well, it seems it might be
for a guy whose shoulder still isn't 100%, how can he throw that fast?
just try hitting that. lt'll kill you
don't embarrass me here, just give me something gentle
what is it?
why didn't you tell me?
why did you do it you're a nice man
you're not that smart or good-looking, but you're nice
look, what are you talking about?
how did you end up here?
I asked directions
that's not what I mean
I meant, why are you here?
let's talk at home
you can't go home!
you can't They'll catch you if you do
so you don't know how to contact the thief?
what's the point?
we're being accused of robbery!
we can't turn him in, he's got a loving wife and kids
let's just go to the police and explain everything
why do you keep saying 'we'?
go to the station and explain it Why run away?
I don't have time
going to the station and explaining it all and being dragged from here to there
I don't have time for that
are you so busy?
you don't seem so busy to me
could I stay at your home a few days?
Nah, it'll just be a nuisance
no, it's not that... I'm fine...
I worry you might be uncomfortable...
whatever you want
this room's for sleeping?
you mean the two of us?
no, I asked if you sleep here
you got a language problem...
I sleep here on the floor
I used to use the bed but I kept falling off and hurting myself...
you want to wash up?
I'll go out and buy something
see how things are doing outside
is stealing such a huge crime?
the place is swarming with cops
you cook well
try some of this, too
damn, that's salty
the game's on...
you don't know baseball at all?
if you get to there it's one point?
you go to 2nd and 3rd then come back
can you run straight from 1st base to 3rd?
no, they'll yell at you
that guy's got much better
is he good?
no
that's not so hard
if you catch that hit ball...
the fielder? - Yes
if the fielder catches it...
a ground ball?
Yes, if you catch a ground ball and chuck it into the crowd what happens?
not to first base? - Yeah, if you just chuck it into the crowd
Chuck it...
you can't do that
but, why would you throw it there?
just for fun Can't you?
you can't
you don't know anything
I'd love to see that
that'd be fun
the game's finished
should I change the channel?
what would you do if you had two months to live?
what?
let's say you had only two months more to live, what would you do?
could I die any faster?
what?
do I have to wait out the two months?
could I just get it over with quickly?
it's a pain waiting two months with nothing special to do
you're right
Yes, she's correct
for a person with two months to live the biggest agony is waiting those two months
there isn't much you can do to ease that pain
I haven't written a will
because I have no one to list in it
I know that my heart will never withstand this
not many people commit suicide by marathon
but it's a clever choice
it won't be too painful
I can think things over before I die
today, I'm leaving this earth
the 5th place prize was a kimchi refrigerator
this must be really expensive!
why'd you buy me this?
I don't have any family... Thank you
I don't know if I should accept this...
what should I do?
what do I put in here? Can I only put in kimchi?
hey
are you sleeping?
no, not yet
come here a minute...
sit here and listen
you like this song, right?
a long time ago...
when I was in high school
I often heard it while walking past your window
so I started liking this song too
why did you start liking me?
I forget, it's been so long
do you still like me that much?
you didn't even know I existed
you didn't know who I was, where I lived, how long and from how close
I could feel your presence
what I liked... or what I disliked
I'm sorry for living without knowing
I'm sorry
there's a lot I'm doing for the first time
so... there's a lot I don't know
it's a thief!
Hey, you! - Sir!
would you like some tea, or fruit?
Oh, thank you. - Look, you!
what are you doing back so soon?
and in the same neighborhood!
you think this is your workplace?
do you commute back and forth?
actually, that day I met you after receiving your great generosity, I decided to quit this work
then why are you back scaling walls?
life has fenced me in
darling, do you know what love is?
well...
it would be nice to buy a computer, hook up the internet and all that
is that all you can say?
don't you know? What love is?
I love you
should I quit this job?
sleep when others sleep, work when others work
there's nothing wrong with me
you and the kids... surely we can get by hand to mouth?
honey, l... - You want that too, right?
you don't like staying up worrying about me?
should we try to live honestly? - That's great - but... - I can cook well
I can try getting a job at a restaurant
even with manual labor we can still feed ourselves, right?
honey, l...
I'm pregnant again
I'm so sorry, you can't go home because of me
forget it, just go
don't forget your bag
next time you run away since you can't go there hide at our place
thank you for offering, ma'am
I may be nothing but a petty thief but I still have moral integrity
you suit each other well!
I don't know what brought you together but don't ever part!
you're pigeon-chested
Yes, I've been hearing that since I was young
so that comes out in the photo, too
listen closely
there are two kinds of tumors, malignant ones and the gentler ones
please continue
but this one is malignant
look here
this here's like that
it shouldn't be like that
if it turns out like that it won't be good - Darling! - Look at this it's already moved up here
what with all of you these days?
moving all over the place...
but this... something's moving all over the place?
have we spoken in this manner before?
what?
you're pigeon-chested right?
Yes, I'm quite famous for that
Hello? Darling It's malignant
I miss you!
we should take action on this quickly
Dong Chi-sung is hiding a disease right now
if the capillary in his nose has grown so weak then he'll experience almost constant nosebleeds
if this continues he could develop serious anaemia
the surgery takes 20 minutes he should do it soon
how did this develop?
there are two possible causes
first, stress and fatigue can bring it on in people with inherently weak nose capillaries
the other possibility is if from early childhood one utilizes a part of one's body to aggressively remove objects in the nose cavity, it can happen
I think it's the first thing you mentioned
at first, that's what everyone wants to believe
will it take much longer?
is it hard to put on?
does it fit?
we can change it, if not
I've never worn anything like this
it's too revealing
I can't wear an undershirt， my stomach will be cold
it's time for your medicine
I'll be pitching the day after tomorrow
will you come watch?
actually... I wasn't going to pitch anymore
I just... Just one last time I thought... I'd try taking the mound
don't pick your nose
stop, You can't pick your nose anymore
Yes, well...
Mr. DONG Chi-sung?
yes?
I'm a policeman
what?
catch that bastard!
Dong Chi-sung...
a baseball player Outfield
I'm a pitcher
you know this man?
no, I don't
why'd you kill a man you don't know?
we found a handbag in your room
inside that bag was this watch
the watch still works fine
but the watch's owner is dead
the watch has gone dead too
Chi-sung...
the sun has risen
the sun is up but if you keep saying you don't know anything, I'm going to get real angry
I told you everything I know
there's something you don't realize
in this room here you even have to talk about things you don't know
in this room ignorant men become intellectuals, blind men talk about things they've seen and deaf men talk about things they've heard, got it?
what if they're deaf and dumb?
damn, the blood pressure!
let's try this again
so on the day of the murder the thief entered your home and you reassured him and sent him home
I don't know if he went home directly
and the thief Ieft the bag at your home so you gave him $2000 in return
it wasn't some kind of trade, it's just... he was having a hard time, so...
does that make any sense?
he's got a hard life so you give him $2000?
Hey, my life is hard too!
you think I get rich running around investigating?
I want $2000 too!
well, I can give it to you
go to my home and under the blanket...
Oh, the blood pressure again!
Dong Chi-sung
you're free to go now
but Chief!
we've identified the murderer
it was the victim's girlfriend
but it seems she planned to commit suicide
luckily we found her will
she wrote all the details of the crime in it
we're trying our best to find her
if she's not dead we'll catch her soon
anyway, sorry to have troubled you
that's the way this job is sometimes
try to understand
but why did she do it?
she said she loved him too much
that happens with love sometimes
dying, killing...
Oh, and your doctor asked us to give you this
Chi-sung pitch well today
pitching suits you better than the outfield
chief, do you know that guy?
good afternoon - Yes?
Oh, it's you again - Yeah...
is DONG Chi-sung here?
that baseball player?
he must be at the baseball stadium Look...
you're out!
it's been quite chilly recently but with the nicer weather, a lot of fans came tonight
doosan vs Lotte bottom of the 6th
Dong Chi-sung is still on the mound
gong got selected as one of the players and he's doing a good job up to the middle of the 5th
quite an unexpected performance from DONG
with Doosan losing starters to injury we thought they'd be using a lot of relievers
this is quite unexpected
if DONG takes them past the 7th inning, Doosan will have a chance
are you okay?
you're over 1 00 pitches - Let's bring in the next guy - No, l...
I just want... for as long as I can throw... I want to throw
and the pitch... A hit
Oh, it's a hard hit ball
it's going way back
it's still going...
it's over the fence!
it's a 2-run home run!
it's 2-0, Doosan is ahead
Dong Chi-sung winds up. It's in play!
it's a single
his third pitch, inside
it's a fly ball
well, I expected KO would close out the game, but DONG is still in there
of course it's nice to pitch a complete game but they can 't afford to worry about that now
I've spent a long time asking just what love is
amazingly however curious I was I never looked up the word in the dictionary
because I knew I wouldn't believe what it said
but what's obvious is today I'm pitching for someone special - It's in play! - He got it
Dong fielded it on one hop
Dong had a great game today
his second debut in the pros was a big success
doosan wins, 2-0
he's not throwing it
this is the last throw I'll ever make
now the woman I know and everyone else will never forget this image of me
goodbye, everyone
I was really curious
if I fielded a ball and threw it into the crowd what would happen?
yes
did you see it?
you wouldn't believe the look on the manager's face
what if you can never play again?
no big deal if I can't
anyway, come on over I made dinner
I doubt there will be any food at your home so eat here
and the house has been feeling empty lately
if it's cold out you can stay the night too
Hello?
Hello?
let go, dammit!
Hey, where is that quack?
are you hiding? Let go! Don't look at me!
my tumor's moving all over, is it?
what the hell's moving, huh?
let go of me!
where are you?
I mortgaged my house because of you!
I lost my job!
Hello?
who?
Oh, boss!
he's over there now?
get in, I'm gonna start driving!
all right, all right
come on, you're drunk
you need to get in first!
Hey, gimme that!
Hey, Yi-yeon
stop drinking and let's go
uh, who do we have here?
our Writing Princess
get in, we're about to go
let's go home
home?
I have no home, dammit
I spent all my damn money!
got fired from my job!
what?
you gonna let me stay?
at your house?
Why?
do you love me?
you interested in me?
why do you do this to me?
are you not sure?
why do you talk that way?
do you really not know?
are you asking because you're curious?
damn, tell me if you love me!
I love you
don't worry
he'll come back when he's sober
he can't drink where'd he pick up these bad mannerisms?
I'll be going now - Huh? Sure - His bag... - Huh?
Oh, sure
sorry, I'm sorry
but l... I don't know anything
I could've just lived two months and then died but why did I have to live?
if I died, I think I could understand everything
it would be a relief
that would be great
I don't know
dammit
does it hurt?
it hit you hard
I'm not sure yet
but have we met before?
you're the woman from the stadium
so you'll really die?
I guess I will
this is what you wanted to love and then die
lucky you
I don't know
why am I so sad?
what?
it's what you wanted
I guess it wasn't
I guess you can only feel it when you're alive
wait a minute wait
what's so great about love?
you meet a woman, ask her name
once you know her name you start loving her
then you ask her age her favorite food...
love is just... waiting
you can go to it
love is waiting for you, go!
whether it's ball four or you're hit by a pitch...
I don't know much about love
but love... is just love, isn't it?
what kind of love doesn't matter
if you love...
she said she loved him too much
that happens with love sometimes, dying, killing...
I hear you breathing
your breathing...
so you're alive
I just want to stay here for as long as you are alive...
is that okay?
I...
I want to ask you something
what's your name?
Yi-yeon
han Yi-yeon
that's pretty
thank you
so... Shall l... escort you home?
my bag...
how old?
Oh, twenty-four
and your favorite food?
cup noodles
Ah, noodles
your hobby?
radio - Right
right, radio The postcards...
your blood type is O?
b
people with B their personality...
nice
I'm type O
today I received three things that other people had and I didn't
I got next year
I got bad mannerisms and I got first love
Oh, really... When did you get measles?
when I was seven - Oh, seven...
your blood type... - I already told you!
just now?
did I say I'm type O? - Yes
let me see, Chris. Chris Miles?
Ah, just a minute...
Ah, good.
Chris. In life, we're all walking down a path.
and when that path lacks direction, that's when people get lost.
and we don't like lost people, because no-one should get left behind. Are you following me?
I'm a bit lost.
so glad we agree.
I'm afraid you can't take your exams here.
are you saying I'm being expelled?
I prefer the term "no longer permanently affiliated."
Why?
it's less discouraging.
no. Why am I being kicked out?
let's take a look, shall we?
the nurse's office.
three days ago. - I had a headache.
are you peeing on the science block? - Nope.
that's my desk. - That's not even me.
Ah, this is invasion of privacy!
I'll cut to the chase.
we've no coursework from you and the exams are about to start. You're a shit student.
your inevitably shit results will affect my averages, and then I'll be swimming in a river of shit and I didn't pack a snorkel.
we'll send you a letter saying when you have to leave your student flat.
look, this isn't right... just...
Wah-wah!
welcome to the real world.
come on, Chris.
wanna hear a joke? What do you call nacho cheese?
Oh, shit. I got that wrong.
how does that nacho cheese joke go?
right...
right. OK. Bye!
what do you call cheese that doesn't belong to you?
nacho cheese?
have you heard it before?
I've got nothing, absolutely nothing.
it's not all that bad.
I've been kicked out of college,
I'm homeless and I'm never going to see Angie ever again.
Oh, dry your eyes, Princess.
huh?
maybe you should stop being such a pussy and get off your arse and go do something about it.
Oh, fuck it.
right. Saying "fuck it" works for you, then?
not really.
then maybe you should, you know, try.
I do try!
don't l?
No!
that's all you ever say - no.
no way! - Ah-ha! See? There you go.
always saying no. No to pills, to parties... to me putting my hand on your gooch.
OK. OK. So let's make a deal.
I'll start saying "yes," and you stop saying "fuck it."
I'm gonna have to have that in writing, I'm afraid. Use your pen.
who says l've got a pen?
will you buy me a falafel?
Yes.
bollocks.
so, Derek, let's see what we've got left.
slough Metropolitan University, Abergavenny tech,
cambridge Ringroad University...
come in!
bad time?
Derek needs to go away, have a nice sit down and consider his UCAS options.
right, l've been to the job Centre, yeah...
and they're a bit...
well, they're all just fu... fuddy-duddies.
Yeah! They are fuddy-duddies.
right. they're like, "just queue up here, fill in this box here, "don't steal that." It's a load of cra...
cranberry juice! Do you want cranberry juice?
Thanks.
erm...
anyway, yeah, there's one lady there, l've never met such a big fat bi...
biscuit! Do you want a biscuit?
how can I help?
well, I was thinking.
seeing as you're a careers officer... . I thought you could... you know... . help me get a job.
Oh! yeah! totally!
yeah? Fucking ace!
Chris! Swearing.
Oh...
let's get you a job!
what happened, Chris?
there's loads of these Chinese lads flipping burgers there.
me and Han Li were having a spliff break, and then Paul, the shift manager, comes along.
and she said, "you can't do that."
why not? It's pucking hard getting people to talk to you.
I mean child abuse, it's a bit depressing. So my theory was, reel them in with the free porn, then get to the serious stuff.
so I said, "Why can't people bring their own glasses to the bar??
no wonder this country's turning obese.
but Morris said that was the job, and if I didn't like it, I could puck off.
so I told him he was a pitty boss and a pastard and he could pucking shove his pub polo up his pap's-eye, stupid prick.
I think one slipped through there, Chris.
stupid punt.
what are you going to do?
do you remember them colouring-in books when you were little, Jose?
I hated them.
if I'm gonna do a picture of a house, I don't want someone else telling me what it should look like, know what I mean?
I hate this conformist, repressive society and its stupid culture of conformity, right.
you know, everybody listens to the same plastic music and does the same plastic job, and dresses the same plastic way.
I know, man. I know. totally.
I mean, you're cool because you've got drugs.
but most people just haven't got a clue how they come across.
murmur OF AGREEMENT. Yeah, man. Yeah, that's right.
look at this guy. He is so mainstream.
I mean, nobody thinks for themselves any more.
individuality is dead.
originality is a dirty word.
I mean, the only original thing left to do is get totally fucking wasted.
like us. - Go for it, man.
what are you doing?
Shotguns! you gotta try this.
what's up with your hair?
Why? Don't you like it?
no. No, no, no. It's fine. Really.
right. Enough bollocks.
time to get drunk.
your turn.
come on, let's party. Man like me don't even like beer but I'm brap-brap-brapping this all day, blood.
brap brap brap.
OK. Yes.
brap brap brap!
fuck off!
try again.
No!
what was that? No?
I don't have to say yes to everything. - Um, I think you do.
one, two, three, four... - Yo, that guy's hat is nang!
his hat game is strong.
why don't you go get his hat for An? - What?
go get his hat. Go on.
easy peasy.
what?
Oh, my God! It's Cassie!
so what happened in Scotland? Did you eat loads of deep-fried shit?
did you get me a kilt?
not an actual deep-fried shit. But, you know.
so how was it?
Oh, it was just... Iife.
but I want to hear all your gossip.
when did you two first get together, by the way?
by his hospital bed?
huh?
don't you know?
lovely Sid and lovely Michelle are fucking.
we're not... Not in the way you're thinking, anyway.
don't lie, Sid.
I know your dad's dead, but you can't just go around doing whatever you want.
what's going on?
Cassie just said that Sid and Michelle are doing it.
but tony didn't know. And neither did l.
or Chris. Or Maxxie. Or you. Probably.
but, hey. Hey, Cassie's back! Woo!
listen, Jal... - Why didn't you tell me?
it's awkward.
if you can't talk to your best mate about it, then... maybe it's not awkward but completely fucking shit.
do you want to get out of here?
it's beautiful here.
that was mental, what you did tonight.
brilliant mental.
yeses are good.
Yeah. Yeses are good.
don't forget your side.
Oh, I haven't. I made 50 quid off that powder tonight so, er, life's looking up.
where you going?
that's cheating. I hate cheats, Chris. My dad's a cheat.
what you doing?
play the game, Chris.
I am.
there was a note on your door.
What'd it say?
you've got to leave today.
shit. Better pack my stuff up, then.
is that it?
where are you staying?
Oh, you know.
nowhere.
it's fine.
see you round, Cass.
your CV is... unusual.
we don't get many written on cigarette packets.
I like to recycle.
by a few of your GCSE subjects, you've put a question mark.
I wasn't sure if they counted. - Why not?
I achieved fail grades.
I see.
so, I'm looking for a trainee.
somebody good with people, a talker.
well, I'm... I'm a talker. I mean, l've been talking for...
well, I don't know how long exactly, but years.
and I know loads of words as well.
like apivorous, for example.
what's that?
someone who eat bees.
OK. Er... A little test.
sell me this cup of tea.
um...
right. OK. Tea. It's...
shit. Er...
right...
would you like to buy this mug of tea?
no, thanks.
that's an interesting tie, can l...? Do you mind if I have a little?
Ahh! Ahh!
sure I can't offer you that tea?
here!
right. Fair enough. Just a teeny note.
that won't work with houses, OK?
Yeah, OK.
everyone, this is Chris, the new trainee.
I'll have the papers sent straight over. Bye-bye.
brazil cara-a-a ha-a!
Yabba doo-doo.
and Jon.
the sales table.
I'll let you get your bearings.
so what do you get if you win, then? A pack of chocolate buttons?
don't be stupid.
you get a balloon.
looks like you're not doing too well there, mate.
Yeah, well, first day.
PAH! That's what they all say.
Chris, is it?
Yeah. - Let me give you a bit of advice, Chris.
I'm the Sir Alec round here, yeah?
even if you signed Rooney, Ronaldo, Wright-Philips, Adebayor, you wouldn't have the balls to get above me.
I wouldn't sell you Rooney or Ronaldo, anyway.
or Wright-Philips.
or Adebayor. yeah?
not really that into football, so...
Hah! Poof!
Mrs Smith? Hi there.
Yes, looking good for you.
so as I was saying earlier, the kitchen is a real deal maker.
Wow.
if I could afford a kitchen like this, my wife would never have left me.
and in here particularly, we've got huge amounts of LSD.
it's not what you're thinking, madam.
light, space and drawers.
if you're still humming and hawing,
Iet me tell you a little secret.
the owners'll accept 20 below the asking. Have we got a deal?
I think we do.
Thanks.
OK, this next place has been on the market for about a year.
it's spatially challenged so it's a little tricky to rent.
ball's in your court. Don't worry, it just needs the right patter.
just, er, wait till you see the kitchen.
it's a real deal maker.
if I could afford a place like this, my wife might never have left me!
Oh.
sorry. Watch your, er... yeah.
Yeah, watch your feet.
so this place is great for doing LSD.
no, no.
light.
space.
and drawers.
garden.
er, tell you a secret?
what do you think? Look, we've got electric lights.
on and off. We've got luxury radiators.
er... We've got, like, four plug sockets!
I mean, imagine, who'd need that many? Like, Puff Daddy or someone.
well, la-di-da.
I mean, sure, it needs some stuff.
but structurally, it's...
right, you dozy mare. Get your fucking knickers off!
So...you've got a job and a flat in one day.
Yes, I did.
I think that's playing the game.
Yes, it is.
I think you deserve a reward.
no?
that word's banned.
reward me.
what? Oh.
Oh. Wow.
thanks for letting me stay, Chris.
that's OK.
just for a bit, yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, jal. Have I shown you the bedroom?
we're gonna have some mad fun in here, eh, jal?
Yeah. We will.
Yeah, there's gonna be pills, and pucking and pillows.
lots of pillows...
Chris and jal.
jal and Chris.
more couples.
more and more couples.
have you ever been in love?
I don't think so.
do you want me to describe it to you?
OK.
do you remember when you rode with me in the ambulance after I tried to kill myself?
of course.
that's what love feels like.
we can arrange that, Mrs Collins. HE MOUtHS yeah... May I say I'll be sorry not to be speaking to you every day?
that's right. yeah.
Yeah, sure, sure.
I'll call your solicitor first thing in the morning about completion.
can I have a word?
that's right. Oh, that's marvellous.
many thanks. Bye-bye.
G-o-o-o-o...
it's just you've... you've not sold anything yet.
you've been here a while now and...
no, no, I understand.
if there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.
a muzzle, maybe?
he does sell properties, son.
fuck off out of here, you little prick.
thanks for the duvet cover.
that's OK. - you know when you were little, did you ever use to unbutton the covers and get inside?
when you were young, did you ever read the very Hungry Caterpillar?
it's a classic.
it's about this caterpillar, yeah, and he eats a load of stuff, and then he gets in a cocoon and becomes a butterfly.
and after my brother died, whenever my parents were just...
you know, I'd get inside my duvet and I'd just read it over and over.
and it made me think that... when I came out, I didn't want to be different.
I just wanted what was outside to be different.
and was it ever?
no.
I'm gonna get sacked, jal.
tthe boss knows I'm a fuck-up.
do you remember what you wanted the house to look like when you came out the duvet?
maybe you can sell that.
you're not a fuck-up, Chris.
anybody got any poppers?
so this is the window leading from the...windowy room, into the...sofa-ry room.
this is so lovely.
but it's...just out of our budget.
I'm not sure we can pay the asking.
the owner won't budge, I'm afraid.
then it looks like we're wasting your time. I'm sorry.
sorry, can I just...?
money.
it's just bits of paper, or numbers on a screen, innit, really?
but these walls, they exist.
if you can imagine memories happening in them, then that's real.
I just... I want you to imagine dying.
right, I know it sounds weird but just...
right, you're really old, and you're in your bed and you're remembering your life.
right... your daughter's first birthday.
shagging on a Sunday afternoon.
skinning up in the garden... with the kids.
right, when you do that, is this the house that you see in all those memories?
cos if it is, then a few bits of paper here or there don't really seem to matter.
you're right.
Really? - We'll take it.
brilliant. Right, let's get back to the office, then.
so what line of work are you in? - We're erotic art dealers.
nice one.
no, I'm good. The job's great, Jal's beautiful, and l've got a flat.
did you get my present?
I never take it off.
I just wanted to say thank you for everything you've done for me.
Oh, Chris. I just gave you the crayons. you drew the house.
I'll call you back.
this is the office.
this is the office div.
let me get you some details.
you must really like your lunch.
maybe you could find me a flat.
Oh!
hello.
it's nice. - Yeah, it is, isn't it?
good location, ceilings, walls, floors. - No, I mean it's nice to see you again.
you look really good in a tie.
I'll take it.
OK... - the flat.
right!
right, good. Good.
she just kept on staring at me, just like she always did.
it's not like anything happened, it's just...
Chris, listen... - Seeing her, it's confusing.
right now's not a very good time.'
Angie makes my pollocks tighten, you know?
after all this time, I still wanna...
Chris, l've gotta go. Sorry.
Bye. Bye.
I'm really sorry you had to hear that.
Oh, don't worry. It's totally cool.
OK. So, how can we help you down your careers path?
I'm thinking of leaving school, growing a beard and joining the circus.
eye of newt, toe of frog.
wing of bat... and tongue of dog.
Cass...what is this?
punch for the housewarming party.
what party?
housewarming party.
Bye, tom!
it's tim.
what are you doing to yourself, Cassie?
throwing myself to the wind. - Do you mind not throwing Chris, too?
Oh...wow.
But...fuck you.
do you think I'm jealous?
jealous of you and your boyfriend and his ex who he's going to fuck because she makes his pollocks tighten?
what?
Angie's back.
he's seen her.
I've had my pain, Jal.
yours is in the post.
what are you doing?
Chris! you've been missing all the fun.
Yeah, what's going on? Who are all these people?
we're having a housewarming party.
Where's jal? - She's gone, Chris.
where?
no. She's gone, Chris.
that's people.
we arrive, consume what we can and then leave. Like locust.
Oi! Fuck off!
what you doing here?
I came with Anwar. He's gone to get me some punch.
when are you going to stop playing these games, Sketch?
green doesn't suit you, Maxxie.
sorry it took so long. Tastes a bit funky, too.
yo, blood.
what?
what is it, dude?
have you seen yourself?
he looks proper lush.
shut it, you!
you're fucking da-humped.
I was passing.
having a party? Where's your girlfriend?
she's eating locusts. Or something.
right.
want to explore?
no. - Chris?
I don't mind about her.
it's not the same, is it?
Chris, are you in there?
Chris, it's me.
I know you wouldn't do it, OK? Chris...
where you been?
your shirt's inside out.
Oh, it's, er...
Oh!
we seem to have a small problem with vermin.
come through anyway.
master bedroom.
second bedroom.
I'm really sorry.
not as sorry as I am.
bye then.
good luck, son.
I'm sorry I got you sacked.
Oh, it would have happened sooner or later.
Where's Jal?
I dunno, Cass.
that's my fault too.
no, it's not. That was mine.
do you know what hurts the most about a broken heart?
not being able to remember how you felt before.
try and keep that feeling because, if it goes... you'll never get it back.
what happens then?
then you lay waste to the world... and everything in it.
well done.
OK. OK, OK...
well done, well done. You were last, but well done.
off you go, son. Go on, go on, don't panic.
keep going. Come on. Good boy! Good boy.
do you want some sandwich?
no, thanks.
OK.
Tony. I've fucked it all up.
again.
shit, dude. Try getting hit by a bus.
that'll really put a dampener on your day.
honestly, have some tuna sandwich.
it'll make you feel better.
promise.
Bye, tony.
see you next week, Anna.
do you ever get depressed about...your accident?
used to.
but who does it help?
I had everything I wanted. And lost it all.
hurts like fuck.
but, Chris... I'm going to get it all back.
piece by piece.
what else is there?
display: PREGNANT
fuck it!
Hi. It's me. Leave a message.
Hi, it's Angie. Look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.
but I hope things work out for you.
I'm going, but there's something I want you to have.
whose flat is this?
a friend of mine left town. I'll tell you later.
thanks for coming.
OK, so l've been thinking about why I always fuck everything up for myself.
and this is the best way that I can explain.
this is how it started for me.
it was good.
then things started going wrong.
then someone else escaped.
the gravity holding us together was gone.
we were floating in space.
it's kinda easy when you've got nothing, because... nothing can't be taken away from you.
but I don't want nothing any more.
is that it? Are you the only person in the world that's been let down?
the only one that's been hurt, abandoned.
are you?
so what gives you the right to act like you are?
Jal...can't you forgive me?
no.
JAL. Don't you understand? I wanna...
make a new fucking pact that means nothing to you?
Yeah. Let's do that.
let's build something. And we'll tear it down.
fuck it. Come on... Come on. Say it! Build something. Tear it down!
you're not who I thought you were.
you're an empty, poisonous smile.
JAL, what do you want me to say? I don't know what I'm meant to say.
JAL, look at me.
look, I was perfectly happy killing myself.
right, but then you asked me to try...
and for the first time in my life it felt like someone actually gave a shit.
and that person was worth trying for. And now l'd...
I'd fucking make the world record biggest sandwich if you asked me to.
I'd kick old grannies in the tits. I'd fill the rivers with Panda Pops.
stop.
I fucked up big time.
I'm more than sorry.
I love you, jal.
you're my whole world.
now you've got snot on your face.
I'm going to the job Centre.
wait for me?
let me see, Chris. Chris Miles?
Ah, just a minute...
Ah, good.
Chris. In life, we're all walking down a path.
and when that path lacks direction, that's when people get lost.
and we don't like lost people, because no-one should get left behind. Are you following me?
I'm a bit lost.
so glad we agree.
I'm afraid you can't take your exams here.
are you saying I'm being expelled?
I prefer the term "no longer permanently affiliated."
Why?
it's less discouraging.
no. Why am I being kicked out?
let's take a look, shall we?
the nurse's office.
three days ago. - I had a headache.
are you peeing on the science block? - Nope.
that's my desk. - That's not even me.
Ah, this is invasion of privacy!
I'll cut to the chase.
we've no coursework from you and the exams are about to start. You're a shit student.
your inevitably shit results will affect my averages, and then I'll be swimming in a river of shit and I didn't pack a snorkel.
we'll send you a letter saying when you have to leave your student flat.
look, this isn't right... just...
Wah-wah!
welcome to the real world.
come on, Chris.
wanna hear a joke? What do you call nacho cheese?
Oh, shit. I got that wrong.
how does that nacho cheese joke go?
right...
right. OK. Bye!
what do you call cheese that doesn't belong to you?
nacho cheese?
have you heard it before?
I've got nothing, absolutely nothing.
it's not all that bad.
I've been kicked out of college,
I'm homeless and I'm never going to see Angie ever again.
Oh, dry your eyes, Princess.
huh?
maybe you should stop being such a pussy and get off your arse and go do something about it.
Oh, fuck it.
right. Saying "fuck it" works for you, then?
not really.
then maybe you should, you know, try.
I do try!
don't l?
No!
that's all you ever say - no.
no way! - Ah-ha! See? There you go.
always saying no. No to pills, to parties... to me putting my hand on your gooch.
OK. OK. So let's make a deal.
I'll start saying "yes," and you stop saying "fuck it."
I'm gonna have to have that in writing, I'm afraid. Use your pen.
who says l've got a pen?
will you buy me a falafel?
Yes.
bollocks.
so, Derek, let's see what we've got left.
slough Metropolitan University, Abergavenny tech,
cambridge Ringroad University...
come in!
bad time?
Derek needs to go away, have a nice sit down and consider his UCAS options.
right, l've been to the job Centre, yeah...
and they're a bit...
well, they're all just fu... fuddy-duddies.
Yeah! They are fuddy-duddies.
right. they're like, "just queue up here, fill in this box here, "don't steal that." It's a load of cra...
cranberry juice! Do you want cranberry juice?
Thanks.
erm...
anyway, yeah, there's one lady there, l've never met such a big fat bi...
biscuit! Do you want a biscuit?
how can I help?
well, I was thinking.
seeing as you're a careers officer... . I thought you could... you know... . help me get a job.
Oh! yeah! totally!
yeah? Fucking ace!
Chris! Swearing.
Oh...
let's get you a job!
what happened, Chris?
there's loads of these Chinese lads flipping burgers there.
me and Han Li were having a spliff break, and then Paul, the shift manager, comes along.
and she said, "you can't do that."
why not? It's pucking hard getting people to talk to you.
I mean child abuse, it's a bit depressing. So my theory was, reel them in with the free porn, then get to the serious stuff.
so I said, "Why can't people bring their own glasses to the bar??
no wonder this country's turning obese.
but Morris said that was the job, and if I didn't like it, I could puck off.
so I told him he was a pitty boss and a pastard and he could pucking shove his pub polo up his pap's-eye, stupid prick.
I think one slipped through there, Chris.
stupid punt.
what are you going to do?
do you remember them colouring-in books when you were little, Jose?
I hated them.
if I'm gonna do a picture of a house, I don't want someone else telling me what it should look like, know what I mean?
I hate this conformist, repressive society and its stupid culture of conformity, right.
you know, everybody listens to the same plastic music and does the same plastic job, and dresses the same plastic way.
I know, man. I know. totally.
I mean, you're cool because you've got drugs.
but most people just haven't got a clue how they come across.
murmur OF AGREEMENT. Yeah, man. Yeah, that's right.
look at this guy. He is so mainstream.
I mean, nobody thinks for themselves any more.
individuality is dead.
originality is a dirty word.
I mean, the only original thing left to do is get totally fucking wasted.
like us. - Go for it, man.
what are you doing?
Shotguns! you gotta try this.
what's up with your hair?
Why? Don't you like it?
no. No, no, no. It's fine. Really.
right. Enough bollocks.
time to get drunk.
your turn.
come on, let's party. Man like me don't even like beer but I'm brap-brap-brapping this all day, blood.
brap brap brap.
OK. Yes.
brap brap brap!
fuck off!
try again.
No!
what was that? No?
I don't have to say yes to everything. - Um, I think you do.
one, two, three, four... - Yo, that guy's hat is nang!
his hat game is strong.
why don't you go get his hat for An? - What?
go get his hat. Go on.
easy peasy.
what?
Oh, my God! It's Cassie!
so what happened in Scotland? Did you eat loads of deep-fried shit?
did you get me a kilt?
not an actual deep-fried shit. But, you know.
so how was it?
Oh, it was just... Iife.
but I want to hear all your gossip.
when did you two first get together, by the way?
by his hospital bed?
huh?
don't you know?
lovely Sid and lovely Michelle are fucking.
we're not... Not in the way you're thinking, anyway.
don't lie, Sid.
I know your dad's dead, but you can't just go around doing whatever you want.
what's going on?
Cassie just said that Sid and Michelle are doing it.
but tony didn't know. And neither did l.
or Chris. Or Maxxie. Or you. Probably.
but, hey. Hey, Cassie's back! Woo!
listen, Jal... - Why didn't you tell me?
it's awkward.
if you can't talk to your best mate about it, then... maybe it's not awkward but completely fucking shit.
do you want to get out of here?
it's beautiful here.
that was mental, what you did tonight.
brilliant mental.
yeses are good.
Yeah. Yeses are good.
don't forget your side.
Oh, I haven't. I made 50 quid off that powder tonight so, er, life's looking up.
where you going?
that's cheating. I hate cheats, Chris. My dad's a cheat.
what you doing?
play the game, Chris.
I am.
there was a note on your door.
What'd it say?
you've got to leave today.
shit. Better pack my stuff up, then.
is that it?
where are you staying?
Oh, you know.
nowhere.
it's fine.
see you round, Cass.
your CV is... unusual.
we don't get many written on cigarette packets.
I like to recycle.
by a few of your GCSE subjects, you've put a question mark.
I wasn't sure if they counted. - Why not?
I achieved fail grades.
I see.
so, I'm looking for a trainee.
somebody good with people, a talker.
well, I'm... I'm a talker. I mean, l've been talking for...
well, I don't know how long exactly, but years.
and I know loads of words as well.
like apivorous, for example.
what's that?
someone who eat bees.
OK. Er... A little test.
sell me this cup of tea.
um...
right. OK. Tea. It's...
shit. Er...
right...
would you like to buy this mug of tea?
no, thanks.
that's an interesting tie, can l...? Do you mind if I have a little?
Ahh! Ahh!
sure I can't offer you that tea?
here!
right. Fair enough. Just a teeny note.
that won't work with houses, OK?
Yeah, OK.
everyone, this is Chris, the new trainee.
I'll have the papers sent straight over. Bye-bye.
brazil cara-a-a ha-a!
Yabba doo-doo.
and Jon.
the sales table.
I'll let you get your bearings.
so what do you get if you win, then? A pack of chocolate buttons?
don't be stupid.
you get a balloon.
looks like you're not doing too well there, mate.
Yeah, well, first day.
PAH! That's what they all say.
Chris, is it?
Yeah. - Let me give you a bit of advice, Chris.
I'm the Sir Alec round here, yeah?
even if you signed Rooney, Ronaldo, Wright-Philips, Adebayor, you wouldn't have the balls to get above me.
I wouldn't sell you Rooney or Ronaldo, anyway.
or Wright-Philips.
or Adebayor. yeah?
not really that into football, so...
Hah! Poof!
Mrs Smith? Hi there.
Yes, looking good for you.
so as I was saying earlier, the kitchen is a real deal maker.
Wow.
if I could afford a kitchen like this, my wife would never have left me.
and in here particularly, we've got huge amounts of LSD.
it's not what you're thinking, madam.
light, space and drawers.
if you're still humming and hawing,
Iet me tell you a little secret.
the owners'll accept 20 below the asking. Have we got a deal?
I think we do.
Thanks.
OK, this next place has been on the market for about a year.
it's spatially challenged so it's a little tricky to rent.
ball's in your court. Don't worry, it just needs the right patter.
just, er, wait till you see the kitchen.
it's a real deal maker.
if I could afford a place like this, my wife might never have left me!
Oh.
sorry. Watch your, er... yeah.
Yeah, watch your feet.
so this place is great for doing LSD.
no, no.
light.
space.
and drawers.
garden.
er, tell you a secret?
what do you think? Look, we've got electric lights.
on and off. We've got luxury radiators.
er... We've got, like, four plug sockets!
I mean, imagine, who'd need that many? Like, Puff Daddy or someone.
well, la-di-da.
I mean, sure, it needs some stuff.
but structurally, it's...
right, you dozy mare. Get your fucking knickers off!
So...you've got a job and a flat in one day.
Yes, I did.
I think that's playing the game.
Yes, it is.
I think you deserve a reward.
no?
that word's banned.
reward me.
what? Oh.
Oh. Wow.
thanks for letting me stay, Chris.
that's OK.
just for a bit, yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, jal. Have I shown you the bedroom?
we're gonna have some mad fun in here, eh, jal?
Yeah. We will.
Yeah, there's gonna be pills, and pucking and pillows.
lots of pillows...
Chris and jal.
jal and Chris.
more couples.
more and more couples.
have you ever been in love?
I don't think so.
do you want me to describe it to you?
OK.
do you remember when you rode with me in the ambulance after I tried to kill myself?
of course.
that's what love feels like.
we can arrange that, Mrs Collins. HE MOUtHS yeah... May I say I'll be sorry not to be speaking to you every day?
that's right. yeah.
Yeah, sure, sure.
I'll call your solicitor first thing in the morning about completion.
can I have a word?
that's right. Oh, that's marvellous.
many thanks. Bye-bye.
G-o-o-o-o...
it's just you've... you've not sold anything yet.
you've been here a while now and...
no, no, I understand.
if there's anything I can do to help, just let me know.
a muzzle, maybe?
he does sell properties, son.
fuck off out of here, you little prick.
thanks for the duvet cover.
that's OK. - you know when you were little, did you ever use to unbutton the covers and get inside?
when you were young, did you ever read the very Hungry Caterpillar?
it's a classic.
it's about this caterpillar, yeah, and he eats a load of stuff, and then he gets in a cocoon and becomes a butterfly.

and this is the best way that I can explain.
this is how it started for me.
it was good.
then things started going wrong.
then someone else escaped.
the gravity holding us together was gone.
we were floating in space.
it's kinda easy when you've got nothing, because... nothing can't be taken away from you.
but I don't want nothing any more.
is that it? Are you the only person in the world that's been let down?
the only one that's been hurt, abandoned.
are you?
so what gives you the right to act like you are?
Jal...can't you forgive me?
no.
JAL. Don't you understand? I wanna...
make a new fucking pact that means nothing to you?
Yeah. Let's do that.
let's build something. And we'll tear it down.
fuck it. Come on... Come on. Say it! Build something. Tear it down!
you're not who I thought you were.
you're an empty, poisonous smile.
JAL, what do you want me to say? I don't know what I'm meant to say.
JAL, look at me.
look, I was perfectly happy killing myself.
right, but then you asked me to try...
and for the first time in my life it felt like someone actually gave a shit.
and that person was worth trying for. And now l'd...
I'd fucking make the world record biggest sandwich if you asked me to.
I'd kick old grannies in the tits. I'd fill the rivers with Panda Pops.
stop.
I fucked up big time.
I'm more than sorry.
I love you, jal.
you're my whole world.
now you've got snot on your face.
I'm going to the job Centre.
wait for me?
blind date [Man Narrating] There's no doubt that when I was a kid...
I was what you would call... different.
Yup. That's me, Danny Valdessecchi...
followed by my loving family. - [Bellowing]
they were always trying to help...
always trying to save me from myself.
[Clamoring] - Oh, sweetie!
are you okay, sweetie?
he's not moving. - Sweetie, talk to me. Are you all right?
[Child] He looks like roadkill. - I'm okay.
way to go, asshole. - Lorenzo!
[Narrating] My mom was the kind of person whose love could kill you if you weren't careful.
I guess she blames herself because I was born three months premature.
have a good day, huh? Okay. - Mom!
but I was just in a hurry to get out.
I'm always in a hurry.
Hi, Danny. - Hi.
[Laughing] - Pull! Pull!
Danny, switch your hands. - Dad, can I hit?
no. It's Danny's turn. Here we go. All right?
I'm gonna pull this thing out of the ball.
[beeping] - It's gonna make that noise. When you hear it, whack it.
swing! - [Beeping Continues]
you suck. - I can do it.
get off of me. - [Danny Narrating] My dad was cool.
he never worried like my mom.
he knew I didn't want to go to blind school...
so he sent me to normal school, and he let me and my brother... - [Horn Blowing] visit him at work.
"- Help! There's a blind kid driving the train!
Larry, my brother...
only two years older than me, was a boy with a mission.
[Shouting] - He took it upon himself at an early age...
to teach me about life.
come on, Danny. - [Girl] Don't do it.
you're gonna love it. - Remember the last time?
you keep out of this. This candy's not for little girls.
this candy's only for men.
come on, Danny. Take a piece.
take it! - [Laughing]
No! - It's dog shit again.
[Narrating] And as we grew up, Larry's life lessons continued. - [TV: Woman Moaning]
Larry, what's happening?
is she dying? - [Moaning Continues]
it's your mom. - Shoot.
Lorenzo! [Speaking Italian]
and in front of Danny.
what's the problem? He can't see nothin'. - God can see!
[Danny Narrating] Needless to say that by the time I was a young man...
I needed help.
[Woman] Try to be more specific, Danny.
why do you think you feel this way?
uh, l-I guess I'm just curious.
you know? [Chuckles]
I mean, I run my fingers over my face...
but that tells me shit about how I look.
and that matters to you, does it? - Sure. Yeah. Of course it does.
you know, even Marie's got these friends, and they come by...
and she's 14 years old.
you know, these girls freak me out.
I wanna know that girls are attracted to me...
and don't just feel sorry for me
aren't giving me pity.
I feel like I'm a 12-year-old trapped in a 22-year-old body.
you know? It's perfect. [Laughs]
I'm a 22-year-old blind virgin...
who doesn't know a thing about girls.
I at least wanna know that I don't look like some kind of monster.
[Whispering] Oh, believe me, Danny...
you don't look like a monster.
doc, are you naked again?
Mm.
I'm sorry, Danny.
Aw, Doc, you promised you weren't gonna do that anymore.
[Stammering] It's something - A little problem. I'm working on it.
doc, you're one of the smartest people I know...
but you might be crazier than most of your patients.
it's just that sometimes I just feel this need to break out.
to be free. To be who I really am. I'm sorry, Danny.
it will never happen again. I promise.
you said that last time. - I know. I know.
and I'll probably say it again.
you're a kook, you know that? But I love you.
Yup. Yup.
so. Where were we?
[Danny Narrating] Okay, so apart from the fact...
that I got this problem with women...
I'm handling things pretty well.
[Together] Hiya, Danny. - Hi, girls.
he's so cute.
Danny? Danny. - Yeah, Mom?
come on in. Your father wants to talk to you.
sit down.
don't you want to sit down?
no. What's up?
I say go for it, Danny. - Go for what?
it's too dangerous. - Ma.
how could you do this to me?
how could I do what to you? What are you talking about?
but it's Danny's big chance. - It's out of the question.
does somebody wanna fill me in on what we're talkin' about?
you stay out of it. - All right, shut up. Shut up.
all of you, shut up. - [Opera Continues]
Danny, we got a call from a doctor. Doctor-What was his name?
Perkins. - That wasn't it.
Yeah, it was Perkins. - No, it wasn't. It was something else.
[Mother] You said it was- - It's Perkins.
a Dr. Perkins.
he said you were maybe gonna volunteer...
for some sort of experimental operation.
maybe it can make you see.
what's goin' on here? How come you never said nothin'?
I didn't say anything because I haven't volunteered for anything yet.
you don't talk to me about these things anymore? - It's not a big deal.
Yes, this is a very big deal. What's goin' on?
it's not gonna happen. There are risks. You don't know. There could be problems.
mom, you wanna let him make up his mind for once in his life?
ma, what if he could see? - Exactly. What if he can see?
you are a guinea, not a guinea pig.
Oh, where you goin'? Come back here.
[Chattering] - This is exactly why I didn't want to say anything.
I didn't want to worry you, Ma. I didn't want to get everybody's hopes up either.
you know, I don't even know if I wanna go through with this yet.
Danny, it's your call.
whatever you decide to do...
we're all behind you. - I know. I know.
right?
well, I'm hungry. Ma, how about some dinner?
[Man On TV] Where I'm going, you can't follow. What I've got to do, you can't be any part of.
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble...
but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people...
[Mouthing Words] - Don't amount to a hill ofbeans in this crazy world.
here's looking at you, kid.
[Man] Yo, D!
yo, Danny boy!
Danny boy!
Jay, what's up?
Hey, man, I got some ballers down at the court who swear they got game.
so what do you think? Wanna make some bucks? - Yeah. Let's do it.
Danny. Are you nuts? Danny, what are you doing?
Danny! Yo! Whoo.
that's it. I'm convinced. You are the Batman.
how's your sonar? - Good. Let's do it.
[Danny] Make some money? - [Jay] Easy.
Hey! Hey, you guys.
this is the guy I was telling you about.
and like I said, if he wins, you guys gotta pay five to one.
it's only fair. - How's he gonna know where the hoop is?
what are you, the handicap police?
take a shot. Show 'em.
bring it, fellas. Let's try 10 bucks.
ten bucks? - That's 50 bucks if he wins.
Hey, man, he's blind as a bat. We got this.
ready? - Don't worry about it. It's easy money.
all right. Let me see the ball.
Stevie Wonder's gotta shoot first.
what? - Follow the voice.
[Jay] Right here.
Oh!
Danny, follow the voice. That-a-boy.
Oh, goodness. Three times in a row?
now, that was net, but it's still good.
Oh, you guys got a "H. "
poetry in motion.
[Man Groans] - [Jay] Oh! You got an "O. "
backboard. You got an "R. "
come on! - Nothing but net.
you guys got an "S. '" - [Man] That was net, wasn't it?
don't hurt 'em. - [Man Groans]
[Jay] Oh! Almost. "E."
you guys lose. Pay up. Here we go.
now we're talking. - Let's go.
fifty bucks, man. You are amazing. - Fifty bucks!
of course I am. - You're gonna have most of my tuition paid.
think of it as like a basketball scholarship. - I hear that, man.
how about you? What's goin' on with that night law school thing?
got my first class comin' up. - Really? Ready?
of course I am, man. - That-a-boy.
[Family] Oh!
[Larry] I'm here to eat, please. - Lucia, the meats!
all right. - I'm hungry here.
Gina said if you ask her out, she'll say yes.
hit me. Hit me. - [Danny] I don't think so.
you're so strange. How come you never want to go out with my friends?
leave your brother alone. - Because they're 14, Marie.
what could these girls offer him? - What could these
the time of his life, Ma. That's what they could offer him.
not everyone is like you, Lorenzo. - That's what you think.
at least now you're in your own apartment, you don't bring 'em here anymore.
[Larry Laughing] Thank God. - See? This is why I love comin' over here.
Danny, do you remember that girl? Remember? Ass like a coconut, huh?
my God. - She's layin'in the bathtub.
he has no idea. He turns on the water.
she almost has a heart attack. - [Father] Basta.
we're eatin'. What's the matter with you? - Sorry. Marie, forgive me.
so, Danny, when are you gonna tell us more about this operation?
let me volunteer first, Pop. What's the hurry?
the doctor said family is important.
Yeah, Ma, it's important to stay out of it.
to give support. - Maybe tomorrow we can drive you there.
no, it's all right. Jay's giving me a ride. - Oh, Jay's got wheels now. Huh?
let go of my ears.
[Continues] - Think that's funny?
Oh, shit!
come on! - Yeah, buddy.
[Continues] - Here it is.
come on. - Whoo!
hold on. Hold on. Whoa. Hey! Whoa!
Whoa! Danny, what are you doin'?
it's like Six Flags, man.
okay! Move! Whoa!
[Laughs] - Here we are. Hold on, Danny.
all right. - [Fades]
Oh! - Made it.
nice wheels, man. - Chicks dig it.
where you at? - [Ends]
Hey, you gonna be all right to make it home? - Yeah.
all right, buddy. Have a good one, all right? - All right, bud.
four-eyes. - Hey, quit it. No name calling.
you promised you'd be good.
[Woman] I thought you told Mom...
you were gonna behave while she was gone.
are you okay? - I'm fine.
[Baby Crying] - No!
Where's Doris? - Honey
why don't you get back? - Hey! Where's Doris?
look, what do you want? Can't you see I'm busy? - No.
I can't see that you're busy. Can't you see that I'm fuckin' blind?
he said the "B" word. He said the "B" word.
what happened to Doris? - She's on vacation.
that's too bad. I liked her.
what are you starin' at?
the signal from the camera, which is mounted on the glasses...
goes directly to a chip...
which is implanted in the visual cortex of the brain.
so my eyes are not a part of the process then? - Absolutely.
the camera bypasses them. But, Danny, remember, we don't see with our eyes.
we see with our brains.
now, I'd like to tell you...
that if the operation is successful...
you would be able to see like everyone else.
well, that's not going to happen.
the best you could hope for...
is a fuzzy black-and-white image.
maybe it'll be good enough to keep from bumping into things.
maybe it'll be enough to see a face.
yeah?
Oh. Thank you. Yes, please.
that's Dr. Evans. I've asked her to join us.
I know you know her. You feel comfortable with her.
she's going to be a vital member of the team.
Dr. Evans.
Oh. Dr. Perkins.
Amarige. - Oh. [Chuckles]
Yes, Danny, that's right. That's
it's my new scent.
do you like it? - Yeah. Yeah, it suits you.
what do you think, Doc?
smells good.
Dr. Evans is going to be responsible...
for putting together the psychological reports...
of all the potential candidates for this operation.
I got no problem with that. - Good.
so then all we really need to know...
is that if the F.D.A. gives us the green light...
can we put you down as a potential candidate?
[Dr. Evans] Oh, you can take your time, Danny.
I mean, this is a very important decision.
so, uh, do you have someone meeting you?
no. I'll get a cab if you can point me in the right direction.
you know how to get out of the building? - Got it memorized, Doc.
okay, you hang to the left, go about 15 paces.
you should reach the street, and a cab should be waiting there.
sounds good. - Okay.
I can take him, Dr. Perkins. I'm leaving now.
I think I can manage, Doris. - The name's Leeza.
why doesn't he use his cane?
because he doesn't think of himself as blind.
good night, Doris.
good night, Danny.
taxi.
yo!
Leeza, you're late.
they're waiting for you. - [Gasps] Arvind's here.
and Mr. Bhat. - I'm sorry. I forgot.
I don't think you should say that to your future husband.
let me look at you. Go, go, go. Go.
you're in big trouble. - Oh, take a hike, Ravi
or I'll tell them what I found under your bed.
Arvind. Hey. - Hey.
I'm sorry I'm late. - It's okay.
I apologize for keeping you waiting.
[Speaking Foreign Language] - What?
do you not speak English? - Of course I speak English.
I see your daughter does not follow our traditions of respect for elders and punctuality.
- For my daughter, punctuality is an aspiration.
dad. - Her respect has to be earned.
[Woman] I guess so.
I took that class last semester.
watch it, man. That's my computer.
I'm sorry. I didn't see it.
just pick it up and give it to me. - Relax. I'm looking for it.
just give it back. - [Man] He's blind.
[Larry] So they know you're blind. They were gonna find out sooner or later.
it's none of their business.
besides the fact he was rude. I should have smacked his face.
you didn't tell me he was rude to you. - Yeah. He was rude.
you want me to turn around? I'll beat the shit out of him.
no, killer. Maybe later. - [Woman, Muffled] All right.
all right. Okay.
okay. Christ! - [Rhythmic Thumping]
Larry, is there someone in the back?
Yeah. Suzie's in the back.
who's Suzie? - Um, hmm
[Suzie Continues, indistinct] - Danny, Suzie's a hooker.
and she's in the back with someone? - Yes, she is.
Aw, Jesus. What's goin' on?
when I haven't got a booking...
I've been renting out the car to my lady friends...
and they take care of the business in the back with their johns.
now, the Johns
they have to pay an extra 50, 'cause that's classified as kinky sex.
that extra 50 goes to the house
yours truly. - Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm. Hey, you wanna go get something to eat, man?
this soundtrack's making me hungry.
so are you gonna go through with this surgery or operation, or what?
I don't know.
what do you have to lose, huh?
half my brain. - Half your brain? What do you mean?
I told you, they have to implant this chip in my brain.
this is, like, brain surgery?
[Chuckles] Yes, genius, like brain surgery.
look at you. You're a slob. - What are you doin'?
get out of here with that. - You're makin' a mess.
filthy. - Touch your face.
so this might have, like, a significant "oops" factor, huh?
what? - "Oops. We lost the happy childhood memories. Sorry.
Mmm. Exactly. - What's the upside?
well, they said if it works
and it's like the mother of all if - they can get a, uh...
fuzzy black-and-white image.
no, no, no. We don't want anything less than full-blown high-definition color.
you know? Digital.
thank you.
Denver. - It was Dallas.
he killed a man in Dallas just to see if he was dead. - "Watch him die.
Larry? Excuse me. - Listen to the song!
this gentleman has a favor to ask you.
photo. - Photo, yeah. Photo.
Oh, you want me to take a picture. Sure. All right. - Okay.
all right, here we go. Ready? - Don't press the boobs, sweetie.
one, two, three.
there we go. - Thank you, Larry.
thank you. Thank you.
Whoo. Thank you.
thank you, sweetheart.
[Clears Throat] Who's your friend?
Oh, Suzie. This is my brother, Danny.
get out of town. - That's him.
well! Have you told your brother how handsome he is?
I haven't today. - Well, tell him.
Hey, Danny. You're gorgeous.
[Laughs] Well, you are.
thank you.
anytime that you want to go...
in the back of your brother's limo with me...
you just let me know.
okay? No charge, of course.
will do. - [Laughing] Will do.
there you go. He's a charmer. - All righty.
okay, you boys. - All right, you little sex kitten.
y'all have a great night. - Hey, I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, I'll see you, hot stuff. - Damn right. Mmm.
Ooh. That's my kind of woman.
she just made you an offer you can't refuse.
Oh, stop it.
Hey, Danny, you know what? Don't-Don't bullshit me. Watch your step.
you know, we both know you haven't done it.
and at your age it's not natural, man.
you could start to build up all kinds of pressure...
and let's not forget about your prostate.
okay? No, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on.
okay. This is why old guys have all those problems- No sex.
do you think the fact that I haven't had a relationship hasn't been on my mind?
I'm not talking about a relationship.
I'm talkin' about sex.
Danny, you do wanna do it with a woman, right?
Yes, of course I do. - All right. I just had to ask, all right?
you gave me a little bit of a heart-stopper there for a second.
look, you don't understand, Larry.
I don't want something cheap. I'm lookin' for the real thing.
fine. I'll set you up with one nice girl.
I don't want anything arranged either. I don't want a hooker.
Danny, okay. No hookers. I'll find a good girl for you.
no, I don't think so. We've been through this before.
you know what I think? I think you're scared.
bullshit. - Afraid of a little vagina?
shut your mouth. - Scared of the vagina.
[Danny] It's gotta be a real date.
you know, dinner and everything. - Yeah.
and then, you know, take her back to my place.
if we feel something for each other...
and she wants to do it, then we'll do it.
only if she wants to do it. - Yeah.
Yeah, Danny, that's how it usually works.
otherwise they arrest you and charge you with rape.
[Laughing] - What are you laughing at?
what? - I'm just thinking it would be like a real blind date.
Danny, really, after 22 years you just thought of that joke?
Oh, my God. - Do me a favor. Don't
can you turn the window down, please? You're still wearing that cologne?
[Larry] You don't like that? Patchouli.
are you breakin'my balls or you really don't like that?
so who is she? - [Pop, indistinct]
I don't know. Mandy someone.
do you trust Larry? What if she's, like, a dog?
okay. That's good. Stand up.
you look good. - Yeah.
I like the hair. - Yeah.
Oh, what is this now? - Huh?
how does he look? - How do I look?
you look like a jackass, Danny. - What? He looks good.
did you do this? - Yeah.
what? - We gotta change that shirt.
what's wrong with the shirt? - Nothing's wrong with his shirt.
a lot is wrong with that shirt.
we don't need another Tony Soprano in our house.
do not say anything bad about Tony Soprano.
Larry, you can leave now. - Guys, guys, the shirt. The shirt-What's wrong?
Larry? - Out.
I was just trying to help.
Larry, what is it? What is it?
what's wrong with it? - It's very loud.
okay, well, pick another one.
this is a nice shirt. I bought you this shirt.
come on! Come on, come on.
so how do you know her? - She's a friend of a friend.
unbelievable. - What? I'm not done yet, Danny.
you make a blood oath that she isn't a dog, or I stay.
are you kidding me? - No.
you don't trust me anymore? - In one word, no.
and why not? - Are you forgetting Graziella Morino in the 10th grade?
gorilla Morino? - Yeah.
some people thought that girl was hot.
she smelled like a shaggy carpet. Make the oath or I stay.
fine. I'll make your stupid oath. - Go ahead.
Aw, God, that hurts!
sharp edge, Larry. - All right.
no, no, no.
a blood oath is when we both cut ourselves. - Uh-uh.
Yeah, that's what it is. - No.
you cut yourself. - Cut yourself.
you do it first. - Do it.
no. - Cut yourself.
are you gonna do it? - [Laughing] No.
then let's get out of here. - Fine.
this is ridiculous. Come on.
okay, Mandy, it's my pleasure...
to introduce you to my brother, Danny.
very nice to meet you. [Chuckles] - [Chuckles]
after you.
[Voice Breaking] Oh, you poor man.
please. - [Crying]
come on.
I'm so sorry. - No, no. No, no, no.
I'm sure you'll feel much better after we get some food.
I'm sure. - Okay.
okay. All right. [Sniffling]
[Chuckles] - So you're really blind?
Yes. - [Blubbering]
[Whimpering] - Signorina.
look, please - please stop crying.
stop it.
you know, just think - I've been like this since I was born.
I don't know any differently. - How brave.
why don't we talk about you? How's that?
we'll talk about you. Tell me something about yourself.
there's not much to tell, really.
I'm 25 years old, and I work as a secretary.
people think I look like Meryl Streep. [Laughing]
but you'll never know what Meryl Streep looks like.
[sobbing] Oh, God! Oh, God!
I think the next one shouldn't be so sensitive.
evening. - [Man] Right this way, sir.
get out of my way, asshole. Can't you see he's blind?
look what you did.
Danny, come here, honey. Let me help you.
all right. [Grunts] - Okay. Put me down.
put me down. Put me down!
I can walk.
I was just tryin' to help.
you gonna get the door or what, Tupac? Let's go.
Yes. I'm on it. - Larry. Larry.
there you go. - Thank you.
very welcome. - Ladies first?
I'm sorry. - I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.
go ahead.
Cheers, baby.
so, Danny, tell me.
you a physical guy? Like to do some workin' out?
uh, sure. - What do you press?
fifty pounds, maybe. - I like that. I like a man with a sense of humor.
mama's gonna help you out.
there you go. - You know
I can- I can eat on my own. It's fine.
Hey, I'm just trying to create some chemistry, baby.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll take ya. - I-I-I can walk.
Oh, Mama hasn't had action like this in weeks. I'm hungry. Let's go.
Oh, God. - Danny boy!
Oh, my God. - Mama's here!
Danny? Danny! - Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
you better get your ass in here. She's crazy.
Danny, open this door! Danny!
Signora, I must ask you to leave.
Oh, don't "signora'"me, Pablo.
you just better hold onto your squirrel before he loses his nuts.
Signora, take your time. Can I get you something to drink?
an espresso, perhaps? - Out.
just get in here. - Danny? Danny?
Oh, God! Get in here! - You ever done it in a bathroom, Danny?
[Woman Shouting, Pounding] - I just wanna meet a normal woman.
damn it! I'm gonna get you!
honey, you do not cross Big Mama!
I've been looking so forward to this night... - Yeah.
that I brought a little something along with me as a surprise.
all right.
Danny, I wanna feel the way that you feel.
I wanna see the things that you see.
I wanna be as one with you, Danny.
look. I have a blindfold.
I can see the blackness. - Larry!
[Indistinct Conversations] - Doris still on vacation?
you're very good at this, aren't you?
I've got great insight.
I'll tell him you're here.
[Dr. Evans] This is a very big decision, Danny.
are you sure you want to do it? - Yeah. Sure, I am.
it's very brave of you, Danny.
it's not like I'm volunteering for a suicide mission here, is it?
no. No, uh
what I meant to say was...
neurosurgery is never without risks...
and it would be wrong of me to say otherwise. - Well, then what are the risks?
we really don't know.
[Whispering] Help.
l- I think that what Dr. Perkins is trying to say is that...
you're very courageous to try something...
that has not been done very often.
Oh, I can take Mr. Valdessecchi to a cab, Doctor
if he wants. - Sure.
[Danny] He told me that - Oh, there you go.
there's always risks with brain surgery, but
I figure, what the hell. You gotta be brave sometime.
sure, you gotta be brave, but it's not so smart to walk around without a cane. Step.
Thanks, Mom. - You're welcome.
you're in luck. Here's a cab.
uh, got a confession to make.
I don't really need a cab.
I just kind of wanted to talk with you a while.
Oh. Um, that's very sweet.
my brother Larry's coming to pick me up.
he, um, runs a limo service.
larry's, uh - Larry's Limos. - Oh.
he's not here yet. - How can you tell?
[Chuckles] If Larry were here, trust me, you'd know it.
but anyway, when he comes, maybe we can give you a ride?
Oh, um, thanks, but I'd better not.
and my bus is here, so I'd better go.
Yeah. Okay. - Okay.
Bye. - Okay.
see you soon.
Thanks, Mom. - Thank you.
if she brings us any more food...
we can open our own restaurant. - We don't have to.
after we get married, we're gonna take over this one.
it's all been discussed.
Oh. And... what else has been discussed?
that you'll run this place until we start having kids.
and have you discussed when that is gonna be?
well, the sooner the better, and, um
[Whispering] I say we start practicing now.
arvind, what if I don't want to run this restaurant?
what if I want to go to medical school?
what?
Oh, God. Ravi.
sorry. [Clears Throat]
you know, the final choice isn't going to be made on ophthalmic criteria.
it's probably going to be made on a candidate's personality.
his ability to cope with the success or failure of the operation.
Danny. Do you want to join me for lunch?
I go to the park across the road.
I got turkey and cheese.
do you have any shrimp?
no. - All right.
[Boys Shouting] - My brother, Larry - when I was a kid told me that kids were supposed to run free in the park...
cause that's what parks are for.
but he didn't tell me about trees.
I really hate trees. - [Laughs]
like, a lot.
you wanna take a walk?
wait a minute. You want me to follow you?
no, you lead. Just give me your shoulder. - All right.
we're taking these. - Okay.
where are we going? - You like baseball?
I don't know. I've never been. - You've never been?
no. - God, you'd love it.
it's a beautiful game.
I mean, you've got the smell of the grass.
you've got the sound of the ball when it gets crushed.
there's nothing like it. - Maybe I should go some time.
has Dr. Perkins talked to you about the operation?
Yeah. He said the final choice will be based on personality.
[Laughing] You're not gonna have a problem there.
I don't know. I'm not so sure about that.
Danny, I've worked with a lot of visually impaired people...
and I can honestly say I've never met anyone like you.
what do you mean? - Well
it's this feeling you give to other people.
and you don't use your cane.
I use my cane. - Not always.
and that's stupid and dangerous and...
also kind of brave.
have you ever thought of a guide dog? - Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I love dogs. I've just got this little problem with dog shit.
I guess what I'm trying to tell you is you're okay.
think I'm okay enough to have dinner with me?
okay.
who are these friends you're going out with?
just friends from the hospital, Mom. Bye!
thank you. - [Danny] Thanks.
I mean, I like that book too.
I mean, I like to read, but I love to watch movies because in movies they don't
they don't describe the trees and the sky...
and the - and the birds and all that stuff.
in movies they just talk. They just talk.
and when I hear someone's voice, I mean, it tells me
it tells me - It tells me so much about people.
like your voice.
your voice tells me that, uh
what? That you have short, dark hair...
and, uh, you have these, uh
you have these big, beautiful dark eyes.
Dr. Perkins could have told you that.
no, it's your voice. I'm telling you, it's your voice.
I mean, your hair - I can tell that it's short...
because I can't hear it swishing around.
although I did take a chance on your eyes, but now I know it's true.
they are - They are, uh, big and beautiful.
well, I figure a lawyer, you know, has got to be able to read people's minds...
and when you're blind that's mostly what you do.
and are you reading my mind?
Yeah, sure. - And?
I can tell that you want to be here...
but there's also something holding you back...
and I don't know what it is.
I think you're gonna be a very good lawyer.
[Slow Pop] - What I'd really like to do is...
go to medical school. - Mm-hmm.
and then join Dr. Perkins' research team.
why can't you? - It's not that simple.
I'm a woman. - [Woman Singing, indistinct]
I noticed. [Chuckles]
and one day I'd like to get married, have a family.
think you could do both?
no.
not without an understanding husband.
hmm.
then you're just gonna have to choose the right one.
that is one fine lady with you, Mr. Valdessecchi.
thank you, James.
I can smell when Mrs. Luciano makes fettuccini from three blocks away.
29
or when they cut grass at the baseball field.
I love your perfume. - [Chuckles]
and your smile.
do you smell that? The blossoms are out early this year.
now you're showing off. - [Laughs]
is there anybody else around? - No, we're alone.
I've had the best night I've ever had.
I just hope it's been half as good for you.
I've had a wonderful time.
all right, thanks.
I'll take care of it, Larry. No problem.
an oil leak now.
so you gonna tell me about it?
she's the most natural person in the whole world.
and she's got the most beautiful smile. [Chuckles]
Danny, how do you know what her smile looks like?
you wouldn't understand. It's- It's the sound of it.
I love the sound of her smile.
so why didn't you take her back to my place last night?
Oh, because not everything's got to come down to sex.
that's true. Money and looks are important too.
Oh, hey, Mike. - [Man] Yeah?
don't forget to clean those footprints off my ceiling.
I got it. - Unbelievable.
what's so unbelievable?
your face. - It's hot.
Hi. - Hey.
they're gorgeous. Thank you.
do you like Humphrey Bogart?
I like Humphrey Bogart.
let's go, kid. - [Giggles]
[Woman] What about us? - We'll always have Paris.
we didn't have. We'd lost it until you came to Casablanca.
we got it back last night.
when I said I would never leave you.
and you never will, but I've got a job to do too.
Danny, I've got to go.
no. Don't go. - [Laughs]
um
Leeza, I've- I've never felt this way for anyone before.
I'll see you soon, okay?
Yeah.
Bye. - Bye.
arvind will take over the business in a few years when I retire.
and with a loyal wife by his side...
he will be well able to provide for his family.
Arvind's ability to provide for his future family...
is in no doubt, because he is Indian.
and there should be no doubt about the loyalty of his future wife either.
I wanna tell you how proud we all are of you, Danny.
first, for getting chosen for this operation...
and second, for having the palle to go through with it.
what does "palle'" mean? - Balls.
stop corrupting Marie. Come on, please.
um, thank you, Pop. Thank you, Larry.
I would just like to say that...
if this thing does work out...
and I can see your faces for the first time...
and I find out you're all too ugly, I'm moving out.
Hey. - Chin-chin.
[Together] Salud!
[Children Chattering] - [Danny] Dr. Perkins says...
if it's successful...
I might be able to see well enough to...
get around.
even identify faces.
I might be able to see your face.
I'll know what you look like.
only a man can cause joy one day and tears the next.
what has Arvind done?
mom, it isn't Arvind.
he's a Hindu?
he's not Indian.
a few years after I came to this country I met this man.
an American.
he was very handsome, like a movie star.
and every time I saw him my heart jumped.
mom. What happened?
Oh, he met a beautiful American girl.
Oh. - Nothing to be sad about.
just thankful. I met your father just after that.
you're my only daughter...
and I love you very much...
but you've made a promise to Arvind.
and only you can decide if you can honor that promise or not.
l-I'm sorry.
I should have told you earlier.
what are you talking about? What is that supposed to mean?
Danny, I've had a wonderful time with you...
and no one's ever made me feel this way...
but I'm engaged to be married.
engaged to be married?
what is that supposed to mean?
L-It means I can't see you anymore.
am I missing something here? L-I don't understand.
l-I'm sorry.
I should have told you earlier.
do you love this guy?
do you? - He's a nice guy, Danny.
that doesn't answer my question. Do you love him?
it's not that simple. There's a lot more to it than that.
just be honest with me.
at the end of the day...
you'd rather be with someone who can see...
instead of some asshole blind guy.
[Larry] Danny, you know, I know what it's like to get dumped. Okay? I understand.
what you gotta do is look at it...
like you're one of these one-in-10 guys, okay?
for every 10 noes that you get...
you're gonna get one yes, okay?
so this no is really just bringing you that much closer to a yes.
you gotta trust me on this, Danny. It's all mathematics.
[Jay] Ready, set
[Ball Beeping] - Pitch!
Whoa! Whoo!
man! That would have been a double for sure.
I smell money, man.
Hey. Hey, hey. - What's up?
so, really, it doesn't bother you...
you know, that I can't see, does it?
Nah. - Even when we were in school and you had to help me?
Ahh. Wait a second. It's those girls you been dating.
I just don't get it, man. - Look, Danny boy.
girls are something you cannot figure out, all right?
if they can't realize that you're a good cat and you got it goin'on, screw 'em.
you're wild, man. Your hormones are jumping up.
come on. Next pitch.
so where are we going?
I just wanted to get some air.
and so does your family.
come on. - Arvind!
Leeza? - It's okay.
you look so beautiful tonight, and I just wanted a little bit of time alone with you.
these pumpkins have been calling out to me all night.
Hello! - Arvind, stop it.
it's okay. We're gonna get married. - [Chattering]
[Chattering] - Stop.
sorry. Arvind.
arvind, I'm sorry.
arvind, look
[Groans] Larry, bar.
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, buddy. - [Grunts]
here. There you go.
pump them out. Good.
need some help? - No, no, no. I got it.
all right. Push through it.
you got it. - Yeah.
one -- That's it.
two -- Good.
good. - Five
[Groaning] - Oh, yeah.
man. - Oh, I'm done.
how'd that one rep treat you? Hmm?
very, very impressive.
Hey, Danny, let's go.
hit the showers. - Yeah.
Yeah.
all right, pick something cool. Think James Dean.
did you mess up my hair?
it looks fine.
come on. - So, who'd Larry fix you up with this time?
[Whistle Blows] - [Man] Pick it up. Right there.
so, Larry tells me you're in the- in the service industry.
that-that's great. What do you do exactly?
[Laughs] The service industry.
I like that. That's-That's a good one.
it begins pretty much the typical way -- boy meets girl.
boy proposes to girl.
boy sees George Michael in his apartment.
boy gets diagnosed with an inoperable brain aneurysm.
you didn't see that coming.
wait, it gets better.
boy meets acupuncturist who's convinced the boy is the 21st centurequivalent of Moses.
but instead of parting seas and smashing tablets, boy must somehow interpret and follow the visions he's having and fix the world one lauit at a time.
needless to say, it's put a bit of a stress on--on, well, everything, but mostly boy's relationship, which is why I'm returning this.
it's a sad story, right?
do you have a receipt, sir?
I told you, I can't find it.
can't you check your records?
either way, you still need proof of purchase.
that'll teach you not to pay retail.
you sure you don't need a ring?
uh, not presently, but when I do, I'll be sure to keep my receipt.
I miss Taylor, Nate.
Ah, it's good to know nothing's changed since you said that five minutes ago.
maybe I did the wrong thing breaking up with her.
allow me to provide some clarity here.
you did you the wrong thing, butt wipe.
if I didn't end it with her, she'd end up miserable, shackled to a crazy person.
and a dweeb, but that is her decision.
get her back before you become even more pathetic than you actually are.
what ithat supposed to mean?
Eli, you are, like, the worst bachelor ever.
instead of hooking up with old girlfriends, of which we know there's not many, you break out the microwave popcorn, and you spend your nights in bed watching reruns of tv movies on the we network.
I'm not in bed.
shows how much you know.
look, I gotta get some sleep.
I got rounds in less than six hours.
help me, Stone.
what did you say? - Nothing.
good night, little brother.
help me, Stone help me, Stone.
Oh, no. - Help me, Stone.
help me, Stone. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no!
help me, Stone. Help me, Stone.
help me, Stone.
No! Get back in the tv!
help me.
help me. Please, Stone. Help me.
he came out of the television.
like that creepy chick in "The Ring"?
Oh, he didn't climb out exactly.
first he was on tv.
then he appeared in my apartment.
man, everybody comes to your apartment-- George Michael, a boys' choir...
I'm a little insulted I haven't been invited.
I'm not inviting them.
I don't even know who this guy is.
does he look familiar? - No.
how am I supposed to help a guy I've never even met
take an ad out in the paper? You know, get a police sketch?
this is clearly a w&s kind of vision.
wait and see.
you've categorized my visions?
look at my herb shelf, dude. I'm a little O.C.D. With the labeling.
now beat it. Have to get into character for my 9: 00.
but - Wait and see
Eli is a remarkable young man.
I thought we dropped the formality of being diplomatic decades ago, Mason.
well, he certainly made for an eventful engagement party.
Taylor's taste in men has always been a few steps beyond my comprehension.
allow me to enlighten.
she loves Eli because she sees you in him
well, your spirit, your intellect, your ginsu-sharp legal mind.
if I didn't know you any better, I'd say you were buttering me up for something.
well, as it turns out, there is a legal matter we've been handling in-house.
but since the E. E.O. C. has allowed the claim to go forward, it's time for me to retain outside counsel.
the E. E.O. C? What's the claim?
discriminatory hiring practices.
the plaintiff is a young lawyer that we interviewed but ultimately didn't hire
I ultimately didn't hire.
so she goes and files a discrimination claim.
he did, actually.
is he gay?
not as far as I know.
sorry, I don't understand. What's he alleging?
racism.
he claims I didn't hire him because he's black.
get away. I'm having a really lousy week.
maybe I can help. My plate's clean.
that's because no one else will work with you.
Oh, come on. What are you working on?
fine. I need restraining order petition.
do you know how to draft one?
Yeah, sure thing. Who are the parties?
I'm seeking the T. R.O. Personally, actually.
Really? Against who?
one Maggie Dekker. That's two k's good morning!
beautiful day, isn't it?
Oh, my god. Someone told you.
I heard from denise in H. R.
but I confirmed with Larry in the tech department.
I was afraid it was too good to be true!
Larry in the tech partment knows that I broke up with Taylor?
does Jordan know?
I'm not sure, but I'd be happy to tell him myself.
let me try his extension.
Patti, I broke up with Taylor because of my aneusm.
Oh, and I thought your condition was a bad thing. - If you told Jordan that, that would be antithetical to my continued employment at this firm.
you're the only guy who could dump the boss's daughter and be worried about getting fired for something else.
you gotta suss out what Taylor told Jordan.
call her assistant.
or you're seeing Jordan at the staff meeting.
why don't you suss it out for yourself?
Mr. Stone.
morning, sir. Fine.
I mean, I'm fine, sir. How are you?
things could be better.
new matter--we're being retained by mason andrews.
the Mason Andrews?
there's only one that I'm aware of.
I need a second chair.
Mr. Stone, you're not volunteering.
I wasn't sure if, uh...
well, I thought under the circumstances...
I'm sure Mr. Andrews would be well-served by such eloquence.
Mr. Stone?
what is it now?
man, I gotta start bringing my camcorder to these meetings.
I think I ate some bad sushi.
it's 10: 00 in the morning.
will you excuse me for a minute?
you have to do something.
I am with a patient right now, Eli.
I'm a patient, too.
not right now, you're not.
you have to write me a prescription for sleeping pills, anxiety medication
beg for taylor's forgiveness and call me in the morning.
Jake, I'm so sorry about that.
Ah, uh, please ignore him, Jake.
this is my little brother who's been attached to my hip since I was 3.
every time I have him removed, he grows back.
it's okay.
nice to meet you.
I'm Jake Mccann.
what's going on with you?
why do you care so much?
the guy just woke up from a coma, for god sakes.
wait, he woke up from a co-- Jake Mccann is coma guy!
you've been treating coma guy!
chen was right. YeahI saw him on "Kimmel" and "Good Morning America." Who is chen?
doesn't matter. Listen, you have to ask him
no, no, he does not need a lawyer, Eli.
he was in a coma. Comas don't just happen by accident.
well, in this case, they do, you know?
he happened to fall off of his roof while he was clang out his gutter.
just ask if he has any legal problems.
if he doesn't, I'll leave you and coma guy alone.
if this ends up in a malpractice suit, I'm gonna kill you, fool.
Where's your representation, Mr. Bennett?
I'm pro se.
I didn't spend three years in law school to pay some guy to do what I can do myself for free.
and what's that-- lose spectacularly?
Matt Dowd, right?
didn't you just get spanked for $5 mil by a lawyer in your own firm?
let's talk about a trial date.
actually, we don't think you want to take this matter to trial.
it's not in your best interest.
I've never met an opposing counsel who's concerned with my interest.
I'm just trying to save you time and rule 11 sanctions for filing a frivolous claim.
the E. E.O. C. gave me go-ahead for this trial, so it might be a little less than frivolous.
be that as it may, a suit like this would make you virtually unemployable in this town.
not if I win it.
which you won't.
what are you gonna do, argue Mason Andrews is prejudiced against African-Americans
that he's prejudiced against himself?
not himself or alone in his current zip code.
it's black folks like me he can't stand.
get back to me about a trial date.
seems pleasant enough.
can't imagine why he'd have a hard time finding a job.
what do you mean, you don't understand?
well, if you haven't figured it out yet, honey, you haven't been listening hard enough.
is that Taylor's assistant?
are you really gon do that every me I finish a call?
is it annoying?
you have no idea. - Good.
find out exactly what Taylor told Jordan, and I'll stop.
ask her yourself.
she's standing right behind you.
Taylor. Uh, what are you doing here?
lunch with dad, actually.
how are you, Patti?
better than I've been in quite some time.
I can explain.
you're nervous about what I might tell my dad, so you dispatched your assistant to pump mine for information.
I guess I don't need to explain.
look, I just stopped by to tell you that
I'm going to the apartment on Thursday to pick up my stuff.
I still have my key, so you don't have to be there to let me in.
for what it's worth, I feel awful...
unbelievably awful.
and you broke up with me...
so you can imagine how I feel.
you call at the worst times, Nate.
it's coma guy.
turns out--and I can't believe I'm saying this-- he does need a lawyer.
Mr. Mccann, my associate Maggie Dekker.
pleased to meet you, coma guy -- Mr. Coma guy
McCann! Mr. Mccann.
don't mind her. She has tourette's.
no, no, it's--it's okay.
ever since "kimmel," I get it everywhere I go, which is kind of ironic since when I went to sleep,
I had no idea who Kimmel was.
must have been hard on your wife.
Yeah, but, uh, she coped by leaving me for my best friend and business partner.
starting to figure out why you want to hire a lawyer.
I already have, actually.
he said I should just take the 10 million that Brooke and Adam are offering me and walk.
wait. $10 million?
after I slipped off the roof, Adam took our start-up public, and it tripled in value.
$10 million's a lot of money.
I don't care about money.
I care about my company, what I built, and I want to get it back.
she got it in the divorce, I'm guessing.
Yeah, it was a pretty sweet deal.
Brooke got my company, and Adam got my wife.
how are you not the most bitter man on earth?
well, who says I'm not?
here I am, sitting down with two more lawyers.
one and a half, actually.
the problem is, if the divorce gave Brooke the company, then it's gonna be pretty hard to undo that.
but I was in a coma.
it doesn't matter.
california's a no-fault state, so if Brooke wants a divorce, she gets one.
and even if we could contest it, it would be hard to do since the marriagewas annulled, so...
Oh, god.
it's a good sign when he does that.
if you want to undo the divorce, your best shot is to contest the annulment.
but that means we'd have to...
Yeah, yeah.
let me see if I have this right, Mr. Stone.
your client wants to regain control of his company, so you're contesting the annulment of his marriage?
it doesn't sound quite as ridiculous when I explain it, Your Honor.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Mr. Mccann and Mr. Stone are asking the court to insert itself into a church matter.
overturn one, actually, but I'm glad you've been paying attention.
only because I keep waiting for some mention of the separation between church and state.
that still around?
it's hard to tell with the current administration.
funny, but you're gonna have to do better than comedy if you want to convince me not to kick this, Mr. Stone.
your Honor, the first amendment doesn't insulate the church from a civil suit, as the recent spate of priestly misconduct cases demonstrates.
Jake Mccann has every right to contest the annulment of his marriage.
on what grounds?
there have been no allegations of fraud, impropriety or any other form of misconduct.
depends how you define "misconduct," Miss Halston.
both ecclesiastical and California state law require that both parties be notified of annulment proceings.
my client wasn't.
he was in a coma.
Yes, thank you for reminding me.
not only was my client not notified of the annulment, he was unable to contest it, something he had every right to do under church law.
even if Mr. Mccann was fully conscious, there's no reason to believe the church wouldn't have granted the annulment anyway.
that's what trials are for -- to find out what did or would have happened.
I am not gonna let this go to a full-blown trial on just your say-so.
but I'm not inclined to grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, either.
your Honor
I want to hear from the priest who vitiat the marriage.
evidentiary hearing 2: 00 tomorrow.
adjourned.
everything was going great.
in two weeks, I blazed through the screening process.
they sat me down with partners and senior associates.
the only people I didn't meet were the guys in the mailroom.
but then I had lunch with Mason Andrews.
now I was terrified.
this man was my hero, a'ight?
but the minute I shook his hand, I knew the feeling wasn't mutual.
and so begins the speculation.
it's not speculation. It's experience.
that look that Mason Andrews gave me when we sat down
I've seen that look a million times -- that look that says that I'm less than.
your Honor, we didn't realize that mr. Arews gave him the "less than" look.
move to skip the trial and enter judgment for the plaintiff.
Mr. Dowd, I know you're eager to impress your own boss, but please let Mr. Bennett finish his account.
he cracked a joke about defending some people from my old neighborhood, asked me if I wore my hair this way so that my criminal clients would identify with me more.
then he excused himself, citing a court appearance.
he didn't have one.
I checked the dockets.
the only reason I didn't get hired was the same reason he left that lunch early.
black people like me make black people like Mason Andrews uncomfortable.
what did Mr. Andrews say his problem was with black attorneys?
he'd never state his prejudice outright.
did he ever tell you why you didn't get the job?
no.
so you have no evidence from Mason Andrews' mouth or any of his friends or colleagues that he didn't hire you because of your race?
asked and answered, counsel.
why didn't you apply for a job with my firm, Mr. Bennett?
we recruit from the same applicant pool as Andrews Worth.
just didn't think it'd be a good fit.
so you made a choice about what firm fits you best, and yet you're suing Mason Andrews' firm for making the same kind of decision.
it's not the same kind of decision.
I beg to differ.
perhaps I should sue you for discrimination.
I did not go through 12 years of Catholic school and three yes of law school just to sue god.
we're not suing god.
we're suing the Catholic church.
like that distinction's gonna matter when my skin is roasting in the nonconsuming fire of all ernity.
just as long as we're not being dramatic about it.
no, I'm serious, Eli.
look, don't let this rough-edged demeanor fool you.
beneath this tough exterior beats the heart of a girl who still believes in god, prayer and marrying for life.
Eli, Mr. And Mrs. Rivera are here without an appointment.
or an attorney, apparently.
Where's your attorney?
Patti, is it too much to ask you to insulate me from illegal exparte conversations?
this isn't some legal technicality to us, Mr. Stone.
this lawsuit is playing havoc with our lives.
the situation also seems a little inconvenient for Jake.
Jake is my best friend. - Was.
you won't find two people on earth who care about him more than we do.
that kind of sucks for Jake.
what were we supposed to do?
it had been three years, and every doctor, all of them, said that he was never gonna wake up.
you can't blame us for not beinable to see the future, Mr. Stone.
and you can't blame Jake for wanting to get his life back.
his life?
but he doesn't want his life back, Mr. Stone.
he wants ours.
well, Jake disagrees, which is why we're in litigation, and litigation is why we can't continue this conversation.
now please go.
Patti, you're supposed to be my gatekeeper.
you're suing god, and you're telling me what I'm not supposed to do?
I'm not suing god!
speaking of the man upstairs, Jordan would like you in his office...
pronto.
suing god now, are we, Eli?
not the almighty, sir.
uh, just his church.
actually, not an entire church, just a priest.
um, people do that all the time these days.
it's like buying a hybrid.
that's not why I summoned you. Please sit down.
Taylor told me about you breaking off the engagement.
I'm not angry with you, if you're concerned.
I'm not concerned. I "panicked" would be more accurate.
I hope I didn't influence your decision in any way.
is that what she said?
she wasn't forthcoming with specifics.
she's amazing, sir.
and I'm sorry it didn't work out, but, uh...
the reason is personal.
if there nothing else? - No.
you can go.
Oh, not again.
I graduated number one in my Harvard law school class.
after my first interview,
I overheard the two men I'd just been talking with joking that...
letting a negro into Harvard was like teaching a donkey to ice-skate.
that's not being hired because of your race.
is that why you started your own firm?
Yes, and I'm proud to say that my hiring practices are the most diverse in the country.
and these would be the associates you've hired?
well, some of them.
the others had better things to do than to help defend me this afternoon.
nothing further, Your Honor.
how well do you recall our lunch that day, Mr. Andrews?
well enough.
do you recall asking me about my hair?
Yes, because it seemed unkempt.
do you ever wear a 'fro Dreads?
how about some cornrows?
objection. I doubt Mr. Andrews' hair choice has any relevance.
it has as much relevance as my hair had to do with me not getting the job.
overruled.
do you believe you had to change your appearance any way to fit into the corporate world that you now dominate?
well, of course, but that's not racism. That's common sense.
but you don't believe I made tho changes.
as a business owner, I have a right to make decisions about who I do and do not hire.
that right is protected by law.
provided you don't discriminate.
could the brother in the back stand up again, please?
what's the difference between this gentleman... and me?
well, he's not suing me, for one thing.
that's, uh, that's funny.
uh, any other differences?
well, his experience and his were a better fit for my firm, if that's what you mean.
if I subpoena his law school transcripts, am I likely to find that he was also utatorian at one of the leading law schools in the country-- your alma mater?
Mr. Bennett, there's no doubt you're an intelligent man, or you wouldn't have made the lunch in the first place.
so there's no other differences between this black man and me?
are you blind?
which one of us is darker? - Objection!
how about the way we dress?
he's badgering the witness. - He even looks like you.
Mr. Bennett, settle down, or I will hold you in contempt.
the difference is that he doesn't use his race as an excuse for shiftless behavior.
would you care to elaborate on that, sir?
happily.
you showed up at that luncheon with an attitude that I've seen in other black men
K eiceus for rt are, as if the rules that apply to the rest of us don't apply to them.
if I am prejudiced against anything, it's that kind of arrogance!
so the day we had lunch, you weren't eating with a Harvard grad with stellar recommendations and a 3-for-5 record in the public defender's office.
U were eating with a young, arrogant black punk with an unkempt 'fro.
no wonder you left early.
father Hewson, could you please tell the court, what is a marriage in the eyes of the catholic church?
it's a holy sacrament, a lifetime bond between two people before god.
yet here we are, in the presence of two people still living, yet no longer bound in the eyes of the church.
that's what an annulment does.
so this lifetime bond--you can just in a split second erase it?
the process is not that simple.
I'm sure it's not.
for example, I'm sure that some spouses oppose the annulment requested by the other spouse.
Yes, some do.
but Jake Mccann didn't deserve that opportunity?
I consulted with Mr. Mccann's doctors.
every one of them told me he wouldn't wake up.
so I guess what you're saying is, uh, Jake's recovery was a miracle.
Yes, it was.
I guess it's kind of a shame, then, that a priest, of all people, wasn't holding out for such a miracle.
do you think that god's decision to spare Mr. Mccann's life was a sign that he wanted him to fulfill his eternal marital obligations to his wife?
I don't presume to question god's plan for any of his faithful.
no.
I guess you just erase the vows they make.
why are you doing this?
I waited for you to wake up, Jake.
three years I waited.
two of them, I barely left the hospital.
"in sickness and in health." Those were the vows, Brooke.
that's easy for you to say. You were asleep.
I was alone.
I needed someone.
and now?
do you still need him now?
I don't believe that you love him the way that you loved me.
I'm so sorry.
what were you thinking at that lunch, Mason?
what was I thinking?
he rolls in in a cheap 5-button zoot suit with bad shoes.
we're sitting at the best table in the derby room.
he greets the waiter like they're homeys on a street corner.
can you see putting him in a room with a corporate client?
only if they wanted to win their case.
I made sacrifices so he could go to Harvard, so he'd be considered for a corner office instead of a janitorial job.
but the price is you've got to act, look and dress a certain way.
now I'm sorry if that interferes with his keeping it real, but it's not the way we run things at Andrews Worth, and it's not the way you run things either, unless, of course, you've changed your hiring practices lately.
I'm gonna win this case, Mason, because that's what I do for my clients.
but if you want to settle, I'll help you work out a number.
just make sure it's not a guilty conscience that's telling you to make a deal.
my conscience is clear.
we'll go to verdict.
then I'll see you in the morning.
but we're winning.
Yes, the judge will probably vacate the annulment, but...
but I don't think we're winning.
cause what you're trying to win, Jake, you can't get from a lawsuit.
I thought yosaid I could get my company back this way.
your company, yes.
but not Brooke.
well, I don't care about brooke anymore.
I don't think that's true.
she loves him, Jake, and she's happy with him.
you want her to be happy, right?
look...
I know a little something about living on borrowed time, and you've already lost five years of your life.
don't spend the rest of it in a courtroom.
it's like I lost her twice, you know?
once when I went into the coma and again when I woke up.
I understand why you're angry.
I just don't think Brooke's the one to be angry at.
okay.
settle it.
so what was that about-- the "borrowed time" thing?
nothing.
nothing?
Maggie, everything's fine.
thought you weren't coming.
thought you decided it'd be better if I did this alone.
I know that you didn't tell your dad about the aneurysm.
thank you.
I love you, Eli.
you haven't figured that out?
I meant it when I said yes.
and I meant it when I asked.
seems like a long time ago.
three months.
I, uh, tried to return this.
they wouldn't take it back.
no receipt.
it seems like diamonds really are forever, huh?
just like you to make a major purchase without getting a receipt.
I didn't think I'd be taking it back.
it's funny.
I thought it might be a sign.
what does that mean?
you were so sure that breaking things off was the right thing to do.
the guy I'm representing was in a coma for five years.
we're talking about work now?
they told his wife he would never wake up.
so she left him.
and it's hard to blame her.
it was a freak accident when they got married, she didn't know he would go into a coma and their lives would be ripped apart.
you know what could happen to me, and...
and you still want to stay.
that's what I've been telling you all along.
I ruined our engagement party.
your father hates me.
why would you think either of those two things would matter to me more than you?
what does this mean?
I don't know.
guess we should probably talk about last night.
help me. Help me.
I am. I'm gonna settle the case first thing this morning.
I promise.
there's--There's no need to be on my floor.
help me, Stone.
there's something wrong with him.
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. The guy just woke up from a 5-year coma.
he's a freak of nature.
no, medically wrong.
I think you should check him out again.
and what test would you recommend, Dr. Stone?
I was thinking an M. R.I.Maybe?
and I was kidding!
okay, he's had, like, 50 M. R.I. S in as many days, not to mention constant monitoring and more meds than I would care to count.
believe me, if the was something to catch, weould have caught it by now.
in the past few days, I've been very, very close to him.
he's practically been following me home.
well, yeah, yeah, of course you feel close to him.
Yeah, it's a sympathetic transference.
you have a neurological condition.
he's suffered a neurological trauma
that's not it. That's not it.
I'm telling you, I know there's something wrong, Nate.
how, Eli?
how do you know that?
I just do.
it's bad enoug that you convinced him to go to court.
and now you want to subject him to more tests, which will cost him time and thousands of dollars, on a hunch?
I won't do it, Eli.
I'll talk to you later. I've got patients.
my first week as a public defender, I went in for an arrangement, and while I was waiting, an A.D.A. Approached me and told me the gallery I was sitting in was reserved for attorneys, no defendants.
Yeah.
when I told him I was lawyer, he got this...this look...on his face.
it was the same look Mason Andrews gave me when I first met him, and the A. D.A. Was white.
Mason Andrews is black, but the attitudes and assumptions
exactly the same I'm sure many of you are thinking, "black on black prejudice?" That's ridiculous. It's impossible.
wasn't all that long ago they would have said the same thing about interracial marriage or desegregation.
maybe the most telling measure of the strides we've made is the fact that today a black man can rise to a level where he can actually practice...
discrimination...
even if it is against another black man.
Mason Andrews lived through the challenges of segregation on his way to Harvard law school...
became a pillar in the local African-American community and a famed advocate for civil rights.
does that sound like a racist of any stripe?
there's a difference, ladies and gentlemen, between discrimination...and discretion.
all Mason Andrews did was exercise his legal right not to hire someone he didn't care for.
now we all witnessed, Mason Andrews' dislike of Mr. Bennett is steeped in their shared racial heritage.
I would even go so far as to admit Mr. Andrews abhors some resentment of young black men like Keith Bennett.
but resentment is not racism.
and if you have any doubt of that, ask yourselves, if these two men were white...
would we even be here today?
Where's Adam?
he didn't want to be here.
Jake's agreed to the settlement terms.
you and Adam will retain control of the company.
I got the, uh, execution drafts right here.
all signed.
I guess, uh...I guess we're done.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
thank you.
for what it's worth...
I'm glad you and Adam found each other.
I hope you have a good life.
I want you to.
that's the man I fell in love with.
Jake! Call 9-1-1!
help me, stone.
are you all right?
what was it? I thought he was okay.
he was. He...he...
he had an acute M. I...heart attack.
you know, his heart could have been compromised by the coma...
but there weren't any signs.
it's...it's like it just...stopped.
are you okay?
I mean, like you said, there weren't any signs.
there's nothing you could've-- - just...go.
all right, has the jury reached a verdict?
we have, Your Honor.
in the matter of Bennet vs. Andrews, we the jury find no basis for the charge of racial discrimination under the current guidelines of the equal employment opportunity commission.
therefore, we find for the defendant, Mason Andrews.
as no counter claim was brought by the defendant, there will be no damages assessed in this case.
court is now adjourned.
Mason...congratulations.
well, thank you.
I guess you were right, not allowing me to settle.
lunch at the club next week?
I'll call you.
Mr. Bennett?
congratulations on the win.
you didn't have the law.
no, but I had the facts.
some facts, but not proof.
I was wrong before when I said no firm would hire you.
what, you're looking for more black lawyers over there?
no. I need more great lawyers.
I can't believe you talked to Eli.
you promised you wouldn't intervene in my relationship.
he works for me, Taylor.
I promised not to intervene.
I didn't promise not to speak to him.
I'm a lawyer. I look for loopholes.
but you can't...
our relationship is still...
it's still complicated, okay?
you can't go around bullying him into staying with me.
I have not done, and have no plans to do, any such thing, nor do I feel the need to.
what does that mean?
I think Eli is more than a little conflicted about his decision, as any sane man would be.
I think so, too.
but, Taylor, it's equally obvious that he's in a state of...confusion.
I don't want to see you get hurt.
you taught me to fight for the things I care about.
I care about Eli.
and I know what I wanna do.
are you Eli Stone...
ass-hat at law? How much did you drink?
I'm...I'm not sure.
but when the bartender asks you for your keys back, you gotta figure that's not a good sign.
or a good sign, depending...
I cabbed it over.
you gonna be okay?
Ah, it's not like Jake was the first patient I ever lost, although that doesn't make it suck any less, you know?
there's nothing you could've done, nate.
you couldn't have seen it coming.
I know I couldn't.
so how did you?
the reason I came to you, and I asked you to do something about Jake was...
I knew he was gonna die.
you mean, you saw the future?
are you sure you're not the one who's been drinking?
you know I've been seeing things lately.
well, I'm starting to think that they're not just ause of my aneurysm.
I think they may have some greater significance.
Eli, look, it is only natural that you would want to place your diagnosis
no, Nathan.
something's happening to me...
and it's how I knew Jake needed medical help.
he started singin' "good lovin'.
you know those lyrics?
I was feelin' so bad.
I asked my family doctor just what I had.
that you.
that's why every time I saw him, he was dressed as a patient.
I was supposed to get you to help him.
Oh, my god.
I know you don't believe me.
I sure wouldn't, but, uh...
I had to tell someone else, someone close to me.
when dad died, I...I put a cassette in his coffin.
it was of a song that he, uh, he kept singing.
when he took me upstate for that fishing trip...
he...he just kept singing it over and over.
I hate fishing, and he was the worst singer in the world.
but, um, that trip was...
it was really special me.
the song on the cassette was "good lovin'" by the rascals.
nobody else knew aut that.
it's crazy, huh?
Yes, just a little bit.
I need a drink-- more to...drink.
well, I'm out of bourbon.
you had enough, dude.
but, uh, I do have some microwave popcorn.
okay.
and you know what?
there's a rerun of "working girl" on the we channel.
dude, you have got to get back together with Taylor.
I just stopped by to tell you that I'm going to the apartment on Thursday to pick up my stuff.
I've always thought you were the future of this firm.
I just think the way I play the game has got to change.
you're so sure that breaking things off was the right thing to do.
Molokai, Hawaii look at this place.
it's perfect, gorgeous. It's everything I imagined.
it's hotter than that my arm hair just singed off.
Dave Jen, enjoy your vacation!
I hope the underwater camera works out.
Ah, what nice people.
Ah, look at this place.
have you ever seen an ocean like this?
Yeah, in California. It's the same ocean.
Yeah, I'm really glad we're doing this, Eli.
this is what they mean when they say "make every moment count."
I mean, look at us. Nine hours ago, we were at work, and now we're just
getting heatstroke.
don't get too excited. We have work to do.
Maggie, where's our car?
we'll walk. Look it, it'll be fun, we can take in the scenery.
I'm wearing a wool suit.
my internal organs are boilingi n their own juices.
Oh, okay, I get it.
you're trying to tell me that you're
hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!
how many times are you gonna burn your hand before you learn to take out the plate first?
3 Days Ago
the system's worked for me for, like, 30 years, Patti.
what's going on?
well, there are some...
rumors floating around that you're not gonna like.
which do you want to hear first--terrible rumor number one or terrible rumor number two?
pick number one. - I pick number two.
they're saying your win on the wolverine S.U.V. Case ve years ago was overturned.
you're gonna have to retry it.
it's not gonna happen.
posner took over the case once the appeal was filed.
he'll handle the retrial if it doesn't settle, which it will.
how can you be so sure?
jeffrey Powell's been working on this case on contingency, as in unpaid, for the last five years.
even self-righteous do-gooders nd to eat.
besides, this case s tried by old Eli.
everyone around here knows I'm new Eli.
new Eli is no longer working on the side of evil.
I don't think new Eli understands how this place works.
as our senior partner is momentarily absent, let's turn our attention to mundane matters, such as the photocopy department reports paper usage down 8.3% this month.
explanations?
it has to do with some green program.
I got, like, a million memos on it, which is kind of ironic.
but those memos were printed on recycled paper.
ms. Dekker, I applaud your willingness to aver what you no doubt perceive to be an inconvenient truth.
however, copying is a profit center for this firm, which charges clients a 35% markup.
more copies, people!
next item - Mitchell vs. Zyre motors, incorporated.
late last night, first district court of appeals overturned our victory.
of course, you will once again take the lead on the wolverine S.U.V. Litigation, Mr. Stone, and I will once again be second chair.
Oh, uh, sir, I don't think that, uh...
well, I'm--I'm actuall new Eli, and...
I think this is more of a case for...
old eli.
well, perhaps you two can have a conference call.
old eli is uniquely familiar with the wolverine case.
he has a settlement conference with Jeffrey powell in half an hour.
I-I've always wanted to meet-- uh, kick his ass, sir.
I'd like to help Mr. Stone...
kick it.
very well, Ms. Dekker.
it'll do you some good to bill some real hours to a real client.
sorry I'm late, but I had good reason - excellent reason.
in fact, I was welcoming our new hires.
I'm pleased to introduce Keith Bennett.
and proving that nepotism and merit are not mutually exclusive...
my daughter...
you joined the firm-- the firm where I work?
until last week, we were engaged.
in fact, we should probably talk about last week.
we slept together.
I don't need to talk about it.
right, I can tell from the way you haven't returned my calls.
were you calling to get back together, Eli?
that's exactly why I didn't call you back.
plus you probably figured we'd just see each other at work.
Oh, don't read anything into it.
right. What other reason could you possibly have for suddenly leaving your firm of eight years and coming to work here with your ex-fianc?
get over yourself.
my father's been recruiting meto work here for years, okay?
this firm needs a specialistin family law, and I happen to be a good one - and excellent one.
in fact, W.P. K.Is damn lucky to have me.
just...
I-I gotta... Just...one--one second.
it's Keith, right?
I'm Eli.
well...
uh, welcome to the firm.
Donald, you know I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
showing up in my officeat 9: 30 A. M.
it's sad, actually, how much you obviously still want me.
Bense, what is it?
just need a little face time with my favorite ex-boyfriend.
I'm your only ex-boyfriend.
you've been crying.
something happen at work? - It's nothing...
just my life completely falling apart.
is the baby okay?
Yeah, the baby's fine.
it's Donna.
she's having some sort of breakdown.
she's moved out.
but... she's pregnant.
I know she's pregnant.
I was at the embryo transfer.
it's my egg, for god sakes.
I don't get it. Is there someone else?
Yes.
Jesus.
my former lesbian lover is now a heterosexual Jesus freak.
she's seeking sole custodyof the baby, Matt.
she's hired a lawyer.
yeah? Well, so have you.
Mr. Powell?
Maggie Dekker. I'm a big fan.
I wrote a paper during my second year of law school on your strategy in the nuxoll class action.
this is a new trick - tryingto distract me with a sycophant.
it's like you can seeright through me, Jeff.
let me tell you something. You're the worst kind of lawyer
a hypocrite who pretends she cares for the common man while big business heats her pool. Okay?
congratulations on the appeal.
you pulled a rabbit out.
but since we both know you're out of tricks
you're the expert on tricks, Eli.
Jeff, we went over this five years ago.
my subpoena's still on the books, as is the court order granting my motion to compel.
what am I missing here?
it's what I'm missing - Stanley Lyme.
I can't find him, Jeff.
I'd have better luck finding W.M.D. S in Iraq.
you could subpoena those, maybe. - Who's Stanley Lyme?
an engineer, worked for Zyre motors
one of 12 he wanted to depose, none of whom had anything of note to say.
Yes, but Stanley Lymeis the only one to conveniently disappear right before I could depose him.
which wasn't my fault.
we're a law firm, not witness protection.
so instead of going on another fishing expedition, why don't we settle this and avoid repeating history?
if you want to.
this is our number.
just checking to seeif the zeroes ever stop.
it's half what a jury will award Adam and Cori for lost income, pain and suffering, punitives.
I already won this once before.
what makes you think I won't again?
because this time the jury won't be shielded from the consequences of Zyre motors' criminal negligence.
wait. What's he talking about?
five years ago, Adam Mitchell's injuries were so gruesome, Eli was able to convince the trial judge that the mere sight of them would prejudice a jury.
so they heard a dry recitation of Adam's testimony transcript.
but this time, the jury will hear Adam's story from Adam himsel nice to see you again, Mr. Stone.
you spend the night here?
posner told me to bill more hours, so I started looking for Lyme.
not even Posner wants you to pad the bill looking for a witness that could help the other side.
we are legally obligated to find Stanley Lyme.
no, we are legally obligated to make a reasonable effort to find him, and I made it five years ago.
but I was thinking maybe he has friends, relatives.
I found them. I asked. Nothing.
there is actual work I need you to do for this case
a case you volunteered for, remember?
wh-- that was before I knew we were working on the side of evil
representing a company that manufactures an S.U.V.
that flips over, crippling people?
there is no evidence that Zyre motors was responsible for his accident, Maggie.
look, just because Adam Mitchell's in a wheelchair, it doesn't make him a saint.
either way, it's a yucky case.
it's "yucky"?
did you get your law degree by watching "Legally Blonde"a bunch of times?
well, if we have to try to win, I'm at least going to make sure we win by the rules.
I'm finding Mr. Lyme.
you know this won't make Jeffrey Powell like you, right?
I don't really care if he likes me.
a little respect would benice...
from both of you.
Eli! - What?
brain aneurysm, remember?
it was bad enough when Taylor was calling me 16 times a day.
now she's workin' here, and you didn't stop it?
well, I didn't know, and besides, it's not like she consulted me before she took the job.
what do you want me to do, get her fired?
now th's good thinkin'.
I'll get you in with Mr. Wethersby.
even if I could convince Jordan to fire his own daughter,
I can't do that,'cause last week, I-I sorta...
go on.
slept with her.
you fell off the wagon?
how could you do that to me?
I wasn't thinking of you at that particular moment!
well, thank god!
Mr. Posner, what a surprise to see you here.
how are you today, sir?
you ready, Mr. Stone?
we're due in court for opening statements in 20 minutes.
the baby was conceived using my client's egg.
how about we all agree this is something of a gray area and compromise?
Jessica and Donna co-parent.
Ah, pical.
you ask us to concede everything we believe in, and you call it a compromise.
not everything.
Donna's free to give up chicks for dudes.
in fact, on behalf of dudes everywhere, I welcome her endorsement.
in the absence of a formal surrogacy agreement, Donna has all the rights that naturally fall to a child's birth mother, including the right to protect that child from any and all influences she deems harmful.
I'm a harmful influence now?
I need to protect my baby.
our baby.
we're confident to let the judge decide that one.
I need your breasts.
is this some sort of test to see how litigious I am?
because when it comes to sexual harassment, the answer is very.
look, I'm representing a chick who's suing a chick who's represented by a chick, and I just found out the judge happens to be...
a chick? - Exactly.
you know, if they were all black, I'd ask that Keith guy, but I really need a woman up there with me.
this is important.
and you couldn't have just said that?
I thought I did.
look, the client's an old friend.
we dated in college, and she's suing her ex-girlfriend for parental rights over their unborn fetus.
your ex-girlfriend's a lesbian?
who isn't these days?
anyway, it's a family case.
that's your thing, and I could really use the help.
besides, think about how crazy it's gonna drive Stone.
all right, tell me about the case. - Okay.
in one instant, a life can change.
they say a picture's worth a thousand words.
at the end of this trial, you will be asked to put a price tag on how much this young man's ability to walk is worth.
I hope you're prepared to do sth.
Oh, it is wonderful dating imiami.
all the single men under 80 are cocaine smugglers.
the golden girls.
it was a great show.
you're probably wondering what it has to do with this case.
well, I'll tell you - about as much as the footage Mr. Powell just showed you.
that wasn't the S.U.V. That Adam Mitchell was driving, and that wasn't Adam Mitchell driving it.
Oh, and Adam Mitchell's carnever caught fire.
no, that was just a stunt to make you angry at my client.
Mr. Powell said that at the end of...
that at the end the trial, you'll be asked to put...
a price tag on walking.
anyone who looks at this trial fairly and objectively...
Mr. Stone!
nothing further.
I need flip-flops to go to the men's room, and W...
now they're singing in court - the one placethat's been vision-free.
and what'sthis week's musical number?
it's "one more try" by guess who?
what are you, his comeback tour?
can we just proceed to the vision interpretation, please?
here you are, trying a case one more time.
maybe god wants you to do things differently this time.
God could send down one of those pillar of fire thingies, I still couldn't drop the case.
free will is what defines us, Eli.
Oh, really?
cause I don't feel like it was a choice to be a prophet, you know?
things were so much easier before.
I wasn't so confused all the time and morally conflicted and alone?
is this still about Taylor?
she joined my firm.
Oh, that's why you're so crabby.
I miss her.
seeing her every day is just gonna make it worse.
Eli, what you're going through is rough.
you shouldn't go through it alone if you don't have to.
maybe "one more try"is about her.
what is this, multiple choice?
dude, it's not like I have a copy of "prophecy for dummies" lying around here somewhere.
what do you think the visions are about?
it was like a sign from god.
my first ultrasound, when I saw that tiny little heartbeat...
a small miracle was growing inside of me, and I...
I realized that I was going to be responsible for another person's soul, and I knew what I had to do.
renounce the homosexual lifestyle?
objection to the term "lifestyle" - it's prejudicial, close-minded and offensive.
it's nice to see you suddenly so supportive of the gay movement, Mr. Dowd.
now pipe down.
well, I never considered melf... gay.
I always thought that I would marry a man.
but, um, I fell in love with Jessica, and I thought thatI could love her enough to make myself something that I'm just...
not.
and how did you come to that realization?
well, after the ultrasound, I started going backto church.
after a few monthsand a whole lot of prayer, I knew what I had to do.
my family is speaking to me now.
they're welcoming me back home.
this is what I want.
this is what my baby needs.
you're carrying a fetus conceived with Jessica's egg, aren't you?
were you infertile? Something wrong with your eggs?
no, nothing like that. - Then I'm confused.
why would you go through a costly and time-consuming procedure to carry someone else's baby, Miss Milton, if you didn't intend to co-parent?
I was a different person then.
I wasn't myself.
you seem to have a relatively smart lawyer there.
I'm kind of surprisedshe hasn't told you that doesn't matter.
it was indescribable. I could barely breathe.
the roof was crashed in, and it was pressing against my head.
and I felt like if I just let go, that it would all be over.
what kept you hanging on?
my cell phone, funny enough.
it started ringing, and I couldn't reach it, but I could see Cori's number on the caller I. D,and I knew...
that I had to hold on so that I could dance with herat our wedding.
according to the statement you gave the C.H.P.
your S.U.V. Flipped when you swerved tavoid-- and--and I'm quoting here
a metal object in the road.
Yeah, that's right.
where were you driving from at the time of the accident?
uh, deer hunter lodge.
I was having dinner with Cori.
you mean the deer hunter lodge and tavern, actually.
did you consume alcohol that night?
a few beers, but I-I wasn't drunk.
right. You only had "a few beers."
your wife called you on her cell. Where was she?
she was back at the lodge.
the lodge and tavern.
so you left without her?
cori and I - we...
we had an argument, but it wasn't a big deal.
there must have been quite a few police and E.M.T. Personnel at the accident scene.
any of them find the metal object that you say caused you to swerve?
you would have to ask them.
uh, I did.
I have affidavits from, uh, from every single police officer and E.M.T.
who was at the accident scene that night, and none of them found that metal object.
objection - facts not in evidence. - That's too bad.
I agree, Your Honor.
that metal object is not in evidence.
so let me see if I have this straight, Mr. Mitchell.
you had a few drinks, but you weren't drunk.
and you swerved to avoid a metal object that no one found.
that S.U.V. was defective.
that is why it rolled over.
Yes, it rolled over, but that doesn't meanit was defective, sir, and it doesn't meanthat your driving wasnt't.
Oh, come on, Maggie. Don't give me that look. I was doing my job.
well, I don't want to watch it.
I won't be in court tomorrow.
I'm gonna find Lyme.
maybe he knows what's right.
I hope you're happy with yourself.
do any women around here like me anymore?
where the hell am I?
Hawaii, Brah.
Hawaii?
Eli, are you okay?
you passed out on the bathroom floor.
I did?
I'm calling your brother.
uh, Taylor, Taylor, come in here.
just...Please don't call nate.
in fact, it would be very considerate of you to forget this ever happened.
what about the guy who dragged you out of the men's room?
and what about the 50 or so lawyers, paralegals and assistants who saw him do it?
I say I've been doing a cleanse, and I got light-headed.
what really happened, Eli?
normal stuff.
I-I-I walked in, and suddenly I was in Hawaii.
it's just like you to goon our honeymoon without me.
well, look on the bright side, you know?
at least this isn't your problem anymore.
I want you to be my problem.
you joined the firm because of me?
you make it sound pathetic.
I don't think it's pathetic to fight for something that's important to you
something that'sthe most important.
I'm gonna be here every day, Eli, until you give us one more try.
Taylor, if you're free tomorrow night, uh, I think we're supposed to
I mean, I-I'd like to, uh, talk things out...
go for dinner together?
I'd love that.
why are we oining about this alleged waiver now?
it's unfair surprise.
these documents were never produced.
uh, we just received Miss Benson's paperwork from the clinic yesterday, Your Honor.
besides, this is a motion for injunctive relief, therefore no discovery, and therefore no obligation to produce.
donor hereby waives all parental rights and relinquishes
all such duties to any child resulting from the fertilized human egg here under.
I can see why you're poleaxed.
miss Benson provided us with all her documents for review.
I assure you this waiver was not among them.
nonetheless, she signed it.
fair point.
Waiver's signed, waiver in.
what about visitation?
I'll go to Ohio every other weekend.
I'll move there.
come on. Don't do this to yourself.
what do you mean?
you might want to start considering the possibility...
that you won't be a part of the baby's life.
but you have other options, Jess.
you can have another baby with someone who loves you.
I'm not saying like a couple or anything.
I could just...
donate some of my boys.
heck, if you want, I could even do it the old-fashioned way.
I'm truly selflesslike that.
Bneath that frat boy exterior, you're actually very sweet.
you always were.
but I don't want just any baby.
I want the one I made with the woman I love.
right.
it was devastating.
one minute we had our entire lives ahead of us, and the next I was changing out his catheter.
I gave up my career when we realized that Adam would needround-thclock care.
it must be hard.
we take it day by day.
some days are better than others...
for adam and for me.
how do you get through the bad days?
I remember how close we came to not having any days, good or bad.
Adam testified that you tried calling him after he left the tavern?
that's true.
phone records indicate that you tried 7 times in 12 minutes.
I was worried about him.
I mean, clearly I had reason to be.
yet you couldn't have known that he'd been in an accident.
we'd had a fight.
I wanted to make sure that he was okay.
objection.
the witness testified that she was worried.
one phone call is worried, your honor. Seven in a row is urgent.
overruled.
but tread lightly, Mr. Stone.
Mrs. Mitchell, why was it so urgent that you get in touch with Adam?
if he wasn't that drunk, he wasn't that angry, why were you so worried?
I don't know. I
you don't know.
yet you called him once, then again, then again, then again, then again
Adam was angry, and he was on the road, and it was dark
and he'd had too much to drink? - Maybe.
maybe he did.
Ah, I've been looking all over for you.
bet you thought you could avoid me, but what you don't know is that no man on earth can hide from me.
I find people, and I don't just find any people.
I find people named...
Yes!
no. Well, kind of.
see, I found the next best thing.
I found out who Lyme met with right before he disappeared.
wanna know how? - No.
I called Zyre motors and spoke to the head of H. R.
I asked her when Stanley stopped working there.
she said the last day he workedat Zyre motors was June 12th, which struck me as funny, 'cause I remember that on June 11th, someone here billed Zyre motors 2 hours for "lemon reversal.
Maggie - don't you see?
"lemon" is Lyme!
someone here met with Lyme before he disappeared, and you know who it was?
you know that?
well, why didn't you tell me?
I told you I looked for Lyme.
I told you that further looking was a waste of time.
so you know posner met with Lyme before he disappeared?
what--why didn't you do something?
such as what, convincing Posner to produce the witness he went to the trouble of hiding in the first place?
well, what about doing what's right, what's required by law?
Maggie, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but we work at wethers by Posner & Klein.
we're the guys who beat upon paraplegics and their wives when we're not busy making sure satan's getting a break on his taxes.
if you think that, then why do you work here?
I thought you had changed.
why do you work here?
I may be trying to change, and I might not be pulling it off lately, but at least I know what this ple is.
has it ever occurred to you you might be a better lawyer if you saw thing show they are instead of how you wish they were?
I know this is a strange question.
like you ask any other kind.
are you by any chance, uh, a member of a gospel choir?
why, yes, I am.
all black people are, particularly all black women.
we love to raise our handsand praise Jesus!
you're being sarcastic now.
not just now.
so you're not in a gospel choi rwith, say, a relative of a guy named Stanley Lyme who knows where lyme went and why no one canfind him?
what is this about,eli?
I'm sorry.
I just...
Maggie's right.
I-I pretend to be this new guy, but, uh...
I'm still pond scum.
old Eli reared his ugly head in court today, savaginga paraplegic victim's wife
old Eli, who let Martin Posner hide a witness who just might makethe plaintiff's case.
I want to do the right thing, but...
I've waited five yearsto hear you say that.
don't ask me why I know or how I know, but I know where Stanley Lyme is.
what? How?
what did I just say?
now do you want to know where Lyme is or not?
get your stuff.
meet me downstairs in ten minutes.
our flight leaves in an hour.
flight?
you were right.
that's the last time I'm gonna say it, okay?
I was just thinking about where we should...
what is it?
I'm sorry. I have to work tonight-- the Zyre motors trial.
you know, I wouldn't cancel unless it was absolutely necessary.
Eli, should I pack an overnight bag?
work too hard.
so...
no overnight bag?
still here?
I haven't found anything that trumps the waiver Jess signed yet.
nothing proving Donna intended to st with Jessica?
I've learned more about lesbian love than I ever cared to know.
and believe me when I tell you that's a high bar.
Hey, you want to grab a drink?
so stone's outand Dowd's in, huh?
all right. Let me clear off the desk.
you're not really this much of a pig.
no, I am.
the only woman I wasn't like this with was Jess.
pathetic, I know.
no, it's not pathetic.
I know a thing or two about wanting at you can't have.
you know, if I didn't know him any better,
I'd never believe stone could be dumb enough to let you go.
he hasn't.
I mean...
I mean, we're-- you know, we're still working things out.
right. Well, let me tell ya... - thanks.
the only thing worse than losing the love of your life is having her find the love of hers.
you're a therapist when she's happy, a relationship coach when they fight...
a cameraman when they throw a party.
did you record the shower?
it was a partyfull of lesbians.
there was no way I wasn't going to record it.
Matt, you gotta get me that tape.
okay, so we know he owns a surf shack, right?
uh, so maybe we can narrow down the candidates by posing as surf journalists and
the town's about a block long, veronica mars.
if you're so smart, you find it.
what?
am I missing something?
I thought the whole point of me disappearing was that you guys wouldn't, you know, appear.
Yes, but I recently located my professional conscience.
well, mazel tov, but that's you.
for me, disappearing wasn't about conscience.
it was about survival.
Zyre motors put out a hit on you?
just ignore her.
you ever see "the insider"?
that's actually a pretty accurate depiction of what happens towhistle-blowers in this country.
doing that R.P.E. was the biggest mistakeI ever made.
what's an R.P.E?
roll overpropensity evaluation.
what did you test?
Zyre motors alwaystested their S.U.V.'s static stability factor--that's its risk of rollover
using cars with optimal tire pressure.
but tires lose their air pressure, right?
and - and you told Zyre motors about this?
wrote up a full reportto Mr. Reidy himself.
he buried it.
a few months later, I get paid a visit from a partner in ur firm.
he's got a check for $2 million and a few suggestions about how I might want to spend it.
I'm really sorry you guys came all this way, but I-I won't testify.
got a whole new life now, and I'm not risking it by saying so in open court.
it's all right, Mr. Lyme.
you don't have to. - What?
wrote up a full report to Mr. Reidy himself. He buried it.
a few months later, I get paid a visit from a partner in your firm.
he's got a check for $2 million and a few suggestions about how I might want to spend it.
well, I supposeI have two reactions.
first is, you're fired.
I don't care what piece of paper Jordan signed.
second is, we have nothing to worry about.
this is hearsay. It's inadmissible.
you can't fire me for discharging an ethical and legal obligation pursuant to a valid subpoena and motion to compel.
as for the hearsay issue, out-of-court statements can be admissible where the witness is unavailable, and we probably don't want to invite an investigation as to why Mr. Lyme is unavailable.
you're not really blackmailing a partner of this firm and one of its clients?
"Blackmail"is an ugly word, sir.
I think a better term, and for all our sakes, a more accurate one, is "limitation of liability."
you have exposure here.
Zyre motors has exposure, and I am suggesting a way to limit that exposure
specifically, we settle, preferably by offeringan amount so substantial that the plaintiffs have no choice but to accept, thus making sure certain questions don't get asked.
or you can throw that recorder in the trash.
I doubt I'll be doing that, sir.
thank you all so much for coming to our egg party, especially those who made this joyous occasion possible, but mostly to Jessica, for giving me the most precious of gifts
literally a piece of herself.
honey, I want you to know you will always have my heart.
this was shot after miss milton testified that she had gone back to church, after she claims that she was having doubts about her relationship.
seems to me you've got two choices here, Your Honor
give my client equal parental rights or give Miss Milton an oscar.
this isn't over yet.
jeez, Jeff, can I at least get the offer out before you reject it?
this is what our client is prepared to settle for.
$5 million. Sealed.
we can wire the money today.
trial's not going that bad for you.
something's got you spooked.
you wish.
no, Miss Dekker here prevailed upon Zyre motors to do the right thing.
she can be very persistent.
miss Dekker, you ever decide to leave this insidious institution...
Thanks, but, um...
on wednesdays, they give us muffins.
looks like we've got a deal.
but I will draft the settlement papers.
Jeff, are you ever gonna trust me?
muffins?
well, you wanted to know why I work here.
there you go.
it's all about the muffins.
you did this.
don't bother denying it.
I know it was you.
you know what was me?
do not insult my considerable intelligence, Patricia.
you told Stone where to find the engineer.
haven't you punished me enough?
you've barely acknowledged my existence in five years.
you do realize it's been...
it's been five years since you broke up with me?
it's also been five years since Eli tried this case for the first time.
you ended things between us because of this case?
because of what you did in his case.
and I let you, because I was falling for you.
so I looked the other way.
well...
now that it's behind us...
do you think there's a chance we could give this...
us...
one more try?
I'm sorry, Martin.
I don't.
all rise.
the law is clear.
the waiver is legally binding, and the exceptions don't apply in this case.
but... the...spirit of those exceptions
that the parties' true intentions be honored--does.
accordingly, I find that the intention of this couple was to co-parent their baby and therefore grant Ms. Benson's petition for joint custody.
I'm, uh, further enjoining Ms. Milton from leaving the bay area.
we're adjourned.
I talked it over with my family and our minister, and we all agreed that if this happened...
it would be best that after the birth, I just go back home to Ohio.
you mean- - you can have him.
I won't contact you again.
"him"?
it's a boy.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
that thing with Maggie wasn't what it looked like.
at least we're acknowledging what it looked like.
I guess it wouldn't help if I said I'd sooner pull out my nostril hair than spend six hourson a plane with Maggie.
pull out your nostril hair?
Really?
it's not important.
I should never have come to work here.
we'll figure it out. - Will we?
will I ever really be able to make you happy, Eli?
Eli, Jordan wants to see you.
he says it won't wait.
congratulations, Stone.
you wanted to see me?
Morton Reidy, C.E.O. of Zyre motors
you know, the man you extorted into settling filed a grievance with the state bar.
he couldn't do that without admitting he paid off a witness.
you're assuming the grievance was related to Stanley Lyme.
your literal song and dance in open court was the basisfor his complaint, calling into question your fitness to practice law.
I'm not gonna like where this is going, am I?
the bar appointed a prosecutor who's learned the Zyre motor trial wasn't your only incident.
she's recommended they initiate disbarment proceedings against you, Eli.
you're meant to do great things, and you're gonna help me.
dad, you okay?
I'm pleased to introduce our new hires-- Keith Bennett and my daughter.
Taylor's working here, and you didn't stop it?
maybe I did the wrong thing, breaking up with her.
get down!
is there something really wrong with you?
no, sir.
you know I've been seeing things lately.
I' m starting to think that they're cause of my aneurysm.
you're gonna sign my physical after what you just saw?
I'm going out on the limb with you.
prosecutor recommended they initiate disbarment proceedings ainst you.
I' admit it.
I'm not your typical lawyer.
for one thing, like being a lawyer.
I might be the only one who does-- present company excluded.
I enjoy practicing law.
it's representing other lawyers I'm not crazy about.
look, I'm in a bit of a spot here.
during your last trial, you interrupted your opening argument to sing a song, which not unsurprisingly prompted an investigation by the state bar, and now you're looking at sanctions and possible disbarment.
you're not in a bit of a spot.
you're in a deep, dark hole with smooth walls, very far from the surface.
so you're optimistic then.
Mr. Stone, we bill by the quarter hour here, so, uh, why don't you save yourself $137 and tell me why you can't seem to find a lawyer to defend you.
I think you got a leak in your A. C.Or something.
ticktock and cha-ching, Mrstone.
okay, so...
turns out-- and you may find this funny that my erratic behavior which is calling my fitness to practice law into question is the result of...a-a brain aneurysm.
so the allegations against you are not only true, but you're also hiding a life-threatening condition.
you make it sound like I don't have much of a shot.
my mistake, because I was trying to convey that you don't have any shot.
he's dead?
as in dead dead?
no, alive dead.
he is a zombie.
we're into zombie law now?
I thought we were all booked up with blood-sucking clients.
those of you who, like mr. Stone, missed the front an back page of this morning's paper, at last night's golden state marvels game, all-star catcher jayson turk hit a foul ball which struck his third base coach in the head...
fatally.
Yes, I picked an excellent night to bring the kids out to the firm's luxury box.
Mr. Turk being a long-standing client, we'll be marshalling to his defense.
defense of what?
they can't prosecute someone for an accident.
Mr. Turk's career has been dogged by allegations of steroid abuse.
the D. A.'S office is hoping to use the threat of prosecution, no matter how unjustified, to force mr. Turk to admit to the juicing.
JAYSON'S coming in to the office today, and I'm having lunch with his publicist.
this is slightly different from negotiating an endorsement contract for overpriced cross trainers.
Mr. Bennett has the requisite criminal law experience.
thank you, sir.
who could resist those puppy dog eyes, mr. Dowd?
why don't you back up mr. Bennett?
uh, next item-- need a volunteer to handle the discovery responses in garland vs. Hornby.
actually, sir, I was handling garland.
true, but given your upcoming disciplinary hearing with the state bar this afternoon,
I thought you appreciate having your load lightened a bit.
<u> "who'll Stop The Rain"</u>
I'm getting rained on now.
it's not bad enough that I'm facing disbarment.
now I got my own personal weather front.
God used rain to wipe out his first draft of humanity.
so did Hurakan.
mayan god.
you spend a lot of time on wikipedia, don't you?
so this is the second time you've seen your boss singing to you, eli.
what does that tell you?
he should try out for "american idol"?
you said he was performing "who'll stop the rain"?
maybe jordan is thone who'll stop the rain.
now what do you think the rain represents?
my disbarment hearing, obviously, but I don't know how Jordan can stop it.
he's too busy holding a fire sale with my caseload.
well, he's a powerful lawyer.
maybe he could exert some professional influence with the bar.
no, it's too late for that.
Holly raines is prosecuting.
she's like my own personal javert.
the lawyer prosecuting you is named "Raines"?
as in "who will stop the"?
that's not it.
I'm not asking jordan to represent me.
if my aneurysm comes up, he'll figure out that I lied to him when I told him I was perfectly healthy.
you lied?
to your boss?
straight to his face.
I'm very good at it.
got an "A" in the course at law school.
yeah?
what's that diploma gonna be worth you get disbarred?
I was just thinking, an argument with my ex would be just the thing to take my mind off my troubles.
I didn't come to brawl.
what happened at the staff meeting this morning?
that wasn't a George Michael song.
I'm glad we've reached the point where what's strange isn't the fact that I'm hearing music
it's who's singing it.
have you thought that maybe...
have you thought that maybe not practicing wouldn't be the worst thing in the world?
but I want to practice.
would you want to be represented by an erratic lawyer who could drop dead at any moment?
so much for asking you to represent me.
I thought you were having someone outside the firm do it.
I was, until I couldn't find anyone outside the firm willing to do it.
well, there are plenty of lawyers in this town.
they don't seem to be returning my calls, even the guy with the 800 number and the bus ads.
sometimes I think the only thing keeping me from turning into my alcoholic screwup of a father is...
this.
I don't understand.
is this some kind of desperate attempt to get back with eli?
of course not.
he doesn't even know I'm here.
I'm sorry, but I'm at a loss as to why you think I, of all people, would want to help eli with this.
you've always been fond of eli.
you would be racing to his defense right now if he hadn't broken up with me.
perceptive.
I was seeing someone else.
that's why we called off the wedding.
your... behavior...would explain eli hitting the bottle or turning in sloppy work.
it doesn't explain singing in court or diving headfirst into the cake at your engagement party.
he's angry.
I think he's just acting out.
not only that, he was protecting me.
and now he needs your protection.
I guess this is me-- the hot seat.
this is the state bar of california hearing department "b" in re eli stone, who is charged with violation of state bar act article 12
incapacity to attend law practice, judge Samuel Asquith presiding.
representing the state bar in this matter is Holly Raines, and the respondent is represented by...
Mr. Stone, where is your attorney, sir?
my apologies for being late.
jordan wethersby, your honor.
I'll be representing mr. Stone in these proceedings.
very well.
so I looked for a "thanks for getting your dad to represent me at my disbarment hearing" card, but I couldn't find one.
did you look next to the "sorry I called off our wedding because of the guy from wham!" display?
I assume you didn't tell him about the, uh...
Yeah, somehow I figured you'd prefer he didn't find out.
doesn't mean he's not going to, eli.
if you haven't been hooked up with an assistant yet, I could spare patti.
you think that'll be a good idea?
she's the best assistant at the firm.
think of it as my way of thanking you...
at least till I find that card.
let's talk about last night.
well, not much to say, really.
I swung the wood, and I could feel from the contact that it was gonna go foul.
when joe went down, it was like time stopped.
he was lying there, and...
and his legs are twitchin', and I just thought that was something they did in the movies, you know?
what I don't understand is, how could jayson get in trouble with the police?
it's not the police.
it's the D. A.'S office.
they know there's no crime here, but they're pushing 'cause they got a taste for jayson.
I don't use steroids-- never have, never will.
it's an unfortunate fact of life these days
nobody believes hard work and determination alone can raise a batting average.
but we know the truth, and we'll proceed from there.
so what do we do?
I haven't been arrested. Am I gonna be?
no.
we'll make sure of it.
we'll talk to the A. D.A. Who's pushing this, see if we can come to some kind of understanding.
we'll be itouch.
Thanks. - Take care.
take care. - Thank you.
what the hell was that?
a client comes in here looking for confidence and willing to pay $550 an hour for it, you give it to them.
I'm t selling anybody something I'm not positive I can deliver.
if you can't keep the guy who hit a foul ball out of jail, stone's not the only one who should lose his bar card.
you don't know this A. D.A. I do.
you're not representing some gangbanger caught with a nickel bag of crack.
marijuana.
there's no such thing as a nickel g of crack.
whatever.
now that we've settled who's got the relevant expertise here, wanna join me at the D. A.'S office?
I can see things.
when I look at eli, I know something's wrong, and I don't just mean with the bar.
I'm not trying to be a pain.
I'm trying to be a friend.
even if eli doesn't want my help, I can't help wanting to give it.
Hi, patti.
listen, I'm still without a legal assistant, and eli said that if I needed anything, I could trouble you.
did he?
that sounds so...like him. - Yeah.
so if you're not too busy, and you can manage to read my handwriting,
I really need this draft typed and formatted.
I'll put it right at the tippy-top of my to-do list.
so...
he finally freed himself of that woman.
what could possibly be wrong with him?
I really appreciate this.
I-I know things have been strained between us of late.
well, I understand from taylor that there were...
mitigating factors.
as her father, I'm...embarrassed on several levels.
I-I'm not sure I follow.
excellent. That should expedite our dropping of the topic.
you're taking the stand tomorrow.
obviously, you'll be called upon to account for your odd behavior these past two months.
how am I supposed to do that?
by not accounting for it.
let's cut to the chase, mr. Stone.
we have an entire courtroom of witnesses who saw you singing during your opening argument in the zyre motors trial.
since I highly doubt that outburst was legal strategy on your part, we'll have to obfuscate.
I can't admit or deny that it was part of my legal strategy without discussing my strategy, and I can't do that without violating privilege.
she won't let you hide behind attorney/client confidentiality.
what about the singing and dancing in your law firm?
or would that be confidential strategy as well?
what I do outside the attorney/client relationship isn't relevant to my fitness to practice law.
ms. Raines is an effective litigator, but her weakness is that she overreaches.
so you don't deny these outbursts?
and you have to trap her when she does.
I didn't know that singing was against the law.
what else could I lose my license for--playing the piano?
and once you've moved her out of position, you attack.
in the last 2 months, my trial record's been 3 and 1, winning over $15 million for my clients.
if I'm unfit to practice law, maybe the lawyers I beat should be invited to your witch hunt.
nicely done.
by the way, have you seen Raines' witness list?
third up from the bottom.
I'm sure this relates to your physical, which your brother signeoff on last month.
Raines is just fishing.
then you shouldn't have chummed the waters it was foolish having your own brother examine you.
makes it appear you have something to hide.
well, it's aood thing, then, that I don't.
well, obviously, that's a lie.
anyone who collects baseball cards ne cartas, sabe knows that jayson turk is on steroids.
in 5 years, his hat size went from 8 1/2 to 8 3/4.
the only adult I know whose head actually gets bigger is the hulk.
so what are you charging him with-- first-degree unsubstantiated innuendo?
um, no.
I was thinking, uh, homicide.
the guy hit a foul ball.
did you get beaned in the head?
who's the suit with the mouth?
he's got a point, paul.
you can't make a murder charge with these facts.
it was an accident.
so is hitting someone with your car after you've had three martin.
it's still criminally negligent homicide.
I'm not seeing the martini here.
steroids.
hitting a major league fastball in the vicinity of other people while under the influence of strength-enhancing drugs?
that sounds pretty reckless to me.
now fortunately, we don't have to be adversarial.
if jayson admits to using steroids and agrees to testify against his suppliers,
I can make this whole thing go away.
so can I.
we'll get a judge to kick this.
okay.
tell your client to expect a visit from some police officers.
thought that went really well.
uh, you don't want to do your lesmugct with me right now.
cancel your lunch plans.
we're gonna try this serious way.
my lunch plans?
you have to appreciate the irony.
they wanted to revoke my license, but it turned out that you had lost your license, okay.
so what are our opons?
choice one--we tell truth that you covered up my rain aneurysm, and I wind up disbard, and you lose your medical license.
not really feeling choice one.
there is a choice two, but you're not gonna like it.
if it doesn't involve me losing my license, I'm on board.
you lie.
you mean continue tlie, under oath this time.
not for me.
this time, you have to do it for you.
I'm sorry.
I know I got you into this, nate.
but I can't think of any other way to get you out.
you know, I know I razz you a lot, Eli, about your life, your choices, your bewildering decisions.
but I've always known that you're an incredible attorney, so just tell me the truth.
if you were my lawyer, and I was your client, what would you tell me to do?
lie.
one of this city's many fine and tall bridges.
can I get that draft I left?
I never got to it. Try back later.
so what about the other one, the husky one from marin?
I gotta call you back.
I asked you to do something.
why didn't you do it?
I've been busy.
look, patti, I weathered your hostilities when I was with eli.
but now that I work here, I have got to know
what the hell is your problem?
can I be honest with you?
this is you hold in back ?
I don't like who Eli became after he started dating you.
I didn't change Eli, Patti. I couldn't
after he started seeing you, the firm's smaller clients weren't worth his time.
Eli has been at this firm for eight years.
he has been dating me for two.
how do you explain the last two months, the cases he's taken, what he's done right before and since he dumped you?
may be because he's sick.
or...
maybe now he's better.
you know what? I'll do my own typing.
Oh, here we are.
well, if Jayson Turk's going to jail, at least his lawyers will be well-fed.
why do you think we asked Mr.Bosner to join us for a nice lunch?
honestly, I don't care.
I have work to do on the jayson turk case.
this is the jayson turk case.
look at you. - How are you?
excellent, excellent. - Good to see you.
uh, to of my foot soldiers-- Keith Bennett, Matt Dowd.
you both know the district attorney.
Hello, Keith, Matt.
sir.
join us for a minute?
all right. - Sit, sit.
funny we should bump into you.
my minions here were just venting to me about one of yours
paul Sweren. - Yes.
the jayson turk matter.
terrible business, that.
fortunately, the city's district attorney doesn't prosecute based on gossip.
paul sweren doesn't see it as gossip.
only because he's sitting in the cheap seats.
the view's a little different from the luxury boxes, like they'll have at the new marvels stadium
if they can ever get that thing built, I mean.
you know, that something of a non sequitur.
not at all.
new stadiums cost money.
money comes from public funding, which comes from local support, which might be hard to come by if you slap a murder charge on san francisco's favorite son.
no, that would be Barry Bonds.
still, it would be unfortunate if the city lost that stadium.
and, you know, not every death is ariminal matter.
exactly. Accidents happen all the time.
Marty, I'll talk to Sweren, see if we can't work something out.
appreciate that, Lowell.
my pleasure. - Lowell.
boys.
sir. - sir.
don't worry.
as staing pitcher, you still record the win.
I just get the save.
Dr. Stone, you gave your brother a physical at the bequest of wethersby, posner & klein, correct?
and an M. R.I. With contrast, yes.
and what were the results?
I-it's hard, um, to
how about I give it a try?
what about something simple, like, uh,"brain scan normal"?
isn't that what you wrote on your brother's medical clearance form
"brain scan normal"?
is that your signature, doctor?
looks like it.
maybe you should've become a lawyer like your brother.
is that your signature?
Danny, come on, I wanna show you something.
Oh, man! Let me see. Let me see.
okay, just be careful.
if i get it wet, Nate will kill me.
I mean--I mean, those--those are huge.
come down here and sing that! - Eli, isn't that your dad?
the clouds making that noise to explain the facts... in song!
no, that just looks like him. - Song!
dude, check her out!
man, th-that's your dad.
what's wrong with him?
how am I supposed to breathe without the sky?
should we call, like, the police or something?
just forget it!
tell me that! Come down here and sing that!
I can breathe, but you just smell the music smell-- - dad!
Where's the bottle?
let's go home.
is that your signature?
your honor? - Eli?
I need to clarify- - you are represented by counsel, counsel.
if you want to assert an objection, you have to
I don't want to object.
I want to clarify something for the record.
your honor, my client's mistaken.
we don't need any-- - I can explain why my brother appears to be having trouble in identifying his own signature.
he didn't sign my medical form. I did.
I forged his signature.
I'd like a recess to speak with my client.
well, apparently, the feeling is not mutual, Mr. Wethersby.
why did you do this, mr. Stone?
because I didn't want anyone, especially mr. Wethersby, to discover that I have a brain aneurysm.
Dr. Stone, this aneurysm--is it the cause of your brother's erratic behavior?
Objection--doctor/patient privilege. Don't answer.
fine.
Mr. Stone, the episodes you've been experiencing are they symptoms caused by the aneurysm? - Objection.
Yes.
and are you undergoing any treatment at this time?
no.
and why is that?
because there isn't any treatment.
uh, it's inoperable.
is it fatal?
it's possible that I could live to be 100, or--or, yes, it could-- it could be fatal.
your honor, I think the state bar rests.
I'd like that recess now, your honor.
and you have it, mr. Wethersby.
but I don't think either you or your client is going to be very pleased with my decision when we recoene.
sir, I... - don't.
Yes, Eli lied to you.
which, believe me, he and I will be discussing very soon.
for right now, however, I'm more concerned with your dishonesty.
I'm sorry, but I needed you to represent Eli, and I had no
I'm not referring to the fantasy you concocted.
I'm referring to the fact that you stood in this very office and told me Eli was in good health.
are you serious?
I love him, and he could die.
any minute, I could lose him.
you're an adult, and I expect there to be secrets between us, but for there to be dishonesty...
I'm very disappointed in you.
Eli has been like a son to you...
and it's like you don't even care that he could die.
and you're disappointed in me?
I'm an idiot.
just because you told the truth?
no, bcause for a minute there, you actually had me thinking that there was some greater meaning to all of this, that--that maybe, just maybe,
I was supposed to be in-house counsel for the almighty.
and that makes me the second biggest moron in this room.
what made you reveal the aneurysm?
I had a vision during the hearing.
I had one of those fun little father/son flashbacks.
I'd forgotten how out-there he could be and how--how mad it would make me.
seeing him there like that, I...
I wasn't gonna let Nate ruin his life, just like our father nearly did.
lie down. - Why?
in the past, the needle has given clarity to these flashbacks.
give my regards to your father.
what?
my friend saw you...at the park.
everyone at school's gonna know now.
gonna know what?
I was just plaacting, is all.
just play-acting.
I'm sure it didn't look that bad.
at least when you're at the bar, nobody else can see.
look, Eli, I know sometimes...
I don't seem to be makin' a whole lot of sense.
but the reason for that is I...
it's like I can see too much.
yeah...
I mean, when my eyes are open, I see what's right in front of me, but I also see...
other things...
things that...haven't happened yet.
and maybe they won't. They--they don't...always, but sometimes...
sometimes they do.
does anything like that ever happen to you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I can see the future, too.
in a few hours, you're gonna pass out some more.
mom's gonna get a phone call and tell me that she's gotta go out and get milk or eggs for the morning, but really she's going out to get you from wherever.
and when she gets home, she's gonna take a shower so no one in the house can hear her crying.
he tried to tell me the truth.
that he had visions, too?
Yeah.
I know what I have to do.
bet you didn't see this one comin'.
this is true.
I thought Sweren wouldn't crack until at least tomorrow.
wait. Give me a minute.
I don't have an obnoxiousark prepared.
got it.
you didn't have any trouble finding your way here, did you?
I know the elevator ride can disorienting for someone used to living and working in a basent.
funny.
thank you.
almost as hilarious as the phone call I got this morning from my boss.
he just wanted to tell me that I had his full support in the turk case.
what, were you expecting him to, oh, I don't know, tell me to back off?
in fact, that was how the conversation started, until I presented him with the evidence.
I'm sorry I don't have an obnoxious remark prepar.
now you can't make out her face in every shot, but obviously, that's your client's wife obviously engaged in a series of acts with a consenting adult obviously not her husband.
all right, is this guy who I think it is?
well, that depends...
if you think that's the third base coach your client murdered.
these pictures could have been taken years ago.
the private investigator your client hired to take them will testify they weren't.
he hired a private investigator.
now clearly your client has been less than candid.
makes you wonder what else he might now be telling you, huh?
you were right.
I was wrong.
this isn't negligent homicide.
it's premeditated murder.
you are crazy. The--it was an accident.
an accident where your client just happens to kill the guy screwing his wife.
keep the photos. I got plenty of copies.
don't say it.
say what?
how glad I am that I have you to show me how things get done uptown?
Yeah.
the partners believe that your aneurysm, coupled with the erratic behavior it appears to produce, is grounds for disbarment.
if you want to drop out, I would, of course, understand.
that's big of you, Eli.
but when I take on a case, I take it on to win.
I actually have an idea about how to do that.
but if you don't want me to say
you're a smart attorney, Eli.
if I feel betrayed...
and I do, it's only because I saw in you a piece of myself.
given that symosis, I suspect we've both arrived at the same conclusion.
the aneurysm doesn't hurt our case.
the aneurysm is our case.
a brain aneurysm.
Mr. Stone, a senior associate at my firm, was diagnosed with one approximately two months ago.
in that time, the aneurysm's side effects have been certain behavioral eccentricities, but neither they nor his aneurysm have impred his ability to practice one iota.
they didn't prevent him from graduating from stanford, clerking at the supreme court or representing hundreds of clients with distinction at one of this country's most prestigious firms.
Mr. Stone's focus has been sharpened by the possibility of a painful and premature death.
as a member of the bar,
I am embarrassed by the disciplinary actions it has taken against my colleague, my associate, and that is why I felt it my obligation to draft and file a lawsuit against the state bar association for violations of the federal americans with disabilities act on mr. Stone's behalf.
I'll take your questions now.
listen to me.
listen real hard.
now whatever you say to us right now may be privileged, but we are still stuck with it for trial.
you tell us you did this, we--we can't go and argue to a jury you didn'T.
you feel me?
so if I want to lie, now would be the time?
you need a minute?
no, I don't need a minute, because I don't need to lie,
because I didn't do anything.
except hire a private investigator...
except find out your wife cheated on you with the guy you killed.
accidentally killed.
look, you think I did this?
you really think I did this?
I think if you could aim your hits like this, your on-base percentage would be
but that doesn't change the fact the A. D.A thinks otherwise.
and he's gonna send some badges to your home, and they're gonna put you in the back of a squad car in front of your neighbors.
our firm's got some pull with the D. A.
we've arranged to have you surrender to the police.
no arrest.
surrender?
they will process you through central booking
So...I'm...
I'm like a criminal here?
we're gonna get you through this, jayson, as painless as possible.
it's too damn late for that, mr. Dowd.
congratulations, Mr. Wethersby.
since your press conference, I've been besieged with phone calls.
your honor's summary ruling left us with no other option.
fine.
my summary ruling is hereby withdrawn.
the hearing will continue.
call your next witness.
since ms. Raines rested her case, I see no reason not to rest as well.
we can proceed directly to summations.
Mr. Stone will be speaking on his own behalf.
go on, Eli.
they need to hear from you why you want this and to be reminded how good you are at it.
I was a very good lawyer before all of this, and I think I would have grown into a great lawyer.
but I wouldn't have been a great person.
two months ago, I cared about winning my cases.
but now I-I care about helping my clients.
and how much help can you be to them if you die in the middle of their case?
well, probably not that much.
but until that happens...
I know that each case could be my last...
and I try that much harder.
I take cases that are that much more important to me...
and I think I'm a better lawyer for it.
Yes, my behavior has been a little odd, but odd isn't always worse.
my father had the same condition, and it didn't prevent him from raising his two sons
one who became a doctor and another who became a lawyer.
and being a lawyer is all I ever wanted to be.
one day, I may have to stop being one, but that's not today.
today I could still do some good.
all I'm looking for from this hearing is...the chance to keep doing it.
this case presents a simple question
does Mr. Stone's aneurysm render him unfit to practice law?
Mr. Stone is concerned it might.
what other explanation can there be for the lengths to which he's gone to hide his condition?
Mr. Stone, please.
your subterfuge is inconsistent with the ideals of the bar.
I am therefore sanctioning you, sir, and I am fining you $1, 000.
beyond that, however, I see no evidence that your condition has rendered you unfit to practice.
therefore, to protect you and the interests of your clients, every three months you will submit to a medical exam administered by a physician...who is not a relative.
and you will also have regular psychiatric evaluations to determine if your ability to practice law has been compromised.
so long as it has not, you may retain your license.
I wish you well, young man.
we are adjourned.
sir?
good luck to you, mr. Stone.
I had 50 bucks going the other way.
I'll make it up to you.
no more perjury would be nice.
so you probably have a few hundred questions.
you know, the strange thing is, as hard as it was to keep the secret from people here, it was oddly kind of hardest to keep it from you...
which surprid me, because
you're an ass.
because you think I'm an ass.
I thought you changed.
I thought you realized all by yourself that it's not enough to be a good lawyer if you're not also a good person.
but you're the same selfish, self-centered lawyer you always were.
all that's changed now is that you're trying to clean up your record just in case there's a hereafter.
no, I'm not.
I-I did this whole thing on a mountaintop with a coffee can
if you didn't know about the aneurysm, would you have ever even looked at a pro bono client?
would you have ever even helped me?
I rest my case.
you really have a way with women.
I'm not sure how it happened, but I think my having an aneurysm pisses her off!
not just her.
jordan wants you in his office.
are you in pain?
excuse me?
your aneurysm--does it cause you any physical discomfort?
no, sir.
I understand why you lied to me.
I probably would have done the same thing in your position.
but that doesn't change the fact that you kept secret a condition that could have exposed this firm to a catastrophic malpractice suit.
I realize that I was
I'm talking right now, mr. Stone.
I like being lied to only less than I appreciate my life's work being threatened by selfishness.
I won't tolerate it within these walls, and I won't put my money in such a person's pocket.
you're firing me?
I can't fire you.
even if I could get around the language of the keller settlement,
I couldn't discharge the very attorney whose frdom to practice I so publicly championed.
bottom line
I'm obligated to keep employing you.
what I'm not obligated to do is provide you with an office, an assistant or a caseload.
I'm not obligated to treat you with respect, and I'm not obligated to maintain a professional or personal relationship with you.
we're done.
you want me to talk to him?
no, I made my bed.
I don't know where to put it without an office, but...
Yeah, that's actually what want to talk to my father about.
you're the new tenant.
it's--it's wrong, and I-I shouldn't even-- - no.
no, this way it stays in the family.
it's just an office.
the important thing is I'm still a lawyer.
you remember my first day here?
you were jordan's assistant, and I parked in his space by accident not even for 15 minutes, and, uh, and you
I had you towed. - Yeah.
and I thought, "I am keeping my distance from her."
Patti, for what it's worth, I didn't get Jordan to represent me.
Taylor did.
all right.
I'll be just down the hall.
Taylor Wethersby's office.
pretty lousy day?
well, the good news is I still have my dignity.
Oh, no, wait. I forgot.
I lost that too.
I suppose it wouldn't help to remind you there's a higher plan to all this.
Oh，I believe it.
and if the plan is to massivelscrew up my life, I-I think it's going pretty well.
it's understandable to be bitter, Eli.
I'm not bitter.
I'm relieved.
ever since I was diagnosed, I've been afraid of becoming like my dad, you know?
this pathetic guy who couldn't hold his life together with both hands.
now...
here I am.
your father may have beenelad, EiI.
he might even have been a little lost, but he was never pathetic.
Yeah, well, you didn't know him.
remember when I told you at first, I couldn't get any work as an acupuncturist?
I was just out of my 20s, and all I had was a dog-eared copy of The I Ching.
and my collection of C. C.R. Records.
as in creedence clearwater- - clearwater revival.
want to guess what my favorite song was?
who'll stop the rain?
anyway...
I was out of school, I just got back from beijing, and I couldn't get hired to stick needles in pincushions.
so I took this job at a tv repair shop.
it was the only job I could get, and I was grateful.
I asked the man I worked for what I could do to repay his kindness.
and he told me about his son, who was away at college at the time.
he told me that I would make good on my debt to him one day.
what are you...
what are you telling me?
I didn't know what your dad meant, how I could help you.
but three months ago, you walked into my office.
he saw the future...
just like he said he could.
what do you think of that higher plan now?
All-ar catcher jayson turk hit a foul ball which struck his coach in the head...
fatally.
they got his own wife testifying against him.
I thought wives couldn't testify against their husbands.
get down!
you know I've been seeing things lately.
I'm starting to think that they're 'cause of my aneurysm.
maybe I did the wrong thing, breaking up with her.
our client feels he needs a high-profile attorney.
like it or not, eli's profile keeps getting higher.
Ylor, you'll stay on as co-counsel.
what?
it's like I see things now
things that were always there but that I just never noticed before.
today will be a good day.
I can see the day being a good day...
very good day.
see it. Believe it. Achieve it.
there will be no george michael songs.
there will be no World War II battlefields.
fire-breathing dragons will not take up residence in my clos.
Oh, my god!
not the plasma!
Earthquake! Earthquake!
nice duck.
not in the mood, Eli.
come on, Patti. An earthquake hits.
you only have time to save one thing.
what do you pick?
a heavy, blunt object to hit you with.
now I know better than to expect warm cuddlies from you, but for the past week you've been treating me worse than jordan, and that's saying something.
Really?
and what changed a week ago, I wonder.
is this about Solinsky?
it's about you representing that scum-sucking lizard.
well, if it bothers you so much, why didn't you say something?
like what?
that you're lower than dick cheney's bunion to be his lawyer?
come on. He's just a developer.
he's developing my friends and family straight out of their homes. Why?
well, so he can gentrify the neighborhood by building high-rise condos around a retail destination.
you mean shopping malls
a mall where rich, white people ride little trolleys from pottery barn to barnes & noble so their rich, white feet don't get tired.
I made a deal with jordan.
I take the case, I get you back as my assistant.
Oh, I mean that much to you?
Yes, you do.
then you shouldn't be helping somebody bulldoze my old neighborhood!
what's going on?
um, let's see.
another celebutante got photographed getting out of her car without her panties on, - and I think we're still in iraq-- - no, I mean with you.
you've been acting weird all week, and...
I mean, weird for you, which is weird.
I'm fine, but thanks for your show of gentle concern.
Yove been avoiding me.
we're talking to each other right now, so I guess I'm not really doing a good job of it.
Maggie, you've been acting strange ever since the kiss.
why don't you just put it on a billboard?
look, first of all, I'm not acting strange or weird since......
the thing.
the thing"?
second of all, I'm not even thinking about the thing.
I have a boyfriend.
okay, great,'cause it seemed like you were upset.
I'm fine. I'm just-- - Eli?
Oh, I wanted to talk to you before we met with Solinsky, but it looks like I'm interrupting something.
no, you're interrupting nothing. - No, nothing.
let's go. Has the jury reach a verdict?
we have, your honor.
we, the jury in the above entitled action, on the charge of murder in the first degree, find the defendant jayson christopher turk not guilty.
what happens next?
in real life?
in real life, you'd be found not guilty by temporary insanity.
diminished capacity defense as a result of your steroid use, and you do probation for a year.
what about the league?
could go either way, but you're the best catcher in the game.
hall of fame, though?
I'm--I'm sorry.
you're thinking about the hall of fame?
hell, yeah, I'm thinkin' about it.
I've dedicated my life to that, and you guys have got me saying I'm a juicer.
because that's the most effective means of winning this case, Mr. Turk, as these mock trials have proved.
I'm going on trial for murder tomorrow.
which is precisely why I'm stepping in now.
and yourlient's worried that the cure might be worse than the disease.
there's nothing worse than maximum security for 25 to life.
nobody cares about your hall of fame status when is lights out on cellblock "B.
you with them on this?
Yeah.
because you don't have... any other options.
this doesn't have to be difficult.
of course not.
we're two adults who had a relationship which is now over by mutual agreement.
Noetrayal, no recrimination, no alienation of affection.
just an acknowledgment that it would be best if we were apart.
except for the fact that Solinsky and your father are making us work together.
did you review the city council transcripts?
Yeah. They approved the taking of Silver Terrace by eminent domain.
unanimous. Taylor, do you feel that?
I feel the earth move...under my feet I feel the sky tumblin' down...
no, you don'T.
I feel my heart start to tremblin' whenever you're around...
Ooh, darlin'...
when you're near me and you tenderly call my name...
I never did that. - I know that my emotions are something I just can't tame I just got to have you, baby I feel the earth move under my feet I feel the sky tumblin' down Tumblin' down I just lose control do I feel what, Eli?
how... great us working together is gonna be.
literally.
as if I don't have enough problems, now I'm getting serenaded by my ex and Maggie.
last time I checked, two seriously hot women singing to you?
not really a problem, dude.
it is if you work with both of them.
though I must say, their singing was surprisingly good.
the love triangle portion of the vision you can figure out with your therapist.
now let's talk about these recurring earthquakes.
it's easy.
for the past three months, my life's been falling apart.
now everything else is falling apart, too.
your visions aren't just a dvd commentary on your life.
in norse mythology, earthquakes are the result of Loki's punishment.
have you done anything lately you should be punished for?
well, I'm back on the side of evil this week.
I'm representing a real estate developer who's tearing down silver terrace.
Solinsky? That guy's a pig.
well, if you don't mind, I'm already getting an earful from patti.
lie down.
is it needle time?
I love needle time.
you're never allowed to call it "needleime" again.
now I should be able to help you relive your earthquake vision, like under hypnosis.
maybe you could notice some additional details.
if not, I just clear your sinuses.
maybe I could save the plasma.
God! Oh, my god!
the plasma!
Yeah!
special report.
the bay area is experiencing a major earthquake measuring 6. 5 on the richter scale.
the epicenter of the quake is located in Silver Terrace.
of course we'll have...
there was a news report.
silver terrace gets destroyed by an earthquake.
did it say when?
no, just that it's the epicenter of a 6. 5
so if you lose this case...
those people could die.
call solinsky.
tell him I want to meet with him right away.
then get jeffrey powell.
tell him I want to negotiate a settlement on the silver terrace case.
I'm gonna make this right, patti.
are you still representing Arvin Solinsky?
Yes.
are you still helping him to take my friendsnd families' homes and tear down my church?
so by "make this right," you mean you do the same exact thing you were doing before but with greater urgency?
Yes, but-- - no.
make your own damn calls.
we need to talk.
we've already talked. - No.
we didn't talk talk.
we talk talked enough for me.
so can I please go back to avoiding you and pretending like I'm not?
look, either you're a closet Carole King fan or you have a thing for me.
who's Carole King?
so you don't...
you don't have a crush on me?
not before, but that kind of modesty is such a turn-on.
fine. I'm wrong.
believe me, I'm--I'm glad to be wrong.
since my diagnosis, my life's gotten really mplicated, and I can't deal with any more complications.
we work together.
um, you report to me. Nothing romantic could ever happen between us.
you know that, right?
Yeah. Of--of course I do.
um, you came by my office?
She--her keyboard jammed.
Jayson Turk committed a crime... intentionally.
with malice aforethought, he killed another human being.
in front of 30, 000 fans and hundreds of cameras?
does that sound reasonable?
or does it sound like a man who's in an altered state and ouof his mind?
he wasn't out of his mind when he used steroids to bulk up to 245 pounds of solid muscle.
those same steroids altered his mental state, rendering him temporarily...
insane?
please, let's just call this what it is another excuse to let jayson turk get away with criminal behavior.
celebrities...
celebrities are no more entitled to break the law...are no less deserving of the presumption of innocence...than you or me.
and while steroid use is against the law, jayson turk isn't being prosecuted for that.
he's on trial for murder, and on that charge, he is innocent.
Mr. Solinsky, $20 million will make this lawsuit disappear.
I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the idea that the neighborhood can even sue me.
and now you want me to settle?
settling means avoiding a trial, which could delay the start of construction
or in this case, destruction-- for a month.
the city is already paying 'em for their properties.
and I'm suggesting you pay them a little more so they drop their suit and move out immediately.
the truth is, Arvin, it's better to weigh the pros and cons of settlement before trial.
the con would be that I pay the denizens of silver terrace $20 million out of my own pocket.
I'm not really seeing the pro.
well, doing the right thing.
the right thing?
I'm turning an urban blight into a clean, safe place.
the citizens who live there now won't be able to afford to park there in a year.
I'm really sorry, but this is how Silver Terrace's lawyer, Jeffrey Powell, is gonna paint you.
right now people still think you're a good guy, which I'm sure is true, arv, but this trial will be very bad for that perception.
you don't look that happy.
it's not exactly an overwhelming amount.
it's three times what the city already paid them, jeff.
which wasn't very much to begin with.
I don't know what Powellas promised you, but are you willing to bet $20 million that he's right?
we'd get this money on top of what the city already paid us?
those checks can't compensate for the loss of the homes you raised your children in, that you raised your grandchildren in.
the city says it can take away your community because the neighborhood is lost.
take this money, and you're agreeing with 'em.
I think you can tell your client his offer is rejected.
what were you doing back there?
just trying to undo powe's "power to the people" brainwashing.
arvin solinsky, please.
and what are you doing now?
um, I think I can get them to take $25 million.
it's Eli Stone calling.
or it was.
that was me making a call to Arvin.
to our client to get him to put up another $5 million.
he can cover I out of petty cash.
do you know it's malpractice to shove a settlement down his throat?
what is going on with you?
we can win this at trial.
a trial will take too long.
Solinsky can wait.
I can't. They can't.
Eli, what is happening?
whatever it is, you can tell me.
my visions...
tThey guide me.
they tell me what kinds of cases I should take or what I should do.
crazy, yeah, but it's the truth.
I saw myself take my dad's ashes to india.
I saw Jake Mccann die last month before it happened.
and two days ago, I saw silver terrace get destroyed by an earthquake.
if we don't get these people out of here-- - Eli, these things you're seeing are symptoms of your aneurysm.
I wish they were.
you need to get help.
that's not the kind of help I need right now.
Jayson and I have been married for five years.
obviously, though, it wasn't a perfect marriage.
no. There have been infidelities on both sides.
Jaon had his baseball groupies in I don't know how many cies.
and for the past six months, I had been involved with John Quesada, his third base coach.
why do you believe your husband murdered John Quesada?
sidebar, judge?
he is trying to elicit testimony from Mrs. Turk that the defendant threatened the victim's life.
I think Mr. Sweren needs to be reminded that what's said between a husband and wife is privileged.
no, I'm good, thanks.
Mrs. Turk can speak to Mr. Turk's character and capacity for murder.
agreed.
objection overruled. Step back.
Mrs. Turk, can you explain to the jury why you think he committed murder?
Jayson is a jealous man.
he's possessive and insecure.
he won't even permit me to have male friends.
was he this way before taking steroids?
Yes. It is who the man is.
did jayson ever raise a hand to you? - No.
how about fistfights, barroom brawls, anything like that?
no. Jealousy is jayson's hot button.
you also had affairs with Gerrit Wilson, Jim Wacker.
where might those men be buried?
they are still alive.
maybe that's because you had those affairs before jayson started using steroids.
for what it's worth, I'm sorry I sprung this on you right before trial.
moving forward, I'm going to insist that any further changes in strategy be run through me first.
I'm not crazy, Taylor.
Patti, what are you doing here?
my civic duty.
Powell subpoenaed you? - Yep.
he thinks I'll make a very convincing witness, and I also agree.
what was it like to grow up in Silver Terrace, Ms. Dellacroix?
no one had a lot, but what we had, we shared.
if you were short on grocery money, the church helped out.
if your gas was gonna be cut off, neighbors chipped in to pay the bills.
that spirit is still there.
you just have to look past the peeling paint.
Objection- - relevance.
the city exercised eminent domain because it designated silver terrace a "blight."
I'm exploring the veracity of that determination.
objection overruled.
back to the peeling paint-- what did you mean by that?
I mean the neighborhood has its problems, but it's still a long way from being written off for dead.
thank you, Ms. Dellacroix.
miss dellacroix, under the law,"blighted" has a specific legal meaning.
do you know what it is?
it was not!
I've been a legal secretary ever since you were an itch in your daddy's pants.
I know an objectionae question when I hear one.
ms. Dellacroix, could we leave the objecting to Mr. Powell, please?
of course.
I'm sorry, your honor.
how would you compare the silver terrace
I could not let that stand, judge.
maybe it'd be better if I did the cross-examination.
if you think you'll have betteruck, by all means.
if silver terrace is so alive with community spirit, why'd you move away?
I wanted a shorter commute to work, but it is still my church home.
when was the last time you were in silver terrace?
time flies. I...
I really don't remember.
do you remember getting carjacked down the street from the church?
I guess without a car, you really did need a shorter commute.
judge, you wanted to see me?
Ah, Mr. Stone.
walk with me.
this isn't ex parte, because it's not about the case.
it's about you.
obviously, I've heard about your recent trouble with the bar.
I guess that means you haven't been living under a rock.
obviously, I'm concerned you might use your illness as an excuse for some of the unusual behavior I hear you're prone to.
I would never do that, sir. - Good.
I admire your client solinsky.
he is a self-made man.
my son-in-w's a wannabe developer in san diego.
I imagine it'd mean the world to him to partnerwith an Arvin Solinsky.
well, unfortunately, there's only one, and he happens to be my client, so...
in fact, there's a project he could probably get off the ground if he had Solinsky as a partner.
I can't tell you how appreciative I'd be if you'd introduce my son-in-law to mr. Solinsky...
after the case is over, of course.
I'm sorry, judge salese.
I don't enjoy that kind of relationship with Mr. Solinsky.
are you sure about that?
I am, sir.
and I'm also sure that your request is a serious breach of ethics.
considering your recent trouble with the bar, who do you think they're gonna believe
me or you?
forget I said anything.
you have a good afternoon, Mr. Stone.
you too, sir.
I guess it's a question of what I'm willing to do to win.
this case isn't about winning or losing, Eli.
no, it's about saving lives and being a prophet.
God's go-to guy.
for someone who's been touched by divinity, you whine an awful lot.
possibly touched by a theoretical divinity, and anyway, bribing a judge doesn't really sound like a plan god would come up with.
mose was running from the law when he saw the burning bush.
martin luther broke the law by tralating the bible, d martin luther king broke a whole bunch of laws in civil disobedience.
for that matter, so did Gandhi, who, by the way, was also a lawyer.
I'm sorry. I'm not breaking any laws.
I'd never tell you to break the law, eli.
aren't you?
we gotta get out of here!
no, we don't! It's all in your...
dude, you've gotta calm down.
you okay?
I've never seen you when you're having one of your visions.
it's intense, bro!
you remember how I was hearing music?
do you think I could likely forget it?
you might not believe this part
just "this part"?
sometimes I have visions of the future.
am I being punk'd?
is that cute Ashton Kutcher gonna jump out here?
I hear he appreciates the mature woman.
Patti, ever since myneurysm, I've had certain gifts.
is this some lame attempt to get me to stop being mad at you?
no. I swear!
I saw an earthquake, and it destroys silver terrace.
that's why I'm helping Solinsky.
I have to get your former neighbors out.
Eli, if you are running a game on me, so help me, god
no, actually, it's-- it's god I'm trying to help.
that's who I think these visions are from.
even if you think I'm nuts, it doesn't change the fact that solinsky's settlement deal is a good one.
why would the association listen to me?
you're part of the community. They trust you.
you could get them to take the deal.
Eli, I-I- - I know.
I could be crazy.
but what if I'm not?
I wasn't in my right mind.
I don't even remember it happening.
aiming to hit john quesada?
any of it.
I remember looking down third base where john was, and...
and I snapped.
when you say you "snapped..."
I got angry.
it started in my gut, and it spread till I could taste the bile in my mouth, and the next thing, my head is spinning, and after that,
I honestly couldn't tell you what happened next.
I can.
you hit a line drive straight at John Quesada's head.
I know. I saw the tape.
that's gotta be hard to do when you're not in your right mind.
is counsel asking us or telling us?
were you taking performance-enhancing drugs the time john quesada died?
on the advice of counsel, I decline to answer.
I'll ask it another way.
let me see if I got this straight.
the steroids, which you conveniently won't admit to taking, put you in a rage, which conveniently killed the man who was having an affair with your wife, which conveniently you can't recall now.
I'm sitting in this chair on trial for my life, mr. Sweren.
there isn't anything "convenient" about this for me.
redirect, your honor?
Mr. Turk, John Quesada was sleeping with your wife, and you knew about it.
do you expect this jury to believe that what befell him was just an unfortunate accident?
obviously, some part of me wanted to end the man.
bui swear to god, I never intended to do him any harm.
the defense rests, your honor.
the people intend to call a rebuttal witness, your honor.
who?
Carly turk. - Sidebar, your honor.
I fail to see how Ms. Turk can elaborate any further on the testimony she's already given.
unless the D. A.'S trying to circumvent spousal privilege and get mr. Turk's threat in through some kind of back door.
suspicious much?
suspicious a lot. - Cut it out.
if mr. Sweren wants to recall a witness, I can't stop him.
but if carly turk so much as repeats what the defendant mumbled in his sleep,
I'm holding you in contempt.
what's going on?
Powell called and said he wanted a meeting.
which one of you got to my clients?
what are you talkingbout, jeff?
the residents of silver terrace had a sudden and inexplicable change of heart.
they'd like to accept mr. Solinsky's offer and dismiss the case.
could we have a moment with our client?
I don't think we should settle.
what?
this is the same offer we were willing to make three days ago.
you said the offer was a good idea.
when it would avoid going to trial, but we're here anyway, and now I think we can win.
our chances of winning are 50/50 at best.
and I can't recommend a $20 million payout on top of attorney's fees you're already incurring with those odds.
you're right.
Mr. Solinsky
Eli, I know you want to settle, and I respect your point of view, but Taylor's right.
if they wanted me to write them a check, they should have taken the money while they had the chance.
Thanks, taylor.
Taylor, what the hell?
I know you're angry, but I am looking out for our client's best interests, not tryingo evacuate silver terrace because I think I can see the future.
okay, now we have to win this in court.
I'm glad we're on the same page.
you can tell arvin I'll be closing.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
even if you don't believe me that these people are in danger, believe that i believe it.
so between us, who do you think wants to win this thing more?
all he ever wanted to do was win.
I think he felt like he had to compete with the other players who were juicing.
to your knowledge, was he taking steroids on the day John Quesada died?
I saw him give himself two injections.
immediately, his mood changed.
but he still seemed in control of his actions? - He was very angry.
his temper was flaring.
were you in fear for your safety?
no.
but I was afraid for john.
Jason said he was gonna kill him. - Mrs. Turk!
move for an immediate mistrial, your honor.
clear the courtroom now!
that was a privileged conversation, the contents of whh are completely prejudicial.
I specifically told her not to break privilege.
sure, you did.
look, there's no reason for a mistrial.
the jury can be instructed to ignore mrs. Urk's statement.
no instruction, no matter how forceful, could persuade a jury to ignore that statement!
I hate granting mistrials, mr. Wethersby...
almost as much as I hate unfair trials.
if you declare a mistrial, your honor, Jason can't be tried again.
it's double jeopardy.
it doesn't apply in the case of a mistrial.
it does when the mistrial arises out of prosecutorial miscouct.
he's been dead set on winning this any way he can.
court may grant you qualified immunity against a slander suit, but that doesn't mean I won't file one.
you boys want to take a ruler to the men's room and measure yourself, fine, but keep it out of my courtroom.
I want to talk to Carly Turk.
then I'll make my ruling.
arvin solinsky, pillar of the community.
just not the community he's trying to bulldoze.
talking to yourself?
not a good sign.
neither is the fact that I'm gonna choke on the biggest closing in my entire life.
don't you think that's a little overdramatic?
it's real estate, not life and death.
you'd be surprised.
what is it, Eli?
I can't tell you.
if I tell you, you're gonna think I'm insane, just like everyone else.
maybe, but I can't help you if you don't talk to me.
if I don't win this case, the people of silver terrace
or at least a lot of them are gonna die in an earthquake.
how do you know they'll die?
don't ask me how I know, Maggie, I just do.
okay.
okay?
you believe me?
why wouldn't I?
well, I don't know
because someone saying they can see the future is ludicrous?
well, good thing you didn't just tell you.
you really b-- you really believe me?
I'm not saying you can see the future.
but since I've gotten to know you, you've been nothing but honest and sincere...
and, yeah, totally obnoxious.
but if you tell me something, I believe it's true.
I told my brother.
I told Pat... Taylor.
none of them believe me.
you didn't evehesitate.
you know, you're pretty amazing.
Eli, no.
I'm sorry.
look, you can't have it both ways, Eli.
you said nothing could happen.
I know. I did. I'm sorry.
so we agreed there's a line.
please just... stop crossing it!
the rule of double jeopardy, that a defendant cannot be tried twice, does not apply in the case of a mistrial, except when the mistrial is the result of prosecutorial misconduct, as alleged by the defense here.
I've spoken privately with mrs. Turk, and she confessed to me that her spontaneous outburst of privileged information was, in fact, a planned statement coached by the assistant district attorney.
your honor, she's lying!
she's your witness, counsel, and you don't want to be ticking me off any more than I already am.
I'm finding there was prosecutorial misconduct in this case.
jeopardy attaches, and the defendant cannot be tried again.
accordingly, this matter is dismissed with prejudice.
Mr. Turk, see probation.
then you're free to go.
Mr. Turk?
bigger than the world series, mr. Wethersby. Bigger.
congratulations, man.
ready for the cameras?
the term "born ready" comes to mind.
Mr. Turk! - Jayson, jayson!
how does it feel now that you're acquitted? - How does it feel now?
now that the evidence is closed, if there's no objection, I'm ready to render my decision.
you don't want to hear final arguments, your honor?
I don't believe they'll materially affect my ruling, mr. Powell.
the supreme court has ruled that expanding tax revenue is in the public interest.
and city officials here have decided that's what mr. Solinsky's project will do.
if this is not what the residents of the city want, they can vote their elected representatives out.
bui am bound to uphold their decision.
judgment for the defendant.
T. R.O. Is hereby lifted, and I am issuing a minute order instructing the residents of silver terrace to vacate...
what?
with all deliberate speed!
all right, sign here... and initial here.
that's it.
your major league suspension's officially lifted. Batter up.
Thanks, bro.
before we're done, uh...
I brought you a little somethin'.
thought I'd get a head start on the divorce pleading before carly had time to hide any assets.
it's just another signature.
look, guys...
I think we're gonna try to work it out.
there's still a lot of love there, you know?
no, I don'T.
she cheated on you and tried to stick you in prison.
I mean, how much love could we be talking about here?
the D. A. didn't conspire with Carly to blurt out the threat on the stand, did he?
she conspired with you.
you're worth more to her as a catcher on the outside than a catcher on the inside.
it was smart. I mean, all she had to do was have a "spontaous outburst" on the stand and say sweren coached her, and you get a mistrial. Jeopardy attaches.
you walk clean.
you know why you loved that 'roid rage defense so much?
because it fit your picture of who I was.
you thought I was stupid.
you were wrong.
I shouldave seen it.
SWEREN may be a bottom-feeder, but he's not a cheater.
you are.
rules are for other people. Right?
I was about to lose everything.
great players perform undepressure.
I did what I had to do.
we done?
Oh, yeah. We're done.
Thanks, brah.
I couldn't have done it without you.
now woulnot be a good time to say,"I told you so.
actually, it is.
you fought me this whole time, like I was the bad guy for not getting on the Jayson Turk bandwagon.
if it'd been any other guy, same set of facts, we'd have been on the same page from jump.
I get it. I'm a jerk because I believed him.
no, you're a jerk because you didn't believe me.
makes you feel any better, you know, people will figure it out when they see him with carly.
I'm not the only person who can add two plus two.
no. No, he'll get away with it.
that's what he does.
Congratulations.
to you, too.
I'm not sure I had anything to do with it.
do you have any idea Wharvin asked me for the phone number of judge Salese's son-in-law?
no idea.
that's funny,'cause arvin said you would.
something about a meeting you arranged?
he was under the assumption I knew about it.
Eli, tell me you didn't do anything crazy to win this case.
you know, now's really not a good time.
I promised maggie I would proof her summary judgment motion.
so I suppose you'll be catching a flight to Ohio?
she sent out an office-wide e-mail.
she went home to ohio for a week.
but I guess you don't know anything about that either.
I just want you to know I'm not coming back into the office today.
where are you?
my church.
you know, the one you're getting torn down.
no, patti, not the church.
There--there's gonna be an earthquake, and you...
what are you doin' here?
you've gotta get out of here. - Why?
this place isn't getting demolished until next week, and it's not like anything else is bringing it down.
no earthquake.
where is it, eli?
I-I... I don't know.
it may come tomorrow or in a few days.
or a few months or a few years, maybe?
the last time I came he, I prayed for my father.
he was in the hospital.
he didn't make it.
and I have not been able to walk through those doors since.
I just-- I couldn't believe anymore.
but you said god was talkin' to you, and I thought maybe
I did see you in here.
you don't see anything, eli.
God doesn't talk to you.
you're sick, and you need to get better.
you're the one I was praying for this time.
are you certain?
he stopped short of admitting it, but yeah, I'm sure.
I see.
you understand, however, that there's nothing we can do?
Yes, there is.
we can kick him to the curb. - Excuse me?
drop him as a client right now. We don't take another penny.
you're talking about hundreds of milons of pennies in commissions and fees.
his agent just sent over his latest endorsement contract.
I know.
you've never demonstrated a particularly active conscience, mr. Dowd.
this isn't finding a tax loophole so some billionaire can save $5, 000, sir.
I-it's a human being killing another human being and making this firm an accomplice after the fact
your firm. My firm.
I really don't think that's what you want this place to be.
I know I don't.
you really feel that strongly about it?
I do.
for some time, I've made no secret of the fact that
I saw eli as my heir apparent at this firm.
it is also no secret that his status has changed.
and where he has fallen short, you've risen to the occasion.
but I never saw the leadership qualities in you that I saw in him...
until now.
we'll drop mr. Turk as our client effective immediately.
thank you, sir.
I was just closing up.
Patti's at the silver terrace church.
you know, just like in my vision.
while I was there, I just--I...
I couldn't help but notice a distinct lack of earthquake.
maybe the earthquake was metaphorical.
maybe because you got the people out, - you prevented the whole thing from happening. - Maybe, maybe, maybe.
God works in mysterious ways. Ours is not to reason why.
for a god who seems to want people to believe in him, you'd think he'd offer up some evidence, some proof of his almighty existence.
that's what faith is, eli-- belief in the absence of proof.
I keep waiting for some small confirmation that there is a god, that I haven't just destroyed my life for nothing.
are you gonna stand here and telle there was more meaning in your paycheck than in the people you've helped lately?
could you have done any of that without faith?
I did it all without faith!
I did it with-- with my law license...
the one I pissed on yesterday!
what about all the things you've learned about yourself, your--your father, me? Was that all some coincidence?
if that is proof that god is behind everything that's happening to me, then it also means that he wanted me to hurt the people who love me the most...
that he wanted me to break their hearts, break the law!
he wanted me to force people out of their homes!
I'm sorry, man.
that is not any kind of god I want to believe in.
I know how hard this is for you
you can't even begin to know!
none of this is real.
none of this is because of god.
it's been my aneurysmthe whole damn time, and it's gonna stop!
I'm gonna find a surgeon, and I'm goa get this thing out of my head as soon as possible!
Eli, that surgery could kill you.
if I don't get it out now,
I-I won't have anything left to live for anyway.
you know I'v been seeing things lately.
uh, when do you take it out?
given the location of the aneurysm, surgery is a bad idea.
who's that? - Beth keller
the Beth that was your first at bat?
I feel awful.
and you broke up with me.
you wanna grab a drink?
so Stone's out and Dowd's in.
U're firing meme? - I can't.
what I'm not obligatedo do is provide you with an office or an assistant.
it's been my aneurysm the whole damn time, and I'm gonna get thishing ouof my head!
that surgery could kill you!
I won't have anything left to live for anyway.
there's gotta be a less humiliating outfit
something that closes in the back, at least.
I overheard one of the nurses saying she thought your butt was cute.
come on. Don't be nervous.
all we're doing is talking about surgery ony brai what's therehere toto be nervous about?
blindness. - Coma.
long-term memory loss.
sure, I can remove it.
it's no biggie.
you've found your man. - Really?
that's fantastic. - Told you.
just out of cuosity, how attached are you to your ability to speak?
so I'd be a vegetable.
I wouldn't use the word "vegetable."
well, I was combining blindness, paralysis and permanent brain damage into one easy-to-remember category.
didn't you mention some hospital in China?
Tin-tin puma?
tiantan puhua.
and the news won't sound any better in mandarin.
look, eli, are you sure this is something you really want?
if the something is ending up a drooling idiot, then no.
but if it means getting the brain defect removed from my head that's making my life a living hell, then yes.
well, the good news is you're already a drooling idiot, so the only thing left to do is pick a surgeon for the other thing.
out of those guys?
they didn't seem like they could remove a cap from a pen.
they're the best neurosurgeons I could get you in with.
well, now let's try the ones that you couldn't get me in with.
all right, there's one-- Sanjay Rajapaksa, but he doesn't take walk-ins.
he only handles cases originating from his own hospital.
or he did, until you applied your copious powers of persuasion.
all right, all right, I'll make a call.
you're the best. Thank you.
mm, n't thank me. I just don't want to spend the rest of my life wiping drool off your chin.
what are you doing at the hospital?
I, um... I'm sorry.
I just didn't expect to see you.
I'm bringing Ben to the doctor.
you know he's not with you, right?
Yes, he's... at the psychologist.
they work one-on-one for an hour, individual counseling.
so how are you?
I saw you on the news.
I was gonna call, but I figured, you know, you have enough on your plate.
Yeah, I've been better.
I, uh... I got demoted.
I lost my office.
I had a fight with my acupuncturist/spiritual guide.
I alienated the one person at work who mistakenly admired me and made a serious ethical breach which helped get several hundred people kicked out of their homes...
and I-I broke up with Taylor.
that's... oh, Eli.
if you ever need to talk, you still have my number, right?
Yeah.
I might just give you a call. - okay.
Bye.
you'll never guess who I ran into.
come on, patti, guess.
you're not patti.
no, um, I'm Bradley Kitsis.
I'm your temp.
Where's patti?
she's not here.
I noticed.
I can see, radley, at least for now.
Oh, she left me this note to read to you.
Uh,"eli, I'm taking a personal week..." - personal week?
to look after my friends and relatives "in silver terrace who, thanks to you, now have no homes.
no homes" is in capital letters, which is why I...
Thanks, Brad. I got it.
our billables are up by 10% this quarter
an increase almost entirely due to our success in the Solinsky case.
I can't help but swell with fatherly pride.
I had a lot of help.
perhaps you'd willing to apply your deft touch to judge doyle.
this being "Doyle the Ill."
good luck.
judge Doyle has just retained W. P.K. in connection with a personal medical crisis.
is he finally getting the pole removed from his rectum?
I hear that can be a painful procedure.
not nearly as painful as leukemia, mr. Dowd.
judge doyle needs a bone marrow transplant to treat his cancer, but his only donor match backed out of the donation agreement yesterday.
and now that we've established your sensitivity to the judge's plight, you can assist Taylor.
sir, Doyle the-- uh, judge Doyle hates me.
I'm sure you're familiar withmy "I could care less" face.
moving on to other outstanding business...
I can't light no more of your darkness all my pictures seem to fade to black and white. It's much too late to save myself from falling closed the door and left me blinded by the light. Ladies and gentlemen-- Mr. George Michael!
Oh, no. It's not.
Oh, no, it's not what?
are you Eli Stone?
I'm George Michael.
would--would you mind not poking me, please?
well, I'm sorry, it's just, you know, you're very solid for a vision.
and you're a very odd man.
well, at least I'm not a hallucination.
well, he can see me.
Adley, do you see me talking to anyone?
real life? Actual person?
of course I do, sir. That's bono.
Yeah, it happens all the time.
I had the glasses first, by the way.
mind you, bono and I do have something in common in that we are both perfectly visible.
I'm sorry. I think I've been wasting your time, mr. Stone.
no, no, no. Please, please, please, uh, stay. I...
I'm sorry. I just don't
I don't typically get visits like this one.
what can I do for you, Mr. Michael?
call me George.
um, well, I want you to take a case for me.
I found this in the Times.
it's about a young girl who was thrown out of her high school for playing one of my songs at a school "abstinence" assembly.
of course. This was all over the news.
what was the song again?
uh,"I want your sex."
sorry, you're not my type. It was a joke.
anyway, uh, I want to hire you to help her get back in.
now obviously I'll cover all the legal fees, mr. Stone.
call me Eli, and this is very generous of you.
obviously, I wouldn't, uh...
I couldn't say no to you. So...
if you don't mind me asking...
why me?
why did you come to me?
well, you might think I'm the odd one now.
but the other night I had a dream, and, um, in the dream, I was completely lost, uh, when someone told me I needed to find a lawyer named eli stone.
Mr. Wethersby?
you were looking for me, sir?
that would be inconsistent with the termination of our relationship, now wouldn't it?
I just heard that you wanted to see me, sir.
maybe bradley meant Mr. Posner.
no, he meant me.
I just didn't want you inferring that I actually craved this conversation.
nevertheless, I understand that you've been retained by--who was it again?
george michael, the pop superstar?
Yes, sir, unless there's a problem with that.
there is, actually-- two problems, in fact.
for one thing, you're still on probation.
secondly, section 6. 3 paragraph "j" of the partnership agreement obligates a partner to oversee any case where the client has a high public profile.
well, I guess it's good then that george isn't technically the client.
her name is Molly Foster.
she is 17 and much less famous, sir.
I don't have all day to waste on semantics.
if someone of mr. Michael's esteem is involved in this case, then obviously the requirement to oversee applies.
including appearing in court?
and managing client relations, yes.
okay, then. Welcome to the case.
I'm sure mr. Michael will appreciate having a senior partner on his team.
as will Molly, sir. - Who?
our client, Molly Foster.
right. Right.
I didn't expect this from Jordan Wethersby.
I ask him to send me his best lawyers.
he sends me a girl.
well, let me introduce you to mr. Wethersby's daughter, sir.
I wasn't talking about her, Dowd.
good to see you, Taylor.
so let's get to it.
so you're worried about the, uh, lack of legal precedent?
no, I'm worried about the lack of precedent in our favor.
well, that's why I pay the 2 of you $550 an hour.
I know this is a long shot, but I have no choice.
I'm dying.
leukemia proessed to stageour.
nowhere to go but down.
did you tell the would-be donor?
no, mr. Dowd.
I want him to think I need the painful extractions of his bone marrow for my personal collection.
usually only family members are an exact match.
the would-be donor is a relative, isn't he?
my son.
and he knows you're dying, and he still won't help you?
we aren't exactly close.
he was 2 when himother and I divorced, and I haven't seen scott since then.
so the settlement conference we're scheduled to have in an hour is the first time you're seeg your son in 19 years?
okay!
I'll have all the sharp objects removed from the conference room.
this is a critical meeting, obviously.
it's important that you let me do the talking, get us off on the right foot with mary.
Molly, sir. - Understandably, she'll be reluctant to dive into the legal waters, but- - Eli!
George, hello again.
I'm sorry. I'm not too late, am I? You're just off to see molly?
exactly. No, you're just in time. - Cool.
this is the firm's senior partner, Jordan Wethersby.
he's gonna be tting us off on the right foo good to meet you, mr. Wethersby.
Yes, it's, um...
an honor, Mr. Michael. - Yeah. Call me George.
it's good to see you again.
you make it sound like we just saw each other last week.
why don't we all sit down?
have you had a chance to review our proposal?
Yes.
this isn't...
I don't care about the money.
well, unless I'm mistaken, judge doyle already prevailed upon your more noble instincts.
I took the test.
doctors started to describe the procedure to me, and I guess I had second thoughts, okay?
I'm sorry.
I mean, it's not like I even know you or anything.
I know. I know, and I'm sorry.
I truly am.
but I'm asking for your help here.
and believe me when I tell ya, that's not something that comes easy for me.
I went through this phase where I'd send you things
letters, report cards. What did you ever do with those things anyway?
I thought...
I thought I shouldn't promise a relationship I couldn't deliver on.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I guess I can't deliver now.
sorry.
I don't think we'll be settling.
you are a dead ringer.
it's amazing.
mom, you have to see this George Michael impersonator chloe hired!
it's hilarious.
Hi, molly. It's great to meet you.
I've read about your expulsion from school, and I've hired these attorneys to help you get back in.
shut up.
no way. Please come in.
Oh, can I get you gentlemen anything? Coffee?
maybe something british-- some crumpets or a pint of bitters?
no, thank you. That's fine.
sir, you're unusually quiet. Are you feeling okay?
I feel fine. Don't ever touch me again.
so you totally read about me? - Yep.
that is so cool.
why don't you tell us exactly what happened at school?
there was this, um, lame-ass assembly
the "abstinence only" assembly?
twice a semester, some expert in never, ever having sex tells us all about it.
after two years of this, um, bull, I decided to take a stand.
I snuck into the principal's office d played "I want your sex" er the P. A.
the challenge here will be circumventing the supreme court's decision in Morse vs. Frederick, which limits the right to free speech on school grounds.
so you're saying I could lose?
always a possibility in litigation, ms. Foster, but...
you gotta have "faith."
another one of your songs, I think.
Oh, that's right, yeah.
excuse me.
Hey, it's me.
I just got off the phone with Rajapaksa.
you remember? Super neurosurgeon?
well, uh, it took a lot of begging and a new set of golf clubs, but...
he's agreed to see you.
obviously, it's a risk either way you slice it.
actually, there won't be any slicing involved.
we burn it out of you.
that's just what I always wanted.
so you guys will talk and let me know?
Yeah, we'll call you later.
thank you so much, dr. Rajapaksa.
anytime.
awesome.
okay, there is an O. R. Free week after next with your name on it.
you sure that's the guy?
well, he's competent, confident, expert in the latest techniques.
Eli, if he were any more qualified, he'd be a fictionatv character.
I'm not asking for a description of him.
I'm asking if you think that's the guy.
I can't make that choice for you, eli. I...
it's too big. I...
you're the only one who can do that.
you want this thing out or not
I want it out. I just--I'm not sure that this is the right time.
I'm having a strange week.
well, coming from you, that's saying something.
george michael showed up at my office-- for real this time
don't joke--the same day I happened to bump into Beth, and she has kind of a connection with him.
Yeah. Her son sees a doctor at this hospital.
I was thinking of giving her a call.
a-a call like
like a date, yes. - Yeah.
why not?
I'm newly single, about to be aneurysm-free.
well, yeah, but...
but what?
nothing.
I just, you know, be careful, all right?
I know I'm not the reason my parents split up and my father left, but when you're a kid, that's howt feels, you know, like it's your fault.
but now you have a chance at-- at reconciling with your father.
if I give him my bone marrow.
what kind of relationship do we stand to have with those kinds of strings attached?
I'm curious.
how do you even know whether you're a compatible donor?
I got tested.
three months ago, he called me up.
no "how are you?
no "sorry I wrote you off.
Just,"I've got canc. Would you get your blood tested?""
I take it the test determined that you are indeed a compatible donor?
Yes, I'm a match.
hoping the family similarities end there.
why go through the steps of having yourself tested if you're not prepared to go through with the donation?
is it because maybe you have an obligation to your father, however estranged he may be?
I got tested because...
I wanted to see if I was a match.
I wanted to see if I could save your life...
so I could tell you to go choke on it.
my reasons were just.
I knew I'd get in trouble.
I just didn't think I'd be expelled.
did you not know that school policy gives the principal discretion to expel anyone whose--whose behavior "materially interferes with the learning of other students or disrupts the overall education process"?
Yes, but that assumes what was happening at the assembly was learning.
the abstinence-only lady tells us condoms don't work, that girls who have abortions are more prone to suicide.
and because of all of those misconceptions, students in abstinence-only programs are less likely to use contraception.
objection. Are we to accept Miss Foster as an expert witness?
the plaintiff's knowledge-- or, I submit, lack thereof-- goes to the merits or the very pedagogy Miss Foster's protest was taking issue with.
miss foster, please limit your answers to your direct experiences.
Molly, how has the school's policy affected you?
first, my lab partner got pregnant.
then, um, a friend--I don't want to tell her name, 'cause her mom would totally kill her
she got gonorrhea... in her throat.
I decided I had to do something.
thank you, molly.
very descriptive.
and the "something" you cided to do was to play the song "I want your sex" at a school assembly?
that's a very mature form of political protest.
the execution of ms. Foster's protest isn't at issue here, only whether it's protected under our country's most cherished constitutional principles.
is that an objection?
a strenuous one, your honor.
sustained.
there was no other course of action?
you couldn't have organized a petition?
I wanted to expose the hypocrisy.
and when you did, do you think you were being disruptive?
I hope so.
thank you.
no further questions.
that was invigorating.
it reminded me of my salad days
standing up, making a compelling objection...
right in the middle of my direct examination.
on an issue of real significance-- not just freedom of speech, but the application of that right to our nation's youngest, ones who are truly disenfranchised-- not having the right to vote or...
something on your mind, Mr. Stone?
I was just wondering if it was possible that you were A...
fanboy of a certain celebrity client.
Mr. Stone, did you just characterize me, jordan wethersby ii, senior partner of one of this country's most prestigious firms, a "fanboy"?
of course not, sir, but
I didn't think so.
and for the record, my musical tastes are none of your concern.
in the name of all that's good and holy, what now?
I hate that song.
I would never sing it under any circumstances, even hallucinatory ones.
just like you would never go out with one of our co-workers.
Eli, is there something you want to ask me?
no,'cause I don't listen to my visions anymore, so...
well, considering last week, A.K.A.Bribing a judge, it's probably for the best.
well, without admitting or denying anything, there won't be any more of that stuff, ause I'm-- I'm having it taken out...
the aneurysm.
I thought it was too dangerous. - Nah.
the ability to swallow's overrated.
just tell me. Is there something going on with you and Matt?
no.
you know, if you hadn't dumped me-- repeatedly, I might add
I would say you were jealous.
I'm not jealous. I'm not.
it's just been a rough week, okay?
you wouldn't happen to have any time later, would you?
I'll tell you all about it.
look, I get the feeling you're alone right now.
so am I.
but I'm trying to move on.
so I can't be that shoulder for you to cry on.
I'm sorry. I just--I can't.
that's okay.
Hey, Beth? It's Eli.
Yeah, well, I was thinking about what you said the other day about, uh, needing to talk to someone, and, uh, I kinda do.
principal ackerman, you said that molly was expelled because her actions were a violation of school policy, correct?
students have to learn about consequences.
that's why the school has a strict zero tolerance policy in those circumstances.
zero tolerance?
so you expel every kid who pulls a prank?
if those pranks are disruptive.
so last fall, when the football team kidnapped the mascot from a rival high school, did you expel the whole team?
I didn't deem that prank disruptive to the other students' educations.
what about when members of the senior class superglued the teacher's lounge door shut?
those students were suspended.
but not expelled?
it sounds like your zero tolerance policy is more like A...
six tolerance policy.
objection. - Pass the witness.
principal ackerman, why does your school have an abstinence-only program?
because it's the only sex education that the federal government will give us money for.
and if word got out that a student played a sexually explicit song during one of your assemblies
I'd lose the funding, and the school would have no sex ed program.
is that right?
I don't know.
what I do know is that a girl playing a song that promotes promiscuous sex during a lecture on abstinence risks the program for everyone.
your honor, the plaintiff would like to call a rebuttal witness
it's the legal name of the artist who wrote the offending song, your honor.
Mr. George Michael. - Fine.
court will recess until tomorrow.
you're a judge.
the case comes before you.
do you order one human being to undergo a painful medical procedure to benefit another?
bottom line
if I were a jurist on this, I could find precedent to support saving my life.
my son can be as angry as he wants at me, but the last time I checked, being a lousy dad didn't carry the death penalty.
you know, I had a dad.
he left my mother when I was... 6...
for her best friend.
I saw him summers and every other christmas.
I'm sorry.
at what point did Mr. Dowd become a witness?
at the point when you let me finish.
my dad died three years ago.
and if I had a chance to save his life,
I think the first thing I'd want to know is why I should.
because regret's a lousy thing to live with.
well, that's sweet.
they should put that in a poem or something.
we're all here wonderi why scott should feel any regret at all.
you are as much a stranger to him as my father was to me.
more so.
we're family, however estranged we may be.
nothing changes that.
no, you changed it.
you walked out that door two decades ago, and you never look back.
and so I should die for that?
Scott di give you cancer, judge.
you want him to save you? - Yes.
tell us. Tell us why he should.
because he's my son.
he has an obligation- - no, he doesn't.
you pissed away any obligation he had to you.
now tell us why he should help you now.
because I want to live!
I want to live.
the only chance I have of that is him.
Taylor. We met at
Oh, your engagement party, of course.
it's so nice to see you.
what are you doing here?
is-- is everything okay? Your son?
Oh, he's great, thanks.
no, I'm, um, I'm not here on business. I'm having dinner.
with eli? - Yeah.
that's great.
old friends catching up.
have fun. - Thanks.
what are you doing?
cause I desperately, desperately need a margarita.
and you want me to come with you?
right! Great. Well, let me just...
or not.
no, she didn't. - Yes, she did.
Melanie bose totally had the hots for you.
so that's why you were talking to me at that party?
you were playing wingwoman for the girl with the headgear?
when she found out that we slept togeer, she never talked to me again.
that's because you were a college whore. - I know.
what?
I just think--and this is a good week, you know?
george michael's here, my case is interesting, and...
and I haven't laughed like this in a long time.
thanks for going out with me tonight.
it's my pleasure.
you know, all that's going on with you, I'm really glad that I can be here.
you don't know how nice it is to hear that.
lately I've been less popular than...Melanie Bose.
well, you're just going through a rough time.
but think of all the people that you've helped-- okay, me and ben for two.
winning that beutel trial totally changed our lives.
I mean, you have to know that.
I do know that.
I just--it just doesn't change the fact that...I'm alone.
I'm so sorry, eli.
God.
I just broke the rule number one, you know?
you don't tell a girl you're on a date with that you're lonely.
Oh, god - what?
are you okay? - Uh, yeah.
no.
Nate told me, um, he said that he was gonna tell you today.
tell me what?
about you guys dating? - Yeah.
Oh, no. Of course he told me that.
thank god! oh, my god.
for a second there I thought maybe you didn't know.
Oh, no. Well, that would be awkward.
to losers.
national order of total losers, san francisco chapter, in session.
What--don't look at me like that.
you didn't have any plans tonight either, loser.
believe me, I could have had plans-- plenty of plans with plenty of ladies.
all right, fine. I'm the only loser, then. To me.
no, you're not a loser, taylor.
you're smart. You're hot.
you're funny... you're hot...
and an excellent drinker.
he's getting it out.
who's getting what out?
Eli. Aneurysm.
out. Bye-bye, aneurysm.
turns out that's not why he dumped me anyway.
what are you talkin' about?
I thought he wanted to protect me.
I thought he didn't want me to see him suffer.
turns out the aneurysm was just an excuse.
Eli dumped me because he just didn't love me enough.
well, I don't know much about aneurysms, but something's gotta be wrong if he dumped you.
that's sweet.
what you said in court today about your dad
now I know why you have to be so damn cocky all the time, why you only date these vapid bimbos.
you're scared that you're gonna be abandoned by someone you actually care about.
sometimes it's just so hard...to be the real me.
she told you.
have you any idea how humiliating that was for me?
this isn't how I wanted you find out. - That finally after months of misery and loneliness and--and visions,
I finally ask someone out, and I think we're making a connection, only to find out she's already dating my brother.
I-I was gonna tell you yesterday.
Yeah, I could tell from the way you didn't.
we had just come from the doctor.
you have all of these huge, life-altering decisions on your plate.
I didn't want to make things worse.
by telling me you were happy?
I was trying to protect you.
well, I'm a big boy, Nate.
you datingeth wouldn't have even registered if you'd have told me before I'd made an ass out of myself!
okay. All right.
so you would have said, "hey, that is great."
you know, my life is tanking worse than the latest Ben Stiller movie, but I'm so glad you're happy.
maybe I would have, yeah. Who knows?
I've been an--an idiot lately. I pushed taylor away.
I pushed Maggie away, Tti, Chen.
I just--I just thought that no matter how much of an idiot I was,
I wouldn't push my own brother away.
you haven't pushed me away.
you've been dating the girl I lost my virginity to for two months, and you haven't mentioned it.
I said I was sorry.
you call the doctors.
you make all the appointments.
but you don't want to go anywhere near this decision, 'cause you're afraid of how you're gonna feel if it doesn't work
if I end up paralyzed or worse.
you're a doctor, but you're my big brother, man.
and I need you now more than ever.
but if this is your idea of helping me, thanks but no, thanks.
Eli, wait.
just wait! - god!
come on, kitty, move. You're on my jacket!
give him a pet.
Sonny bono loves to be touched.
your cat's name is Sonny Bono?
that's so weird.
it was between that and "Jason Bourne."
you're trying to sneak out of here, aren't you?
I'm not sure I've ever been snuck out on before.
no, wait, I have.
I'm not sneaking out.
I'm just leaving quietly.
I've got court.
I know... with me.
please be seated.
it is profoundly disturbing to me that one human being could willfully deny another their last hope for life.
but that doesn't change the very real fact that there is no legal precedent to support judge doyle's claim.
the plaintiff's suit for breach of contract and specific remedy of performance is hereby denied and judgment granted to the defendant.
Scott, I know I don't deserve what I'm asking for.
but please don't do anything that you...
Mr. Michael, tell me, what inspired your song,"I want your sex"?
a song, by the way, which rose to number one on the world charts
a song that helped you win a grammy for best album of the year.
well, it was inspired by a relationship.
like most of my work, it was autobiographical.
you heard principal Ackerman describe the song as encouraging promiscuity.
but it's just the opposite.
ironically enough, I wrote the song about abstinence, and I was very much in love with someone at the time.
so how do you feel about your song being used to protest an abstinence-only sex education program?
well, I applaud it, obviously.
when I wrote it, we were in year six of the A. I.D. S.Crisis, a crisis that ronald Reagan did not even address publicly until there were over 21, 000 people dead.
and what the government is doing right now
funding federal programs that tell children that condoms don't work is killing people all over again.
thank you, mr. Michael.
these are the lyrics to "I want your sex."
would you please read the highlighted portion?
sex is natural. Sex is good.
not everybody does it, but everybody should.
do you not think?
do you deny that these lyrics could be understood to promote sexual activity?
no, to deny that would be ridiculous.
nothing further, your honor.
but would ms. Abrams' interpretation of the lyrics be appropriate in the context of an abstinence-only sex education program?
well, I don't think I can answer that, because an abstinence-only "sex education program" is an oxymoron.
abstinence can only be a choice if you have all the facts.
I love this country.
I love the fact that you guys have a constitution, that you practice separation of church and state.
but I don't think I'm alone in wondering what's going on with all that right now, and, um, in my opinion, right now America could use a lot more people like Molly.
the whole world could.
judge tate's decision is imminent.
my recommendation would be to settle this now.
get out while you can.
we don't want out.
judge tate is not going to insert herself into what is clearly a school matter.
consider mr. Michael's testimony.
judge Tate certainly will.
not to mention, all the negative media attention has to be getting to you.
just wait until george does his press conference.
that's a good point, sir.
you know what? This isn't worth it.
enough is enough.
we'll reinstate molly, all right?
No!
I did this to make a point.
I want the school to have a real sex education program.
we've been through this. There's no way.
I'm sorry, molly, but the school can't have a sex ed program that doesn't receive federal funding.
well, actually, I think I know how we can raise that kind of money in one night.
a hero arises.
Lly, how fast can you get a message out?
six seconds.
there are other avenues we can pursue
other angles, more money.
everyone has a price.
we could appeal to his mother.
she may see things our way.
no, I...
I think we all know I'm getting exactly what I deserve.
judge...
use what time you have left.
reach out. Make contact with your son.
no, I'm...
I'm done using other people for my benefit.
then do it for his.
his testimony was proof.
he needs to let go of some of that anger.
otherwise, he'll end up...
just like "the boil"?
you make a persuasive argument, Taylor.
and thank you both for everything.
nice picture, Mr. Dowd.
when was this picture taken?
uh, this summer.
and this man with the familial resemblance would be your... uncle?
your much older brother?
because I know there's no way it's your deceased father.
I noted to think that you were actually a human being, but you are a pig.
okay, I lied.
in court!
Oh, come on. I wasn't under oath.
I was trying to win a case.
anyway, how relevant is it whether or not my father's alive?
it's extremely relevant, because that is why I slept with you!
Oh, come on.
you didn't have such a bad time last night.
the quality of the time is irrelevant, because last night was a drunken, stupid mistake.
any chance we can make the same drunken mistake again tonight?
not even the slightest. - Okay.
if you change your mind-- - I won't.
interesting.
your new "office."
well, square footage-wise, it's an improvement.
erything ready for tonight-- insurance, security, lighting rentals?
Yeah, one of the perks of having a client roster as big as the phone book.
can I help you with something, sir?
I came by to...
apologies are difficult for a man like me.
but gratitude- - you helped me, sir.
what I mean is...
it's been some time since a case has made me, well, feel something.
I can see why you've been finding your new calling so fulfling.
plus you got to meet George Michael.
you don't think he noticed, do you?
it was barely obvious, sir.
I discovered his music back in the early years of this firm.
I was stuck on this hellacious document production
just me and a roomful of files working past midnight for three weeks.
I'd stay so late, it was just me and the cleaning crew.
and... one of them had a boom box, and all he played was...
most nights, that was music was the only thing that kept me going.
I still associate it with my better days.
I doubt those days really were better.
they were.
and now as I enter the waning side of my life...
losing everything is like the sun going down on me. Sorry.
thank you, eli.
this has been the best week I've had in a lo time.
you l right?
I may be getting there.
look, I should havetold you about Beth.
and, um, I should've- - Nate, shut up.
you didn't do anything...
except the girl I lost my virginity to.
Yeah.
is it gonna be weird between us? - No.
I'm used to weird by now.
and you're my brother, and even when I want to poke out your eyeballs...
I still love you.
so...
I've been thinkin'...
Japaksa. He's our guy.
sure about that?
if you are.
you're the doctor, and I trust you.
then he's the one we're picking.
and I'm sticking around to make sure he's the right choice.
are you, uh, sure you want to do this?
I have never been more sure of anything in my life.
is he gonna be okay?
Jordan? He's gonna be st fine.
well, you did a good thing this week, eli.
you're the one doing the good thing, George.
a high school football stadium's kind of a step down from the staples center, but it means the world to these kids.
well, you know, these days you just have to do - what you can to try and make a difference, don't you? - Yeah.
can I give you a bit of advice?
if anyone could.
I know I've had my share of hits, but I've taken a few hits, too.
and, uh, if there's anything I've learned, it's that no matter what, you just have to keep going.
do you know what I mean?
I think I do. - Good.
well, that's settled, then.
ladies and gentlemen
Mr. George Michael!
he said you almost got into a car when you were kids?
shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle were playing in front of my house.
this car came up and took Dave away.
abduction? -Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.
convinced Dave to get in the car, kept him for four days before he escaped.
they catch these guys? -One died.
the other got busted, went the noose route in his cell.
your pal Markum, the moment I laid eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.
they never lose that tension, it settles in their shoulders.
he lost his daughter. That's what's in his shoulders.
no, that's in his stomach. The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.
cause of death: the gunshot wound to the head, not the trauma from the beating.
what else? -Her and her friends were barhopping.
we're interviewing anyone who might have seen them.
one other thing, the backpack in her car...
...had pamphlets on Las Vegas and a list of Vegas hotels.
it doesn't sound like much.
what do you say, Devine?
we'll get the guy, sir.
that's right. All right, let's do it.
that's the best you can come up with? -lt made him happy, didn't it?
this is Sean.
Hello? -ls it Lauren?
you're in Manhattan. I can tell by the traffic sounds.
is he with you?
is that the baby?
Lauren, at least tell me her name.
Yeah, nice talking to you too.
Hey.
would it surprise you?
wouldn't be the first time.
did you see that girl? Did you see that--?
did you see her?
I heard a car hit something. -Hit what? Another car?
Oh, no, not loud like that. -Like hitting the curb?
Yes, maybe.
then it stalled, and someone said, "Hi."
someone said, "Hi"? -"Hi."
then there was a loud crack.
could it have been a gunshot? -Yes, maybe.
did you look out your window, Mrs. Prior? -Oh, no.
I was in my dressing gown by then.
I don't look out the window in my dressing gown.
the voice you heard, was that a male or a female?
female.
I think.
lt sounds like the girl knew the shooter. -Yeah.
sorry to trouble you.
Jimmy. -Theo.
how's my daughter? How's Annabeth holding up?
she's trying. -Let's get these on ice.
you got a couple of coolers?
right here's fine.
so how are you handling all this so far?
lt hasn't really sunk in, Theo. -Yeah?
it's gonna hurt like hell when it does.
when my Janey died, I was no good for six months...
...but my kids were all grown up. I had that luxury.
you, you got domestic responsibilities.
domestic responsibilities?
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter and those girls. That's your first priority.
Oh, you figured that might have slipped my mind?
it just needed to be said, that's all.
you'll come through because you're a man.
like I said to Annabeth, your wedding day.
I said, "You got yourself a real old-school man there."
like they put her in a bag. -What?
that's what Katie looked like when I saw her in the morgue.
like they put her in a bag and then they beat the bag with pipes.
well-- -Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.
she went to sleep, she never woke up. Peaceful.
you don't need to talk about Janey. -My daughter was murdered.
they put a gun to her. As we stand here, she's on an autopsy slab...
...getting cut open by scalpels and chest spreaders...
...and you're talking to me about domestic fucking responsibility?
good to see you, Theo.
Eve, just tell them what they want to know.
who was she dating? -We already told the Savages.
the Savage brothers? -They were here yesterday.
good, now try us out. Who was she dating?
no one special.
you guys were having a goodbye dinner, right?
what? -She was leaving town, wasn't she?
going to Las Vegas? -How do you know?
she closed her bank account, she had hotel phone numbers.
she wanted out of this dump. She wanted to start a new life.
well, a 19-year-old girl doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.
so who was she going with?
come on, girls. Who was she going with?
Brendan.
excuse me?
Brendan. -Brendan Harris?
Brendan Harris, yeah.
you got an address?
Hey, Dave.
Hey, Jimmy.
sorry, I came out for a smoke.
go ahead, sit down. Sit down.
I haven't had a chance to talk to you all day.
how you doing?
how you doing?
what happened to your hand?
this?
I was helping a buddy move a couch. I slammed it in the doorjamb.
ways you can manage to hurt yourself, right?
it's good to see you.
yeah?
how are our girls holding up?
they're doing okay, I guess.
that Celeste, she's a godsend. You thank her for me, will you?
it's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.
Yeah.
I couldn't stand looking through the fridge to find room for all that food...
...we're gonna throw away in the next few days.
lot of waste, huh? -Yeah.
I just can't let anything get fucked up in these next few days.
because it's all anybody will remember about her.
one thing you could say about Katie, even when she was little...
...that girl was neat.
when I got out of the joint...
...you know, after Marita died...
...I remember, I was more afraid of my little daughter...
...than I ever was of being in prison.
I loved her...
...most because when we were sitting in that kitchen that night...
...it was like we were the last two people on Earth. You know, forgotten.
unwanted.
and it's really starting to piss me off, Dave, because I can't cry for her.
my own little daughter, and I can't even cry for her.
Jimmy.
you're crying now.
Yeah, damn.
I just want to hug her one more time.
she was 19 fucking years old.
do you want me to leave you alone?
no, just stay here for a minute, if that's cool.
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.
when was the last time you saw Katie Markum?
you don't think I'd hurt her do you? -She isn't hurt. She's dead.
I didn't kill her. -Again, when's the last time you saw her?
about 8-- Saturday night, about 8: 00.
about like 8, Brendan, or at 8?
it was about 8.
we had a couple slices at Hi-Fi, and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum like you?
I don't know.
but he told Katie he never wanted her to see me or any other Harris.
what? That thief thinks he's better than our family?
he's not a thief. -He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.
daughter probably had the same bad gene. You count yourself lucky, Bren.
so Katie had some brochures for Vegas. We heard she was going there with you.
we were gonna leave Sunday.
we were gonna get married when we got there.
well, that was the plan, right?
you were gonna leave me? Without a word?
ma, I was gonna tell you. -Just like your father, huh?
that's my brother, Ray, and his friend John.
Hey, boys. -Hey.
he don't speak.
father couldn't shut up, but his son's a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.
they're here about Katie. Why don't you go watch TV or something.
so where were you between 1 2: 30 and 2 a. m. on Sunday morning, Brendan?
I was asleep.
can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?
I can confirm that he closed his door at 10: 00.
he came down for breakfast at 9.
I can't confirm that he didn't open his window and go down the fire escape.
okay, we're gonna ask you to take a polygraph. You think you'd be up for that?
I loved her so much.
I'm never gonna feel that again.
it doesn't happen twice.
doesn't happen once most times.
Celeste.
sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me. -What are you still doing here?
I don't know.
I don't know, I just...
did Annabeth get to sleep?
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.
could I get one of those? -Yeah.
one for the road and then home.
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want. Sit up with Annabeth.
you've done enough.
to you and Dave for being here for this.
okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.
I'll be by first thing tomorrow. See you first thing.
good night.
good night. -Yeah, good night.
Hello?
Christ. Lauren, say something.
okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?
Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing things made sense.
I'm tired of caring about some dead girl, and there's just gonna be another one after her.
sending killers to jail is sending them where they've been heading all their lives.
the dead are still dead.
Jesus, l can't do this tonight.
I just...
I can't do it.
Bye, baby.
because sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.
he was the boy.
the boy who escaped from wolves.
an animal of the dusk.
invisible.
silent.
living in a world the others never saw.
world of fireflies.
unseen except as a flare in the corner of your eye.
vanished by the time you turn your head toward it.
I just gotta get my head right.
catch a nice, long sleep.
and the boy will go back to his forest.
back to his fireflies.
is he asleep?
how's Jimmy and everybody?
okay.
it's weird.
took something like this for me and him to become friends again.
Dave? Dave.
there's still nothing in the paper.
about what?
about what?
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't hurt him as bad as I thought.
he's a mugger. He's not going to the hospital.
Yeah.
right.
anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.
that seems more important right now.
I know in my soul I contributed to your death.
but I don't know how.
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.
good. I didn't like him for it, nor want him for it.
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.
ballistics will be back in a while. Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.
all people who, I'm certain, are dying to cooperate.
considering the crime, maybe.
Dave Boyle?
Hey, is that the guy you were friends with as a kid? The car guy?
could be.
he's a guy to talk to. He knows you. He won't treat us like cops.
clam up for no reason, huh? -We'll see.
Hey, Boyle!
what's it been, seven, eight years? -Yeah.
Yeah. How you doing?
this is my son, Michael.
Hey, Michael. How you doing? My name's Sean.
I'm an old buddy of your dad's. Hi.
so you still with the staties? -Homicide. This is my partner.
sergeant Powers. How are you? -So you got a minute?
we'd love to ask some quick questions. -I was just gonna walk Michael to school.
I can be back in a few minutes. -Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?
sure.
so you look good.
I hear rents are rising. -Yeah, the yuppies are coming.
they're cutting my dad's old house up into condos.
we walked by there the other day.
must be something we could do to stop them.
a friend of mine says the other day, he says:
neighborhood needs a fucking crime wave. Get property values where they belong.
young girls keep getting murdered up in Pen Park, Mr. Boyle, you might get your wish.
Dave. Call me Dave.
you said the F-word, Dad.
Yeah, I know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.
us guys need to talk. Go on.
so, what's up, Sean? -Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday. Celeste is there now.
who's Celeste? -My wife.
how's Jimmy doing? - It's hard to tell. You know him.
Yeah, so the reason we came by-- -Listen, I saw her.
Katie. I don't know if you know that. At McGill's, the night she died.
that's what we wanted to talk about.
they were at a couple of bars that night. Your name turned up for McGill's.
they put on quite a show dancing on the bar.
pretty drunk, huh? -But it was harmless.
they weren't stripping or nothing. They were just 19.
what time did they leave?
I left at 1. They must've left 15 minutes before me.
so we'll say 12:45? -Sounds about right.
you see anything unusual or anyone--?
Michael.
like what? -I don't know.
a guy watching the girls?
a guy with hate in his eyes? A woman-hater?
no. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar, it would've been business as usual.
see you later, Dad. -You got your milk money?
fuck, I hated school.
what?
Yeah, me too, Sean.
just one more thing, Mr. Boyle. Where did you go after you left McGill's?
home. -Home by 1:15, would you say?
roughly. Sure. - All right.
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave. We'll grab a beer sometime?
Yeah, I'd like that, Sean. -All right.
what?
what happened to him in that car?
can you believe this?
man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts. It costs 15 times the price.
you know, you take away love, money or hate as motives...
...you're not left with a whole lot.
well, if this Markum thing's random, I mean, shit.
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady, Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.
hears a gunshot, before that a "hi..."
...which tells me the girl is either friendly or she knew him.
she turns into the curb, not too fast or she hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.
she says, "Hi." He shoots her. -She slams the door into him, takes off.
what makes her swerve without hitting the brakes?
I don't know. Something in the street. -Maybe.
this Markum girl couldn't have weighed more than what, 110?
she hit hard enough to get a jump on him? -Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.
your pal Dave strikes me as a guy permanently back on his heels.
wait a second, how did we get to Dave Boyle all of a sudden?
we just got to him. -He's a guy who was in the bar.
the last place, Seany, the last place she was at.
the guy is wrong. You saw his hand.
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously want to take a look at Dave Boyle?
just a little one.
I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours, from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.
sure. -Good.
have you thought about flowers? -I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.
good.
and the notice?
notice?
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it if you give us her basic information.
or if you prefer donations in lieu of flowers?
Where's my daughter?
downstairs, in the basement.
I wanna see her.
I'm gonna find him, Katie.
I'm gonna find him before the police do.
I'm gonna find the man, and I'm gonna kill him.
did you say something, Mr. Markum?
the notice.
it should read: "Katherine Markum...
...beloved daughter of James and Marita, deceased...
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to
sister to Sara and Nadine."
you guys again? -Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.
you dropping in on Jimmy? -Yeah.
do you have some kind of, what, break in the case?
no, just paying our respects. Where you off to?
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes. I'm gonna go get some. See you in a minute.
by the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened to your hand there?
garbage disposal. It jammed, I stuck my hand in, it started again.
stupid. -Painful.
garbage disposal. Bullshit.
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean he killed anybody either. Come on.
heard you could use one. -Thanks.
I quit 10 years ago, you believe this? -Whatever you need right now.
come on in, I'll get Jimmy.
I got a couple errands I gotta run. I'll be back in an hour.
you don't have to come back, Celeste. I'll be fine.
sure? -Celeste Boyle?
Yeah.
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's. This is Whitey Powers.
Mrs. Boyle. -Nice to meet you.
look, I gotta go.
Oh, damn it. I left my report pad in the cruiser.
you better go get it. -Yeah.
come on.
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you a quick question?
me? -What time did Dave get home on Saturday?
what? -It's a little thing.
we're running a time line on everything involving Katie. I'm sure...
...Dave told you he saw her at McGill's.
you think Dave killed Katie?
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that. Why would I even think that?
I don't know. -No, no. It's just that we could figure out...
...what time she was on the road if we knew what time Dave got home.
see, it's 5 minutes from your place to McGill's...
...and Katie left 15 minutes before Dave did. You see what I mean.
I was asleep.
Saturday night, when Dave came in, I was asleep.
okay. Well, thanks.
bullshit.
no, he was dating Katie, Jim.
they were gonna elope to Vegas. We found tickets under their names.
Brendan Harris confirmed it.
remember what you said?
how she looked at you on Saturday like she was preparing to never see you again?
did Brendan Harris kill my daughter? -No.
you're 100 percent sure?
passed his poly with flying colors, plus it seemed to me like he really loved her.
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.
why are you so dead set against that kid?
he said Katie told him you'd disowned her if she ever dated a Harris.
I knew his father. They called him "Just Ray" Harris.
why is that?
there were so many Rays in the neighborhood.
you had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck, " Psycho Ray" Dorian.
the cool names were taken, so he got stuck with "Just Ray.
we never got along. I flat out didn't like him.
and he cut out on his wife when she was pregnant with that little mute of hers.
I don't know.
I just figure the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris dating Katie or any other daughter of mine.
I can't believe we're talking about Just Ray Harris.
how about this? We've interviewed witnesses...
...canvassed people who were in the bar.
we've run into more than a few of them who were questioned...
...before us by one or more of the Savage brothers.
so? -So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.
some people don't talk to policemen, Sean. -With all due respect...
...and just so we're clear, this is our case.
how long? -How long what?
how long before you catch my daughter's killer?
you bargaining with us?
bargaining?
you giving us a deadline?
we'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum. If that's okay with you.
just find my daughter's killer, sergeant. I'm not standing in your way.
the last thing we need is Markum and the Savages putting the fear of God...
...into the neighborhood. -We grew up terrified of them.
eleven months apart, like their mother ran a loose-cannon factory.
fucking knuckleheads.
ballistics are in on the Markum murder.
Yeah, you got a match? -You're gonna love it.
it's a perfect match. Gun was a. 38 Smith.
part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer in New Hampshire in 1982.
the same gun that killed Katherine Markum was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1 984.
ln Buckingham. -The Flats?
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors. I pulled the file.
it was a two-man job. They fired a warning shot into a wall.
that's where the bullet got pulled. -Nice work.
thought you'd like that.
it's okay, Ray.
don't worry about it.
ma said that?
that I'm better off?
I loved her! You know what that's like?
huh?
I'm sorry.
no, you're wrong.
I won't ever feel that again.
right there. Went in through a bottle of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.
scary, huh? -Scarier than a glass of milk, right?
so take me through it. These two guys come in...
in rubber masks. They came in through here.
that's the storeroom.
there's a door back there that leads to a loading dock.
I always keep that door locked.
so they must have had a key.
a key? So, what you're saying is that it was an inside job?
it had to be. One of them, at least, worked for me at some point.
the only reason they fired that goddamn warning shot was they must have known...
...I kept this under the counter.
and you told the police that at the time. -Yeah.
sure, they went through my employment records.
questioned everybody who used to work for me.
never made an arrest. -Still have a copy of those records?
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there. But I know who did it.
Oh, yeah?
this guy I fired a couple of weeks before.
son of a bitch came in here a few days after the robbery.
he had this fucking goddamn grin on his face.
and I just knew.
go tell a grin to a jury, right?
you remember his name?
do I look senile to you?
no, sir. -Name...
...was Ray Harris.
we used to call him "Just Ray."
you say they used the same gun for another crime?
that's correct, sir. -Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.
where you been?
out.
what you watching?
some vampire movie.
guy just got his head torn off.
Where'd you go, Celeste?
I was sitting in my car...
...down by the channel. You know...
...thinking about things.
What'd you think about? -Oh, you know...
no, actually, I don't know.
things. You know, the day.
about Katie being dead.
and poor Annabeth and Jimmy, you know...
...those things.
those things.
know what I was thinking about, huh?
vampires.
what about them?
they're undead...
...but I think maybe there's something beautiful about it.
maybe one day you wake up and you forget what it's like...
...to be human. Maybe then it's okay.
what the fuck you talking about, Dave?
vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.
you're not making any sense.
you think I killed Katie?
Celeste. -What -?
ls that the sense we're making these days? -Where'd you come up with that?
you've barely looked at me since you found out Katie was dead.
in fact, you seem repulsed by me.
Dave! -What?
I don't think anything. I'm confused, okay?
even your friend Sean asked about
he's not my friend, if you didn't know.
he asked me about you. What time you came home.
What'd you tell him? -I said I was asleep.
that's good thinking, baby. -Jesus Christ, Dave!
why don't you tell them about the mugger? -The mugger?
the mugger! I see how your mind's working. I do.
I come home with blood on me the same night Katie's murdered.
I must have killed her, right?
fuck!
Henry...
what? Henry?
Henry and George.
I never told anyone that before.
those were their names.
isn't that fucking hilarious?
at least that's what they called themselves, but...
...they were wolves, and Dave...
...was the boy who escaped from wolves.
what are you talking about, Dave?
I'm talking Henry and George.
they took me on a four-day ride.
they buried me in this ratty old cellar with a sleeping bag.
and, man, Celeste...
...did they have their fun.
and no one came to help old Dave then.
Dave had to pretend to be somebody else.
you mean, all those years ago...
...when you were a little boy?
Dave...
Dave's dead.
I don't know who came out of that cellar, but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!
you see, honey
fuck!
it's like vampires.
once it's in you...
...it stays.
what stays?
did you know there were child prostitutes in Rome Basin?
what?
fuck!
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.
I'm warning you...
...I can't trust my mind.
I gotta go out, try to get my head around it.
okay.
okay.
okay.
the gun sends us in a different direction. -I don't see it that way.
what does Just Ray's gun have to do with Dave?
these things get passed around.
just Ray may have blown town, but his gun never did.
I say we talk with Brendan Harris in the morning.
and I say Dave Boyle. The hand story. The wife, she's definitely scared.
they're hiding something, but Dave Boyle's as much a killer as Brendan Harris.
boyle fits the profile, a fucking T. Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...
...sexually abused as a kid. On paper, this guy should be in jail already.
Katie Markum was not sexually abused, see?
in that equation, sexual emission is part of the deal.
you were friends when you were kids. This makes you a fucking liability.
he's not my friend.
turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs off my hip faster than yours.
Hey, Jimmy.
you're out late.
Yeah, you too.
it's cold, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
you know, l...
I been sitting out here...over the last few years...
...waiting on Katie to get back from someplace.
about midnight, I'd say to Annabeth, "I'm gonna go sit on the porch for a while."
weird thing is...
...it seemed to bring her back.
I saw her, you know.
saw who?
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.
you saw Katie Saturday night? -Never got around to telling you.
did you talk to her?
just nodded hello at one point.
next time I looked up, she was gone.
but...
...Jimmy...
...she looked...
...happy.
I got more walking to do. Good night.
you stole his car. - His car was officially towed.
from the front of his house. -No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...
...adjacent to the parkway.
lucky for us, the parkway's state jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...
...they took it for a joy ride... -What? Why'd you do it?
after I left you last night, I decided to talk to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.
I get to his house, I decide to look in his car, see what he's got. I find blood.
blood? -Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.
how much? -A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot more.
type O, same type as Katie Markum.
wait, Katie Markum never got in anybody's trunk.
she was chased through the park where she died.
it's enough to ask questions. -Your search is gonna get tossed out.
no, found and abandoned in state jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.
ln the best interest of the owner. -Get a physical search, file the report.
bingo.
you wanna talk to him, or should I send him home?
Dave's here? - I've had him in the box for an hour.
sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers to pick him up.
come on, Mr. Boyle!
we know you didn't get that swollen hand sticking it in the garbage disposal.
Oh, yeah? How do you know that? - Why's your wife afraid of you?
she know what really happened to your hand?
how about a Sprite or something?
how about you tell us what really happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?
you lied.
that's your opinion, which you're entitled to.
Hey, you think this is funny? -No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.
not only was my car stolen last night, but now you won't release it to me.
okay.
all right.
tell us, Mr. Boyle, how did you get the blood in your car?
what blood? -Let's start with the front seat.
what are you looking at him for?
Hey, you think I could get that Sprite, Sean?
sure.
Oh, I get it.
you're the good cop.
how about a meatball sub while you're at it?
I ain't your bitch, Dave. Looks like you'll have to wait.
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch, aren't you, Sean?
the blood on your front seat, Dave. Answer the sergeant.
we got a chainlink fence in our back yard.
me and my kid play Wiffle Ball every afternoon after school.
he's getting good, so most of the balls are on the other side of the fence.
so I climb it. Except I slip...
...slice myself where the links curl in, right here.
bled like hell.
ten minutes later, I gotta pick up Michael at school.
probably was still bleeding when I got in the front seat.
what blood type are you?
B-negative.
yeah? That's the match we got.
well, there you go. - Not quite.
blood in the trunk of the car wasn't B-negative.
I don't know anything about any blood in the trunk.
no idea how half a pint of blood got in the trunk?
none. -This is not the way you wanna go, Dave.
how will that look in court?
you not knowing how someone else's blood got in the trunk of your car?
gonna look fine, I suppose. You filed the report.
what report?
the stolen-car report. The car wasn't in my possession last night.
so whatever the thieves used it for, you should find out...
...because it sounds like they were up to no good.
things looking any better on the Sprite, Sean?
well, you just got too fucking smart. The car is inadmissible.
anything there, his lawyers say was put by thieves.
I can break him. -He just kicked our asses!
you still think Dave wouldn't hurt a fly
ls that the point? No. -What is the point?
we can break this open on the gun. It's the gun.
okay. Maybe.
so, what do we do with Dave?
fuck it. Kick him loose.
maybe a Celtic cross. That's always a popular choice.
or this lovely red marble here.
or a figural.
that one.
very good. Nice and simple.
Hey, Jimmy!
Annabeth said you were here.
we been asking around, like you said to.
yeah? -Yeah.
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit you did for me.
and it ain't about me missing your brains running things.
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but she was part of our family, we loved her.
I don't question you, Val. What's up?
cops are all over this. Doing their job for once. Bars, street trade, everything.
every hooker we talked to, bartender, already been questioned.
the fucking law has descended, Jimmy. - What about Just Ray's kid?
quiet as a mouse. Kid's no trouble to anyone.
I talked to Diane and Eve. They said he loved her.
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.
want us to take a run at him? - No.
hold off for now. Anything else?
they'd better not push me on him, or I'll just kick them in the teeth on it.
well, I think, if they...
internal Revenue people that are kicking...
Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.
he is to be out.
I don't give a goddamn what the story is.
he went on television.
I have not. I've already ordered Connally, we're going after the chandlers, every one individually, collectively, their income taxes are starting this week.
every one of those sons of bitches.
well, this is something that we can really hang Teddy or...
Yeah.
or the Kennedy clan with.
I'm gonna want to put that in Colson's hands.
and we're gonna want to run with it.
a controversial day in politics.
a man arrested trying to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee in Washington turns out to be an employee of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
he is one of five persons surprised and arrested yesterday inside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington.
and guess what else he is.
a consultant of President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign committee.
the trial started today at the federal courthouse for the five burglars caught breaking into the Democratic National Party headquarters.
stand by for camera.
John Dean, the ex-White House Counsel, testified today that President Nixon knew about the Watergate cover-up.
at one point in the conversation,
I recall the President telling me to keep a good list of the press people giving us trouble because we will make life difficult for them after the election.
Dean read through a 245-page statement characterizing a president who was easily outraged over war protesters and political adversaries, and outlining a range of offenses, including wiretapping of newsmen, a Charles Colson plan to firebomb and burglarize the Brookings Institution, and spying on Senator Kennedy and other Democrats.
the misuse of power is the very essence of tyranny.
and consider, if you will, the frightening implications of that for a free society.
the President today accepted the resignation of three of his closest aides.
out is H. R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.
also quitting under fire is John Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.
good morning. The Supreme Court has just ruled on the tapes controversy, and here is Carl Stern, who has that ruling.
it is a unanimous decision, Doug, eight to zero.
justice Rehnquist took no part in the decision ordering the President of the United States to turn over the tapes.
it's an eight-to-zero unanimous opinion.
a White House aide told NBC News today that impeachment of the President by the full House of Representatives now is a virtual certainty.
these are, with no serious doubt, the last hours of the 37th presidency of the United States.
this is indeed an historic day, the only time a president has ever resigned from office in our nearly 200 years of history.
you see the White House there, and in the White House, in just a few moments now,
president Nixon will be appearing before the people, perhaps for the last time as President of the United States.
15 seconds, Mr. President.
okay, that's five, four, three...
good evening. This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that have shaped the history of our nation.
I remember exactly where I was.
my father called. The phone rang, my father called and he said, "Turn on the TV right now. Richard Nixon's going down."
I was at home with friends, and we were watching television at home.
we stayed up and, like everyone else, I'd been glued to the Select and Judiciary Committee hearings night after night.
and then finally, it had come to this.
therefore, I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
but instead of the satisfaction I imagined I'd feel,
I just got angrier and angrier, because there was no admission of guilt.
there was no apology.
little did I know that I would one day be part of the team that would try and elicit that apology.
to leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body.
I have never been a quitter.
and that that team would be led by the most unlikely of white knights, a man with no political convictions whatsoever, a man who, as far as I know, had never even voted once in his life.
but he was a man who had one big advantage over the rest of us.
he understood television.
and now, the host of Frost Over Australia,
Mr. David Frost!
thank you, thank you.
hello. Good evening.
and with the eyes of the world focused on the White House, here in Australia, burglars have broken into a meat factory in Brisbane and stolen a ton of pork sausages.
the Queensland police are looking for men in a long, thin getaway car.
now, my first guest tonight...
well, we in the Nixon camp really didn't know that much about David Frost, other than he was a British talk show host with something of a playboy reputation.
he'd had a talk show here in the US that had won some awards but hadn't syndicated well and had been dropped by the network.
he ended up taking it down to Australia, which is, I believe, where he was when the President resigned.
next week's guest will be Evonne Goolagong.
we'll see you then. God bless.
great show, David. Thanks, Noah.
come and look at this.
Nixon leaving the White House.
a dark day for Richard Nixon, who has drawn crowds to the vast Ellipse south of the White House before.
what, this is live? Yeah.
but those were triumphs. This is not.
what time is it in Washington?
9: 00 a. m.
why didn't he wait?
it's 6: 00 in the morning on the West Coast.
half his audience is still asleep.
all right, you blokes, let's get the set broken down.
are witnesses to the saddest day in the life of Richard Nixon, his last moments as President of the United States, a moment unlike any other in the history of this country.
richard Nixon, who goes now from the power of the presidency to a form of exile in California.
find out the numbers for this, will you? Worldwide.
I remember his face.
staring out the window.
down below him, a liberal America cheered, gloated.
hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes, the same people who'd spit on me when I got back from Vietnam.
they'd gotten rid of Richard Nixon, their bogeyman.
so what's so important that it couldn't wait, that it had to be today?
I've had an idea, John, rather a bold idea for an interview.
fish and chips, please.
and in a moment...
well, it's too late now. It's done.
I've called his people...
you?
beans, peas and lamb, please.
and made an offer.
now, if the subject were to say yes, well, he's rather a big fish that swims in not-untricky waters.
so it goes without saying that I'd want a dear friend and the finest producer I know by my side.
so who is it?
richard Nixon.
richard Nixon?
well, come on, don't look like that.
well, how would you expect me to look?
I spent yesterday evening watching you interview the Bee Gees.
weren't they terrific?
come on, John, we've done political interviews before.
so, okay, so what kind of interview?
a full, extensive look-back over his life, his presidency.
And?
and what? Come on, David.
surely the only thing that would interest anyone about Richard Nixon would be a confession.
a full, no-holds-barred confession.
well, we'll get that, too.
from Richard Nixon?
come on, John.
just think of the numbers it would get.
do you know how many people watched his farewell speech in the White House?
four hundred million.
but in the end, David heard nothing.
and soon after arriving in California,
Nixon was rushed to hospital with an acute attack of phlebitis.
I think it was around this time that Gerald Ford, who was the new President, and who was desperate to move the agenda on from Watergate, gave Nixon a full, free and absolute pardon.
now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
president of the United States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States.
it meant that the man who had committed the greatest felony in American political history would never stand trial.
it was like he slipped out the back door.
a public opinion poll indicates a two-to-one disapproval of the pardoning of Richard Nixon.
one telegram from Virginia said, "Roosevelt had his New Deal" , "Truman had his Fair Deal" , now Ford has his crooked deal.
there was no deal, period.
I don't think the truth will ever come out.
the American people need to know the truth, and I don't think it will ever now be fully known.
so how do we want to address the college protests?
well, do we want to lift some quotes from the "stand up and be counted" speech in 1970?
sir? You know, maybe we're just better off using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.
just include the whole thing.
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.
okay. No, no, stick around.
you're gonna get a kick out of this.
this is my literary agent from Hollywood.
hygiene obsessive.
Mr. President, good to see you.
nice to see you.
these are folks helping me with my book.
Diane Sawyer, Frank Gannon, Irving Lazar.
nice to meet you. Miss Sawyer.
pleasure. Mr. Gannon.
okay, that's it. I'll see you after lunch.
so how you feeling, sir?
I'm better, thank you. Though not yet well enough to golf, thank God. I despise that game.
imagine, six weeks out of office as President of the United States, and they'd have me putting in my hospital room.
never retire, Mr. Lazar.
to me, the unhappiest people of the world are retired.
no purpose.
what makes life mean something is purpose.
a goal. A battle. A struggle.
well, even if you don't win it.
when my doctor declared me unfit to give testimony in the Watergate trial, everybody thought I'd be relieved.
well, they were wrong.
that was the lowest I got.
well, if it's a challenge you want, here's one you might enjoy.
how to spend $2 million, 2. 3 to be precise.
it's what I got for your memoirs.
well, thank you.
eh...
it might be a little short of what I wanted, but let me assure you, it's a whole lot more than they wanted.
that book is important to me.
it's probably the only chance I'm gonna get to put the record straight and remind people the Nixon years weren't all bad.
you know, if you're trying to put the record straight,
I'd at least talk to him.
who?
david Frost. English talk show guy.
why would I want to talk to David Frost?
well, a while back, he wrote asking for an interview.
no.
well, we didn't get back to him.
frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.
well, I thought that we were doing one with CBS.
we are. I just figured doing it with Frost would be a whole lot easier than doing it with Mike Wallace.
it would, but it would have a lot less, you know, credibility.
true, true. Could probably get more money.
Really? Look.
we'll always have 350 on the table from CBS.
but if I could get Frost to pay more and secure better terms, it might be a shame to pass.
it'd be interesting to know where he is right now.
we tied him to railway tracks, and he escaped.
we buried him alive, and he walked free.
today we're lowering escape artist Derek Harrison into the water to see if he can miraculously cheat death once more.
good evening, and welcome to Great Escapes.
my name is David Frost.
okay, that is a cut.
thank you.
in any deal, you need to know your opponent's breaking point.
to assess that, you might call them late at night or at the weekend.
if they take the call, you know they're desperate.
and from that moment on, you know you have the upper hand.
Hello?
Mr. Frost? Irving Lazar.
who?
swifty Lazar. I represent President Nixon.
what time is it?
bad time?
No! Not at all.
I'm calling with regard to your request for an interview and to say, having considered it, my client is not necessarily opposed to the idea.
Really? Well, that's terrific news!
for God's sake.
I got $500, 000.
is that good?
Mr. President, it's a half a million dollars for a news interview.
it's unprecedented.
yeah? Well, what's the catch?
with Frost? None. It'll be a big wet kiss.
this guy'll be so grateful to be getting it at all, he'll pitch puffballs all night and pay a half a million dollars for the privilege.
well, you think you could get 550?
I got 6.
David, how could you have done that? What?
$600, 000. That's a fortune.
200 on signature?
don't worry about the money.
my God. Most Americans think he belongs in jail.
you're making him a rich man.
Plus, by outbidding them, you've already made enemies of the networks. They're just jealous.
they're already sounding off about checkbook journalism.
and if the networks are against you, syndication's always going to be a struggle.
no syndication, no advance sales.
no advance sales, no commercials.
no commercials, no revenue.
and here's the bigger question, why do it? You don't need it.
your career's in great shape.
this will just spread you across three continents, jeopardize the other shows.
isn't it true that Channel Nine in Australia want you to do another season of your talk show for them?
Yes. And London, too?
Yes, but that would be London and Australia.
this would be... What?
you wouldn't understand, John.
you were never part of the show in New York, but it's indescribable.
success in America is unlike success anywhere else.
and the emptiness when it's gone.
and the sickening thought that it may never come back.
you know, there's a restaurant in New York called Sardi's.
ordinary mortals can't get a table.
John, the place was my canteen!
you know, I'd be happier if I heard some kind of vision that you had for this interview.
excuse me, Mr. Frost.
I'd heard you were going to be here.
would you mind? Of course.
but I don't. I just hear a man doing it because it would create headlines or give him a place at the top table.
and that is what makes me nervous.
and you do nervous so beautifully, John.
Hello, good evening and welcome.
I don't actually say that.
Hello, Mr. Frost.
champagne?
no, thank you.
another glass, sir?
you don't like champagne?
not on airplanes.
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.
the trick is to have a glass of water on the go, too.
like the Viennese serve coffee.
well, I've never been to Vienna.
Oh. Well, you'd like it.
it's like Paris without the French.
what's your name?
Caroline.
David.
Yes, I know. David Frost.
hello and good evening and welcome.
you know, I heard an interview with you recently on the radio.
you were giving it from the back of your Rolls-Royce.
Bentley.
on the phone.
they said that you were a person who defined the age we live in.
Really? Mmm.
you and Vidal Sassoon.
but what made you exceptional, they said, was that you were a person who had achieved great fame without possessing any discernible quality.
how kind. Mmm-hmm.
and that you fly around a great deal.
well, that's true.
Why?
I like to keep busy.
Why?
I find it more interesting than keeping still.
you know, you have very sad eyes.
do I? Mmm.
has anyone told you that before?
no.
are you a sad person?
let's talk about you a little bit.
of course, you feel more comfortable asking questions.
how right you are!
this is your captain speaking.
you may have noticed we've begun our final descent into Los Angeles.
if you could please return to your seats and fasten your seat belts, we'll be landing very shortly. Thank you.
so how about you? Where are you going?
to meet Richard Nixon.
Really?
you know, they say he has the most enormous head, but the sexiest voice.
where is he now?
in some dark underground cave licking his wounds?
actually, no. In his rather smart beachside villa in California.
Really? Richard Nixon in a beachside villa?
how incongruous.
you can come if you'd like.
to meet Nixon?
why not?
are you sure?
you know, I would love that.
cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.
well, I'll get my office to call you first thing in the morning and send a car with a phone.
Oh.
he did, too. Money no object.
everything glittered and was golden.
well, on the outside.
of course, what I didn't know was that in the meantime, he'd gone to all the major networks to try and get interest in the interviews.
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy of not paying for a news interview.
look, we love your work as an entertainer.
that Guinness show?
love it. You're a funny guy.
but an interview like this?
you're asking us to pay a British talk show host to interview an American president with absolutely no editorial controls whatsoever in return?
well, you can't say it's not a fresh approach.
I know you're very busy.
I'm not gonna keep you from it.
thank you for coming in.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
okay, thank you so much for your time.
David, good luck.
he never let on to anyone at the time,
Thanks.
... admitting failure, and David doesn't do failure.
there you are.
see, you don't have to do a thing yourself.
well.
you found it okay.
Yes, thank you.
pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.
and you, sir.
may I present Caroline Cushing?
miss Cushing.
hello. Your house is very beautiful.
really. Very romantic.
well, thank you.
and my producer, John Birt.
nice to meet you. How do you do?
this is Mr. Lazar, and this is Jack Brennan.
now, Miss Cushing, would you like to take a tour, you know, maybe stretch your legs after your long journey?
Yes, please. I'd love that. Thank you.
come on in. This is my office.
now, this is where Brezhnev and I had our summit.
Yeah. Brezhnev was there, and Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.
we talked for nine hours straight.
after the meeting, as a souvenir of the visit,
I remember that we had a Lincoln specially made.
dark blue, cherry wood, leather.
well, we got inside for the photographers, when the next thing you know, he steps on the gas.
now, the first rule of political life is you never let a president get behind the wheel of a car, ever.
I mean, we're not used to doing anything for ourselves, let alone drive.
and the Chairman, Jesus, the way he put his foot down, my guess is the last thing he drove was a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.
he crashed into curbs.
he went over speed bumps.
he went twice around my whole estate.
finally, we ended up at some remote point on the coast, out there overlooking the sea.
he turns off the gas, and he talks for two hours about his favorite subject, steel mills.
he said, "Mr. President, most politicians" have tragedy in their early lives.
well, I told him that I lost two brothers to tuberculosis.
and he watched his father die from the cancer he caught in the steelworks.
he was a sad man and a noble adversary.
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.
they never know when they're being taped.
okay, I guess that's it then, huh?
until March. I look forward to it.
well, thank you, Mr. President. So do I.
you know, it's a funny thing that...
I've never been challenged to a duel before.
I guess that's what this is.
Yeah, well, not really.
of course it is.
and I like that.
no holds barred, eh? No holds barred.
Mr. Frost, there's still the small matter of the...
of course.
I do beg your pardon.
right. $200, 000.
I do hope that isn't coming out of your own pocket.
well, believe me, sir, I wish my pockets were that deep.
made out in the name of?
irving Paul Lazar.
richard M. Nixon.
here you go.
okay, smile.
there. Now you can put that in your apartment in New York, and all your liberal friends can use it as a dartboard.
well, actually, I'm living in Monte Carlo at the moment.
Really?
Yes. Goodbye, Mr. President.
Hey. Take my advice.
you should marry that woman.
Yes. Lovely, isn't she?
more important than that, she comes from Monaco.
they pay no taxes there.
Bye-bye. Goodbye.
I bet you it did.
what?
come out of his own pocket.
you know, he couldn't look me in the eye.
well, I hear the networks aren't biting.
without the networks, the ad agencies don't want to know.
this whole thing may never happen.
Really? So that meeting we just had might have cost him $200, 000?
correct.
had I known that, I would have offered him a cup of tea.
say, did you notice his shoes?
no.
Italian. No laces. What do you think?
my people tried to get me to wear a pair like that.
I think a man's shoes should have laces, sir.
you do?
Yeah. Personally, I find those Italian shoes very effeminate.
Yes, quite right.
I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.
try to look at it from our point of view.
why would an American network hire a total outsider, and someone who's already had his own show canceled, incidentally?
I see. Well, I'm sorry you feel this way.
obviously, I think you're making a terrible mistake.
NBC.
well, that's the networks out, all of them.
well, that's the end of that, then.
I'm sorry, David.
not so fast.
Where's your adventurer's spirit?
the idea is we pay for the program and syndicate it ourselves, completely bypassing the networks.
just imagine it, we'd be our own network for the night.
Hey, Bob. How does that grab you?
Hey, come on in. David's on the phone.
no, never been done before.
historic stuff.
just think about it, okay? And call me back.
yeah? Yeah.
David, I'd like you to meet Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick, our two prospective corner men.
delighted to meet you.
come on in. Make yourselves at home.
Bob's been Washington correspondent for Public Radio for the past 10 years.
moving to ABC in the new year.
the general feeling, David, is that I have been wasting my matinee idol looks on radio.
Jim here teaches at the University of North Carolina and is writing a book about the criminal dishonesty, corruption, paranoia and abuses of power of Richard Nixon.
second on the subject.
fourth.
well, delighted to have you both aboard.
actually, before I sign on, I would like to hear what you were hoping to achieve with this interview.
what I want to achieve?
Yeah.
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.
that's close to 30 hours with the most compelling and controversial politician of our times.
isn't that enough?
well, not for me.
look, I'd be giving up a year of my life. I'm leaving my family to work on a subject matter that means more than you can probably imagine, and the idea of doing all that without achieving what I want to, personally, would be unthinkable to me.
no, all right.
well, what is it that you want to achieve?
I'd like to give Richard Nixon the trial he never had.
of course, we'll be asking difficult questions.
difficult questions.
the man lost 21, 000 Americans and a million Indo-Chinese during his administration.
he only escaped jail because of Ford's pardon.
Yes, but equally, going after him in some knee-jerk way, you know, assuming he's a terrible guy, wouldn't that only create more sympathy for him than anything else?
you know...
right now, I submit it's impossible to feel anything close to sympathy for Richard Nixon.
he devalued the presidency, and he left the country that elected him in trauma.
the American people need a conviction, pure and simple.
the integrity of our political system, of democracy as an idea, entirely depends on it.
and if in years to come, people look back and say it was in this interview that Richard Nixon exonerated himself, that would be the worst crime of all.
did you know that Mike Wallace is doing a piece on this?
and that in the bars around Capitol Hill and Georgetown this entire project is a joke?
come on. Jim, come on.
thanks for that, Jim.
could you give us a couple of minutes?
you're unbelievable. I'm sorry, Bob.
you know, Jim, I went way out on a limb for you.
I mean, some of us actually want this job.
I want it, too, if it's done right.
well, how do you know they're not gonna do it right?
little Lord Fauntleroy in there?
sympathy for Richard Nixon?
what the... He's full of shit, man!
how do you know that?
is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?
apparently.
why didn't you tell me?
it isn't relevant.
what's the angle? "British talk show host, " good with actresses, not so good with stonewalling presidents.
that's the general idea, yeah.
right.
it's hard not to feel a little insulted by that.
well, Bob's obviously a pro.
what are we gonna do about Reston?
well, the man's an idiot. He's overemotional.
send him home.
well, I think he should stay. Why?
I liked his passion.
he will drive us all bloody mad.
well, maybe, but sometimes being out of your comfort zone is a good thing, I'm told.
he stays.
I took my seat next to Mrs. Mao at the banquet table.
now, one of the challenges of life as a president is the endless round of cocktail parties, social engagements, banquets.
and people who know me would tell you that small talk is not one of my strong suits, either. No.
particularly not in Mandarin.
so Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well, you know, stared at one another.
and then across the table, Mrs. Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well, they stared at one another, too.
and then further down, Dr. Kissinger and their foreign minister, well, you're getting the picture now.
I can't stand it, Jack!
reducing the presidency to a series of banal anecdotes.
I feel like a circus animal doing tricks.
and I thought I made it clear!
I didn't want to take any questions on Watergate, damn it!
soon as it came to question time, all those sons of bitches ever want to hear about is Watergate!
it's as if all my other achievements have ceased to exist.
well, sir, you're gonna get a chance to talk about them sooner than you think.
yeah? How?
frost got there. He got the money.
what?
I understand most of it's borrowed, that his friends have bailed him out.
but the point is, we start taping at the end of March.
Really? Now, that's terrific.
how much time is devoted to Watergate?
25%. Just one of four 90-minute shows.
what are the other three divided into?
domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy, and Nixon the Man.
"nixon the Man" ?
as opposed to what? Nixon the horse?
well, I imagine it's some kind of biographical piece.
I can see it now. The father that neglected me, the brothers that died.
spare me.
still, now, the fact it's come together, now, that's a good thing, no?
Mr. President, it's fantastic.
frost is just not in your intellectual class, sir.
you're gonna be able to dictate terms, rebuild your reputation.
if this went well, if enough people saw it, revised their opinion, you could move back East way, way earlier than we expected.
you think? I'm certain.
it would be so good to go back to where the action is.
you know?
the hunger in my belly is still there, Jack.
I guess it all boils down to Watergate, huh?
well, that's nothing to worry about, sir.
it's not as if there's gonna be any revelations.
that stuff's been combed over a million times.
no one has pinned anything on you.
Yeah, still, it's been a while since I spoke about it on the record.
I'm gonna start doing my homework.
Hey, you know what would be an interesting thing to find out?
what his strategy is.
now, where's he staying?
I believe The Beverly Hilton.
the Beverly Hilton, you say.
well, I got the numbers someplace of some fellows that we could send in.
cubans with CIA training.
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.
Yes, sir.
a week later, we said goodbye to our families, we hopped on a plane, and we moved into The Beverly Hilton.
and that's where we started to dig into our research and prepare for the interviews.
Yeah, as it happens, we took the whole question of security very seriously.
and from day one, we kept all our files in a locked safe.
who was the guy that Mike interviewed? Was that Haldeman?
Haldeman. Haldeman. And Ehrlichman, too.
I always get the Germans mixed up.
I'm a little confused by that.
what is Haldeman's official... Hello, darling.
as for the work over the months, we divided it into three sections.
birt took Vietnam, Bob took Foreign and Domestic Policy, and I got Watergate and the abuses of power.
and David, we never really saw much of David.
all right, so what about the Huston Plan?
you can see the seeds of dirty tricks.
essentially, it's an attempt to legalize dirty tricks.
that's why you gotta get David to put it in the question.
wiretapping students.
but they've traced the money to him.
opening people's mail.
what about wiretapping?
how many people has he wiretapped?
this guy wiretapped 17 people.
Seventeen?
including his own brother.
but you know what? We can't ask him about his brother, 'cause frankly, if Donald Nixon was my brother,
I'd wiretap him, too.
but wait, okay, so we have breaking and entering.
we have wiretapping, conspiracy to foster prostitution.
and that's Liddy, right?
delivery courtesy of Nate 'n al's finest deli selection.
we're going to need napkins. We'd better have some napkins.
how do we frame a question about Cambodia, about the illicit bombing of
I think you should say, "how far do you take executive privilege" before it becomes an undemocratic event?
I think you frame the question to him as a Quaker.
how do you feel as a Quaker about annihilating an entire people?
come on. Are they really interested in buying time?
are they going to give us the money?
how serious are they?
you have to set up that he has an anti-democratic personality.
there's a reason they call him Tricky Dick.
because I had written about and watched Nixon for years,
I got to play him in our rehearsals.
you know, the fellas would throw me a question, and I would try and anticipate what his response might be.
okay, the White House taping system.
ours is not the first administration to use taping systems.
lyndon Johnson's White House used them. So did Kennedy's.
HUSTON Plan. Wiretapping and alleged abuses of power.
let me tell you, other administrations were up to far worse.
and just for fun, your close friend Jack Kennedy.
that man, he screwed anything that moved, fixed elections and took us into Vietnam.
and the American people, they loved him for it!
whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon, worked around the clock in their service, and they hated me!
look. Look. Now I'm sweating.
damn it! Damn it!
and Kennedy's so goddamn handsome and blue-eyed!
and women all over him!
he screwed anything that moved, and everything.
had a go at Checkers once.
the poor little bitch was never the same!
gentlemen, finally a friend in the American press.
Jack Anderson in The Washington Post, "When Richard Nixon faces the television cameras" for his first interview since he abandoned the White House, "he'll be cross-examined as if he were on the witness stand.
frost has hired three crack investigators" to help him with the research.
clearly the famous TV interviewer will pull no punches.
"crack investigators"?
can I be Crack One?
can I be Deep Crack?
David, can I talk to you for a sec?
after researching my last book,
I was pretty certain Colson...
you know, Charles Colson? His darkest henchman?
sometime before June 23, but I never knew the exact date, so I couldn't find the transcript.
but if you gave me a week back in the Federal Courthouse library...
a week? Goodness, Jim, we can't lose you for that long.
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.
would there be something I could help you with?
you know, if we're gonna nail Nixon in these interviews, we're gonna have to ambush him.
we're gonna have to take him by surprise.
don't worry, Jim. We'll get him anyway.
hang on a second. David, Jack Brennan.
he sounds a little emotional.
I'll take it in here.
he'll be right with you. Yeah.
Jack. Watergate.
Yes, Jack.
our lawyers want us to agree on a definition of the word.
well, I believe it's a large hotel and office complex in Washington, Jack.
you know what I'm talking about.
for the interviews.
we want to propose that Watergate be an umbrella term for everything negative.
hold on a minute.
so all the other domestic charges against him, the Brookings Institute, the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List, you're saying all that goes into Watergate?
correct.
that is absurd and a clear breach of the terms of our agreement.
okay. How would you define Watergate?
well, that it covers just that.
the Watergate break-in of June 17th and the subsequent cover-up and investigation.
fine. In which case, the deal is off.
fine. In which case, you can expect a lawsuit for something in excess of $20 million in damages and loss of earnings.
the terms of the contract clearly stipulate that Watergate take up no more than 25% of the time.
Yes, but nowhere does it say that for the rest of the 75%.
he gets to drone on and sound presidential.
"drone on"? Jesus Christ. Where's your respect?
you remember who you're talking about here.
you know as well as I do that 60% of what he did in office was right, and 30% may have been wrong, but he thought it was right at the time.
Yes, but that still leaves 10% where he was doing the wrong thing and knew it.
you goddamn media people. You are so smug.
well, I can guarantee you if you screw us on the 60%, I will ruin you if it takes the rest of my life.
prick.
look at you. Gorgeous.
good night, sweet princes.
cheerio. Bye.
see you in the morning.
why the monkey suit?
david has a film premiere he needs to attend.
what? The night before we start taping?
what's the movie?
it's The Slipper and the Rose.
the Cinderella movie?
Yeah. David's the executive producer.
you don't think it might be an idea for our interviewer to be rested and focused on the job in hand?
don't worry.
david is a performer of the highest caliber.
he's been in these pressure situations many times before.
come the hour, he'll be fine. Okay?
what did he say? Did he say "performer"?
Yeah. That's the word he used?
Yeah, he said "performer."
not "journalist" or "interviewer"?
no. He said "performer."
out of curiosity, where are you at this moment? Psychically?
I am imagining the dust, the darkness, the agony and the unimaginable Ioneliness of the wilderness I am about to be dispatched to by my Washington political colleagues.
so any opportunity you get, go right to foreign policy, go right to Mao, go right to Khrushchev.
just go right!
you could do all day on foreign policy, sir.
I disagree that the Mao banquet story is stale.
excuse me, sir. Something I think you should see.
people love that story.
why don't we save it for the book?
Yeah, right, come on.
David. Mr. Frost.
David, some people in the media have suggested that you're not the right man for the job, that you'll be too soft on the President.
what will you do if he stonewalls you?
well, I shall say so again and again.
but I should say right now that I'm not expecting his approach to be to stonewall.
I'm hoping that it'll be that of a cascade of candor.
"a cascade of candor"?
from Richard Nixon?
you think that's what you'll get?
no, I just thought it was a phrase that might appeal to you.
so what about the money?
that's a strange fellow.
started life as a comic, you know.
is that so? Mmm-hmm.
almost married Diahann Carroll.
who?
the singer.
isn't she black?
Yes, sir.
right here in the Frost file, which we put together as part of our general preparations.
okay. Let's get back to work.
that's fact, this is fiction.
so now it's about The Slipper and the Rose.
it's a cracker of a movie.
I hope you'll all come and see it, and...
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.
just don't drink any more.
good luck. Thank you.
I'll be thinking of you.
Dick. Wait.
for the record, I'm gonna be starting with John's idea.
why didn't you burn the tapes?
no. Fuck.
please, God, no! You can't.
David, you can't do that. It would be a disaster.
it would get us into Watergate way ahead of the agreed time.
what is the point of having contractually set specific times to deal with certain subjects if you're just going to ignore it right off the bat?
cause it's war, isn't it? Gloves off.
I like it. It's ballsy.
strategically, it'll give us the upper hand.
it's insanely risky.
he could walk right off the set, and there's nothing we could do about it.
worse, he could sue you!
we were sadly unable to do the taping at Casa Pacifica because of the Coast Guard radio interference, so we ended up at the rather more modest Smith house, which was owned by a local Republican businessman.
right here!
Mr. Frost, look over here.
over here, sir!
here we go. Back up behind the curb.
a few questions, please.
right here, Mr. Frost.
David! David! David!
well, hello there.
excuse me, fellas.
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!
liar!
here comes the President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
how are you feeling, Mr. President?
the Smith family requested that the furniture be put back in place.
they talked to you about that, too?
they're bugging everybody.
you know, I've written four books about him, but this is the first time I've actually seen him in the flesh.
he's taller than I imagined, and tanned.
the least he could do is look ravaged.
you gonna shake his hand?
am I gonna shake...
are you kidding me?
after everything that prick's done to this country?
I'm not gonna shake his hand.
gentlemen.
may I present Bob Zelnick, my executive editor?
how do you do?
pleasure, Mr. President.
and Jim Reston, one of my researchers.
pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.
Mr. President.
excuse me, sir? Got a room for you right here.
Wow. That was devastating, withering.
I mean, I don't think he's ever gonna get over that.
Yeah, fuck off.
I got you guys set up back here.
now this is your green room.
and the President will be on the large monitor.
craft services is that way.
keep it about that temperature, okay?
Mr. President?
Yeah.
before we start, I just want to say how delighted we all are by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.
well, thank you. It's true.
she's much better now.
she's just getting round to the business of replying to all the cards.
and from our point of view, well,
I'd just like to say how pleased we are that you got this all together.
thank you.
as I understand it, it's been quite a struggle.
well...
how much has it cost?
you mind me asking? Hey, come on.
come on, it's just between us.
very well. Two million.
two million? Jeez. I didn't realize we were making Ben-Hur.
but tell me something.
you raised it all now?
not quite. But we're getting there.
everyone's been kind and deferred fees.
well, not quite everyone.
David, I'm gonna go in with you on camera.
excuse me.
I want to put a handkerchief here, if I may.
is that out of shot?
that's fine, Mr. President.
Contractually, I think that we made an agreement that after each question I might dab my upper lip before answering it.
which you won't show, you know, when you cut it together.
you're probably aware of my history with perspiration.
if you're referring to your TV debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.
they say that moisture on my upper lip cost me the presidency.
people who heard it on the radio, well, they thought I'd won.
but television and the close-up, they create their own sets of meanings.
so now they insist I bring a handkerchief and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.
sixty seconds, everyone.
you trim yours? No.
no, of course not.
Yeah, you're light-skinned. Yeah.
you got blue eyes. You've got no troubles with perspiration, I imagine.
no, not that I'm aware.
you were obviously born to be on the tube.
stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.
settling.
those shoes.
they're Italian, aren't they?
my shoes? I believe so.
Yeah, that's interesting.
you don't find them too effeminate?
no.
well, I guess somebody in your field can get away with them, you know.
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?
David, starting with camera two, in four, three, two. Cue David. And...
Mr. President. Now, we're going to be covering a lot of subjects in a great deal of detail over the course of these interviews, but I'd like to begin completely out of context by asking you one question, more than any other, almost every American and people all over the world want me to ask.
why didn't you burn the tapes?
son of a bitch!
well, Mr. Frost, I'm surprised by your question since we have an agreement, a contractual agreement, I believe, that we would cover Watergate in our last taping session.
but if your viewers really do have a major concern, then perhaps I should briefly respond to it now.
what probably very few people realize is that the taping system in the White House was set up by my predecessor, President Johnson, partly to avoid the necessity of having a secretary in every meeting, and partly to ensure there was a record kept of every verbal agreement, no matter how off the cuff or casual.
now, initially, on coming into the White House,
I insisted on dismantling the system.
help us, Father, help us! - What about some food?
father, they're starving us! - Are you staying, Father?
this man is raving.
are you sure you wish to see him on your own?
a visitor for you, Baron Frankenstein.
if you need any assistance, I shall be outside.
they told me you wanted to see me.
is it spiritual comfort you want? Is that it?
keep your spiritual comfort for those who think they need it.
I sent for you because I could think of nobody else.
people trust you.
they listen to what you tell them.
now listen to me, and when I've finished you can pass it on to them.
then, perhaps, they'll believe me.
I have to tell you... - I have to tell you, you just listen!
I'm sorry. If you think my word will carry any authority, I'm afraid you are mistaken.
you'd better not tell me what you consider so important.
you'll stay. - Take your hands off me.
tell me you'll stay. - Do you want me to call the guard?
I apologize. Please, sit down.
I said I apologize. I'll not forget myself again.
as you wish.
unless I can convince you...
...that what I'm about to tell you is the absolute truth...
...then in one hour from now I shall be dead.
I've told you... - Then, perhaps, you'll understand.
perhaps you'd better start from the beginning.
where did it all begin?
I suppose it was when I was a boy at school.
I always had a brilliant intellect.
that fool who taught us may have been able to hoodwink the others...
...but what did he know?
he'd been teaching the same rubbish for 30 years...
...and I don't suppose he'd read a new book for 20 of those.
when my mother died, I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.
this enabled me to begin the life and work I had always planned for myself.
Victor, dear boy...
...you are the sole remaining member of the Frankenstein family.
I know you will conduct yourself in a manner which would make your poor, dear mother proud of you.
I shall do my best, Uncle. Thank you.
thank you all for coming.
goodbye.
what was it you wished to see me about, Aunt Sophie?
it is a matter of some delicacy, Victor. I...
was it about the allowance my mother made you?
you needn't worry. I shall continue to pay it.
you're a good boy, Victor. Your poor mother would be proud...
Yes, yes. - Elizabeth, thank your cousin.
there's really no need.
come along, Elizabeth. Say thank you, nicely.
thank you.
she's a good girl. She'll grow into a fine woman one day.
I'm sure she will. - And she'll make someone a good wife.
goodbye. - Well, goodbye.
the first of the month, your mother used to...
I understand. I shall do the same. - Thank you.
good morning.
is this the home of the Frankenstein family?
it is.
I'm Paul Krempe. I have an appointment with Baron Frankenstein.
you must be Victor. I'm going to be your tutor.
so I understand.
but surely it isn't settled yet.
I thought this was just an interview to decide...
...whether you were suitable for the position.
Yes, but I've had correspondence with the Baron...
...and he seemed satisfied with my qualifications.
that's right, he did, didn't he?
I expect he wanted to see what I look like. - That must have been it.
will you tell your father that I'm here? - My father is dead.
that's ridiculous. I had a letter... - He's been dead for 10 years.
it was I who advertised for a tutor. It was I who wrote to you.
you're the Baron then, are you?
and have been since I was 5 years old.
and you want a tutor for your son?
I thought it would save a lot of explanation by letter.
a difficult thing at the best of times.
I fail to see that the disclosure of the facts can make any difference.
you were to be engaged as my tutor, subject to the Baron's approval.
you will take up the position. You will be paid as arranged.
by whom?
by the Baron. I'm quite rich.
do you still want the position?
I should be honored, Herr Baron.
my first opinion of Paul was soon confirmed.
he turned out to be an admirable tutor.
in two years I'd learned all he had to teach, but we went on together...
...probing into the unknown, investigating, recording, searching...
...always searching...
...until gradually the sweep of our research began to assume a single direction...
...and to this aim we finally turned all our energies.
it took us years of unrelenting work to discover what we were seeking.
then, one night...
...out of sight and sound of the rest of the house...
...our efforts were rewarded.
Paul, it's alive.
Paul, we've done it!
Paul, we've done it!
there was a lag between the cardiac reaction and the first visible signs of life.
that'll be the time required for the heart to circulate blood through the entire body.
if we could delay or prolong the period in which the body is apparently dead while the heart is alive...
...we'd have a living body with only the barest life-spark present.
think what that would mean when it came to performing major surgery!
we could save hundreds of lives.
reducing shock to a minimum, no loss of blood.
Victor, the Medical Federation meets next month in Berne.
can we have our paper ready?
we could.
but we're not going to. - Why not?
it doesn't meet again for a year. Why wait that long?
we must wait.
what we've done up to now is nothing to what we will do.
we've only just started. Just opened the door.
now is the time to go through that door and find what lies beyond it.
don't you see, Paul? We've discovered the source of life itself...
...and have used it to restore a creature that was dead.
this is a tremendous discovery, but we mustn't share it yet.
we must move on to the next stage.
we've restored life where life was extinct.
it's no longer sufficient to bring the dead back to life.
we must create from the beginning. We must build up our own creature...
...and build it up from nothing.
from what? What on earth are you talking about?
forget the whole. Now we must take the parts...
...limbs, organs, and then we must build.
build what? - The most complex thing known to man:
man himself.
we must create a human being...
...with perfect physique, hands of an artist, and a matured brain of a genius.
we can do it. Don't you see? - No, I don't.
what you're saying is nonsense, a revolt against nature.
such a thing could only end in evil.
come, what's the matter with you? You haven't shown any scruples up to now.
as for revolting against nature, haven't we done so already and succeeded?
isn't the thing that's dead supposed to be dead for all time?
yet we brought it back to life.
we hold in the palms of our hands secrets that have never been dreamed of.
where nature puts up barriers to confine the scope of man, we've broken through!
there's nothing to stop us now. - What is it you want to do?
first we need the framework, the body.
last week they hanged a man at Engelstadt, a highwayman.
he'd been terrifying the countryside for months. As a warning to others...
...his body has been left on a gibbet, just outside the town.
it'll hang there till it rots...
...or it's stolen.
the birds didn't waste much time, did they?
the eyes...
half the head is eaten away.
what are you going to do?
take the head off. It's no use to me anyway.
it's in the acid. A few minutes, and there'll be no trace.
Paul, give me a hand with his clothes, will you?
look at those hands.
great clodhopping things. No wonder he was a robber.
with hands like those, he couldn't have been anything else.
except, perhaps, a gorilla.
I don't think we should continue with this.
we should wait and present our findings at the Federation.
should anything go wrong... - I've got it.
what? - Look after things while I'm gone.
gone where?
if I leave tonight, I should get back by tomorrow evening.
Victor! - Yes, Paul, what is it?
what are you talking about? Where are you going?
going?
I'm going away for a little while. I'll tell you about it when I get back.
better not touch our friend here while I'm gone. Let him rest in peace...
...while he can. Let's have some food, I'm hungry.
I thought it was the master.
no, he hasn't come back yet, Justine.
will he be in time for dinner, sir?
I don't know, he didn't say.
there he is now, sir.
good evening, Baron Frankenstein is expecting me. May I come in?
I shall need some assistance with my luggage.
luggage? - Yes, I'm coming to stay.
well, I'm sorry, miss, but the Baron told no one of this.
but he must have done. I wrote him some weeks ago.
Victor, how happy I am to see you.
I'm afraid there's some mistake.
mistake?
didn't you get my letter?
I'm not Victor, I'm Paul Krempe.
Oh, Paul Krempe. I'm so sorry.
I haven't seen Victor for so long. - Now that you know who I am...
...why not tell me who you are?
I'm Elizabeth, Victor's cousin. Didn't he tell you about me?
no, he did not.
for which he will be severely reprimanded when he returns.
Oh, he's away? - He's expected back at any moment.
we shan't have long to wait.
are you going to stay with us long?
I'm coming to live here.
this is to be my home. - Live here? But...
Paul, I...
Elizabeth.
Victor.
Elizabeth.
I received your letter. I was so sorry to hear about your mother.
how are you, my dear?
the maid will show you to your room.
Paul, come see what I've got. Elizabeth, we'll see you at dinner.
Yes, but... - Paul, come on.
as he said, we will see you at dinner.
lock the door, Paul. Come and look at these.
what about these? Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?
Bardello's hands.
the hands of the world's greatest sculptor.
where did you get them?
Leipzig. I heard that Bardello died there last week.
all it needed was a little bribery. - You realize what this means?
it means that our friend will have the finest hands any man ever possessed.
I mean your cousin's arrival.
we can't continue with this experiment. Not here, anyway.
what are you talking about? - Elizabeth. She might find out.
what if she does? Where's the harm?
she's young, Victor.
her mind would be incapable of receiving such a shock.
all right! You can't see the horror of what you're doing.
at first I was blind to it.
and now?
while you were away, I decided I could not continue with this experiment.
I hope I can convince you I'm right, change your mind, too.
you'll never do that, Paul.
in six months, you'll rejoice in the fact...
...you helped make this discovery. You'll be as famous as I.
no, Victor. Infamous! I will not help you, not anymore.
I beseech you.
give this up, if not for your own sake, for the sake of the girl.
you're wasting your time, Paul.
help me graft these hands on. I want to see if they take.
can't you understand? I will not help you anymore.
and I shall try to make Elizabeth leave here.
Elizabeth won't leave, Paul.
if you're really not going to help me, I'd be glad if you'd leave me alone.
I have work to do.
I shan't be down for dinner. Make my excuses to Elizabeth, will you?
will you require anything else? - No, thank you, that will be all.
very well, sir.
I shall take the master's dinner up now.
leave it outside the door.
of course, Herr Krempe, I always do.
do you take your coffee black or white, Paul?
Elizabeth, I don't know you very well, but I want you to do something for me.
yes?
leave here.
leave?
leave this house at once, and never come back.
that's impossible. Why do you ask it?
I can't explain, but it will not be safe here.
not safe?
Victor will be here, won't he?
Oh, yes. Victor will be here. - Then I fail to see...
it's because of Victor that I'm asking you to leave.
he's conducting experiments which could be very dangerous.
what sort of experiments?
you wouldn't understand. - I would understand, I'm sure.
please, tell me.
believe me, I can't tell you, I would if I could.
then I shall have to ask Victor.
if I'm to marry him, then I have a right to know.
marry?
of course, we're engaged. Didn't he tell you?
how can you be engaged to someone you don't even know?
it was an arrangement between Victor and my mother.
that's absurd. You can't be expected to honor an arrangement of that sort.
my mother and I were entirely dependent upon Victor.
we'd have starved without him.
now, perhaps, you understand.
I understand you're confusing gratitude with affection.
you have no right to speak to me like that. How dare you!
I'm sorry. It's entirely your own affair and nothing to do with me.
I still think you should leave. Believe me, it's for your own good.
really, Paul, I can't imagine why you make this idiotic request.
it is not a request.
it's a demand. You must not stay here.
perhaps we should let Victor decide that. After all, it is his house.
or had you forgotten?
no, I haven't forgotten.
I'm sorry. Perhaps I shouldn't have spoken to you like this.
I'm sorry, too.
I lost my temper. Please, forgive me.
really, Paul...
...just because it was arranged years ago...
...that's no reason for my not marrying Victor.
it has always been my dearest wish.
his, too.
Victor...
how many times have I told you? - Baron, then.
Herr Baron. - That's better.
how much longer is this to go on?
meeting like this in dark corridors. Making love in secret.
when are you going to marry me?
what makes you so sure that I'll marry you?
because you promised. And because of this.
Herr Baron Victor...
...this woman...
...what is she doing here?
are you jealous? - No.
Yes.
Yes, I am jealous.
she's not your mistress?
if I thought she was... - On the contrary, Justine.
she's to be your mistress.
it will be your duty to serve my cousin Elizabeth.
and see to her every need as thoroughly as you have mine in a different way of course. - Of course.
Victor, you're not going away again, are you?
I'm afraid I must. I'll be back tomorrow evening.
why, Elizabeth...
...What's the matter?
I'm disappointed. I see so little of you these days.
and there are the household accounts. You should check them with me.
they'll soon be your department, and I'm sure you'll handle them well.
but I'd like you to see them. I'd like your assistance with them.
soon you'll be asking to help me with my experiments.
but I would. I'd like that more than anything in the world.
who knows, my dear, perhaps you will.
one day.
I have to go. I have some materials to buy.
materials for my work.
well?
here you are, sir. - Careful, man.
not often we get them perfect in here, sir.
eyes are generally the first to go.
what do you think, sir?
they'll do.
ten we said, didn't we?
each. - The pair.
the pair. Just like you said.
who is it? - Paul.
I'm just coming.
come in, Paul.
you wanted to see me?
it's been a long time since you've been up here. Why is that?
you know you're always welcome. - I told you I would not help you.
in that case, why do you continue to live here?
of course, it's Elizabeth you're worried about, isn't it?
what is it you want?
haven't you found it difficult keeping away just guessing what I was doing?
never knowing how well I was getting on?
I've decided to let you see my progress.
then you can judge for yourself whether I shall succeed or not.
I'm at the last stage but one, come and see.
what do you think? - It's horrible!
Paul, the features are not important.
what matters is I'm creating a being that will live and breathe.
once the scars on the face heal, it won't look so bad.
Victor, I appeal to you.
stop what you're doing before it's too late.
what am I doing?
I'm harming nobody.
just robbing a few graves. What doctor or scientist doesn't?
how else can we learn the complexities of the human animal?
doctors rob for the eventual good of mankind.
this can never end in anything but evil.
why do you say that?
I admit he isn't a particularly good-looking specimen at present.
one's facial character is built up by what lies behind it in the brain.
a benevolent mind, and the face assumes the patterns of benevolence.
an evil mind, then an evil face. For this...
...the brain of a genius will be used.
when that brain starts to function within the frame...
...then the face and features will assume wisdom and understanding.
I told you I was at the last stage but one: The brain.
a brain of superior intellect.
a lifetime of knowledge already behind it.
imagine that.
my creature will be born with a lifetime of knowledge.
where is this brain to come from?
I'll get it.
now, Professor.
your hospitality is too generous, my dear Baron.
on the contrary, Professor Bernstein, it is we who are in your debt.
when Victor told me you could come, I was overjoyed.
you honor me, Miss Elizabeth.
not only overjoyed because you were to stay with us, but because...
...your presence at dinner tonight would ensure my Victor's presence.
Elizabeth thinks I spend too much time in my laboratory.
he's locked in there for hours, Professor. He doesn't eat and he doesn't sleep.
I, for one, think the world would be a far better place without research.
at least, my world would be.
she may be right, Baron.
one can spend too much of one's life locked in stuffy rooms...
...seeking out obscure truths.
searching, researching...
...until one is too old to enjoy life.
Victor, the Professor is on my side.
you've failed me, Professor.
Elizabeth will be quoting you when she wants me to leave my work...
...and idle away the time with her.
indeed, you shall.
I'll say, "Victor, you are only a little scientist. I shan't listen to you.
on the authority of the greatest brain in Europe, leave your laboratory...
...and come out into the sunshine with me.
women, Professor. How cleverly they twist our words to suit their own ends.
she'll only be happy if I give up my work entirely.
is the world ready for the revelation you scientists make?
there's a great difference between knowing a thing is so and knowing how to use that knowledge for the good of mankind.
the trouble with us scientists is...
...we quickly tire of our discoveries.
we hand them over to people who are not ready for them...
...while we go off again into the darkness of ignorance...
...searching for other discoveries...
...which will be mishandled in the same way when the time comes.
it's not as bad as that, surely.
would you have us give up research, too?
good evening.
Paul, I'm so glad you arrived in time to meet Professor Bernstein.
professor Bernstein?
Yes, indeed. May I introduce my friend Paul Krempe.
good evening, sir. - How do you do?
the Professor is staying with us tonight.
I'm proud to meet you. I had no idea such an honor awaited my return.
we didn't expect you until the morning.
I thought it best to come back.
I've heard a great deal about you from Baron Frankenstein.
I look forward to a talk with you in the morning.
I shall be delighted.
we've exhausted the Professor. - No, no.
I have enjoyed every minute of this delightful evening.
but old age comes not alone.
good night, young lady.
good night, Professor. I trust that you will sleep well.
good night, sir. - Good night.
I'll show you to your room. - Thank you.
I really am most honored to have you here, sir.
I'm most grateful to you, my boy.
you know, I'm alone in the world.
and to be guest in someone's home, especially...
...such a charming home like this with such a wonderful atmosphere...
...It's very precious to me.
you are too kind, sir.
I'd like to show you a painting just before you retire.
it's this one at the top of the staircase.
it was purchased by my father and illustrates one of the early operations.
if you step back a little, you'll see it better.
look out, Professor! Look out!
Baron Frankenstein...
...I'm sure I'm expressing the feelings of all of us...
...when I say how much we appreciate your kindness and consideration in allowing the body of our poor colleague...
...to find its last resting place in your family vault.
as you know, Professor Bernstein had no living relatives.
it was the least I could do. He was a guest in my house.
I thought I'd find you here.
that was very intelligent of you.
now that you've found me, what do you want?
you killed the old man, didn't you?
and now you're mutilating his body.
Mutilating? I've removed his brain. Mutilating has nothing to do with it.
I can't prove you murdered him, but I can stop you using his brain.
Why? He has no further use for it.
give me that! - Don't be a fool! Be careful!
you'll damage it!
get away from here, leave me alone! Get out of here!
if you've damaged it...
who is it?
what's the matter, Paul?
I've come to appeal to you to leave here.
what are you talking about? Leave here? - Now.
this very minute. Before it's too late.
Paul, we've been through all this before.
won't you understand you're in real danger?
what Victor is doing is dangerous to everyone.
then why do you stay here? You're not helping him any longer.
I'll tell you why I stay here.
I will not leave you alone in this house with him.
believe me, Paul. You're wrong about him.
am I?
you must be. - How do you know?
have you ever been in that laboratory of his? No.
you cannot possibly conceive the dreadful thing he's proposing to do.
what are you trying to tell me? That Victor is wicked, insane?
neither wicked nor insane.
just so dedicated to his work...
...he can't see the terrible consequences that could result.
Elizabeth...
...I can't bear the thought of any harm to you.
I'd do anything to avoid hurt to you both, but...
...Victor is so wrapped up in his experiments...
Paul, please.
please, leave me.
I want you to help me.
you must be mad.
that apparatus was constructed for dual operation. You know that.
I thought I could work it myself, but I can't.
I'm delighted.
that means your experiment will not succeed.
you're going to help me, Paul, whatever you say.
if you help me, once I've proved my theories, I'll dispose of this creature.
how long will that take? - A month, two at the outside.
and have that thing alive up there? No!
if you don't help me, Paul, then I make no such promise.
somehow, I'll manage on my own.
however difficult, I'll do it.
and when I have succeeded...
...I'll introduce Elizabeth to science and see how she likes it.
there is nothing more important to me than the success of this experiment.
it's what I've worked for all my life.
all right, Victor.
I'll help you.
Victor!
I did it, Paul.
this thing must be destroyed before it regains consciousness.
do you hear me, Victor?
what did you say? - You must destroy this thing now.
don't you see? I've succeeded!
Yes, nearly succeeded in getting yourself killed.
another 10 seconds and you... - This is my creation.
Yes, a criminal lunatic. It tried to kill you...
that's the brain. When you attacked me, it was damaged.
that makes it your fault, Paul.
your fault that it is not what I intended it to be.
I can repair the brain.
it's what I've done that counts. I've created a being.
you promised to destroy it. - When I've carried out my research.
don't you see you've created a monster? - That doesn't matter.
I shall operate on the brain tomorrow. It shouldn't take long.
very well, Victor. Goodbye.
Paul! Paul!
Paul, he's gone! - He's what?
I've searched the house. Heaven knows where he's got to.
it's true, Paul, we must get out and find him!
I'll go to the village for help. - No, I'll send word.
we must pick up his trail.
if he gets into the woods, we'll never find him.
I'll meet you downstairs.
hold on, boy. You're going too fast for your old grandpa.
you sit here then, Grandpa.
where? - Here.
I'll go on now. It's not far.
aye, thank you, boy.
do be careful, now. Go on. - Yes, Grandpa.
that was quick. You can't have picked many.
what's the matter? Can't you find your way?
I'm here, son.
I've lost my stick. Help me find it, son.
you're quiet. Cat got your tongue?
who are you?
tell me who you are.
what do you want with me? Can't you see I'm only a poor blind man?
I've got nothing for you.
I can't harm you.
somebody help me! Help me!
grandpa!
grandpa!
look, he must have stopped here.
where did you tell the villagers to make for?
the south lakeshore. I said we'd meet them there in half an hour.
well, his trail is easy to follow anyway.
no, Paul!
you shoot well. - I've done what had to be done.
we'll bury him before the villagers arrive. - They won't arrive.
I didn't send the message.
you madman!
you risked just two of us against that?
we might've been killed! - We might. But we weren't.
now he's dead, so it doesn't matter.
well, it's done and I hope you're satisfied.
I'm satisfied we were in time to stop this monstrous act before it was too late.
if that's what you mean.
I don't think I shall ever forgive you for what you've done. Ever.
who's there? - It's me. Paul.
just a minute.
well? - I'm leaving now.
I shall send for my things in a few days. - As you wish, Paul.
where are you going? What will you do? - I have no idea.
it is no longer necessary for me to remain here.
what do you mean "necessary"?
of course, there's Elizabeth. You stayed to protect her.
you've done what you set out to do. You can leave with a clear conscience.
I'll give you life again.
Justine, you can serve dinner. - Just a minute.
is it true?
I beg you pardon?
about you marrying that woman?
aren't you forgetting yourself? - You promised to marry me.
I'm not forgetting that.
so I did. - Don't you laugh at me.
stop it! Stop it or l... - What?
what will you do? - I'll kill you.
you stupid little fool!
did you really think I'd marry you? - You're hurting!
get back to your work!
but you've got to marry me. You've got to.
I'm going to have a child.
since when is this? - It doesn't matter.
it's true, that's all.
why choose me as the father? Pick any man in the village.
the chances are it'll be the right one.
she won't think so. Not when I tell her.
I'll tell her about what you're doing in that laboratory of yours.
and then I'll go to the authorities and tell them.
tell them what?
I know plenty, if I care to tell.
what do you know? - You wouldn't like that, would you?
well, if you don't marry me, I'll tell.
tell what?
you know what I'm talking about.
proof, my dear. That's all the authorities would be interested in.
proof.
I want you out by tomorrow morning. - I'll get proof.
just you see. I'll get it.
pass the marmalade, will you, Miss Elizabeth?
thank you.
Victor?
I'm worried about Justine.
it's a week since she went away, and we still have no word from her.
I told you not to worry.
I expect some village lothario eloped with her.
she always was a romantic little thing.
how are the wedding invitations coming along?
had any replies yet? - Yes, quite a few.
Victor. - Yes, my sweet?
I've invited Paul to the wedding. After all, he was your good friend.
I'm sorry if I've done wrongly.
he hasn't accepted yet, so...
...maybe he won't come.
I hope he does come.
there's something I'd like him to see.
to the bride and bridegroom.
to the happy couple.
to the bridesmaids.
what are you gibbering about? - I was just rehearsing my speech, my dear.
that's not until tomorrow, after the wedding.
Yes, I know, my dear, but these things take time.
come on. We're going home.
so soon?
come on.
thank heavens they're gone. I have work to do upstairs.
but this is our wedding eve. I thought...
Oh, come, Elizabeth. We are not sentimental young lovers.
can I come and watch you working in your laboratory?
no, my dear. Not yet. But one day very soon.
I promise you.
it's a pity Paul didn't come.
leave those for the morning, Ellen.
Yes, Miss Elizabeth.
good evening. I'm Herr Krempe.
are the Baron and Miss Elizabeth at home?
Yes. - Paul!
Paul, how marvelous to see you! - Elizabeth!
we thought you weren't coming. - You look wonderful!
and Victor? - He is in his laboratory.
he's been almost living there for the past few weeks.
what's he doing? - As if I should know.
I'll never know what goes on behind that locked laboratory door.
of course, I forgot.
he'll be pleased to see you, because he said yesterday...
...that he wished you were here because he has something he wants you to see.
has he? - Why don't you go and surprise him?
I will.
who's there? - Paul.
Paul?
Paul.
still keeping the door locked. Is that necessary?
you can judge for yourself in a moment.
Elizabeth said you had something to show me.
Yes.
Yes, Paul, I have.
I've started on brain surgery, Paul.
nothing to say?
so it wasn't killed. - Oh, it was.
at least, life had passed from its body. But don't forget...
...I put it there in the first place. It was easy to restore.
wait, Paul. I want to show you something else.
I've seen enough. - Wait, Paul!
watch this.
get up!
come on, get up!
that's right.
now come here.
come on now.
come here!
sit.
sit down.
sit down!
is this your creature of superior intellect?
your perfect physical being, this animal!
ask it a question of advanced physics.
it's got a brain with a lifetime of knowledge, it should find it simple.
shall I tell you something, Paul?
there you see the result of your handiwork as much as mine.
Oh, yes. I gave him life. I put a brain in his head.
I chose a good brain, a brilliant one.
but you damaged it. You put a bullet in the wretched thing.
this is your fault, Paul. Do you understand that?
your fault.
Yes, I understand.
but you won't win, Paul. Shall I tell you why you won't win?
because I shall carry on.
if I can't cure it by brain surgery, then I'll get another brain.
and another. And another.
no. No, you will not.
Paul, what are you going to do?
Paul, what are you going to do?
for your sake, and to protect Elizabeth, I've so far kept silent.
now I shall go to the authorities and have them destroy that creature.
and see that you pay for these atrocities. - No!
Paul, where are you going?
Paul, wait a minute! What are you going to gain by this?
you're as much a part of it as I. - I've had nothing to do with it for months.
I've got something to say.
who's there?
I warn you: If you tell the authorities, Elizabeth will be the first to suffer.
Victor! On the roof.
we must go up there. - Not this time, I'm going for help.
Elizabeth! Come back!
get back! Get back!
No! No!
get away from me!
my life's work destroyed.
destroyed in a moment.
by the same hand that gave it life.
within half an hour there was nothing left of him.
and that is my story. That is what happened.
you don't believe me, do you?
you must believe me. Do you hear?
a visitor for you, Frankenstein: Herr Krempe. Will you see him?
Oh, yes! I knew Paul wouldn't fail me.
he'll tell you it's true. He knows.
he'll tell you it's true!
all right, he'll see you.
I knew Paul wouldn't fail me. He's been a good friend.
he'll prove everything I said is true. He knows.
my dear friend, Paul!
Paul!
Paul, my friend, tell them, Paul.
tell them what, Victor? - About him. About the creature I made.
tell them. You were the only person to see him apart from myself and Justine.
the girl you murdered.
but I didn't. That's what I've been saying. It was him.
he did it. - Who?
who did it, Victor? - The creature I made.
you know. The man. Tell them.
Oh, no! No, Paul!
Paul, you must tell them.
you know what's going to happen. Only you can save me.
you must tell them.
Paul, I'll make you! I'll make you!
Paul, you must tell them! Paul!
you must tell them. Paul!
I'm sorry, Paul, but you must tell them.
you must save me, Paul.
you've got to save me!
No!
Paul!
there is nothing we can do for him now.
come on, I'll take you home.

after you pushed that thing about back Thousands,..
they went on to the next name of list of the best.
but really they have to wish very much to see this made girl bits...
because the new executor, is a monster.
and it is not only one.
it is a team of husband and woman.
they love to kill as much as it is they who love each other.

?Revisaste quite? - This way it is.

I am here for a motive.
I was already imagining it.
your client has an executor to the watching.
zDe edges?
we are already not children, Chance, we are adult.
I do not walk with jueguitos, I am a professional.

thousands, you know what I do.
this is serious. The people will come to Bangkok, perhaps even be already to here,...
to kill your singer.
and they will kill you or to anyone that interfere with his work.
thousands, I am one of the best and I say to you that is an easy target.
nobody can avoid it.
if you get into the way, also they eliminate you.
I know it because it went to me to first whom they hired.
zY? does zSe suppose that I am scared?
zPor what do you you appear after all these years saying these things?
do not misinterpret me, the fear does not have nothing to see with this.
of equal form that you surprised in I roof,...
to her also they can surprise her.
it is better that you analyze better, little brother.
in the roof it was you who were the astonished one.
and so that you know it: I am one of the best.
and if the people come, it will be better that they come with all,...
because I have a gift and it would be would have used also with you.
thousands, if I had accepted this one contract, you might not have detained me.
and if you had accepted the contract, I would have extracted you of here stiffly.

siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, drew a circle with a piece of red chalk and said:
when men, even unknowingly, are to meet one day, whatever may befall each, whatever their diverging paths, on the said day, they will inevitably come together in the red circle. "
a red light. Tough!
good news: You get out tomorrow.
thanks for the tip-off, boss. - That's not all.
time's short. The watch is due.
what's the game, boss?
I've known you five years. You're the only man for this job.
job?
classic. Easy. No risk.
if done right.
and if not?
sorry. I'm not coming back here. - Well, I want out of here.
when you hear the details, you'll warm up.
I doubt it.
what's with you, Corey?
with your pedigree and your time inside, who'd offer you decent work?
bastards.
they're ahead of schedule.
leave nothing to chance, boss.
that's why I fixed the lock so no one knows I'm in here.
I'm offering you the job because I can't take risks.
you can't foresee them all.
let's hear it anyway.
my brother-in-law's worked for a firm for 15 years.
they've just installed a new security system.
one billfold.
three hundred francs.
three photos.
one driver's license.
one passport. - Expired.
one watch, platinum.
one set of keys, and that's it.
Corey.
your photos.
the telephone, please.
police here. Get me the gendarmerie.
have a map of the area? - Behind you.
where are we? - Mersault-L'Hopital.
this road? - D23.
this is Inspector Mattei, Criminal Investigations, Paris.
the prisoner I was escorting got away.
right. Set up roadblocks on all roads between Arnay-le-Duc, Nuits-St-Georges, Beaune,
Chalon-sur-Saone, Le Creusot, Autun.
I'm at the level crossing at Mersault.
right, on the D23. What?
then tell your captain to come down. I'll explain.
one other thing.
ask the prefect to put the Rex Plan into effect, and use dogs for the dragnet.
I'll wait here. And make it snappy.
what do I do?
there are other trains running.
bring me my coat and jacket, the handcuffs and the two hats, and get the train moving.
if anyone had told me you'd be my wake-up call...
I was released early.
for good behavior.
just a little poker game.
so I see.
if I haven't been in touch for the past four years...
five. - Sorry, five...
it's because during the investigation and trial, you didn't mention my name.
so I figured it was better, for you and for me...
you don't say.
don't believe me?
now that you're out, you can count on me.
it's 7: 30. The banks open at 9: 00.
I'll write you a check. - No checks.
loan me a few thousand. I'll pay you back.
you're nuts. Wait till 9: 00.
let me give you something sizeable. I owe you.
just lend me what I need.
I don't have enough cash here. Wait till 9: 00.
and in here?
nothing. Just a few thousand.
that'll do.
as you like.
I'll pay you back.
sure you will.
what is it? - Nothing.
Hello, Paul?
we're closed, mister.
ripping off Rico at home.
you lost your manners in prison.
give it back, Corey.
sure.
I lost, anyway.
Hello, police?
Nicephore NIEPCE INVENTED PHOTOGRAPHY IN THIS VILLAGE IN 1822
papers, please.
you just bought the car?
at 9: 00 this morning, before leaving Marseille.
register it in your name before next week.
your address still the same?
Yes, 19 Avenue Paul Doumer.
would you open your trunk, please?
fine, thank you.
go on.
still nothing? - We lost his trail at the stream.
we've got to find it again.
comb every inch of the region.
are they still searching? - Yes.
but I think it's useless.
the interior minister won't put up roadblocks all over France.
this isn't a terrorist.
think he'll slip through?
he'll manage.
what makes you say that?
hunter's instinct, maybe.
and for once the prey is intelligent.
the chief wants to see you.
you don't say.
as soon as you get in.
Really?
good day, sir. Registration, please.
it's not in your name.
I know. Your colleague warned me. I'll see to it tomorrow.
open your trunk, please.
they forgot to give me the key.
I can't open all my crates!
expect me to dismantle the doors, too?
why not the wheels, the tires, and the toolbox, too?
you're out of your mind!
you're free to go, sir.
come out. The coast is clear.
hands up.
fine way to thank me. - You see me climb in?
sure. Or I wouldn't suggest you get some air.
why run a risk like that?
up!
answer my question.
after I lower my hands.
and rich, to boot.
put your hands down.
this morning?
that's unbelievable.
What'd you think seeing me hide in your car?
that you're the fugitive the radio mentioned.
I'd just passed a roadblock at Chalon.
and you weren't afraid?
what of?
me, to start with.
and of them finding me in your trunk, for instance.
come on. Paris is your best bet.
in case we don't meet again, thanks.
Hello, Fiorello.
Hello, you.
Hello, Grifollet.
time to eat.
come on, children.
you're sulking because I was away for three days.
come on, Grifollet.
take the forest road.
get out on my side.
end of the line, Corey.
one move and you're dead. Hands up.
let's go, quick. Someone might've heard the shots.
only chance can help now. - Chance hasn't had much luck.
Mr. Mattei, didn't you know that a suspect must be considered guilty?
not for me, sir.
I've dealt with so many suspects who were innocent...
you must be joking! No one is innocent.
all men are guilty.
they're born innocent, but it doesn't last.
sir, my chief just told you that only chance can catch Vogel now.
chance and myself, actually.
Mr. Mattei, I don't doubt your goodwill, but allow me to doubt your efficiency in arresting culprits.
Mattei has the finest service record in 15 years on the force.
so what? People change in 15 years.
you think I'm the man I was in 1955?
we all change for the worse.
I'm ready to resign if
that would be too easy.
no, you're to find Vogel by hook or by crook.
no matter what the cost.
you know him the best here.
traveling together in a sleeping car creates a bond, even if the journey's cut short.
very well. I'll find him.
I'm sure he will.
I hope so for both your sakes, since you vouch for your subordinate, my dear director.
indeed. I'll vouch for him.
and don't forget: all guilty.
even policemen? - All men, Mr. Mattei.
INTERNALAFFAIRS DIVISION - Was he kidding? - He meant it.
it's his doctrine: Crime lurks within us. We have to flush it out.
strange man.
a man to be feared.
where will you start?
the usual channels.
did you hear? - I did, sir.
but why the name " Mattei " ?
blond hair, blue eyes.
that's not very Corsican.
bring me his file, will you?
along with his concierge's reports and the list of his informers.
I can't imagine him as an informer. - That's because he isn't.
it's not the barmaid? - It is.
it's hard to find a guy on the lam if he's smart.
Yes, I know.
just find a way to bait him.
I don't even know the guy. What's he bite at?
spoons, flies, worms, maggots?
is the fish you're after pike or perch?
spare me the fishing lesson.
you've got lots of imagination.
the neighborhood's changed.
hoods use new tactics since the open-air market moved.
the neighborhood's dead.
change neighborhoods. - People know me.
do as I do: Work through others.
sure.
but tell me one thing.
you sure he's guilty?
I am.
so, Santi, forgetting our old friends, are we?
why come to my club, Inspector?
so that everyone sees you and thinks I'm a snitch?
you really want to burn me.
don't lay it on so thick. Not at all.
just say you had some problems with the police over some call girls.
if you won't help me, I have to try scaring you.
you've tried before to no avail.
think so? Don't believe it.
I've nothing to say.
with this clientele?
I don't know what's said here, and even if I did
you wouldn't tell me. I know.
I'm warning you, Santi.
I hushed up your little affair... for the time being.
don't make me regret it.
you slipped up. I have to use it.
even if it's against your nature, you have to help me.
if not, I promise you you'll be in deep water.
all police have informers.
you know that.
you read the papers, listen to radio, watch television.
find me Vogel.
is that all! I don't even know him.
and this?
he a look-alike?
so you'll hear about him.
after this visit, I doubt it.
I repeat, tell them it concerns your affair.
if you like, I can help out.
I can have you hauled in for 48 hours.
that way your honor remains intact.
Vogel never dealt with the mob. - But he will now.
to lay low, he'll ask for help.
you'll hear about it. And so will I.
see you tomorrow.
where to?
you, wherever you like. Me, I'm going to bed.
I've been dying to for 48 hours.
I know.
a job coming from a prison guard sounds dubious.
but we can start by checking it out.
that'll prove nothing.
but it'll be something to go by.
okay. Let's say we decide to go ahead with the job.
we still need a marksman.
that's why I'm talking to you.
me? Get it out of your head.
between shooting two men six feet away and hitting a target at 100 feet, there's a certain difference.
it's the difference between an amateur and a professional.
and, despite appearances, I'm no professional.
I knew a really good marksman four or five years ago.
a policeman.
a crack policeman.
one of the best shots on the force.
but the corruption of his work environment finally got to him.
between my prison guard and your cop, aren't we overdoing it?
go see him.
we'll take that risk. Talk to him.
I remember his number.
he may not have moved.
mister Jansen?
speaking.
excuse me. I was in the shower.
who's this?
you don't know me.
a friend of a friend. Can we meet?
Yes. Of course.
when and where?
I don't know.
around midnight?
sure. Where?
fine.
they killed each other over a few thousand francs.
if we find out whose money it is, we'd make sense of the killings.
we'd also have to track down the other car.
if its driver has anything to do with the money, we'd have a better fix.
think there's a connection with Vogel?
I don't know.
he escapes in the morning between Marseille and Paris, and the next day two guys are found dead on the same route.
well? - The tire casts of the second car.
two makes of tire, three levels of wear.
the car's not new. Probably a '66 or a '67 model.
what make? - Ford, Chevrolet, Plymouth?
anyone asks for me, my name is Corey. I'll be over there.
car REGISTRATION
this friend wants to keep a low profile.
I want you to meet him to discuss a job.
two whiskeys.
no, thanks. I never touch it.
a double.
you're real scum.
insulting an officer in the exercise of his duties.
don't make things worse.
you know this arrest's for show, for your customers and staff, just to make things easy for you.
just sit back.
it's like this, Santi.
as I said last night, I don't want to bring you down.
and I'm not changing my plan.
if I have to, I'll haul you in every week for two days of questioning.
inform your lawyer, even though I can prevent you.
and phone your bartender to bring your meals here.
everyone at the club will know, and my visit won't hurt your reputation.
you said even if I haven't an informer's nature, you'd force me to help you.
you've got your psychology all wrong.
nothing can change a man's basic nature.
I'm not calling my lawyer or my bartender.
I'm not an informer.
put him on ice.
he just pulled the classic opening routine.
'he is not and never will be an informer. "
anything on Vogel? - Nothing.
I'll speak to Santi again before releasing him.
they know each other well.
if we don't get Vogel in a day or two,
Santi will hear about him.
that's when I make my move.
and his phone? - Round-the-clock wiretap.
no introductions needed.
how are you?
and you?
you haven't heard?
I'm a wanted man. Escaping arrest.
wanted by who? - Mattei. A classmate of yours.
lot of good that'll do you.
five people will be in on this.
the three of us, the one who put us on to it, and the fence.
only one fence can handle this kind of merchandise.
he has to agree first.
Vogel has to lie low, so I'll go see him.
and someone has to case the premises.
that person will be you.
mauboussin JEWELERS
your bracelets, please.
of course, sir. This way, please.
what sort did you have in mind?
we have emeralds.
this piece is quite lovely.
or perhaps sapphires.
this is a recent design.
very nice.
watches.
that one.
we also make this kind of bracelet with rubies.
I think a bracelet would be best...
for a very young woman.
I must think it over.
at your service, sir.
it all checks out as you said.
the bulletproof glass showcases double as safes.
no need to remove and put back the hundreds of different pieces.
the showcases are opened and closed electronically.
the wall key does exist.
it controls the showcases and the electric eyes that block access to the showroom from the landing.
there's no way in other than the way you'll use.
but beware:
there are surveillance cameras, too.
it'll be about 20 million, market value.
unset, recut, with the platinum melted, stones and gems are worth only 25%to me.
don't expect more than five million.
how long?
leave me the goods for 24 hours, and I'll pay the next day.
if you can find a better offer...
there are few of you.
true enough.
well?
I'll phone and come by. - No, come without phoning.
it's better that way.
anyway, I imagine
I'll read about the merchandise in the papers.
probably. - Precisely.
if I'd known about his release, he wouldn't have hit me at home.
and three of my boys would still be alive.
I didn't realize there was trouble.
otherwise, I wouldn't have...
what's on your mind?
nothing.
let's hear it.
let's hear it!
that's it.
Plouvier.
they're not much for talk.
a lot of good this does me.

the BURGLARS' NAMES IN THE NEXT LETTER
if the follow-up comes, we may discover the author, thanks to both.
it's happened before.
Paris postmark. - File it with the letter.
it's too big for me.
too hot.
I won't find a buyer for such merchandise.
I'd have to wait months to show it in any European market.
no one will touch it.
Thanks. You just did me a big favor.
I won't forget this.
Corey won't forget this either.
he won't have the time to remember.
we have to talk to Santi fast.
no, he has the police on his back.
he's got plenty of contacts, and he's legit.
true. And I've never seen him make a false move.
all right. If you two say so.
my friend has to know quick if you can handle his affair.
his name is Corey.
tell him to be at your place at 1: 00 a. m.
and wait in the back booth.
isn't it better at his place?
not for the first contact.
he'll be there.
you bet we have the evidence and your two friends...
come off it. Nothing happens in my school.
your father's coming.
he'll be delighted to learn his son's involved in...
I'm involved in nothing. You're just wasting your time.
maybe not.
he's here, Chief. He's coming up.
you, at last.
sorry to disappoint you. I'm not here for you.
not at all. - What then?
nothing. It's my son.
what did he do?
come into my office.
so, what's the problem?
my son Jean-Marc. He's 16.
he and two classmates were picked up today.
what for?
marijuana dealing. But I know Jean-Marc.
I make sure he stays in line.
Oh, sorry -- - Come in.
ask Narcotics about the business with the Santi boy.
don't go thinking
did I ask you for anything? Did I promise anything?
anyway, if he's mixed up in this marijuana business...
that's it! I get it now!
this is what you meant the night after Vogel's escape.
cut the playacting.
well?
sir!
Hello, Doctor? Emergency in Office 67.
attempted suicide.
two tubes of aspirin he found in a drawer.
what happened?
I tried to scare him a bit.
then I promised that if he told us who smoked in his class, we'd let him go.
And? - He told me.
this was none of your business!
this was all done for the father.
why go overboard?
sir, I was just trying to give you a hand.
now the case goes to the Juvenile Squad.
just get him to the hospital quick.
if anything happens to him, I promise you a " promotion " !
I just told him.
this should simplify matters, in fact.
I dream up this charade, and it turns out to be true.
these kids...
'they're born innocent, but it doesn't last. "
your boy's in over his head.
only you can help him now.
you see how?
will he be here all night?
what was the bullet made of?
lead, antimony and tin.
a light, soft, low-density alloy.
how did you get the right mix?
it depends on the trajectory.
in this case, 65 feet, 5l100 of a second.
the time it takes for partial fusion and cooling, before it flattens against the lock.
the little tumblers.
it sort of molds them.
understand?
no, but it's brilliant.
I studied ballistics 20 years ago with Marchand, who's now Chief Inspector of Internal Affairs. IAD.
what's that?
the police who investigate the police.
one other thing.
I don't want my cut.
you and Vogel can split it. You'll need it more.
I still don't understand.
I'll stick with you, until you're both in the clear.
and I'll see Santi's fence with you.
make sure all goes well.
why join us, then? It was thanks to you
thanks to you, I locked the beasts away.
beasts?
too long to explain.
I'll pick you up in an hour.
Hello, Fiorello.
you dozing?
time to eat.
come on, children.
Where's Grifollet?
here you are.
did Santi fill you in?
on everything.
think you can handle it?
I think so.
if I can see them, and if you're not in a hurry.
what do you mean by " not in a hurry " ?
an affair this big has to be done in stages.
don't let anyone say otherwise.
above a certain sum...
how long?
between receipt of the merchandise and the first payment, not long.
but count on a week before the second payment.
a week?
I know, but it's the best I can do.
and the first payment?
twenty-four hours after you deliver the merchandise.
Santi will be around to vouch for me.
where do I deliver? - To my home in Louveciennes.
I'll draw you a map.
I had a good impression. It seems aboveboard.
Santi there?
and Jansen?
I'm picking him up. He's coming along.
so am I. - Don't be a fool.
wait here till I get back.
tomorrow we clear out.
jansen, too? - He's staying. He's not worried.
to each his own.
I'm off. See you later.
take it easy.
we've seen worse.
wait here.
he's here.
come this way.
Corey, take the bag and run for it.
take the bag and run for it!
I'm right behind you.
why not tell him who I am?
he wouldn't have left otherwise.
you!
so...
stupid as ever on the force, eh?
all men, Mr. Mattei.
there was a boy
a very strange enchanted boy
they say he wandered very far
very far
over land and sea
don't be fooled! Evil!
a little shy
turn away from this village of sin!
and sad of eye
but very wise was he
and then one day
a magic day he passed my way
and while we spoke of many things
fools and kings
this he said to me
the greatest thing
you'll ever learn
is just to love
and be loved in return
the Moulin Rouge.
a nightclub a dance hall and a bordello ruled over by Harold Zidler.
a kingdom of nighttime pleasures where the rich played with the young and beautiful creatures of the underworld.
the most beautiful of all these was the woman who I loved.
Satine.
a courtesan, she sold her love to men.
they called her "The Sparkling Diamond."
and she was the star of the Moulin Rouge.
the woman I loved is dead.
I first came to Paris one year ago.
it was 1899, the Summer of Love.
I knew nothing of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler or Satine.
the world had been swept up in a Bohemian revolution, and I had come to be a part of it.
on the hill near Paris was the village of Montmartre.
it was not, as my father said
a village of sin.
but the center of the Bohemian world.
musicians, painters, writers.
they were known as the Children of the Revolution.
I had come to live a penniless existence.
I had come to write about truth, beauty, freedom and that which I believed in above all things: Love.
always this ridiculous obsession with love!
there was one problem.
I'd never been in love.
just then, an unconscious Argentinean fell through my roof.
he was joined by a dwarf dressed as a nun.
how do you do?
my name is Henri Marie Raymond Toulouse-Lautrec-Montfa.
I'm terribly sorry. We were upstairs rehearsing a play.
a play. Something very modern called Spectacular, Spectacular.
it's set in Switzerland.
the unconscious Argentinean suffered from narcolepsy.
perfectly fine one moment, then unconscious the next.
how is he?
wonderful. The Argentinean is unconscious.
now the play will not be ready to present to the financier tomorrow.
I still have to finish the music.
someone else can read the part.
where on earth will we find someone to play a young, sensitive Swiss poet goatherder?
soon I was upstairs, standing in for the unconscious Argentinean.
the hills animate
with the euphonious symphonies of descant
Oh, stop! Stop that insufferable droning!
it's drowning out my words!
just stick to some decorative piano.
there were artistic differences over Audrey's lyrics.
a nun wouldn't say that about a hill.
how about, "The hills are vital intoning the descant"?
the hills quake and shake
the hills are incarnate with symphonic melodies"!
"the hills " "The hills"
the hills are alive with the sound of music "The hills are alive with the sound of music." I love it!
the hills are alive with the sound of music.
it fits perfectly!
with songs they have sung
for a thousand years
Incandiferous!
you should write the show together.
excuse me?
Toulouse's suggestion was not what Audrey wanted to hear.
goodbye!
here's to your first job in Paris.
toulouse, Zidler will never agree.
have you ever written a play before?
no.
the boy has talent!
I like him.
nothing funny. I just like talent.
the hills are alive with the sound of music.
with Christian, we can write the Bohemian revolutionary show we always dreamt of.
how will we convince Zidler?
toulouse had a plan.
Satine.
they'd dress me in a suit and say I was a famous English writer.
once Satine heard my poetry, she'd be amazed and insist that
I write Spectacular, Spectacular.
but I kept hearing my father's voice:
you'll end up wasting your life at the Moulin Rouge with a cancan dancer!
I can't write the show!
why not?
I don't know if I am a Bohemian revolutionary.
do you believe in beauty?
Yes.
freedom?
of course.
truth?
Yes.
love?
love? Love?
above all things, I believe in love.
love is like oxygen.
love is a many-splendored thing.
love lifts us up where we belong.
all you need is love!
you can't fool us!
you're the voice of the Children of the Revolution!
we can't be fooled!
to the writer of the world's first Bohemian revolutionary show!
it was the perfect plan.
I was to audition for Satine and taste my first glass of absinthe.
there was a boy
I am the green fairy.
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
freedom, beauty truth and love
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
we were off to the Moulin Rouge.
I would perform my poetry for Satine.
Harold Zidler and his infamous girls.
they called them his "Diamond Dogs.
Hey, sister, go, sister
soul sister, go, sister

Yes, we can cancan!
creole Lady Marmalade

cause it's good for your mind!
mission accomplished. We've successfully evaded Zidler.
it's her! The Sparkling Diamond.
the French are glad to
die for love
they delight in fighting duels
but someone else was to meet Satine that night.
but I prefer a man who lives
Zidler's investor.
and gives expensive jewels
the Duke.
a kiss on the hand May be quite continental
but diamonds are a girl's best friend
a kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental
on your humble flat or help you feed your pussycat
men grow cold as girls grow old
and we all lose our charms in the end
but square cut or pear-shaped these rocks don't lose their shape
diamonds are a girl's best friend
when will I meet the girl?
Tiffany's!
after her number. I've arranged a special meeting, just you and Satine.
totally alone.
Cartier!
after her number, I've arranged a private meeting.
just you and Satine. Totally alone. - Alone?
Yes, totally alone.
cause we are living In a material world
and I am a material girl
come and get me, boys.
excuse me.
black Star! Roscor!
talk to me, Harry Zidler! Tell me all about it!
there may come a time When a lass needs a lawyer
but diamonds are a girl's best friend
there may come a time when a hard-boiled employer thinks
you're awful nice
don't worry. I'll sally forth and tee things up!
is the Duke here?
Liebchen, would Daddy let you down?
terribly sorry.
where is he?
toulouse is shaking a hanky at him.
excuse me, Christian. May I borrow?
are you sure?
let me peek.
I'm ever so sorry! How embarrassing!
that's the one. I hope that demonic little loon doesn't frighten him off.
clean yourself up, you bourgeois pig!
sorry.
will he invest? - Pigeon!
after spending the night with you, how could he refuse?
what's his type? Wilting flower?
bright and bubbly?
or smoldering temptress?
I'd say smoldering temptress. We're all relying on you, gosling.
remember, a real show in a real theater, with a real audience and you'll be
a real actress.
cause that's when those louses go back to their spouses
diamonds
I have exciting news!
are a girl's best friend
I believe you were expecting me.
Yes. Yes.
I'm afraid it's lady's choice.
I see you've met my English friend
I'll take care of it.
let's dance.
hit her with your most modern poem!
to the beat of the rhythm of the night
dance until the morning light
forget the worries on your mind
you can leave them all behind
that went well.
incredible.
he has a gift with the women.
I told you. He's a genius.
that Duke certainly can dance.
how wonderful of you to take an interest in our show.
it sounds very exciting. I'd be delighted to be involved.
assuming you like what I do.
I'm sure I will.
toulouse thought we might be able to do it in private.
did he?
Yes, you know, a private poetry reading.
a "poetry reading.
I love a little "poetry" after supper.
hang on to your hat!
diamonds
diamonds
square cut or pear-shaped
these rocks won't lose their shape
diamonds are a girl's best
Satine! Satine! Satine!
I doubt the Duke will get his money's worth tonight.
don't be unkind, Nini.
you've frightened her away.
but I can see some lonely Moulin Rouge dancers looking for a partner or two! So if you can Hunk Hunk you can Hunkadola with them!
out of my way!
Oh, Marie.
Oh, these silly costumes.
just a fainting spell.
back out front, girls. Make those gents thirsty.
problems?
nothing to worry about.
don't stand around, then.
come out of the garden, baby
you'll catch your death in the fog young girls
they call them the Diamond Dogs
find Zidler. The girl's waiting for me.
that twinkle-toes Duke took the bait, girl.
a patron like him, you could be the next Sarah Bernhardt.
do you really think I could be like the great Sarah?
why not? You got the talent.
you hook that Duke and you'll be lighting the great stages of Europe.
I'll be a real actress, Marie. A great actress.
I'm gonna fly away from here. I'm gonna fly, fly away.
duckling, are you all right?
of course, Harold.
thank goodness!
you certainly weaved your magic with the Duke on the dance floor.
how do I look?
a smoldering temptress?
my little strawberry how could he possibly resist gobbling you up?
everything's going so well!
I'll meet you in the red room
unbelievable! Straight to the elephant.
this is a wonderful place for a poetry reading. Don't you think?
poetic enough for you?
a little supper? Maybe some champagne?
I'd rather just get it over and done with.
very well.
then why don't you come down here?
let's get it over and done with.
I prefer to do it standing.
you don't have to stand.
sometimes it's It's quite long and I'd like you to be comfortable.
what I do is quite modern. It may feel strange at first, but if you're open, you might enjoy it.
I'm sure I will.
excuse me.
the sky
the sky the bluebirds
come on. Come on.
I think
there might be some shaking.
is everything okay?
I'm a little nervous. Sometimes it takes a while for inspiration to come.
Oh, yes, yes.
let Mummy help.
does that inspire you?
let's make love.
you want to, don't you?
tell the truth. Can't you feel the poetry?
come on!
feel it.
free the tiger!
big boy!
he's got a huge talent!
I need your poetry now!
all right!
it's a little bit funny this feeling inside.
I'm not one of those who can easily hide.
is this okay? Is this what you want?
Oh, poetry.
this is what I want, naughty words.
naughty!
I don't have much money, but if I did, I'd buy a big house where we both could live.
Oh! It's so bad!
if I were a sculptor, then again, no.
you devil.
or a man who makes potions in a traveling show.
don't, don't, don't!
don't stop!
I know it's not much.
give me more! Yes!
it's the best I can do.
naughty! Don't stop! Yes!
my gift is my song
and this one's for you
and you can tell everybody
that this is your song
it may be quite simple, but
now that it's done
I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind
that I put down in words
how wonderful life is
now you're in the world
I sat on the roof
and I kicked off the moss
well, some of these verses
they got me quite cross
but the sun's been kind
while I wrote this song
it's for people like you that
keep it turned on
so excuse me forgetting
but these things I do
you see, I've forgotten
if they're green or they're blue
anyway, the thing is
what I really mean
yours are the sweetest eyes
I've ever seen
and you can tell everybody
this is your song
it may be quite simple, but
now that it's done
I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind
that I put down in words
how wonderful life is
now you're in the world
looks like he got the job!
I can't believe it.
I'm in love.
I'm in love with a young handsome, talented duke.
Duke?
not that the title's important, of course.
I'm not a duke.
not a duke?
I'm a writer.
a writer?
Yes, a writer.
toulouse
you're not one of Toulouse's talented,
bohemian, impoverished proteges?
you might say that. - Oh, no!
I'm going to kill him!
there might be a small hitch.
what about the Duke?
my dear Duke
the Duke!
hide! Out back!
my dear, are you decent for the Duke?
where were you?
I, uh I was waiting.
dear Duke, allow me to introduce Mademoiselle Satine!
how wonderful of you to take time out to visit.
the pleasure, I fear, will be entirely mine, my dear.
I'll leave you two squirrels to get better acquainted.
a kiss on the hand may be quite continental
but diamonds are a girl's best friend.
after tonight's pretty exertions on the stage you must be in need of refreshment.
don't! Don't you just love the view?
charming.
I feel like dancing.
I should like a glass of champagne.
it's
it's a little bit funny.
what is?
this feeling inside.
I'm not one of those who can easily hide.
I don't have much money but if I did, I'd buy a big house where we both could live.
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
that I put down in words
how wonderful life is
now you're in the world
that's very beautiful.
it's from Spectacular, Spectacular.
suddenly, with you here
I finally understood the true meaning of the words.
how wonderful life is now you're in the world.
and what meaning is that, my dear?
Duke!
don't you toy with my emotions.
you must know the effect you have on women.
let's make love!
you want to make love, don't you?
make love?
I knew you felt the same way!
Oh, Duke!
you're right. We should wait until opening night.
wait? Wait?
there's a power in you that scares me.
you should go.
I just got here.
we'll see each other every day during rehearsal.
we must wait. We must wait until opening night. Get out.
do you have any idea what would have happened if you were found?
Satine?
let's have a little peekaboo.
right on target.
I forgot my hat
foul play?
Oh, Duke.
it's a little bit funny, this feeling inside!
beautifully spoken.
let me introduce you. The writer.
the writer?
Yes.
we were rehearsing.
you expect me to believe that scantily clad in the arms of another man, inside an elephant, you were rehearsing?
how's the rehearsal going?
shall we take it from the top?
I hope the piano's in tune.
sorry, got held up.
can I offer you a drink?
Oh, my goodness!
when I spoke those words to you, you so inspired me.
I realized we had much work to do, so I called an emergency rehearsal.
then where's Zidler?
I didn't bother Harold.
dear Duke, I'm terribly sorry.
Harold! The Duke knows all about the emergency rehearsal.
emergency rehearsal?
to incorporate the Duke's artistic ideas.
Audrey will be delighted
Audrey left.
what?
cat's out of the bag.
the Duke's a big fan of our new writer's work.
that's why he's so keen to invest.
invest? Invest!
Oh, yes. Invest!
you can't blame me for hiding
christian way.
I'm way ahead of you, Zidler.
Duke, let's go to my office and peruse the paperwork.
what's the story?
if I'm to invest, I need to know the story.
well, the story's about
Toulouse?

but her kingdom's invaded by an evil maharajah.
to save her kingdom, she has to seduce the evil maharajah but on the night of the seduction, she mistakes a penniless a penniless sitar player for the maharajah and falls in love with him!
he wasn't trying to trick her.
he was dressed as a maharajah because he's appearing in a play.
I will play the penniless tango-dancing sitar player.
he will sing like an angel but dance like the devil.
Yes, all right. And what happens next?
the sitar player and the courtesan must hide their love.
the sitar player's sitar is magical.
it only speaks the truth.
and I will play the magical sitar!
you are beautiful.
you are ugly. And you

tell him about the cancan!
the Tantric cancan is an erotic, spectacular scene that captures the thrusting, vibrant wild, Bohemian spirit that the whole production embodies, Duke!

while the party raged upstairs
I tried to write.
but all I could think about was her.
how wonderful life is
was she thinking about me?
now you're in the world
Duke? I'm not a duke.
I'm a writer.
he wasn't trying to trick her
it's about love.
it's about love overcoming all obstacles.
I follow the night
can't stand the light
when will I begin to live again?
one day I'll fly away
leave all this to yesterday
what more could your love do for me?
when will love be through with me?
why live life from dream to dream?
and dread the day when dreaming ends
how wonderful life is
now you're in the world
one day I'll fly away
leave all this to yesterday
why live life from dream to dream?
and dread the day when dreaming ends
one day I'll fly away
fly fly away
sorry. I didn't mean
I saw your light on and I climbed up the
I wanted to thank you for helping me get the job.
of course.
Yes, Toulouse was right.
you're very talented.
it will be a wonderful show.
anyway, I'd better go.
we both have a big day tomorrow.
wait.
please wait.
before, when we were when we were when you thought I was the Duke you said you loved me, and I wondered
if it was just an act?
Yes.
of course.
it felt real.
christian l'm a courtesan.
I'm paid to make men believe what they want to believe.
silly of me, to think you could fall in love with someone like me.
I can't fall in love with anyone.
can't fall in love?
a life without love? That's terrible!
No! Being on the street is terrible.
love is like oxygen.
love is a many-splendored thing. Love lifts us up where we belong.
don't start that again.
all you need is love
a girl has to eat
all you need is love
or she'll end up on the streets
all you need is love
love is just a game
I was made for loving you, baby you were made for loving me
the only way of loving me, baby
is to pay a lovely fee
just one night Give me just one night
there's no way 'Cause you can't pay
in the name of love
one night in the name of love
you crazy fool
I won't give in to you
don't leave me this way
I can't survive without your sweet love
Oh, baby
don't leave me this way
you'd think that people would have had enough
of silly love songs
I look around me and I see it isn't so
Oh, no
some people want to fill the world with silly love songs
well, what's wrong with that?
I'd like to know 'Cause here I go again
love lifts us up where we belong
get down! Get down!
where eagles fly
on a mountain high
love makes us act like we are fools
throw our lives away
for one happy day
we could be heroes
just for one day
you, you will be mean
no, I won't.
and I
I'll drink all the time
we should be lovers
we can't do that
we should be lovers
and that's a fact
though nothing will keep us together
we could steal time
just for one day
we could be heroes
for ever and ever
we could be heroes
for ever and ever
we can be heroes
just because I
will always love you
I can't help loving you
how wonderful life is
now you're in the world
you're going to be bad for business, I can tell.
how wonderful life is
now you're in the world
how wonderful life was now Satine was in the world.
but in the Duke
Zidler had gotten much more than he had bargained for.
converting the Moulin Rouge into a theater will cost a fantastic sum.
so, in return, I would require a contract that binds Satine to me exclusively.
naturally, I'll require some security:
the deeds to the Moulin Rouge.
my dear Duke
please! Don't think that I'm naive, Zidler.
I shall hold the deeds. And if there are any shenanigans my manservant, Warner will deal with it in the only way you underworld show folk understand.
Satine will be mine.
it's not that I'm a jealous man.
I just don't like other people touching my things!
I understand completely Duke.
good.
now that we have an understanding, it appears that you have the means to transform your beloved Moulin Rouge - into a theater!
I shall woo Satine over supper tonight.
we will have created the world's first completely modern entirely electric, totally Bohemian all-singing, all-dancing stage spectacular!
the show must go on!
Yes, the show would go on.
but Satine would not attend supper that night or the following night.
mad with jealousy, the evil maharajah forces the courtesan to tell the sitar player she doesn't love him.
thank you for curing me of my ridiculous obsession with love
says the sitar player, throwing money at her and leaving the kingdom!
brilliant! Brilliant!
a life without love? That's terrible!
Yes. But the sitar player
wait! That's my part.
that's my part, Christian!
don't you dare!
the magic sitar, who can only speak the truth, says:
the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.
a picnic, sweet lady?
Oh, but we have so much work to do.
if the writer can carry a basket, you can both do it in my presence.
so he falls from the roof
Yes, I know, I know. Don't tell me.
the greatest thing you'll ever
still at it, my sweet?
master make contract
I've so many lines. I've been drilling them over and over.
for try as the Duke may, it was almost too easy for the writer and actress to invent reasons to avoid him.
Mademoiselle Satine,
I haven't finished the new scene.
the "Will the lovers be meeting at the sitar player's humble abode?" scene.
may I work on it with you later tonight?
but, my dear, I arranged a magnificent supper for us in the tower.
we can work on it tomorrow.
how dare you! It cannot wait until tomorrow.
"the lovers will meet at the sitar player's humble abode" scene is crucial.
we'll work tonight until I'm completely satisfied.
dear Duke, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
nice work, family!
bright and early tomorrow morning, we begin on Act Two:
the lovers are discovered.
Zidler.
my dear Duke, everything is arranged for that supper in the tower tonight.
you can eat it yourself! Her affections are waning!
impossible.
I know her work's important, but she's always at it with that writer!
if I don't see her tonight, I'm leaving!
no, Duke! I'll insist Satine take the night off.
all right.
eight o'clock, then.
you'll come tonight?
Yes.
what time?
eight o'clock.
promise?
Yes.
go.
are you mad?
the Duke holds the deeds to the Moulin Rouge.
he's spending a fortune on you.
given you a beautiful new dressing room.
he wants to make you a star.
and you're dallying with the writer.
Harold, don't be rid
I saw you together!
it's nothing.
it's just an infatuation. It's nothing.
the infatuation will end.
go to the boy.
tell him it's over.
the Duke is expecting you at 8.
if I should die
this very moment
I wouldn't fear
for I've never known completeness
like being here
wrapped in the warmth of you
loving every breath of you
why live life from dream to dream?
and dread the day
how could I know in those last fatal days that a force darker than jealousy and stronger than love had begun to take hold of Satine?
where is she?
will she be up by tonight?
tomorrow at the earliest.
the Duke's leaving!
she's confessing!
confessing? Do you take me for an imbecile, Zidler?
she suddenly had a terrible desire to go to a priest and confess her sins.
she wanted to be cleansed of her former life.
she looks upon tonight as her wedding night.
wedding night?
she's like a blushing bride.
she says you make her feel like a virgin.
virgin?
you know. Touched for the very first time.
she says it feels so good inside when you hold her and you touch her.
like a virgin.
she's made it through the wilderness somehow.
she's made it through.
she didn't know how lost she was
until she found you
she was beat incomplete
she'd been had she was sad and blue
but you made her feel
Yes, you made her feel
shiny and new
like a virgin
touched for the very first time
like a virgin
when your hearts beat both in time
gonna give you all her love
her fear is fading fast
been saving it all for you
only love can last
she's so fine and she's thine
she'll be yours till the end of time 'Cause you made her feel
Yes, you made her feel
she has nothing to hide
like a virgin
touched for the very first time
like a virgin
when your hearts beat Both in time
like a virgin
feels so good inside
when you hold her and you touch her
she's so fine and she's mine
makes me strong
Yes, she makes me bold
now her love thawed out
Yes, her love thawed out
what was scared and cold
like a virgin
touched for the very first time
like a virgin
when your hearts beat both in time
like a virgin
feels so good inside
when you hold her And you touch her
when you hold her And you touch her
like a virgin
Harold Zidler's brilliant lies had once again averted disaster.
but no lie, however brilliant, could save Satine.
Monsieur Zidler
Mademoiselle Satine is dying. She has consumption.
my little sparrow is dying?
she mustn't know, Marie.
the show must go on.
all night, the penniless sitar player had waited.
and now, for the first time he felt the cold stab of jealousy.
where were you last night?
I told you
I was sick.
you don't have to lie to me.
we have to end it.
everyone knows.
Harold knows.
sooner or later, the Duke will find out too.
on opening night, I have to sleep with the Duke.
and the jealousy will drive you mad.
christian
then I'll write a song.
we'll put it in the show and whatever happens when you hear it or sing it or hum it, it'll mean we love each other.
I won't get jealous.
things don't work that way, Christian.
we have to end it.
never knew
I could feel like this
like I've never seen the sky before want to vanish inside your kiss
this new scene is where the sitar player writes a secret song for the courtesan, so whatever happens however bad things are, they remember their love.
we could take it from your line, Satine. Let's take it from there.
we must be careful.
fear not. We will conduct our love affair under the maharajah's
seasons may change
winter to spring
honestly, amigo, this is impossible!
but I love you
until the end of time
come what may
come what may
I will love you
until my dying day
suddenly, the world
seems such a perfect place
my dear, a little frog!
suddenly it moves
with such a perfect grace
suddenly my life doesn't seem such a waste
it all revolves around you
and there's no mountain
too high
no river too wide
sing out this song and I'll be there by your side
storm clouds may gather
and stars may collide
but I love you
I love you
until the end of time
come what may
come what may
I will love you
the magical sitar falls from the roof and says:
the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.
this ending is silly.
why would the courtesan go for the penniless writer?
Whoops. I mean, sitar player.
come what may
I will love you
come what may
Yes, I will love you
come what may
I will love you
till my dying day
I don't like this ending.
don't like the ending?
why would the courtesan choose a penniless sitar player over the maharajah who is offering a lifetime of security? That's real love.
once the sitar player has satisfied his lust he will leave her with nothing.
I suggest that in the end, the courtesan choose the maharajah.
but, but Sorry.
that ending does not uphold the Bohemian ideals of truth, beauty, freedom
I don't care about your ridiculous dogma!
why shouldn't the courtesan choose the maharajah?
because she doesn't love you!
him.
him. She doesn't love she doesn't love him.
now I see.
Monsieur Zidler.
this ending will be rewritten with the courtesan choosing the maharajah and without the lovers' secret song.
it will be rehearsed in the morning, ready for the opening tomorrow night.
my dear Duke, that will be quite impossible.
Harold.
the poor Duke is being treated appallingly.
these silly writers let their imaginations run away with them.
why don't you and I have a little supper?
then afterwards we can let Monsieur Zidler know how we would prefer the story to end.
thank you, Elizabeth.
I don't want you to sleep with him.
he could destroy everything.
it's for us.
you promised.
you promised me you wouldn't be jealous.
it will be all right.
Yes, it will.
he's waiting.
come what may
come what may.
she had gone to the tower to save us all.
and for our part we could do nothing but wait.
my dear Duke.
I hope I have not kept you waiting.
don't worry, Shakespeare.
you'll get your ending.
once the Duke gets his end in.
Nini. No, no.
keep your hands off me!
never fall in love with a woman who sells herself.
it always ends bad!
the boy has a ridiculous obsession with me.
I indulge his fantasy because he's talented.
we need him but only until tomorrow night.
we have a dance in the brothels of Buenos Aires.
it tells the story of a prostitute and a man who falls in love with her.
first there is desire!
then passion!
then suspicion!
jealousy! Anger! Betrayal!
when love is for the highest bidder, there is no trust.
without trust, there is no love!
jealousy - yes, jealousy - will drive you mad!
roxanne!
you don't have to put on that red light
walk the streets for money
you don't care if it's wrong or if it's right
Roxanne
you don't have to wear that dress tonight
Roxanne
you don't have to sell your body to the night
his eyes upon your face
his hand upon your hand
his lips caress your skin
it's more than
I can stand
Roxanne
why does my heart cry
Roxanne
feelings
I can't fight
you're free to leave me
but just don't deceive me
and please believe me
when I say
I love you
when this production succeeds you will no longer be a cancan dancer but an actress.
I will make you a star.
accept it as a gift from this maharajah to his courtesan.
and
and the ending?
let Zidler keep his fairy-tale ending.
Roxanne
why does my heart cry?
Roxanne
feelings
I can't fight
you're free to leave me
but just don't deceive me
and please believe me
when I say
I love you
come what may
I will love you
till my dying day
no.
no?
I see.
it's our very own penniless sitar player.
my dear Duke
Silence!
you made me believe that you loved me!
why does my heart cry?
feelings
I can't fight
I couldn't.
I couldn't go through with it.
I saw you there, and I felt differently and I couldn't pretend.
and the Duke, he saw!
he saw and he
Christian, I love you.
it's okay.
I couldn't do it. I didn't want to pretend anymore.
I didn't want to lie. I don't.
and he knows. He knows and he
you don't have to pretend anymore. We'll leave.
we'll leave tonight.
leave?
but the show
I don't care.
I don't care about the show.
we have each other. That's all that matters.
Yes.
as long as we have each other.
we have each other.
chocolat, take Satine to her dressing room to pack. No one must see you.
I understand.
darling, you go and pack. I'll be waiting.
it's the boy.
he has bewitched her with words.
I want her back, Zidler. Find her.
tell her that the show will end my way and she will come to me when the curtain falls or I'll have the boy killed.
killed?
killed.
forgive the intrusion, cherub.
you're wasting your time.
you don't understand.
the Duke is going to kill Christian.
he is insanely jealous.
do his ending and sleep with him tomorrow night or the Duke will have Christian killed.
he can't scare us.
he's a powerful man. You know he can do it.
what are you doing?
I don't need you anymore!
you always made me believe
I was only worth what someone would pay for me!
but Christian loves me.
he loves me.
he loves me.
and that is worth everything.
we're going away from you, away from the Duke, away from the Moulin Rouge!
goodbye, Harold.
you're dying, Satine.
you're dying.
another trick?
no, my love.
the doctor told us.
Marie?
I'm dying.
I was a fool to believe
a fool to believe
it all ends today
Yes, it all ends today
send Christian away.
only you can save him.
he'll fight for me.
unless he believes you don't love him.
you're a great actress, Satine.
make him believe you don't love him.
use your talent to save him.
hurt him.
hurt him to save him.
there is no other way.
the show must go on, Satine.
we're creatures of the underworld.
we can't afford to love.
today's the day when dreaming ends
another hero another mindless crime.
behind the curtain in the pantomime.
on and on
does anybody know
what we are living for?
whatever happens
we leave it all to chance
another heartache
another failed romance
on and on
does anybody know
what we are living for?
the show must go on
the show must go on
outside, the dawn is breaking on the stage
that holds our final destiny
the show must go on
the show must go on
inside, my heart is breaking
my makeup may be flaking
but my smile still stays on
the show must go on
the show must go on
I'll top the bill I'll earn the kill
I have to find the will to carry
on with the, On with the
on with the show
on with the show!
the show must go on
what's wrong?
I'm staying with the Duke.
after I left, the Duke came to see me and he offered me everything.
everything I've ever dreamed of.
he has one condition.
I must never see you again.
I'm sorry.
what are you talking about?
you knew who I was.
what about last night?
the difference between you and I is that you can leave anytime you choose.
but this is my home.
the Moulin Rouge is my home.
there must be something else. This can't be real.
something's wrong. Tell me what it is. Tell me the truth.
tell me the truth!
the truth?
the truth is
I am the Hindi courtesan.
and I choose the maharajah.
that's how the story really ends.
jealousy has driven him mad!
Satine!
Satine!
Satine!
things aren't always as they seem.
things are exactly as they seem.
Christian, you may see me only as a drunken, vice-ridden gnome whose friends are just pimps and prostitutes.
but I know about art and love if only because I long for it with every fiber of my being.
she loves you. I know it. I know she loves you.
go away, Toulouse. Leave me alone.
go away.
go away!!
I wanted to shut out what Toulouse had said but he had filled me with doubt.
there was only one way to be sure.
I had to know.
so I returned to the Moulin Rouge one last time.
she is mine!
I only speak the truth
I only speak the truth

I know she still loves him. There must be a reason.
how about one of them is a duke and
then you agree something is wrong. But what? What?
I raise high my ceremonial wedding sword and welcome my loyal subjects to join with us in celebration
what a magnificent performance.
a little bit more for me, lovey. That's a girl.
the boy is here.
I told Satine if he came near her, he'd be killed!
he very soon will be.
he will be killed.
that's why she's pushing him away. To save him.
that's it.
Christian!
Oh, God, this is high up.
I've come to pay my bill.
you shouldn't be here, Christian.
just leave.
killed. Killed.
I must warn him!
you made me believe you loved me.
I should pay you.
she has to go on-stage!
jealousy has driven the sitar player into hiding.
you did your job very well.
persian army, go!
the boy's taken Satine.
I should pay you like everyone else does!
don't, Christian. There's no point.
just leave.
they're going to kill the poor boy!
I have found them.
stop him.
if you don't love me and it wasn't real, why can't I pay you?
let the palace doors be opened!
Christian!
open the doors!
let me pay! Let me pay!
open the doors.
tell me you don't love me!
open the doors!
Christian!
tell me you don't love me!
I am not fooled!
though he has shaved off his beard and adopts a disguise my eyes do not lie!
for it is he!
the same penniless sitar player!
driven mad by jealousy!
Oh, God, no.
she is yours now.
I've paid my whore!
I owe you nothing.
and you are nothing to me.
thank you for curing me of my ridiculous obsession with love.
I can't remember my line.
this sitar player doesn't love you.
see? He flees the kingdom!
pumpkin, it's for the best.
you know it is. The show must go on.
and now, my bride it is time for you to raise your voice to the heavens and say your wedding vows.
I've got it!
Christian!
the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return!
never knew
I could feel like this
it's like I've never seen the sky before
want to vanish inside your kiss
every day I'm loving you
more and more
listen to my heart
can you hear it sing?
come back to me
and forgive everything
seasons may change
winter to spring
I love you.
till the end of time
come what may
come what may
come what may
come what may
I will love you
I will love you

Christian, he's got a gun!
they're trying to kill you!
shut up!
he has a gun!

stand by for curtain call.
dancers, positions, please.
Satine? What's the matter?
what is it?
tell me. What's the matter?
tell me. Satine? What's the matter?
Oh, my God.
somebody get some help!
hold the curtain. Fetch the doctor.
I'm sorry, Christian.
I'm dying.
it's all right.
I'm so sorry.
no, you'll be all right.
I know you'll be all right.
I'm cold. I'm cold.
hold me.
I love you.
you've got to go on, Christian.
I can't go on without you.
you've got so much to give.
tell our story, Christian.
promise me.
promise me.
that way l'll always be with you.
there was a boy
a very strange enchanted boy
days turned into weeks.
weeks turned into months.
and then, one not so very special day
I went to my typewriter, I sat down and I wrote our story.
a story about a time a story about a place a story about the people.
but above all things a story about love.
a love that will live forever.
the end.
the greatest thing
you'll ever learn
is just to love
and be loved in return
well.
I didn't think the Mingotts would have tried it on.
parading her at the opera like that.
sitting her next to May Welland.
it's all very odd.
well, she's had such an odd life.
will they even bring her to the ball, do you suppose?
if they do, the talk will be of little else.
good evening, Mrs. Welland. Good evening, May.
Newland, you know my niece, Countess Olenska?
countess.
I hope you've told Madame Olenska.
what?
that we're engaged.
I want everybody to know.
let me announce it this evening at the ball.
if you can persuade Mama.
but why should we change what is already settled?
you can tell my cousin yourself. She remembers you.
I remember we played together. How this brings it all back to me.
I remember everybody here the same way: in knickerbockers and pantalets.
you were horrid. You kissed me once behind a door.
but it was your cousin Vandie, the one who never looked at me...
...I was in love with.
you have been away a very long time. - Centuries and centuries.
so long I'm sure I'm dead and buried and this dear old place is heaven.
it invariably happened as everything happened in those days...
...in the same way.
as usual, Mrs. Julius Beaufort appeared unaccompanied by her husband...
...just before the Jewel Song...
...and again as usual, rose at the end of the third act and disappeared.
new York then knew that a half-hour later...
...the Beauforts' annual opera ball would begin.
carriages waited at the curb for the entire performance.
it was widely known in New York, but never acknowledged...
...that Americans want to get away from amusement even more quickly...
...than they want to get to it.
the Beauforts' house was one of the few in New York that possessed a ballroom.
such a room, shuttered in darkness 364 days of the year...
...was felt to compensate for whatever was regrettable in the Beaufort past.
Regina Beaufort came from an old South Carolina family...
...but her husband, Julius, who passed for an Englishman...
...was known to have dissipated habits, a bitter tongue...
...and mysterious antecedents.
his marriage assured him a social position, but not necessarily respect.
newland Archer had not stopped at his club as young men usually did...
...but came directly to the Beauforts.
he wanted the announcement of his engagement...
...to divert gossip away from the Countess...
...and show his most ardent support for May and her whole family.
the Beaufort house had been boldly planned.
instead of squeezing through a narrow passage to get to the ballroom...
...one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladed drawing rooms.
but only by actually passing through the crimson drawing room...
...could one see The Return of Spring, the much-discussed nude by Bouguereau...
...which Beaufort had had the audacity to hang in plain sight.
good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening, Mr. Archer.
archer enjoyed such challenges to convention.
he questioned conformity in private...
...but in public, he upheld family and tradition.
this was a world balanced so precariously...
...that its harmony could be shattered by a whisper.
on the whole, Archer was amused by the smooth hypocrisies of his peers.
he may even have envied them.
lawrence Lefferts, for instance, was New York's foremost...
...authority on form.
and his opinion on pumps versus patent leather Oxfords...
...had never been disputed.
on matters of surreptitious romance, his skills went unquestioned.
old Mr. Sillerton Jackson was as great an authority on family...
...as Lawrence Lefferts was on form.
the mean and melancholy history of Countess Olenska's European marriage...
...was a buried treasure he hastened to excavate.
he carried, like a calling card, an entire register of the scandals...
...and mysteries that had smouldered under the unruffled surface of society...
...for the last 50 years.
now, Julius Beaufort's secret was the way he carried things off.
he could arrive casually at his own party as if he were another guest...
...and might also leave early for a more modest...
...but comforting address in the East Thirties.
Beaufort was intrepid in his business, but in his personal affairs...
...absolutely audacious.
may Welland represented for Archer all that was best in their world...
...all that he honoured, and she anchored him to it.
you see, I've told all my friends, just as you've asked.
Yes, I couldn't wait. Only I wish it hadn't had to be at a ball.
even here we're alone together, aren't we?
the worst of it is that I want to kiss you and I can't.
Newland.
did you tell Ellen as I asked you to? - No, I didn't have a chance after all.
she's my cousin, Newland. If others know before she does...
she's just been away for so long.
she's rather sensitive... - I'll tell her, but I didn't see her yet.
she decided not to come at the last minute.
at the last minute?
she was afraid her dress wasn't smart enough.
we all thought it was so lovely, but she asked my aunt to take her home.
Oh, well.
very handsome.
very liberal.
in my time, a cameo set in pearls was thought to be sufficient.
but it's the hand that sets off the ring, isn't it, my dear Mr. Archer?
it's the new setting. It shows the stone beautifully.
but it looks a little bare to old-fashioned eyes.
I hope you don't mean mine, my dear? I like all the novelties.
my hands were modelled in Paris by the great Roche.
he should do May's. Show me, child.
her hand is so tempered.
it's these modern sports that spread the joints.
but the skin is white.
and when's the wedding to be?
as soon as ever it can, if only you'll back me up, Mrs. Mingott.
they must get to know each other a little better, Mama.
know each other?
everybody in New York has always known everybody.
don't wait till the bubble's off the wine. Marry them before Lent.
I may catch pneumonia any winter now, and I want to give the wedding breakfast.
what a kind offer.
even if she had not been grandmother to May...
...Mrs. Manson Mingott would still have been the first to receive...
...the required betrothal visit.
she was not only the matriarch of this world...
...she was nearly its dowager empress.
much of New York was already related to her...
...and she knew the remainder by marriage or by reputation.
though brownstone was the norm, she lived magisterially...
...within a large house of controversial pale, cream-coloured stone...
...in an inaccessible wilderness near the Central Park.
the burden of her flesh had long since made it impossible for her to go up and down stairs
so, with characteristic independence...
...she had established herself on the ground floor of her house.
from her sitting room, there was an unexpected vista of her bedroom.
her visitors were startled and fascinated by the foreignness of this arrangement...
...which recalled scenes in French fiction.
this was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies.
but if Mrs. Mingott had wanted a lover...
...the intrepid woman would have had him, too.
now, she was content simply for life and passion to flow northward to her door...
...and to anticipate eagerly the union of Newland Archer...
...with her granddaughter, May.
in them, two of New York's best families would finally and momentously be joined.
Bye, Mama. - Good-bye, Augusta.
Ellen. - Ladies.
archer. - Beaufort.
this is a rare favour.
unnecessarily rare, I'd say. - Bonjour, Grand-èr.
I met Countess Ellen in Madison Square.
she was good enough to let me walk along.
this house will be merrier now that she's here.
thank you. - Pull up that tuffet.
this one? - I want a good gossip.
of course you already know about May and me.
she scolded me for not telling you at the opera.
of course I know, and I'm so glad.
one doesn't tell such news first in a crowd.
Oh, careful there.
don't let your ring catch on your sleeve.
good-bye, Ellen. - Good-bye.
good-bye.
come and see me some day.
it's a mistake for Ellen to be seen parading up Fifth Avenue...
...with Julius Beaufort at the crowded hour...
...the very day after her arrival.
his behaviour is so flagrant, even his wife must know about Annie Ring.
Sillerton Jackson enjoyed his frequent visits to the Archer home...
...more than the actual dining.
newland Archer's mother and his sister Janey were both shy women...
...and shrank from society.
but they liked to be informed of its doings, and doted on their bachelor friend.
certain nuances escape Beaufort.
Oh, necessarily. Beaufort is a vulgar man.
no business nuances escape him.
most of New York trusts him with its affairs.
my grandfather Newland always used to say to Mother:
don't let that fellow Beaufort be introduced to the girls.
well, at least he's had the advantage of association with gentlemen.
the Archers and the Mingotts were two of the sturdiest branches of New York's tangled family tree.
granny Mingott's family could embrace May's traditionalism...
...and tolerate Ellen's unconventionality.
but Archer's family held fast to the old ways.
his mother and sister relied on him for every security.
he'd always be, Mrs. Archer assured May's mother, their "strong right hand.
and our new cousin, was she at the ball, too?
I appreciate the Mingotts wanting to support her, to have her at the opera.
I admire their esprit de corps.
but why my son's engagement should be mixed up...
...with this woman's comings and goings, I don't see.
well, in any case, she was not at the ball.
at least she had that decency.
sir?
I wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon.
the dress she wore to the opera was plain and flat.
I'm sure it was in better taste not to go. - It wasn't a question of taste, Mother.
the Countess decided her dress wasn't smart enough.
poor Ellen.
we must always remember the eccentric bringing up she had.
what can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin...
...at her coming-out ball?
it's odd she should have kept such an ugly name as Ellen when she married.
I should have changed it to Elaine.
Why?
I don't know. It sounds more Polish.
it sounds more conspicuous, and that can hardly be what she wishes.
why not? Why shouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses?
she made an awful marriage, but should she hide her head?
should she go slinking around as if she disgraced herself?
she's had an unhappy life. That doesn't make her an outcast.
I'm sure that's the line the Mingotts mean to take.
I don't have to wait for their cue, if that's what you mean, sir.
I'm told she's looking for a house. She intends to live here.
I hear she means to get a divorce.
I hope she will.
understandably, her marriage was intolerable.
but there are the rumours, too. - I've heard them.
the secretary.
he helped get her away from the husband.
they say the Count kept her practically a prisoner.
certainly the Count had his own way of life.
you knew him? - I heard of him at Nice.
handsome, they say, but eyes with a lot of lashes.
when he wasn't with women, he was collecting china.
paying any price for both, I understand.
then where's the blame?
any one of us under those circumstances would help the Countess just as the secretary did.
he was still helping her a year later, then, because somebody met them living together at Lausanne.
living together?
why not? Who has the right to make her life over if she hasn't?
why should we bury her alive if her husband prefers to live with whores?
Oh, it's hardly a question of entombment. The Countess is here, after all.
or do you believe a woman should share the same freedoms as men?
I suppose I do. Yes, I do.
well, apparently Count Olenski takes a similarly modern view.
I never heard of him lifting a finger to get his wife back.
three days later, the unthinkable happened.
Mrs. Manson Mingott sent out invitations summoning everyone to a formal dinner.
such an occasion demanded the most careful consideration.
it required the appropriate plate.
it called for three extra footmen, two dishes for each course...
...and a Roman punch in the middle.
the dinner, New York read on the invitation, was:
to meet the Countess Olenska.
and New York declined.
regret, unable to accept." And from some of our own family.
no one cares enough even to conceal their feelings about the Countess.
this is a disgrace...
they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world.
the real thing was never said or done or even thought...
...but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs.
archer knew these signs.
they were not subtle and were not meant to be.
they were more than a simple snubbing. They were an eradication.
there was a single court of appeal.
he would plead their case before the van der Luydens.
and all this, you think, is due to some intentional interference by...
Larry Lefferts. Yes, sir, I'm certain of it.
the van der Luydens dwelled above all the city's families in a kind of super-terrestrial twilight.
archer appealed to their exquisitely refined sense of tribal order...
...and he spoke plainly.
whenever poor Gertrude Lefferts begins to suspect her husband of something...
...Larry starts making some great diversionary fuss to show how moral he is.
well, it's the principle that I dislike.
I mean to say, if a member of a well-known family is backed by that family...
...it should be considered final.
we all felt this slight on the Countess shouldn't pass without our consulting you.
so, we're are giving a little dinner for our cousin, the Duke of St. Austrey...
...who arrives next week on The Russia.
I'm sure Louisa will be as glad as I am...
...if Countess Olenska will let us include her among our guests.
the occasion was a solemn one.
but the Countess Olenska arrived rather late...
...signalling a carelessness of which she was entirely unaware.
she entered, without haste or embarrassment, the drawing room...
...where New York's most chosen company was somewhat awfully assembled.
countess Olenska.
good evening.
we're delighted that you're here. - Good evening.
the Duke of St. Austrey, may I present Countess Olenska.
Enchantè.
the Trevenna George II plate was out.
so was the van der Luyden Lowestoft...
...from the East India Company, and the Dagonet Crown Derby.
dining with the van der Luydens was, at best, no light matter.
dining there with a duke who was their cousin...
...was almost a religious solemnity.
when the van der Luydens chose, they knew how to give a lesson.
it was not the custom in New York drawing rooms for a lady to get up...
...and walk away from one gentleman in order to seek the company of another.
but the Countess did not observe this rule.
I want you to talk to me about May.
you knew the duke before? - From Nice.
we saw him every winter.
he's very fond of gambling and used to come to our house a great deal.
he likes to wear the same suit every evening.
he thinks it brings him luck.
I think he's the dullest man I ever met.
but he seems to be admired here.
may I tell you what most interests me about New York?
not all the blind obeying of tradition, somebody else's tradition.
it seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it a copy of another country.
do you suppose Christopher Columbus took all that trouble...
...just to go to the opera with Larry Lefferts?
well, I think if he'd suspected that Lefferts were here...
...the Santa Maria might never have left port.
and May? Does she share these views?
well, if she does, she'd never say so.
are you very much in love with her?
as much as a man can be.
do you think there's a limit?
if there is, I haven't found it.
it's really and truly a romance then...
...not in the least arranged.
have you forgotten, in our country we don't allow...
...our marriages to be arranged?
Yes, I forgot. I'm sorry, I...
sometimes I make these mistakes.
I don't always remember that everything here is good...
...that was bad where I came from.
I'm so sorry. - No.
but you know you are among friends here.
Yes, I know. That's why I came home.
good evening.
you'll want to be with May.
I'm so pleased to meet you.
she's already surrounded by so many rivals.
Yes.
then stay with me a little longer.
Yes.
Mr. Urban Dagonet, may I present the Countess Olenska.
how do you do, my dear? - How do you do?
tomorrow then. After five, I'll expect you.
tomorrow.
excuse me.
it was good of you to devote yourself to Madame Olenska...
...so unselfishly, dear Newland. I told Henry he really must rescue you.
I think I've never seen May looking lovelier.
the Duke thinks her the handsomest woman in the room.
Mr. Archer.
so, how do you like this odd little house?
to me, it's like heaven.
you've arranged it delightfully. - Yes.
some of the things I managed to bring with me.
little pieces of wreckage.
at least it's less gloomy than the van der Luydens' and...
...not so difficult to be alone.
I am sure it's often thought the van der Luydens' is gloomy...
...though I've never heard it said before.
but tell me, do you really like to be alone?
as long as my friends keep me from being lonely.
I see you've already chosen your corner. - Yes.
please, sit. - Thank you.
this is the hour I like best.
don't you? - I was afraid you'd forgotten the hour.
I'm sure Beaufort can be very intriguing.
he took me to see some houses.
I'm told I must move.
even though this street seems perfectly respectable.
Yes, but it's not fashionable.
fashionable? Is fashion such a serious consideration?
among people who have nothing more serious to consider.
perhaps I've been too independent.
all I really want is to feel cared for and safe.
thank you.
the van der Luydens do nothing by halves.
all New York laid itself out for you last night.
it was so kind. Such a nice party.
cream or lemon?
lemon, please.
the van der Luydens are the most powerful influence in New York society.
they very seldom receive because of cousin Louisa's health.
perhaps that's the reason, then.
thank you. The reason? - For their influence.
they make themselves so rare.
but, of course, you must tell me.
no, it's you telling me.
thank you.
then we can both help each other.
but I need help so much more.
there are so many people already to tell you what to do.
I think they're all a little angry with me for setting up for myself.
still, your family can advise you, show you the way.
is New York such a labyrinth?
I thought it was all straight up and down, like Fifth Avenue.
all the cross streets numbered, and big honest labels on everything.
everything is labelled, but everybody is not.
then I must count on you for warnings, too.
all the older women like and admire you. They want to help.
I know. As long as they don't hear anything unpleasant.
does no one here want to know the truth, Mr. Archer?
the real loneliness is living among all these kind people...
...who only ask you to pretend.
no, you mustn't.
madam Olenska...
Ellen...
does no one cry here either? I suppose there's no need to.
Mr. Archer, good evening.
we didn't see you this morning and we weren't sure whether to send...
... Miss Welland the usual... - Lilies of the valley. Yes.
we'd better make that a standing order. - Very good, sir.
and those yellow roses.
I'll give you another address. - Very good.
George.
Mr. Archer, two separate orders.
they'll go at once? - At once, sir.
it's wonderful to wake every morning with lilies of the valley in my room.
it's like being with you. - They came late yesterday.
somehow, the time got away from me.
but still, you always remember.
I sent some roses to your cousin Ellen, too. Was that right?
very right.
she didn't mention it at lunch today, though.
she said she got some wonderful orchids from Mr. Beaufort...
...and a hamper of carnations from cousin Henry van der Luyden.
she was so very delighted.
don't people send flowers in Europe?
I know you do consider it a long time. - Very long.
the Chivers were engaged for a year and a half.
Larry Lefferts and Gertrude were engaged for two.
I'm sure Mama expects something customary.
your parents have always let you have your way.
you're almost 22. Tell your mother what you want.
I couldn't refuse her the last thing she'd ever ask of me as a little girl.
can't we just strike out for ourselves?
shall we elope?
well, if you would, why not?
you do love me, Newland. I'm so happy.
well, why not be happier?
I couldn't be happier, dearest. Did I tell you I showed Ellen the ring?
she thought it was the most beautiful setting.
she said there was nothing like it in the Rue de la Paix.
I do love you, Newland.
everything you do is so special.
I want to call on your legal skills for a rather delicate matter.
countess Olenska wants to sue her husband for divorce.
it's been suggested she means to marry again, although she denies it.
because of...
I beg your pardon, sir, but because of my engagement...
...perhaps another member of the firm could consider this matter.
precisely because of your alliance, and considering that members of the family have already asked for you, I'd like you to consider the case.
it's a family matter. Perhaps it's best settled by the family.
their position is clear. They're entirely, and rightly, against a divorce.
but Countess Olenska still insists on a legal opinion.
but really, what's the use of a divorce?
she's here, he's there.
the whole Atlantic's between them.
as things go, Olenski's acted generously.
he's already returned some of the money without being asked.
she'll never get a dollar more than that.
although I understand she attaches no importance to the money.
considering all that, the wisest thing really is to do as the family says.
just let well enough alone.
I think that's for her to decide.
have you considered the consequences if the Countess decides for divorce?
the consequences for the Countess? - For everyone.
I don't think the Count's accusations are anything more than vague charges.
it will make for some talk.
well, I have heard talk about the Countess and the secretary.
I heard it before I read the legal papers. - It's certain to be unpleasant.
unpleasant?
divorce is always unpleasant, don't you agree?
naturally. - Then I can count on you.
the family can count on you.
you will use your influence against a divorce?
I can't promise that. Not until I've talked to the Countess.
I don't understand you, Mr. Archer.
you want to marry into a family with a scandalous divorce suit hanging over it?
I don't think that has anything to do with the case.
can someone take this for me to the Countess, please?
Buonasera. - Thank you.
you refuse such an invitation on the threat of death.
is it so bad? - No, if you have a taste for slow agony.
that's something I've not cultivated.
three days at Skuytercliff with the van der Luydens!
take your fur and a hot water bottle.
is the house that cold? - No, but Louisa is.
Mr. Archer.
join me at Delmonico's on Sunday instead. I'm having a oyster supper in your honour.
private room, congenial company, artists and so on.
very tempting. I haven't met a single artist here.
I know one or two painters I could bring to see you, if you'd allow me.
painters? Are there any painters in New York?
thank you, but I was really thinking of singers, actors, musicians...
...dramatic artists.
there were always so many at my husband's house.
may I write tomorrow and let you know? It's too late to decide this evening.
is this late? - Yes.
because I still have to talk business with Mr. Archer.
of course, Newland, if you can persuade the Countess to change her mind about Sunday, you can join us, too.
you know painters then? You live in their milieu?
not exactly.
but you care about such things? - Immensely.
when I'm in Paris or London, I never miss an exhibition.
I try to keep up. - I used to care immensely, too.
my life was full of such things, but now I want to cast off all my old life to become a complete American and try to be like everybody else.
I don't think you'll ever quite be like everybody else.
don't say that to me, please.
I just want to put all the old things behind me.
I know.
Mr. Letterblair told me.
Mr. Letterblair?
Yes. I've come because he asked me to. I'm in the firm.
you mean it'll be you who'll manage everything for me?
I can talk to you. That's so much easier. - Yes, I'm here to talk about it.
I've read all the legal papers...
...and the letter from the Count.
it was vile.
but if he chooses to fight the case, he can say things that might be...
...that might be disagreeable to you.
say them publicly so that they could be damaging even if...
if?
even if they were unfounded.
what harm could accusations like that do me here?
perhaps more harm than anywhere else.
our legislation favours divorce, but our social customs don't.
never?
well, not if the woman has appearances in the least degree against her.
has exposed herself by any unconventional behaviour to offensive insinuations and...
Yes, so my family tells me.
our family. You'll be my cousin soon.
and you agree with them?
what could you possibly gain that would make up for the scandal?
my freedom.
but aren't you free already?
it's my business to help you see things the way the people who are fondest of you see them, all your friends and relations.
if I didn't show you honestly how they judge such matters...
...it wouldn't be fair of me, would it?
no, it wouldn't be fair.
very well, I'll do as you wish.
I do want to help you. - You do help me.
good night, cousin.
miss Molly, for mercy's sake, don't cry so bitterly!
forget what I've done! - On one condition.
I accept it, whatever it may be.
never speak a word of love to me again. - Never.
on my honour.
heaven bless you.
farewell.
it's fascinating.
every season, the same play, the same scenes, the same effect on the audience.
remarkable, isn't it, Newland?
I'm enjoying it even more than the London production.
you see this play even when you travel?
I'd travel to get away from it. - So, was it a dinner?
it was a reception at Mrs. Struthers', given on the Lord's day...
...but with champagne and singing from the table tops.
people say there was dancing. - It was a real French Sunday then?
well, dissipation can be wonderfully energizing...
do you think her lover will send her a box of yellow roses tomorrow morning?
I was thinking about that, too.
the farewell scene.
Yes, I know.
it touches me as well.
I usually leave the theatre after that to take the picture away with me.
I had a letter from May from St. Augustine.
they always spend the winter there on account of her mother's bronchitis.
and what do you do while May is away?
I do my work.
I do want you to know what you advised me was right.
things can be so difficult sometimes, and I'm so grateful.
the next day, Newland Archer searched the city in vain for yellow roses.
from his office, he sent a note to Madame Olenska asking to call that afternoon and requesting reply by messenger.
there was no reply that day or the next.
and when yellow roses were again available, Archer passed them by.
it was only on the third day that he heard from her by post...
...from the van der Luydens' country home.
Newland, I ran away the day after I saw you at the play...
...and these kind friends have taken me in.
I wanted to be quiet and think things over.
I feel so safe here. I wish that you were with us.
yours sincerely.
he had received an invitation from the Lefferts for a weekend on the Hudson, and he hoped it was not too late to reply.
their house was not far from the van der Luydens.
I came to see what you were running away from.
I knew you'd come. - That shows you wanted me to.
cousin May wrote. She asked you to take care of me.
I didn't need to be asked. - Why?
does that mean I'm so helpless and defenceless?
or that women here are so blessed they never feel need?
what sort of need?
please don't ask me. I don't speak your language.
Henry left the old patroon house open for me.
I wanted to see it.
when you wrote me, you were unhappy.
Yes, but I can't feel unhappy when you're here.
I shan't be here long. - I know.
Ellen, if you really wanted me to come...
...if I'm really to help you...
...you must tell me what you're running from.
is he what you were running from?
or what you expected? - I didn't know he was here.
Hello, Beaufort. This way. Madame Olenska was expecting you.
hello.
well, you've certainly led me on a bit of a chase.
all this way just to tell you I've found the perfect little house for you.
it's not on the market yet so you must take it at once.
well, Archer, rusticating?
that night, he did not take the customary comfort in his monthly shipment of books from London.
the taste of the usual was like cinders in his mouth.
and there were moments when he felt as if he were being buried alive under his future.
Newland, come late tomorrow. I must explain to you. Ellen.
Newland.
has anything happened? - Yes.
I found I had to see you.
what is it? - Nothing.
so, tell me what you do all day.
well, there are a few very pleasant people from Philadelphia...
...and Baltimore who are picnicking at the inn.
and the Merrys are setting up a lawn tennis court.
but nobody here has really heard of the game yet so...
I have my racquet, of course, and so does Kate Merry...
...but she's had this terrible case of bronchitis the last month.
she's still not quite over it yet...
...could have a match?
I came here because I thought I could persuade you to break away from all that.
to advance our engagement.
don't you understand how much I want to marry you?
why should we dream away another year?
I'm not sure I do understand, Newland.
is it because you're not certain of feeling the same way about me?
what on earth do you mean?
is there someone else?
someone else?
between you and me?
let's talk frankly, Newland.
I've felt a difference in you, especially since our engagement.
since our engagement?
if it's not true, then it won't hurt to discuss it. If it's true, then why shouldn't we discuss it now? I mean.
you might have made a mistake.
if I'd made a mistake, would I be here asking you to hurry our marriage?
I don't know, you might.
it would be one way to settle the question.
in Newport, two years ago, before we were promised...
...everyone said there was someone else for you.
I even saw you with her once, sitting together on a veranda at a dance.
when she came into the house, her face looked so sad.
I felt sorry for her.
and even after when we were engaged, I could still see how she looked and...
is that all you've been concerned about?
it's long past.
then is there something else? - No!
of course not.
whatever it may have been, I can't have my happiness made out of a wrong to somebody else.
if promises were made, or if you feel in some way pledged to her, even if it means her getting a divorce then don't give her up because of me.
there are no pledges. There are no promises that matter.
that's all I've been trying to say. There's no one between us.
there is nothing between us, May.
which is precisely my argument for getting married quickly.
he could feel her dropping back to inexpressive girlishness.
her conscience had been eased of its burden.
it was wonderful, he thought, how such depths of feeling could coexist with such an absence of imagination.
and did you succeed? - No.
though I'd still like to be married in April, with your help.
now you're seeing the Mingott way.
is this really so difficult? - The entire family is difficult.
not one of them wants to be different.
when they are different, they end up like Ellen's parents.
nomads, continental wanderers, dragging Ellen about.
lavishing on her an expensive but incoherent education.
out of all of them, not one takes after me but my little Ellen.
you've got a quick eye. Why in the world didn't you marry her?
well, for one thing, she wasn't there to be married.
no, to be sure.
and she's still not.
the Count, you know, he's written to Mr. Letterblair.
he wants her back on her own terms.
the Count doesn't defend himself, I will say that.
and Ellen will be losing a great deal if she stayed here.
there's her old life, gardens at Nice, jewels...
...of course, music and conversation.
she says she goes unnoticed in Europe.
but I know her portrait has been painted nine times.
all this, and the remorse of a guilty husband.
I'd rather see her dead.
would you really?
we should remember marriage is marriage and Ellen is still a wife.
Ellen! See who's here!
Yes, I know. I...
I went to see your mother to ask where you'd gone.
since you never answered my note, I was afraid you might be ill.
well, he was in such a rush to get married, that's why.
fresh off the train and straight here.
he wants me to use all my influence just to marry his sweetheart sooner.
surely, Granny, between us we can persuade the Wellands to do as he wishes.
there, Newland, you see?
right to the quick of the problem, like me. I told him he should've married you.
and what did he say? - My darling, I leave you to find that out.
I wish I didn't have to leave. I shall see you very soon, I hope.
fine.
I'll see you out.
when can I see you?
Nastasia, the Struthers are sending the carriage at seven.
alle 7: 00. Informami subito quando arriva.
good evening.
who's ridiculous enough to send me a bouquet?
I'm not going to a ball and I'm not engaged.
Nastasia! Some people are always ridiculous.
take these to that nice family down the street.
I'll tell you, in almost everything she says, there's something true and something untrue. Why?
what has Granny been telling you?
I think she believes you might go back to your husband.
I think she believes you might at least consider it.
a lot of things have been believed of me.
but if she thinks I would consider it, that also means she would consider it for me, as Granny is weighing your idea of advancing the marriage.
may and I had a frank talk in Florida.
it's probably our first.
she wants a long engagement to give me time.
time for what?
she thinks I want to marry her at once to get away from someone I care for more.
time to give her up for another woman?
if I want to.
it's very noble. - Yes.
and it's ridiculous.
Why?
because there is no other woman?
no.
because I don't mean to marry anyone else.
this other woman, does she love you, too?
there is no other woman!
the person that May was thinking of was never...
that must be your carriage.
Yes, I...
I suppose I should be leaving soon.
to Mrs. Struthers?
Yes.
I must go where I'm invited or I shall be too lonely.
why not come with me?
may guessed the truth.
there is another woman.
only not the one she thinks.
don't make love to me. Too many people have done that.
I've never made love to you!
I would've married you if it had been possible for either of us.
you're the one who's made it impossible.
I've made it!
isn't it you who made me give up divorcing?
didn't you talk to me here in this house about sacrifice and sparing scandal?
for May's sake and yours, I did what you asked.
there were things in your husband's letter...
I had nothing to fear from that letter. Absolutely nothing.
I was just afraid of scandal for the family and you and May.
nothing's done that can't be undone.
I'm still free.
you can be, too.
can I marry May now? Do you see me marrying May now?
I don't see you putting that question to May, do you?
I have to. It's too late to do anything else.
you say that because it's easy to say at this moment...
...not because it's true.
I don't understand you.
you don't understand because you don't yet realize...
...how you've changed things for me.
you don't know all that you've done. - All I've done?
all the good things you've done for me that I never knew.
going to the van der Luydens because people refused to meet me.
announcing your engagement at the ball so there would be two families standing behind me, instead of one.
I never understood how dreadful people thought I was.
granny blurted it out one day.
I was stupid. I never thought. New York meant freedom to me.
everyone seemed so kind and glad to see me.
but they never knew what it meant to be tempted.
but you did. You understood.
I'd never known that before.
and it's better than anything I've known.
Newland, you couldn't be happy if it meant being cruel.
if we act any other way I'll be making you act against what I love in you most.
and I can't go back to that way of thinking.
don't you see? I can't love you unless I give you up.
Ellen, Granny's telegram was successful.
grandma and Mama agreed to marriage after Easter.
only a month. I will telegraph Newland.
I'm too happy for words and love you dearly.
your grateful cousin, May.
there had been wild rumours right up to the wedding day...
...that Mrs. Mingott would actually attend the ceremony.
it was known that she had sent a carpenter to measure the front pew...
...in case it might be altered to accommodate her.
but this idea, like the great lady herself, proved to be unwieldy...
...and she settled for giving the wedding breakfast.
the Countess Olenska sent her regrets.
she was travelling with an aunt...
...but gave the bride and groom an exquisite piece of old lace.
two elderly aunts in Rhinebeck offered a honeymoon cottage...
...and since it was thought "very English" to have a country house on loan...
...their offer was accepted.
when the house proved suddenly uninhabitable however...
...Henry van der Luyden stepped in to offer an old cottage on his property nearby.
may accepted the offer as a surprise for her husband.
she'd never seen the house...
...but her cousin Ellen had mentioned it once.
she had said it was the only house in America...
...where she could imagine being perfectly happy.
they travelled to the expected places, which May had never seen.
in London, Archer ordered his clothes, and they went to the National Gallery...
...and sometimes to the theatre.
I hope I don't look ridiculous. I've never dined out in London.
english women dress like everybody else in the evening, don't they?
how can you say that...
...when they're always at the theatre in old ball dresses and bare heads?
well, maybe they save their new dresses for home.
then I shouldn't have worn this. - No. You look very fine.
really, quite beautiful.
in Paris, she ordered her clothes.
there were trunks of dresses from Worth. They visited the Tuileries.
may's hands were modelled in marble at Roche's studio.
and occasionally, they dined out.
it's a precious freedom, to be sure.
but tell me, you were saying you were actually advised here by Maupassant?
Yes.
unfortunately, I was advised not to write.
archer embraced his new marriage...
...even as he reverted to his old, inherited ideas about matrimony.
it was less trouble to conform with tradition.
there was no use trying to emancipate a wife who hadn't the dimmest notion that she was not free.
when we were in London, we only managed one day at the National.
we were taken up by a Mrs. Carfry and Mrs. Harle.
we had an awfully good talk. He's an interesting fellow.
we talked about books and many different things.
I thought I'd invite him to dinner.
the Frenchman? - Yes.
I didn't have much chance to talk to him, but wasn't he a little common?
common?
I thought he was clever.
I suppose I shouldn't have known if he was clever.
then I won't ask him to dine.
with a chill, he knew that in the future many problems would be solved for him in this same way.
the first six months of marriage were usually said to be the hardest. After that, he thought, they would've pretty nearly finished polishing down all the rough edges.
but May's pressure was already wearing down the very roughness he most wanted to keep.
as for the madness with Madame Olenska...
...Archer trained himself to remember it as the last of his discarded experiments.
she remained in his memory simply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts.
she's very deft.
Yes, but that's the only kind of target she'll ever hit.
no one could ever be jealous of May's triumphs.
she gave the feeling that she would have been just as serene without them.
but what if all her calm, her niceness, were just a negation...
...a curtain dropped in front of an emptiness?
archer felt he had never yet lifted that curtain.
quite stunning, isn't it?
it's Julius Beaufort who donates the club's prizes, isn't it?
this looks like him, of course. It will make quite an heirloom, my dear.
you should leave it to your eldest daughter.
what's the matter? Won't there be any daughters?
only sons? What, can't I say that either? Look at her blushing.
Ellen, are you upstairs?
she's over from Portsmouth, spending the day with me.
it's such a nuisance. She just won't stay in Newport.
insists on putting up with those, what's their name?
Blenkers.
but I gave up arguing with young people 50 years ago. Ellen?
I'm sorry, ma'am, Miss Ellen's not in the house.
she's left? - I saw her going down the shore path.
run down and fetch her like a good grandson.
may and I will have a gossip about Julius Beaufort.
go ahead. I know she'll want to see you both.
is it true Beaufort has given Annie Ring a diamond bracelet?
I hear he even plans to bring her to Newport.
he had heard her name often enough during the year and a half since they'd last met.
he was even familiar with the main incidents of her life.
but he heard all these accounts with detachment...
...as if listening to reminiscences of someone long dead.
but the past had come again into the present...
...as in those newly-discovered caverns in Tuscany...
...where children had lit...
...bunches of straw and seen old images staring from the wall.
he gave himself a single chance.
she must turn before the sailboat crosses the Lime Rock light.
then he would go to her.
I'm sorry you didn't find her, but I've heard she's so changed.
changed?
so indifferent to her old friends. Summering in Portsmouth.
moving to Washington. Sometimes I think we've always bored her.
I wonder if she wouldn't be happier with her husband after all.
I don't think I've ever heard you be cruel before.
cruel?
even demons don't think people are happier in hell.
then she shouldn't have married abroad.
here, let me. Go on, walk on.
the Blenkers?
a party for the Blenkers?
who are they?
the Portsmouth people. Countess Olenska is staying with them.
professor and Mrs. Emerson Sillerton request the pleasure...
... Wednesday Afternoon Club, at three o'clock punctually...
... to meet Mrs. and the Misses Blenker. Red Gables, Catherine Street.
I don't think we can decline.
I don't see why, really.
he's an archaeologist and he...
and he's Sillerton Jackson's cousin. - Of course.
some of us will have to go. - I'll go over.
and Janey, why don't you come with me?
I'm sure cousin Ellen will be there. It will give you a chance to see her.
Newland, you can find a way to spend your afternoon, can't you?
I think, for a change, I'll just save it instead of spending it.
maybe I'll drive to the farm to see about a new horse for the brougham.
at least the Jacksons didn't choose the day of the Cup Race for their party.
of course, we shouldn't be surprised if they had.
Hello?
I'm sorry. Did you ring? I've been asleep in the hammock.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
are you Miss Blenker? I'm Newland Archer.
Oh, yes. I've heard so much about you.
I came up the island to look for a new horse.
I thought I'd call but their house seems empty.
it is empty. They're all at the party.
everyone's there but me with my fever and Countess Olenska.
Oh, you found my parasol!
it's my best one. It's from the Camarouge.
it's very pretty.
the Countess was called away? - Yes, a telegram came from Boston.
she said she might be gone for two days.
I do love the way she does her hair, don't you?
it reminds me of Sir Walter Scott.
you don't know... I'm sorry, but I have to be in Boston tomorrow.
you wouldn't happen to know where she was staying?
Ellen, I'm here on business. I just got here, actually.
you're doing your hair differently. - Only because my maid's not here.
she stayed back in Portsmouth. I'm here only for two days.
it didn't seem worthwhile. - You're travelling alone?
Yes. Why?
do you think it's a little dangerous? - Well, it's unconventional.
Yes, I suppose it is.
I've just done something so much more unconventional.
I refused to take back money that belonged to me.
someone came with an offer?
what were the conditions?
I refused. - Tell me the conditions.
nothing unbearable, really.
just to sit at the head of his table now and then.
and he wants you back at any price?
well, it's a considerable price.
at least, it's considerable for me.
so, you came to see him?
my husband? Here? No, of course not.
he sent someone.
his secretary?
Yes.
he's still here, in fact.
he insisted on waiting, in case I changed my mind.
you haven't changed, Newland.
I had changed until I saw you again.
please, don't.
just give me the day. I'll say anything or nothing.
I won't speak unless you tell me to.
all I want is some time with you.
to get you away from that man. Will he come to the hotel?
at eleven. Just in... - Then we must go now.
I'll have to leave a note at the hotel. - Write on this. I have the paper.
you see how everything is predestined?
and these. Have you seen this? The new stylographic pen.
it's like jerking down the mercury in a thermometer.
now try that.
it's not working.
that should do it.
shall I take it in? - I'll be only a moment.
why didn't you come to get me the day I was at Granny's?
because you didn't turn around.
I swore... I swore I wouldn't call you unless you turned around.
but I didn't look around on purpose.
you knew?
