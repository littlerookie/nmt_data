one Love has the ball!
here! Pass it! Right here, Keith! Right here!
[Keith] Man, if we had Coach Roy, we'd never lose.
Touchdown! - Oh, here's the
[Audience Cheering] - All right, our next guest...
is looking to get back into the game he loves, and this time...
he promises not to ruffle any more feathers.
[Arnold] Aw! - Please welcome the former head coach at Ohio Polytech...
Hey! - How are ya?
Roy, you're a man of your word. You said you'd come on the show when you were available.
and, brother, you are really available now.
well, you know, I'm weighin' my options. I'm a free agent, baby.
[Applause] - My fans!
word on the street is you couldn't get a job right now fielding sheep.
look, I wanna go somewhere where- where the desire to win is just great, you know.
cause y'all know I'm a winner, and l - I kind of wanna go back to my roots.
[Coach Roy] That's right. - Come with me.
come on. I got a plan. Come on.
anything yet? - It's ringing.
there? - Mm-hmm.
I'll get it. Stay. - Whatever.
[Coach Roy] Man, this is a junior high.
I won three N.C.B.A. Championships. I mean, what do I gotta do?
Roy, don't you see it? It's perfect. It's your old school.
look, we accept their offer.
you work with these kids for a week. They get a huge thrill out of it.
duh! You look like a saint...
and we get free P.R. which, no offense, Roy, we desperately need.
in the meantime, it'll give me a chance to land us a solid job offer.
what offers do we have now? - Hmm?
Doreen, this is the supplemental budget.
could you get me the full budget, please?
hon, that is the full budget.
tim Fink, principal partner, the Fink Agency. Fink FastÔºÅ
principal, Mount Vernon Junior H
Whoo! Whoa! Wow! Okay, it's coach Roy.
coach Roy is in the house.
[Whispering] Coach Roy is here. It's my house.
all right. Well, then, gentlemen - Uh-oh!
community service? Did you get arrested for something?
we get more great sports guys that way.
we're here to accept your offer.
Yea! No idea what you're talking about.
your offer.
Mm-hmm. Oh, my.
Oh, my goodness.
just
s - Spelling error.
so you're telling me that Roy McCormick...
wants to coach here?
am I gettin' Punk'd?
Roy's gonna work with your team.
they're gonna be coached by the best of the best...
for absolutely - wait for it - no charge.
[Coach Roy] Yeah, I wanna give back to the community.
you know, here's where I found my first true love, which is basketball.
well, teamwork. So I guess that's two loves.
two loves. - Mm-hmm.
that was very inspiring, coach.
well, uh, gosh, gentlemen.
I guess
follow me.
[Principal Walsh] People. Apparently...
some of you have tried to circumvent school policy...
and hire a new head coach on your own.
well, I'm impressed.
without further ado, please welcome your new head coach.
they're really short.
Yeah, they're 13.
all right, well, good luck, kids.
and, uh, behave yourself.
[Keith] Oh, we will.
I was talking to him.
coach Roy, I'm a big fan. I've seen all your commercials.
a couple things I should warn you about.
Ralph here, for instance, when he gets nervous, he pukes.
you my assistant head coach? - Real honor working with you.
Yeah, I appreciate it. Well, uh, why don't you run and fetch me a patty melt?
maybe one with your arms around the kids having fun?
Yeah, sure thing.
huh? Got it? That's right.
y'all look basketball style.
we're never gonna lose again. - Yeah.
one Love's definitely on the way to getting a shoe contract now.
Yeah! - How you feeling, Ralph?
[Vomiting] - Oh!
Oh! Priceless.
y'all run some drills. All right?
I'm gonna try to get this guck off my shoe.
excuse me, Mr. Photographer.
we don't know any drills. - Or have any skills.
we'll just have to make some up then. Come on.
okay, great drill. Let's run our passing drill now.
come on.
let's step it up.
[Sighs] - Mary, is it really a good idea?
you know, Jeanie, you may find this hard to believe...
but I don't get a lot of gifts here at Mount Vernon.
I got no money. I got no resources. I got no nothin'.
excuse me. That's a double negative.
Bethanne, stick it where the sun don't not shine.
so, when one of the best coaches in basketball wants to coach my kids for free...
kids who, incidentally, are on their way to another no-win season...
I'm not gonna say no.
Oh, okay. Great, great. So that's the criteria?
if he's never hit a kid, then he can work at Mount Vernon.
Yeah, I know. But check it out.
if he steps out of line in any way...
all we have to do is call the N.C.B.A. and he's out of here.
so I think he's gonna be on his best behavior.
okay, how are you gonna run a school and monitor a madman?
well, Jeanie, I'm not.
Uh-uh! No, no, no, no, no! I'm not either.
uh, uh, uh- - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
you go to all the games anyway. You could be my eyes and ears.
Yeah. The minute you say he's out of line, he's gone.
come on. Girls, trust me.
coach Roy is going to do wonders for this school.
coach Roy has some issues- - Uh!
that he needs to work- - Uh!
a little bit...
out.
[Chattering] - Stop. Stop. Stop.
[Goggles] You really bleed a lot. High blood pressure.
too much stress. - What's that? CK-One?
how much do they pay you to put that on your hankie? - Let me smell it.
look, I don't care how many titles he's won.
I don't care anything about that. I know his reputation.
come on. Give him a chance. - For what?
he's got some problems, and if he touches my son
stay away from my son!
[Keith] Mom, he didn't hit anybody.
yet. He just got here. Give him a chance.
we hit him and barfed on him.
Plus, his Escalade got tagged.
[Groans] - But he doesn't know that yet.
look, I'm sorry.
my name is Jeanie, and it's just my son means a lot to me.
look, uh. - Excuse me. Miss Jeanie?
now, look, I know my reputation precedes me.
but it's just rep, you know? It's not true.
Roy McCormick. Very nice to meet you.
I know who you are. My son idolizes you.
well, your son, he's-he's a good kid.
I think he's gonna do big things in this game.
he's gonna be all right. - Well, that's good to know, because that's not my son.
that's my son.
he's gonna be good too, 'cause they-they run drills together, so they kind of know the same drills.
and, quite frankly, I don't like the way you treat your players.
my son doesn't need some hotshot egomaniac...
trying to tell him he's good, because he is good.
ma'am - Miss Jeanie, look, I swear...
the only reason I'm here is - is to help these kids.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt 'em. Now, that temper tantrum thing is long gone.
well, it was nice meeting you.
very nice meetin' you.
if you don't mind, maybe I can call you sometime or somethin'?
I don't think so.
dude, Roy's checking out your mom.
he ain't lyin'.
coach Roy, what's it like coming back to coach at your old school?
it's a'ight, you know, and, you know
I grew up in the mean streets - the suburbs.
okay? I had one dream, and that was to get out...
not end up here like these losers...
who, I guess, I would love to give back to.
for such a great coach, he really doesn't do much, does he?
no.
there's a game today? - That's why we're in uniform.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
you don't remember me, do you?
I applied to be your assistant coach seven times.
you said that I was too rigid.
turns out I wasn't so rigid, I couldn't lead the Vikings to nine state championships.
Wow. I didn't know middle schools had state championships.
well, they do, and I won them nine times.
nine times? Big kudos for ya.
F.Y.I. The only kid you need to look out for on my team is my son, Larry Jr.
all right, well, good luck, man.
you're in my house!
this is my world! You be in my world now!
no mercy. - [Whistle Blowing]
one, two, three. - [All] No mercy!
let's get some!
Oh! Way downtown! Yeah!
one Love is cutting! One Love is open!
one Love has the ball! One Love is shaking! One Love is baking!
Aah! My shoe!
aren't you supposed to be doing something?
Yeah, I'm thinking about what I'm gonna eat for lunch. You interested?
Keith, I'm open! - [One Love] One Love is wide open!
pass the ball! - Keith, One Love is open!
has your kid ever heard of passin'?
we had position, ref! Where's the call?
[Whistle Blowing] - Charge!
Oh! Thank you!
are you kiddin' me? That was 10 minutes ago.
Oh. [Chuckles]
that's our ref - "Late" Carl Freedburg.
he's a good guy. He's a little slow on the whistle, though.
Keith, pass. - [Coach Roy] Time out!
listen, I don't mind you embarrassin' yourselves...
cause you're used to it, okay?
but now, you're startin' to embarrass me.
what's your name? - My name's Keith.
Keith, do you think you can, uh, try not to turn the ball over?
guys, I need you to get out there and go to work, okay?
and try to keep it in single digits. Let's go, guys. Let's go!
[Scoffs] We wouldn't wanna humiliate him.
that's a winning attitude.
Keith, the ball! - Hey.
what is he doing?
[All] Two! Four! Six! Eight! Who do we appreciate?
Smelters!
what'll those Canadians think of next? Speaking of animal lovers...
in a follow-up to a recent story...
former N.C.B.A. Madman Coach Roy McCormick lost his first game today...
former N. C.B. A. Madman Coach Roy McCormick lost his first game today...
in the cutthroat middle school division!
[Laughter] - I swear to God.
109 to nothing. For real!
he has to teach the kids fundamentals, things like which basket is ours.
[Man] Yeah, like jump ball means that your team has gotta jump too.
look, Roy's gotta do a betterjob if he wants to coach again in the N.C.B.A.
it's that simple. - [Phone Ringing]
Oh, sh - Oh!
Yeah.
uh, what the heck are you doin'?
Hey, man, what's the big deal, okay? It's middle school. Who cares?
who cares? That's what I said. But, you know, Roy, it made all the national news.
and I had some solid job offers lined up, and now everyone's bailed on us.
look, nobody wants to hire... a loser.
look, you gotta win at least one game with these kids if you ever wanna work again.
Oh, hi. Are you Mr. McCormick?
I'm a big fan. Can I please have your autograph?
sure thing, young lady.
thank you. - [Car Engine Starting]
wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's my car. - That was your car.
it was part of your endorsement deal, and that's been terminated.
have a great day. I still think you're great.
I want my old life back.
huddle up!
now, I'm gonna be honest with you.
I can't afford to lose by triple digits again, or else I'm finished.
so I've decided to teach you how to play the game of basketball.
Yeah, the concept of dribbling, passing and scoring, okay?
so playtime is over. And if you don't like it, the door is right there.
get back here!
I'm gonna need some help.
unbelievable.
give me that! - [Both Shouting]
get off me, boy! You want some too? - [Funk]
unbelievable!
what? - She started it.
shut up! - Go on. You're comin' with me.
look who's in trouble again. - You got somethin' to say?
look, these ain't even allowed in school. Okay?
you a natural. What's your name?
you're comin' with me, all right? - Oh, no. I'm not - No.
I'm not goin' to detention.
it's more like a work release program.
all right? Trust me. Suit up.
come on. Come on, Big Mac. Suit up.
trust me.
whoa. Yao Ming, wait up.
what a dork. - Sorry.
Hey. - Excuse me.
can I help you? - I just wanted to talk to one of your players.
players"? These are my students.
and, no, while Wes is in my class, you can't speak to him.
I'll come back later, okay?
look. Wes is really shy, okay?
and he's not into sports, and he really doesn't need to be pushed around by your type.
my type? - Mm-hmm.
what's my type, since you know me? What's my type?
a bully.
a stubborn, spoiled, always-gets-his-way bully.
you're good.
thank you. - Mm-hmm.
I'll come back after class.
but I do gotta ask somethin'. Look, son, you like basketball?
um, I'm not very coordinated.
man, that's perfect.
nobody else on the team is coordinated.
so join us, please. It's perfect.
you - out! - Just give me one second.
thirty seconds, all right? All right?
son, do you know what everybody wants out of life?
no. - They wanna be loved.
I love you, because...
you are six feet, man...
with extremely long arms, you know?
now, I can't promise you if you join the team that you're gonna get the girls.
I can't- I can help you, you know, see where they at...
but I can't help you get the girls, you know.
and I can't even promise that you're gonna be a good player.
but what I can guarantee you is that, uh...
you won't be the butt of nobody's jokes, son.
how tall are you, son? - Six-two.
Six-two?
I'm deeper and deeper in love!
Wow! Six-two!
will you join us?
I, uh
I have to wear a T-shirt under my jersey...
cause my perspiration gives me dermatitis.
meet me at the gym at 3: 00, 'cause, uh, we practice hard.
I'll be there.
my man. All right.
careful. - Yeah. Thanks.
I'm watchin' you. - Thank you.
[Coach Roy] These here are the new recruits.
this is Wes. You mess with him, you're gonna have to answer to me.
this is Big Mac.
you mess with her, well, you're on your own.
[Man] Are the Smelters running a drill?
Hey, I think that's the girl that stole my wife's car.
don't stare.
just out of curiosity, how long you been shootin' hoops?
for a while in juvie.
well, you're our enforcer, okay?
don't mean you gotta fight. But you got five fouls.
don't be afraid to use 'em.
I don't mind fightin'. - I'm sure.
but you have good hands, and you have good footwork. Use 'em.
that's not what I'm talkin' about.
Yeah, Coach?
look, do yourself a favor. Don't warm up today, all right?
but l - I know. You never, ever played basketball.
but for the next 15 minutes, that's our little secret, okay?
all right. - [Door Opens]
my secret weapon.
no weapon form against thee... shall prosper.
how you doin', my brother?
you always come through for a brother. Hey!
God bless you!
Oh, brother! - Thank you.
you're shinin'. You're shinin' like the light.
look, I got about four or five other engagements I need to get to.
so if we can kind of put a little pep in the step, get this thing movin'.
not a problem. Smelters?
God bless you, basketball babies. How you doin'?
[Muttering Responses] - I'm Preacher Don.
and Coach Roy asked me to come down here and speak with you.
so if l- if I may, I would like to say a prayer with you and coach Roy...
if that's all right.
let's bow our heads, please.
God is good.
God is great.
thank you for this game we're about to receive...
cause we about to get up in them.
thank you for the food that we about to- No, that's the wrong prayer.
God, we ask that you give us the strength...
that everything will go our way out there on the court.
and if that cannot happen, God...
we ask that you injure some key players on the other team...
not so that they get seriously injured...
but that they're slowed up...
so that the Smelters will win this game.
Amen! Amen.
because we know you - God - loves a winner.
[sniffling] Can I get an "amen"?
[All] Amen.
I'm gonna need that cash real quick.
Oh, no problem. - [Buzzer Sounds]
[Blows Whistle] - Back off!
in her rookie debut, Margaret "Big Mac" Green...
won the Smelters' first tip-off since
when's the last time we won a tip? Quick. - Um- '89.
two years before we were born.
wait. Uh - Where do we write our points?
I don't know. We've never had to before.
technical foul, Mount Vernon!
what's wrong with you? - It's a technical foul. Delay of game.
I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to them.
look, you can't have a parade every time you score.
now, get back out there and get your heads in the game.
let's go!
big Mac, you really tryin' my patience.
substitution. Substitution, ref.
I'm bringin' in Sledgehammer. Sledge?
ref, let's get an I.D. Check here. This kid looks old enough to drink.
look, I'm whisperin', okay? I need you to nod your head...
and act like I'm sayin' somethin' important.
I need you to go out here, be cool...
and try not to trip.
can you do that?
I - I think so, Coach. - Thank you, son.
come on.
diamond and one. Diamond and one. Let's go.
set it up. - [Man] Okay, double-team the kid.
double-team the Sledgehammer.
Sledge? Hey? Give me
give me some shake and bake, baby. A double shake and bake.
you know? With a little bit of this, that. [Growling]
double it up. You know what I'm sayin'? All right?
bang with 'em. - What's that?
Hey, hold your ground, okay? Show 'em what it's like to be with the big boy.
bang with 'em. - You feel me?
sledgehammer, huh? Take it to the iron, boys! They're soft inside!
out. - [Whistle Blows]
Hey, you did good, son, all right?
you hung in there a lot longer than I thought you would.
have a seat. Ralph.
you're in.
[Groans] Thanks.
[Whistle Blowing] - [Coach Roy] Come on! Let's go!
Congratulations. You only lost by 45.
that's why you're doin' 45 suicides.
now, let's go. What? What are you doin'here?
what? - Coach, what happens if we win?
fuzzy, if you win- if you win
I'll do a suicide for every point you win by, okay?
now, dig it out! Get back to work.
see the way you're runnin'? That's why you're losin'.
you may wanna embarrass you, but you're not gonna embarrass me!
I pulled out every trick in the book today.
these aren't college kids, Roy. They're 13.
[Sighs] - I mean, you were 13 once, right?
only one thing motivates a 13-year-old boy...
and it ain't Smelter pride.
I just said something smart.
I'm gonna write that down. - [Chuckles]
ladies, free pizza here.
come by the gym, get a slice. All you want. All you want.
all right? [Sniffing]
cheese, yeah. Cheese. Excuse me.
is he serious? - Come on!
my mouth's waterin' already. I can't wait to get to this pizza, y'all.
Hey, did you get the Cinnabon? - Whoa.
cause they supposed to give us a free Cinnabon that goes with these pizzas.
pizza!
guys, layup lines.
but - Layup lines. Come on.
all right. - Is there always gonna be pizza here?
there will be from now on.
you're home ec, right? - Yeah.
how's your pizzas? - Delicious-y for shizzy.
all right. Okay, good, 'cause that's your new job.

Oh. I will not let you down. - All right.
okay. - All right.
there's chicken parm in the crust, ladies, so put your feed bags on.
Hey, green team out. Green team out.
so who are we playin'? - Me.
you the ball handler, huh? Yeah, that's right. I see you. You kinda tight with that rock.
you like to go to the basket. Ain't no "l" in team, huh?
it's about you. Do your thing, man.
check it.
Ooh! Did I anger you? - Just give me the ball.
Oh! What's the Shaq do? What's that move he do when he block people?
no, Mutombo. He do like this.
[Imitating Mutombo] "I don't think that you should bring it in there."
you should get it to one of your teammates.
let's see what you got, man. You gotta use your teammates sometime, man.
huh? Uh-oh. Look, he's mad now.
Ooh! See, when I get blocked, I start looking for my teammates.
you know what I mean? 'Cause they can help me out.
you know? Wow!
but if I get the ball to them late, watch what happens.
I didn't wanna do it. - I didn't wanna do it.
[Panting] I'm hungry.
what's wrong with you? Pass the ball!
dude, come on. Just pass it. We'll give it right back.
come on. Let's go.
[Chuckles] Wait a minute. Comin' at ya.
comin' at - [Laughs]
Comin'at ya. Look. All right.
[Groans] - All right.
you passed the ball, man. How does that feel...
for the ball to go from your hand to another hand?
again. Try it again. Let me show you how you do the one thing.
huh? All right. All right, all right.
all right. All right. All right.
all right. I'm gonna admit, I'm a little tired.
the point I'm tryin'to prove is that teamwork beats out talent any day.
now, one on one, neither one of y'all could beat me.
you know, that's just real. But all five of y'all together...
if y'all play as a team, you might could do something with me.
and I'm gonna keep it real with you like that. [Coughs]
but anyway, l
I gotta- I gotta go throw up.
green team, you're in!
let's go, guys.
one Love, hedge that ball screen.

the highly complex way of beating the pick-and-roll?
somebody?
talking?
talking.
exactly. Talking.
guys, you gotta communicate out there. You're a team.
all right? Communication is the key.
it's like a-a healthy relationship at home.
you know?
you ever flirt around with your lady? You know, your lady say
you, like, "Come on. Come on." Your lady is, like...
no, no, not right now. Remember?
you said that you wanted to take some time to
huh? - You know what?
run the play again till you get it right.
run it! Come on, guys.
ladies, I'm not seeing none of those "R!" You know.
I ain't seein' none of that. Let's go.
come on, people. Guys, communicate out there.
Oh, it is on tonight, baby.

Preston. Hey, partner.
check your e-Mail.
prosecution calls detective Terry Mccandless.
please...
take us through the facts of the case
if you would, detective.
Carrie Baker was working late in her studio on February 6.
computer records show that someone entered her building
with a security card key at 1: 23 a.m.
access card required id verified entry permitted
now, the card key used was the victim's own.
and there was no sign of forced entry.
her business partner found her body
when she came to work the next morning.
Carrie was stabbed in the back of her neck With one of her own tools;
it's called a... a bezel.
was anything missing from the studio?
$80, 000 worth of precious gems, gold and jewelry.
and you found one of these pieces of stolen jewelry on the defendant,
Deshaun Linares, when you went to his home to question him.
is that correct? - Yes, sir.
Mr. Linares was the handyman at the building.
and we also found his finger... - You got an extra pen?
h-his fingerprints in the victim's studio. - No.
could we get the jury some pencils, please?
records show that Deshaun repaired a leak
in the studio's kitchen that week.
perhaps that's how the fingerprints got there.
it's also how he could have stolen her card key.
but... he has his own card key, doesn't he?
he works there.
is there any fiber or DNA evidence
linking Deshaun to the crime scene?
no.
but you arrested him Because you found a ring in his pocket.
did he tell you that Carrie Baker made him this ring personally,
for him to give to his girlfriend?
right, she just gave the handyman a ring
that goes for five grand.
tiny ring. Must be...
size five.
Brenda, would you try this on?
objection. Relevance.
I find it relevant. Overruled.
you may proceed, miss Sawyer.
need quarters?
Thanks.
so, what's with the ring, Jamie?
you trying out for the home shopping network?
I'll tell you a little secret they don't teach you at Wake Forest.
Ooh. - A jury remembers What they see, not what they hear.
but the ring fits, like it was made for her.
just like Deshaun said it was.
but who cares if the ring fits?
it has nothing to do with the facts of the murder.
what facts?
all of your evidence is circumstantial.
state does not have a case, and I know you agree 'Cause you've been phoning it in the whole trial.
how would you know that?
I watch you, I know.
well, you know, I watch you, too, Jamie.
and you know what I see?
I see a yankee lawyer in expensive shoes
who doesn't know how to work a southern jury Or a southern da.
assistant DA.
you see, that is exactly what I'm talking about.
believe me, Roy,
under the right circumstances,
I would know exactly how to work you.
be home soon, all right?
I miss daddy.
are we gonna win this thing, ms. Sawyer?
cause i can't stand to think of My baby girl growing up without me.
we're gonna win.

sit on down.
well, you know Tom, from the mayor's office.
and this is Davis Peel,
director of the South Carolina Democratic Party.
heard a lot about you, Roy.
you hungry?
I already ate.
Roy, you probably know that the mayor Has finally decided to retire.
I think it's safe to say That the next mayor won't be a democrat.
we're advising him to make as many appointments as he can.
what they're trying to say is
he wants you, Roy.
he wants to appoint you city attorney.
me?
it's a big prize.
I mean, I'm in the DA's office.
now, how can I represent the city When I don't even have a firm?
come work here. For us.
we pick up a great lawyer,
and Charleston gets a perfect city attorney.
dec, is this because of my father?
your father was the best city attorney Charleston ever had.
you know, what I remember about my dad being City attorney was that...
we never had enough money to pay the bills.
and I would... I would consider it
if you'd make me a full partner at the firm.
that's what I meant, son.
Charleston PD evidence room. Please hold.
I need to see the gun from 486.
it might take a minute.
can't a guy get a smile?
is that part of my job description?
you smile for Mccandless, don't you, kitten?
Brenda, I saw you with detective Mccandless.
is he bothering you?
wasn't bothering me.
I grew up on a street like this.
south side of Chicago.
my mother was high or drunk most of the time.
I know what it's like...
to avoid attention, especially from cops.
I know how they can make life bad for you.
he's been coming around here.
calling.
I told him i don't want nothin' to do with him.
he says that if i go with him...
and do the things that he wants me to do...
he'll help Deshaun.
and then he started threatening me.
threatening my baby.
Shauny, come here, honey.
we have to lodge a complaint. - No.
no way.
you're a good lawyer.
I got faith in you.
but I ain't got no faith in me takin' on the Charleston PD.
it's a great store.
it's a shame it won't be around.
I know. I tried to keep it going, but...
I can't do it without her.
I don't even want to.
Helen... I know this is hard for you,
but Deshaun is not the killer.
he didn't steal anything.
that's what I keep telling her.
this is Kenny. He's my boyfriend.
how well do you know Deshaun?
pretty well.
he's a good kid.
I don't know what to believe.
look, I think the detective on this case took the easy way out.
he fingered Deshaun and didn't look any further.
I'm gonna reexamine everything...
his evidence, and his reports.
let's find out who did this.
you gonna forward that one to your buddies, too?
I didn't forward nothin'. - You think I don't see the way
some of the guys around here are looking at me?
lee Anne, shh. - I am done, Terry. I am done.
I should've ended it a long time ago. - It's over when I say it's over.
now, I can forward those pictures Right up to the deputy chief, but that wouldn't be too good For your career, now, would it?
you'd go right down with me.
officer Marcus, this attorney Wants to get into the evidence room.
uh, this way, please. - Thank you.
so, this is everything?
all the evidence from the case?
everything from the jewelry store is right here.
was there anything else you were looking for?
well, where's this ring? This one, she's wearing in the picture?
let me see.
it's not here.
maybe the body was released to the family With the ring still on it.
so, she was buried with it?
it's a pretty nice ring.
maybe an officer stole it.
there's a few dirtbags on the force.
generally it's a good department, but...
do you know the detective on this case?
sure, I know him.
is he one of the dirtbags?
he's the king dirtbag.
Hi, daddy. I made goalie.
there were six girls trying out, And they only picked two.
and i got it!
daddy, Julia took my scrapbook.
I didn't take it. She lost it.
yes you did! - No I didn't.
I want to come home.
we are home. Sorry, daddy.
Bye, daddy! We love you.
we love you, daddy.
call us back. - Call us back!
Hello?
it's Jamie Sawyer.
Oh, geez.
I need to talk to you.
Oh, Jamie, it's late.
it'll only take a minute.
I'm standing at your door.
what?
can I come in?
hell no.
Why?
you having a date?
you know, I'm gonna kill whoever told you where I live.
real estate transactions are public record.
all right, well, you got three minutes.
although I don't know why you'd want to buy a dump like this.
a deepwater dock, so I can have a real boat.
now you have two and a half minutes.
McCandless is harassing my client's girlfriend.
offering to change his testimony in return for sex.
your mayor wants to appoint me city attorney.
that's great, Roy. That's really good for you.
being ADA sucks.
especially with you around all the time.
perfect. So you can just drop the case against Deshaun,
and get on with your next gig.
Jamie, I'm not dropping the case.
I mean, Carrie Baker was murdered.
not by Deshaun.
that detective's credibility is totally impeached.
then maybe Brenda cooked up the harassment thing
to help Deshaun get a mistrial down the road.
I saw them together. - Maybe she wanted you to see them.
you drive me crazy.
the feeling is mutual.
how come I never see you sweat?
I'm sweating right now.
in little private places you can't see.
don't you wish we could just...
have a beer together?
like two regular people?
when this case is finished,
I am coming right over there with a six-Pack.
and you better not like that european beer, 'Cause I ain't bringing that.
I'll see you in court, Roy.
did you talk to that woman lawyer?
I helped her in the evidence room.
don't tell her nothing about me or about us.
you understand?
I'll tell her whatever I want.
don't fight me, Lee Anne, Or next time I cuff you,
you'll wish it was a game.
Hey, counselor.
Hey, detective.
well, this isn't our regular night.
I know, I just needed to talk to someone without a southern accent.
well, you called the right guy.
you look... good.
so do you.
you got a guy in your department named Mccandless?
that why you called me?
to work me for the 411?
no.
you got any?
you're something else.
Yeah, Terry Mccandless.
real good ol' boy.
Knox loves his ex-Marines,
but he, uh, promoted this kid too fast.
he's already messed up two cases 'Cause he's just...
arrogant.
look, Jamie, I don't want to be Your inside man in the department.
I'd rather just be your booty call than that.
you're not my booty call.
Really?
Really? I'm not?
you know what I mean.
you're more than that. - I know what you mean.
got your coffee and a biscuit.
you in court today?
no. One of the jurors in Deshaun's case got a personal day.
you find out where Carrie Baker's buried?
she wasn't buried. She was cremated.
where are the ashes?
in the columbarium at Cypress Grove.
what the hell's a columbarium?
Oh, I love it when I know something you don't know.
it's one of those buildings with all the drawers in the walls where they keep people's ashes.
I'm gonna need a court order for those ashes.
I want to find that ring.
I can get you an order.
but it might not be from the court.
I didn't hear that.
you wanted to see me, Deputy Knox?
close the door.
lee Anne, you're a good officer, and I am more than happy to write glowing recommendations to any department you ever apply to.
but I think it's time for you to move on.
Why?
you know why.
please, sir, I... I can't get fired.
well, you should have thought of that before you started sending photos of yourself to fellow officers on department e-mail.
what about Terry? Does he get fired?
McCandless has been reprimanded.
but you are a bad influence in this department.
me? He is just as...
I'm giving you an opportunity to walk away with a clean record.
I'll need your badge.
and your gun.
you're gonna regret this.
thank you.
sorry, Carrie.
topaz and diamonds melt?
no, the gems were fake.
so, let's say Carrie is making and selling jewelry with fake gems.
then she sells the real gems.
it gives her double the money, double the profit.
but why does she even go through the motions of buying the jewels in the first place?
to keep it a secret... from Helen.
I think I'll talk to Helen again.
miss Sawyer?
I think I need an attorney.
who would have thought your soon to be ex-father-in-law would become your best buddy?
right?
Yeah, city attorney.
you remember when your dad thought you were such a screw-up, he refused to pay for law school?
uh, guess he thought wrong.
I like the new place.
thank you.
so, uh, how are Susie and the kids?
they're great.
boys always ask after Julia and Marie.
when are they coming for a visit?
well...
supposed to see them every other weekend, but I hate this for you, Roy.
I mean, I'm fine. I just...
miss my girls.
Yeah.
listen, when you're city attorney, there's something coming down the pike you might need to deal with.
I had to fire an officer, a female officer, and she's complaining to the equal employment commission.
she have a case?
Nope. I mean, this woman was not harassed.
anything that happened was purely consensual.
we have e-mails, texts sent on department cell phones...
all right, well, I'm gonna need to see all that, so just forward it to me, all right?
well, you don't want me to do that.
how many are there?
I came to see Helen.
she's not here.
uh, everything all right?
Yeah, I just have a few questions.
are these your paintings?
Yes. I'm taking over the studio.
Oh. Nice.
do you mind if I look?
Oh, please.
I'll get you a catalogue.
it's Carrie if you're wondering.
she modeled for you?
Yes.
does Helen know about this painting?
I don't want her to know.
I messed up. I hooked up with Carrie. It was nothing.
did the police ever question you?
I mean, what's your next question... what's my alibi?
I was with my buddies down at the ice house till 2: 00 A.M. or so.
you can ask them. - Oh, I will.
the judge gave us a recess, but we have to work fast.
check out Kenny and his alibi and get on the road today.
how much road are we talking about?
we have to find out if Kenny's involved in the whole jewel scheme with Carrie.
I want you to hit every gold and gem shop in the county if you have to.
show 'em a picture of Carrie. Kenny, too.
find out if either of them were fencing any jewels.
it might have gotten her killed.
you stole this?
I borrowed it.
you would have made a good criminal.
I'm saving my gas receipts.
Jamie, you have a minute?
sure.
are you taking on the case of Lee Anne Marcus versus the Charleston police department?
how do you know about that?
well, I know a lot of people.
look, I'd like you to come by my place tonight.
I got something to show you. Shall we say 9: 00?
you seen these folks around here?
still ain't seen 'em?
it's four-alarm hot out there.
you seen this gal around here in the last year or two selling gems?
no, I ain't seen her.
how about this fella?
Look-look, we ain't supposed to talk about our customers.
Oh, I understand, honey.
but just so you know...
I'm running out of these.
I ain't seen him...
but I seen her.
every other Friday.
one of our best customers.
you're gonna let me in this time?
to the left.
what's all this about?
just watch.
Oh. Where did you get this?
deputy chief.
Oh, and right there.
or a bump. Let me rewind there.
there's like a...
a cut or something. Right there. You see that?
I mean, it's probably missing footage, or, you know, something they're trying to hide.
so, what do you think?
I think we need that beer now.
do you think they sit around watching that video?
I mean, someone was shooting it.
then, maybe that's the person who's getting off on it.
did you?
did I what?
get off on it?
Oh, did you?
I asked you first.
all right, well, if I answer this question totally honestly...
will you answer one from me totally honestly?
deal.
all right, well, the video is...
it's all right, but...
sitting there watching, next to you was, um...
Yeah.
why did your wife divorce you?
well, Nina likes money.
and he's rich. Like...
private-jet rich.
so here's my question.
you got a boyfriend?
why do you care?
you know, the gentleman thing with me...
it's not an act.
I do. Have a boyfriend.
he's a homicide detective. Maybe you know him.
sure, I know him.
well...
he is a lucky guy.
better get going.
Yeah.
evening, ma'am. Would you mind stepping out of the car for us?
I wasn't speeding.
step out of the car, please.
what's this about?
well, you were driving a little erratically back there.
uh, no, I wasn't.
you know I wasn't.
what do we have here? - Four cops for a speeding ticket?
what, do you call out the SWAT team if I run a red light?
Hey. Hey! You don't have a warrant!
is there something in here we need a warrant for?
no.
well, lookie here.
Oh, my... this is ridiculous.
well, at least you don't have to call a lawyer.
get her in the car.
this is a setup. - Ma'am, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
if you can't afford an attorney, one will be provided for you...
Hey. Babe, I'm sorry this took so long, you know?
I know. I'm just happy to see you.
thank you.
let's go. You want to come to my house?
I got to go home. I got to be in court in an hour.
Hey, brother, you got something for me to sign?
Yeah, right here, Terry.
Thanks.
have you ever seen this ring, Ms. Barnes?
of course. My partner made it.
restate for the record this is the ring Detective McCandless found in my client's pocket, a ring he said the victim made for his girlfriend.
can you identify the precious gems in this ring?
those are sapphires and that's a diamond.
thank you.
now, what happens to precious gems when they are exposed to fire?
nothing.
so...
what will happen to this ring in the fire? Will it be harmed?
I'm... not an expert. I'm just a businesswoman.
diamonds don't burn. Or melt.
the effect the fire had on this ring is proof that the so-called gems in the setting are fakes, nothing but paste.
did you know the jewels were fake?
of course not. - Really?
because I have an affidavit from a gentleman in Greenville who says you've been coming in every other Friday for a year to sell him loose gems.
objection, your honor.
overruled. - Did Carrie find out you were switching her gems?
is that why you went to the studio that night?
Objection! - Sustained.
ms. Sawyer... - Or is it because you found out she was sleeping with your boyfriend?
ms. Sawyer! Order!
ms. Sawyer, Mr. Rayder, please approach.
ms. Barnes, you may step down.
now, I don't know how they run their courtrooms up in Chicago or New York, but down here, we don't allow our attorneys to play Perry Mason.
who's Perry Mason?
all right, look, what have you actually got on this witness?
I've got phone bills and shipping receipts signed by Helen to a company in Mexico who manufactures counterfeit gems.
and I've got two jewelers who will testify in return for immunity that they took the real diamonds out of Carrie's pieces and replaced them with fakes.
Roy...Kind of looks like she's got you bent over a stump with your pants down, son.
what do you want to do?
in light of the new evidence, the state of South Carolina will drop its case against Deshaun Linares.
I want him released immediately.
we can make that happen.
well done, counselor.
must feel good.
Mm. I didn't get much sleep last night.
it is hard to sleep in jail.
your coke possession charge came into the DA's office this morning.
completely fabricated.
I got a firsthand account of how Charleston PD does business.
are you okay? - I'm fine.
news just travels a little too fast for me around here.
well, it's a big place, but a small town.
so, can I give you a ride?
uh, no, I have one.
right.
Hey, baby. - Hi.
they have a tape.
it's footage of you and three other men, including Terry...
having sex on a police car.
that didn't happen.
I've seen it. It's you.
I swear to God, I did... I did not do that.
how can you be in a tape and not know it?
I don't know.
were you ever with a group of them?
all the time. We'd go out for drinks.
he must have slipped something into my beer.
like what? - GHB.
or oxy. It's all over the evidence room.
they brag about the stuff they can get.
so this could have happened one night without you knowing it.
it did happen one night without me knowing, I swear to you.
the cops are saying your involvement in the group sex was consensual.
how could you believe them...
after what they did to you?
I'm in a hurry, dude.
Terry, I'm not your dude. Understand?
I will destroy you, you understand me?
you-you stay away from Jamie Sawyer, or I will destroy you.
are we clear? - Yeah.
good.
you fix that cocaine scheme that you pulled, too, or I will have you demoted so far down the food chain you're gonna have to reach up to grab your nuts, hmm?
you got me? You got me?
Yes, sir. - Good.
ladies and gentlemen of the press, congratulations to our new city attorney.
ms. Marcus will be suing the city of Charleston and the Charleston police department for sexual harassment, wrongful termination and defamation of character.
ms. Marcus!
okay, Jamie, game on.
the missing footage.
check the camera.

Hello, Quinn.
good morning, Quinn.
how's it going, mate?
what's up, guys?
working the late shift, are you?
someone's got to clean up after you guys.
all right, Quinn.
Oi, oi, oi. Come on, then.
you're not havin' one yourself, then?
no. I'm trying to cut back.
you heard from the school, then, didn't you?
down you go.
good night, lads. - See you, Karen.
great work. Have a good weekend.
Oi, Karen, here's the new recruit.
employment office is up top.
Hi, Mum!
Quinn, how are you, mate?
have you been smoking?
no, I told you. I only smoke when I've been drinking.
what's wrong?
nothing.
Quinn, what is it?
you've got something you want to show me.
you know what it says.
scholarship was worth $3, 000 a year.
we don't have that sort of money.
maybe we could ask Dad to pay.
sorry.
Karen?
what?
got a problem at number 4.
Jess says he's hit some sort of a void.
Oh, that bitch hasn't a clue to what she's doing.
Hey, Quinn.
and what brings you to the arsehole of the world?
you're passing through it. What's that make you?
ha.
here.
why don't you go inside and have a wee look?
wicked.
I know it's still... - Well, I covered it.
what... Quinn!
mum, there's something in there.
there's something in the hole!
damn it, Jess!
it's unsafe conditions!
here. Let's look at this void.
it's unsafe!
I'm just going to wash your eyes out, okay?
mum, we've got to go!
no, no. We've got to do this fast.
open your eyes. Open them up. Open them.
give me that.
come on!
get in!
mum, there was something in there!
come here!
come on! Come on!
mum!
mum?
mum?
mum?
Quinn: I've kept this for years, because someday it will be up to you.
I don't want you to be afraid.
I want you to understand.
knowledge is the only weapon we've got left.
in the beginning, it was ignorance that destroyed us.
I saw the first...
but soon the world saw millions.
no one knew how they spawned so fast.
they swarmed like locusts, burning everything in their path, driven by one purpose...
to feed.
even then, we couldn't believe they were real.
ancient man had made them into myths, but nature had made something far more terrible.
too late, our scientists discovered their true identity...
a species which had burned the dinosaurs to dust, whose ash had brought on ice ages, who, in eons past...
had scorched the world clean of life,
then starved, then slept...
waiting for the earth to replenish itself, - Woman: 5, 4, 3,... - waiting to start their cycle anew.
...2, 1. - Our weapons shot fire back at them, yet for every one of them killed, a hundred took its place.
they seemed invulnerable.
we could only look on as our leaders...
used their greatest arsenal to destroy them.
but in the end, we only helped them, till the world burned and the few of us that were left fled the cities, found shelter where we could.
you have to understand our past because you will decide our future.
they're starving now, and they're more dangerous than ever.
but we have to go on.
we have to outlast them.
only one species is getting out of this alive.
man: Hey, Quinn!
come and have a look at this!
it's a straight drop now from the water tower.
you just pull the plug, 500 gallons per minute hits the walls.
don't care about the specs, Jerry.
1, 200 centigrade, can it take it?
Yeah. Course it can.
remember, I used to build blast furnaces for a living.
I know all about fire.
of course you do. Sorry, mate.
nice one.
Eddie's gone psycho.
Jared? - Yeah, Quinn?
keep 'em at it. No slacking!
you heard him. No slacking.
go!
man: I shall always walk.
Yeah, though his brethren rose like locusts from the Earth, Quinn, - Yeah. - No weapon could save me!
Yeah. Excuse me. - No fire could extinguish theirs!
Cheers, mate. - They will prepare...
what's up, Quinn?
what are you doing, Eddie?
me and a few others, we're going harvesting, Quinn.
no, you're not.
it's not ready. We spoke about this.
half the stuff's not ripe. You pick it now, it won't germinate.
that means no seeds. That means nothing to plant next season.
there won't be a next season. We'll be starved to death.
what is this? We can do it, Eddie.
we decided, all of us, you as well...
...dig in, work together, outlast them.
kids can't eat hope, Quinn. Edinburgh's gone.
we haven't heard from Pembury or Norwich in two years!
we're on our own, Quinn.
Yeah, we know that.
that's why we have to hang on. Maybe we are all that's left.
eight years I've listened to you, and for what?
two kids and a wife buried on the road.
I'm not losing these, Quinn, not when there's food out there.
sorry, Eddie.
you're not going anywhere.
give me the keys. - You bloody take 'em from me.
it's a community, not a prison.
Eddie, you can argue as much as you like.
it makes no difference.
the point is, if you go out those gates, then you jeopardize this community...
you can stay out there, because you're not coming back.
all right.
I'm keeping these.
Hey, Quinn.
you know, I'm your best friend, and sometimes even I don't like you.
sorry.
join me, "the black knight says," then we can end this conflict forever.
Never!
"I'll never join you," the white knight says.
you killed my father.
Creedy!
the black knight stares through the holes in his shiny mask, and he speaks words that burn into our hero's heart forever.
I am your father.
No!
did you make that up, Mr. Quinn?
course I did.
all right, kids. Time for bed.
No! - One more!
tomorrow. No, no. Prayers first.
the Shark! - Tomorrow!
the Lion King! - Yeah!
tomorrow! Prayers first!
okay.
ready?
what do we do when we wake?
all: Keep both eyes on the sky.
what do we do when we sleep?
all: Keep one eye on the sky.
what do we do when we see them?
all: Dig hard, dig deep, run for shelter, and never look back.
well done.
good night, guys.
bedtime.
bedtime!
good night.
boy: Why can't we stay up later?
Michael?
Quinn's asleep.
I took the keys.
let's go.
you keep quiet.
Hello, Liam.
willem says it's dragon breath.
don't you listen to him. It's just the wind.
okay.
Oh, God.
Ajay, alarm.
take cover, kids. Come on, now.
there we go, then.
okay, children!
head up! One at a time!
1, 2, ...
single file. Single file.
let's go!
Michael, let's move!
right.
move the kids. Let's go. Come on.
Creedy? - Yeah?
you got a count? - Yeah. We're good.
woman: Quinn!
Quinn!
in the field.
dragons!
go get Eddie.
Rachel!
Rachel!
I'm here!
Devon!
Devon!
Devon! - Michael!
dad...
Where's Michael? - Michael?
Michael! Michael!
you okay?
Where's Matt? - He's dead.
Eddie!
let's go! Move!
come on! Go! - Come on, Michael!
go! Move!
keep going! Come on!
dad w-what'll we do?
we're trapped!
come on!
go!
move it! - Hurry up!
go! Come on! Quick!
get in there! Get in!
go, go, go...
you okay?
Devon!
come on, Creedy. Come on, Creedy!
it's gonna blow up! - Back up! Back up!
Oh, my God! Back up!
I'm going as fast as I can!
Rachel: Back up! Back up! Back up!
stop! Quinn, stop!
let he bloody go! - No!
let me out, Quinn!
no, Quinn!
let me... - No, you can't...
stop! Quinn!
Devon's there!
Devon!!
Devon!!
he doesn't care about us.
he just wants the damn ash off that field.
Creedy's one-and-only black label, aged two weeks in a steel barrel.
now, the secret's swallowing fast.
that way it just burns your stomach and not your throat.
go on.
sip it and weep.
poor bastard.
who? Eddie?
a father's not meant to bury his kids.
it's supposed to be the other way around.
Yeah, well, he wouldn't have had to if he'd just listened, would he?
no, Creedy. Maybe he was right.
it's easy to square your shoulders and bear it when you don't have kids.
maybe there won't be another harvest.
no. Not now, with half the crop gone.
God knows how we're going to get through.
you remember when we'd go out and bring in 80%, 90% of it?
not anymore.
not in the last few years.
they're hungrier, too.
you're not giving up on me, are you?
no.
I just thought if we could hang on, somehow we'd make it through.
man: This is a national civil defense alert for all who can hear this
man #2: No choice but to authorize the use of nuclear weapons
man: The sole survivor was a 12-year-old boy
man: [ American accent ] Roger that.
I'm going in. Stay high on my twelve...
charge all weapons.
Hey, Barlow, I've got voices.
Ajay, what are you smoking?
I'm not messing with you, Barlow.
take a look.
a look at what?
she's not moving.
forget the bird and use the scope, you wanker.
Oh, dear.
Quinn: Creedy!
Creedy!
I've got to go.
man: All right, lads, this isn't a drill!
move it along!
get those out. One to Creedy.
another one to Jared!
here's Creedy's.
all right, all right! Come on, then! Come on!
extra shells!
come on!
we haven't got all day!
marauders.
years since we've seen them.
well, look on the bright side.
at least we're not alone.
only one thing worse than a dragon
Americans.
Oh, what a dump.
who's in charge?!
well, that would be you, then.
anything happens, you know what to do.
uh, no. I have no idea.
me neither.
that's a big tank.
you responsible for this place?
who are you?
name's Van Zan, Kentucky Irregulars.
you're a long way from home, Van Zan. You lost?
rebuilt a National Guard C5A.
flew it 8, 000 miles on 2 engines and tried to set it down on the old strip outside of Manchester.
lost 122 men and most of my fuel.
we need shelter and a place to refit artillery.
we'll be out of your hair by 1800 hours tomorrow.
that's a good story, especially the bit about the plane, but there hasn't been anything in the air for 20 years.
that's their territory.
it's my territory. It's your territory.
they're just rentin' it.
turn around, Van Zan.
don't be a fool.
we can do this easy...
or we can do it real easy.
you try it.
you ever seen one of these?
not many men have.
got it off the first one I killed.
the plane was better.
so now you're a dragon killer.
that's not even original.
it was in a wheat field just south of Coffeyville, Kansas.
it was late November.
it's a month of mist.
and we were caught in the open.
the sun was setting behind us.
there was nowhere to run.
twice it came in on us, and twice it missed the heart of us.
and that's when I had an epiphany.
you see, they have great vision in the day.
and they have even better vision at night.
but in the failing light, they can't focus.
magic hour.
Coffeyville.
it's etched in American history because the outlaw Dalton boys were killed there.
ordinary townsfolk rose up and took 'em down.
maybe you're the Dalton boys.
no, no.
we're the townsfolk.
you try anything
I'll kill you.
didn't get your name.
Quinn.
well, I'm sure you've got...
a perfectly good explanation for this, but I'm buggered if I know what it is.
he's a dragon slayer.
a what?
he's a dragon slayer!
Oh, he's a dragon slayer.
Oh, good.
and I suppose that makes you King Arthur, does it?
christ Almighty, Quinn.
I mean, even if you believe that, and you'd have to be an imbecile,
do you not think we'd be easy meat for these guys?
you weren't there.
look at this guy. Look. Look.
I mean, he looks like... like a... like a rogue Marine.
you remember those guys? Oh, yeah, sure.
they blew up plenty of dragons in their time,...
but they also took half the world...
you weren't there! I saw his eyes, Creedy!
man: Move it! Move it! Move it!
great job.
we ran a 30-mile grid in every direction... nothing.
could be on the moon, Denton.
Quinn, this is Alexandra Jensen, U.S. Cavalry.
Oh. Captain Creedy.
how you doin'? Creedy.
Denton Van Zan.
how are you?
excuse me.
who are they?
archangels.
huh?
17 seconds once they jump from the chopper, that's their life expectancy.
you never thought of giving them parachutes?
they're not much help. They're bulla men.
what?
they were used by gladiators to snare other men.
not men, dragons.
so, you guys,...
jump out the chopper and use a net to snare dragons?
ha. I mean, sure, yeah.
I mean..., you would, wouldn't you?
three watches, eight hours each.
all the kids in the shelter.
rifles on the keep and walls.
excuse me.
aren't you forgetting who let them in?
don't mean I trust 'em.
all right, guys.
I just brewed a fresh pot, if that's what you're looking for.
a whetstone, actually.
sure.
is that your son?
no. Got him from the pound.
hmm. Is that where you get all your children?
I found him in a village near Bray.
3 years old, sitting with his mum.
he kept trying to wake her up.
she had been dead for days.
we were making our way up here, a few of us - me, Creedy, and Barlow.
no idea how we were gonna survive.
anyway, I grabbed him.
what else was I gonna do?
leave him.
most men would have especially back in the early years.
everybody's just running for their lives.
Yeah. Well, I didn't.
regretted it ever since, of course.
what are you doing here?
what do you want?
you want to know anything, you ask Van Zan.
get on the roof, go to south wall.
watch out the kids.
Goosh, you alive?!
not even close, Denton.
Alex! Radios are down!
cover the east ridge and tell me what you see!
men, get ready to rock 'n' roll!
we got a dragon to kill!
Goosh, set the triangulators! - Roger that!
Tito, Mead, Piscatella, bounce your butts!
move out!
Alex, what do you see?
no sign of it.
visibility is about 3 miles on the deck.
Roger that.
stay on the deck till I get the verticals up.
copy that, Van Zan.
waiting for triangulator. Safety first, guys.
Safety?! What part of this job do you find safe?!
it's not you I'm worried about. It's my chopper.
Oh. Cold. Ha ha ha ha!
first vertical's up.
vertical 1 up, Alex.
copy that.
second vertical is up.
second vertical is up, Alex.
now, once I have radar, you go to 5, 000 feet.
fly directly back above my location.
Gideon, you and the boys bring that bitch right down on my head,...
... and I'll take it from there.
copy that, Van Zan.
Alvarez, you're the bait.
Jefferson, you and I are the gunners.
we don't open our chutes...
... until you give us confirmation that it's down, right?
bogey on our tail, 200 yards!
go, go, go, go! - Roger!
I'll try to lose it up in the clouds.
Piscatella, do you read me?
van Zan: God damn it, Piscatella! Get your vertical up!
come on, number 3! Piscatella, that's you!
Piscatella: I'm almost there!
I'm almost at the top of the...
God damn it, Piscatella. Come in.
ajay?
can you hear anything?
van Zan's trying to take it on, Quinn, using some kind of 3D mapping device.
if they don't get that third vertical up,
Alex is flying blind.
come on!
van Zan, what's going on?
I'm at altitude. We're blind up here.
can you give me some time?
I'm having trouble with the third vertical.
van Zan: Come on, number 3! Piscatella, that's you!
get your vertical up!
all right, Piscatella.
third vertical's up.
Alex, we have visual.
monitor's coming up.
shit!
hold on!
Alvarez!
it's right on him! It's right on him!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
damn it!
talk to me, Alex!
angels are flying.
Alex, do you have a reading?!
okay. Target - 1,500 feet.
copy that.
Alvarez, do you have a visual?!
negative.
damn it! It's right on top of me! Shoot!
shoot at what?! I can't see a thing!
nets away!
great shot!
all right, Jefferson! Fly out!
Roger that.
Alvarez, can you see it?
negative. I think it's down.
copy that.
shit! Alex, both nets just flew right by me.
Alvarez, can you confirm that it is down?
copy that!
negative! It's on me!
Jefferson, I'm not getting any contact with Alvarez.
keep your eyes open.
Roger that.
Jefferson, look out! - Oh, my God...
Alex: Gideon's down.
Piscatella.
Piscatella, do you read me?
van Zan.
who is this?
Quinn.
Quinn, where's Piscatella?
he's gone.
are you ready to ride?
cause you got about 30 seconds till the bitch is on top of you.
you bring her to me.
you're the bait, Quinn, 1, 600 pounds of horseflesh.
ride her right down my throat. Do you read me?
ride the north road to the quarry.
bring her to me, Quinn.
I'm coming.
hmm? Here we go.
okay. Okay.
come on!
line up 20 yards south by southwest!
1, 200 yards.
wind velocity... 10. 2 north by northwest.
Yeah, this is really good stuff. Thanks.
Hey, good day, Quinn, yeah? Got a new fool
all right, Quinn. I'd like to laugh at
hats off to you, mate.
envy the country that has heroes, huh?!
I say pity the country that needs 'em.
what are you celebrating?
one dragon down, three men dead? Oh, yeah.
at that rate, we might just be getting somewhere in about 320 years.
is that what you want?
you want a little accommodation?
these beasts live on ash.
they feed on death.
there's no middle ground not for them, not for us.
and sure as hell not for my men who died out there today.
but you go ahead.
have your little soiree.
personally, you disgust me.
we bury our dead at dawn.
what are you doing here, Quinn?
you're standing on ground where I've buried hundreds.
this is my home.
I'm asking the questions.
what are you doing here?
I lead, you follow.
I kept these for you.
they sent them off proud, Alex.
Alex is the keeper of the dead, Quinn.
she's our memory.
when this thing is over, she's gonna build a wall with those things.
and, unfortunately, it's gonna be a very long wall.
I'm out of resources, Quinn.
I'm out of men.
Alex, tell him.
did you see the one we brought down, the big bull?
Yeah.
well, it wasn't. It was a female.
there was at least one egg, probably more.
we've hit over 200 of them, and as far as we can tell, they're all females.
how about you, Quinn? You ever seen a male?
I don't know.
when I'm running for my life, I don't stop to look at the plumbing.
well, we have.
Alex discovered it about two years back.
she worked out how the fire in the glands...
two glands in the mouth secrete separate chemicals, yep.
that's right.
combine in exhalation - Nitro-Napalm.
Yeah. Well, the chemical engineer is dead now.
that was his theory.
we figure they're like fish.
the females spawn the eggs.
one male passes over and fertilizes thousands.
did you hear what she said, Quinn?
one male.
that's why we never see any others, 'cause there's only one.
now, we tracked the epidemiology of these things, and we found out where they're from.
and that is why we're here.
we kill the male, we kill the species.
we're going to London.
good luck. It's that way.
no, I need soldiers.
Quinn, are you listening to me? I need men...
men from Pembury went to London.
and maybe she's right, because they disturbed something.
90 of them died, and then it backtracked them to their fortress.
and you haven't seen destruction like that, Van Zan not even in this world.
so we walk over dead men...
not with my people, you won't!
I've got a castle full of them.
I'm trying to keep them alive.
you're just letting them die slower.
I said no.
I made a mistake letting you through those gates.
I saw something in your eyes. I thought it was awe. I was wrong.
it's madness. You're insane.
and I want you out before you do more damage.
look out the window.
eden's not burning. It's burnt.
why don't you want to go?
what happened there?
my mother was working on a railway tunnel - project engineer.
she died there, okay?
you've seen it, haven't you?
Quinn!
trouble.
there's nothing magical about 'em.
they're made up of a collection of organs.
they have a mind, a heart, and a liver.
you take out one of these, you bring down the beast!
is that it? Four of you?
Eddie.
Eddie, what you doin'?
you got kids, man.
that's why I'm going, Creedy. That's why.
the volunteer section of this campaign's now over. It's time for the draft.
Tito, Mead...
get the six strongest men they have and load 'em up.
right. - Got it.
dig your own holes. Die in 'em.
Oi!
I said no!
no, Quinn!
get out of my way, Quinn.
okay, okay.
get him off!
I'll kill ya!... - Stop! Van Zan! Stop it!
I'll kill ya!...
that's what we need. - I 'll kill ya!
he's gonna bring it back here!
man: All right.
all right, he's had enough.
go, London!
come on! Move 'em out!
come on! Grab those guys!
you, you, you!
he would have killed you.
he doesn't feel things.
that's the only way he can do what he does.
here. Take this.
iodine.
hurts like hell, but it kills anything.
good luck, Quinn.
you too busy to say goodbye?
you're not my father.
you can't stop me, Quinn.
I can be an archangel.
Gideon says he'll teach me.
17 seconds.
did he tell you that's how long they live?
not the good ones. Gideon's an 8-year veteran.
at least they're still killing them.
a couple of years, Jared.
that's all I'm asking for. Give me that.
after that, you'll be old enough, and you can lead 'em.
that's what I want. Out of everyone, you're the best.
it's a waste of time, Quinn - all of it.
you're right. I'm not your father.
I can't lock you in. I can't make you stay.
and if you think you're man enough to speak like that, then I guess you're man enough to go.
goodbye, Jared.
you look after yourself.
that dragon smells like shit.
are you gonna burn it?
I love it.
they hate the smell of their dead.
it's the only thing that scares 'em.
it might buy us a couple of days.
sorry, Quinn.
so am I.
this time I was thinking I got rid of you for sure.
Alex: Van Zan, what are we doing?
do you see a way through?
negative. It's blocked for miles.
as far as the river, Denton.
head back, Alex.
find me a way around.
copy.
is this Pembury?
this looks like Pembury.
do you want to turn back?
nukes must have done this.
nukes didn't do this.
should we set the triangulators?
no time.
man the 50-cal, lock and load, cut the engines, and take your positions.
you heard him! Lock and load!
let's move! Let's move!
I think it's playing with us.
it's not playing with us.
it's setting us up.
easy. Easy.
easy, girl.
van Zan, it's Alex. Can you read me?
van Zan, can you hear me?
van Zan, if you can hear me, I'm coming back.
can anybody hear me?
van Zan!
van Zan!
van Zan!
Denton what happened?
it was him.
where are the soldiers?
one pass.
he flew over just once.
the castle.
get the hell out of there!
take cover, everybody!
get it moving!
anybody upstairs?!
Jared!
Creedy! - Quinn!
have you got them all?
boy: Creedy, help!
I'll get him! You take her downstairs!
hurry up! Quinn!
that thing won't stop until it's killed us all!
Katie... she won't move.
come on, Katie.
Willem, well done. Get on my shoulder.
Katie, come on. Let go of the wall.
let go. Let go!
take her! Take her!
everybody, move to the back!
I've got all the kids. Okay, keep pushing up.
Katie's blanket.
where is everyone?!
don't you go up there, Quinn!
there's 65 people up there, Creedy. I'm going!
God damn it, Quinn.
don't you dare leave! It's too dangerous!
I'll clean it up.
Creedy!
Noooo!
Creedy! Ahh!
No!
No!
Creedy!... - Creedy!...
what do we do when we wake?
all: Keep both eyes on the sky.
what do we do
what do we
what do we do when we sleep?
all: Keep one eye on the sky.
women: What do we do when we see him?
all: Dig hard, dig deep, run for shelter, and never look back.
Jared
we're alive!
we're in here!
push!
back away!
you were right.
I salvaged what I could from your armory.
we got one rifle, two automatics, two crossbows, and explosive heads.
you, me, and Alex...
down the coast in the chopper.
stay tight to the cliffs.
the Thames will take us right into the heart of London.
I know where he lives.
magic hour...
...you say that's when they're the weakest.
we'll see.
you're going home.
Jared!
Yeah, Quinn?
you keep them safe.
well, this town's gone to hell.
they must have heard us coming.
what's stopping them?
it's not us.
either way, we gotta get in there.
come on, guys. We're outnumbered hundreds to 3.
they know this city from the sky down, and I know it from the bottom up.
if we can get in quiet, I can sneak us into some tunnels.
that should get us close.
good Christ.
did he see us?
they must be starving.
they're eating their own.
Oh, we're dead.
look on the bright side.
now we've got him outnumbered 3 to 1.
now you ready?
Yeah.
Quinn
you lead. We follow.
there's an underground passage...
...leads to the construction site!
down here!
clear.
four tunnels meet at this shaft.
leads up to a square. There used to be buildings up there.
if they're still around, could be good coverage.
Yeah, if it goes to the street, that's what we take.
Alex, give me the sticks.
Quinn, these are highly volatile heads.
you fire them with your crossbow.
now, when you...
he knows we're here. Shh.
okay.
how tall is that shaft?
150 feet.
all right. Here's the plan...
when we get to street level, we gotta bring that bull's ass to the ground, and I'm gonna take care of that.
now, one shot's gonna kill him, and it's gonna be with this.
he only exposes his chest before he breathes fire.
now, these are magnesium-tip C-4 arrows, and they only fly about 50 feet.
so, when you fire, you gotta be standing in the furnace.
so do not hesitate. If you do, we die.
Ah, he's playing hide-and-seek.
more like cat and mouse.
Quinn!
use it!
Oh, he's eating it up.
I can't see a damn thing, Quinn.
what am I looking at?
this is an enclosed square. It's about 100 meters across.
there's a building right in the middle.
that chimney looks down over the lot of it.
what do you think?
I don't know yet.
hey you scared?
no.
it was your idea to come to London.
Yeah, I thought I'd be at 3, 500 feet.
Yeah, I thought I'd have over 200 men with me right now.
life's got a funny way of turning out different, though, don't it?
Yeah.
Yeah. - Yeah.
see that railcar?
it'll give us a better view.
move.
drop your packs - weapons only.
okay, we're gonna have a window...
10, maybe 12 seconds every time he makes a turn, and we're gonna use it.
how?
we're gonna split up.
we stay together, take a hit, and we're gone, so we gotta use every angle.
now, Quinn, you're gonna take that west wall.
don't lock and load till you get there. You got it?
okay. What about you?
I got the north.
Alex, I need you to stay right here.
now, when Quinn and I make a move, it's gonna draw him off, and I don't think the son of a bitch can count.
now, he's gonna make another turn.
when he does, I'm gonna tell you to go.
you're gonna run like hell to that east wall. Don't think about it...
it's water!
Yeah. Keep it. You're gonna need it.
we have paid a terrible price.
and now we got a chance to make a difference.
we will.
now, that's our first window.
Quinn
move!
the arrows.
Alex!
in about 8 seconds, we're gonna have a window!
now, when I tell you to go, you run like hell straight to the base of this chimney!
are you ready?!
go! Go!
go!
run like the wind, baby!
come on, big boy!
that's right.
Quinn!
Alex!
stop!
I'm fine.
what are we gonna do?
I lost the explosives.
we're gonna find 'em.
run!
keep going!
go around the other side!
I'll slow him down!
he's not moving. He's waiting for us.
Quinn, by the truck - the arrow.
by the wheel.
No!
die!
he always thought you could do it.
and you did.
come on.
Quinn! Quinn! Quinn!
we got a signal! Quinn!
we got a signal.
well, what's the problem?
they're speaking French.
well, don't come to me. I'm lousy at French.
they want to speak to the person in charge.
well, that would be you, then.
just keep 'em talking.
get us a good bottle of wine or something.
go on, now.
Thanks, Quinn.
go on, all of you.
all right. Cheers. - Well done!
you think it'll last?
I don't know.
it's been, what, three months since we saw the last one?
if they come, they'll burn, we'll build.
or maybe I'll just kill 'em.
and here I thought optimism was against your nature.
it's a recent development.
well, here's to evolution.

Hello, Quinn.
good morning, Quinn.
how's it going, mate?
what's up, guys?
working the late shift, are you?
someone's got to clean up after you guys.
all right, Quinn.
come on, then.
you're not havin' one yourself, then?
no. I'm trying to cut back.
you heard from the school, then, didn't you?
down you go.
good night, lads. -See you, Karen.
great work. Have a good weekend.
Hi, Karen, here's the new recruit.
employment office is up top.
Hi, Mum!
Quinn, how are you, mate?
have you been smoking?
no, I told you. I only smoke when I've been drinking.
what's wrong?
nothing.
Quinn, what is it?
you've got something you want to show me.
you know what it says.
scholarship was worth $3, 000 a year.
we don't have that sort of money.
maybe we could ask Dad to pay.
sorry.
Karen?
what?
got a problem at number 4.
Jess says he's hit some sort of a void.
Oh, that bitch hasn't a clue to what she's doing.
Hey, Quinn.
and what brings you to the arsehole of the world?
you're passing through it. What's that make you?
ha.
here.
why don't you go inside and have a wee look?
wicked.
I know it's still... -Well, I covered it.
what... Quinn!
mum, there's something in there.
there's something in the hole!
damn it, Jess!
it's unsafe conditions!
here. Let's look at this void.
it's unsafe!
I'm just going to wash your eyes out, okay?
mum, we've got to go!
no, no. We've got to do this fast.
open your eyes. Open them up. Open them.
give me that.
come on!
get in!
mum, there was something in there!
come here!
come on! Come on!
mum!
mum?
mum?
mum?
Quinn: I've kept this for years, because someday it will be up to you.
I don't want you to be afraid.
I want you to understand.
knowledge is the only weapon we've got left.
in the beginning, it was ignorance that destroyed us.
I saw the first,...
but soon the world saw millions.
no one knew how they spawned so fast.
they swarmed like locusts, burning everything in their path, driven by one purpose...
to feed.
even then, we couldn't believe they were real.
ancient man had made them into myths, but nature had made something far more terrible.
too late, our scientists discovered their true identity...
a species which had burned the dinosaurs to dust, whose ash had brought on ice ages, who, in eons past,...
had scorched the world clean of life,
then starved, then slept,...
waiting for the Earth to replenish itself, -Woman: 5, 4, 3,... -waiting to start their cycle anew.
...2, 1. -Our weapons shot fire back at them, yet for every one of them killed, a hundred took its place.
they seemed invulnerable.
we could only look on as our leaders used their greatest arsenal to destroy them.
but in the end, we only helped them, till the world burned and the few of us that were left fled the cities, found shelter where we could.
you have to understand our past because you will decide our future.
they're starving now, and they're more dangerous than ever.
but we have to go on.
we have to outlast them.
only one species is getting out of this alive.
man: Hey, Quinn!
come and have a look at this!
it's a straight drop now from the water tower.
you just pull the plug, 500 gallons per minute hits the walls.
don't care about the specifics, Jerry.
1, 200 centigrade, can it take it?
Yeah. Course it can.
remember, I used to build blast furnaces for a living.
I know all about fire.
of course you do. Sorry, mate.
nice one.
Eddie's gone psycho.
Jerry? -Yeah, Quinn?
keep 'em at it. No slacking!
you heard him. No slacking.
go!
man: I shall always walk.
Yeah, though his brethren rose Like locusts from the Earth, Quinn, -Yeah. -no weapon could save me!
Yeah. Excuse me. -No fire could extinguish theirs!
Cheers, mate. -They will prepare...
what's up, Quinn?
what are you doing, Eddie?
me and a few others, we're going harvesting, Quinn.
no, you're not.
it's not ready. We spoke about this.
half the stuff's not ripe. You pick it now, it won't germinate.
that means no seeds. That means nothing to plant next season.
there won't be a next season. We'll be starved to death.
what is this? We can do it, Eddie.
we decided, all of us, you as well...
...dig in, work together, outlast them.
kids can't eat hope, Quinn. Edinburgh's gone.
we haven't heard from Pembury or Norwich in two years!
we're on our own, Quinn.
Yeah, we know that.
that's why we have to hang on. Maybe we are all that's left.
eight years I've listened to you, and for what?
two kids and a wife buried on the road.
I'm not losing these, Quinn, not when there's food out there.
sorry, Eddie.
you're not going anywhere.
give me the keys. -You bloody take 'em from me.
it's a community, not a prison.
Eddie, you can argue as much as you like.
it makes no difference.
the point is, if you go out those gates, then you jeopardize this community...
you can stay out there, because you're not coming back.
all right.
I'm keeping these.
Hey, Quinn.
you know, I'm your best friend, and sometimes even I don't like you.
sorry.
join me," the black knight says, "then we can end this conflict forever.
Never!
I'll never join you," the white knight says.
you killed my father.
Creedy!
the black knight stares through the holes in his shiny mask, and he speaks words that burn into our hero's heart forever.
I am your father.
No!
did you make that up, Mr. Quinn?
course I did.
all right, kids. Time for bed.
No! -One more!
tomorrow. No, no. Prayers first.
the Shark! -Tomorrow!
the Lion King"! -Yeah!
tomorrow! Prayers first!
okay.
ready?
what do we do when we wake?
all: Keep both eyes on the sky.
what do we do when we sleep?
all: Keep one eye on the sky.
what do we do when we see them?
all: Dig hard, dig deep, run for shelter, and never look back.
well done.
good night, guys.
bedtime.
bedtime!
good night.
boy: Why can't we stay up later?
Michael?
Quinn's asleep.
I took the keys.
let's go.
you keep quiet.
Hello, Liam.
Willam says it's dragon breath.
don't you listen to him. It's just the wind.
okay.
Oh, God.
Ajay, alarm.
take cover, kids. Come on, now.
there we go, then.
okay, children!
head up! One at a time!
1, 2, ...
single file. Single file.
let's go!
Michael, let's move!
right.
move the kids. Let's go. Come on.
Creedy? -Yeah?
you got a count? -Yeah. We're good.
woman: Quinn!
Quinn!
in the field.
dragons!
go get Eddie.
Rachel!
Rachel!
I'm here!
Devon!
Devon!
Devon! -Michael!
dad...
Where's Michael? -Michael?
Michael! Michael!
you okay?
Where's Matt? -He's dead.
Eddie!
let's go! Move!
come on! Go! -Come on, Michael!
go! Move!
keep going! Come on!
dad w-what'll we do?
we're trapped!
come on!
go!
move it! -Hurry up!
go! Come on! Quick!
get in there! Get in!
go, go, go...
you okay?
Devon!
come on, Creedy. Come on, Creedy!
it's gonna blow up! -Back up! Back up!
Oh, my God! Back up!
I'm going as fast as I can!
Rachel: Back up! Back up! Back up!
stop! Quinn, stop!
let he bloody go! -No!
let me out, Quinn!
no, Quinn!
let me... -No, you can't...
stop! Quinn!
Devon's there!
Devon!!
Devon!!
he doesn't care about us.
he just wants the damn ash off that field.
Creedy's one-and-only black label, aged two weeks in a steel barrel.
now, the secret's swallowing fast.
that way it just burns your stomach and not your throat.
go on.
sip it and weep.
poor bastard.
who? Eddie?
a father's not meant to bury his kids.
it's supposed to be the other way around.
Yeah, well, he wouldn't have had to if he'd just listened, would he?
no, Creedy. Maybe he was right.
it's easy to square your shoulders and bear it when you don't have kids.
maybe there won't be another harvest.
no. Not now, with half the crop gone.
God knows how we're going to get through.
you remember when we'd go out and bring in 80%, 90% of it?
not anymore.
not in the last few years.
they're hungrier, too.
you're not giving up on me, are you?
no.
I just thought if we could hang on, somehow we'd make it through.
man: This is a national civil defense alert for all who can hear this
man #2: no choice but to authorize the use of nuclear weapons
man: The sole survivor was a 12-year-old boy
man: [ American accent ] Roger that.
I'm going in. Stay high on my twelve...
charge all weapons.
Hey, Barlow, I've got voices.
Ajay, what are you smoking?
I'm not messing with you, Barlow.
take a look.
a look at what?
she's not moving.
forget the bird and use the scope, you wanker.
Oh, dear.
Quinn: Creedy!
Creedy!
I've got to go.
man: All right, lads, this isn't a drill!
move it along!
get those out. One to Creedy.
another one to Jerry.
here's Creedy's.
all right, all right! Come on, then! Come on!
extra shells!
come on!
we haven't got all day!
marauders.
years since we've seen them.
well, look on the bright side.
at least we're not alone.
only one thing worse than a dragon
Americans.
Oh, what a dump.
who's in charge?!
well, that would be you, then.
anything happens, you know what to do.
uh, no. I have no idea.
me neither.
that's a big tank.
you responsible for this place?
who are you?
name's Van Zan, Kentucky Irregulars.
you're a long way from home, Van Zan. You lost?
rebuilt a National Guard C5A.
flew it 8, 000 miles on 2 engines and tried to set it down on the old strip outside of Manchester.
lost 122 men and most of my fuel.
we need shelter and a place to refit artillery.
we'll be out of your hair by 1800 hours tomorrow.
that's a good story, especially the bit about the plane, but there hasn't been anything in the air for 20 years.
that's their territory.
it's my territory. It's your territory.
they're just rentin' it.
turn around, Van Zan.
don't be a fool.
we can do this easy...
or we can do it real easy.
you try it.
you ever seen one of these?
not many men have.
got it off the first one I killed.
the plane was better.
so now you're a dragon killer.
that's not even original.
it was in a wheat field just south of Coffeyville, Kansas.
it was late November.
it's a month of mist.
and we were caught in the open.
the sun was setting behind us.
there was nowhere to run.
twice it came in on us, and twice it missed the heart of us.
and that's when I had an epiphany.
you see, they have great vision in the day.
and they have even better vision at night.
but in the failing light, they can't focus.
magic hour.
Coffeyville.
it's etched in American history because the outlaw Dalton boys were killed there.
ordinary townsfolk rose up and took 'em down.
maybe you're the Dalton boys.
no, no.
we're the townsfolk.
you try anything
I'll kill you.
didn't get your name.
Quinn.
well, I'm sure you've got...
a perfectly good explanation for this, but I'm buggered if I know what it is.
he's a dragon slayer.
a what?
he's a dragon slayer!
Oh, he's a dragon slayer.
Oh, good.
and I suppose that makes you King Arthur, does it?
christ Almighty, Quinn.
I mean, even if you believe that, and you'd have to be an imbecile,
do you not think we'd be easy meat for these guys?
you weren't there.
look at this guy. Look. Look.
I mean, he looks like... like a... like a rogue Marine.
you remember those guys? Oh, yeah, sure.
they blew up plenty of dragons in their time,...
but they also took half the world...
you weren't there! I saw his eyes, Creedy!
man: Move it! Move it! Move it!
great job.
we ran a 30-mile grid in every direction nothing.
could be on the moon, Denton.
Quinn, this is Alexandra Jensen, U. S. Cavalry.
Oh. Captain Creedy.
how you doin'? Creedy.
Denton Van Zan.
how are you?
excuse me.
who are they?
archangels.
huh?
17 seconds once they jump from the chopper, that's their life expectancy.
you never thought of giving them parachutes?
they're not much help. They're bulla men.
what?
they were used by gladiators to snare other men.
not men, dragons.
so, you guys,...
jump out the chopper and use a net to snare dragons?
ha. I mean, sure, yeah.
I mean..., you would, wouldn't you?
three watches, eight hours each.
all the kids in the shelter.
rifles on the keep and walls.
excuse me.
aren't you forgetting who let them in?
don't mean I trust 'em.
all right, guys.
I just brewed a fresh pot, if that's what you're looking for.
a whetstone, actually.
sure.
is that your son?
no. Got him from the pound.
hmm. Is that where you get all your children?
I found him in a village near Bray.
3 years old, sitting with his mum.
he kept trying to wake her up.
she had been dead for days.
we were making our way up here, a few of us - me, Creedy, and Barlow.
no idea how we were gonna survive.
anyway, I grabbed him.
what else was I gonna do?
leave him.
most men would have especially back in the early years.
everybody's just running for their lives.
Yeah. Well, I didn't.
regretted it ever since, of course.
what are you doing here?
what do you want?
you want to know anything, you ask Van Zan.
get on the roof, go to south wall.
watch out the kids.
Goosh, you alive?!
not even close, Denton.
Alex! Radios are down!
cover the east ridge and tell me what you see!
men, get ready to rock 'n' roll!
we got a dragon to kill!
Goosh, set the triangulators! -Roger that!
Tito, Mead, Piscatella, bounce your butts!
move out!
Alex, what do you see?
no sign of it.
visibility is about 3 miles on the deck.
Roger that.
stay on the deck till I get the verticals up.
copy that, Van Zan.
waiting for triangulator. Safety first, guys.
Safety?! What part of this job do you find safe?!
it's not you I'm worried about. It's my chopper.
Oh. Cold. Ha ha ha ha!
first vertical's up.
vertical 1 up, Alex.
copy that.
second vertical is up.
second vertical is up, Alex.
now, once I have radar, you go to 5, 000 feet.
fly directly back above my location.
Gideon, you and the boys bring that bitch right down on my head,...
...and I'll take it from there.
copy that, Van Zan.
Alvarez, you're the bait.
Jefferson, you and I are the gunners.
we don't open our chutes...
...until you give us confirmation that it's down, right?
bogey on our tail, 200 yards!
go, go, go, go! -Roger!
I'll try to lose it up in the clouds.
Piscatella, do you read me?
van Zan: God damn it, Piscatella! Get your vertical up!
come on, number 3! Piscatella, that's you!
Piscatella: I'm almost there!
I'm almost at the top of the...
God damn it, Piscatella. Come in.
ajay?
can you hear anything?
van Zan's trying to take it on, Quinn, using some kind of 3-d mapping device.
if they don't get that third vertical up,
Alex is flying blind.
come on!
van Zan, what's going on?
I'm at altitude. We're blind up here.
can you give me some time?
I'm having trouble with the third vertical.
van Zan: Come on, number 3! Piscatella, that's you!
get your vertical up!
all right, Piscatella.
third vertical's up.
Alex, we have visual.
monitor's coming up.
shit!
hold on!
Alvarez!
it's right on him! It's right on him!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
damn it!
talk to me, Alex!
angels are flying.
Alex, do you have a reading?!
okay. Target - 1, 500 feet.
copy that.
Alvarez, do you have a visual?!
negative.
damn it! It's right on top of me! Shoot!
shoot at what?! I can't see a thing!
nets away!
great shot!
all right, Jefferson! Fly out!
Roger that.
Alvarez, can you see it?
negative. I think it's down.
copy that.
shit! Alex, both nets just flew right by me.
Alvarez, can you confirm that it is down?
copy that!
negative! It's on me!
Jefferson, I'm not getting any contact with Alvarez.
keep your eyes open.
Roger that.
Jefferson, look out! -Oh, my God...
Alex: Gideon's down.
Piscatella.
Piscatella, do you read me?
van Zan.
who is this?
Quinn.
Quinn, where's Piscatella?
he's gone.
are you ready to ride?
cause you got about 30 seconds till the bitch is on top of you.
you bring her to me.
you're the bait, Quinn, 1, 600 pounds of horseflesh.
ride her right down my throat. Do you read me?
ride the north road to the quarry.
bring her to me, Quinn.
I'm coming.
hmm? Here we go.
okay. Okay.
come on!
line up 20 yards south by southwest!
1, 200 yards.
wind velocity... 10. 2 north by northwest.
Yeah, this is really good stuff. Thanks.
Hey, good day, Quinn, yeah? ‚ô™Got a new fool‚ô™
all right, Quinn. ‚ô™I'd like to laugh at‚ô™
hats off to you, mate.
envy the country that has heroes, huh?!
I say pity the country that needs 'em.
what are you celebrating?
one dragon down, three men dead? Oh, yeah.
at that rate, we might just be getting somewhere in about 320 years.
is that what you want?
you want a little accommodation?
these beasts live on ash.
they feed on death.
there's no middle ground not for them, not for us.
and sure as hell not for my men who died out there today.
but you go ahead.
have your little soiree.
personally, you disgust me.
we bury our dead at dawn.
what are you doing here, Quinn?
you're standing on ground where I've buried hundreds.
this is my home.
I'm asking the questions.
what are you doing here?
I lead, you follow.
I kept these for you.
they sent them off proud, Alex.
Alex is the keeper of the dead, Quinn.
she's our memory.
when this thing is over, she's gonna build a wall with those things.
and, unfortunately, it's gonna be a very long wall.
I'm out of resources, Quinn.
I'm out of men.
Alex, tell him.
did you see the one we brought down, the big bull?
Yeah.
well, it wasn't. It was a female.
there was at least one egg, probably more.
we've hit over 200 of them, and as far as we can tell, they're all females.
how about you, Quinn? You ever seen a male?
I don't know.
when I'm running for my life, I don't stop to look at the plumbing.
well, we have.
Alex discovered it about two years back.
she worked out how the fire in the glands...
two glands in the mouth secrete separate chemicals, yep.
that's right.
combine in exhalation - Nitro-Napalm.
Yeah. Well, the chemical engineer is dead now.
that was his theory.
we figure they're like fish.
the females spawn the eggs.
one male passes over and fertilizes thousands.
did you hear what she said, Quinn?
one male.
that's why we never see any others, cause there's only one.
now, we tracked the epidemiology of these things, and we found out where they're from.
and that is why we're here.
we kill the male, we kill the species.
we're going to London.
good luck. It's that way.
no, I need soldiers.
Quinn, are you listening to me? I need men...
men from Pembury went to London.
and maybe she's right, because they disturbed something.
90 of them died, and then it backtracked them to their fortress.
and you haven't seen destruction like that, Van Zan not even in this world.
so we walk over dead men...
not with my people, you won't!
I've got a castle full of them.
I'm trying to keep them alive.
you're just letting them die slower.
I said no.
I made a mistake letting you through those gates.
I saw something in your eyes. I thought it was awe. I was wrong.
it's madness. You're insane.
and I want you out before you do more damage.
look out the window.
eden's not burning. It's burnt.
why don't you want to go?
what happened there?
my mother was working on a railway tunnel - project engineer.
she died there, okay?
you've seen it, haven't you?
Quinn!
trouble.
there's nothing magical about 'em.
they're made up of a collection of organs.
they have a mind, a heart, and a liver.
you take out one of these, you bring down the beast!
is that it? Four of you?
Eddie.
Eddie, what you doin'?
you got kids, man.
that's why I'm going, Creedy. That's why.
the volunteer section of this campaign's now over. It's time for the draft.
Tito, Mead...
get the six strongest men they have and load 'em up.
right. -Got it.
dig your own holes. Die in 'em.
Oi!
I said no!
no, Quinn!
get out of my way, Quinn.
okay, okay.
get him off!
I'll kill ya!... -Stop! Van Zan! Stop it!
I'll kill ya!...
that's what we need. -I'll kill ya!
he's gonna bring it back here!
man: All right.
all right, he's had enough.
go, London!
come on! Move 'em out!
come on! Grab those guys!
you, you, you!
he would have killed you.
he doesn't feel things.
that's the only way he can do what he does.
here. Take this.
iodine.
hurts like hell, but it kills anything.
good luck, Quinn.
you too busy to say goodbye?
you're not my father.
you can't stop me, Quinn.
I can be an archangel.
Gideon says he'll teach me.
17 seconds.
did he tell you that's how long they live?
not the good ones. Gideon's an 8-year veteran.
at least they're still killing them.
a couple of years, Jerry.
that's all I'm asking for. Give me that.
after that, you'll be old enough, and you can lead 'em.
that's what I want. Out of everyone, you're the best.
it's a waste of time, Quinn - all of it.
you're right. I'm not your father.
I can't lock you in. I can't make you stay.
and if you think you're man enough to speak like that, then I guess you're man enough to go.
goodbye, Jared.
you look after yourself.
that dragon smells like shit.
are you gonna burn it?
I love it.
they hate the smell of their dead.
it's the only thing that scares 'em.
it might buy us a couple of days.
sorry, Quinn.
so am I.
this time I was thinking I got rid of you for sure.
Alex: Van Zan, what are we doing?
do you see a way through?
negative. It's blocked for miles.
as far as the river, Denton.
head back, Alex.
find me a way around.
copy.
is this Pembury?
this looks like Pembury.
do you want to turn back?
nukes must have done this.
nukes didn't do this.
should we set the triangulators?
no time.
man the 50-cal, lock and load, cut the engines, and take your positions.
you heard him! Lock and load!
let's move! Let's move!
I think it's playing with us.
it's not playing with us.
it's setting us up.
easy. Easy.
easy, girl.
van Zan, it's Alex. Can you read me?
van Zan, can you hear me?
van Zan, if you can hear me, I'm coming back.
can anybody hear me?
van Zan!
van Zan!
van Zan!
Denton what happened?
it was him.
where are the soldiers?
one pass.
he flew over just once.
the castle.
get the hell out of there!
take cover, everybody!
get it moving!
anybody upstairs?!
Jerry!
Creedy! -Quinn!
have you got them all?
boy: Creedy, help!
I'll get him! You take her downstairs!
hurry up! Quinn!
that thing won't stop until it's killed us all!
Katie... she won't move.
come on, Katie.
Willam, well done. Get on my shoulder.
Katie, come on. Let go of the wall.
let go. Let go!
take her! Take her!
everybody, move to the back!
I've got all the kids. Okay, keep pushing up.
Katie's blanket.
where is everyone?!
don't you go up there, Quinn!
there's 65 people up there, Creedy. I'm going!
God damn it, Quinn.
don't you dare leave! It's too dangerous!
I'll clean it up.
Creedy!
Noooo!
Creedy! Ahh!
No!
No!
Creedy!... -Creedy!...
what do we do when we wake?
all: Keep both eyes on the sky.
what do we do...
what do we...
what do we do when we sleep?
all: Keep one eye on the sky.
women: What do we do when we see him?
all: Dig hard, dig deep, run for shelter, and never look back.
Jerry
we're alive!
we're in here!
push!
back away!
you were right.
I salvaged what I could from your armory.
we got one rifle, two automatics, two crossbows, and explosive heads.
you, me, and Alex...
down the coast in the chopper.
stay tight to the cliffs.
the Thames will take us right into the heart of London.
I know where he lives.
magic hour...
...you say that's when they're the weakest.
we'll see.
you're going home.
Jerry
Yeah, Quinn?
you keep them safe.
well, this town's gone to hell.
they must have heard us coming.
what's stopping them?
it's not us.
either way, we gotta get in there.
come on, guys. We're outnumbered hundreds to 3.
they know this city from the sky down, and I know it from the bottom up.
if we can get in quiet, I can sneak us into some tunnels.
that should get us close.
good Christ.
did he see us?
they must be starving.
they're eating their own.
Oh, we're dead.
look on the bright side.
now we've got him outnumbered 3 to 1.
now you ready?
Yeah.
Quinn
you lead. We follow.
there's an underground passage...
...leads to the construction site!
down here!
clear.
four tunnels meet at this shaft.
leads up to a square. There used to be buildings up there.
if they're still around, could be good coverage.
Yeah, if it goes to the street, that's what we take.
Alex, give me the sticks.
Quinn, these are highly volatile heads.
you fire them with your crossbow.
now, when you...
he knows we're here. Shh.
okay.
how tall is that shaft?
150 feet.
all right. Here's the plan...
when we get to street level, we gotta bring that bull's ass to the ground, and I'm gonna take care of that.
now, one shot's gonna kill him, and it's gonna be with this.
he only exposes his chest before he breathes fire.
now, these are magnesium-tip C-4 arrows, and they only fly about 50 feet.
so, when you fire, you gotta be standing in the furnace.
so do not hesitate. If you do, we die.
Ah, he's playing hide-and-seek.
more like cat and mouse.
Quinn!
use it!
Oh, he's eating it up.
I can't see a damn thing, Quinn.
what am I looking at?
this is an enclosed square. It's about 100 meters across.
there's a building right in the middle.
that chimney looks down over the lot of it.
what do you think?
I don't know yet.
hey you scared?
no.
it was your idea to come to London.
Yeah, I thought I'd be at 3, 500 feet.
Yeah, I thought I'd have over 200 men with me right now.
life's got a funny way of turning out different, though, don't it?
Yeah.
Yeah. -Yeah.
see that railcar?
it'll give us a better view.
move.
drop your packs - weapons only.
okay, we're gonna have a window...
10, maybe 12 seconds every time he makes a turn, and we're gonna use it.
how?
we're gonna split up.
we stay together, take a hit, and we're gone, so we gotta use every angle.
now, Quinn, you're gonna take that west wall.
don't lock and load till you get there. You got it?
okay. What about you?
I got the north.
Alex, I need you to stay right here.
now, when Quinn and I make a move, it's gonna draw him off, and I don't think the son of a bitch can count.
now, he's gonna make another turn.
when he does, I'm gonna tell you to go.
you're gonna run like hell to that east wall. Don't think about it...
it's water!
Yeah. Keep it. You're gonna need it.
we have paid a terrible price.
and now we got a chance to make a difference.
we will.
now, that's our first window.
Quinn
move!
the arrows.
Alex!
in about 8 seconds, we're gonna have a window!
now, when I tell you to go, you run like hell straight to the base of this chimney!
are you ready?!
go! Go!
go!
run like the wind, baby!
come on, big boy!
that's right.
Quinn!
Alex!
stop!
I'm fine.
what are we gonna do?
I lost the explosives.
we're gonna find 'em.
run!
keep going!
go around the other side!
I'll slow him down!
he's not moving. He's waiting for us.
Quinn, by the truck - the arrow.
by the wheel.
No!
die!
he always thought you could do it.
and you did.
come on.
Quinn! Quinn! Quinn!
we got a signal! Quinn!
we got a signal.
well, what's the problem?
they're speaking French.
well, don't come to me. I'm lousy at French.
they want to speak to the person in charge.
well, that would be you, then.
just keep 'em talking.
get us a good bottle of wine or something.
go on, now.
Thanks, Quinn.
go on, all of you.
all right. Cheers. -Well done!
you think it'll last?
I don't know.
it's been, what, three months since we saw the last one?
if they come, they'll burn, we'll build.
or maybe I'll just kill 'em.
and here I thought optimism was against your nature.
it's a recent development.
well, here's to evolution.
since Mary, Queen of Scotland, was a child, the English have wanted her country and her crown.
she is sent to France to wed its next king, to save herself and her people, a bond that should protect her, but there are forces that conspire...
forces of darkness, forces of the heart.
long may she reign.
tell me your visions have changed.
my dreams are more ominous.
Mary's presence here will cost you your firstborn.
you know what my heart says now?
it says I should forget about politics and be with you.
you're a true queen.
a queen that any king would kill for.
you're a servant. Nothing can ever happen between us.
but it did.
that language that you spoke... - I told you, it's nothing.
it's just an old dialect. - It's pagan or Druid.
it's nonsense, but the vagrants in the woods believe it.
Vagrants? Is that what those were?
and Colin? They used him as a sacrifice.
now you know why the woods aren't safe.
stop! Stop! Stop!
what are you doing?
damn near got yourself killed!
the... the river's gone over with the rains.
the whole road's flooded up ahead.
that so? Is there another way to the castle?
sure. Just cut through the woods.
it's about an hour due north. Ain't likely to miss it.
stay out of the road, do you hear?
next time, you may not be so lucky.
I can't move! - No, no!
what is that?
are they gone?
I'm sorry. My leg, it's stuck. - I'm so sorry. We have to run.
I'll get help.
don't leave me.
no, please don't hurt me.
I'm glad you came to see me.
Yes, well, I thought we should discuss where we are with one another.
all right.
with the borders quiet in Scotland, my father and his advisors seem pleased that our alliance remained intact...
our... our engagement, as well.
and seeing as there's no political decisions... - Please just stop.
I was hoping we wouldn't talk anymore of politics.
since the borders are secure, as you said.
I was hoping we could be just... - Just a girl, as you called yourself once?
and just a boy.
well, a man, nearly.
go on... woman.
all right, then, I will.
if I were just me, Francis, not the future king of anything, and you were just you, Mary... Mary.
well... this would be the moment that I declared myself yours.
only yours.
and I'm yours.
truly.
and once I did that, I'd probably invite you to the Harvest Festival.
and I would probably say yes.
I would probably try to kiss you.
and I probably wouldn't let you.
at first.
and then you write your regrets on this ribbon, tie them to the stern and watch as they sail away.
what a lovely tradition. - Mary?
if I didn't know any better, I'd say you were actually enjoying your time in court, enjoying the harvest festival.
as a matter of fact, I am. Hello, Bash.
so what's brought about this change?
not that I'm complaining.
to see you smile is to feel the sun, Your Grace.
do you flirt with everyone?
absolutely everyone.
well, you'll find I'm not difficult to please.
just don't make an attempt on my life and you'll find I'm quite gay.
mm, is that all it takes?
that, and your brother.
well, I hope to get sauced at your wedding.
you need to take care with Bash.
he has feelings for you.
nonsense. You heard him, he flirts with everyone.
Mary. I didn't grow up in a convent.
bash lives here by favor of the king. If he falls out of favor, for any reason...
now I'm sure of it.
Greer, Lord Castleroy has been staring at you all morning.
well, don't look!
Oh, he would be a great catch.
his father's a Hapsburg, 14 removed from the crown.
rumor has it he's made a fortune in the spice trade.
well, what are you waiting for? One foot after the other.
but the peppercorn comes from the Piper nigrum vine.
I've seen it myself in India. - You've been to India?
how fascinating. Is it true the rivers are filled with crocodiles?
Oh, they're not as plentiful as pepper.
a miraculous spice. Keep it cool and dry, it doesn't deteriorate.
used to be you could pay your rent in pepper...
Oh, no. - Oh, no, no, it's all right.- Forgive me. Your lovely dress. I... I'm so sorry.
it's not your fault. Truly. - Excuse me.
lady Greer!
I... wanted to apologize.
I think I might have made you a little jumpy, caused the mishap with your dress.
you most certainly did cause it. You were staring at me. In public.
and I'm not a lady.
well, I know that. - Stop it.
what happened between us will not happen again, do you understand?
Absolutely.
would you like me to get the stain out?
there's an old kitchen trick.
but we must act quickly.
just... wait there.
don't come in my room. Not even close.
why are you always around? Catching my eye? I... it's maddening.
more.
more. A lit... a little more.
perfect.
I see you've bought a boat.
no, I've made a boat. For you.
and I've christened it, too.
the Just Mary.
pardon me, but we found a woman running at the perimeter of the woods, My Lord.
she's had quite a fright.
her carriage was overrun by bandits and she's asking for you.
excuse me.
we were attacked.
they killed my servant. Right in front of me, dead. - Shh, shh. It's all right.
that poor girl. Who is she?
she's Olivia d'Amencourt. Her family lived at court, for a time.
mathematics? I see.
and when did their mutual education end?
Oh, she left a few months before you arrived.
Brokenhearted?
bash, it's all right. Tell me.
we need to get you to the castle. Clear a path!
Yes. He was.
I hear you're feeling better.
Yes. Much. Thank you.
are you up to talking about what happened?
why did your driver cut through the woods?
the Kingsroad was flooded.
a young man told us.
Francis, the bandits... they came out of nowhere.
and they spoke in this strange tongue.
do you remember any of it?
Lumenick... dush... something guttural and foreign, I couldn't identify it.
I think I can.
Olivia... - You're wondering why I'm here.
when you left to marry another, you gave me the distinct impression that you would not return.
I know.
but things have changed since then.
it was discovered... that you and I were intimate.
how? - I don't know.
perhaps a servant whispered to another. But the source hardly matters.
once it got in the air, I was ruined.
I'm so ashamed to come here this way...
but I had nowhere else to go.
please don't blame Bash for telling me about Olivia. I pressed him unmercifully.
so, why did she leave?
an offer of marriage.
not to mention the fact that my mother made her life absolutely miserable.
honing her skills on your first love.
what didn't she like about her?
there was an incident.
an incident where we were... found in the boathouse.
I see.
and, um, Olivia is married now? - No.
no, the offer fell through once people learned of our... relationship.
Mary, I'm... I'm sorry that my... my past has come back.
but know that it is in the past.
what I feel for Olivia now is a sense of responsibility.
she would've known what she was entering into.
we've been engaged since you were a child. Obviously you couldn't offer marriage.
which is... n... not to say that I don't understand why you want to help her. Of... of course, I do.
thank you.
it might take some time, but with my support, Olivia will regain her credibility.
and find a match.
one that ensures her happiness and her well-being.
so we can all move on.
it's a talent really. No matter what the topic, he can wind it back to pepper.
sorry, sorry, go on.
et vacet annalis. - I bring up politics.
pepper transactions are a political minefield.
History?"The peppercorn has a storied past.
I doubt he'd wind Virgil back to pepper.
Oh, stop. We know what happens. He wanders around Troy for another 100 stanzas.
shh, it's Olivia. She looks mortified.
you and I find ourselves strangely aligned for once.
are people leaving? She dislikes Olivia more than you?
apparently. - Why would Olivia return here?
with the prince's favor, she can find a match.
if need be, Francis could force the issue.
who would willingly take used property? Even a royal's.
well, it sounds like there were real feelings there.
should she be punished forever?
her station's fallen. She doesn't belong at court.
well, some might say the same of you.
because I don't have a title. How dare you.
stop, please. There's enough ill will at court today.
Hello, Olivia. I'm Mary.
I'm honored. - Oh, it's all right.
come, sit with me and my friends.
I'm afraid there's not going to be much Virgil.
everybody's too excited about the Harvest Festival.
and the beginning of the Blood Month.
they've been slaughtering in the kitchens all week.
out with the old, in with the new.
I heard that your things were still missing.
perhaps I could lend you a dress for the festival if you'd like.
thank you. I appreciate it.
well, hello there!
what exactly did you tell Mary about Olivia?
just that she was your first. I never said of how many.
don't be an ass. And keep your opinions to yourself.
well, forgive me if I overstepped.
is that all? - No.
no, I have reason to believe that Olivia's carriage was attacked by pagans.
I recognized the words she heard from when you said them.
well, what were they even doing driving through the Blood Wood?
Olivia's driver was told that the Kingsroad was flooded. Which it isn't.
bash, they're luring people in.
Oh, no.
this is Mary's ring. It has her crest on it. Why do you have it?
I was taking it to her. - Yet her room is that way.
then I remembered she lent it to me.
so I was taking it back. - Where?
you're confusing me.- Let's return it together.- No.
wait. I took it.
Why?
I don't know. I take things sometimes. It makes me feel better.
well, you're a troubled, jealous little girl. Aren't you?
please, Your Majesty. If Mary knew, I'd be sent home disgraced.
perhaps with one hand.
though your softhearted friend would probably spare you that.
I'll think on this.
looks like a trap. - What the hell?
your first is it? It's the heretics making sacrifice.
he's still breathing.
we should get out of here. They're still bleeding them out. Surely the devils are nearby.
he's breathing. Now get over here and catch him.
you're interrupting the ritual.
he's all but dead, don't do this. They might see you and come after you.
let them.
blues, I think. To compliment your complexion.
I'm sorry, your warmth. It's... unexpected.
I always knew Francis had a past.
men are allowed to have them, whereas we have our reputations ruined.
hardly seems fair.
I don't need your pity.
stop. I can see it all over your face.
you look at me and you see a girl who threw away her virginity on a man she knew she could never have.
well, you're wrong.
I thought I could have him.
because Francis spoke of marrying me.
that's not possible.
is your wedding assured?
was it always?
it might not be assured. But it is desired. By both of us.
though arguably, you know much less about Francie's desires than I do.
what we had was true.
passion. Love. Intimacy.
it was not manufactured out of a perceived political need.
you've been gone a very long time.
things have changed.
perhaps.
or perhaps now that I'm here, offering myself as an option, he'll choose to be with me. Once again.
could you hear them? Were they close?
I had no sense of them.
some would say you had no sense.
that you defiled their faith.
a faith riddled with human sacrifice.
when did that start?
they've made blood sacrifices for centuries.
animal sacrifices. - Not always.
it was simply more hidden. Less bold.
I thought these murders, these bodies hanging, their true purpose was to scare people away.
civilized people from land that they believe is theirs. Or claimed for hunting.
and instead they're hunting civilized people. Travelers. Luring them in.
Why? What's changed? - I don't know.
but I do know this.
you have interrupted a sacrifice, which they will not take kindly to.
stay close to the castle in the coming days.
you could be in grave danger.
excuse me. I'm looking for the wine cellar. Can you direct me?
sure can, ma'am. It's just through there. Ain't likely to miss it.
have we met?
don't think so.
it's just... your voice, it sounds so familiar.
anyway. Thank you for your help.
Hey. Who... who's the lady?
Oh, that's a guest of the court. It's the girl who escaped from the road bandits.
didn't you hear? A carriage was overrun.
I... I did hear. Just didn't know anyone escaped.
we did discuss marriage once. A moment of weakness.
lovers, dreaming of a future together.
I was... caught up.
and not sure that the Scottish alliance was a good one.
caught up with a noble girl. And a very rich one.
not one with a country in need, hanging around her neck.
it's ironic, isn't it?
that the very alliance that forged our engagement has always complicated it terribly.
it has. But that is beyond our control.
and the fact of the matter is, I am committed to you now.
I am glad to hear you say it.
and towards that end, the Viscountess Demarchelier has offered to house Olivia in Paris.
she has a very lavish estate.
in Paris? - I thought it best she go.
Olivia still has feelings for you.
she only confided in me to stake a claim.
I... I know that you feel responsible for her...
but I wanted to help you find a comfortable arrangement.
I'll let Olivia know.
Mary strikes me as a most dutiful daughter.
she writes so often to her mother, doesn't she?
they've been separated a long while.
well, yes, they have.
have you made a decision about my wrongdoing?
not yet, dear. I met Marie de Guise only once.
after the engagement to Francis was negotiated, she delivered her six-year-old daughter to me.
personally, I found her quite cold.
and poor Mary, she was so scared.
I had to take her under my wing.
we were quite close when she was young, did you know that?
I didn't. - You know, it's true.
and then her life was threatened, and I had to send her away to the convent.
and that was very difficult. I'd grown quite attached.
you could say I associate her with loss, and it pains me.
that's why I push her away.
upon reflection, I have made a few missteps since her return.
I'm afraid she's not honest with me when I ask her if she's happy here in France.
I assume she's more honest with her mother.
here's an idea.
before Mary's letters to her mother are posted, why don't you bring them to me?
and that way, I can improve upon her stay at court.
your Grace... - Those are my terms.
reject them, and you'll be sent home disgraced, labeled a thief, and your future destroyed.
well, do think it over. The decision's yours.
lady Olivia d'Amencourt requests an audience, My Lord.
Olivia. I was coming to find you, actually.
I couldn't resist.
we've been old enough to drink for a while now.
Yes, I know, but smuggling it in was always half the fun.
have a drink with me.
all right. Just one.
Ah, but that's what you said last year. Do you remember?
I remember nothing of last year.
you were spongy with liquor.
I had to keep you hidden from your mother all day.
God, how she hated me.
I should tell you my news while I have the chance.
I've arranged for a very well-regarded family in Paris to host you for as long as you need.
what?
surely your problems of reputation have not reached as far as Paris.
it's far away from here, far from your home.
the Demarcheliers will make valuable introductions to society, and from there...
but you said I could stay here.
why are you changing your mind?
I think you know.
this is best... for all parties involved.
unfortunately, the stain removal was unsuccessful... to my great displeasure.
don't speak to me of your pleasure. You managed to get me out of my dress.
true. That was a success.
I'm laughable to you, is that it?
no, of course not.
I must be, for you to behave in this fashion.
you don't understand what's at stake.
I have two younger sisters who cannot marry until I do.
my family has spent a fortune, all to see me land the right man.
it's all they care about, it's all I've been raised to do.
and if I'm linked to you, that will never happen.
look, I do care because I care for you.
it doesn't have to stop your goals, your marriage, your mission here.
and if people find out?
there's a girl here whose reputation was ruined over the love for a royal.
imagine if that had been a kitchen boy.
I'm sorry, but the shame.
I understand.
I'll leave you be.
I don't see why I can't just stay here, for a time, anyway.
Mary's under the impression that you still care for me, which makes her uncomfortable, understandably.
she's right.
I made such a mistake leaving.
Olivia... we both knew that you would.
I've always been engaged. - Engagements break.
alliances end. - This one hasn't.
the only thing that's changed are my feelings for Mary.
the man I knew put his country first... above all else.
I so admired that about you.
your sense of duty.
that's the man I fell in love with.
it's the man I love still.
Olivia, you shouldn't say these things.
I have to.
Francis, this year has been torture.
and not because of the scandal, but because I had to endure it without you.
do you know how many nights I would lay in bed...
and remember how you used to touch me.
I want to stay.
if not as your wife... then as your mistress.
because I would rather have some small part of you, than none of you at all.
you want me... and I want you.
and I'm telling you... you can have me... any way you want.
Mary, what happened? Why is Olivia staying?
she's not.
but her belongings were recovered from the wood, and they're being unpacked in the east wing.
you must be mistaken. Maybe she's packing for Paris.
a servant told me. - Well, the servant must be wrong!
sorry. - I'll inquire again. Discreetly.
looks like your lady has a new necklace. So blatantly disrespectful.
I'm not sure what you mean.
I mean that Kenna wears a necklace...
given to me as a first anniversary gift from my husband the king; her lover.
you must be mistaken. - I'm not.
you didn't know?
well, it won't last.
you learn the signs after a while: which girl is serious, which is not.
sounds like a terrible way to live.
I've forgotten the alternative.
we were wed when we were 14, you know?
and we were happy, for a time.
I didn't realize.
that we loved each other or that love can turn?
especially the love of a king who's loved by so many.
kings are offered every opportunity.
no one dares see his indiscretions.
he'd known her first... Diane.
I found out she was there... in his heart... all along.
he's always very kind and noble to them afterwards.
he feels responsible for them.
it makes him feel even better about himself.
I don't know how it feels for them.
but we all go on.
and we're supposed to just sit there, discussing Virgil.
Virgil's a bore.
what a relief to hear someone else say it.
do you know which Roman I like?
Alaric the Visigoth. Ever heard of him?
he included 3, 000 pounds of pepper as part of the ransom he demanded from Rome when he sacked the city.
instead of payment, pepper!
true story.
my Lord. May I have a word?
excuse me.
the driver has died, unfortunately.
yet, in light of our previous conversation, I thought you might be interested in what he talked about before he passed over.
he spoke of the pagans need for the fresh blood sacrifice.
their god is more like the devil.
a devil on this earth.
he heard them talk of a creature. - A creature?
a bargain they've struck with a being who resides in the woods, in the dark. In a cave somewhere only a chosen few know of.
they give it blood, or it drains them of life.
I spoke with the servant, and Olivia is moving into the east wing.
so everyone lies to me.
Francis, you. - What?
Mary, have you not eaten? You seem a little unsteady.
where did you get the necklace?
is it true?
are you having an affair with the king?
it's not an affair; it's more.
he's in Paris breaking off with Diane. - And what of his wife?
their marriage is nothing more than a political alliance... she doesn't care.
so says the man who's trying to bed you.
since when do you care about the queen?
I don't. I care about you.
I know you feel protected, but you don't want Catherine de Medici as an enemy.
end it now, Kenna.
is that a command... given by my queen?
no. Given by a friend. But given nonetheless.
whatever you think this is, that it's love...
what I think is that he's asked me to be his official mistress.
which means I follow your commands no longer.
I answer to the king.
Mary, there you are.
have you moved Olivia into the castle? Tell me it isn't true.
I was coming to tell you.
I've had word that the home of the viscountess is no longer an option.
she's learned of Olivia's reputation.
but perhaps you could insist.
I don't want to make Olivia live with people that will resent having her.
but I resent having her. - I know.
and I'll find her somewhere else to stay. It just might take a little time.
has something happened between you two?
Francis, tell me or I'll imagine the worst.
I stopped it. - You stopped?
what did you start?
I want her gone. - I'm working on it.
now. I want her gone now. - You can't just say that.
you just told me something happened.
it won't happen again.- It's already happened again.- Mary, enough.
she's staying, and that's final.
that's it, then?
you can just decide? - Yes, I can, actually.
because this is my court, not yours.
and I'm the future king of France.
and I'm your future queen. - Then you'll learn to respect my decisions.
respect goes both ways.
I will not have a relationship like your mother and father.
I am nothing like my father, and for you to suggest otherwise...
then why are you acting like him? - I'm not.
if I was acting like my father, I would take Olivia as my mistress.
which is certainly an option.
then don't let me stop you.
I could use some of that.
everything all right?
no, it isn't.
I should probably tell you to slow down.
but you won't.
Lola. Have you seen Mary?
no, I haven't. Is everything all right?
I hope so.
I lost my temper, and I wish I hadn't.
she irritates me like no other.
there's hope in that. Go and find her.
it was so foolish of me to think that we could ever be just a boy and just a girl.
I mean, that implies that... that one is free to leave if one is unhappy.
and while I am stuck here with... with no recourse, he's free to do whatever he wants with whoever he wants.
do you think I'm overreacting? Am I boring you?
no. No, it's... unfathomable.
what is? - Francis has you.
why would he ever look elsewhere?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.
you're right. I should have.
we... shouldn't have done that.
I was angry and... and you...
they must be launching the ships.
um, I should go.
I'm sorry. That was a mistake.
my regrets are not hard to summon.
I'm sorry we fought.
I'm sorry I didn't eat more and drink less.
I'm sorry I overreacted.
perhaps after this we can talk? - No need.
you've expressed your feelings quite clearly.
your Majesty. - Your Majesty.
you did well, delivering Mary's letters to me.
let's make it a permanent arrangement.
Oh, look. Oh, they're launching their boats.
regrets are everywhere. How apt.
are you all right, Mary?
no. Regret is a terrible feeling.
and though I've sent my ship off, I am still filled with it.
what now? Look, I've done what you've asked. I've kept my distance.
I'll be married someday. Titled.
and I don't want to regret what I could have done with my time here. My youth.
no one can know about us.
Oh, the attack on your carriage, unfortunate though it was, certainly lent your arrival some drama.
I had no idea, dear.
come... where I can see you and be sure of your recovery.
tell me. How's it going?
it's horrible. I miss him... and he's right there. With Mary.
and I know I'm causing her so much pain.
I can make your family's life very difficult should you have second thoughts.
were you aggressive with Mary?
I followed your guidance and she reacted as you said she would.
she has a short temper. I like that about her.
Francis won't. He didn't.
though he still speaks of sending me off.
well, I'll take care of it, just as I took care of the Paris problem.
and once I break them up, then what?
I just go back home?
I try to forget him again?
my dear, you're not going home.
Oh, don't expect the worst.
you're going to be the next queen of France.
you want me to marry Francis?
but you don't even like me. - I like you more than a queen I can't control.
my dear, I wasn't titled when I married Henry.
I was just a rich girl, like you.
we are going to accomplish so much together.
so hurry along now and get pregnant.
I'm assuming you don't need my guidance in that arena.
I'm in.
the queen wants me to continue to give her your letters.
then I will keep writing them. Stay close.
I might have fallen for her sad story, the pitiful truth of her life.
she is never, ever on my side.
she's behind Olivia's return, I'm sure of it.
you've taken what doesn't belong to you.
who are you? - Adding to a debt you already owe.
the blood in the wood.
the blood. So you're aware.
you took from its source once before.
I found the body of a Scottish boy hanging in the wood.
I cut it down. - And you were allowed to go on your way.
you're one of them.
you're a monster, you know.
get down from there.
he wasn't yours to save, Sebastian.
how do you know my name?
we all do now. Go ahead. My life is worth nothing.
I've been seen. You owe a debt, and you will pay.
choose someone to sacrifice. - And if I refuse?
then we will choose for you.
do not be afraid. There is no fear.
it is a privilege to die in service of something so much greater.
since Mary, Queen of Scotland, was a child, the English have wanted her countryand her crown.
she is sent to France to wed its next king, to save herself and her people, a bond that should protect her.
but there are forces that conspire...
long may she reign.
if Mary weds my son, and it causes his death, as you predicted, this castle will see violencewithin its walls like none before.
what if you were legitimized?
you're talking about changing the line of succession, a nd that's the sort of talkthat gets bastards and mistresses beheaded.
whatever has been between us, believe me now, that I love my son.
I would go into hell for him. How far will you go?
it seems that we will go into hell together then.
why did you come back? You didn't know the gold was poisoned.
it was one man against ten. They would have killed you!
why would you do something so stupid? - Because I love you.
what?
because it's pretty obvious now that for us to stay sane, we need to be together.
it's morning. - I know.
if the servants are gossiping about your unmade bed, it is too late to rectify the situation.
do you think we're being too reckless?
I'm yours. You're mine.
I hope you're pregnant. - Francis!
it would force the wedding sooner. How could my father argue it?
you don't think what we're doing is wrong?
as we are not wed yet?
after we rulefor a great long while, and we leave France and Scotland to our children, and our grandchildren and our great grandchildren, and we meet our maker, you can ask him yourself.
forgive me, but there's word for you...
from the Holy See. - The Pope?
the cardinal from the Vatican is in the throne room.
or you could ask him now.
as the word of God is back at court.
you can be honest.
I'd gladly trade pain for respect.
aren't you in enough pain?
aren't I, seeing you like this? - You've barely been by my side.
you need to rest. - 'Cause you've been with her.
kenna, please. - I hear the rumors. I ask the servants.
Diane's been seen in your room.
she gives me counsel. She's my friend.
can we please forget about Diane? - Can you? Henry.
Henry, please look at me. Tell me the truth.
tell me that you love me.
I can't let her go.
I'm sorry. You wanted honesty.
I came back to the horrors of this attack.
a stranger with an old vendetta who came to destroy my line.
they came for your sons, but they attacked mebecause of my association to you.
because you made me your mistress.
I nearly died because of you, and you choose this moment to tell me that you want her?
I don't know if she's a habit, or a crutch, but I need her.
I've given you everything.
my virtue. I'm...I'm destroyed.
Oh, that's simply not true.
kenna, when we started this, you knew I had a wife and a mistress.
perhaps it was overreaching on both our partsto assume that I was capable of...exclusivity.
so, this is it? You're through with me?
that's not what I'm saying at all. We can continue.
but if you ask me again to choose between you and Diane, I'll choose Diane.
does the cardinal's visithave anything to do with you?
with your plans for me? - No.
I would know in advance, and the communications have taken placein the utmost secrecy.
legitimization takes time.
I don't want my brother's job.
even if the job gets you the woman you want?
your Majesty. Your Majesty.
she may care for Francis, but Mary will wed the next king of France.
that's no way to win a woman.
it worked for him. Why not you?
God bless us all.
there is news sent to us by Cardinal Tesson, the papal emissary.
in England, the Tudor queen is dying.
while she has not namedher successor... Many suspect, and believe, the rightful heir to the English throneis you, Mary Stuart.
the second England's queen dies, you will make your claim.
your marriage to my son will strengthen that claim, as it will show the worldthat you have the might of France at your side.
france fulfills its promise to Scotlandand to you.
it's time you and Francis are wed.
no, you can't do that.
we must celebrate. It's God's will.
do you hear me? It's God's will.
am I understanding this right?
that a new condition of the alliance, of our marriage, is that I deliver England to you?
my father wants it.
the Vatican's support makes him think he can get it.
Elizabeth has support, as well.
armies she's been gathering for years.
you realize what laying claim to England could cost me?
Yes, I do. It could cost you your head.
when the English Queen dies, so does Henry the VIII's line.
you are his next relation by blood.
Elizabeth is Henry the VIII's daughter. - By Anne Boleyn.
her parents' marriagewas never recognized by the Catholic Church.
She's...illegitimate. Her claim is weak, at best.
in God's eyes, she doesn't even exist.
how convenient God has this opinion, as Elizabeth happens to be Protestant.
the Pope doesn't want to lose a nation to Protestantism. Can you blame him?
a Scottish queen on the English throne?
a daughter born of one of Henry's wives, dismissed?
there will be uprisings. Wars. Catholics against Protestants, neighbor against neighbor.
england against Scotland.
and Elizabeth against Mary. Have you thought about that?
they say she's very cunning, and that she has many followers.
and she's always perceived Mary as a threat.
she will come after you, whether you've reached for the crown or not.
as for strife, civil wars, England will never be weaker.
what better time to strike?
if they push back, if there are wars, we will win.
you hate them.
england tore into my country for half a century.
they spilled French blood on French soil. Yes...I hate them.
you can make them ours.
together, you will some day rule half of Europe. England, Scotland and France.
don't let fear keep you from greatness. This is your destiny.
I want my son marriedto England's next queen, because I want England.
cost me England, and I will kill you. Are we clear?
I know. It's over. Did the Vatican tell you?
they don't need to. There's no way the Church can support a bastard's claimto the throne in Francewhen it's crushing a bastard's claim in England.
I'm sorry. - I'm not.
it was wrong of me to dangle her in front of you, - to play with your feelings. - Don't.
you can't want her...even in secret, even in your heart.
Francis will see your desire for her.
you told me yourself, he already has.
he forbade me from her.
and what effect did that have?
you and Francis...you talk as if Mary's a cool glass of water, and I'm a man dying of thirst.
and it's only our talk that makes you thirsty?
do you know why I warn you, why Francis has?
because there's a thirst inside her, as well, for you.
keep your distance from her.
no one is worth dying for.
you there, are these Diane's chambers?
Yes, my lady, but she's not in at the moment.
well, tell her that the king's mistresswould very much like a meeting.
my lady, I'm glad to have found you alone. - Do I know you?
I'm Father Ronissi, and you, as I just heard, are the king's mistress.
how do you do, Madame de Poitiers?
you're younger than I imagined.
I'm the priestwho has been answering your letters.
to the Vatican?
about your son, Sebastian. - Sebastian?
of course you would want him recognized, but...
you must realize, with the Pope's blessing of Mary and Francie's wedding, his desire to service the faithful of England...that your efforts must stop.
Mine...and the king's?
the king is completely unaware, as you'd requested.
I hope you understand. - I'm beginning to.
I mean... of course. Thank you.
are you breathing easier now?
I still don't want to go back to the castle.
they'll want answers.
my father didn't pose our marriage as a question, but I will.
do you want this?
I want you, but I'm afraid.
I don't want to start a war.
and what if my efforts fail? What if no one supports my claim in England?
every Catholic will.
I know you want time to sort this out, to assess what France and the Vatican can offer.
and maybe we have time before theEnglish queen dies, before you have to stake your claim.
but we are a separate issue. And this is our chance, right now, to be together, without anyone or anything standing in our way.
what are you saying?
marry me.
and we'll figure outwhat you should do with England later.
you mean trick your father, the King of France, into believing that I agree with him?
Yes. We should deceive him.
it's for a very good cause.
and you won't pressure me laterabout England?
I'll pressure you, and listen to you, and argue with you, and love youuntil the day I die.
together, we'll decide what is right, as husband and wife.
marry me. Say yes.
Yes. Yes!
I am sorry, Your... Your Majesty.
lady Kenna said you would be expecting her?
I need a moment alone.
it would be in both of our interests for you to hear me out.
Oh, God, you look terrible.
I feel for you, but if this is about Henry, you can't imagine -how little he interests me at the moment. - It's also about your son.
I can save him immeasurable pain.
go.
is this about the wedding?
the wedding? No, it's about Diane. - Oh. Get out.
why do you allow her to live here?
why do you agree to coexist?
she means nothing to me, not anymore.
why, when she took what's yours, what's now mine?
what does she have over him?
and why shouldn't we use information that I have over her?
go on. - I think Diane plans to have Bash legitimized.
behind your back, behind Henry's. It could cost France everything.
how do you know this?
I was on my way to her room to confront her.
to say what? - I don't know.
beg her to give me a chance, I suppose.
Oh, dear lord, you really are a child.
I was mistaken for her.
that's when I learned of her effortsto have him recognized by the Church.
what else could that mean?
her plans have come to naught. That's what the emissary told me.
he adores Bash, and obviously, he loves Diane.
but he won't like this news, not now.
now with England in play.
she's rattling the line of succession, just when France needs to look very secure.
and undermining existing rulers?
well, some might call that treason.
she could be executed for this.
would that take care of your Diane problem? - No, that's not what I want.
and yet, you could live with it.
go. I'll see what I can do with this information, and how it might benefit me.
very good.
we're so happy for you.
Lola, what about you? - I'm pleased. I... I just...I want you to be safe.
I want you to be sure. England's an enormous risk.
are you taking that riskfor us, your people, or for the man you love?
my duty is to Scotland, and soon, to France.
I will make the decision that my conscience dictates.
Francis knows that.
but the king's orders... - What the king doesn't know won't hurt him.
he'd defy his father for you?
for us, for his people.
he's a good man.
I'm going to marry him tomorrow night.
tomorrow? Wh...But what...what will you wear?
well... well, what about your mother? She won't be here.
well, I have all of you. You're my real family.
Mary, come. Let's try different things with your hair.
up or down? What do you think?
depends on the veil.
my son doesn't believe that the future can be seen.
he thinks it's his and Mary's to control.
I've tried to drive her away.
I've triedto destroy her reputation, his love for her.
I've terrorized her.
don't do this. She is an innocent.
no, she's his equal in every way.
he loves her, she loves him.
what more could I wantfor my son except his survival?
there is another way.
there is no other way, except to remove the very source of the problem.
Francis will know, no matter how you hide your treachery. He will never forgive you.
he can hate me for the rest of his life. God willing, it's a long life.
if Francis won't listen, tell her.
tell Mary the truth. Tell her everything.
what, so she can tell others? The court, the king?
so we can burn for your dark magic, as heretics?
and for what, Nostradamus? - The chance of changing her own fate.
of saving the man she loves.
and if I can't convince her?
then there isno saving her, is there?
from the content...of the bottlein your bag.
but if you kill Mary, we will burn anyway.
in the fires of Hell for all eternity.
what do you want?
you and I have been through a great deal together.
I've come to respect you.
do you think I'm a stupid woman? Easily fooled?
no. - And what about Nostradamus?
I know that he's told you about your future. Do you believe him?
I believe his words have weight, that he has certain insights.
what does any of this matter?
Nostradamus believesthat some day you will be the cause of Francie's death.
that your marriage seals this fate.
he's seen the future. If you wed my son, it is very dark.
this is madness.
everything you've done to drive me awayhas been based on...
on some glimpse of... of a future? A future that no one can know. - No one except him.
what Nostradamus sees comes to pass, I can assure you over the years.
brutal storms, newborns dying. Love and war, treachery.
this is mere superstition. - Henry would call it worse.
if you tell the king what I've done, and why I've done it, he'd have grounds for my beheading.
he'd have Nostradamus killed without a second thought.
I give you a very powerful weapon against me, because I trust you won't use it.
instead, you'll do what needs to be done. - And what is that?
walk away from this marriage, from Francis.
a man I love, an alliance that my country needs. - He will die if you marry him.
I know that I'm asking you to sacrifice, - but if you believe, at all... - I don't. I don't believe any of it.
be very sure of that.
think about anything Nostradamus has ever told you, anything he's ever predicted.
has it come to pass?
have you told Francis about this? - He won't believe me.
he deserves at the very leastto know what you believe.
is that really whyyou would share the prophecy with him?
or is it so he could talk you out of your fears? Because he will.
is it so he can choose his own fate?
because you know he'd risk his life for you. He loves you, and you love him, but that love must make you strong, not weak.
please don't let it kill him, I beg of you.
what did you see? Of Francis?
what would make you believe?
and you must believe a little, or you'd have run straight to Francis, or to the king.
you told me oncethat the lion would fight the dragon in a field of poppies.
there was truth in that. - Yes, I did.
but that's not your real question.
ask it. Can the future I see for you and Francis be changed?
Yes, it can.
by any other means than letting him go? - No.
all images of Francie's death are tied to your union.
you will be blamed for the death of the queen's firstborn.
you will blame yourself, most of all.
I see Francis, barely older than he is now, cold to your touch.
you are wed but childless. Alone at this court.
without a friend to comfort you. - Stop. You're cruel.
do you think I want to see these things?
do you think I want to tell a mother her son will die?
so much sacrifice, so much slaughter.
one among you, a girl, dead in a day's time. Do you think... - What do you mean one among us?
Kenna. Don't listen. This is meant to scare me, not you.
you said one among us. A girl.
Yes. A girl. I see your ladies, circled around.
I don't know who.
but one among you will die before the next frost melts.
you said that some fates could be changed.
not this one.
none of us will die. It's nonsense.
Nostradamus said I'd fall in love with a manwith a white mark on his face. That never happened.
have you fallen in love at all?
you disappear for hours. Where do you go?
he said I'd never go home again.
it haunts me still.
that was his intention.
Nostradamus likes to scare people. He's the queen's watchdog.
well, we can't trust her.
maybe this is her last attempt to keep you from Francis.
or she was trying to keep me from Francis to save his life.
I don't know if there's any truth to this prophecy, but...the queenand Nostradamus seem to believe what he's saying.
what do you believe?
you said you couldn't sleep for daysafter you saw Tomas' banner unfurl.
and it was a dragon, as Nostradamus predicted.
the lion and the dragon will fight on a field of poppies.
the lion being the Englishthat Tomas' soldiers sailed off to confront.
sailors. On the sea.
so where was his field of poppies?
you're right.
but Tomas fought his real battle, the one he fought himself, in the forest.
there were poppies everywhere at that time, all through the woods.
where Tomas was slain. By Francis. And Bash.
you know how Tomas died.
and, yes, there were poppies there. In full bloom.
that's an odd thing to remember.
the mind focuses on small thingswhen faced with the larger horror of taking a life.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up.
to tell the truth, I... I'm probably just lookingfor connections that aren't there.
to what end?
did Nostradamus tell you something you hope is true?
no. - I've known him many years.
he's right more than he's wrong.
and when he's wrong, I often wonder if we...
misinterpreted what he said, and he's too cautiousto argue otherwise.
Tomas' symbol was, in fact, the dragon.
self-important but self-chosen.
and the lion was the English, of course.
as I said, Tomas chose his own symbol.
that's what we bastard-born do, as technically we belong to no one.
allowing me...to choose the lion for myself.
is this the sword you fought Tomas with?
a fight to the death. In a field of poppies.
well done.
dear Diane.
Henry will be back shortlywith your glass of port, your apples and salted biscuits.
it's such a lovely routinethe way he insists on taking care of you himself.
what is it you want?
I didn't think I wanted anything from you.
I didn't think it was possible.
as you have become such a certainty.
and here's another: Henry strays from you to a young girland then gets bored and returns to you. I don't know how you do it.
because I love him for who he is, notwhat he can give me.
no, I meant I don't know how you can put up with it.
I put up with you, the public humiliation, because at least, in private,
I don't have him grinding on top of me.
perhaps I'm saving us both some discomfort.
get dressed. And go. I know about the legitimization.
don't bother trying to deny it.
I have ties with the Vatican who can confirm it, but...do you know how I learned?
Kenna. She was mistaken for you. In your younger years.
she was very badly beaten and she looked terrible.
you won't look so good yourselfif word of this leaks out.
you love your son, too.
you would do anything for him. - Yes. I would.
but this I'm doing for myself.
because I'm anxious of late.
you could say that my son's wedding has me unnerved.
because you can't control his future wife. A queen.
I've given her some counsel.
I am eager to see if she takes it.
look at us. We're talking like old friends.
we've known each other for a long time.
this acquaintance is about to be terminated.
disappear. Make up anyexcuse, but do not come back.
if you do, I'll tell Henry what you've done.
he'd understand. He adores Bash.
he might have understood if your timing had been better.
Henry's fondness for anyone is eclipsed by his love of power.
he wants England, and he's getting itwhen Francis marries Mary.
well...you could say, suddenly, Francis may be his favorite son.
and you may be executed for treason. - Bash never wanted this.
if Sebastian died because of your words,
Henry would never forgive you. He would find a way to kill you.
which is why I'm letting you leave his bed, our castle, with your life.
but, there is somethingI want to share with you first.
something you can share with Kenna.
you want me to poison her. Why?
there are two things I can't abide, betrayal and stupidity, and Kenna's guilty of both.
one can be tempered, the other can never be remedied.
Oh, she wants what she wants, and she will go and get it at any cost.
her desire for the king may yet cost you your life.
and there's one other person who stands in her way.
who is that? Wait, I know.
his wife. Me.
and when she crosses me... and she will...she will be dead anyway.
all I'm askingis that you take this one thing off of my plate.
why must I always be the one with blood on my hands?
Oh, it's sage. It's very nice.
these are my terms.
morning.
morning - Hello. Aylee, - would you pass me that, please?
it smells nice. What is it?
it's a brew of lemon and honey.
and a herb. - It smells floral, to me.
it's supposed to soothe and heal.
you can have it if you'd like. It's quite good.
uh, would you hold this? My family sent me these.
as gifts to be worn on the day Mary would be wed.
Oh... You're so modest. Sometimes I forget your family owns half of Scotland.
only the lower half.
they're yours to keep.
Aylee, thank you.
do you think the wedding will still happen though?
I know Mary talked to Bash.
Nostradamus' prediction about Tomas' death was true.
I think that's open to interpretation.
my head is pounding with the stress.
of whether there'll be a wedding or what you should wear?
the only magic I believe in is love.
she should marry him. To the power of love.
I want you to know...whatever happens, that I love you.
what's going to happen?
we're getting married tonight.
I know you're scared.
talk to me. If it's about England... - It's not politics.
it's us. We already have so much. To ask for more...
do you think we're testing fate?
testing fate how?
by believing we can have everything we ever wanted.
perhaps that privilege is reserved for gods, not queens and kings.
perhaps there is a terrible price to pay.
we've devoted our lives to our nations.
we're still taking an enormous risk for our countries, whether we lay a claim to England or...
defy my father and the Vatican, for what we think is rightfor our people.
I like that word,"we."And "our.
you've been alone in your struggles your entire life.
that's over now.
I would die for you.
guards!
your Majesty, come this way.
they found her like this.
they came to us, looking for you.
Aylee. - He said I'd never go home again.
Aylee, - no... Too much blood...shed for you.
you... we... we must... go home now.
Yes. To the power of love. And friendship.
but one among you will die.
you are sent from Hell. You are the Devil!
no. Oh, no. Please.
the queen knows of my plan to legitimize you.
Catherine has sworn to keep our secret, in trade, but she can't be trusted.
in trade for what?
nothing I can't live with.
she can't control me or you if she can't catch us.
I will find Henry again, outside the castle walls.
even if she tells him what I've done, I will make him understand.
when he travels, I will come to him.
I will win him over. I always do.
Mary will be wed to Francis, England will be in his gripand none of this will matter.
we will be back in his good graces, protected.
forgive me if I don't choose to run away with my motherand stay in the shadows while you seduce my fatherinto giving a damn about us.
then go on your own.
just swear you will leave today. You are my son.
go. Save yourself.
she was poisoned. Am I supposed to suspect the queen?
when I know the effects of this poison.
the blackening, the smell of violets.
this is new poison. Mine, not Catherine's.
have you been watching me?
do you know where I keep the key?
one never knows when you're close, do they?
why did you kill her?
Mary had to believe your prophecy. Or she would have wed Francis.
and the queen would have killed her.
you see Mary as a victim.
you think you have a bondbecause you see yourself as fate's victim, too.
but she is a beautiful queen, and you...
No! No! No! -... you are a monster.
No! No! - She is a victim!
this girl is your victim!
look. Look at what you've doneto a child of God! You, who are nothing!
you brought this on yourself. - No! No! No! No. No. No.
No...What about your duty to Scotland? What about the alliance?
I'll find a new one. This one has cost us too much already.
you have to tell Francis why. - I can't.
the queen is right. He'll just... talk me out of it.
but maybe there's some explanation... - For Nostradamus' gift?
I believe in it. For Aylee's death?
maybe. Whatever it is, she's still dead.
I can't risk it. I can't risk losing anyone else I love.
come with me. - We can't.
she stands a better chance of getting away on her own.
and you're right.
if Francis knows, he will stop you.
I'll send for you when I can.
we'll go home. To Scotland.
as Queen of Scotland, I have made a decision.
I lay no claim to the English throne.
there are too many lives at stake, and I have a duty to those who would die for me, who believe that I would die for them, regardless of my personal happiness.
I know your terms. I know this will cost me the man I love.
Mary, no... - You're risking everything.
everything you've spent your life waiting for. - I know.
you're walking away from England, from more power than you could ever imagine.
I'm walking away from France.
Mary...You're frightened. Now is the time for courage!
I don't understand.
please don't. I've made up my mind. - Without telling me?
I told you I was afraid.
I told you I wasn't sureif this was the right choice for my country.
what does that have to do with marrying me?
I told you, I have no terms. I only want you.
I can't trust that. - I don't believe you.
your loyalty is to France.
you have always told me so. - Have you not heard a word that I've said? I love you.
love is irrelevant to people like us, a privilege we do not share.
you told me that. I remember it all.
every word, every moment, for the rest of my life...I love you.
but I won't let other people die for me. - That is your fate.
as a ruler. - Not if I can help it.
you're not thinking clearly.
you're upset, about Aylee.
you can't make decisions now, but I can, and I'm never going to let you go.
all I ever wanted was you.
then we will work this out.
wait for me while I talk to my father before he goesscreaming to the Vatican and this...this gets out of hand.
wait for me. - I'll wait for you.
your Grace. May I be of service?
I was going riding. I'm fine.
I'll alert the guards. - Please, uh, don't.
but it's not safe for you alone.
if the king knew I let you go unattended... - You would be punished.
we're fine here.
I'll be glad to accompany the queen.
I have horses ready for us.
horses ready? But...you just offered...Of course.
where are you going? What's wrong?
I'm leaving.
I'm going away, and if you love your brother, you will not stand in my way.
away where? - Far.
that's my destination as well.
Mary! Stop!
Mary, please! Wait! Mary!
you're going to get what you deserve.
who are you, ghost? Come out.
so we can all see you!
NOSTRADAMUS: Her name is Clarissa.
how long has she been lurking in shadows listening to God knows what?
I will stake my claim on England...
and I will marry your son, but not Francis... Bash.
to the future king and queen of France,
scotland and England.
FRANCIS: I envied you for so long...
and look at us now.
you have what's mine and I have your freedom.
I plan to take full advantage of it.
you're holding me prisoner? - Guarded, day and night.
or at least until I'm back from Rome.
imprison her.
here we are...
the queen's private chambers.
it's all ours.
there you are.
you missed our ride this morning.
I'm sorry. I overslept.
I hope you weren't up all night worrying again.
just the fact that we've had no news from the Vatican.
and will you worrying make the Pope choose to legitimize me any sooner?
the Vatican will come around and when they do, you and I can finally be married.
I promise.
that's not all I'm worried about.
your half brothers, Charles and Henry...
I see their sad faces around the castle and I realize how hard this must be for them.
it's awful; I know.
there's a Frost Fair in the village this morning.
I want to take them, just us three.
as something special to take their minds off their troubles.
you are so good. So truly good.
will there be ice skating?
Yes, and sleigh rides and spice candy and puppet plays.
and all the boys and girls from the village will be there.
mother and Father don't like us playing with regular children.
: I wish Mother could be there.
I know.
will we see her...
before she dies?
don't worry about that now.
your mother wants you to be happy.
and she'll be happier knowing that you've had a lovely day.
guard: Coming through. Look out!
look out!
get back! All of you! - What's going on?
look! It's the Medici Princes!
death to Queen Catherine and her line!
your days are numbered, spawn of that Medici whore. - Get down.
who's there?
show yourself.
I won't take the blame if you've stolen from the queen.
Catherine: Where are my boys now?
bash is with them.
I warned you of the unrest that would result from changing the line of succession.
once the Vatican legitimizes Bash,
Henry will take off my head, those boys will be orphans.
they'll still have their father.
how much attention do you think they'll get from him as he cavorts with his new bride Diane?
and as for Bash, as soon as he takes power, he will face unrelenting pressure to do away with them.
I will not allow it.
I will take care of them.
you? - And Bash, as well.
we will raise them as if they were our own.
despite what you may think,
I never intended to harm your family.
I just wanted to save Francis.
I wish I could believe that.
and I want to help Clarissa, too.
Yes, she is your daughter.
we both know that.
and she saved my life.
how do you intend on coaxing her out of the passages?
I've ordered a mask made, to cover her deformity.
it's being delivered today.
and then when the time is right,
I will arrange for her to have chambers of her own.
you seriously intend to integrate her into society, after a life in the shadows, living like vermin?
that girl is broken, she is more animal than human.
the greatest mercy would be to have her put down.
you don't mean that.
you would never want that for your own child.
I suppose I'll have to get used to other people deciding what I want for my children.
they'll be out of my care, very shortly, when I'm dead.
which one's your marble?
it's that one.
henry: Where'd it go?
what can I do to protect my younger brothers?
there must be a way to make them safe.
I marvel that you could have been brought up at court and still understand it so poorly.
for a royal, there's no such thing as safety.
I realize the notion of my being king disappoints you, Lord Hugo.
it did once.
but not anymore.
Mary: You've switched sides?
I'm head of the king's Privy Council for two reasons:
I know how to manage men and I know how to pick the winning side.
in light of recent events, the queen's pending execution and Francis's continuing absence from court...
that side is yours.
how lucky I am to have such steadfast support.
if steadfast is what you require, there's only one way to achieve it.
factions need a flag to rally behind, and every young prince with a claim to the throne is another flag.
but, if those flags were taken away...
perhaps permanently...
are you suggesting...
killing the boys?!
I would never presume to make such a suggestion.
those boys are the king's own blood.
you asked about safety.
this morning's attack was mild.
we are aware of that and share your concern.
there are plots being set on both sides, no doubt...
and with deadlier consequences.
sooner or later, blood will be spilled.
it's just a matter of whose.
yours and Mary's...
or another's.
lord Hugo's right...
my brothers need to be dealt with.
dealt with"? What are you saying?
send them away from France.
I was sent to a nunnery at six.
it didn't stop the English from making attempts on my life.
you've had far more attempts against your life here.
you weren't there this morning.
those boys need our protection and I promised Catherine I would keep them safe.
we should keep them here with us.
and teach them to be constantly afraid?
always on the lookout for the next attack?
I won't have them grow up to fear their own shadows.
at least they'll have a chance of a normal childhood.
normal?
at court?
this is absurd.
you feel guilty for taking away what they had, so you want to keep them around, never mind what their lives might be like...
and you feel guilty because they remind you of Francis, so you want to get them out of sight.
is that really what you think?
it doesn't matter.
I forbid you from sending them away.
you forbid it?
how is this your decision?
I am the queen who's going to give your father the legacy of conquering England.
who do you think he's going to side with?
very well.
I'll go double the guard around the boys.
unless that means I don't love them enough.
are you all right?
have they mistreated you? - I'm fine...
as long as you brought the...
I brought the money.
thank God. Sorry you had to come all the way.
you wouldn't believe the string of bad luck I've had at the tables.
let's just get you out of here. To whom do you owe the money?
please excuse the trouble my brother has caused.
here's the sum he owes, plus interest.
how lucky you are to have such a lovely sister willing to go to such lengths to secure your release.
shall we?
unfortunately, this debt is more complicated.
what do you mean?
in addition to lying about his means, your brother attempted to cheat at my tables, a very serious breach of house rules.
perhaps an additional sum would help smooth things over.
such a grave crime requires more than money to repay it, don't you think?
what are you suggesting?
I admire the passion you have for your brother.
perhaps you would consider sharing some of that passion...
with me.
I need to see the prisoner.
and what is this that you're bringing?
a Bible.
so she can make peace with her maker before her execution.
if you're looking for a weapon, some say there's none greater than the Scriptures themselves.
Oh, good.
more sanctimonious talk from my self-appointed redeemer.
king Henry's actions may not have been fair, but it doesn't change the results.
you must seek absolution for your sins.
you think that is gonna save me?
if you really cared about my well-being, you'd have brought some poison like I asked!
then, at least, I could die with dignity, alone, at my own hand.
you mustn't say such things.
suicide is a mortal sin!
you'd be condemned to the fires of Hell.
Henry intends to make a spectacle of my death, as a final insult to me, and to bring some semblance of validity to his actions.
I won't grant him the satisfaction, if I have to tear my throat out with my own hands!
and unless you're prepared to help me in that goal, get out.
and don't return.
what's going on?
bash, what have you done?
charles: This is all for us?
Yes.
now go make friends.
you said they should have a normal childhood, but also be safe.
they missed out on the Frost Fair in the village, so...
Mary: You brought it to them.
that is the sweetest thing I've ever seen.
BASH: Their entire lives are filled with danger and isolation.
I just wanted them to have this day.
Mary, come help us with our masks!
I've made some arrangements.
I can pay you double the debt, but it'll take a week to assemble the money.
I don't think so.
well done.
what incredible luck you must have.
he's a cheat, just like your brother.
was that really necessary?
he's lucky I didn't crush both his hands.
that's the penalty at most establishments, but I prefer to be merciful.
your brother begged me to spare him that fate.
he said that your family was wealthy, and that he'd make it worth my while.
I had no idea how worthwhile until I laid my eyes on you.
why me?
you can't make this offer to many.
it's not good business.
you're a lady of title.
I've taken money from many a noble, but none ever treated me as an equal.
I'd like to know what it feels like to touch what only they can touch.
do we have a deal?
pardon me. I couldn't help
my benefactor, the Viscount de Brilhac, would like the chance to win her for himself.
she's not available. She's with me.
the Viscount is prepared to wager double her debt on one cut of the cards.
I've already been offered that.
FRANCIS: Four times, then.
surely the owner of the celebrated
Burgundy House is not afraid of a simple wager?
one cut of the cards.
four times the debt, plus the girl if I win.
and if I win, the debt is forgiven, and the girl is mine.
too bad, Monsieur Viscount.
double it again.
eight times the debt, you mean?
and the girl.
though I don't know why you'd risk it.
it's much safer to just take the money.
if your gallantry is as easy as your lovely inherited money, why not make it 16 times the debt?
no. - Very well.
after you.
Well-played.
luck of the draw.
shall we retire to my room, my lady?
wait.
you look familiar.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
I'm told I look like the Dauphin of France... only taller.
KENNA: Well, I agree with Mary.
look at them, having the time of their lives.
who's that?
I don't know. Some servant, perhaps?
he looks ill at ease, don't you think? - BOY: Ow!
: come here.
are you all right?
what is it?
we can't find the princes.
they're gone.
search the castle and the grounds, they can't have gone far.
and check the boys' chambers. And find Lord Hugo!
Mary, wait.
what are you doing?
you're wasting precious time!
the boys are fine.
how do you know?
because I arranged their disappearance.
What?!
from there, they'll continue to the Spanish border.
you had this plan in mind all along.
that's why you wanted your brothers outside.
you were planning their kidnapping!
they weren't safe here. Something had to be done.
lord HUGO: Sebastian. There you are.
we found this man hiding in the woods.
he had a rope and two burlap sacks.
I believe he intended to capture and drown the princes.
is this true?
you are the next great king, Sebastian.
the Medicis must die.
lord HUGO: We'll question him thoroughly, my lord.
if he knows anything about the princes' disappearance, we'll get it out of him.
out you get.
we'll go inside where no one can see us.
there. Right.
get some food in you.
we've got a long night ahead of us if we're going to make it to Troyes before daylight.
charles: I'm cold.
go on then. I'll fetch a blanket.
who's there?
clarissa, what are you doing here?
I was worried about you.
clarissa is my friend.
we played together at the castle.
how did you find us?
does anyone know you're here?
your mother will know soon enough.
I left her a message.
why are you wearing the driver's cloak and that mask?
Mary had it made for me.
do you like it?
I don't know.
are you going to stay with us?
I'm going to take care of you.
from now on, we're going to be a family.
pack up. Let's go.
thank you again, so much, for what you did.
to make such an enormous wager based on nothing but chance.
well, it's safer than fighting our way out.
my brother...
seems a little adrift.
I've traipsed all over Europe, pulling him out of this scrape or that, each time worse than the last.
but we're all my parents have left.
I can understand both sides, if you want the truth.
I am familiar with feeling adrift.
and with being let down by a brother I loved.
I'm sorry.
truly, I am.
I know they thought they were saving my life, or at least Mary did.
bash has his own reasons.
I envy you.
in what possible way?
well, you've escaped that hideous court.
you're not bound by duty or politics.
you don't have to lie or pretend.
you can do what you want.
you can set your own course.
well, it's not all it's cracked up to be, but there are things I don't miss.
like my mother's meddling, for one.
when I left, Henry had her locked in the tower, just until the annulment came through, but that didn't stop her from stirring up trouble.
she tried to get Mary and Bash...
what?
you don't want to hear it.
I do.
hearing it makes it real.
it still doesn't feel that way.
don't be ashamed of your pain.
it does you credit.
you have a true heart.
it will mend.
I'd like that very much.
shall we...
until we can sleep?
Yes, please.
what is it? - GUARD: I heard coughing, and now she won't answer.
did you check on her? - She's blocked the door with something.
I heard what she said before about taking her life.
open the door at once!
help me push it in! Quickly!
dear God.
untie the rope.
I must get her to the infirmary immediately.
what for? Would it not be a kindness to let her pass on?
the king wants her death to be a spectacle.
will you be the one to deny him that?
I'll be back with her as soon as I can.
tell no one.
and pray, for both our sakes, that I'm successful in reviving her.
NOSTRADAMUS: You're safe now.
Oh, thank God.
help me with this.
it's digging into my back like a butcher's hook.
you're lucky it held your weight or you'd have hung yourself for real.
you're lucky they didn't find it hidden in the spine of that Bible you brought.
lying isn't exactly your strong suit.
now, where am I meeting the wagon?
at the east end of the grounds.
past the stables.
it won't be comfortable, but...
what is it?
something you need to know.
missing?
do you mean kidnapped?
it's too early to say.
bash has sent guards to search for them. - Bash?
so the fox has offered to help find the missing chickens?
of course it's Bash or one of his backers.
who else would profit from my son's removal?
my sweet boys...
Oh, they'll be terrified if they're even...
you must go to your rendezvous.
the guards will be searching for you.
and abandon my children?
you can't help them from here.
you're a condemned woman.
go to Italy, gather your strength.
others will see to the safety of your children here.
others?
I'm their mother.
I will not leave this place until I know that my boys are safe or until I am actually dead.
what do you mean the boys didn't make it to the checkpoint?
they're probably fine.
the carriage could've lost a wheel or a horse come up lame.
I've ordered guards to ride out and look.
and what if they don't find them?
are you still so pleased with your choice to defy me and act so rashly?
there's no guarantee they'd have been any safer here.
a servant of Catherine's was just found dead in a passage behind her chambers.
along with this box.
the queen's enemies are growing bolder...
even in this castle which you deem so safe.
they're keepsakes.
mementos of her children.
so few people know of the passageways. Who would hide a body there?
I'm going to talk to the guards who found her.
I'll tell you if I learn anything.
please don't scream.
I mean you no harm.
how did you...? - I escaped, my dear.
I hid waiting. It's all very thrilling, but let's save that tale for later.
my sons are missing, and you promised to protect them.
bash has sent men after them, and he knows where to look, since he's the one who spirited them away for their safety.
for their safety"?
is that what he told you?
I know this might be hard for you to understand, but Bash cares for his brothers more than any crown.
besides, I think it might be another sibling who's interested.
you keep locks of your children's hair, but I don't believe you added this one to the collection.
is that skin?
I think it's Clarissa's.
she killed the servant that Bash was talking about.
who else uses the passages?
who else would rather kill than risk exposure in the light?
look at how it's knotted around your sons',
Charles and Little Henry's.
who else do you know who might feel like this, all knotted up inside over a family she just learned she had?
she threatened me once.
she said that I would get what I deserved, but what does that mean?
I think she wants you to know she has your sons.
to torment you in your final days before your execution.
you said Bash knows the direction they went in.
can he track them?
Francis always went on and on about his brother's hunting skills.
he can, and I'll be with him.
I'm coming with you.
I know.
I'll probably be caught, returned to my chains, but these are my children.
and if it's me that Clarissa wants to punish,
I need to be there to let her have her say.
I'm so sorry.
I... I must have nodded off.
me, too. We were talking very late.
and the wine.
Yes, and the wine.
I should go.
thank you for what you did yesterday for me and my brother.
it was brave and incredibly gallant.
and I'm so sorry to have imposed on you.
it was no imposition.
truly, it was nice to spend time with someone who I... didn't have to hide from.
I'm sorry; you don't want to hear this.
Yes, I do.
please, finish.
to anyone else, I'm a young man who has everything...
money, freedom, a world to explore at my leisure.
but when I think of all that,
I only feel...
emptiness.
pathetic, isn't it?
well, I hope not.
because I feel exactly the same.
we're a pathetic pair, aren't we?
we can't. Mary...
is no longer a part of my life.
like it or not, she's made her decision.
and I'll never see her again.
or me, after today.
I can't ask you to...
give up my virtue?
don't worry, I've known a man before.
just one, but...
Francis, I want to.
it's the driver I hired to take the boys to Troyes.
there's no blood other than his.
no reason to fear the worst just yet.
Yes, except my boys are still missing and perhaps in the hands of a monster.
I swear, if she harms a hair on their heads, I...
Mary: Charles and Clarissa have played together many times.
she's been friendly towards him.
BASH: We should split up to cover more ground.
even with several hours head start, a girl and two small boys couldn't have made it far.
we're going to find them.
you have my word. And believe me, if they're anything but the picture of health,
I'm the one you'll have to restrain.
bash, look...
it's little Henry's.
this way!
she's no mother.
she deserves this.
charles: Clarissa, what's happening?
why have we stopped?
we're going to play a game.
gather all the rocks you can and fill your pockets.
the heavier the better.
then what?
then we're going to go swimming.
but it's too cold.
and I don't know how to swim.
just do it!
what did we do?
are... are you angry with us?
stay back!
don't come any closer!
clarissa, please, you don't want to hurt Charles.
he's your friend.
he's my brother.
but I never knew.
cause she never told me. She didn't want me.
she hated me!
no. She didn't.
she just didn't know you.
she hated my face.
and they tried to fix it. That's why I look like this.
that's why I... I had to hide my whole life.
Mary: It was a misunderstanding.
a terrible misunderstanding.
but it can end now.
she took my family away.
now I'm going to do the same thing.
give me back little Henry or...
or I'll cut Charles!
clarissa, dear, listen to me.
I'm your mother. Stay back.
you're not my mother.
you told me you wished I was...
dead.
no, my dear.
I am your mother.
and do you know how I know?
I see you now.
holding that knife.
willing to pay any price for your convictions.
it's the same thing I've done.
more than once.
to fight for my children.
for what I knew was mine.
but look at your mother now...
condemned to die.
if you want the pain to stop, learn from your mother's mistakes.
choose a better way.
let yourself be loved.
: no.
no, no...
put down the knife, child.
we can all be together, all of us.
finally...
your true family.
mother!
you monster! Let him go!
you liar!
you don't care about me!
you never will.
you... you want us to be together?
we'll be together when we're all dead.
No!
come! Oh!
charles: Clarissa's dead?
Catherine: Yes.
and you were both so very brave.
and I'm so very proud of you.
you'll have to let go of them, Majesty.
it's time for you to get back to the castle and your cell.
don't worry, my darlings.
Mary will take good care of you.
they're both blue with cold.
do you hear me?
you were out of the tower before you knew about them, weren't you?
you were free and clear.
and yet you stayed for them.
I may never see them again.
once the Vatican sends word that Bash is legitimized, you two will be married.
and I'll be dead.
probably that very day.
I'm sorry.
I believe you mean that.
I owe all my sons' lives to you.
if you hadn't finished Clarissa...
you sent her to a better place.
this world never suited her.
and besides, she'll have her mother with her soon enough.
how are the boys?
fast asleep.
and Charles wasn't far behind.
especially when...
their mother is gone.
I know.
and extra security, too.
Oh, you mean... - Yes.
my brothers are staying.
you were right.
out there, we have to rely on others to look out for them.
but here, we can both keep an eye on them.
but I shouldn't have spoken to you the way I did.
giving you edicts, questioning your actions.
you did what had to.
without hesitation.
so you're not angry with me for acting impulsively?
safe choices don't always make us safe.
I see that now.
which is why I want you to marry me.
now. Today.
I don't understand.
we've been playing it safe.
and what has that gotten us?
factions and plots and uncertainty.
everything but safety.
and what do we get if we do get married now?
we get what we want.
we force their hand.
if the Pope wants a Catholic queen, one with the strength of France behind her claim to England, he'll have to legitimize you.
he'll have no choice.
the Pope always has a choice.
I'm willing to take that risk.
marry me.
no.
that's not how it's done.
this is how it's done.
marry me, Mary Queen of Scots.
and make me the luckiest bastard on Earth.
Yes.
well, I suppose this is good-bye then.
good luck on your travels.
and you, back at court.
don't remind me.
Maurice: Headed back to French court then?
I mean you no trouble.
just wanted to ask the lady a small favor.
throw that at her for me.
tell her to try to buy her way out of this one.
what are you talking about?
Oh, haven't you heard?
the king plans to behead her within the week.
and I, for one, will welcome the end of her Medici money rotting France.
Oh... bring that coin back with her blood on it,
did you know of this?
I had no idea.
it can't be true.
but if I don't...
I'll be letting him murder my mother.
it's freezing.
and it'll take us hours to dig her a grave.
so don't.
there's no one around to check us.
grab her feet.
that's more than this wretch deserves.
let's go.
it's not what we chose.
we're married before king and God.
you're pregnant with my husband's child.
and if Francis finds out...
I will do my very best to marry.
the beautiful creature standing beside me has agreed to be my wife!
have you changed your mind? - I'm pregnant.
you look very pretty.
perhaps it is time to rejoin society.
I can give you the pleasure you offer others.
these days he seems infatuated by Penelope.
barely even notices affairs of state.
you are ill... you could do harm to yourself, to France.
we have waited a long time for you to rise.
if it ever becomes a choice between our two countries,
I will choose mine.
what's this?
a wedding ring.
it's modest, I know.
it belonged to my grandmother.
I thought Diane de Poitiers came from money.
well, if you don't want it...
I didn't say that.
it's just... well, why?
we're married. We can't be un-married.
I thought we'd agreed to at least try.
how romantic.
Yes, let's... try.
well, there's a promising start.
they've spared no expense for Lola's wedding.
bares no resemblance to mine.
try not to be bitter on Lola's special day.
kenna, Greer, I found you!
look at this necklace Julien just gave me.
well, now I am bitter.
those sapphires are the size of grapes.
it's gorgeous.
but why are you talking to Julien before your wedding?
and why aren't you dressed?
the ceremony's in less than an hour.
wish me luck.
and happiness.
with all of our hearts.
I think they have a chance.
she seems so hopeful and excited.
you're next. Once Castleroy returns from his business.
we haven't set a date yet.
you might as well as it's inevitable.
your reputation can't do with a broken engagement.
thank you for the reminder.
at least Castleroy's title is real.
well, the Master of Horse and Hunt may not have any lands but...
at least Bash is young and handsome.
I suppose he is, isn't he?
how are things between you two?
I don't know.
I can sense that he's trying.
but the fact that he has to...
imagine how awful our wedding was, how monstrous... -- Lady Kenna?
your Grace.
I can see by your dress that you're still trying to...
impress your king.
it's working.
don't hide yourself away.
or I'll have to come find you.
this... itches.
how is this marriage ever going to work?
Oh, dear. Did I step on your toes?
are those tears of pain?
no.
I'm just so grateful.
you're too good to me.
do go on, wife.
this day, this necklace, marrying me, even in my situation.
no more of that talk.
I've only given you what you deserve.
from now on, we're in this together.
no secrets, no shame.
just the two of us on the adventure of our lives.
pleased to see you enjoying yourself.
it wasn't so long ago you were ready to rain anarchy down on this place.
it wasn't so long ago that your parents were trying to trick me into bequeathing them Scotland.
that's enough merriment for you two.
we have problems.
well, then.
mother, what's so wrong that it can't wait the length of a dance?
that impatient-looking man over there is Cardinal Morosini, the Pope's new envoy. and Don't look now.
I thought the cardinal wasn't due for another week.
the weather cleared in the Alps, and he left early.
he came all this way to see Henry.
but your father seems to have chosen not to attend.
well, maybe that's a blessing, seeing how Father is feeling.
can't the cardinal be told that the king's indisposed?
for an entire week?
that's how long the cardinal is staying.
he wants to renegotiate leases on the Pope's tenancies in France.
we depend on that income.
can't you negotiate with him?
let's just say that the cardinal wasn't my choice for his current position, and he's well aware of it.
there might be another way.
I have an idea.
I'm not sure about this.
trust me. Just follow my lead.
cardinal Morosini, what an honor and a pleasure to meet you.
your Grace, a pleasure indeed.
Dauphin.
you'll forgive our presumptions.
we thought you might agree, as Francis and I are the future of France and Scotland, and you are the future of Rome, that we might discuss the, how should I say it?
the intimacies of our Papal relations?
I'm not sure what you mean.
well, you're here to discuss rents and tenancies, yes?
with King Henry, indeed.
I'm sure Henry will sign off on anything that we agree on.
tell me, are cardinals permitted to dance?
to further the interests of Rome, why not?
then let us go further.
have you learned anything?
where is Henry?
queen Penelope told me to tell you that the king is quite tied up.
Oh, Good Lord.
where is Penelope?
she's gone to get supplies.
the waiting is horrible.
I love it.
Henry... that girl is humiliating us.
she's a thief.
she's looting the castle.
there are rumors that you have gifted her an entire estate.
she deserves it.
people are talking about your behavior.
her control over you.
rumors could reach the Vatican.
is the cardinal already here?
you've had your fun with the girl.
but it has to stop. Now.
I will not be so demeaned by a woman!
Yes, I can see that.
your Grace, I've come to announce the arrival of James Stewart, Earl of Moray.
my lord Earl of Moray.
why are you still on your knees?
your Grace, I always kneel before my queen.
please, stand up.
I am also your sister.
half sister.
Oh, James, you've grown a beard.
it suits you.
why didn't you tell me that you were coming?
there was no time.
your mother, Marie de Guise, is in trouble.
and she needs your help.
Yes, we fund her troubles.
Mary, this is real.
and the French help you sent hasn't proved a solution.
it's rather the problem.
well, I don't understand.
your mother is French, and so are half the men she has running Scotland's affairs.
scots want their affairs managed by men who share their nationality.
and they want it more passionately every day.
and why hasn't my mother attended to this problem?
I'm not sure she sees it or cares.
scots are a crude people to her.
in need of French leadership.
you have always resented my mother.
but she serves me.
are you sure it is not me that you truly resent?
are you sure it's not my rule you wish to change?
if it were, do you think I'd have come here to tip my hand?
then why are you here?
do you want me to tell my mother to bring more Scots into her government?
one will do.
for the moment.
who? You? - You.
scotland needs to see her queen.
to bow before her as I do, with pride and with duty.
come home to Scotland.
come home.
now? You want to go to Scotland now?
James says it's now or never.
the Scots feel occupied by their French allies.
if we don't act now,
it needs attention, I can see that.
but why does it need your attention in person?
so they can see that they still have a Scottish queen.
so I can strengthen my mother's rule.
and then, if that doesn't work, then to replace her, with someone who can rule for me.
well, then let me send diplomats.
let me help you determine the answers without sending you into the middle of so much unrest.
more Frenchmen?
to solve the problem of not enough Scots?
Mary, you convinced the cardinal to do business with us.
you can't leave in the middle of what you just started.
then finish it without me.
I told him we were the future of Scotland and France, you and I both.
you know perfectly well why he doesn't insist on meeting with Father.
he keeps asking for you.
he wants more of your flirting, your innuendos.
you want me to risk Scotland's health to continue some game?
to save France some embarrassment?
my father is mad.
france is unstable enough as it is.
if word gets out of his madness, this country could come apart.
Mary, I promise I will travel to Scotland with you.
just not now.
please wait until this deal is sealed and my father is better.
don't you see? I need you here with me, safe by my side, while France is in peril, and whilst we're trying to have a child.
an heir.
for France, of course.
stability... for France.
I don't just think of my country's needs.
I think of my wife's needs as well, but Scotland...
is one and the same.
my country and I are one and the same.
forget that, and you've forgotten who I am.
how are you... wife?
perfect... husband.
you?
husband and wife.
a family.
two families, really.
who'll have to meet, at some point, since the wedding was so quick.
tell me about your parents.
after breakfast, hmm?
I'm famished.
before I really begin to show.
are you quite sure it's safe for you to travel?
I thought maybe we ought to remain here a bit till everything's settled.
what needs to be settled?
I don't know.
living arrangements, paperwork... your dowry.
my dowry?
why wait on that?
because, otherwise, it could be months of delay.
so what?
we're both rich.
the money will follow us wherever we settle.
right.
of course you're right.
so tell me, where would you like to go on our tour?
I admire your disregard for others' opinions, but we have to consider how this looks.
you've been staying with me.
people will talk.
you saved me, Nostradamus.
if people want to talk, let them say that.
lady Kenna.
you distract me so.
what is it, hmm?
perhaps my new ring?
a wedding gift from my husband.
your son.
it's lovely.
I want it.
Henry, I'm your queen.
and it's so cute and tiny.
a compliment to your fine tastes.
it's not right.
I won't have it.
lady Kenna seems to need a wedding ring.
pardon? - A ring, Catherine.
here.
wonderful.
wear it in good health.
you shouldn't have to live like this.
true. But I'd also like you to live.
I'm too high-spirited to be a widow.
people will talk.
please.
you'll only make it worse.
he's moved on now. Go get some air.
I'm all right.
keep it.
a token of my sympathy.
Henry is not himself, and that woman is making life untenable, not only for us but for all of France.
for France?
the irony is, if Henry knew how close he was to exposing himself to his precious Vatican friends...
what are you talking about?
a plan to get rid of her.
I need your help to get rid of Penelope.
you mean, to kill her?
I wouldn't come to you if it were that simple.
Henry would suspect me; he'd have my head.
I don't need to be part of any of your schemes.
you do, for so many reasons, but I'll give you one that will appeal to you.
help me, and I'll help you and Sebastian...
an estate of your own, far from French court.
but it's more than just land: it's a chance for you
but why me?
would your plan just throw me back into bed with him?
not at all.
but it does involve sex.
and rather a mess of it.
sorry, I'm a bit spent.
you're hundreds of miles away.
scotland, I'm guessing?
some dire news brought by Mary's brother James?
he's convinced her she's needed in Scotland right away.
from the moment that I started to fall for her, this is what I feared most: that, someday, the needs of our countries would tear us apart.
wouldn't have mattered, except you married for love.
I wanted to believe that we could push past these problems, - work together. - And can't you?
mostly, yes.
but what happens when being a good king means being a bad husband?
that's simple: be a bad king.
that's why she wanted to marry you, isn't it?
she never wanted to marry me.
she wanted to save your life.
come on, you're smarter than that, and so is she.
Mary knew that you could promise her something that I never could, something that I warned her from the start.
you could put her first, always.
isn't that what love is?
to anyone but a king.
perhaps one of the original gems was lost and had to be replaced with a fake.
why not mention it to Julien?
he'll probably just have it repaired for you.
I don't want to stir up mistrust.
it seems like mistrust is already stirred up.
what happened?
whenever I mention meeting his parents or going to Hungary on our wedding tour, he changes the subject.
plenty of people would like to hide their parents.
me, for instance.
it's also the subjects he does seem keen on...
like my dowry.
well, it is a large sum.
for a rich man with a castle in Hungary, he seems awfully impatient to have it in hand.
what did your family tell you about him?
just that he was a very wealthy Hungarian who married two rich women.
both wives died, making him sad, but even richer.
and there was nothing suspect about his finances?
he gambled a bit, but all men do.
besides, you can't gamble away wealth like his.
my brother came awfully close.
talk to Julien.
you've both been so open till now.
well, yes and no.
when I told him I was pregnant but wouldn't say who the father was, he said he wouldn't ask about my past mistakes if I didn't ask about his.
I'm sure he meant nothing more than the usual male adventuring.
you wed quickly is all.
it's nerves, Lola. I'm sure of it.
Really?
that seems awfully far.
far from everything.
Olivia wants to find a new life with me.
you'd be taking her from all the comforts of court.
she's been through so much here.
we both have.
the years have been long and dark.
I'm thankful for the time I spent as your adviser, but I... I want to give her a new start.
you're trying to save her.
you've seen danger here.
my old friend, how can I say this?
I can't let you leave.
your gift of sight is invaluable to me, to the safety of France.
you can force me to stay...
but not to see.
you'll have me, but not my visions.
not if you cost me this last chance at happiness.
so you came to me as if I had a choice, - but clearly I don't. - You have choices.
and none will get you what you want from me.
I could take your life.
this is not a betrayal.
this is a friend saying good-bye.
I suppose I'll have to wish you luck, then.
you'll need it, you know.
if you think you're safe in the New World, you're wrong.
the land is soft and sweet, but filled with vipers.
I've been thinking, and I want to take you to Scotland with me.
Yes, I know, you told me that. But when?
next month? Next year? - Now.
as soon as we can.
it will need to be brief, and I'll need to finish my deal with the cardinal before we leave, and make sure that my mother can handle my father.
it won't be easy, may take a day or two.-- You're serious.
but what if we can't seal the deal with the Vatican?
what if your father gets worse? What... ?
what if my wife doesn't realize that I love her?
what if she doesn't see that I've put her first?
Francis, thank you.
I promise you'll be glad we went.
when Scotland is stronger, France will be stronger, too.
well, start packing.
and tell your brother that Scotland will soon greet her queen and her king.
both of you?
Really?
I thought you'd be pleased.
you wanted a queen for Scotland to bow to, and now you're getting more: a queen and a king.
a French king.
my king.
scotland's king.
who arrives with French soldiers, who even has "France" in his name.
James, this is silly.
Francis is strong and he's devoted to me and to Scotland.
when Scotland sees that with her own eyes, the crown will be stronger and so will my mother's position.
that's what you wanted, isn't it?
of course.
I apologize.
I worry too much.
scotland will celebrate her queen, even if she arrives with some fair-haired French baggage.
how soon can you leave?
Francis has some business to attend to, and then we'll leave.
I'll make arrangements immediately.
you seem worried, my darling.
are you having doubts?
no. I'm eager to go.
I've considered it for some time.
I've made mistakes.
I've misread prophecies and shared others where I probably shouldn't have.
sooner or later, the truth will catch up to me.
leaving is the right thing, for both of us.
I want you to know, whatever happens, - you've already... - Olivia!
beware of vipers.
she's beautiful, but damnably willful and headstrong.
and there's something not right about someone else telling me who to spend my life with.
not to mention she's been with a member of my own family.
forgive my lack of compassion, but I'm not sure whether you're bemoaning your situation with Kenna or mine with Mary.
that was Mimi Natalia, wasn't it?
Mary's brother's footman has expensive tastes in courtesans.
suspiciously expensive, I think.
it needs more.
more?
more red.
more lace.
to keep the king's eyes from wandering to, sad old habits.
Yes, Your Grace.
what do you want?
did you come here for this miserable little ring?
not at all. You can keep it.
I actually came here to help.
I find that hard to believe.
have you noticed that the queen makes no effort to have you removed?
she tried and she failed.
she's an artist with poisons.
if she wanted you dead, you'd be rotting by now.
no, you're alive because you serve a purpose:
you keep our poor mad king distracted.
he is unwell, yes.
I try to divert him from his pain.
well, you used to divert him.
until his mind wandered back to "sad old habits," like me.
you won't get him back, if that's what you're thinking.
I don't want Henry back.
I've seen what he does to playthings, once they start to bore him, and it's not pretty.
what's your point?
if you want to keep the king's interest and survive by his side...
then again, if you're unconcerned...
I'm listening.
have you tried blindfolds?
having him listen to the sound of your voice?
his Grace would follow me anywhere.
hot wax on his chest?
just his chest?
no wonder he tired of you.
the standing cross?
all I did was pay for the lady's services.
since when is that a crime?
it's rather how much you paid, and how you could afford it.
I told you, in thanks for a decade's service.
service to my wife's brother, the Earl of Moray.
but he's a Scot, and you're a Scot and there's...
a Queen Mary on this coin, but not my Queen Mary.
that gold isn't mine.
you're lying.
not a good start.
my men found this gold in your room, stitched into your valise.
would you care to explain to me why you're carrying English gold?
I don't know what you mean.
meeting the person who paid you this gold?
an Englishman?
an enemy of my wife's? - No.
I... I'm not from these parts.
I just wanted to see the village.
I don't want to hurt you, but trust me...
they do.
he admitted to having enough gold to pay for a courtesan, but denied that the gold hidden in his own bag was his.
he's lying; he has to be.
there are plenty of ways for a Scotsman to get ahold of English gold.
we still trade with the English.
then why so much of it, and why lie about it?
leave us.
for now. Which is why I came straight to you.
Mary, does none of this trouble you?
I trust my brother.
this footman could be a Protestant Scottish rebel, or work for the English, or both.
and whether James knows what his own man is up to or not, you aren't safe.
James will keep me safe.
are you so sure?
James is a Protestant...
he hates the French.
and many want to see him rule Scotland.
only one claim to power is stronger than his, - and that's yours. - If his claim is so strong, then why doesn't he topple my mother without warning me?
why bring me back to make his task that much more difficult?
you're assuming he wanted to see you home safely.
accidents happen at sea all the time.
then I will ask James about this.
and what if he's a part of it?
he'll lie and you'll learn nothing from it.
Mary, don't you need to know how much you can trust your own brother?
for the sake of your mother and for Scotland, give me a little time to find you some answers.
I want to take you to Scotland, but not if I'm leading us both into danger.
do it quickly.
there's a storm coming.
we need to leave soon.
wait.
I don't know about this.
what's wrong? Is the platform unsteady?
it's not that.
it doesn't feel right.
exactly. It's wrong.
you're a wicked old king, and you need to be cleansed of your sins.
please.
take me down.
Kenna said you would beg.
Oh, dear Kenna.
how I miss her kind face.
shut up.
Henry, I'm sorry. I tried to make him wait.
but the rumors...
the bishop insisted on seeing you. - Bishop?
don't you remember? This is Bishop Renauld, from Provence.
he came with the cardinal, the Pope's delegation.
your Grace. I... I cannot look.
this is, is blasphemy.
then close your eyes, you pious fool.
I will, but what of God?
don't bring...
don't bring Him into this.
but He is here...
he is everywhere; He sees this mockery!
if you turn from Him...
what if He turns from you?
but would He?
it is God's will that puts you here.
it is God's will that gives you your armies, your gold, your crown.
I see no righteousness here.
Henry, end this now.
send this witch away, - before her wickedness curses us all... - Wait!
they're in it together! Don't you see?
leave, Penelope.
Kenna and the queen...
Henry, they've got you twisted in knots!
it is you who have bound and twisted me.
get out.
what? - Now!
come, child.
while the king feels forgiving. - Henry, no!
come. - Get off me!
Henry, you poor thing.
look at you. - It all seemed so... so harmless.
Catherine... Catherine, I am lost.
I need God's support.
Absolutely.
wait.
where are your things?
I watched you pack.
where is the... ? I can't go with you.
what?
I don't...
you mean to send me off without you?
what's changed? Why would you do this?
my gift, it's truly a curse.
I can't escape its burdens, however far I run.
but you can.
and you must. - No.
I won't leave you. - You will.
I've seen it, Olivia.
I've seen you happy with someone else.
you're lying.
the vision that changed your mind, we both saw it, didn't we?
that snake was a message from Catherine.
she considers me a weapon she doesn't want to lose.
she will punish me for defying her.
she will kill you.
that is the cost of my leavingÔºöyour life.
that is her message.
but if we were far away...
there is no escaping her reach.
and what if I stayed?
and be shackled to a man enslaved to a wicked queen?
Oh, that is no life for you.
that is barely a life for me.
be free of this place that has caused you so much pain.
be free of me.
pardon.
time to go.
weather's turning.
no, no.
my cousins... will look after you.
I've sent them word.
start a new life.
and be happy.
a letter of credit has come from your father to the bank where I work.
with your word, I'll sign it, and your dowry will be moved to your husband's accounts.
just my word? - it's your father's request.
the money is not yours, of course.
women cannot hold such accounts.
Yes.
heaven knows what foolish things women might do with our own money.
gamble, buy prostitutes...
I beg your pardon?
what if I wait?
does the money stay safe in my father's accounts?
of course; but safe from what?
nothing.
hopefully.
I'll send word when I'm ready.
good day.
forgive me, Mary.
would've requested an audience, but I seem to have misplaced my footman.
is something wrong?
the storm is blowing in faster than I thought. - Yes.
I did notice the sky was darkening.
not that storm.
you've heard of the Lords of the Congregation?
those tiresome Protestant malcontents?
tiresome until they agree on something.
they've voted to start a rebellion.
a blockade will provoke a battle with Catholic authorities, and then they intend to remove your mother by force.
you couldn't have missed the weight of the gold in your valise.
you are guilty or covering for someone who is.
is it James?
shall I question your master?
fetch me his master, the earl.
take two dozen guards, and prepare for a fight.
you may kill if needs be. - No.
it's, it's not his gold.
who paid you then?
an Englishman?
very well.
where did you hear about this?
from your own envoy.
you can ask him yourself.
well, what can we do?
come home to Scotland.
leave now.
but Francis, he's not ready yet.
leave without him.
let him catch up.
he'll only be days behind us.
do you know what this gold tells me that you won't?
you're brave.
but your loyalty has a price.
you sold it once, why not sell it again?
will you talk if I promised you your freedom, plus three times the gold you were paid?
five times.
and a prince's oath that I will let you live.
Mary, I'm sorry to be so plain.
but you never knew our father as I did.
you never knew what he dreamed for you.
for your time on his throne.
I can't risk this marriage, this alliance, for a dead man's dreams, even my father's.
can you risk it for Scotland?
would you rather be the queen you were born to be or a pawn of the French court?
finish packing my things.
only enough for two weeks.
Francis can bring the rest, if he follows.
I'm leaving for Scotland. Today.
ten times the gold you were paid.
and you can buy all the courtesans you want.
and you swear I'll be spared?
I'll be set free?
if I believe your story, you'll be placed on the ship of your choosing, by my men.
and what happens to you after that is up to you.
I was paid to murder the Queen of Scots on her voyage home.
who paid you? - Englishmen.
I didn't know them, but I heard them talking.
they want James to be Scotland's king.
married less than a week, and you've already tired of me?
I don't feel well is all.
I... is it the baby?
no, I... I think it's just nerves.
there's... so much uncertainty.
the baby, my future... my husband...
you're uncertain about me?
I fear we don't know each other well.
is there anything weighing on you?
any troubles of yours a wife might share?
I... I'm sure, in time, we'll share everything.
you may even tell me who fathered your baby.
our baby.
or I may never ask.
because it may not matter.
what matters is how we feel about one another.
and I feel love for you.
I know it all happened very quickly, but that's where we are.
together.
with our secrets. - With our pasts.
I swear, if I believed knowing every single thing about one another could protect us from future troubles,
I would tell you every moment of my past.
but... my life... this... wonderful life, began the day you agreed to be my bride.
then why do I feel afraid?
because life is full of uncertainty.
that's why we love.
to face it with someone.
together.
let's face life together, Lola.
you and me.
can we?
my father believed that actor was part of the Vatican delegation.
you did it.
and now you're saying we're rich?
well, richer than we were.
that estate that Henry promised Penelope belonged to Catherine;
she's given it to us.
she also let me keep her ring.
well, you have everything you wanted: land, money, jewelry...
practically everything.
I was able to get this back as well.
Penelope looked so pathetic, back in the kitchen.
yet still, I couldn't resist.
should I buy you a new ring, now that we can afford it?
no, you fool, you gave it to me.
such a queer feeling, whenever I look at it.
what's that?
a sort of certainty.
one I've never felt before.
someone's always going to be looking out for me now, no matter what.
I'm not sure you need looking out for.
well... I'm stuck with him, aren't I?
might as well put him to some kind of use.
leave... me alone.
get... out.
please!
go.
will my sins never leave me?
did the footman tell you that James was involved with the plot?
no, but can you take that chance?
I take that chance every day.
the English are constantly plotting against me.
if they want a Protestant king in Scotland, of course they would choose James.
but do you really think that he had no inkling of this?
his own man in the pay of your enemies?
James has written to me of dozens of plots against me.
plots that were to his benefit.
he tells me because he wants what is best for Scotland.
as he knows I do.
Mary, please, we will go later, when it is safe.
my mother is in jeopardy now.
scotland is in jeopardy now.
I said we'll go when it's safe.
we will never be safe.
I know that you're afraid this is a trap.
I am, too.
but I need to take this chance.
I have to.
I will be home soon.
please trust me.
I can't.
guards! Surround the queen.
what are you doing?
locked in the tower?
did you think that I would try to slink out of my rooms, like a rat in a passageway?
not like a rat.
like a defiant queen.
you will be released as soon as your brother has cast off.
I told him that we'd follow as soon as we could.
so, you lied? - It is not a lie.
when I know that it is safe to...
it will be too late!
we both know that day will never come.
I will not help you with the cardinal, if that's what you think.
I know.
my mother and I will do what we have to; we'll find a way.
you may hate me right now, but I have done this for you.
I love you, and I've put you first.
you love a girl!
you don't love a queen or you would allow me to be one!
you are putting yourself and your country first, just as you always have!
that is not true.
if Scotland falls, I will never forgive you!
you will lose my country, and you will lose me!
I warned you, Francis...
we are one and the same.
scotland won't fall.
and neither will we.
I can't hear another word. Get out!
I'll be back when you've had a chance to calm down.
you can't just leave me locked in here... Francis!
is that my husband's child?
LOLA: You were engaged to Bash. If you tell Francis,
I essentially become his.
GREER: You're a servant.
nothing can ever happen between us.
remember this as the moment that you threw your happiness away.
so let's have that drink now.
father, my evening took the loveliest turn.
guard: The king is dead! Long live the king!
guard 2: The king is dead! Long live the king!
tell me your darkest truth, and I will tell you mine.
Lola is giving birth. You are the father of her child.
the time is now. We need to think like queens.
Mary: You are going to a village which has likely been exposed to plague. You can't leave.
your friend, my child.
perhaps my only child.
Mary: It is upon us now, an old and faceless foe.
we have confirmed reports that the Black Death has returned - once more to plague our lands.
Catherine: You needn't fear.
only take care.
where is our young king?
king Francis is safe.
he is protected in a private home.
you are all protected.
I have ordered the castle be made secure to prevent the arrival of infection.
what if the plague's already here?
Catherine: Anyone who is sick will be treated with dignity and kindness.
Catherine's being too nice. What she'll really want is the sick rooted out or turned in by their neighbors.
there are early signs.
fevers.
the expulsion of blood.
but more commonly, aches, pains, bulbous sores that will burst.
the blackening of extremities.
contact with others spreads the disease.
Aloysius, is that your daughter with Leith?
are they together?
it can't be.
I'm not jealous. I'm worried.
why is that?
leith made a sort of vow when things ended.
that he'd attain wealth and station and that I would be forced to witness his rise and happiness with another.
you think that's why he's sought out my daughter.
GREER: I don't know.
there. That's my father, and that's his fianc√©e.
LEITH: That's your father?
I'll be back.
Catherine: And none have fallen ill among us. The queen can confirm this.
no one at court has shown signs of the plague, not one.
and I pray none will.
we are prepared, and we are in the best position to survive.
: we are far from prepared. How could we be?
where is Francis?
I tried to stop him, but I was too late.
I've sent guards, ones that can be trusted with the knowledge - that the king is not safe... - Mary!
can you tell us what's happening?
we have taken precautions.
as far as we know, no one here has gotten sick.
as queen, I will need to be isolated.
I can't stay with you. I'm so sorry.
GREER: Are you all right?
where is Francis, really?
he wouldn't leave you. Not now.
Lola sent word. She's having the baby.
there are... problems with the birth.
will she be all right?
I don't know. All I know is that she is my friend, and Francis is my husband.
and God willing, there is an innocent new life.
I tried to stop him from going to her when I found out about the plague.
but he went anyway.
you were trying to protect him.
and now I must protect his people. - GREER: Mary, your task is to survive.
that's what Francis would want.
when were you going to tell me? - I had no idea
lord Castleroy is your father until you pointed him out.
but then you were off to him before I could even stop you.
off to my father and his fianc√©e.
I met Greer just a few days ago.
I liked her.
it's over.
I wouldn't have pursued you in any way if it weren't or if I'd known who you are.
if you could be with her now, would you?
I can honestly say I would not.
these could be our last days on Earth.
spend them with me.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
we could... hide away somewhere, away from everyone.
Yvette, this isn't wise.
a rooftop somewhere. I don't care.
we'll bring food and blankets.
there's things I must do.
tomorrow then.
I'll find you. - You should be away from others.
if you're exposed, you risk...
I know. I know.
but you can't come to me at my father's suites.
there's a family, old friends.
I'll make an excuse to check in on them and wait for you there.
I don't know, Yvette.
I'll send word once I'm there.
I just spoke with Mary, and they are isolating people merely for seeming unwell.
of course they are. They have to.
and if anyone is truly ill with plague, chaos will follow.
there isn't enough food. Not for every household at court.
not for the weeks it will take for the disease to burn itself out or the famine that will surely follow.
you're not an optimistic fellow, are you?
I've had food brought to our chambers, as much as I could demand in good conscience.
kenna, you have to find Pascal and secure yourselves until the plague has passed or passed us over.
how long will that take? - Weeks.
maybe longer.
you should go. Now.
I'll find you after I confer with the kingsguard.
why you? Because Francis isn't here, and I know the chief of the guards. They're scared, too.
but they need to know they're accountable for their actions when this is over.
man: My wife's going to be furious. Some court gathering.
but I'd die without your company.
so would I.
man: Your Majesties, my apologies for missing the gathering. I...
not today, sir.
my lord, please join us.
who are you?
it's all right. I know him.
you're alive.
Yes.
to my surprise.
so is the child, thank God.
it's a boy.
you have a son.
and here we are...
the two of us.
it's been hours. Why hasn't Francis returned?
speak freely. The king's guards are sworn to secrecy.
surely he saw signs of the plague before he got too far.
and why would he go on just to help one of your ladies?
and where are the guards that you sent?
delayed, clearly, - or deserted. - Or dead.
the music.
that's the signal that someone has fallen ill.
it's begun.
less than half a day since we announced the threat.
whoever is sick was already here, which means there will be more to follow.
but the airs near us will be burned clean.
it worked for the Pope.
who is it? Who has fallen ill?
a stablehand. The sores are already in evidence. He'll be dead within a day, two if his body can endure the suffering.
I heard you sent guards for Francis.
I asked for volunteers.
as they have not returned, I would like to volunteer.
why you?
because he believes himself immune to the plague.
the young family you lost.
I've had the misfortune of living in two regions of outbreak. And I should have died with them, but I did not.
Lola's letter said she was at the house - just north of the mill? - Yes, but...
there is unrest and many other dangers besides illness.
and if any have befallen my son, who has risked so much for your friend...
unless there's another reason why he has rushed to her side.
tell me, Mary, is there? - Do not taunt me or seek to sew discord.
not this day.
Nostradamus is willing to risk his life to save our king, my husband and your son.
thank him and say good-bye.
I order you as your queen, show your gratitude and then grant me your silence.
thank you,
Pascal, stop. I've been looking for you for hours.
come on, we have to go.
the servants seem to be scattered.
I'm merely asking this one to help fetch some food from a larder.
he's no servant... he's my ward. - I need help.
my wife's taken shelter with other family.
I'm on my own. - He's coming with me.
it's girls like you who get men like me locked away from our wives - in the first place. - What does that mean?
whores.
you were the king's whore.
he's dead. You're nobody now.
I am married to the current king's brother.
I am a lady. - Queen Mary's disgraced lady, wed to the bastard with a title designed to make everyone laugh. I ought to have you whipped.
I'll do it.
I'll fetch whatever you need and then
I'll come back to our quarters, all right?
Pascal, you don't have to do this.
I'll come right back, I swear.
no thank you, Estelle.
you need to sleep, Lady Lola.
you've lost too much blood.
the carriage outside... is it yours?
Yes.
there was a driver, but he left on foot when he heard of the plague. To be with his family.
I know that's where you'd like to be as well. At Mary's side.
I came thinking that you might be dead and my child might be alone in this world.
well, that would be simpler.
that's not what I wanted. I'm saying that
I didn't have a moment to think.
and I resent you for lying to me.
I am king, I should be at my court with my wife.
you could have taken the child straight back to the castle.
it is your right. - The boy who sent for the midwife said the bridge was out.
I'd have to cut around the east village, hard hit by plague.
it would take more than a day to return.
how would I keep a newborn alive without its mother?
I see you've considered the possibility.
and yet...
you haven't touched the baby. It's all right to admit that you don't want this. I know you don't.
no one beyond this room need know the truth of this child's parentage.
my poor Julien is dead, but the child will have his name.
you have it all sorted out, don't you?
you and Mary.
George, your fingers.
LOLA: Oh, Lord, he has the plague.
we have to leave. Now.
it's for the babe.
it wasn't near my brother.
you didn't touch him either, did you? You should leave this house.
you could ride one of the horses.
I can't leave my family.
you'll die.
pardon my saying so, but...
I'd be no safer on my own, or with the king of France.
you'd do better with guards.
or lying about who you are.
godspeed to you both.
Mary: Lord Eduard, how may we help you?
many of the nobles have secured themselves.
others prefer to drink in the gallery as if nothing is wrong, but the death count mounts.
do you know how many are dead so far?
fourteen.
14, here on our first day of contagion.
how many will be dead when we wake tomorrow?
do you count the lower class?
I count every life lost.
now what do you want?
to add another to the pile.
I'm sorry to be so abrupt, but while my enemy is accessible I need to strike.
I don't understand. - There's someone I thought untouchable.
I'd like him to die of plague.
put him in one of the mass holding cells.
he'll be infected soon enough, and no one will heed his cries.
you come here and blatantly request we murder your foe?
if it were a request I wouldn't be so blatant.
it's more of a demand.
one I have no doubt you will grant.
and what will you gain?
vengeance.
pierre Voland beds my new wife, and with some frequency.
his father's a close friend of my father's, they engage in trade as well.
I'd kill him myself, or have someone do it, but I fear reprisal.
what, from your father?
if your vengeance cost him money.
Catherine, that's enough.
don't you want to know the details?
what's at stake?
what kind of animosity lurks within your realm?
here are the details.
but more than that, the castle relies on our weekly deliveries.
these deliveries happen when I signal that I've been paid.
nobles have raided the stores of food.
you need this week's delivery to happen.
or they may reach for your necks.
food for survival in exchange for one life, easily taken. I leave you to consider the opportunity.
welcome to your rule, my queen.
and welcome to the real France.
is that how you and Henry have maintained your rule?
by bowing to your nobles?
it's simple math.
if one life saves more, you have your answer.
one life matters. Every life matters.
we will find grain elsewhere.
I don't think you understand who Eduard is.
he comes from a large, wealthy family with many holdings.
but your power comes from nobles...
from the regions that only they can control.
we have order, food and money because they grant it to us. And in exchange, we grant them certain privileges. Deny Eduard, and you and Francis will pay a very high price.
Francis would never agree to this.
he hasn't been king yet.
we can punish Eduard, claim his grain.
claim a noble's property?
others will revolt.
the death could be painless,
I can help with that. One death, and you'll forget about it when you see your hungry are fed.
I won't forget about it. I have sacrificed lives before, and every one takes me a step further away from the person I want to be.
the person you are...
is Queen.
and a favor for a favor keeps you on the throne.
that is your way.
I want to be a different kind of queen.
one that my husband is proud of.
send word to Lord Eduard.
tell him that I have considered his request and that it has been denied.
I don't blame you for suspecting otherwise.
given what I said to you.
but meeting Yvette was blind chance.
I didn't know she was Castleroy's daughter, I swear.
really. What are the odds?
don't you understand, if you married her, you would be in my life. My son-in-law.
even before that, we'd be forced to see each other, to pretend there's nothing between us, and...
maybe there wouldn't be for you. Maybe there isn't.
for I will fail. I will make a terrible mistake and I will be destroyed.
I was on my way to meet her.
please don't.
Francis, the baby... I... I can't feed him.
I need water. I need to drink something or else...
we're not the only ones here, are we?
FRANCIS: No, we're not.
let me talk to them.
what's wrong with her?
we're not infected.
we just need to pass and get to the lake.
she's not sick. She's just given birth.
no need for that.
unless you use it as a walking stick you lean against as you bow. Which I recommend we all do, as this is our new king.
you look familiar.
my name is Louis, and we're cousins.
many times removed. I've seen you at court.
relax.
you're safe now, among loyal subjects.
and a few mutts that bark long before they bite.
have you seen my wife?
no.
but I'm as bleary-eyed as you look.
there have been desertions. I was up all night managing the security of the lockdown.
that's what you should tell your wife to do.
lock down in your quarters and stay there. - I did.
she left a note saying she was going out this morning.
trying to find the child we care for. - MAN: Quickly, now, secure Lord Voland and his family.
you've made things very difficult.
a noble fell ill in the gallery.
now he's locked in there with his entire household.
I don't see how you could get to him without killing the others as witnesses.
did you not receive my message?
I did. And I'm giving you the chance to reconsider.
as the landscape has quite literally changed.
look outside.
villagers all around are burning the homes of the infected.
now the fires are burning out of control.
those other holdings you were counting on.
we have no grain.
after the plague has passed, a famine will spread across the land. Many will die.
and their deaths will be on you.
there now, that's better.
all I needed was a bit of water and all you needed was milk.
your cousin's been generous.
how long are they planning to stay here?
he says until the plague has passed.
and then they'll return home.
he rules over a region two days' travel from here.
it'll be rough terrain that they'll cross, but his men and horses will be well-rested.
it could be days for us.
would it really have been so awful to tell me the truth?
I would have been angry with myself, not you.
I tried to handle the situation on my own, to save you and Mary from complication.
because you wanted your freedom.
I know you, Lola. We shared more than a bed in Paris, and I know how you feel about court.
you didn't want to be tied to it or to me.
I don't blame you.
there's little for you in it. And one night should not define your life. Or mine.
but I would have liked to have been consulted in the choice.
so forgive me if I no longer consult you in mine.
the lie of his paternity can stand.
when this is done, I... I could be on my way with my son, - not yours. - Enough.
I know that you have been through terrible hardship.
the truth is that child is whoever I say he is.
Pascal, are you here?
there you are. I've been looking everywhere for you. What happened?
I wanted to come back to you, but he wouldn't let me leave.
I brought him food and water.
are you hurt? What's happened?
when I held the cup to his lips...
he started coughing.
is that his blood on you?
I can't swallow and my bones hurt.
it's all right.
Pascal, you have to listen to me.
I'll take you someplace safe with food and water where I can look after you.
and we have to keep you away from pe...
guards!
they're infected! No, no, no! No!
guards! No!
no, no, no, wait!
I'm one of the queen's ladies! Please,
I'm not sick! No!
No!
they will slip away into peaceful sleep like so many families caught by this terrible plague.
just slip away?
I will not condone the murder of innocents.
did you find them... Francis and Lola?
many roads are blocked.
it wasn't until dawn that I found the mill house where they went. The neighbors had set fire to it.
and the painted red "X" of the plague was on the door.
is that all? Didn't you look inside?
I'm immune to the plague, my queen, but not fire.
but if they were inside, - between the disease and the flames... - Maybe they left.
sought shelter elsewhere.
until I see proof,
I know they are alive. They have to be.
Yes.
I don't want to believe it either.
but you're right... for you, Francis must survive.
what do you mean?
if even a whisper of this news gets out, all eyes will turn from you to the future, to the next king after Francis, to me, as regent, as Charles is but a child.
you have just found out that your eldest son might be dead, and your first instinct is to seize power?
I've only had one instinct ever, and that is to protect my family and their birthright, which is their rule.
I'll provide food with a painful but needed sacrifice.
I'll deal with the Volands and, unlike you, - When Francis returns... - He will thank me for saving his realm from his very naive young queen.
lord Narcisse.
lord Narcisse. I know that name.
he controls land around here. - More and more every day.
Narcisse, what brings you here?
same as you, Lord Conde.
clean air and water. I'm heading north, where the plague hasn't yet spread.
but that doesn't explain what our new king is doing here.
Majesty.
I am Stephan Narcisse. I was a friend of your father's.
the king was reviewing cathedral repairs when the roads were cut off by the plague.
I offered my hospitality while he waits to return to the castle.
I see.
very kind of you, Conde.
we found the girl alone near her house, with a red "X" marked on the door.
LOLA: Estelle. - Her family were dying of the plague, the neighbors already gathering animal fat - to set the roof ablaze. - My God, why is she in a cage?
I realize it looks... barbaric, keeping a girl where my livestock should be, but the bars are simply to isolate her until we know that she's not infected.
then she'll be released.
had we left her there, she would surely have died.
my heart couldn't bear the thought.
I wouldn't get too close, milady.
if she is infectious, then you would have to be isolated, too.
and then you couldn't feed your baby.
water your horses, then yourselves.
why did you make up that story about the cathedral?
this is not a man you share secrets with.
why don't you like him? What has he done?
some nobles build fortunes with hard work or by serving the crown.
others find shortcuts.
Ah.
CONDE: I'd be curious to know if the girl's family lived long enough to die of plague.
you'll know if Narcisse winds up with their lands.
Conde. Oh, safe voyage on your boat.
I hear it's finally arrived, waiting for you.
Oh. Did Lord Conde not mention that he has a boat waiting for him up north to escape the plague?
no?
I would have thought he would offer his new friend the king the same chance of survival as his own. Be careful of this one, Majesty.
he's ambitious.
a new king needs to know who his real friends are, especially at times like this.
Pascal, I can't hear you.
I think I fell asleep.
would you like me to sing you another song?
I had a dream.
I saw my mother.
you did?
she was younger, though.
she looked... like you.
she said she'd care for me.
or was that you?
we've both been blessed to care for you.
you're a wonderful boy and a good soul, and you are and always were loved.
Pascal, God loves you, too.
Pascal, can you hear me?
God will love you, too.
if you can hear my voice, answer me!
woman: I'm here! Help! Kenna.
I'm so thirsty. - No, you can't go that way. That's the gallery.
you can't go in there. - Please, I want to go.
it's full of people.
man: My lord.
stay back.
I'm surely infected, too.
Oh, no. - Thank you for coming.
that's close enough.
I'm stricken.
I don't know how it happened.
I was so careful. - Is there anything I can do?
oddly, you've already done it.
I can meet my maker with less blood on my hands.
your hesitation to take a life has saved me from taking many.
I simply didn't have time before falling ill to murder that household.
there's something else you should know.
I didn't want to be me either.
well, I blame Henry. Being a queen unloved by your king is excruciating.
and dangerous.
Henry loved you.
some.
once.
not enough.
not the way that Francis loves you. An indiscretion, even a child, doesn't have to get in the way of a marriage.
don't let Lola come between you.
because you are nothing but a guest in this court without the support of your king.
it worked.
how long will her symptoms last?
the dose I gave her will only last a day or two.
and then she will have a miraculous recovery.
we can only pray she doesn't suspect our hand.
you have risked much to help me.
death already walks the halls freely here.
and to see Catherine feed it more souls...
I couldn't save my own family, but I can save this one.
I was dishonest with you.
I understand why you didn't tell me about the boat.
it's like an ark in a great flood.
if word got out, it could be overrun or taken from you.
that lady sparkling by the fire is my mistress, Lady Doutzen of Amsterdam.
she's married.
I'm not.
but we share in the sin and so much more.
when people started dying, I promised her a safe voyage home.
some of my men will go with her.
the other passengers are members of her household, her children.
there's still room for one more mistress and her child.
lady Lola is not my mistress.
I love my wife.
if you love your wife, put them on the boat.
lady Lola could marry again.
and the child won't grow up like your brother...
a bastard spoken of in scornful whispers.
you'll have others.
I know what it is to make a mess of love.
go back to your wife.
without the poison of a lover and a bastard child.
Conde's boat is leaving in the morning.
you can accompany them to the Netherlands and then continue on.
you can live your own lives.
what will you do?
I'm going to ride out in the morning.
I have to get back to Mary.
finally.
still waiting on your handsome young soldier?
Shh.
I'm not so sure he's coming.
but I haven't given up hope just yet.
Mary: Eduard Narcisse, I have brought you here to tell you that Lord Voland's family is not to be harmed under any circumstances.
where is the queen mother?
I am the queen of France, and you are my subject.
what is your real grievance with Lord Voland?
even you wouldn't slaughter an entire household for a woman.
this could have been so much cleaner for me and for you.
I'm not the kind of man who likes to get his hands dirty.
one favor...
it's all I asked. One life.
but now so many.
what did you do?
after I found the poison, I found the dumbwaiter, which delivered the water directly into their locked suite.
Oh, God, no.
Mary: They're all dead.
poisoned.
find out who each and every member of this household is.
for even the servants' families deserve to know.
dear God, stop their suffering.
you there...
child, are you all right?
wait. I know you.
you gave me back my Clementine before when she fell.
they've all fallen now. So much suffering.
what's happened to you?
why aren't you with your family?
are you dead?
girl: Yes.
am I? Was I infected?
no.
you'll live.
but I'm not sure where I'm supposed to be.
the same is true of many others, and they're angry.
we're not leaving. Not till we're done.
done? With what?
there will be a reckoning.
I didn't realize you...
that I was having you followed?
I knew you would signal for the grain.
I was right about you.
you don't want to risk my husband's ire.
it's one thing to murder a foe...
an entire household.
another to starve his court, so, let's put it behind us.
take him. Make sure he's unarmed. - Why?
you can't change anything. It's done.
Yes, it is... and by your own admission.
murder is a very serious crime.
even during a plague, when it seems some people believe that a little extra death shouldn't trouble us.
the Volands are already gone.
you may have this shipment of grain, but what about the next?
why make an enemy out of those you need most?
what do you gain? - Justice.
take him away.
you're wasting your time!
my father will free me!
no, he won't... because he'll never find you.
kenna, can you hear me?
KENNA: Bash! Bash? Is anyone here?
Kenna? Kenna, is that you?
is that you? Bash!
it's all right. I'm here. I'll free you.
Hurry! - Stand back.
- Oh, Bash.
Oh, thank God you came!
I was afraid you were dead.
I was afraid we both were.
Oh, Bash, Pascal...
he was infected, and now he's gone.
well, it's over now.
you're all right. We're both all right.
the ship is two days' ride from here, with frequent stops for rest.
your friend and her baby will manage the trip comfortably.
I'm grateful.
Lola, he's crying.
come on, don't cry.
all right, then.
shh, shh.
LOLA: I'm sorry.
I went to fetch water for the trip.
he was asleep when I left.
the party is mounting up.
riders will follow to carry your things, my lady.
thank you.
I understand all the reasons, I do. I ju...
I just can't.
you can't leave on that boat.
you won't take away my son.
EDUARD: You're taking me to the catacombs.
that's where the sick are locked up.
if you put me down here, I'll die!
Mary: I'm aware. - I'm what this realm needs.
nobles like my father Lord Narcisse gave the crown to your husband's family. They can take it away.
you're making a mistake!
and your husband will hate you for it.
as soon as he learns how the world works, how it's always worked.
open the door, put him inside.
his mother knows it.
so did his father.
his heart beats with their blood, and there is nothing older or stronger than royal blood.
you'll see.
No! No!
No! Mary!
No!
: No!
I never was much for the holidays.
been forever since I'd known a holiday, since I'd seen my family, since I'd been with a girl, since I'd driven a car.
you see, cars are what put me here.
iron Mountain, maximum security.
I was riding a hard 5 for grand theft auto.
meanwhile, most of my esteemed raping and murdering colleagues were up for parole in 3.
world works like that sometimes.
all the time, in my experience.
that's me, Rudy Duncan, menace to society, on the left.
guard: Move it out!
the guy on the right's Nick Cassidy, my best friend.
back then, we were both looking at 3 days to a new start.
that's what you talk about in prison.
how you're gonna get it right.
how you'll never make the same mistakes.
we walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do?
hot chocolate.
what?
that's the first thing I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go out and get myself a mug of hot chocolate.
and a piece of pecan pie, right?
that's right. A piece of pecan pie.
Yeah. She's gonna be out there, man.
she's gonna be right there. Right there, waiting.
P. A. Emmett Johnson, report back to your cellblock.
she got us a motel on highway 5.
lock ourselves in the whole week, drinkin' wine, takin' baths, man.
huh?
Yeah.
you know, Nick, all those pictures she sent, you sure that's really her in the pictures?
cause I did hear sometimes these girls send pictures that's not really them.
it's like their prettier, you know, cousin' or something like that.
why you gotta say a thing like that, man?
Ah, I'm just saying, you know, I heard that.
Why? Why you gotta say a thing like that?
I'm just saying, I mean, uh...
you know, maybe I should take her out.
spend a day or two with her.
make sure she's the right girl.
just a day or two.
maybe a night or two?
Yeah. Whatever it takes. Just make sure you're getting the right merchandise, you know.
Yeah, you know what?
enjoy your hot chocolate, Rudy.
think I'll take my chances with Ashley.
Yeah, I figured. I figured.
P. A. Shower release, first tier.
guard: Hold up. Hold.
P. A. Pop gate 3.
Rudy: Oh, shit.
what's up?
Alamo's back.
Nick: Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
bro, I'm fucked.
pincher said he thinks I'm the one who ratted him out for beating up Creed, 'cause I was there.
he thinks I'm the reason he ended up in solitary.
fuck, Rudy.
guard: Move out!
guard: And stop!
move in!
Nick: Listen to this.
I've made my list, and I've checked it twice, "and as long as you're naughty, it's gonna be nice.
all that gets me through the day "is to close my eyes and imagine holding you, "kissing you...
touching you, "because I know I'll feel at that moment
I've found the reason for my whole entire life.
she sounds pretty mature for 25.
Yeah.
you grow up in Detroit, you get mature real quick.
Yeah. Either that or those pictures are 10 years old.
Uhh!
sure as hell don't make me miss Millie Bobeck.
guess I owe Millie, though.
if I hadn't been rolling her,
I would've never ended up here.
Yeah. You hadn't cracked that guy's head open, you never would have found true love.
jealous.
you know, Nick, what if she sees you, and, you know, you just don't do it for her?
you know, I mean physically.
Rudy: She just... you know, it's not there.
what are you gonna do?
well... me and her, we got a connection.
Oh, Jesus Christ. Get this fuckin' shit out of my face.
you should've written to that magazine, Rudy.
Oh, I should've, yeah.
I'm gonna walk outta here,
I'm gonna walk right into a relationship, and you, my friend, will walk out with the bus fare...
searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
that's right.
morning, gorgeous. More eggnog?
should've written, Rudy.
you could have got yourself a girl.
Yeah. Should've done a lot of things.
all I want is just to make it back to Sidnaw, sit down for Christmas dinner, sleep in my old bed, watch some ball games with my old man, eat leftovers for about 6 months.
I thought you hated that place.
some of my dad's Christmas turkey.
Nick: Yeah, what makes you think your dad'll forgive you?
well, he said I'd pay for it.
you know?
me and my easy money.
that's what he called it.
after wasting 5 years of my fuckin' life,
I'd have to say the guy had a point.
Ohh.
5 years, man.
I did my time.
I just want to go home.
guard: Keep the line moving!
what's this?
holiday Jell-O.
what's this shit in it?
swallow it and ya see.

thinking he might be able to help get me some work.

Nah.
Nah, I'm through with that shit.
Ashley's right, I gotta start doing something
I got a stake in.
get a business going.
I don't know, man.
I've been in the business world.
hot-wiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business.
chop shop consultant" doesn't work on a resume.
Rudy: All right.
Nick: I just wanted to be the boss of something, you know?

Oh, man, what's wrong with you?
monsters...

it's just a roach, Zook.
Yeah, it's protein. It's good for you.
monsters...

guard: Hey, Zook! Sit the fuck down!
Zook: Monsters... in... the gelatin!

Hey! Jesus!

Ooh ha!

Uhh!
guard: Sit down! Don't move!

Inmate: I didn't do nothing, man! Be cool!
Inmate: You want some fucking monster?
Inmate: Eat this, cocksucker!

Nick: Just stand there! Don't move, don't move!

Uhh!
guard: Down!

Inmate: Yeah, I want some company, too!
guard: Open outer gate!
guard: Your world, and welcome to it, you dumb fucks!

over here.
boy: Mom.
man: Hey, baby. Looking good.
woman: Jesus!
man: Claudia?
woman: Hey. You look good.
come over here. Hey. How you doing?
Nick, voice-over: "All that gets me through the day "is to close my eyes and imagine holding you, "kissing you, touching you.
don't do it, Rudy.
don't you fuckin' do it.
Mmm, baby.
Rudy: Jesus Christ.
you Ashley?
I'm Nick.
Etta James: # At last #
# My love has come along #
# My lonely days #
# Are over #
how's your coffee?
# And life is like a song #
it's good.
jeez, it's got to be about 10 degrees out there.
the radio said negative 5.
Rudy: Negative 5?
Yeah.
I don't think it's negative 5.
the radio said.
Oh, windchill, you know, is probably what they meant.
windchill factor.
Yeah.
look, Ashley, I'm sorry.
I, uh, I was scared that I was gonna walk out there and you were gonna take one look at me and just turn around.
Rudy: You know, I was scared
I was walking into heartache.
all those letters and all those words, and you have a picture in your mind, and...
I was scared you'd see me, and I just wouldn't be that...
Rudy: picture that you had in your mind.
I figured you walked out of there and you saw my clothes or something, and you just walked right the other way.
you know, maybe you saw my coat or my hair...
Oh, hey, I like your coat.
maybe you, um...
maybe you saw me, and I didn't...
Rudy: Ashley... no.
that was me.
I thought you said you had curly hair.
I do. It's very curly.
when it gets long, it's really curly, but I had to cut it short.
I can grow it back out again, if you want.
I mean, I can get, you know, pretty bushy.
no. No, no, no.
I want you to be who you want to be.
do that again.
what?
smile like that.
come on, one more time.
God, I have been dreaming about that smile...
for so long...
Ashley Mercer.
# At last #
you're better than the pictures in my mind, Nick.
you're real.
Dean Martin: # Oh, the weather outside is frightful #
# But the fire is so delightful #
# And since we've no place to go #
# Let it snow, let it snow let it snow #
# Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping #
# And I've brought me some corn for popping #
# The lights are turned way down low #
# Let it snow #
# Let it snow #
# When we finally kiss good night #
# How I'll hate going out in the storm #
# But if you really hold me tight #
# All the way home I'll be warm #
# And the fire is slowly dying #
# And, my dear we're still good-bye-ing #
# But as long as you love me so #
# Let it snow, let it snow and snow #
can I ask you something?
Mmm?
this the first time you ever done something like this?
you... oh, look at you.
you're so pretty, sweet.
why you writing to some con you don't even know?
I told you, Nick, remember?
tell me again.
all the guys I've ever been with, they never wanted to get to know me.
who I am, inside.
they just wanted to get inside.
guy like you, Nick...
God, I mean, 6 months before you can even touch my face.
I figure a guy like that was gonna have to work to get to know me some other way.
but when I read what you wrote to me,
I said...
here's a guy they say is a criminal, but he's not.
just protected his girl.
I mean, somebody got killed, but...
he's not a killer.
cause he did what he had to do to save somebody.
and the world just didn't see it that way.
state of Michigan, anyway.
you wrote me some wonderful things, Nick.
it wasn't all me, you know.
Aw, it was all you.
the guy I was in with, you know, he helped me with some of the, you know, some of the romantic stuff.
he's a good guy, actually. You'd like him. Ha.
I'm talking about the heart...
not the words.
Yeah, well...
some of the heart might have been his, too.
yeah?
he should have signed his name, then he'd be here right now.

merry Christmas! Ho ho ho!
ASHLEY: Mmm-ah!
merry Christmas, Santa! Whoo!
Rudy: Leave Santa alone!
provisions, Nick.
what? - Provisions!
Oh, we are going to be naked, drinking cold champagne, but we are not leaving that motel room till after New Year's.
OK, well, I think we got enough stuff.
come here, you need a coat.
no boyfriend of mine is gonna walk around in a negative-5-degree windchill without a good-looking goddamn coat.
Yeah, but I... you already got me all this stuff.
I didn't get you anything.
Nick, you got out.
you're here.
you're my Christmas.
it's $200, Ash.
ha ha, I know.
but you forget where I work.
beauty and fragrances.
Yup. 50% off, my friend.
ho ho ho.
just until the holidays, Nick.
you know, we'll let her have her holidays, then we'll tell her.
P. A.:Attention, shoppers...
ASHLEY: Hey, Nick.
Yeah.
you know what I was thinking?
what?
well, after our little holiday hideaway, maybe instead of going back to Detroit, we can go gambling.
don't you think that'd be fun?
you know, drive up to that Indian place you used to work at.
I don't know about that.
what are you talking about?
I haven't gambled in forever.
I got some luck, you know?
blackjack, Nick, blackjack I'm good at.
and they'd give us some free games, wouldn't they since you worked there?
whoa, I worked security.
I don't think they're going to be rolling out the red carpet for me.
Yeah, slots...
Whoo! Baby, am I good at slots.
you don't even know.
it would be so much fun. Come on.
you can't be good at slots. You just pull the handle.
no, but we'll walk in there like high rollers.
you know, it'll be fun.
look, Ash, we're not going anywhere I used to work.
OK? That's it.
OK.
I'm sorry. I just...
you know, I thought maybe you had friends there, and you'd like to see them.
Hey, it's OK. I just... look, you know...
I've been in prison for 2 years.
those guys really don't want to see me.
trust me.
well, they don't know what the hell they're missing.
I'm gonna tell them not to bother us for the rest of the year.
when I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.

# Da-da # # A gift to give a king #

Ohh!
Hi, Nick.
Aah! Ah, shit.
I owe you a drink.
Uhh!
welcome home, Nick.
look, man, you don't know me.
ho ho ho. Oh, I know you.
I know you real well.
you can't.
uhh, the hell I can't.
ASHLEY: Watch out, baby!
Rudy: Ashley!
I'm bringing in the tree!
Yaah! Nick!
Mmm!
Aah!
looks like somebody's been having some fun.
Hey, sis.
happy holidays.
you bastard! Ohh!
take it easy. Don't hurt her.
right. Sorry, Monster.
so...
this is the guy you've been waiting for.
the man of your dreams.
Gabriel. What are you doing?
I read a lot about you, Nick.
Gabriel, what are you doing here?!
I read you're a man of some knowledge.
ASHLEY: Gabriel.
a man of some travels.
look, man, I'm not him.
whatever you want from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
Nick.
Ohh!
No! No!
Aah ha ha!
well, who are you now?
I'm not him, man!
I'm not... She just...
she thinks I'm Nick. I'm not him.
put him in the truck.
wait a minute. I was in the joint with him.
that's how I knew about him and her.
I took his place.
Gabriel: You what?
I...
OK. I got out. Nick didn't.
I knew about her letters, and...
Rudy: Jesus Christ, man, whatever you want from Nick,
I-I'm not him, OK?
I just... I wanted to be.
you're not Nick Cassidy?
no, man, I just shared his cell.
but you were saying you were?
Yeah.
so you could get with my sister?
Yeah.
so you could get down her chimney?
Yeah.
and you think telling me that's gonna help your cause?
No!
no.
no.
is this him?
please don't hurt him, Gabriel! Don't!
is this the fucker you've been writing all year?
don't, please don't.
is this Nick Cassidy?!
Yes! Yes!
Yes.
well, he better learns to give you some respect.
No!
get her out of here.
no. No.
No!
No!
man, they got a shitload of cookies.
take them.
what about the tree?
Merlin: You want the tree?
Yeah.
Uhh.
I read your letters, convict.
don't play no reindeer games with me.
ASHLEY: He read your letters.
one day, I wasn't... I wasn't there, and he... he came in, and Jane-Janey tried to stop him, but he read your letters.
what letters?
he knows you worked at that casino.
shoo.
What?!
Oh, my God, you set him up!
no. No, I didn't. I didn't.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash?
huh? After which one of his letters?
what, the 40th? The 50th?
the first? What?!
ASHLEY: No, Nick...
look, I'm not Nick!
OK?!
you thought you'd fuck him over?!
Aw, shit! Guess what? He fucked you!
because I never worked in any casino, and I can't help you, because I'm not him!
no, you don't understand! I love you!
Aw, Jesus Christ!
Hey, hey, hey, man!
watch your mouth. It's Christmas.
listen to me. Listen to me.
my brother has killed people.
I know this.
you don't know him.
you don't know what he's capable of.
he will kill you. If you keep telling him that you're not you, he will kill you.
says here the retail industry does 50% of its business between December 1st and December 25th.
that's half a year's business in one month's time.
it seems to me an intelligent country would legislate a second such gift-giving holiday.
create, say, a Christmas II, late May or early June, to further stimulate growth.
ever since you been going to night school, you've been giving me headaches, Jumpy.
Christmas II.
just...
my sweet, sexy Ashy-Lashy." Huh.
I have been dreaming of you constantly, "and knowing you are out there "makes these walls not seem so close "or so strong or so cold.
Gabriel: "Saah... someday I'm gonna take you up "by Lake Superior.
before I went in, before goddamn Millie, "I used to work up at this casino,
Gabriel: "working security.
used to watch for people stealing chips, "counting cards, getting piss-drunk, "that kind of stuff.
indian place.
easiest job I ever had.
you're a good writer, Nick.
Gabriel: I give this writing...
an A-plus.
now, you just tell us what we need to know, and you two kids, you get to go live happily ever after.
you... You give me little nieces and nephews.
listen to me, man.
I never worked at a casino.
no, Nick.
now, just shut up.
that guy who wrote that letter?
that's Nick Cassidy.
I was in the joint with him.
he rode a 2-year manslaughter bit for killing some guy who was bothering his girlfriend in a bar.
Rudy: He's dead.
he wrote those letters.
he worked at a casino.
me? My last job was at a quick booth.
I did 5 for lifting cars.
that's it, he was my cellmate.
that's how I know him.
I'm not him.
I'm sorry about your sister.
Rudy: I just got out of the joint.
I... I just wanted... I don't know anything,
I don't remember anybody, I just wanna go home.
bury this guy.
no. Gabriel, no.
ASHLEY: Gabriel, you promised.
Gabriel: I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone. When he helped us.
this guy doesn't wanna play!
ASHLEY: No, you promised me.
and you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
Gabriel: He'd rather die than be with you.
he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.
bury this guy all over the place.
no. No!
Gabriel: Come on.
Gabriel, no!
shut up!
Uhh!
now, don't get no blood on my shoes.
all right, all right, all right, all right!
what do you wanna know?!
Rudy: About the casino! About the Tomahawk!
Jesus Christ, what do you wanna know?!
spent 6 months writing love letters.
my pen pal fucks me over.
thanks for the stamps, Ash.
all right, what do you want to know?
everything.
Nick, I love you, baby.
Nick, I love you.
Gabriel: Hey.
she said she loves you.
say something.
I had better sex in prison.
throw him back in the rig.
monster, he's not the guy.
whole time you were driving, up front, he was telling her he's not the guy,
Pug: he's not the guy.
now, I understand why he'd tell us he's not the guy, but why would he tell her that he's not the guy?
maybe... Maybe he's not the guy.
look, man, if I went in the joint with a library card,
I'd come out with a library card.
the man who wrote those letters loved Ashley, boys.
he lived for her.
Where's she works?
what?
wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she?
Where's she works?
Lindstrom's, beauty and fragrances.
what's her middle name?
uh... Samantha.
What'd they call her in high school?
Bam-Bam.
What'd they call her in college?
what college?
what's her greatest fear?
brother.
Ooh, oh.
wrong. It's drowning.
wrong. It's her brother.
that's love?
it's time to start talking...
Nick.
time to start telling tales.
get him up here.
no. No! No! Fuck that!
Nick doesn't do anything until Nick gets something for Nick.
got it?
I want some hot chocolate.
you want to hear about some job of mine,
I want to see some goddamn hot chocolate.
and some pecan fuckin' pie!
Mmm. Sure nice pie.
[Joy To The World Playing On Radio]
so, when you worked there...
Mmm.
you knew the place...
OK.
you know what?
I could really go for some onion rings.
you said talk! That's all you said.
Gabriel, you said you wanted to talk...
shut up!
you just said you wanted to talk to him.
Gabriel: You can't choose your family, Ash.
unlike friends and lovers, that does relieve you of the burden of worrying you chose wrong.
how much money is in that casino?
hard to say.
well, take a guess.
5 million?
Jesus.
you, uh, you wrote Ash a letter with a story about working Christmas eve.
about how they send half the security guys home.
nobody's coming in and out, and the rest of you are getting shit-faced.
is that a true story or not?
uh, Christmas eve.
we're taking down that casino, convict.
and you're the guy that's gonna tell us how.
that's what we can see.
now, you tell us what we can't see.
where the private doors go, where the alarms are, what the upstairs looks like... all of it.
it's not the Tomahawk.
what the hell are you talking about?
what's this, the cage?
I mean, the cage is over here.
you got... This whole thing's mixed up.
that's what it looks like, Romeo.
since when?
Rudy: I mean, where... What's this?
that's the prime rib buffet.
buffet? Buffet is over here by the bar.
Rudy: I mean, what...
this map looks like it was made by a bunch of retards.
it's all wrong.
stop it.
it's my map, you little shit!
Ohh.
now, we cased the place. We saw it.
Yeah, and I worked there, for a year.
the map is kinda messy, Monster.
they must have remodeled the place.
what?
Rudy: The big guy, the boss, the guy who ran the place, uh, was in charge.
Jack Bangs.
Jack Bangs. He was always talking about giving the place a makeover.
they must have gone ahead and done that while I was in the Mountain.
Rudy: I mean, this thing's all changed around.
I can't help you with this.
I don't know where security or anything is.
I have no idea.
look, look, I don't care about the pancake breakfast.
I want...
look, you want to know about money, right?
OK, where you got the buffet down here, that used to be Bangs' office.
and he kept the safe in there.
and that safe had all the money that he was skimming in there.
and it was called the Powwow Safe.
powwow Safe?
Rudy: Yes. Powwow Safe.
cause he was stealing money from the tribe.
the guy had thousands in there.
millions, probably.
millions?
in the Powwow Safe?
millions.
but, uh, I mean, you know...
you know, now you're telling me his office is moved.
I mean, God knows what else is different.
you know, the security, the... the...
Rudy: You know, you want me to show you what goes where. I have no idea!
well...
I guess we don't need you then.
well... not necessarily.
because, if you get me inside, then I know where the money moves.
I know the security routines.
I know their signals to each other.
Rudy: I know how they operate.
you get me in there, then I can work with this map.
then I can tell you if anything's changed.
wrong, convict.
you walk in there, they recognize you.
so what?
if they recognize him, they'll remember him when the job goes down.
they won't recognize me. Trust me.
why not?
cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
Rudy: Look, I give you the wrong information, you shoot me, right?
I mean, it's pretty simple.
now, you got 2 choices...
you can either get me in there,
I can take a look around and case the joint, check out security, and I can tell you if I can work with this map or you can just shoot me right now.
Rudy: Wait a minute. Whoa, what's this?
what happened to working together?
would you rather be back in the Mountain?
I might as well be.
don't get 50 channels in the Mountain.
tomorrow, you got singing for your supper to do.
man On TV: Christmases like these.
I've always looked on Christmas as a good time.
help yourself.
man On TV: Kind, charitable.
sure. Take that. I don't need it.
TV: It's the only time when people open their hearts freely, the only time when men and women seem to realize that all human beings are really members of the same family.
Nick.
Nick...
let me help you.
get your own room, Ashley.
ASHLEY: Let me help you.
get your own room!
he said when you come out he wants to talk to you. That's all.
I thought he meant after New Year's, you know?
Oh, yeah, but you knew what he wanted, right?
I thought we had a few more days.
for what?
what are you going to do? Talk me into helping?
what, did he promise you some of the money? - No.
well, shit, you should've at least gotten that.
get your own fucking room.
Christ, you know how I hate him.
you know how I feel about my brother.
how fucking stupid are you? Huh?
what did you think was going to happen?
this thing's going to be over, and he's just going to let me go?
he's going to shoot me in the back of the head like this.
or I'm back in prison for the rest of my life, and that's it for me.
this is my life, too, you know.
this is not just about you.
you think he's just going to let me walk?
you... You think he's not going to take this out on me, Nick?
I am in this, too, and I am really scared.
please.
Ohh.
Nick.
Nick...
do you remember all those letters you wrote me about me and you against the whole world?
we can still have that.
we can have it all if you just...
if you just give him what he wants.
why do you have to keep fighting him?
why can't you just give him what he wants?
Why?
Why?
God.
you know...
it's just my luck.
I finally meet a boy that I'm crazy about, and my brother wants him worse than I do.
what do you want from me? Sympathy?
Rudy: I don't feel bad for you.
why didn't you tell me your brother was a criminal?
Gabriel knows some guys in Miami and New York...
guys that he helps get guns to Detroit.
ASHLEY: That's it. That's all I know.
and that's who he's working for on this one?
no.
he doesn't want to work for anyone.
well, what's the last place they took down?
what?
monster and his merry men...
what's the last place they robbed?
who they ripped off. What did they do?
I don't think they've robbed anywhere before.
they just... They drive guns.
they've never done a robbery?
Really?
Nick.
we can get out of this. No...
there's no "we," Ashley, OK?
Hey!
get... Get your own room.
go! Leave!
fine...
but if I told you what he wanted, you would've been gone.
you would've gotten on that bus, and you would've stayed on it.
and if that makes me selfish, then I am selfish.
ASHLEY: If that makes me a liar...
God... I am a liar.
but I have been dealing with my fucked-up brother and his fucked-up friends for way too long.
and I am stronger than him now...
because he showed up for money...
and I showed up for love.
sing it to somebody who gives a shit.
you're so quick to make me your enemy?
then tell me something, Nick.
tell me...
what did you show up for?
what did you really want?
with me?
Pug: No. Miss, miss, miss, miss.
Oh, man.
well, well, you still got the touch, Monster.
Whoa!
look what Santa's dwarves have brought you.
hmm. What do you say to Santa's dwarves?
it's elves, bro.
you say, "Thank you.

Nick, you know, you're making it really hard to apologize.
is that what you're trying to do?
say it with car keys.
Nick, a lot of relationships start out like this, you know... family problems?
save it, Bam-Bam.
hey...
I think I liked you better when you were in prison.
yeah? Is that why you keep trying to put me back in?
well, I just...
I just think you were a hell of a lot more understanding.
well, I was a different person then.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

are you with me here, boys?
snow.
now, I'm talking big-time, grade-A,
God-quality,
S-N-O-fucking-W snow.
now, look...
you guys hired me because you wanted Las Vegas quality.
I brought it to you.
you wanted Las Vegas press.
I gave that to you.
but I cannot give you Las Vegas profits until you people get together around a campfire, smoke a pipe, and do some kind of fucking spirit dance about this goddamn snow.
we understand the Paiute's casino saw a profit of $12 million last year.
don't talk to me about the Paiutes, OK?
I have it on very good authority they're cooking the books.
the Wyatolla Reservation made 17 million.
all right, look...
keep this under your feathers, boys, but it just so happens that next week,
I'm bringing in a great lounge act.
3 Russian broads.
they all look like Meryl Streep.
they can juggle anything...
your house, your car, your mother-in-law.
Mr. Bangs.
we're doing the right thing here...
Mr. Bangs, the tribe is concerned that many of your new ideas are not bringing in any new revenues.
I'm putting liquor into drinks.
I'm paying 10 times odds on craps, and I got the girls showing 16% more skin.
and by the way, you show me another buffet that offers both Coke and Pepsi.
don't even bother looking, because it doesn't exist.
OK, so, now, what else do you people want me to do?
so, does it look remodeled a lot?
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
they did a lot of work. This restaurant here is the main expansion, and they moved the games around.
the big guy's office...
they did a hell of a job with that.
hell of a job.
do you know that guy?
Yeah. That's, uh...
Ahem. That's Mike.
Mike. Yeah.
he works here.
spend some of your brother's money.
I'm going to go look around.
I was just thinking maybe you fellas would like to stick around...
you know, try the 5. 99 prime rib.
thank you.
couple of rum and Cokes, please.
you want that rum and Coke or rum and Pepsi?
woman: Did you keep going?
Bangs: Bear.
bear, give me a bottle of any goddamn thing you got.
come on, hurry up.
jeez, rolling 2-dollar fucking bettors.
I can't go back to Vegas, Bear.
I can't go back. They'll kill me.
what does the tribe want?
what do they want?
they want their roads paved with gold is what they want.
talking to me about the fucking Paiutes.
the Paiutes are on the interstate, OK?
Bangs: There's nothing I can do about that, my friend.
and I certainly didn't pick this spot for your reservation.
neither did we.
Yeah, yeah.
thanks a lot.
Hey, how you doing, cowboy? How are you?
good. Great.
Jack Bangs is the name.
Hey, listen. Listen, now, you look like an intelligent fellow.
let me ask you something.
Bangs: Do you think that Upstate Michigan needs another roadside casino, or...
do you think that Upstate Michigan needs an international gaming destination?
Bangs: What do you think?
roadside casino.
how'd you hear about us?
radio, TV, cable?
prison.
prison.
dealer: Place your bets, please.
I can't go back to Vegas.
Oh, God!
we won! We won!
Oh, fuck.
what the hell was that all about?
nothing, man. He just wanted to know how I, you know, heard about the place.
just fucking turn it down a little bit, all right?
ease up off me.
you're welcome.
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ.
I'm sorry. Here, hold this.
what are you doing?
you know what? Security's not all that changed.
let me just go clean this up, all right?
just... Just...
what was that?
his face fell off. Take this.
woman: Come on.
Hey, baby.
give me one of those.
how are you?
fucking freezing.
how long you work here?
5 years... since it opened.
how long since your makeover?
my what?
I'm taking about the place...
the remodeling, moving everything around.
Tomahawk's been the same ever since I started, buddy.
it's the losers that change.
lying motherfucker!
Uhh!
go, kid, go!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Hey.
shit.
come here!
Oh, man, it's your jacket. You can have it.
he gave me a hundred bucks. - Shit!
what the hell happened, man?
the man fucked up!
this building is the same from day one!
it hasn't been changed!
monster, he was talking to the manager inside there!
Merlin: There he is!
go, go, go, go!
come on!
get him back!
come on.
Merlin: Keep on running, Romeo!
keep on running!
as fast as you go,
Merlin: we'll get there!
we're truckers, motherfucker!
we drive for a living!
help! Help!
help!
he thinks he's getting away.
Aah! - Ooh!
Oh, shit.
Ohh!
Unh! - Ohh!
ASHLEY: No!
Gabriel: Aah!
Ahh.
Uhh!
Rudy: Come on. Come on.
Rudy: We got to get to those trees.
Ohh!
Oh, shit!
come on!
Gabriel: Get them out of there!
come on! Get him out!
is she all right?
all right! All right, all right!
all right!
at the rate you're going,
I'm going to have trouble considering you family.
man: Hey! Hey, there!
you folks need some help?
Hey, I say, you need some help?
get out of here, man!
shut the fuck up!
look, man, get the fuck out of here!
well...
if you need some help...
ASHLEY: Gabriel, no!
Rudy: Gabriel, he won't hurt us!
Gabriel, he won't remember us! Don't do it!
shut the fuck up!
Rudy: No! Stop!
Oh, God!
ASHLEY: No!
Jesus... please.
I'm just a farmer.
I got a wife and family.
I got a hunger...
and a headache.
Hey, Monster.
boy: Here they are! Come on!
get out of here.
get out of here.
Nick the Trick.
the master of disguise.
I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
what? Yeah.
never tried.
well...
in the spirit of the season, convict...
I'm going to give you a chance.
I understand you're unhappy.
it's been kind of rough.
you need a little guidance.
you're like a wanderer who's just lost his way in the night.
so we're going to have a little contest.
we're each going to get one of these.
whichever one hits closest to the bull's-eye gets what he wants.
you land closer, you get Ashley.
you kids get to go free.
I land closer...
then we start getting your help.
hmm.
may the man who really wants it win.
yeah?
Oh.
shit.
you got something to say to me, Nick?
2 out of 3?
Aah!
Ohh.
what's this? What's this?
this... This isn't the Tomahawk.
no, no. I've never seen this before.
they must've given the place a makeover.
Gabriel: Yeah. The buffet was over here.
the blackjack was over here.
the bar used to be over here.
I don't know. I can't help you.
I have no idea. I have no idea.
something tells me you're not being totally honest with me.
What'd you tell that casino manager?
nothing that matters. Nothing.
you were talking to him. What'd you tell him?
nothing.
he thought I was some gambler.
nothing.
maybe something about a robbery?
no, man. I swear... I swear to God.
Aah!
Jesus Christ, man, he thought I was some gambler.
he didn't know me, man!
he didn't recognize me! Jesus Christ!
I've been driving rigs a long time, convict.
Gabriel: Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on unless I was driving 15 hours a day.
tell them I was tired, shit, they'd just hire someone else.
Gabriel: A thousand miles by sundown, or the gang don't eat come sunrise.
shit.
and every road, every mile, it's nothing but moms and pops
Gabriel: and car-seat kiddies giving me that look to go to hell and get off their happy goddamn highway.
Ohh. Ohh, ohh.
so...
so I have worked and I have slaved and I have waited for the highways to split open and for the rivers to roil and for God in the heavens to reach down and show me some sign of my reward...
to grant me with my gift and say to me, "Gabriel, my son, you are done with the road.
well, convict...
that gift was granted.
look, man, I swear to God.
he just wanted to know how I heard about the place, that's all.
he didn't know it was me, Gabriel.
Gabriel, he didn't know it was me.
Rudy: Please.
man, Monster, just don't start trying to hit me.
Nick...
I've been trying to hit you.
Aah!
Aah! Uhh!
Uhh!
because I do not deserve to be in some shit-bag motel in the middle of bum-fuck Michigan throwing darts at a worthless...
Aah!
fucking convict!
Aah!
Ahh! Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh. Ahh.
Ahh.
Uhh.
you know... You know something?
my little sister...
Gabriel: she deserves a world better than you.
tonight, we're going to take one more look at that map.
and this time, you better have something worth saying.
Rudy: Ahh.
Ahh. Uhh.
Oh, my God.
Ahh! Uhh!
ASHLEY: Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
what did you do to him?
Hey!
what did they do to you, Nick?
Aah! - Jesus Christ.
what the fuck did you do to him?
bastard. Get out!
get out!
just get out.
Oh, my God.
Nick, are you all right?
hmm.
let me see.
let me see.
Aah!
Oh, God.
come here.
come here.
had some...
p-points to make.
shh, baby.
we're going to get you out of these wet clothes.
OK?
Uhh. - Oh, God.
Aah!
Oh, God.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
come here.
come here.
Rudy: Jesus.
there you go. OK.
Ohh. Ohh.
all I wanted to do was to make it back to Sidnaw, just have some of Mama's gravy, you know, and some of Aunt Lisbeth's cranberry cakes.
she makes them with... with real cranberries.
it's really good.
Uhh. Uhh.
we'll get there, baby.
Jesus. - We'll get there.
Shh.
just rest.
OK?
Uhh.
you saved my life, Nick.
huh?
you could've run, but you didn't.
you saved me.
you saved me.
I saved you because I love you, Nick.
why did you save me?
be...
the guy I was in with,
Rudy the car thief...
sometimes I read him your letters.
I mean, I know they were private, but...
you know...
he'd...
I'd read them to him, and he'd...
get this look on his face.
I swear,
I think he imagined you were writing to him.
and I know sometimes,
I think he...
he fell in love with you, too.
you gave a couple of guys hope, Ashley.
Oh, it was a good thing.
we're going to get out of this...
together, I promise you.
I promise you.
ash?
we're going to need one.
ASHLEY: What?
a gun.
we got to find a way to get me a gun.
what?
and I'll need to be inside the casino when it happens.
I can't just be outside drawing some map.
Nick, what are you talking about?
we need to find a way to make me a part of this.
a part of what?
a part of them?
look, Ash, if we're helping them with the robbery, we got to be doing more than walking away like that's winning, like that's some kind of Christmas fucking bonus.
you mean take the money?
Yeah. Take the money.
look, you want him out of your life for good?
Rudy: Want a real new year to look forward to?
if we're going to do this, then we ought to do it.
it's Christmas, Ash.
I think we deserve a present.
start singing, Nick.
# I have no gifts to bring #
# A gift to give... #
you want it? Let's go!
Merlin: Yeah. You want to keep playing, huh?
come on, let's get it on!
let me go! - Calm down.
Merlin: You want to keep playing?
I got a toy for you.
Merlin: Let me get my toy.
Yes. Let's play!
Hey, man. Hey. - Merlin: Shut up!
now you get your pussy ass over here and do what the fuck you're told!
now when you're spoke to, you listen and answer.
it was a joke, anyways.
uh, ahem. All right.
what you want to do, um...
is get to the top level up here.
Rudy: OK? And you do that through this door on the western wall.
um...
when you...
you want to get to the security, and then from the security, you get down into the cashier cage, and then you go into the count room.
now, there'll be a guard in there, but he doesn't have a gun.
Rudy: Uh, the door's accessed by a keypad.
the cashier will know the code.
what about the Powwow Safe?
that's upstairs.
you'll want to get to that.
we're going to get to the Powwow Safe.
that's good. We're going to get there.
Rudy: What you want to do is, you got to get a guy in the cage and a guy on the floor
Rudy: and somebody up top.
then you need a sweeper on the side, a lookout out front, and somebody watching the back.
so, that's... how many? That's 6.
we got 5, keeping Ashley outside.
and you need 6.
no.
look, man, I'm not making this shit up.
you know? You go in there with 5 guys, you're going to either leave an exit unguarded or an alarm unguarded.
no.
I know what I'm talking about. You...
raise your hand if you've ever done a robbery before.
Rudy: Anyone? Anyone?
whoever has done a robbery raise your hand. OK.
I have.
you need 6, Gabriel.
ASHLEY: You do.
what are you going to do about it?
Gabriel: All right.
I want a drawing of that security level...
every door, every guard, every ashtray.
Yeah. All right.
so, 6 guys... that's 6 guns.
no way.
well, what am I going to do?
I'm no threat without a gun.
no, you're not.
what's the matter, Gabriel?
huh?
isn't this what you wanted him for?
ASHLEY: Areas of expertise?
no guns.
well, you know, fine. It's up to you.
but what you got to figure out, then, is how you're going to get up to that security level without anybody knowing anything's wrong.
I can tell you right now going in there with AKs and ski masks
Rudy: Ain't going to do that.
well, that part, Nick, was planned out the day I read your letters.
Oh, yeah? What?
we're all going to dress up like cowboys?
Gabriel: No, no, not cowboys, Nick.
not on Christmas eve.
you got to be kidding me.
tis the season, convict.
ho...
ho ho.
TV: Coming up at 11: 00
on the Channel 5 News, these top stories. The search intensified...
here's your Picasso.
reported missing this morning on the Powahatchee Lake. Investigators suspect foul play.
it better be.
also, lottery fever...
Uhh!
Ahh.
Uhh.
man: How long you guys been going out?
let's get ourselves some free drinks.
Aw, yeah. I could use one.
shit.
only guy in the gun club who doesn't keep a gun in his truck.
Rudy: Shit.
Merlin: Fucker decided to build him a silicone tongue so that the boy could talk.
now, you ever see a motherfucker with a breast-implanted tongue?
Pug: Man, this guy I'm talking about, black lung was the least of his problems, man.
he had so much smoke coming out of his skin people would say, "Hey, where's the barbecue?
Yeah.
ASHLEY: No! No!
no. Get away from me, goddamn it.
get off me! Just get off me.
you heard what I said.
stay away!
no. You stay away from me.
stay the hell away from me.
you want me to scream? I'll fucking scream.
I swear to God.
Gabriel: He was trying to stop me.
you just about killed me.
Gabriel: I wasn't shooting at you.
I was just trying to stop him, put him down, shoot him in the fucking knees.
I'm a good shot. I wasn't going to kill him.
Yeah. You're such a goddamn good shot that who went through the goddamn ice, huh? Who?
Hey, I didn't put you on that ice.
you would never have been there...
I just about goddamned died, Gabriel.
Gabriel: Baby, I know that.
when I saw you fall,
I could've put the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger then.
I know you have to be with him...
but it is killing me.
Gabriel, we just have to keep doing this and...
I'm going to cut out his heart.
Gabriel: Is he ready for that?
he's helped us do the map.
he's done what we need.
we don't need him anymore.
I don't trust the little fucker.
we can do this without him.
I'm going to kill that motherfucker tonight.
no.
Jesus.
you drive me crazy, you know that?
hey...
ASHLEY: No. You listen to me, because we have to be smart about this.
the more he wants me, the more his help's for real.
ASHLEY: He's manpower.
that's all he is.
he's just more manpower.
Gabriel, he wants to help now.
he wants to Rob it.
ASHLEY: He wants to rob you.
he wants the money?
no, baby.
he wants me.
your little sister.
if only Ma and Pop...
could see us now.
Gabriel: Hey...
if only this guy would play the game by the numbers.
well, from where I stand, the only thing he's been doing right so far is fucking my girlfriend.
I don't want you with him.
when I'm with him,
I'm wanting you.
ASHLEY: All those letters to all those goddamn cons are finally going to pay off.
ASHLEY: So don't get crazy, OK?
because it's working.
Uhh!
he's our money man.
we finally found one, didn't we?
Yeah.
ASHLEY: Oh, baby.
see ya later, assholes.
Pug: Who's Jumpy calling?
Merlin: Ex-wife, probably.
which one? All the ex-wives he's got, he's probably going to have to take down 3 casinos.
you track down Gabriel?
Nah. He's with his girlfriend, making up for lost Nicky time.
Pug: Come on. Hey, let's go get a drink.
Merlin: I should go and check on Romeo.
go smile on the motherfucker in love.
shit.
you know what? I'll meet you in the bar.
Aw, fuck.
hmm.
come on, give me something.
if I can fucking hot-wire cars,
I should fucking hot-wire a hotel door.
Yeah, there we go.
damn.
who's slamming doors?
how you doing?
shit.
Ahh.
damn.
ASHLEY: Hey.
Nick.
where should we go?
huh, baby?
when we're gone from here, when we can do anything, where should we go?
I don't know about you. I'm going home.
we go together, remember?
wherever.
well, I'm going home.
tomorrow's Christmas eve, my love.
my love.
my love.
tomorrow's Christmas eve.
and your charges, sir.
happy holidays.
Ohh!
ho ho!
that's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.
Uhh!
that's for the 200 you took out of the minibar.
that's enough.
it was on my credit card!
I figured since you guys were paying for the room...
so...
you wanted a weapon, convict?
Aah! No! Don't!
well, now, look at what Santa's dwarves have brought you.
Merlin: What do you say to Santa's dwarves?
it's elves... Santa's elves.
you say, "Thank you," motherfucker.
Rudy: You hang around with criminals, you end up making a lot of plans.
but all the jobs I ever pulled, all the cars I ever stole, no plan ever went down the way it had been drawn up.
my plans to escape never worked, and being on parole, going to the police wasn't an option.
what's the matter?
you nervous?
right now, you're just a truck driver.
you haven't done anything wrong yet.
if you do this, you're going to spend the rest of your life wishing you hadn't.
Pug: Thanks for the reminder, Nick.
relax.
have a drink.
ain't that your thing?
Pug: Hey, hey! Thirsty!
this diversion you're doing...
you'd better do it just the way Monster planned, or there ain't going to be no more rest of your life.
and all through the house, not a creature was stirring.
why don't you send most of your boys home, Ed?
Tom, why don't you go spend Christmas with your family?
Ed: Don, you can shove off.
merry Christmas, Jack.
man On TV: Good to see you again.
girl On TV: Nice to see you.
nobody even comes here to cheat.
Rudy: Ho ho ho!
Hello!
eggnog for everyone. Santa's here.
good to see you. Merry Christmas.
merry Christmas.
and we'd like some money, please.
we're here to win money.
do you have any money?

very good, Captain, except that we're out of work.
seasons greetings.

Hey, sweetheart, how you doing?
I'm fucking freezing. What can I get you?

Yeah. I'm going to win your sled.
Heh heh heh!

watch out for this guy. He's a fucking jinx.
OK, Santa number 3, what can I get you?

watch my bank.
all right.
no way. Pop, you're...
goddamn it, you're hitting from my card. No.
you don't even know what it is.
he doesn't hit.
why don't you go find a chimney somewhere and fall in, huh?
Rudy: Son of a bitch!
you are killing me here.
that's the way it goes. Ha!
Ed: There's 2 more coming.
Bangs: There you go.
that's what I like to see.
now, that's the spirit.
Jack, is there a union for department store Santas?
Hey, who the fuck knows?
then go get another table! For old people!
you're old! You're taking Santa's money!
there is no other table.
Oh, bullshit!
Rudy: What kind of a people cheat Santa Claus?
waitress: What the hell are you doing?
security!
Hey! - Rudy: You took it!
you're... You're cheating me!
officer: Hey, pal! Come here, buddy!
lay down, Pop. It's all right.
come on! - Stay down.
Santa Claus is kicking the shit out of your guards.
the security room...
right at the top of the stairs. Right, right.
take a right. Security room. He...

that fucking convict. Jeez!
turn off the fucking alarm!
what the heck?

Merlin: Drop 'em!
Aah!

put the guns down! Put 'em down!
Ahh!
Christ!

Aah!
Ahh!
I don't like you!

cuff 'em.
cuff 'em! Come on!
Oh, no.
Oh, no, listen, no.
no. Please don't do this here, OK?
please... Please don't do this to me, all right?
listen.
Bangs: Look, let me tell you something.
this... This is not the...
this is just not another card club, all right?
this is the Tomahawk Casino.
we're an international gaming destination.
we're in guidebooks.
show's over.
move, goddamn you!
these guys aren't fucking around. Let's move.
get in there.
go ahead. Just... Just do what my friends say.
they're a little bit...
disturbed.
Pug: What's the security code for the count room!
code? What code? Just use the key!
Nick said code!
who the fuck is Nick?!
Oh.
Ahh!
Aah!
drop your guns!
throw your guns down! Show your hands!
drop that gun!
all right, all right, all right, all right!
drop it now!
you motherfucker!
no guns in the count room!
Merlin: Fuck you!
put 'em up in the air!
fuck you!
shit!
Merlin: No guns in the count room!
forget about him and get the money!
ASHLEY: Forget about him and get the fucking money!
forget about him.
there's no future for people like you and me, Nick.
ha ha! The places we come from...
bland towns, mill towns, small lives.
no future, just more of the same.
if you want a future, you got to stand up and steal it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
the Powwow Safe!
I want the Powwow Safe! Where is it?
I can't... I can't move back to Las Vegas.
I do not give a shit about Vegas!
the money is in the car.
let's get out of here right now.
he won't tell us where it is.
ASHLEY: What? - Gabriel: The Powwow Safe.
remember Nick Cassidy?
a security guard named Nick Cassidy?
Yeah, Nick Cassidy.
where is he?
Gabriel, we have enough money.
let's get the fuck out of here.
where is he?
not Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy worked for me 2 years ago.
cowboy.
hop along.
that's the story of your life, Ash.
you fucked the wrong guy.
Rudy Duncan, honey.
we still gonna spend Christmas together?
you fucking bastard!
Hey, hey, hey.
No! Goddamn it!
you are lucky, convict.
you're going to be spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself.
wait a minute, wait a minute.
there is a Powwow Safe, all right?
there is a Powwow Safe.
I did time with Nick Cassidy, right?
Rudy: Some shit, he told me.
some shit, I remember.
he told me the manager keeps a secret stash in his office...
a Powwow Safe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. - No! There is no safe!
he's stalling us! There's no safe!
Rudy: I overheard it. There is a Powwow Safe.
ASHLEY: He's been stalling us from day one.
there's no safe. - There's a Powwow Safe.
Rudy: I heard him.
then where the fuck is it?
behind the liquor cabinet.
Oh, Jesus.
Hey, hey.
get up. - Please.
get up. Open it.
I can't go back to Vegas.
I don't give a fuck about that!
get up! Open it!
hurry up!
Bangs: Oh, God. I can't go back.
Pow...
Wow.
powwow.
jumpy: Aah!
Ohh!
Hey, Santa Claus!
welcome to the Tomahawk!
Rudy: Oh, shit.
Yes!
Uhh!
No!
Uhh!
get up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
God is good.
Merlin: Now...
what do you say...
to Santa's dwarves?
hmm?
you say, "Thank you.
Merlin: Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Merlin: Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Uhh!
never make the same mistake twice.
you just did.
the wrong guy.
we took the place down with the wrong guy.
is this Christmas, huh?
Gabriel: Is this Christmas?
God bless us, everyone.
Gabriel: Come on. Unh!
Uhh!
smart, aren't you?
so smart. You're smarter than everybody, huh?
powwow Safe.
a little gift for us in the Powwow Safe, huh?
well, I got a gift for you from Pug and Merlin and Jumpy, you son of a bitch.
you're going where they went.
and they're going to find you there, and they're going to kick your fucking ass!
you feel smart? Huh? You think you're lucky?
well, let's see how lucky you are!
come on!
here's how lucky you are.
you got out of the Tomahawk, into your car, made it halfway to Canada until you caught some ice on the road.
get down there!
take a look.
by the time you hit the bottom down there, the whole car was burning like a comet.
must've burned up all that money, too.
was it your idea, Monster, or was it hers?
well, she told me about the convict magazines.
had to figure there'd be some guys in the pen with some useful knowledge with nobody to talk to and nobody to listen, so...
we just stocked up on stationery.
Gabriel: It's a hard life being a trucker's girl.
Oh.
baby.
come here.
I saved your life.
you shouldn't have.
he really loved you, you know that?
Rudy: Nick...
he really loved you.
who wouldn't?
Rudy: Maybe this is where you wanted him, Ashley...
some stranger at the bottom of a ravine with a burned-up heart.
maybe.
Rudy: But it didn't happen, because what you did for him, you made him the happiest he'd ever been.
shut up.
get up. Come on.
get in the car.
Hey. Hey!
Gabriel.
don't go getting all noble with me, Rudy.
guy takes a shiv for you,
ASHLEY: you go chasing his girlfriend?
don't talk to me about greed.
what? What did you say?
I said don't talk to me about greed.
no, not about that... about you said a guy takes a shiv for you.
I never said anything about a shiv.
Rudy: How'd you know there was a shiv?
you said the real Nick died saving you.
no, I didn't.
I said he died.
Rudy: I never said how.
Yes, you did. - No.
I never said how. I said he died.
you said he was stabbed.
I said he died. I never said how.
ASHLEY: You said he was stabbed, that he took a shiv...
a knife, a shank, whatever.
ash?
how'd she knew there was a shiv?
ash?
how'd she knew?
Jesus Christ.
men.
Ohh! Ahh!
Uhh.
Ohh.
merry Christmas, Rudy.
we made it, baby.
Oh, yes, we did.
we made it.
got a little messy, but...
I'll tell you all about that once we're on the road.
for your information...
I never fuck the wrong guy.
Nick: So...
Rudy...
I want you to meet Millie Bobeck.
remember Millie Bobeck, don't you?
Nick: My girlfriend, before I went in.
worked at that bar in Motor City where I man slaughtered what's-his-name.
see...
Millie here, she used to serve drinks to these gun-running truckers.
real big talkers, scheming about a real score one day.
2 years in the Mountain, man, what the hell?
why not let her get friendly with 'em?
tell 'em her real name was Ashley.
tell 'em about this idea she had, about writing guys in prison.
Millie: Find a sucker who could show them a sure thing.
Ohh.
Millie: You know...
they would've never done it without you, Nick.
tsk.
I mean, Rudy.
Nick: I always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy.
way back when I worked there.
what better way than to get some guys to rob it for me?
paid the Alamo a hundred to put the shiv in me.
Nick: He's a lifer, man, what does he care?
he was supposed to stab me in the yard later that day, but when that food fight started, man...
I couldn't believe it.
the slash across the ribs, the homemade blood capsule,
Nick: gets you a nice, warm hospital bed.
paid a guard to spread the word I bought it.
and once the wound healed up, got out of the Mountain this morning.
Nick: Tonight, I am a rich man.
get in the car.
keep your gun on him, honey.
how'd you know I'd do it?
because every time I read her letters, Rudy, you listened.
Nick: Besides, man, even if you hadn't taken the bait, we still had a shot.
she'd just have to convince them they could do it alone.
what do you know? Good old Rudy came through.
good old predictable Rudy.
Nick: Goes for the easy money, every time.
5 Santas walked into that Tomahawk, Rudy.
that's what the witnesses will say.
so, we gotta have 5 Santas not walk out.
gotta have 5.
how many things could have gone wrong?
huh? A thousand?
you think we don't know what a long shot is? Huh?
my girl Millie was steering you, man.
Nick: You fucked it up, she would've cut and run.
they'd be looking for Ashley Mercer.
whoever she is.
6 months of telling you Tomahawk stories.
guess now you know why.
you gave them the confidence to walk in there, Nick Cassidy.
Nick: That's all we needed you to do.
you said some nice things about me, man.
appreciate it.
you know what?
you're right.
I do love her.
Nick: And she...
she loves me.
you had that part right all along.
it's Christmas, sugarplum.
let's light up the tree.
Nick: Uhh.
Rudy: Shit.
shit.
Uhh! Uhh!
write me. Ha ha ha.
Aw, shit.
it's like ridin' a bike, like ridin' a bike.
good-bye, Rudy, my man.
Nick: Nice spending... time with ya!
Uhh!
rule one... never put a car thief behind the wheel!
Aah!
no.
No!
Millie: Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Uhh!
Millie: 5 Santas walked into that Tomahawk, Rudy.
that's what the witnesses will say.
so, we gotta have 5 Santas not walk out.
gotta have 5.
Nick: Rudy.
Rudy, you and me, man.
you and me.
we can split the money, huh? Hmm?
Rudy, that whore, Millie Bobeck?
did you think I was serious about her, man?
Nick: I was gonna kill her!
you gotta believe me.
you gotta believe me, I swear it.
Nick: Believe me!
believe this.
Rudy!
Rudy, help me!
Nick: Rudy!
singers: # Come, they told me #
# A newborn King to see #
# Our finest gifts we bring #
# To lay before the King #
# So to honor Him #
# When we come #
# I have no gift to bring #
# That's fit to give a king #
Rudy, voice-over: All I wanna do is make it back to Sidnaw, sit down for Christmas dinner, watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, have leftovers for about 6 months, eat some of that Christmas turkey.
like I said,
I never was much for the holidays...
until now.
I'm pregnant.
you're pregnant?
Oh, crap.
I can't believe it's over.
me, neither.
there is one way to end a relationship, and that is quickly.
you got to get it over with. Otherwise, it rots.
don't sit in a rotting relationship, Ann.
I can't believe this
23 years old, I got to move back home with daddy.
next time somebody's doing my job and they trash Trish, why don't you tell them that you're sleeping with her before they stick their foot in their mouth?
a life of an actor is full of constant rejection and a life of uncertainty.
I mean, you knew what you were getting into.
you're from Brooklyn, right?
Uh-huh, Bay Ridge.
where are you from?
Oh, I'm not prepared to tell you that.
you want me to ask him if he likes you?
Yeah.
okay.
you will?
I'll pass him a note in homeroom.
Rosie, why didn't you tell me you had a new boyfriend?
he's not my boyfriend. He's just a friend.
that's what we like to hear.
so, is it "lay" or "lie"? I always get that wrong.
it's, um...
it's "lay.
Hey, Rose.
Oh, my god. Is that Alex?
do I have time to run to the bathroom and hide?
been looking for you.
hmm, not really.
Hey, man.
hey... man.
Hi.
Oh, don't worry. I love a girl who's not afraid to fight acne in public.
Thanks.
did you read the short play I wrote for theater night?
of course I did.
Oh, my god, it was so just there.
I mean -- what I mean is your dialogue was so really... real.
succinct.
you, uh, you need a comma after "succinct.
and that is all the genius I can give you.
Organic-chemistry homework calls.
later, guys.
Bye.
so, has anybody cast your other piece yet?
Oh, I wouldn't expect anyone to. I'm just a first year.
don't sell yourself short. You're making an impression.
I don't know if it's the talent or the Hello Kitty socks.
um, so, who'd you cast?
well, I'm playing he.
obviously. So, who's playing she?
I'm not sure. I'm still looking.
Oh, what kind of actress are you looking for?
superhot would be good.
superhot.
basically I'm trying to figure out who's right and who's interested.
Oh, well, I'd be interested.
not that I'm saying I'm superhot, especially not right now, but I would definitely be interested.
that is, if you're interested in me being interested and if interest makes up for any lack of hotness or superhotness.
well, that's good to know.
I'll keep that in mind.
I give Bob one book on pregnancy and he's turned into the prenatal police.
P. S. -- Do not let him know I ate a hot dog on the way here.
who are you looking for? - Nobody.
Oh, my god. You're looking for Danny.
no, I'm not. - Oh!
besides, there are thousands of people here. I couldn't find him if I tried, and I am not trying.
I didn't invite you here tonight so you can obsess over Danny.
okay, sorry.
no more looking. No more obsessing.
although I don't know why he gets our James Taylor tickets.
honey, I got you better seats.
Yeah, I mean, but he could've split them with me.
but then you'd be next to him, and it'd be like a date.
shut up.
I bet he is on a date, probably with Megan.
who's Megan?
little miss hot hostess from the restaurant.
you know, the slut that seats people? Her.
or he could be with some other slut.
all the more reason not to look.
exactly.
Oh, my god. There he is.
what? Oh, my god, I thought you weren't gonna look.
I swear, if he is with Megan, I'm gonna
Oh, my god.
he's with dad.
what are you doing? - Give me this!
Hey!
that's your slut?!
Hi.
hello.
not that I'm assuming that this is you or anything, but w-why is this in the microwave?
that's kind of a long story, Bob.
the good news is I didn't burn down your apartment.
hello.
concert ended already?
no. We just, uh, decided to come home early.
is that a burnt bra? - Yes, it is.
I'm protesting. Guess what against.
did you eat a hot dog?
you're like a bomb-sniffing dog.
Hey, who wants to watch "the making of the 'House of wax'" -- Bob?
that sounds riveting.
but, no, I'm gonna read chapter four of "paternal prenatal prepared.
Oh, Bob, please don't read any more books.
if you gain any more expertise, I'm gonna need an epidural to endure you.
Oh!
all right, don't freak out. How do you get red wine out of a rug?
Ooh, Marjee, I know -- you start off by going back to Brooklyn!
okay, okay, okay.
tonight she needs to go. - Okay, okay.
I heard that, Bob.
okay. Marjee, you have to go home tonight.
Ginnie, listen to me -- you have no idea how bad it is at home, okay?
as if living with "perkoleptic" Renee wasn't bad enough, now dad's gotten into this new jag of reminding me "what a huge disappointment I am."
I didn't send you to college so you could throw parties for a living."
you better get your act together. - I'm very sorry he's not being supportive.
thank you.
now go home. - Ginnie!
look, you don't understand.
if you do not leave tonight, Bob is going to divorce me.
and I'm barely prepared to be a mom, much less a single mom.
why don't you just ask Ann if you can stay at her house?
I already did. She said no.
that's how I learned that asking in advance is a bad idea.
Oh. Out!
Ginnie, come on.
Where's that soft, maternal side I love about you?
don't get mugged on the subway.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
so, you got the part in Alex's play, huh?
Yes, I'm she. I'm she!
I'm she! I'm she! I'm she!
looking forward to working with you.
Yeah, me, too.
I'm she.
well, I brought a lot of cheese.
no, no, this is fantastic. - No such thing as too much cheese.
even though you kicked me out of your apartment, I still brough the cinnamon buns.
buns, buns!
Ooh, darling, no brie.
see, soft cheeses contain unpasteurized milk.
it's not good for the baby. - Oh, fine.
I'm gonna prepare you a nice, fresh spinach salad.
get your folic acid for the day, all right?
Hey.
what does this remind you of?
something else Bob won't let me eat.
look -- it's the leaning tower of Pisa.
Oh.
we have this client -- he's planning this anniversary party for him and his wife.
they met when they were climbing the leaning tower of Pisa, so I just had this idea -- I could make a leaning tower of Pisa cake.
look at you working on the weekends.
Hey. I brought the coffee.
sucky decaf for Ginnie.
see, daddy, look.
this is what I do.
you stack cinnamon buns.
I design cakes. Well, I mean, that's part of what I do.
that's great. You could go to culinary school and become a pastry chef.
I don't need to become a pastry chef, dad, because I already am a party planner.
what, I'm just trying to help you find a career where you can use skills like these.
I have a career, dad. How come you're never on Ginnie or Ann for what they do?
an attorney and a therapist are jobs I understand.
forget it.
I think I handled that well.
Hey, dad... about last night...
sorry I called you a slut.
Hey, I grew up around fiery italian women.
slut" is a good day for me.
it's just that last night was the first time I've seen Danny since we broke up.
and to see you there with him, I just felt like
like I was on his side instead of yours.
Yes.
but now that you say it out loud, it sounds really stupid.
no, honey, it's not stupid.
I should've thought it through better.
I'm sorry.
Hey, it was James Taylor. How could you not go?
but if he invites you to Carly Simon, please say no.
it's a deal.
what's up?
what are you doing friday night?
that depends. Are you calling me for a favor or for something fun?
I'm starring in a play. Alex cast me.
who's Alex?
Alex Brody. He wrote it and he's starring in it with me.
Oh, Alex Brody. Do I smell a boyfriend?
no. Anyway, I'm starting a phone chain.
I need you to call Ann and tell her...
rose is starring in a play with her new boyfriend, so call and tell Ginnie, but do not tell dad.
why not?
cause Rose is afraid... - Dad will be too judgmental.
Oh, but he'll so want to come.
I know. That's what I said.
he's barely on board with me being in theater as it is.
I have to make sure the first thing I invite him to is amazing.
otherwise he's going to doubt the choice I've made and force me to switch back to pre-med.
okay, we won't tell him, but...
only if you tell us whether Alex is your boyfriend.
shut up. I'll see you friday.
Hey, Ann. - Hey, Megan.
just here to see Danny.
Oh, he's in back. Do you want me to go grab him for you?
no, I can grab him myself.
slut.
Hey, Ann.
Hey.
some of your mail has been straggling through, so I thought I'd drop it off.
Oh, thanks. I put the forwarding notice in at the post office. I guess
Yeah, well, what can you do? Your mail still wants to be with me.
anyway, um... I wanted to apologize for the other night.
I was caught off guard, and I overreacted.
Yeah, I just wanted to take your dad to the concert.
I know, and he really enjoyed it and I know how much he misses spending time with you, so I'm really sorry.
excuse me, Danny? Can I borrow you for a sec?
he'll be right there.
so, uh, so we're cool?
Yeah, we're cool.
she gets on my nerves.
rose. Hey.
Oh, my god, Ann.
guys, this is my sister Ann. Ann, this is
Yeah, hi. - Hi.
what are you doing? - Having lunch.
here?
Danny gives us free sandwiches.
so what?
if this is about the money, I could give you 20 bucks.
I don't get it. What's the problem?
the problem is you don't have lunch at your sister's ex-boyfriend's restaurant.
Hey, I'm sorry. I know you guys are in the middle of a fight
and coming from a crazy family, I respect that
but I will kick myself if I don't do this.
I'm Zach.
Oh, you think this is funny?
I don't. It's just that -- - No, no, no. No, laugh it up.
it's hysterical, right?
Yeah, go eat your fricking free sandwiches.
Oh, and by the way, when you're in acting class, maybe you can learn how to act like a real sister.
I didn't mean it, Ann. I'm sorry.
nice meeting you!
so Jason will incorporate the white orchids you want for the place settings.
in the entire room. Which will give the place a magical feeling.
and we're all set.
great.
and the leaning tower of Pisa
stroke of genius, Trish.
Oh, thank you.
that's why you pay me the big bucks.
that's why you pay me the big bucks.
should I remove sharp projectile objects from your reach?
sorry. I know she's your girlfriend.
but can I not get acknowledged for one lousy leaning cake?
it's not a lousy cake, and you'll get acknowledged. Just be patient.
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
are you kidding?
it took six months before Trish gave me credit for being a good kisser.
up until then, I was just the lucky guy who happened to be in contact with her magical lips.
how do you even deal with that?
I know I'm a good kisser.
just like you know your ideas are good.
well, thank you.
but I think I'm just taking it extra hard 'cause I got to go home and deal with my dad.
your dad?
Yes, I lost my apartment, so now I got to live in Brooklyn with my dad until I find a new place to stay.
Yeah, you know how that is on the self-esteem.
well, hey, if you need a temporary place to crash, why don't you stay at my place?
what?
I've got this great one-bedroom in the village.
but I'm practically living here with Trish, so I'm never there.
I have a spare key. You want to take it?
this is the part where I'm supposed to say, "no, I couldn't possibly. That's way too much.
but, uh, yeah, those words just are not gonna come out of my mouth.
I got to get downtown to pick up some supplies and I probably won't be back for the rest of the day.
so, my apartment is at 142 Jane Street. It's number 6.
God, Jason, thank you. I-I don't even know what to say. Thank you so much.
Oh, and try not to kill Trish. 'Cause if you do, I'm gonna need my place back.
Ah, ow! What's going on?
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
wait a minute.
what am I doing on your side of the bed?
Oh, yeah, it was really weird because when I went to bed last night, you were on my side, so I had to sleep on your side.
but I never sleep on your side of the bed. I always sleep on my side of the bed.
I like to sleep on my right side, facing towards you.
Oh, my god.
what happened? What happened?
you moved me.
no. Unh-unh.
you moved me to your side of the bed so that when I turned in to face you,
I'd be sleeping on my left side.
nutrients to the placenta.
it's better for the baby.
do you know what else is better for the baby?
me not killing its father before it's born.
darling -- - No, no, no, no.
don't "darling." I can't take this anymore, Bob.
you won't even let me sleep like a normal person.
last night you wouldn't even let me take a bath.
but the book says that hot baths are bad for the baby.
I did not take a hot bath. I took a warm bath, Bob.
but, hey, while we're at it, why don't you just stick a thermometer up my ass every four minutes so that the baby doesn't overheat?!
I love you.
if I could just walk out that door.
free will.
free will won't help me.
that door won't help you.
okay, stop.
look, this totally isn't working. I'm not feeling drawn in.
I-is it me? Am I not doing it right?
no, no, no, it's not you. It's both of us.
I'm just not feeling the magnetism. Maybe we should stage it so we're closer together.
no, Alex, I like that you're at opposite ends of the stage.
then you're being drawn together despite the consequences.
but something has to connect us.
it's what's underneath the words. It has to be palpable from us to the back of the theater.
what if you take your clothes off?
very funny.
what? I'm totally serious.
and totally not helping.
wait a second. Let's think about that.
what?
maybe that's how we should do it.
I like it. We could try it.
she says "free will" and starts to undress.
it draws me to you. The pull is magnetic.
but she doesn't move.
you're kidding, right?
you want me to be totally naked?
I'm gonna be naked with you.
you're talking to a girl who used to hide behind her locker door when we had to change for gym class.
look, don't overthink it. The, uh, the nudity in this piece is symbolic, not literal.
so we're not gonna take our clothes off?
no, of course we are. That's just not what the scene is about.
that's what the scene's going to be about to my family, who's going to be in the audience, looking at m-m-m-m-my everything.
your "everything" is totally beautiful.
and if your family's freaked out by you expressing your art, that's their problem.
say the first part again?
you're beautiful, and you're talented, and you're my leading lady.
so, we're gonna take our clothes off, and we're gonna make this play great.
together.
okay.
yo, Alex.
we need you to go over the light cues.
I'll be right there.
catch you later.
okay.
check out the wet bar.
Oh, that's right -- you're not really the wet-bar type till Mr. or Ms. Sorelli-Spencer junior pops out.
how are you paying for this place?
I'm not.
that's what's so great.
it's more like a house-sitting gig.
rose? - Yeah, it's me.
all right, come up.
Ooh, who's miss strike-a-pose?
Trish as in "oh, I hate my boss" Trish?
this week, she's "I steal Marjee's ideas and pretend they're mine" Trish.
so you're house-sitting for your boss.
Mnh-mnh. It's her boyfriend's apartment.
so you're house-sitting for your boss's boyfriend?
Yeah. What? What's the -- what's the look?
Marjee, please tell me you're not sleeping with him.
w-what? No! God, why would you even say something like that?
I don't know, maybe because you constantly have a habit of getting into relationships with totally inappropriate guys.
again with the look. God, can anybody just have a little bit of faith that maybe I'm not a totally self-destructive mess?
Hey, guys. - Hello.
Wow. Who are you sleeping with to get this place?
I am not sleeping with anybody.
okay.
so, is Ann coming, or is she still mad at me?
why is Ann mad at you?
she saw me going to have lunch with some of my friends at Danny's restaurant and she got upset.
I tried to apologize, but
Oh, sweetie, Ann is not mad at you.
I'm having dinner with her tomorrow night. I'll make sure everything is okay.
how are things with the boyfriend's play?
first of all, he's not my boyfriend. And second of all, about the play, now that we've started rehearsals, I'm realizing it's kind of a work in progress.
so, I don't think you guys should come.
what?
but it's your first show ever. It's a big deal. We want to be there for you.
look, please, I'd really rather you didn't come.
but I don't
I don't think you're gonna like it.
but why? - Because.
because why? - Because there's some nudity in it.
Oh, my god. X-rad theater? We're going. We're going.
and the nudity involves me.
what do you mean, the nudity involves you?
one of the scenes in the play requires me to take my clothes off.
all of them?!
don't give me the look.
you said you were going to take your clothes off in a theater full of people.
what look would you like me to give you?
just listen -- it's a really good play, and the nudity isn't literal, it's symbolic.
and -- and if you guys have an issue with me expressing my art, well, that's your problem and not mine.
I'm just glad you didn't invite dad.
I know. You guys have to swear never to tell him.
because if he finds out, he's going to freak and make me quit the theater program.
I swear. - Swear.
yummy.
sorry.
I know you hate saltines. I know you hate me being the pregnancy patrol.
the prenatal police. - Yeah, that, as well.
and, you know, I don't want to police or patrol or "P"-word you in any way whatsoever.
but every night, darling, like clockwork you
well, you vomit 20 minutes after we've gone to bed, and I've heard that crackers really help.
so, I thought, you know, seeing as we're gonna be pregnant for a long, long time, we might as well try and have a little less upchucking.
who's having this baby, Bob?
we are.
let's do this again.
who's carrying this baby in her womb?
well, you're the one with the uterus, but
exactly -- I'm the one with the uterus.
so, if I would rather upchuck than eat saltines, so be it.
sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm
just this new-dad thing, you know,
I'm desperate to get it right.
I know, but you need -- - I need to back off at least 50%.
try 95%.
95%? Bloody hell.
Ohh.
you okay?
no, I'm not.
Bob?
Ann, is that you?
I'm coming down.
wait. Buzz me up. I have to go pee before we go.
no. Why come all the way up? I'm on my way down.
we'll hop in a cab and you can pee at the restaurant.
I can't hold it till 74th and Broadway.
I'm coming down.
Oh, hold the door.
thank you.
Oh, come on.
Ohh!
holy cow. Oh, my goodness.
Hello? Ohh!
Hello, Ann. Ginnie went down there to meet you.
I know, but my bladder's gonna burst.
uh, wait.
I can't wait.
Oh, my god.
Ann. Oh, my god.
this is why you wouldn't let me pee?
Ann, sweetie -- - Don't "Ann, sweetie" me.
I can't believe my entire family is seeing my ex-boyfriend behind my back.
wait a second. This is not Ginnie's fault. It's my fault.
I bought the college-football package, and I hate watching the games alone.
no, I'm the sister. I'm the one that should be yelled at.
no, you shouldn't.
Bob, it's okay. - It's not okay.
I'm saying it's okay. - It's not okay!
okay, stop it!
Bob's right. I shouldn't be yelling at you.
I should be yelling at you.
what?
you, me, on the terrace. Now.
don't you have to pee?
my anger absorbed it.
anger absorbs pee?
I don't know why this is such a big deal.
Bob called me to come watch the game, and I said okay. It was that innocent.
right, and the concert with my dad and the free sandwiches with Rose.
do you have any idea what it feels like to know that my family can spend time with you, but I can't?
you're right.
I'm being totally selfish. I'm sorry.
you know, I...
I remember the first time you invited me for -- for Christmas dinner...
and I looked over at the fireplace and there were no stockings, just a line of your snow boots with the names attached
an extra one at the end -- "Danny.
you have no idea how excited my dad was to finally put another male boot up there with his.
that's the first time I ever really felt a part of something.
your family, it's the only family I ever...
and your dad
I know. You're like the son he never had.
and don't ever tell Bob I said that.
I know I got to cut the cord, and I'm gonna do it. I promise.
I'm sorry if I hurt you.
that's the last thing I ever wanted to do -- ever.
Oh. Will you do me a favor?
rose invited me to her play on Friday.
could you just tell her I couldn't make it?
no.
what?
no, I can't tell her that.
Annie -- - 'Cause you should be there.
what? I-I-I thought we just -- - I know. We just
one thing that I have and you don't is family.
sometimes it's easy to forget just how much that means 'cause I never have to think about it, you know? They're always there.
but you don't have that, and I can't just take that away from you.
I don't know, Ann. - Yeah, well, I do.
and, hey, who knows?
maybe someday I'll even get used to seeing you around and you and me and all the Megans in your life will all be friends.
think we could do that?
no.
Yeah, Trish, I got the Bauer bite.
no, I did not get the nonfat chicken. They didn't have them.
I got the low-sodium liver.
okay, then I will go back tomorrow.
all right. Trish, I really got to go.
okay, all right. Goodbye.
Oh, god!
they put dogs to sleep. Why can't they put their owners to sleep?
are you okay?
God... Jason.
I didn't mean to catch you off guard.
I didn't know you were here.
sorry I didn't call ahead. It's just, I left my cellphone at Trish's.
and since she's been yelling at me all night, I decided it wasn't worth going back to get it.
how has Trish been yelling at you all night? She's been yelling at me all night.
she's the queen of multitasking.
I'm mooching your vodka. I will totally get you more. I swear.
Hey, don't sweat it.
but you better drink fast 'cause I am way ahead.
Oh, well, better put on your drinking shoes, 'cause the 100-yard vodka dash just happens to be my gold-medal event.
Uh-huh? - Uh-huh.
Cincin. - Cincin.
there you are. How was your doctor's appointment?
Oh, it was great, yeah. No worry.
well, what happened? What did he say? Why are you throwing up?
you have a stomach virus or flu?
what was it?
nothing.
well, Bob, nothing doesn't make you spend the night throwing up in the toilet.
Bob, what's going on?
all right.
I got a sympathetic pregnancy.
you have a sympathetic what?
sympathetic pregnancy.
don't even say a word, all right?
it's a real condition, actually. It's called couvade syndrome.
and, you know, lots of men get it.
lots of men develop the same symptoms as their pregnant wives
you know, weight gain, morning sickness.
it's our way of -- hmm
it's our way of taking part in the pregnancy.
you know, it's, uh, it's normal.
Dr. Tabbar says not to worry because all the symptoms will disappear when our baby is born, so...
Oh, my god.
we're pregnant.
Yeah.
I'm serious. You totally saved my ass on that one.
you totally saved my ass at the crush magazine premiere.
no way. You totally had that one under control.
please! - I threw in a few optional design ideas.
fine, then you only half-saved my ass. - Oh, so I owe you half an ass-saving.
damn straight. Don't think I won't be collecting on that.
what are you doing?
I don't know.
I can't believe Trish doesn't give you credit for being a good kisser.
what? What? No. I'm -- I'm sorry.
it's okay. - Oh, my god. No, it's not -- it's not okay.
this is why she gave me the look. - What?
Ginnie. I got to go.
no, it's my fault, really. You don't have to leave.
all right. Here's what we're gonna do -- this, it never happened, okay?
and thank you for letting me borrow your apartment. And the vodka
I will replace the vodka. I mean, not here, obviously. I'll leave it on your desk.
just someplace where it's not weird, you know, but it's easy for you to find.
God! Where are your keys?
um... on the floor?
on the floor. Okay, good, so now you have them, and I don't have them anymore.
and I will see you tomorrow, Jason, at work with Trish, with your girlfriend and my boss.
and this never happened. I know I said that already.
okay. I got to go.
and I'm sorry if your rug smells like treats or liver or whatever.
I cannot believe you kissed your boss's boyfriend.
only kissed him. I can't get credit for anything.
Hey. - Hey.
are you okay?
I'm working on it.
okay.
I can do this.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, why are dad and Renee here?
I don't know. I surely didn't invite them.
neither did I, and we know Rose sure as hell didn't.
Oh, my god. Oh my god.
rose sent me the flyer. I left it on the kitchen counter when I left this morning.
you what?
how could you leave the flyer out?!
maybe if one of my sisters would let me stay in their apartment,
I would not be kissing my boss's boyfriend and leaving flyers out at dad's house
maybe.
stop kicking yourself.
I just wish she felt comfortable enough to invite us in person.
you know, it's my fault
being so hard on her, not showing support.
the important thing is that you're here.
after the show, we'll go backstage and she'll know you're here to support her.
she'll just be so thrilled that you came.
okay.
okay, everybody, places. Don't make me say it twice. Let's go.
ready to go?
um... um... on stage or out the building?
great.
now what?
pray someone in the audience knows CPR.
what do you want me to do?
help me.
I've done everything I can.
I know, I just...
look at her.
she is a total natural up there.
Oh, if I could only walk out that door.
free will.
that's my Rose.
free will won't help me.
that door won't help you.
W-w-w-what? What's the hell's going on?
don't be upset. Remember, it's art.
it's art?! It's my daughter!
Shh!
when did her boobs get bigger than mine?
there's never been a moment of regret.
Ooh. Wow.
all right. I got to get out of here.
Joe, you said you were gonna support her.
that was before I realized my daughter was in a porno play.
excuse me, sir, but could you please sit down?
you're blocking a very important moment in my life.
Joe, no hitting!
my life.
my love.
Whoo!
ow, ow, ow!
Whoo-hoo! Nice!
did you guys really like it?
Oh, are you kidding me? You were so good.
like you were on stage a million times. You were amazing.
Hey, when did your boobs get bigger than mine?
Marjee. - No, when?
I'm sorry. I had already invited Danny and
don't worry. It's okay.
you were really great.
Thanks.
so, has anyone seen dad?
it's my fault. Rose, it's totally my fault.
I left the flyer out on the counter. I'm sorry.
just hit me, you know? Just hit me hard. I deserve it. Please.
Marjee, it's okay.
has anyone seen him?
no, honey.
I think he left.
Oh.
well, that's okay.
there she is.
that's all the Italian I know.
you were wonderful, just super.
Joe, here she is.
Hey, dad.
well, I guess I know why I wasn't invited.
dad, it's not that. It's
no. I got two things to say, and I'm gonna say 'em.
first of all, you should all thank Renee for not letting me slug the kid behind me who was ogling my youngest daughter.
and second, to be honest with you,
I came here tonight thinking, "so, I'm gonna see Rose in a little play.
but, honey, you have got something really special.
and as hard as it's gonna be for me to let go of the whole med school thing,
I think you made the right choice because you are really talented, and I am so proud of you.
Thanks, dad.
in fact, you were so good that I actually forgot you were up there in your birthday suit.
uh, do you mind if I steal the star of the show for just a minute?
Oh, my god, it's the famous Alex.
Yes, you can steal me. Please.
that was really great, dad.
you made my mascara run.
I can't believe she was naked!
what is it? Where are we going?
I just wanted to thank you, Rose.
you were incredible.
on stage, you were beautiful and magnetic and...
everything I could've asked for.
Hey. Flash said I'd find you guys back here.
um... I'm sorry.
no, no, it's okay. We were just, um
I just -- - No, no, it's okay, man.
I was just telling Rose how great she was.
and I have to go say hello to some people before they take off.
um... he was right. You were really, really great.
like, the kind of great that made me realize you definitely don't belong in organic chemistry lab.
Thanks.
anyway, um... in celebration of your first performance as a truly amazing artist,
I, uh, brought you these.
roses.
Yeah, I did a little research, and yellow stands for the promise of new beginnings, so...
Thanks.
this really means a lot to me.
do you want to go grab a bite? Celebrate?
yo, Sorelli Alex wants your mug out front for a cast picture. Don't make me say it twice.
sorry, I got to go.
no. No, no, no. It's no big deal.
actually, I have to go home and study anyway.
I have a major exam tomorrow on the reproductive cycle of fungus.
I'll try not to be jealous.
I know how tough that is.
coming.
Bye. - Bye.
thank you.
you did really great with Danny tonight.
I know. I think I'm actually gonna be okay.
Oh.
baby, there's a cab on the curb, meter running.
man!
what's wrong -- - It's nothing. It's nothing.
listen, coffee tomorrow in the park. No Bob, no baby talk.
just you and me, sucky decaf.
you, me, sucky decaf. You're on.
Hey, aren't you Rose's sister?
I introduced myself the other day on the sidewalk.
you were yelling at Rose.
Oh, my god, I am so sorry.
apology accepted... if you'll have a drink with me.
excuse me? How old are you?
old enough to have a fake I. D.
Yeah, okay. Good night, Zach.
old enough to spot an incredible woman despite the fact that she won't give me the time of day because of my age.
it won't hurt to talk to me.
Hey. I thought you left.
Yeah. I just thought I'd have a drink.
Oh, yeah, nothing like a plastic cup of $7 chardonnay.
what's up?
don't know.
just, uh...
Yeah.
you let go of a good one.
the thing is, um...
I'm not so sure I want to let go.
Yeah, well...
until you do know for sure
he's ahead of the field, blazing in. Lakers by seven!
this is Marv Albert from the Forum in LA.
and the Knicks in big trouble as they move to the front court.
going from right to left Cummings takes the one-bounce.
a flip for King. It's batted away! Magic Johnson on the steal!
he's down the left side and goes baseline! He's trapped! Throws back out.
to Worthy. A head-fake, now the jumper. It is good!
only 10 seconds left. The Lakers are burying the Knicks!
the Knicks have come back from the dead before, but not tonight!
come in, 2L-16.
respond, 2L-16.
sergeant Leary says to remind you, you owe him $50 on tonight's game.
and that he'd be happy to take your money on the Knicks anytime.
come on!
give it to him!
where is it?
give me what's mine, you understand? It's mine and I want it now!
look at this! Look what I found. This is mine, baby.
Freeze!
aII right, hands out of your pockets, away from your body.
suck wall!
get your feet back. Back! And spread them!
all right, wider! I said, wider!
you ought to be ashamed of yourseIf, picking on a guy haIf your size.
nice shot, kid! -Good shot, Joey.
hit him!
don't move.
don't even breathe.
we have come to mourn and honor not only the passing of a friend...
but of a fine police officer.
an officer who was an exampIe to us all.
samuel Edward Makin died as he lived...
defending the American way.
that is why I feel more pride than sorrow.
for SamueI Makin made the uItimate sacrifice.
he did so willingIy...
and no man can hope to do more.
his body may be returned to the earth...
but his spirit will live forever.
we, your fellow officers...
salute you, Sam.
your duty done...
may you rest in peace.
ready...
aim, fire!
I was shaving you.
where am I?
now don't worry. Everything's going to be just fine.
that's not me!
what the hell have you done to me?
we did some work on you.
just your face. Thank you, Nurse.
you'd better have had a damn good reason.
we did.
you were ugIy.
who's we?
you've been recruited by an organization that doesn't exist.
Sam Makin is dead, pal.
some nasty man shoved him and his police cruiser into the East River.
I'm a pretty healthy corpse.
the operative word is " corpse. "
you've got a new face, new fingerprints, even a new name.
Williams...
Remo Williams.
a lot of thought went into it.
we needed someone, and you were the best we could find.
decorated cop, ex-Marine, no famiIy, no commitments.
if I'm the best you can find, you're in pretty deep shit, pal.
who the hell are you, anyway? FBI? CIA? Salvation Army?
who we are, are the people who got you by the balls, Remo.
besides, we need you.
our cops are corrupt, our judges are bought, our politicians are up for sale.
everywhere you look, slime is on the loose.
you're going to be the Eleventh Commandment.
thou shalt not get away with it.
you're the guy that set me up in that warehouse, ain't you?
nice job.
the name's MacCleary. We'll get to know each other.
enjoy the fruit...
Jeez!
there you go, Mr. Mossler.
soon you're gonna be as snug as a little old bug in a rug.
where the hell are you going with my ambulance?
turn left at the next intersection...
don't get any cute ideas, Remo.
national Bank?
what, are you opening an account for me? -Let's go.
what do these things do?
keep track of your wardrobe?
I thought they figured out a way to make them smaller.
these are the smaller ones.
come in, Mr... -Williams, Remo Williams.
good evening, Mr. Williams.
I'm Harold Smith. I'm the head of the organization that just recruited you.
you call dumping me in the river and reshuffling my face recruitment?
Yep. It works. Sit down.
come on, my boy.
I know your ribs are hurting like a son of a bitch.
now sit down a minute. Make yourseIf comfortable.
I'll tell you a little bit about the way we work here.
Yeah, I've seen how you work.
you run black-bag operations, you kidnap people.
you beat them up, and nobody holds you accountable.
we're accountable, Mr. Williams.
let me guess. To the President. -Yep.
and five of them before him. I've Iost track. I don't even vote anymore.
sorry to disappoint you. I'm voting with my feet.
now you want to sit down?
I'm only going to say this once.
this is a wonderful country...
but our legal system doesn't work the way it's supposed to.
I'm talking about peopIe who roam the halls of power with impunity.
who corrupt and subvert the very principles our constitution exists to uphold.
your friend already gave me the Gettysburg Address.
has he?
here's another one.
"guard, protect and cherish your land for there is no afterlife for a place that started out as Heaven."
1926?
that's ancient history, Dad.
the computer said you were a smart-ass.
and you never heard of computer error?
not this one.
take a look at that innocent little box, my boy.
it's hooked to all those computers you saw downstairs.
every scrap of processed information in the United States comes through here.
if it's out there, I can find it.
it heIps us keep track of the bad guys.
I can find out the temperature of your ass in that chair, if I reaIIy want to know.
but it won't do everything.
and that's why we got you here, Mr. Williams.
you're going to heIp remove some of the fiIth in there.
I like that. That's nice.
it's a Iot nicer than " kiII, " or " destroy, " or " terminate with extreme prejudice. "
that's what you're reaIIy taIking about, isn't it?
I think he's got it, Mr. Smith.
that's exactIy what we're taIking about, Mr. Williams.
suppose I say no?
then you're a dead son of a bitch.
and we aIready got a coffin.
how big is this organization?
just the three of us.
mac here wiII get you cIeaned up and briefed.
you start work Monday night, Mr. Williams.
here we are.
nice pad.
first hit. No big deaI. You'II get used to it.
nothing like throwing in a man at the deep end.
what's this guy done that's so speciaI?
come on, Remo, we run on a need-to-know basis. You know that.
don't take any chances. This guy's a kiIIer.
remember...
in, out, like a duck mating.
where are you gonna be? -Right behind you.
how do you open this?
speak EngIish?
does a nightingaIe sing?
yeah...
how do you get out of here? -The same way you came in.
no good.
there's a guy outside who wants me to knock off your boss.
I am here aIone.
there is no one upstairs.
okay, now Iook, Iet's not make any troubIe for each other.
all I wanna do is to get out of here.
it is too Iate for that.
hoId it! I don't want to kiII you, but I wiII if I have to.
I'll show you chop-socky, you sawed-off little runt.
Chiun, what do you think?
he is very sIow.
his refIexes are pitifuI.
pooriy coordinated.
he is in wretched physicaI condition.
impetuous.
and cIumsy.
he moves like a baboon with two cIub feet.
however...
there is a feebIe gIint of promise in his eyes.
I think I can do something with him.

Yes, George.
this is interesting.
someone's trying to enter a circuit I had marked for speciaI surveiIIance.
I wonder who the intruder is.
what's the matter? -I can't get what I'm Iooking for.
I hate to hear you say that.
why shouId the HARP be restricted?
maybe you've got coId hands.
aIIow me.
see?
do I sense frustration?
I'll bet you've had a Iot of experience with that.
if I continue to stroke these little keys here

no, Lieutenant, I'll seek satisfaction eIsewhere.

the computer is cIassifying cost overruns within the HARP database.
you know what I think about computers. -Sir, it's not a maIfunction.
maybe it hasn't been entered yet.
they're entered and avaiIabIe, otherwise access wouId not be denied.
generaI, I'm the senior W. C.A. I shouId have access to that information.
there's no reason for it to be withheId.
right. We do have a probIem. Just Iet me have a fuII report.

I reaIIy wouId appreciate action by the time I return from Fort Baxter.

never feeI you have to overdo it. You know what I mean?
it makes no difference to me that you're a woman.
that's good news, sir.
if it's any reassurance, it makes no difference to me that you're a man.
aII right, what have you done with the food?
a Korean fingerboard.
what are you staring at?
you can't see. -I can see.
then what're you wearing those for?
I wear gIasses so that I may see more.
a Korean fingerboard. Begin tapping your fingers.
sIowIy at first and then increasing the force.
with time, your naiIs wiII become hard, your fingers strong.

good morning, Jim. -Hi, Doc.
How're you feeling this morning? -Hey, never better.
coach Jenkins came by last night.
he told me that they're saving my place on the team.
when I'm out of here in a couple of weeks, I'm going right back on that squad.
what's the matter, Doc?
I'm sorry, Jim. I've got to level with you.
the leg has got to come off.
No!
I was gonna be an all-American.
well, now...
you can be all-American for courage.
doctor, does Linda know?
there's something else I've got to tell you, Jim.
what are you watching?
your country's one and onIy contribution to the art.
it concern famiIy...
Iove, honor, and courage.
aII that is nobIest in the human spirit.
it's a soap opera, for Christ's sakes.
you'II spoiI it.
it's pre-spoiIed. Look, it's 8: 00 and I haven't eaten aII day.
one minute to 8: 00. The trained mind does not need a watch.
watches are a confidence trick invented by the Swiss.
you wouId be better empIoyed deveIoping your pitifuI skiIIs...
than whining about your beIIy.
remember, perfection is a road...
not a destination. -I Iove it when you taIk like that.
and I wouId Iove it if you wouId kindIy concentrate on your practice.
keep the weight off your toes.
every man is occasionaIIy bIessed with Iuck.
now, down.
my pIeasure. Down is easy.
what happened?
you reIy on what you know, not what you see.
what is your probIem?
pathetic.
come on, it's onIy water. It won't bite you.
move it.
I said, move it.
everything okay? -Yeah, sure.
that's it, Damico, hide behind a Ieaf. No one wiII find you there.
don't just stand there! Get down there and heIp Johnson!
radio the base and get an ambuIance out here, on the doubIe.
Yes, sir.
hoffa, what the heII are you doing? Break out your first-aid kit. Now.
about this new weapon, sir.
I want to teII you something.
it's useIess, sir! -You're way out of Iine, soIdier!
sergeant! -Sir!
assembie the company. I want a weapons check.
Yes, sir.
sergeant, I want your report on my desk by 16: 00!
sir, we've got over 1 20 AR-60s in this company!
you heard what I said. Get to it.
Yes.
GeneraI Watson.
good morning, GeneraI.
we've got a probIem, George.
I'm sure you can handIe it, GeneraI.
a soIdier's been kiIIed by your new AR-60.
that's what they get paid for.
it bIew up in his face. I've got the report right here on my desk.
there'll have to be an inquiry.
Scott.
Scott, I suggest you Iose that report.
I can't do that.
listen to me, Watson.
UncIe Sam gave you your uniform. Just about everything eIse you got from me.
bury that report.
thank you, GeneraI.
there's too many idiots like him on the payroll.
breathe.
use the air.
do not waste it.
reIax. -ReIax.
wiII you hang there aII day...
or may we continue the exercise, pIease?
Jesus. -Concentrate! This is no time for prayer!
you are not here to sightsee.
that's it, kids. Lady Luck is watching you. She's got her eyes on you.
she hasn't got aII day. She's waiting for a crap game in Bensonhurst.
here we are, foIks.
seven hoops a doIIar. Everyone a winner. Sir!
you want to make your grandchiIdren happy?
drop a hoop on a bottIe, win a prize...
and you're gonna see their little faces Iight up.
and your money back, Gramps.
if you can teII me where you can buy one of these genuine...
handmade Taiwanese beauties.
just remember, I won it. He's mine.
so, if you will excuse me, young Dr. Hastings...
I must get up to the theater and scrub up.
it's a dangerous operation. It's never been tried before.
I promised that boy he's going to walk, and he's going to walk!
don't do it. If you fail, it could mean a malpractice suit.
think of your professional reputation.
that boy means more to me than all of my professional awards combined.
there's only one thing that worries me. -What's that?
whether his stepmother will permit the operation.
you see...
she's my ex-wife.
Where's Jim?
you shouldn't be here. -I said where's Jim?
miss, I'm sorry. You'll have to leave.
nobody is going to stop me from seeing my fiance.
what did you say? -Jim and I are engaged.
tune in at the same time tomorrow...
for our continuing saga of Beyond the Night.
brought to you by Continental Airlines, a new tradition in flying.
Jim is Ieaving the hospitaI.
great.
he's going to his mother's funeraI. -That's tough.
but I think the nurse likes him. -That's good.
however, there seems to be some compIication with the stepmother.
it wouId be better for you to eat this can than what is inside of it.
why must everything in this country be covered with...
'Monosodium gIutamate. " You can't even say it.
I can say " rat droppings. " It does not mean I want to eat them.
tomorrow, if you work weII, you may have a teaspoon fuII of honey in your rice.
but I make no promises.
you heard the sound of my fIexor tendons as I squeezed the trigger.
and I saw the fIutter of your metacarpaIs. Not bad.
that's two buIIets. ChiId's pIay.
when you can avoid six buIIets, then you wiII have accompIished something.
no rice.
no rice?
you forgot the rice.
maybe we can grow some.
maybe you wiII spare me your feebIe attempts at humor...
and save them for the shopkeeper at the corner.
he has exceIIent Chung-ju rice.
you used the other four yesterday.
I reIoaded.
with all due respect to the Major...
at this point in time, Ms. Fleming, cost overruns are immaterial.
the Air Force cannot evaluate HARP until HARP flies.
exactly my point. Mr. Chairman...
if I may be permitted to ask Mr. Grove a question.
when can we expect to see the HARP?
I can't beIieve what I'm hearing here today.
I've devoted my Iife to deveIoping better ways...
to defend this great country of ours.
I never raised the subject of your patriotism, Mr. Grove.
I shouId damn weII hope not.
if we could get back to the question at hand.
what about the CD-18, Major?
three months ahead of scheduIe and under budget.
ready for testing next week.
mount Promise. I know. GeneraI Watson and I wiII be there.
I'm impressed. This girl's got a lot of guts.
who? -Major FIeming.
she's the one who tried to tap into the Grove circuit.
if she's not carefuI, she'II wind up with her ass in a sling.
she's coming in to New York. Maybe you'd better sIow her down a bit.
every time she mentions HARP, our man Grove begins to get an itch.
I wonder why?
I want that bitch put on a very short Ieash.
shouId be right up your aIIey, Stone.
pick up your feet.
fioat.
fioat.
CongratuIations, Chiun.
bearing in mind that nature snubbed him crueIIy...
by denying him Korean birth...
I am not entireIy dissatisfied.
when wiII he be ready? -Ahead of time, I think.
Exceiient.
that means?
fifteen years. -Fifteen years?
if I cut a few corners, 14 and a haIf.
Chiun, I need to borrow him for a whiIe.
Emily, Jim's your son. -I'm only his stepmother.
but Margaret told me something just before she died.
what's that?
Jim's your son, too.
is it painfuI?
I was singing an oId Korean Iove song.
the race must be practiCally extinct.
Chiun, do you mind if I ask you something?
two more minutes. -No, I mean...
how oId are you? You are oId, aren't you?
for an apricot, yes.
for a head of Iettuce, even more so.
but for a mountain, I am not even begun in years.
for a man, I am just right.
now I know, don't I?
you ever been married?
I am the Master of Sinanju.
no women. Vows of ceIibacy. Eunuch. That sort of stuff?
you are trying to say something?
no, just...
what I'm saying is I've been cooped up in this rat hoIe for a whoIe month...
working my-- -Sex.
Yeah, sex! Now you're cooking. Maybe it's the breathing and the rice
lesson 36.
the 20 steps designed to bring a woman to sexuaI ecstasy.
though I personaIIy have rareIy found it necessary to go beyond seven...
to achieve bIiss.
go on, I'm Iistening.
with the Ieft hand, you Iocate the woman's puIse.
then, with the middIe finger...
and tapping in time with the puIse...
then what?
then you may put the rice in the bowI and we may eat.
what was the number of the Iesson this morning?
wasn't 36, I know that.
you wouId Call it " four. " I wouId Call it " embarrassing. "
you know, Chiun, there are times when I reaIIy like you.
of course. I am Chiun.
then there are times when I couId kiII you. -Good!
we wiII practice that after dinner!
major FIeming?
coionei Gayber is expecting you.
major FIeming, sir.
HeIIo, Major. I have the documents you requested.
Hi. -Hi.
that's a nice uniform.
great buttons.
buttons?
Taxi! Taxi! Oh, heII.
you can never get one when you want one.
Taxi!
let me do this. Looks like you got your hands fuII.
thanks very much for your heIp but I think I'll waIk.
got a probIem, buddy? -Get out of the way.
am I keeping you from something?
if you're in a hurry, aII you got to do is say so.
peopIe here in New York have manners. They don't Iean on their horns.
Jesus! Who's your dentist? Tiffany's?
excuse me. What are you doing to that boy?
unnecessary use of the horn, Officer.
I'll be unnecessary use of my nightstick on your thick skuII if you don't Iet him go.
whatever happened to poIice courtesy and that kind of stuff?
we save that buIIshit for the Upper East Side. I'll kick your white ass aII up and down this street if you don't stop kung-fuing that man's throat. Move it!
Yes, sir, ma'am. Anything you say. You're just doing your duty.
I'm just a simpIe Iaw-abiding citizen, Officer.
I said move it.
I don't like it, George. I don't like it at aII. Have you seen these photos Stone took?
we've got one phony-bird coIoneI pIaying footsies with one little Miss Know-It-AII...
who's dodging taiIs with one faceIess wonder...
who's so anonymous he doesn't have any record or fingerprints.
they're throwing some secret fraud-squad at us and we're fishing in the dark.
ObviousIy, but before I can shut them down I need to know who they are.
shake some trees, see who faIIs out.
shaken every tree I can find. Came up empty.
of course.
cause you haven't pIayed hard baII, like we did in Tennessee.
let's give them a body. See who cIaims it.
start with him.
couIdn't we skip this Iesson and move on a bit?
say, to Iesson number 36?
SiIence! The Emperor Smith is disgusted with your progress.
I've toId you, he's not an Emperor.
enough! You are using onIy a fraction of the power in your body and your brain.
Sinanju uses it aII.
that is its soIe secret...
its onIy strength.
you are here to conquer your chiIdish fear of heights.
when you have done so, we shaII meet beIow...
and start another exercise.
you got it, mister.
no probIem.
failing off a Iog. -I'll take mine now, Frankie.
what are you guys, crazy?
you got no right up here, mister. -Authorized personneI onIy.
that's to prevent accidents. -Suicide, that kind of thing.
look, I'm coming down, aII right?
you sure are. The short way.
holy shit, nobody knocks anymore.
get out of here, you perv.
I'm sorry, I thought this was my, uh, office.
Oh, ok, you must be the new, uh
Yeah, yeah, we just got married.
made my decision.
I'm gonna leave the F. D.N. Y.
Hey, captain, what are you doing here?
you're in the hospital. - What?
you had a heart attack, but you're fine.
Janet's pregnant.
wasn't planned, you know?
just happened.
I want this.
whether it's his or yours,
I want this child to replace what we lost.
dispatch, dispatch, 10-13, officer down.
dispatch, officer down. We need an ambulance.
Johnny's dead.
they shot him.
Hey. - Oh, hey.
a friend of Lou, so just...
nice.
Yeah, she's cute, huh? - Yeah.
she's a nun.
she's a nun...
until the end of the month.
you're bi, right?
Yeah.
bi guys are the best.
guys, I don't--I don't think I'm bi anymore.
I feel like I can't-- I can't eat when I'm not with you, you know?
I'm just...
shit, I--I love you, Natalie.
I didn't put my papers in. - Hmm?
things changed.
things stayed the same, but they changed.
you think I wanted this?
you think that I wanted that?
is that what you think, you son of a bitch?
shit!
Tommy! Tommy! Wake up.
please, tommy, wake up.
I remember driving there.
she looked...great.
she was, uh, wearing this dress.
she got all dressed up for dinner.
um, plus the--the light, you know, from sunset.
and, u and, uh...
so we started to talk.
blah blah this, blah blah that.
next thing you know, she's, uh, she's pissed at me.
um, I should mention here, um...
I've, uh...
I have a drinking problem, and, um, sometimes it's happened before with her.
I, uh...
I've had blackouts and she's had to...
piece the night back together for me.
so, that particular night I was drinking seltzer and she was drinking white wine, and after the conversation went south, she said she wanted to go inside and watch this television show about weasels--meerkats.
meerkat manor.
so we went inside and next thing you know, we're watching this show and the narrator is-- he gives the meerkats' names.
so there's this meerkat named Shakespeare and he gets bit by a scorpion, and there's some question about whether or not he's going to make it back to the home...
base, you know, the place where the rest of the meerkat tribe is and they -
I was really worried about the guy-- Shakespeare.
He's--he was looking--he was looking pretty bad.
and, uh...
next thing I know, I'm laying in the sand and--and, uh...
I can hear people screaming and...and...
this doesn't add up, Mr. Gavin.
I'm sorry? - Your story.
according to the facts we have in front of us, there were signs of an accelerant.
I don't know anything about...an accelerant.
you co-signed a fire insurance policy on the house and a life insurance policy on Mrs. Keefe 2 weeks before the fire.
no, I didn't.
Mr. Gavin, please.
I'm telling you, I think I would remember
you don't remember starting the fire.
how the hell can we expect you to remember signing the goddamn policies?
I didn't start the fire, ok?
listen to me.
we know. You're a dru a very convenient drinking problem.
it's a disease, ok?
so is cancer. Do you want to blame cancer blame cancer for the fire?
tell the truth, Mr. Gavin.
I'm telling the truth. - No, you're not.
Yes, I am. I am telling-- - No, you're not.
I'm telling the truth, ok?
we were inside.
I was on the couch.
she was in the easy chair.
we were watching the meerkats, ok?
look at you.
Shh...
you got him?
I got him.
go back to sleep.
I'm trying to get him to go to sleep.
do you have any idea what time it is?
3: 00 A. M. - It is?
Jesus Christ. - 3: 16, to be exact.
and I told you 12: 00, and I meant midnight, not noontime. What
we couldn't get out the club 'cause this group of guys, they were such assholes to tony, ok?
and then there was this group of girls.
Oh, my god, this one chick
she had this weird tattoo on her arm and, god, she was such a bitch.
she wanted tony to sign her tit.
and anyways, then we stopped for a burger.
then he had to stop and get gas, so then
wait, wait, wait. He's a he?
who?
Yeah, he's my boyfriend.
whatever happened to wh-- what's her name?
Yeah, whatever.
dad, that was so 6 months ago, ok?
I'm through with girls.
girls are crazy.
it was a phase I was going through.
Oh, your grandmother thought that, you know, me and your...
mom were just a phase, and look at us. Huh?
not now.
I mean, you know--and let me tell you something.
girls might be crazy, but girls are crazy all the time.
they're dependable.
guys are, you know--guys are just-- I mean, what's this guy doing signing--you know...
tits? - Breasts.
boobs. - Whatever.
he's a musician.

all right, that's just...
wait--what instrument does he play?
he's the lead singer.
he's not a musician, ok?
the 4 guys up on stage with hi are the musicians.
lead singer...
Jesus Christ, those are the guys who wear all the make-up and do all the drugs and sleep with all the chicks.
how old's this guy?
Jesus Christ, 26-year-old-- do you know how old that is in rock and roll years?
he's like 70, ok?
he's like the Clint Eastwood of rock and roll.
is that a hickey on your neck?
are--are you having...
sex with this guy?
that's none of your business, dad.
which is--I'll take as a-- a yes, ok?
hang on there, missy.
I have to go to the bathroom.
let me tell you something.
you're not fooling anybody.
Yeah. Yeah, oh, yeah.
I smelled the pot when you walked in, ok?
Yeah.
and I can smell the sex.
pot and sex--I can smell them both.
Yeah.
OK, dad.
OK. Reality check time, ok?
Yes, I have sex. - Shh.
Yeah, you heard me -
I just had sex, with tony, in his car, right after I smoked a big fat joint.
very funny.
Ve--what?
Jesus!
Oh, yeah.
the pot made me forget.
I also drink now.
tonight I had vodka, beer, and peppermint schnapps.
a lot of peppermint schnapps.
Hey! Hey!
I am telling your mother.
earth to dad.
she already knows.
Yeah, hey, hey.
get up. Get up.
not now, tommy. This is a bad idea.
sex always leads
no, no, no, no, no. That's not it.
Colleen is smoking pot.
I know.
you know? What do you mean, you know?
Yeah, and it's good pot, too, not the cheap shit we used to get.
great, great.
that's--that's a great attitude.
you know, I told you years ago, pot's a gateway drug.
so tonight she comes home, not only is she high, she's drunk.
what-- - Drunk, yeah.
shit-faced. Puked--yeah.
was she driving?
no, I think her 50-year-old boyfriend was handling the driving responsibilities.
uh, he's 26.
and that's good. That's good.
why is that good?
because he doesn't drink.
OK, but I'm pretty sure that she's banging this guy.
Yeah.
I know.
look, she's on the pill.
you put her on the pill?
is that--insane.
to--I mean, you got the whole toolbox going.
booze, penises.
I mean, I can't believe that I'm finally the moral compass in this family.
Yeah, well.
you're an enabler, that's what you are.
Yeah, yeah.
Shh.
when were you planning on telling me about this?
well, I was going to drop the sex bomb on you a while ago, but then this whole platonic living arrangement thing has been going so well.
Yeah.
you know, and then you always take the word "sex" as an invitation, so I didn't want to risk it.
and as for the pot and booze, well, check her birth certificate.
the last name's Gavin.
good night.
s-so that wasn't an invitation?
Oh, my god, get out of here.
daddy?
what's a sex bomb?
Oh, honey, that's, um-- tommy?
it's nothing, honey.
it's a, uh--it's nothing.
are you going to go to jail, dad?
no, who said I'm going to jail?
well, mom, cousin Eddie, father O'brien, all the kids at school.
I'm not--never mind father O'brien, ok?
I'm not going to jail.
smells like Christmas out here.
that's not Christmas, honey.
Oh.
happy holidays.
holy people, that on earth do dwell, sing to the Cheerful voice, lifts up with him his graceful sound, come kneel before him...
Saber...saber...
die, wizard!
die, die!
Yeah!
sorry.
I won.
Yeah.
Hey, you Hey, you won what?
what is that, the, uh, the conquest Trethfellon?
I reached level 60.
I need to find a new game now.
Yeah, but wait a second. That's not possible, Rich.
that's the conquest Trethfellon, right?
it's the most intricate, difficult
I kicked its ass!
it took Garrity 8 months to reach level 5.
you just beat the whole game in
4 hours, 9 minutes--nigger!
when are you going to marry my sister?
excuse me?
when are you going to marry her?
uh, we hadn't really-- I mean, you know, there's been a little conversation, but nothing, uh--oh, I get it.
you're, uh--you're worried that your sister and I are going to hook up and that you'll get left behind or sent off on your own.
is that it, rich?
nigger!
no, asshole.
I want her married so I can get on with my life.
Yeah, what life?
my life!
OK, Franco?
OK.
but I mean, you know, come on, let's be real.
you take classes at the center, you bag groceries at the food emporium like 3 days a week, and you sit around this apartment beating video games in record time.
I mean, other than that
I want to get laid, Franco.
how am I supposed to do that with my sister hanging around?
I'm horny.
nigger!
you do realize in order to get laid you got to have a girl, right?
I got a girl.
Really?
I'm going to smack your face.
what?
I got a girl.
her name is Barbara.
I met her at the center.
what, does she work there or is she one of the, uh, you know, your--your people
retards.
Yeah.
she has down syndrome.
she's partially deaf.
she's in a wheelchair.
but she's got the sweetest ass.
Yeah, but if she's in a wheelchair, how can you see it?
they stand her up sometimes.
um, listen, Natalie and I, we got no plans as far as marriage is concerned right now.
OK, as soon as that changes, Rich, I'll let you know.
make it fast.
I'm dying here.
yeah?
it's Dr. Brown.
I'm sorry--who?
Dr. Brown.
Jeff, is that you?
Jesus Christ, Eddie, you trying to get me shit-canned?
sorry, sorry, sorry. I forgot.
I got the test results.
And?
dead on.
Oh, shit.
are you sure?
Yep.
all even.
this is wrong.
I think that's enough. Ok.
Oh, yeah, that's rough.
Oh, god.
Oh, god.
Oh, god!
Oh, yeah, that's it, that's it, that's it.
just keep on saying that, 'cause if we get caught
I can always say that there was prayer involved.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
no, I can't, I can't.
I can't.
Theresa, I can't do this.
I'm sorry. - What?
just stop it, ok?
I was raised a catholic, for god sakes.
so I was a nun.
Oh, god.
shit!
uh, hi. Um, sorry.
just, um...
making sure the organ was ok.
it's, uh, it's fine.
bless you all.
Hey, hi, Maggie.

I just--I was-- I was going to take a walk down to the you know?
maybe get a--a muffin.
is that--is that the big box of porn?
Uh...oh, this box?
Yeah, this--this-- this might have some porn in it, yeah. Yeah.
you're throwing away the porn?
OK, look, Maggie, a lot of wives, they would thrilled if their husbands were throwing away the porn.
they would see it as a--as a mature and committed act, and--and I think you should see this as a real positive thing.
you know, that's all fine and good, Sean.
only it's my porn.
OK, well, you don't need it anymore, right?
cause you got me.
ha ha ha--put the box down.
come on, Maggie, I just want to be married for 2 seconds without the
no, now!
you see this box? - Yeah.
this box is your friend.
it might even be your best friend.
because it's the only thing breathing any life into our relationship at this point.
Maggie, we've been married 9 months.
wh-what are you talking about, breathing life into the relationship?
everyone needs breath.
everyone needs a spark, Sean!
OK, and the spark is by watching some chick get double-teamed by guys with cocks the size of telephone poles?
see, now you understand
no, I don't! I don't understand, maggie.
I don't think you understand, either, that I might have a problem with this.
that this might make me feel, you know--inferior.
Oh, but sean, you have nothing to feel inferior about. - Really?
well, except for the fact that your cock isn't as big as a tele a telephone pole, but that's
That's--ok, I'm going to work.
you know what? Enjoy your porn.
you don't want your cock to be that big.
your life would be terrible.
you would not be able to buy pants.
yeah?
how's my favorite health nut doing?
Hey, lost 5 more pounds.
Wow! What's that, 30 total?
35.0
I go in for my stress test in a couple of days and back to full duty.

Nope.

no, no, no, no, no.
I mean, that's--that's--that's really great.
great.

Yeah, uh, Pete, sure I will.
I, uh. I, uh...

I--I--honey, we got bigger problems than the puke, ok?
Colleen--sex with the boyfriend in front of the house last night, in the car.

neighbors could've seen it, you know?
what? - So did we.

she just turned 18.
I mean it's, you know
you got me pregnant when I was 17.
OK, that was-- - In your truck, while we were drinking, and on Quaaludes.
it was the seventies, ok?
Freddy Fender, pet rocks.
what did the super say?
he's working on it. He's, uh...
all right, you ready?
OK. - Ok.
ready?
ready ready.
nice. - Shh, shh, shh...
oh...Tom Tommy, you jinxed it.
I didn't jinx it.
he just-- he had--he drank his bottle too fast.
rub his back a little bit.
Oh, tommy, I know how to take care of kids.
I'm not telling you-- - I had 3 kids, you know?
I know. - I breastfed.
I bathed them, I diapered them.
I was just-- - This baby hates me.
he doesn't hate you.
he needs to have his back rubbed, ok?
just take him.
I just gave him to you.
honey, give him a couple more seconds.
take him.
look, don't...dwell on it, ok?
it's just--you know.
this baby hates me.
He--honey, he's a baby.
he doesn't even know what hate is.
he's a Gavin.
he was born to hate.
you know, come to think of it, I think he's all Gavin.
half Johnny, half you.
OK, you know what?
This--if he was half Johnny, he'd--he'd hate me, and he doesn't.
he loves me--look.
well, he still kind of looks like me, right?
I mean, he's got the blond peach fuzz coming in.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything.
in a couple of months, he could end up with a full head of jet black hair.
I got to go.
no, tommy, tommy, please don't go.
honey, I got to go to work, ok?
well, then we got to hire some help, because I am losing my mind here.
we went over this a million times, ok?
I--you know, I can't work any extra jobs right now because of the kids, so we don't have money to
no, I'm going to get a job.
did you just say that you're going to-- - Yeah. I'll get a job.
I have friends who can sit for me.
what are you going to--what are you going to do?
real estate.
well-- Like they--like you-- - I'm good in sales.
You--what? You're good at
OK, tommy, what if you end up in jail and the F. D.N. Y. Cancels your pension?
I'm not going to jail, ok?
tell you what, while you're out selling property, take little no-name with you and maybe he can sell some little tiny little properties -
thank you, dr. Laura.
I wonder if it's unhealthy to maintain a relationship with someone who's dead?
well, it's kind of one-sided.
Yeah, but it's-- - It's one-sided and
well, you can't call it a relationship. - Why not?
I can't
yeah?
Hey.
Hey, was that--was that dr. Laura?
Yeah, my radio froze. Dumb car, heater's not working.
what's going on? What's going on with teddy?
uh, giving the case to the jury within the week. Looks good for him.
for you? Not so much.
Hey, tom, I heard from my guy inside the insurance company...
Yeah, and? - It's definitely your signature on both policies.
life and fire. - Ok, I never signed anything.
Yeah, well, someone did. - Well, it wasn't me.
Jesus Christ, tom, you have got to pull your act together, you know?
every time you go in there, you give them a different story, which at this point is making things look very, very suspicious.
well, I--I can't remember everything, Eddie. All right?
Yeah, well, being a drunken fool is just not going to fly.
you know? Tom, make something up. - So you want me to lie?
Yes, through your goddamn teeth, I want you to lie.
well--I can't do that. - You--you
what's so funny?
you can't lie?
look, I can lie to, you know, my wife, my kids, the guys at work, you know?
the guys at headquarters--cops. Yeah, I can do that kind of lying.
that's like a ball, you know what I mean? But these--these are lawyers.
this is, you know--this is major league pitching here.
these guys, you know--I'm good, but I'm not that good.
listen to me.
we have got one more shot at this, tom, day after tomorrow. All right?
now you come up with a story that makes plausible sense, practical sense.
Oh, and wear a dress shirt, for Christ sakes, with a jacket.
asshole.
...Difficult one to explain. Her dad was married
Jesus...
Hey. - Hey.
Hey. What's going on?
freezing our balls off. The heat's out. Thank god for propane, you know?
uh, Fredo, you mentioned just a second ago, uh, propane.
interesting fun fact--did you know that propane is both a liquid and a gas?
at atmospheric pressure and temperatures above -44 Fahrenheit, it's a non-toxic, odorless, colorless gas, and like natural gas, it has an identifying odor added to it so it can be detected readily.
Yeah, you
you know, I still don't know what you guys like to talk about.
pussy. That's always a good choice.
Hey, this just in, chief. The power's out.
Ah, jeez, when it rains, it pours.
we're on so if you want to read or you want to take a shit or you want to do both at the same time, you better take one of these. Jesus, tommy, you look like shit.
I was up and down with the baby most of the night, ok, so
Oh, you know, you just missed your girlfriend-- - Not my girlfriend, ok?
second of all--barely a firefighter, ok? Volley. Goddamn volley.
Yeah, volley or no volley, she pulled your ass out of a fire, bro.
that alone, you owe her dinner, right?
OK, I'm going to take her to dinner, ok?
what's the big thing? I mean-- - There's no big thing.
she lifted you up off a hot melting floor, she slung you over her shoulder, - she carried you outside-- - allegedly.
like you yourself have done a million times.
Yeah, not to mention she probably slipped you a little tongue when she was giving you mouth-to-mouth. Right?
just like you yourself have done at least, you know
once. Ok? Did it once. Twice.
2 times, that was it. - Hey, you know what? This is really weird about this.
like the whole chick-saving-you thing, it's like a role reversal thing, you know?
it's like Lois lane saving superman.
my hoops are here. Guys, help my cousin unload this. Will you get Mikey, please?
what? What? What hoops? - Oh, basketball hoops.
Yeah, I got 2 brand-new backboards, N.B. A. Style.
I got floor paint, I got a brand-new box of balls, the whole 9 yards.
for what? - For the b-ball court we're putting in the basement.
Hey! B-ball-- - what?
Vito, how's it going?
3 hours on the goddamn B. Q.E. With
and cold goddamn coffee, that's how it's going.
OK, I thought we were putting a street hockey court in--in the basement.
Nope. Nixed--New York nixed. - Since when?
uh, since last night. Listen, I got a couple guys helping.
we're going to help you unload all this crap, ok?
what do you mean, since last night? I don't
we--we took a vote, ok? By email.
you can't--I don't do email. You can't take a vote by email.
what smells like puke?
you're a regular riot. Can I talk to you over here?
funny guy, my cousin. - Yeah, he's very funny.
so you guys took a vote and I'm not included? What's that about?
look, we--the crew decided that matters concerning the future of this house should be voted on by guys who are actually going to be here in the future.
OK, what? Huh? - Yeah, well, you know, the word on the street is you're going to jail.
OK, I don't know what street that is, but that's the wrong street, - 'cause I'm not going to jail. - I'm just saying
well, that's now what I hear. - Jesus.
I got a friend down at H. Q.
he says they're this close to getting rid of you.
Wh-what's your friend's name? - Kenny O'connell.
maybe he could help me out. - Nah, hates your guts.
Why? - Well, he says at some Christmas party a couple of years ago, - he was passed out-- - Shaved his eyebrows, yeah, yeah, yeah.
that Kenny O'connell, ok. Well-- - They never grew back.
Really? - Yeah.
that's a shame. - Yeah. Well, you know, I can give him a call.
it's better than seeing him in person. It's just...all forehead.
hey-- - Stay away from my balls.
did we or did we not have the worst firehouse basketball team in the history of firehouse basket basketball before 9/11, am I not wrong?
Yes--no, no, you're right. It's true, but that was back when all we had to offer was Franco and Nels and those 8 spastic giants from the engine, ok?
Yeah. What do you have to offer-- - Listen, my spies are telling me that coming through the Probie class right now is a black kid, Afro-American, as Kramer might say, who is so goddamn good as an outside shooter, people are calling him the next Jackie Ryan.
Jackie Ryan--the Jackie Ryan? - Yes, the Jackie Ryan.
and I'm making a play to get him assigned to this house, and if that happens, ok, you will notice a widening suspicious stain on the front of my person.
do not be alarmed.
just know that I'm very happy and go about your business.
uh, Mikey's laying down in the bunkroom.
so wake him up. - Yeah, I tried.
And? - I mean, I think he's
I think he's dead.
look at him. He looks so peaceful.
that's because he's an idiot.
it's his look. In a fire, after a fire, on his way home from a fire, awake, asleep, it's always the same look. You check his pulse?
I didn't--should I? - No, see--that's your look.
he's peaceful, you're befuddled. - Get out of the way.
uh, excuse me? Befuddled? - Confused.
you know, I'm really pissed off about this basketball thing.
excuse me, I know what befuddled means, thanks.
Yeah, it's because tommy just told you it means "confused," asshole.
no, it's not. I know because I just know, all right, jerk?
Yeah, yeah, he's alive. Hey, Mikey.
Hey, hey! - Mike, wake up, buddy. You alright?
Oh, thank god. Hey.
Oh, hey, guys. Wow. How long was I out for?
how the hell do we know? What time did you get here?
I don't know. I had a colon-scopy this morning-- - Colonoscopy.
Oh, and they give you drugs and stuff.
Yeah, I guess shoving a 5-foot long camera up your ass falls into the "and stuff" category.
well, my mom's been sick lately and there's a history of colon cancer in my family, so I thought I'd play it safe and check out the situation and stuff.
Yeah, you know, you say "and stuff" one more time, I'm going to shove my flashlight up your ass.
Yeah, that'd be the second time today.
Hey, did you vote "ye this basketball court thing?
you looked stressed out, tommy. - Yeah, a little stressed out.
the basketball thing, haven't had sex or a smoke in 9 months, and I just found out everybody I know pretty much thinks I'm going to jail, so, you know, yeah--stressed? Yeah, little bit.
well, hey, look at the bright side. - Which is what?
when you're in jail, there's probably going to be a lot of black guys, and they're probably going to play a lot of hoops.
so? - So when you get out, you'll be a lot better. Or good, at least.
see, that's his look. - What is it, angry?
murderous. - You're not getting that basketball court.
Yeah, what're you going to do, shiv me?
so are you a, uh--you're a cat lover? - I am, yeah.
you have cats at home? - I do. I have 4.
Oh, great, we--we have a bunch of cats trapped on the second or third floor.
Yeah, I heard them meowing and I went up there, but they're trapped up under this loft and they won't come down.
poor things, they got to be frozen solid. - Yeah, well, cat-sicles. My favorite treat.
all right, lads. Let's leave the tanks and bring the catnip.
Garrity, g-give him a hand. - Yeah.
was it wrong that I called? - Uh, no, no. Trapped cats.
you know, one man's blessing is another man's 911 call.
goddamn cats.
how come it's never anything worthwhile trapped inside a building, like gold ingots.
musket and ingots within 5 minutes.
sounds like someone's been playing scrabble with rain man again.
he had a lot of ts.
you're voting for that hockey rink. - What are you talking about?
you're voting for that hockey rink, or I'm buying Maggie more porn, yeah.
how did you know about that? - Big black cocks, oh, yeah.
I know about it--her favorite genre. Yeah, you're voting for that rink.
now, you see, this is a wonderful apartment if you were a young couple with kids.
you have, uh, nice--lots of room, you have a beautiful draft morning, noon, and night, and there's no view, which, in this neighborhood, is a huge selling point.
you know, I can smell the cats. I just can't see them.
well, you know what, if they smell like puke, it's you, tom.
Hey, where are these cats? - What are you asking me for?
come on, Franco, the one time we actually need you to find pussy...
holy Christ, what's this? - Everybody all right?
you all right, big guy? - Whoa! Mikey, you all right?
God, man! - Whoa! All right!
get him up, get him away from the building.
come on, tommy, we got to get out of here. Come on, buddy.
shit!
what the hell happened?
well, the floor went and took part of the exterior wall with it.
we slid right out of the side of the goddamn building.
Yeah, thank god for all these stuffed animals, man. We'd have been dead.
what's with him? - Oh, he took a 2x4 to the balls when he landed
first a colonoscopy, and then a 2x4. Busy day for this kid's taint. Incoming!
Jesus Christ.
well, at least we saved some of these cats, you know?
I got one. How many did we get altogether you think? Wait a second, where'd he go?
Yeah, tommy's got one. - Well, that's 2. That's pretty good.
well, you know, one's good. One's good.
man, hey. I think the power's back, guys. - Oh, nice--heat! Very nice.
Hey, boys, how's it going? - Hey, hey, hey!
Yeah. Had a buddy of mine owed me a favor over at con ed.
had him come and rehook the whole neighborhood grid up.
another guy I know came and kick-startd the boiler downstairs.
Tom, your wife called. I sent that same guy over to your building, - and the heat's up and running there good, too. - Nice.
you want some coffee, boys? - Yeah.
there's a fresh pot in there with some hot pizza in the kitchen.
all right! Thanks, chief. - Chief is back.
good man. - All right.
looking good, chief. - Thanks.
Hey, jerry. - Yeah, chief?
uh, I had a propane heater out here.
Yeah, down in the basement. - Thank you.
fun fact about propane-- - Pizza.
saw you by Sheila's old place the other day. How's Damien doing?
he's doing all right. He's like living in a studio over by N. Y.U.You know.
Yeah, it's got to be tough for him not having his mom around to do everything for him.
welcome to real life. - Yeah, no shit.
all right, fellas, here's the deal on the hoops situation.
Oh, we took a vote, chief. - No, there is no vote.
what do you think this is, a goddamn democracy?
I come back to full duty in 2 weeks, and I don't want to listen to the hockey half of the house bitching and moaning about the b-ball half.
so I solved it.
engine company's downstairs right now putting up one hoop and one hockey goal.
OK, so let me get this straight. Let me get this straight. We're going Halfsies?
halfsies it is. End of discussion.
now I'm going home so this goddamn pizza isn't throwing me off my diet.
enjoy, boys. - You're the man, chief.
you're the man.
I think what makes the most sense, and I've been trying to piece the evening together, is that she must have drugged me. I think
she couldn't get me to commit or submit to what she wanted, which was, you know, for me to give up my job as a fireman and to move into this house with her.
and I'll tell you something else--I'm
she mu she must have forged my name on documents for that house.
what, um, what substance do you believe she might have drugged you with?
but I...
...Viagra or something.
I'm not going to say that. - Just say it.
I'm not saying it. - Say it.
I'm not. - Say it.
get out of here. - Say it, wimp.
Hey, hey. - Oh, sorry, hey, it's me.
Hey. - Hi.
Hi. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you, but it seemed like you were having a really bad dream, so...
Oh, I was, yeah.
you ok? - Yeah. Oh, nice dress.
Oh--thank you.
I am, um, going to wear it to the dinner, so I'm glad you like it.
I got it at Barney'S. Usually I don't go there 'cause it's, you know, too fancy, but there's a warehouse sale twice a year, so I bought this and another one that I may wear, but probably this one.
um, dinner. - Yeah, next Tuesday night.
do my knees look chubby in this? - Uh, no. No.
it's a little Spanish place downtown and it's very, very expensive, and you're paying.
Oh, ok. Now, this is...Tuesday?
we're going out?
you know, after I saved your life, you asked me if there was anything that you could do for me - and I said, "yes, you can take me to dinner." - I--yeah.
really haven't mention so I decided to take the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground--give me your hand.
look, it's very difficult for me to get into the city.
so I need a few days notice. So Tuesday night--say it.
what? - Tuesday night--say it.
Yes. Ow, Tuesday. Tuesday. - Tuesday night - Tuesday, 7: 00. - Ok
Jesus. Ow. - No excuses.
OK, but-- - Ok. Listen, I'll call you Tuesday at 6: 00
and I will give you the name and the address of the place, and, uh, toodles.
OK, ok, you know, I have a brand-new baby at home.
Yeah, I don't care. - Uh, ok. And, you know, I have a wife.
tell me--an ex-wife. - But she lives with me.
0- Don't care. - Ok. Toodles. Ow.
are you sure you want to do his?
Yes, I--I've been thinking a lot about it and I think that the fact that you like porn is, um, really special, so I want to do it for us, you know?
rather than be freaked out by it, I want to just embrace it, you know?
I mean, you like some of my hobbies.
like what? - Uh, you know...walking.
um, and my trains. You really
OK, actually, you don't, but I am going to do it for us.
OK. - Ok, here we go. Ready?
OK.
Hey, baby, I haven't seen Richie since I got here.
where is he? - Uh, he called. He's at the center.
he's got some new friend down there or something.
Oh, right.
so, uh, I guess that means, you and me, we have some alone time, right?
I'm reading, Franco. - Oh, come on, you want to fool around?
I'm in the middle of a chapter.
well, you know what? I'm in the middle of a chapter, too.
it's chapter 7, actually--Franco needs sex.
Oh, ok, well, let's skip to another chapter. What's chapter 2?
uh, Franco needs sex. Don't even ask about the other chapters.
they're all Franco needs sex. - That's right.
except for the last chapter, which is Franco falls asleep after sex.
come on, baby. - Uh, I'm almost done reading.
give me 15 minutes.
you know, I, uh, I almost died today.
what? - Yeah. Yeah, we were in this, uh, this warehouse.
you know, the whole floor just--just collapsed.
it was a really weird fire.
if the side of the building hadn't blown out, the whole crew--we'd all be toast.
Oh, my god. You poor guy.
Oh, come here.
...guess I have to almost die more often, huh?
Oh, my god, that's so phony.
Maggie, come on--she's totally acting.
I've been with a lot of girls in my life and I've never heard a woman moan like that, ever.
no kidding. - What?
nothing.
Oh, and now the other guy shows up? Come on.
he's going to join in? That never happens. That's ridiculous.
what the hell's he going to do with the pepper mill?
Sean, that's not a pepper mill. - Oh, my god. Oh!
so what are you going to say?
well, I guess we're going to find out, huh?
you could just tell the truth.
which would be what?
that you were shit-faced and horny, and then we she got pissy and afraid, - you started pushing her around and telling her-- - That's not what happened, ok?
that's not the truth. - Don't talk over me now.
don't talk over me! - What are you doing, jimmy?
that's your M. O. With her, ok?
it's your M. O. With her and Janet. Just listen to me for
Oh, there was a, uh, a bee in there. I think I got him.
we've got $2 million on the line, and you are totally screwing this up.
holy shit, nobody knocks anymore.
get out of here, you perv.
I'm sorry, I thought this was my, uh, office.
Oh, ok, you must be the new, uh
Yeah, yeah, we just got married.
made my decision.
I'm gonna leave the F. D.N. Y.
Hey, captain, what are you doing here?
you're in the hospital. - What?
you had a heart attack, but you're fine.
Janet's pregnant.
wasn't planned, you know?
just happened.
I want this.
whether it's his or yours,
I want this child to replace what we lost.
dispatch, dispatch, 10-13, officer down.
dispatch, officer down. We need an ambulance.
Johnny's dead.
they shot him.
Hey. - Oh, hey.
a friend of Lou, so just...
nice.
Yeah, she's cute, huh? - Yeah.
she's a nun.
she's a nun...
until the end of the month.
you're bi, right?
Yeah.
bi guys are the best.
guys, I don't--I don't think I'm bi anymore.
I feel like I can't-- I can't eat when I'm not with you, you know?
I'm just...
shit, I--I love you, Natalie.
I didn't put my papers in. - Hmm?
things changed.
things stayed the same, but they changed.
you think I wanted this?
you think that I wanted that?
is that what you think, you son of a bitch?
shit!
Tommy! Tommy! Wake up.
please, tommy, wake up.
I remember driving there.
she looked...great.
she was, uh, wearing this dress.
she got all dressed up for dinner.
um, plus the--the light, you know, from sunset.
and, u and, uh...
so we started to talk.
blah blah this, blah blah that.
next thing you know, she's, uh, she's pissed at me.
um, I should mention here, um...
I've, uh...
I have a drinking problem, and, um, sometimes it's happened before with her.
I, uh...
I've had blackouts and she's had to...
piece the night back together for me.
so, that particular night I was drinking seltzer and she was drinking white wine, and after the conversation went south, she said she wanted to go inside and watch this television show about weasels--meerkats.
meerkat manor.
so we went inside and next thing you know, we're watching this show and the narrator is-- he gives the meerkats' names.
so there's this meerkat named Shakespeare and he gets bit by a scorpion, and there's some question about whether or not he's going to make it back to the home...
base, you know, the place where the rest of the meerkat tribe is and they -
I was really worried about the guy-- Shakespeare.
He's--he was looking--he was looking pretty bad.
and, uh...
next thing I know, I'm laying in the sand and--and, uh...
I can hear people screaming and...and...
this doesn't add up, Mr. Gavin.
I'm sorry? - Your story.
according to the facts we have in front of us, there were signs of an accelerant.
I don't know anything about...an accelerant.
you co-signed a fire insurance policy on the house and a life insurance policy on Mrs. Keefe 2 weeks before the fire.
no, I didn't.
Mr. Gavin, please.
I'm telling you, I think I would remember
you don't remember starting the fire.
how the hell can we expect you to remember signing the goddamn policies?
I didn't start the fire, ok?
listen to me.
we know. You're a dru a very convenient drinking problem.
it's a disease, ok?
so is cancer. Do you want to blame cancer blame cancer for the fire?
tell the truth, Mr. Gavin.
I'm telling the truth. - No, you're not.
Yes, I am. I am telling-- - No, you're not.
I'm telling the truth, ok?
we were inside.
I was on the couch.
she was in the easy chair.
we were watching the meerkats, ok?
look at you.
Shh...
you got him?
I got him.
go back to sleep.
I'm trying to get him to go to sleep.
do you have any idea what time it is?
3: 00 A. M. - It is?
Jesus Christ. - 3: 16, to be exact.
and I told you 12: 00, and I meant midnight, not noontime. What
we couldn't get out the club 'cause this group of guys, they were such assholes to tony, ok?
and then there was this group of girls.
Oh, my god, this one chick
she had this weird tattoo on her arm and, god, she was such a bitch.
she wanted tony to sign her tit.
and anyways, then we stopped for a burger.
then he had to stop and get gas, so then
wait, wait, wait. He's a he?
who?
Yeah, he's my boyfriend.
whatever happened to wh-- what's her name?
Yeah, whatever.
dad, that was so 6 months ago, ok?
I'm through with girls.
girls are crazy.
it was a phase I was going through.
Oh, your grandmother thought that, you know, me and your...
mom were just a phase, and look at us. Huh?
not now.
I mean, you know--and let me tell you something.
girls might be crazy, but girls are crazy all the time.
they're dependable.
guys are, you know--guys are just-- I mean, what's this guy doing signing--you know...
tits? - Breasts.
boobs. - Whatever.
he's a musician.

he's the lead singer.
he's not a musician, ok?
the 4 guys up on stage with hi are the musicians.
lead singer...
Jesus Christ, those are the guys who wear all the make-up and do all the drugs and sleep with all the chicks.
how old's this guy?
Jesus Christ, 26-year-old-- do you know how old that is in rock and roll years?
he's like 70, ok?
he's like the Clint Eastwood of rock and roll.
is that a hickey on your neck?
are--are you having...
sex with this guy?
that's none of your business, dad.
which is--I'll take as a-- a yes, ok?
hang on there, missy.
I have to go to the bathroom.
let me tell you something.
you're not fooling anybody.
Yeah. Yeah, oh, yeah.
I smelled the pot when you walked in, ok?
Yeah.

pot and sex--I can smell them both.
Yeah.
OK, dad.
OK. Reality check time, ok?
Yes, I have sex. - Shh.
Yeah, you heard me -
I just had sex, with tony, in his car, right after I smoked a big fat joint.
very funny.
Ve--what?
Jesus!
Oh, yeah.
the pot made me forget.
I also drink now.
tonight I had vodka, beer, and peppermint schnapps.
a lot of peppermint schnapps.
Hey! Hey!
I am telling your mother.

she already knows.
Yeah, hey, hey.

sex always leads
no, no, no, no, no. That's not it.
Colleen is smoking pot.
I know.
you know? What do you mean, you know?
Yeah, and it's good pot, too, not the cheap shit we used to get.
great, great.
that's--that's a great attitude.
you know, I told you years ago, pot's a gateway drug.
so tonight she comes home, not only is she high, she's drunk.
what-- - Drunk, yeah.
shit-faced. Puked--yeah.
was she driving?
no, I think her 50-year-old boyfriend was handling the driving responsibilities.
uh, he's 26.
and that's good. That's good.
why is that good?
because he doesn't drink.
OK, but I'm pretty sure that she's banging this guy.
Yeah.
I know.
look, she's on the pill.
you put her on the pill?
is that--insane.
to--I mean, you got the whole toolbox going.
booze, penises.
I mean, I can't believe that I'm finally the moral compass in this family.
Yeah, well.
you're an enabler, that's what you are.
Yeah, yeah.
Shh.
when were you planning on telling me about this?
well, I was going to drop the sex bomb on you a while ago, but then this whole platonic living arrangement thing has been going so well.
Yeah.
you know, and then you always take the word "sex" as an invitation, so I didn't want to risk it.
and as for the pot and booze, well, check her birth certificate.
the last name's Gavin.
good night.
s-so that wasn't an invitation?
Oh, my god, get out of here.
daddy?
what's a sex bomb?
Oh, honey, that's, um-- tommy?
it's nothing, honey.
it's a, uh--it's nothing.
are you going to go to jail, dad?
no, who said I'm going to jail?
well, mom, cousin Eddie, father O'brien, all the kids at school.
I'm not--never mind father O'brien, ok?
I'm not going to jail.
smells like Christmas out here.
that's not Christmas, honey.
Oh.
happy holidays.
holy people, that on earth do dwell, sing to the Cheerful voice, lifts up with him his graceful sound, come kneel before him...
Saber...saber...
die, wizard!
die, die!
Yeah!
sorry.
I won.
Yeah.
Hey, you Hey, you won what?
what is that, the, uh, the conquest Trethfellon?
I reached level 60.
I need to find a new game now.
Yeah, but wait a second. That's not possible, Rich.
that's the conquest Trethfellon, right?
it's the most intricate, difficult
I kicked its ass!
it took Garrity 8 months to reach level 5.
you just beat the whole game in
4 hours, 9 minutes--nigger!
when are you going to marry my sister?
excuse me?
when are you going to marry her?
uh, we hadn't really-- I mean, you know, there's been a little conversation, but nothing, uh--oh, I get it.
you're, uh--you're worried that your sister and I are going to hook up and that you'll get left behind or sent off on your own.
is that it, rich?
nigger!
no, asshole.
I want her married so I can get on with my life.
Yeah, what life?
my life!
OK, Franco?
OK.
but I mean, you know, come on, let's be real.
you take classes at the center, you bag groceries at the food emporium like 3 days a week, and you sit around this apartment beating video games in record time.
I mean, other than that
I want to get laid, Franco.
how am I supposed to do that with my sister hanging around?
I'm horny.
nigger!
you do realize in order to get laid you got to have a girl, right?
I got a girl.
Really?
I'm going to smack your face.
what?
I got a girl.
her name is Barbara.
I met her at the center.
what, does she work there or is she one of the, uh, you know, your--your people
retards.
Yeah.
she has down syndrome.
she's partially deaf.
she's in a wheelchair.
but she's got the sweetest ass.
Yeah, but if she's in a wheelchair, how can you see it?
they stand her up sometimes.
um, listen, Natalie and I, we got no plans as far as marriage is concerned right now.
OK, as soon as that changes, Rich, I'll let you know.
make it fast.
I'm dying here.
yeah?
it's Dr. Brown.
I'm sorry--who?
Dr. Brown.
Jeff, is that you?
Jesus Christ, Eddie, you trying to get me shit-canned?
sorry, sorry, sorry. I forgot.
I got the test results.
And?
dead on.
Oh, shit.
are you sure?
Yep.
all even.
this is wrong.
I think that's enough. Ok.
Oh, yeah, that's rough.
Oh, god.
Oh, god.
Oh, god!
Oh, yeah, that's it, that's it, that's it.
just keep on saying that, 'cause if we get caught
I can always say that there was prayer involved.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
no, I can't, I can't.
I can't.
Theresa, I can't do this.
I'm sorry. - What?
just stop it, ok?
I was raised a catholic, for god sakes.
so I was a nun.
Oh, god.
shit!
uh, hi. Um, sorry.
just, um...
making sure the organ was ok.
it's, uh, it's fine.
bless you all.
Hey, hi, Maggie.
are you going somewhere?
I just--I was-- I was going to take a walk down to the you know?
maybe get a--a muffin.
is that--is that the big box of porn?
Uh...oh, this box?
Yeah, this--this-- this might have some porn in it, yeah. Yeah.
you're throwing away the porn?
OK, look, Maggie, a lot of wives, they would thrilled if their husbands were throwing away the porn.
they would see it as a--as a mature and committed act, and--and I think you should see this as a real positive thing.
you know, that's all fine and good, Sean.
only it's my porn.
OK, well, you don't need it anymore, right?
cause you got me.
ha ha ha--put the box down.
come on, Maggie, I just want to be married for 2 seconds without the
no, now!
you see this box? - Yeah.
this box is your friend.
it might even be your best friend.
because it's the only thing breathing any life into our relationship at this point.
Maggie, we've been married 9 months.
wh-what are you talking about, breathing life into the relationship?
everyone needs breath.
everyone needs a spark, Sean!
OK, and the spark is by watching some chick get double-teamed by guys with cocks the size of telephone poles?
see, now you understand
no, I don't! I don't understand, maggie.
I don't think you understand, either, that I might have a problem with this.
that this might make me feel, you know--inferior.
Oh, but sean, you have nothing to feel inferior about. - Really?
well, except for the fact that your cock isn't as big as a tele a telephone pole, but that's
That's--ok, I'm going to work.
you know what? Enjoy your porn.
you don't want your cock to be that big.
your life would be terrible.
you would not be able to buy pants.
yeah?
how's my favorite health nut doing?
Hey, lost 5 more pounds.
Wow! What's that, 30 total?
35.0
I go in for my stress test in a couple of days and back to full duty.
that's great, pop.
Hey, uh, how you doing, kid?
I'm engaged.
what? You're kidding.
Nope.
who's the lucky girl?
my boyfriend.
you actually thought it was a woman?
no, no, no, no, no.
I mean, that's--that's--that's really great.
great.
is it legal?
in Massachusetts, yeah.
but, listen, it's not like a regular wedding service.
it's a commitment ceremony.
we exchange vows in front of friends and family, and I--I'd like you to...
sort of be my best man.
make a little speech.
dad, you there?
Yeah, uh, Pete, sure I will.
I, uh. I, uh...
there's nothing that would make me happier than to do that for you.
bullshit.
you got me there, but, uh...
I'll be there, and I'll be there with bells on.
that's great.
Thanks, dad.
Yeah, sur to kiss the bride, do I?
not on my lips.
gotcha!
I'll talk to you later, pop.
is that Oprah? - No.
Yeah, you, uh-- well, I was trying to get Sportscenter, b everywhere.
this is crazy.
it still smells like puke in here.
well, I--I used the glade.
well, did you use the suddenly spring or the delicate petals?
I--I--honey, we got bigger problems than the puke, ok?
Colleen--sex with the boyfriend in front of the house last night, in the car.
how about that?
neighbors could've seen it, you know?
what? - So did we.
honey, she's a kid.
she just turned 18.
I mean it's, you know
you got me pregnant when I was 17.
OK, that was-- - In your truck, while we were drinking, and on Quaaludes.
it was the seventies, ok?
Freddy Fender, pet rocks.
what did the super say?
he's working on it. He's, uh...
all right, you ready?
OK. - Ok.
ready?
ready ready.
nice. - Shh, shh, shh...
oh...Tom Tommy, you jinxed it.
I didn't jinx it.
he just-- he had--he drank his bottle too fast.
rub his back a little bit.
Oh, tommy, I know how to take care of kids.
I'm not telling you-- - I had 3 kids, you know?
I know. - I breastfed.
I bathed them, I diapered them.
I was just-- - This baby hates me.
he doesn't hate you.
he needs to have his back rubbed, ok?
just take him.
I just gave him to you.
honey, give him a couple more seconds.
take him.
look, don't...dwell on it, ok?
it's just--you know.
this baby hates me.
He--honey, he's a baby.
he doesn't even know what hate is.
he's a Gavin.
he was born to hate.
you know, come to think of it, I think he's all Gavin.
half Johnny, half you.
OK, you know what?
This--if he was half Johnny, he'd--he'd hate me, and he doesn't.
he loves me--look.
well, he still kind of looks like me, right?
I mean, he's got the blond peach fuzz coming in.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything.
in a couple of months, he could end up with a full head of jet black hair.
I got to go.
no, tommy, tommy, please don't go.
honey, I got to go to work, ok?
well, then we got to hire some help, because I am losing my mind here.
we went over this a million times, ok?
I--you know, I can't work any extra jobs right now because of the kids, so we don't have money to
no, I'm going to get a job.
did you just say that you're going to-- - Yeah. I'll get a job.
I have friends who can sit for me.
what are you going to--what are you going to do?
real estate.
well-- Like they--like you-- - I'm good in sales.
You--what? You're good at
OK, tommy, what if you end up in jail and the F. D.N. Y. Cancels your pension?
I'm not going to jail, ok?
tell you what, while you're out selling property, take little no-name with you and maybe he can sell some little tiny little properties -
thank you, dr. Laura.
I wonder if it's unhealthy to maintain a relationship with someone who's dead?
well, it's kind of one-sided.
Yeah, but it's-- - It's one-sided and
well, you can't call it a relationship. - Why not?
I can't
yeah?
Hey.
Hey, was that--was that dr. Laura?
Yeah, my radio froze. Dumb car, heater's not working.
what's going on? What's going on with teddy?
uh, giving the case to the jury within the week. Looks good for him.
for you? Not so much.
Hey, tom, I heard from my guy inside the insurance company...
Yeah, and? - It's definitely your signature on both policies.
life and fire. - Ok, I never signed anything.
Yeah, well, someone did. - Well, it wasn't me.
Jesus Christ, tom, you have got to pull your act together, you know?
every time you go in there, you give them a different story, which at this point is making things look very, very suspicious.
well, I--I can't remember everything, Eddie. All right?
Yeah, well, being a drunken fool is just not going to fly.
you know? Tom, make something up. - So you want me to lie?
Yes, through your goddamn teeth, I want you to lie.
well--I can't do that. - You--you
what's so funny?
you can't lie?
look, I can lie to, you know, my wife, my kids, the guys at work, you know?
the guys at headquarters--cops. Yeah, I can do that kind of lying.
that's like a ball, you know what I mean? But these--these are lawyers.
this is, you know--this is major league pitching here.
these guys, you know--I'm good, but I'm not that good.
listen to me.
we have got one more shot at this, tom, day after tomorrow. All right?
now you come up with a story that makes plausible sense, practical sense.
Oh, and wear a dress shirt, for Christ sakes, with a jacket.
asshole.
...Difficult one to explain. Her dad was married
Jesus...
Hey. - Hey.
Hey. What's going on?
freezing our balls off. The heat's out. Thank god for propane, you know?
uh, Fredo, you mentioned just a second ago, uh, propane.
interesting fun fact--did you know that propane is both a liquid and a gas?
at atmospheric pressure and temperatures above -44 Fahrenheit, it's a non-toxic, odorless, colorless gas, and like natural gas, it has an identifying odor added to it so it can be detected readily.
Yeah, you
you know, I still don't know what you guys like to talk about.
pussy. That's always a good choice.
Hey, this just in, chief. The power's out.
Ah, jeez, when it rains, it pours.
we're on so if you want to read or you want to take a shit or you want to do both at the same time, you better take one of these. Jesus, tommy, you look like shit.
I was up and down with the baby most of the night, ok, so
Oh, you know, you just missed your girlfriend-- - Not my girlfriend, ok?
second of all--barely a firefighter, ok? Volley. Goddamn volley.
Yeah, volley or no volley, she pulled your ass out of a fire, bro.
that alone, you owe her dinner, right?
OK, I'm going to take her to dinner, ok?
what's the big thing? I mean-- - There's no big thing.
she lifted you up off a hot melting floor, she slung you over her shoulder, - she carried you outside-- - allegedly.
like you yourself have done a million times.
Yeah, not to mention she probably slipped you a little tongue when she was giving you mouth-to-mouth. Right?
just like you yourself have done at least, you know
once. Ok? Did it once. Twice.
2 times, that was it. - Hey, you know what? This is really weird about this.
like the whole chick-saving-you thing, it's like a role reversal thing, you know?
it's like Lois lane saving superman.
my hoops are here. Guys, help my cousin unload this. Will you get Mikey, please?
what? What? What hoops? - Oh, basketball hoops.
Yeah, I got 2 brand-new backboards, N.B. A. Style.
I got floor paint, I got a brand-new box of balls, the whole 9 yards.
for what? - For the b-ball court we're putting in the basement.
Hey! B-ball-- - what?
Vito, how's it going?
3 hours on the goddamn B. Q.E. With
and cold goddamn coffee, that's how it's going.
OK, I thought we were putting a street hockey court in--in the basement.
Nope. Nixed--New York nixed. - Since when?
uh, since last night. Listen, I got a couple guys helping.
we're going to help you unload all this crap, ok?
what do you mean, since last night? I don't
we--we took a vote, ok? By email.
you can't--I don't do email. You can't take a vote by email.
what smells like puke?
you're a regular riot. Can I talk to you over here?
funny guy, my cousin. - Yeah, he's very funny.
so you guys took a vote and I'm not included? What's that about?
look, we--the crew decided that matters concerning the future of this house should be voted on by guys who are actually going to be here in the future.
OK, what? Huh? - Yeah, well, you know, the word on the street is you're going to jail.
OK, I don't know what street that is, but that's the wrong street, - 'cause I'm not going to jail. - I'm just saying
well, that's now what I hear. - Jesus.
I got a friend down at H. Q.
he says they're this close to getting rid of you.
Wh-what's your friend's name? - Kenny O'connell.
maybe he could help me out. - Nah, hates your guts.
Why? - Well, he says at some Christmas party a couple of years ago, - he was passed out-- - Shaved his eyebrows, yeah, yeah, yeah.
that Kenny O'connell, ok. Well-- - They never grew back.
Really? - Yeah.
that's a shame. - Yeah. Well, you know, I can give him a call.
it's better than seeing him in person. It's just...all forehead.
hey-- - Stay away from my balls.
did we or did we not have the worst firehouse basketball team in the history of firehouse basket basketball before 9/11, am I not wrong?
Yes--no, no, you're right. It's true, but that was back when all we had to offer was Franco and Nels and those 8 spastic giants from the engine, ok?
Yeah. What do you have to offer-- - Listen, my spies are telling me that coming through the Probie class right now is a black kid, Afro-American, as Kramer might say, who is so goddamn good as an outside shooter, people are calling him the next Jackie Ryan.
Jackie Ryan--the Jackie Ryan? - Yes, the Jackie Ryan.
and I'm making a play to get him assigned to this house, and if that happens, ok, you will notice a widening suspicious stain on the front of my person.
do not be alarmed.
just know that I'm very happy and go about your business.
uh, Mikey's laying down in the bunkroom.
so wake him up. - Yeah, I tried.
And? - I mean, I think he's
I think he's dead.
look at him. He looks so peaceful.
that's because he's an idiot.
it's his look. In a fire, after a fire, on his way home from a fire, awake, asleep, it's always the same look. You check his pulse?
I didn't--should I? - No, see--that's your look.
he's peaceful, you're befuddled. - Get out of the way.
uh, excuse me? Befuddled? - Confused.
you know, I'm really pissed off about this basketball thing.
excuse me, I know what befuddled means, thanks.
Yeah, it's because tommy just told you it means "confused," asshole.
no, it's not. I know because I just know, all right, jerk?
Yeah, yeah, he's alive. Hey, Mikey.
Hey, hey! - Mike, wake up, buddy. You alright?
Oh, thank god. Hey.
Oh, hey, guys. Wow. How long was I out for?
how the hell do we know? What time did you get here?
I don't know. I had a colon-scopy this morning-- - Colonoscopy.
Oh, and they give you drugs and stuff.
Yeah, I guess shoving a 5-foot long camera up your ass falls into the "and stuff" category.
well, my mom's been sick lately and there's a history of colon cancer in my family, so I thought I'd play it safe and check out the situation and stuff.
Yeah, you know, you say "and stuff" one more time, I'm going to shove my flashlight up your ass.
Yeah, that'd be the second time today.
Hey, did you vote "ye this basketball court thing?
you looked stressed out, tommy. - Yeah, a little stressed out.
the basketball thing, haven't had sex or a smoke in 9 months, and I just found out everybody I know pretty much thinks I'm going to jail, so, you know, yeah--stressed? Yeah, little bit.
well, hey, look at the bright side. - Which is what?
when you're in jail, there's probably going to be a lot of black guys, and they're probably going to play a lot of hoops.
so? - So when you get out, you'll be a lot better. Or good, at least.
see, that's his look. - What is it, angry?
murderous. - You're not getting that basketball court.
Yeah, what're you going to do, shiv me?
so are you a, uh--you're a cat lover? - I am, yeah.
you have cats at home? - I do. I have 4.
Oh, great, we--we have a bunch of cats trapped on the second or third floor.
Yeah, I heard them meowing and I went up there, but they're trapped up under this loft and they won't come down.
poor things, they got to be frozen solid. - Yeah, well, cat-sicles. My favorite treat.
all right, lads. Let's leave the tanks and bring the catnip.
Garrity, g-give him a hand. - Yeah.
was it wrong that I called? - Uh, no, no. Trapped cats.
you know, one man's blessing is another man's 911 call.
goddamn cats.
how come it's never anything worthwhile trapped inside a building, like gold ingots.
musket and ingots within 5 minutes.
sounds like someone's been playing scrabble with rain man again.
he had a lot of ts.
you're voting for that hockey rink. - What are you talking about?
you're voting for that hockey rink, or I'm buying Maggie more porn, yeah.
how did you know about that? - Big black cocks, oh, yeah.
I know about it--her favorite genre. Yeah, you're voting for that rink.
now, you see, this is a wonderful apartment if you were a young couple with kids.
you have, uh, nice--lots of room, you have a beautiful draft morning, noon, and night, and there's no view, which, in this neighborhood, is a huge selling point.
you know, I can smell the cats. I just can't see them.
well, you know what, if they smell like puke, it's you, tom.
Hey, where are these cats? - What are you asking me for?
come on, Franco, the one time we actually need you to find pussy...
holy Christ, what's this? - Everybody all right?
you all right, big guy? - Whoa! Mikey, you all right?
God, man! - Whoa! All right!
get him up, get him away from the building.
come on, tommy, we got to get out of here. Come on, buddy.
shit!
what the hell happened?
well, the floor went and took part of the exterior wall with it.
we slid right out of the side of the goddamn building.
Yeah, thank god for all these stuffed animals, man. We'd have been dead.
what's with him? - Oh, he took a 2x4 to the balls when he landed
first a colonoscopy, and then a 2x4. Busy day for this kid's taint. Incoming!
Jesus Christ.
well, at least we saved some of these cats, you know?
I got one. How many did we get altogether you think? Wait a second, where'd he go?
Yeah, tommy's got one. - Well, that's 2. That's pretty good.
well, you know, one's good. One's good.
man, hey. I think the power's back, guys. - Oh, nice--heat! Very nice.
Hey, boys, how's it going? - Hey, hey, hey!
Yeah. Had a buddy of mine owed me a favor over at con ed.
had him come and rehook the whole neighborhood grid up.
another guy I know came and kick-startd the boiler downstairs.
Tom, your wife called. I sent that same guy over to your building, - and the heat's up and running there good, too. - Nice.
you want some coffee, boys? - Yeah.
there's a fresh pot in there with some hot pizza in the kitchen.
all right! Thanks, chief. - Chief is back.
good man. - All right.
looking good, chief. - Thanks.
Hey, jerry. - Yeah, chief?
uh, I had a propane heater out here.
Yeah, down in the basement. - Thank you.
fun fact about propane-- - Pizza.
saw you by Sheila's old place the other day. How's Damien doing?
he's doing all right. He's like living in a studio over by N. Y.U.You know.
Yeah, it's got to be tough for him not having his mom around to do everything for him.
welcome to real life. - Yeah, no shit.
all right, fellas, here's the deal on the hoops situation.
Oh, we took a vote, chief. - No, there is no vote.
what do you think this is, a goddamn democracy?
I come back to full duty in 2 weeks, and I don't want to listen to the hockey half of the house bitching and moaning about the b-ball half.
so I solved it.
engine company's downstairs right now putting up one hoop and one hockey goal.
OK, so let me get this straight. Let me get this straight. We're going Halfsies?
halfsies it is. End of discussion.
now I'm going home so this goddamn pizza isn't throwing me off my diet.
enjoy, boys. - You're the man, chief.
you're the man.
I think what makes the most sense, and I've been trying to piece the evening together, is that she must have drugged me. I think
she couldn't get me to commit or submit to what she wanted, which was, you know, for me to give up my job as a fireman and to move into this house with her.
and I'll tell you something else--I'm
she mu she must have forged my name on documents for that house.
what, um, what substance do you believe she might have drugged you with?
but I...
...Viagra or something.
I'm not going to say that. - Just say it.
I'm not saying it. - Say it.
I'm not. - Say it.
get out of here. - Say it, wimp.
Hey, hey. - Oh, sorry, hey, it's me.
Hey. - Hi.
Hi. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you, but it seemed like you were having a really bad dream, so...
Oh, I was, yeah.
you ok? - Yeah. Oh, nice dress.
Oh--thank you.
I am, um, going to wear it to the dinner, so I'm glad you like it.
I got it at Barney'S. Usually I don't go there 'cause it's, you know, too fancy, but there's a warehouse sale twice a year, so I bought this and another one that I may wear, but probably this one.
um, dinner. - Yeah, next Tuesday night.
do my knees look chubby in this? - Uh, no. No.
it's a little Spanish place downtown and it's very, very expensive, and you're paying.
Oh, ok. Now, this is...Tuesday?
we're going out?
you know, after I saved your life, you asked me if there was anything that you could do for me - and I said, "yes, you can take me to dinner." - I--yeah.
really haven't mention so I decided to take the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground--give me your hand.
look, it's very difficult for me to get into the city.
so I need a few days notice. So Tuesday night--say it.
what? - Tuesday night--say it.
Yes. Ow, Tuesday. Tuesday. - Tuesday night - Tuesday, 7: 00. - Ok
Jesus. Ow. - No excuses.
OK, but-- - Ok. Listen, I'll call you Tuesday at 6: 00
and I will give you the name and the address of the place, and, uh, toodles.
OK, ok, you know, I have a brand-new baby at home.
Yeah, I don't care. - Uh, ok. And, you know, I have a wife.
tell me--an ex-wife. - But she lives with me.
0- Don't care. - Ok. Toodles. Ow.
are you sure you want to do his?
Yes, I--I've been thinking a lot about it and I think that the fact that you like porn is, um, really special, so I want to do it for us, you know?
rather than be freaked out by it, I want to just embrace it, you know?
I mean, you like some of my hobbies.
like what? - Uh, you know...walking.
um, and my trains. You really
OK, actually, you don't, but I am going to do it for us.
OK. - Ok, here we go. Ready?
OK.
Hey, baby, I haven't seen Richie since I got here.
where is he? - Uh, he called. He's at the center.
he's got some new friend down there or something.
Oh, right.
so, uh, I guess that means, you and me, we have some alone time, right?
I'm reading, Franco. - Oh, come on, you want to fool around?
I'm in the middle of a chapter.
well, you know what? I'm in the middle of a chapter, too.
it's chapter 7, actually--Franco needs sex.
Oh, ok, well, let's skip to another chapter. What's chapter 2?
uh, Franco needs sex. Don't even ask about the other chapters.
they're all Franco needs sex. - That's right.
except for the last chapter, which is Franco falls asleep after sex.
come on, baby. - Uh, I'm almost done reading.
give me 15 minutes.
you know, I, uh, I almost died today.
what? - Yeah. Yeah, we were in this, uh, this warehouse.
you know, the whole floor just--just collapsed.
it was a really weird fire.
if the side of the building hadn't blown out, the whole crew--we'd all be toast.
Oh, my god. You poor guy.
Oh, come here.
...guess I have to almost die more often, huh?
Oh, my god, that's so phony.
Maggie, come on--she's totally acting.
I've been with a lot of girls in my life and I've never heard a woman moan like that, ever.
no kidding. - What?
nothing.
Oh, and now the other guy shows up? Come on.
he's going to join in? That never happens. That's ridiculous.
what the hell's he going to do with the pepper mill?
Sean, that's not a pepper mill. - Oh, my god. Oh!
so what are you going to say?
well, I guess we're going to find out, huh?
you could just tell the truth.
which would be what?
that you were shit-faced and horny, and then we she got pissy and afraid, - you started pushing her around and telling her-- - That's not what happened, ok?
that's not the truth. - Don't talk over me now.
don't talk over me! - What are you doing, jimmy?
that's your M. O. With her, ok?
it's your M. O. With her and Janet. Just listen to me for
Oh, there was a, uh, a bee in there. I think I got him.
Oh, there was a, uh, a bee in there. I think I got him.
we've got $2 million on the line, and you are totally screwing this up.
what's this?
that, my dear nephew, is a rare bottle of irish whiskey.
little somethin' to wish you well on your first day back.
what gives?
we've come to the conclusion...
that you're a lost cause, and now we gotta cut you loose.
you got a great family, Tom.
look, I gotta tell you, bro, these kids, they need a dad.
Ah, yeah. Yeah.
well, come on, asshole. Do somethin' about it, then.
I think you're drinkin' too much.
I'm tryin' to explain somethin' to you here.
let's get a drink.
I get what you're tryin' to do here.
the tough love, it's old school. It's admirable.
I eat when I'm up. I eat when I'm down.
sounds like you're gonna eat yourself to death.
I think that's kinda the point.
Jesus christ.
Janet, I am so sorry.
seriously, stop beating yourself up. Ok?
it's-- look, nothing happened.
Hey. - Hey.
what are you doing here?
you two have got to be shitting me.
what?
well, well. The prodigal bum returns.
Yep. What's the matter?
what are you doing?
you know, you're, uh, supposed to treat the, uh, customers with a little honor and, uh, you know, nice.
that's a tall order in this place, the pricks I gotta deal with, present company most definitely included.
all right, strike one, dipshit. You don't bring your own bottle into a bar.
strike 2, no smokin'. Look, my name is on the lease now.
we are playin' by the rules of the great city and the state of new york.
so if you wanna drink that, smoke that, take it outside.
all right.
I'll take it outside. Why don't you come outside with me, pussy?
faggot. - Douche bag.
shit prick. - Dickweed.
nut sac. - Numbnuts.
Mo.
Mo.
unbelievable. - Hey.
Hey! - What?
where you goin'?
I'm goin' to the, uh, little girls' room, queer bait.
ass face.
great state of new york, my balls.
tell me.
this is your choice?
great.
Oh, boy.
just great.
you almost bite it, but no.
God decides you get another chance.
Yeah. - Wasn't your time.
and this-Ttommy, this is what you do with it?
it's pathetic. - Broken record, pal.
if it had been me walkin' out of those towers alive, you can bet you wouldn't find my drunken, pathetic irish ass in some backroom.
great.
I'd be singin' and dancin' in the street.
but to you-- life is piss to you.
life is nothin' but piss.
Hey, you're dead, ok?
you know, you're-- you're not even here, all right?
Tommy, that may be... - Bullshit.
but I'm a goddamn hero.
OK, get up.
you're the hero? Huh?
how about all the times I pulled your ass out of shit? Huh? Huh?
who was the hero then, asshole?
christ almighty, half the medals you had on your chest were because I didn't want-- goddamn want 'em!
it's over, hero!
the one time I take my goddamn eyes off you, you wander off, ends up bein' the biggest goddamn tragedy in the history of the fire service, huh?
and you're the hero, and I'm the goddamn goat?
I'm glad you're dead.
I'm glad you're dead, and I'm glad I'm alive.
stop it. What are you doing?
Ah, jesus christ.
Oh, my god.
how many times did I tell you not to ride your goddamn bike in the street?
no, you didn't tell me that day.
Yes, I did. I said it about 50 goddamn times.
I just wanted to show you my wheelie, dad.
you couldn't do a goddamn wheelie.
lifting your own-- - yes, i could.
lifting your front tire of your bike half an inch off the ground - is not a goddamn wheelie. - That's a wheelie.
stop usin' that whiny voice. - Mom said it was cool.
mom? Mom this. Mom that.
I'm sick of mom.
I knew you were gonna be a pussy.
I knew it.
you ruined things between me and your mother. You know that, right?
you happy now?
happy?
Hey. He still in there?
Yeah. Goin' strong.
you said he came in with a bottle.
Yeah. Whiskey. Good stuff.
how much of it was gone?
I don't know. Close to half.
he's still movin' around. That's impressive.
you know, god only knows what he's been up to.
one of his hands is all bloody.
Hey, listen.
take this. Buy him a couple more rounds.
what, you're kidding me, right?
no, no. Nail in the coffin, in case the bottle doesn't work.
you know, and then just, you know, let him sleep it off.
all right. - All right?
Yeah.
dad. - Coll. What's up?
are you ok? You sound kinda sick.
I'm fine.
fine.
just sick of a lot of assholes. That's what I'm sick of.
but I'm not sick of you. You know what?
glad you called. I wanted to tell you I love you, ok?
and I know I don't say that often enough, but I'm sayin' it now.
I love you. And I'll tell you somethin' else.
you know somethin' else?
you know, parents aren't supposed to say this, but I'm gonna say it.
you're my favorite. You're not supposed to have a favorite kid.
parents aren't supposed to pick a kid, but you were always my favorite. And you know what? I'll tell you why.
because you don't take any-- you got balls.
and you don't take any shit off anybody, and you never took no shit off nobody, and I
you know, that's why I love you.
what's goin' on? What are you doin'?
uh, um, could you come pick me up?
Yeah.
let me tell you somethin'.
you are smart and gorgeous, obviously.
and funny. - I know.
and you have a great attitude, and don't let that-- don't change that.
that's gotta-- that's gotta stay. That's a keeper.
smile. - What are you doin'?
I'm putting this on youtube. When dads drive drunk.
I'm not drunk. Lookit.
if I was drunk, could I do this?
lookit.
dad, put your hands on the wheel.
don't do that. - Stop it. I do this all the time.
no, you don't, not when I'm in the car.
don't do that when I'm in the car. - I could make a sport out of it.
I could win a gold medal. Here.
let me tell you somethin' else.
that's the thing with your mother, you know.
she was a blast.
and then, out of nowhere, she sucks.
now she's just a big pain in my balls.
no shit. You know, if I-- - Right.
if I had a pair of balls, there would be a giant pain in them, and it would be her.
did I say you were funny?
you ok with this? - Hell, yeah.
you heard what she said. - We can drink for free.
I know. And you have to
you have to learn how you can-- - I know.
adapt. You know what I mean?
Flex-- be flexible. Flexible.
hell, yeah.
don't tell shawn about this, because he'd get...
way freaked out.
I don't care about his disapproval. You shouldn't care about his...
right? - Totally.
you know what I mean? Don't tell your mother.
OK. - Ok?
this is just our-- - no. No.
OK. So...
you guys ready to roll?
Yeah. - Yeah.
to me.
could you just pull over? You're drivin' me crazy.
I wanna get out of the car. - I'm the responsible one.
I get to decide who does what, when, how.
my truck. My rules. My night.
give me my phone back. - No. No.
the phone is mine.
no, give me my phone back. - No, I'm not givin' you the phone back.

she's done bein' the punchin' bag, asshole!
what?
the next time you wanna get in a fight, you come find me.
you come find a man... - What are you talking about?'
instead of a woman. What, man? What? What?
Oh, so you didn't go over there after I left last night and start tearin' the place apart - like some kind of lunatic? - Over where? What are you talkin' about?
Janet's house!
I mean, come on,Tom! How much of a dick are you?!
you know how much you terrorized them?!
they went, and they spent the night at Janet's cousin's house in Jersey!
how do you feel about that?!
all right, all right, break it up! - Back it up.
break it up!
go to your neutral corner. We got bigger fish to fry.
Tommy, I been calling you all morning. Where is Colleen?
I don't know. - But you were with her last night, right?
no.
no-nobody's heard from Colleen since around 10: 00 last night.
yeah? - Ok.
she went out with somebody around 8: 30.
she didn't say who.
then Janet called her around, what, 10: 00, and she said you were comin' to pick her up. Now, where is she, Tommy?
where is she?!
I don't know.
Hey, hey. Listen, I just-- I just got up, guys.
I just-- I haven't even had coffee yet. Let me
let me take a piss and, uh, straighten myself out a little bit.
Yeah. Go wake up, Tom.
have a drink! - All right, all right. Come on.
you dick.
come on. Grab a seat.
so you don't remember pickin' her up?
remember her calling you?
is there a message from her on your phone?
Oh. Earrings. Lovely.
well, are they Colleen's?
no. Those are clip-ons. She hates clip-ons.
Yeah, I spent some time in my uncle's jewelry store when I was a kid.
these diamonds are real. - Well, they could be his, you know?
maybe he got so drunk last night, he put 'em on and a nice dress, maybe, uh, a little wig, some ladies' underwear and went out on the town.
it happens.
no. No messages from Colleen.
well, what exactly do you remember about last night?
mm, I rember plenty of stuff.
listen, let's just stay focused on Colleen, all right?
I've called her a hundred times.
her moms has been callin' her all mornin', and nothin', nada, man. She's off the grid, son.
well, maybe she doesn't wanna talk to you. Maybe she wants to talk to her old man.
that's-- that's Colleen's phone. That's her ring for you.
why-- why do I get a barkin' dog?
Yeah. Why not an Irish jig?
Yeah, or a drunk pukin' his guts out?
Colleen liked to take pictures on this thing.
girl gets a few drinks in her, she thinks she's goddamn annie leibovitz.
Annie leibovitz?
Boo-yah. Do I know my lady?
tons of new flicks from last night right here.
what do we got? All right, let me start from the beginning. Ohh!
what?
that's my new christmas card.
listen. - I don't wanna see that.
no, no. It was not my idea.
she wanted to do a little boudoir photography.
Yeah, it looks like a little booty photography.
Yeah, your ass looks kinda ashy.
Yeah, you might wanna do some squats, brother, tighten that shit up.
listen, my ass is tight enough, all right? I wouldn't talk about ashy, peewee.
I moisturize twice a day.
all right, just turn it off. Give
Oh, now this is charming.
you might wanna get this blown up for the next aa father-daughter night.
I hit somethin'. - Wait a minute.
what?
Tommy, who is this?
uh, I don't know.
well, this may help.
hair of the dog.
maybe, uh, knock somethin' loose up there, get the gears goin' again.
I don't know, Lou.
I mean, just the smell of that alone is
I don't know if I can get it down.
Jesus christ, you're a prize, Tom.
the sheer volume of booze you have tossed past your teeth for no good goddamn reason all these years, and now, now that it might actually do some good, now you loose your-- your thirst. Seriously?
all right.
all right, good.
empty your pockets. Let's see what we got.
I mean, so far, we got the earrings. We got the cell phone.
we got a napkin, a lighter.
Alice 501 cpw. that's, uh, central park west.

no, it was, uh, Henry Aaron, actually.
Hank Aaron. I don't really know him at all.
I don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. Sorry.
it was the sign. It was the name on a-- on a sign at a bar.
OK, there's a bar. There's a bar.
OK. Ok, thank you, hair of the dog.

Yeah. I'm already on it.
OK, bars named henderson's in the greater New York city area.
I got 6.
3 in Manhattan, one in Queens, one in Staten Island, and one in Jersey city. Any of those ring a bell, Tom?
no.

I got a picture in my wallet from--I don't have my wallet.
Ah, jesus. Listen. I have pictures of her upstairs.
all right, bring one down to Mike and Sean.
franco, you write down the addresses of these 6 places.

black Shawn, you stay here just in case she shows up, all right?
and moisturize your ass.
rest of you guys, let's go.
well, it looks like you been hangin' out with a higher class of broad.
too bad you can't remember.
well, that doesn't look good.
2, 900 bucks, and that's just for the glass.
Yeah, well, we're lookin' for a woman named Alice, 13h.
you and everybody else.
building management's been tryin' to call her all morning.
they want her to pay for this.
she broke the window? - Check it out.
she gets some asshole up to her place last night, both drunk as skunks.
is only up there maybe an hour, comes down, pukes his guts out in a planter in the lobby, - and it's green. - The planter?
the puke. Green.
doorman goes to grab this asshole. They tussle a little bit.
before you know it, poor Tony comes flyin' through the window, and tony is not a young guy. Uh, excuse me a second.
any chance, uh, you're the asshole in that, uh, story?
you! You!
it's him! It's the green-puking asshole!
it's him? Go get him!
police! Police! - Hey! Hey!
no.
I was here all last night and never saw her.
and I've got a pornographic memory when it comes to chicks.
you mean photographic?
Hey, you got your memory. I got mine.
what are you guys, cops?
no. Firefighters.
jeez, why don't you say so? Sit down.
have a pop on the house. - Thanks.
sweet. - Thank you, man.
Hey, guys, we're kinda busy, remember?
that's right. We do have 5 more bars to get to.
it's on the house, dudes.
good point. - Yeah.
all right, we'll make it a short one. - Yeah?
or a regular one and we drink it fast, bro.
another good point. You're 2 for 2, bro. Here you go. Damian.
what? - You hold these.
you will be the d.
what's that?
the designated...
hitter.
Hey.
Yeah, so what-- is this the new chapter?
what? - Huh?
the new Tommy that loves his family so much?!
where is she?!
so help me, god, if something happened to her!
Hey, hey. Janet, stop. This isn't gonna help.
leave her alone. Leave her alone.
Hey, look, man. I'm tryin' to help you out, all right?
had to be Franco, huh?
you-- do you really hate me that much?
all right, I-- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Oh, you know what you said.
what? What did I say?
Oh, goddamn it.
you-- let me tell you somethin', ok?
if I find out that you slept with him, then you won't see those kids again, ok?
you know what you goddamn said, Tommy!
Janet. Janet. Relax. Relax. Relax.
that's enough. Let's go in the back and calm down.
how's it goin', boss?
not so good. - No word yet, huh?
Nope.
is he out?
you at Sheila's last night?
why would I be at Sheila's? - I don't know.
were you at Sheila's last night? - I don't know, but for some strange reason, I seem to remember you bein' at sheila's last night.
why don't we solve one mystery at a time, huh, Scooby?
Hey, kid, I just want you to know I would have never called her to meet up with me had I known this was gonna happen.
what do you mean? What
we been gettin' together.
I been talkin' to her, tryin' to straighten her out on the drinkin' thing.
we're havin' a good time.
she says she's gotta use the can.
she splits on me.
so I call Jan, and Jan calls Colleen, and Colleen said you were pickin' her up.
I was.
Tom, did Colleen get into that bottle that we gave you?
what bottle?
the fancy bottle of whiskey we gave you as a farewell gift.
we know you got into it, but we just kinda need to know if Colleen got into it.
Why? What's the big deal?
listen, I know we were at the bar, Eddie said that you got into it and it was half full.
so what?
what?
it's-- goddamn it.
we laced the bottle.
what?
we laced the bottle.
Jesus christ.
uh, it was a last-ditch effort, honey, to get him to stop.
you really think we'd walk away without tryin' everything?
you're our family, Tom, our own flesh and blood.
we love you.
Yeah, you love me.
Yeah.
you loved me enough to poison me.
pretty much.
I swear to god! - Come on, guys!
stop it! Stop it!
you-- break it up! Enough!
both of you, stop it. Stop it!
damn it, Tommy, it was gonna come to this sooner or later, ok?
it didn't matter if you did it or somebody else gave you a push.
you were gonna end up dead.
OK, this is it, Tommy.
you have finally hit rock bottom.
and maybe you can't see it, but they did a good thing.
we did.
you goddamn idiots.
well, you did a good thing for him, but did you stop and think about somebody else getting into that bottle?
your niece, for example. - Never came into our heads.
you gotta believe me. I mean, look at him.
look at him. It's him.
Tommy Gavin, you give him a bottle of top-shelf Irish whiskey, the last thing
you gotta believe-- we thought he was gonna do was share with anybody.
to be honest, the only dangerous thing we thought about was findin' him with his head stuck in the bottle tryin' to suck out the last drop.
so my little girl is out there sick somewhere.
we'll find her, honey.
don't-- don't worry, Janet.
we-- we got a meeting set up with Johnny's old partner. We're gonna start a missing persons thing.
no, but shouldn't that be happening already?
well, I mean, technically you gotta wait 24 hours.
but we'll get him to put a jump on it.
I-if you hear anything, call us.
this is all my fault.
goddamn it.
shit.
just find our daughter, Tommy.
if it is the last thing that you ever do for me, you find her, and you bring her home.
God.
are you wearing a thong?
Yep.
don't know why.
take another one.
OK, enough.
enough. Enough. How many-- how many you got in there?
jeez. I feel like Brad and Angelina Jolie, except I don't have her tits or vagina.
you can have mine.
there's never any hot guys in this shit hole.
you know what? This is a shit hole.
I don't know why a good-lookin broad like you's in here.
well, I told you. My-- my son, - he's like the manager or-- - I'm sure he's a
Oh! There he is. Hank!
come here a second. - Hey.
come to mommy. Look at what Ii found.
a fireman.
Hey. - Hey.
what's up? - Yeah.
and this is his darling daughter, Colleen.
it's Colleen. - Colleen.
it's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
Hey, any word on Colleen? - No.
how's Janet holding up? - Aw, great.
she went back to the apartment to see if, uh, Colleen shows up.
Hey, did I, uh
did I show up at your apartment last night?
you don't rember?
uh, fuzzy. - Uh, yeah.
you showed up, and you were high as a balloon at the goddamn macy's parade.
was, uh
who was there? Was there any-- was there somebody else?
what do you mean? - Was Mickey there?
Mickey who? - Mickey the mouse.
Uh-huh. Ok, what would Mickey be doing at my apartment in the middle of the night?
is he out?
right.
pretty girl, but no. I never seen her in here before.
well, this would have been last night.
didn't see her last night.
but you were here?
last night? - Yeah.
no.
wait. This is last night you're askin' about?
Yes. - Yes.
Yes, what? - I wasn't here.
who was here?
lots of people, imagine, folks drinkin' and what.
no, no, no. We mean tending bar. - My brother Seamus.
he'll be here in about 20 minutes, if you care to wait.
maybe we should hang, dude, you know? This is the last henderson's in the city, and it'll save us the drive if it is the right place, right?
good point, bro. Again. God, you're on fire.
I am on fire, dude.
we'll hang. - Guys.
are you gentleman police officers? - Fdny.
well, set yourselves down.
I'll pour you a little somethin' free of charge.
Ah, hey. Thanks, man. - Sweet, dude.
I feel shitty sayin' it, but I can get used to this whole missing persons thing.
what about a-- what about another drink,Tom?
maybe it'll help nudge some more information up to the surface.
Oh, god. I don't
what are you doin' here, Tommy?
why are you still here?
you know, if she was my child, you know, my own flesh and blood, I wouldn't be sittin' here on my ass, waitin' for her to sashay through the door.
I'd be out there right now looking under every goddamn rock in every city!
listen, I-- no, I don't give a shit!
all right?! No, no, you lost her!
you find her! Now, Tommy! You find her!
I think-- goddamn it. Come here.
hello.
no, I think you have the wrong number.
my friend from last night?
where did we meet?
Hey.
where are you goin'?
we're just gonna watch some tv up in hank's room.
Oh, let 'em go and have some fun. They're both good kids.
it's not like anything bad's gonna happen. I mean, she's got condoms.
wait a minute. What?
Th-th-- whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
condoms?
sorry.
I mean-- uhh.
shit.
good. Good.
OK. That's it.
let's get your jacket-- - no.
you know what? Actually, forget your jacket.
we're not getting your jacket. - No, daddy!
stop it! No! - Let's go.
you can make a new jacket out of your-- your condoms.
you-- go ahead. Hey. Come on, honey.
condoms.
I can't believe that you are wearing a thong.
OK, of all the reactions I've had to that particular situation, this is the first one that involves anger.
did I not ask you twice, twice to wear a thong?
once, 2 easters ago, um, with the tequila, and then on fourth of july on the beach with the champagne.
it was 3 times, ok? You're forgetting the rosh hashana bender.
I guess you just don't buy enough alcohol.
or I don't buy cheap polyester, look at me. I'm a whore, colored thong.
OK, I'm not a whore, all right?
did you sleep with her, or did you just go through her panty drawer?
I don't rember, ok? I do remember this-- her name is Jean, and she had a great ass and great tits, and she had legs that went on for
Tommy. You stud. Ha ha.
I never thought I'd see you again, you know, after the way you stormed out last night.
Hi. - Hi.
is Jean home?
Oh, you silly. Come here. Oh, come on.
she didn't come back here, as far as I know.
well, maybe she met up with your son.
is he here? You could ask him, maybe.
no skin off my hump.
Hank! - What?!
can you come down for a sec? - I'm busy!
probably masturbatin'.
he-- he sees a therapist about it.
come down. We have guests.
damn it!
I-- I think i might have a pair of your earrings.
Oh, it can't be mine. No, see, my-- my lobes, they-- they're prone to infection.
Oh, good. So I'm not the only one.
are you missing any underwear?
I don't wear underwear.
be nice.
you remember Ttommy from last night.
Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize you without your tongue halfway down my mother's throat.
that's not pleasant. - Kiss my balls?
you know, maybe if I did, you wouldn't jerk off so much.
I don't jerk off!
sorry. - So, uh, Jean, this, uh
this bar where you met Tommy and Colleen last night...
Henderson's. - Yeah. Where exactly is that?
we were thinkin' about maybe stoppin' over there and checkin' the place out.
Oh, it's really close by, but I don't know where Henderson's is.
see, we met at a place called the rockaway beach inn.
I know every bar for miles around.
there's no Henderson's.
well, it's not like we expected to find her waitin' for us in there.
no, but we are gonna find her, Tommy.
I know, but she could be 50 feet away in some basement here.
she could be 50 miles away in, you know, some back alley.
how cold do you think it's gonna get tonight?
don't worry. We'll find her.
we are. We will. We are gonna find her.
I say we grab some coffee, we assemble whatever troops we have, he head back to the rockaways, we do an organized search, and we don't leave until we find her.
maybe Mickey and Teddy already have some information...About...
Hi. - Hi.
rember me?
Sh-yeah.
I'm sorry for showing up unannounced, but, um, I'd just like my earrings back.
of course you can have your earrings back. I have them right here.
there you go. - Thank you.
maybe I shouldn't have done it, but I took a few pictures last night of us, but mostly of you.
someone was too shitfaced to perform.
I-I'm sorry, but what-- what was your name again?
before I forget, you owe me $14 for a new bottle of creme de menthe.
the only booze I had in the place, and he drained it.
that would explain the green lips.
OK, you said somethin' about some pictures.
well, he was in my bed, and nothing was happening, so I thought I'd have some fun, so I got my earrings and some hair extensions...
Oh, yeah. Go to the next one. Go to the next one.
that's my favorite.
all right, let me see. - Oh, my god.
it's really not that funny. - My heart.
you are my new best friend.
OK, everybody's had their little fun. You got your earrings.
I think we're done here. See, now you've made him mad.
now you won't get your thong back.
you have no right to be angry.
I mean, I'm the one who ended up with an empty bottle of creme de menthe and a bedroom full of sand.
good-bye, everybody. - Good-bye!!
all right. All right, the last time I'm gonna say it.
goddamn it!
fine!
God...
Damian, you come with me. We'll do a sweep from here up.
what's up? - Ahh...I'm good here.
you said stick together. - And now I'm saying unstick. Go.
I know I got the brains and the balls to do the job, all right?
maybe I can make just as big a difference in the world doing something else.
yeah? What else? What else?
off the top of my head, how about something that doesn't involve me getting fried up in a fire?
you know, we can give this one more shot. - Ok.
OK, but this is the last time, and there are no outside distractions...
none. - And no sheila, and if I find out that you guys have seen each other afterwards or if there is anything going on between you
nothing. Nothing.
this isn't over because you crawled over here with your tail tucked between your legs.
it is over because I decided it was over ages ago.
Oh, yeah.
the sex sucked.
you got to be shitting me.
Oh, mickey, no. Mickey, no. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Mickey-- who are you calling?
if he calls janet or shows up at my house, I'm dead.
anybody, um, call? - Huh? Nope.
nobody called. - Katy, dinner.
Hey, cuz.
Mickey, I am so glad that you stopped by.
and you're having my favorite dish.
I mean, come on. What are the odds of that?
you just moved into a new place, didn't you?
mm, over in brooklyn.
how is it? - It's nice, plus I got all this nice, new furniture because sheila just moved and I got her old stuff.
it's nice. She's got this beautiful place over in chelsea, unbelievable.
you been there, tommy?
yes? No?
as you know, sheila likes to move around a lot.
she's kind of a real estate gypsy.
every time she moves, she buys a new set of furniture.
this one went in my favor, but she has a beautiful new place.
mm, you sure you haven't been there?
anyway, I love my new neighborhood. It's very hip.
on the other hand, sheila's new neighborhood is much more
I don't know. How would you describe sheila's new neighborhood, tom?
what, are you choking? - Yeah. He's choking.
no. - Yes. Tommy?
Tommy, you ok? - Dad?
dad... - You ok, sweetheart?
Tommy, do you need some water?
hold, hold. Hold on.
do you need water?
Oh, he does need it. - Yes. That's what I said.
here, tommy. Dad, drink some water.
are you ok? Are you ok?
dad, can you breathe?
uncle mickey, do something. - Do something. He can't breathe.
dad, dad, are you ok? Just drink some more water.
Oh, my god. Mickey, do something. - Good? Is that good?
here, here, here.
Katy, get the door. - Hit him harder.
Hey, dad-- - Here you go. Here you go.
Hey. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bang.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
OK. Look. Look.
nothing happened. We didn't do anything. Are you ok?
what the hell did you do to him?
Tommy was choking, and mickey saved him.
you really got to learn how to chew your food, tommy.
kids, go get some ice cream. - I don't want ice cream.
then go to the movies. - There's nothing to see.
then go shopping.
there. - And buy what, a sock?
there you go, then.
how long do you want us to be gone for?
at least an hour.
how about one hour or $1, 000, whichever comes first?
well, how about you charge one cent over $100, and you don't have to worry about coming home?
Oh, is that 100 for each of us or total-- - go.
fine. I'm going.
anything you want to say to start?
what the hell is going on? - I'll tell you what's going on.
these two, I walk in, on top of each other, her with the dress off.
OK. I can explain that. - Oh, really?
you can explain that? - Yes. I can.
Oh, can you explain einstein's theory of relativity? That would be a lot easier.
that's the thing where the apple falls on his head.
Sheila, you, dress off. We're all ears.
OK. First of all, completely innocent.
well, I mean, well, not completely innocent.
obviously, you saw what you saw, but what you saw was not what you thought you saw.
it wasn't. Honey, I'm telling you, it was not
could you explain it? - Ok. Look. This is what happened.
he grabbed me from behind. He kissed me-- french-kissed me, that is
threw me down on the couch and tore off my dress.
what? When-- - you didn't do that?
Yes. No. - Oh, my god.
it wasn't all I did. It was-- - jesus.
no, no. We did, that we did.
he was like an animal. - Oh, I was like an animal.
I told you to leave. - Like you really wanted me to leave.
just shut up.
did you or did you not take her dress off?
Yes, but-- - thank you.
I did a lot of other stuff before that. - Oh, such as?
such as, he made a couple more moves on me which had none effect on me.
I told him to get out, which was when he grabbed me again.
what are you-- what?
what, you're gonna lie about that, too?
I'm lying. Ha ha! - Oh, stop.
did you?
did i-- did I what? Did I lie? No. I didn't lie. I'm not lying. What?
did you kiss her, and did she ask you to leave?
Yes, but
now I'm gonna punch him in the face right now, I swear.
no, not yet.
the thing is, she said that after I told her that it was over because I told her that you and me-- you and me we're gonna be, you know
it's "you and i." - oh, I know. His grammar is such shit.
stay out of this.
and then she gave me this angry, sexy...Look, like a vixeny thing.
Vixeny? - Yes. Yes.
it was vixeny, and then, you know, yes, we both-- we were kissing each other.
we kissed each other. We kissed each other, and then we were on the couch, and then we were both, you know...With the clothes, but then we both realized how stupid and idiotic and stupid that this was, and we stopped.
pretty sure that I stopped first. - Oh, I call bullshit. I stopped first.
honey, I stopped first. - Uh, listen.
Mickey, I told him what a fabulous kisser I think that you are, - didn't i? - Yes.
and that I care deeply for you, - didn't i? - Yep.
care deeply? - Yeah.
OK. - Yeah. I said that right from the start.
do you love him? - Not anymore.
are you in love with her?
have you ever been in love with her?
you prick. You're such a...
wait. But-- - b-b-- what?
listen. I-- obviously, i, you know
I cared deeply at
I did, but i
I love you. You know that. She knows that.
I love you, and i've always been in love with you, and I'm always gonna be in love with you.
Yeah, except for the 5 years when you were with me when you said it was all your could do to keep from strangling her.
listen, janet. We had a thing. We had a hot and torrid thing that, despite what he says, involved love and passion and insane excess, but, mickey, that's all tonight was about.
it was these final dying embers of this lust and this connection that we had.
I told him to leave because I treasure what it is that i've discovered with you, and he took that as a challenge, and so, yeah, whatever. We went at it for a couple of seconds, but then I stopped it because I knew that it had to end. I knew what his janet plan was.
I knew that he was still in love with her, but, more importantly,
I knew how I felt about you.
well-- - shut up.
I believe her. - Oh...
I do, too. - But
what?
Hey, you think-- you think they went in there to have sex?
what? Why do you think that? - To get back at us.
Oh, my god, what are you, 12? You really think that's what they're doing?
no.
Yes.
you never loved me? - Of course I loved you, ok?
I'm sure you felt the same way about me, but I obviously always was in love with janet, and you were always in love with jimmy. I mean, let's face the facts.
just don't tell me you love mickey. There's no way you love mickey.
I think that I could learn to love mickey.
Oh, my god, get off, tommy.
that's the end of it.
she's with me from now on, all right? I'm gonna talk to damian, and from now on, you stay away from her and him. You got it?
good. Let's go.
now, if you weren't a wee little bit in love with her,
I might lose a little faith in you.
were you? - Little bit.
well, whatever. It's over now.
why'd you let him hit me?
because he hits harder than I do.
well, a quick glance at the test results tells me if was definitely another heart attack, ken.
how you gutted through it, as you said, I have no idea.
strong like bull. - Well, not anymore, you're not.
there's severe tissue damage here.
your heart is working at maybe 50% capacity.
Yeah, but isn't there some kind of surgery you can do?
no.
no. The damage is so extreme that
so why don't you just say it? I'm a dead man.
no, but you're gonna have to give up working.
no. No. I don't think so.
you're gonna have trouble getting up a flight of stairs, ken.
flight of stairs and smoke with 50 pounds of gear on your back, you're in trouble.
now, i've been your personal physician for 20 years.
in that time, i've seen you here a total of 3 times.
you go back to work, there may not be a fourth.
call the department tomorrow. Tell them to start sending the pension checks, right?
saving that baby, it was like
man, it was wild.
I mean, I can't imagine any other job being as rewarding as this, you know?
Yeah. I know, but you got to ask yourself this.
are you any less afraid now than when you started?
no, but I know that tommy and the guys have my back, so, you know, that makes it a little easier.
what out when tommy is not here anymore? - What do you mean?
the guy is one in a million, damian, but-- let's face it-- he's on borrowed time.
what about the day comes he's not here to hold your hand anymore? Then what?
Yeah. Well, I think tommy is gonna be around for a long time, mick. I mean, he just quit drinking and smoking.
all right. 2 out of 3 ain't bad.
what are you talking about?
danger. Danger is his main addiction.
let me ask you, you in love with the job?
Yeah. - You don't sound so certain.
no. I like it, all right? I like it a lot.
like is not good enough. - Ok. I love it.
how much? - I don't know. This much.
wise guy.
you love it as much as you love pussy? - No.
I mean, come on. Who does? - Tommy. Tommy gavin does.
you put tommy gavin in a room with jennifer lopez.
she's buck naked, raring to go. He's gonna lose interest after a while.
you light that same room on fire, whoa, he's gonna have a hard-on the size of the empire state building.
you, you're gonna be very, very afraid.
of the fire or j. Lo? - Probably both.
Yeah. I don't know about quitting, uncle mick.
I mean, tommy once said that firefighting isn't just a job.
it's a calling, and I believe that. I believe it's my calling.
Yeah. I had a calling.
you want to know from who? From god, or so I thought.
20 years of my life I spent chasing the cross.
the whole time, I knew I was on the wrong side of the altar.
Why? - Pussy.
I couldn't get my mind off of it.
I'd be saying mass. I'm checking out the hot chicks in the first 5, 10 pews.
I was serving up communion to these hot moms on their knees at the altar.
you know, I'm having some very unholy thoughts at the time, and then I realized I didn't have a calling, ok?
God didn't come down and talk to me and tell me to join up.
you want to know who it was?
it was my mother and tommy's mother and my aunts and my granddads.
they all wanted one of the gavin boys to be a priest, and guess who bought into that dream. Me, two decades of my life.
do yourself a favor, all right, damian? Get out while the getting is good.
meet a broad. Bang your brains out. Have a couple of kids.
here's an idea.
get a job where you know almost for a fact you're gonna come home at night.
I know tommy fills your head with ideas about what your father wanted for you, ok, but I knew your father, too.
he told me he wanted more for you-- college, cash.
that's why he worked so hard, to give you a leg up.
wait. He said that? - Many, many times.
so wait. So uncle tommy was lying when he said that my dad wanted me to be a firefighter?
let's just say, uncle tommy hears what uncle tommy wants to hear, ok?
the whole firefighting thing, that was just a backup plan in case you didn't want to do anything else or you were too stupid to do something else.
you can listen to me and take my advice, or you can wait 20 years, but the only thing is, in your line of work, there's no guarantee you're gonna be here in two days from now, let alone two decades.
why didn't you go to needles first? - Well, I figured he'd talk me out of it.
you figured wrong, kid.
I mean, you want to get out, fine.
it's your decision.
I've been on this job long enough to know that youth is definitely wasted on the young-- young, dumb, and full of come
but part of my job is to make sure that guys like you-- young, dumb come-runners
don't make so rash a decision that it'll haunt you later on.
right. Well, you know, i've put a lot of thought into it.
Yeah. Well, I'm sure you did put a lot of thought into this.
you got a prime job on a prime crew in a prime house.
let's say you give that up, hmm? Then what happens?
you change your mind in the next week, next month, the next year, there's no sure luck that this job is still gonna be here.
then what happens, huh?
you're in a shitty house on a half-ass crew, or, worse than that, you wind up back on the waiting list.
then you're jumping through golden goddamn hula hoops in some boring office job because that's what we're talking about here. Those are real possibilities.
I understand.
you're not doing this because I came down so hard on you the other day, are you?
no. No. I just-- I mean, to be honest,
I don't know if I'm really cut out for this, you know?
now that I'm here doing it on a day-to-day basis, it's like
I don't know. I mean, what do you think?
am I gonna get less scared and more courageous as time goes by?
let me put it to you this way.
one time back in 'nam, a buddy of mine, we were in a ditch.
he's a great guy-- jimmy bronstein, nice jewish kid. We got, you know, kind of friendly.
anyway, we're in this ditch looking over the edge. There's 4 or 5 guys behind us.
suddenly, jimmy hollers, "grenade!
and I turn around, and he's diving on this live grenade to protect us and me, hmm?
could you do that, you know, for the guys on your crew, for some homeless junkie in a fire, give up your life to save them?
because that's what this job is all about.
I know. That's
that's kind of what I'm worried about.
I'll, uh...
look. I'll put your papers in.
may take a couple of weeks.
meanwhile, get a hold of somebody to cover for you on the next couple of tours.
I don't want a guy whose heart is not in it riding around on the rig, - ok? - Ok. Thanks.
Hey, wait. So that bronstein guy.
so he must've gotten blown into a million bits, huh?
no. Damn thing never even went off. It was a dud.
point is, he jumped on that thing expecting to die.
came home a little bit after me, got a job as a fireman out in the midwest back in '77, won a medal for saving a homeless couple in a warehouse fire.
they lived. He didn't.
that's the point.
what do you want? - That's a hell of a way to answer the phone.
what do you want?
I talked to needles. I heard about the damian thing, and
if you try to change his mind or you make one move to keep him there,
I swear to christ I'm gonna take both your balls and put them in a goddamn vise.
think we tried that once, and I think I kind of remember liking it.
did you hear what I said? - Yeah, ok?
I was calling to congratulate you.
liar. - Listen.
I know I promised to take care of that, and I know I didn't, so I apologize for that.
apology accepted. What gives? - What? I just called to, you know
no. No. You can't.
neither one of us can just call each other without an ulterior motive.
I mean, that was the basis of our relationship, right
lies and manipulation and sex with a side order of angry threats and physical danger. So - what are you looking for from me? - I, you know
I'm aware of the fact that I made a couple of promises that I didn't necessarily keep and that I sometimes also took advantage of us, and I guess I'm calling to make amends for that.
did you ever love me, I mean, like, really love me?
Yes. Of course. Yeah.
just not enough, I guess.
we both know that we were, you know, haunted by jimmy and janet, and, you know, we both know all those times, half the time, I wanted to strangle her, and the other half, I don't think it's any big headline that, you know,
I was still kind of in love with her. So
I guess that's the half that won out.
lovehate. - Yeah, lovehate.
Yeah. That's how I feel about you.
5050? - Nah.
one half won out over the other. - Let me guess.
you hate me. - I hate you.
don't call me anymore. - Come on.
you know I'm gonna call you. - I don't accept your amends.
I don't grant you absolution, and I do not forgive you.
I want you to go away forever.
goddamn broads. Jesus.
Hi. This is sheila. You know what to do.
Hey. - Hey.
what's going on? - Not much.
it was a long day for you, huh? - Yeah.
traffic on the bridge was a bitch.
um, where is everybody?
well, the baby is asleep, and katy and colleen have gone to shawn's.
so we have the place to ourselves.
why did you love to drink so much?
what? - I'm not trying to pick a fight.
I just want to know the real reasons - why, ok, no bullshit. - I liked it.
you know, it was, I liked it.
OK. No. That's not good enough, ok, and don't say it's a disease because that just would qualify as bullshit right now.
no. Please just help me to understand why you preferred it to me and to the kids.
it is a disease.
I don't know. I mean, I just did.
I don't drink anymore, so-- - how did it make you feel?
it made me feel better. - How specifically?
because when things were shitty, I could have 5 or 6 or 10 vodkas or whiskeys, whatever, and, you know, I felt like
I was right and you were wrong. Everybody else was wrong, you know?
it made me feel, like-- I don't know-- great.
well, anyways, those days are over, and thank god, right?
you can have either or both, one last round, and I will never tell a soul.
middleton special reserve, which I know you love, and this is a nice glass of vodka called 42below, distilled 5 times. So it's up to you.
what's up to me?
a sip each, a glass, both glasses, ok? It's the last call, tommy, and no one will know.
all right. What's the
what's the deal? - There's no deal.
I tell you what. I will even drink one of those, and then you drink the other.
Oh, come on. It'll be like old times.
we have a couple of cocktails, and then we get it on.
so we're gonna have this. - And then we have that.
OK. - So which one do you want?
this has always been my favorite, and this is the best whiskey I ever had.
it's like brown velvet.
I mean, look at that... - It's beautiful.
but I know you're not gonna finish all of that, I'm assuming.
it's probably better if we're both on the same page if we're gonna do this, right?
all right. So what's it gonna be?
I will go...
what do you think of that?
I needed to know.
Yeah. It's not-- I wouldn't have.
look, tommy.
there are no explanations or apologizes needed from either one of us, ok, and if you want to make amends to other people, that's fine, but as far as I'm concerned, that was my final test.
so from now on, a fresh start, ok?
no booze, no grudges, and no sheila.
right. Right. Got it.
and there is one more thing.
Damian is not your actual son. He's your godson...
I know. Ok, so if you want to make amends with someone, start with katy
she's almost out the door
and then wyatt, ok, because you're working with a clean slate.
we were thinking, like, a bike or a jogging path in pat's name or, you know, something, like, in a park or something.
yo, thinking small potatoes, son.
you want to pay tribute to the man, you got to think big potatoes, mike, you know?
like, get him a tunnel, you know, or a highway in his name, you know
pat mahoney bridge. Now, that shit sings, man.
eh, that's a bad idea, son. You don't want nothing to do with transportation.
trust me on that. You know, people will be in their cars cursing the guy's name.
traffic on the goddamn patrick mahoney is a bitch.
like, you know, when they changed the triborough to the rfk bridge,
I mean, I swear to god they might as well have just dug the man up and shot him again.
Yeah. - Hit me. Thanks.
you know, mike, I hate to say it, man, but, you know, not every guy who meets an untimely end on his gig gets a public dedication, bro.
Yeah, but if we get something dedicated with his name on it, it makes a statement to the fdny and the public and maybe helps the government get its head out of its ass so it coughs up the cheese to help treat first responders, guys.
well, mikey, you know me, man. I'm all over that, and I applaud your intentions, but, I mean, how you exactly think you're gonna pull this off?
you and gary ain't really a brain trust, if you know what I'm saying.
well, pat's mom, she works for the parks and recreations department, and she happens to think she can help us swing it, dudes.
OK. Better to know someone than something, I guess.
gentlemens, have you perchance saved me any hot water?
yo, hef, what's up with the robe, man?
what? What are you talking about, this old thing?
check it out, huh? Pretty sweet.
no man should ever wear a robe ever.
especially in the presence of other men. - How about in, like, a spa?
Yeah. A spa is all right, you know, because if you're in a spa, you're not really a man, anyway, so it's cool.
guys, it was getting a little drafty in here, all right?
I decided to take action. - You look like a mental patient, dude.
bro, it's freezing in here. How can you not feel that? I mean, look at you, black shawn.
you're nipples are popping out like a couple of frozen hershey kisses.
let's not talk about my nipples, all right? - It's not just your nipples.
it's you, too, frankie, and you. My god, look at those things.
you could carve your name in the mirror with those puppies.
we're all nipping, boys, like denise richards on an ice fishing trip without a sweater.
goddamn, garrity. - What?
our nipples might be popping, but your dick has disappeared into your body like a frightened, little turtle.
you know what? That's not funny. I just said it was cold.
it ain't that cold. - No. It ain't.
take it. Take it.
so that's where you keep that, huh?
Jesus, you're jumpy. - I didn't hear you coming.
stealth, baby, stealth.
so, what, you're not gonna say anything?
about what? - You didn't talk to feinberg?
Oh, yeah. No. Yeah. No. I talked to needles.
And? - What?
you know, it is what it is.
Jesus christ, look at this thing.
could be on its last legs.
you know they don't even make this model anymore?
22 years i've had this.
I remember the first year I was out with your old man and we got a call, jumped on the rig.
halfway there to the job, there's no helmet.
you know, I keep my helmet in the rig like I do now. I did it from the beginning.
thing ain't there, you know, so on the way back from that job, I'm thinking back.
OK. Where did I leave it?
I remember. I left it on the front bumper of the rig.
so that means it's on the block somewhere.
I go up and down the whole block, under every parked car.
I can't find it, you know? I'm freaking out, and I came back.
I actually got a magic marker and made leaflets and put them up in the neighborhood. You know what I mean? I offered a $100 reward.
so two days go by. Third day, homeless guy walks in with this in his hand.
I gave him the 100 bucks, and off we go.
lucky break. - No.
your old man found it on the bumper and had it the whole time. He was just
you know? I don't know. Made me laugh.
that's the shit I'm gonna miss when I finally do walk away, you know, the ball busting.
so what you're saying-- you're saying you want me to stay?
no, no, no. I'm not saying that. No.
I think i've gotten into enough trouble with this particular situation.
you know, it's up to you. Really is.
you know, I got to say, if I was your age coming in now with all the politically correct bullshit after 911
guys are worried about promotions and covering their ass and all the paperwork and extra rules and regulations-- I don't know, man.
when me and your old man came in, we fought fires, we saved people, and in between jobs, we just did basically whatever the hell we wanted to, you know?
that was it. That's gonna have to be your call.
I'll tell you one thing, though.
I got to take a huge shit.
what the hell? - Burn in hell, damian.
touch me where I stink.
when you saved me in the fire, I think I pissed my pants.
Oh, what? Welcome to the hero club, proboscis.
Yeah. It's real piss. - Oh...Dude
Hey. - What's up, kid?
so I had a change of heart. - What do you mean?
about my papers, about leaving.
leaving?
Yeah. You know, there was your whole grenade story and some other stuff.
anyway, I changed my mind. - Right.
wait. You didn't tell anybody yet, did you?
only me. Told you he'd be back.
listen, kid. This job is balls out or no balls at all, all right?
I get any sense you're not in that game,
I'm gonna pull you off that rig myself, you understand?
Yes. Balls to the wall. Got it.
now get out of here. - All right.
you still got his papers? - I'm sure I do.
forget where I put them.
where the hell did I put them, right over here?
I just-- wait, wait. Hold on a second.
they're right here. - Oh. Thanks.
you sure you're all right?
Yeah. Sure.
Hey, chief, you got a sec?
whenever you call me chief, it's always official house business, lou.
what's up? Is this about the kid? - What about the kid?
his toes are getting frosty. - He quit?
Nah. He'll be all right.
you know the new kids. First sign of trouble, their balls shrivel up.
he'll thicken up his hide. He'll be fine. What's up with you?
with what? - What'd you want to talk about?
nothing.
Hey, chief." what'd you want to talk to me about?
Oh, just gonna ask you about something.
Jesus christ, I had it top of my head, and I can't remember what I was gonna ask you.
sorry. I'll think of it.
there's something going around here.
all right, fellas. It looks like it's confined to the second floor, explosion number two.
Lou, pop the lock and run a sweep for me.
Frankie, you getting a saw? - Yeah.
Bobby, drop me a second line. Let's stay alert.
this is an abandoned warehouse we're dealing with.
do me a favor. Keep an eye on lou. - Why? What's wrong with lou?
he's acting funny. - Lou is a funny guy.
no, not ha-ha funny, weird funny. - All right.
Hey, kid, you with us? - 100%.
all right. Go get 'em.
holy jesus. - Jesus christ.
what is this place? - Goddamn coffin factory.
well, look at the bright side. If this fire goes to shit and we all die, they won't have to take us very far. Talk about a bad omen.
Yeah. - All right.
Frankie and mike, you guys go deep.
Tommy and damian, take the second floor.
Shawno, you and I vent up top. Come on.
you all right? Why don't you put your mask on?
I'm fine. Just do a sweep.
chief, we need water up here.
all the hydrants are frozen, lou. We're going to plan "b.
what's plan "b"?
we're still figuring that out.
well, hurry up. Things are getting ugly.
Hey, are you ok? Lou.
shut up, will you, and do your search.
Oh, god. Oh, goddamn it.
Lou, hey, come on. I'm getting worried. Lou.
Lou, what are you doing?
Hey, hey, hey, ken, what are you doing? You can't vent without a hose. Lou!
I can't goddamn breathe.
Lou, I told you not to vent. We got no goddamn water down here.
Shawn, call in a second alarm. We're losing this.
son of a bitch. Bobby, go find me another hydrant.
let's get the hell out of here. - Yeah. Just go. Go, go, go, go.
Tommy, we're hot up here on 3, no bodies. You have anything down there?
all clear up here. What's the story with the water?
we ain't waiting anymore.
you and damian go down the stairs. Meet us on the ground floor.
all right.
let's go.
trying to find an exit, chief. - Lou, the rear is all sealed.
I got a ladder on the roof, but it doesn't look like you guys have access anymore.
you're gonna have to come out the same way you went in.
that's a hot gauntlet to run. - We got no choice.
I'm gonna give you all the water I can.
keep your heads down, double-time it, and get your asses out here.
don't make me wait. - Ok. Lace them up, boys.
it's "logan's run" time. Franco, you go first.
stick together, guys. Keep your heads down.
what?
guys, come on. Get out of here.
what? - You get out of here.
guys, now pick that up.
Mayday! Mayday! 62 truck to battalion 30. we got a guy trapped.
we got to go! Come on!
come on. - We got to go!
come on, guys! We got to go!
your heart's working at maybe 50% capacity.
so why don't you just say it? I'm a dead man.
no, but you're gonna have to give up working.
I'm with Mickey now.
and he is this close to getting Damian to change his mind about his life path.
we were thinking like a bike or a jogging path in pat's name.
not every guy who meets an untimely end on his gig gets a public dedication, bro.
I don't accept your amends, and I do not forgive you.
I want you to stay away from me forever.
so, from now on, fresh start.
no booze, no grudges, and no Sheila.
get a job where you know almost for a fact that you're gonna come home at night.
in your line of work, there's no guarantee you're gonna be here in 2 days from now.
I don't know if I'm really cut out for this.
I mean, you want to get out, it's your decision.
you're saying you want me to stay?
you know, it's up to you.
I had a change of heart.
told you he'd be back.
listen, kid, this job is balls out or no balls at all, all right?
Yes. Balls to the wall. Got it.
all right, go get 'em.
come on! come on, guys, we gotta go!
I know, Dr. Klein, I know.
but there's a huge canyon between knowing something and accepting it.
you know, it's like as a living, breathing human person,
I know what reality is.
but as a mother...
as a mother, I think that...
I still think I see him walking around...
you know, in the neighborhood or at the store.
I even sometimes think that I hear him moving around the apartment.
I know.
I know, but I am getting better.
I'm keeping myself very busy.
so...
how am I doing on the blame?
Ah, I still blame myself...
and him.
mostly him.
no, no, no, no, I'm kidding.
I'm joking.
listen, is it cold outside?
like, did you have to wear a coat, or do I need a coat and a sweater -
no.
Dr. Klein, I'm not avoiding the issue.
Damian chose to ride the truck that night.
he chose to join the fire department.
so if I was gonna blame anybody,
I'd blame that stupid baby that he saved the week before the accident.
saving that baby is what sent him over the moon about the job, so...
no.
I do not-- I do not blame anybody.
right?
I gotta go.
Yeah, ok, ok, ok.
what is the-- What's the mantra for the day?
it's not my fault.
it's not my fault.
it's not my fault.
Ah, I can't believe how well that works sometimes.
I know, yes.
Yes, same time tomorrow.
Dr. Klein, thank you so much for doing these phone sessions with me.
you're really, like-- You're really saving my life.
Yes.
OK.
OK, bye.
hello.
sorry I'm late.
traffic was a bitch.
I could have walked here faster.
Hey, how was your, uh...
phone thing?
OK, you have got to stop...
beating yourself up about this.
Jesus Christ, it's not your fault.
I know, I know, I know.
OK, listen, I got you...
OK?
it's not your fault.
overcoming the blame game and getting your life back on track.
what, stupid? I knew it. I shouldn't have.
no. You went to a bookstore?
what, it's impossible for me to go into a book -
you know, I read a lot of books.
about baseball.
no, no.
not just baseball.
golf.
don't even play golf. Never played golf.
I've read, like, 6 books about the Kennedys.
I read that giant Mickey Mantle biography, which doesn't count as a baseball book because it was mostly about drinking.
OK, all right.
I'm sorry.
it was very nice of you to get it for me.
it was actually in the magazine aisle at the supermarket, but I think it's a pretty important book.
it's got a quote from Dr. Oz on it, and I think he's on "Oprah," right?
Yes, he is on "Oprah.
OK.
so-- and I got the chicken we were talking about, ok?
and I got the protein powder that Franco was telling me about.
cause the protein thing's working, right? The diet?
you know, I've been so frazzled, it's hard for me to tell, but I have got to get going because I really, really, really want to catch that specialist.
Hey, but I really-- I want you to read this book.
I will.
I promise you I'm gonna read that book.
all right.
has anybody heard from Mickey?
Teddy said he saw him at a meeting, which means, you know, he's not drinking.
couldn't happen to a nicer douchebag.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Hey.
handsome.
I'm gonna go see a man about a drug that's gonna help you walk again.
uncle tommy's right over there, ok?
all right, pal.
I'm gonna make your favorite chicken tuna thing.
gentlemen, I got the official word.
you're a moron.
gonna ignore that.
why, because you can't think of a good comeback?
Oh, no, my friend, I got a good comeback.
let's hear it.
well, no, it's too late now.
Oh, by all means, let me cue you again.
you're a moron.
anyhow...
listen.
the official word is this.
tomorrow, central park will be the official unveiling of the Patrick James Mahoney memorial pavilion.
sweet.
pat's mom-- she wants, like, a sunset ceremony, so I thought we'd head over there after work, you know, show a sign of support.
Yeah. Shit, yeah.
hell, I hope I get a pavilion when I burn up.
a pavilion's the shit, man.
a pavilion. What is a pavilion?
I think it's some kind of building.
no, no, no.
I think it's sort of like a plaza, an open-air walkway kind of thing, you know?
Nah, it's a building.
fancy, big windows.
well, I'm glad you guys are as confused as I am.
cause when I first heard it, I thought it was like a big number.
you know, after a jillion comes a pavilion.
and with that, we have looped all the way back to "you're a moron.
first of all, young Einstein, there's no such thing as a jillion.
not true.
I went to high school with a girl named Jillian.
nasty.
let you feel her up, blow your socks off, just for a can of coke.
geez, imagine what you can get for a 12-can refrigerator pack.
or if you had a pavilion cans.
imagine that.
that's so many cans.
OK, why are we talking about pavilions?
well, because tomorrow after work, Pat Mahoney is getting a pavilion named for him in central park.
we're all going down.
count me in.
Oh, and by the way, I think that we should bring Damian with us.
you think?
Yeah, but the kid's in a chair, Sean-- like fresh in a chair.
but he's been in the house, what, 2 months now?
what tommy's been saying, Sheila's been on the kid day and night.
although, I gotta tell you,
I don't know how she's gonna feel about having this motley crew rolling her not-so- Bouncing baby boy into the middle of goddamn central park.
come on, Lou, what could go wrong?
well, I mean, first thing, the kid's sitting there like a statue.
pigeons.
Oh, man!
what?
serious.
this is about not forgetting our heroes.
I mean, Damian's the hero as much as the next guy.
is he not?
right.
I mean, we want to forget him? Come on.
maybe you're not such a moron.
no, no, no, he's a moron, but he makes a good point.
Hey, guys.
unbelievable.
pat's memorial?
tomorrow. I heard.
you guys are not gonna guess who I saw.
you'll never guess in a million years.
how about a pavilion years?
you beat me to it.
Mikey, who?
OK, so I go to this little bodega, right?
and it's a bodega that I don't actually usually go to, but I went today.
spit it out, Mikey. get on with it.
and I'm going down the aisle, and I'm thinking about what I'm gonna get
Oh, my god.
what's with all the buildup, bro?
Jesus! what, dude?
I'm-- with a buildup like this, you better be telling us you saw Angelina Jolie doing a 1-handed handstand in a short skirt and no panties.
I saw Mickey.
Oh, shit, Mikey.
Where's tommy?
he's gonna want to hear this.
he was in the bunk room last time I saw.
you sure it was him?
Yeah.
I mean, like, you talked to the guy?
Yes.
what did he say?
Hi, mike.
where was this?
like, 2 blocks away, Lou.
guy's got some set of balls, showing his face in this neighborhood again.
Yeah, guy's got some set of balls doing what he did in the first place, you know?
Hey, Lou.
somebody's here to see you.
maybe it's Mick.
he ain't got balls that big.
this guy says he's your doctor?
last time you were in my office, didn't we talk about you retiring?
look, um, we just lost a guy on our crew-- a young kid.
so right now, it's kind of all hands on deck, if you know what I mean.
for me to just walk away
Yeah, or crawl away, which is more likely.
look, maybe a couple months.
you know, I don't know.
you think I don't know what you're up to?
you have a department physical coming up, right?
a physical you are guaranteed not to pass.
and you want me to get you off the hook, give you a clean bill of health, lie to the F.D.N.Y.
so you good with that?
Oh, Christ.
this is all I know how to do, doc.
I don't fish.
I don't golf.
I fight fires.
and I eat cake.
so you take away the fires, and I promise you, 3 weeks, a month, tops,
I will be dead due to cake-related injuries.
can you live with that?
if I lie for you and you die in a fire and some or all of your beloved crew dies trying to save you, can you live with that?
enjoy your cake.
dad.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
can you help me with my essay?
uh, sure, honey, just give me 2 seconds. I just want to
Yeah, well, mom said you knew a lot about the Vietnam war, and that's what it's on and it's due tomorrow.
expert on the Vietnam war.
2 seconds. Ok?
Hey!
you missed the meeting.
last night, you said you'd take me to the S.T. Celia Tuesday night aa meeting?
and I waited, and now it's too late.
Oh, shit!
I totally forgot.
Really?
I never would have guessed.
Oh, boy.
she's pissed, huh?
yeah?
well, we're all pissed, except for Wyatt, and that's only because he's a baby.
although I'm sure his little sponge brain is already soaking up the disappointment, broken promises, and general a. d. Malaise that is Tommy Gavin.
what's that supposed to mean?
dad.
Yeah.
Vietnam?
2 minutes, honey. Ok?
what? What is that-- What was that thing you said?
the malaise?
Oh, that's just a fancy-ass way of saying bullshit.
OK, no. The other thing.
A. dd. You, tommy, have emotional a. dd.
OK, you keep promising the world to your children and to your wife, and then you spend half of your waking hours spoon-feeding your brain-damaged godson and giving emotional support to your ex-girlfriend.
I mean, you missed 3 dinners this week.
and right now, you were supposed to be at the S.T. Celia cyc aa.
OK, not to mention the F.D.N.Y. thing, the p.a.l. thing , and the p.t.a. thing-- all of which you missed last week.
Tommy, you promised me that you would be focused here at home on us.
but no, you are so busy trying to save the goddamn world, rescuing people from fires, from cars, Sheila, Damian, every other goddamn soul on this planet, except your own goddamn family.
I mean, it's like you have O.C.D., except instead of germs, you're obsessed with saving strangers.
you know, when it comes to Sheila-- have you thought about ptsd when it comes to her?
honey, I told you, I got tested.
she got tested-- PSTD-- post-traumatic stress disorder, Tommy.
and thank you for that visual.
OK.
I don't know. Maybe I do have a. d.
and cbs and nhl, the lpa.
I don't know. Maybe I do have a. d.
x you know, with one family.
no.
with 2 families.
OK.
2 families.
you know...
OK, has Mickey resurfaced yet?
a couple of the guys saw him, but he's not helping out.
he's not involved.
he doesn't know...
OK, so Damian and your girlfriend are now your responsibility.
Jesus Christ.
it's not my girlfriend.
this is not a girlfriend thing.
this is a family thing.
listen, if I'd never slept with her and this had happened to Damian, wouldn't you expect me to be doing exactly what I'm doing just for jimmy's sake?
Yes, yes.
OK, see?
Yes, but you did sleep with her, and that is the difference.
look, katy has a dance recital tomorrow night, and colleen has her 50th meeting in 50 days.
you need to be there for both.
OK.
Jesus Christ.
dad.
vietnam, right.
what have you got so far?
OK, I have that once we got in, we couldn't get out.
and both sides dug their heels in and neither one would let up any ground.
and that's basically the main idea, right?
don't I know it.
what?
we're talking American history here.
so you're gonna be with him at this pavilion Hoosie-whatsie, right?
Yeah.
OK.
then I shouldn't worry.
I mean, I would go.
it's just that I really want to catch this specialist, you know.
it's like he's only here one week out of every year.
Yeah.
listen, it'll do him some good to be out of the house.
you know what I mean?
Yes.
besides, you know what, you've gotta drive the van.
it's not that I don't trust the guys.
I guarantee you that. Ok?
so this specialist, he has got a clinic in Zurich.
and he is into this whole alternative form of therapy.
and it's wicked expensive, but he says that the proteins are great.
he just wants to add some Injectible steroids and then a series of blood supplements.
and it's 25 grand a month.
but he has got a patient in Sweden who's getting the circulation feeling back in his legs.
Yeah, 'cause he's sitting on an empty wallet.
25 grand.
a lot of money.
I don't care what it costs.
no, I know. I know.
I want Damian to walk again.
right. Right.
Hey, you're reading... This, huh?
what? Oh, yeah. I have.
you know, I really love those self-help books.
I feel like no matter what they have to offer, with, like, either, you know, weight or quit smoking or grief, they do have something to offer that's worth it.
and I think that's why they sell so well.
Yeah. To chicks.
you've never read a self-help book?
I read "how to throw a football" by Johnny Unitas when I was, like, 12.
and then again when I was, like, 35
when Damian and I joined that flag football league.
Jimmy used to call it "fag football" league.
it was pretty faggy, which is why
I threw, like, 48 touchdown passes when I was playing quarterback that year.
listen, I really appreciate what you've been doing, you know, for the both of us.
don't mention it.
don't-- You don't have to say anything about that.
Jimmy's definitely looking down and he sees what a good man and friend -
best friend -
you don't have to say it.
you are being, unlike Mickey.
douchebag.
what did he say, exactly?
he said some very hurtful things.
he couldn't handle it.
no. You know what, just don't get me started, all right?
what I want to say is that I really those things I said to you about hating you, I just was
no, no, no, no, listen.
forget about that.
I know.
you don't hate me. You don't blame me.
I blame myself.
no, you shouldn't.
it was me.
I was the one that talked him into being a firefighter.
did he want to do it, yeah.
but you know, I pushed him in that direction, you know, so...
Yes, but I should have done more of the, like, reverse psychology thing and kept telling him that I wanted him to be a firefighter.
the reverse psychology thing is ridiculous.
that was never gonna work, no.
it was-- you know, he wanted to go back on the rig, but I urged him.
I shouldn't have done it, you know.
Yeah, and you shouldn't have shown him his father's badge.
are you talking about the badge that you gave me specifically to save and keep for him?
the one to keep the hell out of my house? Yes.
the house you suffocated him in.
what is it, honey?
are you ok?
give him a drink.
here, here.
see if you can get it, Damian.
come on.
Yeah, a little more.
look at that.
goddamn Mickey.
rat bastard.
you want to blame somebody-- He's the guy to point the finger at.
scumbag.
hello.
I'm gonna start drinking again.
Coll, where are you?
Hey.
you didn't start drinking again, did you?
not yet.
good.
thank god. look at this cart.
I mean, this would only work for our family if we were midgets.
Yeah, or normal.
what's the story?
I'm just picking out all my old favorites.
Oh, this is my favorite.
Oh, my gosh.
it goes down so clean and smooth.
but I don't have to tell you that.
Hello, you.
Oh, you and I were best friends once.
good-bye.
don't kiss the bottle.
goddamn, what's up?
here's the deal.
you were supposed to be my sponsor, which was a stupid idea to begin with and even more idiotic now that I realize that in trying to do 90 meetings in 90 days, out of the 49 I've hit so far, you've only been with me for 10 of them.
no. One-zero.
OK, and every time I try to call you to talk about booze or an urge to drink or something about recovery that I desperately need to know, you not only don't pick up, you don't even call me back or text me.
honey, I can't text.
my fingers are too big.
I tried typing in "what's going on,
and it sends out a text saying "who's blowing Juan?
I can't do it.
here's the thing. I don't even want to drink this stuff right now.
that's good, honey.
I just wanted to see how fast you'd get down here if I lit a fire under your ass.
you know I have a lot of stuff going on, ok?
I'm trying to juggle everything at work and at home.
meaning Damian.
he's crippled.
so am I, by a disease I inherited from you!
my 50th meeting is tonight. Ok?
and I'd really like my sponsor to be there. On time!
Hey, sorry, man.
I got so much-- - been here about 20 minutes.
Hi, tom.
can you guys give tom and me a minute or two here, please?
sure, yeah, no problem.
I brought these for you.
cam Neely's greatest hockey hits..."
and "friends of eddie coyle.
I should have gotten them back to you a long time ago, you know.
I know how crazy you are about your Robert Mitchum collection.
And?
that's it? He's leaving?
Oh, I had a sawbuck on him kicking your ass.
go back into the kitchen.
you got something you want to say to me, tough guy?
get in there!
you heard me! Get the hell back in there!
all right.
we can stand here all morning knocking the snot out of each other, or you can shut your goddamn yap for 2 seconds and listen to what I gotta say.
unless you're gonna say you're a gutless, spineless, no balls pussy, I don't want to hear it.
I'd rather just keep doing this.
at least I get some satisfaction out of it.
all right.
is that what you want to hear?
all right.
I'm a no-good, gutless, spineless pussy, ok, who abandoned his girlfriend and a paralyzed kid because I'm just a self-centered goddamn asshole!
does that about cover it?
did you guys hear that?
actually, that last part was a little garbled.
the trouble is, fellas, we only bet the physical confrontation, so there's some money kind of hanging in the balance.
come here.
I want you guys to hear this.
you want to know why I left Sheila?
it's not because I'm a coward or I'm a pussy or I suck like this guy's telling you.
it's because I couldn't take it anymore.
all right, she's wasting her whole life, all her energy, her time, her money, her hope on a string of quacks!
endless.
pills, protein powders, injections, aqua acupuncture.
what is that? I don't know.
she's going for every bit of it hook, line, and sinker.
so I try to tell her.
you know, I was just trying to tell her the truth -
what this guy should be telling her and everybody else, which is Damian ain't ever walking again.
he is as is.
done.
so she told me to take a hike.
I didn't come down here to tell you guys that it took a lot of balls to tell her that -
the truth.
but I'm here to say it took a little bit of balls.
and if any of you had any, you'd tell her the same thing...soon.
be safe.
well, always good to see Mick.
it's a shitter.
what? What are you talking about?
the Patrick James Mahoney memorial pavilion is a pumping station.
in other words-- a crapper?
how the hell did this happen?
didn't start yet, right?
sorry.
couldn't get the ramp back in the van.
the van cost an arm and a leg.
you'd think it would have an automatic ramp...
what's wrong?
well, they decided to honor Patrick James Mahoney, our fallen brother -
a hero.
with a shit pavilion.
I don't know. Looks pretty good to me.
not in form, in function.
they got his name on a plaque.
go ahead.
go look behind that blue curtain.
it's a crapatorium, Tom.
a turd temple.
a boo-boo barn.
a fudge hole.
Yeah, you know, we need a guy in a suit right now.
excuse me, sir?
Yeah, can I help you?
Yeah, we're F.D.N.Y.
listen, we're just trying to figure out why the city decided to honor our brother with a restroom.
Yeah, the guy gets cancer working down at ground zero, and you guys think that this is a -
that this is-- fits?
that this is...
appropriate?
no. That ain't it, dude.
are any of you members of the Mahoney family?
not technically, no, but, Jesus-- - look, the family was given a list of possible naming options.
this is the one they chose.
they wanted a central park pavilion.
well, were they made aware the pavilion in this case means outhouse?
look, guys, your friend is being honored here today, whether you believe it or not.
just go with the flow.
Hey, problem is, the flow is full of feces, pal.
you know, this is a slap in the goddamn face is what it is.
pat Mahoney was no different than the men who died when those towers came down.
he's dead because he was working such long hours on that cancerous pile of shit.
so, what, you didn't have a urinal to offer the guy?
something smaller, more insignificant?
you want to make a scene, tough guys?
would that make you happy? - thanks for nothing, pal.
we appreciate it. - thanks, buddy.
have a good day, asshole. - what a dick.
what's going on? What's the ruckus?
Hey, where the hell you been?
I had a long walk from the car.
I had to take a leak.
well, you didn't do it in there, did you?
what? What?
no, I whipped my dick out in front of the crowd and did a little pissing dance.
what are you talking about?
Lou, you just took a leak in pat's pavilion.
no, I took a leak at pat's pavilion.
no, dude, in.
pat Mahoney's pavilion is a public shitter.
you're kidding me.
Nah.
Jesus Christ.
I thought the pavilion was this whole kind of area out here, therefore, the shitter was pavilion-adjacent.
Oh, Christ.
I gotta talk to the family.
the family doesn't need to know.
no, I really gotta talk to them.
in other words...
you didn't-- don't tell me that you-- oh, Jesus.
Lou dropped the deuce in pat's memorial.
come on, Lou!
guys, I had a huge lunch, and it had to be tacos.
you know, I gotta get out of here.
Why? Where you going?
I'm not gonna stand here and watch a good man be insulted this way.
franc, I'm sorry, it was tacos.
it wasn't me.
no, I'm not talking about you, Lou.
I refuse to believe that a man gives his life doing his job, doing it well, and this is the way he's remembered.
you know, it ain't right.
pat deserves better, much better.
you know what, you're right.
he does.
how do you mean?
all right, I tell you what.
here, take my keys.
you and Mikey go to my car.
in the back, in the trunk there's a toolbox.
get it, bring it over here, pronto.
I like the sound of that.
Yeah, yeah, you know what? It sounds great.
pulling it off is not gonna be so easy.
where are you?
the meeting's in 15 minutes.
I'm at an F.D.N.Y. thing in the middle of central park.
you know what, just forget it.
are you home?
no, I'm at the church.
and mom is home waiting for you to pick her up at the house for katy's dancing.
which is when?
you've got to be at the school in an hour and a half.
well, you know what, maybe i'll swing by the meeting on my way over to the -
you know what?
don't sweat it.
I've already found another sponsor.
who?
me, asshole!
you might have backpacked her back into sobriety, but I'll be in charge of her confirmation.
now get your no-good ass home and take my other favorite niece to her dance bullshit!
now!
Hey, I gotta take off.
here's the keys to the van.
I need you to watch it and Damian, ok?
I'm gonna get your keys from the morons, and I'm gonna borrow your car, all right?
all right, all right.
and after we're done here, I'll bring him home.
no, no.
I gotta take him home.
OK, so, I'll call and check in with you later to find out where you are, come pick him up.
what am I supposed to do with him?
I don't know.
take him dancing.
and so, it's with great pride and with the great appreciation of the city of New York for his many years of service that we dedicate the Patrick James Mahoney pavilion.
Yes.
now, this-- this is a goddamn pavilion.
you gonna take a shit here, too?
Yeah, this looks good, Lou.
but you know it ain't gonna last.
they're gonna take this down, bro.
I'd like to see 'em try.
I used my homemade ninja glue to put this thing up.
they want to take it down, they're gonna have to knock the whole goddamn wall down.
Yeah, well, apparently you never heard that old saying "you can't beat city hall.
what's the point of doing this if nobody knows it's here?
Hey, we know it's here.
and Pat knows, wherever he is.
it's good enough for me.
guys!
I think security's coming!
all right, gentlemen, let's celebrate.
Yeah.
Where's my son?
what?
I come home, and my son is nowhere to be found.
how long was the thing in the park?
just got out. Just got out.
so then, you're on your way home?
Yeah, yeah, but there's a shitload of traffic so it's gonna take a while.
OK, well, listen...
there's this, like, seminar thing where this expert is gonna talk about paralysis and regenerative movement, and I really, really want to go.
you go.
you need to go to that.
thank you.
let me say hi to Damian.
well, the thing is, I'm driving, so it's not -
it's against the law now to talk on a cell phone while you're driving.
I shouldn't be talking to you right now.
I would like him to hear my voice.
all right, here you go.
here he is.
Hey, sweetie!
did you have fun with the guys in the park?
did you miss your old ma?
happy now?
I think he answered me.
did you hear that?
he's never done that before.
that must be the protein.
I think that the protein's working.
do you think it's protein?
I wouldn't put too much on the protein.
look, there's a cop up ahead.
I gotta go. Ok?
Hey, shithead, where the hell are you?
well, Damian didn't want to go dancing, so we took him to the bar.
Oh, my god.
Jesus Christ!
Hey, just relax, will you?
we're not feeding him drinks.
we're feeding him beer nuts, and we're feeding him pretzels, but no drinks.
don't put anything in his mouth!
goddamn it!
all right, all right, hold on a second.
he's trying to-- He wants to tell you something.
spit it out, Damian.
uh, yeah, he says you're an asshole.
Yeah, you're a regular riot.
I'm gonna be there in 10 minutes, asshole.
you're looking good, buddy.
Ah, dame.
what do you think he's thinking, matt?
I don't know.
nothing?
or maybe he's having a great time.
how would you know?
Yeah, I don't know.
I just thought maybe one brain-damaged individual might give us some insight into the thoughts of another.
another what?
check, please!
guys, I'm sorry.
like, I don't mean to sound mean or insensitive or anything, but I think it's really weird that we have him hanging around like this.
what are you talking about? He's fine. He likes it.
is he ok?
well, actually, he's paralyzed, and he's got a little bit of brain damage, too.
that's so sad.
was he in a car accident or something?
no. He was a firefighter.
we're all firefighters.
he was on our crew.
it happened on a call, a big fire.
do you guys still hang out with him?
Yeah.
Oh, that's sweet.
Yeah, well, you know, hey, once a brother, always a brother, right?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.
I'm Franco, by the way.
this is Sean.
black Shawn here.
and this right here is Damey-Dame.
Damian, actually.
and this one-- whatever.
Hi, Mike.
so you guys take care of him and everything?
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, I feed him.
Oh, that's so great.
I'm gonna go outside and wait for tom...
and maybe puke.
I have to stay and see how low the crowded elevator's gonna go.
and you know, I dress him.
and I wash him, and I bathe him, as it were.
Seriously?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, most of him.
I do his torso, arms, legs, face.
try to avoid the groin.
that's a little gay.
we'll leave that to mike.
he's kidding.
so, you don't help take care of him?
Yeah, yeah, sure, I do.
what do you do?
uh, I change his diaper, actually.
so, ladies, you think we might be able to interest you in a couple of drinks over by the bar?
Yeah, yeah, I think we'd like that.
all right, I know we would.
it's just so nice to meet men that are so...
caring.
thanks for that, Shawn.
thank you, buddy. Thanks.
got it.
Yeah, nice work.
thank you.
so why don't you guys just go grab a couple of stools over there.
we'll be right over.
all right.
nice to meet you guys.
see you in a second. right.
fantastic.
Oh, my god. How easy was that?
what the hell was happening? I don't understand.
Jesus, we just made 3 chicks in under 45 seconds.
that's gotta be some kind of land pussy speed record or something, even for me.
you know what it is?
it's not us. It's him.
you know what, you're right, bro.
I mean, he is, without a doubt, the ultimate wingman.
you know, he attracts chicks.
he doesn't mess with your game.
he won't dominate the conversation, that's for sure, and he can't cock-block you.
it's unbelievable.
he's like a paralyzed pussy magnet.
you know what, I'm taking him with me on Saturday.
OK, all right, well, I want him on Friday, and I want Saturday next weekend.
no, no, we'll switch off every other weekend, back and forth.
you know what, that's perfect, bro.
guys, when do I get him?
why don't you go wash your hands, diaper boy?
that's bullshit.
if you guys are gonna-- that's enough!
I cannot believe you!
I'm just sitting over there listening to you balloon heads actually using our paralyzed probie for you guys picking up pussy.
you know, you're right.
sorry, chief.
Yeah, sorry. terrible, man.
shameless action.
but look at that pussy.
I know.
we don't want it getting cold. Let's go.
let's hurry. Go, go, go, go, go.
who are these guys?
I know.
you gotta start hanging out with a better class of people, kid.
Hey, what happened to your friend?
Ah, he got hurt.
he's a firefighter.
are you a firefighter?
I'm the chief.
what's your name?
