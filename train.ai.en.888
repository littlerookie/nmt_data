Mr. Monk, there's no traffic. There are no cars.
are you coming?
all right. You stay here. I'll be back.

I don't know.
that light is always breaking down.
I've called the traffic bureau about it twice.

Hey, don't tell me
little old lady Took you by the arm and helped you across the street.
well, she's not that little.
that's her over there.
that's Marge.
how perfect is that? - You know her?

they wish they didn't. She's here all the time complaing.
he does it every single night.
I mean, loud. You could hear it five blocks away.
Marge. We've warned him twice.
see, he's already been cited.
well, but what am i supposed to do?
I can't sleep. I can't read.
it never ends. - He has a court date.
november 17th.
if you can wait until then,
maybe the judge will issue an injunction.
Hi. Hi again.
it-it's Adrian Monk, remember me?
sure. - Yeah, what's going on?
disturbing the peace. It's no big deal.
well, it's a big deal to me.
you know, it's my peace he's disturbing.
Yeah, it's her peace.
it's a big deal to her. - Yeah.
we're talking about my next-Door neighbor, Mr.Keyes.
he bought a set of drums two weeks ago,
and i-I haven't slept in ten days.
I'm just desperate And i can't get anybody to do anything about it.
I was just explaing To ms. Johnson here that the department has other priorities.
well, maybe the department does, But i don't.
okay, if- If this happens again,
call the dispatcher And have him forward the call to me, adrian monk.
I'll take care of it.
Really?
sure.
thank you.
no, it
you are such a good boy.
Yeah, you are. I can tell by your eyes.
Yep. I can tell a lot of things about people.
I am- I am a good boy. - You are.
you want a piece of candy?
Yeah. No. I- I don't, uh
take it. - Okay.
excuse me.
is that absolutely necessary?
is what necessary? - Removing the body.
I'm miles franklin. I'm the curator here.
as you can see, This is a world-Record museum.
so i gathered.
there was already one victim on the swordfish.
that was already pretty impressive.
you understand, this is like a god send for us.
we pray for things like this.
sir, the- That's a human being.
he had a name. He had a family.
we pray for things like this.
this'll be bigger Than those twins on the motorcycles.
would you go stand over there, please?
what is that? Is that candy? Where did you get that?
a friend.
what friend?
I made a friend. It could happen.
it's that lady, isn't it?
that sweet old lady, Marge. She gave you candy!
that is so cute. You're eating her candy.
that's enough about the candy.
doesn't look like a robbery.
there was 250 bucks in the cash register. He didn't touch it.
what about the exhibits? Anything missing?
we haven't done a full inventory yet, But I haven't noticed anything.
Where's Togo?
Where's who?
togo the egg-Eating robot. He was right here.
he's right. I don't know how i missed that.
togo's been here for years.
it's a mechanical display.
good work, Randy. How did you know it was missing?
I come here every year on my birthday.
kind of like a family tradition.
when you were a kid.
you meant when you were a kid.
say, "yes," Randy.
Yes.
all right, so they broke in, They killed a security guard,
and stole an egg-Eating robot.
Yeah, could the machine possibly be involved?
What'd you say?
Well-Well, in science fiction, They sometimes come alive.
they become sentient.
well, if this were a movie, you'd believe me.
if this were a movie, i could walk out, randy.
what have you got? - Tire tracks.
that's hydraulic fluid. - Yeah.
togo was dripping.
get a sample of this.
well, we know we're looking for one guy.
how do you figure?
well, if it were two or more, They would have just carried it out.
this guy brought in a hand truck, And this sign looks like new
no nicks or scratches.
didn't you say This display has been here for years?
Oh, we had to replace that plaque.
about two months ago, Some nut from berkeley spray-Painted all over it.
he says that he broke the world record And it should be him in the museum.
a jealous egg-Eater.
God help us, we have a motive.
hello.
Yes. Yes, he is.
hold on one minute. Mr. Monk.
it's marge.
hello. - Adrian, this is Marge.
I'm sorry to bother you, honey,
but you-You did say i could call you anytime.
Marge, is that you? I can barely hear you.
that's him again!
that's my neighbor, I tell you.
I don't know what to do. He's just driving me crazy.
I am at my wit's end.
Yeah.
Hi.
I wonder if you could keep it down.
you're disturbing the neighbors.
I'm practicing.
I'm a musician.
I understand, but it's so loud.
and you've been playing all day
Really?
I get it.
the crone from next door sent you.
she's not a crone.
but what are you, Her favorite nephew?
look, you tell your auntie that i- I'm an artist and i'm expressing myself.
what, if-If picasso was living next door to her,
would she be complaing about him?
I'm not her nephew. I- I'm with the police.
more or less.
more or less?
Yeah.
okay.
okay what?
no, i was gonna take a break anyway.
okay, then.
okay.
well, have a nice...
quiet day.
he stopped? - Yeah.
what on earth did you say to him?
well, I told him you were a friend of mine
and, uh, he got the message.
just like that, huh?
well, I'm impressed.
you're a regular John Wayne.
except, you know, He needed a gun.
anyway, I'm glad I could help.
don't reckon he'll be bothering you again.
guess I'll have natalie pick me up.
Oh, where are you going?
I mean, I guess you have to go someplace.
not really.
good, good. Come on in, then.
Yeah, you just have to stay here And tell me all about it.
okay.
I bet you're hungry, right?
boys are always hungry.
did you have anything to eat today?
I-I had that peppermint you gave me.
that's not real food. I mean, food.
I- I don't want to impose.
I was just making lunch.
I love your house.
do you?
did you grow up in a place like this?
I-I grew up wishing it was a place like this.
is this you?
Yeah.
I always wanted to write a cookbook.
of course, I let it go till i was 65,
and then you know what my sister said?
she said, "You can't write a cookbook at 65."
besides, nobody cooks anymore anyway.
she said, "you're 65. You retire."
so you two aren't close?
well,
she means well.
a piano. Do you play?
just one song. Greensleeves. My husband theo taught it to me.
well, I'd love to hear it. - Well, that's very sweet of you.
but I only play it once a year.
on his birthday.
when did he pass?
12 years ago.
by the calendar, 12 years.
in here, of course, the day before yesterday.
you had a child.
I- I only see the one photograph.
we lost him, too.
Paulie. His name was Paulie.
he was just three years old.
he'd be about your age.
Yeah, he would.
This-Enough. Time goes on.
I know.
and it keeps going on.
it's relentless.
come on. Let's eat.
okay.
what are you doing?
I just thought.
you haven't even washed your hands.
were you brought up in a barn?
what's so funny?
I forgot to wash my hands.
I'm-I'm usually pretty good about that kind of stuff.
and use soap.
Yes, ma'am.
what does a police consultant do, actually?
well, I do what any regular detective does Except i'm not really on the team.
Really? That doesn't sound fair.
they have their reasons.
I'm gonna write 'em a letter about it.
no, marge. You don't have to do that.
no, no, I- Don't worry.
I am just gonna tell everybody
what a help you were to me With that buddy rich neighbor of mine.
what are you doing?
I'm just separating my...
no, no. These are mixed vegetables.
they're supposed to be mixed like this, see?
you just mix 'em all together and then you eat 'em all together.
you can see i really slaved over this luncheon.
so eat.
so what do you think That your next project is going to be?
think it's gonna be something important?
well, it's interesting, actually.
somebody killed a security guard last night.
killed him?
I haven't figured it out yet.
it happened at the guinness museum.
the only thing that was missing Was one display- A mechanical man.
it was, uh
it was a robot, actually.
a robot?
an egg-Eating robot.
Oh, my word.
it's just one insane thing after another, Now, isn't it?
Yes, ma'am.
don't play with your food, honey.
did i write 'em? Yeah.
I'm not denying it.
but i never hurt anybody.
I'm not a maniac.
I'm a competitive eater.
professional.
he's an athlete.
you see all these trophies?
Yes, ma'am, look
this isn't a magazine interview. There was a murder last night.
a security guard was killed and the man who killed him stole the togo exhibit.
you called Mr. Togo a "sham," a "disgrace," and a "charlatan."
which he is.
it's not slander if it's true.
when togo broke that record, he was in malaysia.
the eggs are smaller there.
they're like 12 centimeters.
everybody knows that.
right. The eggs are smaller in malaysia.
look, in february, in broad daylight,
you defaced the plaque In front of the togo exhibit.
I didn't deface it, okay? I mean, I- I corrected it.
the fact is, My husband is the true world champion.
he beat that record two years ago In mexico city.
he ate 54 eggs in six minutes.
no kidding.
don't touch that.
but the guinness people didn't recognize it.
they said that the last three weren't down.
they were down long enough.
well, I'm sorry i missed that.
Mr. Kasinsky, where were you last night Between 9: 00 and 10: 00 p. M?
last night we were at the chicken meister.
the chicken meister.
it's a restaurant on vinton.
they've got an all-You-Can-Eat buffet.
or so they claim.

no, but they'll remember me.
they'll remember him. - Yeah. Take my word for it.
well, we'll check it out.
okay, go check it out.
look, it wasn't me, okay?

I have got something for you. I don't want to forget.
what-what is it?
I cut this out of the local paper This morning.
contribution of expert consultants Such as adrian monk.
you're famous.
not famous so much as acclaimed, i think.
Mr. Modest.
do you have a- A scrapbook?
no. No.
well, I'll make one for you.
what? - Yeah.
knock, knock.
hello.
sorry to interrupt...
whatever it is you're doing.
we have been looking for you all morning.

not you. Actually, we've been looking for Marge.
me? - Uh, yes, ma'am.
do you have a minute?
well, certainly. Certainly. Come in, sit down.
Yeah, come on in. Sit down.
Yep.
Hey!
what' d you do? You move the furniture?
Yeah, I kind of like it. It's cozy.
I like the scarf.
Yeah, it's, um
a mother's touch.
I don't understand. Has something happened?
a jewelry store was robbed last night,
and the manager, a man named david elliot was shot and killed,
so we really do need to talk to you.
you surely don't think I had anything to do with that.
no, ma'am. Uh, of course not.
but we do have a pretty good idea of who it was.
it was a man named john keyes. - That's my neighbor!
Yes, ma'am, turns out mr. Keyes Worked at that jewelry store.
he was fired last summer for stealing a necklace.
Yeah, and he has a record- Burglary and assault.
so we brought him in.
so how does he look? - He looks good to me.
he smells like the guy. - But
but he has an alibi. He says he was home.
that at 10: 30, at the time of the robbery,
he was playing his drum set.
and it does check out.
according to our phone log,
you called the station at 10: 35 p.m. To complain about the noise.
Yes, I did. I didn't want to bother you again, you know.
sit up, darling.
ms. Johnson. - Marge.
Marge, this is very important.
now, are you sure
are you positive That you heard mr. Keyes at 10: 30 Playing his drum kit last night?
Yes, i-I not only heard it, I saw him.
the light was on and i could look right through the window at him.
it-you know, it was definitely him.
Hello, square one.
thank you.
come on.
they liked the, uh- - This is great.
a stakeout scarf? - Yeah, she knits!
she cooks! She writes!
she's an amazing person.
she sounds like it. - Oh, my god.
I'm gonna bring her to work with me later.
the captain said i could bring her along.
this woman has become very important to you.
well, yeah. - I think it's wonderful.
it's what we call a "transformative relationship."
that's exactly what it is. I- I have been transformed.
I feel like i've found a piece of myself I didn't even know was missing.
Look-Oh, look.
She-she writes me these little notes.
puts 'em in my pockets.
Adrian, I am so happy you are in my life.
love, Marge.
my other mother only left me one noteever, In my whole life.
I found it in my lunchbox.
it said, "your father is driving me crazy."
your other mother? Excuse me?
you just called your real mother Your "other mother."
you're right. Sorry.
wait a minute. No-No. No, i'm not. I'm not sorry.
why should i be sorry?
Marge is a better mother to me than the woman who raised me.
she supports me.
she-she's proud of me.
she loves you. - She loves me.
unconditionally.
it doesn't get better than that. - No. No, it does not.
you're a lucky man.
talk to me. Come on.
what's the catch?
with what?
with Marge. What do you suppose she's after?
every time somebody wants to be my friend,
it turns out they're after something.
they have an angle.
no, not necessarily.
how could somebody- How could anybody Love me unconditionally?
I mean, come on. You've met me.
Adrian, I know you've been burned in the past,
but you have to trust people.
see, there's not always a catch.
then how do you explain this?
there's always a catch.
he's so serious when he works, isn't he?
Yes, ma'am.
I think he's looking for the clue.
Yes, ma'am, he is.
I think he found one.
we're making a scrapbook.
Really?
can't wait to see that.
the body was where?
behind the desk.
we figured the killer came in the door here.
two rounds, 45 caliber.
Oh, i'm sorry, honey. - Excuse me.
so the victim, David Elliot was working here for about a year.
found this in the corner And about 1, 000 fingerprints.
well, they won't be the shooter's.
look at that. Latex rubber.
he wore gloves.
Oh, that's wonderful. We can put that in our scrapbook.
excuse me.
we're working here.
all right. It looks like it's an inside job.
security tapes are missing,
and that was yesterday, So he was plugged in somehow.
we're putting together some names, Going back ten years,
everybody that's ever worked here.
you don't have to go back ten years.
the manager only worked here for a year.
the killer wore a ski mask, Ergo, the killer was afraid he'd be recognized,
ergo, the killer Must have worked here recently.
the killer?
what's that, hungarian?
his name isn't "ergo," Randy.
excuse me, Marge. Don't touch that.
this is a crime scene. - I know, i'm sorry, honey.
but this is amazing. You see this brooch?
I have this brooch.
my husband gave it to me on our 10th anniversary.
it's in this picture. Here.
look.
isn't that the same?
Yes, it is.
who is that?
that's my husband. - No. No, no, no, no, no.
the other picture. This one.
that's paulie.
that was taken just before his passing.
he has a birthmark.
I've seen it before.
on John Keyes.
Mr. Keyes?
Yeah.
you're right.
Yep, he has a mole. Right on the same cheek as paulie.
what do you know?
I'll tell you what i know.
John Keyes is your son.
What?! - No, it makes perfect sense.
they've been in it together,
planning it together from the very beginning.
here's what happened
they knew that once they robbed this store,
John would be the number one suspect.
he needed an airtight alibi.
that's where you came in.
Adrian, you're scaring me. - Monk.
your son got himself a phony I.D.
and rented the house next door.
then you started complaing about his drumming.
Oh, you were the perfect alibi.
who would ever question the little old lady Who lived next door?
and i was your perfect patsy.
you befriended me, you led me on,
you made me love you So that i would vouch for you.
buddy, are you sure about this?
Adrian, I- I hardly know the man. He's a neighbor.
he's your son.
no, he's my neighbor.
he's your son.
he's my neighbor.
he's your neighbor and your son.
okay, Marge.
if that is, in fact, your name.
let's try this again.
where are the jewels?
I don't know.
tell me where they are.
I'll talk to the D.A.
maybe he'll cut you a deal.
Adrian, why are you doing this?
why are you doing this?
look, your son is just down the hall.
Stottle Meyer and Disher are with him now.
it's just a question of which one of you talks first.
don't you call that man my son.
my son is dead, and you know it.
lying... liar!
you're worse than my own mother. At least she never pretended to love me.
and by the way, Your stupid scarf itches.
Mr. Monk. - Not now! Not now.
I'll tell you something else- Your kitchen smells.
okay, your whole house smells. It smells like mold.
and for the record, I was onto your little act from the very beginning.
I was acting, too.
John keyes just made bail. He went home.
his mother picked him up.
his real mother.
okay.
all right, well, thank you.
that was Randy. He's at the department of records.
he said they're not related at all.
she lost her son just like she said.
so there really was no- - There was no catch.
what do I say?
just speak from your heart, Mr. Monk.
here, here, here.
any other ideas? Quick! Anything?
hello.
it's me. Adrian Monk.
I am so...
sorry. - Sorry.
I- I'm sorry for...
everything. - Everything.
I- I accused you of things, And I said things...
I thought there was a catch.
whenever something not horrific happens to me, I don't trust it.
and I- I brought you these.
just put them there.
can we just go back to what we had, Marge?
I have no son.
again.
speak from your heart? What kind of advice is that?
just give her a little time, Mr.Monk. She'll miss you eventually.
she'll come around. - But why?
wh-what would she miss about me?
my accusing her of murder, Dragging her to the police station,
and interrogating her?
for the love of god, what is wrong with me?
are you really asking, or is that a rhetorical?
rhetorical.
is this keyes' house?
Yeah.
what is it?
call the captain.
Where's Randy?
he's on his way??
what have you got?
take a look.
hydraulic fluid. Just like- - Just like the museum.
all right. So what are we looking for?
we're looking for this.
what-what is it?
it's the egg-Eating robot from the museum.
he re-Dressed it.
it's his alibi.
here's what happened
I mean, here's what really happened.
when keyes started playing drums a few weeks ago,
he wanted them to complain. That was the key to the whole plan.
last night, the machine must have been on a timer.
it kicked on at 10: 30
while keyes was across town Robbing the jewelry store.
officer.
it's Marge Johnson.
he's doing it again.
Marge didn't see anybody drumming last night.
what she saw was a machine.
very clever, Mr.Monk.
I'll take that gun, captain.
Hey, Keyes, you don't want to do this. You don't want to kill a cop.
or a ex-Cop. - Or a ex-Cop's assistant.
you, blondie.
gimme your car keys.
come on! You're not gonna need 'em.
all right.
down on your knees.
do it!
captain, get down! Togo! Down, now! Now!
move!
Togo, drop it!
Togo, no!
I knew it.
I knew it. He's sentient.
he's alive!
you guys okay?
science fiction, huh?
Yeah, uh...
they were in it together. Him and the, uh, robot.
well, that explains almost nothing.
you did what you had to do, lieutenant.
be careful with that, will you, please? That was a gift from my husband.
Oh, hi.
Marge, we heard you were leaving. - It's because of me, isn't it?
no, adrian. Please don't think that.
I have a sister in Seattle.
we're gonna buy a townhouse together.
your sister?
she's lonely, too.
we're just gonna try to be a little less lonely.
listen, Marge,
I just want to explain- The things i said
I'm sorry, too.
now, let's just forget it.
wait.
it's a mighty cold world out there, adrian.
you stay warm.
Yes, ma'am.

making THE AUDIENCE LOOK WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE DNOKING.

did YOU SEE THAT?
watch CLOSELY.
if IT GOES HERE, THEN IT CAN'T BE OVER HERE.
if I TAKE IT IN THE LEFT HAND AND PUT IT OVER THERE,
then IT CAN'T BE BACK OVER HERE, CAN IT?
it's HARD TO FOLLOW.
sometimes PEOPLE THINK THE COIN IS TOO SMALL.
I CAN MAKE IT BIGGER.
Hmm... TOUGH ROOM.
I'M...SENSING A LITTLE HOSTILITY.
the NIGHT KEVIN WAS KILLED,
you WERE IN THE THEATER.
I SAW U BACKSTAGE.
you WERE DRESSED AS A MAINTENANCE MAN...

YOU'RE...MISTAKEN...
or YOU'RE BLUFFING.
I WAS 300 MILES AWAY.
and I CAN PROVE IT.
why DID YOU HAVE KEVIN WORK FOR YOU THAT NIGHT?
well, AS I EXPLAINED TO THE POLICE,
I WAS LEAVING TOWN, I NEEDED SOMEONE TO FILL IN,
I' KEVIN BEFORE AND I THOUGHT HE WAS...
quite WONDERFUL.

we SAW KEVIN'S ACT.
he WAS DREADFUL. GOD REST HIS SOUL.
you're WASTING YOUR TIME, MR. MONK!

just FIVE MINUTES BEFORE KEVIN WENT ONSTAGE.
it WAS A DIRECT CALL...
from RENO, NEVADA.
I'm SURE YOU CHECKED WITH THE PHONE COMPANY.
Ooh, LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA RAIN.
you KILLED HIM.
I KNOW YOU DID.
why WOULD I HARM THE BOY?
you DON'T HAVE THE WHY,
and YOU DON'T HAVE THE HOW.
I LOVE THIS PART.
the LOOK ON THEIR FACE...
when THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
??? THIS ISN'T SHOW.
Kevin WAS OUR FRIEND.
he WAS A GOOD MAN WHO NEVER HURT ANYBODY.
and HE WAS 34, AND HIS LIFE WAS JUST GETTING STARTED.
this IS THE MOST BRILLIANT DETECTIVE IN THE WORLD.

and HE'S GONNA PROVE IT-- AREN'T YOU?

the MAN WOULD NOT SHUT UP!
one TIME...
he HAD A SORE THROAT.
he TALKED FOR 21/2 HOURS
about HOW MUCH IT HURT HIM TO TALK.

I'd TURN OFF ALL THE LIGHTS,
pretend I WASN'T HOME.

and LENT IT TO YOU BY ACCIDENT.
that's ALSO A POSSIBILITY.
or MAYBE YOU'RE PHIL,
or PHIL IS SICK, POSSIBLY, AND YOU'RE HIS ASSISTANT CRAIG
no.
not CRAIG. GREG.
I REMEMBER NOW.
Craig LEFT TWO YEARS AGO. - SHOULD I FAST-FORWARD?
Greg, I'M SORRY FOR SCREWING UP YOUR NAME LIKE THAT.
no. LET IT PLAY. - CRAIG WENT BACK TO SCHOOL...
to GET HIS REAL ESTATE LICENSE.
no.
it WASN'T REAL ESTATE.
but IT WAS A LICENSE.
what OTHER LICENSES... ARE THERE?
I'm downtown on the corner of Summerset and Geraldi street,
in front of one of the oldest and ugliest parking garages in the city.
but last month, city council voted to tear down this eyesore,
and replace it with a beautiful playground
and park for the children of this neighborhood.
uh, hold on, Jimmy, something's happening.
somebody's still in the garage? - Something is happening here.
there may be someone still inside the garage.
who's this guy?
what the hell you think you're doing?
I don't know if you heard the news, buddy,
but we gotta tear this whole place down.
you can't do that. - I can't do that?
I got two bulldozers outside says i can.
I'm not leaving!
all right, pal, look.
I don't know what your story is, all right?
but you're going home. Where's the key to the lock?
give it to me.
you gotta be kidding me.
cheese and crackers, we're tearing down a parking garage here.
all right, this is a good thing.
all right, we're gonna build a playground here for the kids.
what's the matter, you don't like kids?
my wife died here.
right over there.
her name was trudy.
she died here.
you can't tear it down.
Mr. Monk, Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk.
Natalie, thank god. - God, are you okay?
you're all over the news. I couldn't believe it.
they were gonna tear it down. Look, you gotta help me.
you gotta. Come on.
hell, no, we won't go!
hell, no-- Come on.
Mr. Monk, I'm not gonna chant with you.
you have to, otherwise the "we" part doesn't make any sense.
none of this makes any sense.
why didn't you call me?
you would have tried to talk me out of it.
all right everybody, let's just calm down, okay?
let's just settle down, all right?
Hi. Hello, Adrian.
I'm Eileen Hill. I'm on the city council.
this parking garage is slated for demolition.
we voted on it last week.
I know. I was there.
why can't we just drag this bozo out of here?
excuse me, do you know who this man is?
this is Adrian Monk.
he was a decorated police officer,
who's been serving this city officially and unofficially for 20 years.
well, he sure isn't serving the city today.
Adrian, i understand you lost your wife here.
where did it happen?
it was right
it was right over there.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
I really am.
but you can appreciate our situation.
there are hundreds of children in this community
councilwoman, this is a crime scene.
this is hallowed ground.
Trudy's case is still open.
there could still be clues here.
something i missed.
if you tear this place down, they'll be gone forever.
I didn't consider that.
you could be letting a killer go free for a swing set or a sandbox.
what's your name? - Robert.
can I call you Bob? - Sure.
Bob, go home. - What?
I believe our decision here was premature.
as I recall, our vote was four to three.
and when the margin is that close,
any member can ask for a second vote.
a second-- A second vote?
Yes, it's called the confirmation vote.
it's called the confirmation vote!
we're gonna tap the brakes on this,
conduct a public hearing, and vote on it again.
fine, it's your call.
Yes, it is.
all right, guys, pack it up, let's go home.
councilwoman hill, I
I can't thank you enough.
I'm not making any promises, adrian.
I can't even tell you how I'm going to vote.
but I do appreciate your service to the city,
and I think you deserve the benefit of the doubt.
see you next week at city hall?
Yes.
I feel this tingling in my chest and in my face.
Yeah, you're happy, Mr. Monk.
I can't believe it. You did it.
I did it.
you just stopped a children's playground from being built,
and saved a parking garage.
so the system works.
let's get out of here.
all right, where's the key?
well, it's not in the sewer.
you don't have to worry about that.
I'm kidding. It's in the sewer.
looks like a married couple.
some swimmers found them. - Swimmers?
Yeah, you know, the polar bear club?
they were stabbed.
two and three times. She got it twice.
detective monk, are we keeping you from something?
city council. They're voting again today.
right, the parking garage thing. Good luck on that.
Mr. Monk, we have plenty of time.
we should leave early, though. Just to be safe.
it's only a ten-minute drive.
look, look. You can see it from here.
we should leave early, just to be sure.
okay, well, they were tourists. Probably german.
Really? Why do you say that?
because they were german.
uh, from berlin. Mr. And Mrs. Erhard helmrich.
uh, we found their wallets and passports in their pockets.
I, uh, talked to a clerk at a hotel.
they were staying downtown at the best western.
he said that they were a pretty quiet couple.
Yeah, they look pretty quiet.
Yeah, but they weren't this quiet.
I mean, before last night.
they were just regular quiet,
like, when they checked in to the hotel.
Yeah, Randy, i know what you mean.
I was trying to be wry.
Oh, sorry, my bad. Do you want to say it again?
what do you got there, a bracelet?
no, it's not a bracelet.
it's a strap. See, it's torn.
she had a camera. Did you find a camera?
no.
then he must have taken it.
he left her jewelry.
this guy had a wallet? Was there still money in it?
Yeah, dollars and euros.
I'm thinking they were walking down here last night,
to get a view of the skyline, maybe,
see the moonlight on the water.
they saw something else.
and they got killed for it.
what was it?
must have been pretty terrible.
something inhuman.
something so horrific-- Is that the time?
we gotta go, we gotta go. Natalie!
wait, we want you to look at some tire tracks.
Yeah, take some pictures. Just get a lot of pictures.
we gotta go.
come on!
all right, so where do they hold these council meetings?
I don't know, we'll have to ask someone.
Adrian monk. And you must be natalie.
paul Crawford. San Francisco dispatch.
Yeah, hello, Excuse me for just one second, sir!
so you're a reporter?
I am the reporter.
I've been following this story.
I'm thinking about doing a story on adrian monk and his parking garage.
man versus playground.
Yeah, I can see it now, you'd make him out to be a monster.
on the contrary, Ms. Teeger, please don't repeat this to anybody,
but, uh, I'm on your side.
hope you pull it off.
wow, that's very sympathetic.
lady, sympathy's got nothing to do with it.
parking's a bitch in that neighborhood.
call me.
Mr. Monk.
okay, it's just upstairs. We're five minutes early.
Hello, Adrian, Natalie.
Hello, Harold.
I heard about your little temper-Tantrum downtown.
it wasn't a temper-Tantrum.
Mm-hmm, whatever it was, it apparently worked.
I have today's agenda here,
and it looks like we'll be voting on your parking garage again.
that's right.
you know, I voted against you last time.
Yes, yes, I know that.
but I've been thinking about it,
and I could be persuaded to change my mind.
Really? - Oh, yes.
how shall i vote?
aye or nay? Up or down?
hmm, I don't know.
it all depends on my mood.
and my mood depends on how I feel.
what does that mean?
your mood depends on how you feel?
you know what it means.
I really, really don't.
do you have any idea what he is talking about?
I'm lost.
I'm talking about your new therapist.
the mystery doctor.
the genius you're always raving about.
who is he? Just tell me his name.
I can't tell you. It's privileged information.
no, it's not.
what happens in the sessions is privileged.
his name isn't privileged.
people recommend therapists every day.
am i right, Natalie?
I don't know, Harold, I'm just waiting for the conversation to be over.
okay, fine, fine.
his name...
is doctor...
door.
doctor door?
is that the best you could do?
I suppose if we were standing over there by that alarm,
you woulda said doctor bell?
Oh, god, Harold. I'm so sorry! - Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
sorry, i'm sorry. - Oh. Oh, no.
you see, the truth is, Harold, i really don't need your vote.
I spoke to councilwoman hill over the weekend,
and she's on my side now.
she's switching her vote? - Well, that's right.
so now the vote is four to three in my favor.
and I believe they call that a "majority."
Oh, Monk, hey, Natalie-- Harold, you're all wet.
you know, the councilwoman, eileen hill,
the one you've been talking about?
Yeah, yeah. Did something happen?
we're not sure.
we just talked to her sister.
she's gone missing.
councilwoman hill's office,
can you hold, please?
councilwoman hill's office, may i put you on hold?
Hello?
Hello, my name is
I can't talk to you right now, okay?
the councilwoman is missing.
it's a madhouse in here.
thank god it's friday. - It's not friday.
who told you that?
well, no one told me. - Councilwoman hill's office,
can you hold? Hello?
they hung up.
I-- I think you disconnected them.
why would I do that? - I don't know.
I'm Natalie Teeger, this is Adrian Monk.
we're working with the police.
we're looking for councilwoman hill.
you should have called first.
I tried. We tried.
but you kept putting us on hold, and then... - Councilwoman hill's office,
Hello? Can i help-- Hello?
hanging up on us.
look, I already talked to the police.
a sergeant or something. I don't remember his name.
he just had a big scar on his face.
just like yours.
I don't have a scar. - Sure, you do.
it's on your cheek. It's right there.
you both do.
I think you have a scratch on your glasses.
is there someone else here i could talk to?
you could talk to her.
I mean someone who works here.
well, you could try janet grote.
she's a legislative assistant.
thank god. Where is she? - She's not in.
here's the thing.
I'm conducting my own investigation.
it's kind of personal.
I need to speak with the councilwoman.
there's a vote that's very important to me,
and they've just postponed it until next week.
when was the last time you saw Ms. Hill?
yesterday morning.
she same in for about an hour.
and then she had to leave. She had an appointment.
great. With whom?
I don't know. I'd have to check her calendar.
could you do that, please?
I don't like you.
there it is.
that's her schedule for the whole week.
Oh, great, can you print that out for us, please?
how am i supposed to get you a copy?
there's a printer right behind you.
Yeah, there's no print button.
Yeah, it's right here. It says P-I-N-T.
pint? - It's abbreviated.
print, printing, printer. Print.
I'm new here.
Really? I never would have guessed that.
are you patronizing me? - No, I'm insulting you.
great.
thank god it's friday.
take your time.
I hope my water doesn't break.
chivalry is dead.
I don't like you at all.
so she disappeared.
her last appointment was 10: 30 a. M. With Paul Crawford.
the reporter.
paul Crawford. - Yeah.
good morning.
I'm captain Leland Stottlemeyer. This is Lieutenant Disher.
you know Adrian Monk, Natalie Teeger.
you're a hard man to find, Mr. Crawford.
we were leaving messages at your house.
my apologies, Lieutenant. I was out all night.
working on a series of articles about police corruption.
confidential, hush-Hush. You understand.
Yeah, I look forward to not reading that.
nice car. - Yes, it is.
all it takes is hard work, a modicum of natural talent,
and marrying a billionaire's only daughter.
and i'm late as usual. Can we walk and talk?
sure.
what about your crusade, Mr. Monk?
how did the vote go?
well, actually, there was no vote.
it's been postponed.
that why you're here?
in a way. Councilwoman hill has officially disappeared.
she's missing?
since monday.
did you check her apartment?
I think she lived with her sister.
we were there last night.
there were no signs of a struggle, nothing unusual.
what about her car?
it was parked out front,
but her wallet and her keys were gone.
not a good sign, is it?
no, sir, it's not.
according to her schedule, uh, she was with you monday morning.
that's true; Eileen met me here at the office.
I have known Eileen for years.
she read an article of mine, and, uh, had a few questions.
did she seem depressed? - No.
had she been drinking?
no, no, no. She wouldn't be drinking now.
what was the article about?
the one she was interested in?
it was about the food industry. Hot dog vendors.
I read that. I haven't had a hot dog since.
Oh, god, the pictures.
I take that as a compliment.
that's actually a talent of mine.
I can take almost anything as a compliment.
Eileen read the article too.
became sort of a pet project of hers.
she said that she wanted to shut all the vendors down.
in fact, she said she was meeting a man named George Gianopolous.
the hot dog czar?
Yeah, when she left, she said that's where she was going.
anything else? - No, sir, that's it.
if we need anything, we'll call you.
look forward to it.
Oh, god.
you missed a couple.
I was buried alive once. - Yeah, i remember.
I was in a box.
I was underground for three hours.
and that box is now the second-most frightening place I've ever been.
Hey!
can i help you? - Yeah, are you Mr. Gianopolous?
you health inspectors?
homicide.
Oh! Hey! It's okay, they're only from homicide!
you scared the bejeezus out of me.
are you the, uh, hot dog czar?
my father was Frankie Gianopolous.
and he was the original czar.
and I was the-- The duke of dogs.
and then, when he passed away
hold on.
Oh, my god, are you okay?
no.
no, I'm fine.
Oh, boy, I'm fine.
Oh, that happens to me three or four times a week.
my doctor can't figure it out.
Really? His doctor can't figure it out.
anyway, when my old man passed,
I inherited his kingdom, so to speak.
you hungry?
Yeah, yeah, sure, I'll take one. I love hot dogs.
Oh, yeah, yeah, take all you want.
we take care of our friends in blue,
and they take care of us.
boy, that's good.
what is that, beef or pork?
we use "meat."
why do you say it like that?
uh, we are required by law to put it in quotes.
Yeah.
Mr. Dog-- Mr. Dog czar,
we're looking for councilwoman eileen hill.
she's been missing for two days.
I heard about that. It was on the news.
I can't help you.
when was the last time you saw her?
Oh, it was, like, three weeks ago. A month, uh
no, they're good.
uh, she did call me on monday morning
and said she was coming over, but she never showed up.
which was fine with me.
you don't like her?
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I would say i hate her.
hate.
and every vendor here feels exactly the same way.
she wants to regulate us to death.
she wants us to wear gloves.
and to put lids on the condiment trays. - Lids!
and to change the water in the pots every other day.
and what's wrong with that?
these dogs are like a fine wine.
they need to simmer.
the simmering. That's the secret.
Yeah, the simmering.
see, the "meat" has to simmer.
anyway, yeah, she never called to cancel.
she never showed up. That's all i know.
Yeah, maybe she did show up.
and maybe you had an altercation.
and maybe you hit her.
and maybe you killed her.
maybe we're gonna have to get a search warrant and tear this place apart.
you go right ahead and be my guest.
believe me,
if I did what you are accusing me of,
I wouldn't just leave her body lying around.
she would be somewhere where no one would find her.
she would be gone.
have a good day.
you hear what he said?
Yeah, some place we'd never find her.
mysterious.
Randy, think about it.
maybe bury her in some park somewhere.
gah, I could eat a million of these things.
there you are.
Oh, thank god you're here.
is that straight? - Yeah, it is.
no, the left side? - No, it's perfect.
I don't think so. - It's perfection.
look, I talked to the captain. - You're blind.
he just looked at the surveillance tapes.
he said Eileen Hill never went near that warehouse.
Plus, the hot dog guy passed a polygraph test.
looks like a dead end. - Yeah, it probably is.
he'll still have to answer to god
for that "meat" he's been serving, though.
maybe the pole is crooked.
how many of these did you make?
1000
and how many have you put up?
uh, including this one,
one. This'll be one.
you're offering a reward?
look, I
I have to find her.
there's gonna be another vote in two days.
I can't win without her.
and you want to make sure she's safe.
what? - And you want to make sure she's safe.
yeah-- Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
that too, yep.
okay, that's-- That's good enough.
let's go. Let's go, let's move on.
we're moving on.
God, if they tear down that parking garage,
I don't know what I'd do.
don't worry, Mr. Monk. Everything's gonna be fine.
she's out there somewhere. Just keep looking.
we will find her.
so, uh, you want me to put this up?
maybe in the waiting room.
I think it might upset some of my patients.
a lot of them are paranoid enough.
well, what if I write "she's probably okay" on the bottom?
maybe.
and by "maybe," you mean
I mean "no." I'm sorry.
Adrian, you've been going back to that parking garage for 11 years.
ever since trudy died. - That's right.
you're there two-- Maybe three times a month.
the forensics people have covered every inch of it.
so here's my question.
do you believe
I mean, do you really believe, in your heart of hearts,
that there's evidence in that parking garage you haven't found?
no.
still, you're determined to save it.
there's a wall on the lower level.
it's a gray wall,
and it says "b-5" in big, red letters.
what about that wall?
it was the last thing that she saw.
I can't live without it.
all right.
here's what i think.
I think you should let it go.
let the children have their playground.
I can't. - I think you can.
five years ago, you probably couldn't.
but now, I think you're ready.
I'll never be ready.
that's why I have to find her.
they're going to vote again tomorrow morning.
without councilwoman hill, it's three to three.
the new vote wouldn't count. They'll tear it down.
you think she was murdered?
it's starting to look like it.
maybe she ran away.
maybe she couldn't stand all those meetings.
I served on the city council.
not here. When i lived in tulsa.
I hated it.
the meetings where interminable.
after a few months, i stopped going all together.
I used to send my secretary in as my proxy.
is that legal?
I was in tulsa.
proxy.
Adrian, you're standing up. Why don't you sit down?
I think you're a genius.
okay, you can stand.
I'm gonna put you on hold.
if you get disconnected, please don't call back.
Oh, it's you again. - Yes, it is. It's me.
did you find her? - Not yet.
actually, I was-- I was looking for ms. Grote.
I told you, she's not in.
she's still not back? - No, she's sick.
she has pneumonia.
she won't be back for two weeks. - Oh, god.
you're a staff member.
I mean, you're-- You're full-time, right?
Why?
you can vote at the hearing tomorrow.
you have the authority.
I don't think so.
no, no, no. It's in the bylaws.
look.
if a council member is absent or incapacitated for any reason, Any member of his or her staff
it's Maria, isn't it?
these are for you.
why were you asking about Janet?
I
I just wanted to make sure she wasn't here.
cause I didn't want her to, you know, get jealous.
are you interested...in politics?
no.
hmm, fascinating.
I like the way you think.
are you, um
are you, uh, busy for lunch,
or do you have a modeling job?
I'm married. - Yeah, no, I know, I know.
strictly business.
there's a big vote tomorrow,
and I just want you to hear my side of it.
I only get 15 minutes,
so I usually just grab a hot dog.
great, perfect.
hot dog.
and some sauerkraut.
not too much.
that's too much.
a little more.
thank you.
you're not hungry?
no-- Uh, no, I'm fine. I ate yesterday.
three dollars.
Oh, uh, let me get that. It's no problem.
thanks a lot. - Thank you.
it was a "pleasure" seeing you again.
I mean, a real "pleasure."
the "pleasure" is all mine. - All right, I get it.
so, Maria, how you holding up?
Oh, it's crazy up there.
reporters keep calling. And detectives.
you don't have any clues or leads or anything?
not yet.
she should have told me she might be disappearing before she hired me.
it's common courtesy.
she could have put it on the flyer.
there was a flyer?
Yeah, in my lamaze class. That's how I got the job.
Really?
it was the easiest job interview I ever had.
we talked for, like, five minutes.
then she gave me a drug test, and that was it.
Oh, I probably shouldn't be eating these things.
Yeah.
if you ever meet my kid in, like, 20 years, - Just don't tell him, okay? - I promise.
what do you think?
about what?
about the parking garage, where my wife died.
can you believe they want to tear it down?
isn't that outrageous?
I guess.
although, you know, a playground would be nice, for the kids.
Yeah, but, they don't really need a playground.
they can play in the parking garage.
it has ramps.
God, kids love ramps, right? - That's true.
they can pretend it's a fort or pirate ship.
they can use their imaginations,
which, i think we need more of.
hmm. Maybe. - Yeah, so if you agree,
all you have to do is go to that hearing tomorrow,
and just raise your hand. Just raise it up, okay?
cast your vote for imagination.
I don't know.
you want me to represent Ms. Hill,
but how do I know what she would do?
she told me.
we talked all about this.
she's on my side.
well, she never said anything to me.
I just wish we could find her journals.
she used to write down all her notes in a journal.
there's no journal. At least, nobody's found it.
did you check her apartment?
Yes, we've been there all week.
what about her other apartment?
she has two.
I can't believe the receptionist knew about this place the whole time.
I know. She even had a key.
why wouldn't she tell anybody?
because nobody asked!
I'm telling you, Natalie, the woman is so stupid,
it hurts me to talk to her.
physically hurts me.
do you see a journal anywhere? She supposedly kept a journal.
looks like she had some roommates.
a cheerleader,
a french maid.
wait.
Oh, you know what?
they weren't roommates, Natalie.
this is a love nest.
that's what it is. - You think?
this is one of those love nests that you read about.
Yeah, but for who? That's the question.
who was she meeting?
Oh, my god!
what? What is it?
nothing. It's nothing.
Mr. Monk,
don't open that drawer, you understand?
whatever happens, whatever you do,
don't ever, ever, ever...
ever... ever, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever open that drawer!
what if there's a clue in there? What if it could solve the case?
I don't care! - Okay, i won't.
all righty. The plot thickens.
now what?
she was pregnant.
is it-- Is it her?
Yeah, it's definitely the councilwoman.
her family just i. D.Ed the body.
Mr. Monk, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, me too.
I know about the zoning thing. I know you were counting on her.
the M.E. Says she's been in the bay since monday night,
probably dumped off the vinton street pier.
where those german tourists were killed?
I hate that pier!
so what do we do now?
we do what we do.
sign on the door says "homicide."
come on.
so we don't know who, we don't know where,
we don't know why, but we do know how.
she was strangled with this.
a very fancy necktie.
chalmers of london. - Yep, very high end.
they don't even sell these in the states.
let's start here.
wouldn't it be easier to get some DNA
and try to find the father?
there is no father.
she was pregnant.
Nope, she wasn't.
but we found those pregnancy tests in her apartment,
and they were all positive.
we told Dr.Kay what you had found.
we had him check twice,
and the councilwoman was not pregnant.
not even close.
okay, wait, i don't understand.
you know, this was her love nest.
no one else lived there.
why should she have somebody else's home pregnancy test?
is this her handbag?
Yeah, we found that tangled in the rope.
so then, - This has to be her journal. - Yep.
can I get a copy of the contents?
already done.
this is it. This is all I need.
a- Ha! - You solved the case?
what? Oh, no, not that.
come on, natalie, we can still make it.
where you going? - City hall.
as you all know, we lost a dear friend this week.
Eileen hill's body was discovered earlier this morning.
let us pray that the san francisco police catch her killer
and bring him or her to justice.
or if they don't catch him,
let us pray that eileen's murder was the work of a random nut job,
or frustrated ex-Boyfriend,
and not some kind of a masked vigilante
who, for some reason, has a personal vendetta against the city council,
and is determined to slaughter us,
one member at a time,
picking us off when we least expect it,
using a different, yet somehow appropriate method
for each of his grisly killings.
Amen.
so let's get started.
Maria Schecter is joining us.
she'll be acting as Eileen's proxy.
I see you're well prepared.
Yes, this is her journal, so i know what she was thinking,
and how she would want me to vote.
Adrian Monk even underlined all the important stuff,
and even made little arrows.
how nice for you.
well, let's get right to it.
we have some old business.
resolution 12-B.
we will be voting yet again
on whether to preserve or demolish the parking garage on summerset avenue.
by a show of hands,
all those in favor of demolishing the garage,
and replacing it with a beautiful,
long-overdue neighborhood playground and park.
three.
all those opposed...
to the children's playground.
democracy in action.
it's a beautiful thing. -I'm not sure it's exactly
what the founding fathers had in mind.
I can't believe i won!
I can't remember the last time i won anything.
did you see harold's face?
Oh, that was the sweetest part.
there he is, there he is.
Mr. Monk.
who wants to shake my hand?
I'll shake anybody's hand.
no wipes, no wipes, limited time offer.
no? Paul?
I'll take you up on that.
congratulations, mr. Monk.
the shrine to your beloved late trudy's still intact,
and i still have my parking space.
Yeah. - All's right with the world.
Yeah. - Congratulations, Adrian.
well played.
thank you, Harold.
I feel like celebrating.
how do people celebrate?
they take their friends to the nearest bar,
and buy them some very expensive wine.
there's one across the street.
I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it.
who's with me? Who's gonna come?
it's my treat.
wait a minute, who said that?
who said that? - Did i say that?
I don't know. - I'm sorry i don't know.
Paul? - I'll catch up to you.
great, great. Maria, let's go.
I can't go, obviously.
Ah, i understand. Well, thanks for everything.
and i'll talk to you later.
you can't drink,
because you're pregnant.
Duh.
can i help you?
you're the guy. - Pardon me?
you killed the councilwoman.
you were her sex lover.
and you killed her.
Oh, my god.
why on earth would i-- - Why? To shut her up.
to save your marriage.
you knew you'd never be able to explain a pregnant girlfriend.
pregnant girlfriend?
I read the coroner's report, mr. Monk.
Eileen wasn't pregnant.
that's right.
she wasn't. But you thought she was.
the day she disappeared,
lieutenant disher asked you if eileen had been drinking.
do you rember what she said?
had she been drinking?
no, no, no. She wouldn't be drinking now.
she wouldn't be drinking now.
why did you phrase it like that?
only one reason.
you thought she was pregnant.
you don't like the way phrased an answer?
what kind of evidence is that?
actually,
the key piece of evidence was right in front of me the whole time.
it was her.
me? What?
I don't know how I could've missed it.
Eileen hill was a well-Educated professional woman.
she was an adult.
this woman, on the other hand, is a dolt.
adult, dolt. Adult, dolt.
adult, dolt, adult dolt-- - Mr. Monk, she's right here.
she knows she's an idiot.
she can't even answer a phone.
have you ever tried talking to her?
it's torture.
question, why would Eileen Hill hire a moron like that?
the answer is simple and heart breaking.
to convince you that she was pregnant.
to manipulate you, to get you to leave your wife.
she need to have a home pregnancy test come out positive.
and for that, she need pregnant urine.
pregnant urine?
that's why she advertised in a lamaze class.
she need to hire a pregnant woman,
so she could give her a drug test.
it was all about the drug test.
it's the only possible reason why eileen hill
or anyone-- Would hire this person.
he doesn't mean it.
of course, you did have some trouble
when you were dumping the body.
but there were two couple tourists on the pier.
did they see you? Did they take a picture?
you probably weren't sure, but you couldn't take a chance.
still waiting for some proof, Mr. Monk.
real evidence.
you mean, like this?
chalmers of london.
imported. Custom made.
just like the one that was around Eileen Hill's neck.
sheriff.
Mr. Crawford, would you come with us, please?
Yeah.
looks like we have two reasons to celebrate.
come on.
a dolt?
sorry?
is that what you think?
after I came down here and voted for you
and helped save your stupid parking garage?
you think I'm an idiot?
I-- I-- I didn't say that.
Yes, you did. Like, 20 times.
you said i was a moron,
and that the only reason anyone would hire me was for my pee.
okay, Maria, I'm sorry. I got excited.
you know, people say things when they get excited.
I can say things too. I'm changing my vote.
what? - I'm changing my vote.
what? - I want the playground,
not the parking garage.
okay, wait a second, you can't
Harold, she can't do that. It's too late, right?
in point of fact, it's not too late at all.
this is only a recess.
the meeting hasn't been officially adjourned.
so the vote isn't final.
read the bylaws. - I read the bylaws.
well, read them again.
let's reconvene the meeting.
we're gonna be voting again.
uh, for the record, I don't think you're a dolt.
your boss looks pretty depressed.
may I suggest that you call his new therapist?
what was his name again? - Dr. Bell.
Dr. Bell. See you in the waiting room.
nice work. - I'm sorry, i'm sorry.
okay?
future site of the trudy monk memorial playground
my four favorite words.
thank you.
thank you very much.
um, excuse me.
Where's the rest of it?
I worked tuesday night, remember?
that was overtime.
Oh, I thought you were just hanging out.
no, Mr. Monk, I wasn't just hanging out.
I spent seven hours reorganizing the utensil drawer.
that was work.
but you said it was fun.
I distinctly remember that.
I said, "isn't this fun"?
and you said, "uh-huh."
so...
you mean unless I'm complaining, you're not going to pay me?
is that the new rule?
even if I wanted to, I've already torn it out of the checkbook.
Yeah, so you just void it out.
void. Write "void."
and then you just write another one.
Natalie, I can't do that.
I wish I could.
if it were up to me-- of course it's up to you.
I need you to use your inside voice.
what-- oh, my god!
God!
I'm a little short of cash right now, okay?
but I'm good for it. You know I'm good for it.
just keep track-- Yeah, I have been keeping track.
it's over $1, 800, Mr.Monk.
Shh.
I'm sorry, the door was open.
I thought I heard screaming.
Oh, no, that's just me.
I scream every payday.
can I help you?
my name is linda kloster.
my husband is Patrick Kloster.
Patrick kloster the chess player.
I was just reading about him.
he's some sort of super genius, like off the charts.
Yes, Patrick has an I.Q. of 180.
four points higher than albert einstein's.
what can I do for you?
well, it's my husband.
he's gonna kill someone.
how do you know?
he told me.
he talks about it all the time.
he says he has a perfect plan. He says it's foolproof.
and that he'll never get caught.
did he say who he's going to kill?
Yes.
it's me.
he's gonna kill me.
um, can I get you something to drink?
we have some wine.
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm three years sober.
three years and two months.
Congratulations.
Mrs. Kloster, isn't it possible that you misunderstood your husband?
Patrick is not an ambiguous man.
he said he's gonna kill me.
in fact, he tells me every day.
as I'm going to bed he'll say, "good night, sweetheart.
it won't be long now.
well, why don't you just go to the police?
I can't prove anything, and he knows it.
it'll be his word against mine.
well, can't you leave, go someplace?
you mean hide from Patrick?
impossible.
I mean, he'd find me in two minutes.
he's a chess grandmaster, the best in the world.
he can anticipate my every move.
murdering me is gonna make him a fortune.
he's taken out a $10 million insurance policy on my life.
did he say when he-- no, but it'll be soon.
when he left this morning, the way he kissed me, it was different.
you know, the way he smiled.
it's definitely coming.
where is he now?
he's playing a tournament in Vancouver.
I've been following it.
that's right.
he's in Canada until tuesday.
at least you're safe until then.
am i?
Mrs. Kloster, I have friends at the department.
Oh, I really appreciate that, Mr. Monk.
but the police can't protect me.
Patrick is smarter than all of them put together.
my husband's gonna murder me.
I'm already dead.
and there's nothing you or anyone can do about it.
here's a check for $5, 000.
I'm a little confused.
if--if you don't think he can be stopped
I'm hiring you to catch him.
you mean after?
that's right.
after he's killed me.
Mr. Monk,
you are the only man smart enough in this world to make him
pay for what he did. Or, rather, what he's gonna do.
I can't--I can't.
I don't know what to say.
say yes, Mr. Monk.
promise me.
promise me you won't let him get away with it.
I promise.
once again, kloster is on the attack.
his dynamic style of play has certainly been on display today.
your sister called again.
she's worried about you.
frankly, so am I.
looks like he's winning again.
I'm sure he is.
is the house alarm on?
Yes, I set it myself.
you'll check it again before you leave?
I always do.
and don't open the door for anyone.
make sure Michael knows.
let me make you some lunch.
no, I think I'm just gonna take a bath and maybe lie down.
I'm going to make you a sandwich.
I'll be right back.
how does she look?
scared to death.
of what? The son of a bitch is in canada.
I don't blame her.
what she needs is a good therapist.
they both do.
I'm happy I'm not a genius.
it screws with your head.
you wanna do her a favor?
put a little scotch in there.
we didn't have any green tea.
but I found some earl grey.
Kevin, it's a restraining order.
you issue 30 of them a day.
no, he hasn't hit her.
Yes, she's still in the house.
because adrian monk told me, that's how I know.
fine, good.
you do that. You sleep on it.
good.
How'd--how'd that go?
forget about him.
look, just get a cruiser out there.
park it out front until further notice.
you can't arrest him for anything?
well, apparently there's no law against giving your wife the willies.
captain, we just got a call.
okay.
you better put down the cup.
just tell me who called.
just put the cup down, or finish it, or drink half of it.
Why?
because you're probably gonna drop it.
I'm gonna have to clean it up.
just have a sip. How 'bout a sip?
Linda kloster's dead.
her housekeeper just found her.
what happened?
I don't know. Let's go.
Mr. Monk-- let's go!
we gotta get over there.
let's go, Randy.
Hey, the calvary's here.
could I have the room, please?
you heard the man. He wants the room.
let's go thank you very much.
Mr. Monk-- not now.
not now.
you can't blame yourself.
Yes, I can.
what did the paramedics say?
probable heart attack.
he killed her.
he said he would kill her, and he did it.
okay.
okay, there was no alarm.
there was no one in the house, just the housekeeper and the cook.
no signs of trauma or suffocation.
poison.
no, housekeeper said she hadn't eaten all day, breakfast, lunch.
so how did he do it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
is he here?
his plane just landed. What did you get?
the M.E. Said natural causes, severe cardiac arrest.
what?
he's already released the body.
what-- what about a complete toxicology workup?
he won't do it, Monk. Not without probable cause.
she was 42 years old.
what about the water?
the tap water in the bathroom?
checked.
well, how 'bout her lipstick.
we checked that too.
I mean, toothpaste, even her eyedrops, everything in the house,
it's all clean.
he killed her. He poisoned her.
but how?
there he is. You can ask him yourself.
Mr.Kloster, how do you feel?
how do I feel?
I'm still in shock.
Linda was my reason for living.
thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth.
where is that from?
look it up.
Patrick Kloster, I'm Leland Stottlemeyer, S. F.P. D.
this is lieutenant Disher.
are you surprised to see us, sir?
Yes, I am.
I mean, I'm surprised to see you here.
I expected you in vancouver.
well, we couldn't afford it.
we're sorry for your loss, sir.
this is Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger.
Yes, of course.
the legendary Mr.Monk.
I was hoping to see you here.
well, hello.
sir, we were wondering if you wouldn't come downtown, give us a statement.
I'm afraid my schedule is rather tight,
but I did take the opportunity of phoning ahead and
reserving a room here at the airport security lounges.
it's nothing extravagant, but it does have a table and five chairs.
how did you know there'd be five of us?
please, miss Teeger, don't insult me.
according to the vancouver police,
they interrupted the match at 1: 21 p. M.
to inform you that your wife had died.
that's right.
they said you kept playing, that you finished the match.
of course I did.
that's what linda would have wanted.
that's funny.
I would have been too upset to concentrate.
I was upset, captain.
that's why it took me 44 moves to win.
your wife came to see me this morning, Mr. Kloster.
did she?
she told me that you had been planning to kill her.
my wife was an unstable woman.
she didn't seem unstable to me.
I'm sure she didn't.
what did the medical examiner say?
heart attack.
she didn't look sick to me.
and what medical school did you attend, miss Teeger?
my wife suffered from high blood pressure.
and for most of her life, she was an alcoholic and a heavy smoker.
she was also quite depressed.
and there was a $10 million life insurance policy.
the policy was linda's idea.
I'm insured for the same amount.
what do you know about poison, Mr. Kloster?
not much.
more than you, I'm sure, but not much.
although I am an expert on the poisoned pawn.
poison-- that is a chess move, lieutenant Disher.
I'd be glad to teach it to you if you'd like.
well, as you can imagine, I have a number of arrangements to make.
do you play chess, Mr. Monk?
a little.
we should play a game sometime.
we already are.
okay, I found somebody.
he's a grandmaster national champion.
and he beat patrick kloster?
almost. They played last year.
it was a tie.
well, where is he?
he's over there. His name is Eric Tovila.
I can't believe you're working on a saturday.
well, he's not paying me, so it's not really work.
Mr. Tovila.
do you have a minute?
I'm a little busy at the moment.
you're Tovila?
I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about patrick kloster.
you know, I'm working here.
you want to talk, you gotta play me.
it's 20 bucks.
Yeah, yeah, I don't--i don't-- I don't think that I have $20.
I don't-- I don't have $20.
I don't-- do you-- do you have-- I don't have 20.
uh, I have $8.
and an I.O.U. For $1, 800 from my boss.
who's next?!
I could play.
$5, right? I'm under 18.
you play chess?
I was in the chess club for two semesters.
two semesters.
Oh, well, that's gonna impress the vassar dean of admissions.
it's your move.
the Bird opening.
I've only seen that five times today.
I understand that you almost beat patrick kloster.
I'll get him next time.
what kind of player is he, would you say?
Kloster's a behaviorist.
he studies you, not the game.
he crawls inside your head, and it's kinda spooky.
Yeah, what is a poisoned pawn?
well, the poisoned pawn is a trap.
he dangles a pawn in the middle of the board.
and, you know, most people can't resist it.
and then he swoops in and crushes you.
it can't resist it.
that's checkmate.
thank you, vassar. That was fun.
a trap.
a trap she couldn't resist.
what? what? what? what?
I know that look.
you did it, didn't you? You figured it out.
who's the real genius now, huh?
who just outsmarted the smartest guy in the whole world?
tell me you.
I did.
this is a funeral home, Mr. Monk.
my wife has just passed.
I find that grin on your face rather inappropriate.
I know how you did it.
you still think I murdered my wife?
you set a trap.
like the poisoned pawn.
Oh, you've been chatting with some chess masters.
good for you.
when I was in your bedroom on wednesday, I noticed a few things.
I just didn't put it all together until today.
the glass that had recently been washed, some breath mints, some eyedrops.
and what did they tell you?
that your wife had started drinking again.
married to you, I don't blame her.
she kept it secret, of course.
at least, she tried to.
how long did it take you to find her secret stash, a day, a week?
on wednesday morning before you left for canada,
you poisoned her bottle then put it back where you found it.
later that day, linda took a drink.
of poisoned pawn.
then she put the bottle back as you knew she would.
it really was brilliant.
you didn't have to hide the poison.
she would drink it and hide it herself.
Natalie, call the captain.
Yes, sir.
and did you find this bottle or this hidden stash of poison?
no, of course not.
it was long gone.
you had four days to get rid of it.
but there are still traces of it in here, in her body.
we're gonna run every toxicology test in the book,
and we're going to find it.
Ah, I'm afraid you can't touch that.
I'm sorry.
she was our niece.
well, I'm a former police officer.
and I'm afraid we have to borrow your niece, her remains,
for a couple of days.
borrow her?
Yes, we have to run some toxicology tests on the body.
Oh, my goodness.
no, no, no, we do it all the time.
we're going to cut her open just-- just a little bit.
and slice off a teeny tiny, tiny piece of her liver and her stomach,
and maybe take a little, tiny,
nearly imperceptible bit of fluid from her eyeball.
like on TV. Who likes TV?
but why?
the fact is we think she may have been poisoned.
but how did the poison get in the cable car?
what cable car?
the cable car that hit her.
that's how Marjorie was killed.
M--m--m-- Mr. Monk, that's not my wife.
my wife is right here.
I had her cremated two hours ago.
as you can see, I have anticipated your every move.
cremated?
Yes, I don't think your toxicology tests are gonna do much good,
but you are welcome to try.
I know that look.
I've seen it quite often.
that's how my opponents look when they know they've been beaten.
your move, Mr. Monk.
in chess, as in life,
creative strategies executed with daring and precision "will allow you to overwhelm your opponent and achieve your goal.
the end.
and may I say, thank god.
keep reading. Here's the next one.
Oh, Mr. Monk, come on.
we've been reading his books all day.
what good are they doing?
I'm getting into his head.
he's in my head.
I have to be in his head, so we're in each other's heads.
chess domination by Patrick Kloster.
well, this will be the opposite of fun.
for my queen, Tatiana.
you don't have to read the dedication.
fine, sorry.
what's this?
Linda kloster's check.
you didn't deposit this?
I'll never deposit it.
but, Mr. Monk, she wanted you to cash it.
Mr. Monk, if you deposit this check, then you can pay your staff.
and when I say "staff," I mean me.
but she came to me.
I didn't protect her.
Mr.Monk, you did everything you could.
what about the promise I made that he wouldn't get away with it?
you made a promise to me too.
there he is.
what?
he's coming. What do we do?
we should kiss. No!
I didn't say that. I wasn't thinking.
I never said that.
good morning.
I thought you might be thirsty.
well, this is for you, Natalie.
it's lemonade.
and, Mr. Monk, I believe this is your brand.
Oh, my books.
I could autograph one for you.
no, thank you. No.
very well.
I'll leave you two alone.
enjoy your little stakeout.
well, you have to admit, he's pretty good.
what? he was right. I was thirsty.
what?
how do you feel?
uh, I feel fine.
what?
it just occurred to me.
if there's poison in that lemonade, we could go to the D. A.
and we'd have all the evidence we need.
it just occurred to you, and you didn't say anything?
Mr. Monk, I have never seen you like this.
how do you feel now?
you know, I hate to disappoint you, but I feel fine.
try the water.
that is it. We are going home.
wait.
stop the car.
what? what are you doing?
just stop, stop, stop the car.
wait. What are you do-- stop.
where are you going?
his garden.
his garden?
oleander. It's from his garden.
it's poisonous. Very poisonous.
you dry the sap, you grind it into a powder.
a quarter of a gram is enough to kill an adult.
it would look like she had a heart attack.
did look like she had a heart attack.
this is how he did it.
so you were in his garden on his property?
you said you wanted evidence, hard evidence.
here it is.
monk, a million people have this flower in their garden.
I used to have some.
let's let the d. A. Decide.
monk, I'm not going to the D.A.
waving a shrub.
look, you don't seem to understand.
this Patrick Kloster thing is a big, bad headline just waiting to happen.
now I know that you're upset.
I know that this case is very important to you.
but we need real hard evidence.
maybe if you found some powder already
ground up in a little bottle inside his house.
maybe then.
in a bottle?
right, we wouldn't even need his fingerprints.
we could just say he wore gloves.
What'd you say?
nothing. Nothing.
can I talk to you for a minute?
come here, I want to show you something.
what is it?
down the hall there's a sign I think is a little crooked.
I want your opinion.
crooked. I'll be right back.
come on.
how crooked is it?
Oh, it's very crooked. You're not gonna believe it.
why do you need me?
cause I'm not sure if it is crooked.
you just said it's very crooked.
look, I don't know, Monk.
is anybody else in there?
it's in here.
there's nothing crooked in here.
I hope not.
don't do it.
don't do what?
break my heart.
you're thinking about planting evidence in Kloster's house.
monk, I've been a cop for 30 years.
I've had this conversation nine times.
I never thought that I'd be having it with you.
there's a line.
you step across it, and you're gone for good.
there's no going back.
you don't understand.
I do understand.
I've been there.
I've had cases like this, cases you couldn't shake.
sometimes you have to let it go.
let it go?
we have to move on.
there's a city, a city full of people,
other people that need our help right now.
when Trudy was dying, I got there late, almost too late.
I was there.
she was slipping away. She couldn't speak.
all she could do was reach out.
she-- she grabbed me with both hands.
like this.
11 years later, I still feel it.
when I promised Linda Kloster,
when I gave her my solemn word that her husband would pay,
she grabbed my hand the exact same way.
I'm not letting this one go.
I'm not moving on.
that's an illegal move, Mr.Monk.
something I'd expect from a much weaker player.
the truth is, I have been waiting for you all night.
I'd almost given up.
you were waiting for me?
ever since I noticed a branch missing from an oleander bush in my garden.
you don't really think that window was left unlocked by accident, do you,
Mr. Monk?
Mmm, breaking and entering.
I believe that is a felony.
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not a litigious man.
I prefer to settle my problems out of court, as you well know.
I am replaying a match of mine from 1995.
boris Spassky was playing white.
where would we be without our little games, hey, Mr.Monk?
64 perfect little squares.
an island of order in a chaotic world.
this is where I beat him, right...
there.
this is a wedding gift.
you dedicated one of your books to "my queen Tatiana."
you were married before.
very good, Mr.Monk.
divorced?
my wife died.
she must have been quite ill.
Yes, she was.
let me guess, heart attack?
Mr. Kloster, The district attorney's office
and captain Stottlemeyer would like to exhume the body of your first wife.
I've read their application.
they've listed a number of similarities between the two cases.
your first wife, Tatiana Bay Kloster,
was in her 30s, apparently healthy,
and died from a sudden and severe cardiac event.
she too was heavily insured.
captain Stottlemeyer and Mr. Monk have been to Pacifica.
they've spoken to some of your old neighbors.
and a few of them remember you had
oleander plants in your garden 15 years ago.
I'm convinced there's a clear and unique pattern of behavior.
I am going to grant this petition.
your first wife's body will be exhumed first thing tomorrow.
and let me warn you.
if in fact there are traces of this poison in her body,
you can expect the district
attorney's office to bring two counts of murder.
section 261.
there.
here.
here it is.
Harry, over here!
you're making a big mistake.
you made the mistake, Kloster.
you should have had your first wife cremated too.
sorry for the delay.
we know how important this is, so we wanted to make sure.
there was no poison in the body.
we didn't find a thing.
impossible.
the woman died of natural causes.
we're sure of it.
thank you, Mr.Monk.
what for?
uh, our little game.
to be honest with you, I'm sorry it's over.
Hello, everybody.
thank you so much for your generous support.
we're gonna begin the exhibition in just a few minutes.
international grandmaster patrick kloster will be playing
simultaneous matches against four of
the highest ranked players in california.
it should prove to be very exciting.
Oh, there's that kid from the park.
what a geep.
what's a geep?
well, it's a geek who's a little creepy.
all right, Mr.Monk, I have to be honest.
I'm still not quite sure why we're here.
he won't talk to you.
he won't return your phone calls. What can we do?
I don't know.
but I can't just quit.
to me, quitting would be like giving up.
if I was playing against him, he'd have to talk to me, right?
okay, wait here.
what's she doing?
she's, uh, she's flirting.
she's good at it. Shut up.
she's definitely done this before.
okay.
Yeah, she's got it down.
thank you.
mom, you remember my friend Eric.
I told him about the case.
and about how you think Mr. Kloster killed his wife.
I believe it too. Congratulations.
you're player number one.
you mean I can play in the tournament?
you're my proxy. It's in the bylaws.
I can designate someone to take my place.
thank you.
don't bring out your queen too early.
ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome international grandmaster Patrick Kloster.
well, well, well, the tenacious Mr.Monk.
your threshold for pain must be extraordinary.
it's your move.
Yes, I know.
Linda must have truly despised me to have brought you into my life.
Mr. Monk.
that's my piece, mr. Monk.
I'm just centering it.
you'll thank me later.
Mr. Monk.
Mr. Monk, please.
I pass.
you can't pass.
for the love of god, why don't you just resign?
how 'bout this.
if I win this game, you have to tell me how you poisoned your wives.
what are you talking about?
I am not agreeing to that.
how 'bout this, if we play to a draw,
you come with me to police headquarters
Mr. Monk, I'm not negotiating with you.
when are you going to realize that it is over?
you're castling?
Yes, the rook and the king switch places.
they switch places.
Yes, it's the best way I know to get oneself out of trouble.
this is it.
you came here that night before we exhumed your wife's body.
and you switched headstones.
that's why we didn't find any poison.
we dug up the wrong body.
very good, Mr.Monk.
you play a brilliant endgame.
right.
can I tell you something?
I am sick and tired of you talking like this, all these chess metaphors.
two women are dead.
they're not chess pieces, Patrick.
they're human beings.
I think they deserve better.
although, if you insist, checkmate.
what?
nothing.
I was just thinking about the case and how you solved it.
you really are amazing.
well, thank you.
no, you really are my hero.
okay.
I know this sounds crazy,
Mr. Monk, but could I have your autograph?
Oh, please.
please, just to have it for myself, like a keepsake.
come on, it'll just take a second.
all right, if it really means something to you.
okay.
thank you.
that's Linda Kloster's check.
which you just endorsed. I'll be right back.
I'm going to the bank.
you can't deposit that. Why not?
you solved the case. You kept your promise.
besides, I need the money.
Natalie, let--let go. Just give it back.
I think those books are out of order.
where? dah!
Nat-- dah!
Oh, my god, they really are out of order.
right.
okay.
Oh, THAT'S GREAT.
no, I'M SURE HE'LL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU.
okay, SO WHAT'S THE CROSS STREET?
Yeah. I DO KNOW WHERE THAT IS.
it's ? across FROM THE WELLS FARGO BUILDING.
great. 1: 00.
we'll SEE YOU THERE.
no, THANK YOU.
Bye.
who WAS THAT?
remember HOW WE WERE TALKING ABOUT KARMA?
no, I DON'T.
remember WHEN I SAID
if YOU PUT GOOD ENERGY OUT INTO THE WORLD
good THINGS WILL COME BACK.
well IT WORKED.
that WAS A REAL CLIENT WITH A REAL JOB.
the DROUGHT IS OVER.
great, GREAT. SO WHAT'S THE CASE?
uh, HE WOULDN'T SAY.
we're GONNA MEET HIM TOMORROW.
his NAME IS RODERICK BRODY.
I USED TO KNOW SOMEONE-- - NO, THAT'S THE GUY.
he SAID YOU WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HIM.
uh, YEAH, HE SAID YOU WERE OLD FRIENDS.
Adrian, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
Hello, ROGER.
washing YOUR HANDS AGAIN, HUH?
what IS THIS THE, UH, TENTH TIME TODAY?
what A FREAK.
you KNOW, IS HANDS ARE CLEAN
but HIS HAIR LOOKS A LITTLE DIRTY.
what DO YOU THINK? - YEAH.
and IS THAT WATCH RIGHT?
Oh, MAN, IT'S 2: 25.
swirly TIME. - NO, NOT SWIRLY TIME.
not AGAIN.
actually THAT WATCH IS TWO MINUTES FAST.
go GRAB THE DOOR. - ROGER, WH-WH-- WAIT.
how ABOUT THIS?
I'll GIVE YOU MY BIKE FOR KEEPS
and ALL MY LUNCH MONEY EVERY DAY
and I'LL DO YOUR HOMEWORK FOR THE WHOLE YEAR.
okay. IT'S A DEAL.
but FIRST, SWIRLY TIME.
my HAND HURTS.
Mr. MONK, WHERE IS YOUR OVEN MITT?
COME-HERE.
come HERE, COME HERE, COME
you OKAY?
what WERE YOU DOING?
he's BACK.
thank YOU AGAIN FOR SQUEEZING ME IN.
I'm HAPPY TO DO IT, ADRIAN.
just SOMETHING I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.
we ALREADY HAD AN APPOINTMENT FOR 3: 00.
Yeah, 3: 00 IS TOO LATE.
you REMEMBER RODERICK BRODY?
Yes, THAT'S THE BULLY FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL
who USED TO, YOU KNOW-- IN THE LAVATORY.
swirlies. THEY'RE CALLED SWIRLIES.
he CALLED YESTERDAY.
I'm SUPPOSED TO MEET WITH HIM THIS AFTERNOON.
what DOES HE WANT?
what DO YOU THINK HE WANTS?
he WANTS TO PICK UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF.
Adrian, I DON'T THINK A 50-YEAR-OLD MAN
is CALLING YOU BACK AFTER ALL THIS TIME JUST TO...
to GIVE YOU ANOTHER SWIRLY.
you DON'T, HUH? - NO, I DON'T.
okay, LOOK.
Roderick BRODY CHANGED MY LIFE.
maybe AS MUCH AS TRUDY DID.
he RUINED EVERYTHING.
it WAS CHILDHOOD'S END REALLY.
you KNOW I HAD A BULLY IN SCHOOL TOO.
he WOULD WAIT FOR ME EVERY MORNING OUTSIDE THE BICYCLE RACK
excuse ME. SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
you WENT TO YOUR FATHER FOR ADVICE
and HE TOLD YOU TO FACE UP TO THE BULLY
and THE BULLY BACKED DOWN.
mm, YES, MORE OR LESS, YES.
what A WONDERFUL ANECDOTE.
it'll GIVE ME SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AT 1: 00
when MY HEAD IS IN THE MAN'S TOILET.
why DON'T YOU JUST CANCEL?
just SAY YOU'RE BUSY.
Natalie WON'T LET ME!
it's THE FIRST PAYING CUSTOMER WE'VE HAD IN THREE WEEKS.
look, WHAT I NEED IS A NOTE, OKAY?
a NOTE FROM YOU.
something I CAN SHOW NATALIE TO GET ME OUT OF THIS.
Adrian, I'M NOT GONNA WRITE YOU A NOTE. - YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE IT.
it's ALREADY WRITTEN.
all YOU HAVE TO DO...IS SIGN IT.
Adrian, THIS ISN'T GYM CLASS.
now YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS RODERICK BRODY
since THE FIRST SESSION. HMM?
and AS I RECALL,
you're STILL HAVING NIGHTMARES ABOUT HIM.
I THINK THIS MEETING TODAY IS A GIFT.
it's AN OPPORTUNITY.
maybe YOU'RE RIGHT. LET'S SIGN THE NOTE
it's AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONFRONT YOUR DEEPEST AND MOST TROUBLING FEARS.
to FINALLY RESOLVE THEM.
put THEM ALL BEHIND YOU.
not MANY PEOPLE GET THIS CHANCE.
I SEE YOUR POINT.
I NEVER LOOKED AT IT LIKE THAT.
can I HAVE THE NOTE BACK?
sure.
wait A...
you're NOT PLANNING TO FORGE MY SIGNATURE?
no.
God.
all RIGHT, LET'S JUST HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.
if YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE, WE'LL LEAVE.
I PROMISE.
Really? - YEAH.
I'm NOT COMFORTABLE.
come ON.
not COMFORTABLE.
Mr. MONK, WE HAVEN'T EVEN SAID HELLO.
wait.
wait.
okay-- WAIT!
okay, WAIT, WAIT.
what IS THAT?
is THAT A SHOWER CAP?
sometimes HE'D LET ME WEAR ONE.
Mr. MONK, I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA BE NEEDING THAT.
and YOU MUST BE NATALIE.
Marilyn BRODY.
Oh, RODERICK IS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS.
I'm SURE HE IS.
come IN. PLEASE.
thank YOU.
Wow. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HOME.
Oh, THANK YOU. YOU ARE VERY SWEET.
really, IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.
we're REDOING ALL THE BATHROOMS UPSTAIRS.
which REMINDS ME I NEED TO CALL THE CONTRACTOR.
we're HAVING A PARTY IN THREE WEEKS.
did YOU GET MARRIED HERE?
Yes, THERE WAS NO REASON TO RENT A BIG HALL.
I DON'T HAVE MUCH FAMILY.
I WAS ADOPTED. - OH.
I THINK THEY'RE THE BEST.
Yeah.
he's OBVIOUSLY BUSY.
so IT'S TOO BAD WE MISSED HIM.
but WE SHOULD GO, NATALIE. WE MISSED HIM.
no, NO, NO. NO, YOU CAN'T GO.
he's RIGHT UPSTAIRS.
I'll TELL HIM YOU'RE HERE.
it WAS SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
you TOO.
she SEEMS NICE.
how BAD COULD HER HUSBAND BE?
it DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK LIKE THAT.
Eva BRAUN TOOK IN STRAY PUPPIES FOR GOD'S SAKE.
at LEAST WE KNOW HIS CHECKS WON'T BOUNCE.
look AT THAT THING.
that IS HIDEOUS.
God.
he's WARMING UP.
shower CAP. SHOWER CAP. - NO.
no. - SHOWER CAP!
give IT. GIVE IT. - YOU DON'T NEED IT.
Phil, SHUT UP AND LISTEN, OKAY?
it's NOT A COMPLICATED THING.
it's NOT HIS MONEY. IT'S MY MONEY.
you TELL HIM THIS.
screwing WITH ME ON THIS IS A CAREER DECISION.
he'll GET THE MESSAGE.
Adrian MONK! LOOK AT YOU.
you HAVEN'T CHANGED AT ALL.
Hello, RODERICK.
Oh, YOU STILL GOT THAT GERM THING?
he WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OF TOUCHING PEOPLE.
designated HAND-SHAKER. - HI.
we WERE JUST ADMIRING YOUR BEAUTIFUL HOME.
Yeah, GETS THE JOB DONE. - YEAH.
if YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING,
is-- IS THIS AN ORIGINAL?
well IT BETTER BE, WHAT I PAID FOR IT.
Yeah, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
Thanks, YEAH.
Marilyn PICKED IT UP ON OUR HONEYMOON.
it's PORCELAIN. - OH.
I DON'T GOTTA TELL YOU ABOUT PORCELAIN.
do I, SWIRLY?
it WAS A LITTLE NICKNAME WE HAD FOR HIM BACK IN THE DAY.
remember THOSE SHENANIGANS IN THE BOYS' ROOM?
good TIMES.
I GOT A STUDY BACK HERE.
we CAN, UH, TALK IN PRIVATE?
shenanigans.
want A DRINK?
no?
well I GOT PLENTY HERE IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.
listen, ADRIAN, I GOTTA BE HONEST.
I've HEARD STORIES.
I HEARD YOU WENT A LITTLE CRAZY SINCE WE GRADUATED.
now I JUST NEED TO KNOW,
is IT FUNNY CRAZY OR SAD CRAZY?
funny CRAZY. - SAD CRAZY.
okay.
excuse ME.
there's SOMETHING THAT I HAVE TO SAY.
you STOLE SOMETHING FROM ME.
you STOLE MY CHILDHOOD.
the BOY THAT YOU TORMENTED HAS GROWN "INTO A BROKEN MAN.
I AM NOW DAMAGED GOODS.
I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU.
and I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.
so IT'S SAD CRAZY.
no, I THINK MR. MONK IS TALKING ABOUT
what YOU DID TO HIM IN THE SEVENTH GRADE.
you TORTURED HIM.
kids. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
let's HAVE A SEAT, HUH?
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR COMING, ADRIAN.
but THE FACT IS...
this IS A PERSONAL MATTER.
I NEED YOUR HELP, ADRIAN.
I HEAR YOU'RE A BIG SHOT DETECTIVE NOW.
no SURPRISE THERE.
I ALWAYS KNEW YOU HAD IT UPSTAIRS.
this IS HARD FOR ME.
it's PROBABLY HARD FOR ANY GUY.
I THINK MARILYN'S BEEN STEPPING OUT.
Really?
Yeah, I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER.
me AND MARILYN, WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN, YOU KNOW, ROCK SOLID.
at LEAST THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
last WEEK SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS GOING OUT OF TOWN WITH SOME GIRLFRIENDS,
but SHE NEVER LEFT.
I SAW HER.
well WHERE WAS THIS?
Lafayette SQUARE TWO DAYS AGO.
it WAS JUST A RANDOM THING.
I WAS IN A CAB.
there WAS A RED LIGHT.
and THERE SHE WAS...CROSSING THE STREET.
she WAS MEETING SOMEONE.
I COULD TELL THE WAY SHE WAS WALKING.
the WAY SHE WAS DRESSED.
it's BEEN EATING ME UP.
I GOTTA KNOW WHERE WAS SHE GOING.
it's A GOOD QUESTION.
Mr. BRODY, I'M SORRY.
we DON'T TAKE ON MATRIMONIAL CASES.
we COULD GIVE YOU THE NAME OF A PRIVATE-- - HOLD ON, NATALIE.
I've KNOWN ROD FOR YEARS.
well...
he's ONE OF MY...
oldest FRIENDS.
I THINK WE CAN MAKE AN EXCEPTION.
I'll TAKE THE CASE.
what WAS THAT ABOUT?
she's CHEATING ON HIM.
we DON'T KNOW THAT.
of COURSE WE DO.
it HAS TO BE TRUE. IT'S ALWAYS TRUE.
and I GET TO TELL HIM, NATALIE.
this IS GONNA KILL HIM!
wait, MR. MONK, YOU CAN'T ENJOYING THIS.
I AM LOVING IT.
look, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
I THINK THE SUN'S COMING OUT.
Oh, MY GOD.
this IS BETTER THAN A SWIRLY.
I WIN. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
after 40 YEARS, I WIN.
okay, HE SAID HE LOST TRACK OF HER RIGHT HERE.
which WAY DID SHE GO?
that WAY.
I DON'T THINK SO.
she WAS WEARING HIGH HEELS.
that's A COBBLESTONE STREET AND IT'S ALL UPHILL.
so WEST?
no, THERE'S NOTHING BETWEEN HERE AND THE PIER.
all RIGHT, WELL THAT LEAVES NORTH OR SOUTH.
that WAY.
why THAT WAY?
I FEEL LUCKY!
isn't THIS THE BEST CASE EVER?
I've NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THIS.
God, I NEVER KNEW REVENGE COULD BE SO SWEET.
and WHAT MAKES IT EVEN SWEETER?
give UP?
Roderick BRODY IS PAYING FOR IT.
he IS FOOTING THE BILL FOR HIS OWN COMEUPPANCE.
and THAT IS THE BEST KIND OF COMEUPPANCE THERE IS.
excuse ME, KIND SIR.
have YOU SEEN THIS WOMAN?
she's CHEATING ON A GUY
who USED TO PUT MY HEAD IN A TOILET BOWL.
isn't THAT GREAT?
Mr. MONK, DON'T YOU FEEL BAD EVEN A LITTLE?
I MEAN IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
this COULD DESTROY THEIR MARRIAGE.
you're THE ONE WHO'S ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT KARMA.
right? WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND.
isn't THAT WHAT YOU SAID?
that ISN'T WHAT I MEANT.
of COURSE IT IS.
of COURSE IT IS.
Oh, THAT LOOKS PROMISING.
come ON.
Hi, EXCUSE ME.
Hi, UM,
we're LOOKING FOR THIS WOMAN.
you A COP?
no.
no, NO, NO. JUST AN OLD FRIEND.
haven't SEEN HER.
okay.
maybe GENERAL WASHINGTON CAN REFRESH YOUR MEMORY.
is-- IS THAT A DOLLAR?
okay, I GET IT.
who KNOWS? MAYBE THERE ARE...
two GENERAL WASHINGTONS.
where ARE YOU GOING?
Where's HE GOING?
got TO ADMIRE THE GUY. HE'S INCORRUPTIBLE.
Hey.
she's RIGHT OVER THERE.
Oh, MY GOD. IT'S TRUE. - OH, MY GOD.
this...Is GOING TO KILL HIM.
he's ACTUALLY KIND OF CUTE.
even BETTER.
all RIGHT, I GET TO TELL HIM.
that's THE DEAL.
Oh, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIS FACE.
Mr. MONK.
what IS THAT?
is THAT YOUR CAMERA? WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
it WAS A BIRTHDAY GIFT.
from WHO? THOMAS EDISON?
it WAS FROM MY NANA.
wait, IS THERE ACTUAL FILM IN IT?
of COURSE THERE'S FILM IN IT.
I HAVE THREE PICTURES LEFT.
okay, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LIGHT.
so...
so...
is THAT A FLASH CUBE?
bingo.
hold THIS. HOLD IT.
okay, OKAY.
what ARE YOU DOING?
it's AN OLD PRIVATE EYE TRICK. HOLD THAT.
I'm GONNA USE IT AS A MIRROR.
hurry UP. TAKE THE PICTURE.
take IT.
you LIKE THAT SOON, HUH?
Yes.
sir, UM,
would YOU MIND TAKING OUR PICTURE?
Madame, I WOULD BE HONORED.
Oh, THANK YOU.
here YOU GO.
it's READY TO GO.
Hey.
I GOT THE SAME MODEL MYSELF.
a GIFT FROM MY NANA.
okay, SIR, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND STANDING RIGHT...
there.
okay, CAN YOU SEE US? - I GOTCHA.
okay, IF YOU COULD STAND RIGHT THERE.
right?
and ON THE COUNT OF THREE.
WELL...YOU'RE RIGHT.
his NAME IS DOUGLAS FENDLE.
do YOU KNOW HIM?
FENDLE? NO.
are YOU SURE?
young, STRAPPING, GOOD-LOOKING GUY.
viral. YOU DON'T KNOW HIM?
she MET HIM AT A BAR ON VINTON STREET,
had A COUPLE OF DRINKS, AND HE LEFT FIRST.
Yeah, THE VIRAL GUY LEFT FIRST.
we FOLLOWED HIM TO THE AVALON HOTEL ON JACKSON PLACE.
Roderick, I'M REALLY SORRY.
Yeah, WE'RE REALLY, REALLY SORRY.
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
this IS SO DARK.
Yeah, WELL THAT FILM EXPIRED ABOUT 35-40 YEARS AGO.
but THAT'S HER.
if YOU WANT TO CRY, GO AHEAD.
we-- WE UNDERSTAND.
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.
this DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.
Yep.
you KNOW IT'S HER. RIGHT?
because YOU SAW HER ON THE STREET.
that's WHY YOU HIRED US.
you KNOW, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'm NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.
the WOMAN I SAW, MAYBE SHE WASN'T MARILYN, you know.
my EYES AREN'T SO GREAT.
I-- I COULD'VE BEEN WRONG.
no, NO, NO. YOU WEREN'T WRONG.
it WAS HER.
I'm JUST, UH,
I'm NOT CONVINCED.
I NEED SOME REAL PROOF.
you KNOW LAST NIGHT WAS OUR ANNIVERSARY
and MARILYN SURPRISED ME.
she BOUGHT US TICKETS.
we're GOING ON A CRUISE.
like A SECOND HONEYMOON THING.
I THINK WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE.
no.
no, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE IN A BAD PLACE.
you're IN HEARTBREAK HOTEL.
look AT THE NEXT ONE.
is THAT A...SPOON?
Yeah, LOOK CLOSER.
see THE REFLECTION?
Yeah. SEE, THAT'S THEM.
that's YOUR WIFE.
that's YOUR BELOVED WIFE.
this IS KILLING YOU.
I DON'T SEE IT.
no, IT'S EATING YOU UP.
you KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
it-- IT-- THE BAR WAS DARK.
she WAS ACROSS THE ROOM.
we PROBABLY HAVE THE WRONG GIRL.
Natalie-- - MR. MONK, WE MADE A MISTAKE.
Shh. ZIP IT.
zip IT.
this IS THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE, RIGHT?
are YOU CRYING?
a LITTLE BIT?
Adrian, I'M STILL GONNA PAY YOU.
if THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.
Oh, WHAT? THE GUN?
don't WORRY ABOUT THAT. I GOT A PERMIT.
we LIVE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES.
for YOUR TROUBLES.
all RIGHT, HOW ABOUT THIS?
I'll KEEP DIGGING.
I'll GET A BETTER CAMERA.
I'll GET A DIGITAL COMPUTER CAMERA.
so THERE WON'T BE ANY DOUBT.
Adrian, I APPRECIATE IT.
but JUST FORGET ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?
it's OVER.
you're OFF THE CLOCK.
great.
great. GREAT.
it TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.
did YOU GET IT?
Oh, YEAH.
is IT A GOOD ONE? - YEAH.
Oh, LOOKS GOOD.
she LOOKS HAPPY WITH IT.
Yes, SHE DOES.
and SHE'S VERY HARD TO PLEASE. - WHERE'S THE TELESCOPE THING.
it HAS AUTOMATIC ZOOM, SO IT'S BUILT-IN.
built-in? EXCELLENT.
Mr. MONK, IT'S NOT HEART SURGERY.
if WE LEAVE RIGHT AWAY,
we CAN BE AT HER HOUSE BY 8: 00.
we CAN FOLLOW HER ALL DAY.
Yeah, LOOK, UM, MR. MONK,
I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I MADE A DECISION.
if YOU WANT TO KEEP FOLLOWING MRS. BRODY,
I SUPPOSE THAT'S YOUR RIGHT.
although IT REALLY ISN'T.
but I CAN'T HELP YOU ANYMORE.
why NOT?
I-- I-- I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE.
her HUSBAND FIRED US.
it's WHAT THEY CALL PRO BONO.
no, PRO BONO IS FOR LAWYERS.
this IS STALKING.
no, THIS IS COMEUPPANCE.
pro BONO COMEUPPANCE.
no, THAT IS JUST CRAZY TALK.
it's NOT CRAZY TALK. - PRO BONO COMEUPPANCE?
it's THE CRAZIEST TALK THERE IS.
you HEARD WHAT HE SAID. HE WANTS YOU TO QUIT.
I WANTED HIM TO QUIT!
I BEGGED HIM TO QUIT 40 YEARS AGO IN STALL NUMBER THREE.
Oh, YEAH. - HELLO?
Yes, HE IS RIGHT HERE.
the AVALON? SURE, WE KNOW IT.
we WERE JUST THERE.
wait, WHAT'S HIS NAME?
Oh, MY GOD.
what HAPPENED?
his NAME IS DOUGLAS J. FENDLE.
or, UH, RATHER ITWAS DOUGLAS J. FENDLE.
I GUESS STILL IS.
but DOESN'T MATTER.
let's MOVE ON.
uh, HE WAS 37, UNMARRIED, FROM CHICAGO.
Mr. FENDLE WAS AN ATTORNEY.
he WORKED AT A SMALL LAW FIRM.
uh, MOSTLY FAMILY LAW.
wills, ADOPTIONS.
Hey, YOU OKAY?
dynamite.
Yeah, RIGHT.
good. LOOK, I TALKED TO HIS BOSS.
she SAID HE WAS ON VACATION.
she DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE WAS HERE.
hmm, INTERESTING.
according TO THE CLERK,
he CHECKED IN THREE DAYS AGO.
kept TO HIMSELF.
housekeeping FOUND THE BODY THIS MORNING.
doctor TEE PUTS THE TIME OF DEATH AT 8: 00 OR 9: 00 PM LAST NIGHT.
he WAS STABBED THREE TIMES.
Ouch. - MR. MONK.
there WAS MONEY STILL IN HIS WALLET,
so IT WASN'T A ROBBERY.
no. WASN'T A ROBBERY.
Yeah, AND...
there WAS NO FORCED ENTRY.
he LET THE GUY IN.
I THINK HE KNEW HIM.
I THINK HE DID TOO!
excuse ME. - I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
can I TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE PLEASE.
do YOU THINK RODERICK BRODY DID THIS?
well HE SAID HE DIDN'T BELIEVE US.
apparently HE RECONSIDERED.
well THAT'S HORRIBLE. A MAN IS DEAD.
Yeah, I KNOW.
and THAT'S A MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE.
and YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
prison SWIRLIES. NATALIE
prison SWIR
you DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW ABOUT PRISON SWIRLIES.
they're NOT EVEN TECHNICALLY REAL SWIRLIES.
you WERE RIGHT ABOUT KARMA.
it IS FANTASTIC. - NO, MR. MONK.
monk, NATALIE, THANKS FOR COMING.
I WAS DOWNSTAIRS DOING A LITTLE DUMPSTER DIVING.
can't FIND THE MURDER WEAPON.
there's A STEAK KNIFE MISSING FROM THAT SERVICE TRAY.
I GUESS HE TOOK IT WITH HIM.
so, WHAT DO YOU...
what DO YOU THINK?
you OKAY?
are YOU HAPPY?
I LOVE MY WORK. IS THAT A CRIME?
no. - I THINK THEY KNEW THE GUY.
know WHA
what? YOU KNOW THIS GUY?
Mm. - DON'T
don't KNOW HIM. - TECHNICALLY.
never MET HIM FACE-TO-FACE. - NEVER FORMALLY INTRODUCED.
sort OF.
we-- - WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HIM.
right.
you WERE FOLLOWING HIM?
I WONDER WHY.
well HE WAS SEEING A WOMAN. A MARRIED WOMAN.
and WE WERE FOLLOWING HER.
you WERE FOLLOWING THE WOMAN.
I WONDER WHY.
her HUSBAND HIRED US.
until YOU HEAR DIFFERENT, I WONDER WHY?
what? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
you're DOING DIVORCE WORK NOW?
no, HE WAS JUST DOING A FAVOR.
he WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF MR. MONK'S.
wouldn't EXACTLY SAY HE WAS A FRIEND.
more OF AN ACQUAINTANCE ACTUALLY.
he BEAT ME UP EVERY WEEK FOR THREE YEARS.
and THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE STUPID GRIN ON YOUR FACE.
you THINK YOU'RE GETTING EVEN.
I KNOW I'M GETTING EVEN.
so YOUR PAL,
you TOLD HIM ABOUT THE AFFAIR.
and YOU TOLD HIM THAT FENDLE WAS GONNA BE HERE.
well I THINK YOUR PAL JUST MADE THE TOP OF MY TO-DO LIST.
what's HIS NAME?
actually WE CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.
technically HE'S A CLIENT SO IT'S PRIVILEGED INFORMATION.
we COULD CONTACT A LAWYER OR A THIRD PARTY
23 ORCHARD CIRCLE.
no. B- R-O. THAT LOOKS LIKE AN A.
well LET'S GO TALK TO HIM.
prison SWIRLIES!
didn't HAVE TO DRAG ME DOWN HERE.
I COULD'VE TALKED TO YOU AT MY OFFICE.
well I'M MORE COMFORTABLE HERE.
I GOT MY OWN COFFEE MUG.
I GOT THE AC SET JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT.
Yeah, WELL CAN I AT LEAST CALL MY WIFE?
we've ALREADY CALLED HER. SHE'S ON HER WAY.
so LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING.
you KNEW MR. MONK FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
you HIRED HIM TO FOLLOW YOUR WIFE.
he TOLD YOU ABOUT MR. FENDLE.
told YOU ABOUT FENDLE AT THE HOTEL.
Yeah, BUT IT WASN'T MY WIFE.
the WOMAN YOU SAW IN THAT BAR.
it WASN'T MARILYN.
couldn't HAVE BEEN.
I TOLD YOU ABOUT YOUR WIFE AND MR. FENDLE.
and THEN TWO HOURS LATER, FENDLE WAS DEAD.
it LOOKS PRETTY BAD, RODDY.
um, SKIPPING AHEAD.
8: 00 LAST NIGHT?
I TOLD YOU.
I WAS HOME...WITH MARILYN.
we RENTED A MOVIE.
what's THE MATTER, RODDY?
you LOOK A LITTLE FLUSHED.
get IT? - NO.
neither DO I.
flushed?
he GETS IT. TRUST ME.
he GETS IT.
okay, UM...MONK.
we'll TAKE IT FROM HERE, OKAY? THANK YOU.
I BET THE ROOM IS JUST SWIRLING AROUND YOU RIGHT NOW, ISN'T IT?
it's SWIRLING ALL AROUND.
your WHOLE LIFE IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN THE DRAIN.
wait, I HAVE MORE.
your THOUGHTS ARE OVERFLOWING
just WAIT FOR MARILYN.
when SHE GETS HERE SHE'LL TELL YOU.
we WERE TOGETHER ALL NIGHT.
I NEVER LEFT HER SIDE.
I'm SORRY, BABY.
Oh, THANK GOD.
you GOTTA TELL THESE GUYS ABOUT WHAT WE DID LAST NIGHT.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
what YOU WANT ME TO SAY BUT I...
I CAN'T LIE FOR YOU AFTER WHAT YOU DID.
what?
the TRUTH IS THAT I...
I WAS IN LOVE WITH DOUG FENDLE.
last NIGHT,I TOLD RODERICK THE TRUTH.
I TRIED TO.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, MARILYN? - MR. BRODY, LET HER TALK.
what HAPPENED?
he GOT FURIOUS?
he SAID HE WAS GONNA KILL DOUG.
and THEN...HE LEFT.
what ARE YOU DOING-- - HEY, MR. BRODY!
what TIME WAS THIS?
um, 7: 30.
he LEFT FOR ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW, TWO HOURS.
and WHEN HE CAME BACK,
he WAS...BLOODY.
Marilyn! - MR. BRODY.
this IS RIDICULOUS! - TAKE HIM DOWN.
I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE'S SAYING THIS.
have A SIT, SIT DOWN! - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
it's OKAY. GO ON.
when I CAME DOWNSTAIRS,
Roderick WAS BY THE FIREPLACE.
he WAS BURNING HIS CLOTHES.
that IS TOTALLY INSANE! SHE'S LYING TO YOU!
sit DOWN.
he GAVE ME THIS.
told ME TO GET RID OF IT.
I'm GOING TO STEP OUTSIDE FOR A MOMENT.
a LITTLE FRESH AIR.
Mr. MONK, THERE YOU ARE.
what ARE YOU DOING? - SHH.
listen. YOU HEAR THAT?
birds. THEY'RE SINGING.
is THAT A LARK? YEAH?
uh, I DON'T KNOW.
you KNOW HOW I FEEL?
liberated.
I SHOULD'VE CONFRONTED THAT S. O. YOU-KNOW-WHAT YEARS AGO.
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE I WON.
Yeah, MR. MONK, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY REALLY WON ANYTHING.
you're RIGHT OF COURSE. YOU'RE RIGHT.
except ME.

I JUST CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY.
I've BEEN SITTING HERE FOR TWO HOURS WRECKING MY BRAIN.
racking YOUR BRAIN.
here's WHAT I KNOW, OKAY?
I KNOW I DIDN'T DO IT.
and I KNOW SHE DIDN'T DO IT 'CAUSE I WAS WITH HER ALL NIGHT.
where DID SHE GET...THE KNIFE.
I DON'T KNOW.
where DID SHE GET THE KNIFE?
I CAN'T FIGURE IT.
something's GOING ON HERE BUT I

Yeah.
it's A MIRROR.
Oh, MY GOD.

your WIFE.
last NIGHT SHE WAS AT THE HOTEL.

Yes.
and NO.
she WAS WITH YOU...
and SHE WAS AT THE HOTEL.
she WAS BOTH.
twins.
Hey, SIS.
how YOU FEELING?
those ARE SOME PRETTY STRONG TRANQUILIZERS I GAVE YOU.
you KNOW, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD A SISTER
until THAT-- THAT LAWYER DOUG FENDLE CAME KNOCKING.
his FIRM REPRESENTED OUR ADOPTION 35 YEARS AGO.
can YOU BELIEVE THAT?
and NOW...
you're WORTH WHAT?
$9-10 MILLION?
I NEVER EVEN HAD A SAVINGS ACCOUNT.
doesn't REALLY SEEM FAIR, DOES IT?
monk. UGH, YOU WERE RIGHT.
she HAS A TWIN SISTER.
a PATRICE GESNER.
they WERE ADOPTED BY DIFFERENT FAMILIES 35 YEARS AGO IN MILWAUKEE.
papers WERE SEALED. THEY NEVER KNEW EACH OTHER.
I THINK THEY'RE BOTH IN THERE.
you WANT TO LOOK AROUND?
not YET.
rodriquez IS GETTING A WARRANT.
he'll BE HERE SOON.
so IDENTICAL TWINS, HUH? THAT'S ONE FOR THE BOOKS.
Yeah, I'M PRETTY SURE I SAID TWINS.
Randy, YOU ALWAYS SAY TWINS.
you've BEEN DEPRESSED.
and YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING.
they're GONNA FIND YOUR BODY IN THE BAY NEAR THE BRIDGE.
the BAY IS SALT WATER
so I HAVE TO ADD THIS.
so HOW DID YOU KNOW?
little THINGS. THEY BEGAN TO ADD UP.
when I FIRST MET HER,
she MENTIONED HER AUNT IN TEXAS.
just ONE AUNT IN TEXAS. SHE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT.
she PRONOUNCED IT ANT.
this MORNING, SHE SAID:
my AUNT IS FLYING IN TOMORROW.
and THE FINGERNAILS.
two DAYS AGO, SHE WAS BITING THEM.
this MORNING THEY WERE LONG AND PERFECTLY MANICURED.
it's TIME FOR YOUR BATH, SIS.
this MIGHT HURT A LITTLE.
I WONDER IF I'LL FEEL IT.
probably NOT.
it's NOT LIKE YOU FELT MY PAIN FOR THE LAST 35 YEARS.
Roderick's WIFE WASN'T CHEATING ON HIM.
the WOMAN HE SAW LAST WEEK WAS HER SISTER.
Yeah, WE WEREN'T FOLLOWING MARILYN.
we WERE FOLLOWING HER TWIN.
this MORNING WHILE WE WERE ALL AT THE POLICE STATION,
the SISTER WAS HERE.
she WAS SWITCHING PLACES.
she WAS GONNA KILL RODERICK TOO
to GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY UNTIL WE ARRESTED HIM.
we JUST MADE HER JOB EASIER.
arrested?
I'll BE RIGHT THERE.
okay, WHY DID SHE KILL FENDLE?
FENDLE WAS HER PARTNER IN ALL THIS.
there WAS A BANKER HERE THIS MORNING.
she's BEEN MOVING RODERICK'S MONEY TO OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS.
funny THING IS YOU PROBABLY DON'T EVEN KNOW MY NAME.
it's PATRICE.
I THINK SHE'S PLANNING TO KILL MARILYN AND THEN DISAPPEAR.
Patrice, I BEG YOU.

I've talked with the police.
I mean, the real police. They stayed here for 3 hours.
I did not know the girl, never found the girl.
you were at her house, was looking for her.
I knew she was disappeared, I saw on the news.
they said they needed volunteers.
I was just fulfilling my civic obligations.
next time, I will not worry.
you gave police a false name.
yes I have four or five parking fines not paid.
if you want to hold me So feel free.

I did not understand. - This part of the floor, like it was clean.
excuse me, do not feel the desire with you snooping around.
certainly not feel.
I do not kill anybody, Mr. Monk.
it can not prove I killed. Can?
no, I can not.
I like his paintings. Do you go to art galleries?
I think it done here.

it was great to meet them.
just one more question, one curiosity, on the carpet.
what carpet? - This rug.
it looks brand new.
it's new.
steve bought last week while I was in London.
I could not have surprised me more.
it's about that missing girl?
poor. I told so as not to volunteer.
he thinks he can save the world alone.
I do not think we know. I'm Gwen.
what dog beautiful. Where's your tail?
he is an Australian shepherd.
they are born without a tail. Were created this way.
that makes it special, is not it?
I offer you a drink?
in fact, they already were leaving, honey.
I do not know their names.
no need. They will not return.
arrived.
there you are. How does it behave?
it was great.
Hi, there you are.

I love you too. I love you too.
thank you for taking care of her.
I like dogs. - Sure.
she did not eat?
she was not hungry.

someone tried to kill a Shelby?
maybe he was drunk. I was just making the turn.
no, no, no. It was deliberate.
he tried to run her over.
he was not interested in me, was certainly behind the Shelby.
maybe he does not like dogs.
how can anyone not like dogs?
what reason could anyone have to ...
I do not know!
I do not know, but should be connected to Amanda Castle.
she died a week and a half and tonight someone the dog tried to kill her can not be a coincidence.
was the man, Steven DeWitt?
you can not know. - What kind of car he was driving?
I do not know, I was ...so worried Shelby it has been strange, you see,
she did not eat all day.
maybe she witnessed the crime.
she saw the DeWitt kill Amanda and now is afraid that she identifies.
how? - She may bark at him.
Randy, to my knowledge, the State of California, dogs can not witness in a trial.
maybe he is afraid to change the law.
changing the law against dogs witness in a trial?
it is not know, one of those referendums. After all, is California.
want to know how tired I am?
I'm so tired that not know if that makes any sense.

Dewitt to show up help find the body.
he was making love in Shelby. Affection in your belly.
he noted that she was pregnant.
Dewitt had a problem.
he knew that as soon as we saw tailless pups, would do a DNA test.
we would have proof, living proof the dogs met.
this proves that he knew Amanda.
that's why he tried to drive over it tonight.
well, it seems we find the final proof.
and you're the showdown more fofinha history. Watch this.
jurors will worship you.
wait a minute, are coming more evidence.

Oh, it was a Christmas present mayor.
thank the mayor for me.
I think it ended.
I also finished. Randy, you're driving.

Yes, sir. - What do I do?
you'll get some sleep.
we went back to get you and dogs in the morning.
no, the puppies. What do I do?
Mr. Monk, you do not do anything. She knows what she is doing.
bye Shelby. Good work.
you have many things to explain, young lady.
you're late.
they were born.
what are you doing, Steven?
kill them all?
I think yes.
but I am a witness, then going to kill me too.
do not move. Stay where you are.
I do not think that is a killer.
I think you loved Amanda.
it was an accident! - I believe in you.
she fell and hit his head. - This is not murder.
it manslaughter perhaps obstruction ...
it's bad, but it gets worse.
not worse things.
not worse things.
it was an accident. - I know.
I know it was.
they are beautiful.
I know.

right. - Thank.
thank you.
we'll take care well it's a promise.
wait, wait.
I can not do this, I'm sorry.
I can not separate them, they need to stay together.
Mr. Monk, I know it hurts, and I know you're thinking in his own family, but with dogs is different.
it is no different, are a family, she is the mother, they need to be together.
here are the facts: There are 5 dogs here.
can not keep all. You're ... you.
I know, I know it's me.
how about this. We take them all.
Really? - The whole family.
even the mother.
we have 3 acres, all surrounded, they will love.
right. - Okay, great.
I'll get her things. Want to help?
yes - Right.
you can visit it whenever you want.

never alone again.
sleep tight, kiddo.

simulation terminated. Simulation terminated.
simulation terminated.
all right. Mr. Bile, is it?
my friends call me Phlegm.
Mr. Bile, can you tell me what you did wrong?
I fell down? - No, no, before that.
can anyone tell me Mr. Bile's big mistake?
anyone?
let's take a look at the tape. Here we go.
right there.
see? The door. You left it wide open.
and leaving the door open is the worst mistake any employee can make because...
eh. It could let in a draft?
it could let in a child.
Oh. Mr. Waternoose.
there's nothing more toxic or deadly than a human child.
a single touch could kill you.
leave a door open and a child could walk right into this factory, right into the monster world.
I won't go in a kid's room. You can't make me.
you're going in there because we need this.
our city is counting on you to collect those children's screams.
without scream we have no power.
Yes, it's dangerous work.
and that's why I need you to be at your best.
I need scarers who are confident, tenacious, tough...and intimidating.
I need scarers like... like James P. Sullivan.
Hey, good morning, Monstropolis. It's five after the hour of 6: 00 a. m.
in the big Monster City.
the temperature's a balmy 65 degrees which is good news for you reptiles.
and it looks like it's gonna be a perfect day to maybe, hey, lie in bed, sleep in, or simply work out that flab that's hanging over the bed!
get up, Sulley!
I don't believe I ordered a wake-up call, Mikey.
less talk, more pain, marshmallow boy!
feel the burn. You call yourself a monster?
scary feet, scary feet, scary feet. The kid's awake!
scary feet, scary feet, scary feet. Kid's asleep!
twins! In a bunk bed!
I thought I had you there.
OK, Sulley, here we go. You ready? Follow it. It's over here.
over there. Don't let the kid touch you. Don't let him touch you!
I don't know but it's been said I love scarin' kids in bed.
come on. Fight that plaque, fight that plaque.
scary monsters don't have plaque.
One-eighteen. Do you have 119?
do I see 120?
Oh. I don't believe it. - I'm not breaking a sweat.
not you. Look! The new commercial's on.
the future is bright at Monsters, Incorporated.
I'm in this one, I'm in this one. - We're part of your life.
we power your car. We warm your home.
we light your city.
I'm Monsters, Incorporated. - Hey, look! Betty!
carefully matching every child to their ideal monster, to produce superior scream.
refined into clean, dependable energy.
every time you turn something on, Monsters, Incorporated is there.
I'm Monsters, Incorporated. - We know the challenge.
the window of innocence is shrinking.
human kids are harder to scare.
of course, MI is prepared for the future.
with the top scarers, the best refineries, and research into new energy techniques.
OK, here I come.
we're working for a better tomorrow, today.
we're Monsters, Incorporated.
we're MI, Monsters, Incorporated.
we scare because we care.
I can't believe it. - Oh Mike.
I was on TV!
did you see me? I'm a natural.
Hello? I know! Wasn't I great?
did the whole family see it? It's your mom.
haha... what can I say? The camera loves me.
I'm telling you, Big Daddy, you're gonna be seeing this face on TV more often.
yeah? On the Monstropolis' Most Wanted?
you've been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade.
have a good day, sweetie. - You too, hon.
OK, Sulley, hop on in. - Nope.
Hey, hey, hey, where you going, where you going?
Mikey, there's a scream shortage.
we're walking. - Walking?
Yep - No, no. - Come on.
my baby, look, he needs to be driven.
my baby. I'll call you.
Hey, you wanna know why I bought the car? - Not really.
to drive it.
you know, like on the street with the honk-honk and the vroom-vroom - no walking involved. - Give it a rest, will ya, butterball?
come on. You could use the exercise.
I could use the exercise? Look at you.
you, you have your own climate.
how many tentacles jump the rope?
morning, Mike. Morning, Sulley.
morning, kids. How you doing?
Bye, Mike. Bye, Sulley. - Hey!
nuts.
Hey, hey, hey. Fellas. - Hey, Tony.
Hey. Tony, Tony.
I hear somebody's close to breaking the all-time scare record.
just trying to make sure there's enough scream to go around.
Hey, on the house. - Hey, thanks.
bada-bing.
Oh, great.
Hey, Ted, good morning.
see that, Mikey? Ted's walking to work.
no big deal. This guy takes five steps and he's there.
monsters, Inc. Please hold.
monsters, Inc. Please hold. Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
mornin', Sulley. - Mornin', Ricky.
it's the Sullster. - See you on the scare floor. Buddy.
hey Marge. How was jury duty? - Morning, Sulley.
Hey.
Hey. It's still leaning to the left.
it is not. - Hey, fellas. Hey, Jerry.
morning.
Hey, Mr. Sullivan. - Guys, I told you, call me Sulley.
I don't think so. - We just want to wish you good luck today.
Hey, hey, come on, get lost, you two. You're making him lose his focus.
sorry. - See you later, fellas.
go get 'em, Mr. Sullivan.
quiet. You're making him lose his focus.
Oh, no. Sorry! - Shut up!
monsters, Inc. Please hold. Monsters, Inc. I'll connect you.
miss Fearmonger is on vacation. Would you like her voicemail?
schmoopsie-pooh. - Googly bear.
happy birthday. - Googly-woogly, you remembered.
Hey, Sulley-wulley. - Hey, Celia-wheelia.
happy birthday. - Thanks.
so are we going anywhere special tonight?
I just got us into a little place called Harryhausen's.
Harryhausen's? But it's impossible to get a reservation there.
not for googly bear. I will see you at quittin' time.
not a minute later. - OK, sweetheart.
think romantical thoughts.
# You and me. Me and you #
# Both of us together #
you know, pal, she's the one.
that's it. She is the one. - I'm happy for you.
thanks for hooking me up with those reservations.
no problem. They're under the name "googly bear.
good ide... You know, that wasn't very funny.
what the... - Wazowski.
what do you know?
it scares little kids and little monsters.
I wasn't scared. I have allergies.
sure. - Hey, Randall, save it for the scare floor, will ya?
I'm in the zone today, Sullivan. Gonna do serious scaring.
putting up some big numbers. - Wow, Randall, that's great.
that should make it more humiliating when we break the record first. Ha ha.
do you hear that? It's the winds of change.
you hear that? It's the winds of...
what a creep. One of these days I am really gonna let you teach that guy a lesson.
Chalooby. Baby.
good morning, Roz, my succulent little garden snail.
who would we be scaring today? - Wazowski.
you didn't file your paperwork last night.
Oh, that darn paperwork.
wouldn't it be easier if it all just blew away?
don't let it happen again.
Yes. Well, I'll try to be less careless.
I'm watching you, Wazowski.
always watching.
she's nuts. - Always.
all scare floors are now active.
assistants, please report to your stations.
OK, people, Eastern Seaboard coming online.
we got scarers coming out.
Oooh. They are so awesome.
Hey, may the best monster win.
I plan to.
we are on in seven, six, five, four, three, two...
you're the boss, you're the boss. You're the big hairy boss.
I'm feeling good today, Mikey.
attaboy, attaboy. Another door coming right up.
you're still behind, Randall.
maybe I should realign the scream... - Just get me another door.
the door, yes, door.
well, Jerry, what's the damage so far?
we may actually make our quota today, sir.
first time in a month.
what happened? - The kid almost touched me.
she got this close to me. - She wasn't scared of you?
she was only six. - I could have been dead.
I could have died. - Keep it together, man.
Hey, we got a dead door over here.
I'm coming. - Look out.
excuse us.
we've lost 58 doors this week, sir.
kids these days.
they just don't get scared like they used to.
let her rip.
sir? - What?
look.
attention. We have a new scare leader.
Randall Boggs.
look at those numbers.
slumber party.
never mind.
Hey, watch it.
well, James, that was an impressive display.
no. Just doing my job, Mr. Waternoose.
course I did learn from the best.
if I don't see a new door in my station in five seconds,
I will personally put you through the shredder.
Hey, Wazowski, nice job. Those numbers are pretty sweet.
are they? You know, I hadn't even noticed.
and how's Georgie doing? - He's doing great.
I love working with that big guy.
keep the doors coming, Charlie. I'm on a roll today.
george and I are like brothers. 2319!
we have a 2319!
red alert.
red alert, red alert.
red alert. - George Sanderson.
please remain motionless. Prepare for decontamination.
duck and cover, people!
Oh. Not the CDA.
go, go, go. - Coming through. Stand aside.
clear the contaminated area. - No.
a 2319 in progress. - Area Clear. Coming through. Watch yourself.
stand back. Careful.
all clear. Situation is niner-niner-zero. Ready for decon.
Thanks, guys, that was a close one. - OK.
OK, people. Take a break.
we gotta shut down for half hour and reset the system.
an entire scare floor out of commission.
what else can go wrong?
what a day. - We're just going through a rough time, sir.
everyone knows you'll get us through it.
tell that to the board of directors.
James, this company's been in my family for three generations.
I would do anything to keep it from going under.
so would I, sir.
I could use your help with something. - Anything, sir.
you see, we've hired some new scare recruits, and frankly, they're... eh... they're - Inexperienced? - No, they stink.
I thought maybe you might come by tomorrow and give them a demonstration.
show them what it takes to be our top scarer.
I'll start out with the old Waternoose jump and growl.
now that's my boy.
let's go, everybody. All doors must be returned.
no exceptions.
I've never seen anything like you today. You were on a roll, my man.
another day like this and that scare record's in the bag.
that's right, baby.
Lets's get this. As if dinner wasn't enough,
I'm taking her to a monster truck rally afterwards.
nice. - What's on your agenda?
I'm going home. Work out some more. - Again?
you know, there's more to life than scaring.
can I borrow your odorant?
Yeah, I got smelly garbage or old dumpster.
you got low tide? How about wet dog?
Yep. Stink it up.
you know, I am so romantic sometimes I think I should just marry myself.
give me a break. - What a night of romance got ahead of me.
tonight is about me and Celia.
the love boat is about to set sail.
cause I gotta tell you, buddy, that face of hers, it just makes my heart go...
Hello, Wazowski. Fun-filled evening planned for tonight?
well, as a matter of fact...
and I'm sure you filed your paperwork correctly, for once.
your stunned silence is very reassuring.
Oh, no. My scare reports. I left them on my desk.
if I'm not at the restaurant in five minutes they'll give our table away. What am I gonna do?
schmoopsie-pooh. - Hey, googly bear.
want to get going? - Do I ever... It's just...
what? - OK, it's...
it's just a small... - I don't understand.
it's just I forgot about some paperwork I was supposed to file.
Mike was reminding me.
Thanks, buddy. - I was?
I mean, I was. Yeah. I was.
OK. Let's go. - We're going.
on my desk, Sulley. The pink copies to accounting.
the fuchsia ones go to purchasing and the goldenrod ones go to Roz
leave the puce.
pink copies to accounting, fuchsia ones to Roz.
no. The fuchsia ones go to purchasing.
the goldenrod ones go to Roz.
man, I have no idea what puce is.
Oh, that's puce.
Hello?
anyone? There's a door here.
Hello? Hey.
anybody scaring in here?
hello. Yo.
Kitty.
no, no, stay back.
hold it, hold it.
Oh, Michael, I've had a lot of birthdays... Well, not a lot of birthdays.
but this is the best birthday ever.
what are you looking at?
I was just thinking about the first time I laid eye on you, - how pretty you looked. - Stop it.
your hair was shorter. - I'm thinking about getting it cut.
no, no, I like it this length.
I like everything about you.
just the other day someone asked me who I thought the most beautiful monster was in Monstroplis.
you know what I said? - What did you say?
I said...
Sulley? - Sulley?
no, no, that's not what I was gonna say.
you're not making sense.
he's handsome. He's rugged. - What a coincidence, running into you.
I'm just gonna order something to go. - Michael.
what's good here? - Get out of here. You're ruining everything.
I went to get your paperwork and there was a door.
what?
a door? - Randall was in it.
wait a minute. Randall? That cheater. He's trying to boost his numbers.
there's something else. - What?
what? - Look in the bag.
what bag?
they don't have anything I like here. But take care, Celia.
what's going on? - Celia, please try to understand.
I have to do something! - Michael?
on three. One, two...
a kid! - Boo!
a kid!
there's a kid here. A human kid!
googly bear!
come on.
let's get out of here.
please remain calm. This is not a drill.
7835 in progress, please advise.
Michael? Michael! - Celia!
please come with me. - Stop pushing.
Hey. Get your hands off my schmoopsie-pooh.
area clear. Ready for decontamination.
I don't think that date could have gone any worse.
if witnesses are to be believed, there has been a child security breach for the first time in monster history.
we can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here tonight.
well, a kid flew right over me and blasted a car with its laser vision.
I tried to run from it, but it picked me up with its mind powers and shook me like a doll.
it's true. I saw the whole thing.
it is my professional opinion that now is the time to panic.
it's coming. It's coming!
Boo!
no, no, no, no!
come here, kid.
don't touch those, you little...
those were alphabetized. It's OK. It's all right
as long as it doesn't come near us we're gonna be OK.
you like this? Fetch.
Hey, hey. That's it. No one touches Little Mikey.
Mike, give her the bear.
Oh, no!
make it stop, Sulley. Make it stop!
here, look. See bear? Nice bear.
Sulley!
bear, he's a happy bear.
he's not crying, neither should you. Or we'll be in trouble 'cause they're gonna find us, so please stop crying now. Right now
good. Good, Sulley. Keep it up. You're doing great.
he's a happy bear. He has no...
it touched me. - Sulley, the bear!
the bear. Give her the...
what was that?
I have no idea, but it would be really great if it didn't do it again.
how could I do this? How could I be so stupid?
this could destroy the company.
the company? Who cares about the company?
what about us? That thing is a killing machine.
I bet it's just waiting for us to fall asleep and then wham!
we're easy prey, my friend. Easy prey. We're sitting targets.
OK, look, I think I have a plan here.
using mainly spoons, we dig a tunnel under the city and release it into the wild.
spoons.
that's it. I'm out of ideas. we are closed. Air balloon, too expensive.
giant slingshot, too conspicuous. Enormous wooden horse, too Greek.
no. Can't think. Can't think.
flatliner. Flatlining. - Mike?
I think she's getting tired.
well, then why don't you find someplace for it to sleep while I think of a plan!
are you sleepy? Wanna sleep?
is that what you want?
OK. I'll make a nice little area for you to...
no. Hey, that's my bed. You're gonna get your germs all over it.
fine. My chair's more comfortable anyway.
what?
it's just a closet. Will you go to sleep?
Hey, that looks like Randall.
Randall's your monster.
you think he's gonna come through the closet and scare you.
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?
it's empty.
see?
no monster in here.
well, now there is.
but I'm not gonna scare you.
I'm off duty.
OK.
how about I sit here until you fall asleep?
go ahead. Go to sleep.
now. Now go.
you go to sleep.
Mike, this might sound crazy, but I don't think that kid's dangerous.
Really? Well, in that case, let's keep it.
I always wanted a pet that could kill me!
now, look, what if we just put her back in her door?
what? - Mike, think about it.
we send her back just like it never happened, everything goes back to normal.
is that a joke? Tell me you're joking.
Sulley, I think that given the circumstances
I've been extremely forgiving up to now.
but that is a horrible idea.
what are we gonna do? March in public with that thing?
then I guess we just walk right up to the factory, right?
I can't believe we are waltzing right up to the factory.
Sulley, a mop, a couple of lights and some chair fabric are not gonna fool anyone. Just think about a few names.
Loch Ness. Bigfoot. The Abominable Snowman.
they all got one thing in common, pal. Banishment!
we could be next. - Don't panic. We can do this.
Hey, how you doing, Frank? - Hey, guys.
everything's going to be OK.
number one wants this place dusted for prints.
careful with that. - I got a good view from here.
a little lower.
this was recovered at the scene.
don't panic. Don't panic. - Don't tell me not to panic.
just keep it together. - It's not OK.
boo. - Could be contaminated.
gentlemen, safety is our number-one concern.
if there's anything that... Not now. I'm...
Oh, hello, little one.
where did you come from? - Mr. Waternoose!
aha, James, is this one yours?
actually, that's my cousin's sister's - daughter, sir. - Yeah, it's...
bring an Obscure Relative to Work Day.
must have missed the memo. Well, listen, James, why don't you stop by the simulator after lunch today and give us that scare demonstration we talked about?
Yeah. Oh, sir...
Mr. Waternoose? - Yes, yes. I'm coming.
I'll see you this afternoon, James.
that is, if these gentlemen haven't shut us down.
Oh, boy. - A scare demo.
that is great. Why am I the last to know?
we could bring your cousin's sister's daughter along. She'll be a big hit.
halt.
hold him down.
come on. The coast is clear.
OK. All we have to do is get rid of that thing.
so wait here while I get its card key.
she can't stay here. This is the men's room.
that is the weirdest thing you've ever said.
it's fine. It's OK. Look. It loves it here. It's dancing with joy.
I'll be right back with its door key.
that's a cute little dance. It almost looks like you've got to...
are you done in there?
sorry, sorry.
OK. You're finished now, right?
Hello?
boo.
where did she go?
did she disappear?
did she turn invisible?
I just have no idea.
gotcha.
boo.
Hey, you're good.
be relaxed. Be relaxed. Be relaxed.
Roz, my tender oozing blossom. You're looking fabulous today.
is that a new haircut? Come on, tell me, it's a new haircut, isn't it?
it's got to be new makeup. You had a lift. You had a tuck. You had something.
something has been inserted in your skin that makes you look like...
listen, I need a favor. Randall was working late last night on the scare floor.
I really need the key for the door he was using.
well, isn't that nice?
but guess what? You didn't turn in your paperwork last night.
he didn't... I... No paperwork?
this office is now closed.
ready or not, here I come.
I'm getting warmer.
any second now.
fee, fi, fo... - What are you doing?
I'm looking for the kid.
you lost it? - No, no. She was just...
here she is.
Hey. What's the matter?
I already told your buddies... - All right. Carry on.
Randall. Thank goodness. What are we gonna do about the child?
the front page. It's on the front page. The child. The one you were after.
will you be quiet? Don't you think I'm aware of the situation?
I was up all night trying to find it.
I did a simple calculation factoring in the size of the sushi restaurant.
the child may have escaped!
until we know for sure we're gonna act like nothing happened. Understand?
you will just get the machine up and running. I'll take care of the kid.
when I find whoever let it out, they're dead.
why are you still here? Come on, go! Move! Now!
I'm not here.
they're gone.
this is bad, it's so very bad.
what were they talking about, machine?
who cares?
look, don't panic. All we have to do is call her door and send her home.
you are right. You are right. We're just two regular Joes on our way to work.
we will blend right in.
top of the morning, fellows. - What's shakin', bacon?
did you lose weight? Or a limb?
you have her card key, right? - Of course. I have her card key
I told you I'd get her card key. I went and got her card key.
now I have her card key.
OK. Here we go.
take care of yourself. Try not to run through any more closets.
Mike, that's not her door.
what are you talking about? Of course it's her door. It's her door.
no. Her door was white and it had flowers on it.
no. It must have been dark last night because this is its door.
Hey, you hear that? Sounds like fun in there.
OK. Send me a postcard, kid. That's Mike Wazowski, care of 22 Mike Wazowski, you-got-your-life-back Lane.
very good. Now bon voyage.
Bye-bye. Come on. Look at the stick. See the stick? Go get the stick.
go fetch. - Mike, this isn't Boo's door.
boo? What's Boo? - That's what I decided to call her.
there a problem?
Sulley, you're not supposed to name it.
once you name it, you start getting attached to it.
now put that thing back where it came from, or so help me...
Hey. We're rehearsing a scene for the upcoming company play called...
put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me.
it's a musical.
# Put that thing back where it came from or so help me #
# So help me, so help me #
and cut.
we're still working on it. It's in progress, but we need ushers.
Sulley, I've had enough. Say goodbye to... Where did it go? What did you do?
where is she? - I don't believe it. She got away from you again?
well, that is just... Wait a minute. The sun is coming up.
this is perfect.
she's gone!
where are you going? Sulley, please, don't blow this.
we're so close to breaking the record.
somebody else will find the kid. It'll be their problem. Not ours.
she's out of our hair!
what are you two doing? - They're rehearsing a play.
# She's out of our hair #
Mike Wazowski! So, what do you think of that kid getting out, Sullivan?
pretty crazy? - Oh, yeah, crazy.
word on the street is the kid's been traced back to this factory.
you haven't seen anything? - Well...
no. No way.
but if it was an inside job, I'd put my money on Waxford.
Waxford? - The one at station six.
he's got them shifty eyes. - Hey, Waxford.
Sulley! - Michael Wazowski!
last night was one of the worst nights of my entire life, bar none!
I thought you cared about me. - Honey, please.
I thought you liked sushi. - Sushi! Sushi!
you think this is about sushi?
Wazowski.
Michael!
men.
breathe. Keep breathing.
Where's the kid? - Kid?
what kid? - It's here in the factory, isn't it?
you are not putting this on me.
it never would have gotten out if you hadn't been cheating last night.
cheating? Cheating. Right.
OK. I think I know how to make this all go away.
what happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?
I get a timeout? - Everyone goes to lunch.
which means the scare floor will be...
painted? - Empty.
it'll be empty, you idiot.
you see that clock?
when the big hand is pointing up and the little hand is pointing up, the kid's door will be in my station.
but when the big hand points down, the door will be gone.
you have until then to put the kid back.
get the picture?
Boo!
no. - Hey, you. Halt.
he's the one.
the one from the commercial. - That's him.
can we get an autograph? - Oh, sure. No problem.
make that out to Stephanie, my daughter.
Yes. Let's see.
from your scary friend. Best wishes...
so, then I said, "If you talk to me like that again, we're through."
What'd she say? - You know my mom.
she sent me to my room. - See you guys later. Take it easy.
bottoms up.
Boo!
Hi.
well, hello, there. What's your name?
Mike Wazowski.
Sulley!
Oh, Sulley.
OK, Sulley, come on.
Hey! You guys seen Sulley anywhere?
Nope, sorry. - Sulley!
boy, Wazowski looks like he's in trouble.
2319! We have a 2319!
Oh, dear.
Sulley!
Sulley!
Sulley. Great news, pal.
I got us a way out of this mess, but we gotta hurry.
where is it?
sull, that's a cube of garbage.
I can still hear her little voice.
Mike Wazowski. - I can hear it too.
Mike Wazowski! - How many kids you got in there?
Mike Wazowski!
Kitty! - Boo!
boo, you're all right. I was so worried. I was...
don't you ever run away from me again, young lady.
but I'm so glad you're safe.
my, what an affectionate father.
actually, she's my cousin's sister's...
Ok，Sulley. That's enough. Let's go. - Mike Wazowski.
Yeah. Step aside, kid. We're in a...
will you stop making Boo laugh? - I didn't. Come on.
I still don't understand. You got Boo's door?
I'll explain later. Run.
OK. Let's move, let's move let's move. Come on. Please be there. Please be there please be there.
there it is, just like Randall said. - Randall?
wait a minute. Boo, hey.
one, two, three, four, get the kid through the door. We are gonna get our lives back.
the nightmare is over. What's the matter? - It's OK, Boo.
it's time to move. - Mike, what are you thinking?
we can't trust Randall. Randall's after Boo. - Who cares? Let's go.
this is a limited-time offer. - No. I don't like this.
look, Sulley, you wanted her door and there it is.
now let's move. - No, Mike.
you want me to prove everything's on the up and up? Fine.
he wants a door, I get a door. - Wait.
paranoid delusional furball.
Mike!
Hey, Sulley, where you been all day?
Sulley? Sulley!
Mike? Mike?
where are you?
are you in there?
where are you, buddy?
Mike?
where are you?
boo, way to go.
it's OK.
Randall, did you have to...
Yes! I got the kid. - Oh, huzzah!
great news. Not that I was concerned. - Get over here and help me.
come on, while we're young here, Fungus.
the kid needs to take off a few pounds.
Wazowski! Where is it, you little one-eyed cretin?
it's cretin. If you're gonna threaten me, do it properly.
second, you're nuts if you think kidnapping me is gonna help you cheat your way to the top!
you still think this is about that stupid scare record?
well, I did.
right up until you chuckled like that.
now I think I should get out of here.
I'm about to revolutionize the scaring industry.
when I do, even the great James P. Sullivan is gonna be working for me.
well, somebody's certainly been a busy bee.
first I need to know where the kid is and you're gonna tell me.
I don't know anything. - Sure.
I don't. I don't.
what's that? Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
come on. No, no. Come on. Hey, hey.
Hey, hey. This thing is moving.
I don't like big moving things that are moving towards me.
no. Come on. Hey!
Randall! - Say hello to the scream extractor.
hello.
come on. Where you going? We'll talk. Come on. We'll have a latte.
come on. We can talk about this.
what is that thing?
wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
no. Come on.
help. Help! Help, help!
Oh, for... What did you do wrong this time?
I don't know. I calibrated the... - Go check the machine.
there must be something wrong with the scream intake valve.
fungus? Fungus? You like cars?
cuz I got a really nice car. If you let me go, I'll give you a ride in the car. Please, Fungus.
I'm sorry, Wazowski, but Randall said I'm not allowed to fraternize with victims of his evil plot.
what happened? Where's Wazowski?
where is he?
come on. - This is crazy. He's gonna kill us.
that could be contaminated.
we gotta get out of here now!
we could start a whole new life somewhere far away. Goodbye, Monsters, Inc.
goodbye, Mr. Waternoose.
no, Mike, wait. - Hey, what are you doing?
follow me. I have an idea. - No, no, no, no, no.
simulation terminated. - No, no, no, no, no.
what was that? You're trying to scare the kid, not lull it to sleep.
I was going for a snake/ninja approach with a little hissing.
how many times do I have to tell you? It's all about presence.
about how you enter the room. - Mr. Waternoose!
James, perfect timing.
no, no, sir. You don't understand.
show these monsters how it's done. - I can't.
sir, you have to listen to me. - Pay attention. Everyone
you're about to see the best in the business.
reset the simulator. - But sir!
good night, sweetheart. - Night, Mom.
Kitty! - No, Boo, no!
give us a big loud roar. - There's no time for this!
come on. What are you waiting for? Roar. - But, sir...
roar!
well done. Well done, James.
boo? - All right, gentlemen.
right this way. - I hope you've learned a lesson today.
boo.
boo.
boo, it's me.
the child! - Sir, she isn't toxic.
I konw it sounds crazy, but trust me. - Boo?
no, no, no, no, it's OK.
I was just... No.
no, don't be scared. That wasn't real.
it's just a... I was just...
boo. - Test it out on that sweet little girl.
boo. - Have her, he is trying to kill us.
this whole thing is Randall's fault. - Randall?
Yes. And we can take you to his secret lab which is right here in this factory.
how could this happen? How could this happen?
does anyone else know about this?
no, sir. - Good.
this company can't afford any more bad publicity.
now, before we do anything else, let's take care of the child.
I never thought things would come to this.
not in my factory.
I'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this.
especially you, James.
but now we can set everything straight again.
for the good of the company.
sir? That's not her door.
I know, I know.
it's yours.
No!
Boo!
No! No! No, no, no, no!
it's too late. We're banished, genius!
we're in the human world.
what a great idea, going to your old pal Waternoose.
too bad he was in on the whole thing.
all you had to do was listen to me.
just once! But you didn't, did you?
you're still not listening!
take that!
welcome to the Himalayas.
abominable. Can you believe that?
do I look abominable to you?
why can't they call me the Adorable Snowman or the Agreeable Snowman, for crying out loud?
I'm a nice guy. Snow cone?
no, don't worry. It's lemon.
how about you, big fella? Snow cone?
did you see the way she looked at me?
poor guy. I understand. It ain't easy being banished.
take my buddy, Bigfoot.
when he was banished, he fashioned an enormous diaper out of poison ivy.
wore it on his head like a tiara.
called himself King Itchy. It won't be so hard for you guys thougn.
how lucky can you get?
banished with your best friend. - He is not my friend.
I just assumed you were buddies, you know. When I saw you in the snow hugging...
look at that big jerk. Ruined my life. And for what?
a stupid kid!
because of you I am now stuck in this frozen wasteland.
wasteland? I think you mean wonderland.
how about all this fabulous snow?
and wait till you see the local village.
cutest thing in the world. I haven't mentioned the free yaks' milk.
what did you say? - Yaks' milk.
milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic.
once you pick the hairs out it's nutritious.
no, something about a village. Are there kids in it?
kids? Sure. Tough kids, sissy kids, kids who climb on rocks.
where is it? - At the bottom of the mountain.
around three-day hike. - Three days?
we need to get there now.
you wanna go to the village?
rule number one out here, always... No.
never go out in a blizzard.
we need to get to Boo.
boo? What about us?
ever since the kid came in, you've ignored everything I've said, and now look where we are! We were about to break the record, Sulley.
we would have had it made. - None of that matters now.
none of it matters? Wait a second.
none of it matters?
OK. No, good. Great.
so now the truth comes out, doesn't it?
would you look at that? We're out of snow cones.
let me just go outside and make some more.
Sulley, what about everything we ever worked for?
does that matter?
what about Celia?
I am never... never gonna see her again.
doesn't that matter?
and what about me?
I'm your pal. I'm your best friend.
don't I matter?
I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
but Boo's in trouble.
I think there might be a way to save her if we can just get...
we? Whoa. We?
no. There's no "we" this time, pal.
if you want to go out there and freeze to death, you be my guest.
because you're on your own.
Hey, I got more snow cones!
come on, George. I know you can do this.
I picked out an easy door for you.
in Nepal. Nice, quiet Nepal.
you know, you're right. Here. Take this.
go get 'em, Georgie.
look out. Coming through.
sorry, George. - Hey, you can't just...
Twenty-three...
out of the way!
finally. I never should have trusted you with this.
because of you, I had to banish my top scarer.
with this machine, we won't need scarers.
Sullivan got what he deserved.
Sullivan was twice the scarer you will ever be.
Kitty!
Kitty! - Sullivan?
Kitty! - Sorry, Boo.
stop him!
let's get you home.
finish him off!
you don't know how long I've wanted to do that, Sullivan.
Mike?
it's not that I don't care. - Mike, you don't understand.
Yes, I do. I was just mad, that's all.
I needed some time to think, but you shouldn't have left me out there.
I'm being attacked. - I'm not attacking you.
I'm trying to be honest. Hear me out. You and I are a team.
nothing is more important than our friendship.
I know. He's too sensitive.
come on, pal. If you start crying, I'm gonna cry.
and I'll never get through this.
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, but I am now.
Sulley, I am baring my soul here. The least you can do is pay attention.
look at that. It's Randall.
come on.
get up. There can't be any witnesses.
there won't be.
I'm glad you came back, Mike.
somebody's gotta take care of you, you big hairball.
Schmoopsie-pooh, I really can't talk. - Come on.
Michael, if you don't tell me what's going on right now, we are through! You hear me? Through!
here's the truth.
you know the kid that they're looking for? Sulley let her in.
we tried to send her back, but Waternoose had this secret plot, and now Randall's right behind us and trying to kill us!
you expect me to believe that pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?
Mike Wazowski.
I love you, schmoopsie-pooh!
Hey! - Idiots.
look out. Coming through.
make way. Move it. Hurry up, hurry up.
there they are. - Attention, employees.
Randall Boggs has just broken the all-time scare record.
no, I didn't. Get out of my way.
go get 'em, googly bear.
there it is.
get off my tail. Let go.
what are you doing? - Grab on, Mike.
are you out of your mind?
Sulley, what are we doing? - Get Boo's door and find a station.
what a plan. Simple, yet insane.
whoa. - Oh, boy.
hold on!
don't look down!
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh, no.
No!
Boo's door. - There it is.
how are we supposed to get to it now?
it's a dead end, Sulley.
there he is. - Make her laugh.
Sulley! - Just do it!
get it open. - Here he comes.
give me that kid.
why couldn't we get banished here? - We gotta find another door.
look! Boo's door.
there he is. Hurry up! - Give me your hand.
come on, it slides. - Right. Right.
jump. I'm right behind you.
come on.
hurry up. Keep moving!
get inside.
that was weird.
Mike?
sorry, buddy. - OK.
I hope that hurt, lizard boy.
great job, buddy. We lost him.
Boo!
No!
nice working with you.
get it open! - I'm trying!
open the door! - Come on, get in here.
Boo!
there they are!
Sulley, what are you doing? Sulley!
looks like we caught the express. - Do you see them?
straight ahead.
Kitty. - Boo.
look at everybody's favorite scarer now.
you stupid, pathetic waste.
you've been number one for too long, Sullivan. Now your time is up.
and don't worry. I'll take good care of the kid.
No!
she's not scared of you anymore.
looks like you're out of a job.
OK, over the plate. Let's see the old stuff.
Chuck him, baby.
here's the pitch and he is out of here.
mama, another gator got in the house. - Another gator?
give me that shovel. There!
get him, Mama. Get that gator.
care to do the honors, Mikey? - With pleasure.
that's right, Boo. You did it.
you beat him.
come on.
OK, Boo, it's time to go home.
take care of yourself and be a good girl, OK?
Oh, no. - The power's out. Make her laugh.
all right. I got a move here that'll bring down the house.
sorry. She didn't see that. - What?
what, did you forget to check if her hood was up, you big dope?
uncle Mike, try not to yell in front of her.
you know we need her to laugh. - Right.
Hey, Boo. Just kidding. Look.
funny, right? See, with the...
these are the jokes, kid. What's happening?
hold on.
when the door lands in the station, cut the power.
you'll have the child and the criminals responsible for this whole mess.
great. A welcoming committee. What are we gonna do?
this is the CDA. Come out slowly with the child in plain sight.
OK, OK, you got us.
here we are. Here's the kid.
I'll cooperate, but before you take us away, I have one thing to say.
catch. - 2319.
we have a toxic projectile.
after the suspect. - Stop him!
come on. - Don't let them get away.
wait. Come back. He has the child.
Sullivan. Sullivan!
give me the child. Give her to me!
open this door. Open this door!
stop it.
don't do it.
come on. - Don't go in that room.
I think we stopped him, Boo. You're safe now.
you be a good girl, OK?
this has gone far enough, James. - She's home. Leave her alone.
I can't do that. She's seen too much.
you both have. - It doesn't have to be this way.
I have no choice. Times have changed.
scaring isn't enough anymore. - But kidnapping?
I'll kidnap 1, 000 children before I let the company die.
and I'll silence anyone who gets in my way!
No!
night, Mom. - Night, sweetheart.
night, Mom. - What is this?
simulation terminated. Simulation terminated.
well, I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I spotted several big mistakes.
but how did...
you know what? Let's watch my favorite part again. Shall we?
I'll kidnap 1, 000 children before I let this company die.
I'll kidnap 1, 000 children before I let this company die.
I'll kidnap 1, 000 children before I let this company die.
come with us. - What are you doing?
take your hands off. You can't arrest me.
I hope you're happy, Sullivan. You destroyed this company.
monsters, Incorporated is dead! Where will everyone get their scream?
the energy crisis will only get worse because of you!
stay where you are. Number one wants to talk to you.
attention.
Hello, boys.
Roz? - Roz?
two and a half years of undercover work were almost wasted when you intercepted that child, Mr. Sullivan.
of course, without your help,
I never would have known that this went all the way up to Waternoose.
now, about the girl.
I just want to send her home.
very good.
bring me a door shredder. - What? You mean...
you mean I can't see her again?
that's the way it has to be.
I'll give you five minutes.
well, so long, kid. - Mike Wazowski.
Yeah.
boo.
it's been fun.
go ahead. Go grow up.
but, Boo...
boo.
look at that. You know...
that's cute. Yeah.
boo...
well, that's very nice.
come here, you!
Oh, he's a happy bear
nothing's coming out of your closet to scare you anymore, right?
Yeah.
goodbye, Boo.
Kitty.
Kitty has to go.
boo.
Kitty?
none of this ever happened, gentlemen.
and I don't want to see any paperwork on this.
take him away.
I bet we get the rest of the day off.
you idiot. They're gonna shut down the factory.
when that wall went up, you should have seen Waternoose's face.
I hope we get a copy of that tape.
are you all right?
come on, pal. Cheer up. We did it!
we got Boo home.
sure, we put the factory in the toilet and hundreds of people will be out of work.
not to mention the mob that will come after us when there's no power, but at least we had some laughs, right?
laughs.
is this thing on? Hello? Hello? Testing.
good evening. Nice to see you.
it's great to be here in your room.
where are you from?
you're in kindergarten, right? I love kindergarten.
best three years of my life.
of my life. But I love sports.
dodgeball was the best. I was the fastest one out there.
of course, I was the ball.
I was the ball, see...
all right.
thanks a lot. I'll be here all week.
remember to tip your waitresses.
great job, Mikey. You filled your quota on the first kid of the day.
not bad. Only somebody with perfect comedic timing could produce this much energy in one shot.
and the fact that laughter is ten times more powerful than scream had nothing to do with it?
googly bear, come here, you.
schmoopsie-pooh! - Googly.
girls, stop, stop, stop.
Michael, you're such a charmer.
did you bring the magazine? - They just delivered a whole box.
let me see it!
Sulley and I made the cover, right?
I don't believe it!
googly bear.
I'm on the cover of a magazine!
this is great.
Hey, Sulley. - Hey, Mike.
I was... - There's something I want to show you.
close your eyes. Follow me.
come on. No peeking.
keep coming, keep coming.
come on. - Mike!
follow the sultry sound of my voice.
OK, stop.
open 'em.
Mike, is that...
sorry it took so long, pal.
there was a lot of wood to go through.
it only works if you have every piece.
boo?
Kitty!

how YOU FEELING, MAN? PRETTY GOOD.
looks LIKE YOU GOT A LOT OF READIN' DONE.
Oh, NOT READING-- RESEARCH.
we're GOIN' HUNTIN'.
don't YOU HURT HER.
I THINK YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DREAM.
I'll SAY.
you WERE TALKING, MUTTERING SOMETHING.
what DID I SAY?
I'm SORRY.
?????
you ALMOST DIED LAST WEEK.
he SAVED YOU.
I UNDERSTAND.
I WAS DREAMING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS LITTLE, WHEN I WAS TAKEN.
I WAS IN THE ROOM WITH A SCARY WOMAN,
only THIS TIME MICK WAS THERE.
well, THAT'S YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS TRYING TO PROCESS EVERYTHING,
you KNOW?
think YOU SHOULD TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT IT?
I THINK... I SHOULD GO TO WORK.
do YOU KNOW WHERE I COULD FIND BETH TURNER?
great, THANKS.
all RIGHT, MAN.
Oh, LOOK WHO'S SLUMMIN' AGAIN.
Ah, THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE REMINDED
what A REAL REPORTER LOOKS LIKE.
please. BY THE TIME YOU PUT OUT YOUR LITTLE EARLY EDITION, WE'VE COVERED OVERNIGHT PLUS VIDEO FOLLOW-UPS, OKAY?
please. PEOPLE WANT NEWS, OK？
they WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT LATEST CELEBRITY TRAIN WRECK PASSED OUT IN THEIR OWN VOMIT,
they READ YOU. WOW.
2 MILLION VISITORS SO FAR TODAY AND COUNTING.
Oh, BOY.
here. FOR YOU. IT'S NOT EVEN IN THE STORES YET.
I FINALLY GET TO READ IT.
Yes, AND HERE IS AN INVITATION TO THE RELEASE PARTY.
steve AND I ARE ON IT. CAN'T WAIT.
we'll GET PLENTY OF B-ROLL,
make SURE WE CAPTURE THE WHOLE VIBE.
Oh, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU DOING THIS FOR ME.
Oh, FORGET IT????
lee JAY IS A GAT HUMAN INTEREST STORY.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU ???
he's SO NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT.
he BECAME A SCULPTOR WHEN HE WAS IN PRISON,
got INVOLVED WITH A PROGRAM TO BRING AT-RISK KIDS TO ART.
there's ONE THING I DIDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND YESTERDAY.
why WERE THE COPS SO CONVINCED THAT LEE JAY WAS GUILTY OF EILEEN'S MURDER?
he HAD SOME PRIORS.
he WAS AN EASY MARK, EVEN WITH THE CONTAMINATED EVIDENCE.
the POLICE CONTAMINATED ???
it WAS A P. I. ACTUALLY. HE ALMOST BEAT LEE JAY TO DEATH.
Mick ST. JOHN? ARE YOU SURE?
of COURSE I'M SURE. I WROTE THE BOOK.
here.
Oh, MY GOSH.
do YOU KNOW HIM?
he NEVER RETURNED MY CALLS.
Yeah, I MEAN, THE MICK ST. JOHN I KNOW IS, LIKE, 30.
this HAPPENED 25 YEARS AGO.
this CAN'T BE THE SAME GUY.
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD IT IS TO COME UP WITH A GIFT THAT SAYS, "THANKS FOR SAVING ME FROM A PSYCHO SERIAL KILLER"?
miss MANNERS DOESN'T COVER THAT?
surprisingly, NO. SO...
25-YEAR-OLD. THANK YOU.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE THIS.
a FRIEND OF MINE WROTE IT.
there WAS A P. I. INVOLVED IN THIS CASE
called MICK ST. JOHN.
Really?
so?
that PICTURE WAS FROM 1950, BACK BEFORE I BECAME A VAMPIRE,
when FILM COULD STILL CAPTURE MY IMAGE.
that's MY FATHER.
looks MORE LIKE YOUR TWIN.
I INHERITED SOME STRONG GENES.
the BOOK SAYS YOUR FATHER HAD A SERIOUS RUN-IN WITH LEE JAY.
did HE EVER TELL YOU ABOUT THAT?
kind OF.
he TOLD ME LEE JAY WAS ONE OF THOSE BROKEN INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN'T STOP THEMSELVES, THAT THEY HAVE TO KILL.
so YOU MIGHT WANT TO TELL YOUR FRIEND SHE'S GOT IT ALL WRONG.
she's A REALLY GOOD REPORTER.
she RESEARCHED THIS VERY CAREFULLY. TELL HER SHE GOT IT WRONG.
okay.
and TELL HER TO BE CAREFUL.
I GUESS I SHOULD GO.
Hey, LEE JAY.
Hey.
good TO BE FREE AGAIN, HUH?
Yeah, 25 YEARS LATE, BUT GOOD TO BE OUT.
now WE GOT THAT STUFF YOU WANTED.
good.
????
we ???????
Yeah, SOMETHIN' LIKE THAT.
it's GOOD TO SEE YOU, BOBBY.
I HAD A FEELING YOU'D DROP BY AFTER THEY PAROLED LEE JAY.
Yeah, I KNOW. I SHOULD HAVE KEPT IN TOUCH.
but YOU'RE HERE NOW, AND GET A LOAD OF THIS.
detective Desmond, Lee Jay Spalding.
you arrested me, helped put me behind bars.
I saw you at all my parole hearings, always telling the Board not to set me free.
well, I want you to know that I, uh, I forgive you.
it's all behind me now.
well, WHEN I WANT FORGIVENESS,
I WON'T BE APPLYING TO LEE JAY SPALDING. IT'S MY FAULT THAT HE'S OUT.
it's THE BOOK'S FAULT. HE'LL KILL AGAIN, BOBBY.
as SOON AS HE FINDS A WOMAN TO PLAY.
I THINK HE MAY HAVE ALREADY-- THE AUTHOR.
well, THAT'S GONNA BE SOME HONEYMOON.
you STILL GOT THAT CASE FILE?
the FIRST WIFE?
Oh, YEAH. THAT OTHER SO-CALLED SUICIDE?
I GOT IT OUT FOR YOU.
you KNOW, HE WOULDN'T BE GETTING OUT IF WE'D BEEN ABLE TO ADMIT THAT AS EVIDENCE.
I KNOW.
so WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING NOW?
I've GOT A FRIEND. SHE'S A REPORTER.
she DOESN'T KNOW THE REAL STORY OF LEE JAY,
only WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BOOK.
don't YOU GO DOING NOTHING STUPID.
we're SENIOR CITIZENS NOW. DON'T WANT TO BREAK A HIP.
you BE CAREFUL, TOO, OKAY?
and YOU MAKE SURE YOU CALL ME IF LEE JAY CONTACTS YOU AGAIN.
God, MICK, IT'S GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.
same AS EVER.
Hey, WHAT'S WITH THESE MUSCLES? HOW YOU STAYING SO FIT?
Oh, YOU KNOW, DIET.
give ME SOME OF THAT.
take CARE.
you TAKE CARE, BOBBY.
you TAKE CARE.
when YOU LIVE FOREVER, IT'S DISAPPOINTING HOW LITTLE HUMANS CHANGE.
technology, THOUGH-- IT ALWAYS GETS BETTER.
if I HADN'T BECOME A VAMPIRE, I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON THE INTERNET, "WORLD OF WARCRAFT..."
and G. P.S.
get SOME STUFF OF LEE JAY AND JULIA.
don't GET IN THEIR FACES...
but GET THEIR FACES. ROGER THAT.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU...
apologize.
that's FINE. YOU'RE ENTITLED TO YOUR OPINION.
it's A FREE COUNTRY, RIGHT?
right. I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.
it's THE CASE FILE FROM LEE JAY'S ARREST.
you NEED TO READ THAT.
you REALLY THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE?
open IT, PLEASE. YOU NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
I'm KIND OF BUSY RIGHT NOW.
Beth, THERE YOU ARE. I WANT YOU TO MEET LEE JAY.
Oh, MY GOD.
uh, THIS IS MICK ST. JOHN.
you KNEW... MY FATHER.
Yes. I TRIED TO CONTACT HIM TO INTERVIEW HIM FOR MY BOOK.
he PASSED AWAY. I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
Thanks.
it's TIME. YOU'RE ON.
catch YOU LATER, MICK.
Yeah, YOU WILL.
ladies AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELLCOME LEE JAY SPALDING.
ladies AND GENTLEMEN, the man of the hour I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW GREAT IT IS TO BE OUT,
and I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING ALL OF YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME.
I SEE ALL THESE WONDERFUL YOUNG FACES HERE TONIGHT,
and I'VE WORKED WITH SOME OF YOU,
and OTHERS I'M MEETING TONIGHT, I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU, BECAUSE ONCE, I WAS YOU.
don't EVER LET ANYBODY HOLD YOU BACK.
I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE OR HOW TOUGH THEY THINK THEY ARE.
you LOOK THEM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE, AND YOU SAY, "I'M BETTER THAN YOU.
I'm STRONGER THAN YOU,
and I'M GOING TO WIN.
thank YOU.
the SCARY ONE.
you MIGHT HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE FOOLED,
but I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.
Oh, WHAT AM I?
you're NOT GONNA GET AWAY WITH IT THIS TIME.
Oh, I KNOW, I KNOW. THEY SAY THEY'VE GOTTEN TOUGH ON CRIME.
they ALWAYS SAY THAT.
no.
I MEANT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HURTING ANY MORE WOMEN.
I WON'T LET YOU.
you KNOW, IT'S FUNNY,
because I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE...
vampire.
you've PROBABLY KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN I HAVE, HAVEN'T YOU?
now IF I GOT THIS RIGHT,
a STAKE IN YOUR HEART WILL PARALYZE YOU.
I COULD PUT YOU IN AN ART DISPLAY
for THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE,
maybe PUT YOU IN ONE OF MY NEW SCULPTURES.
Oh, MICK.
Aah! BACK OFF!
you STAY AWAY FROM ME! YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME!
lee JAY, WHAT HAPPENED? OH, THAT MAN'S CRAZY.
you ALL RIGHT? THAT MAN'S CRAZY.
somebody HELP! PLEASE, SOMEBODY HELP.
lee JAY. LEE JAY, WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENED?
Oh, MY GOD. WE HAVE TO GET YOU TO A HOSPITAL.
please, I DON'T WANT ANY MORE TROUBLE.
um, OKAY, YOUR FRIEND?
not SO GOOD AT PARTIES.
lee Jay, we should call the police.
no, DON'T CALL THE POLICE.
I DON'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES.
all RIGHT, HE'S OBVIOUSLY DISTURBED,
but JAIL IS NOT WHAT HE NEEDS.
very NICE. IS THAT YOUR PARTY PERSONALITY?
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I'd HATE TO SEE WHAT YOU CALL "SOMETHING.
I DIDN'T TOUCH HIM.
Yeah, RIGHT. HE DID THAT TO HIMSELF.
that's RIDICULOUS.
the PAIN AND BLOOD IS WORTH SETTING ME UP.
it's JUST THE WAY HE THINKS. DID YOU READ THE CASE FILE?
you KNOW??????
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE YET.
this GUY KILLED TWO WOMEN, BETH, AND HE PAWNED THEM BOTH OFF AS SUICIDES.
that GUY ROMANCING YOUR FRIEND...
he's A KILLER.
trust ME.
Eileen HANNIGAN CAME TO ME IN 1983, AN ABUSED SPOUSE.
I'd HEARD THE STORY A HUNDRED TIMES.
I WENT TO THE POLICE. I GOT A RESTRAINING ORDER.
let ME GUESS. HE IGNORED IT.
he BURNED IT IN FRONT OF ME.
he DO THIS?
he SAID THAT IF I EVER TRIED TO LEAVE HIM, HE WOULD KILL ME.
so I BOUGHT THIS.
are YOU READY TO USE THAT,
you DON'T WANT THE GUN.
you DON'T WANT TO GIVE HIM THE CHANCE TO USE IT ON YOU.
I'm GONNA TAKE CARE OF THIS.
now, LEE JAY...
I'm GONNA SAY THIS ONCE.
you EVER HURT EILEEN AGAIN, YOU TOUCH A HAIR ON HER HEAD, I'M GONNA COME BACK, AND I'M NOT GONNA BE SO GENTLE.
you TELL ME YOU UNDERSTAND ME.
I UNDERSTAND.
are YOU SURE?
I UNDERSTAND!
good.
I THOUGHT I'D TAN CARE OF HIM, BUT I WAS YOUNG AND STUPID BACK THEN.
I THOUGHT VIOLENCE SOLVED EVERYTHING.
hmm? RED OR WHITE?
I WILL TAKE... THE RED.
I TOLD YOU, NOT WHILE I'M EATING.
it's YOUR ANSWERING SERVICE. SAYS IT'S IMPORTANT.
Mick? It's Bobby Desmond. You'd better get down here.
looks LIKE SUICIDE
gun IN HAND, SHOT THROUGH MOUTH.
please, GET HELP!
lee JAY! LEE JAY, WHAT HAPPENED?
Hey, YOU GOT A STORY IN THE PIPELINE?
Yeah, WHY MICK IS SO RILED UP ABOUT A 25-YEAR-OLD CASE.
Yeah, THAT'S NOT A STORY.
that's OBVIOUS.
it WAS HIS FATHER, RIGHT?
that's THE WEIRD THING.
his FATHER WASN'T A COP OR A P. I.
in FACT, THERE'S NO RECORD OF HIM AT ALL.
maybe YOU HAVE THE WRONG NAME.
no, I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING MICK ISN'T TELLING ME.
lee JAY'S ARRESTING OFFICER-- BOBBY DESMOND.
maybe HE CAN TELL ME WHY MICK'S OBSESSED WITH THIS CASE.
retired. STILL LIVES IN L. A.
what DO YOU THINK?
go FOR IT.
so YOU NEVER THOUGHT EILEEN'S SHOOTING WAS A SUICIDE EITHER?
why HIRE SOMEBODY TO PROTECT YOU IF YOU PLANNED ON KILLING YOURSELF ANYWAY?
I HEARD LEE JAY GOT BEAT UP PRETTY BADLY.
Yeah, MICK DID A NUMBER ON HIM, THAT'S FOR SURE.
but LEE JAY HAD IT COMING TO HIM,
and EVERYBODY KNEW THAT.
like FATHER, LIKE SON. HUH?
his SON HAS A TEMPER.
who DOES?
his SON MICK... JR. I GUESS.
he's OBSESSED WITH LEE JAY, JUST LIKE HIS DAD.
no, NO, NO. MICK NEVER HAD A SON--NEVER MARRIED.
uh, MICK HAS A SON. I KNOW HIM.
darlin', I'VE KNOWN MICK ST. JOHN FOR OVER 35 YEARS,
and I'M TELLING YOU, THERE IS NO SON.
the MAN IS ONE OF A KIND. ASK HIM YOURSELF.
he's ALIVE?
and KICKIN'.
he WAS IN HERE JUST THE OTHER DAY ALL RILED UP ABOUT LEE JAY'S GETTING OUT.
this IS SAD.
you HAVE, UH, W-WHAT'S THE WORD, UH, FOOD ISSUES?
how'd YOU GET IN HERE?
25 YEARS ON THE INSIDE, YOU GET SOME SKILLS.
put THAT DOWN. OR WHAT, YOU TEAR MY HEAD OFF?
Yeah. BUT THE THING IS, I TOLD EVERYBODY I KNOW I WAS COMIN' OVER HERE TO MAKE PEACE.
now HOW WOULD THAT LOOK, HUH?
Oh, GOD. THAT'S DISGUSTING. HOW DO YOU LIVE LIKE THIS?
so WHAT'S THE DEAL, MICK?
YOU'RE--WHAT, YOU'RE STRONGER THAN US? SMARTER?
I GOTTA ADMIT THAT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO SEEMS TO SEE THROUGH MY B. S.
or MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU, UH, GET ME.
we're NOT SO DIFFERENT, REALLY.
we're NOTHING ALIKE.
no? WELL, WHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE WHEN YOU KILL SOMEBODY?
because I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN I DO.
Hey, EASY, MICK.
this IS YOUR GUN, MICK
the ONE YOU KEEP HIDDEN BEHIND THE DESK.
that's GOTTA BE PRETTY ANNOYING FOR YOU USING THIS
when YOU COULD TEAR SOMEBODY APART WITH YOUR TEETH.
another FAKE SUICIDE, HUH?
is THAT THE PLAN?
you're SO SMART. YOU TELL ME.
well, YOU BETTER HAVE THE RIGHT AMMUNITION.
Oh, I DO.
Aah! DAMN!
9-1-1. What is the nature of your emergency?
I ????
a BIG ????
you KNOW WHAT? I SEE IT NOW.
it's LIKE YOUR OWN LITTLE PRISON, ISN'T IT?
this WHOLE VAMPIRE THING. SHUT UP.
you CAN'T HAVE ANYBODY POKIN' AROUND
a GIRLFRIEND, ANYONE WHO CARES
you GOT A PROBLEM.
God, YOU'RE A BUNDLE OF NERVES.
Oh, YEAH, THE GUN.
leave IT, THAT LOOKS BAD.
you TAKE IT, THAT LOOKS EVEN WORSE.
you MADE THE NEWS.
great.
well, APPARENTLY, ATTEMPTED MURDER,
the CHARGE AGAINST YOU, CARRIES A 25-YEAR PENALTY.
the FIREARM ENHANCEMENT ADDS ANOTHER 15.
that's WHAT THEY CALLED IT-- AN "ENHANCEMENT.
he's GETTING EXACTLY ????
me IN PRISON AS PAYBACK AND FREE REIN WITH NO ONE TO STOP HIM. AND YOU GET NOTHING.
a PRISON IS NOT THE VAMPIRE'S FRIEND.
no. NO.
but LOOK ON THE POSITIVE SIDE. YOU KNOW, IN 25 YEARS, YOU COULD PROBABLY GET A BOOK DEAL.
Oh, THANK YOU.
you're WAY OFF YOUR GAME, PAL.
what DID YOU SAY?
you HEARD ME.
he HAD 25 YEARS TO PLAN HIS NEXT MOVE.
you WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN IT COMING, EITHER. THAT'S NOT EVEN WHAT I MEANT.
why DIDN'T YOU KILL HIM, MICK?
why DIDN'T YOU TAKE THIS GUY OUT?
why DIDN'T YOU END HIM? WITH LEE JAY ALIVE,
there's A CHANCE THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT.
you THINK SO? YEAH.
it's NOT THAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT SOME BLONDE REPORTER MIGHT THINK OF YOU IF YOU'D GIVEN THAT GUY WHAT HE DESERVED?
this IS A CHANCE FOR ME TO ERASE A REGRET.
you KNOW, I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW.
you're GONNA HAVE TO SPLIT. YOU KNOW THAT?
you KNOW, A NEW TOWN, NEW IDENTITY.
I KNOW A GUY WHO DOES RELOCATIONS, YOU KNOW?
he WORKS WITH A LOT OF VAMPS.
I LEAVE, MORE PEOPLE DIE.
no, MAN.
I'm NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
I just got word they're releasing Lee Jay from the hospital in a couple of hours.
you've gotta get over there.
fine. ON MY WAY.
Yeah, I wish I had a break like this when I was starting out.
what DO YOU MEAN?
well, shooter on the lam, personal friend of yours
that's "lucky" gift wrapped, girl. Go for it.
okay, BYE.
do YOU THINK HE REALLY TRIED TO KILL LEE JAY?
what, YOU DON'T?
no, NOT REALLY.
you're KIDDING, RIGHT?
he ATTACKS THE GUY IN A PUBLIC PLACE.
the GUY ENDS UP SHOT IN HIS APARTMENT, AND THEN HE FLEES.
is THERE SOME PART OF THAT THAT'S NOT COMPLETELY INCRIMINATING?
you DON'T KNOW HIM.
you BARELY DO, EITHER.
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THAT MICK'S NOT TELLING ME.
you KNOW, SINCE YOU MET THAT GUY...
screwed UP" HAS STARTED TO SEEM NORMAL.
Hey.
you're MICK ST. JOHN.
is BETH HERE?
no.
they're LOOKING FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T SHOOT LEE JAY.
then WHY DID YOU RUN?
why DIDN'T YOU STAY THERE AND TELL THE POLICE WHAT HAPPENED?
because I'M A VAMPIRE.
because I'M A VAMPIRE...
because I'M A VAMPIRE?
there IS NO GOOD WAY TO SAY IT.
I GUESS I PANICKED.
look, HE CAN'T BE HERE. YOU KNOW THAT.
I'm AN ATTORNEY... I KNOW.
in THE D. A.'s OFFICE. I KNOW.
I'm HARBORING A FUGITIVE HERE.
listen, I UNDERSTAND THIS LOOKS BAD
I'll GET DISBARRED AND JAILED.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, OKAY?
this GUY COMES TO MY PLACE
and WHAT, SHOT HIMSELF? YES.
that's WHAT LEE JAY DOES.
he's STAGED MURDERS BEFORE. IT'S ALL IN THE POLICE FILE.
see FOR YOURSELF, JOSH.
I NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH.
I AM. YOU KNOW I AM. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT...
what DO YOU NEED ME TO DO?
I KNOW I SAID MY IMAGE COULDN'T BE CAPTURED, BUT THAT WAS BACK IN THE DAYS OF SILVER EMULSION AND FILM.
digital HAS CHANGED ALL THAT.
okay, IT'S GONNA BE BEST IF YOU LOOK STRAIGHT INTO CAMERA.
okay, READY? ON MY COUNT.
the TRUTH IS, I'M INNOCENT.
I DID NOT SHOOT LEE JAY SPALDING.
Spalding STAGED THE SCENE AND SHOT HIMSELF.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S DOING THIS.
now I KNOW???
but THIS IS A VERY SICK INDIVIDUAL WHO'S DONE THIS TWICE BEFORE.
the FIRST TIME WAS IN 1982, WHEN HE FAKED THE SUICIDE DEATH OF HIS FIRST WIFE MARIE McCULLOUGH, WHO HAD THE NERVE TO TRY TO LEAVE HIM.
the SECOND TIME WAS WHEN HE SHOT HIS ESTRANGED GIRLFRIEND HEI ????
all I'M ASKING FOR... HEY, BEAUTIFUL.
you OKAY? YEAH.
let's GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
are YOU FEELING BETTER, LEE JAY?
Yeah. LUCKILY, HE MISSED THE MAJOR ARTERIES.
why DOES MICK ST. JOHN HAVE SUCH A VENDETTA AGAINST YOU?
don't ASK ME TO UNDERSTAND THE WORKINGS OF A CRIMINAL MIND.
what ABOUT THE REPORT ON "BuzzWire
that YOU'VE MURDERED TWO WOMEN
and STAGED THE SHOOTING THAT HOSPITALIZED YOU?
that REPORT WOULD BE INCORRECT.
okay Let's go.
all RIGHT, NO MORE QUESTIONS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY MEDIA OUTLETS HAVE PICKED THIS STORY UP.
BuzzWire's" GOT THE BIGGEST SYNDICATED FEED ON THE NET.
so WHAT'S NEXT, THOUGH?
I THINK IT'S HIS MOVE NEXT.
it's JULIA.
okay, I KNOW YOU MUST BE FURIOUS WITH ME, AND I KNOW YOU LOVE HIM AND ALL THAT,
but IT'S TRUE, JULIA, AND YOU REALLY HAD TO KNOW.
I KNOW, BETH.
I KNOW.
put HIM ON.
put HIM ON!
put him on WHAT DO YOU WANT?
you WATCH YOUR TONE WITH ME.
what DO YOU WANT?
you DO NOT TALK TO ME THAT WAY!
you FORGET WHO YOU'RE TALKIN' TO.
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE, MICK.
now HERE'S WHAT I WANT.
I want you to go down to the nearest police station, AND I WANT YOU TO TURN YOURSELF IN.
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I'M NOT GONNA SAY I DID.
you KNOW WHAT? IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT,
then JULIA ENDS UP LIKE EILEEN.
how DO I KNOW YOU WON'T KILL HER ANYWAY?
you DON'T. YOU GOT ONE HOUR.
please.
help me.
please!
you HEAR THAT?
hard TO SAY NO, ISN'T IT?
look, IF YOU DON'T TURN YOURSELF IN, HE'S GONNA KILL HER.
he's GONNA KILL HER ANYWAY.
I THINK WE SHOULD GO TO THE POLICE. THEY CAN TRACE THE CALL.
we ONLY HAVE ONE HOUR. WE NEED MORE TIME THAN THAT.
you do not talk to me that way!
you forget who you're talkin' to.
I know what you are, Mick.
I GOT A FRIEND IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS.
maybe I CAN GET HIM TO ISSUE SOME KIND OF STATEMENT THAT
that MICK'S TURNED HIMSELF IN, THAT HE'S IN CUSTODY.
okay. OKAY. AND WHAT WILL YOU DO?
all I NEED IS SOME TIME.
here, TAKE THIS. IT'LL HELP.
hurry.
all RIGHT.
Hey, JOSH...
thank YOU.
you TRIED TO WARN ME JULIA WAS IN DANGER.
Yeah, WELL, NONE OF US WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S MONSTERS
you DID.
I THINK I HAVE A WAY OF FINDING THEM.
I TAGGED JULIA'S CAR.
you WANT TO NAVIGATE?
what DID HE MEAN, "I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE"?
Oh, RIGHT HERE.
Mick, WHAT DID HE MEAN?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
how ABOUT WE GET JULIA FIRST?
how ABOUT YOU FINALLY ANSWER A QUESTION ?
hour's ALMOST UP.
like THAT.
we ALL HAVE SECRETS, BETH...
and THAT'S NOT EVADING.
right HERE.
okay, STOP, STOP, STOP.
all RIGHT, I'M GOIN' IN.
open THE GLOVE BOX.
now DO YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THAT?
you REMEMBER WHAT I SAID?
call THE COPS IF YOU'RE NOT OUT IN TEN MINUTES.
don't COME INSIDE. I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
okay.
why DOES THE GIRL ALWAYS HAVE TO WAIT IN THE CAR?
... CONFIRMED REPORTS THAT FUGITIVE MICK ST. JOHN, WANTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SHOOTING OF LEE JAY SPALDING, HAS TURNED HIMSELF IN TO AUTHORITIES AT THE WILSHIRE DIVISION.
well, OUR WORK HERE'S DONE.
run.
don't BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SEE ON TV.
silver BUCKSHOT.
had TO SPECIAL ORDER IT.
now CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,
but, UH, SILVER'S LIKE POISON TO YOU.
the ONLY THING MORE DEADLY TO A VAMPIRE...
fire.
now I GOTTA ADMIT THAT PART OF ME WONDERS
what IT WOULD BE LIKE...
to LIVE FOREVER...
powerful.
the LAST THING THIS WORLD NEEDS IS AN ETERNAL YOU.
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STAY IN THE CAR.
don't EVER LET ANYBODY HOLD YOU BACK.
I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE OR HOW TOUGH THEY THINK THEY ARE.
you LOOK THEM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE,
and YOU SAY, "I'M BETTER THAN YOU, "I'M STRONGER THAN YOU, AND I'M GOING TO WIN.
he-- HE KIDNAPPED ME.
he WAS GONNA KILL ME.
it's OKAY. IT'S OKAY. SLOW DOWN.
MICK-- MICK SAVED ME.
Mick SAVED ME.
I WAS SO WRONG.
okay, SO MICK SHOT LEE JAY? NO.
no, I DID.
Hey, HEY, HEY! BETH!
where YOU GOIN'?
Beth, GET BACK HERE.
yoran OFF AGAIN.
one SECOND YOU WERE THERE, AND THEN YOU WERE... GONE.
are... ARE YOU OKAY?
please LEAVE.
not WITHOUT ANSWERS.
I KEEP DREAMING ABOUT YOU.
Why?
please DON'T LOOK AT ME.
Oh, MY GOD.
what ???
I'm A VAMPIRE.
I wanna help people. it's why i became a p. i. I heard what you said.
that i'm a vampire.
so do you bite people's necks and suck the blood out?
actually, i-i get most of my blood from the blood bank.
what about daylight? daylight's not good,
but the longer i'm in the sun, the worse i feel.
it's gonna get dangerous, beth.
then it's a good thing i got you around.
my wife turned me on our wedding night.
you're the first human that i've told any of this to.
so, yeah, i trust you.
what do you do
when the one thing you need to save your life...
is the one thing that would make life unbearable?
you're probably wondering how someone like me ends up
hard to believe it started just yesterday.
21 hours earlier blood is life for vamps and humans alike.
it warms us and thrills us,
helps us heal,
but vamps will always be jealous of the living,
like renters versus owners.
you can make your own blood.
we've got to beg, borrow or work it into the budget.
day 16 of the murder trial of arms dealer amir fayed
brought few surprises and no real progress
for prosecutor joshua lindsey.
Fayed is accused of murdering jack toland,
an associate who walater revealed
to be a police informant.
since the federal racketeering case fell apart last fall,
deputy d. a. lindsey says that this murder trial
may be the last chance to bring this monster to justice,
but the defense has painted a solid picture of fayed
as a diplomat, philanthropist
and most importantly, an innocent man.
with reasonable doubt running high,
ndsey will have his hands full this monday
as the trial nears its end.
this is beth turner for "bUZZwIRE."
your confidence in me is overwhelming.
I think i was overcompensating with the dry and ftual.
I was afraid i'd start babbling about how hot you are.
so what do you have cooked up for monday?
what are you talking about?
please. all the late night calls, the cat-that-ate-the-canary smile?
maybe i'm cheating on you.
who would cheat... on this?
come on. i know how you work.
you wouldn't be this cool unless you had an ace in the hole.
a secret witness?
yeah right ????
this place might be safe, but it's never quiet.
what's up with all the helicopters?
crime never sleeps.
so we can't either?
there's a good deejay spinning down the street.
who wants to go clubbing? yeah, let me just put my bling on.
fine. i'll just read my trashy tabloid, if someone remembered.
ye of little faith.
thank you, officer colden.
good night.
Hey. it's leni.
can you talk?
everyone's got an opinion. you know, gas, propane.
who cares?
I hate barbecuing.
but anna's parents-- they like that mesquite crap.
man, you gotta go with the gas line.
who is it?
Oh, yeah. hey. y name's eli.
I live down the hall.
I'm sorry bug you guys, but i shelled out for the pay-per-view
Gonzales and whittaker
and now my cable's gone all wonky.
can you check yours?
sorry.
take cover!
go! go! go!
go! go! go!
some couples just aren't meant to be together.
take me and beth.
she has a very real boyfriend, and, well, after coraline...
I have understandable trust issues.
still, when i see it's beth calling...
I always pick up.
Hello? Mick, hey. It's Beth.
hadn't heard from her in a week,
ever since i trusted her with the charming story
of how my wife turned me into a vampire
on our wedding night.
now beth wanted to come over.
Oh, thanks.
I'm sorry about crashing your sunday morning, but i wouldn't do it if it wasn't an emergency.
well, you're here now, so...
I know we didn't exactly get off on the right foot, but i've heard good things from beth.
I'm glad the buzz is good. what's your point?
I wanna hire you to find someone.
a witness has gone missing. don't the cops work for you?
they do, and they're running their own investigation, but there's a leak somewhere, i actually had to drag beth here.
she didn't want me to bother you.
okay, tell me about your witness.
this mean you'll do it?
hey,you came to me.
her name's leni hayes.
she was the nanny for amir fayed's daughter.
the arms dealer?
Yeah, and she's only 22, but smart.
leni was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
she saw fayed murder one of his guys, jack toland, and she's been in a safe house in hollywood for the last moh.
last nightthey were hit.
I need you to find leni and bring her back to testify.
okay.
two cops protecting her were d. o.a.
they were good guys. an hour later, and i would've taken over graveyard shift for nagawa.
I probably wouldn't use that term today if i was you.
I thought i toldou to take the day off today.
I wanna help catch the bastards who did this and help geteni back.
then go back to my office and give kevin your statement. who's he?
we think there must have been a couple of shooters.
smoke makes a good silent partner.
we don't think any of this is leni's blood. it's not. there's no estrogen.
Beth said you had an interesting way of working.
yeah?
she alsoaid it's never boring around you.
if an attack came from the front, leni was instructed to go out through the kitchen service entrance and then down the back stairs. but she didn't.
what makes you think that?
well, there were bullets flying that way.
you think she went out the window?
she cut herself on the latch on the way out.
sir?
y--just one second.
she went this way.
this guy's good.
somehow i thought you were exaggerating.
what did you find inside?
Beth, remember our deal.
come on. i waited outside leni's trail ends at a spot just past that dumpster.
the freshest tire treads are something big--a truck, s.u. v.
colden drives a truck. well, can you put an a. p.b. out on it?
better yet, he had it lOjACKED.
I'll get a warrant for the records. we're running out of time here.
best i can do. look, i tta get back to my office.
keep me informed. yeah.
warrant's gonna take too long. tell me somethin' i don't know.
Steve, it's beth. i need you to tap into the lOjACK system.
find me the current location of a truck registered to richard colden.
okay, she steals the cop's truck to get away.
why would leni come here?
there's no record of friends or family to hide out with.
Dalton avenue sounds so familiar.
I think i've covered a story here once.
so what's your deal with josh?
Oh, we've been together for a while.
he's smart, funny, um...
no, no, no. i meant your deal from the alley.
Oh, right.
he's really worried about this leak, thinks his calls are being tapped.
I'm a clean line of communication with you.
so what's in it for you? the story of leni's safe recovery.
sounds like a conflict of interest to me.
post-verdict. it's all legal.
Hey. i've been covering my boyfriend's cases long before i met you.
so how long can you stay outside?
like, how much sun is too much?
any is too much.
don't you have a job or something?
Yes. today it's folwing you.
after last time, what with the incinerator and the stakes in the heart, i wasn't sure if i was gonna see you again.
it was a lot to process, but i'm--i'm glad you told me about your wife turning you and...
Yeah. i think this is it.
whose house is this?
I don't know.
I think leni knew where the spare key was. hold that.
why would leni come here?
to clean herself up.
okay.
so the mystery owner has a gun, bandages, subpar housecleaning skills.
Mick, this is jack toland's house.
the guy fayed's accused of killing?
I didn't know leni knew him.
nobody did, not even josh. she was his witness.
why would she hide something like this?
looks like they were in love.
if that was true, maybe she kept it a secret so her testimony wouldn't seem biased.
let me see that.
164 las cruces lane.
it's in victorville.
fingers crossed.
rapid tREK bUS lINES.
Yeah, can i have the times for all the l. a.victorville buses today, please.
Yeah.
thank you.
well, this is where we go our separate ways.
Oh. why can't i go with you?
because this girl is scared, and she has a gun.
besides, you're my contact to josh, remember?
I know, it's just thateing on the hunt with you is kinda fun.
Yeah, it's a giant thrill ride that never ends.
with terrible screams and bloodshed.
still...
we make a good team.
come on. come on.
try this one.
swap you.
Thanks.
you got a problem?
no, but you do, leni.
who are you?
I'm mick st. john. i'm a private detective.
Josh lindsey hired me to get you back to l. a. safely.
well, i'm not going back. don't come any closer.
I'm here to protect you. yeah, that's what the cops said.
listen, you gotta trust me.
when i get shot, it still hurts like hell,
but i know it won't last for long.
I'm okay. you missed-- i never even fired a gun before.
my boyfriend always said i should learn. i don't
you boyfriend oh, just in case. jack toland?
I've been to his house. i know you two were involved.
so i'm supposed to trust you?
if i wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.
I just want to talk.
you hungry?
Yeah.
okay, come on. come on in.
Mick seems pretty confident he can get the jump on her.
seems like he could get the jump on just about anyone.
Josh, i just got this pic-- beth, hey.
when are you gonna dump this stiff and run away with me?
Oh, i think one d. a.'S enough for me.
Ah, but you'lllways wonder if it was the right one.
did you get anything from the call log? 10: 30 last night, officer richard colden called a cell phone paid for by none other than amir fayed.
are you serious? colden called a hit on his own safe house?
Yeah, frickin' dirty cop on the take.
I doubt if he expected to be part of the body count.
looks like our leak was plugged. if colden was our leak.
you think there was more on the force?
I don't know, but either way, i wanna follow up on the cell phone call. yeah.
Hi. this is deputy d. a. lindsey for judge howard.
I need a warrant. yes, i know he's on the course. i'll get backup.
I'll meet you out front in five. well, make sure he gets back to me. i need this today.
when i get thirsty, i start to see blood everywhere.
even the damn tomato juice made me think that maybe
I'd found a vamp-friendly vending machine.
Oh, thanks.
so why were you working for fayed anyway?
I was his daughter's nanny.
it's not mara's fault her dad's a sociopath.
what happened?
I went downstairs to get mara a glass of water, and i heard shouting.
it was the night mr. fayed found out that jack was talking to the cops.
he just lost it.
shot him. i couldn't even scream.
I mean, it was like i was frozen.
Oh, i see what you're doing.
trying to be all friendly, all "you can talk to me.
I already told you, i'm not testifying.
you cared so much about this guy.
don't you want to see some justice for him?
this guy"? his name is jack.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
he's not just some thug.
he was a good guy trying to go straight.
the human heartbeat is always there in the background,
but i finally understood
e strange echo i'd been hearing--
a smaller, faster heartbeat.
you're protecting the baby.
how did you know i'm pregnant?
it makes sense. you ran instead of calling josh because you knew that it wasn't just your life the guard at the gate should have told you.
Mr. fayed isn't home.
well, if he isn't, he's violating the terms of his parole.
got a warrant.
Hi.
Hello?
Beth. iT'S mICK. i'M WITH lENI.
Oh, thank god. she was in victorville.
Yeah. she's scared, but i think she's gonna let me bring her back. why wouldn't she want to come back?
she's pregnant.
Oh. you gotta handle her carefully, mick. reassure her.
Yeah, well, it's not really my forte, but i'll try.
okay. i'LL GET jOSH. jOSH.
it's mick. did he get her?
yes mick. all right, sit tight.
I WANT TO HAVE LOCAL COPS ESCORT YOU GUYS IN.
what do you think? yeah, yeah, i worked a case with them last year.
they're good men.
okay, victorville p. d. will be there within an hour.
an hour? you know what? i don't need an escort, okay?
I'm better on my own. tHAT WASN'T A REQUEST.
you okay?
Yeah, uh, i'm almost three months in.
I heard it gets better.
it's all gonna get better.
you got kids?
no.
no, i don't.
well, if it's a boy, maybe i'll call him mick.
you should call him jack.
Jack's a good name.
I want justice for jack, but...
look at me.
you come with me.
I'm gonna protect you both.
I promise.
okay?
okay.
let's go.
all right. there.
two in the back.
my lawyer's on his way.
M. b.a. from stanford.
figured you could read a simple warrant.
it's not bad enough you torment me in court.
now you invade my home on a sunday?
home? it's more like visiting day in san quentin.
cell phone records. what is this?
we're investigating a suspicious call made to your cell phone.
cell phone i pay for. there are dozens
my family, my staff, my associates.
well, how about we get your associates' cell phones out here on the table right now? and what will that prove?
maybe nothing. maybe a lot.
ringers on, fell.
Hey.
you're mara, right?
I'm beth, a friend of leni's.
I miss leni. she used to take me to the beach.
well, she's safe.
I know.
how do you know she's safe?
I'm not supposed to say.
if my dad found out... he's really mad at her.
Oh, that's okay. i won't tell your dad. i promise.
did leni call you last night?
it was my birthday.
can i see your cell phone?
Yeah.
thank you.
Josh, it's me.
don't SAY ANYTHING.
just COME OUTSIDE.
officer cOLDEN DIDN'T CALL THIS NUMBER.
leni did.
car 17, PLEASE REPORT YOUR e. t.a.
Mr. st. john?
I'm officer ark. victorville, p.d.
supposed to give you an escort back to l. a.
I told the d. a. i didn't need an escort.
I just know what i was told.
must be hot in that jacket today.
I never get hot. cold as ice, huh?
something like that. your girl ready to go?
Yeah, she's resting up in the ladies' room.
I'll, uh, i'll get her.
you know what? she's a little overwhelmed at the moment.
why don't you wait here?
sure.
you're telling me leni used colden's phone to call mara?
Yeah, a phone her dad pays for.
so that call had nothing to do with the safe house hit. which means there's still a le.
call mick. tell him to get leni out of there.
excuse me?
what's going on? why did we steal a cop car?
to put miles between us. damn it.
still no signal.
between who? us and the guy sent to kill you.
what? how did he find us?
doesn't matter. now it's about losing him.
what?
you had to piss off an arms dealer, didn't you?
look out!
get out. what?
do it. get out, get out.
shut the door.
great.
are you okay?
yeah are you okay yeah, i will be, as soon as we get out of here.
????
you think we could trust them?
I'm probably gonna regret this, but we're not gonna stick around to find out.
come on.
Thanks.
well?
that was victorville p. d. on the way to the bus station, they found a fresh accident scene.
apparently, mick and leni stole a police cruiser.
looks like they're dead.
there must be some mistake.
the car was in flames. it's too hot to even get close.
I'm sorry.
are you okay?
Mick didn't talk to anyone but you and i.
are you suggesting that i'm the leak?
I'm saying someone on your team is responsible, and you should find out who.
when i was still human,
I survived the battle of the bulge.
six weeks in a trench in the ardennes. here. give me this.
the coldest winter i ever felt.
my buddy lost a foot to frostbite.
I was wrong.
you look dehydrated.
do you wanna stop for a while?
we can't.
vampire survival instincts are simple.
if you're dying, you need blood.
doesn't matter that i'd sworn to protect leni and her baby.
if i can't get blood any other way,
I'll have to feed on her.
I won't be able to stop myself.
Mick, look.
um, maybe you should lie down?
find the ice machine. get a lot.
please. go. go.
go.
ice.
I raided the honor bar.
for you.
no.
we have to get you to a hospital.
this is not justegular dehydration.
something is seriously wrong.
no hospitals.
just keep trying to get a signal.
call the number i gave you. ask for beth.
just talk to her.
only beth.
who is she?
I trust her.
Hey, is she your girlfriend?
no.
it's complicated.
please, you must leave.
no, i want to stay here with you.
call beth. go.
go.
Hi. iT'S lENI hAYES.
are you okay?
Yeah.
is mick all right? can you put him on the line?
um, mick's not doing too good.
we HAD TO WALK A COUPLE MILES TO GET TO THIS OLD MOTEL AND...
it was hot.
very hot but he's alive?
Yes.
he's alive.
t-tell me where you are.
Mick, i spoke to beth.
she's coming.
Mick? did you hear m beth's coming.
get out!
get out, leni! get out now!
what do you get when you put a vampire in the desert?
maybe no more vampire.
you wanted to see us?
Yeah. come in. we just heard from lieutenant wetherly that the cruiser was nuked, but there are no signs of bodies inside.
I know. beth just called them. our witness is safe.
that's great.
victorville p. d. will babysit tonight, bring her in first thing tomorrow.
St. john's giving 'em a debrief on what happened.
what the hell did happen?
Leni, i'm beth.
you have to help him. where is he?
in here.
I think he's dying.
stay here.
stay with me.
stay with me.
you're burning up.
I bit her.
I'll die before i feed on her.
Mick, leni's in the other room. she's fine.
I guess...
I guess you are.
take leni back. get her out of here. he's coming.
I'm not leaving. you have to protect her now.
you're dying.
I don't know how to do this, but i know you need it.
so...
no. get out. get out!
you need blood. no, not yours.
look. not like this.
I want to do this.
what do you do
when the one thing you need to save your life
is the one thing
that would make life unbearable?
I know you won't kill me, and i know you won't try to turn me, either.
I've got this vampire friend who's been explaining this stuff.
you're gonna have to stop me.
victorville p. d. till 0600 tomorrow.
you want the address?
Josh, man, i-i can explain.
Really? 'cause it looks like you just dialed one of the numbers fayed pays for.
I got in a little bit over my head.
you know, march madness is... this guy came to me.
he told me he could give me a clear slate.
we're friends, man.
that just makes it worse.
scream, and you're dead.
scream, and you're dead.
Where's the girl?
are you okay?
Mick, are you okay?
deputy d. a. josh lindsey
confirmed that it was the testimony of leonora hayes
that clinched the trial. charges are also being brought against fayed
for the brutal safe house murders
of two l. a.p. d. officers--
good guys win. day is saved. you know the rest.
how's the arm?
Oh, okay.
it's all my fault. i'm such a klutz.
lucky thing you're so good-looking.
listen, i'm, uh...
I'm rry about before.
when you thought mick was dead, i,um...
I wasn't very understanding.
I didn't mean to accuse you. i was just upset.
it all worked out okay.
we make a pretty good team, don't you think?
maybe it was her blood in my veins
that let me feel her,
the beating of her very-living heart.
or maybe we've always been connected.
either way,
being near me puts her in danger.
I wanna help people.
it's why I became a P.I.
I heard what you said.
that I'm a vampire.
so do you bite people's necks and suck the blood out?
actually, I-I get most of my blood from the blood bank.
what about daylight?
daylight's not good, but the longer I'm in the sun, the worse I feel.
it's gonna get dangerous, Beth.
then it's a good thing I got you around.
my wife turned me on our wedding night.
you're the first human that I've told any of this to.
so, yeah, I trust you.
what do you do when the one thing you need to save your life...
is the one thing that would make life unbearable?
you're probably wondering how someone like me ends up near death in no-star motel hell.
hard to believe it started just yesterday.
21 HOURS EARLIER
blood is life for vamps and humans alike.
it warms us and thrills us, helps us heal,
but vamps will always be jealous of the living,
like renters versus owners.
you can make your own blood.
we've got to beg, borrow or work it into the budget.
day 16 of the murder trial of arms dealer Amir Fayed brought few surprises
and no real progress for prosecutor Joshua Lindsey.
Fayed is accused of murdering Jack Toland,
an associate who was later revealed to be a police informant.
since the federal racketeering case fell apart last fall, deputy d. a.Lindsey says that this murder trial may be the last chance to bring this monster to justice,
but the defense has painted a solid picture of Fayed as a diplomat,
philanthropist and most importantly, an innocent man.
with reasonable doubt running high,
Lindsey will have his hands full this Monday as the trial nears its end.
this is Beth Turner for Buzzwire.
your confidence in me is overwhelming.
I think I was overcompensating with the dry and factual.
I was afraid I'd start babbling about how hot you are.
so what do you have cooked up for Monday?
what are you talking about? - Please.
all the late night calls, the cat-that-ate-the-canary smile?
maybe I'm cheating on you.
who would cheat... On this?
good point.
come on. I know how you work.
you wouldn't be this cool unless you had an ace in the hole.
a secret witness? - Yeah, right
this place might be safe, but it's never quiet.
what's up with all the helicopters?
crime never sleeps.
so we can't either?
there's a good deejay spinning down the street.
who wants to go clubbing?
Yeah, let me just put my bling on.
fine.
I'll just read my trashy tabloid, if someone remembered.
you're of little faith.
thank you, officer Colden..
good night. - Sleep well.
Hey. It's Leni.
can you talk?
everyone's got an opinion. You know, gas, propane.
who cares? I hate barbecuing.
but anna's parents-- they like that mesquite crap.
man, you gotta go with the gas line.
who is it?
Oh, yeah. Hey. My name's Eli.
I live down the hall.
I'm sorry to bug you guys, but I shelled out for the pay-per-view
Gonzales and Whittaker-- and now my cable's gone all wonky.
can you check yours?
sorry.
go! Go! Go!
go! Go!
some couples just aren't meant to be together.
take me and Beth.
she has a very real boyfriend, and, well, after coraline...
I have understandable trust issues.
still, when i see it's Beth calling...
I always pick up.
Hello? - Mick, hey. It's Beth.
hadn't heard from her in a week,
ever since i trusted her with the charming story of
how my wife turned me into a vampire on our wedding night.
now Beth wanted to come over.
Josh. - Oh, thanks.
an i'm sorry about crashing your sunday morning, but i wouldn't do it if it wasn't an emergency.
well, you're here now, so...
I know we didn't exactly get off on the right foot,
but I've heard good things from Beth.
I'm glad the buzz is good.
what's your point?
I wanna hire you to find someone.
a witness has gone missing.
don't the cops work for you?
they do, and they're running their own investigation,
but there's a leak somewhere,
and i need someone outside the system to find her.
I actually had to drag Beth here.
she didn't want me to bother you.
okay, tell me about your witness.
this mean you'll do it?
no, it means i'll listen.
Hey, you came to me.
her name's Leni.
she was the nanny for Amir Fayed's daughter.
the arms dealer?
Yeah, and she's only 22, but smart.
leni was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
she saw fayed murder one of his guys, jack toland,
and she's been in a safe house in hollywood for the last month.
last night, they were hit.
I need you to find Leni and bring her back to testify.
okay.
two cops protecting her were d. o.a.
they were good guys.
an hour later, and i would've taken over graveyard shift for Nagawa.
I probably wouldn't use that tertom day if i was you.
I thought i told you to take the day off today.
I wanna help catch the bastards who did this and help get Leni back.
then go back to my office and give kevin your statement.
who's he?
he's none of your business.
we think there must have been a couple of shooters.
there was only one.
smoke makes a good silent partner.
we don't think any of this is Leni's blood.
it's not. There's no estrogen.
Beth said you had an interesting way of working. - Yeah?
she also said it's never boring around you.
if an attack came from the front,
leni was instructed to go out through the kitchen service entrance and then down the back stairs.
but she didn't.
what makes you think that?
well, there were bullets flying that way.
you think she went out the window?
Yeah.
she cut herself on the latch on the way out.
sir?
Yeah--just one second.
she went this way.
this guy's good.
somehow i thought you were exaggerating.
what did you find inside?
Beth, remember our deal.
come on. I waited outside while you walked him through the scene.
leni's trail ends at a spot just past that dumpster.
the freshest tire treads are something big--a truck, s.u. v.
Colden. drives a truck.
well, can you put an a. p.b. out on it?
better yet, he had it lojacked. I'll get a warrant for the records.
we're running out of time here.
best I can do.
look, I gotta get back to my office.
keep me informed. - Yeah.
warrant's gonna take too long.
tell me somethin' i don't know.
Steve, it's Beth.
I need you to tap into the lojack system.
find me the current location of a truck registered to richard Colden..
okay, she steals the cop's truck to get away.
why would Leni come here?
there's no record of friends or family to hide out with.
Dalton avenue sounds so familiar.
I think i've covered a story here once.
so what's your deal with josh?
Oh, we've been together for a while.
he's smart, funny, um...
no, no, no. I meant your deal from the alley.
Oh, right.
quid pro quo.
he's really worried about this leak, thinks his calls are being tapped.
I'm a clean line of communication with you.
so what's in it for you?
the story of Leni's safe recovery.
sounds like a conflict of interest to me.
Post-verdict. It's all legal.
Hey. I've been covering my boyfriend's cases long before i met you.
so how long can you stay outside?
like, how much sun is too much?
any is too much.
you're a delicate flower, Mick st. John.
don't you have a job or something?
Yes. Today it's following you.
after last time, what with the incinerator and the stakes in the heart,
I wasn't sure if I was gonna see you again.
it was a lot to process,
but I'm--I'm glad you told me about your wife turning you and...
Yeah.
I think this is it.
whose house is this?
I don't know.
I think Leni knew where the spare key was. Hold that.
why would Leni come here?
to clean herself up.
and to get some protection.
okay.
so the mystery owner has a gun, bandages, subpar housecleaning skills.
Mick, this is Jack Toland's house.
the guy Fayed's accused of killing?
I didn't know Leni knew him.
nobody did, not even Josh.
she was his witness.
why would she hide something like this?
looks like they were in love.
if that was true, maybe she kept it a secret so her testimony wouldn't seem biased.
let me see that.
164 las cruces lane.
it's in victorville.

rapid trek bus lines.
Yeah, can I have the times for all the l. A./Victorville buses today, please.
wait a moment, please
Yeah.
thank you.
well, this is where we go our separate ways.
why can't I go with you?
because this girl is scared, and she has a gun.
besides, you're my contact to Josh, remember?
I know, it's just that being on the hunt with you is kinda fun.
Yeah, it's a giant thrill ride that never ends.
you know, sometimes, it does end...
with terrible screams and bloodshed.
still... We make a good team.
come on. Come on.
try this one.
swap you. - Thanks.
you got a problem?
no, but you do, Leni.
who are you?
I'm mick st. john. I'm a private detective.
Josh lindsey hired me to get you back to l. A.safely.

okay, come on. Come on in.
Mick seems pretty confident he can get the jump on her.
seems like he could get the jump on just about anyone.
Josh, I just got this pic-- Beth, hey.
when are you gonna dump this stiff and run away with me?
Oh, I think one D. A.'s enough for me.
Ah, but you'll always wonder if it was the right one.
did you get anything from the call log?
10: 30 last night, officer Richard Colden. called a cell phone paid for by none other than Amir Fayed.
are you serious?
Colden. called a hit on his own safe house?
Yeah, frickin' dirty cop on the take.
I doubt if he expected to be part of the body count.
looks like our leak was plugged.
if Colden. was our leak.
you think there was more on the force?
I don't know, but either way, I wanna follow up on the cell phone call.
Yeah. Hi. This is deputy D. A.Lindsey for judge Howard.
I need a warrant.
Yes, I know he's on the course.
I'll get backup. I'll meet you out front in five.
well, make sure he gets back to me. I need this today.
when I get thirsty, I start to see blood everywhere.
even the damn tomato juice made me think that
maybe I'd found a vamp-friendly vending machine.
Oh, thanks.
so why were you working for Fayed anyway?
I was his daughter's nanny.
it's not Mara's fault her dad's a sociopath.
what happened?
I went downstairs to get mara a glass of water, and I heard shouting.
it was the night Mr. fayed found out that Jack was talking to the cops.
he just lost it.
right there, in the living room, he just...
shot him.
I couldn't even scream.
I mean, it was like I was frozen.
Probabebly saved your life.
Oh, I see what you're doing.
trying to be all friendly, all you can talk to me.
I already told you, i'm not testifying.
you went to the d. a. You wanted to testify.
you cared so much about this guy.
don't you want to see some justice for him?
Jack. This guy?
his name is jack.
and i got him killed.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
he's not just some thug.
he was a good guy trying to go straight. - For you.
Yeah, for me.
the human heartbeat is always there in the background,
but i finally understood the strange echo i'd been hearing
a smaller, faster heartbeat.
you're protecting the baby.
how did you know i'm pregnant?
it makes sense.
you ran instead of calling josh because you knew that
it wasn't just your life that you were risking anymore. Right?
the guard at the gate should have told you. Mr. fayed isn't home.
well, if he isn't, he's violating the terms of his parole.
got a warrant.
Hi.
Hello? - Beth.
it's mick. I'm with Leni.
Oh, thank god.
she was in victorville. - Yeah.
she's scared, but i think she's gonna let me bring her back.
why wouldn't she want to come back?
she's pregnant.
you gotta handle her carefully, mick.
reassure her.
Yeah, well, it's not really my forte, but i'll try.
okay. I'll get josh.
Josh. It's mick.
Mick. All right, sit tight.
I want to have local c sopescort you guys in.
what do you think?
Yeah, yeah, i worked a case with them last year. They're good men.
okay, victorville p. d.will be there within an hour.
an hour?
you know what? I don't need an escort, okay?
I'm better on my own.
that wasn't a request.
you okay?
Yeah, uh, i'm almost three months in.
I heard it gets better.
it's all gonna get better.
you got kids?
no. No, i don't.
well, if it's a boy, maybe i'll call him mick.
you should call him jack.
Jack's a good name.
I want justice for jack, but...
look at me.
you come with me.
I'm gonna protect you both. I promise.
okay?
okay.
let's go.
my lawyer's on his way.
M. B.A. from Stanford.
figured you could read a simple warrant.
it's not bad enough you torment me in court.
now you invade my home on a sunday? - Home?
it's more like visiting day in san quentin.
cell phone records. What is this?
we're investigating a suspicious call made to your cell phone.
cell phone i pay for.
there are dozens-- my family, my staff, my associates.
well, how about we get your associates' cell phones out here on the table right now?
and what will that prove?
maybe nothing. Maybe a lot.
ringers on, fellas.
Hey. You're Mara, right?
I'm Beth, a friend of Leni's.
I miss Leni.
she used to take me to the beach.
well, she's safe. - I know.
how do you know she's safe?
I'm not supposed to say.
if my dad found out...
he's really mad at her.
Oh, that's okay.
I won't tell your dad. I promise.
did Leni call you last night?
it was my birthday.
can i see your cell phone? - Yeah.
thank you.
Josh, it's me.
don't say anything.
just come outside.
officer Colden. didn't call this number.
leni did.
car 17, please report your e. t.a.
car 17
Mr. st. john? I'm officer clark. Victorville, p.d.
supposed to give you an escort back to l. A.
I told the D. A.I didn't need an escort.
I just know what I was told.
must be hot in that jacket today.
I never get hot.
cold as ice, huh?
something like that.
your girl ready to go?
Yeah, she's resting up in the ladies' room. I'll, uh, I'll get her.
you know what?
she's a little overwhelmed at the moment.
why don't you wait here?
sure.
you're telling me Leni used Colden.'s phone to call mara?
Yeah, a phone her dad pays for.
so that call had nothing to dowith the safe house hit.
which means there's still a leak.
call mick. Tell him to get Leni out of there.
I tried. The call won't go through.
excuse me?
what's going on? Why did we steal a cop car?
to put miles between us. Damn it.
still no signal. - Between who?
us and the guy sent to kill you. - What?
how did he find us?
doesn't matter. Now it's about losing him.
what?
you had to piss off an arms dealer, didn't you?
look out! - Hold on.
get out. - What?
do it. Get out, get out.
shut the door.
great.
are you okay?
Yeah, just a little freaked out.
are you okay?
Yeah, I will be, as soon as we get out of here.
you think we could trust them?
I'm probably gonna regret this, but we're not gonna stick around to find out. Come on.
Thanks.
well?
that was victorville p. d.on the way to the bus station,
they found a fresh accident scene.
apparently, mick and Leni stole a police cruiser.
they were attacked.
looks like they're dead.
dead?
there must be some mistake.
the car was in flames. It's too hot to even get close.
I'm sorry.
are you okay?
you got a big problem.
Mick didn't talk to anyone but you and I.
are you suggesting that I'm the leak?
I'm saying someone on your team is responsible, and you should find out who.
when I was still human, I survived the battle of the bulge.
six weeks in a trench in the ardennes.
the coldest winter I ever felt.
my buddy lost a foot to frostbite.
I thought that was hell.
I was wrong.
you look dehydrated.
do you wanna stop for a while?
we can't.
vampire survival instincts are simple.
if you're dying, you need blood.
doesn't matter that I'd sworn to protect Leni and her baby.
if I can't get blood any other way, I'll have to feed on her.
I won't be able to stop myself.
Mick, look.
um, maybe you should lie down?
find the ice machine. Get a lot.
please. Go.
ice.
I raided the honor bar.
for you. - No.
we have to get you to a hospital.
this is not just regular dehydration.
something is seriously wrong.
no hospitals.
just keep trying to get a signal.
call the number I gave you.
ask for Beth. Just talk to her.
only Beth.
who is she?
I trust her.
Hey, is she your girlfriend?
no.
it's complicated.
is there anything else I can do?
Mick. Please, you must leave.
no, I want to stay here with you.
call Beth.
go.
Beth turner.
Hi. It's Leni.
are you okay? - Yeah.
is mick all right? Can you put him on the line?
um, mick's not doing too good.
we had to walk a couple miles to get to this old motel and...
it was hot.
but he's alive? - Yes.
he's alive.
t-tell me where you are.
Mick, I spoke to Beth. She's coming.
Mick? Did you hear me?
Beth's coming.
get out!
get out, Leni! Get out now!
what do you get when you put a vampire in the desert?
maybe no more vampire.
you wanted to see us?
Yeah. Come in.
we just heard from lieutenant wetherly that the cruiser was nuked, but there are no signs of bodies inside.
I know.
Beth just called them. Our witness is safe.
that's great.
victorville p. d.will babysit tonight, bring her in first thing tomorrow.
St. john's giving 'em a debrief on what happened.
what the hell did happen?
Leni, I'm Beth.
you have to help him.
where is he?
in here.
I think he's dying.
stay here.
stay with me.
stay with me.
you're burning up.
I bit her.
I died before I feed on her.
Mick, Leni's in the other room. She's fine.
I guess... I guess I am a delicate flower.
I guess you are.
take Leni back.
get her out of here. He's coming.
I'm not leaving.
you have to protect her now.
you're dying.
I don't know how to do this, but i know you need it. So...
no.
get out. Get out!
you need blood.
no, not yours.
look. - Not like this.
I want to do this.
what do you do when the one thing you need to save your life is the one thing that would make life unbearable?
I know you won't kill me, and I know you won't try to turn me, either.
I've got this vampire friend who's been explaining this stuff.
at some point, you're gonna have to stop me.
victorville p. d.till 06:00 tomorrow.
you want the address?
Josh, man, I-I can explain.
Really?
cause it looks like you just dialed one of the numbers fayed pays for. - I got in a little bit over my head.
you know, march madness is...
this guy came to me.
he told me he could give me a clear slate.
we're friends, man.
that just makes it worse.
scream, and you're dead.
scream, and you're dead.
Where's the girl?
are you okay?
Mick, are you okay?
I feel--I feel better.
deputy d. a.josh lindsey confirmed that
it was the testimony of Leonora hayes that clinched the trial.
charges are also being brought against fayed for the brutal safe house murders of two l. a.p. d.officers
good guys win. Day is saved.
you know the rest.
how's the arm?
Oh, okay.
it's all my fault. I'm such a klutz.
lucky thing you're so good-looking.
listen, I'm, uh...
I'm sorry about before.
when you thought mick was dead, I,um...
I wasn't very understanding.
I didn't mean to accuse you. I was just upset.
it all worked out okay.
we make a pretty good team, don't you think?
maybe it was her blood in my veins that let me feel her the beating of her very-living heart.
or maybe we've always been connected.
either way, being near me puts her in danger.
so it has to stop.
I wanna help people.
it's why I became a P. I.
I heard what you said.
that I'm a vampire.
after last time, what with the incinerating... And the stakes in the heart,
I wasn't sure if I was gonna see you again.
it was a lot to process.
some people just aren't meant to be together.
Beth has a very real boyfriend, and after my ex-wife coraline, it's hard for me to trust someone again.
I know we didn't exactly get off on the right foot, but I've heard good things from beth.
I'm glad the buzz is good.
she also said it's never boring around you.
vampires can be in the daylight, but too much of it will kill us, and our survival instincts are simple. If you're dying, you need blood.
no, not yours! Not like this!
at some point, you have to stop me.
there. If dr. Rosin says it's okay, it's okay.
feel better now? - I felt fine before.
well, I feel better.
that is one weird cut. I mean, two.
it was pretty crazy out there in the desert, wasn't it?
Yeah, a little.
it's strange that mick hasn't even stopped by since, at least to see how you are.
I'm fine.
it's just, for a while, it was like he was there every time we opened the door, and now he sort of disappeared.
it wasn't something i said, was it?
sorry. What?
if I've learned anything in 89 years, it's that what you want...
watch it.
doesn't always matter.
sorry.
you can want to get from here to there.
you can want to be on time.
you can want to avoid someone for their own good because say, you drank their blood out in the desert.
but if the universe wants something different... well, you can run, but you can't hide.
Hi.
we were just talking about you. - Yeah, we were.
what are you doing here? - So what are you doing
Oh. We're, uh, here for a blood test.
a blood test? Are--are you two
getting married? No, no.
uh, for this. Josh thought I might have tetanus. You know, from the chain-link fence?
so what are you doing here? - Same. Blood... work.
I-I-I have to get some blood work done.
you know, I left you a message.
actually, she left four.
I must have missed that somehow.
well, you know now, so call when you get a chance.
Yeah. - Or better yet, come by tomorrow night.
we're having a few friends over to celebrate one year together.
Oh, I don't think-- mick doesn't wanna...
no I would, want to, uh, but I can'T.
I'm sorry. But congratulations.
that's, you know, one year, that's, uh, that's really something.
Thanks.
see ya.
there's what we want...
then there are the million coincidences we have no control over.
the events that put us in a certain place at a certain time and change our lives forever.
who controls these coincidences?
all I know... it's not us.
Oh, no, honey. I just can'T.
not with you.
so run along, and we'll call it even.
you know, your picture was a lot prettier.
Hey, wake up, girl. We got a live one.
recipes?
Oh, josh and I are having some friends over tonight.
coq in a reduction sauce"?
it's french for "chicken." - Still.
you said you had a live one?
Oh. Dead, actually. You're gonna like this.
an escort? - Mm-hmm. Juicy stuff, too.
my source said, "a very distinctive M. O.
you think this is... - like the san francisco guy, yeah.
the way this has been in the news brings out all the perverts.
look for a copycat angle.
I'm all over it.
you know, the degree you like this stuff almost makes me uncomfortable.
Mick St. John Private Investigations she came out here to be an actress.
she was in "our town" in tenth grade.
she was the main one. You know, the one that does all the talking.
suddenly we couldn't reach her.
all her letters came back, and her phone was disconnected.
I'd heard the same story for decades.
small-town beauty leaves home looking for excitement and gets it.
used to be it ended with her dancing in a cage on sunset or if she was lucky, living in some apartment paid for by a gentleman three times her age, but lately, I'd been hearing something else.
people all over town knew, but...nobody told us.
we were the last ones to know.
that she was on the internet as an escort?
we tried that number, but she never called us back.
and they review them on the internet, like sows at auction.
I'm gonna find her for you.
I promise.
Thanks.
Hey, everyone, back.
Hey, no pictures.
cameras off.
come on, guys. we need to keep everybody back.
take a little private jobs.
Hey.
Hey, I said everyone back. Beth, come on. You know the drill.
who are those guys in suits?
Oh, they heard the apartment's available. Thought they might take it.
are they F. B.I.? - No comment.
can I quote you on that?
look, we're dealing with a serious situation here.
I need you to back off, okay? Please. For once.
is it like san francisco-- the escort killer there?
a copycat or did he come to L. A.?
all right, everyone back. Coming out.
is that why the F. B.I.'S here? He's come to L. A.?
Beth, you know what you need?
you need an "off" switch.
so your reporter friend. Uh, what's her name?
you know her name. - Yeah
so how's it going since, uh, happy hour?
fine.
Oh, knowing you, it means you're avoiding her.
you're a romantic in the abstract, my friend, but the reality of fang on flesh...
look, you said you could help me find the missing girl.
did I? - Yes.
what do you think rider's here for?
your new valet? - No, maestro of all things telephonic-- rider england.
Mick st. John.
I hear you're looking for someone.
right.
What'd she do? She break your heart?
no, her parents'.
well, she requires references. You know that.
Yeah, I'm not looking to hook up. I-I just need the address.
no problem.
you hear that? No problem. - No problem.
boy, a lot's changed in 400 years.
Yeah, there's no regular cathouses anymore.
Yeah, another casualty of the digital age. Now it's categories.
blondes, asians, busty, mature.
equestrian.
choice, choice, choice. It's very efficient, very american.
you sound almost nostalgic.
whatever happened to the good old days of four girls on a street corner undercutting each other?
okay. Here we go.
wilshire corridor.
God, these pros do love their high-rises.
thank you, gentlemen.
all right, listen up.
to you both, together a year now. - cheers.
Hey, wait. I'm not through.
is anyone else dying of thirst here?
to you and to that moment you first met.
okay, don't even
the only two cars in a parking lot the size of rhode island collide.
you said let an insurance adjuster call it an accident. I call it fate.
so... to, um... - insurance adjusters.
fate. - To fate.
Cheers.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm kind of expecting a call right now.
Hey.
Yeah, I'm good.
uh, yeah. I c--I can tonight.
um, maybe in, like, two or three hours?
right now? No, I-I'm--I'm kind of in the middle of something.
no, no, I want to. Okay.
I'm sorry about that. I've got this weird case I'm working on.
I've got a window to get into the morgue tonight.
you'd rather be at the morgue?
no, not "rather." It's just...
you know, I can-- I can probably get in tomorrow morning.
no, it's okay.
if you have to, you have to.
thank you for being so understanding.
Yeah, I'm so understanding.
okay, you're mad. - I'm not mad.
well, you're something.
look, you have to admit, it's pretty rude.
those are your friends in there.
now you invite them here, and then he calls, and you bail.
who calls? - Mick st. John.
that wasn't mick st. John. That was a contact I have at the morgue.
well, what would you have thought?
I saw the way you two looked at each other when we bumped into him.
Oh, for goodness sakes. - Honestly,
I couldn't miss it.
now is not the right time to have this conversation.
not the right time? It's our anniversary.
one year together, and I cooked the chicken for you. Your friends are here.
I said I'll be back as soon as I can.
you know what? Take your time.
normally, vampires don't have to frequent women in the trade.
between willing freshies and your basic vamp appeal, there's just no need, but this was different.
a vampire had been here.
even through the door, I could smell it.
struggle, resistance and ultimately, defeat.
and it wasn't just the victim.
it was the vampire who did it to her.
you gotta hurry. My boss will be back any minute.
it won't take long.
what are you looking for? - I'll know when I see it.
why haven't they identified her?
Mm. They have, kind of. - Not according to this.
well, she had one of those stripper names, you know.
we give her e"ane do"j until we find out who she really is.
Oh, my god. He did this?
you think it's funny?
Hey, you pay me 50 bucks to see a dead girl naked.
I assume you're up for anything.
you're sick. Do you know that?
Shh. It's my boss.
good evening, sir
you sure you want to do this?
we have to know.
okay.
I'm sorry.
it's not her. It's not her.
freedom.
everybody's gone now. You can get up.
what are you doing here?
I was just about to ask you the same thing.
no, the person hiding around the corner in the other room gets to go first.
there is a sexual predator on the loose.
I don't know if "sexual" is the right word, but there was rumors about an odd M. O.
a biter? - That's an understatement.
I don't mean to cast aspersions, but I think it might be a, uh...
it's a vampire
an extremely frustrated and dangerous one.
so your turn.
what? - What are you doing here?
you tracking the same guy? - No, I'm looking for a missing girl
the daughter of that couple I was with. She's working as an escort.
not this escort?
no. They said that this is the girl that their daughter came to L. A. With after high school.
they were roommates, I guess.
so wait a second. You brought those people here, thinking they were gonna see their dead daughter?
first, I went to a condo, thinking I'd find their live daughter, but that happened to be a crime scene.
which crime scene? - Wilshire corridor, 87
18? - Yeah.
that's how I ended up here, too.
I'm freezing. Let's get out of here.
okay, I'm just gonna say it.
don't you think it's a little weird, us running into each other here?
not really. What do you mean?
I mean, you've been avoiding me.
no, I haven'T. - Yes, you have.
ever since... you know, the desert, you've been dodging my calls, avoiding me, and then we run into each other twice, first downtown and now here.
following two completely different paths, we end up in the same place.
don't you think that's a little strange?
you know what? I'm not big on categorizing things into strange and not.
Wow. Vampires make really bad liars.
go on. Admit it.
I just don't think we need to make this into a big deal.
it is a big deal. I fed you.
you were dying out there, and I brought you back to life with my blood.
with my blood. Mick, now we're here, together.
what do you want me to say? Huh?
What--what do you want me to say?
I want you to admit that something happened between us.
okay.
okay, something happened.
if you're gonna say it like that...
so what if I called you back, huh? What then?
what do you mean? - You understand that I'm a vampire, right?
Yeah.
and don't you have some dinner that you're giving?
all I'm saying is that I'm here, and so are you, and there must be a reason.
help me track the killer, and i think you'll find the girl.
yeah? - hi, cherish.
who is this?
I'm a friend of your old roommate.
huh. How is she? - Good. Never better.
she says hi. - Really?
cause we kinda had a falling out after she swiped my old web site.
Yeah, she's sorry about that.
she said I should give you a call.
look, I'm private now. Not really into expanding my circle of friends.
I could offer a substantial donation.
500 roses? - Okay.
per hour? - Fine.
and you're sure natalie won't get all skeezy about this?
I promise you, she won't say anything.
you'd think by now you'd know how to spell "predator.
Marissa. - So was the morgue exciting?
I'm sorry I had to bail. - Don't apologize to me.
apologize to the man who burned the coq.
is he mad? - No, not really.
that's kind of the point.
what's going on with you two, anyway?
what do you mean?
you've been together for a year, and yet you're not even living together.
we have sleepovers. - Exactly.
don't you think it's time to get serious?
I am serious. - About stiffs in the morgue.
is there someone else? - No.
Really? - No.
no. Where--where is this coming from anyway?
I thought you said josh and I were fated.
fate's fine, but at some point, the human's gotta step in and make it happen.
fate's not gonna get the extra keys made and move your stuff into his apartment.
I mean, if that's what you want.
the universe sends you a sign, and you just...
you see? That's a sign, but you gotta answer the call.
it's not josh.
the dead escort's name was natalie hall. Professional name jazzmyn, two z's and a "Y.
voted "most likely to succeed" by her high school class.
not sure how the others fared, but that's seeming unlikely at this point.
favorite quote-- "have fun in the sun, get laid in the shade.
careful what you wish for, right?
Josef, rider, meet beth turner.
Beth turner, "buzzwire.
Oh, such beautiful women on the internet.
thank you...
I guess.
so are you gonna tell me what I'm doing here?
Mick said you had a great voice.
rider here has got a list of all of the incoming calls to the dead escort's web site during the last 24 hours of her life.
one of them is probably the killer.
so you want me to call the numbers? - Quick study.
and what, talk to him? - If we're lucky, yeah.
what am I supposed to say? I've never spoken to a serial killer before.
Oh, you know, be polite. You know, "please," "thank you.
just do whatever-- - whatever escorts do?
Yeah. - Okay.
whatever you want.
Hello? - hey.
who is this? - It's me--jazzmyn.
Oh, you.
so, uh, I was thinking... - what? What were you thinking?
you know.
no, I don't know, you idiot whorebag. I told you never to call me here.
I messed up. - No, you didn'T.
I ruined it.
you didn'T. It's fine. It's not him.
he thinks she's alive. He's not who we're looking for, really.
you were, uh, I mean, she was...
very impressive. - hot. Very, very hot.
next?
Hello? - hey.
cherish? - Is that--is that you?
are you there? - Yeah, I'm here.
where else would I be?
still on for today, right? - Can't wait.
that's why I'm calling you. - Good.
I'm really glad. You seem really nice.
we're gonna have a blast.
so... - yeah?
see you at greenies.
wait. W--he hung up.
that's weird.
kind of reminded me of high school.
sounds like he wants a girlfriend, not a hooker.
does anyone know where greenies is?
I've never heard of it.
I'll poke around.
meanwhile, call was traced to a landline. 1730 los feliz.
if the plan is for today, you might wanna hurry.
let's go.
so your friends-- are they, um... - what?
you know. - Vampires?
can't tell, can you?
scary.
1730 los feliz
it doesn't sound like
get your hands up! Turn around. Turn around.
let them go!
put your hands on your head. Now!
all right, all right.
sure. Why not?
finally, it's you. I saw your picture.
just sit down, okay?
uh, you know what?
can you get me a double?
do you have any idea how close you came to getting shot?
do you have any idea how close you came to getting your face ripped off?
I never understood what it is about humans and yelling.
not that I don't appreciate that flushed, blood-in-the-face look more than I used to, back before I became a vampire.
it's just that whatever relief elevating your blood pressure brings causes you to miss things-- important things.
you got that?
what's that?
I don't know. Looks like some old photo.
looks like old hookers or something.
could we just stick to the case here, not waste time on some stupid-ass picture?
the feds have this guy nailed.
he's a loner, 38 to 45 years old, tortured animals as a child, wet his bed.
that freezer? It's a place to keep trophies of his victims.
38, huh? - It's 38 to 45.
profiling's not an exact science. - I'll say.
they said we can go.
he's a kid, maybe 16 years old. - 16?
well, going on 200. I saw a picture.
Ugh, awkward age. - You're not kidding.
you know, boys that age think about sex 20 times a minute, and that's a scientific fact?
times two centuries, that's gotta take a toll.
shouldn't we tell the police?
well, he's a vampire. It's probably healthier all around if we don'T.
Oh, my god. Natalie hall.
this belonged to the dead escort.
just keep it hidden until we're in the car. They're still watching us.
look.
that's her. That's the girl I'm looking for.
you think he's with her? - There's a good chance.
Greenie's?
there's a number on the back. - Call it.
so what's the deal? You a virgin?
depends on what you mean.
I mean, would I be your first? - My first?
not really.
how old are you?
I said.
21, sure. I mean, really.
Really?
197 1/2.
look, you seem like a nice kid.
are you sure that...
Hey. Don't answer it.
okay, okay. Just...ugh.
it went to voice mail.
it's a public place at a crowded pier. She should be okay until we get there.
how far is it anyway?
it's just at the beach. We're almost there.
so we can go on the rides, play some games.
rides? - Yeah, the roller coaster's killer. You'll love it.
I don't have time for all that.
come here. - You can wait.
I want you closer.
so how does it work, anyway? - What?
just, you know, the sex thing.
your parents never told you?
they somehow skipped the part involving vampires.
vampires and humans, I mean.
Oh, I'm talking totally hypothetically, believe me.
kiss me.
like you mean it.
you wanna know how it works?
it doesn't, okay? It doesn't work.
so it's impossible?
it's not impossible. It's inadvisable. It never ends well.
never?
we're almost there. You should check that number again.
okay.
maybe you should just calm down.
you know what? Maybe you should just do what you're paid for.
I'm out of here. - Do not answer that.
yeah?
do you have her? what's going on?
I can't tell. Listen.
Hello? cerish now give me the phone.
anybody there? - you come with me!
this way.
I can hear you. I know what you are.
I know why you're doing this.
the bordello. Is that it?
who turned you? What did they do?
are you there? Let her go. I know you want to.
who are you?
who are you?
my name is mick st. John. I know you're a vampire...
where did you get this number?
like me.
Oh, like you, huh?
I know what you're going through. - Oh, you know?
is that right?
I know that you feel cursed, like fate has played a cruel trick on you, like you're gonna wake up one day and realize this was all a mistake, but you don't wake up, not as the years roll by, the decades
centuries, mick. 200 years.
I didn't choose any of this. It was done to me.
you can always choose.
sure.
let go of me. Let me go!
you don't have to do this.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
leave me alone.
that guy was gonna kill me. - It's all right.
it doesn't have to be this way.
I know what you're going through.
like
you think so? You think you know?
couldn't possibly.
I mean, you were turned at what, 30?
I'm stuck.
all I've ever wanted is to grow out of this, and I won'T... ever.
someone betrayed you.
Oh, you think?
you're not the only one.
have you ever loved someone completely?
so that she was your whole world?
you'd do anything she asked, anything at all.
have you ever loved someone that way?
so you forgot about yourself and all you thought about was her?
I love you forever.
forever. forever, yes.
see, I never have.
if I've learned anything in 89 years, it's that what we want doesn't always matter.
you can want to get from here to there.
you can want to survive, but if the universe wants something different, you can run, but you can't hide.
Hi.
where are the cameras? You're missing the moment.
they don't want this public.
beautiful escort nearly killed, reunited with parents
that's just about the juiciest story we've ever had.
she doesn't want to be on the internet.
since when?
I gotta go.
maybe it's the sum of a million coincidences we don't quite control that brings us to a particular place at a particular time.
or maybe it's the choices we make, the actions we take.
if there's one thing I've learned in 89 years, it's that what we want-- it doesn't always matter.
you just took off.
Oh, uh, you were kind of tied up with your editor.
you could at least have said good-bye.
good...
Bye.
what we want doesn't always matter.
but then again...
sometimes it's all that does.
I wanna help people.
that's why I became a P. I.
22 years ago, I took a case that changed my life forever.
someone took my daughter.
everything's gonna be all right.
you're not gonna do this.
over the years, I tried to stay close, in case she needed me.
we make a good team.
Beth doesn't remember me from back then, and I'm the one who rescued her.
were you married?
she's dead.
how did that happen?
you don't know, do you?
I get shot.
occupational hazard.
and even though I don't ha tveo worry about lead poisoning, there is maintenance to be done.
aside from silver buckshot, vampires can actually just leave a bullet in.
bullets, shrapnel-- it doesn't matter.
but try getting through a metal detector with that in you.
our skin reforms-- perfect.
clean slate.
but those old wounds-- they still ache sometimes.
in an internet news exclusive,"buzzwire" is one of only five...
you humans have your own coping mechanisms when something goes wrong.
some of you obsess, some become vengeful...
charismatic cult leader and mass murderer donovan shepherd's long stay on death row comes to an end in just 20 minutes...
and of course, some of you block the whole thing out.
officials had hoped that staging the execution at midnight would reduce the number of clashing death penalty protestors
more importantly, the number of what shepherd calls his "family.
D. A.Quinlan, do you feel that justice is being served tonight?
Absolutely.
this man ruined a lot of lives.
hopefully, his death will provide some closure.
why are none of the people shepherd calls his "family" being admitted into the chamber?
the law doesn't recognize a bunch of fanatics as family members.
only relatives of the victims of shepherd's rampage, including the lone survivor
a brave young woman named audrey pell.
thank you.
it was ms. Pell's testimony that sealed shepherd's fate.
she was only 10 years old when she hid in a closet and watched him murder six people, including her parents.
ms. Pell?
I'm beth turner.
I'm not giving any interviews.
Oh, I just--I just wanted to see if you were okay.
I don't even know if I can watch.
does it feel like justice? - Yes.
I want shepherd gone from this earth for good.
thank you all for being here.
I know this is difficult, but I just wanna lay out what's going to happen now.
Mr. Shepherd should be done with his last meal by now, and he'll be given a chance to pray.
it's time, my son.
excuse me.
Hello, sweetheart.
I see you.
he can't hurt you anymore.
Mr. Shepherd will now be allowed his final words.
power can lead a man down a dangerous path.
it can blind him to things like reason, kindness, mercy.
I've had many years to think about my actions, my choices, things I've done.
I don't regret a bit of it.
I seek no forgiveness
just the blood of those who crossed me.
and you know who you are.
I will live on, and you...
will die screaming my name.
Donovan shepherd died by lethal injection at 12: 04 A. M.
his final words were no benediction.
I seek no forgiveness-- just the blood of those who crossed me.
I will live on, and you will die screaming my name.
Oh, this is lovely.
are you sure this is okay?
you barely know me, and I could just call someone that I know.
at 5: 00 in the morning?
don't be silly.
you don't wanna be on your own tonight. - Yeah.
so just make yourself at home, okay?
thank you so much.
Hello?
Hello, sweetheart.
I see you.
andrey, are you ok?
Beth, I saw shepherd.
honey, there's no one there.
donovandhepher s was out there.
you believe me, right?
Audrey, we saw him die.
look, you got an untraceable phone call from some idiot who freaked you out.
no.
he said the exact words he used 14 years ago.
Hello, sweetheart. I see you.
I never told anyone he said that to me, not even at the trial.
that means it had to be him, right?
maybe not.
you've heard of post-traumatic stress, right?
Oh, it's not my imagination.
no, I'm not saying it is, but maybe seeing shepherd at the execution brought back memories and made you hear those things.
you sound like you know something about it.
well, we have more in common than you think.
I was kidnapped when I was 4.
I don't remember much, not faces.
but I-I do have dreams...
and, uh, flashes.
sometimes they can seem very real.
so you keep reliving your past?
more like I block it out.
it's the only way I can keep sane.
I just...
I wanna feel safe.
come on in.
well, it sounds like you guys had a pretty rough night, huh?
what makes you think I can help?
well, I realized she might have actually seen someone out there.
shepherd has a lot of followers.
if you'd have seen the guys outside the prison...
I watched your report.
it certainly was a rainbow coalition of psychos.
it's chaos here as police escort witnesses inside...
see the guys with the infinity scars? - Yeah
they call themselves shepherd's "family.
so have any of these guys bothered you in the past?
there are always crank calls and letters, online stuff, usually when shepherd was up for parole, but no one has ever followed me home before.
Hey, it's okay.
I'm going to look into this, okay?
thank you.
okay.
it's my grandmother.
everyone's worried, like I'm made of glass.
excuse me. - Go ahead.
she's gonna stay with me tonight until we know what's going on.
she's really gotten under your skin, hasn't she?
Yeah.
there's something in her eyes.
it's like she hasn't had a decent night's sleep for 14 years.
I could have been her, you know, after the kidnapping.
you're a survivor, beth.
Yeah, but it's ironic.
Audrey's demon was in prison, and she never felt safe.
the police never found the woman who took me, but somehow I always felt safe.
so about tonight...
uh, I can park outside your house, keep an eye out.
I am a night person, after all.
no, I'll be okay. - Okay.
I'm gonna start online, check out shepherd's family.
so how do you know mick?
um, we worked on a case together a couple of months ago, and, um, we kinda stayed in touch.
and there's nothing going on there?
I only ask because I noticed the extra toothbrush in the bathroom.
Oh, that's josh'S.
who, your boyfriend?
Yeah.
things are a little...
iffy right now.
he's out of town.
I've kind of been, uh, distracted.
Oh, it's "buzzwire" again.
Beth, I don't wanna get you in trouble with your work.
if you need to go in, please go.
I'll be fine.
I'll veg out, watch "pride & prejudice" again.
okay, well, I just have to post the execution follow-up, pick up a couple of photos, and I'll be back about 10: 00.
get out of here.
see ya. - Bye.
Donovan shepherd was big for a while.
he had the grunge charm of kurt cobain and the media savvy of donald trump.
a lot of people thought he was the voice of a generation.
it's too bad he went manson in the end.
irony is, even after being executed for murdering six people, he's more popular than ever.
lot of lost souls took shepherd's call for blood seriously
family values at its worst.
1050 ventana was the address of the '93 massacre.
it was also the user name of someone who posted unlisted information on the D. A.
the judge, every jury member...
and beth's address.
where audrey staying
scream MY NAME
I'm back.
No! You're dead!
who the hell are you?
that's not the same guy I saw outside.
it's gotta be.
I'd pick him out of a lineup for shepherd.
he's even got the scar.
shouldn't we call the police?
I think mick wanted to talk to him alone.
you can't do this. I have rights.
yeah?
you broke into a private home.
I have the right to shoot you.
I'm still considering that option.
you're not a cop.
that's right, so I don't have to fill out paperwork in triplicate when I kick your ass again.
did you follow them home after the execution and call audrey?
no.
do you know 1050ventana. Com?
whose web site is that?
a prophet doing shepherd's work.
go ahead. Put me in jail.
others will come, continue the work, and she'll die.
you call your troops off.
I wouldn't know how.
you'll never know the love that shepherd teaches-- the loyalty.
so enlighten me.
soon you can see for yourself.
one of the biggest producers in town is a friend of shepherd'S.
he's gonna make a movie!
sometimes I hate living in hollywood.
I thought about being an actor back in the '70s, but I think I really just wanted to be steve mcqueen.
there is a difference.
producer's name was jerry drake.
I guess he's a big deal, but I don't really read the trades.
Hi.
is mr. Drake here, please?
maybe.
do you have an appointment?
to see him.
follow me.
boy.
too bad he couldn't afford the place with a view, huh?
do you want something to drink?
no, thank you.
horrible what happened on ventana drive.
it's funny how one tragedy can ruin a word forever.
Ventana" just means "window" in spanish.
and a "columbine" used to just be a flower.
so, mr. St. John, my time is money.
I know a lot of people say that, but I actually had my accountant run the numbers.
you're 10 grand in the hole.
wow, and me without my checkbook.
I'm interested in your donovan shepherd biopic.
Variety" said that you guys were friends, but I don't see those pictures on the wall.
Oh, we used to hang out in the '80s.
Donny was fun.
then, uh, I got a movie set up, and he got crazy.
so were you friends to the end?
enough to get him on the phone when I heard he was recording his memoirs from prison.
I thought killers couldn't profit from selling their stories.
you don't wanna touch that.
this feels real.
is this from that, uh, sword and sandals thing that you did?
Sparta. - "Sparta.
that's it. - Yeah.
still the highest opening weekend for a march non-sequel release. Look...
Donny didn't profit from anything.
that $800, 000 went into a survivors' fund, and buying his story was just good business.
so is inciting people to murder a part of that good business?
you didn't hide your I. P.Address as well as you thought.
guess I should've hired the web guy from M. I.T.
no, you encouraged those fanatics, and last night, one of them attacked audrey pell.
is she all right?
what do you care?
her murder would make a better ending to your biopic, right?
I did nothing illegal.
maybe we could find a part for you in the movie.
how about this?
anything happens to audrey, and your story is gonna have a whole different ending.
and I don't think you'll like it.
Jerry, here's les.
you must be something special.
he never has me hold calls.
is that drink still on offer?
it's always on until it's off.
wait right here. - Okay.
damn.
are you positive you're up for this? - Yeah.
shepherd's gone, but I still feel like I'm losing it.
if one of these mug shots is the guy I saw, then maybe I can finally get some closure.
Hey, beth.
how are you? - Good.
I think I've got everything we need.
is the D. A.Ready for us?
I just got back. Let me check.
Oh, my god.
he's back.
Audrey's, he's not. - No.
shepherd loves to set the scene.
this is how he would do it.
if he were alive, but he's not.
we just watched him die, remember? - No!
if I have done my work wisely and well, my story will have no final chapter.
father garza has told me time and again that it's never too late to change.
I say it's never too late to find a way to finish the work I started.
nobody saw or heard anything.
but all this blood...
Yeah, and there's no sign of a body.
you know, I really think he's dead.
what do you think is going on?
I think that shepherd's family is more loyal than we ever thought, and they have a sick sense of irony.
the D. A.Got special permission to keep some trial mementos in his trophy case.
one of them was the knife shepherd used in '93.
Yeah.
Hey.
we got a real problem.
I know. The D. A.'S gone missing.
he's probably dead.
well, he won't be the last. Where are you?
I'm--I'm headed for "buzzwire.
I'll see you there.
shepherd's fingerprints were on the bloody knife, but the cops assumed they were old, preserved from the original crime.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
listen to this.
shepherd's memoirs were mostly messianic ramblings, but a couple of days before the execution, everything changed.
like saul on the road to damascus, I've seen the light and been given a choice.
death is just a horizon, and I will rise like the sun.
blood is the key to death's locked door.
blood is the key? Is that about
Yeah, becoming a vampire. I didn't even consider it.
I mean, a vamp couldn't survive long in prison.
there's constant supervision, there's no access to blood.
so it's not possible?
it is possible if it happened right before the execution.
so how do you start a manhunt for a dead man?
you verify the "dead" part.
an executed man's body is held in the prison morgue for ten days.
if shepherd's gone vamp, I'll find an empty drawer.
okay. We've got a body.
found the D. A.
shepherd's risen, all right, and he is pissed.
when most guys have houseguests, the checklist is obvious.
anything moldy in the fridge?
any private magazines left out?
for me, it's a little more complicated.
the windows and doors are all reinforced.
the locks are 10-inch steel strike dead bolts.
there's electronic surveillance on the front door, so you'll be safe.
you'll have to excuse the mess.
I wasn't expecting company.
this is really nice of you.
Ah, mi casa es su casa.
that's spanish, by the way...
for "keep her out of my stuff.
don't you think she'd be okay with police protection?
I wouldn't be okay with it.
shepherd's a vampire. He knows what he's doing.
finding the D. A.'S dead body at the morgue has made carl convinced that shepherd's family is on the rampage.
good. Let him think that.
Why?
so long as the cops are going after family members,
I can hunt shepherd in peace.
in peace.
Yeah.
I have to go, but I'll be back.
Beth is gonna stay here with you.
now, um...
if you guys get hungry
we'll order in.
I would recommend not going into the office.
okay.
okay.
or upstairs...
or through the gray door.
wow, this all sounds so "alice in wonderland.
beware the bottles that say,"drink me," okay?
has last couple days, shepherd was on display like a lion at the zoo.
it's not the easiest place to turn a guy into a vamp.
had to be someone hiding in plain sight.
officer...
Mick st. John.
a P. I?
Yeah. The L. A.P. D.'S stretched pretty thin at the moment, bringing in a couple independents to help with the grunt work.
we already have guys looking at the crowd footage.
all I know is I'm supposed to watch shepherd's surveillance, look for any unusual activities.
it's probably gonna take a couple of hours, so if you could, uh...
thank you very much.
vampire visual comprehension is off the chart, so it won't exactly take hours.
the priest converted him, all right.
drained him at confession...
and turned him at final prayers.
so the priest turned him.
all those hours spent praying were prepping him for vamp life, explaining the bloodlust, how to get through the execution, escape the morgue.
that explains why he didn't eat his last meal.
Yeah, well, it wasn't what he was hungry for.
anhing good on?
every news channel's got mr. Quinlan's murder.
I'm sorry. I know you guys were friends.
we weren't friends, exactly.
he was just kind to me after shepherd killed my parents.
you were so brave to testify.
Yeah, I testified.
it still didn't get shepherd out of my head.
even now, it's like
it's like I have some horrible connection with him.
you need to break that tie, or he'll never go away.
is that what you did when you said you learned how to block out what happened to you?
um, sort of, but I...
I also had something to grab onto.
someone-- the man who rescued me, he was fearless.
it was terrifying.
but as long as I was in his arms, I knew I was safe.
who was it?
well... when I was little, I would call him my guardian angel.
when I was a teenager, I used to picture whoever I had a crush on.
you know, johnny depp, robert downey jr.
and all I got was a 60-year-old balding therapist named bob.
doesn't quite seem fair.
well, now you have mick on your side.
I feel safe with him.
given the complex history of religion and vampires, a church is not where you'd expect a vamp to find sanctuary.
bless you, my child.
forgive me, father, for I have sinned.
it's been about 36 years since my last confession.
well, I'm glad you understand it's never too late.
let's hope not.
well, let's see.
I cursed and lied to somebody I care about.
I'm pretty sure I broke a guy's forearm, too
the radius, the ulna, one of those two.
physical violence is a sin to be wary of.
it's a dangerous stepping-stone to darker deeds.
in the past week, I've drunk about 6 pints of human blood.
who are you?
I'm the one who wants a confession.
if this is about donovan shepherd, I didn't know what he was going to do.
when you turn a serial killer, it's not too hard to guess.
where is he now?
where is he now?
I can make you talk.
I'll answer your questions if you let me go.
why did you do it?
money.
for all their faults, humans got one thing right.
the $800, 000 drake paid for the memoirs.
so the survivors' fund is actually a swiss bank account in your name.
Cayman islands, but yes.
so shepherd and drake are still friends?
actually, shepherd hates drake-- really hates him.
he was always complaining how drake abused their relationship, screwed him over in the press.
Oh, jerry.
was that for me?
how--how are you here?
you wrote a check, and here I am.
look, donny, I...
isn't that what you do-- write checks and make people jump?
this time, your money brought back the dead.
you--you look good.
it's been 14 years.
not like you visited or called.
wait. You--you did call, as soon as you wanted something-- my life story.
I thought I'd come in person, give you some visual aids.
wh-what are you?
don't be so naive.
you make horror movies.
Oh, your movie's gonna rock!
to humans blood just smells coppery, like a jar of pennies.
but to a vamp, it's full of smells...
the fear felt when it was shed.
and the joy of the one who shed it.
Beth, what's wrong?
nothing.
is audrey all right?
Yeah, she's sleeping.
where are you?
Jerry drake's house. He's dead.
I think shepherd's coming after audrey.
do we need to leave?
no, it's safer there. I'll be back in ten minutes.
unfortunately, all that fresh blood in the air sometimes makes it hard to distinguish who's still here.
Hello, sweetheart.
I see you.
sorry. What are you doing?
Oh, uh, nothing. I was just, uh...
looking for something.
so you and mick
I know you say you've only known him a few months, but it seems like you've known each other forever.
why do you say that?
I don't know-- the way he looks at you.
can't explain it.
someone needs to.
nothing.
where is he? Have you talked to him?
Oh, man!
I'm trying him again.
sounds like he's back.
is it him?
stay there.
it's him, isn't it?
did he go up or down? - I don't know.
there's someone trying to break in.
go!
Where's audrey?
blood.
you don't seem surprised to see me alive.
I know what you are.
if you know what I am, why are you fighting when you should be begging?
where is she?
get out.
I thought you were dead.
looks like neither one of us is dying easy.
come on.
two vampires and two lovely ladies
in my day, we called that a party.
Yeah, well, I outgrew that phase.
come on!
close!
Hello, sweetheart.
I see you.
how is she?
sleeping.
what did you tell her?
as long as shepherd's gone for good, she doesn't need an explanation.
but I do.
I know who saved me when I was a little girl.
I think you've known for a while.
maybe I have.
what else do you know?
that he had to kill a woman he cared about.
maybe he would have done that anyway.
maybe.
but that night he did it to save me.
how was I supposed to tell you?
why did you hide it?
made me think it was my imagination?
you had every right to be angry.
I'm not angry.
I found my guardian angel.
I just wished...
I just wish he'd talk to me.
first, I murder my wife, and then I stalk you.
it just gets better and better, huh?
no.
I could've lived my life in fear.
but somehow I always felt safe.
and now I know why.
now you know why it can never work.
all I know is, ever since I met you,
I've stopped using the word "never.
you ever think about becoming a civilian investigator?
I did some investigating at "buzz wire," but I'm not a cop.
you don't have to be, but you would have to work for me.
Mick, Beth... this is Sara--Sara Whitley.
what happened to her?
he tried to turn her.
I fed her my blood, but it didn't work.
all these years, Josef, you were ranting about how it could never work between us and humans.
you gonna try and make your thing with Beth work?
children are a part of most normal human relationships.
our relationship being neither normal nor human.
but Josef was right. Vampires can't have kids.
I just didn't know how much I wanted a family until I almost had one.
family's not only about D. N.A.
tonight Hearst college honors Josef kostan, whose generous donation has made possible the sara whitley memorial sports arena, the new home of the Hearst college rough riders basketball team!
to commemorate this event, we're retiring the jersey of the young man who led our team to the national championship last year.
he may have gone to the pros, but he'll always be Hearst's favorite son.
ladies and gentlemen-- number 24--Dominic Michaels!
Josefostan celebrated as a civic-minded entrepreneur?
definitely worth putting on the monkey suit for.
and of course, there are the fringe benefits.
this is great. I feel like I'm back at my high school prom.
you know, prom wasn't really big back in the 1700s...
high school, either.
the plague--the plague was big.
so what's your connection to Hearst?
did you attend the college? No, no. I founded it.
lost a bet with william randolph.
I like the dress. - Oh, thank you.
is it valentino?
civil service doesn't pay quite that well. - Right. Thank you.
so how's the whole civilian investigator thing going?
I don't think Mick likes your new boss.
he's still trying to decide if Talbot has romantic intentions towards me.
Oh, nice. Mick's not usually the jealous type.
speaking of jealous...
Ooh, don't worry. Mick isn't suicidal enough to hit on my date.
your date?
let me guess-- she was born to Hungarian aristocracy in 1715, danced "swan lake" with the Bolshoi Ballet before you turned her?
actually, Simone was born in reseda, 1980, and nobody turned her.
your girlfriend's a human?
she's not my girlfriend.
she's one of my lawyers-- quite an up-and-comer, and a very willing source of liquid refreshment.
you drink her blood?
usually only on Tuesdays and Fridays, but she wanted to come to the party.
Simone, this is Beth turner.
Mick was just telling me about you--all good things.
Josef's just told me about you, too.
well, if you'll excuse us, time for a drink, and, uh, the champagne just ain't cuttin' it.
and we'll be right back.
she just lets him drink her blood?
Yeah, it's not uncommon. A lot of vampires have, uh, human... donors.
we call them "freshies."
is it like a paid arrangement, or friends with benefits?
well, it depends on the circumstances.
so I s--I suppose you've had freshies.
I've been a vampire for over 50 years now.
I take that as a yes. How many?
I don't know off the top of my head. Not many.
rough guesstimate? - Back, hank!
Dominic, don't!
cool off, hank, or get out. All right?
who are those two?
it's Dominic's managers-- Emma and Jackson Monaghan.
they've got Josef courtside seats to every laker game since wilt chamberlain played for them.
Dominic's managers are vampires?
Yeah. They've been married for something like 150 years.
150 years?
that gives a whole new meaning to "till death do us part."
you want to dance?
Yeah.
150 years with one person?
that seems like a long time.
well, it depends who you're with.
how long were you and coraline married?
technically, 33 years, and that did feel like a really long time.
but here you are, dipping your totoin the dating pool again.
do you realize this is our fourth official date?
define "official."
any outing that doesn't involve dead bodies.
you are such a romantic. You know that?
it's Dominic.
I didn't do it.
I guess this won't be our fourth date after all.
D. A. Talbot asked me to speak to you.
that's right.
and Mick told me that you work for the D. A.'S office.
and you used to be a reporter?
I think we can both agree that I've got a pretty lame story.
I wouldn't want any of my clients going to court with it.
but I didn't kill Dominic.
you told Talbot that he was already in the tank when you found him.
I was trying to get him out. I mean, it was...
stupid and--and too late, anyway.
so why didn't you tell Talbot you were with Josef?
because we were, uh...
and then afterward, I...
I went to the bathroom to get cleaned up.
but at least if you were with Josef, it gives you some kind of alibi.
but then that would give the police a reason to look at Josef more closely.
I can't risk that.
I mean, you know what it's like.
keeping their secret is the number one rule.
it's weird talking about them with someonelse.
we're members of a very exclusive club, you and I.
I know it's none of my business, but your arrangement with Josef...
are you ever afraid that he'll go too far, that he'll accidentally turn you?
Josef's careful, although, yeah, sometimes I...
I do wonder.
you'd want him to turn you?
no. I mean, no, of--of... of course not.
Beth, can I talk to you for a minute? - Thank you.
did she tell you anything new? - No.
look, if there was some kind of kinky gone wrong in the hot tub, she should just say so.
why do you think there was something going on between Simone and Dominic?
Dominic's coach said she came to all his games.
she even left with him a few times.
sounds like something to me.
have you interviewed hank bishop yet?
he and Dominic got into it at the party.
no, he was gone by the time the cops got there.
they're still looking for him.
how long are you gonna keep her?
till I figure out what she's hiding.
$100 million worth of architecture, and all the papers talk about is Dominic's death.
at least I get a write-off.
Where's Simone? - Talbot's still holding her.
he's not sure if Dominic's death was an accident or not.
he said Simone knew Dominic.
well, she never said anything to me.
Talbot thinks they were sleeping together.
well, we're not exclusive.
and anyway, what Simone does when she's not with me is her business.
how very egalitarian of you.
wow, that's a big word.
look, forget Simone. Okay, there's too many vampires mixed up in this.
look, don't worry.
we'll find out what happened to Dominic before the cops start asking the wrong questions.
we'll start with Emma and Jackson, Dominic's managers.
good. I'm going home.
it's past my bedtime.
Josef's upset.
I think he's jealous, and that blood isn't the only bodily fluid that he and Simone are exchanging.
it's hard to believe he'd get that involved.
with a freshie?
especially with a freshie.
Josef has his rules.
Josef said you'd be coming by and that you're-- how shall we say-- friend of the family.
I guess I am, yeah.
so I saw you with Jackson at the party. How did you two meet?
Oh, I came over from Ireland during the famine, buried my family there.
I was turned on the ship, never even saw who did it.
how horrible.
Yes, well, my brother was a boxer.
so when I landed in new york, I went to the fights, searching for something familiar, and Jackson was there.
the moment I saw him, he felt like home.
he made you feel safe.
you know, he didn't care what I was.
that's how I knew he was the one.
so he let you turn him?
he wanted to be with me... forever.
just wish I'd known about the snoring first.
so... after all this time, no regrets?
no, not one.
150 years later, I can still remember exactly what Jackson was wearing the night we first met.
so what were Dominic and hank fighting about at the party?
Hank was on the Hearst team with Dominic.
they would compete for everything--playing time, girls, you name it.
any particular girls?
Dominic was sowing his wild oats.
do they still say that?
he wasn't mature enough for anything serious.
do you think hank is capable of murder?
Dominic made the big time.
Hank thought it should him there was a lot of bad blood there.
that's beautiful.
gettin' soft after all these years?
Hearst was in my march madness bracket.
this guy helped me win the office pool.
can't a man grieve?
C. O.D?
neck snapped.
accident or murder?
not sure, but I was wondering about all the vamp smell on him.
well, he was around a lot of vampires last night.
Dominic had sex right before he died.
Yup. Crime scene guys found blood on him
pretty degraded from the chlorine and other chemicals in the water, but the type was b-positive--not Dominic's.
so it could be his partner's.
can you get ahold of that blood sample?
Gary the forensic hematologist owes me serious for march madness.
make yourself at home. - I always do.
what are we celebrating? - Simone's release.
the D. A.Can only keep someone in for 24 hours without probable cause.
but they haven't cleared you yet.
and that's your job.
I really appreciate you and Beth's help.
right.
what exactly was your relationship with Dominic?
I did some work for his family and ended up following his career pretty closely.
yeah? You never told me that.
well, I didn't want you to get the wrong idea. - What? Did he hit on you?
occasionally. - Really?
but then again, Dominic hit on every woman he ever met.
I always turned him down.
Yeah, well, the police found blood on Dominic's body...
B-positive.
you see? There you go. Simone's cleared.
I'm b-negative.
still, I think we should give the police a sample.
look, there's a much easier way to settle this.
Josef, don't.
here.
for professional purposes only, of course.
Hi, Beth.
we were just having drinks.
I can see that.
we should go.
but this is so awkward.
I love awkward. - I know.
the police found blood on Dominic's body.
I was just making sure it wasn't Simone's.
they have laboratories for that.
Beth-- - no. Stop.
I have a lead on hank bishop.
he's the guy Dominic was fighting with at the party.
are you coming with me or what?
so the police already checked this place out, but I thought you might pick up on something they missed.
I assume you don't want to talk about what happened.
why would you assume that?
because you haven't said a word to me since we left my apartment.
well, what do you expect me to say?
I wasn't feeding on Simone, okay? It wasn't a big deal.
then why do I feel like I walked in on you two making out?
we were not making out.
I only want to make out with you.
Yeah, but you don't want to drink my blood.
whoa, you want me to drink your blood?
where is this coming from? - No, I don'T...
it's just that when you were dying in the desert and you feed on me, you made it seem like it was a big deal, and now you're saying it's not, so please forgive me for being a little confused.
Oh, god, I should've worn my hazmat suit.
Hey, don't touch that. It's sacred. Members only.
we're looking for hank bishop. - And you are?
I'm Beth turner from the D. A.'S office.
well, then you already know what I told the police.
Hank hasn't been around here in a while.
I wish I could help you, really. The guy owes me, like, 50 bucks.
how long since you last saw him?
not since last semester.
he got a place of his own in palms maybe you should check over there.
you're lying. Where is he?
Hank, the cops are here!
go! Go! Go, Hank! Go!
stop!
play nice.
are you okay?
Yeah, well, I got hit in the face with a sacred ass paddle.
karma.
Hey, I got your text.
Hey, I scored that blood sample from whomever Dominic was with in that hydrotherapy tank.
great.
it turns out, it's not contaminated after all.
the coroner just doesn't know vampire blood when he sees it.
humans getting busy with vamps, always trouble.
that it is.
trouble with Beth?
well, she thinks I fed on Josef's freshie.
so? It's not like she's volunteering.
I don't want her to volunteer.
why not?
well, 'cause I don'T.
I'm just saying vampire es got needs.
why do I even talk to you about this stuff?
you've obviously blocked out all memories of what human women are like.
Yeah, well, I need all available brainpower to figure out vampire women.
it's a shame about Dominic.
Yeah. Emma and I have been managing him since he graduated.
he would have been great in the pros.
everyone loved Dominic.
I saw Dominic with a blonde cheerleader at the party.
Yeah, Dominic was, uh, Lisa's boy du jour.
it wasn't serious.
you know her?
met her in new york back in 1923, I think.
she was a flapper then.
she's a vampire?
and loving every minute of it, let me tell ya.
I didn't get close enough to her at the party to tell.
did Dominic know?
no, no, of course not.
he didn't know about any of us.
all right, guys, good practice.
you must be Mick.
how have we not met before?
it's a cruel world.
I heard you're looking into Dominic's death, that maybe it was murder?
Yeah, or an accident.
somebody get a little rough?
they found vamp blood on the body.
not mine... not that night.
you were sleeping with him, though?
we hooked up once or twice.
I'm into jocks this semester.
so how long you been in college?
40 years or so.
it's the perfect life for a vamp.
nobody notices when you sleep all day, and there's a constant rotation of frat boys too drunk to know when a hickey isn't a hickey.
no one notices the puncture marks in the neck?
that's not the artery I go for.
okay, hank, let's go over this again.
I didn't kill Dominic.
then why'd you run?
it's not safe here. You gotta protect me.
sure, but listen, who exactly are we protecting you from?
from her. She killed Dominic
threw him around the room ke a rag doll, snapped his neck like it was nothing.
so you weren't feeding on Dominic?
no way.
he took our team to the tournament three years in a row.
he needed his strength.
Emma was careful, too. At least, I never noticed anything.
wait a minute. Emma? Emma, Monaghan?
Dominic was sleeping with his manager?
Yeah, for the past few months.
did Jackson know?
not from me. No way I'd get in the middle of that.
and then I saw her face-- her eyes.
well, who is it? Who--who'd you s?
it was Dominic's manager, Emma.
Hey, listen, hank says he saw Emma monaghan kill Dominic during rough sex.
we're gonna go pick her up.
I think Dominic may have been with Emma in the locker room.
and hank saw her kil him.
LTalbot's on his way to her office now.
stop him. - How? What am I supposed to say?
I don't know. Anything. Just stall him.
well, he's just bringing her in for questioning. What's she gonna do?
well, I don't know, but I don't think Talbotwants to find out.
then you have to get there first.
I'm on my way.
No! No!
Emma, stop!
no, I will not go to jail!
Emma, Emma, put the chair down, okay?
are you here to help me or them?
you okay?
Emma, stop it. Stop! stop!
this is not how this goes. You know that.
I will not go to jail.
okay, we'll figure that out, but think about what you're doing.
you're endangering all of us. Think about Jackson.
I guess we know whose side you're on.
how did she do all this?
psychotic break, maybe?
definitely psychotic.
Yeah, but I just... I thought hank was exaggerating.
well, that wasn't so bad.
a homicidal, desperate vampire is in custody, and she's gonna need to feed soon.
it's very bad.
so this is what 150 years of marriage looks like.
check out these wedding licenses.
they've got a new pair of names every 20 years or so.
Yeah, one thing about being a vampire-- you get to reinvent yourself over and over again.
but no matter who they were or what they did, they always stayed togethe it's so romantic.
they probably have a double-wide freezer as well.
Emma said Jackson asked her to turn him, that he knew it was the only way they could really be together.
well, at least Jackson had a choice.
what about you? Have you ever turned anyone into a vampire?
sorry, uh, all we got is tap.
we don't have many humans over to the house.
that's fine. Thank you.
thank you.
so you didn't know about Emma and Dominic?
never suspected a thing.
but like they say, no matter how long you know someone, you never really know 'em.
I thought we were happy.
how long can Emma go without feeding?
she wouldn't do anything stupid.
you sure about that?
she just needs to know that she's not alone, that we'll figure this out.
let me talk to her.
can you get him in to see her?
Yeah.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
why can't we hear them?
they don't want their conversation to be overheard.
they're speaking below audible hearing levels.
you can hear them, right?
Yeah.
I never meant to hurt you.
What'd she say?
she's telling him she's sorry.
he was sleeping with Lisa.
I got angry. I forgot my strength.
then when Dominic told her he was seeing Lisa, she lost control.
he was dead before she even realized what she'd done.
did you love him?
of course not. It was nothing.
so you threw away everything we built together, everything we were to each other
y-you betrayed me for-- for nothing?
it wasn't about us... or you.
it was about me.
being with Dominic, it made me feel young...
until he dumped me for a younger model.
if only he knew the truth.
I'm sorry. I know I sewed up, but it was an accident.
this is first-degree murder.
that is life in prison.
I will never survive that.
Josef already has a lawyer working on your bail. It won't come to that.
no, it won't.
St. John sided with the humans.
he's the one that let them put me in here.
what's wrong. - He will get me out.
you go out there, and you tell him if he doesn't...
not only will I tell the cops exactly what I am, but I'll tell 'em I'm not the only one.
Emma, that's crazy. - You tell him that I will do it.
I will give up his name, all of his friends, every vampire in los angeles.
you have 24 hours.
what's wrong? What did she say?
but how could the judge deny Emma bail, hmm?
whatever happened to innocent till proven guilty?
Emma is guilty.
I know, but Simone made her sound innocent.
and halfway through her speech, even I was buying it.
doesn't matter. I've already made some calls. We're gonna work this out.
good.
you know, Simone looked a little green when she left court today, like, uh, she might be afraid you would blame her for the judgment, and by blame I mean...
no. I told her it wasn't her fault. I'm not mad.
she likes you, you know.
who doesn't like me? She tell you that?
she didn't need to, and I think the feeling's mutual.
now doesn't that violate one of your rules?
Yeah, several.
I-I'm so sorry. I know I should have called first.
no, that's okay. Come in.
you know... about the other night, I just...
I just feel like I should apologize. - No, no, no. It's okay.
I was just upset. It.just looked kind of, uh...
intimate? - Yeah.
feeding them blood? I mean...
I think it's intimate, but to them it's just...vampires don't care about humans like that.
we're just a blip in their life span.
to love us is to... watch us die.
so... when are you gonna break it off?
I don't know yet.
Oh, you really care about this person...
even though she's a... human.
we were out one night.
Simone might've been a few martinis in, but...
well, she implied she might be interested in not being human anymore.
wait a minute. You're actually considering this?
look, I haven't tried to turn anyone since sara whitley, and we all know how that worked out.
so you're--you're worried you'll kill her.
I don't know. Maybe I'm worried I won't.
forever's a long time, Mick. I mean...
and I've got commitment issues.
do you think it would be different between you and Josef hife turned you, if you were both vampires?
I mean, it didn't work for Emma and Jackson.
but at least they had 150 years to try.
wouldn't you want that with Mick?
Mick would never turn me.
he's a kind of anti-vampire vampire.
well, I mean, I don't--I don't know how he feels about it now, but if you're with him long enough, I guarantee the topic's going to come up.
can we talk?
right now? It's not a good time.
what's going on?
Oh, let me guess-- vampire busiss.
you can't be involved.
no, I guess I can't.
what was that about?
nothing.
you should never have allowed the police to take Emma into custody.
what was I supposed to do?
let Emma kill a couple of cops, maybe a D. A?
collateral damage.
no. Not to me.
uh, Emma's pretty well-connected.
gotta have the names of at least 300 vampires in the area.
anything she says, the cops'll think it's just nuts.
until she turns vamp and starts slicing through guards like butter.
I've sent out the coded e-mails, but there's-- there's not enough time.
a lot of vamps aren't gonna be able to get out of town.
which means when the cops come, they'll fight, exposing even more of us.
it's gonna be a freaking" vampire apocalypse."
no. Emma's not gonna say anything to anyone.
you're gonna do it? You're gonna break her out?
no. We are.
Emma is being held here at the district processing facility.
she gets transferred from the processing facility to the county lockup.
the transport van is scheduled to pick up at 8: 00 P. M
for the approximately 18 minutes that she's in transit, she will be under minimal protection.
that means one guard, one driver.
the transport van's route will take it up main street, by which time, Logan will have hacked the city's traffic control mainframe.
I will?
Yeah. You're gonna make sure the lights at 3rd and main stay green as the van approaches.
Guillermo, I'm gonna need an ambulance, a stretcher, the works.
no problem.
and bring a couple pints of blood.
road snacks?
jackson said Emma hasn't fed in over 72 hours.
she's gonna be in bad shape.
got it.
Hello, ladies.
what do you want us to do?
you clean up accidents every day.
now I need you to create one.
as the van passes through the 3rd street intersection, you guys are gonna be waiting for it.
main street is a one-way street.
the van will have to stop where we want it to stop.
Josef and I will be waiting to extract them.
we pack her in the ambulance and take off.
questions?
can my code name be lando calrissian?
let's go.
all right. I am in.
okay, do it.
green lights all the way.
excuse me.
what is it?
the restraints-- they're too tight, and I feel sick. Please.
fine. Let me check 'em.
right on time.
wow, you're really cold.
I'm very thirsty.
uh, I hit a secondary firewall.
the city must've upgraded their system.
I need time to pop it. - You've got ten seconds.
Oh, that's helpful. That's definitely gonna make me go faster! Thanks!
Hey, logan--Calrissian out.
Logan, get that light green.
they've gotta make it through the intersection.
how much longer? She doesn't look too good.
I think there's some kind of accident up ahead.
flip the lights and take us around.
we need to get her to a doctor fast.
what's he doing?
what's plan "B"? - There is no plan "B.
Hey, calrissian! Stop that van!
Leeroy jenkins!
Oh, yes! I am the man!
did you see that? That was awesome!
quite the plan "B." - I'll say.
get up.
Emma monaghan, for threatening to expose your brothers and sisters, you have endangered the safety and security of the entire community.
wait!
you can't do this. It was an accident.
this isn't about the human.
our secrecy is all we have.
it's all that keeps us alive.
the crime is treason. The penalty is death.
continue.
stop. Back away now.
give them a minute.
don't do anything foolish, Mr. Monaghan.
I am so sorry.
I-I wanted to start over... with you.
I love you.
always have and always will.
we're ready.
go, Jackson. - No, no, no.
no, we do this like we've done everything else-- together.
No! No! No! I don't want you to die, too.
Mr. Monaghan? - Please.
together.
we're ready.
we don't have to watch this.
yeah... we do.
no, sir, we don't know how she escaped.
we're investigating that as we speak.
I'm sorry, sir.
okay, bye.
Talbot.
file's for your eyes only. We'll be in touch.
who is this?
I assume your "vampire business" meant getting Emma out of jail. Where is she?
she's dead.
she was a liability to our community.
vampires dispensing vampire justice.
there have to be rules, Beth.
and Jackson?
he didn't want to live without her.
so they were both just executed?
I know that this isn't easy for you to understand.
look...
you've been saying for months now that things can't work between us, that we live in different worlds.
and I didn't want to hear you, but maybe you're right.
you can't come back to my world...
and I'm not ready to join yours.
wait. You think that that's what this is about?
you think I'm gonna want to turn you?
wouldn't you? Eventually?
and what happens when I start to get old?
maybe then I'd want it, too.
I don't ever want to have to make that decision.
Emma and Jackson made me realize that you were right.
I don't think I can do this anymore.
but you want to know what Emma and Jackson made me realize?
that you were right.
you were right all along.
this isn't about being a vampire or a human.
this is about us and how we feel about one another right here, right now.
the night that we first met-- or met again, whatever-- what was I wearing?
blue jeans, white striped shirt, cream jacket.
what about my shoes?
you were barefoot.
how can you remember that?
because I love you.
from the very beginning, we have wondered how life began what our purpose is and where we are headed.
we have struggled to understand time, matter, the infinite universe, who we are and if we are alone.
great minds have imagined the most wonderful and the most terrifying answers to these questions.
we invite you to join us on this great expedition.
are these events so impossible to forget that they become too painful to remember?
forgot to shave this morning.
sorry to hear that, doctor.
Gail?
this is hard, Deanna.
let's see if I can make it easier.
the cancer has metastasized.
H. E.R.- 2s are through the roof, and treatment prospects are poor.
sorry.
it's not your fault, Charles.
feels like it is somehow.
so what do you think, three to four months?
sure.
you're a better doctor than you are a liar.
see you next time.
if I can work it in.
come in.
I'm not sure I'm in the right place.
you are. Please sit down.
want some water?
no, I'm...
did I have an appointment?
you're right on time.
I pride myself on that-- being punctual.
it's a lost art.
I've always said so.
and you are?
Dr. Evans.
this is...a hospital?
may I ask you some questions?
the nurse's station. They directed me.
I'd like to start with a little game.
game? What sort of game?
I want you to watch what I'm doing.
are you going to make that disappear?
what's under the handkerchief?
can we place a bet on it?
not this time.
let's see. A paperweight?
wonderful.
there.
you're not recording this, are you?
would that matter to you?
I simply want to know. Matter of common courtesy.
you're being digitalized.
these are cameras, are they not?
you're very observant.
I'm being observed.
we're both being observed.
do you like it here?
well, honestly, I haven't been here long enough to form an opinion.
how long have you been here?
tell me...
what you were doing before you got here.
before I...
I was at work.
and where do you work?
I. S.T. Worldwide.
that's a technology company. - That's correct.
government work? - Pentagon.
and what do you do there?
I run the company. I suspect you know that.
well, why do you assume I know?
it's hardly a secret.
what we work on-- that's another matter.
something you can't discuss.
suffice it to say that we're an indispensable part of this nation's defense.
well, I wouldn't want you to compromise any state secrets.
confidentiality is part of your work, too, doctor-- doctor/patient privilege and all that hokum.
excuse me.
so your job seems quite important-- lucrative, too, I guess.
that's a little personal.
I could retire before I turn 45, but I doubt that I will.
what about your family?
what about them? - Children?
look, for the life of me, I don't know what you're getting at, but for the record, I have been married for 13 years.
my wife is named Dorothy.
I have 2 children-- Margaret, 12, and Peter, 7.
we live in a 10, 000-square foot colonial. I drive a 2-seater.
I'm a redskins season ticket holder.
I don't eat quiche, and I loathe pointless small talk.
what's your name?
you obviously know my name. I'm Robert Havelmann.
is there anything else you'd like to know?
lots.
am I being interrogated?
is that what's going on?
what's under the handkerchief?
how in god's name should I know?
Hoold are you? - This is absurd.
it's a simple question.
I'm 41 years old. How old are you, doctor?
what year is this?
are you seriously asking - year, Mr. Havelmann.
it's 2007. Maybe you should pop for a desk calendar.
so it's 2007, and you're 41 years old. - That's what I said.
take a look in the mirror. - What?
please. The mirror.
my god!
what have you done to me?
what did you do to me?
but you agree there's no significant change.
you watched. Did you see any sign of progress?
the old man is losing his patience with us. - How does he think I feel?
maybe we ought to try another tack.
I need more time.
Thanks. So you still think there's a chance he'll remember?
I don't think he's forgotten.
on some level, he knows.
you'll have a hard time convincing Geslow of that-- or me, for that matter.
well, that's why I need more time. Just a few more sessions.
I know I can break through.
Deanna, you know how much I respect your work...
you think I've lost my objectivity.
presumes you had it in the first place.
not with Havelmann, anyway.
that's not even the point. - Then what is the point?
accountability. The truth.
he can't just keep pretending to disappear into the ether like this.
two number twos, nice and hot.
there you go. Thank you. Enjoy.
so what should I tell Geslow?
buy me a week.
he wants closure on this.
not as much as I do.
Deanna, there are so many other people here who need you
people in pain, people who've lost hope-- lives you could be saving.
you're a gifted doctor, and...
well, I honestly think you're throwing away the chance to make a difference.
I care about these people. That's why I'm doing this.
I'm doing this for them.
I need one more week.
I am so over vegetable lasagna.
hold on here.
Hey, no, you got my shirt. That doesn't even count.
no, no, no, no.
he got you. He got you. - I got you.
will, be careful.
come on!
Hi, dad!
you got me.
that's because you're it.
come in.
Hello? - Mr. Havelmann.
they told me down the hall - Come in.
what can I do for you?
I thought we could have a talk.
I'm sorry. Have we met?
Dr. Evans.
I was due for a checkup-- annual thing.
is that why I'm here?
you tell me.
U're what kind of doctor, exactly? - A psychiatrist.
then I'm definitely in the wrong office.
I don't think so.
what's this about?
I think you can answer that, Mr. Havelmann.
it's Pierce.
it's that S.O.B. Pierce. Am I right?
niles!
not now, Jerry. We're late already.
I need your support. - Yeah. Always.
tell me I got you in my corner. - Yeah, yeah, always.
let's get to that meeting.
I'm going after Havelmann.
I thought we agreed the strategy was to let him self-destruct.
we can't wait for that.
I don't think it'll be long. The man's a ticking bomb.
he's a lot smarter than you think.
Oh, you give him way too much credit.
he canned seidman this morning.
he smells rebellion in the ranks.
he's dangerous to us-- to this company.
we have to move now.
we wait till we go public, he consolidates his power.
you take your shot, Jerry.
I will not be joining you in this suicide expedition.
Niles... - Say what you like about roberts.
he has friends in high places.
Yeah, we all have friends in high places.
happy hunting.
I need to know if I can count on you to help me take this son of a bitch down.
Jerry Pierce was my right-hand man until he made a very serious miscalculation.
what happened? - He went off the reservation.
let's call it an aborted coup.
but you stopped him. - I fired him, yes.
but I don't know if that stopped him.
because? - Because I'm here, aren't I?
somebody is still gathering information against me.
do I detect a little note of paranoia?
you don't know the corporate world very well, do you, doctor?
no, suppose I don't.
it's not going to work.
I built I. S.T. I have a game plan.
I'm not about to see it derailed.
you believe strongly in maintaining your objectives.
that's what it's all about.
you chart a course, and then you stick to it.
No...self-doubt?
as a leader, first thing you learn
inconsistency invites disrespect.
respect. That's important to you.
respect, honor, loyalty, old-fashioned values
all in painfully short supply these days, I'm afraid.
how would you describe your values?
the fundamentals
God, the family, constitution, doing what's right.
what's right.
it's not a dirty word, doctor.
no. No.
if we spent a little more time protecting the fundamentals, we wouldn't be as vulnerable to our enemies.
sounds like a man ripe for politics.
don't laugh. I've thought about throwing my hat in the ring-- state legislature.
of course, there's a little empire-building to take care of first.
you're an ambitious man. Is that fair to say?
I only want what's due me.
I think we both want that.
I'm sorry?
Oh, let's just drop the chade, Mr. Havelmann.
it's really getting old.
you make it sound as if we've met before.
imagine that.
look, whatever this is about, we've got ten minutes to conclude it.
I'm due at my daughter's school at 11: 00.
she's in a play, and I promised Dorothy I wouldn't miss it.
promises like that-- that mean a lot to you?
if you had children, you'd understand.
if I had children?
I had two children, mr. Havelmann-- a boy and a girl, just like you.
only I don't have them anymore, because somebody killed them.
you killed them.
you killed my babies!
we ran Havelmann through the synaptical scanner.
that's dignosed toetect brain abnormalities, am I right?
for the most part, yes. But I had them adapt the program in a way
I believe amounts to a very sophisticated lie detector.
and let me guess.
this proves that he's lying.
no, not definitively, but it does prove that there's- - but what? What?
Deanna...
you've been banging your head against the same wall for damn near a year.
don't you see what he's doing? He's hiding.
he's cocooned himself into a dream world.
I don't know what's crazier-- him taking refuge inside his head or you thinking that any of this matters.
but there are moments.
it's almost like he's reaching out as if he senses a whole different reality.
Oh. Come on.
all you have to do is talk to him. He's lost his mind.
it's not as if he hasn't already paid the price.
he has to be held accountable.
he can't just get off scot-free.
you have until the end of the week. Then we put this thing to rest.
it's Wednesday. That's only two more days.
Warren, if I push him too hard, we might never get him back.
Deanna, we have to move on.
we can't afford to endlessly tie up ouresources on Havelmann.
you know the difference between us?
you've given up. I haven't.
I haven't.
my, uh...
my colleagues think they have a possible diagnosis of your condition.
my condition?
I wasn't aware I had a condition.
they think you exhibit symptoms remarkably similar to korsakoff's syndrome.
you ever heard of that before?
no doubt there was an "oprah" devoted to it.
korsakoff's syndrome is a rare form of memory loss.
there was a famous case of it back in the 1970s.
a marine sergeant by the name of Arthur Briggs
he was in his late 50s, good health, generally.
but somehow he lost his memory of any event which occurred to him after September 1944.
I don't know what this has to do with me.
I remember everything that happened to me right up until the time I walked into this room.
and that's precisely what Briggs told his doctors.
and to prove it, he told them that World War Ⅱ was going strong, that his unit was being deployed to the Philippines, and that he was 20 years old.
fascinating.
couldn't remember anything that happened to him for longer than 40 minutes.
he was permanently stuck in 1944.
very distressing, no doubt.
now can weet on with it? Where's the questionnaire?
what questionnaire?
that's why I'm here, isn't it?
to answer questions like, do I sometimes feel as if there were a tight band around my head?
and do I agree with the statement that these days I don't believe we have much to hope for?
do you? - Do I what?
believe we have much to hope for?
I'm not going to be forced from my position by a handful of young turks who don't know cutting-edge from cutting farts.
your colleagues didn't send you here.
then who did?
I envy you, Mr. Havelmann.
you don't even know me. - You never have to grow old.
you never have to watch your friends die.
you can still enjoy the music you love, the pleasures of a good meal, good sex.
you'll always be 41 years old.
not in 4 months, I won't.
you can create misery, but you don't have to feel it.
you made a clean escape.
I don't have to put up with this.
Yeah, you don't have to put up with any of it.
that's what's remarkable about your deception.
you are blissfully insulated from who you are, from what you've done, or maybe, just maybe, it's just what you want us to believe.
go to hell.
what was the weather like this morning?
do I really need to tell you?
it was a glorious spring morning.
68 degrees. Red buds on the trees.
is that so? - Good day.
take a look out the window before you go.
that's not possible.
I've been very careful with you up to now.
but that wall between you and your memory is coming down.
there's nothing wrong with my memory.
no, nothing, except that little ellipsis...
the 24 years that are missing.
to...this morning.
I don't remember discussing this morning.
That's--of course. We're beyond our window.
your attention span, it's shorter than Sergeant Briggs'.
who's Sergeant Briggs?
never mind. This morning. Tell me about this morning.
I got up at 6: 30, just like every morning.
Dorothy made me breakfast-- oatmeal, one slice of ham.
I kissed the children. I picked up my briefcase.
you were going to the office?
of course. Where else would I...
but you wound up here...
at the...hospital.
all right, I did.
how did you get here?
if you know the damn answer, then tell me.
the answer is you were already here.
that's absurd.
what do you remember before walking into this room?
there was a nurses' station. I got directions.
there's no nurses' station.
I'm quite certain. I
there is...no...nurses' station.
all right, I...
I could be wrong about that.
maybe we're finally making some headway.
I'm glad you see it.
the technology your company supplies to the government-- you don't like talking about that.
I'm forbidden from discussing the details of our proprietary patents.
okay, well, you have my permission.
really.
all right.
we managed a breakthrough in impulse beam weaponry.
satellite delivery, intelligent targeting.
intelligent targeting? - That's right.
Ah, I bet that's winning you some points on the hill.
it never hurts to have the support of those who control the purse strings.
actually, you might be happy to know that you sold your interest in the company for nearly a billion dollars in 2009.
is that so?
you cashed in your political chits as well
to run for a seat in the maryland state legislature.
maybe you could tell me who to bet on in the world series in 2010.
Oh, 2010?
if I'm not mistaken, it's the braves in six.
you are a deeply disturbed woman.
you have no idea.
so how does the fairy tale end, mother goose?
get your hands up. That's my wrap.
did you wash these?
I don't want that.
what?
you told me you wanted a... - No, no, no. Not mine.
did you wash these hands?
now he took mine.
why does he get chicken?
sir.
major, we're at defcon one. - Defcon one?
you've been ordered to the bunker.
I'm gonna decline.
it's not about saving you, Major.
it's not your call, one way or the other.
we're not launching? Tell me it hasn't come to that.
you'll be briefed at the appropriate time. Now get in the vehicle.
well, I'm not going alone. I'm gonna take my family-- my children, my husband.
we just need an hour.
you don't have an hour, and even if you did, there's no provision for you bringing anyone.
now please get in the vehicle. Discussion is over.
deanna?
mom? Mom!
Deanna!
mom! Mom! Mom!
Deanna!
that's how it started-- an international crisis.
not the first, certainly, but it was the last.
if you have a shred of decency in you, Dr. Evans
it's Major Evans. I work for the NSA.
whoever you are, I just want to go home.
is that asking too much?
you don't have a home.
none of us do. Our homes are gone.
our families are gone.
anything that ever mattered to us...is gone.
you're talking in circles. I- I don't know where we are anymore.
well, then I'll tell you
we're stuck here, 1, 000 meters under a hillside in virginia.
that doesn't make any sense.
I don't care what year you say it is.
you just showed me the view out of that window.
it's quite obvious we're not underground!
it's not a real window. It's a projection, a digital display.
then you admit you have been playing with my mind!
we're not underground! It's not winter!
Oh, it's winter, all right-- nuclear winter.
that was a view from a robotic camera 3, 000 feet above us.
welcome to the apocalypse, Mr. Havelmann.
I am going to see my daughter's play.
I am going to see my family now.
and I'going to report you as unconscionably abusive to your patients.
your family is dead, Mr. Havelmann.
that is a horrible thing to say!
not as horrible as the way they died.
this has gone far enough. You're a lunatic.
I just saw my wife less than two hours ago!
and so you've been telling me for ten months.
game's over, Havelmann. You never showed any pity. Why should you get any?
you're not a doctor at all, are you?
Deanna, what the hell are you doing?
Deanna, put the gun down.
Deanna, please, just put it
nobody's gonna save you now. Nobody.
now where were we? - Somebody help me!
you will remember, Mr. Havelmann, or you'll die trying.
I had a feeling something like this might happen.
what are you gonna do?
find a way into that room and stop her. What do you expect me to do?
there is an alternative.
what are you talking about?
you could let things take their course.
maybe she isn't the only one who's cracked under the pressure.
justice would be served, one way or the other.
the justice of naked revenge?
is there another kind left?
I don't believe you-- not a single thing you've said.
then I suppose that puts us on equal footing, except that I can prove that what I'm saying is true.
fine. Then by all means, prove it.
just put down the- - get back!
that's New York.
former population, 11. 3 million.
no survivors.
that's Tokyo.
sao Paulo.
beijing.
and that's London-- eight hours after the bombs hit.
the first few weeks, we had reports of pockets of survivors in Central America, North Africa, Australia.
but we lost contact with them.
as of now, we're not sure if there's any more than 871 people alive, all inside this bunker.
you're asking me to believe that I left home this morning, kissed my wife and kids and then stepped through some kind of time tunnel into a post-nuclear holocaust?
you're not listening to me, Mr. Havelmann.
you never really did hear me, did you?
you couldn't even hear your own experts when it might have made a differ.
we have a, uh...potential problem with the I. B.-8, sir.
what sort of problem?
it may be more... powerful than we intended it to be.
we're designing the weapons system of the future, Nate.
the more powerful, the better. Or am I missing something here?
group 5 ran the beta through 10, 000 sims.
every possible scenario, including the targeting of nuclear sites, missiles, power plants.
And?
we think the beam could unintentionally trigger all fissionable material within a radius of 60 miles.
you think, or you know?
we're not certain, but given the danger... - of course.
the potential...
I-I mean, if we don't solve this...
I'll read this immediately.
mansur blew the whistle, didn't he?
you had ample warnings. You just wouldn't heed theM.
there was a timetable in place. - A timetable.
do you think the competition calls a time-out?
so you ignored the warnings? - Of course not.
we tweaked the design. We built in safeguards, but we didn't veer off course.
right, and now you're looking at the result.
you're showing me a simulation to manipulate me, it's not a simulation.
there's a sea of corpses- - how stupid do you think I am, Major Evans?
you're not stupid.
no one ever suggested you're stupid.
there've always been pele like you, Major
people who don't understand that progress is our birthright, that the greatest danger is that we shackle our genius as a people.
if it had been up to you, you would've outlawed electricity, the automobile, the personal computer.
Oh, maybe I would've.
there. You've proved my point.
one day, it's the greenhouse effect, and then the next day, we're poisoning the oceans.
you live in a world of paralyzing fears and irrational paranoia.
if we surrender to that fear, we might as well be back in theave.
we are back in the cave.
I'll give you points for cleverness, major.
you really had me going there.
so what are you going to do, Mr. Havelmann?
are you going to walk out into the crisp, blue sunshine and congratulate yourself for making the world safe for democracy?
I think I've earned a certain measure of contentment.
well, it pains me to disappoint you, but you're not going to walk out of here.
by my watch, you have less than ten minutes before you cycle back to square one, before you tell me we've never met before.
Oh, I hardly think I could forget you, Major Evans.
you know, maybe I should put a hole through your brain right now.
the threat alone cod end your career.
if I picked up the phone right now, you'd be toast.
Really? Who would you call?
I think it's fair to say I've accrued some friends you would not want to tangle with
frankly, some of the most important people in Washington.
Mr. Havelmann, you are the most important person in Washington.
I've made my contributions, certainly, but there are a couple of hundred movers and shakers who might take issue with your assessment, not to mention the man in the oval office.
Mr. Geslow took over shortly after we arrived due to your diminished capacities, but he was never sworn in.
you were, and still are, the President of the united states.
it's designed to be impervious to attack.
it's the president's safe room in case the facility is breached.
you're telling me there's no way we can bust in there?
not without the kind of firepower that would put the whole facility at risk.
there's got to be something we can do.
there are 4 inches of case-hardened steel.
so?
we could use plasma torches. It could take some time.
do it.
we're in the president's office at t strategic emergency command bunker.
you should've made things a little more spartan if you wanted to believe that.
the appointments are all yours, Mr. President.
lavish, self-indulgent, personalized.
if I'm the president, what does that make you, the Secretary of assassination?
I was your psychiatrist.
you shared the most intimate details of your life with me.
and I cared about you, sir.
you know what's crazy?
part of me, even after all you've done part of me still does.
I ordered a retaliatory strike, is that it?
it was a preemptive strike.
you went against the advice of virtually all your advisors, including your Vice President.
you attacked with I. B.S-- first time they'd ever been used.
the one-minute war, you called it.
the I. B.Is a deterrent. Who would've...
what are you saying happened?
you wound up triggering nuclear explosions from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf.
six countries answered in kind.
and then...
Well...all hell broke loose.
why are you doing this, major?
is it possible you're actually a patient in this hospital?
more pictures.
I told you your family didn't make it.
they were at the western white house at the time.
you had the arrogance to think they wouldn't be in danger.
what the hell is this?
you had a robotic camera deployed before the korsakoff tightened its grip on you.
what kind of sick joke is this?
you watched this footage.
I was in the room when you did.
you cried like a baby.
that's Dorothy's ring. Who gave you this?
the remote found an inscription.
it also confirmed her D. N.A.
do I need to show you the children?
Oh, God.
is it coming back now?
what do you remember, Mr. President?
I have to know.
all of it! All of it!
do you remember ordering the strikes?
I believed in what I was doing!
protect the country, protect our way of life, protect the democracy.
I had a duty...a sworn obligation.
of course there'd be consequences!
you can't succumb to emotion!
Reports...three million dead...
40 million...a billion...
Numbers...incomprehensible numbers...
I considered the options.
I thought things through. I...
didn't back down.
I believed in what I was doing!
the democracy, the nation you protected...
it prevailed.
it's 871 strong.
mission accomplished, Mr. President.
there was a reason, Robert
a reason for what must seem like my unspeakable cruelty.
the people will survive.
the world will start again.
and they will look back to this moment and they'll be reminded that none of us can surrender our individual responsibility.
not those who lead, not those who follow.
it's all we have, sir.
it's all we'll ever have.
we still have audio, but we lost picture.
it's time now.
I wish there was another way.
no. Please.
good-bye, Mr. President.
Deanna...
you can't do this.
come in.
hello.
is this where I'm supposed to be? - Yes.
please sit down. - I hope this doesn't take long.
I've got to be at my daughter's school at 11: 00.
you don't like me because I don't smile for the camera.
you don't like me because I don't suck up to the press.
you don't like me because I make a lot of money.
but you love me.
because I'm one of the greatest hitters alive.
announcer: We're back in Milwaukee, and the sound you hear reverberating across the cities and farms of the great state of Wisconsin is the roar of the Brewer faithful for their longtime hero, Stan Ross.
and here he comes with that trademark arrogant scowl.
2, 999 hits to date in his illustrious career.
will this at-bat, July 29, 1995, against the rookie right-hander Billy Earll, be the historic moment when Ross joins only 20 other major leaguers in that elite 3, 000-hit club?
Stan.
you're gonna be the best-looking cat in the Hall of Fame, that's for doggone sure.
yo, scrub!
you want my autograph now or after I make history?
you ain't getting this hit off me.
this is gonna be your one career highlight.
you're gonna be a game-show answer.
well, I'll take "Kiss my Ass" for $1, 000.
make it 3, 000.
you hear that language on that rookie?
kiss my ass.
how about you, Ernie?
you're gonna tell me to kiss your ass, too?
why don't you suck my...
I'll show you what kiss my ass look like.
I'll show him. I'll put up this...
damn it, Joe! He know better than to get me pissed off!
announcer: No pitcher wants to be the one that gives up that 3, 000th base hit.
clearly Earll just sent that message.
a purpose pitch to get Ross angry.
come on, this is the one. You know what I'm talking about!
hope he trips and breaks his leg.
Uhh! -ANNOUNCER: Oh, my!
it's a vicious line drive off Earll's...
well, it's a bell-ringing base hit.
that's what it is.
Stan Ross is safe at first.
Hey, Coach, get me that ball.
that's the ball that got me to the Hall of Fame.
you want this ball, Ross? -Yeah. Thanks, man.
there goes your damn ball.
you see that, Coach?
you see what he just did?
he threw my Hall of Fame ball in the stands.
what's your problem?
back up. Back up. -Move, man!
you be out when I get back, or someone will have to pull a piece of baseball history out the crack of your ass!
what you looking at? -Make a move.
okay, I'll shrink your big ass.
you'll get some, too.
you saw what he did, Coach.
all right, guys.
that ain't gonna mean nothing.
get back in.
who got my ball? Open that gate.
all right! He's coming on up.
Hey, congratulations, Stan! -[ Laughing ]
[ laughing stops ] -Give me my ball.
what? -WOMAN: What'd he say?
give me my 3, 000-hit ball.
don't look at your daddy. Give me my ball!
whoa, make him a trade at least.
give him your cap or an autographed bat.
I'm not trading him! -Hey, whoa!
what the... Are you all right, pal?
why don't you take his cotton candy while you're at it?
were you glad to get number 3, 000 here in Milwaukee?
sure. You ask any of the all-time greats, man.
we all got a special connection with our hometown fans.
what connection did you make with that kid who caught the ball tonight?
what you talkin' about?
people in that section say you threatened him.
I gave him good advice.
what the hell wrong with you people?
I just became a legend like Willie Mays,
Stan Musial, and Carl Yastrzemski.
y'all gonna try to speak on something negative?
that's what I'm talkin' about. That's why I'm quittin'.
what? -What?
what do you mean, quitting?
quittin'. I'm done.
hangin' it up.
now that I got this, I ain't playin' no more.
and that means no more talking to you stank-ass reporters.
excuse me? -That's right.
I'm talking to you.
and I said "stank-ass.
why now with the Brewers still in the race?
couldn't you wait until after the season?
I'd have quit last season if I didn't think you were gonna try to block me from the Hall of Fame.
but it don't matter 'cause I got mine.
3000
like it or not, I'm a certified immortal.
and there ain't nothin' you sons of bitches can do about it.
nothin'.
nine years later
announcer: Attention, all Milwaukee leprechauns.
Stan: Hey, all you Milwaukee leprechauns.
this is St. Patty's Day.
get your shamrock groove on at Stan Ross' Mr. 3000 Sports Bar,
Iocated on Peacock Street in Waukesha County.
we got 3, 000 different kind of beers.
we got Wild lrish Rose and anything that you might want.
but wait. There's more.
you want to get that heavy vibration from that special someone?
get your page on at 3000 Beeps.
get your hair dyed, fried, and laid to the side at 3000 Cuts.
knickknack patty-whack, get your dog a bone.
and get your woof on at 3000 Paws.
get your Szechuan feast on at 3000 Woks.
bring the whole family down to Mr. 3000 Shopping Center.
Stan: First year, I was 150 votes short.
come here.
second year, I was less than 50 and so on.
last year, I was just 4 votes away.
sportswriters hate me.
but my numbers don't lie.
I got 3, 000 up there, one for each one of my hits.
they gotta let me in.
it's my year, and everybody knows it.
what about him?
who's that?
you know who that is.
that's T-Rex Pennebaker.
best player on the Brewers.
T-Rex Pennebaker ain't nothin'.
I don't even know why you bother learning his name, especially what you got in front of you, a living legend.
a certified immortal.
and I know you don't know a lot of immortals.
[ laughs ] Hey, easy, old man.
old man?
what you mean is "aged," like U. S.D. A. beef.
it's what's for dinner.
not on my plate.
no? -No.
monstrous.
just ain't like the old days, huh, Boca?
Mnh-mnh.
Wow. -Spring training.
you can practically smell the grass, can't you?
can't say I can, man.
what, you don't miss it?
miss it?
Nah.
Nah.
Stan didn't make many friends when he was playing here.
he wasn't very good with the press.
we invited him to Old-timers' Day every year since he retired.
that's nine years.
and he never RSVP'd once.
he might not want to do this, you know what I'm saying?
no. What are you saying?
I'm just saying, "Stan Ross Day."
retire his number.
the fans, man.
did he go for it?
did you hit him with the fans bit?
how about where you say you didn't know if I would do it?
Boca, I swear, when you get to going, you can talk a stripe off a zebra.
monstrous.
man: And welcome to beautiful Miller Park.
ladies and gentlemen, we're here today to retire number 21, worn by one of the Brewers' all-time greats.
seven times an All-Star, a member of that exclusive 3, 000-base-hit club, the Wizard of Wood, the Count of Contact, and the King of the Swing,
Milwaukee's own Mr. 3000, Stan Ross!
Wow!
Damn!
I still look good.
he hasn't lost his touch, has he?
and joining us today to pay tribute to Stan,
Iet's welcome former teammate Bill "Big Horse" Berelli.
who?
I think he played with you a couple of months in '79.
he was a middle reliever.
what happened to Paul Molitor, man?
Robin Yount? Cecil Cooper? What happened to them?
they declined.
we're lucky we got him.
you know, a lot of people said that Stan only looked out for himself.
that he wasn't a team player.
but I'm here to tell you that if you get 3, 000 hits, you don't have to be a team player.
what?
if you have a lifetime 314 average, you don't have to be a good guy.
if you lead the league in batting for three years, you can be the biggest jerk in the world.
he laughin', man. He laughin'.
so on behalf of all of us who played alongside of you, congratulations.
go on, go on, man. You can't help me now.
also here with us today, you remember him well, number 8, Anthony Carter.
all right, come on. Tell them like it is, Boca.
come on, baby. Now we're talkin'.
me and Stan were teammates.
man, could he hit the ball.
tell 'em, baby.
and I loved him for that.
I love you more.
that's it? I'm trying to get enshrined.
that's it? Man, y'all killin' me, man.
all right, Milwaukee,
Iet's hear it for our Brewers' own Stan Ross!
thank you so much.
first, I want to thank you, Mr. Schembri, and the entire Milwaukee Brewers organization.
and to my main man, my best friend, Boca Carter.
and to you, Old Donkey.
big Horse! -Whatever!
but most of all, I want to thank you-all.
the fans.
you were always there for me.
and I know for a fact, if it was up to you,
I'd have been in the Hall of Fame a long time ago.
but unfortunately, it's up to a bunch of sportswriters.
some metalhead half-asses.
how the hell do you bat 3, 000
and not be selected into the Hall of Fame?
what type of bullshit is that? -[ Feedback ]
let me tell you something.
you-all believed in me when I was at my best.
you-all believed in me when I was at my worst.
you, the fans!
[ cheers and applause ]
that's why I know for a fact
I can depend on you-all to bring me, Stan Ross, to Cooperstown.
I can hear you say "Stan!
crowd: Stan!
say "Stan Ross"!
Stan Ross!
Stan Ross!
Stan Ross!
he's the boss!
he's the boss!
say "Hall of Fame"!
hall of Fame!
it's a damn shame!
over here, say, "Hell, yeah"!
hell, yeah!
say, "Hell, yeah"!
hell, yeah!
say, "You're the man"!
you're the man!
let me hear it again!
you're the man!
they love me. -You're the man!
you got a minute?
hang on. What?
you know how when we think somebody's gonna be voted in, we run the numbers.
every win, every home run, every hit?
Yeah.
we were running that for Stan Ross.
a list of every one of his 3, 000 hits.
there's an error. -One of the hits was an error?
no, all the hits were hits. There just aren't 3, 000 of them.
okay. Start over.
okay, there was a game in May 1982 that was called for curfew.
when they finished in August, the hits were recorded twice.
once in May, once in August.
Stan Ross had three hits in that game.
that means that three of the hits don't count.
so you're telling me... -Stan Ross, Mr. 3000, -has only 2, 997 hits. -2, 997 hits.
as Yahko tried to escape across the rope bridge, he realized that he was trapped by both sides by the dreaded, evil boars.
Yahko knew his only hope was to do the unthinkable, and that was to jump far, far below into the raging, raging river.
hold on, kids.
Hello?
hey...
Hey, man, the press is eating it up.
what happens to Yahko?
shh, shh, shh, shh.
what happened to Yahko? -What?
what happened to Yahko? -What happened to Yahko?
shut up!
boy: I can't believe you said that.
man, that's bullshit!
Oh, Mr. Ross. -CHlLDREN: Ooh!
please, the children. -Man, hell with the kids!
Yahko's dead!
Scott: The Hall of Fame vote is in, and Stan Ross is not.
the always-controversial ex-Brewer had slowly crept to within four votes of enshrinement, but this time finished 147 votes shy, following a correction in the record books that left him three hits short of the magical 3, 000.
Stan's gonna wait -Turn it off.
till next year to wait till next life.
from the green...
I can't let them do it to me.
I can't let them take away my legacy.
# Watch me! #
# Watch me! #
# I got it #
# Watch me! #
# I got it, hey! #
you love me because I'm one of the greatest hitters alive.
# I got somethin' that tells me #
you love me because I'm one of the greatest hitters alive.
# I got soul, and I'm super bad #
you love me because I'm one of the greatest hitters alive.
# I got soul #
# And I'm super bad #
# I got it, hey! #
I'm back!
the King with the Swing, the right arm they call "The Gun,
Stan Ross.
nitroglycerin himself.
number 21, the man with sweetest swing in the major league, is back.
[ slurring ] You gotta be joking.
how old are you?
47 and getting younger.
that's why I love you, man.
man, what the hell? What's your damn problem, man?
that was 4/10 of a second.
that's how much time you have after the ball leaves the pitcher's hand to decide whether it's a fastball, a split-finger.
wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
what you know about the game? You played in the majors?
figures. He's drunk.
no, I've just been a Brewers fan my whole life while you treated the team and the fans and the city like dirt.
yo, Boca, get this man another bottle.
thank you. -You're welcome.
I want you to try it again. -What?
cause last time I wasn't standing at the plate.
come on, try it again.
Yeah.
Boca. See that?
three more of these.
three more hits.
as I said before, Stan Ross is back.
better talk to him, Boca.
ladies and gentlemen, number 21, the great, the fantastic,
Mr. Incredible.
Stan.
man: I thought when we retired his number, we wouldn't have to see that prick anymore.
man #2: He's a senior citizen. Do you think I want him here?
and he hasn't played the game in nine years.
it's not like we're in the American League anymore, so he's gotta play the field.
can he even handle first base at his age, let alone hit?
fellas.
we are in fifth place, and we are not drawing flies.
and we've got two very long months ahead of us.
the biggest crowd we've had all year was the day we retired Stan's number.
now, we give him a physical.
give him a month to get in shape.
then after that September roster expansion, if he's up to it, we put him in the lineup.
Bo, all I need is a bat.
that's it, baby.
look at him.
he ain't got no waist on him. He got nothin'.
Stan Ross. -Hey.
Eddie Richling. I'm the conditioning coach.
he here to carry you home?
the only thing Boca gonna carry is my plaque.
that's why I love you. -I love you more.
is that right? How many push-ups can you do?
one arm or two?
well, I'll tell you what, last time I counted, what was it, about 40, 50?
I got 5 bucks in my pocket says you can't give me 10.
that's easy money. Back up, man.
you better help your boy down. -He didn't help me in.
come on, let's see what you got.
okay, well, that's one.
how many is that?
Oh, I don't know. I'd say 40, 50.
that's four.
come on, Stan. You got this one.
Oh, oh! Your knee touched, man.
that's a girl push-up. -You see my knee touch?
well, it might have, yeah.
but who said girl push-ups don't count?
Yeah, who said girl push-ups don't count?
how you want to pay me, cash or check?
Oh, look at them arms starting to shake.
come on.
come on.
Aah! Oof!
okay, Stan, now you ready to get started for real?
man, what type of shit is this?
hydrostatic weighing.
it's how we determine how much body fat you really have.
I don't need my balls washed to tell you how much I weigh.
hold your breath, Stan.
this ain't nothin' but a Southern baptism.
it's called modern technology, Stan.
recently, the Brewers have incorporated new methods of training into their exercise regimen.
we're gonna get you started on this bad boy.
look at this. -Mm-hmm.
this looks like some punishment.
actually, it's very gentle.
it's called Pilates.
Pi-what?
breathe in.
okay, feel the extensors now.
I feel like Flipper.
B, that's what I'm talkin' about.
I'm gonna start off real light, about 463.
you can throw 463 on if you want to, chicken chest, but your equipment is right over there.
remember what I told you. Keep that ass up.
all right, push!
whoa, where you going?
is this a joke?
it's only a joke if you think weak abs are funny.
feel it in your lats?
you ask me about my lats. Yeah, I feel it.
my spine and my butt, too.
push it! Push it! Push it!
come on! -Aah!
# It's fun to stay at the Y. M. C. A. #
# It's fun to stay at the Y. M. C. A. #
# They have everything for young men to enjoy #
# You can hang out with all the boys #
whoa, where you going? Get back here.
# It's fun to stay at the Y. M. C. A. #
Whoo! Yeah!
# You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal #
# You can do whatever you feel #
stand up.
sit down.
come on, now up.
look at this boy go. Look at your boy.
what's your name? -Stan Ross.
tell 'em your name. -Stan Ross.
who are you? -Stan Ross!
Louder! -They call me the boss.
who? -'Cause I pay the cost.
Why? -'Cause I'm Stan Ross!
# You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal #
# You can do whatever... #
so, tomorrow, man, you ready?
game's changed a lot since we last played.
I still see the ball. I still hit the ball.
all day.
but I do miss playin'.
I know I always said I didn't, but I do.
ain't nothin' like hittin' in the major leagues.
bein' a part of that great tradition.
I never felt that type of respect that I felt on the ball field.
that kind of attention.
Oh, shoot, that reminds me.
you got a call this afternoon.
some ad-agency guy from New York.
endorsement?
was it Reebok?
it's not Reebok.
adidas or Nike?
Viagra.
what?
Viagra, man. You'd be the spokesman.
I ain't gonna be no damn spokesman for no Viagra.
I can still swing my bat, Bo.
SCHEMBRl: Are we ready to roll here?
okay, the Milwaukee Brewers are pleased to be able to help a member of the Brewer family reclaim his rightful place in baseball history.
so it is with great pride that I introduce to you the once and future Mr. 3000, Stan Ross.
thank you.
thank you, Mr. Schembri, and the Milwaukee Brewers organization.
and I promise, it won't be like last time when I'm in front of the microphone with all that cussin' and shit, you know?
Hey, Stan. -Yes?
is this only about getting back to 3, 000 hits, or do you believe you can help make the Brewers more competitive on the field?
how could I not make them more competitive?
let me be a little polite here.
the Milwaukee Brewers are weak.
man: Here we go. -Who they got?
they're a Little League team. You all know it. They need me.
how do you think you'll adjust to the contemporary game?
you ever heard of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes?
earth, Wind & Fire?
some things just always play well.
a little "old school" is what this team needs.
you nervous? -What if you don't hit?
what's that?
I said, "What if you don't hit"?
if all this talk is just talk and it becomes obvious you're hurting the team, will you take yourself out of the lineup?
I said I'm gonna hit.
when I say I'm gonna do something, I do it.
that's not always how it works.
well, it is for me.
not the way I remember.
maybe you remember something you thought I said I was gonna do, but didn't say I was gonna do it, 'cause I cold-blood do everything I say I'm gonna do.
[ laughs ] Is that the way you were raised?
straight up and down, like 6: 00.
so what does your mama think about this comeback foolishness?
why are we getting on this Mama stuff?
okay, that's it for today, folks.
thank you very much.
man: Just get one more question.
get in line.
you really nailed him on that one.
Maureen.
Hey.
what you doing here?
what do you think? I'm covering the story for ESPN.
Uh-huh. Why you, though?
[ scoffs ] They sent me.
just by chance, you ain't here to see me?
no, I'm on assignment.
they asked me to cover a story, so I'm covering it, period.
I'll see you at the ball park.
Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo. Wait, wait.
how about an exclusive?
see?
you and me?
huh? [ Laughing ]
you think you'll get three hits in your first three at-bats and get this thing over with?
come on, Mo, I'm 47 years old.
it'll probably take me maybe four at-bats.
you're one of a kind, Stan Ross. Thank you for sitting with us.
good luck tonight.
thank you.
that's it. Thanks, guys. That's a wrap.
that wasn't too bad, was it? -That was great.
after I get my hits today, you want to come by and celebrate?
you know, you better keep your mind on the game, Mr. 3000.
you thinkin', eh?
well, we'll see in a few hours, won't we?
Stan, you da man.
livin' legend, baby.
Yes, sir, all you got to do is walk up in there and take those youngsters to school.
Hey, oh, good. Buddy, come here.
help me out, please, with the zipper.
Hey, can you give me a hand? -You best mean a handshake.
wait a minute. You're Stan Ross.
Stan! Stan! Huge fan. You gotta help me out.
you gotta unzip me.
I'm gonna tell my buddies. "Stan Ross unzipped my pants.
you crazy.
Oh, crazy? Thinkin' I'm crazy?
where is he? Stan, Stan, Stan, Stan.
let me tell you something. I am crazy!
crazy for asking you to give me a hand!
woman: Yeah, good luck on tonight's game.
now, this shit is all right.
Uh-huh, sound effects could be a little bit louder when a brother hit.
that shit should sound like a cannon!
Mr. Ross.
I'm Rick, the clubhouse assistant.
just Stan. I'm just Stan.
all right. That's your locker over there.
man ON TELEVlSlON: The Arizona Diamondbacks and the Milwaukee Brewers.
go ahead, man, it's in my locker.
I'm Stan Ross. -I know very well who you are.
I grew up watching your excellent play on television.
you are hero to many young Japanese players.
but you have hole in your ass.
hole in my ass?
what's his problem? -That's Fukuda.
he was taught English in school in Japan, but they never taught him to cuss worth a damn.
but why he cuss me out? I never did nothin' to him.
brother, you're looking at 25 Little Leaguers in here who want to give you an ass-whupping.
Oh, 6-3! 6-3, man!
you're right, 6-4. I was trying to cheat.
Minadeo, Skillett. Second and short.
they'll go at it over anything.
what are you talking about? No! That's half out.
lt all got to be in. -lt half went in.
it has to go in, all of it.
you're always trying to pull this.
what do you say, Grandpa? Does that count?
grandpa?
man: Here it is. -Uh-oh. Lineup!
base hit, dinner's on me.
Ah, yes! Now batting leadoff.
skills that pay the bills. [ Laughs ]
Whoo!
was Panas here yet back when you were playing?
Yeah, he was here.
I don't think I was one of his favorites.
Stan Ross, you bat eighth! Ha ha!
eighth? That's for banjo hitters.
man, I never batted lower than fifth in my life.
you bat that now, you son of my dick.
son of my dick?
Hey, what size you swinging over there, Old School?
34 ounce, like I always have.
you sure you can still get around with that at your age?
don't you worry about me.
I've been swinging this thing sweet before you knew which side of the bat was the good end.
Whoo!
Yeah, I swing a 36 myself.
Yeah, that's big talk.
I got a hammer my damn self.
Whew.
come on, Coach.
man: Ross, you suck!
how's it feel, Stan?
how about an interview after the game?
come on, now, don't distract me when I'm hittin'.
hitting's my business.
that's what I'm talkin' about. -Lookin' good, Stan.
man: Stan! Still the Wizard of Wood!
bingo.
Oh, yeah.
I'm about to take care of business.
crowd: Charge!
charge!
charge!
announcer: Bottom of the third, and the cheers you hear, and the boos, for that matter, are for Stan Ross.
it's the reason most of the 38, 000-plus fans are here tonight.
man ON P. A. First baseman, number 21, Stan Ross.
this guy throws pretty hard, Pops.
is that right?
well, I hit pretty hard, son.
strike one.
come on, Stan.
be aggressive.
I am.
stay focused. Keep your eye on the ball.
I'm looking dead at it.
I don't need you to tell me what to do.
come on in.
I've been here before.
this ain't my first picnic, baby.
Ooh, Stan was a hair off timing that big breaking ball from Hamilton.
of course, all season, a lot of hitters, who aren't 47 years old, have been fooled by Hamilton.
and we're the Little Leaguers?
not so aggressive, baby.
Whew. Focus.
he playin' to you.
let him play to you, baby. Come on.
come on, Stan.
come on, baby.
strike!
announcer: lnside fastball, and Stan Ross is out of there on three straight pitches.
it looks like it could be a long night for the King of Swing.
what up? Welcome to "SportsCenter.
Stuart Scott with you. We got some more baseball.
braves at Brewers. [ Chuckles ]
who cares?
well, Stan Ross cares.
the first week at bat was a lot like the first week out of the womb for Stan.
a lot of drooling and a lot of just flailing around for the erstwhile King of Swing.
let's check out the highlights.
well, Stan the man more like Stan the statue, just chillin' at a curve for strike one.
next pitch. Now, wait a second.
what was it that Stan said about the rest of his team?
the Milwaukee Brewers are weak.
who they got?
they're a Little League team.
they need me.
Uh-huh. Little Leaguers, huh?
well, my 9-year-old has a better swing and better eyes than that.
Oh! Just chillin' at a called strike three, and, well, that'll get you some halitosis action.
Yeah, when you get just a little too close to the umpire.
Stan's not done. He decided to do a little spring cleaning.
either that, or he just wants to symbolize how well he's been playing.
Yeah, garbage!
now, I'm not gonna say that every Brewer but Stan had a hit, but I am gonna say that every Brewer but Stan that played had a hit.
our Maureen Simmons was at the game and had postgame duty.
not the day Stan Ross or the Milwaukee fans had in mind.
word around the organization is that manager Gus Panas is particularly unhappy having Ross back in the lineup.
apparently he hasn't forgotten the way Stan abandoned the team in the middle of the pennant race nine years ago.
Stuart.
the press is having a field day.
Hey, they're just getting even with Stan for all those years of abuse.
for turning this team into a laughingstock.
five games and hasn't gotten close to a hit.
how long do we let this go on?
we got 35, 000 people in the park today.
we're committed to this.
whether Stan Ross ever gets another hit or not.
you sure you don't want anything stronger than club soda?
Oh, no, I'm good.
Thanks, Boca.
why you call him Boca?
look at him.
he look like he's ready for Boca Raton with them tracksuits.
Stan don't appreciate my velour.
that's all he wears.
Mo, I swear, he has a black one for funerals.
just comin' from me, I think my man take his old Reebok endorsement deal a little too serious.
Hey, a lifetime supply. -That's why I love you.
no, that's why I love you. -No, I love you more.
no, I love you more.
no, no, I started the love.
and your life's been richer ever since.
I hear you.
nice to see you again, Mo.
mm, you too, Tony.
so, you hire a fancy decorator to help you do this place?
girl, you need to quit fightin'.
you know doggone well you thought I was gonna be old and tired when I quit the game.
I never thought about it. -You thought it.
but I got news for you.
I own this place, and I own all the stores next door.
3000 Suds, 3000 Woks, and 3000 Beeps.
that's why you're comin' back. So all them names make sense.
sister, you know why I'm comin' back.
cause I deserve to be in the Hall of Fame with the immortals.
you know, you really shouldn't word it like that.
ls that right? -Mm-hmm.
what? -Oh, you know what.
you better hush.
you eatin' that steak. Let me see something.
come here. Flex. -Mnh-mnh.
Mo, Mo, baby, look at you. Come on, Mo.
look at you, Mo.
oho!
and quick still.
you gonna eat this?
you sure got time to eat.
baby, you hungrier than a hostage.
Ooh, take a bite out of crime.
that killed me there, I'll tell ya.
I thought the lady must have...
wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait.
you don't train no more. You don't drink no more.
what's up with that?
cause I remember you used to drink half the American League underneath the table.
I realized I had to start cuttin' loose from those things that weren't getting me anywhere.
where you need to be gettin'? -On with my life.
we don't stay young forever.
come on. You know we're young enough.
Ooh, I don't think so, Mr. Ross.
come on, I know you remember what it was like.
you can't say we didn't have something special.
good night.
what about Kansas City? That was a mind-blowing weekend.
you mean to tell me you forgot about that?
Bye-bye.
Cleveland, when I had your toenails poppin' off like Redenbacher.
Bye. -Come on, how about Toronto?
God.
Uh-huh. -Oh.
come on, say it. -Come on, now.
you know I didn't expect you in Toronto.
you know how those Canadian groupies are.
come on, now. -You know what?
don't give me that crap.
you're a selfish man. You always were.
okay, if you so upset, why was you willing to get back with me?
we got together for a night, but I didn't stay for breakfast, did l?
we'd still be doin' it if you didn't take that ESPN gig.
when there's a better offer on the table, you gotta take it.
I'll pay for it.
Bye-bye. -[ Tires screech ]
announcer: The count is 1-1 on the second baseman Minadeo.
brewers down by 4.
runner at first.
they sure could use a little spark here.
glickman now on the mound, working from the stretch.
throws to first and picked him off.
Skillett is caught napping.
when is this ball club going to wake up?
another mistake.
Minadeo steps back in.
here's the wind and the pitch.
swung on, a one-hopper back to the mound.
he bobbles it, but what's Minadeo doing?
he's not running. Now they pick it up.
the throw to first, and he's out.
Aah! -Come on!
Stan: Look at that.
there should be a man on first and second right now.
but easy, Gus. Don't get excited.
I don't want you to pop no blood vessel.
what you-all havin', prayer?
announcer: The only shining star on the team these days is their strapping young outfielder, T-Rex Pennebaker.
but even his impressive power numbers have done little to stop the Brewers' losing streak.
Pennebaker digs in.
and here's the windup and the pitch.
swung on and a deep, deep drive to left field.
it's going, going.
it is gone!
4-1.
yet another bases-empty home run for T-Rex Pennebaker.
what the hell is that?
that right there?
that's a little somethin' for "SportsCenter."
Plus, that's gonna look tight in next year's video game.
what the hell you call yourself doin'?
yo, I'm puttin' the show in the show.
but your team losin'.
instead of playin', you makin' like Mr. Bojangles.
I just hit a home run, son.
maybe you was takin' a grandpa nap during that part.
but your team gettin' picked off.
your boys ain't beatin' out grounders.
there should've been two men on when you hit that homer.
it should be a ball game right now.
so yell at them, Old School.
get up out of my face. I did my job.
you the superstar.
you set the tone.
listen here.
when you get a base hit in this millennium, then you can come on down there and talk to me.
is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, Stan, you think that diaper's affecting your swing?
maybe you should use something lighter.
how about a Wiffle bat? [ Laughs ]
how 'bout I shove my Hall of Fame bat up the crack of your mascot ass?
make you a hot dog on a stick, bitch.
yeah? I might be a sausage with teeth, but you sure as hell ain't no Hall of Famer.
# If you disrespect # -What?
# Everybody that you run into #
Stan: Looks familiar?
familiar?
you ain't changed nothin' since back in the day.
in fact, I don't think you even vacuumed.
well, why mess with perfection?
Oh, I can think of a lot of descriptions for this couch, and "perfection" ain't one of 'em.
what's the deal there?
how come I hardly see you on "SportsCenter" anymore?
you know.
they got some pretty young thing they tryin' to groom.
that's bull. They can't treat you like that.
I remember once upon a time I pushed out the 40-year-old.
I been playin' this game long enough to know how it goes.
but I've been lookin' ahead toward it, you know?
I'm gonna start producing next year.
I'm goin' behind the camera. -Oh, you go, girl.
like I've been telling you, you can't beat Father Time.
well, how come you really haven't settled down?
the right man wasn't right.
[ Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" plays ]
# I've been really trying, baby #
what's the matter with you?
that's my song.
# Trying to hold back this feeling for so long #
come on, bump with me. Don't leave me hangin'.
come on. I need you, now.
don't leave me hangin'. Come on.
come on. Come on out here.
all right, only 'cause I like this song, too.
not 'cause I like you. -I'll take it.
# Whoo, let's get it on # -Come on.
# Oh, baby #
# Let's get it on #
Hey. - # Let's love, baby #
# Let's get it on # -[ Chuckles ]
still got it, girl.
# Sugar #
# Let's get it on # -Still got it.
Stan. -Yeah, baby?
honey, stop chasing the butt.
you know what, Mo?
the best sex I ever had was with you.
what? -Yeah.
you had girls in every city in baseball.
it wasn't the best.
why is that? We do it longer?
not really.
more positions, then?
I ain't goin' there.
Mm-hmm.
more times a night?
Oh, you still hold the record.
I don't know, baby. I guess I like the rest of it.
the rest of it? What's left?
well, you know.
I like the sleepin' and the talkin'
and hangin' out and stuff like that.
# Giving yourself to me #
# Can never be wrong # -But that's not sex.
it is to me.
no, it's not sex.
what you call that, then?
# Ooh-ooh #
# Now, don't you know #
# How sweet and wonderful life can be? #
# Ooh-ooh #
# I'm asking you #
before we go too far, I can't spend the night.
why not? -Early flight.
where you got to go?
I got three games before we go on the road.
but I got to get back. -You got to get...
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
are you givin' up on me, Mo?
what you got to say? -I don't have a say.
I just go where I'm assigned.
you tell 'em I'm startin' to swing the bat good again?
I'm just a reporter.
I don't make the news or decide what is the news.
you're givin' up on me, too. -Mnh-mnh.
you just got to make the news, baby.
start hittin' that ball. -Come on.
what? -Come on.
you want to go up? Stay down? What?
no.
I'm not in the mood right now.
you...
you're kiddin'. You're not in the mood?
no. -Oh, come on, baby.
no, I got a headache.
Really? You gonna tell me you got cramps, too?
maybe.
you know...
whatever.
all right, now. I'm leavin'.
Lord, just when I thought I'd seen it all.
t-rex: When you get a base hit in this millennium, then you can come on down...
Stan: I can still swing my bat.
MO: You think you'll get three hits in your first three at-bats?
Scott: More like Stan the statue.
t-rex: When you get a base hit...
MO: You just got to make the news, baby.
start hittin' that ball.
man: One, two, three strikes, you're out!
Oh, bat boy.
Ooh, ooh, a little testy. A little testy.
anybody have a Stan Ross rookie card?
quite valuable.
if you look on the back, you'll see it's written in Latin.
you see, very old.
very old card. It's on parchment.
[ channel changes ] -He's now 0-27 in his comeback.
at what point, Peter, does the rust come off?
I'm not sure it does.
remember, Jim Palmer tried to come back after he was in the Hall of Fame, and he kept himself in better shape than Ross.
why does the media hate this guy so much?
he's a jerk.
because T-Rex is the best in power and performance.
find it at Radio Shack.
radio Shack. You've got questions.
we've got answers.
cause I want my hits that got stolen from me.
those hits are my ticket to the Hall of Fame.
he's not going to the Hall of Fame!
you think three hits are keeping you out?
3, 000 hits, baby, it's automatic.
look at me.
you're 47 years old. You're fat. You're out of shape.
favorite portion of the show, the comedy portion.
I'm gonna say it here, the woman that puts on the sausage outfit that races around Miller Park has got a better chance of getting a hit than Stan Ross.
[ audience jeering ] -That's not fair, Tom.
he's a black athlete.
black athletes age slower.
george Foreman didn't know when to get out.
Mike Tyson didn't know when to get out.
michael Jordan struggled, and he was only out two years.
this guy hasn't played since I was married to my first wife.
it just isn't possible to get out of his day.
he's a bad teammate.
Stan Ross was a great athlete. -Stan is all about Stan.
the Brewers knew what they were getting into.
it's a publicity stunt, just like when the White Sox hired that midget.
Tom, you can't say "midget.
he's small. That guy was small for a friggin' midget.
it's like if the Red Sox thawed out Ted Williams, although he'd hit better than Stan.
listen, Stan's playing like he's frozen.
Stan is embarrassing. He's embarrassing me.
he's embarrassing him. He should give it up.
but when an athlete gets to that point, he loses all his pride.
Yeah, you're making me cry. I don't think he's embarrassed.
I think he's having a party at his place, got bitches all around and counting all his money.
I don't think Stan cares.
man: Wrong! He's embarrassed.
he used to be able to hit, cannot hit now.
SALLEY: Very embarrassing, especially with all the bitches he got around.
Hey, Boca.
you think I should quit?
do your thing, man.
you think?
I'm just saying.
Yeah, you're right.
I got three home games against the Astros before we go on the road.
I'm gonna play those games, and that's it.
if I don't get a hit, it's over.
I'm not goin' on the road.
what you think, Boca?
do your thing, man.
you think?
I'm just saying.
Yeah.
you're right.
you want to get married?
you the only one that love me. I'm serious.
I've been waitin' 20 years for you to ask me that.

you see that?
I was all over that nickel curve ball.
t-rex: Looked like a groundout to me.
say what, partner?
I said, "lt looked like a groundout to me.
you don't see it.
he tipped his pitch, and I called it.
Koron, how long has this pitcher been in the league?
two years. -Two years, man!
he's showin' his pitch, and he don't know it.
watch his right arm.
his elbow go in like this. He grip the ball.

and another run scores.

Hey!
you okay?
I don't want Panas to take me out.
I had a few bad outings in a row, and if I don't get my face out my ass and get out this inning,
I know the team is going to give me the shoe.
give you the shoe?
Yeah, the shoe.
look, don't be thinkin' negative out here, okay?
just keep the ball low and away. We'll get you out the inning.
then I'm gonna work on your cussin'.
come on.
let's go, baby. Let's go.

I don't know why I bothered comin' back.
you can't play. You definitely can't ump.

Aah, what'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you, baby?
yo, what are you jawin' about now, Old School?
he tipped his pitch. You saw it.
are you still talking about that weak-ass ground ball?
Yeah, I'm talking about it.
all right, let me tell you something, man.
all right? I hit 43 home runs.
43 home runs before you ever even got here, man.
so I don't need none of that.
so save it!
T-Rex. -T-Rex.
it's the 31st time you've homered but your team's lost.
does that get to you?
my team lost, huh?
you know what, man?
this ain't my team.
if this was my team, these fools would be hittin' home runs like I'm hittin'.
and they'd be stealin' bases like I'm out there stealin'.
I'm the only one out there gettin' mine.
what the rest of these fools doin'?
they ain't doin' crap! Talk about a team!
we go out there every day, but there ain't no nine guys.
this is me up in here. There's eight other cats...
Stan: Whoa!
boy, that pup sound just like me back in the day, I swear.
boy, I'm tellin' you.
but you didn't catch the real story on tonight's game.
no, come here. Let me ask you a question.
man: Move it over there.
when was the last time you saw a 47-year-old man end an inning with the hidden-ball trick, huh?
is that the first time you pulled that off in a game?
are the Brewers goin' to the World Series?
it was 1989, against the Mariners.
yo, T-Rex.
hold up.
you know why I stepped in tonight with them reporters?
Yeah.
you can't stand to see another brother gettin' some attention.
boy, that's what you think? -Yeah, man, that's what I think.
let me tell you something.
you keep talking about your teammates the way you do, boastin' about yourself, you're gonna end up all by yourself.
all alone and empty, like you are right now.
you know what's gonna happen?
they're gonna retire your number someday, and Big Horse Berelli gonna be standin' up there with you.
[ scoffs ] Yeah? Who the hell is Big Horse Berelli?
that's my point exactly.
nice car.
announcer: He's picking up his stride, blowing away the competition.
looks like the bratwurst is getting smoked.
no pun intended, kids.
looks like number 3, the ltalian sausage, has won the race.
now batting, first baseman, number 21, Stan Ross.

Hey, Stan Ross.
I got one question for you, man.
yo, man, what the hell was you thinkin'?
y'all saw Old Man River swimmin' all up in the dirt for a hit today!
yo, but listen, man.
how many games we got left in this season?
KORON: 1 1.
11 games left, y'all.
and how many games out of third place are we?
7
7 games.
we're only 7 games out, y'all.

Yeah! -Yeah!
so let's get it together, and let's do this like it's October!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hey! Let's get a "Brewers" on three!

Ohh, but listen.
I'm on third base, right?
Nolan Ryan looking at me like he want to kill me, right?
Boca's getting ready to bunt. The manager didn't call it.
but I know Boca's a ballplayer.
he's the real deal. Plus, I know what he thinkin'.
Yeah, he was thinkin' that I was thinkin' what he was thinkin'.
well, I'm ready to sprint towards home.
as I'm tearin' down the line,
Boca decided he wanted to swing away.
I wasn't thinkin'.
man, wasn't thinkin'!
I mean, hit a screamin' liner right past my head.
all I heard...
Oh, hold on, fellas.
hold on.
Uh-oh.
so, you're the story again.
still mad at me?
hmm?
Nah.
I'm hittin' now.
# I've been really trying, baby #
# Trying to hold back this feeling #
# For so long # -Mmmm.
# And if you feel like I feel, baby #
# Come on #
# Oh, come on #

# Let's get it on # -Well...
Hey, where you goin'?
[ sighs ] I gotta go.
you gotta go where?
I just gotta go.
what's up?
look, Stan, it was just sex, right?
I mean, best sex I ever had, too, but that's all it was.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
what about the sleepin', talkin', and hangin' out part?
what about that? -That's your idea of sex.
hold on. A man could be wrong.
you said it wasn't sex. I'm just trying to go with that.
it was really nice, Stan.
wait. Let me talk to you for a minute.
Oh, oh, hold on now. -What?
wait, look.
look.
what?
I was thinkin' about that producer.
the behind-the-camera stuff you was talkin' about.
and I'm just wonderin'.
ain't that something you can do here in Milwaukee?
Stan.
[ laughing ] Stan.
Stan, you're being very sweet.
but we both know that you ain't never been serious enough to go bringin' up something like that.
so I'll see you at the ball park.

yo, yo!
come on, with that noise. I'm tryin' to watch a game.
what are you talkin' about, papi?
this song is baseball.
that ain't no real baseball song.
you want to hear a real baseball song?
# Da-da-da da-da da-da # -What the hell is that?
what? Man, let me tell you something.
when I was a kid on South Side Chicago, we used to play baseball when we got out of school till it got dark, when you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.
I used to play center field, and every single day, man, Mister Softee ice-cream truck used to park right behind me and play that damn song.
told you! - # Da-da-da da-da #
yo! Hey, yo!
yo! Yo! Yo!
fellas, come on, now. We got a game goin' on out here.
come on, we got a shot at third place.
you're right.
besides, dog, that was wack!
Fairmount Park, Philly, son.
we had that Good Humor truck.
and this is what baseball music sounds like.
Boo! -Boo!
that's why you're not playin' today, 'cause of that song.
you're wrong for that. Don't make no errors.
it was wrong the way I quit on the team back then.
I was young, Skip.
I was young.

announcer: Game tied at 4.
just one out and the winning run at third base.
the Astro infield moving in.
and here comes Stan Ross.
he could win the game here with a long fly ball, but you can bet that's not what he's thinking.
infield tight, hitter's delight.
a great chance to get hit number 2, 999.
t-rex: Come on, y'all. Here we go, Stan.
be a hitter, baby. Be a hitter.
come on, just drive the man in. A good fly ball, okay?
and here comes the pitch.
he swings, and it's a high fly ball to right.
it's carrying well.
it's to the warning track.
to the wall!
it is gone!
a home run!
Whoo!
Stan Ross touches them all.
I don't believe it.
Aah!
# Whoa, I feel good #
# I knew that I would, now # -Aaaah!
# Ow! #
# Feel good #
huh? Who's the old man, baby?
who's the old man, baby? -21!
who's the old man, baby? Huh?
I got your "old man," baby.
I got your "old man.
I got your "old man.
way to go, Stan.
I gave 'em they money worth tonight.
outstanding. You feel good?
I feel great. -You look great.
you looked like a champion out there.
let me paint you a picture. -Go ahead.
Miller Park, standing room only.
got that? -I got it.
43, 000 screaming fans, and they're there for one reason and one reason only.
to watch the legendary Stan Ross step to the plate and dig in.
shoot, that ain't no picture. That's a damn Rembrandt.
I agree, and that's why I'm telling Gus not to play you on the road.
hold on, man. Chill out, baby.
what are you talking about? Man, we're on a roll.
we're going for third place.
you're one hit away from making history, Stan.
don't you think you owe it to the fans to do it here at home?
hmm?
I don't know. You're takin' half my at-bats away.
although I hit a home run, I'm still 2 for 51.
2 for 58!
# Stan Ross is at the plate, the fans, they sit and wait #
look, what I'm sayin' is, don't cut me out.
the team need me. Come on, now.
Stan, you heard the sausage. You're 2 for 58.
the team doesn't need you to get third place.
they're on fire! Come on, let's face it.
but you, my friend, you have got to start thinking about life after baseball.
I'm talking endorsements, product lines.
a Stan Ross candy bar.
I want you doing press all week long on the road, Stan.
you pull this off, nothing's gonna keep you out of the Hall of Fame.
you're a champion.
Hey, Stan, Tom Arnold here. Congratulations on everything.
the team's on a tear. You won seven in a row.
you guys could finish third.
are you really talking to us from the clubhouse?
well, they're not gonna play me until I come home, so I might as well do something else with my time.
Stan, how does it feel not to be playing right now?
it don't feel good, especially the way I've been swinging, but that's Skip's decision.
I have to go with it because, as you say, we got a chance to make third place.
and they were in fifth place when you got there.
I finally got them playin' patented Stan Ross baseball.
okay, Stan.
Stan Ross, at 47, the oldest man to homer in the major leagues.
how's it feel?
to tell you the truth, we never thought you could do it, and some of us hoped you wouldn't, so we owe you an apology big-time.
well, it takes a big man to admit when he wrong, but like my teammate Kenji Fukuda taught me to say...
[ speaking Japanese ]
what the hell is he talking about?
Stan. -What does the future hold?
Yeah, Stan. -What about number 3, 000?
what game are you gonna get this hit in?
I think I'm gonna get it on the next at-bat.
you got another homer left in you?
keep your popcorn by your side 'cause it's comin'.
Stan Ross. -ls it gonna be a home run?
the faster you throw it in, the quicker it's goin' out.
[ laughs ] -Hey, Stan.
I hope you weren't listening to the trash we were talking about you before you hit your groove.
Tom, you wouldn't be where you are if it wasn't for Roseanne.
you know what?
that would have hurt if it wasn't true.
Stan Ross.
Stan Ross.
Stan Ross.
Hey, girl, you been watchin'?
the whole world loves me again, baby.
Stan Ross, the King of Swing.
sweetheart, I'm goin' national.
you know, you're starting to sound like the old Stan.
no, you're gettin' the best of both worlds.
the old and the new Stan Ross.
team player, baby.
so after you go national with all this press, what's left for me?
I'm gonna tell you what's left for you.
I'm gonna give you a special exclusive.
you meet me at the ball park Thursday morning at 9: 00.
just you, me, and the team.
I called a practice on my day off on our last home stand.
wait a minute.
Stan Ross called for an extra practice?
now, I never thought I'd live to see this day.
I guess you are getting a little serious, huh?
maybe I'm gettin' serious about you.
I'll see you at practice.
baby, you owe it to yourself.
Bye.
Oh, boy.
what you gonna do?
Whoo!
Hey, hey! -How you doin', dog?
Hey, Stan, go get your hit this Saturday, man.
I got tickets for that one.
no, I got tickets for tomorrow!
you save the stubs, boys and girls, because I'm going deep every game, and they all gonna be collector's items.
you all watch and see.
come here. I got a new idea. Listen.
I got a new PlayStation game, "Hall of Fame Baseball,"
where I get a chance to hit against those pitchers that were dead before I was born,
Iike Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson, and that candy-ass Cy Young.
[ laughs ] -Well, you draw up the plans.
you got a call an hour ago from "The Tonight Show.
they want you on there tomorrow.
I'm on a roll, man. I'm tellin' you.
that's big-time exposure. -Here's the hook.
they want you at the studio at 9: 00.
that's cool.
but you got that extra practice.
that's one practice. One practice.
I'm talking about Jay Leno. That's bigger than the game.
LENO: Stan Ross, come on out here!
what's up?
what's up, baby?
all on, baby.
have a seat.
all right.
team Brewer is on a roll, making a push for third place.
ha ha, baby, I'm on a roll, too, Jay.
I'm on a roll, too.
I'm sure to stay on that roll, what, are you taking the Ensure every day?
[ audience jeers ] -ls it once a day?
and then you have a sensible meal for dinner.
I can do anything a 20-year-old can do.
any doggone thing, baby.
anything, huh? -Show you right.
show you right. And I can do it all night.
Dave?
Yeah, there's a large black man hitting on your wife.
Yeah, show you right. -What's next?
I started my own little stuff right here.
check this out. Look at that.
my own little candy. -"Ross Bar."
get a shot of that one.
that is the most ratty-ass candy bar I've ever seen.
it's a piece of loose-leaf paper you wrote "Ross Bar" on.
it's a prototype. -Oh, the prototype.
you gotta start somewhere.
you know, I'm an entrepreneur. -[ Laughter ]
once you get over the initial modesty, I think you'll be fine.
you talkin' to the ladies' pet the men regret.
[ cheers ] -I'm Stan Ross.
what's my name, baby?
AUDlENCE: Stan Ross!
they call me what? -The boss!
because l... -Pay the cost!
because I'm... -Stan Ross!
turn it up, baby!
Stan Ross. Be right back right after this.
don't go away.
Yes, sir.
Boca! Yo, Bo!
did you see me, baby? Ha ha.
Jay and I did our thing. That ain't no ESPN.
I'm talkin' big-time.
Hey. Hey, baby.
don't you "baby" me.
I went to the park this morning, and you weren't there.
your entire team was there, and you're a no-show.
well, I mean...
Well?" Didn't you call for the practice?
besides letting down your teammates, you told me I could interview you.
well, interview me now. Come on, turn the camera on.
it's not like I'm hiding from you.
I'll come right around. That ain't nothin'.
shoot.
come on, baby.
all right, forget this. I'll freestyle it.
mark, Steve, are you ready? -You didn't ask if I'm ready.
you always ready. -Let me get on that side.
you can see the balls. It looks better.
Hey, how you doin'? -All right.
good.
[ clears throat ] Come on, baby.
I'm here with Hall of Famer hopeful Stan Ross, who is now just one hit from reclaiming his cherished 3, 000 career hits.
but let's talk about the name "Mr. 3000.
fit just right, doesn't it?
why is there so much emphasis on the name?
why do you care so much about it?
because it identifies greatness.
when you think of Mr. 3000, you think of Mr. Stan Ross, one of the greatest hitters straight up and down.
who were you before Mr. 3000?
Mr. 3000.
I'm just kidding.
before that, I was a young black kid on the South Side of Chicago, Stanley Ross, playin' baseball.
what does Stanley Ross think of Mr. 3000?
he wants his autograph.
Really? -Really.
what about your teammates? -They don't need it.
they get the chance to see history in the making.
Oh, okay.
so what you're saying is, your teammates get to see your 3, 000th hit, but not potentially move into third place?
what I'm saying is, thousands of people bought tickets this weekend, not to see us play for third place, but to see me get my hit.
Really? -Damn right.
it's the same reason why everybody else here.
same reason why you here, unless you're here for something else.
Oh, okay.
you selfish son of a bitch!
you don't want that on-camera. -No, I'm fine.
because I'm not the one who's desperate to live his entire life in front of the camera.
tell them about Toronto and the history you left there.
that's so old. -Your damn ego is so old!
it hasn't changed, Stan.
[ voice breaking ] I mean, how am I supposed to think about moving here when you can't do what you say you're gonna do?
Mo, it's only one damn practice, baby.
you know it's bigger than one practice, Stan.
but you're right.
I am here to record your history in the making.
and it's the same as it ever was.
Mo.
BOCA: You gonna run after her?
no.
I'll catch her later.
I got ball games to play.
what?
Whew. -What?
no, I'm just saying, man, that's why I love you, man.
wait a minute. What do you mean?
[ scoffs ] I'm just saying that I could always count on you to do your thing, you know?
you're consistent. You're always driven.
and you're always for yourself.
you sayin' that's a good thing?
I'm just saying.
# Come on! #
announcer: Just two weeks ago, fans, the Milwaukee Brewers seemed willing to accept their perennial position in the division cellar.
is it more than a coincidence that their solid defense and clutch hitting started with Stan Ross' 2, 998th hit?
while Ross was just a spectator during their last road trip,
T-Rex Pennebaker has emerged as the team leader.
we've all witnessed the mounting frustration for Ross, who has gone hitless in the first two games against the Astros in this, his final home stand.
you can't help but wonder what's going through his mind as Ross' window of opportunity to join that elite 3, 000-hit club is about to close and close before a nationwide audience.
so, here we are. The stage is set.
a re-energized team plays for respectability, while Stan Ross knocks on the door of baseball greatness.
tonight, 35, 000 fans witness as history unfolds over nine innings of Brewers baseball.
last chance to go out there and get yours.
we have a lineup change tonight.
in hopes of squeezing out an extra at-bat for Ross, he's hitting cleanup right behind Rex Pennebaker.
man ON P. A. Now batting, first baseman, number 21,
Stan Ross!
announcer: This big crowd is charged tonight.
the right-hander Norton, one of the most competitive pitchers in the league, will do everything he can to avoid being a footnote in baseball history.
one game, one more hit, and he has that magical 3, 000.
ball.
they're on their feet, rooting for Ross to get ahold of one, as Norton gets his sign.
Ross puts a good swing on it.
it's deep to right field and carrying well.
damn.
yo, Ross! Why don't you take a seat?
you ain't gettin' that hit off me tonight!
deal with it!
this guy's slider sucks. -Come on, man.
I guess somebody should have showed up to that practice.
announcer: Home half of the fourth.
it's still a scoreless tie.
this crowd ripe with anticipation every time Ross steps to the plate.
Ross swings.
a sharp ground ball up the middle.
second baseman Gomez with a diving stop.
he scrambles. It's gonna be close.
he's out!
[ booing ] -Oh, my, what a close play!
from our angle, I thought he was safe.
crowd: You're wrong!
I'm surprised Stan Ross isn't protesting the call.
that man was safe! -That man was out.
what game are you watching?
I called the man out. I'm watching the same game you are!
we are playing for third place! -The man was out!
don't make me run you, Gus.
you got your head so far up your ass, you didn't see the play!
head up my ass? -That's right! Head up your ass!
that's what I said! -That's it! You're outta here!
you're outta here! Let me tell you something!
get off of my field!
you're the worst umpire in this whole league!
outta here!
you're such a jerk!
the man was safe!
the guy's out!
he was safe!
walk him off the field!
get him off my field! -You were safe!
you were safe!
you were beautiful. Come on, tiger.
he was safe!
announcer: So it boils down to the bottom of the ninth inning.
still scoreless here in the final game of the season.
"Mr. 2999" very likely will be making his last plate appearance of a storied big-league career.
but first the man who's become sort of Ross' protege of late,
T-Rex Pennebaker.
we've got an interesting situation here, fans.
if Pennebaker homers, that's the game, and Ross won't get another shot.
man: Go, T! Come on, baby!
come on, baby. Get on.
I'll bring you home. Come on, get on, baby.
just get on.
and that ball is crushed.
a line drive to deep left center.
it's going, going.
it is off the base of the wall.
Pennebaker rounds first, heading for second.
and he is safe with a ringing double.
Oh, man!
he almost took the bat right out of Stan Ross' hands.
but now Ross is up with not only a chance for his 3, 000th base hit and a call from Cooperstown, but an opportunity to drive in the winning run and end the Brewers' season on a high note.
man: 3, 000, baby!
all right.
come on.
ball. -[ Booing ]
pitch to him. -Let's go, man.
get your hit.
ball. -Pitch to me, damn it!
reach out there and get it, then.
reach out and get it.
announcer: Those first two deliveries, way outside.
Ross now crowding the plate.
2 balls, no strikes.
nothing close from Norton.
I'm right here!
announcer: Here we go. This is it.
3-0, the count.
this crowd roaring, begging Norton to challenge Ross with a decent pitch.
BOCA: I could always count on you to do your thing, you know?
you're consistent. You're always driven.
and you're always for yourself.
that's why I love you.
announcer: Look at this!
Ross lays a sacrifice bunt up the first-base line, and T-Rex isn't stopping at third.
here's a throw to first base, and Ross is out.
here comes the play.
the slide, the tag. He is safe! He is safe!
the Brewers win!
the Brewers win!
# We're movin' #
# Groovin' #
# Ain't no stopping us now #
# Groovin' #
crowd: [ Chanting ] Stan! Stan! Stan! Stan!
Stan: Corny enough for you?
well, it gets worse.
first off, now all of a sudden, the press loves me.
took 'em long enough, though, huh?
the Hall of Fame voted me in on the very next ballot.
and as you can imagine, I had plenty of people to thank.
and old Mo.
she decided to move back to Milwaukee after all.
I know she said I'd never get serious, but these days, I'm even thinkin' about gettin' married.
you know, so I can have that great sex all the time.
[ Chuckles ]
and hot damn, if Boca didn't just up and move to Boca.
I can see him right now, helping some lost soul, sayin', -"Do your thing. " -Do your thing.
and me, I retired again, like you probably figured.
but I didn't want to go out without leavin' the fellas a little somethin' to remember me by.
even though I left the game,
I couldn't stay too far from it, so I bought me that song.
# Out of the tree of life #
# I just picked me a plum #
Stan: And that's the whole story.
like my baby Mo says, "It's all about figurin' out who you are."
and some of that's just a matter of gettin' a little older and acceptin' it.
and I can deal with that.
just 'cause I'm retired don't mean I'm invisible.
in fact, I'm guessin' you've probably seen my commercial once or twice yourself.

how can l?
I need a girl for that.
and I can't get married before Sam-yong does.
don't even go there.
this is a color television. Awesome, isn't it?
I didn't know these flowers were pink.
pick them.
Where'd you get the money?
you gambled again, didn't you? You're unbelievable!
I wouldn't call it gambling.
what I play is a game.
look at Sa-yong.
why can' t you get a job like him?
life is all about one opportunity.
once I get my break, I'll give you a luxurious life, and I'll marry her off.
you're all talk!
come on, don't hit your son.
Hey!
turn it gently clockwise.
that red shirt is so tacky! - Mom, this is amazing.
where did Sa-yong go?
Sa-yong!
Sa-yong!
guidelines for Managers
I got you.
I can't believe this.
would you buy me a drink?
I feel like getting drunk.
I like you so much.
your chiseled face, and your perfect smile...
look at those horses running freely out there.
I'd like to run as freely as those horses.
you're a Baduk shark! It's snowing.
what do you say?
did I sound like an actress?
Sa-yong, ignore her.
she's just one of those actress wannabes.
look, our company is starting a professional baseball team.
Sa-yong, are you interested?
I know the coach for the team.
me?
come on.
I don't think I'm good enough.

Sammi Superstars

playing at the company wasn't enough?
you'll quit your job?
Sa-yong, good thinking!
we have no money, no name.
life is all about one opportunity. Don't let it slip away.

tryouts for Pitchers
I don't like the name.
superstars? Come on!
we don't have one star player on the team.
you read my mind.
lions, Tigers, Dragons...
other teams are all animals.
why can't we be Kingkongs, Cobras, or Jaws?
superstars my butt!
what are you doing?
I have business to attend to.
outside the bathroom window?
that's not important. There's a nail on the windowsill.

I won't ask what it's about.
don't worry. My lips are sealed.
how about it?
I will live.
no, not that.
how do I look? Tell me what you think.

gorgeous.
I'm going to an audition. I hope to make it this time.
you will.
last time in the office, you were like an actress.
Lee-ran!
put your shirt on! Why'd you put oil on yourself?
that's enough.
no vegetable ones?
what number are we?
finding players via tryouts is like fishing for dragons.
no dumplings? I don't like steamed bread.
no. 33, GAM Sa-yong?
Gam Sa-yong?
fine.
no 34?
wait!
wait!
I'm GAM Sa-yong.
I'm here.
this is a waste of time.
what?
it's just that...
he's close to the plate.
so I wanna throw some curve balls inside.
is that okay with you?
good luck.
What'd he say?
he likes your batting stance.
he has sharp eyes.
the pitch is too slow.
into the center field... Out!
what were you thinking? You're in charge of production!
I'm sorry. It was an urgent matter.
but I told him ahead of time.
where did you go?
I was gonna tell Lee-ran that...
I can't believe you people
running away on duty?!
let me tell you the truth.
yesterday, I was... - Sir?
you got a call.
stay right here. I'm not done with you guys yet.
where the hell did you go? - Don't take it out on me.
don't talk back to me!
don't speak back to me.
I'm your superior!
you went to another audition!
what do you care? - I know you did.
attention please.
everybody, listen!
I got a call from the head office concerning personnel changes.
I saw this coming, Sa-yong.
I'm so sad to announce that he is leaving us as of today.
he'll be transferred out of here.
where is he transferring?
Sammi Superstars!
Gam Sa-yong!
congratulations, GAM Sa-yong.

those of the same feather!
we're fish out of water.
look, the big shots are all together.
those national team players!
look over there. KlM Woo-yeol for OB Bears.
KLM Sung-han for the Tigers.
baek ln-cheon for the Dragons, NOH Sang-su for the Giants.
Geum Gwang-ock for...
what's he doing there?
does he know them?
Where's the men's room?
I don't know.
the one with the long hair, he's PARK Chul-soon.
having played in America, he's all over the TV lately.
is he that great?
he misses the pitch!
he should've caught it.
go! Go!
an error made by HEO.
he catches it, but the runner comes home.
stop! Go back!
they allowed a run that they shouldn't have.
what an exciting game.
top of the ninth, tied at 4, Dragons are on the offense.
appearing at bat is BAEK ln-cheon.
he's an old but powerful hitter.
dragons need a run to win the game.
he played so many seasons in Japan.
he's a great slugger. Let's see how he does it.
the batter sucks! Inside is his weak point.
throw it inside!
you heard him!
come on, go for it!
one pitch will decide victory or defeat.
how will he deal with him? We'll have to see.
Superstars' ace VS Dragons' slugger, what a match-up!
he hits it!
it's out of here! Home run!
a 3-run home run for the Dragons!
it's okay.
1 win 5 losses are nothing.
as you know, we're the weakest of the 6 teams.
losing is no surprise.
you learn a lot from losing. If you win all the time, you don't appreciate it.
damn pimple!
we didn't train for nothing last winter.
the last man standing is a true winner.
don't forget that.
he had a fast start, but hesitated in front of the base
show him your stuff!
we're not in good enough shape yet.
Sammi is in big trouble.
they've lost 5 straight games.
I got it!
Damn!
but our team spirit is stronger than any other teams'.
another error...
Sammi has problems with the defense. All of them are at fault
Sammi Superstars 8 losses in a row!
you called that a strike?
get your eyes checked!
he has a Major Leaguer look but sucks out there.
look at him frowning.
get out of the way!
go! Go!
go back!
ah he shouldn't do that. He ignored the coach and ran home
he needs to follow the coach's directions
it's very hard to believe they're professional players.
we'll regroup for the next game and do our...
Damn!
Sammi - 1 2 losses
they might beat us to death.
let's just go.
what should we do?
wait.
I will be a dragon.
he's the pitcher!
run!
Hi!
did you like that fish jerky? I threw in one more for free.
Oh!
it was so good.
what are you doing here?
going somewhere?
what?
no, I sell tickets at the ballpark.
you do? - Bought things for the shop?
what?
Oh, it's...
you can have this.
Bye.
park Chul-soon
wait!
keep it. I know you're his fan.
I'm not his fan.
I also play...
take it back.
I'm not the owner of that shop!
I'm GAM Sa-yong, a baseball player!
my name is GAM Sa-yong!
Gam Sa-yong!
Gam Sa-yong!
it's okay. No need to thank me.
where is he?
right there!
I love you, Chul-soon!
what?
go, Chul-soon! You're so great!
What'd you run into me for?!
go practice.
why is he bothering Chul-soon? Who is he?
the guy from the market!
I can't believe they didn't feed you.
your brother got a job starting tomorrow.
there's actually a job for you?
he's driving a cab.
they're very short-handed, and I'm a good driver.
you took the test 10 times.
9 times! One time I didn't go.
try these crabs.
happy playing baseball without a job?
it's a job too. I'm still with the company.
you have no idea how good he is.
he's a treasure of the team.
you know those who are good don't' usually brag.
look at me. The quiet make it big!
isn't PARK Chul-soon the best pitcher in the league?
adults are talking here. Don't interrupt.
what have I taught you?
keep on jumping rope!
I've done enough tonight.
you have no idea, Mom. They call Sa-yong unbeatable.
the batters look pitiful swinging.
right, Sa-yong?
you can say that.
I also become quite beatable once in a while though.
you know BAEK ln-cheon?
that guy in the commercial? - Right.
"I'm freaking good!"
watch your mouth, girl.
that's what he says.
I faced him in yesterday's game. Let me tell you.
he was so dominating at the plate.
he played in Japan, you know.
right.
today I was warming up before the game.
running and all that.
and Chul-soon begged me to warm up with him.
park Chul-soon did? - Of course.
so you let him?
he was such a pain in the neck. So I told him no.
you shouldn't have. - He's from the opposing team.
he considers me his rival or something.
Really?
Thanks.
Hi.
you're so cute. Stay with your uncle.
stop it.
what are you doing?
your dinosaur-like face is scaring her.
so cute!
Mr. IN.
want my autograph?
are you nuts? What would I want it for?
by the way, didn't I tell you not to mister me?
will you ever get to play?
you know I'm a secret weapon. They're saving me.
once I get out there, they're done for.
that's right.
we're the last on the standing. I wonder what they're waiting for.
here you go.
Bye.
autograph please.
my hands are shaky after so many autographs.
Gam Sa-yong? Is that your real name?
your name?
park Eun-ah. My name is SHlN Hye-young.
not that I want one.
sorry about the other day. I didn't know you were a player.
no, that's okay.
I can't believe you took him for a guy from the market.
I don't blame you though.
Thanks.
Bye.
bases are loaded
a hit!
they missed it
they ran into each other trying to catch the ball
the score is 1 0 to 1
that's the 17th hit for the team.
God damn it! You pitchers are pathetic.
how do you allow 10 runs every game?
I feel like I'm playing with Little League players.
Hey!
are you talking to me?
you think I'm happy?
calm down.
yang Seung-gwan!
how can you...
damn, he's at it again.
move the balls!
why do you always blame the pitchers for losing?
you think this is funny?
how many wins do you have?
you're the ace of our team. What do you have to show for?
don't you feel ashamed for your wife and kid?
son of a bitch!
Hey, come on! - Cut it out!
let go!
say that again, asshole!
you call yourself a pitcher?
you never play.
they hired you because we needed a lefty.
shut the hell up! - Quit it!
a transferred employee? Is this a construction site?
get real, losers.
let go! -Calm down.
let go!
why the ruckus? What's going on here?
nothing, Coach.
get off me!
Sa-yong, get ready.
what?
but we're losing this one.
Moon-hyun looks tired. You can help him.
whatever
Sammi is changing pitchers.
Gam Sa-yong relieves Moon-hyun.
top of the ninth, 10 to 1, GAM Sa-yong is on the mound.
last defense for Sammi.
it's his first appearance, and the team is losing 10 to 1.
he's a losing-game closer.
closing a losing game is like doing the dishes after everybody's done eating.
no doubt nobody likes that.
we have to end the broadcast due to the regularly scheduled program.
get some seaweed. It's very good.
I was a relief yesterday.
I was in a great condition.
get ready
every ball I threw was a strike.
I was awesome.
I made a careless pitch, and the batter didn't miss it.
the ball flew high in the sky...
left fielder!
this left fielder of our team made a diving catch.
that fool!
that felt so good, Mom.
take a look.
it's very good.
at three balls and two strikes, I threw a curve ball, and...
Moon-hyun was so tired.
who would the coach turn to?
you?
of course! Who else?
others wouldn't relieve him so I volunteered.
Moon-hyun went on and on how thankful he was.
I think I got used to losing.
I don't get upset any more.
tell me about it.
when we were winning tonight I was so nervous.
but as they came from behind, I felt comfortable.
is that why you laid an egg? It was deliberate, wasn't it?
I'd call that an involuntary act.
what a team!
don't like what you have? Then leave.
are robes in here?
you should've knocked!
is he wearing girl's panties?
Yeah, make fun of me. Go ahead!
Damn!
why'd you put it here?
What'd you say?
not upset about losing?
how do you expect to win with that attitude?
what do you weigh? - 74 kilograms.
let me tell you.
my daughter brought me two pairs of girl's panties, saying I'd win the games with them on.
I didn't know whether or not I should believe her at first.
but I shouldn't wear them inside out.
we're on a losing streak.
you're unbelievable. - 1 5 games, right?
just to stop the losing streak, I wear my wife's panties.
this is the attitude I have! Learn from me, boys.
focus, guys! Focus!
what a weirdo
shut up!
they're for you.
what are these, Mr. IN?
come on, what'd I say? Don't mister me.
that's the last pair I have.
I wouldn't give them to anyone else.
and remember.
don't wear them inside out.
no way, I don't...
listen to me.
will they fit me? - Sure.
they're silk. - Very stretchable.
keep them.
be thankful.
they're like an amulet.
they'll bring you good luck.
let's go!
hold on!
why do you carry that all the time?
Gam Sa-yong?
it's a long story.
I can't even believe he made it to a professional team.
Gam Sa-yong... It's actually a person's name?
that's him, isn't it?
the weather forecast is right for the first time in a while.
why do you play baseball?
what?
because I love it.
I've always loved it since I was a little kid.
that's great, doing what you wanna do.
I have a dream too.
yeah?
what is it?
don't laugh if I tell you. Promise?
I promise. - You're already laughing.
fine. Now tell me.
don't laugh.
a cop.
funny, huh?
I'm good at remembering faces, and I once caught a thief.
hard to believe?
a female cop... Isn't it awesome?
and my favorite TV program is 'Cops.'
she did become an actress.
her breasts are huge.
wanna watch 'Giant Grapes'?
What'd you say it was?
a cop.
where?
what's wrong with him?!
I'm sorry. I should've blocked you.
it's okay. Let me.
I'm sorry.
why can't they drive carefully?
splashing pedestrians...
Damn!
these belong to the wife of another pitcher.
they're like an amulet to break the jinx.
I told him I didn't want them!
I couldn't say no, could l?
he wanted me to have them so I could win.
he's a good friend, and I couldn't let him down.
come on, don't give me that look.
here's the bus! Stop!
see you later.
Eun-ah, I just...
Eun-ah!
you misunderstood!
you know what?
you guys keep saying I only look like a Major Leaguer.
do I look that scary?
Yes. - A little bit.
Sa-yong, you think so too?
no.
that's not important.
right?
Hey!
what the hell are you doing after the game?
you forgot me!
I can't believe you guys.
raw fish?
what are you reading?
park Chul-soon on a 1 9-game-winning-streak?
he won again?
give it here.
look here. They're so sure he will shut us out.
we haven't played yet. This is too much!
then again, we've never won against OB Bears.
how many losses? We're like their feed.
frankly, I really don't wanna pitch against him.
me neither. - Hey!
I'd like to win against the Bears once for all.
they play like hell against us.
why can't they let us win?
who would want us to win? They want their star to win.
that we get one more win, nobody takes it serious except us.
coach.
I know it's out of my line to tell you this.
what is it? I'm going to the bathroom.
I'm confident.
I can pitch as well as Ho-bong and Moon-hyun.
you might think otherwise, but...
I want to start.
why'd you hire me?
What'd you hire me for?
I never thought of you as a starter.
in whatever situation you are, do your best.
that's professional.
ball!
ball!
come on!
what do you have for eyes?
you call this a ball? Is this?!
you sure you're an umpire?
I'm talking to him!
show me your license!
the game is over! It's done!
this is No Contest!
justice prevails!
Sa-yong! It's me, your brother!
excuse me! Sir!
me? - Do you see anyone else?
I'll give you chance to apologize before I call the police!
about what?
do we need to go to the police?
or are you gonna apologize?
what are you talking about? Why do I have to go to the police?
pervert!
you just touched my butt!
with your right hand! Like this!
you're crazy.
you don't even have nice ass.
let's drop this, ok? You're wasting my time.
stop!
you crazy bitch! You're insane!
shut up, you pervert!
as a representative of sex crime victims,
I'll not tolerate scum like you!
the truth will be told!
let go of me! I'll go there myself!
yes... Yes, sir.
what a zealous activist...
look, miss. The man is suing you.
the hospital said you hurt his neck.
what are you gonna do? You have to talk.
how is it going, officer JlN?
isn't she the new dentist?
you know her?
she's Mr. HONG's... you know?
no way...
they spent the night together last night.
Really? She slept with Mr. HONG?
that's what I heard.
in any case, where is Mr. HONG when his girlfriend is in jail?
do you need anything else?
I think this should settle the matter.
can we go now?
uhm... Thanks for helping me out.
nothing happened last night, right?
man... You're hopeless...
what? Did something happen?
did you black out last night?
don't you remember anything?
you said you wanted us to be friends. Don't you remember?
please lend my shoulder, just 5 minutes
you babbled on about how much you need a man's shoulder to lean on...
forget it. Just forget it.
why do I even bother...
so whether you like it or not, you gotta find someone to marry.
because you have to get married!
marriage is a crazy thing.
then are you not gonna get married and die all alone?
of course not!
I'll get married and have kids and live happily ever after!
tell me the truth!
are you waiting for a prince charming to show up and sweep you off your feet?
who doesn't like the idea of a prince charming?
there is your prince charming.
testing, testing.
I bet the singer caught a cold.
I'm filling in for Cheol-shik.
he has a cold.
a nice round of applause would help me muster up enough courage to sing.
you can do it, Mr. HONG!
As...Sorry. I'm sorry.
let's try this again.
as I count the stars in the sky,
I hear your voice.
I wish to be a fine flower dust that gently lie on your petals.
as I gaze at the night sky,
I can feel your breath.
I wish to float in a small boat that stays in your lake.
if you ever leave me,
I'll follow you till the end.
my love, I hold you in my arms...
what happened?
you should drive more carefully.
what are you talking about? It was all your fault!
you slammed on your brake and what was I supposed to do?
do you how much this car cost?
more than your husband's retirement fund!
husband?
fine! Talk to my insurance company.
what a shitty day!
let's just settle it here.
how much do you want?
I said I'll give you the money now.
it's not about the money.
you could've just apologized.
it's not a big accident anyway.
you want me to apologize, huh?
I'm sorry.
I'm so fucking sorry.
OK?
dumb bitch! I'm leaving.
what the hell?
Oh, I'm really sorry too! So sorry!
call my insurance! They'll take care of everything! Bye!
you crazy bitch!
we're closed for the day.
I need to speak with Dr. YOON. - Mi-sun!
Hello, Doctor.
you got yourself in a big trouble this time.
under Para. 1 of Art. 50 of the Road Traffic Act, you're under arrest for hit and run.
let's go.
wait! I'll go there myself! Hit and run? Whatever!
sir, I'm so sorry.
you little punk! Are you trying to give me a heart attack?
sir, I'll apologize for what happened.
please calm down!
I'll let it pass this time only because of you, Mr. HONG.
thank you very much. I'll make sure this will never happen again.
she's quite a lady.
what are you looking at, you little punk!
you think you're off the hook? - Sir, please!
drink!
it's the best remedy when you feel like shit.
drink and forget everything.
C'mon, drink.
aren't you gonna yell at me?
accidents happen.
though he doesn't drive well...
that kid was gonna get himself in trouble sooner or later.
you were just unlucky.
will you stop crying? It's not that big of a deal.
where is your confidence?
you should've given a little speech representing all drivers.
why are you looking at me like that?
how did you become such good friends with police officers?
about 3 years ago, I caught a few sneaky thieves for them.
and a few robbers.
I received couple of honorary citizen's awards, too.
why are you nice to me?
don't flatter yourself.
I'm just doing my job.
do you like me?
whatever!
Oh my god!
what are you doing here?
I heard you slept with Mr. HONG again.
everyone's talking about it.
no way! How do they know?
this is insane!
we're just friends, ok?
friends!
friends who sleep together?
that's usually called 'sex partners.'
don't get weird ideas!
nothing happened.
don't you believe me? - I believe you.
good. - So, how was it?
was it good? How many times did you do it?
3 times? I'm so jealous!
what are you doing here at this hour?
what's up!
what's wrong? - C'mon! Hurry!
wait! What are you doing? I'm cold! I'm not going! Stop it!
where are you taking me? Let go of me! Stop it!
just come! - To where?
come! - Stop it!
you want me to deliver a baby?
I'm a dentist, not an obstetrician!
I can't do it. I can't!
Yes, you can!
you just have to stay next to her.
the midwives will do the rest!
then why do I need to be here?
just watch over the whole thing.
wait!
doctor! Please help me!
I don't really know what to do...
she said she can't give birth without a doctor!
whatever you do!
don't worry! She's almost out! Push!
Oh my gosh! What do I do?
my beautiful baby...
I pray for my baby to grow up as smart and as pretty...as you...
there you are. I was looking all over for you.
Hey, doc.
Thanks. You did good.
are you her father or something? Why do you thank me?
just because. Thanks.
no, I should thank you.
thank you for the precious experience...
what are you thinking?
just thinking.
what kind of 'just thinking'?
I know! You're thinking about your first love, right?
no.
I'm thinking about the world that you couldn't possibly understand.
like what?
what can't I possibly understand?
how do you feel now?
I feel offended.
not that. How do you feel about this place?
it's nice. Quiet and clean air.
that's it?
what else is here?
close your eyes.
Why? - Just close them!
you must concentrate.
can you feel the moonlight reflecting on the ocean?
do you feel wind tickling your face?
doesn't it feel like the wind is asking you to play with him?
try to feel them all together...
so this is it. This is the world I didn't know.
it's so wonderful.
I did some background check for you.
are you interested?
what about?
what is it?
Mr. HONG's past.
why do you go around digging up other people's past?
how would you feel if someone else did it to you?
then forget it.
sit.
let's see. His name is HONG Doo-sik.
but he's known as Mr. HONG.
I know that already.
let's see.
both of his parents passed away in car accident before he even entered elementary school.
Really?
since he didn't have any relatives, he was to be sent to an orphanage.
however, he was a bright little boy and a grandpa...
who used to own a local rice store, adopted him as his son.
the townspeople shared all the cost, such as education and others.
when he was a kid, he wasn't a big boy.
but, with his guts, he ruled all the neighboring schools.
in another words, he was a legendary character.
no way.
Oh, and he's got some nerves that he even scares off ghosts.
I'm a virgin ghost...
stop crying!
no way! Even a ghost?
please don't tell anyone.
you little weakling!
don't get funny ideas!
I didn't!
what else?
after his grandpa passed away of a heart attack, he's been living by himself in that warehouse.
heart attack?
I see. - That's it!
Oh, and there is one more strange thing about him.
what?
there are unexplained 3 void years of his life.
according to what I found, he went back to school after his army service.
but the 3 years after school...
till he came back to this town are missing.
some say...
he was a spy who was sent to North Korea.
others say he was the translator at Korean-American Conference.
there is also a rumor that he was a big time ClA agent.
that sounds preposterous.
I also heard he swam across the Atlantic Ocean.
but, none of these stories have been proven.
so they don't mean a thing.
that's it!
now it's your turn to talk. - About what?
you have to promise me you're not gonna tell anyone!
I promise.
Mr. HONG and l...
we kissed. - Really? How far did you guys go?
what do you mean?
I mean, there are different kinds of kisses.
a light peck or a deep... - It wasn't like that!
you liked it, huh?
it wasn't bad.
so what's the problem?
we can never be in that kind of relationship.
it was just that night...
so you're saying nothing happened and you guys are just friends.
right.
this is the best picture!
Dr. YOON's office.
may I speak with Dr. YOON, please?
who? - YOON Hye-jin, please.
Hye-jin? May I ask who this is?
someone she knows.
someone she knows... Someone she knows.
someone she knows?
are you looking for your girlfriend? - This is her father.
Mr. YOON?!
why do you always make my life more complicated?
what are you gonna do now?
what can I do?
you father already hates me.
it's always that big mouth of yours that causes trouble!
what?
so you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend in front your father?
that can't be that hard.
Really?
of course.
50 bucks a day, right?
sure. - Ok.
you're looking good, sir.
you're looking better yourself, miss.
you should come by sometimes.
even though he doesn't show it,
I know your father misses you much.
I can tell by just looking at him.
it's been over 30 years, you know?
are you sure it's not you who misses me more?
perhaps.
he calls you 'miss'?
should he call me 'mrs.' then?
what the hell are you thinking?
use your head, boy!
young people now days all act like they're big shots, but inside, they don't know how to do anything right.
you wanna give it a shot?
I remember what she said to me when she moved out from home.
she said my money smells like shit, not sweat.
she worked through college and never asked a penny from me.
I guess she wasn't qualified to receive any scholarships.
lately, she started to send me some money.
she said she wants to pay back every cent she ever got from me.
I agree.
it's important to have clean money dealings between family members.
pretty good.
where did you learn how to play chess?
I used to play with grandpas in my neighborhood for a bowl of noodles.
what's your relationship with my daughter?
we're just friends. - Just friends...
yesterday, she asked me to pretend to be her boyfriend for a day.
in fact, now I work part tiime job - What do you mean? - We don't any special relationship
that's what we do. We help each other whenever we need help.
you accept money from your friends?
if they pay me, they feel better about asking me for help.
that's my way of earning money.
that's an interesting idea. I like it.
he's lasting pretty long.
a record breaker.
Hey! You! - What are you doing?
you can't do that!
withdraw your last move!
that's not gonna happen.
you little!
don't you have any respect for elders?
fine. I'll withdraw.
I was having such a good time until you made that last move.
now, it's finished! You lost!
Checkmate!
what? Are you toying with me?
you cheated! I don't want to play anymore!
get out of my face!
drive safely. - Take care of yourself.
I will.
Mr. YOON wants you to come by sometimes. When will it that be?
me?
I'm not sure.
I'll see you again.
goodbye. - Bye.
what are you doing tomorrow?
tomorrow?
Mr. KlM at the gas station asked me to come in for a day.
why do you live like that?
what's wrong with how I live?
it's pathetic and has no future.
why are you trying to start a fight?
it's you who's pathetic and has no future.
me?
what's wrong with me?
you're getting old and want to get married, but can't to find anyone who's good enough for you.
you're lonely and can't fall asleep.
you drink yourself to sleep and the next day you suffer from a hangover.
then you ask yourself, what's the point of living like this?
you're really annoying!
where are you going?
home!
aren't you gonna pay me?
if I don't, are you gonna sue me?
pay me!
sue me!
pay me!
Hi! How was business yesterday?
it was ok.
I really like the lighting in my office.
Thanks.
you got new stuff in? - They came in this afternoon.
grandma, how your new denture?
it's good.
stop by sometimes. - Ok. Thanks.
I like your new hairdo. Did you get it done at a hair salon?
where are you going? - To the market.
you kids! Don't smoke!
it's bad for your teeth!
what do you think?
doesn't it look different with a new paint job?
I guess.
what's wrong? Do you need help with something?
Mr. HONG, let's do something together.
we are doing something together.
not like this.
like going out on a date.
what are you talking about?
I'm a dentist and you're a handyman.
I think this is a good deal for you.
what do you say? Yes or no?
I'm sorry but...
I only think of you as a friend.
I just can't think of you like that.
I'm sorry.
I was joking. You took it so seriously.
I'm sorry. I thought you might have a wrong idea about us because of that night.
I'm sorry.
I'll see you later.
this is so embarrassing.
what's this?
can't you read? It's my resignation.
do you know what have changed and what haven't changed in past year?
the number of patients and your bank account have changed for the better.
what haven't changed are your apathy and the ever-busy nurse, me!
I think your skirt has gotten shorter, too.
it's not funny.
I will not allow myself to be the victim of overwork and low salary.
if that's how you really feel, I'll accept it.
how can you do this to me?
you know what I'm trying to say with this resignation!
I can't believe you're just gonna accept it!
I'm gonna close our office.
what are you talking about?
let's go back Seoul!
with the money we saved from here,
I'm sure we can get a decent space in the outskirts.
Hye-jin...
you're the one who wanted to go.
hello.
Hi.
ma'am, be careful!
is this another one of your day jobs?
this? No.
it's Myung-cheol's grandpa's work.
but he's too sick to come in today.
it only pays him 20 bucks a day but that's a lot money for an old man.
Mr. HONG! - What?
I'm closing my office.
Really? Why?
I got a call from my colleague about a good office space in Seoul.
Really? Good for you.
my lease isn't up yet, but you can take care of that, right?
I'm happy for you. Congratulations...
what? Do you have something to say?
Yes. - Say it!
I was thinking, if you don't think of me as a such a bad person, maybe we could have more positive relationship...
we could go on a date or go see a movie like normal people...
and maybe we could change in more positive way.
what? I couldn't hear you well. Say it again?
forget it. I'll see you later.
be careful!
Hey, Dr. YOON!
if you need any help, I'm always here to help you.
where are you going?
home.
you have a patient.
a patient? Right...
what's wrong with you all day?
I just like the sun.
what are you, a pigeon?
besides, it's not even light out.
he's been waiting for more than 20 minutes!
Really?
Hey, are you going to that Christmas party?
I don't think so. Go without me.
if it's a crime to be beautiful... then I might get executed.
Hye-jin, I was looking all over for you.
hello. How have You been?
good. Thank you.
I forgot to introduce you two!
this is Mr. NOH Do-cheol.
nice to meet you
I received couple of honorary citizen's awards, too.
would you like another drink?
no thank you. I don't drink much now days.
I'm gonna go out for some fresh air.
may I join you? - I prefer not. Thank you.
Hye-jin!
if you keep up this act, you're not gonna meet any men!
as you all know,
Cheol-shik went to Seoul for the audition of his life.
however, considering we haven't heard from him yet,
I assume the result is as same as the last one.
I know I have to forget you now...
the door to my empty room is closed...
and your scent still lingers on, filling up my empty room...
as I lay here all alone, you appear in front of my eyes...
as I turn to forget you... - Not like this.
tears silently flow down... - Like going out on a date.
everything is nothing more than memories of times forgotten...
but, the night seems endless and I can't seem to forget you...
the dawn finally arrives at my window...
my room seems to have grown...
on my white window,
I write and I erase... 'l love you. '
every night, the stars on the sky shine radiantly...
but in my heart, you're the only one...
you're my only star...
the dawn finally arrives at my window...
my room seems to have grown...
on my white window,
I write and I erase... 'l love you. '
I have to tell you something.
it's been a long time. How's work?
Doo-sik, do you remember you told me you want us to be good friends?
you should've called first.
would you like some tea?
I thought about what you said and.
I don't want to be your friend.
you and I can never be friends.
so, from now on...
you and I are nothing.
anyway, since we're no longer friends, even if you need a drinking buddy...
even if you're in trouble...
even if you're bored and lonely and even if you're deathly ill...
don't ever call me again.
that's what I wanted to tell you.
let's have a drink.
I thought maybe you might show up one day for a drink.
so I got everything ready for the day you might decide to come by again.
all of your favorites...
so I could change your mind about leaving.
Hye-jin...
can I have this drink with you?
of course.
Doo-sik... - Yes?
do you remember what I asked you before?
about your boat...
I asked you why you put it on a hill like a fool.
if I put it on the water,
I was afraid it might sail away by itself.
it's weird but when I love something or someone, they all leave me.
my parents... Grandpa who raised me...
I just wanted them to stay with me...
now, you can put your boat on the water.
I'm here with you.
Thanks.
Oh, and you have to pick me.
pick you for what?
next month, I'm gonna run for the district representative.
Really? So, now you're the new district representative?
maybe. We'll see.
Mr. HONG, the new district representative... That sounds weird.
you think? Why?
I don't know... Just because...
in gratitude, we honor you.
all veneration to you. Oh mighty...
say it. Say my name.
Mushu.
now, that's what I'm talking about.
Hey, how you doing up there, man? Thanks for the intro.
and now I think I'd like to visit my beloved pedestal.
let's get it over with.
ceremonial robe of honor.
if Mulan could see me now.
Mulan saves China one time, and now he thinks he's the emperor.
I'm climbing a stairway to heaven.
top floor.
pedestals, perks and props.
ceremonial bath of honor.
Yeah. You all better take a deep breath now, because I ain't leaving my pedestal for the next thousand years.
let the whirlpool begin.
Oh, yeah.
according to this chart, I put the coins here.
relax, child.
the spirits tell me Shang will arrive and propose to Mulan before the sun sets.
there's still time to get in on the pool.
mother.
gambling is like playing mah-jongg with blank tiles.
no one really wins.
I'm enriched by your presence, my son.
I think I'll go pray.
Hello, Sha Ron.
is Fa Mulan here? - Why, she's out in the field.
Yeah, doing her chores.
I'll go help her.
thank you.
the children all love Mulan.
and why not?
she's strong, she's brave, she's beautiful.
she's a chip off the old block.
hi... ya!
Hiya.
it's okay, Little Brother. What's going on here?
we wanna be like you, Fa Mulan.
ya! Ya! Hi... ya!
but I'm still learning myself.
please? - Teach us, Mulan.
show us. - Okay. I guess I can show a few moves.
Mulan's gonna teach us how to kick butt!
hold it. Calm down.
that's lesson number two.
the first and most important lesson is to be gentle at the same time we're being tough.
how can you be tough and gentle?
Yeah, I wanna be tough.
Yeah!
I know it does sound a little funny.
but the world is full of opposites, and so are you.
to be a good warrior, you must bring it all into balance.
let's see if this helps.
earth, sky, day, night.
sound and silence.
dark and light.
# One alone is not enough #
# You need both together #
# Winter, summer, moon and sun #
# Lesson number one #
# Like a rock. You must be hard #
# Like an oak. You must stand firm #
# Cut quick #
# Like my blade #
# Think fast #
# Unafraid #
# Like a rock I must be hard #
# Like an oak I must stand firm #
# Cut quick #
# Like my blade #
# Think fast #
# Unafraid #
okay, Mulan, I'm ready.
but you're still out of balance.
you're only halfway there.
# Like a cloud. You are soft #
# Like bamboo You bend in the wind #
# Creeping slow You're at peace because you know #
# It's okay to be afraid #
