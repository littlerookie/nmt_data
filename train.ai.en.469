roubini began studying these countries and soon identified what he saw as their common weaknesses.
roubini explains that any restructuring would have to rest on three pillars.
roubini is actually a bit more optimistic about the u.s. than he has been in previous years.
roubini predicted they could drop another 15 percent.
roubini reportedly believes the recent action by the fed and ecb will continue to make equities an attractive investment over the next few months.
roubini said it's difficult to accurately gauge the health of companies like merrill because their financial health depends on how they value complex securities.
roubini says the fed is caught in a position where it needs to do more to help the economy, but at the same time, it's beginning to create new bubbles.
roubini uses the asian financial crisis of the late '90s as an example of what happens when countries over-invest and under-consume.
roubini's latest warning came despite several pieces of upbeat news from the recession-hit us economy in recent days, including official figures released yesterday which showed that the pace of job-shedding is beginning to slow.
roubini's main point is that china's communist leaders have been fast and loose with money.
roubini, nicknamed dr. doom for his forecasts of the financial crisis, noted that even though the supply of money has expanded it hasn't changed very many hands, largely because banks have been hoarding cash in the form of excess reserves.
roubini, on the other hand, thinks that china, worried about growth, is likely to put off economic reform for another few years. "

roussanov says his research suggests that ceos, and more specifically their private lives, do matter, perhaps a little too much.
roussanov says it is possible that people who chose to be single are just risk-takers by nature, but he doesn't think that is the answer.
rousseau and marx both pay attention to ontological freedom and positive freedom. But they have a difference in the relation between freedom and law and also in the relation among freedom, moral and interests.
rousseau describes it as a general condition of humanity but also that it may never have existed.
rousseau propose the general will not only with his unique experience and the social background, but also on the influence of other thinkers, such as grotiusn hobbes and locke.
rousseau shares with hobbes the view that man is not by nature political, but rousseau thinks that hobbes commits the same fallacy as other philosophers who have written on the state of nature: hobbes attributes to natural man the passions and needs which he could only have acquired after the rise of reason and political society.
rousseau was a genius.
rousseau was an early and incisive critic of the idea that self-interested behaviour would necessarily work to the benefit of all.
rousseau would have made a sounder contribution towards a theory of the state, if he had always kept this distinction in sight.
Rousseau's "confessions" was completed in 1769 when antoinette was 14 years old and still living in austria.
