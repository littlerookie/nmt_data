Oh, I'm sorry, Tiffy.
you're sorry? - You knew him for years.
he was just a guy I met.
he was in love with you.
Yeah, well, not me.
never fall in love with a soldier, especially one pretending to be a logistics clerk.
that was my rule. - It's a good rule.
um, what happened? - They'll never tell us.
and you're ok with that?
I'm getting used to it. - Yeah, well, not me.
you know what i liked about Hector, that he was...
he was a straight shooter. - Right from the heart.
you want a tequila shot? - Yeah.
sorry.
that's water, baby.
that's water. Come on.
sergeant,
I'm the M. E... Captain Bowen.
let's see what we got here.
this is your buddy's chest cavity.
you've got a foreign object right here... a bullet.
and you were there when it was fired?
Yes, sir.
with your permission, I need to handle the body.
looks like it came through the neck here, snapping the cerebral cortex...
he wouldn't have felt anything...
and then into the chest cavity, where it lodged here.
that's what we figured.
downward angle, through here.
sniper.
I'm going to need the bullet. - Of course.
what's the cover story? - Play 16.
I'll issue the death certificate, and we'll prepare the remains for burial.
no traces of Beirut on the body.
we'll take care of him, sergeant, with respect and reverence.
I'll stay.
that's not necessary.
thank you, sir. I'll stay.
it's not the truth.
well, what do you want people to hear, the facts?
that's right. The facts.
you held a gun to an American soldier's head.
that's a fact.
you pulled the trigger. How's that for a creative headline?
the gun wasn't loaded. - You didn't know that.
you have one of our secrets, and we have one of yours.
you want to trade?
those are his personal bodyguards.
that would indicate that he's in there.
he's inside.
I can get you close to him...
slowly.
slowly works, all except the slow part.
there's a lot of men.
there's more inside.
they will die for him.
you turning shy?
revenge is a dangerous thing, my friend.
and I will not send my men to die for another man's anger.
I'll go in first. You don't like what you see, turn around and go home.
you're serious?
this mongrel sold you out to the butcher.
what do you suggest I do to him?
he's your problem.
he gave you up.
it's not safe to go.
he'll have more security.
because of this mongrel, the butcher will now expect you and kill you.
I'm still going.
he's your problem, not mine.
here's how i solve my problems.
now he's someone else's problem.
Granger, what are you doing?
gimme that.
what is this?
you're a murderer.
you publish these words...
they just killed people... they get me killed, and they get you killed.
you gave me your word. - I didn't give you anything.
I don't have anything to give.
make sense of this!
there are people ready to declare you an enemy combatant right now just to shut you up.
do you want to vanish?
you're threatening me. - No, I'm not threatening you. I'm your friend.
I'm the only friend you got. But I'm losing my patience.
then I want something.
if I'm going to chuck my journalism degree, I want something.
what? - The guy who died, your friend...
be very careful.
who was he?
what was he like?
you don't deserve it.
something... - you're not worthy of knowing his name.
something, please, to make this real.
please.
white house?
nsc.
it was my mission, the oversight.
so I feel connected to you and your colleague, sergeant williams.
you want water?
ice cubes? Anything?
you caught a bullet, huh? - Yes, sir.
I just wanted to drop by in person to offer our thanks, but I'm not here just as you weren't there.
I need to make sure we're all on the same page.
what page is that again?
you were there, and you took the hit.
your friend took the hit.
we're a team from the top down.
I want to make sure we've got it straight.
got it straight?
that none of it occurred.
you mean my friend, Hector williams, who was a good soldier, none of that occurred?
easy enough, right?
I'm looking for the senior chaplain.
I'm a chaplain, not the senior one.
will the senior chaplain be back?
there's a war happening. That's where he is.
Colonel Ryan's command issued a request for the chapel for thursday at 1200 hours.
he authorized me to... I have the paperwork.
please.
the deceased was with the 303rd logistics?
sergeant Hector williams.
you're related to the deceased? - No.
he worked with my husband.
the body will be sent to his hometown.
Yes, sir.
his family elected to bury him in a family plot.
he could have been buried at arlington. - Yes, sir.
and we'd like to do the memorial service for the unit here at the chapel.
we're doing a group memorial in two weeks.
I'm sorry. Did you say group memorial?
it's army policy.
we're short staffed and this is our 63rd memorial service so far this year.
if you want to look for a later date, that's what's available.
no.
we're authorized for a memorial service.
Colonel Ryan can confirm that.
if you want me to call him... - No, ma'am.
the last thing I need to do is bother a colonel.
as far as getting the chapel ready, I'll do what I can.
but we ran out of candles two months ago;
I don't even have a budget for windex;
I am sorry for your loss, but my staff is me.
your staff just doubled.
so at this press conference...
what do you want me to say?
what did jesus say to the revlon lady?
don't talk to me about nails.
you're a writer.
think of a daring escape. Write your ticket.
you're the hero of this story. That's what you really wanted, isn't it?
no.
what I wanted was to show the people the tragedy happening there.
the truth is talk shows, lecture circuits, a million-dollar book deal.
think about it.
you didn't become a priest, you became a journalist.
a man escapes from a half-dozen armed guards.
people will want to hear that story.
you tell that story, and people will listen to that man, if he wants to talk about Lebanon.
I plan to press disciplinary actions.
and you were up there...
checking his cover story. - And why?
to make sure... - to make sure that what, he held his water?
that's right.
what do you got in your pockets?
empty them out.
are you kidding? - No. Empty them.
Where's your body bag? - I don't have a body bag.
exactly. But each soldier in the unit carries their own body bag.
and until you carry one, you don't deserve to talk to my men about their code.
they signed on to not exist.
for them, there is no legacy.
these men die for each other, not for you or for your boss.
these men are warriors.
you think you need to remind them about their codes of silence?
they answer to a higher code, friend.
let's keep this meeting on point.
your man attacked me.
a seriously wounded man on his back attacked you?
Yes.
well, he may have dinged your ear, but I'll break your jaw.
now, get the hell off my base.
Hello, butcher, come on down.
we'll take the butcher and you.
you have understand things change.
you owe me from Tripoli.
the butcher's death will even the debt.
your last act on earth will be to see your enemy die.
he murdered my friend.
let me have the honor of killing him.
no, he's right.
one last gift.
imagine how this will play all over the world.
we got a boat to catch.
Hey.
got your message.
I just got, you know, these things going on in my head.
me, too.
I didn't know where else to go but here.
you were with him.
he just kept telling me I'd make it.
and we talked about you.
you know, he was crazy about you.
me, too...
about him.
I just needed to say that to somebody.
Hey. He knew.
I need your help. - Anything.
can you help me get out of here? - No way, soldier.
you were a medic. - Yeah. And do no harm to others.
you broke your scapula, and you have internal bleeding.
just take these out. - You're gonna need that for the pain.
OK, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, look at me.
where exactly do you think you're going?
Hector's parents are here at the apartment.
for how long? - I don't know.
they're packing up his things. I need to see them. I promised him.
good morning. - Mrs. Brown.
your service isn't for two days.
I know.
I bought supplies for your other services...
flowers, candles, windex.
you bought those?
Hey, mrs. Brown,
I held a sunrise service in the woods this morning for 19 wiccans...
all army.
that's my job... serve all faiths.
why are you doing this?
I want it to be a good service for all of them.
then you're a good woman.
no, I'm not good.
every time my husband goes on a mission, - I pray. - That's good.
no,
I pray that if someone has to die that it won't be him.
if someone dies,
I feel relieved for my baby, for my family, that it wasn't him.
this time, god answered my prayer with one of my husband's friends.
God answered my prayer.
Mr. And mrs. Williams, I'm Charles Grey.
you were hector's best friend. - Yes, sir. We shared this apartment.
I'm sorry. We just wanted to get his things.
no, ma'am. I understand.
do you want to sit down, son?
no, sir.
you were wounded? - Yes, ma'am.
with my son?
Yes, sir.
they didn't tell us. - No, ma'am, they wouldn'T.
look, I wanted to see you personally.
I promised Hector I would.
I know he'd have done the same for me.
thank you.
I made a pot of coffee.
I'd love that.
you were with Hector when he died?
I...I'm not going to lie to you.
there are things that I can't tell you.
and I'm not going to lie to you.
I don't need the details, just the essence.
the essence, sir, is your son saved my life.
we captured the butcher.
killed?
captured.
it was our mission, just like saving you.
that thing, that didn't happen.
you remember that?
that's right.
you ready?
the press is just on the other side.
he liked ice in his beer, the man who died, my friend.
he liked ice in his beer.
as his commanding officer, I need you to sign this form, releasing his body.
it's been an honor.
he's awfully pretty.
he always was.
time to go home, Hector.
detail, attention!
present arms!
order arms!
you brought him home.
that is a sacred duty. Well done.
I knew you'd go back.
you played me.
I know you.
not going back wasn't an option.
he was like a brother to me, colonel.
thanks for coming.
makes a lot of stuff seem unimportant.
do unit citations go flush or above?
flush on the pocket seam.
and are you going to put his regimental insignia on his uniform?
Yes.
and where was his home regiment?
18th infantry.
in omnia paratus.
in all things prepared.
no medals, right?
ribbons, yes. Medals, no.
he has a silver and bronze star.
and a purple heart.
and he'll be getting another purple heart?
his parents will.
what are you doing?
I'm spit-shining jump boots.
you shouldn't spit.
I need to see myself in them.
when are we going to tell her?
Marc, you escaped single-handedly.
you got yourself out of beirut.
how does it feel to be an instant hero?
I'm not.
there's talk of a book, maybe even a movie deal.
how does it all make you feel?
lucky, very lucky.
but being a prisoner for so long gave me a lot of time to think...
about the political situation in Lebanon... - that's good enough.
not yet, it's not.
Hey.
came to get my dress uniform.
um, I moved it.
you being here without an M. P. could get you fired.
guess I'm counting on you not to turn me in.
quiet.
I need you to get this in Hector Williams' hometown newspaper...
first class sergeant Hector Williams was transporting documents across an airfield in turkey, when an unexploded ordnance blew up, rolling his jeep.
he died instantly.
the 303rd logistics unit and the fort griffith command expresses their condolences.
his whole life he's been defending his country, and at the end that's what he's going to get?
that's play 16.
run it.
and what greater love hath any man but to give his life for his brothers?
Amen.
here, sir.
here, sir.
here, sir.
here, sir.
sergeant Williams.
sergeant first class Hector Williams, born november 16, 1976, oldest son of George and Carole Williams, killed in action.
in 1979, congress authorized the formation of a contingent of elite special forces soldiers who answer only to the president of the united states.
their missions and their very existence are closely guarded secrets protected by the soldiers themselves and their wives, who possess secrets of their own.
fire!
they are known only as the unit.
thirty-two seconds start to close - 32 second.
jerusalem, israel not much left of the robot is there?
we'll salvage what we can
and so, you see that is the problem.
what's the solution?
this is professor shemesh.
good to meet you, sir.
your embassy in beirut.
the marine barracks.
the first world trade bombing.
you can turn on the lights
our exercise today is penetration-in-depth.
so theoretically, you have an infinite amount of bombers that can penetrate-in-depth at any length.
is that the answer?
never was a horse that couldn't be rode.
never was a rider couldn't be throwed.
there is an answer to every problem and a problem for each answer.
can you solve the problem?
well, we're the defenders, you're the opfor?
that's right.
we can attempt it.
Mr. White, care to summarize the situation?
uh, penetration-in-depth.
if one perimeter can be breached, any number can be breached.
I'd say we're looking at a real new problem.
no, actually we are looking at a-- quite an old problem.
the romans knew the answer to this attack-in-depth.
each suicide bomber allows the next attacker to get closer to the target and so on, but can you can you decipher it?
you know the answer.
I think I do.
I think I do.
you tell me.
bring it back tomorrow.
we'll see if we agree and, uh, my friends reach the same conclusion.
because if you can, they can, and that may help us anticipate their countermove.
do your intelligence officers know where the bad guys are planning to use this leapfrog tactic?
washington, D.C.The white house.
OK.
ancient siege warfare
secret service is lookin' for recommendations.
I imagine they're losin' some sleep over this one.
well, I'm sure they'd prefer to lose some sleep than their jobs.
OK, then let's crack it.
the pro. suggest that the secret to the problem of incursion-in-depth can be found in the construction of the ancient battlement.
the ancients didn't have gunpowder.
well, then that's our first hint, now, isn't it?
what do we do to render gunpowder ineffective?
give it to a pacifist.
Heh. What else? Come on.
you hungry, soldier?
Oh, yeah.
well, let's feed you, then.
no protection?
weapons ?
detachment fifteen so you say. i think i should search you.
dream on who's your boyfriend?
he's michael jackson's hairdresser give me a break he have a weapon?
he wants to know if you're carrying a gun.
why would I be carrying a gun?
they make me look fat.
we were bombed last year.
OK, here we have-- thank you--a castle.
now, the problem that he has left us with
suppose an infinite amount of attackers, all right?
no one has an infinite amount of attackers.
boss, the dude went to college.
let him rant on.
What'd you learn in this college, bro?
well, you had to be there.
all right, here we have a roman battlement.
I'm sorry, what?
uh, he fell off his camel.
Rebecca, first time she saw isaac, she fell off her camel.
it's from the torah.
I think you say,"he fell head over heels.
OK, now, here's what they did, and here's what we have to do.
which is?
to think 3-dimensionally.
essentially, it's-- - damn it, boy, I like the way you're thinkin'.
you see where I'm goin'?
I see where you're goin'.
you're goin' up.
I'm goin' up.
now you're talking, young sergeant.
now if you look at that and look here and if we consider-- .
money makes the world go round
look how much they want for that knife.
$400 for a knife?
looking for a birthday present for mack-- parachute knife.
things getting tight all over.
you short?
could crawl under a snake with a top hat on.
need some help?
Oh, aren't you a good friend?
best there is.
see you later.
after the library.
and pay your late fines.
it's just a library fine.
your father makes a living jumping out of airplanes for his country for less money than the civilian world pays for some entry-level clerk, all right?
the world is not fair, and knowing that, we must protect ourselves.
there's only so much money in the world, liss.
your choices are inherit it, work hard, get lucky, or steal.
I mean, the money's gotta come from somewhere, liss, to pay our debts, to start you and your sister in life.
every penny all right. All right.
I'll see you at home.
you have to take me to cheerleading.
Kim! Hey, kim!
I--I left home without my wallet!

thank you.
they're my husband'S.

Lord, no.
not for--that'd be going on 22 years.
I'm getting old.
it's 24 years.
are you selling his things, ma'am?
I hope they will.
could I ask you about the cap?
Yes.
that was his.
he wore it in england, in france, of course.
they were all proud of it.
well, might you sell it to me?
we have a friend who's a paratrooper.
is he on active service?
that he is.
I'd give it to you.
it's like the castle, the--the white house.
uh, an embassy, it's like a castle.
there's always a point, like the drawbridge, where no traffic, friend or foe, can did I call home?
what time is it back home?
Mr. White, I can't get a signal. Let me use your phone?
maybe you could take me - What?
0900, resemble as before.
uh, boss- - see you in the morning.
may I?
how do you bust out any problem?
both: What would the other guy do?
I'm a suicide bomber, what's the one thing I don't wanna see?
come on, guys.
clock's ticking.
it's a roman coin.
it's beautiful.
in latin,"the campaign for the fall of jerusalem.
the fall of jerusalem.
that's not latin.
no. It's hebrew.
what does it say?
it says,"never again.
that's from shrapnel, a bomb.
my brother was wearing this when he died.
he died in battle?
no.
he died in a cafe in tel aviv with his wife and child.
may they rest in peace.
what do you fellas do, really?
Really?
that's right.
um we're a studies group.
Oh. I see.
too bad.
I always was a sucker for a fighter.
do you know some of those battlements are still standing?
begging your pardon.
you say some of those battlements are still standing?
Yeah, that's right.
Really?
I'd like to see them.
well, we could see them, but they aren't precisely in our territory.
sometimes you gotta go off the reservation.
am I right?
you wanna go someplace you can't tell your wife about?
I don't have a wife.

I spent a lot of time here waiting for the bus.

see those battlements?
Yeah.
there it is.
a woman was coming in to drop off a consignment.
that's her stuff.
Yes.
and I bought a piece from her outside, and my daughter correctly reminded me that in doing so, we deprived you of the commission, so well, what'd you pay for the piece?
well, why don't you just keep the piece, and we'll call it even?
that wouldn't be right.
well, no, you told me, and I told you it'd be just fine.
it's a pleasure to meet a woman of honor.
well, I tell you what. I tell you what.
I just want it for the patch, so how about I take the patch, and you keep the cap?
it's heavy.
paratroopers, they sewed a heavy metal washer behind the badge.
in a bar, they'd put the cap through their belt, and in case of trouble, they used it for a blackjack.
man: Excuse me, ma'am.
I'll be right with you.
uh, she leave her name?
what?
the women who left the consignment, she leave her name?
I don't know how to pay her.
no. She
how much is this?
that's a nice piece.
in good shape, too.
is the coin worth anything?
you see that proof mark?
well, what you've got here is a coin worth, say I'd say $800.
800?
well, actually it's worth more than that.
this is yours to sell?
uh, well, technically I'm a part owner, but yes, it's mine to sell.
I'd give you $900.
sold.

I've just got to find my- - well, actually, I have to take my daughter to cheerleading.

well, there you have it.
coin guy takes $200 fair profit, and everybody goes home a winner.
come on. Let's get you to cheer
variations include for the year 1921, the coveted denver d proof mark double-struck.
they're closing at lunch.
the only copies known to exist - I have no idea what that means.
it means that if the "d" proof mark is double-struck, that increases the value of the coin.
well, fine. Fine.
and is ours, uh, struck twice?
Yes, it is.
and how rare is it?
only 4 copies are known to exist.
well, fine, and what does that make the value of the coin?
100000
almost ready.
let the sun rise.
sleep through the day.
tomorrow we make our delivery.
they are bombers.
get some sleep.
you're relieved.
they're discussing the site of their attack.
OK, let's get out of here.
he's going to say the site of their attack.
hey're going to bomb the school bus.
they have the bomb with them?
the animals are gonna take this with one of the children on the bus
Ah. Heh. Some coffee?
no.
where is Sergeant Zahav?
get her in, I want her see this.
OK.
all right. And please get us some coffee.
now, what is the answer?
the terrorists leapfrog any new barriers we erect.
they can, in theory, destroy and encroach in-depth.
do you have an answer?
I think we do.
A--the problem is the decisions on fortification have been made by governmental parties not directly subject to attack.
that is, they look on it as a problem of architecture.
man on the ground sees a different problem.
to him, it's perimeter defense.
to him, the answer's simple.
here is the answer.
however deep the encroachment is linearly, they cannot encroach vertically.
this.
Hey, guys...
Where's mr. White?
Hey.
all right.
look, the guy won't go to sleep.
we can't go out that way.
it's gettin' on for noon.
he'll call 'em to pray, probably out here.
then we go out the hole.
and if they see us?
if it comes down, just stay behind me. Ok?
we're gonna use the handgun to get to the long gun.
you got the bus pass?
Yeah.
give me half.
we have a little flashbang.
if you see me move, you light it, throw it outside, start shouting commands to the rest of your men.
then you light and throw the other one.
keep shouting.
Hey, I do it for a living.
there you are.
I called. You didn't answer.
no. I, uh...
what are you doing?
I was just
lissy indicated that she was interested in a new hobby.
in coin collecting?
Yeah. Surprised me, too.
may I borrow mack's truck to go up the street as my husband's vehicle is in the shop?
of course.
I know where it is.
$100, 00. 00=80, 000 Condition? Discount? Finders Fee? Taxes?
I don't mean to pry, but our mutual friend indicated that you might be having a crisis in liquidity.
you need a little help till payday, old-timer?
I--heh. I have to take a trip.
if I
I think I have to go out of town tonight, and can you watch the kids?
of course.

um, yes.
you can't do better than them.
well, I can't stay, so...
if I can, I'd be glad to help you.
are you buying or selling?
Oh. 1921.
Yes, this is very nice.
Oh, my god.
may I?
do you know what you have here?
Yes.
a 1921 denver "d" double-struck.
this coin--this coin is worth a fortune.
you came to sell it?
Yes.
have you done business before with the adamses?
have you spoken with them?
no. I saw their ad.
because I'll tell you why.
if you had, I couldn't in good faith make an offer if you'd begun any negotiation with him, but if you would like to sell this coin to me,
I could give you...some handling wear.
light indentation on the rim.
$87, 000. Cash. Tomorrow.
$87, 000 in cash?
the coin may be worth somewhat more, but as you can see, it's far from mint.
you wouldn't get my price at an open auction, and you'd have to pay commission.
commission, yes.
but I know that I have a buyer
Yes. I'll take it.
this is an honor...
just to hold this coin.
I assume you know little of coins.
and why would you assume that?
because you touch it.
this coin...is a treasure.
it is a museum piece.
it must never be touched.
the oil in human hands.
it'll take me some time to assemble the cash.
can you meet me tomorrow here at 9 A. M?

thank you.
your man mr. White did not return to his hotel.
you tried his cellphone?
accidentally in my possession.

last seen with a member of your unit with all appearances.
sergeant zahav?

she's gone off withe the American.
Colonel, if my man violated any protocols...
I couldn't care what he's done. I care where he is.
she said she wanted to show him the spot.
to show him what?
The--uh, the coin around her neck, a roman coin.
he said he wanted her to take him to show him the spot.
it's the roman citadel of capulum.
photo infrared. Morning overflight.
in Sector Eight hwat have they seen? Right now.
eighteen kilometers, southeast.
could she have taken him with her?
I hope to god not.
it's the other side of the line.
she armed?
if they take your man, my sergeant...
what the hell am I going to tell the minister?
is she armed?
what difference does that make?
let's see what they saw.
what's the license number of her car?
Yeah. This is her car.

footprints suggest 2 from the israeli side, 5 or 6 from the other side, none exiting.
one of my soldiers and an active duty American Special Forces operative are in the west bank ...and may be in armed contact with Hamas.
let's get to the helicopter, to the helicopter.
I'm--I'm sorry. You need to stay here.
your soldier, our man.
all right, on the helicopter, but not across the line.
the man who lets the Americans cross the line will answer to me personally.
is the girl armed?
Yes. Why?
because if they have a weapon, my man will shoot his way out.
I thought what I was trying to do was figure out what I owed whom, and really,
I was trying to reason how much I could keep and not feel guilty.
well, yes. That would indicate you're human.
what is the right thing to do?
the coin belonged to an old woman.
you can't locate her. You bartered in good faith.
your friend gave you the money to buy the...
cap.
you then discovered that you had your wallet, so although my friend gave me the money and although I didn't need it, she in good faith offered
to give you the money with which you bought the cap, so is the money partly hers?
should you take the money to search out the old woman?
do you owe something to the thrift store, which would have sold the cap?
and what's the answer?
I don't know.
I know you're troubled.
I could clear our debts, clear my family's debts.
I could put my 2 daughters through college. I...
you know, I came by it unusually, yes, but not dishonestly.
and--and the book says

so you've been bargaining.
what about if I give so-and-so x dollars and so-and-so y?
is this too little, and am I being unfair?
is this too much? Am I being foolish?
but what is the answer?
you say you wish to share with your friends, but you cannot be certain that they, in the same situation, would share with you.
so I should keep all the money?
that's right.
keep all the money?
how can that be the right thing to do?
isn't that what your book says?
Oh, by the way, there's another book.
thank you for stopping by.
I said,"evacuate all the kids from the bus stop"!

Yes, sir.
Hey.
Mack thinks you're having an affair?
Yes.
and are you?
I never even kissed the man, I swear.
you can stay here till Mack comes home.
then you'll talk to him, face to face.
C.I.A.could use a man inside the unit.

let's get the hell out of here.
how's your mama, miss Molly?
she's doing fine, thanks.
that's a blessing.
how did you come to know my mother?
Oh, I remembered her from, uh, from when she visited here.
my mother hasn't been in Fort Griffith in 15 years, youo've been here that long?
now you've gone and caught me.
Hey! - What do you know about prison? Leavenworth causes that's where your husband and his buds are about to be shuffled off to.
what is it that you want? - To educate you.
your Jonas has done some things that are in his best interest when he came home, you tell him it's right he comes forward and confesses.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
you're about to.
mommy, mommy!
stop!
baby, you have got to pay attention!
I was just trying to help.
Ugh, they drive like crazy through here.
thank you so much.
Yeah. Just wish we could have gotten that maniac's license number.
you're like my daddy.
is that right? Well, I'm sure that he's quite a compliment.
he's brave, too.
well, I know he is, Sabrina.
how do you know my daughter's name?
I want to, uh, I want to help your husband, mrs. Brown.
actually, I want to help your whole family.
if you call that number when you get home, they will verify that I am what I say I am.
if you doubt the number, then you can get it through the yellow pages, ask for C.I.A. And ask to be put through to the C.I.A. Main switchboard, tell them agent katz.
what is this?
when you've made the call, I'll, uh, come to your house and explain it.
good-bye, mrs. Brown. It's about your husband.
Bye.

who the hell are you, and what do you think you're doing?
I said drop the bags and take 2 steps back. I'm not gonna say it again.
does your mama know you're out?
you should take your hands off your weapon unless you're ready to use it.
all right, everybody stop.
everyone, take your hands away from your weapons.
sergeant Strickland, I am sergeant major Blane. This is my compound.
you want to tell me what this is all about?
my orders state- sergeant Strickland, you may return to your patrol.
Yes, sir. Let's go.
Colonel bazemore, 30 minutes, I'll meet you at your office.
sergeant major...
this entire organization is on stand-down pending an article 32 investigation for massive criminal action and war crimes by members of this command.
sir, that's- - thank you, sergeant.
and it seems that this team, your team, sergeant major, is central to every aspect of those activities.
Colonel, I'm sure there's... --- In fact, at the present time, your men are the sole subjects of these potential criminal charges.
therefore, pending further notification, you will hold yourselves ready for interview by investigators from the C.I.D.
and I warn you now, that, if you speak about this matter among yourselves, under law, such action is considered conspiracy.
and under military law, conspiracy against command constitutes mutiny.
and, men, know you well that I will not hesitate to bring those charges against you myself.
this team, you five men, by your actions, may have destroyed a unit 30 years in the making.
now, you will walk away and you will leave this compound, and you will walk away in 5 different directions. You will have no further communications with each other.
you're dismissed.
Colonel, that was some show. You want to tell me who's behind the curtain?
I got hit with it first thing this morning.
all operations cease, unit close down.
senior team leader and his men are under investigation and the order letter was burn before reading.
that bazemore character?
washington hatchet man, bearer of bad news.
he brought the orders. He's overseeing the shutdown.
what's this all about?
I don't really know, but I do know that we're persona non grata.
nobody's taking my calls in washington D. C., nobody returns them.
all info comes through bazemore.
Colonel, do you believe for one second that I or my men are guilty of some crime?
I do believe that we're in the deep battle, and somebody wants us there.
I don't know yet who, and I don't know why.
I believe that they can bring us all down.
the men, you and me, everything that we've created is at risk.
I'm at a loss.
I'll let you know as best as I can what I know when I know it.
and I'll try to give you as much warning as I can, because when the army brings its full weight to bear against you, it's gonna be coming with a big crash.
we'll see you at 6: 00.
it's what I have to ask of you now.
no grocery store, emails, phone calls, messages, picking up mail.
garbage? We have to live our lives.
well, different lives, now.
assume you're being followed and phones are tapped, eyes and ears are on us all the time.
you've given years of service.
Yeah, well...I'm the red-headed stepchild now.
Why?
when the torturer comes, the last thing in the world you want to be is innocent, because you got nothing to confess.
and you know, baby, anything they accuse us of is beyond what we had done, or what we were charged to do...
we did not do.
in case.
you think I need that?
I sincerely hope not.
a good soldier always has plan "B.
because today is that rainy day.
who are you?
I'm from the agency, Bob.
what are you doing in my house?
he says the team's going to prison.
but it doesn't have to go that way.
the charges could focus solely on the misdeeds committed before you joined the unit.
who the hell do you think you are?
I'm the man who's bringing you a choice. I think I'm your friend.
your worm your way into my house, scare my wife with ghost stories, and you're my friend?
Bob, you've got a big decision to make here.
your wife plays a huge part in that.
I think- - Get the hell out my house!
Bob, he wants- - Get out now!
don't let a misplaced sense of loyalty bend your thinking.
a misplaced sense of loyalty?
the rest of your friends are gonna go to jail.
do you understand? You've gotta separate yourself from that.
we need you.
just get out of my house, all right?
company needs men like you.
Bob, I'm scared.
petition for dissolution of marriage's target has switched vehicles.
back trail's clear. Monitors are set.
if anybody approaches, we'll have plenty of warnings.
Where's Greg?
we might have had a tail.
Carlito couldn't shake him. Wouldn't meet him here.
I'll fill him in later.
well, then, let's proceed.
we may not have much time.
so what to do?
what the hell is this all about, anyway?
Iran? Missing diamonds, our mission in honduras?
it could be any one of a dozen things.
those were legitimate missions. We were following orders.
what orders are those?
you have copies of those orders?
there are no written orders.
we're at war.
has the whole world forgotten that?
why would anybody want to shut us down?
well, that's the question.
gentlemen, in the army, to be charged is to be convicted.
Oh, yes, and they will manufacture all the proof they need.
but there are records.
memorandums of record and Transcripts of the verbal mission order coming down from headquarters black ops.
first commander colonel Bartlett instituted it back in the seventies.
he was afraid someday something like this would happen, he'd get left twisting in the wind.
and so?
he kept a log of every conversation with H. Q.
every commander since has done the same.
is that so?
hand-written notes?
under military law, such a record stands as evidence.
Yeah, if it exists.
but where is it? The intel shop? The skiff?
no. Too many eyes.
it's in the safe of the commander's office.
I've been all over Ryan's office.
I've never seen a safe.
it's behind a plaque on the wall beside the old man's desk.
we plugged it in when we rebuilt the building.
I guess I'm the only one goes back that far.
miss Molly Anne?
you know, I can't stand the thought of a free ride, so I decided to pay some of the toll.
I dropped the girls off at that birthday party Bonnie's having for andrew.
you might want to go get them.
no, I just dropped them off.
there's trouble.
no, it's not Mack. He's not hurt.
I thought- - I know.
this is a different problem, and it's a bigger one than the troubles with
does Mack know where Wilson is?
I need your attention. - Is he trying to find him?
put that aside and listen to me.
I don't- - listen to me.
put your and Mack's troubles into your pocket, and belly up to the bar.
and you ain't gonna like it.
tell me.
nice day!
do I know you?
I'm an interested party.
is that right?
how'd you get on base?
a man could drive, he could walk.
let's see some I. D.Funny man.
now, see, the thing is, sergeant major Blane,
I don't need any I. D.
if that's your position...
6 pounds of pressure,
I'm through your skin into your black heart.
now who's behind this?
God!
Jonas, that's the guy.
you threatened my wife?
you got a question, you do not ask my wife.
you make a polite inquiry of me.
you've got 10 seconds.
where have you been?
I'm restricted to the base, not my house.
Where's the rest of your team?
got strict orders not to be with them, so I couldn't tell ya. Tick-tock, time's up.
I only answer to 2 things, fool ,my conscience and the army.
and my conscience says you and your posse are barking up the wrong military man.
and if you ever speak to my wife again, buy a bugle, and find a guy who can play taps.
you ain't taking my kids away.
we supposed to leave without them?
you are going to be with your boyfriend?
this Wilson fella, you can go without the kids, without your clothes.
Molly told me what's going on with the unit.
I thought we were gonna have to get out of here.
is that what you thought?
I was packing the girls and us to leave!
and go to him!
don't lie to me!
you're gonna divorce, you tell him!
is this where you did it?
or did he take you to his place?
this wasn't about Wilson!
our divorce isn't about your boyfriend?
it's about us!
you made it about him when you slept with him!
look at the date, you bully! I never filed it!
a year ago?
you were with him a year ago?!
I never slept with Wilson! - I saw you with him!
I didn't sleep with him!
who was it?
did you have a go with anyone to humiliate me?
who was it, Tiffy? Was it one of my buddies?
was it a stranger, somebody you picked up?
you self-important, self-righteous punk!
you want to know what's going on with- - I already know!
he talks to me and I like it! He listens to me and I like that.
he confides in me, and I know, end of the day, I won't get a call he's dead!
did I sleep with him? No. Did I want to? Absolutely.
where is he?
I sent him away because I knew you wouldn't understand no matter what I said.
no, you sent your--[Indistinct] Away.
that's right.
No!
you gonna hit me, Mack?
you gonna hit me?
is that all you know how to do? You can't charm it, you kill it!
tell me what happened!
tell me the truth!
get out of my way.
I'm more familiar with a gun than I am with your body.
I will shoot you.
I will give you one second to put that down before I take it from you.
ha ha, you're the big man now.
I'm leaving.
you are not leaving! We're gonna work this out.
and I'll tell anyone who will listen why my husband's a proud soldier but he's a poor excuse for a man!
he beats his wife!
people know me, Tiffy, no one's going to believe you.
you're a history man who kills for a living and a man who struck his wife. Everyone knows a few years back
you tell people whatever you want.
you explain this.
what did you do?!
Oh!
no, leave me alone! Leave me alone! Get out of my way!
where do you think you're going?
this is my unit.
gotta get something out of my locker.
place is off limits, buddy.
come on, guys. Only take a minute.
you can come with me.
ain't gonna happen, partner.
we got orders.
come on.
give a soldier a break, will you?
it's just us.
I'll tell you what, partner.
I'll call a patrol car, take you back to the barracks.
you don't need to be driving after drinking a few. I could do that for you.
come on, man.
OK, Jack, you had your chance.
and so did you.
post one needs assistance.
you better call 'em all.
come on, come on, come on. We don't want to make a career of this.
no numbers.
that's no help.
how is about that?
God help us all.
What'd you found out?
I found out this may go back to something that happened in portugal.
some mission in Portugal.
a friend of my friend is at the senator's office.
what are you doing?
thomas R. Ryan, P.O. Box 372, Tippit, Tennessee?
Hallandale, FLorida.
Switzerland. Greece.
these are eyes-only orders. Why haven't you handed these over?
you're not cooperating with them.
why aren't you cooperating?
because they're about to send my men to prison for serving their country.
you have a federal subpoena to hand over-- - that's immaterial.
you'd break a federal law? - That's right.
for your crew?
that's right.
and what is about our life?
Colin Selvin-- - who is he?
he's my friend at the senator's office.
Colin Selvin, all right.
he says you can save yourself, if you just...
I won't betray my men.
but you will give up all of the years you spent getting to where you are.
Tom, you can end up prosecuted with your men, perhaps jailed, humiliated, dishonorably discharged, can't get a job.
'what have you been doing for the past 20 years?" "Oh, I can't tell you."
you think I don't know that?
or, you can cooperate with whomever they direct you to in whatever way they ask you to, under the law, and then you are in a position to help your men, legally and correctly.
and what if legally won't work?
then... - I won't give up my men.
it's my fault. I did this to myself. I was so mad, I just...
stop protecting him. - I said I did this to myself.
you cut yourself? - That's right.
what the hell is going on in this place?
you see this?
what is happening to all of us?
leave him!
maybe she should.
but what do you advise she do afterward?
leave him now.
and get as far away from this place as humanly possible.
easy for you to tell Tiffy to just toss away her husband.
maybe she won't have to.
army looks like it's gonna do it for her.
ain't that right?
enter.
Colonel Ryan reporting as ordered.
Colonel Ryan, I've asked colonel Bazemore to be here as a witness.
Yes, sir.
allegations of severe misconduct, criminal conduct, have been brought against members of this command.
and either you knew of these activities and looked the other way, or you didn't know.
either which is culpable in a commander.
sir, may I speak? - Go ahead.
what are the charges? - Classified.
sir, 30 days, whatever the charges, share them with me sufficiently to allow me to refute them.
give me just 30 days, and I will do so to your satisfaction.
the first duty of a commander is to command.
Colonel Ryan, it is my considered belief that you have failed in that primary duty.
sir, this unit is the principal weapon in the terror fight, a unit which takes years to prepare, train and field.
if you want to bench me, fine.
but if you take those men out of the fight, you'll be handing a victory to our enemies.
it would be a mistake of the greatest consequence to this nation.
that's a decision that's been made in another place.
Colonel Ryan, I do, as of this instant, relieve you of the command of this organization.
you will consider yourself confined to quarters and under arrest.
that's all.
the league is ready to help any of you who need it.
we're still missing a couple of boys from roll call, Ron.
well, the desk sergeant said they're going to hold mr. Williams till Ryan comes to sign for him.
apparently, the old hector did a number of things.
Mm-hmm, providing cover for a failed mission.
what if they haul him off for interrogation?
no. He's in the drunk tank.
when I was at the station, I heard him singing hymns back there.
at least we know where he is.
it's grey that I'm worried about. Still no word from him?
what the hell happened to him?
if he's layin' low,there's a reason for it.
and if he's been grabbed, then he'll buy us some time.
if he's free, he'll lead them on a Merry Chase. Either-or, clock is running down.
Ryan's secret diary wasn't in the safe, so where is it?
he must have moved it. - Why ?
needs his own insurance.
and now what?
we have to decide.
do we go, or do we stay and fight?
whatever you choose, whichever way you go, the protective league will help you.
pay for lawyers, or if you go underground, support you and your families with cover and cash.
that's a rotten option for doing your job.
feeling sorry for ourselves ain't gonna make the donuts.
do we go? Do we stay?
each man has to decide for himself.
cause if you go to Leavenworth, can nobody do the time except you.
all right, boys.
if this is good-bye, it's been a hell of a ride.
and I thank you.
number 24.
sergeant major.
Yes. - Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.
that's quite all right.
I'd like to make a change in my pay status.
I'd like you to place everything except for $50 a month into an allotment for my wife.
sergeant major, it says here that your account's been frozen.
frozen?
flagged. There's an order placing a flag on your entire unit.
it says no favorable personnel action may be undertaken for any member of your command.
flagged, I can't believe it.
I got my kid going to college.
what do I do now?
look, sergeant major, what does "favorable personnel action" mean, anyway?
in my book, it means getting promoted, going to an army school, P.C. S.Ing, things like that.
but moving your own money around?
what's so favorable about that?
look, I don't want you to violate any rules address, account number.
it's done, sergeant major.
sergeant Rosas, that was...
as long as a soldier stays on duty status, the army can't touch an allotment, for any reason.
your wife will receive your pay no matter what.
one of the rare ones, sergeant Rosas.
have a great afternoon.
you, too. Thank you.
number 25.
you didn't see Tiffy.
well, I didn't see the bus that hit us coming, either.
but Tiffy left. With the kids. She's gone.
now grey's missing, too?
Mack's out chasing shadows, what's next?
don't touch that dial.
so? What do we do?
what do you want to do?
feel safe.
what?
don't we have to consider what the C. I.A. Is offering here?
for the kids' safety?
for us?
look, we stay, the pressure's gonna be a bitch, all right? A lot of scrutiny, hearings...
if they bring charges, that could mean prison.
if we stay, the unit might not ever be restored.
what happens-- - if I don't go to prison, another job here, a posting somewhere else...
another move.
if we go with the C.I.A. We're gonna be relocated anyway.
C.I.A.'S holding out a hand.
what are they offering?
safety.
are they?
well, it sure as hell doesn't feel safe here.
all right. I'll put teddy to bed.
OK, big boy. I got you.
sergeant Gerhardt.
and you are to be held in pretrial confinement in the post stockade until such time as you stand general court marshall for charges brought against you and your team.
but I could be convinced to mitigate the circumstances of your confinement under condition that you tell me the whereabouts of sergeant major Blane and sergeant grey.
have you nothing to say?
no, sir.
then you are dismissed.
do you no longer salute your superiors?
I surely do.
but in this room, I have no superiors.
and your teammates Blane and gray, you can certainly improve your own position, sergeant.
just tell me where they can be found.
I've been wondering that myself, Colonel.
what have you done with them?
stand at ease, sergeant.
due to a fortuitous mechanism that I'm not sure that youunderstand, you've been afforded the possibility of escaping the fate of your comrades.
you've been given a chance.
do you wish to tell me your decision?
sir, I'd like some more time
your decision, sergeant, before we leave this room.
sir, I can assure you, with the utmost sincerity, that I do not wish to go to prison.
did you give them what they wanted?
no.
I didn't give up everything I had in washington to watch some general step all over you.
and I didn't work my ass off all these years, hand on my heart, do the right thing, just to let anyone make me a traitor to my men.
so you aren't gonna fight for your career?
no.
you also have a marriage.
that's right.
I'm asking you, as your wife, simply to obey the law and to obey your superiors.
I can't do that.
if you can't fight for your career, then why should I fight for our marriage?
hang up that phone.
I will not.
I will make this call, and I will put out the fire.
I did what I needed to do, and it cost me my job.
and it cost you your wife.
you've reached tom and Charlotte Ryan. Please leave a message.
Tom, this is Molly.
there's blood on the...
I can't find...
Jonas is missing
taken!
where the hell is my husband?
this?
this isn't over. - It's over for you.
now you leave this woman alone.
you got anything else to take up with her, you go through me.
I'll go where I need to, when I need to, and I don't believe there's anything that says I gotta consult with you first.
it's a new rule.
it's a rule I just made.
I'll get some people in here to help you clean this up.
forget about the maids.
Where's my husband?
one good thing about disappearing as opposed to being awol is they can't bring charges.
missing is still a duty status.
until they find out who took him, Jonas' pay continues.
they can't charge him in absentia.
I'm so sorry for your trouble.
panama City

buenas tardes, senora.
something to drink... or perhaps something to play with?
a rum, please.
Hey, little chick, come here.
it's on the house, sir.
muchas gracias.
now Jonas is gone.
maybe killed.
what are we still doing here?
now, look, we don't know for sure what happened to Jonas.
you've been with the unit 2 years.
you gonna let yourself be punished for something the unit did before you signed on?
well, it happened a month ago, it happened 5 years ago.
you sign on to the unit, you're the unit.
you picked it up, you carry it.
it's a high price to pay for somebody else's crimes.
look, somebody in some conference room calls it a crime, doesn't make it a crime.
I can't betray my friends.
I can't.
what would that teach our children?
you know a better question, tell it to me.
gracias.
Gracias, marisol.
old friend.
Doyle.
the army's looking for your kidnappers.
they're already accusing the C. I.A. For your disappearance.
the C.I.A. Says the army has hidden you.
tell the others in the league I appreciate their help.
well, here's who you are.
Panamanian of west-indian descent.
hmm. Mother, father, family?
brother in prison, over in trinidad, gonna be there a couple more decades.
no wife, no other surviving family.
and the real alcibiades?
what's he up to these days?
went missing a few years ago.
anybody know what happened to him?
only me.
you'll pick up where the brother left off trader along the caribbean coast. From Colon to Bocas del toro.
huh. Where am i based out of?
village of beleM.
it's remote, but the alcalde there helps me in some other matters.
my boat?
Yeah, it's waiting for you in porto bello.
couple of reliable boys, my boys, onboard as first mate and deckhand.
certificate of incorporation, bank accounts...
the league paid the initial set-up costs for this, but it's a real business, Jonas.
we expect it to make a profit.
communications plans?
single-sideband radio in the boat, one-time pads.
never use the phone for contact.
the gringos listen to everything in panama.
if it's routine, use one of the dead drops.
if it's pressing, send one of the boys.
if it's an emergency, point the boat towards brazil and get underway.
cover your nakedness.
much appreciated.
and Jonas
yeah?
if they find you, they'll kill you.
that ain't exactly news.
done.
now that it's done, when can I get my wife and my children off base?
why the sad face?
it ain't one of my better days.
well, smile, soldier, bcause you ain't a soldier anymore.
you're in the majors now.
look, when can my family leave and where are we being sent?
you want to know the color of your new kitchen, too?
I should've known.
you'd think so, wouldn't you?
Mr. Brown, your first assignment.
no, first, my family needs to get settled.
we get relocated, you get my daughter into a new school, you get my wife a job and then...
you're on the clock now, mr. Brown.
you're on the inside, and your troubles are ours.
you give my man a list of your requirements and watch them performed.
what do you want from me?
we've misplaced someone.
we want you to find him asap.
get someone else.
no, this one's perfect for you. We need you and you're going out.
find the man.
all right, give me the background info. What's his name?
and what if I can't find him?
then it's off to prison with your mates.
I'm sick of this country, and I'm sick of the agency, and you could help me.
you should have shot me when you had the chance.
let's go. Run.
this entire organization is on stand-down, pending an article 32 investigation for massive criminal action and war crimes by members of this command.
this is good-bye. It's been a hell of a ride.
these are eyes-only . Dersor why haven't you handed these over, and why aren't you cooperating?
cause they're about to send my men to prison for serving their country.
what about our life?
the rest of your friends are gonna go to jail. Do you understand?
you've gotta separate yourself from that.
and you're C. I.A? - Yes. We've misplaced someone.
we want you to find him A. S.A. P.
what's his name? - Jonas blane.
hello. - It's agent kern. Where are you?
as discussed, I'm in toronto.
do you have him yet? Do you have jonas blane? Everyone at the agency is counting on you.
this is not kern. Who is this? How did you get this
sonora, mexico eighteen when i are i
Colonel, you are charged with commanding a group of rogue operators, men who are alleged to have betrayed this country, committed treason.
sir, I fail to see how my men doing their job makes them rogue operators.
your men were on an illegal mission to assassinate a foreign dignitary.
that mission was assigned.
by whom?
because I'm sure minister reale would like to know.
I'm sure his family would like to know, had you carried out his assassination, who assigned you the mission.
my direct superiors.
congressman, if I may interject
I have no knowledge of this mission.
Colonel ryan believes that he and his men are above the law.
2 weeks ago, a pair of his men went awol
Blane is not awol. He's missing
Ryan, what he's doing here is breeding renegades, his whole damn
Colonel, you sent alpha team on a prisoner rendition to malaysia last april.
you recall this mission?
no, sir, I surely do not.
this mission never took place.
those are the specifics right in front of you
and they've been completely fabricated.
Colonel
I am and have been a loyal member of the army.
I have every mission order the unit has ever received, and I can assure you that my men were not in malaysia last april.
do you have this proof available now to the committee?
not at this moment, but I can produce it.
then you will have 24 hours to do so.
Mr. Reale, we'll hear your testimony tomorrow, then.
I'm happy to amend my schedule.
you sent a man to kill me in my home.
Colonel ryan.
general heath's in duck-and-cover mode.
Yes, sir.
tomorrow reale will testify that sergeant jonas blane tried to kill him.
as part of a direct order.
if you don't have proof of that mission order, sergeant blane's done.
you and your unit are done, too.
things can't get any worse.
things can always get worse.
but as long as you're healthy, you can live your life in leisure and let your wife support you.
my wife? - Yeah.
her assignment in london.
I meant to congratulate you and charlotte.
Charlotte and i have separated.
Really? I'm sorry to hear that.
what assignment? What assignment?
Belen panama panama city, panama eaton, missouri who killed minsiter?
damn it, where are you?
run
What're you doing down here, bob?
lookin' for jonas.
well, it seems you found him.
now, what are we gonna do about you?
welcome to panama, bob.
listen-- - no, you listen.
I know why you're free.
you cut some deal with the brass, sell the rest of the team down the river to save your own ass?
is that right, young sergeant?
he had a rifle on you.
I had a scope on you.
scope attached to the rifle?
check the bag.
any binoculars?
nothin'.
know what they used to do, they suspect a woman was a witch?
What'd they do, top?
tied an anvil to her, threw her in a pond.
and...
if she sank, she was not guilty.
put that in your mouth.
just do it.
you come here to kill me?
spit it out.
top, I... - no. You pass.
it's good to see you.
how's dirt diver and hammerhead?
still in the post stockade. No word on when they'll be out.
did you know reale's dead?
blew up his car 2 miles from capitol hill.
american media's all but buried the story.
who has that kind of juice?
big oil, big politics-- take your pick.
it's connected to why they shut us down.
we've been trying to work it all out.
well, how can I help?
we don't have a command, but we still got a mission.
what are these, P. O.Box addresses?
list is from ryan.
he mailed copies of our mission orders to these addresses.
it's the unit's only defense now.
go with carlito.
pick up the one in santiago.
no, no, I'll take it on my own.
then use him as your back-up.
price for guessing wrong is high, top.
no, I ain't guessin'.
ancient chinese lie detector.
man's lyin', ain't got any spit, can't spit out the rice.
off you go.
panama city, panama
you shouldn't have come here.
I need mariana's address.
you don't have time to play detective.
take the boat. Get the hell outta here.
find some far corner of this earth and hide in some cave, because the world is about to come crashing down.
is that your plan?
soon as I wrap up some loose ends, I'm outta here.
one address. I know you have it.
don't do this.
you stick your head up, you're committing suicide.
you don't think I know that?
she's my only contact to reale, and whoever blew him up is also responsible for shutting down the unit.
there you go. I can't help you anymore.
stay safe.
you, too, brother.
ain't a way to treat a man you took a shower with.
some things don't wash off.
what do you want?
who blew up reale in his car?
I would've put money on you.
Hey, you tried to kill him, too.
what do you want?
what's the C. I.A. Angle?
all I know is I was your cover. That's it.
if that were true, you wouldn't be packing now.
I can't help you, rohan-- oh, I mean jonas.
but maybe your real wife can.
I don't happen to have a wife or a family right now, and I'd like to know why.
how should I know?
because you're absolutely terrified.
What're you scared of, and why the hell were you on that mission?
building there's
go!
this way!
you've been hit.
is that what that is?
sergeant grey, I have orders to take
hey
where the hell were you? You didn't see those guys?
what guys? - C. I.A. N. S.A. I don't care.
they were waiting for me.
no one went in. They must've been waiting inside.
Yeah, how'd they know I was there? You send them?
no, ryan must've sent them. The orders weren't there?
nothin' but an empty box. All I found was a gun in my face.
how are we gonna warn the boss?
what the hell did you give them?
did you come here to threaten me?
actually, I came here to see my lovely wife and to ask her, a--who she slept with; b--what secrets she sold; or c
which combination of the above led to her new highly coveted diplomatic post in london.
who I've slept with? - That's right.
some of us actually take our vows seriously.
got the answer to one question.
so the only other question is what secrets did you sell?
how long have you been anglin' for this job?
please, I was working in washington for years before I met you.
did it ever occur to you that I got this job because I have the right credentials?
sure, but then I'd ask why now?
I was chosen for the job.
why now?
because that's when I was chosen.
in the last year, as my wife, you've had access to information about the unit.
the unit's going down in flames, and your career is thriving.
the rooster crows. The sun comes up. He didn't cause it.
did you sell the unit out?
did you sell the unit out?
how many times did I warn those women not to trust anyone?
did I bring a spy into my own house?
you wouldn't take the reins of your career. I had to.
you have no idea what you've done.
Oh, really, tom.
I hardly think your unit holds a corner in decency and honor.
then why is this happening?
it's happening because somebody believes your people know too much.
about what?
about what?
all right, then.
I'll get my answers soon enough when I get those mission reports back.
you had those mission orders intercepted, didn't you?
they never left the main post office.
you're gonna get me court-martialed.
there is a different world you were so close to.
there's about 6 families who run this country, tom, from the very beginning, the same 6 families.
they intermarry, and occasionally they hire outsiders to look after their interests.
occasionally they take in outsiders, tom, who didn't go to yale or choate, who don't summer at mount desert, but who show such great promise that they are invited in, as you were, tom.
you cannot imagine what was in store for you.
but you have to choose.
it is insufficient to say, "I don't get it." Yes, you do get it.
I loved you, and I love you...
but you have to choose.
they're kicking us off the base already?
no. Uh...
what?
bad joke. - Right.
what's goin' on?
Oh, I'm just goin' home to texas for a visit.
well, looks more like you're moving camp.
honey, if it's about being scared, I assure you the people on the base, the unit, will understand your problems better than anyone.
I'm not scared. I'm going to texas.
no one would blame you if you were worried about bob.
thank you.
have you heard from him? - No.
I'm taking the kids to see their grandparents. That's all.
I have to pick up serena at day care.
take off your shirt.
bullet went through.
is there a safe place we can spend the night?
I'm going to the airport
you wanna get us caught?
all public terminals are off-limits now.
hold on there.
I'd like a little skin over the bone.
thank you.
was that man after you or me?
I have no idea.
enough lies.
someone's trying to kill us all off.
tell me why.
why should I know?
this has something to do with reale.
I know nothing about this.
let go of me.
I didn't think we'd ever meet again.
you don't sound too disappointed.
just stating a fact.
fate has its own plans.
I suppose so.
but in another universe...
not this one?
this one has different rules.
could I talk to my nephew in private?
no private conversations with this prisoner, ma'am.
it's all right.
how's my uncle doing?
still on his trip.
we haven't spoken in a couple of days. We were talking by radio, but the nice old man who was helping him was taken sick yesterday.
did uncle james have any answers?
no.
but next time they question you, see if you can find out if they know about this.
if they do, they're responsible.
I was woinnderg if you'd come.
Yeah, well, I wanted to see how you are.
for the sake of the kids, I'm willing to put our differences on hold.
that's fine, but I don't care.
tell molly that I'm good.
tell her that I'm strong and fit.
tell molly?
just tell her that I'm strong and fit. Can you do that?
is that it? - That's it.
is that all you have to say to me?
don't you want to know how the girls are doing?
I assume they're all right.
what's wrong with you? Have you lost your mind?
if I had, how would I know?
did you sign the divorce petition yet? - No.
would you do that, please?
OK, I must be the one who's crazy, because I thought we could actually save our marriage. I'll file it.
message ends.
tiffy, tiffy, tiffy lou love my rifle more than you used to be my beauty queen now I love my m16
Mack says he's strong and fit.
means mack wants me to tell hector to be strong, don't give up anything.
well, that's all he said.
he was cold?
he was more than cold.
honey, he's just trying to protect you.
you know he's being interrogated.
by pretending he doesn't care, no one can use his family against him.
no.
you didn't see the hatred in his eyes. No, it's over.
don't be hasty. Wait awhile.
Why? - Because it's not just about you two.
Oh, so I should stand by my man for the sake of the unit?
so now you don't care anything about the unit?
no, I don't give a damn about the unit.
excuse me.
who was jonas
I need to speak with kern.
agent kern is not available, but I can help you.
who else did you send after sergeant blane?
some folks were growing impatient, bob. They thought more resources were needed.
double redundancy in case I fail?
you know the drill. I tried to tell you, but you seem to have lost your phone.
where are you now? - Vancouver. Look, I need
I need the address of one of your operatives, mariana ribera.
panama city
she's far from vancouver, bob.
I could give you her address, but our other man was just there.
he notified us as to her whereabouts, as well as jonas'.
look, you're trying to kill jonas. Kern promised I could bring him back alive.
you had 2 weeks.
give me one more day. Call your men off.
can't do it, bob.
but I can forward mariana's address to your location in panama city.
maybe you can pick up the trail and bring in your man before anyone else gets to him.
tell me how many men you sent after jo-- ?
e's a C. I.A. Safe housenorth of bogot.
an old friend runs it.
can't trust him.
you can trust him.
he's in love with me.
but you don't want to surprise him.
he'll put a bullet through both of us before we knock on the door.
Red-7-2-4, this is green-1-9-8.
the code word for the day is goldenrod.
George, hey. I have some exciting information. I'm headed your way.
thank you.
he said stay off route 2. There's a police blockade.
I need to ask you a favor.
what?
things go badly for me, would you take my wedding ring and send it to my wife?
Why?
well, I won't need it anymore.
the agency sent me on that mission with you to steal something from reale's safe.
something?
a document.
he was using it to blackmail the government.
what is it?
I don't know, a map of some sort. I couldn't make sense of it.
but they said that it was critical that I obtain it.
and did you? - Yes, I did.
but I told the agency that I failed.
Why?
an insurance policy in case they ever cut me loose.
someone found out that I lied.
where is the document?
at a bank in dallas, texas, in a safe-deposit box.
but they think that you have it.
and why would they thinkha tt?
because I told them so.
great.
no, jonas would avoid public transportation.
you think? What about the C. I.A. Hit man?
how do you know he's C. I.A.
what?
you just said the assassin's C. I.A.
I'm working for them.
I got a family.
a man cannot serve 2 masters. - I got it under control.
agent vorhees, this is bob brown.
I had sergeant blane till one of your resources got in the way.
I know where he's headed next.
I understand. Where will he be?
what do you understand?
stay out of your way.
Juanchito bus terminal. The 8: 00 for medell.
the 8: 00 to medell?
they'll tell their man jonas is here. All we have to do is sit and wait.
your team obviously had an exfil plan for when things went south.
where would sergeant blane go to lay up?
you know, you keep asking me that, and I just can't seem to find an answer.
maybe it's because you haven't had a good night's sleep.
ain't that the truth.
you'd think people would know better than to bring their crying babies into prison.
if I could fix that for you?
wouldn't matter.
on your mission last year in san tomas, did you meet a C. I.A. Agent named, uh, mariana ribera?
one meets so many people.
I'm gonna give you one last chance to cooperate.
at the conclusion of the mission, mariana ribera gave jonas blane something.
where is it?
sir, my proof was stolen by the ringmasters of this circus.
you're trying my patience, colonel.
would you like to know what happened to minister reale yesterday?
I know what happened.
you know who killed minister reale in broad daylight on the streets of our capitol?
Jonas blane.
they're from building security cameras.
they were taken 35 minutes before the explosion.
that's not possible. - Why not?
your man's a trained killer, quite well versed in the use of explosives, isn't he?
if he were free to move about, why would he stay in this country?
these photos were doctored.
the oil minister was set to testify against jonas blane today.
I would say the person with the strongest motive for his murder is jonas blane.
tell us where he is.
I swear I do not know.
Colonel, you have 2 options:
a court-martial or the free pass that uncle sam is offering you.
it has a sell-by date.
I never expected this to happen.
I thought that the unit was impenetrable.
I thought if I told them that the document was with you, that I'd be safe.
nothing's impenetrable.
everything can be breached.
I know, and I'm sorry. I--I never meant to put you in harm's way.
george has a refrigeration truck with a hidden compartment.
he can get us across the border to venezuela.
then we'll go get this document.
who has access to the safe-deposit box?
only me. I have to be there in person with my I. D.And the key.
Jonas. - Yeah.
when you get the document, you'll leave...
and they're gonna find me and kill me.
no. I won't let that happen.
I'm a lucky lady, then.
how's that?
cause I believe in you.
George! Oh, my god.
Overton global services. How may I help you?
this is red-7-2-4.
the code of the day is goldenrod.
go ahead, 7-2-4.
Jonas blane and mariana ribero are dead. I request transport instructions.
hold one.
use flynn air charter, mariquita airfield. 3 hours.
thank you.
Hey. Anything?
not yet.
so if this C. I.A. Assassin was sent here to kill jonas, why should I believe you're any different, bob?
I mean, I never bought the whole "good-looking, earnest boy scout" thing.
guy like you, with all your advantages, wants to be out here with the shooters, out in the mud, deep down, you're seriously screwed up.
deep down.
or you have a hidden agenda.
well, maybe I just like shootin' guns.
well, then you'd go hunt on the weekends.
you like people shooting back.
hello.
Jonas blane is dead.
he's been flown to addison airfield in dallas.
go I. D.The body. - Will do.
who was that?
my handler.
Jonas is dead.
we'll hold the remains until notified.
Yeah. Just flew into town.
welcome home, mr. Krutoff.
you know I wouldn't ask if there was any other choice.
good.
12 noon. I'll see you there.
how did you know I was in texas?
you're scared.
people have patterns.
such as?
Molly's been through some tough times.
she'd stay put and wait for me.
you, on the other hand...
what about me?
you're a young wife with 2 small kids.
if something happened to bob, you'd seek the comfort of home.
if something didn't happen to bob, if, for example, he's being protected by the C. I.A.
you'd be uncomfortable with prying questions and want to escape.
either way...
and he's still alive?
last I saw him.
we all thought you were kidnapped.
well, let's keep it that way.
nobody can know about this meeting, kim, not even my wife.
all right.
now, I'm not gonna pretend that the task I need you for...
is a walk in the park.
just tell me what you need me to do.
I heard from your cousin.
he wants you to know he's doing just fine.
he's strong and fit, hopes that you are, too.
in fact-- - stop.
Molly, they told me jonas is dead.
who did? - My interrogators.
you can't believe them. They'll tell you anything.
they had details, molly.
he was hiding on a boat in panama.
they caught up with him at a C. I.A. Safe house. Guard!
this woman isn't my aunt.
she's been trying to pass me messages.
he's confused. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
just please take her away. - It's from the stress.
I want to talk to supervisor marsh.
ma'am, step back. - I can't do this anymore.
I'm done.
I'm ready to cooperate fully.
why the change of heart?
I don't wanna die in prison or on the run like jonas did.
tell me about the mission in san tomas.
not here. Take me to D. C.
let me see the faces of the people who can guarantee my safety, and I'll tell them whatever you want.
ma'am, who did you say you were here to see?
my husband, mack gerhardt.
I'm sorry, but I have no prisoner listing under that name.
when was he transferred?
ma'am, no one under that name has ever been here.
that's ridiculous. I just saw him yesterday. It's g-e-r-h-a-r-d-T.
and your name is?
and you say you were here yesterday?
no, i was here yesterday.
I have no record of your visit or your husband ever being incarcerated here.
now I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
what do I do when I get inside the bank?
stay calm and don't look around.
act like you've been there a dozen times before.
show them the key. Ask for your safe-deposit box. Get in and get out.
this is mariana.
very good. Just relax. Everything'll be fine.
lone star reality 'Scuse me, sir.
you a local resident?
no, sir, but I hope to be.
a jewelry store was robbed recently.
you mind if I see some I. D?
well, my face is gonna be just as black on my I. D.
sir, the suspect is n-ricaafamerican.
well, I must look exactly like him.
your I. D. Sir.
uh, don't have a license with me. I just flew in on business.
please don't move, sir.
sir, stop where you are.
turn around.
scream for help. Scream for help.
help! Help! Help! Someone!
help!
tell molly, "to lose thee were to lose myself.
my mother was always the nicest person I ever knew.
she was the nicest, sweetest woman than anyone who knew her ever knew.
then things changed...
then she changed.
she got angry. Good and angry.
anger has turned my mother into a very sad and bitter woman.
if she wasn't my mother, I'd slap her.
I would.
I'd look her straight in the face and tell her what I really think of her...
and then I'd run really fast in the opposite direction.
are you eating? - Yes.
I want you eating. I mean it.
okay.
you ladies are old enough now, I'm not gonna pull any punches here.
he took his wallet...
and he left.
when he didn't come home the other night, you know, I thought we got lucky and he was just in a car crash, dead by the side of the road, but the fact is, he's run off with his little Swedish secretary, who, oh, what a coincidence, mysteriously left work three days ago and moved back to Sweden!
but where did he go? Have you spoken to him?
no, I haven't spoken to him.
there is very little to say.
he knows that. But I did cut off all his god damn credit cards.
closed his checking account, yeah.
see how long she sticks around when he's broke.
your father is a...
small man.
very small.
I hope that's not an allusion to the man's genitals - 'cause that'd just be gross. - Aw, dude, - I was about to eat a string bean. - Oh, my god
excuse me, excuse me. Everything is not a joke.
I am talking.
and as a jittery nation worries about a counterstrike, we'll go to the scene of the anthrax scare in Florida.
Sheesh.
Hey. Hey, Terry.
what do you want?
well, I-I...
I wanted to talk to you and Grey about them building that subdivision back there?
yeah? - He's so, um
he's so damned set against it, he hasn't even heard the proposal.
grey doesn't live here anymore, Denny.
he doesn't exist.
go away.
officials tell us that they are worried about how to manage the fragile US-led coalition in the days ahead, but the facts are already evident from south Asia, to Africa, to the Middle East.
worldwide, thousands of angry demonstrators are taking to the streets to protest US military
the least he could have done was taken this stupid jock with him.
there have been plenty of protests in the world.
and I suspect...
Ugh.
what-- what
what do you mean, " He doesn't exist " ?
Oh.
are you stoned?
Yeah. - Oh... Jesus.
what do you-- what do you mean, "He-- he doesn't exist"?
he's been messing around with his assistant.
go talk about it on the radio.
no, I'm-- I'm-- no, I'm-I'm-- I'm-I'm be
I'm being serious. I need-- I need to talk to him.
um...
he left me.
he left you? - Mm. For Danken Shane or whatever his secretary's name is, so Denny you can go ahead and build your...
damn subdivision back there
I don't know, whatever it is you want.
it was him who had the problem with it, not me, okay?
he left you? - Yes.
Really? - Yeah.
Hey, I'm sorry, Terry.
you know, go ahead and build your houses back there, Denny.
he's gone. He won't stop-- - They're not my houses.
they're not. I'm just, um
I'm just the front man, you know, wave the World Series ring.
they get the sales, I'm getting a free lot out of it.
Ooh, a free lot.
hmm. - It's something Shep set up.
he really left? Really?
this is... true?
Yeah.
Hey, come on. Just go away.
Hey. Well-- ah-- look, let me come in.
come on, if yo-- if you don't want, I won't talk. I'll just sit there and I'll drink with you.
there was a large mob...
of angry demonstrators here today, proving that a number of people are willing to go and fight.
the feeling is that-- - I got her to school.
thank you.
you know I'm going back to school in the morning, you're gonna get her yourseIf tomorrow.
Billy Edwards on my bus says that when you get really drunk, you get friendly and you sign baseballs without bitching about it.
he does? - Yeah.
so, you got any baseballs around?
no.
why don't you run down the street to my house.
I got a...
stack of boxes in my garage. There's a key under my mat.
you grab one of those boxes. You bring it back here.
one box.
anything she makes...
I'm gonna split with her.
buddy, God damn you! Out!
what's the big deal? He wasn't licking it more than three seconds.
the three second thing is for floors, not dogs' mouths.
he spends all day licking other dogs' asses.
Oh, let's just call for take-out.
it's fine. You guys, it's good chicken. It's fine.
like you'd eat it?
it's fine.
you know the Zilwaukees' Great Dane, "Mo'fo"?
you're licking his asshole right now.
you know what, that's really sick.
how's dinner coming?
good. We made your favorite.
chicken. - Thank you.
um, can you make an extra plate? Denny's staying for dinner.
that was quick.
what was quick?
what was quick?
please...
give me more credit than that, Hadley. He's a drunk.
you make a nice couple.
my life is falling apart at this moment.
I expect some compassion from you.
now you go back up to schooI tomorrow, come back home at Christmas break and bust my hump if you want to, but right this minute, I want the benefit of the doubt at every turn!
are we clear?
Yes.
thank you.
mm, this looks good.
what kind of a dick-head runs away with his secretary?
that is lame. Take a right, make a left at pathetic.
I think he's coming back home.
maybe not soon, but... I do.
I think we should call him.
and say what?
"hey Dad, how's your new life going so far?
I got an A in interpretive dance."
he doesn't care about you, Emily. Get real.
he lost his job, Hadley.
what? - Your father was about to be laid off.
he was told a few months ago.
he was devastated. He didn't want you girls to know it.
okay? I think he flipped out or something.
I read this article on the internet. Apparently, it's common.
they lose their jobs, and they go nuts.
what do you want from me?
it's the best that I can come up with.
I don't want anything from you.
well, don't take it out on me, Hadley. You aren't gonna have to be here.
you aren't gonna know how empty this house is gonna be.
well, if it makes you feel any better, I hate him too.
Oh, does that mean you hate me?
you are such a mental.
I have to go, okay?
all right.
I'll see you later, okay?
Hey.
listen to my show today, okay?
I'll mention you.
I'm gonna bring you up as a drinking buddy - I watched the invasion with. - I don't want you to do that, Denny.
I know, but. you don't have a choice.
Yeah, I do. I don't want to be mentioned on the radio.
you don't want to be mentioned?
she cried more, more, more! - No.
she cried more, more, more! - Okay.
Oh God.
Hey, come on! Slow down!
there's children playing here! - Sorry, sorry, sorry!
there's children playing here! - Sorry!
and now, once again,
detroit's own legendary Denny Davies.
okay, it's the Denny Davies show.
and if you're a regular listener, and you've just tuned in, you know that you haven't missed much.
and you know that's the beauty of the show, right, Shep?
you can always just jump right in here with us - because-- - Because nothing ever happens.
nothing ever happens, exactly
now what were we talking about just before the commercial?
Oh yeah. The invasion, right?
see? - Right?
you still do have your memory. - Yeah.
I know what people are saying. Were you watching TV?
as a matter of fact, I was watching it with my drinking buddy the very sweet, the very tall and absolutely sexy.
but you-- but you know what?
what? - She doesn't want me to talk about her, so I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna talk about her.
not gonna talk about who?
I get it. We're not even mentioning Terry Ann WoIfmeyer's name.
Nope. - ls that the game that you're playing?
not even gonna bring her up. - Terry Ann WoIfmeyer.
you're getting no play. - On 101 WRIf Detroit.
you're listening to the Denny Davies show.
what I don't get, is how come you won't talk about baseball?
with all they pay you every year, what's with you not talking about base
Hey, guess what, guess what, pinhead?
they don't pay me that much.
he just got flushed.
okay, that's...
that's it for me folks, the Poobah's up next,
big Daddy Arthur P.
but I'll be with you tomorrow, and you can all call in give me hell, the radio equivalent of dunking the clown...
into the water.
WRIf Detroit at 5: 00.
that wasn't too bad, was it, Shep?
wasn't too... vicious?
no, you were mild today. You probably only lost about 6 or 7, 000 listeners.
you should feel really good about yourseIf.
Hey, but what was all that about?
all what? - That whole thing about the woman you watched the invasion with? Who's she?
just a girl.
Yeah, she's one of the 20-year-olds, isn't she?
from the college thing. The one I got you.
no.
no, she's not 20. She's nowhere near 20.
ln fact, look, don't superimpose your warped thinking onto my life, okay?
I got enough problems.
okay, well, then while we're at it, don't knock my dating habits, okay?
cause they keep me young.
I happen to be a walking encyclopedia of every boy-band that ever existed.
trust me, you don't get that from dating Arianna Huffington.
did you, uh, find out about that, uh, mall opening in Toledo?
what it's price was? - Yeah, $10, 000.
$10, 000 for you to show up for one-haIf an hour.
you know, it must suck for you... - You're going.
...not, uh, being me. - Yeah, almost as much as it must suck - actually being you. - And now, your Rock 'n' Roll - radio chaperone of Detroit-- - Go home.
seriously. I've got a reaI disc jockey to produce.
my impression of you in about 15 minutes.
that was said with love.
Where's Mom?
she's upstairs taking a shower.
what are you working on?
what are you looking in the want-ads for?
a job.
I need to work. I'm not going to college.
okay.
it's okay with me, I guess.
thank you.
what are you gonna do? - I want to be a reporter.
a newscaster. - Well, you have the face for it.
Oh. Are you staying for dinner?
depends.
if you're making any more of that chicken, I am.
here you go.
a little something to get you into second gear.
what are you doing?
I wasn't looking, relax.
get out! Jesus!
I get out, I'm taking this drink with me.
have you ever heard of boundaries?
okay, that's it.
I'm drinking them both.
give me the drink.
l-I wasn't looking.
all right? l, uh...
I didn't see much.
all right, well... what are you doing here?
what do you want? - Well, little Emily invited me...
for dinner.
she did? - Yes, she did, and I think you know my position on free food.
which one of you recites Brownie?
come on, your mother told me once that one of you recites Brownie, beautifully.
Oh. Browning,
Elizabeth Barrett Browning and I was telling you that...
um... Popeye, a few years back when you were like, I don't know, nine or 10 or so.
I had her read Browning and she used to commit some of the poems to memory and recite them here at the dinner table.
that's right.
that's what it was. That sounds
that sounds good.
I've never heard anything like it before but it-- it sounds fun.
to who?
to all of us, if she can remember.
can we do this tomorrow night when I've had notice and can make plans to eat somewhere else?
I don't remember any of them anyway.
I do.
you do? - Yeah.
Really? Wow.
I'm impressed.
good. You should be.
what's so funny?
nothing. Just
you're just all-- I don't know...
very female.
I got her number in Sweden... from Helen Trailer.
it forwards and l...
called last night.
it must've been the middle of the night there.
it was Grey that answered. I'm sure of it.
Yeah. I hung up like a six-year-old.
Ah, he'll marry her. I'd bet any money in the world.
what do you think you'll do?
eh, what can I do?
well, you're set up, right?
right?
I mean Grey's got to be pretty chunky in the money department, - plus, you have-- - I have, what?
bills? Responsibilities?
four girls? One that hates me, two or three that are leaning that way.
you can have your damn lots back there, Denny.
I'm not here for the lots.
then leave.
any other reason than that for you to be here, frankly, is just pitiful.
are you okay? - No.
I'm a wreck.
she's gonna take us to school.
you see women...
on TV, in the movies, and they get left or whatever.
you just wanna kick 'em, they're so whiny.
look at me.
I hate his guts. I hate his guts for what he's done.
Oh.
he's a pig, your dad.
just a vile, selfish, horrible pig, but you know what?
I'm not gonna trash him to you girls.
I'm not.
I hate him too.
I hate him so much.
I know you do, baby.
you're human. How could you not?
all right. See you. - For the the last...
Hey, hey, wait.
who is that?
he's cute.
that's Gorden Reiner. He's new.
he's from Chicago.
go meet him. - Yeah.
I met him. He's not interested in me.
all he likes to talk about is bungee jumping.
tell him you're from a broken home.
I'm serious. - Should I?
guys think things like that are great.
trust me. I'm gonna use it.
Hi, Gorden.
Hey.
did you know I'm from a broken home?
okay, bye.
turn it down.
Wolfmeyer residence - Hey, beautiful.
it's Denny.
which one is this? - It's Andy.
bingo. You still lookin' for work?
I am. - Well, I want you to come in tomorrow.
and see Shep Goodman from my show.
he needs a production assistant.
Denny, you're kidding me.
you're amazing. - Yeah...
well, you tell that to your mom, we're even.
so you come in tomorrow, okay? I'll set you two up.
okay! Thank you so much!
Oh my God.
I might get a job working on Denny's show.
are you kidding me? - No!
that would be amazing! - That would be so cool.
Oh my God. - What's up?
Denny just called. She might get a job on his show.
Oh, really? Denny just called here?
Yeah, I have an interview tomorrow for a job.
wait, wait. What about school?
I want a job.
I'm not going to college.
wha-- you're not going to college?
no, I told Daddy and he wanted me to wait to tell you, but now
Oh, but now that he's off screwing his assistant, you think you can safely drop the bomb on me, is that it?
no.
"no" is right. You are going to college!
you know damn well how I feel about this.
all four of you. You're all goddamn going to college!
I don't have a job open.
it's that simple, Denny. It's cut and dry.
this girI has something.
she does, Sheppy, she's sharp.
she has class.
you could be hiring the next, um... Diane Sawyer.
I don't have a job open.
I know you don't, but you could do this for me, right? You could do this for me.
no, I can't. Wanna know why?
Yes, why? - Okay, I'm gonna come in there.
I'm gonna tell you. Hold on.
Jesus.
I'm going on in a second here.
because, my lord, I'm too busy doing other things for you.
'my lord " ?
a life that won't - Hi.
bring me down - Um, I'm Andy Wolfmeyer, I'm here to see Shep Goodman about a job.
um... Denny Davies asked me to come in.
Oh, okay. Well, if you'd like to take a seat over there.
I'll let him know you're here. - Okay, thank you.
no, you're not understanding me, - You're making this really-- - I found one!
I've got an opening. Something's come up.
I found an opening.
I'm on the phone. - Okay.
if you want her to have the job, I'll make it happen.
you'll just owe me, as usual.
I got the job.
what job?
with Denny, as a production assistant.
Yes, what?
are you looking to get laid?
is-- is this what's going on?
I mean, are-are you looking for another notch in your belt, or-- I don't know
whatever it is you super sports heroes call it.
I mean are you looking to get lucky with me
to get me into bed? - Uh, who's calling?
be straight with me, Denny.
be straight. Now, Grey always thought you had an eye for me, and I need you to be really straight with me now.
uh, okay. Um...
I do like you.
I always have. Um...
you wanna have sex with me. ls that it?
No! Uh, no, I mean
um... well, uh...
Yeah, if you're offering, I guess.
okay then.
I'll be right there. Give me 10 minutes.
uh, ex-- excuse me? - Give me 10 minutes.
I'm not gonna do much with my face, though, so don't expect much.
ln fact, keep the drapes shut.
I don't like a lot of light. It's not very light in there, is it?
no, there, uh
there's not a lot of light here.
okay, well, have a drink.
have a couple.
I don't want you to have a real clear memory of this when it's over, okay? I'll see you soon.
slow down!
slow down! - Oh, please. Come on.
there's children playing here! - Ah, get over yourself!
there's children playing here!
Hello?
I'm here!
uh, Denny?
I'm coming up!
Hello?
it's me.
listen, um, something came up.
I had a, uh-- I had a call.
they needed me right away over at the station.
Shep's in some kind of trouble. - Oh, yeah.
you are so full of shit. - I'm not.
no, I'm not. - Yes, you are.
I'm not and...
in fact, I'd like a rain check.
it's not gonna happen.
this was like... Halley's Comet.
it's not coming around again for 57 years.
what the fuck is Halley's Comet?
but this is the main production booth
this is where you and I will be doing a lot of working.
okay. - Here, come on, I'll show you this.
this is the live on-air studio. Arthur?
say hello to my new assistant Andy Wolfmeyer.
Hello, Andy. - This is Arthur Pennhallow.
he's a big deal here in town. - Yeah.
we're friends. He idolizes me, actually.
the fuck I do.
he does. - Okay.
that was a joke. We're tight, and we're good friends.
okay.
so what is " Andy " short for? " Andrea? "
Yeah, "Andrea." - Cool. See? I'm good with names.
Yeah.
okay, I'll show you up at the office now, - where we work a lot up there, too. - Okay.
have you seen an Emmy in person?
you've won an Emmy? - Couple.
local, but who's counting? Actually, I have three.
there's only two up there, 'cause one I keep for the hoteI room when I travel.
Wow.
kids, hurry up! You're gonna be late!
how's your lunch, Gordon? - It's good.
did you ever see that documentary on the Chicago Seven?
what about the one
the one about the Kent State killings?
no. - Something like...
six people were killed by the cops, there was all this turmoil and it got really ugly and just opened up a lot of old wounds between the police and the people of the area.
I'm from a broken home also.
you are?
Hey, do you bungee jump?
no. - Well, I do.
I go up with my dad.
we drive up north to Fenton Valley...
and bungee jump off this huge crane. - That sounds exciting.
well, I read your letter.
was it too mean?
I don't want it to be mean.
well, I mean I do, but I don't.
well, he's your father and he's...
left you at a very tough time.
I know and I want him to know that it pisses me off he hasn't called.
Oh, he knows.
he's not talking to his brother or his friends at work.
he knows what he's done.
are you gonna call him?
please?
this is stupid. It's just a stupid game.
you said you have his number.
this letter is good. I mean, it's good for you to get your feelings out.
um...
I want you eating, though.
you are dancing so much.
do you think maybe it's too much?
I know you have this out here. Daddy built it for you, - but you spend so much time out here. - You're such a head case.
what? - Be happy for me.
be proud! Shit!
you know? I'm focused! What is your problem?
the only thing you're focused on is drinking and Denny!
be glad that I have a dream!
I was just going to tell you how proud I am of you.
that's the sad thing.
what?
well, I'm not going to now.
not after that outburst.
fine, I don't care.
I'm in the kitchen making dinner, and it wouldn't kill you to come up and help.
who knows? You may get there just in time to pull my head out of the oven.
Hello? - What-- what are you doing?
Oh, making the girls' lunches. - Good for you.
Yeah, what the hell. I'm going after the Mother-of-the-year award.
see, um...
you know what I was thinking? - No.
maybe it's been... 57 years.
what are you talking about? - Halley's Comet, you know?
by the way, it's, uh...
76 years, but I'll give you that one, smarty pants.
can I come over?
when?
now.
now? - Yeah, now.
did you hang up? - Uh, not yet.
good, then, um... I'm coming over.
I am, so...
don't go hide in the yard, don't pull any reciprocal crap.
ls that what you did that day? You hid in the yard?
no, um...
you know what? Delete that last line.
look, um...
I'm coming over. I am.
I'm coming now.
hold it. Hold it!
wait, wait, wait.
what is this? - Your lunches.
our lunches? - Mm-hmm.
are you kidding? - I make my own lunch.
you haven't done it in years.
I'm back to basics. What do you want?
Bye. - Have a good day!
No!
Oh, shit. Great.
were you-- you taking off?
Hey. You're taking off, just like that?
Yeah, I'm going to hide in your yard.
Oh, come on, that's bullshit. I was kidding.
what are you doing? - Step out.
just step out.
are you stoned? - Not at all.
not a bit. - Well, you should be.
listen, l, uh...
I know that you're fresh. I know you're good and hurt and I know that on some level, this is way too soon...
and not right. - Yeah.
what's the other level?
I diaI your number 10 times a day and hang up.
come on!
just a minute.
goddamn, Terry, it's not like, you know, it's not like I'm asking a lot.
it's just
it's just
I get it, okay?
I know who I am for you.
I'm this guy that you sit and you drink...
and you talk with.
and now you want to fuck me. - Well, you offered it.
that was before you hid in your yard.
well, I'm not hiding in my yard, now am l?!
hey come on, lady! - Hey, hey, hey!
can that horn, now!
Jeez!
not bad.
thank you.
you wanna... go back to my house?
I've seen your house.
I'll make the bed!
let's go to my house.
fine, let's go to your house.
Oh, God.
now that was a reaI misstep.
Aw...
that was a sweet thing to say.
God, what am I doing?
why am I here?
you're here because you're sad and lonely.
desperate.
you need someone, something, anything to fill you. Any...
port in a storm. - Mmm.
I asked why I was here, not you.
what's my story?
Oh, your story is...
you're good and bent out of shape.
pissed off like I've never seen a woman.
what?
it's a speciaI day for her. So, just be nice.
she's excited for you to meet him. - Oh, really, how excited can she be? She's been seeing him for three years.
and she's in love? She's in love?
I'm just hearing about this today? - Be nice!
it's not in my nature. Why does she hate me so damn much?
she doesn't hate you, she just thinks that he's stupid.
she thinks he's stupid?! I thought she loved him.
no, she thinks you'll think he's stupid.
well, I won't think that. That's my point.
she judges me so harshly. I am her mother.
okay. - I love her. I want her to be happy.
I mean, if she loves this guy I'm gonna love
okie dokie. - Hi! Hi! Oh, baby!
baby!
Oh God, I'm so proud of you! I am!
I am so proud of you.
let me see your face. - Mother.
a college graduate. I'm so proud of you.
your father doesn't know what he's missing today.
I think he might. Mm-mmm!
this is it. This is life.
mom?
David. Hi, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.
my parents are having lunch at the Wheeler hotel.
you're all invited. - The Wheeler, really?
We'd-- well, girls, would you like that?
we-- we had lunch. - Have it again.
come on, I want us to go. I want you to meet David's parents.
david you tell your folks we'd absolutely love to join them, okay?
cool. Okay, see you later. - See you later.
Bye.
Wow.
he is so handsome.
nice and...
intelligent. - Mother.
Oh! He is, baby. I can tell by looking at him.
he's incredibly intelligent.
all right... um...
there's something you all should know.
you're pregnant and you're getting married.
how did you know that? Who told you that?
I guessed? Really?
I guessed that? I was right?
no, you've got to be kidding me.
no, I'm-- I'm not.
I'm getting married.
this is how I find out?
through Popeye? A 15-year-old?
don't be condescending-- - Close it!
you are a child. What do you know?
Oh, that old chestnut.
you close it as well, please.
do his parents know?
Yes, they're ecstatic.
Oh, how long have they been ecstatic?
you know what, can we just go to the lunch please?
how long have they been ecstatic, damn you, Hadley?!
I need a Bloody Mary as soon as is humanly possible.
Hi. I'm Terry.
Oh. Gina. Nice to meet you.
nice to meet you. - And this is David, my husband.
Oh, David Senior. That's nice.
you're not Jews, obviously.
Oh, well I mean not that that's a good or a bad thing.
that they don't just name their children after-- okay, that was horrible.
um... these are Hadley's sisters,
Emily, Andrea and Popeye.
Hi, girls. - Hi.
could we order you a drink before lunch?
Oh, I'm set for now. Thank you.
um, I'll have the same.
Mmn. Mmn!
so, I understand we have something to celebrate? Some good news, huh?
Oh, we're very excited, Terry.
we are crazy about Hadley. We really are.
I knew from the minute I met her. I did.
you did not. - I did.
no, Mother, you didn't.
if she said she did, she probably did!
well, I was taken for a surprise, - but-- but a happy one. - Yeah, well, you and me both.
should we toast? - Oh, yes. Let's do.
well-- to David and Hadley.
david and Hadley-- - Oh wait, wait, wait.
my glass is-- this is bad luck. Uh, waiter?
mother, it's okay. Here.
Oh.
Oh, just... a little more.
just
thank you.
so, shall we toast?
may I? - Please, do.
to David and Hadley.
a long and beautifuI partnership.
Aww. - Thanks.
the-- mostly right now
I'm sorry, David, this is very emotional for me.
to my baby.
my first born, my little Hadley-wadley.
Aww.
that's what we called her. Hadley-wadley.
she was so loved from the minute she was born.
just an adorable little thing.
she was-- well, she grew up too fast didn't she?
she grew up so fast and had a mouth on her.
mother!
when she was in her teens she was her own little boss.
mother!
and she would sometimes just not come home
all right, could we just toast, please? Thank you.
okay, baby. We'll toast.
you have to forgive me. Um...
you all had a chance to process this, and I'm just coming on board, so to speak.
to Hadley-wadley.
Mmn.
Oh.
Oh!
Oh, no, no. I'm done toasting.
I'm just ordering another drink.
it was horrible. - Maybe it wasn't.
maybe it wasn't as bad as you thought.
no, it was horrible.
it was. I made an ass of myseIf. I was like...
a public service film against drinking.
just
Yeah, I was an old lush.
poor Hadley.
I feel so bad for her, Denny.
why are we going out here?
I hate the way I come off to my girls.
I just hate that I can't control my emotions.
Oh God.
this is creepy.
this was all a farm owned by the...
Firestone family untiI the 50's.
this and the whole subdivision.
it goes on a bit about another eight acres.
why are we out here today?
I wanna do it.
out here? - No.
don't be an asshole.
I wanna sell my part of it.
just let your friends develop the lots and tell them "Yes."
tell them I don't need the money, though.
if they think I need the money, they'll play games with me.
do you? - No.
Yes. No. I don't know.
I'm in some trouble...
unless I officially divorce the shitbox which I refuse to do, until at least he has the balls to show his face.
I wanna give the girls the money.
just tell your friend Shep I want to make the deal.
what?
nothin'.
good. I'm going in.
this place is a clearinghouse for Lime disease.
Hey, this is cute. - Shep...
how are you, pal? - I'm doing great.
I'm hanging with Andy, how could I not be?
Hello, Terry.
Hadley's boyfriend.
okay, okay.
we're gonna go watch a movie. - lsn't that sweet?
"the Bicycle Thief." She's never seen "The Bicycle Thief."
he's a nut for foreign cinema.
anyone wanna join us?
snuggle up on the couch? Watch a classic?
I think we'll, uh, probably pass.
is it the subtitles?
you know me too well.
I do and it's a burden.
I know him too well... - Okay.
so it's a burden. That's it.
okay.
I cannot tell you how much this thing disgusts me.
Oh, come on. She's doing great at work.
Shep's got her producing morning drive-time, plus... I think he really likes her.
Oh, the whole thing just infuriates me.
that's probably haIf the attraction.
what?
you know what. Not another word.
the deep hatred that men have felt for one another through the ages has blossomed into one chapter after another of repression, violence, hate, rape, religious slang and genocide.
I'm still working on it.
I need to fix the music.
it's my finaI in television production.
you're really handsome, Gorden.
Thanks.
I should go.
I really do have to go.
the power of stress and naked anger is seen over and over again in the relationships that exist between the male and the female of our species.
here, in rural Botswana, an unfaithful tribeswoman is brought to a field by a group of locals for a ritualized punishment of beating and harassment.
events quickly spiral out of controI for the tribesmen, though as the woman's fury becomes too great to contain and the men are quickly forced to flee for their safety.
why am I not excited by it?
um, because I don't think any of these new age arts colleges are really colleges.
of course, it's a college. What are you talking about?
honey, I've been there. I have.
I wanted to be a poet, remember?
just take arts courses at Ann Arbor.
I don't want to go to school in Ann Arbor.
no, of course you don't. It's what I want you to do. Why would you?
okay, four years learning dance theory?
I have a theory about that.
it's not going to happen.
how's the show? You enjoying it?
I wish you would take me seriously.
honey, I take you seriously.
I just don't think you have much capacity for self-evaluation.
you know, you'd think you'd be happy for me...
considering the way your life turned out.
the way your parents pushed you-- - To marry your father?
Yeah. - I'm not complaining.
they pushed me to take life seriously...
not to live in the clouds.
do you have any idea what a fucking idiot you sound like sometimes?
I love how you worry that the letter you sent to the parent who deserted you is too mean, and yet, to the one who's here in the fight, you have no problem saying the most vile things.
lsn't that a tad odd?
please finish setting the table.
fuck you!
Shep, wake up. Wake up, wake up.
Hey. - Oh, it's 5: 00.
okay, 5: 00. Just
no, my mother's downstairs we need to get up.
we need to get up right-- Ah, hello!
okay, not now. We need to get
no, we need to get up. - And
for over a century, I have lived in secret until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
what are you?
I'm a vampire.
you said you don't kill to survive.
animal blood keeps me alive.
but not as strong as Damon.
Hello, brother. - Damon.
Stefan finally fessed up. - Stay away from me.
that necklace contains an herb called vervain.
it protects you from being compelled.
I will keep your secret, but...
I can't be with you, Stefan.
what is that? - A very important crystal.
are you psychic or clairvoyant?
technically gram says I'm a witch.
there was a time when this town was
very much aware of vampires
five bodies all drained off blood.
they've come back.
you just don't wanna die, do you?
she's transitioning. - Into what?
a vampire.
I don't know what's wrong with her.
she'll be fine. - No , We'll all be fine. - Vicky
I will make sure that she does not hurt anybody,
Elena. I promise you.
all right, later, man. - See you, bro.
Hi, Ty
Vicky?
everyone is looking for you.
I know.
what's wrong, Vick? - I'm so cold.
you are on drugs. Everyone thinks you are off on a bender.
I wish.
what happened in the woods? Vicki?
those kids that were killed.
what did you see?
I'm so scared.
come here.
it's ok. I will take you home.
I can't control it. - Control what?
I am so...hungry, Ty.
and it won't go away
what did you on?
what drugs did you take?
I want you. I'm so hungry, Ty.
OK, look, I'll get you something to eat.
just sit back. Let's just get you home.
Vicky, what is wrong with you? Vick!
let go of me.
what's going on here, Stefan?
what's wrong with her?
you don't talk. - Screw you, dude.
dude, really? Dude...
Damon, don't.
Oh, come on. No one is gonna miss this idiot.
don't you hurt him.
forget what you saw here tonight.
none of us were here.
sorry. - Oh, no, it's cool. I'm done.
you are up early. Where are you going?
police station. They are organizing.
a search party for Vicky, so...
wait. Shouldn't you be going to school?
you are kidding me, right?
you shouldn't skip school.
if they find her, we will know.
that's what cellphones are for.
your lips keep moving. I don't know why.
yeah?
Matty?
Vicky, where are you? Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
tell me where you are. I'll come and get you.
no, Matty. I just need some time.
to figure things out.
just know that I'm OK. Please don't worry about me.
I don't understand why I'm still cooped up here.
why can't I just go home?
because you are changing, Vicky.
and it is not something you want to do alone.
there is nothing about that Logan guy I killed in here.
not a word.
someone has covered it up.
what is that?
it's a very special, very old compass.
what was Logan fell doing with it.
aren't you curious?
well, If you are so worried that somebody is onto you
why don't you just leave town, Damon?
we should all be worried.
Hey, I'm hungry.
do you have anything to eat?
here.
what is it?
it's what you are craving.
don't lie to the girl.
so not what you are craving,
but it will do in a pinch. Right, Stef - What is it? - Yeah, What is it?
it's skunk, saint bernard, bambi?
go on, give it a try.
she is new. She needs people blood.
she can't sustain on that stuff.
Yeah, why can't I have people blood? - Yeah.
because it's wrong to prey on innocent people, Vicky.
you don't have to kill to feed.
just find someone really tasty,
and then erase their memory afterwards.
so easy.
no, no, no.
there's no guarantee that you can control yourself, Ok?
it takes years to learn that.
you could easily kill somebody,
and then you have to carry that with you for the rest of your life.
which, if I haven't made clear, is eternity.
don't listen to him.
he walks on a moral plane way out of our eye line.
I say, snatch, eat, erase.
Hey, look at me. We choose our own path, our values and our actions. They define where we are.
OK, count deepak.
I am out of here.
can I have some more?
is Stephen here?
Yep.
where is he?
and good morning to you, little miss, I'm on a mission.
how can you be so arrogant and glib after everything you've done?
and how can you be so brave and stupid,
to call a vampire arrogant and glib?
if you wanna me be dead and I'll be dead.
Yes, you were.
and I'm not. - Yet.
where is Stephen? - He's upstairs.
singing "The rain in Spain," knock yourself out.
Stephen?
Stephen?
Yes.
where is Vicki?
she's upstairs.
what happens now?
because my brother is out there searching for her with the rest the town.
and I'll tell him. - I'm working with her.
but, it's gonna take time.
she's very volatile and impulsive personality.
she is a drug user.
I mean all that's gonna play a part in how she responds to this.
so she is a vampire with issues?
what am I supposed to do?
because I'm lying to everyone I care about.
what's gonna happen to her?
I'll keep her here with me.
until I know that she is safe.
how long is that?
we can talk about it that later.
Hey, Vicki,
how are you?
how am I? You're kidding, right?
was our family burned in witch trials?
no. The girls that were persecuted in Salem,
entirely innocent.
you have to have more than ignorance to trap a real witch.
how did we end up in Mystic Falls?
our family fled Salem in 1692,
and relocated here.
our ancestors lived in secrecy for over a hundred years.
it's important that we still do.
grams. Everybody knows you're a witch.
they also know it's absurd, can't be true.
I'm just a cooky lady that teaches occult at the university.
no one really believes.
they just poke fun. And let them go.
just don't let them know the truth.
where does our witchcraft?
you've been talking history for two days.
and I wanna go to the fun part.
it's not meant to be fun.
it's real, and it's serious.
and you must understand before you practice.
aren't you late for school?
you never should have trusted that Logan - Weasel with that watch. - How many are we dealing with?
well, that coroner thinks one.
something about the wound radius and the jaw pattern.
are we in danger?
I mean if it found the watch and knows we know,
and could it come after us?
and should I even be saying "it,
or he, or she.
if they have any historical knowledge of the town,
and they'll know where the watch come from.
so yes, we can very much be in danger.
so what do we do?
just keep quiet, we can't have the entire town aware of this,
we need to find him before he finds us.
I heard they were putting together a search party for Vicki.
she just called, she's OK.
Oh, good. It's great.
I figured you must've been going out of your mind.
a little bit, yeah.
I was just gonna offer.
is there anything I can do?
I appreciate it.
I have got your costume. It's all here.
Seriously? - Come on
can someone please be excited about the Halloween?
I just wanna have fun, you know.
just some silly, fluffy, Damon-free fun.
isn't this the one you got from Damon?
Yep. Wear or toss it. I don't care.
I just want it gone.
have you seen Elena?
do you know what she is wearing?
I was with grams all weekend. I haven't talked to her.
maybe, she's with Stephen.
riding to his castle on his white horse？
don't be bitter. It provokes wrinkles.
coffee is our friend.
it's the caffeine. It circulates through our veins,
and warms our bodies.
so we are not so cold to the touch.
what if I wanna drink human blood?
you gotta have to learn to live with that urge.
and fight it one a daily basis, one day a time.
Oh, God. Don't start with the whole little twelve steps thing.
school Counselor has been down that road. And it doesn't work for me.
it can work. It's your choice, Viki.
so you've never tasted human blood.
not in a long time.
how long?
years and years.
I'm not proud of my brother's behavior.
Oh, does this sketchy feeling ever go away,
it's like I have a massive hangover.
this daylight thing is a bitch,
I need more blood.
Where's your bathroom? I have to pee.
why do I have to pee? I thought I was dead.
I'm going to, Un-- I'm gonna get her some more.
right.
I will be quick.
my body is feeling really funky.
it's a good funk, but it's weird - Who are you calling? - Jeremy.
Viki, you can't see Jeremy any more.
Oh, come on. Don't you start.
I'm gonna see whoever I want to see.
even though you could hurt him?
I would never hurt Jeremy
I know you don't think that.
but I can't take that risk - You gonna have to let Jeremy go now - Oh really?
and how long have you been preparing a "you're not good enough" speech?
I'm presuming it predates the whole vampire thing.
all I'm saying is
Jeremy is not getting involved in any of this.
I mean it, Viki.
or what?
let's get one thing straight, you perky little bitch,
you had my brother whipped for 15 years.
15 years, and then you dumped him.
when I look at you,
that is all I see，
just so you know.
and I'm gonna see Jeremy whenever I wanna see Jeremy,
because I have some fun new toys to play with,
and I won't think twice of ripping your little head off.
you got it? - She threatened me -She's on edge.
imagining every sense in your body,
operating at super speed.
I mean, she's uncomfortable in her own skin,
and then when you throw on her other issues.
how long before it settles? Hours, days, weeks?
there's no rule book.
well how long before you learn to control her?
a while.
but I didn't have anybody helping me.
I have to do it on my own.
the thing is
it's hard to resist certain people,
especially when you are new.
it's difficult to separate your feelings.
love, lost, anger, desire
it can all blur into one urge,
hunger
what does that mean?
it means that Jeremy can't see her. Not now.
she might not be able to resist him,
and she could hurt him.
or worse.
I'm not gonna let anybody get hurt.
I need to get going.
Elena,
please Stephan. This is only so much I can take.
what are you doing?
just contemplating the next hundreds of years.
why did you do it?
I was...
bored.
you did this to me out of boredom,
it's one of the pitfalls of eternity.
now I'm bored
and all I can think about is blood.
I just want some blood.
I can't think about anything else. What is that about?
that'll ease up.
you've just been cooped up all day.
let's go - Where?
your life was pathetic.
your afterlife doesn't have to be.
what are you doing?
she's been cooped up in your room all day.
she is not Anne Frank.
no no no no. Hey hey,
now is not the time for this.
if you are gonna teach her,
show her what it's all about.
she could hurt someone,
I'm not taking her to Disneyland.
we're going in the front yard.
come on!
bad idea, Damon.
she is a vampire, Stephan.
she should know the perks.
like what?
like...
whoa. How did you do that?
come on, Viki,
live a little. No pun intended.
uh, my bad.
Matt?
Vicki?
that's you?
get in here.
in a minute.
please come inside, I've been worried.
God, you're ok.
where were you, Vick?
it's no big deal.
dropped it, already.
three people were murdered in the woods.
the cops were looking for you, they wanna question you.
they know where I live.
everyone was worry about you.
I'm back now, just let it go.
are you kidding?
I'd freaking search purty looking out for you when you were off on your crazy drug trip.
and you want me to let it go?
my head hurts.
you think.
Stefan, what are you doing here?
is Vicki home? - Yeah.
can I see her please?
dot's let him in, I don't want him in here.
did he do something to you?
no, I just don't want him in here.
just let me come in, so I can explain myself.
I don't know what's going on, but I think you'd leave now.
Matt, please.
no, Stefan.
you get to call me, Vicki.
I don't get what's going on with you. Just call me, please.
so, do you wanna hang out tonight?
we can go to the Halloween thing at school.
it could be fun.
good, sure, sounds...sounds fun,
can't wait.
I know you are upset about Vicki.
I heard you called mad.
but you can't be with her.
she needs you to get better.
the best thing you can do for her is let her go.
what does that even mean let her go?
Oh, ok, sure, she was such an expert on letting people go, right?
I know you may not see it yet.
but trust me, Jer, it's for the best.
for months from Mum and Dad dead, I feel like a crap.
well, nothing really even matter a crap.
now all of a sudden, I got these moments,
and things started to feel just a little bit better,
and Vicki was in every single one of them.
so you may not see it.
but trust me. Keeping me away from her is not for the best.
Seidel? For the ladies? Is a lot with special?
no way,
last year I was hang over untill Thanksgiving.
wait, I am going to drink,
untill someone is hot enough to make out with me.
sounds like a plan.
how many Martinies have you had?
ahh, don't stuck with me.
can we go now? We are leaving for the Halloween party.
let's go.
so go ahead.
I'd like to finish my drink.
let me guess.
Dessie Becanon.
I love the guess-beaten look.
I've met you before.
aren't you Caroline Phobos' boyfriend?
no, she had the school girl's crush on me.
it's cute. But I had to let her down. Easy.
it's Damon, right?
Oh, you remember me.
you have a face that's hard to forget.
what's your last name, Damon?
Salvatore
are you in any relation with Zach?
Zach is my uncle.
how do you know Zach?
are you ok?
Yes, because something is in my eye.
well, I know Zach from the Founders' Council.
you know, the Salvatores were born in this town's Original saddles.
Yes, they were.
I wasn't aware that Zach was remembered.
I just recently come back home,
and really haven't had chance to meet any of these friends.
would you tell him to return my calls?
I've left several messages.
Zach was out of the town. It's forbidden.
but if it is about the vervain,
you know about the vervain?
well, I'm a Salvatore. Of course I do. - Of course.
Cheers.
you wear Plastic Surgery costume too. Ah?
Yes, I just didn't know any other clothes coming to me until an hour ago.
me either.
and you are going as... you?
he's not talking to me right now. We've gotten into a fight.
I got into with Vicki too when she got home.
I tried not to stick with her tonight, but...
part of me just didn't want her out of my sight.
she's here?
Yes, you can't miss her. She's a vampire.
Oh, where did Jeremy go?
Elena, what's the matter? - I'm going. I got to find him.
what? You're following me now?
you don't really give me much of the choice.
let me out of here.
you shouldn't have been here.
crowds like this will make it even harder for you to make yourself under control.
I'm fine. - Really?
no headache? Your stomach has not agonized you?
not feeling light headed? Or anxious or cranky?
like if someboby look at you in a wrong way,
you can just rape their head off.
do you know what's that called?
it's called hunger.
and it only will get worse and worse every minute.
that you pretend like it's not controlling you.
so you need vervain?
Yes.
my husband and I only have flowers,
which his parents left him.
and Zach had promised,
he could supply us with more.
well, I talked to him all the time.
so why don't they just ask him?
how much you need, how many people do you think?
well, these are children, of course.
of course.
and friends, family,
and everyone on the council.
the council?
Zach knows how many?
you know, I am so late,
my husband is not going to be happy with me.
well, are you happy with your husband?
you're flirting with me. - You flirt with me first.
true.
let me escort you to the school.
it's not safe out there alone.
I mean, I've seen ten vampires tonight.
only the real ones were easy to find.
how is that search going?
we had the Founders' Party.
and anyone arrived during the day
was eliminated as suspect.
and otherwise we were just dead and so.
I gonna go. - Ok - I gonna go. - Ok - Thank god. - What's the matter?
I lost track of Jeremy. I was worried.
what's going on?
Hey, uh, Everything's fine.
I told you to quit bothering me.
no, Viki. Don't do this.
Matt, He won't leave me alone.
you need the back off, man. - Matt, it's.it's ok.
No! It's not ok. What the hell is your problem?
Staffen, she's gone.
I'm trying to help her.
Viki, you just scare me. - I'm sorry.
come on. - Ok.
So.Where'd Caroline ran up to?
do yourself a favor, Damon.
don't ask me about Caroline.
Oh, but Bonnie, so loyal.
just stay away from her.
Where'd you get that?
from a friend.
Caroline?
you know that's mine, don't you? - Not any more.
funny.
I'd like it back, please. - I'm not giving it to you.
I'll give it to Caroline. She can give to you if she feels like it.
or I could just take it right now.
Jeremy,
I was so worry about you.
I'm fine now, but...
I gotta leave.
what? Where?
I gotta get out of here, Jer.
I just, I can't live at home with Matt.
he just dosn't get it.
no, You can't, You can't just leave.
come with me.
if you come with me, we can be together forever.
OK.
Yeah.
Really? I know it's so cool. I know it's awesome.
what? What is it?
viki?
Viki. Viki. What the hell?
Oh, my god!
No! Stop!
No!
Viki! No!
no.
Vicki
go, get inside,
go!
Vicki
Vicki
Vicki
Vicki
get him out of here.
what? - I need your help.
what happened to you?
I did something I don't know.
it came from my necklace.
Where'd you get that?
it's part my costume, it's piece of junk.
that piece of junk belongs to one of the most powerful witches of our family.
let me show you.
there she is.
Emily Bennet.
your great great great great grandmother.
and there is your necklace.
you should go. I got this.
you did this. This is your fault.
you confuse me for someone with remorse.
none of this matters to me.
none of it.
people die around you. How could it not matter?
it matters and you know it.
you need to leave.
your wounds are bleeding.
and you need to leave.
Elena. Hey! Have you seen...
whoa. What... what happened?
nothing. Some idiot with some fake blood got me.
I'm gonna go home and shower.
I can't find Vicki. She totally bailed on me.
I don't know where she is.
is this what I'm in for a lifetime of worrying about her?
you're a good brother, Matt.
Yeah. Maybe she went home.
maybe...
okay.
where is he?
inside.
do you understand what happened tonight?
no...
I don't understand. I mean I know what I saw, but...
I don't understand.
she was going to kill me.
now she is dead. Vicki is dead.
I...I'm so sorry. Jer.
make it stop. It hurts.
Shh，Shh, Shh. It's okay...It's okay.
why does everybody have to die on me?
Oh, my god. Come here.
are you ok?
I...uh...I wanted to help her.
but, instead...uh...
how's he doing?
he's a mess.
I don't want him going through this again.
he is just a kid.
Elena, what can I do?
what can I do to help? I'll do anything.
can you make him forget?
I can't do that.
Stefan, please!
I don't know how he'll ever get past this?
I just want him to forget everything that happened.
if I did. There's no guarantee that it would work.
because of whom I am. Because of how I live.
I don't have the ability do it right. - I can do it.
if this is what you want.
I'll do it.
it's what I want.
what you want me now?
I want you to tell him...
that Vicki left town.
and she's not coming back.
that he shouldn't look for her or worry about her.
he's gotta miss her,
but he's known that's for the best.
part of me wishes that I could forget, too...
forget meeting you.
finding out what you are
and everything that's happened since.
if that's what you want.
Yes, it is.
because I don't want it to be likes this.
I don't wanna feel like this.
but I can't.
with everything that's happened...
I can't lose the way I feel about you.
it's done
how long has it been since you had a drop of human blood?
since the night I threatened to drive Elena off the wickery bridge.
you're not going to survive this cold-turkey thing.
you never do. Go on. Have a bite.
what are you doing? Stefan?
Elena... -- This was a murder.
someone drove this stake through his heart.
I would know if I were killing people!
have you had any blackouts? Instances of lost time?
you wear a ring that lets you cheat death, Ric.
how many times can you die before it changes you?
what are you looking for?
I don't know.
a tumor, vascular anomalies.
anything physical that might explain his behavior.
if it's medical, I can treat it.
and if it's not? - Well...
then we'll deal with that, too.
when did you suspect him?
that it was Alaric who was killing all of those people?
it was after he told me about his ring.
I remembered a story my grandmother had told me about Samantha Gilbert her secret journal.
I don't know if you know this, but we Fells are notorious busybodies.
then why did you protect him?
because I'm a doctor.
I don't like to see someone hurt by something they have no control over.
and, because when he and I first met, I felt like, I don't know, I... I just kind of want to help him.
No!
Meredith!
Meredith...
everything all right in there?
Yeah.
Yeah, everything's ok.
Meredith says that everything is normal.
well, everything is normal.
because there is nothing wrong with me.
I didn't kill Brian Walters, I didn't kill Bill Forbes.
and I sure as hell didn't shove a hunting knife into my stomach.
or I did, and I've gone insane, just like your ancestor, who wore that ring.
look, i'm going to call Bonnie.
the rings were made by a bennett witch.
maybe a witch can reverse the damage.
take it.
I don't want it anymore.
ready to ditch this house of horrors?
oof. Terrible.
Yeah.
let me... let me check out of here.
don't worry about him. We'll take him out for chicken soup, we'll get him a martini, make sure he doesn't kill anybody.
what is wrong with you?
how could you just go out feeding with stefan like some vampire pub crawl?
Oh, right. I thought we were talking about Alaric, but of course we're talking about Stefan.
you stood there and let him feed on an innocent girl!
I didn't let him do anything.
if you want to get nit-picky about it. -- I made him. -- Why would you do that?
because we're vampires, Elena. We need human blood to servive. We predators, not puppies.
well, Stefan found a way around it before.
Stefan has built himself a delusional wagon which he has repeatedly fallen off of.
what he needs to learn is control.
he was able to manage it when he was drinking my blood.
small amounts every singly day. -- Ah, yes.
back when you two were in love and it was all rainbows and unicorns.
I'm just saying. Maybe you're not the right person to be teaching Stefan about self-control.
Hey! -Hey.
I totally lucked out. The hospital just had a blood drive, so, I got some O negatives, some As, and, my persaonal favorite, B positive.
Yeah. I made her a daylight ring.
she's just been standing out there all morning.
I don't think she's taking this very well.
well, it's only been a few days since she turned.
your mom's still adjusting.
miss Wilson?
why don't you come inside?
you know, have something to drink.
I can't feel it anymore.
my garden.
it's gone.
I can't feel anything.
I don't understand.
witches have a connection to the earth.
we can literally feel nature.
life.
when Abby became a vampire, she lost it.
I don't know how to help her.
Rebekah's up to something.
she's been snooping around in places she shouldn't be.
tell me again, why are we here?
Ric, the world can't stop just because you're an accidental psycho killer.
do you have any tact whatsoever?
Alaric!
I'm glad you're here. Did you bring the sign?
the restored Wickery bridge sign.
the history department promised me you would have it today.
no, I don't have the sign, actually.
it slipped... slipped my mind.
I've been...busy.
well, it's not an emergency.
we'll just, um, unveil it when the bridge is complete.
get me out of here.
my pleasure.
I'm going to stick around for a bit.
who is that? -- Blast from the past.
...construction has begun replacing the original wooden support structure to meet modern safety standards.
and, our beautification phase will begin in the spring.
so give yourselves a hand.
Damon salvatore. My favorite student.
sage, my hottest teacher. What are you doing here?
I'm just passing through. -- Oh, come on.
no one just passes through Mystic Falls.
look what the cat dragged in.
easy there, Rebekah.
you know, she used to beat men for sport.
she always was quite common. -- Rebekah.
what a happy surprise.
what are you doing here, sage? - Well, I heard Finn was finally frees from that casket.
your rageaholic brother Klaus carted him around in.
Oh, Finn. You just missed him.
he left town and didn't tell a soul where he was going.
Oh. He probably went looking for me.
or, quite possibly, he forgot all about you.
I doubt that.
Oh?
because he didn't seem to mention you.
sorry you came all this way for nothing.
have a nice life.
God, I hate that ugly elitist original bitch.
Hi.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Damon told Alaric that there was no one home.
otherwise, I would have... -- I just got home.
I just came by to pick up this book that you found on my ancestor Samantha.
that's fine.
uh, how are you doing?
Damon said that you were...
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm ok.
did you get everything you need?
Yeah.
well, if there's anything I can do to help...
you don't have to read that, you know.
I can just tell you what happened.
Samantha Gilbert was committed to an insane asylum.
she tried to give herself a lobotomy with a knitting needle.
and bled to death on the floor of her cell.
if the same thing is happening to Alaric, then there's... nothing you can do.
OK, well...
I'm going to let you get back to, uh, whatever it was you were doing.
Finn? Really?
he's my one true love.
he turned me so we could be together forever.
then Klaus daggered him and locked him away and I've been waiting ever since.
please don't tell me that you and Rebekah are friends.
Ah, not unless you count the hate sex. -- Good.
cause her and Klaus always treated me like some peasant whore.
Ah, she's just lurking around because she wants something from me.
I can't figure out what it is, though.
why don't you get inside her head and find it?
because it's impossible. She's too strong.
I bet I can get in there. -- Sage, she's an original.
it's not going to happen.
have you forgotten everything I taught you?
rebekah may be an original, but she's a girl.
you find her weakness and exploit it, and I'll walk right in. That is if you want my help.
anyone ever tell you you're sexy when you're bitchy?
we're talking now, are we?
because you were quite rude the other day.
using me to help you with Stefan, and then shooing me away like a stray dog.
Ah, that was brother business. You can't hold that against me.
besides, I really did appreciate your help.
even if I didn't show it.
you were mean. -- You like mean.
no. I don't. -- No?
you didn't get a thrill back there pushing Sage down, crushing her dreams of true love?
maybe a little.
see?
mean.
can Sage and I interest you in a drink back at the house?
not a chance in hell.
you know what they say.
two's company. Three is a party.
fine.
enjoy the rest of your day.
haven't seen you up at the house.
Abby's been asking for you.
I've been pretty busy.
Hey, hey! Stay away from me! -- Easy!
I was just going to help you carry the firewood up!
you're scared of her.
she's a vampire.
she needs to feel connected to the people she loves.
she needs to feel normal right now...
she's not normal. None of this is normal.
well, Abby didn't choose this. This was forced on her.
she could have let herself die but she didn't.
she's trying to make this work so she can be there for you, and for Bonnie, so...so just get over yourself!
OK?
Hey, what's going on?
Bonnie's not returning any of my calls.
sorry. She's still mad.
and, seriously, Abby's transition has been a little rough, so she's got a lot on her mind.
I know. And I get it. But...
something really terrible is happening to Ric, and I really need her help.
I really don't think you should be looking through that stuff.
Ah, it's the truth.
restraining orders and all.
my life in a series of police reports.
you don't strike me as an angry guy.
which sounds weird, given everything.
but... you don't.
Yeah, well, I was stupid when I was younger.
but listen, it's not like these guys didn't have it coming.
I mean... this guy here broke a beer bottle over a bartender's head.
and this guy... Hit his girlfriend.
and this guy...
OK, this guy was just a douche.
everyone needs to find a way to deal with their dark side.
some people meditate.
I became a vampire hunter.
Mmm, semi-retired.
listen, there's something that's not in these reports that I need to tell you about.
OK...
ominous. Shoot.
your cousin Logan Fell, the one who was vampire slayed...
I did the slaying.
the vampire thing...
it's not my fight.
I use their blood for what I need and leave the judgment to everyone else.
although, I have kind of been wondering why you never drew a stake through Damon's heart.
I tried once.
he killed me.
Yeah.
Yeah, figures.
the thing that started all this ring stuff was me being angry enough to think I could take on a vampire in the first place.
Oh, come on. Slow down, brother.
whoa.
control, remember? Doesn't matter whether it's blondes or blood bags, same principles apply.
what did you say to Elena this morning?
Oh, you're stress eating. Sublimating.
you need to observe each other while you're pining and moping.
I asked you a question, Damon.
I told her what she already knows...you're a vampire and you drink human blood. And to get over it.
which is the same thing I'm telling you.
own it, live it, love it.
stop being ashamed of who you are.
do me a favor, Damon...
next time you talk to Elena, - Keep me out of it, ok? - Gladly.
now, unless you're interested in a Sage-Rebekah sex sandwich, I suggest you make yourself...scarce.
who are you, again?
the guy who lives out back.
you know, the one you're not related to.
right.
Caroline and I had a little talk.
sounds like code for Caroline lectured you.
maybe. But I needed it.
Abby's always been there for me.
now it's my turn.
thought I could build a fire. -- Please.
maybe It'll distract everyone from my crappy cooking.
Jamie...
I'm so sorry, Abby.
I'm sorry about everything.
No!
Abby!
remember this song?
all right, Miss Master Seductress, where's our victim?
patience.
between her craving for affection and her pathological fear of being left alone, our little get together is too tempting to resist.
Finn's gone, you know.
I choose to believe otherwise.
he strung you along for 900 years, didn't bother to call. He's gone.
you know, the Damon I knew was holding out for someone, too.
Yes, he was. Hope's a bitch, Sage.
get out while you can.
the sweet chime of desperation.
I stole it from Nik who stole it from a queen.
I'm not sure which one.
well, this is depressing.
what happened to the party?
it just arrived.
how about a duet?
what about her?
I want her. I want you.
you have to drink these. It'll help.
I almost killed him!
Caroline said that this kind of thing happens a lot at first, when you're still...
no, no. I should just go right before I hurt Jamie again, or you!
the only way you're going to hurt me is if you leave.
don't give up on this. Not again.
we can make this work.
he's fine.
nothing a little vampire blood can't cure.
thank you.
now I need a favor.
listen, I want you to have this.
this is a list of my bank accounts, passwords, where to find my will and how to contact my family just in case this doesn't go my way.
no, no, don't even think like that.
Elena, I need to know that you and Jeremy are going to be ok.
we're all going to be fine.
Caroline?
so Abby thinks Bonnie can reverse the damage with a spell.
I guess the same thing happens with witches who become obsessed with dark magic.
they lose control and start acting out their darkest impulses.
thank you so much.
I'm going to hang back here with Abby, but Bonnie's leaving now, so if...
um, hold on.
I need a personal effect of Alaric's.
something he wore before he started wearing the ring.
OK. I'll get it.
um... Bonnie, I'm so sorry for everything.
thank you for doing this.
be ready to do the spell as soon as I get there.
we have to work fast.
I'll see you soon.
good news, bad news?
Bonnie thinks that she can help you with a spell.
well, it's worth a try. But she needs something that you wore before you put on the ring.
something personal.
well, there's, uh...my wedding ring
it's at the loft.
OK, yeah.
um, that's a good idea.
I think it's better if you stay here with me.
Oh, you and your tranquilizers.
it's in the dresser by the kitchen.
it's in, uh, an aspirin bottle.
probably covered in cobwebs.
OK.
I take it back.
your plan is amazing.
I told you, if you got her comfortable enough...She's an open book.
well, are you going to torture me or are you going to tell me what she's up to?
I'd rather show you.
the white oak tree.
it must have been the only tree to replace the old.
it probably got cut down.
do you happen to know who kept the milling ledgers during that period?
there's another tree.
milling records?
our family made one of its many fortunes selling lumber.
that's why Rebekah's been digging around about this stuff.
that tree was on our land and milled by our yard.
the letters will tell me where it was shipped.
the business archives should be around here somewhere.
get upstairs. Make sure you keep her distracted.
you've got to be kidding me.
missed you at the house.
Alaric told me you'd be here.
you made yourself perfectly clear this morning, Stefan.
you don't want to be around me.
I'm not trying to hurt you, Elena.
I just can't be who you want be to be right now.
I'm not in control.
so then what are you doing here?
well, I, uh, did a little more digging on Samantha Gilbert.
founding families were always pretty good about destroying their records, but I found a couple of newspaper articles.
seems she killed two people while she was in the institution.
a nurse and a guard.
so she was a psychopath. I get it.
she was under suicide watch.
no personal effects. No jewelry.
wait, so you're saying that the violent behavior can still happen even if the person isn't wearing the ring?
still with me?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm still with you.
I'm half-dead, too.
neither one of us has slept in two days.
don't worry, I've got coffee on.
rebekah just left.
happy, I hope.
did you find what you were looking for?
Yep. In 1912, the Salvatore Milling Company chopped down a forest.
its most valuable wood came from an old white oak tree that was used to make the Wickery bridge.
these aren't public records, so Rebekah's going to chase her tail for a long time.
so all the wood stripped from the underside of that bridge is basically a weapon that could kill an original.
Yep.
you see how this could be a problem for me, right?
Why?
because of your true love Finn?
let me tell you something... I've met the guy.
you're not going to miss him.
I will rip your head off in two seconds if you take one more dtep.
all right, let's make a deal.
you want me to kill Rebekah, I consider Finn untouchabe, you guys walk into the sunset together.
is that a promise?
Yes.
it's a promise.
if Bonnie's spell doesn't work, what are you going to do with him?
I'm not going to do anything, Stefan.
I'm going to keep looking until we can find something that will help him.
you don't know how long this has been going on.
it might be too late.
it's my family's ring that's doing this to him.
it's my responsibility to fix it.
you can't put that on yourself.
not everyone is your responsibility.
not everyone can be saved.
are we talking about Alaric here?
or are we talking about you?
because I wasn't planning on giving up on either of you.
what is that?
pictures of his victims.
sage, let's go. We have originals to kill.
sage...
Jeremy, if anything happens to me, carry on my work.
you have the other ring, let the ring make you strong.
the council must be cleansed before the work can begin.
it's the founders council roster.
looks like some sort of hit list.
no, Alaric didn't write this.
who else would have written it, Elena?
I have to get back.
looking for something?
I don't know where anything is in this house.
I'm sorry, I can't remember, do you take cream?
no cream.
I was going to make sandwiches.
I am starving.
can I ask you a question?
no mustard.
I hate mustard.
do you ever feel remorse?
sorry? -- Well...
you are a council member.
and the council was formed to protect the people of this town from vampires, yet here you all are, just looking the other way, ignoring your responsibilities.
like you, and your vampire blood.
so I'm asking you.
do you ever feel remorse?
because you should.
Aaah!
your grand plans always seem to get ruined, don't they?
sorry to disappoint you.
again.
you set me up.
no.
I'm just looking out for myself.
I told you I'd save your creepy boyfriend!
and you lied to me, Damon!
the originals are linked.
if one dies, they all die.
if I can get inside her head, don't think I'd be able to get inside yours?
I should eat you.
I'm 900 years old, Damon.
you're not capable of ending me.
do you really think that I would risk Finn's life for one of your petty revenge fantasies?
let me tell you something...
your long lost love has a suicide wish.
so when mama witch linked them together in a spell, he's the one -- who volunteered to die. -- He wouldn't do that.
he didn't want to live. Not for you, not for anyone.
he doesn't love you, Sage.
and when I do find another way to kill those originals, I'll start with Finn.
hey there.
Hi. Where's Meredith?
Oh, she got called in to the hospital for a last minute surgery, but she'll be back later.
what happened?
Oh, I broke a coffee cup and sliced my hand open trying to pick up the pieces.
but I'll... I'll live.
did Stefan catch up with you?
no.
did you get my ring?
I... I couldn't find it.
Yeah, well, my place is a bit of a disaster.
I guess I'll, uh, I'll just have to go get it.
no, don't hurt him!
I'll try not to.
Elena, I need you to come upstairs with me.
Why?
I'm going to need your help.
Meredith!
OK, ok.
you are going to be okay.
what the hell are you doing here?
just making sure the witch didn't turn you into a toad or a block of salt.
Bonnie did a little spell.
it's nothing to worry about.
just something to keep the killer in you at bay.
did something happen?
let's just say you've got an alter ego hell bent on killing council members.
so we're going to pack up some of your stuff, we're going to go to the loft, just for a little bit.
you know, it's like house arrest, light.
wait, where's Meredith?
she'll be fine, Ric.
Hey.
you ok?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Abby says that all the dying and coming back to life might have chipped away at Alaric's psyche, making it easier for the darkness to take hold.
these herbs are the binding element of the spell.
he needs to take them twice a day.
I'll get you more.
Abby and I are going to work on the garden.
how is she doing?
the transition's been hard, but I think she'll be ok.
eventually.
I'm going to go back and stay with her for a while.
it'll give us a chance to work things through.
I'm sorry, Bonnie. I didn't...I didn't want this to happen.
if there's anything that I can do to make it different, I...
I know.
please say that you forgive me.
of course I do.
am I even doing this right?
Yeah, you're doing fine. -- Ok.
Hey, um, thanks for helping out with Abby.
Bonnie's really lucky to have a friend like you.
well...
I went through the same thing once.
Ahem. With my dad.
but it didn't really work out.
so...
you know.
well, when Bonnie gets back, she can snap her fingers or wave her hands or whatever, and make the herbs bloom.
I think Abby's up.
what are you doing?
you're leaving.
you kidding me?
I have to.
I don't know how to do this. -- Do what?
be a vampire or a parent?
because I can help you be a vampire.
I can teach you self control.
but being a parent, I mean, that's all you.
Bonnie grew up without a mom because you ran away once.
but now you have an eternity to make up for it and you're just going to throw that away?
she's better off without me!
no, she's not! No one is better off without their parents.
she wants to make this work.
please.
just stay.
tell them I'm sorry.
Hello?
Hey, stranger.
Hey, you checking up on me?
do you need checking up on?
well, I'm not flunking any of my classes. Yet.
and I got a dog.
Hey, have you talked to Alaric lately?
uh, no, why?
is everything ok?
Yeah, everything is fine.
um, I just wanted to hear your voice.
OK.
Hey, can I call you later?
I'm actually on my way out with some friends.
Yeah, um, of course, Jer.
go out. Go have fun and, um...
I... I just miss you.
Yeah. Yeah, I miss you, too.
little early in the day for you, isn't it?
just having a little toast.
to what?
control.
you're happy, I'm happy.
why are you in such a good mood?
sage double crossed you, tree's a pile of ash, Alaric's got a psychopathic alter ego.
you know, Stefan, I'm a philanthropist.
I make the world a better place.
restoring bridges, landmarks, and...
historical signs made of the same white oak as the Wickery bridge.
they think all the wood burned.
I sold my rage. Phew. You should have seen me.
we have a weapon.
game's back on, brother.
let's go kill some originals.
Damon is gone.
I want you to compel me to forget that I ever loved him.
who is Damon Salvatore? - He's a monster.
to get home, we'll harness the power of the eclipse using a mystical relic.
no.
vampires murdered my wife.
I'm gonna get him to name all his vampire buddies.
need any help?
if even just a small, little part of you came back to check on me, then stay.
not doing so great, Damon.
I'm lost, brother.
it's kind of a long story, brother, but I'm back.
please just let me go.
I know this may seem a little barbaric, but I promise you, it's nothing personal.
why are you doing this?
it's a longer story than we have time for, but...
trust me... you don't want this life.
. if you can call it that.
come on. Come on.
come on. Come on. Come on.
what's that?
what is happening?
I missed you, too, buddy.
I can't believe it.
I thought you were gone.
you didn't think I was gone gone, huh?
promised you an eternity of misery.
he's back?
how?
I don't know.
honestly, everything Stefan said after,"Damon is back," is kind of a blur.
what about Bonnie?
she sacrificed herself so I can come back.
I don't want anyone to know. There's no sense making this harder than it already is.
what are we gonna tell people?
he said that she wasn't over there.
where is there, exactly?
mystic Falls, 1994?
I know. A bunch of witches were gonna get together and create some space-time purgatory, you'd think they'd pick a better year than the one that Kurt Cobain killed himself.
whole thing was just very depressing.
so how did you get back?
long story... big flash of light, two decades' worth of jet lag.
I will explain all of my adventures in that flannel hellscape, but first, there's someone I got to go see.
I don't want to see him.
I get it, but that's how you feel now, Elena.
if you thought there was even a chance you'd see Damon again, you would have never asked me to compel away your memories of loving him.
she did what?
she had Alaric do it.
Damon is going to kill me.
you're unkillable.
doesn't mean he won't try.
what do you think is gonna happen when I do see him?
I just need to see her, Stefan.
our eyes will meet, fireworks will go off, and the balance of nature will be restored.
she loves me.
he's a psychotic killer.
you onfeel that way because I erased all the good parts.
I don't see anything that could balance out the bad.
promise me you won't lift the compulsion.
promise me.
I won't, ok, not until you ask me to, thank you.
but, Elena, I hope you ask me.
I have to go.
I have a shift at the hospital.
since when?
since Damon came back and I'm trying desperately to avoid him.
fine, but if you're avoiding people, add Jo to your list.
I compelled her to forget our date the other night, and it didn't take.
what do you mean, it didn't take?
well, either she's on vervain or there's some other reason, but she can't be compelled.
so see if you can find out why.
OK.
Yeah. I will.
will you call Jeremy?
I had to tell him about Bonnie over the phone.
you can imagine how that went.
where are you going? - Out.
you promised me you'd help me track down my relatives.
just... later, ok?
Jeremy, you can't just say,"Zach Salvatore was your dad. Too bad he's dead,
and then,"peace out.
I can't do this right now.
what is so urgent to make you finally unglue your ass from the couch?
I know it's not school. It's not work.
if it's another girl, I'd shower first.
I just need to get out of here.
Tripp's errand boy returns.
Ooh, my bad.
that's all right, mate.
just lean in, and I'll take it right from the tap.
I'll pass.
come on. I'm gonna need my strength back for when you help me escape.
sorry. If Stefan turned you in, I'm guessing you deserved it.
when did Stefan's moral compass become the new true north?
wasn't he the one who scurried off to some poxy, little town while he let everyone believe he was still searching for his brother?
not exactly the hero move, if you ask me.
still, I think the general population is safer with you in here.
Yeah. Probably right, well, except for Elena...
Stefan, Caroline, you.
what do you think would happen if I were to tell your boss about known vampires and their groupies?
well, Savannah was a waste of gas.
minus a few blood bags, the house you told us about was empty.
odd.
must have smelled you coming.
hmm, would have been a total bust, except I happened upon a girl that fit the description that you gave me.
that was near Whitmore, 500 miles from where you said she was gonna be.
is this Ivy?
that's the one.
so I'm gonna give you today to conjure up the location of your vampire friends, or you and I are gonna go sightseeing in Mystic Falls.
why didn't you tell us Enzo has been locked up this whole time?
honestly, I didn't know anybody was missing him.
I'm sorry. I was confused about which vampires we like and which ones we don't.
OK. Well, what about Ivy? Is she there, too?
Tripp drove her and two others across the border last night.
Oh, God.
well, do you know where Tripp is now?
he's running down another lead, but he didn't tell me what it was.
well, can you find out?
we need to know who his next target is.
if Enzo talks, it'll be you guys.
well, that's not going to happen because we're busting him out, right, if for no other reason than so I can kick his ass for getting caught in the first place.
you have any idea how he even managed to get his hands on it?
he didn't.
I turned him in.
who is it?
Hey, it's me.
I just wanted to talk.
I can't, not now.
look. I know why you did what you did.
it's not real.
you know what's real?
the way you felt for me.
you once told me that it was the most real thing you ever felt in your life.
those feelings are gone.
Oh, come on, Elena.
you've compelled enough people to know it's just a way of covering the truth, and no matter how badly you want it done, it doesn't make it any less of a lie, you know?
Oh, I hear you breathing.
you have no idea how long I've wanted to hear you breathe.
just open the door, Elena.
everything can go back to the way it was.
just...
just open the door, Elena, please...
or, at the very least, step aside because I'm gonna kick this door in.
Seriously? You jumped out of a window?
what if somebody saw you?
I know, I know. I panicked. I don't know.
look. He's been trapped over there alone for months.
he just wants to see you.
look. I get how I'm supposed to feel, but I know how I actually feel, and I'm happy now.
what if I look at him and my old feelings break through the compulsion?
well, they won't, but even if they did, is that such a bad thing?
Yeah.
I started over just like you did, ok?
I made a smart choice for myself and for my future.
Stefan, I kissed Liam last night.
Oh, please forget that you told me that and definitely do not tell Damon that.
because he's gonna kill him, right, just like he killed my brother.
I was gonna say because he'll be heartbroken.
listen. What do you want to do? I mean, you have to see him eventually.
I know, but I just don't think eventually can be today, all right?
I'm not... I'm just not... ready.
I got to go.
Elena. - Hey.
I didn't think you were here today.
Yeah. No. I changed my schedule around.
OK.
follow me.
vampire
my
Sarah, what are you doing?
could ask you the same question.
you can't be in here.
from the look on your face, either you're downloading porn or you're not supposed to be here, either.
what are you doing in Tripp's office?
what do you want?
information on some people who used to live here.
you know anything about the Salvatores?
not really.
well, according to Jeremy, Zach Salvatore was my dad.
he supposedly died from an animal attack, and, coincidentally, so did my mom, but I've been paying attention.
I know what that's code for, and your boss seems to know a lot about homicidal wildlife, so...
so you thought breaking in here was a good idea.
guess we have that in common.
now, either you help me or start coming up with a good lie when I tell your boss you were snooping.
animal attacks are filed over there.
professor Saltzman.
what, couldn't compel yourself a Ph. D?
I can't believe you're back.
I am.
so... how the hell are you?
well, let's see, Ric.
I clawed my way out of some retro pocket universe, only to find that
I needed to compel myself a new change of clothes because this antimagic hamster ball is keeping me from going home, and then I find out that my best friend, rather than doing anything about it, decided that it was the best use of his time to compel my beautiful and lovely girlfriend to forget that she ever loved me.
I'm great, Ric. Thanks for asking.
look, Damon.
I know she was a train wreck without me, ok, but a full mind erase, seriously?
she loved you too much, and it was killing her.
well, I'm flattered, but I'm back.
so let's get this uncompulsion on the books, huh?
fine, as soon as Elena tells me that what she wants.
right.
here's the thing.
she's not gonna want to be uncompelled if she can't remember why she'd want to be uncompelled.
chicken, egg.
I know, and I'm sorry.
sorry?
she won't even see me, Ric.
I get it, Damon, but she's happy, and I'm not gonna take that away from her until she asks me to.
it's not like I don't want Elena to be happy.
I just want her to be happy with me.
right.
look. Enzo wasn't being careful.
Tripp would've caught him eventually, and that meant danger for all of us.
right. So you handed Enzo over so we wouldn't be targeted, and now you're rescuing him so we won't be targeted.
way to go.
well, I thought Tripp was gonna kill him.
I didn't think he was gonna keep him alive for information.
Oh, well, in that case, sounds like you were just being practical.
so did you rat out Ivy, too?
what?
well, you didn't want to deal with her anymore.
you wanted her gone, and now she is. n
you know what? You really should write Tripp a thank-you note.
hold on a second. Enzo turns Ivy, right?
a hunter kills her, and yet I'm the bad guy?
I'm not the one threatening to turn in other vampires to save his own skin.
the only one who's turned in other vampires is you, Stephan.
that's why you're helping... Guilt for getting Damon's friend captured.
Yeah. Damon is my brother, and I gave up on him first. Enzo didn't.
so if rescuing his idiot friend is gonna somehow make it up to him, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
great. Good for you.
let me know when you figure out how you're gonna make everything up to me.
let's get in there.
well, where the hell is he?
I like your bracelet.
what is it made of?
no idea.
while you're here, can I get your opinion on something?
sure. Yeah.
female patient...
blunt-force trauma to the head, massive internal hemorrhaging, multiple bone fractures.
she was a victim at the corn maze.
where is she?
probably freshman lit.
I don't get it.
neither do I.
see, the patient was never admitted, even with such extensive injuries.
Liam said you treated her at the scene.
that's a pretty good save for someone with half a semester of pre-med.
Yeah. You know.
I think they were exaggerating how bad off she was.
it was dark, and, yeah, there was a lot of blood.
don't.
I know what Alaric is. I know what you are.
if any more blood bags go missing, I know who to come to.
well, somebody was thorough.
no pictures of Damon anywhere.
it's kind of creepy, you just standing there all hulky and brooding.
says the freak who's stalking my sister.
technically, I'm lying in wait.
why didn't Bonnie come back?
why didn't she come back?
because she wasn't there.
it was just me.
you know I paid her cell bill so I could call her phone and hear her say the same 6 words every day?
sounds good.
I'll give it a call.
Why?
she hated you.
Bonnie wasn't there with me, Jeremy, because she found peace.
she's in a better place.
how did you know?
besides not believing that you closed a penetrating abdominal trauma without so much as a first aid kit?
pretty sure you weren't looking for stevia in my coffee.
with Alaric, I wasn't 100% certain he tried to compel me, but then I remembered I have really crappy luck in my love life.
so of course my hot, new teacher crush would be a vampire.
so then what are you?
busy.
if you want to stick around, there's food trays on the third floor that need clearing.
that's it?
you're gonna let me stay?
you saved that girl instead of feeding on her. That's good enough for me.
you're not even afraid, not ever fazed, for that matter.
there's only one thing that can resist compulsion without needing vervain, and that's a witch.
you're a witch.
how about I make a deal with you?
you don't ask questions about me, and I won't ask questions about you.
deal.
Oh, and you can tell Alaric, if he wants to avoid a complicated relationship, he doesn't have to hide behind compulsion to do it.
maybe it was a good thing I didn't grow up here.
so where do you come from?
give me the year, and I'll give you the town and foster home.
Oh, good.
wonder what's in here.
it's locked.
locked means important.
Hey, Care, did you get him?
no. Enzo is not here.
any idea where Tripp might have taken him besides the very obvious one?
hang on.
let me see that.
Caroline, we have another problem. Tripp...
has Ivy's phone.
And? I mean, the guy is a murderer. Petty theft isn't much of a stretch.
Yeah, but your name is at the top of the recent dialed list.
Oh, my God, he knows what I am.
I'm guessing he knows where to find you.
it's Bonnie. Leave me a message.
that's it?
that's your outgoing message? Really?
I mean, the one time I'm actively seeking the sound of your voice, that's all I get.
perfect.
anyway, I'm in your room, which is a lot less weird than it sounds.
I just wanted to say that because of what you did for me, today is the day that I get to see Elena.
so thank you, and I'm sorry.
other than that, I don't know what to say or what I'm supposed to say except that, defying all possible global scenarios,
I might miss you a little bit.
Ooh, hey, I got to go.
so you didn't forget my number.
that's a good start.
Yeah. I figured I'd press the Damon button and see what happened.
and what is happening?
I don't know.
I don't even know what I'm doing. I just...
I'm thinking we should meet face to face.
I can't run from you forever.
so come by my dorm?
Yeah.
Yeah. I'll be here.
there. I'll be there, absolutely, in a bit.
see you in a little bit.
OK.
well, that was fast.
who are you?
Elena, calm down.
just find Caroline and get to old Miller road. We'll get him back.
I had an interesting conversation with Elena.
Yeah, and I want to hear all about it, just not right now.
what's the rush, occult studies emergency?
Yeah. I have someplace I need to be. So if you don't mind...
why don't you just compel me out of the way?
look. Don't you think it's about time we level with each other?
OK.
how's this?
my best friend, he just came back from the dead, but now I have to save him from a vampire hunter before he's driven across an antimagic border and killed again.
so here's some friendly advice.
it's probably a good idea to stay as far away from me as possible.
morning, sunshine.
well, this brings back memories.
I'm glad you found a way back, mate.
afraid it's gonna be a short reunion, through.
we're headed to Mystic Falls, known for its bridges; quaint, small-town charm;
and a really big vampire bug zapper.
Stefan could've told me there was a hunter in town.
it probably slipped his mind because he's responsible for my return to incarceration.
why would he do that?
probably jealous of my accent.
eh, maybe he did it because I killed his new girlfriend.
Yeah.
that'll do it.
sorry, mom.
Elena is auditioning for "Top Gear.
Yeah.
OK. Bye.
so my mom is shutting down route 13.
Tripp will have to double back, and there's only two other ways across the border.
do you have a tire preference... front, back?
no? Ok.
I think this sells a spinout.
what do you think?
I want my memories back.
wait. What?
I made up my mind.
if Damon survives this, then I want Alaric to uncompel me.
I mean, I can't imagine ever loving him.
I also can't ignore the parts I don't like just to avoid the truth.
I mean, how would I make any decisions if I only know half the story?
you don't have to take apart the whole engine.
we just need to lure Tripp in so we can grab them.
you know, it's not your fault.
pretty much is.
look. You're not the only one who gave up.
every second for the last 4 months, all I could think about was when I'm gonna get my next sip of blood, when am I gonna screw up and hurt somebody, why did I come back to life just to be this thing, that I used to hunt vampires and suddenly, I was one.
searching for Damon was the only thing that could take my mind off of it, but I was basically going through the motions as a distraction because, honestly, Stefan, I'd given up, too.
there.
that's him.
you should stay in the car. He knows what you look like.
he thinks I'm on his side.
Yeah, unless Enzo told him different.
go tell Elena he's here.
evening.
tried to get my buddy to a bachelor party, and our car just stopped.
you think you can help us out?
uh, don't know anything about cars.
Yeah. Well, maybe you could give us a ride, then.
who's that?
he's up to something.
better be good.
bastard owes me.
sorry. In a bit of a hurry.
Yeah. So are we.
Stefan, what's happening?
Damon and Alaric are across the border.
I got to go.
Oh, my God.
I came back for this?
consumption wasn't much fun the first time around, either.
it's ok. I'm here.
how?
followed you like a crazy stalker, not one of my finer moments.
no, no. Get him.
you have to get me across the border.
it's stripping away the magic.
I'll die.
you'll die if I move you.
I have to stop the bleeding.
nicked your descending aorta.
I know. That's what killed me.
you didn't have me back then, did you, and you didn't have hemostatic gauze.
get up.
come on. Get up.
what's happening?
you still with me?
while I'm sealing this wound, I want you to think about how you tried to compel one of the smartest women on campus to forget about her date with you, the date where I single-handedly saved dozens of lives without smearing my makeup.
hang on.
stay with me.
come on.
gonna get that heart pumping.
you don't get to have the last word with me.
stay with me.
come on.
so... so... Something is wrong.
don't move.
no. Something is wrong.
I'm not supposed to be alive.
there's no reason you shouldn't be.
I sealed the wound.
we just have to get you to the hospital.
Yeah. I'll tell her.
Thanks.
I was just at route 9, and there was a crash, but they weren't there.
Yeah. I know. They had to get out of there.
what happened?
Stefan said that...
what, Caroline? What?
Alaric crossed the border, but Jo was there, and she saved him.
so he's ok.
that means he's ok, right?
Yeah, Elena. He's ok.
then why do you have that look on your face?
what happened, Caroline?
all the magic stripped away, but Jo saved him just before he died.
what?
I don't know what that means, Caroline.
Alaric is not a vampire anymore, Elena.
he's human.
thanks for the ride.
Yeah. I thought I'd save you the trouble of having to boost another car.
that was almost funny. Hope for you yet, Donovan.
if I told you I knew about your family, promise to take a little friendly advice?
hang on.
you know who my family is?
read any history book about the town's founding members.
the guys that live in this house are Damon and Stefan Salvatore.
why are you just telling me this now?
because...
they're vampires, and wherever they go, death and pain always follow.
so if you're looking for family, you're not gonna find it here.
do yourself a favor and get as far away from this place as you can.
come on!
no.
damn it!
I keep trying to cancel Bonnie's phone, but I can't without her pin.
why can't I remember her pin?
get off!
get off!
Hey, it's ok.
no, it's not!
she's gone.
Bonnie is gone.
Jo is a keeper.
how does it feel?
Oh, it hurts a lot.
well, it's too bad there aren't any vampires in Mystic Falls to help heal you.
well, I think they got me on a morphine drip.
it's the next best thing.
Elena, I'm so sorry.
no. No, Alaric.
I'm just glad that you're ok.
I mean, up until an hour ago, I didn't even want my memories to return.
I was the one who made the choice to lose them.
now I have to live with the fact that you can't give them back to me.
I know how much you hated being a vampire.
so I'm just glad one of us got what we wanted.
and what is it that you want?
to be able to look Damon in the eye, knowing all that I know and all that I don't, and...
see how I feel about him.
I want to trust how I feel.
I hope that you can.
good luck, ok?
this hospital sucks.
I can't believe anyone actually makes it out alive.
they usually don't.
I'm having you transferred to Whitmore ASAP.
thank you.
just doing my job.
you did more than that.
you gave me back my life.
thank you.
I was this close, this close.
I know. I'm sorry.
Oh, I got it. Everybody is sorry.
you're sorry you gave up on me, sorry you turned Enzo in to that hunter guy.
Ric is sorry for the compulsion.
I'm sure if Elena could remember anything, she'd be sorry, too.
you got to understand how hard it was for her.
I am so tired of hearing about how hard it was for her.
it was hard for me, as well.
at least you knew you had a home to come back to.
she didn't have anything.
to her, you were just gone.
guess I still am.
Ric said she's happy without me since she's erased me.
you know what?
I don't want her to be happy.
I want her to be miserable just like I am.
you done?
Yeah. I'm done.
good. Now quit stalling.
there's a girl you need to go see.
what if it doesn't work?
what if what we had isn't strong enough to break the compulsion?
you're not gonna find out just sitting there, are you?
here goes everything.
so... Am I your last stop on the Stefan Salvatore apology tour?
could we just get past this, please?
I'm trying to.
look, Caroline. What do you want me to do, huh?
stop making me guess and tell me so we can go back to being friends again.
Yeah. Well, that's the thing, Stefan.
after all of this, I...
I don't want to be friends anymore.
until now.
I am a vampire.
and this is my story.
an hour's drive to hear that crap.
you know, it wasn't even a band.
a guy with a guitar.
an hour each way.
he wasn't that bad.
he sounded like James Blunt.
what's wrong with that?
we already have a James Blunt.
one's all we need.
so why did you come?
because I love you.
nicely done.
what's with all the fog?
it'll clear in a second.
watch out!
are you ok?!
we just hit someone! Oh, my god!
call for help.
come on, come on!
please be alive!
Oh, my god.
there's no signal!
Darren!
Darren?
I shouldn't have come home.
I know the risk.
but I had no choice.
I have to know her.
dear diary, today will be different.
it has to be.
I will smile, and it will be believable.
my smile was "I'm fine, thank you."
Yes, I feel much better.
I will no longer be the sad little girl who lost her parents.
I will start fresh, be someone new.
it's the only way I'll make it through.
toast. I can make toast.
it's all about the coffee, Aunt Jenna.
is there coffee?
your first day of school, and I'm totally unprepared.
lunch money?
I'm good.
anything else?
a number two pencil? What am I missing?
don't you have a big presentation today?
I'm meeting with my thesis advisor at now.
crap!
then go. We'll be fine.
you ok?
don't start.
so gram's telling me I'm psychic.
our ancestors were from Salem, which isn't all that, I know, crazy, but she's going on and on about it, and I'm like, put this woman in a home already!
but then I started thinking, I predicted Obama and I predicted Heath Ledger, and I still think Florida will break off and turn into little resort islands.
Elena!
back in the car.
I did it again, didn't I?
I--I'm sorry, Bonnie.
you were telling me that...That I'm psychic now.
right. Ok, then predict something.
about me.
I see...
what was that?!
Oh, my god!
Elena, are you ok?
it's ok. I'm fine.
it was like a bird or something. It came out of nowhere.
really, I can't be freaked out by cars for the rest of my life.
I predict this year is going to be kick ass.
and I predict all the sad and dark times are over and you are going to be beyond happy.
major lack of male real estate.
look at the shower curtain on Kelly Beach.
she looks a hot.
can I still say "tranny mess"?
no, that's over.
ahh, find a man, coin a phrase.
it's a busy year.
he hates me.
that's not hate.
that's "you dumped me, but I'm too cool to show it," "But secretly I'm listening to Air Supply's greatest hits."
Elena. Oh, my god.
how are you?
Oh, it's so good to see you.
how is she? Is she good?
Caroline, I'm right here.
and I'm fine. Thank you.
Really?
Yes. Much better.
Oh, you poor thing.
OK, Caroline.
OK, see you guys later?
OK! - Bye.
no comment.
I'm not going to say anything.
don't take more than two in a six-hour window.
Hey, Vicki.
I knew I'd find you here with the crackheads.
Hey, Pete Wentz called.
he wants his nail polish back.
Pete Wentz, huh? How old school T. R.L of you.
Carson Daly fan?
Oh, Ty, be nice. Be nice.
that's Elena's little brother.
I know who he is.
I'll still kick his ass.
hold up. Who's this?
all I see is back.
it's a hot back.
your records are incomplete.
you're missing immunization records, and we do insist on transcripts.
please look again.
I'm sure everything you need is there.
well, you're right.
so it is.
I'm sensing Seattle, and he plays the guitar.
you're really going to run this whole psychic thing into the ground, huh? - Pretty much.
I'll be right back.
please be hot.
Whoa! Pants down, chick!
great.
it's the first day of school and you're stoned.
no, I'm not. - Where is it?
is it on you? - Stop, all right!
you need to chill yourself, all right?
chill myself? - What is that, stoner talk?
dude, you are so cool.
look, stop! I don't have anything on me. Are you crazy?
you haven't seen crazy, Jeremy!
I gave you a summer pass, but I am done watching you destroy yourself.
no, no, no, you know what?
go ahead. Keep it up. But just know that I am going to be there to ruin your buzz every time, you got it?
Jeremy, I know who you are.
and it's not this person.
so don't be this person.
I don't need this.
thank you.
you're welcome.
uh, pardon me.
is this the men's room?
Yes. um, I was just. Um... I was just...
it's a long story.
thank you.
once our home state of Virginia joined confederacy in 1861, it created a tremendous amount of tension within the state.
people in Virginia's northwest region had different ideals than those from the traditional deep south.
then virginia divided in 1863 with the northwest region joining the union.
dear diary, I made it through the day.
I must have said, "I'm fine, thanks," at least 37 times.
and I didn't mean it once.
but no one noticed.
when someone asks, "How are you"?
they really don't want an answer.
Hi, bird.
that's not creepy or anything.
that's what I thought.
you ok?
were you following me?
no, I, uh, I just... I saw you fall.
Uh-huh, and you just happened to be hanging out in a cemetery.
I'm visiting. I have family here.
Wow. Tactless.
I'm sorry. It's the fog,
it's making me foggy.
and then back there, there was this bird, and it was all very Hitchcock for a second.
that is the bird movie, right, the Hitchcock?
I'm Elena.
I'm Stefan.
I know.
we have history together.
and English and French.
right.
Thanks.
nice ring.
it's a family ring, yeah.
I'm kinda stuck with it. It's weird, huh?
no, no. It's just, I mean, there are rings and then there's that.
did you hurt yourself?
did you hurt yourself?
I don't know.
Oh! Look at that.
that is not pretty.
you ok?
you should go.
take care of that.
really, it's nothing.
I lost control today.
everything I've kept buried inside came rushing to the surface.
I'm simply not able to resist her.
working.
Thanks, Vick.
do you need another refill?
I'd love one.
please tell me you're not hooking up with my sister.
I'm not hooking up with your sister.
you're such a dick.
Hey, what's your deal?
I mean, summer you act one way and then school starts and you can't be bothered.
look, Jeremy, I really appreciate all the pharmaceuticals, but you can't keep following me around like a lost puppy.
when's the last time you had sex with a puppy?
Hey, keep it down. I don't want to tell the whole world
I deflowered Elena's kid brother.
Yeah, and deflowered and deflowered.
we hooked up a few times in a drug haze. It's over.
you gotta back off before you ruin things between me and Tyler.
Oh, come on, the guy's a total douche.
he only wants you for your ass.
yeah?
what do you want me for?
his name is Stefan Salvatore.
he lives with uncle up at the old Salvatore boarding house.
he hasn't lived here since he was a kid.
military family, so they moved around a lot.
he's a gemini, and his favorite color is blue.
you got all of that in one day?
Oh, please, I got all that between third and fourth period.
we're planning a June wedding.
I'm meeting Bonnie at the grill.
OK, have fun. Wait, I got this.
don't stay out late, it's a school night.
well done, aunt Jenna.
sorry, I was about to knock.
I wanted to apologize for my disappearing act earlier.
I know it was strange.
no worries.
I get it, blood makes you squeamish.
um, something like that.
how's your leg?
Oh, it's fine.
just a scratch, barely.
how did you know where I lived?
it's a small town.
I asked the first person I saw.
um, I thought you might want this back.
Oh, I must have dropped it.
I thank you.
don't worry, I didn't read it.
no?
why not? Most people would have.
well, I wouldn't want anyone to read mine.
you keep a journal?
Yeah, if I don't write it down, I forget it.
memories are too important.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna...
um, you don't have to stay out there.
I'm fine.
sorry, were you going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm meeting a friend.
do you want to come?
how's Elena doing?
her mom and dad died. How do you think?
she's putting on a good face, but it's only been four months.
has she said anything about me? - Oh, no.
so not getting in the middle.
you pick up the phone and call her.
I feel weird calling her.
she broke up with me.
give it more time, Matt.
more time, huh?
Hey, I'm Matt, nice to meet you.
Hi. Stefan.
so, you were born in Mystic Falls?
Mm-hmm, and moved when I was still young.
parents?
my parents passed away.
I'm sorry.
any siblings?
none that I talk to.
I live with my uncle.
so, Stefan, if you're new, then you don't know about the party tomorrow.
it's a back to school thing at the Falls.
are you going?
of course she is.
you promised.
this was an animal attack.
don't give me that. I know the game.
you tear them up enough, they always suspect an animal attack.
you said you had it under control.
and I do.
please, uncle Stefan.
mystic Falls is a different place now.
it's been quiet for years, but there are people who still remember.
and you being here, it's just going to stir things up.
it's not my intention. - Then what is?
why did you come back?
after all this time, why now?
I don't have to explain myself.
I know that you can't change what you are.
but you don't belong here anymore.
where do I belong?
I can't tell you what to do.
but coming back here was a mistake.
the battle of Willow Creek took place right at the end of the war in our very own mystic falls.
how many casualties resulted in this battle?
ms. Bennett?
um...A lot?
I'm not sure.
like a whole lot.
cute becomes dumb in an instant, Ms. Bennett.
Mr. Donovan.
would you like to take this opportunity to overcome your embedded jock stereotype?
it's ok, Mr. Tanner, I'm cool with it.
hmm. Elena?
surely you can enlighten us about one of the town's most significantly historical events?
I'm sorry, I... I don't know.
I was willing to be lenient last year for obvious reasons, Elena, but the personal excuses ended with summer break.
there were 346 casualties, unless you're counting local civilians.
that's correct.
mister...
Salvatore.
Salvatore. any relation to the original settlers here at mystic falls?
distant.
well, very good.
except, of course, there were no civilian casualties in this battle.
actually, there were 27, sir.
confederate soldiers, they fired on the church, believing it to be housing weapons.
they were wrong.
it was a night of great loss.
the founder's archives are, uh, stored in civil hall if you'd like to brush up on your facts.
Mr. Tanner.
what do you mean, you never hooked up?
people look up to me.
I have to set an example.
just admit it, Elena.
Oh, ok, so he's a little pretty.
he has that romance novel stare.
Stefan looked deep into her eyes, piercing her very soul.
Hey! you made it!
I did.
well, let's get you a drink.
well, I'm... - Oh, come on.
so where is he?
I don't know.
you tell me, you're the psychic one.
right, I forgot. Ok, so give me a sec.
grams says I have to concentrate.
wait, you need a crystal ball.
ta da.
what?
that was weird.
when I touched you, I saw a crow.
what?
a crow.
there was fog, a man.
I'm drunk.
it's the drinking. There's nothing psychic about it.
yeah? Ok, I'm gonna get a refill.
OK.
Bonnie!
I did it again, didn't it?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
you're upset about something.
no, it's Bonnie. she's...
you know what?
never mind. You're...here.
I'm here.
you know, you're kind of the talk of the town.
am I? - Mm-hmm.
mysterious new guy, oh, yeah.
well, you have the mysterious thing going, too.
twinged in sadness.
what makes you think that I'm sad?
well, we did meet in a graveyard.
right.
well, no, technically we met in the men's room.
you don't want to know, it's...It's not exactly party chit-chat.
well, I've never really been very good at, uh, chit-chat.
last spring my parents' car drove off of a bridge into the lake.
and I was in the backseat and I survived, but they didn't.
so that's my story.
you won't be sad forever, Elena.
no, Ty.
I'm not having sex against a tree.
Oh, come on, it would be hot. - For who?
no, it's not going to happen.
it's not going to happen, not here, not like this.
no. I said no.
I said no! Wow, that hurts!
Hey, leave her alone.
you know, you're starting to get on my nerves, Gilbert.
just go, Tyler, get the hell away from me.
Wow. Vicki Donovan says no.
that's a first.
I didn't need your help.
it seems like you did.
he was just drunk. - I'm drunk.
am I throwing myself at you?
no, you're worse.
you want to talk to me, get to know me, see into my soul and screw and screw and screw until you're done with me.
is that what you think?
that's what I know.
I like Bonnie, she seems like a good friend.
best friend in the world. - And Matt, he can't seem to, uh, take his eyes off of us.
Matt's that friend since childhood that you start dating because you owe it to yourselves to see if you can be more.
And?
and then my parents died, and everything changes.
anyway, Matt and I, together we just, I don't know, it wasn't, um...It wasn't...
passionate.
no.
no, it wasn't passionate.
Hey, um, are you ok?
your eye, it just, it's...
Yeah, no. It's, um, it's nothing.
um, are you thirsty?
I'm gonna get us a drink.
Jeremy?
is that you?
Jeremy?
looking for someone?
when you broke up with me, you said it was because you needed some time alone.
you don't look so alone to me.
Matt, you don't understand. It's...
that's ok, Elena.
you do what you have to do.
I just want to let you know that...
I still believe in us.
and I'm not giving up on that.
Matt.
Hey! There you are.
have you been down to the falls yet?
because they are really cool at night.
and I can show you, if you want.
I think you've had too much to drink.
well, of course I have.
so, Caroline.
you and me, it's not gonna happen.
sorry.
I was wondering who abducted you, but now I know.
is she like that with, uh, all the guys?
no.
you're fresh meat.
she'll back off eventually.
God, you gotta be kidding me!
what is it?
my brother. - The drunk one?
that would be the one.
excuse me. - Need some help?
trust me, you're not going to want to witness this.
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Jeremy, where the hell are you going?
I don't want to hear it!
Vicki? No!
Oh, my god, it's Vicki! Oh, my god!
No!
somebody help!
Vicki? Vicki, what the hell?!
what happened to her?
somebody, call an ambulance!
everybody back up, give her some space!
it's her neck. Something bit her.
she's losing a lot of blood.
put this on her neck.
Vicki, Vicki, come on, open your eyes, look at me.
what's going on?
someone else was attacked tonight, Zach, and it wasn't me.
Damon.
Hello, brother.
crow's a bit much, don't you think?
wait till you see what I can do with the fog.
When'd you get here?
well, I couldn't miss your first day at school.
your hair's different.
I like it.
it's been 15 years, Damon.
thank god.
I couldn't take another day of the Nineties.
that horrible grunge look?
did not suit you.
remember, Stefan, it's important to stay away from fads.
why are you here?
I miss my little brother.
you hate small towns.
it's boring. There's nothing for you to do.
I've managed to keep myself busy.
you know, you left that girl alive tonight.
that's very clumsy of you.
that can be a problem for you.
why are you here now?
I could ask you the same question.
however, I'm fairly certain your answer can be summed up all into one little word...
Elena.
we're gonna go Mainline Coffee, wait for news.
I gotta take Jeremy home.
Elena, there's no way I'm psychic.
I know that.
but whatever I saw, or I think I saw, I have this feeling...
Bonnie, what?
that it's just the beginning.
she took my breath away.
Elena.
she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
is it working, Stefan?
being around her, being in her world?
does it make you feel alive?
she's not Katherine.
well, let's hope not.
we both know how that ended.
tell me something, when's the last time you had something stronger than a squirrel?
I know what you're doing, Damon. It's not gonna work.
yeah? Come on. Don't you crave a little?
stop it. Let's do it. Together.
I saw a couple girls out there.
or just, let's just cut to the chase, let's just go straight for Elena!
stop it!
imagine what her blood tastes like!
I can.
I said stop!
I was impressed.
I give it a six.
missing style, but i was pleasantly surprised.
very good with the whole face thing. It was good.
you know, it's all fun and games, Damon, huh?
but wherever you go, people die.
that's a given. - Not here.
I won't allow it.
I take that as an invitation.
Damon, please.
after all these years, can't we just give it a rest?
I promised you an eternity of misery, so I'm just keeping my word.
just stay away from Elena.
Where's your ring?
Oh, yeah, sun's coming up in a couple of hours, and, poof, ashes to ashes.
relax.
it's right here.
you should know better than to think you're stronger than me.
you lost that fight when you stopped feeding on people.
I wouldn't try it again.
I think we woke Zach up. hmm.
sorry, Zach.
you ok?
I called Jenna, she's on her way.
those people in uniforms, last time I checked, they're the police.
people are going to stop giving you breaks, Jer.
they just don't care anymore.
they don't remember that our parents are dead, because they've got their own lives to deal with.
the rest of the world has moved on.
you should try, too.
I've seen you in the cemetery writing in your diary.
is that--Is that supposed to be you moving on?
mom and dad wouldn't have wanted this.
are you sober yet?
no.
keep drinking. I gotta get you home.
I gotta get me home.
why didn't he go for me?
you know, how come...
the guys that I want never want me?
I'm not touching that.
I'm inappropriate.
I always say the wrong thing.
and Elena always says the right thing.
she doesn't even try!
and he just picks her.
and she's always the one that everyone picks, for everything.
and I try so hard, and I'm never the one.
it's not a competition, Caroline.
Yeah, it is.
Vicki...
Hey.
Hey, it's ok.
you're gonna be ok.
Matt-- shh.
Hey, don't try to talk, ok?
you're fine.
vampire.
dear diary, I couldn't have been more wrong.
I thought that i could smile, nod my way through it; pretend like it would all be ok.
I had a plan.
I wanted to change who I was; create a life as someone new, someone without the past.
without the pain.
someone alive.
but it's not that easy.
the bad things stay with you.
they follow you.
you can't escape them, as much as you want to.
all you can do is be ready for the good.
so when it comes, you invite it in, because you need it.
I need it.
I know it's late.
but, uh...
I needed to know that you were ok.
you know, for months, that's all anyone's wondered about me.
if I'll be ok.
what do you tell them?
that I'll be fine.
do you ever mean it?
ask me tomorrow.
it's warmer in the house. We can talk.
would you like to come in?
Yes.
for over a century, I have lived in secret until now.
I know the risk but I have to know her.
how could you not sparkle?
because I live in the real world where vampire's burning in the sun.
but you go in the sun. - I have a ring. It protects me.
the pocket watch. Where is it?
it is supposed to be mine.
did you get the Gilbert's watch?
I can get it. - Good. We are gonna need it.
what is that? - Very important crystal.
you're the mystery guy, and I like that.
but when mystery becomes secret.
I just need you to trust me. - Trust is earned.
Oh my god, Caroline, what happened? - Nothing.
did Damon hurt you?
there are bruises all over Caroline.
I'm handling it.
the vervain could weaken him if he ingested it.
it would help you get the upper hand.
I knew I couldn't spike your drink, so I spiked hers.
five bodies are all drained off blood.
they've come back.
Where's my ring?
you won't be needing it anymore.
how long have I been here? - Three days.
what are you doing?
during the dark ages, when the vampire's actions start to expose and bring harms upon the entire race.
they will face judgement. They sort to re-educate them rather than to punish them.
you know what happened if I don't feed on blood.
you'll go weaker and weaker.
and eventually won't be able to move or speak.
in a week, your skin will desiccate and you will munmmify, and live in coffins.
unable to hurt anyone, ever.
so you are going to keep me in the basement forever.
I will ingest you and the vervain will keep you in weak.
once the interrogation starts I will move you to the family cript.
and then in 50 years we can re-evaluate.
I'm stronger than you think. - You always have been.
but you are not stronger than the vervain.
and we both know it.
I'm sorry.
then, it has to be this way.
I'm sorry, I'm almost done.
it's ok. Take your time.
I think you might be in trouble.
what did you do?
Elena saw me.
I'm a drug useing delinquent.
girls in bed doesn't really rank, sorry.
are you aware what is going on upstaires?
and you have no objections.
it could be crafty you know about it, at least he made an effort to sneak in and out.
Oh and, just so you know, I won't be home for the dinner.
so you are actually going to do it.
you're going to go out with Logan.
I'm gonna show up and torturer him. Yes.
and have you heard from Stefan?
not since he left that very vague message three days ago.
Hey, Elena, urh, I have something I have to do, I'll explain it in a few days.
have you called him?
Nope, not going to either.
and you are ok with everything?
no, I'm not ok with any of them.
I'm not gonna cry about it either.
I was gonna write my diary this morning and then I thought what I'm gonna write?
honestly, I'm not gonna be one of those pathetic girls whose world stops being because of some guy.
OK, then.
I'll be fine.
is he weak?
he's weak, but it's better seal him in the basement.
he's Damon, he's very dangeous and he still might be.
you're going to school?
I came here to live a life, it's about time I get back to that.
and Elena, if she is still speaking to me.
why haven't you called her?
what am I supposed to do? Fake another lie?
I hate lying to her, Zach, I'm not good at it.
she's already thought I'm hiding something.
what choice do you have?
you came back, because you want to live as normal life as you could.
you know this could be a part of it.
I remember the party.
Damon came behind me and he was kissing my neck or he's biting my neck?
I passed out.
it's like there's holes in my memory lately.
it's just weird. Maybe I let him bite me.
why would you do that?
can we just not talk about it?
okay? I just don't want to talk about Damon.
and I don't wannna talk about any of it.
I just want to go back to normal.
what are you doing with that candle?
nothing.
what's this?
Damon gives it to me.
or he was going to give it to me, all I know is it's mine now.
it's ugly.
get your rubby hand out of it.
the Sexy Subs Car Wash is a smile.
the football team and the band of the committed.
well, not all the band, just the one you can pull off the bikini.
I want in your face, sexy, I mean it's a fundraiser, for god's sake.
unbelievable, it is like nothing had happened.
she doesn't denial.
Hey, you know, I gonna go.
be somewhere right now.
I'm so sorry I haven't called.
no worries. I wll live.
I was dealing with Damon.
and did you?
deal with Damon? -Yes, yeah.
for four days?
you have every right be upset with me, but can I explain it all to you, please?
sure. When?
I gonna be home after school, but the Grill? At 4 o'clock?
OK.
Thanks.
Stefan. Where is Damon?
he has some serious apologize to do.
he's gone, Caroline.
when is he coming back?
he is not coming back.
I'm sorry.
this is a good thing, Caroline.
I know that.
Hey, Matt.
have you seen Stefan? -No.
if you wanna kill some time, we can rack.
come on. We haven't play for...
I will let you break.
I am full of vervain.
I've been putting it in my coffee for 16 years.
my blood will only make you worse.
Damon?
so it was your vervain. Good for you.
good for you.
family only runs so deep.
we're not family, Damon.
only in the most dysfunctional sense.
in fact, I avoided having a living, breathing, loving family because of you.
I don't guess I could talk you into bringing me a rabbit or something?
I'd settle for Stefan's diet at this point.
you know I can't do that.
you succeeded, Zach.
I'm shutting down.
you're like your grandfather.
he didn't like it when I came to visit, either.
but you don't visit, Damon.
you appear, unannounced, reminding me that this isn't my house that you're just permitting me to live here.
hell, that you're permitting me to live.
someone had to mow the lawn.
I came to say good-bye, Damon.
unlock it.
unlock the door, Zach.
keep it up, Damon.
the more energy you expend, the faster you'll go.
and there's Vicki, all nonchalant in the bathroom, like it's no big deal that they're hooking up.
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.
your brother and my sister, that's weird.
Yeah.
how late is he?
hitting the hour mark.
hope there's nothing wrong.
which means I'm not talking boy problems with you.
good.
I mean, it's not like we were ever best friends or anything.
OK.
here goes.
what do you think of Stefan?
is he a good guy?
Why? What's he done?
not any one thing.
he's just so secretive all the time.
I think there's something that he doesn't want me to know, which makes me want to know all the more.
like what? Like that he's a serial killer and he keeps a clown suit in his trunk?
no, of course not.
but what do we know about him, really?
he's great at football.
a little bit of a loner.
and as much as I hate saying it, he might be a nice guy.
so you think I'm just being paranoid?
I think you should talk to him.
talk to who?
I'm so sorry that I'm late.
what happened?
I got held up.
is everything ok?
there was this thing with my uncle.
and you couldn't call and tell me that you were going to be an hour late?
OK. You two have fun.
I'm really sorry.
it was unavoidable.
what was unavoidable?
OK.
Oh, uh, Elena, please...
no, Stefan, don't you get it?
every question gets a vague non-answer.
what is so awful that you're afraid to tell me?
I know you.
my god.
I'm sorry? - I know you. How can it be?
I think you have the wrong person, sir.
you haven't aged a day.
I'm sorry. Excuse Me.
Hey, can we-- Can I take you home?
and we can talk about it? Is that ok?
wait, what was that?
I--I don't know. Uh, nothing.
right, nothing. Ok, um... I gotta go, Stefan.
excuse me.
I tried. I want so much to make things right,
but every instinct in my body is telling me to be careful what you don't know can hurt you.
evening, sheriff.
anything?
we went over the entire west side of the lake.
all the caverns by the falls were clean, No signs of habitat.
well, they're staying in town.
we canvassed all abandoned buildings and warehouses.
there has to be a private residence.
and that much harder to locate, if not impossible.
these creatures are smart. They know how to go undetected.
well, someone who only comes out at night should eventually become obvious.
what about the watch? - I'm working on it.
I knew the Gilberts.
that watch is passed down to the men in the family.
I'd start with Jeremy.
I can't believe you really came.
you have an hour. Make it count.
you ok?
is Vicki in there?
don't answer a question with another question.
maybe. What's wrong with you?
I'm miserable.
well, you should go get something to eat.
Jenna?
Jenna?
Stefan? What are you doing here?
dinner.
Jeremy told me that chicken parmesan is one of your favorites, and I happen to be a good cook. The Italian roots demand it.
I can even make my own homemade mozzarella.
only tonight, it is unfortunately Storboboht. Sorry.
I don't know what you're trying to accomplish.
you want to know me, right?
well, I figure if you're going to dump me, you should at least, um, know who you're dumping.
so let's start with Katherine.
Stefan...
she was the most beautiful girl that I had ever met.
she had this perfect olive skin.
and she had this laugh. It was ridiculous.
I mean, her laugh made you laugh. And she was fun.
she knew how to have a good time.
but Katherine was also very impatient and entitled and selfish, and, um, and impulsive.
enter Damon.
he claims that he was with her first. I don't know.
I do know that I did some things that I'm not proud of.
and my biggest regret is not being able to make it right before she died.
I miss her, but I'm no longer crippled by her loss.
it was very nice what you did for Stefan.
very romantic.
well, I was feeling romantic.
look what I found.
Elena Gilbert, "Take one tablet every 4 to 6 hours, as needed for pain."
those are left over from the car accident.
so she won't miss them.
no, not with that. That's an antique.
I feel like we're always getting high.
that's the beauty of choice.
well, then let's choose not to.
I mean, we don't have to be high all the time, right?
I really hope you're not one of those guys who, now that we're together, tries to change everything about me.
no.
good.
I'm an avid reader, a huge Fitzgerald fan, The great gatsby, his masterpiece.
but I'm no snob.
I love some good Grisham.
I think Seinfeld is the best American television show for the past 50 years, but I love Lucy is all-time.
the loving cup" episode was the best, I think.
huge Scorsese fan.
I can watch Taxi Driver over and over again.
here, let me.
as far as music, it's pretty much across the board.
um, Dylan, Hendrix, Patsy, Willie.
Oh, Kanye. you know what, I even like that one Miley song.
easy.
I didn't say anything.
Hey, this is for the Garlic Bread, right?
because I'm not eating garlic unless you agree to, too.
are you kidding? I love garlic.
you ok? Um...
Yeah. Think so.
your face...
I--I, uh, I think I got something in my eye.
Stefan.
Stefan!
um, I think that my paranoia has turned into full-blown hallucinations.
part of your charm.
Caroline.
Caroline.
no, Tiki, do not do the one-piece, ok?
I've seen it on you. Trust me.
Yeah, but you're going for stripper pole vibe this year.
Caroline.
Yeah, maybe we should wash the cars in slow motion.
no.
Caroline.
what? Oh, um, no, sorry.
um, so I'll just see you tomorrow.
Two-piece. Ok, bye.
God!
I bet you're feeling pretty good about yourself, aren't you?
not particularly.
you won.
you got the bad guy.
now nothing could come between you and Elena.
except the truth.
the lies will catch up to you, Stefan.
as long as you keep lying to yourself about what you are.
the beauty of you in there and me out here is that I can walk away.
no friend discounts.
no freebies.
no pay laters.
we are not running a charity here.
no, we are not.
the event is called sexy suds, you know.
did we just get scolded?
and judged, yeah.
I'm sorry,
but I guess you're going to have to take that off.
I think you have to go first.
OK.
OK, um--sorry, so not sexy.
I disagree.
uh-uh, no.
none of that tortured pining stuff.
I'm just observing.
tiki. This one's yours.
why do I always get the homely os?
just to be clear, your car's a P.O.S.
I mean, we can wash it, but it's still a P.O.S.
you don't have to be rude.
rude is uglying up the road with that junk.
wet and wild, Tik.
all proceeds are going to the school's athletic department still healing from the tragic death of their football coach william tanner.
the citizens of Mystic Falls coming together in support of one of their own.
cut it.
classy.
thank you.
but you're still going to video the girls in Bikinis, right?
we, 53% of americans watch the news with the sound off.
thank you for dinner.
I had a nice time.
do you remember the last time we were in the school parking lot?
Nope.
doesn't ring a bell.
Really? - Nada.
especially not having sex in the minivan.
that was a good day.
what?
you're getting soap in that.
Oh, it's fine.
I noticed at Damon has one, too.
is there a story behind it?
Yeah, it's the family crest from the italian renaissance.
what's the stone?
it's called lapus lazuli.
you should really take it off.
I could put it in my bag.
no, it's-- it's fine, really.
Thanks, though.
OK.
I'm gonna get some towels.
OK.
Hey, we're out of towels and those shimmy things.
I'll go get some more. Mind the money.
Caroline.
Caroline, help me.
Caroline.
help me.
help me.
that'll be $20.
I saw you last night.
you were talking to a friend of mine, at the Grill?
well, I--I thought it was somebody I knew.
Stefan Salvatore.
Nah, it can't be.
it's just my mind playing tricks on me.
where do you think you'd seen him before?
when I first moved here, I stayed at the Salvatore boarding house.
Stefan was just passing through to visit his uncle.
I mean, none of us knew he was even here until the attack.
the attack?
his uncle got killed.
mauled by an animal in the woods.
his uncle, Zach?
Mm-mmm. Joseph.
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't think I'm familiar with the story.
Oh, how could you?
I mean, this happened years ago.
grandpa, you gotta go. Mom wants you home.
OK?
Ah.
he wasn't bugging you, was he?
he's a little alzy-heimer.
no, he was sweet.
Hey, sir,
I'm sorry. Um, are you sure that the man that you saw, that you knew, his name was Stefan Salvatore?
Yes.
I remember his ring and his brother Damon? - Yeah.
Stefan and Damon Salvatore.
when was this?
it was early June, 1953.
Yeah.
june, 1953.
Caroline finally freed you, huh?
uh, I don't know where she went.
she abandoned me.
Hey, I realized earlier, I had no idea that your family was from Italy.
no?
last name Salvatore didn't do it for you?
right.
Duh.
are there any other Salvatores in mystic falls?
my uncle Zach.
where did everyone else go?
kinda just spread out.
Why?
I'm just trying to learn more about you.
where are you taking me?
we can't hide out in your room all the time.
welcome to my other favorite party place.
what, the cemetary?
Yeah. It's cool, huh?
yo, Vick!
what's up, Jared?
you baby-sitting, Donovan?
this is Jeremy. He's cool.
smoke up.
your car was done an hour ago.
you're saying that out loud why?
Hi. Elena, right?
I think I met you once when you were 9.
your emotional maturity level when we were together.
Ouch. Here I thought we were making progress.
is he enough in your good graces that I can ask him for a favor?
if I do her a favor, will I get back in your good graces?
uh, a very reluctant maybe to both.
done. Wait. One condition.
dinner, tonight, your house.
fine. But you're eating leftovers.
what do you need?
do you have access to old news stories, say, fifties?
Yeah, at the station.
between the archives and the internet, we pretty much have everything.
I have this report way past due.
it'd be a life saver.
heading there now.
let's go.
if anyone asks, you don't know where I went.
I don't want Caroline to know that I left.
Caroline, help me.
help me.
Caroline.
Damon?
Damon?
Damon?
Oh, my god!
what is this?
how did I know that you were here?
because I wanted you to.
very, very badly.
let me out of here.
please.
you bit me.
you liked it.
remember?
why do I keep remembering the same things, but in different ways?
you remember what I want you to remember.
and now that the vervain has passed out of your system, you won't remember what you're about to do.
what am I about to do?
you're gonna open the door.
you're gonna open the door.
No! No!
get out of here.
run!
run!
sweeper duty.
what?
we have to clean the pavement.
it's a car wash.
by definition, the pavement's clean.
but not dry.
and I'm doing this why?
Caroline bailed, so that leave me in charge.
fabulous.
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie!
what just happened?
you were in some kind of a trance.
did I do this?
I think so, yes.
nobody else saw, did they?
don't tell anybody.
please.
we digitized all our archives last year.
you can pull all the remote footage right up on screen.
what is it exactly you're looking for?
an incident from 1953, if it even happened at the old Salvatore boarding house.
sorry, one second.
yeah?
fire?
all right, I'll be right there.
I gotta go.
you believe there's actual news to cover in this town?
all right, use keywords to search the database.
it's pretty easy to navigate.
and Brady down in tech will help you out with anything you need.
could you put in a good word for me with Jenna?
you got it.
all right. Good luck.
what?
I'm stoned in a cemetery.
they don't mind, they're dead.
you know what? I gotta take this up a notch.
Hey, Tony.
nice.
Vickies from Vicki.
well, thank you, Elena Gilbert, whoever you are.
you took those from the house?
she wasn't using it.
she's gonna notice if they're gone. That's not cool.
it's no big deal, Jer.
Yeah, it kinda is, Vick.
damn, dude.
Vicki brought the party police.
shut up, Tony.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad.
well, what are we doing, partying in a cemetery - With a bunch of losers? - Those are my friends.
they're waste of space small-town lifers.
yeah? What am I?
you're different, Vick.
no, you are.
you're the kid with the big house who's acting out because his parents died.
guess what-- You'll get over it.
you will pull yourself together, move on, and one day tell your kids stories about your dark period growing up.
and I'll still be here, waiting tables at the grill, partying at the cemetery with a bunch of waste of space small-town lifers.
look-- go home, Jeremy.
if I want to feel like crap about myself, I'll just go back to Tyler.
Hey, have you seen Elena?
no, not for a while.
you think she went home?
not sure. - Thanks.
Hey.
I'm not saying this for you.
I'm saying it for her.
but she's big on trust.
so whatever you're holding back from her, the more you try to hide it, the more she won't stop till she figures it out.
this is Michael Fell reporting to you from the Salvatore boarding house, where a brutal animal attack has ended in tragedy.
OK, they're bringing out the bodies.
see if you can get closer.
is that the nephew?
I didn't see you at the car wash.
left early.
honey, are you ok?
anything you want to talk about?
is it a boy thing?
mom, if I want to talk boys, I'll call dad.
at least he's successfully dating one.
dear diary, I'm not a believer.
people are born, they grow old, and then they die.
that's the world we live in.
there's no magic, no mysticism, no immortality.
there's nothing that defies rational thought.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I know, dear.
Logan?
Logan?
people are supposed to be who they say they are.
and not lie or hide their true selves.
what are you doing here?
Oh, hey, man. Just looking for the bathroom.
it's not possible.
I'm not a believer, I can't be.
but how can I deny what's right in front of me?
someone who never grows old...
june, 1953.
never gets hurt...
Oh, my god, your hand!
is it deep? How bad is it?
soone who changes in ways that can't be explained...
Hey, um, are you ok?
your eye.
your face.
girls bitten... what is that?
Oh, my god, what happened to you?
it's nothing! - Bodies drained off blood...
did she say what kind of animal it was?
she said it was a vampire.
Donovan?
no, I'm good.
not it. not it.
not it.
Ah, Vicki.
Hey, man, you ok?
come here.
come here.
you don't look good.
come closer.
I have something that I have to tell you.
I got you, I got you.
it's ok. It's ok.
what are you?
for over a century, I have lived in secret, until now. I know the risk, but I have to know her.
Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
our love for Katherine wasn't real, Damon.
I'm gonna bring her back.
I'm Anna. -- Uh, Jeremy.
you know, my great-grandfather actually showed me a journal. He had written all of this creepy stuff about vampires.
your turn.
any sad relationship stories?
fell in love, married young...wife died.
I've never been in your room before.
who am I to you?
you are not Katherine.
why do I look like her?
you were adopted.
Aah! -- How you doin' in there?
Stefan, who was that man in the road?
I don't know. Do you remember anything else about him?
I wish. I never really saw his face.
he was wearing a hoodie.
all I can remember is that there was these black boots coming towards me.
I brought some vervain for, um... for you and Jenna.
and, um, I made this bracelet for Jeremy, few extra on for friends.
you can put it in jewelry, or you can even put it in food or drink, but as long as it's in you or on you, a vampire can not control you.
Wow. So much should remember.
I know, but there's another vampire in town, so until we find out who it is and what he wants, we have to be careful.
Hey.
it's gonna be $22.
Elena, I need the money!
uh, here. Come in. Just put it on the table.
Hi.
um, keep the change.
Thanks.
and you have yourself a good night.
what are you lookin' for, Damon?
not your concern.
no, but putting Elena in harm's way, -- that is my concern. -- Heh heh.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about Atlanta.
Oh, yeah. Elena and I had a blast.
I get it.
you're just bitter because one of us gets to be with the person that we love, and poor Katherine is just out of reach.
unless there's another way for you to get into that tomb.
is that what Bree said?
you're pathetic when you're fishing.
you're transparent when you're deflecting.
don't you school?
surprised? It's a good essay.
your thoughts are clear, and your argument is well laid out.
it's just, uh, you don't actually think the are vampires in Mystic Falls.
no. I mean, I think statistically there's been more animal attacks, mystious deaths, uh, people gone missing, more than any other place in the whole commonwealth of Virginia.
it's conjecture, but creative, which is why you got the "A."
I just wouldn't get too, uh, caught up in the whole conspiracy theory of it all.
Ah, I won't.
all right.
Oh, uh, Jeremy, the source that you cited for the 1860s info, uh, Jonathan Gilbert...
uh, my ancestor's journal?
I'd really like to see that sometime.
Really?
a first-person account of the civil war? That's like, uh, porn for a history teacher.
you think my essay's creative, wait till you get a load of this thing.
thank you.
it's so pretty.
thank you.
God, it'll go with, like, everything.
at's the occasion?
no occasion. Just a little friend gift.
lesbian friend necklace?
cause we're freaky like that?
your friendship is important to me.
why are you being so mushy?
because you've been avoiding me, and I wanted you to know that whatever is going on with you and Matt, it's ok.
I was gonna talk to you about that.
I was, but there's just not much to say.
we've hung out a couple times.
that's it, but...
I just feel like we've peeked as friends.
this is weird.
I shouldn't be talking you about this.
it's weird. It's weird, right?
it's a little weird, but...
if it's what you and Matt want, then it's not about me.
but it's all about you.
Matt's not over you, and we all know it.
I'm with Stefan now.
Matt understands that.
he know he has to move on.
Matt Donovan. What do you know?
Ben Mckittrick. What's up, man?
rough season, bud.
Yeah. It's kind of hard to recover when you have to forfeit half your games.
you gonna be workin' here?
Yep, followin' in your footsteps, minus the state championship.
well, can't all be football Gods.
Yeah.
so what's the plan? Cook line?
busboy.
I don't believe you're adopted.
I never saw that coming. And it gets weirder. I looked at my brith certificate.
it lists Biranda and Grayson Gilbert as my birthparents.
none of it makes any sense.
which is why you should ask Jenna.
first of all, the Elena I know would always want the real truth, good or bad.
and second of all, you just found out your boyfriend is a vampire, so unless your birthparents are aliens...
how bad could it be?
Ah, ok, look, I have to go to the store.
my outfit for the dance is severely lacking accessories.
OK, I'll pay the bill.
OK. Bye.
Bye.
what do you want from me?
I think we need a fresh start.
you tried to kill me.
but I didn't, and if I wanted to, I would have.
does that not count for anything?
you know, I can start fires with my mind.
fires kill vampires, right?
just stay the hell away from me.
everything ok over here?
Yeah, we're fine.
I wasn't talkin' to you.
thank you.
anytime, Bonnie.
wait. You remember me?
I didn't graduate that long ago.
you're makin' me feel old.
sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean that. I just... I didn't know you knew me.
I always know a pretty face.
hello.
Hello, Elena.
Hey, who's this?
you hit me with your car.
is that a new one?
you got away from me.
you won't next time.
why me? What does he want with me, a... and if he's trying to kill me, then why call first?
that's because we're predators, Elena.
we hunt. We stalk.
it's often as exciting as the kill.
I want you to take this.
this is Jeremy's pocket watch.
how did you get it?
I took it from Damon, who took it from Logan, who must have taken it from you.
what happened to it?
well, it's not just a watch.
it's a... it's a sort of compass, but it points to vampires.
why did my father have it?
Gilberts were one of the founding families, and back in 1864, they were among those who sought to eradicate the vampires.
the compass was used to find us.
did you know them?
Yes.
I want you to keep this.
that way, you'll know if you're ever in danger.
I've never seen you in such a mess.
don't talk smack.
I mean, I just thought that you told everyone else what to do.
well, I do that, too, but if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself.
you know, like that we're hanging out.
who knew... you and me?
well, who knew you could be fun?
so what are you wearing to this dumb dance, anyway?
should we color-coordinate?
uh, I'm not goin'.
why not?
I gotta work, bussin' tables at the Grill.
since when are you a busboy?
it's a job.
you know, some of us have to work, Caroline.
with our mom in and out, things are tight, so...
I didn't mean it like that.
I just meant that I didn't know you had a job.
well, I do.
I gotta go.
Hey.
how'd it go?
what?
the paper.
Oh. I got an "A."
thanks for the articles. They really helped.
cool. So what'd he say about the vampires?
did he believe it?
I don't even believe it. It's just a paper, Anna.
anyways, I, uh... I gotta get going.
uh, hey, um...
d... do you wanna do something later, maybe?
uh, sorry. I'm stuck on punch duty at the school dance.
Oh. How'd you get stuck with that?
well, I'm failin' English, so I copped a plea.
maybe, you know, tomorrow or something.
I'm being pushy again, aren't I?
Heh.
well, thanks for the help. I'll see you around.
spoke to the insurance company.
car's totaled.
you can keep using mine from now.
so you're coming to the dance?
Alaric asked me to help chaperone.
why didn't you tell me, Jenna?
your mom was gonna do it eventually.
I never thought I'd have to.
if my mom were here right now and I asked, she'd tell me the truth.
your dad was about to leave the office one night when this girl showed up.
she was 16, a runaway, and about to give birth.
he delivered her baby, and he gave her a place to stay, but a few days later, she disappeared.
and there you were.
your parents were trying so hard to have a baby.
I... it just wasn't happening.
all Miranda ever wanted was to be a mom.
well, why were my parents' names on the birth certicate?
your dad was a doctor, Elena.
he took care of it.
they didn't wanna lose you, so they kept it quiet, told as few people as possible, but if anyone ever wanted proof, they had documentation.
what else do you know about her?
the girl.
just her name.
Isabelle.
you got the hair right.
why are you bringing me dad's journal?
cause you were looking for it.
and why would I want it?
gee, I don't know, Damon.
maybe you wanna do a little bit of posthumous bonding.
go ahead. Enjoy it. Read it.
I have nowhere in it does it say anything about Katherine or the tomb or how to open it.
I'm not surprised.
man could barely spell his own name.
I'm really sorry that it won't be of any help with your diabolical plan, the sequel.
you know, I could help you.
you, help me?
Aw, I don't know.
seems a little unnatural.
I'll do anything to get you out of this town, even release Katherine.
what about the other 26 vampires?
no, no, no. They can't come.
they have to stay put, but Katherine, I would consider that.
what are you doin'? Hmm?
what's your angle?
think about it.
why would I trust you?
see that's your problem, Damon.
you apply all of your shortcomings to everybody else.
if history's any indication, there's only one liar among us.
Hey, Jenna.
Stefan's phone. How may I help you?
where is he?
he's on his way to you, forgot his phone.
thank god. This compass was spinning.
Stefan must be here. Thank you.
you're welcome.
Aah!
are you ok?
are you ok?
OK.
how did he get in?
he was invited in.
he posed as a pizza delivery guy last night.
well, he gets points for that.
did he say what he wanted?
no. He was too busy trying to kill me.
and you have no idea who this is?
no.
don't look at me like that.
I told you we had company.
you think there's more than one?
we don't know.
Damon, he was invited in.
then we go get him tonight.
you up for it?
what do I have to do?
let your boyfriend take you to the dance.
we'll see who shows up.
that's a bad idea.
till we get him, this house isn't safe. For anyone who lives in it.
it's worth a shot.
I'll do it.
I'll be with the two of you. I'll be safe.
Hey, look at you.
I figured I'd stand out less if I dressed up.
Heh heh. Liar.
OK, I'm a sucker for the decade dance.
I went to school here, you know.
they do the sixties and seventies, too, FYI.
Oh. Can't wait.
can I get you a drink?
I hear the punch is real boss.
Heh.
having fun?
no, but this took about 2 hours, so I'm at least staying half of that.
what's Damon doing here?
he wanted to come.
I promise. He'll behave.
so what is this, like, a threesome now, you and the Salvatore brothers?
no, but if I'm gonna be with Stefan, then I have to learn to tolerate Damon.
it's not like I can kill him.
there's a thought.
Mmm. I'll help.
I'm really starting to see a change in Jeremy. Finally.
uh, losing someone you love so suddenly, the, uh... the trauma and the grief there are some of the tougher things I'll face in life.
from someone who knows.
you have no idea what happened?
that's the hard part, not knowing.
is it ok to talk about your wife?
Heh. There's not much to talk about.
there must be impossible to deal with, not having any answers.
I'd be lying to you if I told you it didn't keep me up at night.
wondering why, by who.
maybe one day.
hope so.
I hope so.
Hi, Bonnie.
wanna dance?
I'm out of here.
please give me another chance.
back off, Damon.
where did they go?
I don't know.
What'd you say to 'em?
I was perfectly polite.
would you like to dance?
I would love to.
may I have is dance?
shouldn't you guys be able to sense each other or something?
no. Doesn't work that way.
see him anywhere?
not unless he has a Pompadour.
Heh. Wow. Was not one of the better fashion trends.
come on. I'm sure you looked great back then.
are there pictures?
no. Burned. Buried.
seriously, what was it like, the fifties?
cause in my mind, I have this picture of somewhere between "American Bandstand," and "Grease."
it's all varsity sweaters and milkshakes.
well, that and, you know, Mccarthyism and segregation and nuclear arms race.
OK, but there were poodle skirts.
there were poodle skirts.
you're so teaching me how to do the hand jive.
no. That's not gonna happen.
Ooh!
you neglected to mention this was a theme party.
what are you doin' here?
well, seeing you're also neglected to invite me, I took matters into my own hands.
you're doin' that thing again.
what thing would that be?
that thing where you pretend we're dating, even though we're not.
Oh, you mean stalking. Yeah.
Heh. Get over yourself.
come on. I've never been to a school dance before.
humor me.
let's sit up there.
be a little more obvious, Bonnie.
don't rain on my hot-guy parade.
what? It's just a drizzle.
Ben Mckittrick? Really?
he's hot.
he's a washed-up jock who pours drinks for a living.
you could do way better.
Hey.
what's up?
Yeah, I don't recognize you.
how'd you get roped into chaperoning?
Alaric Saltzman.
I'm the new history teacher.
Ah, the, uh, cursed faculty position.
so I've been told.
Salvatore, as in, uh, Stefan?
he's my little brother.
I'm his legal guardian, hence the chaperoning.
I hear he's very bright, not that I've had a chance to see for myself.
well, his attendance record's a little spotty.
family drama.
no parents?
mm, it's just the two of us now.
you, uh... you live here your whole life?
on and off.
travel a bit.
Really? Where?
around the states?
Heh. I'm sorry.
I'm nosy. I... I don't mean to pry.
look, it was nice meeting you.
you, too.
enjoy the rest of the dance.
tonight was so much better on paper.
Ah, you're just feeling sorry for yourself.
go and talk to him.
be bold and fearless.
Yeah, this coming from the girl who's been eye stalking the bartender.
you're right.
Hi.
twice in one day.
lucky me.
I'm proving something to my friend.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
that you don't have to sit around and wait for a guy to come up to you.
does that mean that you're asking me out on a date?
does that mean you want me to?
well, what did you have in mind?
do you like karaoke?
no.
but I would really like to go on a date with you.
Seriously?
is that for me?
do you see anyone else in the vicinity?
do you need something?
are you mad at me or something?
no, Care. I'm not mad. I...
well, then why are you being so weird?
I'm not. I'm working.
you're avoiding.
no. I have a table to clean.
you know, that's the kind of thing that washed-up jocks do to make a living.
you don't go to school here.
you know, you don't have to help.
Oh, I don't mind.
it's fun.
Oh, um, yeah. Before I forget, can I borrow your anctor's journal?
Why?
you said I could read it.
uh, I don't have it.
Oh. Obviously you didn't bring it here, uh, but I can walk you home.
no. I mean, I gave it to my history teacher.
wait. Why did you give it to him?
because he wanted to read it.
you know, you shouldn't be giving that to just anybody.
but I should give it to you?
loan... Loan it to me.
well, I loaned it to Mr. Saltzman.
maybe he's in his classroom. We can get it back.
what's the big deal with the stupid journal?
your eye.
um, there's something in it.
forget it. I gotta go.
maybe he's not gonna show.
you mean we did all this dancing for nothing?
Ahh. The horror.
I'm really sorry for all this.
it's my choice.
I decided to be here.
I officially signed up for it, so I don't wanna hear you apologizing anymore.
show me how it's done in the fifties.
uh, no.
come on. One move?
now you remember that, because it's never gonna happen again.
what a you doing here?
trying to get the journal, as in sticking to the plan, something you're not doing.
leave the girl alone.
I like her.
she looks like Katherine.
she's not Katherine.
OK, Katherine is in the tomb.
I know, but until we open that tomb, I got her to play with.
don't be stupid.
that girl is with the Salvatore brothers.
they don't scare me. They never have.
please, no. Don't do this.
you're gonna ruin everything.
you got nothing to worry about.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
you will get what you came for.
just let me have my fun.
she looks like Katherine.
you really can't take him anywhere, can you?
uh, no.
the back corner.
get Damon.
what did I do?
where is he?
I was getting a soda, and then this guy gave me his hoodie.
Hello, Elena.
here's what you're going to do.
there's an exit door behind you.
you have 5 seconds.
no. - Or your brother dies.
I can snap his neck so fast I bet there's not even a witness.
start walking.
don't you dare touch him.
keep walking.
through the door.
Ahh!
Yaah!
Hey, dickhead.
nobody wants to kill you. Just wanna talk.
now you feel like talking?
screw you.
wrong answer.
why are you doing this?
because it's fun.
what do you want with Elena?
she looks like Katherine.
you knew Katherine?
Oh. You thought you were the only ones.
you don't even remember me.
tell me how to get in the tomb. Hmm?
no.
Uhh!
the grimoire. -- Where is it?
check the journal. The journal.
it's Jonathan's journal.
jonathan Gilbert's.
who else is working with you?
who else is there?
no.
you're gonna have to kill me.
what do we... how are you gonna find the others now?
he had to die.
but...
Elena, he's been invited in.
go. I got this.
Hey.
what were you doing?
looking for Ms. Hilden.
why are you in Mystic Falls?
I got a job as a teacher.
do you know what I am? - You're my student's brother.
is everything you're telling me the truth?
Yes.
then forget we had this conversation.
there's no way that idiot was working alone.
you are.
so the grimoire...
that was Emily's, right?
that's what you need to reverse the spell.
when the founding families burned her, they took her things, and you were hoping that dad's journal would tell you where it is.
look at you putting the pieces together.
good for you.
I was half-right.
well, it's out there now.
let the games begin.
my offer still stands.
Yeah, with some hidden caveats, no doubt.
no. Nothing hidden about it.
no lies. No deception.
I'm there when you open up that tomb, you and Katherine go, and the other 26 vampires die.
if I agree... -- I'll help you.
why should I trust you? -- Because I'm your brother.
no, that's not gonna cut it.
because I want you gone.
OK.
look, I said something stupid.
I'm sorry, but I wasn't even talking about you.
Yes, you were, Caroline.
Ben could easily be me.
we're just alike.
that's not true.
are you seriously mad about this?
Matt, you know me.
OK, I say stupid things without thinking, and then I have to apologize and take it back, and...
I'm a terrible, awful person, but I'm working on it.
look, can we just not do this right now?
OK.
when do you get off?
look, this thing we've got, it's nice, and it feels really good, and I know you wanna take the next step.
how do you know that?
have you even asked me?
I'm... I'm not over Elena.
I mean, I don't know if I am, but if we go there, then it could mess things up, and we might lose this, and this is the only good thing I've got going for me right now.
so if it doesn't work, I'll just disappoint you and hurt you, and I don't wanna do that.
well, big problem, Matt, because you took the next step all by yourself, and you played the whole thing out in your head, and you decided to bail before even giving it a shot.
so this really great thing that we have, don't worry about losing it, 'cause it's already gone.
thank you.
I needed that.
well, thank you for... for coming.
I... I really appreciate it.
you made the evening much more...
well, you made it, period.
I'm glad I could help.
and thank you for putting up with all that wife talk.
I... I gotta stop doin' that.
it doesn't bode well for dating.
is that what this was, a date?
no, definitely not a date.
Oh.
but Friday...
you, me, and dinner and a movie, that could be a date.
how 'bout it?
works for me.
Heh.
uh, you can talk about your wife all you want.
it's gonna take time to heal.
we should just be ourselves.
still, I think I'll keep the Isabelle talk to a minimum.
Yeah. That was her name.
where was Isabelle from?
Virginia. I mean, not too...not too far from here, actually.
care, get in the truck.
what?
this'll never work.
doin' ok?
is it weird if I say yes?
is it true?
I should feel more upset or scared or something, but I feel kind of exhilarated.
it's the adrenaline.
you'll crash soon enough.
Yeah, I guess.
I fought back tonight.
it felt good.
I wish you didn't have to fight at all.
still...
I need to tell you something, and I don't know how you're gonna feel about it.
what?
I told Damon that I'd help him get into that tomb to get Katherine back.
but it was a lie.
I let him believe that he could trust me.
well, then why would you be worried about telling me?
because he can be very persuasive, and you two have bonded lately.
that doesn't mean I trust him.
it's gonna take a lot more than just a road trip and a rescue for me to forget who Damon is and everyting he's done.
I don't wanna be his enemy, Elena, but I can't let him do it.
then don't, and I'll help you, whatever it takes.
OK?
OK.
come here.
don't sneak up on me.
you love it.
Where's Noah?
his obsession got the best of him, and so did the Salvatore brothers.
they killed him?
tortured and staked.
you're not very upset.
I warned him, Ben, and he was just gonna screw everything anyway.
let's be honest. He wasn't exactly an asset.
how'd you do?
Oh, the witch is totally crushing on me.
did you get the journal?
no, but I know where it is, and I'll get it.
for over a century, I have lived in secret until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
Elena, She's a dead ringer For Katherine.
our love for Katherine wasn't real, Damon.
it was real for me.
I'm going to bring her back.
there's a tomb underneath the church.
a spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.
tell me how to get in the tomb.
the grimoire. - Where is it?
check the journal. Jonathan Gibert's.
the grimoire. It was Emily's, right?
that's what you need to reverse the spell.
I'll help you.
you just couldn't live without me, huh?
your eye!
Where'd she go?
Where'd who go? - Anna.
Elena!
I wouldn't.
don't try to escape.
don't even move.
do you uerstand?
I understand.
Seriously?!
I told her not to move!
I did that eye thing you taught me.
you forgot the lesson about vervain.
she takes a vampire venom, duh!
who are you? What do you want?
doesn't matter.
Bonnie?
Oh, my god!
Anna took Elena.
Yeah, I got that from your 600 voicemails.
Damon, all night long, every single street in town, I've been searching.
what if your blood hasn't passed out of her system?
well, then at least you know you'll see her again.
please.
what do you know?
you were with Anna. You at least know where she's living.
just tell me where I can find her.
Nope.
you can go.
really.
you know, all I can remember is hating you.
there might have been a time when that was different, but your choices have erased anything good about you.
but see, I also know that you have just as much reason to hate me.
this all began with me.
Katherine got taken away from you because of me.
and I'm sorry.
apology accepted.
so please, just tell me what you know.
huh.
it's Elena, Damon.
if you know something... tell me.
I mean this sincerely.
I hope Elena dies.
Bonnie.
Elena?
Oh, you're ok!
my head... - Come here.
Oh, my god! Ben is a...
Shh. They can hear.
I was so stupid!
Oh, he had all of us fooled.
what's going on? Why are we here?
it must have something to do with the tomb and Emily's spell book.
spell book?
Damon said that it could be used to open the tomb.
why didn't I know about any of this?
I was trying to keep you out of it, hoping it would never come to this.
come to what?
they need a witch to break the spell and let the vampires out.
no way. - I know...
you're wasting your time.
I'm not going to help you.
that's why she's here.
motivation for you to behave...
you know, you shouldn't be so desperate.
you made it too easy.
she wants to talk to you.
Elena Gilbert.
you really are Katherine's doppelganger.
you must have the Salvatore boys reeling.
who are you?
I'm Anna.
your brother may have mentioned me.
I mean, we're, like, practically dating.
ten kegs?
you know how much damage we could do with ten kegs?
Duke's got it all hooked up.
Duke's a douche.
Yeah, a douche with ten kegs.
aka, my new best friend.
what's the problem, Gilbert?
don't have one, Lockwood.
Yeah, I didn't think so.
you ever get bored of it? - Of what?
yourself?
keep laughing, buddy.
Hey, Jeremy.
where is Elena?
I have been texting her and Bonnie all day about Duke's party.
uh, she went somewhere with Stefan.
I am so not going to be one of those girls who disappears just because she has a new boyfriend.
who is Duke?
some guy that graduated a couple years ago.
and he throws a party every time he comes home from Duke.
wait, Duke goes to Duke?
his real name is Bob or something.
he's a total ass. But he buys the beer.
maybe you should come.
uh, yeah. I don't think so.
no, seriously. Everyone goes.
even quiet loner little brothers.
think about it.
Hey! - Hey.
so I have a speech.
it is fully scripted and well-rehearsed.
are you ready for it?
you wrote a speech? - Yes.
it's a "You kissed me and I don't want things to be weird" speech.
it's pre-emptive.
pre-emptive.
Yeah, you know, in case you were having second thoughts or regrets or were, like, ooged out...
Ooged, huh?
can I just get on with the speech part?
Yeah, go for it.
so I know that you don't think that this is going to work out between us.
I just want to let you know that right here and right now, I'm offering you an out.
like an escape clause.
why are you giving me an escape clause?
I don't want to make assumptions about what it is we are doing here.
got it.
so, if you would like to exercise it, just let me know.
I'm good, but thanks.
OK.
good.
Yeah. So...
see you for Duke's Tonight. - Yeah.
yes?
hi there.
I'm looking for Bonnie.
she's not here.
Oh, do you know when she would...
never.
you have quite an opinion for someone who doesn't know me.
you got some nerve knocking on a Bennett witch's door and asking her for anything.
What'd I do?
spirits talk, Mr. Salvatore, and so does my granddaughter.
you are no friend to us.
now get off my porch.
step outside and say that.
I am not Bonnie.
you don't want to mess with me.
Bonnie's not going to open the tomb.
Oh, I think she will.
do you really want Katherine out that bad?
trust me.
no one I know wants to see that girl again.
except Damon, the lovestruck idiot.
then what is it?
or who is it?
my mother's in there.
Katherine couldn't help herself.
she just had toyed around with both of the Salvatore brothers.
and when she got caught, so did my mother.
I watched Jonathan Gilbert take her away.
I'm sorry.
you really mean that, don't you?
Yeah, I think we'll skip the dead mom bonding so you can start serving a purpose.
which is what?
leverage.
this belong to you? Ah, ah.
hmm.
Elena, are you ok?
she's fine, for now.
tell me you have the grimoire and she'll stay fine.
I can get it.
which means your brother has it.
and I have the witch.
so one of you had better meet me in the very public town square in 30 minutes, so we can safely discuss how fun it's going to be to work together.
go ahead.
grovel again. Oh, wait, no.
I don't care.
I'm leaving.
keep them buttoned down.
compulsion won't work.
just use violence. - Right.
I got that.
sit. Behave.
you're the key to this, literally.
the one who opens the door.
tell me, how long have you been a witch?
is there anything to drink here?
are you offering?
there's water on the nightstand.
Hey. Can I have a sip?
Whoa!
come back in, shut the door!
don't hurt her!
don't make me!
lock it.
Anna!
Hey, what, uh, what happened to you last night?
sorry, I had to leave.
I told your sister to tell you.
Oh, I haven't seen her.
well, I gotta run, so...
Hey, do you want to go to a party tonight?
do I what?
the guy that's throwing it is a total douche, but it's, uh, it's supposed to be fun.
I figured, you know, safety in numbers.
so you're finally ready to go out with me, are you?
it's been a while since I've been to a party, and I kind of want to get back out there.
and not be such a loner.
and, uh, I like you.
you're fun, and you're also kind of strange and lurky, but, uh, I guess I like that, too.
so, yeah, you should come to the party. With me.
it's in the woods by that old cemetery.
Oh.
it's there, huh?
that sounds cool.
uh, I'll meet you.
Oh... ok! Great!
cool.
OK!
got a hot date, or are you just planning on nabbing the entire Gilbert family?
a party, right next to the old cemetery.
isn't that nice of them?
lots of warm bodies for starving vampires.
I told you. I work alone.
Yeah, so do I.
but you're minus a witch and I'm minus spell book.
so what do you say?
Stefan will come after you, You know that.
for messing with Elena.
then he won't be too happy if I kill her when I don't get what I want.
when do you want to do this?
God, it's like 1864 all over again.
you Salvatores are truly pathetic when it comes to women.
tonight. After sundown.
meet at the church.
witches don't have eternal life, right?
so you guys can die.
Yeah, we can die.
Ah.
that sucks.
Stefan!
let's get outside.
when the sun goes down, leave town.
if I ever see you again, I will kill you.
how did you know where we were?
many things can fuel a witch's power.
worry, anger.
after Stefan told me that they had taken you, I had a lot of both.
simple locator spell was easy after that.
I'm sorry about all of this.
not as sorry as they're gonna be.
so what do we do now?
for now, you need to stay here.
a prisoner, in my own home?
I don't think so.
I can't protect you if you leave the house.
we'll protect ourselves.
we need to let him have Katherine back.
he's not going to stop until he gets her.
if we help him, maybe that ends it.
No! He doesn't deserve to get what he wants.
what other choice do we have?
witches are being pulled down by vampire problems.
as much as we tried to do to stay out of it.
I'll open the tomb.
you get your brother's girl, and destroy the rest with fire.
then this will be all over.
we still have to get Damon to agree.
he already agreed once.
Yeah, and then we double cross him.
so now he's angry.
he's hurt. There's a difference.
I think I know what I have to do.
you've got to be kidding me.
it was Stefan.
there was nothing I could...
just shut up! Stop talking.
without the witch, we don't have Damon or the grimoire.
Damon's not going to stop.
he'll find a way to get in.
and we're going to be there when he does.
I'm going to have to change the locks.
did you stage a jailbreak?
Stefan. - Oh, brother.
ever the white knight.
I convinced Bonnie to help you.
I doubt that.
I'm not going to say that I'm sorry we got the grimoire without you last night, because I'm not, really.
well, at least you're honest.
I was protecting the people I love, Damon.
but so were you, in your own, twisted way.
and as hard as it is to figure, we're all on the same side, after the same thing.
not interested. - Yes, you are.
because you were willing to work With us yesterday.
fool me once, shame on you.
OK, when we were in Atlanta, why didn't you use your compulsion on me?
who's to say I didn't?
you didn't.
I know you didn't.
but you could have.
you and I...we have something.
an understanding.
and I know that my betrayal hurt you, different from how it is with you and Stefan, but I'm promising you this now, I ll help you get Katherine back.
I wish I could believe you.
ask me if I'm lying now.
you know I wouldn't stop, by the way, no matter what I do.
then we'll deal With it.
I didn't compell you in Atlanta because we were having fun.
I wanted it to be real.
I'm trusting you.
don't make me regret it.
the Duke party. I forgot.
I hope they stay clear of the church.
your hope, not mine.
Elena, hey.
Elena, oh, my god. Where have you been?
long story, no time to tell it.
wasn't talking to you. - Sure you were.
we haven't met. I'm Matt.
Matt, there's a reason we haven't met.
you and I are going that way.
Ahhh. I'm sorry, you guys.
we need to clear the debris away.
set the torches like you asked.
we can get down now.
what is that?
it's everything I need to destroy them.
are you sure Damon will come back with her?
brother, witches.
everything ok?
I just want to get this over with.
are we ready?
I guess so.
done!
Hey, uh, I'll be right back.
Hey, man.
uh, you got any weed?
wait, you're kidding me, right?
you act like a total dick every time we cross paths, and now you want to party with me?
I never go with you. I'm just asking question.
dude, I don't get you, man.
it's a party.
you're a partier, ok?
there's no need to psychoanalyze it.
I don't party any more.
and even if I did, it wouldn't be with you.
no problem.
carry on just standing there, by yourself.
all alone.
the enemy of fun.
do you even have any friends?
thank god.
weird hello, but ok.
what's the matter?
uh, nothing. Nothing, just...
it's nothing.
come on, let's walk.
air.
earth.
fire.
water.
that's it, just water from the tap?
as opposed to what?
I just figured maybe it would have to be blessed or mystical or something.
what's that?
it's for Katherine.
gotta have something to get her going.
unless your girl's offering a vein to tap.
admit it...you can't wait to get rid of me.
I can't wait to get rid of you.
hmm.
you ready?
this place is wild.
you kinda like dead people, huh?
I'm strange, remember?
you ok?
Yeah, yeah. Uh...
this place makes me think about someone.
a dead someone?
no, no, just someone I used to know.
so, uh, hey.
we made it all of, what, 37 minutes in that party?
not your scene?
no, I'm not really sure what my scene is any more.
hmm.
so what do you say?
you want to be part of my non-scene?
I would happily be a part of your non-scene, except, uh, I'm leaving.
wait, what?
Yeah. My mom and I are moving away.
Oh, uh...
that's... That's a bummer.
yeah? - Well, yeah.
so...
guess this is good-bye.
I guess it is.
Anna, your face!
it's nothing.
it didn't look like nothing.
you didn't have to hit him that hard.
Yes, I did.
grab him, and let's go.
I'm taking him to meet my mother.
swoop!
Hey!
Ahh.
Where's your date?
who knows?
Ah, is the honeymoon over already?
maybe.
after all that grief you gave me about liking her.
I figured it would have lasted longer than five minutes.
look, I just... I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing.
she... she seems like she might be a little clingy.
well, good.
I need my boy single anyway.
Ooh.
incoming.
Hey.
there you are. - Here I am.
Yeah, well, I'm not drunk enough, so I'm just going to go get another beer.
so...
so.
I have another speech.
OK.
the hand thing with Elena, it was lame.
well, I was lame.
and, hey, your feelings for Elena inside,
Damon was there, and he was always such a jerk to me.
and I wanted to show off that I was with the good guy.
so, anyway, I was lame.
so...
forgiven?
Yeah, of course.
Yeah.
what are they saying?
sounds Latin.
I don't think it's Latin.
what's happening?
it worked!
of course it worked.
weave some fires to build.
I'm gonna go get the gasoline, I'll be right back.
you ready? - What?
you think I'm going to go in there by myself.
so you can seal me in? - Don't take her in.
I'll bring the walls down.
you'll bring walls down if I don't. You think I trust you?
as much as I trust you. - Enough!
both of you.
look, he needs leverage.
he needs to know that you're not going to shut the door when he gets inside.
I get it.
I'll go.
may I?
dark down there?
I thought I told you to leave.
I considered it.
then I thought, screw you.
Hey, hero.
I'm going down there to get my mother.
can't let you do that.
well, Ben's about to make a main course out of Elena's little brother, so you can stop me or him.
your choice.
what is that?
they can sense you.
where is she?!
Damon!
Hey, you're not going in there.
you think you can stop me?
Bonnie...
why did you let her go in?
because she isn't coming out, baby.
none of them are.
do you really think that she cares about you?
hmm?
you're disposable.
I don't care. She already gave me what I want.
you're going to say "Eternal life"?
you're really that stupid?
you know, I've heard about you.
you don't feed.
you're not strong enough to beat me.
is that all you got?
no.
I got this.
Damon?
Damon!
Aahh!
Where's Elena?
Damon took her inside.
What?! Stefan!
if you go in there, you won't come out.
what did you do?
opening the door didn't remove the seal, it just opened the door.
what's the seal?
some seals keep vampires from entering.
this one keeps them from coming out.
Elena's human.
she can leave.
Anna and Katherine can't.
Damon can't.
you weren't even planning on breaking the spell, were you?
I told you.
I'll protect my own.
Elena can get out. That's all that matters.
you must have a taste for it.
you scream and shriek and even bother to escape, but then you just come right back to it.
Oh, oh!
mother!
your boyfriend did this, you know.
his father did.
and Jonathan Gilbert.
made a choice a long time ago that it would be Gilbert's blood that brought her back to life.
I had Jeremy all ready to go, but...
Stefan!
you can't just leave him in there, Grams!
he made his choice!
no.
here.
just tell me what to do. I'll do it!
we are not strong enough.
even if we were able to bring the seal down, there's no guarantee that we can get it back up again.
you said it yourself many things can fuel a witch's power.
help me! Or I'll do it alone.
please don't!
let her go!
No!
go, go. I'll be right behind you.
Anna!
where am I?
Elena, Stefan...He's right behind me.
Stefan, what are you doing?
it's gonna be ok. We'll fix it.
what is it?
I can't.
can't? Can't what?
the spell's still up, we can't get them out. Yet.
you went in there not knowing if you could come back out?
Oh, my god.
I heard you scream.
we can't leave him in there.
we promised him, both of us.
I know.
even if we're able to break through the seal, we won't be able to hold it for long.
she's not here! - Damon.
she's not here.
what?
she's not here!
I think it's working!
I just wanted my mother back.
Jeremy's fine. He's outside. We won't touch him.
Bonnie! Keep going!
you better hurry.
Stefan, they can't hold it much longer!
Damon, we need to get out of here.
it doesn't make sense. They locked her inside.
if we don't leave now, we're not getting out.
how could she not be in here?
it's not worth spending all of eternity down here!
she's not worth it! - No!
Damon!
please.
Oh, my god!
I can't!
Yes, you can!
is this for real?
is what for real?
you being all cool and honest and open?
speech number three, I want this to work.
and I'm scared that you're going to change your mind and you're not going to want it.
I don't want to mess it up.
I don't want to mess it up, either.
he's ok.
he's all right.
I'm sorry.
Hey, let me help you.
Oh, I'm fine.
you don't need to coddle me, baby.
it was a big spell, Grams.
I could tell it took a lot out of you.
I'll be fine.
how's your head?
it's, uh, it's all right.
I just... I wish I knew how I pass out.
I didn't drink that much, I swear.
and you don't remember anything?
the whole thing's pretty cloudy. I just...I know how this looks.
I'm... I'm sorry.
no, Jeremy, don't be sorry.
you didn't do anything, ok?
OK.
I've gotta head over to Bonnie's for a little bit, but is there anything that you need?
Oh, no, I'm just... I'm gonna crash.
OK. Well, Jenna's here, and I'll be back soon.
you knew Katherine wasn't in there.
you wouldn't have helped me.
No!
why do you get happiness?
Damon, please, you wouldn't have helped me! You know you wouldn't!
why do you get it and I don't?!
the guard, the way of the judge, they really want this thing!
she promised to turn him, He was obsessed with her.
she had him under her spell, like everybody else!
he let her go.
the last I saw her was Chicago.
1983.0
she knew where you were, Damon.
she didn't care.
sorry.
I just got to Bonnie's.
everything all right? - Yeah.
how's Damon? Is he going to be ok?
I don't know.
can I call you later?
Yeah, of course.
here you go, Grams.
grams?
grams, wake up!
grams!
Grams?!
Elena!
help!
wake up!
she's not breathing! She's not breathing!
please, wake up!
Yes, I need an ambulance.
it's an emergency.
no, no! I can fix this!
grams, I can fix this! - Bonnie!
Bonnie!
Bonnie.
help! Help!
science EXPERIMENTS - Thanks, Uncle Jacob! - That's okay.
you've had this since we were kids. - Remember that?
you practically slept with it.
you, birthday boy. Come here.
I got something for you.
what could that be?
Thanks. - Do you want to go play?
Yeah. - Okay. Come on.
what?
so, Jake, speaking of chemistry.
you and the lovely Rachel?
strictly professional.
well, of course she is.
look, all I'm saying is that if she is dragging you around by those shiny big handcuffs, well, at least then, I would understand why you took the job.
you know, some people might think that special science advisor to the FBI is a kind of cool job.
you're my big brother.
you're cool no matter who you work for, even if it is the man.
what are you doing, Uncle Jacob?
I was wondering. What do you think happens if I put this into that?
shall we see? - No.
Oh, go on.
awesome! How'd that happen?
well, I'm not really sure, but I think you might find the answer on page 29.
sorry, guys, but we've got to go.
no. Why?
a Tulsa State College student just died of the bends.
the bends? - Second this month.
in Oklahoma?
thought only scuba divers got the bends. - That's right.
and Oklahoma's 500 miles from the nearest ocean, so I guess they weren't scuba diving.
it gets better.
one of the victims couldn't even swim.
Tulsa...
here's our latest victim: Tara Binghamam.
she died a few hours after getting off this plane.
you see this, Rachel?
it's nitrogen in her heart and lungs and liver.
it's caused by rapid decompression. It's, uh...
it's basically... It's bubbles.
it's like this, uh, ginger ale.
you think this is a fizzy drink, right?
right now, there's no bubbles in it. Why?
cause the top is keeping the ginger ale under pressure.
the gas is dissolved in the liquid.
all you need is a sudden drop in pressure.
and you get the bends.
nice work.
sorry I made a bit of a mess there.
excuse me? Were you the attendant on this flight?
Yes.
can you tell me did anyone complain about pressure on their, um, ears or head?
no.
there's something she's not telling us.
O2, go!
see, if there had been rapid decompression, that would have happened but it didn't.
so I don't think the plane's our suspect.
okay, back to square one.
so we'll have to start with Tara Bingham.
she has a sister who also goes to Tulsa State College.
maybe we can get some details from her.
told you. Is there something you want to tell us?
right before her seizure, she was in the galley with a guy.
they were... - Making a sandwich? What?
joining the Mile High Club.
who was the guy?
in the gospel group. 21C.
thank you. - Thank you.
mile High Club. Do they really use that expression?
don't knock it till you tried it, Rachel.
but it's tually six miles, not one.
way to go, Hood. I'm impressed.
Tulsa.
special Agent Young, Dr. Hood, I'm Blake Miller, Tulsa State College's Head of Security.
and a former FBI agent.
I've read your file.
why the change of career?
uh, less stress, more stability.
besides, I- I used to play football here.
I found out that the first victim, Tom Cassidy, stayed on campus during the break and moved into a new apartment.
that's about it.
he didn't go anywhere or do anything that would cause a pressure change.
we'd like to talk to Tara Bingham's sister, Vivian, and to Wade Earlham.
Yeah, they're probably over at Tara's memorial.
I appreciate you take the time right here this is Vivian Bell.
hello.
this is Dr. Hood.
I'm Special Agent Rachel Young.
very sorry about what happened to your sister.
looks like a lot of people loved her.
loving Tara wasn't difficult.
she was always fun, you know?
a happy person.
we just want to know what happened to Tara.
we're trying to piece together the days before she died.
we know she was at the choir competition in Reno with her boyfriend, Wade Earlham.
actually, we were hoping he might be here.
no. Um, Wade hasn't left his dorm room since Tara...
thank you.
we spent the whole time in Reno just studying.
she had her psych paper, and I prepped for my calculus final.
but we even pulled two all-nighters.
dragged our tired butts to the rehearsals and e concert.
I'm Phi Beta Kappa.
and she was...
um, she was on track to be in next year for sure.
well, you definitely get a 4. 0 in lying.
I... I - I don't know what you're talking about.
Zolpidem. Prescription' s in your name. You filled it last week.
there should be 30 pills. I count ten.
and people abusing sleeping pills are usually trying to come down 'cause they're wired on some other drug.
look, Tara and I were in love. I mean...
but doing drugs, having sex on airplanes.
that doesn't really go with the whole Phi Beta Kappa, choir thing.
you know about that?
now, Wade, we need to find out what happened to Tara before it happens to someone else.
if you cared about her like you said you did, then you'd help us.
I...
Oh, s... Sorry.
bought 'em in Reno.
the guy said that they're brand-new, just synthesized.
and he told me that they made sex incredible.
Yeah, but probably not worth dying for.
I don't recognize this symbol.
he called it Pearl.
do you think that those pills killed Tara?
well, if they did-- and that's still an "if" -- then, you'll be in danger, too.
need to get younder medical supervision.
can we get him to the college clinic, please? - sure Wade go with me.
we need to get to the morgue immediately.
Why?
well, I don't think bubbles hang around long in corpses.
bubbles in bodies are always nitrogen.
what you're proposing is medically impossible.
not impossible. Unprecedented.
now, Wade said that Pearl made sex incredible.
and you think it made an excess of nitric oxide in the blood?
and nitric oxide is...
uh, it's the bodys natural chemical signal, and, uh, opens up the arteries and floods the tissues with blood.
I'll be damned.
the bubbles in Tara Bingham are nitric oxide.
look like whoever made this drug overdid it.
producing so much nitric oxide, it overwhelmed Tara's blood.
making bubbles, which became the bends.
just like the ginger ale, but without the pressure change.
exactly.
well, we have a new recreational drug, and it's a killer.
let's find out what it's made of.
you play like a six-year-old.
if I dedicated one tenth as much time to this game as you do, I'd kick your sorry ass.
you know what? I'm going out for a run.
Yeah, if I dedicated one tenth the amount of time that you spend working out, then I'd whoop your sorry ass.
then tag along. Man, for real.
then was the last time you broke a sweat, man, since you grew hair on your little chest?
Hey, well, look, I prefer brain sweat.
all right, that's it.
you're coming with me, or this Xbox goes to charity.
Hey, it's just two miles, if you can handle it.
can you handle it? - Yeah, I can handle it.
can you handle it? - I can handle it!
all right you know, screw that. Let's do... ten miles.
Nah, man, we got team film to watch tonight.
Texas runs this spread offense.
it's super-hard to read, so I got to study up on it.
not worried about that.
but I do smell... Smell that?
smells like cotton candy or something.
it's the... The Cotton Bowl, baby! - The Cotton Bowl, baby!
first time in Tulsa history.
Yes, baby! Are you ready? - I'm-I'm all ready.
right on, man. You're doing great.
I got to get back, though.
no, no. One more lap.
whoever loses does laundry for a month.
isaac. Come on, man. You all right?
isaac. Hey, what's wrong?
help!
isaac. Stay with me. Come on, come on.
help! Help!
let's get him strapped down.
come on. Let's get him stable.
easy, easy.
now, push two more migs Lorazepam.
pushing but he's unrespons with 4 and 4 already.
it's not Tonic-clonic. It's aeg. Let me let me take the bends.
get him into a pressure chamber!
what are you doing here?
FBI. We were notified you have a patient with bends-like seizures.
get him into a pressure amber.
hopefully, we'll shrink the bubbles and we can stop his seizures.
this is a land-locked state. We don't have a pressure chamber.
this is Specl Agent Rachel Young.
I need to find a decompression chamber ASAP.
no, Florida is too far. Look into Texas: Galveston, Port Arthur.
get it here now.
u. S...
Rachal it's working. The chamber pressure is set to 100 meters under water, Dr. Hood.
pressure stopped the seizures.
well, I wish it were that simple.
we've ruled out pressure change as a cause. This is just a temporary solution.
if Isaac's body keeps on making bubbles, we're gonna have to keep on lowering the pressure.
there's only so low we can go before the pressure kills him.
so, how do we stop Pearl from churning out nitric oxide?
we don't. Pearl isn't our problem.
just got the chem analysis back.
crystalline solid disaccharide?
it's table sugar.
pearl is a total fake.
common narcotics scam. - Really?
dealer seeks out a naive mark like Wade, takes his money, leaves him with a dud.
well, the clinic's releasing him.
at least he's out of danger. - Yeah.
that leaves us at zero.
the victims have to have something more in common.
studying. Xbox, sleeping and more Xbox.
Isaac's sort of been in that routine since our folks died.
what happened?
drunk driver.
he walked away without a scratch.
Dr. Hood...
isaac is all I've got, so I need you to be straight with me.
what's gonna happen to him?
well, Isaac's suffering from something we've never seen before, so I honestly can't tell you, but we are doing everything we can to find out what it is.
other than the run you took, had he changed his routine in any way?
no.
let's go.
go ahead, Lawrence. Right there.
he can hear you. Just talk.
Hey, bro.
shouldn't you be at practice?
come on, with you in there like that?
what kind of brother you think I am?
it's not your fault, bro.
or maybe it is.
maybe you owe me front row seats at the Cotton Bowl.
Lawrence, go play.
mom and Dad would have wanted you to.
Yeah.
take care of him.
we'll do everything we can.
so, Lawrence Richmond is a big football star.
so it would seem.
you play any sports in college?
throwing the occasional Frisbee count as a sport?
it's kind of a sport, I guess.
Yeah, well, my dad didn't think so.
he was a high school football coach, so, naturally, he wanted a jock and wound up with me.
well, we have that in common.
really, how so?
my dad wanted a son to follow in his legendary FBI agent footsteps, and instead, he got me.
so, anything you need, we'll have it brought in.
Oh, and the, uh, Coast Guard guys hooked us up with this.
Thanks, Agent Miller. - Blake.
right, Blake.
hood? What are you thinking?
I was thinking, uh, there's another connection here.
Tara collapsed after... sex.
isaac Richmond after jogging.
and Tom Cassidy collapsed moving heavy furniture into an apartment.
that's it-- physical exertion?
but that doesn't cause nitric oxide bubbles, does it?
no, but maybe the physical exertion triggered what did cause the bubbles.
I thought exercise was supposed to be good for you.
Yeah, but exercise can sometimes worsen a viral infection.
do you mind if I, uh... - Yeah. Right here.
thank you.
uh, yeah, it's, uh, Jacob Hood.
I want to ask you a question.
have you had a cold recently?
no.
I've been fine. I got a flu shot and everything.
all three victims got flu shots.
so, you think this flu shot vaccine was mutated to make nitric oxide?
crazy amounts of nitric oxide.
here's what we have left over. - Thank you.
um, I got to ask you. What you're talking about... that's a theory, right?
you sound like the administration.
worried about liability, too?
of course not. It's just, we gave out over 4, 000 of these flu shots.
we'll need all those records.
coach says take it easy, all right?
rest up for the big game.
how's the knee?
it's still bugging me.
yeah... so let me help.
little shot of cortisone might help that.
Nah, man, I'm good.
Yeah, why leave it to chance?
hear there's a couple pro scouts coming to this game.
all right. You're right, man.
you know you're single-handedly lifting TSC out of the second tier, right?
cotton Bowl and national TV exposure
here you go.
just make sure you don't forget about us when you go pro. All right?
what are you doing, man?
you crazy coming anywhere near here?
well, look, Ellis...
we got to delay phase two.
what are you talking about? I thought you said we were good to go.
new and improved, you said.
you, uh... you didn't start, did you?
you let me worry about that.
Hey, why do you want to delay?
the FBI's on campus, Ellis. They're asking questions. Smart questions.
we dropped Isaac down to 300 feet because the seizures came back...
just like you predicted.
it's not a time I want to be right.
they're all normal.
whatever's causing the bubbles, it's definitely not the flu vaccine.
but something's making enough nitric oxide to kill them.
Rachel, Dr. Hood.
Dr. Cogan asked me to give you this virology report on 3 victims' blood
Thanks.
it is a virus.
it's just not the flu.
there's not even a trace of actual flu vaccine in tara's blood work
meaning someone switched the flu vaccine with...sth else?
pretty big mistake.
unless it wasn't a mistake.
you're saying this was intentional?
I'm saying it was murder.
thanks for letting us access your genetics lab, Dr. Ruscillo.
what exactly are we looking at here? Bioterrorism?
well, we don't know yet, but, um, two students are dead;
one's fighting for his life as we speak, so we have to decode this DNA.
and we need backgrounds on everyone who administered flu shots.
you're reading my mind.
okay. Better bring me up to speed here, Dr. Hood.
healthy students get injected with that.
it's dormant for a couple of weeks; then the student exercises.
all of a sudden, there's enough nitric oxide in their blood to kill them.
are you familiar with gene therapy?
Yeah, take DNA, piggyback it onto a virus.
catch a cold, cure a genetic problem.
didn't they do it with, uh, hemophiliacs, give them the gene that clots blood?
exactly.
this is the virus for gene therapies targeted at muscles.
Yeah, that's all the student volunteers who administered flu shots.
clean files on all of them.
four of them took genetics courses, but that's no big thing since they worked in student health.
we'll question them all in the morning, starting with those four.
Yeah.
tough detail?
fascinating detail.
I mean, Hood is...
very smart.
Yes.
very smart.
but, you know, you're not so bad yourself.
Oh, thanks.
creative.
intuitive.
pretty.
I knew you were going to say that.
you did?
intuitive.
Yeah.
Yeah. Nice.
no, I was, I was talking about the...the detail, you know?
the grind. The road.
the endless hotel beds and, you know, rental cars.
it's all a blur.
no, it's...
it's hard when I get back to my real life.
you know?
Yeah. I hear you.
I mean, uh, no, that's, that's what ended my marriage.
part of the reason why I wound up here.
how are we supposed to have relationships in this job?
well, I guess you, you take what you can get and be thankful.
that makes us sound desperate.
not me. I'm a civilian now.
I, I have a, a car - Oh, right.
and an apartment.
your own bed.
Yeah. It's nice.
must be nice.
text message from Hood.
I can't bear this.
much lower, the pressure's going to kill him.
if only there was some way to take the DNA out.
adding genes is the new biomedical revolution.
removing them we just don't know how to do yet.
Yeah, I know.
did you identify your carbonating DNA?
we did.
it's two genes.
one gene makes nitric oxide...
the other one acts like a control knob, turning on the nitric oxide in response to lactic acid.
that's what you get when you exercise, right?
exactly.
I think this is a gene dope giving athlete and improve them
but with this gene-doping, there was a design flaw, which made it deadly.
caused when the virus migrated.
if you get a flu in your nose, it's a cold.
get in your lungs, its pneumonia.
this gene took a detour and ended up in the arteries.
should have been in the muscles.
making superior athletes.
like a steroid.
better than that.
see, the thing with gene-doping as opposed to steroids, it should be undetectable.
those athletes out there-- they want to transform themselves into Greek gods.
having something like this in your muscles, like having an extra pair of legs.
wait.
am I crazy? Or was one of our four flu shot volunteers a sports medicine major?
do you remember this guy?
the guy who had access to the flu shots at the medical center.
but it doesn't make sense.
none of the victims were athletes.
why dope them?
how you holding up, Viv?
okay, I guess.
I just miss my sister is all.
I know.
listen, Viv.
there's something I got to tell you.
life at 800 feet underwater not so bad.
I think I'm going to enlist on a Navy submarine when I get out of here.
you will get out.
isaac, you do know that, right?
Absolutely.
I'm just glad I'm me in here and not my brother.
neither of you should be in there.
I know, but my brother's talented-- special.
I checked you out.
you're an American Engineering Club scholar.
most people here don't even know what that is.
well, they should.
it's pretty impressive.
what, maybe 20 students in the country get that scholarship?
twelve.
exactly.
they go on to make buildings tall and bridges safe.
and may not be as glamorous as other jobs, but doesn't mean it's less important.
Thanks.
how you holding up?
not so good.
I'll-I'll be better tomorrow though.
I'll have someone roll up a TV to this porthole so we can watch my brother kick ass on that field.
hang in there, okay?
FBI. Open up!
check this out.
lawrence Richmond-- Isaac's brother.
Vivian Bingham-- Tara's sister.
andrew Cassidy--brother of the first victim
son of a bitch.
I'm going to call Hood.
yeah? - Hood.
all of the victims have siblings who are athletes.
similar genetics, similar results.
they're guinea pigs.
Dylan's testing his gene-dope?
right, on someone more disposable to them than an athlete.
a regular student, no one notices if something goes wrong.
but a star athlete, under constant scrutiny, that's a different matter.
siblings have the osest blood relations. Makes sense.
I'll call you back.
get this.
our victims were test subjects for Dylan's deadly gene-dope.
unwitting test subjects.
isaac inks he got a flu shot.
but did the athletes know?
well, at least one of them did.
take a look at that.
olympic Diver's Dreams Die in Steroid Scandal.
Tara's sister, Vivian. Already busted for doping.
along comes the promise of an undetectable gene-dope?
irresistible.
she greenlights the test on Tara.
and ends up sacrificing her in the process.
you!
you told me it was harmless!
Dylan said it was!
we had to make sure it didn't show up on any tests before we gave it to you!
but it killed her, Ellis.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
those FBI people need to know this.
I've got to tell them.
no, you are not telling anybody, okay.
you made a choice, Vivian!
you did!
you jumped at our offer.
confirmed that it's undetectable, so that you could keep doping without risking your scholarship, your Olympic bid.
you told it would be safe!
I thought it would be!
okay!
honestly, Viv, if I could give you your gene-dope and your scholarship and your sister and an Olympic gold medal all without any risk, I would.
but I'm not a miracle worker.
and if you go squealing-- your scholarship is the least of our problems.
if I had thought that there would be any risk...
it's not like I wanted her to die either. Okay?
we'll get through this.
together.
900 Feet under the water, Agent Young.
it's close 2 maximum it was a gene-dope that killed my sister Tara.
Ellis Brockton and Dylan Petraneck are the ringleader , Viv, come on, I did this for you, unsend and delete.
your message has been deleted
I had a feeling she knew what happened to her sister.
and this confirms it.
Yeah, I think you're right.
this isn't grief.
this is guilt.
this is screwed up, Ellis.
Viv's dead.
uh, the feds searched my apartment.
now they're looking for me. - Relax. Okay?
listen to me.
we'll say that Viv planted the stuff in your apartment.
I'll hack her e-mail again, send out a new and improved suicide note.
she can take credit for all this.
we play this right, it'll all look like athletes testing their siblings with gene-dope they want for themselves.
nobody'll know where they got it.
we can regroup, improve the product, and try it somewhere else.
all right?
you, you really think this will work?
you think Viv's way is a better option?
no.
teams win all the time on Hail Marys, Dylan.
this is our Hail Mary.
is he going to die?
I don't know, Lawrence.
I'm working with the school's top geneticist to undo what's been done to him.
how much do you want to win this season, Lawrence?
enough to take a performance - enhancing drug regimen?
what are you talking about?
an undetectable gene-dope.
maybe you agreed to test it on your brother.
maybe you thought it wouldn't hurt him.
football's all you got, isn't it?
you win, everything changes for the better.
stop winning, you're just another college jock who doesn't quite have what it takes to go pro.
you're wrong.
isaac is all I got.
Yeah, all right.
we just picked up Petraneck at a bus station.
he was trying to sneak out of town.
no, I don't...I don't know what thats.
even though we found it at your apartment?
someone must have planted it in my apartment.
I'll tell you what.
why don't we try it out on you and we'll find out exactly what it does, huh?
no.
No!
all right, all right.
you sure?
all right.
some of the jocks-- they wanted me to test the gene-dope on their brothers and sists so they wouldn't get caught if it didn't work.
including Lawrence Richmond?
then why'd you test it on his brother Isaac?
lawrence was our meal ticket.
the closest thing to a superstar.
TSC's got it
if I could bring it to him fully tested, if my dope made him into one of the very best, there'd be no limit.
next stop: other colleges...
pros even.
and no limit to how much money you would have made either.
it wasn't just about the money.
it's about science.
I'm a scientist.
but your gene-dope didn't work, did it, Dylan?
three people are dead because of it, and Isaac Richmond is dying as we speak.
we never, uh, wanted anyone to get hurt.
we?
who's "we," Dylan?
or would you rather just sit in a cell alone?
it's up to you.
sit in a cell.
sit in a cell.
that's it.
Dr. Ruscillo, couldn't we make a new gene that would sit in the artery cells and trick the control-knob gene into thinking the lactic acid was low?
and stops the gene-dope from producing nitric oxide.
I don't see why not.
it's just adding a gene.
all right, Dylan.
I'm gonna ask you one last time.
who's "we"?
he's the only one who ever believed in me, believed in my work.
give me a name.
Ellis Brockton, stop! FBI!!!
Ellis Brockton, you are under arrest.
are you sure about this?
don't have time to be sure.
put in the oxygen it would take him 5 mins to equalize the chambers
I've got him at a thousand feet, Dr. Hood, 'cause right now that's the only way we can keep him alive.
but a healthy person should not be doing this.
I'm well aware of the risks, Officer.
thank you.
when I've got you down to depth, you can twist that lever and go to the next chamber
just get me down there quickly, please.
you can't play.
what are you talking about?
listen to me.
listen to me!
you've been injected with the same thing Isaac has.
Ellis Brockton confessed that he gave you a shot of cortisone.
yeah...
but it wasn't cortisone.
what? - They tested it on your brother first to see what would happen to you.
now if u have a seizure out there we might not have time to get you to a pressure chamber.
you could die.
or I could make it.
man, y'all, y'all don't understand.
I feel strong, man.
man, this game is my future, man!
no, you don't understand.
all right, you go out on that field, you may not have a future.
you with Lawrence? - ah, yeah.
we got him.
who is this?
it's me, bro.
I'm better.
I'm better.
I'm coming to see you, bro.
Yeah, man, I'm...I'm coming.
they're doing well.
Oh, they're doing awesome, especially Lawrence.
thanks to you, he should be able to keep playing football.
Well...if you ever have any other weird scientific crimes happen around here you know who to call.
hmm, yeah, well, I'll see if I can arrange somethin"weird" with the physics department then.
yeah...
Yeah.
all right.
it's been a real pleasure.
help! Help!
science EXPERIMENTS - Thanks, Uncle Jacob! - That's okay.
you've had this since we were kids. - Remember that?
you practically slept with it.
yo, birthday boy. Come here.
I got something for you.
what could that be?
Thanks. - Do you want to go play?
Yeah. - Okay. Come on.
what?
so, Jake, speaking of chemistry.
you and the lovely Rachel?
strictly professional.
well, of course she is.
look, all I'm saying is that if she is dragging you around by those shiny big handcuffs, well, at least then, I would understand why you took the job.
you know, some people might think that special science advisor to the FBI is a kind of cool job.
you're my big brother.
you're cool no matter who you work for, even if it is the man.
what you doing, Uncle Jacob?
I was wondering. What do you think happens if I put this into that?
shall we see? - No.
Oh, go on.
awesome! How'd that happen?
well, I'm not really sure, but I think you might find the answer on page 29.
sorry, guys, but we've got to go.
no. Why?
a Tulsa State College student just died of the bends.
the bends? - Second this month.
in Oklahoma?
thought only scuba divers got the bends. - That's right.
and Oklahoma's 500 miles from the nearest ocean, so I guess they weren't scuba diving.
it gets better.
one of the victims couldn't even swim.
Tulsa...
here's our latest victim: Tara Binghamam.
she died a few hours after getting off this plane.
you see this, Rachel?
it's nitrogen in her heart and lungs and liver.
it's caused by rapid decompression. It's, uh...
it's basically... It's bubbles.
it's like this, uh, ginger ale.
you think this is a fizzy drink, right?
right now, there's no bubbles in it. Why?
cause the top is keeping the ginger ale under pressure.
the gas is dissolved in the liquid.
all you need is a sudden drop in pressure.
and you get the bends.
nice work.
sorry I made a bit of a mess there.
excuse me? Were you the attendant on this flight?
Yes.
can you tell me did anyone complain about pressure on their, um, ears or head?
no.
there's something she's not telling us.
O2, go!
see, if there had been rapid decompression, that would have happened...
but it didn't.
so I don't think the plane's our suspect.
okay, back to square one.
so we'll have to start with Tara Bingham.
she has a sister who also goes to Tulsa State College.
maybe we can get some details from her.
told you. Is there something you want to tell us?
right before her seizure, she was in the galley with a guy.
they were... - Making a sandwich? What?
joining the Mile High Club.
who was the guy?
in the gospel group. 21C.
thank you. - Thank you.
mile High Club. Do they really use that expression?
don't knock it till you tried it, Rachel.
but it's tually six miles, not one.
way to go, Hood. I'm impressed.
Tulsa.
special Agent Young, Dr. Hood, I'm Blake Miller, Tulsa State College's Head of Security.
and a former FBI agent.
I've read your file.
why the change of career?
uh, less stress, more stability.
besides, I used to play football here.
I found out that the first victim, Tom Cassidy, stayed on campus during the break and moved into a new apartment.
that's about it.
he didn't go anywhere or do anything that would cause a pressure change.
we'd like to talk to Tara Bingham's sister, Vivian, and to Wade Earlham.
Yeah, they're probably over at Tara's memorial.
appreciate you take the time right here this is vivian bell
hello.
this is Dr. Hood.
I'm Special Agent Rachel Young.
very sorry about what happened to your sister.
looks like a lot of people loved her.
loving Tara wasn't difficult.
she was always fun, you know?
a happy person.
we just want to know what happened to Tara.
we're trying to piece together the days before she died.
we know she was at the choir competition in Reno with her boyfriend, Wade Earlham.
actually, we were hoping he might be here.
no. Um, Wade hasn't left his dorm room since Tara...
thank you.
we spent the whole time in Reno just studying.
she had her psych paper, and I prepped for my calculus final.
but we even pulled two all-nighters.
dragged our tired butts to the rehearsals and e concert.
I'm Phi Beta Kappa.
and she was...
um, she was on track to be in next year for sure.
well, you definitely get a 4. 0 in lying.
I... I don't know what you're talking about.
Zolpidem. Prescription's in your name. You filled it last week.
there should be 30 pills. I count ten.
and people abusing sleeping pills are usually trying to come down 'cause they're wired on some other drug.
look, Tara and I were in love. I mean...
but doing drugs, having sex on airplanes.
that doesn't really go with the whole Phi Beta Kappa, choir thing.
you know about that?
now, Wade, we need to find out what happened to Tara before it happens to someone else.
if you cared about her like you said you did, then you'd help us.
I...
Oh, s... Sorry.
bought 'em in Reno.
the guy said that they're brand-new, just synthesized.
and he told me that they made sex incredible.
Yeah, but probably not worth dying for.
I don't recognize this symbol.
he called it Pearl.
do you think that those pills killed Tara?
well, if they did-- and that's still an "if" -- then, you'll be in danger, too.
need to get younder medical supervision.
can we get him to the college clinic, please? - sure Wade go with me.
we need to get to the morgue immediately.
Why?
well, I don't think bubbles hang around long in corpses.
bubbles in bodies are always nitrogen.
what you're proposing is medically impossible.
not impossible. Unprecedented.
now, Wade said that Pearl made sex incredible.
and you think it made an excess of nitric oxide in the blood?
and nitric oxide is...
uh, it's the bodys natural chemical signal, and, uh, opens up the arteries and floods the tissues with blood.
I'll be damned.
the bubbles in Tara Bingham are nitric oxide.
look like whoever made this drug overdid it.
producing so much nitric oxide, it overwhelmed Tara's blood.
making bubbles, which became the bends.
just like the ginger ale, but without the pressure change.
exactly.
well, we have a new recreational drug, and it's a killer.
let's find out what it's made of.
you play like a six-year-old.
if I dedicated one tenth as much time to this game as you do, I'd kick your sorry ass.
you know what? I'm going out for a run.
Yeah, if I dedicated one tenth the amount of time that you spend working out, then I'd whoop your sorry ass.
then tag along. Man, for real.
then was the last time you broke a sweat, man, since you grew hair on your little chest?
Hey, well, look, I prefer brain sweat.
all right, that's it.
you're coming with me, or this Xbox goes to charity.
Hey, it's just two miles, if you can handle it.
can you handle it? - Yeah, I can handle it.
can you handle it? - I can handle it!
all right you know, screw that. Let's do... ten miles.
Nah, man, we got team film to watch tonight.
Texas runs this spread offense.
it's super-hard to read, so I got to study up on it.
not worried about that.
but I do smell... Smell that?
smells like cotton candy or something.
it's the... The Cotton Bowl, baby! - The Cotton Bowl, baby!
first time in Tulsa history.
Yes, baby! Are you ready? - I'm-I'm all ready.
right on, man. You're doing great.
I got to get back, though.
no, no. One more lap.
whoever loses does laundry for a month.
isaac. Come on, man. You all right?
isaac. Hey, what's wrong?
help!
isaac. Stay with me. Come on, come on.
help! Help!
let's get him strapped down.
come on. Let's get him stable.
easy, easy.
now, push two more migs Lorazepam.
pushing but he's unrespons with 4 and 4 already.
it's not Tonic-clonic. It's aeg. Let me let me take the bends.
get him into a pressure chamber!
what are you doing here?
FBI. We were notified you have a patient with bends-like seizures.
get him into a pressure amber.
hopefully, we'll shrink the bubbles and we can stop his seizures.
this is a land-locked state. We don't have a pressure chamber.
this is Specl Agent Rachel Young.
I need to find a decompression chamber ASAP.
no, Florida is too far. Look into Texas: Galveston, Port Arthur.
get it here now.
u. S...
Rachal it's working. The chamber pressure is set to 100 meters under water, Dr. Hood.
pressure stopped the seizures.
well, I wish it were that simple.
we've ruled out pressure change as a cause. This is just a temporary solution.
if Isaac's body keeps on making bubbles, we're gonna have to keep on lowering the pressure.
there's only so low we can go before the pressure kills him.
so, how do we stop Pearl from churning out nitric oxide?
we don't. Pearl isn't our problem.
just got the chem analysis back.
crystalline solid disaccharide?
it's table sugar.
pearl is a total fake.
common narcotics scam. - Really?
dealer seeks out a naive mark like Wade, takes his money, leaves him with a dud.
well, the clinic's releasing him.
at least he's out of danger. - Yeah.
that leaves us at zero.
the victims have to have something more in common.
studying. Xbox, sleeping and more Xbox.
Isaac's sort of been in that routine since our folks died.
what happened?
drunk driver.
he walked away without a scratch.
Dr. Hood...
isaac is all I've got, so I need you to be straight with me.
what's gonna happen to him?
well, Isaac's suffering from something we've never seen before, so I honestly can't tell you, but we are doing everything we can to find out what it is.
other than the run you took, had he changed his routine in any way?
no.
let's go.
go ahead, Lawrence. Right there.
he can hear you. Just talk.
Hey, bro.
shouldn't you be at practice?
come on, with you in there like that?
what kind of brother you think I am?
it's not your fault, bro.
or maybe it is.
maybe you owe me front row seats at the Cotton Bowl.
Lawrence, go play.
mom and Dad would have wanted you to.
Yeah.
take care of him.
we'll do everything we can.
so, Lawrence Richmond is a big football star.
so it would seem.
you play any sports in college?
throwing the occasional Frisbee count as a sport?
it's kind of a sport, I guess.
Yeah, well, my dad didn't think so.
he was a high school football coach, so, naturally, he wanted a jock and wound up with me.
well, we have that in common.
really, how so?
my dad wanted a son to follow in his legendary FBI agent footsteps, and instead, he got me.
so, anything you need, we'll have it brought in.
Oh, and the, uh, Coast Guard guys hooked us up with this.
Thanks, Agent Miller. - Blake.
right, Blake.
hood? What are you thinking?
I was thinking, uh, there's another connection here.
Tara collapsed after... sex.
isaac Richmond after jogging.
and Tom Cassidy collapsed moving heavy furniture into an apartment.
that's it-- physical exertion?
but that doesn't cause nitric oxide bubbles, does it?
no, but maybe the physical exertion triggered what did cause the bubbles.
I thought exercise was supposed to be good for you.
Yeah, but exercise can sometimes worsen a viral infection.
do you mind if I, uh... - Yeah. Right here.
thank you.
uh, yeah, it's, uh, Jacob Hood.
I want to ask you a question.
have you had a cold recently?
no.
I've been fine. I got a flu shot and everything.
all three victims got flu shots.
so, you think this flu shot vaccine was mutated to make nitric oxide?
crazy amounts of nitric oxide.
here's what we have left over. - Thank you.
um, I got to ask you. What you're talking about... that's a theory, right?
you sound like the administration.
worried about liability, too?
of course not. It's just, we gave out over 4, 000 of these flu shots.
we'll need all those records.
coach says take it easy, all right?
rest up for the big game.
how's the knee?
it's still bugging me.
yeah... so let me help.
little shot of cortisone might help that.
Nah, man, I'm good.
Yeah, why leave it to chance?
hear there's a couple pro scouts coming to this game.
all right. You're right, man.
you know you're single-handedly lifting TSC out of the second tier, right?
cotton Bowl and national TV exposure
here you go.
just make sure you don't forget about us when you go pro. All right?
what are you doing, man?
you crazy coming anywhere near here?
well, look, Ellis...
we got to delay phase two.
what are you talking about? I thought you said we were good to go.
new and improved, you said.
you, uh... you didn't start, did you?
you let me worry about that.
Hey, why do you want to delay?
the FBI's on campus, Ellis. They're asking questions. Smart questions.
we dropped Isaac down to 300 feet because the seizures came back...
just like you predicted.
it's not a time I want to be right.
they're all normal.
whatever's causing the bubbles, it's definitely not the flu vaccine.
but something's making enough nitric oxide to kill them.
Rachel, Dr. Hood.
Dr. Cogan asked me to give you this virology report on 3 victims' blood
Thanks.
it is a virus.
it's just not the flu.
there's not even a trace of actual flu vaccine in tara's blood work
meaning someone switched the flu vaccine with...sth else?
pretty big mistake.
unless it wasn't a mistake.
you're saying this was intentional?
I'm saying it was murder.
thanks for letting us access your genetics lab, Dr. Ruscillo.
what exactly are we looking at here? Bioterrorism?
well, we don't know yet, but, um, two students are dead;
one's fighting for his life as we speak, so we have to decode this DNA.
and we need backgrounds on everyone who administered flu shots.
you're reading my mind.
okay. Better bring me up to speed here, Dr. Hood.
healthy students get injected with that.
it's dormant for a couple of weeks; then the student exercises.
all of a sudden, there's enough nitric oxide in their blood to kill them.
are you familiar with gene therapy?
Yeah, take DNA, piggyback it onto a virus.
catch a cold, cure a genetic problem.
didn't they do it with, uh, hemophiliacs, give them the gene that clots blood?
exactly.
this is the virus for gene therapies targeted at muscles.
Yeah, that's all the student volunteers who administered flu shots.
clean files on all of them.
four of them took genetics courses, but that's no big thing since they worked in student health.
we'll question them all in the morning, starting with those four.
Yeah.
tough detail?
fascinating detail.
I mean, Hood is...
very smart.
Yes.
very smart.
but, you know, you're not so bad yourself.
Oh, thanks.
creative.
intuitive.
pretty.
I knew you were going to say that.
you did?
intuitive.
Yeah.
Yeah. Nice.
no, I was, I was talking about the...the detail, you know?
the grind. The road.
the endless hotel beds and, you know, rental cars.
it's all a blur.
no, it's...
it's hard when I get back to my real life.
you know?
Yeah. I hear you.
I mean, uh, no, that's, that's what ended my marriage.
part of the reason why I wound up here.
how are we supposed to have relationships in this job?
well, I guess you, you take what you can get and be thankful.
that makes us sound desperate.
not me. I'm a civilian now.
I, I have a, a car - Oh, right.
and an apartment.
your own bed.
Yeah. It's nice.
must be nice.
text message from Hood.
I can't bear this.
much lower, the pressure's going to kill him.
if only there was some way to take the DNA out.
adding genes is the new biomedical revolution.
removing them we just don't know how to do yet.
Yeah, I know.
did you identify your carbonating DNA?
we did.
it's two genes.
one gene makes nitric oxide...
the other one acts like a control knob, turning on the nitric oxide in response to lactic acid.
that's what you get when you exercise, right?
exactly.
I think this is a gene dope giving athlete and improve them
but with this gene-doping, there was a design flaw, which made it deadly.
caused when the virus migrated.
if you get a flu in your nose, it's a cold.
get in your lungs, its pneumonia.
this gene took a detour and ended up in the arteries.
should have been in the muscles.
making superior athletes.
like a steroid.
better than that.
see, the thing with gene-doping as opposed to steroids, it should be undetectable.
those athletes out there-- they want to transform themselves into Greek gods.
having something like this in your muscles, like having an extra pair of legs.
wait.
am I crazy? Or was one of our four flu shot volunteers a sports medicine major?
do you remember this guy?
the guy who had access to the flu shots at the medical center.
but it doesn't make sense.
none of the victims were athletes.
why dope them?
how you holding up, Viv?
okay, I guess.
I just miss my sister is all.
I know.
listen, Viv.
there's something I got to tell you.
life at 800 feet underwater not so bad.
I think I'm going to enlist on a Navy submarine when I get out of here.
you will get out.
isaac, you do know that, right?
Absolutely.
I'm just glad I'm me in here and not my brother.
neither of you should be in there.
I know, but my brother's talented-- special.
I checked you out.
you're an American Engineering Club scholar.
most people here don't even know what that is.
well, they should.
it's pretty impressive.
what, maybe 20 students in the country get that scholarship?
twelve.
exactly.
they go on to make buildings tall and bridges safe.
and may not be as glamorous as other jobs, but doesn't mean it's less important.
Thanks.
how you holding up?
not so good.
I'll-I'll be better tomorrow though.
I'll have someone roll up a TV to this porthole so we can watch my brother kick ass on that field.
hang in there, okay?
FBI. Open up!
check this out.
lawrence Richmond-- Isaac's brother.
Vivian Bingham-- Tara's sister.
andrew Cassidy--brother of the first victim
son of a bitch.
I'm going to call Hood.
yeah? - Hood.
all of the victims have siblings who are athletes.
similar genetics, similar results.
they're guinea pigs.
Dylan's testing his gene-dope?
right, on someone more disposable to them than an athlete.
a regular student, no one notices if something goes wrong.
but a star athlete, under constant scrutiny, that's a different matter.
siblings have the osest blood relations. Makes sense.
I'll call you back.
get this.
our victims were test subjects for Dylan's deadly gene-dope.
unwitting test subjects.
isaac inks he got a flu shot.
but did the athletes know?
well, at least one of them did.
take a look at that.
olympic Diver's Dreams Die in Steroid Scandal.
Tara's sister, Vivian. Already busted for doping.
along comes the promise of an undetectable gene-dope?
irresistible.
she greenlights the test on Tara.
and ends up sacrificing her in the process.
you!
you told me it was harmless!
Dylan said it was!
we had to make sure it didn't show up on any tests before we gave it to you!
but it killed her, Ellis.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
those FBI people need to know this.
I've got to tell them.
no, you are not telling anybody, okay.
you made a choice, Vivian!
you did!
you jumped at our offer.
confirmed that it's undetectable, so that you could keep doping without risking your scholarship, your Olympic bid.
you told it would be safe!
I thought it would be!
okay!
honestly, Viv, if I could give you your gene-dope and your scholarship and your sister and an Olympic gold medal all without any risk, I would.
but I'm not a miracle worker.
and if you go squealing-- your scholarship is the least of our problems.
if I had thought that there would be any risk...
it's not like I wanted her to die either. Okay?
we'll get through this.
together.
900 Feet under the water, Agent Young.
it's close 2 maximum it was a gene-dope that killed my sister Tara.
Ellis Brockton and Dylan Petraneck are the ringleader , Viv, come on, I did this for you, unsend and delete.
your message has been deleted
I had a feeling she knew what happened to her sister.
and this confirms it.
Yeah, I think you're right.
this isn't grief.
this is guilt.
this is screwed up, Ellis.
Viv's dead.
uh, the feds searched my apartment.
now they're looking for me. - Relax. Okay?
listen to me.
we'll say that Viv planted the stuff in your apartment.
I'll hack her e-mail again, send out a new and improved suicide note.
she can take credit for all this.
we play this right, it'll all look like athletes testing their siblings with gene-dope they want for themselves.
nobody'll know where they got it.
we can regroup, improve the product, and try it somewhere else.
all right?
you, you really think this will work?
you think Viv's way is a better option?
no.
teams win all the time on Hail Marys, Dylan.
this is our Hail Mary.
is he going to die?
I don't know, Lawrence.
I'm working with the school's top geneticist to undo what's been done to him.
how much do you want to win this season, Lawrence?
enough to take a performance - enhancing drug regimen?
what are you talking about?
an undetectable gene-dope.
maybe you agreed to test it on your brother.
maybe you thought it wouldn't hurt him.
football's all you got, isn't it?
you win, everything changes for the better.
stop winning, you're just another college jock who doesn't quite have what it takes to go pro.
you're wrong.
isaac is all I got.
Yeah, all right.
we just picked up Petraneck at a bus station.
he was trying to sneak out of town.
no, I don't...I don't know what thats.
even though we found it at your apartment?
someone must have planted it in my apartment.
I'll tell you what.
why don't we try it out on you and we'll find out exactly what it does, huh?
no.
No!
all right, all right.
you sure?
all right.
some of the jocks-- they wanted me to test the gene-dope on their brothers and sists so they wouldn't get caught if it didn't work.
including Lawrence Richmond?
then why'd you test it on his brother Isaac?
lawrence was our meal ticket.
the closest thing to a superstar.
TSC's got it
if I could bring it to him fully tested, if my dope made him into one of the very best, there'd be no limit.
next stop: other colleges...
pros even.
and no limit to how much money you would have made either.
it wasn't just about the money.
it's about science.
I'm a scientist.
but your gene-dope didn't work, did it, Dylan?
three people are dead because of it, and Isaac Richmond is dying as we speak.
we never, uh, wanted anyone to get hurt.
we?
who's "we," Dylan?
or would you rather just sit in a cell alone?
it's up to you.
sit in a cell.
sit in a cell.
that's it.
Dr. Ruscillo, couldn't we make a new gene that would sit in the artery cells and trick the control-knob gene into thinking the lactic acid was low?
and stops the gene-dope from producing nitric oxide.
I don't see why not.
it's just adding a gene.
all right, Dylan.
I'm gonna ask you one last time.
who's "we"?
he's the only one who ever believed in me, believed in my work.
give me a name.
Ellis Brockton, stop! FBI!!!
Ellis Brockton, you are under arrest.
are you sure about this?
don't have time to be sure.
put in the oxygen it would take him 5 mins to equalize the chambers
I've got him at a thousand feet, Dr. Hood, 'cause right now that's the only way we can keep him alive.
but a healthy person should not be doing this.
I'm well aware of the risks, Officer.
thank you.
when I've got you down to depth, you can twist that lever and go to the next chamber
just get me down there quickly, please.
you can't play.
what are you talking about?
listen to me.
listen to me!
you've been injected with the same thing Isaac has.
Ellis Brockton confessed that he gave you a shot of cortisone.
yeah...
but it wasn't cortisone.
what? - They tested it on your brother first to see what would happen to you.
Nowif u have a seizure out there we might not have time to get you to a pressure chamber.
you could die.
or I could make it.
man, y'all, y'all don't understand.
I feel strong, man.
man, this game is my future, man!
no, you don't understand.
all right, you go out on that field, you may not have a future.
you with Lawrence? - ah, yeah.
we got him.
who is this?
it's me, bro.
I'm better.
I'm better.
I'm coming to see you, bro.
Yeah, man, I'm...I'm coming.
they're doing well.
Oh, they're doing awesome, especially Lawrence.
thanks to you, he should be able to keep playing football.
Well...if you ever have any other weird scientific crimes happen around here you know who to call.
hmm, yeah, well, I'll see if I can arrange somethin"weird" with the physics department then.
yeah...
Yeah.
all right.
it's been a real pleasure.
for over a century, I have lived in secret -- until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
our love for Katherine wasn't real, Damon.
it was real for me. I'm going to bring her back.
there's a tomb underneath the church.
a spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.
tell me how to get in the tomb.
the grimoire. - Where is it?
check the journal. Jonathan gilbert's.
the grimoire. It was emily's, right?
that's what you need to reverse the spell. I'll help you.
you just couldn't live without me, huh?
your eye!
Where'd she go? - Where'd who go?
I wouldn't.
don't try to escape.
don't even move.
do you understand?
I understand.
Seriously?!
I told her not to move! I did that eye thing you taught me.
you forgot the lesson about vervain. She takes a vampire venom, duh!
who are you? What do you want?
doesn't matter.
Oh, my god!
Anna took Elena.
Yeah, I got that from your 600 voicemails.
Damon, all night long, every single street in town, I've been searching.
what if your blood hasn't passed out of her system?
well, then at least you know you'll see her again.
please.
what do you know?
you were with Anna. you must know where she's living. Just tell me where I can find her.
Nope.
you can go.
really.
you know, all I can remember is hating you.
there might have been a time when that was different, but your choices have erased anything good about you.
but see, I also know that you have just as much reason to hate me.
this all began with me.
Katherine got taken away from you because of me.
and I'm sorry.
apology accepted.
so please, just tell me what you know.
it's Elena, Damon. If you know something... Tell me.
I mean this sincerely.
I hope Elena dies.
Oh, you're ok!
my head... - Come here.
Oh, my god! ben is a...
they can hear.
I was so stupid!
Oh, he had all of us fooled.
what's going on? Why are we here?
it must have something to do with the tomb and Emily's spell book.
spell book?
Damon said that it could be used to open the tomb.
why didn't I know about any of this?
I was trying to keep you out of it, hoping it would never come to this.
come to what?
they need a witch to break the spell and let the vampires out.
no way. - I know
you're wasting your time.
I'm not going to help you.
that's why she's here.
motivation for you to behave. You know, you shouldn't be so desperate.
you made it too easy.
she needs to talk to you.
you really are Katherine's doppelganger.
you must have the Salvatore boys reeling.
who are you?
I'm Anna.
your brother may have mentioned me.
I mean, we're, like, practically dating.
ten kegs?
you know how much damage we could do with ten kegs?
Duke's got it all hooked up.
Duke's a douche.
Yeah, a douche with ten kegs.
aka, my new best friend.
what's the problem, Gilbert?
don't have one, Lockwood.
Yeah, I didn't think so.
you ever get bored of it?
of what? - yourself?
keep laughing, buddy.
Hey, Jeremy.
where is Elena? I have been texting her and Bonnie all day about Duke's party.
uh, she went somewhere with Stefan.
I am so not going to be one of those girls who disappears just because she has a new boyfriend.
who is Duke?
some guy that graduated a couple years ago.
and he throws a party every time he comes home from Duke.
wait, Duke goes to duke?
his real name is Bob or something.
he's a total ass. But he buys the beer.
maybe you should come.
uh, yeah. I don't think so.
no, seriously. Everyone goes.
even quiet loner little brothers.
think about it.
Hey! - Hey.
so I have speech.
it is fully scripted and well-rehearsed. Are you ready for it?
you wrote a speech? - Yes.
it's a "you kissed me and I don't want things to be weird" speech.
it's pre-emptive.
pre-emptive.
Yeah, you know, in case you were having second thoughts or regrets or... were, ike, ooged out.
Ooged, huh?
can I just get on with the speech part?
Yeah, go for it.
so I know that you don't think that this is going to work out between us.
I just want to let you know what right here and right now, I'm offering you an out.
like an escape clause.
why are you giving me an escape clause?
I don't want to make assumptions about what it is we are doing here.
got it.
so, if you would like to exercise it, just let me know.
I'm good, but thanks.
OK. Good.
Yeah. - so...
see you for Duke's tonight. - Yeah.
yes?
hi there.
I'm looking for Bonnie.
she's not here.
Oh, do you know when she would - Never.
you have quite an opinion for someone who doesn't know me.
you got some nerve knocking on a Bennett witch's door and asking her for anything.
What'd I do?
spirits talk, Mr. Salvatore, and so does my granddaughter.
you are no friend to us.
now get off my porch.
step outside and say that.
I am not Bonnie.
you don't want to mess with me.
Bonnie's not going to open the tomb.
Oh, I think she will.
do you really want Katherine out that bad?
trust me.
no one I know wants to see that girl again.
except Damon, the lovestruck idiot.
then what is it?
or who is it?
my mother's in there.
Katherine couldn't help herself.
she just had toy around with both of the Salvatore brothers.
and when she got caught, so did my mother.
I watched Jonathan Gilbert take her away.
I'm sorry.
you really mean that, don't you?
Yeah, I think we'll skip the dead mom bonding so you can start serving a purpose.
which is what?
leverage.
this belong to you?
Elena, are you ok?
she's fine, for now.
tell me you have the grimoire and she'll stay fine.
I can get it.
which means your brother has it. And I have the witch.
so one of you had better meet me in the very public town square in 30 minutes so we can safely discuss how fun it's going to be to work together.
go ahead. Grovel again. Oh, wait, no.
I don't care.
I'm leaving.
keep them buttoned down.
compsion won't work. Just use violence right. I got that.
sit. Behave.
you're the key to this. Literally.
the one who opens the door.
tell me, how long have you been a witch?
is there anything to drink here?
are you offering?
there's water on the nightstand.
Hey. Can I have a sip?
come back in, shut the door!
don't hurt her!
don't make me!
lock it.
Hey, what, uh, what happened to you last night?
sorry , I had to leave.
I told your sister to tell you.
Oh, I haven't seen her.
well, I gotta run, so
Hey, do you want to go to a party tonight?
do I what?
the guy that's throwing it is a total douche, but it's, uh, it's supposed to be fun.
I figured, you know, safety in numbers.
so you're finally ready to go out with me, are you?
it's been a while since I've been to a party, and I kindda want to get back out there.
and not be such a loner.
and, uh, I like you.
you're fun, and you're also kind of strange and lurky, but, huh, I guess I like that, too.
so, yeah, you should come to the party. With me.
it's in the woods by that old cemetery.
Oh. It's there, huh?
that sounds cool.
uh, I'll meet yo oh --ok! great!
cool. - Ok!
got a hot date, or are you just planning on nabbing the entire Gilbert family?
a party, right next to the old cemetery.
isn't that nice of them?
lots of warm bloods for starving vampires.
I told you. I work alone.
Yeah, so do I.
but you're minus a witch and I'm minus spell book.
so what do you say?
Stefan will come after you, you know that. For messing with Elena.
then he won't be too happy if I kill her when I don't get what I want.
when do you want to do this?
God, it's like 1864 all over again.
you Salvatore's are truly pathetic when it comes to women.
tonight. After sundown.
meet at the church.
witches don't have eternal life, right?
so you guys can die.
Yeah, we can die.
that sucks.
let's get outside.
when the sun goes down, leave town.
if I ever see you again, I will kill you.
how did you know where were we?
many things can feel a witch's power.
worry, anger.
after Stefan told me that they had taken you, I had a lot of both.
simple locator spell was easy after that.
I'm sorry about all of this.
not as sorry as they're gonna be. So what do we do now?
for now, you need to stay here.
a prisoner, in my own home?
I don't think so.
I can't protect you if you leave the house.
we'll protect ourselves.
we need to let him have Katherine back.
he's not going to stop until he gets her. If we help him, maybe that ends it.
No! he doesn't deserve to get what he wants.
what other choice do we have?
witches being pulled down by vampire problems.
as much as we tried to do to stay out of it.
I'll open the tomb.
you get your brother's girl, and destroy the rest with fire.
then this will be all over.
we still have to get damon to agree.
he already agreed once.
Yeah, and then we double cross him.
so now he's angry. - he's hurt. There's a difference.
I think I know what I have to do.
you've got to be kidding me.
it was Stefan.
there was nothing I could - Shut up! Stop talking.
without the witch, we don't have damon or the grimoire.
Damon's not going to stop.
he'll find a way to get in.
and we're going to be there when he does.
I'm going to have to change the locks.
did you stage a jailbreak?
Stefan. Oh, brother.
ever the white knight.
I convinced bonnie to help you.
I doubt that.
I'm not going to say that I'm sorry we got the grimoire without you last night, because I'm not, really.
well, at least you're honest.
I was protecting the people I love, Damon.
but so were you, in your own, twisted way.
and as hard as it is to figure, we're all on the same side, after the same thing.
not interested. - Yes, you are.
because you were willing to work with us yesterday.
fool me once, shame on you.
OK, when we were in Atlanta, why didn't you use your compulsion on me?
who's to say I didn't?
you didn't.
I know you didn't.
but you could have.
you and I...
we have something.
an understanding.
and I know that my betrayal hurt you, different from how it is with you and Stefan, but I'm promising you this now, I'll help you get Katherine back.
I wish I could believe you. Ask me if I'm lying now.
you know I wanna stop, by the way, no matter what I do.
then we'll deal with it.
I didn't compel you in Atlanta because we were having fun.
I wanted it to be real.
I'm trusting you.
don't make me regret it.
the Duke party. I forgot. I hope they stay clear of the church.
your hope, not mine.
Elena, hey.
Elena, oh, my god. where have you been?
long story, no time to tell it.
wasn't talking to you. - Sure you were.
we haven't met. I'm Matt.
Matt, there's a reason we haven't met.
you and I are going that way.
I'm sorry, you guys.
cleared the debris away.
set the torches like you asked. We can get down now.
what is that?
it's everything I need to destroy them.
are you sure Damon will come back with her?
brother, witches.
everything ok?
I just want to get this over with. Are we ready?
I guess so.
come on go go go come on go go go done!
Hey, uh, I'll be right back.
Hey, man.
uh, you got any weed?
wait, you're kidding me, right?
you act like a total dick every time we cross paths, and now you want to party with me?
I'm just asking question.
dude, I don't get you, man.
it's a party. You're a partier, ok?
there's no need to psycho-analyze it.
I don't party anymore. And even if I did, it wouldn't be with you.
no problem.
carry on just standing there, by yourself.
all alone. The enemy of fun.
do you even have any friends?
thank god, weird hello, but ok.
what's the matter?
uh, nothin'. nothing, just...It's nothin'.
come on, let walk.
air.
earth.
fire.
water.
that's it, just water from the tap?
as opposed to what?
I just figured maybe it would have to be blessed or mystical or something.
what's that?
it's for Katherine.
gotta have something to get her going.
unless your girl's offering a vein to tap.
admit it.
you can't wait to get rid of me.
I can't wait to get rid of you.
you ready?
this place is wild.
you kinda like dead people. Huh I'm strange, remember?
you ok?
Yeah, yeah. Uh...
this place makes me think about someone.
a dead someone?
no, no, just...
someone I used to know.
so, uh, hey.
we made it all of, what, 37 minutes in that party?
not your scene?
no, I'm not really sure what my scene is anymore.
so what do you say? you want to be part of my non-scene?
I would happily be a part of your non-scene, except, uh, I'm leaving.
wait, what?
Yeah. My mom and I are moving away.
Oh, uh... that's -- that's a bummer.
yeah? - well, yeah.
so... guess this is good-bye.
I guess it is.
Anna, your face!
it's nothing.
it didn't look like nothing.
you didn't have to hit him that hard.
Yes, I did.
grab him, and let's go.
I'm taking him to meet my mother.
swoop!
Hey!
Where's your date?
who knows?
Ah, is the honeymoon over already?
maybe.
after all that grief you gave me about liking her.
I figured it would have lasted longer than five minutes.
look, I just -- I don't know if I can do the whole public couple thing.
she --she seems like she might be a little clingy.
well, good. I need my boy single anyway.
incoming.
Hey. There you are.
here I am.
Yeah, well, I'm not drunk enough, so I'm just going to go get another beer.
so...
so.
I have another speech.
OK.
the hand thing with Elena, it was lame.
well, I was lame.
and, hey, your feelings for Elena aside, damon was there, and he was always such a jerk to me.
and...
I wanted to show off that I was with the good guy.
so, anyway, I was lame.
so... Forgiven?
Yeah, of course. Yeah.
what are they saying?
sounds Latin.
I don't think it's Latin.
what's happening?
it worked!
of course it worked.
we have some fires to build.
I'm gonna go get the gasoline, I'll be right back.
you ready?
what?
you think I'm going to go in there by myself so you can seal me in?
don't take her in, I'll bring the walls down.
you'll bring walls down if I don't. You think I trust you?
as much as I trust you. -- Enough! Both of you.
look, he needs leverage. He needs to know that you're not going to shut the door when he gets inside.
I get it. I'll go.
may I?
dark down there?
I thought I told you to leave.
I considered it.
then I thought, screw you.
Hey, hero.
I'm going down there to get my mother.
can't let you do that.
well, ben's about to make a main course out of Elena's little brother, so you can stop me or him.
your choice.
what is that?
they can sense you.
now where is she?!
Hey, you're not going in there.
you think you can stop me?
why did you let her go in?
because she isn't coming out, baby.
none of them are.
do you really think that she cares about you?
you're disposable.
I don't care. she already gave me what I want.
you're going to say "eternal life"?
you're really that stupid?
you know, I've heard about you.
you don't feed.
you're not strong enough to beat me.
is that all you got?
no.
I got this.
Where's Elena?
Damon took her inside.
What?! Stefan!
if you go in there, you won't come out.
what did you do?
opening the door didn't remove the seal, it just opened the door.
what's the seal? Some seals keep vampires from entering.
this one keeps them from... coming out.
Elena's human. She can leave.
Anna and Katherine can't. Damon can't.
you weren't even planning on breaking the spell, were you?
I told you.
I'll protect my own.
Elena can get out. That's all that matters.
you must have a taste for it.
you scream and shriek and even bother to escape, but then you just come right back to it.
mother!
your boyfriend did this, you know.
his father did.
and Jonathan Gilbert.
made a choice a long time ago that it would be Gilbert blood that brought her back to life.
I had Jeremy all ready to go, but...
you can't just leave him inhere, grams!
he made his choice!
no.
here.
just tell me what to do. I'll do it!
we are not strong enough.
even if we were able to bring the seal down, there's no guarantee that we can get it back up again.
you said it yourself --many things can fuel a witch's power.
help me!
or I'll do it alone.
please don't!
you let her go!
No!
go, go. I'll be right behind you.
mama where am I?
he's right behind me.
Stefan, what are you doing?
it's gonna be ok. We'll fix it.
what is it?
I can't.
can't? Can't what?
the spell's still up, we can't get them out yet.
you went in there not knowing if you could come back out?
Oh, my god.
I heard you scream.
we can't leave him in there. We promised him, both of us.
I know.
even if we're able to break through the seal, we won't be able to hold it for long.
she's not here!
Damon. -- She's not here.
what?
she's not here!
I think it's working!
I just wanted my mother back.
Jeremy's fine. He's outside. We won't touch him.
Bonnie, keep going!
you better hurry.
Stefan, they can't hold it much longer!
Damon, we need to get out of here.
it doesn't make sense. They locked her inside.
if we don't leave now, we're not getting out.
how could she not be in here?
it's not worth spending all of eternity down here! She's not worth it! -- No!
please.
Oh, my god!
I can't!
Yes, you can!
is this for real?
is what for real?
you being all cool and honest and open?
speech number three?
I want this to work.
and I'm scared that you're going to change your mind and you're not going to want it.
I don't want to mess it up.
I don't want to mess it up, either.
he's ok.
he's all right.
I'm sorry.
Hey, let me help you.
Oh, I'm fine. You don't need to coddle me, baby.
it was a big spell, grams.
I could tell it took a lot out of you.
I'll be fine.
how's your head?
it's, uh, it's all right. I just --I wish I knew how I pass out.
I didn't drink that much, I swear and you don't remember anything?
the whole thing's pretty cloudy. I just...
I know how this looks. I'm --I'm sorry.
no, Jeremy, don't be sorry. You didn't do anything, ok?
OK.
I've gotta head over to Bonnie's for a little bit, but is there anything that you need?
Oh, no, I'm just -- I'm gonna crash.
OK. well, Jenna's here, and I'll be back soon.
you knew Katherine wasn't in there.
you wouldn't have helped me.
No!
why do you get happiness?
Damon, please, you wouldn't have helped me! You know you wouldn't!
why do you get it and I don't?!
she promised to turn him, he was obsessed with her.
she had him under her spell, like everybody else!
he let her go.
the last I saw her was chicago. 1983.
she knew where you were, Damon.
she didn't care.
sorry.
I just got the Bonnie's.
everything all right?
Yeah.
how's Damon? Is he going to be ok?
I don't know.
can I call you later?
Yeah, of course.
wake up, grams.
grams?
grams, wake up!
grams!
Grams?!
wake up!
she's not breathing! She's not breathing!
please, wake up!
Yes, I need an ambulance. It's 2 Oak Street.
it's an emergency. Quick!
Bonnie! -- no, no! I can fix this!
Bonnie! -- grams, I can fix this!
for over a century, I have lived in secret,
until now. I know the risk, But I have to know her.
Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
why do I look like her? - You were adopted.
this girl showed up. She was 16 and about to give birth.
what else do you know about her? - Just her name, Isobel.
my wife Isobel spent her life. Researching paranormal activity in this area.
Where's your wife? - Damon killed her.
there's a tomb underneath the church.
the spell sealed Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.
I'm gonna bring her back.
she's not here!
you knew Katherine wasn't in there.
she knew where you were, and she didn't care.
Jeez! You scared me.
do you know what day it is?
it's Saturday. - And what year?
it's 2010. Are you ok? - Thank you.
wait, what's your name? - It's Harper, sir.
how did you get out here?
and why are you dressed like that?
you seem like a very nice person.
I'm sorry. - Sorry for what?
Hey, Bonnie, it's me just checking in, Seeing how you're doing. We miss you here.
don't let your aunt drive you too crazy.
come home soon. Love you.
what are you doin' out here?
it's cold. - Thinking, writing.
the, uh, funeral for Bonnie's grandma,
it brought back a lot about mom and dad.
I was wondering. You said that you would do some digging about them, - The adoption. - Right.
so did you? Dig?
come on inside.
your dad kept everything from his medical practice
records, logs, Old appointment books.
I found an entry from the night you were born.
patient and a birth date. Isobel Peterson.
do you think that's her real name?
pregnant teenage runaway? Probably not.
first name, maybe.
but where'd she get Peterson? Classmate? Best friend?
so I binged it.
I searched for all the Petersons in this area Born the same year as Isobel, found 3
2 men and a woman, Trudie,
who lived in grove hill, virginia.
that's not far from here. - Well, watch this.
she was a cheerleader.
trudie still lives there.
this is her address.
what about Isobel?
I couldn't find anything about her.
listen. There's something else.
Mr. Saltzman, Rick, His wife was from around here,
and her name was also Isobel.
wait. "was," as in...
she died.
Alaric's wife might have been your mother?
it can't be true, right? I mean, the coincidence alone is just crazy.
I have the address for her friend Trudie.
you wanna talk to her.
I don't know. I... I--I don't know.
if it's true and they are the same person,
that means that my birth mother is dead,
and I don't know if I could handle that.
Elena, did Jenna tell you anything about Alaric's wife?
how she died?
just that she was killed and the case was never solved.
you knew that already?
the night at the school when he attacked me,
he told me some things about her death.
well-- no, no. It's not possible.
the coincidence is-- it's too much.
now, listen, if you do decide to go Talk to Isobel's friend, I'll go with you. Ok?
I just don't know what I'm gonna do yet.
I should get goin'. I gotta go deal with Damon.
how's he doing? - He's dealing in his own way.
how do I taste?
Oh, so much better than your friends.
but shh. Don't tell them. They might get jealous.
no. Buzzkill bob.
greetings. - Can we talk?
yeah.- Without the tri-delts.
anything you have to say to me, You can say in front of them.
they're really good at keeping secrets.
you're worried about me. That's nice. Don't be.
there's no need. I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?
spent the last 145 years with one goal,
get in that tomb. I succeeded.
granted, Katherine wasn't in there to be rescued, But why dwell?
no, it's so liberating not having a master plan,
because I can do whatever the hell I want.
that's kind of what I'm afraid of.
relax. I haven't killed anyone in-- too long.
those girls? - Will end up in their dorm with headaches,
think they blacked out. Business as usual.
predictable you didn't pull me over here for a pep talk.
so drink up. Spill it, brother.
there was a woman you may have known a few years back
named Isobel in North Carolina at Duke.
you wanna discuss the women in my past right now? Seriously?
you killed her. - What's your point?
I just--just wanna know if you remember anything about her.
Oh, it's like a needle in a haystack, Stefan.
well, think hard. It's important.
nothing is important, not anymore.
great chat.
I have to go and exploit some women in the name of grief,
which I'm sure you understand.
ttfn," said the tri-delt.
what?
this is boring. I'm bored.
but we have this entire house to ourselves.
I mean, it's practically a bachelor pad.
and...
so shouldn't we do something a little bit more bachelor-paddy?
what? Something like this?
something like that. - I don't know.
this is a pretty good show. - Seriously?
Oh, god. Not on my couch.
mom.
I don't know. It's just weird, you know,
me being raffled off like a disney cruise.
in this town，fundraising is like indentured servitude.
you don't have a choice. Besides, you're a bachelor,
and you're eligible, so there you go.
here. Let me help you with this.
Oh, god. I can't believe I'm gonna do this.
what?
I am totally gonna ruin this moment,
but I--I have to tell you.
Elena recently found out she was adopted, And she's been looking for her birth mother...
whose name was Isobel. - Isobel? Like my wife?
Isobel never had a baby. - Are you sure?
not before you were together?
Nope. No way.
this is Elena's birth mother.
Ah, she, uh-- She never told me.
I, uh-- I'm gonna go.
Yeah, I'm gonna-- gonna go.
Trudie? Tru-Trudie Peterson?
Yes. - Uh, my name is Elena Gilbert.
I wanted to talk to you about Isobel Flemming.
well, I haven't heard that name in years.
how do you know her?
I think that, um, well...
do you know if she had a baby that she gave up for adoption?
my god. You're her daughter.
I was just gonna make some tea. Would you like some?
sure. - Uh, the kitchen's this way.
I wasn't gonna come. I didn't think I was,
but I was driving, and I hit this stoplight,
and it made me think about when I was learning how to drive and then my mom would always warn me
about this blind turn on the left-hand side,
and then I was thinking about my mom, and
I had your address. I'm sorry for barging in.
it's no problem. Just a surprise, though.
I haven't thought about Isobel in years.
when was the last time you saw her?
about 17 years ago, When she left to go have you.
we kept in touch for a while, But, well, you know, people drift apart.
and you don't know where she ended up?
she was in Florida for a while.
she was on her own. I know it wasn't easy.
do you have any idea who my father is?
I could never get her to fess up.
anyway, she finally pulled it together,
got into college on a scholarship.
where did she go? - Somewhere in North Narolina.
Duke, I think. Smart girl, smart school.
let me just grab that.
so it's been a few months. Where you been?
Ah, you know, here and there. Never one place too long.
you know Pete. - No, actually, I don't,
because you never brought him around.
so blonde's the new flavor of the month, huh?
so sorry I scared her off.
she's not a flavor, mom. I like her.
so she's the one? - No, probably not, but maybe.
Matt, seriously, Lezzie Forbes' daughter? Uh.
mom, seriously, Knock it off.
ice, please.
so, uh, you heard from Vic?
no, but don't worry.
she'll come home eventually when she needs something.
I played that game. - Are you playing it now?
no. - Then what are you doing home?
you trying to say I need a reason to come back?
sit down. Eat with me.
tell me everything I've missed, hmm.
thanks for meeting me. Something's come up.
Jenna told you. - Yeah.
so it's true. Your wife Isobel was Elena's birth mother.
what does Elena know?
about your wife?
about everything. About you, your brother.
she knows what I am, And she knows that you know about the vampires.
does she know about Damon and Isobel?
no. I couldn't tell her, not until I was sure.
you said you'd help me.
I asked Damon without saying too much. He doesn't remember.
ask him again.
Damon is not stable right now.
you know, he murdered my wife. Or at the very least made a meal out of her.
when has he been stable? - I'm telling you not to push this.
give me a reason not to.
your survival. How's that for a reason?
I'll handle it, but for now, I need you to let it go.
is that what you'll tell Elena?
let it go?
leave Elena out of this.
I need to know what happened.
I think you would, too.
I need something more than just your wife's name,
a picture, something I could show Damon.
just a few more minutes.- Can't you, uh
can't you finish this in the morning?
but I like working at night.
Yeah. See, I like sleeping at night.
with you.
OK, I'll bite. What is it, thesis stuff?
look, baby, I'm in a 3-way here with you and your computer,
the least you can do is let me know what you're up to.
I was doing research. And I dug up all this stuff
about this small town in virginia near where I grew up.
it's isolated, out of the way, and quiet,
and every now and then, people die mysteriously,
and they say that it's animal attacks.
except, these bodies are drained of blood.
it's vampires. It has to be.
OK. I'll get my garlic and holy water, - And then maybe, just maybe... - No.
we can get some sleep. Come here. -No.
look, this is why I love you,
because you believe in all of this stuff,
so much so that you're making a degree out of it.
you're like mulder, except hotter and a girl.
this is not a joke, Rick.
you think that this is cute, But I'm gonna prove it.
and mulder was right in the end.
Ah. They came to the games for us.
the football team hadn't won in years.
we were the stars. Well, Izzie was.
but I was a damn good backup.
Heh. This is great. Thank you.
you're welcome.
you haven't touched your tea.
Oh. Yeah.
what is this?
Oh, it's just some herbal mixture.
vervain?
you know. Know what?
you didn't invite me in. And you're serving vervain tea.
you know.
I think that you should probably leave.
wait. What are you not telling me?
please leave. Now!
bourbon.
behold the teacher.
don't you have some papers to grade?
it's, uh, more fun with a buzz.
well, most things in life are. Sober's depressing.
you don't strike me as somebody who gets depressed.
you say that like you know me.
Nope. Just a hunch.
you have a good afternoon. - Not likely.
daytime drinking, huh? - It's all the rage.
listen, I need a favor. - You ever been in love?
excuse me? Have you ever been so bent on someone,
that you just have your heart ripped out by them?
you forget I was married. - Right. Gay husband.
she'll have what I'm having. Sit down.
there's a fundraiser here tonight. That the founder's council is throwing.
the town's most eligible bachelors get raffled off for dates,
and, well, we're short a bachelor.
is this what you do when there's no, um...
vampires? Organize bachelor raffles?
Oh, trust me. At this point, I miss the vampires.
look, you're a hero to this town, Damon.
I know most people don't know it,
but you are, and you're single and a catch.
Oh, come on. Help me out.
Carol Lockwood won't let me live it down if I come up empty-handed.
you know, a room full of women clamoring to win a date with me
sounds tasty.
thank you. - One thing.
can you get information on someone for me?
Alaric Saltzman, the history teacher.
there's just something a little off about him,
and I just-- I just wanna make sure that the high school did their homework on this guy.
you got it. - Thanks.
may I help you? - Thank you for the text.
you're welcome. I didn't tell her anything.
I--I kept my promise.- Good.
the girl, though, She--she knew something.
that won't be a problem. She won't get any closer to the truth.
good. So I'm done?
Yes. You're done.
No! I won't invite you in.
you can't come in!
I'm not a vampire, so, yes, I can.
I don't understand.
I did what you told me. I did my part!
and now I have to do mine.
Stefan. - Better.
me. - You look, um...
dashing? Gorgeous? Irresistible?
wrecked.
you look wrecked. - No reason why.
do you know that I am one of mystic falls' most eligible bachelors?
huh. - Yep.
how are you doing? - Never better. Yep.
what can I do for you?
I'm a barrel of favors today.
it's my newfound purpose - how can I help people?
I'm just meeting Stefan. We're going to the fundraiser.
help a guy out, will you? Can't get this.
so I found out who my birth mother is.
eh. Who cares?
she left you. She sucks.
Stefan. There you are.
Uhh. I need a bigger jacket. Wow. You know,
an occasional sorority girl might, um,
you know, help fill you out a little bit.
he's fine. - He's Damon.
maybe this heartache will be good for him.
it'll remind him that he has one, even if it doesn't beat.
won't hold my breath.
so I went to see Trudie Peterson.
I know. I'm sorry. I didn't plan it.
how was it? - She has vervain.
she knows about vampire stuff. And it can't be a coincidence.
it isn't. This is Alaric's wife.
this is her. This is Isobel. He gave this to you?
everything he knows about vampires, he learned from her.
he believes that she was killed by one.
Oh, my god.
listen, Elena, there's a lot About Isobel that Alaric can tell you,
but I need you to hold off a little while. Before you talk to him.
Why? - I know that it's a lot to ask of you,
but will you do that for me?
tickets for the raffle are now on sale.
all proceeds benefit the annual founder's day celebration.
that's a good look for you.
what? Embarrassing and uncomfortable?
Yep. That's-- that's the one.
Hey, look. I'm, uh, sorry about earlier.
it was just kind of a--a shock.
well, I'm sorry for dropping it on you,
but I felt like you should know.
no, I get it. - At some point, maybe you and Elena could talk.
I'm sure she'd like to hear about Isobel, what she was like.
Yeah. Uh... - Or not. No pressure.
I don't know if that's a--a great idea.
at least not--not for a while.
Where'd our girlfriend go? - She's on her way to the grill.
I, uh, wanted to talk to you.
this is the woman, Isobel,
from north carolina. Remember her now?
who wants to know? - I do.
who else wants to know?
did you kill her? - Sorry. Don't know her.
Hey, are you comin'?
the real housewives of mystic falls await.
he's already been hit on, like, 35 times.
he's total cougar bait.
impressive. - More like embarrassing.
Heh heh. Hi, mrs. Donovan.
Elena, honey. - Hi, kelly.
long time, no see. - How are you doing?
Oh, same old. Oh. Matty tells me you broke his heart.
mom. - Just kidding. Calm down.
he found his rebound girl. Oh. Here you go, sweetheart.
however many that'll buy.
I just hope I don't get bachelor 3. I dated him in high school.
not impressive.
in any way.
very exciting.
I've got the big date planned.
it's a romantic dinner. Secluded spot somewhere woodsy.
you're making me think I should buy a ticket.
well, you are in charge. You could always rig it.
pardon me.
I ran the check on the history teacher.
you want this before or after your big debut?
how's it look? - He checks out.
couple of speeding tickets.
it's a rough story, though. Turns out his wife went missing a few years back in north carolina.
north carolina? She have a name?
Yeah. Isobel.
and what do you do, bachelor number 3?
Yeah, I'm a plumber. - Well, isn't that wonderful?
we could always use more plumbers.
moving on.
number 4,"Alaric saltzman."Wow. That's quite a mouthful.
what do you do, Alaric?
I'm a teacher at Mystic Falls High.
Oh, beauty and brains, ladies.
this one's a keeper. What do you teach?
history. - History.
Oh, well, give us a fun fact. About Mystic Falls, something crazy.
uh, well...
he probably saving the best stories for his date.
and last, but not least, Damon Salvatore.
we don't have much on you. - Well, I'm tough to fit on a card.
do you have any hobbies, like to travel?
Oh, yeah. L. A.new york.
couple of years ago, I was in north carolina,
near the duke campus, actually. I think--I think Alaric when to school there.
didn't you, Rick?
yeah,'cause I-- I know your wife did.
I had a drink with her once.
she was--she was a great girl.
I ever tell you that? 'cause she was
she-- Delicious.
are you ok? - I just need some air.
Elena. - He killed her?
Damon was the vampire that killed her?
I don't know what happened. Alaric said that they never found the body.
Oh, my god. Stefan.
I know. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you,
but I just-- I wanted to know more.
I was feeling sorry for him,
hoping that this whole Katherine thing would change him.
I'm so stupid.
he doesn't know about the connection to you.
I thought about confronting him, but he's already so on edge.
why are you protecting him?
because you're not the only one hoping that he might actually change.
that man.
I saw that man outside of Trudie's.
get back inside. Come on.
and bachelor number 3 goes to 37458.
Ah. Kelly Donovan. Lovely.
you and the plumber should have so much fun.
congratulations, mrs. Donovan.
OK, just stop. Stop trying so hard.
this thing you're doing, this nice thing, it's fake,
like you, like your mom,
and for some reason, matt fell for it, But that doesn't mean that I will.
I don't like you, ok?
so tell plumber boy I'll be at the bar.
OK. Whoa. Easy there.
buy a ticket like everyone else.
did you enjoy that? Rubbing it in to Alaric Saltzman?
what?
just as I was starting to think that there Was something redeemable about you.
Elena. - Am I missing something here?
did I forget to mention earlier when we were talking
about my birth mother, The one that gave me up?
her name was Isobel.
go ahead. Reminisce about how you killed her.
come on. Let's get you home.
I have a message for you.
what? - Who are you?
stop looking. - Stop looking for what?
she doesn't want to know you. She doesn't want to talk to you.
you need to stop looking. Do you understand?
she's alive? Does that mean she's a
Elena, he's under a compulsion.
do you understand? - Yes. I do.
good.
I'm done now.
come on. Let's get out of here.
37649. - That's me.
Congratulations.
and bachelor number 5, Damon salvatore.
37552
would you look at that. 37552.
what are the chances? Me.
Where'd he go? - I'm gonna call you later.
I think it's time to let this vampire crap go.
I mean, the research, the trips, it's become an obsession.
well, this is important to me, Rick.
Why? Why is it so important?
explain it to me. I mean, make me understand.
I mean, what's the point of this?
you don't want kids. You're barely ever home.
I just want us to be normal people.
maybe I don't want to.
maybe I want more.
here we go. Home, sweet home.
wait. Why--why are we back here? I wasn't ready to leave.
Yeah, you were, mom.
you're the best, matty. - I know.
I'm--I'm sorry... I was gone so long.
why are you really home, mom?
it's Pete. He's gone,
and it's all my fault. I did it. I always do it.
no, you didn't, mom. It's not your fault.
you're all I have left.
please don't leave me. - I'm not goin' anywhere.
are you really this stupid?
guess so.
you gonna put down the stake?
that's courage. - Where's Isobel?
what have you done to my wife?
you want me to tell you I killed her? Would that make you happy?
because I think you know what happened.
I saw you feeding on her. - Yeah. I did, and I wasn't lying.
she was delicious.
Oh, come on. What do you think happened?
not an inkling?
never considered the possibility?
I turned her.
Why?
she came to me, all pathetic. Looking for vampires.
there was something about her. Something I liked.
there was something special. - You turned her because you liked her?
no, I slept with her because I liked her.
I turned her because she begged me to.
Yeah. But you knew that, too, didn't you?
hmm. I guess she wasn't happy at home,
wasn't happy with life in general,
wasn't happy with you.
Ah, this is a shame.
we're kindred spirits, abandoned by the women we love.
unrequited love sucks.
sounds like I got a lung.
which means I get to sit here and watch you die.
what happened? What did you do?
dude, what? He attacked me. - Damon.
all I did was tell him the truth. His wife didn't want him anymore.
it's not my fault he couldn't handle it.
like you've been handling Katherine?
I'm handling it fine. You know what?
Isobel came to me. She found me.
and if she's related to Elena,
that means she's related to Katherine.
maybe Katherine sent her to me.
stop it. You don't have to keep looking.
can't be a coincidence Isobel sought me out.
can't.
I'm assuming you'll take care of this.
what happened? What's going on?
you were just... Did Damon turn you?
no. I went for him. And then he stabbed me.
no, no, no. You must have vampire blood in your system. Somebody slipped it to you.
no. It's... it's something else.
then how? - I...
surprise gifts aren't fair.
I always feel bad for not getting you something.
just open it.
Oh, that's a giant piece of jewelry.
I know. It's ridiculous. Just tell people it's a family heirloom.
nobody questions that. - Where'd you get this?
if I told you, you'd laugh at me.
but promise me that you'll always wear it.
it'll protect you from all the things that go bump in the night.
a ring to ward off the demons, eh?
consider it a-- a token of my love,
my affection, and if nothing else, An apology for being so crazy.
well, you were definitely crazy.
I'm selfish, and I'm obsessed. And I'm a horrible wife.
but you love me anyway.
Yes, I do.
this ring protected me.
that's impossible. I know.
was there a problem?
did you find her? What's going on?
it's Harper.
I'm glad you found us.
ms. Gibbons. This gentleman is a friend of mine.
may he come in?
any friend of Pearl's is a friend of mine.
please do. Come in.
Annabelle, close the door, please.
for over a century, I have lived in secret...
until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
as a founding family member,
I find it's my duty to report some very distressing news.
he's a gilbert?
Elena's uncle.
mayor lockwood, is it?
my name is pearl. - hi.
this is my daughter anna.
maybe there is such a thing as vampires.
they're just different from the way we always thought they were.
you got a problem with blood, anna?
the coroner's office has officially ruled Vicki Donovan's death a drug overdose.
I don't think it was an overdose. - Jer, just let it go, ok?
is there something you're not telling me?
take my wrist, you need more blood.
I have this hunger inside of me that I've never...
I've never felt before in my entire life.
I don't want you to see me like this.
I don't want you to know that this side of me exists.
nice car.
I thought it was a waste to leave it sitting in the garage.
I didn't know you were coming back today.
you know, I woke up this morning and I was feeling great, and I figured it was time for me to get back into things.
does the mean you're ok now?
with all the cravings? - Yeah.
I mean, the worst part is over.
so...
now all I want to do is just spend as much time with you as possible.
I'm ok with that.
Hey, thank you.
for helping me get through the...
the rough patch.
you're welcome.
we're going to be late.
OK, um, you know what, i'll catch up with you. I'm gonna grab my stuff.
I'll be right behind you.
OK. - ok.
there was a disturbance at the hospital blood bank last night.
some of the supply was compromised.
compromised? You mean stolen.
we almost missed it.
the inventory records were altered, but when the night manager was questioned, he had no recollection of changing them.
meaning the vampire who stole the blood used mind control to hide the theft.
I know what she meant. - We wouldn't have noticed if John not alerted us to recent discrepancies at other hospital blood banks in the county.
how lucky for us, we have John.
we're stepping up security at the hospital, giving the guards vervain to prevent this from happening again.
sheriff, might I offer a suggestion?
why don't Damon and I put our heads together?
we can track down whoever's doing this.
truthfully, I could use the extra hands.
is that something you'd be willing to do?
well, of course, I mean, if it'll help.
I think we'll make a good team.
don't you, Damon?
John, whatever I can do to help keep this town safe, even if it means spending time with you.
OK.
this week we're going to set aside our regular curriculum for a lesson in local history as we approach founder's day.
apparently the community leaders feel that's more important than world war ii, but hey, what do I know?
sorry I'm late.
looks like we will be at full occupancy today. Welcome home, bonnie.
right, founder's day.
what does it mean to have a founder's day?
well, if you'll turn your attention to this exquisite diorama over here that I spent all night...
I suppose I should be grateful you learned how to use the bell.
I'm here on behalf of my mother.
on behalf of or in spite of?
I'm sorry about what the other vampires did to Stefan.
abducting him, torturing him.
it wasn't supposed to go down like that.
you were playing house with half of a tomb of really pissed off vampires.
what did you think was going to happen? - My mom is devastated.
they tried to overthrow her.
why isn't she here telling me this?
she doesn't really do apologies.
well, that's a coincidence, 'cause I don't forgive, so just run along.
and if you're going to continue playing house with your little vampire pets, you might want to stop robbing the blood bank dry, because they're onto it.
I haven't been to the local blood bank in at least a week.
then it's one of your others. - The other ones are gone, Damon.
well, where'd they go?
they weren't cut out for this town.
after what happened with your brother, my mom kicked them out and they took off.
it's just us and Harper now.
Hey, I, um, I tried to grab you after class but you'd already taken off.
how are you?
how's your family? - We're dealing. It's been hard.
everyone here really missed you. - Yeah,
I just had so much to deal with after grams' funeral, and honestly after you told me that the tomb's spell failed,
I just didn't really want to come back.
I hope you understand why I called.
I wanted you to know before you came home.
Yeah, I understand why. I just wish I didn't know.
I know it's been really hard...
thank god you're home!
I know we talked every day, but I missed you!
how are you doing?
better. Just better. You know, just glad to be back, and try to keep myself busy.
well, I can help with that.
major wardrobe confab needed asap.
you need to help me pick the perfect dress for the founder's court.
the founder's court? Did I miss something?
the founder's court.
you know, Miss Mystic Falls.
they announced it today, and, um, you and are both on it.
Oh, my god, we signed up for that so long ago.
I completely forgot. - Yeah.
so are you dropping out, then?
I can't.
no?
her mom is the one who wanted her to enter.
how was school?
fine.
yeah?
same old, same old?
nothing new?
no stories to bring home?
you're making small talk, why?
you seem awfully chipper lately. Less doom and gloom, a little more pep in your step.
and you think it's because I drank human blood again.
I mean, I don't want to brag, but I would definitely take responsibility for this new and improved you.
right, right. Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but I'm clean.
Yeah, not possible.
not only is it possible, but it is quite true.
Stefan, let's be serious for a second.
you spent the last century and a half being a poster child for prozac, and now you expect me to believe that this new you has nothing to do with human blood, nothing.
I'm clean.
you're lying!
believe what you want.
I'm sorry for the short notice.
I didn't even know that the contest was coming up, much less that I would be in it.
well, I'll be happy to escort you anywhere.
my mom was really into this founder's day stuff.
she was even Miss Mystic in her day.
I kinda wanted to do it for her.
well, it'll be great. We'll have fun.
OK.
I'll see tomorrow. I love you.
love you, too.
well, well.
he's a liar and a thief.
So...When were you going to share?
go ahead.
help yourself. - No, no,
I'm talking about the fact that you're a closet blood nknk.
so I'm drinking blood again.
you're the one that shoved it on me. What's your problem?
I have it under control.
under control?
you robbed the hospital.
so what's your point?
fine.
whatever, man. Drink up.
just remember we're trying to keep a low profile.
why don't you just walk up to sheriff forbes, ask her to tap a vein.
have my actions negatively impacted you?
I can't imagine what that must feel like.
Yeah, what's Elena think about the new...You?
Noing's changed. I'm still the same person.
clearly. - Elena doesn't need to know anything yet.
you've been off the human stuff for years, Stefan.
if you're having trouble controlling... - I'm not having any trouble.
who do you think you're talking to?
I know what it's like.
that jekyll and hyde feeling.
there's that switch, sometimes it goes off and you snap.
right now is not a good time for me to be worried about you snapping.
I know that it pains you to see this.
but I'm fine, ok?
I'm fine.
so please, do me a favor.
and back off.
this year's queen will have the special honor of taking center stage at the 150th founder's day gala.
before we crown our winner, we'd like to get to know a bit more about each of you.
I'm on the M. F. Beautification Committee.
I volunteer at the relief center soup kitchen. - I recognize that
I haven't been as involved this year as I used to be.
I implemented this year's go green campaign at school.
I've been distracted, and I let a lot of things slide.
I don't think it's wrong for me to win 2 years in a row.
I was surprised to have been selected.
since I'm not from one of the founding families. - But I'm aware of what an honor this is, and I want you to know that I take it seriously.
worked with the county's recycling program and was in charge of the policemen's yearly raffle.
just because my dul made my community service mandatory, - doesn't mean I was any less committed. - This was really important to my mother.
she believed in community, family, honor and loyalty.
it's the legacy she ft for me.
Hey, partner. - What do you want?
you haven't returned any of my calls.
most people take that as a hint.
why don't we start looking for vampires?
why the act, John? I mean, you obviously don't care about catching vampires.
you're here talking to me.
actually, I care very much.
what did isobel say about that? I mean, considering that she is one.
Isobel and I share a mutual interest.
the original Johnathan Gilbert had an invention that was stolen by a vampire.
that vampire was then burned alive in Fell's church, or so Johnathan thought.
and the invention was lost forever.
but then the vampires weren't killed, were they?
they were trapped.
and now they're free, thanks to you, which means the invention is retrievable.
well, what is it?
the only thing that matters is that I want it back, and you're going to help me if you want your secret safe.
I mean, why bring me into it, John?
I mean, I don't even know what you're talking about, much less who has it.
Oh, come on, Damon.
you were around back then.
you know who these people are, what they look like.
he was friendly with a woman who turned out to be a vampire.
her name was pearl.
does that ring a bell?
I'm not playing anymore.
get out. Get out.
I beg your pardon? - You know,
I only entertain this whole blackmail scheme thing of yours because I thought that you and isobel could lead me to katherine.
but see, now I know you have no idea where katherine is, because if you did, you would know that katherine and pearl were best friends.
see, you don't know everything, do you, John?
I'll tell the entire council what you are. - Go for it.
I'll kill every last one of them.
then I'll sever your hand, pull your ring off, and I'll kill you, too.
do you understand that?
honor your partner.
let's focus.
right hand around.
flirt with your eyes.
left hand around.
this is ridiculous. - Both hands.
you're only saying that because you don't know how to do it.
sorry only one of us was around when the dance was invented.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
there's no touching during this part.
it's about the simple intimacy of the near-touch.
very nice, Amber.
thank you, mrs. Lockwood!
if you ask me, the near touch is overrated.
you seem to be in a good mood.
is that a bad thing?
would you prefer me to be brooding and tortured?
Hey, I'm not complaining.
Oh, no touching.
the fell cousins don't have a shot.
and Amber Bradley is only on the court so the pageant doesn't look like it's founding families only.
which, of course, it is.
so that leaves Elena.
she totally has the sympathy vote since her parents died.
how can I compete with that?
very nice.
very sensitive. - Oh, I'm sorry.
this must sound really unimportant in light of everything.
it's ok. I get it.
you want to win.
well, my grandmother was Miss Mystic.
and both of my aunts.
my mom's the only one who didn't get the gene, and I want this.
I mean, I actually deserve this.
Hey.
Hey. How are you?
I begged bonnie to fill in for matt.
he had to work today.
Bonnie, do you have a minute?
we only have 30 minutes for rehearsal. - It'll only take a minute. Please?
Bonnie, you have to tell me what's wrong.
it's not worth talking about.
what do you mean, not worth it?
you've barely said 10 words to me, and you won't even look at Stefan.
is that what it is, is it Stefan?
listen.
Elena, I can't just pretend like everything is ok.
everything my grams did was to protect us from those vampires in the tomb.
and now they're out, which means she died for nothing.
I'm so sorry, bonnie.
what can I do to make it better?
that's just it.
there's nothing you can do.
I blame him, Elena.
him and Damon.
and I'm not going to put you in a situation where you have to choose sides.
I'm just having a hard time with it. ok?
dude, are you ok?
you're bleeding.
are you ok? - Yes.
I'm sorry.
I was just.
I was feeling a little sick.
I'll be fine.
I heard you're driving. - Yeah, I am.
let me get that for you.
Thanks. - Yeah.
um, how, uh...
how is Stefan?
what do you mean?
you know, he seems on edge.
he went through a lot, he was in bad shape for a while.
but he's bouncing back now.
Hey, buddy. What are you doing here?
well, I'm the chauffer.
Oh, I thought I was driving.
Oh, no need. We're going with rick.
are we ready?
Jeremy can ride with you.
in the running for Miss Mystic Malls?
Somememis you have to wear uncomfortable heels to blend in.
I remember this event from 1864.
I was supposed to enter, before everything happened.
ahh, nostalgia's a bitch.
if you're just going to mock me, then you move along, please.
John Gilbert thinks your mom stole an artifact from Johnathan Sr. Back in 1864.
what are you, his errand boy?
I don't know what it is, but I don't want him to have it.
I could ask her.
but, you know, you've made it pretty clear that you don't trust us, so why should I even bother?
because you want to stay in Mystic Falls, and John gilbert's in town, making that impossible.
find out where it is.
he leaves, you can buy a welcome mat.
thanks for helping me.
don't thank me until you're sure your hair isn't going to burn off.
you know, I remember when my mom and I were first applying for this.
she was so excited.
so were you, if I recall.
I was.
she just made it sound like so much fun.
lots has changed since then.
well, I hate to break it to you, but it's a little late for cold feet.
I don't have cold feet. I just...
I think I'd be enjoying it a lot more if she was here.
I'll tell you one thing, your hair would have a better chance if she was.
OK, I should go put my dress on.
be careful with that thing.
don't hurt anybody.
you look miserable.
are there really a whole month of these events that I'm supposed to show up at?
you can fight it if you want, but it's part of being a Gilbert.
Yeah, you, uh, you mentioned you know a lot about the family.
do you know anything about our ancestor Johnathan Gilbert?
prolific writer, crazy inventor.
why do you ask?
well, I read his journal.
is that right?
Yeah. I actually found it in all dad's stuff.
well, that's surprising.
most of them are locked away.
there's more of them? - Johnathan gilbert journaled his whole life.
right down to the bitter, insane drunken end.
guy had a lot of demons.
and did you read 'em?
I browsed, yeah.
What'd you think about what he wrote?
crazy ramblings of a mad man, of course.
Yeah.
well, she's very pretty.
Yeah, yeah, she's a, uh, a friend of mine.
excuse me.
are you ok, Amber?
I hate being the center of attention.
I get panic attacks.
do you need some privacy so you can change?
actually, I'm just...I'm just going to go get some air.
Hey.
you can't be back here.
we need to talk.
does it have to be right now?
normally I would have a completely different outlook on what I'm about to tell you, but since it could really inconvenience me, i'll squeal.
what are you talking about?
Stefan's still drinking human blood.
what? - Yeah.
a month ago, I would have rejoiced.
but with the council back on the alert, it is not a good time for Stefan to fly off the handle.
I know he's been a little edgy, but he said that was normal.
he has a fridge full of stolen blood bank contraband in the house.
Oh, my god.
he has no idea what normal is.
his entire existence isn't normal.
normal to a vampire is drinking human blood.
but he spent all this time fighting it when he should have been learning how to ctrtrol it.
and now it's controlling him instead.
I can't believe this. I mean, it's Stefan that we're talking about here.
Stefan on human blood, Elena.
he'll do anything, he'll say anything, because he's not going to want to stop.
trust me.
what is it?
come on, don't be like that.
why not?
you're basically using me to turn you into a vampire so you could be with someone else.
no, I wasn't using you.
Really?
then how would you like to define it?
look, I don't think it's any worse than becoming friends with me so you could give your mother my blood.
how do you know that?
that's not important.
seriously, Jeremy.
what do you know?
everything.
I know everything.
this is all my fault. I'm the one who fed him the blood in the first place.
what's going on in here?
just filling Elena in on your extracurricular activities.
what are you talking about?
I know about the blood, Stefan.
I'm gonna.I'll be downstairs, drinking.
I was going to tell you.
when?
I'm fine.
I'm fine. The blood, it doesn't change anything.
it's changing you.
why, because I kept it a secret from you?
come on, Elena.
look, given the way that you're reacting right now, can you really blame me for doing that?
are you hearing yourself right now?
you've been stealing blood and lying, and you say that everything's fine?
everything's not fine, Stefan.
so what, so you and Damon all of a sudden have everything figured out then?
it's not about Damon.
it's about what's happening to you.
I know, and I'm telling you that I'm fine.
I'm fine.
please, come on.
Elena, I thought you...
I thought you believed in me.
Elena? Let's go. The line up's starting.
I just...I need a minute.
you're not even dressed yet.
escorts wait downstairs, Stefan.
God!
Oh, god, sorry!
ms. Tina Fell, escorted by Bartholomew Whitmore.
has anyone seen Amber?
do you see Stefan down there?
Nope. Just my boring fill-in escort.
what happened to matt?
they wouldn't let him out of work.
Hey, what happened to Stefan?
I don't know. He just disappeared somewhere. I don't know.
what am I doing?
I never should have gone through with this.
what do you mean?
I need to find Stefan. This isn't me. I'm not this person anymore.
uh, no, no, no, no way, no.
you had your chance to drop out.
and believe me, I was all for it.
because there is no way that I can beat you.
Elena, you're doing this because it was important to your mom.
ms. Caroline Forbes, and her escort Jeffrey Lockwood Hamilton.
Elena, you're next. Come on.
you're missing Elena's introduction.
I don't care.
so she has no idea you read her journal?
she keeps things from me, i'm going to keep things from her.
what are you going to do now?
now that you know everything that she's been hiding from you?
I don't know.
there's a part of me that's so angry, you know, that she covered up what happened to Vickie and erased my memory, but there's this other part of me that's glad.
I...I don't want to remember Vickie like that.
as a monster?
no, as someone who wanted to hurt me.
when I met you, you were just a part of my plan to get my mother back.
but then things changed.
all the time we spent together.
I would never do anything to hurt you.
not now.
you know that, right?
Yeah, I know that.
where are we going? - I don't know.
I'm in the ceremony.
not now, you're not.
you're standing in the parking lot with me.
I'm in the parking lot with you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm not very good to be around right now. I'm a little bit on edge.
I've.I've been drinking the human stuff and it's really screwing with my head.
she knows now.
God, she wasn't supposed to find out. I didn't want her to find out, now everything's ruined.
you seem sad.
I'm not sad!
I'm freaking hungry!
ms. Elena gilbert, escorted by mr. Stefan salvatore.
Where's Stefan? - I don't know.
what is she doing with Damon?
I have no idea.
what are we going to do? - Right now we just have to get through this.
I don't hurt people.
I don't do that. I'm the good brother.
do you want to hurt me?
I want to kill you.
I want to rip into your skin, and I want to feed on your blood.
under your skin, pulsating, flowing.
your carotid artery, right there.
if you puncture this just right, you can control the blood flow.
it takes practice, but it doesn't have to make a mess.
you don't have to waste any.
what's stopping you?
if I do this, if I give in, there's no going back.
then don't.
I just want one taste. That's all I need. Just one more tast one taste?
Where's Amber? - I don't know.
before I crown the winner, i'd like to offer a personal thank you to all of these young ladies for their efforts to better our communities.
so, without further adieu, it is my honor to announce our very own Miss Mystic Falls, Ms. Caroline Forbes!
Congratulations!
I actually won!
there is blood on the glass.
get me Damon Salvatore.
I can't do this!
what's the matter? - I can't do this.
it's ok.
it doesn't hurt that much.
just not so hard next time.
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god.
I can't stop.
I can't stop.
why aren't you afraid of me, huh?
you told me not to be.
what?
what's your name?
listen to me, Amber.
I need you to be afraid of me.
I need you to run like hell, do you understand me?
run, run, now!
what is it, did you find him?
there were signs of struggle in the upstairs bathroom.
there was blood.
and that Amber girl is missing.
Oh, my god. He wouldn't hurt her.
he won't. - Let's just find him, ok?
let's get your coat, come on.
you said to run!
I changed my mind.
come on. Get control of it. Come on.
it's ok.
come on.
breathe through it, man.
Stefan, stop it!
it's ok.
she doesn't remember what happened.
it's a good thing the girls got here when they did. She lost a lot of blood.
you didn't see anything?
no. We just found her and then called Damon.
she gonna be ok?
looks like it, yeah.
why don't you girls get back to the party.
Damon and I can take it from here. - Yeah.
OK.
they didn't see the bite mark?
no, I got here before they got too close.
there was too much blood, they couldn't see it clearly.
Bonnie, can we talk about this?
there's nothing to talk about.
Bonnie, please.
I told you I wasn't going to make you choose, but I need to make the choice for myself.
please just leave me alone.
Jer. You ready?
uh, just a second.
who's that girl with Jeremy?
his friend anna.
what's her story? - Why so nosy?
I'm just curious. He really seems to like her.
she's new in town, I think.
she and her mom, pearl.
the family you're so rudely trying to prevent from buying Grayson's building.
her mother's name is pearl?
Yes, so?
well, I believe I already know all about her.
Oh, good, there you are. Jenna wanted me to get the car.
what happened?
all right, now this is getting weird.
we're here to talk.
I'm not in the mood. Today's been a no-good, very bad day.
Annabelle tells me you're looking for something I took from Johnathan Gilbert.
I'm listening.
what is that?
Johnathan was passionate about his inventions.
he confided in me that he had created a detection device meant to track down the town's vampire element.
it was a pocket watch.
that's what it turned out to be, yes.
but that's not what I stole.
I discovered my mistake when I saw the watch in Johnathan's hand the night they took us.
its dial pointed at me.
so what is this? - I have no idea.
but now it's yours.
what's the catch?
there's no catch.
my daughter wants to stay here.
I want to stay here.
you refuse to trust us, and for good reason.
consider this an apology.
you shouldn't be here.
I know.
now you know.
that wasn't you.
Oh, it was absolutely me.
I'm a monster predator. It's who I am, Elena.
that's what the blood makes you.
the blood brings out what's inside of me. The blood brings out what's inside of me.
and if you think any differently, then you're an idiot.
I know this isn't you, Stefan.
I wanted to drain.
every ounce of blood from that girl's body.
no. - It's who I am, Elena.
no. You can't scare me off.
why would you risk it? Why would you come here?
because I did this.
this is my fault.
I'm the one who made you drink the blood.
all you did was expose me to who I really am.
this isn't you. - Stop saying that!
don't get any closer to me.
I'm not going to let this happen to you. - Stop.
Stefan, I'm not going to give up on you.
stop!
stop!
I'm so sorry.
it's ok.
it's ok.
I don't know what's happening to me.
it's ok, Stefan, shhh.
it's ok.
it's ok.
you're gonna be ok.
sure you want to do this?
I'm sure.
there's no guarantee this is going to work.
it has to.
you comin'?
for over a century, I have lived in secret until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
as a founding family member, I find it's my duty to report some very distressing news.
he's a Gilbert?
Elena's uncle.
mayor Lockwood, is it?
my name is Pearl. - hi.
this is my daughter Anna.
maybe there is such a thing as vampires.
they're just different from the way we always thought they were.
you got a problem with blood, Anna?
the coroner's office has officially ruled Vicki Donovan's death a drug overdose.
I don't think it was an overdose. - Jer, just let it go, ok?
is there something you're not telling me?
take my wrist, you need more blood.
I have this hunger inside of me that I've never felt before in my entire life.
I don't want you to see me like this.
I don't want you to know that this side of me exists.
nice car.
I thought it was a waste to leave it sitting in the garage.
I didn't know you were coming back today.
you know, I woke up this morning and I was feeling great, and I figured it was time for me to get back into things.
does this mean you're ok now?
with all the cravings? - Yeah.
I mean, the worst part is over.
so...
now all I want to do is just spend as much time with you as possible.
I'm ok with that.
Hey,thank you for helping me get through the The rough patch.
you're welcome.
we're going to be late.
OK, um, you know what, I'll catch up with you. I'm gonna grab my stuff.
I'll be right behind you.
OK. - ok.
there was a disturbance at the hospital blood bank last night.
some of the supply was compromised.
"Compromised? You mean stolen."
we almost missed it.
the inventory records were altered, but when the night manager was questioned, he had no recollection of changing them.
meaning the vampire who stole the blood used mind control to hide the theft.
I know what she meant. - We wouldn't have noticed if john not alerted us to recent discrepancies at other hospital blood banks in the county.
how lucky for us, we have john.
we're stepping up security at the hospital, giving the guards vervain to prevent this from happening again.
sheriff, might I offer a suggestion?
why don't let Damon and I put our heads together?
we can track down whoever's done this.
truthfully, I could use the extra hands.
is that something you'd be willing to do?
well, of course, I mean, if it'll help.
I think we'll make a good team.
don't you, Damon?
John, whatever I can do to help keep this town safe, even if it means spending time with you.
OK.
this week we're going to set aside our regular curriculum for a lesson in local history as we approach founder's day.
apparently the community leaders feel that's more important than world warⅡ, but hey, what do I know?
sorry I'm late.
looks like we will be at full occupancy today. Welcome home, Bonnie.
right, founder's day.
what does it mean to have a founder's day?
well, if you'll turn your attention to this exquisite diorama over here that I spent all night...
I suppose I should be grateful you learned how to use the bell.
I'm here on behalf of my mother.
on behalf of or in spite of?
I'm sorry about what the other vampires did to Stefan.
abducting him, torturing him.
it wasn't supposed to go down like that.
you were playing house with half of a tomb of really pissed off vampires.
what did you think was going to happen? - My mom is devastated.
they tried to overthrow her.
why isn't she here telling me this?
she doesn't really do apologies.
well, that's a coincidence, cause I don't do forgiveness, so just run along.
and if you're going to continue playing house with your little vampire pets, you might want to stop robbing the blood bank dry, because they're onto it.
I haven't been to the local blood bank in at least a week.
then it's one of your others. - The other ones are gone, Damon.
well, where'd they go?
they weren't cut out for this town.
after what happened with your brother, my mom kicked them out and they took off.
it's just us and Harper now.
Hey, I, um, I tried to grab you after class but you'd already taken off.
how are you?
how's your family? - We're dealing. It's been hard.
everyone here really missed you. - Yeah,
I just had so much to deal with after grams' funeral, and honestly after you told me that the tomb's spell failed, I just didn't really want to come back.
I hope you understand why I called.
I wanted you to know before you came home.
Yeah, I understand why. I just wish I didn't know.
I know it's been really hard...
thank god you're home!
I know we talked every day, but I missed you!
how are you doing?
better. Just better. You know, just glad to be back, and try to keep myself busy.
well, I can help with that.
major wardrobe confab needed asap.
you need to help me pick the perfect dress for the founder's court.
the founder's court? Did I miss something?
the founder's court.
you know, miss mystic falls.
they announced it today, and, um, you and are both on it.
Oh, my god, we signed up for that so long ago.
I completely forgot. - Yeah.
so are you dropping out, then?
I can't.
no?
her mom is the one who wanted her to enter.
how was school?
fine.
yeah?
same old, same old?
nothing new?
no stories to bring home?
you're making small talk, why?
you seem awfully chipper lately. Less doom and gloom, a little more pep in your step.
and you think it's because I drank human blood again.
I mean, I don't want to brag, but I would definitely take responsibility for this new and improved you.
right, right. Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but I'm clean.
Yeah, not possible.
not only is it possible, but it is quite true.
Stefan, let's be serious for a second.
you spent the last century and a half being a poster child for prozac, and now you expect me to believe that this new you has nothing to do with human blood, nothing.
I'm clean.
you're lying!
believe what you want.
I'm sorry for the short notice.
I didn't even know that the contest was coming up, much less that I would be in it.
well, I'll be happy to escort you anywhere.
my mom was really into this founder's day stuff.
she was even miss mystic in her day.
I kinda wanted to do it for her.
well, it'll be great. We'll have fun.
OK.
I'll see tomorrow. I love you.
love you, too.
well, well.
he's a liar and a thief.
So...When were you going to share?
go ahead.
help yourself. - No,no. I'm talking about the fact that you're a closet blood nknk.
so I'm drinking blood again.
you're the one that shoved it on me. What's your problem?
I have it under control.
under control?
you robbed the hospital.
so what's your point?
fine.
whatever, man. Drink up.
just remember we're trying to keep a low profile.
why don't you just walk up to sheriff forbes and ask her to tap a vein.
have my actions negatively impacted you?
I can't imagine what that must feel like.
Yeah, what's Elena think about the new...You?
Noing's changed. I'm still the same person.
clearly. - Elena doesn't need to know anything yet.
you've been off the human stuff for years, Stefan.
if you're having trouble controlling... - I'm not having any trouble.
who do you think you're talking to?
I know what it's like.
that jekyll and hyde feeling.
there's that switch, sometimes it goes off and you snap.
right now is not a good time for me to be worried about you snapping.
I know that it pains you to see this.
but I'm fine, ok?
I'm fine.
so please, do me a favor.
and back off.
this year's queen will have the special honor of taking center stage at the 150th founder's day gala.
before we crown our winner, we'd like to get to know a bit more about each of you.
I'm on the m. f.Beautification committee.
I volunteer at the rec center soup kitchen. - I recognize that
I haven't been as involved this year as I used to be.
I implemented this year's go green campaign at school.
I've been distracted, and I let a lot of things slide.
I don't think it's wrong for me to win 2 years in a row.
I was surprised to have been selected.
since I'm not from one of the founding families. - But I'm aware of what an honor this is, and I want you to know that I take it seriously.
worked with the county's recycling program and was in charge of the policemen's yearly raffle.
just because my drunken driving made my community service mandatory, - doesn't mean I was any less committed. - This was really important to my mother.
she believed in community, family, honor and loyalty.
it's the legacy she left for me.
Hey, partner. - What do you want?
you haven't returned any of my calls.
most people take that as a hint.
why don't we start looking for vampires?
why the act, john? I mean, you obviously don't care about catching vampires.
you're here talking to me.
actually, I care very much.
what did Isobel say about that? I mean, considering that she is one.
Isobel and I share a mutual interest.
the original Johnathan Gilbert had an invention that was stolen by a vampire.
that vampire was then burned alive in fell's church, or johnathan thought so.
and the invention was lost forever.
but then the vampires weren't killed, were they?
they were trapped.
and now they're free, thanks to you, which means the invention is retrievable.
well, what is it?
the only thing that Matters is that I want it back, and you're going to help me if you want your secret safe.
I mean, why bring me into it, john?
I mean, I don't even know what you're talking about, much less who has it.
Oh, come on, Damon.
you were around back then.
you know who these people are and what they look like.
he was friendly with a woman who turned out to be a vampire.
her name was Pearl.
does that ring a bell?
I'm not playing anymore.
get out. Get out.
I beg your pardon? - You know,
I only entertain this whole blackmail scheme thing of yours because I thought that you and Isobel could lead me to Katherine.
but see, now I know you have no idea where Katherine is, because if you did, you would know that Katherine and Pearl were best friends.
see, you don't know everything, do you, john?
I'll tell the entire council what you are. - Go for it.
I'll kill every last one of them.
then I'll sever your hand, pull your ring off, and I'll kill you, too.
do you understand that?
honor your partner.
let's focus.
right hand around.
flirt with your eyes.
left hand around.
this is ridiculous. - Both hands.
you're only saying that because you don't know how to do it.
sorry only one of us was around when the dance was invented.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
there's no touching during this part.
it's about the simple intimacy of the near-touch.
very nice, Amber.
thank you, mrs. Lockwood!
if you ask me, the near touch is overrated.
you seem to be in a good mood.
is that a bad thing?
would you prefer me to be brooding and tortured?
Hey, I'm not complaining.
Oh, no touching.
the Fell cousins don't have a shot.
and Amber Bradley is only on the court so the pageant doesn't look like it's founding families only, which, of course, it is.
so that leaves Elena.
she totally has the sympathy vote since her parents died.
how can I compete with that?
very nice.
very sensitive. - Oh, I'm sorry.
this must sound really unimportant in light of everything.
it's ok. I get it.
you want to win.
well, my grandmother was miss mystic.
and both of my aunts.
my mom's the only one who didn't get the gene, and I want this.
I mean, I actually deserve this.
Hey.
Hey. How are you?
I begged Bonnie to fill in for Matt.
he had to work today.
Bonnie, do you have a minute?
we only have 30 minutes for rehearsal. - It'll only take a minute. Please?
Bonnie, you have to tell me what's wrong.
it's not worth talking about.
what do you mean, not worth it?
you've barely said 10 words to me, and you won't even look at Stefan.
is that what it is, is it Stefan?
listen.
Elena, I can't just pretend like everything is ok.
everything my grandma did was to protect us from those vampires in the tomb.
and now they're out, which means she died for nothing.
I'm so sorry, Bonnie.
what can I do to make it better?
that's just it.
there's nothing you can do.
I blame him, Elena.
him and Damon.
and I'm not going to put you in a situation where you have to choose sides.
I'm just having a hard time with it. ok?
dude, are you ok?
you're bleeding.
are you ok? - Yes.
I'm sorry.
I was just....I was feeling a little sick.
I'll be fine.
I heard you're driving. - Yeah, I am.
let me get that for you.
Thanks. - Yeah.
um, how, uh... how is Stefan?
what do you mean?
you know, he seems on edge.
he went through a lot, he was in bad shape for a while.
but he's bouncing back now.
Hey, buddy. What are you doing here?
well, I'm the chauffer.
Oh, I thought I was driving.
Oh, no need. We're going with Rick.
are we ready?
Jeremy can ride with you.
in the running for miss mystic falls?
sometimes you have to wear uncomfortable heels to blend in.
I remember this event from 1864.
I was supposed to enter, before everything happened.
ahh, nostalgia's a bitch.
if you're just going to mock me, then you move along, please.
John Gilbert thinks your mom stole an artifact from Johnathan sr. Sr. back in 1864.
what are you, his errand boy?
I don't know what it is, but I don't want him to have it.
I could ask her.
but, you know, you've made it pretty clear that you don't trust us, so why should I even bother?
because you want to stay in mystic falls, and John Gilbert's in town, making that impossible.
find out where it is.
he leaves, you can buy a welcome mat.
thanks for helping me.
don't thank me until you're sure your hair isn't going to burn off.
you know, I remember when my mom and I were first applying for this.
she was so excited.
so were you, if I recall.
I was.
she just made it sound like so much fun.
lots has changed since then.
well, I hate to break it to you, but it's a little late for cold feet.
I don't have cold feet. I just...I think I'd be enjoying it a lot more if she was here.
I'll tell you one thing, your hair would have a better chance if she was.
OK, I should go put my dress on.
be careful with that thing.
don't hurt anybody.
you look miserable.
are there really a whole month of these events that I'm supposed to show up at?
you can fight it if you want, but it's a part of being a Gilbert.
Yeah, you, uh, you mentioned you know a lot about the family.
do you know anything about our ancestor Johnathan Gilbert?
prolific writer, crazy inventor.
why do you ask?
well, I read his journal.
is that right?
Yeah. I actually found it in all dad's stuff.
well, that's surprising.
most of them are locked away.
there's more of them? - Johnathan Gilbert journaled his whole life right down to the bitter, insane drunken end.
that guy had a lot of demons.
and did you read 'em?
I browsed, yeah.
What'd you think about what he wrote?
crazy ramblings of a mad man, of course.
Yeah.
well, she's very pretty.
Yeah, yeah, she's a, uh, a friend of mine.
excuse me.
are you ok, Amber?
I hate being the center of attention.
I get panic attacks.
do you need some privacy so you can change?
actually, I'm just...I'm just going to get some air.
Hey.
you can't be back here.
we need to talk.
does it have to be right now?
normally I would have a completely different outlook on what I'm about to tell you, but since it could really inconvenience me, i'll squeal.
what are you talking about?
Stefan's still drinking human blood.
what? - Yeah.
a month ago, I would have rejoiced.
but with the council back on the alert, it is not a good time for Stefan to fly off the handle.
I know he's been a little edgy, but he said that was normal.
he has a fridge full of stolen blood bank contraband in the house.
Oh, my god.
he has no idea what normal is.
his entire existence isn't normal.
normal to a vampire is drinking human blood.
but he spent all this time fighting it when he should have been learning how to ctrtrol it.
and now it's controlling him instead.
I can't believe this. I mean, it's Stefan that we're talking about here.
Stefan on human blood, Elena.
he'll do anything, he'll say anything, because he's not going to want to stop.
trust me.
what is it?
come on, don't be like that.
why not?
you're basically using me to turn you into a vampire so you could be with someone else.
no, I wasn't using you.
Really?
then how would you like to define it?
look, I don't think it's any worse than becoming friends with me so you could give your mother my blood.
how do you know that?
that's not important.
seriously, Jeremy.
what do you know?
everything.
I know everything.
this is all my fault. I'm the one who fed him the blood in the first place.
what's going on in here?
just filling Elena in on your extracurricular activities.
what are you talking about?
I know about the blood, Stefan.
I'm gonna.I'll be downstairs, drinking.
I was going to tell you.
when?
I'm fine.
I'm fine. The blood, it doesn't change anything.
it's changing you.
why, because I kept it a secret from you?
come on, Elena.
look, given the way that you're reacting right now, can you really blame me for doing that?
are you hearing yourself right now?
you've been stealing blood and lying, and you say that everything's fine?
everything's not fine, Stefan.
so what, so you and Damon all of a sudden have everythgg figured out then?
it's not about Damon.
it's about what's happening to you.
I know, and I'm telling you that I'm fine.
I'm fine.
please, come on.
Elena, I thought you...I thought you believed in me.
Elena? Let's go. The line up's starting.
I just...I need a minute.
you're not even dressed yet.
escorts wait downstairs, Stefan.
God!
Oh, god, sorry!
ms. Tina Fell, escorted by Bartholomew Whitmore.
has anyone seen Amber?
do you see Stefan down there?
Nope. Just my boring fill-in escort.
what happened to Matt?
they wouldn't let him out of work.
Hey, what happened to Stefan?
I don't know. He just disappeared somewhere. I don't know.
what am I doing?
I never should have gone through with this.
what do you mean?
I need to find Stefan. This isn't me. I'm not this person any more.
uh, no, no, no, no way, no.
you had your chance to drop out.
and believe me, I was all for it.
because there is no way that I can beat you.
Elena, you're doing this because it was important to your mom.
ms. Caroline Forbes, and her escort Jeffrey Lockwood Hmilton.
Elena, you're next. Come on.
you're missing Elena's introduction.
I don't care.
so she has no idea you read her journal?
she keeps things from me, I'm going to keep things from her.
what are you going to do now?
now that you know everything that she's been hiding from you?
I don't know.
there's a part of me that's so angry, you know, that she covered up what happened to vickie and erased my memory, but there's this other part of me that's glad.
I...I don't want to remember vickie like that.
as a monster?
no, as someone who wanted to hurt me.
when I met you, you were just a part of my plan to get my mother back.
but then things changed.
all the time we spent together, I would never do anything to hurt you.
not now.
you know that, right?
Yeah, I know that.
where are we going? - I don't know.
I'm in the ceremony.
not now, you're not.
you're standing in the parking lot with me.
I'm in the parking lot with you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm not very good to be around right now. I'm a little bit on edge.
I've.I've been drinking the human stuff and it's really screwing with my head.
she knows now.
God, she wasn't supposed to find out. I didn't want her to find out, now everything's ruined.
you seem sad.
I'm not sad!
I'm freaking hungry!
ms. Elena Gilbert, escorted by mr. Stefan salvatore.
Where's Stefan? - I don't know.
what is she doing with Damon?
I have no idea.
what are we going to do? - Right now we just have to get through this.
I don't hurt people.
I don't do that. I'm the good, brother.
do you want to hurt me?
I want to kill you.
I want to rip into your skin, and I want to feed on your blood.
under your skin, pulsating, flowing.
your carotid artery, right there. If you puncture this just right, you can control the blood flow.
it takes practice, but it doesn't have to make a mess.
you don't have to waste any.
what's stopping you?
if I do this, if I give in, there's no going back.
then don't.
I just want one taste. That's all I need. Just one more taste, one taste?
Where's Amber? - I don't know.
before I crown the winner, I'd like to offer a personal thank you to all of these young ladies for their efforts to better our communities.
so, without further adieu, it is my honor to announce our very "own miss mystic falls," ms. Caroline Forbes!
Congratulations!
I actually won!
there is blood on the glass.
get me Damon salvatore.
I can't do this!
what's the Matter? - I can't do this.
it's OK.
it doesn't hurt that much.
just not so hard next time.
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god.
I can't stop.
I can't stop.
why aren't you afraid of me, huh?
you told me not to be.
what?
what's your name?
listen to me, Amber.
I need you to be afraid of me.
I need you to run like hell, do you understand me?
run, run, now!
what is it, did you find him?
there were signs of struggle in the upstairs bathroom.
there was blood.
and that Amber girl is missing.
Oh, my god. He wouldn't hurt her.
he won't. - Let's just find him, OK?
let's get your coat, come on.
you said to run!
I changed my mind.
come on. Get control of it. Come on.
it's OK.
come on.
breathe through it, man.
Stefan, stop it!
it's OK.
she doesn't remember what happened.
it's a good thing the girls got here when they did. She lost a lot of blood.
you didn't see anything?
no. We just found her and then called Damon.
she gonna be ok?
looks like it, yeah.
why don't you girls get back to the party.
Damon and I can take it from here. - Yeah.
OK.
they didn't see the bite mark?
no, I got here before they got too close.
there was too much blood, they couldn't see it clearly.
Bonnie, can we talk about this?
there's nothing to talk about.
Bonnie, please.
I told you I wasn't going to make you choose, but I need to make the choice for myself.
please just leave me alone.
Jer. You ready?
uh, just a second.
who's that girl with Jeremy?
his friend Anna.
what's her story? - Why so nosy?
I'm just curious. He really seems to like her.
she's new in town, I think.
she and her mom, Pearl, the family you're so rudely trying to prevent from buying grayson's building.
her mother's name is Pearl?
Yes, so?
well, I believe I already know all about her.
Oh, good, there you are. Jenna wanted me to get the car.
what happened?
all right, now this is getting weird.
we're here to talk.
I'm not in the mood. Today's been a no-good, very bad day.
Annabelle tells me you're looking for something I took from Johnathan Gilbert.
I'm listening.
what is that?
Johnathan was passionate about his inventions.
he confided in me that he had created a detection device meant to track down the town's vampire element.
it was a pocket watch.
that's what it turned out to be, yes.
but that's not what I stole.
I discovered my mistake when I saw the watch in johnathan's hand, the night they took us.
its dial pointed at me.
so what is this? - I have no idea.
but now it's yours.
what's the catch?
there's no catch.
my daughter wants to stay here.
I want to stay here.
you refuse to trust us, and for good reason.
consider this an apology.
you shouldn't be here.
I know.
now you know.
that wasn't you.
Oh, it was absolutely me.
I am a monster predator. It's who I am, Elena.
that's what the blood makes you.
the blood brings out what's inside of me. The blood brings out what's inside of me.
and if you think any differently, then you're an idiot.
I know this isn't you, Stefan.
I wanted to drain every ounce of blood from that girl's body.
no. - It's who I am, Elena.
no. You can't scare me off.
why would you risk it? Why would you come here?
because I did this.
this is my fault.
I'm the one who made you drink the blood.
all you did was exposing me to who I really am.
this isn't you. - Stop saying that!
don't get any closer to me.
I'm not going to let this happen to you. - Stop.
Stefan, I'm not going to give up on you. I believe you.
stop!
stop!
I'm so sorry.
it's ok.
it's ok.
I don't know what's happening to me.
it's ok, Stefan, shhh.
it's OK.
it's OK.
you're gonna be ok.
sure you want to do this?
I'm sure.
there's no guarantee this is going to work.
it has to.
you coming?
for over a century, I have lived in secret unitil now.
I know the risk. But I have to know her.
the original Johnathan Gilbert had an invention that was stolen by a vampire.
her name was Pearl. - I gave your device to Damon.
why don't you ask him for it yourself?
mom! Mama!
my wife Isobel spent her life researching paranormal activities in this area.
what have you done to my wife? - I turned her.
why do I look like her? - You were adopted.
this girl showed up, 16 and about to give birth.
what else do you know about her? - Just her name--Isobel.
stop looking. She doesn't want to know you.
she's alive?
does that mean she's a...
Hello, Rick.
it's good to see you. You look good.
I hear that you're a high-school history teacher?
how--how is that?
where have you been, Isobel?
I don't have any reasons that are gonna comfort you.
I don't have any explanations that are gonna satisfy you.
I wanted this.
it's that simple? - Yeah.
you were supposed to mourn me and move on.
you were my wife.
and I loved you.
how could I not search for you?
because I wasn't lost, Rick.
I understand that you know my daughter Elena.
and I hear that she's been looking for me. So I want you to arrange for a meeting with us.
you want me to deliver a message?
Yeah.
screw you.
you selfish bitch.
what do you want from me?
I told you. - I'm not gonna do anything for you.
you better tell Elena that I want to meet her,
or I'm gonna start killing the citizens of this town one by one,
and I'm gonna start with your history students.
got it?
I'm supposed to help build the miss mystic float for the Founder's day parade.
if I don't, I get the wrath of Caroline.
but I wanted to check in first.
well, I'm doing great. Thanks for asking.
I'm checking on Stefan. - Oh, him?
he's--he's terrible.
what's the Matter?
he's just back to boring, straitlaced, off the junk.
you've successfully cured him of anything that was interesting about his personality.
don't forget who helped me. - I hate myself.
Hey, did uncle John mention anything to you about my field trip with the history teacher?
no, I've still been avoiding him.
Why? What's he up to?
I don't know. But i'd love it if you could find out for me.
I gotta go. I'm late.
have fun with the mystic queen. I know I did.
Elena called.
these are the specs for the history department's Founder's day float.
we're gonna be recreating the battle of willow creek.
Tyler's been nominated head of the production design.
by who? - By me.
I've seen your sketches, and they're good.
look, I'm not really into the whole
Yeah, well, you just pick your team, be creative, and don't screw up.
great.
you want to help me out with this?
not really, no.
Hey, mr. Saltzman. - Come with me.
we need to talk.
let's reference last year's miss mystic float.
this is what they did last year.
and it's exactly what we don't want to do.
EW. - Yeah.
OK. So, what are we doing?
southern classic elegance. - "Gone with the wind"?
how do you know? - You channel Scarlett daily.
so true. - Yeah.
Where's Elena? She's supposed to be helping.
I don't know.
OK, what's the deal?
what do you mean? - Don't play dumb.
you and Elena are fighting. Spill.
it's nothing. - It's not nothing.
you know, this whole float Is supposed to be about friends creating something together,
and everyone is fighting.
Matt and Tyler hate each other.
you and Elena are on the outs.
I--I don't like it.
and I can't fix it if I don't know what's wrong.
I can't talk about it, Caroline. I'm sorry.
thanks for coming. - Sorry I'm late.
the dog ate my, uh...
never mind.
what's all the furrowed brows? - I saw Isobel last night.
Isobel's here?
in town?
you're late. - I didn't realize there was a schedule.
what's with the side show?
Cherie is a little jazz singer that I picked up in a blues bar in Brooklyn.
and I got the cowboy at a gay rodeo in Amarillo.
he's gay? - Not right now.
he's very good to me.
I'm teaching them french.
I can smell the judgment coming of you.
well, they're people, Isobel, and you're treating them Like they're dolls.
if we're gonna be partners, You really have to stop being such a hater.
we're in a partnership together because we share a mutual goal.
don't ever confuse that for an acceptance of your lifestyle.
my lifestyle?
so, I assume that you still don't have the invention.
I'll get it. I said I would.
uh, you threatened to expose Damon Katherine. That didn't work.
you killed that Pearl lady. Still no invention.
I really don't think that your plan is working, John.
well, you being here isn't going to help anything.
you failed, John.
I'm gonna take it from here.
did you ask about uncle John?
are they working together? - No.
no, they're not? - No, I didn't ask.
what about the invention? - Didn't ask.
does she know about the tomb of vampires? - I don't know.
did words completely escape you?
no, I was a little too distracted by my dead vampire wife to ask any questions.
what did she want? - She wants to see me, Damon.
Alaric is supposed to arrange a meeting.
we don't know why or what she wants.
you don't have to see her if you don't want to.
I don't really have a choice.
she's threatened to go on a killing spree.
I take it that's not ok with you guys.
I want to do it.
I want to meet her.
if I don't, I know I'll regret it.
can you hear me?
thanks for coming.
I'm nervous.
but i'm happy that you're here.
love you.
Hello, Elena.
you look just like her.
it's eerie.
you've met Katherine? - She found me after I turned.
genetic curiosity, I suppose.
she would be fascinated by you.
is that how you can walk in the day?
Katherine helped me obtain it.
who's my father? - Not important.
he was a teenage waste of space. - A name would be nice.
it would, wouldn't it? You ask a lot of questions.
why did you compel that man to kill himself？
right after he told me to stop looking for you?
traumatic impact.
wish it would have been more effective.
human life means that little to you?
means nothing to me.
it's just part of being what I am.
no. It's not.
I know other vampires. That's not true.
your boyfriend is over there by the pool table? Stefan Katherine?
why Stefan? Why didn't you go for Damon?
or do enjoy them both?
like Katherine did?
we should be in there. - No.
Isobel made it clear We're not to step foot inside.
I'm not gonna kill her in a crowded restaurant.
you're not gonna kill her, period.
she ruined your life, and you still want to protect her?
she's my wife, was-- was my wife.
I looked for the woman I married, but she wasn't there.
whoever that is cold and detached. - Yeah.
she's given up her humanity. - Yeah, see, I don't get that.
Stefan has his humanity. He's a good guy.
Oh, you're a dick and you kill people, but I still see something human in you.
but with her, there was nothing.
you can turn it off...
like a button you can press. I mean, Stefan's different.
he wants the whole human experience.
he wants to feel every episode of "how I met your mother, so he shuts his feelings out.
the problem is, as a vampire, your instinct is not to feel.
Isobel chose the easier road-- No guilt and shame, no regret. I mean, come on.
if you could turn it off, wouldn't you?
you haven't. - Of course I have, Rick.
that's why I'm so fun to be around.
why did you want to meet me?
it can't be to just catch up.
because I'm curious about you.
but the real reason is I want what your uncle wants.
Johnathan Gilbert's invention.
how do you know my uncle?
I used to spend a lot of time here when I was younger.
John had a crush on me for years.
he was the first one that told me about vampires.
so, what made you want to be one?
it's a very long list of reasons, Elena, all of which I'm sure you've thought about.
that was your first lie.
it's inevitable. You're gonna get old.
Stefan won't.
forever doesn't last very long When you're human.
I'm sorry, But I don't have what you're looking for.
sit down. And tell your boyfriend to walk away.
I want the invention. - I don't have it.
I know that. But Damon does.
and you're gonna get it for me.
he's not gonna give it to me.
then the blood will be on your hands.
it is nice meeting you, Elena.
Hey, Anna. Uh, where are you?
what's up? Uh...
give me a call when you get this.
how is Anna?
I like that girl.
she has fire.
uh, I don't know.
she won't return my calls.
girl trouble?
no, no trouble. Anna just owes me a call. That's it.
is it the girl that I saw you with at the founder's pageant?
you two are getting pretty hot and heavy, huh?
when was the last time you saw her?
Why? - I'm just making conversation.
no one else in this house likes me.
at least I can talk to you, especially if you need someone to talk to about girls.
please.
so, seriously, how well do you know Anna?
I know Anna extremely well.
well, know that you can talk with me about anything.
I'm here to answer any questions that you have.
I'll help you in any way I can.
Why?
cause your dad would want me to.
I'm, uh, I am good.
Uh-oh, Cherie.
you won again.
hope i'm wearing my good underwear.
it's just on blast from the past after another.
no, no, no.
it's good to see you, Isobel.
I was just having fun with your naughty little minion.
how'd you find me?
searched all the neighborhood bank-owned foreclosures
and found this is the most expensive one.
Oh, I should have known.
you were the one who taught me that.
what are you really doing here?
well, you caused quite a stir when you blew into town.
so, everyone except for me, you would have hurt.
I'm so sorry.
did you bring the device?
what are you doing with John Gilbert?
we dated a few times when we were young.
he was a little bit in love with me.
I'm sure one of the many.
you know this little invention, what do you want with it?
Oh, me personally?
I don't want anything with it.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
you know, Damon, we're on the same side.
Oh, yeah? Which side is that?
Katherine's.
she wants John Gilbert to have the device.
and I think that you know that she's not happy When she doesn't get what she wants.
why are you doing her dirty work?
don't kill the messenger.
we both know that you can't control Katherine.
she does what she wants.
so do I. - Oh, really, Damon?
you do?
what should we do now?
Oh, yeah. Resurface.
now that I have your attention, listen up.
you do not come into my town, threaten people I care about.
going after Elena-- Bad move.
you leave her alone, or I will rip you to bits, because I do believe in killing the messenger.
you know why?
because it sends a message.
if Katherine wants something from me, You tell that little bitch to come get it herself.
Hi.
Hey.
I couldn't sleep last night.
you were obviously upset about something, And I just walked away.
that's not me.
that can't be us.
you're my friend, Elena.
if you need me, I'm here for you.
and I'm sorry I couldn't show you that yesterday.
I met my birth mother.
was it...
are you ok?
Hey, man.
yeah?
so, Caroline tells me you've been on your own the past 2 weeks.
is everything ok?
you're asking me about my mom. Seriously?
look, man, why don't I just have her give you a call when she walks back through town?
dude...
that's not what I meant.
OK? I'm just trying to...
I don't know what to say. - Well, good, man.
don't say anything, because you're a dick. End of story.
I know...
whatever.
thanks for meeting me.
I wanted you to see this.
is that Emily's spell book?
I've been going through it since grams died.
check this out.
that's the vampire compass.
Yeah. According to Emily, Johnathan Gilbert never actually succeeded in inventing anything.
Emily secretly spelled them all with magic
compass...
rings...
and the mystery device you told me about.
Yeah, that's it. Well, part of it.
Damon only has the one piece.
Emily pledged her loyalty to Katherine.
but she couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get killed.
this was the only way she could think of to help.
to let Johnathan Gilbert believe he'd actually invented these devices.
does it say what it does?
are you sure this is what Isobel wants?
Yeah, i'm sure. Why?
this is a weapon against vampires.
Hey. Um...
have you seen Stefan? I need to find him.
no, not lately. Listen.
um, you have a second?
uh, yeah. What's up? What's going on?
well, it's Anna.
I left her all these messages,
and she hasn't gotten back to me-- Not even a text.
I didn't know that you guys were still friends.
we're more than friends.
look, something could be seriously wrong.
and if you know anything, you gotta tell me.
I haven't talked to her, Jeremy.
are you lying to me right now?
why would you say that?
beause that's what you do, Elena. You lie.
you lie about everything.
I know what Anna is.
and I know that you know. So, tell me.
do you have any idea where she is?
no.
but jeremy... Jeremy. Wait.
what are you doing here?
I'm your mother, Elena.
I want to be more involved in your life.
I don't want you in my life.
I understand that. You already have a lot of people that you care about.
but I've been studying. Let's see if I got this right.
there is the witchy best friend Bonnie.
gonna stay away from that one.
Oh... Sad little brother jeremy.
and there's Caroline-- Obnoxious Caroline.
I got all of my info from her, by the way.
she had no idea who I was, and she wouldn't stop yapping.
there's Matt-- Friend, ex, yappy's future ex.
lots of connections there.
Matt's not involved with us. - He's involved with you. Isn't he?
look, you shouldn't be here.
you need to leave. - No.
I have some friends here, too. Look.
see that man over there standing next to Matt by the float?
his name's frank. He's very handsome.
and he's also very handy.
and he noticed that the axle was kind of rusted, Which is very dangerous.
so, all you have to do is apply a little bit of pressure, and
No!
Hey, get this trailer up!
come on, guys, lift it up, please! - Give me a hand!
come on, lift.
come on!
call for help. - OK.
why are you doing this?
I'm showing you how easy it is to hurt the people that you care about.
you're doing this just because of Johnathan Gilbert's invention?
hand it over and the fun will stop.
I told you, Damon's not gonna give it to me.
and I think that you underestimate how much Damon cares about you.
he'll kill you before he gives it up.
is that before or after I kill your brother jeremy?
the ambulance is saying 15-20 minutes.
I have my car. I can take him to the hospital.
Caroline can take me.
I didn't drive. - Then I'll wait. It's fine.
you will not wait!
OK, you need to see a doctor right now. Tyler's driving. End of story.
go!
I'll bring my car around.
I see you're packing. That's a good sign.
won't be long now.
did you get the missing piece? Where is it?
I don't have it yet.
then why did you call me here?
beause I have the next best thing.
what the hell are you doing?
getting what I want.
Yeah, but he's my nephew.
and you're gonna let him go right this second.
the gaudy ring on your finger-- It comes off.
come on. Come on, Isobel. I know you.
OK? It's me, John.
you can't hurt a kid.
I'll kill him to prove you wrong. - Really?
are you that far gone?
look, I know you've changed.
but the old Isobel is in there somewhere still. Isn't she?
come on. Let him go.
nice try.
we'll see how you do without this.
Where's the device?
Damon has it.
he's gonna be difficult to reason with.
then we'll go him. I'll talk to him.
he's not just gonna hand it over, especially if it's harmful to vampires.
what if it's not?
absolutely not. - Just hear me out.
I'm not gonna give the device to Isobel, so she can give it to John who's gonna turn around and kill me.
I like being a living dead person.
but it'll be useless. Bonnie can take its power away.
I don't trust her.
I can remove the original spell.
John and Isobel will never know. - No.
no, I'll get jeremy my own way.
Really? How are you gonna do that?
because Isobel is a vampire, and jeremy can be dead the second you walk in the door.
are you even up for this?
I mean, no offense. You're no Emily bennett.
Emily knew what she was doing. - I've been practicing.
it's not piano lessons, honey.
what's your favorite book?
what? - Name a book, Any book.
name a book.
how about...
"call of the wild," Jack london?
Jack london. Great parlor tRick.
we're doing this, Damon.
and we're gonna do it my way.
now, give me the device.
we're wasting time.
I don't trust you. I tried to kill you.
you're right. You can't trust me.
but you can trust me.
thank you.
here you go. - Thank you.
what is she after?
your ancestor invented a weapon
a device that's extremely harmful to vampires.
we've been trying to get it. - Why?
beause there's a group of vampires from a long time ago that wants revenge on this town.
but why would a vampire help you kill other vampires?
she has her own reasons for wanting them dead.
look, jeremy, No one ever thought vampires would return to this town
not in modern times.
but they have.
and we have to destroy them.
all of them?
no, there are some good ones out there.
there's no such thing.
I don't believe that.
well, your dad did.
and as his son, that should mean something to you.
how did my father know about all this?
who do you think taught me about the family history?
done.
great. Now what?
now we give it to Isobel.
Where's the device?
Where's my brother?
this isn't a negotiation.
Where's the invention?
where is my brother?
do you really think that I came alone?
do you really think that I came alone?
for god sakes, call home.
what?
call home, ask to speak to your brother jeremy.
Hello?
Jeremy. Are you ok?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Uncle John, uh, hit his head.
it was an accident. And we're all laughing.
Yeah, but, um, I am ok.
I'll be home soon, all right?
Yeah.
you were never going to hurt him.
no. I was going to kill him.
don't look for any redeeming qualities in me.
I don't have any.
but you took a risk with Damon.
how did you know that he was going to give it to me?
because he's in love with you.
thank you.
for what?
for being such a monumental disappointment.
it keeps the memory of my real mother perfectly intact.
good-bye, Elena.
as long as you have a salvatore on each arm, you're doomed.
Katherine was smart.
she got out.
but we all know that you're not Katherine.
Hey, it's Anna. Leave a message.
Jeremy, we have to talk about this.
no, we really don't.
I don't know what Anna told you, but there are things that you need to know.
yeah? Because...
I'm pretty sure that your journal covered it.
you read my journal?
and save me the speech about invasion of privacy,
because I read a section about Damon erasing my memory, about what happened to Vicki.
Jeremy, please, you don't understand.
the night that vicki died, it was like mom and dad died all over again.
it was all over your face.
and it hurt so much to see you like that.
I just wanted to take away your pain, I'm so sorry.
just get out.
no, jeremy-- - Elena!
just get out. Please.
Jer, I...
what do you want?
I totally get it.
you here as a history teacher.
it's good. - What the hell are you doing?
you act like you don't care, And yet here you are hunting me down.
I'm leaving.
I just thought I'd say goodbye
well, you couldn't be bothered the first time, So why now?
you hate me, good.
does that make it easier for you?
I mean, what is the whole point of this exercise?
what did you expect?
you spent a lot of time to find me. What did you think you would find?
the woman who gave me this...
I mean, you act like you don't care.
but you cared enough to protect me after you left.
I was a different person back then.
right, right, right. And that person is gone.
the woman I married, the woman I loved, she's just gone.
you expect me to believe that?
what are you doing?
well, i'm ring-Free.
I'm vervain-Free, so either kill me or compel me, Because...
I don't believe it.
not for a second.
I wanted this.
I needed this.
and I'm going to regret it forever.
this was my mistake.
not yours.
you are not going to remember this.
I loved you.
but your heart's free of me.
it's better this way.
good-bye, Rick.
Anna? Hey, what are you doing here?
my mother.
she's dead.
what?
she was killed.
Oh, my god, Anna...
Hey. Hey, I'm so sorry.
I know I'm not supposed to be here, But I don't have anywhere else to go.
Hey, it's ok.
would you like one?
say it. Whatever it is, purge, get it out.
it's about what Isobel said. - What about it?
well, I know that you and Elena bonded,
and I know that she cares about you, and, uh,
I know you care about her.
well, this is going in an interesting direction.
I'm just concerned about Elena being hurt.
she considers you a friend.
same here. Elena's a very good friend.
actually, she might qualify as my only friend.
is that a problem?
so, at the risk of sounding like a, um, - Like a jealous boyfriend-- - Oh, there's no risk. You do.
history will not be repeating itself where Elena's concerned.
do you understand what I'm saying?
sure.
do you understand?
Hey, whatever you say, man. I mean, honestly, we're just friends.
and as her friend, I wasn't looking forward to telling her the truth, anyway.
so, I'll let you do it.
what truth?
about John.
because I know you guys don't like to keep secrets from each other.
what are you talking about?
am I the only one around here Who has the ability to put two and two together?
Isobel. Hello?
she dated John when she was 15.
she gets pregnant, and ends up at the doctor's office of John's brother.
now, what do you think John's role is in all of this, huh?
I mean, go ahead, think about it. I'll wait.
you get it? You there yet?
so, you think that John Is Elena's father?
Ding ding ding!
what proof do you have?
I don't need any proof. I have the DNA tests for John and Elena.
but I know how well you deal with these big bombshells, so sleep tight.
Oh, and when you do tell Elena,
and she needs a friend to talk to about anything
I'm here for her.
Hello?
on your doorstep, You'll find what you've been looking for.
and my ring?
don't screw this up.
John.
I got it.
I won't fail.
you better not.
Katherine wants all of those tomb vampires dead.
and I want to add two more to that list.
let me guess. - Stefan and Damon.
I don't want this life for her.
well, it was always a part of the plan.
consider them gone.
she's our daughter, John.
we owe that to her.
I know.
so you're not going to tell me what happened?
I did something bad, Caroline.
and I lied about it.
to who?
I pretended to do something I didn't really do.
what are you talking about?
I couldn't do what she wanted me to do.
it wasn't right.
grams would have never done it, So I couldn't, either.
but when Elena finds out, she's never going to forgive me.
for over a century, I have lived in secret, Until now.
I know the risk, But I have to know her.
what are you? - I'm a vampire.
that noise. - What noise?
Yaah! Tyler!
what the hell?
I can give caroline some blood. - No. No way.
it's just enough to make her heal. - Do it.
so the black sheep returns. - Tyler.
who's the guy with caroline?
it's the mayor's younger brother, mason lockwood.
Damon, I care about you. I do, but I love stefan.
Elena, what's going on here?
no, damon! Damon-- No, no, no, no.
why do I look like katherine? - You are not katherine.
you are the opposite of everything that she was.
Elena, what are you doing here? - My name is katherine.
I was hoping you could Give the salvatore brothers a message for me.
game on. - What
I mean, katherine looked just like you. It was freakish.
she is my ancestor.
Hey, I moved the student booth into the cafeteria.
your vampire ancestor, And she didn't just resemble you Like a family member would.
she was you. - I don't --I don't know
I can't explain it. Ok? It's creepy. It's all I got.
well, how do you know she's not still out there pretending to be you?
I don't, but I could sit here And be tortured by the not knowing,
or I could get these prizes to the ringtoss.
well, have you talked to damon Since he killed jeremy or--or tried to kill jeremy?
no, bonnie, I haven't, And I won't, and I don't wanna talk about damon
or anything else that's vampire-related, ok?
copy that.
I'm human, And I have to do human stuff. Otherwise, I'm gonna go crazy.
OK. I'm sorry. Now focus.
we have to make caroline proud, Or she will kill us.
I don't know how she does this all the time.
well, because she's not human, obviously. - Obviously.
it's, uh--it's the same as the bracelet elena gave you.
so it protects me from compulsion. - Vervain is toxic to vampires.
you mean like poison? - Yeah. It's very poisonous.
it'll keep 'em out of your head. - I mean, why vervain?
I don't know. Certain natural herbs and roots and other elements Are just harmful to vampires.
like a stake to the heart? - Right, but it has to be wood.
you're pretty confident in yourself, Telling me all the different ways I could kill you.
Jeremy, if I thought you wanted to kill me, We'd be having a much different conversation, ok.
Yeah. Damon is the one that deserves it.
I want you to forget about damon, all right?
he's a hundred times stronger than you, And right now, he's not stable.
gotta try to move forward.
I was killed by a vampire and brought back by a magic ring.
how do you move forward from there? Right.
well, today we have a nice little distraction Courtesy of slave driver elena. Hello, elena.
Hey. Um, do you
Yeah, yeah, I set up the goldfish toss, all 300 goldfish.
he's gonna be all right. He's just been though a little bit of an ordeal.
I was just hoping that this carnival Would reel him back into the land Of high school teenager.
Oh, is that what we're doing here? - Yes. We all are.
we're gonna be boring high school students - Who live in a world where the "v" word is not uttered. - Got it.
and then later you're gonna take me To the ferris wheel, we're gonna ride to the very tops. Then you're gonna kiss me, and my heart will flutter Like a normal high school girl.
do you see a running theme here? Yeah.
no, I'm seeing it, I'm--I'm liking it, But I have a quick question.
um, what do we do about damon? Uh, no "d" word, ok?
that has been deleted from the list of topics that we can discuss.
unfortunately, katherine showing up Has him in a little bit of an odd place, Little off-kilter, kind of dangerous.
who knows what he's up to?
so I understand john gilbert has left town.
have they found the vampire that attacked him?
well, the sheriff has asked me to take the lead on that,
and I promise you I will get to the bottom of it.
which brings me to my next subject.
with richard gone, I'll be acting as interim mayor until the elections,
and I'm going to need someone to spearhead the council.
I'd like that person to be you.
whatever you need, carol.
I--as a founding family member, It's something that's very close to me,
so I would be honored to help Keep this town safe from vampires.
hoo, boy. Oh, jeez.
is it safe to talk?
it's my brother-in-law mason. He's still visiting.
I just don't want him to hear us.
he didn't want any part of the council when he lived here,
and I see no reason to bring him into it now.
what was that, like 7? - 6.
I don't count the last one.
you crawled it. - What.
think grandma lockwood actually passed you-- Heh heh-- in her walker.
Yeah. Ok. Shoes off. Mud, my mom... - Cool. Yeah, yeah.
so all this anger and aggression you're talkin' about,
do you notice a difference when you exercise?
dude, I play 3 varsity sports.
I work out 4 times a week and run 3. I'm gonna say no.
do you have episodes?
I mean, what happens, exactly? - Starts out normal.
you get angry, typically over nothing.
I'm an angry guy. You know, it just amplifies, and then I go off.
you black out? - Yeah.
it's like I go blind with rage.
is there a pattern?
like once a month? Only at night?
all I know is I lose myself. You know?
for that time...I become something else.
and I hate it. - More tea?
Damon? - Yes, please.
thank you, carol.
your mom said you're not eating.
that's gross. - It's hospital food. It's supposed to be gross.
she also said you're getting released tomorrow morning.
morning?
uh, I need to get out tonight. - No.
the carnival's gonna happen without you, caroline.
I--I know it's hard for your neurotic, control-freak personality to process, - But bonnie and elena have it. - I'm not neurotic.
Yeah, you are, but it's cute, so...
look, it's not about the carnival. Ok?
it's just that this place is just really depressing.
that's 'cause you're sitting in the dark. - No, don't!
what the hell? - Just close it, please.
what's wrong with you? - Close it.
OK.
I'll just come back later, ok?
would you care for one? - No.
thank you. I'm not hungry. Just ate.
aren't you worried that one day, All the forest animals Are gonna band together and fight back?
I mean, surely they talk.
I'm just happy that's a, uh
a blood bag and not a sorority girl supplying your dinner.
I like this, You walking on eggshells around me
because you think I'm goona edplode. It's very suspenseful.
is elena worried, too?
I bet I'm your every conversation. - Have you heard from katherine?
I think the lockwoods have a family secret,
beacuse the filbert device affected them. Vervain didn't, so they're not vampires.
they're something else. Is this your new obsession?
Oh, you'd rather some unknown supernatural element Running rampant in our town, fine.
I'll drop it.
we haven't seen the last of katherine. You do know that, right?
we have no idea what she's up to. - sure, we do.
she came back to profess her undying, eternal love for you,
so I'm gonna let you deal with her,'
cause I have more important things to do, Like explode.
Cheers.
that's pretty.
Yeah. My friend gave it to me.
what's wrong?
you can't tell anyone.
you can't tell anyone.
I can't tell anyone. - You'll do what I say?
I'll do what you say. - Good.
because I'm starving.
the ringtoss is out of bart and homer dolls and team jacob ts.
OK, I can grab some from the science club. Also, we lost a speaker in the karaoke booth.
Hey, it's all good, elena. Take a beat.
look around. This is a huge success.
you mean, I can do more than just wreak vampire havoc? - Eak Go figure.
Hey. Uh, carter, right?
you're with the carnival. - That'd be me.
OK. Great.
what you need, beautiful?
um, what do you know about karaoke speakers?
why don't you show me the problem. - Yeah, bonnie.
show him the problem.
OK. Come on. - Come on.
what are you doing?
nothin'. Just killin' time.
you lookin' for something? - Yeah, actually.
you know where I can find any family artifact stuff? The heirlooms?
you blow through your trust fund already? - I did that when I was 22.
I'm just lookin' for this old piece of my mom's.
my dad gave it to her when they got married.
has sentimental value.
probably passed down to your dad. Should still be in the house here somewhere.
what's it look like? - It's a moonstone.
it's about the size of a hockey puck,
old ugly minimal monetary value.
Hey, man. Whatever.
um, ask my mom, I guess. Yeah, cool. I'll do that.
you ready? - Yeah.
so good to see you alive.
aren't you a little old for a high school carnival?
about 150 years too old.
Oh, you're pretty funny cracking jokes when I could-- I don't know -
blow the whole lid off this thing By telling someone what you really are.
so please tell me that that is not a threat.
maybe it is.
this is what we're not gonna do.
we're not gonna walk around like we're invincible
when it's this easy for me to end you.
if you wanna tell people what I really am, Go ahead and try.
I will shove this ring so far up your ass,
you'll really have something to choke on.
the doctor said I'm good as new.
he signed me out, and he said I didn't have to wait till morning,
so call me when you get this.
it's dark, thank god.
I am so sorry about that.
OK, now, what's the story?
my husband likes to get kinky.
Yes. Good.
OK.
so... I'm gonna take off.
I'm the committee chair for the carnival,
and I'm worried it's a complete disaster.
I mean, god bless elena, But she does not understand the word "fabulous.
once again, I am so sorry about that,
and if you could just forget that I bit you,
that would be great, because I'm going to.
forget what?
I don't know how that works, But it's brilliant.
come on! You're lurking.
observing. More like obsessing.
he's got strength.
he's a triple-letter varsity athlete. Of course he has strength.
you're reaching.
I bet I can take you.
enter the uncle.
bring it on, surfer boy.
this is ridiculous.
is that it?
all right, he's the champ. Who wants to go next?
uh, stefan wants a go.
Thanks. Yeah, sure. I'll, uh-- I'll give it a shot.
go, stef.
get him, stef.
my brother over there thinks I can beat you.
your brother's wrong.
you didn't put in any effort at all.
Yeah, actually, I did.
come with me.
is he-- - No, no, no. It wasn't that kind of strength,
but it was more than human, if that makes any sense.
what is up with that family?
if they're not vampires, then what the hell are they?
uh, maybe they're, uh, ninja turtles.
you're not funny.
or, no, zombies. Werewolves.
no comedic timing at all.
what? What are you up to?
since this is reality and there's no such thing as werewolves
or combat turtles.
I said,"ninja turtle." - Hey, you.
I have a name. - Yeah, I don't care.
I need you to pick a fight with someone,
kid named tyler lockwood.
Damon, don't do this. - No, no. It's just an experiment.
get him mad.
don't back down, no matter what he does, ok?
I won't back down.
I know you won't.
you do realize somebody's gonna get hurt, right?
no, someone's gonna get mad, As in rage.
and what's that gonna accomplish?
that tyler kid from a fight.
let's see who intervenes.
maybe it's the ambiguously Supernatural mystery uncle.
Oh, hey, blondie.
they let you out.
I remember.
what do you remember?
I remember how you manipulated me...
you pushed me around, abused me,
erased my memories. Fed on me.
you're crazy.
well, the memories have been coming back In pieces.
you can't remember.
it's impossible.
I mean, unless you were becoming a...
I have a message from katherine.
she said,"game on.
you suck.
Elena. - What do you want, damon?
I know I'm the last person you wanna see right now,
but I need you to come with me.
whatever it is, I'm not interested.
Yeah, I need you to come with me right now, elena.
watch where you're goin'.
you got a problem?
Yeah. You walked right into me.
what are you gonna do about it?
you're kidding, right?
better back off.
you hit me again, I swear to god.
Hey! Tyler! Hey.
Tyler! Hey! Let go! Get back.
what the hell, man?
your eyes.
come on. Let's go.
you all right, man?
why did I just do that?
you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
what do you think? What are you doin' here?
they discharged me. All better.
uh, how do you feel? Are...
you know, I feel pretty good.
yeah? 'cause earlier, you were a little
I'm all better.
all better.
OK. Wanna give it a shot?
Yeah.
uh, hey, nice shot, killer.
uh, they must have already been broken.
Oh, no.
what's wrong?
I gotta go.
no, care, wait. Come here. Are you ok?
I mean, do you need to go back to the-- - Just leave me alone.
how did this happen?
well, I fed her blood, And katherine obviously killed her,
and "a" plus "b" equals...
but why?
because katherine is a manipulative, nasty little slut.
and she said,"game on"? I mean, what does that even mean?
it means she's playing dirty. She wants us to know.
but why caroline?
Ah, I don't know.
Caroline must be completely out of her mind.
she has no idea what's happening to her.
Oh, I think she does.
all of my compulsion from the past Started wearing off the minute she was in transition.
we have to find her. - Yep, and kill her.
you're not gonna kill caroline.
she knows who we are. She's officially a liability. We gotta get rid of her.
Damon, absolutely not.
need I remind you Of a tragic little story Of a girl named vicki donovan?
Yeah. Caroline, of all people, Will not make it as a vampire.
her mother's a vampire hunter.
guys, come on. We all know how this story ends,
so let's just flip to the last chapter and -
it's not an option, damon.
no?
your silence is deafening, stefan.
wait. Wasn't there a school carnival The night you staked vicki?
talk about a town where history repeats itself.
you know I'm right.
we're not gonna kill her.
it's the only way.
no.
Hey, is everything ok?
I'm so sorry.
what?
she's obviously pissed at me for something,
but for what, no clue.
what happened?
she freaked out, And she's been like that all day,
cool one minute and crazy and neurotic the next.
she almost died. It's bound to mess with her head.
Plus, she's caroline.
Yeah. I'm used to the insecurities and all that.
that's who she is, love it or hate it.
but this seemed-- I don't know
different, More.
I--I can't explain it.
you agree with damon, don't you?
Stefan. Hey.
Damon's right, not about what we should do,
but about what's gonna happen.
Katherine all but signed caroline's death sentence.
we can't let it end that way.
she's doing this to me, isn't she?
actually, she's doin' it to me.
all right, we're home.
safe territory. Enough with the silence.
told you to leave it alone.
what was that move you pulled?
brazilian martial arts. I took some classes a while back.
don't lie to me. - I'm not lyin'.
I saw something!
you didn't see anything.
I saw your eyes.
they glowed.
reflection of a car headlight, maybe. That's all.
reflection of a car headlight. - Yes.
you really expect me to believe that?
Tyler! Hey, you wanna know what you saw?
you saw me get pissed off
that I had to pull your delinquent ass out of a fight.
where could she be?
what is it? Do you hear her?
what's going on, stefan? What is it?
it's blood. I can smell blood.
he's dead.
I killed him.
what's wrong with me?
Hey. Hey, it's ok.
I can help you.
you can?
Yeah. I have to.
what are you going to do?
the only thing I can do.
I'm gonna kill you...
please don't.
I don't want to die.
Yeah, but you're already dead.
no, I'm not.
don't say that. Ok? Just help me.
OK, just-- - ok. Help me, please.
OK, ok, ok. - Please. Please.
it's gonna be ok. It's ok.
it's the only way.
get away from me! You killed me.
no, no, no, no, caroline. That wasn't me.
you know that. That was katherine.
No! Then why does she look like you?
Why--why did she do this to me?
Stefan, we gotta get her inside.
it's all right, caroline. Come with me.
she will die. It's only a matter of time.
Yeah, maybe so, but it's not gonna happen tonight.
Oh, yeah, it is.
Damon, she's my friend.
whatever happens, it's on you.
we've gotta get her cleaned up. - Caroline?
you're not. You can-- You can't be.
Oh, god.
just...
come here. - She hates me.
Bonnie hates me.
no, no, no. She's just in shock. We all are, ok?
and what about matt?
What--what am I gonna do about ma -
one thing at a time. Let's just get this blood cleaned off.
come on. Come on.
I'm a murderer.
I'm a monster.
listen to me. Your emotions are heightened right now.
it's part of the transformation. It's completely normal, I promise you. All right?
why does this keep happening to my face?
I'm--they're hideous.
Caroline, look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
Caroline. Caroline! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me.
look at my face. Look at my face! Look. Look, look, look.
see it? You see that? Yeah?
when you feel the blood rush in, you tell yourself
that you're gonna get through it, that you're strong enough.
Yes. Yes.
no matter how good it feels To give yourself over to it,
you fight it off. You bury it.
watch me. Watch me.
that's the only way you're gonna survive this thing.
try it. Shh. Try it.
there you go. That's good.
why did katherine do this to me?
I don't know. I wish I did.
I promise you I will not let anything happen to you.
come here. Come here.
I can't believe this is happening.
come on. Don't pout about it.
we got a body to bury.
thought you were callin' the shots.
hm s e b.
I told you what would happen if anyone else got hurt.
I didn't do this!
Bonnie, it wasn't his fault.
everything that happens is his fault, elena.
Bonnie, what are you doing?
Bonnie, stop it. Bonnie, bonnie, stop it.
Bonnie, stop it! You're gonna kill him!
what-- Why--why did you stop me?
because this isn't us.
Bonnie, this can't be us.
2
OK. Caroline is ok for now. I'm gonna check in on her later.
but what about the guy that she...
it's taken care of.
Damon's right. Isn't he?
it won't end well for her.
no, I'm gonna make sure that he's wrong.
I just--I can't believe what this day has turned into.
not your normal day, huh?
I was stupid to think that it could be.
I mean, nothing about my life is normal.
my best friend is a witch, My boyfriend's a vampire,
and I have a doppelganger Who's hellbent on destroying all of us.
I'm sorry.
no, it's not your fault, stefan.
it's no one's fault.
you know, it is what it is.
I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just...
you know what? I'm fine. I'm--I'm ok.
I'm gonna call you tomorrow, ok?
good night, stefan.
good night.
I think it's good for tyler to have you in the house.
I appreciate that, carol.
Oh, and I can see if I can dig up that stone you're looking for.
it's bound to be tucked away In one of richard's nooks and crannies.
Hey, man. You headin' up? - In a minute.
night, mom. - Night, tyler.
I'm sorry about earlier. We all good?
Yeah, we're good.
all right.
what the hell are you doin' here?
you don't lock your front door.
Yeah.
I wouldn't. I...
I laced it with vervain.
now, why would you do that?
so I could stake you with this.
you came here to kill me?
it's only fair. You killed me first.
what made you wisen up?
my father hated vampires. My uncle, too.
they were absolute. They knew exactly what they stood for.
I figure maybe I should, too. I mean stand for something.
but killing you, What's that gonna do?
look, I don't do the big-brother thing very well.
sorry I don't have any milk and cookies to offer you.
prick.
wait.
my father hated vampires, too.
he did?
same reason your dad did.
only, it was 1864.
people knew how to whittle.
did you do this?
Yeah, I tried. It's-- It's a little harder than it looks.
what are you doing here?
uh, I came to see if today's basket-case period had expired.
maybe you should just go,'cause my mom's gonna be home soon.
no. Y-you been dodgin' me all day.
I mean, I'm more insecure than you are now.
what do you mean?
it means that you almost died, And it really freaked me out.
and I-it got me thinking, You know,'cause I'm just -
I'm not in a position where I can lose someone else right now.
I realized that even though today I wanted to throttle you,
I'm pretty sure that I'm in love with you,
and now it seems like you don't feel the same way.
Hi. What time is it?
it's almost dawn. Come with me.
Stefan, what are we doing here? We're gonna get caught.
well, I compelled the guard to go on break
so I could kiss my girlfriend at the top of the ferris wheel.
we have to take these moments, elena. All right?
what katherine did to caroline could just be the beginning,
and--and then there's things with tyler's family
that we don't even understand yet.
then there's always the "d" word.
but I came back to this town
to start a life with you.
we can't forget to live it.
listen, how are we gonna get to the top?
I guess you'll just have to hold on tight.
what?
it's just so nice to see you laugh.
it's not gonna get any easier, is it?
no. It's not.
for over a century I have lived in secret. Until now.
I know the risk, and I have to know her.
what are you? -I'm a vampire.
tell me about your ex. Katherine?
she broke your heart.
that was a long time ago.
why do I look like her?
what's your problem?
I don't know. Ok?
so, the black sheep returns.
Tyler? -Who's the guy with Caroline?
I think the lockwoods have a family secret.
they're not vampires. They're something else.
I love Stefan. It's always going to be Stefan.
no, Damon. Stop it!
it's katherine. She undid everything that was good about him.
I hate him, Stefan.
I've had her blood. Katherine obviously killed her.
a plus b equals...
I'm starving.
thanks for coming, ric.
you need something to drink? Coffee? Bourbon?
bourbon in your coffee?
Elena mentioned you needed my help.
Yeah. We were hoping you could help shed some light On the lockwood family.
now, why would I know anything about the lockwoods?
well, you wouldn't. But your dead...
not dead vampire wife might.
Isobel's research, from when you guys were at duke together.
you said that she had spent years researching this town.
Isobel's research here... mystic falls...
was rooted in folklore and legend.
at the time, I thought most of which was fiction.
like that amazing vampire story.
aside from vampires, what else?
lycanthrope.
wait. Like werewolves?
no way. Impossible. Way too lon chaney.
is it?
I've been on this planet 160-some odd years. I've never come across one.
if werewolves exist, where the hell are they?
well, why do you suspect the lockwoods?
because vervain didn't effect the mayor on founder's day
but the gilbert device did.
and it effected his son Tyler.
and at the school carnival, his uncle mason exhibited
inhuman behavior when he fought one of the carnival workers.
it suggested some sort of a supernatural entity.
we were hoping that isobel's research Could help us figure out what it is.
a lot of her things are still at duke.
I mean, her office is still there.
she's technically still missing.
so can we get access to it?
Ric, we need to know what we're dealing with.
if this wolfman thing is true,
I've seen enough movies to know it's not good.
it means that mason lockwood is a real-life lon chaney.
at that little Tyler punk may just very well be lon chaney jr.
which means bela lugosi... meaning me...
is totally screwed.
Hey, I thought you said you were at home.
Tyler's doing a whole thing at the swimming hole.
and I wanted us to spend the day together.
where are you? Call me.
you sure you want to do this?
which part?
digging through my birth mother's lifework
or going to duke with Damon?
either. Both.
well, I'm sure about the first part.
but then again, ric is a good buffer.
so we can bond in our anti-Damon solidarity.
I wish you were coming, though.
you know what, maybe we should wait a couple of days, huh?
wait till Caroline's less of a danger,
and then I can go with you.
it's ok that I'm going, right?
and be honest. Because if it's not then I can just stay here.
and we can take care of Caroline.
no, listen. I want you to go. Ok? I do.
you have questions about your lineage and about katherine.
look, I'm not going to let the fact that Damon is going
keep you from an opportunity to get some answers.
you hate it, though. - I hate it.
and I love you.
I love you, too.
it's been a while.
well, school's been keeping me really busy.
I want you to know it means a lot to me
that Elena has a connection to her mother.
I appreciate you bringing her along today.
Yeah. Well, I figured it was time
to take care of my wife's things, you know?
look, jenna, I know...
things between you and I have been a little start and stop.
and I'm sorry for that.
but maybe once I can... - Uh, no. Don't do that.
not the half, maybe apology, hope for the future thing.
Elena, you coming?
do what you need to do, ok?
Hey, you ok?
Yeah. Just men and their baggage.
sorry you can't come too, stef.
call me if you need anything.
Oh, I'll take really good care of her.
OK. Time to go.
have you ever been down to those old ruins in the woods?
the old lockwood estate?
Yeah. What do you know about it?
it was the original plantation house.
beautiful antebellum architecture.
and if it hadn't burnt to the ground, We'd probably be living in it.
what's the deal with the freaky underground cellar?
we don't talk about those kind of rooms.
why not? - Well, this is the south, honey.
but no one likes to reminisce about the old slave days.
what are you guys talking about?
we were just talking about the old lockwood property.
thinking about having some friends over to the swim hole.
well, be careful. If anything happens on the property, The family is liable.
of course.
I don't know how to make a daywalking ring.
Emily made mine. She made Damon's, too.
instructions must be in the grimoire.
doesn't mean I can cast a spell.
you know how to drop vampires with a single look.
OK? I think you can figure it out.
Caroline killed someone, Stefan.
I can't make it easier for her to do it again.
no. We're not making it easier for her.
we're just giving her the chance to survive.
listen, everyday that she's cut off from her old life...
from you, from Elena, from matt...
it'll make it that much harder For her to hold on to her humanity.
and how do you know she won't hurt anyone else?
I don't. But if we don't do everything we can to help her...
or at least trust the fact that she can keep it together,
we might as well just stake her right now.
I don't know if I can trust her.
not with this. - Then trust me.
how you doing back there? - Leave her alone.
you know, this whole pretending to hate me thing is getting a little silly.
I don't think she's pretending.
you did kill her brother.
there is a huge asterisk next to that statement.
he came back to life.
Yeah. Thanks to a ring that you didn't know he was wearing.
why are you so sure I didn't know?
did you? - Yes.
you're lying.
Elena, I saw the ring.
big tacky thing.
it's hard to miss.
so, I don't get to choose the ring I have to wear the rest of my life?
Hey, if you don't want it...
no. She...she wants it.
now what? - Now's the part where I explain the rules.
the witch who spells the ring has the power to de-spell it.
so, if you ever do anything to hurt anyone...
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
you're a vampire.
that means the urge to kill is a part of who you are.
the minute you let it take over, I will stop you.
Bonnie, you're supposed to be my friend.
I can't ignore what happened. Ok?
if you want to be friends, you're going to have to prove
that the Caroline I remember isn't gone.
now, put the ring on the bed.
do you really think I meant to kill that guy at the carnival?
he's still dead.
now, do you want me to cast the spell or not?
all done.
so, that's it?
I mean, nothing witchy happened.
you know, no flickering lights, no gust of wind.
have you even done this before? - Caroline...
well, I just want to make sure I worked!
it worked.
what if it hadn't, bonnie?!
she's all yours.
so isobel was officially employed by the anthropology department
given that most paranormal phenomena is rooted in folklore.
excuse me. Hi, I'm alaric saltzman.
I called earlier. - Yes.
of course. I'm vanessa monroe, research assistant...Comparative folklore.
uh, let me just grab isobel's keys.
I'm sorry. These are my friends Elena and Damon.
I hope this isn't too much of an imposition.
please. Isobel's office is right through there.
Isobel was one of my first professors.
I'm a grad student. She was brilliant.
one of the reasons I went into folklore.
I have to ask...
has there been any news? - No. No. I'm afraid not.
it's right this way.
I'll grab the light. Feel free to look around.
it's fascinating, isn't it?
Where'd she go?
pull it out. I can't reach it, Elena.
just pull the damn thing out. It hurts.
that bitch is dead.
uh, you're not going to kill her.
watch me.
you touch her and I swear I will never speak to you again.
what makes you think that has any power over me?
cause I took an arrow in the back for you?
you are severely overestimating yourself.
right. I forgot that I was speaking to a psychotic mind
who snaps and kills people impulsively.
fine. Go ahead. Do whatever you want.
you're trying to manipulate me.
if by "manipulate" you mean tell the truth, ok.
guilty.
OK.
please! Ok. I freaked.
all right, you would have done the same thing. It is not possible!
Katherine pierce can't be alive.
and Damon salvatore died in 1864.
OK. I read isobel's research.
well, then you should know just how possible this is.
I'm Elena gilbert, isobel's daughter
and a descendent of katherine pierce.
and this is Damon salvatore, who you just shot.
I'd be extra nice to me right now.
look. We need your help.
OK. We need to see all of isobel's research,
anything related to mystic falls.
so what do I do when I see the rabbit?
chase it, catch it, feed on it.
isn't killing cute, defenseless animals The first step in becoming a serial killer?
well, you sort of skipped serial killer and went straight to vampire.
Hey, Caroline, if you're not serious about all this, I think you should tell me.
no. I am.
look, I swear that I am! Ok. But it's just...
I haven't been in the sun for days.
and everyone's at the swimming hole having fun,
and matt is there. And he finally told me that he loved me.
but I've been blowing him off. And now you want me to eat bunnies.
and I'm kinda freaking out, ok?!
and now you're laughing at me.
no. No. I'm not laughing. None of this is funny, trust me.
it's just that, uh...
What?!
when somebody becomes a vampire,
all their natural behaviors get sort of amplified.
what do you mean?
I mean, as a human I cared deeply for people and how they felt.
if they were hurting, I felt their pain.
and I felt guilty if I was the one that caused it.
and as a vampire,
all of that got...
magnified.
so you're saying that now I'm basically an insecure, Neurotic, control freak on crack.
well, I wasn't gonna say it like that.
but...Hey, listen. Let's hunt. Ok?
and then after that, We'll go to the swimming hole.
Really?! - Yeah.
Matt is the closet connection That you have to your humanity.
and I think that being around him is a good thing.
OK! - Come on.
OK. Bunnies.
this box tracks katherine's arrival to mystic falls In April of 1864.
is that all there is about her?
all that I'm aware of.
here.
take this.
does vervain really work?
Nope! Not at all.
can he hear us? - no! That would be creepy!
can he read minds, too?
you know, if you want to see me naked,
all you have to do is ask.
no. That, he can't do.
he is very capable of being a first rate jackass.
is it me, or did amy bradley's ass get hot?
all class.
Where's forbes? - I wish I knew.
you guys on the outs already?
no. We're fine. I'm fine.
just not sure what she is.
what's your uncle doing here?
you busting us, or you joining us?
neither.
hoping you can make sure everyone's out of here by dark.
what happens after dark?
someone ends up wasted and dead At the bottom of the lake.
you heard your mom. The family's liable if anything happens.
don't be a party killer.
Hey, I didn't say you had to stop partying.
I just said you have to take it elsewhere.
all right. We'll be out of here.
why are you looking at him with your serious vampire look?
my what? My "serious vampire look"?
Mm-hmm. I mean, it's different from your worried vampire look.
neither of which stray too far from your "hey, it's Tuesday" look.
Oh. I get it. Ok.
you think I'm, uh, you think I'm too serious.
I mean, I wasn't going to say it like that. But...
Hey, amy.
you know, you're missing all the fun in the water.
Ah, not waterproof. - Too bad.
so, there's a full moon tonight.
we gonna light a fire later and tell ghost stories?
uh, I don't know.
what the hell? I've been calling you.
I know, I got held up. But I'm here now.
Hey, Caroline.
go find somebody single to stalk, amy.
Seriously? - She was flirting with you.
she's harmless. You don't have to be rude.
you're mad?
you've been dodging my calls all day.
and you get to show up here and be the jealous girlfriend?
it's kinda lame, care.
Hey, I saw that. You compelled her.
Yeah, she deserved it.
Caroline, nobody deserves to have their mind messed with for...Shallow reasons.
you know, why is everyone sticking up for Amy freaking bradley?
you're letting your jealousy get the best of you.
Oh, so now I have magnified jealousy issues too.
that's great. - I told you this wasn't going to be easy.
Yeah, well. Might as well have stayed dead.
my entire personality is killing me.
shut up.
any luck?
there's nothing in here about katherine that we don't already know.
Ah, man. You know, it's a bummer we're not friends anymore.
because I can tell you what I know.
now who's manipulating who?
Hey, guys. Check this out.
there's no record of werewolf mythology in mystic falls.
but here are some records of some of the lesser known legends.
everything from scandinavian skinwalkers to the indistinct.
which roughly translates into "the curse of the sun and moon.
it's native american. - Aztec.
it explains one origin of the werewolf curse traced through virginia.
the short story... 600 years ago,
the aztecs were plagued by werewolves and vampires.
they terrorized the countryside,
made farming and hunting impossible.
until an aztec shaman cursed them,
making vampires slaves to the sun and werewolves servants of the moon.
as a result, vampires could only prowl at night,
and werewolves could only turn on a full moon.
when the full moon crests in the sky,
whosever unlucky enough to fall under the werewolf curse turns into a wolf.
can they control the transformation?
if it were a choice, it wouldn't be called a curse.
werewolves will attack humans.
but instinct and centuries of rivalry
have hardwired them to hunt their prey of choice... Vampires.
well...
if werewolves are hunting vampires, I would know about it.
not if there aren't that many werewolves left alive.
hundreds of years ago, vampires hunted them almost to extinction.
why would they do that? - To protect themselves.
legend has it that a werewolf bite is fatal to vampires.
come on, guys. Tyler wants everyone out of here.
gotta move the party.
he's mad at me.
go talk to him.
I'll wait.
Hey. - Hi. Listen. We've learned some stuff here.
and I know it's going to sound crazy. But I wanted to fill you in.
what's up?
still mad? I thought we were past all this insecurity stuff, Caroline.
I told you how I felt about you. - What more do you need?
nothing. Nothing. I...
I don't need anything else.
I'm sorry, matt. I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so, so, so sorry. - I'm not kidding.
I'm not going to put up with the drama. - NO. No more drama.
just... I promise...just.
come on.
I don't know what it means or if we should even believe it.
but it's a full moon, Stefan. After what you saw mason lockwood do...
I'll be careful.
there's one more thing. - What is it?
according to the legend, A werewolf bite can kill a vampire.
listen, I gotta go. I'll see you when you get home. Ok? - OK
wait, what is this place?
not much farther, amy. - Really, Tyler?
you drag me all the way out here? - I had to move the party. So I'm moving the party.
where are we going? - It's right around this tree.
are you sure? - Oh, yeah. Come on.
OK.
what is this place?
it's a room buried underneath my family's old estate.
no one will know we're down here.
is everyone else coming? - Yeah.
unless you rather I tell them not to.
you're single, right? , yeah.
let's go.
have you done any research on doppelgangers?
well, the word means a lot of different things to different cultures.
but typically a doppelganger Is a living, breathing double of oneself.
did isobel have anything that'd explain the link between me and katherine?
that's all she had on katherine, unfortunately.
but I can tell you that doppelgangers usually torment the people they look like.
trying to undo their lives.
it's not exactly uplifting.
and more things we already know.
just... I want to know why we look alike.
Head-scratcher, isn't it?
do you know something or are you just being yourself?
Well,"if" I know anything, I'm not going to tell you, - not with that attitude. - That's good, Damon.
and this is coming from someone who wants to be my friend.
but you know what?
friends don't manipulate friends.
they help each other.
wait. Wait. No. I'm sorry.
what's the deal? Come on.
no, no, no. Wait, wait. wait. I can't i'm not into it.
then why'd you come with me? - I don't know.
I'm not even really sure I was flirting with you. I like matt.
OK. - I'm gonna go.
Yeah. - Sorry!
- I trust you not to say anything about this to anyone.
or else Damon will kill me in my sleep?
he gave me the 411.
but if you need anything, you can call.
hopefully I won't have to.
but if you do...
listen, you don't want to get caught up in this. Really.
it'll take over. And it'll keep you from being able to live your life.
Isobel's disappearance...
was it related to her research?
Isobel became her research.
she wanted to become a vampire.
she got her wish.
I guess that would put a strain on a marriage.
anyway, I was wondering what it would be like to come back here. It's uh...
it's ok. It's really ok. Feels good to...
have her in my past. You know, it's...
time to move beyond this.
here. Allow me.
you're not going to be able to hate me forever.
can we just go?
you didn't dig deep enough.
petrova." I saw this on the shelf.
Katherine originally came from europe.
Petrova was her real name.
Katharina petrova to be exact.
how did you know that? - Back when, I saw it engraved on an old heirloom.
men snoop, too, you know.
let me know what you find. Very curious myself.
you have every right to hate me. I understand.
you hated me before and we became friends.
it would suck if that was gone forever.
so... Is it?
have I lost you forever?
thank you for the book, Damon.
this looks like the spot.
for what?
did you hear that?
damn. - What happened?
a b
what are you doing? Caroline?
what the hell... your face!
stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop! stop.
Oh, my God. - No, no, stop. Listen to me.
we need to get out of these woods now.
we need to leave. - What was that?
Matt, stay down. Do not move.
you and me, we're gonna run.
it's gonna follow us. We need to get it away from matt.
so, you need to run as fast as you can. Do you understand me?
go. Go!
wait! What is it?! - It's a werewolf!
it will try to kill us, and it can. Hey!
what are you two doing?
what are you doing?
No!
or what you saw me become.
we were just making out in the woods.
and then an animal attacked you And bit your neck.
it's weird. It just came out of nowhere.
what are we going to do about Tyler?
I took care of it.
I'll get matt on vervain.
it'll keep you from being able to compel him, but...
also keep you from being able to drink his blood.
I can't believe I hurt him. - I know.
he's the one person on this entire planet
that I never wanted to hurt.
it's not going to get any easier.
you're just going to have to work that much harder.
I shouldn't be with him, should I?
and if there's any danger...
I'm the last person to make that kind of decision for you.
if I followed my own advice, I would have walked away from Elena a long time ago.
you ever think you should of?
I know I should of.
I just can't.
wanna toss me those?
it was you.
Matt, hey. I can't believe an animal attacked you. - Yeah.
there have been a lot of animal attacks lately. - Well, are you ok?
I've been better. How are you?
I'm ok. I'm just...I'm worried about you.
I'll be fine. - Ok.
seriously, amy?
we were just talking? - Oh, is that what you call it?
are you kidding me? - No, I'm not, matt.
she's into you. And anyone can see it.
look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
I'm just gonna go. - Knock it off.
what are you doing? This isn't my fault, matt. OL
she's after you. And I shouldn't have to put up with that.
I thought you said no more drama. - Well, I lied.
just forget it. Just forget all of it.
so, what, are you, like, breaking up with me?
Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's what I'm doing.
Ric, I wasn't expecting you and Elena till later.
I should have done that this morning.
road trips work well for us.
this doesn't mean that things are back To the way they used to be, Damon.
Oh, come on.
I know I chipped a little bit off of your wall of hatred.
I need to know the truth.
when you broke jeremy's neck, Did you know that he was wearing the ring?
no. No, I didn't.
Katherine really pissed me off. And I snapped. And...
I got lucky with the ring.
and I don't know what I would have done if he wasn't wearing it.
Elena, I'm sorry.
thank you for being honest with me.
and the answer to your question about our friendship...
is yes.
you have lost me forever.
you knew that already, didn't you?
you used me today.
you had information about katherine that I needed to know.
I thought friends don't manipulate friends.
you and katherine have a lot more in common than just your looks.
Elena? - Nope. Try again.
don't be frightened.
we're going to have so much fun together.
Stefan: for over a century, I have lived in secret - Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
what are you? - I'm a vampire.
so tell me about your ex, Katherine.
you must be Elena.
how do we look exactly alike?
I don't want you seeing Elena anymore.
if you don't remove her from your life,
I will kill everyone that she loves.
the Lockwoods are werewolves.
according to my uncle, you have to trigger the curse.
somebody has to die at your hands.
you tried to kill a werewolf and failed.
now you made an enemy.
thank you, Lisa. Let's do this.
each with a stake in the heart, then burn them both.
Hi, mom. - Keep Caroline away from me, please.
she's your daughter, liz. - Not anymore.
I'm just looking for this old piece of my mom's.
it's a moon stone. Thank you.
you got it. - I got it.
you're staring.
I'm gazing.
it's creepy. - It's romantic.
Oh, no, this is bad of us.
mum, yes, it is.
if Katherine finds out... - Katherine who?
ms. Flowers will think I'm a floozy if I have a man in here.
why are you staying here? - Because I like this little bed and breakfast, don't you?
I love it.
OK, I， um, I need to get in the shower.
love it. Let's go.
no, just me. I'm late.
I'm decorating at the Lockwood charity thing.
well, what do you know? So am i.
you think that's really a good idea to be at their house today?
Mason Lockwood tried to kill you.
Where's the moon stone?
it's somewhere safe.
don't you trust me?
I don't trust anyone.
I don't trust Mason.
I want to be there today to keep an eye on him.
OK.
but then we can't touch, or talk.
and no lingering stares.
no. None of that.
what do you think will happen if Katherine finds out that we were fake fighting?
Katherine: you're scared I'm going to kill you?
no. You won't.
ow, Kath, easy!
did I hurt you? Sorry.
did it hurt?
it's ok.
a little bit every day will make you stronger, right?
what happens once I give you the moon stone?
we'll live happily ever after. I promise.
I'll bring it tonight, I promise.
I promise you. We're gonna get through this.
I love you, Stefan.
you know I love you.
I love you, too.
I need to talk to you.
and why do I need to talk to you?
Tyler Lockwood has to kill someone to activate his curse.
he's not a werewolf yet.
Wow. Fascinating. Not enough.
but Mason Lockwood is, and he's looking for a moon stone;
a special connected to the werewolf legend.
that's why he's here.
moon stone?
and I know where it is. - And you're bringing me this why?
do I need a reason? Look, I just want to help, ok?
what did your sister say about this little discovery?
Oh, you haven't told her, have you?
Elena doesn't want me getting involved in all of this.
and you're a Gilbert and you just can't help yourself.
your search for life's purpose is as obvious as it is tragic.
you going to let me in or not?
Jenna. Thanks for helping wrangle the volunteers.
of course. For a good cause.
Plus, I have always been a sucker for a masquerade ball.
so was Richard. This was always his favorite party of the year.
wait, wait, wait, Tyler!
boys! Be careful with that, it's from the 1800s.
excuse me. Tyler!
mom, we got it.
Stefan, hey.
I'm cooking dinner tonight.
Rick will be there. You should come.
you know, Elena and I, we're kind of taking a... A pause.
Really? - Yeah.
cause that's not what it sounded like this morning.
light sleeper.
you know what, I heard nothing.
you're here.
I'm here.
Caroline's not coming. I told you.
just making sure.
you know, eventually you're going to have to talk to her.
could you make it a little less obvious you're on her side?
there are no sides, Bonnie.
Oh, come on.
since Caroline became a vampire, we barely see each other.
losing Caroline was bad enough. I didn't think I'd lose you, too.
come with me.
where?
not here. Some place quiet. We need to talk.
you didn't eat much.
good news!
Dr. Damon said the vervain's almost out of your system.
so with any luck, you'll be freshly compelled and back in your own bed by tonight.
are you really just going to pretend like I don't exist?
Yes. So please go.
as usual, you don't care. Got it.
just like before I was a vampire.
it's not like I died or anything.
are you...
are you really dead?
yes and no.
how is it possible?
Rick! - Yeah.
what are you doing here? - Helping Damon.
I'm the one who found out about the moon stone.
does Elena know you're here?
not exactly. - What you got?
Oh, this is Isabelle's research from duke. Her assistant sent it to me.
hmm. Vanessa, the hottie. - Yeah, Vanessa, yes.
now do you remember the old Aztec curse she told us about?
sun and the moon, blah blah blah. - Aztec curse, cool.
Yeah, supposedly vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
since then, werewolves can only turn on a full moon and vampires are weakened by the sun.
most of them, anyway.
according to the legend, the werewolf part of the curse...
it's sealed with the moon stone.
what do you mean, sealed? - It's a witch thing.
whatever seals the curse, is usually the key to unsealing the curse.
maybe Mason Lockwood believes he can use the moon stone to break the curse.
if we start believing in some supernatural witchy-woo legend from a picture book, we're idiots.
who has the stone now? - Tyler.
can you get it? - Yeah.
see, now your life has purpose.
so you do believe it?
same book that says a werewolf bite kills a vampire.
ignoring it would make me an even bigger idiot. Let's go.
Bonnie: I can't believe this.
Elena: It's a lot, I know.
Katherine has been doing everything that she can to drive me and Stefan apart, and Carolina just got trapped in the middle.
it's not that you and Stefan are pretending to fight.
it's that I didn't even know you guys were fighting at all.
I'm sorry. I don't want to keep things from you, but you've made it pretty clear where you stand with the whole vampire thing.
so that makes me the odd man out.
no. No, Bonnie, of course not.
I know where I stand, Elena.
and I know where you stand.
but where do we stand?
you're my best friend, Bonnie.
I didn't mean to let this craziness with Caroline get in the way of that.
but she needs you, too.
no. Not yet. I just...
she's a vampire. I can't.
I think we should get back.
Hey, Stefan.
Hi, Mason.
wasn't expecting you here. Or anywhere.
Yeah, I had this little accident.
but I'm fine now.
what did you do to sheriff Forbes? - Oh, she's fine, too.
but from now on, you'll have to do your own dirty work.
not a problem.
excuse me.
what's the matter, are you ok?
when I touched him, I saw something.
what do you mean, like a vision?
I saw Elena.
you saw Elena?
he was kissing her.
no, Bonnie, Elena wouldn't kiss...
you didn't see Elena, you saw... Katherine.
Damon, what are you doing here? - Looking for my baby bro.
speaking of, would you tell yours to stop following me around?
what's going on? - Ask eager beaver.
Jeremy, what is he making you do?
he's not making me do anything. Damon and I
Ah, no. No way. No, no, no, no.
there is no Damon and you.
there's Damon and whoever Damon's using.
and those people, they end up dead.
whatever's going on, Jeremy, I want you to stay out of it.
I don't really care what you want, Elena.
it's because of you that I'm in this mess in the first place, so, sorry, you don't really get to tell me what I'm going to do.
Damon: Katherine's with Mason Lockwood?
we missed it. He got into town right after she did. It makes perfect sense.
I know, but Mason Lockwood?!
werewolf thing aside, the guy's a surfer.
she's gotta be using him. She has to be. - Using him for that?
Mason Lockwood's looking for a moon stone that allegedly can break the full moon werewolf curse.
maybe Katherine wants it as well.
Why? - Well... No idea.
it's the beauty of Katherine. She's always up to something.
so how are we going to find this moon stone?
Jeremy's getting it from Tyler.
why would you involve Jeremy?
he's playing indiana jones. He involved himself.
she's this amazing girl one minute and then this raging jealous freak the next.
look, you know what I think of Caroline Forbes.
she's an insecure, neurotic, bitchy little twit.
but the girl's got heart. She means well.
just gotta take the good with the bad sometimes.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go get an extension cord. I'll be right back.
Hey, man.
Hey, so I did a little research on that stone you showed me.
what? Why?
I don't know. Curiosity, boredom. - What'd it say?
well, it turns out that it's part of this aztec legend, but I want to make sure it's the same kind of stone.
do you think I could check it out again?
Nope. Gave it to my uncle.
why'd you do that?
because I'm done with legends and curses.
I don't want anything to do with it, ok?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. It's probably just stupid folklore anyways. Forget it.
Stefan Elena - Ok. Ok. This is as far as I go. - Ok.
what do you want? - A favor.
like that's going to happen. - So predictable. That's why I brought him.
Stefan
I know how you feel about helping us out, but since you're the one that linked to Mason with Katherine, we finally have an opportunity to get an upper hand on both of them, - so just help us out. - Pretty please.
I'm listening.
I have to fill Elena in on what's going on.
can you play nice please?
I guess.
Hey, what are you doing? You shouldn't be calling me.
I know, but I have no idea what's happening.
Damon's got Jeremy into something, and you've got Bonnie with you, and I'm sorting stupid masquerade masks for Mrs. Lockwood.
all right, it's ok. Hold on.
all you need to do is talk to Mason Lockwood again, see if he gave Katherine the moon stone.
my visions don't work like that. I don't get to ask questions.
how inconvenient.
although, let's talk about that little witchy jr. Thing you do with me.
you know, the fun one where my brain bursts into flames? What is that?
that's me giving you an aneurism.
your blood vessels go pop.
but you heal quickly, so I do it over and over again.
is it vampire-specific?
it'd work on anyone with a supernatural healing ability.
good. Good, good.
Damon. I'm not going to help you hurt him.
Mason Lockwood's a werewolf. Katherine's evil. They're the bad guys.
Really? You're going to play morality police with me right now?
let me put it to you in another way - They're a threat to Elena.
so you, witch, are going to get over yourself and help us.
Yeah, he meant that as a question with a "please" on the end.
Absolutely.
Hey, can you move your van? Blocked in.
Hey, how'd you get stuck doing that by yourself?
all the guys bailed. Something about draft picks.
I don't know, I don't speak that language.
here, let me give you a hand.
sorry.
Caroline: so I mainly drink from blood bags.
it's not as good as the fresh stuff, but it beats the animal blood that Stefan's been trying to get me to drink.
so you steal the blood from the hospital?
Damon does.
I've been pilfering his supply, so...
and as long as you have blood, you don't need to kill?
I want to. It's my basic nature now.
but on a healthy diet, I can control it.
I'm getting better at it.
I'm better than Stefan. He's a bit of a problem drinker.
a blood-aholic.
I don't want this for you.
I know.
but when life gives you lemons...
Damon's home.
here's his bag.
as requested.
OK, grab that corner.
why are we doing this?
because I don't want to stain the carpet.
I knew you were going to say something like that.
judging again.
he's not going to be out much longer.
looks like this guy's used to being tied up.
what are you doing?
you're looking for a moon stone. I am trying to help you find it.
Oh, good, yeah. Find out if he gave it to Katherine, and find out where she is.
and find out what they're going to do with it once they get it.
somewhere small.
dark.
there's water.
like a sewer? - no. Like a well?
that can't be right.
Yeah.
it's a well.
why would it be in a well?
I told you, I only get what I get.
that's it. That's all I got.
Hey, judgey.
thank you.
come on. Wake up, wolf boy.
how's your mom?
Elena filled me in on everything.
um, I'm going to take her home tonight.
Caroline... Uh...
never mind, I gotta go.
did you, um, find the moon stone thing?
not yet.
Hey, do you remember that old well where we used to play when we were kids?
Yeah.
it's in the woods. Do you remember where?
on the edge of the old Lockwood property. why?
I think that's where Mason is keeping the moon stone.
I gotta go.
well, I can come with you.
no, it's ok.
sure.
OK.
Where's Caroline? This is like her thing.
I can't believe she's not here.
she had something else to do.
is she seeing someone?
Matt, come on.
no, she's not.
anyone seen Mason?
he, uh, he took off. Said he wasn't sure when he'd be back.
so weird.
Bonnie
I'm not even going to ask.
I'll be right back.
someone's feisty.
What?!
damn it!
you can hurt. Good to know.
I was afraid you were going to be some beast mass with no affinity for pain.
Oh, you heal quickly. Not good.
guess I'll just have to keep applying pain.
so... Katherine.
how do you know her? What's she up to?
I have all day.
what's going on? - You shouldn't be here.
I know, but I am. What's going on?
Bonnie thinks the moon stone is down here.
Hey. Be careful.
only be down there for a minute.
Stefan, what's happening?
what's going on in there?
vervain!
Oh, god! Help!
Caroline, Stefan's down there, and the chain is rusted
no, no, no! You can't. It's filled with vervain.
Caroline, we've got to get him out! now!
when did you two meet?
did she seduce you, tell you she loved you?
you're supernatural so she can't compel you.
I'm sure she used her other charms.
Katherine's good that way.
I thought I told you to leave.
I found something in Rick's box of stuff.
what is it?
um, I did a search on my phone. It's a plant. Aconitum vulparia.
it grows in the mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere, commonly known as aconite, blue rocket and wolfsbane.
what else did you read?
well, every source says something different.
one myth says it causes lycanthropy, which sounds bogus.
and the other one says that it protects people, and another one says, well, it's toxic.
I'm guessing toxic.
what's Katherine doing in mystic falls?
why is she here? - She's here with me.
why do you ask, you jealous?
how rude of me.
you know, I just realized I didn't offer you anything to eat.
yummy!
I got you, ok? - Yeah.
what's going on? You just took off in a blur.
I heard Elena screaming. Help her, now!
you ready? - Yeah.
sorry! - It's ok, keep going. Come on!
Oh, my god!
Elena, what's going on down there?
pull him up!
Elena? Ready for you.
hold on.
hold on! I think I found it!
Elena, what's going on? !
got it! Come on! Bring me up!
Oh, god.
I got the stone, Stefan.
Stefan, it's going to be ok. Everything's going to be ok.
why do you want the moon stone? - Screw you!
wrong answer.
if he was going to say anything, he would already.
I'm taking your eyes now.
the well! You'll find it there.
I know where it is. I want to know what it does and why you want it.
I'm getting it for Katherine. - why?
she's going to use it to lift the curse.
of the moon?
now why would a vampire help a werewolf break a curse that keeps them from turning whenever they want?
so I wouldn't have to turn anymore.
Why? - Because she loves me.
now...now I get it.
you're just stupid.
Katherine doesn't love you. She's using you, you moron.
I'm done talking.
Yes, you are.
time to take a walk, Jeremy.
I'm staying. - No, you should go.
I'm staying, Damon, he's had enough.
just help Tyler.
don't let this happen to him.
you wanted to be a part of this? Well, here it is. Kill or be killed.
the guy's a werewolf. He'd kill me the first chance he got!
so you suck it up, or leave.
he wants me to kill him, anyway.
don't you, Mason?
it really is a curse, isn't it?
you know, I look at you and I see myself.
a less dashing, less intelligent version.
I love her. - Oh, I know!
I've been where you are.
but Katherine will only rip your heart out.
let me do it for her.
you're pretty hand with that thing. - Yeah, well, it's a skill.
here.
Where's the, um, the sea salt?
table.
so I pulled Stefan out of this well, and he's all vervained and just rotted.
but Bonnie wasn't mean to me once, and I just
I really think it's progress, you know?
I just - What?
I'm freaking you out.
it's just that you've become this person
don't. Don't. I...
I'm just starting to get along.
this strong, this confident person.
thank you.
you don't have to take my memories away.
I'll keep your secret.
look, if you're worried about them, just say you compelled me.
I won't tell.
I'll never do anything to hurt you.
we never talk like this. Ever.
and today meant so much to me.
me, too.
I know. I know I can trust you.
but you're never going to trust them.
I'm going to take you home.
you're going to forget that I'm a vampire.
I'm going to forget that you're a vampire.
you'll remember you got sick with the flu.
you had a fever.
chills, and... Ickiness.
and I made you soup.
and it was really salty.
and we bickered.
you got better.
and then your selfish little daughter
who loves you no matter what
went right back to ignoring you.
and all is right in the world.
all this for that? - yep.
I see you've exercised your usual restraint.
had to be done.
big opportunity in florida, I gonna be gone...
for a long time.
I'll send for my things once I get settled.
much love, Mason.
let's get rid of the body.
last number dialed.
I wonder who that could possible be.
no, no, no, don't provoke her.
Mason. You should have been here an hour ago.
wrong boy toy.
Damon. For once you've surprised me.
I assume Mason's with you. - He's right beside me.
although his heart's across the room.
you shouldn't have.
I've had a very busy day today.
killed a werewolf, found a moon stone.
Hey, did you know that he hid the moon stone in a bottom of a well full of vervain?
guess he didn't trust you very much.
he did love you. Poor guy.
Hey, where are you,'cause, you know, I could bring him over.
last good-byes and all that.
you have no idea what you've just done.
Aww, did I put a kink in your master plan? I'm so sorry.
do you honestly believe that I don't have a plan b?
and if that fails, a plan c, then a plan d, and-you know how the alphabet works, don't you?
send my love to Stefan.
Where's Jeremy?
Oh, he went straight up to his room.
he said he wasn't hungry.
who's she talking to?
I don't know. Everything goes ok today?
there were a few hiccups, but yeah.
of course, I understand.
Elena, it's for you. - Who is it?
Hello?
Katherine: hello, Elena.
Katherine. - Did you enjoy your little rendezvous with Stefan this morning?
I will always know, Elena.
I will always be one step ahead of you.
when are you going to figure that out?
do you know how easy it was to get inside of your house?
to replace aunt jenna's vervain perfume, to convince her to stop drinking her special tea.
no. - Jenna's been my little spy for days now.
but unlike you, jenna actually listens to me.
so when I suggested that the world would be a much better place if she were to just
Jenna, no!
well... You get the idea.
Hey, is she ok?
the doctors told alaric that she got lucky.
she's going to make it. She's going to be ok.
does she remember what happened?
no, nothing. It's all part of Katherine's mind compulsion.
why would Katherine hurt Jenna?
because she's trying to send a message that she could get to anybody.
Hey, hey, hey, come here. It's gonna be ok.
no, it's not.
she's going to pay, Elena.
I don't know how, but she's going to pay.
it looks good. - Thanks.
it was nice to see Matt today.
he hasn't been around for a while.
we've both been busy, I guess.
have you seen Mason? The guy's been awol all day.
actually, Tyler, Mason headed back to florida.
What?! - I'm sorry, honey.
I know how much you two hit it off. - So he just left.
I was hoping he'd stick around. I thought that with your dad gone, that...
anyway, he's gone.
so I guess it's just you and me now.
I'm so sorry.
we were stupid.
sneaking around, thinking that we weren't going to get caught.
I know. - We did this.
Stefan, Jenna's in the hospital, and Jeremy could be next.
all because we didn't... We didn't listen to her.
because we're together.
Stefan... - I know what you're going to say.
then let me say it.
I've been so selfish because I love you so much.
and I know how much you love me.
but it's over.
Stefan, it has to be.
Elena, I don't... - No, Stefan.
it has to be.
I riled Katherine up. I...
I wasn't thinking. I didn't think.
it doesn't matter, Damon.
she won.
Katherine won.
I apologize if I seem rattled.
the circumstances have changed suddenly, and I had to adjust.
mind control is a necessary evil.
you see, I need a werewolf, and I've lost the one that I had.
now tell me what you're going to do to help me get a new one.
I'm going to go after Tyler Lockwood.
and you're not going to stop.
and I'm not going to stop.
until?
until he kills me.
vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
since then, werewolves can only turn on a full moon, And vampires are weakened by the sun.
the werewolf part of the curse Is sealed with the moonstone.
so tell me about your ex, Katherine. - You must be Elena.
how do we look exactly alike?
Damon, don't. You need me. Elena's in danger.
the moonstone is what breaks the curse. - Sacrifice is what breaks it,
the blood of the doppelganger. You're the doppelganger.
I wanna be with you, Stefan, But first I need to wake up
and know that the people that I love are safe.
you were running from something. What was it? - Everyone has a past.
the originals, rose and I pissed 'em off. - What did you do?
he trusted Katerina Petrova. - Elijah, I beg your forgiveness.
bulgaria, 1490 Hello, Elena.
a little more, dearest...a little more
Push...a little more
a little more, a little more. Push!
it's a girl.
a girl.
please mother...
