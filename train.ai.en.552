the doe and its predecessor agency put these sites on the list for their scientific promise and partly for reasons of convenience-in the case of yucca mountain, the federal government already owned the place, and it was adjacent to a nuclear weapons test site.
the doe first announced the project, a prototype for the private sector, in 2003. Future gen would be a near zero-emissions plant that converted coal into hydrogen, to power electric turbines, and carbon dioxide, to be pumped underground.
the doe has made loans to nissan, ford, tesla motors, tenneco and fisker automotive, a start-up, for a total of$ 8.5 billion since the programme started in late 2008.
the doe is selling the nuclear fuel to help pay for a clean-up of "contaminated uranium inventories."
the doe team hopes this breakthrough in understanding will similarly open the floodgates on superconductor research, culminating in room temperature materials that move power with no loss of energy.
the doe would oversee future gen and pay 74% of the costs; a group of energy companies, called the future gen alliance, would pay for the rest and design, build and manage the project.
