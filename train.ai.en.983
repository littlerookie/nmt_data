I recognized the carriage when you drove in.
so I went to the beach.
to get as far away from me as you could. - As I could, yes.
it's no use. It's better we face each other. - I only want to be honest with you.
honest?
isn't that why you admired Julius Beaufort?
he was more honest than the rest of us. We've no character.
no colour, no variety.
I don't know why you don't just go back to Europe.
I believe that's because of you.
me? I'm the man who married one woman because another one told him to.
you promised not to say such things today.
I can't keep that promise.
what about May?
what about how May feels?
if you're using my marriage as some victory of ours, then there's no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back.
you gave me my first glimpse of a real life...
...and then you told me to carry on with a false one.
no one can endure that.
I'm enduring it.
what's the use? I know you'll go back. - I won't.
not yet. Not as long as we both can stand it.
this is not a life for you.
it is. As long as it's part of yours.
you won't go back?
I won't go back.
he would see her again at the theatre or a reception.
perhaps he might be seated next to her.
perhaps they might have another time alone somewhere.
but he could not live without seeing her.
Mr. Archer, I think?
Yes.
my name is Rivière.
I dined with you in Paris last year. - Yes, I'm sorry. I didn't quite recall.
quite all right. I had the advantage. I saw you in Boston yesterday.
I came here on Count Olenski's behalf because...
...I believed, in good faith, that she should return to him.
forgive me.
forgive me, monsieur...
...I really don't understand your purpose in coming to see me.
she's changed, monsieur.
you knew her before?
I used to see her at her husband's house, yes.
the Count wouldn't have entrusted my mission to a stranger.
this change that you mentioned...
it may only have been my seeing her for the first time...
...as she is, as an American.
she made her marriage in good faith.
it was a faith the Count could not share, could not understand.
so, her faith was detruit?
broken. Destroyed. - Destroyed.
returning to Europe would mean a life of some comfort...
...and considerable sacrifice.
and, I would think, no hope.
I will, of course, fulfil my obligation to the Count and meet with the family.
I will tell them everything that he suggests and wishes for the Countess.
but I would ask you to use your influence with them.
I beg you, monsieur, do not let her go back.
when old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow died, they found her standing order:
forty-eight Worth dresses, still wrapped in tissue paper.
when her daughters left off their mourning...
...they wore the first lot to the Symphony without looking in advance of the fashion.
he had written to her once in Washington.
just a few lines, asking when they were to meet again.
and she wrote back, "Not yet.
but even that had the front panel changed.
I think it was Julius Beaufort who started the new fashion...
...By making his wife clap her new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived.
I must say, it takes all Regina's distinction not to look like...
her rivals?
like that Annie Ring. - Careful, dear.
everybody knows. - Indeed.
Beaufort always put his business around.
and now that his business is gone, there are bound to be disclosures.
gone? Is it really that bad?
as bad as anything I ever heard of.
most everybody we know will be hit one way or another.
very difficult for Regina, of course.
it's certainly a pity that Countess Olenska refused her husband's offer.
why, for God's sake?
to put it on the lowest ground, what will she live on?
live on?
I mean, now that Beaufort... - What the hell does that mean, sir?
most of her money's invested with Beaufort.
the allowance she's been getting from the family is so cut back...
I'm sure she has something. - I would think a little.
whatever remains after sustaining more debt.
I know the family paid close attention to Monsieur Rivière...
...and considered the Count's offer carefully.
if everyone would rather she be Beaufort's mistress...
...than some decent fellow's wife, you've all gone about it perfectly.
she won't go back.
that's your opinion?
well, no doubt you know.
I soppose she might still soften Catherine Mingott who could give her an allowance...
...but the rest of the family have no interest in keeping her here.
they'll simply let her find her own level.
evening, sir.
thank you.
that lamp is smoking again. The servants should see to it.
I'm sorry.
I may have to go to Washington for a few days.
when?
tomorrow. I'm sorry, I should have said it before.
on business?
on business. There's a patent case coming up before the Supreme Court.
I just got the papers from Letterblair.
it seems that he intended... - Never mind. It sounds too complicated.
I have enough trouble managing this lamp. - Here, let me try that.
but the change will do you good.
and you must be sure to go and see Ellen.
excuse me, ma'am, but this came for you while you were out.
do something about this, will you, Agnes? - Certainly, sir.
granny's had a stroke.
a stroke? Ridiculous.
I told them all it was just an excess of Thanksgiving.
Dr. Bencomb acted most concerned and insisted on notifying everyone...
...as if it were the last reading of my will and testament.
you're very dear to come.
but perhaps you only wanted to see what I'd left you.
granny, that's shocking! - It was shock that did this to me.
no, thanks.
it's all due to Regina Beaufort.
she came here last night...
...and she asked me... she asked me...
...she had the effrontery to ask me to back Julius.
not to desert him, " she said.
to stand behind our common lineage in the Townsend family.
if you back Julius, you can see the family through.
if you don't...
...we will all, every one of us, fall into dishonour.
I said to her, "Honour's always been honour and honesty's always been honesty in Manson Mingott's house and will be till I'm carried out feet first.
and then she said, if you can believe this, "But my name, Auntie.
but my name, Auntie! My name's Regina Townsend!
and I said to her:
your name was Beaufort when he covered you with jewels...
... and it's got to stay Beaufort now that he's covered you with shame!
then I gave out.
I simply gave out.
now family is arriving from all over expecting a funeral...
...and they'll have to be entertained.
I don't know how many notes Bencomb sent out.
if there's anything we can do to help...
my Ellen is coming.
I expressly asked for her.
she arrives this afternoon on the train. If you could fetch her
of course, if May will send the brougham, I'll take the ferry.
fine.
thank you.
there, you see, Granny? Everyone will be settled.
thank you, dear. Bless you.
I didn't want to worry Granny, but how can you meet Ellen and bring her here...
...if you have to go to Washington yourself this afternoon?
well, I'm not going. The case is off. Postponed.
I heard from Letterblair this morning.
postponed? How odd.
mama had a note from him this morning as well.
he was concerned about Granny, but had to be away.
he was arguing a big patent case before the Supreme Court.
you did say it was a patent case?
well, that's it. The whole office can't go and Letterblair decided to go himself.
so, then, it's not postponed?
no, but my going is.
he knew it was two hours by ferry and carriage from the Pennsylvania terminus in Jersey City back to Mrs. Mingott's.
all of two hours, and maybe a little more.
you didn't expect me today? - No.
I nearly came to Washington to see you. We would have missed each other.
it's Granny Mingott who sent me. She's much better.
do you know, I hardly remembered you?
hardly remembered?
I mean, each time it's the same.
you happen to me all over again.
Yes, I know. For me, too.
Ellen, we can't stay like this. It can't last.
I thinke we should look at reality, not dreams. - I just want us to be together.
I can't be your wife, Newland.
is it your idea I should live with you as your mistress? - I want...
somehow, I want to get away with you.
find a world where words like that don't exist.
Oh, my dear.
where is that country? Have you ever been there?
is there anywhere we can be happy behind the backs of people who trust us?
I'm beyond caring about that. - No, you're not.
you've never been beyond that.
I have.
I know what it looks like. It's no place for us.
why are we stopping? This isn't Granny's.
no. I'll get out here.
you were right. I shouldn't have come today.
what are you reading?
it's a book about Japan.
Why?
I don't know.
because it's a different country.
you used to read poetry.
it was so nice when you read it to me.
Newland, you'll catch your death.
of course.
but then he realised, "I am dead.
I've been dead for months and months.
then it occurred to him that she might die.
people did. Young people, healthy people did.
she might die. Set him free.
Newland?
Ellen, I have to see you.
I didn't know when you were leaving again.
I-I'm not leaving. Granny's asked me to stay and take care of her.
then we have to talk now.
I'm due at Regina Beaufort's. Granny lent me her carriage.
I know Granny says Julius Beaufort is a scoundrel...
...but so is my husband and the family wants me to go back to him.
only Granny understands. She's even seen to my allowance.
I have to see you, somewhere we can be alone.
in New York? - Alone. Somewhere we can be alone.
the art museum in the park? 2: 30 tomorrow.
I'll be at the door.
you came to New York because you were afraid.
afraid? - Of my coming to Washington.
I thought I would be safer.
safer from me?
Ellen?
safer from loving me?
shall I come to you once and then go home?
come to me once then.
when?
tomorrow.
the day after.
I'm sorry I'm late. You weren't worried, were you?
is it late? - It's past 7: 00.
I stayed at Granny's because Cousin Ellen came in.
we had a wonderful talk. She was so dear.
just like the old Ellen.
granny was so charmed by her.
but you can see how the family has been annoyed with her at times.
going to see Regina Beaufort in Granny's carriage.
are we dining out tonight?
you haven't kissed me today.
it was the custom in old New York...
...for brides to appear in their wedding dress in the first year or two of marriage.
but May, since returning from Europe, had not worn her gown until this evening.
may, I'm sorry. My head's bursting.
please don't tell anyone. Come home with me now.
shouldn't you rest?
my head's not as bad as that.
and there's something important I have to say to you right away.
may, there is something that I've got to tell you about myself.
Madame Olenska...
why should we talk about Ellen tonight?
because I should have spoken before, and...
is it really worthwhile, dear? I know I've been unfair to her at times.
perhaps we all have.
you've understood her better than any of us, I suppose...
...but does it really matter, now that it's all over?
how do you mean, "over"?
why, since she's going back to Europe so soon.
granny's approved and understands. She's disappointed, of course...
...but she's arranged to make Ellen financially independent of the Count. I...
I thought you would have heard today at your offices.
it's impossible. - Impossible?
certainly, she could have stayed here with Granny's extra money...
...but I guess she's given us up, after all.
how do you know that?
from Ellen. I told you, I saw her at Granny's yesterday.
and she told you that yesterday?
no. She sent me a note this afternoon.
do you want to see it?
I thought you knew.
may, dear. I have at last made Granny understand...
... that my visit to her could be no more than a visit.
and she has been as kind and generous as ever.
and she has been as kind and generous as ever.
she sees now that if I return to Europe, I must live by myself.
I am hurrying back to Washington to pack up and I sail next week.
you must be very good to Granny when I'm gone...
...as good as you've always been to me.
if my friends wish to urge me to change my mind, please tell them it would be utterly useless.
it would be utterly useless.
why did she write this?
I suppose because we talked things over yesterday.
what things?
I told her that I was afraid I hadn't always been fair to her.
that I hadn't always understood how hard it must have been for her here.
I knew you'd be the one friend she could always count on...
...and I wanted her to know that you and I were the same in all of our feelings.
she understood why I wanted to tell her this.
I think she understands everything.
my head aches, too.
good night, dear. - Good night.
it was, as Mrs. Archer said to Mrs. Welland:
a great event for a young couple to give their first dinner...
... and it was not to be undertaken lightly.
there was a hired chef...
...Two borrowed footmen, roses from Hendersons...
...Roman punch and menus on gilt-edged cards.
it was considered a particular triumph that the van der Luydens...
...at May's request, stayed in the city to be present at her farewell dinner for the Countess Olenska.
...had to leave New York after the disgrace, whatever it was.
archer saw all the harmless looking people at the table as quiet conspirators...
...with himself and Ellen the centre of their conspiracy.
he guessed himself to be, for months, the centre of silently observing eyes and patiently listening ears.
he understood that, somehow...the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved.
and he knew that now the whole tribe had rallied around his wife.
he was a prisoner in the centre of an armed camp.
Regina's not well at all...
...but that doesn't stop Beaufort from seeing Annie Ring when he can manage.
Beaufort could go and stay at Regina's place in North Carolina.
he could breed trotters.
and the key to his release had been returned the day before by mail...
...unopened.
perhaps he'll run for public office.
then will Annie Ring be his first lady?
was your trip from Washington very tiring?
the heat on the train was dreadful...
...but all travel has its hardships.
whatever they may be, they're worth it just to get away.
I mean to do a lot of travelling myself, soon.
what about you, Philip? What about a little adventure?
athens and Smyrna, maybe even Constantinople.
possibly.
but not Naples. Dr. Bencomb says there's a fever.
Really? A fever in Naples.
there's always India, of course.
you need three weeks to do India properly.
Absolutely.
Beaufort may not receive invitations anymore...
...but it's clear he still maintains a certain position.
horizontal, from all I've heard.
if this continues, we'll be seeing our children fighting for invitations to swindlers' houses and marrying Beaufort's bastards.
has he got any?
be careful there, gentlemen. Draw it mild. Draw it mild.
society has a history of tolerating vulgar women, after all.
up to a point.
but once it tolerates men of that kind, the only prospect is...
have you ever noticed?
it's the people with the worst cooks...
...who are always yelling about being poisoned when they dine out.
Lefferts used to be a little more adept, I thought.
but then, grace is not always required as long as one knows the steps.
mark you, I hear that...
I've never heard Lefferts so abound in the sentiments that adorn Christian manhood.
indignation lends a scathing eloquence. It's almost as effective as fear.
the pressure at home must be unrelenting.
I never expected to hear a paean to the sanctity...
the silent organization which held this whole small world together...
...was determined to put itself on record.
it had never questioned the propriety of Madame Olenska's conduct.
it had never questioned Archer's fidelity.
and it had never heard of, suspected, or even conceived possible anything at all to the contrary.
Ellen?
from the seamless performance of this ritual...
...Archer knew that New York believed him to be Madame Olenska's lover.
...discussing the Martha Washington Ball.
Yes, we have it during Easter week, to benefit the Blind Society.
and he understood, for the first time, that his wife shared the belief.
you must come visit me when you do. - Yes.
I'll write to you as soon as I'm settled and let you know where I am.
Oh, yes. That would be lovely.
shall I see you to your carriage?
we're driving dear Ellen home.
good-bye.
good-bye. I'll see you very soon in Paris.
Oh, if you and May could come.
shall we make our way to the carriage, my dear?
delightful evening, Newland. - Good night, Newland.
good night, Sillerton. 'Night, Larry.
it did go off beautifully, didn't it? - Oh, yes.
may I come in and talk it over? - Of course.
but you must be very sleepy. - No, I'm not. I'd like to be with you a little.
fine.
if you feel up to it, May...
...there is something that I've been wanting to talk to you about.
and I tried to talk to you the other evening.
Oh, yes, dear. Something about yourself. - About myself, yes.
it's so difficult to find the right words.
it's just that I feel so terribly tired at the moment and I think, each day, a little more so.
I think it would be better for everyone if I were to make a break.
you mean give up the law?
well, certainly, that would be a part of it. And also, just to get away.
I'd like to do some travelling.
to Europe?
perhaps even farther.
how far?
I don't know. I thought India or Japan.
as far as that?
I'm afraid you can't, dear.
not unless you take me with you.
that is, if the doctors will let me go, and I'm afraid they won't.
I've been sure of something since this morning and I've been longing to tell you.
Oh, my dear.
you didn't guess?
no.
I mean, of course I hoped, but...
have you told anyone else?
only Mama and your mother.
and Ellen.
I told you we had a long talk one afternoon and how wonderful she was to me.
did you mind my telling her, Newland?
mind? Why should I?
that was two weeks ago, wasn't that?
I thought you just said you weren't sure till today.
no. I wasn't sure then, but I told her I was.
and you see, I was right.
it was the room in which most of the real things of his life had happened.
their eldest boy, Theodore, too delicate to be taken to church in mid-winter...
...had been christened there.
I baptize you in the name of the Father...
...and of the Son...
...and of the Holy Spirit.
it was here that Ted took his first steps.
and it was here that Archer and his wife always discussed the future of all their children:
bill's interest in archaeology, Mary's passion for sport and philanthropy.
Ted's inclination toward art, that led to a job with an architect as well as some considerable redecoration.
it was in this room that Mary had announced her engagement...
I'm so happy for you.
...to the dullest and most reliable of Larry Lefferts' many sons.
and it was in this room, too, that her father had kissed her through her wedding veil before they motored to Grace Church.
he was a dutiful and loving father and a faithful husband.
when May died of infectious pneumonia, after nursing Bill safely through...
...he had honestly mourned her.
the world of her youth had fallen to pieces and rebuilt itself without her ever noticing.
this hard, bright blindness...her incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their views from her just as Archer concealed his.
she died thinking the world a good place...
...full of loving and harmonious households like her own.
newland Archer, in his 57th year...mourned his past, and honoured it.
Yes, hello? hello?
Chicago wants you.
Hello?
dad? - Is that you, Ted?
I'm about finished out here, but my client wants me to look at some gardens before I start designing.
that sounds fine. Where? - Europe.
gracious. - I'll sail next Wednesday on the Mauritania.
what, and miss the wedding? - I think Annie will wait for me.
I'll be back on the first. Our wedding's not till the fifth.
I'm surprised you remembered the date. - Well, dad, I was hoping you'd join me.
what?
I'll need you to remind me of what's important.
what do you say? It'll be our last father and son trip.
Ted, I do appreciate the invitation... - Great! Call the Cunard office tomorrow.
it'll take me a week to cancel... - I won't hear it, Dad. The Atlantic calls us.
I'll be in New York on Monday and I'll contact you then.
you'll be in New... - Monday.
I'll see what I can do. - Settle the tickets.
I can't promise anything. I'll see what I can do, all right?
all right. Bye.
I'm going out to Versailles with Tourneur. Will you join us?
I thought I'd go to the Louvre.
I'll meet you there later, then.
countess Olenska's expecting us at half past 5: 00.
what? - Oh, didn't I tell you?
Annie made me swear to do three things in Paris:
get her the score of the last Debussy songs...
...go to the Grand Guignol and see Madame Olenska.
you know, she was good to Annie when Mr. Beaufort sent her over to the Sorbonne.
wasn't the Countess friendly with Mr. Beaufort's first wife?
I think Mrs. Beaufort said that she was.
in any case, I called the Countess first thing this morning...
...introduced myself as her cousin...
... and asked if she would... - Did you tell her I was here?
of course. Why not?
she sounds lovely. Was she?
lovely?
I don't know. She was different.
whenever he thought of Ellen Olenska...
...it had been abstractly, serenely...
...like an imaginary loved one in a book or picture.
she had become the complete vision of all that he had missed.
I'm only 57.
did Mr. Beaufort have such a bad time of it when he wanted to remarry?
no one wanted to give him an inch?
perhaps because he'd already taken so much.
as if anyone remembers anymore, or cares.
well, Annie Ring and he did have a lovely daughter.
you're very lucky.
we're very lucky, you mean?
Yes, of course, that's what I mean.
considering how that all turned out and considering the time that's gone by...
...I don't see how you can resist.
I did have some resistance at first to your marriage, as I've told you...
no.
I mean, resist seeing the woman you almost threw everything over for.
only you didn't.
I didn't?
no.
but Mother said she knew we'd be safe... - Your mother?
Yes. The day before she died, she asked to see me alone. Remember?
she said she knew we were safe with you and always would be...
...because once, when she asked you to...
...you gave up the thing that you wanted most.
she never asked.
she never asked me.
after a little while, he did not regret Ted's indiscretion.
it seemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that...
...after all, someone had guessed and pitied.
and that it should have been his wife moved him inexpressibly.
the porter says it's the third floor.
must be the one with the awnings.
it's nearly 6: 00.
I think I'll just sit for a while.
do you mean you won't come?
you really won't come at all? - I don't know.
she won't understand.
go on, Ted. Maybe I'll follow you.
wha-what will I tell her?
don't you always have something to say?
I'll tell her you're old-fashioned and you insist on walking up three flights instead of taking the elevator.
just say I'm old-fashioned.
that should be enough. Go on.
go on.
a mother protected her son.
here in america, we actually get divorced
before we get married again.
I will explain it all away.
your father told me you Called off the wedding.
evil came to wisteria lane.
Susan, how is she?
we don't know yet. Nobody's talking to us.
it struck again...
I can't believe she's dead.
I didn't really know her, but i Guess we're sort of connected now.
you would've liked her.
and fear set in.
whoever attacked julie Is still out there.
there is obviously a Madman on the loose.
the stage was set...
I'm a little out of your League, don't you think?
for the killer...
what are you doing?
to strike again.
there is a house in The town of fairview.
inside this house Lives a monster
the kind who kills young women.

and that's a very good question, indeed.
I'm out of scotch.

no. And stay out of there.

you can wait a little while, right?
his name was eddie.
everyone thought he was harmless...
until the day his mother Went into his room.
she was just looking For a bottle of scotch...
but found the truth instead.
soon everyone in town would be asking, "how could such a monster come to be?
sadly, the answer...
would satisfy no one.
I met eddie on a monday.

I SEE.
she SORT OF THINKS YOU'RE EVIL.
thank YOU, EDIE.
what WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
Susan MAYER'S OBSESSION WITH MARY ALICE ALMOST GOT ME ARRESTED.
now PAUL'S AFTER HER.
if I LIKED HER BETTER, I'D WARN HER, BUT...
you KNOW.
Thanks.
uh, I'LL TALK TO YOU GIRLS LATER.
still AVOIDING ME, HUH?
no, NO.
what DO YOU WANT?
I HEARD THAT YOU AND EDIE BROKE INTO PAUL YOUNG'S HOUSE.
who TOLD YOU THAT?
Yeah, WE DID. UM...
we WERE JUST LOOKING...
it DOESN'T MATTER. IT WAS DUMB.
listen, I WANT YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT GUY.
well, I WAS PLANNING ON DOING THAT ANYWAY.
good.
I KNOW WHY I WAS PLANNING ON STAYING AWAY FROM HIM.
why DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY AWAY FROM HIM?
I JUST KNOW HE'S A BAD GUY.
so PLEASE DON'T MESS WITH HIM.
I WON'T.
I PROMISE.
so I'VE BEEN THINKIN ABOUT THE PHARMACIST.
George. WHAT ABOUT HIM?
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD GO OUT WITH HIM.
please DON'T BE THIS WAY.
he's THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE WHO'S INTERESTED INULTURAL THINGS.
I'm WORRIED BECAUSE HE IS OBVIOUSLY STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU.
no, HE JUST WANTS TO BE FRIENDS.
he TOLD ME SO.
well, WHAT ELSE WOULD A MAN IN LOVE SAY?
he's DESPERATE TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.
he DOES NOT SEEM DESPERATE TO ME.
I SAW THE WAY HIS HANDS TREMBLED WHEN YOU TOUCHED HIS SHOULDER.
they DID?
when WE FIRST STARTED DATING, THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME.
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
listen, CONTINUING TO SEE HIM WOULD JUST BE GIVING HIM FALSE HOPE.
well, I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM...
again.
no.
you DON'T.
I EVEN THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO SWITCH PHARMACIES.
Really?
well, OKAY.
you KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO MISS MOST ABOUT HIM?
george ALWAYS HAS A WAY OF MAKING ME FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.
Yeah, HE'S A TERRIFIC GUY.
honey, DO YOUR HANDS STILL TREMBLE WHEN THEY TOUCH ME?
no.
but COME ON, WE'VE BEEN MARRIED 18 YEARS.
Yes, WE HAVE.
and YOU STILL DON'T KNOW WHEN I NEED YOU TO LIE.
excuse ME.
um, THIS HOME PREGNANCY TEST...IS IT A GOOD ONE?
I GUESS.
okay, UM, DO YOU HAVE A RESTROOM?
it's FOR EMPLOYEES ONLY.
Oh, IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE,
Mrs. SOLIS. HELP YOURSELF.
thank U.
what DID I TELL YOU ABOUT BEING RUDE TO CUSTOMERS?
you'll STICK A SMILE ON YOUR FACE,
or I'LL KEEP YOU IN BACK STOCKING SHELVES WHERE NO ONE HAS TO LOOK AT YOU.
what A PLEASANT SURPRISE.
what BRINGS YOU HERE?
didn't WE JUST FILL DR. VAN DE KAMP'S PRESCRIPTION LAST WEEK?
George, AS IT TURNS OUT,
I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO WITH YOU TO THE BONSAI EXPO.
Oh. WHY NOT?
I THINK IT'D BE A MISTAKE FOR US TO SPENDOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER.
Dr. VAN DE KAMP SAID SOMETHING ABOUT ME.
what WAS IT?
it DOESN'T MATTER.
please, TELL ME.
he SAID YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH ME.
that's
that's STUPID.
I'm NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU.
I'm NOT.
the TRUTH IS,
I'm IN LOVE WITH GINGER.
ginger THE STOCK GIRL?
Yes. IT'S VERY SERIOUS.
Oh.
why DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
well, WE'RE TAKING IT SLOW,
but SHE IS DEFINITY THE ONE.
Oh, MY GOODNESS. WELL, THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.
listen, UM,
a FRIEND OF MINE IS HAVING A BARBECUE FOR HER HUSBAND ON SATURDAY,
and I THINK YOU SHOULD COME.
Really?
Yes, AND BRING GINGER.
I DON'T KNOW IF SHE CAN MAKE IT.
well, YOU HAVE TO BRING GINGER,
because IF REX SEES THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER,
then HE'LL RELAX.
Oh. UH...
okay.
son OF A BITCH!
you ARE OUT OF TOILET PAPER.
Bree, I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
Hey, HONEY?
are YOU HOME?
three MONTHS?
God, YOU
you SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME.
were YOU EVER GOING TO TELL ME?
I WANTED TO,
but I KEEP PUTTING IT OFF.
I KNEW HOW YOU'D REACT.
Congratulations. YOU READ ME LIKE A BOOK.
why WOULD YOU HIRE THAT WOMAN?
look, TECHNICALLY, PETERSON FOUND HER.
I JUST VOUCHED FOR HER.
come ON, HONEY, I'M JUST HELPING HER OUT.
it's THE LEAST I CAN DO.
look, SHE WAS DEVASTATED WHEN I LEFT HER FOR YOU.
I FELT BAD.
do YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER?
all RIGHT, I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.
come ON, YOU CAN TELL ME.
you STILL CARE ABOUT HER, DON'T YOU,
just A TEENY, TINY LITTLE BIT.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE A GOOD GUY.
that's ALL.
well, YOU CAN'T WORK WITH HER.
what DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, QUIT?
talk TO PETERSON.
maybe HE CAN GET HER TRANSFERRED.
I MEAN, WEREN'T YOU GUYS PLANNING ON STARTING SOMETHING UP IN BELIZE?
honey, YOU'RE CRAZY.
no, I'M SERIOUS.
if SHE STAYS, I WILL HAUNT YOUR OFFICE.
I'll BRING YOU LUNCH EVERY DAY.
I'll BRING THE KIDS TO VISIT.
I WILL CHANGE DIAPERS ON YOUR DESK.
every BIRTHDAY CAKE IN THE BREAK ROOM,
every RETIREMENT PARTY,
I WILL BE THERE...
watching HER.
well, I BETTER GET YOU A PARKING SPACE, 'CAUSE SHE'S STAYING.
don't YOU THINK IT SPICES UP THE ROOM?
Oh, I WAS JUST LEAVING YOU A GIFT
to APOLOGIZE FOR, YOU KNOW,
throwing GRAVEL IN YOUR FACE.
well, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
no, I KIND OF DID.
see, I WANT US TO BE FRIENDS.
Yeah, WELL...
that's NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
why NOT?
aside FROM YOU BLINDING ME?
you KNOW, SEVERAL WEEKS AGO,
you FREAKED OUT IN MY HOUSE.
you SCREAMED, YOU THREW FURNITURE AROUND.
okay, WELL, I REALIZE THAT I WAS OUT OF LINE THAT NIGHT,
but I WAS UPSET.
and WE HAVE TO GET OVER THAT
for JULIE'S SAKE.
for JULIE'S SAKE?
how DO YOU THINK IT MAKES HER FEEL THAT HER MOTHER AND HER BOYFRIEND CAN'T EVEN GET ALONG?
Hey, ZACH,
Julie DOES NOT THINK OF YOU AS HER BOYFRIEND.
in FACT...
I DON'T THINK SHE WANTS ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU.
she SAID THAT?
Yeah.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
believe WHATEVER YOU WANT.
well, IF SHE DID, IT'S BECAUSE YOU TELL HER STUFF ABOUT ME THAT'S NOT TRUE.
Zach! COME HERE!
right NOW!
please DON'T RUIN THIS FOR ME.
how DO YOU KNOW MARY ALICE?
who?
she LIVES NEXT DOOR TO ME IN FAIRVIEW.
she's STANDING RIGHT HERE IN THIS PICTURE WITH YOU.
that's ANGELA FORREST.
we WORKED TOGETHER AT THE REHAB CENTER 15 YEARS AGO.
don't BE DENSE, FELICIA.
don't YOU THINK I KNOW MY OWN NEIGHBOR?
does THIS MARY ALICE HAVE CHILDREN?
a TEENAGER -- A BOY.
what?
angela AND I WORKED TOGETHER WITH A VERY DISTURBED YOUNG WOMAN
who GAVE BIRTH TO A BABY BOY.
about A YEAR LATER,
angela AND HER HUSBAND...
disappeared.
not LONG AFTER THAT,
I HEARD THAT THE CHILD WAS MISSING, TOO.
people SAID IT WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE,
but IN MY HEART,
I ALWAYS HOPED THAT SHE HAD GIVEN HIM A PROPER HOME.
are YOU SAYING SHE STOLE THE BABY?
don't LOOK SHOCKED, MARTHA.
it MAKES YOUR FACE LOOK FAT.
the BIOLOGICAL MOTHER WAS A DRUG ADDICT.
if ANGELA REALLY IS YOUR NEIGHBOR,
which I DOUBT,
then THAT CHILD WAS VERY LUCKY.
Lynette, HEY.
Oh, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TOM, HE'S OUT WITH A CLIENT.
no, I ACTUALLY WANTED TO SEE YOU.
you KNOW, THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING.
I've BEEN HERE ALL THIS TIME.
we SHOULD GO OUT
for LUNCH, JUST THE TWO OF US.
Yeah, I'LL CHECK MY BOOK.
so, ANNABEL...
do YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR TOM?
what?
you HEARD ME.
okay, YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS, LYNETTE?
let's TALK.
Yes, TOM AND I WERE IN LOVE,
but HE MARRIED YOU.
I'm NOT LOOKING TO BREAK UP A HAPPY COUPLE.
anyway, THAT'S REALLY MORE YOUR SPEED, ISN'T IT?
morning, LADIES.
just COMING IN FOR A LITTLE MORE FUEL.
Yep, ONE MAN'S SLUDGE IS ANOTHER MAN'S LIQUID GOLD.
well, BACK TO THE TRENCHES.
watch YOUR STEP.
Tom AND I, WE'RE A TEAM.
our MARRIAGE IS ROCK SOLID.
nothing YOU DO COULD EVER BREAK THAT UP.
then WHY ARE YOU DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW
warning ME?
Gabrielle. WHAT BRINGS YOU DOWN HERE?
Oh, SWEET MOTHER OF GOD,
what HAVE YOU DONE THIS TIME?
you're PREGNANT?
Yes, AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I AM ON THE PILL.
which I KNOW YOU PROBABLY THINK IS A SIN, BUT IT WORKS.
it's A 99. 9% EFFECTIVE SIN.
well, MAYBE IT'S IN THAT 1/10th OF A PERCENT THAT GOD RESIDES.
couldn't WAIT TO THROW THAT IN, COULD YOU?
look, GOD IS SCREWING WITH ME.
he DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE,
so HE'S PUNISHING ME.
well, HAVE YOU DONE SOMETHING THAT WOULD WARRANT BEING PUNISHED?
the GARDENER?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS OVER.
well, IT WAS, AND THEN -- AND
well, YOU JUST HAD TO BE THERE.
look, THAT'S MY POINT IS I'D BE AN AWFUL MOTHER.
I'm SELFISH, AND I'M SELF-CENTERED,
and THE ONLY PERSON MORE SELF-CENTERED THAN ME IS CARLOS.
I MEAN, HE'S SO SELF-CENTERED
that HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW SELF-CENTERED I AM.
we'd BE TERRIBLE PARENTS.
Gabrielle, I'D LIKE TO HELP,
but I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT IT IS YOU WANT.
you KNOW, IT'S JUST
I WANT TO KNOW WHO TO BE ANGRY AT.
here's A THOUGHT. DON'T BE ARY.
be THANKFUL.
children ARE A GIFT, ARE THEY NOT?
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS CRAP.
I HAVE A PARTY TO PLAN.
Thanks.
Edie. HEY. - HI.
wow, THINGS ARE REALLY COMING ALONG.
Yeah, SLOWLY AND EXPENSIVELY.
well, IT'LL BE WORTH IT.
you're DOING AN AMAZING JOB.
so, LOOK, YOU'RE BASICALLY A PREDATOR,
and I-I NEED SOME ADVICE.
and I KNOW TOM LOVES ME,
but I DON'T TRUST THIS WOMAN.
I THINK THERE'S AN AGENDA THERE.
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I'M BEING PARANOID.
no, NO.
you DID THE RIGHT THING COMING TO ME.
there ARE TWO WAYS TO APPROACH THIS.
well, FIRST I HAVE TO ASK
what KIND OF SHAPE IS THIS WOMAN IN?
fantastic SHAPE. SHE'S GORGEOUS.
okay, NOW THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE WAY TO APPROACH THIS.
you're GOING TO HAVE TO ACT FAST.
I'm -- I'M LISTENING.
well, IT'S REALLY PRETTY SPLE.
wh I FEEL THREATENED BY A WOMAN,
I PULL HER IN.
I MAKE HER MY BEST FRIEND.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEMALE FRIENDS.
I DON'T.
and I'VE NEVER FELT THREATENED BY ANOTHER WOMAN, EITHER.
but THE POINT IS
keep YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE...
keep YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER.
Tom, WE'RE HAVING A DINNER PARTY.
I'm THINKING OF INVITING ANNABEL.
we're NOT MOVING.
Susan KNOWS SOMETHING.
Edie SAID SHE FOUND --- I DON'T CARE WHAT EDIE BRITT SAID.
I'm NOT LEAVING JULIE.
you WANT TO RISK OUR LIVES, OUR FUTURE,
over SOME SCHOOLYARD CRUSH?
it IS MORE THAN THAT. JULIE LOVES ME.
then WHY DOES SHE REFUSE TO SEE YOU?
Mrs. MAYER LIES TO HER.
if IT WASN'T FOR THAT, SHE WOULD BE WITH ME.
are YOU SURE?
you KNOW, JULIE'S A VERY SPECIAL GIRL.
I KNOW.
she COULD HAVE JUST ABOUT ANY BOY SHE WANTED.
I THINK YOU'RE AONDERFUL KID,
I DO, BUT...
you're NOT THAT SPECIAL, ZACH.
not REALLY.
but SHE KISSED ME.
lately?
let's JUST PACK OUR BAGS AND GET OUT OF HER
we CAN LEAV THIS WHOLE MESS BEHIND. WE CAN START OVER.
and THERE WILL BE OTHER GIRLS, I PROMISE.
no.
if SUSAN GOES TO THE POLICE, IT'S OVER.
they'll TAKE ME AWAY.
they'll TAKE YOU AWAY. DON'T YOU GET THAT?
if JULIE DOESN'T LOVE ME ANYMORE,
then IT DOESN'T MATTER.
none OF IT MATTERS.
MCGRUDER HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON.
during THE ENTIRE SHIP FOR THE PHASER CAMPAIGN,
he WAS PRACTICALLY HOLDING BENSON'S HAND.
after THE WAY THAT BURNHAM SCREWED HIM OVER, - I'D BE NERVOUS, TOO. MY GOD. - IT WAS AWFUL.
excuse ME.
I NEED TO GET IN HERE SO I CAN CLEAR THE PLATES.
Hey, HONEY, YOU WANT SOME HELP WITH THAT?
I'm GOOD.
looks LIKE WE GOT COMPANY.
Hey, GUYS, ISN'T IT TIME FOR BED?
Oh, THEY NEVER GET TO SEE YOU. LET THEM STAY UP FOR A WHILE.
okay, COME HERE.
come HERE. I WANT YOU TO MEET SOMEONE.
this IS MS. FOSTER.
Hi.
she's AN OLD, OLD FRIEND OF YOUR DADDY'S.
Hey, WHAT YOU GOT THERE?
it's A PICTURE WE PAINTED.
Oh, LET ME HAVE A LOOK AT THAT.
it's ALL OF US WITH MOMMY AND DADDY.
we're REALLY HAPPY.
Oh, THAT IS SO ADORABLE.
when DID YOU DO THIS?
today. MOM TOLD US TO.
I JUST TOLD THEM TO PAINT SOMETHING NICE.
the SENTIMENT'S ALL THEIRS.
but YOU TOLD US TO. - HOLD ON, HONEY.
grownups ARE TALKING.
well, THIS IS REALLY NEAT.
Hey, HOW WOULD YOU BOYS LIKE TO PAINT MY PORTRAIT ONE DAY?
sure. YOU'RE PRETTY.
so LIKE YOUR DAD SAID, IT'S TIME FOR BED.
I'll TAKE THEM BACK UPSTAIRS.
come ON, GUYS.
thank YOU.
I'm GOING TO BEAT YOU. HERE WE GO.
I MUST SAY, LYNETTE,
your HOME IS WARM AND INVITING,
your CHILDREN ARE ABSOLUTELY PRECIOUS
this WHOLE EVENING WAS PRACTICALLY A COMMERCIAL FOR THE PERFECT FAMILY.
you THINK?
you COULDN'T HAVE PLANNED IT ANY BETTER.
and I MEAN THAT.
good.
Hello, SUSAN.
Paul. HI.
I UNDERSTAND YOU AND EDIE WENT SNOOPING THROUGH MY HOUSE.
huh?
it's OKAY. I'M NOT MAD.
so...
what DO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ANGELA?
it WAS MARY ALICE'S BIRTH NAME.
she WAS NAMED AFTER HER AUNT ANGELA.
when SHE WAS A TEENAGER, THEY HAD A FALNG OUT,
so SHE CHANGED HER NAME TO MARY ALICE.
this IS BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED,
so YOU'LL FORGIVE ME IF I'M HAZY ON THE DETAILS.
that's IT?
that's THE EXPLANATION?
ridiculously SIMPLE, ISN'T IT?
she CHANGED HER NAME
because SHE GOT IN A FIGHT WITH HER AUNT?
Paul, THAT JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING MARY ALICE WOULD DO.
neither DID SUICIDE,
but WE BOTH KNOW THAT SHE DID IT.
so CAN WE FINALLY PUT THIS BEHIND US,
or DO YOU NEED TO BREAK INTO MY HOME FOR ANYTHING ELSE?
no. UM...
I'm GOOD. THANKS.
although IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND,
I'd REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT VIDEOTAPE I FOUND
the ONE MARKED "ANGELA.
it'd BE NICE TO SEE MARY ALICE WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG.
I'm AFRAID THAT BOX OF TAPES WAS THROWN OUT WITH THE TRASH.
okay, THEN.
Susan. I'M SERIOUS WHEN I SAY
I HOPE YOU'LL LEAVE MY FAMILY ALONE NOW.
this ENDLESS SUSCION OF YOURS HAS BECOME VERY TIRING.
Yeah, I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.
Oh, THAT'S MY CELL. SORRY.
Oh, GOD, IT'S PETERSON.
excuse ME. - PETERSON?
Hello? YEAH.
so THIS IS QUITE A SHOW YOU PUT ON TONIGHT.
show.
the BOYS' PAINTINGS,
all THOSE REFERENCES TO HOW HAPPY WE ARE.
what's WRONG WITH SUBTLY REMINDING ANNABEL THAT YOU'RE HAPPILY MARRIED?
because IT WASN'T SUBTLE,
and IT'S AN INSULT TO ME.
I DID NOT MEAN IT THAT WAY.
are YOU SO INSECURE THAT YOU HAVE TO PULL THAT CRAP?
keep YOUR VOICE DOWN.
it DOESN'T MATTER IF SHE HAS FEELINGS FOR ME
as LONG I AM NOT INTERESTED.
have I EVER, EVER GIVEN YOU ANY REASON TO DOUBT ME?
anyone IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.
the FIRST TIME WE EVER MET, YOU WERE CHEATG.
with YOU. CHEATING WITH YOU.
it's A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR.
Oh, GIVE ME A BREAK.
well, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
you HIRE YOUR OLD GIRLFRIEND,
and YOU DON'T TELL ME ABOUT IT FOR THREE MONTHS?
I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU FROM DAY ONE,
and YOU WOULD STILL BE JUMPING DOWN MY THROAT.
no, ANNABEL IS ANCIENT HISTORY.
she's IN THE NEXT ROOM.
how LONG DO WE HAVE TO BE MARRIED, LYNETTE?
how LONG UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY TRUST ME?
I TRUST YOU.
how MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SAID TO ME, "IF YOU EVER TOUCH ANOTHER WOMAN, "I WILL TAKE THE BOYS, AND I WI WALK OUT OF HERE,
and YOU WILL NEVER SEE US AGAIN"?
well, THAT'S JUST...
something WIVES SAY TO THEIR HUSBANDS.
not ALL WIVES.
God, LYNETTE, YOU'RE JUST SO CONVINCED THAT I'M GOING TO BE UNFAITHFUL.
it -- IT MAKES ME SICK
the DISTRUST, THE PARANOIA. YOU KNOW
no, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY
until YOU DRIVE ME OUT OF THIS MARRIAGE
just TO PROVE YOURSELF RIGHT.
okay, WAIT. FORGET I SAID THAT.
it's TOO LATE.
you SAID IT.
well, THEN, JUST CONSIDER IT SOMETHING THAT HUSBANDS SAY TO THEIR WIVES.
well, PETERSON'S ON CLOUD NINE.
he DISCOVERED SOME INSIDE SCOOP ON THE METRO ACCOUNT.
the BAD NEWS IS
we're GOING TO HAVE TO REDO THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION.
tonight?
they NEED IT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
peterson SAYS WE MIGHT BE PULLING AN ALL-NIGHTER.
well, I CAN'T DRIVE. I'VE BEEN DRINKING.
I'll DRIVE. COME ON.
Thanks. - DON'T WORRY, LYNTE.
I'll DELIVER HIM BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS I CAN.
please DO.
honey, TAKE OVER FOR ME. I'M GIVING A SPEECH.
just MAKE SURE THEY STAY PINK LIKE THAT, OKAY?
are YOU OKAY?
Oh.
Yeah, I JUST, UH...
realized HOW DISGUSTING MEAT COULD BE.
everyone...
I JUST WANTED TO SAY IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT ALL OF YOU CAME,
and AS YOU KNOW,
in A FEW DAYS,
I WILL BE KING A LITTLE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED VACATION.
lucky FOR ME,
breakfast IS INCLUDED.
Oh, GOD.
the BOTTOM LINE IS
I'm GOING AWAY TO JAIL,
and WHEN A MAN GOES AWAY TO JAIL,
which I HOPE NONE OF YOU HERE EVER HAVE TO DO,
he SEES WHO HIS REAL FRIENDS ARE.
so THANKS.
hear, HEAR.
excuse YOU.
stay PUT UNTIL I NEED YOU.
don't TALK TO ANYBODY,
and FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T GET DRUNK.
you KNOW, I WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO MY COUSIN'S WEDDING TODAY.
it's NOT A WEDDING.
it's A COMMITMENT CEREMONY.
now SIT DOWN AND...
try TO FIT IN.
Ugh.
got YOU A HOT DOG.
no THANKS. I'M FULL.
there's A CROQUET SET.
do YOU WANT TO GO HIT SOME BALLS?
no.
well, THAT'S FINE.
we CAN JUST SIT HERE.
Zach, I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND.
I DON'T WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.
I JUST WANT YOU TO LEAVE ME ALONE, OKAY?
okay.
in THAT MOMENT,
while LOOKING AT THE PILLS THAT HAD BEEN SO OBVIOUSLY TAMPERED WITH,
Gabrielle's NAUSEA WAS SUDDENLY REPLACED BY AN EVEN STRONGER SENSATION
rage.
what ARE YOU DOING?
I'm SO SORRY.
that WAS AN ACCIDENT.
answer MY QUESTION.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS INVITED.
by WHO?
you KNOW WHAT, DR. VAN DE KAMP?
I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO ANSWER TO YOU.
see, I THINK YOU DO.
what IS GOING ON HERE?
he CRASHED THE PARTY.
this GUY CLEARLY IS NOT TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER.
it's OKAY.
george HAS A GIRLFRIEND.
you BROUGHT HER, DIDN'T YOU?
he DOESN'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND. - I DO SO.
she's RIGHT OVER THERE.
that's HIS GIRLFRIEND?
see? WE WERE WORRIED FOR NOTHING.
so ANY TIME YOU WANT TO APOLOGIZE...
Oh, COME ON, REX.
you OWE GEORGE SOME SORT OF GESTURE.
Oh, WHAT THE HELL?
ha HA HA HA HA.
Rex, HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?! - TO BE FAIR,
I ONLY PUSHED HIM.
Carlos, YOU SON OF A BITCH.
I AM PREGNANT, ANIT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!
Wow.
this IS TURNING INTO ONE HELL OF A PARTY.
are YOU OKAY?
I THINK I CAN HONESTLY SAY NO, I'M NOT.
I'm SO SORRY.
Thanks.
but YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT KIDS
that YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HAVING THEM UNTIL YOU DO,
and THEN YOU CAN'T IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT THEM.
it's TRUE.
all I'M SAYING IS MAYBE THIS IS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE.
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE FATHER IS.
what? - YEAH.
so YOU MEAN YOU AND JOHN HAVE STILL BEEN... - YEAH.
Oh, I KNOW, SUSAN, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
Aah!
Oh -- OH, OH, MY GOD!
Oh, MY GOD, THAT'S --THAT'S MY HOUSE!
I'll CALL 911! - YES, THAT'S
that's -- THAT'S MY HOUSE! OH!
Oh, MY -- OH, MY --LOOK, MY KITCHEN!
Oh, IT'S A BIG FIRE!
turns OUT SOMEONE LEFT THE GAS ON WITH CANDLES BURNING.
that's NOT POSSIBLE.
we DON'T BURN CANDLES DURING THE DAY.
uh, WELL, I DID HAVE A-A FRENCH VANILLA CANDLE BURNING EARLIER, BUT -- BUT I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
I-I BLEW IT OUT.
you're ALMOST POSITIVE?
Yes. I DID.
I-I DID, I-I THINK.
look, YOU'RE LUCKY THE FIRE WAS CONTAINED.
the DAMAGE COULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE EXTENSIVE.
you've GOT TO BE MORE CAREFUL FROM NOW ON.
???
Bree, HI. - HI.
you LEFT THE PARTY SO QUICKLY,
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU FOR WHAT REX DID.
Oh, GEORGE, I'M SO SORRY
he HUMILIATED YOU IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOT INTO HIM.
isn't IT OBVIOUS? HE HATES ME.
no, HE DOESN'T HATE YOU.
he DOESN'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
and YOU DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW HIM.
well, I KNOW THIS MUCH
he's NOT GOING TO LET US BE FRIENDS.
well, THAT'S NOT HIS CHOICE TO MAKE.
what IF HE ASKED YOU NOT TO SEE ME ANYMORE?
what IF HE ORDERS YOU NOT TO?
well...
I DECIDE WHO I NEED IN MY LIFE,
and I'VE DECIDED THAT I NEED YOU,
and THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.
he COULD MAKE IT AWFULLY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO SPEND TIME WITH ME.
well...
who SAYS HE HAS TO KNOW HOW I SPEND MY FREE TIME?
I'm HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE FAMILY ACROSS THE STREET.
I THINK ONE OF THEM MAY HAVE SET A FIRE IN MY HOUSE,
and I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT...
I FEEL LIKE IT'S GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY IEND WHO KILLED HERSELF.
I CALLED THE POLICE,
but THEY DIDN'T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.
this FAMILY'S GOT A SECRET -- A BAD SECRET.
I THINK I'M IN OVER MY HEAD.
I NEED YOU TO FIND OUT EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT PAUL YOUNG AND HIS FAMILY.
do YOU THINK YOU CAN HELP ME?
as A MATTER OF FACT...
I KNOW I CAN.
spring COMES EVERY YEAR TO WISTERIA LANE,
but NOT EVERYONE REMEMBERS TO STOP AND SMELL THE FLOWERS.
some ARE TOO BUSY WORRYING ABOUT THE FUTURE...
or MISTAKES THEY'VE MADE IN THE PAST.
others ARE PREOCCUPIED WITH NOT GETTING CAUGHT.
it's A WINDOW.
or THINKING OF WAYS TO CATCH SOMEONE ELSE.
still, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A FEW
who REMEMBER TO TAKE A MOMENT
and APPRECIATE WHAT SPRING HAS GIVEN THEM...
just AS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE
who PREFER TO SIT IN THE DARK
John, YOU'RE A TOY. YOU AND ME -- NO FUTURE.
remember WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO WORK A 60-HOUR WEEK?
you CAN'T TAKE THEM BACK.
you ARE NEVER GOING TO GET SOMEBODY WHO CARES AS MUCH ABOUT FINDING DIERDRE AS I DO.
you SHOT YOURSELF?
pretty LAME, HUH?
the DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE. MOM!
you're NOT TAKING HER AWAY FROM ME.
get OUT.
LYNETTE: I NEEDED YOU TO SEE SOMETHING.
they SAID THEY STOLE IT FROM MIKE'S GARAGE.
is THAT BLOOD?
and LOVE OF COUNTRY.
it WAS ALWAYS A SHOCK WHENEVER SHE WAS CONFRONTED WITH THOSE WHO DIDN'T.
it's NOT MINE.
you PROMISED THE CHEATING HAD STOPPED, REX.
you PROMISED.
could WE NOT YELL AT EACH OTHER?
I'm FEELING REALLY LOUSY TODAY.
I WANT YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE!
Bree, LOOK AT ME.
it's NOT MINE.
well, THEN, WHOSE IS IT?
it JUST DIDN'T MAGICALLY APPEAR IN MY LAUNDRY BASKET.
well, I'M NOT THE ONLY GUY IN THIS HOUSE THAT USES THAT HAMPER.
no.
sorry.
andrew IS STILL A CHILD.
he's 16. IT'S NOT UNHEARD OF.
honey, YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.
and TELL HIM WHAT?
tell HIM THAT WE FOUND HIS CONDOM,
and THAT HE IS FORBIDDEN FROM, YOU KNOW...
I CAN ABSOLUTELY TELL HIM THAT WE THINK HE'S TOO YOUNG,
but I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO DO ANY GOOD.
well, THEN, THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS GO SEARCH HIS ROOM,
and IF WE FIND ANY MORE OF THESE, WE'LL CONFISCATE THEM.
and THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH WHAT?
well, IF WE TAKE AWAY HIS CONDOMS, MAYBE
he's A TEENAGE BOY. WE COULD TAKE AWAY HIS PENIS,
he'd STILL TRY TO HAVE SEX.
well, WE CAN'T PUT IT BACK IN HIS ROOM.
I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE LIKE WE'RE CONDONING HIM HAVING PREMARITAL SEX.
Bree, LET ME PUT THIS ANOTHER WAY.
do YOU WANT TO BECOME A GRANDMOTHER?
Oh, FOR GOD'S SAKE. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
that's THE LAST TIME I DO MY BANKING ONLINE.
of COURSE, EVERY NOW AND THEN, THE DAY ARRIVES
when SOMEONE FINALLY DECIDES TO TELL THE TRUTH.
he WAS SHOT?
how COULD YOU NOT TELL US ABOUT THIS?
he WAS EMBARRASSED. HE SAID IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
Oh, DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.
we KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO TRUST MIKE,
but HE HAD A DEAD WOMAN'S JEWELRY IN HIS GARAGE.
now, DID HE? WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.
all WE KNOW
is THAT LYNETTE'S KIDS TURNED UP WITH IT.
so WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, THAT THE TWINS MURDERED MARTHA?
well, I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST THEM.
I'm SAYING THAT THAT IS ABOUT AS LIKELY
as MIKE HAVING DONE IT.
he's A GOOD GUY. I KNOW HIM.
I MEAN, HE'S -- HE'S MIKE.
honestly, I DON'T THINK MIKE DID IT, EITHER,
but IF WE DON'T CALL,
we're GUILTY OF WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE.
well, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF HE IS INNOCENT,
this SHOULD BE A SIMPLE MATTER TO CLEAR UP.
but WE WILL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT US TO DO.
okay, CALL.
so SHALL I JUST DIAL 911?
well, IT'S NOT REALLY AN EMERGENCY. THERE WAS A MURDER.
well, NOT RECENTLY, AND I PREFER NOT TO TIE UP THE LINE.
will YOU JUST CALL?
Hey.
my MOM WILL BE HOME ANY MINUTE.
she'll FREAK IF SHE SEES YOU HERE.
Oh, I JUST WANTED TO DELIVER THIS PERSONALLY.
I'm HAVING A PARTY.
you KNOW SHE DOESN'T WANT US TO SEE EACH OTHER.
well, YOU GOT TO COME.
I -- YOU'RE THE REASON I'M DOING THIS.
I'll TRY TO TALK TO MY MOM, OKAY?
but YOU REALLY GOT TO GO.
Hey, MRS. SOLIS.
I'm SORRY. DO I KNOW YOU?
Yeah, I'M JUSTIN -- JOHN'S ROOMMATE.
been WAITING FOREVER FOR YOU TO SHOW UP.
Really? WHY?
I WANT TO DO YOU A FAVOR.
what KIND OF FAVOR?
well, JOHN SAYS THAT
you CAN'T EXACTLY AFFORD A GARDENER RIGHT NOW,
and I TOLD HIM I'D BE HAPPY TO DO IT...
for FREE.
you WANT TO MOW MY LAWN FOR FREE.
mow YOUR LAWN, WATER YOUR FLOWERS,
trim YOUR BUSHES.
I COULD DO EVERYTHING JOHN DID FOR YOU.
that's VERY GENEROUS OF YOU, BUT I DON'T THK SO.
Why?
because MY HUSBAND IS HOME QUITE A LOT THESE DAYS.
if ANY BUSH NEEDS TRIMMING, HE TAKES CARE OF IT.
well, THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL YARD.
I'm SURE IT COULD USE A LITTLE EXTRA ATTENTION.
I'm FLATTERED, BUT NO, THANK YOU.
Mrs. SOL, PLEASE.
did I MENTION WHY MY HUSBAND'S HOME A LOT?
he's UNDER HOUSE ARREST.
Oh?
he HAS A LOT OF ANGER TOWARD THE GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW,
and HE'S JUST DYING TO FIND SOMEONE TO TAKE IT OUT ON.
Hey, GUYS?
this ISN'T A HOCKEY RINK. CAN YOU TAKE IT OUTSIDE?
Hi, HONEY. HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
I DIDN'T GET THE V. P. GIG.
Oh, TOM, I AM SO SORRY.
it JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME.
I MEAN, I'M PETERSON'S GO-TO GUY,
the BIGGEST BLOWHARD IN THE OFFICE,
get PROMOTED TO VICE PRESIDENT OVER ME?
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED TIM DUGGAN.
I DO. I JUST...
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST
I REALLY WANTED THAT PROMOTION.
Hey, BOYS, CAN YOU PLEASE TAKE THE STANLEY CUP FINALS OUTSIDE?
well, DID YOU TELL MR. PETERSON THAT YOU WANTED THE JOB?
I HAVE WORKED AT THAT FIRM FOR 8 1/2 YEARS.
duggan's BEEN THERE FOR LESS THAN TWO.
I AM NOT GOING TO BEG.
I'm NOT SAYING TO BEG.
you JUST HAVE TO STEP UP FROM TIME TO TIME.
you HAVE TO SEE YOUR OPPORTUNITY AND TAKE IT.
nobody RESPECTS A SHRINKING VIOLET.
there IS MORE THAN ONE, YOU KNOW, LEADERSHIP STYLE.
mine IS QUIET, BUT EFFECTIVE.
take THAT RACKET OUTSIDE!
well, WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU.
Hey, SEXY. WHERE YOU BEEN?
I CALLED YOU TWICE. YOU AVOIDING ME?
don't BE SILLY. WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
no, I'VE JUST BEEN REALLY BUSY GROCERY SHOPPING.
for TWO DAYS? MUST BE PRETTY WELL STOCKED.
how ABOUT DINNER TONIGHT?
uh...
dinner TONIGHT? UM...
you OKAY?
can YOU HOLD THESE A SEC?
up AGAINST THE CAR!
you HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
anything YOU DO SAY CAN BE USED AGAINST YOU
in A COURT OF LAW.
you HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONSULT AN ATTORNEY.
if YOU CANNOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY,
one WILL BE APPOINTED TO YOU.
so GET THIS
Zach YOUNG'S THROWING A POOL PARTY SATURDAY NIGHT.
sent OUT A BUNCH OF FORMAL INVITATIONS,
complete WITH FANCY LETTERING.
I'm SURPRISED HE DIDN'T SPRITZ THEM WITH AFTER-SHAVE.
what IS WRONG WITH NICE INVITATIONS?
ANDREW: MOM, IT'S A POOL PARTY.
why COULDN'T HE HAVE JUST PASSED OUT FLYERS IN THE QUAD?
cause HE'S GENETICALLY INCAPABLE OF BEING COOL?
so, UH, ARE YOU GOING?
mm, MAYBE.
I MEAN, UM, LISA AND JUSTIN
some OF THE GUYS THOUGHT IT'D BE FUN TO SWIM.
we CAN ALWAYS BAIL
if IT'S AS LAME AS WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE.
Oh, IS, UM, LISA YOUR FRIEND WITH THE PIERCED NAVEL?
Yeah.
you've BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER LATELY,
haven't YOU?
I GUESS.
Oh, UH, ANDREW,
I'm GOING TO WANT YOU HOME BY 11: 00 ON SATURDAY.
11: 00?
mom, IT'S NOT EVEN A SCHOOL NIGHT.
Bree, A CURFEW ISN'T GOING TO DO ANY GOOD.
you MAY BE ABLE TO ABDICATE ALL YOUR PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY,
but I CANNOT.
what -- AT'S GOING ON HERE?
would THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE CONDOM YOU LEFT IN MY ROOM?
as A MATTER OF FACT, IT DOES,
and JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR, IF YOU GET LISA PREGNANT,
you WILL MARRY HER.
Andrew, THIS IS NOT FUNNY.
mom, TRUST ME -- THIS IS VERY FUNNY,
mostly BECAUSE THE CONDOM WASN'T MINE.
you SUCK, YOU KNOW THAT?
so OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED TO TALK.
I'm STILL A VIRGIN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW.
well, GOOD.
but WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU NEED A CONDOM?
because I'M PLANNING ON HAVING SEX,
and I DON'T WANT TO GET PREGNANT.
Danielle, YOU ARE PRESIDENT OF THE ABSTINENCE CLUB.
I WASN'T PLANNING ON RUNNING FOR A SECOND TERM.
John ROWLAND? I THOUGHT YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM.
no, HE BROKE UP WITH ME,
and YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY? BECAUSE I WOULDN'T DO IT.
well, IF THAT'S THE TYPE OF BOY HE IS, THEN GOOD RIDDANCE.
mom, EVERY BOY AT MY SCHOOL IS THAT TYPE OF BOY.
besides...
it's DIFFERENT WITH JOHN.
I LOVE HIM.
Oh, SWEETHEART,
just BECAUSE YOU GIVE A BOY SEX
doesn't MEAN YOU'LL GET LOVE IN RETURN.
so MAYBE I'M BEING STUPID.
what's THE BIG DEAL? IT'S JUST SEX.
honey, I AM LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR HAPPINESS.
now, I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE YOUNG
and FEEL URGES,
but I WAITED UNTIL I GOT MARRIED,
as DID YOUR FATHER, AND IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER.
but DADDY ENDED UP CHEATING ON YOU.
Yes, WELL...
and EVER SINCE HE MOVED BACK IN,
you've BEEN MISERABLE.
why WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
the WALLS BETWEEN OUR BEDROOMS ARE PAPER-THIN.
I HEAR MORE STUFF THAN I PROBABLY SHOULD.
Oh.
look, MOM, I LOVE YOU A LOT,
but YOU REALLY ARE THE LAST PERSON
to EVER GIVE ANYONE ADVICE ABOUT SEX AND HAPPINESS.
have YOU SEEN THESE?
five MORE PAST DUE NOTICES.
don't WORRY. I'M HANDLING IT.
how? HOW ARE YOU HANDLING THIS?
can I PLEASE FINISH MY SANDWICH?
have YOU SEEN OUR CHECKING ACCOUNT LATELY?
we're BROKE.
and THEN WE HAVE THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT COMING UP,
we HAVE PROPERTY TAXES -- GABBY, IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.
no, IT'S NOT. WE ARE SERIOUSLY SCREWED,
and I AM FREAKING OUT THAT YOU'RE NOT FREAKING OUT.
look, THINGS WILL TURN AROUND.
when? I DON'T KNOW WHEN.
but WE'RE LUCKY PEOPLE, AND WE'LL BE LUCKY AGAIN.
what IS THAT?
it's THE LAWNMOWER.
we GOT A NEW GARDENER TODAY.
it's NOT GOING TO COST US A CENT.
the KID'S A FRIEND OF JOHN'S. CARLOS
and HE SAID THAT HE'D DO THE LAWN FOR FREE.
can YOU BELIEVE IT?
we ARE LUCKY PEOPLE.
you GOT IT!
Yeah, DUGGAN!
go, MAN!
all RIGHT! HEY, GUYS, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
Hi.
don't LOOK SO GLUM. YOU'RE GOING TO GET A HIT.
Oh, IT'S NOT THAT.
this IS MY "HATING TIM DUGGAN" LOOK.
Oh! DUGGAN CONNECTS.
look AT THE JOB-STEALING BASTARD RUN.
GGAN IS REALLY SHOWING SOME OF THAT GLORY-HOUNDING,
ass-kissing HUSTLE THAT HE IS SO WELL-KNOWN FOR.
I FORGOT HOW MUCH FUN YOU ARE WHEN YOU'RE BITTER.
Oh, LOOK, HE'S STRETCHING FOR EXTRA BASES,
just LIKE HE STRETCHED FOR EXTRA TERRITORY
screwing OVER UNSUNG UTILITY PLAYER TOM SCAVO.
Ooh! DOWN GOES DUGGAN! DUGGAN GOES DOWN!
that's GOTTA HURT.
well, THE GLORY HOUND IS TAGGED OUT,
and, WELL, HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL
with SOME TOUGH DIRT STAINS, THAT TIM DUGGAN.
Oh, NO, LOOK, I'M SURE HE'S JUST GRANDSTANDING.
Oh, MY GOD.
holy CRAP.
it's ONLY A POOL PARTY. EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE THERE.
I SAID NO.
what ARE YOU GOING TO DO,
keep A BOY-FREE ZONE AROUND ME UNTIL I'M 18?
you CAN SEE BOYS IN A COUPLE YEARS,
just NOT THAT BOY.
why DO YOU HATE ZACH?
I DON'T HATE ZACH.
I JUST THINK HE'S SORT OF CRAZY.
mom, I'VE HEARD PEOPLE CALL YOU SORT OF CRAZY.
well, I'M ADORABLE CRAZY, AND HE'S RAMPAGE CRAZY.
Yeah.
I'm DETECTIVE COPELAND.
I'm INVESTIGATING THE RDER OF MARTHA HUBER.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT MIKE DELFINO.
do YOU REMEMBER SEEING MR. DELFINO ON THE 7th OF LAST MONTH?
is THE 7th IMPORTANT?
well, WE BELIEVE IT WAS THE NIGHT
that MARTHA HUBER WAS MURDERED.
she WAS LAST SEEN
at THE GROCERY STORE AROUND 9: 00,
and THEN SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP
for A DENTIST APPOINTMENT THE NEXT MORNING.
what DAY WAS THAT?
it WAS A SUNDAY.
Oh, MY GOD, YES.
Yes, YES.
Yes, I-I WAS WITH MIKE THAT NIGHT.
you're SURE. YES, I WAS.
Yep, IT WAS A BIG NIGHT FOR US RELATIONSHIP-WISE.
it WAS THE FIRSTIME THAT WE
the FIRST TIME YOU...
did IT.
the FIRST TIME THEY DID IT.
Julie! WELL, IT WAS.
how DID YOU KNOW? I'M NOT CLUELESS.
I FOUND MEN'S BOXERS IN THE CLOTHES HAMPER.
Oh, DON'T WRITE THAT DOWN.
Oh, BUT THIS IS GOOD. YOU CAN LET MIKE GO.
he's INNOCENT.
well, ASSUMING EVERYTHING YOU'RE TELLING ME IS TRUE.
it's TRUE. THE NEXT MORNING,
she MADE PANCAKES IN THE SHAPE OF LITTLE HEARTS.
seriously. LITTLE HEARTS.
Oh, GOD.
Justin, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?
uh, I FINISHED THE HEDGES.
is THERE ANYTHING ELSE MR. SOLIS WANTS DONE?
I DON'T KNOW. HE'S NOT HERE.
he HAD A MEETING WITH HIS LAWYER.
so I GUESS THAT MEANS WE'RE ALL ALONE.
no, THAT MEANS I'M ALL ALONE.
you're LEAVI.
I'm NOT IN A HURRY.
come ON, MAYBE WE COULD HANG OUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
I DON'T THINK SO.
come ON.
if YOU JUST GOT TO KNOW ME, YOU'D SEE I CAN BE LOTS OF FUN.
all MY FRIENDS SAY SO.
well, I'M NOT INTERESTED IN BECOMING ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS.
get OUT OF MY BEDROOM.
come ON, MRS. SOLIS, BE NICE.
you SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
do YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT WOULD BE
for ME TO CALL MY HUSBAND AND TELL HIM
what YOU JUST TRIED TO DO?
not EASY AS IT'LL BE
for ME TO TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND JOHN.
I-I'm SORRY, MRS. SOLIS,
but YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE NICE TO ME...
at LEAST ONCE.
are YOU OKAY?
uh, YEAH, YEAH. I'M A LITTLE BIT EMBARRASSED.
I MUST BE THE TALK OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
no. NOT REALLY, NO.
so GUESS WHAT
I'm YOUR ALIBI.
I TOLD THE POLICE THAT WE WERE...
together THE NIGHT THAT MRS. HUBER WAS KILLED
and THAT I COULD NEVER FORGET THAT NIGHT.
so YOU DON'T THINK I KILLED MRS. HUBER.
no. NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I COULD NEVER THINK YOU KILLED ANYBODY,
even IF I WASN'T YOUR ALIBI, WHICH I AM.
okay, I'M, UM...
I'm GOING TO GO TAKE A SHOWER.
jail's KIND OF GROSS.
I'll CALL YOU LATER, OKAY?
sure. WHEN?
later.
all RIGHT, I'VE JUST GOT SOME STUFF
I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF, OKAY?
okay.
Mrs. VAN DE KAMP.
Hello, JOHN.
I'm SORRY TO DROP BY ON YOU UNANNOUNCED.
do YOU HAVE A MOMENT?
sure.
so...
what CAN I DO FOR YOU?
well, I'LL TELL YOU.
my DAUGHTER IS PLANNING ON GIVING YOU HER VIRGINITY,
and I WOULD CONSIDER IT A PERSONAL FAVOR
if YOU WOULDN'T TAKE IT.
Hey. HEY.
so WHAT'S THE WORD ON TIM?
he CAME THROUGH THE TRIPLE BYPASS
with FLYING COLORS.
Ah, THANK GOD.
of COURSE, IT'S NOT ALL COMING UP ROSES.
he's NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK TO WORK FOR...4, 4 1/2 MONTHS.
Oh.
what?
the COMPANY STILL NEEDS TO EXPAND, SO I FIGURE,
they NEED A FIT, HEART-SMART GUY LIKE ME
to STEP UP, TAKE THE BALL.
you're GOING AFTER TIM DUGGAN'S PROMOTION?
no. I ALREADY GOT IT.
you SHLD HAVE SEEN ME.
I WALKED STRAIGHT INTO PETERSON'S OFFICE,
and I TOLD HIM
that HE WOULD BE A FOOL TO HOLD DUGGAN'S PROMOTION.
you CALLED YOUR BOSS A FOOL?
I DID.
that WAS RISKY IN RETROSPECT,
but YOU KNOW WHAT? STILL, HE GAVE ME THE JOB.
Oh, MY GOD! THAT'S GREAT.
honey, IT'S ME.
I'm THE MAN, I'VE GOT THE WHOLE WEST COAST
Oh, MY -- WHAT?
what? THE WHOLE WEST COAST?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING AFTER AN IN-HOUSE POSITION.
no, NO, NO. I'M SETTING UP NEW OFFICES FROM SEATTLE TO L. A.
I-I TOLD YOU THAT.
no.
no, YOU DIDN'T.
okay.
well, SO IT'S GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE TRAVEL, BUT
more TRAVEL?
Tom, YOU'RE BARELY HERE HALF THE TIME AS IT IS,
and NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE, WHAT, TWICE THE WORKLOAD?
honey, PLEASE, DON'T RUIN THIS.
I'm SORRY, BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED WITH ME.
I DID. YOU TOLD ME TO STOP BEING A SHRINKING VIOLET
and TO STEP UP.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN IN-HOUSE POSITION.
okay, I'M GOING TO GO SHOWER.
look, WAIT, WAIT.
I KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU.
no, YOU DON'T.
no, YOU DON'T. I AM 41 YEARS OLD.
if I DON'T MAKE VICE PRESIDENT NOW,
it's NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.
this IS MY CAREER. IT'S -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.
so WAS MINE, BUT I'M HERE, AREN'T I?
I'm GOING TO TAKE THE JOB.
she SAID THAT YOU BROKE UP WITH HER
because SHE REFUSED TO HAVE SEX.
Wow. UM...
okay, HERE'S THE DEAL
I SAID THAT, BUT IT WAS JUST AN EXCUSE.
I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS...
I WASN'T THAT INTO HER.
Really?
and SHE WAS ALWAYS SO PROUD OF NEVER HAVING DONE IT,
I FIGURED, HEY, THIS IS MY WAY OUT.
well, SHE FEELS VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT YOU.
well, DON'T GEME WRONG. SHE'S NICE.
the TRUTH IS...
there's SOMEONE ELSE.
Oh.
are YOU GOING STEADY?
not EXACTLY.
we WERE SEEING EACH OTHER PRETTY REGULARLY,
but THIS OTHER LADY -- GIRL
she SORT OF DUMPED ME.
Oh, I SEE.
well, LOOK, I'LL TALK TO DANIELLE,
and DON'T WORRY
I'll LET HER DOWN GENTLY.
um, ACTUALLY, I WOULD PREFER IF YOU DIDN'T.
huh?
I KNOW MY DAUGHTER. SHE'S VERY DETERMINED,
and UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY FIRM WITH HER,
she's GOING TO CONTINUE TO THINK THAT THERE'S HOPE.
okay. I'LL BE FIRM.
better STILL...
be BRUTAL.
decided TO INDULGE YOUR SWEET TOOTH, HUH?
I'll BE DEAD INSIDE A YEAR.
I GOT BIGGER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT THAN MY WAISTLINE.
so...
who's THE WOMAN THEY THINK YOU KILLED?
Martha HUBER, LOCAL BUSYBODY.
I THOUGHT HER MURDER WAS RANDOM.
nothing RANDOM ABOUT HER JEWELRY ENDING UP IN YOUR GARAGE.
did YOU KILL HER?
no.
whoever SET ME UP DID A GOOD JOB, THOUGH.
the COPS ARE ALL OVER ME.
you're GETTING CLOSE TO SOMETHING.
well, IF I AM CLOSE, I DON'T SEE IT.
what I'M SAYING IS PEOPLE LEAVE TRAILS.
one OF THOSE TRAILS WILL LEAD TO DIERDRE.
whoever SET YOU UP MUST KNOW THAT.
Yeah. WELL, MAYBE.
but I WON'T BE MUCH GOOD TO YOU LOCKED UP.
I'm RICH, MIKE.
one OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT BEING RICH
is THE SECURITY OF KNOWING YOU CAN BUY YOUR WAY OUT OF ANY PROBLEM.
I'm NOT TAKING MY MONEY TO THE GRAVE.
I'm GOING TO USE IT TO SAVE YOUR ASS.
Mrs. SOLIS.
Hello, JUSTIN.
Hey. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I AM HERE TO TALK TO YOUR ROOMMATE.
I-I DIDN'T THINK YOU GUYS TALKED ANYMORE.
well, NOW WE HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT
you.
me.
Yes. I'M GOING TO TELL HIM HOW YOU'RE TRYING
to BLACKMAIL ME INTO SLEEPING WITH YOU.
I WONDER HOW HE'LL REACT.
Mrs. SOLIS
you CAN'T TALK TO JOHN ABOUT THAT.
Oh, I CAN,
and I WILL, YOU LITTLE WORTHLESS PIECE OF CRAP.
listen, MRS. SOLIS, I'M SORRY.
I'm SORRY. I DIDN'T WANT TO BLACKMAIL YOU.
then WHY DID YOU?
I REALLY NEEDED TO SLEEP WITH YOU.
Why?
because...
I THINK I MIGHT BE GAY.
Oh.
daddy! DADDY! DADDY!
Hey!
dad! DADDY!
dad!
how YOU DOING, GUYS? WHAT'S UP?
Oh, WE WENT OUT FOR BURGERS,
and THE BOYS KNEW YOU WOULDN'T BE HOME TILL AFTER, UM, BEDTIME,
and SO WE DECIDED TO POP IN AND VISIT THE NEW V. P.
Yeah, WELL, CHECK IT OUT.
I FINALLY GOT AN OFFICE WITH A WINDOW.
Yeah, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WINDOW.
Hey, GUYS.
Hey, WHO WANTS CHAIR RIDES?
me! ! me!
come ON, OUT THIS WAY. HERE WE GO.
here WE GO, GUYS. READY?
Yeah, DADDY!
now HOLD ON! TRY TO HOLD ON!
checking OUT THE NEW EXECUTIVE DIGS?
Oh.
you KNOW IT.
can I TELL YOU A LITTLE SECRET?
sure.
Dan WANTED TO HOLD THE PROMOTION OVER FOR TIM DUGGAN.
and I'M THE ONE THAT CONVINCED HIM
to GIVIT TO TOM.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Tom IS SUCH A WORKHORSE,
and HE WANTED IT SO BADLY.
Yeah, HE CERTAINLY DID.
what IS WRONG? AREN'T YOU HAPPY ABOUT THIS PROMOTION?
well, IT'S GREAT, OBVIOUSLY.
thank YOU.
of COURSE,
I MEAN, I WILL MISS HIM,
being GONE ALL THE TIME.
he'll BE BRINGING IN MORE MONEY,
but HE IS GOING TO MISS THE BIRTHDAYS,
baseball GAMES,
first STEPS...
but THAT'S THE TRADE-OFF.
right?
I JUST HOPE ONE DAY,
Tom DOESN'T LOOK BACK AND REGRET BEING GONE SO MUCH.
well, I BETTER GET OUT THERE BEFORE THEY BREAK SOMETHING.
of COURSE. I WILL SEE YOU SOON.
so HAVE YOU BEEN ACTING ON THESE FEELINGS?
I GOT A BUDDY. WE GET TOGETHER,
we MESS AROUND.
but IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
it's JUST LATELY, I'VE BEEN STARTING TO, LIKE,
care ABOUT HIM, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT.
Wow.
Yeah, AND I THOUGHT IF I SLEEP WITH SOMEBODY LIKE YOU,
I'll KNOW FOR SURE,
and I CAN STOP FREAKING OUT ABOUT THIS.
Yeah, BUT WHY ME? YOU'RE A GOOD-LOOKING KID.
why DON'T YOU TEST-DRIVE SOMEONE YOUR OWN AGE?
girls TALK.
if I START SOMETHING WITH SOMEBODY
and IT DOESN'T...
work OUT,
everybody AT SCHOOL WILL FIND OUT.
and I FIGURED I COULD TRUST YOU, 'CAUSE YOU HAVE A HUSBAND AND ALL.
well, I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE, IN A...
weird SORT OF WAY.
you KNOW, MY BUDDY AND I, WE'VE BEEN MESSING AROUND
for QUITE A WHILE, AND...
this WHOLE TIME, I JUST KEPT TELLING MYSELF
that IT DIDN'T REALLY MEAN ANYTHING, YOU KNOW?
I GUESS I'VE JUST BEEN KIDDING MYSELF, HUH?
we're ALL IN DENIAL ABOUT SOMETHING.
but YOU'RE FINALLY FACING THE TRUTH,
and I THINK THAT'S SORT OF BRAVE.
Thanks.
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO.
uh, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I NEVER WOULD HAVE TOLD MR. SOLIS ABOUT YOU AND JOHN.
I MAY BE GAY, BUT I'M NOT A JERK.
did YOU FEEL ANYTHING?
not REALLY.
you're DEFINITELY GAY.
Hi.
Hi. I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU AT NIGHT, MS. MAYER,
but I WAS HOPING THAT MAYBE YOU COULD
come DOWN TO THE STATION WITH ME,
just ANSWER A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.
now? WELL, I-I'M SORRY.
my -- MY DAUGHTER AND I WERE GOING TO GO SEE A MOVIE TONIGHT.
mom...
we CAN DO IT ANOTHER NIGHT. I'LL BE FINE.
uh...
let ME GET MY PURSE. GREAT.
are YOU SURE?
Yeah.
well, I'M SURE I WON'T BE LATE.
okay. BYE.
Bye.
you SAID THAT MIKE CAME TO YOUR HOUSE AROUND 10: 00 P. M. ON THE NIGHT OF THE 7th.
um...
am I SUPPOSED TO TALK INTO THE CAMERA OR...
no, NO. JUST -- JUST TALK TO ME.
okay. UH, YES.
he CAME OVER AROUND 10: 00.
do YOU KNOW OF ANY TENSION BETWEEN MIKE AND MARTHA HUBER?
no.
were YOU AWARE THAT MIKE WAS SHOT RECENTLY?
Yes.
on VALENTINE'S DAY.
and DO YOU KNOW HOW THAT CAME ABOUT?
he DROPPED HIS GUN CLEANING IT.
ms. MAYER, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I've BEEN WORKING AROUND GUNS FOR YEARS.
I've NEVER SEEN ONE DISCHARGE WHEN IT HITS THE GROUND.
someone HAS TO PULL THE TRIGGER.
well, I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
were YOU AWARE THERE WAS A HOME INVASION
three BLOCKS FROM YOU ON PINE AVENUE
day BEFORE VALENTINE'S? NO.
the INTRUDER WAS SHOT IN THE STOMACH.
where WAS MIKE'S WOUND?
the STOMACH.
do YOU LOVE HIM?
what?
what DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH
it's JUST THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO STUPID THINGS
when THEY'RE IN LOVE.
I SHOULD KNOW. I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOUR TIMES.
tell ME THE TRUTH.
he WASN'T WITH YOU THAT NIGHT, WAS HE?
he ASKED YOU TO LIE FOR HIM, DIDN'T HE?
no, HE DIDN'T. HE WAS WITH ME,
and MIKE WOULDN'T KILL ANYBODY. I'M SURE OF THAT.
convicted 1987,
did 5 1/2 YEARS FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING
and MANSLAUGHTER.
you WANT A COFFEE? I'M GOING TO GO FOR COFFEE.
so IS SHE COVERING FOR HER GUY?
Nah, SHE'S JUST A SUCKER.
I GUESS NO ONE'S IN THE POOL YET.

Yeah. WE SHOULD TALK.

alert THE MEDIA.
but I DON'T CARE. YOU'RE HERE NOW.
this IS GOING TO BE GREAT.
come ON, MAN. LET'S GO.

I KNOW WHERE MY MOM KEPT HER GUN.
that's NOT FUNNY, ZACH.
well, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, YEAH, IT KIND OF IS.
Hey, DANIELLE.
are YOU OKAY?
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.
can WE GO?
sure.
I'm TAKING DANIELLE HOME.
are YOU COMING BACK?
I DON'T THINK SO.
Oh.
so HOW WAS THE PTA MEETING?
long. HA HA.
so PETERSON CALLED ME INTO HIS OFFICE TODAY.
Really?
Yeah, HE, UH...
he CHANGED HIS MIND. HE'S GOING TO...
hold THAT PROMOTION FOR DUGGAN.
Oh.
Yeah, IT'S -- IT'S -- IT'S FINE.
you KNOW, I'M GLAD, REALLY.
I DIDN'T WANT TO WORK ALL THOSE LONG HOURS,
and YOU KNOW HOW I HATE FLYING.
it JUST DOES, YOU KNOW, HORRIBLE THINGS TO MY BACK,
and, GOD, WITH ALL THAT EXTRA STRESS,
I WOULD HAVE ENDED UP EXACTLY LIKE TIM DUGGAN 10 YEARS FROM NOW, SO...
Yeah, OF COURSE.
so IT'S -- IT'S OVER.
look, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE VICE PRESIDENT
one OF THESE DAYS.
you KNOW WHAT? IT'S OKAY, HONEST.
I AM, UH...
I'm REALLY GLAD THAT IT WORKED OUT THIS WAY.
Oh, GOD, YOU SCARED ME.
how'd IT GO?
went JUST PEACHY.
and HUMILIATING AND SHOCKING.
how COULD YOU?
God -- "SUSAN, DO YOU TRUST ME?
Yes, OF COURSE I DO." OH, I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.
and YOU'RE SUCH A LIAR.
Oh, AND APPARENTLY, A KILLER AND A DRUG DEALER.
that's JUST QUITE A PERSONAL AD YOU'VE GOT GOING THERE.
Susan, I CAME TO WISTERIA LANE
stop! STOP, MIKE! JUST STOP.
if YOU KEEP TALKING,
you're GOING TO WORK YOUR WAY INTO MY HEART,
and I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
anywhere NEAR MY HEART...
ever.
mommy NEEDS A HUG.

I DON'T KNOW. IT'S PRETTY DEAD IN THERE.
Oh, JULIE, ZACH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
you CAN'T HOLD YOUR BREATH FOREVER!
Oh!
Oh, YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST STAY UNDER THERE
and NEVER COME UP FOR AIR, 'CAUSE WHEN YOU DO,
I'm GOING TO CHOKE THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF YOU!
is MY DAUGHTER UNDER THERE?
I'm NOT -- I'M NOT GAY.
I -- OKAY.
I'm -- I'M SORRY.
I'll JUST
I'm JUST GOING TO LEAVE THOSE RIGHT THERE.
Oh! I'M FINE.
it's GOOD. YOU JUST -- YOU KNOW
did -- DID YOU SEE -- NO. GOODBYE.
sell THE HOUSE. ARE YOU CRAZY?
Carlos, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE ANYMORE.
but IF OUR LAWYER GETS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
to UNFREEZE THE BANK ACCOUNTS, THEN
then WHAT? HUH? FINISH THE SENTENCE, CARLOS.
we HAVE TONS OF LEGAL BILLS, YOU'VE LOST ALL YOUR CLIENTS,
and EVEN WITH OUR SAVINGS, WE'RE SCREWED.
but
it's OUR HOUSE.
honey, I KNOW.
I LOVE THIS PLACE, TOO.
I JUST -- I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO FACE THE MUSIC.
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE POOR AT THIS STAGE OF MY LIFE.
you KNOW, CARLOS,
I've BEEN BROKE A LOT OF TIMES IN MY LIFE,
but I'VE NEVER BEEN POOR,
because POOR IS JUST A STATE OF MIND.
and RIGHT NOW,
you AND I ARE JUST...
without FUNDS?
exactly.
[ sighs ] I GUESS WE COULD GET AN APARTMENT,
start OVER.
who KNOWS?
it MIGHT EVEN BE FUN.
and ONCE WE'RE BACK ON OUR FEET...
we'll GET A HOUSE AS BIG AS THIS ONE.
bigger.
so I GET MY WIFE THIS DOG FOR HER BIRTHDAY.
a STRAY FROM THE POUND.
cheapest GIFT I'VE EVER GOTTEN HER,
and SHE LOVES IT, SO I'M A GENIUS, RIGHT?
then I FIND OUT IT'S GOT THIS WEIRD BLOOD DISEASE.
now I'M LAYING OUT $600 A MONTH FOR DOGGIE MEDICINE
for THIS MUTT, AND I'M A GENIUS, RIGHT?
Aw, DON'T BE CYNICAL. YOU DID SOMETHING NICE,
made YOUR WIFE HAPPY.
now...
let's TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.
did you leave the door open? Call the police!
is that the guy who broke into your house?
arrests were made...
Yeah, that's him.
I just want a chance
I don't want to know you.
fathers were confronted...
who's sister mary bernard?
you do not want to start a war with me.
bring it on.
boundaries were drawn...
Mr. Williams was responsible for your husband's death.
and everyone learned that sometimes justice is served...
we need to call an ambulance.
without sang a word.
there were many ways to tell bree van de kamp was a lady.
thank you very much.
she was courteous to those around her, she moved with elegance and grace and she was very careful to never let others know what she was thinking.
Mrs. Van de kamp, thank you for coming on such short notice.
so what's happened?
have you had any luck finding george?
you see, like most well-bred women...
george is dead.
he committed suicide last night at a hotel.
Bree had something to hide.
Oh, um...
well, um, it was very good of you to tell me in person, truly.
actually, uh, there's more.
more?
do you recognize this?
those are my panties. How did you...
we assume mr. Williams stole them.
where did you find them?
Mr. Williams had a room filled with, um... unsavory items.
it was like a shrine.
unsavory items"? Well, what does that mean?
you don't want to know.
just so you're aware, the "daily tribune
the editor's a good friend of mine.
I'm pretty sure i can quash it, but you might want to tell your family what's going on, just in case.
what is that?
I am so sorry. You weren't supposed to see that.
Mudge, get that out of here.
no, wait! Is that supposed to be me?
well...
I don't understand.
I mean, what would george be doing with a life-size doll?
Oh, dear lord.
go ahead.
Oh, hold it. What are you gonna do with that?
well, until we close the file on mr. Williams, she's considered evidence.
we'll have to take her back to the station.
I am so sorry about this, mrs. Van de kamp.
I know how difficult all this must be.
don't you worry about me, detective barton.
I will be just fine.
Yes, there were many ways to tell that bree was a lady, but the surest was to watch how she maintained her dignity in even the most undignified of situations.
it's a story as old as time itself...
the return of the prodigal son.
and no matter how many times it's repeated...
Hi, dad.
Susan mayer told me she gave you some money to go to utah.
Yeah, i had no idea where to look for you, though, and the money started to run out, so i thought that maybe you'd come back here.
you're a smart kid.
can i ask you something?
of course. Anything.
well, when you left town, mrs. Tillman said that my real mother was a junkie from utah.
that's right.
so...
I don't know. It could have been anyone.
thanks for the faucet. This leak is driving me crazy.
what do i owe you?
Oh, it's no rush. Just pay me when i install it.
Hey, there!
have you seen today's paper?
no, not yet.
Ohh. There's a follow-up on that guy you caught last week.
police seek help in identifying mystery vagrant.
they don't know the man's name yet?
they're not even sure that he knows how talk.
think they're going to hold him in the psych ward until they figure out who he is.
well, i will certainly rest easier knowing that he's not roaming around our neighborhood.
see you!
thanks again for the faucet.
sure.
what are we gonna do about caleb?
obviously, we are going to go and get him.
where are my cuffs?
bottom drawer. Ah.
so when do i tell people you'll be back?
couple, maybe three days.
what the hell's this?
it's the ball gag. I thought you wanted it.
we do not recycle ball gags.
take a look at t teeth marks.
it's gross.
I'd like to think that we're better th that.
Hey, monroe?
you sure you don't want any help?
the guy's dangerous.
he's a half-wit, jerry.
if i can handle you, i can handle him.
so he poisoned rex?
well, it turns out he wasn't so sweet after all.
anyway, there's a chance that some of this may wind up in the paper, so i wanted you to hear it from me first.
Bree, i'm so sorry.
Yeah, like you haven't been through enough.
God, and he's our pharmacist.
it's enough to turn you holistic.
I know this sounds awful, but i'm kind of glad the guy's dead.
Oh, i hope that little creep suffered.
well, we'll never know.
that's andrew back from camp hennessey. I've got to go.
does he know yet?
he hasn't got a clue.
how do you think he's gonna react?
all right, what the hell is going on?
I know you didn't take me out of kid jail for my health.
I'll get back to you later.
so are the police sure?
Yeah. They found data in george's personal computer and also records at his pharmacy that pretty much proves that he was poisoning your father.
did they say why he killed him?
well, the detective seems to think he was trying to get your father out of the way so...
honey, please use your coaster.
that's gonna leave a ring.
my father was murdered because of you, so as far as i'm concerned, you no longer get to tell me what to do.
Andrew, that is not fair.
you brought that psycho into our house!
you sat him down at our table.
just how fair do you expect me to be?
Andrew, george williams fooled a lot of people.
Yeah, well, he didn't fool me.
Andrew, i'm not trying to minimize my part in this.
believe me, i hate myself for what's happened.
good. Now we have something in common.
Oh, by the way, i'm gonna call my friend justin and have him come over and spend the night tonight.
Justin? Is he a friend of yours from school or church?
what kind of friend is he?
the real good kind.
Andrew, it is inappropriate r you to have somebody over.
you just got home.
like i said, you don't get to tell me what to do anymore.
you came.
did i have a choice?
well, sure.
because at the hospital, you sounded like you were fully prepared to blackmail me into having some kind of a relationship with you.
that was just the heat of the moment, and once you geto know me, you'll understand that i am not the kind of person who could ever, ever resort to blackmail.
well, i wish you'd made that clear in the hospital.
could have saved me a trip.
so are you coming in?
well, i got a lunch hour to kill.
that was my first halloween. I was 2. what do you think i am?
I don't know.
Oh, come on, just guess. You can tell.
uh, a holess person?
no, addison, i'm a chicken.
see? Those are feathers hanging arou.
Oh. I thought that was supposed to be trash.
uh, look, are we done here?
you haven't even finished your coffee.
I got to get back to work.
Oh, well, we... we haven't even finished the high school years.
I wanted to show you this one.
this was from the father-daughter dance.
I had to take my mother's hairstylist.
what do you want from me, susan?
well, l-i just want to share more than our d. n.a.
I... i wanted to have a relationship with you.
none of this means anything to you?
I'll take the hobo picture.
actually, it was... fine.
what's this?
our company insurance policy. You ever bother to read it?
I'm going to say no, but don't tell.
we have day care, ed, day care.
do you realize that since we fired half the staff, you and i have barely left the building?
my kids are forgetting who i am.
I hear you. I have 17-month-old who i haven't actually seen awake in weeks.
see? All we need is a minimum participation of... 16 kids.
my kids, your baby, sally in accounting has three, that new guy in human resources has two and we hit the mother lode with the mormon reptionist.
she just popped out number 6. There. 16.
15. my wife won't do it.
well, maybe if i tald to her.
no, i'm telling you, this day care thing is a non-starter.
fran won't even let anyone else hold the baby.
well, she won't just take some time off for a couple of hours?
Lynette, if i hadn't cut that umbilical cord i swear they would still be attached.
but if you want to try...
more power to you.
you! What the hell did you do with my husband?!
please restrain yourself, gabrielle.
you're in a house of god.
tell me where he is!
everywhere, of course.
not god, my husband.
Gaby, what are you doing here?
I was just about to ask you the same thing.
you were supposed to meet me at the spa.
I was just helping sister mary with the mailings for the fund-raiser.
the church is about to send a relief team to botswana to help with the drought.
that's your excuse?
we missed side-by-side water massages.
I had to book them weeks in advance.
okay, you missed a massage.
it's unfortunate, but there are people dying in botswana.
there are going to be people dying in this church if you don't wipe that patronizing look off your face!
what is your problem?
sister mary, will you excuse us, please?
certainly.
we are supposed to be working on our marriage, carlos, but we can't do that as long as our lady of perpetual stick-up-her-butt has you worrying about thirsty orphans.
you're blaming sister mary for the tension in our marriage?
she wants us fighting.
she wants you to get tired of me and walk out so she can have you all to herself.
that's crazy. She's a nun.
she may wear a habit and the beads, but at the end of the day, she is still a woman, just like me, and i know what i'm capable of.
she is a woman...
but she is nothing like you.
Carlos, where are you going?
you look tense, gabrielle.
perhaps you should think about getting a massage.
Hi, susan, it's addison. Are you there?
Hi. Hi, yeah, i'm here.
good. You're home.
Uh-huh. What's up?
you know you were saying you wanted to be part of my life?
Yeah.
I'at the police station.
I need you to come bail me out.
solicitation? You were arrested for solicitation?
it was entrapment. I'm the victim here.
but you were with a prostitute.
apparently not.
I asked her three times... "are you a cop?
they got to tell you, but she didn't say "boo.
I thought this was america!
Addison, you just got caught paying for sex.
now is not the time to wrap yourself in the flag.
don't give me that look. It wasn't my fault. I'm sorry.
how is trying to pick up a hooker not your fault?
I was at the store, i was working on my computer and then, you know, they have these ads?
they pop up on the screen and they ask if you want to have a hot date.
well, it gets a fellow worked up.
can't you just go home and have sex with your wife like a normal person?
she's a 68-year-old woman.
that bell stopped ringing for me years ago.
Oh, my god. Stop. Right now.
I'm gonna go pay this thing.
so am i off the hook now?
what?
th whole father-dghter thing, we're done, right?
thursday, coffee at 2. Be on time.
don't take this the wrong way, but are you dim?
okay, i didn't exactly love what i found out about you today, but the goal was to learn, not to judge.
I bring the coffee.
that crap you made burnt a hole in my stomach.
this is tunde.
he losboth his parents to this drought.
in fact, water is always scarce in botswana.
the national currency is called the pula or raindrop...
Hello, gabrielle. What brings you here?
I'm concerned about the drought in kenya.
botswana.
Yeah, and you?
well, i'm organizing this relief trip.
we leave in a week.
well, bon voyage, father.
I'm not going myself.
we had to scale back our relief efforts this year.
we even had to cut a few of the aid workers from the trip.
sister mary, sister greta were so disappointed.
if you just want to hand some of...
sister mary was going on the trip?
well, sister mary always goes for at least a few months, but when our funding came up short, she graciously offered to step aside, said there's plenty of god's work to do here.
thank you, carlos. Appreciate it.
I bet she did.
how much cash are you short, father?
we plan to set up a modern system of irrigation.
I'm sorry to interrupt, sister mary, but i have an announcement.
I have just received a donation of $8, 000, which means that sister mary and sister greta will be able to join our relief trip to botswana.
it just goes to show angels are everywhere.
Hey. I'm here to see lynette scavo.
Oh, hi. Excuse me. Hi.
I'm lynette. You must be fran.
Hi. Ed said you needed to talk to me.
I couldn't imagine about what.
Oh, well, come on in my office.
you want me to put my daughter in day care?
but i'm a stay-at-home mom.
I'm not suggesting that you sign her up for all day.
maybe just a couple of hours in the afternoon.
wouldn't that be great?
have some time to yourself, relax, unwind?
I don't need to unwind. I love taking care of little mindy.
Oh, of course, of course, but we all have days when we're starting to lose it.
wouldn't it be nice to have someplace to take her before you want to strangle her?
I cherish every moment i spend with her, truly.
Really?
Yeah. Look, i'm gonna level with you.
Parcher and murphy can't have a day care center unless we have at least 16 kids and without little mindy, we only have 15.
well, th's not my problem.
okay. Okay. I just thought i'd give it a shot.
well, i wish i could help you, but i can't.
okay.
Lynette, can i ask you something?
Yeah.
why did you have kids if you weren't gonna raise them?
excuse me?
well, i just don't understand women who say they want to bmothers, but then hand their kids over to glorified babysitters.
I work because my family needs me to.
Oh, dear, i've upset you, and that wasn't my intention.
I bet.
make no mistake, i'm a good mother.
that's the difference between us...
I couldn't settle for being a good mother.
I want to be a great one.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh, hi, alberta. How are you?
were you the one that sent out those neighborhood watch pamphlets?
I was wondering if maybe you had any extra copies.
or i'll just borrow one from somebody else. Thanks.
Yep, looks like carol's penmanship.
this is ridiculous. What does she think, we're having an affair?
well, she probably saw you drop me off yesterday, and she assumed the worst.
well, now you're gonna have to tell her the truth.
Oh, no, no, no. I'd catch holy hell.
Oh, so you want me to catch it for you?
I mean, you, youelf said she's crazy.
I don't want to wake up tomorrow morning and find my tires slashed.
all right. I'll talk to her.
Hello, edie. Do you have something you'd like to say?
no. That pretty much says it all.
sister mary, what a lovely surprise.
well, i couldn't leave without saying good-bye, gabrielle.
Oh, that's so sweet. I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm sure not half as much as you're gonna miss your husband. Huh?
don't freak out. I'm going to botswana.
What?! Sister mary needs a companion.
what happened to sister greta?!
I was gonna go with sister greta, but the region is so volatile, i decided i'd feel much safer with a male companion.
Carlos, you can't do this.
you can't just go to africa.
honey, i'm only gonna be gone for two months.
this journey is important for me.
I want to be one of god's soldiers.
and you will be one, carlos.
after you see the devastation over there, you're never the same.
you see how selfish your old life is and you just want to get rid of everything
Oh, gosh. I should get going and start packing.
we leave in less than a week.
I should probably send a thank you letter to my parole officer.
he's being a real mensch about this.
I may be a catholic, but i am so not above slapping a nun.
go ahead.
do it.
just make sure you hit hard enough to leave a mark.
Yeah. I didn't think so.
kiss the kids good night and i'll see them in the morning. Okay, yeah.
I love you, too. Bye-bye.
I'm sorry about the day care thing, lynette, but fran hardly ever lets me hold the kid.
you know, since day one, all i ever got was, "support the head, support the head.
I think i know how to support a damn baby head.
Ohh, let's just... let's just do this.
I don't want to be here all night.
you're mindy's father.
you have a right to spend time with her.
I know, but what can i do?
you could stand up to fran.
if you don't, you'll just become more resentful, she'll get nuttier.
and without a father figure, poor mindy will grow up to be stripper.
a stripper?
there's science to back thatp.
you know what?
you go ahead and push the button on this day care thing, lynette, and count mindy in.
Yeah, i'll handle fran.
you're doing the right thing, ed, for little mindy.
Yeah.
dude, what if your mom walks in?
she won't.
you don't know that.
just wait till everybody's asleep.
seriously.
I'll make it worth your while.
you better.
I wish she would walk in on us, just to see the expression on her face.
God, i hate her so much.
still, though, she's your mother.
don't you sort of have to love her?
last year, when she found out that i like guys, she freaked out.
she said that if i didn't change, i'd be going straight to hell, so since i knew that i couldn't change, it suddenly hit me that one day, my own mother was gonna stop loving me, so i decided to stop loving her first.
that way, it wouldn't hurt so bad.
she didn't know what she was saying.
Yes, she did, so now she's got to be punished.
how are you gonna punish her?
one day, she'll slip up, and i'll have something against her and when that happens, i'm gonna take her down so hard, she'll never get back up.
it may take you awhile to get something on her.
that's okay.
I don't mind waiting for the things that i want.
Lynette, hey, hey. Look who's here.
Hey! You know, the day care room won't be ready until next week at the earliest.
if i had waited, i might have lost my nerve.
I had a window.
fran was in the shower, so i just grabbed the baby and ran.
you took the baby without telling fran?
I refuse to be bullied by that woman. You were right.
Mindy is my daughter, i wanted to spend time with her.
I have that right.
um, ed, the lobby just called and your wife's on her way up and she seems pretty angry.
Oh, man.
here. Hold mindy. Oh.
let me handle this.
Oh, i was planning to.
I thought mindy had been kidnapped!
I left a sticky note.
I wasn't looking for a sticky note, ed!
I was looking for my missing child!
she's my child, too, and she's staying here, just a few hours a day.
you, give her to me.
no, i made a decision.
yeah? Okay, watch me make a decision.
I'm done with this marriage. I'm taking my baby and i'm getting on a plane to pittsburgh.
you wouldn't dare!
you think you miss mindy now, wait till we're living with my mother!
I'll fight you on this. Yeah? Try...
as lynette saw her dreams of day care about to board a plane to pittsburgh, a baby needs her mother! You're crazy, you know that?!
Yeah! I'm crazy to think...
she decided this flight would have to be grounded.
you don't scare me.
Oh. Oh!
what the hell is she doing?!
open up! Give me my baby!
good thinking, lynette!
I am not on your side, ed. You're not?
no, i am on miy's side.
she is the one caught in the middle, and i'm not letting you two have her until you calm down.
I want my damn child.
Lynette, i have tom on line two.
pat, can you see here i'm holding a baby hostage?!
I will call back!
all right, that's it. I'm calling the police.
Oh, for god's sakes! Lynette's not going to hurt the baby!
no, and you're gonna get her back a whole lot faster if you will just listen to me, okay?
listen, and you? All right, good.
so first of all, ed, stealing the baby was really stupid.
thank you. You're welcome.
you need to find a better way to communicate with your wife.
and, fran, i know what the pressure of trying to be a super parent does to your head.
you can take a break and be a great mom.
doesn't this little sweetheart deserve a well-rested mommy?
well, i guess the pressure does get to me a little.
and it's okay to admit that.
this is communication. This is good.
why don't you guys go down to the lobby, talk it out over some coffee?
uh, what about mindy?
we've got day care!
we've got day care hi. I called earlier from the spiritual outreach program?
Hi. Piano player, right?
this is so generous of you.
there it is. It's not exactly a concert grand.
I should warn you, on the whole, our patients are generally unresponsive, so i hope you don't expect a lot of clapping.
miss delaney, i find when the spiritual rewards are this great, who needs applause?
excuse me.
did addison talk to you about me?
Oh! I guess not.
he's a married man!
what's wrong with you?! No, wait! Wait!
it's not what you think!
he hasn't touched me for three years because of sluts like you!
Carol, if you would just stop throwing things at me, i'll explain!
how... how can you explain?! You're screwing my husband!
no, i'm not screwing him! He's my father!
I'm so sorry.
I thought you should know, but he didn't want to tell you.
I want to die.
Oh, no. I do.
Oh, carol, you don't have to clean that up.
they have clerks for that.
how old are you?
we've been married 39 years.
it's been going on from the start.
believe me, i didn't want to hurt anyone.
I just wanted to find my dad.
I'm glad you did, but you be careful, sweetheart.
he's gonna break your heart.
Andrew, i made an appointment with a therapist for you, me and danielle.
I don't think so.
this pain that you're feeling is completely natural, but it's not gonna go away until you deal with it.
Andrew, i want us to heal, i want us to be a familygain.
you know what i want?
I want for george williams to walk through that door so i can take a knife and plunge it into his heart.
I want the pharmacist to pay for what he did to my father.
well, the good news is he's... he's dead.
he committed suicide. His death was on his terms.
that's not justice.
so are you saying if he were executed that it would be easier for you to get past this of course.
George... didn't intend to commit suicide.
he was trying to manipulate me into taking him back, and he swallowed those pills hoping that i'd feel sorry for him.
he just assumed that i would call an ambulance.
when i got there, he was already slipping away.
I tried to get him to accept responsibility for what he'd done...
but he wouldn't.
so what'd you do?
nothing.
I just sat there and let him die.
ohmy god.
he didn't die on his terms, andrew.
he paid for what he did to your father.
thank you for telling me this.
Hey, how you doin'?
yeah?
Zach's come home.
what? Is he okay?
he's fine.
is there anything i can do?
thanks for askin you can leave us alone.
I spent a lot of time looking for zach, and you know why.
maybe i'm not making myself clear.
you come near my son, i'll go to the police.
I'll tell them what happened out in that quarry.
you do that and we'll both go down.
well, you know i'm capable of almost anything.
Hey, i thought you'd like to know zach and i are moving away.
I want to give my son a shot at a normal life.
I'm sure you'll agree it's for the best.
now see, this is where you and i don't see eye-to-eye.
for zach's sake, i'll keep quiet, for now, but you're not taking him away.
if i see a "for sale" sign in front of that house, i'll call the police.
I'm capable of pretty much anything myself.
the doctor's going to give you a full work-up, then we'll start the inoculations.
make sure you fill out everything and the nurse will take you back. Thank you.
boy, sister mary's done a number on you.
right.
Yes, right.
she has you flying halfway across the world to help the poor, and there's perfectly good poor right here.
for god's sakes, give a buck to a homeless gu it's not the same.
no, it's better because you can do it in the comfort of your own car.
the point is not to be comfortable, gaby.
it's about easing pain and suffering.
look, i'm trying to be a better person here.
now you can either help me or you can get out of the way, but you can't stop me.
come with me, please.
finish that for me.
here.
he didn't fill out the allergy section.
honey, he's going to a remote village in africa.
does it really matter that he's allergic to eggs?
actually, yes. Eggs are on the list.
he could have a severe reaction to the yellow fever vaccine, and he won't be getting out of bed, let alone leaving the country.
Really?
Oh, don't write that down.
I wasn't being specific. He's allergic to fish eggs.
fish eggs?
poor baby's gone his whole life without caviar.
now that's suffering.
all right, doc, give me all you got.
it's so hot in this village.
baby, that's the fever talking.
the doctor said you're having an allergic reaction, but you're gonna be fine, okay?
hold me.
Ohh, honey. I'm so sorry.
Ohh, maybe that stupid nun is right.
maybe i am trying to stop you from becoming a better person.
it's just that i love you the way you are...
greedy, selfish and insensitive.
I'm just scared if you're not those things anymore, you're gonna wake up one day and realize i still am, and then you won't want me.
I want you. Just hold me.
Ohh.
Ohh, carlos.
hold me...
sister mary.
painting in the rain? Is that smart?
well, let me see, painting in the rain or letting the whole world think i'm a whore?
I don't know. What do you think?
heard you ran into my wife.
Yep.
so?
so you are hereby released of any further obligation to be my dad.
okay.
just so you know, i'm not actually proud of what i've done, you know, my hobbies.
good for you. Bye.
I have done things i'm proud of.
I could give you five examples right now.
okay, maybe three.
you don't have to do this.
I was a volunteer fireman.
I put out fires, i got kittens out of trees, the whole nine yards.
sweet.
about 20 years a, i started a foundation to protect wild horses.
I probably saved hundreds of them.
Really?
I'm full of surprises.
okay, one more.
I wasn't exactly thrilled when you walked back into my life.
now that i've met you, well, you gave me a third thing to be proud of.
that was a good one.
that's why i saved it for last.
I have to spend some time working on my marriage.
when that's all sorted out, maybe we could continue with the catching up?
I'll wait for your call.
the stories are as old as time itself...
the prodigal son who returns home to the father who forgives him...
the jealous wife who tricks the husband who trusts her...
the desperate mother who risks everything for the child who needs her and the faithless husband who hurts the wife who loves him so deeply.
why do we listen again and again?
because these are the stories of family, and once we look past the fighting, pain and the resentment, we occasionally like to remind ourselves...
Hi! Hi.
there is absolutely nothing more important.
Hi, bunny, bunny. Hi.
would you bring me a Coke please?
of course. Only a Coke? -No, with ice.
here's your drink.
thank you.
I don't have change.
don't tell me. Don't you have something smaller?
no, that's all I have.
well, what am I going to do then?
you're going to leave me broke. Take it.
you're leaving me broke here.
so quickly?
thank you very much.
wait, wait. I have change from the taxi.
if it's no trouble, maybe it would be better... I'll give you this.
$50, no?
$50 and the $50 that I already gave you, that's $100.
so if you give me $100, we'll be even.
I give $100 to you?
the $100 bill for the change.
okay. Take it.
what kind?
lights.
what the fuck are you trying to pull?
I just need security here.
security. I need security.
I already give you your change. What the fuck are you trying to pull?
you're trying to rip me off -Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm a police officer. What's the problem? -He's trying to rip me off.
sorry, I was trying to buy cigarettes... -Be quiet.
I'll get to you in a minute.
now, ma'am, what is your name? -Dolores.
Hey, L. A.P. D. Vice. I got this. Okay?
okay, Dolores. Calm down and tell me exactly what happened.
he asked me for cigarettes. He gave me a $50.
now he says he gave me $100. He's trying to rip me off.
okay. Is that true? -No. It's not true.
I was just buying cigarettes. Then she start to shout.
I don't know what's going on -You know what?
this seems a little familiar.
maybe we should talk to the waitress you bought the Coke from.
should we do that?
officer, would you mind asking that waitress to come over?
now, what is your name?
what's your name?
get over here.
don't make it hard.
just relax.
calm down. Slow down.
all right. What's your problem?
you been doing some drugs? You high today?
9: 30 in the morning, and you're high.
Dolores, you okay? -Fine.
all right. You stay right here. I'm gonna need a statement from you. Let's go.
keep her there, okay? I'll be right back.
right here.
stand against the car.
what's going on? -Just relax.
all right. Get in.
I'm not a cop. Get in. I'll drop you off.
no tricks, all right? You wanna learn what you were trying to do?
I never thought about it -Well, you ought to start.
you know what? I'm okay -You don't know what you don't know.
unless it was part of your plan to get pinched and beaten for $45.
listen, they got security cameras on us now. You want a ride or not?
okay.
so you know what I do, right?
I usually work with another guy. My partner, a Jew.
disappeared a week ago, and no idea where he is, so...
...I gotta find a new partner.
why me?
I can't do what I do alone.
you can only go so far by yourself.
you can survive, but if you want more than that...
...you gotta work with someone. And I got a lifestyle to support.
look, I don't wanna be your friend, okay?
I'll tell you that right off the bat. This is work.
so if I ask you personal questions...
...It's because the more I know, the more I can develop your role.
you understand? -Yeah.
you speak good English? -Yeah. Pretty good.
all right, so, what's your name?
rodrigo -What?
rodrigo -No.
no, we gotta Anglo you up a little.
Brian -Brian?
Yeah, Brian.
what's your name? -Richard.
richard Gaddis.
is it up here? -Yeah.
here.
nice color.
Yeah.
so how about this.
you give me a couple hours...
...I show you some basics, get you warmed up.
if it works out, we'll kick it up a notch.
you hate it, you walk.
I hate you, you walk. Nobody gets hurt.
okay -Yeah?
yeah -All right.
look. It's my experience people are more likely to give money...
...to someone who looks like they already have money. Okay?
I walk up to you all decked out, standing in front of this car...
...I got some kind of emergency.
you know, under normal circumstances, I don't need anybody's help, right?
in my neighborhood, you'd be dead.
Yeah. Well, that's why we're not working your neighborhood.
ever been to Westwood? -No.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? -Hello? Debbie?
sorry.
who is this? -Sorry. Wrong apartment.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
grandma? -Yes?
who is it?
what, you don't recognize your favorite grandson?
Nicholas? -How are you?
well, I can't believe it. It's been so long.
when did you get to town? -Oh, I got in last night.
are you all right? I hardly recognized your voice.
I know, I'm... I just got over something.
but I'm not contagious, don't worry -You came to visit me?
you'll be mad. I'm with a friend. We were visiting somebody nearby...
...and my rental car broke down.
the rental car? -Yeah.
it's one of those Cooper MINIs. Seen those?
a what? -It's no bigger than your toaster.
it's so cute, you'll love it. Guess what color it is. Guess.
turquoise? -No. I wanted turquoise.
they gave me a blue one. Cobalt, they call it.
anyway, the guy is coming to tow the car back to the rental place...
...and I don't have any money to give him. I left my wallet at the hotel.
how could you go out without your wallet?
I know. You know me, so stupid.
I am so sorry. This is so embarrassing.
but if you have just $100, it would be a huge help.
I'll go back to the hotel, switch the car and come back with the money.
it'll take 15 minutes.
okay?
are you there?
if Jerald ever found out about this, he would absolutely flip.
I don't think we should tell Jerald.
can't you come up for a minute?
I can't. I have to wait with the car.
but I'm with my friend. If you could give him the money...
his name is Brian. He's really nice. He's Spanish.
Oh, okay -Mexican.
I'm coming down -Okay.
it's okay to leave it with your friend?
Oh, yeah. He's real nice. He's a friend from school.
grandma, the tow truck is coming. I gotta go. I have to go.
Hey.
she gave me 200 -Sweet.
and she said you should give this back to your mother.
why don't you keep it? Got a girlfriend? Give it to her.
no. I told you, I'm not, like, a professional crook.
whatever. You want the ring? -No, it's not that.
what is it? -You know...
you know, the old lady, man.
Oh, I see. Waitress in a casino, fine.
trusting old lady, never.
come on.
she told me I look like her nephew, the one who died of blood poisoning.
are we still talking about this? -Yeah.
I don't know, man. It was weird, that's all.
so why don't you just go back and confess.
I don't feel anything for them, okay?
they're marks.
and some of them are dumber than fucking pets.
you ever been to Beverly Hills? -No.
it's a great place to work.
all right. So...
...go in here, order a soy latte to go.
okay.
pay with this.
then come find me. All right? -Cool.
I need money -Yeah, join the club.
no, but I need a lot of money. I need a lot of money now.
how much? -A lot.
how much? -Seventy.
Seventeen? -No, 70. 7-0.
for what?
for my old man. He owes it.
gambling? -Yeah.
how much do you have?
Thirty-eight.
who does he owe it to? -This guy. This Russian guy.
if I were you, I'd get a new old man.
I gotta do something. They might kill him.
they probably will. Which is why you should stay out of it, okay?
look, I don't wanna hurt anybody.
I'm not a violent person. I've never even seen a gun go off.
that stuff at the casino was choreography. I was totally in control of that.
don't get involved with these people. I'm telling you.
it's my dad.
I gotta do something.
personally, I don't get the family thing. It's like a big fucking circle, you know?
you're like your dad, and he was like his dad...
I fought with my mother, so now I fight with my sister.
it's boring.
you know what the biggest jerk-off of all is?
beyond family even, because you can't control your family, is jobs.
I mean, this totally mystifies me.
can you believe people actually accept this?
it's like you work all day, people tell you what to do all day long.
you know, and then on top of taking shit all day, they can fire you.
well, what did your father do? -He was an astronaut.
take off.
what? -Take off. Say goodbye.
Oh, okay -I can't believe I ran into you.
good to see you -I'm in a hurry. Gotta go.
have a good one -See you.
excuse me. Could I get my change, please?
what change, sir?
the change for the hundred.
what hundred?
I paid you 10 minutes ago with a $100 bill -Sir, you didn't pay me.
excuse me, Daniel, maybe you got too many tables or something.
I asked if you could break 100, you said yes.
sir, you're mistaken -We're past the "sir" stage.
I need to see the manager -Sir...
I don't wanna talk to you anymore. You understand?
I wanna talk to the manager and get my change.
you didn't pay, so don't shout -I don't wanna shout, but I'm late.
now, I wanna see the manager. Get your boss. Don't be stupid.
is there a problem? -Yes, this gentleman says he paid.
no, I did pay you -There seems to be confusion.
no, no confusion. I had a cup of coffee.
I had two $100 bills, and now I have one.
Oh, here. The corner's missing.
so it must be missing the corner.
can you check for a bill with a corner missing?
sir... -I'm not going anywhere.
get my change. I have to get out of here.
I knew that trick.
Oh, yeah? -Yeah.
did you ever try it? -No.
why not?
it's too loud.
what? -You know...
...you have to make a whole scene.
that's the point.
they're not interested in making a scene.
that's the key, okay?
the more offended you are, the less suspicious.
if things get sticky, you blame everybody else.
have you been paying attention? -Yeah.
I just think it's too emotional, that's all.
this is private.
Hey.
so listen, I've been thinking about it. Go ahead and file it.
Yeah.
I gotta go.
I got somebody here. I gotta go. Bye.
who was that?
my lawyer.
Hey, so, what's next?
I don't know.
maybe we should go our own ways.
the Jew is gonna come back soon. He finds out I replaced him, he'll be pissed.
the Jew gets jealous -No, wait.
tell me. What is it? -You're not into it.
you're distracted or something. Maybe this shit with your father, I don't know.
you'll fuck something up.
what could I fuck up?
you think too much.
I think too much? But why is that bad?
you see what I'm saying? -Tell me, why?
you'll hesitate. Okay? You'll blow a frame.
I can't risk that. That'll be three for me. Three.
look, I need the money.
I can't make what I need on my own -Yeah, well, too bad.
it's not about memorization.
this is a choice, okay? You're not ready.
you think it's something to do for now. It's not some summer job, okay?
you can get the Wilshire bus down here.
can you get that purse in less than two minutes?
what purse? -That one.
she has to voluntarily hand me her purse? -In two minutes.
no -I can.
no, you can't -I bet you the ring.
right?
please -Thank you.
which floor? -Four. Thank you.
sir? -Ten, please.
Oh, God. Oh, brother -Goddamn it.
is it an earthquake? -No. Don't worry. Don't worry.
everything is okay -I can't stay calm. I'm claustrophobic.
I'm really not good at this -This is not good.
please, please do something -Just relax.
let's call somebody.
I'm doing it, but it will take more than 20 minutes.
I'm sure -I'm really not good at this.
what are you doing? Don't open the door.
it's easy -Calm down and wait for the authorities.
no, that takes... -You push the call?
I did -You're being impatient.
no, listen, this is how people get hurt. Don't open the door.
wait, did you push the call? -Yes, he did.
this won't take more than two minutes.
I'm not going out there -This was easy. Okay.
let's just stay here. Let's you and I stay here.
I'm not gonna wait -You can use the stairs. I'll help.
what do you mean? That way? -I'll hold your purse.
I'll hold your purse.
okay. There you go.
what do I do? -It is an easy jump. Come on.
all right, all right -Can you help her, sir?
Yeah. Yeah, here. Let me...
come on. Come on. It's gonna be easy.
that stuff in the elevator, you made that up?
that was good.
you have one thing money and practice can't buy.
you look like a nice guy.
what?
you look like a nice guy. It's good.
Hey, you guys, seriously. When I am on the...
quiet! When I am on the phone, I am on the phone.
okay? That means you don't talk.
Oh, my God.
holy shit.
didn't you see me? -Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I was standing right here -God, I didn't even see you.
there are people around -Are you okay?
you could buy gas -Of course I could buy gas.
I could also not buy it.
nobody would buy it if they didn't have to.
you wouldn't have got that woman out of the elevator, would you?
you would've just grabbed it and left her -What?
I said I could get her purse. I never said I would steal it.
I never said you said that.
what?
here.
it's in there.
so here's my office. Hey.
Teddy called.
when? -This morning.
What'd you say? -That you were in the hospital.
you want a Coke? -Yeah. Sounds good.
two Cokes.
someone is looking for you? -Yeah. Some cop.
a cop? Really? A cop is looking for you?
relax, will you? You see a SWAT team outside?
Ron's.
hang on.
Valerie.
fuck.
yeah?
Why?
well, I can't.
because I can't. Because I'm in the middle of something.
it'll take me an hour to get down there.
no. It's all the way fucking downtown, Valerie. Forget it.
that's your problem. Hey...
I don't know what you're talking about, okay? I don't know who that is.
all right, you want me to come? I'll come. But I'm warning you.
if this is some fucking ruse to get me to talk about...
all right.
fine. Fine.
all right. Bye.
come on.
we're leaving?
who was that? -My sister.
what does she want? -I don't know.
some guy I know collapsed in the lobby of the hotel where she works.
had a heart attack or something. Hey, hey. No drinks in the car.
seriously. Drink it or whatever.
you got any brothers or sisters?
an older brother.
Where's he? -In Arizona.
what's he do? -He's gay.
that's his occupation? What's he do?
sells furniture or something.
you don't talk to him? -Not that much.
how come?
he had a different father than me, okay?
Whoops.
Whoops" what?
Whoops" whoops.
what about you?
it's just you and your sister?
why do you wanna know? -I just told you.
one sister, one brother. Both younger.
what are they like?
my brother's great.
Michael.
great kid, really bright.
what's your sister like?
what's my sister like?
my sister likes giving me shit.
your sister works here? -Yeah.
okay. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.
who's this?
Brian -Hey. Nice to meet you.
I called you -He's working with me. What do you want?
do you wanna show me what you have to show me, Valerie?
or do you wanna make a scene in the lobby of your four-star hotel?
Richard, this is where I work.
I don't want you or your associates doing business here.
I heard you -Then why are your partners collapsing here?
who was it? -An old Spanish guy.
that narrows it down. Did he give his name?
Choa? Ochoa?
Ochoa's dead.
well, Ochoa was creating a disturbance in the lobby...
...trying to see a guest. A VIP, a VVIP.
so I had him escorted out -Yeah, see? My sister the snitch.
while this friend of yours was being escorted out of my hotel...
...he fainted or something. He had a seizure.
I don't need this, Richard.
the house doctor's probably gonna call an ambulance.
what's this have to do with me? -He was screaming your name.
he recognized me. He begged me to call you.
so I called you.
yeah? And I'm supposed to...? -Go in there, calm him down.
make sure that he doesn't come back, and don't you come back either.
you called me -I know.
do what you need to do, Richard, and go.
let me get this straight. You came to the hotel asking for Hannigan.
and when you couldn't get through, you got nervous.
and then you collapsed. Right?
so now you need someone to help you sell the goods today.
right? -Yeah.
so, what made you think of me? -Because I saw your sister.
the Monroe Silver Certificate.
I copied it.
it took me an entire year. I almost ruined my eyes.
you copied it from what? -From a set of photographs...
...taken by the Treasury Department.
I have a partner in the inside. He's my son-in-law.
he's the one who taught me about the bill in the first place.
he read a story about Hannigan's collection of antique currency.
he went and pulled the file on it.
see, he's a janitor, but he's smart. He came to me.
yeah? So Ochoa the forger has a relative in the Treasury Department?
Yeah. Yeah.
sounds like a sting -No. He's married to my daughter.
how come you never told me before?
he's black, I didn't wanna get into it with you.
look, he's gonna send it to a lab -No.
a lab test will take a week at least.
he won't have time for that. He'll be gone tomorrow.
how do you know?
how do I know?
look at this. He says he's negotiating to buy a group of TV stations...
...but the seller is stalling the negotiations.
this says that Hannigan operates as a resident of Monaco.
if he doesn't leave tomorrow, he'll be over the number of days...
...he can spend in the U. S. Without paying tax on all his business all over the world.
and that could be tens of millions of dollars.
okay, how much you gonna ask?
well, I don't know. Double whatever he offers.
but, Richard... Richard, it's got to be done today.
yeah -It's now or it's never.
let go. Let go of me -Okay?
don't cough on me!
okay. I'm gonna give you 20 percent.
look. You're confused. Okay?
if I leave now, all you get is a tube up your ass at the hospital.
look, I can call somebody else -Yeah, go ahead. Here, use my phone.
how much you want? -Ninety percent.
but that's crazy -No, it really isn't.
look, okay, 50-50.
I should have called somebody else.
hey -Hey.
so I gotta go meet the son-in-law and go to Ochoa's.
so you're doing it -Of course. If I sell it, I get 90 percent.
but this is fucking federal shit, man -Yeah, and it's a six-figure score.
okay. Listen. Hold on a minute.
what? What?
I want in -In where?
the deal. I need the cash, man. I want a part.
a part? What? -We're together for the day, right?
just a small percentage -Because I'm nice?
this guy got me through my sister. Who do you think you are?
the day just took a turn. Okay?
come on, I was there.
your name is? -My name is Valerie.
Valerie.
what are you doing? -I need to get my parking validated.
is that Hannigan? That guy you were talking to?
leave him alone, Richard.
don't tell him you have a boyfriend. It'll cut your tips in half.
do you remember a song, an old R & B song from the '70s?
it goes something like:
don't remember? -That's it, let's go.
I won't bother you again -Nothing else you wanna say to me?
Oh, yeah. Talk to your lawyers -Your lawyers are holding things up.
that's what they do -What about Michael?
this isn't about him -It's all about him.
you sued me, and now it's gonna play out.
what do you want? -Richard.
I want your lawyer to... -Hey, Mike.
how are you? -Good.
I'm okay. I'm working here -She's got you all dressed up.
it's not a bad job. I'm just getting the swing of it, but tips are great.
that's what I hear -I gotta get back to work.
I'll see you later? -Yeah.
be good -Yeah, good to see you.
he's a great kid. Hope you're not fucking him up.
would you please leave now?
Ciao.
the Treasury removed silver and gold certificates from circulation in 1934.
they asked people to redeem them in exchange for cash.
most people did, but collectors didn't.
treasury kept a list of all the bills that was printed and all that was redeemed.
and all but three of the bills countersigned by White are accounted for.
there's never been a recorded public sale of this bill.
so most people, including Treasury...
...think somehow the outstanding bills were either lost or destroyed.
so if one of these would happen to turn up...
...it'd be the most valuable piece of currency...
...in the history of the United States.
how my father-in-law? -Old.
got that right.
I gotta go.
so talk to Ochoa, all right?
all right, baby.
you wait here -No, I'm not waiting in the car this time.
fine.
come on. Watch and learn.
Mrs. Ochoa.
who are you? -Your husband's friend.
he sent us to pick up an envelope that he left for us.
it's a large, yellow envelope.
on the shelf under the Chinese jar -My husband isn't here.
he said even if he wasn't here we could pick up the envelope.
look for it, please -My husband is not in. Come back later.
ma'am, I heard you. We can't come back. This is very important.
Mr. Ochoa, Roberto, told me to come over here and pick up this envelope.
Roberto, my husband, isn't home.
so if he's not home, why do you want to get into the house?
stop meddling in your husband's business. Listen to me.
no, I can call the police -I don't wanna get in the house.
I just came to pick up something -I think you should go away.
no, no, no. Come on. Come on.
excuse me, we're going now.
my brother always gets worked up when we're going to visit our mother.
you're brothers?
we're half brothers.
he promised our mother we would bring the photos...
and that's why he's acting like this.
but we're only asking you a favor.
tell your husband that Richard and Brian were here, please.
we'll come back for the photos tomorrow.
Oh well. Thank you very much.
no, wait. Come here.
okay -No, no. Not you.
you stay over there.
there are photos for your mother in that envelope?
they were beautiful copies that your husband made...
that our mother loved very much.
the originals got damaged so your husband copied them.
that's why it's so urgent.
where does your mother live?
my mother lives in San Juan Capistrano.
San Juan Capistrano?
do you know San Juan Capistrano?
Oh, my son's wife is from San Juan Capistrano.
unbelievable! Wow, what a coincidence.
I love San Juan. It's one of the most beautiful places there is.
Yes, very beautiful -Isn't it true?
give me just one second.
what?
fifteen percent.
thirty -Fuck off.
you can't do this without me -I'll kill you first.
let's go.
minus expenses.
what a coincidence, I love San Juan Capistrano.
my mother is always telling us never to move her from San Juan Capistrano.
because she's always saying...
where a Gianolo is born they should also die.
she is family of Father Gianolo? -She is his cousin.
since we were children, we knew Father Gianolo.
and if Father Gianolo were to come visit us...
the problem is that Richard doesn't speak Spanish.
he only speaks English. We don't know who his father is.
that's why he's always fighting with mother.
Yeah.
Hey, hold on a second. Don't get fucking taco sauce all over it.
Yeah. What do you got?
what time?
all right. Thanks.
so Hannigan's at the hotel the rest of the afternoon.
they're having drinks at 3: 00 -How will you get to him?
Hey. Hey.
let's just relax. He'll come.
Hello?
Hey.
Yeah.
Yeah. I'm at the hotel.
as soon as I can.
well, I haven't met with him yet.
what?
because I know.
because I know.
because he's a collector, that's why.
Rebecca.
because he's leaving the country, that's why.
it's some bullshit world-tax thing.
all right. Love you.
Jesus.
Oh, your phone's working now?
you fuck!
what are you doing in such a nice hotel?
I'm making a sale. Straight up.
don't lie to me -I'm not.
you're making a deal in the bathroom, huh?
Richard? Hey...
police -Wait, wait.
who the fuck are you? You with him?
is he with you? -Yeah.
get in here.
come on! -Coming.
now, what the hell are you two up to?
this is a police matter. Step outside.
excuse me, officer. These gentlemen are here because I called them.
and who are you? -My name's William Hannigan.
I'm a guest here at the hotel.
you called them? -That's right.
why don't you put the gun down...
...and then we can possibly negotiate another means of resolving the situation.
well, I'm sure there is.
I'll let you know.
you come with me.
you two, stay put.
what are you trying to do to me? -You said, make it look real.
look real.
okay, we gotta go back in. Just take whatever he gives you.
what about my part? -I'll get it to you.
Yeah, you'll get it to me right now.
by the way, Teddy's looking for you.
I'll see him, soon as this is done -He's getting tired of leaving messages.
my pleasure.
follow me.
are you okay? -Yeah.
Where'd your friend get that gun? -Same place he got his badge. At his job.
you told the cop downstairs you got something to show me.
who are you?
I mean, I heard the name, but who are you?
I'm the person you were tipped off about.
look, you did us a favor downstairs, which we appreciate, but the truth is...
...I have no idea what you're talking about.
you got something to say? -No. No. He speaks for me.
what? -He speaks for me.
I'm just about to complete a $7-billion TV deal.
now, if you've got something to show me, then show me.
if not, there's the door. Fuck off.
you got time for us now?
you got this? -Yeah.
I want it -How much?
come back in two hours with the actual bill, and then we'll discuss the money.
you wanna do this today?
well, as you may have heard, I have to leave the country.
no, I hadn't heard that.
guess that makes us lucky -I'll settle for smart.
goat Man took me on my first trek when I was 11.
not long after that, he taught me how to do bong hits.
it doesn't matter where we go on these treks.
we just wander.
goat Man says it's the journey that counts.
which I know is cliche
in a few days, I leave for the prep school my father went to.
goat Man's calling this my "farewell trek."
he says I should soak up as much of the Sonoran sun as I can.
but he's the one doing most of the soaking.
Whoo!
you won't have all this at Gates Academy.
naked men shouldn't squat.
do you ever worry about your parents?
did you ever?
no.
not really.
Wendy will be fine.
I'll watch her.
goat Man once told me that in certain Native American tribes, an elder leads a young man out into the wilderness to fend for himself until he has a vision.
she never lets me milk her.
in one tribe, if no vision comes they'll chop off a fingertip and sacrifice it to the Great Spirit.
Thanks.
goat Man says I'm not quite ready for this rite of passage.
sorry I messed up the trek, Goat Man.
it's not your fault.
I should have never let you come out here with brand new boots.
I should have oiled them and let you walk around in them for a couple days before coming out here.
goat Man was my parents' friend first.
my mother claims she can't remember how they met, but Goat Man told me he used to sell them peyote.
at one point Goat Man was broke, so in exchange for cleaning the pool and taking care of the landscaping, they let him live in our pool house.
when I was a baby, my father left and Goat Man stayed.
my mom hasn't paid a bill in her entire life.
yet somehow she always knows how much money she has in her trust fund.
ten more minutes.
I'm going away to school, Frieda.
I need you to listen to Goat Man while I'm gone.
this is my neighbor Aubrey.
she's hot, yes, but at the risk of sounding like a misogynist...
I see you, Ellis!
what, are you jacking off back there?
...She's sort of a rancid bitch.
no, Frieda just stopped to eat.
that's a goat. -You're so dead!
pervert!
ignore the pain.
luckily, her meatheaded boyfriend was barefoot.
messed up feet and a big cut on your forehead.
not a very good send off.
Thanks, Goat Man.
are you packed yet?
Yeah, I finished this morning.
I prepared a bag of buds for you.
that shit'll cream your spinach.
ever heard of security checks?
I'll mail it to you.
my roommate better be cool.
he could have the best weed on the East Coast.
probably a Facebook addict with halitosis.
my boy's leaving me tomorrow.
leaving me for the big bad world of Gates Academy.
Ellis, your feet are all red!
from my new hiking boots.
figures Fucker Frank would send you third-rate hiking boots.
tightwad. -Those are, like,$300 boots from Italy.
I wish I had a pair.
that's not good parenting.
he should try calling you once in a while, at least pretend to care.
I ordered you 14 Oxford shirts.
you'll barely ever have to do laundry.
okay? - Okay.
not to mention everything else that I bought you.
I appreciate it.
you don't have to leave, you know.
you can still change your mind.
you act like I'm going off to war.
you don't get it, do you? You don't get it.
I'm sad. -You still have me.
Jav!
I paid 700 extra to the electric company, so you won't have to worry about that for another three months.
all the other bills are paid, and I renewed the insurance on the Volvo.
you don't even know how much I'm going to miss you.
you don't know. You don't know. You don't know.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
a lot.
mom.
my flight's in two hours.
you don't have to wait.
my flight's not, like, for another hour.
you sure? -Yeah.
go on. The goats are roasting in there.
I'll be fine.
you take care of Wendy, all right?
I'll call you once I get there... -Don't worry.
many rivers to cross, partner.
Bye, guys. Be good.
I think Frieda ate a map. -Bullshit.
Frieda!
damn it.
Wendy has referred to my father as "Fucker Frank
for as long as I can remember.
so you can imagine her reaction when I told her
I had secretly applied and was accepted here, the same prep school he went to.
so I heard this story about this guy who went to Berkeley, and every night when he would go to sleep, he would wake up and his ass would be sore.
so after three months of this,'cause it got really bad, he decided to go to the doctor and try to find out what's going on.
and the doctor said, "Well, have you been having any anal sex lately?"
because that's what it looks like your ass has been doing.
and the guy's like,"No, no. I'm straight. Why would I be doing that?
so the guy calls the cops to see if they can maybe figure out what's going on, and it turns out that his roommate was knocking him out with colorform every single night and butt fucking him. Crazy, right?
can I hang this on the door?
you must be Barney Cannel.
Yes, sir.
I was hoping Wilt Chamberlain there with Barney Cannel.
how tall are you, son?
I was 5'10" last time I checked.
I'm out of shape, though. -Get in shape. Run for us.
I don't think I'd be any good.
come on, don't tell me you're not going to play any sports.
I haven't really thought about it.
well, think about it.
dough boy, we practice every day from 3: 00 to 4: 00.
you miss two, you're off the team.
Yes, sir.
where are you going to go to college?
my brother Todd, he goes to Yale.
that's where I'm going. Yale.
are you serious? -Is that guy homeless?
no. He's a botanist.
and a goat trekker.
is he your dad?
no.
you're only supposed to be buttoned up for the convocation, moron.
welcome to Gates, boys.
Hi, I'm Barney Cannel, Todd Cannel's younger brother.
right.
Todd told me to tell you that he very much enjoys Yale.
thank you.
and you're Ellis Whitman? -Yes, sir.
Dr. Eldridge. We're happy to have you at Gates.
your father Frank and I were roommates, you know, and I was lucky enough to run with him senior year.
my father ran for student government?
he was class president, but I meant cross-country.
we were on the cross-country team together.
how is he?
he's fine, I guess.
you look like him, you know.
tell him to give me a phone call, will you?
Yeah, sure. -See you, boys.
Hey, I didn't know Eldridge and your dad boned.
it's been 23 days and four hours since I last got high.
the one kid I thought was a stoner here turned out to just be a slob.
there's no good Mexican food in a 200-mile radius.
goat Man's been incommunicado.
and when my classless, Teletubby of a roommate isn't whining about his grades, he's copying my homework.
sorry.
I shouldn't even be here.
our secret.
you know that one girl who works in the dining hall?
the one who Rosenberg says is a prostitute?
that trashy townie chick?
she's always sneaking in the library and using our shit.
Todd told me she is a prostitute.
she'll do juniors and seniors for, like, 50 bucks.
your brother's full of shit.
at least he's not a drug addict who hangs out with goats all day.
pot's not addictive.
Todd writes me and sends me letters.
Mr. Goat hasn't sent you shit.
his name's Goat Man, asshole.
Whitman. Come here.
I thought we weren't supposed to talk to each other out here.
only if you're going to go jerk off.
rosenberg's from Maui.
he's one of three Jews on the island.
he can't seem to get better than a C in any of his classes, but he's smart enough to get his weed through airport security.
man, I knew you were a stoner.
how? -I saw your High Times calendar and Barney said you smoke up with your gardener.
he's not my gardener. He's...
Mr. Rosenberg.
Mr. Cannel's roommate.
enjoying a little cannabis, I see and smell.
just me, sir. Rosenberg didn't have any.
he was actually trying to convince me to...
I'll deal with you later.
I need a moment alone to talk to the tall one.
keep it moving.
well.
looks like you'll be enjoying cross-country after all.
we practice at 3: 00 tomorrow.
pick it up, fellas. Pick it up!
I have bowels that run faster than you, let's move!
come on, Quadzilla, pick it up.
I can't.
you can't or you won't?
you weren't joking. You really are out of shape, huh?
I have blisters.
did those blisters stop you from hiking into the woods to smoke weed with Rosenberg?
move it, move it, move it!
five more hills, let's go!
hounds misses Sharky!
let's go
I missed her teeth!
here comes Mrs. Sharky!
let go!
that one scares me a little bit.
who are you?
I'm Bennet, Wendy's lover.
boy, oh, boy.
Oh, yeah.
must be nice, Javier, living here.
rent-free, just cleaning the pool.
taking care of the landscaping. No worries.
it is nice.
that's your name, isn't it? Javier?
sure.
that's so funny, you don't look like a Javier.
right, Wendy told me about your goat treks.
where do you go?
I wander. -Where?
I can't be specific.
why not?
it's my job.
hmm.
what do you do?
uh...
I'm an artist.
do you get high?
Oh!
I've moved beyond that.
sadness.
Hey! Quit it, Lance!
it's about time.
what's up?
I got a package to mail.
Hey, is this enough stamps?
if this is what I think it is, you might as well just go check yourself into prison right now.
once I handed it to you, I was home free.
not even close. How's Ellis out there, anyway?
I haven't heard from him yet, but I'm sure he's okay.
what about all my stamps?
peel them off.
Hey, you wanna get high?
I can't today.
Hey, leave it.
all right, come on, goats.
shit!
I don't know why you're surprised.
all stoners are unreliable. He's not going to send you anything.
shut the hell up.
it just doesn't make any sense.
I haven't seen him in years, and he thinks I'm just gonna show up on his doorstep?
well, at least your dad sends you letters.
mine's not allowed to.
look, I'll be down there in DC for Thanksgiving, too.
we can hang out and party in Georgetown.
what are you going to do?
sit around here and wait for pot in the mail that probably won't come?
don't stay here.
it's not gonna be any fun.
you're gonna do nothing.
and you're just gonna get depressed, all right?
come to DC with me.
what about her?
go ahead and ask her.
we both will.
excuse me, ma'am?
please don't call me ma'am. I'm barely 31 .
may we ask you a favor?
let me guess, you go to Gates, and you want me to buy you beer or cigarettes or porno.
just Budweiser. A six pack of Budweiser.
bottles or cans?
cans. -Bottles.
bottles.
then she made me and Todd watch a slide show on her laptop of my dad kissing another man on Poodle Beach in Rehoboth.
there's your father, boys.
there's your father and his boyfriend, in love.
then she came over and made Todd say, "My dad's a faggot."
I wouldn't say it, so she tried to move my jaw and that's when she burnt me with her cigarette.
by mistake.
my mailman's gay. -My dad's not gay.
that was just a phase. He lives with some woman in Houston now.
I'm not allowed to see him.
I don't know if my dad's in New York or DC.
he's always with some new slut... -I gotta pee.
shit.
fucker Frank.
runners, come on, let's go. Knees up!
Hello?
who's this?
let me talk to Wendy.
tell me who this is.
Hello?
is this 520-887-4311?
who is this?
put Goat Man on.
tell me who this is.
my mom has a new asshole boyfriend.
she'll have a meltdown if I go to Frank's.
so you'll stay here and eat depressing meals with the teachers and their grubby families?
come to DC.
that one question where you're supposed to find out how many grandchildren does Mrs. Smith have,
I kept getting negative six.
Yeah, Mrs. Smith and her grandchildren can suck my dick.
some dick got a 96 and messed up the curve.
Ellis and I studied our asses off all night, and I only got a 73.
What'd you get, Ellis?
ninety-six. -Douche.
Hey, here's my girl.
I see her here every Tuesday and Thursday at this time.
Yeah, after she's done servicing the juniors and seniors.
you're an asshole, Barney. -Shut the hell up.
Hi, Ellis.
Hey!
Ellis, how does she know your name?
this is the doll. She's brand new today, ladies.
we've done a version of Sasha before.
but this is a new configuration.
so it's the only day that...
Hello? Who is this?
tell Wendy that I'm spending Thanksgiving with Fucker Frank and his girlfriend in Washington.
if she doesn't want me to, she knows how to contact me.
and remind her that the Volvo is supposed to be serviced this month.
so, this is Ellis?
just tell her.
Oh, boy!
Mmm-hmm.
Ellis! Your mom just called.
she wants you to go to Tucson for Thanksgiving, and not to go to DC.
so she calls now?
she sounded really stoned!
come on. Let's go.
Oh, shit!
could you come over here and clean this, Javier?
I'll switch chairs.
excuse me?
you just got to pick up the shards and spray the juice with the hose before it gets sticky.
you broke the glass, not me. -Yes?
get up off your ass and clean it. I'm busy with this bush.
well, it's your job, not mine.
Hey, buddy, fuck you.
what did you say to me?
you're free-balling, man.
what?
one of your nuts wants out.
there you go.
I think that you and me and Wendy need to have a talk about your place around here.
you mean the pool house?
Oh! Who's awake! -Me! Me! Yeah, I needed to sleep!
Yeah.
I've been so worried. You know, Ellis never called.
the pool looks really nice, Javier. It's so blue.
aren't you the chick that threw the rock at Ellis?
Yeah. So what?
besides, Ellis was spying. -Come on.
I need to feel like a mom again.
it's been so long since Ellis left.
I'm going to take Aubrey to the mall.
I'll pick you up some of those boxer shorts you like.
Mmm. What about me?
we'll get you a new swimsuit.
that is so sick!
and Bennet, clean up that juice mess before the ants come.
what do you mean, you're leaving right now?
it's Thanksgiving!
stop, right now. You need to behave.
why do you have to go?
you know what, because I need to go.
please! This isn't fair!
it's totally fair.
because you're acting out. This is totally fair, now I feel justified.
she's such a bitch.
tastes like ass.
you would know.
if your friend's sleeping over,
I don't want him touching anything in the guest room.
I leave in two hours. Don't touch anything.
the credit card is in the kitchen.
you can have Thanksgiving at the Beckers'.
fine.
at least you can do whatever you want the whole weekend.
if she weren't so selfish, she would be going to Paris on Monday instead.
my mom wrote the book on selfish.
fuck.
I'll call you later, okay? -All right.
it's good to see you. You look tall.
I grew, I guess.
you look different, too. -Yeah?
Yeah.
Judy will be glad to know that you think I look different.
she's been sort of cultivating my new image.
Oh, yeah? -Yeah.
I forgot to show you my store back there on the right.
I actually sold all 48 stores to a furniture conglomerate.
they're changing the name to Adobe, which I think is dumb, but...
what do you do now?
I still... I keep pretty busy.
Yeah, I read a lot.
Yeah.
a senator from Georgia lived in this house for 30 years in the 1 800s.
that's actually a portrait of him there.
dog lover, I guess.
listen, about Judy and me, the reason I wanted you to visit...
I thought I smelled it in the car. Have you been drinking?
Hey, guys.
Ellis, it's so nice to finally meet you.
you, too.
whoa. You been hitting the bottle today?
that's what I thought.
why don't you bring your bag upstairs? It's the first bedroom on the left, and then you can meet us at the table.
you can eat off any lingering inebriation.
he'll be okay.
I don't share Judy's cavalier attitude about your drinking.
I don't have a cavalier attitude.
Ellis, do you want some more stuffing?
Yes, ma'am.
Ellis, you can call me Judy.
you know, you're the one who's cavalier. You're married again.
I'm gonna have a new brother or sister, and you didn't even tell me.
brother.
a new brother.
you're only 14 years old.
what were you drinking?
and where the hell were this kid's parents anyway?
I'm 15 years old.
we were drinking scotch, and Barney's mother's in Paris.
he never sees his father.
is that supposed to mean something?
he spilled the scotch on me, by the way.
that's why you could smell it. I barely had any.
okay.
excuse me.
Hey, Frank knows you're 15.
I mean, that's how he refers to you, as his 15-year-old son.
he sent you those hiking boots for your birthday last June.
I was with him when he bought them.
when he got your midterm grades, he called to tell me about them. All As.
he said he never once got all As at Gates.
he's proud of you, Ellis.
whoa. No.
Thanks.
you've neverheard of Gates Academy? It's very famous.
it's very traditional.
no cell phones, no Internet in the dorms, they force you to take Latin.
tell Ellis not to worry. I mean, Latin's a dead language.
it's useless. -I'm taking Spanish.
say something in Spanish, honey.
that one's smart.
she just said,"I want to eat cheese."
sorry I'm late.
Ellis is with Frank, and he hasn't called.
he'll call.
you stoned? -No.
I told you I'm not.
I'm not.
I love your tie. It's so tribal.
okay, everybody, we are going veggie this year.
this is faux turkey.
it smells wonderful. -Tofu turkey. Who would've thought?
I wonder what kind of shit they're feeding Ellis in Washington.
you promised. No Frank talk.
so, Javier, tell me about the next goat trek you're planning.
it's still in the works.
the goats are in training. They're afraid of the water.
I'll be taking them up to higher elevation soon, to snow.
black and tan male with the horns, Lance...
Yeah, that's him. -Lance. Yeah.
he bothers me when I'm reading my paper by the pool. Very bad gas.
if goats don't fart, their intestines will explode.
I highly doubt it. -No, I've seen it. A major mess.
I saw a baby goat once, born inside out.
inside out. -Gross!
you know, Jav, I think you may be onto something with these goat treks.
Yeah, a return to the earth.
you know, I bet Johanna would love to hear about these goat treks, wouldn't she?
wouldn't she? She's our spirit coach.
she's always interested in new forms of spirit healing.
I'm not sure these treks have healed my spirit.
I bet they have.
you didn't even notice,'cause you're not in touch with your spirit.
it's a good point, Javier.
Oh!
what?
Hello? -Hey, Mom, it's me.
Ellis, I told you I needed you here this weekend.
why didn't you at least call me yesterday?
Ellis! Do you want me to wash your fleece?
Yeah, sure. Thank you.
what does she look like?
it's not the same Judy.
it's not the same Judy?
this one's really nice and attractive.
attractive?
okay. How young is she?
I don't know. Maybe a little younger than you.
figures.
what about Frank? -He's fine, I guess.
he has new glasses. Poetry glasses.
poetry glasses?
Hey, Ellis, Frank's home. It's time to go.
okay, thanks.
Hey, Mom. I'm sorry, but I have to go.
Why?
Frank has some kind of tour planned. He just got back.
you're making a big mistake.
mom, I have to go.
Bye. Okay? -Fine.
I've been looking for this record for years.
I can't even find it on the Internet.
do you even have a turntable?
Yeah, Goat Man got me one. -Of course he did.
so, you like Judy?
Yeah, she's really nice.
look, don't tell her I told you this, but when you wrote for me to come down here, at first I thought you were talking about the Judy you brought to Tucson a few years ago.
the loud obnoxious one... -That was Trudy.
and she wasn't obnoxious. She was nervous.
you know it was your mother that kept me away from Tucson for all that time.
every time I'd show up, she'd start some new drama, even if I didn't bring along a lady friend.
does she still refer to me as "Fucker Frank"?
hello. -Can you put Wendy on the phone?
who's calling?
you know who this is. Just put her on the phone.
I can't. She went to a healing vortex workshop in Sedona.
she won't be back till tomorrow.
okay, when she gets back, tell her I've gone on a trek, backside of Mt. Lemmon.
four days. She likes to know where I go.
Why? As far as I can tell, she wouldn't care if you disappeared.
she's done with your chemically-induced lifestyle.
I didn't ask for your response to that... Hello?
Dick!
he's a dick!
Hey, guys.
you fuckers ate my weed!
that's it, you win!
idiots.
Yikes.
you ordered the health food?
dig in.
pizza.
Ugh. I already feel like a cow.
you're not a cow. Not even close.
he can come back anytime.
Hey, you know, you should really think about joining us in Telluride this summer.
you can mountain bike and camp and swim.
and we'll have the baby by then.
Hello?
hello. May I please speak with Ellis Whitman?
just a minute.
it's for you.
is it my mother?
no, it's your roommate. He's very polite.
what? -I got pot!
I meant what I said about Telluride.
I think it'd be great for you to come out this summer.
I don't think so.
Frank, come on. -Are you kidding, honey?
he shows up drunk for Thanksgiving dinner.
you sneak out last night to do God knows what.
how are you going to stay in school?
I'm getting all As except for an A- in Latin.
mea culpa.
how do you expect me to do this when you don't give a shit?
you don't give a shit, either.
are you kidding me? -Okay. Guys?
all right.
you know, if you were getting an inheritance from your dad, now you have to split it.
haven't you had enough of that shit?
don't tell me what to do.
you're gonna have to wash those in the sink.
I can smell the alcohol from over here.
you can't leave them there, we'll get busted.
go wash them in the sink. -Fuck you, you're not my boss.
what's your problem?
wash the fucking pants!
my award! You asshole!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Get up!
get up. Both of you calm down!
are you okay?
let's get to the bottom of this so we can all get on with our lives.
tell me what happened tonight.
Barney was being obnoxious, so I tackled him.
and before that?
Barney was being obnoxious before that.
he means, what did you do before the fight?
like, were you and Barney drinking any alcoholic beverages?
I'm quite capable of expressing myself, Mr. Rosenberg.
and why are you here, anyway?
I'm not feeling good. I think I have the flu.
you can wait in the hall until I'm done speaking with Whitman here.
but I'm suffering from FACT. Fever, aches, chills, and tiredness.
the hall.
I'll tell you what happened.
you and Barney, Mr. Cannel.
you and Mr. Cannel were drinking on the bus.
you argued, you started to fight, you threw his award against the wall, and he kicked you in the testicles.
that sounds pretty close, sir.
I've looked at your midterm reports, Mr. Whitman. You're doing well.
I study a lot. -Mmm-hmm.
so tell me about your visit with your father. How's he doing?
okay.
now, business.
no more weekend privileges, and you're going to have sequestered detention dinners until next semester.
and, of course, you know I'm going to have to call your mother in Texas to inform her of this incident.
I live in Arizona, sir. -Of course. Phoenix.
Tucson. -You bet.
Hi, Wendy.
get down here and roll.
listen to your body, Javier. You know, it's good stress therapy.
no, thanks.
I was wondering if...
you know where your checks are?
if I could maybe... I was thinking I could...
I could write myself one, for, you know, last month.
I ordered that Fortunella japonica, the kumquat bush for outside the den window.
the headmaster called from Gates this morning.
Ellis did some drinking on the way back to school from his stay with Fucker Frank.
he and his roommate got into a fistfight.
and I have to write a check for $700 to patch a wall that Ellis broke.
I can't see Ellis in a fight like that. Is he okay?
no, of course he's not all right. What do you think?
after a weekend with Frank, I'm sure he's a total wreck.
the headmaster also said that Ellis has the highest grades in his class.
they're turning him into a Frank clone.
they're already talking to me about colleges.
he's only 15. -I know.
he shouldn't have to worry about things like that.
I can't take care of him from here, Javier. I can't.
I can't do it.
I miss him.
I miss him so. I miss him way more than I thought. Way more.
how are the bills and stuff? -That's not why I miss him.
I'm a mother and my son is 3, 000 miles away.
I am missing a piece of myself.
he'll be home soon.
Johanna said that mothers and sons, even though we share the same blood, can sometimes be as cosmically distant as two strangers on different continents.
I don't see why a mother should be concerned about relating cosmically.
you should just call him up, and ask him about school, food, girls.
I should really just be mainstream?
sure.
sorry, nothing came for you.
Thanks.
you can check again tomorrow.
Hey.
someone hasn't been at dinner in a while.
I got sequestered detention dinners until next semester.
I never took you for a bad boy.
you're always in here. -I'm not illiterate.
I'm working my way through a list of the 100 best novels of all time.
this is my third favorite book.
the Great Gatsby.
my second's To Kill a Mockingbird.
all right. What's your favorite?
wouldn't you like to know.
you know, you can play your music louder. I don't mind.
Thanks.
I'm gonna fail algebra tomorrow, and I'm gonna fail history on Wednesday, and I'm gonna flunk out of Gates.
I guess you're not going to Yale.
I probably deserve it for kicking you in the nuts.
that was a cheap kick.
I'm sorry.
I just...
I can't even do completing the square and I only know the first cycle of the Krebs cycle and all the kings in history seem the same. And I just...
I don't know what to do anymore.
I'm gonna flunk out of Gates. I'm never gonna do anything.
here's a good trick for history that Goat Man taught me, all right.
see this portrait of Pope Leo X?
Mmm-hmm.
look at him. Remember his name and read what he did, then imagine him doing it. Okay?
you know, I owe you one. You really saved my ass.
I know.
I'm going to study over break, so I'm not such a loser next semester.
I'm gonna float on a raft in the pool and smoke a bale of pot and go running a lot.
won't the pot cancel out the running? -Hey, bad boy!
merry Christmas.
you know, Smythe and VanBuren were in the car with Minnie.
she's probably giving them a ride to the bus station or something.
I bet she's giving them a ride.
the water's nice.
it's nice and warm.
I love the water.
Yes. Yeah.
okay, boy.
right there.
good boy.
there you go.
you have pretty nice arms for a stoner.
Oh, hey.
what are you doing?
the goats hate water, so I'm training them not to.
well, I hate to break it to you, but there's no water in there.
well, you obviously know nothing about training goats.
first they have to get used to the pool.
what are you doing later?
you sure are nosy.
I just want to know what makes you tick, Javier.
for example, what are those?
ever hear of art?
Bennet and Wendy are in Sedona on that New Age bullshit spirit workshop, right?
when do they get back?
that was quick. I was just getting comfortable.
what do you do?
what do you do all day?
do?
you know, I do the landscaping.
work with the goats.
clean the pool.
don't you get bored?
well, I do other stuff.
like get high all day?
is it true what they say about you and your goats?
that you know them in the biblical sense?
it's not true.
I hate my goats.
what the hell?
sorry. Are you Ellis? -Give me my bag!
pervert.
Oh! Oh!
I'm not a pervert, I'm Bennet.
Wendy?
mom?
Ellis.
you scared the hell out of me, Ellis.
sorry.
I've had these miserable headaches since September.
starts in my heart, goes around my head, and back down to my heart.
come here, come give your mom a hug and tell me how was your trip.
I slept on my flights. -Yeah.
did you miss me?
of course I missed you. -I couldn't tell.
Yeah, that's it. Toke the fat pappy, girlie.
Hey, Ellis!
Aubrey?
that's my bong.
I thought your plane didn't get in till tonight.
Lance, leave it!
Lance, quit it!
I can't even get him to follow me.
maybe he's disappointed in you.
I know you think I'm a traitor, but... -She's not even half your age.
she looks older, you have to admit.
you could have at least written me or something.
Yeah.
I'm bad at that.
sorry.
and Bennet.
you should have warned me about him.
Yeah.
he's a royal dick.
Hey, I'm going on this big trek the day after Christmas.
down into Mexico.
you want to come, partner?
I don't know.
frieda, come on.
Ellis! -Hi, Jonathan.
how's the fancy prep school?
it's fancy. I study a lot.
I got blackmailed into running cross-country.
what about the girls? -What girls?
it's all boys. -Exactly!
did the Goat Man have any luck sending you any provisions?
he tried sending something via US Mail, but I stopped it.
Really?
it isn't worth the risk these days.
we have to make this fast!
because your Spanish is horrible.
it's past 6: 00 already. I should be home wrapping presents.
I appreciate it.
you haven't shown me how much you appreciate it.
I appreciate it this much.
what have you been getting up to lately anyway?
I've been breeding non-eco intrusive goats for the biosphere.
plus some rescue goats that are trained to sniff survivors out of the rubble in a disaster, should there be a disaster. Disaster goats.
sounds important. -I'm going to make this easy for you.
just use the clippers. Just, you know...
you sure? -Yeah, make me look like Steve McQueen.
I'm a scientist.
not a hippie.
no, olives are a party favor. -When's the last time you got olives as a party favor?
that's 10 points because it's a double word.
Ah! Mexican casserole!
"H." A party favor that begins with "H."
Hookah." -That's a foreign word.
it doesn't count.
sorry I'm late.
I'm cleaning up my act. -Ooh!
you look amazing.
let me touch. Touchy-feely.
Hi, baby.
okay, if everybody's done fawning over Goat Man, hookah is a foreign word, so that's doesn't count.
I'll look it up in the dictionary, the English dictionary, -if you really want to challenge. -Yeah, challenge. Yeah.
Bennet. Bennet, honey, you're going to lose your turn.
hookah, an Oriental tobacco pipe..." -Oriental.
...with a long flexible tube that draws the smoke through the water -"in a tin bowl." -So that's still a foreign word.
no, but it's in the English dictionary.
like "charlatan" is. -Yeah.
or "gigolo
or "fellatio
honey, you lose your turn.
all right, okay.
honey!
Hey, hey, honey.
Hissy," noun.
a fit of anger. Temper tantrum." -Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, you know what, that's the kind of snarky bullshit that Frank used to pull all the time.
my God, you are turning into him. You're turning into him.
wait, are you talking about Fucker Frank?
you know, you never finished telling me that story...
Aubrey! Aubrey! -I know.
well, you want to know more about Fucker Frank, ask Ellis.
he's his new best friend.
and she should know the hell that that man put me through.
and now he sends you an old sweatshirt and everything is hunky-dory?
I bought you a $2, 000 mountain bike, and you don't have the decency to try it out.
I said thank you, like, 100 times. -I didn't hear it.
feelings check. -Did you hear it?
feelings check.
I feel that you might be reacting negatively.
feelings check. Shut the hell up!
you know, marrying that man was the worst decision I have ever made.
why don't you tell Aubrey about the time that you and Frank got in a fight and how you disappeared for six days?
and he had to find you living in a cheap motel?
so? -Or why don't you tell everyone why Frank never visits Tucson anymore?
how you hid the keys to his rental car and made him miss his flight.
okay, I don't need to be attacked by my own son!
fucking genetics!
you are the biggest, selfish prick I have ever met!
bigger than your fucking father!
mister, you are coming with me to Sedona tomorrow, and you are going to do that workshop with Johanna!
Yes, you are! No more fucking goat treks!
good job.
listen, this is a special trek.
we're on a mission of philanthropy.
what do you mean? -We're helping a refugee from Honduras into the United States.
that's illegal, isn't it?
she's a political refugee.
you're joking, right? -No.
my cousin Jesus set it up.
is Jesus real Mexican or fake Mexican, like you?
fake Mexican? What does that mean, fake Mexican?
Yeah, you know how you make everyone call you Javier even though your real name's Stephen and you're Irish-Italian.
I don't make everyone call me Javier.
they just do.
how are we gonna get the goats across the border?
no one's gonna stop us.
getting them to Mexico is no problem, we'll be crossing the desert on the way back.
after we meet Jesus at the Super Puerco, we can party all night.
don't use "party" as a verb. It sounds vulgar.
vulgar in the common, pedestrian sense, not in the obscene sense.
I knew what you meant by "vulgar.
the bar's either to the left or to the right.
that's helpful.
try to look presentable.
like me.
Jesus!
what the fuck do you want?
it's me, Javier. I cleaned up for the trek.
you look like a cop, man.
who's the kid?
this is Ellis. He's good with the goats.
go outside and wait with the goats.
all right.
can we do this in English?
those are the ugliest dogs I've ever seen.
Thanks.
get out of here, please.
sorry about Jesus.
isn't Jesus married with some kids?
those prostitutes were, like, my age.
Where's the refugee? -Hmm?
the refugee?
she had to go back to Tegucigalpa.
family issues.
so this whole thing was a waste of time?
no, this was a good practice run.
you're setting it up in a wash? That's dumb.
they're rain clouds.
if you're so concerned about being spotted, why the hell do you have a bright orange tent?
I'm starving. -Frieda's right there. She's full of milk.
I'm looking for my power bars and I find your sandwich, cheater.
what about Javier's golden rule of goat trekking?
goat milk only. -Hey! Put that back!
Jesus.
this wasn't my idea.
not everyone is as fortunate as you, Ellis.
Wendy and Bennet might kick me out, and I don't have any money!
there never was a refugee, was there?
I swear, you don't know what it's like having to ask Wendy for money.
then get a job like a normal person!
I'm not a normal person.
come on, let's go. Pack up the tent.
we'll camp somewhere else.
let's go.
would you just give me a second?
come on. Get up. -Get your hands off me.
damn it! Lance!
Lance!
goat Man.
goat Man!
goat Man.
goat Man's going to be okay.
Ellis, sweetie! -That goat's not riding in my Jeep.
are you okay?
did Goat Man call?
the healing workshops were great. Thanks for asking.
aren't you even the slightest bit worried about him?
the Hopi shaman at the workshop said that I worry too much.
Yeah, about yourself!
okay, I can't leak my energy right now worrying about Goat Man.
I have been advised to let it pool inward.
Frank and Judy are married and they're having a baby.
he's lying, hon. He's trying to hurt you.
let's go.
okay, I know you're at Gates.
I know you're smart.
you make pretty good decisions.
but I do worry about you.
all the time.
I'm your mother.
and just so you know,
I was on the phone with Johanna and the shaman, and without me telling anything about what happened, the shaman mentioned that Goat Man knows the desert and knows how to survive.
okay?
and notice,
I haven't said anything about Frank or his child bride.
may I please speak to my mother? -Who is this?
how many children does Wendy have?
did he call? -Who?
don't be a prick!
you never even bother to ask about me or your mother. That is rude.
did Goat Man call or not?
well, I have a slight cold, and your mother...
maybe you should have Senor Levy call the police in Mexico and ask -if they've heard anything... -I'm sure Goat Man's fine.
stop whining about him already.
line up, girls!
eat my shit.
quick one.
not bad, Whitman.
did you have PE today?
did you get sweaty?
we should get drunk and go see that, that'd be awesome.
Yeah, sounds like a plan.
nice bike. Is that carbon fiber?
Yeah, I think so.
give it to me.
what?
Ellis!
Ellis.
Oh, no.
come on, sit up.
sit up.
I read To Kill a Mockingbird.
and at first I thought Atticus was sort of self-righteous.
but by the end...
you think there are people like Atticus Finch in real life?
I hope so.
enjoy the Percocets.
Bye.
once you have made a cut around the eyeball, separate the eye into two halves.
let the vitreous humor and any associated structure...
Barney, we're already on step six.
can I finish? This is step seven.
can I finish reading? -I'm already done.
you may need to tease the vitreous humor gently away from the lining of the eye.
I think I'm just gonna cut the retina. Yeah.
that's definitely not the retina.
it doesn't look like you're doing anything right.
I got it. -Wait, no, no, that's the cornea.
no, that's the cornea, you moron.
careful, you don't want to blind that cow forever.
what are you doing here?
I felt like taking a drive, I guess.
what happened to your head?
he got bike-jacked. Four stitches.
by a townie. They hate all Gates students.
what do you mean?
it's fine. It's healing quickly. Where's the photo?
I'd like to introduce you to your new brother,
Gabriel.
he looks like Judy.
actually, he's a dead ringer for you when you were a baby.
you know, it's a known fact that all babies look like old Jewish men.
Oh, boy, go easy on me.
senior year.
it's not as dorky as I thought.
wait, Latin club? Young Historians?
I was only in those for my dad, who was convinced I was too stupid to get into college on grades alone.
Really? -Yeah.
Eldridge said you were a brain. -No.
when I was admitted to Princeton, my father said, "Everyone wins the lottery once. Don't blow this, Frank.
Ellis, do you like it here?
I mean, you know you can go back to Tucson, or you could even come to DC.
there are a lot of good day schools there.
Really? -Yeah.
I like it here, though.
we have our first meet next week.
coach put me on the varsity team. I'm actually pretty fast.
Really?
you lived in Stillwell? -Yeah.
it's all nerds now.
it was all nerds then, too. You saw my yearbook photos.
you think Goat Man's all right?
disappearing for a few months is a very Goat Man thing to do.
what about Wendy? -Why?
I don't know. She seems weird.
she never returns my calls.
she's really into New Age spirituality and freaks out a lot.
well, when I first met her, she was really into The Grateful Dead and she freaked out a lot.
Ellis, I've always had a hard time with your mom, but that's not an excuse.
I'm sorry I've been absent from your life.
Thanks.
I'm sure you've had your fill of the Gates food, so we'll go out for dinner tonight. Barney, too, if he wants.
are you sure you want to invite Barney?
so Yale's application process is really tough, but I've been studying hard, and Ellis has been helping me out a lot, so I think I've got a really good shot of getting in.
but if I don't get into Yale, I'm gonna try for Tufts.
it's a little early to be worrying about college, isn't it?
this isn't the right way to the restaurant.
Yeah, we got a little business to take care of before dinner.
I'll talk reasonably to his parents and if I don't make any progress,
I'll call the police.
hello. -Yes?
I've come to retrieve my son's bicycle.
I believe you assaulted him and...
Mr. Whitman, are you still taking us to dinner?
thanks for coming.
thanks for getting my bike back.
think about Telluride this summer.
Judy would love it if you were there.
I mean, I would, too.
actually, so would your brother if he could distinguish shapes.
I will.
Oh, I almost forgot.
it's a prospectus for my new company.
solar panel technology for vehicles.
I assembled a team of geniuses, aside from myself.
I didn't want you to think I wasn't doing anything.
I'll look through it.
good luck with the race next week.
I'm really proud of you, Ellis.
Thanks.
see you soon.
you got a package.
you're studying history already?
who's it from?
goat Man!
it's from Goat Man!
close the door.
well, of course! Look at what's happening!
bullshit. You're a liar.
you're a liar. You're a big, fat liar. -It's the only thing.
I can't help but think that if you could just corral your energy, just redirect it, -then you wouldn't be doing this. -No matter how I redirect my energy, you will always be a pig.
the jig is up. Leave.
it's disgusting to think... -But I still have to go through with it.
...that you would put... -'Cause I've got to put food in my mouth!
...your slimy penis into me after that. That's disgusting!
get out of my face! -All this...
get out of my face, you slut. -...seems so drastic.
you're a big fat slut. Get out of my face.
if that's what you want, I...
I'm done bankrolling you.
leave. -Yeah, yeah.
runners, take your mark.
Hey.
Hi, there.
what are you doing here so early?
picking up my pathetic check.
I got my bike back.
that's good.
good.
I was thinking, if you wanted to meet me off campus, you could.
I don't think so.
come on, Ellis.
why don't you spend some of that allowance money your parents send you for being the perfect boy?
if you change your mind... -I won't.
grapes of Wrath.
it's my favorite novel.
we gotta get you home.
I think Wendy wants to take you out to dinner for your birthday and maybe show you your birthday present, if you're up for it.
I almost forgot it was my birthday.
you know, when I was little,
I used to love to hear Wendy do a primal screaming.
yeah? -Yeah.
it meant she'd actually be happy for the few days afterwards and play with me.
thank God Bennet's gone.
Yeah, she actually kicked him out. -No?
it was awesome.
you know what else?
she milked Frieda the whole time I was gone.
kept her lactating.
Yeah, exactly.
forty acres.
there'll never be a 7-Eleven or a Wal-Mart out here.
I forget how cool Wendy can be, you know.
I helped pick it out.
that house all the way over there is owned by a surgeon from Canada, eh.
the rest is National Forest land.
it even smells good out here.
this is the coolest birthday present.
Hey.
welcome home spliff?
no, thanks.
I got plenty. Enough for the whole summer.
the greenhouse is going strong.
I was thinking of maybe going to Telluride with Frank and Judy and Gabriel for the summer.
Gabriel?
that's the baby's name, Gabriel?
Yeah.
I think you should go.
I think that would be good for you.
Yeah.
that'll be good for you.

as a IoyaI servant and father of the Empress how can this be possibIe?
inspector Zhan has got a target quotation
how dare you
if I attempt such devious acts
I'm guiIty as charged
as the Economics CounciIor it's imminent that I know aII the existing rates
the quotation is for my reference

so this is Game Theory Economics 159.
if you're here for Art history, you're either in the wrong room or stay anyway, maybe this is the right room.
but this is Game Theory, okay.
you should have four handouts everyone should have four handouts.
there is a legal release form...
we'll talk about it in a minute... about the videoing.
there is a syllabus, which is a preliminary syllabus.
it's also online.
and there are two games labeled game 1 and game 2.
can I get you all to look at game 1 and start thinking about it.
and while you're thinking about it, I am hoping you can multitask a bit.
I'll describe a bit about the class and we'll get a bit of admin under our belts.
but please try and look at... somebody's not looking at it, because they're using it as a fan here...
so look at game 1 and fill out that form for me, okay?
so while you're filling that out, let me tell you a little bit about what we're going to be doing here.
so what is Game Theory?
game Theory is a method of studying strategic situations.
so what's a strategic situation?
well let's start off with what's not a strategic situation.
in your Economics... in your Intro Economics class in 115 or 110, you saw some pretty good examples of situations that were not strategic.
you saw firms working in perfect competition.
firms in perfect competition are price takers they don't particularly have to worry about the actions of their competitors.
you also saw firms that were monopolists and monopolists don't have any competitors to worry about, so that's not a particularly strategic situation.
they're not price takers but they take the demand curve.
is this looking familiar for some of you who can remember doing 115 last year or maybe two years ago for some of you?
everything in between is strategic.
so everything that constitutes imperfect competition is a strategic setting.
think about the motor industry, the motor car industry.
ford has to worry about what GM is doing and what Toyota is doing, and for the moment at least what Chrysler is doing but perhaps not for long.
so there's a small number of firms and their actions affect each other.
so for a literal definition of what strategic means it's a setting where the outcomes that affect you depend on actions, not just on your own actions, but on actions of others.
we're going to come back and see plenty of this over the course of the next semester.
so what I want to do is get on to where this applies.
it obviously applies in Economics, but it also applies in politics, and in fact, this class will count as a Political Science class if you're a Political Science major.
you should go check with the DUS in Political Science.
it count... Game Theory is very important in law these days.
so for those of you... for the half of you...
that are going to end up in law school, this is pretty good training.
game Theory is also used in biology and towards the middle of the semester, we're actually going to see some examples of Game Theory as applied to evolution.
and not surprisingly, Game Theory applies to sport.
so let's talk about a bit of admin.
how are you doing on filling out those games?
everyone managing to multitask. Filling in game 1?
keep writing.
I want to get some admin out of the way and I want to start by getting out of the way what is obviously the elephant in the room.
some of you will have noticed that there's a camera crew here, okay.
so as some of you probably know,
Yale is undergoing an open education project and they're videoing several classes, and the idea of this, is to make educational materials available beyond the walls of Yale.
in fact, on the web, internationally, so people in places, maybe places in the U. S.
or places miles away, maybe in Timbuktu or whatever, who find it difficult to get educational materials from the local university or whatever, can watch certain lectures from Yale on the web.
some of you would have been in classes that do that before.
what's going to different about this class is that you're going to be participating in it.
the way we teach this class is we're going to play games, we're going to have discussions, we're going to talk among the class, and you're going to be learning from each other, and I want you to help people watching at home to be able to learn too.
and that means you're going to be on film, at the very least on mike.
so how's that going to work?
around the room are three T. A.s holding mikes.
let me show you where they are one here, one here, and one here.
when I ask for classroom discussions,
I'm going to have one of the T. A.s go to you with a microphone much like in "Donahue" or something, okay.
at certain times, you're going to be seen on film, so the camera is actually going to come around and point in your direction.
now I really want this to happen.
I had to argue for this to happen, cause I really feel that this class isn't about me.
I'm part of the class obviously, but it's about you teaching each other and participating.
but there's a catch, the catch is, that that means you have to sign that legal release form.
so you'll see that you have in front of you a legal release form,
you have to be able to sign it, and what that says is that we can use you being shown in class.
think of this as a bad hair day release form.
all right, you can't sue Yale later if you had a bad hair day.
for those of you who are on the run from the FBI, your visa has run out, or you're sitting next to your ex-girlfriend, now would be a good time to put a paper bag over your head.
all right, now just to get you used to the idea, in every class we're going to have I think the same two people, so Jude is the cameraman why don't you all wave to Jude this is Jude okay.
and Wes is our audio guy this is Wes.
and I will try and remember not to include Jude and Wes in the classroom discussions, but you should be aware that they're there.
now, if this is making you nervous, if it's any consolation, it's making me very nervous.
so, all right, we'll try and make this class work as smoothly as we can, allowing for this extra thing.
let me just say, no one's making any money off this...
but me and the T. A.s are not being paid.
the aim of this, that I think is a good aim, it's an educational project, and I'm hoping you'll help us with it.
the one difference it is going to mean,
is that at times I might hold some of the discussions for the class, coming down into this part of the room, here, to make it a little easier for Jude.
all right, how are we doing now on filling out those forms?
has everyone filled in their strategy for the first game?
not yet. Okay, let's go on doing a bit more admin.
the thing you mostly care about I'm guessing, is the grades.
all right, so how is the grade going to work for this class?
30% of the class will be on problem sets, 30% of the grade 30% on the mid-term, and 40% on the final so 30/30/40.
the mid-term will be held in class on October 17, that is also in your syllabus.
please don't anybody tell me late... any time after today, you didn't know when the mid-term was and therefore it clashes with 17 different things
the mid-term is on October 17, which is a Wednesday, in class.
all right, the problem sets there will be roughly ten problem sets and I'll talk about them more later on when I hand them out.
the first one will go out on Monday but it will be due ten days later.
roughly speaking they'll be every week.
the grade distribution all right, so this is the rough grade distribution.
roughly speaking, a sixth of the class are going to end up with A's, a sixth are going to end up with A-, a sixth are going to end up with B+, a sixth are going to end up with B, a sixth are going to end up with B-, and the remaining sixth, if I added that up right, are going to end up with what I guess we're now calling the presidential grade, is that right?
that's not literally true.
so actually slightly fewer than a sixth will get straight A's,
and fewer than a sixth will get C's and below.
we'll squeeze the middle to make them be more B's.
one thing I can guarantee from past experience in this class, is that the median grade will be a B+.
the median will fall somewhere in the B+'s.
just as forewarning for people who have forgotten what a median is, that means half of you... not approximately half,
it means exactly half of you will be getting something like B+ and below and half will get something like B+ and above.
now, how are you doing in filling in the forms?
everyone filled them in yet?
surely must be pretty close to getting everyone filled in.
all right, so last things to talk about before I actually collect them in... textbooks.
there are textbooks for this class.
the main textbook is this one, Dutta's book "Strategies and Games."
if you want a slightly tougher book, more rigorous book, try Joel Watson's book, "Strategies."
both of those books are available at the bookstore.
but I want to warn everybody ahead of time,
I will not be following the textbook.
I regard these books as safety nets.
if you don't understand something that happened in class, you want to reinforce an idea that came up in class, then you should read the relevant chapters in the book and the syllabus will tell you which chapters to read for each class, or for each week of class, all right.
but I will not be following these books religiously at all.
in fact, they're just there as back up.
in addition, I strongly recommend people read, "Thinking strategically."
this is good bedtime reading.
do any of you suffer from insomnia?
it's very good bedtime reading if you suffer from insomnia.
it's a good book and what's more there's going to be a new edition of this book this year
and Norton have allowed us to get advance copies of it.
so if you don't buy this book this week,
I may be able to make the advance copy of the new edition available for some of you next week.
I'm not taking a cut on that either, all right, there's no money changing hands.
all right, sections are on the syllabus sign up...
sorry on the website, sign up as usual.
put yourself down on the wait list if you don't get into the section you want.
you probably will get into the section you want once we're done.
all right, now we must be done with the forms. Are we done with the forms?
all right, so why don't we send the T. A.s, with or without mikes, up and down the aisles and collect in your game 1, not game 2, just game 1.
just while we're doing that,
I think the reputation of this class... I think...
if you look at the course evaluations online or whatever, is that this class is reasonably hard but reasonably fun.
so I'm hoping that's what the reputation of the class is.
if you think this class is going to be easy,
I think it isn't actually an easy class.
it's actually quite a hard class, but I think I can guarantee it's going to be a fun class.
now one reason it's a fun class, is the nice thing about teaching Game Theory...
quieten down folks... one thing about teaching Game Theory is you get to play games, and that's exactly what we've just been doing now.
this is our first game and we're going to play games throughout the course, sometimes several times a week, sometimes just once a week.
we got all these things in?
everyone handed them in?
so I need to get those counted. Has anyone taken the Yale accounting class?
no one wants to... has aspirations to be... one person has.
I'll have a T. A. do it, it's all right, we'll have a T. A. do it.
so Kaj, can you count those for me? Is that right?
let me read out the game you've just played.
game 1, a simple grade scheme for the class.
read the following carefully.
without showing your neighbor what you are doing, put it in the box below either the letter Alpha or the letter Beta.
think of this as a grade bid.
I will randomly pair your form with another form and neither you nor your pair will ever know with whom you were paired.
here's how the grades may be assigned for the class.
well they won't be, but we can pretend.
if you put Alpha and you're paired with Beta, then you will get an A and your pair a C.
if you and your pair both put Alpha, you'll both get B-.
if you put Beta and you're paired with Alpha, you'll get a C and your pair an A.
if you and your pair both put Beta, then you'll both get B+.
so that's the thing you just filled in.
now before we talk about this, let's just collect this information in a more useful way.
we'll discuss this in a second, but why don't we actually record what the game is, that we're playing, first.
so this is our grade game, and what I'm going to do, since it's kind of hard to absorb all the information just by reading a paragraph of text,
I'm going to make a table to record the information.
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put me here, and my pair, the person I'm randomly paired with here, and Alpha and Beta, which are the choices I'm going to make here
and on the columns Alpha and Beta, the choices my pair is making.
in this table, I'm going to put my grades.
so my grade if we both put Alpha is B-, if we both put Beta, was B+.
if I put Alpha and she put a Beta, I got an A, and if I put Beta and she put an Alpha, I got a C.
is that correct? That's more or less right?
Yeah, okay while we're here, why don't we do the same for my pair?
so this is my grades on the left hand table, but now let's look at what my pair will do, what my pair will get.
so I should warn the people sitting at the back that my handwriting is pretty bad, that's one reason for moving forward.
the other thing I should apologize at this stage of the class is my accent.
I will try and improve the handwriting, there's not much I can do about the accent at this stage.
so once again if you both put Alpha then my pair gets a B-.
if we both put Beta, then we both get a B+;
in particular, my pair gets a B+.
if I put Alpha and my pair puts Beta, then she gets a C.
and if I put Beta and she puts Alpha, then she gets an A.
so I now have all the information that was on the sheet of paper that you just handed in.
now there's another way of organizing this that's standard in Game Theory, so we may as well get used to it now on the first day.
rather than drawing two different tables like this, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the second table and super-impose it on top of the first table.
okay, so let me do that and you'll see what I mean.
what I'm going to do is draw a larger table, the same basic structure:
I'm choosing Alpha and Beta on the rows, my pair is choosing Alpha and Beta on the columns, but now I'm going to put both grades in.
so the easy ones are on the diagonal:
you both get B- if we both choose Alpha;
we both get B+ if we both choose Beta.
but if I choose Alpha and my pair chooses Beta,
I get an A and she gets a C.
and if I choose Beta and she chooses Alpha, then it's me who gets the C and it's her who gets the A.
so notice what I did here.
the first grade corresponds to the row player, me in this case, and the second grade in each box corresponds to the column player, my pair in this case.
so this is a nice succinct way of recording what was in the previous two tables.
this is an outcome matrix;
this tells us everything that was in the game.
this is very interesting.
okay, so now seems a good time to start talking about what people did.
so let's just have a show of hands. How many of you chose Alpha?
leave your hands up so that Jude can catch that, so people can see at home, okay.
all right and how many of you chose Beta?
there's far more Alphas... Wave your hands the Beta's okay.
all right, there's a Beta here, okay.
so it looks like a lot of... Well we're going to find out, we're going to count but a lot more Alpha's than Beta's.
let me try and find out some reasons why people chose.
so let me have the Alpha's up again.
so, the woman who's in red here, can we get a mike to the... yeah, is it okay if we ask you?
you're not on the run from the FBI? We can ask you why?
okay, so you chose Alpha right? So why did you choose Alpha?
I realized that my partner chose Alpha, therefore I chose.
all right, so you wrote out these squares, you realized what your partner was going to do, and responded to that.
any other reasons for choosing Alpha around the room?
can we get the woman here?
try not to be intimidated by these microphones, they're just mikes. it's okay.
the reason I chose Alpha, regardless of what my partner chose,
I think there would be better outcomes than choosing Beta.
all right, so let me ask your names for a second... so your name was?
Courtney.
Courtney and your name was?
Clara Elise.
Clara Elise. So slightly different reasons, same choice Alpha.
Clara Elise's reason... what did Clara Elise say?
she said, no matter what the other person does, she reckons she'd get a better grade if she chose Alpha.
so hold that thought a second, we'll come back to...
is it Clara Elise, is that right?
we'll come back to Clara Elise in a second.
let's talk to the Beta's a second; let me just emphasize at this stage there are no wrong answers.
later on in the class there'll be some questions that have wrong answers.
right now there's no wrong answers.
there may be bad reasons but there's no wrong answers.
so let's have the Beta's up again. Let's see the Beta's.
Oh come on!
there was a Beta right here. You were a Beta right?
you backed off the Beta, okay.
so how can I get a mike into a Beta?
let's stick in this aisle a bit.
is that a Beta right there?
I... are you a Beta right there?
can I get the Beta in here? Is that possible?
in here... you can leave your hand so that... there we go.
just point towards... that's fine, just speak into it, that's fine.
so the reason right?
Yeah, go ahead.
I personally don't like swings that much and it's the B-/B+ range, so I'd much rather prefer that to a swing from A to C, and that's my reason.
all right, so you're saying it compresses the range.
I'm not sure it does compress the range.
I mean if you chose Alpha, you're swinging from A to B-;
and from Beta, swinging from B+ to C.
I mean those are similar kind of ranges but it certainly is a reason.
other reasons for choosing?
Yeah, the guy in blue here, yep, good.
that's all right. Don't hold the mike;
just let it point at you, that's fine.
well I guess I thought we could be more collusive and kind of work together, but I guess not.
so I chose Beta.
there's a siren in the background so I missed the answer.
stand up a second, so we can just hear you.
sorry, say again.
sure. My name is Travis.
I thought we could work together, but I guess not.
all right good. That's a pretty good reason.
if you had chosen Beta we would have all gotten B+'s but I guess not.
good, so Travis is giving us a different reason, right?
he's saying that maybe, some of you in the room might actually care about each other's grades, right?
I mean you all know each other in class.
you all go to the same college.
for example, if we played this game up in the Business School...
are there any MBA students here today?
one or two. If we play this game up in the Business School,
I think it's quite likely we're going to get a lot of Alpha's chosen, right?
but if we played this game up in let's say the Divinity School.
all right and I'm guessing that Travis' answer is reflecting what you guys are reasoning here.
if you played in the divinity school, you might think that people in the divinity school might care about other people's grades, right?
there might be ethical reasons... perfectly good, sensible, ethical reasons... for choosing Beta in this game.
there might be other reasons as well, but that's perhaps the reason to focus on.
and perhaps, the lesson I want to draw out of this is that right now this is not a game.
right now we have actions, strategies for people to take, and we know what the outcomes are, but we're missing something that will make this a game.
what are we missing here?
objectives.
we're missing objectives. We're missing payoffs.
we're missing what people care about, all right.
so we can't really start analyzing a game until we know what people care about, and until we know what the payoffs are.
now let's just say something now, which I'll probably forget to say in any other moment of the class, but today it's relevant.
game Theory, me, professors at Yale, cannot tell you what your payoff should be.
I can't tell you in a useful way what it is that your goals in life should be or whatever.
that's not what Game Theory is about.
however, once we know what your payoffs are, once we know what your goals are, perhaps Game Theory can you help you get there.
so we've had two different kinds of payoffs mentioned here.
we had the kind of payoff where we care about our own grade, and Travis has mentioned the kind of payoff where you might care about other people's grades.
and what we're going to do today is analyze this game under both those possible payoffs.
to start that off, let's put up some possible payoffs for the game.
and I promise we'll come back and look at some other payoffs later.
we'll revisit the Divinity School later.
all right, so here once again is our same matrix with me and my pair, choosing actions Alpha and Beta,
and some of you will perhaps recognize these numbers, but that's not really relevant for now.
all right, so what's the idea here?
well the first idea is that these numbers represent utiles or utilities.
they represent what these people are trying to maximize, what they're to achieve, their goals.
the idea is... just to compare this to the outcome matrix...
is for the person who's me here, yields a payoff of... is this box...
so yields a payoff of three, whereas yields a payoff of 0, and so on.
so what's the interpretation?
it's the first interpretation:
the natural interpretation that a lot of you jumped to straight away, these are people... people with these payoffs are people...
who only care about their own grades.
they prefer an A to a B+, they prefer a B+ to a B-, and they prefer a B- to a C. Right,
I'm hoping I... the grades in order, otherwise it's going to ruin my curve at the end of the year.
so these people only care about their own grades.
they only care about their own grades.
what do we call people who only care about their own grades?
what's a good technical term for them?
in England, I think we refer to these guys...
whether it's technical or not... as "evil gits."
these are not perhaps the most moral people in the universe.
so now we can ask a different question.
suppose, whether these are actually your payoffs or not, pretend they are for now.
suppose these are all payoffs.
now we can ask, not what did you do, but what should you do?
now we have payoffs that can really switch the question to a normative question: what should you do?
what should you do?
let's come back to... was it Clara Elise...
where was Clara Elise before?
let's get the mike on you again.
so just explain what you did and why again.
why I chose Alpha?
Yeah, stand up a second, if that's okay.
okay.
more or less, you were caring about your grades.
Yeah, I was thinking why did you choose Alpha?
I'm sorry?
why did you choose Alpha?
just repeat what you said before.
because I thought the payoffs...
the two different payoffs that I could have gotten...
were highest if I chose Alpha.
good; so what Clara Elise is saying... it's an important idea... is this...
or less what you're saying:
is no matter what the other person does, no matter what the pair does, she obtains a higher payoff by choosing Alpha.
let's just see that.
if the pair chooses Alpha and she chooses Alpha, then she gets 0.
if the pair chooses Alpha and she chose Beta, she gets -1. 0 is bigger than -1.
if the pair chooses Beta, then if she chooses Alpha she gets 3,
beta she gets 1, and 3 is bigger than 1.
so in both cases, no matter what the other person does, she receives a higher payoff from choosing Alpha, so she should choose Alpha.
does everyone follow that line of reasoning?
that's a stronger line of reasoning than the reasoning we had earlier.
so the woman, I have immediately forgotten the name of, in the red shirt, whose name was...
Courtney.
Courtney, so Courtney also gave a reason for choosing Alpha, and it was a perfectly good reason for choosing Alpha, nothing wrong with it, but notice that this reason's a stronger reason.
it kind of implies your reason.
so let's get some definitions down here.
I think I can fit it in here.
let's try and fit it in here.
definition:
we say that my strategy
alpha strictly dominates my strategy Beta, if my payoff from Alpha is strictly greater than that from Beta, and this is the key part of the definition, regardless of what others do.
shall we just read that back?
we say that my strategy Alpha strictly dominates my strategy Beta, if my payoff from Alpha is strictly greater than that from Beta, regardless of what others do.
now it's by no means my main aim in this class to teach you jargon.
but a few bits of jargon are going to be helpful in allowing the conversation to move forward and this is certainly one.
evil gits" is maybe one too, but this is certainly one.
let's draw out some lessons from this.
actually, so you can still read that, let me bring down and clean this board.
so the first lesson of the class, and there are going to be lots of lessons, is a lesson that emerges immediately from the definition of a dominated strategy and it's this.
so lesson one of the course is:
do not play a strictly dominated strategy.
so with apologies to Strunk and White, this is in the passive form, that's dominated, passive voice.
do not play a strictly dominated strategy.
Why?
somebody want to tell me why?
do you want to get this guy?
stand up... yeah.
because everyone's going to pick the dominant outcome and then everyone's going to get the worst result...
the collectively worst result.
Yeah, that's a possible answer.
I'm looking for something more direct here.
so we look at the definition of a strictly dominated strategy.
I'm saying never play one.
what's a possible reason for that?
let's... can we get the woman there?
you'll always lose.
well, I don't know: it's not about winning and losing.
what else could we have?
could we get this guy in the pink down here?
well, the payoffs are lower.
the payoffs are lower, okay.
so here's an abbreviated version of that,
I mean it's perhaps a little bit longer.
the reason I don't want to play a strictly dominated strategy is, if instead,
I play the strategy that dominates it,
I do better in every case.
the reason I never want to play a strictly dominated strategy is, if instead I play the strategy that dominates it,
now that's a pretty convincing argument.
that sounds like a convincing argument.
it sounds like too obvious even to be worth stating in class, so let me now try and shake your faith a little bit in this answer.
you're somebody who's wanted by the FBI, right?
okay, so how about the following argument?
look at the payoff matrix again and suppose I reason as follows.
suppose I reason and say if we, me and my pair, both reason this way and choose Alpha then we'll both get 0.
but if we both reasoned a different way and chose Beta,
then we'll both get 1.
so I should choose Beta: 1 is bigger than 0, I should choose Beta.
what's wrong with that argument?
my argument must be wrong because it goes against the lesson of the class and the lessons of the class are gospel right, they're not wrong ever, so what's wrong with that argument?
Yes, Ale... yeah good.
well because you have to be able to agree, you have to be able to speak to them but we aren't allowed to show our partners what we wrote.
all right, so it involves some notion of agreeing.
so certainly part of the problem here, with the reasoning I just gave you...the reasoning that said
I should choose Beta, because if we both reason the same way, we both do better that way...involves some kind of magical reasoning.
reason myself to choosing Beta, is that what it's called?
the X-Men right?
now in fact, this may come as a surprise to you, I don't have esp,
I'm not a character out of the X-Men, and so you can't actually see brain waves emitting from my head, and my reasoning doesn't affect your reasoning.
so if I did reason that way, and chose Beta,
I'm not going to affect your choice one way or the other.
that's the first thing that's wrong with that reasoning.
what else is wrong with that reasoning?
Yeah, that guy down here.
well, the second that you choose Beta then someone's going...
it's in someone's best interest to take advantage of it.
all right, so someone's going to take advantage of me, but even more than that, an even stronger argument:
that's true, but even a stronger argument.
well how about this?
even if I was that guy in the X-Men or the Matrix or whatever it was, who could reason his way into making people do things.
even if I could make everyone in the room choose Beta by the force of my brain waves, what should I then do?
I should choose Alpha.
if these are my payoffs I should go ahead and choose Alpha because that way I end up getting 3.
so there's two things wrong with the argument.
one, there's this magical reasoning aspect, my reasoning is controlling your actions.
that doesn't happen in the real world.
and two, even if that was the case I'd do better to myself choose Alpha.
so, nevertheless, there's an element of truth in what I just said.
it's the fact that there's an element of truth in it that makes it seem like a good argument.
the element of truth is this.
it is true that by both choosing Alpha we both ended up with B-'s.
we both end up with payoffs of 0, rather than payoffs of 1.
it is true that by both choosing, by both following this lesson and not choosing the dominated strategy Beta, we ended up with payoffs, , that were bad.
and that's probably the second lesson of the class.
so lesson 2, and this lesson probably wouldn't be worth stating, if it wasn't for sort of a century of thought and economics that said the opposite.
so rational choice in this case, people not choosing a dominated strategy;
people choosing a dominant strategy.
rational choice can lead to outcomes that...
what do Americans call this?
that suck.
if you want a more technical term for that, and you remember this from economics 115, it can lead to outcomes that are "inefficient," that are "pareto inefficient," but "suck" will do for today.
rational choices by rational players, can lead to bad outcomes.
so this is a famous example for this reason.
it's a good illustration of this point.
it's a famous example.
what's the name of this example, somebody?
this is called Prisoner's Dilemma.
how many of you have heard of the Prisoner's Dilemma before?
most of you saw it in 115, why is it called the Prisoner's Dilemma?
Yes, the guy here in orange.
that's okay; he can just point at you that's fine.
I think it's whether or not the prisoner's cooperate in the sentence they have, and if they kind of rat out the other person, then they can have less; but if both rat out, then they like end up losing large scale.
good, so in the standard story you've got these two crooks, or two accused crooks, and they're in separate cells and they're being interviewed separately... kept apart... and they're both told that if neither of them rats the other guy out, they'll go to jail for say a year.
if they both rat each other out, they'll end up in jail for two years, but if you rat the other guy out and he doesn't rat you out, then you will go home free and he'll go to jail for five years.
put that all down and you pretty quickly see that, regardless whether the other guy rats you or not, you're better off ratting him out.
now, if you have never seen that Prisoner's Dilemma, you can see it pretty much every night on a show called "Law & Order."
how many of you have seen "Law & Order"?
if you haven't seen Law & Order, the way to see "Law & Order" is to go to a random tv set, at a random time, and turn on a random channel.
this happens in every single episode,
so much so that if any of you actually...
I mean this might actually be true at Yale...
but if you any of you or the tv guys:
if any of you know the guy who writes the plots for this, have him come to the class, so I guess to see the video now, and we get some better plot lines in there.
but, of course, that's not the only example.
the grade game and this is not the only example.
there are lots of examples of Prisoner's Dilemmas out there.
let's try and find some other ones.
so how many of you have roommates in your college?
how many of you have roommates?
most of you have roommates right?
so I'm guessing now, I won't make you show your hands, because it's probably embarrassing, but what is the state of your dorm rooms, your shared dorm rooms, at the end of the semester or the end of the school year?
so I'm just guessing, having been in a few of these things over the years, that by the end of the semester, or certainly by the end of the school year, the state of the average Yale dorm room is quite disgusting.
why is it disgusting?
it's disgusting because people don't tidy up.
they don't clean up those bits of pizza and bits of chewed bread and cheese, but why don't they tidy up?
well let's just work it out.
what would you like to happen if you're sharing a dorm room?
you'd like to have the other guy tidy up, right?
the best thing for you is to have the other guy tidy up and the worst thing for you is to tidy up for the other guy.
but now work it out: it's a Prisoner's Dilemma.
if the other guy doesn't tidy up, you're best off not tidying up either, because the last thing you want is to be tidying up for the other guy.
and if the other guy does tidy up, hey the room's clean, who cares?
so either way, you're not going to tidy up and you end up with a typical Yale dorm room.
am I being unfair?
are your dorm rooms all perfect?
this may be a gender thing but we're not going to go there.
so there are lots of Prisoner's Dilemmas out there,
anyone got any other examples?
other examples?
I didn't quite hear that, sorry.
let's try and get a mike on it so we can really hear it.
inaudible.
okay, in divorce struggles, okay.
you're too young to be worrying about such things but never mind.
Yeah, okay, that's a good example.
all right, hiring lawyers, bringing in big guns.
what about an economics example?
what about firms who are competing in prices?
both firms have an incentive to undercut the other firm, driving down profits for both.
the last thing you want is to have the other firm undercut you, in an attempt to push prices down.
that's good for us the consumers, but bad for the firm, bad for industry profit.
what remedies do we see?
we'll come back to this later on in the class, but let's have a preview.
so what remedies do we see in society for Prisoner's Dilemmas?
what kind of remedies do we see?
let me try and get the guy here right in front.
collusion.
collusion; so firms could collude.
so what prevents them from colluding?
one thing they could do, presumably, is they could write a contract, these firms.
they could say I won't lower my prices if you don't lower your prices, and they could put this contract in with the pricy lawyer, who's taking a day off from the divorce court, and that would secure that they wouldn't lower prices on each other.
is that right?
so why wouldn't that work?
why wouldn't writing a contract here work?
it's against the law.
it's an illegal contract.
what about you with your roommates?
how many of you have a written contract, stuck with a magnet on the fridge, telling you, when you're supposed to tidy up.
very few of you.
why do you manage to get some cooperation between you and your roommates even without a written contract?
it's not legally enforceable.
well it probably is legally enforceable actually.
this guy says not, but it probably is legally enforceable.
he probably could have a written contract about tidying up.
the woman in here.
repetition; you do it over and over.
Yeah, so maybe even among your roommates, maybe you don't need a contract because you can manage to achieve the same ends, by the fact that you're going to be interacting with the same person, over and over again during your time at Yale.
so we'll come back and revisit the idea that repeating an interaction may allow you to obtain cooperation, but we're not going to come back to that until after the mid-term.
that's way down the road but we'll get there.
now one person earlier on had mentioned something about communication.
I think it was somebody in the front, right?
so let's just think about this a second.
is communication the problem here?
is the reason people behave badly... I don't know "badly..."
people choose Alpha in this game here, is it the fact that they can't communicate?
suppose you'd been able to talk before hand, so suppose the woman here whose name was?
Mary.
Mary, had been able to talk to the person next to her whose name is?
Erica. And they said, suppose we know we're going to be paired together, I'll choose Beta if you choose Beta.
would that work?
why wouldn't that work?
there's no enforcement.
there's no enforcement.
so it isn't a failure of communication per se.
a contract is more than communication, a contract is communication with teeth.
it actually changes the payoffs.
so I could communicate with Alice on agreements, all the better if he's choosing Beta.
so we'll come back and talk about more of these things as the course goes on, but let's just come back to the two we forgot there:
so the collusion case and the case back in "Law & Order" with the prisoners in the cell.
how do they enforce their contracts?
they don't always rat each other out and some firms manage to collude?
how do they manage to enforce those contracts?
those agreements, how are they enforced?
they trust each other.
it could be they trust each other, although if you trust a crook that's not, what else could it be?
the guy here again with the beard, yeah.
could be a zero-sum game.
well, but this is the game.
so here's the game.
no, but the pay, the way they value, the way of valuing each...
okay, so the payoffs may be different.
I have something simpler in mind.
suppose they have a written contract, or even an unwritten contract, what enforces the contract for colluding firms or crooks in jail?
Yeah.
gets off Scott free in five years when the other guy gets out, he might run into a situation where...
Yeah, so a short version of that is, it's a different kind of contract.
if you rat someone out in jail, someone puts a contract out on you.
Tony Soprano enforces those contracts.
that's the purpose of Tony Soprano.
it's the purpose of the Mafia.
the reason the Mafia thrives in countries where it's hard to write legal contracts...
let's say some new parts of the former Soviet Union or some parts of Africa...
the reason the Mafia thrives in those environments, is that it substitutes for the law and enforces both legal and illegal contracts.
so I promised a while ago now, that we were going to come back and look at this game under some other possible payoffs.
so I wasn't under a contract but let's come back and fulfill that promise anyway.
so we're going to revisit, if not the Divinity School, at least in people who have more morality than my friends up in the Business School.
we're going to ask for the same grade game we played at the beginning.
what would happen if player's payoffs looked different?
so these are possible payoffs.
I'll give these a name.
we called the other guys "evil gits."
we'll call these guys "indignant angels."
I can never spell indignant...
is that roughly right?
does that look right?
I think it's right.
In-dig-nant isn't it: indignant.
indignant angels, and we'll see why in a second.
so here are their payoffs and once again the basic structure of the game hasn't changed.
it's still I'm choosing Alpha and Beta, my pair is choosing Alpha and Beta, and the grades are the same as they were before.
they're hidden by that board but you saw them before.
but this time the payoffs are as follows.
on the lead diagonal we still have and .
but now the grades here are -1... I'm sorry...
the payoffs are -1 and -3, and here they're -3 and -1.
what's the idea here?
these aren't the only other possible payoffs.
it's just an idea.
suppose I get an A and my pair gets a C, then sure I get that initial payoff of 3, but unfortunately I can't sleep at night
I have some kind of moral conscience and after I've subtracted off my guilt feelings I end up at -1, so think of this as guilt: some notion of morality.
conversely, if I chose a Beta and my pair chooses an Alpha, so I end up with a C and she ends up with an A, then you know I have a bad time explaining to my parents why I got a C in this class, and I have to say about how I'm going to be president anyway.
but then, in addition, I feel indignation against this person.
it isn't just that I got a C;
I got a c because she made me get a C, so that moral indignation takes us down to -3.
but just another possibility to look at.
so suppose these were the payoffs in the game.
again, suspend disbelief a second and imagine that these actually are your payoffs, and let me ask you what you would have done in this case.
so think about it a second.
write it down.
write down what you're going to do on the corner of your notepad.
just write down an Alpha or Beta: what you're going to do here.
you're not all writing.
the guy in the England shirt isn't writing.
you've got to be writing if you are in an England shirt.
show it to your neighbor.
let's have a show of hands, again I want you to keep your hands up so that Jude can see it now.
so how many of you chose Alpha in this case?
raise your hands. Come on, don't be shy.
raise your hands.
how many chose Beta in this case?
how many people abstained?
not allowed to abstain: let's try it again.
alpha in this case?
no abstentions here.
beta in this case?
so we're roughly splitting the room.
someone who chose Alpha?
again, raise the Alpha's again.
let me get this guy here.
so why did you choose Alpha?
you would minimize your losses;
you'd get 0 or -1 instead of -3 or 1.
all right, so this gentleman is saying...
there's no dominant strategy so... - Right, so this gentleman's saying, a good reason for choosing Alpha in this game is it's less risky.
the worst case scenario is less bad, is a way of saying it.
what about somebody who chose Beta?
a lot of you chose Beta.
let's have a show of hands on the Beta's again.
let me see the Beta's again.
so, raise your hands.
can we get the woman here?
can we ask her why she chose Beta?
because if you choose Alpha, the best case scenario is you get 0, so that's...
okay good, that's a good counter argument.
so the gentleman here was looking at the worst case scenario, and the woman here was looking at the best case scenario.
and the best case scenario here looks like getting a 1 here.
now, let's ask a different question.
is one of the strategies dominated in this game?
no, neither strategy is dominated.
let's just check.
if my pair chooses Alpha, then my choosing Alpha yields 0, Beta -3:
so Alpha would be better.
but if my pair chooses Beta then Alpha yields -1,
beta yields 1: in this case Beta would be better.
so Alpha in this case is better against Alpha, and Beta is better against Beta, but neither dominates each other.
so here's a game where we just change the payoffs.
we have the same basic structure, the same outcomes, but we imagine people cared about different things and we end up with a very different answer.
in the first game, it was kind of clear that we should choose Alpha and here it's not at all clear what we can do... what we should do.
in fact, this kind of game has a name and we'll revisit it later on in the semester.
this kind of game is called a "Coordination Problem."
we'll talk about coordination problems later on.
the main lesson I want to get out of this for today, is a simpler lesson.
it's the lesson that payoffs matter.
we change the payoffs, we change what people cared about, and we get a very different game with a very different outcome.
so the basic lesson is that payoffs matter, but let me say it a different way.
so without giving away my age too much... I guess it will actually...
when I was a kid growing up in England, there was this guy... there was a pop star... a slightly post-punk pop star called Joe Jackson, who none of you would have heard of, because you were all about ten years old, my fault.
and Joe Jackson had this song which had the lyric, something like, you can't get what you want unless you know what you want.
as a statement of logic, that's false.
it could be that what you want just drops into your lap without you knowing about it.
but as a statement of strategy, it's a pretty good idea.
it's a good idea to try and figure out what your goals are...
what you're trying to achieve... before you go ahead and analyze the game.
so payoffs matter.
let's put it in his version.
you can't get what you want, till you know what you want.
be honest, how many of you have heard of Joe Jackson?
that makes me feel old, oh man, okay.
goes down every year.
so far we've looked at this game as played by people who are evil gits, and we've looked at this game as played by people who are indignant angels.
but we can do something more interesting.
we can imagine playing this game on a sort of mix and match.
for example, imagine... this shouldn't be hard for most of you... imagine that you are an evil git, but you know that the person you're playing against is an indignant angel.
so again, imagine that you know you're an evil git, but you know that the person you're playing against or with, is an indignant angel.
what should you do in that case?
what should we do?
who thinks you should choose Alpha in that case?
let's pan the room again if we can.
keep your hands up so that you can see.
who thinks you should choose Beta in that case?
who's abstaining here?
not allowed to abstain in this class: it's a complete no-no.
okay, we'll allow some abstention in the first day but not beyond today.
let's have a look.
let's analyze this combined game.
so what does this game look like?
it's an evil git versus an indignant angel and we can put the payoff matrix together by combining the matrices we had before.
so in this case, this is me as always.
this is my pair, the column player.
my payoffs are going to be what?
my payoffs are going to be evil-git payoffs, so they come from the matrix up there.
so if someone will just help me reading it off there.
that's a 0, a 3, a -1, and a 1.
my opponent or my partner's payoffs come from the indignant angel matrix.
so they come from here. There's a 0, a -3, a -1, and a 1.
everyone see how I constructed that?
so just to remind you again, the first payoff is the row player's payoff, in this case the evil git.
and the second payoff is the column player's payoff, in this case the indignant angel.
now we've set it up as a matrix, let's try again that question I asked before.
suppose you're the row player here.
you're the evil git.
those are your payoffs.
you're playing against an indignant angel, what would you do?
so once again, no abstentions this time: who would choose Alpha?
let's have a show of hands again, keep your hands up a second.
who would choose Beta?
very few Beta's, but mostly Alpha's.
alpha, I think, is the right answer here but why?
why is Alpha the right answer here?
Yeah, can we get this guy here?
it's the dominant strategy.
good.
actually nothing has changed from the game we started with.
the fact that I changed the other guy's payoffs didn't matter here.
alpha was dominant before... it dominated Beta before...
and it still dominates Beta.
let's just check.
if my opponent chooses Alpha and I choose Alpha, I get 0; Beta, I get -1.
so Alpha would be better.
if my opponent chooses Beta and I choose Alpha, I get 3; Beta, I get 1.
once again Alpha is better.
so as before, Alpha does better than Beta for me, regardless of what the other person does.
alpha dominates Beta.
what was the first lesson of the class?
shout it out please.
right, so you should all have been choosing in this game, you all should have chosen Alpha.
so the one person who didn't we'll let him off for today.
so Alpha dominates Beta here.
let's flip things around.
suppose now... harder to imagine, but let's try it... suppose now that you are an indignant angel and you're playing against, and you know this, you're playing against an evil git.
you're an indignant angel, so you have the payoffs that are still there and you're playing against an evil git, which is the payoffs we covered up but we'll reproduce them.
let's produce that matrix.
by the way, if this is beginning to sound like a wrestling match,
I don't mean it to.
let's try here: Alpha, Beta, Alpha, Beta, pair, me.
so my payoffs this time, are the indignant angel payoffs.
so mine are 0, -1, -3, and 1.
and my opponent's payoffs are what would have been my payoffs before.
they come from the other matrix.
let's just show you it.
they come from this matrix.
so they're going to be 0, -1, 3, 1.
I took the second payoff from that matrix and made it the second payoff in this matrix.
everyone see how I did that?
once again, the row player is the first payoff and the column player is the other payoff.
what should you do in this case?
you're the indignant angel.
you're playing against this evil git.
what should you do?
write down on your notepad what you should do.
show it to your neighbor so you can't cheat, or you can cheat but you'll be shamed in front of your neighbor.
raise your hands.
let Jude see it.
raise your hands and keep them up if you chose Alpha now.
how about if you chose Beta now?
so one or two Beta's, mostly Alpha's.
well let's see.
let's reason this through a second.
does my Alpha dominate my Beta?
no, in fact, Alpha doesn't dominate Beta for me.
it doesn't dominate Beta.
if my pair chooses Alpha then Alpha gets me 0; Beta -3.
so Alpha does better.
but if my pair chooses Beta, then Alpha gets me -1; Beta gets me 1.
in this case Beta is better.
as we saw before, Alpha is better against Alpha.
beta is better against Beta.
there's no dominance going on here.
nevertheless, at least 90% of you chose Alpha here, and that's the right answer.
Why?
why should you choose Alpha here?
somebody can we get the guy with the beard here?
wait for the mike, great.
we had acknowledged that Alpha is a dominant strategy for my opponent so we must choose based upon, or knowing that my partner is going to choose Alpha.
good, and your name is?
Henry.
Henry.
so Henry is saying sure I don't have a dominated strategy.
my Alpha doesn't dominate my Beta.
but look at my opponent.
my opponent's Alpha dominates her Beta.
if I choose Alpha and she chooses Alpha to get 0;
beta she gets -1.
alpha is better.
if I choose Beta, if she chooses Alpha she gets 3; Beta 1.
again Alpha is better.
for my opponent, Alpha dominates Beta.
so by thinking about my opponent, by putting myself in my opponent's shoes,
I realize that she has a dominant strategy, Alpha.
she's going to choose Alpha and my best response against Alpha is to choose Alpha myself.
so here, this time, my Alpha does not dominate Beta but my pair's choice of Alpha dominates her choice, her possible choice of Beta.
so she will choose...
she will choose Alpha.
and once I know that she's going to choose Alpha, it's clear that I should choose Alpha and get 0 rather than Beta and get -3.
so I should choose Alpha also.
okay, so now we've seen four different combinations.
we've seen a case where an evil git was playing an evil git;
where an indignant angel was playing an indignant angel;
and we've seen both the flips of those:
the evil git versus the indignant angel;
and the indignant angel against the evil git.
why are we doing this?
because there's an important lesson here.
what's the lesson here?
the lesson is... comes from this game... that a great way to analyze games, a great way to get used to the idea of strategic thinking, perhaps even the essence of strategic thinking, is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, figure out what their payoffs are, and try and figure out what they're going to do.
so the big lesson of this game is...
I forgot what number we're up too
I guess this is lesson 4 I think.
lesson 4 is:
put yourself in others' shoes and try to figure out what they will do.
in a sense, this is the first difficult lesson of the class.
it's easy to spot when a strategy is dominant, more or less.
it's pretty easy to figure out, you have to know about your own payoffs.
but the hard thing in life, is getting you to come out of your own selves a bit, realizing it's not all about you.
you've got to put yourself in other people's shoes to figure out what they care about and what they're going to try and do, so you can respond well to that.
while we're here, let's just mention that things will get more complicated in a world where I don't actually know the payoffs of my opponent.
it's much easier to figure out my own payoffs than to figure out my opponent's payoffs.
I might not know whether I'm playing someone who's an evil git or an indignant angel.
so I'm going to have to figure out what the odds are of that in doing this exercise.
and we're going to come back to that idea too way at the end of the class, but that's getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but we'll get there.
now, it turns out that this game, this Prisoner's Dilemma, with the Alpha's and Beta's, or essentially the same game, has been played many, many, many times in experiments.
so out there in the real world... I think we can do this here out there in the real world when they do these experiments.
they find out that roughly 70%
of people choose Alpha and roughly 30% choose Beta.
roughly, almost a third choose Beta.
what do we think is going on?
that's a third of the people who seem to be choosing a dominated strategy or is it?
what's going on there?
why do you think 30%
of people are choosing Beta?
anybody?
can we catch this guy here?
they might be motivated by the fact that every person who chooses Beta raises the average score.
they could be moral people.
so one possibility is: this 30% of people in the real world who choose Beta are just nice people.
what else could it be?
yeah?
I know this might be changing the game a little bit, but if you ever expected to play the same game with the partner you have more...
all right, they could be thinking they're going to play again.
long run payoffs are greater if you choose Beta every time.
so it could be that they think that this is actually they haven't understood the experiment and they think this is a multi shot game, not a one shot game, good.
what else could it be?
what's the simplest explanation?
what's the other obvious explanation?
they could just be stupid, right?
it could be.
are we allowed to say that in class?
let's be honest here, when we say experiments in the real world in Game Theory...
or the ones you read about in The New York Times the real world when it comes to experiments in Economics really means undergraduates at the University of Arizona.
I mean, I'm not making it up. It just does.
they all are.
I don't know anything about... are any of you from Arizona, I don't know...
I don't know whether the average undergrad at the University of Arizona just has a sunny personality or whether they "spent too long in the sun."
I just don't know which it is, right?
we can't really distinguish from this.
how about at Yale.
what's our numbers here.
how about in this class?
do you want to mike your colleague here?
so 238 at Yale... this is Yale... versus 36.
so even at my level of arithmetic that's a lot less than 30%.
that's more like less than 15%.
it's about 15% I guess.
so 236... I'm sorry 238... chose Alpha, and 36 chose Beta.
now there's one more lesson in this class and this is going to be it.
this isn't the end of the class but one more lesson to take home.
you guys are going to be playing games among each other today and until...
december 7, whatever is the end of term.
look around each other.
you better get to know each other a bit.
and what did we learn today about you guys?
the lesson here, lesson 5, is Yale students are evil.
be aware of that when you're playing games.
I want to play one more game today in the remaining minutes.
it doesn't matter if we finish a little bit early, but I want to try to get this game at least started.
so do you all have game 2 in front of you?
just while you're reading that over, can I also make sure you've all got your legal forms and you're going to sign.
don't walk away with your legal forms, we need to get those collected in.
so at the end of talking about this game,
I'm going to collect in both the second game for the class and also the legal form.
if you don't have a legal form, if you've lost it or something, it's online.
let's have a look at that second game.
I'll read it out for you.
game 2: pick a number.
everyone got this?
anyone not got this?
everyone got it?
good.
without showing your neighbor what you're doing, put in the box below a whole number between 1 and 100
whole number between 1 and 100 integer.
we will calculate the average number chosen in the class.
the winner in this game is the person whose number is closest to two-thirds times the average in the class.
again: the winner is the person whose number is closest to two-thirds times the average number in the class.
the winner will win $5 minus the difference in pennies between her choice and that two-thirds of the average.
just to make sure you've understood this, let me do an example on the board.
I've got one more board; that's good.
so imagine there were three people in the class, and imagine that they chose 25, 5, and 60.
so 25 plus 5 plus 60 is 90.
people should feel free to correct my arithmetic because it's often wrong; 90 right?
two-thirds of 90
what do I need, start again.
I need to divide it by three to get the average.
so the average is 30.
so the total is 90, the average is 30, am I right so far?
so two-thirds of the average so two-thirds of the average is 20.
I'm looking desperately at the T. A.
is that right?
okay, so the average is 30 and two-thirds of the average is 20.
so who's the winner here, which number would have won here?
25 would have won.
25 would have been the closest, and what would they have won?
they would have won five bucks minus five cents for a total of four ninety-five
now to make this interesting, let's play this for real.
so this of course relies on me having brought some money and we'll have to do this without dislodging the microphone.
so I'm going to see if I have about that.
I'm going to see if I have enough money to do this in class for real.
when we played this game in the old days, during the dot com boom with the MBA students, you had to put fifty dollars on the table to get them interested.
graduate students: five cents will do it.
okay, so this is a...
there's some bloke with a beard on this one.
yeah this is Lincoln apparently.
who knew, Lincoln?
okay, so this is a five-dollar note and I'm going to put it...
sorry about that again... I'm going to put it in an envelope.
I'm not cheating anybody
no magic tricks here.
and this is going to be the prize for this game and we better give this to someone we trust.
it's the prize for 159.
who do you guys trust?
the camera guy.
okay Jude, we know Jude's going to be there next week.
I'm giving it to Jude.
you can't see this on camera. People at home...
but I'm giving it to Jude okay.
I'm going to put it here, and Jude has to show up next week with the prize.
I thought we should give it to the guy at the back, who is the moral guy.
who is our moral guy at the back?
well never mind, we will give it to Jude.
we know Jude's going to be here.
all right, has everyone put a number down?
any questions?
just shout them out to me.
so given that we only have one five dollar does there have to be one unique winner, and if so, how is that determined if we have multiple people who are...
that's a good question.
if there's multiple winners, we'll divide it but we'll make sure everyone has a positive winning.
good question.
given the number of people in the room there may be multiple winners,
I accept that possibility.
has everyone written down a number now?
all right, so hand your numbers to the end of the row, but don't go yet.
hand it on to the end of the row.
before you go I want five things from you.
I want to know the five lessons from this class.
tell me what you learnt?
what were the five lessons?
without looking at your notes, what were the five lessons?
anybody, shout out one of the lessons, yes madam.
don't play a strictly dominated strategy.
don't play a strictly dominated strategy, anything else?
yes sir.
Yale students are evil.
Yale students are evil.
two lessons down, three to go.
he guy over here.
rational choices can lead to bad outcomes.
rational choices can lead to bad outcomes.
we put it more graphically before but that's fine.
two more outcomes.
put yourself in other people's shoes.
put yourself in other people's shoes and I'm missing one,
I can't recall which one I'm missing now.
you can't get what you want so you you can't get what you want.
you could but it's a good idea to figure out what you want before you try and get what you want.
five things you learnt today, hand in your numbers and the legal forms and I'll see you on monday.
last time we talked a lot about the idea
I didn't mention the name but here's some jargon for you we talked about the idea of deleting dominated strategies:
looking at a game;
figuring out which strategies are dominated;
deleting them;
looking at the game again;
looking at which strategies are now dominated;
deleting those; and so on and so forth.
this process is called the "iterative deletion of dominated strategies.
this is not a great title for Barry's book.
you need to do better than that to get the two hundred and fifty dollars.
this is a boring title, but never mind.
iterative Deletion of Dominated Strategies.
the idea is...It embodies the idea of putting yourself in someone else's shoes and trying to figure out what they're going to do, and then think about them putting themselves in your shoes, figuring out what you're going to do, and so on and so forth.
last time, we saw already, that this is a very powerful idea, in that game last time.
but we also saw it's a dangerous idea to take too literally:
that sometimes this can get you to over-think the problem and actually, as in that numbers game last time, the best choice, the winning choice, might not involve so many rounds.
we also saw in that numbers game last time that in some games, but by no means all games, in some games this process actually converges to a single choice.
in that numbers game it converged to 1.
so once again what this idea isthis idea is you yourself should not play a dominated strategy.
delete those.
delete those for everyone else, because everyone else is not going to play a dominated strategy.
delete those.
look at the game with all those dominated strategies deleted.
see if there are any strategies that are now dominated.
delete those.
look again, etc. , etc.
I could write that all up.
we saw it in practice last time.
it's probably just easier to have the idea there.
one tip about this, try to identify all the dominated strategies of all players before you delete, then delete.
then look again.
try to identify all the dominated strategies of all players again, and then delete.
that process will prevent you from getting into trouble.
so today, I want to be a little bit less abstract, if you like, and I want to look at an application.
I want to look at a famous application from politics.
so we're going to look at a model of politics.
the idea is going to be this.
we're going to imagine that there are two candidates, and what these candidates are doing is they're choosing their political positions for an election.
so these are the players, and the strategies are going to be
they're going to choose positions on a spectrum, on a political spectrum.
to make life easy, we're going to assume that this political spectrum has ten positions.
so here are the positions.
we'll call them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
very difficult.
what's the idea here?
we haven't finished describing the game.
what's the idea?
the idea is that these positions are left wing positions and these positions are right wing positions.
so you could think of these extreme left wing positions.
these are people who, I guess, they don't eat anything except for fruit and they think that trees should have the vote.
these guys out here, these are the extreme right wing positions.
so they think the poor shouldn't have the vote and they eat immigrants.
I'm an immigrant: better be careful.
the candidates here are going to try and choose positions.
we're going to assume...this is not realistic we're going to assume for now that there are 10% of the voters at each of these positions.
so there's 10% of the voters at each position.
so they are uniformly distributed.
we're going to assume that voters will eventually vote for the closest candidate.
so voters vote for the closest candidate:
the candidate whose position is closest to their own.
and we'll need a tiebreaking assumption and we'll do the obvious tiebreak.
if there's a tie then the voters split.
the voters of that position split evenly.
if there's a tie, half the voters at that position go for one of the candidates and half of them go for the other.
so here's a game, I've got the players, that's the candidates.
I've got the strategies, that's the political positions.
what am I missing?
I'm missing payoffs, right?
I'm missing payoffs.
it matters in this game a lot how we specify the payoffs but we're going to assume that the payoffs are that the candidates aim to maximize their share of the vote.
but that's not the only thing we could have assumed.
we could have assumed that all they really care about is winning and that winning gave them a high payoff and that losing gave them nothing.
I'm going to assume a little bit more and I'm going to assume that
I haven't spelled maximized right, max will do they want to max their share of the vote.
the reason this isn't a terrible assumption is you could think that getting a higher share of the vote gives you a mandate.
or, if this is a primary election, a larger share of the vote gives you a bigger push for the next primary or whatever.
so we'll assume that they're trying to maximize their share of the vote.
so we want to know what's going to happen in this game.
it seems like a pretty natural, pretty important game.
okay, so given what we've learned so far in the class, a natural first question to ask is: are any of the strategies here?
there are ten strategies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, are any of the strategies dominated?
are any strategies dominated?
let's get someLet me get my microphones up and ready a little bit.
so any strategies dominated?
how about this gentleman in blue?
so stand up and shout, yeah.
okay, 1 and 10 are both dominated.
so this gentleman whose name is?
Steven.
steven says 1 and 10.
we'll come back to 10.
you're right.
we'll come back to 10.
so he says that position 1, strategy 1, choosing the most extreme left wing position is a dominated strategy.
what dominates it by the way?
Steven, you want to shout it out?
2
so for example. So our conjecture here is that 2 dominates 1.
that's the claim.
let's just be careful here, what does it mean to say that 2 dominates 1?
it means that choosing position 2
always gives me a higher share of the vote than choosing position 1, no matter where the other candidate positions herself.
it does not mean 2 beats 1.
so let's take Steven's conjecture and see if it's true.
so, in particular, let's start working out what share of the votes you'd get if you chose position 1 or position 2, against different positions the other guy can choose.
so, for example, what we're going to do is we're going to test does 2 dominate 1?
while we're doing this we'll figure out how these payoffs work as well.
well, how about versus 1.
so suppose the other candidate has chosen position 1.
so the other candidate has chosen position 1.
then we're going to compare my payoff from choosing 1
against the other candidate's payoff from choosing 1.
we're going to compare this with my payoff from choosing 2
against the other candidate choosing 1.
let's figure out what that is.
so what's mysomebody can shout this outwhat's my share of the vote if I choose 1 and the other candidate chooses 1?
50%.
that was pretty easy, right?
it must be a tie for everybody, so I'll get 50% of the vote.
what's my share of the vote if I choose 2 and the other candidate chooses 1?
90%.
he will get or she will get all the voters at 1.
I'll get everyone else.
so I get 90%.
so in this case choosing 2 is better than choosing 1.
but of course we're not done yet.
we have to consider other possible positions of my opponent.
so suppose my opponent chooses 2.
so now we're comparing my choosing 1, when my opponent chooses 2, and the payoff I would get if I choose 2 when my opponent chooses 2.
so what's my payoff if I choose 1 and my opponent chooses 2?
I get all the voters right on top of me at position 1
and she gets everyone else, is that right?
so I get 10%.
and what about if we both choose 2?
50%, everybody happy with that?
so 50% in this case, and once again, 2 did better than 1.
everyone happy with that?
so we showed this choice was better and this choice was better, and we're going to keep on going.
against 3: so now we're comparing my choosing 1 versus 3
and my choosing 2 versus 3.
if I choose 1 against 3, what share of the vote do I get?
I'm going to get all the people at position 1
and half the people at position 2 for a total of 15.
and if I chose 2 against 3, what do I get?
I get 20, I get all the people at 1 and I get all the people 2, so I get 20%, so we're okay again.
let's do one more just to see a pattern here.
so if I choose 1 against 4, and comparing my choosing 2 against 4.
in the former case if I choose 1 against 4, how many votes do I get?
I get all the people at 1, and all the people at 2, so I get 20% of the votes, she gets everyone else.
and here if I choose 2 against 4,
I get all the people at 1, all the people at 2, and what?
half the people at 3, so that comes out as 25%
and once again and so on.
now, I could go on right the way through here, but I'm going to stop because it gets to be a bit boring after a while.
I'm guessing you can see a pattern emerging here.
what's the pattern here?
what's the pattern here?
somebody?
Where's that?
somebody raise their hand so we can get a micke out there.
can we get a mike on this guy in white?
stand up, stand up, yep, stand up and shout.
2 is always better than 1.
2 is always better than 1, but we can see more than that in the pattern.
that's right, but what's the pattern here?
Mike back here.
whatever's closer to 5 is better than whatever's farther away from 5.
that's not quite the pattern I'm looking for.
let's look at the numbers here.
we had 15, 20, then this one, up to 20, 25 and so on.
so what's the pattern here?
Yes, Steven again.
if your opponent doesn't choose 1 or 2, then you're always going to be 5% better off if you choose 2 than 1.
exactly, so ignoring these first two positions which were a bit weird, choosing 2 always gave me 5% more votes than choosing 1, regardless of what the other person chooses.
so I mean if you want, you can fill in the next whatever it isthe next 6 positions and see.
but you'll see that very clearly that Steven's right:
that choosing 2 will always get me 5% more of the votes than choosing 1 from here on down.
and in fact, they'll go up in intervals of 5.
so, in fact, it is true, it is in fact true, so we can conclude that 2 dominates ...in fact, we can do a bit better than that ...we can say strictly dominates 1.
2 strictly dominates 1.
is anything else dominated here, Steven already told us that 10 is dominated.
I'm not going to go through that argument.
can everyone see that is symmetric?
hang on a second, everyone see that 10 is going to be dominated by 9 in exactly the same way?
is that obvious?
it's just really the same argument coming in the other direction.
so similarly, 9 strictly dominates 10.
and again, we're not saying choosing 2 beats choosing 1, 2 wins against 1 or 9 wins against 10.
we're saying choosing 2 always does better than choosing 1, regardless of what the other person chooses.
choosing 9 always is better than choosing 10
regardless of what the other person chooses.
there was a question, are we okay?
you want to get the mike in for the question?
stand and shout out to everyone.
I think you may have defined it already, but I couldn't find a definition of strictly in the book we have.
okay, well you have one on the handout.
I think there probably is one in there somewhere, but just in case, we have had two in class, there's one on the handout.
all right we've concluded that 1 is dominated by 2, and 10 is dominated by 9.
is anything else dominated here?
well what about thinking about whether 2
is dominated by 3, after a... I've forgotten your name... what's your name there?
yes?
Sudiptha.
Sudiptha had suggested earlier on, you want to be close to 5.
so 3 is closer to 5 than 2.
is 2 dominated by 3?
anyone else?
anyone else?
any other hands?
there's a hand here.
can you get this lady here?
once you delete the dominated strategies, then you kind of go through it again and then 2 is dominated by 3.
good, so you're getting ahead of us, good.
so we' ll get there, hold that thought.
but what about right now before we delete anything?
so let's check it out.
let's check it out.
so, in particular, let's just try this process.
so how about my payoff versus 1, for example.
so 2 against 1 gives me 90% of the votes, 3 against 1 gives me what?
85% of the votes which is actually lower, so it's clear that 3 doesn't dominate 2.
in particular, if the other candidate were to choose position 1,
I would get a higher share of the vote choosing 2 than I would have done if I had chosen 3.
so, in fact, it's not the case that 2 is dominated by 3.
but the woman who's name I either didn't get or forgot.
Christine.
so Christine has pointed something out.
so Christine, why don't you wait for the mike and point that out again.
so we know that 2 is not dominated, and particularly not dominated by 3, but, what's the "but"?
when you delete the dominated strategy of 2 dominating 1, or 1 being dominated, when you delete that and 10, then it is.
so what Christine is arguing is, even though it's the case that 2 is not a dominated strategy, if we do the process of iterative deletion of dominated strategies and we delete the dominated strategies, then maybe we should look again and see if it's dominated now.
so let's be careful here, we're not saying that we're going to delete the voters at 1, or delete the voters at 10, though we might wish to.
we're just saying we want... what we're saying is, we know that the candidates aren't going to position themselves at 1
and aren't going to position themselves at 10.
so in some sense we're deleting those strategies.
the voters are still there.
so let's try that.
so if we... there's a but here I guess...
if we delete the strategies 1 and 10, which were dominated, then does 3 dominate 2?
once again, we can try it out.
so let's try it out.
so the payoff from choosing 1, let's start against 2.
so the payoff from choosing 2 against 2 is 50%.
the payoff from choosing 3 against 2 is what?
what's the payoff from choosing 3?
someone can shout out.
what's the payoff from choosing 3 against 2?
80%, the person at 2 is going to get all the ones at 1, and all the ones at 2, and 3 will get everything else.
so this is 80%.
versus 3, the payoff of 2 against 3 is all the people at 1, all the people at 2, so it's 20%.
the payoff from choosing 3 against 3, is of course 50%, so, so far so good.
so far choosing 3 is better.
against 4, the payoff from choosing 2 against 4 is what?
what's the payoff from choosing 2 against 4?
again, all the people at 1, all the people at 2, and half the people at 3, so that's 25%.
the payoff from choosing 3 against 4 is going to be all the people at 1, all the people at 2, and all the people at 3, for a total of 30%, which again is bigger.
let's do one more.
versus 5, the payoff from choosing 2...
I can afford to raise this a bit...
against 5, is all the people at 1, all the people at 2, and all the people at 3, 30%.
whereas the payoff from choosing 3 against 5 is all the people at 1, all the people at 2, all the people at 3 and half the people at 4, 35%.
and again, you can see exactly the same pattern is going to emerge here.
from here on down, if I bothered to do it, we'd find that choosing 3 always gets me 5% more of the vote than
I would have had from choosing 2, against any of these higher numbers.
the same pattern Steven pointed out before.
so, I've forgotten your name again, I'm sorry.
Christine.
so Christine is correct in saying that once we delete the strategies 1 and 10
once we realize that those positions are not going to be chosen by our sophisticated candidates then we realize that probably choosing 2 and of course 9
isn't a good idea either.
so 2 and 9 are not dominated but they are dominated once we realize 1 and 10
won't be played, or won't be chosen.
okay, so where are we going here?
where are we going?
where is this discussion going to end up?
let's come back to our original game.
we've argued that 1 and 10 shouldn't be chosen because they're dominated.
we've argued that once we realize those aren't going to be played, that 2 and 9 aren't going to be played.
what's going to end up being played?
well let's just go slower.
so we were able to dominate 1 and 10 in the first round, so we know this won't be played, and we know this won't be played.
and remember the voters are still there, we're just deleting the strategies.
then we dominated, then we ruled out...
I'll put double crosses for "in the second round..." 2 and 9.
then we ruled out 3 and 8, and then we ruled out, we would have done 4 and 7 and that leaves just 5 and 6.
so if we do the procedure of iteratively deleting dominated strategies, going back again, looking what's dominated, doing it again, doing it again, all that's left is 5 and 6.
so this procedure leads us to conclude that the candidates will choose positions 5 and 6.
does 5 dominate 6, or 6 dominate 5, or anything like that?
no, at that point it's just a tie, right?
so in the end, the procedure, so iterative deletion...
let's write "it del..."
leads to deleting all except 5 and 6.
so this was just a simple exercise, I think.
I mean I'm hoping that was a simple exercise.
let me just look out there, is everyone following that okay?
that really wasn't meant to be hard, but what's relevant about this exercise is not the fact that it's hard.
in fact, it isn't hard.
what's relevant is the fact that it's relevant.
it's about the real world.
in particular, this is a famous model in political science.
anyone know the name of this model?
what's the prediction here?
the prediction here is that the candidates are going to be squeezed towards the middle.
they're going to choose positions very close to each other and very close to the center.
what's that called?
anyone know?
hold the thought on that.
someone at the back, shout out.
this is the "Median Voter Theorem," thank you.
so let's have a new board, this one will do fine.
so the prediction is candidates crowd the center and this is called, in Political Science, the Median Voter Theorem.
it's called the Median Voter Theorem because the voters at the center, in this case 5 and 6, actually get to decide not just the election, but to decide therefore, what policies are put in place.
how does this do as a prediction of the real world?
well there are examples in American History in which the Median Voter Theorem looks pretty good.
they're pretty old examples.
they're going to be before you guys were born, but let me mention them anyway.
so I think a lot of people...
if you go back today and you look at tapes of the Kennedy Nixon Election in 1960
some American help me out here, 60 right?
I think it was 60.
so in the 1960's actually, between Kennedy and Nixon, if you ever go over and look at those tapes, it's amazing how conservative Kennedy looks when you think about his reputation today.
they really were crowding the center.
and eight years later Nixon seemed to have learned his lesson.
if you look at the 1968 election, which Nixon won, Nixon sounds, on those tapes of his policies being put forth in that election, he looks extremely liberal for a Republican.
so again, they were crowding that center space.
some people argue that that's exactly what Clinton did in '92.
he took the Democratic Party to the right, towards the center in order to pick up those central voters and win.
so there are examples in American History of elections that seem to...
in which the Median Voter Theorem seems to do well.
we'll come back and discuss it more in a second, but before I do, let me mention that the same model, exactly the same idea, has an application in Economics.
somebody mentioned it already over there.
the application in Economics is to do with product placement, something that Jake's working on.
in product placement, you might think when you're placing a gas station, you might think it would be nice if gas stations spread themselves evenly out over the town or out over the road
so wherever you happen to be, when you run out gas, there was a gas station close by.
that would be convenient.
but unfortunately, gas stations, as we all know, they tend to crowd into the same corners, they tend to be on the same road junctions, right?
Why?
because they're trying to, they're competing for voters who happen to be close, or running out of gas at those moments, and by crowding together they avoid being out competed by each other in terms of position.
I said that a bit quickly, but we'll come back and look at that idea in more detail later on in the class.
so in politics, this is about candidates crowding close together towards the center, to try and get as many voters who are close to them.
and in Economics, this is about firm's crowding together to try and get shoppers who are close to them.
the people associated with this are a guy called Anthony Downs, who did this in Political Science, in a book in 1957.
and in Economics, a guy called Hotelling, who wrote a paper about this in 1929.
in Political Science, they call this "simultaneous discovery.
I think 1929 is a bit earlier, but never mind.
now, what I want to do now, what I want to is, periodically in the class and we have a model up there and we've got to analyze it.
we've used a bit of Game Theory to analyze it.
I want us to talk about whether we think it's right.
what do we think of the strengths and weaknesses of this model?
so what I want you to start thinking about is, do you believe this model?
is this a good model of politics?
what's it missing?
let me come off the stage a second, so I can encourage you to get involved in the discussion.
how many of you are Poly Sci majors?
raise your hands you Poly Sci majors.
by the way, how many of you are Poly Sci majors who have seen this model before?
some of you have seen it before.
so what's this model missing?
you all live in America.
you all live in a democracy.
you don't all live in America, but a lot of you live in a democracy.
do you have some idea about this?
so what are we missing here?
so can we get the woman here Ale?
the voters are not evenly distributed 10%, 10%, 10%.
so one thing that seems odd about the way we set up this model is that the voters are not evenly distributed.
let me go and put that up... it'll be tiring but let me go to and fro a bit.
so one thing that's missing, or wrong if you like, but the one thing is the voters are not evenly distributed in the real world.
good, anything else?
good we'll talk about each of these in turn.
can I get the guy over here?
sorry I'm not making this easy for Jude, let me just stay down here.
I'll collect a few and then go back to the board.
the model doesn't take into account differences between the groups in voter turnout, based on the candidates.
good, so there's an issue of turnout.
we assumed here that everyone votes, is that right?
but in fact, not everyone votes, there's always the option of not voting.
remind me to put that one up, "not voting," you'll have to remind me of these.
how about the gentleman here in the yellow.
there's a difference between the primary and general election.
good, so we assumed, we kind of jumped to just one election and at least in the American system, for better or for worse... I could voice an opinion on that...
there are lots of little elections on the way.
there are primaries in all these states that you never, you probably have heard of, states you probably have heard of along the way.
anything else?
can we get the... where's the other mike?
can we get the woman in green here?
american voters often vote based on character rather than position.
so there's more than just positions.
another way of saying that, stop me if this is wrong, but one way to say that is we've been assuming that politics is one dimensional, left/right and there might be other things involved:
character or even among issues, even among political issues it could be more than one dimension.
it could be that there's a dimension about the environment and a dimension about foreign policy, and maybe another dimension about redistributive politics.
so that's an important idea.
let me get a couple more, can we get?
the model might not apply with more than two candidates.
so another issue here is, I just assumed that there were two candidates.
we know in some elections there was a third candidate.
for example, there was Nader in the election in well I guess he was there in the other one as well but he was particularly there in 2000.
so, by the way, I don't mean this as a joke, in some sense there's always a third candidate and that comes from the problem we had earlier, because not voting is always an option.
so in principle, in that election in 2000, there was at least four candidates, as it were, four things you could do with your vote.
you could vote for, as it was in that time, Gore, Bush, Nader, or not voting and I'll leave it to you to decide which of those is equivalent to not voting.
anyone else?
one other thing I think that's really, maybe it's a small thing, there's one other glaring thing here.
someone we haven't had yet, Ale help me out here.
let me get this guy here.
extrapolating from the fact that there are different things which people take into account, not everyone closest to 6 might actually vote for 6, it might be coincidence.
that's true, although that may be a question of dimension.
I had a different thing in mind.
let me say it.
so I think this is important.
a candidate could say during an election that "I'm a moderate candidate, I'm at position 5
but you might not believe him or her.
you've got the candidates' track record, unless that candidate can commit to policies at position 5, you might know full well that the candidate is in fact a position 10
or a position 1 candidate, is that right?
so unless the candidate can actually commit to a position, there may be a problem in them simply announcing, "my position is moderate.
so again, let's think of an example here, a couple of examples, in the Bush Gore election, we saw President Bush, candidate Bush as was, saying "I'm not a right wing candidate, I'm a compassionate conservative.
and you guys believed him.
I don't know, maybe he was, I don't know.
his track record in Texas probably did actually look a lot like that.
or today, if you look at both primaries going on now, you're seeing various candidates on both the Republican side and the Democratic side, seek to position themselves.
but as you all know, those candidates almost all have track records, and not everybody believes that Clinton, that Hilary Clinton, is quite so centrist as she now seems.
and not everyone believes that the former Governor of Massachusetts is quite so conservative as he now seems.
so it's not clear that you can just choose your position willy nilly.
so let's put some of these up.
so I'm going to forget remember, so you're going to have to help me out a bit.
so we have many candidates, more than just two;
or we have not voting, which is related to that actually;
and we have choosing your position, the inability to commit to a position.
so your position may be not believed, and I want to claim that that's connected to the idea that you can't commit yourself to your policies.
we had some others.
we had primaries;
and we had other dimensions, so we had higher dimensions.
have I got the main ones now?
I think I got most of the main ones.
so there's lots of things... when we look at this model...
there's lots of things that are missing.
a lot of things are not seeming to be captured by it.
and here's where I want to get a little bit more religious, if you like.
it's tempting to say, look, we wrote up this model.
it's missing all this stuff, so it must be useless.
you know we shouldn't model it.
you might even go further, you might say modeling it is always going to miss stuff out, so let's just not bother.
that, I think, is the wrong conclusion here.
the right conclusion, I think, is:
the reason we write down these models is to try and capture and test our intuitions.
in this case, the intuition about crowding towards the center to get votes.
but, of course, these models abstract from very important parts of reality, and the next step to do is what?
is to say, okay， now let's try to enrich the model, to add more into the model, and see if you get a different result, and if so why?
so you start with your basic model, then you add in, you enrich the model, and you see if the results change, and that'll help you explain why you're getting different results in different settings.
so the sort of religious part of today's class is models are always abstractions.
you want to use them to see what's missing, and then add things back in, to see if they make a difference, and if so how.
let's go through these a little bit.
so it turns out that the very first one, voters are not evenly distributed is certainly true, it's undoubtedly true.
but it turns out that if you make the voters distributed more realistically, let's say like on a bell-curve shape, it makes actually no difference to the result at all.
so this is true, but it doesn't actually change the result.
so on this one we're okay.
the result survives this change.
what about the one about many candidates?
well clearly that matters a lot.
we know that there were many candidates in the '92 election and the 2000 election, and we know that "not voting" is important.
so this one I'm going to let you see whether it makes a difference.
this one's going to be on the problem set.
so I'm actually going to get you to do this.
let's go back to the model, add in an extra candidate, and see what happens.
you can learn whether it makes a difference.
I'm not going to give it away.
the one about committing to policy: this is important.
it's really hard for candidates to convince you, that they really are a left, or a right, or a centrist candidate.
let me give you a historical example outside of America, but in the real world, in England.
in the '97... In the 80's and 90's, the Labor Party in England had lost election, after election, after election.
and in each election, they would come forward and say, "we are not really a left wing party, we're a centrist party these days
and people would say, we don't believe you.
so what Tony Blair, the guy who won the '97 election, did with "New Labor" policy was:
he managed to commit to a centrist policy by literally committing to it.
he took the... In England you have to publish your economic and financial plans of the Government five years in ahead.
so he took the financial plans of the conservative Government that was then in power, five years ahead, and he said these are my financial plans
I'm going to announce these today as my financial plans five years ahead.
they're exactly the same policies as the Conservative Government has.
so not only was he choosing a position close to the Conservatives:
he was choosing exactly their position.
and it came down to what somebody else said here:
that left the election on the other dimension, which might have been character or whatever.
that won; that won by a big way.
so nevertheless, even having given you that historical example, we're going to come back and we'll look later on in the class at a model in which politicians cannot choose their positions, but, rather, you know their positions ahead of time.
so we'll do this one.
we'll do this one later.
these other two, primaries and higher dimensions, they're both great points.
we're not going to have time to do them in this course, but if you take a class in the Political Science department on voting and on elections, on modeling elections, you will see that both of these have been modeled and discussed in great detail.
there's even some empirical work on just how high dimensions are really involved in elections.
so this is great stuff for this area of Political Science.
I want to inspire you to take some more advanced courses albeit in another department.
so have I convinced you that there's something you can do with iterative deletion?
we used iterative deletion in a relatively abstract setting, or not abstract, rather a play setting last time in which were choosing numbers.
and then we talked about it in terms of Hannibal invading Rome.
and now we've seen how it applies here in an election game.
I think that's probably enough for iterative deletion.
so what I want to do now is I want to switch course and introduce a new tool.
this is what we'll do typically in the class, we'll have new tools.
we'll see how they apply.
we'll see what we can learn with them.
and we'll move onto a new tool.
so I'm going to switch to a new tool.
any questions at this point?
everyone happy at this point?
happy is too strong... are people satisfied at this point?
okay, so we're going to move away from this example and I'm going to introduce a new subject, and I'll need several boards I think, so I might as well collect them.
that little semi-religious speech about modeling, I think economists, those of you who are Economics majors you're thinking, yeah, what's the problem?
for those of you who are History majors or Political Science majors, that's more of an issue.
so you really want to think about why we're modeling, what do we get from this exercise?
I want to move to a different approach now and a different approach to analyzing games is going to be about, what we're going to call, best response.
to kick this off, let's look at an example.
so here's a game, a very simple game with two players.
player I is choosing Up, Middle, or Down.
and Player II is choosing Left or Right, and the payoffs are as follows.
they're nothing very interesting.
they're just numbers thought up for the purpose: and .
so we've got , , , , , and .
so, first of all, let's try and analyze this game using the tools we've learned so far.
so does either player have a dominated strategy?
any takers?
so I claim that neither player has a dominated strategy, let's just check.
so, for example, you might think Down is dominated, but if we look a bit carefully we see that Down actually does better than Up against Right, and Down does better than Middle against Left.
similarly, we can see that Right is not dominated, because it does better against Up, than does Left.
but Left isn't dominated because it does better against Middle than does Right;
so on and so forth.
you can work through this game and you can check pretty quickly that nothing is dominated.
so if the only tool I taught you in this class was dominated strategies and the iterative deletion of dominated strategies we'd be stuck.
you wouldn't be able to get started on this game.
nevertheless, it's a pretty simple game, pretty straightforward game.
imagine you're Player I in this game, what do you think you'd do?
what would you do if you were Player I?
let's have a show of hands actually.
so let's just see, look at it a bit.
no abstentions.
how many of you would choose Up?
raise your hand for Up.
raise your hands right now.
keep your hand down, you're an SOM student.
you can keep your hand up.
Oh, your math was wrong, okay.
you did accounting last year.
no one's choosing Up?
no one's choosing Up at all, okay.
how about Middle?
one person chose Middle.
how about Down?
Oh my goodness.
okay there's a massive majority for Down.
so let's think about this a second.
what if you knew that Player II was going to choose Left?
what would you choose if you just happened to know that Player II was going to choose Left?
everyone agree because 5 is bigger than 1, and 5 is bigger than 4, so Up isand to use a technical term we'll define formally next time
up is the best response to Left.
everyone agree with that?
so Up, as I say, does best against Left.
now what does best against Right?
middle does best against Right, after all, 4 is bigger than 0 and 4 is bigger than 2, so Middle does best against Right.
so here's an interesting thing.
all of you chose Down, but Up does best against Left and Middle does best against Right.
let's just push this a bit harder, suppose that you work for somebody.
some of you are going to go out of Yale and be your own boss, but most of you are going to, like me, are going to end up working for somebody.
and suppose now this game came along in your line of work and you'd chosen up.
then your boss came to you, and looks rather fiercely at you so this is Rick Levin or somebody looking rather fiercely at me, and says "why did you choose Up?
what can I do? I can say:
Oh I chose Up because I thought the other guy was going to choose Left.
I have a way of rationalizing choosing Up.
I believe the other guy is going to choose Left, I can rationalize choosing Up.
is that right?
because that might save me from getting fired, at least for now.
similarly, if I had chosen Middle and President Levin comes along to me and says "why did you choose Middle?
I can say: "okay I chose Middle because I believed that the other guy was going to choose Right and Middle was the best thing for me to do against Right.
once again, if I'm lucky I won't get fired.
it seems like I've managed to rationalize choosing middle.
but Down, all of you chose Down.
pretty much all of you chose Down.
down is going to be a little trickier.
how am I going to rationalize choosing down?
can I rationalize choosing Down?
you all chose it.
I'm your boss now.
why did you choose down?
somebody who hasn't said anything yet.
can I get the mikes up and perhaps the person right in front of you.
stand up and shout.
it's the safer answer if you can't decide whether or not your opponent's going to choose Left or Right, so you don't have to worry about having a payoff of 0.
all right, so in some sense it's safer, it avoids the 0, although I mean it's true it avoids the 0
but it also doesn't get the 5 and the 4.
but I think the key part of your answer was I might not know.
I might not be sure whether the opponent, whether my opponent, is choosing Left or Right.
for example, I might believe that it's equally likely that they choose Left and Right, is that right?
so let's look at something.
let's look at my payoffs from choosing these three options Up, Middle, and Down, if I think it's equally likely that my opponent will choose Left and Right.
so what we're going to look at is the expected payoff of Up versus, let me call it a half half, a half half being equally likely that my opponent chooses Left and Right.
so what's my expected payoff from choosing Up where I believe the other person's going to choose Left and Right, equally likely?
it's what?
it's a half times 5 plus a half times 0
for a total of 2. 5.
is that right?
what about my expected payoff from choosing Middle against , so in this case where I think it's equally likely that my opponents going to choose Left or Right?
so in this case, my expected payoff is a 1/2 of 1 plus a 1/2 of 4, for a total of again 2. 5.
everyone happy with that?
is my math correct so far?
how about my expected payoff from choosing down versus ?
this is going to equal a 1/2 of 4 plus a 1/2 of 2, which is a 1/2 of 6, so that's 3.
so it turns out that, as the gentleman out there said, if I thought it was equally likely that my opponent was going to choose Left or Right, then actually my best choice, my best response is to choose Down.
not only is it a good compromise. Not only is it safe.
it's actually the best I can do.
it maximizes my expected payoff.
now we're not quite there yet.
we know that Up does best against Left.
we know that Middle does best against Right.
and we know that Down does best if I think it was equally likely that the person was going to choose Left and Right.
but that's not the only beliefs I could have.
for example, I could believe that it's twice as likely that the person's going to choose Left as Right.
it could be, they're twice as likely to choose Left as Right.
so equally likely was probabilities of 1/2 and 1/2.
what probabilities are associated with thinking it's twice as likely they're going to choose Left than Right?
what probabilities are associated with that: .
if I thought there was 2/3 probability they'd choose Left and 1/3 probability they'd choose Right, then I think it's twice as likely they're going to choose Left, and I could redo this calculation.
and in principle, I could redo this calculation for every single possible probability you could think of.
but that would get very boring, so rather than do that, let's draw a picture.
what I want to do is I want to draw a picture here, in which on the horizontal axis,
I'm going to put the probability of the other guy choosing Right.
it's my belief that the other guy's going to choose Right.
think of this as a belief.
on the vertical axis... I'll put two vertical axes in, just for the sake of things on the vertical axis I'll put my expected payoffs.
and let's start by considering my payoffs on this picture, just to help myself a bit, let me put some points in here.
you should probably do the same in your notes.
you probably have lined paper, that makes this easier.
let's start by plotting my expected payoff from choosing the strategy Up.
so this isn't so hard, we know that if I choose Up and there's probability 0 that the other guy is going to choose Right, that's the same as saying I choose Up and the other guy chooses, let's try it again.
if this probability is 0 that the other guy chooses Right, that's the same as saying that the other guy is going to choose Left.
so the probability is 0 of the other guy choosing Left is, the same as, let's try it again.
probability is 0 of their choosing Right is the same as saying they choose Left, so that my payoff from Up against that is given by the top box up there, I get 5.
so this is my payoff from choosing Up against Left.
conversely, if there was probability 1 that the other guy is going to choose Right, and I choose Up, then I get 0.
so this point here corresponds to my payoff if I choose Up and they choose Right.
and we already know if I look at the probability of a 1/2;, which is here, that the payoff I get from choosing, the expected payoff I get from choosing up against a is 2. 5.
so here's a third point we can use.
what is this graph going to look like other than these three points?
what's it going to look like other than these three points?
it's going to be a straight line.
so, you can confirm that for yourself at home, but in fact, if I draw a straight line, this will actually be correct.
so what is this?
this is my expected payoff from choosing Up against the probability of the other person choosing Right, and what is it actually equal to, just to confirm the equation, it's: in that case I'll get a payoff of 5 plus , in which case I get a payoff of 0.
so it doesn't really matter, but that's actually the equation of that line.
what about choosing Middle?
well once again, we can plot that point
so if the other person's choosing Right with probability 0, that's the same as saying they're going to choose Left, and if I chose Middle against Left, I get what?
I get 1, I should use this pointer.
so that's here, and if I knew they were choosing Right for sure, that's the probability of 1 that they're choosing Right, and if I choose Middle I get 4, that's here.
and we've already agreed that if I think it's equally likely they're going to choose right and left, that there's a probability 1/2 of them choosing right
I get 2. 5 from choosing Middle.
so putting that all together, I know that it must go through here again, and once again, I get a straight line.
I think I might have missed slightly but it's more or less right.
so what is this?
this is the payoff to Player I of choosing Middle against Left.
this is the payoff to Player I of choosing Middle against Right, and the line in between, this line here, is the expected payoff to Player I of choosing Middle as a function of the probability that other people choose Right.
now again, we could write down the equation.
it's going to be: times 1, plus times 4.
again, don't worry too much about the equation, we're not really going to do any math here,
I'm just putting it in for completeness.
everyone following me so far?
so let's put in now, the third of these lines.
I really should have used a different color already.
let me switch colors.
let's put the line that corresponds to choosing Down.
so that third line, not to belabor the point, is going to go through here, through 4 and through 2, so this is the payoff from choosing Down against Left, and this is the payoff from choosing Down against Right, and I got those from looking at these payoffs here and here.
in between, once again, it's a straight line.
so here's the straight line, and this line is the expected payoff to Player I from choosing Down as it depends on the probability that the other person chooses Right, and then once again, we can write down the equation.
it's times 4, plus PR times 2.
I claim that this picture really tells me everything
I could possibly want to know when my boss comes along.
when President Levin or Barry Nalebuff who is now walking to the back of the room, when my boss comes along and asks me why did you do that?
why did you do that?
I can now say.
so, for example...
let's put in these crossing points here, for example... what I can say is, if I think it's very likely;
let's call this point X... if I think that the probability that the other person's going to choose Right, is less than X, then the highest payoff I can get corresponds to this line.
that's the highest line and that line corresponds to me choosing Up.
if I think the probability that they're going to choose Right is less than X, then my best response is to choose Up.
conversely, if I think it's more likely than this crossing point Y...
I think it's very likely they're going to choose Right.
it's more likely than Y the probability that they're going to choose Right is more than Y, then the highest line of these three is this one, which corresponds to my choosing Middle.
so over here, my best response is to choose Middle.
let's put that in.
so over here my best response is Middle and over here my best response is Up, and in between it's going to turn out that the highest lines, if my belief that the person's going to choose right is more than X and less than Y, then my highest expected payoff comes from that blue line, and in that case my best response is Down.
I can rationalize all three of these decisions and hope that Barry won't fire me.
now we can do more than that if we're being nerdy, but I'm not going to be this nerdy today.
what we can actually do is we could solve out for the X and for the Y.
how would we go about, I mean I don't want to do it because I'll probably get it wrong, but if I wanted to solve out for this X and the Y, since this is a QR class, let's just talk about it a second.
how would I do it?
somebody who's not a math major, tell me how I solve out for the...
maybe the math majors can't do it actually, it's too simple.
somebody who is a math major, tell me how to solve out for the X and the Y.
let's get a mike on this person here.
set the intersection points equal, the equations equal to each other and solve.
good, good to define... to solve out for X:
x is when this blue line equals, sorry, this blue line equals this red line.
so what we're going to do is take the equations for those two lines, so here's one of those equations and here's the other one, set the P in those equations equal to X,
I've got two equations in one unknown,
I'm sorry, I've got one equation and one unknown.
I've set these two things equal to each other:
I've got one equation and one unknown.
so I can solve out for X.
I think I did that at home.
if you do that at home I think, but don't trust me, you'll find out that X is equal to a third.
now, just to repeat, again I know I've got some math phobics in the audience, let me just slow down a second, all I'm doing here is I'm saying look at this equation of the pink line, look at this equation of the blue line,
x is when they cross, i. e. they are equal to each other.
take these two equations, put an equal sign between them, replace this PR throughout with X,
I'm going to have one equation and one unknown and that even the math phobics in the audience did in high school.
is that right?
now we're going to... I'm going a bit slow here but I'm going to use this method next time to introduce you to the most important class, sorry, the most important game we're going to see in the whole course.
in fact, it's the most important game in the world.
what is the most important game in the world?
don't go yet.
what's the most important game in the world?
we're going to use this idea of best response.
we're going to think about it, and we're going to learn from it in the most important game in the world.
what is the most important game in the world?
football, soccer actually.
soccer is the most important game.
so we're going to show how this technique is going to help us shoot penalty shots in soccer.
before you go, that's Barry Nalebuff at the back, he has copies of the book, it's a great book, go buy it from him.
Prof: Good morning everyone.
we are on the cusp of Valentine's Day.
and I know that there are many of you in this class who feel the same way, and I hope that those of you who entered this class, without having those strong feelings for Rome, have come to love the city and its civilization as much as I do.
so this is a kind of Valentine lecture, for Rome.
and I think that the particular topic that it is, is appropriate, in the sense that we are going to be looking at a number of quite eclectic monuments today, very different monuments, one from the next, and they're full of surprises.
and Rome is always full of surprises;
Rome a city, of course, that you see layers upon layer of civilization, that one peels back to get us back to antiquity, but along the way experiences some amazing things.
so I think that this particular lecture, which will talk about the varied nature of Roman architecture, especially architecture commissioned by individual patrons to preserve their memory for posterity, again is particularly appropriate.
I've called today's lecture "Accessing Afterlife: Tombs of Roman Aristocrats, Freedmen, and Slaves.
we spoke on Tuesday about public architecture commissioned by the emperor Augustus, public architecture that we noted was made primarily out of marble, out of Luna or Carrara marble, that was quarried on the northwest coast of Italy itself, and the objective of it being to try to conjure up the relationship between the new Golden Age of Augustus and the Golden Age, fifth century B. C. of Periclean Athens.
just as Julius Caesar had tried to create a kind of Alexandriaon the Tiber, we see Augustus trying to recreate an Athens on the Tiber.
and Augustus was, of course, very much
in his objectives was very much in keeping with other objectives that we've been studying for some time:
this Hellenization of Roman architecture that we have addressed on a number of occasions.
we spoke last time about the Forum of Augustus in Rome, featuring the Temple of Mars Ultor, that temple that Augustus vowed he would build if he could be victorious over the assassins of Julius Caesar that is, Cassius and Brutus.
he was so, at the Battle of Philippi and he built this forum and he built this temple again as its centerpiece.
and you'll recall again that it was made, for the most part, out of Carrara marble.
we see the columns of Carrara here, a wall, the seventeen Carrara marble steps, and so on.
we also talked about the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Altar of Augustan Peace, put up to the diplomatic agreements or treaties that Augustus made with those in Spain and Gaul:
a monument that was put up near his earlier mausoleum, a monument that was also made out of Carrara marble, and in fact solid Carrara marble.
and this monument too had precedents in the Greek period.
it looked back to a number of sources, but one of those, as we noted on Tuesday, was the Altar of the Twelve Gods, or the Altar of Pity, a fifth-century B. C.
monument that was located in the marketplace of ancient Greece.
so again, both of these buildings, looking back to Greek prototypes in their general format, and also, of course, in the material out of which they were made, namely marble.
when we talked about the Ara Pacis, we talked about the fact that it eventually ended up being part of a kind of architectural complex, that while this architectural complex may have not been planned from the start, it grew up over time into something where all of the buildings related to one another in interesting ways, both in terms of their content and also in terms of their architectural design.
the complex included the Mausoleum of Augustus, the tomb of the emperor Augustus, which was the first monument built on this site, and eventually the Ara Pacis, which you'll recall was actually not located originally where it is now.
it was located in an area a bit here to the upper right originally, on the Via Flaminia that Augustus took when he returned to Rome from Spain and Gaul, but that it was moved, or the remains of it were moved over to this location, next to the Tiber, by Mussolini, because as we noted last time, in the meantime a palace had been built on top of the original location of the Ara Pacis, and that area was no longer available for use.
but again, the Mausoleum of Augustus, the first building of this complex.
you see in this aerial view from Google Earth that the mausoleum ended up becoming the centerpiece of the Piazza Augusto Imperatore, that piazza that Mussolini's architects designed to commemorate Augustus and also to commemorate Mussolini, because that inscription I showed you last time is inserted into the building over here.
if we look at this aerial view of the Mausoleum of Augustus, which you'll see from your Monument List was begun in 28 B. C.
and in fact that should ring some bells for you and we should say something about its genesis in 28 B. C.
because you'll recall that important date of 31;
31 the Battle of Actium when Augustus was victorious over
Antony and Cleopatra and became sole emperor, or began his march to becoming sole emperor of the Roman world.
it's interesting to see him building this massive mausoleum only three years after the Battle of Actium;
that's really quite striking.
why did he do that?
well the reason that he seems to have done that is despite the fact that he lived until 76-years-old, which was very old in ancient Roman times, as I mentioned last time--despite the fact that he lived to that ripe old age, he was not in terribly good health, even as a young man, and he was very concerned about his own longevity.
how long was he going to live?
he knew he had accomplished a lot already by this victory over Antony and Cleopatra, and by some of his other military victories but he wasn't actually sure how long he was going to last, and so he begins to build this gigantic tomb eventually to hold his own remains.
and he completes that tomb in five years.
it's built between 28 B. C. and 23 B. C.
and you'll recall the date of the Ara Pacis is considerably later; 13 to 9 B. C.
so the Ara Pacis was only added to this complex later, and at that point the whole thing was orchestrated with the addition of the obelisk, and we talked about how the obelisk cast a shadow on the Ara Pacis on Augustus' birthday, and so on and so forth.
with regard to the tomb itself, we're going to see something quite striking today, and that is that the tomb is architecturally very different from the Ara Pacis Augustae, and indeed from the Forum of Augustus.
and it's a good example of the eccentricity, as we'll characterize today, of Roman tomb architecture in general.
keep in mind that Roman tomb architecture is the most personal of any form of Roman architecture, which makes it particularly interesting to study, because the only practical requirement for a tomb was that it be able to hold the remains of the deceased.
that's all it needed to do, whereas other buildings had to do all kinds of other things:
have running water through them, and so on and so forth.
but that was not the case here.
so that the patron and the architect could come together to create buildings that were unique to that individual and again were eccentric to a certain degree, and that is indeed what we will see, and that is the case also in the Mausoleum of Augustus.
as we look down on the Mausoleum of Augustus, in this aerial view we see the general plan of it.
we see that there was a central burial chamber;
that there was a hollow drum, and around that hollow drum
and all of this is made of concrete construction
around that hollow drum a series of concentric rings, a series of concentric rings, as you can see them here, again made out of concrete.
and then the outer wall--which you can also see in this view--the outer wall was faced with travertine, which is also interesting; not Luna marble, travertine blocks.
and let me show you another somewhat closer view, also from Google Earth, to show you the structure.
so again the central burial chamber; the hollow drum; the concentric rings around that; the travertine wall around that.
but, of course, you're looking essentially at the core.
this is not what the original entire monument looked like.
and what it was, was in fact there was anearthen tumulus, or an earthen mound, that was placed on top of these concentric rings, and then at the very apex of that earthen mound was a gleaming bronze statue of the emperor Augustus himself.
I think I can make this clearer by showing you a plan of the Mausoleum of Augustus.
and we see all the features I've already described:
the central burial chamber, the hollow drum, again all made out of concrete construction, and the concentric rings around that.
and then the cross-section at the top is particularly helpful
I think because you can see the way in which the concrete has been built up by means obviously of annular vaults, the annular vaults that ultimately support the gleaming bronze statue of Augustus, at the apex.
and you can also see in this cross-section the earthen mound, the way in which the earthen mound is piled up on top of that substructure, that concrete substructure, to create the dome-like shape of the mausoleum on its own.
now scholars who believe--and we all believe in fact that again Augustus was a philhellene, that he had a particular penchant for things Greek.
so you look at something like this and you ask yourselves, "Well, what's Greek about this?
why didn't he, when he came to make thedecision about his last resting place, why did he not want to be laid to rest in the manner of the Greeks?
why doesn't this--why wasn't this tomb made in the form, for example, of a Greek temple, or something like that?
why did he choose this particular form?
so scholars have debated for quite some time whether there are any tombs like this in Greece, or in Asia Minor--what kind of tomb was Alexander the Great buried in, for example?
well we don't know exactly for sure, but that's one possibility, that it might have something to do with Alexander's tomb.
others--because Aeneas came from burning Troy
others have suggested perhaps--and that's in Asia Minor
perhaps the way the Trojans were buried might have something to do with this selection.
but I think the model is much closer at hand.
I think the model--myself, I believe that the model comes from Italy, and that it's a very interesting choice on the part of Augustus, because I think what it tells us is that Augustus may have wanted to build public buildings in Rome that conjured up ancient Athens, but when it came to deciding about how he wanted to be buried, he wanted to be buried in the manner of his Italian ancestors.
let me show you what I think is a really important comparison.
we're looking on the left-hand side of the screen once again at the Mausoleum of Augustus, as it looks today.
here you see the central entranceway.
you see what remains of the concentric, concrete rings.
you see some of the travertine facing for the outer ring of the structure.
and you see, of course, that the uppermost part, namely the earthen mound, is no longer there.
but if I compare the Mausoleum of Augustus, to what you see here on the right-hand side of the screen, which is an Etruscan tomb, an Etruscan tomb from the so-called
and I put this on the Monument List for you-- the Banditaccia Cemetery, which is at a site called Cerveteri, Cerveteri, a very important Etruscan site.
and this tomb we believe dates to the sixth century B. C.
Cerveteri is an extraordinary place to visit now because there is one tomb after another of this type.
you go into the site and you feel like you're on another planet or some such, as you wander among these extremely well-preserved tombs at Cerveteri.
and Cerveteri, by the way, is right off the highway, between Rome and Florence.
so it's a very easy site to get to and very well worthwhile;
there's nothing quite like it anywhere in Italy, anywhere indeed in the world.
and you see these series--and I've just chosen one here to show you-- you see these series of tombs, and I think if you look at it you'll see the similarity of this to the Mausoleum of Augustus.
these round Etruscan tombs have central burial chambers.
they have stone facing around the outermost part of the structure.
and you can see that piled on top of that is an earthen mound, and if you expand the size -- the Cerveteri tomb is much smaller.
actually the individual Cerveteri tombs are smaller than the Mausoleum of Augustus.
the Mausoleum of Augustus is 290 feet in diameter;it's a very large building.
but if you expand the size of one of these, what we call tumulus, t-u-m-u-l-u-s, tumulus tombs, at Cerveteri, if you expand the size, if you plant this with trees
because we know that the Mausoleum of Augustus was planted with trees on the earthen mound;
there's been quite a bit of controversy about what kind of trees.
for a long time people said cypress trees.
now people seem to favor juniper trees.
but whatever, trees of some sort, decorating that earthen mound.
so if you enlarge this, if you put some junipers on top of it, and if you stick a gleaming bronze statue of Augustus at the apex, you will have essentially the Mausoleum of Augustus.
so I'd like to suggest to you today that the Mausoleum of Augustus indicates to us that when it came to his tomb,
Augustus wanted to be buried like his Italian ancestors, like the Etruscans, and that is why he chose this particular type of tomb in Rome.
the Mausoleum of Augustus, like so many other monuments that we've been looking at this semester, survives in large part because it was re-used over the centuries in a wide variety of ways.
you can see in this engraving that it was used at one point as a garden, a very nicely manicured garden, as you can see inside the remains, inside those concentric circles, a very nice garden.
it was also used as a fortress at one point by the well-known Colonna family of Italy.
it was used, believe it or not, as a bull ring a little touch of Spain in the midst of Rome as a bull ring--and it was used most recently as a music hall.
it was a music hall before it was turned back into the Mausoleum of Augustus.
so again, this very--a very similar saga to this building and to its post-antique history, as to so many others that we've talked about.
another important point to make about the Mausoleum of Augustus is that, although Augustus intended it as his own last resting place, he didn't intend for him to be the only person who was laid to rest there.
he wanted this to serve as a family tomb, for him, his wife, his
well it turned out his daughter didn't end up there, but that may have been the intention originally, that she would.
she was discredited because of all the adulterous affairs she had and Augustus eventually banished her in 2 B. C.from Rome razed her house to the ground and did not allow her to be buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus.
but for his wife, for his nephew and son-in-law, Marcellus, and others, he wanted to create this family tomb where he, his family and presumably, since his objective was to create a dynasty presumably where his successors of the dynasty that he founded would also be laid to rest.
and there are inscription plaques that have come to light, from the Mausoleum of Augustus, and I can show you a couple of them here, that do indicate that was exactly the case.
we see this plaque over here, which actually has the name Marcellus inscribed there.
this is the Marcellus of the Theater of Marcellus, the nephew and son-in-law of Augustus, who was laid to rest in this Mausoleum.
his sister,"soror," Octavia, also laid to rest;
that is, Augustus' sister, Octavia, also laid to rest here.
and it continued to be used as a burial place again after Augustus' death and through the so-called Julio-Claudian emperors, who we'll look at next week:
Tiberius and Caligula and Claudius.
and we see, in fact, an inscription plaque over here that honors Agrippina the Elder:
Agrippina the Elder, the mother of Caligula, the third emperor of Rome, and it was Caligula who laid his mother to rest in this tomb.
so very much a family tomb created by the emperor Augustus.
and I should also mention, with regard to burial practice at this time, that everybody was--imperial individuals, and those lower on the social pyramid as well
were all cremated at this particular time.
so you have to imagine that there were urns for each of these inside the tomb somewhere as well.
now it may not surprise you to hear that once the emperor chose the form of his tomb, that he set in motion a fashion that just about every aristocrat wanted to follow.
so all of a sudden, after the construction of the Mausoleum of Augustus, again between 28 and 23, there is this efflorescence of round tombs in Rome and elsewhere in Italy.
and I want to show you just one example of that.
this is the so-called Tomb of Caecilia Metella. It dates to 20 B. C.
so it began to be put up not too long after Augustus' mausoleum was built.
it is located on the famous Via Appia in Rome, the Appian Way.
the Appian Way, which you see--this is a Google Earth image once again where you can see a stretch of the Appian Way, or the Via Appia, that is modern asphalt, although there are remains
and I'll show you later an example of this
there are remains of the polygonal masonry pavement that would have been there initially, looking very much like the pavement that we saw in Pompeii, for example.
and you can see the Tomb of Caecilia Metella right over here.
like the Mausoleum of Augustus, it was re-used in ancient times, and there was a fortress and a palace that was added to it.
and you can see also there, in a reddish earth color, the remains of that fortress and palace that abutted the mausoleum or the Tomb of Caecilia Metella.
and while this is on the screen, you can also see that while the tomb was essentially a cylindrical drum, resembling the cylindrical drum of the Mausoleum of Augustus, it was placed--it was given some height by being placed on a podium
the kind of podium that we saw at the sanctuaries, or the podium that we saw at the Villa of the Mysteries-- to raise it up.
it's not as big as those, but it's sizable, and it raises this round tomb up a little bit, so that it can be more readily seen as people make their way along the Via Appia.
the Mausoleum of Augustus does not have a similar podium.
so that's a unique, a different feature that is added to this particular structure.
you can also see there's an inscription on the front, and we'll talk about that in a moment, and then there are crenellations at the top.
there's some dispute about when those crenellations were added whether they belonged to the original tomb or not.
I think it's highly unlikely that they belonged to the original tomb, and they may have been added at the time that this was made into a fortress, as I've already mentioned.
this is a view of the Tomb of Caecilia Metella, as it looks today this tomb of this woman of 20 B. C. and you can see that it's actually quite well preserved, and we can get a very good sense of its original appearance.
you can see the concrete podium down here without its original facing; it was surely faced.
you can see the great cylindrical drum, of the Tomb of Caecilia Metella, and you can see the facing.
and, once again, the facing for this tomb, just as in the Mausoleum of Augustus, is not Luna or Carrara marble.
it is travertine, but very, very nicely cut travertine blocks, as you can see here.
very well done.
she was undoubtedly a well-to-do patron who was able to hire the best architects, the best artisans, and they have done an outstanding job of cutting that travertine.
you can see also that there is a frieze that encircles the monument at the uppermost part, right here, and that frieze depicts garlands and skulls of bulls, bucrania;
the same sort of thing that we saw in the inner precinct wall of the Ara Pacis.
although this pre-dates the Ara Pacis, so we can't say it was the influence of the Ara Pacis.
this is again 20, whereas the Ara Pacis wasn't begun until 13.
and it shows us that this motif was very much in the air, during the Augustan period, this motif of garlands hanging from bucrania, which of course makes reference to sacrifice, and it could be a sacrifice in honor of a funerary event, as well as anything else, and we again see that very well here.
one very interesting fact is that the frieze is not made out of travertine but out of pentelic marble, p-e-n-t-e-l-i-c.
pentelic marble is marble from Mount Pentelikon in Greece.
so it tells us that marble was imported from Greece, or marble that was imported from Greece was purchased and used for the frieze of this particular structure, and we'll see that it was used also for the inscription plaque.
so it tells us something.
it tells us that there was--that some patrons made the decision to spend a little more for the material for what they considered the most important part of the monument.
so in this case the most important part of the monument was the frieze, and also the inscription plaque that preserved this woman's name for posterity.
so they paid a little bit more in order to get that more expensive material for those critical details of the monument.
here's the inscription.
we're very fortunate that it's still preserved today.
we see it still inserted into the monument.
again, it's done in pentelic marble, and I think you can see, even in this view, the difference between pentelic marble and travertine.
travertine has more texture to it than the plainer marble, as you can see.
and her name is given here, Caecilia Metella: Caecilia Metella down here.
and it tells us that she was the daughter F, f-i-l-i-a, the daughter of Quintus Q.
Creticus--Creticus, C-r-e-t-i-c-u-s--who may have come from Crete; it's possible.
and it also makes reference to the fact that she was married to someone by the name of Crassus.
this may be Crassus the Elder; we're not absolutely sure.
but what it does indicate to us is this is an aristocratic woman.
this is an aristocratic woman whose family has a great deal of money, who are honoring her with this tomb, in the mode of the day;
which of course was the tomb type that was chosen by Augustus himself.
you may have noticed up here, in this same detail, not only the frieze that we've already described, with the garlands and bucrania, but that there is a relief here that represents a Roman trophy.
what is a Roman trophy?
what the Romans did at the end of battle, if they were victorious, is they went over to the nearest tree trunk on the battlefield and they took arms and armor from their defeated enemy and they tacked that arms and armor up on that tree trunk, to create a military trophy commemorating their victory, right on the battlefield.
and that's exactly what you see here, a tree trunk with a breastplate and a helmet and shields and so on, all tacked up to that trophy.
so we have to ask ourselves, what is that trophy doing on this particular monument?
it's highly unlikely that it refers to--there are some instances;
we do hear about woman trying to raise money for troops and so on and so forth.
but we don't--and even thinking that they might go into battle -- but for the most part Roman women did not participate in battle.
so it is highly unlikely that this refers to a military encounter that she had.
more likely it either refers to a military encounter of her father or her husband, or it may be a more generic reference to victory.
we've talked about the fact that in the minds of the Romans, the victory in battle, victory in the hunt, often were conflated with victory over death.
so it could be a more generic reference, but I would guess it may have something to do more specifically with the conquest of her husband or her father.
the structure today is just right there, out on the Via Appia; easy to see.
there is a small museum that isn't all that often open, but sometimes it is, that is in the remains of the fortress, and the palace next door.
you can see that the outside of the monument, they've inserted a lot of finds just from
it doesn't mean they came from the Tomb of Caecilia Metella but from this area on the Via Appia.
there were tons of Roman tombs out here, and all of this paraphernalia that you see, statuary and fragments of friezes and cornices and so on, all come in part possibly from this monument, but more likely from the other tombs in the area.
those have been inserted into the wall in a kind of interesting way.
and then here's the museum itself.
the museum doesn't have--the stuff that's in there is pretty much the same sort of thing that you see here.
but going into the museum is interesting because you can see into the central chamber of the Tomb of Caecilia Metella and see the concrete construction and so on.
I mentioned already that Roman tombs could be very eccentric indeed, and I want to show you one of the two most eccentric tombs, in my opinion, from ancient Rome that one can see in the city of Rome today.
and the first of these is the so-called Tomb of Cestius, because we believe--in fact, we're absolutely sure
that it honors a man by the name of Gaius, G-a-i-u-s Cestius, C-e-s-t-i-u-s; Gaius Cestius.
it was put up in 15 B. C.
that is in the age of the emperor Augustus.
in this Google Earth aerial view, we see what that structure looks like today.
it is a Roman tomb in the form of an Egyptian pyramid.
it's the only Roman tomb in the form of an Egyptian pyramid that we can see in Rome today, but we know there were others in antiquity.
we have reports that tell us that certain others that existed at a certain time were torn down, at one point.
there was one, for example, not far from the Vatican, that was torn down at one point because it got in the way of the street.
so this is not unique in the sense of the only one, although it is the only one still surviving today.
we have no idea how many of these there were.
there were certainly some.
whether there were a lot, we can't be absolutely certain.
but here it is, a Roman tomb, in the form of a pyramid.
now when it was first put up, it was put up outside the Servian Walls of the city, because all--as we've talked about the fact that by Roman law the necropolis or city of the dead needed to be located outside the walls of the city.
but as the city grew, and as there was a need for a new wall
and this happened in the third century A. D. and we'll talk about it way at the end of this semester-- the Romans ended up building a new wall, the famous Aurelian Walls.
and the circuit happened to be planned for this particular
to pass this particular point where the Tomb of Cestius was.
and fortunately they recognized the aesthetic and historical value of this tomb, and decided not to tear it down, but rather to incorporate it into the Aurelian Walls.
so what you see in this aerial view are two of the walls
two parts of the Aurelian Walls abutting, and in fact incorporating, the Pyramid of Cestius, but in antiquity--when it was first built, excuse me, it stood alone.
and what you see over here is a gateway that also belongs to the later Aurelian Walls.
so again, fortunately this particular tomb was preserved.
these two engravings are helpful in showing us that the inner core of the Tomb of Cestius was concrete, and the outer pyramidal shape was faced once again with travertine.
so travertine clearly the material of choice by aristocrats
because we're going to see that Cestius was also an aristocrat
for their tombs in the age of Augustus: concrete core, travertine facing.
and then if you look at this cutaway view over here, you will see that the burial chamber inside was very, very, very small; very, very, very small.
so small enough that there was not a lot of space for these burials;
but we'll see that we still believe that this too was a family tomb.
the burial chamber has had, and still has, remnants of painted walls.
and I show you an engraving here of those walls that was made when they were in somewhat better shape than they are today.
and I wondered if any of you--you're such experts now on First to Fourth Style Roman wall painting
if any of you could tell me--I'm sure all of you could tell me
what style painting is being used in the burial chamber of the Tomb of Cestius?
student: Third Style.
Prof: Third style. Why Third Style?
student: There's floating mythological features and very thin columns.
Prof: Very thin candelabra here, and mythological figures.
how are those used that make--that show that this is a typical Third Style wall?
student: They have a blackout laying around them and they're just floating around in space.
Prof: That's the word, floating.
they are floating in this random space, right in the center of the panels, as we know was characteristic of Third Style Roman wall painting.
so 15 B. C.Third Style Roman wall painting.
and if you think back to some of the palaces or villas that we looked at and their dates think of Boscotrecase for example, 11 B. C.
you see this is roughly contemporary to what's happening in Campania at this particular time.
and here are two details of the remains of those paintings, and you can see one of these floating mythological figures that looks like a victory figure:
female, winged, carrying a wreath over here, flying in the center of the panel.
this also shows you, in this case, the panels were white, very similar to the walls, for example, of the Third Style in the Domus Aurea in Rome.
and then here, this candelabrum, very attenuated, very delicate, that is used in place of columns;
both of these motifs decorating the flat wall that was so characteristic of Third Style Roman wall painting.
here's another view of the pyramid as it looks today.
you can see it is exceedingly well preserved, one of the best preserved of all Roman tombs.
you can see again the way in which the later wall was built into it and you can also see the travertine blocks and how carefully carved they were by the designers, by the artisans.
and here, this is very helpful, because it shows you that the
at least one, but I can tell you that two sides of the tomb, the eastern and western sides of the tomb, had in the center of the pyramid the name of Cestius.
that's how we know it was his tomb.
you see it here, Gaius Cestius. And it also includes all of his titles.
so he was very happy to advertise his titles on this monument, the purpose of which, of course, was for those who mourned him to feel proud of him and his achievements.
but even more important than that, from his point of view I am sure, and from the point of view of the Romans in general, was that his name and his deeds be preserved for posterity so that someday
in 2009, we're sitting in this classroom looking at this
we think back on Cestius, his title, what he did, what he achieved, and the way in which he was memorialized.
so this whole idea of preserving memory, not only in your own time, but into the far flung future.
this tomb, as I said, despite the fact that the burial chamber is small, we do believe it was a family tomb.
we have evidence for that, because two bases were found that seemed to belong to this tomb;
in fact, it's Cestius' name, or members of his family,
Cestius, you can see there, are named in these inscriptions.
these have markings on the top that suggest to us that statues stood on them, at one point.
so these were statue bases, probably placed right in front of the entrance to the pyramidal tomb.
and if you cast your eyes over this inscription you will not only see the name Cestius a few times but you will see another very important name, and that is M. Agrippa.
that's Marcus Agrippa, that's the Marcus Agrippa, the longtime--the boyhood friend and longtime close confidant and onetime heir and son-in-law of Augustus; all of those things.
he's mentioned here.
so he is a member also of this family.
so it demonstrates to us again we are dealing with an aristocratic family.
so all of those tombs I've shown you thus far
the Mausoleum of Augustus, the Tomb of Caecilia Metella, and the Tomb of Gaius Cestius
are all examples of aristocratic tomb architecture in the age of Augustus.
why did he choose a pyramid for his tomb is a very interesting question to ask, and I would suggest here--and it's not rocket science to figure this out at all
I would suggest here though that the reason has to do with
Augustus' very important victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31.
it was at that time, and even before, that an interest in things Egyptian came into Rome.
we saw that Augustus himself made reference to his victory over that pair, over Cleopatra and Mark Antony, in the complex with the Ara Pacis and the Mausoleum of Augustus, by inserting that obelisk in the center;
an obelisk that I have mentioned to you was actually brought from Egypt itself.
so these references to Egypt, initially under Augustus himself, had political import.
it was there to show that Augustus had been
that obelisk was there to show that Augustus had prevailed over
mark Antony and Cleopatra, and because he had prevailed, he could steal obelisks from Egypt and bring them back to decorate Rome, as trophies essentially.
so that was a political statement on his part.
but as time went on, Egyptomania became a kind of fashion statement.
I think that it caught on; it caught on after Egypt was made a Roman province in 30 B. C. right after Actium, and we begin to see this wave of things Egyptian spreading through Rome, and it's likely that Cestius--perhaps a combination of both, since he's from Agrippa's family, this combination of political reference, but also just this was an interesting-- this was the style at this particular point, to do things in the Egyptian manner.
you might remember some of those Egyptianizing motifs that we saw, for example, from the Black Room at Boscotrecase, which was also a villa that was closely connected with the imperial family.
you remember Agrippa Postumus who was the son of Agrippa himself, born by his wife Julia, after Agrippa's death; hence his name.
another view of the back of the Pyramid of Cestius, the Mausoleum of Cestius, which again shows us how well preserved it is.
you can see the Aurelian Walls, you can see the gate that we looked at before, and you can also see that the back is actually in a modern cemetery.
this is the so-called Protestant Cemetery, and if you are in Rome and have time this is one of the most interesting places to visit.
it's again a bit off the beaten track.
not that many tourists go there, but those that do are rewarded, because it's a cemetery where many expatriates were buried -- people who flocked to Rome because they loved it.
authors, scholars, poets, painters came to Rome, ended up spending the rest of their lives there
coming from all different countries around the world
spending the rest of their lives there, dying there, and eventually being buried in the so-called Protestant Cemetery.
Percy Bysshe Shelley, for example, is buried there, as is John Keats.
and the Keats tomb, Keats marker, is my favorite by far in this cemetery.
you can see his tombstone here, which doesn't even give his name, it just identifies him;
and you'll remember he died very, very young, in his early twenties I think it was.
you see him here referred to only as "the young English poet.
and down below it says, "Here lies one whose name was writ in water.
it's an amazing stone.
it does show the lyre, which makes reference, of course, to the fluency and so on of his mellifluous poetry.
and over here, a companion of his, Joseph Severn, who doesn't hesitate to mention his relationship to John Keats.
so you see Keats' name in Severn's tombstone but not in Keats' own tombstone.
but I show this to you just because it's one of those more fascinating places in Rome.
and many of the tombs, by the way
there are many tombstones here that clearly are based on ancient Roman prototypes.
so it's a fascinating place to wander.
and by the way, you can do that in our own Grove Street Cemetery, where there are a number of tombs that are done very much in the Roman style.
if you think the Tomb of Cestius is unusual, the weirdest tomb by far in Rome, from ancient Rome, is the one that I turn to now, and this is the Tomb of the baker Eurysaces, the Tomb of the baker Eurysaces that was put up in Rome in the late first century B. C.
and that again is another tomb from the age of Augustus.
but in this case we believe, although the inscription doesn't tell us this for sure, but we believe it is highly likely that Eurysaces is from a different level of Roman society, not an aristocrat, but a working man who probably
either he himself or his family were slaves originally, eventually freed.
he takes up the profession of bread making and he ends up building this extraordinary tomb that I'm going to show you in some detail, in Rome.
as we look at this particular view, we see the Tomb of Eurysaces, as it looks today; it's right over here.
we see it has behind it a great travertine gate, which is actually later in date.
it dates to the time of the emperor Claudius.
we'll talk about it next week.
so you have to think that away for the moment.
that was not standing when the Tomb of Eurysaces was put up.
you can also see, however, that this gate was placed in an aqueduct system.
that aqueduct was begun during the time of Augustus.
so you can imagine that at least some of that aqueduct system stood at the time that this tomb was built.
the tomb, as you can see here, was a three-storied structure, very eccentric in its appearance.
the ground line today is much lower than the modern ground line.
so you have to go right up to the monument.
you can look down at the first story.
so you're only seeing a part of the first story here.
you can see that it is made of tufa blocks.
you can also see the interior is concrete, the core of the structure is concrete, and then on the second and third stories, the tomb is faced with travertine.
so travertine again used for tomb facing in the age in Augustus.
and we see this very unusual design where there are these great--not piers--cylinders, great cylinders;
great cylinders that are placed here vertically, and then cylinders placed in the next tier horizontally.
vertically placed cylinders. They're not columns.
you don't see any capitals. They're very fat.
so they are cylinders, vertically, and then horizontally.
and some scholars have suggested, and I think quite convincingly, that these may actually make reference to what were grain measures.
grain measures were these cylindrical structures in silos, in a sense, in which they stored grain in ancient Roman times.
so that is very possible, since we know that this man was a baker, that this may make reference to these grain storage cylinders that were used in the process of baking.
with regard to the siting of the tomb--this is particularly interesting
I show you this plan over here, which indicates to us
here you can actually see the plan of the Tomb of Eurysaces, and you can see that it is very unusual in shape.
it is trapezoidal in shape. Why is it trapezoidal in shape?
it probably is trapezoidal in shape because the tomb was located on a piece of property that was between two major roads of Rome that exited and entered the city at this particular point:
the so-called Via Labicana and the Via Praenestina.
so two major Roman roads that come into the city at this point.
and remember, the Tomb of Eurysaces, like all Roman tombs during this period, was outside the Servian Walls, so built outside the walls, but between these two streets.
now this model over here, which by the way comes from a museum in Rome that again is off the beaten track, but I can highly recommend the Museo Civilit? Romana which is in a building built by Mussolini in the 1930s for a World's Fair, and the buildings--and it and other buildings like it out there, in a place--part of Rome that we call EUR from Esposizione Universale di Roma, E-U-R, EUR.
that whole area built up by Mussolini for the World's Fair.
but the buildings were so substantial that they decided to keep them, and they still stand, and this museum was placed in one of them.
it is a museum of casts, where you can go and see works of Roman art and architecture from not only Rome but from around the world, all in one place.
now they're not originals, they're casts, but it'd be a great place to study for the exam for this course, for example, because you can walk around and see so many of the buildings that we've talked about.
and there are these wonderful models of many of them.
and we see here a model of this aqueduct, the later gate here, and the Tomb of Eurysaces.
and this shows you very well the way in which these two streets,
and this--it is clear that Eurysaces
and I'll tell you how he did this in a moment
had enough money that he was able to buy what was certainly one of the most choice pieces of real estate, outside the walls of Rome, one in which everyone who came into Rome
this is a man who wanted to be remembered for posterity.
it's another example of how tombs were used for the purposes of retaining memory over time.
this is also interesting because it shows what happened.
what you see with the dotted lines here is one of these later gates that was made for the Aurelian Walls.
and in this case, the Tomb of Eurysaces was right smack dab in the middle of where they wanted to build an outcropping of this wall.
in this case they decided that they were not going to build the wall into it, but that they were going to build the wall on top of it.
but fortunately, again, they did not destroy it completely.
but they allowed the debris to fall into the tower, and then they covered it up.
so when this tower was eventually torn down to free the Tomb of Eurysaces, they found the fourth wall and the debris from that wall, including a portrait statue and an inscription inside the debris, which was extremely fortunate, and which allows us to reconstruct the monument.
here you see the model in this EUR Museum that shows you what the tomb looked like in antiquity.
you see the three levels, the three tiers.
you see the entrance to the burial chamber here.
but we can again reconstruct it from those remains.
and you see them here, and you see it was relatively plain on three tiers, except for a portrait statue of Eurysaces and his wife, an inscription down below.
and you need to think away the frieze up there, because the frieze was probably not on this side of the monument, although there was a frieze around the other three sides.
you can see one of those sides here, and I'll show that frieze to you momentarily.
this is a view of the tomb again, where we can see so well those cylinders on two stories.
and you can also see here that in the area between the vertical and the horizontal cylinders, on three sides of the monument there is an inscription, and it repeats over and over again, and it tells us that this monument was put up by Eurysaces,
Marcus Vergilius Eurysaces, who was pistor and redemptor-- p-i-s-t-o-r, r-e-d-e-m-p-t-o- r--pistor and redemptor.
that means master baker and contractor
the contractor is the most important part--master baker and contractor.
we know this is a man who made bread and sold it to the Roman armies.
this was a pretty lucrative thing to do in the age of Augustus when there was so much military conquest.
he made a fortune selling bread to the Roman armies, and it is with that fortune that he was able to buy this choice piece of real estate and to put up this extraordinary monument in the late first century B. C.
the portrait relief still survives.
it's in the Capitoline Museums today. You see it here.
it had fallen in again to the debris, from the fourth side, but here it is with Eurysaces standing next to his wife, Atistia
we know her name and I'll tell you how in a moment--Atistia, in that portrait relief.
and we're not going to go into this in any detail, but if you compare it to the figures of Augustus and his family, from the Ara Pacis,
I think you'll agree with me that the Ara Pacis is serving as a model, and that this portrait group is clearly based on aristocratic
even though this is probably a middle-class pair, formerly from a slave family, freed people.
they are shown here very much as if they are members of the court, wearing similar costumes, depicted in a similar way, with similar hairstyles.
and I point to just one detail.
if you look at this view of Livia, on the Ara Pacis, Augustus' wife, and you see the wonderful way in which the artist has depicted her hand, the shape of her hand showing underneath her garment here;
the same is done here for Atistia, you can see--and that's A-t-i-s-t-i-a--for Atistia.
you can see her hand.
in fact, it's even better done here because you can see the shape of the knuckles and so on, underneath the garment, the very diaphanous garment that she wears.
so clearly a very special portrait artist, probably hired to do these portraits;
a portrait artist who may have been hired at great expense.
and also very significant, and in keeping with what we saw for the Tomb of Caecilia Metella, is the fact that although the tomb is faced in travertine and the relief around the monument is in travertine, this is done in marble, in, if I remember correctly, Greek marble, as well.
so imported marble that is brought from elsewhere and at greater expense is used for the most important portrait relief.
the scenes around the--the scenes, the frieze scenes, are particularly interesting because they depict in the greatest of detail the profession of the making of bread.
they depict Eurysaces' daily achievement of making bread that he sold to the Roman armies.
I'm going to just show you the scenes very quickly, and you can see the style is very different.
it's a much more journalistic style, with figures that don't have the elegant proportions that we saw in the portrait relief, and it is carved on travertine, not on marble.
we see here the grain being ground between two stones, and we see the way in which these men in tunics worked that.
we also see that the upper stone is rotated by a mule that is attached to a wooden handle that comes off the uppermost stone there.
we have millstones just like this, from Pompeii, and I show you the actual millstones.
so these depictions on the Tomb of Eurysaces:
very accurate in terms or what millstones looked like in antiquity.
another scene here in which we see two men at a table with big gobs of dough, that you can see here, dough, for the bread.
another scene--this is one of the more important scenes--where we see four men standing behind a table, that are forming that dough into loaves.
and over here a magistrate, who has a short-sleeved but long garment, is supervising them.
and the four men are very interestingly rendered because they're rendered almost exactly the same.
if you look, if you compare this to the Ara Pacis where figures are represented in different postures, a lot of variety clearly based on Greek prototypes.
here we see something very different.
the major objective of the artist is to get the story across, to show these men making these loaves.
but look at them.
each one--they're bare chested, and we'll see why they're bare chested.
it's hot in this part of the bakery.
so they've taken off their shirts.
there's some attempt to depict their musculature.
but they're essentially shown in exactly the same way, the same curly hair, almost as if they were cut from a cookie cutter, because again it's not the form that's of interest to the artist here, but getting that narrative across.
and if you try to figure out whose legs belong to whom, believe me, you'll have a difficult time of it.
so the artist is not--is much less concerned with formal things than he is with getting the story across.
with regard to why they've taken off their shirts, they're right near the oven.
and I show you the scene that depicts the dome-shaped oven in which the loaves are being baked, and you can see that this oven looks very much like a modern pizza oven, and in fact the pole that they use, the wooden pole with the flat end, is just the sort of thing you see at BAR or any other major pizza place, either in New Haven or elsewhere in the world.
and, in fact, these dome-shaped ovens are still used in rural areas.
and I took this view in Greece, in a small rural town, and you see these in Italy in some very small towns as well, still being done in exactly the same way.
there are a number--because of the cylinders on the Tomb of Eurysaces, there are some scholars who've suggested that the Tomb of Eurysaces is in the form of a bakery .
while I do believe that there is reference to those grain
to those storage bins, silos that were used for the storage of grain,
I do not think that the Tomb of Eurysaces is in the form of an oven.
it makes reference to baking, but I don't think it's in the form of an oven, because this is what Roman ovens looked like.
they were dome-shaped.
this has a very different appearance, as you can see.
perhaps the most important scene in the frieze is this one, where we see two--we see the loaves have been baked, they're ready to go to market, and they're put in these large baskets-- you can see them here
and then they are weighed in this scale, in this ancient scale.
and I think this is a form of private propaganda on the part of the baker Eurysaces.
what he is telling the public who gaze up on this tomb, not only in his own day but for posterity, is: "My bread was always, not only of high quality, but of the appropriate weight.
I never cheated the public. I treated you fairly.
I was an honest baker and contractor.
I think that's what the message is here.
and, in fact, you may think this is a stretch, but I think that one could easily compare this report that Eurysaces provides of his profession on the frieze of this tomb as a kind of baker's version of Augustus' Res Gestae.
the list of things accomplished during his life is laid out in narrative form, for not only his contemporaries but for posterity to see.
the portrait group again--and I mentioned that there was an inscription found with that portrait group;
a very interesting inscription which tells us that Eurysaces put up this monument to his wife Atistia, and Atistia's bodily remains, he says, are buried in hoc panario--in hoc panario, in this panarium.
what is a panarium?
a breadbasket; which is again why scholars have said, "Well the whole tomb is in the form of an oven.
but I think the breadbasket being referred to here is not the tomb, but rather the urn in which Atistia's remains were placed.
in the excavation in the nineteenth century, when that later gateway was removed, they found one urn, one urn, not two urns, one urn, presumably the urn of Atistia, and that urn was in the form--it was drawn at that time.
and we can see this view of it here, a cross-section, the lid, and the main body of the urn.
and you can see it looks like a breadbasket.
and I show you--we have lots of examples of urns in the form of breadbaskets from Roman times.
there's one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and any of you who are going down there anytime soon to look at Roman antiquities and other things, you can see one there.
this one is in the National Museum in Rome.
and women's remains were often placed in breadbaskets to accentuate or to speak to their domestic virtues, if they were good at taking care of the house and baking bread and so on.
but in this particular case I think it is much more likely that the reference here is not to her, to Atistia's cleverness as a housekeeper, but rather to her husband's profession, which is very, very interesting in terms of what it tells us about the gender wars of antiquity, that here's a tomb that has been put up by this baker, with his money that he's made from his profession, in honor of his wife.
but what he depicts -- what he is preserving for posterity is not the outline of his wife's life, but the outline of his life, what he has accomplished.
his name is plastered on three sides of the monument.
he's got three sides of the monument with the successive phases of the baking of bread in all of its aspects.
Yes, he has a very nice portrait relief of his wife, but of course he's standing by her side.
and he does mention her namedown below. So he gives her some due.
but this monument, as far as posterity is concerned, is about Eurysaces and not about his wife, and I think it tells us again very--a great deal about the motives of this particular individual.
I want to say just a very few words about two other tombs out on the Via Appia in Rome, the Appian Way again.
and I show you a view of the Via Appia, as it looks today.
you can see that although much of the road is modern, you do find bits and pieces of ancient ground out there.
you can see some polygonal blocks here and some rut marks from the ancient road, and you have to be very careful when you drive out there in your Cinquecento, or whatever--or you bike ride out there, as this fellow is doing, or you take your motorbike or whatever
because if you're going too quickly and you don't expect it, all of a sudden you hit some ancient road, and that makes a huge difference in terms of your ability to move forward.
I want to show you one tomb, very fleetingly, out there, which is the one that you see over here on the left-hand side of the screen.
there are remains of many tombs on the Via Appia.
most of them are just piles of concrete, but a few of them are better preserved, and this is one of them.
it's a tomb of freedmen and freedwomen from 13 B. C. to A. D.5.
we call it the Rabirius Tomb because of an inscription that tells us members of the Rabirius family were buried here.
the reason that I show it to you is that the eccentric tombs that I've shown you today are absolutely marvelous and tell us a lot about the Romans as patrons and their desires Vis--vis memory.
but it is not--those are not the conventional tomb types.
we see many more of this sort of thing, which we call a house tomb, a tomb that resembles a house essentially.
either vertical or horizontal, but these horizontal ones represent members of the family.
some may be deceased, some may not be deceased.
the message is that even if someone has died before another, that they will eventually be re-united together in perpetuity.
but if you look at this carefully, you will see that what it looks like is as if these individuals are still alive and looking out of the window of their tomb, as if out of the window of a house;
this very close association in the minds of the Romans between houses of the living and houses of the dead.
and that is absolutely the case here.
and you'll remember, we can trace this all the way back to the eighth century B. C.
you remember the Villanovan hut urn that I showed you, and I told you that women's remains were placed in
women's cremated remains--were placed in these huts that resembled Romulus' huts.
and so this whole idea of a house serving as a tomb goes way back, and continues to be a leitmotif of Roman tomb architecture throughout the entire history of Roman architecture, and it's something that I hope you'll keep in mind.
also just in passing, I want to mention--we've looked--the tombs that we've looked at thus far today have been
they've been of all different social classes, from emperor to freed slave, but at the same time they have all been tombs, including the Rabirius Tomb, of the well-to-do.
if these were freed slaves, they were ones that made a fortune, like Eurysaces did selling bread to the Roman army, and with that fortune were able to build monumental tombs, at great expense.
but there were lots and lots of people obviously, who lived in Rome and Pompeii and in other cities who could not afford those kinds of tombs, and you might be asking yourselves,"Where are all of those people buried?
well they tended to be buried underground, in what we call columbaria -- c-o-l-u-m-b-a-r-i-a, columbaria--underground burial chambers, that were either burial clubs that you could join for a small amount of money;
you could join one of these clubs, buy into your last resting place that way.
or they were burial chambers that were created by the very well to do, for example, the emperor and empress, Augustus and Livia.
we know they had thousands of slaves, literally thousands of slaves.
we have a record of some of Livia's slaves.
she had slaves, not only to tend the garden and that kind of thing, but she had a masseuse, she had several hairstylists, and she even had a slave, we know, who set her pearls, that was her whole job was to set her pearls, day in and day out.
so they had tons and tons of slaves, and some of those very well to do also established these burial areas where their slaves could find a last resting place.
and, in fact, the one that I show you here, the Vigna Codini, is one such, that belonged to the Augustan-Julio-Claudian family and was used for the remains of some of their slaves.
and you can see that each individual had a little niche;again, people were cremated.
the cremated remains were placed usually in an urn, that was placed inside one of these niches, and then there would be a small inscription, referring to the deceased.
so this gives you a sense again of those who could not afford individual tombs and how they were buried.
in the five or seven minutes that remain,
I'd like to switch gears entirely and look at something very different, as a prelude to what we'll be talking about next time, because next time, next Tuesday, we are going to return once again to innovative Roman architecture;
architecture made of concrete and with a variety of interesting innovations.
we'll do that next week, as I said.
and I want to give you an introduction to that by turning to this one example from the Augustan period that is noteworthy enough for us to say something about it.
what you're looking at here is the plan of what was a spa essentially, in ancient Roman times.
it's located in Campania, at a place called Baia, so in the vicinity of Pompeii and Herculaneum and Oplontis and Boscotrecase and so on.
we've already talked about the fact that that was an area that was a mecca for the well-to-do, the glitteratti from Rome who went down there for their vacations.
it was a resort area.
many of them had villas along what is now the Amalfi Coast.
others had villas on the Island of Capri.
I can't remember if I told you but Augustus and Tiberius, his successor, owned twelve villas on the Island of Capri, one of which we'll look at next time.
and this was an area also where there were sulfur springs and mineral baths, and so the natural thing to do, for those who were coming here, as a resort, was to create for them a place that they could go to relax and enjoy the thermal springs and the sulfur baths and so on and so fort, and that was this place, this spa, at Baia, which consisted of a bunch of thermal structures that were terraced out over a hillside.
you have to think of the Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia at Palestrina, turned into a spa.
because they treated it--architecturally it was done in exactly the same way.
they took a hillside, they terraced that hillside, they poured concrete on that hillside, creating a whole host of interesting structures in which one could relax and get away from it all.
you see a plan of that spa here and the way in which it was terraced, via concrete construction, over this hillside.
I am only going to show you one thermal bath from it, and it's this one that we see over here.
it is the so-called "Temple of Mercury"-- that's what the locals have long called it.
it is not a Temple of Mercury, it is a thermal bath, but nonetheless we call it that because it's been called that for such a long time.
as you look at the plan of the Temple of Mercury, you're going to say to me--every one of you will say the same thing, "What's the origin of this?
clearly the design is based on the frigidaria of Pompeii, the frigidarium or the cold room of Pompeii, this round structure with the radiating alcoves that we saw as part of bath architecture very early on, second century B. C.and so on, in Pompeii.
same scheme used here. Not surprising.
this is in Campania, it's not far away.
I can show you the Temple of Mercury is extremely well preserved.
we can see the dome of the Temple of Mercury, made out of concrete construction, from above.
you can see the oculus of the--just as those frigidaria had oculi, this one does as well, and you can see that extremely well here.
so a concrete building, with a concrete dome, used as part of this spa.
we've traced this desire to make round structures way back to the 600s B. C.the time of Quinto Fiorentino.
I showed you this Etruscan attempt at making a round structure, with a dome, that was done, in this case, in stone, and although it was a valiant attempt, not all that successful.
and we talked about the way in which that eventually transformed into the Roman ability to make the frigidaria at Pompeii.
and here are two views of the Temple of Mercury at Baia, as it looks today.
because of the oculus, there is often rain water.
the drain no longer functions.
so there's often a lot of very unappealing green water that accumulates in the base of the Temple of Mercury.
so the times that I've been there, every time I think I've been there, there's been enough water in there that I haven't been able to actually get pictures of the alcoves, which are covered by these inches and inches of water that are usually collected inside the Temple of Mercury.
but you get a good sense, I think, of it here nonetheless, that we're talking about a round domed structure, with an oculus, with some windows, with arcuated windows, windows with arcuations at the top, in the uppermost part, or toward the uppermost part of the dome, to add additional light into the system.
and you need to think of these, by the way, as much more ornate in antiquity than they are today.
they would have been stuccoed over, which you can see, and then probably decorated with mosaic.
so the wonderful effects of the light coming in, hitting the mosaic, and then there would've been a pool in the center, just as there was in the frigidarium, around which people could sit.
it would've been a quite spectacular space.
and just a few more views, to end with today.
this one up here, which of course is the frigidarium at Pompeii to show you where all of this begins.
these two views are of the Temple of Mercury at Baia.
and this one, of course, of the Pantheon, which is where we're headed.
but I think these in particular of the Temple of Mercury at Baia again give you a sense of the way in which light not only flows into this system
again, imagine it on mosaic ceiling and mosaic walls;
spectacular effects, the way it would have glittered in the light.
but look especially at the way the shapes that are formed on the water that would have been in the pool down below.
it's exactly the same sort of sense that you get when you walk into the Pantheon today, which also makes circles on the floor of the pavement.
so we're going to again return to these kinds of issues next week.
I just wanted you to be aware of this intermediate step between the frigidaria of Pompeii and some of the buildings that we're going to be looking at in the next couple of weeks.
take care. Thank you, and Happy alentine's Day.
Prof: Good morning everyone.
Augustus founded the Julio-Claudian dynasty.
the Claudian for the Claudian side of the family.
that was Augustus' wife from--her side of the family, excuse me, the Claudian side of the family.
and there were four emperors in the Julio-Claudian dynasty.
these were Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero.
every one of them, all four, made an important contribution to the evolution of Roman architecture, and we'll talk about the contributions of those four today.
but we'll also see that the single most important contribution, from the standpoint of Roman architecture, was by Nero, the notorious emperor Nero, which is why I do call this lecture "Notorious Nero and His Amazing Architectural Legacy.
an architectural legacy that would have been impossible without some of the earlier concrete constructions that we've already discussed, specifically the frigidaria of Pompeii and also the thermal bath at Baia, which I remind you of here.
the so-called Temple of Mercury, we see it again with its dome made out of concrete construction, a view from the exterior.
and down here, at the left, a view of the interior of the monument, and I remind you of the way in which is that designed so that light streams through the oculus in the dome, down onto the sides of the wall, creating light effects:
a circle that corresponds to the shape of the opening above, and then falling initially on the pool of water that would have been located there, as well as across the walls, which probably would have been-- that were certainly stuccoed over
and probably would have been covered with mosaic.
so a very spectacular interior indeed, and one again that had an important impact, as we'll see, on the architectural designs of the Roman emperor Nero.
I want to begin though with the first of the Julio-Claudian emperors, and that is with Tiberius.
and you see a portrait of Tiberius now on the screen, just to give you a sense of what he looked like.
Tiberius, again the son of Livia by a former marriage, the elder son of Livia by a former marriage, who becomes emperor of Rome right after Augustus.
and the portrait that you see here is a marble portrait of Tiberius that is now in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptothek in Copenhagen.
Tiberius was emperor of Rome from 14 to 37 A. D. and with regard to architecture, he completed projects begun by Augustus.
he also was responsible for restoring Republican buildings that had fallen into severe disrepair by his reign, and this included several temples, a basilica, warehouses, and also a theater.
Tiberius also initiated some new building projects in Rome.
these included a Temple to the Divine Augustus, Temple to Divus Augustus, his divine adoptive father, because Augustus was made a god, as Caesar had been before him, at his death.
Tiberius also put up a series of arches to his relatives, and also a camp for the Praetorian Guard.
but what we'll see about Tiberius is that his real passion was not the public architecture that Augustus had been so fond of
think the Forum of Augustus and the Temple of Mars Ultor, or the Ara Pacis Augustae, which were among Augustus' most important building projects.
Tiberius was interested instead in private architecture
architecture in a sense for himself and his nearest and dearest
and he began a palace on the Palatine Hill.
he did not think the small, modest House of Augustus, despite the fact that it had those nicely painted walls, he did not think that that befit his own grandeur, and he began a major palace on the Palatine Hill on the northwest side of the Palatine Hill.
and he renovated and built villas elsewhere, outside of Rome especially on the spectacular Island of Capri.
and indeed, during the reign of Augustus, and also the reign of Tiberius, that family, the Augustan and Julio-Claudian family, built twelve villas--count them, twelve villas
on the Island of Capri, one more spectacular than the next.
it's worth mentioning, by the way, that Augustus' taste, even in villas, was somewhat more modest than Tiberius.
Augustus used to decorate his villa, we are told, with dinosaur bones and things like that, of historical interest whereas Tiberius spared no expense in introducing every luxury possible into his villas.
with regard to the palace on the Palatine Hill, the so-called Domus Tiberiana, I just want to mention it in passing.
there's very little that survives of the substructures that Tiberius was responsible for beginning, for that palace.
they were made out of concrete construction, and you can see here what's called the Clivus Palatinus, which is a ramp way leading from the Roman Forum, up to the Palatine Hill.
and you can see some of the remains of those substructures over here.
the ones that we see were probably restored later and may or may not date to the Tiberian period, but they give you some idea of the sort of construction that he began on the Palatine Hill.
and I mention this just because we'll see that Caligula and some of the other emperors continued to add to this palace, and then the entire Palatine Hill is redesigned by the emperor Domitian in the late first century A. D.
much more interesting and much more--and there's much more information for us to look at
are the villas on the island of Capri.
and I'm going to show you one, the best preserved, from that island, the so-called Villa Jovis:
the Villa Jovis, the Villa of Jupiter, which is an interesting name, when you think about it, for a villa for the emperor Tiberius.
the Villa Jovis, which was put up sometime in the years in which Tiberius was emperor; that is, from 14 to 37 A. D.
it's a spectacular place, beautifully situated.
and I'm going to take you there today.
now the only way to get to the island of Capri, which by the way is one of my very favorite places in the world;
I don't know how many of you've been there, but it's quite extraordinary--the island of Capri.
you can't jet to the Island of Capri, you have to arrive there by boat, and most people take a boat, unless they have a private yacht, but those of us who don't, have to take a boat either from Naples, usually a hydrofoil although they have larger boats as well
a hydrofoil from Naples or from Positano.
and I actually show you--this is a view on the left-hand side of the screen of Positano on the Amalfi Coast.
you go down to the beach; there's a place where you can pick up a hydrofoil.
it takes a very short time, half an hour or so, less, a little bit less, to get over to the Island of Capri from Positano.
so we're sitting on one of those hydrofoils
or at least eight of us are, because that's usually what they fit
and we're making our way from Positano toward Capri.
as you go there, if the weather is good enough, and if the sea is calm enough, they will take you to see the famous grottos, the Green Grotto and also the Blue Grotto.
and again I can just give you a little sense here of--in this view--of how blue is blue.
I mean, it's really a neon blue, when you go to see the Blue Grotto.
it's a spectacular sight and a very special color blue that you really don't see anywhere else in the world.
so they'll drive you around in the hydrofoil to see the grottos, and then you eventually get to the dock at Capri, and this is what you see as you get off the boat at the island of Capri:
again a very beautiful spot to visit.
as you go up, you make your way from the dock up to the funicular.
you take the funicular up to the main part of town, and one of the first things you see is the popular Bar Tiberio.
I show it to you, not to--it's a fun place to go
but I show it to you mainly because it's one of these examples of the way in which the Roman emperors have had a lasting impact, even today, that so many of these bars and restaurants and so on are named for Rome's emperors, or for some of the monuments that we've been studying in the course of this semester.
and this bar is no exception, and in fact if you go through the doors that lead into the interior of the bar, you will see a portrait of Tiberius etched on the doorway.
so Tiberius very much lives and thrives in the center of downtown Capri still today.
what most tourists go to Capri to see, besides just to walk around a magnificent island and to test out some of the beaches, which tend to be on the rocky side, is to see the most famous rocks of Capri.
and these are the so-called Faraglioni. You see them here.
you go up to the so-called Gardens of Augustus, and then up to a spot where you can see these particularly well.
they're magnificent.
they are the landmark spot on the island of Capri, and they have survived coastal landslides and sea erosion, to look as wonderful as they still do today.
and this is, of course, the photo op on the island.
I don't think there's anyone who visits Capri who doesn't take a photo or have a photo taken of themselves at the Faraglioni.
the villa that I want to show you is again the best preserved villa of Tiberius on Capri.
and again I mentioned that it's called the Villa Jovis, and it dates to 14 to 37 A. D.
it's a trek to get up there. You have to walk essentially.
the streets are such that there are no cabs or cars that can get you there.
you have to make it on your own. And there are two paths.
I've made the mistake of taking the more arduous path, which looks like this, to get up to the top, but there's another path also that takes you by some very attractive houses and villas, which are fun to see.
and you will see the largest lemons
has anyone ever been on the island of Capri?
you'll see the largest lemons on Capri, as well as on the Amalfi Coast in general, that you've ever seen anywhere:
gigantic lemons on lemon trees, as you make your way up to the Villa of the Villa Jovis.
now here is a plan of the Villa Jovis, as well as a cross-section, from the Ward-Perkins textbook.
and if we look first at the cross-section, at the uppermost part of the screen, you will see the way this building was made.
you will see that the architects have taken advantage of developments in concrete construction to create a series of barrel vaults in tiers, and those barrel vaults in tiers are where-- are the cisterns of the villa, where the water was kept to supply the baths and the kitchen and so on, of the villa.
you see those there, and in this plan down here you can see the cisterns again and the way in which a pavement has been placed on top of those tiers of barrel vaults, to create a very large court here.
the entranceway into Tiberius' villa on Capri was over here.
you can see a series of columns, four in total, that you see as you make your way into the entranceway of the villa.
along this side of the villa, which is the southern side of the villa, you see the baths--not surprisingly placed on the southern side
extensive bath structure for the emperor.
on the western side you see a series of rooms that are for the entourage of Tiberius.
the kitchen is located on this side as well.
and then perhaps the most important room of the house, from our standpoint, the hall or the aula--a-u-l-a--the aula of Tiberius' villa at Capri.
and you can see the shape of that aula.
it's a kind of hemicycle with large picture windows that allow views that lie outside.
and it should remind you of the second phase of the Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii, where we also saw that attractive bay window with the panoramic views, out beyond.
the panoramic views were much more spectacular here than even from the Villa of the Mysteries, because as I think you can see also from this site plan, that this is located right at the edge of a promontory.
it's in fact 1, 095 feet above sea level, and you get some incredible views of the sea and of other islands from this location.
on this side, the northern side of the structure, is where the apartments of Tiberius were located;
a series of rooms for the emperor himself, and including also an imperial loggia, where he could walk out and get some attractive panoramas privately on his own.
you can also see that there is a corridor that leads from the private apartment to this very long walkway, that is located right at the edge of the cliff on this side.
this is called technically an ambulatio --a-m-b-u-l-a-t-i-o, an ambulatio--and it was just for that.
it was for taking pleasant walks, getting nice views of the sea from there, especially for the emperor and special invited guests.
and right in the center was a triclinium--you see it right here--a triclinium or dining room where the emperor could dine and could look out again over views that were possible from this particular locale.
this is a view unfortunately in black and white, but it's the only one that I have that gives you a sense of the remains today from above, the extent of those remains.
and you can see again the concrete construction I think quite well from this, as well as the fact that although all the foundation walls are there, there's no decoration, the ceilings are missing, and so on and so forth.
you see the cistern here, the location of the aula up here, the area for the entourage of Tiberius, and the private apartment on that side.
a church and a statue on a base were added later, and so of course you need to think those away.
this is a view of some of the remains as they look today, just to give you a sense that when you're actually up there and wandering around.
the walls don't go up all that far, but you can also see that they do preserve the entire plan of the structure, which is why we have such a good idea of what it looked like in antiquity and how all of those pieces fit together.
you can see that the construction is concrete and the facing is stone, irregular stonework, the kind of opus incertum work that we've seen elsewhere in Campania.
because remember this is an island, but it's off the coast of Naples, Pompeii and Oplontis;
it is in that same general area of Italy.
and this is one view and one--I have many more spectacular ones than this one
but this is one that gives you a sense of the sort of thing you can see.
this one I took right from, I think from near the aula;
just to give you an idea of what you see from there.
beautiful views of the sea.
in some areas you can see the rocky outcroppings as you look down, and then views of some other islands in the area, for example Ischia, and so on.
the successor to Tiberius was a man by the name of Caligula.
Caligula became emperor at the death of Tiberius.
and we see a portrait of him here, on the right-hand side of the screen, just again to give you a sense of the man.
he had a very short--he was very young when he became emperor of Rome--he had a very short reign, only three years.
and he was somewhat unbalanced, and it was not long after he became emperor
Oh, by the way, he was very popular when he was a boy;
he was a prince, very popular.
he used to run around the military camps with his family, in a little military costume, and he wore these distinctive military boots called the caliga, c-a-l-i-g-a;
which is how he got the nickname Caligula, from those boots.
he was extremely popular with everyone, and everyone was quite excited when he became emperor of Rome.
but his power went to his head.
he became a despot, and he spent most of his time cavorting with his three sisters.
I show you them here on a coin, and they're all named:
Agrippina, Julia, and--Drusilla was his favorite, so of course she's in the center there-- Drusilla.
and he also did strange things like conduct faux wars essentially, faux wars with faux enemies:
for example, his war against Britain, so to speak.
and he also spent a good deal of time trying to work it out so that his horse, Incitatus, could become a senator.
so this gives you some idea of the kind of man we're dealing with here.
he was occupied with all of that and really not that much with architecture.
and again, he was only emperor for a very short time, so there was a limit to what kinds of architectural contributions he could make.
but he didn't make none.
I mean, he made some, and in fact one of them is particularly important, and I want to emphasize those to you here.
so again, Caligula was emperor between 37 and 41 A. D.
he had little public building.
again, he continued the tradition of Tiberius, and that is in having much more interest in private villa architecture than in public architecture.
but again it's only fair--as we judge him in terms of his architectural contribution,
I think it's only fair to remind ourselves that again he was only emperor for three years.
if he had been emperor longer, perhaps his contribution would have been greater.
he did finish several buildings, begun by Tiberius
and we're going to see this as a pattern, that is, emperors coming to the fore and completing buildings by their predecessors.
and he did build a couple of new things, including two new aqueducts and a circus located near what is now Vatican City.
he thought the Domus Tiberiana was a terrific idea and consequently he added to that palace;
that's the palace that Tiberius began on the slopes of the Palatine Hill.
but his main interest was villas outside Rome.
he built a number of those.
I'm not talking about Capri now, those were already built, and he could go down and enjoy those as emperor of Rome, but he wanted to ring Rome with a series of villas, and he began that work.
and later on, according to Pliny the Elder,
Rome was ringed with the villas, not only of Caligula, but also of Nero.
so these were going up apace around the city of Rome itself.
the single most important contribution though that Caligula made, and it is very significant, is to alter-- it was during his reign, during his brief reign, that the recipe for Roman concrete construction was altered.
what they did was make the decision to lighten it up, and they did that by taking the stone rubble that had been used in the mixture of concrete for some time, taking that stone rubble and dispensing with it, getting rid of it, because it was too heavy, and mixed the liquid mortar instead with a very porous, yellow tufa, and also with pumice, which is a soft light stone resembling cork.
so when you think of replacing heavy rubble with something that resembles cork, you get the sense that that is going to lead to lighter domes;
lighter domes are going to lead to domes that are able to span greater spaces.
so this is no small accomplishment. This is very, very significant.
it happens during the reign of Caligula, and we'll see already today that the so-called Golden House or Domus Aurea of Nero, would not have been possible, the span of that dome would not have been possible without this change in the recipe in concrete that happened under Caligula.
the other development under Caligula that I want to make reference to really has more to do with religious practice, but it also has an important impact on architecture, and that is the impact of mystery cults on Roman religion.
I think I've mentioned to you already that the Romans practiced a state religion, and that state religion was considered the religion that everyone should adhere to.
but over time, because of Rome's connections to other parts of the empire, especially the Eastern Empire, a whole host of different kinds of religions, mystery religions, exotic religions, began to infiltrate Rome.
they came back through the army, they came back through commerce, to Rome.
and initially they were not accepted.
you were not allowed to practice these openly.
and so we saw an example with the Villa of the Mysteries where the woman of the house created a special room, room number five, for the celebration of the cult of Dionysus, because that was considered a secret religion at that particular point.
but these mystery religions, Caligula himself showed some interest in them, and it began to look as if perhaps they would be able to begin to come up from underground.
they didn't during his reign, but I think again his contribution in that way was also an important one.
they did continue to have to meet in secret.
and one sect in particular I want to make reference to today, the so-called Neo-Pythagorean sect, because we'll see in the next monument that I want to show you, that it was that sect that was celebrated in a very interesting underground basilica that I want to turn to now.
it doesn't date to the time of Caligula;
in fact, it's a little bit later, in the reign of Claudius.
but I want to show it to you here, because again it was Caligula's beginning to be more accepting of these kinds of things that led in part to their proliferation, initially underground and then above ground as well.
this is the so-called Underground Basilica, because it is located underground.
it dates to around A. D. 50.
and you can see from this site plan its location.
you can see it marked "basilica" up there, and you can see that it's near a street we've already talked about, the Via Praenestina in Rome, which you'll remember is one, along with the Via Labicana, that came and converged on the Tomb of the Baker that we looked at last time.
in fact, if you look at this site plan, you see the trapezoidal plan of the Tomb of the Baker right here.
and when we discussed the Tomb of the Baker,
I made the point to you that it was located, or it was sited, in front of a great gate, the so-called Porta Maggiore, or the great gate that spanned two aqueducts.
and I said to you, I urged you to think away that great gate because it was built later.
it was built, in fact, during the reign of Claudius.
we're going to look at it momentarily.
so you see the great gate here, and you see the Tomb of the Baker, and that gives you a sense of the location of the basilica, the Underground Basilica of 50 A. D.
if you look at that basilica, you see the plan is exactly like the basilica in a civic context
the basilica at Pompeii, for example--with a central nave and two side aisles, divided by that nave, that central space, through architectural members, in this case through piers rather than columns;
and then at the end, to give some emphasis to one short side of the space, an apse, that you also see there.
this underground basilica was used for religious worship.
so we see once again what I've referred to as the interchangeability of form:
the idea of creating a certain building plan for a civic center, the law court or basilica, and then using it in other ways.
we already saw the basilican plan being used in house design at Herculaneum as a banqueting hall, and here we see it as a religious, a place for religious worship underground:
a basilican form being used for religious worship underground.
the Underground Basilica is miraculously preserved. Why?
because it's underground and it didn't--it consequently was kept in very good shape over time.
it's very difficult to get permission to go down and see it, but it is a marvel, as you can see from this image here.
how did they create this Underground Basilica?
how did they make this building underground?
well they cut trenches in the tufa rock, in the tufa rock;
remember we've talked about how ubiquitous tufa rock was in Rome, both on the hillsides, like the Palatine, and elsewhere.
so they cut trenches in the tufa rock, and then they poured concrete into those trenches to create the walls and also the barrel vault that you see so well here.
and once that concrete had dried, they cut it out in such a way as to create the piers that you also see very well in this structure.
so we're looking at that central space;
we're looking at the piers, the arches above those piers, and then that's supporting a barrel vaulting ceiling, as well as a semi-vault in the apse of this structure.
another view gives you a sense of the relationship of the central space to the aisles.
it's a fairly small structure but nonetheless it is quite light and airy, as I think you can see here, as we look from the central nave toward one of the side aisles.
you can see the piers and the arches above those piers, and you can also see the way in which the walls are decorated.
they're made out of concrete but they're stuccoed over and divided into a series of panels that are decorated with pretty strong resemblance to Third Style, and that resemblance becomes even clearer as we look up to the vault above.
this is how we surmise that this building was put up to the Neo-Pythagorean cult, because of the figures that we see floating in the central panels here.
those who have a good understanding of the Neo-Pythagorean cult have suggested that these track extremely well the beliefs of this particular cult.
but interesting for us is again the close resemblance of this to Third Style Roman wall painting.
it's done in stucco.
the stucco is painted, but you can see it's divided into a series of panels with floating mythological figures, or floating religious figures in this case, inside the panels.
and look then very carefully at some of the floral decorations, which you will see also resemble very closely the flimsy candelabra and so on that are characteristic of Third Style Roman painting.
this shouldn't surprise you. The date of 50 A. D. is still well within the Third Style.
we've talked about the very long life of the Third Style, that it was used already in the late first century B. C. but that it didn't really go out until about 62 A. D.
so 50 was still in that period of the Third Style;
it doesn't surprise us to see decoration like this, in this very interesting Underground Basilica.
Caligula was murdered in 41, and his wife and daughter--he had one daughter--were also murdered at the same time.
he had no family member to succeed him, and his uncle Claudius was chosen as the next emperor of Rome.
many of you may know the interesting story, quite captivating story, of how Claudius was chosen as emperor.
he was someone who was not highly respected by his family--and I'll say more about that in a moment;
no one ever thought he was going to amount to anything.
and when, after Caligula's death, Claudius was such, kind of timid, that he hid behind a curtain.
but as the Praetorian Guard wandered through the palace, trying to figure out who in the world they were going to appoint as Caligula's successor, they saw a pair of feet underneath a curtain.
they pulled open that curtain and they saw Claudius, and they thought, "Well he's going to be no trouble at all.
no one thinks much of him.
we're going to be able to get everything we want if we appoint Claudius as emperor.
and so they did, they bowed down, and they said, "You are now--," or they put him up on their shoulders,"You are now emperor of Rome.
well Claudius surprised them because he was a very smart individual indeed, as we shall see.
this is a cameo, a famous cameo that represents Claudius, just for you to get some sense of what he looked like, over here on the left, with his wife, and then possibly--these two figures over here are controversial
possibly with Tiberius or some other member of the imperial family.
this is blown up into colossal size.
it's a fairly small but very beautiful cameo, and these cameos were used as presentation pieces in ancient Roman times.
Claudius was emperor of Rome between A. D. 41 and 54.
I mentioned that his family did not have much respect for him.
they thought he was weak and sickly, and they thought he was dim-witted.
and the only reason they thought he was dim-witted, because the poor fellow stammered, and they thought that that reflected an undisciplined mind.
not at all, he was very, very intelligent indeed, and he surprised them.
he surprised not only the Praetorian Guard but also his family, when he became emperor.
he turned out to be a unique individual with a predilection, as we shall see, for an entirely new kind of, and very distinctive form of architecture, and one that I believe--and I'll try to make the case to you today-- reflected his very distinctive intellect.
we need to know therefore something about him and how he came
how he had trained himself intellectually before he became emperor of Rome.
he was fifty-years-old when he became emperor.
he had been, in the years prior to that, a scholar, an historian, an antiquarian, a linguist.
he wrote a history of Rome by himself--it was not ghostwritten--and he wrote several volumes, also on his own, on the Etruscans; he was particularly interested in the Etruscans.
we know he added a few letters to the Latin alphabet to give it more range, and he was the last Roman, as far as we know, to be able to read and also write Etruscan.
this gives you a very good sense of the man.
with regard to architecture, he rejected categorically the interests of Tiberius and Caligula in villa architecture, and he returned to the construction of public architecture
he looked to Augustus as a model for this-- and especially to public works.
let me show you one example.
you see on the screen a site plan of the port of Rome.
I've already mentioned the fact that the port of Rome was located at Ostia,
ostia the city at the mouth of the Tiber River.
we saw the plan of Ostia, a colony already founded in the mid-fourth century B. C. in around 350, and it grew over time and it had its efflorescence, as we'll see in a later lecture, in the second century A. D.
here the plan of Ostia over here.
the Tiber River, and then at the mouth of the Tiber River, at a place that we call Portus, a location that we call Portus or Porto-- it's on the Monument List for you--the actual harbor itself.
what we're looking at above is a coin of the emperor Nero.
you see Nero on the obverse and on the reverse a representation of what we think is the port built by Claudius.
we have a description of the port of Claudius by Suetonius in his Lives.
Suetonius tells us that the port had curving breakwaters, curving breakwaters.
and if we look at this coin of Nero that was struck by the emperor between 64 and 68 A. D. we see on the back what is clearly a port, with curving breakwaters.
so we believe that this must be a depiction of the port built by Claudius sometime during his reign, that is, between 41 and 54.
what does that coin tell us about what that port must have looked like?
we can see that there is a large statue in the upper center.
there is a river god reclining below, probably the Tiber himself, to locate this port, and also a series of boats in the center.
but most important again are the curving breakwaters, which you can see are made up of a series of columns;
they look like colonnades, one on either side, curving colonnades.
this plan down here shows us the likely plan of the Claudian harbor, roughly circular, again with breakwaters on either side, with columns on either side.
this area was added to by the emperor Trajan, in the early second century A. D.
he added a five-sided port as well, and you can see that here, in this plan as well.
but think that away for now.
all that would've been there was Claudius' port with the curving breakwaters.
this is a painting of both of those ports, that's on the wall in the Vatican.
I've walked by it many times and only recently really noticed it and took a picture of it, and I think it'll be helpful to you today because it gives you a sense of what this port looked like in antiquity.
we see the later port of Trajan over here.
but again think that away for now and concentrate on the curving breakwaters of Claudius' port.
you see here this colossal statue, possibly of Neptune, over here, a lighthouse, over here, and the boats in the center of this.
but most important for us again are those curving breakwaters and the fact that they were made up of columns.
the columns are all that survive today, and what a set of columns they are.
I show a detail of some of them to you here.
and you should be struck by these columns, because these are columns unlike any other columns that we have seen in the course of this semester.
if you look at these columns very carefully, you will see that the capitals on the top, which are very severe--they're not exactly the Doric order but they resemble the Doric order-- very severe, and they are finished; you can identify them as capitals.
and the bases, I'll show you a view of the bases in a moment, the bases, as we'll also see, are also finished with very nice moldings down below.
but in between the bases and the capitals, we see something again that we've never seen before, and that is a series of drums, of column drums, piled one on top of another.
but those drums are not finished, or they're left in a rough state -- one or the other.
they have either been deliberately left in a rough or rusticated state, or they were unfinished.
why might they have been unfinished?
they might have been unfinished because the project was late, they were rushing it, they wanted to get it done, they needed to use the harbor, and so they said, "Look, to save time just put those columns up the way they are and don't bother finishing the drums of the column.
or one could argue that it might have had to do with expense, that it was getting too expensive, and that they decided not to finish the drums for that reason.
or it might have been deliberate, or it might have been deliberate:
the idea to leave those drums rough, to make them look rusticated.
I'm going to make a case today that it's the last, that this was a deliberate move on Claudius and his architects.
and one of the main reasons I can make that
if this is all we had, if we had only this port of Claudius, only these columns in this style, it would be very difficult to make the case.
but as we're going to see, when we move from this to that great gate, or the Porta Maggiore, which was put up under Claudius, and then not today but next time, to a building that was put up in Claudius' honor after his death, we will see that all three of those have these rusticated columns or piers in common, which suggests to us
it suggests to me for sure-- that these are--that leaving was deliberate on the part of the patron and his architects.
and I'm also going to suggest that it had to do with Claudius'peculiar personality, and especially his interest in antiquarianism, in the past, in the history of Rome, and the history of the Etruscans, and so on.
here's another detail of one of the columns over here, where you can see the rough drum, and then down below the base on which that sits, a molded base, very carefully molded.
the architects, the designers, the artisans could finish these columns perfectly well if they chose to.
they did it on the base, they did it in the capitals, but not in between.
here's another one where you can see a series of columns engaged into a wall, and again you can see the rough or rusticated drums.
then down below the molded and finished bases.
so this difference between what we call finished masonry or dressed-- d-r-e-s-s-e-d--dressed masonry, or rusticated masonry: masonry that is deliberately left rough.
again, in order to underscore this point,
I want to turn now to the great gate or the Porta Maggiore in Rome, also built by Claudius between 41 and 54 A. D.
you already know its location, near the Tomb of Eurysaces, near the Underground Basilica that we also discussed today.
and I had mentioned to you already that the purpose of this gate was to serve as a crossing point for two aqueducts:
aqueducts that had been begun earlier, were worked on by Caligula, and then completed by Claudius.
and there were two of them that crossed at this very point, and they needed something to mask that crossing, and so they built this great gate, the Porta Maggiore.
if you look at this general view of the Porta Maggiore, you will see much of what I have already described.
it has two open archways.
the uppermost part, which is the attic, which has an inscription--it's a three-tiered attic, as you can see, and if you look carefully you will see it has an extensive inscription, making reference to Claudius and to the aqueducts and so on.
down below we see a series of smaller arcuations, surrounded by columns on either side, supporting pediments above.
if you look closely you can see that the pediments are finished, the pediments are finished, the lintels are finished, the capitals are finished, but the blocks of the column and the blocks of the rest of the structure are left in a rusticated state.
they are not finished, and we see that very stark difference between the rusticated masonry and the finished masonry:
the smooth masonry, the dressed masonry and the rough masonry in this structure.
this gate, by the way, is made out of travertine travertine cut stone construction.
here's another view that I think shows you better the way in which this gate masks the crossing of those two aqueducts.
you can see two channels there, and one would have had pipes running through it one way and the other would have had pipes running through it the other way, and that's how they crossed in antiquity.
and I'll show you a model that may make that even clearer in a moment.
you can also see the location of the Tomb of the baker Eurysaces right next to the so-called Porta Maggiore.
here's the model that I showed you when we looked at the Tomb of Eurysaces, the way in which the Praenestina and the Labicana come into Rome and converge at the facade of that tomb.
here you see the great gate or Porta Maggiore behind it.
and this is the best illustration I can give of the way in which those two, the pipes of the two aqueducts, cross behind the attic of the gate, which is one of the reasons it had to be as tall as it did, and one of the reasons it had to have tiers was in order-- because it was separated behind.
you can see that very well here, as well as the rusticated, the contrast between the rusticated masonry and the finished masonry of this great gate.
this combination of the two is a very mannered thing to do, and it's interesting that later Renaissance architects in Italy
and for those of you who are aficionados of the Renaissance, you may know the work of an architect by the name of Giulio Romano who created the famous Palazzo del Te in Mantua.
and I show you a detail of the Palazzo del Te, just to make the point, the more general point-- you don't have to worry about Giulio
but just to make the general point that these Renaissance architects, like Giulio Romano, looked back to buildings like the Porta Maggiore in Rome when they also conceived of buildings in which they contrasted rusticated masonry with smooth masonry, as you can also see so well.
and here are two last details of the Porta Maggiore, and I think these show you, almost more than anything else I have thus far, this incredible contrast between the finished and the unfinished masonry, between the smooth and the rough.
and here you see, you can see a detail of the pediment, of the smoothness of that;
of the lintel down below; of the capital, which is completely finished; and then even of the uppermost part of the column.
and this is a particularly interesting detail, I think, because it gives me the sense, as I look at it, that what the patron and architects are trying to do is give us a sense that the column actually lives inside the rusticated drums.
I get the sense as I look at this that this finished column is just
is very anxious to bust out of the rusticated masonry in which it is confined;
it's very anxious to emerge from that rusticated masonry.
and I can't help but think of the Renaissance again, and especially of Michelangelo.
for any of who've seen his slaves in the Accademia in Florence, the slaves that seem to
he took these big blocks of Carrara marble, and he represents the slaves as if they are still immersed in that marble, but trying to break free from that marble, as if these images of human beings were somehow located inside that marble and just waiting for the genius Michelangelo to free them from that marble.
it's the same sense that I get here when I look at this, and it makes me think again that a very intelligent, a very refined mind is behind sorting out this kind of thing, and conceiving of something of this nature.
and given the education and the bent of Claudius, he is just the kind of man who might have done that.
and I think we need to see the architecture of Claudius, this rusticated architecture of Claudius, which is contrasted to the smooth and finished architecture, at the same time, as something that really is reflective of the peculiar personality of this man.
I think it's also important to say though that this kind of architecture, at this time, is very old-fashioned.
the whole idea of using cut stone travertine construction, after what we've seen is going on in concrete construction, is a very old-fashioned thing to do, and again shows us a man who is looking to the past, who's looking to the history of Rome, to the history of the Etruscans, perhaps rather than to the present.
but, on the positive side, one could also say that what he is doing here, he is using stone construction, but he is using it in a very different way, and indeed an almost anti-classical way, to the way in which Augustus used it.
think of Augustus' Ara Pacis.
think of Augustus' Temple of Mars Ultor in the Forum of Augustus in Rome.
both of those marble buildings, in that case Luna or Carrara marble, based on ancient Greek prototypes.
this is also stone architecture, and in that sense again old-fashioned, but it's travertine, not marble.
but it is anti-classical in its use of this rusticated, as well as smooth masonry.
so I do want you to ponder this architecture of Claudius and think for yourselves about whether you think again it is due, the form that it takes is due to the very interesting and unusual personality of this one man.
from Claudius, I want to turn to the notorious Nero, and his amazing architectural legacy.
and you see a portrait of Nero here, on the right-hand side of the screen, and a coin with his mother on the left.
the mother of Nero was Agrippina the Younger.
Agrippina the Younger was the last wife of Claudius, and it was rumored that Agrippina the Younger murdered Claudius with a bowl of poisoned mushrooms.
we don't know if that's true or not, it may be just rumor mongering.
but it's perfectly conceivable because she certainly had a motive, and that is she thought she would have more power if her teenage son
because he was only about 17-years-old at the time-- was on the throne of Rome, instead of her older husband.
and this coin that you see on the left-hand side of the screen, of the young Nero and Agrippina I think says it all;
I mean, mother and son almost nose to nose.
this gives real meaning to being 'in your face';
as you can see here, Agrippina is certainly in the face of Nero on this coin.
and she was with regard to his life, dominating him in the very early years of his reign.
Nero was born in A. D. 37. He was emperor between 54 and 68.
at his death, his murder--he was forced to commit suicide actually in 68
he suffered a damnatio memoriae, which was a condemnation by the Senate of him, a damnation of his memory;
and an attempt to destroy his portraits, and also his architectural monuments, followed that damnatio memoriae. Nero was the last of the Julio-Claudian emperors.
he was the adoptive son of Claudius, and as I've already mentioned the real son of Claudius' last wife, Agrippina the Elder .
I mentioned already that Agrippina--or I gave you the sense
that Agrippina was a quite aggressive woman who aggravated Claudius and Nero both.
we talked about the poisoned mushroom stories, and the fact that when her son became emperor, she received, at least for a while, enhanced power in Rome.
but Nero eventually paid his mother back by having her murdered in A. D. 59.
he also got rid of his wife Octavia, a beautiful young girl whom he had murdered in 62.
so by the age of 25, Nero had gotten rid of the women, the two women, who had dominated his youth, and his much-touted madness
he was not unlike Caligula in some of the wild things that he did-- his much-touted madness began to appear.
that said, despite his madness, he was absolutely adored by the populace.
it was a great show to watch Nero, and people liked seeing what he would do next.
he was adored by the populace.
he was however hated by the aristocracy and in 68, he was hunted down by his enemies and he was forced to commit suicide.
I would call Nero a patron of architecture extraordinaire.
his contribution to the development of Roman architecture is indeed extraordinary.
he had a passion for the arts, which undoubtedly led to his devotion to building.
he wrote and he sang poems. Nero was a musician. He collected Greek works of art.
he traveled to Greece to participate in the Olympics.
whenever he did that, they were always fixed in his favor.
when he traveled around Greece and Asia Minor, he stole--if he saw a work of art he liked, he stole it, and he brought it back to Rome to display.
he interwove his life with his art, in the same manner as Claudius did.
he took advantage of that very famous fire in Rome, which took place in 64 A. D. to legend has it that he fiddled while Rome burned.
he wasn't fiddling actually but he was participating in some sort of musical performance; we know that.
and after the fire raged through the city and caused incredible havoc and great destruction, what Nero did was instead of rebuilding the land for the people of Rome, he just expropriated 300 to 350 acres of prime real estate in downtown Rome, and he used it to build his own villa, his own palace, in the center of Rome, the famous Domus Aurea or Golden House, because it had a gilded facade.
Nero's architecture was intimately bound up with the vicissitudes of his life and his distinctive, if not warped, personality, as we shall see.
Nero built two palaces in Rome, and I'd like to begin with the one--I'd like to deal with those in consecutive order.
the first of these, as you can see from the Monument List, is the so-called Domus Transitoria
the less well-known one and less well-preserved one
the Domus Transitoria in Rome that was built sometime before the fire, before A. D.64, because it was very significantly destroyed in that fire of A. D. 64.
I'm showing you a Google Earth image of the part of Rome in which this building found itself.
we are looking down--we've seen this one before
we are looking down at the Roman Forum, the Colosseum in the uppermost part there, the Palatine Hill over here.
and if we follow the Roman Forum toward the Colosseum and toward the later Arch of Constantine, we will see that there is a spur hill over, and that spur hill is located between the Palatine Hill and one of Rome's other hills, the Esquiline--E-s-q -u-i-l-i-n-e--the Esquiline Hill.
Nero's dream was to link the buildings that were going up on the Palatine.
we've already talked about the Imperial Palace, begun by Tiberius, continued by Caligula.
Claudius had no interest in that.
but then Nero returns to it, and he's continuing to build this palace on the Palatine.
but his dream is to link that with property that he also owns on the Esquiline Hill, and to make one truly grandiose palace that links those two hills, across a spur hill called the Velia,
V-e-l-i-a, which is in this uppermost part of the Roman Forum, closest to the Colosseum.
that was his dream, and he began to try to realize it prior to 64 A. D.
the building is called the Domus Transitoria because it served as a point of transit between those two hills, between the Palatine and the Esquiline Hills.
again, because it was so seriously destroyed in fire, and also because it was deliberately destroyed by later emperors who were following the damnation, the damnatio memoriae, the damnation of Nero's memory, and felt that it was their right, in a sense, to destroy his buildings.
so those two things together, deliberate destruction plus the fire, essentially destroyed most of the Domus Transitoria.
but a couple of sections are preserved underground, and they're very important for us to look at because they give us insight into the later Golden House or Domus Aurea.
I want to show you the two sections that are still preserved in restored views that you will find in your textbook, in Ward-Perkins.
one of these is located beneath the-- while this is still on the screen, if you look at the Palatine Palace here, just a little bit up beyond where my finger is, there is the dining hall of the later first century A. D.
palace that we'll look at soon, next week. You see it there.
and one of the buildings, a fountain of Nero's Domus Transitoria, is located under that.
and then over here, this temple that you see right close to the Colosseum, is a later Hadrianic Temple of Venus and Roma.
the domed room that I'm going to show you, is under that.
so both of these are underground, beneath later structures.
this is a restored view from Ward-Perkins of the fountain, the fountain court of Nero's Domus Transitoria, and we see a number of important features.
we see an open court with a pool, with columns around it.
on the northern wall over here, we see the fountain itself.
we see that what the architects have done is create, using a niche, a place in that niche, a series of other niches, that served as the location of the actual water from which the fountain emerged, and the water would cascade over this wall down here, and then end up in a long basin in front of it.
the wall is what's most interesting.
if you look at it, you will see that it is essentially scalloped, with columns in the front and then additional columns in the receding bays, creating a kind of in-and-out effect, very similar to theater architecture, and I show you a restored view of a typical theater, of earlier date, just to give you a sense of what this is based on.
you can also see that opening up off this central court, screened by columns, are barrel-vaulted rooms on either side.
these were used as special dining areas;
so special dining areas with beautiful views out onto this fountain court on either side.
and then this restored view also gives you a sense that the pavements were variegated, were done in different designs.
and we know that these pavements were made out of marble and that the walls were revetted with marble.
this isn't the faux marble of the First Style, this is real marble, and it's our first example in Rome of a room that was revetted with marble, brought from all parts of the world: marble brought from Africa, marble brought from Egypt, marble brought from Asia Minor and also from Greece, in various colors, to decorate the fountain court of Nero's Domus Transitoria.
the other room, and perhaps the more important of the two, is the domed room
definitely more important of the two-- the domed room in the Domus Transitoria of Nero.
and you see a restored view of it here. What are we dealing with?
we are dealing with a structure that is clearly based on the thermal bath at Baia and the frigidaria of Pompeii.
it is a concrete structure. It looks as if it's round.
in fact, you can see a circle inscribed in the pavement, down here below.
the structure is made out of concrete. It has a dome and an oculus.
but even though it is inscribed in a circle, if you look carefully at the walls, you will see that although they are curved
they follow the curvature of the circle-- there are eight sides to this wall.
so the architect is starting to explore the idea of an octagon.
this is not an octagon--it's a circle inscribed in an octagon, in a sense--but it is an exploration into an eight-sided form, that we're going to see is very, very important for a later development in the Golden House of Nero.
also what we see here that's very interesting, that's a further development of the frigidarium and thermal bath idea, is instead of this circular structure and an octagon ending with these radiating apses, the four radiating apses that we saw at Baia, for example, we see that they extend into corridors on either side, which expands the space in a way that we have not seen before.
you see, they don't end on either side with these apses with walls, they expand into these long corridors, as you can see, creating a kind of cross shape, and certainly adding to the interesting spatial relationships and spatial possibilities, and the use again of vista and panorama, as we've seen.
we see here also, on either side here, a series of columns with metal grills on top:
so wonderful views through those columns to what lies beyond.
and then on this side, a small pool that had white marble and then colored marbles around that.
so you have to imagine again the overall appearance of this in antiquity, when light would have streamed through the dome of the central space, onto the walls that probably had mosaic on them, through the grills and the columns, onto the water of the white pool here, which was also surrounded with variegated marbles
these same marbles brought from all over the world.
the view must have been quite spectacular.
this is certainly again a form of ostentatious palatial architecture that Augustus eschewed, but was becoming of increasing interest to the likes of Tiberius, Caligula, and ultimately Nero.
and again, just to make the same point again, we can trace this back to the experiments of the frigidaria at Pompeii:
that's the Stabian Baths too, the thermal bath, the Temple of Mercury at Baia.
but look at the difference that it makes when you extend those apses into corridors, creating a much freer spatial situation and adding to the vista and panorama idea that has been so popular, as we've long seen, with the Romans.
in the time that remains, I want to turn to Nero's most important architectural commission, and I can't over-emphasize the significance of this structure that I'm going to show you now, the so-called Domus Aurea or the Golden House of Nero, again because of its gilded facade.
we've already talked about the fire that raged through Rome in 64, and that when that fire, when the smoke from that fire died down, that Nero expropriated 300 to 350 acres in prime downtown Rome, for his own use, for a private palace, the so-called Golden House.
we see a site plan here, also from Ward-Perkins, where you can get a sense, not only of the extent of this
look how it covers ground from the Circus Maximus, all the way across, to the Esquiline Hill, as you can see so well here.
so the Palatine Hill, the Esquiline Hill, and also even the Caelian Hill over here.
he dug an artificial -- or he had his architects dig an artificial lake in the center of this, as you can see here.
and the Golden House was very extensive.
there's only one part of it that remains today, under the--or as part of the Esquiline Hill in Rome, and we therefore call it the Esquiline Wing of the Domus Aurea of Nero.
this palace had an incredible set of gimmicks, gimmicks that were so noteworthy that the names of the architects have come down to us, the architect and engineer who are responsible for this.
and I think it is largely they came down to us largely because of these incredible gimmicks that they created for this structure.
their names were Severus and Celer; Severus and Celer.
and I believe I have put their names on the Monument List for you.
yes I have, underneath the plan of the Esquiline Wing.
so Severus and Celer; their names suggest to us that they were Roman architects, in fact.
and these gimmicks included a 125-foot statue of Nero himself, a colossal stature--or the Colossus, as it is designated here--a colossal statue of Nero assimilated to the sun god Sol, S-o-l, the sun god Sol, and it was done in bronze and it was done by a famous artist, whose name we also know, Zenodorus
I've also put his name on the Monument List for you
zenodorus, who was a very famous bronze caster.
so Zenodorus' Colossus, the gilded facade.
and what were some of the gimmicks that Severus and Celer added to this palace?
when you ate in the dining hall, if you were invited as a special guest to eat with Nero, while you were eating the coffered ceilings of one of the dining rooms would drop on you all kinds of wonderful fragrances and flower petals, while you ate.
there was also a bath that gave you a choice of sea water and salt water and water from the sulfur springs of Tivoli;
you had your choice, if you were bathing at Nero's Domus Aurea.
and most spectacularly of all, and I think what Severus and Celer had particular fame for, was they created a banqueting room that had a revolving ceiling, supposedly, a ceiling that revolved with the heavenly bodies.
so an incredible array of gimmicks, as I said before, in this extraordinary palace, but all of them clearly possible Vis-à-vis architecture at this time.
I'm showing you here a plan of the Esquiline Wing.
this is the one part of the palace that survives today.
we'll talk about what happened to this palace in a later lecture, but you can see it here.
dozens and dozens of rooms around a five-sided court, as you can see at this location.
and then here, what is the so-called octagonal room of Nero's Domus Aurea, which is a remarkable room.
and I think it's fair to say the single most important room that I will have shown you thus far this semester is the octagonal room of Nero's Domus Aurea.
and you see it here.
you can see the plan of the octagon, and then the radiating spaces out from it.
I'll return to that plan in just a moment.
just to mention though, by using Google Earth again,
I can show you the particular location of the Esquiline Wing on the Esquiline Hill today.
what happened to it eventually--and again I'm not going to go into the details now but I will in the future-- after Nero's damnatio memoriae, some of this was destroyed and much of it was incorporated into later buildings.
eventually a bath of the emperor Trajan ended up on this site, and the emperor covered over what remained of Nero's Domus Aurea, what hadn't been razed to the ground, and incorporated some of it into his later bath.
and, in fact, this hemicycle of Trajan's Baths is actually the entranceway today of the Domus Aurea.
you can see it right here, and you can see that the other remains of both Trajan's Baths and of the Domus Aurea have been incorporated into a modern garden, a very attractive garden where you can wander and see some of the remains of both.
and actually what you see here--it just shows how amazing Google Earth is
this circle that you see here is actually-- it has a grate on top today
but it is actually the oculus of Nero's octagonal room, which is down below, which is located underground.
so if you visit the Domus Aurea, which is, as you can see, right near the Colosseum, you go into the entranceway through the hemicycle of Trajan's later baths, and you find yourself in a series of corridors.
we've talked about these corridors before, because we talked about the paintings that Fabullus did, for Nero's Domus Aurea; first the Third Style paintings and then the Fourth Style paintings.
and you'll remember that the Domus Aurea was described as Fabullus' prison, because there were so many rooms and corridors that it would take a whole lifetime to paint them.
and you see some of those here: barrel vaulted corridors, stuccoed over, and then painted in the Third and Fourth styles.
another gimmick that you see throughout the Domus Aurea are a series of bridges that are built to carry water from one part of the palace to another.
another view here showing one of the corridors, and what you see here is something that we have not discussed yet, but is the wave of the future, and that is concrete faced with brick.
after the fire there was realization-- the fire of 64--there was realization that stone burned too easily, it was not an effective facing any longer, and that they needed to come up with something else.
brick worked better with fire.
so the decision was taken to move--and this is not the tile brick in Pompeii, this is real brick--and the decision was taken to begin to use brick-faced construction for these buildings.
at this time it was stuccoed over, as you can see here: stucco, and then painted on top.
so you wouldn't have actually seen the brick in antiquity, but we'll see it was not long until the Romans recognized that brick was a very attractive material in its own right, and began to leave it exposed.
but we're not there yet.
the paintings, the Fourth Style paintings of Fabullus.
you'll remember this one that we've already looked at, with the reintroduction of architectural fragments and the architectural cages in the Domus Aurea.
this is the single--as I've already said-- the single most remarkable and important room that I've shown you thus far this semester, the octagonal room in Nero's Domus Aurea.
you see this cross-section plan, an axonometric view from Ward-Perkins here.
and you can get a very good sense of this.
this is truly an octagonal room.
the experiment in the domed room, where they had inscribed a circle into an octagon, gave them the idea that they were going to try to make an actual octagonal room out of concrete, and they succeed here.
you can see the eight sides of this room.
you can see it has a series of radiating alcoves, but much bigger alcoves than we saw in the frigidaria at Pompeii, or in the thermal bath at Baia, and differently shaped ones-- not all the same, but a couple are cross-shaped and others are rectangular-- different shapes.
and then the axonometric view shows you that within those alcoves there are additional niches in some of the walls that give more of a sculptural quality to this than has been the case before.
and this again was no small feat on the part of these architects.
why is the Domus Aurea so important-- excuse me--the octagonal room of the Domus Aurea so important?
the octagonal room of the Domus Aurea
and I've given you a number of bullet points here
represents a break from the tyranny of the rectangle, the tyranny of the rectangle that we know from Greek and Etruscan architecture.
it enables vistas to be created in every direction, and you know the importance to Romans of vistas and panoramas.
it creates one continuous envelope around an interior space.
it fully realizes--this development has been long in coming but we're finally there
it fully realizes the technical and expressive potentiality of Roman concrete construction.
it represents a switch of emphasis from solids to voids
from walls and roofs that we saw in such buildings as the Temple of Portunus, to the insubstantial space that they enclose and shape.
it is the interior space, not the walls that matter now.
and in this new interior architecture, light plays a key role:
natural light that creates drama, as well as illuminates.
the importance of the octagonal room of Nero's Domus Aurea cannot be overstated
the octagonal room heralds the Roman architectural revolution that we saw already beginning at places like Palestrina, but it is finally here, in its full-blown form;
whereas I said the potentiality of the expressiveness of Roman concrete is fully realized.
this is the room itself, as it looks today.
we can see the octagon, we can see the dome.
we can see the way in which the octagon becomes the dome, the eight sides and the way it is shaped to become the dome above.
we can see some of the niches here.
we can see the way in which the spaces expand from the central space, and we can see niches within those, to give a greater sculptural quality to it.
and you can get a little bit of the sense of the light here.
this would have been elaborately decorated in antiquity.
I show you a restored view.
all of those same marbles, from Egypt, from Africa, from Asia Minor, from Greece, all brought together here; lots of different colors.
this is what those Pompeians wished their walls actually looked like.
but you see real marble revetted walls, marble pavements, and then up above
in all kinds of colors -- and then up above the ceiling stuccoed over and also painted.
one can only imagine Nero entering into this octagonal room, and how he must have felt.
and, in fact, we have a quote from Nero, in which he says that when the Domus Aurea in Rome was finished-- or he's reported to have said, when the Domus Aurea in Rome was finished-- he's reported to have said, and I quote:
at last, at last, I am going to be able to be housed like a human being.
that was the way Nero thought about this.
he achieved his goal, undoubtedly, at least for a short period of time before he died in 68.
and I believe--and I'm sure you agree with me
I believe that it is for the Domus Aurea, especially for the octagonal room of the Domus Aurea, that Nero would have liked to be remembered, and indeed he achieved his goal.
thank you.
good morning all.
these were gargantuan buildings, bigger than anything that we have seen before, and interesting in all kinds of ways.
we left off with Nerva, with the emperor Nerva.
and you'll recall that Nerva was old, and in fact also relatively sickly, when he became emperor of Rome.
you'll also remember--and I remind you of his portrait on the left-hand side of the screen
you'll also recall that he was a member of the Senate, and that he was chosen by the Senate, one of their own, to become emperor of Rome, the first emperor to come from the senatorial ranks in the history of Rome, and he was very popular with the Senate.
but Nerva recognized quite early on that, although he was popular with the Senate and with the aristocracy, he was not a favorite of the army, and he realized that was not a good position to be in, and so he wisely decided, very early on, that he would select the most popular military man and the most highly successful military man in Rome, a man by the name of Trajan, as his heir.
and so Nerva adopts Trajan--and you see Trajan's portrait on the right-hand side of the screen
Nerva adopts Trajan in 97 A. D.so that in 98, when Nerva dies because he dies after only sixteen months in office-- when Nerva dies, Trajan succeeds him without contest.
Trajan was an extraordinary emperor for Rome.
there are a number of important points about Trajan that should be made that have an impact on our understanding and analysis of his architecture.
one of those is he's the first Roman emperor to be born outside of Italy.
he was born in Spain, the first emperor born in Spain.
that's not to say that Spain was the boondocks, by any stretch of the imagination.
spain had already been colonized by Rome and was very highly developed with regard to its civilization.
he also came to power as a relatively young man.
he was only 45 years of age a couple of years younger than Obama and consequently he was in and he was in very good physical shape, and so he had the physical wherewithal to be the kind of energetic emperor that Rome needed at this particular point.
he undertook many military campaigns, and very successfully, and he was the emperor that extended Rome to its furthest reaches, to its greatest borders, to its most extensive borders, during his reign.
and actually these were borders that were never gone beyond.
after this point, we'll see that the emperor Hadrian consolidates the extent of the Empire, as reached by Trajan, and no one ever takes it beyond that.
so this is going to be the furthest extent of the Empire that we'll see in the course of the semester.
and he was also extremely wise when it came to his choice of the kinds of buildings that he wanted to put up, because he followed in the footsteps of Vespasian and Titus, by favoring major public architecture in Rome, and by eschewing private architecture.
he wanted, above all, to disassociate himself from Nero, and from Domitian, who had favored palatial architecture, as you'll recall.
and so he builds public architecture in Rome, and allies himself in this regard to such earlier emperors as Augustus and as Claudius and as the Flavian dynasts, and we're going to see that in his building projects today.
like so many other emperors, when he first came to power, he looked around to see which buildings had fallen into disrepair, and he decided to restore as many of those as he could.
and he chose very carefully.
again, he obviously did not choose buildings of Nero, many of which had already been destroyed, in any case, but rather looked back further, in fact, dug deep into the Republic, a time, a simpler time in many respects, and a time prior to the shenanigans of the monarchically minded emperors like Nero and Domitian, and he restored buildings from the Republic and from the Augustan period.
and he looked back, for example, to the Forum of Caesar in Rome, the Forum Iulium, which you all know well, and we've talked about it before, and I'm not going to discuss it in any detail today.
just to remind you that it began to be restored-- that is, the Forum of Julius Caesar-- under Domitian, and that that restoration was completed by Trajan at some point during his reign, between 98 and 117 A. D.
and I remind you of that here.
you'll recall its location, right next to the Victor Emmanuel Monument in Rome.
you'll remember that even though it was restored by Domitian and Trajan, it has fallen on hard times.
and if you look at the Temple of Venus Genetrix, you see that all that survives, besides the podium and the staircase, are three columns from that restored version, by Trajan.
you see the same three columns over here, and then you'll recall the great open space, with colonnades on either side, and then the market area, the shops or tabernae on the left.
I showed you this view as well, pointing out one of the architectural blocks that belonged to the restored building, the building under Trajan.
and you can see that Trajan continues this interest in ornamentation that was characteristic of the Flavian period:
very ornamental architectural decoration, very deeply carved, with a strong contrast between light and dark.
so he does continue this Flavian interest in very elaborate architectural decoration.
you'll remember that the Temple of Venus Genetrix, in the Forum of Julius Caesar, had a pediment that had in the center of that pediment a scene depicting Venus rising from the sea.
and there is other Venus imagery, and I show you a detail-- and it's on your Monument List
I show you a detail of part of a frieze that depicts cupids-- chubby, winged babies, as you can see here, cupids
who are carrying the arms--you can see one of them with a sword sheath over here
they are carrying the arms and armor of Mars:
Mars, of course, the consort of Venus, and Mars making reference also to military victory.
this frieze, as far as we can tell, does belong to the Trajanic renovation of the building, but it probably does look back to an earlier Julian frieze that decorated the original temple in Rome.
and I use that restoration of the Temple of Venus Genetrix, in the Forum of Julius Caesar, as an example of the kind of restoration work that Trajan embarked on, at the beginning of his principate.
but much more important to us today are two buildings, the first a bath, and the second a forum, that are examples of the devotion that Trajan had to public architecture during his reign.
and I show you a view here, in fact, a plan of the so-called Baths of Trajan in Rome that were dedicated in A. D. 109.
as you can see from the Monument List, we know the architect in this particular case.
it is Apollodorus of Damascus.
and his name says a lot about him: Apollodorus from Damascus, modern Syria.
so it's very interesting.
we have an emperor from Spain and an architect from Syria, who worked together.
this is a sign that things are beginning to change in the Roman Empire, as the Romans--as Trajan extends those borders even further.
it brings in even more multifaceted civilizations around the world, and talent begins to pour into Rome from all of those places.
Apollodorus of Damascus, as we'll see today, was an extraordinary architect, right up there with Severus and Celer, and with Rabirius:
in fact, one could argue even the equal of Rabirius.
and what's particularly interesting is that Apollodorus of Damascus, like Severus and Celer before him, appears to have been, above all, a great engineer.
he actually accompanied Trajan on Trajan's military campaigns, and served as Trajan's military architect.
so his first commissions were building bridges-- I'm going to show you a reference to one today
building bridges, or building forts and camps on Trajan's military campaigns, and then using that expertise, ingratiating himself with the emperor, who sees that he is enormously talented
because Trajan participated in these campaigns himself seeing how talented he was, and then putting him in charge of his building projects in Rome, which is really quite interesting.
and so these projects are not only aesthetically pleasing and fascinating, but also show extraordinary engineering skill on the part of the major designer, namely Apollodorus of Damascus.
now these Baths of Trajan are very interesting in all kinds of ways.
you can already see, by looking at the plan, their location.
they are located on the Esquiline Hill and part of the Oppian Hill, which I don't think I've mentioned before--O-p-p-i-a-n, the smaller Oppian Hill.
and the Baths of Titus--well let me remind you first that the Domus Aurea of Nero was built, in part, on the Esquiline Hill.
and you'll recall the so-called Esquiline Wing, which is the one wing of Nero's Domus Aurea that is still preserved underground.
you'll recall that after Nero's damnatio memoriae, and the coming to power of the Flavian dynasty, that Vespasian and Titus, and even Domitian, razed to the ground Nero's buildings-- Vespasian did that
and then he and Titus and Domitian built new buildings, on top of those, and chose to make those buildings the kind of public buildings that the citizenry as a whole would enjoy;
from the Colosseum and amphitheater to the Baths of Titus.
and you see again the Baths of Titus here, located right again on top of this area that originally belonged to Nero's Domus Aurea.
Trajan follows suit.
he not only is interested in public architecture, like Vespasian and Titus before him, but he follows their lead in building these buildings on top of earlier structures, now destroyed, of Nero.
so it's again this same message, giving back to the people the land that Nero had taken illegally from Rome during his reign.
the Baths of Trajan are based, in large part, on the plan of the Baths of Titus, with some additions.
but you can see the extraordinary difference in scale.
the Baths of Titus were not small, and yet the Baths of Trajan are at least three, if not four or more, times the size of the Baths of Titus.
so this tells us something again about the grandiosity of the vision of Trajan, about the funds that he had at his disposal, and he got those funds, in large part, because of all these military victories in which he took all kinds of spoils and booty, which he used to fund his building campaigns in Rome.
and it also tells us something about his ambitions.
now I don't want you to get the impression that we never had big buildings before.
you can think back way to the beginning of the semester when we talked about Julius Caesar and his architecture, and his bragging that he had built a
or one of the authors of that period tells us that Julius Caesar had built a Temple to Mars, the biggest in the world.
so in its own day it was, supposedly, the biggest in the world.
but we're getting even more ambitious vis-? vis scale.
and I think--perhaps again I'm psychoanalyzing Trajan too much
but I think the fact that this is a man who had the ambitions that he did, to extend the Empire to its furthest reaches, seems to be in keeping with the kind of man who would want to make the buildings in Rome, that he built, a kind of microcosm of that hugely expanded Empire.
with regard to the plan of the baths, you will see that it follows the so-called Imperial Bath type that was initiated by the Baths of Titus, at least with regard to baths that are still preserved.
I mentioned to you, when we talked about the Baths of Titus, there may have been an earlier bath of Nero that actually followed this same Imperial Bath form.
but we're not absolutely sure about its plan, that is, the Neronian Baths.
they existed, but we're not absolutely sure about their plan.
but if we look back at the Baths of Titus, you'll remember that what made them distinctive, and what made them differ from the earlier Stabian Baths or Forum Baths at Pompeii, was the way in which they placed the bathing block in the center, rather than to the side;
that they arranged the main rooms-- the tepidarium, the frigidarium and the caldaria, in this case--in axial relationship to one another.
and then all the other rooms of the bath were displayed around those, in a symmetrical way.
so axiality and symmetry reigned supreme.
and then otherwise we saw here the rest of the precinct, with an elaborate entranceway over here.
we see roughly the same in the Baths of Trajan, in that again the bathing block is located right at the center of the structure, and the main rooms are aligned with one another axially.
if you look up to where it says Baths of Trajan that at the northern end is the entrance into the baths.
you enter from there, into N, which is a natatio or swimming pool; a piscina.
and then you can see that is surrounded by columns.
on axis with the swimming pool is the frigidarium, at F, and you can see, just like that of the Baths of Titus, it is a groin-vaulted room:
a triple groin vaulted room, as you can see by the three x's over the rectangular area.
it has a kind of an apse or exedra at the uppermost part, through which one comes from the natatio into the frigidarium, and you can see that is screened by columns.
then from there into the fairly simple, rectangularly shaped tepidarium, that serves more as a kind of passageway from the frigidarium, into C, which of course is the caldarium, or the warmest room, the sauna of the baths.
that also has a rectangular shape, but with these radiating alcoves, radiating alcoves that we're going to see are screened by columns.
and they are, of course, facing the southern end where the sun is, and that would, of course, help to heat the caldarium as well.
and then what we see though with regard to the Baths of Trajan, that make them differ from the Baths of Titus, and are part of this evolution of Imperial Bath architecture in Rome, is the fact that the bathing block is placed in this very large rectangular precinct.
and this large rectangular precinct has a series of rooms around it, as you can see, real rooms, and rooms that take all kinds of shapes.
many of them are these hemicycle type shapes, screened with columns from the larger central space, but some of them also look like the tabernae that we've become used to in plan.
we see all of those there, and these were used, as far as we can determine, as meeting halls, lecture halls, Greek and Latin libraries.
so there's this extension of the bath, from being just a place where you went for wellness essentially, to bathe and to relax and to have social interaction with your friends.
they are adding an intellectual element to the bath buildings, so that you can also go there if you want to read
if you want to go to the library and read Greek books, read Latin books
go to lectures, go to seminars, have conversations, intellectual conversations, are also beginning to happen here.
so the bath becomes even more of a mecca for people who are interested in intellectual life, as well as bathing and social life, which is a very important development culturally for the Romans.
note here also this great hemicycle, down here, which is part of the bath building
a hemicycle that had seats on it, which probably served for performances of whatever kind, that would have taken place here.
so that's another interesting addition to the bathing scene, and should you remind you of the kind of hemicycles that we saw, for example, in the Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia at Palestrina, or the Sanctuary of Hercules at Tivoli, where they also had those performance areas.
so bringing in some of those elements from sanctuary design, into bath design, in the Baths of Trajan in Rome.
the Baths of Trajan, some parts of them still exist, but scattered, and in fact they are located now in a kind of a pleasant garden area, as you can see here.
this is a Google Earth view that shows you their proximity to the Colosseum;
we see the edge of the Colosseum over here.
so the Esquiline Hill, in large part.
and you can just barely make out here-- if you look, see this curved wall, down here, that curved wall is in fact that hemicycle with the-- for the theatrical performances that I showed you, just before.
and that is actually the entrance -- for anyone going to Rome over break, that's actually the entrance to the Domus Aurea.
if it's open--it periodically closes, sometimes, if things are falling down--but if it's open, that's how one gets there.
and over here you can actually see this is the-- I may have shown this to you before
but this is actually the oculus of the octagonal room of Nero's Domus Aurea.
you can see it, if you wander through this park, you can see it from above, with a grate on top of it, as well as down below, if you visit the palace itself.
and then up here, you can see another-- just right up above my finger--you can see another curved wall, and there's another one somewhere down here, that are part of those curved rooms, those hemicycle-shaped rooms, that are these lecture halls and meeting halls and so on.
and actually that one, the one that's up here, actually has niches in the wall, with shelves, which indicates to us that that was used as one of the libraries.
the scrolls would have been placed on those shelves, and then have cupboards in front of them.
so one can see remains--it's made out of concrete, faced with brick--one can see remains on the top of that hill.
but a model over here gives you a better sense of what it looked like in antiquity.
we're again looking at that large hemicycle that served, with its seats that served for performances here.
we're looking at the outer precinct wall.
we can see the semi-domes of some of the hemicycles here.
and we can also see the bathing block; at the uppermost part, the entranceway;
the courtyard, surrounded by columns, which is where the pool or natatio was located.
the covered area here was the frigidarium; then the tepidarium.
the caldarium is here, and here you can see those radiating alcoves, with columns, that opened them up for vistas and the like, as well as to the warmth of the sun.
so an incredible bathing establishment, and one that has taken us a step further in the evolution of imperial bath architecture in Rome, and will serve as the major model for the two most famous and much better preserved baths in Rome, and that is the Baths of Caracalla and the Baths of Diocletian, which we'll look at later in the semester.
but I'd like to turn from the Trajanic baths to unquestionably the most important public building that was commissioned by Trajan during his reign, and I can't overemphasize enough the importance of this building in the history of Roman architecture.
and we're going to see that it is two part, in the sense that it has--it is a forum, it has the forum proper, and it also has markets appended to it.
they are done in a different architectural style, and herald something very important;
a very important development in Roman architecture that's going to be carried further by Trajan's successors.
what we're looking at here is a spectacular aerial view of the part of Rome in which the Forum of Trajan finds itself.
we are looking at buildings that we have looked at before;so we can get our bearings.
this is, of course, the wedding cake of Victor Emmanuel, over here.
you can see a part of the oval piazza, designed by Michelangelo, of the Campidoglio.
you can also see--what's this, down here?
Forum?-The Julian.
the Julian Forum, the Forum of Julius Caesar, much lower ground level than the rest of the city today.
and you can actually see those three columns, from the temple, that I showed you just before, as well as the tabernae of the Julian Forum.
and note the relationship of the Julian Forum to the Trajanic Forum.
he's restoring Julius Caesar's Forum, at the same time he's building his own.
I can also show you here--if you look right above my hand you can see the Piazza Venezia and the Palazzo Venezia.
if you look at the center of that building, right over the doorway, there's a balcony.
that is the famous Mussolini balcony;
that's the balcony from which Mussolini made all his speeches, with his followers gathering in the Piazza Venezia.
and from that, from the Piazza Venezia, the street that goes from there to the Piazza del Popolo, is the Corso, the racecourse, the Corso of Rome, which is one of the major streets of Rome, one of the major shopping streets of Rome, as well as one of the major thoroughfares, that takes you--if you go down halfway, take a right, and ultimately at the Piazza di Spagna, or the Spanish Steps, which of course is a trek that everybody who visits Rome follows that path, to see the Spanish Steps.
over here, the forum that we're going to be talking about today, the Forum of Trajan.
much of that forum is underground, and some of it was turned into a garden, as you can see here:
a pleasant park, as you can see here.
here we are looking at some of the columns from the Basilica that's part of that forum, from the very well-preserved Column of Trajan.
and also over here we'll see the markets of the forum.
but I just wanted you to get your bearings again in terms of where it's situated in Rome, and what it looks like today from the air, although it is changing all the time.
and I wanted to show you a Google Earth image as well, because this is much more up to date than the aerial view that I showed you just before.
and you'll see the same buildings.
you'll see the Victor Emmanuel Monument, and you'll see part of the Campidoglio.
you'll see the Mussolini balcony and the Corso, and you'll see the Column of Trajan, and part of the Basilica.
but what you see here is that park has been replaced by structures, because they are excavating.
I've mentioned this before, they are excavating more of this now, with the hope of someday rejoining the Roman Forum with the Imperial Fora.
that may not be able to happen, because of traffic concerns, but it is certainly something that's on the drawing board.
and at the very least, right now, without narrowing the street, the main Via dei Fori Imperiali, they are doing excavation in that park area.
and you can see what they've brought up.
this is not ancient, it's actually mostly Medieval houses.
I hope--I felt there are no Medievalists among you
but I hope they'll eventually realize that these are-- well, who's to say?
that they should probably remove these as well and take us back to the original Forum of Trajan;
I hope that happens someday. They're not very distinctive.
if one looks at them, they're just mainly rectangular rooms.
but nonetheless they're at that Medieval level now, and the question is whether they're going to go down any further.
but here you can see, not only the remains of the Forum of Trajan, but also the Forum of Augustus.
here's the Temple of Mars Ultor -- that great precinct wall that divided it from the Subura, also visible here.
and here we see the great hemicycle that we'll look at today of Trajan's Forum, behind it the Markets of Trajan.
it's important for us to look back at the general plan of the Imperial Fora, to see where the Forum of Trajan fits in.
we have already looked at the Forum of Julius Caesar, with its Temple of Venus Genetrix.
we have looked at the Forum of Augustus, with its Temple of Mars Ultor.
remember the exedrae on either side of that temple, the embracing arms, that were new at that time, and an important component of the Forum of Augustus.
Vespasian adds his Forum Pacis over here. Domitian adds a narrow forum, the so-called Forum Transitorium that served as a point of transit between the Roman Forum and the Subura here.
he puts a temple to his patron goddess, Minerva, in that forum.
but it is, at his death, it is taken over by Nerva and renamed the Forum of Nerva.
I mentioned to you, when we talked about the Forum Transitorium, that Domitian also had his eye on this property over here.
he had schemes as grandiose for public architecture, at one point, as for palatial architecture, but palatial architecture won out and he put all of his effort into the palace, on the Palatine Hill, and never realized any construction in this area.
when Trajan became emperor, he decided that he would again focus on public architecture, and that he would build a forum like none other before it.
and so he begins to do that.
now that was no small feat in this particular part of the city, because most of this area was occupied by a hill;
the so-called Quirinal--Q-u-i-r-i-n-a-l--the Quirinal Hill, in Rome, occupied most of this space.
so what he needed to do--it's great to have an architect engineer in your back pocket, so he set Apollodorus of Damascus to work.
he said: "You're a great engineer.
all you need to do is take down a good part of the Quirinal Hill to make way for this great forum that I want to build.
and lo and behold, Apollodorus was absolutely up to the job, and that's exactly what he sets out to do.
he removes 125 feet of the Quirinal Hill, in order to make way for the Forum of Trajan.
and that very number, 125 feet, is actually commemorated in the Column of Trajan, because the Column of Trajan was built to that very same height, 125 feet, to show you, as you stand in the forum, how much of that hill had to be cut back in order to make way for the forum.
you can see by looking at this plan of the Imperial Fora as a whole-- and this is
not only did Trajan take the Empire to its furthest extent, this is the last forum that was added to the Imperial Fora, in Rome.
you can see, by looking at it in connection to the others, that if you count it, plus the markets-- which you see wending their way up what was left of the Quirinal Hill here in plan
if you compare that to the others, you can see that the Forum of Trajan, and the Markets of Trajan, were almost as large as all of the other fora-- not counting the Roman Forum
but all of the other Imperial Fora together, which gives you some sense of why I called this "The Mother of All Forums.
now we're going to look at the plan of this, and I'm going to show you an individual plan in a moment.
but what I want to say, while this is still on the screen, is that I want you to look at the exedrae that you see on either side of the main space of the forum, and on either side of the basilica over here. These are not coincidental.
they are certainly meant to make reference to the exedrae of Augustus' forum.
Trajan modeled himself after Augustus. He became a kind of neo-Augustus.
he took on Augustus' hairstyle and his manners, and so he was trying to associate himself, in his life, with Augustus.
he's doing it here also, through architecture, by placing those exedrae on either side of his forum.
here's a plan of the forum itself, on the left-hand side of the screen, where we can see all of its major features.
you'd enter into the forum down here.
there was a very elaborate entranceway, here.
and you can see that the facade is actually not straight, but convex, convex:
a convex facade, which is very interesting, curved facade, with an elaborate entranceway over here.
the entrance into the main part of the forum, rectangular in shape.
there's a base here for an equestrian statue of Trajan.
the exedrae on either side, mimicking those of the Forum of Augustus.
colonnades, also on either side, and some additional columns here.
and we're going to see that just as in Augustus' forum-- another reference back to Augustus
that the columns in this main area are Corinthian below, but in the second tier there are figures -- not figures of caryatids, but different kinds of figures, and I'm going to show you those soon.
over here the basilica, which is perpendicular to the forum proper.
this is quite different from the Forum at Pompeii, where you'll remember the basilica was splayed off, to the side.
here we have it as a more integral part of the forum, and perpendicular to the main space here.
it's a very large basilica. It takes the name of Trajan's family.
his family name was Ulpius, U-l-p-i-u-s.
this is the Basilica Ulpia in Rome, with a central nave, and side aisles, a couple of side aisles around it.
so a veritable forest of columns, and then other exedrae, matching exedrae, or, in this case, apses on either end.
then through here you see the location of the Column of Trajan, in a small piazza, and to left and right, libraries, Greek and Latin libraries.
and then at the end, a temple.
we don't know what Trajan actually-- the northern end of the structure was not completed at Trajan's death, and we don't know if he would have put a temple there.
it's highly likely, because what forum have we seen, without a temple at the short end?
they all had them.
so it's a good guess that Trajan had that in mind too.
but the temple that was built there was actually built after his death, by his successor,
Hadrian: a temple that Hadrian put up to honor Trajan, and also Trajan's wife, Plotina, P-l-o-t-i-n-a.
now we know quite a bit.
a lot of the forum, some of the forum, is still preserved, and we have evidence for other parts of it that are not preserved.
this entrance gate, down here.
believe it or not, we have coins that have an entrance gate on them, and nicely they say--fortunately they say, down below, FORVMTRAIAN, Forum of Trajan.
so putting two and two together, we have to go on the assumption that what we are looking at here is a rendition, on a coin, of the entrance gate into the Forum of Trajan, FORVMTRAIAN.
and if we look at it here, we see some interesting things.
we see, first of all, that it has a single arcuation in the center -- so one doorway.
it has a series of bays, that have in them what we call aediculae, a-e-d-i-c-u-l-a-e, aediculae, which are little temple fronts that are-- niches with little temple fronts around them, with columns and pediments.
and then you can see statuary, inside those.
so a series of bays, decorated with these aediculae with statues.
then a series of circles with blobs in them.
I think those series of circles with blobs in them are probably portraits represented on shields, because we have remains of actual portraits on shields from the inside of the forum.
so that seems to be the case here as well.
and then in the uppermost part, we see that the gate looks very much like an arch, in the sense that it supports a quadriga, at the top, and that quadriga represents two people, possibly the emperor--again, we're dealing with blobs here;
we have to do the best we can to interpret them-- but they seem to be probably the emperor, and possibly Victory crowning him, the way we saw Victory crowing Titus in his chariot, on his arch.
six horses in this particular case, and then on either side trophies, these tree trunks decorated with captured arms and armor.
and we're not absolutely sure what's surrounding them in this case, whether they're prisoners or Roman soldiers.
so this gives you a very good idea of the entrance gate into this structure.
and I also want to point out, if you look very closely at the columns and the elements above them in the attic, you can see that the columns project, and the attic seems to have projecting entablatures.
so it looks as if we have the kind of scheme here that we saw in the Forum Transitorium, with that wall decorated with columns that project out of the wall, and that have projecting entablature, giving this undulation--undulating movement from projecting to receding, projecting to receding, across the facade of the entrance gate.
the figures that were located on the upper tier of the center
of the main body of this forum again were not caryatids, or female figures, but rather male figures: male figures of captured Dacians, because the war that Trajan had, that enabled him to celebrate and to fund this building, was his wars against the Dacians, D-a-c-i-a-n-s.
Dacia, ancient Dacia, modern Romania today.
Trajan had two military campaigns there, one from 102 to--excuse me, the first one from 101 to 102;
the second one from 105 to 107.
he was victorious in both of those, and this forum was built from the spoils of that war, to honor his victory over the Dacians.
and we see therefore that the figures that are in the uppermost tier, of the main body of the forum, are depictions of captured Dacians; of Dacian prisoners brought back to Rome.
you see two of them here.
here a headless figure, here a much more complete figure.
the headless figure still can be seen on the site, and the one on the left-hand side of the screen now in the Vatican Museums in Rome.
the one on the left gives you a better sense of what these looked like in antiquity.
you can tell that these are not Romans;
wearing leggings, a tunic, a fringed mantle, that the Romans did not wear, a long fringed mantle.
and then above you see that he has, unlike Trajan's closely cropped Augustan-type hairstyle, you can see he has very long hair, and also a beard, and this identifies him as a very different-- sort of boots that seem to be made out of suede or felt of some sort.
so a very different kind of image.
clearly these are again the Dacian prisoners, one after another, aligning that second tier.
and for any of you interested in the fact that the Romans made nearly exact duplicates of things, mechanical copies, you can see in this particular statue-- we rarely have this preserved, so it's an interesting example of these points-- you see these little excess pieces of marble.
the Romans had created a kind of pointing machine, which they used to make exact replicas of originals.
and they usually, when the statue was done, they would usually obviously take these away, carve them away, which they didn't do.
this one probably was not used, for some reason;
it was copied and never put up on the building, and so those points still remain.
this is a model of the Forum of Trajan, as it would have looked in antiquity, with that convex entranceway;
the location of the equestrian statue, the exedrae on either side here.
you can imagine the Dacians in the second tier.
the roofed Basilica Ulpia here.
the Column of Trajan, flanked by the Latin and Greek libraries, and then over here the Temple to Divine Trajan.
the plan, again, and here I just want to mention, looking back at that plan, that there was also another elaborate entranceway from the main part of the forum, into the Basilica Ulpia, on its long side.
and once again, how fortunate we are that we have coins that say BASILICAVLPIA, Basilica Ulpia.
so we can guess, I think quite accurately, that this must be the entranceway to the Basilica Ulpia.
here we see something different.
we see three openings, not arcuated openings but trabeated openings, straight lintels above.
but look again in the way in which they're represented.
it looks like they're quite solid, and that they project into the spectator's space.
so again this idea of projection, recession, projection, recession, across this facade.
this is very important because, as I mentioned, Roman architecture, using the traditional language of Greek architecture, ultimately developed something that we call a baroque trend in Roman architecture, and you see it happening here, in Rome, based on the experiments of Domitian's Forum Transitorium.
and you can see that same, roughly that same scheme here.
up above, once again, a chariot, in this case a four-horse chariot, seemingly with one figure, and a series of standards, being held, possibly by Roman soldiers.
the Forum of Trajan has been the professional, the life work of a professor, formerly of Northwestern University, James Packer, who spent a very long time pulling together all the evidence that the Forum of Trajan still provides, to allow a very good reconstruction of what that forum looked like.
it's computer generated. I urge you all to look at it.
if you just Google James Packer, Forum of Trajan, UCLA
because that's the, or the Getty, either of those two, because UCLA and the Getty supported this work
you will be able to see computer simulations of his work.
there's also a book by James Packer on the Forum of Trajan, that's on reserve for this course.
I send you to it, less for the Forum of Trajan, but for any of you working on city plans, again this could be a very inspiring book to look at.
not that I expect you to come up with something like this, but nonetheless I think it can give you an idea of what one can do as one thinks about designing one's own city.
he has done enough research to allow a very accurate reconstruction of what this forum would've looked like.
we're looking at the entranceway into the Basilica Ulpia here.
we are looking at the marble; you can see real marble and variegated marbles brought from all over the world.
so Trajan continues the Flavian tradition of bringing marbles from all over, from places outside of Italy--from Africa, from Asia Minor, from Egypt and so on
for the decoration of these buildings, and an interest in multicolored marbles as facing.
we see also up here the Dacian prisoners, and between them, in this instance, these shields, with portraits on them.
we have remains of some of those.
so that's an accurate reconstruction, the same sort of thing that we saw on the entranceway.
then up there an inscription, several other Dacians, and some other decoration at the apex.
I'm going to show you just a few of these quickly, from Packer's book.
you see here a corridor with a barrel vault, stuccoed and painted, lots of statuary.
there would have been lots of honorific statuary in this structure.
sometimes instead of the shields, with portraits between the Dacians, we see piles of captured arms and armor, as you can see in that view.
here a couple more, showing again the marble decoration of the walls, varied in color.
here niches with portraits. Over here, more shields with portraits.
and here you can see some of the sculptural remains:
some parts of a military figure in a breastplate, a man--both of them headless--a man in a toga.
and over here part of one of these decorative shields with a portrait.
we actually think this is a portrait of Nerva, a portrait of Nerva that would've been placed inside this shield and hung on the upper part of the wall above the columns.
and this is important, and on your Monument List.
this is a view of the Basilica Ulpia in Rome, what it would have looked like in antiquity.
you can see it conforms to basilican architecture that we've looked at before, with a central nave, divided by its two side aisles-- in this case, as you'll recall in plan
and those are Corinthian capitals, as you can see down here.
you can see also that it's a gargantuan structure.
look at the size of the people, the men in their togas, and the building itself.
and it had a flat roof with a coffered ceiling, and you can see that it had a clerestory.
we've talked about the clerestory before.
we saw it in the House of the Mosaic Atrium, for example, the clerestory, which is the opening up of the wall, in this case through Ionic columns, to see the vistas that lie beyond, and to let light into the structure.
and you can see the vista that lies beyond, of the Column of Trajan and one of the libraries.
this is a photograph that I'm incredibly proud of, because I took it from on top of the Column of Trajan.
it's not that difficult to climb the Column the Trajan because there's a spiral staircase in the center of it, that goes up to the top.
the part that's hard is getting permission to get in there.
it's always locked, and you have to get special permission to do that.
so I did it only once, but it was a great thing to do, and you go way up to the top, and you can look down.
you can see fantastic views of Rome.
but you can also get a very good sense of what the Basilica Ulpia looks like today: not much.
but you can see the central space. You can see some of the columns.
we can tell that those columns were grey granite.
so again, this interest in contrasting marbles, grey granite with white marble, in the Basilica Ulpia and elsewhere.
and you can also see the relationship between modern ground level, which is much higher, and ancient ground level, and the possibilities that still remain, if they want to excavate this part of the city
what more of the Forum of Trajan may be able to be seen.
some of it can actually be seen under the street, and Packer and others have actually gone in to look at what is there, which is what has enabled him to make the kind of accurate reconstructions that he has.
everywhere in this monument there are references--yes, this is a forum; yes, forums have practical purposes.
they're a place for people to meet and to market and to conduct law cases and so on, in the basilica.
but this monument reminds you again and again and again and again that it is a monument in stone to Trajan's victories over the Dacians.
and not only do we see those Dacians, as we looked at before, but we see lots of other imagery that refers to military victory.
this is a fragment of what we think was a frieze, in the Basilica Ulpia, that depicts victories, female personifications of victory, winged, either kneeling at candelabra, or over here, this woman, kneeling on the back of a bull.
you can see that she's winged. She's holding the snout of that bull back.
she's got a knife in her right hand, and she is about to slit the throat of the bull.
and she is doing this to--not only is victory over the Dacians being marked here, but she is also representing the sacrifice that takes place in honor of that victory by being shown depicting killing a bull.
back to the plan once again, just to remind you that when we leave the Basilica Ulpia-- a doorway also in its long side
we end up in this small plaza, where the temple--where the Column of Trajan is located, flanked by Greek and Latin libraries, on axis with the entranceway, the equestrian statue of Trajan the other entranceway, the column, and ultimately the temple, at the very end: the temple ultimately to divine Trajan.
this is a model of what we think the library may have looked like, or both of the libraries may have looked like from the outside
fairly smallish square buildings with a portico in the front, and then, most important, a balcony over here.
why a balcony?
so that you could come out and look at the Column of Trajan, and read some of the scenes that encircled it.
this is a reconstruction, from Packer again, showing what he thinks the interior of one of these libraries might have looked like.
it looks larger here than it actually was.
but you can get a sense of it, with the reading tables, with the scrolls inside these cabinets here, with the statuary, and in this case he believes that it had a vaulted roof, as you can see on top.
the Column of Trajan, you see it here in two views; an extraordinary work of art, extremely well preserved.
why so well preserved?
well likely because Pope Sixtus V, in the Renaissance, used this column, and also the column of the later emperor, Marcus Aurelius,
what he did, however, at that time, was that he took the statues of Trajan that would've stood on this one, and Marcus Aurelius on the other, and replaced them with statues of Peter and Paul.
and it's Peter who's on the Column of Trajan, and Paul who is on the Column of Marcus Aurelius.
but you can see how well preserved they are here.
the column shaft rests on a base, decorated with arms and armor, Dacian arms and armor, with a statue of Trajan up at the-- a bronze statue of Trajan at the uppermost part.
but what's particularly interesting is the sculpture-- I'm not going to go into that in great detail, but I want you to know about it, because it does tell us something about architecture, as we'll see.
it's a spiral frieze, done all in marble, of course, that wraps from the base of the column, all the way up to the top.
and it tells, in documentary form, the exploits, the military exploits of Trajan, in his two Dacian military campaigns
those two campaigns that I've already mentioned-- divided in the center by a Victory writing on a shield.
there's been a lot of speculation; there's nothing like this earlier in Roman art quite like this.
and so it is a new innovation, probably at the behest of
possibly out of the mind, the creative mind, of Apollodorus of Damascus.
and some scholars have suggested, and I think very convincingly, it's an intriguing idea, that because this was located between two libraries, the likelihood--and that the Romans had scrolls
the likelihood is what we are dealing with here is one of these scrolls, sort of wrapped around the column, from base to top, unfurled and wrapped around the column from base to top, with the text removed, with images instead of text.
and that makes a lot of sense, again given that you could view it best from the two libraries on either side.
a detail of the base, just to show you how very well preserved the sculptural decoration is.
this is not a course in sculpture.
I'm not going to go into this in detail, but I want to quickly show you some of the scenes, because again they can be revealing, from the point of view of architecture.
this is at the very base.
we see a personification of the Danube River, in that area up north, in Dacia, where the Romans went to conquer those tribes.
and this is very important, because we know that
Apollodorus of Damascus was responsible for building a bridge over the Danube River.
it was one of his great engineering feats.
and you actually see that bridge located here, which even increases the likelihood that Apollodorus of Damascus was the designer of this particular structure.
you see the Roman soldiers have gotten off boats.
they're walking through an archway. Here you see the Roman soldiers.
the Roman soldiers did not only do battle, but they also Romanized the areas that they went.
we've talked about this a lot: the colonization of the Roman world, Trajan extending the borders to their furthest most points.
the Romans get there, what do they do? They start to build architecture.
they start to build walls with headers and stretchers.
they start to build forts and city walls, in which they put buildings with Roman amenities.
remember, after the war is over, they're often given land by the general, or the emperor
it becomes theirs, and where they can live from that point on.
so they had every reason to want to fill these towns with Roman amenities.
and we see the Roman soldiers building cities in many of these scenes.
this is the most famous scene from the column, in which we see a battle between the Romans, inside one of these forts that they've built.
they are all with helmets and shields.
they have their hands around something;
we think these were probably spears that were added in metal, originally.
the Dacians down below.
you can identify them by their leggings and tunics and scraggly hair and beards, here.
they are attacking the camp.
the Romans are, of course, going to be victorious, and enemies who are pretty much the equals of the Romans in strength, which only underscores that the Romans were stronger still, to have conquered them.
and then over here, if you've ever wondered where the term 'battering ram' came from, you can see it right here--I told you the Romans invented everything-- you can see it right here:
this pole, with a ram's head at the end, which is serving again as a battering ram, as they try to tear down the walls of the Roman fort.
perhaps the most poignant and interesting scene happens way up at the top of the column, where the leader of the Dacians, Decebalus, D-e-c-e-b-a-l-u-s, is shown kneeling, almost like one of those Victories, on the bull.
he has a knife in his hand.
what is he doing? He is kneeling here.
he has decided--you can see the Romans;
he's got Romans to the left of him, Romans to the right of him.
he's about to be taken prisoner by them and paraded in a triumphal procession in Rome, in honor of Trajan.
he doesn't want to do that, so he heroically, valiantly, takes his own life.
he is about to plunge that knife into his heart, so that he doesn't have to be taken by the Romans.
it's very interesting to see them depicting, the Romans depicting, the Dacians in such a heroic way on this column.
I mentioned the museum in Rome that is located in EUR, the Museo della Civilt? Romana, the Museum of Roman Civilization, that has casts and models.
I mentioned that they had casts of all the scenes from the Column of Trajan.
I show you a view that I took in that museum, just to give you a sense of how one can see those, and how one can see those at eye's level, to get a good sense of them.
in antiquity they would have been harder to read.
but I should point out that the background was likely painted blue, and there probably would have been some additions, like the metal spears, that might have made it easier to read-- almost like Wedgwood--might have made it easier to read in antiquity.
and I also thought I would mention-- I'm sure all of you have been down to Ground Zero, but if you go a block or two away from Ground Zero itself, there's the Fireman's Memorial there, that was put up to many of the fireman who sadly lost their lives fighting those fires in the Twin Towers.
we see this here: "Dedicated to those who fell and to those who carry on" here.
and what's interesting about this, if you look, if you Google this and look at the website for the Fireman's Memorial in New York, you will find out that the designer for this talks unabashedly of his admiration for the Column of Trajan in Rome, and that he used, as an artistic model, for the way in which he massed figures here, showing them in relationship to buildings, he used, as his model, the figures on the Column of Trajan, in Rome.
at the end again, the column, surrounded by the Greek and Latin libraries, the temple over here at the end.
you can see it's a conventional Roman temple:
deep porch, freestanding columns, staircase, one staircase, facade orientation, just as we saw elsewhere.
here we see an engraving showing the spiral staircase that leads from bottom to top.
and over here, that the staircase also goes down below, into a burial chamber.
two urns were found in that burial chamber;
the urns of Trajan and Plotina, which tells us, of course, that this also served as Trajan's tomb.
so a victory, not only one of his great victories, military victories, but also victory over death.
and then at the apex, we see a good view of the top, with a statue of St. Peter; but we have coins depicting Trajan on
depicting the original statue--the base, the shaft, a portrait of Trajan, a naked portrait of Trajan, a heroicized portrait of Trajan, depicted after death, divinized at the apex of the column.
and if you read the inscription on the coin, you see it refers to Trajan as Optimus Princeps.
Trajan received many titles.
one was Dacicus, D-a-c-i-c-u-s, for his victories over the Dacians;
but at the end of his life Optimus Princeps, the greatest princeps of all time.
the implication: greater than Augustus.
and it is arguable, I think probably correct, that Trajan was the even greater of the two.
this is a restored view, a spectacular restored view, of the building complex, where you can see again the entranceway over here, the equestrian statue, everything that we've described.
but I think it's interesting, if you think of yourself having entered into this forum, standing here, looking back at the basilica bearing Trajan's name, looking toward the column and the temple.
what you would have likely seen when you stood here was only the uppermost part of the column;
because most of it would have been blocked by the very tall Basilica Ulpia.
so it's a very theatrical representation, in the sense that you would be standing here with Trajan, during life, looking back toward that column, looking back at the divinization of Trajan, a bronze statue, which would have seemed as if it was floating on top of the Basilica Ulpia.
this is a very dramatic tableau, created here by Apollodorus of Damascus.
and I think it was not equaled until the seventeenth century by architects like Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who also created such spectacular tableaus.
just to show you again the location of the Markets of Trajan, in relationship to the Forum of Trajan.
while the forum was the Romans imposing a rectangular plan on nature
remember, they have to cut back the hill, to make way for it-- the markets are something quite different.
they are the Romans accepting the shape of the remaining Quirinal Hill, and allowing the shape of that hill to determine the irregular shape of the markets.
the markets, unlike the forum that is madeout of marble, for the most part--as we've seen, variegated marble-- the markets are made out of concrete, faced with brick:
a very different material, but a material that is absolutely appropriate, when you want to cover a hillside with tiered buildings, looking back very much to the spa at Baia, looking back to Fortuna Primigenia, at Palestrina.
the same idea, to turn this hill, what remained of the Quirinal Hill, into essentially the precursor of the modern shopping mall.
you have shopping--there are 150 shops in the Markets of Trajan.
all of these things date, by the way, to the same period, around A. D.113, the forum and also the markets.
we see 150 shops here, on a variety of levels.
this is the bottom level, that is located where the exedra, the first exedra is, on the right side.
a great hemicycle, with shops.
here, a street, called the Via Biberatica;that name is on your Monument List.
and then a covered bazaar up here.
all of this on different levels;all of this done in a very innovative way, with concrete faced with brick.
you can also see here the very large windows the semi-dome, that I'll show you in detail in a moment.
these large windows indicate to us that the architects are real masters of the concrete medium here, able to de-materialize the wall, by putting up these very, very large windows.
that's how good they were in building this, at this point.
the building block here is essentially the taberna:
not, unlike what we saw in Pompeii, this small space with a barrel vault, an attic window above, and in this case with a post and lintel scheme made out of travertine, to mark the entranceway into the shop.
they took this individual motif and they replicated it throughout this building, over and over and over again, offering 150 possibilities.
here you see a series of these in a row, a series of these tabernae, with their attic windows, with their travertine decoration, with their sidewalks a kind of mini city within a city.
and then over here the polygonal masonry of the streets, looking very much like streets in Rome.
here is a view of the great hemicycle, down on the first story.
we see the shops again.
what's interesting here is in the second story you see arcuated elements.
you can see the facing with--the brick facing, although we do believe this was stuccoed over, in this case.
here, pilasters. But look very carefully.
you'll see these pilasters support, in the center, an arcuated pediment, and then on either side these broken triangular pediments, as if the pediment has broken, been broken, to allow the arcuated pediment to show through.
we have never seen that before.
Yes, we saw it in the paper topics, but that stuff is later.
we have not seen that, up to this point chronologically, in built architecture.
we have seen it in painting--Cubiculum at the Met, over here, for example
this breaking the triangular pediment to allow something else to show through.
this is the beginning of this experimentation that ultimately leads to this baroque element in Roman architecture that I'm going to talk about.
behind the hemicycle, annular vault, with an additional set of shops, and attic windows there as well.
this is the most famous street, from the Markets of Trajan.
it's an incredible place to wander, by the way.
and they have just recently, in the last couple of years, opened an entirely new museum here, which has a lot of remains from the forum, from the markets, and a great deal of very useful information an absolute must-see for anyone going to Rome.
this is the famous Via Biberatica of the Markets of Trajan, where again you get the sense, once you're in here that you're in a kind of city within a city, but with all these wonderful shops.
you can see how skilled they are in using ramps, with polygonal masonry, as well as sidewalks and stairs, so that you can make your way up with either alternative here.
again, the tabernae on either side;the opening up of the walls, with these incredible windows throughout.
a restored view of what the whole thing looked like in antiquity:
the hemicycle;the decoration here of the central arcuated pediment; broken triangular pediments over here
a very interesting space, that I'm going to show you in a second
vaulted with a semi-dome, done out of concrete, with very large windows opening up the space.
the Via Biberatica, that we already saw here, and then the covered bazaar up there.
a quick view of the semi-dome, made out of concrete.
it doesn't have an oculus, but otherwise it looks kind of like the dome of the Temple of Mercury at Baia, as you can see.
and over here, this wall that I've already described, that shows you how well the Romans can work concrete, now enabling them to open up the wall, much more than they've been able to do so before, and allow even more light into the structure.
the greatest part, perhaps, of the Markets of Trajan is this building here.
it's the covered bazaar, and it really is a market bazaar, on two tiers.
you can see in this restored view, this series of tabernae down below;the attic up above.
you can see that groin vaults are used here, in an incredible way.
I'll show you in a moment how.
a second story up here, with additional tabernae, opened almost completely to the sky, an incredible feat on the part of Apollodorus of Damascus, assuming he also designed these markets.
here is the market hall, as it looks today.
what is its ancestor?
the Ferentino Market Hall that we saw way back when, with its single barrel vault;
or some of the cryptoporticuses that we also saw, with their barrel vaults.
it's that idea, that market hall idea.
but look how sophisticated the Romans have become in their use of concrete faced with brick.
they have realized that they don't even need a wall, to support vaults.
they can lift their vault on top of individual piers, as they have done so spectacularly here;lift them up.
I described this, I think, in the introductory lecture as in a sense opening up a series of umbrellas over the space.
they have opened it up so that light can flow in from the sides;
light can flow in from either long end just flooding the whole system with light.
down below, again, the typical markets, with their attic windows above.
but this is a real tour de force probably the greatest
certainly the greatest vaulting that we have seen thus far, and again a test to just how far the Romans have come from this to this, by the time of the emperor Trajan.
and any of you headed to San Francisco, if you go to the Marketplace there, you will see that that owes so much to Roman antiquity, with all the tabernae-like structures on either side; the vaulting.
I mean, this sort of thing absolutely presupposes this kind of architectural development.
in the one minute that remains--and that's all I need for this
I just want to show you one last monument, and make one basic point about it, that really has more to do with the transition from Trajan to Hadrian, than anything else.
an arch went up, not in Rome, but in a place called Benevento, which is about an hour's drive from Naples, in the south of Italy, in Campania;a place called Benevento.
an arch went up between 114 to 118, honoring Trajan, and all of Trajan's accomplishments.
you can see it's covered with sculpture, and each of those scenes represents one of the accomplishments of Trajan.
it was put up on the so-called Via Traiana, taking Trajan's name, a road that was built from Rome to Benevento, and was opened during Trajan's reign, and again, a compendium of all his accomplishments.
you can see very clearly that it is based in general form on the Arch of Titus in Rome:
a single central arcuated bay;the pedestals supporting double columns on either side;
the inscription at the top;the receding panels on either side of that inscription.
the major difference, of course, between the two, that this has sculpture only on the inside, and sparingly in the center and around the frieze, and this has much more sculpture, again telling us in much greater detail a list
or describing a list of the great accomplishments of Trajan.
the main reason that I show it to you today, besides to show that the Flavians again served
flavian architecture served as an important model for Trajanic architecture, is that a couple of the scenes in the attic above are very interesting, and tell us something about the succession.
hadrian does not appear in the lower part of the arch, in any of the scenes, but he appears in two of the scenes in the uppermost part, which has led scholars,
I think rightly, to conclude that the arch was finished up to the attic before Trajan's death, and that Hadrian finished it.
and what did he do?
he put his own portrait up there, with Trajan's.
why was he motivated to do that?
well he had an ego, as we'll see when we talk about Hadrian's architecture.
but more than that, it had something to do with the succession.
we know that Trajan died on August 8th in 117 A. D.
we know that on August 8th he had no successor officially chosen.
Plotina, his wife, was--she had no children of her own;
she was crazy about Hadrian, very much his sponsor, and wanted to see him succeed Trajan.
it's likely that Trajan had the same idea in mind, but it's a little strange, because wouldn't he then have adopted him before his death?
why would he have waited?
but Plotina decides--she consults with advisors.
she says: "We're not going to announce Trajan's death.
we're going to keep it a secret.
tomorrow we're going to announce that Trajan has adopted Hadrian.
that happens on August 9th
and then it was only on the 11th, the 11th of August that Trajan's death was announced to the public.
so some hanky-panky was going on behind the scenes.
but whoever made the choice, whether it was Trajan himself or Plotina, they made a great choice: Hadrian, an extraordinary emperor as well.
and the one point that I want you to hold, and keep with you over break, and bring back when we get back together and talk, when we get back together, about the Pantheon and Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli, the main point that I want you to keep in mind is what we learned from the Forum of Trajan, and that is that Trajan combined, in an incredible way, with the help of Apollodorus, traditional architecture in the form of the Forum, with its marble columns and the like, and innovative Roman architecture, in the form of the brick-faced concrete market brought those together in one building, in a way that is very different from anything we've seen up to this point.
and we're going to see that Hadrian keeps that tradition alive, not only in the Pantheon, but also in his Villa of Tivoli.
I wanna get in on the ground floor.
I got an appointment with a judge, and then we're off to Rome.
I wanna get in on the ground floor.
Rome, Italy?
what other Rome is there? -There's a Rome, Georgia.
who the hell would honeymoon in Rome, Georgia?
I bet it happens.
anyway, tomorrow I'm gonna come home in the middle of the day...
when she's not expecting me, and without saying nothin'...
I'm gonna play "Leavin' On a Jet Plane" on the guitar.
after which, I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Oh, man, that's a classic. I love that song.
sad song for a happy occasion.
admittedly. It's the only song I know.
maybe she'll think you runnin' off with another woman.
Colleen's not that smart, and even if she did think that...
she'd probably run off crying.
you don't know Colleen. -Women are unpredictable.
I have some compromising pictures to mail.
excuse me?
I saw a poster at the grocery store.
you know that radio station, WXI U?
they're having a talent contest...
and the winner gets a thousand dollars...
and a recording contract.
Colleen, I'm not "singer guy.
I'm "art dealer guy.
but you have such a beautiful voice.
you have a talent.
it'd be criminal not to use it.
I can't.
forget that old girlfriend.
Mary.
Yes, Mary.
forget about her. She's the past.
I want you to sing.
you have to believe in yourself, 'cause I believe in you...
and I don't want to be wrong.
now that that's settled, let's get some brunch.
I can't. -Why not?
cause I have to get rid of the murder weapon.
Hey, cuz.
how did I know I'd find you drinking in the middle of the afternoon?
I don't know, cuz.
I guess you're one of those clairvoyants, huh?
Hey, how's the hit man business doing?
would you keep your voice down, please?
look, I got a favor to ask you.
Mr. Fancy Pants" has to ask old "Mr. Down And Out" for a favor.
this ought to be rich. -Shut up.
here.
a gun.
that's hilarious. Wait a second.
don't tell me you finally went and killed somebody.
look, I need you to ditch this for me, okay?
why don't you ditch it? You're the hit man.
I just sell sinks for a living, remember?
don't kid yourself, Rex. You assist a man who sells sinks.
I can't ditch it 'cause I have a lot to do today.
why don't you have one of your Mafia friends ditch it for you?
how many times do I have to tell you we're not the Mafia?
we're Irish.
okay, okay. Take it easy.
look, I don't want to get involved with any of this crap.
maybe this will alleviate some of your fears.
two hundred dollars?
good.
take the gun and throw it in a lake or something.
nothing's gonna happen unless you screw it up.
Colleen. -Yeah?
I hate to be a party pooper, but my legs are getting cramped.
all right. We don't have to hide anymore.
something must have happened to Dick.
can we eat the cake? -Sure.
I got it.
Hello?
Hi, Danny? You told me to call this number at 9: 00.
what?
you said to call at 9: 00. -What the hell are you talking about?
it's 9: 00 and you said to call.
Oh, yeah?
screw you too, then, Dick!
boy, you're not gonna believe this.
that was Dick. He is at the airport.
he's running away with another woman.
guess the surprise party's off.
wow, look at the time.
see you.
night.
see you. -Yeah.
gosh, that was really smart. -It was, wasn't it?
now the police won't suspect anything when Dick turns up missing.
I don't know. Something could go wrong.
no, nothing's gonna go wrong. Everything is gonna go right.
we got away with it.
but I'm a killer. -But you're really good at it.
I am? -Yeah!
you should be proud of yourself. You're a natural.
lots of people can't do what you do. -Really?
Yeah, really. -Who's that?
I don't know. Somebody probably forgot something.
let me get it.
hurry back. -Okay.
yes?
you Colleen Gibson?
Yes.
O'Halloran. -Murphy.
may I help you?
you're on the wrong side of the fence to be asking questions.
what side am I on?
the wrong side. -How well you know Pee Wee Greelitch?
who? -John Greelitch.
nicknamed "Pee Wee" due to his immense girth.
I don't know anyone named Pee Wee. -Funny.
he knew you.
at least well enough to be beaten to death by one of your paintings.
what?
just spill your guts about Pee Wee Greelitch.
I don't understand.
pee Wee was beaten to death by your painting.
perhaps you could shed some light on this interesting scenario.
painting was blue. -Real blue.
I sold that painting.
I sold it a long time ago at an art fair.
now we're getting somewhere. -To whom?
I don't remember.
if there's one thing I hate, it's a poor memory.
he was a large man.
with brown hair? -Yes.
brown eyes? -I believe, yes.
perfectly round head?
Yes, it was a spherical-shaped head. -Damn!
that's Pee Wee all right. -You described him to a tee.
sorry to disturb you, ma'am. I guess our hunch was wrong.
that's all right.
all right, if that's it...
good night.
you were great. You handled those cops like a real pro.
you really led them down the wrong path.
I don't suppose you can tell me why the painting I sold you yesterday...
ended up in the head of some dead thug.
I sold that painting at my gallery.
where is your gallery? -It's down by all the other galleries.
I want to go. -Now?
Yeah, I want to go now. -It's closed.
but I assume you have a key. -Yes.
I have a key.
no.
you're not a gallery owner, are you? -I don't want to make you mad.
you have a job that's gonna make me mad?
we have to go somewhere private. Then I'll tell you.
we're in my house. How much more privacy do you need?
this is private?
I'm sensing something is wrong.
Yes, something is wrong.
I've had a pretty crummy week.
I accidentally killed my boyfriend because he was cheating on me...
and now I found out that you're not an art dealer.
I can explain. -Are you a porn star?
No! -Are you a Republican senator?
are you in the Mafia?
Yes.
Yes, but we're not the Mafia. We're Irish.
are you joking?
I'm a hit man, but I swear I have never killed a person in my life.
that's a good one. You're a hit man who's never killed anyone?
do you think it's easy to admit I'm a hit man who can't kill?
it's embarrassing.
I hope you see the irony here. I am a hit man, okay?
I have never broken a law in my entire life...
and you, the innocent artist...
just killed her boyfriend!
to compare my murder, which was an act of love...
wait, of love? You didn't love Dick.
he sure as hell didn't love you, but I do.
do what?
love you. Okay?
I love you.
you said, "I love you." -Yes.
I love you.
there, I said it. I love you.
Really?
I dumped a body for you. I got rid of a murder weapon.
where I'm from, that's love.
I love you.
excuse me.
I have to go talk to a wayward relative, okay?
what are you doing? Get rid of that thing.
no, listen. I'm beginning to grow attached to it.
I think it has special powers.
just get rid of it or I'll kill you.
all right, it's gonna make Christmas...
real uncomfortable for the families, huh?
stop being such a dick.
asshole.
that was fun.
I could do that every night of my life.
that's a nice thought. It's probably not gonna happen.
I'm in dutch with my boss.
how dutch?
dutch dutch. -What's this?
they're drug dealers. Scum of the earth.
they sell crack to schoolchildren.
you're supposed to kill them?
Yes.
but I can't do it.
Yes, you can!
Yes, you can. It's not that hard.
it's like jumping off the high board.
you just have to decide to do it.
sure, that's easy for you to say. You're a natural.
I can't do it. I'd take the gun, and I'd...
point the gun and it makes that...
horrible exploding sound.
that's all right.
it's all right. You're still a good person.
and Jared, he's my boss and he's my brother-in-law.
he threatened to kill me if I don't kill these people.
jeez. Think he's serious?
I once saw him stab a guy to death with a soup spoon.
we'll just go run away somewhere. Some where Jared won't find us.
I have some family money. -He's gonna find us wherever we go.
I just have to face the fact...
that I've just got a few days to live.
but I'm gonna make them the best few days of your life.
there has to be some way out.
I got it.
what? -I'll do your hits.
no. -Yeah, I'll do your hits.
I'm not gonna have you do my killing for me.
I'd do anything for you.
come on, it's the least I can do for you.
come on.
I love you.
Really?
now, when you kill them, you have to make sure they're dead.
Yeah, I know. You told me that already.
just make sure to put a bullet in their brain.
you told me that already too.
and if anything goes wrong- -I get the hell out. I know.
all right, give me the gun.
give me the gun.
it has a silencer attached.
so I don't wake up the whole neighborhood.
all right. I know.
I'll see you later.
Colleen. -Yes?
just be careful.
let's go get some dinner. -What?
maybe Chinese or something?
were they there? -Oh, yeah.
did you...
Oh, yeah.
are you sure? -Yeah. Yeah.
come on. Let's go. I'm starving.
whatever you say.
Wally Lemon. kiddie pornographer.
is this where you put Dick?
Yes.
it's fitting.
Oh, God! -What's wrong?
look at my dress.
this is the third good dress I've ruined doing this job.
blood doesn't wash out so easily.
don't worry about it. We're done. You're done.
that's five. That's the deal I made with Jared.
good.
now you can headline at the Shillelagh Room...
and win the WXI U talent contest.
Yes, and we'll be on...
easy Street.
you know what I think?
would you please stop doing that?
I think that day of reckoning I was talking about is coming.
I can feel it.
who is that man?
just a crazy old man. Let's just go.
he's dirty.
it's gonna come.
that's it.
five.
I'm through.
here's number six.
no, Jared.
you said after five I'm done.
I meant after six.
you know, this whole...
killing thing...
it's really getting on my nerves.
well, if that the way you want to play it.
you love Ivy, don't you, Danny?
what are you getting at?
be a shame if anything was to happen to her.
besides, I thought you'd want this one...
with this being the man that stole away the lovely Mary's heart.
you want me to whack the Tuner?
see, life is fair sometimes, isn't it, Danny?
just do this last hit.
pick up the envelope.
save your sister.
Daniel, I really love you.
I just don't know if can keep on killing for you.
Colleen, just one last hit.
and we're through. Jared promised.
all right. What's his name?
did Jared tell you why he wanted him killed?
I don't know why he wants him killed. He just wants him killed.
well, jeez, Daniel...
do you ever ask any questions?
if they asked you to go kill your own grandmother...
you think you'd bother to ask why?
what are you, a "question-aholic"? -What's that supposed to mean?
Hello? -Danny, this is Jared.
your sister had another one of her accidents.
the doctor said she'd be fine, but you better come out here.
okay.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Hey, Ivy. -Do you love me, Danny?
sure I do.
then kill Jared.
I don't think that would be a wise career move on my part.
I want him dead, Danny. He's fooling around behind my back.
he wouldn't do that to you.
stop taking his side. He treats you like an idiot.
do you really think he's gonna let you headline at the Shillelagh Room?
how do you know he's fooling around on you?
I hired a detective. Some clown named Rasmusson.
who's apparently skipped town, because I can't get a hold of him.
anyway, he mailed me these pictures...
taken at the Pink Flamingo Motel.
that's when I took the sleeping pills.
he's doing a nun?
she's not a real nun.
according to Rasmusson, Jared likes to go to this fantasy strip club...
and pick up these strippers who dress in these kinky costumes.
all right.
all right.
I'll do it. I'll rub Jared.
Danny, that's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
would it be fair to say that you not the best lunch companion right now?
I've been neglecting you. I know it.
I'm really sorry. Let's try to enjoy the rest of our meal, okay?
okay.
this is Mary, my old girlfriend.
Yeah, I know.
Danny, I'm sure you know the Tuner. -Hi. How you doing?
so do you want to sit down?
we just ate, but yeah, sure.
what, Tuner?
do you want to go to the restroom?
you want to use the phone. Yeah, sure.
he's gone to a dark, secluded part of the restaurant.
Yeah. Alone.
I guess I'd better powder my nose.
so, how are you, Danny?
great. Fine. How are you?
I can't take it anymore.
it's so awful living with the Tuner.
I never understand a word he says.
he's so violent.
unlike you, Danny.
you were always so gentle.
I guess I made a big mistake when I left you.
Yep, I guess you did. -Yeah.
is there anyway I can win you back?
use the phone?
no.
just be a minute.
I'm sorry. This is the wrong secluded hallway.
sorry, Mary.
see, I found a really special girl.
I understand. I guess this is good-bye, then.
Yeah. -I'm moving to Nebraska to find myself.
Yeah. -Great, yeah.
did you...
no, I didn't, and I want to go home.
there's been a misunderstanding.
there's no misunderstanding.
you're leaving, and you're never coming back as long as you live.
you're not gonna visit me.
you're not gonna call me. You're not even gonna think about me.
this killing is making you a little bit temperamental.
I'm not temperamental, I'm mad. There's a difference.
you asked me to kill your ex-girlfriend's boyfriend.
that's not a normal relationship request.
that was a coincidence.
Yeah, sure.
just like the rest of them.
you're just using me to get what you want.
I almost trusted you.
good-bye, good luck and get out.
and Daniel?
yes?
I hope you do really crummy at the talent show tonight.
Hi, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but did you know...
that the Lord Jesus Christ watches your every move?
Yes.
Yes. You're a brother in the spirit, just like me.
forty-two. -Psalm 42 is one of my favorites too.
the deer that-" -Forty-two.
there's 42 dead bodies buried out there in that yard.
you know what? Brother, I think I'm gonna come back tomorrow.
there's 42 dead bodies out there. -Let go of me.
you need to sober up. -You take me.
No! Let go of me! Help!
let go of me, you fat retard!
that's it, hurt me!
spank me! Call me Cheesy-weezy!
come on!
sorry to interrupt. -Danny, what are you doing here?
now I see why you wanted Dick Rasmusson killed.
all right, Danny. I'll give you $2, 000 not to tell Ivy.
what you don't understand is you're just my boss, but Ivy's my sister.
Oh, my God!
put the gun away, Danny. -No.
Danny, I order you. Put the gun...
you always told me the one with the gun gave the orders.
Oh, my God. He's gonna kill us. -No, he's not.
he doesn't have the guts.
that's what you think. -You can kill him, just don't kill me.
I'm premed. -Shut up!
what is the deal with crossing guards?
they're the sirens of the school system.
you know what your problem is, Jared?
you can't see what's right in front of you.
what's right in front of me, Danny, is a dead man.
I'm talking about love. Ivy loved you!
who's Ivy? -Shut up! Love is a rare thing, Jared.
you ought to hold onto it when you get an opportunity.
what the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about killing you. And her!
go on. Pull the trigger. You don't have the guts. Go on!
I will. -Do it!
I will. -Go ahead!
I knew you didn't have the guts.
who's been making your hits?
we're back. -You remember us.
of course I remember you. -We got an anonymous tip.
from some guy.
so I guess Daniel did find a way to get back at me.
excuse me?
nothing.
this tip led us to a junk yard. -A junk yard with 42 bodies in it.
all dead. -One of them was Dick Rasmusson.
a PI. -And one punch short of a free latte.
sad, really. And his death too.
but here's where the story gets weird.
a few days ago, me and Murphy were in a strip bar.
we get horny like everyone else. -And we meet this PI.
a real clown named Rasmusson. -Said he had a gal.
a gal named Colleen. -A gal he was going to marry.
what?
of course, we didn't put two and two together until after 5: 00.
and that's quitting time.
you don't seem real surprised that Dick's dead.
I am surprised.
I'm just shocked.
don't you think it's strange that one day some mob goon...
is killed by your painting, and the next day...
we're digging the body of your fiance out of a pile of pop cans?
there's even more.
we found this punk sink salesman shot to death in the park.
and the slug the lab pulled out of him matched the slug in the PI.
we haven't found the gun.
I think it has special powers.
don't screw it up.
Oh, man.
two bodies. One gun.
that's why we want to search your house.
well, you'll need a search warrant.
first place we check in any suspicious murder case is the basement.
all novice killers hide their victims in the basement.
some psychological thing, like burial. -I think it symbolizes hell.
it's burial. Hey, cool, a guitar!
this thing's out of tune.
probably has something to do with this bullet hole in the back.
that would do it. Hey, there's blood on this guitar.
a little vinegar would take that out. -I'd use dish soap.
I hear the teakettle boiling.
that was a door locking, wasn't it?
Yeah. I think so.
did you do it? Did you kill him?
not quite.
but I detained him...
and when he wakes up...
so you gotta get out of town.
two tickets to Rome. -Are you coming with me?
no, I'm going to the talent show to sing my heart out.
then I'm gonna find the woman I love and ask her to marry me.
good-bye, Daniel Gallagher.
welcome to the WXI U talent show.
I'm Dash Davis, but you know that.
okay, tonight we have a lot of great folks here to entertain us...
and I am just standing in the way up here.
so let me introduce a bunch of nice young men...
push! Come on, push!
Bye, Daniel Gallagher.
and now, ladies and gentlemen...
get your handkerchiefs and your whiskey bottles out...
as here is Daniel Gallagher to sing "Danny Boy.
are calling
from glen to glen
and down the mountain side
the summer's gone
and all the roses falling
it's you, it's you
must go and I must bide
this kid is good.
Yeah, he's good. Why don't you take a doughnut break?
I can't take a break. I'm Dash Davis, the emcee.
I think you need a doughnut.
it's I'll be here
in sunshine or in shadow
Oh, Danny boy
Oh, Danny boy I love you so
and I shall hear -Isn't that Daniel Gallagher? -One of Jared O'Reilly's boys.
what's he doing here? -I don't know.
let's arrest him and ask questions later.
wait a minute. -What?
it's "Danny Boy.
in peace until you come to me
and I shall hear
and tell me that you love me
so then I discover that not only does he want me to bump off...
his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend, he's gonna turn me over to the cops.
probably so he can, you know...
live happily ever after with his angel, Mary.
wow, that does suck. -See, I told you.
until you come
to
me
thank you very much.
well, that's the big finish. I better go plug him.
thank you very much.
that song is dedicated to the woman I love.
Yeah, Mary. -Colleen Gibson.
keep your metal in your pockets, boys.
I'm only here for one chicken. Oh, Danny boy.
you can sing, but you sure can't kill.
I knew you never made any of those hits, starting with Dick Rasmusson.
say hello to Saint Patrick.
who are you?
I'm Colleen Gibson.
and I'm a hit man.
excuse me, pardon me. -Sorry about that.
and I'm a very, very dangerous woman.
Jared O'Reilly, you're under arrest. -For the murder of Dick Rasmusson.
I didn't kill Dick Rasmusson.
he did kill Dick Rasmusson. He told me so himself.
a confession.
no, no, wait a minute. I killed Dick Rasmusson.
I'm a very dangerous hit man! -She didn't kill anyone.
she's nothing. -Oh, yeah?
I've done it before. What's one more?
what are you so angry about? -Well, for one, there's Mary.
that's a nice place to start. -She means nothing to me.
besides, she moved to Nebraska to find herself.
all right, but there's also...
the anonymous tip the police got about the bodies in the dump.
sorry to interrupt, but the anonymous tip was from a guy named Hurley.
okay, so I guessed wrong on that one.
all right, O'Reilly. Down to the station house with you.
what happened to your eye?
I was ironing a shirt, and someone telephoned me.
I would never turn you in. I love you.
you don't love me. -I do love you.
if I didn't love you, would I give you this?
it's not a gun.
Colleen Gibson, will you marry me?
should I kill you...
or marry you?
marry him! -Marry me.
I love you. I honestly love you.
you said the most important thing in the world is trust.
it's what every relationship is made of. You gotta trust me on this.
I love you. I love you with all my heart, Colleen.
you gotta believe.
I wasn't really gonna kill you. I was just really mad.
that's understandable.
and the winner is Daniel Gallagher.
I won!
thank you. Thank you.
that's our show. WXI U, I'm Dash Davis.
I parked out back for the quick getaway.
Colleen! Great job. I am so proud of you.
you know, you really do have a gift for this whole killing thing.
I know!
maybe you could direct your talents in other ways, though.
you know? Something more artistic, less deadly.
how about opening a dress shop? -No.
I want to fence stolen goods.
people always like a good soap store. -Numbers running!
flower stall? -Racketeering?
do you even know what racketeering is? -No, what is it?
I don't know. Anyway, no more killing.
but I'm good at it. -No more killing!
okay, no more killing.

Cheers. - For you, the drink?

no, they're for my dad. I don't drink.
dear Doris, I'm seeing a lovely girl "and we want to take thing to the next stage "but I'm afraid of hurting her because I'm too bit too well-en...endowed.
endowed.
I'm 24, she's 23, "and we've been together for four months, "but previous girlfriends have said "having sex with me has made them sore afterwards.
is there anything I can do about it?
erm... "I think this girl's the one for me, "and I don't want to hurt her.
Doris says, "Being well-endowed can be much more tricky than being small.
foreplay is extra important, but as long as you make sure your girlfriend is completely aroused "and are skilful, you can give her pleasure without pain.
no, no, no, don't take pictures, son. - Sorry.
I don't want everyone to know what's in 'ere.
what's your name? - Marek.
Marek. You and your dad settling in all right?
you live upstairs, don't you? - Yeah.
Yeah. My name's Graham. Graham Cutler, I'm from a long line of Cutlers.
I see you got this lovely Man United shirt on.
let me tell you something, Marek, people round 'ere, they don't really appreciate Manchester United.
to keep you safe, Marek, I want to give you a little present.
wait there. - OK.
I think you should put it on straight away without delay, just for safety purposes.
for me? - Yeah. Try it on.
OK. - Yeah.
give me your camera. - OK.
there you go.
it should fit.
try it on. Put it on over the other one.
OK.
Yes, much better!
arsenal - champions!
you see that? That'll keep you safe.
now, you can keep that for nothing. That's free.
all you gotta do is help me with a little bit of unloading - is that all right?
OK. - Yeah?
here, look, take these and put them on the left in there.
the left-hand side just round there.
can you take two at a time? Is that all right?
Yeah, got it?
big strong boy, ain't you? Yeah, good.
you all right, mate? - How are you?
fine. - What's goin' on?
where you from? You're not from round here.
I'm from the Midlands. - Oh, OK. Not bad.
you got a beer? - No.
nice smooth hair you got, what shampoo do you use?
head & Shoulders. - Can I have some?
Why? - I want some. Can I have some?
don't take the piss. - Go on, be a good boy.
Yeah! - Is it nice?
do some of that. - Save me some of that.
that's buff, you should try that, man. - You don't mind if I have a little bit?
no. - Better not.
how's that? - It's good stuff.
finish that, finish that.
that's the way to do it. - That's the way.
you don't mind, do you?
Cheers, you ain't got another one, have you?
so what brings you down 'ere?
I'm just down here. I just come down.
just come down? - What for?
just to, I dunno, see the sights.
ain't to start trouble, is it?
no. - Good.
that's a nice jacket, man, where'd you get that from?
shop. - How much did it cost?
dunno. - Let me try it on.
look at these!
those ones are nice.
I've gotta go. - Where you going?
I've gotta wait for my mate.
I thought you said you was down here from the Midlands.
wait, where you going, mate?
- I'm going to me mate's.
come here. We only want to talk to you.
Hey, come here!
Hey, catch him, catch him!
Hey, come here!
what you running for? I said I wanted to talk to you.
gimme that bag. - Give him that bag!
stomp him, stomp him. - Aargh!
Aargh!
shit! - Come on, let's go.
get the bag, get the bag. Go on, go, go, go!
loser!
all right?
Tomo, what the hell happened to you?
Oh, these three lads last night.
Oh, Tomo!
see, I told you, it's rough here.
did you get mugged?
well, they took my bag and some of my stuff and that.
have they taken your money?
Oh, Tomo, are you all right?
Jesus, God, look at you.
there you go, sweetheart. All right? - Thank you. Thanks very much.
here y'are. Get that down you.
Thanks.
so, what you gonna do?
I don't know.
I've got nowhere to go...nothing at all, no bag, no money, no clothes...nothing.
won't it be better going back home?
I hated it. I've got nothing at all.
what about your pals?
they're not me real mates, they're just people I know.
useless waste of space, like me.
don't think like that.
well, it's true.
can you do me a favour, please?
can you lend me some money?
I'll buy you a train ticket.
what about if I pretended it was for a train ticket?
you've got some cheek.
here's a tenner.
thank you.
I've gotta go, I've got a meeting.
OK. - Are you gonna be all right?
Yeah. - OK.
see you again. - You take care.
who are you?
don't matter.
it's my photograph.
who's she?
it's not your business.
she's pretty fit.
is she a model?
what? - I said she's quite fit, is she a model?
no.
so you do things for magazines like pornos and... sex magazines?
No!
I'm only asking.
you should do.
she should get in 'em.
give them to me.
Oi, you lads, cut it out.
we was only messing about. We're best mates.
Yeah, all right, well, just calm down, all right?
Yeah.
get back. Get back, else I'll drop 'em.
give me them back. - No. I just wanted to look.
if you want my watch...
here you are. And bag.
I don't want your bag and watch, mate, I just wanted to look.
I was only messing about.
here.
who's she?
she? Maria.
pretty fit. - She is.
Yeah.
Where's she from?
france, Paris.
so where are you from?
me? - Yeah.
from Poland. - Oi!
what you doing? You know it's private here?
Yeah, we do.
clear off, then, or I'll call the police.
shut up! - I'll get the police. Clear off!
Bye. - Hold on, man. Oi, wait!
Oh, my God, you look big!
Hey, that's enough of that. - Shut up!
I'll remember your face. - Yeah, whatever!
got a photographic memory. - Yeah.
so, what happened to your face?
I got beat up last night by three lads, down there.
they nicked my bag and everything.
where do you live?
erm, everywhere. Anywhere.
just around here.
on the streets too?
Mm.
where do you live?
in there, with my father.
which one do you live in? I'll come and call for you tomorrow.
I show you later.
what, d'you want me to come with you to see your flat or your house?
I don't know. If you want.
yeah?
what, your dad won't mind, will he?
what, he will mind or will he let me?
I don't know.
what's his name?
dad's name? - Yeah.
cool. What's your name?
Oh, I'm Marek.
Tomo. Nice to meet you, mate. - Nice to meet you.
Hey, Graham. - How you doing, Marek?
I'm OK, thank you. - Nice to see you, mate.
who's your sidekick, then?
he's my friend, Tomo. - Tomo. All right, Tomo?
all right. - Where you from, then?
erm, Nottingham. - Up North, eh?
Yeah, well, Midlands.
midlands? What bit of the Midlands is that?
east. East Midlands. - East, oh!
thanks for helping us yesterday. I see you're wearing the shirt. Nice one, son.
what you doing later on this afternoon? D'you wanna earn a fiver?
Yeah.
well, I was asking Marek actually, Tomo, to tell you the truth.
erm, basically, what it is, tomorrow, I want you to sit down on a deckchair, with a big pile of deckchairs by you... - Yeah.
...and when someone comes along and they want to hire a deckchair, you have to stand up, just for a couple of seconds, take the money and sit back down again.
sound easy enough?
Yeah. - Yeah?
can I do it as well?
will you vouch for him? Is he an 'ard worker?
Yeah.
yeah? - I think so.
OK, five pound each. Is that all right, is that a deal?
Yeah, yeah. - There's one little catch.
see this lot of deckchairs we've got 'ere, and these ones lined up over 'ere, we gotta sand them down today, so no one gets splinters.
so, if you wanna pick up the sandpaper and get going on it, son.
so, do we get a fiver for this and a fiver for tomorrow?
that's a tenner. - He's a joker, isn't he?
no, five pound, that's it.
and you gotta prove yourself to me first, d'you understand?
OK. - Yeah? All right, go on.
no, no, no, no, Tomo, not that one, son. Look, one of them over there.
pick one up. You gotta start your own chair, go on. Get a spurt on,
have we gotta do 'em all?
Yeah, all of 'em, yeah. There ain't that many of 'em.
the sooner you get a start on it, the sooner we'll do it.
I know that he's an 'ard worker.
there you go.
Tomo, wake up.
your food.
there ain't a lot there, mate.
there's only a little bit.
I can't give you more.
the rest is for my dad.
how much is your dad having?
eat.
so, erm, why have you got so many pictures of Maria?
is she your girlfriend, or summat?
Yes, she is.
so... have you had sex with her?
no.
only felt the bazookas?
No!
well, obviously, her being your girlfriend, you've kissed her, yeah?
not yet.
look, mate, in England, it's sort of like a tradition for like a... girlfriend to kiss her boyfriend, so, it sounds to me like you're not actually with her, you just like her.
in Poland, we mustn't kiss to be together, and you think only about one thing.
but, mate, we're not in Poland.
this is England and so... it sounds to me like she's not your girlfriend.
so, I'm gonna try and get in there with her, so, when I get with her,
I'm not gonna be that comfortable with you having pictures of my girlfriend, so, d'you wanna give me them now or...
no, door closed. You must go and find another girl.
she's my girlfriend.
and eat fast, I must meet my dad.
why can't I stay here?
you can't stay, you must eat and go out.
where am I gonna go, mate?
I don't know.
so, you're just gonna let me out on the street again?
please, I'm not gonna nick owt.
Tomo, it's me.
wake up.
are you hungry?
eat.
what's that? - Sausage, Polish. Kielbasa.
mate, I can't eat no more foreign food.
Why? - Half my insides are burning.
I need a poo really bad.
it's all the spiciness and that.
I need the toilet.
no, you can't have toilet.
my father is drunk, he will kill you.
mate, it's important.
wait, I have good idea.
I need to go. - Wait!
I give you plastic bag from kitchen.
you do it in, then we throw it in the window.
what, here?
what? - Here?
Yeah.
is there no way I can go to the toilet, please?
no. - What about toilet roll?
only plastic bag. - What about what can I wipe my bum with?
please, mate. - No.
will you get me some toilet roll on the way, then?
wait, I give you plastic bag. Wait.
don't forget toilet roll, please.
wait. OK.
please... hurry up.
don't forget toilet roll. - OK!
she's so fit, man.
she's loads better than she looks on the pictures.
what d'you think she's talking about now?
Oi!
Oi! - What?
I said, what d'you think she's talking about? - I don't know. Probably France.
I'd love to just take her out for a meal, and just be with her and hold her and just eat together and...
maybe she'll feed me and she'll be saying at the end of the night, "Ooh, Thomasy, I love you so much.
I want to feed you grapes and feed you bread and cheese...
shut up. - Hello.
Hi. - How are you today? Hi.
what happened to your face?
I just got into a fight with three lads.
Really? - Yeah.
does it hurt, sweetie?
Nah. - Sure?
Yeah, yeah. If you think that's bad, you should see the state of them.
I dominated all three of 'em. - Just be careful, yeah?
Yeah, cool.
how are you, Marek? - I am fine.
yeah? - Thank you. And you?
I'm fine, thank you. How did your pictures go?
very good. - Yeah?
you have to show them to me sometime. - Of course.
so, do you like photography, arts and writing and things?
Yeah, I do, actually. - Cool, I'm actually a painter myself.
Really? - Yeah, I do everything. I do...glasses, wine bottles...anything.
Really? - You name something, - I'll tell you if I've done it. - Erm, a flower.
Yeah, I've done flowers, I've done fruit, cakes.
I do women sometimes.
I actually did, like... It weren't awesome but it was an OK drawing of the Eiffel Tower.
the Eiffel Tower? - Yeah, yeah.
show it to me. - Yeah, of course I will.
maybe I should do you sometime.
maybe.
definitely. - Do you want something to drink?
lemonade, please. - Lemonade. And you?
I'm gonna stay off the fizzies, I reckon. Can I just have a...a still water, please?
no ice. - OK.
Cheers.
you're not a painter.

No! - I've got loads of paintings, loads!

Mm-hm. - Hm.
of course.
Oh, come on, someone sit down.
we've been sat around for four and a half hours!
Oh, come on, it's getting cold now, - can we not just call it a day? - No, it's not!
can we not just call it a day?
no. - Tomo, shut up, please!
you shut up.
right. So you're saying the guy who dropped it off has definitely gone, he's not here?
Yeah.
so, which way did he go?
that way.
so, he went that way, we'll go that way, yeah?
OK. - So, I'm just gonna go in, cool, natural, and just be myself, and I'll just pick it up and...
just watch and learn, learn from the master.
don't worry about it, I'll pull it off.
shall I go with you, master?
what for?
I can fake heart attack or something like this.
what d'you want to fake an 'eart attack for?
if you just do it the way I'm gonna do it, then it'll...it'll...it'll happen.
it's just... It's just me, I can do everything.
so, just stay there a second, just one minute, back in a minute. Don't move.
I'm just gonna... just get these for...Uncle Ian.
Ian'll get these, these'll get to Ian.
come on, hurry up.
come on.

rupert Bear trousers!
No! What else is in there? I want summat decent.
that's cool.
like businessman.
mate, you're not a businessman.
take it off, it's not a fashion show.
I thought you said the person who dropped the bag off looked like me.
maybe he washes for his grandparents, I don't know.
that's nice. Retro trousers.
there not retro, they're ridiculous!
mate, just get my tracksuit, please.
I'm gonna be stuck in that tracksuit for the rest of my life.
is it dry?
Yeah.
no, it's not, it's soaked!
what the flippin' heck's that? What you done to it?
I don't know, not me.
you've wrecked my clothes, my only bits of clothes!
a pen!
for God's sake!
maybe this one?
mate, it's a dress!
put it in your trousers.
why are you being stupid?
why are you finding this funny that I've got no clothes to wear?
God's sake, grow up!

Oi! - What?
I've chosen some clothes out the bag.

Yeah, it is.

I'll race you down. Come on, quick!
so, d'you think she'll like it all, then?
of course, it's flowers, umbrella and bell, everything.
don't worry.
I just don't want to serve him.
all right, listen, I'll say something, but just, you know, accept the fact, he's a bloody idiot.
Oh, God, talking of idiots.
go on. - I'll see you.
all right, sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow.
see you tomorrow. Let me change the sign for you.
Thanks.

Yeah, yeah, door-to-door service.
but I live really far away.
it doesn't matter. - We don't care.
come on, in.
thank you very much, my darlings.
I feel very honoured.
so, which way? - This way.
OK.
let's go. - Go, go, go!
you boys are crazy.
# Are you a gambler?
# You gonna take a chance on this life?
# Are you a strangler?
# Are you gonna kill it all?
# Are your friends and your lovers, your God-fearing brothers all gone?
# This is this all you got left # And you don't see it lasting that long # Are you a whirlwind?
# Do you suck in everything around you?
# Are you a monster?
# Do you destroy it all?
# Are your friends and your lovers, your God-fearing brothers all gone?
# Is this all you got left # And you don't see it lasting that long?
this is where I live.
Yeah, which one? - With the flowers.
Oh. - Up there.
thank you so much for taking me home, boys.
thank you.
it's been the best day I've had since I've come to London.

so? - What do you mean, so?
this is the middle of the night for me.
so, here, we've brought you some stuff.
what about that? We brought you some clothes.
I don't want none of your stuff!
you woke me up at seven o'clock in the morning to bring me this load of old rubbish. Are you mad?
we brought you some clothes. Do you want to buy 'em?
that's bird's dresses, I don't want that! What would I want that for?

you can sell it all. - Wait a minute.
retro trousers.
you can sell 'em all.
I'll give you a fiver for the suit.
we're selling it all together.

I don't want all of it. All I want is this.
well, you can resell it on the market.
so, how much d'you want for all of it?
twenty-five, twenty quid?

Yeah. - Things to sit on.

so, just let me do all the talking, cos I'm better than you at it.
OK. Hello. - Hello, lads.
Where's Maria?
I'm afraid she isn't in today.
she told us that she was gonna be in.
no, she had to go home.
one of her family's sick or something.
no problem, we go and find her.
no, no, lads, not here home, Paris home.
where? - France.
she didn't tell us.
when did she go? - This morning.
don't worry, there'll be another little bird here next week.
not like Maria.
what about all these things for her?
I...I don't know, I don't care.
do what you want with it.
and remember, I love you both the same.
Yeah, right! What a crock!
it's really annoying that we spent a lot of money on all this food and that.
on the cheese and bread and grapes.
she didn't even have the decency to tell us she was going.
OK, give me a bottle.
you've had loads.
please.
there's only half a bottle left, I've only had like two swigs.
please. - Don't have loads, then.
thank you.
by the way, have you ever drunk... have you ever drunk before?
no. - You've had like two swigs and you're all over the shop. You don't even know what you're saying.
look at you.
what you staring at?
you're out of your head.
why did anything good never happen to me?
Oh, stop crying and don't be big baby.
I'm not crying and I'm not a big baby, am I? It's called love, son.
you don't love her more than me.
well, obviously I do!
you've got long hair and a stupid accent.
you've got stupid clothes.
so? - So.
I can just go nick some from a shop.
you can't change the way you speak.
anyway, let's not fall out over a girl.
how much money have we got?
I don't know. Ten pounds.
that's all.
just a tenner?
OK.
right, then, let's forget about Maria.
get wasted.
- No!
you look like a German!
it's mine!
Yeah! Ah-ha!
let's turn this up a bit.
Whoo!
three, two, one, go!
ha! Ah-ah!
hoo!
he's turned the music off.
Tomo! - Is this your dad?
I think so.
all right, mate?
what?
what? Any chance of a trans...
what?
what?
I don't know who are you. - I'm Tomo.
but, but...
please.
I want, put on your clothes and leave.
Yeah, mate. - At once.
I'll put them on, I'll take myself out.
Hey, out!
please, please! - Out!

Oh!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
hello.
where am I? - Barbados.
cup of tea there.
Oh!
do you remember what 'appened last night?
it's nice, this. Great cooking.
good.
banging headache.
look, why don't you just go home, son?
you're gonna get yourself into all sorts of trouble if you stay down here.
you know that, don't you? - Well, I can't go home and I like it here.
what d'you mean, you can't go 'ome? If it's money,
I'll lend you the money to get 'ome.
it's not money. I've just got nothing to go home to.
what, no 'ome? - No.
no relatives or nothing? - No.
well, look, you can stay 'ere for a bit, right, but you're gonna 'ave to 'elp me out.
I mean, when I say "Jump," you're gonna say "How high?
yeah?
help me out, do whatever I say, whatever I tell you to do.
yeah? - Yeah. Not in like a sexual way or summat.
sex? No! Sexual way? What you talking about?
no, not a sexual way!
OK.
Ohh!
lovely day, isn't it? - Yeah.
Mm. The sun's shining.
look at that station, it's amazing.
it's very huge.
massive.
maybe, like one weekend, we could save up some money.
go... Obviously because we're not even two minutes away from the station, just get on the train and just go, for a weekend.
can you imagine that, just us two?
OK.
if you want, I can ask my dad to get us cheaper tickets.
he works there.
Really?
cool, definitely. It'd be fun, wouldn't it?
it'd just be like a bit of a road trip between me and you.
like, just best mates going to Paris.
see the Eiffel Tower, eat croissants, drink red wine, cheese, bread.
it'd be good.
just see Maria and just have a laugh with her,
Iike we did the other day.
I mean, it wouldn't be hard to find her. I mean, she's a beautiful girl.
Yeah, she is.
Yeah.
and she must be popular in Paris.
so... I just hope she ain't got a boyfriend.
anyway...
I'm gonna get back to the head polishing.
polish.
good old Brasso.
Yeah.
what you gonna do? - I am staying here.
you'll stay here? - Yeah.
all right, then, mate, well, I'll maybe come down in a bit we'll go over to the park or just... - OK.
...just go out for a bit, yeah? All right, I'll see you in a bit, mate.
see you later. - See you later.
# They said the hand of God delivered the blow # But all that I know # It wasn't him that nearly killed you # I let you down, I never carried you home # I left you alone # To fend there for yourself # I see you out sometimes enjoying the square # The mademoiselles # With faces filled with sadness # For all that you gained, you still remember me # When I speak # I'll remember where I'm from # Well, it's a long way back to the Medway # It's a long way back to the school # It's a long way back to the Coliseum # When we had faces too # When we had faces too # Sometimes I go back, but I never stay # Just wasting away # The world that we grew up in # One day you will see me down on the Strand # And when you hear me speak # You'll remember where you're from #

private Miller...
...you've been smoking ltem 9 for seven minutes and 13 seconds.
we're going to ask you several questions.
how do you feel?
well, sir...
...I feel like a...
like a slice of butter...
...melting on top of a big old pile of flapjacks.
Yeah.
okay, Private Miller, when you think of your superiors...
...what emotions do you feel?
okay, Private Miller?
is this normal?
okay, Private...
okay, Private Miller?
private Miller.
answer the question.
this went out, sir.
can you torch me?
we'll send someone in.
holy bejesus!
private Miller, answer the question.
what was the question again, sir?
when you think of your superiors, what emotions do you feel?
you know what problem I have with your fucking little dog-and-pony act you call the military?
here it is. One: Lots of dudes.
where are the boobies?
two: Why are we underground right now, sir?
why can't we be out in the open? Why aren't we in a square right now?
why aren't we talking to people, letting them know ltem 9 exists?
get it out. Shout off the rooftops:
this is great! This is the bee's knees, ltem 9!
private, we need you to be serious.
I'm serious. Your dick, my mouth.
that's inappropriate.
fuck you!
I've seen enough. Shut it down.
bury the hatch. Sell the land. And dispose of him.
this never happened.
dude, what happened to your eye?
hello.
can you guys understand me?
Hey. Hey, where we going? - This is General Brat.
we've reached a final conclusion on ltem 9.
illegal!
Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.
welcome to KRAD.
you know, I think that last caller had some undeniable points.
right now, we're gonna get to the next caller, Dale Denton.
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan. First-time caller.
here's my piece. - All right.
if marijuana is not legal within the next five years...
...I have no faith left in humanity, period.
everyone likes smoking weed.
they have for thousands of years. They're not gonna stop anytime soon.
it makes everything better. Makes food better. Makes music better.
it makes sex feel better, for God's sakes.
it makes shitty movies better, you know?
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?
Yeah.
well, I'm Garth from Global Saviors, and...
what is this? - I'm joking.
you failed to show up for divorce proceedings four times under court order, and you've been served.
Oh, great. Thanks a lot, asshole. - Sorry.
I'm just saying love has no age.
you can't instantly tell me that a man, because he's a certain age...
...can't marry a woman or love a woman.
I'm dating a high-school girl.
you're not maximizing your potential. Think this girl takes you seriously?
no, but if I'm 25 and the girl is 18 years old...
...you know, in society, that might look bad.
Hey, as long as it's consensual. - I think it's consensual.
yo, you been served.
you've been served. You've been served.
you've been served.
Walter Wadska the third.
you here to fix the fax machine?
no, I'm here to tell you you owe MasterCard 4068 bucks.
you've been served by the best. Keep it real.
why don't you get a real job, you fucking cocksucker?
Hey, "Electric Avenue." - I know, right?
take that shit to the next level, eh? - Okay, I will.
Dr. Edgar Terrence? - Yes.
you have repeatedly refused to trim the monkey tree...
...that spills onto your neighbor's property.
and now because of that, you've been served.
you're a jerk.
all this current system is doing...
...is putting money in the hands of criminals...
...and it's making ordinary people like you and me deal with those criminals.
you ever dealt with a drug dealer? It's terrible, it's weird, it's awkward.
they think they're your friend, but they're not.
Dale, I get your point. Thanks for your input. Next caller, please.
I can't come.
what?
why the fuck not, Dale?
I just... Look, I can't come.
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow. It's a bad day for me.
Jesus Christ, Dale. When were you gonna tell me?
my mom has been shopping all day.
Why? - She's already planning on couscous.
I said I might be able to go, so why is she doing that already?
now I look like an asshole. - You are one.
come on, don't say that. I just can't go. I have a job.
fine. - "Fine"?
don't come. I don't care.
then why have you been inviting me? I thought you wanted me to go.
if you don't wanna meet them, I don't want you to.
I want to. I can't. I have a job. I'm sorry. What do you want from me?
I just know they'll like you, that's all.
you're great, and you're funny...
...and you're sexy.
I just want them to see that.
you want them to see that I'm sexy? - Hey, people?
Hi, Mr. Edwards. - Can I help you?
no, I'm good. Thank you, though.
yeah? I see you don't have a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.
I'm with her, actually. - Actually, this is my boyfriend.
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that, but I just heard that.
what's that supposed to mean?
I'm just wondering why you don't date a nice guy your own age.
she's very mature for her age. - Yeah.
Angie, hey. How's it going?
Hey, Clark, how you doing, man? What's up?
I'm good, bro. I'm good.
dude, I wanted to tell you.
you were hilarious today in drama class.
your Jeff Goldblum impression made me pee my pants.
I wish.
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.
last week when we worked out, you forgot your shorts in my car.
Oh, yeah.
here you go. - Thanks.
Yeah, no problem, no problem.
can you hold those? - Yeah.
Yeah. - How's it going, Sporty Spice?
this is my boyfriend, Dale.
Hey, nice to meet you. - You too.
I've heard so much about you. You're real cool.
I mean, you're great. Yeah. - Yeah, awesome.
anyways, yeah, dude, next year. Next year college, man. College.

I know there's tons of guys that are gonna be trying to get on that shit.
Oh, good. - Because I got that... Yeah.

I'll watch her ass for... - He's trying to be nice.
I'll catch you at Home Ec. - Okay.
you guys got Home Ec together too. That's cool.
we got a few classes together. - Nice to meet you.
time to suck today's dick. That's what I'm talking about. See you guys later.
all right, Clark. - Clark's a great guy.
he's totally gonna take care of Angela, man.
he's great. He's a wonderful lab partner. He'll keep an eye on her.
why don't you go fuck yourself, you weird prick?
I'm a teacher. You can't talk to me like that.
I'm not a student, so I can say whatever I want...
...you chimp-fucking little bastard. - Actually...
you've got T-minus 30 seconds to get off school property...
...or I call the liaison officer.
we're leaving. I'm sorry. - Middle finger won't stop the clock.
what a jerk.
what's that guy's problem? Jesus.
I don't... Normally he's... That's really weird.
I'd love to have dinner with you and your parents tomorrow night.
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go. I'll shuffle things around...
Really? - Yeah, I'll be there for sure.
Yeah, I wanna show them you're in good hands. Yeah.
I got nothing to be embarrassed about.
that means so much to me and my parents.
no problem. It's gonna be awesome.
Hello? - Hey, Saul. Mind if I come by?
come on down. - Sweet. Be there.
Hi, Mary. - Hi.
I thought the hurricane season was over.
I thought hurricane season was over.
I'm sorry. Things just got out of hand.
Yeah, that's the way it was with my first husband.
Hello? Hey, man.
what the fuck, man?
I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here?
some guy with a fauxhawk let me in. He was leaving when l...
fucking Kyle. - It might have been Kyle.
asshole. - I'm sorry, man.
what the fuck's the buzzer for anyway?
I don't know. I'm sorry about that. I don't know your protocol yet.
stuff your sorries in a sack. It's not your fault.
okay. - It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.
okay, cool. Thanks, man. Awesome.

satellite radio.

that's home entertainment.
you're very entertained. Oh, wow. You got a cute picture too.
Oh, yeah. Me and my bubbe.
Hey, let me ask you something.
yeah?
do you think you could pull the plug on someone if you needed to?
like, euthanasia?
like, on her?
if I needed to.
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.
I don't know if we should start going down that road.
I could talk all day about euthanasia. Don't get me started.
maybe we should... - We'll save it.
save it for next time. - I'll take that rain check.
business for the businessman.
Yeah, you got my number. - Okay.
brass tacks. - Yes.
just got a shipment of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.
hands down, dopest dope I've ever smoked.
not better than the Blue Oyster. It can't be. I can't handle that.
this is like if that Blue Oyster shit met that Afghan Kush I had...
...and they had a baby.
and meanwhile, that crazy Northern Lights stuff I had...
...and the Super Red Especial Snowflake met and had a baby.
and by some miracle, those two babies met and fucked...
...this would be the shit that they birthed.
Yes. - This is the product of baby fucking.
smell it. - Okay.
smell it. Enjoy.
it's like God's vagina.
what, you wanna bathe in it?
I wanna live in here. - You wanna be it?
my God, I just wanna shove it up my nose, have that smell all day.
that's amazing. - Shove it anywhere you like.
beautiful. What's it called?
pineapple Express. - Pineapple Express.
it's this thing, like, El Nino.
this airflow that comes from Hawaii and Canada.
it gets the dirt, mixes it in with the weed in a special way.
it's very scientific. I won't go into it right now.
but I am the only guy in the whole city that has it.
only 10 bones more for a quarter.
okay, I'll take a quarter.
all right, you're on. - Thank you very much.
let me get my scale.
get it going. Grab the scale. Let's get me out of here.
I thought hurricane season was over.
Oh, crow.
where are you, you little fucker?
what the fuck is this thing?
cross joint. - Yeah.
you ever smoke one of those? - You can smoke this?
Yeah, man. - No.
this is the future.
this is, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering.
it's rumored that M. M. O'Shaughnessy designed the first one.
the guy who designed the Golden Gate Bridge.
my second favorite civil engineer...
...behind Hannskarl Bandel, Madison Square Garden.
what you do is you light all three ends at the same time.
Really? - And then the smoke converges...
...creating a trifecta of joint-smoking power.
this is it, man. This is what your grandchildren are gonna be smoking.
future. The future.
that's amazing. Well, got the weed?
Yeah. - In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.
be careful with that thing, man. Here's the cash, grab the stash.
Alrighty, man, thanks. Have a good one.
don't hurt yourself. Adios.
well, hey, wait a minute, man.
let's smoke this fucking thing.
I really... I can't, man. I gotta...
I can't even light this thing on my own.
I need your help, man.
I'm in. - Come on!
why not? Let's do it. - Come on down!
why not? What do I do?
okay, here's what you do.
you equip yourself. - I'm equipping.
equip me, sir. - Okay.
you are going to light these two ends while I light this end.
okay. - Are you ready?
ready. - Blast off.
I'm gonna do it. - Good. Go for it.
it's better to cough.
it's like...
makes you 10 times more higher than the cross weed and the Pineapple Express.
you're like, totally fucking Gong Show'ed, man.
Oh, fuck.
hang on one second, man.
Oh, you fucker.
who is it?
it's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.
shit.
what's a Gebert?
come on up.
he ain't getting any of that Pineapple Express.
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.
Hey.
so listen, man.
I gotta ask you. So...
listen, man. You've been buying from me for, like, two months, right?
two months. - I gotta ask, man.
what's up with the suit?
I'm a process server. So I have to wear a suit.
wow, you're a servant? Like a butler?
a chauffeur? - No. No. What? No, I'm not...
shine shoes? - I'm a process server.
I like... - In process.
I work for a company that's, like, hired by lawyers to hand out legal documents.
like subpoenas to people who don't want them.
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to make them admit they're themselves...
...so I can serve them the papers.
disguise.
kind of, I guess.
it's a hell of a job. - That's cool, man.
like a day-to-day basis, it's fine. Like today, I, like, sat in my car...
...I smoked, like, 10 doobies...
...and then I went to go visit my girlfriend at lunch.
nice.
what? You sucked on her titties?
no, I just kissed her. I just did that to make it seem cool.
that's cool. Does she like to smoke weed?
a little sometimes. She has a couple...
she's in high school, so as much as any high-school kid.
she's cool as hell, actually.
you'd get along with her. - Really?
Yeah, you know, it only sucks...
...when I go visit her in high school and the guys she goes to school with...
...are strong and handsome and really funny.
like, do good impressions of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.
and, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb, fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.
what? - It really... It sucks for my ego.
fuck Jeff Goldblum, man. - That's what I say.
you know, don't get down on yourself. You got a great girl.
you got a great job where you don't do anything.
you get to smoke weed all day.
I wish I had that.
are you kidd...? You do. You have the easiest job on Earth.
you do smoke weed all day. - That's true.
you didn't think of that.
I do have a good job. - Yeah, you do nothing.
Thanks, man. - No prob.
thank you.
Oh, shit. All right. Business.
got my persona. - Yeah, yeah.
Hey. Put that cross joint out.
he sees that, he'll never get the fuck out of here.
what's up, Chris? - Yo, hey, Saul.
Hey. - How you doing, buddy?
all right, homes. Good.
who's this? - Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.
you got the dough? There you go.
appreciate it. - Nice. Good to meet you, Mark.
do you have any Percocet, please? - Percocet?
what are you talking about? I don't sell that shit.
Chris. - Chris.
you told him I was gonna sell Percocet?
I didn't say anything about Percocet. - What the fuck?
I just wanted a couple Percocets. - Well, I...
you came to the wrong place. Wrong place.
sorry. - Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.
thank... - God.
what the fuck? - Yeah.
fucking lingerer. - Yeah, totally.
lingerer. - Hardcore.
fuck.
bums me out. - Bums me out too.
if there's one quality I hate in a person, it's lingering.
that's right. You and me both. - Yeah, yeah.
so I'm curious. What have those people done that you go and process and service?
I don't know. It's always something different, I guess.
this guy...
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?
Ted Jones? - Yeah, why?
my guy, Red, who I buy from, he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.
Really? - Maybe it's the same guy.
that'd be weird.
it's a pretty normal name, I guess, but...
anyway, I should really get going, man. I gotta go.
duty calls, but it's good to see you. Thanks.
you're gonna smoke and run? Come on, man.
we can go look at some crazy things on the Internet together.
that sounds appealing, but I think I should probably just get going.
Oh, that sucks. - Yeah.
that's cool, man. What are you doing this weekend?
because, you know, my bubbe's got season tickets to the opera...
...and she can't make it, so wanna go see Phantom?
of the Opera? - Yeah.
I can't this weekend, but you know what? Here.
you know... I'll run out of weed in a couple days. I'll come by' hang out.
we'll watch 227 and shit. - Definitely.
cool, man. Well, thanks. Good to see you.
peace, brother. - Okay.
one love.
when you got behind on the mortgage...
...someone finally made you a loan?
Yes, he did.
Yes, he did. What was the interest rate you got?
it was 12 or 13 percent. - That's disgusting.
Hello? - Hello.
Hey, Angie, what's happening?
I just talked to my mom, and they are so excited you're coming for dinner.
like, so excited. And so am I, but we're all really excited.
thank you so much.
no problem. I'm psyched too. It's gonna be awesome.
couscous. The food so nice, they named it twice.
Dale, anyway, I can't wait for next year when this bullshit's over.
Oh, shit. I see the guy I gotta serve. I'll call you back.
fucking cops. Shit.
Jesus.
what an adorable little cop.
weird.
Jesus. Fuck.
what the fuck was that?
Oh, shit.
dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.
Oh, no!
drive, drive. - Who the fuck is that?
I don't know, but I ain't waiting to see.
pineapple Express.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I saw brains and blood!
come on! Come on!
where do I go?
Hello?
saul, it's Dale. Let me in. Let me in.
I just saw some crazy shit. Please. Let me in.
it's Dale Denton. Let me in, man. - Dale?
Yes, Dale. That's what I said. It's Dale. Let me in.
Oh, all right, man. Come on up.
I buzzed it. Open the door when I buzz it.
buzz it in three seconds exactly.
one, two...
did it work? - On three!
I did it on three. On "one, two, three, go"?
just on three.
he fucking killed him. - Hey, I got neighbors.
he fucking killed him.
who killed who? - A cop. A lady and a guy.
a cop, a lady and a guy? That's a massacre. You saw it?
no, it was just a guy.
what happened to the lady? - No. No.
a woman. A policewoman and a guy, another guy, shot another guy...
...an Asian guy, in the window, at fucking Ted's house.
whoa, was the other guy Ted?
I don't know. He was a big, gray-haired man...
...and he had a robe and he shot him.
and his brain flew every... I'm gonna be... I'm gonna throw up.
what?
that was chicken fries. - Sick.
you threw up on my printer.
I did. - Did you break it?
I hope not. - Listen, man.
I think the guy was Ted.
and the Asians are number-two in town...
...so you saw Ted capping the competition.
they saw me seeing them shoot the guy.
what? They saw you?
and you fucking came here?
did they follow you here? - I don't know.
did they follow you here? - I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.
I saw them kill him.
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?
I tossed my roach.
I crashed into two cars. - Yeah.
so they must have heard... They know someone was out there.
they know someone saw. - They know "someone."
they don't know it was you. Right?
I don't... I mean, yeah. I don't know.
Yes. - I hope not.
relax.
just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some of the rarest weed known to mankind.
is it really that rare?
it's, like, the rarest.
it's almost a shame to smoke it.
it's like killing a unicorn with, like, a bomb.
are you the only guy in town who has this?
you're actually the only guy? - Yeah.
my guy Red said he was giving me an exclusive sneak preview.
I'm the only guy you sold it to? The other guys got Snicklefritz?
Yeah. So we're, like, the only guys.
and Red got this from Ted?
Ted's the man.
let's get the fuck out of here! Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!
I threw a roach of this outside of Ted's house.
so what? I throw roaches all over town.
no. He could find the roach and say, "It's Pineapple Express.
saul is the only guy who has Pineapple Express.
he must have seen the murder! Let's kill him!
let's get out of here! - Fuck!
wait! Stop! Get weed! Get the weed!
anything we might need. Snacks, food, Fruit Roll-Ups.
let's get the fuck out of here! - Okay, okay.
red said he'd be here.
them some drugs.
smells like vomit in this house.
want a hit, man? It's still lit.
I'm having dinner with my wife. She can tell.
smell it on my sweater.
for real?
Yeah, for real.
you wanna wear my vest? It smell good.
not my style.
you ain't got no style, motherfucker.
you have reached the voice mailbox of Ted. - Ted, it's Budlofsky.
we're here. Saul's gone. - And Mathe...
and Matheson. - I think he knew we were coming.
they not here, Ted.
Hi, Ted.
okay, what do you know about Ted?
I think he's crazy about murdering.
Jesus, man. Well, how much money do you have?
I have, like, the 75 that you gave me. - That's it?
well, how much do you have? - Three bucks.
what you getting on my case for? I have more than you.
well, that's my 75 technically. So I have $78 and you have nothing.
I don't know. Let's just go... Go to a motel or a hotel and just hide out.
the police were in on it. Could have flagged credit cards. They'll find us.
shit. I wish we could just go nowhere.
okay.
even if he found that roach, how could he know where you are?
heat-seeking missiles.
bloodhounds.
foxes.
barracudas.
I'm kind of flabbergasted when you say things like that. It's weird.
thank you.
not a compliment. Here's the question.
let's say he actually found the roach.
how could he connect the Pineapple Express weed to you?
he can't, man. Only fucking Red knows.
only Red knows, man.
who is Red?
Red's, like, the middleman between, like, Ted and me.
and we're, like, mad fucking tight, man.
one time, he got this girl...
...to give me a hand job, like, within five minutes of meeting her.
it was like, "I don't even know your name, whoa."
that is pretty rad, but, like, let's say Ted calls him and is like:
did you sell the Pineapple Express to anyone?
he'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul." Why wouldn't he?
no. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.
fucking hand job, Dale. Imagine if I gave you a hand job.
why would I wanna do that? - No, I mean if I got you a hand job.
the same rules don't apply to Red. He's a drug dealer.
I'm a drug dealer. Are you saying you don't trust me?
no, that's not at all what I'm... You know what?
you know? Just ignore what I said. Call him. Give him a call.
see what the dealio is.
hello. - Hey, Red, you okay?
Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man. I just stubbed my toe.
be careful, man. Be careful. Wear shoes in the house.
safety. Safety first, then teamwork. Now, listen.
you know that Pineapple Express stuff you gave me?
don't tell anybody that you sold it to me.
I'd never talk to anyone...
...about the stuff that I do with you involving drugs.
all right, cool. Listen, I'm gonna come by.
I gotta lay some shit on you.
there is a fly in the ointment.
shit has hit the fan. The lion will speak.
I'm in the middle of a convo. - No, seriously.
we're gonna be there in half an hour. - Perfect.
no, please. No, no, no. - Let's go over there and chill out.
no, can we go tomorrow? Look, we're already here...
there's somebody else on the phone with him.
who? - I don't know.
he's whispering to another man.
we'll go in the morning. It's better that way.
okay. - Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.
Hey. - So you're coming by tomorrow?
how'd you know that?
heard you whispering to that other guy that you were talking to. Who is that?
right, Dale. Good job. Listen, I can't go in the morning...
...because my bubbe... Gotta change her clocks. Daylight-savings.
is that the bubbe that's on 41 st and River Street?
the one where we played shuffleboard that one time?
you got it. So, listen, we'll be chilling by noon.
noon it is, bromosexual. - Nice.
we should hit up the casino again. It's been a while.
okay, yeah. We'll definitely hit the casino up.
definitely. All right, peace, brother.
where is he? - I don't know.
why'd he mention a casino? - I don't know.
you make me call my good friend, send him into a booby trap.
and lie to him. - Is Saul Asian?
making me a shitty person. - Is he Asian?
he's not Asian. - You're lying.
I'm not lying. I'm not lying. - You're lying.
did you hear slot machines?
man, I don't know where he is. - You tell me where he is.
tell me. In 45 minutes, I gotta go have dinner with my wife.
I got a reservation. - Forty-five?
that's a dinner reservation you gonna miss.
that's a reservation I'll make.
I don't think so. - Because if he doesn't start to...
look, can you do this one solo? - No, I can't do this solo. Are you crazy?
what are you talking about? What? - What, you trying to abandon me?
this is teamwork. This is a partnership. We are in this together.
you want me to stay? - Yes.
fine, I'll stay. - Thank you.
you happy now? - Yes.
there's no way that we could pause for a minute...
...you guys go home...
...and then tomorrow we could just, like, continue?
I should call Angie soon.
make up some bullshit.
I'm cold.
you're cold? Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here.
I run hot.
Really? - Yeah.
you got more body mass. - Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.
thank you. - I don't appreciate that, but it's okay.
I'm gonna call Angie.
space.
Dale, wait. Wait.
the phones. The phones.
you said they were cops, right? - They are, yeah.
I was thinking, maybe they can...
...triangulate these things, man, or, like, trace them.
right? - That's how they got Saddam.
right. - Fuck. You're right, man.
maybe they can even trace them like, when we're not even on them, you know?
maybe if we bury them, the reception will cut off and they won't be able to.
we can tie it to an animal, be a diversion.
we'll never catch an animal.
the squirrel'd be up in a tree, they'd think we were.
no, no, no.
we'll build a hot-air balloon and... - No.
we'll smash them. - Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.
right here. Good thinking. - Good idea. Yes, destroy it.
get it. - Die. Yes.
what the fuck was that? - I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.
what tree? - That one.
why didn't you smash it on a rock like a normal person?
I don't know. How often does somebody smash things? I'm rusty.
did you at least see where it landed?
I don't know. Call it.
call it? With what? My phone has been smashed.
I bet they can't even triangulate those things.
well, you convinced me they can. You were very convincing back there.
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.
do you see it? - See what?
the phone, you idiot.
why are we here? This place is so fucking scary.
at least I had an idea. You didn't, so shut up.
that's not true. I had two ideas. Nowhere and Quiznos.
what? - What was that?
what? - What is that?
what? - I hear something.
what?
I don't know. Do you hear that?
dude, I literally hear nothing.
Oh, fuck!
where are you going? What are you running from? Return to me now!
help me!
tell him to get away from me!
I'm scared of this darkness! I surrender!
go away! Go away! - I'm unarmed!
this isn't funny anymore! - Dale!
fall back! - Save me!
Oh, shit.
car.
open it! Open it! Open the door! Open it!
unlock it. - I can't unlock it.
what are you doing? Watch the upholstery.
go! I saw something! - No! What did you see? Shut up!
shut the fuck... Shut up, man!
I heard something, then I saw something.
you didn't hear anything, man.
well, I saw something.
and you're telling me that guy in the little short shorts...
...broke your nose? - Right.
the BeDazzler guy broke your nose, tough man?
wake up. Get up. Wake up.
how did I get on you?
I wonder.
watch finally broke.
crazy. What time is it?
that can't be right.
it couldn't be 3 in the morning, could it?
it's 3: 00 right now?
holy shit, man!
we were supposed to be at Red's at noon, man. What if he's gone?
what if he don't get any information? - No, it's daylight-savings, so...
so it's only 2: 00. - Oh, no, it went forward an hour.
it's 4 o'-fucking-clock? Fuck me. No, man. That's bad.
shit. We slept for, like, 18 hours.
my bubbe... Man, my bubbe's gonna be so pissed.
shit.
we gotta call Red.
okay. How?
we'll go to a pay phone.
no, I can't. His number is in my phone.
great. Well, do you remember where he lives?
Yeah, I know where he lives.
what are you insinuating? Like, I'm forgetful?
"Insinuating." Good word.
do you know what that means?
I do, believe it or not. - It means, like, "to seem like."
let's roll. I'm done with the woods. Let's go.
come on, let's get the fuck out of here.
okay. Let's go. No. It's not working. The battery's dead.
wait.
what do you mean, it's dead?
what do I mean? I mean the battery's dead. The battery's dead.
what do you mean, the battery's dead?
how can I explain this to you differently?
the battery is dead. It ceased to live.
it's deceased now. The car needs a battery to start, Saul.
how did this happen?
well, we clearly fell asleep with the battery on, and...
Oh, man. To talk radio?
Yes, talk radio. - It's so boring, man.
okay, okay. - The car just committed suicide.
shut up, man. I have an idea now.
we're gonna go.
we'll walk back to the road. We'll hitchhike.
someone will pick us up, take us to Red's.
red will tell us everything's fine, everything will go back to normal.
how does that sound? Good?
that's a good idea. - Keep our heads on.
if we just keep thinking like this, we're fucking gravy.
all right. I'm in. - Let's do it.
can I have my jacket back, please? - Yeah.
thank you. - Thank you.
thanks for taking care of it.
look, it's like my thumb is my cock.
that's not gonna get us a ride, man.
here's good.
thanks for the smooth sailing, Sharid.
you're welcome.
you're sure we can trust this guy? - Yo, Red.
who is it?
it's Bruce. - Bruce? Who the fuck is this?
Saul. What's up? - Who do you think it is?
who's this?
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.
Dale who?
it's best if you don't know my full name.
Dale Denton. Don't worry. He's with me.
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you, bro.
hold on. Let me get this lock, okay? - You better.
get in here. - Coming in.
y'all wanna buy some drugs? - Frisk me.
what's up? What's up? - Get it.
look at that, huh?
what's up, players? - What's up?
I've been up in here trying to get a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.
what's up with the clothes?
we were camping.
camping? - Yeah.
is your lip okay, man?
you been crying? - Oh, my lip.
it's a cold sore.
never had one before, so I started to cry.
I think it's a lot worse than it looks, though.
cold sore? Does that mean fucking herpes?
Yeah. Yes, it does.
fucking sick, man. You know how many joints we've shared?
I know. I'm a disgusting person.
herpes is for life, bro.
I'm gonna try to definitely put some sort of medical ointment on it.
been taking Vicodin. Doesn't really take swelling down.
it's from that time. I told you, man.
you ate that lollipop out of that stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.
out of her vagina. Remember what you did? What did you do?
you ate a box of Nerds out of her butthole.
you fucking said you wouldn't tell. You sowed your own poison, man.
dudes, seriously, we're here for a reason. Just ask him.
chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here. We got a lot of time to hang out.
I'm making a fucking cake. - No shit.
can I have a piece of that?
what are you doing? Don't ask for a piece. - I can't have a piece?
no, you can't. This is private.
do you know what today is?
Tuesday. - This is my cat's birthday today.
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry. You let it out by accident?
no, because he died three months ago, okay?
so now who's the funny guy?
sorry.
today is his birthday...
...and it is a tradition that on his birthday...
...I get up extra early and make him his favorite kind of dessert.
don't worry, bro. Your cat's going to heaven.
Yeah, maybe. Maybe he went to heaven.
he was a little fucker. Could've gone to hell.
what are we talk...? Guys...
ask him. Just ask him, okay?
ask what? Just come straight. What's up?
Yeah, right. - Lay it on him.
we need to know...
we need to know about your source.
Ted. - Ted Jones.
see, Dale, here, is a protest servant.
I'm not. That's not what I am.
he's not that, but he was outside Ted's house...
don't... Look, we don't want to bring you in to what we're in, okay?
you don't want any trouble. We don't wanna give you trouble.
it's probably best you don't know the whole story.
don't think I can handle danger? - What are you talking about?
you can. - I totally can.
and for you to come into my house...
...and not tell secrets because you think you're saving me...
...well, in reality, it just makes you look like a dumb-ass.
look at this. See this?
you see that? There's no hair under here, okay?
what's the significance of that?
it makes me aerodynamic when I fight. I can take danger.
okay, has anyone called asking about Saul or the Pineapple Express?
that's all we need to know.
is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?
it's "uh-uh." - There it is, man.
cleared. Over.
everything's fine. I told you, bro.
we had a wacky night in the woods...
...but we both can put that behind us like adults.
now it's time to get super-duper high.
got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?
"bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.
Yes.
there you go.
why don't you follow his lead and chill out?
I'm chill. I'm chill as a cucumber, man.
you don't seem chill. - More chill than you.
you're more chill than me?
look at what I'm wearing. Kimono. What are you wearing?
suit. - Yeah. Exactly.
I don't know what's up with you, but I don't know if I like you.
well, I don't know if I like you either, man.
well, that's your loss, because I'm a great friend.
I'm gonna use the telefono to call my wife, okay?
give her a call. - I will.
go ahead. - Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.
go ahead. - Sit on my couch...
...my chillastic couch, and chill out.
I'm chilling right here. - Don't listen to what I'm saying.
this is private. This is my wife. - I'm listening.
I'm not trying to be enemies. I don't wanna be.
I wanna be friends. - Well, then good.
I wanna be best friends. - Come here.
shake my fucking hand. - Shake my hand. Okay.
see, we can be friends. - I'm feeling it.
you feel that? We can be best friends. - I'm looking through you, man.
I'm looking through you too...
...and I see I need to paint the spot on the wall behind you.
I'm looking through you. - Transparent.
I see your intentions. - I see your intestines and intentions.
What'd I have for dinner last night? - Cake.
I'll be right back. Make this phone call.
bullshit.

liar. - What are you doing, man?
he's a liar. He's lying to us, man. He's lying to us.
no, he's not.
he knows my name. He's acting weird.
we can't let him phone anyone, man.
freaking out. You're paranoid. Give him the phone.
I do not trust you, sir.
you're paranoid. - He's acting weird.
red, I'm sorry, bro.
Jesus! - Holy cock.
fuck you!
what are you doing, man? He's sorry.
Oh, Jesus.
Herpes!
I don't wanna have to do this.
red, you're crazy, man.
you brought the devil into my house.
we're friends. - I know we are.
that's why it sucks. - Are you on meth again?
Dale, he's hurting me!
toilet.
flush.
what we do in this life echoes in eternity.
true!
he's going for the phone to call Ted!
stay out of here!
red, don't do it!
red! - You assholes.
you ruined my portable phone.
teamwork. - Yes.
you're gonna break the door. Gonna pay for it?

I let go, now just get this goddamn door off of me!

No! No, no, no!
where you going, huh?
where do you think you're going, Mr. Wiggles?
come on. Get back here. - Saul, help me! Help me!
he's punching my bum!
I'm done with this. Let's talk. Let's try words.
use words! No! No! No!
you okay, man?
I'll get you another bong. - It's my cat's birthday.
happy birthday.
all right? - Thank you.
I think there's a package in the mailbox.
this ends now!
Oh, shit.
was that too much?
can't get the edge.
wait. Got it. Got it.
Hey, Dale.
think we're gonna have to kill him? I don't think I'm capable of murder.
I don't think I am either.
maybe we could just convince him to kill himself.
or, just not say anything.
we need to find out everything he knows, okay?
wake up.
Hey, what's up, dudes?
what's up? Tell us everything now.
talk, Red.
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.
trapped.
it's not happening, Red.
okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed the murder. He found your roach.
he sent two guys over here, Budlofsky and Matheson.
two real big son of a bitches.
they're basically out to kill you guys.
they're gonna kill me too, unless I turn y'all over.
so you guys are basically fucked.
how many cops does he have on his payroll? Tell us.
well, there's the woman cop, Carol. - That's the lady cop.
I don't know. He could have a bunch. This dude is super well-connected.
and he has a really awesome hideout too. It's pretty badass.
Oh, shit. - What else?
he's at a war right now with the Asians.
they're in a drug war right now.
Asians? What Asians? Indians are technically Asian.
it's true. - What Asians?
I don't know. What? Chinese? Or Korean or...
Vietcong?
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.
like, the Asians with the guns and the drugs, and not his friends.
ding-dong. - Hey, Red!
Oh, shit. - Oh, they're here.
they're here to kill me.
okay, I know I sold y'all out. I've been a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.
saul, I'm talking to you. Dale, you're a new friend.
I can make it up. I forgot, bro's before ho's.
just go out the back porch. I won't say anything.
I'll cover for you. - Thanks.
no sweat.
it was Dale Denton. Dale Denton and Saul.
they're on the back porch. You can catch them if you hurry. Go.
Hey. In here.
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.
we should hide. - Why?
if Red tells Ted's guys about my name...
...then they'll go to my apartment.
there, I have Angie's name. They'll put that together, find her. Let's go.
no. I think we should stay.
Why? - I'm in the dumpster already.
well, then, get out. Come on, you're already dirty.
they're gone. - Well, find out what he knows.
red, it's your last chance, man.
you gonna give us something we can use?
matheson, you gotta be kidding me. I mean, what more do you want?
I told you that the guy's name is Dale Denton.
he's obviously working with Saul.
they came in here, busted my house to shit.
they kicked the hell out of me...
...duct-taped me to my grandfather's wheelchair.
what more do you want? Want me to read your horoscope?
you hear that, Ted? - Ask if either of them were Asian.
what skin color were they? - They were white people.
Denton might've been a Jew. I don't know.
I don't judge people based on things like that.
obviously. We're friends.
Ted, you hear him?
Dale Denton: Not Asian. All right. Kill Red.
listen, I would appreciate it if both y'all would take your shoes off.
this is brand-new carpet. You're tracking mud in here.
matheson, you got British Knights on.
I ain't seen anybody wear them since 1987.
what the hell are you doing?
Ted told me to kill him.
well, how about a little fucking discretion here?
see? See? See, right there. You see that?
you catch it? - See what?
you used to not give a fuck about discretion.
I seen you pull somebody's jawbone off. I seen it.
you was ruthless.
you was ruthless, man.
what the fuck, man? You shot me in my stomach.
I'm gonna die now probably.
I had you all over here for dinner. Fish tacos.
this how you do me?
so, what did Budlofsky and Matheson say?
I don't know.
there's this guy, Saul...
...something, selling weed who works with some guy, Dale Denton.
that's all he got out of him.
do you think he has anything to do with the guy that we shot?
well, did he say anything else?
saul mentioned something about "going to the casino."
weird. - "Going to the casino"?
the Asians own the casino, Ted.
I need another beer. - He's gotta be working for them.
maybe after we popped that guy, they hired this outside guy, Dale...
what's his name? Denton? - To finish the job.
maybe.
maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.
I'll have everything there is to know about this Dale Denton guy.
who he's screwing, who's his mother, everything.
I have to take a shit.
wait. Where are we going?
I gotta... I gotta get to Angie's. I have to make sure she's okay.
what about my bubbe? Don't think they'll go after her.
I mean, she has a different last name.
Belogus.
I don't know. We should get out of the middle of the road. Come on.
you guys can wait as long as you want...
...but one minute from right now, I'm gonna eat some food.
and you can call it rude. You can call it whatever you want.
you can be polite with your clean plates, but I'm gonna be eating food.
dad, he'll be here.
I'm going in the other room and eat it, check my e-mail. I'm done.
honey, we're at the table. No one's going to leave the table.
okay. This is it. - All right. Let's do this.
no, no, no. I'm going alone.
no. - Yeah. Yeah.
I wanna meet Angie. - You'll meet her later, man. Look.
look, I need you to stay out here. Keep guard, okay?
it's important. Watch my back. - Okay.
Thanks. - All right. Just be yourself.
I'll keep guard.
Hey.
shit.
Oh, no.
Hey, Dale.
Hello, Dale. - Hey.
dinner.
this is the dinner you invited me to. That was tonight. That's why I'm here.
sit. Please.
of course. Hi.
Hi. - Shannon.
intros. - Great to meet you.
Robert, if I'm not mistaken. - Sit down, so we can eat.
Hi, Dale. - Hey. Okay.
what happened to you? - Nothing.
I'm supposed to be here right now.
so I'm here.
you're all dirty and bleeding. - No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.
you have scratches on your forehead. - Dude, you smell like shit.
Dale, what happened to you? - I was in the woods.
in the woods? - Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...
I was in the woods. - What were you doing?
I bird-watch. I don't.
no, I don't. Look, I'm gonna come clean.
I witnessed a murder, okay?
I saw someone murder someone else...
...and I think they've been following me.
there's a good chance they went to my apartment...
...where Angie has a lot of things.
her yearbooks, report cards, her cell number is written...
...and it's on my fridge.
so they could then find this house. They could come here.
we should call the police right away.
we can't. The police were the murderers.
we can't call the police. They were the murderers.
Angie, I swear to God, you do something or I'm gonna...
so fucked up. - No. Don't let him "gonna."
no, don't wanna. Look, we gotta get the F out of here.
let's go. We need to begin to prematurely evacuate.
are you high? - What? No. I'm not high. Why...?
you are high as a fucking kite.
I'm not high. Let's go.
we're not going anywhere. I'm coming back in a minute.
you know what I'm coming back with? With a gun.
you better be out. I'm not fucking with you.
your gun? His gun?
why do you...? Don't get a gun. Why would he bear arms?
no, we need to go. Everyone, I'm leading the parade.
I just want you to know, I always got your back.
and I'm glad we're partners.
this is so exciting. - Okay, okay.
is this where you're parked? Let's sally forth.
who is after you, after Angie?
they're drug dealers. I have reason to believe that they're drug dealers.
what are you talking about? You're out of your mind.
I know it sounds crazy. - Hide.
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening. I was eating a Fruit Roll...
why'd you do that? - God!
get it! - Jesus! Okay! Just stop!
Angie, what did you do? - He's one of the drug dealers!
he's my pot dealer. - He's your pot dealer?
I got it. - Get it.
gross. Are you okay? - Dale, who is this?
he's my... Oh, shit. Get down. - Dad!
what was that?
that was a gunshot.
stop! Stop it! Stop it!
he's with me. - I'm the good drug dealer.
put the gun down! - Put down the gun.
you assholes do exactly what I say...
...or I will take you outside and fuck you in the street.
no, don't. - Don't fuck us anywhere.
Where's your gun? - I don't need it.
kill motherfuckers with my hands.
get out your goddamn gun. You're making me uncomfortable.
anybody out there?
fucking hide-and-seek.
say, now.
Hey, the food's still warm.
love it.
I found a bloody fork.
it's fucking freaky, man. They could still be here.
did you check the rest of the house?
I'm about to check that bathroom, I know that much.
come on, Saul. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Yes. We made it. We're all safe, guys. We made it.
what are you doing? - Get out.
get out of my car. I can't believe you think it's an option.
okay. Okay. That makes sense. It makes sense.
come on, let's go. It makes sense. He's right.
stay away from my family. Period. - So where do we go? What do we do?
go to the Days Inn downtown, okay?
use a fake name.
Garagely. I'll contact you.
I don't know who these people are, what they're capable of...
...but I will keep you guys safe, I promise that.
fuck off, loser.
Angie, you're a fucking idiot. I say that with love.
okay, you call this Mocha Milkshake.
this one here, English Breeze. Charge $40 for these.
forty? - Yeah.
this one, Da Vinci's Brush. Call this one Bumble Bush.
and this here, Spanish Trampoline.
crazy With them names, ain't you, T?
what the fuck is...? What is it, Spanish...?
spanish Trampoline. Used to call it Spanish Mudflaps...
...but Troy likes to trampoline so Spanish Trampoline.
almost the same number of syllables. - How much?
forty-five for these last three. - All right.
and leave me the best stash. - All right.
it's Pineapple Express. Get your ass up.
Yup' of course.
so get this:
we triangulated the cells.
they smashed one, threw the other in the woods to try to distract us.
it took an hour for Jared to find it.
and then he said that he found Denton's car...
...filled with all these strange disguises.
a powdered wig, a sombrero, leotards.
I mean, what the fuck does that mean?
why don't I just call the Asians and talk to Cheung?
why beat around the bush, you know?
Hello?
Cheung, it's Ted.
record this conversation.
Ted, what a surprise. What can I do for you?
well, Cheung, my friend, let me tell you.
you know, we both know that you sent one of your very skilled hit men over here last night, and I and my colleague...
...made a little decoration on our window. Should have seen it.
we painted the wall with his brain. Painted it.
and now this Dale Denton guy? You serious?
just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're asking for war. Do you want a war?
what? - What?
Hello? - Troy?
dad! Get off the phone. I told you I'm gonna call some hot bitches later...
...and this is the time. - I got you your own line...
...so you would stay off mine. Get off the phone.
don't talk to me like that. I'm not a little kid, I'm a man!
and from this point forward, I'm not taking any of your fucking shit.
I love you, Dad, but the dynamic in our relationship is about to change.
Troy, do me a favor, get oft the fucking phone!
shit. - So you have a son.
sounds like a very nice boy.
all right, you listen to me, Cheung, you motherfucker!
it is on! We're coming at you with everything we got!
it's on, so you better get your head out of your ass...
...and be ready for everything!
you are fucking dead!
you are so dumb.
do you have any idea how weak you just made us look?
goddamn it!
totally sweet.
Ted Jones is slipping.
we shall strike now with full force.
your brother's death will not be in vain.
I gotta say, I've had, like, a lot of weed dealers in my day.
you're the coolest I've ever had. They were all dicks.
Really? Thanks, man. - No problem.
I really appreciate it. That means a lot to me.
it's, like, you're the first guy that I ever sold to that I became friends with.
they say, like, "Don't dip the pen in company ink."
I'm totally glad I dipped in your ink, bro.
Yeah.
we should get out of town. That's probably our next move.
just get on a bus and leave, right?
get bus tickets.
go to the next town. Contact some police.
you know what I was saying? Like, I'm totally...
you're glad you dipped your pen in my ink.
but we should get bus tickets and leave, right?
what?
get on the bus? Leave? Buy bus tickets?
I only have, like, 50 bucks. I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.
what about your sack?
Oh, man, it's fucking killing me. I feel like I popped one.
no. That's unfortunate, but that's not what I'm talking about.
I mean, like, the sack of weed.
couldn't we just, like, sell some weed...
...get some cash and buy bus tickets?
of course, man. That's what I do. - That's what you do. Fucking A.
okay, so you're gonna buy tickets for Saturday's game, right?
these guys are amazing.
what the fuck do you want?
you guys wanna buy some chronic?
what's this stuff called again?
pineapple Express. They said it eight times.
Yeah, but don't call it that. - Yeah, that's not what it's called.
call it Banana Boat. - Make sure you leave it at weed too.
this can be a gateway drug. Don't wanna move on to other things.
cocaine. Don't do that. - We don't fuck around.
don't worry. Don't tell us what to do. - Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.
who the fuck's Chachi?
how much money you guys got? - Come on.
you each get as much as you can grab with one hand.
go easy. That's a big handful, guys. Come on.
keep it on the down-low. - Don't tell anybody where you got it.
you got it from Saul... I mean, you got it from Santiago and Dunbar.
go. Come on. - Go, go. Vamoose!
you fucking did it, man.
you are a good salesman. You got it in you, man.
I'm about to go get some celebratory Slushees.
get some burritos or something.
something to drink too. Something good.
see you, man. Nice.
don't move. Don't you move. This shit hurts.
don't move. What's in your hand?
it's weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.
right here. - I was just smoking...
I thought it was decriminalized, to be honest with you.
I have horrible anorexia, and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.
look, selling narcotics to my students is not decriminalized.
okay. I understand. - I'm the liaison officer for this school.
and guess what? I just saw three students walking from back here...
...with their eyes as red as the devil's dick. You're busted.
on the hood. On the hood. - Okay, okay.
I'm on the hood. Come on.
stand still. Stand still. - I'm still. I'm sorry.
you better hope it's clean. Better hope ain't shit on this record.
I'm gonna put my foot up in your ass.
Oh, big sexy with glasses.
this is Officer Barbara. Requesting an update on fugitive Dale Denton.
I repeat, requesting update on Dale Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.
425, 425, what's your location?
you going down.
what? What do you mean...? Why am I going down?
what did that thing tell you? What are you doing?
what did I tell you? What did I tell you?
I wasn't doing things. Why do you hate me so much?
hit-and-run, Mr. Denton. Hit-and-run.
two parked cars, two nights ago.
one of them was actually a police cruiser.
you gotta be the dumbest motherfucker in captivity.
it's the lady cop. They got Dale. Oh, shit.
so you're telling me you saw Ted Jones...
...and a police officer shoot somebody?
exactly. - And you saw it?
Yes, do you believe me? - Give me a minute.
it was a woman or a man? - It was a policewoman. A woman.
I think I know who that bitch was. - Yes. I will identify that bitch.
thank you so much for believing me, ma'am. Thank you.
I'll tell you, I'll get to the bottom of it.
I'll take this badge off, get to the bottom of it.
I don't work for the law. The law works for me.
I been smelling something in this department.
keep your eyes on the road.
gonna get to the bottom of this shit. - Stop!
son of a bitch!
Oh, no. What the hell was that? What is that?
no, no, no.
no. What are you doing? - I'm saving you, amigo!
freeze, goddamn it! Don't even think about it!
this is an old-fashioned escape mission, buddy.
stop this car!
what the fuck are you doing? - Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit! It's the lady cop! That's the murderer! Go!
that's the lady cop. - Who's that?
I don't know. They're shooting!
Oh, my God, they're shooting!
fuck.
dude!
I can't see! The Slushee!
turn on the wipers! - It's not working!
well, kick out the window!
how do you drive with one foot? - I don't know!
fuck! I think I pulled my groin!
get your foot out of there.
she's gaining on us. She's behind us.
her car's better.
get your leg out of there. Seriously. - I can't.
put it into maximum overdrive!
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, shit!
get it out!
I can't see!
danger! Danger! Trees! Tree, tree! Squirrel!
Hey, I can see through my leg hole.
nice! Look out! Tree, tree, tree!
you did it, man.
all right! Look out!
Oh, shit!
turn around! Turn around!
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.
don't worry. I'm handling this. - Do something.
all right, hold on. I got an idea.
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!
sorry!
what the fuck was that?
fuck. I'm sorry. I thought she'd just go past.
Why? - I don't know.
Oh, my.
Yes! Yes! We made it! All right, man.
let's get the fuck out of here. - No. What are you doing?
you forgot me, you idiot! Come back!
come back! Saul!
sorry, man. - Thank you.
let's go. - Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.
I haven't used a gun since Uam.
Angie, you have exhibited poor decision-making skills.
Oh this is my fault.
and we have hosted violence in our home because of it.
hosted violence? - He's a bad guy.
you don't see that you have stooped way, way below...
I know you years ago lowered expectations with men ...but this guy is so far beneath you. You deserve much better.
open your heart to someone who deserves you.
or don't have a boyfriend at all for a while.
we're stuck in this room. - I love him.
it's not your decision. - Love him?
you don't know What love is. - I'm gonna date him.
we're going to the police. - That's what I said.
I know. - He said not to go to the police.
you should listen. He's a lawyer. - You come with us.
he can't possibly work in law. - I'm not going anywhere.
you stay. - We're leaving.
you stay in the room. - Fine, go. Fine, go.
and we don't need the shampoos. Why did...?
as soon as we kill those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...
...I'm moving on.
okay.
all right.
and I promise you you're gonna be taken care of.
as sure as shit you will.
for now, this is what we're gonna do.
we're gonna go to the farm tonight, we're gonna move tonight's shipment.
then tomorrow morning, we're gonna hunt these guys down.
Dale, Saul, the Asians. Every last one of them.
we're gonna fucking kill them all.
so smile.
shut up.
say something in Spanish. Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.
all right. Are you using protection?
days Inn. - Yes.
may I have the Garagely room, please?
Hello? - Hello, is Angie there?
Dale. - Angie?
my God, are you okay? - I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.
are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.
okay, good. I came up with a plan.
it might sound weird at first, but just listen.
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers... Let me tell you something.
drug dealers are trying to kill me. And you. And my family.
I can't believe I'm in this situation right now because of you...
...and your addiction to marijuana. I cannot believe I'm here.
I can't be addicted to marijuana.
a, I use a bong. It filters out the addictive shit. Seriously.
B, what does that have to do with anything? I witnessed murder.
and now I'm dealing with it.
this, that's happening between us, this is normal.
this happens to every couple dating for three months.
we have to work through it. - No.
this doesn't happen to anyone.
I should not be in this situation, so fuck you.
you know what? It's over.
good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.
Congratulations. Had to happen sometime, right? Why not now?
what the fuck does that mean?
it means that you are gonna go to college next year.
you'll get into Godspeed You! Black Emperor...
...and the fucking Shins.
and you'll blow a bunch of dudes and become a lesbian...
...and I'll be here in fucking Clark County doing shit-all.
you're gonna dump me. So, fuck it, have a good time.
a lesbian? Fuck you, Dale!
you never did like me anyway, did you?
you didn't wanna meet my parents.
I always cared about you. That's not what this is. Okay?
I always care about you.
why don't you ever act like it, huh?
why do you never act like you care about anything?
because I'm high! Fuck! And it... What do you want...? Okay. Jesus.
call me when I can go home.
you lost it playing Bid Whist? You pimp.
no, I'll give you more, but you cannot gamble with it.
I know, I'm sorry about the clocks.
I couldn't remember if it was today or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.
I love you.
you wise-ass.
Hey, you all right, man? That sounded pretty hectic.
I'm okay. Let's just get the fuck out of here.
first things first.
don't do that, okay? - Yeah. Why not?
why not? Car chase, gunshots.
that clearly just happened...
...because we were smoking marijuana.
no, man. It happened because those kids...
...couldn't keep their shit on the down-low.
in case you haven't noticed... Which you haven't.
from what I can tell, you don't notice anything ever.
we are not very functional when we're high. Which is all the time.
well, I don't know, man. I think I'm functioning right now.
I was, like, stoned when I saved you with those Slushees.
what do you gotta say to that?
well, that would be true if you had saved me.
but you didn't save me.
she was gonna help, you made things worse.
we're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit.
don't fucking get on my case, all right?
only reason I started selling pot...
...is so I could put my bubbe in a nice retirement home.
she must be proud of you. - She is proud of me.
I'm gonna become something.
as soon as she dies, I'm gonna become a civil engineer.
I'm gonna design septic tanks for playgrounds.
little kids can take shits.
you idiot. What the hell do you do?
what am I gonna do? Besides stay in my home...
...for fear that you've designed some object I'm around?
I'm gonna be on the radio, talking about life.
giving lessons about life. - Put me in my place.
I'm gonna be designing buildings and what's he doing?
boring people to death on the radio.
you are an asshole. That's all you are. You're an asshole.
I'm not an asshole. - You are an asshole.
I feel pretty sure that I'm not an asshole.
I'm, like, a totally nice guy.
I'm just as nice as you are. So don't bring that out.
in the woods, I gave you my jacket.
you were cold and I clothed you.
how about in the park when I said that you were my friend?
you didn't say anything back.
well, that's easy. It's because we're not friends.
you are my drug dealer.
there's one reason we know each other.
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.
if you didn't sell those drugs, I would have no idea who you were...
...and I would be fantastic right now. Instead of looking like this.
that sounded mean. Just hearing it sounded mean.
I didn't mean to say... - It's out.
monkey's out of the bottle, man.
what? That's not even an expression.
pandora doesn't go back in the box. He only comes out.
I'm sorry, man. Look...
what are you doing? - Here. Have a nice last meal.
come on, man. Don't do that.
why don't you supersize it, bitch?
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.
I didn't mean that.
I love you. Do you love me?
that looks great.
Hello?
Dale?
it is Dale.
Angie, I'm calling because I love you more than anything in the world...
...and I wanna let you know I'll do anything to make it work.
I'll do anything.
I've had a near-death experience, and when that happens...
...you can prioritize your life, and you are it, okay?
so please just take me back, please.
I love you. - I love you.
yeah? - I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.
we were driving away from the house and I just kept thinking...
I don't know. I just...
I wanna marry you.
I made a mistake.
what do you mean? - I've...
what? - I'm just processing that last bit.
you wanna... Oh, fuck. - What?
I don't know.
I realize now that if you would take me back...
...then you are very naive and immature.
you don't see what a fuck-up I am. I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.
you're the one that's immature. - I'm not immature. You're immature.
I am somewhat immature, but you're more immature. I'm older.
just because you're older.
I lost my virginity when I was 14 years old.
Really? - How many girls have you slept with?
like, two and a half. - Two and a half?
what is a half? Your hand?
no, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in. I can't remember why.
I remember thinking, "This doesn't count as a full point."
if I said three, I'd feel like a liar. I was drunk.
screw you.
get me out of this room.
I will, and that's the last you'll ever hear from me, okay?
Oh, thank goodness. Okay.
Belogus. Faye Belogus.
lookit there. Lookit there.
do you use the pool over here?
Yes, I use the pool. Come on, what do you want from me?
your grandson. We need you to get on the phone with your grandson...
what are you talking about, my grandson?
you told me you wanna sit down, play dominos with me.
and now you're hocking me about my grandson.
is that Yiddish? - Yes. Yes, it is.
may I call you Faye?
you can call me Faye, but I'm gonna call you a stinker.
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.
what do you want from me?
bubbe. Hey, guys.
well, look who it is. - Hello, baby.
damn.
Oh, shit.
sorry, Betty.
they kidnapped my grandson.
Yeah, these two guys came in...
...they sat down with me to play dominos.
I never saw them in my life before.
and they kept asking questions about my grandson.
what did they look like? - One of them was very tall and sloppy.
and the other guy, he was very good-looking...
...but he was short as shit.
but the worst part was...
...that my grandson came in, why, and in pajamas.
you gotta find my grandson. - Do the best...
do you promise? - I promise.
Absolutely. You've got something there.
I believe that's a mole, ma'am.
you sack of shit. Do you know what a pain in the ass you've been?
no, man. I don't wanna get out.
who gave you that lollipop? Let's go.
where am I, man? What?
you guys started it, man. I don't even wanna be here.
shit. Did I do that?
Hey, hey. All right, okay.
fuck you, man!
stand back. Ted wants him alive. - Why you holding me back?
Ted wants him alive, okay?
I should be kicking his fucking teeth in.
if anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted. - I look like Hamburglar.
and the Elephant Man.
like someone fucked you up with a coffee pot.
professional. Professional.
professional on this, bitch. - Whatever, man.
where were you? - I was there.
supposed to be my partner. - I was there.
no, you wasn't. How did this happen?
I take the hit? That's how it's gonna be?
fuck all this, you know? Get him out of here.
take him downstairs. Get this asshole out of my sight.
I don't wanna go near this guy.
what's down there? Fucking rancor?
I might act tough...
...but I got a lot of feelings.
and you hurt damn near every one of them.
this ain't over.
you know you gonna die, right? - Yeah.
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.
I hope you enjoy these last 17 minutes of your life...
...because when Ted gets here, he's gonna be like:
kill that motherfucker." I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.
watch your head.
Hey, watch him.
Oh, my God.
el Dorado.
the legends are true.
look at all this weed, man.
what's that? Purple Granddaddy?
come on. - Purple Nurple?
og Kush?
og Kush.
it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
what kind of irrigation...? - Shut up.
can I touch it? - Come here.
Hello?
red?
red? - What the fuck?
get out of here, man. I didn't do shit, Denton.
look, I come in peace, okay? I'm not here to fight you again.
good.
because I'm tired, man. Not feeling so hot.
you don't look great.
they shot me, Denton.
they got me right here.
yeah? - Right here.
and then they got me again right here.
look, man, I'll call 911 right now.
they'll save your life, okay?
you don't need to die. - No, bro.
you don't get it. It doesn't really matter where I'm at.
if I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...
...Ted's gonna find me, man. He will.
and when he does, he's gonna fucking kill me.
he's just, like, an asshole.
I couldn't agree more, Red. That's why I've come here, okay?
you know Ted? He took Saul.
and I'm gonna get him back.
you know, like, he saved my life.
we've been on the run together. He's a great friend. A good guy.
he is. I'll tell you that, man. Saul is a good dude.
I was mean to him, man.
I wronged him and I can't... I can't let it end like that.
I'm just into Buddhism and I'm at peace with the fact...
...that me as this person, probably gonna not be around.
think about a hermit crab, okay?
and it's a shell, and it's like they go from one shell to the next.
and that's what I am. It's like I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.
except, if you're a dick your whole life...
...your next shell will be made of shit, okay?
if you're an asshole, you're gonna come back as a cockroach.
or a worm, or a fucking anal bead, okay?
if you're a man, and you act heroic...
...you'll come back as an eagle.
you'll come back as a dragon.
you'll come back as Jude Law.
okay? Which would you rather be?
maybe the anal bead. Might... Depending on who it belongs to.
it belongs to me.
then the dragon. - Exactly.
you need to help me, okay? Just use it, you know? Use the pain.
you'll have a second wind.
let's get up and go get Saul back. Use it.
aren't you angry at Ted? - Yeah, I'm really mad at him.
what do you wanna do? Don't you wanna get up, do something about it?
maybe that would be cool to do to him.
I don't think "maybe" is the answer I'm looking for
I think, "Yes, I'm gonna help you, Dale..."
...that's the answer I'm looking for.
come here.
Ted Jones messed with the wrong melon farmers.
thug life.
Oh, shit.
just make sure you get those. I don't wanna run them over in the vacuum...
...and shoot my face off, okay? - I'm sorry.
I used to use this little gun when I was a prostitute.
don't.
don't.
just something quick like that.
don't. - Yeah.
don't. You stop it right now. - Stop it.
Oh, God.
that's a big hideout.
I can't do this. I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up. I need medical attention.
what? I thought we just got all pumped up. What was that about?
Ted is a fucking murderer. I can't fuck with him.
I got a wife. She's gonna be out of jail soon.
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna wake up murdered tomorrow.
Oh, man, no. This is lame of you, man.
come on. This could be your moment of redemption.
this could be your moment.
I don't want a moment. I don't want... Fine, go.
fuck you.
please come back for me. Please come back.
legends never die, dude. I'll tell your story.
Carol, she's cool now.
Carol used to be a little crazy, man. She used to throw tickle parties.
sounds like home-cooking to me. - That was fun.
game over, motherfuckers! Everybody freeze!
tell me where my friend is or this guy gets it!
all right, everybody be cool, man. Be cool.
put your guns down. Nobody shoots.
put them down. On the ground.
all right, everybody just chill.
Oh, my God!
you shot him. - Put the gun down.
drop the fucking gun. - Don't shoot me!
holy shit. - I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.
that's right. I shot him. I shot him.
I shot him. I don't have time for a fucking negotiation.
now, I wanna finish this off so I can go home...
...and have dinner with my wife for once.
if anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.
end of story.
I'm telling Ted.
if you do... - He's got a piece.
motherfucker. - Okay, I'm sorry.
he's got another one, in the side.
damn it. I got one more on my leg.
there's one more. I know you'll find it. Take it.
I'm sorry, guys. Sorry I deceived you.
no. Come on.
Oh, great. - Saul.
Dale. - Yes.
what did you do, rat me out? Is that what you did, you bastard?
no, man. - Yes.
I'm here to save you.
no. You just got caught too.
and I'm gonna die in here with some asshole.
okay, you know what? I deserved that.
I'll take that because I have been an asshole, man.
this whole thing is my fault. I ruined your life.
okay? And I know there's no way to make that up to you except by saving your life.
so that's what I came here to do. I'm here to save my best friend.
because that's what you are. You're my best friend.
you're a mean jerk.
I was mean. I was mean because, I think...
I didn't want you to be my best friend.
I didn't wanna think that that's what my life was.
now I realize I'm lucky to have you as my best friend.
you're the best guy I know.
best fucking friends forever, man. Seriously.
all right. Give me a hug. - Yeah. Okay.
Thanks, man. I'm so sorry about everything.
Oh, I'm such a dick.
okay. I'm gonna get us out. - No, you're not, but it's okay.
these guys are gonna fucking kill us. We gotta get out of here.
I know. They are. - Fuck, man.
we can hear you outside and it's very fucking annoying, all right?
okay. Sorry about that, sir. - Shut the fuck up.
do you know what "shut the fuck up" mean?
I do.
shit. Stupid motherfuckers.
Yes. Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea. My belt buckle. My belt buckle.
right here. Okay? Rub your wrists against my belt buckle. That'll do it.
is it working? - I can't feel it.
I can't feel you.
wait, I feel it. - I feel it. Yes, okay.
okay. - Okay. Okay.
I'm gonna save you, man. - Yeah. Yeah.
let me save you. - Save me, Dale.
it's not working. We gotta change angles.
we gotta get more leverage-y. Okay.
okay, that's good. That's good.
get your hands up on it. There we go.
all right. All right. - Yeah. Okay.
Yes. Yes. - Okay.
I'm gonna save you, man. I'm gonna save you.
you're my best friend, man. - Yeah, see?
it's not working. - Let me use my... I'll use my mouth.
finish it off with my mouth, pal. Let's go.
come on. Let's go.
harder.
where are these fuckers? - We got them downstairs.
where did you find them? - Found Saul at his grandmother's.
he fucked up Matheson's face. Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.
it's gross.
Dale Denton comes flying in here like a madman...
...armed to the teeth, and, as you can see, he shot Peter.
plugged him, just whacked him.
now they're both disarmed and they're downstairs.
he shot Pete?
fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.
who the fuck is this Dale Denton?
who is he? Where did he come from? I do not know.
time to cook shit up tonight.
take his stash and burn this motherfucker down.
stop. Wait here.
no retreat, no surrender.
Yes, yes, yes.
wait, someone's coming. - Okay, okay, okay.
if I cough once, I'll take the lead. If I cough twice, you go, okay?
well... I cough sometimes for real.
just don't. Don't...
yo, look. I'm gonna say this one time.
whatever you're doing, I get it, okay?
stop.
see, I don't think you understood me.
I can hear everything you're saying.
one cough mean you go. Two cough mean you take the lead.
the belt buckle. Best friends forever.
y'all fuck on your own time, man.
sorry, man. It was a stupid plan.
what the fuck is that?
Dale!
I've been waiting for this. You burned my face!
I'm gonna tear this ass up.
you shot me.
I'm sorry, man.
I've never been shot. Damn, that hurt.
I got glass in my ass.
Dale. Dale! - This is messed up.

Asians!

prepare to suck the cock of karma!
get down, motherfucker!
come on!

Dale, no!

he got your ear, man. - He got my what?
he got your ear. - Fuck!

help! - My ear.
Yeah. - Help!
you killed my ear. - You shot me.
I didn't do that. - He shot me.
you shot him?
get your hands off of me. - Shut up.
we've had enough out of you.
I'm not your friend.
maybe I can just...
no. No, infected.
is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.
it's clear.
dude. Look.
nice.
bullets.
so seriously, how gross does my ear look?
is it really disgusting or is it, like, kind of cool in a way?
right now it's pretty disgusting.
I feel like I can smell it.
don't worry, bro. Think about Evander Holyfield.
you can't even tell.
that's a good point.
wait.
did you shoot that guy?
no. I'm out of bullets.
me too.
maybe it was ricochet.
gravity.
Oh, nice.
you go down.
I'll cover.
watch my back. I'll go down and take care of this.
sexy motherfucker.
no, no, there might be more bad guys up there.
no, we'll sneak out through the vent. Come on.
I'll boost you up, okay? And then you pull me up.
Oh, nice.

I'm ready. Go.

I'm jumping as high as I can. - Denton!
Dale!
I'll get help. I'll get help.
go ahead and run, you little dipshit. I'll find you.

I'm hungry.
I'm going home.

I knew you were going soft.

well, lookie here. Mr. Folgers. - Oh, man.
what's up, sir?
look, I didn't wanna hit you, man... - Shut the fuck up.
you think you was gonna get me, motherfucker, huh?
you need to sit your little sexy ass down...
...and watch yourself get killed now.
all right.
you know what? This is how it's gonna be?
all right. This is how it ends.
you just got killed by a Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker.
how you like me now, huh?
gross.
red?
Saul.
Hey, Saul. I came back for you, bro.
Yeah. - I remembered, man.
bro's before ho's.
you lied to me. - I did. I lied bigtime to you.
Dale said that you didn't even have herpes and I said that you did.
honestly, like, from now on, from everything that we've gone through...
...and, like, from seeing this asshole's nuts smashed with my Daewoo...
...I wanna be a better friend to you, like I really am.
I fucking love you, dog. Fucking love you.
I wanna be inside you, homes.
no more lies, Red.
this is my moment. - This is your moment.
red!
you know what? I'm feeling it.
red, I'm coming, baby.
your stupidity amazes me.
Hey, Ted!
you killed my brother...
...Caucasian son of cocksucker!

Dale!

Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Saul! Saul!

Saul. Wake up, man, please.
Saul.

Oh, sweet Saul.
Saul.
Yes. Yeah.
saul, you made it.

you saved me. - You came back for me.
Yeah. - Oh, thank you.

what happened?
holy shit.
what's that?
Hi.
red? - Red?
red. - Hey.
red. Where'd you come from, man? Where'd he come from?
he came back to save us.
he saved us? - Yeah.
all right, man.
we all saved each other. - Yeah.
Oh, man. We made it, guys.
we made it. Oh, we made it.
Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP. I am Dale Denton.
the topic of the day: New beginnings. Getting over losses.
friends. Life.
we have our first caller.
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?
Hi. Am I on the air?
you are. You're about to get D'd by the Dale.
a D in the face.
Dale Denton? - Yeah?
you're my hero.
you're my hero.
you are good, man. Seriously.
Thanks. - Gotta admit, you're pretty good.
it sounds pretty good. - It sounds real.
it's not bad, huh? - If I close my eyes, it sounds like...
you are on the radio. - That's the radio. That's a DJ.
if you were on it, I would listen to it. - Thanks, man.
it's like when my bubbe was always playing opera...
...I hated it, but my bubbe loves it.
then it grows on you. It grows on you. Yeah.
it's like Red. I didn't like Red when I first met him.
you didn't like me? - You liked him so much...
...I like you now.
I know this sounds weird, but can we be best friends? Just us, for real?
we should all be best friends. - We should.
seriously. You guys are, like, both of my best friends.
you didn't know it. Now you know it, we'll all be best friends.
know those hearts that break up, "best friends"?
we should get a three-way one.
I don't know if they make those. - We should make the first one.
I want the middle piece, so it'll be crooked on both sides.
I know we've gone over this, but, like, 1000 pardons, 1000 pardons, please.
I fucked up... - I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.
I know I was an asshole. I hope I redeemed myself.
I know me and you had our deal. - We've had some times.
I feel like something's happening here. Is that a boner?
is that a condo? That us moving into an apartment together?
is that us getting a time-share?
you threw an ashtray at his face. - You hit me, man.
at the time, I was like: But it was kind of funny.
you hit me with a DustBuster, man.
I didn't wanna hurt you. It was like, "You better not leave here.
that was such a good fight, man. - That was.
you fuckhead.
the car chase was awesome. - You got into a car chase?
are you kidding me? Oh, my God. - Yeah, it was...
I, like, had my foot through the window.
my groin... I mean, I felt like a wishbone.
I just feel different about everything. - Me too, man. Everything.
like, I never wanna kill anybody else again.
ever. - That's something you pretty much...
you can just kind of dip your toes into.
we kind of dipped our toes into murder.
I killed six guys, I think. How many guys did you...?
we each shot several people. - A lot.
some people get a taste for it, but I don't.
I shot someone who was already dead so that doesn't count as a murder.
apparently you hit him with your car, I'm told.
that... You killed him. - Okay, so I did murder somebody.
you murdered, man. - Not a big deal. That's cool.
that's cool. Whatever. Kill or be killed. - I know.
I'm trying to decide how stoned I am...
...and just how on the verge of death am I now.
am I seeing shit because I'm stoned or because I have no blood left?
you've been shot, like, seven times. - You gotta eat.
you're losing stuff. - Here.
here. - Yeah, okay.
here comes the airplane. - Look, like a baby.
it's a miracle. I think we should all take a moment...
...and think about what a miracle it is that we got out.
and that we became friends in the process...
...and learned some shit about life and stuff.
should we touch each other's hands while we do it? Okay.
I love you guys.
I love you dudes so much.
I'll remember that for the rest of my life.
red? - Red?
yo, Red, man. You alive?
what's up, pal?
Hey. - Hey.
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover who fell asleep at 9.
that's okay. We won't put our dicks in your mouth.
Oh, God. - Hey, there's bubbe.
come on. Let's get out of here.
Yeah, maybe we should go to the doctor.
do you think she'll drive me to the hospital?
me too. I should get the ear looked at.
my ear should probably get professional attention.
it is bad. - That's a bullet burp.
either I'm getting ready to die or I'm gonna take a massive shit.
if somebody could get me to the hospital.
blood from my ear just...
you guys smell like shit.
you are in serious danger.
guess what.
l think l'm parked in the red zone.
now, where were we?
l told you, l don't know anything about any fuckin' setup.
l've been on the force for only eight months.
they don't tell me anything.
nobody tells me shit. You can torture me all you want.
torture you? That's a good idea.
that's a good idea. l like that one, yeah.
even your boss said there wasn't a setup.
my what? -Your boss.
excuse me, pal.
one thing l wanna make clear to you.
l don't have a boss.
nobody tells me what to do. You understand?
you hear what l said, you son of a bitch?
all right, all right, you don't have a boss.
get that fuckin' shit off.
look, l'm not gonna bullshit you, okay?
l don't really give a good fuck...
what you know or don't know...
but l'm gonna torture you anyway...
regardless.
not to get information.
lt's amusing to me to torture a cop.
you can say anything you want...
'cause l've heard it all before.
all you can do is...
pray for a quick death...
which you ain't gonna get.
Oh, God.
you ever listen to K-Billy's " Super Sounds of the '70s " ?
lt's my personal favorite.
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel when they recorded this Dylanesque, pop bubble-gum favorite from April of 1974 that reached up to number five as K-Billy's " Super Sounds of the '70s " continues.
hold still.
hold still, you fuck.
was that good for you too?
Hey, what's goin' on?

don't! Stop!

Yeah, l know.

l don't remember that at all.
l do.
Freddy.
how do l look?
what?
l don't know what to tell you, Marvin.
that fuck.
that sick fuck!
that fuckin' bastard!
Marvin, l need you to hold on.
there's cops waiting to move a block away.
what the fuck are they waiting for?
this fuckin' guy, he slashes my face...
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!
l'm fuckin' deformed!
fuck you!
l'm fuckin' dyin' here!
l'm fuckin' dyin'!
they're not to make a move 'til Joe Cabot shows up.
l was sent in to get him.
all right?
you heard 'em.
they said he's on his way.
don't pussy out on me now, Marvin.
we're just gonna sit here and bleed...
'til Joe Cabot sticks his fucking head through that door.
say hello to a mother-fucker who's inside.
Cabot's doing a job. He wants me on the team.
this better not be a joke.
this ain't a joke.
l'm in. l'm up his ass.
nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants to meet me.
he says l should just wait for a phone call.
after waiting three days, he calls me last night...
and says Joe's ready.
he'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
who picked you up?
nice Guy. We get to a bar. - What bar?
smokey Pete's in Gardena.
we get there...
and l meet Joe and a guy named Mr. White.
phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Mr. Orange? - Mr. Orange.
okay, Mr. Orange.
you ever see him before? - Who? Mr. White?
Yes. Mr. White.
no. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
he's gotta be from out of town.
Joe knows him good. - How can you tell?
the way they talk.
you can tell they're buddies.
you two talk? - Me and Joe?
Mr. White.
a little. - About what?
the Brewers.
milwaukee Brewers?
they won the night before. He made some money off them.
good. lf this crook's a Brewers fan...
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.
and l'll bet they got a sheet in Milwaukee on this Mr. White's ass.
so l want you to go...
through everybody in Milwaukee...
with a history of armed robbery...
and put a name to the face.
nice work, Freddy. - Thank you, my man.
how was Long Beach Mike's referral?
perfect.
his backing me up went a long way.
l told them l played poker with him.
nice Guy checked it out and said it was A-okay.
said l was a good thief, l didn't rattle...
and that l was ready to move.
he's a good guy.
l wouldn't be inside without him.
long Beach Mike is not your friend.
long Beach Mike is a fucking scumbag.
he's selling out his friends.
that's how nice he fuckin' is.
l'll take care of his ass...
but you get that scumbag out of mind...
and take care of business.
gone.
use the commode story?
what's the commode story? lt's a scene. Memorize it.
a what?
undercover cops gotta be Brando.
to do this job you gotta be...
a great actor, naturalistic.
you gotta be naturalistic as hell.
lf you're a bad actor, that's bullshit in this job.
what is this?
that's an amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
l gotta memorize all this?
there's four pages of this shit.
think about it like it's a joke.
memorize what's important. The rest you make your own.
you can tell a joke, can't you?
well, pretend you're Don Rickles...
and tell a joke, all right?
the things you gotta remember are the details.
the details sell your story.
this particular story takes place...
in a men's room.
you gotta know all the details.
whether they got paper towels...
or a blower to dry your hands.
you gotta know...
if the stalls ain't got no doors or not.
you gotta know if they got liquid soap...
or that pink, granulated shit they used in high school.
you gotta know if they got hot water or not.
lf it stinks...
if some nasty, lowlife, scum-ridden mother-fucker...
sprayed diarrhea all over one of the bowls.
you gotta know every detail there is...
to know about this commode.
what you gotta do is take all them details...
and make 'em your own.
while you're doing that...
remember that this story is about you...
and how you perceived the events that went down.
the only way to do that...
is keep sayin' it...
and saying it and saying it.
this is during the L. A. marijuana drought, 1986.
l still had a connection, which was insane 'cause...
you couldn't get any weed anywhere then.
anyway...
l had a connection with this hippie chick in Santa Cruz and all my friends knew it.
they call me and say, " Hey, Freddy. "
and say, " Hey, dude.
you gettin' some?
can you get some for me too? "
they knew l still smoked...
so they asked me to buy some for them.
lt got to be...
every time l bought some weed...
l was buyin' for four or five people.
finally l said, fuck this shit.
l'm makin' this bitch rich.
she didn't even have to meet these people.
l was doing all the work.
that got to be a pain in the ass... people calling all the time.
l couldn't even rent a tape without interruptions.
" when's the next time you're gettin' some? "
Mother-fucker, l'm trying to watch The Lost Boys.
when l get some, l'll call you " .
then these rink-a-dink potheads come by.
they're my friends and everything, but still.
l got it laid out in 60-dollar bags...
they don't want 60 dollars worth.
they want ten dollars' worth...
and breaking it up wasn't easy.
l don't even know...
what ten dollars' worth looks like.
this was a very weird situation.
remember back in '86...
there was a major fuckin' drought.
nobody had anything.
people were livin' on resin...
smokin' the wood in their pipes.
this chick had a bunch...
and she's beggin' me to sell it.
so l told her...
l wasn't gonna be Joe the pot man anymore...
but l would take a little bit...
and sell it to my close friends.
she agreed, we kept the same arrangement as before.
ten percent and free pot for me if l helped her that weekend.
she was sellin' a brick of weed and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.
her brother usually goes with her...
but he's in County unexpectedly.
what for?
his traffc tickets gone to warrant.
they stopped him, found warrants on him...
took him to County.
she doesn't wanna walk around alone with all that weed.
l don't wanna do this.
l have a very bad feeling about it.
she keeps asking me, finally l said okay...
'cause l'm sick of hearing it.
so we go to the train station.
wait. You're goin' to the station with the weed?
the guy needed it right away.
anyway, we get to the train station...
and we're waitin' for the guy.
l'm carryin' the weed in a carry-on bag.
l gotta take a piss...
so l tell her l'm goin' to the boy's room.
so l walk into the men's room...
and who's standing there?
four L. A. County sheriffs and a German shepherd.
they're waitin' for you? -No, they'rejust talkin'.
when l walked in, they all stopped talkin'...
and they looked at me.
that's hard. That's a fuckin' hard situation.
german shepherd starts barking.
he's barkin' at me.
l mean, it's obvious he's barkin' at me.
every nerve ending, all of my senses...
the blood in the veins was screamin':
take off, man. Just bail.
get the fuck outta there.
panic hits me like a bucket of water.
bam! Right in the face.
l'm drenched in panic and these cops...
are lookin' at me and they know it.
they can smell it...
sure as that fuckin' dog can.
they can smell it on me.
shut up.
so anyway...
l got my gun drawn.
l point it at this guy and l tell him...
"Freeze. Don't fucking move."
this little idiot's looking right at me...
and saying " l know. l know. "
but meanwhile...
his right hand is creeping toward the glove box.
l scream at him, " Asshole!
l'm gonna blow you away right now!
put your hands on the dash. "
he's still looking at me, nodding his head.
"l know, buddy, l know."
meanwhile his hand is still going for the glove box.
and l said...
"Buddy, l'm gonna shoot you in the face if you don't put your hands on the dash. "
then this guy's girlfriend...
this real sexy Oriental bitch...
she starts screaming at him: " Chuck, what are you doin'?
listen to the offcer! Put your hands on the dash! "
so then the guy snaps out of it...
and puts his hands on the dash.
what was he goin' for?
his fucking registration.
you're kidding. -No, man!
stupid citizen doesn't know how close he came to getting blown away.
that close, man.
you knew how to handle that situation.
you shit your pants, dive in and swim.
tell me more about Cabot.
l don't know.
he's a cool guy.
he's funny. He's a funny guy.
you remember the Fantastic Four?
Yeah, with that invisible bitch...
and " Flame on " and shit, right?
thing.
mother-fucker...
looks just like the Thing.
Hey! Showtime!
grab your jacket. l'm parked outside.
l'll be right down.
he'll be right down.
don't pussy out on me now.
they don't know.
they don't know shit.
you're not gonna get hurt. You're fuckin' Baretta.
they believe every fuckin' word...
'cause you're super cool.
there goes our boy.
the guy has to have rocks in his head the size of Gibraltar...
to work undercover.
you want one of these? - Yeah, give me the bear claw.
l know what l'm talking about.
black women ain't the same as white women.
there's a slight difference.
very funny. You know what l mean.
what a white bitch will put up with...
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.
lf you cross their line, they fuck you up.
l gotta go along with Pink on that.
okay, Mr. Expert, if this is such a truism...
why is it that every nigger l know...
treats his woman like a piece of shit?
l'll bet those same niggers...
who show their ass in public...
when their bitches get 'em home...
they chill the fuck out.
not these guys. - Oh, yeah. Those guys too.
tell you guys a story.
ln one of Daddy's clubs...
there's a black cocktail waitress named Elois.
Elois? - Yeah, Elois.
E-Lois. We called her Lady E.
where was she from? Compton?
she's from Ladora Heights.
Ladora Heights. The black Beverly Hills.
lt's not the black Beverly Hills.
lt's the black Palos Verdes.
anyway...
lady E...
she was a man-eater-upper. Un-fuckin'-believable.
every guy who ever saw her...
had tojack off to her at least once.
you know who she looked like?
she looked like Christie Love.
remember that TV show Get Christie Love about the black female cop?
she always used to say...
"you're under arrest, sugar!"
who played Christie Love? - Pam Grier.
no, it wasn't Pam Grier. Pam Grier was the other one.
Pam Grier did the film.
christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.
so, who was Christie Love? -How should l know?
great. Now l'm totally fuckin' tortured.
whoever it was...
she looked exactly like Elois.
Anne Francis.
no. That was Honey West.
Anne Francis is white.
l'm tryin' to tell a story here.
she looked exactly like Elois.
we come into the club one night...
and there's Carlos, the bartender.
he's a wetback. He's a friend of mine.
l says to him: "Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"
apparently, Lady E...
was married to real piece of dog shit...
a real animal.
he used to do things to her.
like what? What would he do?
beat her up?
l don't know. He just did things.
so anyway...
one night she plays it real cool.
she waits for him to get drunk.
he falls asleep on the fuckin' couch.
she sneaks up on him...
she puts some glue on his dick...
and glues his dick to his belly.
Jesus Christ!
l'm serious, man. l'm dead serious.
they had to call the paramedics...
to cut the prick loose.
was he all pissed off?
how would you feel if you had to do a fucking handstand to take a piss?
you guys like to tell jokes...
and giggle and kid around, huh?
giggling like a bunch of girls in the schoolyard.
well, let me tell a joke.
five guys sittin' in a bullpen...
San Quentin...
wonderin' how the fuck they got there.
what did we do wrong?
what shouldn't we have done?
lt's your fault, his fault...
all that bullshit.
finally somebody says...
wait a minute.
while we were planning this caper...
we just sat around tellin' fuckin' jokes.
got the message?
l don't mean to holler at ya.
when this caper's over, and l'm sure it'll be successful...
we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands...
l'll laugh with all of you.
find me a different character down there.
right now it's a matter of business.
with the exception of Eddie and myself who you already know...
we're gonna be using aliases on this job.
under no circumstances...
do we want any one of you to relate to each other by your Christian names.
and l don't want any talk about yourself personally.
that includes where you been...
your wife's name...
where you might've done time...
or a bank maybe you robbed in St. Petersburg.
all l want you guys to talk about, if you have to...
