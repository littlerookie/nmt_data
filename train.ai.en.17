Yeah, but this is much, much, much, much better.
Yeah, but this is my fault.
Yeah, but this is my home too. You might need my help.
Yeah, but this is new York, and that isn't exactly a dive bar.
Yeah, but this is not a sandwich.
Yeah, but this is not completely torched.
Yeah, but this is not the input I think of.
Yeah, but this is on a higher level.
Yeah, but this is real.
Yeah, but this is the "hall of fame" section.
Yeah, but this is the Midwest, not California.
Yeah, but this is the beginning of the whole story.
Yeah, but this is the first tree I kissed a boy under.
Yeah, but this is the last job. Alkali, Euro, you're on lookout.
Yeah, but this is the man I saw. He was a doctor there.

Yeah, but this isn't marijuana. I can see that. What is it?
Yeah, but this isn't medium-carbon.
Yeah, but this isn't silly.
Yeah, but this job? It's butt - specific.
Yeah, but this kind of news spreads.
Yeah, but this lady tried to kill me.
Yeah, but this last one is the reason you should probably give me a pay raise.
Yeah, but this letter is three months old. I just didn't throw it away.
Yeah, but this looks okay, right?
Yeah, but this man this alcoholic -
Yeah, but this new one is gonna be a million times better.
Yeah, but this one did, right? No.
Yeah, but this one did.
Yeah, but this one has an elliptical shape.
Yeah, but this one has glitter on it.
Yeah, but this one is serious.
Yeah, but this one really knows his way around a chair.
Yeah, but this one was hand - to - foot.
Yeah, but this one will let me go straight home from the museum instead of having to schlep all the way back to school.
Yeah, but this one's blue.
Yeah, but this one's different.
Yeah, but this one's got a hidden pocket to stash your pot...
Yeah, but this one's legit, okay?
Yeah, but this one's messed up and instant.
Yeah, but this particular spell can make someone think that they love you.
Yeah, but this place has never been compromised,
Yeah, but this place is different.
Yeah, but this place, man.
Yeah, but this proves what I've been talking about.
Yeah, but this response
Yeah, but this riddle is driving me crazy.
Yeah, but this shows just how cautious these guys are.
Yeah, but this thing looks like a bunch of junk
Yeah, but this thing, the synthesizer's a much bigger deal than that.
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.
Yeah, but this time for the advanced one.

Yeah, but those people still get locked up.
Yeah, but those things, amazing things, all that stuff...
Yeah, but those tickets - they weren't your dad's only gift.
Yeah, but those two... I don't know.
Yeah, but those were just booty calls.
Yeah, but those wheels go deep.

Yeah, but to break our code, an enormous amount you'd need to access of information.
Yeah, but to flaunt it like that -
Yeah, but to get out past the NSA firewalls, it would've needed...
Yeah, but to make something that big, you'd need a chemical engineer.
Yeah, but to not think about it means that you are thinking about it.
Yeah, but to sacrifice someone...
Yeah, but to shoot him outside after the fact?
Yeah, but to shoot him outside after the fact? They should have been long gone, no?
Yeah, but to shoot your kid in the back of the head

Yeah, but we are going to have it, Sam, soon.
Yeah, but we are working on the case.
Yeah, but we are.
Yeah, but we aren't all in the same fucking boat.
Yeah, but we aren't giving up that easy.
Yeah, but we both know I did.
Yeah, but we can control it by adapting.
Yeah, but we can feel good about solving the case.
Yeah, but we can feel goodabout solving the case.
Yeah, but we can reconsider.
Yeah, but we can still get, uh, complicated, right?
Yeah, but we can still hold him for another 48 more hours.
Yeah, but we can tease him for a bit longer first, can't we?
Yeah, but we can't enter the audition without a captain.
Yeah, but we can't get into the consulate.
Yeah, but we can't give up, okay? We can't!
Yeah, but we can't go anywhere.
Yeah, but we can't ignore the fact H thateme was bezzling the company.
Yeah, but we can't just choose anybody.
Yeah, but we can't just drop these chips off and leave the poor bastard.
Yeah, but we can't just flip him back.
Yeah, but we can't just stand by and let this happen.
Yeah, but we can't just stand here...
Yeah, but we can't protect them.
Yeah, but we can't prove it,
Yeah, but we can't roll it up the stairs, can we?
Yeah, but we can't rule out firefighters and other first res ponders.
Yeah, but we can't take it back to the future, so what was the point?
Yeah, but we can't talk about it...
Yeah, but we can't wait.
Yeah, but we can't wait. I mean, you got to file today. We don't know what's gonna happen to this kid.
Yeah, but we can't wash the sheets because we're saving water.
Yeah, but we can't leave him out in the open like this at night.
Yeah, but we checked everything.
Yeah, but we checked the Web site and it was a dead end.
Yeah, but we could still have some more romance.
Yeah, but we could still lose him if the water starts to drop.
Yeah, but we couldn't go in together
Yeah, but we decide when the moments pass.
Yeah, but we denied it.
Yeah, but we did everything they told us to.
Yeah, but we did manage to get a lock on the doctor's cell phone.
Yeah, but we did.
Yeah, but we didn't actually start dating until, uh, last month.
Yeah, but we didn't do anything, all right?
Yeah, but we didn't expect this.
Yeah, but we didn't figure he'd come off persuasive,
Yeah, but we didn't find a connection between any of the three products.
Yeah, but we didn't find this body in the morgue.
Yeah, but we didn't give them what they needed.
Yeah, but we didn't have to deal with a strange Frenchman moving into our house.
Yeah, but we didn't like plan on it, you know?
Yeah, but we didn't mean to.
Yeah, but we didn't report it.
Yeah, but we didn't, uh...
Yeah, but we didn't. And now we can't.
Yeah, but we didn't. But he thinks we did.
Yeah, but we do impossible.
Yeah, but we do know that collier thinks he's headed towards a conflict with someone.
Yeah, but we don't do that, because that's illegal.
Yeah, but we don't even have PI coladas.
Yeah, but we don't even have a car seat or a stroller.
Yeah, but we don't even have a name.
Yeah, but we don't even have tickets.
Yeah, but we don't even know if he exists.
Yeah, but we don't get any points for style.
Yeah, but we don't have a movie theater.
Yeah, but we don't have a murder weapon
Yeah, but we don't have a why or a who.
Yeah, but we don't have anything to hit her with.
Yeah, but we don't have it. Where is it?
Yeah, but we don't have the security access codes.
Yeah, but we don't have time to get to both.
Yeah, but we don't have to do this to them.
Yeah, but we don't know anyone who lives around here.
Yeah, but we don't know exactly where it is, so...
Yeah, but we don't know him.
Yeah, but we don't know his name and he's not on our witness list.
Yeah, but we don't know how many there are or who has them...
Yeah, but we don't know that because the box is closed.
Yeah, but we don't know that for sure.
Yeah, but we don't know the truth, do we?
Yeah, but we don't know what he was doing in there.
Yeah, but we don't know what her situation is.
Yeah, but we don't know what that is.
Yeah, but we don't know what that is.
Yeah, but we don't know what we're doing.
Yeah, but we don't know what's be up there
Yeah, but we don't know what's be up there either.
Yeah, but we don't know where she went.
Yeah, but we don't make things up.
Yeah, but we don't need them for this, do we?
Yeah, but we don't need to know where he's going to hit
Yeah, but we don't want to be one of those giant corporate vineyards,
Yeah, but we don't want to say any of that.
Yeah, but we don't work for those organizations. We're doctors.
Yeah, but we don't work off feelings, do we?
Yeah, but we don't.
Yeah, but we figured this would be a great place to start a family of our own.
Yeah, but we forgot the blond weave.
Yeah, but we found the vic in the desert.
Yeah, but we get to see a breast. Right? Yes.
Yeah, but we got a penalty kick coming up.
Yeah, but we got a wedding
Yeah, but we got in that fight on the dock and broke up,
Yeah, but we got it with an illegally - obtained text.
Yeah, but we got nothing to go on.
Yeah, but we got planes to land.
Yeah, but we got this new girl.
Yeah, but we got to talk about this,
Yeah, but we got to you because - what?
Yeah, but we gotta be careful.
Yeah, but we gotta get going.
Yeah, but we gotta get home soon and we just don't have a lot of time.
Yeah, but we gotta think broader strokes here.
Yeah, but we had a problem before your client showed up.
Yeah, but we had different homework assignments.
Yeah, but we had to keep it a secret.
Yeah, but we have below - ground caves near the trailer parks.
Yeah, but we have his money.
Yeah, but we have his money. Just let me ask you this:
Yeah, but we have no context.
Yeah, but we have our ropes.
Yeah, but we have to be careful about burning the gas rations in the middle of winter.
Yeah, but we have to be here, so...
Yeah, but we have to connect it to the smart dust control unit to amplify the pulse.
Yeah, but we have to get it there first.
Yeah, but we have to give it time to work.
Yeah, but we have to have a sleepover
Yeah, but we have to keep him nice and clean, don't we?
Yeah, but we have to meet some Spanish producers first.
Yeah, but we have to prove that in court and we can't.
Yeah, but we have to wait for the priest.
Yeah, but we have to. The trust dissolves in seven years.
Yeah, but we haven't aged at all since then.
Yeah, but we haven't caught Walter yet.
Yeah, but we haven't even gotten to the particulars yet.
Yeah, but we haven't had a storm in months.
Yeah, but we haven't scouted it.
Yeah, but we heard firing. Was anybody hurt?
Yeah, but we heard it too.
Yeah, but we just ate.
Yeah, but we just had a couple of cappuccinos and kept driving.
Yeah, but we just need to keep everybody calm.
Yeah, but we just saw them in the first sketch.
Yeah, but we just say we're busy and now's not a good time, and we float and we float
Yeah, but we just thought how much, you know, Mavis would love it.
Yeah, but we just used that.
Yeah, but we keep it a secret.
Yeah, but we keep it a secret.
Yeah, but we killed it at trial.
Yeah, but we know better.
Yeah, but we know how they feel about the humans.
Yeah, but we know it isn't.
Yeah, but we know it wasn't, so maybe these others
Yeah, but we know it wasn't, so maybe these others aren't as they appear to be, as well.
Yeah, but we know she didn't do it either.
Yeah, but we know she has problems,
Yeah, but we know that Adam Wellingtons company
Yeah, but we know the names of all the main suspects.
Yeah, but we know what money looks like.
Yeah, but we know your history with forgiveness, so that.
Yeah, but we like this house. You'll have your own rooms.
Yeah, but we looked into all the homicides
Yeah, but we lost him.
Yeah, but we need some new blood.
Yeah, but we need something that puts her at the scene very close to the time of the accident.
Yeah, but we need to discuss it sooner rather than later...
Yeah, but we need to... - Okay. We're winning this case.
Yeah, but we never crossed paths.
Yeah, but we never crossed paths. You?
Yeah, but we probably should be worrying about our dreams
Yeah, but we provide the manpower
Yeah, but we really connected.
Yeah, but we really don't know what we're looking for.
Yeah, but we really have to -
Yeah, but we really shouldn't pick this lock.
Yeah, but we really shouldn't pick this lock.
Yeah, but we reconnected.
Yeah, but we reversed positions, so there was no funny business.
Yeah, but we said we'd made a film to show
Yeah, but we say it differently.
Yeah, but we screwed up a lot less than they did,
Yeah, but we should go.
Yeah, but we should probably tay away from those particular words, you know.
Yeah, but we still don't have any I. D.
Yeah, but we still don't know
Yeah, but we still don't know who sent it.
Yeah, but we still got expenses.
Yeah, but we still have to put her at the scene.
Yeah, but we still live in the world.
Yeah, but we still lost.
Yeah, but we still need our tech producer and
Yeah, but we stopped him.
Yeah, but we sure as hell can't see it.
Yeah, but we survived, and we still have each other.
Yeah, but we swept the place last night, and nada.
Yeah, but we talked about it. He's gonna work on treating me more like a woman.
Yeah, but we thought we'd discuss terms
Yeah, but we totally don't.
Yeah, but we were always careful.
Yeah, but we were doing circle magic,
Yeah, but we were still getting to know each other.
Yeah, but we were. I swear. Wizard's honor.
Yeah, but we weren't affected.
Yeah, but we weren't alone. We were with my parents.
Yeah, but we weren't supposed to stay this late.
Yeah, but we weren't...
Yeah, but we won four.
Yeah, but we won the state championship.
Yeah, but we won't know for certain until the analysis...
Yeah, but we would have done that already.
Yeah, but we write notes that are true.
Yeah, but we'd better play it safe. Knock on the door.
Yeah, but we'd prefer you had neither.
Yeah, but we'll be all right.
Yeah, but we'll keep the weight off it for a day or two.
Yeah, but we'll never be our old selves again, Ian, right?
Yeah, but we'll never really know if they bought it.
Yeah, but we'll remodel
Yeah, but we're $43,000 in debt. I was gonna..
Yeah, but we're a whole
Yeah, but we're a whole lot safer with big yellow and his cannons.
Yeah, but we're away then, so, you know...
Yeah, but we're celebrating Christmas tonight, so...
Yeah, but we're changing minds, just like you said. And we'll keep changing them.
Yeah, but we're crossing the line here.
Yeah, but we're football meatheads.
Yeah, but we're free now.
Yeah, but we're going to give them great word of mouth
Yeah, but we're gonna go that way again. Give us the map.
Yeah, but we're gonna use the machine or the device to fix that, right?
Yeah, but we're here. I'm gonna go find the coach.
Yeah, but we're human for a reason.
Yeah, but we're in luck,
Yeah, but we're just here to question some car thieves.
Yeah, but we're keeping you on a short leash.
Yeah, but we're looking for a calculating killer,
Yeah, but we're looking for my brother today.
Yeah, but we're not - I don't want to put a palm tree.
Yeah, but we're not doing anything without the patient's consent.
Yeah, but we're not even close to ready.
Yeah, but we're not even there yet
Yeah, but we're not fighting the same fight.
Yeah, but we're not going for his sake.
Yeah, but we're not gonna find the car.
Yeah, but we're not gonna have any time to go after school.
Yeah, but we're not gonna last that long.
Yeah, but we're not gonna throw more flame on the fire now.
Yeah, but we're not shooting in Singapore.
Yeah, but we're not talking. I'm talking.
Yeah, but we're not thinking it's the wife.
Yeah, but we're not wearing just bras and chicken masks.
Yeah, but we're not.
Yeah, but we're on the same team here. You know, the same... Team.
Yeah, but we're only concerned about one.
Yeah, but we're only ugly on the inside, so it's okay.
Yeah, but we're out of capital. That's bad.
Yeah, but we're out of maple syrup.
Yeah, but we're putting that behind us now.

Yeah, but we're talking about people's emotional lives,
Yeah, but we're talking about prison camps.
Yeah, but we're talking life or death here.
Yeah, but we're, we're kind of off the beaten path.
Yeah, but we've all done that.

Yeah, but we've got a bigger problem here.
Yeah, but we've got the air conditioner cranked.
Yeah, but we've got to finish the album first.

Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say.
Yeah, but, uh, you know,
Yeah, but, uh, you're still here.
Yeah, but, uh...
Yeah, but, um, I can't talk now. Can you come back when my parents are home?

Yeah, but, well, he's probably gonna get killed.
Yeah, but, what if it isn't?
Yeah, but, when I got here, no one was there.
Yeah, but, when is that ever gonna happen?
Yeah, but, why pour it out?
Yeah, but, why'd they call us?

Yeah, but, you know, I was
Yeah, but, you know, I'm getting older...
Yeah, but, you know, I'm pretty sure it's heads.
Yeah, but, you know, hoping can't hurt.

Yeah, but, you know, it was a typo and I ran with it.
Yeah, but, you know, it's a runner,
Yeah, but, you know, it's paid off because look what I can do with the cards.
Yeah, but, you know, knowing all you know now
Yeah, but, you know, maybe I should stay here
Yeah, but, you know, maybe we'll catch you later.
Yeah, but, you know, not personally.

Yeah, but, you know, they're all enormous tools.
Yeah, but, you know, this is kind of more in your wheelhouse.
Yeah, but, you know, time was
Yeah, but, you know, trouble is his egg's empty.
Yeah, but, you know, we could still have fun.
Yeah, but, you know, we could still have fun.
Yeah, but, you know, we're kind of in the middle of something.
Yeah, but, you know, when you hear it
Yeah, but, you know, when you hear it laid out like that, it does sound questionable.
