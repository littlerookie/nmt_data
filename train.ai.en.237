mcleish's horror story came to a happy ending soon after meeting with minor, who corrected the problem and allowed the musician to resume his career.
McLellan said journalists would be better suited by developing skills to fill the information gaps, offering broader perspective and context on the information, and fostering conversation around it.
mclendon then drove off in his mitsubishi car, killed at least three others seemingly at random and injured three police officers who attempted to halt the violence.
mclendon was armed with two high-powered assault rifles, a handgun and a shotgun, and police say he fired more than 200 rounds in the attacks.
McLennan defended his theory in a new edition of primitive marriage studies in ancient history, i876.
McLennan knew only three forms of marriage: polygyny, polyandry and monogamy.
McLennan then goes on toask: whence this custom of exogamy?
McLeod? Yes, he's been in the news a lot recently.

mcluhan came of age at cambridge, the cradle of modern literary criticism, in that groundbreaking moment when the role of readers and the world at large suddenly became matters of interest to literary scholars.
mcluhan challenged the traditional notion that content--whether in print, in film or on television--is automatically more significant than the medium through which it is delivered.
mcluhan drew from many, many sources in order to develop these ideas; the work of canadian political economist and media theorist harold innis was instrumental for him.
mcluhan has elucidated the key role played by mass media in the development of modernity through analyses of the relations between media and individual sensibility as well as the concepts of time and space, implosion and global village.
mcluhan is a name to conjure with.
mcluhan prefigured the internet era in a number of surprising ways.
mcluhan took leavis's methods far beyond literature, though.
