wittgenstein came to study under russell in 1912 and contributed to the theory of logical atomism.
wittgenstein claimed that his ideas had been misunderstood and therefore misrepresented, and the relationship between them never recovered.
wittgenstein later realized that he did not-and if he did not then surely no one else did.
wittgenstein opposes the indoctrination of the religion, criticizing paul, church and religious rites.
wittgenstein regards the procession of refuting the private language as one necessary period of his construction on opinions about "language games" and so on.
