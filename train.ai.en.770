I know. It doesn't make any sense, but right now,
we've got a presidential order to pull you out Of the starkwood compound, along with the perimeter teams.
Tony, larry's been told the president's decision.
he's preparing to move his teams out, but he's got To get you out of there first.
he'll be sending you coordinates for an exfiltration point Along the southwest perimeter.
hold on a second.
Tony, what's going on?
Jack, i might know Why the president called off that air strike.
what do you mean?
I think starkwood's got surface-To-Surface missiles.
that's h they're gonna deploy the bioweapon.
how do you know this?
a fuel truck just pulled up next to the bunker Where they're storing the weapons.
they're pumping rp-7 into an underground depot.
what's rp-7?
it's a propellant only used in surface-To-Surface missiles.
Tony, are you sure?
I'm looking right at it, jack.
do you have any c-4 on you?
Yeah, i've got three charges and a remote detonator.
do you think You can gain access to the underground fuel depot?
Yeah, i think we've got a play,
but i've got to move soon... before that fuel truck pulls away.
okay, i want you to maintain your position. I'm gonna call the president.
come with me.
what is it, tim?
madam president, the joint chiefs Are beginning to question your decision
to call off the air strike against starkwood.
they think the intelligence we received from tony almeida Was sufficient and that we may be missing An opportunity to destroy the bioweapons.
I gave my orders, tim.
no air strike.
no military action of any kind against starkwood.
now, i asked you to handle The joint chiefs; handle them.
I'll do my best, ma'am, But if i may...
what is our next move?
Jonas hodges is coming to the white house.
he wants to speak with me alone.
for what possible reason?
I don't know.
madam president, shouldn't your advisors Be at that meeting?
Tim, stop asking me questions.
if you want to help,
make sure as few people as possible know That jonas hodges is coming here.
and bring him in Through the southeast service entrance.
yes? - madam president, jack bauer And renee walker are calling from fbi.
you did speak to fbi?
Yes, ma'am, five minutes ago.
I gave them your reason for calling off The air strike, but i must warn you,
they were skeptical as well.
be ready for hodges.
Mr. Bauer, Agent walker, this is the president.
madam president, we need to talk.
no, mr. Bauer, we don't.
you need to listen.
I appreciate everything that you have done In gathering this intel,
but i still need more Before i can authorize an air strike.
I'm sorry.
madam president, with all due respect,
I don't believe you're being truthful With us.
excuse me?
I think you called off the air strike Because jonas hodges is in possession Of surface-To-Surface missiles
armed with the bioweapon, And he's threatening to use them
in case you try to take action against him.
madam president, tony almeida witnessed a truck Pumping rp-7 rocket fuel into an underground depot Situated right next to the bunker Where the bioweapons are being stored.
the only purpose for rp-7 rocket fuel
is to launch missiles.
madam president, please just tell us the truth.
Jack, hodges has 13 python missiles Armed with the bioweapons.
three are currently aimed at american cities.
he demanded that i recall the planes, Or he would launch.
what does hodges want?
I don't know...
but he's requested a face-To-Face meeting.
he'll be at the white house in a few minutes.
madam president, the only reason he wants A face-To-Face meeting is to lay out his demands,
and whatever they are, you cannot negotiate with him.
I'm not planning on negotiating with him, jack.
once he places his cards on the table, I am sure that i can...
I can make him realize The futility of what he is trying to do.
Jonas hodges is a traitor and a terrorist,
and after everything that's happened today, Are you really naive enough To believe that you can simply talk to him And change his mind?
I'm not new at this, jack,
and right now, i don't have another option.
dam president, you do.
Tony aeida is still inside starkwood.
I ordered him exfiltrated immediately.
what's he still doing there?
I asked him to stand by until i could talk to you.
he believes he can gain access to the fuel depot
and lay a series of explosive charges And take the missiles out.
now, i believe this can work, but we need to act quickly.
what about the bioweapons?
rp-7 rocket fuel burns at 5, 000 degrees. There will be nothing left.
once the weapons are destroyed, larry moss and his teams Can move in on starkwood and lock it down.
Hodges gave standing orders to his men
to launch the missiles at the first detection Of government interference.
if almeida is detected, Thousands of americans will die, jack.
madam president, i know that there's a risk,
but i would not be asking you to do this
if i didn't think it would work.
please, i am begging you.
trust me.
how long did the doctors Give you to live?
uh, they're not sure,
but the pathogen has started to take effect.
then there's not much i can threaten you with, is there?
I expect you'll do what you think is right.
what the hell does that mean?
she wants us to go in.
but she didn't authorize it.
she can't.
she needs this to be a covert operation.
if something were to go wrong And those missiles were to be launched,
the president needs to be able to swear Under oath that we were working On our own.
she wants us to go in.
notify larry. We need to move fast.
I told you i'd get you to the white house.
I just didn't think t would be Under these conditions.
it was brilliant, you know.
what was that, sir?
what you did to make almeida think That you were betraying me.
quite brilliant. - Thank you, sir.
you put yourself in harm's way, greg,
and i'll never forget that.
I can't believe...
I'm feeling nervous.
you're gonna do fine, sir.
thank you, tim. You're welcome.
so, it sounds to me like the president Didn't actually authorize this.
technically, no. It was more of an... an indirect order,
but believe me, larry, she wants this to happen.
she's gonna meet with hodges, And we're gonna blow those fuel tanks.
Larry, do you have A problem with this?
as a matter of fact, no.
none whatsoever.
these starkwood bastards drew on my men.
I'm looking forward to getting back in there.
all right, have your teams hold their position And be ready to move.
believe me, you'll know when it happens.
all right.
Tony, It's jack. Do you copy? - Yeah, i'm here.
you were right about the missiles. The president confirmed it.
we're gonna have to carry this out As a covert operation.
Larry and his men are standing by to lock down starkwood
as soon as the missiles have been destroyed.
good. - Tony...
I need to know that you can do this Without being detected.
hodges's given his men standing orders to launch those missiles if there's a breach of any kind.
Yeah. I can do it.
okay. Good luck. - Yeah.
we're done here.
I'm going to go run a perimeter check.
you said you just finished one.
I know.
but i don't think we can be too careful right now.
Yeah. - It's me.
auxiliary tanks are fueled and ready.
confirmed.
I'll be down in a few minutes. - Copy that.
Freeze!
let me see your hands.
put your gun on the ground.
slowly.
kick it.
drag him under the truck.
now! Let's go!
hands up.
what do you think you're doing?
you're going to take me down to the fuel tanks.
let's go.
open it up.
??
president will see you now.
very good. Thank you.
Mr. Hodges.
madam president.
this is greg seaton, My associate.
he's a remarkable man. Doesn't look remarkable,
but believe me, he's a genius.
Yes, i know mr. Seaton.
thank you, gentlemen.
it never gets old, does it?
stepping into the... the oval office.
almost Smells of history.
can we sit? - Please.
you know, this is the first time I've been in this room since you were elected?
I'm aware of that, yes.
under your predecessor, I used to drop by every couple of months.
I'd brief president daniels On what was really going on in the world.
and you've been excluded now.
is that what this is about? - No, ma'am.
it's about allowing starkwood To fulfill the purpose for which it was founded:
protecting this country.
you have been attacking This country.
you and general juma Have killed hundreds of innocent people,
including my son.
madam president,
I'm deeply sorry for your loss,
and my heart breaks For all the lives that were taken today,
but i'm shocked That you would think that i had anything To do with it.
we have evidence That you've been working with juma.
your intelligence agencies have failed you.
if i had known what juma was up to, I would have done Everything in my power to stop him.
so let's push aside all these baseless accusations
and maybe we can do some business here.
I'm listening.
madam president,
I know you're a student of history,
and so you're well aware That our nation's independence was won With the aid of private armies,
and we can't survive without them.
look how easy it was to get bioweapons into this country.
our defenses are fragile.
they're on the verge of collapse.
but it's not too late to do something about it.
so what are you suggesting?
in short, I want a seat at the table.
starkwood needs to be involved in the shaping Of military policy, domestic and global.
it sounds more like You want a seat at the head of the table.
madam president, i'm not here to supplant your authority.
what i'm proposing is a partnership.
think of starkwood As the fifth branch of the military.
this contains the protocols that will serve as the basis of our agreement.
I suggest that we review them together.
Jonas, i agreed to this meeting Because i wanted to hear what you had to say.
but what you're proposing is blackmail.
well, that's putting it in the worst possible light.
you are threatening to kill thousands of people.
I'm not proud of this chapter.
I'm the first to admit it.
and it's time to turn the page. This country has seen enough bloodshed today.
for the sake of the american people, madam president,
I implore you to work with me,
and let's move past this.
pick up the document, madam president.
let's go.
come on. Get up now, or i'll leave you down here.
and you don't want that believe me. Get up!
let's go!
what is it?
code 363. That's a government breach.
we're supposed to launch. - Are you sure it's not a false alarm?
no way to tell.
we've got standing Orders, though.
let's start the launch sequence.
too late.
launch sequence complete.
target is locked. - Enter the firing codes.
sir, we need to confirm this.
that's not the correct protocol.
we're about to kill 10, 000 people. We should get someone on the phone.
enter the codes.
now!
no, sir.
that's it. That's us. Let's go.
we're a go!
it's done. - Tony?
Tony, do you copy?
an explosion of that magnitude would have shorted out his com.
we're gonna have to wait for larry and his men to move in.
it says here that you want Active status in the pentagon's strategic planning group.
that's correct.
that would give you access to level 6 classified material.
not even the vice president has that clearance.
these points are nonnegotiable.
I'm not here to debate them.
let's review the next section,
which concerns senate oversight of starkwood field operations.
I'm sorry to interrupt, madam president, but i need To speak with you.
can it wait?
no, ma'am, it can't.
will you excuse me for a moment?
of course.
satcom has just detected A massive explosion on the starkwood compound.
the bioweapons facility Has been destroyed.
are you sure? - Yes, ma'am.
judging by the size of the explosion, Nothing could have survived.
but i don't know how this happened. This wasn't us.
call fbi and have them lock down starkwood.
they're already moving in. - Good.
and when this is over, i want to speak to jack bauer.
Yes, ma'am.
you know...
I'm not sure i'm reaching her.
I think you handled it Perfectly, sir.
we'll see.
what the hell is this?
put this document into evidence, and take these men Into custody.
what are you thinking? Have you lost
what are you thinking? Have you lost Your mind?
Jonas, we've taken out your missiles.
it's over.
that's impossible.
it's the truth.
and you're under arrest.
you are a terrorist and a murderer,
and i'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure
that you pay dearly for your crimes.
sir!
my only crime is that i'm trying to protect My country!
you think this ends with me?
I'm just a small cog in a very big machine.
hold on.
you can't even begin to imagine what you're up against.
what are you talking about?
you'll find out.
get him out of here.
the advanced biohazard team is reporting
no trace of the bioweapon anywhere Near the blast sight.
it was incinerated in the explosion.
good.
any word on tony? - Not yet.
Larry's searching the compound now.
we should hear something soon. - OKAY.
Mr. Bauer, You have a phone call; it's the president.
I'll take it in the conference room. Thank you. I'll be right back.
madam president.
Mr. Bauer, jonas hodges is Under arrest.
that's good news. That's very good.
Jack, you and your team provided me with an option.
and for that, i am deeply grateful.
and so are the american people.
madam president, it was tony almeida Who risked his life to destroy those missiles.
and as you know, he's facing arrest For things he did leading up to today,
and i was hoping that maybe You could...
Yes, mr. Bauer?
um, i'm sorry, i...
completely forgot what i was saying.
you were talking about mr. Almeida.
and my answer is yes, i-I will take his actions into account.
thank you.
what's happening?
I-I-I'm not exactly sure.
Jack, i am so sorry you're going through this.
I wish that there were something i could do.
M-Madam president, i appreciate this phone call.
but i'm sorry. I-I have to go.
of course. - Thank you.
Jonas hodges Has been arrested.
let me know As soon as you got tony. I need to go see dr. Macer.
Yes, madam president?
call ben landry at cdc.
tell him that i want real-Time updates On jack bauer's condition.
Yes, ma'am.
we've secured all entry points and command posts
and are sweeping the compound on a grid-By-Grid basis.
are you meeting any resistance?
no. They're surrendering peacefully and cooperating.
most of the men on this base,
I don't think they had any idea what was going on.
what about almeida?
uh, he's here.
we found him. - Is he okay?
some cuts and bruises, But otherwise, he's in pretty good shape.
good. Good. Jack will be glad to hear that.
listen, renee...
we've known each other a long time, you know.
um, so much stuff has happened today.
Yeah. We have a lot to talk about. I know.
excuse me, agent walker. Your visitor's arrived.
she's in the waiting area. - Okay, thank you.
Larry, i've got to go. Kim bauer's here.
Jack's daughter? - Yes. I-I asked her to come.
there's this experimental treatment For jack's disease, but he needs compatible stem cells.
it's a long shot, but it's the only hope he's got.
okay. Let me know how it goes, all right?
I will. I'm going off com. - All right.
did they say something about kim bauer?
Yeah, she's at fbi Helpin with a treatment for jack,
some, uh, some kind of stem cell therapy.
so they think he's gonna be all right?
didn't sound promising.
listen, tony, this isn't easy for me,
but, uh... i'm under orders To take you into federal custody.
Yeah, i know. - You did a brave thing here.
probably saved thousands of lives.
for the record,
I don't think this is how you should be repaid.
I appreciate that, but, uh...
I'm ready to pay for what i've done.
get the cuffs off him, will you?
chopper's on the way.
I'll be taking you back to fbi, all right?
memory loss is consistent with the disease, Mr. Bauer.
I just wouldn't have expected it To manifest this quickly.
it's not just memory loss.
it feels like...
I don't know exactly how to explain it.
I feel like, uh,
like i'm losing some part of myself.
the disease profile includes Personality changes, sometimes even hallucinations.
but this is a weaponized pathogen We don't know much about.
military's still combing through the remains Of the bioweapons lab in sangala,
so we expect to learn something Very soon.
you were able to give me something That controlled the shaking.
is there anything that you can give me That would help me with this?
no.
I'm sorry.
okay.
thank you. Excuse me.
Jack, is it all right?
Yeah, um,
I'm gonna need to go on record about everything That happened today.
and we need to do it soon.
I'm not sure how much longer i'm gonna be Able to provide you with the details.
okay.
first, there's something that you need to know.
what?
it's about kim. She's here, jack.
I told her that you were sick
and that she might be able to help With the treatment.
you did...
you did what?
come here. Come here.
who the hell Do you think you are?
who the hell Do you think you are?
you think this is easy?
you think you understand what i'm going through?
because you don't. I am dying.
and i was okay with it. I could handle it.
and now you've put in front of me the one thing,
the one thing that is gonna make this unbearable.
Jack, listen... - no, you listen to me.
I specifically told you do not drag my daughter into this.
no one dragged her into anything.
she's been trying to see you all day.
what?
she was at the senate hearing this morning.
she flew out from l. A. To be there,
but we pulled you out before she could see you.
she's been leaving messages at our office all day.
they just didn't get to me till now.
if you want, i can tell her that you're not here.
I can tell her that you can't see her.
can't do that.
where is she?
down the hall.
??
daddy.
how are you feeling?
I'm-I'm okay.
you're not in any pain?
no.
come sit down.
did agent walker tell you that i was trying to find you?
Yeah.
I've tried everything to track you down:
state department, private investigators.
every time i got a phone number or an address, You were already gone.
I'm sorry.
I thought i was doing the best thing for you By staying away.
daddy, i've missed you so much.
I've missed you, Too.
you need to know how sorry i am For everything that you've had to live through because of me.
no, don't do that.
don't put that on yourself.
I'm the one that should apologize. I pushed you away.
and instead of taking responsibility
for all the mistakes i've made in my life, i blamed you.
and it was stupid
and immature.
and now, all the time that we've lost...
agent walker told me that there's a chance
a small chance-- That i could help you,
and you don't want me to.
the treatment is experimental.
and i don't think it's going to work.
and you don't want to because you're afraid to ask me.
no.
there's a risk to you.
a small risk... worth taking.
not to me.
Kim... i'm dying.
and whatever small chance there is To stop that from happening
it is not worth the pain for me to let you Sit there and watch me die.
daddy, i don't want to lose you.
come here.
I don't.
sweetheart, it's going to be all right.
it's gonna be all right. I promise you.
what is it?
what?
sweetheart, i'm sorry...
but you need to go.
please, baby, please, i'm begging you.
I love you so much.

Yes, sir. We're coming up on highway 42.

go!
agent Morgan.
this is everything you got off Chloe O'Brian?
Yeah, there wasn't much.
prepaid from a stolen shipment.
did you check the SIM card numbers from the rest of the shipment?
O'Brian's group might be using other phones from the same batch. We can run a trace.
Yeah, usually we get the local police to track them down.
their procedures can be a little slow.
right. Well, never mind. I've got my own procedures.
Hello?- It's me.
listen, I sent you the SIM number for a mobile phone from a stolen shipment.
I need the numbers from every other phone in the same lot.
no, I've told you before. I won't do this anymore. It's getting too risky.
this is important, Ken. - It's always important.
you'd be in just as much trouble as I would.
you know, I seriously doubt that.
all right, fine.
I'll do it.
but this is the very last time.
you've got 20 minutes.
what is she doing here?
I reinstated her.
just until we get Bauer back.
I'm putting her on this with you.
sir?- And she deserves it.
she's the only one who knew that Bauer was up to something.
well, she wasn't that perceptive when it came to her husband.
look, she might be trying to prove something. That's fine.
but you don't really expect me to be working with her...
I expect you to do your job without questioning my orders.
my God, Chloe! Chloe?
we thought you'd left us.
what happened to you?
um... Chloe, you look terrible.
you okay?
three days?
where in God's name have you been?
locked in a CIA black site.
you what?
um... They grabbed me.
I was making a supply run on my own.
I was careless. I'm sorry.
how badly are we compromised?
I didn't say a word.
so, they just let you go?
I, uh... A guy I used to work with broke me out.
told me to go somewhere safe. I know that sounds crazy.
Yeah, I mean, he broke you out... that's impossible.
not for him.
he's a former head of CTU, Jack Bauer.
Oh... I have to shut it down. We'll have to shut it down. We're moving to another spot.
No! He's my friend. He was trying to protect me.
nobody move!
put your hands where I can see them.
Jack, what are you doing?!
so, you're Adrian Cross.- Yes.
what is this? What's going on?
no need to introduce yourself.
certainly see enough of your name in the files we take.
which one of you is Derek Yates?
I said,"which one of you is Derek Yates?! "
Yates no longer works with us.
we had a clash of styles.
then you're gonna help me find him.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Yeah, I'm afraid you don't have any choice.
we always have a choice, MR. Bauer. That's what this organization represents.
were I to help you, what would happen to my credibility?
your credibility?
I am not gonna ask a third time.
stop! Stop! We will help you.
I promise. I will help you.
why are you looking for Yates?
I need to know what he's doing.
or else I can't begin to find him.
two weeks ago I intercepted intel framing an assassination attempt on president Heller.
it's supposed to take place in London here today.
the only hard name I could pick out was Derek Yates. I tracked it to this organization.
your organization.
you want that on your hands, Chloe?
Yates got greedy.
began selling data to the highest bidder like it was some sort of auction house or something.
also I caught him hacking into military weapon systems.
why?- I really don't know.
I knew it was time for him to go.
I don't do that sort of thing.
take direct action like that.
we don't.
we just acquire information and disseminate it.
nothing more.
you make it sound like what you do is benign.
we both know it isn't. Do we?
get started, Chloe. I don't want to be here any longer than I have to.
Pete, make sure the others have access to the closed- circuit surveillance system from the London transport.
uh, okay, which ones?
all of them. We'll be doing lots of backtracing. We may need to piggyback servers.
chell, pull up your facial recognition program.
we'll use it for the cctv.
we're gonna be scanning for any signs of Derek Yates.
you were my friend.
if you wanted my help, you should've just asked.
Hey, bash.
how long's that junkie bastard Yates here for anyway?
he's paying his way. Don't worry about it.
how about her ladyship? Is he paying for her, too?
I said don't worry about it.
right. I'm working.
you working too much.
do you want me to send you to the other room?
No! Those men scare me.
why can't we go to nice hotel?
those scary men are protecting us, baby.
who from?
speak of the devil. Yeah?
Yeah, hi. Did you get it?
I'm watching it now.
very impressive.
and the Americans had no idea that you were controlling the drone?
no, no, no, no, none.
I monitored their comm traffic for weeks to find the perfect patsy, plant the evidence.
aren't you clever.
so we're still on schedule?
Baby...- I didn't hear what you said.
Yeah, we're on schedule.
even with the modifications I requested?
baby, I don't care to be ignored.
what? Would you shut up?!
Yeah, uh, yeah, it's almost done.
is there someone there with you?
I asked you a question.
no. No, of course not.
it's just, it's the TV.
you haven't told anyone else about this?
about your device?
no.- All right.
I'll be at the arranged place with your money.
but don't keep me waiting.
thank God. Greg, this is crazy. They won't let me talk to my wife.
let's stick to ranks right now, lieutenant.
sit down, please.
you gotta know I didn't do this.
just tell me again what happened.
I was piloting the mq-1 predator, doing recon and surveillance for a convoy outside kandahar.
major Shepherd's convoy.
out of nowhere, the drone suddenly banked to the southwest.
I assumed computer failure, tried to abort.
systems wouldn't respond.
that's when the missiles armed themselves.
missiles don't arm themselves.
that's how it seemed.
it was like someone else had control.
so "someone else" decided to target Shepherd's vehicle...
right after he revoked your weekend pass.
the man about whom you wrote,"I'm gonna put Shepherd down like the bitch he is " .
there's only so much a man can take.
I didn't write that.
we got it off a military posting site you frequent.
dated three weeks ago.
you think I'd be stupid enough to write something like that down?
people say and do a lot of things when they're angry.
come on! You know that's not me!
you really think I'm a murderer?
I know four people are dead.
Where's my flight key?
mps took it.
check the data on it.
it'll have all my keystrokes logged, back up what I'm saying.
it's been checked. And cross-checked with the on board flight recorder.
every command came directly from your console.
you gotta get to grips with this, Chris.
but I can't help you unless you own up to what you did.
you can let the MPS know when you're ready to talk to me.
Greg, the answer has to be on my flight key, okay?
I've been set up. I swear to God!
check it again!
just, please.
they're missing something, I know it.
something that'll clear me!
I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your support on this, Alastair.
I know it hasn't been easy.
well, sitting down with opposition leaders rarely is.
that's why I do it as little as possible.
but your presence here I believe will go a long way towards securing the votes needed for an extension on the lease of your base.
Audrey! MR. prime minister.
I'd like you to meet my daughter, Audrey.
Yes, we know each other of course.
thank you so much for everything you've done for the guest list for this reception.
thank you. I do have to give my staff all the credit.
I'm sorry to interrupt you, but mark needs to have a word with you when you have a moment.
I'm sure the prime minister and I can find plenty of things to talk about until you return.
thank you, Alastair.
sir, we just received word, an American drone fired a missile at one of our own armored vehicles in Afghanistan.
four people were killed.
it appears one of our own pilots is responsible.
two of the dead were British officers.
Oh, my God. By our hand?
Yes, MR. president.
this incident is gonna wipe out the support we needed to maintain our drone base in Diego Garcia.
we have to discuss the implications...- Later.
I think it's important that the prime minister hear this news from me.
hold on. Agent Navarro.
what is it, Navarro?
I've been trying to reach you, sir.
there's been a situation.
Bauer escaped.
what are you talking about? You just apprehended him!
Yes, sir. Which may have been exactly what he wanted.
what?- He broke out another prisoner, an ex-colleague of his.
it appears that Bauer's purpose for being in London was to effect that rescue.
so you're saying he has no designs on president Heller?
from what we know, it appears unlikely.
but you can't be sure.
I mean, for all you know, he may need this colleague to carry out his attack on the president.
I suppose it's possible.
should I alert the brits?
no. We have enough to contend with.
it is on you to reacquire Bauer.
and I'd do it quickly, or you can kiss your career.
Yes, sir.
no, that's not why I'm calling.
when was the last time you saw Yates?
your friend's tattoo.
it's serbian mob. One slash for each murder he's committed.
what the hell have you been doing the past four years?
what have you got on Yates?
nothing on the underground. We're gonna start searching block by block.
work fast.
why are you doing this, Jack?
some fantasy that if you stop the attack, save Heller, all will be forgiven?
you can return back to your daughter and her family?
there's no going back for me.
it's not about that. I told you this is bigger than Heller.
no, you said that for Adrian's benefit.
but I know you, Jack.
for better or worse.
you know Heller.
you know he's a good man.
no, I don't know that.
and you didn't answer my question.
why you?
I owe him. I owe his family.
you mean Audrey.
Audrey and her dad are part of the same system that screwed us both.
at least I'm doing something to fight against it.
how?
by leaking classified information? Military secrets?
people are out there dying in the field, Chloe.
intelligence agencies keep secrets because what they're doing is criminal.
you're smarter than that. I can see you talking, but all I can hear is Adrian Cross.
you don't get to judge me, Jack.
not after what I've been through.
Hey, stosh, look at this.
it's raw footage from an embedded reporter.
what's going on?
it's a friendly fire incident in Afghanistan.
there's a lot of chatter on the military channels.
an American drone attacked an allied military vehicle.
there's four people dead.
pilot's saying he didn't do it.
says someone or something took control of the drone.
they actually believe that? Where was this drone piloted from?
here in the U. K. Lower heyford air force base.
tracked through milstar satellite system?
that's the same system Yates was hacking into.
maybe that's how they plan to attack Heller.
there are easier ways to assassinate a president than hijack a drone.
not if they're trying to make a point.
this attack was in Afghanistan.
maybe it was a dry run.
I think you should talk to someone in the government.
who? No one would listen.
they think I'm a terrorist.
this is our only play. We need to find Yates.
he's in west ealing... Hiding in a council estate.
projects" as you would call it.
you sure?
very good source on this one.
here's the rub.
the bloke who runs the building is a heroin dealer named Aron Bashir.
basher as he's known to his no doubt lovely friends.
anyway, we know he's Yates' supplier and a bit of a nasty piece of work.
the address.
thank you.
you can thank me by leaving and never coming back.
you can't go in there blind.
I can track the tower block's cctv system, but I need to be on site.
I can't ask you to do that.
you're not.
you're gonna need comm support.
get what you need.
let me do this.
I'll get him off our back.
find Yates, and this will be over.
pull up a satellite feed, cover us from there.
and get the van ready.
I'm gonna call the prime minister.
make a formal request to speak to parliament in session.
with all due respect, sir, I-I-I don't think that's a good idea.
you'll be facing a hostile mob.
already, the opposition is intimating that out government is whitewashing the investigation, that certain facts of the incident have been covered up by us.
general.
who was the drone pilot responsible?
lieutenant Chris Tanner.
how long would it take to get him here?- Sir?
I want you to bring him here and allow the royal military police to interrogate him under your supervision.
sir, handing over an American serviceman to foreign jurisdiction is a violation of our status of forces agreement.
please, make the arrangements now.
your protest has been noted.
sir.
this gesture of transparency is not gonna get you the votes you need.
but it may force them to hear what I have to say.
I'm not gonna prepare a speech.
I'm going to apologize from the heart.
make them realize the threat to each and every one of us if we lose this island.
sir, they do things differently in parliament.
they're gonna respond to honesty, mark.
just like the voters during the election.
we were five points down in Ohio when we did that town hall meeting.
you're not addressing a bunch of undecided farmers.
these are practiced legislators who want blood.
eye gonna shout you down, they're gonna call you a liar, they're gonna call you a murderer.
it's brutal.
especially for someone who... who...
who what? Someone who what?
who isn't at the top of their game.
you don't think that I'm up to this?
no, sir, I-I don't.
you didn't think I was up to Ohio, either.
Thanks, Mark.
I just passed general Coburn. He looks really upset. What is going on?
could we have the room, please?
your father wants to talk to parliament.
I told him he'd be walking into a massacre, but he-he won't believe me.
you've got to talk him out of it.
well, if he believes that it will work, maybe we should let him try.
no, you don't understand. They're gonna come at him from all sides.
he will not be able to handle that.
so when you told me not to worry about the slip that he made earlier, were you just...
I meant it.
but you yourself said the pressure can accelerate his decline.
you know how important this is to him.
we... We can prepare him. I'll help you.
we'll do a debate prep session.
all we have to do is get him through this trip.
this was you, yes?
Yep.
you don't feel bad?
those people were already dead.
they just didn't know it.
after today, doomsday clock's set at one minute to.
the whole world's going to hell.
end of the world?
the American president's gonna die on foreign soil.
Ironically... some might say poetically... killed by American drones.
that ain't gonna go unanswered.
dominos are gonna fall, and we're gonna sit it all out in Greenland.
Greenland?
Yeah. Beautiful.
gold, Ruby mines.
an economy that doesn't depend on the subjugation of smaller countries.
it's perfect.
and in about... 28 minutes, when we make the exchange,
I'm gonna be able to afford much more comfortable surroundings than this.
but from what I know about this bitch I'm selling to,
God help me if I don't deliver on time, so just shut up and let me get on with it, okay?
no sign of Bauer yet in our first pass at the search grid.
they found the vehicle he escaped in empty and abandoned.
my source at the met came through.
there are two phones in the stolen shipment that are activated and close to one another.
and you think it might be Bauer and O'Brian.
it's possible.
where are these phones now?
a housing project in west ealing.
look, I can't promise you that Bauer's there, but right now it's as good a lead as we've got.
all right, take a team, check it out.
basher's building is in the middle.
okay.
Jack... Yates isn't gonna be dangerous, but basher and his men are.
got it, thanks.
how long is it gonna take you to access their closed-circuit television?
a couple minutes. I'll let you know as soon as I'm in.
okay, I want to test our comm units.
testing, one, two, three.- Got it.
okay.
I assure you, the United States government will conduct a vigorous and transparent investigation of this incident.
the royal military police will be granted full access to lieutenant Tanner, the individual we believe responsible.
Mr. president.
doesn't this incident call into question your screening procedures, and, in fact, the entire drone program itself?
well, every U. S. combat pilot undergoes a thorough psychological evaluation.
and I am confident in that screening method.
are the families of the murdered soldiers supposed to take comfort in that?
of course not.
what do you say to the children, one as young as five, whose fathers will never come home again?
they deserve an answer to that question, sir.
there's never a good answer for a senseless act.
so you're saying...
but I would help them understand that their loved ones were heroes in the truest sense of the word.
heroes who died fighting to make this country safe.
heroes whose names will remain in my heart forever.
and to the members of this body, I would say, if you withdraw from this fight, the deaths of these three men will serve as nothing more than a call to surrender.
they deserve better.
three men, sir?
you realize there were four men who died in the attack.
four.
who would you like to strike from the casualty list?
none of the Americans, I suppose.
What'd I say, three?- How about captain Olson?
he only had one child and it was just a daughter.
I'm curious, can you, can you name the other British soldier killed in this attack?
you have to consult your notes?
he's not important enough to remember his name?
this man who you will "hold in your heart forever"?
and you can't remember his name?
what's his name?!- Damn it, mark.
I think I have a little work to do.
Mr. president.
lieutenant Wilkins. Married father of three. God...
he needs to know what he'll be up against.
looks like basher's got two in the front, one in the back.
you see anything that could tell us which apartment Yates would be holed up in?
there are ten floors and 200 flats.
he could be in any one of them.
basher would want to keep Yates close to him.
you think you could cut off the feed to the camera in the rear?
Yeah. Someone might notice.
I'm counting on it.
camera's playing up.
Oh, man.
bloody hell! Bash!
what are you all standing there for?
go downstairs and help!
move! Let me know what's going on.
what's all the shouting?
just get back in there and lock yourself in.
move. Now.
I got something.
Jack, fourth floor. Two of them, coming your way.- Copy that.
Jack, it's the second door on the right.
everybody stay calm. I just want to talk.
let him go.
I take it you're Basher.
you're the one who came to talk. What do you want?
you're protecting a man named Derek Yates.
is there any chance he can hear me right now?
Why?
cause I want to make you a deal.
what? For him?
sorry, not really worth it on my end.
no offense, Mick.
not for his life. For yours.
look, I can tell you consider yourself a pretty intimidating group.
you probably think I'm at a disadvantage.
I promise you I'm not.
you give me Derek Yates, and I give you the opportunity to walk out of here without being harmed.
I suggest you take it.
Really?
we're getting out of here!
they're close.
Chloe, you're about to have some company.
there's a convoy heading your way.
are you sure they're for us?
definitely tourists from Langley. Closing fast.
they've been tracking us.
Chloe, you've got to get out.
there.
right there.
you in the van, come out!
last chance!
get out of the vehicle with your hands in the air now!
they can't be far.
have you seen this man in the building?
Yeah, yeah. He's crazy. He's upstairs. He's got a gun.
yates, freeze!
Bauer, put it down, and get on the ground!
drop the weapon now, Bauer!
don't let them go!
put it on the ground!
drop it now!
I'm putting the weapon down!
just stop that couple!
agent Morgan?
please, you got to trust me.
now, you need to tell your men to stop...
he's heading down!
locked down the area! We've got Bauer!
put the weapon down now. Slowly, slowly.
all the way to the ground.
up against the car.
you are chasing the wrong guy.
now, you seem smarter than the rest of them so I'm gonna tell you this once.
I'm trying to prevent an attack on president Heller.
and you are getting in my way.
now, that was a mistake.
Jack, get in!
move over!
we got a man down!
Where'd you get the car?
I stole it.
I hotwired it.
good job.
you're bleeding.
it just grazed me. I'm fine, but Yates got away.
here, I got this from his cpu.
what is it?
design schematics, some kind of multi-channel override system.
there's ten modules. It's drones.
you were right, Jack.
this system can commandeer up to ten U. S drones.
son of a bitch. They're planning a full-scale attack.
all the evidence is here to alert the authorities.
they can decrypt the data.
okay, good.
No! No, no, no, no, no!
what's happening?
Yates embedded a self-destruct program.
it's erasing itself.
can you save it?
Chloe, save it!
couldn't do it.
it was erasing my hard drive.
all I have is the piece of the schematic.
son of a bitch.
okay, Yates was carrying a hard-shell case.
the device must be in there.
we need to pick up his trail now!
Yeah, he could be anywhere.
start with the closed-circuit tvs from the towers.
he was heading South.
damn it!
are we okay?
Yeah, yeah. Looks like it, yeah.
just want to hang here a little while longer.
just to be safe.
what about your work?
it's all done.
just got to find a new buyer.
a new buyer? Why?
guy who chased us, who do you think sent him?
Margot.- How do you know?
well, why pay when you can kill me and get the device for free?
devious bitch.
Oh, baby.
Yeah, but it's all right.
we're still gonna clean up.
plenty of people want to pay for this little baby.
back in a minute.
two more.
Yeah, all right.
you-you are unbelievable.
Oh, but I want you.
now.
geez, you love doing it in public places, don't you?
you are gonna have to actually wait till I finish, baby.
Hi, it's me. I've got the device, but there was a problem.
what?
someone came after us.
an American.
I don't know who he was.
I've never seen him before.
we barely got away.
are you sure you're not being followed?
Yes. But Derek thought you double-crossed him.
started talking about finding another buyer.
so... - You took care of it.
Yes. - That's my girl.
come home as soon as you can.
mommy's waiting.
Almeida
Tony, it's me, Gale is dead
he was suffering so badly
no one should have to go through what he did.
there are children upstairs who are going to die in agony
Michelle, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do for them right now.
actually, there is.
the suicide capsules, for the people down at the hotel.
it's against every regulation in the book.
Yeah.
do it.
get down!
the Saunders" computer file
what server did you store it on?
chase, we got a bomb
how much time?
none.
I got it. Go, go!
chappelle.
Ryan, it's Jack, almost the entire MI6 office has just been wiped out.
what?
one of the things that Saunders was trying to destroy was all the information that MI6 had gathered on him.
I managed to retrieve the hard drive.
have you get anything yet?
I am trying to follow the money trail.
what do you want?
to give you your next assignment.
there is a man named Ryan Chappelle, regional director of CTU.
I want him killed.
it's out of the question.
before you decide, you might want to drop by the Chandler Plaza Hotel, take a good look at what's happening.
then imaging the same event taking place at hundreds of locations all over the country.
you are insane.
the following takes place between 6: 00 A. M. and 7: 00 A. M.
this office isn't above the law.
how can I justify authorizing the murder of an innocent man?
David, we're fighting a war.
Ryan Chappelle is not a civilian.
I still can't order him to be killed.
so what's the alternative?
Yes, David, I know it's extreme.
I realize that, but it's the only move we have here.
look at what's happening right now down at the Chandler Plaza.
this man Saunders has proven that he will use this virus to inflict mass casualties if you don't do what he says.
how long am I supposed to let Saunders dictate my actions?
how long do I allow him to hold this country hostage?
until we catch him.
and if we don't?
we will
but until we do, your only option is to sacrifice Chappelle.
I handed the hard drive from MI6 over to the IT lab.
they are sorting through the data now.
london wants you to debrief them on what went down with MI6.
are we any closer to finding Saunders?
he is using a scrambler phone to contact the President.
Adam says it could take up to 24 hours to trace his location.
is that the only search protocol we have got going?
Saunders transferred money to Amador using a server somewhere in Los Angeles.
I am trying follow Amador's money trail to see if it leads back to Saunders.
but you haven't turned up anything yet
no.
the computer we confiscated from the Go club in Chinatown is a dead end.
I am trying to back trace payments made to Saunders" offshore accounts.
OK, fine.
Jack, the President's office is holding for you.
have them transfer the call down here.
he asked to speak to you in private.
he's on the line at station seven.
excuse me.
this is Bauer.
agent Bauer, please hold for the President.
Mr. President, I have Jack Bauer for you.
Jack
Mr. President
are you alone right now?
Yes, sir.
Saunders called me a few minutes ago. He has made another demand.
what is it?
this is a hard one, Jack.
so I am going to be as direct as I can be.
he wants Ryan Chappelle dead.
I, I am sorry. I don't understand.
he wants his body delivered to the train yard downtown.
why would Saunders want Chappelle dead?
I don't know. He wouldn't give me a reason.
but he was emphatic about the consequences if his demand wasn't met.
Jack,
I feel as though I'm crossing a line that I will never be able to step back from.
so, then you have made your decision. Sir?
unless you can suggest a way to handle this.
what time is this supposed to happen?
0.291666666667
maybe I can find Saunders before then.
that's in less than an hour.
Yes, I know, sir.
I should get going.
Jack.
I am sorry to put this on you, but I didn't know who else to call.
I understand, sir.
I'll get back to you.
Chloe.
what are you doing right now to help find Saunders?
actually, we are relaying our data streams to division.
why are you sending them there?
well, they're the hub now.
chappelle has them gathering information for us.
DOD, MI6
no, forget about that.
I want you to mirror everything they are doing and start your search from here.
OK, what kind of search?
what's the largest base of knowledge we have on Saunders?
financial.
OK, follow the bank trails.
I will have to clear it with Chappelle.
no, you can't do that.
well, he gave the order. He outranks you, Jack.
Chloe, you are gonna do what I asked you, ok?
and you are not gonna let Chappelle know, you got it?
no, I don't got it. He's mad at me for, like 12 things. I am not ganna add that to the list.
Chloe
Chloe, I wouldn't ask you to do it like this if it wasn't very important.
OK, so, please just do this for me.
fine.
thank you.
nearly a third of the people in this hotel are symptomatic, and it's getting worse every minute.
they should have the choice to end their own lives.
the capsules should be there soon.
Tony?
Yeah.
I realize we have both been talking around this, but...
if my test comes back positive...
Michelle, don't go there.
sweetheart, we both know my chances of survival are low.
you still have a chance, and while there's still a chance,
I don't want to talk about this.
OK, just...
no matter what, I just want you to know, the last 3 years have been the best years of my life.
I should be there with you.
you are.
no, it's not the same.
the best thing you can do for me right now is to make sure those capsules get here.
I will do my best.
I know you will.
Tony, I need to speak to you.
Michelle?
yeah
did she get the test results back yet?
no, they won't have them back for another hour yet.
what's going on?
do you know if Saunders and Chappelle had any history if their paths had ever crossed?
not that I am aware of.
what kind of connection are you looking for?
the kind that would make Saunders want Chappelle killed.
because that's exactly what he just ordered the President to do.
by 7: 00 a. m. he wants Ryan Chappelle dead.
Why?
that's what I am trying to figure out.
and the President put this on you.
I don't know what I am going to do if we don't find Saunders by 7: 00
have you told Ryan about this?
no, not yet.
I should probably change his security clearance before you do.
you really think he is a flight risk?
we can't take a chance right now.
we have to find Saunders.
I will get Chappelle to send all his data over to Chloe.
you prepare her and whoever else you can spare to sort through it.
they are gonna want to know what's going on.
they don't need to know.
I will take care of it.
thank you
Chloe Yeah.
I need you to put all your protocols on hold for at least an hour.
got it.
what did the President want to talk to you about?
you.
me?
what about me?
Ryan, come with me.
just take a seat.
what's going on here, Jack?
Saunders called in with another demand.
what does he want now?
Jack
he wants you killed.
is this some kind of a joke?
it's no joke, Ryan.
he's threatened to release the virus into the main population unless we deliver your body by 7: 00 a. m.
what, did Palmer actually go along with this?
my god, Jack
he has proven he will use the virus. The President had no choice.
so he sent you to kill me?
not if we can find Saunders before 7: 00 a. m.
Oh, great, that gives us a lot of time, doesn't it?
I, I don't understand this, why me?
we don't know.
Ryan, I need you to think real hard.
do you have any past connection with Saunders that we don't know about?
no.
the first time I heard the name Stephen Saunders was today.
the money transactions that you have been investigating that's what must have triggered this.
I haven't had the chance to trace them to Saunders yet.
the fact that he wants you dead
that proves that they lead back to him.
and you expect to figure this out by 7: 00?
finding Saunders in time is the only way to keep you alive.
and I will use everything in my disposal to do that.
Ryan, I need your help.
I need all your files, and I mean everything sent over to Chloe's desk so she can start going through it.
I am sorry, Ryan.
let's find this guy.
what have you got, Ryan?
I found Saunders" offshore bank account in the Caymans.
I was able to access his account information off their network, but it's encrypted.
another brick wall.
just send it over to Chloe's desk.
if anyone can break the encryption, she can.
not in the time that we have.
you don't know that, Ryan.
it has to be now, Jack, now.
this is it.
don't you understand?
of course you understand.
you are the one who is going to kill me.
we are doing everything we can.
don't you realize the possibility that this might not even be relevant?
Saunders knows if he kills me, it doesn't kill the investigation.
he might want me dead for something else I know, something I haven't made a connection with yet.
well, then think, Ryan, think.
but don't give in to this bastard.
with all of us working together, we are going to find this guy, ok?
send the encrypted account over to Chloe's desk, I will explain it to her. Come on.
Chloe, Ryan is forwarding a file to you.
please let me, let me call my wife.
I am sorry, we are still under orders to keep what's going on secret, so we don't create panic.
Yeah, I won't tell her anything, and your people can listen in.
that order comes directly from the President.
I have done everything I can do to help you, please.
I just want, I just want to hear her voice, please.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
can I have your attention, please
what I'm about to tell you will be difficult to hear, but it's important that you have all the information so you can each make your own decision.
first, I want all of you to know that ...
once symptoms of infection appear, there is no chance of recovery.
as the virus progresses, it attacks the body's organs and major blood vessels.
this process is extremely painful.
the estimated time of death is within 6 hours.
I am telling you all of this as directly as possible because we can offer each of you an alternative
some pills you can take that will basically make you feel like you are going to sleep.
it will be up to each one of you to decide when, and if you want to use these drugs.
they will be available shortly.
thank you
Michelle, we have a situation.
a woman came forward to tell us she can't find the man she was here with.
she hasn't seen him for a few hours.
are you sure he is not in isolation?
Yeah, we let her look.
what's his name?
that's part of the problem. She claims she doesn't know.
I am agent Michelle Dessler.
I am Kathy, Kathy McCartney.
you realize how important it is that we account for everyone who may have been infected.
Yes, that's why I cameforward.
we need you to be completely honest.
I am.
all I know is that his name is Bill, and I am not even sure if that's real.
what do you mean?
we met tonight at a club on hill, and we really connected, so we decided to come here.
who booked the room?
I did.
do you remember the last time you saw him?
Oh, we fell asleep together in the room, and when the fire alarm woke me up, he was gone.
do you remember what time you fell asleep?
I know exactly, I looked at the clock. it was 4: 02
stay here, please.
if she is right about the time, then this man was in the hotel when the virus was released and he got out of the building before it was completely locked down.
is it possible he is hiding somewhere in the hotel?
no, no.
we have accounted for everyone in the guest rooms, and we have done an infrared sweep of all the public areas.
ed, get a forensic team up to her room, dust for prints.
there will be dozens of people's prints in there.
just do it.
this is agent Miller. We need a forensic team right now.
Kathy, I need you to come with me.
Why?
you need to show me every surface that Bill may have touched.
come on.
thanks
Chloe needs as much processing power as she can get.
I need you to open up another socket in the network for her.
how's he going?
he's scared.
all right, Chase has a strike team assembled.
they're ready to go as soon as we get a location on Saunders.
also, I ordered you a helicopter from air tactical.
train yard has all the way across town.
we can't afford to be slowed down by rush hour traffic.
OK, good.
I will get the socket open for Chloe.
thanks a lot
Jack, the bank used deep encryption. We are going to have to use a password crack.
how long is that going to take?
it'll take as long as 90 minutes.
we don't have that much time.
I am doing the best I can. Maybe it would help if you told us why this is overriding other protocols.
the only thing you need to know is I need these files decrypted now.
I am doing my very best. Your tone of voice is not exactly a morale booster.
Chloe, please just do it.
Chloe, let me help, we can parallel process.
OK, good idea.
Oh, Ryan
I am sorry, Mr. Chappelle. We are not allowed to let you leave.
what?
please return to CTU, sir.
who the hell do you think ...
we have orders.
from who?
I am regional director, I countermand any order you have been given.
Ryan
what the hell's going on here, Jack?
why aren't I being allowed to leave the building?
you think I am trying to run?
I am going outside to smoke a cigarette.
I wouldn't condemn millions of people to death so I could live.
let me see the cigarettes.
these men will escort you back to holding.
I don't think so.
I am not asking, Ryan.
under the authority given to me by the President of the United States,
I am ordering you.
Tony, it's me. We have a problem.
we just determined a man who was exposed to the virus got out of the hotel
son of a bitch. How'd that happen?
he must have slipped out right before we reinforced the perimeter.
it's likely he had no idea he'd been exposed.
have you notified Health Services?
Yeah, they are aware of the situation.
the problem is, we don't know who he is.
he wasn't a registered guest.
what was he doing inside the hotel?
having a one night stand.
the woman he was with came forward.
any sign of him on the surveillance cameras?
nothing at the front desk, and no one seems to have seen him come or go.
what are we doing to find him?
our best shot to ID him is off prints.
we have already pulled dozens from all the obvious surfaces, light switches bathroom fixtures.
all right, look, send the prints over to us; we will work them up.
see what else you can find off this woman.
got it.
it's all I can remember. OK.
I am sorry I can't be more helpful.
no, you are doing great.
let's just go over this one more time.
the two of you came into the room...
I had the key, so I am the one who opened the door.
we didn't turn the lights on or off.
did he go over to the window draw the blinds?
no, we just started kissing right away.
where were you standing?
I was here, by the bed.
and then what happened?
he started taking my clothes off.
the clothes you are wearing now?
Yeah. He pulled my shirt over my head and then my pants and then
I need your belt
Miller, try the buckle.
prints look like hers.
hold it.
I got a partial thumb.
it's not hers?
checking
no. She's got inverse swirls. This print doesn't.
upload it to CTU, now.
if we don't find this guy before he becomes symptomatic, we might be looking at an outbreak.
where have you been?
I had a client meeting.
I told you that I wouldn't come home if it went too late.
that's right.
I kind of wish you would have called. I was worried.
I didn't want to wake you up.
Jack, I think I am getting something.
applying the last layer of key words, it worked, we cracked the decryption.
we have access to Saunders' bank account.
go into the header, tell me what address they have got on him.
there is several across the country, one in Los Angels.
an apartment downtown, 5 minutes from here.
how do we know the address is real?
every time the money is moved, the bank confirms the physical location of that call.
Saunders called in a transfer 45 minutes ago from that address.
I will call Chase.
tell him not to go in hard.
Saunders can't see us coming.
good work. Great work.
thank you.
open it.
Ryan, I think we found Saunders.
through his bank account?
Yeah. 45 minutes ago he made a call from an apartment not far from here.
chase is leading a strike team over there now.
good, Jack. Thank God.
Ryan, we still need to go over to the train yard.
now?
what are you talking about?
we have to be in place before the deadline, just in case the strike team isn't successful.
but you said they know he was there 45 minutes ago.
Ryan, this is just a precaution.
we have to do it until we have him in custody, you know that
I have got a helicopter waiting for us over in the north annex, but we should go now.
all right, Jack.
OK.
we will be in touch as soon as we are airborne.
all right.
Mr. Chappelle, division called to confirm your 3: 00 briefing.
is that still good?
sure.
Mr. President.
Helen Stuppen from the LA Times just called my office.
she was asking about some kind of toxic accident at the Chandler Plaza Hotel, and if it was connected to the red alert.
what exactly did she say?
not much. She was fishing.
Mr. President, I appreciate that you need to keep certain things from me, but this story will get out, and when it does, I'll need to have answers.
Jerry is right, David.
and the soon we bring him into the loop, the better he can handle the press.
a weaponized virus was released into that hotel's ventilation system.
Oh, my God.
when will you go public with this?
once we are sure that the virus has been contained and there is no longer a threat.
and how certain are you that it will be contained?
we are doing everything possible.
Yes, sir.
Jack
Tony said you are not coming with me to get Saunders.
that's right. You and Baker are heading up the strike team.
wait. I don't understand. Saunders is the priority.
I've ordered Jack downtown to answer a few more questions.
you know what, Ryan, all you do is put obstacles in our way.
we have a chance to get Saunders.
we need our best people.
you tie us down with your bureaucratic BS.
chase.
those are the orders.
what's going on, Jack?
just take care of the strike team.
any sign that he is in there?
I can't get a visual inside.
we have got 3 men outside the building.
we can take them out with a sniper.
no, we can't do that.
if we miss, Saunders will know we are here.
I want to do this up close.
the building is out in the open, they will see us coming from a block away.
that's why Saunders picked the place.
I don't see how we get to them before they can warn Saunders.
I do.
they are grounding flights from LAX.
did all the couriers get out with their vials?
new York, Washington, San Francisco made it through.
they are on their way.
I rerouted Las Vegas. Our man is driving there now.
but we missed Chicago and Cleveland.
did you revise the casualty projections?
of course.
just give me the number.
2 to 5 million dead within the first 48 hours.
good enough.
sir, there is a chance that the outbreak will spread beyond the Americas.
we'll be fine. Don't worry.
Tony, we got results back on the fingerprint from the hotel.
what do you got?
if it had been a complete print obviously there should be only one true match.
but because it's a partial, we get results from anyone whose fingerprints match that particular guardant.
how many potential matches we talking about?
the FBI database gave us almost 300 possibilities.
all right, look, upload those pictures to Michelle at the hotel. Have that woman go through them.
OK, I am on it.
Tony, Ryan Chappelle on line 3
Ryan
what's taking Edmunds so long?
has he even called in yet?
he's moving his strike team into position around Saunders' building right now.
what are they waiting for? Why haven't they gone in?
they are preparing a covert entry, Ryan.
it takes a little time.
well, get on them, Tony, get those men into that building.
Ryan, Chase is running this operation on the ground, he needs to make this call.
Ryan, Chase knows what's at stake here.
he's going to go in when it's safe. Just try and relax.
Ryan, you still there?
I am here.
all right, I am hooking you up to the real time com feed.
good.
Tony, I have got a visual on the train yard.
copy that.
there's no one in the lobby
Baker and I are moving up the stairs.
graves and Martinez are coming down from the roof.
guard at the top of the stairs has been taken out.
we are proceeding down the hall.
we got one man by the door.
we have got to move fast. On my lead.
set.
clear.
no one is here.
it's a switching node.
he's been relaying calls from this location. Damn it
this is Bauer.
you underestimate me, Jack.
Saunders, why are you doing this?
even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.
try me.
tell your people not to bother tracing that relay.
I have already switched to another node.
stephen
a van will be arriving shortly.
leave Chappelle's body with the driver.
do not attempt to follow the van.
if you don't follow my directions, I will release the virus immediately.
can I have everyone's attention, please
these are the drugs agent Dessler told you about earlier.
anyone who wants to exercise this option can step forward.
Michelle.
did you find a match?
partial thumbprint gave us a few hundred possibles, which we narrowed down to a dozen men.
we uploaded the pictures, Ms. Mccartney is looking at them now.
that's not him.
no, no, no, no
this one, I think that's him.
are you sure?
Yeah.
I am sure.
find him
are you ok, William
you have been in there for awhile.
I have some kind of bug.
you want me to make some tea?
no, I am fine.
are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got to go to the office. I have a staff meeting.
OK
Kaufman.
this is Jack. Have you got satellite coverage on my position now?
not yet, but I will reposition.
there is a black van, no plates.
I am sure they are gonna use counter measures, but do everything you can do to follow it.
OK
we have to go, Ryan.
my legs are shaking.
I have got you.
Ryan, is there anyone you want to talk to?
what do you mean, to say goodbye?
to say whatever you have to.
I have a brother I haven't spoken to in years.
I don't have that many friends.
just the people at work. So, no.
there is no one.
I am sorry, Ryan, we got to do this.
get on your knees.
there is no way around this, right, Jack?
we don't have any outs here?
not that I can see.
wait.
all right, let me do this myself.
at least give me the dignity of taking my own life.
that's something you can do.
no, Ryan, I can't do that.
Yes, you can
you were right back at CTU to put me under watch.
I wasn't going out for a cigarette.
I was trying to bolt.
but I know this has to happen.
I can't take that chance.
I am giving you my word, Jack
I won't run, I swear.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared, but I am not gonna run.
I couldn't live with myself knowing I was responsible for the deaths of all those people.
you got to believe me.
I can't, I can't
it's alright.
I am sorry we let you down, Ryan.
God forgive me.
we release the sentox here and 200, 000 people die.
we need access to the control room.
Jack, Bierko will be ready to deploy any minute.
if we could ignite that gas before it leaves the plant, the sentox will be incinerated.
give me a hand.
organize an escort team.
you get him back to CTU alive.
you got it.
I just word from the FAA about a hijacking aboard a diplomatic flight.
so what?
Jack Bauer is the hijacker.
what was he doing on that flight?
looking for the recording that implicates me in David Palmer' s death.
order the plane down and grab Bauer before he can hurt us.
we need to take him down now, dead or alive.
Mr. President?
I don't care whether Bauer' s making threats or not, that plane has to land immediately.
and when it lands, I want my secret service detail to take him into custody.
sit down!
he has a gun!
everybody just stay in your seats!
do what I tell you and no one will get hurt!
captain, this is Jack Bauer.
I'm speaking to you on a discreet channel.
the person that I'm looking for the man with the evidence that I need is sitting next to you.
he's your copilot, Scott Evans.
you need to open the door.
could you take the stick for a second?
I'm the only one who can fly this plane now!
give me the recording.
advise CTU I have the recording.
I'll be on the ground in less than 15 minutes.
Bauer' s got the evidence.
he is in control of the plane.
what do we do?
you are going to have to shoot down that plane, Mr. President.
otherwise you'll go to prison for treason and murder.
sierra tango, cleared to flight level 220, report reaching.
5-2-0, sierra tango descend to flight level 220.
we can expect the approach to Van Nuys.
good.
this is Jack Bauer.
can you patch me through to Karen Hayes?
hold please.
I'm bleeding.
I think you broke my nose.
you'll get medical attention as soon as we're on the ground.
right now, your only concern should be flying this plane.
miss Hayes, I've got Jack Bauer on line one.
put him through.
I've got the recording.
it was on the copilot.
the copilot?
he was working for Henderson.
the captain' s unconscious, but I've secured the copilot.
we're in route back to Van Nuys airfield.
what's our ETA?
21 minutes.
we're going to be on the ground in 21 minutes.
Karen, listen to me.
this recording proves that president Logan was complicit in David Palmer' s assassination.
it's imperative that we do not let it fall into the hands of anyone that is loyal to the president.
as soon as we're on the ground, I'm going to need you to provide me with a safe corridor back to CTU.
Jack, it's Bill.
I'm back here with Karen.
I'll explain everything later.
we can dispatch a team to meet you at the airfield.
they can head off any law enforcement, take you into protective custody.
okay, good.
bill, how is Audrey?
Curtis just brought her in.
she's in medical getting treated, but it looks like she's going to be okay.
thank god.
okay, I'll get back to you as soon as we're on final approach.
all right.
I just got off the phone with county general.
I have some great news.
your father survived the crash.
he's alive?
one of our teams picked him up about 30 minutes ago at the accident site.
he's still in ICU, but they expect him to pull through.
Oh, my god.
we have a team stationed at the hospital.
he'll be well-protected.
thank you.
I have to take this.
thank you so much.
you're welcome.
this is Manning.
is Henderson secured?
he's in holding room three.
good.
I need you to take a team to pick up Jack.
where is he?
he's on a plane heading towards the Van Nuys airport.
ETA is 20 minutes.
why is he on a plane?
he had to commandeer the plane in order to secure the evidence against president Logan.
I'll brief you with the details in route.
Curtis, I cannot emphasize strongly enough the explosive nature of the evidence that Jack is carrying.
I need you to put him into protective custody and bring him back here to CTU.
understood.
president Logan will probably send his men to retrieve it.
you've got to get to Jack first.
we will.
I'm heading out.
yes?
we have a solution that will allow you to order the plane shot down.
I sure as hell hope so.
I may be the president, but there are protocols in place that I can't just ignore.
what we're proposing will circumvent your protocols.
what is it?
we're going to simulate a VCI distress signal.
it'll be broadcast on the airplane's transponder code, and it will appear to come from Bauer' s flight.
hold on.
what is a VCI distress signal?
it's an emergency signal indicating that there's a hijacking in progress, and that the perpetrators intend to use the aircraft as a weapon.
it'll give you the pretext to shoot it down.
there really is no other legitimate response to this scenario, Mr. President.
all you need to do is appear to struggle with the ethics and then give the order.
Mr. President?
fine.
all right.
you sound reluctant.
I can't believe it's come to this.
I'm going to shoot down a plane full of innocent people.
none of us is happy about this, Mr. President, but you don't really have a choice.
Bauer has evidence implicating you in this conspiracy.
we should contact Chloe and bring her in.
we're going to want her help bringing Jack back to CTU.
fine.
send an escort.
I appreciate this.
I know you're putting everything on the line to help us.
all I can say is this recording better be everything Jack claims it is.
I know Jack.
I don't always agree with his methods, but I trust his judgment.
I'll go make that call.
what's going on?
what's Buchanan doing out of holding?
the situation has changed, Miles.
there's some new intel.
I haven't seen anything.
what new intel?
I don't have time to explain it right now.
what does that mean?
it means that I'll brief you when I've got the chance.
have you compiled the orders for Bierko's transfer?
I'm still working on them.
let me know when you've got them.
what is it, Mike?
a situation has come up regarding the hijacked plane.
tell me what's happening.
the FAA just picked up a VCI distress code.
it originated from flight st-520.
what's a VCI distress code?
the VCI is a coding system that was recently installed on all commercial airliners.
this particular code indicates that a hijacking is underway, and that the plane is going to be used to target installations on the ground.
Oh, my god.
Admiral Kirkland is standing by on video-conference from Point Mugu.
he's ready to brief you with the details.
Admiral Kirkland, I'm Mike Novick.
I have the president here.
Mr. President.
Admiral.
Mike's told me about this VCI signal.
how could it have been sent without Bauer' s knowledge?
most likely, one of the pilots under duress secretly activated the transponder code.
let me get this straight.
at last report, Bauer was in the passenger cabin.
does this mean that he's now in the cockpit and that he's in control of the plane?
it appears that way, sir.
what do we do, admiral?
sir, the protocols for this scenario are clearly specified.
we're compelled to take preemptive action.
what action?
the aircraft must be shot down.
we've already scrambled an f-18 out of Point Mugu.
we just need your approval to engage.
there are over 50 people on that plane, admiral.
we have to think of the people on the ground, Mr. President.
over 20 million citizens live in Los Angeles county, each one of them is now a potential target.
I don't believe this.
Mr. President, if I can interject.
Admiral, it's hard for me to accept that Bauer intends to use the aircraft as a weapon against civilians.
from my briefing document, Jack Bauer is a distraught individual with a history of erratic behavior.
Jack Bauer has spent his entire career protecting American lives.
I think there's a reason he's doing what he's doing.
what would that be?
I don't have the answer, but we should at least try to find out.
we don't have the time.
Mr. President, we could have the f-18 shadow the aircraft.
we could issue a standing order to fire only if the target deviates from its present course.
that's not a viable option, Mr. President.
why not?
right now, that plane is over the desert.
in another 15 minutes, it'll be above Los Angeles.
if we're forced to shoot it down then, there'll be facing massive casualties on the ground.
and, Mr. President, we must also consider the possibility that Bauer intends to attack the presidential retreat.
the retreat?
you're inside the target zone, and Bauer' s already been accused of killing one president today.
the simple fact is, sir, we don't know what his intentions are.
Mr. President...
Mike. Stop.
I've made my decision.
Admiral, I'm authorizing you to shoot down that plane.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President...
Mike, please.
don't make this any more difficult for me than it already is.
miss Hayes.
this just came in over the interagency sub-net.
what is it?
we have to alert Jack.
this is Bauer.
air traffic control just received a VCI distress signal from your aircraft.
that effectively authorizes president Logan to shoot you down.
shoot us down?
and f - 18's been scrambled out of Point Mugu, Jack.
you have eight to ten minutes at best.
can you patch me through to the pilot of the f - 18?
no chance.
they're on a coded frequency.
we can try to get in touch with the White House.
and tell them what?
they don't want to hear anything I have to say.
hold on.
we need to land this plane now.
we're 100 miles from the nearest airport.
they just scrambled an f - 18 to shoot us out of the sky.
we need to get on the ground now!
you didn't hear me.
there's nowhere to land.
how much runway do you need?
at least 5, 000 feet.
bill, do you hear me?
I need you to look for a stretch of freeway 5,000 feet long, straight enough for us to land on.
I'll pull up maps in the area, Jack.
it'll take a few seconds.
get back to me as soon as you've got something.
we can't land on the freeway.
Yes, we can.
it's late, there's a curfew.
there won't be any cars on the freeway.
cuff your right hand to the flight control, now.
start taking us down.
do it now.
what's Chloe O'brian doing here?
I don't know.
you can go.
what's going on?
an f - 18's been scrambled to shoot down Jack's plane.
can you open up a socket with the ATC radar tracking plot?
Yeah, I think so.
do it, Chloe.
we need to know the exact amount of time Jack has before the fighter plane reaches him.
okay.
Karen, look at this.
two possible landing sites.
I think this one's the best shot.
I agree.
let's get jack on the phone.
I need to speak with you.
we need to make an emergency landing.
talk to your passengers and get them ready.
what's happening?
don't worry.
everything's gonna be fine.
just get them ready.
okay.
okay.
listen up, everybody.
we're going to prepare for an emergency landing.
the proper procedure...
it's Bauer.
Jack, it's Bill, I think we found something.
bill, hold on one sec.
I want to put you on speakerphone.
go ahead.
it's a stretch of the 118 freeway between mile marker 91 and 92.
there's about 4,000 feet, then there's an overpass.
that's not long enough.
it's the best we can do.
copy that, Bill.
hold on, give me a second.
you can either try and land this plane on the freeway or I will.
give me the coordinates.
3-4-5-0. 2 north by 1-1-0-3-0. 4 west.
we need to know where that f - 18 is.
Jack, it's Chloe.
I'm working on it.
Manning.
we have the exact location where Jack's putting down.
go ahead.
it's the 118 freeway between mile markers 91 and 92.
he should be on the ground within minutes.
copy.
we're redirecting.
118 freeway.
Mr. President, we're five minutes away.
I'm patching us in directly with the pilot of the f - 18.
go ahead.
this is admiral Kirkland.
you're on with the president and myself.
report status.
my radar is locked onto the target.
okay, I've got the ATC radar plot.
put it on the main screen.
Jack, the f - 18 is within 15 miles.
he's gonna be within the missile range in two minutes.
you're not descending fast enough.
if we don't get on the ground before that f - 18 reaches us, it's not gonna matter. Descend now!
put the oxygen masks on!
target has increased angle and rate of descent.
one minute from missile lock.
Jack, they're almost within weapons range.
the aircraft can't take this.
I have to pull up.
not yet!
I can see the freeway!
come on.
okay, level up now!
now!
I need your help!
pull!
ground proximity alert.
20 seconds to missile lock.
target's at 1,000 feet and leveling.
Leveling?
affirmative, sir.
what does that mean?
target may be preparing to land.
the objective seems to be the 118 freeway.
lower the landing gear!
we're going too fast!
lower it!
he's lowering his landing gear.
the f - 18's in range.
I have missile locked.
the aircraft is in a landing profile, sir.
I recommend we abort.
what?
the parameters have changed, sir.
I want that plane shot down!
sir...
order your man to fire, now!
Mr. President!
Admiral Kirkland is right.
the aircraft's not a threat.
there's no reason to do this.
I implore you to reconsider.
abort.
Yes, sir.
but if they don't land, I want you to shoot that plane down immediately!
Yes, Mr. President.
Bravo one, hold fire.
I repeat, hold fire.
copy, base.
Bravo one holding fire.
we have marine units deployed in the area.
I want them to cordon off the landing site and apprehend Jack Bauer.
Yes, sir.
500 feet!
we're not gonna make it.
come on.
CTU, We've spotted the plane.
they're coming in for a landing.
we're heading towards them now.
I'm handing the controls back to you!
touch it down!
we're still going too fast!
touch it down!
target has touched down.
returning to base.
bill, we made it.
we're down on the ground.
Jack, we've redirected Curtis to your location.
he should be there in a few minutes.
I'm just east of the balboa overpass.
have him meet me there.
send a secondary team to pick up the copilot.
got it.
get out of there, Jack!
everyone, keep moving to the rear of the plane!
exit from the rear, now!
you should have followed through, Mr. President.
you should have ordered that pilot to fire.
they were landing on a freeway.
I had no pretext to shoot them down.
I had to abort.
it's going to be much harder to contain now, if not impossible.
Bauer's on the ground.
he won't get far.
even before the plane touched down,I ordered two battalions of marines into the area.
they're cordoning off the landing site, even as we speak.
has nowhere to run.
I hope you're right, Mr. President.
this is our last chance.
if Bauer gets through...
I know.
I know what's at stake, Graham.
I'll get back to you as soon as I have any news.
Curtis, it's Jack!
go ahead.
the marines are moving in.
they're setting up a perimeter.
where are you?
we're approaching your position from the north.
okay, I got you.
I'll meet you on the north side of the freeway.
they know I'm still in the area. We got to get out of here.
head south on variel. Move.
damn it. You're gonna have to try and talk your way through the roadblock.
get your hands up!
hands where we can see them.
we're federal agents.
Los Angeles counter terrorist unit.
we've been given orders to detain everybody inside this perimeter.
we're all on the same team here, commander. We're trying to apprehend the suspect who hijacked that plane.
Jack Bauer? - That's right. Now, let us do our job.
I need to see individual id' S. I'm gonna call this in.
we don't have time for this, commander. The longer we sit here, the better chance Bauer has of slipping through the net.
this will only take a few minutes. - A few minutes is all Bauer needs to escape.
we're not prepared to let that happen.
now we're moving out. If you really want to fire on federal agents, that's your call.
stand down.
move out.
stand down!
head east for a while, then turn south.
Yes, sir.
Buchanan. - It's curtis.
we've got Jack, and we're headed back in. -Okay, Curtis.
Marines are all over the place. Barely got past one of the patrols.
they must be taking direct orders from Logan. There's no other explanation.
we can't take the chance of running into any more of these patrols.
we'll stick to the back streets. - Understood.
I want to know what's going on.
miles, I told you I would tell you when I felt the time was right.
I'm sitting here watching you work with two people under arrest for aiding and abetting a federal fugitive.
if you don't talk to me, I'll have to get my answers somewhere else.
I'll be right there.
you can't tell him. - I can't hold him off any longer.
you really think that's a good idea?
I have to trust him.
he's been nothing but loyal.
I probably shouldn't have kept him in the dark this long.
I'll be right back.
I don't appreciate being threatened, Miles.
and I don't appreciate being shut out.
we've worked a lot of years together, karen, and I have never wavered in my allegiance.
I don't deserve this.
no, you don't.
come with me.
Jack Bauer's acquired evidence implicating president Logan in David Palmer's death.
have you seen this evidence? - No, but Bauer's bringing it here now.
what is it?
it's a recording of a conversation between the president and an accomplice.
but you haven't heard it? - No.
and that's what you're doing with Buchanan and O'brian?
covertly helping Bauer?
Yes.
for the past three hours, president Logan has done everything in his power to keep Jack from getting back here alive.
you're working against the most powerful man in the world, and you haven't actually heard the evidence.
this is why I didn't talk to you, Miles. - Because you knew I'd talk you out of it.
Yes, I know what I'm doing is risky. If I am wrong, my career is over. I could be brought up on charges.
not just your career, Karen.
I am doing this because I believe that Bauer is telling the truth.
but you don't know.
okay, okay.
let's say he is.
let's say that recording implicates Logan.
then what are you going to do?
are you going to arrest the president of the United States?
that will be up to the attorney general.
you're depending on... - I'm sorry to interrupt.
Yes. They're ready to move Bierko.
thank you. I'll be right out.
look, I have to go over the transfer protocols.
I know that what I'm asking from you is difficult.
everything rests with what's on that recording.
tell me what you need.
Bauer will be here any minute.
the best way for you to help me is to go back out there and keep things running smoothly.
all right. - Miles?
it's imperative this stay between us. - Of course.
thank you.
thank you.
we have a full tactical complement, enhanced ordinance package, two vehicle escort.
vladimir bierko, you're being transferred to a primary holding facility at our district headquarters.
let me know the second he arrives. - Understood.
let's move out.
let's go.
where the hell is Mike Novick? - He's moments away, sir.
you told me that three minutes ago.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr. President. I was on the phone with Colonel Owens.
he's the marine field commander on the site.
is Bauer in custody? - No, sir.
what happened?
as ordered, the marines sealed off a one-mile radius around the landing site.
they've completed a sweep of the area.
And?
and it's Colonel Owens' estimation that Bauer is no longer inside the perimeter.
he got away. - It appears so, sir.
I can't believe this.
uh, Mr. President, it's only a matter of time before Bauer's apprehended.
sir, are you all right?
thank you, Mike. I need some time alone now.
Jack, the attorney general's on his way to his office right now.
he'll be ready for a video conference in ten minutes.
okay, good. Chloe, I want you to prepare the recording for playback.
I want you to clean it up and apply a digital signature so that we can establish a chain of evidence.
okay. - You need to work alone.
I don't want anyone else near that recording. You don't ever let it out of your sight.
I won't. - You said I had ten minutes.
I'd like to see Audrey. - Of course. She's in medical.
thank you.
well, when will I be able to speak with him?
well, just let him know...
can you please tell him that his daughter called and that she loves him very much.
thank you.
it looks like my dad's gonna be all right.
Yeah, I know, I heard.
Oh, god, I'm so glad to see you.
me, too.
we did it.
we got the evidence.
the attorney general's going to hear it.
so it's over? - Yeah.
president Logan's going to pay for David Palmer's assassination.
thank you.
close your eyes.
I'm going to sit with you for a minute.
Yes. - Graham.
I've been trying to reach you. - I know.
Bauer slipped through the cordon, didn't he? - Yes.
I've just been told that the attorney general's office received a phone call from the director of CTU.
I think it's fairly obvious they're in possession of the recording.
I think that phone call was about you.
I didn't expect it would to happen so soon.
I am sorry, Charles.
you don't deserve this.
listen, Graham, despite how things turned out，I still believe that we were in the right.I still believe that we acted in the best interest of the country.
and we have to keep putting the country's well-being ahead of our own.
the spectacle of a sitting president on trial for murder would be devastating.
Yes. Yes, it would.
aside from the psychological damage to the country, a trial would expose certain realities that should never see the light of day.
if only we could keep such a trial from taking place.
that thought occurred to me, as well.
I'm glad we agree.
I want you to know I've taken steps to ensure that you and your associates won't be implicated in any of this.
I appreciate that, Charles.
we all do.
there's nothing more to say.
I'm going to hang up now. There are, uh, a few things I'd like to take care of before...
good-bye, Charles.
good-bye, Graham.
Martha, may I come in?
now you want to talk?
Marti, please?
what do you want?
is there something else you want to confess?
no.
I want to tell you how sorry I am for everything.
when you forget to give me something for my birthday, that's when you say you're sorry.
I know what I did was wrong. It was horribly wrong and unforgivable. I know that.
but what I can't live with is the fact that I hurt you.
that's the last thing I wanted to do.
Marti, please.
that's the truth.
the truth.You know what really gets me,Charles?
what?
that you had me going for so long.
I had no idea you were such a good liar.
if I wasn't so horrified by the fact that I'm married to you, I might actually be impressed.
Yes.
I have an urgent call for you, sir. He says his name is Miles Papazian from CTU.
I don't want to talk to anyone from CTU.
he insists that you'll want to speak to him.
he says it's about Jack Bauer.
put him through. - Yes, sir.
go ahead, You're on with the president.
Mr. President?
Yes, go ahead.
you don't know me;my name is Miles Papazian. I work under Karen Hayes.
what is this about?
it's about a recording, sir, that Jack Bauer has just delivered here to CTU.
sir, my understanding is it's a recording of a conversation of yours that, if leaked, could significantly compromise national security.
go on.
my superior, Ms. Hayes, is working with Bauer and Bill Buchanan.
their intention is to play the recording for the attorney general.
why are you telling me this? - Because, sir，I feel compelled to intervene.
and I just I wanted to make sure that you would approve.
I do, Mr. Papazian, I do approve.
listen, I'm going to text you my private number.
let me know how it goes.
and, Miles, I promise you, I won't forget this.
thank you, sir. That's all I wanted to hear.
Mr. President, I look forward to speaking with you again soon.
Karen wants to know how long before the teleconference starts?
five minutes, get out of here, Miles.
we'll be ready. - Not if you keep interrupting me.
I'm just doing my job, Chloe.
well, if your job is to slow things down, then you're doing really good work.
I'll tell Karen you'll be ready.
Thanks.
this is Bauer.
Jack, air traffic control just received a VCI distress signal from your aircraft that effectively authorizes President Logan to shoot you down.
start taking us down.
do it now.
Jack, the F-18 is within 15 miles.
my radar is locked onto the target.
lower the landing gear! - We're going too fast!
touch it down!
we're ready to move Bierko. - Thank you. I'll be right out.
vladimir Bierko, you're being transferred to a primary holding facility in our district headquarters.
Jack, the Attorney General is on his way to his office right now.
he'll be ready for a video conference in ten minutes.
Chloe, I want you to prepare the recording for playback.
I want you to clean it up and apply a digital signature so we can establish a chain of evidence.
you work alone.
we got the evidence. President Logan's going to pay for David Palmer's assassination.
the spectacle of a sitting President on trial for murder would be devastating.
Yes, it would.
if only there were a way that we could prevent such a trial from taking place.
Mr. President?
you don't know me. My name is Miles Papazian, I work under Karen Hayes.
what is this about?
it's about a recording, sir, if leaked, could significantly compromise national security.
why are you telling me this?
I feel compelled to intervene, and I just I wanted to make sure that you would approve.
I do, Mr. Papazian, I do approve.
get out of here, Miles.
I'm just doing my job, Chloe.
well, if your job is is to slow things down, then you're doing really good work.
I'll tell Karen you'll be ready.
the following takes place between 4: 00 a.m. and 5: 00 a.m.
the Attorney General will be on the line in five minutes.
did you tell him that the recording implicates President Logan in Palmer's assassination?
no. I feel he needs to hear it directly from the source.
fine.
we're minutes away, Chloe, what's your status?
everything is set up. I've got a T-1 line hooked in to the Attorney General, the other two lines are secured on dedicated channels.
what other two lines?
we're patching in a representative from the house judiciary committee and a congressional liaison.
we need their support to call for an emergency session of congress to begin impeachment proceedings.
impeachment proceedings? What about an arrest warrant?
we'll never get justice to indict a sitting President.
removing him from office is a necessary step to begin full criminal prosecution.
all right, Chloe, let's check the sound levels. Play the recording.
what's wrong? - I don't know.
what do you mean you don't know? Where's the recording?
this is what's on the digital medium.
that's impossible. See if there's an overlay, check your connections.
there are no mistakes.
damn it, Chloe, you were responsible for this recording. What the hell happened?
I just told you, I don't know.
but if there was something on this memory chip, it's been erased.
yes? - Excuse me, Ms. Hayes.
the Attorney General's holding on the line.
ms. Hayes? - I heard you.
bill Buchanan will take the call in a moment.
I'll tell him we're having technical difficulties, we need to postpone the conference.
someone got to that recording.
perhaps it was damaged in your attempts to retrieve it.
it wasn't.
Chloe, who had access to this room?
no one. - Someone did!
who had access to this room -- think about it!
miles was in here. - What?
you sent him in here to check up on me while I was setting up.
I never sent him in here!
security, stop Mr. Bauer.
Mr. Bauer!
Jack, stop!
you son of a bitch.
let go of me, Bauer.
do you know how many people lost their lives so I could bring that evidence in?
I don't know what you're talking about.
we know it was you.
let him go, Jack.
Jack, let him go!
where are you going, Miles?
I've been transferred. I was told to report immediately.
the order should be coming through any minute.
transferred to where?
the White House.
how could you do this, Miles?
this is not over.
there will be an investigation. - Do what you have to do, Karen...
...but I work for the president now.
Jack, I'm so sorry.
I don't know how he did it, he didn't even touch the recorder.
Karen, Audrey Raines heard the recording when I played it for Secretary Heller.
I know that she will sign an affidavit...
Jack, not now. Chloe, take the recorder down to processing.
break down the memory chip and see if you can restore anything.
fine.
ms. Hayes? The President's calling for you. Line two.
Mr. President. - Karen, what's this I hear about a conference call you've scheduled with the Attorney General?
is there some problem I should know about?
it's nothing, sir, a mistake. The conference call was canceled.
good, I'm glad to hear that.
listen, the real reason for my call is Jack Bauer.
what about Jack Bauer?
I'm embarrassed to say that after further review, it appears that the evidence against him is, at best, inconclusive.
now, we'll have our lawyers continue to work on it, of course, but for the time being,
I'm suspending the arrest order.
you're dropping the charges against Bauer?
that's correct.
Mr. President, you have had this office, other agencies, and the military dedicate all manpower and resources into apprehending Jack Bauer.
Yes. Based on evidence i initially thought was credible.
and now I have new information that's convinced me that the original intel was faulty.
am I to release Bauer, sir?
I'll leave that to your discretion.
thank you, Karen. Good work.
we'll be in touch.
Yes, Mr. President.
he's letting me go because he knows he's won.
what does he gain by releasing you?
I'll be on my own. Alone, unprotected, a perfect target.
word just came in -- Bierko's escaped.
What?! - How long ago?!
the convoy that was moving him to district was hit about ten minutes ago.
they took out all Davis, on line three.
Davis, Karen Hayes. What happened?
our lead car got taken out by an IED.
I counted six attackers. Bierko got away before I could call in backup.
did you see the vehicle?
negative. I blacked out when I took one in the shoulder.
there's a medevac team on the way.
before I lost consciousness, I overheard Bierko talking to his men.
he said they're not finished.
not finished? - Yes, ma'am,
I'm certain he said something about a nerve gas canister.
did he say anything else?
I'm sorry, Ms. Hayes, that's all I heard.
all right, Davis, stand by. The medical team will be there in a minute.
copy that.
why would Bierko even mention the Sentox? - I don't know.
I assumed all the canisters were destroyed in the explosions at the distribution center.
how many canisters has forensics accounted for?
by the time the fires were put out, there was not enough left to do a full accounting.
damn it.
bill, raise an inter-agency alert.
I need LAPD to do a sweep of the ambush area for witnesses.
I want search helicopters. I want Chloe to have full domain over surveillance satellites.
this is priority one -- we have got to find Vadimir Bierko.
we held one in reserve, just as you ordered...
but I still don't understand why.
we can't do much damage with one canister of nerve gas.
you're so wrong. Let's go.
E-excuse me? Agent...
it's Agent Cole, ma'am.
Cole. I'm sorry, Agent Cole.
my husband said that Aaron Pierce had been transferred to Washington, and this is Agent Pierce's phone.
I was wondering if you'll be so good as to make sure that it's returned to him?
of course.
was there anything else, ma'am?
no.
there's nothing else.
Oh, my god.
I'm sorry about this, Aaron.
listen to me, Aaron.
you think you know what's going on.
I'm here to tell you, you don't.
then why don't you explain it to me, Mr. President?
I understand Jack Bauer led you to believe that there was a recording
something that tied me to David Palmer's murder.
that recording doesn't exist.
that's not what I've been told.
you're not hearing what I'm saying.
the recording doesn't exist.
it's over.
you have a choice here, Aaron.
you are a good man.
you're a fine agent.
I see no reason to throw away your career.
but I need to know that we can put this behind us.
if you'll give me your word that you'll let this drop,
I will make sure that you are reassigned to whatever post you want.
except for the White House, of course.
so...
what's it gonna be, Aaron?
are my terms acceptable?
there is nothing that you have said or done that is acceptable to me in the least.
you're a traitor to this country and a disgrace to your office.
and it's my duty to see that you're brought to justice for what you've done.
is there anything else, Charles?
I know Pierce, Mr. President. Served with him for five years.
and his loyalty is to David Palmer.
believe me when I tell you, he's going to be a problem.
Mr. President. I confess, I didn't expect to hear from you again.
the situation's changed. Everything's under control.
the recording's been destroyed; it's no longer a problem.
that's very good news, Mr. President. But what about the people who've already heard it?
can't do anything without proof.
I don't think any further action needs to be taken.
then can we assume you've got the rest of your house in order?
if by that you mean my wife, yes.
Yes, she's cooperating fully.
as for Aaron Pierce, that's another matter, but, um...
I'm taking care of that.
of course.
what about Jack Bauer?
I've already given Karen Hayes permission to release him, and the arrangements that we discussed about taking him out have already been set in motion.
it appears you have everything well in hand, Mr. President.
Yes, yes. I said I would handle it, and I have.
situation's contained, there's nothing more to worry about.
I'll call you back.
sir. - What is it, Mike?
I just got off the phone with Karen Hayes.
vladimir Bierko has escaped.
what? How?
the caravan transporting him to district was ambushed.
damn it! I thought we rolled CTU into homeland security just to avoid screwups like this.
there's more, sir.
they have reason to believe Bierko might be readying another terrorist attack.
what kind of attack?
well, CTU's working on that now.
I want constant updates. You keep me apprised of the progress.
Yes, sir.
Chloe, any luck?
only the bad kind. None of these satellites were positioned toward the ambush site.
by the time I queued a redirect, Bierko and his men were long gone.
you try Caltrans?
I'm back-streaming now. So far, I've come up dry.
keep trying. We've got to get an ID on the vehicle.
I know.
that was LAPD command. They've combed the area, but they can't find any witnesses.
none?
4: 00 a.m. in the middle of a curfew; there simply wasn't anyone there.
then we have nothing.
we've got Henderson. - What about him?
Henderson set up Bierko with the nerve gas to begin with.
no, we've already been down that road. He won't talk to us, and you know that.
that was about protecting Logan. If Henderson's the patriot he says he is, he's not gonna want those terrorists to succeed.
trust me, you're wasting your time. He's not gonna help us.
he will if we offer him a deal.
that's not gonna happen. - Jack.
no. Not this time. Not this man.
we're running out of options here. This is about saving lives, not indulging a grudge.
you think this is about a grudge? He killed an ex-president of the United States.
he tried to kill the Secretary of Defense.
you want this man to walk with full immunity?
it's not about what anyone wants, it's about doing what has to be done.
nobody knows that better than you.
Bierko is going to kill innocent people. Henderson might be our only chance to stop him.
what would David Palmer want you to do if he were here?
the best way to honor his memory is to make the choice to save others.
obviously, I can't stop you from doing this.
if you're gonna give him a deal, at least let me present it.
all right. - Thank you.
since you're clearly no longer a fugitive, I assume they retrieved that recording.
someone got to it and erased it. I'm not here to talk about the recording.
Bierko escaped about a half an hour ago. He's gonna carry out another attack.
I'm sure he will. You bruised the man's ego when you stopped his first attempt.
you know him. You know how he thinks. You studied him before you set up this deal.
what's he gonna do?
why should I help you?
you call yourself a patriot. Prove it.
these terrorists are gonna attack the country that you love, because you betrayed them.
why don't you help me put out the fire that you started?
they sent you in here to broker a deal, didn't they?
what's the offer, full immunity?
that just must be really eating you up inside.
what do you think?
you were responsible for the murder of people that I cared about.
I am sorry about David Palmer, I am.
but what I did was in the interest of the destiny of this country.
and I'm not talking about the version you read on the op-ed pages pages of the New York Times.
I'm talking about the politics of survival -- the way the world really works.
do you want immunity or not?
immunity is worthless.
Yeah.
that recording was my only immunity.
they give me a piece of paper, I walk out of here, I'm a dead man.
it's two days, two hours, two months, who cares? They're gonna take me down.
who's they?
same people that made walt cummings look like a suicide.
come on, Jack. You can't really believe that Charles Logan masterminded all of this by himself.
give me the names.
you can't touch them.
but they can touch you.
I'll help you catch Bierko. But not for an immunity deal.
I need something more, and you're the only person can make it happen.
what do you want?
to disappear, just like you did so they wouldn't turn you over to the Chinese.
except, I'm not gonna make your mistake.
I'm gonna leave the country, I'm gonna take Miriam with me.
you don't need my help for that.
actually, I do. All of my contacts are still loyal to the President.
I need somebody I can trust to cover our tracks.
I need somebody who can do a better job of it than those incompetents who failed to cover yours.
what makes you think that I'm not gonna kill you the second this is over?
because you're gonna give me your word.
and I know what your word is worth to you. So it's all I need.
XXXXXXXXX
anything less than Bierko's head on a plate, this deal is off.
fine.
now, Bierko is gonna hit hard, so you'd better think fast.
Chloe, do a phone check on these 14 names. I want you working out of the situation room.
XXXXXXXXX. What do we have?
Henderson gave us 14 names that he believes Bierko's gonna contact first.
Chloe's doing a phone check and pulling up relative data.
is tactical standing by? - They're on priority alert.
I put curtis manning in command, if it's all right with you.
I trust your judgment, Bill.
security's getting ready to bring Henderson in here for a debrief.
excuse me for one second.
Jack, I just heard about the recording. Has it really been destroyed?
president Logan managed to get to it. - My god.
we have a more immediate problem.
Bierko. I heard that he escaped. That's why I came back out here.
I was hoping that I could help.
why is Henderson coming out of Holding?
we're using him to help us find Bierko.
Audrey, Karen made a deal.
she gave him immunity.
What?! Jack, how can you let this happen?
you know what that man has done.
we didn't have a choice.
Bierko's our number one priority.
we know he's planning another attack.
without Henderson's help, we won't find him.
I think we've got something.
Audrey, I'm sorry.
I've got to go.
all right , what we have?
out of the 14 names on the list, only one has an active cell phone - Joseph Malina.
joseph Malina's an arms dealer.
used to be a military contractor until they accused him of selling secrets.
but they couldn't prove anything, so he beat all the charges.
you know him?
well enough. I did business with him before and after he was arrested. What do you have on him?
Malina got a 12 second call on his home phone at 4: 03 a.m.
from a pay phone in Van Nuys not far from the ambush site.
a minute later, the same pay phone got a call-back from a GSM Sat phone.
in other words, he took down the number, called from an untraceable line.
sounds like our guy.
tell Curtis to mobilize his tactical team.
hang on, hang on.
what good is that going to accomplish?
you're going to bring Malina in here.
you think he's just going to roll over on Bierko?
he didn't cut a deal when he was busted before, he's not gonna cut a deal now.
and even if you can crack him.
I don't think you can.
you're going to need hours, and you don't have hours.
what do you suggest?
I suggest you send me in to talk to Malina.
I'll find out what Bierko got from him.
I don't think so. Jack, don't be stupid.
you know you can't get anything out of this guy, and his computer makes this place look like an Internet cafe.
he's got the absolute, most sophisticated, state-of-the-art security system, including a Phoenix Shield.
we can get through it.
not a Phoenix. It's a poison pill firewall.
any attempt at circumventing it, and the hard drive does a cold-start erase, at which point, you can forget about retrieving any data.
take him back to holding.
I don't think we have a choice here.
Karen, please, don't do this.
Jack, I know how you feel, but Henderson's right.
we can't afford to gamble on this play.
damn it, Bill, you cannot trust this guy.
I agree.
that's why I'm sending you with him.
I want him under your guard on a tight leash.
if he tries anything, I swear to you,
I will kill him.
then don't let it get to that point.
get in.
adams, listen to me.
you don't have to do this.
Logan isn't worth protecting.
you know that.
he's not going to get away with any of this, and neither will you.
shut up and get in the trunk.
use your head.
Logan wants me dead because he thinks I know too much, that I'm a liability.
how soon before you're just another liability?
what are you doing?
ma'am please stay where you are.
you're going to shoot me?
I'm the First Lady.
you're going to shoot the First Lady?
who are you calling?
Mrs. Logan, this is my last warning.
aaron, stay with me.
Aaron! Oh, God.
Oh, God, Aaron.
Jack, we're coming up on Malina's place.
Curtis, I want you to set up a perimeter.
I want a man at each possible escape route.
you got it. As for you, you got ten minutes.
you don't get the intelligence from Malina by then, we come through the door, and we interrogate him.
I'm gonna tell you again, Jack, interrogating won't work.
this guy won't break. Then you better hope your way does.
get me an audio pack. Undo your shirt.
wait a minute. You can't wire me.
why not? Well, think about it, Jack.
you heard Malina's file.
this guy didn't get where he got by being careless.
he's got a scanner, frequency detector, God knows what else.
the second I walk through that door with a wire, the bells go off, this thing's over.
look, you don't trust me, fine.
and just so we're straight, I don't trust you, either, but neither one of us can afford to blow this operation.
we're all set. Men are in position.
no games, Christopher.
I don't need another reason to put a bullet in your brain.
you got ten minutes.
have CTU in-monitor channel 8.
hold up.
go.
who is it?
what do you want, Chris?
we have to talk.
what, at 4: 30 in the morning?
about Vladimir Bierko.
you don't waste my time, I don't waste your time.
you're going to want to hear what I have to say.
Hey!
what's so important it couldn't wait?
what are you looking for?
is there another way out of here?
what the hell are you talking about?
Jack, I don't like this.
what's Henderson doing?
I don't yet. Maintain your position.
I repeat, maintain your position.
Secure-cache the files.
anything you can't do without.
Why?
because there is an entire phalanx of CTU agents outside, including an ex-agent named Jack Bauer.
he's selling us out, Jack.
now, Bauer is running me.
I cut a deal with him, but I know this guy's gonna kill me first chance he gets.
Curtis, move your team in now.
all teams, move in now!
you bastard, you brought him here!
he was coming here anyway.
so secure the files, crash the system.
stop wasting time, and do it!
give me a weapon.
Freeze!
let me see your hands! Now!
slowly stand up.
put the weapon on the counter.
step back.
Curtis, how are your men?
my men are fine.
I've been hit, but I'm okay.
call in medical; get him transferred back to CTU.
what's Malina's condition?
gunshot to the hip.
he's losing blood.
stabilize him, keep him alive.
I had him, Jack.
30 more seconds was all I needed.
you played me.
this is over; you're going back.
no, you blew it, Jack.
what are you talking about?
I got him to life the firewall, and he was about to dump all of his files onto a flash drive before you jumped the gun and busted in here.
now you're going to waste a hell of a lot of time trying to decrypt those files off a mainframe, so you'd better pray there's something on there you can read.
cuff him.
bill, this is Jack.
get Chloe to open up a channel.
I'm going to send you some files from Malina's computer.
I'm on it, Jack.
Chloe, I need you to access these files, find out which ones were opened in the last ten minutes.
they'll tell us what Malina sold Bierko.
they're coming through now - hang on.
bill, Curtis was hit - he's stable, but I'm having him transported back to CTU.
all right, Jack, I'll tell Medical.
send a chopper over to this location.
as soon as we know what Bierko's target is, we're going to need to move fast.
okay, I got through the firewall.
it's still going to take me some time to decrypt the files.
Chloe, just do it as quickly as you can.
Bierko's going to release the Sentox gas soon.
we need to know where.
there, you should have everything.
let's go.
Charles lied to me.
he said you'd been transferred to Washington.
that agent, um...
my husband ordered him to kill you, didn't he?
Yes, ma'am.
but I'm sorry to tell you...
the president was involved with much worse things than that.
I know.
I was going to let him get away with it... all of it.
I was going to keep quiet.
we have to do something.
I'll hide the body, get him in the trunk, but I can't drive it out of here.
the president has to believe that I'm dead.
I need to lay low, keep out of sight.
I can do it.
no. No. Yes, Aaron, I can drive it.
no, you need to get back inside the residence.
your husband can't suspect that anything has gone wrong.
you need to find Mike Novick.
tell him everything.
and tell him to meet me here.
okay.
aaron, promise me...
promise me that if something goes wrong and you're in danger of getting caught, you will find a way off these grounds, and you will leave.
promise me.
you have my word.
secure him by the tailgate.
bill, it's Jack.
how is Chloe doing with the files?
almost there, Jack.
okay, I got it.
wait, there's something more.
classified defense contracts and plans.
it's a Russian submarine, Jack.
the Natalia-K524, Delta-IV class.
it's here for inspection by our navy.
why is the U.S. Navy inspecting a Russian submarine?
it's part of the treaty that President Logan and President Suvarov signed.
there's a provision that calls for the sharing of technology.
where is it docked?
docking Station 8.
it's a non-military shipyard at the Port of Los Angeles.
I'll deploy TAC teams to the port.
good.
Chloe, hold on.
what's the armament package on a Russian Delta IV-class sub?
best of my knowledge, 12 Scorpion land attack missiles.
are they nuclear?
no, but they're fast and accurate.
carry multiple warheads.
one could take out several city blocks.
uncuff him.
Karen, it's Jack.
are you still there?
Yes, Jack, I'm here.
okay, I need you to put me in touch with the ranking U.S. officer on the Natalia.
we need to get them to lock out their onboard weapons systems!
all right, I'll have Audrey call DOD and open a priority line to the sub, and she'll get back to you.
okay, thank you.
you're coming with me.
I found Bierko's target for you.
the deal was Bierko's head on a plate.
what do you want me to do now - kill him for you?!
the only reason you're going with me is 'cause you know the weapons systems.
get in.
go!
this is Bauer.
Jack, I've got the U.S. Navy's ranking officer on board the Natalia - I'm putting you through.
okay, Audrey, stay on the line.
all right, Jack, hold on.
lieutenant Southern, you're on with Jack Bauer.
agent Bauer, what is this about?
lieutenant, we believe the Natalia has been targeted for a terrorist attack.
you need to secure your vessel and lock down your weapons systems immediately.
call all hands, set Condition Delta, seal the bridge and aft hatches.
aye, sir. You need to put your men on alert.
there's a threat to your submarine.
now, what is the nature of this threat?
we think the terrorists are after your missiles on the sub.
I'm going to check right now.
sailor! I've got that.
report aft.
I'm checking topside.
lieutenant!
damn it, Audrey, I've lost him.
notify DOD.
all right, Jack, I'm on it.
captain, we need to move.
captain, how far out are we?
just over five minutes, sir.
that way.
read me the code we got from Malina.
we have control of the weapons system.
are the missiles loaded?
vertical tubes are loaded and ready.
loading horizontal tubes now.
Curtis! Everyone back !
okay, jack, the hard drive is mostly toast, but I was able to recover the most recently accessed file.
some kind of wiring schematic.
how much of the file do we have?
about a page and a half-- mostly in arabic, some of it russian.
do you know what this is?
it is a list of electronic components for a nuclear device.
hello. - Do you have the package?
not yet, but I'll have it soon.
call me when you have it.
look, I don't want to hurt any of you, but I will, unless you do exactly what I say.
there's a package .
I'm supposed to take it to a man who has an item for you.
when you pick up the item, you'll call me, and I'll give you further instructions.
there it is.
walid, I'm so sorry I got you into this.
I deleted those files. It wasn't right for them to arrest you for my action.
don't touch me.
let him alone!
sir, get back in line! - Not until you let go of that man.
Mr. President.
what do you want?
you are holding 110 so-called enemy combatants at your palmdale military facility.
you must have all these "freedom fighters" on a non-military aircraft in the air by the end of the hour.
if you don't release the prisoners by the deadline, the consequences will be devastating.
Jack, a nuclear device has been diverted to a scientist with known terrorist ties.
I'm pulling up the file now.
do you recognize him?
Yes, I saw him with Fayed a year ago.
his name is Numair-- Hasan Numair.
we need to know where this man is now.
hasan Numair is one of the terrorists being released from palmdale military prison.
prisoner Numair, identify yourself now.
sergeant. Numair is not on the plane.
repeat, Numair is not on the plane.
hurry up. Fayed is waiting for you.
the FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN 9: 00 A. M. AND 10: 00 A. M.
this escape was planned well in advance. - I agree, sir.
Fayed's demand for the release of the prisoners was a ploy.
he never intended for us to fly Numair out of the country.
he wanted him free inside our borders. - That's right, sir.
do we have any idea where along the route Numair actually escaped?
it had to be after the bus got on the highway. He must have had inside help.
is there anyone unaccounted for?
Yes, sir, our sergeant is missing. We're looking for him now.
I'll call you as soon as i have any more information.
Chloe, what about satellite?
we have coverage of the bus numair boarded, but it's not continuous.
there are two tunnels in three locations including this one where the coverage is only partial.
damn it.
Numair is a known terrorist with possible access to suitcase nukes, and he escapes in broad daylight.
we have to do better than we're doing, and we have to do it faster!
what else do we know about this prisoner Numair?
he's a nuclear engineer trained in Germany.
he ran a weapons program out of Frankfurt up until about eight years ago, when he moved to the Middle East.
how relevant is his training to the existing systems?
he knows it all, and he's up to date.
if he gets his hands on the suitcase nuke, he can prep it on site.
I want this at the top of our list.
capturing Numair is our number one priority.
we won't be able to set up satellite parameters. The net's too wide.
Yeah, I know. I know.
partition the grid. Send half to me and the other half to Morris.
Morris? - Just do it.
Yeah, that's because we're monitoring the situation.
as soon as I have anything new on my end, I will share it with you.
Yes.
what are you working on?
Oh, just setting up image processing for caltrans in the area Numair escaped.
dobbins can do that; I need you on something else.
now's not the time to pull rank on me. Chloe has assigned me a task.
please find somebody else.
okay.
Hey, what's Morris doing for you?
what are you talking about?
well, I know he said he's on task for you, but I need help with something.
he's not doing anything for me.
is this a joke? - You're upset.
our alert level is as high as it gets, and you're playing games.
if you can't work with me, then you quit.
the files are on your system. Filter them now.
I will.
so now we have to assume there is a rogue nuclear weapon somewhere on American soil, or there will be soon.
Alagencies are advised to proceed under that assumption.
so what are we dealing with, Karen?
suitcase nukes.
the term refers to a number of devices manufactured by the former Soviet Union.
small enough for one individual to carry, and they have a yield of one kiloton or less.
potential damage?
the kill radius of a typical suitcase nuke is about a half-mile.
the radiation from the blast greatly extends that radius depending on the prevailing winds and other weather conditions.
let's just arrive at the point here, karen. How many casualties are we talking about?
well, that depends on the population density. In a crowded city many thousands would die instantly.
taking the radiation into account, the number of deaths and serious injuries would multiply into the hundreds of thousands.
get me Jack Bauer...
immediately.
there's nothing here; we're wasting our time.
you keep saying "we."
there's you and there's us.
there is no we.
just give it a minute.
anything that isn't fully incinerated could provide us with fingerprints or trace dna.
it's Bauer.
hold for the president, please.
Yes. - Sir, Jack Bauer is on the line.
Mr. President.
I wanted you to know that we're in the process of verifying what Assad told you about his peace initiative.
good.
so far, everything he's told us has been true. He's given us no reason to doubt him.
no, you're right.
listen, I'm also calling because I want you to take charge of the search for Fayed and Numair.
Mr. President, I...
after the way the country treated you this morning, Jack, I...
well...
after the way that I treated you, I know I don't have any right to ask you anything.
but you've been on top of this situation from the start, and I just want to make it official.
Mr. President, the truth is I don't tink I'm up to it.
Jack, we are behind the curve as it is, but if it weren't for your efforts today, we'd be nowhere.
I need you to lead this search.
then I'll do my best, sir.
report to Bill Buchanan at CTU, and call me anytime you think it's necessary.
Yes, Mr. President. - Thank you.
the president wants me to run the search for Fayed and Numair.
I can't do this without your help, Curti
I need you to accept Assad as a part of this investigation.
he knows these people; he knows what to look for. He will see things that you and I would miss.
he knows these people because he's one of them, Jack.
trust me.
we need his help.
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
time was, you would've seen through this guy in a minute.
what did the Chinese do to you?
is there something you need to tell me?
like what?
is there some kind of a history between you and Assad?
they found this.
what is it?
it's a PDA damaged in the blast.
the message is still readable. - What's it say?
visitor arrived on thursday."
the visitor couldn't be Numair. He was still in custody then.
visitor" is a code word used within the cell. It refers to "weapon."
the suitcase nuke.
the message must mean that Fayed received it last thursday.
if they had the weapon last thursday, why do they need to get Numair out of prison now?
he must be key to making the device operational.
get everything packed up. We need to go. Move.
nothing is more important than finding Fayed and Numair.
you understand me?
Yeah.
O'Brian. - Chloe, it's Jack.
I want you to run a cross-check on Curtis manning and Assad.
is this important, Jack? I got a lot on my plate right now.
Curtis has a problem with Assad, it's personal.
I don't know what it is, but I need to get them to work together, Chloe-- please.
I'll get it as soon as I can.
Numair is here.
my brother. - Fayed.
I was starting to worry. - Yes.
the escape went as planned, but I had to be careful crossing the city.
where is it?
this was the last model the Soviets produced.
where are the tools?
you are missing what I need to reprogram the trigger.
the device will be here soon. - By what means?
young man named Ahmed-- recent recruit but reliable.
ahmed, we have known you and your family for so long.
I can't believe you want to be doing this.
it's not what i want to do. It's what i have to do-- I am a soldier.
you said your father knows nothing of this.
when he finds out, will he be proud?
Yes. - Ahmed, I have what you want.
good, now you're going to deliver it to a man named Fayed...
no.
what?
no, I'm not going to deliver it anywhere until you let my family go.
ray, do what I say, or I will shoot them.
well, then i will destroy it, and I have a feeling the people you're working for will be very disappointed.
listen to me... - no, you listen to me!
I just killed a man for this package, and I'm not going to deliver it anywhere until I know my family is safe.
I'll release one of them. - Both of them.
if I do that I have no leverage, and you know it.
decide now-- which one do I release?
my son, release my son.
I will release your wife.
I just told you to release my son.
you just told me who you value most.
your wife will call you when she's clear of the house.
deliver the component and then I will release your son.
that's it, Ray. Don't push your luck.
all right.
all right, let her go.
get in the car and drive.
then call Ray and tell him that you're all right.
this is the number that he called from. Will you remember this?
Yes. - Good.
tell him to call me when you're through.
and understand that if I see any police, I will shoot Scott, do you understand?
I love you.
go!
Jilli, are you all right? - I'm fine.
what about Scott? - He's still with Aed.
he says that if we go to the police, he's going to kill Scott.
but do you think that even if we do he says that he would...
you think he'll still kill Scott when this is over?
I don't know, but we cannot take the chance of going to the police.
we have to handle this ourselves. - Oh, God, Ray, I don't know.
look, I'm going to deliver the package like ahmed said. He already let you go.
so we have to tell ourselves that he's got no reason to kill Scott.
look, I'm going to call Ahmed back. Do not call the police.
okay.
honey, I love you.
I love you.
hello.
ahmed, I heard from Jillian. - Good.
take the package to 351 old mill road, Valencia. Do you know where that is?
351... i can find it.
all right, I will call Fayed and tell him to expect you instead of me.
call me when you get there. It should not take you longer than 30 minutes.
if it does... - I understand. I'm leaving now.
you've reached 911, the lapd emergency line.
a terrorist is holding my son hostage. I need to speak to the police.
damn it, Morris, I didn't want this tab delimited. I wanted it in tables like I told you.
I work much faster with tabs. I thought that is what you'd want.
you know that's not what I wanted. You're just being a pain in the ass.
you know what, nobody speaks to me like this.
you know what, I just did, so what? Why don't you sit down and get back to work.
this has got to stop.
everyone is extremely busy, and you two are distracting everyone around you.
if you can explain to me how to get him to follow directions...
following directions-- that's what you call this power trip you're on?
excuse me.
we all know what this is about.
Milo, you and I dated a couple of times before Morris and i got back together.
we saw a couple of good movies, but we both agreed that it wasn't really happening.
Yeah.
and you...
so I dated Milo a couple of times?
but I chose you.
so why don't you get over it and stop trying to beat him up?
you think this is about my insecurities?
Yeah, isn't it?
no.
okay, fine, if you want it in table format, you'll get it in table format.
let's just stop this mad, psychotic, terrorist bad guy before he detonates a nuke on wilshire boulevard, all right?
thank you.
sorry about that, Milo.
and just for the record, there's no lingering jealousy about any films you two may have seen together.
no problem.
this is Bauer. - Jack, it's Bill.
the police just vetted a call from a woman who claims her son is being held by terrorists.
is she credible? - I'm not sure yet.
she says she was held, too, for a couple of hours, but she got out somehow.
is she on the line? - Yes, her name is Jillian Wallace.
patch her through.
ms. Wallace, this is Bill Buchanan. I'm transferring you to one of our men in the field.
Hello? - Ms. Wallace, my name is Jack Bauer.
you said your son is being held by a terrorist?
Yes, and he's forcing my husband to deliver a package.
what kind of package? - I-I don't know.
there are other people involved.
what's the name of the man holding your son?
did he mention any other names?
Yes, one-- Fayed.
ma'am, how do we reach your husband?
you can'.t He isn't carrying a cell phone.
do you know where he was taking the package?
no. I'm sorry.
whatever you do, just don't let them hurt my son.
ms. Wallace, we're going to do everything we can. Just stay away from the house and we'll get back to you.
what do you think, Jack?
she knew Fayed's name. What's the location?
northeast corner of channing and 15th, Granada hills.
Where's your nearest tac team?
they're spread out all over the city. You're as close as anybody. Take your team with you.
copy that.
we have a lead?
hostage situation in Granada hills.
they think it might be connected to the bombings. We need to go to 15th and channing.
we can't take him on a tactical mission.
we might need him when we get there.
all teams, proceed to 15th and channing, Granada hills.
Mr. President.
it's good to see you again, Mr. Ambassador.
and you, sir. - Please, sit.
how do you do? - Karen Hayes.
how do you do? - Tom Lennox.
the events of these past few weeks are deeply distressing for all of us.
if there's anything we can do to help, please tell me.
you can help right now, Mr. Ambassador, by having a very candid conversation with us.
I'm always candid, Mr. President.
Mr. Ambassador, we've been in contact with Hamrial-Assad.
we know that he has been the driving force behind a number of terrorist attacks around the country...
around the world for the past two decades.
I know who he is.
assad claims he's renounced terrorism, Mr. Ambassador.
says he's willing to negotiate. To use political means to gain his ends.
now, do you think he's telling the truth?
I have reason to believe that he is telling the truth.
but how much influence does he have? Does he speak for a large number of terrorist organizations?
as you know, there are literally hundreds of such groups.
but Assad's reputation is such that many of them...
not all by any means-- but a substantial number
would follow his lead at least for a while.
so this really could be a significant step towards peace?
I sincerely hope so.
thank you, Mr. R.Ambassador.
you've been extremely helpful. - You're welcome, Mr. President.
so this corroborates everything Jack told us about Assad.
we need to formalize our relationship with him now. Lock him into cooperation.
I have a problem forming a partnership with a man who is responsible for the deaths of so many innocents.
is Assad still with Jack Bauer? - Yes, sir.
let's getJack on the phone, please.
Bauer. - Hold for the president, please.
Jack? - Yes, Mr. President.
do we have any leads on that nuclear weapon yet?
we have one. We're following it up now. It's too early to tell if it's going to be meaningful.
all right, Jack, listen, I just had a meeting that confirms Assad is serious about pursuing this negotiated peace.
and that he does in fact, have the influence with his own people to make that happen, so I would like to come to some sort of arrangement with him. Is he with you now?
Yes, sir. - Let me speak with him, please.
one moment.
the president wants to speak to you.
Yes, Mr. President.
Mr. Assad, I am prepared to offer you full protection and a pardon for all crimes or acts of war in the past.
there are conditions, however.
that you continue tracking Abu Fayed, and that you pledge your commitment to establishing a broader peace.
is that acceptable to you?
in principle, yes.
forgive me, Mr. President, but I need to see this in writing.
you'll have it within the hour.
let me speak with Jack, please.
of course.
Yes, sir.
this was not an easy thing to do, Jack, but I do believe the greater good requires it.
do you agree?
I'm glad it's a call I didn't have to make, sir.
thank you, Jack. - Yes, sir.
your president-- do you believe he is an honorable man?
Yes, I do.
Mr. Lennox, excuse me, I have Sandra Palmer calling for the president, but he's on another line.
could you transfer that call to my cell phone, please?
she specifically asked to speak to the president.
and do it now, please.
Yes, Sandra, Tom Lennox here.
I need to speak with Wayne. It's important.
I'm afraid the president's all tied up at the moment.
will you please let him know that I'm on the phone?
well, actually the president has asked not to be disturbed. Does this, by any chance, concern your friend Walid?
Yes, that's exactly what it's about. He's still in custody.
you continue to arrest innocent people, you're giving the terrorists exactly what they want.
with all due respect, the president is more concerned with the fate of the country than the fate of one man, Sandra, so...
an innocent man jailed without charges.
if you believe the fundamental principles of this country, there is nothing more important than that.
well, you've got the makings of a splendid law review article there and I will pass this message along to the president.
if you'll excuse me, please.
Mr. Lennox, pass along another message as well.
what is that, Sandra?
I will do whatever it takes to protect my client.
if it embarrasses the administration, so be it.
do I detect a threat here?
Yes, and so is this
I am holding you personally responsible for whatever happens to Walid.
is tre someplace I can get a drink of water?
brother.
thank you.
thank you for helping me earlier.
no problem.
did you tell them anything?
of course not.
good.
I'll tell you something, brother.
before this day is over, they'll all pay.
what do you mean?
salim, what are you doing?
it's all right. He's a friend.
okay, take, take it easy.
I got package from Ahmed, okay? Ahmed.
who is this?
he says Ahmed sent him.
your name? - Ray Wallace.
ahmed should have called you and told you I was coming.
you have to call Ahmed and tell him to let my son go, because we had a deal.
be quiet.
is this what you need to reprogram the trigger?
Yes, this should work.
how long will it take to complete assembly?
20 minutes.
so in a little less than an hour it will detonate and strike a blow that the Americans will never forget.
you're insane.
don't kill him until you're ready to leave.
he still may be of some use as a bargaining chip if something goes wrong.
look, my son...
he, he's just a boy.
could you please call Ahmed and just tell him let him go? I mean, I've done everything I've been asked to. Please.
I may, if you remain cooperative.
I will, I swear.
I still have much to do, as you know.
I have everything I need.
when you're finished, meet me at the safe house.
Yes.
ahmed, it's me.
did the device arrive?
Yes, but it was still wrong to involve anyone else.
I understand and I know, but I had to. I had no choice.
never mind. It arrived. That's what counts.
you have a hostage. This man's son.
Yes.
you have no further use for him?
no.
then leave, join the others.
but before you go, kill the boy.
is that necessary?
Yes, he's seen and heard too much.
you understand?
Yes, Fayed.
pardon for Assad looks satisfactory. Tell the attorney general to proceed.
Yes.
Mr. Lennox and miss Hayes are here. - Oh, show them in.
I just approved the written agreement with Assad.
that was quick. - It had to be.
we don't have the time to stand on ceremony.
Tom, I know you disapprove of this agreement, but you have got to put that behind you.
the issue now is how do we position this with the public.
it must be kept from the public.
that's not practical, Tom.
word will leak out. It's to our advantage to make it known that Assad is on our side.
then don't disclose the formal agreement, don't use the words "pardon" or "amnesty."
we're "cooperating." - I agree.
let's portray assad as a man who's not a terrorist, but someone who's renounced terrorism and wants peace.
Terrorist-turned-statesman.
he's not the first. The point is saving lives. That needs to be our focus here.
okay, so for every life that was lost in the past, because of this man, ten more may be saved in the future by working with him.
all right, well, on the face of it, the logic is compelling.
all right, let's make a set of briefing points and get them to our media people.
I'm on it.
I do have to say, Mr. President,
I still don't like this.
I understand.
and it makes me appreciate your loyalty all the more, Tom.
the Wallace kid's still being held hostage.
copy that.
Curtis, you and your team, you take the back of the house.
you come with me. We'll find an entrance point from the side.
we'll go on my command. This is Jack Bauer to all personnel.
it is imperative we take this suspect alive.
right now, he's our best chance of finding the nuke. Slowly move into positions now.
the yard is clear. Cover me.
why aren't you talking?
what's going on?
did my father deliver the package?
Yes. - Is he okay?
did he do exactly what you told him?
your father's fine.
so...
then you can let me go, too.
get up.
what?
get up!
Why?
my father did exactly what you told him to do!
I swear! I...
I promise you I won't tell anybody what I know!
Scott, don't make this any harder than it is. Kneel down.
I can't see what's happening in the house. Does anybody have a visual on the situation inside?
not yet. My men are almost in position.
turn around. - You don't have to do this.
turn around now!
set.
all teams are set. - Curtis, make the call.
I'm sorry, Scott.
go!
Freeze!
he's coming your way, Jack!
drop the weapon!
hold your fire!
is he alive?
barely. Get the EMT up here now!
I need him conscious enough to tell us where he made the boy's father take the package!
get me an EMT down here now.
I-I... might know.
when, when he was on the phone with my father, he told him to take something to an address.
um, um, 351 old mill road, Valencia.
bill, it's Jack. I think we've got an address. 351 old mill road, Valencia.
got it.
Nadia, alert the two tac teams. We have a strike target. Deploy them there.
you are going to save my dad?
we're going to do everything we can.
here are the satellite downloads to Fayed's location.
they're only from the past ten minutes, but nobody entered or exited.
what's the exterior layout?
favorable. Tac teams can approach without being seen.
Nadia, get me the president.
we just don't have enough specifics to go public.
but I still want all first response teams in the Los Angeles area to be briefed on the possibility of a nuclear detonation.
excuse me, Mr. President. You have an urgent call from Bill Buchanan.
I'll take it.
Mr. President, we have some good news.
we believe with a high level of probability that we've found the suitcase nuke.
where?
in Valencia, 20 miles north of the city.
tactical teams will be there in 15 minutes.
would you like me to patch you into that feed when it's available, sir?
absolutely, Bill. Good work.
thank you, Mr. President.
I'll let you know when the feed comes up.
um, can we have a mome alone, please?
I'm getting you out of here.
I'm not going anywhere. - Yes, you are.
Sandra, listen to me.
I think some people in this place have a connection with the terrorist attacks.
how would you know that?
they were speaking Arabic, which I don't understand, but there was one phrase they used several times:
pass that on to the FBI or somebody. It, it may help.
they're being held illegally.
any statements they make may not be in their best...
damn it, Sandra, stop being a wyer for one damned minute!
these guys may be planning something that will harm a lot of people.
all right, I'll pass it on.
I have to get back.
be careful.
Yeah, I just got it. Thanks, Bill.
let me know as soon as the TAC teams arrive in Valencia.
this represents everything that you and the president talked about.
you will receive a full pardon in exchange for your continued efforts in helping us stop these attacks, and for bringing your political organization to a negotiated peace with the west.
I need a moment to look through this, please.
I understand.
unfortunately, I need to get back to work. Agent Boorman will take you to CTU.
good luck.
thank you.
excuse me.
what's the document?
come here.
I wanted to talk to you about this before it was executed. I didn't think it would happen this fast.
we made a deal with Assad.
who's "we"?
the united states government, personally authorized by the president.
assad will receive a pardon, in exchange for his full cooperation, which he has given us.
in other words, he walks?
like I told the president, it's not my call.
it's not your call, either. The responsibility lies with him alone.
it's out of our hands.
all right.
if that's the way it has to be...
that's the way it has to be.
Yeah.
Scott! Oh, god!
are you all right? - I'm fine.
are you sure? - Yeah.
are you? - Yes.
Mrs. Wallace.
is there any word on my husband?
with your son's help, we think we know where he is. We've got agents ten route.
is he all right? - We don't know yet.
as soon as they get there, I promise you we'll do everything we can to protect him.
excuse me for one second.
this is Bauer.
Jack, you were right about Curtis and Assad having a past connection.
go on.
Curtis was in the army just after desert storm.
his squad was ambushed by assad's people.
they killed five of curtis's men, and took two more hostage.
Curtis was badly wounded; he couldn't go after them.
the next day a tape was sent to the local television station.
assad's lieutenant forced the men from curtis's patrol to beg for their lives, and then personally beheaded them both.
Oh, my god.
I-I'll get back to you.
Where's agent Manning?
he was here just a second ago.
Boorman. Go ahead, I got him.
still don't remember?
special forces battalion.
32nd support group.
Curtis, put your weapon down!
I can't do that, Jack.
by order of the president of the united states, put down your weapon!
stay out of this, Jack! I can't.
I gave him my word that we would protect him.
I didn't.
Curtis, please, don't do this.
please.
I can't let this animal live.
yeah?
Jack, it's Bill.
Sprague told me what happened.
Curtis didn't leave you any choice.
that's what I keep trying to tell myself.
you did the right thing. We need Assad alive.
he's on his way back-- I think you should come in, too.
tell the president I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore.
the hell you can't!
we're gonna find that suitcase nuke because of you, Jack.
you've done great work today.
good, then you don't need me anymore.
tell me where you are, Jack. I'll send a car for you; we'll talk.
I'm done.
yes?
Mr. Buanan, I just received word that Ahmed Amar, the terrorist who held the Wallace family hostage, died ten route to the hospital.
thank you, Nadia.
Mr. Buchanan, the TAC team is ready.
patch me in. Make sure the white house is connected to the feed.
how much longer?
almost finished. Just need to reconnect the fuse.
I think I saw someone out there. - Who?
the police, somebody-- I saw something.
are you done? - Yes.
can you detonate now? - Yes.
do it now! Do it!
no...
No!
Oh, my god.
alert all first response teams in Los Angeles and the surrounding counties.
let's put them in touch with the military.
tell them...
tell them the resources of the entire nation are at their disposal-- whatever it is they need.
Yes, Mr. President.
Mr. Buchanan, I just got a message from the FBI.
they said it's important.
it's some Arabic phrase. - What is it?
someone overheard a conversation in one of the detention centers.
this phrase kept coming up-- I'm not sure about the pronunciation.
it means "five visitors."
assad said "visitor" was a codeword for "weapon."
there are four more of these things out there.
this was the last model the Soviets produced.
is this what you need to reprogram the trigger?
Yes.
so, in a little less than an hour it will detonate and strike a blow that the Americans will never forget.
when you're finished, meet me at the safe house.
I think some people in this place have a connection with the terrorist attacks.
how would you know that?
there was one phrase they used several times.
pass that on to the FBI.
I've just approved the written agreement with Assad.
I am prepared to offer you full protection and a pardon for all crimes or acts of war in the past.
is that acceptable to you?
I need to see this pardon in writing.
Jack, you were right about Curtis and Assad having a past connection.
Curtis was in the army just after desert storm.
his squad was ambushed by Assad's people.
they killed five of Curtis' men and took two more hostage.
assad's lieutenant personally beheaded them both.
Oh, my god.
you still don't remember?
special forces battalion.
Curtis, put your weapon down!
stay out of this, Jack!
I can't.
I gave him my word that we would protect him.
I can't let this animal live.
Curtis didn't leave you any choice, Jack.
that's what I keep trying to tell myself.
we're going to find that suitcase nuke because of you, Jack.
tell the president I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.
Mr. President, we believe we found the suitcase nuke.
the tac team is ready.
no...
I just got a message from the FBI.
it's some Arabic phrase.
it means "five visitors."
assad said "visitor" was a code word for "weapon."
four more of these things out there.
the following takes place between 10: 00 A. M. And 11: 00 A. M.
over. These are the first images from the latest terrorist attack here in Valencia.
and
judging from the direction of the smoke,
my god.
how many people died in this?
no less than 12, 000.
Mr. President, I just got off the phone with Bill Buchanan at CTU.
he has intel that four more tactical nuclear weapons were stolen along with the one that went off.
do we have any idea where they are?
we do not.
I want a meeting with the joint chiefs, Tom, right away.
I've already let them know.
has civilian air traffic been shut down?
Yes.
the FAA gave the order as soon as they were informed about the bomb.
Mr. President, given the current situation, we've decided to move you down to the bunker.
all right.
but, Tom, I have to get in front of the American people.
Ellen, I want to make a televised speech within the hour.
Yes, sir.
all right, let's go, Dan.
the department of emergency services and public safety have urged everyone to return home. Have we heard from any of the secondary teams that were converging on Fayed?
no, we lost communication as soon as the blast hit.
Milo, can you get a visual?
I just checked the satellite. All...
all of our field teams were too close to ground zero.
they're all dead.
Morris, what was the last thing you heard from them?
they were engaged with the hostiles.
which means they were closing in on Fayed.
we need to know if he was in the radius when the bomb went off.
Absolutely.
Mr. President, your office has been prepared.
the continuity of operations plan has also been activated.
the vice president has been alerted and is following protocol.
the joint chiefs and most of the cabinet members are on their way here.
the remaining cabinet members are being routed to site-R.
right this way, sir.
yeah?
are you all right?
we're upwind of the blast.
we're fine.
what's going on over there?
the secret service moved us down to the bunker and the president is about to meet with the joint chiefs
do you have anything new?
here's what we know:
the bomb went off as we were moving in on Fayed's safe house.
do you think their presence prompted the detonation?
it could have.
it's possible they were just prepping the bomb in Valencia and hoping to move it to a more populated area.
is there any chance that Fayed could still be alive and have those four other bombs?
we don't know.
we're running the intel now.
what about Assad?
he's on his way here.
we're hoping he can help us find Fayed.
all right, keep me in the loop. And, Bill, please be careful.
I will.
it's a lot to process.
so many people.
Yeah.
and Curtis...
I can't believe this.
I know you and he were friends.
why do people I know keep dying?
did you find anything out about Fayed?
no, we're still positioning satellites.
we don't know where he is yet.
we've got massive packet loss.
do you want to help me boot up routers?
who wouldn't?
open etudes five.
okay.
I just have a really bad feeling about everything.
did you know Jack quit?
Yeah, buchanan said he's off channel.
what's that all about?
I'm sure it's because he was forced to kill Curtis.
you know I'm here for you, right?
Yeah, I do.
the authorities discovered our location.
the bomb never reached its target.
damn it, Fayed.
I sold those weapons to you.
the least you could've done was warn me before you blew them up in my city.
I told you it was not supposed to happen the way it happened.
little late for apologies, don't you think?
my engineer died in the blast.
the device used to reprogram the trigger was destroyed as well.
and that's my problem, why?
I have four more bombs whose triggers need to be made operational.
sorry, Fayed.
I'm going to Vegas.
find me a way, Mccarthy.
I'll pay you more.
double the amount from our previous transaction.
that's interesting.
you need someone who can replicate what that device did with modern equipment.
we're talking pretty advanced stuff.
I'd have to do some checking.
do you know someone who can do this?
even if I found someone who can, I doubt they will.
this is over the line.
I don't care how you get them to comply.
I need someone within the next few hours.
are you in or not?
I'll do some research and get back to you.
help! Somebody, help!
look, I can't get through to 911!
would you help?
I need a doctor!
I need a doc...
I need a doctor!
I...I need a doctor!
please, our helicopter, it went down.
and there are two others: One's dead, one's unconscious.
I don't know what to do.
please!
please help me.
show me.
I don't even remember anything hitting us.
things just went out of control.
you were hit by a shockwave.
a shockwave of what?
nuclear bomb.
what?
what are you talking about?
can you hear me?
can you hear me?
Chuck, is that you?
Yeah, yeah, I brought help.
we're gonna get you out of there.
careful, it's about to fall.
it's jammed.
you ready?
one, two, three, go!
stay here.
are you okay?
I think so.
this guys says it's a nuclear bomb.
that's Valencia-- that's where I live.
my wife and kids are there. I got to go...
you can't go back to Valencia.
the radiation will kill you.
Jeff, don't! You'll die!
this is Jack Bauer.
let me speak to Bill Buchanan.
if you want to save your friend, don't let him go back home.
Jack, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
where are you?
I'm still in Granada Hills.
good. You're upwind of the blast.
don't go any further north.
how bad is it?
it took out a one-mile radius.
do we know if this was Fayed's endgame?
it wasn't-- there are four more nukes out there.
you need to pick me up.
you said you were out.
not after this.
all right.
tell me where you are. I'll send a car.
I'm on the corner of Glasgow and 15th.
we'll be there.
Colonel, Fayed has to be at least partially state-supported.
have your guys identified a country?
not yet, sir.
uh, CIA has narrowed down the list.
it's on your screen in the short brief section.
have you been in touch with the ambassadors of these countries?
Yes, sir.
they all extend their condolences and have, of course, disavowed any role in the attacks.
well, we know at least one of them's lying.
maybe all of them.
I'm not sure we know that, John.
but let's say it is true-- what are you suggesting?
we have carriers on standby in the Persian Gulf.
they have the capability of striking multiple targets in each of these states.
we've been playing games with these terrorists for 11 weeks now.
the only language they understand is force.
so let's speak it to them real clearly.
I guarantee you that if each of these countries had to sustain three major metropolitan nuclear strikes they'd no longer have the time or the resources to play in our sandbox anymore.
these people want to live in the stone age-- I say let's put them there.
Admiral, I am very sure that your emotions are shared by many in this room and across this country...
these are not just emotions.
our duty demands we defend...
the president is talking, Admiral.
do not interrupt.
we will retaliate, Admiral.
but we will do so, sir, carefully and with our sights locked on our enemy and only our enemy.
Karen, what has CTU learned about the remaining weapons?
they're assessing the initial satellite intel and forensic data.
so what do we know?
we're assuming that the bomb was meant to be detonated in a more populated area and was only being assembled in Valencia.
by the scientist that I released.
Yes.
the scientist was killed in the blast, and CTU is trying to determine where Fayed was at the time.
the worst-case scenario is that he is still alive and in possession of the remaining nuclear weapons.
tell them we're safe.
that we're moving away from it now.
Mr. Buchanan, this is Hamri Al-Assad.
Mr. Buchanan's director of CTU.
Mr. Buchanan, I know that you see me as your enemy.
but today...
I assure you I am not.
follow me.
there.
all right?
why are we going out of our way treating Assad, one of the most violent terrorists of our time, like a vip?
no holding room.
audience with the White House?
sure.
how would you like your mineral water, Mr. Assad, room temp?
please have a seat.
ready?
bill Buchanan, director of CTU, Los Angeles.
I'm here with Hamri Al-Assad.
less than 30 minutes ago, Abu Fayed detonated a nuclear weapon in Los Angeles.
we have reason to believe he's still at large with four more tactical nuclear weapons in his possession.
four?
that's right.
please, you must understand.
I came to the United States to stop Fayed
I knew he intended to inflict damage, but I did not know he was in possession of nuclear weapons.
but he is.
which means there has to be a trail.
there had to have been many people involved in the planning of this.
this attack was planned after Fayed betrayed me six months ago.
when he learned of your intention to broker a peace plan?
which I still intend to do.
but you knew Fayed was coming to the United States.
this information came to me only days before the first attacks began.
from whom?
I am a well-informed man, Mr. Buchanan.
are there any other paths you can think of that can lead us to Fayed?
Yes.
the source.
the source of the bomb.
about a year ago I sent Fayed to negotiate with an ex-Soviet general about the cache of tactical nuclear weapons.
but there was no transaction at the time.
what was the name of the general?
can you tell me anything about Gredenko?
nothing.
nothing.
I've never met the man.
continue questioning him.
I'm gonna check this out.
you got that, Chloe?
Yeah, I'm opening a Russian database now.
let me know what you find out, Chloe.
wait a minute, what about this file here with Gredenko's name on it?
it's a link we're using as a match bas, Milo.
mind your own business.
I know, I understand that.
I just compiled a list of names, people in L. A.who had contact with Gredenko on business channels.
that's a lot of names.
Yes.
but one of them kind of floated to the top, if you know what I mean.
put it on Buchanan's screen.
Yes, yes, they'll fly him up.
all right.
Morris just put something on your B window.
Gredenko contacts.
good.
look at number 17.
chairman of BXJ Technologies.
Jack's father.
did you get anything more specific?
no.
BXJ does a lot of business in Eastern Europe.
this could be a purely coincidental linkage.
Yeah, what if it's not?
most of their contracts are highly confidential, but I'll look into it.
you calling Jack?
Yeah.
this is Bauer.
assad just gave us the name of a Russian general Fayed contacted a year ago about the nukes.
the general's name is Gredenko.
do you know him?
no.
it turns out your father does.
my father?
are you sure?
Yeah, Gredenko did business with BXJ Technologies, specifically with your father.
what kind of business?
we don't know.
that's why we want to talk to him.
bill, I don't understand-- is my father a suspect?
no. His name came up on a list of people who have had contact with Gredenko.
we're gonna question him.
I wanted to check with you first to see if you could shed any light.
I haven't spoken to him for over nine years.
all right, well, we'll send someone over to talk to him.
bill, wait.
I should do this.
Jack, we can run this.
you don't have enough time.
he'll talk to me if I go alone.
are you sure?
Yeah.
all right, tell Stokes we'll pick him up-- you take the car.
let me know what you find out.
Thanks, Bill.
you need to pull over.
Anacosita Detention Faculty Washington, D.C.
Yes, he is, but I don't know exac...
the FBI's here.
I got to go.
why did they send you?
believe me, Miss Palmer, I didn't want to arrest you or your friend.
this is agent Jennings.
he'll be working this with me.
well, what exactly will you be doing?
walid overheard some conversations about the bombs.
he heard a fragment of a conversation.
if there is an active cell inside that detention facility, we need Walid to find out more.
agent Jennings will be putting a wire on him.
putting a wire on him?
I thought you were gonna be replacing him with an undercover operative.
walid isn't trained to do something like this.
well, he's already in place.
he's established a confidence.
how will you be putting a wire on him?
just...
let us do our job.
have you heard anything more?
about what?
about what's going on out there.
well, how would I know that?
I thought...
I was just wondering if you...knew anything.
no more than you, my brother.
I'm sorry, I have to get back.
sure.
yes?
you and I have to talk.
about what?
you don't ask the questions, you son of a bitch.
I do.
get out.
get out!
we know who you're involved with.
I told your people, I work for the IAA.
I'm not involved in any kind of terrorist activities.
you're lying!
I'm no terrorist.
you're lying!
what's he doing to him?
what do you know?
don't worry. He's not going to hurt him.
it's just for show.
that doesn't sound like it's just for show.
miss Palmer, I advised you to leave.
if you want to stay, keep your comments to yourself.
you're gonna explain to us what we found in your wallet.
what are you talking about?
you know damn well what we're talking about!
he's wiring you.
it's a two-way radio.
now, you're gonna tell me what we found in your wallet.
you understand me?
what do you know about this guy?
this is ridiculous.
what do you know about this guy? -Sit down.
tell me now, or I'll take you to the interrogation room.
you don't want that.
I'm not telling you anything.
I don't care what you do to me.
you will.
you're gonna say that I asked about this man.
you gotta make them believe you're working for them.
I'll be back for you.
what did they do to you?
nothing.
I'm fine.
they think they can do anything to us, those bastards.
we've got a clear signal.
hello.
Sam, is that you?
Yes.
who's this?
it's Jack.
how are you, Sam?
we thought you were...
where are you calling from?
I'm in Los Angeles.
listen, Sam, I need to speak to my father.
it's really important. Is he there?
no, he's not.
where is he?
he left yesterday without telling me where he was going.
I haven't heard from him since.
can I reach him on his cell?
he left it here.
I must admit, it's all a bit mysterious.
I tried calling your brother.
he didn't know either.
where is Gray?
well, he was at work earlier, but who knows now?
can I get his cell number?
Yeah.
okay, I got it.
Sam, listen to me.
if you speak to my father, tell him to get back to me at this number.
did it show up on your screen?
Yes.
it's really important.
I hope you find your father soon.
I know he would want to talk with you. He regrets the way things ended between the two of you.
Yeah, me, too.
well, Jack.
Thanks, Sam.
Yeah.
it's Liddy.
you'll never guess who just called here.
who?
your brother, Jack.
what are you talking about? Jack's rotting away in some Chinese prison.
no, actually he's here in L. A.
how the hell did that happen?
I don't know.
what does he want?
he's looking for the old man.
Yeah, why?
he didn't say.
but if I were you, I'd expect a call from Jack.
your name came up.
damn it, we should have killed Jack when we had the chance instead of handing him over to the Chinese.
we tried.
this isn't good.
my brother has a way of diging things up that need to stay buried.
hello.
it's me, Jack.
Yeah.
Sam said you called, but I didn't believe him.
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
is everyone safe over there?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're, we're cool, Jack.
it's blowing my mind hearing from you like this.
listen, I want you to know that when dad and I found out that you were in China, we tried everything to get you out.
we called in a lot of favors.
Thanks.
Yeah.
how, how did you get out?
some sort of exchange.
yeah? For what?
I'm not really sure.
it must have been one hell of an exchange.
listen, Gray, I'm working with CTU right now.
I'm trying to help them out with something.
Yeah, uh, Sam said that you were, uh, you were trying to find dad?
Yeah. Where is he?
I don't know.
he took off yesterday without saying where he was going.
I assume he went to visit one of his girlfriends.
he's got a few of them, you know.
one of them's really kind of hot, if you can believe that.
why did he leave without his cell phone?
I guess he just didn't want to be bothered.
gray, I need your help.
I need to find him.
it's important.
Yeah, whatever you need, Jack.
I'll make a few phone calls.
can I get back to you at this number?
Yeah.
okay.
you got it.
Thanks.
Chloe, it's Jack.
I need you to help me find an address.
Whose?
your brother?
Yeah.
it should be in my family file.
I haven't seen him in years.
is he still in Malibu?
no, he's in Indian Falls.
226 Pine Crest Road.
do you want his cell phone number?
no.
I already have it.
I just talked to him.
well, why didn't you ask him where he lives?
I'll get back to you.
california highway patrol wants to make clear that it is essential their emergency personnel be allowed to reach those injured in Valencia.
so keep the streets clear.
once again, a nuclear bomb has gone off in Valencia.
the president will address the nation...In a half hour.
you and your mom doing okay?
Yeah.
I mean, on the news they're talking about nuclear fallout.
we'll be fine.
look, you know, we're actually safer now.
they've made their big show in L. A.with this nuke.
whatever's gonna happen next, I'm sure it's gonna be in another city.
okay?
Yeah.
Josh, I need to talk to your mom alone.
for a minute.
all right.
I just got off the phone with my brother, Jack.
how?
I thought the Chinese were holding him.
he's back in Los Angeles.
it's impossible.
apparently not.
he's looking for dad.
is he coming here?
Why?
are you hoping he will?
don't go there, Gray.
we're already there.
I'm just looking for a little honesty.
you weren't over Jack when we got married, and you're still not.
okay, how's this for a little honesty?
insecurity in a grown man is not attractive.
the latest terrorist incident?
this was a nuclear bomb.
can we call it what it is?
we thought it would give the president a little more flexibility.
once you mention the word "nuclear," they're not gonna hear anything else.
no, actually, Ellen, they will hear the truth.
everybody in this country knows what happened today.
and now they're looking for reassurances that no matter how ugly this thing is, the president is in charge.
listen, we don't have any tangible leads and confidence is low.
now, if I go out there and I lie to the American public and tell them that we're on top of this, and then some other bomb goes off somewhere...
they won't believe a single word I say.
that can't happen.
I agree, sir, and that's why I see an oortunity here.
opportunity?
this bomb is going to remove any remaining doubt that we should be taking more aggressive measures, suspension of certain freedoms.
Internment, deportation.
now is the time to start hitting those topics.
Tom, you are counseling that we embrace the politics of fear.
I am saying that we embrace reality.
we are afraid, but if fear consolidates public support for measures that save our nation from extinction, then you bet, I'm in support of fear.
Tom, the people cannot be any more afraid than they are now.
I would like this message to have a calming effect.
Yes, we will call this a nuclear bomb, because that is what it is, but if we expect civil order on those streets, we cannot stoke the panic.
we're not gonna mention policy in this speech.
the American public just needs to know that every single member of this administration is working with the single purpose of restoring order and making our streets safe again.
I don't need a list of names.
I need one person who can do the job.
I'll get back to you.
what took you so long?
why couldn't you just pick me up at my place, huh?
instead of leaving me on some street corner looking like some hooker.
just get in the car.
do not talk to me...
like one of your bimbos.
you got me?
they just said on the news that if the wind changes...
we're screwed.
I just want to get out of the city and get to Vegas.
we're not going to Vegas.
Oh, no. I'm not going to Palm Springs again.
no.
no, no. That's where you can just drop me off right here.
that place is like assisted living for an entire city.
we're not going there either.
we have some things we gotta do here first.
what are you talking about?
a nuclear bomb just went off, like 25 miles from here.
I'm talking about a lot of money.
now, shut up.
stop talking...
now!
Yes. Things are looking up.
what does that mean?
it means I might be able to find someone to do your dirty work.
how soon?
I expect to have some good news for you within the hour.
just make sure my money is ready to wire.
the money is ready now.
McCarthy will find someone for us.
tell the men these bombs will go off today as scheduled.
finished with Assad.
he gave me a few more names, but nothing that he thought would help.
a what else did he say?
he wants peace.
you believe him?
Yeah.
the president would like you transported to Washington DC.
you'll be leaving out of Port Hueneme on a military jet.
some of the information you gave us checked out.
good luck here in Los Angeles.
I hope the worst is over.
thank you.
sir, the FBI just upgraded one of their leads.
they're sending us live audio they think we should monitor.
what kind of audio?
they've got a guy wearing a wire at the Anacostia Detention Facility.
they think one the detainees may have information about Fayed.
give it to Chloe.
make it a priority.
you saw what happened?
it's the second time they've grabbed him and beaten him right in front of us.
we don't know anything about him, Salim.
we should just keep our distance.
he's one of us, Heydar.
look at him.
walid should not be doing this.
he's going to be okay.
that is not the point.
this was his decision.
and it was the right one.
usually it takes weeks or months to develop a cover.
he might be able to find something out within hours.
if this works, he'll have done a heroic thing for his country.
please don't give me speeches, okay?
if it works?
what if it doesn't?
what if they find out he's wearing a wire?
the guards inside know what's going on.
they'll keep an eye on him.
right.
you know, it's probably not the best thing that you're here.
I've told you before-- Walid is my client.
I know what you told me, and frankly that carries no weight with the FBI.
now let's be honest.
the only reason you're here, is you're the president's sister.
then you remember that, and we'll be fine.
you don't have any trouble bending the rules when it's to your advantage, do you?
what did they want with you?
I shouldn't bring you into this.
it's all right.
you can talk to me.
I heard the guard say he found something in your wallet.
Yeah, they confiscated it.
what was it?
what did he find?
a phone number.
Whose?
listen to me.
if you and I are in the same situation here, we should know each other.
talk to me.
maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved.
I met some people through my organization.
what organization is that?
I'm regional director.
go on.
most of what we do has no teeth.
I was introduced to a man who was more active.
I wanted to help him.
that's good.
we set up a meeting, but before I had a chance, I was grabbed.
who is this person?
you know him?
no.
but, please...
join us, brother.
he did that well.
what happens now?
he's going to have to sell himself to the others before they open up.
didn't know that you were coming here.
we need to talk.
Yeah, sure, yeah.
come on in. Come in.
damn, Jack, it's good to see you.
good to see you.
um, you've never been here before, have you?
no.
God, when was the last time we saw each other?
when Teri died.
that's right.
the funeral.
have you found dad yet?
no, no, I made some calls, but so far noth...
Hey, Josh.
come here.
Josh, this is your uncle Jack.
you two have not seen each other in a long time.
Hey.
Hi, Josh, how you doing?
okay, I guess.
it's kind of been a weird day.
Yeah, I know.
Josh, give your father some privacy.
maybe we can talk later.
I would like that.
Marilyn, I'm sorry for the intrusion.
I just need to get some information about our father and then I'll leave.
well, that was pleasant, wasn't it?
come on, let's go to my office.
have a seat.
I'm fine.
okay, so what are we doing here, Jack?
our father used to do business with an ex-Russian general.
his name was Gredenko.
do you know him?
no.
he must be one of the old guard.
you can't believe some of the drinking buddies dad's cultivated over the years.
Oh, there was this one time, we were down in Venezuela, this was before Chavez...
I didn't come here to listen to your stories.
I'm serious.
I need to find dad.
okay, we will.
boy, Jack, you could never just walk in a room and get along, could you?
I mean, I know, you know, you must have gone through hell in China and everything, but look on the bright side-- you got out.
you're here.
you should just relax a little bit.
if you try and raise your voice, I will rip your tongue out, are we clear?
gray, people in this country are dying.
I need some information.
are you going to give it to me, or do I have to start hurting you?
actually, you're hurting me now.
trust me...
I'm not.
the speech is in the teleprompter, sir.
with the most recent changes?
Yes, sir.
okay.
are you all right, sir?
Tom, I can't let the American public see how scared I am.
no, you cannot.
but then we just got hit by a nuclear bomb.
bravado would be no more appropriate than fear.
thank you, Tom.
my fellow Americans, there is no easy way to say the words...
america has been hit by a nuclear weapon.
but, as you know, this is now a fact.
the question remains, what do we as a country, as a people, do about it?
how do we rationalize the fear and sorrow that each one of us feels?
do we let our anger guide us down a dangerous path?
or do we come together, continuing to show courage and strength in the face of our enemy?
now, this horrible act of evil which has struck our great nation is the cowardly action of barbaric men.
one more thing comes out of your mouth that I don't want to hear, and this is gonna start to hurt.
I told you, I don't know where dad is.
what do you want from me?
the truth.
that is the truth.
I swear to you on my family's life.
not good enough.
you brought this on yourself.
I would like you to appear on television and appeal to members of Islamic communities everywhere.
the majority of your cabinet feels that you're making a tragic mistake.
the man has murdered countless innocents, and you are putting your hopes for this country's safety on him.
they will come after you.
I assure you of that.
we're talking about removing the president of the united states.
we are in the middle of a national crisis, and he is in over his head.
he has brought this on himself.
I need the president's itinerary, specifically in regards to Assad's televised address.
why do you need this?
the less you know, the better.
because of me, Fayed has a device that can arm all the bloody suitcase nukes he was.
you can't blame yourself.
when the next bomb goes off, and thousands of more people die, everybody will remember that I was the one that made it possible.
CTU found me.
I needed to preoccupy them with a bomb to enable my escape.
the delivery system software was programmed for five detonations at five high-priority targets.
because of your carelessness, we are now down to three.
more than enough for our needs, Gredenko.
our country lost the Cold War because it was afraid to use these weapons against the Americans.
today we will correct that mistake, and the Arabs will take all the blame.
Marilyn, it is vital that we find this man Gredenko.
if we retrace the route that you took that night, do you think that you would recognize the house?
maybe.
what's going on with you and Jack?
he's looking for someone he thinks I can help.
you mean Gredenko? What do you know about him?
I followed Graem to a house one night, he met with some Russians.
Jack wants to take me over there to see if it can jog my memory.
now you're not going to take jack to the house where Graem met the Russians.
you're going to take him to a different address.
now you do this for me, and I promise you you will see Josh again.
if you don't, he dies.
Yes. That's it.
the pale blue house on the right.
are you sure? - Yeah.
go! Go!
bomb! Everyone out!
come on, move, move, move! Don't stop!
the FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN 3: 00 P. M. AND 4: 00 P. M.
bill, it's Jack.
what do you got? - We've been ambushed.
the house that Marilyn led us to was wired with explosives.
half my team is down -- I need you to send paramedics to 9407 hendry place.
bill, they knew we were coming.
you mean Gredenko? - Yeah, I think so.
right now I'm trying to find Milo and Marilyn. I think they're being pursued by hostiles.
I'll have a team there in ten minutes.
I'll monitor local bandwidth, see what I can come up with.
bill, hurry, we need to find them.
this WAY, THIS WAY, COME ON
I-I can't...
Marilyn, come on, we've got to keep moving. You understand?
come on, move. Move!
come ON , THIS WAY
yeah?
we took out the CTU team.
so is my son dead?
Yes, sir.
right, well...
had to be done.
you have Marilyn?
no, sir, not yet.
why not yet?
she escaped with someone from CTU, but we're tracking them now.
damn it, Hacker.
we'll find her soon, sir.
the man she's with doesn't look like a trained field agent.
make sure you take her alive.
I need her to find Gredenko so I can end this mess.
I understand, sir. I'll call you as soon as I have her.
Hey.
they know we're here.
are you sure?
Yeah.
Marilyn, listen to me. I'm going to cover you.
when I do, I want you to head back towards the alley.
I want you to run as fast and as far away from here as you can, you understand me?
okay.
the targets are right behind us. Behind those dumpsters.
remember... we need to take that woman alive.
just wait... Wait till I tell you.
go!
let's GO, LET'S GO
I told you to go!
I couldn't!
let's go. - Wait! Wait!
kill him.
drop your weapon! - Let her go!
drop your weapon or I will kill her.
if you wanted to kill her, she'd be dead by now.
now drop your weapon! Or I will use mine!
do it!
on your knees! Now!
hands on your head! Interlace your fingers!
turn around and face the fence!
Milo! Let me see it.
the bullet went through and through. There's no arterial bleeding.
you're going to be okay. CTU will be here in a minute.
take this gun. Make sure he doesn't move.
that call you took, that was from Gredenko.
you tipped him off! Now over half my team is dead!
you don't understand.
what don't I understand? That Gredenko knew we were coming?
it wasn't Gredenko on the phone. Those aren't his men.
if those weren't Gredenko's men, whose were they?
who sent them? - Your father.
what are you talking about?
it's true, Jack. I swear.
your father called me in the car.
my father?
he told me to lead you to that house.
he said if I didn't...he said he'd killed Graem, and that if he had to, he would kill Josh.
I'm sorry.
he has my son.
do you have the address to Gredenko's safe house?
I need you to give it to me now.
I can't. I can't.
not until I have my son.
I will help you get Josh back, but I need that address now.
Gredenko is our only chance of recovering the nuclear weapons.
you saw what happened in Valencia earlier today.
this is going to be worse.
please.
just give me the address.
I recognized the house once we were driving.
it's on glascoe-- 9421.
don't move.
Buchanan. - Bill, it's Jack.
I've got the correct address for Gredenko's safe house. 9421 Glascoe.
Turner's team will be there any minute. You run point on this.
no, I want you to send me a smaller team to my location.
I'm at an industrial park on pine, just south of oxford.
make sure the team brings me a vehicle with a full tactical kit.
then they're going to have to transfer Milo back to CTU. He's been shot, but he's not critical.
I want you to divert the rest of the team to the address on Glascoe-- have them initiate the attack.
get back to me as soon as soon you've got Gredenko in custody.
Jack, what's going on?
I'll explain everything later.
that's not good enough.
bill, please. Just trust me.
this is personal.
how could I have been so stupid?
Hi. - Hey.
did you finish the vectors? - No.
you know, if you're having trouble, I can help you.
I'm not having trouble. I'm just not finished, and I don't want this to turn into another conversation about whether or not I'm okay.
I'm sorry, love.
it's all right, but if you can't talk to me, then you should talk to a staff psychologist or your sponsor.
I don't need a shrink. I don't want to talk to sponsor, I'll be fine.
Milo was shot during the operation, but he's going to be okay.
what happened?
he held off three armed hostiles until Jack could get there.
from what I understand, he's going to be up for a commendation.
Morris, when milo gets here, I want you to debrief him as soon as medical gives you the okay.
Yeah, yeah, I'll debrief him, and thanks for rubbing that salt in the wounds.
what are you talking about? The nukes are armed because I'm a coward, and now you want me to listen to Milo talk about what a bloody hero he is.
coincidence?
it'll be taken care of, thanks.
taken care of.
we're coordinating the Gredenko operation from here.
tac teams are moving in on his location.
I'll be right there.
obviously I pushed you back to work too soon.
I'll have someone from district relieve you.
no, no, that would just make me feel worse.
look, I need a few minutes-- I'll be fine. I'm going to take a walk.
I'll cover for you, but you need to be back here before we launch.
Yeah, I will.
give me the phone; we need to make the call.
scrambler collar has to be enabled.
give us a second, please.
does he know where Phillip is holding Josh? - No.
I'm gonna have to force my father's hand.
meaning what? - He's gonna call my father, tell him he's apprehended you, but that you won't give him Gredenko's location until he takes you to see your son.
what if Phillip refuses? - Then you have to stay firm.
tell him it's not a negotiation, no matter what he threatens.
Jack, you're asking me to put Josh's life at risk.
Josh's life is at risk.
trust me, my father is not going to give away his location unless he thinks he has to.
is that what this is about-- finding Phillip? Josh is secondary?
my father will have Josh with him.
Marilyn, I will do everything in my power to make sure your son is safe.
how do you know he won't betray us?
he wants to live.
let's go.
you don't want to watch this.
you know, Josh...
your father was very proud of you.
he used to tell me how blessed he felt knowing everything that he was working so hard to build would be left in such good hands.
do we really have to talk about this right now, grandpa?
no...
of course not.
he loved you very much.
remember, I'll be able to hear both sides of this conversation.
you're set.
dial.
do you have her? - Yeah...
but we took casualties. I'm on my own now.
are you assembling another team to take out Gredenko?
Yeah, I am, but she's refusing to tell me where gredenko is until she sees her son.
put her on.
I did what you asked, now where's Josh?
Marilyn, look, I know you're frightened, but this doesn't have to end badly.
if you help me find Gredenko, we can all survive this, as a family.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just want my son.
I'm just saying, you made your deal with Graem.
now make a deal with me.
with enough time, you and I...
and Josh can rebuild whatever is left of this family.
after all, the legacy I'm trying to preserve will someday be his.
we can do this.
but first, you have to tell me where Gredenko is.
only after this man takes me to see my son.
bringing you here will only complicate things, and I need Gredenko now.
tell me where he is.
no.
you may have misunderstood my offer as a sign of weakness, so let me make it perfectly clear.
if you do not help me,
I see no future for you or Josh.
I will walk into the next room, and I will kill him.
right now.
tell me...
or Josh dies.
I will not tell you what you want to know until I have my son.
give him back the phone.
yeah?
bring her to me at the Grandmont hotel. Room 2132.
we're on our way.
we got the address.
you did great.
cuff him, put him in the back.
uh, I'm just gonna go downstairs to get a soda.
did you want anything? - No, thanks.
did you look in the minibar?
Yeah, but there really wasn't anything that I wanted.
why don't you call room service?
well, I just feel like getting out.
don't even think about it.
no one's life is worth the destruction of everything I've built.
now step away from the door.
I was beginning to worry.
meeting went long. Here's the president's itinerary.
Oh, good.
this will work.
so when... when does all this happen?
now.
I need you to authorize clearance for someone to get inside the bunker.
once he's inside, he'll carry the ball.
carry the ball? You mean, kill the president.
sir, I would like to think that we are beyond the point of second-guessing ourselves.
this president has endangered the lives of millions of people.
so who is this person we're putting inside?
he's a security specialist, private sector, but I've already put in a request for him to advise my group on civil response options.
he has level two clearance; I just need you upgrade him.
they will trace this thing right back to me.
no. You won't even be investigated.
we have a cover.
a cover? Who?
Assad? You're trying to make it look like he did this?
sir, all you need to do is call in your authorization code.
that's all the information you need on him.
Mr. Lennox, the president has asked to see you.
okay, tell the president I will be with him in a moment.
sir, our man will be here within the hour.
call me when you're done with the president.
Tom, come in.
you asked to see me, sir?
Yes, I'd like to hear your thoughts about something.
my thoughts on what, sir? - Assad's speech.
he's going live in less than one hour, and before I give him my thoughts, I wanted to hear yours.
is there a problem? - Uh, no, sir, it's just...
what?
I assumed you were no longer interested in my opinion, sir.
Tom, I still value your judgment, and if I've made you feel otherwise, I apologize.
all right, sir.
how much longer? - I'm not sure.
I have to recalculate the profile for two of the target cities.
hurry. I don't want to be exposed like this any longer than necessary.
you think the authorities know we're working with Fayed?
if they don't, they will soon.
I was in my kitchen when I saw the flash.
I turned to look out my window, and itust exploded, all the windows.
there was glass everywhere.
and then there was this sound.
it was so loud.
Oh, man.
hell of a day, huh?
Yeah, you could say that. - Can I get you anything else?
no.
Yeah.
whiskey. Plain, single malt.
what kind? - That kind.
this? - Yeah.
and these. - Okay.
your change? - Keep it.
I'm on my way.
from where?
I told you, I went out for a walk.
the tac team is about to move in on Gredenko.
I need you at your station.
I'm on my way. - Morris...
come with me.
I want you to put this on, under your clothes.
my hands are shaking. - Here.
I'm going to do everything I can to get him back.
he's the only reason I stayed with Graem...
he was the only good thing I had left since...
you ready? - Yeah.
let's go.
get out.
you do exactly what I tell you.
you understand me?
let's go.
Hey, Milo? - HeY.
how are you holding up?
they say I'm going to be okay.
It's...so what happened?
I was stupid.
they don't pay me to be a field agent.
well, maybe they should, because, uh...
you protected Marilyn Bauer. That's what I heard.
I had no idea what I was doing.
the whole thing just happened so fast.
you don't have to downplay it to make me fell better.
you don't have to do that.
okay.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah. Well done.
Thanks.
I'm going to push Assad to make these changes.
your suggestions are all excellent, Tom.
Oh? Just doing my job, Mr. President.
I'd like you to be there when he delivers this.
I will be, sir.
if you'll excuse me, I have a briefing with senator benson.
of course, Tom.
I have some notes that need to be taken to Assad.
Yes, Mr. President. I'll be right there.
what did the president want?
he asked me to review Assad's speech which he'll never get the chance to deliver.
listen, sir...you need to authorize that clearance.
our man will be here any minute.
it's in the works.
it's just taking a while to complete the authorization.
all right, well, we need it before he's here.
I will call security again.
I will phone you back if there's any problem.
meanwhile, go meet with him. -all right
this is tom lennox.
I need to speak to the ranking secret service agent on site.
agent hollister.
agent hollister, this is tom lennox.
I need to see you immediately.
Yes, sir.
I can meet you as soon as I get someone to man my position, which should be in about 15 minutes.
no, that's not soon enough. I've got something to show you.
where are you right now?
b" wing, room 17.
I'm on my way.
Carson wondered if you were playing us.
he said that he didn't want to bring you into this, but I defended you!
I said that we could trust you.
I told him that you understood.
nothing justifies the killing of a president.
this president is giving us no choice.
don't do this.
it's already done.
Yes, uh, this is Reed Pollock.
I have a message for agent Hollister from Mr. Lennox.
Yes. Could you please tell him that the issue has been resolved and that Mr. Lennox won't need to meet with him.
Yes, sir.
okay. Thanks.
we just confirmed Marilyn Bauer's intel.
the Glasgow house is owned by a Russian shell corporation that Gredenko has a hidden interest in.
is Turner's team in place?
they'll let me know when they're ready to go.
Chloe, lock satellite and establish a comm link.
where were you? I told you not to take too long.
sorry.
comm unit's operational, but the backup module needs to be reset.
you better go do it now; the operation starts in two minutes.
: come with me.
do you realize that after everything we've been through what a betrayal this is?
I was a little late.
Morris, I can smell it on your breath.
Yes..I took a drink, but I spat it out straight away.
please... - I swear.
Chloe, look at me. Look at me.
I am stone-cold sober.
you're losing control.
you're placing other people's lives in danger.
I'm going to have to tell Buchanan.
after everything that has happened...
something had to give.
the important thing is, that I realized I didn't want to throw everything away, especially you, especially you.
and I stopped myself, and that is a little victory.
right?
I swear, it will never happen again.
please don't tell Buchanan because you're right
for me getting back to work is the best medicine.
I'll be watching you for the rest of the shift.
fine.
I will.
Turner's team is taking final positions.
Chloe, open the video link.
Hal, what's your status?
no sign of a lookout.
windows are covered, but we're good to go.
commence at your discretion.
Ryan, is your team ready?
Yes, sir.
okay, we're going in on three, two, one.
clear...
first sweep, all clear, sir.
Roger that.
Mr. Buchanan, there no sign of Gredenko or anyone.
Hal, as soon as you've completed a full sweep, process the place for evidence.
Yes, sir.
Chloe, text Jack's cell phone, tell him we don't have Gredenko.
open it.
hold up here.
operation status: Gredenko not at location
what's wrong?
it's nothing.
don't even think about trying to warn my father.
once he sees that you brought me here, he's more likely to shoot you than I am.
do you understand me? - Yeah.
both of you go up to the door.
you knock; when he let's you in, I'll follow.
let's go.
Marilyn, get back.
open the door.
now, go.
where the hell is my father?
I don't know, I swear.
Where's Josh?
Marilyn, just stay calm.
put these on.
answer it; put it on speaker.
Hello?
Hello, marilyn.
Jack, even when you were young, I learned never to underestimate you.
I didn't want to hurt Josh.
you've forced my hand.
take a look out the window, the adjacent roof.
Oh, Phillip, please don't!
dad...
you only have one play left here, that's to try and cut a deal with the government.
explain your connection to the nuke; tell them you'll try and help them in exchange for immunity.
right now that is your only option.
you pull that trigger and that option is gone. Do you understand me?
gone.
I'm no fool, Jack.
they're never going to give me immunity after everything I've done.
you don't know that. You don't know that for sure!
right now they are desperate.
but either way, for you, this is over. Dad, it's over!
there is no empire to protect. There's no legacy left.
there is Marilyn, Josh and me; that's it.
please, dad.
I know you don't want to hurt Josh.
I'm the one you want.
you let Josh go...
I will surrender.
come alone, unarmed, and I'll let Josh go.
but if you bring anyone else into this, I will kill him.
I understand.
hang up the phone.
this is Jack Bauer.
I need you to send a team over to the Grandmont hotel to pick up a hostile.
he's been secured. He's in roo2132.
wait a way.
this is our only chance.
Hey, I need to talk to you.
about what? - Morris.
look, he came and saw me in the infirmary... - look, I know he's been a little shaky.
has he been drinking?
you smelled it on his breath? - Yeah.
I did, too. I already talked to him about it. He didn't metabolize the alcohol.
he didn't metabolize the alcohol?
I know it sounds weird, but it's true. He took a drink and he spit it back out.
how do you know? - Because he told me.
and you believe him?
I don't have to believe him. I was married to him
if he was drunk, I would know. He's not drunk.
he's been sober for three years.
I didn't know he was an alcoholic.
now you know.
and you don't think Buchanan should know about this?
no.
if he slips up again, I will personally tell Buchanan.
let's just leave it for now.
okay.
okay. I want you to wait here for Josh.
do you think your father will keep his word?
as long as I keep mine. You know how to use this?
no. - Point and shoot.
once I get josh, do you want me to call CTU and tell them to send help?
no. I need to take care of this myself.
thank you.
everything's going to be all right.
just wait here.
I'm unarmed!
dad!
I'm unarmed!
come out! I am unarmed!
that's close enough.
turn around.
now show me that you're not wearing an ankle holster.
take one step toward me for every step Josh takes away.
slowly.
your mother's waiting for you in the stairwell around the corner. Go.
go!
Oh, Josh! Oh, god...
are you okay? Are you okay? Let's go. Go.
I never meant for this to happen, Jack.
I didn't have a choice.
I don't know how exactly, but Gredenko found out about my role in David Palmer's assassination.
so...
he blackmailed me, forced me to cooperate.
so it was Gredenko who had you divert some of the bombs the company was responsible for destroying?
he's a radical nationalist.
told me that he wanted to preserve some of the arsenal for the day when the soviet union would be reestablished.
I believed him because I had to.
when did you find out he sold the bombs to Fayed?
not until one of the bombs was detonated in Valencia.
that's the truth?!
Absolutely.
I've been looking for Gredenko ever since.
so that I could find out what he knew about Fayed, and stop all this.
I'm a patriot, jack.
I never wanted any harm to come to this country.
you want to lie to yourself, you go ahead, but stop lying to me!
you let all of this happen just so you could coveup what you did!
you have all the smarts that Graem never had.
you'd have handled Gredenko before this all got out of control.
you know, none of this would have happened if you hadn't turned your back on me.
so that you could become-- what?
a civil servant.
so...
your people will use Gredenko to find this terrorist, and the truth will come out about all I've done.
we never got Gredenko.
then all this was for nothing.
on your knees.
I didn't have to end like this, jack.
you could've had it all.
I want you to know...
I never wanted you to feel like I had turned my back on you.
that I had turned my back on the family.
I just had to go my own way.
do things for myself. I...
it was never good enough for you.
I'm sorry.
anyway...
I'm ready.
what are you waiting for?
do it! Damn you!
Jack Call 310 597 3781
yes?
my name is Jack Bauer. Who am I talking to?
you must've exhausted all your options to find Gredenko.
who is this?
it's Charles Logan, Jack.
I might be able to help you, but we need to talk face-to-face.
where are you? - I'm near the airport.
good, you're local. CTU knows where I am.
come and see me, jack, as soon as possible and come alone.
I'm looking forward to it.
as someone who has alienated followers by choosing the unpopular course.
I suggest you tread carefully among your people.
they will come after you.
I need you to authorize clearance for someone to get inside the bunker.
once he's inside, he'll carry the ball.
you mean, kill the president?
we have a cover. - A cover? Who?
you're trying to make it look like he did this?
this is Tom Lennox. I need to speak to the ranking secret service agent on site.
Carson wondered if you were playing us.
he said that he didn't want to bring you into this, but I defended you!
nothing justifies the killing of a president.
the delivery system software was programmed for five high-priority targets.
because of your carelessness, we are now down to three.
more than enough for our needs, Gredenko.
I don't want to be exposed like this any longer than necessary.
do you think the authorities know we're working with Fayed?
if they don't, they will soon.
bill, it's Jack.
I've got the correct address for Gredenko's safe house.
Turner's team will be there any minute.
clear!
clear!
Mr. Buchanan, there's no sign of Gredenko or anyone.
now you talk. That was from Gredenko.
you tipped him off. Now over half my team is dead!
it wasn't Gredenko on the phone.
those aren't his men!
who sent them?! - Your father!
he has my son!
take a look out the window. The adjacent roof.
Jack: Dad, it's over!
there is no empire to protect.
there's no legacy left. I'm the one you want.
you let Josh go, I will surrender.
you could have had it all.
what are you waiting for?
do it!
who am I talking to? - It's Charles Logan, Jack.
you must have exhausted all your options to find Gredenko.
come and see me.
and come alone.
the FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN 4: 00 P. M. AND 5: 00 P. M
go ahead.
we're on our way to the rendezvous.
good. We've arrived.
is the shipment there from Nevada?
no, they are behind schedule.
but they'll be here any moment.
how soon can you deploy once we arrive?
it will take us two hours to assemble the delivery system and run diagnostics, another hour to secure the payload.
that's longer than I'd hoped.
listen, we are working with the best technology.
it can't be rushed.
just remember, without us you'd be delivering your payload in weeks instead of hours.
I haven't forgotten.
it seems necessary to remind you now and then.
I'll be glad when we no longer have to deal with these people.
they are living in the dark ages.
and they act like they own the world.
I'd much rather be fighting them.
if we succeed today, we'll never have to.
the Arabs and the west, they'll destroy each other.
the ambassador just arrived, Mr. President. He's in the waiting area.
good.
will Tom Lennox be joining us?
I spoke to Reed Pollock.
he says Mr. Lennox is briefing the speaker and minority leader.
when tom's finished, tell him I want to see him, please.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Ambassador.
it's good to see you again, sir.
Mr. President, first allow me to express my country's shock and deep regret over the devastating attack in California.
thank you, sir. - Of course.
any assistance you may require, you need only ask.
I'm asking you now, sir. That's why you're here.
I believe you know Hamri Al-assad.
Mr. Ambassador.
I have never met Mr. Assad in person, but I know him by reputation.
his organization has carried out repeated terrorist actions against my country.
your own policies precipitated those actions.
that's your justification for killing innocent people?
you and I define innocent in different ways.
my own deputy lost his seven-year-old son in one of your bombings.
that is how I define innocent.
we are not here to air past differences.
then why are we here, Mr. President?
at our last meeting, I informed you that we were in contact with Assad.
you told me it was a positive step toward peace.
and I meant it at that time, but I must confess, after the last attack, I didn't expect to see you in the same room with him.
and I'm not so sure I care to remain here either.
it is no more pleasant for me, your excellency.
would you give us a moment?
certainly.
assad is here because of the attack.
to be frank, sir, we have three more nuclear weapons loose in my country in the hands of terrorists.
we didn't know that.
in less than one hour, Assad is going to go on national television and issue a statement.
it will be a global appeal to extremists.
now, he's going to urge them to put down their arms and engage in peaceful netiation with the west.
now, we are hoping to compel someone to come forward with any information regarding those nuclear weapons.
a petition like this coming from Assad?
it could have a profound effect. - We're counting on that.
what do you need from us?
I want a public statement of support from your prime minister.
and I want it to follow right on the heels of Assad's.
Mr. Assad is a polarizing figure in my country.
a public endorsement of him could have grave political consequences for the prime minister.
then you tell your prime minister that we have a carrier group operating less than 25 miles off his shores.
my advisors are pressing me hard for a military response, so if we are attacked again.
I won't be able to hold them off.
this is sounding like an ultimatum, Mr. President.
it's not an ultimatum, Mr. Ambassador.
I'm merely pointing out the fact that neither the prime minister nor I have the luxury of worrying about political consequences on a day like today.
I am putting my presidency on the line, so please, stop handing me excuses.
get on the phone and make this happen.
Nadia, what's the status?
Turner's team just completed their second sweep of the house. But the results were negative.
if Gredenko was using this address, he did a really good job cleaning up after he left.
there was one operating land line.
Morris is checking on the router to see if there's any recent activity.
Morris?! - Yes.
any luck on the land line? - No. I mean, not yet.
they must have used an inverter to stack their calls 'cause I can't get any records out.
Mr. Buchanan, Jack Bauer's on the line.
go ahead, Jack.
bill, I'm near the airport across the street from the Grandmont Hotel.
I know. What's going on?
it's complicated. Are the units dispatched?
we have two units on the way to the Grandmont. I'll have them meet you.
okay, I want you to contact LAPD.
have them set up a five-block perimeter around the hotel.
they need to locate my father and take him into custody.
your father? - He's involved in this.
I'll debrief you as soon as we've got time.
were you able to pick up anything on Gredenko?
no. The Glasgow Street house was deserted.
we're processing it for clues but so far we've come up empty.
we can't be sure Gredenko was even there.
I think I might have a lead.
what is it? - Charles Logan.
Logan? - I spoke to him.
he says he has information on Gredenko.
how the hell did you trace this to Logan?
through my father. Bill, I need you to get me a helicopter that can take me to him.
he's at his retreat in Hidden Valley. He's under house arrest.
house arrest? How was that possible? He was involved in the murder of David Palmer.
he brokered a closed-door deal. He plead guilty to obstruction of justice.
the public never even knew of his involvement in aiding terrorists for David Palmer's assassination.
give me that helicopter. - We have one in the area.
shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to have it rerouted to your location.
thank you.
what happened?
my father escaped. I don't know where he is.
he might be in the area. I want you both to go back to CTU.
Josh, I know that there's a lot to explain, and I promise you when this is over, you and I are going to sit down and I will talk you through what happened.
okay. - Let's go.
you're not coming with us? - No, Gredenko wasn't at the house.
I need to follow up another lead.
take these people back to CTU. - Yes, sir.
Josh, get in.
thank you.
thank you for saving my son.
he reminds me of you.
you can see it in his eyes.
Marilyn, please, you have to go.
okay.
gentlemen.
sign in, sirs.
we'll need to process you again, Mr. Carson.
of course.
what's your occupation? - I'm a policy analyst with the Stanton Institute.
state your business here.
I'm here to consult on civil defense procedures.
at the request of Tom Lennox.
test, one, two, three.
test, one, two, three.
thank you, sirs. - Thank you.
thank you.
we've got a problem. Tom Lennox tried to warn secret service about us.
What?!
I stopped him before he was able to alert anyone.
but I had to restrain him.
you said that Lennox was on board with the plan.
I thought that he was. Either he's changed his mind or you're right and he's been playing us all along.
regardless, we're gonna have to deal with it.
son of a bitch.
we've got to move him. I'm going to need this space.
get me some tape.
let's go, over here.
sit down, hands behind your back.
we're going to have to take care of him. Make it look like a suicide.
no.
no.
listen, eliminating president Palmer is for the good of the country, all right?
it's the only way to get him out of office.
killing Tom Lennox only benefits us.
we don't have any choice. - Listen. Tom Lennox is a very smart man.
now I think that once Vice President Daniels is holding the reins, and enacting the policies that Lennox himself created, we can convince him to keep quiet.
I'm not gambling my life on Lennox's good judgment.
look, it's a risk, but it is a risk that I'm willing to take.
we're not cold-blooded murderers.
we're just trying to save our country.
either way, we do not have time to resolve this now.
assad goes before the cameras within an hour.
you said it would take 25 minutes for you to assemble this?
25 to 30. -Then you better get started now.
if we're going to frame Assad for the assassination, then this bomb has to explode when they're both together.
we're never going to have a better chance than now.
Yes, Melinda.
I'm still waiting for the briefing stats that Tom promised me.
well, Tom just e-mailed them to you. They should be on your screen by the time you're back at your desk.
okay.
by the way, is Tom in his office?
uh, no, no.
um, no, Tom is down in conference B.
he's meeting with some policy analysts from Langley.
I just came from conference B. Secret service is meeting in there.
well, they must have switched to another room, then.
listen, I'll try to track Tom down for you.
what is it, Morris?
I have to uplink these traffic vectors to the homeland sub-net.
I've been trying, I've been trying and it just won't go through.
check your S. I.P. Adapter. - What about my S. I.P. Adapter?
you've specified the wrong slot assignment.
Oh, what an idiot.
thank you. That'll work.
did you call your sponsor?
I'm getting tired of you giving me the third degree.
Yeah, well, I covered for you. I didn't tell anyone you took a drink.
I didn't take a drink -- I spat it out. I told you.
you promised me you'd call your sponsor. - And I did.
well?
we had this long talk.
I feel a lot better, really.
you're not acting like it.
why don't we install a breathalyzer at my work station? Will that satisfy you?
I just want to make sure you're okay.
I helped terrorists arm a nuclear bomb today. I'm not going to be okay for a long time.
that doesn't mean to say I can't do my job.
now if you'll excuse me, I have to swap out this server port.
Where's Morris?
he's swapping out a server port.
he's supposed to be checking on Gredenko's landline.
well, he's juggling a lot right now. Being short-handed, we're all trying to pick up the slack.
now, I'm wondering if it's more than that.
what?
look, he's been tortured. He's under a lot of stress. Maybe he should be pulled.
Yeah, he's a little upset, but he's still better than 90% of the tech people we have around here.
we need Morris on the floor.
all right, Chloe, but I'm keeping my eye on him. If I see anything else I don't like, I go to Buchanan.
fine.
Hi, this is Jeannie. I'm not here right now, but please leave a message and the time of day you called and I'll get back to you.
Hi, Jeannie, this is Chloe O'brian. You don't know me, but I'm Morris's ex-wife.
could you call me back as soon as possible? It's important.
I'm at 597-3781. Thank you.
Jack will be arriving at Logan's estate any moment.
I want tac teams on alert and prepped for redeployment.
Yes, sir. - We're out of leads.
let's hope Jack can get something from Logan.
could we have a moment, please?
must have been hard for you to find out about your father's involvement in all of this.
I'm not here to talk about my father.
dmitri Gredenko -- what do you know about him?
I know Gredenko supplied Fayed with five Russian tactical nukes, one of which exploded this morning in Valencia.
one of which you managed to disarm, so that leaves us three we need to recover.
that's correct.
I get regular intelligence updates.
and I still have my sources.
so you need Gredenko to find Fayed.
can you help us? - Yes, I can.
but you want some kind of plea agreement.
you're unbelievable.
I don't blame you for thinking that, Jack.
but I want you to know that I'm not the same man that I was two years ago.
just as you're not the same man who was dragged away and thrown into a Chinese prison.
I've changed. I've had time to think about what I did.
I have reconnected with my faith.
so, no, I don't want a pardon.
and I wouldn't accept it if it was offered to me.
what do you want? - Nothing.
I want to give you the information you need with no conditions.
I'm listening.
I never dealt with Gredenko directly, but I know how we can find him.
how? - Through Anatoly Markov.
he's the Russian consul general, here in Los Angeles.
CTU contacted the consul general as soon as we saw Gredenko's name on the list.
he denied any knowledge of his whereabouts.
Markov's lying.
he's been the liaison for Gredenko for years.
liaison for what?
for business concerns looking to acquire the products that Gredenko provides.
no, don't. Don't make the wrong play, Jack.
now if you go down official channels, you'll end up in a hopeless maze.
Markov has friends in the highest levels of the Russian government.
they can protect him indefinitely.
if you want to access what he knows right now, you need to go through back channels.
what back channels? - Me.
I'm your best chance to get the information you need in the time frame you need it.
what are you proposing? - That I speak to Markov myself, in person.
why would markov talk to you? - Because I have leverage.
Markov was involved in the conspiracy that put me where I am today.
I didn't give him up.
but he knows I still can.
I don't trust you.
if you want to find Gredenko, maybe it's time you started.
go ahead, Jack.
Mr. President, thank you for taking my call.
you said it was urgent.
I think we have a way of finding Gredenko.
it was my understanding that we lost Gredenko.
are you telling me we have new lead?
Yes, sir.
Mr. President, the lead is Charles Logan.
Logan? - Yes, sir. I'm with him now.
he claims that his administration had dealings with Gredenko, and that he has a contact that will lead us to him.
who?
Aanatolyotoly Markov-- the Russian consul in Los Angeles.
when we learned about Gredenko, Jack, I placed a call to the consulate myself.
now that's a dead end. - Not according to Logan.
he wants to meet with Markov in the consulate in person.
he says that's the only way that we can get the information we need.
Logan is under house arrest.
that's why I'm calling you, Mr. President.
we need an executive order granting Logan a temporary furlough.
do you realize what you're asking me?
Logan was behind the assassination of my brother.
sir, I would not be calling if I didn't think this was necessary.
I don't trust this man, Jack.
this could be some maneuver on his part to gain his freedom.
I think we need to take a chance on him, and I will enter the consulate with Logan as part of his security detail.
besides that, I think he's after something else.
and what exactly would that be?
redemption.
Jack, I have no desire to facilitate any kind of redemption for Charles Logan.
Mr. President, right now I think he's the only way we're going to find Gredenko and the bombs.
put him on.
he wants to talk to you.
Hello, Mr. President.
I want to hear it from your lips. Tell me why I should agree to this.
because you need me, Mr. President. It's as simple as that.
I can speak to the Russian consul myself.
Yes, sir, you could do that, but with all due respect, you'd be wasting your time.
I have a prior relationship with Markov that we can exploit.
again, with due respect, sir, I have more experience dealing with people of Markov's character.
you mean criminals like yourself?
I know how he thinks, and that's an advantage you can't afford to ignore.
I want you to know that if this is some kind of move to escape custody, I will commit the resources of my administration to hunt you down.
I can assure you, Mr. President, I have nothing like that in mind.
several years ago, I was in the same situation, and I...
reached out to your brother for counsel.
david helped me successfully navigate that crisis.
Yes.
he did.
and you repaid him by killing him.
I would like to do for you what your brother did for me.
I would like to help you get through this.
don't make the mistake of assuming this represents any kind of forgiveness on my part.
I understand that, Mr. President, but I hope over time to earn your forgiveness.
put Jack on the phone.
Yes, Mr. President?
I'm granting the furlough.
just make it count, Jack. - I'll do my best.
thank you, Mr. President.
this isn't easy for you, is it, Jack?
what?
the possibility I may not be the same man you've hated for so long.
you're late.
did you have any trouble?
we had to bypass a vehicle inspection in Riverside.
other than that, we had a smooth trip.
good. Let's have a look.
open up.
the U. S. Military has spent millions to develop this drone.
today American taxpayers will get a demonstration of...
what their money has produced.
according to Charles Logan, Anatoly Markov, the head of the Russian consulate in Los Angeles, has information on Gredenko.
Logan and Bauer are going to see Markov now.
I want comm locked on any communication outside and possibly inside the consulate.
Yes.
I want you to hand that over to Chloe.
Why?
because of what you've been through today. I'm not sure you can handle it, and we can't afford any mistakes.
look, I'm perf...
Chloe, I want you to take over Morris's workload on the consulate.
no. No, it's not okay. It's not okay. I...
I'd like to say something to everyone.
I'm very sorry that I gave the reprogramming device to Fayed.
if I could take it back, I would, but I can't.
and if you don't think I can do my job, Mr. Buchanan, then I should leave.
but I can do my job.
okay, Morris. Give your task full priority.
thank you.
Mr. Buchanan, I have to disagree with your decision.
I'm sorry, Morris, but I just don't think you're ready.
your objection is noted, Nadia.
my decision stands.
you're wasting your energy.
and you're distracting me.
the president's gonna die.
there's nothing you can do about it.
people are starting to ask questions about Tom's whereabouts. Are you on schedule?
I told you the bomb would be ready in 30 minutes, and I meant it.
okay.
is there a problem? - No.
you can't go soft on us now, Reed.
no, it's...
it's just starting to hit me.
what we're about to do.
my god...
we're killing the President of the United States.
we're trying to save this country.
that's all you need to think about.
Chloe, look at the function prototypes on Morris's report.
what's the problem? - Take a look.
you mean the missing sectors?
Yes, the missing sectors.
did Buchanan make a mistake by reinstating Morris too soon?
no. The Pentagon put a file lock on these items.
I told him we could back-fill them later.
it's not gonna be to anyone's benefit if you're covering for him.
I'm not.
fine.
Morris, I need you to tell me the truth.
have you been drinking?
I just had a couple of beers, love. I didn't think anyone would mind.
don't be sarcastic. Your data merge is incomplete.
I had to cover for you. I just told Nadia...
whoa, wait. What was incomplete?
look.
Oh, for crying out loud, these sectors are irrelevant.
I only fill them in when I file my final report.
you know that Nadia wants these completed.
Nadia only wants to prove to Buchanan that she was right and that I shouldn't be here.
no one is out to get you.
look, even I know that I shouldn't be here.
there's a big part of me that wants to go home, crawl into bed and forget this day ever happened.
but I'm staying, because CTU needs me.
he brought me out of a horrible pit,
set my feet upon a rock...
and established my goings.
one step at a time, Charles.
one step at a time.
Logan's almost ready-- we should be able to get to the consulate within 45 minutes.
what have you got on Markov?
we ran his name through the interagency sub-net.
he's a career diplomat. Assigned consul general in '96.
prior to that, worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the Russian Federation.
no red flags from NSA, Interpol or CIA.
as far as they're concerned, he's clean.
out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. PS 27:5; 31:8
Jack, what if Logan isn't telling the truth?
we're out of options -- I have to trust him.
you know, we have no jurisdiction at the consulate.
just make sure you have teams ready in case Logan's lead pans out.
all right.
O'Brian. - Chloe, contact the highway patrol.
have them clear a ground corridor from Logan's estate to the Russian consulate.
Yes, sir.
Hello? - Yeah, hi. This is Jeannie.
you left me a message? - Yeah.
thanks for getting back to me. - So, what can I do for you?
look, I know you talked to morris earlier, and that this is probably way out of line and against your confidentiality agreement, but it's just, I'm really worried about him.
I'm sorry, I haven't spoken to Morris since I left the program three years ago.
Hello?
okay. Sorry to bother you.
have you seen Morris? - No. I'm sorry.
xxxxx - is Morris down there?
I haven't seen him. XXXXXXX
Morris, what are you doing in there?
what? Wait. - Open the door! Open the door!
what the bloody hell is going on?
I called your sponsor, Jeannie. She said she hasn't talked to you in three years.
are you out of your bleeding mind?!
I trusted you-- I put my job on the line for you.
you lied to me. - I didn't lie to you.
Yes, you did. - I didn't lie to you.
Jeannie's not my sponsor anymore; Ted is.
Ted? - Yeah. Remember Ted with the hair?
he's my sponsor. I called him just like I told you.
check if you want -- I'll give you his number.
not now!
I don't know what to say. I was worried about you.
marching into a men's room isn't worried, it's obsessed.
now, I appreciate your concern. I love your concern.
but, darling, you have to take a look at what's going on in your head. It's not pretty.
sorry.
Mr. President.
from the Attorney General, sir.
the executive order authorizing President Logan's release.
thank you, Melinda.
the Communications Director wanted you to know that they'll be ready for an on-camera rehearsal with Assad in five minutes.
fine.
have we heard from Tom Lennox?
no, sir. I've been trying him. There's no answer at his office.
find him. I want him present for Assad's statement.
Yes, sir.
sir.
I'm gonna take that off of you, and I'm gonna clean up that cut, but if you try to call out, Carson will kill you and I cannot stop him.
do you understand?
okay.
you have got to put a stop to this, Reed.
no, Mr. Lennox.
when this is done and the president is out of the way,
I think that you will see things differently.
I think that you will see that this is better for our country.
no, you're going to destroy this country, Reed.
you're just as bad as Fayed.
no, no. There must have been a moment when you were onboard with this plan.
were you playing us from the beginning? Hmm?
were you?
or did you change your mind along the way?
I need to know.
then know this. I was against you from the start.
that's very disappointing.
hello.
Yes, hello, Melinda.
Oh, yes, I'm just with Tom right now. He's just finishing the briefing.
you know, I-I understand. I will let Mr. Lennox know right away. Okay?
Thanks.
the president is asking for Lennox. We've gotta move.
I'm almost done.
finished.
it's armed. - Okay.
now... this is the detonator.
press 6-2-4-enter, and a signal will activate the bomb.
okay. 6-2-4-enter.
Yeah.
once the signal's been sent, it'll take 15 seconds for the chemicals to intermix.
the kill radius is only ten feet. Make sure Palmer's inside it.
you sure you can do it?
I'm the only one who can get close enough to that podium without attracting attention.
I can do this.
all right, everyone, rehearsal's up in five minutes. Please notify the president.
excuse me, could we have some water for the podium?
sure. - Thank you.
the president is traveling.
before we continue, I would just like to express my appreciation.
you're taking a great risk, Mr. President.
you and I both are sharing that risk, sir, and maybe that, in and of itself, is something of a victory.
I just hope that someone will listen to our appeal.
you sound skeptical.
the people we're trying to reach, they abandoned the political process a long time ago.
all we need to do is create a foundation to build on.
the rest will follow.
reed. - Yes, Mr. president.
this is Hamri Al-assad.
Mr. Pollock is our deputy chief of staff.
how do you do? - Hello, sir.
if you wouldn't mind getting comfortable behind the podium, I'd like to speak to Reed for a minute, please.
of course.
Mr. Al-assad? - Yes.
would you like to review the teleprompter copy before you rehearse?
that would be fine.
I've been trying to reach Tom for the past hour.
is there something I should know?
something you should know, Mr. President?
I know how Tom feels about this address, but I was under the impression that he put his opposition aside and was working with me to make this policy succeed.
well, I'm sure that is a valid impression, Mr. President.
then he'll be here.
Yes. Yes, sir, he will, he will be here.
good.
you try that again and I'll kill you, you understand?
I should kill you anyway.
with the president dead, nobody's going to think too hard about why his chief of staff hanged himself.
here we go for rehearsal.
I'm gonna go and check on Tom, Mr. President.
I'll give you a seven-second countdown.
the last four seconds will be silent.
all right, here we go in seven...
what is this?
bomb!
move, Move... Sir, please XXXXX
fan out. Find him.
got him!
code 5 in sector three. The citadel has been hit.
send a medical team. I repeat, citadel is down.
send a medical team now.
bomb!
emergence president, vice president Daniels is running this country now.
he will implement your security plan.
agent Lowry, these men are responsible for the attempted assassination of the president.
woman: I have the vice president calling for Mr. Buchanan.
bill, I see from the white house flashes that president Palmer granted Charles Logan some kind of furlough.
Logan claims he can help us find Dmitri Gredenko.
how?
through the Russian consulate in Los Angeles.
logan: The bomb that exploded this morning was a Russian suitcase nuclear device supplied to the terrorists by Dmitri Gredenko.
where is he?
I don't know.
yes?
the United States has connected you with terrorists.
the reason we brought the Arabs into this was to conceal our involvement.
now we are exposed.
russia is exposed.
Jack, you just spent nearly two years in a Chinese prison because you violated the sovereignty of their consulate.
now you plan to go back into the Russian consulate and take a chance on that happening again?!
Bauer: How do I find Gredenko?!
M-mojave desert.
what is he doing?
launching drones.
how soon will the drones be ready?
in two hours, all the bombs will be in the air.
don't moving, Now!
the following takes place between 6 pm and 7 pm.
I've got to set the transcript codes for the debrief.
thank you.
who are you?
I'm just Chloe O'brian.
I-I need to do something on this computer.
do you know what's going on with Jack Bauer?
as far as I know, he's still being held in the Russian consulate.
I need to talk to Bill Buchanan right now.
he'll be here after his meeting.
does he know that I'm all alone here in a holding cell?
this isn't really a cell, and you're hardly alone.
this is standard procedure for someone who's under house arrest.
excuse me?
sorry. I-I'm feeling ambivalent.
I'm gonna go.
all right, I want to introduce everyone to Mike Doyle.
he's the new head of field ops, just in from Fort Bragg.
I want all tactical and comm agents to report to him directly.
Jack Bauer's currently being held captive in the Russian consulate.
I haven't opened up that information to anyone on the outside.
Doyle will help you put a tactical profile together for an assault on the consulate.
Milo: So, we're permitted to provoke an international incident just to liberate one of our own operatives?
no. Liberating jack is a secondary goal.
our primary objective is to abduct Anatoly Markov, the consul.
now, according to Jack, Markov knows how to find Gredenko, who controls the remaining three suitcase nukes.
excuse me, but nobody worried that this could be considered an act of war against the Russians?
ultimately, it's the vice president's decision if we go in or not.
but, if Jack is right, and Markov is working with Gredenko, the Russians will have to back down.
sir, Logan is ready for you.
thank you.
I want a comprehensive siege profile on my desk asap.
who has the control keys for the main servers?
uh, I do.
okay, bracket the scenarios into three.
I want projected outcomes based on different levels of personnel.
Milo: Doyle, normally, we run general attack assessment first,
I don't care what you normally do, pressman.
and I wasn't speaking to you.
I was talking with her.
Yeah, that's so weird, 'cause I had this thought that you might come here and not be a jerk, like you were in Denver, but you are.
that's right.
just like Denver.
let's get to work.
I take it you know him?
Yeah. I don't like him very much.
does he know what he's doing?
Yeah, he's good.
what did Buchanan say?
we're ready to move on the consulate, pending White House approval.
is jack on his own?
Yeah.
this is all about getting Markov, not saving Jack.
yeah?
I'm terminating the American.
do you confirm?
Yes.
and you're sure there won't be any political complications?
not if we stick to our story.
the American kills our head of security, tries to escape.
the American has shot Vasili.
he's in the basement.
find him!
agent: Consul Markov?
Yes.
we haven't found the American, but I locked down the perimeter.
there is no way to leave the building.
he can't be allowed to call out.
shut down the phone lines, dsl, everything.
Morris, it's Jack.
I know how to find Gredenko.
he's in the...Morris?
come on! Damn it!
sir, Morris just got a call from Jack.
the line went dead before he could finish, but he says he knows where Gredenko is.
did he trace the call?
he's still inside the consulate.
all right, monitor everything in case he calls back, and tell Doyle Bauer's got key intel, and is no longer dispensable.
got it.
I'm sorry.
we're going to have to reschedule our debrief.
Why?
we have an immediate situation at the Russian consulate.
does this have something to do with Bauer going back in there to question Markov?
please, Bill.
maybe I can help.
Jack was able to get Grendenko's location from Markov.
he tried to call us, but was cut off before he could say more.
he's either being held prisoner in the consulate, or he's being pursued.
then I was right. Markov is involved.
and he will do whatever it takes to keep Jack quiet.
we have to extricate Jack, and failing that, we have to go in and remove Markov and interrogate him ourselves.
we don't have time to go through the red tape.
there's not gonna be any red tape.
I'm launching an assault team.
no, that'S...that is a huge mistake.
Markov will not let himself be taken alive, and he will kill Jack Bauer.
we have to try something.
we're running out of options.
have you tried any pressure from the top?
from-from president Suvarov?
vice president Daniels has spoken to Suvarov.
he's reluctant to act.
it's a diplomatic standoff.
he needs to be convinced to get involved.
I don't know how to do that.
I do.
how?
my ex-wife, Martha.
she became friends with the Suvarovs, especially the wife.
Anya can get through to Yuri.
he listens to her.
they're a very good team.
um, with all due respect, hasn't Mrs. Logan been institutionalized?
that's beside the point.
she's in a unique position to help us.
all right. I'll-I'll...put a call in to her.
bill, let me do it.
Martha can be very difficult.
I think it would be best if I talked to her.
I didn't realize you were on speaking terms.
we're not, but I think I can get through to her.
I know I can.
please, let me try.
that's the way I want it.- Yes
how many on each of those teams?
five.
okay, make it three. More teams, more area covered.
fine.
who's estimating the consulate defense figures?
that would be me.
where are the numbers?
I'm just sorting them before I put them out.
of course you are. Where are the numbers?
Oh, I see. This is about whether or not it takes eight seconds or ten seconds.
there are your numbers sorted three ways.
pick one.
Hey!
do I have your attention?
cause I only want to do this once.
I have 25 soldiers that are about to put their asses on the line.
whether they live or die largely depends on what gets done here.
that's not to mention the larger threat of three nuclear weapons that may be down the street, for all we know.
if anyone has a problem taking orders from me without giving me lip, tell me now, and I will have you reassigned.
you keep your hands off my people.
is that clear?
doyle: They need to understand what I expect from them.
Milo: I know what you expect.
that's all that matters.
you have a problem with somebody on my team, you come to me.
fair enough.
have your "team" merge their results and download it onto my system.
you all right?
the shirt's a blend; it doesn't wrinkle.
you know what I mean.
Yes.
I am all right.
I thought I was a pain in the ass.
the vice president likes you, Tom.
he hopes you have the right answer for him.
well, I hope so, too.
Tom Lennox, man of the hour.
it's all right. You can leave us alone.
so, have you given any thought our earlier conversation?
Yes, I have, sir.
And?
and I agree that the priority here is to protect our country.
and I am prepared to look the other way regarding details of the assassination plot.
to a point.
well, what does that mean?
it means the truth must ultimately come out.
reed and Carson need to be punished for what they did.
and they will.
look, all I'm trying to do is keep America united.
I can't have our critics screaming, "Look at how bad we are. We're worse than the terrorists."
we need to keep our eye on the ball right now.
and on that point, sir, we are in complete agreement.
good, because I need you to tell the ambassador of Assad's country that you saw Assad plant the bomb that injured the president.
sir, looking the other way is one thing, choosing to tell a lie to the ambassador, that becomes a matter of record.
now, you listen to me: If we expect to navigate through this crisis, I need you to cooperate.
Yes, and I would like to cooperate.
I'm still talking!
come on, now, Tom, let's just count our blessings here for a minute.
president Palmer survived this awful attack.
and neither you nor I had anything to do with this heinous plot to kill him.
and the most beautiful fact of all is that we now have the opportunity to implement the correct policy to stop these terrorist lunatics.
can you just put aside your distaste for my methods for one minute and think about the great gift that's been given to us.
I will think long and hard, sir.
good. Now, I need you to tell the ambassador that Assad carried in the bomb.
I'll take it from there.
okay?
okay.
Lisa, get the ambassador clearance and bring him down here.
let doj know that Lennox has been cleared of any wrongdoing and will continue serving as chief of staff.
Yes, sir.
sir, I would like to know what you hope to achieve in your talk with the ambassador.
I want him to know that I hold his country responsible for all of it the nuke and the presidential assassination attempt.
they need to be motivated to reign in these terrorists.
and I want them to know that America is mad as hell and ready to retaliate with a nuclear option, if they don'T.
it's about time he got here.
we need to start loading the bombs.
Mr. Vice president.
bill, you're on speaker. I'm here with Tom Lennox.
what's going on at the Russian consulate?
Jack Bauer's still at large and somewhere inside.
it appears he now also knows Gredenko's location, but isn't able to get it to us.
all right, then what's the plan?
former president Logan believes he can convince his ex-wife to put a call into Anya Suvarov.
he thinks the Russian first lady can get through to her husband.
that's about as likely as the terrorists knocking on my door and surrendering.
I agree.
that's why we've also prepared siege plaN.
a strike force will enter the consulate and extract Markov r interrogatioN.
you realize an attack on a Russian consulate is technically an act of war.
I do, sir.
frankly, I'm reluctant to go the tactical route here.
we got our hands full with these terrorists, we don't need to open up another front with the Russians.
of course, it's your decision, sir.
I understand the politics are sticky, but my responsibility is to stop these nukes.
Markov will not surrender willingly.
we have to go in.
how long will it take you to put together this siege?
about 20 minutes.
all right. Proceed as if you're going in.
if Logan can be effective before then, great.
but don't wait on him.
Yes, sir.
you ready? - Yes.
all right, take your team to their first location, and await our word.
got it.
Martha, It's me.
did you get some rest?
I've been worried about you.
worried about me?
you shouldn't be out driving around with all that fallout in the air.
well, I'm keeping a good distance away.
how are you?
well, I've decided to read my book and listen to music.
I've lived with enough fear over the years.
I don't need anymore.
good for you.
got your magazines.
thank you.
and I stopped by Mel'S.
did you get raspberries?
and blackberries and fresh kiwi.
Oh, oh, thank god for Mel.
what would I do without that man's produce?
Oh, these look beautiful.
Mmm. Ooh, here-- have one.
I'm fine.
come on.
can you get that?
Martha Logan's bungalow.
may I speak to Martha, please?
who is this?
it's Charles, Aaron.
please put her on; it's important.
hold on.
who is it?
it's Charles.
he says it's important.
important to whom?
Mr. Logan, she doesn't want to talk to you.
I heard what she said.
look, listen to me, I'm in ctu in Los Angeles.
I'm here on government business and it has to do with the nuclear attack.
I don't understand how Martha could possibly be of any help.
what you understand really doesn't matter.
I no longer have to tolerate your sarcasm.
please, this was not sarcasm.
something needs to be done.
and, and I think that Martha might be able to help.
I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Logan, but Martha simply doesn't want to speak with you.
she hasn't taken your calls in almost two years.
I don't know why you think she would now.
tell her it's about the Suvarovs.
what?
just do it. Please.
Martha, he wants to ask you... - I told you.
I don't want to talk to him.
it's about the Suvarovs.
what's wrong? Did something happen?
I don't know.
what is it?
is Anya okay?
Anya's fine, Martha.
they're both fine.
then what the hell do you want?
it's a very delicate matter.
there's an international incident brewing and I think that you might be able to help defuse it.
let me get this straight: The government is desperate so they come to you to fix the world and, uh, then you come to me.
I can't be dragged in another drama, with you Charles. I won'T.
you know what's going on today, Martha.
you know that this is important!
this is absurd.
you still there?
Yes, I'm still here.
aaron, you know I wouldn't be playing games on a day like today.
I know.
you need to convince her to see me.
I'm going to take a chopper to you and I'll be there in a few minutes.
all right.
this is Shavers.
Buchanan: Stan, let me talk to Logan.
sir, it's Mr. Buchanan.
Yes, Bill?
we've dispatched personnel to prepare for an assault on the Russian consulate.
bill, attacking the consulate is a huge error in judgment.
this has been decided.
the only way to avoid full-out confrontation with the Russians is for you can get Martha to make the call before we engage.
Slowly...both of you against the wall.
please don't hurt her.
I have no intention of hurting either of you.
but if you don't cooperate, I will kill you.
you understand me?
both of you speak English?
Yes.
I need to make an outside call.
you can'T.
they've cut all communications from the building because you killed Stovich.
I didn't kill Stovich.
I don't believe you.
I don't have to convince you.
we'll do whatever you want.
in case of an emergency, how do you contact the outside world?
please, there's a satcom phone upstairs.
get it and bring it down here.
we're in the middle of a lockdown.
that's your problem.
get me that phone. Now!
okay.
get against the desk.
don't be scared.
you'll be fine.
Hello, Aaron.
Martha's waiting for you.
she's inside.
thank you.
I'll get her.
what's the matter?
apparently she's changed her mind.
I'm sorry, but she doesn't want to see you.
you have to convince her that this is not about us.
this is for the good of the country.
I told her that.
look, if we don't do something in the next few minutes, there's going to be a U. S.- led assault on the Russian consulate here in Los Angeles.
on top of everything else, we will effectively be at war with Russia.
MARTHA: You've lost weight.
so this is the new, improved Charles Logan.
reborn.
you look beautiful.
what do you want?
I need you to call Anya Suvarov.
what do you want me to say to her?
she has to convince Yuri to order the Russian consul general, here in Los Angeles, to surrender himself.
and why wod he do that?
because the man-- his name is Anatoly Markov he's a criminal and he's working outside of Russian authority.
so what?
he's also a mass murderer.
the bomb that went off this morning in Valencia was supplied to the terrorists with Markov's help.
there are other bombs out there.
he knows where they are.
why doesn't the White House just contact Yuri directly?
they did. It didn't work.
why not?
Martha, this is very complicated.
please don't make me explain everything in details
Oh, oh, oh...I'm sorry; just do what you say without asking.
I'm sorry.
you haven't changed a bit.
look at this. Look at this!
I'm still under arrest.
after this is over, I go back to prison.
I'm just trying to help.
prison?
is that what you call a 10, 000-square-foot house with a swimming pool and tennis court?
Yuri has to be convinced that this man Markov is a traitor to his country.
Anya can make our case for us.
you're the only person who can reach her fast.
do you think I should do this?
Yes, I do.
I need a drink.
not that knocking me off the wagon would be a small price to pay for saving the world.
get Anya on the phone.
I'll talk to her.
how far are you from the Russian consulate?
we'll be there in a few minutes.
has there been any change of plans?
no. As far as I know, the assault on the consulate is still a go.
I'm about to talk to Buchannan now.
call me if anything changes.
okay.
have a seat, Mr. Ambassador.
thank you.
how is president Palmer?
well...the president's a tough man.
he's injured, but we're confident he'll make a full recovery.
what a tragic and despicable act.
I agree.
what makes it even more troubling is that a citizen of your country, Hamri Al-assad, was responsible for the assassination attempt.
I understand that Assad lost his life in the blast.
but I was led to believe that he was working with president Palmer to promote a peace plan.
well, I'm afraid that was all a ruse, Mr. Ambassador.
assad's real intentions became clear when he detonated the explosive.
you have proof of this?
conclusive.
forensic evidence, as well as at least one eyewitness who saw the detonator in Assad's hand immediately before the explosion.
isn't that right, Tom?
Yes, sir, that is correct.
even if what you say is true, you must know that Hamri Al-assad was not working at the behest of our government.
he was as much a wanted man in our country as he was in yours.
Oh, not as much.
but that's gonna change.
what are you referring to?
the terrorists presently on U. S. soil are acting under the orders of citizens in your country who have the support of your government.
I know it and you know it.
that is simply not true.
I say it is.
and I'm willing to bet you that I'm right.
what do you mean?
I have a carrier group within striking distance of every major city in your country, waiting for me to give the order.
you would attack us?
abu Fayed, a citizen of your country, enters the United States and detonates a nuclear bomb, killing thousands.
next, Assad attempts to assassinate the president.
we cannot be held responsible.
you know fully well that we have cooperated with you since the inception of this crisis.
these threats against us are reckless and counterproductive.
I had an understanding with your president.
and now you're going to have one with me.
you help us find those nukes before another goes off or I'm going to unleash the full power of our military on your country.
all right, keep me posted.
Doyle is approaching the staging area.
we can in the consulate in less than 15 minutes.
it's going to come right down to the wire.
what do you mean?
Charles, Logan and I are trying to arrange a phone call between his ex-wife Martha and Anya Suvarov.
when?
Mrs. Suvarov's giving a speech right now in Omsk.
we have to wait till she's finished.
even if S. Logan can get through to Anya, it's going to take her some time to convince her husband to change his mind.
I agree.
it's a long shot.
it shouldn't take much longer.
I don't understand. This is important.
why don't they just interrupt her speech?
it's Russian politics.
there's nothing we can do.
fine.
it's gonna be a few more minutes.
Pierce: What's the matter, hon?
this is taking forever.
I know.
Aaron...you promise you'll stand by me, en if I can't go through with this?
of course I will.
Martha, I'm sorry.
the last thing I wanted to do was upset you.
funny, you always manage to get to that last thing.
let me ask you something, Charles.
does it bother you to see me with another man?
Martha, please.
we may as well talk to fill the time.
we never really had any closure.
well?
Yes. It's very difficult.
if you want to know the truth.
but you've had a rebirth.
you should be happy for my happiness.
I am happy for you, Martha.
I'm sure you are.
you know, Charles, Aaron has taken such good care of me.
I don't know what I did to deserve such a good man.
I never knew what that was before.
a really good man.
Martha, if it makes you feel better to insult me, please feel free.
I didn't come here to fight with you.
it does make me feel better.
I can say exactly I want, finally, without having to worry about incurring your wrath.
the great Charles Logan.
the president of the universe.
the great leader. The murderer.
Martha, I want you to stop this right now.
you're going to get all stirred up.
Oh, well, god, we couldn't have that, could we?
Mr. Logan, if you'd be more comfortable waiting outside, I'd understand.
I appreciate that, Aaron, but I think I'll stay right here.
actually, I'm very thankful that you've been able to be here for Martha.
you are a good man.
she's very lucky to have you.
now you're trying to irritate me, aren't you?
no, Martha, no.
I'm not.
Oh, cut the crap.
with the sincerity, the new enlightened soul.
at least you used to be an honest crook.
Pierce: That's enough. Please.
sorry. I'll be a good little girl.
Oh, my god.
we need a medic in here right now!
you must've hit an artery.
we need a medic in here right now!
agent Foley, get in here now!
somebody, come on!
MEDIC: He's going in to shock.
let's get him out of here. Now.
it happened too fast, Bill.
I couldn't stop her.
Buchanan: There's nothing we can do about it, Aaron.
right now, I've been ordered by the vice president to send an assault team into the Russian consulate, unless president Suvarov intercedes.
I understand.
is Martha capable of having a coherent conversation with Anya Suvarov?
honestly, I don't know.
Chloe's putting the call through any second. Find out.
will do.
why are they doing this to me?
I should be given a medal.
he was one of the biggest criminals in history.
they gave him house arrest.
Martha, we're still in a crisis situation.
are you able to handle a conversation with Anya Suvarov?
of course, I am. I'm not crazy.
I know what the stakes are.
are you sure?
Mr. Pierce, ctu's got Anya Suvarov on the line for Mrs. Logan.
they're putting it through now.
do you know what you're going to say?
Anya, it's Martha.
how are you?
I'm fine.
I've been worried about you there in California.
stop worrying; everything's gonna be fine.
I know we have a lot to catch up on, but I'm going to have to be rude and get right to the point.
there's not a lot of time.
what is it?
if you've talked to Yuri recently, you know there's a very tense situation going on at the Russian consulate in Los Angeles.
I've heard something about that, but don't know the details.
the details are very important, Anya.
please, tell me more.
the Americans stepped on Russian soil and took me hostage.
we will sort out the details later.
right now, I am ordering you to surrender to the Americans and deliver Jack Bauer, unharmed.
I am afraid I cannot do that, Mr. President.
how dare you disobey a direct order.
you will do exactly as I tell you!
Mr. Buchanan, consul Markov is not cooperating.
you understand, Mr. President, this leaves me with very few options.
I do.
I will personally authorize the use of force against the consulate.
the United States of America has the support of the Russian state in this matter.
thank you, Mr. President.
I got it. Get over here.
is anybody gonna notice this missing?
in a few minutes, yes.
make your call.
did he hurt you?
no.
it needs the unlock code.
Doyle, Suvarov just gave us the go-ahead.
go!
are you hit?
no.
yes?
it's Markov.
the Americans are coming in.
I thought you had that under control.
no.
won't be long before they have your position.
hold them off as long as you can.
I will.
but you must launch now.
drop your weapon!
my name is Jack Bauer.
this man needs medical attention.
they're not hostiles.
okay, send medics to the basement.
I'm Mike Doyle.
you need to contact Bill Buchanan.
tell him that Fayed and Gredenko are in the Shadow valley.
patch me in with Buchanan.
this drone is ready to launch.
arm the bomb.
got it.
put all the satellite coverage we have on Shadow valley.
sir, stay still.
we'll have you to the hospital in a minute.
sir, please don't try to talk.
he's starting to crash.
we're losing him.
I'll in your country, United States, a nuclear bomb killing thousands of Americans president.
you know
I had an understanding president.
now you gotta have one with me you off at least power your country the American - - yes
the American has shot Vasili. He's in the basement.
shut down the phone lines, DSL, everything!
Morris, it's Jack.
I know how to find Gredenko. He's in the...
Jack Bauer's currently being held captive in the Russian consulate.
Doyle will help you put a tactical profile together for an assault on the consulate.
our primary objective is to abduct Anatoly Markov, the consul.
according to Jack, Markov knows how to find Gredenko, who controls the remaining three suitcase nukes.
the Americans are coming in.
I thought you had that under control.
won't be long before they have your position.
this drone is ready to launch.
arm the bomb.
what's going on at the Russian consulate?
Jack Bauer's still at large and somewhere inside.
we have to go in.
drop your weapon!
my name is Jack Bauer. You need to contact Bill Buchanan.
tell him that Fayed and Gredenko are in the Shadow Valley.
patch me in with Buchanan.
the FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN 7: 00 P. M. AND 8: 00 P. M. Medevac's on the way. How you holding up?
I'm fine.
doc?
he may have floating rib fragments which could cause internal bleeding.
he needs to be stabilized.
agent Doyle, I told you I'm fine. I want to be involved in this mission.
CTU has the ball, Jack. Right now, this is out of your hands.
we now believe Gredenko is in possession of at least five RQ-2 aerial drones:
somewhere in Shadow Valley.
unmanned stealth aircraft which can be remotely piloted from anywhere in the world.
and Gredenko's arming them with the nuclear weapons he provided to Fayed?
Yes, sir.
we're redirecting satellite coverage over the Mojave desert, and the air force is scrambling F-16s from Edwards.
but you have no idea how close Fayed and Gredenko are to launching these drones?
no, sir, we don't.
: all right, Bill. You keep me updated.
Yes, sir.
bring the trucks around. We are moving out now.
what's wrong?
how many drones have been armed?
just this one. - Damn it.
we need to launch it now.
get it ready.
go, go.
tell me what's wrong.
what's wrong? - The Americans know our location.
how?
it was Markov, huh?
Markov told them.
all that matters is that they know we are here.
we need to launch the drone before they close in.
we have three bombs and three targets.
we'll find a way to deliver the other two bombs.
all this time we've tolerated your condescension, berating us for losing the other bombs.
but now it's your fault. Markov was your man.
blame me all you want, but if we stay here, we'll be captured or killed.
refit the other bombs into their casings and load them on the truck.
do it now! Take them out!
we're accelerating our schedule.
Why?
I don't have time to explain.
I need you to launch drone 0-7-0-9.
I haven't finished implementing the evasion vectors.
they'll shoot it down before it reaches its target.
launch the drone.
you'll execute evasion tactics once it's in the air.
Yes, sir.
we need to leave now.
come on, let's go.
we're repositioning our satellites as fast as we can, sir.
as soon as we make visual contact, we'll uplink a real-time feed to your command.
just get me that intel.
Yes, sir.
you okay?
the truth? No, not really.
Hey. We're going to get through this, okay?
I hope so.
is there a problem, Chloe? - Yeah.
are you going to tell us what it is?
I was installing security upgrades, and I noticed you were using Milo's clearance code.
which, in case you didn't know, is a felony security breach.
no, it must be a mistake. My system's been glitchy, and I think I...
it's not a glitch, Milo.
Nadia's been working with your user I. D.
so unless she stole it, you gave it to her.
Milo was just trying to help me do my work.
homeland Security sent down an order restricting my security access because I was born in the Middle East.
I've heard of that directive, and I think it's wrong for us to be racially profiling our own agents, but it's still a felony security breach for you to be using Milo's code.
look, we...
if you report this, we can't help the situation if we're fired and arrested.
if I wanted to report you, I wouldn't be talking to you.
I'm telling you this so that you'll be careful.
I mean, I noticed it. Someone else is going to notice it sooner or later.
Yes, sir.
Morris has a satellite visual on Shadow Valley.
it looks like the terrorists have launched a single drone.
I'm conferencing with general Walsh now.
I'll be right there, sir. Coordinate with first-responders in all target zones.
put general Walsh through. - You're on with Bill Buchanan, sir.
this is Walsh.
general, we've made visual contact with a single drone. We're tracking it on satellite.
it's heading on a northwest vector out of Shadow Valley.
altitude is 3, 300 feet and climbing.
velocity is 360 miles an hour.
I'm looking at the specs on the RQ-2 now.
it's got a low-profile design, virtually impossible to detect by radar.
we'll need to manually guide our F-16s to intercept.
we're uplinking a video feed to you now.
have you determined its intended target?
Yes. This is Nadia Yassir. The closest target is downtown Los Angeles.
that's a four-minute window.
maximum airspeed of an RQ-2 is 400 miles per hour.
my F-16s should be able to intercept it within two minutes.
that may be a problem.
I can't find the drone.
the drone's gone. - How can it be gone?
it was passing between grids, but when I switched satellites...
readjust based on projected vectors.
I'm doing that now, general, it's just not where it's supposed to be.
until you find it, I'll have my F-16s stay in a holding pattern.
yes?
I've accessed our connection to CTU.
I've disabled their tracking capability.
then they cannot detect the drone?
no.
and I'll be able to keep it hidden from their satellites until we've hit the target.
good.
I'll contact you again once we are out of the area.
sir, I was just talking to Bill Buchanan at CTU.
they were tracking one of the drones. They've now lost visual contact with it.
lost visual contact? - Yeah, it's unclear just how, sir.
they just simply can't find it.
we have the most sophisticated satellite network in the world. How the hell did this happen?
CTU is still trying to determine that, sir. - What about the military?
well, they've got three squadrons looking for it, but these drones are invisible to radar, so the pilots are limited to making visual ID at night over hundreds of square miles.
now, CTU has a ranked list of potential targets.
they're running civil disaster scenes...
sir?
advance the meeting with the joint chiefs.
when do you want it to happen?
right away.
wait, sir.
why... why are we assembling the joint chiefs?
I warned the ambassador, Tom.
you heard me tell him that I'd hold his country responsible if another nuclear weapon was detonated on our soil.
sir, there's absolutely no evidence that his country either sponsored these attacks or is even in support of them.
his people need to understand that
I'm not just rattling my saber.
they need to see with their own eyes that
I will answer this threat with an in-kind military response.
wait.
in kind," sir?
I want the joint chiefs to draw up our own target list for a nuclear strike.
I won't let another attack go unanswered, Tom.
at its rated speed, the drone should have reached Los Angeles, so we can eliminate us as a target.
in the next few minutes, I can take Santa Barbara and San Diego off the list.
how many targets does that leave within the drone's range?
counting cities with populations over a million...
fifteen.
we have to narrow it down.
assuming they want the maximum civilian death toll, how many likely targets within the drone's range?
areas with the highest population density are San Francisco, Las Vegas and Phoenix.
confirm that nuclear teams and first responders have deployed in those cities.
Morris, make sure the air force prioritizes their search on that basis.
Yup.
give me the projected coordinates.
bill, did we pick up Gredenko? - We're working on it.
bill, what happened? - Grenko escaped.
but not before launching one of the drones.
how close is the air force to intercepting it?
f-16s were minutes away, then the drone disappeared from the satellite grid;
we're still looking for it.
get to medical. There's nothing you can do here.
just keep me informed, please. - I will.
Doyle, I want you to run point on the search for Fayed and Gredenko.
Milo's monitoring from the situation room. I'll be right there.
I'll see you over at medical.
Hey. - Hey.
could we have a moment, please?
they said you were hurt. - I'm, I'm fine.
as soon as all of this is over, I'll come by and check on you and Josh.
I always regretted things didn't work out between us...
and...
I always believed you did, too.
maybe I was wrong.
no, you weren't.
listen, Marilyn, before I was taken prisoner by the Chinese...
I, I was with someone.
she doesn't even know I'm still alive, but...
I need to talk to her...
see what happens.
are you talking about Audrey Raines?
Yeah.
you don't know. Do you?
Jack, I'M...
I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this...
Audrey's dead.
I don't know all the details,
I just know what I read in the paper about her accident.
what accident? When?
it was a few months ago.
it was a car accident.
somewhere in China.
china.
excuse me. I'm sorry.
I have to go.
there'll be separate channels open for all first responders in at-risk cities...
all first responders should coordi...
why the hell didn't anybody tell me about Audrey?
Mr. Buchanan didn't want to tell you when you first got back, because we all thought Fayed was just going to kill you.
but I probably should have.
I'm sorry.
she was in China looking for me?
she was the one who figured out the Chinese had taken you.
apparently she spent the past year going through back channels, to try to get you out.
the rest of it's classified by division, I don't know any more.
we were asked to send the DNA records, so that they could get a positive id on the remains...
which I guess they did.
I want that file.
all right, Jack. - Now!
I have to dig it up in archives. - Just do it.
the secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs will be attending in person, the state will be monitoring via satellite.
and the rest of the cabinet will be provided with video transcripts.
good.
you should also know that Karen Hayes will be attending.
I thought I told you I wanted her excluded from this.
she supported Wayne Palmer's policy of appeasement.
she's going to be a problem.
well, there was nothing I could do. She's still acting national security advisor.
but I've only given her current circumstances.
any objection to your plans will not be able to gain traction.
Oh, I've known Karen Hayes for many years.
it's always been a mistake to underestimate her.
Hello, Tom.
somebody push you down the stairs?
no, Karen, I tripped over your ineptitude.
on that subject, welcome back.
look, Tom, I don't want to play games.
I won't let you blackmail me again.
so you do what you need to do, I am here to represent the president,
and I intend to stay. - All right, fair enough.
no one is sorrier than I am about what happened to Wayne.
well, at least we have that in common.
please be seated.
as many of you are already aware,
the terrorist who attacked us this morning, Abu Fayed, with the help of Dmitri Gredenko, has launched an aerial drone that we believe is armed with another nuclear bomb.
efforts are ongoing to locate this drone.
but should those efforts fail, we are looking at a second nuclear attack on our country in less than ten hours.
and I am determined not to let this attack happen without a military response on our part.
a military response directed against whom, Mr. Vice president?
we were under the impression that these terrorists were essentially stateless.
secretary Kanin, that is the fiction they hide behind.
but...
everyone in this room knows that elements within Abu Fayed's country train and fund terrorist organizations like his.
it is time to hold them accountable.
the ambassador has just been informed that if the nuclear weapon on that drone detonates, we will retaliate with our own nuclear strike.
now this will be a warning shot, not a full-scale attack.
the joint chiefs have been instructed to identify an unpopulated area where there will be limited civilian casualties.
Admiral.
the closest match we have to that scenario is territory near their northern border.
we believe this should result in fewer than 2, 000 deaths.
long-term damage from radioactive fallout, however, could double that number, depending on ground conditions.
I can accept that.
Mr. Vice president, I'm sure you're aware that our intelligence suggests that their government can't control Fayed either.
they are doing the best that they can.
and I'm saying they need to figure out a way to do better.
something tells me that once this bomb hits, they will.
if this bomb hits, the opposite will hold true.
the moderates will be driven from power, the terrorists' position will be strengthened there and in the region, and I don't hear anyone talking about the Chinese or Russian response to this.
we could start another world war.
if I thought there was a high likelihood of that, I wouldn't be suggesting this.
Mr. Vice president, the stakes are too high for this decision to be based on your personal judgment.
it is my opinion that this course of action would be dangerous and reckless.
consider your concern registered, Karen.
but the debate is over
america must start to stand up for herself.
the attacks on this country must stop!
and as acting commander in chief, I believe this is the best way to make that happen.
Admiral, have a nuclear strike sub standing by.
Yes, Mr. Vice president.
I never, oh you Morris - - yeah I don't think so. Hey, what are you doing?
on intel, okay?
Morris is better?
is that a question?
is he? - yes.
favor - I need you to check if by thanks - what - just check your breath he's fine.
thank you
Yes, Karen, I hear you.
you can't possibly be in favor of Daniels' plan for a nuclear strike.
you heard the vice president.
it's a warning shot into an unpopulated area.
it is a military offensive on foreign soil.
and you and I both know it will be impossible to contain.
Tom, you know this is insane, I know you do.
I saw you in that meeting.
I saw the doubt in your eyes.
do not presume to know what I am thinking or feeling.
I serve at the discretion of those above me.
you serve the interests of the president.
and you know that Wayne would not sign off on this course of action.
Wayne was wrong.
every decision he made today was wrong
rejecting my security initiatives, using Assad as an appeal to extremist groups.
and look what we've been led to!
you can't seriously believe that.
you just cannot!
doesn't matter what I believe.
as long as the president is in a coma, Daniels is the acting commander in chief.
now, if you want him to abort that missile launch, you had better pray that CTU can find and stop that drone.
we've got ground teams on all roads leading out of Shadow Valley looking for Fayed and Gredenko, but with sat support dedicated to finding the drone, there's not much to go on.
and caltrans doesn't have any cameras set up in the outlying areas.
Mr. Buchanan, we figured out how the drone is able to stay hidden from our satellites.
whoever is piloting it is able to anticipate our repositioning directives, flying through the gaps in the images.
how can he do that?
chloe: Our satellite data is being relayed to the drone pilot through a workstation here.
we have a leak.
one of our own people?
looks that way.
can you isolate the workstation?
no. It's being masked through a sub-circuit.
Morris is working on it now, but there are over 50 stations in this building.
it could take an hour to do a signature trace.
we don't have an hour.
run a trace match on Nadia Yassir's station.
why Nadia?
do it.
wait, you think just because she's a muslim, that gives you the right...
I'm following standard protocol.
she's already been tagged and given restricted clearance.
and, yeah, she is a muslim.
that's enough to go on.
everyone here is thinking it, even if they won't say it.
you're a racist.
Buchanan: Milo, I understand your distaste.
but we have to vet every system in the building.
there's no reason not to start with hers.
no, sir, there's every reason.
Nadia Yassir's 100 percent loyal to this country.
she is not a terrorist.
is this assessment based on some private knowledge?
or is it because you're itching to sleep with her?
son of A...
all right! That's enough!
agent Doyle, that was way out of line.
we don't have time for your personal differences.
we have to find out who's subverting our system.
it is Nadia.
the signature trace matches her computer.
shut down her workstation.
I'm trying. The only way to cut the data flow is to reboot CTU's mainframe.
we'd be without system power for more than 20 minutes.
get security on the floor now.
surrender your station.
excuse me?
who are you streaming our satellite data to?
What?! - Where is the pilot?
Doyle, damn it, that's enough!
take her to holding.
bill, don't let, don't let him do this!
bill, I'm innocent!
I'm not a traitor!
Morris, secure her station.
see if you can run a back trace on that leak.
find out where the feed is going.
excuse me.
Victor. What is the drone's current position?
130 miles southeast of target.
have you locked in the GPS coordinates?
Yes.
the bomb will detonate over San Francisco within 20 minutes.
Yes.
15ccAdin some glucose after about an hour.
if you see anything, any movement, twitch of the eyelids, you get me.
got it? - Yes, sir
Dr. Welton, I need to speak with you.
I don't have much time, Ms.Hayes.
what's the president's condition?
it's worsened in the last 15 minutes.
there was a buildup of intracranial pressure.
we had to induce a coma to relieve the swelling.
I see.
good news is we stopped it in time.
doesn't seem to have been any neural damage, and his vitals are surprisingly strong.
he's a fighter.
we have that much going for us.
excuse me.
doctor... - yes.
is there any way that you can bring the president back to consciousness?
I know this is an unusual request, but it's a matter of national security that I speak with him.
I'm sorry.
it could pose a serious risk to his life.
I couldn't possibly authorize it.
who could?
I'd need consent from his family.
his sister is here.
but I would strongly advise against it.
if the swelling isn't contained, the president could suffer permanent brain damage.
I have to go, Ms.Hayes.
this is insane.
Nadia can't be involved in this.
the signal was routed through her station.
we can't ignore that fact.
do you really believe that Nadia is helping the terrorists?
I don't want to believe it, but I really don't know.
Doyle's an ass.
he's doing his job.
if we want him to stop, we have to prove she's innocent.
hello.
think I got something.
what is it?
I've set up a feedback pulse.
whoever Nadia's feeding our data stream to will read it as some static in the line, but we may be able to ride the pulse back to its source, find the location of the drone pilot.
I've got it.
1530 Hillcrest.
Hillcrest, that's close.
bloody close-- three blocks away.
okay, tell Buchanan.
I'm asking you once again, cooperate.
help me put an end to this.
I'm warning you.
I will do what's necessary to get the answers I need.
do you understand?
do you understand?
I understand everything.
I read your file.
I know what you did in Denver.
you enjoy hurting people.
you get off on it.
we' not here to talk about me.
we're here to talk about what you know.
I don't know anything!
Milo: Get away from her, Doyle.
I said let her go.
what the hell are you doing?
we got the drone pilot's location through Nadia's computer.
where is it?
three blocks from here.
1530 Hillcrest.
we're not through with her, Milo.
are you okay?
you know I didn't have anything to do with this.
get out of here.
agent, what's going on?
we have a location on the drone's pilot.
we're mobilizing now.
Buchanan: As you know, whoever's piloting the drone is operating in close proximity to CTU.
I'm instituting a level one security lock-down.
all provisional safeguards are in effect until further notice.
let's go to work!
Marcy...Contact LAPD.
have them coordinate with tactical.
seal off a perimeter.
Yes, sir.
Chloe...have they confirmed the address?
Yes, it's a relay station.
I've got the building specs and layout.
I'm gonna need a pda and a phone.
I'll get them for you. - Thanks.
Jack, what are you doing?
I'm going with the team.
you're injured.
you should be in medical.
you should have told me about Audrey, Bill.
we were asking you to give your life, Jack.
I didn't think it was right to tell you about Audrey's accident.
it wasn't an accident. She was murdered.
no one knows that for sure. - I do.
bill, Audrey gave her life trying to get me out of a Chinese prison because she thought I was worth it.
I'm not going to let her die for nothing now.
I'm going to finish this.
and when I do, I'm gonna track down the people responsible for her murder, and I'm going to take care of them, too.
please, you have to let me finish this.
all right.
I'll tell Doyle you're running point.
thank you.
the drone is approaching the city.
I'm beginning descent now.
how long until the bomb detonates?
at its current speed, the drone will reach the target perimeter within three minutes.
it will detonate automatically when it reaches the perimeter line.
I'll bring it in at an altitude of 500 feet to achieve maximum damage.
don't worry, tovarish, everything is set.
it will happen exactly as you planned.
concentrate on the task at hand.
then call me when it's done.
Yes, sir.
bill, it's Jack. We're in position.
the gate was open, there's a utility UCK parked behind the building.
our back-trace shows the intrusion into our system is coming from a room in the northwest corner of the switching station.
Jack, I'm looking at an updated schematic now.
your most direct route is through the rear entrance, to the left.
okay. Did you get that? - Yeah.
do you want me on point?
I got it.
let's go.
whatever you say.
what was that? Go check.
let's get a medic.
Chloe, it's Jack. Do you copy?
we copy.
Jack, what's your status?
the drone pilot is down.
I'm at his controls now.
the target is San Francisco.
I repeat, the target is San Francisco.
alert local law enforcement and first responders in the area, and open a channel with the regional control center up there.
got it.
these controls are for navigation only.
there is no way to deactivate the bomb remotely.
CTU, we're linking you in now.
you should have it.
it's coming through.
Jack, is there any way for you to determine what triggering mechanism they're using?
it looks like they wired a GPS module into the bomb.
it'll detonate as soon as it crosses its designated perimeter.
I'm trying to steer it away now.
don't turn the drone too sharply, or it'll stall, and you'll lose control.
copy that.
on its current course, the drone will cross the perimeter and detonate in 30 seconds.
Jack, you're getting a stabilizer warning.
I see it.
20 seconds.
ten seconds.
okay, it's turning.
the drone did not cross the perimeter.
I'm fighting a stall.
I'm losing control of the drone.
I need to find a place to land it now.
all right, according to the specs, it's gonna need 500 feet of runway to land.
okay, closest to the drone's current position, there's a long stretch of residential road straight ahead of you.
that's a negative.
find me an area that's unpopulated.
hold on.
if you can get the drone farther east, there's an industrial park along the bay.
I'm uploading the coordinates now.
have regional command deploy units to the area immediately.
regional command...come on.
the drone is down.
Mr. Buchanan, none of the first responders in San Francisco are reporting a detonation.
the bomb did not go off on impact.
Jack, did you copy that?
Yeah.
can we get a visual from anyone at the site?
I'm showing a fire and rescue unit already arriving at the scene.
what's the status on the pilot?
he's alive, barely.
do whatever you have to to get him conscious.
get the geiger counter.
move out!
there's radioactive material in this area!
pull back and wait for hazmat.
move it!
sir, I have Bill Buchanan on line one.
bill, what do you have?
Mr. Vice president, the drone was intercepted before the nuclear bomb was able to detonate.
Oh, thank god.
congratulations, sir.
we were able to take control of the aircraft, crash-landing it in an industrial park at the edge of the city.
but in the process, the bomb's nuclear core was compromised, and radioactive material was released.
so what we're essentially dealing with is a dirty bomb.
sir, this was not a dispersal device.
it was a radiological spill.
it was an attack on our nation.
bill, are there casualties?
local responders got there before hazmat.
they were almost certainly exposed to fatal doses of radiation, but so far, it appears that radioactive material was not widely dispersed.
casualties should be minimal.
at least we've got that to be grateful for.
Thanks, Bill.
proceed with the warning strike as planned.
sir, the primary attack was averted.
CTU was successful.
there will be civilian deaths, as well as untold environmental damage.
I hardly consider that a success.
the damage will be minimal compared to what we just avoided.
sir, I think we should consider ourselves fortunate.
Tom? Sir?
Mr. Vice president, we were led to believe that this warning shot would be fired only in response to the detonation of a nuclear device.
that is a technicality, Tom.
I gave fair warning to the prime minister, and I intend to carry it out.
secretary Kanin?
how long will it take to move the submarine into position?
once you've given the order...
within the hour.
the order is given.
launch the missile...
as soon as they're in range.
we have a successful launch.
good.
Mr. President, my government has alerted me of the nuclear weapon heading toward my country.
that's correct, Mr. Ambassador, we've made good on our threat.
we've identified a general in our central command-- general mohmar habib, who has also been in contact with fayed.
he's been helping orchestrate that attacks on your country.
I really hope protecting this man was worth pushing us to the brink of World War III.
I've never found pharmaceutical torture all that affective.
I have.
if this is supposed to frighten me, you're wasting your time.
I won't tell you a thing.
watch out!
we staged a fake rescue of fayed by CTU agents posing as members of a terrorist cell with loyalties to habib.
he wants us to help you rendezvous with your men.
where do you want us to take you?
if you take your orders from general habib as I do, how is it I've never heard of you?
Fayed's gone!
Jamal's still alive.
stay with him, call in a medic.
CTU, the bombs are secure.
Hello? Jack, are you there?
can you hear me?
help me, Jack.
Hello, Mr. Bauer.
Yes, Ms. Raines is alive.
if you wish her to remain that way, you will call me back in ten minutes.
if you make any attempt to find our location, she dies.
cheng.
the following takes place between 11PM&12AM.
agent Bauer, you really do need to get to a hospital.
but I understand the circumstances.
at least this will help you with the pain.
thank you.
Hey, Jack, so the marines, they're going to secure the nukes and prepare them for transport.
they're calling the shots now.
the military's taking over?
Yeah, according to presidential order.
I guess DOD doesn't want CTU in charge anymore.
so Buchanan, he wants you to call him as soon as the nukes are ready for transport to a NEST facility.
can you handle that for me?
sure.
what?
I just...I know you've been through hell.
not just today, but the last couple of years, and...
I just wanted to thank you for what you did today, because it could have ended a hell of a lot worse.
and it would have if you weren't here.
I appreciate that.
excuse me. This is Bauer, let me speak to Audrey.
you've already spoken to her.
I want to make sure she's all right.
her well-being is entirely up to you, Mr. Bauer.
everyone has given up on you. Everyone, except for Ms. Raines.
over the objections of your government, her family, her friends, she came to Beijing, just to find you.
since you proved to be a uncooperative prisoner, we felt she would be an asset we might be able to exploit one day.
and that day is here.
I will hand myself over to you.
tell me where.
a man who won't break is of no use to us, but the Russian suitcase nukes you captured...
why your country has the technology to build those weapons？
it's not the weapons themselves we're interested in.
what we want is a component from the triggering mechanism.
it contains a prototype algorithm old enough to be free of any modern decryption safeguards.
with it, we'll have access to virtually all Russian defense technology.
it's a simple exchange.
you give me the component, I give you Audrey.
if you refuse, I kill her.
the Russians will know that we supplied you with the algorithm.
you would be starting World War III.
I suggest we leave that to the diplomats to sort out.
even if I wanted to, the bombs are under military control.
I couldn't get anywhere near them.
you'll find a way.
if I'm going to agree to this, I want to speak to Audrey now.
very well. Speak to him.
are you all right?
did they hurt you？ No. Jack...I...I'm sorry.
you have nothing to be sorry for.
the only thing that's important is that you're alive.
I know what they're asking for.
I can handle it.
I promise you, I'm going to get you out of there. Just don't be frightened.
you have one hour to call this number when you're ready to make the exchange.
an hour's not going to give me enough time.
cheng.
cheng!
you know, you really should work from medical, sir.
come on, at least they can monitor you there.
I'm fine, Tom.
I don't think that you are, sir.
and neither does Dr. Welton.
putting myself under medical supervision might give the vice president yet another pretext to try and take a run at my job.
you don't need to worry about that, sir.
what exactly do you have on vice president Daniels?
I have the truth, sir.
now is the time that I need to know what that is.
it is a tape recording of vice president Daniels conspiring with Lisa Miller to commit perjury at your competency hearing.
I'd love to hear that as soon as possible.
Mr. President, Tom. I have good news.
CTU has recovered the two remaining suitcase nukes.
when?
just a few minutes ago.
I just got off the phone with Bill.
he's waiting to brief you as soon as you're ready.
what about Fayed?
he and his men were killed during the assault.
then it's over.
well, it certainly seems so, sir. Congratulations.
the American people should know.
and I want to tell them that we're no longer at risk of a nuclear attack.
I'll have the press corps down here in 30 minutes.
no, no, Karen. We're going to do this from upstairs, in the press room.
should we wait for clearance from secret service?
no, Tom, there's no need for any of us to be hiding underground for a minute longer.
inform secret service that we'll be leaving the bunker and returning to the oval office.
Yes, sir.
Morris is coordinating with the marines technical escort unit to transfer the bombs to a NEST facility.
now that they've taken custody, I'd like you all to submit your briefings to the respective department heads.
I'd like to share my pride in the work that you've all done.
we were hit hard. But not one of you gave up.
you've done excellent work today.
Hey, it's me. Jack. You did it.
Chloe, listen to me. I need your help.
well, can't it wait?
we're just transferring the bombs, and doing cleanup.
no, it can't.
what is it?
Chloe, Audrey's still alive.
no, she's not.
Yes, she is, I just talked to her.
the Chinese faked her car accident. They've been holding her a prisoner since she was in beijing trying to find me.
Oh, my god.
we have to tell Mr. Buchanan.
he'll never go along with it.
go along with what?
the Chinese want to exchange audrey for an feedback circuit board from one of the nukes.
it'll give them complete access to Russian defense technology.
I want you to help me retrieve one of those circuit boards.
Jack, we both know that if we do this, it will create an international situation big time.
Chloe, I know.
I promise I will do whatever I have to to stop the Chinese from getting that circuit board.
but right now I need you to get me the schematics for those bombs.
those files aren't on my system.
they were reclassified when the DOD took possession of the suitcase nuke you disarmed.
then you're going to have to figure out a way to get them, because without those schematics, I won't know what I'm looking for.
Yes, I understand, but I don't know how I can do this.
Chloe, Audrey's life is at stake.
think.
wait. He had to file a report with DOD about the work he did on the nukes.
it contained a revised schematic.
it might still be on his hard drive.
can you access it?
only directly from his terminal.
Chloe, please, do it.
where do you want me to send it?
to the cell phone that I'm calling you from.
use a secure line--Alpha-539.
hold on.
it's here. The file's coming up.
I'm sending it to your screen. Stand by.
copy that.
come on.
Chloe, I don't see anything.
it needs to load before it sends.
there's still 30% to go. Damn it.
what?
Morris is coming back to his station.
hurry.
there's nothing I can do.
I need to log out now. He's here.
no, Chloe, wait.
I got it.
yes? Mr. President, the vice president is here.
send him in.
please sit.
listen, I,uh...I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to you.
for a lesson well learned.
I'm not sure what you mean by that, Mr. President.
I still believe attacking ABU Fayed's country with a nuclear weapon would have been a serious mistake, Noah; I'm not going lie to you about that.
but...
if you hadn't put that option on the table in the first place, I never would've gone as far as I did.
and the bombs might still be out there.
that being said...I think we would both agree that our relationship has always been a marriage of convenience.
a way to strengthen the ticket, rather than a case of us actually seeing eye to eye on pretty much anything.
and now that it's over, this crisis, it's become clear to me, Noah, that I just don't think it's possible for us to work together anymore.
excuse me?
I'm asking for your resignation.
how dare you.
you don't have the right to ask for my resignation.
this isn't about what the constitution says, Noah.
it's about what's best for this country in a time of crisis.
how in the world do you figure that?
I can't lead effectively with you undermining me at every single opportunity that you may get.
now let's be honest with each other.
that's exactly what you would do if you stayed in place.
Mr. President...I refuse.
good night.
you don't want to walk out that door.
not like this.
otherwise I may have to make this extremely unpleasant for you.
now what are you talking about?
I'm talking about the recording that Tom Lennox has in his possession.
that's what I'm talking about. Conspiracy to commit perjury is a serious offense.
now I have to assume you'd rather resign, than spend the rest of your life living with that kind of humiliation.
so is resorting to blackmail your idea of effective leadership?
if there is anything I've learned anything from you, Noah, it would be that sometimes it's necessary to apply a little brute force.
I don't need your resignation immediately.
let's give the country a chance to take a breath after what happened today.
some time in the next week will be just fine, Mr. Vice president.
nest wants a flight path cleared to Edwards for 20 miles in each direction.
could you get back to me with confirmation?
thank you.
ETA on the helicopter that will transport the bombs is 15 minutes.
you should distribute protocols to the NEST team.
I'm on that.
that's odd.
what?
I think someone's hacked into my system.
are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
ever since what happened to Nadia, I installed a logging program to track any unauthorized access to my hard drive.
you did?
it's telling me that someone accessed my files ten minutes ago, and downloaded the updated schematics to those suitcase nukes.
I'm calling security.
wait! Don't call security. I'm the one who hacked into your system.
why would you do that?
I'll explain it to you in a little while.
explain it to me now.
I did it for Jack.
Audrey Raines is still alive. The Chinese are holding her hostage.
what?
they're going to kill her unless Jack delivers an feedback circuit board from one of the bombs to them.
you've been to all the same briefings.
the Russians have been trying to keep that technology out of Chinese hands for years.
I know.
well, what are the Russians going to say when they find out we just gave it to them?
it's not going to get that far.
how in the world do you know it's not going to get that far?
because Jack gave me his word.
I'm sorry, darling. I can't leave it at that.
Yes, you can.
the bombs that I reprogrammed for Fayed could have killed tens of thousands of people.
but that didn't happen.
I know what it felt like to think that I could've been responsible for each and everyone of their deaths.
I can't be involved with something that could easily end up starting a war.
it's not going to start a war because it's not going to get that far.
besides, this has nothing to do with you. I did it.
Yes, it does.
now that you've told me, it does.
you have to tell Buchanan.
I can't.
then you're forcing me to.
no.
I'm going to do it.
No! Morris! - I'm doing it.
I'll tell him.
reinforcements aren't necessary at this point. The military is guarding the bombs.
there's a CTU swat team standing by.
they'll be en route soon.
all right, thank you.
what is it, Chloe?
Mr. Buchanan...I'm sorry, there's something that you need to know.
you two, come with me.
sir, this area's off-limits.
I'm agent Bauer. I was the man that was responsible for securing these nukes.
I'm under a presidential order to remove the fb-circuit board from one of these bombs, have it transferred back to CTU for immediate analysis.
we don't have much time. This building has been compromised.
now open the gate.
sir, no one is allowed in here.
are you countermanding a presidential order?
how dare you, sergeant?!
now you're wasting my time.
what's your name?
what's your name?!
I want your name, too. Now!
that's not necessary.
open the gate. Open the gate!
I want both of you to stand guard while I remove the circuit board.
come on!
stand down, Jack!
I can't do that.
I won't say it again! - Drop it.
agent Doyle, I am following orders that exceed your security clearance!
he's a rogue agent.
take him out! - I will shoot!
put your weapon down or I will shoot you!
take him! Now!
secure him, he's under arrest.
Doyle, please. Just listen to me.
bill, we've got Jack.
what did he say? - Not much. I had to subdue him.
let me talk to him. - Hold on.
Buchanan wants to talk to you.
Jack, Chloe just told me about Audrey and the Chinese.
I can't let you give them the component. I'm not going to.
I only need to have it long enough for them to let her go.
I was never going to let the Chinese keep it, Bill, I swear to you.
whatever you have planned, Jack, I can't let you do it.
bill, please, right now we're the only chance she's got.
I understand what Audrey means to you.
I promise I will do everything in my power to get her back.
you didn't even know she was alive.
cheng is going to make it impossible for us to ever find her again.
we are her only hope and you know it.
I don't know what to tell you, Jack, except let Doyle bring you back here and we'll work out a game plan.
will you let me make one more call? I'm asking you as a friend.
who do you want to talk to?
president Wayne Palmer.
I'll see if I can reach him.
let me talk to Doyle. - Yeah.
he wants to talk to you.
keep Jack in custody while I try to contact the president.
I'll route the call through your cell. - Yes, sir. I understand.
get him up.
white house sources have confirmed that terrorist leader Abu Fayed is dead.
the president has reportedly recovered from injuries sustained from the failed attempt on his life, and he is expected to make a statement shortly regarding unconfirmed rumors...
yes?
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan has Jack Bauer on the line.
put him through, please.
go ahead. - Please hold for the president.
it's the president.
excuse me.
Mr. President. - Yes, Jack. Congratulations.
is everything still all right? - Yes, sir. The bombs are secure.
but I'm calling because I want you to authorize a field operation.
for what purpose? - To save Audrey Raines.
what? - Mr. President, she's still alive.
the Chinese have been holding her for the past few months.
now they're using her as a bargaining chip.
in exchange for what?
for an fb-sub-circuit board from one of the nukes.
they say they'll release Audrey unharmed if I bring it to them.
it's my understanding, Jack, that component holds the key to Russian defense codes.
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.
I'm sympathetic, I am, and I promise you that I will make available to you the full resources of this country to get Audrey back, but I hope you're not expecting me to authorize this exchange.
not exactly. - Then what exactly?
Mr. President, I need the Chinese to believe that I am willing to go through with this exchange.
I need to have that component on me. They're going to need to see it.
as soon as I know that Audrey is free, I will destroy it.
and how can you guarantee that?
I'm asking you to trust me, Mr. President.
I give you my word that that component will not end up in Chinese hands.
but if it does, the Russians, despite our peace accord, may take action against us for allowing it to happen.
now, under most circumstances, yes, your word would be sufficient, but in this case, Jack, I need to know details.
if I have to, I will destroy that circuit board with a concealed charge of c-4.
an explosion of c-4 would take out anything within 30 feet of it.
you're going to sacrifice yourself? - Yes, sir, if I have to.
Jack... - Mr. President, please.
please, I am begging you.
Audrey raines was willing to give up her life to save mine. I cannot and will not do anything less for her.
you're asking me to sign off on a probable suicide mission.
with all due respect, Mr. President, 16 hours ago, your people were willing to hand me over for dead, and I did not hesitate.
Mr. President, you owe me.
and you're sure this is the only way?
Yes.
all right, then.
I will not fail you, Mr. President.
I'll tell Bill to give you whatever you need.
now I'm going to need confirmation that circuit board has been destroyed after Audrey has been released.
I'll have CTU embeded a tracking device in the board.
you'll have your confirmation.
good luck, Jack. - Thank you, Mr. President.
Yes, sir. - Let me speak with Bill Buchanan.
Yes, sir. I understand.
get over here.
what did he say?
Buchanan said the president signed off on this, and to give you whatever help you need.
I'm going to need someone to help me with Audrey's extraction during the exchange.
I want that to be you.
fine. Where are you going to be?
the name of the Chinese agent that's holding Audrey is Cheng zhi.
he was responsible for my interrogation and torture for almost two years in that chinese prison.
as soon as I get the signal from you that Audrey is safe, two things are going to happen.
I'm going to destroy that circuit board, and Cheng zhi isn't going to make it out of here alive.
so, in answer to your question, where am I going to be?
wherever I have to.
let's go.
are you going to tell me what happened?
the president agreed to Jack's plan.
the prident's going to allow Jack to hand over a defense algorithm to the Chinese?
no. Of course not.
Jack will destroy the component as soon as he knows Audrey's safe. The Chinese will never get it.
and how is he going to manage that?
I don't know. I guess president Palmer trusts him.
telling Buchanan was the right thing to do. You know it was.
it doesn't matter. You should have trusted me.
trusted you?
you're the one that broke into my system.
that's because I didn't think you'd back me up. Obviously, I was right.
so you're going to hold this over my head now, are you?
Yeah. For a long time.
for how long? Could you give me an estimate?
I'll get back to you.
Doyle's on line three.
they're going to lock you on the tracker frequency.
this is Nadia. - It's me. The tracker's on line.
the frequency marker is Alpha-1793.
signal's good. You're on the grid. - Copy. Jack and I are getting ready to move out.
yes? I have the circuit board. Where am I going?
get on the 180 and head north.
get off the first exit after mile marker 49.
I will give you further instructions when you've exited.
I got it.
you have a half an hour.
I don't think I need to remind you what would happen if you are late.
I understand.
CTU has the signal. They're monitoring the device.
I'm set. Let's go.
Jack, you're taking a hell of a risk.
if this goes sour, it could stir a firestorm. And for what?
if you were in my shoes, you wouldn't do the same thing?
I don't mix relationships with my job.
whatever you had with this woman, I hope it's worth it.
this isn't about what I had with a woman.
her name is Audrey Raines.
she served this country with honor. We owe her.
so get in the truck.
come in.
you wanted to see me?
close the door.
the president has just asked me to resign.
what?
and I'm going to comply with his request.
I wanted to tell you personally before you found out from someone else.
I don't understand.
why are you going along with this? Why don't you just tell him that you refuse?
he has a tape of our conversation.
the one where we conspire to commit perjury, and he's threatening to use it against me unless I step down.
Oh, my god.
Tom Lennox recorded it.
bottom line is I'm not being given a choice here.
this is all my fault.
if I hadn't asked you to lie about Karen Hayes, none of this would be happening.
you were just trying to protect me. I could have turned you down, but I didn't.
don't blame yourself.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.
Aw, hell, at least we'll have a lot more time to spend together.
the president said to take a week, but I want this letter of resignation in his hands by the time he finishes his press conference.
I am through being the loyal opposition.
please, sit.
first, I want to say that I'm grateful to report that Abu Fayed, the man responsible for these attacks, has been killed, and that all nuclear devices have been recovered.
I want to take the time to acknowledge the brave men and women in our various law enforcement agencies, and let us not forget our armed services.
all these people have worked so hard to bring this crisis to an end.
their dedication, their perseverance is without equal.
despite the brutality of these attacks, we did not allow the violence born of extremism to push us to extremes.
and, as Americans, we can and should take pride and comfort in that fact.
let me conclude by asking for your prayers tonight for all those who grieve this day. For all those whose lives have been shattered.
let us reach out and begin the process of rebuilding.
let us reach out and begin the process of national healing.
thank you.
I'll take some of your questions now.
Yes. Ian.
Mr. President, how certain are you that the crisis is, in fact, over, and that there are no more of these weapons on American soil?
well, based on the intelligence that I've seen, I can say with full confidence, Ian, that the worst has passed, and that the individuals responsible for these attacks have been apprehended, or else killed.
Yes, Andrea.
Robin, sir.
Robin, yes. Robin.
I'm sorry, it's been a very long day.
please, go ahead.
Mr. President, there are several thousand muslim Americans still being held in detention facilities across the country. What's going to happen to these people?
I've already directed homeland security to begin dismantling these detention facilities.
all detainees are to be released once the immediate crisis is passed.
excuse me.
um, now that the crisis has passed, we will be, um...
we will be reviewing the situation regarding individuals that we have in custody.
I'm sorry. I'm, not, uh, I'm not being very clear.
uh, let me say again regarding your question, Andrea, that...Robin.
I'm sorry. Robin.
let me say again regarding your question that the, uh...
the detention facilities that, that, that we will, uh...
we, we're going t...
Oh, my god. - Get medical right away!
code 4. Repeat, code 4.
we need an emergency medical team to the press room.
get these people out of here.
ladies and gentlemen, we need to clear this room.
please exit by the south door.
all signs indicate the president has suffered a cerebral hemorrhage brought on by injuries he sustained earlier in the day.
meaning he never should have been brought out of the coma.
however detrimental that decision was to his health, I'm confident that in light of his actions today, he would continue to support it.
I'm glad you're so confident, Karen, since it was your reckless action that resulted in his stroke.
sir, it's unclear if the stroke was inevitable, but in any event, I'll take full responsibility.
excuse me.
now is not the time for recriminations, self-imposed or otherwise.
doctor, when will we know the extent of the damage and the prospects for recovery?
after the mri.
the president is being prepped for transport to Bethesda as we speak.
based on my impressions, the damage was severe.
I don't think we can expect the president to regain consciousness anytime soon.
so it is incontestable Wayne Palmer won't be able to continue his duties as commander-in-chief.
there's no denying that this is a great tragedy for the nation and for those of us who know the president personally.
just...take care of him, doctor.
of course.
excuse me.
notify the senate and the house of the transfer of power and have the sec def and the chairman of the joint chiefs authorize me under the 25 amendment.
Yes, sir.
have the press secretary issue a statement.
president Palmer's been incapacitated.
no need for alarm.
executive authority's been transferred to me.
Our...hopes and prayers are with him.
all right, sir.
and I'll also need you available to review everything on the president's agenda.
all right, sir.
actually, there's something on the agenda I think you'll want immediate clarification on.
what's that?
Wayne Palmer just issued a finding allowing Jack Bauer to hand classified russian technology over to the chinese in exchange for the return of a covertly held hostage.
can you explain this?
Yes. That was a personal request from Jack Bauer to the president.
they have a longstanding relationship and as Jack Bauer was largely responsible for recovering the suitcase nukes today, the president wanted to honor his service to this country.
Karen, I asked you to explain it, not excuse it.
understood.
Bauer has guaranteed that the technology will not fall into the hands of the Chinese.
it will only be used to secure the hostage.
incidentally, sir, the hostage in question is Audrey Raines, daughter of James Heller.
even Jack Bauer can't guarantee that outcome.
now, I am happy to honor agent Bauer's service to this country, but not at the risk of giving classified technology to the Chinese and potentially damaging our relationship with russia in the process.
you tell CTU to stop Bauer-- immediately.
sir.
the president expressly that's all for now, Karen.
you, too, tom.
unbelievable.
less than a minute behind his desk and he's already disregarding the president's wishes.
nevertheless, we both share Daniel's unease in handing military secrets over to the Chinese.
I know, Tom, but that is not the point.
no, here's the point.
Daniels is now the acting president, whether we like it or not.
I'm off to the hospital.
I'll see you there.
Buchanan.
Hi, it's me.
how's president Palmer?
not good.
the doctor says that he has a cerebral hemorrhage they don't know the extent of the damage, but obviously he's not able to serve.
Daniels is going to assume the office, and the first wave of his hand, he wants to stop Jack's operation.
Jack has to return to CTU as soon as possible with the component.
does the vice president understand the circumstances under which Wayne Palmer agreed to this?
no. He's not that kind of a man.
he doesn't operate in shades of gray.
does he understand Jack's not gonna give up without a fight?
you just have to get Jack back to CTU as soon as possible, okay?
okay, I'll take care of it.
listen up.
the white house has ordered us to shut down Jack's operation.
how far away are support teams?
six miles.
have them standing by, ready to move in, contact CHP.
have them set up roadblocks.
Chloe, I want you to stand down on this operation.
Why?
you've shown me I can't trust you.
Morris, you cover comm.
Jack's not gonna go along with this.
I know.
Doyle.
Mike, it's Bill.
can Jack hear you? Say yes or no.
Yes.
there's been a change in profile.
Noah Daniels is acting president.
he wants the operation shut down and Jack brought back to CTU immediately.
understood.
what's your current location?
we're about two miles east of the 180 interchange.
okay, I need you to exit at the 70, make the first left.
we'll have roadblocks set up with a backup team ready to take Jack into custody and recover the component.
all right, we'll do that.
you need to disarm Jack as soon as quickly and quietly as possible before he finds out.
no problem.
CTU's got a report from cal trans. The 180's closed due to high winds.
they're concerned about possible fallout.
they want us to take 70 instead.
fine.
don't you move.
Jack, what's the problem?
earlier today, I shot my old partner, a friend of mine, because he tried to stop me from doing what I have to do.
don't think for a second I won't do that to you.
slowly I want you to pull over.
now.
take the keys out of the ignition. Put them on the center console. And your phone.
Jack, you don't want to do this.
slowly get out of the truck. Back up towards the fence.
Jack, listen to me. Daniels is the acting president.
he's the one who called this off.
shut up and grab the fence!
this is gonna end badly, Jack.
you can't go against the white house!
you didn't just betray me. You betrayed your country.
I swear to you I didn't know.
but the russians know about the component.
and they're threatening military action against us if we don't get it back from the chinese.
you're going to go back to your boyfriend and you're going to make him believe that we have the component back.
when you go back to mr. Bishop you will find a way to excuse yourself from the room.
to allow him time to access your pda.
if you can feed all this convincingly to bishop, he will relay it to his russian contact, president suvarov will call off his threat of military action.
I'm always worried the next crisis is around the corner.
I think I know how to take your mind off of it.
head east, 153 meters.
that will put you directly beneath ctu.
this is nadia yassir, code red. It is confirmed, look this place down.
everyone on the floor!
you all right? -Yes, jack. What's going on?
what do they want with josh?
what do you mean josh?
they came here to get him.
I'm not leaving you. -Josh, you're not leaving anyo behind, we're gonna be following you. Just go through here. Go. Keep going.
put your weapon down on the ground. Now!
I'm putting the weapon down.
the boy's escaped. -Get the boy back.
I don't care what you have to do.
Josh, I'm going to give you ten seconds.
if you don't show yourself by the time I finish counting, she dies.
the operation was successful, my men have your grandson.
call me when i can talk to the boy.
have you finished repairing the sub-circut board? -Almost.
I'll return it when you bring me my grandson.
who's in command?
I am. Milo pressman.
I'm acting director of ctu.
the following takes place between 3: 00 am and 4: 00 am.
cheng, I'm sending the boy to you now.
get him into the tunnel, now.
Josh! Josh! Josh. No! Josh.
stop it. What are you gonna do, what do you...
No! -Marilyn. Marilyn!
what do you want with him?
please, let me...they're taking my child. Please!
leave her alone!
he's just a boy. He'S...he's just a boy...
shut up! -Wait! Please!
I can help you calm her down.
please, let me just help you.
get on your feet!
keep her quiet! -Thank you. Thank you.
all of you, listen to me. Pay attention.
we're moving you to a secure room then we will leave.
do what I tell you to do and no one will be hurt.
come on.
we're moving you in two groups. Group one, on your feeT.
what are they doing?
they got what they want.
now they want to stop us from being able to follow them.
we're going to try to get josh back.
Marilyn, I need you to be at the front of our group. Do you understand me?
you need to be in the front of our group.
group two, on your feet!
OK, stand up.
Marilyn, go.
Nadia. If cheng's men lock us in the holding room, we're gonna lose our only chance to get that component back.
so we have to do something now. -Yeah.
but you need to understand, it's a long shot at best...
there's a good chance we won't make it through this.
I understand.
stay close to me.
as soon as I make my move take the first man on the left.
okay. -What are you guys talking about?
Chloe, keep going.
Morris, stay alert.
are you all right? -Yeah.
teams b and c, do we have the hostages secured? -Yes, sir. All secure.
they were cheng's men that attacked us. -They were after my nephew.
I don't know why, but it has to do something with the component, otherwise why would they take the risk?
all I need is a tactical set up and comm and I'm ready to go.
you're still under arrest, jack. -Nadia, please.
I know the schematics of this building better than anyone, I can find them.
okay, I'll release you, jack, but doyle's in command. -Fine.
give him whatever he needs. -yes
how many casualties did you sustain?
one.
are you okay? -No.
I'm set, we need to go.
use my cell until comm's up.
you did great.
move, let's go.
that was really brave.
I need to restore comm and satellite immediately.
there may be more server capacity in data storage.
try it.
keep climb up. Let's go.
Hello, josh. -Who are you?
start loading, we're moving out.
what do you want from me?
what took so long? I've been waiting for your call.
I have the boy with me. -Put him on the phone.
your grandfather wants to speak with you.
my grandfather? -Yes.
take the phone.
grandpa?
Hello, joshua.
look...I'm sorry, i know you've been through a lot.
I'm sorry?
a few hours ago you pointed a gun at my head and said you'd kill me.
I never would have hurt you. -I heard you say it!
I had to make it sound convincing... to you and to jack.
otherwise I wouldn't have gotten away.
but I wouldn't hurt you. Not for anything.
this way.
what do you want from me? -To protect you.
from what?
from your father's mistakes.
if you stay here...
they'll never let you forget what your father did.
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country.
some place we can both start over. -Where?
china.
within a decade, they will have surpassed this country in every possible way.
and we can be part of it, josh.
I am going to give you the future I promised you when you were born.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
no, I didn't think you would.
but you will.
I'll explain everything when I see you.
right now, all i need is for you to keep an open mind.
let's go.
no, wait, please! I don't want to be with my grandpa.
I'm afraid of him. -Your grandfather's a visionary
you should be grateful for the opportunity.
I don't want to be with him, though!
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
cheng's using the boy as a shield-- hold your fire! Hold your fire!
I've got two hostiles at the suv! Cover me now!
go, go, go, go! move!
this is bauer. I've got one hostile down. We're moving towards the roof.
go! Go! Go!
cheng, it's over!
put your weapon down! Now!
put it down!
where is the boy?!
tell me where the boy is, and I won't kill you.
help! - Josh!
help! - Josh...
help -Hold on
Josh...here, you need to grab my arm.
do it now. Now! Now!
you okay? - Yeah.
Mike, it's jack. I'm on the roof.
I lost cheng, but I've got josh.
I need to secure him.
on our way up now.
we're setting up a perimeter around the building.
Josh, the man who had you, his name was cheng.
did he explain why he tried to take you?
no, but he made me talk on the phone with grandpa.
he did?
you talked to your grandfather? - Yeah.
What'd he say?
he said that he loved me, that he wanted to take me to china and that I was his legacy.
I think he's out of his mind.
Josh, listen to me, I need your help.
was there anything that you might have heard that could help us figure out where your grandfather is?
no. - Josh, think.
I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry...
Josh, no. Hey, hey, it's all right.
it's all right.
come on, let's get you back to your mom.
CTU has a team on the way to secure the area.
you need to let them know my father's still involved in this.
your father's involved with the chinese? Why?
I don't know. I'll ask him when I find him.
sir? - Come in, karen.
I just got off the phone with the pentagon, and the latest intel indicates that the russians are moving another two mechanized divisions into the central asian theater.
are they within striki distance of our base? - Yes.
and the troops are at the highest level of alert.
sir, tom lennox was supposed to be on the call with me, and I couldn't find him or get him on the telephone.
is there something that I should know about?
Tom is out in the field running a classified operation.
he figured out who the leak was.
who? - Lisa miller - Lisa miller is spying for the russians? - No.
the man lisa is romantically involved with is.
for the last year, this man, mark bishop's been passing lisa's e-mails along to the russians, along with other things that...
she told him in confidence.
and that's how the russians knew the chinese had the component.
does lisa know? - She does now.
Tom sent her back to this man, bishop, with a cover story and falsified e-mails that we hope will convince the russians that we've destroyed the circuit board before the chinese could get it out of the country, and with any luck, bishop'll forward those e-mails to the russians and they'll back off.
and we'll have bought time to actually retrieve the...
component from the chinese.
well, I hope that works, sir.
Karen. Sit down.
I know you're wondering why you've been kept out of the loop on this, so let me assure you it had nothing to do with you and everything to do with me.
I don'T...I don't understand.
at the same time lisa was...
with bishop, she and I were...
in a relationship as well.
needless to say...
I am ashamed.
Well...sir, I...
I think you're being a little hard on yourself.
you and lisa were both single, and...
there's no way you could know what she was doing behind your back.
it's a question of judgment.
I trusted her.
and unless tom's plan succeeds...
that mistake will bring us to war.
and finally we're done. Here we go.
you okay?
I'm great. That was great.
it felt like you were somewhere else.
I'm just tired.
it's been a long day.
I'll be right back.
do you think he's just concerned or...suspicious?
Yeah, I don't know.
but she is leaving him alone with the pda.
this could be it.
he's making his move, he's making his move.
is that excellent?
that must be the device he's using to forward the e-mails to the russians.
GentlemeN...he is taking the bait.
come on. Come on. There you go.
come on, come on, come on. Send these e-mails. Come on.
he's not going to, sir.
he's putting her pda away.
sweetheart, I'm just gonna pour myself a glass of wine.
you want something? - Sure. I'll have what you're having.
you know, I don't think it's just that you're tired.
what are you talking about?
I can tell from the way you were in bed that something's wrong.
all right, we have a problem here.
I told you everything's fine.
then why can't you look me in the eye?
because you're making me nervous staring at me like that?
can we stop talking about this?
mark... - I know you.
you don't get nervous. - Stop it. You're hurting me.
what's going on?! - Nothing's going on!
you're lying! - I'm not lying!
tell me what's going on!
all right, this is not good.
all right, I'll tell you what's going on.
what's going on you're a lying son of a bitch! - We got to get in there quick! Come on!
I put myself on the line for you and all you were doing was whoring yourself to the russians, stealing my e-mail, you bastard!
bitch!
they're gonna charge me with treason! I'll be put in jail!
who knows about me and the russians?! Who knows?!
Freeze! Get him off her!
put Mr. Bishop in the bedroom.
she's got a pulse. It's faint.
she's breathing.
all right, let's get an ambulance here fast.
Mr. Bishop, I'm tom lennox.
I would guess you've already familiarized yourself with the white house staff.
if I could have a moment alone with the prisoner?
Mr. Bishop, we have incontrovertible evidence you were spying for the russians.
we have recordings of you on the phone with the agent running you, and now, of course, we've got this.
do I have your attention?
all right. So here it is.
you are going to upload the e-mails on Ms. Miller's pda to your russian employers.
additionally, you are going to call your handler and back up the story these e-mails tell namely, that our country destroyed the circuit board before it could fall into chinese hands.
now, if you comply, we'll push for leniency in your sentencing.
if you do not, I can all but guarantee you the death penalty.
what is it, cheng? - I lost the boy.
who has him? - Ctu and your son.
this is totally unacceptable.
the boy was my price for repairing the circuit board.
I lost many men trying to give you your price, Mr. Bauer!
I really don't give a damn about your operational incapacities.
our arrangement is over. - It cannot be over.
you have our component.
you failed to hold up your end of the deal.
the circuit board is no longer yours.
you repair the circuit board and return it to us or there'll be serious consequences!
now you listen to me.
I'm not afraid of you, cheng.
and the next time you threaten me, the consequences will be serious but not for me.
any luck?
Chloe, have our teams been able to locate cheng or the sub-circuit board?
no, nothing yet.
what's the status on our satellite?
we managed to reroute circuits through an undamaged subsystem.
we should have the gd back up in ten minutes.
try to make it five.
Nadia yassir?
Yeah, can I help you?
my name is ben kram, I'm from division.
you should have received a flash memo alerting you of my arrival.
well, our systems are still down so we can't receive memos just yet.
that's exactly why I'm here.
I've been authorized to compile an accounting and assessment of your security breach.
well, sir, we're right in the middle of a recovery operation and it's 3: 00 in the morning.
I mean, this isn't the best time to be questioning my people.
frankly, Ms. Yassir, I don't particularly care what you think.
excuse me?
this incident represents a serious breach in your security protocols, one which resulted in a loss of ctu personnel.
obviously, mistakes were made; errors in judgment.
not the least of which was my accepting bill buchanan's recommendation to leave someone with your limited experience in charge.
so, can I, uh, count on your full cooperation or not?
I never said otherwise.
super.
I'll need a full staff roster and access to all departments plus some kind of a station to set up my investigation.
you can work out of that conference room over there.
thank you.
Yeah, this is nadia yassir.
there is a group from division here in conference room "B."
please give them whatever it is that they need.
Yeah, morris?
this may not be my place, don't let those buggers from division get to you.
you're not responsible for what happened.
of course I'm responsible.
it happened on my watch.
there's nothing you could have done.
do not let them hang you out to dry.
no, morris, people are dead.
Milo is dead because of me.
that's ridiculous.
there's nothing anyone could have done, darling.
no, I...I could have stood up.
I could have said something.
there was no time.
Milo jumped in.
there was time.
I just hesitated.
I was just...
you were just afraid?
Yeah, I have a bit of experience with that.
look, I'm not one to give advice on how to handle self-recrimination, but I know this: Milo was a brave man.
he never would have sacrificed himself if he knew you could allow others to lay his death at your feet.
he'd want you to stay strong, stay in charge.
sir, tom lennox is on the line for you.
Thanks.
Tom, I'm here with karen.
Yes, sir, that information we planted for the russians, that has been sent on to bishop's contact.
good.
do you think it's made its way to suvarov yet?
I'm confident it has, sir.
but I do think a call to the russian president giving him the news ourselves, that might well strengthen the credibility of our story here.
I agree.
Tom, thanks.
uh, sir, there is one other thing.
what's that?
we had some complications, and, uh, lisa was injured in the operation.
how badly?
well, she experienced a loss of oxygen to the brain.
won't know the extent of the damage till she regains consciousness.
she is on her way to the hospital.
how the hell did this happen?
sir, she attacked bishop suddenly before we could even get in there.
he almost strangled her to death.
and what were you doing during all this?
you were supposed to be watching her the whole time!
where was secret service?
sir, we did everything we could.
it just happened too fast.
all right, thank you, tom.
all right, I'll be back there shortly.
I'm so sorry, sir.
I know that despite her betrayal, you still have feelings for lisa.
unfortunately, we do have a pressing matter to address.
Yes, sir, we've got to call him immediately and tell him that the chinese no longer have the component and that it has been destroyed.
set it up in the telepresence suite.
right away, sir.
I'm gonna get you back to your mom soon, okay?
just sit here.
I'll be right back.
CTU - This is jack.
patch me through to marilyn bauer's cell phone. - Yes, sir.
Jack, ground teams have done a thorough search of the area and cheng's vehicles.
the sub circuit board's not here.
what about aerial surveillance?
the choppers have picked up nothing and we just now got satellite back online.
it looks like cheng got out.
there's nothing more we can do here.
get your men ready. We'll go back to ctu. - got it - Hello? - Hey, it's me.
did they tell you josh was safe?
Yeah, but that's all they'll tell me.
what's going on?
when can I see him?
we should be back at ctu in the next few minutes.
Marilyn, the chinese were doing this for my father.
they were trying to get josh to him.
are you sure?
Yeah, josh spoke to him.
what did he tell josh?
he said he wanted to take him back to china, that josh was his legacy.
that's it? That's all he said?
Yeah.
can I talk to him?
of course. Hold on one second.
Hey, it's your mom.
mom. - Hey!
Hey, are you okay?
did they hurt you?
no, I'm all right.
I don't know what i would do if I lost you.
mom, uncle jack, he saved my life.
I know.
I love you so much.
I love you, too, mom.
I'll see you soon, all right?
okay, honey.
you okay?
come on. We need to go.
sir, president suvarov is standing by for you.
whenever you're ready.
let's do this.
president suvarov, you have a secure conference with vice president daniels.
Mr. President, I have some good news to share with you.
and what is this good news, Mr. Vice president?
we were successful in locating and taking out the chinese agents who were attempting to smuggle the fb sub-circuit board out of the country.
are you saying you have the component back in your possession?
no, sir.
the sub-circuit board was destroyed when we attacked the chinese.
I see.
I assume you have proof of this?
Yes, we do.
in addition to fragments from the destroyed component,
I'm prepared to give you whatever images or documentation you need to assure that this threat's been neutralized.
do you mean the same documentation you planted with one of my agents?
excuse me?
the same images you coerced him into sending to my people of a strike that accomplished nothing but destroying an empty building?
Yes, I know you exposed one of my operatives.
I had him under surveillance, which is how I know about your raid on his apartment.
Mr. President...
now, if the chinese agent in possession of the sub-circuit board is allowed to transfer it to his government, the entire russian defense system will be compromised.
I told you I would hold you and your government responsible.
I will not tolerate any threats from you, Mr. President.
we're doing everything in our power to ensure this component does not reach china.
I have already given you ample time to recover it.
now I am feeling less generous.
if you do not deliver complete and irrefutable proof to our embassy that you have recovered or destroyed this component within two hours,
I will have no choice but to extend my country's forward perimeter to compensate for our defensive vulnerabilities.
you are talking about attacking one of our military bases.
now I would urge you to consider the consequences of that.
we have just as many troops in that area and allies who will not look kindly upon any unprovoked aggression on my country.
you and I both know it will not be unprovoked.
this is a matter of survival for us.
it is in both our interests that you get that component back.
you have two hours.
it was all for nothing.
excuse me, sir?
this ruse, it bought us nothing.
we're about to go to war over a piece of circuitry.
this is the agenda for the vice president's briefing with the military.
okay. When did they start?
a few minutes ago.
they're in the oval office.
all right, I'll play catch up.
Tom lennox.
who?
all right, put him through.
the russians are blaming us for allowing the chinese theft of the fb sub-circuit board and they're preparing to retaliate against us.
all our efforts to reacquire the component have failed, so we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
and to make provisions for the escalation of this conflict beyond the central asian theater.
excuse me, Mr. Vice president.
I'm glad you could make it, tom.
general kram is about to run some response scenarios.
before we do that, sir, I need a moment alone with you and karen.
excuse us, ladies and gentlemen.
I've got phillip bauer calling for you on a scrambled line.
what? What does he want?
I don't know.
but he's in league with the chinese.
I think we need to hear him out.
put him on speaker.
Mr. Bauer.
thank you for taking my call, Mr. Vice president.
what's this about?
I think you know what this is about.
tell me anyway so there's no miscommunication.
I want my grandson.
and I want clear passage to the country of my choice.
you give me that, and I'll give you the fb sub-circuit board.
you're working with the chinese?
I was.
they had their chance, they blew it.
how do I know you even have this component?
serial number 3ptl3.
check it against any records you have.
and there it is, sir.
you realize what you're asking?
I'm offering you the opportunity of avoiding a conflict this country does not want, a war this country cannot afford.
not after what's happened today.
I'll send my instructions on an encrypted data stream.
Mr. Bauer...
sir, you're not seriously considering this?
Phillip bauer is a federal fugitive...
complicit in selling nuclear weapons to terrorists.
I know what crimes he's committed.
then how can you even entertain the thought of negotiating with him?
because it may be we can't afford not to.
we are talking about trading the life of an innocent young boy.
we're talking about the lives of a lot more young men if we go to war with russia.
and you think phillip bauer is somebody that we can trust?
the man is a sociopath.
he is a sociopatH.
she's right about that.
but given the stakes, this is a risk worth taking, sir.
none of this makes sense.
everything we know about suvarov tells us the man wouldn't risk military engagement, even for this piece of technology.
unless he's being squeezed.
who by?
his cabinet?
no. The military.
Gredenko was not the only anti-american general left over from the soviet regime.
Yes, some of them are still in power, and suvarov does rely on them.
so you think these generals are just looking for an excuse to pull the trigger.
well, certainly sounds plausible, sir.
well, if that is the case, then we have no choice.
we have to recover that stolen circuit board.
get me ctu.
as soon as we get back to ctu, you and your mother will be transported to a safe location.
how long will we be there?
until we find your grandfather.
uncle jack, when you find him, what are you going to do to him?
Josh, I don't want you worrying about this.
but I promise you, he will never threaten you or your mother again.
agent bauer!
call for you. It's urgent.
Josh, get in the car I'll be right there.
Josh, you need to come with me.
what do you mean?
come now!
uncle jack!
agent doyle!
uncle jack!
agent doyle!
orders jack!
go back to ctu!
the boy stays with me!
get out of my way.
take him dowN.
what are you doing?!
uncle jack!
take him to ctu!
uncle jack!
bill Buchanan had arrested Fayed
and he let him go.
Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland.
someone is going to have to go down-- the lower the rank, the better.
are you asking me to resign? No, Bill.
I have to fire you.
we're talking about the end of my career.
an FB sub-circuit board from one of the weapons is now in the possession of an agent of the Chinese government.
if the Chinese agent in possession of the sub-circuit board is allowed to transfer it to his government, the entire Russian defense system will be compromised.
I will have no choice but to extend my country's forward perimeter.
are you talking about attacking one of our military bases?
you have two hours.
everyone on the floor!
your grandson is in my hands.
have you finished repairing the sub-circuit board?
I'll return it when you bring me my grandson.
chen, I'm sending the boy to you now.
Hello, Josh.
your grandfather wants to speak with you.
what do you want me to do?
I am going to give you the future I promised you when you were born.
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country.
cheng, it's over!
tell me where the boy is and I won't kill you.
help! Josh!
the boy is out of my hands.- In whose hands is that?
in the hands of the CTU and your son.
this is totally unacceptable to me.
the boy was my price for repairing the circuit board.
our arrangement is over.
Phillip Bauer is calling for you on a scrambled line.
I want my grandson, and I want clear passage to the country of my choice.
you give me my grandson and I'll give you the FB sub-circuit board.
are you working with the Chinese?- I was.
do you think Phillip Bauer is somebody that we can trust?
we have no choice.
get me CTU.
Josh, you need to come with me.
what do you mean? - Come now!
agent Doyle! Orders, Jack!
the boy wants to stay with me!
the following takes place between 4am and 5am.
where are you taking me? I thought we were going back to CTU.
I'm sorry, Josh.
you're sorry for what? What's going on? This has to do with my grandpa.
Josh, he's got something we need to stop a war.
so we have to go through the motions of handing you over to him.
What， that is to say you are not ready to really do that?
once we get what we need from him, we're gonna recover you.
we have two Tac teams and LAPD at the rendezvous site.
this is a locating device, Josh.
so we can keep track of you until the rescue is complete.
listen, I understand you're scared.
if it were me, I would be, too.
but I will get you back, Josh.
this may sting a little.
Ryan, we are making a mistake. You can't let them do this.
you can tell Doyle they can't let them bring Josh to my father.
those orders come from the White House. Get in the car.
are you arresting me? Are you charging me with something?
no, Jack. we have orders to place you in temporary custody in order to protect our operation.
don't make us embarrassed.
O'Brian. -Chloe, it's Jack.
Jack, Nadia said you were in custody.
why is CTU handing Josh over to my father?
it's a tradeoff. The order came in from the Vice President.
your father got ahold of the FB sub-circuit board.
he's offering it in exchange for Josh and a safe passage out of the country.
whatever my father said, he has no intention of giving up that circuit board.
the White House feels they have no alternative.
apparently, Doyle has a plan to get Josh back.
my father will have a better plan.
damn it, Chloe, we need to stop this.
put me through to Karen Hayes.
hold on.
my earlier decision was a desperate move on my part, Mr. President.
it was a mistake which I'm sure compromised your trust in me, and for that I'm deeply sorry.
but you are not calling simply to offer your apology，are you？
sir, I'm aware that your generals are pushing you toward a military response, but an opportunity has presented itself that may allow us both to avoid a war that neither of us wants.
I am listening.
the man who has the component is no longer working with the Chinese.
he's offered to trade it back to us, and I've authorized the exchange.
for the sake of both our countries, Mr. Vice President, I hope it happens soon, because until you have the component, I have no choice but to continue on our present path.
according to the information we have obtained from the Chinese military, the situation is not encouraging. You and I know what they are capable of.
I cannot extend or rescind this deadline for anything other than convincing results.
I understand your position, Mr. President.
the purpose of this call is just to keep you know our efforts to try to avoid a conflict.
Karen Hayes. -This is Bauer.
do you know of the Vice President's plan to hand my nephew over to my father?
I do.
Karen, you cannot let this happen.
it is a mistake to trust my father. You will get nothing back.
he's gonna keep Josh，but he won't hand over the circuit board.
but why would he need the circuit board?
because it's his only leverage with the Chinese.
he's useless to them without it.
whatever you're offering them, the Chinese are offering them better terms.
Karen, my father is smart enough to manipulate this exchange.
listen, Jack, I don't think we should go through with this either, but the Vice President feels it's the only way to avoid war.
he's given his order， but I don't have the authority to do anything and the matter must be settled from your side.
I can't.
CTU has put me in temporary custody to stop me from interfering with their operation.
Karen, he is an innocent boy.
you need to stop this， stop it now.
well, that did not go well.
not that I expected to get much good news from Suvarov.
I just got off the phone with Jack Bauer.
wasn't he under arrest？- Yes，he was, but he called me.
well, he called you...
Yes, he's convinced that his father will not hand over the circuit board after getting the boy.
how's he gonna do that? We can verify the authenticity of the board before we hand over Josh.
do you think Jack's concerns are warranted? - Absolutely.
he's Phillip Bauer's son and he's been more right than we have today.
okay, I understand.
all right, let's say we refuse to give up Josh, which is the only thing Phillip Bauer seems to want.
how do we get the circuit board?
well, if you don't have any ideas, I think I have an idea.
wait. If your idea involves keeping Daniels in the dark...
Tom, he won't listen to me, but if you...
my relationship with the Vice President is complicated, and at least he won't drive me away.
but I promise I won't stand in your way if you do.
Hey，Hey! That's personal goods.
there is nothing you need there.
Mr. Buchanan, our subpoena covers everything. I'm sorry.
it's a family photo album, please.
you haven't been charged with any crimes yet, but if you insist，that could change.
the Buchanan residence. Please leave a message.
bill, I know you're there. Please pick up.
listen, I know you don't want to talk to me, but I really need your help.
I don't know where else to turn.
what do you mean, you don't know where else to turn? Are you okay?
no, I'm fine. I just...
I really need your help.
say it.
thank you.
I know that you're angry with me, and I don't blame you.
what do you need from me, Karen?
I just got off the phone with Jack.
Why's he being held in custody by CTU?
because they don't want him to interfere with an ongoing operation.
what operation?
that component is now in the hands of Philip ball.
what?
and he's claiming that he will trade the sub-circuit board for his grandson, but Jack thinks it's a setup.
Phillip will get the boy, keep the component, and make a deal with the Chinese.
I completely agree his view.
have you spoken to Nadia Yassir?
Oh, it's no use telling her. She's under direct orders from the Vice President.
what are you asking me to do, Karen?
whatever it takes to stop the exchange.
Nadia, we just touched down at the meeting point and I'm not seeing any signs of the activity.
satellite surveillance confirms that.
how's the signal on Josh's tracker?
very clear.
tracker's signal's strong.
wait here. I'm gonna check it out.
come on.
CTU've got a call coming in. It could be him.
Morris, can you trace the call?
the signal's scrambled, but we're still patched into Doyle's phone, so we'll be able to listen to both sides of the conversation.
all right, Mike. Go ahead. Answer it.
this is Doyle.
before we do anything, I want CTU to turn off the satellite signals.
what are you talking about?
I have an uplink.
I know when they're watching.
and I know when they're off-line.
stand by.
Nadia, can we tell if he's bluffing?
Yeah. He's not bluffing. He's absolutely in our system.
how?
I don't know.
Mike, we have confirmation that Phillip Bauer has tapped into our satellite surveillance.
can he see Josh's tracker signal?
no. That's on an internal network.
all right. Cut off the satellite links.
tell LAPD and the Tac teams to keep a really wide perimeter outside the satellite area.
please don't let him know.
Morris, shut down the satellite. Marcy, let LAPD and our teams know.
okay.
it's done.
Mike, satellite is off-line.
Mr. Bauer, CTU's satellite is off-line.
I can see that.
now get rid of the chopper.
aerial One, return to base. That's an order.
now, how do you want to work the exchange?
wait there.
when will someone come?
whenever I'm damn well ready.
put my grandson on the phone.
your grandfather wants to speak with you.
but don't fight him, Josh. Okay?
the easier he thinks this is going to go, the less on-guard he's going to be.
Yeah.
Hello, Joshua.
have you given any thought to what we talked about?
Yes.
and I don't want to go anywhere with you. I hate you!
joshua, listen to me.
I understand you're frightened and angry.
but your father's involvement in what happened today will soon be public knowledge.
you can't stay here any more. There's nothing worth remembering here.
my mom's here.
your mother can see you anytime she wants.
but she is incapable of giving you what you need.
where we're going, I will have the capacity and the power to help you become the kind man like your father.
now, you think about that.
the boy is in position, get him back now
no sign of anyone so far.
Yeah. We're still looking for ways to get satellite coverage without Phillip Bauer knowing, but so far, it looks like he's covered all his bases.
Yeah. That doesn't surprise me.
how do I verify the component's real, once they hand it over?
the component has an R-7-2 socket on its underside.
when you plug your PDA into that, I'll be able to verify the circuitry from here.
good.
Nadia, once I know the component's real, if I see a chance to get the kid back, I'm gonna take it.
no, you can't, Mike.
listen, I want to see Josh safe, too, but we're under strict orders from the White House.
we're not authorized to retrieve him until the component's back at CTU.
I'm not talking about what I'm authorized to do.
well, I am.
Mike, there's too much at stake. You're not going off-book on this. Understood?
Mike, do you confirm?
Nadia, Karen Hayes is on the second line.
all right. Put it through to my cell phone.
Mike, I have to take this call. You're on contact with Chloe and Morris.
Yeah. I'll keep them posted in time.
Yes, Ms. Hayes.
Nadia, the Vice President would like to check on the status of the trade with Phillip Bauer.
well, the agent handling the exchange is in position with the boy and he's waiting to be contacted.
I did tell the White House that I would report in as soon as that happened.
Yes, I know, but I just wanted to make sure that everyone's onboard.
that no one, including yourself, has any doubts that this is the right course of action.
the order comes from the Vice President. It's not being questioned.
what's the status of Jack Bauer?
he's currently being transferred to the detention at District.
good. I need to be able to view the operation on your internal deployment grid.
do you mind me asking why? Yes, actually, I do.
the Vice President wants me to keep track of Jack Bauer, so I need the security code now, please.
right away.
log onto the grid on nine-four. Security code Alpha-Charlie-November.
agent bauer unit identifier
got it. Thank you.
I just got a call from Security. You better head over to the lounge.
Why? What's the problem? Marilyn Bauer.
I'm not a prisoner, so stop treating me like one.
I want to see my son, and I want to see him now!
and if you can't tell me where he is, I will find somebody who can!
get out of my way!
get out of my way!
listen, Mrs. Bauer. If you just calm down, we can talk.
did something happen? Did he get hurt? No. Josh is fine.
he's just being held at Division.
they want to debrief him while events are still fresh in his mind.
you have no right to talk to my son if I'm not there.
he needs to have a parent present. I want to be with my son!
I understand what you're going through. No! You have no idea what I'm going through!
and if you don't get me to him right now,I'm going to get our lawyers to take this whole place down, including you!
Morris, I need you to send additional security to the lounge area to escort Mrs. Bauer to holding.
I want my son!
you can't keep me here!
they're on their way. Thanks.
this is Morris O'Brian. Can you have two additional security to the lounge area to escort Marilyn Bauer to Holding, please?
thank you.
what?
it doesn't bother you that we're doing this?
what if we don't get Josh back? Phillip Bauer is a murderer.
I don't like it-- I hate it-- but we have our orders.
when do you care about orders?
we're trying to avoid starting a war.
speaking as someone that placed a lot of people's lives at risk today, I can see why it's necessary.
Jack thinks we're being manipulated.
his father has no intention of giving us the component.
I don't think we can count on Jack being objective about his father right now.
who cares if he's being objective, if he's right?
are you actually angry at me?
as if I'm the one that made the decision to go through with this?
no.i don't mean...
it's just that Josh didn't do anything. He's innocent.
Chloe, keep a close eye on Josh's tracker.
if that signal weakens even a little, I want to know about it immediately.
okay.
CTU, this is Doyle.
you're on with O'Brian.
I've got a helicopter approaching out of the north.
it's too far to read its markings.
you think it might be Phillip Bauer?
I don't know, Morris. That's why I'm asking you.
all right. No need to get testy.
pulling up the FAA database now.
coast Guard has a helicopter patrol just west of your position.
it's not Phillip Bauer.
all right. Thanks.
Doyle? -Yeah?
I know that a lot of people disagree with this operation.
I just want you to know that what you're doing, I think, is absolutely necessary.
Morris, the next time I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
fair enough.
what is this lunatic doing?
don't move.
get your handcuffs out.
do it!
Mr. Buchanan?
what are you doing?
is Jack Bauer with you there?
we have orders to transport him to Detention at District.
I need you to release him to me.
Mr. Buchanan, you've been relieved of duty.
you know me, Turner. I'm no threat to anyone. I'm not even armed.
stay where you are, sir.
you're not going to shoot me, Turner.
sir, you need to stop coming at me.
you know what I'll have to do.
you don't have to do anything.
you're a good man, Turner. I trained you.
I know you don't agree with what I'm doing.
I know you're following orders, but your oath of allegiance is not to one single person.
you swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States.
the orders you're following are illegal.
you have an opportunity here, Turner.
don't blow it.
agent Turner, put the weapon down.
put it down.
do they hand Josh over to my father yet?
not yet. Doyle and the kids are at the trade point.
he's awaiting instructions from your father.
okay.
let's go.
Karen explain everything to you?
Yeah.
thank you for doing this.
you don't have to thank me.
I appreciate it you put yourself in the danger.
let's just hope you're right about your father.
unfortunately, I am right.
thank you.
find out who that is.
I'm so sorry.
I don't believe we've met. I'm Morris O'Brian.
this is Stuart Milo's brother.
Oh, I'm so very sorry.
very sorry.
I have to sign a release for his body.
I'll help you with the paperwork. Come on.
Thanks, Chloe.
he was a good man.
it's Milo's brother, Stuart.
network SIGNAL LOST
Hi, Karen.
I've got Jack. We're on our way.
I just...
I wanted to thank you.
you didn't have to do this.
you made a big sacrifice.
I'm not the only one.
won't be long before they figure out how I was able to locate Jack.
Yeah, well, they already have.
I've just been denied access.
they're probably on their way to arrest me.
listen...
I don't know when they'll let us speak to each other again, so I just want you to know that I'm so sorry.
and I love you very much.
me, too.
they're here.
good luck.
they're about to arrest Karen.
Stuart?
Yeah.
I'm Nadia Yassir, acting head of CTU.
we're in the middle of an operation right now, so I don't have much time.
I just wanted to meet you and tell you how sorry I am.
I know your name. My brother talked about you.
I'd like to know how he died.
your brother died for saving my life.
he saw that I was in danger, and he stood up for me and sacrificed himself.
he was very brave.
no, he wasn't.
not really.
it's more that he was really in love with you.
excuse me， I'll be right back.
Yeah, Chloe, go ahead.
local police found Agents Ryan and Turner handcuffed to their vehicle.
Jack escaped? How?
they were intercepted by Bill Buchanan.
are you sure? - Yes.
why would Bill do something like that?
probably because he agrees with Jack that we shouldn't be trading Josh or trusting his father, regardless of what the orders are.
have Tac teams in the area move into position to intercept them.
they're already doing that.
I'm sorry, I had to...
Mr. Doyle...
what?
listen, please don't do this.
okay, my grandpa's a lunatic.
okay, just please let me go.
your country needs you to do this.
I'll get you back, Josh.
I give you my word.
Doyle, this is Nadia. Do you got it?
go ahead, Nadia.
did you see Philip Ball?
none yet.
Mike, Jack escaped from custody.
we have to assume he's on his way to you to try and stop the exchange.
how does Jack even know where we are?
Karen Hayes told him and gave him your location.
bill Buchanan helped him escape.
damn it.
I've got Tac teams ready to move in.
listen, you know we can't bring more men in.
Phillip Bauer will spot them on satellite and he'll pull out of this.
then you'll have to face him alone.
I'll be fine.
is my uncle coming?
Yeah.
you go out first.
I assume you know why I ordered your detention.
I do.
then you admit to using information you got from CTU to assist Bill Buchanan in breaking Jack Bauer out of custody.
Yes, I do, sir.
you and I have had our own opinions, but we've managed to reach a consensus.
clearly, I was mistaken.
what in the hell were you thinking?
I learned a hard lesson today, sir, when I trusted Fayed.
what lesson was that?
never negotiate with a sociopath.
Phillip Bauer is a sociopath.
we can't trust that he'll give us that component whether we give him the boy or not.
damn it, Karen, that is not your call to make.
I understand that, sir.
I wouldn't have done what I did if I wasn't willing to accept the consequences.
Oh, believe me, there will be consequences.
I will make sure that you and your husband go down hard for this.
you know, it was Tom Lennox who said your different point of view would be an asset to my team, and I believed him.
was he invovled with you?
no, sir.
he didn't know anything about this.
if Jack Bauer prevents this exchange from happening, the Russians will attack our forces in Central Asia.
any blood that is spilled will be on you.
CTU has an incoming call.
this is me.
take Josh and walk toward the water.
we're on our way.
Nadia, did you get that?
Yes. Agent Doyle, be careful.
we need to go, Josh.
tracker shows them moving towards the water.
are you all right? You look a little pale.
I'm fine. I'm just tired.
are you hear that?
Yeah.
Mike, what do you find?
Nadia, we got two men in a small watercraft coming ashore.
we're taking cover.
you stay here, understand?
don't move and stop right there.
send the kid down now.
show me the sub-circuit board first， and I need to verify it.
walk forward.
place it down.
back off.
Mike, report in.
there they are. They've got Josh.
I don't have a clear shot without putting Josh at risk.
get down!
Doyle! We're gonna call for help.
the component was a fake. It was blew.
take it easy, Doyle. Help's on the way.
stay with him, I'm calling CTU，Mr. Bauer.
we got the boy.
give him a full-body scan.
I don't trust CTU.
Yes, sir.
they installed a tracker.
short it out.
it's done.We remove the tracker.
try the backup frequency.
I did， it didn't work.
Morris, get that satellite back up now.
I'm doing it.
this is Bauer. Patch me through to Nadia.
I got Jack Bauer on the line.
put it on speakerphone.
Jack, this is Nadia. Go ahead.
Nadia, I'm at the beach.
the component they delivered to Doyle was a copy.
the case was loaded with explosives.
they detonated it. Doyle's been badly injured.
we need a trauma team here now.
I'm on it. Aerial One.
aerial One, return to the drop-off point.
as we arrived, two of my father's heelers and Josh were headed out to sea in a small boat.
Jack, they just disabled Josh's tracker.
your father forced us to shut down satellite, so it's gonna take us a few minutes to get it back up so we can track them.
how long is it gonna take to get reinforcements?
tac teams are five minutes out.
how bad was agent Doyle's wound?
bad. We need that trauma team.
hurry.
sir...
Melinda said you read the live report regarding CTU's attempt to make the exchange.
they're still trying to track the watercraft Phillip Bauer's heelers used to escape.
they've had no success yet.
Suvarov is expecting my call to confirm that we've retrieved the component.
well, my advice is to give CTU a few more minutes before we call the Russians.
we could still get lucky on this.
Karen was right.
Yes, sir.
she certainly was right.
and I was wrong.
not just about...
Karen was wrong, and so was Wayne palmer.
I'm biased against his administration.
what he faced these past weeks was an impossible situation.
I don't know anymore maybe he was right or not to reach out to Assad.
you know, Tom...
it's easy to think you've got all the answers when none of the ultimate responsibility lies with you, but...
sitting in this chair...
until you sit in this chair, you don't know anything.
you can't know.
sir...
in view of the fact that Karen was right, you might want to reconsider your punitive stance towards her.
my decision may have been wrong, but I can't condone that kind of insubordination.
sir, you do not want the facts of your disagreement with Karen made public.
but that's exactly what will happen if you prosecute her.
after this crisis has passed, Karen Hayes and Bill Buchanan can retire quietly to their country home in Vermont.
you will be honoring for her service.
it's just a better outcome all around.
I'll take your advice under consideration, Tom.
but right now, I need a real- time update on CTU's progress.
all right, sir.
this is Jack.
the trauma team says that Doyle's injuries are life threatening, but he's gonna be blind in one, if not both eyes.
I should've listened to you, Jack.
you did what you thought was right.
is satellite back up yet?
right now.
but it'll be next to impossible to find a craft that size in the dark.
their boat had limited range.
they must be meeting up with a larger vessel.
I want you to get me the names and locations of every offshore oil platform within a ten-mile radius.
what are you thinking?
my father's company, BXJ, has shelter corporations.
they owned oil leases up ande coast.
he didn't pick this location at random.
I'm on it.
all right, Jack, I'll let you know what we find right now. Thanks.
no one follows?
no one.
good.
dock on the northeast side of the platform.
Roger that.
they'll bring the boy here?
Yeah.
when do I get my component?
you get it when they deliver the boy.
good.
you're making the right choice, continuing to work with us.
your mistakes have been totally unacceptable.
but China is still my future.
no MATCHING FILES.
Morris, no luck tracing the oil leases through the CNC servers.
try the EPA database.
coastal leases have to have regulatory approval.
that's a good idea.
Nadia'll have to call in an access code.
Yes. - Nadia...
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, my God, Chloe， Chloe?
Chloe, darling...
are you all right?
can someone please help me?
darling, darling, can you hear me?
can someone please help me?
bill Buchanan had arrested Fayed
and he let him go.
Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland.
someone is going to have to go down-- the lower the rank, the better.
are you asking me to resign? No, Bill.
I have to fire you.
we're talking about the end of my career.
an FB sub-circuit board from one of the weapons is now in the possession of an agent of the Chinese government.
if the Chinese agent in possession of the sub-circuit board is allowed to transfer it to his government, the entire Russian defense system will be compromised.
I will have no choice but to extend my country's forward perimeter.
are you talking about attacking one of our military bases?
you have two hours.
everyone on the floor!
your grandson is in my hands.
have you finished repairing the sub-circuit board?
I'll return it when you bring me my grandson.
chen, I'm sending the boy to you now.
Hello, Josh.
your grandfather wants to speak with you.
what do you want me to do?
I am going to give you the future I promised you when you were born.
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country.
cheng, it's over!
tell me where the boy is and I won't kill you.
help! Josh!
the boy is out of my hands.- In whose hands is that?
in the hands of the CTU and your son.
this is totally unacceptable to me.
the boy was my price for repairing the circuit board.
our arrangement is over.
Phillip Bauer is calling for you on a scrambled line.
I want my grandson, and I want clear passage to the country of my choice.
you give me my grandson and I'll give you the FB sub-circuit board.
are you working with the Chinese?- I was.
do you think Phillip Bauer is somebody that we can trust?
we have no choice.
get me CTU.
Josh, you need to come with me.
what do you mean? - Come now!
agent Doyle! Orders, Jack!
the boy wants to stay with me!
the following takes place between 4am and 5am.
where are you taking me? I thought we were going back to CTU.
I'm sorry, Josh.
you're sorry for what? What's going on? This has to do with my grandpa.
Josh, he's got something we need to stop a war.
so we have to go through the motions of handing you over to him.
What， that is to say you are not ready to really do that?
once we get what we need from him, we're gonna recover you.
we have two Tac teams and LAPD at the rendezvous site.
this is a locating device, Josh.
so we can keep track of you until the rescue is complete.
listen, I understand you're scared.
if it were me, I would be, too.
but I will get you back, Josh.
this may sting a little.
Ryan, we are making a mistake. You can't let them do this.
you can tell Doyle they can't let them bring Josh to my father.
those orders come from the White House. Get in the car.
are you arresting me? Are you charging me with something?
no, Jack. we have orders to place you in temporary custody in order to protect our operation.
don't make us embarrassed.
O'Brian. -Chloe, it's Jack.
Jack, Nadia said you were in custody.
why is CTU handing Josh over to my father?
it's a tradeoff. The order came in from the Vice President.
your father got ahold of the FB sub-circuit board.
he's offering it in exchange for Josh and a safe passage out of the country.
whatever my father said, he has no intention of giving up that circuit board.
the White House feels they have no alternative.
apparently, Doyle has a plan to get Josh back.
my father will have a better plan.
damn it, Chloe, we need to stop this.
put me through to Karen Hayes.
hold on.
my earlier decision was a desperate move on my part, Mr. President.
it was a mistake which I'm sure compromised your trust in me, and for that I'm deeply sorry.
but you are not calling simply to offer your apology，are you？
sir, I'm aware that your generals are pushing you toward a military response, but an opportunity has presented itself that may allow us both to avoid a war that neither of us wants.
I am listening.
the man who has the component is no longer working with the Chinese.
he's offered to trade it back to us, and I've authorized the exchange.
for the sake of both our countries, Mr. Vice President, I hope it happens soon, because until you have the component, I have no choice but to continue on our present path.
according to the information we have obtained from the Chinese military, the situation is not encouraging. You and I know what they are capable of.
I cannot extend or rescind this deadline for anything other than convincing results.
I understand your position, Mr. President.
the purpose of this call is just to keep you know our efforts to try to avoid a conflict.
Karen Hayes. -This is Bauer.
do you know of the Vice President's plan to hand my nephew over to my father?
I do.
Karen, you cannot let this happen.
it is a mistake to trust my father. You will get nothing back.
he's gonna keep Josh，but he won't hand over the circuit board.
but why would he need the circuit board?
because it's his only leverage with the Chinese.
he's useless to them without it.
whatever you're offering them, the Chinese are offering them better terms.
Karen, my father is smart enough to manipulate this exchange.
listen, Jack, I don't think we should go through with this either, but the Vice President feels it's the only way to avoid war.
he's given his order， but I don't have the authority to do anything and the matter must be settled from your side.
I can't.
CTU has put me in temporary custody to stop me from interfering with their operation.
Karen, he is an innocent boy.
you need to stop this， stop it now.
well, that did not go well.
not that I expected to get much good news from Suvarov.
I just got off the phone with Jack Bauer.
wasn't he under arrest？- Yes，he was, but he called me.
well, he called you...
Yes, he's convinced that his father will not hand over the circuit board after getting the boy.
how's he gonna do that? We can verify the authenticity of the board before we hand over Josh.
do you think Jack's concerns are warranted? - Absolutely.
he's Phillip Bauer's son and he's been more right than we have today.
okay, I understand.
all right, let's say we refuse to give up Josh, which is the only thing Phillip Bauer seems to want.
how do we get the circuit board?
well, if you don't have any ideas, I think I have an idea.
wait. If your idea involves keeping Daniels in the dark...
Tom, he won't listen to me, but if you...
my relationship with the Vice President is complicated, and at least he won't drive me away.
but I promise I won't stand in your way if you do.
Hey，Hey! That's personal goods.
there is nothing you need there.
Mr. Buchanan, our subpoena covers everything. I'm sorry.
it's a family photo album, please.
you haven't been charged with any crimes yet, but if you insist，that could change.
the Buchanan residence. Please leave a message.
bill, I know you're there. Please pick up.
listen, I know you don't want to talk to me, but I really need your help.
I don't know where else to turn.
what do you mean, you don't know where else to turn? Are you okay?
no, I'm fine. I just...
I really need your help.
say it.
thank you.
I know that you're angry with me, and I don't blame you.
what do you need from me, Karen?
I just got off the phone with Jack.
Why's he being held in custody by CTU?
because they don't want him to interfere with an ongoing operation.
what operation?
that component is now in the hands of Philip ball.
what?
and he's claiming that he will trade the sub-circuit board for his grandson, but Jack thinks it's a setup.
Phillip will get the boy, keep the component, and make a deal with the Chinese.
I completely agree his view.
have you spoken to Nadia Yassir?
Oh, it's no use telling her. She's under direct orders from the Vice President.
what are you asking me to do, Karen?
whatever it takes to stop the exchange.
Nadia, we just touched down at the meeting point and I'm not seeing any signs of the activity.
satellite surveillance confirms that.
how's the signal on Josh's tracker?
very clear.
tracker's signal's strong.
wait here. I'm gonna check it out.
come on.
CTU've got a call coming in. It could be him.
Morris, can you trace the call?
the signal's scrambled, but we're still patched into Doyle's phone, so we'll be able to listen to both sides of the conversation.
all right, Mike. Go ahead. Answer it.
this is Doyle.
before we do anything, I want CTU to turn off the satellite signals.
what are you talking about?
I have an uplink.
I know when they're watching.
and I know when they're off-line.
stand by.
Nadia, can we tell if he's bluffing?
Yeah. He's not bluffing. He's absolutely in our system.
how?
I don't know.
Mike, we have confirmation that Phillip Bauer has tapped into our satellite surveillance.
can he see Josh's tracker signal?
no. That's on an internal network.
all right. Cut off the satellite links.
tell LAPD and the Tac teams to keep a really wide perimeter outside the satellite area.
please don't let him know.
Morris, shut down the satellite. Marcy, let LAPD and our teams know.
okay.
it's done.
Mike, satellite is off-line.
Mr. Bauer, CTU's satellite is off-line.
I can see that.
now get rid of the chopper.
aerial One, return to base. That's an order.
now, how do you want to work the exchange?
wait there.
when will someone come?
whenever I'm damn well ready.
put my grandson on the phone.
your grandfather wants to speak with you.
but don't fight him, Josh. Okay?
the easier he thinks this is going to go, the less on-guard he's going to be.
Yeah.
Hello, Joshua.
have you given any thought to what we talked about?
Yes.
and I don't want to go anywhere with you. I hate you!
joshua, listen to me.
I understand you're frightened and angry.
but your father's involvement in what happened today will soon be public knowledge.
you can't stay here any more. There's nothing worth remembering here.
my mom's here.
your mother can see you anytime she wants.
but she is incapable of giving you what you need.
where we're going, I will have the capacity and the power to help you become the kind man like your father.
now, you think about that.
the boy is in position, get him back now
no sign of anyone so far.
Yeah. We're still looking for ways to get satellite coverage without Phillip Bauer knowing, but so far, it looks like he's covered all his bases.
Yeah. That doesn't surprise me.
how do I verify the component's real, once they hand it over?
the component has an R-7-2 socket on its underside.
when you plug your PDA into that, I'll be able to verify the circuitry from here.
good.
Nadia, once I know the component's real, if I see a chance to get the kid back, I'm gonna take it.
no, you can't, Mike.
listen, I want to see Josh safe, too, but we're under strict orders from the White House.
we're not authorized to retrieve him until the component's back at CTU.
I'm not talking about what I'm authorized to do.
well, I am.
Mike, there's too much at stake. You're not going off-book on this. Understood?
Mike, do you confirm?
Nadia, Karen Hayes is on the second line.
all right. Put it through to my cell phone.
Mike, I have to take this call. You're on contact with Chloe and Morris.
Yeah. I'll keep them posted in time.
Yes, Ms. Hayes.
Nadia, the Vice President would like to check on the status of the trade with Phillip Bauer.
well, the agent handling the exchange is in position with the boy and he's waiting to be contacted.
I did tell the White House that I would report in as soon as that happened.
Yes, I know, but I just wanted to make sure that everyone's onboard.
that no one, including yourself, has any doubts that this is the right course of action.
the order comes from the Vice President. It's not being questioned.
what's the status of Jack Bauer?
he's currently being transferred to the detention at District.
good. I need to be able to view the operation on your internal deployment grid.
do you mind me asking why? Yes, actually, I do.
the Vice President wants me to keep track of Jack Bauer, so I need the security code now, please.
right away.
log onto the grid on nine-four. Security code Alpha-Charlie-November.
agent bauer unit identifier
got it. Thank you.
I just got a call from Security. You better head over to the lounge.
Why? What's the problem? Marilyn Bauer.
I'm not a prisoner, so stop treating me like one.
I want to see my son, and I want to see him now!
and if you can't tell me where he is, I will find somebody who can!
get out of my way!
get out of my way!
listen, Mrs. Bauer. If you just calm down, we can talk.
did something happen? Did he get hurt? No. Josh is fine.
he's just being held at Division.
they want to debrief him while events are still fresh in his mind.
you have no right to talk to my son if I'm not there.
he needs to have a parent present. I want to be with my son!
I understand what you're going through. No! You have no idea what I'm going through!
and if you don't get me to him right now,I'm going to get our lawyers to take this whole place down, including you!
Morris, I need you to send additional security to the lounge area to escort Mrs. Bauer to holding.
I want my son!
you can't keep me here!
they're on their way. Thanks.
this is Morris O'Brian. Can you have two additional security to the lounge area to escort Marilyn Bauer to Holding, please?
thank you.
what?
it doesn't bother you that we're doing this?
what if we don't get Josh back? Phillip Bauer is a murderer.
I don't like it-- I hate it-- but we have our orders.
when do you care about orders?
we're trying to avoid starting a war.
speaking as someone that placed a lot of people's lives at risk today, I can see why it's necessary.
Jack thinks we're being manipulated.
his father has no intention of giving us the component.
I don't think we can count on Jack being objective about his father right now.
who cares if he's being objective, if he's right?
are you actually angry at me?
as if I'm the one that made the decision to go through with this?
no.i don't mean...
it's just that Josh didn't do anything. He's innocent.
Chloe, keep a close eye on Josh's tracker.
if that signal weakens even a little, I want to know about it immediately.
okay.
CTU, this is Doyle.
you're on with O'Brian.
I've got a helicopter approaching out of the north.
it's too far to read its markings.
you think it might be Phillip Bauer?
I don't know, Morris. That's why I'm asking you.
all right. No need to get testy.
pulling up the FAA database now.
coast Guard has a helicopter patrol just west of your position.
it's not Phillip Bauer.
all right. Thanks.
Doyle? -Yeah?
I know that a lot of people disagree with this operation.
I just want you to know that what you're doing, I think, is absolutely necessary.
Morris, the next time I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
fair enough.
what is this lunatic doing?
don't move.
get your handcuffs out.
do it!
Mr. Buchanan?
what are you doing?
is Jack Bauer with you there?
we have orders to transport him to Detention at District.
I need you to release him to me.
Mr. Buchanan, you've been relieved of duty.
you know me, Turner. I'm no threat to anyone. I'm not even armed.
stay where you are, sir.
you're not going to shoot me, Turner.
sir, you need to stop coming at me.
you know what I'll have to do.
you don't have to do anything.
you're a good man, Turner. I trained you.
I know you don't agree with what I'm doing.
I know you're following orders, but your oath of allegiance is not to one single person.
you swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States.
the orders you're following are illegal.
you have an opportunity here, Turner.
don't blow it.
agent Turner, put the weapon down.
put it down.
do they hand Josh over to my father yet?
not yet. Doyle and the kids are at the trade point.
he's awaiting instructions from your father.
okay.
let's go.
Karen explain everything to you?
Yeah.
thank you for doing this.
you don't have to thank me.
I appreciate it you put yourself in the danger.
let's just hope you're right about your father.
unfortunately, I am right.
thank you.
find out who that is.
I'm so sorry.
I don't believe we've met. I'm Morris O'Brian.
this is Stuart Milo's brother.
Oh, I'm so very sorry.
very sorry.
I have to sign a release for his body.
I'll help you with the paperwork. Come on.
Thanks, Chloe.
he was a good man.
it's Milo's brother, Stuart.
network SIGNAL LOST
Hi, Karen.
I've got Jack. We're on our way.
I just...
I wanted to thank you.
you didn't have to do this.
you made a big sacrifice.
I'm not the only one.
won't be long before they figure out how I was able to locate Jack.
Yeah, well, they already have.
I've just been denied access.
they're probably on their way to arrest me.
listen...
I don't know when they'll let us speak to each other again, so I just want you to know that I'm so sorry.
and I love you very much.
me, too.
they're here.
good luck.
they're about to arrest Karen.
Stuart?
Yeah.
I'm Nadia Yassir, acting head of CTU.
we're in the middle of an operation right now, so I don't have much time.
I just wanted to meet you and tell you how sorry I am.
I know your name. My brother talked about you.
I'd like to know how he died.
your brother died for saving my life.
he saw that I was in danger, and he stood up for me and sacrificed himself.
he was very brave.
no, he wasn't.
not really.
it's more that he was really in love with you.
excuse me， I'll be right back.
Yeah, Chloe, go ahead.
local police found Agents Ryan and Turner handcuffed to their vehicle.
Jack escaped? How?
they were intercepted by Bill Buchanan.
are you sure? - Yes.
why would Bill do something like that?
probably because he agrees with Jack that we shouldn't be trading Josh or trusting his father, regardless of what the orders are.
have Tac teams in the area move into position to intercept them.
they're already doing that.
I'm sorry, I had to...
Mr. Doyle...
what?
listen, please don't do this.
okay, my grandpa's a lunatic.
okay, just please let me go.
your country needs you to do this.
I'll get you back, Josh.
I give you my word.
Doyle, this is Nadia. Do you got it?
go ahead, Nadia.
did you see Philip Ball?
none yet.
Mike, Jack escaped from custody.
we have to assume he's on his way to you to try and stop the exchange.
how does Jack even know where we are?
Karen Hayes told him and gave him your location.
bill Buchanan helped him escape.
damn it.
I've got Tac teams ready to move in.
listen, you know we can't bring more men in.
Phillip Bauer will spot them on satellite and he'll pull out of this.
then you'll have to face him alone.
I'll be fine.
is my uncle coming?
Yeah.
you go out first.
I assume you know why I ordered your detention.
I do.
then you admit to using information you got from CTU to assist Bill Buchanan in breaking Jack Bauer out of custody.
Yes, I do, sir.
you and I have had our own opinions, but we've managed to reach a consensus.
clearly, I was mistaken.
what in the hell were you thinking?
I learned a hard lesson today, sir, when I trusted Fayed.
what lesson was that?
never negotiate with a sociopath.
Phillip Bauer is a sociopath.
we can't trust that he'll give us that component whether we give him the boy or not.
damn it, Karen, that is not your call to make.
I understand that, sir.
I wouldn't have done what I did if I wasn't willing to accept the consequences.
Oh, believe me, there will be consequences.
I will make sure that you and your husband go down hard for this.
you know, it was Tom Lennox who said your different point of view would be an asset to my team, and I believed him.
was he invovled with you?
no, sir.
he didn't know anything about this.
if Jack Bauer prevents this exchange from happening, the Russians will attack our forces in Central Asia.
any blood that is spilled will be on you.
CTU has an incoming call.
this is me.
take Josh and walk toward the water.
we're on our way.
Nadia, did you get that?
Yes. Agent Doyle, be careful.
we need to go, Josh.
tracker shows them moving towards the water.
are you all right? You look a little pale.
I'm fine. I'm just tired.
are you hear that?
Yeah.
Mike, what do you find?
Nadia, we got two men in a small watercraft coming ashore.
we're taking cover.
you stay here, understand?
don't move and stop right there.
send the kid down now.
show me the sub-circuit board first， and I need to verify it.
walk forward.
place it down.
back off.
Mike, report in.
there they are. They've got Josh.
I don't have a clear shot without putting Josh at risk.
get down!
Doyle! We're gonna call for help.
the component was a fake. It was blew.
take it easy, Doyle. Help's on the way.
stay with him, I'm calling CTU，Mr. Bauer.
we got the boy.
give him a full-body scan.
I don't trust CTU.
Yes, sir.
they installed a tracker.
short it out.
it's done.We remove the tracker.
try the backup frequency.
I did， it didn't work.
Morris, get that satellite back up now.
I'm doing it.
this is Bauer. Patch me through to Nadia.
I got Jack Bauer on the line.
put it on speakerphone.
Jack, this is Nadia. Go ahead.
Nadia, I'm at the beach.
the component they delivered to Doyle was a copy.
the case was loaded with explosives.
they detonated it. Doyle's been badly injured.
we need a trauma team here now.
I'm on it. Aerial One.
aerial One, return to the drop-off point.
as we arrived, two of my father's heelers and Josh were headed out to sea in a small boat.
Jack, they just disabled Josh's tracker.
your father forced us to shut down satellite, so it's gonna take us a few minutes to get it back up so we can track them.
how long is it gonna take to get reinforcements?
tac teams are five minutes out.
how bad was agent Doyle's wound?
bad. We need that trauma team.
hurry.
sir...
Melinda said you read the live report regarding CTU's attempt to make the exchange.
they're still trying to track the watercraft Phillip Bauer's heelers used to escape.
they've had no success yet.
Suvarov is expecting my call to confirm that we've retrieved the component.
well, my advice is to give CTU a few more minutes before we call the Russians.
we could still get lucky on this.
Karen was right.
Yes, sir.
she certainly was right.
and I was wrong.
not just about...
Karen was wrong, and so was Wayne palmer.
I'm biased against his administration.
what he faced these past weeks was an impossible situation.
I don't know anymore maybe he was right or not to reach out to Assad.
you know, Tom...
it's easy to think you've got all the answers when none of the ultimate responsibility lies with you, but...
sitting in this chair...
until you sit in this chair, you don't know anything.
you can't know.
sir...
in view of the fact that Karen was right, you might want to reconsider your punitive stance towards her.
my decision may have been wrong, but I can't condone that kind of insubordination.
sir, you do not want the facts of your disagreement with Karen made public.
but that's exactly what will happen if you prosecute her.
after this crisis has passed, Karen Hayes and Bill Buchanan can retire quietly to their country home in Vermont.
you will be honoring for her service.
it's just a better outcome all around.
I'll take your advice under consideration, Tom.
but right now, I need a real- time update on CTU's progress.
all right, sir.
this is Jack.
the trauma team says that Doyle's injuries are life threatening, but he's gonna be blind in one, if not both eyes.
I should've listened to you, Jack.
you did what you thought was right.
is satellite back up yet?
right now.
but it'll be next to impossible to find a craft that size in the dark.
their boat had limited range.
they must be meeting up with a larger vessel.
I want you to get me the names and locations of every offshore oil platform within a ten-mile radius.
what are you thinking?
my father's company, BXJ, has shelter corporations.
they owned oil leases up ande coast.
he didn't pick this location at random.
I'm on it.
all right, Jack, I'll let you know what we find right now. Thanks.
no one follows?
no one.
good.
dock on the northeast side of the platform.
Roger that.
they'll bring the boy here?
Yeah.
when do I get my component?
you get it when they deliver the boy.
good.
you're making the right choice, continuing to work with us.
your mistakes have been totally unacceptable.
but China is still my future.
no MATCHING FILES.
Morris, no luck tracing the oil leases through the CNC servers.
try the EPA database.
coastal leases have to have regulatory approval.
that's a good idea.
Nadia'll have to call in an access code.
Yes. - Nadia...
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, my God, Chloe， Chloe?
Chloe, darling...
are you all right?
can someone please help me?
darling, darling, can you hear me?
can someone please help me?
bill Buchanan had arrested Fayed
and he let him go.
Karen Hayes put it in a blue file over at Homeland.
someone is going to have to go down-- the lower the rank, the better.
are you asking me to resign? No, Bill.
I have to fire you.
we're talking about the end of my career.
an FB sub-circuit board from one of the weapons is now in the possession of an agent of the Chinese government.
if the Chinese agent in possession of the sub-circuit board is allowed to transfer it to his government, the entire Russian defense system will be compromised.
I will have no choice but to extend my country's forward perimeter.
are you talking about attacking one of our military bases?
you have two hours.
everyone on the floor!
your grandson is in my hands.
have you finished repairing the sub-circuit board?
I'll return it when you bring me my grandson.
chen, I'm sending the boy to you now.
Hello, Josh.
your grandfather wants to speak with you.
what do you want me to do?
I am going to give you the future I promised you when you were born.
I'm taking you away from this ungrateful country.
cheng, it's over!
tell me where the boy is and I won't kill you.
help! Josh!
the boy is out of my hands.- In whose hands is that?
in the hands of the CTU and your son.
this is totally unacceptable to me.
the boy was my price for repairing the circuit board.
our arrangement is over.
Phillip Bauer is calling for you on a scrambled line.
I want my grandson, and I want clear passage to the country of my choice.
you give me my grandson and I'll give you the FB sub-circuit board.
are you working with the Chinese?- I was.
do you think Phillip Bauer is somebody that we can trust?
we have no choice.
get me CTU.
Josh, you need to come with me.
what do you mean? - Come now!
agent Doyle! Orders, Jack!
the boy wants to stay with me!
the following takes place between 4am and 5am.
where are you taking me? I thought we were going back to CTU.
I'm sorry, Josh.
you're sorry for what? What's going on? This has to do with my grandpa.
Josh, he's got something we need to stop a war.
so we have to go through the motions of handing you over to him.
What， that is to say you are not ready to really do that?
once we get what we need from him, we're gonna recover you.
we have two Tac teams and LAPD at the rendezvous site.
this is a locating device, Josh.
so we can keep track of you until the rescue is complete.
listen, I understand you're scared.
if it were me, I would be, too.
but I will get you back, Josh.
this may sting a little.
Ryan, we are making a mistake. You can't let them do this.
you can tell Doyle they can't let them bring Josh to my father.
those orders come from the White House. Get in the car.
are you arresting me? Are you charging me with something?
no, Jack. we have orders to place you in temporary custody in order to protect our operation.
don't make us embarrassed.
O'Brian. -Chloe, it's Jack.
Jack, Nadia said you were in custody.
why is CTU handing Josh over to my father?
it's a tradeoff. The order came in from the Vice President.
your father got ahold of the FB sub-circuit board.
he's offering it in exchange for Josh and a safe passage out of the country.
whatever my father said, he has no intention of giving up that circuit board.
the White House feels they have no alternative.
apparently, Doyle has a plan to get Josh back.
my father will have a better plan.
damn it, Chloe, we need to stop this.
put me through to Karen Hayes.
hold on.
my earlier decision was a desperate move on my part, Mr. President.
it was a mistake which I'm sure compromised your trust in me, and for that I'm deeply sorry.
but you are not calling simply to offer your apology，are you？
sir, I'm aware that your generals are pushing you toward a military response, but an opportunity has presented itself that may allow us both to avoid a war that neither of us wants.
I am listening.
the man who has the component is no longer working with the Chinese.
he's offered to trade it back to us, and I've authorized the exchange.
for the sake of both our countries, Mr. Vice President, I hope it happens soon, because until you have the component, I have no choice but to continue on our present path.
according to the information we have obtained from the Chinese military, the situation is not encouraging. You and I know what they are capable of.
I cannot extend or rescind this deadline for anything other than convincing results.
I understand your position, Mr. President.
the purpose of this call is just to keep you know our efforts to try to avoid a conflict.
Karen Hayes. -This is Bauer.
do you know of the Vice President's plan to hand my nephew over to my father?
I do.
Karen, you cannot let this happen.
it is a mistake to trust my father. You will get nothing back.
he's gonna keep Josh，but he won't hand over the circuit board.
but why would he need the circuit board?
because it's his only leverage with the Chinese.
he's useless to them without it.
whatever you're offering them, the Chinese are offering them better terms.
Karen, my father is smart enough to manipulate this exchange.
listen, Jack, I don't think we should go through with this either, but the Vice President feels it's the only way to avoid war.
he's given his order， but I don't have the authority to do anything and the matter must be settled from your side.
I can't.
CTU has put me in temporary custody to stop me from interfering with their operation.
Karen, he is an innocent boy.
you need to stop this， stop it now.
well, that did not go well.
not that I expected to get much good news from Suvarov.
I just got off the phone with Jack Bauer.
wasn't he under arrest？- Yes，he was, but he called me.
well, he called you...
Yes, he's convinced that his father will not hand over the circuit board after getting the boy.
how's he gonna do that? We can verify the authenticity of the board before we hand over Josh.
do you think Jack's concerns are warranted? - Absolutely.
he's Phillip Bauer's son and he's been more right than we have today.
okay, I understand.
all right, let's say we refuse to give up Josh, which is the only thing Phillip Bauer seems to want.
how do we get the circuit board?
well, if you don't have any ideas, I think I have an idea.
wait. If your idea involves keeping Daniels in the dark...
Tom, he won't listen to me, but if you...
my relationship with the Vice President is complicated, and at least he won't drive me away.
but I promise I won't stand in your way if you do.
Hey，Hey! That's personal goods.
there is nothing you need there.
Mr. Buchanan, our subpoena covers everything. I'm sorry.
it's a family photo album, please.
you haven't been charged with any crimes yet, but if you insist，that could change.
the Buchanan residence. Please leave a message.
bill, I know you're there. Please pick up.
listen, I know you don't want to talk to me, but I really need your help.
I don't know where else to turn.
what do you mean, you don't know where else to turn? Are you okay?
no, I'm fine. I just...
I really need your help.
say it.
thank you.
I know that you're angry with me, and I don't blame you.
what do you need from me, Karen?
I just got off the phone with Jack.
Why's he being held in custody by CTU?
because they don't want him to interfere with an ongoing operation.
what operation?
that component is now in the hands of Philip ball.
what?
and he's claiming that he will trade the sub-circuit board for his grandson, but Jack thinks it's a setup.
Phillip will get the boy, keep the component, and make a deal with the Chinese.
I completely agree his view.
have you spoken to Nadia Yassir?
Oh, it's no use telling her. She's under direct orders from the Vice President.
what are you asking me to do, Karen?
whatever it takes to stop the exchange.
Nadia, we just touched down at the meeting point and I'm not seeing any signs of the activity.
satellite surveillance confirms that.
how's the signal on Josh's tracker?
very clear.
tracker's signal's strong.
wait here. I'm gonna check it out.
come on.
CTU've got a call coming in. It could be him.
Morris, can you trace the call?
the signal's scrambled, but we're still patched into Doyle's phone, so we'll be able to listen to both sides of the conversation.
all right, Mike. Go ahead. Answer it.
this is Doyle.
before we do anything, I want CTU to turn off the satellite signals.
what are you talking about?
I have an uplink.
I know when they're watching.
and I know when they're off-line.
stand by.
Nadia, can we tell if he's bluffing?
Yeah. He's not bluffing. He's absolutely in our system.
how?
I don't know.
Mike, we have confirmation that Phillip Bauer has tapped into our satellite surveillance.
can he see Josh's tracker signal?
no. That's on an internal network.
all right. Cut off the satellite links.
tell LAPD and the Tac teams to keep a really wide perimeter outside the satellite area.
please don't let him know.
Morris, shut down the satellite. Marcy, let LAPD and our teams know.
okay.
it's done.
Mike, satellite is off-line.
Mr. Bauer, CTU's satellite is off-line.
I can see that.
now get rid of the chopper.
aerial One, return to base. That's an order.
now, how do you want to work the exchange?
wait there.
when will someone come?
whenever I'm damn well ready.
put my grandson on the phone.
your grandfather wants to speak with you.
but don't fight him, Josh. Okay?
the easier he thinks this is going to go, the less on-guard he's going to be.
Yeah.
Hello, Joshua.
have you given any thought to what we talked about?
Yes.
and I don't want to go anywhere with you. I hate you!
joshua, listen to me.
I understand you're frightened and angry.
but your father's involvement in what happened today will soon be public knowledge.
you can't stay here any more. There's nothing worth remembering here.
my mom's here.
your mother can see you anytime she wants.
but she is incapable of giving you what you need.
where we're going, I will have the capacity and the power to help you become the kind man like your father.
now, you think about that.
the boy is in position, get him back now
no sign of anyone so far.
Yeah. We're still looking for ways to get satellite coverage without Phillip Bauer knowing, but so far, it looks like he's covered all his bases.
Yeah. That doesn't surprise me.
how do I verify the component's real, once they hand it over?
the component has an R-7-2 socket on its underside.
when you plug your PDA into that, I'll be able to verify the circuitry from here.
good.
Nadia, once I know the component's real, if I see a chance to get the kid back, I'm gonna take it.
no, you can't, Mike.
listen, I want to see Josh safe, too, but we're under strict orders from the White House.
we're not authorized to retrieve him until the component's back at CTU.
I'm not talking about what I'm authorized to do.
well, I am.
Mike, there's too much at stake. You're not going off-book on this. Understood?
Mike, do you confirm?
Nadia, Karen Hayes is on the second line.
all right. Put it through to my cell phone.
Mike, I have to take this call. You're on contact with Chloe and Morris.
Yeah. I'll keep them posted in time.
Yes, Ms. Hayes.
Nadia, the Vice President would like to check on the status of the trade with Phillip Bauer.
well, the agent handling the exchange is in position with the boy and he's waiting to be contacted.
I did tell the White House that I would report in as soon as that happened.
Yes, I know, but I just wanted to make sure that everyone's onboard.
that no one, including yourself, has any doubts that this is the right course of action.
the order comes from the Vice President. It's not being questioned.
what's the status of Jack Bauer?
he's currently being transferred to the detention at District.
good. I need to be able to view the operation on your internal deployment grid.
do you mind me asking why? Yes, actually, I do.
the Vice President wants me to keep track of Jack Bauer, so I need the security code now, please.
right away.
log onto the grid on nine-four. Security code Alpha-Charlie-November.
agent bauer unit identifier
got it. Thank you.
I just got a call from Security. You better head over to the lounge.
Why? What's the problem? Marilyn Bauer.
I'm not a prisoner, so stop treating me like one.
I want to see my son, and I want to see him now!
and if you can't tell me where he is, I will find somebody who can!
get out of my way!
get out of my way!
listen, Mrs. Bauer. If you just calm down, we can talk.
did something happen? Did he get hurt? No. Josh is fine.
he's just being held at Division.
they want to debrief him while events are still fresh in his mind.
you have no right to talk to my son if I'm not there.
he needs to have a parent present. I want to be with my son!
I understand what you're going through. No! You have no idea what I'm going through!
and if you don't get me to him right now,I'm going to get our lawyers to take this whole place down, including you!
Morris, I need you to send additional security to the lounge area to escort Mrs. Bauer to holding.
I want my son!
you can't keep me here!
they're on their way. Thanks.
this is Morris O'Brian. Can you have two additional security to the lounge area to escort Marilyn Bauer to Holding, please?
thank you.
what?
it doesn't bother you that we're doing this?
what if we don't get Josh back? Phillip Bauer is a murderer.
I don't like it-- I hate it-- but we have our orders.
when do you care about orders?
we're trying to avoid starting a war.
speaking as someone that placed a lot of people's lives at risk today, I can see why it's necessary.
Jack thinks we're being manipulated.
his father has no intention of giving us the component.
I don't think we can count on Jack being objective about his father right now.
who cares if he's being objective, if he's right?
are you actually angry at me?
as if I'm the one that made the decision to go through with this?
no.i don't mean...
it's just that Josh didn't do anything. He's innocent.
Chloe, keep a close eye on Josh's tracker.
if that signal weakens even a little, I want to know about it immediately.
okay.
CTU, this is Doyle.
you're on with O'Brian.
I've got a helicopter approaching out of the north.
it's too far to read its markings.
you think it might be Phillip Bauer?
I don't know, Morris. That's why I'm asking you.
all right. No need to get testy.
pulling up the FAA database now.
coast Guard has a helicopter patrol just west of your position.
it's not Phillip Bauer.
all right. Thanks.
Doyle? -Yeah?
I know that a lot of people disagree with this operation.
I just want you to know that what you're doing, I think, is absolutely necessary.
Morris, the next time I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
fair enough.
what is this lunatic doing?
don't move.
get your handcuffs out.
do it!
Mr. Buchanan?
what are you doing?
is Jack Bauer with you there?
we have orders to transport him to Detention at District.
I need you to release him to me.
Mr. Buchanan, you've been relieved of duty.
you know me, Turner. I'm no threat to anyone. I'm not even armed.
stay where you are, sir.
you're not going to shoot me, Turner.
sir, you need to stop coming at me.
you know what I'll have to do.
you don't have to do anything.
you're a good man, Turner. I trained you.
I know you don't agree with what I'm doing.
I know you're following orders, but your oath of allegiance is not to one single person.
you swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States.
the orders you're following are illegal.
you have an opportunity here, Turner.
don't blow it.
agent Turner, put the weapon down.
put it down.
do they hand Josh over to my father yet?
not yet. Doyle and the kids are at the trade point.
he's awaiting instructions from your father.
okay.
let's go.
Karen explain everything to you?
Yeah.
thank you for doing this.
you don't have to thank me.
I appreciate it you put yourself in the danger.
let's just hope you're right about your father.
unfortunately, I am right.
thank you.
find out who that is.
I'm so sorry.
I don't believe we've met. I'm Morris O'Brian.
this is Stuart Milo's brother.
Oh, I'm so very sorry.
very sorry.
I have to sign a release for his body.
I'll help you with the paperwork. Come on.
Thanks, Chloe.
he was a good man.
it's Milo's brother, Stuart.
network SIGNAL LOST
Hi, Karen.
I've got Jack. We're on our way.
I just...
I wanted to thank you.
you didn't have to do this.
you made a big sacrifice.
I'm not the only one.
won't be long before they figure out how I was able to locate Jack.
Yeah, well, they already have.
I've just been denied access.
they're probably on their way to arrest me.
listen...
I don't know when they'll let us speak to each other again, so I just want you to know that I'm so sorry.
and I love you very much.
me, too.
they're here.
good luck.
they're about to arrest Karen.
Stuart?
Yeah.
I'm Nadia Yassir, acting head of CTU.
we're in the middle of an operation right now, so I don't have much time.
I just wanted to meet you and tell you how sorry I am.
I know your name. My brother talked about you.
I'd like to know how he died.
your brother died for saving my life.
he saw that I was in danger, and he stood up for me and sacrificed himself.
he was very brave.
no, he wasn't.
not really.
it's more that he was really in love with you.
excuse me， I'll be right back.
Yeah, Chloe, go ahead.
local police found Agents Ryan and Turner handcuffed to their vehicle.
Jack escaped? How?
they were intercepted by Bill Buchanan.
are you sure? - Yes.
why would Bill do something like that?
probably because he agrees with Jack that we shouldn't be trading Josh or trusting his father, regardless of what the orders are.
have Tac teams in the area move into position to intercept them.
they're already doing that.
I'm sorry, I had to...
Mr. Doyle...
what?
listen, please don't do this.
okay, my grandpa's a lunatic.
okay, just please let me go.
your country needs you to do this.
I'll get you back, Josh.
I give you my word.
Doyle, this is Nadia. Do you got it?
go ahead, Nadia.
did you see Philip Ball?
none yet.
Mike, Jack escaped from custody.
we have to assume he's on his way to you to try and stop the exchange.
how does Jack even know where we are?
Karen Hayes told him and gave him your location.
bill Buchanan helped him escape.
damn it.
I've got Tac teams ready to move in.
listen, you know we can't bring more men in.
Phillip Bauer will spot them on satellite and he'll pull out of this.
then you'll have to face him alone.
I'll be fine.
is my uncle coming?
Yeah.
you go out first.
I assume you know why I ordered your detention.
I do.
then you admit to using information you got from CTU to assist Bill Buchanan in breaking Jack Bauer out of custody.
Yes, I do, sir.
you and I have had our own opinions, but we've managed to reach a consensus.
clearly, I was mistaken.
what in the hell were you thinking?
I learned a hard lesson today, sir, when I trusted Fayed.
what lesson was that?
never negotiate with a sociopath.
Phillip Bauer is a sociopath.
we can't trust that he'll give us that component whether we give him the boy or not.
damn it, Karen, that is not your call to make.
I understand that, sir.
I wouldn't have done what I did if I wasn't willing to accept the consequences.
Oh, believe me, there will be consequences.
I will make sure that you and your husband go down hard for this.
you know, it was Tom Lennox who said your different point of view would be an asset to my team, and I believed him.
was he invovled with you?
no, sir.
he didn't know anything about this.
if Jack Bauer prevents this exchange from happening, the Russians will attack our forces in Central Asia.
any blood that is spilled will be on you.
CTU has an incoming call.
this is me.
take Josh and walk toward the water.
we're on our way.
Nadia, did you get that?
Yes. Agent Doyle, be careful.
we need to go, Josh.
tracker shows them moving towards the water.
are you all right? You look a little pale.
I'm fine. I'm just tired.
are you hear that?
Yeah.
Mike, what do you find?
Nadia, we got two men in a small watercraft coming ashore.
we're taking cover.
you stay here, understand?
don't move and stop right there.
send the kid down now.
show me the sub-circuit board first， and I need to verify it.
walk forward.
place it down.
back off.
Mike, report in.
there they are. They've got Josh.
I don't have a clear shot without putting Josh at risk.
get down!
Doyle! We're gonna call for help.
the component was a fake. It was blew.
take it easy, Doyle. Help's on the way.
stay with him, I'm calling CTU，Mr. Bauer.
we got the boy.
give him a full-body scan.
I don't trust CTU.
Yes, sir.
they installed a tracker.
short it out.
it's done.We remove the tracker.
try the backup frequency.
I did， it didn't work.
Morris, get that satellite back up now.
I'm doing it.
this is Bauer. Patch me through to Nadia.
I got Jack Bauer on the line.
put it on speakerphone.
Jack, this is Nadia. Go ahead.
Nadia, I'm at the beach.
the component they delivered to Doyle was a copy.
the case was loaded with explosives.
they detonated it. Doyle's been badly injured.
we need a trauma team here now.
I'm on it. Aerial One.
aerial One, return to the drop-off point.
as we arrived, two of my father's heelers and Josh were headed out to sea in a small boat.
Jack, they just disabled Josh's tracker.
your father forced us to shut down satellite, so it's gonna take us a few minutes to get it back up so we can track them.
how long is it gonna take to get reinforcements?
tac teams are five minutes out.
how bad was agent Doyle's wound?
bad. We need that trauma team.
hurry.
sir...
Melinda said you read the live report regarding CTU's attempt to make the exchange.
they're still trying to track the watercraft Phillip Bauer's heelers used to escape.
they've had no success yet.
Suvarov is expecting my call to confirm that we've retrieved the component.
well, my advice is to give CTU a few more minutes before we call the Russians.
we could still get lucky on this.
Karen was right.
Yes, sir.
she certainly was right.
and I was wrong.
not just about...
Karen was wrong, and so was Wayne palmer.
I'm biased against his administration.
what he faced these past weeks was an impossible situation.
I don't know anymore maybe he was right or not to reach out to Assad.
you know, Tom...
it's easy to think you've got all the answers when none of the ultimate responsibility lies with you, but...
sitting in this chair...
until you sit in this chair, you don't know anything.
you can't know.
sir...
in view of the fact that Karen was right, you might want to reconsider your punitive stance towards her.
my decision may have been wrong, but I can't condone that kind of insubordination.
sir, you do not want the facts of your disagreement with Karen made public.
but that's exactly what will happen if you prosecute her.
after this crisis has passed, Karen Hayes and Bill Buchanan can retire quietly to their country home in Vermont.
you will be honoring for her service.
it's just a better outcome all around.
I'll take your advice under consideration, Tom.
but right now, I need a real- time update on CTU's progress.
all right, sir.
this is Jack.
the trauma team says that Doyle's injuries are life threatening, but he's gonna be blind in one, if not both eyes.
I should've listened to you, Jack.
you did what you thought was right.
is satellite back up yet?
right now.
but it'll be next to impossible to find a craft that size in the dark.
their boat had limited range.
they must be meeting up with a larger vessel.
I want you to get me the names and locations of every offshore oil platform within a ten-mile radius.
what are you thinking?
my father's company, BXJ, has shelter corporations.
they owned oil leases up ande coast.
he didn't pick this location at random.
I'm on it.
all right, Jack, I'll let you know what we find right now. Thanks.
no one follows?
no one.
good.
dock on the northeast side of the platform.
Roger that.
they'll bring the boy here?
Yeah.
when do I get my component?
you get it when they deliver the boy.
good.
you're making the right choice, continuing to work with us.
your mistakes have been totally unacceptable.
but China is still my future.
no MATCHING FILES.
Morris, no luck tracing the oil leases through the CNC servers.
try the EPA database.
coastal leases have to have regulatory approval.
that's a good idea.
Nadia'll have to call in an access code.
Yes. - Nadia...
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Oh, my God, Chloe， Chloe?
Chloe, darling...
are you all right?
can someone please help me?
darling, darling, can you hear me?
can someone please help me?
we're done debating this, Joe.
the UN's been issuing reprimands and economic sanctions while Benjamin Juma has slaughtered over 200, 000 of his own people.
that number will continue to grow if we don't stop him now.
did you find something?
I did. It doesn't confirm how your son died, but it is suspicious.
I'm listening.
his girlfriend, Samantha, received a large lump sum deposit about three days after Roger's suicide.
you mean his alleged suicide.
I'll talk to her myself.
sorry for interrupting, senator. We have a subpoena for Jack Bauer.
he's being questioned by the United States Senate.
we need Mr. Bauer immediately.
the CIP firewall protects every major infrastructure system in this country.
if it were breached they would all be vulnerable.
the department of justice is about to file criminal charges against me.
I'm not exactly in a position to help you.
one of the men behind this threat is someone you know.
you think Tony's looking for justice by attacking this country?
help me find Almeida, and you can ask him yourself.
Where's Tony Almeida?
I'm not talking to you.
this is your call. - Do whatever it takes.
all right! All right! All right! I'll tell you what I know!
last time I saw Almeida...
there's nothing you or the FBI can do about this.
just stay away.
Tony, just talk to me. Tony!
GSA 117, this is northeast three.
go ahead, Air Traffic Control.
advise passing 7, 000.
should be a smoother ride for you down there.
Roger that, Northeast Three.
GSA 117, enter descent for 1, 500.
I've lost comm with GSA 117.
call back FBI.
tell them we have a 767 on approach no longer under our control.
anybody get through to Global Skies 117 yet?
not yet, sir. We're trying everything.
Where's the plane?
120 miles southwest of JFK. Right here.
all right, we have to alert them somehow.
analyze the projected flight path.
figure out if there's any way we can contact them visually from the ground.
Todd, access the passenger records.
get as many cell numbers as you can and try calling them.
Yes, sir.
nothing on the emergency channels?
they're not trying to contact anyone, but they just descended to 1, 500.
I don't know on whose directions.
sir, I think I've got it. - Got what?
listen to this. This was recorded right after we lost comm with them.
GSA 117, this is northeast three.
go ahead, air traffic control.
advise passing 7, 000. Maintain 1, 500.
traffic ahead reporting minor turbulence.
should be a smoother ride for you down there.
they think they're communicating with us.
bureau.
this is Air Traffic Control, Northeast Three.
I need to talk to agent moss. It's urgent.
I'll put you through.
agent moss, I'm transferring air traffic control again.
what's your status, sid?
Larry, the people that broke through the firewall are controlling one of my planes.
they're talking directly to the pilot as if they're air traffic control.
as long as the pilot thinks he's talking to one of us, he'll do whatever they tell him.
my god...
GSA 117, this is Northeast Three Control.
go ahead, Air Traffic Control.
standby for new runway assignment.
turn right, heading zero-six-zero.
intercept radar vectors for runway three-one-left.
northeast Three, we're showing JFK weather systems unchanged.
Yeah, we've had a change in wind direction. Locally, there's danger of wind shear.
Roger that, Northeast Three.
we're turning to heading zero-six-zero now.
all right, they're changing course.
I just got off the phone with Sid Paulson at Northeast Three Air Traffic Control.
Almeida's group is definitely in their system.
Larry... MSA just detected it.
they're trying to locate the point of entry, but they're not optimistic.
forget where they got into the system. How the hell do we get them out?
they don't know. They've never seen anything like this before.
I got the alley.
Larry, go to channel two.
Yeah, go ahead.
I hope you got information from Schector. This thing has escalated.
"Escalated" how?
Almeida's group has picked out a 767 in flight. They're controlling it.
what? Why, to what end?
I don't know, but we've got to find this guy.
what did Schector say?
not much before he was killed. - What?
sniper across the street. We sealed off the building immediately; we know he's in there.
are you okay? - Yeah, it was surgical.
I'm sending you swat teams to search the building.
thank you. Swat teams are on their way.
I think you got a problem.
Almeida called that office seconds after Schector was killed.
how do you think he knew I was there?
I'm assuming he had him under watch.
I think it came from your office. - What?
someone from inside the FBI had to tip him off.
they were the only people who knew I was going with you.
no, I can't believe that.
Yeah, and I didn't want to believe Tony Almeida was a terrorist, but at some point we have to deal with the facts, not what we want to believe is true.
look, jack, I read your file.
I know you have a propensity for not trusting people, but my team has been working around the clock to find Almeida;
they are all good agents.
explain to me how they got a sniper on the roof that quickly.
I told you, Almeida had schector staked out.
we were in Schector's office for ten minutes.
there is no way they got a shooter in position that fast.
now, until you know where the leak is, you have to assume that you've got a bad agent, and you need to work around him.
no offense, Jack, but I brought you here to help with Schector, not to co-manage this operation.
you brought me here to help you find Almeida.
and I am warning you, you better be careful who you let in.
Mr. Bauer, I need you to surrender the gun.
agent Kilner... Jack Bauer, put him in your vehicle till I get back.
Yes, ma'am. This way, sir.
what's your status?
we secured the building; all exits are covered.
when swat team gets here, we'll have video feed and we'll sweep the building room by room.
if the shooter's in there, we'll find him. - He's in there.
Janis, whatever you've got on FAA, leave it with to Sean. Come here.
wait a minute. I need her here. - So do I.
there was sniper fire at Schector's office. We've got three dead bodies.
where Renee was? - Yeah.
is she okay? - She's fine. Listen, I need you to provide support.
Renee thinks she has the sniper locked in the columbia building.
there are swat teams on the way; coordinate with them. - Okay.
anything else from NSA on how we get through to that plane?
no, but we talked to one of the men who worked with latham, who said that based on the way the firewall was breached, he doesn't think we can contact.
yeah? - Yeah, it's agent Moss.
Hey, got any help for us?
NSA's nowhere. What about you?
we're trying to contact passengers.
so far we haven't been able to get through tanyone.
what about air force?
they've scrambled an F-16 to intercept, but it's still about 13 minutes out.
look, let me get back to you. - Yeah.
Gus, have you been able to break into their channel yet?
no, but I can hear Almeida talking with the pilot.
he's landing him on runway three-one-left.
it can't be that simple.
these people didn't take control of this plane just so they can land it on a different runway.
Todd, what do you got on your radar that's on approach?
everything looks good.
and GSA 117?
nothing near it.
what the hell is this?
what happened?
all the screens for the eastern quadrant are locked.
try the backup systems.
they're not working.
Todd! It's locked! - Mine, too.
okay, they're blind.
all right... send their sunrise flight into an intersecting landing pattern with 117.
SRI35, this is Northeast Three Control.
we have a new runway assignment for you.
set your vectors for final: Runway four-right.
Roger that, Northeast Three.
he's changing course.
Paulson. - How do your screens look over there?
who is this? - That doesn't matter.
what matters is that I took out your control units.
call the bureau. Trace this call.
what the hell do you want? - Want you to see what we can do.
why don't you pull up the surveillance cameras at JFK tower.
give me the cameras at JFK.
Sid, there's another plane landing on four-right.
it crosses three-one-left.
Oh, my god, they're on a collision course.
scramble emergency at JFK.
GSA 117, pull up. Safety alert, pull up.
traffic on runway four-right. - Pull up.
sir, we have screens and communication back.
we're good.
Yeah.
that was just a warning shot.
whatever we do next will not be a demonstration.
it'll be the real thing.
what do you people want?
you'll find out soon enough.
it's Emerson.
Emerson's here.
get the module ready.
uncuff him.
what happened to those planes?
don't worry about that.
did you crash them?
how many people did you kill?
get him cleaned up.
Hey, Tony.
I take it everything went as planned.
Yeah. The off-site testing the module worked perfectly.
let's see it good.
that's our genius, huh?
Yes, it is.
had to be encouraged?
Yeah, but...I've got him to a place where he'll do whatever you want.
can I talk to you a second?
take the module.
so, tell me how the FBI managed to find schector.
they used an old colleague of mine.
an agent I worked with at ctu named Jack Bauer.
I know who Bauer is.
Yeah, well, he's not going to be a problem.
I took care of schector before he could tell the FBI anything.
I'll take care of jack bauer, too.
I don't want you distracted from this new job.
speaking of which, you haven't told me what that is.
Tanner has the specs.
he'll brief you when he gets here.
why don't you just tell me now?
cause you don't need to know yet.
Tony, we've been doing this three years.
the less information any one of us has, the safer we all are.
come on, after this next job, we're done.
cash in our chips, do whatever we want.
all right.
I'll call you when Tanner gets here.
okay.
let's go.
come on, let's go.
I'm about to make a statement, sir.
are there any changes I should know about?
no, this is fine.
just remember, don't indicate when the go-ahead to invade will be given, no matter how hard they push.
but it's acceptable to mention that the president is meeting with former prime minister Matobo?
Yes.
and when they ask whether the president sees him as Juma's successor?
no need to hide that fact.
president wants maximum ensure on her support for Matobo.
thank you, sir.
good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
despite global condemnation and un-imposed economic sanctions, general Benjamin Juma has refused to stop the genocide that his brutal dictatorship has been perpetrating since he took power.
president Taylor has made a persuasive case to the world that a full-scale military intervention by us forces and a complete overthrow of the Juma regime would be the only way to stop the continued slaughter of the innocent men, women and children of Sangala.
Yes, you there.
Angela, has the president formulated a timeframe for this intervention?
hello.
JFK?
how long ago did this happen?
I can tell you that president Taylor and former prime minister Ule Matobo are meeting as we speak to formulate a post-invasion strategy.
I know how hard you fought to get the support needed to launch this military operation.
and I want you to know my country will be eternally grateful.
our soldiers are the ones truly deserving of your gratitude.
they're the people putting their lives on the line.
still, I know you are taking a great political risk.
I have no reservations.
stopping Juma is the right thing to do.
but once he's been removed from power, it is critical that he be dealt with in a court of law.
and not in a way that would perpetuate the cycle of violence.
Juma has killed over 200, 000 of our people, including two of my own brothers.
so no one knows more about the "cycle of violence" than I do.
but my countrymen will want to see Juma punished.
then punish him according to the rule of law.
that's the only way democracy will work in sangala.
if no one is treated outside the law.
not even juma.
you have my word.
and now, I'd like for us to go over some last-minute operational points with my secretary of defense.
all right.
excuse me, Mr. Matobo.
what's the emergency, Ethan?
northeast Air Traffic Control just reported a near-miss between two commercial flights at JFK.
fortunately, no one was hurt.
and we think this man Almeida was behind it?
it's him.
we verified his voice print.
he contacted Air Traffic Control and told them this was a demonstration;
a shot across the bow, so to speak.
what does he want?
his exact words were: "You'll find out soon enough.
Oh, this is unacceptable.
I mean, it's just technology.
we should be able to unplug these bastards.
well, we're trying everything we can think of, but it's not that simple.
what's being done to find almeida?
the FBI believes they're closing in on one of his associates.
what's their timeframe?
that's unclear.
let's go ahead with grounding all nonessential air traffic, and set up a meeting with homeland, FBI, and DOD.
Yes, madam president.
Yeah.
who is it?
hold on.
Tanner.
Hey, Tanner, what's going on?
I'm trapped in the columbia building.
FBI's sweeping it right now, floor by floor.
I don't know how the hell I'll be able to get past them.
I understand. Exactly where in the building are you?
the basement.
near the west stairwell.
we're on 12th.
Roger that, alpha.
sixth floor's clear. We're moving.
Charlie two, moving to the fifth floor.
proceed.
Mr. Bauer?
yeah?
I just wanted to tell you
what they're making you go through at that senate hearing, it's wrong.
no, it's not.
it's better that everything comes out in the open.
we've done so many secret things over the years in the name of protecting this country we've created two worlds:
ours and the people we promised to protect.
they deserve to know the truth.
then they can decide how far they want to let us go.
still, you don't deserve to be treated that way, not after what you've done for our country.
and I'm not the only one who thinks so.
thank you.
entering the basement from the west stairwell.
Roger that, agent Lennert.
I'm here to get you out.
Tony sent me.
how?
put this on.
a swat unit just cleared the stairwell.
take it up to the lobby.
there's a gray Ford parked next to the kiosk in the lot behind the building.
go.
this is lennert.
basement level is clear.
Roger that.
alpha team is clearing the first floor. You can hook up with them.
on my way.
agent Walker, she's good, huh?
Yes, sir.
she understands what it takes to get the job done.
you mind if I step out and get some air?
it's been a hell of a morning.
Yeah, sure thing.
just stay close, sir.
Yeah. Thanks.
just got an update from headquarters.
your friend, Tony Almeida, just used the device to orchestrate a nearness between two planes.
he's threatening to do it for real next time.
are all your men represented on the deployment grid?
Yeah. Why?
I don't want you to do anything now, but see that man walking away?
that's your shooter.
how can that be possible?
if one of your people helped him get through the perimeter. Check the grid.
look out.
you're right. He's not one of ours.
we'll follow him, see if he leads us back to Almeida Dornan.
no, that's not the right move.
you can't bring anyone else into this, not until you know how badly the bureau's been compromised.
okay, so what are you suggesting?
we can do this on our own.
Yes, agent Walker?
ma'am?
put more agents on the eastern edge of the building. The perimeter looks light.
on it.
you made the right call. - We'll see.
I need your vehicle.
we have some breaking news to tell you about right now.
the FAA confirms a near-miss between two planes at JFK international airport just a short time ago.
as a result, outgoing flights nationwide are now grounded.
planes already in the air will be grounded once they land.
the FAA...
listen to me, Latham.
do as you're told, you'll stay alive.
you understand?
put him in storage. Watch him.
an effective demonstration, wouldn't you say, mr. Dubaku?
very effective.
general Juma will be pleased.
is that the module? As promised.
and I've brought the man who constructed it here in case there are any modifications necessary.
well, now that we've impressed upon the white house what we can do, mr. Dubaku, perhaps now would be a good time to make your demands known to president Taylor.
make the preparations.
your government killed my other and they tried to kill me.
now they are going to pay a very steep price for interfering in our affairs.
FAA is landing flights, so far without incident, but these people have proven what they can do, and at any time, can sabotage air traffic or any of the infrastructure systems we have beyond the firewall.
does NSA have a timeframe on fixing it so we can keep these people out permanently?
Madame president, the CIP firewall was the result of a multi-year project.
reengineering the code could take weeks or months.
at this point, NSA just doesn't know.
exactly what systems are vulnerable, Dr. Cornell?
at the top of the list would be the national power grid.
if disabled, we could end up being unable to deliver power to many millions of people.
a blackout of that scale would almost certainly result in rioting in the major cities.
even more critical are the water treatment and distribution systems.
by sabotaging key dams and sewage processing plants, they could contaminate drinking water on a massive scale.
deaths from poisoning would be substantial up front and massive casualties would follow soon thereafter as people began to die from dehydration.
is there any way to protect these systems?
the only way would be shutting them down, and then, within a short time, it would be impossible to supply the population with sufficient food and clean water.
the resulting civil unrest would undoubtedly aggravate the situation.
here are the latest projections.
thank you.
Mr. Kanin, this is agent Gedge.
I'm with the first gentleman.
with him where? What's he doing?
Mr. Taylor is on his way to confront Roger's former girlfriend.
I thought he gave up on all of this.
sir, he's consumed by the idea that his son was murdered, and for the past two months, he's been pursuing that belief through a private detective he hired without the president's knowledge.
my god.
why is this the first time I'm hearing anything about this?
I take full responsibility for that, sir.
Mr. Taylor enlisted me in keeping his activities off the official manifest, but, uh, it's gotten out of hand.
and at this point, I'm worried about mr. Taylor'S...
state of mind.
I think the president needs to know what's going on.
all right.
thank you, agent Gedge.
agent Gedge?
sir? - Everything all right?
Yes, sir. Just checking in.
building disaster preparedness scenarios is not enough.
I want the governors to put the national guard on a pre-deployment footing.
and until we find and stop the people behind this,
I think we should talk about raising the alert level.
Yes, sir, we have the building locked down, and we're searching for the suspect as we speak.
it's our higst priority, sir.
understood, sir.
the white house is all over this. Homeland's leaning on us.
we have got to find this guy now.
Dornan's team is almost done with their first sweep through the building, but he said it's his gut feeling that the sniper is not in there.
I don't care about his gut feeling.
Renee said they had that building locked down right after the shots were fired.
he's got to be in there. - Yes, sir.
tell them to search every square inch.
what?
Dornan also wants to know if we know where agent Walker is.
she's not at the scene?
she left ten minutes ago without logging her destination.
what about Bauer?
he left the scene with her.
he's coming up on heavy traffic. You can drop back a little more.
it's all right. I've got him.
it's larry. - Don't answer it.
then he'll get worried or suspicious.
Dornan said you left the scene.
Why? What's going on?
SWAT has the operation well in hand. I'm following up on a lead.
what lead?
a weapon we found at Schector's. There's a partial serial number.
I want to run it past a source.
with Bauer? - Uh, yes, he's accompanying me.
what the hell's going on?
what are you talking about?
getting our hands on that shooter is our best chance of finding Almeida and finding that device.
and I don't think you'd turn your back on that operation for a lead you could easily have passed off to another agent.
I'm not sure what you're getting at. - Neither am I.
has Bauer gotten you involved with something?
Larry, do you trust me?
you know the answer to that.
then please just accept what I'm telling you.
we're following up on a lead, and I will fill you in if and when we find something.
all right.
damn it.
I do not like this.
I just flat out lied to my boss. - Did he buy it?
are we in the clear?
Yeah, I think so.
good. Thanks.
is Renee's comm unit active?
Yeah. Her walkie's on.
can you do a triangulation on it?
well, that's not really what the system is set up for.
but I can try.
do more than try. I want to know where she is.
can you not just call her? - Janis...
just do it. - Okay.
back at schector's office, when I told you to get almeida's locatio out of him, how far were you planning to go with that?
you told me to do whatever it takes.
Yeah, I said that for Schector's benefit, to scare him, but you were actually planning to do it.
how far would you have gone?
it doesn't matter now.
it does to me.
I just put my career on the line because of you, and I'd like to know who I'm dealing with.
Yeah, well, you read my file.
your file doesn't tell me how you justify the things that you've done.
you know, I've been answering a lot of questions lately about my past and, frankly, I'm done.
I told you I'd help you find Tony Almeida.
I even agreed to do it your way.
since the FBI's been compromised, that's no longer an option.
now, I can still help you find him, but you're going to have to let me do it my way.
is that going to be a problem?
we'll see.
I know you think this is a mistake.
it's not my place to say that, sir.
and if it was?
the authorities have already questioned your son's girlfriend, sir.
not about this.
they assumed my son killed himself and didn't look deeply enough into anything.
this way, sir.
well, even though the market's been soft, you don't want to hedge your buy on this.
it's really all I can do today.
you know 10, 000 shares isn't going to cut it.
excuse me a moment.
miss Roth, there is a secret service agent here to see you.
what?
he's at reception.
would you like me to have someone show him to your desk?
no.
um, I'll be right there.
all right.
let me call you back.
ma'am.
Mr. Taylor?
this is quite a surprise.
how are you?
I wanted to have a word with you, Sam, in private.
of course.
I'm-I'm really sorry we haven't spoken since Roger's funeral.
it's just...it's been so difficult for me.
I know about the money, sam.
excuse me?
$400, 000 wired to an offshore account in the Cayman islands three days after you found my son's body.
there's no point in denying it.
I just want to know who paid you and why.
paid me? -You know something about my son's death, and somebody's paid you to keep quiet about it.
Mr. Taylor, that is just not true.
please, just answer the question!
the money...
it...
it isn't mine. -What do you mean, it's not yours?
it belongs to my aunt.
she's had financial difficulties since my uncle passed away last year.
it's from his divested real estate holdings.
I suggested she move it to an offshore account to hide it from the IRS,
you want me to believe you had the presence of mind to commit tax fraud three days after my son died, the man you supposedly loved?
I did love him.
and I'm telling you the truth.
you have to believe me.
I don't.
you're lying.
well, if that's what you think then we have nothing left to talk about...
you're not going anywhere till I get the truth.
let go of me.
sir!
you know who murdered my son.
no one murdered him.
he killed himself.
Mr. Taylor, we need to go.
right now.
I'm going to find out what you're hiding, and when I do, god help you.
I'm out.
copy that.
emerson spoke to his man inside the bureau.
he says you're clear.
good.
look, I need to prep my men on the next job so why don't you tell me what we need.
I'll give you the specs when I get there.
where are you?
I'm just pulling in right now.
we'll be standing by.
when Tanner gets here, we'll take off.
why don't you start the deletion program while we pack up?
damn it. We can't go any farther. He'll make us. Hold on.
agent walker, we need to go!
here. You're going to need this.
thank you.
I'll engage him. Cover my flank.
I can handle it.
okay, let's go. Now.
put the weapon down.
now!
is Tony Almeida on the boat?
is Tony Almeida on the boat?
I don't know.
Jack! It doesn't matter.
Almeida's not the priority.
the device is.
we have to go in now.
surveillance camera went out.
go check it out.
cover me.
deletion Complete damn it!
stop!
damn it.
the device is gone.
the locator files have been deleted.
where is it?
okay.
what happened to you?
what the hell happened to you?
Tanner. Emerson spoke to his man inside the bureau.
he says you're clear. - Good.
look, I need to prep my men on the next job, so why don't you tell me what we need.
I'll give you the specs when I get there.
I'll engage him. Cover my flank.
I can handle it.
I don't understand. Almeida was orchestrating these attacks.
if he doesn't have the CIP device, who does?
Almeida's working for the Juma regime.
this is colonel Ike Dubaku.
we demand an immediate withdraw of the U. S.Naval strike force by this time tomorrow...
the American troops are still in position near our country.
president Taylor just received your demands.
the perhaps it is time for a more forceful demonstration.
I know about Samantha Roth.
she's hiding something about my son's murder.
Roger wasn't murdered.
I wasn't completely honest with you.
what do you mean?
Roger didn't commit suicide, Mr. Taylor.
he was murdered.
Jack, Tony is not a terrorist.
he's working with me.
we're working outside the government.
that's why we have to get Tony back undercover.
Bauer, you're going to make it out of here.
shut up.
get down!
we got to get you out of here and back undercover.
go!
Tony, let's go!
the following takes place between 11a.m. and 12p.m. security saw Bauer and Almeida getting into a dark-colored panel van.
what direction were they heading? - West.
what's happening with the D. O. T. Cameras?
I've been trying. Traffic images aren't loading.
what do you mean not loading?
just what I said. The server's not responding.
the hacker must be jamming the transmission.
how the hell can they do that?
well, if I knew, I'd be able to get around it.
continue checking ancillary security cams, ATMs, parking garages-- there has to be something.
well, keep canvassing the area.
someone else may have seen the vehicle. That...
fine. Let me know.
no luck on municipal cameras.
looks like they have someone running interference for them.
damn it.
Bauer must have worked out this escape with Almeida's people.
I'm so sorry, Larry.
that son of a bitch played me. Had me believing the bureau was compromised
someone on the inside working against us.
I realize now it was him all along.
don't put this on yourself. He played us both.
no, I should have seen it.
this is fine, take it downstairs.
Bauer's facing a federal indictment-- years in prison.
Almeida must have offered him a way out.
agent Moss... the White House is on line one.
I'll, uh, take it in the conference room. Thanks, Erica.
I'm going to make this rig, Larry.
whatever it takes, I will find Bauer and Almeida.
well, throw in a CIP device, and maybe we'll be off the hook.
Janis, what's the status of that shooter?
he hasn't regained consciousness yet.
but a print match is just coming up now.
his name is Alan Tanner.
he was former special forces, discharged after desert storm.
discharged why?
medical reasons.
he made claims to having Gulf War Syndrome.
tried to sue the government, case was dismissed.
I want to be informed the minute he's awake.
I'm connecting you now.
agent Moss, this is Ethan Kanin.
I'm here with the president.
what are you and your folks doing about the situation?
we put out an all-agency alert.
everyone understands apprehending Almeida is our top priority.
how did he escape?
he had the help of a former CTU agent that we mistakenly trusted.
a man by the name of Jack Bauer.
I thought he was in the middle of a senate investigative hearing.
Yes, sir, that is correct.
we issued a subpoena a few hours ago, excusing him from the hearings in order to enlist his help in apprehending Almeida.
now you're saying that these two men are allied?
it would appear so.
my God...
you and your people have royally screwed up, agent Moss!
without Almeida, we have no way of finding Dubaku and no chance of recovering the CIP device.
Ethan, let's stay on point.
agent Moss, are you working any other leads?
Yes, Madame President.
a confederate of Almeida's who was wounded earlier today.
he's just out of surgery.
we're waiting for him to regain consciousness.
do we have a time frame from the hospital on when that might happen?
no, ma'am. Not really.
let me be clear, recapturing Almeida and Bauer isn't just your top priority, it's your only priority.
Yes, ma'am.
keep us posted, agent.
bottom line: The bureau is not going to be the answer to our prayers here.
I'm afraid not.
how much time does that leave us?
less than two hours.
Dubaku's demand is that our forces retreat behind the 23rd meridian within 24 hours.
now, in order to meet that timetable, the fleet and carrier air wing must start withdrawing by 1: 00, at the latest.
which would effectively end our mission in Africa and condemn another 100, 000 Sangalans to a certain and brutal death.
on the other hand, if you authorize the invasion, Dubaku will undoubtedly engage the CIP device.
how far has the FAA gotten with grounding aircraft?
still over a thousand planes in the air across the country waiting for clearance to land.
Dubaku could bring down any one of them at any moment.
or... use the device for something far worse.
I ran for office on the principle of non-negotiation with terrorists.
how can I abandon that now, the very first time I'm tested?
and, if I do so, won't I be telling Dubaku, and the rest of the world, that blackmailing America works?
Madame President, those are questions for the future.
we have a decision to make now.
what do you call this place?
we like to think of it as CTU.
what's left of it, anyway.
it's good to see you.
it's good to see you, too.
I'm glad you're with us.
I'm not with anyone until someone starts answering some questions.
might as well start with you.
why the hell are you not dead?
I was dead, Jack.
for almost ten minutes.
or so I was told.
by who? - By him.
his name's David Emerson.
I don't know who he paid off at CTU, but it was his people who injected my body with a hypothermic compound, and was able to revive me.
who is he and what does he want?
independent contractor.
enlists ex-military and intelligence operatives, jobs them out to clients.
apparently, I fit the profile.
what profile?
former employees with grievances against the federal government.
emerson had been keeping tabs on me ever since I left CTU.
after Michelle was killed...
he figured I'd make a good recruit.
and everyone else thinking you're dead, so much the better.
Yeah.
and since then, you've been working undercover to expose his operation?
no, Jack. - What?
I was really working for him.
I was angry.
I hated the federal government for what it took from me.
I ran Emerson's crew for more than three years.
and I did some pretty bad things.
what made you turn against him?
the CIP device.
emerson had my crew stealing components to breach the firewall.
I knew what that meant: Innocent Americans would die.
and I didn't signed up for that.
damn it, Tony! Why didn't you call the authorities?
he couldn't, Jack. - Why not?
he found out Emerson's client was Dubaku.
that's who you believe has agents inside the government.
the Juma regime controls Sangala's vast diamond wealth.
Dubaku hasn't been shy about throwing it around.
how widespread is the corruption?
pervasive. That's why Tony came to me.
he didn't know how far or high up this thing went.
Dubaku is the key to this thing, Jack.
if we're going to uncover the conspiracy, we have to get to him before he leaves the U. S.
that's why I have to get back under soon as possible.
there's a new job in the pipeline for me and my crew
I don't have all the details, but I do know that it'll get me in the same room with Dubkau himself.
the challenge is going to be reinstalling Tony with Emerson.
we have to assume Emerson knew Tony was in FBI custody and somehow managed to escape.
Emerson's going to think Tony made a deal with the U. S. Attorney.
that's right.
I can help you with this.
Yes, you can.
outside of the three of you, who else is involved in this operatn?
it's just us. This is it.
please, at least tell me that you've got some proof that this conspiracy exists.
Yes, we do. But only at the lowest level.
at this point, we've just begun to scratch the surface.
okay.
I'll work with you.
but only because, right now, you are the only people that I trust.
you give me one reason to question that, and I swear I will turn you in.
you understand?
all right. Chloe, set up the call with Emerson.
I found two freelancers who might work. Angers.
you trust them? - Yeah. I've worked with them before. They're close.
Litvak knows them, too. - Okay.
they may want to know more about the job before they sign on.
only thing they need to know is what it pays.
all right.
yeah? - It's me.
where are you?
I'm at a parking garage, getting a car.
I got away from the FBI.
Yeah, I heard.
I also heard it was Jack Bauer who broke you out.
that's right.
that doesn't make any sense, Tony.
Bauer's working for them. He helped capture you.
it's only because he didn't have a choice.
he's on board now.
what do you mean "on board"?
you heard about the senate hearings this morning?
they're going to file criminal charges against him.
I told Bauer that if he helped us out with the mission, you could get him out of the country.
look, David, if it weren't for Jack, I'd still be in custody.
we can use him, I'm telling you.
I don't know, Tony.
Morgan's hiring new men now.
Morgan's a thug.
he can't run point on something this important.
let me do it like we planned.
Bauer can take Tanner's place and we're good to go.
all right, bring Bauer. We're at 2211 Chesterfield.
right off Nolan. - Got it.
he buy it?
we'll see.
Mr. Taylor, I understand you were looking for me.
Yes, agent Gedge, I have to go out and I'm going to need some transpoation.
certainly. Where will we be going?
I'll direct you on the way.
I need a destination for the manifest, sir.
as before, I'd like you to keep this off the manifest.
and no driver this time, just you and me.
I thought we were through with all the subterfuge, Mr. Taylor.
please just do as I ask.
I'm sorry, sir, not without an explanation.
it's Samantha Roth.
she says she has new information regarding my son's death.
Mr. Taylor...
I thought I was done with this, too, believe me.
I didn't initiate this. She called me.
I know you felt obligated to report my prior activities- And rightly so
but I would still like to think that I can count on your loyalty when I ask for it.
I could lose my job, sir.
this will be the last time. I promise.
please.
I'll call you as soon as I secure a vehicle. - Thank you.
who was that?
staff, nothing.
here, can you help me with this? - Sure.
it was a gift from my father. You remember?
on the day I won back his seat in the Nate.
prime Minister Matobo has asked to see me.
he's going to want to know why I haven't authorized the invasion yet.
what are you going to tell him?
I don't know.
the American people elected you because they trust your judgment, Allison, and they're going to trust you to make the right call on this, too.
I don't know what the right call is.
the right call is whatever you decide it is.
how many units in the field?
17-- all availab agents are deployed.
widen the grid-- we have to assume Bauer and Almeida have gotten outside of our perimeter by now.
on it.
Sean Hillinger.
Sean, its me.
Christina. Where are you?
I'm calling from the plane.
you haven't landed yet?
no, the pilot says we're in a holding pattern...
but we just keep circling and circling, and I can see other planes out the window, too
eight or nine, at least.
Christina, sweetheart, relax.
but the woman sitting next to me says she heard something about a near miss and a problem with the air traffic control system.
Sean, do you know anything about this?
Yeah, it's true.
the FAA has grounded some planes, but it's only a precaution.
Really? - Yeah, it was an isolated incident. You're going to be fine.
okay. I just...
I got worried there for a minute. You know how I am.
I do. Now, listen, I want you to call me as soon as you land.
I will.
I love you.
I love you, too.
was that your wife?
Janis told me her plane's still in the air.
you okay?
okay, there's a maniac out there with the capability of bringing down planes at will, so, no, Erika, I'm not okay.
her flight is number 18 in the queue, so it'll be another two hours, at least, before hers gets clearance.
I'm sorry.
is there anything I can do?
no.
no, there's nothing anybody can do; that's the problem.
Yeah, she's right here. I'll let her know. Thank you, bye-bye.
I just got off the phone with the hospital.
Tanner's regained consciousness.
is he well enough to talk?
he's well enough to ask the doctor to make a phone call for him.
who did he call? - Gage Whitney Pace, which is a law firm, I think.
the second largest in DC.
go grab your laptop, Janis. You're coming with me.
I am?
Why?
because we have to get to Tanner before his lawyers do and because if I can get Almeida's location out of him,
I want you on-site to vet the intelligence to our field teams.
go. - Okay.
tell me about Emerson.
he's British, former SAS.
urban warfare, sniping, close-quarter combat.
saw action in Beirut and Mogadishu.
so he's good.
extremely.
but he's not some wack job or ideologue.
he's about two things-- money and personal loyalty.
sounds like you still admire him.
listen, Jack, he treated me like a brother when I thought I had nobody else.
is this going to be a problem?
no.
I know he's on the wrong side of this.
I'll do what has to be done.
we're here.
Where's Emerson? - Inside. Come in.
good to see you.
take Mr. Bauer downstairs. I need to talk to Tony.
what's going on?
bringing in Bauer is not worth the risk.
what are you talking about?
have a seat.
emerson will be right with you.
I'd still be in FBI custody if it wasn't for him.
Tony, you already made your case.
we can use him.
I considered it...
but I'm going a different way.
I owe him, David. You understand that?
Yeah, and I appreciate your sense of loyalty.
I always have, but this is business, Tony.
you can't have a...
an unknown factor like Jack Bauer coming in and messing things up.
so, what, you're going to kill him?
no, you are.
they're going to kill him.
he'll get out of it. - What if he can't?
then Jack's death solidifies Tony's position in the crew.
Tony was in FBI custody.
if he'd gone back in there by himself, the suspicion would have rested on him alone.
so by deflecting it onto Jack...
we keep Tony's cover viable.
you knew this might happen the whole time.
Yes.
so did Jack.
put your weapon down!
put your weapon down or I will kill him!
I came here to do a job, not be double-crossed by you.
U're already shorthanded. You need good men, not like these two traffic cops.
look what I've done to them.
I am here because I've got nowhere else to go.
Tony said if I helped you, you could get me out of the country.
look, if you don't believe me, pull the trigger.
what, are you crazy?
kill him!
no.
kill him or I'm out of here.
fine.
keep it.
so you're requesting a priority landing for flight 112 out of Las Vegas?
this is not a request. I'm forwarding an urgent protocol from the White House.
and your name was...
Larry Moss, special agent in charge.
this is a matter of national security.
agent Moss, may I have your level five access number?
thank you, sir.
flight 112 is moved to the head of the queue and should be on the ground shortly.
thank you.
president Taylor, this is colonel Ike Dubaku.
as you have no doubt confirmed, the near-collision at JFKIAT international was no accident.
we have the CIP device.
we have the capability to kill tens of thousands of American and we are prepared to do so.
I wanted you to hear it for yourself, Prime Minister, so that you would understand my dilemma.
I see.
you are recalling the invasion force.
well, that determination has yet to be made.
and this device over which Dubaku has control, it poses a significant risk to your people?
Yes.
it's a technology that has the potential for mass civilian casualties.
and it puts the infrastructure of my country in grave jeopardy.
what of Sangala?
believe me, no one is more aware of what's at stake than I.
so you've been informed of the situation in Kasga Province?
Juma's troops are advancing on a refugee camp.
over 2, 000 lives are threatened.
mostly women and children.
there is also the matter of those soldiers who have, on the promise of American support, deserted the regime and joined my freedom fighters on the ground.
at least...
provide us the weapons we need in order to defend ourselves.
you've been patient with us before, Mr. Matobo.
I can only ask that you be patient again.
no please, if you'll excuse me.
Madame President, I implore you, do not abandon my country.
Mr. Matobo, I will do everything that I can.
I count on you.
thank you.
you didn't think that I would want to know about the refugees in Kasanga?
Madame President, you have enough to think about without being burdened with details.
especially details that might push me toward proceeding with the invasion.
ma'am, you have to start focusing on alternates to the invasion.
give me a good alternative and I'll consider it.
I'm not saying it's a good alternative, but it's the only one.
comply with Dubaku's demands.
stand down the task force.
that's your recommendation?
back down? - It is.
damn it, Ethan, you heard Matobo.
he's has fighters on the ground counting on us.
do you want me to be responsible for another bay of pigs?
kennedy survived the bay of pigs, and you'll survive this.
a superpower has to act first and foremost in its own best interests.
always? - Always.
no apologies.
what about allowing a third party to dictate its foreign policy
does a superpower do that? - Yes, if there's no other option.
and right now, there's not.
what have we heard from the FBI about the search for Almeida and Bauer?
nothing, ma'am.
check with them anyway.
no hard feelings, Jack?
forget it.
have to be careful in our profession. I'm sure you understand.
Yeah. - We all know the drill.
disagreements are fine, but when a decision's made, fall in or you're gone.
I've heard a lot of guys say that.
good to know you mean it.
before you were subpoenaed, you traveled the world, place to place, more than a year.
Why?
what were you looking for?
it doesn't really matter.
whatever it was, I didn't find it.
you must have known what was waiting.
why'd you come back?
wanted to know what it was like to walk into a propeller.
that's funny.
but no, really.
Why?
this is my home.
that doesn't explain in to the justice department.
Tony said you were in Beirut and Mogadishu.
and Afghanistan.
two tours. Went back a third time as a private contractor.
be polite, professional, and have a plan to kill everyone you meet, right?
pretty much.
that's the question, isn't it?
where do the rules of engagement end and the crimes begin?
you want to know why I came back?
that's why.
I'm not sure I follow.
I just got tired of talking to myself.
you see, I actually believe everything I did was right.
so I wanted to start a dialogue.
come clean, set the record straight.
first mistake.
so I found out.
no one who hasn't been to the edge and looked over can ever understand.
Yeah.
it's good to have you on board, Jack.
yeah?
what was that about?
he's just trying to get a handle on me.
watch yourself around him, Jack.
and do not underestimate him.
I won't.
all right, listen up.
I just got the call. We're a go.
a go for what? We don't even know what the hell the job is.
picking up a package, delivering it to our client.
here's the location.
a residence at 167 Foxhall Road.
it belongs to the state department. Memorize the layout.
we don't know the exact spot of the pickup yet, but probably the master suite.
the package is a person.
Yes, it is.
former prime minister Matobo of Sangala.
the assignment is to grab him and deliver him to colonel Dubaku.
the colonel wants to ask him some questions, and as you can imagine, the colonel can be quite persuasive.
now, Matobo has tight security, so finish arming up, be prepared to engage.
we roll in two minutes.
they're going to kidnap Matobo. We have to alert somebody and stop this.
no, we do nothing.
but you heard them-- they're going to torture him and probably kill him.
unfortunately, yes.
Matobo single-handedly led the fight against genocide in his country.
he doesn't deserve this. - I understand that, Chloe.
but if we don't go along with the grab, Jack and Tony will not find colonel Dubaku, and we will not get to the bottom of this conspiracy.
Agreed?
agreed.
I don't want you to wait for me.
sir?
just drive away. I'll call you when I need you.
you know I can't do that, Mr. Taylor.
we're already off the manifest, Brian.
she won't talk to me unless I'm alone.
all right, I'll take up a position on the bridge.
she'll never know I'm there.
all right.
Mr. Taylor.
I can't stay long.
what you told me on the phone, is it true?
Yes, they killed Roger and made it look like a suicide.
who? Who did this?
the same people who provided false documents to the SEC to show he'd been trading on inside information.
who are they?
I don't know who they are.
they just said that they would kill me if I said anything.
easy, easy, Sam.
easy.
I loved him.
I know you did, Sam.
but right now, I really need to know what happened.
Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers in his department.
that's how it started.
when was this?
january.
uh, early January.
the compliance officer at his firm asked him to flag any undisclosed ownership in securities positions.
I don't understand.
basically, kickbacks.
but what he found was something else.
two of his portfolio managers had taken on a new client.
the Bahamas branch of Switzerland's oldest bank: Bank Lausanne International.
what was wrong with that?
bank Lausanne's records revealed that it was actively trading with firms doing business in Sangala.
it jumped out at Roger, too, for obvious reasons, and digging deeper, he uncovered other blind accounts that were copying the bank's trades.
which accounts?
accounts that were traced to a senior member of your wife's administration.
who?
I don't know.
but whoever it was had a vested interest in the proposed military action.
somebody who was betting against her, who didn't think she'd be able to pull it off politically?
betting heavily in 10, 000-share blocks.
Roger was a day or two away from presenting her with the evidence.
it's all here.
account numbers, trading records, everything that he knew.
I'm sorry that I can't help you out more.
I've given you all I can.
do what you have to do, but leave me out of it.
please?
okay.
thank you.
is Tanner in there?
his condition is still listed as critical.
are his lawyers here yet?
no.
but they will be any minute.
okay, get to the lobby and keep an eye out for them.
call me as soon as they enter the hospital.
got it.
come on.
Hello, Mr. Tanner.
I'm agent Walker. This is agent Gold.
we're with the FBI.
I think you remember me.
I know you're in pain, so I'll make this brief.
tell me where Tony Almeida is.
does Almeida have another base of operations?
is that where the CIP device is?
my lawyers cannot help you, Mr. Tanner.
you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison if you don't cooperate.
but if you do, I give you my word, I will personally vouch for you.
helping me find the device can go a long way towards reducing your sentence.
I'm sorry. Is something funny?
they'd never let that happen.
who is they?
Colonel Dubaku? Is that who Tony Almeida takes his orders from?
do you work for him too?
go away.
open your eyes, Mr. Tanner.
I said open your eyes.
look at me!
is Dubaku here in this country?
does he have the device?
Renee, Renee...please.
I don't know what you're doing.
what are you doing?
Walker. -Tanner's lawyers just arrived.
all right, thanks.
his legal team is here.
I need you to stall them.
me? How am I supposed to do at?
I don't care. Make something up.
just keep them out of this room as long as you can.
I'm not comfortable with this.
comfortable with what?
we are breaking about 50 federal guidelines just by being here.
listen to me, Janis.
this man is our only lead.
that man asked for legal counsel.
I heard him.
thousands of lives are at stake here.
we either bend the rules a little bit right now or we lose this chance forever.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just...I can't.
look, Tony Almeida and Jack Bauer escaped custody on my watch.
I have to make this right.
you either help me or you don't.
okay.
you're out of time, Mr. Tanner.
tell me what you know.
you can do what you want to me.
I'm not going to tell you a damn thing.
who do you work for?
you can't do this...
where is Almeida?
how do I find the CIP device? Tell me now.
my lawyers...
you can't do this.
you're FBI.
this is illegal.
I have rights.
I suggest you use your last breath wisely.
go to hell.
I assure you, I'm taking this very seriously.
then tell us where our client is.
as I said, he was moved for security reasons.
into the annex?
Yes, sir.
then why isn't he there?
listen, if I can just get on the phone, I'll call my office.
we'll get to the bottom of this...
we've had enough of your help, agent Gold.
I...
I'm genuinely confused too.
excuse me.
we're trying to find our client, Mr. Alan Tanner.
just a minute.
I've got a ventilator malfunction.
damn it! He's coding!
get a team and a crash cart over here!
code blue: Room 421, Tanner.
it's blocked or something.
we have to get in there! -I'm trying to!
it won't push. -Open this door!
this is an emergency!
I can't get the door open.
it's jammed!
is somebody in there with him?
he's all yours, counselor.
wait a minute.
we need to talk to you!
you don't want to know, Janis.
don't ask.
have agent Alves drive you back to the office.
Hillinger. -Let me speak to Larry.
sir, I've got Walker on the line.
did you get anything?
I may have a lead on Aeida.
apparently, there's a plot in place against the former prime minister Sangala.
Tanner says Almeida's crew has a plan to abduct him.
when? -Pretty much now.
listen, Larry, if Almeida's still a part of this and we can get there before him, we can set a trap.
all right.
I'll alert the prime minister's security detail and scramble a TAC team.
Matobo's housed in a state department residence:
167 Foxhall Road.
I'm on my way.
Renee, do not go in alone.
wait for backup.
right.
is this major Etolo?
it is.
this is special agent Larry Moss, FBI.
this is not a drill.
code: Alpha Alpha Delta.
lock the prime minister down.
I repeat, lock him down.
Yes, sir.
we're clear. Go.
Where's Matobo?
I don't know...
where is he?
where is he?
I got him!
drop the weapon! Now!
put the gun down!
on your knees!
where is Matobo?
you will not be able to get to him now.
what is happening, Ule?
who is doing this to us?
stay calm.
it's going to be all right.
it's dead.
what you got? -It's a safe room; reinforced concrete.
why the hell didn't we know about this?
you have three seconds to open the door.
one... I can't.
two...
it can't be unlocked from the outside.
it can only be opened from the inside.
Jack, if we leave here without Matobo, we lose our only chance of getting at Dubaku.
that was Bob Cornell at NSA.
they've detected another firewall breach.
there's been another attack?
not yet, but they believe the CIP device is being utilized.
we have to assume Dubaku is initiating another attack.
madam president.
what is it, Tim?
I've just been forwarded a scrambled call.
it's from Colonel Dubaku, he's demanding to speak with you.
the deadline for your forces to begin their withdrawal has passed.
go to the window. See what you have done.
comply with my demands within the hour, or 10, 000 more Americans will die.
she's on her way up.
I'll call you when it's done.
Mr. Taylor, are you okay?
audio forensics cleaned up the recording.
Walker is extraneous.
kill her before you get here.
Larry, I don't think it's worth it. There's nothing here.
all right. Fine, help Janis coordinate with NSA.
I'm sorry about Renee. She was a good agent.
we don't know that she's dead yet!
I've devoted my life to the bureau and you just expect me to believe that the entire government's been corrupted.
not all of them.
but until we find out who, we can't trust anyone.
and the four of you really think you can stop this?
we have to. It's as simple as that.
Dubaku wants you and your wife. That's the deal.
you're asking us to risk our lives to be delivered into Dubaku's hands.
listen to him, Ule.
but how can we trust this man?
because he has no reason to lie.
how are you doing, Tony?
all right. Where's Emerson?
he's dead.
you want Matobo or not?
you got what you came for.
now, get the hell out of here.
did everything go smoothly?
we have the Matobos, that's what matters.
I heard about the planes on the radio.
the White House still has not complied.
what do you intend to do?
exactly what we promised.
we're ready, sir.
Where's the target located?
Kidron, Ohio.
population?
begin.
we think this is the truck the Matobos were abducted in.
where was this image taken?
near Northwoods Airfield.
were you able to track it?
not beyond this sector. But they were heading east on Mckinley Avenue.
all right. Make sure the vehicle I. D. is disseminated to all search teams and local agencies.
Yes, sir.
Larry, I think I found something. - Yeah?
I've been working NSA, trying to back-trace the CIP attack that took down the two planes.
and I found a code fragment which I think could be residue from the CIP intrusion.
I'm running a pattern match right now.
with any luck at all, we may be able to anticipate where in the infrastructure they're targeting next.
and I need Sean.
Janis, I don't want to waste personnel on some wild-goose chase.
Dubaku's threatened to kill 10, 000 more Americans in the next 30 minutes.
I understand that, and I will drop it the minute it feels cold.
all right, I'm going to brief the White House. Keep me in the loop.
are you sure he's up to running this operation?
Larry's fine. - Is he?
you're the one who told me about him and Renee.
this has got to be hitting him pretty hard.
if I don't think Larry can do his job, I'll let you know, all right?
in the meantime, I need you to open up a fresh socket.
you've reached agent Brian Gedge.
please leave a message and I'll get back to you.
agent Gedge, I expected to hear from you by now.
it's urgent that I speak with the first gentleman as soon as possible.
call me back, Agent Gedge.
this is extremely important.
yes?
Larry Moss with the FBI.
where are we, Larry?
we've I. D. a vehicle that we believe was used in the Matobos' abduction.
we're still trying to track it down.
and how long is that going to take?
I wish I could tell you, sir. I don't have a time frame.
that's not good enough, Larry.
unless you get some results, we're going to get hit again.
a lot of people are going to die if you don't find Dubaku.
with all respect, sir, I don't need to be told what's at stake.
we're giving everything we can.
one of our agents has given her life.
Yes, I was told about that. I'm... I'm sorry.
I'll call you the minute we have something. - We'll be waiting.
God...
the Matobos have been taken into a building.
546 Adams.
okay, pull up the stats on that address. - On it.
it's the Ritter Building, four stories high.
the building is two years old.
give me the security specs. - Give me a minute.
we're coming up on it.
I'm going to need your help.
I see you've chosen a target.
the Boyd Chemical Plant near Kidron, Ohio.
the CIP device has enabled us to take control of the main tank.
we're about to cause the primary safety valves to fail.
do you remember the last time we saw each other, Ule?
it was at a state dinner in your residence.
we shared an excellent bottle of wine.
I offered my hand in friendship and you slapped it away.
you gave me an ultimatum-- to be the puppet for your military.
you could have had a long and prosperous career as prime minister.
but now you're going back to Sangala as a traitor to your people.
I am prime minister.
I was elected by the people.
it's you and Juma who are the traitors.
no. We brought order to Sangala, but you are trying to destroy everything that we've built.
you'll be taken back to Sangala, Ule, and you will give general Juma the names of all your fellow traitors.
I will never do that. Never.
believe me, you will.
take them.
any response from the president?
not yet.
but once she sees dead Americans lying in the street, she will be less stubborn.
I'm inside, Jack, approaching the front desk.
copy that.
are the Motobos still on the third floor?
affirmative, Jack. They're being moved. I'm just not sure where yet.
copy that.
good afternoon.
I'm agent Walker with the FBI.
I don't have an appointment, but I'm here to see Mr. Roane of Roane and associates.
I'll let them know you're here. - Actually, I don't want to be announced.
I'm here on official business.
all right.
so as far as you're concerned, I was never here, understand?
Yes, ma'am.
past security. Heading toward the elevator.
we're on our way to the service entrance.
Chloe, I'm on the third floor.
law firm is on your left.
on your right is a suite of offices where Matobo's being held.
I see it.
Stairwell's down the hallway to your left.
agent Walker, we're at the door.
there's one guard outside the suite, probably armed.
bill, take the third floor. Wait for my signal.
go on.
Chloe, we're on the fourth floor in what used to be the computer room. What now?
in the center of the room there are two removable panels.
this should give you access to the crawlspace.
copy that.
okay, we're clear. Let's go.
we're in.
I should never have allowed you to come with me.
it was a mistake.
it was not your decision, Ule.
we will be all right.
Jack Bauer will be here soon.
okay. We're at the heating unit.
okay, Jack, there's an airduct leading off that unit; do you see it?
Yeah.
follow that for about 30 yards until you see an electrical junction.
make a left, then another 20 yards you'll come to the vent.
this will give you a view of the entire floor.
and the Matobos?
they've been moved into a adjacent room just off the main area.
okay, copy that. Come on.
the entire NSA has been combing the firewall searching for the next CIP device breach.
if this were something, don't you think they'd already know about it?
I can live without your negativity today, Sean.
there it is again, that same code fragment.
Kidron, Ohio." What's in Kidron, Ohio? Any sensitive instaltions?"
something Dubaku might want to hit?
I don't know. Homeland has a high-value target database; I'm cross-checking it now.
okay. Okay, nothing in Kidron itself, but in the neighboring county there's...
Boyd Chemical. - Boyd Chemical. What do they make?
insecticide. Please get me that number.
Hello? This is Janis Gold at FBI.
I need to speak to your plant manager immediately, please.
ma'am, as I just stated I'm with the FBI.
does that sound vaguely important to you?
now, connect me to John Brunner.
FBI? Uh, yeah, put her on.
this is John Brunner.
hello. Mr. Brunner, this is Janis Gold, FBI, D. C.Bureau.
what can I do for you?
we've been tracking some possible breaches in the government firewall.
the firewall's designed to protect installations like yours...
I know what it does, honey.
um, we have tracked and isolated one of these breaches in the Kidron area.
I need to know are you experiencing any problems right now?
as a matter of fact, we're dealing with one right now.
what is it?
three of our safety valves just failed on the primary storage tank.
we're having trouble resetting them.
what's in that tank?
methyl isocyanate.
it's concentrated insecticide, highly toxic.
can you-- what the hell is this all about?
Mr. Brunner, I have reason to believe that this is a terrorist attack on your facility.
terrorist attack?
Yes, sir, I need you to initiate on-site emergency procedures and stay on this line.
shut down the tank.
what's going on? - Do it! Do it! My authority.
damn. What is it?
it's not responding. - What do you mean? Try it again.
nothing.
pressure in the primary tank is rising.
son of a bitch.
Mr. Brunner?
we cannot shut down the primary tank and the pressure is building.
if we cannot stop this, we are looking at atmospheric release.
okay.
get Larry. Dubaku has targeted that facility. We need to alert the president.
Mr. Brunner, you need to begin evacuating people right now.
all right, agent Moss, keep me apprised. I'll speak to the president.
I just received an interagency alert.
the FBI just discovered Dubaku's next target.
a chemical plant, yeah. I just got off the phone with Larry Moss.
I need to brief the president.
has the first gentleman spoken with the president?
not yet. I talked to agent Gedge 40 minutes ago.
Mr. Taylor is the only person who can talk the president into withdrawing our troops in Sangala.
and that is our best way to prevent this attack.
I know we need him. I'm waiting for a call back.
the middle section's still bothering me; read it again.
Colonel Dubaku and the Juma regime have killed "countless thousands of their own people, "and now hundreds of our fellow citizens.
they deserve your prayers and your outrage.
I think the word "outrage" might be too strong if you're trying to convey calm authority.
"outrage" is the only word to describe how I'm feeling, and how every person in this country will be feeling.
the American people deserve the truth.
Dubaku's already killed 300 Americans.
God knows what else he has planned.
come in.
could you excuse us, Angela?
what is it?
the FBI believes they've detected where the next attack will take place.
Dubaku's infiltrated a chemical plant just outside of Kidron, Ohio.
he's causing the pressure on the facility's primary tank to go critical.
if the tank erupts, over 3, 000 gallons of methyl isocyanate will be released into the atmosphere.
given the prevailing winds, a very large, very toxic cloud will sweep into town.
methyl isocyanate is a concentrated insecticide.
even brief exposure causes severe lung damage and chemical burns of the skin.
what's our time frame?
the tank could rupture in less than 15 minutes.
they've begun evacuating?
we've already contacted emergency responders on the ground in Kidron.
it's just not enough time to get everyone out.
Kidron's population's just over 30, 000.
this projection says that we could lose over 50%?
Oh, dear lord...
right now, our only chance of stopping this is finding Dubaku and the CIP device.
you ready? - Yeah.
quietly.
Jack, I just intercepted an FBI alert identifying Dubaku's next target.
a chemical plant near Kidron, Ohio, 12 minutes from going critical.
there are 30, 000 people in that town, Jack. We have to hurry.
copy that.
give me the scope out of the bag.
turning scope over to night-vision.
I don't see Dubaku.
we've got Nichols.
three men with automatic weapons.
three more over at the control station, most likely armed.
copy that.
that's Dubaku.
we got Dubaku. Chloe, are you seeing this?
Yes. The control station looks like an S-Dart. It's a really powerful processor.
it could be driving the CIP device.
copy.
NSA's classified infrastructure team is trying to plug the firewall breach.
any luck so far?
none so far, but they're staying on it.
they have less than ten minutes left.
they're aware of that, sir, but they're doing what they can.
not now. What's going on at the plant?
I'm on with them now.
John? Did you try flashing the memory cards?
three times, honey.
we're not in control of the computer system.
I've already told my people to get the hell out of here.
normally, I don't allow people to call me "honey," but we can discuss that later.
Yeah, well, it sounds like you need to lighten up.
good, good. I'm heading to the primary tank room.
I'm going to try to manually release some of the pressure.
that's not going to stop it.
no, but it might buy us a few more minutes so people can evacuate.
I've got a thousand workers at this facility.
and I am responsible for their safety.
now look, I need you to stay on the phone.
I'm going to need some help. - Absolutely. What can I do?
I don't have access to the override schematics.
see if you can pull up the operating procedures for tank one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. I got it right here.
all right. Now look for the emergency valve release sequence.
okay. Uh, valve release. I have it right here.
this, wait, this procedure is going to release the chemical right into the primary tank room where you are right now.
I know that. I have respiratory gear on.
I'll be okay, just give me the sequence.
but how long will that protect you?
don't worry about it, honey.
uh, okay.
are you looking at the routing board? - I am. Go ahead.
set the bus switches to this sequence from left to right:
two.
eight.
seven.
four.
three.
done.
the secondary flow valve should be behind you and to your right.
I need you to turn that clockwise please.
all right. All right, I got it.
okay, that's one valve down, three more to go.
pressure inside the tank is approaching 400 PSI.
how long before the tank ruptures?
seven minutes.
we've got a problem.
what is it?
an alert.
our hidden surveillance camera on the roof.
Almeida and Bauer.
when was this taken?
20 minutes ago.
I thought you killed Almeida and Bauer?
damn it!
you said this location was kept secret from everyone!
it was.
then what are they doing here?
I don't know.
how did they find us?
I don't know!
600 PSI and rising.
disengage the CIP module.
begin the offload.
what are you doing?
we're almost there.
we will continue this attack from another location.
let's finish this.
we can handle them.
we need to get out of here now.
the CIP module's disengaged, starting off load.
Hey, what the hell is that?
what the hell is that?
what's the matter?
the firewall breach just closed.
what?
what are you talking about?
no CIP intrusion, the firewall is secure.
how?
NSA?
I don't know.
bring the CIP module.
get Motobo and his wife!
bill, we should go with the second option on the assault.
two-prong attack.
you and Tony come through the main entrance.
we'll go in from here.
copy.
give me the C4 out of the bag.
go!
move.
move!
get the CIP device!
clear!
all clear over here!
get Dubaku?
negative!
Jack, I've got the CIP device.
it's been destroyed.
Jack, it's Renee.
the Motobos are safe.
I'm taking them to the van.
copy that.
I want you and Bill to do a sweep.
see if you can find Dubaku.
I'll cover the south side.
John, are you still there?
Yeah.
John, listen to me.
the terrorists are out of the system.
please tell me what is happening right now.
automatic shutdown mode has kicked in.
pressure's dropping.
I think we're gonna be all right.
okay, that's great.
now you-you gotta get out of there right now.
I can't make the door...
I'm sending the rescue team.
a rescue team is on its way.
John, please stay with me.
stay with me.
have they found Dubaku?
still searching.
first responders are five minutes away, Jack.
copy that.
get up.
I said get up!
they're coming.
please don't make me do this.
I will go to your home, Michael.
I'll make you wife watch as I kill your daughter, and then I will kill her.
so do as I ask.
save your family.
let me see your hands!
it's Latham.
Where's Dubaku?
I'm sorry.
cover!
Yeah! You all right?
Jack, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, we're okay.
what happened?
Latham was wired with explosives.
we still don't have Dubaku.
what?
the CIP device has been destroyed.
I want you to stay with the Motobos.
make sure they're safe.
Jack, the police are almost here.
if you get arrested, this entire operation goes out the window.
you have to get out of there.
copy that.
he's gone.
we need to get back to the safe house.
let's go.
Sean, this stays both NSA and Homeland have no idea why the breach at the Kidron plant was stopped.
they're still looking.
we're working on it here also.
Janis is coordinating with a digital forensics team that she sent over to the plant.
this doesn't make any sense.
why...
why would Dubaku suddenly stop an attack when he was minutes away from causing mass casualties?
maybe there was a malfunction in the CIP device.
no, no, I don't want maybes, all right?
I want answers.
we're doing everything we can, sir.
that's not good enough right now, is it?
I don't know what else to tell you, sir.
I know you're upset about Renee, but getting angry at me is not going to make it go any faster.
if you think I'm yelling at you because of my history with agent Walker, you are mistaken.
there are thousands of lives at stake here.
that's what concerns me.
sorry, sir.
I want you and Janis to work with NSA.
find out where that CIP device is being used.
if we find the device, we find Dubaku.
I appreciate the call.
thanks a lot.
Janis, Larry wants you to interface with NSA.
see if you can back-trace that CIP code fragment to its source.
I'll try.
who were you talking to?
the head of the response team at the plant.
what did he say?
facility's clean.
a trace amount of the chemical was released, but not enough to do any damage, and the site has been secured.
that's good.
what about the plant manager?
is he okay?
no.
will you do me a favor?
it depends.
I'd like to track down Mr. Brunner's family.
I was the last one to speak with him, and I feel they should know how brave he was.
I'll see what I can find.
thank you.
Janis, before you start sending flowers, you need to find out where that CIP device was being used.
I know.
I'm on it.
cleanup crews are already on site and we're continuing our evacuation of a one-mile radius around the chemical plant.
casualties?
there was, in fact, one casualty, the plant manager.
13 other workers are being treated for chemical burns and inhalation of toxic fumes.
and there haven't been any other intrusions in the firewall?
no, ma'am.
it appears the crisis has been averted.
except that no one's been able to explain how the firewall break disengaged.
not yet.
the FBI has no idea how it happened...
it just happened.
and that's not an explanation.
perhaps Dubaku was firing another warning shot.
no, Dubaku's already down two planes.
he's not afraid to take more lives.
in any event, we should be grateful.
I'm not one to accept good news unless I know where it comes from.
until we have more answers, I want to maintain alert levels.
yes?
madam president, I have admiral Smith on line two.
put him through.
thank you, Tim.
Admiral?
I've been trying to reach agent Gedge, and he hasn't picked up.
Yes, I'm sure I have the right number.
I just spoke to him over an hour ago.
he said he was outside Samantha Roth's apartment waiting for the first gentleman.
just find him.
I don't care who you have to pull off shift.
still can't reach Gedge.
the secret service doesn't know where he is either.
I need to tell the president.
maybe you should hold off.
the domestic threat's been lifted for now and she's on the phone with admiral Smith.
I can't authorize the air strikes until our post-invasion plans are in place.
finding a politically viable replacent, until that happens, you need to keep your forces at full readiness.
the joint chiefs are getting impatient.
madam president, we need to talk about your husband.
his theory about your son's death, he hasn't let it go.
what are you talking about?
he's been harassing Roger's girlfriend, accusing her of complicity in the death of Roger.
Henry and I went over it again and again with the FBI, and he swore to me he was past all that.
well, he's found a private investigator who's feeding his conspiracy theory; taking advantage of him.
please get Henry on the phone.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Henry's unreachable.
I don't understand.
agent Gedge hasn't been answering his phone.
now, I wouldn't get too worried yet.
you're telling me my husband's gone missing?
secret service has put out an APB.
they're going to Ms. Roth's apartment.
whatever's going on, I will find out soon enough.
secret service dispatcher: This is a priority order code Charlie Zero Charlie.
we need an immediate 20 on agent Gedge.
all available field agents proceed to his last known location: 404 Wilkinson Drive.
you're making a mistake.
think about it.
shut up!
you haven't killed anybody yet.
you don't need to do this.
gedge's plan to frame me is already blown.
if you kill me, they'll know it was murder, and they'll trace it back to you.
go ahead.
Where's agent Gedge?
I can't reach him.
Gedge is dead.
what happened?
everything was going according to plan...
but something went wrong.
Taylor killed Gedge; I don't know how.
Where's Mr. Taylor now?
he's right here.
don't kill him, bring him to me.
Yes, sir.
prime minister Matobo, ma'am, please come with me.
Chloe, pull up the Ritter Building on a satellite grid.
look for any sign of Dubaku leaving the site.
we've got to find him.
it's going to take me 20 minutes to task the satellite.
then don't waste time talking about it.
pull up satellite and traffic cams, street corners and metro stations.
what's the priority?
I can only do one thing at time.
satellite!
fine.
bill, we need to rethink this.
what do you mean?
you were set up to surveil an undercover operation.
your cover's been blown.
the police are after us.
we are not equipped to look for one man in a city of millions.
we need additional resources.
what are you suggesting?
it's time to contact outside agencies.
the government?
Yes.
I thought you said the government couldn't be trusted.
right now, we don't have a choice.
it can't be trusted.
we can't trust anybody, that's why we're working on the outside.
president Taylor can be trusted.
I'm not questioning that, prime minister.
it's the people around her who can't be trusted.
Mr. Buchanan, Jack's right.
we need help.
it's too dangerous.
we can limit the flow of information.
prime minister Matobo can get us past the president's outer circle
that way, we can at least explain to her why and what we're doing.
I think Jack's right.
we left a lot of clues in that building.
we're vulnerable; we can't do this on our own anymore.
am I supposed to remain in hiding with you, pretend that my wife and I are still being held hostage or dead?
I need to return to the White House and help the president save what's left of my country.
let my husband do this.
let him call president Taylor.
she will listen to him.
bill, you want to find Dubaku, make the call.
all right.
get me the White House.
representatives from Boyd Chemical have assured local authorities that the immediate crisis s passed.
however, this has done little to calm the nerves of the citizens of Kidron, Ohio, many of whom have taken shelter in neighboring communities.
again, we have confirmed one fatality inside the plant itself.
13 others, all Boyd employees, are being treated at local medical centers...
Madame President,- Yes?
I have prime minister Matobo call for you.
Yes, ma'am.
you're tracing it?
we tried, Madame President, but it's a secure line.
put him through.
prime minister?
Yes, Madame President.
are you all right?
thank god, my wife and I are both fine.
we were rescued.
by whom?
where are you?
in a safe place.
Madame President, you need to listen to me.
the people who rescued us, they have acquired the CIP device.
it has been destroyed, and your country is no longer under immediate threat.
who are these people, and tell me how this happened.
I will tell you everything in person, but, uh, this must happen privately.
I must speak to you alone.
why alone?
they will bring me to you, Madame President.
we will arrive in ten minutes.
I'll be waiting for you.
they tried to trace the call, but the line held.
Ethan, I need to see you right now.
Yes, Madame President?
I just spoke to prime minister Matobo.
what?
he's safe.
how?
what happened?
he'll let us know when he gets here.
he's on his way now.
he wants a private meeting.
bring him in through the south entrance, and keep this to as few people as possible.
all right.
Jack, I've mapped a route for you to the White House.
it's mostly side streets, but there will be fewer traffic cams.
okay, good. Send it to my phone.
we're ready.
let's go.
as soon as we set the vehicle in front of the building, agent Walker will move Mr. Matobo.
what?
I'm not going.
what are you talking about?
if the government gets their hands on Tony, they'll arrest him.
I already told you-- I did some pretty bad things before I teamed up with Bill.
Tony, take it from me...
you need to deal with the consequences.
and believe me, I will.
but not yet.
not till we get Dubaku.
I'm working on a lead.
I've got a guy on Emerson's crew who might have some intel we can use.
let him do this, Jack.
he's the reason we got this far.
fine.
but you give me your word as soon as this as over, you turn yourself in.
we'll stand behind you.
all right, you have my word.
good luck.
be careful.
I was on my way to work, so I thought I'd stop in and see you.
I tried calling you earlier.
I'm sorry; I've been busy.
are you all right?
you look exhausted.
it's just been a long day.
well, I hope you're still coming over for dinner.
I'm making lasagna.
and my sister promises not to give you any more dirty looks.
you haven't forgotten, have you?
no.
no.
it's just that I've got some business to attend to.
samuel, you work too much.
every time you come into the diner, you're always on the phone.
I have to, Maria, so that, one day,
I can finally take you away from that awful place that you work in.
well, we met in that awful place.
don't forget that.
I'll see you later.
okay.
go ahead.
have you got Mr. Taylor?
Yes.
I'm about three minutes away.
there's a Korean grocer opposite my building.
one of my men will meet you out back.
bring Taylor inside.
what are you gonna do to him?
just make sure you weren't followed.
have you made the preparations?
are you sure you want to leave now, colonel?
can't imagine general Juma will be pleased
to learn that you're abandoning your mission.
the mission is over.
you think I'm a fool, Mr. Burnett?
if anything should happen to me on my way out of the country
the data file with all the names and bank transactions
of all those involved will be sent to the justice department
when the car arrives, we would like you
to go with the driver
so that we could follow you back to Dubaku.
you want her to go to him and face him?
it's the only chance we have of finding him before
he disappears forever. I'll do it.
you keep her safe, you hear me?
we will.
Colonel!
FBI.
go! go!
I want the names of everyone in the United States government
that you've been working with.
I have a list.
I found some kind of digital storage device
implanted under Dubaku's skin.
can you upload the files to FBI?
marika didn't make it.
you killed my sister. - I'm so sorry.
what do you want from me?!
I just want to know that you feel something
I want to know that you feel the same kind of pain as I do.
do you feel that?!
I'm working with FBI
to coordinate an interagency sweep.
we should start making arrests within the hour.
what you have done here today puts all of us in your debt.
there are a lot of people to thank,
including Jack Bauer.
what are you asking me to do, Bill?
I'm asking you to speak to senator Mayer.
Jack bauer helped save this country.
he doesn't deserve to spend the rest of his life in prison.
I'm going to the white house. - Sir?
president taylor wants to speak to me regarding Jack Bauer.
grab your laptop, Ryan.
I want you there with me.
there's gonna be another attack.
here in D. C.
my source tells me
that the window opens at 19:00 hours.
what's the target?
he doesn't know the exact target,
but it's definitely going to be of high value
and high impact.
he gave me the name of somebody - Who's been involved in the planning. - Who?
Ryan Burnett.
senator Mayer's chief of staff.
that's right.
units in place. Operation on schedule.
the following takes place between 6 p. m. and 7 p. m.
hold on a second.
go ahead.
ICU.
one moment, please.
Corinna, you got a call on three.
who is it?
Dr. May. He's got a question.
doctors are so helpless.
Dr. May?
Hello?
there was no one there.
if he calls back, tell him
I'll call him back in a minute.
code blue.
code blue! we have a code blue in the ICU!
get agent Walker down to ICU now!
swift and decisive is how the pentagon describes
the u. s. invasion now underway in Sangala.
sporadic resistance, minimal casualties.
this in direct contrast to assertions made
by Sangalese leader Benjamin Juma
on state-supported television.
our brave soldiers are beating back the enemy
all across Sangala city.
history is on our side, my friends.
we survived their slave ships,
and we will survive their warships, too.
declaring victory while his own troops are fleeing the capital,
and his palace lies in ruins.
when do we think this was made?
my guess is these recordings were made
some time before the invasion, ma'am.
which begs the question, John.
where is he, and why haven't we found him yet?
special forces teams all over Sangala city
are searching for him.
there is some intelligence to suggest
he may have fled the country.
Admiral Smith, you and I
both know that Juma must be captured.
he must be tried and convicted of his crimes against humanity
otherwise, we've as good as failed.
he can't go far, ma'am.
no country on earth will grant him asylum.
then find him, admiral Smith.
wherever he is.
general Juma?
beautiful, isn't it?
sir?
it's not a trick question, Laurent.
it is beautiful.
why not?
it is almost time.
the men-- are they ready?
Yes, sir.
are they afraid?
I don't know, sir, but some of them are praying.
it's good if they are afraid.
it means they will fight bravely.
have you heard from my father yet, sir?
I thought he was supposed to be meeting us here.
don't worry, Laurent.
he will be here.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Colonel Dubaku is dead. Are you certain?
the dose I administered was catastrophic.
his son just asked me about him.
he must never know about this,
or about his father's cowardice.
he won't.
then nothing will stand in our way, Udo. but hurry.
the attack window is narrowing.
the timing must be precise.
clear! - yes, sir.
clear.
one more time at 360.
clear.
nothing.
going again, doctor?
no.
that's it, everybody. I'm calling it.
time death 06 p. m.
Dr. Stahl, what's going on?
a massive heart attack.
you said that he was stable, that he was going to be okay.
so, what happened?
I'm not sure.
maybe a preexisting condition.
the autopsy will tell us. Excuse me.
the wide extent of the corruption requires a coordinated approach.
we know the government's been compromised.
we just don't know at what level.
presently, Chloe O'brian is vetting the names
department by department.
I'm prioritizing secret service, so the president is secured as soon as possible.
team leaders will then receive their assignments
defense, treasury, state, et cetera and make their arrests contemporaneously across the district.
O'Brian. Chloe, it's Jack.
have the names from Dubaku's database been handed over to the arrest teams yet?
not yet. - Okay, listen to me.
I've just learned that Juma's operatives are planning another attack.
Jack, they're telling us here it's over.
that's wrong. Tony's my source on the intel.
do you know what the target is?
only that it's high value, high casualty, and that it's happening now, which is why I need your help.
there's a man on the list, a Ryan Burnett.
he's Senator Mayer's Chief of Staff.
Mayer? Isn't he the guy who grilled you this morning at the senate subcommittee hearing?
Yeah, but the Senator's not implicated in the conspiracy.
but Burnett has been providing support for Juma and Dubaku all along.
Chloe, I need you to delete his name from the list.
what? Why?
if the FBI start to move in on him, he'll lawyer up, and no one will get the information on time.
where is he now?
he's at the white house with the Senator.
they've got a meeting with the president.
I'm on my way there now to be debriefed by Bill.
I'll take care of him then.
Jack, you don't expect to interrogate a suspect in the white house?
let me handle that.
Chloe, just get his name deleted from the list.
I'll get back to you.
she's in.
how close are we? -Close.
is there anything I can do to help?
I'm just cycling through the last layer of data now.
you know, it might be quicker if you send the subsets to my station one by one.
good idea.
and then that way
I can get to work on distributing them.
okay, then. Thank you.
listen, Jack, maybe you should reconsider.
reconsider what?
taking Bill into your confidence.
look, I mean, he's been a part of this operation since the get-go.
I don't know what it's going to take to get Burnett to talk.
if I have to use extreme measures...
I don't get it. What, you don't think he'll go there?
I'm driving off a cliff here, Tony.
I don't need to put Bill in the passenger seat.
all right, then, fine. I'll go with you.
you're a wanted felon.
you wouldn't get past the first checkpoint.
besides, with all of the government agencies still compromised, it might be up to you to stop the attack.
see you on the other side.
yes?
can you extend the attack window?
not without risking the entire operation.
Why?
there's been a complication.
I may be stuck here longer than I anticipated.
I'll call you back.
Mr. Kanin.
Ryan Burnett, Senator Mayer's Chief of Staff.
we've spoken on the phone. - Many times.
it's good to finally meet you.
likewise. The Senator's inside.
right this way.
senator?
well, Senator, I see you've found the bar.
mind if I join you?
something I never knew.
if it ain't from Kentucky, you can't call it Bourbon.
spare me the southern gentleman routine, Ethan.
the president didn't call me up here at the ass-end of the day to drink her booze and flip through a briefing book.
I thought it might be helpful, before your meeting, to bring you up to speed on the events of the last ten hours.
okay.
I'm up to speed.
senator, surely you have some reaction to what you just read.
damn right I have a reaction.
I want to know what all this has to do with Jack Bauer.
I mean, that's the reason I'm here, right?
without Mr. Bauer, we would never have uncovered the conspiracy in the first place nor the people behind it.
his efforts, in conjunction with those of the FBI, are largely responsible for the arrests being made right now across the district.
you're not saying that he's acting in an official capacity?
I don't have to tell you how this looks, Ethan.
colluding with a rogue operative from a disbanded agency.
I'm sorry you see it that way.
how else am I supposed to see it?
the way the president does
that Jack Bauer saved lives today, plain and simple, including her husband's.
look, Senator, I know this isn't easy for you.
the public battle you've waged against detainee abuse and human rights violations...
are you seriously asking me to look the other way on this?
I have been after this son of a bitch for years.
he's a thug, Ethan.
he's exhibit "a.
the president is prepared to reverse policy and support your amendment to the war crimes act.
in exchange for what exactly?
the hearings.
declare a recess till after the holidays
and then quietly let Mr. Bauer's subpoena expire.
and if I refuse to go along?
the president is prepared to invoke executive privilege.
executive privilege--meaning what exactly?
well, that's for the president to decide.
are you talking about a pardon?
I wouldn't rule it out.
well, if that's how the president wants to play it,
you can tell her she just walked into a street fight.
you can tell her yourself.
Jack.
Hi, bill. you got here sooner than i expected.
Jack. - Put down your weapon now!
step away from the desk!
take a seat.
sit down, bill!
okay, okay, I'm sitting.
now, what's this all about?
where is ryan burnett? what?
senator mayer's chief of staff-- where is he?
I'm not saying anything until you tell me
what the hell's going on.
Tony doubled back to one of his contacts,
who gave him information of a second attack.
it's going to take place here in washington within the hour.
Juma's operatives are carrying it out.
Burnett's been supporting them all along.
he knows where the attack's going to take place, so you can
either tell me where he is or i will find him myself.
Jack, I can't.
fine, put your hands behind your back now.
how good is the intel?
good enough for me to need to talk to him.
don't you move.
Jack, let me have him arrested.
there are other ways to deal with this.
the attack window's open. We're out of time.
Jack, listen to me.
I spoke to the president on your behalf.
she's going to intervene with senator mayer,
stop the hearings.
you can get your life back.
you do this, you're throwing it all away.
I wish I thought there was another option.
let me help you at least, jack.
you don't have to do this alone.
Yes, I do.
it's the only way I can make sure to keep you out of this.
Jack. - Bill, I'm sorry.
Jack, w-w-wait!
Jack!
it's all right.
don't fight it.
this is Moss.
Larry, it's me.
Dubaku's dead.
I thought the doctors said he was stabilized.
what happened?
officially,
they're characterizing that it was a coronary
brought on by systemic shock.
sounds like you don't believe it.
I did a follow-up with the hospital admin.
she confirmed that there was an eight-member team on duty
when Dubaku flatlined.
yeah?
there was a ninth man in the ICU
just before the code was called-- an orderly.
I ran back the tapes on the ward
and that's when I spotted him.
the things is I've asked around and nobody seems to know who he is.
Renee, wait, a-are you saying you think dubaku was murdered?
I'm saying that there was an unidentified man in with Dubaku
just before he went into cardiac arrest.
what does the admin say?
she says that they often use floaters-- Personnel from other area hospitals
filling in from time to time.
said it's not uncommon for the regular staff
not to know who they are.
she's double-checking with payroll now.
right, so there's your answer.
still it seems odd.
I mean, what if Dubaku knew something
and they needed to shut him up?
is this Bauer's theory, too?
Jack's not even here
and, you know, I resent that implication, Larry.
what implication is that?
I am not the one calling the shots.
this has been my investigation from the beginning,
not Jack Bauer's.
I was just asking a question.
I wasn't implying anything.
you there? - I'm sorry.
I guess I'm a little sensitive on the subject.
look, everything we needed from dubaku, we got.
names and bank accounts Of every corrupt official on his payroll.
teams are in the field as we speak.
so you're saying you want me to come in.
we need you back in the office sooner than later
to help process all these arrests.
Larry, look, I've got security searching the hospital
and reviewing more video.
so, what, you want to follow that up first?
fine, call me when you clear it. yeah.
I will.
Thanks, Larry.
excuse me, agent Walker?
that orderly you were looking for
one of our parking lot cameras - Picked him up getting into his car. - When?
uh, about 15 minutes ago.I've got a screen grab
of his license plate.
thank you.
this is agent Walker.
put me through to our DMV contact.
are you busy?
I'm just reformatting the server,
so, yeah, I guess I am busy. why?
well, I was cross-referencing Dubaku's offshore accounts
and I came across an orphaned header fragment.
what are you talking about?
take a look.
okay, see, there, right there, right there.
it's a remnant file header.
it's probably just a phantom data string.
no, it isn't.
I ran a systems analysis.
the coding is not random.
it can be traced back
to one of the accounts.
also, it looks like a name was deleted
from the list.
why don't I run a recovery program?
well, you're very busy with the reformatting and all,
so why don't I just upload it to my station and take care of it there?
well, that's okay, I can do it faster.
no offense.
I'll let you know if I retrieve anything.
sure.
Thanks.
thank you.
Yeah.
have you gotten to Burnett yet?
working on it.
making my way over to the west wing.
someone here has figured out
that a name has been deleted from the database.
I don't know how much longer I can hold her off.
do they know it was burnett?
no, but it's just a matter of time.
okay, i'll get back to you.
great.
senator, I'll head back to the hill and get with sandy.
we should have a press release drafted
by the time you finish your meeting.
I'm also going to need a sit-down with your friend hauser at the post.
off the record, I assume.
we've got to make pardoning jack bauer as politically toxic
for the president as possible.
she's a woman in a highly emotional state.
her husband's been shot.
you suggesting her judgment's impaired?
I'm suggesting that a case could be made.
excuse me, senator.
president taylor is ready to see you now.
go ahead, senator.
I'll get this to the ag,
tell him you want the option to go ahead
with the hearings tomorrow as scheduled.
Thanks, Ryan.
yes?
it's Burnett.
you took care of the problem?
I'm leaving now.
good, then we rendezvous at 2130 hours, as planned.
I'll be there.
excuse me, I'll be out of here
in just one second.
you and I...
...we're going to have a talk.
we've got a command post set up at EEOB,
and we'll brief cia and diplomatic security,
but not until after the first sweep of arrests.
look, nobody is going anywhere, phil.
we've dropped a net on the city.
and I'll let you know as soon as that happens.
all right.
Yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need you to listen to something.
may I? - Yeah, that's fine.
she's supposed to be this whiz-bang systems analyst,
which is actually what tipped me off in the first place.
her demeanor is so bizarre...
w-w-whoa, Janis,
who are you talking about?
Chloe O'brian.
I ran a systems check on her work, and it turns out
there's evidence of file tampering.
plus she's been scrambling all her out-of-office phone call
so I had operations archive
her cellular traffic.
I did a work-around.
listen.
Yeah.
have you gotten to burnett yet?
working on it.
making my way over to the west wing.
someone here has figured out
that a name has been deleted from the database.
I don't know how much longer i can hold her off.
do they know it was burnett?
no, but it's just a matter of time.
okay, i'll get back to you.
Becker.
in the conference room.
I want Chloe O'brian detained.
and get her off that server. Yes.
Mrs. O'Brian? You need to come with me.
get me the white house.
let me just remind you, madam president,
you supported the effort
to ban abuse and torture.
you campaigned to reform the intelligence agencies.
these past ten hours, senator,
things haven't appeared as black and white as they once did.
well, there's nothing gray about jack bauer.
the man has committed atrocities.
prisoners have died in his custody.
Mr. Bauer has served under the aegis
of three presidents, not just me.
is it any more lawful or any less repugnant
if it's authorized at the highest level?
a state of war is not a blank check
for the president or for anyone.
Oh, don't lecture me, senator.
I am well aware of the limits of my power.
due respect, madam president...
your power is great.
just be careful
that you use it to send the right message.
all I'm asking you to do
is excuse Mr. Bauer as a witness.
it's not a message.
it is an expression of gratitude for what he's done today.
you're asking me to excuse him
as a target of the investigation.
and the message is clear.
under certain circumstances,
you believe his methods are acceptable.
some would argue that they are.
and they would be wrong.
under any military or moral standard.
america has been down this road before, madam president.
you yourself called it a national tragedy.
it was a tragedy.
I still believe that.
pardon Jack Bauer,
and you're telling every interrogator in the field
that it's open season again.
I'm sorry to interrupt, madam president.
there's an urgent call from larry moss at fbi.
put him through.
agent Moss is on the line.
agent Moss,
this is Ethan Kanin.
you're on speaker with the president.
madam president, forgive me for coming directly
you have a meeting this evening with senator Mayer?
in fact, I do.
I'm with him right now.
did the senator's Chief of staff, Ryan Burnett, accompany
the senator to the white house?
Yes, he did, agent Moss-- why?
I have reason to believe that Jack Bauer
is carrying out an off-book interrogation of Mr. Burnett
as we speak.
I can pull the trigger 128 more times before this battery dies.
I'm telling you,
I don't know anything about an attack.
stop lying to me.
I'm not lying. - What's the target?
I can't tell you what I don't know. - Mr. Burnett,
you are a traitor and a terrorist.
I'm not.
I love my country.
that was 1, 200 volts of current.
now, when I eject this cartridge,
I access the drive stun mode,
upping the voltage 40 times when directly administered.
all you need to do is talk to me.
Mr. Burnett, it's really simple.
just tell me what the target is, -And this will be all over. -I promise.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
this is your last chance. -if I knew,
I would tell you, I swear it.
what do you want me to say?
just... just tell me what to say, and I'll say it.
don't you even try and play that game with me.
Mr. Burnett, I've been doing this a long time,
and I can tell the difference,
especially when a man is under duress,
if he's got information that I need
or if I'm just wasting my time.
and I promise you, I am not wasting my time.
the next jolt
is gonna be in your throat.
anything above your neck runs the risk
of a complete neuromuscular shutdown.
that means you run the risk of becoming paralyzed.
no, please.
Mr. Burnett, you built the entire federal case
against me.
you of all people should know how far I am willing to go
to stop this attack from happening.
so, I'm gonna ask you one last time.
where is the target?!
I...
okay, okay, okay.
I'm listening.
soldiers.
how many?
a unit.
Juma's presidential guard.
when?
it already started.
where?
Where?!
Mr. Bauer,
this is president taylor.
where is the target?
Mr. Bauer... where?!
Mr. Bauer, I am ordering you to answer this page.
Mr. Bauer, do you hear me?
damn it!
madam president, this is Jack Bauer.
I don't know what you've heard so far,
but this thing is not over.
there is another terrorist attack
going to take place within minutes.
there will be no discussion until you unlock this door.
madam president, the attack window is open.
Juma's men are moving.
what you're doing is against the law, Mr. Bauer.
I am your commander in chief, and I am ordering you
to stand down.
how much longer, sergeant?
good to go, ma'am. -do it.
Where's the target?
where is the target?!
where is...?!
I had him!
man down.
EMTs to the visiting dignitary suite.
you're done, Bauer.
you're finished.
he was talking.
whatever's going to happen is happening now,
and it's on your conscience.
my conscience has a lot less to answer for than yours.
Mr. Bauer, you say an attack is imminent.
my source intel is good.
who is your source?
I'd rather not say.
the name, Mr. Bauer.
Tony Almeida.
Tony Almeida-- the man's a fugitive.
without tony Almeida, we would never
have recovered the cip device.
madam president,
I don't care if his source
is the blessed virgin Mary.
nothing justifies what went on in this room.
even if he's right, blaine?
even if it means we could save lives?
look at that, and tell me it's not barbarism.
is that something you can live with?
earlier today, madam president,
two airplanes were brought down.
is that something you can live with?
you're reprehensible, bauer.
and you, sir, are weak!
unwilling and unable
to look evil in the eye and deal with it.
Ethan, step out for a second.
suddenly, it's not so hypothetical, is it?
in your opinion,
is Bauer's intelligence actionable?
if Bauer says there's going to be an attack,
my belief is, there's going to be an attack.
torture was originally intended to force false confessions.
now we use it to try and find the truth.
these people murdered your son, madam president.
they attempted to murder your husband.
they will stop at nothing.
sergeant, take Mr. Bauer away.
he's under arrest.
you should have come to me.
you should have presented your case.
we didn't have time.
and would it really have made a difference, ma'am?
madam president...
you're doing the right thing.
271 dead already.
I wish to god it felt more like the right thing.
Ethan, raise the threat levels.
tell homeland that they have
to come up with a response scenario.
and get Tim down here.
also, I want to talk to Mr. Burnett myself.
let me do that.
I know the man.
apparently, you don't.
Tim, I understand the threat level
has been raised, but only for first responders and federal agents.
there's a concern that mass evacuation
by the public could hamper efforts
to thwart an attack when it comes.
what about the airspace over washington?
restricted.
military flyovers are commencing.
DOD has recommended that we deploy mobile teams to sweep the area
for radioactive and biological signatures.
I'll call Phillip at the pentagon and push it through.
what about nsa?
there's elevated anti-american chatter
coming from the usual web sites and telephone traffic,
but nothing specific to the attack.
thank you, Tim.
I'll see you upstairs in 15 minutes. -yes, ma'am.
which means our best source of intelligence
is still right here under our noses.
you realize we're gonna have to offer this bastard a free pass.
with coercive measures off the table,
it's our only option.
Bauer's going to prison, and a traitor walks.
what's wrong with this picture?
I need a minute with the prisoner.
Mr. Burnett,
you will be charged with treason under title 18,
section 2381, of the united states code.
giving aid and comfort to the enemy
and directly causing the death of American citizens.
do you understand?
surely, you have something to say for yourself.
I demand my right to counsel.
you'll have your counsel, Mr. Burnett,
but first, you're going to tell me everything you know.
not in this lifetime.
what did you say? -I said,
not in this lifetime.
don't be so quick to make up your mind, Mr. Burnett.
in exchange for information which stops
or significantly mitigates this attack,
the president is prepared to grant you full immunity from prosecution.
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
if you and your family are being threatened in any way...
do you realize what the president is offering you?
treason is a capital offense, Mr. Burnett.
if you don't cooperate with us right now,
I will make it my personal mission
to see that you pay the ultimate price for your crimes.
I won't condone torture, but in your case,
I would have no problem with the death penalty.
Where's my lawyer?
Walker -It's me.
that situation at the hospital you told me about?
Yeah, I'm on it, Larry.
I traced a license plate to an import/export firm.
tell me.
the orderly I mentioned
he just joined up with about a dozen soldiers.
Africans. heavily armed.
where are you?
44543 Lambourne Marina, near Johnson park.
I'm in the warehouse basement.
Renee, we have intel
on another attack by Juma's people.
it's happening in d. c. sometime after 1900 hours.
this is it, Larry. no question.
all right, listen, sit tight.
I'm on my way with back up. - Make it quick.
Janis, scramble a chopper.
on the roof in two minutes.
okay. but also... -Janis,
just do it.
this is Larry Moss.
put me through to metro police.
charters, Turner-- with me.
general,
there is no sign of my father.
I just spoke with him.
unfortunately he won't be able to join us.
why not?
because he got delayed in his attempt to secure safe passage for us
from the country.
then, sir,
let me take his place on the assault team.
spoken like a true dubaku,
Laurent.
but you are also my only reconnaissance officer. -but, general...
no, I need you on the perimeter to provide intelligence
and also to disrupt whatever rescue operations there may be.
understood?
understood, sir.
make your final preparations.
it is time for us to go. -Yes, sir.
Larry, hurry, they're moving out.
we're ten minutes away.
is it possible that juma himself is leading this attack?
Juma? why do you say that?
I know it sounds crazy, but I swear that I just saw him.
What?! here?!
are you sure? -unless he has an identical twin.
all right, I'll alert homeland.
good work.
any idea what the next target is?
negative.
see if you get a fix on that. but, listen,
don't take any chances.
all right?
I won't.
sir.
you should have an emt take a look at you. -I'm fine.
is Bauer in custody? -Yes, sir.
he's in holding. -that'll be all.
Tony, it's Bill.
bill, Jack's under arrest.
they've got him locked down in a holding cell here.
listen to me, Bill... - No, you listen.
we still don't know where this attack's taking place.
Burnett didn't break?
no. They stopped Jack before he could get the information.
and Burnett didn't go for the president's immunity deal.
you were the one who brought Jack the intel, right?
that's right.
how real is it?
very.
who was your contact?
it was a guy in Emerson's crew with a direct line to Juma.
any chance we get another crack at this guy?
that's highly unlikely,
to say the least.
what are you telling me, he's dead?
that's right?
I wish to god you'd brought me in on this.
Jack didn't want to put you in that position.
for what it's worth,
he was trying to protect you, Bill.
did you have a fallback plan, at least?
immunity for burnett was the fallback.
that's it? nothing else?
no.
nothing.
I keep trying Renee, and I keep getting her voice mail.
what the hell's going on?
there's something wrong with her phone.
what do you mean, something's wrong?
I just spoke to her five minutes ago.
can you triangulate her position?
I can't. -why not?
there's no signal.
either the battery's dead,
or her cell got damaged somehow.
all right, keep trying.
get back to me when you know something. -okay.
from our location
it is approximately 100 meters to the entrance.
from this point forward,
we maintain radio silence
until the target is secure.
understood?
Yes, sir. understood.
you all have your assignments.
may god be with us.
Laurent, take your position.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Burnett you are a traitor and a terrorist.
Where's the target? Where's the target?
take Mr. Bauer away. He's under arrest.
ha you learned anything else about the attack?
Renee Walker followed a lead on her own.
got a visual on a heavily armed commando unit lead by Juma himself.
bill Buchanan.
Renee Walker says the target is the white house.
condition red. Secure the president.
there's no safe path out.
weeed to secure her in the first floor lockdown.
hostage rescue tea are moving into place.
they'll be prepared to storm the building as soon as the order's given.
Mr. Vice president, terrorists are in control of the white house.
until you can provide me more intel on what's going on in there, you are instructed to refrain from launching any action.
president Taylor is locked in the safe room.
what is it I can do for you?
I need you to find me another way in.
well, I'm looking at the white house manifest, and according to ts, Olivia Taylor is presently in the building with you.
you find Olivia Taylor, and you'll get the president to open that door.
president Taylor... - God, no.
if you don't open the door, I'm ing to cut out your daughter's eyes one by one.
open the door. - Madam president...
no, open the door. Open the door! - I can't do that. I can't!
do you have children, Jack?
I have a daughter.
could you do what you're asking me to do? Just stand by and watch her butchered?
no, ma'am, but I am not the present the united states.
well, I am the president, and I am ordering you to open that door.
all right, general, you've got me now.
There'no reason to hold anyone else. Let them go.
now, whawe do know is that the president was in the building when the attack took place, and she may have been taken hostage along with numerous other white house personnel.
vice president hayworth was not in the building, and we're told he was moved to a secure location.
the FBI has cordoned off a nine-block perimeter... - Mr. Vice president, that was agent Moss.
what does he have to say?
he's still requesting that you authorize a rescue operation.
does he have any more intel about what the hell's going on in there?
no, sir.
he deployed two units with deep-band parabolics, but all they were able to get w static.
they think Juma's using some kind of jamming equipment.
they've also got spotters at every possible angle around the building, but they haven't been ae to see inside.
we still don't know whether Juma has the president, or whether the president is lked inside the safe room?
no, sir, we don't.
I will not authorize any action until I know the status of the president.
relay that to agent Moss.
Yes, sir.
mom, I know that I hurt you.
I'm so sorry for cutting you out of my life.
it's okay... - no, it isn't.
you were right to fire me off election campaign.
I felt so betrayed, I turned my back on you.
Olivia, don't worry about it.
it all seems so stupid now.
I hope you can forgive me.
darling, I forgave you a long time ago.
Livy, you have to listen to me.
we really are going to be okay.
just keep your eyes open and be ready.
no, no. - Get up.
leave her alone! Get away from her!
get back!
I said leave her alone! Please!
Olivia, it's okay, darling. It's okay!
bill, we needto make a move to try to save the president.
how?
in the lockdown room, there were five canisters of ch-4.
before we surrendered ourselves over to Juma, I opened the valves.
within the next few minutes, that room is going to be saturated with natural gas.
it's going to take one spark to set it off.
I think the explosion is going to be large enough to take out most of Juma's men.
that's when you can make your move how do we set it off?
I'll me a run for the lockdown room. Try and draw their fire.
all we need is one stray bullet.
that's a suicide play, Jack.
we don't have a choice.
just make sure you can get to the president and get her out of here.
she knows about the plan; she'll be read what are you planning? Are you going to do something?
when it happens, you'll know about it, senator.
damn it, if you're planning something, I want to know what it is.
senator, shut up.
read this statement.
it is a confession of your crimes against my country.
the atrocities that you have committed will now be seen by the whole world.
I'll read your statement, general, but I need you to release the other hostages.
you got what you came for. You have the president of the united states.
as a sign of good faith...
I will release one of the hostages.
you... stand up.
do you want me to release any more hostages, president Taylor?
you son of a bitch.
you will read this statement or I will do the same thing to everyone here...
starting with your daughter.
general, the uplink is complete.
all right.
the world is waiting, madam president.
this is theresident of the united states.
six hoursgo, I ordered our armed forces "to invade sangala without warning and without provocation.
this attack was a cminal act motivated solely "by america's desire "to exert its power and influence.
tell me you're shutting this down.
we can't, sir. It's a live feed straight to the internet.
I don't care. Shut it down.
it's going out on multiple servers, sir.
it would take hours just to trace them.
this is derek watt hold on.
sir, it's agent Moss on teleconference. - Put him on.
sir, are you getting this? - Yes.
so is the rest of theamn world.
Mr. Vice president, I believe Juma came here to humiliate the president and stage a public execution.
we have a rescue operation in place. All we need is your authorization.
you don't know what Juma's intentions are.
this could be a prelude to a set of demands.
there are no demands here, sir. This is about revenge.
Juma knows he'll never get out of the white house alive.
you're speculating, agent Moss.
my advisorare telling me the most prudent course of action is to try to initiate communication with Juma.
we've been trying to do that. He hasn't responded.
sir, Juma has no desire to negotiate anything.
hes going to kill the president.
sir, we have a tactical plan in place.
it's a two-pronged assault, and we're confident that it stands a good chance of catching juma off guard, but we're losing time. We have to initiate now.
I cann authorize any action at might result in the president's death.
keep trying to open dialogue with Juma.
hold your position till you're told otherwise.
I will keep this feed open.
general Juma has demonstrated "that even a tyrant state like the U. S...
be ready.
Jack, listen to me.
Juma's not solely coordinating this attack.
what do you mean?
I heard him talking on his sat phone.
he's coordinating with someone on the outside. They were giving him real-time intel.
you think it's someone in the white house?
I don't know.
but even if we take Juma down, the president may still be in danger.
you're the only one I know who can do this, Jack.
find out who Juma's working with.
agent Moss, a device has been detonated in the west wing.
Mr. Vice president, there's been an explosion at the white house.
an explosion? - Yes, sir.
the president's internet feed has gone dark.
we saw that. What's happening?
I don't know, sir, but we're going in under my authority. Let's go.
that is not your decision. - All teams, attack plan delta.
agent Moss, you're under orders! Agent Moss!
code green.
go, go, go, go!
Pierce, get to the president!
madam president, are you okay?
we need get out of here right now. Both of you, me with me. Let's go. This way.
madam president, get down.
stay low till I know we're clear.
kill the hostages. The president is mine!
no, no, no, no!
don't move! Don't you move!
clear. We're clear!
secret service! I've the president!
aaron Pierce, secret service. Let's go, ma'am.
madam president, this way!
we have the president. The president is secure!
repeat: We have the president. This way, ma'am.
Renee! We gotta get the president out of here now! This way, ma'am.
it's all right, darling. It's gonna be all right.
madam president...
we're still sweeping the west wing.
but we do believe all the hostiles have been accounted for.
now you and your daughter will stay here until we finish securing the building.
I understand.
now once we get the all clear, we're going to move you to andrews air force base.
no, I'm staying right here.
ma'am, it's for your own safety.
do what's necessary to make surethis building's safe because I'm not going anywhere.
the American people need to know that the president is in the white house.
Yes, madam president.
how many people did we lose?
it's too early to tell.
medical teams are on their way to treat the wounded.
we're going to set up a triage unit in the east wing.
all right.
I'd like to speak to the vice president as soon as possible.
Yes, ma'am.
and I need to know how my husband's doing.
would you please contact Dr. Lee Schulman at west arlington hospital?
Yes, madam president. - Thank you.
how's agent Pierce?
they said he's gonna be okay.
what about you?
I'm not sure.
I still can't believe this happened.
I thought they were gonna kill all of us.
I was so scared.
it's over... and we're safe...
thanks to a lot of brave people.
excuse me, madam president, the vice president is on a secure line.
I'll be right there.
did you mean what you said about putting the past behind us?
of course I meant it.
I don't ever want to lose you again.
you won't.
the president's safe, Jack. She's in the residence. She's secure.
m so sorry, Jack.
I know that he wasour friend.
it was supposed to be me.
I was supposed to set off the explosion so that he could secure the president.
he died protecting his country.
Yeah.
this isn't over yet. Agent Moss...
Juma and his men were not working alone.
what are you talking about?
when I was in the lockdown with the president, bill said he heard juma talking on a sat phone.
said he was getting real-time intel from someone on the ouide.
who? - I don't know.
the point is, I don't think this threat is over, and I don't think the president is safe.
you sure Buchanan heard this right?
and right now the only lead we've got is Ryan Burnett.
he knew about the attack on the white house, and chances are, he's gonna know who juma was talking to.
all right, all right, I'll talk to him.
no, the president already offered him immunity. He turned it down.
he's not gonna tell you anything, but he will talk to me.
why is that, Jack, 'cause you tortured him?
I don't need to touch him. I just need him to think I'm there to finish what I started.
and I promise you he will tell us everything we need to know.
Larry, please, the last thing bill asked for before he died was for me to follow this through.
I owe him that.
look, I give you my word. I will not touch Burnett.
Jack, look, I understand about your friend, I do, but I got standing orders from the president to take you into custody.
I gotta get you back to FBI, but I promise you I'll look into this, all right?
agent Powell, handcuff Mr. Bauer.
take him down to staging area B.
sir, put your hands on top of your head.
if you're gonna tell me he's right about this I don't want to hear it.
Yes, that's the problem. You're not listening to what he's saying.
when are you gonna stop defending this guy?
I'm not defending him, I'm defending a good idea.
I just said I will look into this!
now do your job: Finish locking down the building.
agent Reynolds.
I need to speak with the president. It's urgent.
she's in a secure location. You'll need to go through Ethan Kanin.
where is he? - He just arrived.
he's on his wayto see the president. - Thanks.
the president's in the residence with her daughter.
they've both been checked over and they're in good condition.
thank god.
I want a conference with the secnav and the joint chiefs as soon as possible.
we're routing all white house communications to the residence, and we're setting up a temporary command post.
good.
Mr. Kanin, I need to speak with you.
I'm on my way to see the president.
Yes, I know, sir, but it's extremely urgent. It'll only take a few moments.
all right. What is it, agent Walker?
some new intel has just come to our attention and we need to act on it immediately.
I tried to reach the president, but I couldn't get through.
I'm listening.
sir, the threat to the president may not be over.
we've reason to believe that general juma was not acting alone.
before Bill Buchanan died, he saw general Juma communicating with someone on a sat phone.
at this point, we can confirm that FBI agents entered the white house moments ago, and there were reports of sustained gunfire.
it appears that authorits are now in control of the west wing, and we are expecting word from our fbi source of the status of the hostages.
while there has been no official comment...
so what have we got?
the president's alive.
are you sure?
we've been monitoring interagency servers. Word just went out.
Juma's dead, Taylor survived.
what happened do you think?
we don't know any details yet, but we'll keep monitorg.
well...
you gotta admire the damn bitch.
she doesn't give up easily.
I'm sorry, sir. We, uh, just didn't have enough control over the situation.
Greg, you look tense.
do me a favor.
have a drink, relax.
Juma held up his part of the bargain.
we're getting what we wanted. As far as I'm concerned, everything's still on track.
where are the weapons now?
a shipment should ready for pickup in the next couple of hours.
good. Get Chapman on the phone.
I want to nail down some targets.
sir, the chopper you requested is on its way.
it'll be here in ten minutes. You'll be escorting Mr. Bauer back to FBI.
hold him in the command center. - Yes, sir.
this is Larry Moss. - This is Ethan Kanin.
I understand you're taking Jack Bauer back to FBI?
Yes, sir. He's gonna be debriefed and remanded into federal custody.
I want you to put that on hold. - Sir?
I just spoke with agent walker.
she told me juma may have been working with someone on the outside, and that there may be an ongoing threat to the president.
Yes, that's true.
I want you to send Jack Bauer to question Rryan Burnett.
agent Moss?
sir, I think that's a mistake.
Yes, agent Walker shared your concerns with me, and I've given this some thought.
if Burnett does know who Juma was working with, Bauer's approval may be our best chance to get that information.
with respect, sir, Bauer almost killed this man.
I was there, agent Moss, but this will be a controlled interrogation.
we're gonna play on Burnett's fears.
Bauer's presence alone should be enough to intimidate him into talking.
sir, Bauer is a ld card.
we have no idea what he'll do when he gets in that room with burnett.
I realize there's a risk.
that's why you're going to do this under my authority and my authority alone.
you're not taking this to the president?
no. If something does go wrong, I want to make sure the president is protected.
with respect, sir, I think you're not telling the president 'cause you know she'd never allow this.
you've made your objections clear, agent Moss.
I'm not going to debate this with U.
I want you to take Bauer to question Burnett. That's a direct order. Do you understand?
I understand.
and I'm counting on you to supervise every second of that interrogation.
I'll expect a full report as soon as you're done.
Yes, sir.
I want to speak personally to the families of everyone we lost tonight, so...
EP me informed as they're notified.
absolutely, madam president.
and the minute Angela Nelson gets here, send her straight up to me.
we need to start working on the speech to the country.
of course, madam president.
Patrick, you have just been through a terrible ordeal.
are you sure you're okay?
I'll be fine.
it helps to focus on work.
I understand.
thank you, Patrick.
thank god you're all right.
how you feeling?
like I just woke up from a nightmare. It was unbelievable, Ethan.
I can't even imagine it. How's Olivia?
she's shaken up, but she's going to be okay.
I'm glad to hear it.
we lost some good people tonight, Ethan.
we're going to need all the help we can get.
I'm thinking about bringing Olivia on as a special advisor.
madam president, I can understand your not wanting to be separated from your daughter after what's happened.
especially after what's happened, we need people who can do theob.
I'm not disputing olivia's competence, but she's also a political liability.
nobody's forgotten what she did during the campaign, leaking damaging personal information about your opponent to the press.
oliva knows what she did was wrong.
she almost cost you the election.
she's changed.
we talked about it, Ethan, and she is accepting full responsibility.
she has learned from her mistakes.
I'm willing to put the past behind us so we can move ahead.
I still think it's a mistake.
I don't care what you think!
I am so sorry, Ethan.
you know I don't mean that.
but I've made up my mind.
I want Olivia to join my administration.
and I want it to come from you.
me?
your offering her this position would be a good way to extend an Olive branch.
I need the two of you to make peace.
all right, madam president.
I'll talk to her.
thank you, Ethan.
I understand agent walker was trying to reach me.
that's right, but I spoke to her.
what did she want?
just some procedural matters, madam president. I took care of it.
Larry, you wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with Ethan Kanin.
look, I didn't want to go behind your back, but you didn't leave me any choice.
I didn't leave you a...
how about you choose to follow orders?
I'm sorry, Larry. - No. I don't think you are.
Larry, I've seen Jack do some terrible things today.
things that I still can't justify.
but he has been right every time. And you know what?
I can't help but think that maybe if we had just stayed out of his way, none of this would have happened.
look, I am sorry that I went behind your back, but I...
I promise you this play with Burnett will go down just the way Jack says.
if you think you're going with Bauer, you are out of your mind.
you may have gotten a white house order, but I'm still running this operation.
I'll take bauer to see Burnett. You're going back to FBI.
I want you to clean out your office and hand in your badge.
I'm suspending you indefinitely.
okay. I know that you're upset, Larry, but this isn't over.
you're going to need me.
what I need are people that I can trust. I thought that was you.
look, you may think you got what you wanted, getting Renee to go behind my back, but Ethan Kanin ordered me to l you question Burnett.
I'm going to be watching you every second you're in there.
you do one thing I don't like, you're finished. You understand me?
understood.
you should leave Renee out of this.
she was just doing what she thought was right.
yeah? Well, she may lose h job over it.
she's the best agent you've got.
she circumvented my authority. I can't just ignore that.
I've known this woman for nine years, and I've never seen her do the kind of things she's done in the last nine hours.
we've narrowed the list down to 12 targets along the eastern seaboard.
they're all within 300 kilometers of the base.
how many people?
10, 000 to 15, 000 in each target zone.
and our kill ratio would be what?
well, we've chosen these areas for maximum population density, so the ratio could be as high as 80%.
let's hope we never have to find out.
get these coordinates down to the boys in tac-ops.
have them start programming them in.
Yes, sir.
we just intercepted a flash memo from the FBI.
Jack Bauer is on his way to kennedy memorial hospital to question Burnett.
Bauer was arrested. How is this possible?
there was an executive order from the white house giving Bauer access to Burnett.
Bauer will finish what he started. Burnett will tell him everything.
no, he won't, sir.
I have already sent somebody to the hospital to deal with Burnett.
he can take care of Bauer at the same time.
who did you send? - Quinn.
Quinn's good. Bauer's good, too.
agent Moss, we've locked down the entire floor.
we equipped Burnett's room with two cameras and audio surveillance.
where is he?
down the hall. It's going to be a moment. Doctor has to revive him.
Why? What happened?
he was given a heavy sedative. He was in pretty bad shape when he got here.
Dr. Wyndam, special agent Larry Moss, Jack Bauer.
I understand you are here to interrogate my patient.
that's right.
well, he's still recovering from his last interrogation, so if you're here to brutalize him again, I won't be party to it.
doctor, your patient was involved in a terrorist attack against the wte house in an effort to kill the president of the united states, and I believe the people he's working with want to try it again, so if you've got a problem...
we won't harm him, doctor.
this will be a controlled interrogation. Please, we need your cooperation.
it's going to take him a couple of minutes to come out of it.
who are you?
I'm a friend. What's your name?
Yeah. - You're recovering from heart surgery?
Yeah.
do you have a wife, Robert?
no. She passed away.
children? Grandchildren? - No.
what abouthis man? Does he have family?
Yeah. Lots of grandkids.
make a hell of a noise when they visit.
how's your arm?
I should be back on my feet in a couple of hours.
and you, ma'am?
Oh, it's nothing a little aspirin won't take care of.
I want to thank you for what you did.
you took a bullet for me. You saved my life.
there is no need to thank me, ma'am.
right, you were just doing your job.
only in this case, it wasn't really your job since you retired four years ago.
Yes, ma'am, that's true.
do you mind if I ask you why?
did it have to do with Martha Logan?
Martha and I were... close.
it must have been hard for you-- what happened to her.
I'd prefer not to talk about it.
I'm sorry.
you don't have to apologize.
I hope you won't be a stranger, agent Pierce.
thank you.
and, uh... it's Aaron.
okay, Aaron. You get some rest.
I'd like to head back to the residence now if that's okay?
Olivia... I was just coming to see you.
I'm glad you're all right.
thank you.
you have a moment to talk?
sure.
the blunt fact of the matter is...
this administration has just suffered some terrle losses, and we need help.
the president and I would like you to consider coming on board as special advisor to the president.
I, uh...
I have to say I'm a little surprised.
surprised? - Oh, that you'd sign off on this.
you mother said she's ready to put the past behind her...
and so am I.
I overstepped my bounds during the campaign, and I was wrong.
I'm glad you see it that way.
but it's not the past that concerns me, Ethan.
it's what's happening right now, and what's been happening ever since my mother took office.
excuse me?
do you think any of this would have happened if my mother had a chief advisor who knew what the hell was going on in her administration?
what are you talking about?
every government was corrupted on every level, and it all happened right under your nose.
even you have to admit, it's an unconscionable failure on your part.
frankly, I'm surprised you haven't tendered your resignation.
you have no right to speak to me that way.
you don't know what you're talking abo.
you don't have the facts.
I intend to get the facts.
I'm going to find out exactly who failed my mother, and I am going to make sure that that person never is in a position to do it again.
excuse me.
okay, let's go.
I'll be watching. You lay one finger on him, it's over.
right.
he's coming around. - Good.
wake up.
wake up.
remember me?
Oh, my god.
what the hell are you doing here?
I've just come from the white house.
Juma's attack failed.
he's dead, and so are his men.
a lot of innocent people died today. Good people.
including a friend of mine-- Bill Buchanan. You might have met him.
you stay the hell away from me.
and I want to talk to a lawyer right now.
do you hear me? I want to talk to a lawyer!
somebody get me the hell out of here!
you're not going anywhere. It's just you and me, pal.
did you really think you were going to get away with it?
somebody please, help me!
you're wasting your breath. Th're not coming for you.
please don't hurt me. I'll tell you anything you want.
do you hear that-- I'm ready to talk. I'll tell you anything you want to know!
just get him out of here! I'm ready to talk!
they're done talking to you. That's why they sent me.
please, you can't do this! You have no right! This isn't legal!
what happened? - I don't know.
looks like we lost the sound feed. Give me a second.
there are no laws in here, Mr. Burnett.
you aided and abetd terrorists, who then tried to kill the president of the united states.
now you have to answer for that.
the rules don't apply to you anymore.
no, please, please, you can't let him touch me!
please, you can't let him do this... - Shut up!
it could be a glitch in the trunk line.
damn it, fix the thing!
I'm trying, sir.
Bauer? - He jammed the electronic bolt.
is there another way in? - No.
damn it, Bauer, open the door!
have security lock down the hospital.
I want a high-priority apb issued for Jack Bauer.
all agencies.
it's de. - Good. Thank you.
it's done. Burnett's dead.
and Bauer?
They'lthink he killed burnett.
so, nobody will know that we were involved.
good. - Yeah.
now 're having some fun.
agent Moss.
Larry, it's Jack. Listen to me.
where are you?
I didn't kill Burnett. I'm being set up.
set up?
a man released some kind of rve agent into the room.
it immobilized me. He came through the ceiling and killed Burnett.
I swear to you, I'm not lying. I watched him do it.
get back in here, we'll work this out.
I can't, you know that.
you can if you're innocent.
look, there is a reason why they wanted me framed and didn't kill me.
they're trying to keep you distracted by dealing with m so they n finish what they started.
don't let them get away with this. This threat is not over.
damn it!
Mr. Burnett you are a traitor and a terrorist.
Where's the target? Where's the target?
take Mr. Bauer away. He's under arrest.
ha you learned anything else about the attack?
Renee Walker followed a lead on her own.
got a visual on a heavily armed commando unit lead by Juma himself.
bill Buchanan.
Renee Walker says the target is the white house.
condition red. Secure the president.
there's no safe path out.
weeed to secure her in the first floor lockdown.
hostage rescue team are moving into place.
they'll be prepared to storm the building as soon as the order's given.
Mr. Vice president, terrorists are in control of the white house.
until you can provide me more intel on what's going on in there, you are instructed to refrain from launching any action.
president taylor is locked in the safe room.
what is it I can do for you?
I need you to find me another way in.
well, I'm looking at the white house manifest, and according to ts, Olivia Taylor is presently in the building with you.
you find Olivia Taylor, and you'll get the president to open that door.
president Taylor... - God, no.
if you don't open the door, I'm ing to cut out your daughter's eyes one by one.
open the door. - Madam president...
no, open the door. Open the door! - I can't do that. I can't!
do you have children, Jack?
I have a daughter.
could you do what you're asking me to do? Just stand by and watch her butchered?
no, ma'am, but I am not the present the united states.
well, I am the president, and I am ordering you to open that door.
all right, general, you've got me now.
There'no reason to hold anyone else. Let them go.
now, whawe do know is that the president was in the building when the attack took place, and she may have been taken hostage along with numerous other white house personnel.
vice president Hayworth was not in the building, and we're told he was moved to a secure location.
the FBI has cordoned off a nine-block perimeter... - Mr. Vice president, that was agent Moss.
what does he have to say?
he's still requesting that you authorize a rescue operation.
does he have any more intel about what the hell's going on in there?
no, sir.
he deployed two units with deep-band parabolics, but all they were able to get w static.
