doing the offering. Such a spiritual girl.
sorry. Sorry.
what's up, guys? - Look how cute these kids are.
Ping! - Hey!
you son of a bitch! Ping!
Oh, you guys had a good time I see.
we had a great time. - That was so fun.
always a good time at Senwun during the Ghost Festival.
very popular with young people from America.
ping, I got you something.
this one's for you.
this one is for me. We got the same shirt.
gui yue.
gui yue. - Gui yue?
symbol of the month of ghosts. Thank you, Mr. Yul.
is that your size, man? I thought you were a large.
Oh yes yes yes, large. Perfect size. Perfect for me.
Hey, we could be brothers. - Brother?
like wearing-the-same- shirt brothers.
brother! - You're retarded.
Ev-- every time I wear the shirt,
I'll always think of you.
you know? It's like a
a spiritual connection.
2 souls on opposite sides of the earth.
you know? - Yeah yeah.
like, dude, we could pick a day of the month that we both wear it.
Ping. Here, this is for you.
Mel-- - What is this?
it's not quite as spiritual as the ghost shirt, - but I want you to have it. - I cannot accept it.
Yes, you have to. - This is expensive wine.
I don't care, you've been the best tour guide.
we love you so much and we want you to have it.
thank you, Miss Melissa. Thank you.
you're welcome.
you both have been delightful clients.
we're so delightful, aren't we?
but that shirt is kickin' though, right, Ping?
I mean, that-- that's hot.
very much kicking. Number one kicking.
what are you talking about?
that bottle... was for us.
I wanted to give it to him. Plus, you've had enough booze, okay?
no, just a little. - I'm nervous to meet your family.
I don't want-- - Hey, Nai Nai's gonna love you.
what about the rest of your family?
I don't know about the rest of the family.
you know, I got some aunts and they gonna hate your whitey ass for sure.
great.
would you like a little quick one - before we get to Nai Nai's? - Really?
are you crazy? - Crazy for love.
get off me.
we don't usually drink this much.
we've just been planning this wedding and having it and then finally it's time to just relax.
it's your honeymoon. Both of you are celebrating your new life together.
sorry if we're obnoxious.
don't apologize.
so do you think we're still delightful, Ping?
of course, Miss Melissa.
still delightful.
how much longer do you think?
hour, maybe longer.
the roads in this part of the country is very tricky.
it's so weird because it seems so-- so isolated and, what, there's like a billion people running around?
this is a big country.
many farms to feed all the people.
so do people really believe that stuff?
what?
the hungry ghost legend.
it's a very old celebration, but mostly for fun now.
but somebody must believe it.
I mean, they wouldn't spend so much time on the offerings if they didn't think it was true.
you're right.
some people do believe it's real.
do you believe in it, Ping?
are we there?
no, we're not at Anxian.
are you serious? Why not?
I must admit I'm a bit lost at this time, Miss Melissa.
it's not like me at all.
but it's so dark. And like I said before, the road is very tricky.
this map is useless! No use.
don't worry.
it's-- I would be so lost out here.
I understand.
I'm thinking...
go down there and ask for directions.
is it okay?
Yeah. - Just wait here and I'll be back very soon.
miss Melissa.
he's a good husband to you.
and you're a good wife to him.
Thanks, Ping.
you're welcome.
Yul.
Yul.
fuck.
Yul! Yul!
honey, Ping's been gone for an hour. - We there yet?
no. I just went out to take a pee and there's like this weird gonging noise outside.
God, my head is pounding.
do you hear that?
what should we do?
what the hell is that?
you said he went in there an hour ago? - Yeah.
he left like an hour ago.
all right. Hang on, hang on.
Oh God.
what are you doing?
let's go. - Go where?
find Ping.
are you serious? - Yeah, come on.
you all right? - Yeah.
looks deserted.
it does.
Ping!
this is definitely weird.
where do you think he went? - I don't know.
Hello?
Wei! - Ping!
Ping!
windows are boarded up.
someone's been here.
this is fresh. I mean...
where is everybody? - I don't know.
Oh God. Ping!
Ping! Oh no.
what are they doing with these animals?
look at the pigs.
this is weird.
look at the goat.
Hey. It's the gong. - Oh yeah.
who the hell is that?
Hello?
tell him he left an hour ago and we need to find him.
Ping! - What are they saying, Yul?
do you know?
do they want us to leave? - I don't know.
please, can you help us find Ping?
I don't know.
they keep saying the same thing. - Okay. All right.
Yul, let's go.
I don't want to stay here.
all right, come on. Let's go. Come on, Yul.
all right.
these people are crazy. - I know, I know.
Oh my God. Oh my God, Yul.
what the fuck is this?
Oh my God.
be careful. - What is this shit?
dude, what the hell, man? Who
this is disgusting.
crazy motherfucker, what the hell?! - Be quiet, Yul!
some fucking punks.
Oh good, the key's here. - Teenagers or something.
let's go, get in the car. - What about Ping?
honey, get in the car. - What, you just want to leave Ping here?
Yes, we leave Ping here. Come on. Get in.
come on.
fuck. God damn. What is this, goat blood?
Jesus. - Come on, work.
Mel, there's not gonna be coverage out here.
can I at least try? - Just tell me what he said.
I already told you what he said.
he said that he was sorry and that he was going to look for directions.
okay. - Where do you think he went?
I don't know. Maybe I pissed him off with the t-shirt stuff.
Yeah, the t-shirt was stupid.
well, thank God he left the keys, man.
shit, I mean hopefully we can find our way back to Senwun.
how are we gonna do that? I don't know where we are.
and you were fucking sleeping the whole time.
okay, are you gonna get mad at me for sleeping?
Yes, I am gonna get mad, 'cause you know what?
you should've been paying more attention to where we're going.
are you serious, Mel? - I don't know where the fuck we are, okay?
Mel. - And this phone is not working.
and it's freaking me out, all right? - All right, Mel, hey.
so we need to find a phone somewhere. - Okay.
we'll go back the way we came and we'll-- we'll get to a place with cell phone coverage.
and then we can call my cousin.
everything's gonna be fine.
what the hell happened back there?
people out here in the countryside are just more
fuckin' nuts.
old fashioned. You're not supposed to leave your house after dark.
so those animals outside were live offerings for the spirits?
kind of like at the festival but live offerings?
Yeah. You want to kick it up a few notches out here with goats and dogs and shit.
but the idea is the same. You leave an offering for the dead and they won't come inside your house and fuck with you.
what were they yelling at us?
I don't know.
your mom's right. Your Cantonese is shitty as hell.
I think it was an invitation.
an invitation?
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
Yul-- - I know. I know.
5 more minutes, then we'll turn around.
5 minutes.
what do you expect, Howard Stern?
tower must be close by.
Yeah. Let me listen.
what's he saying?
I don't know. I can only make out a couple words.
my Cantonese is shitty, remember?
what is it? What is he saying?
old and new...
come together...
make offerings.
protection...
blood...
sacrifice...
Oh my God.
what was that?
Yul?
I think it was a man.
a man?
looked like an animal or something.
it was a man-- a naked man.
Oh, no... Come on, come on.
come on, come on, come on.
just ease up on the gas a little bit.
come on! Fuck! - Just try the reverse thing.
all right, stop. Stop.
let me try. Let me try.
let's switch. - Okay okay.
all right, baby, just go easy on it, okay? Give it a little bit of gas.
honey, I know what I'm doing. I've lived in DC my entire life, okay?
shit.
go! Shit!
we're stuck. - Don't say that. Don't say that, Mel.
come on. - Get out and push.
you have to. - What?
get out and push right now. - What about the naked dude?
do you want me to get out and push?
fine, I'll get out and push.
No! Don't get out! Don't-- Mel-- don't
then get out. Just do it. Don't think about it.
just get out, Yul.
you're doing good. Please, more more.
I don't have any more.
push harder, Yul!
you did it! Get in! Go!
get in! Get in! Hurry, Yul!
just go. Just go. Go!
Jesus. Jesus.
did you hear that? What was it? - Yeah.
what was that noise? - It sounded like an animal.
what? - It sounded like a pig being slaughtered.
Yeah, okay. Right.
I mean, who the hell slaughters a pig in the middle of the night, huh?
we're in China, Yul.
Yeah. Yeah. I know we're in China, Mel.
but this isn't just
this isn't just China-weird, okay?
it's fucking just weird-weird.
Yeah, I know.
what, that's all you're gonna say?
what do you want me to say?
anything. - Like what?
just something. - Like what?
you got something to say, just say it.
what do you want me to fucking say?!
I should be swimming with the dolphins right now!
what? - But no, we're in fucking China because you wanted to come here!
Yes, I wanted to come here. - This is all your fucking fault!
it's my fault? - Yes, I hate you right now!
it's my fault?! - Yes, it's your fucking fault!
why, because I'm Chinese? - Yes!
Oh shit.
this place is so weird.
Oh my God. Should we check on him?
just drive away. - You want me to drive away?
Yeah. Reverse and let's go back.
but what about this guy?
who cares about that? Let's just go.
let's go. You don't want to be in this country, right?
Oh my God, he's moving. He's moving.
Mel, please. - I think we need to go see him.
Mel, don't do it. - Yul, I've got to go.
don't do anything stupid, Mel! - I've got to go see him.
Mel. Don't.
Mel. - Hi.
Hi. - Help me.
are you okay?
Oh God.
they are coming.
what's he saying, Yul?
what's he saying? - We have to go.
what's he saying?
we've got to go. - They are here.
I think we have to go.
be careful with him. - We have to go, Mel. We gotta go.
let's go. We gotta go. Come on!
we gotta go! Mel!
open the door! Come on, get in there.
do you got him? - Yeah.
get in! - Come on, get in the seat.
Oh my God!
go!
turn us around. - The road's too narrow.
you're gonna run us off the road! - Shit!
get us back on the road.
I'm trying.
slow down a little bit! - We'll get stuck!
Oh God.
shit! - I think we hit a ditch.
no shit, we hit a ditch, Yul. - Sorry.
fuck. - Fuck!
go, go, go...
no, no, no.
it's stuck. - No it's not.
God! - Slow down, honey.
slow down, slow down, slow down.
what were those things?
what's he saying?
moon demons.
they're going to follow this path through the field and find us.
I think we should get the fuck out of this car.
we follow him.
Oh God.
let us in.
open the door, please.
I beg of you.
please show mercy on us.
I'm not from around here.
I don't know what's going on.
she is American.
she's not part of this.
please let her in.
please let us in. Please help us.
please, these people are chasing us.
please please please.
they're crazy people. They're gonna kill us. Please.
you need to let us in. You need to help us.
we will pay you anything.
please. Please.
please.
keep your voices down.
stop calling to them.
hurry.
they will see us.
help me move this to the door.
what is he saying?
we need to find something alive to put outside.
alive?
what, like that dog? - Yeah. Yeah.
um, they're gonna come inside and find us unless we put something outside for them to kill.
what the hell are those things, huh?
I don't know.
what are they, part of some cult or something?
I have no idea, Mel.
what do you know, Yul?
apparently nothing.
there has to be something we can do.
Yeah, there's something we can do.
we can find something alive to put outside.
this is rice here. This is rice.
we might get lucky and find a rat or something.
Wei?
I think he found something. Come on.
wei.
where is he?
fuck you!
motherfucker!
stay away.
don't be a coward.
you can save your wife by offering yourself.
you crazy motherfucker. - It's the only way to save her.
why won't you do the honorable thing? - Are you crazy?
okay. All right, let's go, baby.
no. We have to stop. - What?
we've got to stop.
what? - This is killing me.
come on.
come on, we have to go, okay?
we have to get going, okay?
come on. Come on, baby.
how do you feel? How do you feel?
I'm beautiful, aren't I? - You are. We have to go.
Oh, come on.
come on, it's the car.
I want you to lay down.
let's see here.
I need to keep you warm.
Yes!
shit.
wake up, Yul. You can't fall asleep.
Yul?
wake up.
Why? - Come on.
sit up. - Why?
because those things are still out there, okay?
you can't leave me alone out here.
okay, baby, I'm here. - Good.
awake. - Yeah.
please.
Yul?
I love that you're Chinese.
son of a
Oh my God!
don't let them take me.
please.
Oh my God.
what are we gonna do?
there's gotta be something we can use. - For what?
a weapon. Something in the car.
is there anything else?
tire iron-- there's gotta be a tire iron in the trunk.
you're not going outside.
may not have to.
when I was a kid, I was on vacation once.
fuck.
my dad locked the keys in the trunk at a rest stop.
fuck.
I pulled the back seats off and crawled through.
saved the vacation.
I felt like a super hero that day.
Oh good!
fuck.
help me with the light.
come on.
I got it.
good! - I got it. Not much...
Oh shit. -...but it's something.
Yul.

get us out!
fuck! - Get the fuck out!
God damn it!
come on.
come on! Yul! Come on!
Yul.
we're trapped in here.
what are they doing?
they might not like it in here.
what?
we're in a tomb.
fuck.
what is that?
it's a voice
the voice from the radio.
I think it scared them away.
come to us.
what's he saying, Yul?
come to us.
Yul?
we have to go to them.
there is safety here.
you will be safe here.
we are safe here.
come to us. Come to us.
come to us.
we will help you.
we will help you.
you will be safe here.
you are welcome here.
Yul.
Yul.
Yul!
Yul.
is that you? - Yeah, it's me.
what happened?
you shouldn't be nervous about meeting my grandmother, Melissa.
what?
my Nai Nai's gonna love you.
just like my cousins and the rest of the family.
you got nothing to worry about. - Yul.
I love you, Mel. - I love you too, Yul.
I love you so much, but we need to get out of here right
we should have gone to Kauai like you said.
Yul, listen to me! We need to get out of here.
we need to leave, okay? - These ropes are tight, baby.
Yul, push with me right now.
push! - Okay.
come on.
Yul, push!
come on!
come on, don't give up on me.
don't give up on me, Yul!
Mel. - What?
Yul.

what are you doing?!
come on! Take me, you bastards!
take me!

look at me!
No!
No!
Yul!
Yul!
your husband made a great sacrifice tonight.
he gave them his life for yours.
miss Melissa!
stop it! Miss Melissa! Please! Please! Please!
please! Stop it!
stop it! Stop it!
they come to our village in the 7th lunar month on the night of full moon.
they took away one of our living each time.
many years ago...
we have decided we would no longer let them take our own.
so we bring in outsiders for offering.
I'm very sorry.
I'm sorry for you and for your husband.
what did they do to him?
they took him to the place.
they're preparing him for his final journey.
is he still alive?
they have to take them alive.
but he will be one of them by moon fall.
where did they take him?
Hey! Where did they take him!
miss Melissa, you-- you can't go there.
help me.
help me!
just follow the path that leads them here.
the candles will show you the way.
miss Melissa, they will kill you.
no, Yul.
Yul.
Yul.
Oh my God.
baby.
Mel. - Yul.
where are they?
they're all around us.
but they're-- they're like sleeping or something.
they're not moving. - They're not sleeping.
we could get out of here, Yul.
Yul, we have to get out of here.
they're inside my head, Mel.
they're waiting for me to die.
Yul, we have to go.
I'll pull you out of here.
I can't. I've lost too much blood.
you have to be strong.
you have to fight.
we can get out of here, Yul. - They're gonna kill you.
they're gonna wait for me to die.
and then they're gonna come after you.
they already know you're here.
you have to go. - No, I can't.
please. - No.
Yul, please.
you have to get up.
go see my Nai Nai.
she's your family now.
she'll know.
what will she know?
promise me.
Yul.
promise me, Mel.
I promise.
Mel.
what?
go.
go.
miss Melissa!
go that way.
go out that way!
gosh, what an ancient watch
go - Sorry, we're late - It was an emergency
settle down there
sir, they're still writing
hello. Time's up
please, five minutes. We started half an hour late
it was an emergency
he glared at us like we'd asked for both his kidneys
but we continued writing
he continued arranging the answer sheets
done, sir
you're late. I can't accept these
sir, please, sir
sir, do you know who we are?
prime Ministers son? Even then... I will not accept your paper
do you know our names and roll numbers?
no...
who are you?
he doesn't know; Run!
Hey, what's your roll number?
where the hell are their papers?
o Lord, have mercy
today was Results day. Time to make a deal with God
just save my Electronics. I'll offer a coconut
sir Snake, bless my Physics. I promise a pint of milk per day
o Mother Cow, help me pass...have this grass
I vow: No X-rated thoughts of girls in my class...
watch over my results
God of Wealth, I'll offer 100 every month 100 won't bribe even a traffic cop let alone the Almighty
check from the bottom
you are...last
and you?
second last
Rancho?
not there
my heart sank
not 'cause our ranks tanked, but 'cause our friend flunked
there's a mistake. It's not possible. It's injustice
what's Silencer howling about?
he got the second rank
who's first?
move aside
we learned a lesson in Human Behavior...
your friend fails, you feel bad. Your friend tops, you feel worse
we were sad. Two others were sadder
Ranchhoddas Chanchad. Front row. Right of the Director
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat
alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat
Sahili Rao. Third row...
sir, why this seating according to rank?
any problem with that?
Yes, this grading system is like a caste system
A-graders: Masters. C-graders: Slaves
it's not nice, sir
you have a better idea?
Yes. Results should not be displayed at all
why publicise someone's flaws?
if your iron count is low, will the doctor prescribe tonic...
or air your report on TV
you see, sir?
so basically, what you are saying is...
I should personally go to each student's room and whisper in his ears...
"you have come first" "You're second"
Oh, I'm so sorry, you have failed
no sir, I mean grades create a divide
I've topped, so I'm next to you
my pals came last, they're in the back corner
at least they're in the corner
more time with you, and they'll be out of the photo
they will neither pass, nor get a job
they'll get jobs, sir. There must be some firm that...
prefers humans to machines
they'll get jobs. I guarantee
you guarantee it?
bet, sir?
Govind - Yes, sir?
even if one of them gets a job in campus interviews...
shave off my moustache
sir!
happy? - Smile, please
happy, sir
Jackass; Honking to hide your tooting
septic tank; Popping pills again?
I didn't do it...Raju?
this is a familiar stink
he's the sole cause for global warming
toss me your wallet; I'll buy pants - Take Chatur's suit instead - Don't touch my suit
Rancho'll recognize you even in underwear - Where's this? - If I could read, would I sell peanuts?
he can't read - But he can speak
wait. Do you know a Ranchhoddas Chanchad?
Yes, he lives there
free as the wind was he
like a soaring kite was he
where did he go...let's find him - Chatur, your pills - Thanks. Where were they?
in the pocket - Hey, my pants!
Karl Marx says to share all resources - Shut up!
take it off - Hey, you'll give people ideas
I want it now
what happened?
Rancho's father
excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?
there he is - Thank you
yes?
sorry. We're looking for Ranchhoddas
I am Ranchhoddas
no, I mean...Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad. That's me
Ranchhoddas, take care, son
I'll be in the Guinness Book for driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear
that too, for the wrong guy
same name, same degree, same photo, but a different guy
what's going on?
how did Silencer get Rancho's address?
good point!
hey Chatur, come here
how dare you open this? I got this from San Francisco
handmade biscuits
specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu
Phunsukh Bangdu? Who's that?
not Bangdu. Wangdu. "W." Phunsukh Wangdu
do you know who that is? He's a great scientist 400 patents. The world wants him
took me a year to get an appointment
once he signs the deal with my company, I'll be huge!
forget Wangdu. How'd you get Rancho's address?
you should be thanking Phunsukh Wangdu
he led me to Rancho, see this
my secretary was here to fix an appointment with Wangdu
she didn't get the appointment. But I found Rancho
I checked the Shimla directory and found Rancho's name
what happened to his face?
plastic surgery in honor of your visit?
only one man has the answer
sorry Papa, I couldn't fulfill your last wish
you kept asking me to take you on pilgrimage
but I waited for the highway tender
there the tender opened, here you closed your eyes
I am so sorry, Papa. I could not be a good son...
wrong
you're an engineer. Your degree's on the wall
you were a very good son
how dare you barge in? I'll have you arrested
no, you'll be arrested. We've made enquiries
you use the degree to clinch contracts
it's our friend's degree. How did you get it?
this is a 150 acre estate
if I shoot and bury you, no one would even notice
get the point?
now get lost
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the sacred river. Can take yours too
grab Papa!
here, here
let go of Papa
tell the truth or Papa is flushed - Hand over Papa - Papa goes to the sacred sewer - Get Papa out of the potty - You pull trigger, I pull flush
I'll count to three
wanna shoot us? Raju, scatter the ashes
one
take us down, and Papa's down the drain
two
then grope for him in the gutter
what is it, Raju?
we've got the wrong urn. It's empty
empty?
empty? - We'll empty it out - No, no - We'll empty it out
we'll empty it out
No...hands up!
who are you?
I am Rancho
I swear on Papa, it's true
I am Rancho; That was Chhote
he was our gardener's son, Chhote
he stayed on with us after he was orphaned
did odd jobs around the house, ran errands
he had a passion for learning
he'd wear my old uniform and slip into school
and attend any class he liked. It suited me
I made him do my homework, take my exams
it was going well, till one day...
our teacher saw a sixth grader doing tenth grade math
which grade are you in, son?
what's your name?
we got caught
Papa was a powerful man so our teacher alerted him before going to the Principal
you started it, you will finish it
people pretend to show me respect
but behind my back...
mock me as an illiterate
I won't let that happen to my son
this boy wants to study. I want just a degree
let the game go on
make this kid an engineer and I'll have a degree in my son's name on that wall
I went to London for four years, he went to college as me
he'd promised to cut contact with all after getting the degree
but he always said, "Two idiots will come looking for me"
he really misses you both
I'll give you his address, go to him
but please keep my secret
what secret?
you got the wrong urn, sir. Papa is in here
what the hell's going on? Who was that gun guy?
Ladakh! Why?
to meet Rancho
what's he doing in Ladakh?
no clue. We have the address of a school
school teacher!
I'm Vice President of Rockledge Corporation, and he...
a for Apple, B for Ball...
d for Donkey
next week I sign a huge deal with Phunsukh Wangdu
and he...A for Apple, B for Ball
today my respect for that idiot shot up
most of us went to college just for a degree
no degree meant no plum job, no pretty wife...
no credit card, no social status
none of this mattered to him
he was in college for the joy of learning
he never cared if he was first or last
who was the first man on the Moon?
Neil Armstrong, sir
obviously, it is Neil Armstrong. We all know it
who was the second?
don't waste your time. It's not important
nobody remembers the man who ever came second
soon, 26 companies will be here with job offers
you'll have a job even before your final exam
this is your last lap, my friends
put the pedal to the metal. Step on the gas
go out there and make history!
any questions?
yes?
sir, suppose a student gets a job...
but narrowly fails the final exam, will he still have the job?
very good question
anyone else with the same question?
as expected
please come on stage. Give them a big hand
for the last four years they've been our most consistent students
consistently last in every exam
come my geniuses, come
their brains will fetch a handsome price 'Cause they're completely unused
and to answer their question...
the exam won't affect their jobs
because no company will hire them anyway!
they're so unique, their names will be writ in gold...
Farhanitrate and Prerajulization
give them a big hand, please, everybody
he screwed us in front of everyone
God, I'll give up meat, light a 1000 incense sticks
do me just one favor...delete Virus!
burn him in hell
fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil
you think God is a contract killer?
you shut up
you're in the center of the photo every year; We're rotting in the corner
this year we may fall out of the photo altogether - Know why I come first? - Why?
because I love machines
engineering is my passion
know your passion?
that's my bag - Be quiet
What're you up to?
this...Is your passion
go post this letter
what letter?
5 years ago he wrote this for his favorite wildlife photographer
he wanted to train with him in Hungary
but in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer, never posted it
quit Engineering, marry Photography
follow your talent
if Michael Jackson's dad forced him to be a boxer...
and Mohammad Ali's dad pushed him to be a singer...
imagine the disaster
do you get it?
idiot; Loves Photography, but is marrying machines
your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas
engineering is my wife and mistress both - But I still fail. Why? - Explain 'Cause you're a coward, scared of the future
look at this - more holy rings than fingers
one ring per fear - exam, sister's dowry, job
with such fear of tomorrow, how'll you live today?
how'll you focus on studies?
strange buddies; One lives in fear, the other in pretense
you live in both - fear and pretense
you're scared to tell Pia you love her... so you pretend you don't
what rubbish!
easy to offer free advice, tough to follow it
have the guts? Go confess to Pia - There's no connection - Deep connection, Your Holiness
listen, if you confess to Pia
I'll tell Dad - No Engineering, I'm marrying Photography
and I'll dump my rings before the job interview
deal?
have the guts? - His Holiness is speechless
let's go - Follow me - Where?
let's go
hey Virus; I'm anti-Virus
hope no dog here
cowards! Let's go
if any danger, I'll give the Virus alert
beware - Virus inside
need background score?
Pia - Who's it?
don't yell! It's me, Rancho
just listen for a moment, then I'm gone
say not a word...
Pia - Yes?
those 22 minutes with you on the scooter were the most enchanting 22 minutes of my life
I could spend an eternity with you on the scooter ...and time stands still
every night you ride into my dreams on your scooter, dressed as a bride
instead of a veil, you lift your helmet and come close to kiss me
but that kiss doesn't happen
Why?
because the noses collide, and I wake up
the noses never collide, stupid!
I'm sorry, I thought you were Pia
I wish I was
sister, why did you interrupt?
it took him four years to say this
Pia, kiss him. Show that noses don't collide
you have my permission, kiss him... He's so cute!
who's this? - My sister
who're you?
when you were talking, he kicked. First time
he? How do you know it's a "he" or "she"?
Papa asked the astrologer if we'd get an engineer or a doctor
Meaning?
boy becomes an engineer, girl a doctor
champ, better stay inside. Out here's a circus
your grandpa is the ringmaster. He'll crack his whip "Run! Life is a race. Be an engineer
but you follow your heart. If grandpa scares you...
put your hand on your heart and say, "Aal izz well"
he kicked
say it again
kicked again - Once more - Aal izz Well
who is it?
go
you sent hate-mail to Dad, here's pee-mail for you
enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading - Who is it? - Your future son-in-law
and the wedding party
security, that way
so you all have already learned about the simple pendulum
now let's get down to the advanced study about compound pendulum
it's an irregular object oscillating about its own axis
let me demonstrate to you - What's this? - Pencil - What's inside? - Lead
good. Lead is the axis to this pencil
even you can be a compound pendulum, if you oscillate about...
where is Raju Rastogi? - Present, sir
Hi. Everybody is here
good morning, sir
where were you last night?
studying all night, sir - Studying?
Really?
hasn't slept two nights, that's why he looks scruffy - Not slept?
what did you study?
induction motor, sir. The whole chapter - Whole chapter?
in that case, Mr. Raju Rastogi... - Yes sir!
can you tell us how an induction motor starts?
stop it
sir, rum
Mr. Rastogi; Let's have a cup of tea in my office
sir?
close the door
can you type?
Yes, sir
will you type a letter for me?
definitely, sir
come, sit
sir, I'm sorry sir...
please type
dear Sir...
it is my painful duty to inform you...
that your son is rusticated...
no, sorry, delete that. Go back
your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi...
is rusticated from the Imperial College of Engineering
come on, type
it'll kill my dad, sir - Please type - Sir, please sir
my decision is final and irrevocable
he lives just to see me become an engineer
should've thought of that before peeing on my door
sir, give me one chance...please
OK, remove your name from the letter...
and put in Rancho's
I know he was with you last night
be my witness and I'll spare you
you have 7. 5 minutes to think
we won't let go of you
we're not done yet...no way
the heavens may beckon you
but we'll take up arms against God
and it's not a fight we intend to lose
you may try your best to escape
try with all your might
but there is no way we are letting go of you
we won't let go of you
we're not done yet...no way
Rancho, watch that monitor
his body is paralyzed with shock, but his mind is alert
he can see and hear us. Please don't cry in front of him
speak to him normally, motivate him, joke around
good news, Raju. Your dad's recovered
the new medicine worked
is this your family tradition...
as one male gets up, the other conks out?
come, wake up
your dad wants Pia's scooter
should I give it to him? Hope he won't dent it
raju, Farhan is live on webcam. From the hostel
look, Virus has canceled your suspension order
problem solved...Wake up now
everything's resolved; You hear that?
rise and shine, buddy
in this journey of few strides
on the path called life
don't quit...just celebrate the ride
listen please to those who love you
every dark night is followed by sunrise
don't shut out those who love you
we won't let go of you
we're not done yet...no way
we won't let go of you
we're not done yet...no way - Look, mom bought a new saree - Brand new
it cost 2000
wake up now
she bought not one, but ten sarees
look!
hey Raju
C'mon tell me...How do I look?
remember the letters mom would write...
always blessed you with eternal life
don't die on her...you can't die
look at us now, don't turn away
smile once to show you care
wake up, don't torment us anymore
did you hear about your sister?
she's getting married
without any dowry
the bridegroom wants nothing at all
he just wants Kammo
you know who the bridegroom is?
guess
you know him very well
he loves animals - He's going to be a wildlife photographer - Quiet...Shhhh...
didn't get it? It's our Farhan
Farhan will never take any dowry
Farhan will marry your sister
for free; Free! Free!
one kilo okra, 500 grams cheese for "free" would've woken him
why sacrifice me...
well done, buddy
so it's all fixed; Farhan will marry your sister
Rascals...stop fibbing
lucky escape
we won't let go of you
we're not done yet...no way
we won't let go of you
we're not done yet...no way
we won't let go of you
we're not done yet...no way --Okra Rs. 12 per kilo
we're not done yet...no way
you called for a taxi?
I did - It's waiting
thank you. Why?
I'm going to the job interview
you coming with me?
no. I'm going for the interview. You're going home
why would I go home?
remember, we promised this rascal
give me your tie
Why?
I doubt you'll go for the interview after reading this
what's that?
a letter
for you, from Hungary
some photographer called Andre Istvan
you posted my letter!
he loved your pictures
the guy wants you to assist him...
in the Brazilian rain forest, for a year
will pay you, too
dad will never agree
go speak to him...from your heart
for once, dump your fears...
or someday, on your deathbed, you'll regret it
you'll remember that the letter was in your hand, taxi at the gate...
with just a little courage, you could've turned your life around
do you think he'll like it?
why such an expensive gift?
our son's getting his first job today
don't be stingy at such a proud moment
Farhan; Don't you have the job interview today?
I didn't go
I don't want to be an engineer, Dad
what happened? You had an accident?
see that building? I jumped from its third floor
Why?
because I was rusticated from college
Why?
drunk, I urinated on the Director's door
that scoundrel Rancho is messing with your mind!
I don't enjoy Engineering. I'd make a terrible engineer
Rancho has a simple belief. Make your passion your profession
then work will become play
what'll you earn in that jungle?
a small stipend, but I'll learn a lot
five years from now...
when you see your friends buying cars and homes, you'll curse yourself
life as an engineer will bring only frustration. Then I'll curse you
I'd rather curse myself, Dad
the world will laugh!
label you a loser, for quitting in the final year
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate to be at ICE. What'll he think?
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me with an air-conditioner
it wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept in discomfort while I slept well
he didn't take me around the zoo on his shoulders
you did all that, Dad
how you feel, matters to me. Mr. Kapoor makes no difference
I don't even know his first name
you think you're the hero of a melodrama?
enough, please...he's upset
God forbid, if he did something crazy like Raju...
then the discussion is over
don't say a word or His Lordship will jump off the roof
no, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide. I promise
the Rancho you detest put this picture in my wallet
told me to see it if a suicidal thought crossed my mind and imagine what'd happen to your smiles when you see my dead body
I want to convince you, Dad but not with a suicide threat
dad, what'll happen if I become a photographer?
I'll earn less
I'll have a smaller house, a smaller car
but I'll be happy
I will be really happy
whatever I do for you will be out of genuine love
I've always listened to you
for once, let me listen to my heart
Please...Dad
dad...
dad, please don't go away...
return this
son, what's the cost of a professional camera?
can the laptop be exchanged for it?
if you need more money, just ask
go live your life, my son
your grades are consistently poor. Reason?
fear
I was a good student since childhood
parents hoped I'd end their poverty
that scared me
here I saw the mad race. You don't count if you're not first
my fear grew
fear is not good for grades, sir
I slipped on more charms and rings
prayed to God for favors. No...begged for favors 16 broken bones gave me two months to think and reflect
finally, sense dawned
today I didn't beg God for this job, just thanked him for this life
if you reject me, no regrets
I'll still do something worthwhile with my life
such frank behavior is not good for our firm
we need someone diplomatic to handle clients; You're too straightforward
but...
if you assure us you'll control this attitude, we may consider you
it took two broken legs to get me up on my feet
wasn't easy to get this attitude
can't change it, sir
you keep your job...I'll keep my attitude
I'm sorry, no offense, sir
wait
I've interviewed countless candidates for 25 years
everyone turns into a yes-man to get the job
where did you spring from, son?
sir?
shall we discuss the salary?
thank you, sir
your Majesty, thou art great
accept this humble offering
you had said, "If he gets a job, shave it off"
what have you done?
I feel naked without my moustache
I've lost my dignity
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi
the job isn't yours until you pass your final exam
and this time, I will set the question paper
dad, that's not fair
everything is fair in Love and War
and this is World War...III
Rastogi, you're dead meat
What're you doing here?
be careful - You've been drinking - Yup, had to down a couple
a couple too many - Needed the guts - For what?
for stealing this - What's this?
the duplicate key to Virus's office
the question paper's in a cover with a red seal
dad has set it, to fail Raju
go get it
are you mad or what...that's cheating
everything's fair in Love and War
tell me something...
do you really feel...
the noses collide while kissing?
wait. Have some dhokla
you Gujaratis are so cute
but why does your food sound so dangerous?
sound like missiles
C'mon "Today Bush dropped two Dhoklas on Iraq"
400 dead, 200 injured
C'mon
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda. But your name...
"Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad"; Yuck
I won't change my last name after marriage
Pia, we can't get married
Why?
is there someone else?
no - Are you gay? - No
then why don't you propose to me?
are you impotent? - No
then prove it
Pia, no
stop, stop - What happened? - We didn't inform Pia
stop here, my bladders are bursting - Shut up! - Are you in touch with her?
No...I have her home number, then call her - I'll stop
hello
no place for urine-expulsion in this country - Hello, is Pia there? - No, she's not - Is she at the hospital? - Why would she be there?
she's getting married today - in Manali
too late! She's married
not yet. It's a six hour drive
if we rush, we'll reach before the vows
what do you say?
it's a no-brainer. Let's turn back
no turning back
straight to Ladakh. We'll meet Rancho and return
I have a Friday meeting with Phunsukh Wangdu
get into the car
if I miss my meeting, the Japanese will get him
they're offering him a first name in the company "Phunsukh and Fujiyashi," profit sharing...
Pia weds Suhas - Thanks for the suit
virus will have a heart attack
at every daughter's wedding, we're there to rock the party
listen, I'll update Pia, you peel off the price tag - Farhan - We found Rancho - For Room 107? - Yes, sir - You've taken ages - Sorry, sir
off, now - Housekeeping, sir - Come in
quick, iron my coat
we found Rancho! Now you can't marry this ass
you're mad, Farhan
don't fool yourself, Pia. You still love Rancho
you're still eating his favorite food
he's incorrigible. Once a price tag, always a price tag
shut up, Farhan. Suhas is a changed man
he doesn't speak of brands and prices anymore
my 150, 000 coat
why do you people eat sauce?
I'll sort it out, sir - How?
our laundry specializes in cleaning mint-stained suits
I'll clean it in a jiffy
get it soon - But it's too late now, Farhan - Pia
let's go, Pia, we're late
Pia, it's me...Raju
don't yell, they'll kill me
where is Suhas?
housekeeping took my coat
Go...send Suhas here
it's rude to leave the ceremony - Yeah, Farhan? - The car's ready
grab her hand and run. Don't move - Sir... - My coat?
you're here...
so who's at the altar? - Altar?
another couple of rounds, and we'll be considered married
I'm already married, Pia. Let's go
it's too late. People will laugh at me
so you'll commit suicide?
people will gossip briefly, then forget
but you...you'll regret on your deathbed that the car was at the gate, Rancho within reach...
but in fear of people, you married this ass
housekeeping?
Pia, minor problem - What?
we don't know if Rancho's married - What?
he won't be married - And if he is?
then we'll drop you back
relax! Handmade biscuit?
what's he doing here?
ignore him - The biscuit's very good
till yesterday, I was a law-abiding citizen
but in the last 24 hours, I'd grounded an aircraft almost assigned Shamaldas's ashes to the sewers, and...
made a bride elope from her own wedding! All for Rancho
but he too would do anything for friends
like stealing the question paper... from the lion's den
envelope with the red seal
he feared that if Raju failed, there'd be another high jump
we were principled thieves, stealing the paper only for Raju
we'd sworn we won't even take a peek
Where's it hidden...
we'll grow old searching; Ask Pia
Pia, your phone - Mr. Papa-To-Be; If you say "Aal izz well," he kicks - He kicked
Pia, your phone --Papa's office
found it! Rancho
Hello?
quick, photocopy this
where was it? Put it back - We're safe! - Where were you?
here - What's this?
a gift
question paper. Virus set it himself, to fail you
strange buddies
first teach you to be upright, then offer a path to shame
no way
if I pass, it'll be on my own steam
if I don't, it's still ok
he'd won us over! I felt like embracing him as family...
but then I controlled my emotions - Damn thief - Sir, please, sir - Rascal - Sorry, sir
wanted to change the system?
you'll pee on my door - Sir, what're you doing?
sorry, sir
you are rusticated!
if all of you aren't out by morning, I'll call the police
I will call the police
rascals
rascals, all of you
how did he get my office key?
I gave him the key, Dad
I wish I'd given this key to my brother... He'd be alive today
stop it, Pia
you think your son fell off a train and died?
shut up, Pia
you decided he'd be an engineer
did you ever ask him what he wanted to be?
you put such pressure on him...
that he chose death over the entrance exam
I don't understand...
dad, you go to your room
Pia, don't do this
he wanted to study Literature, be a writer
but all he wrote was this suicide note
put that away, please
no more cover-ups!
just once...
if you'd said, don't do Engineering if you don't want to just do what your heart is in then he'd be alive today
he didn't commit suicide
you're right, Dad
it wasn't suicide...
it was murder
many city roads are completely submerged
traffic has come to a standstill
dad...
go back, Millimeter. Why're you following us?
Why? Your pop owns the road?
please help, we are desperate here
you can't send an ambulance?
get it from another hospital
the entire city's flooded, sir. We're helpless
Mona, you ok?
Rancho, Pia
Rancho, you can't reach here. Do as I say.
the water bag has burst
disconnected! Mona - Turn on the lights. - Where to?
to the table tennis table - Pia, we're in the common room
raju, turn on the web camera
raju, Where's Mona? Show me
hold on
here, Pia
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you
Pia, I'm dying!
Rancho, even when there were no hospitals or docs babies were delivered
you all will deliver this baby
how dare you? I'll kill you
dad, stay out of this
Farhan, get towels and scissors
millimeter, get clothes clips and hot water
Rancho, cover Mona
Mona, try pushing
push with all your might
stop it! I can't do it
Rancho, check if there's crowning
Crowning...?
get that diagram
Rancho; See if the head is coming out
check quickly
go
go, Rancho, go
no crowning
Mona, please push
she's tired, Pia
wake her! If she won't push, it's a big problem - They need a vacuum cup - Where will they get one?
what's a vacuum cup? How is it used?
I'll show you
if the mother's too fatigued to push, a cup is placed on baby's head
suction makes the cup stick to the head...
and the baby is pulled out - I can make this - How?
with a vacuum cleaner - Vacuum cleaner?
Yes, it's vacuum clearner
that pressure's too high, Rancho - I'll control it - Do you have a vacuum cleaner?
Yes, in my office - Farhan, rush and get it - Here's the key
Mona, push
what happened?
raju, what happened? - The power's gone
how'll the vacuum work now?
Farhan, you get the vacuum, I'll get the power - How?
millimeter, get Virus out
what nonsense is this!
not this Virus. My Virus, the inverter - Get that, quick - Ok
raju, wake up the hostel
get car batteries, wires, and a vacuum gauge
emergency in the common room!
Where's Rancho? - Here, sir
keep the batteries here...and the wires
raju, switch off everything, connect the inverter to the mains
Rancho, vacuum cleaner
Farhan, get your lens cleaner - Blower? - Yeah, get it
Rancho, blower
good. Fix this to the gauge
Rancho, I'm done - All switches off? - Yes - Hit the table and computer switches - Ok
raju, turn on the computer
Farhan, here
Pia, come here quick
love you, Rancho - Farhan, turn it on - Ok - Pia, how much suction? - Not more than 0. 5
Farhan, 0. 5 - Cover it
OK
vacuum cleaner baby! Mother of all deliveries - Farhan, stop - Ok
raju, get on the table
push the baby down, like this
OK
Farhan, turn it on
C'mon, you can do it
C'mon, push
do it for Champ
C'mon, Mona
he's coming out
C'mon, you can do it
yes Mona, push - Farhan, turn it off - Ok, off
two clips, cut the umbilical cord
Farhan, two clips on the cord - Get scissors - Be careful
cut at the center, get a towel
Pia, he's not crying
hey Champ!
Rancho, rub his back - Hey Champ - Come on, Champ
no, nothing
blow air into his mouth
C'mon, Champ
no response
hush Mona, say "Aal izz well"
he kicked
what?
he kicked
say "Aal izz well"
if Virus had said, "My grandson will be an engineer"
I would've broken his jaw
but when he finally spoke, he stunned us
what a kick! Wanna be a footballer?
be what you want to be
wait; I've not finished with you!
first day of college, you'd asked me a question...
why didn't astronauts use a pencil in space?
if a pencil tip breaks it'd float in zero gravity. Get into eyes, nose, instruments...
you were wrong
you cannot be right all the time
you understand?
Yes, sir
this was an important invention
you understand?
Yes, sir
my Director said, "When you find an extraordinary student..."
go, study; Pass your exams and leave
and now, Student of the Year...
sir, one photo
I wanted to capture all these memories and take them home
that day, we hugged, we rejoiced, we cried...
we vowed that we'd meet at least once a year...
who knew then, we were seeing Rancho for the last time
untie him
I'll sue you all in an American court
only Rancho can create a school like this
but where is he?
don't pee here
go away creatures - Don't pee here - I'll smack you
Bingo; He cannot be far
excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?
he's not Ranchhoddas! - Rancho...
Chhote...Dammit, what's his name?
calm down. Come with me
Where's he, Rancho?
Farhan, he's read all your books
raju, he reads your blog everyday. Proudly shares it with the kids
remember your helmet, Pia?
it was stolen...
who are you? How do you know us?
didn't you recognize me? - No
how would you? Millimeter is now Centimeter
not Centimeter, you're Kilometer
how did you get here?
I got a letter with a train ticket inside
it said, "Miss being in school? Catch this train..."I did
that rascal Rancho
where is that idiot?
dorje, you fly it
every night you ride into my dreams on a scooter, dressed as a bride
instead of a veil, you lift your helmet and come close to kiss me
couldn't you tell me before leaving?
no
sorry
did you marry?
what? No - You? - Almost...idiot
so?
so what?
do you love someone?
yes
who?
you
see, the noses don't collide, stupid
that's right
Hi...Farhan
screw your "Hi"
Hey, listen to me... - No, you listen to me
I can explain everything
Hi...Raju
how we hunted for you
didn't have a coin for one phone call?
add a couple from me too - Rascal, scoundrel - Let him go now
on your feet, c'mon
having fun, idiots?
hi Chatur
Ranchhoddas Chanchad. How do you do, Mr. Teacher?
you're a teacher in a village - A for Apple, B for Ball...
our trains left together. But yours traveled in reverse...
from engineer to primary teacher
what's your salary, Chanchad? 5000?
for me that's $100
my son's pocket money is more than your salary - Cut the crap - Crap is what he gave us
wanted to change the education system, change the world
finally what does he change? Kids' diapers
you gonna break his jaw or should I?
just relax
remember I'd said one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?
sign here. Accept - You lost, I won!
declaration of Defeat" Unbelievable, man!
Chatur - Crazy guy
Hey, this is Virus's pen! You pinched it?
forget it, man
this is for winners, not losers
if your school ever needs help, call my assistant for a donation
a for Apple, B for Ball...
he hasn't changed at all!
ignore him - He's full of crap
good news is your name isn't Ranchhoddas Chanchad
imagine, after marriage, I'm Pia Chanchad - Yuck
by the way, what is your real name?
you mean you're a scientist?
you have 400 patents?
I won't change my name after marriage
you mean you're Chatur's Wangdu?
it's you the Japanese are wooing?
I don't like Wangdu
are you a scientist or a teacher?
scientist, but I also teach children
so you are The Phunsukh Wangdu?
Yes, yes - Hey Silencer - Hey Chatur, come back
take that
wait, I'll stop him
Mr. Wangdu, I can't believe it's you
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur
I can't sign the deal with your company
what sir? Why sir?
how do I sign, man? You took my pen
what pen, sir? I didn't get you...
the one in your hand - Virus's pen
Mr. Wangdu...?
Yes, Chatur
a for Apple, B for Ball is... --Phunsukh Wangdu
...S for Screwed
you got me, Rancho - I mean, Mr. Wangdu
totally floored me. Good one

you probably don't speak any other languages beside English.
that doesn't true. I speak Ethiopian !@#$%...& That means, em, armchair.

when I asked out Aaron McGrath.
she called me the dudie head and pulled down my pant during recess.

I can't really blame her.
because I was quite empirically a dudie head.

why is that the the only girl that I can stand being sober with for more than an hour present company excluded happens to be 16?
why can't I look my father in the face?
you're right!
I spent my entire life running away from anything Chinese including my father.

your father's gonna be a little surprised.
I don't give a shit what he thinks.
listen to yourself, man!
you're moving to Shanghai for a girl.
a Chinese girl, for God sakes!
this is not just about the girl.

this is hard to say.
Oh, spill it, bust it, come on!
well, I think that we should stop...
Oh. Sugar salad!
give me those please.
Yeah, sure.
you're the bestest boyfriend...
Yeah, OK Addy you're a great girl, you're beautiful, smart, strong.
and you shouldn't be hanging arround with me.
you should be with the guy at your own age.
I'm gonna be 17 like 2 weeks!
what are you? like 8 years older than me?
12!
big deal!
I look like a dwarf I'm even, almost taller than you.
look, It's not my fault that my a'pophysial plate feels immaturely.
Apo'physial! Apo'physial!
did you drink milk? Yes, I drank milk.
whole 100 percent?
did you drink fat flavor?
what percent milk I drink is not the point.
the point is I can drive and drink alcoholic beverages.
not at the same time.
what's your point?
woody Allen was with a woman 35 years younger than him.
woody has 3 Academy awards.
when I get 3 Academy awards I can date 12-year-olds if I want.
I met some one.
Really?
Yeah.
is it a girl?
no, it's an squirrel, actually.
of course it's a girl.
I don't know, you're barely natural.
it's a Chinese girl, I met her in China.
what can I get for you?
we're gonna take a sugar salad.
you're gone, for like 3 days 3 days!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I don't know what you want me to say.
I feel so shady now!
you don't have to feel shady.
let's go have the sugar salads.
fuck the sugar salad!
fuck her in the sugary ass!
you're dumping me for some Chinese girl?
we were never really together.
Oh, right. I forgot, I'm only 16.
how are you gonna maintain the relationship with some 7-thousands-miles-away?
I'm moving to Shanghai.
what?
I'm moving there.
to Shanghai?
who moves to Shanghai? No one does that.
no one moves to Shanghai.
I don't know, lots of people.
I don't know. It just feels right.
you'll just leave me here to rot?
leave you here to rot?
you live in Beverly Hills for Christ.
I wish I live where you lived.
please just go see this movie, please!
I'm gonna get you a sugar salad.
don't you have any feelings at all?
you have your grandmother died Don't you feel sad about that?
don't you feel sad about anything? You're like a fucking robot.
now you're going to China for some girl you've only known for 2 days.
do you really think that you'll gonna find what you looking for out there?
you need to calm down, I'm going nuts!
wait, just wait!
I like you, Addy, I really do.
it scares me how much I like you.
why you are leaving?
because I feel empty here.
it's like I'm pissing my life away.
l. A. is a cold and desertly place. It really is.
it's like sucking my life right out of me.
maybe it's you Liam Did you ever think of that?
maybe it's you sucking the life outa yourself.
you're just a just a kid. Addy.
go home!
don't go to Shanghai, please.
it'll be a mistake, you know it'll be a mistake.
fell in love, with a girl.
lost my hold on this whole world.
sad to say, it's about truth.
there's nothing more that we could do.
but Love just don't quit!
so hard to see from where we sit.
love just don't quit.
it's not a box there ain't no live.
holidays, time of year.
call them close and hold them near.
some souls comes, some don't show.
round and round and round and goes.
but Love just don't quit!
so hard to see from where we sit.
love just don't quit.
it's not a box there ain't no live.
some years past, in a day.
Somethings's changing something's faint.
some day seems like nothing's new.
you have me and I have you 'Cause Love just don't quit.
hard to see from where we we sit!
love just don't quit.
it's not a box there ain't no live!
give it out and let it end.
excuse me, Mister.
do you speak English?
I need an umbrella.
raining, raining.
the umbrellas right there.
thank you! thank you!
it's good, you should try it.
it's so shiny.
I'm gonna get blinded by it.
no, it's a desert. You'll like it.
let's go to Mc'Donnald. This food is scaring me.
that stuff would kill you faster than poison.
somewhere out there is a bunch of angry feet of chicken.
didn't your mother ever told you not play with your food?
I don't know I have no mother.
everybody has a mother.
you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine, It's just...
I don't really remember her.
I mean I have memories, but...
I don't know which ones are real and which ones I created because I needed them.
we don't have to talk about this.
no, no, it's good to talk about it.
well it was my birthday.
I was 6.
and we were coming home from dinner.
we didn't have much money then.
so going out to eat was special.
so I wanted to order something special.
and after looking over the menu for 30 minutes.
I saw that they have turtle soap.
and I thought, wow. Wouldn't it be cool to go to school on monday,
and tell everyone that I had turtle.
but on the way to the bathroom,
I saw the life turtle in the Kitchen,
and I started crying.
I could never eat such a good animal.
and so I burst into the kitchen like a knight rescuing princess.
I grab the turtle and I burst out.
and after my parents come down the kitchen,
my mom said that I could keep the turtle.
as a birthday present.
so it was sitting on my lap in the car my father was driving.
he may have been drunk.
I'm not sure, but they started arguing in Chinese.
every time they argue in Chinese I know something's wrong.
the rest is a blur. The next thing I know the car is flipped upside down on the side of the road.
there's a shart-of-class jetting from my mother's neck.
bloods dripping down her white blouse.
I never did find out what happened to the turtle.
you wanna go see a movie?
you have movies here, right?
of course.
let me go to the man's room then we can go see a movie.
I can't watch this.
why not?
because the Rock sounds like Richard Simons.
that's why not.
who is Richard Simons?
never mind.
who's the Rock?
I'm gonna get something to drink I'll be right back.
Hi, you reach Addy. She's not here right now to take your call...
I know 'Cause I'm her.
get in the car!
did you say get in the car?
why would I get in the car?
get in the car? OK? OK?
you hit me.
Yes, very good, very smart.
people always complaining about American education system.
what do you want?
where are you from?
here and there, I get around.
where are you from?!
I'm from Los Angeles.
California!
it's beautiful there, isn't it?
it's OK.
beautiful women too.
I've never been myself.
but I watch Hollywood movies.
like, em, Charlie's Angels.
you've seen Charlie's Angels?
it's not one of my favorites.
I found the plot to be lack...
Plot?!
who needs plot when you have crazy American women running around?
right?
there's something doesn't make sense to me.
you see you have Charlie's Angels
and crazy American girls.
yet you still feel the need to come here and steal our women.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about my girlfriend,
Mickey.
lately she's been acting very strange.
always busy.
you know what she's doing everyday?
I have no idea.
who do you think you are?
you American think you can take anything you want?
I don't think that.
you don't think that?
who discovered America? Who discovered America?!
christopher Columbus?
I forget.
that's want you learned in school, right?
but I want to find out.
how he can DISCOVERY a country with already more than 40, 000, 000 native Americans?
where are they now?
they welcomed you with open arms.
and you killed them all.
I guess we have different text book, huh?
look, I'm Chinese.
my parent went to America as Immigrants.
you'll never be Chinese.
you were raised on cheese burgers and pizza.
you may think you have discovered China.
but we have been here for thousands of years.
and I'm not gonna stand around watch you take what's right for me.
Hi, you have a phone that I can use?
telephone I can use?
you have a...
Hi, you have phone?
sir, Do you have a phone?
Hey! Hey!
Ma'm Ma'm.
can I use your phone?
please, please please!
here, look, look!
I give you this.
you let me use that?
OK? Can I use that?
I'll give you money?
look! Look!
I'll give it right back. I'll be right here.
Ma'm, please!
thank you, see, good, happy.
thank you!
Mickey!
I wanted to tell you.
I really did.
but Jai Lee is not the most reasonable man.
he gets violent.
to beat you?
who is this guy?
we're to be married.
that's terrific.
Congratulations!
am I invited to the wedding?
you have to understand.
a bowl of huntuns, please.
Huntuns?
Yes, thank you.
what don't I understand?
do you love him?
it's not about love.
then what?
I used to work as a waitress.
in about a year ago Jai Lee comes in, throwing his money around.
telling me how beautiful I am. And how he wants to take care of me.
so this is all about money.
see, that's why you would never understand.
what don't I understand?
you are what we call a gold digger.
how many siblings do you have?
I don't have any.
I have 5.
3 sisters and 2 brothers.
how much does the average American make?
I don't know.
maybe 35, 000.
I make 1200 a year.
my family, all seven of us
lived in a one bedroom apartment.
my father died years ago,
leaving my mother to raise all of us all by herself.
so no, this is not about love.
I'm with Jai Lee to ensure my family have a better life.
you are gonna stay in a loveless and abusive marriage for the rest of your life?
trust me!
there are worse things.
thank you!
you're hungry.
getting the shit beat out of me,
spending the night in a ditch can be pretty consuming?
but on the up side it did my cardy over the week.
go back to America!
what about you?
I'm be fine.
have you ever seen Sinatra concert?
what about Billy Holiday?
how old do you think I am?
well, my favorite is Nat King Cole.
you listen to Nat King Cole?
my mommy used to play a lot of old records when I was little.
she used to sing to me a lot.
you're still little.
what's wrong?
just miss her, that's all.
just unfair.
I mean how can someone die from lung cancer when they never even smoked.
I know what you mean.
how?
em, I don't know I don't, I guess.
do you talk to you mom a lot?
every night.
Really?
Yeah, right before I go to sleep.
you're a good son!
hey Liam!
Liam?
just sign this And you are all set!
I can't.
OK, this was fun.
call me the next time you want to do this.
Hey, can you help to transfer the deed to someone else?
I can not accept this.
geese Louise If you learn anything in life:
learn that when some one gives you a house,
you don't say I cannot accept this.
you say fuck yeah!
Yeah, try it.
fuck, yeah!
alright, we'll work on that.
no one has ever done anything like this for me before.
all I know is if you marry Jai Lee.
you're gonna regret it!
maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow.
but soon, and for the rest of your life!
Oh, can you do me a favor?
before you kicked me out of your house.
any thing.
can you read one of these letters to me?
of course.
this is from your father.
my Xiaoyin:
I have missed you these past few months.
and I regret that I cannot be with you during this venerable time.
I hope that my mother is taking good care of you!
because she is so exited to become a grandmother.
I am working hard in Suzhou,
to save enough money.
for us to go to America!
I hope to make enough money,
so that we can go before you give birth.
I want our son to be born there.
so he can become the president of the United States one day.
please know, you'll always be with me!
liu Yi.
Wow!
Yeah, I'll say...
Thanks!
thank you!
thank you for everything!
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad?
Hey!
I loved her.
I know.
I'm sorry.
you forgive me?
you look skinny.
I'll take you to lunch.

I have a job now.
I'm paddling Cappuccinos at Starbucks.
my son.
I cannot believe it!
you work for the man,
working for the man.
like kids want to say.
nobody says that dad.
are you sure?
you've been away to long.
a kid down the street, say it all the time.
damn, I miss that taste!
how about this girl?
over there, the blonde.
like a 7. 6,7. 7?
what do you think?
she's OK!
OK?
you don't wanna play anymore?
Jo, did you ever think assigning women to numeric value between 1to10
based on artificial quality is kind of superficial?
Liam, if you don't think she's cute,
just say you don't think she's cute!
you know what I think?
I made a big mistake with Addy.
you can come up with a list of hundreds of qualities that you think are important in another person.
but in the end The heart wants what it wants.
you spend you entire life fighting that.
Oh, my God!
you just you go crazy!
Yeah, I'm sorta gone crazy just listening to you.
sorry.
so, you could ramble on about it with me for the rest of the day.
or, or...
you could call her.
you know what, I'm not gonna call her.
I'm gonna go over there.
I got it, Thanks!
how you're gonna get there?
you've sold your car.
I'll walk, I'll run, I'll fly over there!
catch you later.
nobody walks in L. A.
Hi. Hi!
I made some bad decisions and I'm trying to get them right.
I chopped them where to live in and stored them out of sight.
I've gone reputational running from a fight.
when the situation is out my hands.
sometimes you've got to go to stay!
let the eastest fades for where it may.
drop the masquerade like a life could make.
give it all away.
we had a conversation it was more than what we've sad we had a destination we could see it up ahead.
to my imagination run winds around up my head.
trying not to face that.
slipping away...
sometimes you've got to go to stay.
let the eastest fades for where it may.
drop the masquerade like a life could make.
give it all away.
What're you doing here?
I came to see you.
and I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now.
I wouldn't blame you if you slam the door in my face.
and I deserve it!
I get the door slammed.
who is it, sweetie?
just, Chinese.
great!
go to Paris.
what?
I want you to go to Paris.
I want you to see the world.
I want you to do what you're passionate about.
when I was in Shanghai,
I had a lot of time to think.
nobody spoke English.
and the movies there suck.
but, I realized how badly I treated you.
I mean you have so much heart.
you can sing to the world.
and I always made it seem like you needed me.
you don't, you never did.
I'm the one who needed you.
and I was scared,
scared of you growing up,
scared of you wake up one morning and realizing that you didn't need me,
scared of you going off to Paris seeing the whole world out there without me.
but I'm not scared anymore.
and I love enough to let you go!
you dumped me.
and then you have this epiphany in Shanghai.
and now you're standing here basically giving me permission to live my life?
and by the way, news flash.
I'm already going to Paris.
you are?
next week.
great!
perfect!
that's what I wanted to hear.
you are gonna learn so much.
your are gonna meet so many interesting people.
if you are running into Gerard Depardieu,
tell him that I loved him in Green Card.
why do you make it so hard for me to hate you?
God, I'm starving.
so, do you need some cash, bunny?
I'm gonna found out?
OK.
so where is the food?
I left it at the restaurant.
so, this is goodbye?
more like, see you later!
I'll just...
that was weird.
you read the copy?
Yeah, sure.
just start whenever you're ready.
OK.
right into the camera.
do you have genital herpes?
it's just...
lately...
I've been feeling iching and burning around in my genital area.
and how did this happen to me?
I ask myself.
is that girl in Puerto Rico?
I knew she wasn't a virgin.
but will I ever be able to love again?
will anyone love me?
am I supposed to spend my entire life alone?
because of one drunken night?
this is what I felt
before I tried Provium.
Provium daily suppressive therapy can help reduce the frequency of outbreaks.
make the most out of your life!
ask your doctor if Provium is right for you.
wow, that was amazing!
you know, I really believed you have genital herpes.
do you?
no, I don't.
well I don't think we need to see anyone else.
sorry.
I'll miss you!
go to Paris?! Stupid!
God damn it!
so stupid!
Hey!
either you came to see me or you've ordered a mail-order bridge.
I saw you're with that guy.
he is one of my instructors. And he scales like a pineapple.
you still remember me?
bunny, you are my every other memory.
how do you know I was coming in?
I called your dad.
God, you're like obsessed with me or something.
I'm more than obsessed I'm daffy about you.
daffy like a duck?
daffy like a duck!
quack! Quack!
Oh these are... these are for you.
Thanks!
so you think we have a chance?
anything is possible.
it's the beauty of living.
moonlight is raining down,
and I chose a blazing road,
shining like a pawning tree.
the city close a massive rose,
swinging on a high trapeze,
far above the crowds I see.
all I need is Love.
spinning around the circus grounds,
take me and bring me home again,
I see everything in front of me,
it's love and only love can bring us home.
fires burn from sea to sea,
warming me and I am free.
open doors in front of me,
only time knows where they lead.
everything I'll ever need!
standing there in front of me,
all I see is love.
spinning around the circus grounds,
take me and bring me home again,
I see everything in front of me!
it's love and only love can bring us home.
only love, only love.
love, spinning around the circus grounds.
take me and bring me home again,
I see everything in front of me!
you're late!
I know, I'm sorry It was a lot of traffic.

whenever you're sad and blue.
and you are feeling all alone and left behind
just take a look inside you, and you'll find
you gotta hold on, hold on through the night
hang on, things will be all right
even when it's dark, and not a bit of sparkling
sing-song sunshine from above
spraying rays of sunny love
Hey, that's...
rays of sunny love' is great
but I still don't have my car
well, think of it on the bright side
what side?
you never would have got to meet me so if you use
do you wanna get a cup of coffee with me?
you see if I go home now, that I'm going home alone
and it's a little scary
how old are you?
Why? Is it illegal to share a caffeinated beverage with a minor?
I really shouldn't
I mean, just wouldn't be logical
what if I'm the one?
the wine?
if I am then you'll feel pretty stupid not having a cup of coffee with me
I guess so
I mean I'm not saying I am the one
there's just always the possibility, you know
and isn't that what life's about, possibilities
I really shouldn't.

she gets away with that
she gets away without having anything close enough to resembling a real personality
the bag looks real to me
let me guess
Capricorn?
libra
close enough, you wanna buy me a drink?
what makes think you deserve a drink?
er, because I'm a good person
by Hollywood standards
anyway, by normal standards
I'm a fucking asshole
D'you, you think I'm a good person?
well, I don't even know you
well, the truth is I think you are really cute
and I was compelled to meet you
and normally I wouldn't surcome to my compulsion so easily
but I'm trying to embrace a new philosophy of life
that involves surcoming
and I mean if I have to surcome
I'm glad I'm surcoming on you
hey
think of this drink as...
as an investment for the possibility of mutual growth in this potential relationship
any years from now
when our daughter
jumps to your laps, and asks you
Oh, how did mommy and daddy meet?
you can look at this drink as the best investment you've ever made
but I gotta know if you're really committed to continuing this conversation before I waste my time
I just go, like nothing happens

you probably don't speak any other languages beside English
that doesn't true I speak Ethiopian !@#$%...& That means, em, armchair
well, why don't you speak Chinese?
because I'm an American
you're not an American
your face is Chinese
your hair is Chinese
your eyes are Chinese

you're in analysis?
yeah Ever since the second grade
when I asked out Aaron McGrath
she called me the dudie head and pulled down my pant during recess
that's horrible
I can't really blame her
because I was quite empirically a dudie head
but then I got very self-conscious about my penis size
err, I mean, were small, but I was 7
I think for a 7-year-old
it was decent size, I think
are you nervous?
yeah a little bit
do I intimidate you?
you have no idea
how was that?
I'd say let's go back to my place but I don't know where it is.
let me get this
Hello?
I wrote you a poem, you wanna hear it?
Yeah, sure
I woke up lonely the day I died.
the sun never sang to me so bright
the songs of heaven that dance inside my eyes
watching a seagull's flying
and time stands still
as I paint the penguin red and I turned blue
I thought of you and only you.
in the darkness you'll come
and drive my tears and rescue me
from the plastic cups and empty faces
my Shanghai Kid My One and Only

some years past, in a day
Somethings's changing something's faint
some day seems like nothing's new
you have me and I have you 'Cause Love just don't quit
hard to see from where we we sit
love just don't quit
it's not a box there ain't no live
give it out and let it end
excuse me, Mister
do you speak English?
I need an umbrella
raining, raining
the umbrellas right there
thank you thank you
it's good, you should try it
it's so shiny
I'm gonna get blinded by it
no it's a desert You'll like it
let's go to Mc'Donnald This food is scaring me
that stuff would kill you faster than poison
somewhere out there is a bunch of angry feet of chicken
didn't your mother ever told you not play with your food
I don't know I have no mother
everybody has a mother
you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine, It's just
I don't really remember her
I mean I have memories, but
I don't know which ones are real and which ones I created because I needed them
we don't have to talk about this
no, no, it's good to talk about it
well it was my birthday
I was 6
and we were coming home from dinner
we didn't have much money then
so going out to eat was special
so I wanted to order something special
and after looking over the menu for 30 minutes
I saw that they have turtle soap
and I thought, wow Wouldn't it be cool to go to school on monday
and tell everyone that I had turtle
but on the way to the bathroom
I saw the life turtle in the Kitchen
and I started crying
I could never eat such a good animal
and so I burst into the kitchen like a knight rescuing princess
I grab the turtle and I burst out
and after my parents come down the kitchen
my mom said that I could keep the turtle
as a birthday present
so it was sitting on my lap in the car my father was driving
he may have been drunk
I'm not sure, but they started arguing in Chinese
every time they argue in Chinese I know something's wrong
the rest is a blur The next thing I know the car is flipped upside down on the side of the road
there's a shart-of-class jetting from my mother's neck
bloods dripping down her white blouse
I never did find out what happened to the turtle
you wanna go see a movie
you have movies here, right?
of course
let me go to the man's room then we can go see a movie
I can't watch this
why not?
because the Rock sounds like Richard Simons
that's why not
who is Richard Simons?
never mind
who's the Rock?
I'm gonna get something to drink I'll be right back
Hi, you reach Addy She's not here right now to take your call
I know 'Cause I'm her
get in the car!
did you say get in the car?
why would I get in the car?
get in the car? OK? OK?
you hit me
Yes, very good, very smart
people always complaining about American education system
what do you want?
where are you from?
here and there, I get around
where are you from?!
I'm from Los Angeles
California!
it's beautiful there isn't it
it's OK
beautiful women too
I've never been myself
but I watch Hollywood movies
like, em, Charlie's Angels
you've seen Charlie's Angels?
it's not one of my favorites
I found the plot to be lack...
Plot?!
who needs plot when you have crazy American women running around
right?
there's something doesn't make sense to me
you see you have Charlie's Angels
and crazy American girls
yet you still feel the need to come here and steal our women
I don't know what you're talking about
I'm talking about my girlfriend
Mickey
lately she's been acting very strange
always busy
you know what she's doing everyday
I have no idea
who do you think you are
you American think you can take anything you want?
I don't think that
you don't think that?
who discovered America? Who discovered America?!
christopher Columbus?
I forget
that's want you learned in school, right?
but I want to find out
how he can DISCOVERY a country with already more than 40, 000, 000 native Americans
where are they now?
they welcomed you with open arms
and you killed them all
I guess we have different text book, huh?
look, I'm Chinese
my parent went to America as Immigrants
you'll never be Chinese
you were raised on cheese burgers and pizza
you may think you have discovered China
but we have been here for thousands of years
and I'm not gonna stand around watch you take what's right for me
Hi, you have a phone that I can use?
telephone I can use?

I wanted to tell you
I really did
but Jai Lee is not the most reasonable man
he gets violent
to beat you?
who is this guy?
we're to be married
that's terrific
congratulations
am I invited to the wedding?
you have to understand
a bowl of huntuns please
Huntuns?
Yes, thank you
what don't I understand?
do you love him?
it's not about love
then what?
I used to work as a waitress
in about a year ago Jai Lee comes in, throwing his money around
telling me how beautiful I am And how he wants to take care of me
so this is all about money
see, that's why you would never understand
what don't I understand?
you are what we call a gold digger
how many siblings do you have?
I don't have any
I have 5
3 sisters and 2 brothers
how much does the average American make?
I don't know
maybe 35, 000
I make 1200 a year
my family, all seven of us
lived in a one bedroom apartment
my father died years ago
leaving my mother to raise all of us All by herself
so no, this is not about love
I'm with Jai Lee to ensure my family have a better life
you are gonna stay in a loveless and abusive marriage for the rest of your life?
trust me
there are worse things
thank you
you're hungry
getting the shit beat out of me
spending the night in a ditch can be pretty consuming
but on the up side it did my cardy over the week
go back to America
what about you?
I'm be fine
have you ever seen Sinatra concert?
what about Billy Holiday?
how old do you think I am?
well, my favorite is Nat King Cole
you listen to Nat King Cole?
my mommy used to play a lot of old records when I was little
she used to sing to me alot
you're still little
what's wrong?
just miss her, that's all
just unfair
I mean how can someone die from lung cancer when they never even smoked
I know what you mean
how?
em, I don't know I don't, I guess
do you talk to you mom a lot?
every night
Really?
Yeah, right before I go to sleep
you're a good son
hey Liam
Liam?
just sign this And you are all set!
I can't
OK, this was fun
call me the next time you want to do this
Hey, can you help to transfer the deed to someone else?
I can not accept this
geese Louise If you learn anything in life
learn that when some one gives you a house
you don't say I cannot accept this
you say fuck yeah!
yeah try it
fuck yeah!
alright, we'll work on that
no one has ever done anything like this for me before
all I know is if you marry Jai Lee
you're gonna regret it
maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow
but soon, and for the rest of your life
Oh, can you do me a favor?
before you kicked me out of your house
any thing
can you read one of these letters to me?
of course
this is from your father
my Xiaoyin
I have missed you these past few months
and I regret that I cannot be with you during this venerable time
I hope that my mother is taking good care of you
because she is so exited to become a grandmother
I am working hard in Suzhou
to save enough money
for us to go to America
I hope to make enough money
so that we can go before you give birth
I want our son to be born there
so he can become the president of the United States one day
please know, you'll always be with me
liu Yi
wow
Yeah, I'll say
thanks
thank you
thank you for everything
dad?
dad?
dad?
dad?
hey

I'm sorry
you forgive me?
you look skinny
I'll take you to lunch

I have a job now
I'm paddling Cappuccinos at Starbucks
my son
I cannot believe it
you work for the man
working for the man
like kids want to say
nobody says that dad
are you sure?
you've been away to long
a kid down the street, say it all the time
damn, I miss that taste
how about this girl?
over there, the blonde
like a 7. 6,7. 7?
what do you think?
she's OK
OK?
you don't wanna play anymore?
Jo, did you ever think assigning women to numeric value between 1to10
based on artificial quality is kind of superficial
Liam, if you don't think she's cute
just say you don't think she's cute
you know what I think
I made a big mistake with Addy
you can come up with a list of hundreds of qualities that you think are important in another person
but in the end The heart wants what it wants
you spend you entire life fighting that
Oh my God
you just you go crazy
Yeah, I'm sorta gone crazy just listening to you
sorry
so, you could ramble on about it with me for the rest of the day
or, or
you could call her
you know what, I'm not gonna call her
I'm gonna go over there
I got it Thanks
how you're gonna get there?
you've sold your car
I'll walk, I'll run, I'll fly over there
catch you later
nobody walks in L. A.
hi Hi
I made some bad decisions and I'm trying to get them right
I chopped them where to live in and stored them out of sight
I've gone reputational running from a fight
when the situation is out my hands
sometimes you've got to go to stay
let the eastest fades for where it may
drop the masquerade like a life could make
give it all away
we had a conversation it was more than what we've sad we had a destination we could see it up ahead
to my imagination run winds around up my head
trying not to face that
slipping away
sometimes you've got to go to stay
let the eastest fades for where it may
drop the masquerade like a life could make
give it all away
What're you doing here?
I came to see you
and I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now
I wouldn't blame you if you slam the door in my face
and I deserve it
I get the door slammed
who is it, sweetie?
just, Chinese
great
go to Paris
what
I want you to go to Paris
I want you to see the world
I want you to do what you're passionate about
when I was in Shanghai
I had a lot of time to think
nobody spoke English
and the movies there suck
but, I realized how badly I treated you.
I mean you have so much heart
you can sing to the world
and I always made it seem like you needed me.
you don't, you never did
I'm the one who needed you.
and I was scared
scared of you growing up
scared of you wake up one morning and realizing that you didn't need me
scared of you going off to Paris seeing the whole world out there without me.
but I'm not scared anymore.
and I love enough to let you go
you dumped me
and then you have this epiphany in Shanghai
and now you're standing here basically giving me permission to live my life?
and by the way, news flash
I'm already going to Paris
you are?
next week
great
perfect
that's what I wanted to hear.
you are gonna learn so much
your are gonna meet so many interesting people
if you are running into Gerard Depardieu
tell him that I loved him in Green Card
why do you make it so hard for me to hate you?
God, I'm starving
so, do you need some cash, bunny?
I'm gonna found out?
OK
so where is the food?
I left it at the restaurant
so, this is goodbye?
more like, see you later
I'll just...
that was weird
you read the copy?
Yeah, sure
just start whenever you're ready
OK
right into the camera
do you have genital herpes?
it's just...
lately...
I've been feeling iching and burning around in my genital area
and how did this happen to me
I ask myself
is that girl in Puerto Rico?
I knew she wasn't a virgin.
but will I ever be able to love again?
will anyone love me?
am I supposed to spend my entire life alone?
because of one drunken night?
this is what I felt
before I tried Provium
Provium daily suppressive therapy can help reduce the frequency of outbreaks
make the most out of your life
ask your doctor if Provium is right for you.
wow, that was amazing
you know, I really believed you have genital herpes
do you?
no, I don't
well I don't think we need to see anyone else
sorry
I'll miss you!
go to Paris?! Stupid!
God damn it
so stupid
hey
either you came to see me or you've ordered a mail-order bridge
I saw you're with that guy.
he is one of my instructors And he scales like a pineapple
you still remember me?
bunny, you are my every other memory
how do you know I was coming in?
I called your dad.
God, you're like obsessed with me or something.
I'm more than obsessed I'm daffy about you
daffy like a duck?
daffy like a duck!
quack! Quack!
Oh these are... these are for you.
thanks
so you think we have a chance?
anything is possible
it's the beauty of living.
moonlight is raining down
and I chose a blazing road
shining like a pawning tree
the city close a massive rose
swinging on a high trapeze
far above the crowds I see
all I need is Love
spinning around the circus grounds
take me and bring me home again
I see everything in front of me
it's love and only love can bring us home
fires burn from sea to sea
warming me and I am free
open doors in front of me
only time knows where they lead
everything I'll ever need
standing there in front of me
all I see is love
spinning around the circus grounds
take me and bring me home again
I see everything in front of me
it's love and only love can bring us home
only love, only love
love, spinning around the circus grounds
take me and bring me home again
I see everything in front of me
who the hell is he trying to kid?
Hello? Hello, Abbeville?
what? But if you cannot place them, advise Paris.
I'm at my winds end, but carry on.
reinforcements, sir?
why don't you cut out the clowning?
me, sir? What have I done? - Don't ever let me see you...
doing a victory roll over my airfield again.
I thought it would buck up the civilians.
for God's sake, Jamie, give your brain a chance.
corporal, refuel them immediately!
Yes, sir.
so anyway, he hit me and made me nose bleed...
corporal, I don't mean with your blood.
I gave him a couple of socks...
and re-arm them.
Yes, sir!
Hello, Harvey. Where's Jumbo?
posted missing last night.
you acting C. O?
Oh, yeah. Of what?
five serviceable aircraft. No spares. No contact.
first we knew the bastards would overrun us was when we tried to land.
but yes, I hear you very well.
eh? What?
are you sure?
they are at Sedan?
for the benefit of the uneducated among us...
I shall translate.
Archam can't believe that Sedan's fallen. I can.
it's no use. They'll be here in half an hour.
we must leave immediately.
Yes, let's get the hell out of it.
where to, sir?
why don't you follow me and find out? Come on, idiots.
after you.
unless they've got there before us.
get that buzzard out of here! We'll go with what we've got!
all right. Forget your kit. Let's move.
get all the transport you can and get the men out of here.
all N. C.O. S report to me immediately!
you know what to do with the lame ducks?
Yes, sir.
bombs away.
all the yanks, over here!
load 'em up!
over the wing.
flood the cowling.
plenty of it.
right! Stand clear! Into the trucks!
come on! We haven't got all day!
to the permanent Secretary of State for air...
sir, I have the honor to refer to the very serious calls...
which have recently been made upon fighter command...
in an attempt to stem the German invasion...
of the continent.
I hope and believe that our armies may yet be victorious in France and Belgium...
but we have to face the possibility that they may be defeated. In this case...
I presume that there is no one who would deny...
that England should fight on...
even though the remainder of the continent of Europe...
is dominated by the Germans.
I must therefore request...
that not one more fighter be sent across the channel.
if the home defense is drained away in desperate attempts to remedy the situation in France...
defeat in France will involve the final, complete and irremediable defeat of this country.
I have the honor to be, sir...
your obedient servant, H. C.T. Dowding.
air Chief Marshal Dowding, sir.
you do realize, Dowding, the position this puts us in?
I realize that the French have been promised this squadron.
by Churchill personally.
he's given the French prime minister his word.
you do appreciate, Dowding...
that Churchill will have to see this?
that's why I wrote it.
this is the BBC home service.
here is the news.
in the House of Commons this afternoon...
the prime minister, Mr. Churchill, said...
what General de Gaulle called the Battle of France is over.
the battle of Britain is about to begin.
eyes right!
I welcome you in the name of the Second Luftwaffe, General.
thank you, thank you, Kesselring.
my dear Fink. - General.
everything all right?
we are ready, General. We can start.
very well, gentlemen, then forward.
attention!
eyes right!
call out the guard!
attention!
if I have to inspect one more bomber...
I won't recommend you for a Field Marshal, Kesselring.
please, may I finish the inspection?
certainly.
sir.
pleasant return journey.
the English are not ordained by fate to be our enemies.
you heard it yourself, Jeschonnek.
this time he's wrong.
they are completely finished... done for.
we'll never have a chance like this again.
absolute nonsense!
nonsense, do you call it? It's a pure catastrophe.
Herr Baron von Richter.
the Fuehrer will speak to you now.
my dear Max!
how lovely to see you back in Switzerland so soon.
I came straight from Berlin an hour ago.
the ambassador will see you now, sir.
thank you. Excuse me, please.
sir David, I'm again instructed...
to emphasize that the Fuehrer wishes...
to avoid further bloodshed.
england is not our natural enemy...
and he offers guarantees for the British empire...
if you give Germany a free hand in Europe.
goering and his Luftwaffe would like to flatten London...
as a prelude to invasion.
it's two lumps you take, isn't it?
what's left of your army...
abandoned its weapons at Dunkirk.
you're defenseless and just playing for time.
we know of the moves you're making in Washington.
we know the Americans won't be drawn in.
their embassy in London gives you two weeks.
so what's stopping you?
look, David. The Fuehrer is being very reasonable.
he offers guarantees.
experience shows the Fuehrer's guarantees guarantee nothing.
what about Churchill?
after our last appeal, what do we hear?
we will fight them on the beaches.
with what?
winston gets carried away sometimes.
with liquid courage.
that's what they tell me.
clearly, you don't know him.
David, we are not asking for anything.
europe is ours.
we can walk into Britain whenever we like.
if you think we're going to gamble...
on Herr Hitler's guarantees, you're making a grave mistake.
all those years in England seem to have left you none the wiser.
we're not easily frightened.
also, we know how hard it is for an army to cross the channel.
the last little corporal to try it came a cropper.
so don't threaten or dictate to us...
until you're marching up Whitehall!
and even then we won't listen.
heil Hitler.
it's unforgivable.
I lost my temper.
the maddening thing is that he's right.
we're not ready.
we're on our own.
we've been playing for time.
and it's running out.
silly bitch!
he's calling you names again, Harold.
I spent half a week settling her and the kids in the country...
and now, "I'm bored," she says!
one of your elite trying to land without wheels.
Boomps-a-daisy.
it's enough to make you weep.
and welcome home, sir.
undercarriage lever a bit sticky, was it, sir?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it was.
well, I wouldn't tell the C. O. That, sir, not if I were you.
you can teach monkeys to fly better than that!
I'm terribly sorry about that, sir.
it won't happen again. - Keep your jacket on, boy.
how many hours have you done in spits, Simon?
on spits, sir? 10 1/2.
we'll make it eleven before Jerry has you for breakfast.
spring chicken to shite hawk in one easy lesson.
attack, attack, attack...
this is Rabbit Leader. Are you receiving me?
Hello, Rabbit Leader. Red-3 on 3.
receiving you loud and clear.
right. I'll try and get on your tail...
and I want you to take evasive action. Understood?
Hello, Rabbit Leader.
Red-3 on 3. Understood.
attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack...
Hello, Rabbit Leader.
I thought you might come in from the sun.
don't think. Don't just glance.
look! Search for the bastards!
and never fly in a straight line, or you're a dead duck.
sir. - Now, let's try it again.
or, in other words, beware of the Hun in the sun...
who, for reasons best known to himself...
has confined his recent attacks to our channel convoys.
however, this won't last forever.
but it has given us a chance to pull ourselves together...
and to train people like you.
as fighter controllers, you'll be joining an organization...
which, thank the good Lord...
was not rushed up hastily yesterday.
it'll be a pain in the neck to the enemy when he comes.
it's the joker up our sleeves.
now, the R. A.F. Chain shows us where they are.
the information is passed to group...
group scrambles the necessary squadrons...
and you, at sector level...
guide our chaps to the interception.
it's been tried and tested. It works.
so don't blame the system if you're no good.
now, clearly, 11 Group here...
will bear the brunt of the battle...
as those of you who are posted there...
will find out to your discomfort.
12 Group is our second line of defense...
and covers the industrial midlands and the north.
13 Group, Scotland and the northeast...
and 10 Group, the west of England.
more than half the fighter-command squadrons...
are stationed here at 11 Group...
near the coast where we expect the invasion...
and also able to protect London...
which is as far as the bombers can get with fighter escort.
but I think we can leave strategy...
to those with egg on their hats.
attention!
please, gentlemen, the Inspector General has just arrived.
here.
thank you, Captain.
Ah, my dear Foehn. You are well?
Yes, thank you, General. - And Falke?
Yes, thank you, General.
may I introduce my brother Hans, sir?
another fighter ace perhaps?
when I get the chance to fight, General.
general.
we have borrowed this.
dover? - Dover.
those masts are their radio direction finders?
Yes. Their secret weapon.
which we captured at Dunkirk.
our Stukas can deal with them.
excuse me, General, but why?
if they know we're coming, so much the better.
we don't have to look for them.
the pilots are in excellent spirits, General.
I have eyes in my head, Osterkamp.
I merely wanted to say, General...
we shouldn't wait too long.
it may happen sooner than you think.
please, gentlemen.
come, Falke.
thank you, General.
this delay is an incredible piece of luck.
I mean, they roll up France and then stop.
they could've come right on.
you know, our latest intelligence...
is that Herr Hitler is sightseeing in France.
tis rather pleasant weather.
Oh, no, I mean it. He's on holiday.
I'm not complaining, Minister.
no, no, no, seriously, Dowding...
the morale factor is vital.
I saw Beaverbrook on Monday.
now, he's going to be able to deliver as many as a hundred fighters a week.
well, after seeing you...
I want to be able to go back to the cabinet and tell them you're as confident as I am.
damn it, man, we've got 650 planes.
and they have 2, 500 aircraft, haven't they?
they won't all come over at once, and we have radar.
Churchill puts great faith in radar.
it's vital, but it won't shoot down aircraft.
I must say, you don't exactly exude a spirit of optimism.
God willing, we will hold out, Minister.
I see. So I tell the cabinet...
that you're trusting in radar and praying to God... right?
more accurate the other way around.
I'm trusting in God and praying for radar.
but the essential arithmetic is that our young men...
will have to shoot down their young men...
at the rate of four to one if we're to keep pace at all.
it's the oil pressure, sir, but the gauge is being checked.
all right, Charlie. Carry on. - Thank you, sir.
never give up, do you, Charlie?
instrument check, sir.
I hope your new C. O. Believes you.
he's going to be one of your headaches now.
they know the orders... don't tangle unnecessarily.
so it's "May I do an engine check, sir?"
or an undercarriage check or a radio?
any excuse to get at the Jerries.
at least it shows they're keen.
Yeah, they're a good bunch.
God knows what I'll find in Scotland.
a lot of kids with down on their cheeks.
Yeah, training them to be fighter pilots...
is a damn sight more dodgy than fighting Germans.
well, you've got to earn that new stripe somehow.
at least I got three days in town.
give my regards to your wife.
Thanks.
may I have a word, sir?
send us back a haggis.
if you want permission for a test flight...
the answer is no.
large scotch, please.
you with that lot down the road, sir?
no.
one and six, please.
thank you. - Thank you.
have you applied for that post in Scotland?
darling, I can't. - You can't.
you know I can't.
you mean you don't want to. - Can't. I've got a job.
what have we got? What the hell is this?
is it a marriage or a flaming air force committee?
for God's sake, Colin, don't start that all over again.
I knew this would happen.
I never wanted you to join up... never.
Colin, please, try to behave as if I were a human being.
you look more like a parade-ground suffragette to me.
I'm just not cut out to wave a wet hankie on sooty stations.
for God's sake, who's asking you to?
we'll be in Scotland together.
I never could stand marching women.
you couldn't care less, could you?
I cared enough to come here fifty miles.
I didn't measure it.
I did.
I even booked a room.
three days.
it would be marvelous.
are you going to apply for that posting or not?
left, right, left.
right, left, right, left, right.
squad, halt!
right turn!
order arms!
now, wait for it.
squad...
dismissed!
come on, Albert, you're not dead yet.
it's his turn. - You'll be lucky.
twelve pints, please, Fred.
one for the sarge.
let him get his own.
no, sir, it's not Charlie.
it's some Hurricane out of juice very likely.
right. Call me directly you hear anything.
well, somebody must have spotted him.
he can't just disappear.
all right, I'll hang on.
sir, it's Air Vice Marshal Park.
that's all we need now.
Jamie, hang onto this.
good afternoon, sir.
tell your men to relax.
how are they making out, Canfield?
half the squadron are new pilots, sir.
that's why you were sent here, to lick them into shape.
they get less warning here than any other station...
so they must learn to get up from standby in two minutes flat if they're to intercept the enemy.
hello. Dispersal.
right.
stand down, "A" flight.
yours?
Yes, sir.
the chaps spoil her.
all right, Canfield, what's up?
you have a pilot missing.
Yes, sir.
over the channel.
is he much overdue?
over two hours, sir.
I thought I'd made it clear we're too near the enemy...
for pilots to go swanning around on their own.
we can't afford to lose them this way.
what's the excuse this time, undercarriage check?
instruments, sir.
we've all done it, but that's no excuse.
what's his name?
pilot officer Lambert, sir.
Gerhardt, my bath!
Yes, certainly, Major.
do me a favor. Not now, Papa.
these are the day's instructions for the Luftwaffe...
and they must go off today. - All right, if I must.
I know, you have just found it.
that doesn't concern you. Hurry up, old man...
because my evening meal will not wait for you.
in exactly five minutes, we drive to Boulogne, OK?
Hans, look after Major Foehn.
good evening, sir. May I lead the way?
certainly, my boy. Lead on.
don't let him near the wine cellar!
what's the best way to evade a Spitfire, Major, shallow dive?
and curving in at the same time.
but excuse me, Major, my brother says...
a Spitfire can outmaneuver a 109.
when we are in England, let him take up a Spitfire...
and prove it to me in my 109.
done! But don't forget your life jacket!
I said look after our guest, Hans, not drown him.
major Foehn doesn't think much of the shot-method.
if you would teach your boys to shoot a little sharper...
the problem wouldn't arise.
excuse me, Jafu II. You are to report to Wissant.
what, now, Papa? - Immediately.
and Major Foehn also.
I think I know why we've been asked to go to Wissant.
this is it.
gentlemen... Eagle Day!
the destruction of the Royal Air Force on the ground.
zero hour for takeoff 7: 15 A. M.
our targets today in southern England...
are the following airfields.
Manston, Biggin, Kenley...
dover, Hawkinge.
it is our task to destroy the R. A.F. On the ground.
there'll be nothing left for us.
don't worry, gentlemen...
our omnibus drivers won't be able to destroy everything.
some Spitfires will remain, anyway.
even for you, Bruno.
therefore, gentlemen...
fly in at maximum height and make good use of it.
and try not to land in the Channel.
especially use your eyes and watch your petrol gauges.
remember, you've only got thirty minutes over there.
come on, chaps.
away, I'm here.
hostile 2-3.
morning, all.
bearing 1-8-6, range thirty miles.
twenty plus.
height, six thousand.
Yes, Danmoor, I confirm.
no I. F.F.
hostile 2-9, now thirty plus.
Yes, Danmoor, I confirm.
recheck I. F.F. please, Bentmarle.
sorry to call you in, sir, but something's building.
2-8 now forty plus.
Convoys?
none due through until tonight, sir.
hostile 3-1 forty plus, 1-6.
better bring more squadrons to standby.
right, sir. Get me Beacon Hill.
reconfirm Hostile 2-3.
hostile 2-3, 1-8-0.
getting interference again, sir.
not now, corporal, not now.
that's better.
five miles.
I'm afraid the raid is entering my ground range, Danmoor.
stukas.
get them up.
43 Squadron, intercept Hostile 2-1.
that was Danmoor, sir.
Ventnar radar out of action.
who's covering Dover?
54 Squadron, sir.
6th Squadron's airborne, sir.
too slow. Some of them took six and seven minutes.
they'll have to do it in two.
tallyho, Velvet Leader!
down there on the left.
Stukas!
Roger. Here we go.
attacking now.
yellow section, keep your eyes peeled for the escort.
Spitfire!
easier to hit than a barn door.
it's like shooting rats in a barrel.
you'll be in a barrel if you don't watch out for the fighters.
what's the matter? Can you hear me?
Ventnar, and now Dover's out of action.
our plots are drying up. - Then we're blind.
so now we've only got the observer corps.
this is only the beginning.
they won't stop now.
Heinkels.
make it a hundred plus.
Hello? Hello? Heinkels, hundred plus.
Yes, Center. Still going north.
height?
twelve thousand.
dispersal.
2 Section, scramble!
look alive!
engine trouble!
lookout.
right.
muck and filth everywhere, Mr. Warrick. It's like a pigsty!
the cooks don't come on till 6: 00.
well, you've got some defaulters. Put them onto it.
come on you lots, move!
you'd be there fast enough if it was real!
at the double!
Oh, my God.
section Officer Harvey!
sir.
I've noticed that some of your girls...
are now using the men's trenches during air raid practice.
it's got to stop. - Sir.
and another thing... gas mask cases...
they're for gas masks. They're not handbags.
I do realize, of course, that female requirements differ somewhat from the male.
nevertheless, that's no excuse to...
God's teeth!
take cover!
bastards.
at least we know what Jerry's going for.
all our airfields, unfortunately.
it's a squadron scramble, sir.
don't be wet. Get me the duty controller.
we've only just come down. We're still refueling.
don't just stand there! Get one up!
corporal Johnson!
engine blocks away!
rest of you men, in the trenches!
talk about a hairy takeoff.
I saw Jimmy buy it. - Did Archie get off?
Oh, I'm with you old boy, but I've left my stomach behind.
Ah, shut up, will you!
rabbit Leader to Cowslip Control.
do you read me? Over.
for Christ's sake, Cowslip, wake up, will you?
rabbit Squadron airborne.
close up, Red-2!
stick to me like glue, Simon.
rabbit Leader, sorry about that. This is Cowslip.
about time, too. Where'd they go?
bandits now twenty miles east of you heading southeast.
sector 1-2-0 and make Angels 2-0.
we'll go, Cowslip.
rabbit's turning port... now.
come in, Red-2. Where the hell are you?
where the hell are you, Simon?
you, lads, pull yourselves together!
get moving! Get another shovel!
Bates, pull yourself together.
stay with them, Seymour.
it's all right. I'll see to it.
how about two hands over here, Officer?
run the hoses out over here!
put that cigarette out!
the mains have gone! Can't you smell gas?
don't you yell at me, Mr. Warrick!
here, you men!
don't stand there looking at it, you idle shover!
you! Get me some stretchers and the orderly.
ma'am. - Fast!
you can stand some of the girls down now, Corporal.
Jones, Whitman, clear up that mess.
then you can take five minutes.
43, stand down.
1-1-1 released.
5-0-1 are down at Tangbear.
they couldn't get in at Big Wing.
few more days like this...
and we won't be able to get them down anywhere.
I suppose we could always pull them all back...
north of the Thames, out of range.
that is precisely what they want us to do.
this is the BBC home service.
here is the 9: 00 news.
large formations of enemy aircraft...
today attacked targets in southern England...
but the enemy's aerial armada came in for heavy punishment.
over forty-seven German planes were destroyed...
with a loss of only fifteen of our own aircraft.
six of these pilots were saved.
several R. A.F. Aerodromes were also attacked...
and some casualties were sustained...
but they were light.
Colonel.
good. Very good.
the weather is constant.
we have a stabilized high pressure zone...
and we'll make use of it.
the proof, gentlemen. We are destroying as many planes on the ground as in the air.
thank you, Schmidt. On the desk, please.
Reichsmarschall Goering will certainly be interested in my report.
to date, almost 300 planes have been destroyed.
almost half the entire British fighter force, gentlemen.
the Colonel can report what he pleases.
the fact remains...
that our bombers continue to be intercepted.
because the English are now bringing in their reserves.
as from tomorrow, we'll increase our attacks on these airfields.
and five Luftwaffes will attack the north and north-east.
but that is outside the range of our fighters, Colonel.
also outside the range of the English fighters.
not even a Spitfire can be in the north and the south... at the same time .
how far are we from the coast?
everybody, Action Stations.
tomato Heinz to all. Tomato Heinz to all.
another ten minutes to target.
all ready at Fighter Stations.
another ten minutes to target. End.
look! Spitfire!
help yourself, everybody. There's no fighter escort.
there! Right behind us!
soapbox Leader, break it off.
home and tea.
for once you deserve it. Well done, everybody.
heinkel, three-second burst.
starboard engine. Ruddy great flamer.
any identification marks?
yellow stripes on the wings.
wing leader. See it go down?
did I? Nyaow... plunk!
hmm. Graham and Jack will confirm your story.
that's three of you who got him.
1/3 of a kill, laddie, 1/3.
sir.
what did you hit? - A Heinkel.
anyone see mine go in? - Didn't know you were with us.
well done, Peter.
only 1/3 of a one, sir.
Oh, that's better than nothing.
I used to blast away and never hit a sausage.
one thing though...
what's that, sir?
it takes us two years to train people like you.
suppose your controls had been damaged.
what would've happened to that idiotic victory roll?
you'd have been spread all over the damn field...
like strawberry jam. Never again. Clear?
Yes, sir.
the old man's just gone down to the OPs room with Sasha.
final figures of the northern raids...
twenty-three without loss.
jolly good. I'll show it to him.
right.
we're getting 6 volunteer pilots from Coastal Command...
and from the Fleet Air Arms, sir...
five from each of the Fairday battle squadrons...
and three from army cooperation.
that's thirty, is it? Not enough.
we lost that many yesterday.
and the air staff hesitate to weaken the light bombers...
in case of invasion, sir.
we need pilots now.
what about the foreign squadrons under training?
czechs, Poles?
I know your feelings about the language difficulties.
they don't understand a word that's said over the air.
they're a menace to themselves and us.
I'll try and cut more corners off the training program.
pilots are doing well...
enemy losing at the rate of two to one...
then he can afford to, can't he?
never sends more than half his bombers at one time.
we must find more pilots...
or lose.
begin. This is off speed.
check 5-0-1 back at ready desk...
I think you ought to see this, sir.
thank you.
air raid warning.
sector Three Red.
rabbit Squadron.
tallyho, tallyho, Red Section.
we'll take the rear starboard.
yellow, you take the port.
Yellow-1 Wilco.
tallyho, Yellow.
Amaliel, keep your eyes open for the Red Squad.
rabbit Leader, Red-3, you're on those bastards...
six o'clock high. Coming down now.
Roger, Red-3. I see them.
rabbit, brave right and climb.
behind you, Andy! On your tail!
get out, Andy!
jump!
hurry up! Out!
all out!
don't any of you Joes talk English?
Corporal!
sir!
where are you taking those vultures?
officers to the mess, ensigns to the guard room, sir.
like hell you are. They're responsible for all that.
get them to clear it up. - But what about the officers?
give them a bloody shovel.
come on, step with it!
skipper hates Jerries.
he'll hate me if you don't get that gun repaired.
then wrap up this little lot.
only eight for the morning?
got to do better than that.
five are write-offs.
one has another guard gone, and two are missing, sir.
Mr. Anthony and Sergeant Moore.
and these two are hundred-hour checks.
they've been at it for 48 hours solid, sir.
I know.
where the hell have you been?!
learning to swim.
do your best, Blaine. - Roger.
you get one?
all I got was a bellyful of English Channel.
when are you going to learn?
I didn't know they were there.
never fly straight and level for more than thirty seconds in the combat area.
how many times have I told you? Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I'd rather walk, sir.
cut out the "sir."
you called your wife?
all right, boy. Get in.
here you are, sir.
thank you.
it's ridiculous!
we go up four or five times a day...
and every time we come down, more potholes.
there are more potholes until we can't bloody well get in a door.
we'll get this place operational again.
you won't. Not until someone decides...
to protect it while we're up.
what flaming genius thought of sending us...
to that dump of a flying club?
don't blame me. Direct orders from group.
park himself. It's not a bad little field.
I've seen it. Damp tents...
and a nasty little shack full of dead flies.
at least you won't have the Jerries visiting you.
I don't blame them.
how much longer, Hobbes?
the engine's overheating, and so am I.
we either stand down or blow up.
which do you want?
hostile 1-6, reconfirm, please.
need some more Yellow sevens, Flight.
this is R-29, now forty plus. 1-5.
Yes. 2-6 and 4-1 detected, sir.
7 Squadron's airborne, sir.
thank you. Let 12 Group know. And make sure they know...
they're protecting my airfields while they're up.
they have been told, sir. - Tell them again.
pine Tree Leader, this is Turkey Control.
vector 1-9-2.
I have some trade for you over Maidstone.
turkey Control, Pine Tree Leader.
Roger 1-9-0.
pine Tree, this is Turkey.
twenty plus bandits and Angels 2-0 heading west.
Roger, Turkey Control.
indiana left. Making low level attack.
Roger. I see you. I'm breaking left to attack.
my God! Fighters coming down now!
fire speed. Break.
break!
on your tail, Jamie.
enemy aircraft approaching, sir.
coming straight for us. Flying course, 21st.
about eight thousand feet.
I'm taking cover.
tin hats, everybody.
that should damn well never have happened.
where the hell is 12 Group? - They were requested, sir.
they're nowhere in sight.
find out what the devil they think they're playing at.
they just fell on us.
they got my number two and the C. O.
you saw Canfield go down?
it blew up.
just blew up.
bad as we thought? - Worse.
kenley and Biggenor are shambles again...
and the rest are not much better.
God knows how many aircraft we'll have in the morning.
all because 12 Group didn't do their stuff.
Leigh-Mallory and his so-called Big Wings.
might as well stay on the ground for all the use they are.
we were up, sir.
trying to knock out the enemy en masse.
but it takes time to assemble 40 or 50 aircraft at 15, 000 feet.
it takes far too long.
by the time your Big Wing is up...
the enemy have hit their targets and are on their way home.
all that matters is to shoot them down in large numbers.
I'd rather destroy fifty after they've hit their targets...
than ten before.
don't forget the targets are my airfields, Leigh-Mallory...
and you're not getting fifty. You're not even getting ten.
gentlemen, you're missing the essential truth.
we're short of two hundred pilots.
those we have are tired, strained...
and all overdue for relief.
we're fighting for survival.
losing.
we don't need a big wing or a small wing.
we need pilots.
and a miracle.
good night, gentlemen.
good night, sir. - Good night, sir.
and now, over to the Savoy Hotel, London...
for dance music until midnight...
with Carrol Gibbons and his Savoy Hotel Orpheans.
you look a damn sight better out of uniform.
hardly remember you out of yours.
and who's fault's that?
for God's sake, not again.
look, damn it, my squadron's come south.
you just apply for that posting!
Colin, no!
all right, agreed! Taboo subject tonight.
old wafs.
you really think we're solemnly going...
to get into these ridiculous garments?
not at this stage, surely.
I'm shy.
Oh, Maggie, come on.
it's just...
I am shy.
honestly.
I'll put out the light.
no, Colin!
no, it's not just bed, it's us!
it's you.
and me.
you and me.
we should have been over target nine minutes ago.
the wind has veered.
so where are we?
where is London?
far back in the south-west.
good. Then get rid of the bombs and let's go home.
Colin.
I will put in for that posting.
promise.
that's their bombs!
they're bombing London!
it isn't funny! Cut it out!
too damn close.
Colin, I promise.
I promise.
attacks on London are strictly forbidden.
this order you know as well as I do, Major Brandt.
these attacks may only be flown...
on the specific order of the Fuehrer.
I regret, gentlemen...
that this is now completely out of my hands.
by order of Vice Marshal Goering...
you two are to report to Berlin to testify.
thank you.
major Brandt?
flying Officer Froedl. Please follow me.
would you believe it?
don't they know there's a blackout?
you know what Goering said:
if ever a bomb falls on Berlin...
you may call me Meier. - Hmm.
you are to report to Colonel Schroeder at 9 A. M. Sharp.
this car will take you to your quarters...
and you are to remain there.
as from today, we are called Meier.
last night, bombs were dropped on Berlin by the British.
so be it.
that is a game at which two can play.
if the R. A.F. Drops three, four five thousand kilograms of bombs on Germany in one night...
then in one night we shall drop three hundred...
four hundred, five hundred, five thousand on England!
when they attack our cities, we will flatten theirs.
then we will obliterate them!
the hour will come when one of us must crack.
it will never be National Socialist Germany!
Never! Never!
the English are wondering.
they keep asking, "Why doesn't he come?"
be patient. Patience.
we are coming.
we are coming!
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
attention!
Reichsmarschall, I welcome you in the name of...
it's all right, Kesselring. Thank you, thank you.
Ah, Osterkamp, everything all right?
Yes, sir.
then it can begin.
come with me, Kesselring. - Yes.
don't stand around like a bunch of pigs!
fall in!
I'll let the lot of you swim over the Channel!
attention!
in the ditch! March! Get off the road!
attention!
there they come.
if we lose the war now...
they'll tear our arses asunder.
arrow to Rabbit Leader.
vector 1-6-0.
bandits one hundred plus.
angels 1-5.
bandits one hundred plus. Over.
rabbit to Arrow.
I can't see them.
but they must be there.
well, come have a look for yourself then.
nothing, I repeat, nothing.
group, please.
everything we've got, and get them moving.
they've caught us this time.
they're turning northwest. It looks like London.
it's London, all right...
and we've got everything up covering airfields.
where is the Royal Air Force?
Messerschmidt. - Iron Corps.
Messerschmidt!
no, they ain't. They're Iron Corps.
five seconds.
away!
away!
the pressure's dropping again.
this is as far as I can get, lad.
down at the end there, by that car.
Hey, no you don't. - What do you mean?
there's a thousand-pounder down there...
and it's not gone off.
if you're looking for somebody...
they're all down at the church hall.
they got the Rose 'n' Crown.
he'll have to drink at the Red Lion now.
if they'll have him.
how bloody stupid can you get?
I spend half a leaf seeing you all safe in the country...
and you bring her back to all this.
I'm sorry, it's just we missed everyone.
you're all going back.
dad, have you finished it?
have you got it?
thank you.
there's a family trapped in Shaw Street.
can we have some more volunteers?
I'll be back, luv.
stop that bloody bell!
it came more from the back.
not real Spitfires.
they couldn't land here.
you'll see in a minute.
only officers fly Spitfires.
you're not a fighter pilot.
what about your top button?
anybody can do that.
T-5? What's that?
they're a training squadron, sir.
the Poles.
get them out of it. Get them down.
blackhawk Leader, vector 2-3-0...
and return to base immediately. Over.
blackhawk Leader. Received and understood. Out.
blackhawk Leader to "A" flight.
turn to port and steer 2-3-0.
Germans! Germans, on the right!
I don't see! Where? - Down there on the right!
I see the Jerries. I see!
stop that Polish chatter and steer 2-3-0.
repeat, please.
I say again, 2-3-0.
repeat, please.
for crying out loud, 2-3-0!
repeat, please. - Repeat, please.
now, just shut up, the lot of you, and follow me...
unless you're blind as well as...
Oh, God's truth.
shut up!
silence, in Polish!
get out quickly!
one, the R. A.F. Is not a flying circus.
two, strict R. T. Procedure will be observed at all times.
and it is never... repeat, never... to be used...
for private Polish chitchat.
finally, and God alone knows why...
I've received the following signal.
Congratulations. As of today, this squadron is operational.
signed, Keith Park...
air Vice Marshal, A. O.C. 11 Group.
I was wrong about the Poles.
we also have the second Polish squadron, sir.
I thought you'd mention that.
all right. Make them operational.
and the Canadians?
and the Czechs. We need them all.
looks like London again, sir.
Yes.
and there's nothing we can do about it.
but if Goering should concentrate on London by day...
it's another matter.
if it means he leaves my airfields alone...
I shan't complain.
even a few days would give me the chance...
to get back to full strength.
he'll have farther to come.
and to go back.
we'll have more time to intercept.
what's more important, Park...
his fighters have only fuel enough for ten minutes over London.
his bombers will lose much of their protection.
for the first time...
they'll all come within the range of 12 Group.
perhaps now, at last, we shall see...
what Leigh-Mallory's Big Wings are made of.
turning on London could be the Germans' biggest blunder.
spider Leader, this is Top Hat Control.
bandits now twenty miles east of you, heading southeast.
vector 1-2-0.
make, Angel 2-0. - Roger, Top Hat.
fox Trot Leader, this is Tango Control.
fox Trot Leader, Pass your message.
I have some trade for you building up over green A.
Roger, Tango.
spider Leader, Top Hat Control.
your customers appear to be splitting up.
main course heading for London will be your target.
vector 0-9-0.
Roger, Top Hat.
Batman Control. Climb to Angels 1-9.
Roger, Batman.
thank you again.
this should give them something to think about.
starlight Control to Dogtail.
keep an eye out for a friendly wing...
joining you on your port side.
Roger, Starlight.
I see them. I see them.
bloody marvelous.
fox Trot Leader, Tango Control.
bandits now probably slightly below you.
Roger, Tango. I've got them.
peewee Leader turning starboard now.
watch out for 109s about.
Roger, Fairfield Leader. Going up now.
take the left-hand pair, Blue Leader.
Roger.
everybody else, keep tight.
swarms of them, sir!
fox Trot Leader, cut that out.
everyone keep quiet.
leave the flaming fighters.
it's the bloody bombers we want.
ox, will you pipe down?
on fire, son of a gun!
ox! Behind you!
behind!
I am on fire! I'm bailing out!
good afternoon.
good afternoon my ass, you Boche bastard.
put your hands up! Come on, put them up!
what is it? I'm a Polish pilot...
cor blimey. Your mitts, mate... your mitts.
put 'em up there. Go on. Get going.
where are you taking me? I'm fighting on your side!
can we get in?
and fetch the doctor. - Good.
I know, young man.
get out of the way, man.
it's coming. It's coming.
are you telling me that your losses are critical?
we're bombing day and night, Reichsmarschall.
our losses are high, and our pilots are tired...
and the planes need servicing.
be specific! What are you telling me?!
the English have changed tactics.
changed tactics? How?
they are attacking in large numbers.
our losses might be reduced if our formations...
were more closely escorted by fighters, sir.
the fighters are always there.
but not close enough, is that it?
you, yourself, were a fighter pilot.
the fighter is a hunter, sir.
I was a fighter pilot.
I was not a coward!
there is no suggestion of cowardice, sir!
I am making the suggestion!
from now on the fighters will stay close with our bombers.
and lose their natural advantages of surprise and speed?
you will obey orders!
the invasion cannot begin until we have cleared the skies.
come, my friends, I have chastised you enough.
but I am here to help him.
is there anything you want?
Yes, sir, a squadron of Spitfires.
stop... vapor trail.
left and above.
vulture Leader to everyone.
keep quiet. Hold positions.
we'll encircle them only when they close up to firing distance.
we'll take the rear starboard.
yellow, you take the port.
Roger.
thanks awfully, old chap.
sir, you know...
I have promised the Fuehrer...
to clear the skies and totally destroy the R. A.F.
I expect to be obeyed!
here we are.
the miracle of the loaves.
we should have moved in here before we were bombed.
Maggie, I'd like you to meet our new assistant controller.
squadron Leader Tom Evans, Section Officer Harvey.
how do you do?
hello.
he knows your old man.
how is Colin?
haven't seen him since my little escapade with the burning Hurricane.
excuse me, ma'am.
ma'am. There's a call for you.
will you excuse me just a minute?
Yes. - Thanks.
it's around the corner.
Hello?
it's me.
how on earth did you get through here?
put it down to rank.
I said I was an old battle-ax from the Air Ministry.
Colin. That was very clever.
any news?
about?
your posting, you silly idiot.
well, you've applied.
I've been so busy here.
it's really not as simple as all that.
look, why the hell not?
to be absolutely honest, I forgot.
I know, darling. I'm sorry.
Groopy's here now.
I'll go and talk to him right away. All right?
all right?
Colin?
Colin?
get through all right, sir?
Yes.
let me give you a piece of advice.
what's that, sir?
stay single.
are you still with me, Dogtail Red-2?
affirmative, Red Leader.
directly behind you and on your starboard side.
what happened to Harvey?
he got a 1-0-9, then ran into trouble...
but he's all right.
no mistake. I saw him bail out.
right, right, attention.

narrator: This is Archibald Suchot, a treasure hunter, explorer, and engineer.
he spent ten years in Africa building every type of useful thing.
by the way, it's in the heart of Africa that ourstory begins.
well, this really isn 't Africa; it's Connecticut, and this is the house that Archibald lived in before he mysteriously disappeared.
but that's a story that Archibald's grandson would be more qualified to tell you.
you'll see that he's quite a charming kid who answers to the name of...
Arthur! -...Arthur.
Where's he gone to this time?
and the dog's disappeared too,
Alfred!
Oh, yes, you'll see, He'll be a great guard dog,
Alfred!
I wonder what exactly it is he'll be guarding,
if you could at least answer when I call,
Arthur,
Arthur!
attack! Men, come to my aid!
calm down, It's me, Granny, - Oh, sorry,
I was in Africa,
I can tell, Did you have a good trip?
fantastic, I was in a tribe with Grandpa, Look,
grandpa painted a canvas that he placed in a circle,
that way, the animals pace round and round it, but can't find us,
it's incredible!
it's all the inventions Grandpa made for the isolated tribe,
Yes, he was more interested in African tribes than he was his own,
look, he dug a super-deep well and invented a whole irrigation system out of bamboo pods,
you know, it wasn't Grandpa who invented that,
it was the Romans,
they called them viaducts,
Romans, I never heard of that tribe,
it's a very old tribe,
the leader was called Caesar,
like the salad?
Yes, like the salad,
put that book back where you got it,
we have to go shopping,
granny, please, could I drive on the way back?
I don't know, Arthur, We'll see,
Oh, please, Grandpa would always
GRANNY: Grandpa's not here, and I'm in charge, - Did he follow you? - I don't think so,
perfect!
perfect,
there, It's all there,
perfect, This is wonderful, Thank you so much, - What do I owe you? - Are you crazy?
nothing, Nothing at all, Now get going before he catches you,
I'm speechless, Thanks so much,
I'm counting on you to let me know how it went,
I will, I'll call you tomorrow,
Oh, Arthur,
Arthur, it's fine, You go off and play,
go off while it's still light, Absolutely, - Thanks, Granny, - Sure,
Yes! Yes! World champion!
GRANNY: Alfred!
watch carefully, Alfred,
you are about to witness the invention of the largest irrigation system in the county, bigger than Grandpa's, better than Caesar's,
this is Arthur's, invention,
perfect,
by the grace of God,
Alfred! Congratulations!
it's a remarkable invention, lt'll go down in history, believe me!
Arthur, telephone,
you'll have to excuse me,
probably the President calling to congratulate me,
narrator: It was not the President on the line, but, rather, Arthur's parents calling from the city.
he was thrilled to heartheirvoices.
one of Grandpa's colleagues,
but I followed Grandpa's blueprints, and it works really well,
I hope you can get here before nighttime,
how tough times had gone forhis family.
we're still in the city, - Though he missed them terrribly,
Arthur understood that his parents had gone to the city to find betterr jobs.
no, not exactly, dear, Jobs are really scarce these days,
although a boy's tenth birthday is supposed to be a happy time, the phone call made him very sad.
father: You're a young man now, and we gotta all make sacrifices...
narrator: He listened as they apologized over and over again for not being able to be with him.
, sweetie, I promise, Just keep your chin up,
but we miss you terrribly, honey...
narrator: Indeed, times were tough, and his mother and father were doing their best to take care of him.
it wasn't the President,
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday, dear Arthur
happy birthday to, You
you know what?
you're the best granny in the world,
and you're the best grandson,
go on, blow them out,
presents first,
Oh, All right, This is from Alfred,
I never had a new one before, Thank you, Alfred,
if you can wait till you're outside to throw it, I'd consider that a favor,
okay, You're right,
and this is from me,
this is beautiful,
but how did you manage to bake a cake?
I thought the oven was broken,
Mrs, Kerman from the hardware store actually made it,
still like it?
it's fantastic,
just too big for three,
don't be too hard on them, Arthur,
they try their best,
I spend my whole year in boarding school in England,
when I come back for vacation, they're not even here,
anyway, I'm used to it now,
they're never here for my birthday,
wait, Make a wish,
I wish that, for my next birthday, Grandpa would be here to share it,
GRANNY: Every night, this magnificent sunset was all ours,
it's precisely into this landscape that your mother came into the world,
while I was having the baby, your grandfather was painting this,
but what were you doing in Africa?
well, I was a nurse and your grandfather was already an engineer,
we met there, and we had the same dream
to help others and to meet wonderful people, - Who are they? - The Bogo Matassalai,
your grandfather helped build an irrigation ditch for them, and in return, they gave him a big bag of rubies,
Really?
really,
the Bogo Matassalai were very, very tall,
they say that nature always balances itself with its opposite,
the Chinese call it the yin and the yang, and for centuries, they searched for them in order to find perfect harmony,
and did they find them?
Yes, There was another tribe living right next to them, and they had this particular trait
they were small as a tooth,
and they called them the Minimoys,
wow, Did they get along?
Oh, wonderfully,
soon they were inseparable, the one side very incredibly tall, the other incredibly small, and only together could they have a complete vision of the world,
who's this?
this is the Princess Selenia, daughter of the king of the Minimoys,
she's beautiful,
I mean, this is incredible,
Yes, and the king himself gave your grandfather the secret of how to find him anytime he wanted,
that's what your grandfather said,
I'd like to meet the Minimoys too,
now, to sleep,
sweet dreams,
we miss you, Archibald,
we really do,
it was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle And now the young monsieurr and madame have rung the chapel bell C'est la vie, said the old folks
it goes to show you never can tell
No!
how you doin', kid?
Whoa! Ow, ow!
think that's funny, huh?
go fetch, brat boy!
nice shot,
Ah! Mr, Davido, you startled me!
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I've just come to settle things about the land,
no, thank you, We're not interested,
irrelevant, Done, Signed, sealed, and delivered,
you didn't waste any time,
it was a coincidence, really, I was in church this morning
you were in church? I've never seen you there,
I usually sit in the back, It's modesty, really,
you really should've been there, You would've seen the mayor, who confirmed the document that says in two days' time, this land and everything on it belongs to me, the president of the bank who transfered your debt to me, and, as amazing as it may seem, you know who else was there?
the notary and the chief of police, who countersigned the order of eviction,
so you see, there's not a single signature missing, and if your husband does not sign this paper within the next 48 hours,
I will be under the obligation to evict you from this property whether your laundry's dry or not,
Oh! You should hang him up to dry as well, - We gonna have to leave the house? - I'm afraid so,
I won't be able to hold off that vulture Davido much longer,
what about the treasure? The rubies that the Matassalai gave Grandpa?
your grandpa hid them somewhere out there in the yard,
I dug for weeks,
he hid them so well I haven't been able to find them,
where you going?
you think I'm gonna hang around twiddling my thumbs for 48 hours?
I'm going to find the treasure!
just like his grandpa,
you should go and find my car rather than sitting there watching,
I can't believe he'd have hidden his treasure in the yard without leaving some sort of clue or note
something to help us find it, "Maltazard, the Evil M,
I hope I have the honor of meeting you one day, Princess,
in the meantime, permit me to steal a kiss,
jealous,
I knew it!
to get to the land of the Minimoys, put your trust in Shakespeare,
Shakespeare? What tribe is he from?
house is here, south is that way,
the tree, the elf, the moon,
it's all there, Alfred, we found it! Yes!
Ahh! - Hang on there, young man,
Arthur, how many times do I have to tell you,
I don't want you playing in this room, - Excuse me, Please go ahead, - Thank you,
granny, who are these guys?
this gentleman is going to evaluate some of your grandpa's things,
granny, you aren't gonna sell Grandpa's things?
Arthur, I'm afraid I don't have any choice,
Yes, we do, Look! It's the map to get to the Minimoys, - What map? - They're here!
grandpa brought them back from Africa with him,
if we can get to them, I'm sure they can lead us to the treasure,
Arthur, you're a big boy now, right?
you don't really believe there are little elves running around the garden just waiting for you to visit so they can slap a bag of rubies in your hands,
pardon me?
Oh, nothing, I was just chatting with my grandson,
if you have jewels, we are interested,
unfortunately, not a jewel on the horizon,
go to your room, Now.
some words may hide others, William S,
s" for Socrates?
Shakespeare,
william Shakespeare,
Oh, Not too far off,
Yes,
better hurry and make your choice before I change my mind, - Come on, Let's go, - Granny
let's go,
it's not very much for 30 years of memories,
down payment, If I sell them well, there's more,
thank you, - Mrs, Suchot? - Yes?
narrator: Suddenly, they were on a very slippery slope, indeed.
with Davido's threats looming, hardships began to mount and doom arrived at the door along with the debt collectors.
, and procedural fees added, that comes to a total of $295, 05,
may l?
here's your change, - Hello, - Sweetie, it's Mom.
is everything all right? - Great, We're cleaning up today,
it's amazing how much old stuff just piles up around the place,
but thanks to Granny, we threw it all out, - Arthur, don't upset your parents,
did you hang up on your mother?
of course not, It hung up by itself,
she'll call back in a second,
granny, they've cut the phone line! Don't you see what's happening?
we've fallen into their trap, and it's closing in on us a little bit more every minute, but as long as I live and breathe, they're not gonna get this house, "Some words may hide others,
of course!
narrator: Archibald had left his grandson the following note:
dear Arthur: I'm sorry I left you without saying good-bye, "but just because you can't see me doesn 't mean I'm not here.
I've gone to visit our friends from Africa and recover our rubies.
if you're reading this, then I probably never returned, "but there is still hope, for my mission now falls to you
if you accept it, that is.
I accept, Grandpa, "Good.
you must follow my specific instructions.
only then can you unlock the passage to the invisible world of the Minimoys.
it can only be opened every ten moons.
that's ten months to you and me.
august the first,
that's today,
GRANNY: Night brings good counsel, Arthur, We'll sleep on it,
tomorrow will bring a solution, - Good night, Granny, - Good night, World in my hands, World in my hands,
GRANDPA: "Number one, go to the chimney.
all of the tools you'll need to make the journey are in my study.
hopefully, your cleverr grandmother hasn 't locked the door.
but if she has, you're a clever boy, and I'm sure you'll figure out something.
I thought you were in the shower,
no, I was in the living room looking for my sleeping drops, and if you don't get back into bed this second,
I'm gonna make you drink the whole bottle!
go!
go on, go on,
you know, I don't like to do this, but I'm gonna lock you in,
I don't want you to do anything stupid tonight, - Okay, - Okay,
Alfred, what are you doing?
go to sleep!
is it the full moon or what?
thank you, Alfred,
granny?

now turn the valve.
inside you'll find a key.
always keep this key with you.
always keep this key with you, "Number two: In a suitcase is a diagram.

Numberthree: look forthe gnome who resides behind the house.
he marks the passage.
I need more light,
I've seen Granny do this a hundred times,

perfect,
sorry, old man, "Number four:
place the tribal canvas overthe passage, "and the passage will open at precisely midnight.
you know where I keep my telescope. Get it.
it will serve as yourtransport to the invisible world.
now for the dolls,
Alfred!
Arthur?
uh, yeah, - Follow me, - Okay,
Hi, - Time to go, - You're not coming?
only one can pass through, and you seem to us to be the best choice to combat Evil M,
Maltazard,
never, never speak that name, It brings bad luck,
okay, Okay,
your grandfather went off to defeat him, and now it's up to you to continue his fight,
thanks for the honor, but I think it might be better if I leave my place to one of you,
I mean, you're so much bigger and stronger than me,
your heart is the strongest of weapons,
okay,
first ring for the body, three times, to the right,
the second ring for the mind, three times, to the left,
and the third ring,
one whole turn, for the soul,
there, The door is open, You can introduce yourself, - lntroduce myself? - Yes,
and try to be convincing, because you only have five minutes,
all right, Be convincing,
okay, Okay,
uh, there's a, um, with, - Archibald? - No,
introduce yourself,
I'm his grandson, My name is Arthur,
and you are,?
Saimono Matrodoy de Betameche,
right,
but you can call me Beta,
pleased to meet you, Beta,
now hold on, I'm not supposed to talk to strangers,
you better show me some identification,
go on, go on,
uh, this is a matter of extreme urgency,
in just two days' time, the garden will be destroyed,
what are you talking about, young man?
are you a practical joker like your grandfather?
this is no joke, Mr, Betameche,
a building contractor wants to flatten the land and build apartment blocks,
Ah! What are apartment blocks?
enormous houses built from concrete,
they will cover up all the gardens and stop the flowers from growing, That's awful!
the only way to prevent this is for me to find the treasure that my grandfather has hidden somewhere,
then I'll be able to pay off the contractor, and none of this will happen,
that's a really good idea, All's well that ends well, See ya,
No!
to do that, I need to pass into your world so I can start looking for the treasure,
that's not possible,
you can't make a journey just like that,
the council must first be assembled, then you must explain your problem to them, then we break for lunch
and in two days' time, the land will be flattened and you'll all be dead!
so you mean this is an emergency?
Yes, and we have to act now, because the future of your people is in your hands,
the future of the people lies in my hands?
someone might take me seriously,
Oh! It's okay, I landed on my hair,
you did well,
I hope it will be enough to convince them,
Oh, Betameche, I just got to sleep two and a half years ago, - What do you want? - I need you to activate the beam,
Oh, well, yes, Forgive me, Your Highness,
but I really am royalty,
you're a royal pain in my keister, is what you are,
hurry, The boy needs to see the king,
hurry, hurry, You know, when I was your age, we used to look to the moon to figure out the time, and we were always on time,
so now, here we go,
one for the body,
and we had respect for those who were asleep,
two for the spirit, Yes!
cracked my back, I needed that,
and one more for the soul to go-oo-oo!
what's happening to me?!
you are going to join our brothers, the Minimoys,
they will lead you to the Seven Kingdoms,
you only have 36 hours,
at noon on the day after tomorrow, the gateway will close again for 1, 000 days, 36 hours, I'll do my best,
good luck, Arthur,
the key, You have the key,
the key? Yeah, I have the key,
okay, now go over to the lock,
the lock,
that has to be it,
good, good, Now turn the key, - I'm gonna die! - Yes!
no, no, no, no, no!
welcome to the land of the Minimoys,
it's not funny, You really scared me,
I thought I was gonna die in that
that's incredible,
what's incredible?
I don't know, Just look at my clothes, They've changed,
you can admire yourself later, The council's waiting for you,
come on! Follow me!
all this excitement's made me sleepy,
how far have they gotten?
you're joking, They've only just started,
princess Selenia,
my little girl,
father!
sorry, sorry,
princess Selenia, may the spirits of the ancients guide you, - BETAMECHE: Papa!
yes?
Papa?
where are you? - Down here, It's me, Pops,
Ah, my son,
you did that on purpose, didn't you?
couldn't you have waited ten seconds before playing the clown?
I got something much more important here,
Oh! Because my mission isn't of great importance, is that it?
and don't tell me you're the chosen one, I've heard that speech,
enough! Stop bickering, the two of you,
both: Hm!
I hope you have good reason for daring to disrupt this important ceremony,
I do, Father, I have an upperlander with me, and he's just been Minimoyzed, - - Who is this uplander?
his name is Arthur, He's here to warn us of a grave misfortune, and the future of our people lies in
our great misfortune has a name--the Evil M
and we have no need of this Arthur person,
as the princess of royal blood, the task of protecting our people falls to me, - Hm! - Yes, but,
cupcake, - MAN: Will she make it?
it's moving,
I have it, I have it, I can feel it,
see, you totally sounded way too arogant,
while the princess gets her second wind, perhaps we should hear this young man, - Where does he come from? - Chicks dig the hair, - Oh, he's a dreamboat, - He's so hot, - He's cool, huh? - Ordinary, - My humble respects, Princess Selenia, - Who told him my name?
my humble respects, Princess Selenia,
my humble respects, Your Majesty, - Yes, my respects-- - Oh, Arthur!
I'm delighted to meet you,
I was a good friend of your grandfather Archibald,
miro, leave him alone, Well, young man, we're all ears,
it's like this: In just under two days, some men are gonna come and destroy my house, my garden, my world, and your world,
and you--all two-and-a-half millimeters of you
you've come to save us, is that it?
the only way to stop these men is to pay them off,
this is why my grandfather came to you three years ago,
he was looking for a treasure, and I've come to complete his mission,
your grandfather was a remarkable man,
he taught us so many things,
he was the one who showed Miro how to harness image and light,
then one day he left in search of his famous rubies which our brothers the Bogo Matassalai had given to him in thanks,
he had buried them in our lands for safekeeping, but as you might expect, when he needed to retrieve them, he couldn't find them,
after wandering through the seven lands which make up our world, he finally found it, deep in the heart of the city of Necropolis, where he reigns supreme
the Evil M,
and unfortunately, no one ever returns from the forbidden lands,
so
so, you still set on your big adventure?
my grandfather is not dead, I'm sure of that,
I will find him, and the treasure, even if I have to wrench it from the very clutches of this miserable Maltazard,
mamma mia!
there is someone outside, - It's lucky Gondolo, the mapmaker, - He doesn't look so lucky to me,
I think he needs a new nickname,
stop!
what's wrong, Arthur? - Sire, look over there,
it looks as if a piece is peeling off, I think it's a trap,
that's a painted canvas,
my grandfather used to do this in Africa to protect himself from wild animals,
well, we're not wild animals, and we're not gonna leave this unhappy creature to die,
here, make yourself useful,
Oh, my God, Gondolo,
Selenia,
Yes, Take it easy, Gondolo,
it's a trap,
Arthur: What are those?
Oh, my God! The Seides are back,
mosquitoes!
Arthur! - Close the gate!
charge!
get him! Go get him!
let's go! - Come on, men!
this is not a drill,
alley-oop!
chery on top!
ready to fire! - Time to make the jelly!
watch out! Ohh!
follow me to the palace!
hurry, Father!
Yes, yes, I'm coming,
Oh!
I'm so sorry, I'm so clumsy,
Ahem. Perfect timing, I rather fancy stretching my legs a little,
father, go and take cover quickly,
out of the question! It's a king's duty to face his destiny, and if only one person is left standing, I will be that person,
Arthur!
I might have an idea, - Great, Well, I'm all ears, - Take this, I'm gonna get my pets, - Your pets?
ha ha ha! Missed me!
this is not working,
gentlemen, it's time for a little reflection,
Ow!
Ow! Watch out! The walls are booby-trapped, Follow me,
that was for Gondolo,
okay, Romeo and Juliet are really tasty to mosquitoes,
you hold her, But nothing can beat their love for each other,
really hate to do this, but they can't stand to be apart,
when I blow my whistle, release your Romeo, -, so he can get back to his Juliet, - Okay,
let's go!
Oh, no, - Fire, - Ha ha ha! - Hi,
we're gonna have some fun,
welcome to a world of
Ow!
okay, here we go,
Ah!
come on!
this can't be more complicated than driving a car,
Whoa!
wait up!
look out!
Arthur, stop playing around, Get serious,
that's the signal, Fly off, little one,
no, you fool!
no, it's not feeding time!
no, not the gap! Not the gap!
okay, back in the saddle again,
that's it, I got it,
you just made the "X" list,
Yeah, that's better, Now let's go for it,
how brave he is, how heroic,
it's amazing how much he's just like me, He'd make a good partner for you,
father, I'm old enough to look after myself now,
forget it, forget it,
who's next in line?
Oh, no! - Oh, yes, - Betameche! - Arthur?
do something! - Hang on, Arthur, I'm coming,
what a gift he is,
come to think of it, he does remind me of you,
you okay? Nothing broken?
I'm not sure, I can't feel anything on my butt,
just one question: Where did you learn to fly like that?
driving with my grandfather, - That makes sense,
Ah, Mogoth, king me,
for being clueless, that went rather well,
hmm,
prepare to witness the wrath of Mogoth,
we're not leaving without the princess,
now, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,
or my way,
okay, guys, on three, - Why on three? - That's just how we do it, - Why not five? - Are you new here?
four of you attacking one woman! Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?
no, - Pick on someone your own size,
Never!
long live the king!
Oh, my daughter,
my child, I must do something, Cover me!
thank you,
the sword of power, - - You foolish child,
it's a miracle!
okay, that's enough now,
get on your knees and beg the princess for forgiveness,
Bruce?
Mordecai?
I said, on your knees and beg the princess,
we're sorry,
now you're sorry, huh? Sorry for what?
sorry for, you know, trying to kill you and everybody,
I'll think about it,
that's my daughter, just like her mother, - You fought like a prince, - Thanks,
this sword seems so light, It all seems so easy,
of course, it's a magic sword,
it's been embedded in that rock for years, and you're the one who released it, - Really? - Yes, my friend,
you're a hero now, Arthur the hero!
what's a hero?
BETAMECHE: Arthur the hero!
long live Arthur the hero!
long live Arthur the hero!
crowd: Long live Arthur the hero!
long live Arthur the hero!
father, now that the sword has been freed from the stone, we must act fast,
I would like your permission to continue my mission,
unfortunately, I have to agree with you, my child, but I must insist on one condition,
what condition is that?
Arthur is brave and his heart is pure,
he will go with you, If that is what you wish, Father,
well done, Arthur,
KlNG: I'm sure you're going to make a fine team,
the way is clear,
are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
I'm sure, Go ahead, let go,
Ohh!
father, do we really have to take Betameche with us?
even if your brother is still young, one day he will be older,
Arthur,
if you should encounter a small mole wearing glasses who answers to the name of Mino on your travels, he's my son,
he's been missing for some three months now,
you can count on me,
Oh, thank you, Arthur,
Hey, hero, let's go,
Hey, wait for me!
you could at least wait for me,
wait up! Your legs are longer,
I'm just a mini-Minimoy,
boy, I do hope they won't fall into any traps,
I slept like a rock,
Arthur, time to get up,
Selenia, I'm sorry I called you Princess Rude, okay?
can we slow down a bit? - No way,
it's your fault for loading yourself up like a gamallus,
I just packed a little bit of everything, You know, just in case, - What's a gamallus? - It's like a pachymollet, only much bigger, - And what is a pachymollet like? - Like that,
any chance you got something in your bag for dealing with pachymollets?
don't worry, I got my 300-function pocketknife here,
double knife, multi-crab clips, soap bubbles, music box, and for when things get really hot, a fan,
that's pretty handy, all right,
then you got all your classic functions like your tulipan, your matchet, your sunjink, whistler, gullybar,
nothing in there to cut off your tongue, by any chance?
no, But that's your specialty, isn't it?
stay right where you are,
run, On my signal,
now,
here we are,
BETAMECHE: Look at this place,
they built so much here, I can barely recognize anything,
anybody home?
not many people come through this way,
once you've tried it, you'll understand why, - Anybody home? - Excuse you,
Oh, no, I'm sorry, I mistook you for a bell,
I-I didn't realize you were actually alive,
Hey, hold on, ma che fai, stupido?
what do you think you're doin', knockin' out all my customers like that?
it's not as if I have so many to start with, - Hello, I am Princess Selenia, - I know that,
and that is your stupido brother,
and who is the third comedian who comes around knockin' out all the customers?
my name's Arthur, and I'm looking for my grandfather,
Ah, I transported your grandfather a few years ago, an old eccentric madman who absolutely insisted on being transported deep inside Seides territory,
the Necropolis,
that's him, that's my grandfather, and that's exactly where we wanna go, - Sold out, - Ah!
necropolis, sure, Why not the moon as well?
we didn't ask you for the moon, We asked for three tickets to Necropolis,
is that clear enough?
Arthur!
Arthur, You break my door to steal the key?
answer me, Arthur!
Oh, what a job, Right this way,
come on, keep it moving while we're young,
Yes, that's a leaf, Let's go, dandelion,
Hey, that ain't for decoration, You're gonna need it, Arrive derci, baby,
the car?
what's the car doing there?
necropolis, ohh, Oh, boy, here we go,
Ah, here it is,
Oh, wow! That's cool,
I got another one just like it in pink, Wanna see it?
beta, we've got enough light already,
Arthur,
Arthur: Where exactly are we heading?
we are here, and we're going here,
Oh, my gosh, I know where that is, That's right under the water tower,
giant water tank in the hands of that unspeakable piece of,
now I'm starting to understand, - Who are you talking about? - The most evil of evil,
Oh, Maltazard,
holy humpbacked gamallus,
didn't anyone ever teach you to hold your tongue?
I'm really sorry,
Arthur!!!
granny?
and we're off,
all: Ohh!
Arthur?
how long is the ride?
it's pretty short, as long as we can avoid any unpleasant encounters,
what do you mean by unpleasant encounters?
Arthur: Aah!
Whoa! I like it much better when it stops,
we're running out of time,
if we're gonna find those rubies, we need to get crackin',
water!
SELENlA: Do something, Arthur! Get us out of it!
it looks like you two are gonna have to get me out of this,
there's a hole in my boat,
Minimoys can't swim,
comin' to get ya, Be right there, - SELENlA: Arthur, please! - I'm coming, I'm coming,
I know this river,
first there's a bend to the right, then there's a sharp bend to the left,
Minimoys can't swim,
that would've been helpful information to know,
see, I didn't abandon you,
Oh, great, So instead of the two of us drowning, now all three of us can drown together,
no one's gonna drown, Selenia,
surely you're not gonna let a little river frighten you,
it's not the river that I'm frightened of, It's that!
Arthur, have you ever thrown a sword like that before?
it can't be much more difficult than playing darts,
Betameche
we choose to go to the moon.
we choose to go to the moon.
we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things...
not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
look at that. - That's beautiful.
it's gotta be one of the most proud moments of my life. I guarantee ya.
for most of human history, a voyage to the moon was the fantasy of the addlebrained or foolhardy...
for only divine beings and supermen could make the journey.
but then humans went aloft on mechanical wings defying gravity and redefining the realm of possibility...
and the moon was within the grasp of whoever would build the machine to take them there.
the main requirement for making the fantasy a fact? Perseverance.
the wherewithal to solve the problems one by one over the long course of the endeavor.
problems such as how to make that first exploratory leap into the lifeless void of outer space.
for without surviving that, no one would ever dare make the foolhardy, yet divine, voyage from the Earth to the moon.
what do you do here at the base, sir? - I'm an astronaut.
are you one of the seven astronauts that have been chosen?
that's right. I'm one of the seven.
they're gonna shoot me out into space, into the blue.
up above buildings!
now, sir, just one moment. One moment.
sure. I'm a little nervous. I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my life.
sir, may I ask you something? - Sure.
I saw the pictures of the seven astronauts that appeared in Life.
you saw those pictures, yeah. - You are not among them.
none of them are them.
you mean, those are not the real? - No, those are models.
you see, they can't take pictures of us. We're monkeys, man.
what do you mean, you're monkeys? - Let me explain something.
those are seven handsome men. - See, they're beautiful.
they take pictures of them, so that we're not ashamed for Russia to show such ugly little astronauts!
you're not a very good-looking man. - No, I'm a monkey!
sir, I'm a little disturbed that they're sending you up to be the first man in space.
you seem ill-equipped to be an astronaut.
what do you mean? I got gloves and everything.
there is historic news from behind the Iron Curtain.
man has traversed the reaches of outer space, and that man is a Communist.
soviet pilot Yury Gagarin in the spacecraft Vostok l...
successfully lifted off the face of the Earth...
flew his craft around the globe in approximately 90 minutes...
and landed safely in the Soviet Union.
as with the flight of Sputnik four years ago...
this latest Russian achievement has caught those in the American space program by surprise.
the seven American astronauts of the Mercury space program...
suddenly find themselves jockeying for second place.
it has been reported that either Gus Grissom...John Glenn or Alan B. Shepard will be the first to fly the one-man Mercury space capsule.
just when the flight will take place has been the subject of much speculation.
tonight President Kennedy is meeting with officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration...
to discuss not just why we are losing the space race...
but perhaps if it has already been lost.
the Russian went into orbit. - One orbit, yes.
we can't even match that.
not yet.
gentlemen.
president has been keeping up with your hearings before Congress and committees.
for the purpose of tonight's meeting, we can dispense with small talk.
he will want to know how we can catch the Russians...or better yet, leapfrog them.
we can put a man on the moon before the Russians. How about that?
it'll take a concerted national effort.
something along the lines of the Manhattan Project.
how much would it cost?
somewhere between $10 billion and $20 billion.
pumping that much cash into the private sector could be popular.
he will ask if there's anything we can do for less of the taxpayers' dollars.
what if we put up a space laboratory of some kind?
they'll beat us.
if we get into a race with them over heavy lifting capabilities...
which is all that putting up a space station will demonstrate we're going to lose for at least the next five years.
Hugh, were you as sure about this when you were working under Eisenhower?
no, but the Soviets hadn't put a man in space then.
most assuredly, the moon is their ultimate objective.
red moon, huh? Who wants that hangin' over our heads?
as head of the president's science advisory...
I've gotta tell him that politics aside...
there's no reason to put a man on the moon.
the only thing we'll get for our money is some rocks.
so, put a probe up, scoop some out, bring 'em back...
and tour the world with them for propaganda purposes.
you don't need to send a man a quarter of a million miles away to do that.
and it sure as hell won't cost $20 billion.
well, certainly the president realizes the moment a man steps on the moon will be a definitive one in the history of the world.
especially when he sticks Old Glory in it and salutes.
he's ready for us.
can the president count on anything in the immediate future?
Yes, the second of May. We'll have an American up on the second of May.

Mr. Webb, Dr. Gilruth is here.
Bob. - Hey.
he's just gettin' into it now.
good. Can you turn it up, please, Jim?
their large rocket engines which gives them many months of lead time...
and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit...
this lead sometime to come...
in still more impressive success.
we, nevertheless, are required to make new efforts on our own.
for, while we cannot guarantee that we shall one day be first...
we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make us last.
I therefore ask the Congress...beyond the increases I have earlier requested for space activities to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following national goals.
first, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.
there can be no space project in this period...
that will be more impressive to mankind...
or more important for the long-range exploration of space...
and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.
whoa, buster. - They sure didn't waste any time.
if we had gotten Shepard into space before Gagarin, it'd be over.
we'd have beaten them. That would have been that.
we wouldn't be talkin' about goin' to the moon for another 20 years.
between this and the Bay of Pigs
does anybody want my job?
that five-page memo from L. B.J...
pressing us to do it by 1967.
before we get anywhere near the moon...
we'll need to put thousands of man-hours into space.
so far we got 15 minutes and 22 seconds.
I'm serious now. Who here wants my job?
Bob, can we do this?
we'll need thousands of people...
special facilities...
technology and material that haven't been invented yet.
Yeah.
can we do it?
put a man on the moon in nine years.
Yes.
Absolutely.
we have to.
damn.
all right, here's what we're gonna have to do, folks...to get a man to the moon ahead of the Soviets.
we've all been planning, meeting, talking, dreaming, but here is the brass tacks...
so we're all on the same page.
to get a man to the moon, we first have to get him into orbit.
our friends from Russia already did that. Good for them.
popgun shot with Al Shepard was a nice start.
but we all know we don't get cigars for that one.
the Mercury flights comin' up will get us into orbit...
long enough for us to figure out how to stay up there for a bit.
we do that, we have objective number one made.
Eva, space walk.
objective number two.
once in orbit, we get out of the spacecraft. Go for a walk.
see if we can build a suit to protect a man outside.
see if he can maneuver, see if he can get back in.
we need this for emergencies, of course...
but we ain't goin' to the moon to sit inside and take pictures.
we're gonna walk around up there.
we'll need the equipment to allow a man to do that.
rendezvous.
two spacecraft meetin' up in orbit.
you wanna have fun? Come over to my house.
you stand in the backyard. I'll stand in the front yard.
you throw a tennis ball over my roof.
I'll try to hit it with a rock as it comes sailin' over.
that's what we're going to have to do.
two spacecraft flyin' at 5 miles a second hundreds of miles up...
with a communication system spread all over the world...
like so many tradin' stamps.
then...
we're gonna have to dock.
join up.
develop the specs and hardware for two spacecraft to first rendezvous...
then to come together all safe and stable.
objective 5: long duration spaceflight.
take two weeks to fly to the moon and back.
what is being in zero "G" that long gonna do to the human body?
will the crews' hearts stop beating?
will they be able to take a crap without foulin' up the flight controls?
I'm bettin' they can.
still we need to prove it.
we need to prove them all proficiently over and over again.
we have to get so good at it...
that we bet the lives of our crews without flinching.
we get 'em up there. We accomplish the mission objectives...
and we get them back home every time.
Oh, there's one more thing.
you know those daring, dashing young throttle jockeys who call themselves astronauts?
well, we're gonna need a whole bunch of new ones.
my name's Max Peck.
I believe you've got a room for me.
Yes, Mr. Peck. We've been expecting you.
Howdy.
I'm Max Peck, and I need a room.
of course, Mr. Peck, and we've been holding one for you.
good afternoon. I'm Max Peck.
Mr. Peck, of course.
Hi. I have a reservation for a single room. My name is Max Peck.
you're who?
Mr. Max Peck.
I don't think so.
no, really.
Yep, that's me. Good old Max Peck.
I'll handle this one, Sheila. Mr. Peck, how nice to see you.
I believe you're expected in the Corral Room up in the Mezzanine.
you guys are drinkin' in bad company if Pete Conrad's buyin'.
good God, not Jim Lovell.
space program isn't safe if shaky here can pass muster.
good to see ya, Pete. - Jim, come on in.
Hi, Jim Lovell. - Ed White.
here's Jim McDivitt. - Hello, Jim.
it's a pleasure. - Elliott See.
pleasure. - Nice to meet ya.
it's Frank Borman. - Hello, Frank.
Tom Stafford, John Young. - Nice to meet ya.
what's the point of havin' top-secret code names if we ain't gonna use 'em?
well, heck, what'd I say, Jim Lovell? I meant Max Peck.
makes a lot more sense. - Nice to meet ya.
so I say, "Who is it?" She says, "He won't say.
I say, "Well, ask again." She says, "I did.
he was sure it was Dialin' For Dollars.
well, I get to the phone, and it's
Jim, this is Deke Slayton. Would you be interested in flyin' for us?
I said, "Well, Deke, let me think about that. Yes.
Yeah, how soon do you want me? - Exactly.
think about it. He's in training for his Mercury mission.
yanked from the flight line. Boom. Just like that he's grounded.
Yeah, well, some doctor had a piece of paper saying...
Deke Slayton shouldn't fly because of something called heart fibrillations.
doesn't everybody's heart fibrillate?
I'm guessin' it'll be a variation on military rotation for Gemini.
you know, you back up prime crew.
you skip a couple of flights and then end up prime yourself.
gettin' on that rotation in the first place? That's the trick.
the original seven's gonna fly way before any of us new nine.
so, now, Deke Slayton's runnin' the office. Carpenter's history.
John Glenn's leaving NASA. He's gonna run for president someday, I think.
if he leaves, he's got my vote.
I don't know. What do ya think? Will Glenn be satisfied with just president?
let's ask Armstrong.
Hey, Neil, would you vote for John Glenn for president?
glenn for president, huh?
that would depend. Who'd be runnin' for king?
a great leader is dead.
a great nation must move on.
and as we bow our heads in submission to divine providence...
let us also thank God...
for the years that He gave us inspiration through His servant, John F. Kennedy.
and to honor his memory and the future of the works that he started...
I have today determined that Station Number One of the Atlantic Missile Range and the NASA Launch Operation Center in Florida shall hereafter be known as the John F. Kennedy Space Center.
if there is a word that expresses the Washington reaction to the Russian space spectacular today, the word is admiration.
the actual getting out of the capsule itself was more or less the next thing to happen.
a more accurate word might be envy.
soviet scientists are talking now in terms of landing a man on the moon.
it was going to happen sooner or later. It was just a question of when.
the Russians started ahead of us in space ventures. They have been ahead.
what they did today proves they are still ahead.
the Gemini capsule would certainly be equipped to perform the same type
on the fourth flight, which could come late this year...
one of the American pilots will step outside.
extravehicular activity!
that's just a fancy way of saying, "Let's go outside for a walk.
the trouble is, it's cold out in space.
see? Even chilly. Freezing!
and, there is no air to breathe out here.
that's right, Woody. If Americans are ever to walk on the moon...
the deadly vacuum of space must first be conquered.
captain See? - Captain's not necessary.
I'm a civilian.
we're having our P. T.A. book fair on the 22nd.
we would love it if NASA could arrange another astronaut visit.
I'd be happy to pass this along to the Pubic Affairs Office.
when I told the kids Astronaut Elliott See was coming, they all said, "Who?
they think every astronaut is John Glenn.
but I'm sure they will be glued to the TV when you make your space shunt.
with such a suit, why, anyone could take a walk in space...
or even a walk on the moon.
there you are, snug as a bug in a rug
for a penguin, I mean.
Hey, where are you goin'?
my suit's at 3. 5 p. s.i. and holding.
great.
Yeah, mine's just about the same.
all right, you dirty dog, ready to go ahead and finish with the cabin depress?
Yeah, I'm ready. - All right. Let's go.
Hawaii, Houston Flight. - Go, Flight.
tell him we're ready to have him come out when he is.
Roger. Understand.
delta, give us a mark. - Gemini Four, CAPCOM.
come on out, Ed. Make us all look good.
Gemini Four, CAPCOM. You are good for EVA on your mark.
okay, I'm separating from the spacecraft.
okay, my feet are out.
I think I'm draggin' a little bit, but I don't wanna fire the gun yet.
okay, I put a little roll in there. It took me right out.
am I in your view, Jimbo? - Ed, I can't see through the window.
don't sweat it. I'm comin' over to you.
there goes what looks like a thermal glove.
that's what it is, Ed. - All right.
I'm comin' above the spacecraft now.
it looks like we're comin' up on the coast of California.
I'm under my own control.
there's no disorientation associated with it. None.
okay, I'm kickin' down underneath the spacecraft.
it's all very soft.
particularly as long as you move nice and slow.
I feel very thankful to have the experience to be doin' this.
you look beautiful, Ed. - I feel like a million dollars.
Gemini Four, Houston CAPCOM.
Gemini Four, Houston CAPCOM.
just for the record, Flight, he's been out twice as long as Leonov.
very good. They're runnin' out of daylight up there.
capcom, let's get him back in now.
I don't know exactly where we are, but it looks like we're back over Texas again.
as a matter of fact, yeah, that looks a lot like Houston down there.
Hey, Gus, I don't know if you read, but we're over Houston.
why don't you run out and take a look?
Yeah, that's Galveston Bay right there.
I could stay out here all day.
let's see what the Flight Director says.
flight Director says get back in.
tell that son of a bitch to get back in.
Gemini Four, Houston.
Gus, this is Jim. Do you got any message for us?
Gemini Four, get back in. - Okay.
ed, Houston wants you to come back in.
back in? - Roger that.
been talkin' for a while.
comin' in.
this is the saddest moment of my life.
all right.
ladies and gentlemen, Commander Roger Chaffee...
is from the third class of brand-new astronauts.
he's flown in special from Houston to tell us all how America is gonna beat the Russians to the moon.
who the hell is Roger Chaffee?
I came to see a real astronaut. - He's an astronaut.
he just hasn't been up yet.
he ain't flown outer space yet. He ain't no astronaut.
thank you very much.
ed White's extravehicular activity cleared a major hurdle.
man can work in the vacuum of outer space...
and in a few years, on the surface of the moon.
just last December, Borman and Lovell in Gemini 7 were met in orbit by Tom Stafford and Wally Schirra of Gemini 6.
but what they didn't do was literally link up or dock.
this NASA has yet to accomplish.
to do that, we have to develop a special docking mechanism which we have here in diagram form.
you know, I
I brought along someone who I think can explain all of this...
one heck of a lot better than I can.
blastoff!
that's good.
I just remembered. I'm allergic to cheese.
now comes the hard part: getting back home.
the lunar lander will fly up from the moon...
and have to not only find the orbiting capsule...
but actually grab onto it.
howdy, fuzz! - Hey! Hello!
and home we go!
this is Emmett Seaborn with a special bulletin from St. Louis.
american astronauts Elliott See and Charles Bassett have died in a crash of their T-38 jet aircraft.
the Gemini astronauts were flying to Lambert Field...
to inspect their space capsule at the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation...
when the plane carrying the two astronauts smashed into the roof of the assembly plant.
as crew of Gemini 9...
the pair were to have flown into space in early June.
they tried to keep the field in view... -Give us a second, will you?
while doing a turnaround under the cloud ceiling and overshot the runway.
elliott tried to land V. F.R. under that low overcast.
he hit the building and smashed into the park.
of the plant where the spacecraft was being assembled. Good God!
it's a miracle more people weren't killed.
does that mean we're pushin' too hard...
with our guys flyin' all over the country in bad weather?
these are pilots who have to fly through a lot worse than overcast skies.
it was an accident.
two astronauts who hadn't even been in space yet are dead.
you don't think Congress is gonna ask me how somethin' like that happened?
they'll slow us down, cancel missions, just so they can look good.
this is the first time a backup crew is going to be going into space.
are Stafford and Cernan gonna be ready for Gemini 9?
this is exactly why we have backup crews. Gene and Tom will be ready.
there are gonna be two very public funerals.
after which, the press is gonna have a field day...
about NASA wasting not just tax dollars but human lives.
still, we dodged a bullet.
if See and Bassett had been killed during an actual space mission?
congress would shut NASA down and Russia gets to the moon in a cakewalk.
we have Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott going up in Gemini 8 in two weeks.
there is no reason-- none-- to slip the launch.
we have to rendezvous and dock with Agena, otherwise we are way behind.
all right.
we go on just as we have to.
I'll fight it out with whoever tries to close us down in Washington...
if for no other reason then to buy time...
time to rack up a couple of successful missions...
so no one has anything to complain about.
but at the same time, gentlemen, let's all say some prayers...
for nothing else to go wrong.
bus arm to dock.
eight, CAPCOM, we copy.
C. D.A. Control, switch is off. Agena docking light is green.
Agena power light is green.
Gemini 8, we have telemetry solid.
lookin' good on the ground. You're still go for docking.
okay, contact light. We have capture and rigidizing.
flight, we are docked with the Agena. It was really a smoothy.
Roger, Dave.
Hey, congratulations. This is real good.
you can't have the thrill down there that we have up here.
we have you at loss of signal in 10 seconds.
we'll acquire over C. S.Q. - Very good.
the letters L. O.S. stand for "Loss Of Signal.
armstrong and Scott are going to be out of communication...as Gemini travels from the tracking station toward the one on board the ship, Coastal Sentry Quebec or C. S.Q.
where are they now, Armstrong and Scott?
it looks as if they're just below the coast of India, crossing over.
Neil, we're rollin'. We're in a bank.
plus 30 degrees. What the hell is this?
we shouldn't be moving like this.
I don't get it. I can't control it. Shut down the Agena.
I did. Command 400.
it's down.
then what the hell is this?
our rate is pickin' up. It's just gettin' worse.
let's hope it's somethin' wrong with the Agena.
we better disengage.
you ready?
Yes, sir. - Undock.
Hey, Deke! - Hey, Pete.
better get in here and do some work.
work. I heard of that. Spelled with a "W," isn't it?
I can't stop it. Wanna give it a try? - I got it.
man, what is this?
Gemini 8, C. S.Q. CAPCOM, how do you-- - We have serious problems here.
we're tumbling end over end.
we've separated from the Agena.
we're rolling up, and we can't turn anything off.
we are continuously increasing left roll.
C. S.Q. Flight. - Go ahead, Flight.
did he say he could not turn the Agena off?
no, he said that he separated from the Agena...
and is in a roll and he can't stop it.
his reg pressure is down to zero. Gemini 8, C. S.Q.
we are in a violent left roll here.
we can't turn the oams off, and we can't fire them.
one of the oams has got to be stuck on. -I'm isolating the attitude system.
I'm shuttin' it down.
did I hear a stuck hand controller? - That's affirmative, Flight.
we can't seem to get any valid data here. They're in a violent tumble.
what about the Agena? - Flight Surgeon!
go ahead.
that roll's too violent, there's a danger of tunnel vision...
with the possibility of blacking out.
we can't take much more of this.
not it. All we have left is the reentry control system, Dave.
we bring up the RCS, they'll abort the mission.
not much choice here.
good. You're bringin' it down.
we're regaining control of the spacecraft slowly on RCS direct.
Roger, Captain.
we're pulsing the RCS slowly here, tryin' to kill our roll rate.
understand, Gemini. We show you maneuvering on your RCS. Affirmative.
all right, if they've brought up the RCS, then the flight's over.
that's mission rules. We gotta bring them in.
Gemini 8, C. S.Q. How much RCS have you used and are you just on one ring?
we are on one ring, trying to save the other ring.
we started out on two rings, but we are now on one ring.
and the RCS? - Doesn't matter. End of story.
we bring 'em in.
what about the RCS, Houston? - We're down to about 1, 700 pounds
recovery, are you getting all this? - Roger.
C. S.Q. Flight. Let's get that spacecraft sea-band beacon on.
reentry sea-band beacon on.
we've lost contact with the spacecraft, Flight.
okay. We'll get 'em over Hawaii. - Let's hope so.
the reentry guidance program isn't in the computer...
so Dave will have to manually enter the pad, then verify the self-tests with us.
they can't do that and get secure in one orbit. They need some time.
all right? - Right.
two passes over Rose Knot Victor, then. They're the secondary recovery zones.
let's bring them down in 7-3.
Na-ha Rescue 1, Gemini 8.
they ain't out there.
three- to five-foot waves, sure.
they didn't say anything about these swells.
the fumes from the heat shield really helped.
you think they even know we're here, Neil?
not to worry, Dave. If nothing else, we'll just float along to China.
Oh, God, give me that bag.
Na-ha Rescue 1, this is Gemini 8.
Neil Armstrong did everything a pilot should.
he probably saved the space program in the process.
but I want a Mercury veteran to fly the first Apollo mission, Gus.
it's simple as that. A brand-new spacecraft.
who'd be the choices for my crew? I want the best, Deke.
I was thinkin' of Donn Eisele, but then he went and broke his shoulder in the vomit comet, so
what about Ed White? -Eddie? I'll take him. Who else you got?
I'm impressed with Roger Chaffee.
he flew photo missions over Cuba during the missile crisis.
he's smart too.
wears down the engineers when he starts talkin' about their systems.
and there's one last thing, Gus, about the rotation.
we won't know the flight schedule for some time.
but I'd sure like to have one of the original Mercury astronauts...
still flying when Apollo makes that first moon landing.
interesting you should say that, Deke.
just so happens, I'm one of the original Mercury astronauts.
the Russians?
Roger Chaffee is a rookie astronaut chosen out of a field literally of thousands.
ed White is a veteran astronaut.
he's made our first space walk back on Gemini 4.
Gus Grissom, the Apollo 1 commander, has already flown...
both Mercury and Gemini spacecraft.
this three-man crew and the engineers are well into the development and training phase of Apollo procedures and hardware.
we are winning the space race.
we have not only caught up with the Soviets...
we have surpassed them in many areas.
we have kept men in space longer.
we have achieved orbital rendezvous of two spacecraft and the docking of two vehicles in orbit.
these are not only firsts in their own right...
but important steps to our long-range goal of landing on the moon with the Apollo program.
miss Hedges, a follow-up.
should the Russians beat us to the moon, Mr. Webb...
will the costly Apollo program be continued?
landing the first man on the moon is the priority of NASA...
and the American taxpayers who are footing the bill.
I do not see their support wavering until we do so.
Gavin O'Rourke.
Mr. Webb, NASA achievements and taxpayer will aside...
are we gonna beat the Russians in this contest?
will the United States put the first man on the moon?
it is my job and the job of 400, 000 men and women around the country to see to it that we do.
we have ignition.
we have liftoff.
and liftoff!
there it is!
america is one step closer to the moon with the launch of Gemini 12.
flight Commander Jim Lovell is a veteran astronaut.
pilot Edwin Aldrin makes his first journey into space.
from Houston, Science Editor Emmett Seaborn.
in one of the luckiest coincidences of this space program...
edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, who had worked on orbital rendezvous...
for his doctoral thesis at M. I.T...was seated in the right-hand seat of Gemini 12...
when the onboard computer refused to accept data from the rendezvous radar.
using an 8-power sexton and charts...
developed in the case of just such a malfunction...
aldrin guided Commander Jim Lovell to a successful rendezvous and docking with the Agena target vehicle.
this was an important moment for NASA...
as it proves the skills honed during the 10 Gemini missions can overcome potentially catastrophic problems...problems that could arise on a flight as crammed as Gemini 12.
in four days, the crew is expected to dock twice more with the Agena using its rocket engine...
to send them into an even higher orbit around the Earth.
three space walks...
Dr. Rendezvous himself Buzz Aldrin will perform experiments...
photograph star fields...
and remain outside the capsule longer than any astronaut to date...
using modified handrails and equipment specifically designed for work in zero gravity.
for Lovell, who will remain inside the spacecraft...
these four days of orbiting the Earth...
together with the 14 days aboard Gemini 7...
will make him the most traveled man in history.
Jimbo, gonna clean your windshield.
Hey, Buzz, check the oil too, would ya?
and so the curtain rings down on this second act of man's voyage to the moon.
nasa officials are confident that the third act-- Project Apollo will place a human being in the form of an American astronaut on the moon sometime before midnight...New Year's Eve, 1969.
from Houston, I'm Emmett Seaborn.
good morning. - How ya doin'?
some crowd, huh?
they all think you're gonna announce your return to the flight rotation.
you can announce mine while you're at it.
at least I can teach a couple of 'em. - Yes, you could.
Owen Maynard and the Mission Operations Division has laid out a plan for the series of Apollo flights that will lead up to the landing on the moon.
each of these missions has a letter.
the "A" and "B" missions will be unmanned tests.
the "C" mission will be the first manned flight of the command and service module.
Gus, Ed and Roger in Apollo 1.
the "D" mission will be the first dual flight of the C. S.M. with the lunar module in low Earth orbit to test it out.
the "E" mission will do the same in high Earth orbit for reentry procedures.
the "F" mission will go all the way to lunar orbit with the LEM but won't land.
that will be the objective of whoever takes the first "G" mission.
now, each of these missions must be successfully completed before we can move on to the next type of mission.
if we have problems with the rendezvous radar...
or the backpacks or the retracting probe...
we will go to a D-1 or a D-2 or even a D-3 mission...
before we attempt the first "E" mission.
so, even though there are only five manned missions laid out...
it does not necessarily mean that the fifth group will make the first landing...
which brings me to the point of this meeting.
assembled here are those of you that are left from the original seven Mercury astronauts...
as well as the new nine or the next nine...
or whatever you guys call yourselves...
and some of the third group.
the crew assignments that will be made concern you in the following manner.
the men in this room will be making moon landings.
two of you will be first.
I don't know which two that will be.
but I do know that the first man to walk on the moon walked into this room today and he's looking at me right now...
as well as the second...
the third and the fourth and so on.
just thought you might wanna know that.
that is all, gentlemen.
in the weeks leading up to any manned space mission...
the crew and the spacecraft are put through a series of dress rehearsals...
each one more like the real thing than the last.
the "plugs out" test is just one of these.
the crew is wearing full pressure suits locked inside the hatch...
confirming that the spacecraft can operate under its own power with all the umbilical plugs connecting it to the ground removed.
even for the very first Apollo mission...
the plugs out test was routine and hardly considered hazardous.
for astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee...
it was supposed to be just another long afternoon spent on their backs inside the Apollo 1 command module.
another test of the complicated vehicle that would someday perhaps take all three of them on a voyage from the Earth to the moon.
okay, Command Pilot, how do you read?
I read you loud and clear.
read me?
you're pretty garbled here, Gus.
senior Pilot, can you hear us?
Yeah, coming through loud and clear.
okay, Ed, you're worse than Gus. How 'bout you, Roger?
okay, pilot reads you five by five.
Roger, you are just a little bit better.
better than Ed or better than Gus?
better than both.
that's what I always say.
Gus, what we'd like to do is use strictly S-band communications.
see if we can clear this up.
can we get all three of you in the S-band mode?
we're all now in the S-band.
that's real clean, Gus.
let's try one more and maybe we can make the run.
okay. This is the command pilot.
one, two, three, four, five.
you're garbled, but I think we can get through like this.
senior Pilot, one more time, please.
Roger. Senior pilot's transmitting.
one, two, three, four.
I have senior pilot.
we're not copying anybody five by.
we've tried about every mode.
we never did hear the pilot.
pilot hasn't talked yet. How's this?
one, two, three, four, five.
okay, roger. You're all comin' in about the same.
bear with us, because sometimes we don't get your transmissions.
okay, SDC.
if you run into many more communications problems-- We're down. Copy?
Steve, I need you at the phone.
I didn't read you, Chuck, at all.
I can't read you, Chuck. Wanna try the phone?
how are we gonna get to the moon if we can't talk between three buildings?
didn't read you. Can you repeat?
I can't hear a thing they're saying. Jesus Christ.
I said, how are we gonna get to the moon...
if we can't talk between two or three buildings?
okay, that's a little better, Chuck. - Give us a count on black-three.
we'll try to figure out why you're coming in on black-two.
okay. You want us to sit by here till we get this stuff squared away?
uh, Chuck, I didn't read
test countdown hold continues at T minus ten.
Apollo 1, how do you read?
Apollo 1, how do you read?
I read you fine. The problem is you're not reading me.
we're gonna get a new backup system.
I sent a guy out for a couple of empty soup cans and some string.
a lot of string.
really getting ridiculous.
sounds like we got an open mike.
we better find it. - Fire!
we got a fire in the cockpit!
did he say "fire"? - On the monitor!
we got a bad fire!
we keeping you from something, Stormy?
Rick's rehearsal dinner. I promised Phyllis I wouldn't be late.
sure she's never heard that before.
control is on the line from the Cape. There's a fire in the spacecraft.
Mr. Shea, I was just trying the house.
I thought you were going straight home from the airport.
I have a couple of things I still need to take a look at.
mission Control just called. There's some situation with the test.
they wanted you to come over right away.
what kind of situation?
Chris. What's goin' on?
we lost the crew.
there was a fire. The crew is
they're dead.
jan.
would you like a sedative, Betty?
something-- - No, thank you.
I've got a lot of important decisions to make in the next few days.
I don't wanna be zonked out on pills.
better go call Gus' folks.
Martha, Mike Collins is here.
just so you know, Joe...
the suits failed but they
the doctors said they didn't burn to death.
it was the smoke.
they were asphyxiated.
Hello? Anybody home?
mom? Dad?
could have been any of us in there.
hell, it almost was me.
I was gonna sit in the spacecraft for the test.
either me or Joe. - What?
we'd been havin' so many problems with the communications system...
we thought it might be a good idea to have somebody in there listening in.
so up until breakfast this mornin'...
Joe Shea and I were gonna flip a coin to see who got to ride with the guys.
where would we sit? - Not on my lap, that's for damn sure.
we could fit one person across the cabin underneath the foot rail.
whichever one of us is going in there...
we'll be able to hear what you fellas are hearing.
which won't be much.
approximately.
Approximately?
we can't patch you into the cabin comm lines.
we'd have to run a separate line through the hatch.
then the hatch would have to be open. That's not gonna work.
we decided that if we weren't gonna hear exactly what they were hearing...
there really wasn't much point.
hell, we've been doin' that test since Mercury, Frank.
Joe flew back to Houston and I went for the pad.
don't really know why I went out there with the guys.
I usually don't.
think I just really wanted to ride in the spacecraft.
at least see what it was like to ride the test out up there.
but, anyway.
I'm kinda concerned about Joe.
I saw him up at the tower...
but I don't know how he's handling it.
how are you handling it?
I'm drunk.
the thing is
you and I...
we both know that people die testing unproved aircraft.
happens all the time.
it's not nice and we don't like it...
but we all knew it'd happen someday.
no, Deke.
we all knew it'd happen someday in space.
it's one thing to die on a mission.
it's another to die on the pad during a routine goddamn test.
senator Mondale's thoughts are with the families of these three brave Americans
.
that's it.
that's it for now.
seen the Times? Listen to this.
the astronauts were badly burned.
rescue workers needed five hours to remove their bodies.
I always knew this was a waste of money.
turns out it's a dangerous waste of money.
for five, six years, they've been spending money hand over fist.
no one's been able to do anything about it. Until now.
we're going to look into this. - I talked to Anderson's office.
he wants to wait until NASA's finished its own
its own investigation? For Christ's sake!
that's the fox guarding the henhouse! It'll be a complete and utter whitewash.
they don't like NASA employees investigating NASA.
as far as I'm concerned...
I didn't come here from Langley to put a good face on this for my employers.
the way I see it, while we're doing this...
we're not working for NASA.
we're working for Gus and Ed and Roger.
you're each gonna head up a panel or two.
Max, I want you to go over all the data that came out of the spacecraft.
printouts, voice transmissions, everything.
pin down the precise sequence of events.
we're going to have one panel focusing squarely on the fire.
how it started, how it spread. They'll be reporting to Dr. Robert Van Dolah...
of the Bureau of Mines Explosives Research Center.
I want you to head up the panel responsible for dismantling the spacecraft.
sorry I'm late.
got a call from Joe Shea.
stormy, he had a good idea.
if they're gonna use spacecraft 14 as a model for taking apart 12...
before they remove a screw from 12...
they'll try it out first on 14.
fine.
we're gonna help them any way we can. - I know.
but we've also gotta get the block twos ready to fly.
anything else?
do you think they're gonna try to nail us for this?
how can they nail us, Bud? It wasn't our fault.
we were gonna run an emergency egress test at the end of the plugs out.
see how fast they could get out of there.
how far did Ed manage to turn the latch handle?
we don't know.
even if he'd managed to turn the handle all the way
he still never would have gotten out. It's an inward opening hatch.
as strong as Ed was, the pressure in the cabin from the fire and the smoke...
would have been too much for him to pull against.
you know what haunts me?
in a way, if it wasn't for me...
the fire might not have been fatal.
why is that?
the capsules in the Mercury program had explosive hatches, right?
you pull a lever and bam, you're outta there in a second.
remember when Gus' capsule sank...
and everyone said he must have blown the hatch by accident?
I was on the review board for that.
I was the one who found out Gus was telling the truth.
the hatch could blow by itself.
it was because of that they decided not to use an explosive hatch with Apollo.
nice irony, huh?
if I hadn't proved Gus right...
we might have had an explosive hatch on this spacecraft...
in which case, Gus and the boys would still be alive and well.
I'm not a big fan of irony.
got a bad fire!
got a bad fire!
I'm going now, Mr. Shea. Is there anything I can get you?
you believe in time travel, Kathy?
I mean, if you could go back in time.
what would you do?
I mean, I'd be on that spacecraft for the test.
that's where I'd be.
good night, sir.
next is TPS4CM183.
item 1018. Panel 209 mount: upper right.
panel 209 mount: upper right.
counterclockwise rotation. Twenty-two pounds torque.
release at 22. 5.
confirmed. Panel 209 mount: upper right.
threading intact. No visible marking.
22. 5. Noted.
hold on. I think you're gonna want to see this.
it's a socket wrench.
we found it behind the panel door.
must have been left there by one of the North American workmen.
there's no other reasonable explanation for it.
socket wrench?
did it have anything to do with the fire?
we haven't finished our analysis, but I'd have to say no.
that's a long way away from where we think that fire started.
but it still shouldn't have been there, should it?
no, sir.
I think we better hear what North American has to say.
gentlemen.
this is off the record.
first off, I want to thank Stormy and Joe for coming to talk to us.
we're going to be writing this report in the next three weeks...
and we have some questions for you that might help us clear some things up.
stormy, let's start with you.
I'm sure you've seen this. - Yes, I've seen that.
leaving that wrench in those wires was careless and sloppy.
when we find the person responsible...
we're going to make our displeasure known in the strongest possible way.
but we all know that that wrench had absolutely nothing to do with the fire.
a number of people have told me Gus wasn't happy with North American.
when he made suggestions or had complaints...
he didn't think he was being listened to.
we listened at first.
but after a while, we had to stop listening.
the good old days of Mercury and Gemini are gone.
on Gemini, if you wanted to make a change in the spacecraft...
all you had to do was call up old man McDonnell.
right? Well, you can't do that on Apollo. You know that.
the smallest change has huge ramifications.
mercury missions. You launched, orbited, came back down.
hell, you could hold your breath through some of those flights.
we're going to the moon now.
so if the accusation is we haven't done everything...
that you astronauts have asked us to do...
all I can say is, "Guilty as charged!
no one's accusing you of anything. This isn't a court of law.
you're damn right. It's an ambush!
you say you've got questions for Joe and me.
why do I think there aren't gonna be too many questions for Joe?
because if you don't have any, I've got a couple.
you wanna tell them the real reason for the wiring problems?
how NASA keeps changing mission requirements...
yet you push us to meet these arbitrary deadlines.
we never made changes regarding Velcro.
what?
there was not supposed to be more than 500 square inches of it in the cabin.
you guys had over 5, 000 square inches in there.
I wasn't aware that was a problem. - Of course you were aware!
we talked about it last August.
you guys got any other complaints?
no steering wheel, huh?
how about the tinted windows, maybe some power steering?
no, no problem.
we do have a couple of other things before we can take off.
check the fine print. There's no warranty on this vehicle.
as soon as we signed the pink slip over, it was yours.
caveat emptor, buddy. - No, it's the Velcro.
it's flammable and there's too much of it inside. How did this happen?
talk to them. They're the ones who put it there.
when you get up in zero "G," crap starts floating around.
but put a little on your pen and on the bulkhead and, presto.
then maybe there's just a few too many bits of it in there.
so wherever Velcro is...
there should be at least four inches between it and any ignition source.
sure. Yeah.
other than that
not one piece of Velcro or anything flammable...
was within four inches of any ignition source.
not that it mattered. A ten-inch gap wouldn't have been enough.
the fire wasn't caused by Velcro!
it was caused by the use of 100% pure goddamn oxygen under pressure.
north American was given mission requirements.
one of the requirements was a spacecraft designed to operate filled with oxygen.
and to do so without exploding!
I think it's time you and your friends at NASA took a remedial math course.
in space, the cabin was supposed to contain five pounds per square inch of pure oxygen, right?
fine. So we built it to those specifications.
but you weren't conducting the test in space.
you were conducting it at sea level where the atmospheric pressure is already 14. 8.
that means that in order to simulate the positive pressure of space flight, you had to add some P. S.I.
you guys tanked up that spacecraft with almost 17 pounds per square inch of pure oxygen.
at 17 p. s.i. pure oxygen, Velcro explodes.
the fact remains, we conducted over 15, 000 hours of manned tests...
with pressurized oxygen environments without anything going wrong ever!
well, this time something did go wrong.
you told us there wouldn't be any ignition sources!
and we begged you not to test in high pressure!
all right.
sorry.
normally, Velcro is not much of a fire risk.
this is Velcro in air at sea level.
under intense direct heat...
it'll burn, it'll melt.
it will not support combustion.
this is Velcro in an atmosphere of 100%oxygen.
as for the spark that started it.
from our fire propagation test and analysis of the spacecraft...
we believe the fire started down here.
because of the severity of the fire damage in this part of the spacecraft...
we'll never know for certain how the fire started.
our best guess is that a wire was resting against the inside of this panel door here.
after the door opened and shut a few times...
the Teflon insulation became abraded in two spots.
when the current went through the wire, there was an arc and
you've heard the rest.
you're saying the fire was the result of frayed wiring?
Yes.
disassembly of the Apollo 1 command module was completed at the Kennedy Space Center...
on March 27, 1967, during the first shift.
you keep working these hours, you're gonna have a heart attack.
did you read this thing? - It's 2, 300 pages.
they're nailing us. They're saying it was all our fault.
there's a couple of references to the fact that maybe testing in highly pressurized pure oxygen might be a bit dangerous...
but other than that, we get our butt kicked.
we gotta let 'em know-- - No, we don't.
we're not just gonna take this? - Yes, we are.
we have got files filled with memos begging them not to test like that.
we are going to forget about those files.
we can't blame NASA.
we make NASA look bad, they could cancel the whole program.
Mondale's looking for any excuse to shut it down.
this way, we take a few hits...
but the program rolls on.
with a new contractor. - It's too late to get a new contractor.
kennedy promised the moon by the end of the decade.
they switch contractors now, they can forget about that.
and if it looks like they're gonna miss Kennedy's goal...
public sentiment will evaporate...
and Congress will pull the plug.
they can't replace us.
we put our cap in our hands, beg forgiveness...
and we promise it will never happen again.
we do not fight back.
and we forget those files exist.
what files?
he must be loving this.
who? - Joe Shea.
I can't believe how he's been able to skate through all this unscathed.
that's not what I hear.
from what I hear, Joe has been anything but...
unscathed.
I'm okay. I'm fine.
it's just that we got a lot of people worried about you.
yeah? Well.
I'm just a little overtired.
Hey, I know. Hell, we're all feelin' the pressure.
did you hear about Ron Tucker?
got up in the middle of a review board meeting...
and started drawing an organizational chart of heaven on the blackboard.
at the top goes God, who we'll call "Big Daddy.
Ron's eating soft food in a soft room now...
but at least he's alive.
quality control inspector out at the Cape...
that drove his whole family out in front of a train...
wasn't so lucky.
you, uh
you don't think I'm gonna snap like that, do you?
I don't know.
a lot of people heard you say that you wished you'd been in the spacecraft with the guys.
I'm not sayin' that I wish I was dead.
that's not what I'm saying at all.
it's just
forget it.
what do they want me to do?
who? - The three wise men.
webb, Seamans, Mueller.
they think I've gone over the edge. What would they like me to do?
I don't know.
I'll tell you what I think you should do.
take a break.
just a leave of absence. A couple of weeks and get some rest.
come on, Joe.
you said yourself you were overtired. - I got a lot of work to do.
you see that desk there?
then maybe
I just think maybe you oughta just talk to somebody.
maybe see a psychiatrist.
you really do think I've cracked.
it's just to put everybody's mind at ease.
fine, I'll see a psychiatrist. A couple of psychiatrists.
why don't you bring on a whole platoon of psychiatrists?
but I'm not leaving the program voluntarily till we get to the moon!
I'm gonna come right to the point.
we got letters from the two psychiatrists.
it seems
it seems like you passed with flyin' colors.
one of those psychiatrists complained that seein' you was a waste of time.
I don't want you to think that this reflects on what I think of you.
I honestly feel you're the most valuable man in NASA today.
and that's why I'm gonna say what I'm gonna say.
nasa is about more than just goin' to the moon.
we got the space station to think about and the manned mission to Mars.
I want you to be part of all of that.
it's time you left the detail work behind...
got involved in making policy.
I want you to join me here in Washington.
you won't have to report to anyone except maybe me.
what do you say?
what do I say?
how soon you want me?
how does now sound? - That sounds great.
we got kids in school
you don't have to decide right now.
go back to the hotel, phone your wife, talk about it.
I'll call you tomorrow. All right?
Thanks.
call you tomorrow.
you talk to Joe? - Yeah.
did he bite? - Mm-hmm.
and I feel like a complete and utter heel.
it had to be done. We had to get him outta the way before the hearings.
they'd have torn him to shreds. - I don't know.
maybe these hearings aren't gonna be as horrible as we think.
I'll see you in the mornin'.
going back to your statement, Dr. Mueller...
I think I understood you to say there were nearly 500 inspectors in the Apollo program at the Cape.
Yes.
now, for the life of me...
I cannot understand with all those people...
how a socket wrench could have gone undetected in the capsule from October until January 27.
you're saying it was not because NASA was in a hurry.
the contractor is responsible in some measure.
wasn't that a failure?
did you ever consider cancellation of North American's contract?
wouldn't you say they were negligent?
sir, I have not found anyone at North American or NASA who would not give anything they had to prevent what happened.
but there was negligence on the part of North American...
was there not?
I don't see how you can call what they did negligence...
unless you mean that a company is negligent...if 100% of its work is not done without a mistake.
as someone with extensive experience in testing experimental aircraft...
I can tell you that that standard is just not achievable.
so I don't feel that "negligence" is the proper word.
thank you, Senator.
senator Mondale.
it seems that my colleagues have asked all the questions I was going to ask.
except one.
I have been told, and I would like to have this set straight if I'm wrong...
that there was a report prepared for NASA by General Phillips in mid or late 1965...
which very strongly criticized the Apollo program...
for what were regarded as very serious inadequacies in terms of quality control.
would you comment on that?
was there a Phillips report?
would you comment on that?
I'm not aware of it, sir.
is it then your testimony that no such unusual General Phillips report existed?
is this rumor unfounded?
that's something we gotta take a look at.
let us look it up, sir.
is there somethin' somebody forgot to tell me?
it was a memo. It wasn't a big deal. - It is now!
it came out of the Tiger Team audit from North American.
it's old news. - It's gonna be damaging to us!
I heard a rumor." Rumor, my foot. Probably got a copy in his hand.
the only reason he didn't throw it in front of me like Perry Mason is because he knows the fool thing is classified!
he's gonna kill us.
we're dead before we even got off the damn launchpad.
we still don't know what Anderson's thinking.
he can steer the committee any way he wants.
where were you this morning? He's got us twisting in the wind.
it's understandable. Clinton Anderson has to worry about getting reelected...
just like everybody else.
who's left to testify?
lee Atwood and some of the folks from North American.
they're gonna get torn to pieces right after lunch.
and then there's some members of the review board.
Borman? - Frank's goin' at the end.
that's good. Everybody loves an astronaut.
come on. Are you kidding me?
you really think Frank Borman is gonna paint a rosy picture?
it could have been him in that spacecraft and he knows it.
you're right.
where you goin'?
I'm gonna do the only thing left for me to do.
beg for mercy.
I'm sorry, Mr. Webb, but I've got a job to do.
and I'm going to do it.
with all due humility, Senator...
what did we do wrong?
that's what I'm going to find out.
why are you so down on us?
you and I are both Democrats.
going to the moon was Kennedy's dream.
it was one of his dreams. Jack Kennedy had a lot of dreams.
do you really want to kill Apollo?
I'll tell you what I want, Mr. Webb.
I want there to be no American children going hungry in any of our cities.
I want to do something about our boys dying halfway around the world.
I want to do a lot of things.
and if getting what I want means we don't go to the moon...
then so be it.
Colonel Borman, would you have entered the spacecraft on the morning of the accident if your turn had been called?
Yes, sir.
would you have had any hesitancy?
were there defects in workmanship?
there were.
did these defects go beyond workmanship?
Yes, sir, there were defects in design.
if you had entered the spacecraft on that morning...
would you have been motivated by a desire to take risks?
sometimes there are...
romantic, silk-scarfed notions attributed to this business...
but we're professionals.
we will accept risk, certainly...
but not undue risk.
let me rephrase the question.
knowing what you know now...
would you have entered that spacecraft?
how did Commander Grissom and his crew feel about the readiness of the vehicle?
I talked to Ed White shortly before the accident.
he thought they were over most of their problems and were on their way.
didn't Commander Grissom once hang a lemon on the simulator?
you had to know Gus.
did Commander Grissom hang a lemon on the simulator?
Yes, sir.
tell us about him, Colonel.
sorry. I just have a couple of quick questions.
will you yield for a minute or two?
actually, Mr. Chairman, I-- - Thanks.
you just said "You had to know Gus.
I think that's been missing in here this past two days.
I'd like for the record to contain at least a little bit about the men who perished in that fire.
could you do that for us?
Gus Grissom was the first astronaut to be asked to fly three times.
mercury, Gemini and Apollo.
he loved being an astronaut.
except for the publicity and being on display that comes with the job.
there are no front windows on the house he built for Betty in Timber Cove...
because he didn't want people looking in.
if that gives you the impression that Gus was a cranky S. O.B...
well, he was at times.
but I would have trusted him with my life.
ed White was a big man for an astronaut.
a shade under six feet.
exceptional athlete.
as you all know, Ed was the first American to walk in space.
there was a story going around that when he was on his space walk, he stayed out after being ordered in...
because he was having such a good time.
it's a funny story...
but it would have meant that Ed White disobeyed an order.
not gonna happen.
ed was a West Point man...
and duty, honor, country...
weren't just words to him, they were him.
he was one of my closest friends.
Roger Chaffee I
I didn't know that well. He was one of the new guys.
very energetic, very excited.
I heard a story about him though.
he was out on Long Island visiting the Grumman facility where they're building the descent stage for the lunar module.
he saw a group of men standing in a corner.
he found out these were the fellows that make the tools that make the machines.
none of the bigwigs escorted through there ever talked to these guys.
but Roger made them feel like the most important part of the program.
this isn't a court of law, so I can ask you something that's completely hypothetical.
if we could somehow reach beyond the wall of death and talk to Grissom, White and Chaffee...
what do you imagine they would say about the fire?
I was hoping someone would ask that.
I don't know what Roger or Ed would say...
but I can let Gus speak for himself.
back in January he talked to a group of reporters.
they asked him about the dangers involved in going to the moon.
the conquest of space is worth the risk of life.
our God-given curiosity will force us to go there ourselves...
because, in the final analysis...only man can fully evaluate the moon...
in terms understandable to other men.
at the risk of being gruesome...
we've heard about the fire from everyone who was there.
everyone except the astronauts themselves, of course.
can you tell us what they went through?
what it was like for them?
I can only tell you what we know, or at least what we think we know.
when it happened they were waiting for the test to resume.
how are we gonna get to the moon if we can't talk between three buildings?
I can't hear a thing you're saying. Jesus Christ.
I said, how are we gonna get to the moon...
if we can't talk between two or three buildings?
they wouldn't have seen the spark that started the fire...
because it was behind a panel door...
down below Gus' feet.
because of the oxygen, the spark was able to jump out into the nylon netting under the seats.
Gus probably saw it first because it was closest to him.
fire!
we got a fire in the cockpit!
the procedure would have had Gus push down Ed's headrest...
so that Ed could start turning the latch handle.
we got a bad fire!
we're burning up!
by now the temperature and the pressure were astronomical.
let's get out!
now.
it just took me a minute or more to tell you all that.
in actuality, from the first mention of the fire to the rupture of the hull, only 15 seconds went by.
what caused the fire?
I'm not talking about wires and oxygen.
it seems that some people think that NASA pressured North American to meet unrealistic and arbitrary deadlines...
and that, in turn, North American allowed safety to be compromised.
I won't deny that there's been pressure to meet deadlines...
but safety has never been intentionally compromised.
then what caused the fire?
a failure of imagination.
we've always known there was the possibility of fire in a spacecraft.
but the fear was that it would happen in space when you're 180 miles from terra firma and the nearest fire station.
that was the worry.
no one ever imagined that it would happen on the ground.
if anyone had, the test would have been classified as hazardous.
but it wasn't. We just didn't think of it.
whose fault is that?
it's North American's fault.
it's NASA's fault.
it's the fault of every person who ever worked on Apollo.
it's my fault.
I didn't think the test was hazardous.
no one did.
I wish to God we had.
now before we all go home...
is there any statement you personally would like to make?
I think I'm safe in speaking for all the astronauts when I say that...
we're confident in our management...
we're confident in our training...
in our engineering and in ourselves.
the real question is, are you confident in us?
what do you think we should do?
I think you should stop this witch hunt...
and let us go to the moon.
please.
back to you.
thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have nothing further.
thank you, Colonel.
those are beautiful.
well, thank you, dear.
who called?
he wants to see me. - On a Sunday?
I think this is it.
I wanted to see it through to the landing.
Oh, damn it.
yeah? - There's a Mr. Storms to see you.
they said I wouldn't have to report to anyone.
trouble is there's no one to report to me either.
what do you do? - I go to the movies, museums.
there's a lot of damn fine museums in this town.
did you know that? - Yeah, I think I've heard that.
what's next? - I'm gettin' out.
join a company in Boston. How about you?
they moved me over to the brake yard. I'm still a V. P. but
I still talk with my old buddies at the space division now and then.
they say that things have really improved since the fire.
everybody's working together better than ever.
there's a whole new sense of purpose, sense of relief.
relief?
everyone knew an accident was inevitable.
I know.
I talked to some UPI reporters a couple of weeks before the fire.
I said to them I believed some kind of accident was probably inevitable.
I also said I thought it would be harder on those of us on the ground.
the astronauts are dead, God rest them...
but we have to live with the knowledge we could have done something different.
there's nothing you could have done.
I could have been in the cockpit that day.
why is it every time I say that people assume I mean I wish I were dead?
the fire started on the left side...
below Gus' feet, right?
if I'd been on the spacecraft that day...
I would have been lying below the footrest right there where it started.
I figure I had a 50-50 chance of putting it out before it got out of control.
my years in flight test, I saw a number of crews slam into the desert floor.
too many.
I love those guys, and each time that happened I wanted to die.
but I've learned that you gotta let go of the what ifs.
they're meaningless.
and they'll kill you.
Yeah.
really meant a lot your coming by.
I know we didn't always see eye to eye.
I got mine up in the den.
yeah?
I'm thinking about the front hall.
you had to know it was Gus' idea.
take care.
good luck. - You too.
then that leaves only one very important thing...
which is, of course, who's paying for dinner.
north American, I guess.
that didn't take long. - Wait, gentlemen.
before we go, Roger, Ed and I have a little presentation we'd like to make to Joe and Stormy here.
Oh, yeah?
it's just a little something from us.
from us to you. A little something from the guys.
plain brown paper. I'm a little nervous.
why am I frightened for my life?
because you know us. - It's not ticking, is it?
probably designs for the power steering.
that's great.
that's very funny, you guys. Thank you.
we have absolute faith in you. - Yeah, right.
thank you. That's very nice.
it isn't that we don't trust you, Joe, but this time...
we've decided to go over your head.
I got a call from some woman at NASA, Deke.
they don't wanna call it Apollo 1 anymore because it never flew.
they're gonna call it Apollo 20
204. That was the internal designation.
it's like they already want people to forget it happened.
this is the reason we wanted to see you.
open it.
it's an astronaut pin.
the guys knew you would never get into space because of your heart problem...
but they wanted you to know they considered you as much of an astronaut as any of them.
they were gonna give that to you when they got back.
we choose to go to the moon.
we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things.
not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
look at that. - That's beautiful.
this is one of the most thrilling moments of my life I guarantee you.
the great adventure of going to the moon may never happen again in our life.
manned space flight will continue...
and there is adventure to be found in high Earth orbit.
robots have already gone to other worlds:
the valleys of Mars, the clouds and moons of Jupiter.
there is a brand of adventure to be had in such a long-distance mode of human participation.
but the satisfaction and the sudden emptiness of an adventure completed are intangible human concepts.
the argument can be made that mankind cannot bear witness to an event...
unless one of mankind has experienced the adventure firsthand.
not necessarily first, mind you, just firsthand.
it is certainly not necessary to be Neil Armstrong to have experienced the great adventure found in a voyage from the Earth to the moon.
Hey, Beano, turn around and give me a big smile!
my name is Al Bean.
that's me, standing in the Ocean of Storms on November 21, 1969.
there I am again, five very heady days later...
aboard our recovery ship where they set up a quarantine trailer...
for me and my two crewmates: Pete Conrad, my skipper...
and Dick Gordon, our command module pilot.
they were Gemini veterans who are about as cool as they come.
everyone knew they'd be going to the moon, unlike me.
this was my first space flight.
I would be forever known as the fourth man to set foot on the lunar surface.
Pete and Dick wanted to be on the first landing...
but I'd have been happy to be on the 93rd.
funny, Beano. You're a dead man!
crying out loud, I had the President of the United States calling me.
good morning, Mr. President.
me, Al Bean. Last guy in his astronaut group to even fly.
we take our jobs very seriously. - The commander in chief promoted all three of us to Navy captains.
thank you very much, sir. Yes, sir.
congratulations, Captain Bean. Captain Gordon.
captain Conrad. Captain Bean. - Captain Conrad. Captain Gordon.
people were treating me with great care...
making sure we hadn't come home with any alien diseases.
careful not to puncture his brain, Doc.
that is very funny, Dick. You're a very funny pilot.
we hadn't, but one of the cameras conked me pretty good during splashdown.
it was my own damn fault.
I was supposed to remove it and put it under my seat...
like it said on the checklist.
I guess I was so happy the parachutes had worked that I said...
I'll just leave it there on its window mount.
that is stupid.
if it had hit me in the center of the forehead...
it would have probably killed me...
which would have been a really sad situation.
hit the breakers. - I'm doing it.
what? - Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so. I'm fine.
did you get knocked out? - What?
actually, I had, but I didn't realize it until later.
hell, the whole trip I didn't have too much luck with cameras.
I'll explain that later.
bump or not, I was alive and well. So were my friends.
we made it, and we made it well.
let me disinfect that for you. - Ow!
maybe we weren't dignified enough to be heroes. lt wouldn't matter.
cause we were the second mission to land on the moon.
history's ultimate anticlimax.
somehow, I fit right in.
flying with Pete and Dick was the sweetest thing about the mission for me.
we were a true team.
at one point, I even kind of saved the day.
I didn't know what to expect. I was a complete rookie.
we'd done countless simulated launches...
so I did the same things I did during all of those.
Roger, STC. Main bus tie bat B/C switch, on, up.
I kept busy checking the console...
making sure our command module, Yankee Clipper, was ready to go.
looks like this launch is gonna be a wet one.
no big deal for an all-Navy crew. We can handle it.
the rain was considered a bother, but nothing to worry about.
Apollo 12, you are go for launch.
Roger. Go for launch.
me and my best buddies were ready for the adventure of a lifetime.
al Bean, you are going to the moon.
y'all can come along if you like.
we have ignition sequence start.
the engines are on. Four, three...
the first few moments after liftoff, you're vibrating pretty good.
the clock is running. - Then you really start to move.
clear the tower. - Roger. Clear the tower.
I got a pitch-and-roll program, and this baby is really going.
roll complete.
mark one bravo. - Got you on that.
this thing moves, doesn't it?
baby!
we had just over half a minute of trouble-free launch...
and then all hell busted loose.
what the hell was that? - I just lost a whole bunch of stuff.
we just had a whole bunch of buses drop out.
what have we got here? A/C bus 1 light, all the fuel cells.
okay, Houston, we just lost the platform, gang.
I got three fuel cell lights, an A/C bus light, a fuel cell disconnect...
A/C bus overload 1 and 2, main bus A and B out.
we had some big glitch here.
I got A/C. - You got A/C? Maybe it's the indicator.
what's on the main bus? - 24 volts. That's low.
we've got a short of some kind, but I can't believe that's accurate.
flight, EECOM. - Go, EECOM.
I think it's a fuel cell bus failure. They've been thrown off-line somehow.
that must be why we're getting garbage here.
can they try SCE to aux?
Gerry Griffin had never heard that command before.
most of the people in Mission Control hadn't.
tell them.
Apollo 12, Houston.
try SCE to auxiliary. Over.
FCE to auxiliary? What the hell is that?
I'm not sure even Pete knew what that was, but one person did.
I know what that is.
SCE to aux.
we're getting good telemetry again. Try to reset your fuel cells.
reset fuel cells. - Wait for staging.
hang on.
okay, Houston. GDC is good.
we got a good S-2, gang.
we copy that, Pete. You're looking good.
poor Gerry Griffin.
we were his first mission as flight director...
and he had dealt with more malfunctions than anybody had ever seen.
now we'll straighten out our problems here.
I don't know what happened. I'm not sure we didn't get hit by lightning.
that's exactly what had happened.
before our first stage had finished doing its job...
observers back on the ground later reported that not just one but two bolts of lightning rode our exhaust contrail...
all the way back down to the pad and hit the tower.
that was a hell of a simulation.
Al's got all the buses back on-line.
we'll square up our platform when we get into orbit.
so I had done my part to help out in a crisis.
of course, we owe a lot to that EECOM fella, John Aaron.
but to me, the real hero was Pete Conrad.
he kept his hand on the abort handle the entire time.
but he kept his cool and he never used it.
once I got into Earth's orbit...
I found space flight was everything it was supposed to be.
take a look at this.
those are campfires down there.
that's something, isn't it? - Yes.
beautiful.
down there, people were gathered around man's most primitive discovery.
here the three of us were riding 250, 000 miles into space on a flame.
man, that sky is black.
Yes, it is.
how we looking, Dickie?
you all finished realigning the platform?
I is finished. - Outstanding.
that will give them something to write about tonight.
I bet all our wives fainted.
I'll bet they did when they heard you call about 18 lights.
every time I close my eyes, all I see are those damn lights.
what a way to start. - Terrible way to break in Al Bean.
that's okay. I don't mind.
not everybody was thinking about how Al Bean was enjoying the mission.
in Houston, unbeknownst to us, there was serious concern that the lightning had damaged our pyrotechnic system that would deploy our parachutes.
if we run the TEI checklist...
we test everything they need to get home...
except one big item: deployment of the chutes.
Yeah, but if the barometric switches and timers have failed...
the crew can deploy the chutes manually.
but if the pyros had already been fired
once they're gone, pushing the deploy button won't do anything at all.
is there any way to check the pyros? - Only visual inspection, from outside.
all right, I'll let you know.
they finally decided that if it had...
we'd be just as dead splashing down now as ten days from now.
so they might as well send us to the moon.
sugar
Ah, honey, honey
you are my candy, girl
and you got me wanting you
come on now! Honey - Honey? - Yeah.
Oh, sugar, sugar
damn it! I wish I could shit.
I don't have the slightest inclination, but I know what will happen.
it's gonna be the first shit on the lunar surface.
okay, Al, your turn. - Excuse me?
I don't want to take any time out on the moon.
go down there and try to make a poop.
why are you laughing? You're next.
I didn't know that as commander you had that kind of authority.
he thinks he can control our bowel movements.
on family trips, didn't your mother make you go before you left?
this is the longest damn vacation you boys have ever been on...
and in this vehicle I am your mother.
I want you to work at it. I'm serious.
I'll see what I can do.
fortunately, at this point, we had time to debate such issues.
I'm sure you're dying to know how it all turned out.
once again, this is Emmett Seaborn.
those of you who have been with us all night are going to see quite a treat.
no, they didn't broadcast my bowel movement around the world.
in fact, they didn't broadcast much at all.
here's where my bad luck with the TV cameras comes in.
the color camera aboard Apollo 12 is a substantial improvement...
over the black-and-white unit Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had...
Oh, boy. Look at that.
I was in charge of setting up the TV camera on the tripod...
so that those people who stayed up all night to see a rerun could watch us on the moon.
this would have worked out great had I not accidentally done something that I wasn't supposed to do.
in all our months of training, we never had the actual camera.
all we had was a block of wood.
this procedure needs to be completed in four minutes.
I knew where I was supposed to put it and where the sun would be.
someone probably told me to keep the lens shaded or something.
don't point it at the sun. Set the focus at infinity.
but there were so many things to digest in training to walk on the moon...
I guess I just forgot it.
we have a pretty bright image on the TV.
can you move it or stop it down?
I'll stop it down.
that's as far as it goes, Houston. How does it look to you?
still looks the same. Why don't you try shifting the scene.
how's that? - Looks the same.
we have a bright image at the top...
and then blacked out about eighty percent at the bottom.
that's coming in better. What change did you make?
I hit on the top with my hammer. We didn't have a thing to lose.
skillful fix. - Yeah. I hit it with this hammer.
that's skilled craftsmanship. Let me try it again.
we're still not getting a good picture, and you're running a tad behind.
press on and we'll try to get back to it later if we have time.
Houston, let me move it around so the back is to the sun.
maybe that will help.
when all was said and done, nothing happened.
it's hard to get a TV repairman to make a house call in Anytown, USA...and impossible, of course, on the moon.
the vidicon tube was fried beyond repair...
so that was the end of color TV from the Ocean of Storms.
they probably knew on the ground exactly what I had done wrong...
but nobody wanted to say anything.
from Houston, this is Emmett Seaborn.
I just hope I didn't disappoint anyone.
what the fuck happened up there?
forget it. Let's go.
what happened was I had screwed up.
not even Dick, who was stuck in orbit while we explored the surface.
but flying solo in Yankee Clipper was considered more important than being the commander's sidekick on the moon.
got it. Lock inner mast. Lock outer mast.
extend locked legs. We've done that.
I clearly remember the last moments we spent before we separated.
we could have never gotten down there or home again if it weren't for that man.
in all the time we trained together...
Dick Gordon never once showed resentment when people would introduce me as "the guy who was going to the moon with Pete Conrad.
never a trace of sarcasm. Never an ironic remark.
he was in line for a command of his own.
he was holding out to walk on the moon on Apollo 18.
unfortunately, there never was an Apollo 18...
so this was as close as he ever got.
I guess we gotta close her up now.
I wish this son of a bitch fit three people.
at that moment, with all the challenges ahead of us...
all I could think was one thought:
sure hope I see you again.
nervous?
how did we get out here anyway?
I just hope I can find a place to land.
and I hope I can set it down all right.
you'll do fine.
you'll do just fine.
just don't bring her in too low, too fast.
thanks a lot.
I'm just trying to help. - Thanks very much.
you know I'm here for you. - I know you are. Big help.
unlike Neil and Buzz...
our mission called for us not just to land wherever the ground looked good.
on 11, they were lucky to land almost three miles from where they had planned.
but we had a target...
which had been waiting for us in the Ocean of Storms for two years:
an unmanned probe named Surveyor 3.
if future missions were gonna explore the moon in depth...
Apollo 12 would have to demonstrate a precise touchdown was possible.
forty-two feet. Coming down at three. Start the clock.
forty. Coming down at two.
looking good. Thirty-two.
thirty feet. Down at two.
plenty of gas, babe. Hang in there. Eighteen feet.
coming down at two. He's got it made.
come on in there. Twenty-four feet.
contact light.
shit.
pro! - Yeah!
okay, engine arm off.
you got your commander light off? - Yep.
I'll cycle the main shutoff valve. - Okay.
good landing. Outstanding.
that was incredible.
Yeah!
Houston, we're in real good shape.
you guys did outstanding targeting.
that thing was right down the middle. Beautiful!
way to go.
look out there. Isn't it beautiful? - Man, that's beautiful.
that is something else. That is amazing.
unbelievable. - Oh, my God.
you want to ask them? - Yeah. All right.
Houston, lntrepid.
go, Intrepid.
where are we?
by all the numbers and delta vectors and crater sightings...
it looked like we were right where we wanted to be.
but it wasn't until Dick made a flyover pass...
that we found out how good a job Pete had done bringing us down.
Houston, I have Snowman.
I believe I have the LEM on the northwest corner of
I have Intrepid.
he's the only thing that casts a shadow down there.
he's on the Surveyor crater about a third of the way on the Surveyor crater to the head of the snowman.
and I have Surveyor.
Roger, Clipper. Good eyeball. Well done.
ed, it's almost as good as being there.
almost.
Pete had done it.
with the help of the targeting people on the ground...
he had proven that pinpoint accuracy was possible when landing on the moon.
he had set down our lunar module a stone's throw away from our primary mission objective
a short moon walk of about 200 yards
just like he said he would.
not long after that...
sometime very early in the morning back in Houston...
Pete Conrad proved something else.
he proved to me and the world just how eloquent a man he can be.
Charles "Pete" Conrad, Jr.
only the third human being to set foot on the moon.
who can forget Neil Armstrong's immortal words.
let's watch and listen to the words Conrad has chosen to mark this moment in history.
that may have been a small one for Neil, but it's a long one for me.
there you have it.
after training with him for months, we'd all become accustomed to Pete's colorful use of language.
you stupid
this thing's about to piss me off.
I finally get the cocksucker turning, then it locks up again.
I'm spending more time trying to turn these frigging bolts than any goddamn else thing.
Goddamn. Son of a-- Cocksucker. Goddamn it.
turn around and give me a big smile.
I had a special moment for myself to mark my getting to the moon.
when you are selected to become a member of the astronaut corps...
you wear a special silver pin.
it gets replaced by a gold pin when you actually fly a mission.
I had worn my silver pin for six years.
being selected for Apollo 12, I wouldn't be needing it anymore.
I wanted to put it in a special place where it would rest forever.
what better place than in the Ocean of Storms.
I joined NASA in the third group of 14 astronauts in 1963.
so did Dick Gordon who flew with Pete in Gemini 11.
while he and the rest of the group were jockeying for seats on lunar landing flights...
I was assigned to the Apollo Applications Program...
the space station which came to be known as Skylab.
Pete called it "Tomorrowland.
planning things so far in the future...
who knew if they'd ever become a reality or not.
while I was tucked away in some far-off corner...
it seemed everyone else was assigned mission after mission.
I sort of felt like the forgotten man.
but I kept an eye on what my peers were doing.... all the guys I used to commiserate with about not getting to fly.
Walt Cunningham made the crew of Apollo 7.
bill Anders, Apollo 8.
rusty Schweickart, Apollo 9.
that left just me.
but there were others from our group that were not so fortunate.
Ted Freeman was flying his T-38 at a couple hundred miles per hour...
when a goose smashed in the Plexiglas of his cockpit.
he was killed.
Charlie Basset died along with Elliot See...
when Elliot crashed into a building at the McDonnell plant in St. Louis.
Roger Chaffee was on the crew of Apollo 1...
killed in the fire with Gus Grissom and Ed White.
then there was C. C. Williams.
he was supposed to be the original lunar module pilot on Apollo 12 along with Pete and Dick.
he had spent the night before our astronaut physicals jumping up and down to compress his spine.
there was a six-foot height limit, and C. C. was a shade over six feet even.
he was a superb astronaut who impressed everyone he met...
but C. C. was killed when his T-38 went into a spin over the swamps of Tallahassee.
he had been cruising at 24, 000 feet when his controls locked...
and the plane went into a steep dive.
he didn't have time to bail out.
at that point, I wasn't even hoping to fly Apollo anymore.
it just hurt too much to think about it.
but I guess somebody was looking out for me.
somebody named Pete Conrad.
al, you got a minute?
Hi, Pete. Sure. What can I do for you?
I just talked to Deke.
how'd you like to go to the moon with Dick and me?
do you think you can give up all this excitement?
you okay?
you're on board.
Mm-hmm.
it was such a shock...
it took some time to really sink in.
once on the moon, I had little time to think about such things.
I heard once the real cost of us being there...
was about a million dollars for each minute.
Pete and I did our best to stretch every penny of America's money.
we're not just astronauts.
suddenly, we're meteorologists, seismologists...
geologists, geochemists, you name it.
Pete and Al, Houston.
looks like you did your job. We're getting data back.
we're picking up your heavy footsteps going by the seismometer.
it's great. - Our bosses couldn't see us...
but now they knew how fast we were working.
man, are you dirty. This is dirt dirt.
remember how they took care of these experiments?
in training you needed gloves to touch them.
tell them it's important to keep the experiments free of dust.
Dr. Wilson asks you guys not to forget to keep the connectors and experiments free of dust.
Roger.
dirt or no dirt, everything worked fine.
while we were laughing and chatting away...
poor Dick was trying to get work done.
okay, Clipper. You did not copy all of that PAD. ls that affirm?
ed, if you want to talk to me, you'll have to take it off relay...
so Pete and Al won't cut you out.
it's impossible to hear anything with those guys yakking.
there were so many things for us to remember to do on the moon...
that we needed some kind of cheat sheet that would always be within reach.
both of us had drafted a checklist to wear on our sleeves...
but the actual flight item was made up by the ground crew just before launch...
and put in our suits without our even seeing them...
until we were on the moon.
thanks to Dave Scott and the rest of our backup crew...
we had a little extra reading to do.
look at your checklist.
that's the terrain for me!
with a 30-minute extension to our EVA...
I was able to get the core sample tube in and out of the ground.
Pete and I got up our first load of moon rocks.
we dusted each other off, then I started back up the ladder.
just like that, the first of my two four-hour moon walks was over.
it's impossible to truly appreciate something when it's happening.
I suppose I had flashes of thought like: "How did I get to the moon?
but if you put yourself in my place...
your head would be filled with so many checklists and procedures...
that all you could do, really, was look at the panel readouts...
upon which your life depends...
feeling bad about that lost TV camera.
it wasn't the reason we came to the moon.
I know we're all human and we mess up...
but I sure felt bad about it.
Pete and Dick are more typical of the astronaut personality:
unflappable, confident, fun loving.
as for me, one out of three ain't bad.
we did have fun together.
we were the most close-knit of any crew that ever flew.
Pete even got us matching gold Corvettes...
customized for our positions on the crew:
cdr for commander...
and LMP for me, the lunar module pilot.
those men were then and still are my best friends.
if you're gonna do all this work to get to the moon, it should be fun.
I probably should have taken a sleeping pill, but that wasn't manly.
finally, I was able to put work aside...
allow myself a moment of peace, a moment of calm.
finally, I got to sleep.
that doesn't sound right.
it's okay.
no warning lights.
the cabin pressure is okay. - It's the cooling pump.
helium regulator's nominal. It's not the burst disk.
it's the cooling pump. lt's okay. - Yeah?
cooling pump? - Yeah.
I guess you're right.
I am.
back to sleep.
since you're up-- - Yeah? What?
I've been awake for a while. - You have?
why didn't you say anything? -This neck ring is cutting into my neck.
the cocksucker is killing me.
they snugged up my boot too tight, and it's pulling on the one side.
we have to re-lace it.
now that we were up, I started thinking about the EVA to come:
our second and last.
we were planning to take a very historic photo using a special timer we had snuck on board.
hurry up. - Let's go.
come on. Sit down. - You got it set up?
all the photographs from Apollo 11 were of Buzz taken by Neil...
one astronaut with maybe the other guy reflected in his visor.
we had the idea to use this timer and get both me and Pete in the picture...
it was a great idea. - Electric man.
the trick was finding the right moment so Houston wouldn't catch on.
by the time we made it to the Surveyor...
we had less than an hour left outside in the Ocean of Storms.
our first order of business was that secret photo.
I had practiced finding the timer plenty of times and never had trouble.
I had the whole procedure down to a few seconds.
the result would have been magnificent.
had I been able to find the damn thing.
I'll be darned.
isn't it in there? - Let me look one more time.
wait. What's in your bag here?
it's just a film magazine. - I'll try at this end.
I knew I was wasting precious time.
if it didn't turn up quick, it would be criminal to continue the search.
so-- - I've had it.
forget it. - All right.
let's mosey down there and grab what we came here for.
in 1967, Surveyor's TV camera had broadcast the first-ever television pictures from the surface of the moon.
we aimed to take that camera home...
so they could study the long-term effects of the moon on manmade machines.
getting it would mean we had completed all of our mission objectives.
we got her.
I got it.
got something for you.
after more than three hours of hard work on the moon...
I probably wasn't the most imaginative person.
had I been thinking fully...
that's when we would have taken the picture with that timer.
we could have shook hands standing in front of lntrepid.
it would have been a great picture, but I didn't think of it.
there was just one last thing to do.
none of us had forgotten the reason I was privileged enough to be there.
we made it, C. C.
we left C. C.'s wings on the lunar surface.
he's the reason there's four stars on our mission patch, not just three.
then that was it.
our walk on the moon was officially over.
I had spent seven hours and 45 minutes walking on the moon.
in a person's lifetime, that's nothing but a blink.
but what my eyes witnessed there at the Ocean of Storms still fuels me...
still fills me with a sense of wonder that is hard to put into words.
what a neat ride!
al said it was okay. So was the flag.
Neil and Buzz's ascent had knocked the crap out of their flag.
they could send a man to the moon, but they couldn't think to place the flag 50 feet away from a rocket engine...so it wouldn't get blown over.
check our range and range rate. - Okay.
intrepid, Houston.
you are ten seconds to LOS.
we'll pick you up again at 142: 21: 31 through honeysuckle.
Roger, Houston. We'll see you on the other side.
what do you say?
want to take a minute and fly this vehicle?
even though I was called the lunar module pilot...
the only way I'm supposed to fly the LEM is in an emergency.
you got it. - I got it.
some people might want the commander to fly all the time.
some commanders might do just that.
how's it feel? - It feels real good.
Oh, man. lt's better than the sim. - A lot better.
Yeah. lt really feels great.
it's unbelievable. Man.
I don't know if anyone in Houston would have criticized Pete...
but we were on the far side of the moon.
and they had no way of knowing.
so, for a few moments on Apollo 12...
the lunar module pilot actually piloted the lunar module...
thanks to my good friend, Pete Conrad.
howdy, fellows!
Jesus! Did you have to bring back half the moon with you?
you ain't messing up my nice, clean spacecraft.
strip down and wipe yourselves off before you come in here.
I mean it. Go.
he's right. You're filthy.
welcome home, fellows.
can I get you anything to drink? Water? Any beverage at all?
careful not to flip any breakers with anything hanging out.
attitude: dead minimum.
when we were out of our suits...
we had to strap in and jettison the lunar module.
spacecraft control SCS. - All right.
we're all set to jettison the LEM in about a minute.
you know, if we were to lose the hatch...
when we blow the LEM...
and one day someone was to find us floating around up here like this...
they might be pretty confused.
at least we'll go out of this world the same way we came in.
you two.
you didn't come into the world in that suit?
man, I hope not.
after a day of lunar orbit photography...
getting stereo photos of possible landing sights for Apollo 13 and 14...
and when every piece of equipment was stowed...
and checked off the flight plan...
we prepared for the big burn that would take us home.
hrb forward, check.
all right. We're just waiting for the DSKY.
I feel sort of like that song:
is That All There ls?
I was just thinking the exact same thing.
not that it wasn't amazing.
just that the whole experience didn't feel like a headline.
it was real, and I had lived it.
falling through the sky after a trip to the moon is no more surreal an experience than getting there in the first place or walking on its surface.
it's just one more step, one more planned event...
that comes about because of science and imagination and effort.
you can go through all the manuals...all the procedures and checklists...all the graphs and blueprints that show how it's possible to do what we did...
you might be impressed that such a complicated thing was even attempted.
so impressed even that you wouldn't realize that the three people who made the journey and undertook all the challenges contained within it...
were, in essence...not that much different from yourself.
damn, that shower feels good. - When it doesn't feel that good...you'll know you're officially home from the moon.
they should let us out of here. I don't have any diseases.
me neither. I just want to grab me some cajun food and a couple of beers.
how about you, Al? You back from the moon yet?
Yeah, I'm back.
I'm back from the moon.
what are you laughing at? - Yeah. What's so funny?
I don't think I'll ever forget...
when all that good stuff was lighting up...
and then CAPCOM called up SCE to auxiliary.
I didn't know what the hell that meant...
all I hear is Al Bean's voice, two octaves higher than normal...
saying, "I know what it is.
the best record of what it was like to have gone to the moon and return...
is not in the tangible evidence of the endeavor.
it's not in the things we took or brought back.
it wouldn't have been in the TV footage we never got...
which I beat myself up over for half the mission.
it's in the individual consciousness and vision of the human beings who made the trip.
people like Dick Gordon, Pete Conrad and even me.
my, that sun is bright.
it feels good.
let's go. - Yeah.
in the end, what I have left are memories.
almost like it was a trip to the seashore...
or a drive in the country.
they mix together in a constant stream of thoughts and images that come and go...like all memories do.
the most precious things I brought back with me were the same things I left with: my two best friends.
I realize when you go through any endeavor, any journey...
whether across town or to the moon and back...
all that matters is sharing the experience with people that you love.
that's what makes life special.
because, ultimately, that's all there is.
that's really all there is.
there's a place up ahead and I'm going
come away Come away if you're going
leave the sinking ship behind
here is so beautiful.
yes
I was born near here, by the lake Jefferson.
I come here since I was a little boy.
your parents still live around here?
no they're gone, My grandparents raised me.
my papa here spent this live build the levels right here, for free of course.
he was a slave?
my grandma always tell me be good. Ask the Confederates rise about Marshall submitaring, kidding me.
what?
I just never had seen this side of you before.
what side?
you seem so calm, so peaceful.
this does to me
I am happy when I up here, you know.
it's funny.
the part of me wants just stay out here by the lake, you know.
read books all day, and hunt fish when I get hungry.
and the other part want to go everywhere and see everything.
I want to go to New Orleans, and New York, and Chicago,...and San Francisco.
so wanna go...
walking down the road...
and disappear.
maybe you can take me with you.
get over. - What?
Schoolband played the outside.
what? Oh my Jesus! I thought you said that nobody ever comes today.
nobody ever does come here, Samantha. Hold on, hold on.
Henry, come on!
Henry!
get dress. - What's going on?
we gonna go get Mr. Tolson and Samantha
had back to the campus and have pepper out.
come on get dress.
you know, you go get Tolson and I'm meet you up later on campus.
come on Lowe you knows it's gonna be fun...
I guess it tell me you gonna join us later.
he's gonna join us later.
just has to clean his house that's all.
great news, great news, great news!
my phone has been ringing off the hook.
university of Michigan wants to debate us.
so that's SMU, so that's Georgia. Where is Mr. Lowe?
when do I get to debate?
sooner than you think James, sooner than you think.
when?
when you're ready. - I am ready now.
Mr. Tolson, I do not mind if James...
what's wrong?
maybe I'm tired of this. - Of what?
of watching another people debate.
when am I get a chance to prove myself?
you are best researcher James. We can not do this without you.
you do plenty without me.
excuse me.
James. - What?
James, you wait.
it was so mean what you said in there.
I don't wanna lose your friendship...
how can you lose something that you never had?
you've never my friend?
may be I don't wonna be your friend.
maybe it hurts me to be your friend.
get hands. Mr. Tolson!
where is he?
calm down Henry. - Have you seen him?
no they won't let us.
they ain't do to you? - No, we're fine.
sheriff. I am dr James Farmer, Wiley College.
this is William Taylor, Mr. Tolson attorney.
and this is his wife, Ruth. - Hello.
I'd like to see my client, please.
William.
sir Dozier, dr James Farmer, this is... - Hello William. How you doing today?
fine, sir. And you? - Not too bad, not too bad.
me and William we go way back,
I knew William when I was a boy.
could I see my client now, sheriff?
your client? The fact the debusis is
william that your client is kind busy right now.
busy doing what?
sheriff, sheriff.
the situation...
get some boys out there.
right man.
let him go, let him go...
let him go! Let him go! Let him go! Let him go!
let him go! Let him go! Let him go!
let him go! Let him go! Let him go! Let him go!
let him go! Let him go! Let him go! Let him go!
they're with you? - That's right.
see, this is what happens to a town when you let the unions in.
starts trouble.
people get all wild up about nothing.
one's allow to get hurt if you catch my drift.
sheriff, it is clear that you have not evidence, To arrest Mr. Tolson.
I suggest you let him go.
you suggest it? Who the hell are you?
couple months ago, There was rage on floor Tulinch bar.
it was a peaceful and loveful gathered in sharecroppers,
who was brutally attacked by a gang of violent villagers.
now witnesses see, that you were there.
if you lead that rage Sheriff,
you're the one who broke the law. Not Tolson.
are you threatening me, boy? - No, sir.
I wouldn't do that.
but I can not speak for those people outside.
an unjust law is no law at all.
what it does mean?
a mass slaughter citizens.
both white and colored...by Texas Rangers.
it's that really what you want as a Sheriff of this county?
now you let Tolson go home.
I believe, I belive these fox outside...
...they go home as well.
that paid was worth 25 dollars. - What?
you owe my father's the money.
have a seat Mr. Farmer.
Oh Lord...
smu canceled.
university of Georgia sounds like they will follow soon.
Why?
I've been blacklisted.
they're talking about censoring me, Dean clainthe board have asked me to...
stop working with sharecroppers or else,
they say that is not my fight.
So...Things are bad.
my academic career is endanger,
my debate team has nowhere to go.
anyone knows who Antaios was?
sure, he was a giant from Graceland Greek mythology.
his mother was Gaia, the Goddess of Earth, and...
I mean he was unbeatable, because any time he was throw down to the Earth that would make him stronger.
that's correct it would make him stronger. Defeat with make him stronger.
you are my students, I am your teacher.
I think that is secret trust.
so what do I say to you now?
quit? Because the Dean says so, because the Sheriff says so?
because the Texas Rangers says so, no!
I am diametric oppose to that.
my message you is to never quit.
we are not quiting.
good. - What do you wanna us to do?
debate Harvard.
Harvard? - Harvard University, the best national champions.
if we defeat them, we defeat the best.
Mr. Tolson, sir with the whole respect.
harvard ain't go to debate us. Not little Wiley College in Marshall, Texas. They know who we are, Henry.
I've writting them letters, sending them monitors...
but how do we get a little bat? - By continuing to win.
Dr. Farmer has informed me, that Harvard University, is gonna be in Preview next week.
we are not eliminated risk. If we eliminate Harvard...
...we will beat two best negro college in the Amierica.
I can guarantee you that I will see to the Harvard does not ignore that.
all right?
Yes.
look for that, you see on this?
I've been looking all the time. - Preview, Texas.
1-27 - 1-27. - You show me whatever course. It's not on.
1-27, near the wax a hutch.
not there. - Is there, you just can't find it.
I see 2 and I see 7.
right, now look for 1 in front of this and you get it.
after 1-26,
before 1-28.
I really don't think... Where you get this map?
what are you doing?
I'll come down.
back in the car, shut the door.
nobody move.
get down, get down.
get down too.
there is a negro in that car. - Come on, let's pick it.
all right, everybody sit tighten...
...I get the keys.
how you doing Mrs. Baker? - I am fine. You all right?
Yes, Mrs. Baker. - Come inside, please. - Thank you.
Henry.
Henry!
Henry!
hi baby, how you doing? Still waiting for me?
what's the matter baby? Come on.
baby!
Samantha!
shut up, let's go.
where? - Shut up, let's go.
where we going?
got him Mr. Tolson.
OK, sit...
come here. Give me a hug.
stop. ...what I see, great big nigga hung on the tree...
it's worthless...
what?
you think you are only one hurt?
OK, I'm sorry...
for everything...
for drinking...
I apologise.
I'm not talking about me.
you're right.
I'm go talk to her.
no, no, you won't allow she doesn't need to see you like this.
no, is ok, I'm just go talk to her...
can you leave me alone. - No.
calm down boy,
stop, stop.
I am not playing with you.
calm down.
you're crazy?
you've never forgot what you saw up there, you understand it. You've never forgot what you saw up there.
he hung his easy tore sometimes sometimes they cut your fingers off,
your toes, your nose, your ears.
sometimes they cut your genitalia off.
sometimes skinned you alive.
you've never been forget.
what do you think he did? - You did not have to do nothing, James.
you did not have to do nothing. In Texas, they lynch negroes.
do you understand?
so it doesn't matter how do we are, doesn't?
what do you talk... what?
this is all useless.
what do you talking about?
we're just a bunch negroes debate each other on subjects we all agree on.
James, don't talk like that. All right?
why not? - Because you can't.
not you.
Bye, God bless.
where is Samantha?
she's not going with us.
why not?
what do you think?
I took her to the bus station. She wanna go back to school.
you wanted your chance?
this is it.
how can any negro...defend the punishment of prison...
when he sees so much oppression in his own life?
how?
because crime itself is a form of oppression.
and negroes form victim to more violent crime, than any other race in America.
for us. Prison not only offers protection, but retribution.
Yes, it is. - And for the criminal...
it is a dark gift...
the hard shame that introduces a man to himself...
that rises his passion for freedom...
his hope for redemption.
our next debate from Wiley College, Mr. James Farmer Junior.
Mr. Farmer.
mum.
mum.
honey! - Hi!
Hi!
so...
we lost.
I'm sorry.
this came...
Harvard.
who sent this? - Gonna open it? Read it.
it seems that someone opened it already. - Not me.
you didn't open it already? - No.
you are not a good liar.
aloud.
dear Mr. Tolson. Thank you for informing us about your historical victory...Oklahoma City.
I'm sure we realize how season is nearly over, but today we receive another letter from Wiley College, written by Mr. Henry Lowe with an "e."
he told us that the students prospective about your...
...about your undefeated season. Well, we are not undefeted any more.
don't matter. We wish to extend invitation to...
we wish to extend invitation to debate Harvard Crimson,
here in Cambridge.
let us know if it's agreeable to you.
you shouldn't tell anybody.
no.
you don't have to thank me.
I just wanted to show you I could write too.
yes good, thank you.
you could do me a favor. - What's that?
he keeps Samantha in team...
why I wanna do that?
Mr. Tolson it was raw night. - Yes it was, Mr. Lowe.
for all of us.
and she walked out of us last minute.
not sir. She did not walk out of us.
she walked out of me.
it's good team.
resolved:
capitalism is a moral you will be arguing the affirmative.
to a bunch Wall Street bankers.
Mr. Tolson, I owe you and my teammate...
you're late, come in, sit down.
Samantha, I am not...
resolved.
you've got macaroni and cheese, roast chicken, black peas for good luck, red beans and rice, corn bread, candy canes, I put some piececolor bean too.
and red pudding too
I know that you don't like pudding but I put it anyway.
thank you mom.
OK. - Good luck son.
dad... - Yes, Junior.
you get Boston the Marry Gods, - yeah? - Yes sir.
come on, train's leaving.
coming.
bye mom. - Bye bye.
I love you. - I love you too. All aboard.
I'm not going with you.
what?
I can not leave the state it's conditions of my bail.
can't let them stop you. - They do not stopped me.
I just don't wanna just risk your opportunity.
you didn't want without me, this is what you wanted to do all alone. Isn't it?
it's right.
why didn't tell us before?
because I don't wonna hear your arguments, I knew that would be too good.
all right Mr. Lowe you are in charged.
whatever your instinct tell you, you listen.
yes sir. - Let's go.
what we supposed to do without you?
win.
I thought someone supposed to meet us.
Wiley College?
Yes.
I'm Harland Osbourne. Harvard charged me for the time you are here in Boston.
Hi, I am Henry Lowe.
Mr. Lowe. - James Farmer Junior. - Mr. Farmer.
Samantha Booke. - Of course, Miss Booke.
we should be going, my car is up front.
I've got it. - Thank you.
just so you know we staying on campus in Douglas Hall.
I gonna tell you this debate strining up a lot of excitement.
Really? - Oh yeah. It's gonna be broadcast all over America.
can we see where we gonna debate? - Of course.
hello Harvard.
excuse me.
you suppose to be here?
I guess we find out. Won't we?
look, Mr. Farmer.
5 dollars?
lowe, I've got 5 dollars.
Yes, I did too. It's co-op them.
you want me hold it for you? - No, not my 5 dollars.
I've got 5 dollars.
I've got 5 dollars. - Me too.

when you have to use the mask... But is that ...
read, James, but we'll save it for the red button. We gona save the best for last.
because you have to... You have to lead the honest...
I think we should include this Ghandi concept with Sucher Graha...
I don't agree, I don't think people can understand with Sucher Graha...
Sucher graha.
from the sanscrite, meaning truth and fairless.
I told you.
it's obvious to me that we should begin debate with Ghandi.
that's exactly what I won't do it. Why should I do the obvious thing? Because that's what wins debate.
listen what you saying, this is Harvard, ok?
the first you think say that, it which means disobedience... - But Ghandi is a strong poet.
I wanna win. Do you wanna win?
Yes, I wanna win. This is not getting us the way out.
Tolson told me I was in charge.
ain't put you in charge. And put me in charge, so I make the decision. We will not starting with Ghandi.
you are a kid. - You are an idiot.
you are an idiot. - Am I an idiot? - Yes, you are an idiot.

judges will love you. - No, you can't quit.
I'm not quiting Samantha.
Tolson made me captain, and I said that you are ready.
you saw me how Harvard was horrible.
that's right. You did horrible, didn't you? Stuck up the whole joint. Right?
so she just quit, right, she just gave up?
no.
who is the judge?
what?
who is the judge?
judge is God.
and why is he God?
cause he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent.
who is your opponent?
he doesn't exist.
why doesn't he exist?
cause he is a mute distant voice the truth that I speak.
that's right.
speak the truth.
directly from Harvard, Memorial Hall in Cambridge Massuchusetts, This is the WNBC Radio, bringing to you live tonight history making debate.
between little Wiley College, from Marshall Texas,
and the Harvard University debate team.
the first time ever when negro college has faced the national champions Harvard. Students making wait to the podium now, the crowd is on cute fall silent.
on this historical occasion,
we welcome the distinguished team from Wiley College.
presenting the judges, through the audience, and through the wonder of radio, the nation.
harvard University celebrates 300 annniwersary this year.
and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt, it's 5th President of the US.
but no University, no matter how grand or gostent is his history,
can't afford to live in the past,
so in the spirit of tomorrow,
I itroduce to you today,
the debaters from Wiley College.
miss Samantha Booke Mr. James Farmer Junior.
Mr. Farmer will argue the first affirmative.
resolved: Civil disobedience is a moral weapon in the fight for justice.
but how can disobedience have been moral?
I guess that's depend on once definition of the words.
word.
in 1919 in India, 10thousand people gathered, In Amritsar to protest the tyranny British rule.
has it started?
your brother's talking, just sit down.
general Reginald Dyer, traped in the courtyard,
in order his troops to fireing to the crowd for 10 minutes.
379 died.
men, women, children, shot down in cold blood.
dyer said he taught them a moral lesson.
ghandi in his follow was responded not with violence,
but with organised campaign of non-cooperation.
government buildings were occupied, Street was blocked by people who refused to raise.
even by being beaten by police.
gandhi was arrested.
but the British was soon force to release him.
he called it "a moral victory."
the definition of moral:
dyer's lesson, or Ghandi's victory?
you choose.
from 1914 to 1918,
for every single minute the world was at war.
4 men laid down their lives.
just think of it.
240 brave young men, Were sentenced to eternity every hour of every day,
of every night for 4 long years.
35 thousand hours.
8, 281, 000 casualties.
240
240
240
here was a slaughter immeasurable greater that what happened in Amritsar.
can be anything moral about it?
nothing.
except that's up the Germany from enslaving all of Europe.
civil disobedience isn't moral because it's not violent.
fighting for your country with violence can be deeply moral.
demanding the greatest sacrifice of all.
life itself.
non-violence, is the mask civil disobedience wears To conceal it's true face.
and anarchy.
gandhi believes one must always act
with love and respect for ones opponents.
even if they are Harvard debaters.
gandhi also believes that law breakers, Must accept the legal consequences for their actions.
does it sounds like an anarchy?
civil disobedience is not something for us to fear.
it is after all an American concept.
you see Gandhi draw his inspiration not from the Hindu Scripture,
but from Henry David Thoreau who I believe graduated from Harvard, And live by upon not too far from here.
my opponent is right about one thing.
Drough was a Harvard grade,
and like many of us,
a bit so biased.
he wants said:
any man more right that his neighbors... ...constuit a majority of one.
thoreau the ideals could never know,
the Adolf Hitler was agree with his words.
the beauty and burden of democracy is this:
no idea prevails without the support of the majority."
the people decide the moral issue of the day,
not a majority of one.
majorities do not decide what is right or wrong.
your conscience does.
so why should us citizens, surrender his a hook conscience To a legacy.
we must never, ever kneel down. Before the theory of a majority.
we can't decide which laws to obey, which to ignore.
if we could,
I never stop for the red light.
my father is one of those men that stand between us and chaos.
a police officer.
I remember the day his partner,
his best friend, Was gone down in the line of duty.
most vividly of all,
I remember the expression on my dads face.
Nothing...That rolls the rule of law can be moral.
no matter what name we give it.
why doesn't he say something?
in Texas...
...they lynch negroes.
my teammate and I, Saw a man strung by his neck.
and sat on fire.
we drove to the lynch mop.
press their faces against the floor board.
I looked at my teammates.
I saw fear in their eyes.
and worse, the shame.
what was this negro's crime?
that he should be hung without trial, in a dark forest fill with fog.
was he a thief?
was he a killer?
or just a negro?
was he a sharecropper?
a preacher?
where his children waiting up for him?
and who will wait just lay there.
and do nothing.
no matter what he did, the mop was the criminal.
but the law did nothing,
just left us wondering: Why?
my opponent says: "Nothing that is break the rule of law can be moral.
but there is no rule in the law in Gambro South.
now we negroes...are denied housing, turn away from schools, hospitals, and not we are rynched.
St. Augustine said:
an unjust law is no law at all.
which means I have a right, even a duty to resist.
with violence or civil disobedience...
you should pray I choose the later.
in tonight debate, Between Harvard University,
and Wiley College.
and the winner is...
Wiley College.
just 7 years later in 1942 James Farmer Junior ounded the Congress of Racial Equality.
and became a leader in the civil rights movement.
after a long life of teaching and writing.
James Farmer Sr. passed away in 1961.
on the day before Samantha Booke, a lawyer, took the first Freedom Ride to Alabama.
Henry Lowe went on study theology at the University of California. and became a minister.
Melvin Tolson became a world renowned poet.
he continues his work with Southern Yenant Farmers' Union.
by the end of 1936, it had 31000 members in seven states.
for ten years the Wiley College debate team went undefeated.
Lydia! Kitty!
my dear Mr Bennet, have you heard?
Netherfield Park is let at last. Do you not want to know who has taken it?
as you wish to tell me, my dear, I doubt I have any choice in the matter.
Kitty, what have I told you about listening at the door?
there's a Mr Bingley arrived from the North.
five thousand a year! - Really?
he's single! - Who's single?
a Mr Bingley, apparently. Kitty!
how can that possibly affect them?
mr Bennet, how can you be so tiresome?
you know he must marry one of them.
that is his design in settling here?
you must go and visit him at once.
good heavens. People.
for we may not visit if you do not, as you well know, Mr Bennet - Are you listening? You never listen. - You must, Papa! At once!
there's no need. I already have.
you have? - When?
Oh, Mr Bennet, - how can you tease me so?
have you no compassion for my poor nerves?
you mistake me, my dear. I have the highest respect for them.
they've been my constant companions these twenty years.
Papa!
is he amiable? - Who?
is he handsome? - He's sure to be.
with 5, 000 pounds a year, it would not matter if he had warts.
who's got warts?
I will consent to his marrying whichever girl he chooses.
so will he come to the ball tomorrow? - I believe so.
mr Bennet! - I have to have your muslin!
I'll lend you my green slippers! - They were mine.
I'll do your mending for a week. I'll retrim your new bonnet.
two weeks I'll do it for.
it's not the same! It's not the same.
I can't breathe.
I think one of my toes just came off.
if every man does not end the evening in love with you, then I'm no judge of beauty.
or men. - No, they are far too easy to judge.
they're not all bad.
humourless poppycocks, in my limited experience.
one day, someone will catch your eye and then you'll have to watch your tongue.
how good of you to come.
which of the painted peacocks is our Mr Bingley?
he's on the right. On the left is his sister.
the person with the quizzical brow? - That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.
he looks miserable, poor soul. - He may be, but poor he is not.
tell me.
10, 000 pounds a year, and he owns half of Derbyshire.
the miserable half.
mr Bennet, you must introduce him to the girls immediately.
smile at Mr Bingley. Smile.
Mary.
mr Bingley, my eldest daughter you know.
Mrs Bennet, Miss Jane Bennet, Elizabeth and Miss Mary Bennet.
it is a pleasure. I have two others, but they're already dancing.
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.
and may I introduce Mr Darcy of Pemberley in Derbyshire.
how do you like it here in Hertfordshire?
very much.
the library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest.
it fills me with guilt. I'm not a good reader. I prefer being out of doors.
Oh, I mean, I can read, of course.
and I'm not suggesting you can't read out of doors.
I wish I read more, but there seem to be so many other things to do.
that's exactly what I meant.
mama, Mama! You will never, ever believe what we're about to tell you.
tell me! - She's going to take the veil.
the regiment are coming! - Officers?
they're going to be stationed the whole winter, right here.
officers? - As far as the eye can see.
Oh, look. Jane's dancing with Mr Bingley.
mr Bennet.
do you dance, Mr Darcy? - Not if I can help it.
I didn't know you were coming to see me. What's the matter?
we are a long way from Grosvenor Square, are we not, Mr Darcy?
I've never seen so many pretty girls.
you were dancing with the only handsome girl.
she is the most beautiful creature I have ever beheld.
but her sister Elizabeth is agreeable. - Perfectly tolerable
not handsome enough to tempt me. Return to your partner and enjoy her smiles.
you're wasting your time with me.
count your blessings, Lizzie. If he liked you, you'd have to talk to him.
precisely.
I wouldn't dance with him for all of Derbyshire,
Iet alone the miserable half.
wait!
I enjoyed that so much, Miss Lucas. - How well you dance, Mr Bingley.
I've never enjoyed a dance so much.
my daughter Jane is a splendid dancer, is she not?
she is indeed.
your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing young woman.
Oh, yes, I adore her.
it is a pity she's not more handsome. - Mama!
Oh, but Lizzie would never admit that she's plain.
of course, it's my Jane who's considered the beauty of the county.
mama, please!
when she was 1 5, a gentleman was so much in love with her,
I was sure he would make her an offer.
however, he did write her some very pretty verses.
and that put paid to it.
I wonder who discovered the power of poetry in driving away love.
I thought poetry was the food of love. - Of a fine, stout love.
but if it is only a vague inclination, one poor sonnet will kill it.
so, what do you recommend to encourage affection?
dancing. Even if one's partner is barely tolerable.
mr Bingley is just whata young man ought to be.
sensible, good-humoured... - Handsome, conveniently rich...
marriage should not be driven by thoughts of money.
only deep love will persuade me to marry.
which is why I'll end up an old maid. - Do you really believe he liked me?
he danced with you most of the night, and stared at you the rest.
I give you leave to like him. You've liked many stupider.
you're a great deal too apt to like people in general.
all the world is good in your eyes.
not his friend. I still can't believe what he said about you.
mr Darcy?
I'd more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine.
but no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again.
he danced with Miss Lucas.
we were all there, dear.
it is a shame she's not more handsome.
there's a spinster in the making and no mistake.
the fourth with a Miss King of little standing, and the fifth again with Jane.
if he had any compassion, he would've sprained his ankle.
the way you carry on, you'd think our girls look forward to a grand inheritance.
when you die, which may be very soon, they will be left without a roof over their head nor a penny to their name.
please, it's ten in the morning. - A letter to Miss Bennet, madam.
from Netherfield Hall.
praise the Lord. We are saved!
make haste, Jane, make haste. Oh, happy day!
it is from Caroline Bingley.
she has invited me to dine with her.
her brother will be dining out. - Dining out?
can I take the carriage? - Let me see.
it is too far to walk. - This is unaccountable of him.
mama, the carriage for Jane?
horseback!
Lizzie.
now she'll have to stay the night, exactly as I predicted.
good grief, woman, your skills in the art of matchmaking are positively occult.
though I don't think, Mama, you can take credit for making it rain.
my friends will not hear of me returning home until I am better.
excepting a sore throat, a fever and a headache, nothing is wrong with me." It's ridiculous.
if Jane does die it will be a comfort to know it was in pursuit of Mr Bingley.
people do not die of colds.
but she may perish with the shame of having such a mother.
I must go to Netherfield at once.
lady Bathurst is redecorating her ballroom in the French style.
a little unpatriotic, don't you think?
miss Elizabeth Bennet.
good Lord, did you walk here?
I did.
I'm so sorry. How is my sister? - She's upstairs.
thank you.
my goodness, did you see her hem? Six inches deep in mud.
she looked positively mediaeval.
I feel such a terrible imposition. They're being so kind to me.
I don't know who is more pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.
thank you for tending to my sister so diligently.
she's in far better comfort than at home.
it's a pleasure.
I mean, it's not a pleasure that she's ill. Of course not.
it's a pleasure that she's here, being ill.
not going to be famous, our pig.
black on the back, but not related to the learned pig of Norwich.
now that pig is... - Mr Bennet.
it's all going to plan. He's half in love with her already.
who is, blossom? - Mr Bingley.
he doesn't mind that she hasn't a penny.
he has more than enough for the two of them.
how will we meet them? Easy!
wait for me!
you drop something. They pick it up. And then you're introduced.
officers!
you write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.
you're mistaken. I write slowly.
how many letters you must have occasion to write, Mr Darcy.
letters of business. How odious I should think them.
it is fortunate, then, they fall to me and not you.
tell your sister I long to see her.
I've already told her once. - I do dote on her.
I was quite in raptures at her beautiful design for a table.
perhaps you will give me leave to defer your raptures.
I have not room enough to do them justice.
you young ladies are so accomplished.
what do you mean? - You paint tables, play the piano and embroider cushions.
I never heard of a lady, but people say she's accomplished.
the word is applied too liberally.
I do not know more than half a dozen women - that are truly accomplished. - Nor I.
goodness, you must comprehend a great deal in the idea.
I do. - Absolutely.
she must have a knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word.
and something in her air and manner of walking.
and she must improve her mind by extensive reading.
I'm no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.
I wonder at you knowing any. - Are you so severe on your own sex?
I never saw such a woman. She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.
miss Elizabeth, let us take a turn about the room.
it's refreshing, is it not, after sitting so long in one attitude?
it is a small kind of accomplishment, I suppose.
will you not join us, Mr Darcy?
you can only have two motives, and I would interfere with either.
what can he mean?
the surest way to disappoint him would be to ask him nothing.
do tell us, Mr Darcy.
either you are in each other's confidence and you have secret affairs to discuss, or you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage by walking.
if the first, I should get in your way.
if the second, I can admire you much better from here.
we could laugh at him. - No. Mr Darcy is not to be teased.
are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would you consider pride a fault or a virtue?
I couldn't say. - We're trying to find a fault in you.
I find it hard to forgive the follies and vices of others, or their offences against me.
my good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.
Oh, dear. I cannot tease you about that.
what a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.
a family trait, I think.
a Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet, a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.
are we to receive every Bennet in the country?
what an excellent room you have, sir.
such expensive furnishings.
I do hope you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.
absolutely, I find the country very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?
I find it perfectly adequate.
even if society is a little less varied than in town.
less varied? Not at all.
we dine with four and 20 families of all shapes and sizes.
sir William Lucas, for instance, is a very agreeable man.
and a good deal less self-important than some people half his rank.
mr Bingley, is it true you will hold a ball here?
a ball?
it would be an excellent way to meet new friends. You could invite the militia.
Oh, do hold a ball! - Kitty!
when your sister recovers, you shall name the day.
I think a ball is an irrational way to gain new acquaintance.
it would be better if conversation, not dancing, were the order of the day.
indeed, much more rational, but rather less like a ball.
thank you, Mary.
what a fine imposing place to be sure, is it not, my dears?
there's no house to equal it in the county.
mr Darcy. - Miss Bennet.
there she is. - I don't know how to thank you.
you're welcome any time you feel the least bit poorly.
thank you for your stimulating company. Most instructive.
not at all. The pleasure is all mine.
mr Darcy. - Miss Elizabeth.
and then there was one with great long lashes, like a cow.
ask Mrs Hill to order us a sirloin, Betsy.
just the one, mind. We're not made of money.
I hope, my dear, you've ordered a good dinner today.
I've reason to expect an addition to our family party.
his name's Mr Collins, the dreaded cousin.
who is to inherit? - Everything.
even my piano stool belongs to Mr Collins.
when?
he may turn us out of the house as soon as he pleases.
the estate passes directly to him and not to us poor females.
mr Collins, at your service.
what a superbly featured room and what excellent potatoes.
it's many years since I've had such an exemplary vegetable.
to which fair cousin should I compliment the excellence of the cooking?
we are perfectly able to keep a cook.
excellent.
I'm very pleased the estate can afford such a living.
I'm honoured to have as my patroness Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
you've heard of her, I presume?
my small rectory abuts her estate,
Rosings Park, and she often condescends to drive by my humble dwelling in her little phaeton and ponies.
does she have any family?
one daughter, the heiress of Rosings and very extensive property.
I've often observed to Lady Catherine that her daughter seemed born to be a duchess, for she has all the superior graces of elevated rank.
these kind of compliments are always acceptable to the ladies, and which I conceive myself particularly bound to pay.
how happy for you, Mr Collins, to possess the talent for flattering with such delicacy.
do these attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are they the result of previous study?
they arise from what is passing at the time.
and though I do sometimes amuse myself with arranging such little compliments,
I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.
Oh, believe me, no one would suspect your manners to be rehearsed.
after dinner, I thought I might read to you for an hour or two.
I have with me Fordyce's Sermons which speak very eloquently on all matters moral.
are you familiar with Fordyce's Sermons, Miss Bennet?
Mrs Bennet, I have been bestowed by the good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourgh a parsonage of no mean size.
I have become aware of the fact.
it is my avowed hope that soon I may find a mistress for it.
and I have to inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet has captured my special attention.
Oh, Mr Collins.
unfortunately, it is incumbent upon me to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet is very soon to be engaged.
engaged.
but Miss Lizzie, next to her in age and beauty, would make anyone an excellent partner.
do not you agree? Mr Collins?
indeed. Indeed.
a very agreeable alternative.
mr Collins is a man who makes you despair at the entire sex.
yours, I believe. - Oh, Mr Wickham, how perfect you are.
he picked up my handkerchief. Did you drop yours on purpose?
mr Wickham is a lieutenant.
an enchanted lieutenant. - What are you up to, Liddy?
we happened to be looking for ribbon. -White, for the ball.
shall we all look for some ribbon together?
good afternoon, Mr James. - Miss Lydia, Miss Bennet.
I shan't even browse.
I can't be trusted. I have poor taste in ribbons.
only a truly confident man would admit that.
no, it's true.
and buckles. When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.
you must be the shame of the regiment. The laughing stock.
what do your superiors do with you?
ignore me. I'm of next to no importance, so it's easily done.
Lizzie, lend me some money. - You already owe me a fortune.
allow me to oblige. - No, Mr Wickham, please...
I insist.
I pity the French. - So do l.
look, Mr Bingley. - Mr Bingley!
I was just on my way to your house.
how do you like my ribbons for your ball?
very beautiful. - She is. Look, she's blooming.
Oh, Lydia.
be sure to invite Mr Wickham. He is a credit to his profession.
you can't invite people to other people's balls.
of course, you must come, Mr Wickham.
if you'll excuse me, ladies, enjoy the day.
do you plan to go to the Netherfield ball,
perhaps. How long has Mr Darcy been a guest there?
about a month.
forgive me, but are you acquainted with him, with Mr Darcy?
indeed, I've been connected with his family since infancy.
you may well be surprised, given our cold greeting this afternoon.
I hope your plans in favour of Meryton will not be affected - by your relations with the gentleman. - It is not for me to be driven away.
if he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go, not I.
I must ask, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?
my father managed his estate.
we grew up together, Darcy and I.
his father treated me like a second son, loved me like a son.
we were both with him the day he died.
with his last breath, his father bequeathed me the rectory in his estate.
he knew I had my heart set on joining the Church.
but Darcy ignored his wishes and gave the living to another man.
but why? - Jealousy.
his father...
well, he loved me better and Darcy couldn't stand it.
how cruel. - So now I'm a poor foot-soldier.
too lowly even to be noticed.
breathe in! - I can't anymore. You're hurting.
Betsy.
Betsy!
there must've been a misunderstanding. - Jane, you never think ill of anybody.
how could Mr Darcy do such a thing?
I will discover the truth from Mr Bingley this evening.
let Mr Darcy contradict it himself.
till he does, I hope never to encounter him.
poor, unfortunate, Mr Wickham.
Wickham is twice the man Darcy is.
and, let us hope, a rather more willing dancer.
there they are, look.
Oh, yes. - Billy.
Jane Martin is here.
may I say what an immense pleasure it is to see you again.
Mrs Bennet. - Miss Bingley.
charming.
I'm so pleased you're here.
so am I.
and how are you? Miss Elizabeth? Are you looking for someone?
no, not at all, I was just admiring the general splendour.
it is breathtaking, Mr Bingley. - Good.
you might have passed a few pleasantries with Mr Bingley.
I've never met a more pleasant gentleman in all my years.
did you see how he dotes on her?
dear Jane, always doing what's best for her family.
Charlotte! - Lizzie!
have you seen Mr Wickham? - No. Perhaps he's through here.
Lizzie, Mr Wickham is not here. Apparently, he's been detained.
detained where? He must be here.
there you are. - Mr Collins.
perhaps you will do me the honour, Miss Elizabeth.
Oh, I did not think you danced, Mr Collins.
I do not think it incompatible with the office of a clergyman.
several people, her Ladyship included, have complimented me on my lightness of foot.
apparently, your Mr Wickham has been called on some business to town.
dancing is of little consequence to me, but it does...
...but it does afford the opportunity to lavish...
... Upon one's partner attentions... - ...My informer tells me...
...that he would be less inclined to be engaged, were it not for...
...the presence of a certain gentleman.
which is my primary object.
that gentleman barely warrants the name.
it is my intention, if I may be so bold, to remain close to you throughout the evening.
may I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth?
you may.
did I agree to dance with Mr Darcy? - I dare say you will find him amiable.
it would be most inconvenient since I've sworn to loathe him for all eternity.
I love this dance. - lndeed. Most invigorating.
it is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy.
I talked about the dance.
now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples.
I'm perfectly happy to oblige. What would you like most to hear?
that reply will do for present.
perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.
for now, we may remain silent.
do you talk as a rule while dancing?
no. No, I prefer to be unsociable and taciturn.
makes it all so much more enjoyable, don't you think?
tell me, do you and your sisters very often walk to Meryton?
Yes, we often walk to Meryton.
it's a great opportunity to meet new people.
when you met us, we'd just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.
mr Wickham's blessed with such happy manners, he's sure of making friends.
whether he's capable of retaining them is less so.
he's been so unfortunate as to lose your friendship. That is irreversible?
it is. Why do you ask such a question? - To make out your character.
what have you discovered? - Very little.
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.
I hope to afford you more clarity in the future.
is that Mr Darcy of Pemberley? - I believe so.
I must make myself known to him.
he's a nephew of my patroness, Lady Catherine.
he will consider it an impertinence.
mr Darcy.
mr Darcy.
mr Darcy. Good evening...
what interesting relatives you have.
Mary, dear, you've delighted us long enough.
let the other young ladies have a turn.
...Since I was a child, and then she died.
I have a beautiful grey.
of course, Caroline's a much better rider than l, of course.
Oh, yes. We fully expect a most advantageous marriage.
and my Jane, marrying so grand, must throw her sisters in the way.
clearly my family are seeing who can expose themselves to the most ridicule.
at least Bingley has not noticed. - No.
I think he likes her very much. - But does she like him?
few of us are secure enough to be in love without proper encouragement.
Bingley likes her enormously, but might not do more if she does not help him on.
she's just shy. If he cannot perceive her regard, he is a fool.
we are all fools in love.
he does not know her character as we do.
she should move fast and snap him up.
there is plenty of time for us to get to know him afterwards.
I can't help feeling that someone's going to produce a piglet and make us chase it.
Oh, dear! - I do apologise, sir.
I'm awfully sorry. Do forgive me.
Emily, please!
Mary, my dear Mary. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
I've been practising all week. - I know, my dear.
I hate balls.
mr Bennet, wake up.
Oh, I've never had such a good time!
Charles, you cannot be serious.
we'll have a wedding here in less than three months if you ask me, Mr Bennet.
mr Bennet!
Mary, please.
thank you, Mr Hill.
Mrs Bennet, I was hoping, if it would not trouble you, that I might solicit a private audience with Miss Elizabeth.
Oh, certainly, Lizzie would be very happy indeed.
everyone, out. Mr Collins would like a private audience with your sister.
wait, Mr Collins can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.
I desire you will stay where you are. Everyone else to the drawing room.
mr Bennet. - But...
now.
Jane. Jane, don't... Jane! - Jane.
Papa, stay.
dear Miss Elizabeth,
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.
almost as soon as I entered the house,
I singled you out as the companion of my future life.
but before I am run away with my feelings, perhaps I may state my reasons for marrying.
firstly, that it is the duty of a clergyman to set the example of matrimony in his parish.
secondly, I am convinced it will add greatly to my happiness.
and thirdly, that it is at the urging of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine, that I select a wife.
my object in coming to Longbourn was to choose such a one from among Mr Bennet's daughters, for I am to inherit the estate and such an alliance will surely suit everyone.
and now nothing remains but for me to assure you in the most animated language - of the violence of my affections. - Mr Collins!
and no reproach on the subject of fortune - will cross my lips once we're married. - You forget I have given no answer.
when I speak to her of your modesty, economy and other amiable qualities.
lady Catherine will thoroughly approve
sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but I regret that I must decline it.
I know ladies don't seek to seem too eager...
mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You could not make me happy.
and I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy.
I flatter myself that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy.
besides, despite manifold attractions, it is by no means certain another offer of marriage will ever be made to you.
I must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.
I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man.
please understand me, I cannot accept you.
headstrong, foolish child.
don't worry, Mr Collins. We'll have this little hiccup dealt with immediately.
Lizzie. Lizzie!
mr Bennet, we're all in an uproar!
you must come and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins.
mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie, but she vowed she will not have him, and now the danger is
mr Collins may not have Lizzie.
what am I to do? - Well, come and talk to her.
now!
tell her you insist they marry. - Papa, please.
you will have this house and save your sisters from destitution.
I can't marry him. - Go and say you've changed your mind.
think of your family. - You cannot make me.
mr Bennet, say something.
your mother insists upon you marrying Mr Collins.
Yes, or I shall never see her again.
from this day onward, you must be a stranger to one of your parents.
who will maintain you when your father is dead?
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.
thank you, Papa.
ungrateful child! I shall never speak to you again.
not that I take much pleasure in talking.
people who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no pleasure in talking to anybody.
Jane!
what's the matter? Jane?
I don't understand what would take him from Netherfield.
why does he not know when he'll return?
read it.
mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and we are scarcely less eager.
I do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance and accomplishment. I hope to call her hereafter my sister.
is that not clear enough?
Caroline sees her brother in love with you and has taken him off to persuade him otherwise.
but I know her to be incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone.
it's more likely he does not love me. - He loves you. Do not give up.
go to our aunt and uncle's in London,
let it be known you are there and I am sure he will come to you.
give my love to my sister and try not to be a burden, dear.
poor Jane.
still, a girl likes to be crossed in love now and then.
it gives her something to think of and a sort of distinction amongst her companions.
I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa. - It's your turn now, Lizzie.
you've turned down Collins.
you're free to go off and be jilted yourself.
what about Mr Wickham?
he's a pleasant fellow and he'd do the job credibly.
father... - And you have an affectionate mother who would make the most of it.
Charlotte! - My dear Lizzie.
I've come her to tell you the news. Mr Collins and I are... engaged.
engaged? - Yes.
to be married? - What other kind of engaged is there?
for heaven's sake, Lizzie, don't look at me like that.
I should be as happy with him as any other.
but he's ridiculous. - Oh, hush.
not all of us can afford to be romantic.
I've been offered a comfortable home and protection.
there's a lot to be thankful for.
I'm 27 years old. I've no money and no prospects.
I'm already a burden to my parents.
and I'm frightened.
so don't judge me, Lizzie. Don't you dare judge me.
dear Charlotte, thank you for your letter.
I'm glad the house, furniture and roads are to your taste, and that Lady Catherine's behaviour is friendly and obliging
what with your departure, Jane's to London and the militia to the North with the colourful Mr Wickham,
I must confess, the view from where I sit has been rather grey.
as for the favour you ask, it is no favour at all.
I would be happy to visit you at your earliest convenience.
welcome to our humble abode.
my wife encourages me to spend time in the garden for my health.
I think our guest is tired after her journey.
I plan many improvements. I intend to throw out a bough and plant a lime walk.
I flatter myself that any young lady would be happy to be the mistress of such a house.
we shan't be disturbed here.
this parlour is for my own particular use.
Oh, Lizzie, it's such a pleasure to run my own home.
Charlotte, come here! - What's happened?
has the pig escaped again? Oh, it's Lady Catherine.
come and see, Lizzie.
great news.
we received an invitation to Rosings from Lady Catherine.
how wonderful!
do not make yourself uneasy about your apparel.
just put on the best you've brought.
lady Catherine's never been averse to the truly humble.
one of the most extraordinary sights in all of Europe.
the glazing alone costs upwards of 20, 000 pounds.
come along. Come along.
a little later we'll play cards.
your Ladyship.
miss de Bourgh.
so, you are Elizabeth Bennet? - I am, your Ladyship.
this is my daughter.
it's kind of you to ask us to dine. - The rug alone cost upwards of 300 pounds.
mr Darcy.
what are you doing here?
mr Darcy, I had no idea we had the honour.
miss Elizabeth, I'm a guest here. - You know my nephew?
I had the pleasure of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.
Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?
mr Collins, you can't sit next to your wife. Move. Over there.
Harvey, I wonder, could you get me the fish course...
I trust your family is in good health, Miss Elizabeth?
they are, thank you.
my eldest sister is in London. Perhaps you saw her there.
I haven't been fortunate enough...
do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet?
a little, ma'am, and very poorly. - Do you draw?
no, not at all.
your sisters, do they draw?
not one.
that's very strange.
I suppose you had no opportunity.
your mother should've taken you to town for the benefit of the masters.
my mother wouldn't have minded, but my father hates town.
has your governess left you? - We never had a governess.
no governess? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess?
I never heard such a thing. Your mother must've been a slave to your education.
not at all, Lady Catherine.
your younger sisters, are they out in society?
Yes, ma'am, all. - All?
what, all five out at once? That's very odd.
and you second. The younger ones out before the elders are married?
your youngest sisters must be very young.
Yes, my youngest is not 16
but it would be hard on younger sisters not to have their amusement because the elder is still unmarried.
it would hardly encourage sisterly affection.
upon my word, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.
pray, what is your age?
with three younger sisters grown up, you can hardly expect me to own to it.
come, Miss Bennet, and play for us.
no, I beg you. - For music is my delight.
in fact, there are few people in England who have more true enjoyment of music.
or better natural taste.
if I had ever learnt, I should've been a great proficient.
so would Anne, if her health would've allowed her.
I'm not afflicted with false modesty, when I say I play poorly...
come, Lizzie, her Ladyship demands it.
how does Georgiana get along, Darcy?
she plays very well. - I hope she practises.
no excellence can be acquired without constant practice.
I've told Mrs Collins this.
though you have no instrument, you're welcome to come to Rosings and play on the pianoforte in the housekeeper's room.
you'll be in nobody's way in that part of the house.
you mean to frighten me by coming in all your state to hear me.
but I won't be alarmed, even if your sister does play so well.
I know that I cannot alarm you even should I wish it.
what was my friend like in Hertfordshire?
you really care to know?
prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
the first time I saw him, he danced with nobody, though gentlemen were scarce and there was more than one lady without a partner.
I knew nobody beyond my own party. - Nobody can be introduced at a ball.
Fitzwilliam, I need you.
I do not have the talent of conversing easily with people I have never met before.
perhaps you should take your aunt's advice and practise.
dear Jane...
mr Darcy.
please, do be seated.
mr and Mrs Collins have gone to the village.
this is a charming house.
I believe my aunt did a great deal to it when Mr Collins first arrived.
I believe so.
she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful subject.
shall I call for some tea? - No, thank you.
good day, Miss Elizabeth, it's been a pleasure.
what on earth have you done to poor Mr Darcy?
I have no idea.
every mind must have some counsellor to whom it may apply for consolation in distress.
there are many conveniences which others can supply and we cannot procure.
I have in view those objects which are only to be obtained through intercourse...
forgive me, through the intercourse of friendship or civility.
on such occasions, the proud man steps forth to meet you not with cordiality, but with the suspicion of one who reconnoitres an enemy...
how long do you plan to stay? - As long as Darcy chooses.
I am at his disposal. - Everyone appears to be.
I wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind.
she would be a lucky woman. - Really?
Darcy is a most loyal companion.
he recently came to the rescue of one of his friends.
what happened?
he saved him from an imprudent marriage.
who's the man?
his closest friend, Charles Bingley.
did Mr Darcy give a reason for this interference?
there were apparently strong objections to the lady.
what kind of objections? Her lack of fortune?
I think it was her family that was considered unsuitable.
so he separated them? - I believe so. I know nothing else
miss Elizabeth.
I have struggled in vain and can bear it no longer.
these past months have been a torment. I came to Rosings only to see you.
I have fought against judgement, my family's expectation, the inferiority of your birth, my rank.
I will put them aside and ask you to end my agony.
I don't understand. - I love you.
most ardently.
please do me the honour of accepting my hand.
sir, I appreciate the struggle you have been through, and I am very sorry to have caused you pain.
it was unconsciously done.
is this your reply? - Yes, sir.
are you laughing at me? - No.
are you rejecting me?
I'm sure the feelings which hindered your regard will help you overcome it.
might I ask why with so little civility I am thus repulsed?
I might enquire why you told me you liked me against your better judgement?
if I was uncivil, then that is some excuse.
but you know I have other reasons. - What reasons?
do you think anything might tempt me - to accept the man who has ruined the happiness of a most beloved sister?
do you deny that you separated a young couple who loved each other, exposing your friend to censure for caprice and my sister to derision for disappointed hopes, involving them both in acute misery?
I do not deny it. - How could you do it?
I believed your sister indifferent to him.
I realised his attachment was deeper than hers.
she's shy!
Bingley was persuaded she didn't feel strongly.
you suggested it. - For his own good.
my sister hardly shows her true feelings to me.
I suppose his fortune had some bearing?
I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour.
it was suggested... - What was?
it was clear an advantageous marriage...
did my sister give that impression? - No!
no. There was, however, your family... - Our want of connection?
no, it was more than that. - How, sir?
the lack of propriety shown by your mother, younger sisters and your father.
forgive me. You and your sister I must exclude from this.
and what about Mr Wickham?
mr Wickham?
what excuse can you give for your behaviour?
you take an eager interest. - He told me of his misfortunes.
Oh, they have been great. - You ruin his chances yet treat him with sarcasm.
so this is your opinion of me?
thank you. Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my scruples about our relationship.
I am to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances?
and those are the words of a gentleman.
your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain for the feelings of others made me realise you were the last man in the world I could ever marry.
forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time.
I came to leave you this.
I shall not renew the sentiments which were so disgusting to you.
but if I may, I will address the two offences you have laid against me.
my father loved Mr Wickham as a son.
he left him a generous living. But upon my father's death,
mr Wickham announced he had no intention of taking orders.
he demanded the value of the living, which he'd gambled away within weeks.
he then wrote, demanding more money, which I refused.
after which, he severed all acquaintance.
he came back to see us last summer, and declared passionate love for my sister, whom he tried to persuade to elope with him.
she is to inherit 30, 000 pounds.
when it was made clear he would never receive a penny of it, he disappeared.
I will not attempt to convey the depth of Georgiana's despair.
she was 15 years old.
as to the other matter, of your sister and Mr Bingley, though the motives which governed me may appear insufficient, they were in the service of a friend.
Lizzie.
are you all right?
I hardly know.
Lizzie. How fortunate you have arrived.
your aunt and uncle are here to deliver Jane from London.
how is Jane? - She's in the drawing room.
I'm quite over him. If he passed me in the street, I'd hardly notice.
london is so diverting. It's true.
there's so much to entertain.
what news from Kent?
nothing.
at least not much to entertain.
Lizzie, tell Mama!
stop making such a fuss.
why didn't she ask me as well? - Because I'm better company.
what's the matter? - I've just as much right.
let's all go.
Lydia's been invited to Brighton with the Forsters.
sea-bathing would set me up nicely.
I shall dine with the officers every night.
Papa, don't let her go.
Lydia will never be easy until she's exposed herself in some public place.
and we could never expect her to do it with so little inconvenience.
if you do not check her, she'll be fixed as the silliest flirt who ever made her family ridiculous.
and Kitty will follow, as always.
Lizzie, we shall have no peace until she goes.
is that really all you care about?
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.
he will keep her out of any real mischief.
and she's too poor to be an object of prey to anyone.
it's dangerous.
I am certain the officers will find women better worth their while.
let us hope, in fact, that her stay in Brighton will teach her her own insignificance.
at any rate, she can hardly grow any worse.
if she does, we'd be obliged to lock her up for the rest of her life.
Lizzie, you're welcome to accompany us.
the Peak District is not Brighton.
officers are thin on the ground which may influence your decision.
come to the Peak District with us, Lizzie, and get some fresh air.
the glories of nature. What are men compared to rocks and mountains?
men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity.
if they are amiable, they have no minds of their own.
take care, my love. That savours strongly of bitterness.
I saw Mr Darcy when I was at Rosings.
why did you not tell me?
did he mention Mr Bingley?
no.
no, he did not.
Oh, what are men compared to rocks and mountains?
or carriages that work?
where exactly are we?
quite close to Pemberley.
mr Darcy's home? - That's the fellow.
very well-stocked lake. I've a hankering to see it.
Oh, no, let's not.
well, he's so...
I'd rather not, he's so... he's so...
so what? - So rich.
by heavens, Lizzie, what a snob you are!
objecting to Mr Darcy because of his wealth. The poor man can't help it.
he won't be there anyway. These great men are never at home.
keep up.
is your master much at home? - Not as much as I would wish.
he dearly loves it here.
if he should marry, you might see more of him.
he's a lot like his father.
when my husband was ill, Mr Darcy couldn't do enough.
he just organised the servants for me.
this is he, Mr Darcy.
a handsome face.
Lizzie, is it a true likeness?
does the young lady know Mr Darcy?
only a little.
do you not think him a handsome man, miss?
Yes.
Yes, I dare say he is.
this is his sister, Miss Georgiana.
she sings and plays all day long.
is she at home?
miss Elizabeth.
I thought you were in London. - No.
no, I'm not.
no.
we would not have come... - I came back a day early...
I'm with my aunt and uncle.
and are you having a pleasant trip?
very pleasant.
tomorrow we go to Matlock. - Tomorrow?
are you staying at Lambton? - Yes, at the Rose and Crown.
Yes.
I'm so sorry to intrude.
they said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea.
may I see you back to the village? - No.
I'm very fond of walking. - Yes.
Yes, I know.
goodbye, Mr Darcy.
this way, sir.
are you sure you wouldn't like to join us?
we've just met Mr Darcy. You didn't tell us that you'd seen him.
he's asked us to dine with him tomorrow. He was very civil, was he not?
very civil. - Not at all how you'd painted him.
to dine with him?
there's something pleasant about his mouth when he speaks.
you don't mind delaying our journey another day?
he particularly wants you to meet his sister.
his sister.
miss Elizabeth!
my sister, Miss Georgiana.
my brother has told me so much about you, - I feel as if we are friends already. - Thank you.
what a beautiful pianoforte. - My brother gave it to me.
he shouldn't have. - I should have.
very well then. - Easily persuaded, is she not?
he once had to put up with my playing.
he says you play so well. - Then he has perjured himself.
I said "quite well." - "Quite well" is not "very well."
I'm satisfied.
mr Gardiner, are you fond of fishing? - Very much.
would you accompany me to the lake this afternoon?
its occupants have been left in peace too long.
I would be delighted. - Do you play duets, Miss Elizabeth?
only when forced. - Brother, you must force her.
splendid fishing, good company. What a capital fellow.
thank you so much, Mr Darcy.
a letter for you, madam.
Oh, it's from Jane.
it is the most dreadful news.
Lydia has run away...
...with Mr Wickham.
they are gone to Lord knows where.
she has no money, no connections. I fear she is lost forever.
this is my fault.
if only I had exposed Wickham when I should.
no, this is my fault.
I might have prevented all this by being open with my sisters.
has anything been done to recover her?
my father has gone to London, but I know nothing can be done.
we have not the smallest hope.
would I could help you.
sir, I think it is too late.
this is grave indeed. I will leave you. Goodbye.
we must go at once.
I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia before she ruins the family.
why did the Forsters let her out of their sight?
I always said they were unfit to take charge of her.
and now she is ruined. - You are all ruined.
who will take you now with a fallen sister?
poor Mr Bennet will now have to fight the perfidious Wickham and then be killed.
he hasn't found him yet, Mama.
mr Collins will turn us out before he is cold.
do not be so alarmed. Our uncle is in London helping in the search.
Lydia must know what this must be doing to my nerves.
such flutterings and spasms all over me!
my baby Lydia, my baby!
how could she do such a thing to her poor mama?
you can't do that! - Don't be such a baby - Kitty, give it to me. - Who's it for?
it's addressed to Papa.
it's in Uncle's writing.
Papa, there's a letter.
let me catch my breath. - It's in Uncle's writing.
he's found them. - Are they married?
I can't make out his script. - Give it to me.
are they married?
they will be if Father settles 100 pounds a year on her. That is his condition.
you will agree to this, Father? - Of course.
God knows how much your uncle must've laid on that wretched man.
what do you mean?
no man would marry Lydia under so slight a temptation as 100 pounds a year.
your uncle must've been very generous.
do you think it a large sum?
Wickham's a fool if he accepts less than 10, 000 pounds.
heaven forbid! - Father!
Lydia married and at 15 too!
ring the bell, Kitty.
I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas. Oh, to see her face.
tell the servants they will have a bowl of punch.
we should thank our uncle. - So he should help.
he's far richer than us and has no children. Daughter married!
is that really all you think about?
when you have five daughters, tell me what else will occupy your thoughts.
then perhaps you'll understand.
you don't know what he's like.
Lydia! - Oh, Mama!
we passed Sarah Sims in her carriage.
so I took off my glove so she might see the ring.
then I bowed and smiled like anything...
I'm sure she was not half as radiant as you, my dear.
you must all go to Brighton.
that is the place to get husbands. I hope you have half my good luck.
Lydia.
I want to hear every little detail, Lydia, dear.
I've been enlisted in a regiment in the North of England.
glad to hear it.
near Newcastle. We travel there next week.
can I come and stay with you? - That is out of the question.
monday morning came and I was in such a fuss.
I don't want to hear.
there was my aunt preaching away as if reading a sermon.
she was horrid unpleasant. - Can't you understand why?
but I didn't hear a word because I was thinking of my dear Wickham.
I longed to know if he'd be married in his bluecoat.
the North of England, I believe, boasts some spectacular scenery.
so I thought, who is to be our best man if he doesn't come back?
lucky, he did, or I would've had to ask Mr Darcy.
mr Darcy! - I forgot!
but I shouldn't have said a word. - Mr Darcy was at your wedding?
he was the one that discovered us.
he paid for the wedding, Wickham's commission, everything.
but he told me not to tell.
mr Darcy? - Stop it, Lizzie.
mr Darcy's not half as high and mighty as you sometimes.
Kitty, have you seen my ring?
write to me often, my dear.
married women never have much time for writing.
I dare say you won't.
when I married your father, there didn't seem to be enough hours in the day.
my sisters may write to me, for they'll have nothing else to do.
there's nothing so bad as parting with one's children.
one seems so forlorn without them.
goodbye. - Goodbye, Lydia. Goodbye, Mr Wickham.
Bye, Kitty. Bye, Papa.
I can't imagine what your father does with all that ink.
Mrs Bennet.
did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield.
Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch of pork. She expects him tomorrow.
tomorrow?
not that I care. Mr Bingley's nothing to us.
I'm sure I never want to see him again, no.
we shan't mention a word about it. Is it quite certain he's coming?
Yes, madam. I believe he's alone. His sister remains in town.
why he thinks we should be interested, I've no idea. Come along, girls.
we better go home at once and tell Mr Bennet.
the impudence of the man. I wonder he dare show his face.
it's all right, Lizzie.
I'm just glad he's alone because we shall see less of him.
not that I'm afraid of myself. But I dread other people's remarks.
Oh, I'm sorry.
he's here. He's here. He's at the door.
mr Bingley! - Mr Bingley?
Oh, my goodness! Everybody behave naturally.
and whatever you do, do not appear overbearing.
there's someone with him. Mr Whatsisname, the pompous one.
mr Darcy? The insolence of it. What does he think of, coming here?
keep still, Jane. Mary, put that away at once. Find some useful employment.
Oh, my Lord, I shall have a seizure, I'm sure I shall.
Kitty.
we can't have this here. - Mary, the ribbons, the ribbons.
Mary, sit down at once. Mary!
mr Darcy and Mr Bingley, ma'am.
how glad we are to see you, Mr Bingley.
there have been many changes since you went away.
miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters too.
you will have seen it in the papers, though it was not put in as it ought to have been.
very short. Nothing about her family.
Yes, I did hear of it. I offer my congratulations.
but it is very hard to have my Lydia taken away from me.
mr Wickham has been transferred to Newcastle, wherever that is.
will you stay long in the country?
just a few weeks. For the shooting.
when you've killed all your own birds,
I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please.
mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige and will save the best coveys for you.
excellent.
are you well, Mr Darcy? Quite well, thank you.
I hope the weather stays fine for your sport.
I return to town tomorrow. - So soon?
my Jane looks well, does she not?
she does indeed.
well, we must be going, I think.
Darcy. It's been very pleasant to see you all again.
miss Elizabeth. Miss Bennet.
you must come again.
last winter, you promised to have a family dinner with us.
I've not forgot, you see. At least three courses.
excuse me.
most extraordinary.
we were going to walk in and she was going to say, "Sit down.
so, I feel...
Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?
it's been...
miss Bennet. - Mr Bingley.
I'll just go in and I'll just say it.
Yes, exactly.
I'm glad that's over. Now we can meet as indifferent acquaintances.
Oh, yes.
you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.
you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.
I'm sorry he came with Mr Darcy. - on't say that.
why ever not?
Jane.
I've been so blind. - What do you mean?
look, it's him. He's back. He's come again.
I know this is all very untoward, but I would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Bennet.
alone.
everybody to the kitchen immediately.
except you, Jane, dear, of course.
Oh, Mr Bingley, it's so good to see you again so soon.
first, I must tell you I've been the most unmitigated and comprehensive ass.
Kitty, be quiet.
Yes.
a thousand times yes.
thank the Lord for that. I thought it would never happen.
I am confident they will do well together.
their tempers are much alike.
they will be cheated assiduously by their servants.
and be so generous with the rest, they will always exceed their income.
exceed their income? He has 5, 000 a year.
I knew she did not be so beautiful for nothing.
...must be free from all insincerity.
she only can address herself effectually to the feelings of others whose mind glows with the warmth of sensibility and whose arguments result from conviction.
she must feel the influence of those passions and emotions which she wishes to inspire...
can you die of happiness?
he was ignorant of my being in town in the spring.
how did he account for it? - He thought me indifferent.
unfathomable. - No doubt poisoned by his sister.
Bravo. That's the most unforgiving speech you've ever made.
Oh, Lizzie, if I could but see you so happy.
if there was such a man for you.
perhaps Mr Collins has a cousin.
what is that? - What?
maybe he's changed his mind.
coming!
Yes.
lady Catherine.
the rest of your offspring, I presume?
all but one. The youngest has been lately married, your Ladyship.
my eldest was proposed to only this afternoon.
you have a very small garden. - Could I offer you a cup of tea?
absolutely not. I need to speak to Miss Elizabeth Bennet alone.
as a matter of urgency.
you can be at no loss to understand why I am here.
I cannot account for this honour at all.
I warn you, I am not to be trifled with.
a most alarming report has reached me.
that you intend to be united with my nephew, Mr Darcy.
I know this to be a falsehood. Though not wishing to injure him by supposing it possible, I instantly set off to make my sentiments known.
if you believed it impossible, I wonder that you came so far.
to hear it contradicted.
your coming will be a confirmation if such a report exists.
if? You pretend to be ignorant of it?
has it not been industriously circulated by yourself?
I have never heard of it.
can you declare there is no foundation for it?
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship.
you may ask a question which I may choose not to answer.
has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?
your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.
mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?
if that is the case, you cannot suppose he would make an offer to me.
selfish girl. This union has been planned since their infancy.
do you think it can be prevented by a woman of inferior birth whose own sister's elopement resulted in a scandalously patched-up marriage only achieved at the expense of your uncle.
heaven and Earth! Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?
tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him?
I am not.
will you promise never to enter into such an engagement?
I will not and I certainly never shall.
you have insulted me in every possible way and can now have nothing further to say.
I must ask you to leave immediately.
Goodnight.
I have never been thus treated in my entire life!
what is going on? - Just a small misunderstanding.
for once in your life, leave me alone!
I couldn't sleep. - Nor I. My aunt...
Yes, she was here.
how can I ever make amends for such behaviour?
after what you've done for Lydia and, I suspect, for Jane, it is I who should be making amends.
you must know. Surely you must know it was all for you.
you are too generous to trifle with me.
you spoke with my aunt last night and it has taught me to hope as I'd scarcely allowed myself before.
if your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.
my affections and wishes have not changed.
but one word from you will silence me for ever.
if, however, your feelings have changed...
...I would have to tell you, you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I love...
I love... I love you.
I never wish to be parted from you from this day on.
well, then.
your hands are cold.
shut the door, please.
Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I thought you hated the man.
no, Papa. - He is rich, to be sure.
and you will have more fine carriages than Jane.
but will that make you happy?
have you no other objection than your belief in my indifference?
none at all.
we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow.
but this would be nothing if you liked him.
I do like him.
I love him.
he's not proud. I was wrong. I was entirely wrong about him.
you don't know him, Papa. If I told you what he was really like, what he's done...
what has he done?
but she doesn't like him. I thought she didn't like him.
so did l. So did we all.
we must have been wrong.
it won't be the first time, will it? - No, nor the last, I dare say.
good Lord.
I must pay him back. - No.
you mustn't tell anyone. He wouldn't want it.
we misjudged him, Papa. Me more than anyone. In every way.
not just in this matter.
I've been nonsensical.
but he's been a fool about Jane, about so many other things.
but then, so have I
you see, he and I are...
he and I are so similar.
we're both so stubborn.
Papa, l...
you really do love him, don't you?
very much.
I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you.
but it seems I am overruled.
so I heartily give my consent.
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie, to anyone less worthy.
thank you.
if any young men come for Mary or Kitty, for heaven's sake, send them in.
I'm quite at my leisure.
there's fresh coffee.
got some.
any luck?
no.
well, did you check my e-mail?
nothing.
how'd it make you feel?
what do you mean?
the strippers, the clubs, the sex, how'd it make you feel?
did you get...
you know?
did you?
some of it repulsed me...
but some of it...
some of it made me feel...
yes?
are you David Huxley?
Yes. Why?
detective Kovacs, Budapest Police.
do you know a man named Josef Klim?
sort of.
do you mind if I come in?
please, come in.
what do you mean, "sort of"?
we met him at a resort that we stayed at.
the Alhambra? - Yes.
detective, this is my fiancee. - Oh, Miss Harrington.
I have seen pictures of you in the papers, with your father.
detective, please have a seat.
it was you who made the reservation, yes?
Yes.
have either of you had contact with Mr. Klim...
since you stayed at the Alhambra?
no.
detective, what is this about?
Mr. Klim was found murdered yesterday.
Oh, my God.
is this your business card, Mr. Huxley?
Yes. Yes, it is.
a woman at the company that last employed Mr. Klim...
says you left it, inquiring about him.
Yes, that's correct.
Why?
he had an American friend...
that needed help.
what kind of help?
it had to do with a visa.
I told him that when I got back to the office...
that I'd have my secretary call, and she did...
and she found out that he was no longer employed at the baths.
three nights ago somebody broke into a room at the Alhambra.
there was some vandalism...
and, by coincidence, the same night...
the manager says a man stopped in the office...
and asked about Josef Klim...
an American man.
her description sounds a little bit like you, Mr. Huxley.
I assure you, it wasn't me.
we've only been there that one time.
I guess a lot of people look like a lot of people, yes?
well, in any case, it appears the vandalism...
involved in the removal of a camera that was hidden in a wall of the room.
I think Josef Klim...
was taping unsuspecting guests and making pornography.
are you saying he was doing that to us?
it was in the room you stayed in. I checked the reservation.
klim was in jail in Berlin for extortion.
he threatened to expose a man and woman he had taped...
if they didn't pay him.
so I've been putting two and two together...
and I come up with a theory.
and what's that?
maybe he tried his little trick on someone at the Alhambra, yes?
but this time, how do you say...
it backfired on him.
and you think they killed him?
in my business, you got many kind of cases.
some ones come with answers, some are only questions.
this one is difficult.
nothing seems as it is.
this is my cell phone and pager.
please, call me if anything come to your mind about Mr. Klim...
anything at all.
hurt your hand, did you?
I cut it chopping tomatoes.
I hate that.
well, thank you, again.
we just lied to the police.
did you want me to tell him the truth?
he thinks whoever was there killed that man.
Hello?
it's me. Time to go to RealDoll. Com.
talk to you later. - Okay.
who was it?
it was the guy from the sex shop.
What'd he want? - Told me to go to this website.
that's her.
they're here in Budapest.
just trying to make a few quid on the EU, so I don't want no trouble, understand?
we bring birds in, they model, we make the molds.
I couldn't give two fucks who they are.
pay them a couple notes, they're on their way.
we just want to talk to the people...
look, leave it out, mate. I don't want to know.
which one is she?
Nika.
they're all just rubber dollies to me, love. You point her out, eh?
is that her?
no.
how about that beauty?
no.
that's her.
Yeah. Bleeding pain in the ass, that one.
Toe-rag wanted paying well over the odds.
take it easy, boys, eh?
only reason I used her was 'cause Gabor brought her in.
Gabor? - Yeah, skin man. Snaps all our layouts.
wanted to get his end away with her somewhat rotten, so I tossed him a bone.
do you know where we could find this Gabor?
I could have a look-see, try and rustle up a number.
have a gander.
something tickles your fancy, I'll sort you out.
gabor wants me to ask if you work for police...
or have any affiliation with law enforcement?
no.
you look familiar to me.
have you ever done any print modeling?
no.
hardcore?
no.
I know you from somewhere.
here's the Americans, Gabor.
come join us. - You, too.
Jesus.
so why you looking for Risa? - We want to talk to her.
business? - In a way.
let me tell you something. That bitch is nothing but bad business.
well, have you seen her recently?
I haven't seen her in months, and I don't expect to.
she owes me money.
do you know where we can find her?
last I heard she was working for Gorman Bellec...
but you don't want to mess with him.
why not? - He runs Dekan...
for the Russian mafia.
what is that? - Dekan. Entertainment.
clubs, films.
you want to be in the fuck business? I can make you look really good.
thanks for the vote of confidence, but I don't think so.
if we wanted to talk to this Gorman Bellec, how do we go about doing that?
see Greta. She will tell you where to find him...
but I'll give you a piece of advice.
you don't exist unless you have something...
gorman Bellec needs.
what happened? - I couldn't get to see him.
one of his goons said he was auditioning women for his club.
well, did you ask him about Risa? - He didn't know her.
what if it all ended with Josef Klim's death?
we haven't got the original tapes.
we have to find Risa and make a deal.
well, then let me take a shot at Mr. Bellec.
you said he was auditioning dancers, so I'll audition.
what, you're out of your mind? You're not doing that.
it's not exactly at the top of my list of things I want to do at the moment...
but it might be the only way we can find Risa.
no. We'll think of something else.
what, David?
I'll be careful, I promise.
I'm going with you.
I told you, he's busy...
and we don't open for another two hours.
I'm here to audition. He's my manager.
there's another one. She's American.
okay.
down the back hall. First door on the left.
please don't insult my intelligence.
we already shipped you 30, 000 units. I haven't even seen a single forint, yet.
if I don't see some money...
or hear a damn good excuse by Friday, you know what, my friend?
I will set the dogs loose, you understand?
good.
what is your name?
Tish.
what are you?
husband? Boyfriend?
manager.
so, Tish...
what do you do?
you eat pussy, suck cock, take it in the ass? What is your specialty?
I thought you were auditioning dancers. - I am.
I also do fuck film, print work.
you ever do any of that? - We thought she'd start off dancing.
you are wasting my time.
please, I want to start somewhere, and people say you're the best.
what people?
this girl I know. Risa.
if you are talking about the Risa I think you are talking about...
you two can get your asses out of here right now...
and you tell her, if I ever see her again...
I kill her.
I want a job.
you won't be disappointed, I promise.
everybody want to be porn star.
okay.
let's see what you look like.
take off your clothes.
no, get it all off.
Tish.
it's okay.
you sure?
you have a fresh look.
I like that.
you sure you're up to this?
there's only one way to find out.
you seen her, that's enough.
your bitch here better let me touch her.
if she doesn't, I might start to think that you two are cops.
we're not.
like you said...
there is only one way to find out.
you want to play, you pay.
she wants a job first.
put your clothes on.
don't say it. I mean, don't say a word.
I'm not gonna let you dance in some strip club.
I am if it means we find her.
I can't believe that I let you take your clothes off in front of that piece of shit.
we are in big trouble here. We lied to the police.
I thought about what you said, and you're right.
this could destroy you.
I don't care about that, anymore.
Yes, you do.
so do I...
but this isn't about just us.
no matter what he says or does, I know my father loves me.
everything I've ever wanted in my life...
any trouble I've gotten into, he's been there to bail me out.
he is at the top of the list for a Supreme Court nomination and this could kill it.
I won't let that happen.
would there be anything else? - No, we're fine, thanks.
Where'd you all end up last night?
well, after being stood up by my sister...
I landed in a Turkish bath that proved to be quite exhilarating.
looks like it.
so, David, are we starting to depose on Monday?
actually, I'm running a little behind.
what's a little?
a day, maybe two.
you remember what I said... - I'm well aware of the time crunch.
lf the depositions don't get done... - I know, Richard. I know.
boys, boys, boys. My head's about to explode.
there's a call for you, Mr. Kraft. - Thanks.
excuse me.
the sunlight here is killing me. Let's go to the bar, David.
sorry, Perry. I got to get home.
thank you for lunch. - Our pleasure, always.
I'll call you this afternoon.
Bye.
so what's going on?
what do you mean?
I mean, you both look like death warmed over.
and there's something wrong, isn't there?
there's nothing wrong, Lynn.
are you and David having problems?
it's nothing major, just...
a wedding.
I mean, and the whole idea of marriage and... You know.
why don't you guys join us for dinner tonight?
I promise I'll make Richard lay off the business stuff.
we've already made other plans.
where are you going?
dancing.
are you sure you want to do this?
my other choice being?
it's 20, 000 forints.
she's starting work here today. - Good for her...
but it's still 20, 000 forints for you to watch.
you're not doing this.
so you showed up, did you?
I didn't exactly expect this.
you want a job or not?
you go with her.
Tish.
she'll be just fine, manager.
relax.
go get yourself a drink.
first time, huh?
you can tell?
you'll do fine. Just think money.
be nice to her. She's a new girl.
it's not as hard as it looks.
my name's Deedee. I'm from Brighton.
Tish. I'm from California.
Oh, God, I love it there!
I used to dance at the Star Strip in Beverly Hills. Do you know it?
no...
but I know a girl who might've worked here.
Risa. Do you know her? - Fucking crackhead!
not a friend of yours, I hope?
no. I hung out with her once.
once is all you can take.
you know her, too?
I hate her, me and every other bitch in this place.
then she does work here?
until Gorman told her not to show her ass around here anymore.
come on, new girl. I have something better for you.
why don't you let her start on the floor?
why don't you all get your asses out there and let me run my business?
where are we going?
you want to be in porn business? I am putting you in porn business.
streaming video. Live on the Internet.
the girls will get you through it. Just...
you know, do what comes naturally.
let's do something with that hair of yours.
what? - Your hair. I do something with it.
maybe put it up? What do you think?
look, this is my first time...
and I'm a little nervous.
I gotta pee. - It's down the hall.
okay.
there's no way in hell...
what are you doing? - Let's get out of here.
where do you think you're going? - She's leaving.
I wasn't talking to you.
this is a mistake. I mean, I thought I could do it, but I can't.
let's take a little walk. - Sounds great.
I was not talking to you, asshole.
David! Come on! Come on! David!
I put the fear of God in you, did I?
I was so close.
all of the girls, they knew who she was, but I couldn't go through with it.
I'm sorry, David, I couldn't do it and I just...
what is this? - Her address.
Where'd you get it? - From a naked lady.
I'll stay here. - All right.
Tish, come here.
David.
in here.
what if it has something to do with us?
why would someone be killing them because of us?
I'm so scared.
come here.
if they were doing the same thing to someone else...
and that someone else decided to put an end to it...
maybe it's over.
maybe we have nothing to worry about.
do you really believe that?
as far as we know...
the only two people who know about us or anything that happened...
are dead.
but there's the policeman.
I mean, he suspects something, and now the girl's dead. What if he puts it together?
he can't connect us.
the woman at the Alhambra, she ID'd you.
she ID'd someone that looked like me.
Hello?
the game is back on, but now the price is $1 million.
check your e-mail. See you soon.
how the hell are we gonna get $800, 000 by tonight?
when Lynn needed cash for her place here, she used her diplomatic immunity.
had it wired from our Swiss bank. It only took a few hours.
that'll draw attention.
it won't, trust me.
is it going to stop once we pay them?
David, what do you want to do?
that kind of money takes me out of it.
it's not about the money. What's mine is yours and yours is mine.
what do you want to do?
maybe it's time to get some help...
but if we do...
we can kiss everything goodbye.
got it.
just like that? - Just like that.
I don't see anyone.
they're probably inside...
watching us.
they could just take the money and kill us.
that's why you gotta stay in the car, in case something goes wrong.
I owe you everything.
everything I am, everything I'll ever be...
and if it takes me my entire life, I will pay you back.
and I just don't mean the money. I mean what you do for me...
what you make me.
without you I'm just a dreamer...
but with you...
there's not a thing in this world that I can't do.
no. No guns.
for you, in case something happens.
I've never fired a gun in my entire life.
flip off the safety, you point, and you pull the trigger.
but nothing's gonna happen if you just go in there...
and you give them the money, and you get out.
I will. - Swear it.
I swear.
I love you.
Oh, God.
they said no police!
you are in a lot of trouble, Miss Harrington. People are dead.
we had nothing to do with that!
I know, but if you want to see Mr. Huxley come out of there alive...
I recommend you let me handle this, yes?
Yes.
Oh, fuck.
you fucked up. We have David.
no, please don't hurt him!
he's a dead man. I said no police.
we didn't know. He must have followed us. We didn't know.
look, I'll do anything.
I will give you anything.
I want $5 million.
what?
the price for the tapes is $1 million. The price for his life is $4 million.
that is a total of $5 million. If you go to the police, he's dead.
no, please.
we clean up the mess with the cop.
get out of there and no fucking around this time.
check your e-mail. Save his life.
transfer the agreed-upon funds into account number 2J4480...
grand Cayman Title and Trust.
the money will be immediately transferred to another closed account...
within 30 seconds of the initial wire.
upon verification, we will release David's location of bondage.
the slightest variation from these instructions and we will leave him to die.
money transfers are much safer, Miss Harrington.
I must say, I was quite concerned about your security last time.
I had no choice.
and you say this is a land investment?
in the Caribbean.
where, might I ask? - St. John's.
one of my favorite islands. Although Barbados has...
I'm sorry. How long do the money transfers take?
it's probably done by now.
great. Thank you. - My pleasure.
hello.
you can find him and the tapes at Elek Street, Number 10, in the basement.
I still would not alert the police.
there will be questions. It could get very nasty for you and your family.
do not dally. I'm not really sure how much air he has left.
damn it.
come on, God damn it.
yeah?
there's no Alex or Alec Street, but there is one called Elek, spelled E-L-E-K.
okay. How do I get there?
take the Freedom Bridge onto the Buda side.
it's right past the Gellert Hotel, right around Freedom Square.
I got it.
Oh, God!
what's up, Sister?
where are you?
taking in the sights with a friend.
where?
easy. Since you're in no hurry to take care of wedding business...
I decided to do some sightseeing.
fuck!
Hello? - Where the hell are you?
I just had brunch at the Women's Club. Where are you?
I need some help! - What?
I need some fucking help, Lynn!
Lynn!
I can't hear you. You're breaking up.
Lynn!
do you know where Elek Street is?
Elek Street? Where is...
Elek? - Yes! Yes! Yes!
of course. Are you okay?
is this 10? - 10?
number 10! - 10, yes.
Elek Street! - Yes.
you have a basement? - A basement. Yes, why?
Where's your fucking basement?
there is nothing down there. No one has used it for years.
there's a man down here. - No, there's no man.
he's dying! Please. - What?
David!
what do you mean a man is dying here?
David!
you better get out of here or...
how can this be?
I do not know how this has happened.
I swear to God. I will call the police.
No! No police.
how do I take this off?
breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
look at me. Look at me.
when are you and David going on a honeymoon?
in the spring, when the new Ambassador and her staff...
take over for Daddy and the others.
are you still up for shopping tomorrow?
Absolutely. I plan on doing heavy damage all day.
that's my girls.
may I have your attention, please? I would like to propose a toast.
to Christmas, good friends, the New Year...
and to David and Richard...
and a job well done.
hear, hear.
quiet, please! Quiet.
and to the next United States Supreme Court Justice.
and maybe a new congressman.
well, stranger things have happened.
here's to you, David, my new son-in-law...
to your continued success.
I can't believe the way you two spend money.
give it a rest. You're starting to sound like Mother.
or David.
so how is married life?
so far so good. Speak of the devil.
Hey, David.
Hey, you. You're gonna kill me, but I can't meet you for drinks.
but I've been missing you all day.
I've got to finish up here, okay? I'll talk to you later.
okay.
Hey, I love you.
enough. He can't meet us for drinks. He has to work late.
me, either. I promised I'd meet Fabian for dinner.
who? - Fabian, yes.
Fabian? - Fabian. Don't start.
I'm going to see you both Christmas Eve.
do you want to join Richard and me for dinner?
I'm gonna wait for David. Guess it means I gotta do more shopping.
I'll see you on the Eve.
counselor! I've got him!
down! You come down!
down for good!
forgive this early intrusion.
how are you?
I am a great admirer of yours. Honored to meet you.
may I?
can I use your typewriter, sir?
your arm, please. Relax it.
so, what are you cooking up?
another film without hope?
first time taking the cure? - Yes.
take a deep breath.
come in.
I'm sorry. I'll come back later. - No, do come in.
breathe in.
deeper.
good morning... May I smoke?
cough.
breathe in.
you've already read it? - Yes.
breathe.
and... what do you think?
well, I made some notes, but we'll talk later.
your system is a bit worn out. You may get dressed now.
nice looking girl. American, right?
you've got some fine merchandise there.
this treatment will do you good, you'll see.
nurse. 300 ml of holy water, 3 doses to be taken at 15 minute intervals, on an empty stomach.
mud bath every other day... - What time is it?
after the mud bath, ten minutes in the mineral water as prescribed...
I'll wait for you at the spring. - Yes, thank you.
sir!
sir, your glass.
0ver here.
you want to talk about the film? - Yes, of course.
fine. Just tell me if you'd like the producer to see my report.
frankly, I wouldn't want to be the one to cause you any trouble.
no, don't worry. I'm the one who called you in.
0n first reading it's evident that the film lacks a problematic, or a philosophical premise...
...making the film a series of gratuitous episodes, perhaps amusing for their ambiguous realism.
0ne wonders what the authors are trying to say...
are they trying to make us think? To scare us?
from the start, the action reveals a poverty of poetic inspiration.
forgive me, but this might be the definitive proof that cinema is 50 years behind all other arts.
the subject doesn't even have the merits of an 'avant garde' film, but it has all the shortcomings.
here, my notes. I doubt they will be helpful.
it's still a mystery that you'd think of me for a collaboration that, frankly, I don't think can work.
no, no. 0n the contrary. You'll be most helpful.
you see, the film... I really want to make this film.
I postponed the shoot for two weeks because...
Mezzabotta! Pardon me.
Mezzabotta! Mario! You're here too?
Guido!
what happened to you!
Hey, big Guido, how are you?
you've sprouted quite a few white hairs, old Snaporaz!
are you drinking that stuff? It's bad for you.
they said my liver is, well... And you, what's your treatment?
just a second... Gloria!
your daughter. She's all grown up. - No, she's not my daughter.
cruel bees, sucking all the life from these poor flowers.
darling, this is my friend... - I'm sorry. My shoes...
Gloria. Gloria Morin. - Nice to meet you.
fine, thank you.
I know all about you. Pupi always, always tells me.
we even had a big fight when I was very critical of your last film.
that's not true. You liked it a lot.
let's go for a drink. Let's go.
and you, are you here alone? And your wife?
well, I mean, better in general...
you heard about Tina and me? - Tina?
we're waiting for an annulment.
that's why we're here together. We're engaged.
Congratulations.
well, big Guido. What are you working on? Something good?
sure is the ideal place to do some thinking.
Daumier, the author, Miss... Pardon me, what is your name?
Gloria. - Gloria Morin.
nice to meet you. I am a big admirer of yours.
I'm flattered.
are you an actress? Did I see your photo somewhere?
an actress. Yes, well...
I have ambitions in that area. Actually enormous ambitions,
she's got a degree in philosophy.
allow me. Mario Mezzabotta. - Nice to meet you.
I don't have a degree. I'm doing my thesis. It's a bit different.
and the subject? - A difficult one.
the loneliness of modern man in contemporary theater.
interesting subject. Right, Professor?
and what is the meaning of the capricious apparitions of the girl of the spring?
an offer of purity? Of warmth to the protagonist?
of all your story's overabundant symbols, this is the worst...
she didn't make it. Better that way.
Yack! How are you? - Not too bad.
did anybody recognize you? - I don't think so.
you brought all that luggage?
it's just five suitcases. Gowns occupy so much space.
I brought one... you'll see. Did you get it all?
Carla, it's quiet here at night. There's nothing going on.
but it's a fashionable spa. There must be some fashion shows, some trendy clubs, even at our hotel.
have you been behaving? - Yes, yes.
actually... I couldn't get you a room in my hotel, and besides it's full of people who know me.
so, I found someplace else. A perfect hotel...
and how's this guy? - Sgulp? Great.
you look a little pale. How come?
see, the hotel is right here.
Signora, guests!
see. Like I told you. It's not...
but it's very quiet. If you're hungry,
I'll get them to bring a couple of sandwiches.
it feels a little sad here. - No, it's typical!
besides I'm hungry. You had lunch, but I didn't.
Hello, Sir.
how's the solitaire coming along?
rest assured. Signora will feel at home.
Yes, thank you. You wouldn't have anything ready for lunch?
the restroom, please? - It's over there.
I'll see to it personally.
trains, such horrible things. They leave your hands so black.
are you happy I'm here? - Yes.
really happy or a little happy? - Very happy.
hmm. Smack!
mm, what a nice smell!
Guido, I thought this black velvet was going to wrinkle.
Really? Good, good. - But no. Not a wrinkle.
even after a three-hour trip.
you didn't even tell me you like it. Do you like it?
such a beautiful lady!
so refined. That thing she has on her head...
what is it? Ploosh?
plush, plush. - Ah, ploosh.
I looked around for it like crazy. I was quite desperate.
but you know me. When Carla makes up her mind...
Snarp! - Sgulp!
I read a good Donald Duck last week...
there was a dinosaur...
guido be good. What do you want to do now?
are you sure you've been behaving? - Sure, why?
anyway, now sweet-buns is hungry. 0h, my wedding ring.
listen, Guido. That little thing you promised me...
what little thing?
now I bet she brings up her husband again.
you don't think so? You'll see, old Snaporaz.
my poor Luigi doesn't seem happy at all.
you see, my husband is not the confident type.
he gets depressed.
he's not stupid, you know. He's actually very clever...
it's so hot here!
he knows all of Roman history by heart.
he just needs a push.
he's still working at the fuel company, same salary.
Really?
be good and put down my purse. You'll break it.
I love that little purse. He gave it to me.
why don't you find him a job?
you know so many people. You've promised it so many times.
I even had a dream about it.
I dreamed that you did find him a job, but he'd lost his mind and killed us both.
who? - You and me!
know where we were?
in that little street, Via della Croce, where I bought you the same tie your wife did. Do you remember?
and I never knew if you were wearing hers or mine.
we were there on a cot, in each other's arms, naked.
and he came in and he killed us both with a broom!
draw the blinds more. - Yes.
that's it. Now go into the corridor for a minute, then pretend you've come to the wrong room and found a stranger.
0h, that's good. We've never done this one.
hold it there. Let me look at you.
no. No. Your make-up needs to be more, more...
more what? - More like a slut!
give me your eyeliner.
nice lampshade. - Yes, yes.
I'd like one for my place. - Don't move.
what is this hotel called?
the Railway Hotel.
I want to write to my husband so he'll send me an express letter right away. He writes such nice letters.
I'll let you read them. - Fine, but keep still...
make a slutty face.
go out in the corridor.
so, it's a part I have to play. - Yes.
who do you think I am? 0ne of your actresses?
you don't think I could be one of them?
I like staying home.
go on, get out. I'm sleeping now.
tell me. If I were really to do something like this, would you be jealous?
Why? Would you really?
who knows?
may I get you something? - No, I just came out on a whim.
would you like me to run you a bath? - No, I was just...
a glass of water, perhaps? - No, thank you.
what did she want? What did she say?
the owner, she wanted to give me a glass of water.
come here. Come.
0Pen up the sheet.
Guido, do you love me a little? - Yes, yes.
is that you, Mama?
so many tears, my son, so many tears.
Papa, wait! Don't go.
listen Papa, I have so many questions.
I cannot answer them yet.
see the ceiling here? It's so low.
I would have liked it higher. It's ugly, my son, ugly.
I would have liked it different. Couldn't you take care of it?
you used to draw so well. I'd like...
0h, the Commendatore, he shouldn't have bothered.
hello. - Respects. He's got very little time.
Hi.
how is he doing, this son of mine?
careful. Don't let him move you.
he isn't doing well? How come?
it is so hard, realizing that one has made such huge mistakes.
but I...
mother prepared you a little something.
a little cheese and two peaches.
don't worry about me.
sure, this place gets a little lonely, but your mother comes every day.
she keeps me company, you know. And keeps everything in order.
a little decorum is always necessary.
and with your wife, Luisa... all fine?
Yes. Luisa...
you two together have been my joy. Goodbye, son...
what is this place? Do you like it here?
I haven't figured it out yet.
but it's going much better.
at first, you see, at first...
Guido! I do my best. What more can I do?
poor Guido, you must be tired. Shall we go home?
I'm Luisa, your wife. Don't you recognize me?
what are you thinking about?
hello. - Hello.
good afternoon.
Guido! In a few days, I'll get you an introduction so you can get all the advice you need.
nice mystical figure. Right?
I brought you the three old men.
0ne is a Russian, another is a retired general...
what old men?
the ones for the role of the Father.
cover me, Cesarino...
come here, buffoon.
how are you? So nice to see you, Super Tarzan!
I called you six times. - Yes, yes I know.
it's about Claudia's script. - So?
I thought about mailing it to you.
in fact, I've already mailed it. - Really?
you've still got your looks. Why don't you go back to acting?
I was up all night with an idea for the spaceship.
why don't we make the upper story...
conocchia, don't take my arm! I hate it! And wear a jacket!
now I need to wear a jacket to talk to you...
how are you? How was your trip?
good. It's been an hour...
what a blinding vision! Beautiful!
Really? - Yes.
you're always telling me I'm 'bellissima'
how was my screen test? - Great, or you wouldn't be here.
they told me I have to look motherly and eat a lot of pasta.
I should gain six pounds. Is this all?
you are the author. You should be telling me something.
what should this lady do? - What?
Agostini!
I don't want to bother you. The hotel is grand, the whisky, excellent. But I have three questions.
Yes, yes, later. What is it? Ah, yes, yes. Pardon me.
Agostini, we should...
I just didn't feel like talking to that guy.
Claudia is getting offers from all over the world.
do you have a script, a few pages, an idea?
does Claudia realize that this might be a great part?
perhaps the best she's ever played? I'll explain...
I'm telling you as a friend, you're gonna lose her.
you want to see the old men or not? - Are you crazy? We're ready...
what? - The old men.
where are they? - Here.
Signora Carla called. She doesn't want to stay in that hotel.
it's ugly. She's right. - What can I do? Bring her here?
I'll call the old men.
sorry, I wanted to introduce you to my little wife.
she writes too. She's a columnist for some ladies' magazines.
she's got a few questions for you.
my readers go crazy for romance.
could you tell me something about your love life?
here they are. Say hello to the Dottore.
step down. You too, General.
and you? - 64.
and you? - 68.
what? This one has one foot in the grave.
next time I'll get three corpses. You asked for a pathetic type...
this one makes you wanna cry the minute you see him.
Hello, Commendatore.
get up or you'll hurt yourself. How are you, little Guido?
we took a helicopter. This one screamed the whole way.
Where's the swimming pool?
we haven't even checked in. Shut up!
has the treatment helped? - Yes.
feeling better? Here. - What is it?
just a token.
you're always giving me presents. - It's just like mine.
it doesn't need winding.
a watch! A little watch, everyone!
so, are your ideas any clearer now? - Yes, I really think so.
I've seen her passport. She's 52 years old?
Ah, she's a little girl.
good evening, signora.
and who are you, darling?
Mr. Director, another little question...
he wants to know the relationship between Catholicism and Marxism.
thank you, I got it.
you want to know about my political affiliation.
as an honest man, and all of you Italians are, you should be able to answer me.
is Italy an essentially Catholic country?
Yes, it is!
you shut up and eat your ice-cream.
it's the estimate for the spaceship.
I need to talk to you later, face to face,
I'm at the end of my rope. This is a madhouse!
fine, we'll discuss it later. What was that about your cholesterol?
...only one great writer. The early Fitzgerald.
then his writing became an orgy of pragmatism or brutal realism.
what does Left or Right mean?
you're such an optimist to believe that in a world this confused and chaotic there are people so lucid as to belong exclusively to the Left or the Right.
the Americans have this new theory about cholesterol...
is your ice-cream good? - Very good.
what?
how many scenes? - Five.
0nly five.
maybe six, or even seven.
good evening.
Hi, Guido.
the Ambassador's got his eye on signora.
so?
I thought you'd want to know. - Good, now I know.
do you want me to ask her to dance? - Yes, ask her.
dear friends there's only one truth...
but I am so anxious to know, to understand my character.
I need to coexist with my character for a while before shooting...
the lady says she needs to know her character.
I need to get inside her skin, her ideas, or I'll fail.
hasn't the Maestro explained the part yet?
no. - I am sorry, dear lady.
I don't have such information. I'm only the producer.
and now three days of rest.
Thanks. And for Guido?
mario Mezzabotta, all 200 pounds of him.
shall we take a little walk?
I know... Naturally, you think I've lost it.
Yes.
I'm 30 years her senior. So what? - It's all right.
I may be the fool, the old imbecile, the one who foots the bill. So what?
could you create something important, beautiful and real on a commission?
for instance, if the Pope asked you?
Yes, yes. I'll think about it. Excuse me.
listen, I'm not deluding myself.
maybe she's only with me for the money.
actually, that's certainly it.
but I've never felt closer to anybody in my life.
just look at her. She's pretty, charming, intelligent.
she has it all. 0nly for the money?
it's clear. She cares for you.
I made up my mind rationally.
the poor thing has never even mentioned my wife, my family, never a reproach.
how did you meet her?
in London. She was in school with my daughter.
how many years have you been married?
many. 31.
and your wife...
my wife took it really badly. She hates her.
so spell it out. I am a fool!
there must be a shooting schedule. Dates.
0therwise we're off to Germany. We have other offers.
will you be leaving me in the dark 'til the end?
you look like a little snail.
what is a little snail? - Une petite escargot.
can you hear the voice of the springs?
the Romans used to call it 'Happy Waters.'
Maya, let's entertain these bores.
may I?
are you ready, Maya? What am I holding?
a velvet purse.
and inside? - A white handkerchief.
a red one.
no drugs, I hope. - No, it's aspirin.
a purse. - Is there any money in it?
2, 725 lire.
and this lady here. What is she thinking?
no dirty thoughts, I hope.
just think about something.
about what?
whatever you like. Are you thinking?
Yes.
I'd like to live another 100 years.
best of luck!
and what is in this pretty lady's head?
let me be.
may I think about someone?
Yes. Go ahead, Lady!
forget about it. I'm ashamed.
what about?
can I really think of a person?
don't you worry darling, no risk there.
would you like to leave? It's cold.
a little kiss and a big slap. Is that right?
ladies and gentlemen, you're thinking, 'What a trickster.'
well, sorry to disappoint you, but there's no trick.
and it isn't just a coincidence.
it's an exceptional example of magnetic fields and telepathy.
I transmit your thoughts to Mlle. Maya.
you! Do you believe you can hide your thoughts?
please, leave her alone. Don't insist.
thoughts are sacred.
see, it's all a game.
Maya, are you ready?
just a moment, could we know what you gentlemen are thinking?
you for instance.
what are you thinking?
what else? My director. My cross and my delight.
how are you? - Fine. And you?
it has been quite a while... years!
unfortunately yes, my dear.
just a moment. You're famous now.
cut it out. Just tell me what's your trick?
well, it's partly a trick, but part of it is real.
I don't know how, but it happens. - Can you transmit anything?
anything. Except for her to get lost.
do you want to try? - Yes. Wait.
I bet now, with you, it won't work.
I don't understand. I can't repeat...
Asa... nisi... masa? Is this right?
right? - Yes.
but what does it mean?
Guido, come here! Where are you?
don't be spoiled! What a wonder!
I don't want to take a bath, I don't want to...
come here... let me catch you?
he wants to be carried by his sweetheart, doesn't he, the strapping lad.
come here. Come here.
he never wants to take the wine bath, the naughty boy.
don't you know that if you do you'll grow into a strong man?
guido is scared! Guido is scared!
the Devil and damnation!
granny, granny!
the wood is all wet this year.
always on the prowl and only comes in for food.
shame on you! Go to bed.
last time I slammed the door in his face and left him outside for two days.
I could have married again and found a handsome man, rest assured, better than your grandfather.
what an idiot I am!
I thought that if I took another husband, my first husband, whether in heaven or hell, wouldn't have waited.
be quiet! Go to bed, children!
nanny, Claudio wet himself!
what are you doing? Go to sleep. You too, sleep.
little Guido, get under the covers. It's cold. Be still.
did you say your prayers?
aren't you a beautiful sticky bun? The most beautiful!
give me a kiss, too.
who do you love best? Me? Is that right?
you can't fool me.
I'm going to give you a spanking.
I can tell when you're pretending.
sleep tight, little creatures.
close your eyes.
Guido, don't close your eyes tonight!
it's the night the portrait's eyes move. You're not scared, are you?
you must be quiet!
uncle Agostino will look into the corner and find the treasure!
don't be afraid, Guido! We'll be rich!
do you remember the spell? Asa Nisi Masa... Asa Nisi Masa... sh!
sir, you got two or three calls from Rome. Your wife, I think.
fine. Get me the line.
Gino, get the gentleman the line. - All right.
this is for you. Good night, sir. - Good night.
Marcella, that call from Rome, quickly.
no, I'm not offended.
there's only one thing that offends me.
you know me. No.
I forgive him everything.
let's have a little chat.
sit beside me for a moment.
no, I'm going to bed. I'm very tired and waiting for a call.
would you like some?
no, thank you. I have such a headache.
give me your hands.
I have a healing fluid in my left hand.
I put it on my belly when it aches.
is it any better?
Yes, maybe.
why do you look at me that way?
0h, don't say I'm beautiful. You make it sound insulting.
what's with you?
I feel I made all the wrong decisions in my life and in my work.
tell me, why do you enjoy torturing me?
torturing you?
talk to me as you would to an old friend.
I need to feel close to my director.
my character was a woman marked by the injuries of time, yet still desirable...
play "Mystification." - I don't know it.
but yes...
what a character... this woman...
but...
in whom people find protection and love.
I am this character. I am like her in life and love.
that's why I'm so lonely.
and I have always forgiven everything in the man...
the men, I love.
sir, Rome on the line. - Thank you.
I am very sensual. Wicked, too!
Yes, yes, you're very close. I'll be right back.
Rome on the line. You may speak.
Hello, yes!
do you want Luisa? - Yes.
feeling guilty, you beast? This is Rossella.
Hi, Rossella. How are you? Luisa was looking for me.
where were you this time? Your rest cure? What an excuse...
here comes Luisa.
Guido, I called you twice. Where were you?
I know. I'm sorry.
I was up in the production office. We're working.
how are you?
not bad... And the treatment?
is it helping?
perhaps. But, you know, I can't really rest.
and you? What are you doing? Having fun?
the usual. I'm with Rossella, Tilde, Enrico. They were about to leave.
hardly. It's a terrible bore.
but for my work, it's better this way.
good night, Guido. - 'Night.
you've met no one you know? Are you always alone?
0f course.
Really?
Luisa, why don't you come visit?
just a short stay. It's easy to get here.
when are you going to start shooting, you bore?
I don't know. Let me talk to Luisa, please.
so, should I come? Do you want me to?
if you'd like to.
you could even bring a friend.
but would it make you happy?
0f course, or I wouldn't ask you.
sir, are you staying on? - No.
whenever it's good for you.
careful, I'll come.
darling, I wouldn't have asked.
I'd love it... So long, and good night.
Bye, Mr. Alienated. Good night.
night, Guido.
Monsieur Guido, my agent thought...
just a second, madam. I am going to step into the office so...
shit! - It's in my best interest.
tomorrow morning we'll discuss everything. All right?
beams for the central structure: 10, 000.
planks for steps: 260.
evening.
do you need something?
no, thanks. Go on with your work.
what a well-behaved production team.
Hi.
2, 350. Corrugated iron.
I called the pensione about the German, but she's gone.
you must find her. - She's in Paris with a circus.
Really?
what should I do?
what an honor, Dottore.
you've caught me with my pants down!
listen Guido. About the farm... there's that...
Ah, here. Where's this place?
it doesn't even have a note about the address, nothing!
it's in the Prince's estate.
who's in here? - My little nieces.
Eva and Dina.
evening.
C'mon. Let him take a look at you.
perhaps he'll give you a little part.
nice to meet you. - My pleasure.
where are you from?
Trieste. - Hurray for Italy!
you've got a nice set up here, don't you?
tell him about my cousin.
Guido. This one's cousin is six feet tall.
you should see her. She might be good for the movie.
this one... you she-devil...
it's true. She's tall like me standing on the bed.
see?
she's twice been voted Miss Nylon Stockings.
is Guido in there? I'm coming in.
sleep, Conocchia, sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.
may I ask you a question?
go ahead.
my friend here says... you can't make a love story.
shut up! - She's right.
should I wake you up in the morning, Guido?
no, thanks.
0ur commander will never catch us unprepared.
this production crew never sleeps!
such a splitting headache. What did I eat?
they're always horsing around, but they're good guys.
do you need anything, Guido? Is it a new idea?
do you have something to tell me?
no, thank you, no.
go back to bed. I don't need anything.
anything at all. - No, thank you. Good night.
good night my ass!
who can sleep here? How can I get any sleep?
conocchia, calm down.
allow me. I have been in this business for 30 years,
I've worked on movies you couldn't begin to imagine and I have never been afraid of anything!
what are you shouting for, you crazy old man!
there, you've said it now. 0ld.
finally you've spat it out. Conocchia is old.
what do you want? Get back inside.
you always keep me in the dark. I never know what to do.
I don't want to know what this movie is about.
you want to keep it a secret? Go ahead. - Please, go back to bed.
but if I'm to help you out, as I've always done, and you were so happy then, you must tell me something!
tell me: Get rid of the French woman...
this is how I want the spaceship... tell me: Go hang yourself, but do tell me something.
you've changed so much, Guido my friend.
what are you doing now? Crying? Aren't you ashamed?
I'll be leaving tomorrow. I'm quitting.
just be careful. You're not the man you used to be, either.
a crisis of inspiration?
and what if it weren't a passing one, my dear?
what if it's the final collapse of a filthy liar with no flair or talent? Sgulp!
let's say you are purity itself.
but what the hell does it mean to be really honest?
didn't you hear what the Falcaccio said?
it's time to set all the symbols aside, the echoing of purity, innocence, escape.
what is it you want then?
Yes, this could be it.
there's a museum in the town, and you, the guard's daughter, grew up surrounded by images of ancient beauty...
you're right.
I want to create order, I want to cleanse...
I want to create order, I want to cleanse...
Hello?
they're asking for you from the Railway Hotel.
fine. I'll take it.
Hello? Who's that? Hello?
Guido, I feel dreadful. The mineral water made me sick.
I have a temperature. Come. Come here, immediately.
at this time of night? I can't. I'll come tomorrow.
come.
the poor thing, if you only knew how she was asking for you.
here's the ice.
she's melting. She's got at least 104. - Yes, fine. Just go now.
should I bring the peas? - What peas?
when she was delirious she asked for peas. It's a good sign.
no, just forget about it.
if you need anything, let us know. - Yes, thanks.
Carla, is this the first time you've run such a high fever so suddenly?
no. It shoots up over nothing.
then it goes away. My husband is used to it.
it doesn't scare him
no, don't get up. Stay under the covers.
I'm so hot. I'm thirsty. - Wait, I'll give it to you. Here.
drink slowly or you'll get all bloated!
it's four o'clock in the afternoon.
listen, now we'll wait for the doctor and see what he has to say.
it wouldn't be a bad idea to send your husband a telegram.
we can't take full responsibility for this. Yes, he ought to know.
no, I don't want it to be over. If he comes, he'll take me away.
and I have bought so many nice little dresses.
why did you gorge on all that water?
that's for sick people. Are you sick?
you're always ready when there's something to gorge on.
what else should I do? You're always leaving me here alone.
I drafted my will two years ago.
anyway, it's not like you die sooner just because you make a will.
you see, I have a brother and a sister too, but I'd like the apartment to go to my husband.
it's mine, but how would the poor thing manage with out it...
even if he does get remarried?
Ah, these sheets!
listen, tell me the truth, the truth, you hear?
why do you stay with me?
what can I tell the Cardinal tomorrow?
Yes, I did read the little synopsis your producer sent us.
it's very interesting. From a factual point of view though, the meeting between the protagonist and a prince of the church could not happen during a mud treatment as you describe it. I'm sorry but it's absolutely not feasible.
a high prelate has his own private room.
true, but I was looking for an unconventional setting.
what do you mean?
the protagonist received a Catholic upbringing and...
good morning. - Monsignor, this is Guido Anselmi.
nice to meet you. You must be the director.
Yes.
is the subject of this film a religious one?
well, yes, in a manner of speaking.
as I was saying, the protagonist had a Catholic upbringing, like all of us, for that matter. So, he has certain complexes, certain needs he can no longer repress.
and a prince of the church appears to him like the depositary of a truth that he can no longer accept although it still fascinates him.
so, he seeks contact, some help, perhaps a flash of understanding.
saul in Damascus, right?
don't we all harbor such hopes?
I do realize the idea might sound a bit superficial, gothic if you want...
no, no, that's not it.
I don't believe cinema lends itself well to certain topics.
you mix sacred and profane love too casually.
isn't that so? - Maybe.
yours is a great responsibility.
you can either corrupt or educate thousands of souls.
his Eminence will listen to you all the same.
you can ask him some questions.
allow me to introduce you to the director.
please, do sit down.
please pardon the intrusion, Your Eminence. I wouldn't presume, and he insisted that I...
are you married? - Yes.
any children? - Yes. I mean, no.
how old are you? - 43.
do you hear this singing bird? - Pardon?
it's called Diomedeo.
the legend has it that when Diomedes died, all these little birds gathered and accompanied him to his grave singing a funeral lamentation.
hear? It sounds like wailing.
coming.
Saraghina, dance the Rumba.
here.
shame on you, shame on you...
it's a mortal sin, it's a mortal sin...
I don't believe it, it can't be true...
look at your mother, look at her!
mother. - Stop there.
0h God, I'm so ashamed, so ashamed and hurt!
but above all, during his whole life and in any place where he lived, the pious Luigi most abhorred any talk or dealing with women, whose presence he avoided in such a way that whoever saw him thought he had a natural dislike of them...
get down!
don't you know that Saraghina is the devil?
no, I didn't. I really did not.
so, what does it mean?
it's a character inspired by your childhood memories.
no connection with a real critical conscience.
no, if you really want to make a polemical piece about the Italian Catholic consciousness, you would need a much higher degree of culture as well as inexorable logic and clarity.
forgive me, but... your naivete is a serious failing.
your little memories, bathed in nostalgia, your inoffensive and fundamentally sentimental evocations are all the expressions of an accomplice...
"how?" said the parish priest, "With a communist?"
see? He didn't say: 'a man'.
catholic conscience?
just think what Suetonious was at the time of the Caesars!
no, your intention was to denounce, but you end up supporting it like an accomplice.
see? What confusion... what ambiguity!
dear Doctor, I'm very angry with you!
but you don't need me anymore.
that isn't true, absolutely not true.
127: Showers and mud treatments.
129: Massages.
131: Inhalations.
SUSAN: And that's thr nrws.
but before we sign off, we'd like to congratulate our very own Evan Baxter, who has just been elected Buffalo's representative to Congress.
and, now, we have a surprise for Evan.
no, you don't. We do.
Oh, no. I really didn't expect this.
here's a look back at his run for office.
what arr wr gonna do?
all: Changr thr world!
that's right!
all: Baxtrr! Baxtrr! Baxtrr!
Hi.
all: Baxtrr! Baxtrr!
that's right!
I feel like that old Indian in front of all the garbage.
so, for the last time, this is Evan Baxter for Eyewitness News. Good night.
GPS: Huntsville, Virginia. Prestige Crest, four miles.
what did we do before GPS?
nothing.
guys, Dad's very proud of his new car.
Hey, I am proud of my new car. Look, I'm a politician now.
I'm in the public eye, and as you know, when you are in the public eye, image is everything, isn't it?
EVAN: Here it is! Welcome to the good life.
Hey, guys, why the long faces? We're off on a new adventure!
it's just we're going to miss our friends.
you'll make new friends, better friends.
Yeah, richer friends.
do not mouth off to me, sir. I am the boss of you.
and let me tell you something, you guys are gonna love this place.
and you know what? I think there's something for our fishermen up there.
EVAN: Baxter family, this is what's called a scenic vista.
and I don't think the big man himself could do a better job. Pretty cool, huh?
Hey, Dad, an iguana can stay underwater for 28 minutes.
what's that?
and a shrimp's heart is in its head. Really?
okay, someone's had enough Animal Planet for one lifetime.
Yeah, let's head out! Come on. The best is yet to come!
EVAN: Gentlemen, I have saved the best for last.
look over to the right. That is your new home.
jordan: That's our house?
Uh-huh. JOAN: I don't remember it being this big in the brochure.
was it this big in the brochure?
EVAN: Pretty amazing, isn't it?
there they are!
is this curb appeal or what?
here we go!
honey, I think you're blocking my photo.
sorry.
all right, everybody! Say "escrow"!
all: Escrow!
RYAN: Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Go. Go. Go.
EVAN: Guys, easy.
this is our house?
Uh-huh.
man: Careful!
JOAN: Honey, be careful! EVAN: Watch it!
are you kidding me?
mom, can we go upstairs? JOAN: Yep.
and I get my own room, right? Yep.
Mr. Baxter, could you give us some direction on these kitchen cabinets?
sure.
okay, it's between your maple and your old-growth Brazilian cherry.
that is nice! Which is best?
well, if you're not sensitive to that "save the rainforest" stuff, you can't beat the Brazilian cherry.
it's 200, 300 years old.
three hundred years. Three hundred.
Wow. That is old.
and now you are going to hold my dishes.
that's right. You going with the cherry? Cheery cherry!
Yeah. Definitely. He's going with the cherry!
RYAN: Dad, look!
no, no, no!
Ryan, do not touch him, please!
Oh, no, no, no, no, get him away!
no. He might have lice, fleas, maggots or something.
you do not play with stray dogs because they are very....
no, no! Get away, get away! Go!
okay. Oh, no, no, no.
he's thirsty. No, no, no.
no, you don't! There we go.
well, Ryan, he's a stray.
if we give him water, he's just going to come back.
come on, Dad, why can't we keep him? I mean, we've got a new house.
okay, Ryan, this is why we can't keep him.
they are stinky. They are smelly. They get hair all over the place.
they get a little thing called the mange.
in a nutshell, he is disgusting. Case in point.
EVAN: Ladirs and grntlrmrn, this concludrs day onr of thr Baxters' new and exciting life.
I have to do the new house dance.
Wow! That dance?
Mmm-hmm. That's a good new house dance.
thank you.
you know, those boys were having so much fun tonight,
I thought I would never get them to bed.
and then Ryan did the cutest thing. He asked if we could all pray together.
Really? What did you pray about?
he met a dog. What do you think he prayed for?
just a walking petri dish, that dog.
and Jordan was very precise.
he prayed for good visibility, good weather on the hiking trip tomorrow.
the hiking trip? Oh, right. Yeah. The hiking trip. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
you wanna know what I prayed for?
Yeah. What did you pray for?
I prayed we would become closer as a family.
honey, you don't need to pray for that to happen. I will make that happen.
what would you pray for?
me? I don't know. Praying just....
honey, you're the one who said you wanted to change the world.
it's a pretty big job.
if it were me, I would take all the help I could get.
woman OVER TV: Former Buffalo News anchor, Evan Baxter, takes office tomorrow to make good on a lofty campaign promise.
what are we going to do?
all: Changr thr world!
woman OVER TV: Good luck, Congressman. Many have tried, many have failed.
Hrllo!
this is Regina Sparks reporting for....
Hello, there. Hi.
this is Evan Baxter.
just wanted to say thank you for everything.
thank you for the new car and for the house.
the house is great. I love it.
I mean, I picked it out, but you created matter and everything, so....
I just wanted to say that I think Joan makes a good point, and that I am now in a position of great power, and I know that with great power comes great responsibility.
so, God,
please help me change the world.
okay. That's it. I'm hanging up now.
God bless.... Well, you. Okay.
what? That's weird.
what?
I set the alarm for 7: 00.
I am successful. I am powerful. I am handsome.
I am happy, successful, powerful, handsome, happy.
all right, everyone, wish me luck. The Congressman has left the building.
all right, Baxter brood, I will see you later on this afternoon for the big hike. Yes?
EVAN: You psyched? Are you ready?
all: Yeah.
Bye. See you. Good luck, honey.
Bye, guys! See you later.
later, gator.
Oh, gosh.
Wow. Honey, did you order anything?
alpha and Omega Hardware"?
JOAN: Never heard of them.
me either.
what do we have?
what is this stuff?
must have the wrong address.
Yup. The wrong address.
woman: Congressman Baxter. Good morning. Good morning.
man 1: Good morning, Congressman Baxter. Hello.
man 2: Good morning, Congressman Baxter. Good morning.
Oh, this is so cool.
Yeah. This'll work.
there he is! The head honcho. The big kahuna.
Rita, I think I have to do the dance.
do the dance.
that's enough of the dance.
Oh, this is nice! This is really nice!
this is too nice. There's something crooked going on.
do you smell anthrax?
Congressman! Hey, Marty!
nice sound to that. I like it.
here they are!
all right.
you remember Sarah, Allen, Michael.
I don't think you know the new kid Eugene Tennanbaum. I found him at G. W.
sort of a walking search engine. Watch this. How many stars on the flag in 1818?
15
and Congressman Baxter's coffee habits?
he likes a morning latte with a cruller, a decaf espresso after lunch, served sans pastry of any kind.
very impressive. A little freaky, but I like this kid.
I love you.
hmm?
I mean, we should hang out socially. I just got a ping-pong table.
not going to happen.
go find out where his license plates are. Everybody else, back to your holes.
EUGENE: He was actually right.
I'm doing a background check on that kid.
Ta-da! This, my friend, is a power office, to remind you of the mission!
both: "Change the world!
okay, Evan, who do you know? What do you mean?
Oh, come on. Yesterday we're in the basement.
today, look at this place. It's like the Emerald City!
enjoy your office. Your neighbor, Congressman Long.
congressman Long did this? Did you say "neighbor"?
that's right. He lives in Prestige Crest, right up the street.
Evan, you got to tell me these things. Think of the publicity angle on this!
you and Congressman Long having a barbecue.
congressman Long eating your hot dog.
RITA: Hate to break up your little weenie roast.
congressman Long's assistant just dropped this off.
the Congressman would like for you to junior cosponsor this bill that he's introducing.
hold on. Congressman Long asked us to junior cosponsor his bill? What's the bill?
the Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act.
never heard of it. Gene, here, now. Rita, why didn't you tell me about this?
I just did.
you need to tell me about it before I need to know about it.
Marty, you are not the vice congressman. I am the legislative....
nobody voted for you. If Evan gets shot in the head, you do not automatically....
if Evan got shot in the head, you're the first suspect.
play nice. Play nice.
all right, Eugene, Congressman Long's bill. What is it?
HR7124, better known as CINPLAN.
the bill would open up fringe areas of the national parks for development.
long's been sitting on it for ages....
got it. Pause. Come on, Evan, this is huge.
you hitch your wagon to the right star, you could ride all the way down to Pennsylvania Avenue.
this is day one.
you got your name on a major piece of legislation!
Oh, and another thing, he wants you to read it today.
well, I can't do it today.
I promised my kids.... Eugene.
well, sir, there's a time clock on the bill.
if Congressman Long wants to pass it this quarter, he's going to have to introduce it to the committee immediately.
I'm personally going with whatever Congressman Baxter decides, because if I could be like one man, it'd be him.
either him or Kareem.
can I tase him?
it'd probably be you.
come on, Evan, this is it! This is why we came here!
it's world-changing time!
Hey, anybody home?
come on. We're in here!
Hey, guys.
dad, guess what? I got all your stuff packed up so that we can....
what's wrong?
we're not going, are we?
first things first. I have been asked to junior cosponsor a bill.
see? I told you. And you owe me five bucks.
whoa, whoa, guys.
Hey. Hey, we said we would have to make sacrifices, right?
Dylan: Yeah. Whatever. New house, same old dad.
Hey, I'm the one who has to read this thing!
Hey. Did you hear? Junior cosponsor of a bill.
okay, Ry, let's clean all this stuff up. Dad's got work to do.
no. It's 6: 14.
of course. Voodoo clock speaks again.
what the....
Hey! Hey! Hey! No. Okay.
whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! What's going on?
I got a delivery for Evan Baxter!
Yeah, that's not mine. I didn't order that!
I just deliver, guy, huh? You got a complaint, call the number!
No! Hey! Listen! We are 416, not 614!
you've got the wrong house! You can't leave that there!
listen! Listen!
that's going to leave a brown patch!
I am a U. S. Congressman!
dad, what are you doing? I'm watching this.
genesis 6: 14.
gen 6: 14.
Joan! Do we have a Bible anywhere?
genesis 6: 14.
make thee an ark of gopherwood....
gopherwood.
god: "Go-four-wood." Get it?
well, it's not really gopherwood. I just like the wordplay.
no, it's pine and maple.
it was clear-cut from this valley to make room for all those houses.
excuse me. Do I know you?
not as well as I'd like.
I see you got my housewarming gift.
that was you? You sent those?
what are they for? Hey! Hey.
genesis, chapter six, verse fourteen.
I want you to build an ark.
you want me to build an ark.
Yes.
so that's why the tools. And you are responsible for the wood?
all right. Well, let's just start over.
Hello, I am Evan....
Evan Baxter. Born June 15, 1962.
eight pounds, 11 ounces.
mother's Carroll Ann Parker. Father, Eugene Evan Baxter.
you have internet access. Very impressive. Do you also have cable?
you're a clean freak. You care much too much about your outward appearance.
your left nipple is a quarter inch higher than your right nipple.
and when you were a little boy, you were afraid of Gumby.
who are you?
I'm God.
you're God?
Yes. And I want you, Evan Baxter, to build an ark.
okay. You know what? This conversation is a little thing I like to call over!
but I got to get going, because, frankly, I have an ark to build.
busy, busy, busy, busy. Nice meeting you. Take care. Oh, and....
all right, see you later!
shake it off, Evan. It's over. The nutcase is gone.
I am successful, I'm powerful, I'm handsome, I'm happy.
successful, powerful, handsome, happy.
get it out, son. It's the beginning of wisdom.
how did you get in here? I'm calling the cops.
Oh, no. No need! Look! Look. There's one right there. Right there.
officer! Officer! Officer! Carjacker! Carjacker in the car! Carjacker in the car!
careful pulling out. Pedestrian in the crosswalk.
shake it off, shake it off! Shake it off, shake it off!
good morning, chief!
good morning, Rita.
you almost scared me to death! What's wrong with you?
nothing. Just sort of a weird ride in.
weird how?
it was just a weird ride in.
okay, well, thanks for clarifying.
here's your mail and your schedule. Okay.
and they finally fixed the phones. My new extension is 614.
614
Yeah. 614?
right.
you want me to write that down?
I'd rather you didn't.
MARTY: Good morning.
Hey, Long came through with that seat on the House Resource Committee.
also, the new Congressional plates just came in.
gene, plates, now. And Alex at the Buffalo office had her baby.
boy or girl? A little boy. And here he is.
just as cute as a button. Not bad for such an ugly woman. Weighed in at....
six pounds, 14 ounces.
how'd you know that?
lucky guess.
hot, hot, hot! Hot off the press! It's a joke. Here are your plates, sir.
MARTY: Those are rock-star plates, man. You can park anywhere.
you can't be sitting in a chair.
you've got a committee meeting in five minutes.
come on, BMIC, Big Man in Congress. Evan Baxter, the shark on the move.
man: House Resources Committee is now in order.
the Chair recognizes the congresswoman from Tennessee to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.
CONGRESSWOMAN: I pledge allegiance to the flag....
all: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic, for which it stands....
.... one nation, under me.... ALL: One nation, under God....
all: Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
how long do you want to do this, son? I've got all eternity.
Hey. You okay, young man?
what happened? You fainted.
dropped like a leaf during the Pledge of Allegiance.
Chuck Long, Resources Committee Chairman.
Oh. Oh. Congressman Long. Yes. Oh, I'm so sorry about....
forget it! Many a man's been humbled by his first day in Congress.
so, how'd you like that office?
Oh, it was great. Yes. Thank you, sir.
not bad for a freshman dorm room, huh?
I'm bringing you into my land use bill because you strike me as the type of guy who knows how to hit the ground running.
Yes, sir. I read the bill, and it's great. I just had a few questions.
Hey, I wrote the thing and I have a few questions.
we'll get to the questions later. So, you with us?
Yes, sir. I'm in. Wonderful!
I'll need you to put that into a letter of intent, as soon as you're feeling up to it, of course. You get yourself better.
enjoy that office.
thank you, sir.
he's exhausted from reading that bill. I got woozy from just carrying it.
Evan, sit down.
Evan, what happened to you?
you can't faint during the Pledge of Allegiance. It's un-American.
Oh, good. The doctor's here.
say "ah.
just go home, get some rest and start on that ark. You hear me?
Evan?
okay. "God warned Noah that a great flood was coming.
Noah built the ark with his wife and three sons.
the ark was 300 cubits long and 50 cubits high.
Oh, this is insane!
what's insane?
congressman Long's bill?
Yeah. The bill. That's what I was looking at. Oh, man, there's a lot of research to do.
you know, baby, you have every right to be freaked out.
freaked out. I'm not freaked out. Why would I be freaked out?
I'm freaking out. This house alone is a huge adjustment and you've got a new job, and new land act bill you're working on.
we're in a new town. I mean, that's a lot of new.
so, you think I'm just stressed?
Evan, honey, I've known you 20 years. I know you're stressed.
well, that's the sugar kicking in -Yes, it is.
thank you, hon.
eat your ice cream -I will. Thanks.
she's right. This is crazy. I'm just stressed and you are gone.
EVAN: Good morning, troops!
good morning -Good morning. How are you?
somebody's in a good mood -I am.
I thought about what you said and you are right.
I need to get my head on straight.
guess what? This weekend, we are going on that hiking trip.
right here! High five me! -ALL: Righteous!
righteous. We are going to have a righteous hiking trip!
Hey, Dad, look, two doves. That's supposed to be good luck.
well, today must be my lucky day.
Bye, guys! Bye -ALL: Bye.
good morning, kitties, keep moving. It's not your house.
Hey, when you're on my lawn, keep it in your butt!
Hey, thanks for sharing.
MARTY: You're right on time.
long just called. He's on his way with the powers that be. Who are they, Gene? Talk.
congressman Jim Dodd, head of Ways and Means.
but don't worry, sir, he's definitely not "way mean.
that's speculation. I don't know him personally....
that's too much, Gene. Who else?
congressman Richard Stamp, head of Commerce, and Bob Hughes is Transportation.
I have a draft of your support letter.
sounds like a plan. Are you all right?
I'm good.
you sure you're good? Okay.
good morning, chief. Good morning, Rita.
are you okay? I'm fine.
you don't look so good. That's what I said.
you're all jumpy. Are you on that Fen-Phen?
guys, I'm fine. I'll be inside.
no, no, no, no.
no. Okay. No, no. No. No, no. No.
no, no, no. Oh, my gosh!
guys! No, no! Get out! Get out! Oh, my hair!
gentlemen, welcome. What an honor to have you here.
I'm Marty Stringer. I'm Congressman Baxter's chief of staff.
this is Rita Daniels, his executive assistant.
RITA: Arr you rrady, sir?
just a minute. No, no, no, no. Dirty, dirty, dirty! Big one!
Baxter's only a freshman, sir, but I think you'll find he is locked and loaded.
good. Maybe this young stud can help me get these old mares on board.
Oh, you'll be impressed.
gentlemen, good to see you.
do you want to explain yourself, Congressman? What is going on?
Oh, these
are birds.
what are they doing here? How did they get in here?
well, that is an excellent question.
and my response to said question is, they are trained aviaries, sir.
let me make you see what I'm talking about.
I can make any sort of movement, and they will not get off!
do you have a point, Congressman?
Hey, guys, what's the point?
what's my point?
I'll tell you.
the point is that man needs to dominate creatures and, ultimately, man must dictate what happens in this country.
God bless America.
I couldn't agree more.
you have got to be kidding me.
CONGRESSMAN: No, of course not.
we lost a huge project last year because of the red-headed woodpecker.
those environmentalists got so up in arms over the potential disappearance of one stupid bird....
Yeah, birds are stupid sometimes.
.... we lost over $25 million in business.
I see where you're going with this, Congressman. Good work!
your little display has obviously hit a chord. Gentlemen.
from now on, let's keep the surprises to a maximum of, say, none. Understood?
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.
Evan, that was brilliant. Risky, but brilliant.
what the....
I'll tell you one thing, these birds had a nice big meal before they flew in here.
you want me to get my BB gun?
you know what I want you to do? I want you to open the door.
open the door?
just open the door!
close the door after I leave! Just do it!
okay.
one, two, three!
man, if I get the bird flu, he is paying for my medical bills!
sheep!
Oh, no.
Oh, gosh.
go, go, go! Get out!
okay. No.
no. No.
I'm not doing this. It's insane!
No!
enough already!
see, if you had an ark, you'd have a place to put them all.
why are you doing this? Why me?
it's not time yet. Go on. Go on.
Yeah, go on.
so how about it? Feel like living on the edge?
beautiful, isn't it? I remember creating this valley.
notice how the mountains line up east to west.
that's so there'd be lots of sunshine.
where are we?
don't recognize it, eh?
no.
this is where you live, son. This is Prestige Crest.
I wanted you to see the original design.
so, you're really him, aren't you?
you want more proof? I haven't done the pillar of salt thing in a while.
that's all right. I believe you. I just.... I don't understand why you chose me.
you want to change the world, son.
so do I.
what? Well, why an ark? I mean, that's like flood territory.
you wouldn't do that again. You wouldn't do that. Would you do that?
let's just say that whatever I do,
I do because I love you.
well, then you have to understand that this whole building-an-ark thing is really not part of my plans here.
I need to settle into my house. I need to make a good impression at work.
what?
your plans. That's just....
what are you talking....
we're talking about an ark, right? I mean, an ark?
an ark is huge! I don't even know where I would begin!
well, I hear that a lot.
people want to change the world, don't know how to begin.
you want to know how to change the world, son?
one act of random kindness at a time.
build the ark.
I'll tell you what. You build it, I'll fill it.
and if anybody asks, tell them a flood's coming.
Oh, and you might need this.
well, okay. Okay, so what do I do? I grab the wood and....
well, okay.
you know, that's just cruel.
do you see him?
I don't see him.
building an Ark the Old-Fashioned Way.
God is the creator of the Heavens and the Earth.
he lives in all things and has over six billion seven hundred million children.
JOAN: Honey? You okay? You need something?
no, nothing. Just dropped something.
okay. Okay.
Yeah.
there we go. Okay.
come on. I mean, a beard? A beard's so dirty.
gross!
JOAN: Packing, so it would really help me out if you would....
good morning.
Hey, hey, hey, good morning.
Wow.
what's with the scruff, mountain man?
Oh, well, you know, I figured it was a weekend, and I thought....
JOAN: What?
honey, did I miss something? How long have you been growing that?
I'll get the door!
Congratulations!
what are you talking about?
the lots. You bought the lots next door!
Hello!
Oh....
and pulling the down payment out of your home equity? Very gutsy move.
I didn't do that, did I?
you sure did. So what's your plan? What are you gonna do?
turn them for a quick profit? Build them out on spec?
who wants champagne? Hip, hip hooray!
you bought eight lots?
Yup. I was going to surprise you.
surprise, surprise, surprise." Gomer Pyle.
what are you doing? We can't afford that.
Hey, Mom. John Lennon, good to see you again.
good to see you.
and eight lots? What are you going to do with eight lots?
I don't know. Maybe I'll build a boat.
did you say "build a boat"?
it might be something fun for the family.
we could take the boat, go sailing on the lake.
it'd be great in case it floods or something.
what is going on with you?
you bought all those lots and you're talking about building a boat.
Yeah. And you grow this crazy beard!
is this, like, a midlife crisis?
it's not that bad!
it's not? No.
why do you think they call it a crisis?
Hey, keep it down, you guys! Okay?
Oh, my God.
honey?
Oh, my God.
honey?
I know this sounds crazy.
I really think I need to do this.
okay.
build your boat.
just don't take too long, okay?
because we didn't leave our lives in Buffalo so you could sail the S. S. Depression.
here we go.
gentlemen, I'm sure you're all wondering why I've assembled you here today.
an Argentine lake duck has a penis as long as its body.
wow, that's huge. He must be proud.
so, I have come up with a little construction project for us this weekend.
the whole weekend?
the whole weekend. Yes!
and maybe a couple weekends after that.
I can do this. Help!
how do I stand up with a piece of wood? Here we go.
Oh, man. Okay, that's good.
mother! Father! Sister! Brother! Wow!
EVAN: Keep it straight.
Hey, Dad, he's back!
Ryan, no, don't do....
leverage it up! Leverage. Okay.
just put some leverage. You got to put some body weight.
ready? One, two, three. Come on.
Oh, I'm an idiot.
nice to meet you, Mr. Congressman. Why do you have raw beef hands?
well, I'm building an ark.
I got a boo-boo! I got a boo-boo! I got a boo-boo!
you ever hear of Home Depot? Here we go! Here we go! Oh, yeah!
all right. So our little Marlboro Man moment didn't work out so well.
it's a disaster. I don't know how to build something like this.
that's easy. Just don't.
hello.
Yes, Marty. Your fearless leader is right here.
Hey, Marty, what's up?
Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you.
I might need security. Thank you.
can I help you?
Rita, it's me.
why do you sound like Evan Baxter, but look like a Bee Gee?
okay. All right.
okay, that's great. It's longer.
Oh, my God. It is you.
Evan, what happened?
did you fall in a mine shaft?
no.
did you just come out of a coma?
no.
were you attacked by a werewolf?
no, I wasn't.
well, if you were going for that rugged look, you overshot it.
you look like a bum in a suit.
you need Supercuts and a shave.
right! Yeah. But I can't. It doesn't work.
what do you mean, it doesn't work?
it doesn't work!
what? Are you shooting up Rogaine?
Rita, if Evan shows up.... I'm sorry, sir. I'll be with you in just one....
Evan? Take it in. Take it in.
okay, yeah, to answer any questions you may have,
I am going through adult puberty!
this is all temporary. Why did you bring me down here?
what was so important?
what is so important?
I've got a letter of intent here about Congressman Long's bill.
you remember that, don't you?
well, you haven't been here and now he wants you to sign this in person, Evan!
no, I can't do that. Nope, nope, nope. Not gonna happen.
no. You can't do that. Not looking like that. You have to go shave!
I can't shave, Marty. When I shave, it grows back out.
that happens when you shave! But then you shave again!
you have no idea.
Evan, what is going on?
I'm....
building something.
MARTY: You're building something?
well, I hope it's a barber shop.
guys, I can't let Long see me this way, okay?
you're gonna have to tell him I'm sick. Just cover for me. Just help me out!
come on, Evan, be reasonable. You got to get rid of that beard.
I need your face back. I need you back.
can you at least tell me what you're building?
I'm building a boat. You're building a boat?
look, you got to cover for me. I don't want anybody to see....
Congressman! There you are!
congressman Long, I, I, I, I....
stop stammering, son. We all play hooky from time to time.
I'm not gonna turn you in to the principal. Mostly because I am the principal.
very good.
what's with the veil? Did you get your new set of braces?
no, no. No. That's hilarious, though.
would you drop that thing, son? I can't understand a word you're saying.
it's a wife thing, sir.
just trying to spice up the love life.
she's a big Loggins and Messina fan.
keeping it fresh. Keeping it real.
would you excuse us for a moment?
the Congressman and I are going to have a little chat.
come on.
nice, isn't it? Politics is dog-eat-dog, but if you survive, they give you a bigger den. Have a seat.
so, tell me, Congressman, are you freaking out on me or what?
no, sir.
Oh, come on, son. I hand you your first cosponsorship of a bill, and when you finally show up you look like the fifth Beatle.
now, you expect me to believe everything is hunky dory?
well, sir, actually, things have been a little more dory.
of course they are. I get it. You know anything about animals, son?
the Argentine lake duck has a penis as long as its body.
although you probably already know that. Or have heard it. Not experienced it.
you ever heard of the Arctic white wolf?
no, sir.
top of the food chain.
it's fast, it's smart, can fend for itself, but it chooses not to.
it chooses to run with a pack.
and do you know why?
no.
the Arctic white wolf, Congressman, realizes that it is stronger as part of a group.
do you know what happens when one of these wolves decides to fend for itself?
the pack kills the Ioner for the greater good of the community.
Ouch, that hurts.
are you familiar with Jim Jenkins, the junior congressman from Tennessee?
when I met Congressman Jenkins, he was fresh off the turnip truck, but now he's sitting on his own committee.
congressman Jenkins, Congressman Whitehall, Congressman Freeman, they all have committee chairs because they all run with the pack.
now, you have to come to a decision.
are you gonna run with the pack or are you gonna Ione wolf it?
I am a pack man, sir.
I want your full support and nothing else.
Yes, sir.
those fish are on you like bait on a hook.
birds follow you.
fish follow you.
let's see if we can get some congressmen to follow you.
let's get this bill passed, shall we, Congressman?
Yes, sir.
Hey, fleabag, out of the way.
Hey, Dad, I think there are more animals than yesterday.
well, let's not keep our audience waiting, shall we?
up, up. Push it up. Push it. We got it. We got it. Oh, yeah, yeah.
come on. Just let it go, just let it go.
dad, we can do this, but we're gonna need some help.
I know. We just need something to lift those beams.
like that?
RYAN: Holy moly!
RYAN: This is so totally awesome!
jordan: This is perfect.
Dylan: Dad, there's a note.
ask and you shall receive -G
let me see that.
how does it work?
RYAN: Dad, this is really weird.
repeat after me, "We are hamsters!
both: We are hamsters!
leg power!
both: Leg power!
and it's in!
that's it.
Hey, who has opposable thumbs? Anybody?
you want to try this one? Make sure it's straight.
RYAN: This is awesome! Jordan: This is so cool.
EVAN: Here we go. RYAN: Oh, my God!
Yeah. Gotta do the dance. Come on, let's do the dance.
we're doing the dance. Jordan: Dylan, come on. Do the dance.
EVAN: Come on, do the dance. DYLAN: I'm not doing the dance.
don't scratch!
stop it. Come here.
EVAN: Insult to injury! My!
good boy.
okay, guys. A little bit more.
here we go. I got it. Keep it.... That's it!
beautiful!
EVAN: You guys all right?
boys: Yup.
G
well, I hope this isn't our last supper.
man ON TV: There's no sign of our heat wave breaking, so this dry, hot weather will continue.
god: Until Srptember 22, midday.
if the ark isn't finished by then, you will be.
is that when it's going to happen? September 22, midday?
man OVER TV: High temperatures tomorrow back into the 90s everywhere, right on through Tursday and thr nrxt srvrn days, no showrrs, no storms.
that would be a good day to have chicken. How about Mom's chicken? Huh?
hon, could we have some more chicken September 22, midday?
boys, will you excuse us, please? Your father and I need to have a little talk.
busted.
RYAN: Dad, you're busted.
Yeah, I know.
what are you doing?
do we have anything unleavened?
Yeah, we do, it's in the back, next to the frankincense and myrrh.
we have a fancy name for it in this century, it's called pita.
got it.
Evan, what is happening to you?
don't! No! Just put it down! Look at you.
the hair. Are you on something? Is it a mega-growth hormone? What?
Evan, talk to me.
I'm building an ark.
what does that mean?
God appeared to me and told me to build an ark.
he said there was going to be a flood and that I should be prepared.
whenever I shave, my beard grows right back out.
my hair grows longer every day. This robe.... God sent me the robe.
he thought it would be funny.
I actually think it's really comfortable. That's why I'm wearing it.
the beard, the robe.
you're Noah?
Yeah, kind of.
mom!
not now, Noah!
Dylan.
okay.
we left everything behind to come here.
maybe that's put too much pressure on you. I don't know.
but this has got to stop. Please. You're scaring me.
the boys need their father back, and I need my husband back.
Yes. Successful. Powerful. Handsome. Happy.
successful. Powerful. Handsome. Happy.
good morning!
cold today, huh?
hmm?
back to work"?
okay. All right. You want me to wear the robe? I'll wear the robe.
two can play this game.
ha, ha, ha!
the student has become the teacher.
this meeting will come to order.
Rita, any sign of him?
Marty, I told you, I will let you know as soon as....
you know what? You got me. He's here. We're in the middle of a yoga class.
Rita, this is no time for jokes. I'm not kidding.
if he's not in that meeting, we're all out of a job.
wait a minute. Let me finish my sun salutation.
Marty! Sorry I'm late. Come on, let's go.
what is that?
making lemonade out of lemons. Pick up your phone! Come on!
long: At its heart, this bill gives private citizens access to lands they technically already own.
CONGRESSPERSON: Will the Chairman yield?
Oh, look, there he is.
Yup, yup, I see him.
access is just a word you're using to hide what's really going on here.
this is about development, short and simple.
Evan, what are you doing? You have a pony tail on your face!
what you gonna do next? Cornrow your eyebrows?
development means the advancement of jobs, an increase in domestic commerce. If you happen to like those things,
I invite you to join myself and my cosponsors, Congressman Dodd,
congressman Hughes and Congressman Baxter.
did you just do a wardrobe change?
what do you think this is, the Oscars? You are not Whoopi.
long: Ladies and gentlemen! Please!
please! Congressman Baxter has a tendency to embrace the theatrical in his support of this bill. Congressman, let me warn you, you are approximately 10 seconds away from committee censure.
Oh, no. Hey, would anyone mind if I close the window?
long: Ladies and gentlemen! Please! These animals are trained!
I've seen this circus act before!
congressman, I'm sure St. Francis would be envious.
we, however, are not. You have five seconds.
you march yourself and your little animal troupe out of here now or you will be forcibly removed.
I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.
Congressman!
these animals are not trained.
Congressman!
I think they want me to save them!
save them from what, Congressman?
saving the animals, okay. I can roll with that. That's a good idea.
the flood.
a flood? Rolling out.
CONGRESSPERSON: The flood.
this has been the hottest, driest summer on record and you say we're going to have a flood?
when might we expect this?
september 22, midday.
that's what I was told.
might I ask who told you?
not in front of all those people. Don't say it. Don't say it.
God.
God? You talk to God?
Yes.
long: And God is talking back?
Yeah. We hung out a little.
well, time to update the resume.
congressman, your name is being removed from this bill.
obviously, the stresses of this office have proven too much for you.
please have the congressman removed.
no. Please! You don't understand!
God commanded me to build an ark!
it's going to rain! There's going to be a flood!
remove him now!
we have to prepare ourselves!
I need to finish the ark!
remove him now!
does this mean we're moving back home?
home, Canada. One or the other.
Joan? I know you probably saw what happened, but I can explain.
take the stuff to the car, guys. I'll be there in a minute.
guys?
I'm gonna take them to my mother's. Evan, I think you need help.
Joan, please. I'm not doing this. It's not me. It's him.
I went to that meeting in a suit, and he took it off of me.
those animals are following me because of him.
God? Does God know he's destroying our lives?
does God know he's going to get you fired?
Yeah! He's trying to get me fired!
he is trying to get me fired!
that way I'll have more time to work on the ark!
because the rain and the floods are coming.
no, I heard you, Evan. The whole world heard you.
Joan, please, you gotta believe me.
there it is! It's happening! It's happening! It's raining!
goodbye, Evan.
Joan!
I know! I know. Whatever you do, you do because you love me!
do me a favor. Love me less.
reporter: Congressman!
woman: Are you concerned at all about Congressman Baxter's tirade and the adverse effects it may have on your bill?
the day it rains and floods and Congressman Baxter takes a ride on his ark, that'll be the day I'll be concerned. Thank you.
his name is Evan Baxter, but now he goes by "New York's Noah,
heaven's Evan," "The Weirdo with a Beardo.
okay, guys. Watch it. Watch it. Coming through. Watch your back.
Marty, will you comment on Congressman Baxter's change of appearance?
Yes, his hair is long. Yes, his beard is unshaven.
are you equally stunned by this man's appearance?
the way things go around here, if he gets any crazier, we may end up in the White House.
Hey! No, no, no! That's my cup!
whatever.
he's filling the boat with two of every kind of animal.
still to be collected, two giraffes, two elephants and one more jackass.
what an idiot.
he's a mook.
jerks.
don't worry about it, you guys. Come on, eat up.
not hungry.
Yeah, me neither.
you guys can't eat. I can't stop.
can I go to the bathroom? Me, too?
okay. Dylan, go with them. Please?
fine.
excuse me. Can I get a refill, please?
coming right up.
thank you.
excuse me. Are you all right?
Yeah.
no. It's a long story.
well, I like stories.
I'm considered a bit of a storyteller myself.
my husband.... Have you heard of "New York's Noah"?
the guy who's building the ark.
that's him.
I love that story, Noah and the Ark.
you know, a lot of people miss the point of that story.
they think it's about God's wrath and anger.
they love it when God gets angry.
what is the story about, then? The ark?
well, I think it's a love story about believing in each other.
you know, the animals showed up in pairs. They stood by each other, side by side, just like Noah and his family. Everybody entered the ark side by side.
but my husband says God told him to do it.
what do you do with that?
sounds like an opportunity.
let me ask you something.
if someone prays for patience, you think God gives them patience?
or does he give them the opportunity to be patient?
if they pray for courage, does God give them courage, or does he give them opportunities to be courageous?
if someone prayed for their family to be closer, you think God zaps them with warm, fuzzy feelings?
or does he give them opportunities to love each other?
well, I got to run. A lot of people to serve. Enjoy.
Jon: Guess this comes as no surprise to those who remember his campaign promise, "I will lower taxes, "go crazy and build a gigantic ark.
JOAN: Oh, my gosh.
JOAN: Evan!
dad?
honey!
dad?
you guys, I'm up here.
rough week? Jordan: You look really funny.
you look really old.
Yeah, well, he is really old.
why'd you come back?
it was the kids.
tell him, guys.
we like you better as the crazy guy.
you spend time with us and you're home a lot more.
just, please don't make us do the dance anymore.
I don't know what's going on, or what you're going through, but we got into this as a family and we're gonna get out of it as a family, side by side.
but, Evan, we have to talk about the ark. It has to come down.
I can't do that.
you don't have a choice.
JOAN: Congressman Long went to the city. There's a laundry list of code violations.
you have until September 22 to take it down, or they'll take it down and arrest you.
september 22. That's the day of the flood.
mom! Dad! Come here!
don't you dare take that ark down.
how are we gonna do this?
there's no way the five of us can finish on time.
we don't have money to hire anybody else.
is that a Ilama with a hammer?
an alpaca. They rarely spit at people unless frightened or abused.
let's finish this sucker.
come on, let's go.
woman: No one knows where they came from or how the congrrssman is getting them to do it, but, two by two, animals of all kinds are working with Godspeed to build this ark.
thank you.
if this flood really does happen, "Evan help us.
Hey! A little help?
Thanks.
JOAN: Here it is, hon.
perfect. Thanks.
hold it right there.
this is Ed Carson coming to you live from New York Noah's construction site, where we are unable to leave the news van due to hazardous conditions outside.
high five. High five.
good job.
Hey, putty tat.
go, go, go! He tried to eat me!
Dylan! Jordan! Check it out! Your mom's building an ark!
let's do the dance.
JOAN: No, please, no.
woman 1: Well, where did the animals come from, then?
woman 2: Please. It's a trick.
woman 3: It's a circus is what it is.
wild animals running amok in suburban Virginia.
with all these species, what's being done about the feces?
Evan Baxter! You have gone from newsman to congressman to caveman.
what makes you so sure God chose you?
he chose all of us.
time to wash up, you guys.
Thanks.
you want some?
RITA: Why couldn't the man just buy a Corvette?
well, well, well. There they are. It is good to see you guys.
it's good to see you! Your hair looks great. It's very regal. Man, I love your hair!
and you're still sucking up.
so, why are you here?
long locked us out.
he can't do that.
I mean, I've been suspended, but I'm still a congressman.
Rita, tell him what you know.
tell me what?
I smelled a rat the second we got that office.
you don't get an office like that for nothing.
so I had the stalker here do some research.
okay, Eugene, talk.
prestige Crest used to be federal lands, but what's interesting is how it got into private hands.
congressman Long got the approval to build a dam and then passed out the surrounding lands to a group of private investors.
now, the locals fought this thing for years.
they said Long and his developer buddies were cutting corners, like skipping important building code checkpoints.
and with the land use bill, he's gonna do the same thing with the national parks.
so, you stand by and shake your pom-poms while Long and his buddies get rich.
what can we do? I'm suspended.
go back to the Hill and show them that you can and will fight this bill.
you guys, I'm sorry. I can't do that. I have to get back to the ark.
the ark? All right. Okay.
God told you to build an ark? Yes.
but did he tell you to make your friends believe in you and follow you here so you can make us look stupid? 'Cause I go to church every Sunday.
okay, every other Sunday.
I've been to church! And that does not sound like God to me.
Rita, I know that this doesn't make any sense.
I just want you to trust me. You just have to have faith.
if we're going to stop this thing, you need to get down to Capitol Hill now!
otherwise, it's impossible!
dad, Dad, I think it's done.
what in the world? I can't even get my cat to use the litter box.
it's September 22, and we're all still here.
awkward!
people! The flood is imminent!
board the ark! Save yourselves!
man: Get down, you fool!
listen to me! The time has come!
no, Captain Ahab! Your time has come!
Yeah, Baxter! The weather's 70 and sunny with a chance of crazy!
do you hear that? The rains are upon us!
dad, I don't think that's the rains.
man: Hey, Baxter! Kiss your ark goodbye!
where is he?
on the boat, sir.
give me a minute. Lets see if I can convince "Noah
that the world doesn't have to end today.
I gotta hand it to you, this is quite the show.
according to my source, the show hasn't even started yet.
still expecting the big flood.
you know, voters don't respond to the gloom and doom stuff.
they like a more positive message.
like the one you're sending with your bill?
how much did you make off of all this land?
you are destroying our national parks for profit.
you have a problem with somebody taking a little profit?
it's called business, son.
so if I need to get a message out there, or get a congressman elected there are people who pay for it, and yes, those people want this bill to happen and, by God, it's gonna happen. Now you look down there.
those are the wolves, son.
I'm gonna give you one last chance. Take down this boat.
I'm giving you one last chance. Repent.
such a shame. You had possibilities.
but you want to stop progress to save the Earth. Go for it.
good luck getting a tree to come to the polls.
take it down.
this is a court order approving the demolition of this boat!
evacuate immediately! You have there minutes!
honey. We have to go. They're going to destroy the boat.
no.
it can't end this way.
is it too much to ask for a little precipitation?
honey, maybe God didn't mean a literal flood.
maybe he meant a flood of knowledge or emotion or awareness.
if that's true,
I am going to be so pissed.
two minutrs!
GRT off thr boat now or you will br rrmovrd by forcr.
Evan, you did it. You built the ark.
that's all you were asked to do, right?
no.
there's something else. Something's going to happen. I can feel it.
Yeah, what's gonna happen is tear gas and a wrecking ball.
Evan, think of the kids.
onr minutr!
dad, whatever you say, I'm with you.
Yeah, me, too.
me, too. But can we keep some of the animals?
I like the alpaca. He spits.
you're right. We did it. We built the boat.
Yeah.
let's go. Let's go, guys. Come on.
EVAN: Well, I guess they don't want to go.
it's their instinct.
what do you mean, hon?
some animals know when weather's coming. When they feel it coming, they sit.
Joan!
okay. Timr's up! Wr'rr coming in!
get that ball in position! We're clearing them out!
is that rain? It's raining.
lucky guess, Baxter. Lucky guess.
looks like the drought's finally over. Good news, eh, Congressman?
Yeah. Good news.
everybody! Please! Get on the ark!
go to the car!
please! Everyone! On the ark!
cover me up! Keep me dry! Cover me up! Keep me dry!
who's crazy now, huh? Look at us all squishing!
it kind of stopped raining.
is that it?
what did I tell you? It's fine. It's over.
Hey, Ahab! This is it?
your God experiencing a little water shortage?
it would appear Evan Baxter was right about the rain, with a slight miscalculation as to the quantity.
something's wrong.
honey, the clouds are moving away.
no, no. No, this isn't right.
Evan, even if it kept raining, it's not like it could cause a flood in a day.
but today is the day! It has to be. This just doesn't make any sense!
wait a second.
what is it?
Marty said that Long cut corners, violated building codes.
what are you talking about?
the lake, Long Lake.
it's named after him. It's the lake! It's the lake!
Oh, no.
get on the ark! Everyone, on the ark now!
I think we should get on the ark.
I agree. I think we should get on the ark also.
I'm cold. I'm wet. I'm going home.
ladies first! Move!
Oh, my God. This is happening. This is really happening.
Holy.... Get everyone on the ark now!
get on the ark now! Let's go! Get on the ark! Let's go!
go, go, go! Get on the ark!
go, go, go! On the ark! Go, go, go!
all right, boys! Let's go! Let's go!
we're gonna need a bigger boat. Stay here with the kids.
come on, Rita!
everyone, up the ramp! Onto the deck! Come on! Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Dylan, get back inside! It's too dangerous.
no, Dad. I told you, I'm with you.
EVAN: Careful, everyone. In the ark! In the ark!
watch your step! Up the ramp, everybody!
guys, help me with the door!
get the door! Get the door!
guys! Guys!
everybody hang on!
you guys all right? You okay?
man O VER TV: There's been a flood at Prestige Crest and you're seeing live images of New York Noah's ark caught in the storm surge and heading towards Memorial Bridge!
woman: We're going to crash!
man: Turn this thing around!
man 2: We're not gonna make it!
man 3: Save us, Baxter!
I command thee halt! Stop! Whoa!
woman: It's not working!
how about a little help here?
what do you mean there was water damage? It rained for ten minutes.
that is not possible.
I love you guys. All right.
seriously. Okay, I got it.
I love you. Thank you.
long: All those in favor of the Public Land Act, please signify by saying, "Aye.
good God!
I think we can walk from here.
Hello, Congressman. Mind if I park my boat here for a little while?
but how....
the dam, Congressman.
your reservoir ruptured. Prestige Crest, it's all gone.
no. They said that couldn't happen.
I never thought this....
you. You did this to me. You set me up, you crazy son of a....
Wow. That is disgusting.
if that comes out your front,
I don't even want to know what's coming out the back.
don't look down, Congressman, but the wolves are here, although I wouldn't worry so much about these wolves as those.
man 1: As you can see behind me, New York Noah's prediction came true.
woman: Thr vote of the Land Act Bill has been suspended, pending investigation of Congressman Long for profiterring....
man 2: Of course now, the question is, how will these animals be returned to their natural habitats?
something tells me, if God got them here, he can probably get them home.
woman 2: The House will undoubtedly reinstatre Congrrssman Baxter when it reconvenes in the morning.
until then, there is a lot to be done here on Capitol Hill.
jordan: How's Buster doing?
EVAN: Come on, Buster.
JOAN: No, come on. Come on! RYAN: Come on!
EVAN: These too heavy? It's all right? Jordan: No, it's fine.
RYAN: He can't keep up.
I know, sweetie!
all right. What do you say we take a little break?
we've only been walking for, like, five minutes, Dad.
well, five on, five off. Life is about balance, right?
how about some sandwiches? Okay.
who wants sandwiches? Let's do it!
RYAN: I get first dibs!
everyone but Buster is going to get a sandwich.
you do not get a sandwich! You're a dog and you do not get a sandwich!
buster is part of the family now. You're just gonna have to get used to it.
poor Buster!
honey, come here. Sweetheart, be careful. Come here.
Hey, hon, save me one, okay? Okay.
I'll be right back.
Hey. Hey.
what are you doing here?
just hanging out with some old friends.
you knew all along, didn't you? You knew the dam was unstable.
if it hadn't been for the ark, my family, the neighbors....
I fought you every step of the way.
Yes, but you did it.
so, you had nothing to do with the flood? Like where the ark landed exactly?
I gave you a little shove at the end. Sue me.
you did good, son. You changed the world.
no, no, I didn't.
well, let's see.
spending time with your family, making them very happy.
gave that dog a home.
right. So?
so?
how do we change the world?
one act of random kindness at a time.
one act of random kindness -ARK
it's time.
do the dance.
care to join me?
I now issue a new commandment, "Thou shalt do the dance.
stop it! This is stupid!
that's awful dancing! You better stop!
man 2: We're wrapprd. We love you. Thank you.
back up! Back up!
and guess who the orphans have at bat!
that's right. It's the home-run queen herself.
the Belter from the Shelter. Miss
Amanda Lemmon!
what? -I'm going to kill you!
didn't I tell you not to play in that dress?
come on, Diane! I ain't going to hurt it.
it's time for your interview. Drop the bat. Let's go!
just let me smash this ball downtown, okay?
all right. You got 10 seconds.
otherwise, the game is going to be called on account of bloodshed!
come on, Frankie. I got to go to Staten Island.
Staten Island? What about camp?
you'll miss the bus!
I won't. It's just a look-see.
they're trying to place you with the Butkises?!
so what if they are?
you ever met those people? That family collects kids.
they'll take anybody.
even rejects like you.
shut up, Frankie! At least I got an interview.
and Amanda Butkis steps to the plate.
come on. Hop in. -It was a grand slam!
see if they want a little boy!
me and her. Two for one.
what am I, on sale?
get your own!
Staten Island, please.
you're out. We win!
Amanda didn't touch home plate!
you're a dead man, Frankie!
okay, so it's not Park Avenue.
you can't judge a book by the cover.
you don't want to be an orphan forever.
so adopt me, why don't you? -They won't let me, on my salary.
besides that, you deserve a mother and a father.
so get a husband!
it's not like buying a car, you know!
I know. It's got to be that " Can't eat, can't sleep reach for the stars. "World Series" kind of stuff, right?
a girl has her standards.
well, I got mine. And I say. let's blow off these people!
gum.
hat.
other gum.
look. I know these people have a stupid name...
...but they really like kids.
okay? So put on a smile.
sell it, girl!
why do I always got to wear a dress?
because it makes you look so pretty.
Oh, isn't she the most precious thing?
what a pretty little dress!
she's a honey! Look. She's got your mother's smile.
and your father's sense of humor.
that's very funny!
come on in!
come in, sweetie!
why, you'll love it in here! It's going to be fabulous.
callaway, huh?
must be a real big shot.
you'd be surprised how big.
all this for her?
welcome home, princess.
he forgot again, didn't he?
I'm afraid your father's been unavoidably detained.
if it's any consolation...
...I know an old butler who's mighty glad to see you.
I'm sorry, Vincenzo.
how terribly rude of me!
I'm very glad to see you too.
thank you, honey.
I see you've been practicing. Congratulations!
what's his excuse?
your father? Well...
...he's preparing for your arrival up at the summer house.
which one? -Lake Minocqua.
but that's been closed for years. He never goes there.
he does now.
Vincenzo, you big fat fibber! What's going on?
my lips are sealed.
you mean it's a surprise?
you could put it that way.
it's a welcome home party for me!
I knew Daddy was up to something.
Alyssa, I didn't say
I won't tell.
I've never had a surprise party in my whole life!
well, this'll certainly be a surprise.
come on, move it!
I got 43. -Me too. Guess who's missing?
Carmen, where's Amanda?
she's not coming.
Hey, slugger. What's up?
I'm not going to stupid camp.
I don't blame you. Look at this place. It's a pigsty!
it'll take you a week to make your bed.
don't joke. I'm serious.
I'm not joking.
that's why I sent the bus ahead without us.
liar.
how much you want to bet? -Fifty bucks.
okay. So I didn't send the bus. -Cough it up.
but I will.
then we can sit here until you tell me what's really wrong.
I'm not going to stupid Butkis' either.
I was waiting for that one.
if they're the best I can do. Frankie's right. I am a reject.
you're not a reject.
it's just that most people want to adopt...
babies.
I know.
this orphan stuff is like growing up in a dog pound.
everybody wants a puppy.
just once. I'd like to sleep in my own room.
Hey, come here a minute. Listen to me.
you listening to me?
I'm going to find you the best home in the entire world.
that's a promise.
you don't make promises, remember?
I didn't say I don't make promises. I don't make promises I can't keep.
there's a big difference.
now can we please go to camp?
please?
but you still owe me $50.
Oh, Vincenzo, it's gorgeous!
I think this house is going to be my favorite.
I remember many happy years here.
there she is. -Daddy!
come over here, my little
wait a minute!
you're not Alyssa. She's little. You're a foot taller than her.
it's me. Honest!
it is?
I've missed you. I'm sorry I wasn't at the airport.
that's okay. I knew it had to be something really important.
like a party, maybe?
she knows?
I didn't say a thing!
vincenzo didn't tell me. I figured it out on my own.
I should have let you surprise me. but I'm too excited.
you are?
it's still on, isn't it?
of course it's still on, sweetheart.
but are we talking about the same party?
Roger, she's darling!
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. Clarice Kensington.
Hello, Miss Kensington. How do you do?
what a perfect little girl!
Roger, I'm absolutely smitten!
you and I are going to be great friends.
are you here for my party?
your party?
Roger, don't tell me you haven't told her?
told me what?
sweetheart, the party is not for another couple of hours.
let's get you settled in, princess.
Yes, why don't you do that?
I'm sure you two have lots to talk about.
he didn't tell her. I can't believe he didn't tell her.
maybe he wanted to tell her in person.
I'm sorry. Did I say something to you?
remember to bring your own bag. Everybody off!
yo, Carmen, you blind?
what?
girl, when you going to get a life?
miss Kensington seems nice. Does she work with you?
not exactly.
I got something to show you.
right up here.
you see there? Across the lake?
that's Camp Callaway. That was your mom's favorite project.
so is she from the camp?
who?
miss Kensington.
sweetheart...
...I want to have a talk with you.
you know, Alyssa...
...a lot's happened while you were gone.
I haven't been able to come up to this house since Mom passed away.
but there comes a time when a person has to move on.
you're getting older.
there's just so much a father can do without help.
we have Vincenzo. He helps us. -Yes, he does.
he's been a good friend to this family for a long time.
but what I think our family needs is a
excuse me. Telephone. Board meeting.
let me call them back, okay? -It's urgent.
I'm with my
forgive me?
don't I always?
so good to have you home.
on two?
Hey, young lady!
summer vacation. Official. Go play!
will you come with me?
I wish I could, but I got a lot of work to do. Sorry.
