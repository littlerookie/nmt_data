it's a USB drive with a paper trail that proves I was innocent.
took me three years to dig it all up.
thanks to you, I had the time.
the appeals court won't even look at it.
I figured you might be able to help me.
it is the least you can do.
well, I'll see if I can get around to it.
I don't know if you've heard, but I am in the middle of a murder investigation.
don't believe a word he says.
we got motive. We got opportunity.
I know. Why'd he come back?
that's a good question, boss.
boss?
was your case, wasn't it?
Yeah.
you're not going back to Mexico, are you?
your case, you're lead.
Really? - Yeah. I think it's even a rule.
there.
all right, zooming in.
that's Renny Grant.
but he didn't check out of the hotel till three hours later.
so, where is he going? - Dinner.
or so he says.
what have we got?
our suspect. All over Rosewood's surveillance video.
but no sign yet of our victim.
keep looking. McGee... - What?
victim's background. Credit cards, bank statements.
Gibbs. Take a look at Renny's appeal.
use it to catch yourself up on the original embezzlement case, then work with McGee.
on it, boss.
are you going back to Mexico? - No.
rule number 38.
Yeah. Gibbs.
Yeah. On my way, Abs.
Caf-WOW! Right.
talk to me, Abs. Here you go.
thank you, Gibbs. - Abby...
I was just examining the evidence from the murder scene, Gibbs.
the room was luckily really clean, because, you know, hotel rooms, they can be a forensic scientist's biggest nightmare, Gibbs.
Abby! I'm not Gibbs.
Yes, you are. Because, if you're not, there's a problem.
and after Sister Rosita spraing her ankle in the sixth frame and Mr. Giggles escaping...
Mr. Giggles?
stay on topic, Gibbs.
not Gibbs.
okay, tell me. I can take it.
well, he's just upstairs... - Wait.
I can't.
rule 38.
so, um, I processed the evidence from the crime scene-- Tony
and nothing contradicts your initial assessment.
lieutenant Grady entered Renny's room. There was a short struggle.
broken lamp.
during the scuffle, they fell onto the bed.
bloody pillow.
where Lieutenant Grady was strangled and stabbed to death.
I found Grady's blood on the comforter.
I don't want to tell you what else I found.
Yeah, you do.
Oh, you know me so well.
but that's gonna have to wait for later, because I am cooking up some awesomeness.
awesome me.
I ran the swabs that you took from the sink, and I found traces of sodium tallowate, water and fragrance.
soap! Gibbs would have known that. - Right.
I can also tell by the chemical decomposition that the sink was usedafterGrady was murdered.
killer washed his hands.
and...
left a partial fingerprint.
it's degraded by the soap, so I can't run it through any databases, but I should be able to pull enough from it to incriminate a suspect.
well, we got one of those. Let me know as soon as you're done. Now...
who is Mr. Giggles?
back to work, DiNozzo.
I hope I don't have to train him all over again.
so Tony is in charge again.
Yes.
how do you feel about it?
Tony is a competent, capable investigator and a good leader.
you do not agree?
no, I agree. It's just...
he's kind of irritating when he'snotthe boss.
when he is, he walks around with that peacock strut, that smirk. It's like...
he's behind me, isn't he?
smirking.
that's good timing-- how long were you waiting back there?
two minutes.
Ziva, any luck with the surveillance video?
I finally found our victim, Lieutenant Grady.
he entered through a...
service entrance. - Yes.
nearly two hours before he was killed.
I spoke again to the floor maid, and she admits letting him into Renny's room.
claimed he lost his key?
McGee, stroke my plumage.
well, uh, nothing unusual in Lieutenant Grady's bank statements, but I did find a sealed file in his records.
well, some of his testimony in Renny's embezzlement case did involve classified information.
just to be sure, I'm petitioning the judge for access.
nice work, team.
I'm proud of you. We're sitting pretty.
pretty as a...
peacock?
Oh, hey, boss. Uh, Jethro.
did you catch up on Renny's embezzlement case?
Yes. And I went through his appeal.
let me guess: Wasted three years of his life.
no, you did.
kid was innocent.
the original case hinged on computer logs.
showed Renny embezzling from a base credit union.
first National.
using the latest open source forensic software,
Renny dug up evidence that those logs were falsified.
Yeah, but it turns out Renny wasn't even in the country when the money was stolen.
where?
iraq.
since the computer Renny supposedly did the embezzling with was on base...
I get it, McGee. The guy didn't do it.
he raises bunnies and grew rainbows, and I put him in prison.
come on. Think.
campfire.
huddle up.
thank you.
okay... Renny didn't steal the money.
that's my bad.
but it doesn't let him off the hook killing Lieutenant Grady.
not at all. It was Grady's testimony that put him away.
false testimony.
insult to injury.
so, if anything, Renny's motive for murder just got stronger.
what is our dead guy's motive?
lied on the witness stand three years ago. Why?
maybe he was the real embezzler.
used Renny as his fall guy.
sounds like a theory.
now we just need to prove it.
yes? - Jethro, come down a moment.
Oh, hey, Ducky. - - Tony?
Yeah, I'll be right down.
keep it.
Ziva, I want all the transcripts from Renny's embezzlement trial.
McGee, interviews.
if he worked with him, you're talking to him.
good campfire.
congratulations on your promotion, Anthony, fleeting as it may be.
Thanks, Ducky.
actually, I'm, uh, off to a rough start.
hope you got something good for me.
Yes, well, I found some anomalies on Lieutenant Grady's body.
first, note this pernicious rash on his lower extremities.
lovely.
it continues up his back, erupting into blisters.
some nasty blisters.
I have a sample for you to see, if you like.
I'll take your word for it.
agent Gibbs never passes up the opportunity of enjoying the fruits of my labor.
Yeah, his X-rays showed nodules on both his upper and lower lobes.
at first, I thought they might be cancerous lesions, but combined with the rash...
valley fever.
very good, Anthony. How did you know...
long story. Let's just say I'm not going back to Arizona anytime soon.
Yes. I feel the same way about Stronachlachar.
as you are no doubt aware, valley fever is native to the southwest of the United States.
the lieutenant must have spent some time there, and recently.
Thanks, Ducky.
that's not why I called you down here.
valley fever is aptly named.
lieutenant Grady would have had a slight fever when he died-- most assuredly
which would alter my initial time of death.
by how much?
two hours prior.
that would put time of death around 8: 30 p. m?
is that a problem?
Yeah, it is, because Renny Grant was having dinner at 8: 30 p. m. and I've got a dozen witnesses to prove it.
then your murder suspect is no longer a suspect.
give us a minute.
I am sorry.
just so I'm straight, what's that for?
putting me in prison or accusing me of murder?
prison. I think we're even on the murder thing.
you did drop a body down a trash chute.
good thing my probation's up.
what am I looking at anyway for tampering with a crime scene?
well, it's gonna be up to the judge.
if you're lucky, time served.
and my appeal?
I'll write you a letter.
better be a hell of a letter.
I promise it will be.
who set you up, Renny?
can you prove that it was Lieutenant Grady?
already proved I didn't do it.
and now you expect me to find the guy who did.
what exactly are you gonna do?
Renny. - Yeah, yeah. Don't leave town. I know the drill.
Tony. - You answered the wrong phone, didn't you?
what, McGee? - Wilkins is here.
well, just tell him you're handling the interviews.
well, he asked for you.
do I have to do everything? All right, I'll be right up.
told you so.
I've been waiting three years to say that.
how's life in the Pentagon, Mitch?
you pulled a Shawshank.
you put the wrong guy away.
we put the wrong guy away.
as I recall, you were his supervisor.
Hey, I just discovered the money was missing.
told you from the beginning Renny was framed.
he didn't have the computer skills...
he does now.
worked on his appeal in the can.
how's Ziva?
Why? - I haven't seen her in a while.
three years.
Yeah, right, of course. - Closer to two.
when she added me as a friend on Facebook.
Ziva's on Facebook?
you ever see her knife collection?
you've been to her place?
it was a double-team.
the embezzlement.
never could figure how it was done.
looks like Renny did.
access logs were faked.
and with our security systems, that's no easy task.
would have needed at least two people-- one to open the server port, the other to falsify the logs.
lieutenant Grady had a partner.
had to be someone in-house.
which rules Renny out... again.
it's a big list.
our department employs over 2, 000 people.
it is a lot of work, isn't it, Mitch?
I'm gonna need the updated addresses and contact info. Thanks.
you got it. Tell Ziva I'll poke her.
you know... Facebook.
what are you doing?
I'm waiting for you. You're late.
you got something?
I had something four minutes ago.
why didn't you call?
because that's not how it works.
when I find something, Gibbs immediately walks through the door.
have you forgotten all of your training?
I remembered your Caf-POW!
horseshoes and hand grenades, DiNozzo.
now that that's settled, I lifted our partial fingerprint from the soap dispenser.
it's still not enough to get a match from a database, but it is definitely enough to incriminate someone if we have a suspect...
suspect, I know. Got a list of 'em.
2, 000 of Renny's former coworkers.
check your inbox.
got it.
now, this time, if I find something, you better already know.
what's this?
for Sister Rosita's ankle.
I stopped by the NCIS gym.
it took me about four minutes.
and you found something.
we've got two embezzlers, and one of 'em gets trashed, literally.
Why?
maybe his partner got greedy, decided he wanted all the money.
but the theft was three years ago. What took him so long?
well...
maybe... - He got scared.
he found out his partner was going to meet with the agent from the original case.
it wasn't DiNozzo, but the killer didn't know that, so if I'm him,
I'm wondering why my buddy is meeting with a federal agent.
hmm, maybe he's going to flip on me.
he can't if he's dead.
there's our motive. We just need our killer.
may have just found him.
Abby matched a print from Renny's hotel room to one of his former coworkers, a Commander Carl Davis.
gear up.
what?
we've just never heard you say that much at one time.
or in a week.
wasn't my job before. Come on.
so, listen, boss, I just wanted to talk to you about this before we go in.
um, I was just thinking, 'cause I'm the boss on this case,
I thought maybe I should drive on the way back, you know, just for appearances' sake.
it's not that important, but... neverind.
here we go.
I'm the boss. Right. Federal agents.
yes? - NCIS. Is Commander Davis here?
well, he is gone for the week. I'm sorry.
look, I said he's not here.
we have a warrant. - Wait a minute, what are you doing?
McGee, around back. - You can't just go in there.
I said he's not here!
then we will not have a problem, will we? - Wait!
just calm down. Stay calm, ma'am. - What do you think... You have no right!
he's not here!
wait!
look, you guys have got this all wrong. H-He likes to be handcuffed.
and the broken nose?
he slipped.
and the lighter fluid?
look, after what he did, it was either that or my garden shears.
guess it was his lucky day then. Not yours.
the Burning Bed, 1984, Farrah Fawcett.
torched her husband while he was sleeping.
second wife's favorite movie.
maybe Commander Davis' wife is going for a sequel.
hell hath no fury.
like a woman scorned.
third wife's favorite quote. - Here, McGee.
commander Davis' wife received this in the mail yesterday.
postmarked from Hawaii.
over here.
photos of her husband on a beach, and he is not alone.
obviously not the missus.
who sent it?
paid a private investigator to follow my wife. Just thought you should know what he found.
the other husband-- how kind of him.
what do they say?
misery loves company.
Where'd you get that-- your fourth wife?
hold this against your jaw. - Give us a second.
I thought waking up to General Quarters was tough.
thank God you came when you did.
Yeah, would have been a bummer to find my prime suspect dead.
prime... - Suspect.
for what, cheating on my wife?
embezzling from the Navy.
you don't play much poker, do you?
murder of Lieutenant Justin Grady.
Jay's dead? When? How?
there you go.
now he's got his game face on.
look, I don't know what you're talking about.
Really?
you left your fingerprint at the crime scene last night.
the lieutenant was in Hawaii?
because I was, all last week.
and my wife has the pictures to prove it.
okay, I take full responsibility for making you think that Commander Davis was the killer.
that being said...
it's not my fault.
apology accepted. I think.
okay, exhibit A, from the murder scene, where I found Commander Davis' fingerprint.
except that Commander Davis was 5, 000 miles away at the time.
so how did his fingerprint get in Renny's hotel room?
I ran every test that I could on the dispenser and I found an interesting chemical compound on the exterior.
ammonia, arsenic, and hydrogen cyanide.
broken thumb.
C-Cigar?
Cigar-ette... smoke. - Ding!
except it was a non-smoking room and the smoke detector never went off.
where did the smoke come from?
I called the hotel to get another dispenser for comparison.
turns out this......
is the model they use in their hotel.
no one's ever seen... this before.
Where'd it come from?
Gibbs could have done that with just a look. You're such a pushover.
it came from here.
commander Davis' bathroom.
part... of a matching set.
someone stole it from Davis' house and planted it at the murder scene.
commander Davis was set up.
the soap dispenser was planted at the crime scene.
there was a third embezzler.
looks that way, my friend.
no, Tony, there was a third embezzler.
I'm looking at Commander Davis' computer logs.
he transferred the missing money to an internal account that he created.
then a third user moved it to an external one.
can we trace it?
I'm working on it, but I doubt it.
okay, pretend I'm Gibbs and try answering again.
I am working on it, but I doubt it, boss.
that's all I'm gonna get out of you, huh?
w-- I traced the account to the Caymans, but that's as far as I could get. I'm sorry.
okay, well, give me something to hold. I don't...
thank you.
whoever that third user is, he covered his tracks pretty well.
any chance it could be my doppel-friend?
Renny? No, that much I'm sure of, but given his research, you know, he may be able to provide a little insight.
we can find our own insight. - Yeah, but...
trust me, McGee, if we ask for a life vest, he's throwing an anchor.
any luck with Commander Davis?
Gibbs and Ziva have been interrogating him for over an hour and he's not talking.
so, if they can't get him to talk...
interrogation's that way.
I know!
you're late, Palmer.
sorry. Had to wait for Dr. Mallard to leave for his Pilates class.
Jamaican mocha.
I heard you were boss again; I stocked up.
Thanks. - Just in case.
all right, talk to me.
I got three guys who embezzled a cool mil from a Navy base.
and Renny Grant was their fall guy.
I did my homework.
first embezzler was found dead, second was framed for his murder.
so you think the third guy did it?
what do you need me for?
can't find him.
did you follow the money?
can't find that either.
not surprised. It's common for embezzlers to sit on the money for a year or two, at least until the heat wears off.
killer might finally be ready for a withdrawal.
and doesn't want to share.
What'd Renny say? - About?
the third embezzler.
Renny knows his case better than anybody.
you haven't talked to him.
trust me, if I ask for a life vest, he's throwing me an...
an anchor. Yeah.
yeah...I guess if I put an innocent man in prison, the last thing that I would want to do is go ask him for help.
but I'd do it, anyway.
Thanks, Palmer. Again.
that's "Agent" Palmer.
is there anybody here?
pot roast looks a little well done.
prime rib. Madeira.
fire department says it's been cooking for hours.
I guess we know Renny wasn't expecting company.
well, he got it anyway.
point of entry was from here.
there were security bars, but it appears Renny removed them.
guess I would, too, if I had just spent...
never mind.
window's been jimmied.
Yes, possibly with this.
I found it behind the bookshelf.
there is blood on it.
intruder must've dropped it in the struggle.
looks like Renny put up one hell of a fight.
well, only one thing seems to be missing.
third embezzler knows Renny might be able to I. D.him.
Yeah, well, he's tying up loose ends.
McGee, BOLO.
checked it four minutes ago. - Check it again.
Ziva, status on the traffic cams.
I will let you know when I get to my desk.
Gibbs, coordinate with highway patrol.
I want checkpoints at every on and off ramp.
Ziva. - No hits yet.
widen the search. The whole county. No, the whole state.
this a waste of resources!
just do it! Now!
DiNozzo. - What?
campfire.
problems? - No. Everything's peachy.
nothing I like more than putting an innocent man in prison.
except, of course, for getting him killed.
Renny's dead? I hadn't heard that.
save the pep talk. We both know I screwed up.
Yeah. Three years ago.
but now you're making it right.
and me proud.
you've been doing...
a hell of a job, Anthony.
until about three minutes ago.
get your head on right.
what would you like me to do?
trust your gut. - Yeah.
I think I'd rather trust yours right now.
then give me my damn phone back.
hope I'm not interrupting something
and if I am, I hope somebody's gonna tell me about it.
what do you got, Abs?
checking the roadblocks, boss.
so... I was interrupting something.
ABS, what do you got?
the knife from Renny's house.
I identified the blood on it; the good news is it's not Renny's.
the bad news?
you're such a cynic. There is no bad news. Only better news.
the blood belongs to...
our murder victim from the Rosewood Suites.
it's our missing murder weapon.
our messy murder weapon.
which is weird, 'cause most killers, they would rinse before they repeat.
why didn't ours? - Why don't you ask him.
he left his DNA on the handle.
NCIS handling parking tickets now?
Where's Renny? - How should I know?
you abducted him.
why would I do that?
you could almost hear the band playing in Tony's head.
he really does love this part.
Ah, he's earned it.
Larry, Moe and Curly.
the Three Stooges.
figured out how to embezzle a cool mil from the U. S.Navy.
but they needed a fall guy, didn't they?
and that was Renny.
Hey, I'm the one who told you I thought Renny was framed.
Yeah, it was a neat trick.
I'm going to have to rember that one for the next time I want someone to think I'm a complete moron.
betcha five bucks Tony does the chair-toss technique.
mm, ten he switches to strong and silent.
Nah, 20 bucks he's gonna do the picture tear.
you thought suitcase stuffed Curly was going to flip.
so you killed him.
I'm not sure what you've been smoking but, uh...
and then our friend Moe got framed for the murder.
and then you went after Renny, because you figured he was the only one who could still implicate you.
and with him dead, you guys were home free.
recognize this?
we got your DNA.
you should've stuck with embezzling, because you're going to get life for murder.
okay, look...
I did follow Lieutenant Grady to the Rosewood.
but it was just to talk him out of meeting with you.
and the part where you killed him?
he attacked me.
it was self-defense.
self-defense.
Where's Renny? - I don't know!
I don't even know where he lives!
you left the murder weapon at his house.
no, I left it at the Rosewood.
I don't know who took it to Renny's, but it sure as hell wasn't me.
I can prove it, too.
I was in court yesterday, all day.
court? - Court.
court?
metro busted Wilkins a week ago for drug possession.
arraignment was yesterday. Which means...
he didn't grab Renny.
wilkins isn't the only one with legal problems.
lieutenant Grady's sealed file just got unsealed.
if he wasn't lying in our morgue, he'd be under indictment for mail fraud.
Grady was put under investigation three weeks ago after the Navy received...
an anonymous tip.
Yeah, how did you know?
metro said Wilkins was busted after an anonymous tip, too.
it gets better.
Abby says the postmark on the envelope sent to Commander Davis' wife was fake.
photos weren't sent from Hawaii. - No. It was hand-delivered.
it was all Renny. He knew who framed him.
Yeah, getting his payback.
if Renny knew who set him up, why not turn 'em in?
he was buying time.
for what?
remember me?
found Sergeant Wilkins' knife?
Oh, yeah. Right where you left it. He's in custody. Looking at life.
wasn't part of the plan, but I'll take it.
they got what they deserved, no thanks to you.
what do you think you deserve?
three years of my life back, but that's not gonna happen.
thought I told you to stay in town, Ren.
those tampering charges are still pending.
that why you're here?
I think you know why I'm here.
you still haven't found the money?
I figured, you know, with all that research that you did, you might know where they hid it.
it'd be a hell of a consolation prize. - Yeah.
sorry. Wish I could help.
heading south? - I don't know.
am I?
how'd it go?
I guess I missed him.
Yeah. Well, I figured.
boat. Bourbon. Basement.
I get it.
there you go, boss.
are you happy?
you asked me to get you some ice cream.
did I tell you to blend it?
I didn't remember the blender being that loud before.
and this morning, you didn't remember that the dryer beeps on wrinkle guard.
it was a beep-- a single beep!
how can something with such little ears have such bionic hearing?
okay.
help me... please...
please help me.
must you do that now, Tony?
it's spring. I'm spring-cleaning, so... yes.
Spring-cleaning?
you don't have spring-cleaning in Israel?
we do not have spring. Israel is a desert .
I've been looking for this.
Ah, yeah.
I remember those days, when I was carefree and full of joy.
I envy you, Tony.
why are you dressed for a funeral, Abby?
everything okay? -- No.
Frank is sick.
who is Frank?
my mandibular second molar.
it's been killing me for a week. I'm finally going to the dentist.
you name your teeth?
you don't?
no.
see, that's the problem.
they're just teeth to you.
but evolutionarily speaking, your survival is directly proportionate to their health.
a cavity was a death sentence on the savannah.
Abby, everyone gets cavities.
no. No Sciuto has had a cavity since 1922.
good genes. - Genes?
I brush, and I floss, and I tongue-scrape more than most people would consider sane.
I have earned my perfect record.
no cavities, no surrender.
I don't deserve this.
I'll be back before lunch. -- Good luck.
don't get too comfortable. Dead body.
come on... you all know the drill.
he looks cold.
that's the least of his problems, McGee.
Hey, boss. Parents didn't have much to add.
baby's room was empty, except for the baby.
they kept hearing the voice through the baby monitor.
cops did a search of the area.
all they found was him.
they identified the body as Marine Private First Class Marco Riggs.
and I am identifying some pretty gnarly toes.
this guy needed a pedicure.
bothers you so much, DiNozzo, go find his shoes.
boss, I'm going to go find his shoes.
this would explain the voice the parents heard.
our dead guy had a military-issue cell scanner.
not exactly standard-issue for privates.
that's probably why he was misusing it.
take a look at the display, boss.
looks like Riggs was trying to use the cell scanner as a cell phone.
ended up broadcasting in a narrowband frequency.
got picked up by the baby monitor.
Yeah, I don't know about the feet, though.
that's because you don't know your history, McGee.
historically, going about unshod was considered by some to be an act of pious devotion, while others...
believed that direct contact with Mother Earth provided spiritual benefits.
however, in Roman and medieval times, going barefoot symbolized poverty, since leather and boots were too expensive for the average...
Really?
I-I... I wrote a paper on, uh... Never mind.
cyanosis indicates lack of oxygen.
no signs of strangulation or ligature marks.
did you write a paper on those, too?
time of death... two hours ago.
that a problem?
Mr. Palmer, help me with the body.
Yes, well, he's remarkably stiff for the recently deceased.
it's too soon for rigor, even at this temperature.
there's no...entry wounds, no sign of trauma, but something sucked the life out of him.
sucked the life out is right.
Abby is going to love this.
thank you! What a way to start the day.
maybe? -- FBI.
you need to come with us, Ms. Sciuto. Now.
where? - I'm not at liberty to say.
well, then, I'm not at liberty to go.
you misunderstand. It's not a request.
the deceased was Private First Class Marco Riggs.
recently assigned to CLB-3, Combat Logistical Battalion, supporting troops in Afghanistan.
until he was accused of stealing equipment, then selling it on the black market.
that include military-issue cell scanners?
it did, but Riggs disappeared before he could be formerly charged.
he's been listed UA since last week.
apartment was a dead end.
we have a BOLO out on his vehicle.
also waiting on the blood work from Abby.
well, we're going to have to wait a little bit longer.
Oh, don't tell me she needs a root canal.
no, Fornell just called.
Abby's been... requested.
requested? -- By...?
he didn't know. It just said the FBI has orders to transport her.
okay, I can access the FBI operations database.
I have a contact at the DOD.
bolo out on the FBI transport?
I don't know. I thought... maybe I'd just try to call her first.
Hey, Gibbs. Don't worry. No cavities. I was going to call.
Fornell already did. You okay?
Yep.
where are you?
in the back of a van. -- Abby...
I'm fine. It's exciting.
group of FBI agents swoops in and steals away an unsuspecting citizen to places unknown.
Yeah, it's the unknown part I don't care for.
Oh, I got Palmer's text about the vampire bite.
I can't believe I'm not going to be there for that.
who are you getting to fill in?
working on it.
well, if you need anything before then,
I keep a step-by-step Abby's Lab for Dummies in my desk.
it covers the basics.
a monkey could follow the instructions.
good. -- Oh, God...
cause we got one of those.
did you realize that the end was nigh, I wonder, or was it a blissful event as your ego and judgment melted away?
I mean, a stroke from... -- Doctor?
Yes, Mr. Palmer.
may I stop mopping now?
it depends. -- On?
has it enhanced your understanding of protocol?
consider me enhanced.
good -- then you may join me.
that invitation extend to me, too, Duck?
since when have you waited for an invitation? Don't answer that.
I know you like to keep people on their toes.
Mr. Palmer... -- Yes, Doctor.
protocol. -- What?
okay, yes. I will go not be in this room now.
what do you got?
well, sadly for Abby, not the walking dead.
a histological examination of these wounds reveal that they're burn marks, not punctures.
more consistent with a stun gun attack than a vampire bite.
a stun gun?
not normally a lethal weapon.
however, I believe the electrical shock aggravated an underlying arterial weakness in his brain, and that led to a hemorrhagic stroke.
after he regained consciousness, he would've been severely confused.
he could've wandered around for hours before taking refuge on that loading dock.
then he took his shoes off?
Yeah, well, it's called peripheral neuropathy.
it's common in this kind of stroke.
his feet would have felt as if they were burning up, but I doubt that he knew what he was doing.
towards the end, he would have been delirious, until eventually, his heart would have given out.
stun gun's a defensive weapon, Duck.
Yeah.
which suggests his death was unintentional.
Ooh, I found something under his fingernails.
it almost certainly came from the assailant during the assault.
I need to send it up to Abby's replacement.
well, that's going to be a long run, Ducky.
just spoke to the DOD, boss.
Abby's replacement doesn't arrive until Monday. - -Monday?
Monday. I made a lot of noise, but, you know, they gave me a lecture about budget cuts.
we did catch a break, though.
got a BOLO back from our dead guy's car.
want me to take Ziva, or...
no, I'll take Ziva.
you, uh... you take McGee.
take McGee where?
Abby's LAB FOR DUMMIES
now, why did I get picked for the cover art?
you want to sign, or should I?
I will.
I am the one with a biomedical engineering degree from Johns Hopkins.
among several other degrees.
maybe that's why you got picked for the cover art.
come in.
ma'am.
Yes.
from NCIS? -- Yep.
I, uh, asked you here...
asked me. That's a good one.
at the request of Dr. Phillip Heller.
he's in charge of a... rather special project.
is it a military project?
funded by the military, but Tarburst is an independent agency.
I'm not familiar with Dr. Heller's work.
no, but he is with yours.
he was quite impressed with your paper on Zinc Finger Nucleases in DNA Binding.
what kind of project are we talking about exactly?
uh, not the kind of project we can talk about.
it's why I was reluctant to allow your participation initially.
this is a highly classified matter.
so, what changed?
Dr. Heller is no longer with the program, and we-- your country-- need your help.
what do you need?
welcome to The Cave.
the Cave?
you should rename this place Nirvana.
Dr. Heller was given a sizable budget.
I can see that.
and almost complete autonomy.
all information was compartmentalized, strictly need-to-know.
only three other people, besides myself, even knew of the existence of this program.
knew?
two of the original team members died in a roadside bomb attack in Afghanistan.
which is why Dr. Heller's departure from the program has become quite a problem.
this was sold to the Senate Select Committee on a warning of a grave and gathering threat.
what exactly was Dr. Heller working on?
that's the problem. We don't know.
patients aren't allowed on this floor.
how did you get in here?
it's a hospital, isn't it? How do you think?
no, he hospital's upstairs. This is...
I know what this is, Sunshine.
I've escaped from P.O.W. camps with better security.
just exercising the lungs.
retired Marine.
sergeant Major Robert King, N. C.
not contagious. In case you were worried.
I was.
Where's Heller?
we got a game to finish.
Dr. Heller, he's, uh...
he's no longer with the project.
he isn't, huh? -- No.
well, doesn't that seem a little strange?
I mean, you know, considering.
considering what?
God gave you a body, I'll give him that.
skimped on the brain, though.
don't know how well you know the doctor, but if you knew Heller, - you'd know he wouldn't run off and leave all this. -- King?
she found me.
who? -- Nurse Dunstan.
makes Al Qaeda look like Jiminy Cricket.
I'm sorry.
he knows he's not supposed to come down here.
none of the patients are supposed to come down here.
I won't tell.
thank you. -- Let's go.
next time you get out of bed, I'm having you catheterized.
you wish.
nurse Dunstan --Your liaison with the hospital.
if you need anything, extension 405.
thank you.
and the lab rabbits should be here by 12: 00.
hopefully this batch lasts longer than the last. Quick march.
are you gonna help me, or are you gonna keep screwing around back there?
every single drawer in this lab is unlocked except this one.
you're not wondering what's inside?
I'm wondering where Palmer is with the rest of that DNA.
Oh, right here. Here you go. Thought I might be able to help you guys.
I do have lab experience.
and I have a biomedical engineering degree from Johns Hopkins.
he sure does love saying that.
Hey, will you put the screwdriver down, come in here, and hand me the ethidium bromide, please?
Oh, I got it.
I don't think that's right...
I don't think you're supposed to do that.
all right.
next step is to, mix the gel with the ethidium bromide.
I don't think you're supposed to do that.
I think you're supposed to microwave the gel first and then... -- Tony? Tony?
all right, Mr. Johns Hopkins, Mr. Biomedical Degree.
you go ahead.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, that's not good. -- Nope.
Aw, knucklehead.
lucky for you Abby's not here, Hopkins.
why is McGee lucky that I'm not there and who is Hopkins?
Abby. Where are you?
I'm at a public hospital just outside the city. That's all I can say.
they even took my cell phone away when I got here, but I was able to open a video port into my lab or... what's left of my lab.
he'll clean it up.
we'll clean up. -- They'll clean it it up.
you'll all clean it up. But I need you to run a background for me first.
background on who? Is everything all right?
I e-mailed the info to McGee.
you didn't answer the question.
everything is fine. Okay, I got to go.
I shouldn't leave this video port open.
and Tony, screwdrivers-- they leave tool marks on locked drawers.
it's our dead guy's car.
and he appears to have been living in it.
well, what is it doing here?
we're almost two miles away from the loading dock where the victim's body was found.
that is a long distance to have wandered after the attack.
well, if there was an attack here.
no sign of a struggle.
there are houses not too far away.
maybe our victim parked here for a planned rendezvous of some kind.
maybe.
this is nice.
being able to work without Tony's incessant babbling.
it is almost as if he cannot go on for more than 30 seconds without hearing his own voice.
you know, the truly amazing thing is that he fails to realize - just how irritating he is to those around him. -- Ziva?
Yes, Gibbs? -- Babbling.
Gibbs? -- What?
victim's trunk.
I'm not so sure our victim was the intended victim.
come in.
Mr. Jones.
any progress?
I'm done.
that was fast.
well, it's pretty esoteric stuff.
basically, Dr. Heller was attempting to hijack DNA's end-joining pathways in order to...
target a specific strand of a person's DNA?
why do I get the feeling you already knew that?
maybe because I already knew that.
was he successful?
he was close. What do you mean you already knew that?
given the sensitive nature of this project,
I had to make sure you were the real McCoy before I fully read you in.
so you lied.
and I didn't lose a minute's sleep. Is that a problem?
no. Not at all. Lie to me again. It was awesome.
nice knowing you. -- Wait. Miss Sciuto.
you can't leave. -- Really? That's funny.
cause it really seems like I'm, you know, leaving.
okay, just out of curiosity, why can't I leave?
because if you don't help us...they're all going to die.
let's hear it.
Hey, did you find anything good at Riggs' car?
actually, yes. We found a...
what is that smell?
still? You're kidding me. I washed my hands a dozen times.
wash them again, McGee.
sorry, boss. Had a little mishap in Abby's lab, running the DNA on Riggs' attacker.
more like Riggs' victim.
the contents of Riggs' trunk suggest he was planning on burying a body.
you think he was on some kind of hit?
until it went bad.
he apparently did not count on his target fighting back.
do we have any idea who his victim was? -- I do.
Palmer and I just finished running the DNA from under Riggs' fingernails.
you already tell Gibbs?
tell Gibbs what?
you found the target. -- What?
this is Dr. Heller. It's the guy Abby wanted us to run background on.
Uh-oh, boss.
Abby was asked to take over for Heller when he went missing.
well, I'm guessing he disappeared because...
someone was trying to kill him.
and Abby has just taken his place.
agent Gibbs, I appreciate your concern for my missing colleague, but that's exactly why Miss Sciuto needs to stay here right now.
you have to trust me on that.
I don't trust you. I don't know you.
I sympathize with your position...
it's your choice!
you either tell me what's going on or...
or what? You'll threaten me?
well, you know what? That depends.
you consider a public investigation a threat?
we are on the same team.
about a year ago, my company became involved in a larger medical study of servicemen returning from Afghanistan.
it was rather routine until we discovered small numbers were suffering from an undiagnosed illness that was originally thought to be fatigue.
we alerted the military.
they didn't want to make the same mistake they did with Gulf War Syndrome.
good. Good for them.
we got a contract to research the illness. We set up this lab.
the hope was, if we could identify the susceptible genotype, a cure could be developed.
okay, well, obviously, somebody there doesn't want that to happen.
we don't know where Dr. Heller is.
all right, his disappearance may have nothing to do with this research.
okay, until... we find out, I want Abby here.
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.
did I just not make myself clear?
you misunderstand me. Miss Sciuto?
Hi, Gibbs.
Oh, hi, Abbs. You all right?
everything's fine, except you and I still have to talk about the lab bunnies.
listen, Gibbs, I know what you're going to say.
you're worried because someone is after the doctor, and if someone's after the doctor and I took over his job, they might be after me.
but I don't care.
these people are sick and I can help them and I'm staying, period.
besides, this is a secure hospital.
I'm just as safe here as I would be at NCIS.
safer, actually, 'cause they have bigger dogs.
I'd tell you not to argue with her, but, uh, I think you already know that.
Afghanistant War Syndrome.
if this guy Heller was working on a cure, why would someone try and kill him?
no connection between PFC Riggs and Heller.
maybe he was a hired gun?
it is likely.
so who hired him? -- Good question, McGee.
got the file from Jones?
Yeah, reading it now.
how is Abby? -- Committed.
you can say that again. She'd be safer here.
best way to protect her is to solve our original case.
find Heller.
we cannot be sure the doctor's disappearance is tied to his work.
and even if it is, he's not going to be easy to find.
the FBI's had a BOLO out since Monday.
Dr. Phillip Heller, not M.D.
got his PhD in molecular biology.
did a post-doc on Gulf War Syndrome.
wife, no kids, was treated for a gambling addiction ten years ago.
which seems to be under control now.
credit card bills are low-- gas, groceries, flowers.
does not spend more than he earns.
he was working at a V.A. hospital when he joined Jones' program.
start with the wife.
on your six, boss.
I love a woman who's good with her hands.
and smart, too.
I thought you said God skimped on the brains.
well, I'm a man of contradictions.
am I interrupting?
Yes.
you got anything else? It's giving me a headache.
thank you. I'm on the run.
it's bath time.
nurse Ratched takes a little bit too much pleasure in it for my taste.
it's a shame, 'cause if she was my type, this would be the setup of a lifetime.
not asking me any questions.
must mean you already got your answers.
you're sick, aren't you? You have it.
take a guess at the first question.
but what is "it"?
that's the million-dollar mystery.
have you finished isolating our genes or whatever it is you're doing down here?
I'm close.
that's what Heller used to say.
look what happened to him.
he, uh... he got...
transferred.
Oh, you're a horrible liar. -- I know.
me, I lied for a living.
used to run some of the biggest black ops in Panama, both Gulf Wars, Afghanistan.
I was very important.
you're still important.
Yeah, as a guinea pig, nothing else, just like him.
that's okay, I guess.
when I signed up, it was because I was willing to die for my country, and I still am.
I dodged a bullet, more than my fair share, but these boys today are-- they...
you know, they drill them to survive gunshot wounds, land mines, air strikes.
nobody warned them about synergistic effects of battlefield contaminants.
check.
sorry, I'm just that good.
we're going to figure this out, you know.
don't make any promises you can't keep.
but I got one that you can.
anything.
whatever this thing is, just don't let them name it after me.
deal.
but you have to do something for me.
anything.
did you really escape from a P.O.W. camp?
twice. Why?
his buddies. Rescue mission.
I'm in.
garage sales. Always a little strange.
I mean, what is this stuff? What is that?
one man's junk is another man's junk.
excuse me, are you Lois Heller?
Yeah.
need to talk to you about your husband.
he's dead.
no, no, we just don't know where he is.
Oh, well, that makes two of us.
what are you-- a, uh, 42 long?
well, that's... When was the last time you spoke to him?
uh, about three days ago, if you could call it speaking.
we don't exactly have what you'd call a good marriage.
Yeah, I'm picking up on that. -- Yeah, here, it's about your size.
he give you any idea where he was?
five bucks. -- I'll give you three. Is this your husband's?
sorry.
all right, look, the FBI have already been here, and I've already told them everything I know.
my husband said he was going out for a walk and he never came back.
far as I'm concerned, he doesn't need to.
you should think about that coat.
it'd look good on you.
Yeah, thanks.
well, I guess we got motive.
doesn't strike me as the kind of girl who'd hire a hit man, though.
no, she'd rather do it herself.
should we bring her in? -- Flowers first.
flowers?
husband's credit card.
don't think he was sending them to her.
girlfriend, right.
we traced the flowers to a house in Landover owned by a Maggie Smith.
she claimed Heller was not there, but I smelled fish.
what?
fishy, something fishy.
we found Dr. Heller hiding inside.
tried to run when he saw us.
he did not get far, and he was carrying this.
a stun gun.
matches the same marks Ducky found on PFC Riggs' neck.
you recognize him?
Yes.
you want to tell me about it?
I had nothing to do with that.
well, then, how did your DNA end up underneath his fingernails?
I would be thrilled to sit here and just charge you with murder.
murder? He tried to kill me.
like I said, you want to tell me about it?
I came home from work three days ago.
needed to clear my head, so I took a walk.
suddenly this guy grabs me, shoves a gun in my face.
I defended myself.
that a crime?
you always carry one of these?
uh, lately.
you didn't go back home, you didn't call the police. Why?
the police? People get mugged all the time.
I figured the guy'd be long gone before the police even got there.
I'm telling you the truth.
I didn't say you weren't.
but you're not.
you didn't go back home because they knew where you lived.
this wasn't a mugging; this was a hit.
that's crazy. A hit on me?
unless you think my wife hired somebody.
I know about the lab and I know about the cure you were researching.
that's classified. -- And that's a dead body!
I already got you at manslaughter.
I can prove intent, I got you at murder. -- Wait...
you tell me what's going on, or you call your damn lawyer!
why is somebody trying to kill you?
because I discovered the truth.
Tarburst tried to hide it.
the tasks were compartmentalized, ostensibly for security purposes.
isolate a genome, find a suitable viral vector. It, uh...
they manipulated me.
all I could see were the technical hurdles and not the big picture.
which was what?
people were sick, but I wasn't working on a cure.
I was building a weapon.
I don't know where they came from, but suddenly there was, like, a dozen rabbits running through the halls.
ready to celebrate?
where is he? -- Hang on a sec.
this is... is Sergeant King's room, right?
it was. I'm sorry.
you family?
does it matter?
not really. Why don't you take a minute.
sorry about that. It's been a long day.
well...
the good news is, I did it.
I isolated the...
never mind.
you would find that so boring.
it's not a cure...
but maybe, someday, it would...
I found her!
Tony. -- You all right?
no. What are you doing here?
the lab is secure.
what's going on?
Abbs, you okay? - Do I look okay?
what is Abby's rule number one?
do not lie to Abby.
we left Heller in charge at the hospital.
unfortunately, someone has already downloaded all of Abby's research.
research? It was a weapon.
people were dying, and I was a building a weapon.
jones is gone. Aide said he left in a hurry.
I'll put out a BOLO.
I'll coordinate with local LEOs.
how bad?
jones had me create an enzyme to target the genomes of the sick soldiers.
is that bad?
by itself, it's innocuous, but then, he had Dr. Heller create an immunogen to help the immune system kill off foreign invaders.
that's bad. --No, it's the way every vaccine works.
Yeah, but when you put them together...
you can target someone via their DNA.
you can infect an entire water supply and only kill your intended victim.
we both made a piece of it.
Heller made the bullet, and I made the gun.
assassination made easy.
but really, I mean, a gun would be easier.
didn't build it to kill someone.
built it to sell it.
perfect.
Hi, I'm Abby Sciuto, international bioweapons dealer.
wait a second. How did Jones get it past his supervisors?
sick soldiers.
you don't ask too many questions.
Oh, my God.
come on, damn it!
come on... No!
Oh, no.
Yeah, Abbs. -- Tony, check your inbox
I need another BOLO ASAP. -- Have you talked to Gibbs?
I didn't talk to Gibbs yet. Just do it!
all right.
I can hear you staring.
What'd you find, Abb?
it's what I didn't find, Gibbs.
I don't think there ever was an Afghanistan War Syndrome.
soldiers were getting sick, 'cause soldiers do, but look at this.
someone in the lab was swapping out their diseased blood with healthy samples.
doctors had sick patients, but normal test results.
they couldn't find a cause.
they thought they had another mystery war syndrome on their hands.
jones tricked the army.
they had no idea what was going on.
he got them to finance the project, and he wasn't alone.
nurse Dunstan was the nurse on call every time there was a blood test.
I thought it was just a coincidence.
she was in on it with Jones.
I should have seen it, Gibbs.
aren't you going to give me a pep talk?
no.
Why?
because you're pissed.
and you should be.
Yeah. Gibbs.
where?
a hiker saw her body being dumped.
get a description? --- Nothing useful.
she was on the way to the coroner when the local LEOs got our BOLO.
an on-site assessment report indicates manual strangulation.
it appears she and Jones had a falling out.
he didn't need her anymore. He was tying up loose ends.
we have a tire print. Abby is running it.
I imagine this must have been quite an ordeal for her.
how is she doing?
much better now.
boss, uh, no luck on the tire prints, but Abby has been monitoring every cell tower in the tri-state area.
she picked up a data fetch from Jones's smartphone.
he was checking airline departure times.
you get an airline? - And a flight number.
you messed with the wrong forensic scientist.
did I miss it? -- No, he's letting him sit.
sit? He gets a chair?
he... He kills bunnies!
I'm impressed.
didn't expect anyone to come looking for me so soon.
one-way ticket to Chile?
you got family there?
I want to make a deal. -- Yeah?
if I cooperate.
Oh, you're going to cooperate.
look, I'm not proud of what I did, but with the budget cutbacks and looking at my pension, I just...
I figured I deserved more.
and you were willing to kill for it?
kill?
he actually seems legitimately surprised.
he does.
what exactly am I under arrest for?
I haven't placed you under arrest.
and when you do?
Oh, my God. -- Murder. Conspiracy to defraud.
throw in medical malpractice.
this is a mistake. I...
so cooperate.
who's your buyer?
my buyer?
I know you're selling the research from Tarburst's program.
I'm not selling anything from the program.
why were you running?
because I was embezzling from it.
I was running because Abby succeeded.
that would mean a GAO audit.
it would uncover what I did.
I planned to be long gone before then.
I just didn't plan it so soon.
look, I have records -- I could prove it.
I don't know anything about a conspiracy.
liar!
sorry, Gibbs.
you set up the lab so you could sell my research!
I did not set up the lab. I don't know who did set up the lab.
I was ordered to run the lab-- that's what I did.
sergeant King didn't get the help he needed because you falsified his medical records.
who?
you don't even know his name.
sergeant Robert King.
he's one of the patients in your program.
I know everyone's name in that program. There is no Sergeant King.
find him.
you look pretty good for a dead guy, except for the blood draining out of your face.
Tom, right?
that's your real name, isn't it?
what did I do wrong?
you made me care about you.
you're under arrest for the murder of Nurse Hannah Dunstan.
that is correct, and many, many more bad things, because you're a very bad man.
little tip: next time you're playing chess with a forensic specialist...
wear gloves. -- And try to find better help.
your little buddy, PFC Riggs, was sending you unencrypted e-mails.
might as well put a big bull's-eye on your laptop.
Why?
kept you from asking too many questions.
and I like to stay close when I'm running an op.
an op?
Op-- is that what you call betraying your country?
you have no idea what I've done for my country.
Yeah, I do; I read your file.
you're the go-to guy for setting up black ops, right?
specialty was bioweapons defense research.
figured it was time to branch out, do a little freelancing?
like I said, I'm a man of contradictions.
all right, here we go.
is that it?
that all you have to say?
checkmate.
thought she wasn't coming in.
neither did I.
Vance told her to take a week off.
maybe she wanted to work.
what are you doing down here?
I don't know. I got, uh, an e-mail from Gibbs.
told me to meet him down here in the lab. - So did I.
probies first.
come on... Gibbs doesn't use e-mail.
Hi, guys.
we've been set up.
are you happy?
you asked me to get you some ice cream.
did I tell you to blend it?
I didn't remember the blender being that loud before.
and this morning, you didn't remember that the dryer beeps on wrinkle guard.
it was a beep-- a single beep!
how can something with such little ears have such bionic hearing?
okay.
help me... please...
please help me.
must you do that now, Tony?
it's spring. I'm spring-cleaning, so... yes.
Spring-cleaning?
you don't have spring-cleaning in Israel?
we do not have spring. Israel is a desert .
I've been looking for this.
Ah, yeah.
I remember those days, when I was carefree and full of joy.
I envy you, Tony.
why are you dressed for a funeral, Abby?
everything okay? -- No.
Frank is sick.
who is Frank?
my mandibular second molar.
it's been killing me for a week. I'm finally going to the dentist.
you name your teeth?
you don't?
no.
see, that's the problem.
they're just teeth to you.
but evolutionarily speaking, your survival is directly proportionate to their health.
a cavity was a death sentence on the savannah.
Abby, everyone gets cavities.
no. No Sciuto has had a cavity since 1922.
good genes. - Genes?
I brush, and I floss, and I tongue-scrape more than most people would consider sane.
I have earned my perfect record.
no cavities, no surrender.
I don't deserve this.
I'll be back before lunch. -- Good luck.
don't get too comfortable. Dead body.
come on... you all know the drill.
he looks cold.
that's the least of his problems, McGee.
Hey, boss. Parents didn't have much to add.
baby's room was empty, except for the baby.
they kept hearing the voice through the baby monitor.
cops did a search of the area.
all they found was him.
they identified the body as Marine Private First Class Marco Riggs.
and I am identifying some pretty gnarly toes.
this guy needed a pedicure.
bothers you so much, DiNozzo, go find his shoes.
boss, I'm going to go find his shoes.
this would explain the voice the parents heard.
our dead guy had a military-issue cell scanner.
not exactly standard-issue for privates.
that's probably why he was misusing it.
take a look at the display, boss.
looks like Riggs was trying to use the cell scanner as a cell phone.
ended up broadcasting in a narrowband frequency.
got picked up by the baby monitor.
Yeah, I don't know about the feet, though.
that's because you don't know your history, McGee.
historically, going about unshod was considered by some to be an act of pious devotion, while others...
believed that direct contact with Mother Earth provided spiritual benefits.
however, in Roman and medieval times, going barefoot symbolized poverty, since leather and boots were too expensive for the average...
Really?
I-I... I wrote a paper on, uh... Never mind.
cyanosis indicates lack of oxygen.
no signs of strangulation or ligature marks.
did you write a paper on those, too?
time of death... two hours ago.
that a problem?
Mr. Palmer, help me with the body.
Yes, well, he's remarkably stiff for the recently deceased.
it's too soon for rigor, even at this temperature.
there's no...entry wounds, no sign of trauma, but something sucked the life out of him.
sucked the life out is right.
Abby is going to love this.
thank you! What a way to start the day.
maybe? -- FBI.
you need to come with us, Ms. Sciuto. Now.
where? - I'm not at liberty to say.
well, then, I'm not at liberty to go.
you misunderstand. It's not a request.
the deceased was Private First Class Marco Riggs.
recently assigned to CLB-3, Combat Logistical Battalion, supporting troops in Afghanistan.
until he was accused of stealing equipment, then selling it on the black market.
that include military-issue cell scanners?
it did, but Riggs disappeared before he could be formerly charged.
he's been listed UA since last week.
apartment was a dead end.
we have a BOLO out on his vehicle.
also waiting on the blood work from Abby.
well, we're going to have to wait a little bit longer.
Oh, don't tell me she needs a root canal.
no, Fornell just called.
Abby's been... requested.
requested? -- By...?
he didn't know. It just said the FBI has orders to transport her.
okay, I can access the FBI operations database.
I have a contact at the DOD.
bolo out on the FBI transport?
I don't know. I thought... maybe I'd just try to call her first.
Hey, Gibbs. Don't worry. No cavities. I was going to call.
Fornell already did. You okay?
Yep.
where are you?
in the back of a van. -- Abby...
I'm fine. It's exciting.
group of FBI agents swoops in and steals away an unsuspecting citizen to places unknown.
Yeah, it's the unknown part I don't care for.
Oh, I got Palmer's text about the vampire bite.
I can't believe I'm not going to be there for that.
who are you getting to fill in?
working on it.
well, if you need anything before then,
I keep a step-by-step Abby's Lab for Dummies in my desk.
it covers the basics.
a monkey could follow the instructions.
good. -- Oh, God...
cause we got one of those.
did you realize that the end was nigh, I wonder, or was it a blissful event as your ego and judgment melted away?
I mean, a stroke from... -- Doctor?
Yes, Mr. Palmer.
may I stop mopping now?
it depends. -- On?
has it enhanced your understanding of protocol?
consider me enhanced.
good -- then you may join me.
that invitation extend to me, too, Duck?
since when have you waited for an invitation? Don't answer that.
I know you like to keep people on their toes.
Mr. Palmer... -- Yes, Doctor.
protocol. -- What?
okay, yes. I will go not be in this room now.
what do you got?
well, sadly for Abby, not the walking dead.
a histological examination of these wounds reveal that they're burn marks, not punctures.
more consistent with a stun gun attack than a vampire bite.
a stun gun?
not normally a lethal weapon.
however, I believe the electrical shock aggravated an underlying arterial weakness in his brain, and that led to a hemorrhagic stroke.
after he regained consciousness, he would've been severely confused.
he could've wandered around for hours before taking refuge on that loading dock.
then he took his shoes off?
Yeah, well, it's called peripheral neuropathy.
it's common in this kind of stroke.
his feet would have felt as if they were burning up, but I doubt that he knew what he was doing.
towards the end, he would have been delirious, until eventually, his heart would have given out.
stun gun's a defensive weapon, Duck.
Yeah.
which suggests his death was unintentional.
Ooh, I found something under his fingernails.
it almost certainly came from the assailant during the assault.
I need to send it up to Abby's replacement.
well, that's going to be a long run, Ducky.
just spoke to the DOD, boss.
Abby's replacement doesn't arrive until Monday. - -Monday?
Monday. I made a lot of noise, but, you know, they gave me a lecture about budget cuts.
we did catch a break, though.
got a BOLO back from our dead guy's car.
want me to take Ziva, or...
no, I'll take Ziva.
you, uh... you take McGee.
take McGee where?
Abby's LAB FOR DUMMIES
now, why did I get picked for the cover art?
you want to sign, or should I?
I will.
I am the one with a biomedical engineering degree from Johns Hopkins.
among several other degrees.
maybe that's why you got picked for the cover art.
come in.
ma'am.
Yes.
from NCIS? -- Yep.
I, uh, asked you here...
asked me. That's a good one.
at the request of Dr. Phillip Heller.
he's in charge of a... rather special project.
is it a military project?
funded by the military, but Tarburst is an independent agency.
I'm not familiar with Dr. Heller's work.
no, but he is with yours.
he was quite impressed with your paper on Zinc Finger Nucleases in DNA Binding.
what kind of project are we talking about exactly?
uh, not the kind of project we can talk about.
it's why I was reluctant to allow your participation initially.
this is a highly classified matter.
so, what changed?
Dr. Heller is no longer with the program, and we-- your country-- need your help.
what do you need?
welcome to The Cave.
the Cave?
you should rename this place Nirvana.
Dr. Heller was given a sizable budget.
I can see that.
and almost complete autonomy.
all information was compartmentalized, strictly need-to-know.
only three other people, besides myself, even knew of the existence of this program.
knew?
two of the original team members died in a roadside bomb attack in Afghanistan.
which is why Dr. Heller's departure from the program has become quite a problem.
this was sold to the Senate Select Committee on a warning of a grave and gathering threat.
what exactly was Dr. Heller working on?
that's the problem. We don't know.
patients aren't allowed on this floor.
how did you get in here?
it's a hospital, isn't it? How do you think?
no, he hospital's upstairs. This is...
I know what this is, Sunshine.
I've escaped from P.O.W. camps with better security.
just exercising the lungs.
retired Marine.
sergeant Major Robert King, N. C.
not contagious. In case you were worried.
I was.
Where's Heller?
we got a game to finish.
Dr. Heller, he's, uh...
he's no longer with the project.
he isn't, huh? -- No.
well, doesn't that seem a little strange?
I mean, you know, considering.
considering what?
God gave you a body, I'll give him that.
skimped on the brain, though.
don't know how well you know the doctor, but if you knew Heller, - you'd know he wouldn't run off and leave all this. -- King?
she found me.
who? -- Nurse Dunstan.
makes Al Qaeda look like Jiminy Cricket.
I'm sorry.
he knows he's not supposed to come down here.
none of the patients are supposed to come down here.
I won't tell.
thank you. -- Let's go.
next time you get out of bed, I'm having you catheterized.
you wish.
nurse Dunstan --Your liaison with the hospital.
if you need anything, extension 405.
thank you.
and the lab rabbits should be here by 12: 00.
hopefully this batch lasts longer than the last. Quick march.
are you gonna help me, or are you gonna keep screwing around back there?
every single drawer in this lab is unlocked except this one.
you're not wondering what's inside?
I'm wondering where Palmer is with the rest of that DNA.
Oh, right here. Here you go. Thought I might be able to help you guys.
I do have lab experience.
and I have a biomedical engineering degree from Johns Hopkins.
he sure does love saying that.
Hey, will you put the screwdriver down, come in here, and hand me the ethidium bromide, please?
Oh, I got it.
I don't think that's right...
I don't think you're supposed to do that.
all right.
next step is to, mix the gel with the ethidium bromide.
I don't think you're supposed to do that.
I think you're supposed to microwave the gel first and then... -- Tony? Tony?
all right, Mr. Johns Hopkins, Mr. Biomedical Degree.
you go ahead.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, that's not good. -- Nope.
Aw, knucklehead.
lucky for you Abby's not here, Hopkins.
why is McGee lucky that I'm not there and who is Hopkins?
Abby. Where are you?
I'm at a public hospital just outside the city. That's all I can say.
they even took my cell phone away when I got here, but I was able to open a video port into my lab or... what's left of my lab.
he'll clean it up.
we'll clean up. -- They'll clean it it up.
you'll all clean it up. But I need you to run a background for me first.
background on who? Is everything all right?
I e-mailed the info to McGee.
you didn't answer the question.
everything is fine. Okay, I got to go.
I shouldn't leave this video port open.
and Tony, screwdrivers-- they leave tool marks on locked drawers.
it's our dead guy's car.
and he appears to have been living in it.
well, what is it doing here?
we're almost two miles away from the loading dock where the victim's body was found.
that is a long distance to have wandered after the attack.
well, if there was an attack here.
no sign of a struggle.
there are houses not too far away.
maybe our victim parked here for a planned rendezvous of some kind.
maybe.
this is nice.
being able to work without Tony's incessant babbling.
it is almost as if he cannot go on for more than 30 seconds without hearing his own voice.
you know, the truly amazing thing is that he fails to realize - just how irritating he is to those around him. -- Ziva?
Yes, Gibbs? -- Babbling.
Gibbs? -- What?
victim's trunk.
I'm not so sure our victim was the intended victim.
come in.
Mr. Jones.
any progress?
I'm done.
that was fast.
well, it's pretty esoteric stuff.
basically, Dr. Heller was attempting to hijack DNA's end-joining pathways in order to...
target a specific strand of a person's DNA?
why do I get the feeling you already knew that?
maybe because I already knew that.
was he successful?
he was close. What do you mean you already knew that?
given the sensitive nature of this project,
I had to make sure you were the real McCoy before I fully read you in.
so you lied.
and I didn't lose a minute's sleep. Is that a problem?
no. Not at all. Lie to me again. It was awesome.
nice knowing you. -- Wait. Miss Sciuto.
you can't leave. -- Really? That's funny.
cause it really seems like I'm, you know, leaving.
okay, just out of curiosity, why can't I leave?
because if you don't help us...they're all going to die.
let's hear it.
Hey, did you find anything good at Riggs' car?
actually, yes. We found a...
what is that smell?
still? You're kidding me. I washed my hands a dozen times.
wash them again, McGee.
sorry, boss. Had a little mishap in Abby's lab, running the DNA on Riggs' attacker.
more like Riggs' victim.
the contents of Riggs' trunk suggest he was planning on burying a body.
you think he was on some kind of hit?
until it went bad.
he apparently did not count on his target fighting back.
do we have any idea who his victim was? -- I do.
Palmer and I just finished running the DNA from under Riggs' fingernails.
you already tell Gibbs?
tell Gibbs what?
you found the target. -- What?
this is Dr. Heller. It's the guy Abby wanted us to run background on.
Uh-oh, boss.
Abby was asked to take over for Heller when he went missing.
well, I'm guessing he disappeared because...
someone was trying to kill him.
and Abby has just taken his place.
agent Gibbs, I appreciate your concern for my missing colleague, but that's exactly why Miss Sciuto needs to stay here right now.
you have to trust me on that.
I don't trust you. I don't know you.
I sympathize with your position...
it's your choice!
you either tell me what's going on or...
or what? You'll threaten me?
well, you know what? That depends.
you consider a public investigation a threat?
we are on the same team.
about a year ago, my company became involved in a larger medical study of servicemen returning from Afghanistan.
it was rather routine until we discovered small numbers were suffering from an undiagnosed illness that was originally thought to be fatigue.
we alerted the military.
they didn't want to make the same mistake they did with Gulf War Syndrome.
good. Good for them.
we got a contract to research the illness. We set up this lab.
the hope was, if we could identify the susceptible genotype, a cure could be developed.
okay, well, obviously, somebody there doesn't want that to happen.
we don't know where Dr. Heller is.
all right, his disappearance may have nothing to do with this research.
okay, until... we find out, I want Abby here.
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.
did I just not make myself clear?
you misunderstand me. Miss Sciuto?
Hi, Gibbs.
Oh, hi, Abbs. You all right?
everything's fine, except you and I still have to talk about the lab bunnies.
listen, Gibbs, I know what you're going to say.
you're worried because someone is after the doctor, and if someone's after the doctor and I took over his job, they might be after me.
but I don't care.
these people are sick and I can help them and I'm staying, period.
besides, this is a secure hospital.
I'm just as safe here as I would be at NCIS.
safer, actually, 'cause they have bigger dogs.
I'd tell you not to argue with her, but, uh, I think you already know that.
Afghanistant War Syndrome.
if this guy Heller was working on a cure, why would someone try and kill him?
no connection between PFC Riggs and Heller.
maybe he was a hired gun?
it is likely.
so who hired him? -- Good question, McGee.
got the file from Jones?
Yeah, reading it now.
how is Abby? -- Committed.
you can say that again. She'd be safer here.
best way to protect her is to solve our original case.
find Heller.
we cannot be sure the doctor's disappearance is tied to his work.
and even if it is, he's not going to be easy to find.
the FBI's had a BOLO out since Monday.
Dr. Phillip Heller, not M.D.
got his PhD in molecular biology.
did a post-doc on Gulf War Syndrome.
wife, no kids, was treated for a gambling addiction ten years ago.
which seems to be under control now.
credit card bills are low-- gas, groceries, flowers.
does not spend more than he earns.
he was working at a V.A. hospital when he joined Jones' program.
start with the wife.
on your six, boss.
I love a woman who's good with her hands.
and smart, too.
I thought you said God skimped on the brains.
well, I'm a man of contradictions.
am I interrupting?
Yes.
you got anything else? It's giving me a headache.
thank you. I'm on the run.
it's bath time.
nurse Ratched takes a little bit too much pleasure in it for my taste.
it's a shame, 'cause if she was my type, this would be the setup of a lifetime.
not asking me any questions.
must mean you already got your answers.
you're sick, aren't you? You have it.
take a guess at the first question.
but what is "it"?
that's the million-dollar mystery.
have you finished isolating our genes or whatever it is you're doing down here?
I'm close.
that's what Heller used to say.
look what happened to him.
he, uh... he got...
transferred.
Oh, you're a horrible liar. -- I know.
me, I lied for a living.
used to run some of the biggest black ops in Panama, both Gulf Wars, Afghanistan.
I was very important.
you're still important.
Yeah, as a guinea pig, nothing else, just like him.
that's okay, I guess.
when I signed up, it was because I was willing to die for my country, and I still am.
I dodged a bullet, more than my fair share, but these boys today are-- they...
you know, they drill them to survive gunshot wounds, land mines, air strikes.
nobody warned them about synergistic effects of battlefield contaminants.
check.
sorry, I'm just that good.
we're going to figure this out, you know.
don't make any promises you can't keep.
but I got one that you can.
anything.
whatever this thing is, just don't let them name it after me.
deal.
but you have to do something for me.
anything.
did you really escape from a P.O.W. camp?
twice. Why?
his buddies. Rescue mission.
I'm in.
garage sales. Always a little strange.
I mean, what is this stuff? What is that?
one man's junk is another man's junk.
excuse me, are you Lois Heller?
Yeah.
need to talk to you about your husband.
he's dead.
no, no, we just don't know where he is.
Oh, well, that makes two of us.
what are you-- a, uh, 42 long?
well, that's... When was the last time you spoke to him?
uh, about three days ago, if you could call it speaking.
we don't exactly have what you'd call a good marriage.
Yeah, I'm picking up on that. -- Yeah, here, it's about your size.
he give you any idea where he was?
five bucks. -- I'll give you three. Is this your husband's?
sorry.
all right, look, the FBI have already been here, and I've already told them everything I know.
my husband said he was going out for a walk and he never came back.
far as I'm concerned, he doesn't need to.
you should think about that coat.
it'd look good on you.
Yeah, thanks.
well, I guess we got motive.
doesn't strike me as the kind of girl who'd hire a hit man, though.
no, she'd rather do it herself.
should we bring her in? -- Flowers first.
flowers?
husband's credit card.
don't think he was sending them to her.
girlfriend, right.
we traced the flowers to a house in Landover owned by a Maggie Smith.
she claimed Heller was not there, but I smelled fish.
what?
fishy, something fishy.
we found Dr. Heller hiding inside.
tried to run when he saw us.
he did not get far, and he was carrying this.
a stun gun.
matches the same marks Ducky found on PFC Riggs' neck.
you recognize him?
Yes.
you want to tell me about it?
I had nothing to do with that.
well, then, how did your DNA end up underneath his fingernails?
I would be thrilled to sit here and just charge you with murder.
murder? He tried to kill me.
like I said, you want to tell me about it?
I came home from work three days ago.
needed to clear my head, so I took a walk.
suddenly this guy grabs me, shoves a gun in my face.
I defended myself.
that a crime?
you always carry one of these?
uh, lately.
you didn't go back home, you didn't call the police. Why?
the police? People get mugged all the time.
I figured the guy'd be long gone before the police even got there.
I'm telling you the truth.
I didn't say you weren't.
but you're not.
you didn't go back home because they knew where you lived.
this wasn't a mugging; this was a hit.
that's crazy. A hit on me?
unless you think my wife hired somebody.
I know about the lab and I know about the cure you were researching.
that's classified. -- And that's a dead body!
I already got you at manslaughter.
I can prove intent, I got you at murder. -- Wait...
you tell me what's going on, or you call your damn lawyer!
why is somebody trying to kill you?
because I discovered the truth.
Tarburst tried to hide it.
the tasks were compartmentalized, ostensibly for security purposes.
isolate a genome, find a suitable viral vector. It, uh...
they manipulated me.
all I could see were the technical hurdles and not the big picture.
which was what?
people were sick, but I wasn't working on a cure.
I was building a weapon.
I don't know where they came from, but suddenly there was, like, a dozen rabbits running through the halls.
ready to celebrate?
where is he? -- Hang on a sec.
this is... is Sergeant King's room, right?
it was. I'm sorry.
you family?
does it matter?
not really. Why don't you take a minute.
sorry about that. It's been a long day.
well...
the good news is, I did it.
I isolated the...
never mind.
you would find that so boring.
it's not a cure...
but maybe, someday, it would...
I found her!
Tony. -- You all right?
no. What are you doing here?
the lab is secure.
what's going on?
Abbs, you okay? - Do I look okay?
what is Abby's rule number one?
do not lie to Abby.
we left Heller in charge at the hospital.
unfortunately, someone has already downloaded all of Abby's research.
research? It was a weapon.
people were dying, and I was a building a weapon.
jones is gone. Aide said he left in a hurry.
I'll put out a BOLO.
I'll coordinate with local LEOs.
how bad?
jones had me create an enzyme to target the genomes of the sick soldiers.
is that bad?
by itself, it's innocuous, but then, he had Dr. Heller create an immunogen to help the immune system kill off foreign invaders.
that's bad. --No, it's the way every vaccine works.
Yeah, but when you put them together...
you can target someone via their DNA.
you can infect an entire water supply and only kill your intended victim.
we both made a piece of it.
Heller made the bullet, and I made the gun.
assassination made easy.
but really, I mean, a gun would be easier.
didn't build it to kill someone.
built it to sell it.
perfect.
Hi, I'm Abby Sciuto, international bioweapons dealer.
wait a second. How did Jones get it past his supervisors?
sick soldiers.
you don't ask too many questions.
Oh, my God.
come on, damn it!
come on... No!
Oh, no.
Yeah, Abbs. -- Tony, check your inbox
I need another BOLO ASAP. -- Have you talked to Gibbs?
I didn't talk to Gibbs yet. Just do it!
all right.
I can hear you staring.
What'd you find, Abb?
it's what I didn't find, Gibbs.
I don't think there ever was an Afghanistan War Syndrome.
soldiers were getting sick, 'cause soldiers do, but look at this.
someone in the lab was swapping out their diseased blood with healthy samples.
doctors had sick patients, but normal test results.
they couldn't find a cause.
they thought they had another mystery war syndrome on their hands.
jones tricked the army.
they had no idea what was going on.
he got them to finance the project, and he wasn't alone.
nurse Dunstan was the nurse on call every time there was a blood test.
I thought it was just a coincidence.
she was in on it with Jones.
I should have seen it, Gibbs.
aren't you going to give me a pep talk?
no.
Why?
because you're pissed.
and you should be.
Yeah. Gibbs.
where?
a hiker saw her body being dumped.
get a description? --- Nothing useful.
she was on the way to the coroner when the local LEOs got our BOLO.
an on-site assessment report indicates manual strangulation.
it appears she and Jones had a falling out.
he didn't need her anymore. He was tying up loose ends.
we have a tire print. Abby is running it.
I imagine this must have been quite an ordeal for her.
how is she doing?
much better now.
boss, uh, no luck on the tire prints, but Abby has been monitoring every cell tower in the tri-state area.
she picked up a data fetch from Jones's smartphone.
he was checking airline departure times.
you get an airline? - And a flight number.
you messed with the wrong forensic scientist.
did I miss it? -- No, he's letting him sit.
sit? He gets a chair?
he... He kills bunnies!
I'm impressed.
didn't expect anyone to come looking for me so soon.
one-way ticket to Chile?
you got family there?
I want to make a deal. -- Yeah?
if I cooperate.
Oh, you're going to cooperate.
look, I'm not proud of what I did, but with the budget cutbacks and looking at my pension, I just...
I figured I deserved more.
and you were willing to kill for it?
kill?
he actually seems legitimately surprised.
he does.
what exactly am I under arrest for?
I haven't placed you under arrest.
and when you do?
Oh, my God. -- Murder. Conspiracy to defraud.
throw in medical malpractice.
this is a mistake. I...
so cooperate.
who's your buyer?
my buyer?
I know you're selling the research from Tarburst's program.
I'm not selling anything from the program.
why were you running?
because I was embezzling from it.
I was running because Abby succeeded.
that would mean a GAO audit.
it would uncover what I did.
I planned to be long gone before then.
I just didn't plan it so soon.
look, I have records -- I could prove it.
I don't know anything about a conspiracy.
liar!
sorry, Gibbs.
you set up the lab so you could sell my research!
I did not set up the lab. I don't know who did set up the lab.
I was ordered to run the lab-- that's what I did.
sergeant King didn't get the help he needed because you falsified his medical records.
who?
you don't even know his name.
sergeant Robert King.
he's one of the patients in your program.
I know everyone's name in that program. There is no Sergeant King.
find him.
you look pretty good for a dead guy, except for the blood draining out of your face.
Tom, right?
that's your real name, isn't it?
what did I do wrong?
you made me care about you.
you're under arrest for the murder of Nurse Hannah Dunstan.
that is correct, and many, many more bad things, because you're a very bad man.
little tip: next time you're playing chess with a forensic specialist...
wear gloves. -- And try to find better help.
your little buddy, PFC Riggs, was sending you unencrypted e-mails.
might as well put a big bull's-eye on your laptop.
Why?
kept you from asking too many questions.
and I like to stay close when I'm running an op.
an op?
Op-- is that what you call betraying your country?
you have no idea what I've done for my country.
Yeah, I do; I read your file.
you're the go-to guy for setting up black ops, right?
specialty was bioweapons defense research.
figured it was time to branch out, do a little freelancing?
like I said, I'm a man of contradictions.
all right, here we go.
is that it?
that all you have to say?
checkmate.
thought she wasn't coming in.
neither did I.
Vance told her to take a week off.
maybe she wanted to work.
what are you doing down here?
I don't know. I got, uh, an e-mail from Gibbs.
told me to meet him down here in the lab. - So did I.
probies first.
come on... Gibbs doesn't use e-mail.
Hi, guys.
we've been set up.
always get this much excitement before you've left port?
what can I say? We like to keep on our toes.
this is your final warning!
identify yourself immediately!
this is your final warning!
put a light on 'em.
it's just a small sailboat. It must have slipped around the curtain.
looks like a hand-built Amigo Kit, but I don't think we have to worry about it being an attack unless they suicided a little early.
two bodies. It's a bloodbath.
get divers in the water, wrangle that craft.
it's a crime scene now.
looks like it's got your name on it, Agent Cortez.
it's not my name, but it is labeled.
you do realize this is a trap?
she's practically inviting us to mess with her.
well, what kind of a man would I be if I turned down such an enticing invitation?
well, you wouldn't be a sucker.
touch me and die. - Good, you're awake.
sleeping on the job isn't going to help you shed that "probie" tag.
I have been on the job since 1: 00 in the morning when Gibbs called me in to cover.
he flew out late last night with Vance and Ducky-- some case in the San Diego Harbor.
Ducky means bodies. They called you to cover?
I believe you call this hazing.
we call this the Bill of Rights.
are you studying to become a naturalized American citizen?
I have to if I want to become an agent.
good for you, Ziva.
wait a second. Who says we want her as an American?
who says you have a say?
a little thing called the Constitution.
Oh, really? Where?
it's in there, and it talks about dangerous foreign aliens stealing our precious bodily fluids.
that's Dr. Strangelove.
we'll be lucky to have you, Ziva. The more the merrier.
laissez-faire immigration policy like that is what Rush Limbaugh says led to the greatest economic crisis in the history of our fantastic nation.
do you have any idea what you're talking about?
you bet your ass I do. I'm talking about the American Dream.
what do you know about the American Dream?
well, let's see, I'm a white male between the ages of 18 and 49 with a loud mouth and a gun.
Oh, thank God.
agent McGee.
2 dead bodies, McGee. Photos coming your way. Tell Abby to clear the decks.
okay, what are we looking at, boss?
I don't know yet.
I secured the crime scene, Director, and began to process it.
I ran the VIN and found the boat was registered to an NCIS Agent Gibbs.
that's you, right? So what's the deal? What's with the dead guys?
shell casings, Izzy? - Bagged and tagged, sir.
I take it you didn't move the bodies.
no, Doctor. I was trained better than that.
there's no identification in their pockets, Jethro, only cash.
dollars and pesos.
agent Cortez, if you didn't know that this boat, loaded with dead bodies, belonged to an NCIS agent, how do you think it ended up rolling into a naval base?
I'd speculate, given the currents, it came from the south, somewhere in Mexico possibly.
as for who might have set it on its course, I wouldn't think to guess.
you usually light the thing on fire for a Viking funeral.
you know any Vikings who live in Mexico?
this does have more of a Wild West feel to it.
solved it already?
glad I made the trip.
you've only taken one vacation this year, Jethro.
sailed the Gulf route to Mexico, right?
one-way plane ticket back.
did I have the fish or did I have the lasagna?
I left him with the boat.
he trailered it to the west coast.
it was a gift for my goddaughter.
this is how he repays you.
what's going on here. You guys already know who the killer is?
agent Cortez, use your contacts with the Federales.
clear a path for us.
we're headed south of the border.
it's not going to be necessary.
are you sure?
nobody's home.
so where is he?
where the hell is Mike Franks?
that's...?
it's no longer in...?
this is Gibbs' boat?
this is the crime scene.
it was flown here in a C-130 cargo plane along with two bodies and all the evidence, and now it is mine.
it is all mine...
so I can figure out the mystery.
what mystery-- who the dead guys were?
or who killed them?
or how they ended up on the boat?
sure, you guys should work on that while I figure out how he got it out of the basement.
flagged all of Franks' known aliases. No hits yet.
well, God knows he's got a head start on us.
Ducky says that those bodies have been floating around for at least three days.
AFIS kick out any I. D.s yet?
they both have military backgrounds.
they were both dishonorably discharged.
blanchard was army. Keenan washed out of the navy a couple years ago.
Mike Franks was already retired.
so no professional connection.
Cortez has got a contact in Mexico, says these two guys were going around asking about Mike Franks last week.
you sifted through family members, common friends in the service?
couldn't find anyone with a grudge.
is that where your gut's leading you, Gibbs?
we got two guys looking for Franks, who really doesn't want to be found.
they find him on the boat, he gets the drop.
shoved 'em off and disappeared.
that last part's the part I really don't like.
if he's gone to ground, that means this isn't over yet.
you got any idea where he might be?
no, your guess is as good as mine, Leon.
for some reason, I doubt that's true, but I'm gonna give you some leeway on this, Gibbs, since it is your friend, your boat, your mess.
my patience will evaporate quickly if another body shows up before Franks does.
I've only just begun, Jethro.
I'm afraid you've jumped the gun.
that's an interesting choice of words, Duck.
how positively Freudian of me.
well, I was going to say "deliberate
well, I can tell you they were shot over and over and over again
a total of six in one and five in the other at close range with a large-caliber weapon.
got something against cowboys, Duck?
although I've always been fond of the way that element manifests itself in you, Jethro,
I have never been entirely comfortable with the psychological makeup of your mentor.
but Wyatt Earp was friends with Doc Holliday, and as they would attest, there is a fine line between cowboy and outlaw.
and with the level of overkill here, your conclusion is...
Mike Franks has crossed that line.
too soon to accuse him of being an unthinking killer, Ducky.
no, that's not what I'm saying at all. It's quite the opposite.
I think a great deal of thought went into these killings and the staging of the crime scene.
Staging?
wood splinters taken from their backsides.
they were dragged onto the Kelly intentionally.
I'd be surprised if anything about her discovery was not intentional.
I assure you I am using the utmost care processing your beautiful craftsmanship.
it's a craftsman's ship.
Abby, the bodies were moved?
if Ducky said they "slad" them...
the firefight, Abby, was it on board?
at first glance, I have a lot of downward vectors.
downward, meaning standing over the top.
execution style, yeah. Pow, pow!
so I'm trying to find corresponding slugs for all the spent 45 casings.
I would say that it ended here, but it may not be where it started.
another bullet grazed the port side.
it's smaller caliber than the others.
22 - Could be.
22s deteriorate significantly on impact, so there's no slug and it's below the waterline.
boat wasn't in the water during the shoot-out.
maybe, or maybe somebody was using it for target practice.
it's one of many inconsistencies that have to be addressed.
there's the angles of trajectory to calculate, and all of the unaccounted-for slugs
I still have to dig them out of the woodwork
I mean, I have to carefully extract them from the woodwork.
take it apart.
are you sure?
similar-size deposits on roughly the same dates suggest that Blanchard and Keenan worked together, but the receipts are all cash.
can't make a financial link to Franks.
now, why would two bad guys go after Mike Franks?
well, clearly, they don't know him very well.
interesting theory, McGee.
I meant that more as a joke.
some of the greatest ideas in history started out as jokes.
I mean, look, you got your mood ring, pet rock, spork.
those were all terrible ideas. - Yes.
terrible ideas that turned their inventors into drillionaires.
and that is the American dream, Ziva.
and that's why you're never going to pass that test.
the heart of America is that any idiot can become a success?
that is exactly right-- 'cause we don't live in an aristocracy or a meritocracy.
neither does Israel.
we just have our capitalist democracy.
which means that you might be a pauper today, you might be living a life of wall-to-wall desperation.
you might have no friends, no prospects, no brain, no hope.
but tomorrow?
tomorrow, you might win the lottery.
you might slip on the right driveway.
tomorrow. Just like Annie sang.
the comic strip? Little Orphan Annie.
curly red hair, no eyeballs. Adopted by Daddy Warbucks.
and that's the American dream right there.
little Orphan Annie. And me.
isn't there an essay section on this citizenship exam?
you should be writing this stuff down. It's good.
shame. My pencil broke.
destruction of U. S.Government property.
that's not going to look too good on the...
Oh, hey, boss, we've been researching the dead guys.
McGee had an interesting idea.
uh, what was that exactly?
because you just started talking a bunch of nonsense and never actually said what you were thinking.
what I was thinking, boss, is maybe they didn't know Franks... at all. You know?
find the connection.
but maybe they...
it's okay. We're here.
look, Amira. It's your godfather. Can you say hi?
Hello, Amira. Welcome to my home.
he's right behind us.
you can put her down in there.
thank you.
you going to stand there glaring at me, probie, or you going to give me a hand with the bags?
or you going to shoot me?
no, I thought I'd ask you a few questions first.
then, I may shoot you. - All right.
need some answers, Mike. - All right!
keep your voice down.
those two men you killed-- why were they after you?
damn, probie.
I was hoping you could tell me.
saturday, I popped in the cantina for a mescal.
the bartender, Eddie, tells me a couple of guys had been asking around.
looking for a gringo and two girls.
claims he did his best to lead them astray.
you didn't know them.
I'd never seen either of their faces before they showed up on my beach Monday afternoon.
but you were ready for them.
I knew what they wanted.
I could see the cannons tucked in their backs.
don't even think about it.
I didn't feel great using Amira's boat like that.
but I couldn't risk being investigated by strangers...
or worse even, the Federales.
so, you steered them at the navy.
if you're going to be investigated, better it be by a friend.
thanks for the honor.
you don't sound too grateful.
you know, Mike...
I'm used to shells and bodies and cover-ups as your big finale.
something starts off like this, I don't even want to think about the count.
you can't pin all them past capers on me, probie.
not all them messes were mine.
where was Leyla and Amira?
you don't think I'd start throwing shots with my daughter-in-law and my granddaughter not safely tucked away, do you?
I'm not a child. - No, you definitely are not.
you calling me old?
I'm saying there comes a time to hang up your spurs.
I won't need you or anybody to tell me when that is. I'll know.
cause I'll be dead.
I hate when you talk like that.
I wouldn't do anything to put my girls in danger.
that's why I brought them here.
and if you can't find out who's after me and why, then I've got no choice, but to...
Mike... do not say it.
ain't I allowed to say anything?
he's threatening to leave us.
he says it is the only way to keep us safe-- to stay away.
when Liam died...
I made a promise to my son and to myself.
I protect my family.
well, from here on, you leave it to the professionals.
these two guys are professionals.
or were.
PMCs-- private military contractors.
according to a Captain Hazelton we spoke to, one of his former classmates, Blanchard, cracked up.
before he could get his act together, he was out the door.
Keenan? - Lot of problems with authority.
well, at least according to every authority we spoke to.
they both got kicked out of their respective services, but they both found new homes in...
Oh, new homes.
give me your tired, "your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...
the, uh, wretched refuse ended up on a different teeming shore.
working for this man, chief operating officer of First Defense PMC, Colonel Merton Bell.
bell's based out of Virginia. He's a former tank commander.
runs the largest PMC operating in the Middle East.
armed security forces protecting mostly corporate employers.
he also has governmental contracts, American and otherwise.
securing reconstruction projects.
bring him in. - Hold up a second.
you guys got a location on Mike Franks?
no. They don't.
Franks wasn't living alone on that beach.
he's been with a young woman for almost three years now.
his daughter-in-law, Leyla Shakarji.
and her daughter, Amira.
you telling me we can't find a fugitive on the run with an Iraqi woman and a child?
no. I'm saying we've kept our attention on the dead men.
and now you want to drag in Colonel Merton Bell.
and that's not all right with you. - No.
do I need to explain my problem?
I thought that you were going to give me some room on this.
I was, and I am.
but I know Colonel Bell. We have friends in common on the Hill.
then, this is about politics.
your approach lacks finesse. - Finesse.
you could show him the same courtesy I showed you when this case began.
you mean rub his nose in it?
you can go heavy if you want, but we're talking about the man with the largest private collection of legally obtained hardware in the United States.
he's got Blackhawks in his front yard.
are you worried I'm too blunt, Leon?
you are transparent. Two of his men are dead. You know who killed them.
I don't want Colonel Bell to get the impression that we're harboring a murderer.
why would he jump to that conclusion?
well, you don't appear to be devoting too much time in tracking down his killer.
if I were Bell, that might make me nervous.
hell, if I were me, that might make me nervous.
Mike Franks and his family are home.
and you were about to send your agents over there to keep an eye on them.
sure-- while I find a more delicate way to approach Colonel Bell.
that be anything you want to help me with, maybe?
it's like we were reading each other's minds.
Hello? - DiNozzo.
should have told me you were coming.
I called, and you didn't pick up.
not going to answer the phone-- I'm a fugitive.
so, what do you want me to do? - Knock.
why would I knock? There's no lock on that door.
someone may be on the other side with a gun.
why would somebody be standing on the other side with a gun?
because there's no lock on the door.
this has been very educational, gentlemen.
lady Ziva, glad you're here. Gibbs send you?
we have been instructed to sit on the baby.
going to be fine, Mike, and it's good to see you. Have a mint.
got your marching orders, too.
McGee is waiting outside to drive you to NCIS.
are you leaving?
you heard the man. It's going to be fine.
this is for the best.
why don't you put something in front of the door.
no, I'll just stand here with my gun.
that guy.
I'm back and forth to Iraq and Afghanistan so much, it's practically my office now, Leon.
thank you. - Sure.
Keenan and Blanchard were over there?
public interface, mainly.
we meet with the local tribal leaders on a weekly basis, get a sense of what's going on.
threats to look out for.
no, it's not all negative.
sometimes, the chatter is a little more innocuous.
people talk about a need to build a new school.
gives us an opportunity to combine our efforts.
increases our odds of success.
they were good at their jobs?
I'm sure I don't detect a note of surprise in your voice, Special Agent Gibbs.
all my men are outstanding.
united States Armed Forces disagrees.
my company may not adhere to the same-- so much punitive-- restrictions.
nevertheless, we seem to be picking up more and more of their responsibilities.
every time the U. S.reduces the number of troops deployed, you have to increase your hires.
Gibbs. - It's understandable, Director.
jarheads and mercs are like oil and water.
although, I've got some of my best men off the Marine Corps' scrap heap.
the men you hire have histories of violence, insubordination, mental problems.
what do you have to do to be disqualified?
if you intend to cast aspersions on the names of two dead men-- two of my men
I'd prefer you just cut to the chase and ask the real question.
okay. Did you know two of your men were in Mexico carrying weapons you furnished?
of course I did. They informed me when they accepted the contract.
they were carrying out a contract on Mike Franks?
who the hell is Mike Franks?
well, thank you for your cooperation, Colonel Bell.
I expect you'll keep me apprised, Director.
justice needs to be done here.
is that the bad guy?
Hey, probie, is that the guy that put the hit on me?
no one was after you. - What?
you were just the only lead they had.
- Leyla and Amira's family from Iraq.
they hired those two PMCs to find them.
and you killed 'em. You want to know who the real bad guy is here, Mike?
go look in the damn mirror.
you don't look very remorseful, Mike. - About what?
these two men were hired by your daughter-in-law's family to find her.
there's no reason to believe that they meant her or you any harm.
it appears... you killed them in cold blood.
I can't say how it went, Mike. I wasn't there.
Leyla first came over. two about her family.
they disowned her.
disowned her because she got pregnant by my son, Liam.
that's not family.
those two guys were doing Shada Shakarji's bidding.
don't expect me to cry for them.
Shada Shakarji is Leyla's family?
her mother.
Hard-as-nails matriarch of one of the most prominent tribes in Iraq.
it's unorthodox for a woman to be in that position of prominence.
didn't exactly run for the office.
Shada buried her father, her brothers and her husband in the war with Iran.
lost her oldest son to Saddam, and a couple of more since.
family was about out of men.
but not memory. She's a vindictive old sow.
and when Amty Shada cuts you off, you're not supposed to get a happily-ever-after on a beach in Mexico.
she's willing to pay to drag 'em back home?
she's not gonna flinch at a couple of dead guys for hire.
what did you use? - What?
what did you use? - .45
how many shots?
I used the boat as a decoy.
left the radio on the deck and an open beer.
they went for it with guns drawn.
emptied my mag from the porch, put two in the big guy and three in the other.
reloaded, dragged 'em onboard, and gave 'em each three more for good measure.
it was self-defense.
take his statement.
the evidence better confirm every bit of it.
Abby! Abby, what are you doing?
what are you doing? - He told me to do it.
I had to do it. But I'm trying to do it like an archaeologist.
I'm keeping careful notes of where everything came from, and I'm sure I can put it back together again when I'm done.
you're using a chainsaw!
well, it's not like there was a zipper, McGee.
I mean, I was hoping for a zipper, or some sort of system of-of dowels and slots.
well, please tell me it was worth it.
I found a secret stash box.
grease residue suggests that Franks kept a gun in there.
the guy keeps a gun everywhere.
took us 15 minutes to get through security.
Franks was smuggling a piece? Was it a 22?
no. It was a saw blade curled in the hollowed-out heel of his boot.
22? I don't think he carries anything that small.
I found this mangled piece of lead embedded deep in the floorboards.
I think it's two slugs smashed together. Like boom-boom.
one bullet hit another bullet? - Yeah.
it's an impossible shot.
Yeah, if they were both in the air at the same time.
it's a bullet in a bullet?
Abby's analyzing it now, but if it is a piece a . 22 in a .45
you broke up there. - What are you saying?
I can't hear you, McGee. I'm in the basement.
Why?
cause I don't want to talk about the case in front of Leyla and the kid.
listen, Tony, this is really important.
I need you to check the seams of the walls.
the walls? - Well, do they appear to be removable?
Abby. - Or-Or a tunnel maybe.
could be hidden underneath something on the floor.
something that looks like it doesn't belong.
actually, I think Colonel Hogan has got a radio in the coffee pot, but the tunnel might have been filled in.
I saw a video on the internet once where this guy
he built a Lamborghini in his basement
they had to pull off half the house to get it out.
was that a ding?
I think we've got another shooter.
you have very peaceful eyes, Amira. Do you know that?
Yes, she does.
I left Iraq because I didn't want to expose her to the violence I saw as a child.
I want that peace to last in her eyes forever.
you made difficult choices for both of you.
sometimes the most significant moments happen in your life without any choice at all.
like your father.
I knew the cost of even talking to Liam, but I couldn't help it.
the feeling was irresistible.
it was love at first sight.
maybe.
do you miss your homeland?
it was difficult to leave it all behind.
but the right reasons made it easier.
Ziva's trying to pick up and start over again.
Rebuild... again.
Yes.
what's your place like in Mexico?
it is simple.
just enough room for the three of us.
were you inside when the, uh...
when it started? - Yes.
what did you do?
I did what any mother would do.
I ran to my daughter.
where was she?
leyla, where was she?
Shada Shakarji has become one of the most outspoken voices of the Iraqi tribes during the past few years.
and she's suffered for it. Lots of enemies among the old guard.
I can tell you all of this. - Keep writing.
bombing last year.
killed 40, including her oldest son, believed to be the target.
increased security considerably since then.
that's where she came in contact with First Defense PMC.
and Colonel Bell.
Gibbs' desk. - It's Ducky.
Ducky for you. - I'm looking for Jethro. Is he around? It's rather important.
Yeah, Duck.
Oh, uh, would you come down please? - All right.
Ah, Jethro.
you know we have enormous respect for you, and for the loyalty that you exhibit towards your friends.
Gibbs, we love you very, very much.
what the hell is this?
this is an intervention.
your own history with Mike Franks is having a-a blinding effect on your skill as an investigator.
it's too much for any man to take. I mean...
I mean, he busted the gut. The guy's a gut-buster.
he's like a six-foot hero, like... Like, uh, like the sandwich, not...
he's not six foot, and he's-he's not a hero.
he's lying to us.
it's insulting enough when people that we don't know try this stuff.
but a colleague, I mean, a supposed friend-- it's...
well, it's-it's simply a betrayal.
.45 slug, 45 slug, . 45 slug, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
the pathways they took through the bodies
all of them straight downwards.
Yes, incredibly destructive.
we also found this. Partial . 22 slug. And there's more.
we believe that what happened was this.
somebody else shot them... with a rifle.
a . 22 long.
and then Franks shot through the gunshot wounds of the already-dead men to destroy the evidence.
Mike Franks did not kill these guys.
careful. I've been writing on this thing all day.
I was just about to sign it.
my second year, we caught a case, you and I.
a sergeant and his best friend took his little boy duck-hunting for the first time.
geese. They were chasing wild geese. - Yeah.
I know, Mike. You made that joke a few times.
you laughed each time.
well, I had to, I worked for you then.
not anymore.
that sergeant dragged his friend home that day missing half his chest.
dead. Bird shot everywhere.
shotgun blast, close range.
nothing accidental about it. But you wouldn't charge him.
it was accidental.
little boy's gun went off.
shot that guy right through the heart.
and I've been thinking about that a lot lately.
that sergeant standing over the body of his best friend.
his ten-year-old son's just killed him.
he's feeling like it's his fault.
like he failed them both.
only one thing left for him to do.
and that's to protect his son from what's coming next.
put his shotgun into the wound. And fires.
he's thinkin' he'll take the bullet himself.
this ain't going to work.
When'd you figure it?
boss? Boss, you wanted me to let you know if I found anything interesting about Shada Shakarji.
according to this flight information, she's on a commercial plane right now.
Grandms on her way to D. C.
I am Shada Shakarji.
car's right out front.
what is she doing here?
Oh, just taking a hands-on approach with her daughter.
her first attempt lacked in finesse.
how's the statement coming, Mike?
it was a load of crap.
probie called me on it. - You lied to us?
I'm sure you're shocked and appalled, Director.
I'm relieved.
of all your unsavory character traits, I find that one the most palatable.
at least there aren't anymore bodies.
there might be. If you turn her loose.
what are we going to hold her on, Mike? She hasn't committed a crime.
conspiracy to be a bitch?
it's one thing he told the truth about.
he is protecting his family.
well, I guess that's what this is. It's a family thing.
why don't you get in there and see if you can work it out with the in-laws.
you do still know your way around the room, don't you?
you know who I am.
the Greeks would call you Charon.
your boat conducts the dead to hell.
leaving a trail of misery in your wake.
Yeah, lady.
and you're all smiles and sunshine.
I've been tracking your every move since the day your accursed offspring ruined my daughter.
I have never hit a woman, but... - I find that hard to believe.
I'm finding it hard to believe you're actually a woman.
you manipulative, stubborn hag!
you hide my family from me.
you disowned them.
so?
things change.
I have lost too much family that I can never get back.
she is my child.
and the little girl is my granddaughter.
my blood.
you sent gunmen to abduct Leyla and Amira.
what were your intentions? To punish them?
to rescue. From you.
if there is a chance to reconcile, I am willing to...
travel the distance.
you put them in jeopardy.
it would never have turned violent-- I was assured of it
if not for you.
I got news for you, lady.
I didn't pull a gun on them.
I didn't fire the first shot.
shut up. I don't believe you.
I'm not proud to cop to this. I wasn't ready for them.
I didn't get tipped off. Hell, I never even heard them coming.
your... defenses were down?
we were up in the boat, she wanted to paint her name on the side.
then these two guys are standing there.
pointing guns up at me.
Leyla noticed 'em from the house.
my Leyla?
my meek, quiet, little girl?
unloaded six shots rapid-fire from a . 22 huntin' rifle. Five hits.
she knows to shoot?
I taught her.
never underestimate a mama bear when her cub's in danger.
that I believe.
they're safer with me than they are with you.
I can't let you pull them back into the fold.
what? What is it?
I made payment already.
Colonel Bell assures me th tontractll be completed.
she went up the ladder after the first guys failed. Directly to Bell.
guy's got nothing but his name.
he takes the hit if he takes a job, can't get it done.
with that chip on his shoulder, not even she can call him off.
got it, Gibbs. - Trouble brewing?
Where's Amira? - She's upstairs, sleeping.
all right.
take her downstairs. - Whoa, whoa, wait. You know how to shoot?
Yes, she does.
Tony! - Look out!
go, go! Get down on the floor!
hands where I can see 'em!
get eyes on... - Stay down! Don't move!
keep looking at the floor!
we're secure. Ziva? Is that you?
Damon? - Wait a second, you know this guy?
corporal Damon Werth. USMC. Dishonorably discharged.
Oh, yeah. - Give me your hands!
what are you doing here? - This is Gibbs' living room.
what are you doing here?
rescuing a kidnapped little girl and her mother.
I'm sorry to tell you, but you're actually abducting them.
Hey, Werth. Cut the chitchat, just secure the prisoner.
I can't. We're making a mistake.
bell's got a lotta money riding on this job.
we're gonna finish it with or without...
I think we should hear them out. Don't you?
you get the girls, Corporal? You finish the job?
Yeah, I'm finished with the job, sir.
what have you done, son? - I quit.
and that a shame, because
somebody's going to have to clean that up.
you want to go punch for punch with me, Gibbs?
keep in mind, I got a big arsenal behind me.
I wouldn't worry, your suit covers it up very nicely.
sorry, I'm a little wacky, 'cause of the flash-bang your boys threw at us.
perhaps my men were overexuberant in the pursuit of their task.
personally, however, I have not broken any laws.
u. S.laws. But the Federales want to talk to you.
Yeah, turns out bounty hunting is illegal south of the border.
God Bless Mexico.
I tell my men, you take a swing, make sure you connect hard enough to put the other guy down.
good advice. Put your hands behind your back.
should also tell 'em to get a haircut.
you, um, think the grandparents can work this out?
my dad told me a story once, oh, dates back maybe 30 years after the Civil War.
my great-great-grandmother and grandfather had fathers that fought on either side.
these two old warriors, they probably shot at each other on the battlefield.
they couldn't even look at each other at their own kids' wedding.
but they did come to live with each other in the same house.
and they spent every day for the rest of their lives on the front por, in a couple of wicker rocking chairs rocking back and forth.
well, here's hoping.
we got better things to do than be the Frank's family counselor.
Yeah.
I guess they worked out their differences?
your relatives? They mellowed with time, right?
way I heard it, those two never said a word.
you can't catch me!
you're not getting away!
give up, I got you! -- Do not!
you're done. --Am not!
here I come!
Tag-- you're it!
what's that?
it's a scarecrow, stupid. Now, come on, you're it.
wait, that.
let's just get out of here.
run, run!
you're not taking the elevator.
Nope, took the stairs. It's all about the cardio these days.
you have been looking increasingly Kate moss-ish there, Mctim.
what are you down-- two, three pounds?
15 pounds, actually, and thank you for noticing.
well, that's what I do for a living.
eagle-eyed special agent.
girl? -- No girl.
come on, McGee. Nobody gives up the pizza and the donuts without a good reason.
all right, you want the truth? I usually gain a few pounds during the holidays,
so, this year, I thought I would counter it.
well, you can resume Your diet after thanksgiving, Timothy.
the traditional mallard table Is not for anyone whose body isn't into Bountiful good cheer.
a thanksgiving supper at Mallard Manor. All the fixin's.
uh, Ducky, thanksgiving is in two days.
Yeah, well, I-I'm aware of that.
I already have plans-- I'm gonna see my sister.
well, bring her with you.
I also have accepted an invitation for thanksgiving-- uh, a neighbor.
Oh, dear, and Mr. Palmer is already out of town.
Ducky, I-I also have plans.
are you letting some blonde bombshell baste your bird, Tony?
no, this bird's flying solo to a poker tournament at the big bend Indian casino.
they've got an all-you-can-eat crab buffet.
pilgrims and indians gambling together-- That warms the heart.
what about your mother, Ducky?
mother is comfortable, thank you.
the staff take good care of her. Poor dear.
she barely recognizes me when I visit.
well, then, That leaves me with a 20-pound bird and enough trimmings to feed coxey's army.
not army... Marines. Got a dead one in a cornfield.
what, duck, you waiting for an invitation?
Oh, yes, uh, here's yours. Thanksgiving.
Ah, here's yours. Cornfield. Let's go!
maybe I'm amazed. A maze of maize.
what?
Maize-- it's the Indian word for corn.
the Indian word for corn is makki.
not Indians from India, Indians from, you know, here.
well, if they were Indians from here, They would be called american Indians, you dork.
no, they'd be called native Americans, Miss citizenship test.
DiNozzo, process this.
Gibbs... Several sets of footprints, some of them very small.
a couple kids found him.
these aren't kids' footprints.
over here, those are big ones. Come from that direction.
drag marks, which means that when they pulled our marine, He was dead already.
Ah, fresh corn. That gives me an idea.
why don't we have corn chowder as our first course?
poker. -- Sister.
neighbors.
later.
based on the viscosity of the blood...
I'd say this is a recent demise.
my instinct tells me he was not shot here.
this is marine lance corporal Trevor Lozada, stationed out of Quantico, boss.
the corporal is missing a hand.
he was killed prior to it being removed.
otherwise the blood pooling would be much greater.
maybe the crows carried it off. Caw, caw!
sorry, I had to do it.
sorry, boss.
time of death-- Eight to ten hours ago, between 3: 00 and 5: 00.
PCS-- Local gang, big up and down the east coast, boss.
of course, you already know that.
maybe this is some sort of initiation thing, you know?
kill a marine and you're in, no questions asked.
lance corporal Lozada was a gang member before he joined the marines.
his tat was lasered off.
why would somebody shoot him, bring him out here, carve him up, and cut off his hand?
Ziva, get on Dinozzo's shoulders. -- Boss?
I would rather not.
bend over, Tony. -- Boss...
come on, Tony, use those quads.
Oh, god, boss.
west.
turn this way. -- Okay.
police cars. -- North.
a farmer on a tractor. -- East.
barn... 200 yards away.
I got a cramp in my neck. I got a cramp.
I don't think they meant to hide him.
I mean, this place is not exactly isolated.
so, whoever put this body here... -- Wanted him found.
marine lance corporal Trevor Lozada had a spotless service record, multiple tours.
rewarded with a very desirable duty post guarding the sattler institute for strategic studies and analysis.
R & D, government think tank.
naval war college and marine intel units use them.
lance corporal Lozada had been there about six months.
I'm gonna call the Sattler Institute, let them know we're heading over.
current address on Lozada.
McGee, you and ziva check out lozada.
DiNozzo, you're with me. - Sattler Institute?
Ooh, boss, shouldn't mcsmarty-pants go to the nerd theme park?
I mean, it's got to be a nerd's paradise with the world of warcraft wallpaper and the pocket protectors and the elfin-shaped beds.
cause I probably shouldn't... I'll get the car.
NCIS. Special Agents Gibbs and Dinozzo.
Yes, I'm Krista Dalton, facilities coordinator.
I spoke with someone on the phone.
something happened to lance corporal Lozada?
he was found dead this morning about 20 miles from here.
Oh, my god. How did it happen?
not very nicely, Krista.
what did lance corporal Lozada guard around here?
I'll show you. Here.
this way.
he guarded a day care center?
this isn't a day care. This is our intelligence testing center.
you test the intelligence of these kids?
no, they test ours.
Hey, Parker, how's it going?
Parker's specialty is the redeployment of rapid response groups.
I thought we had people at the pentagon who do that.
we do. But we've found that gifted children have a less linear, less bureaucratic way of approaching things,
simpler, cleaner, purer.
where are their parents?
we have an arrangement with the families.
the kids visit us for a week or two at a time.
helps maintain a nice balance between home and here and keep the kids focused.
I guess it's fun.
well, these are just puzzles and games to them.
so you're telling me lance corporal Lozada was a babysitter, basically.
well, a bodyguard.
these kids are incredibly valuable to us and the military.
Hey, uh, when do I get my MP3 player back?
when you stop wrapping the cord around the ceiling fan, Brett.
I was testing my aerodynamic theory of glide ratio versus Inverted torque.
what are you looking at? -- Val Kilmer, real genius.
Brett, you like to break things, which is why you wrapped the cord around the ceiling fan.
you will get your MP3 player back after thanksgiving.
okay, whatever.
Brett's one of our prized students as well as one of the oldest.
Yeah, he's a real smarty-pants. Lucky you.
any of these kids personally close to Lozada?
one-- Angela Kelp.
angela had been acting distracted lately,
so I asked lance corporal Lozada to keep an eye on her.
they hit it off.
she around here somewhere? -- Yes, this way.
sorry, boss.
get us out of here! Drive!
I'm ready, Mr. Norvell. -- What do you see?
mistakes.
would you care to elaborate? -- First, the sun.
it's almost 30 degrees, directly into our troops' eyes,
blinding them while concealing the bad guys on the rooftop.
go on.
they should never have been in an open, exposed area like this plaza.
it gives the enemy gunners a clear, unobstructed angle of fire.
yeah... But they were headed to rescue a unit under attack.
Yes. That's why they took the most direct route.
what they should have done was taken a less direct route on narrower streets with more vertical protection, taller buildings.
would have saved a lot of lives.
impressive.
the art, I mean.
Thanks. That's my cat back home.
what's its name?
Kimba. Lives with me and my mom.
what about dad?
split when I was little.
Kimba's good at taking out Taliban.
you should see what she does to mice.
agent Gibbs, NCIS, This is Gregg Norvell, our director of youth programs.
whatever you need, don't hesitate to ask. -- Thanks.
something happened, didn't it? -- What do you mean?
to lance corporal Lozada.
something happened to him, right?
is there someplace the two of us could go talk?
Yeah, your room.
if you'd like to follow us...
I had a combined S.A.T. score of 950. Is that good?
do you want a cupcake? I made them.
Thanks.
so, what makes you think something happened to lance corporal Lozada?
well, you're here, he's not.
you want to talk to me because trevor and I were friends, right?
did somebody... kill him?
why would you ask that?
because people emote more sympathy when it's an accident.
you're searching. Curious.
do you know that a marine returning home from active duty has a 38% greater chance of being hurt or killed than when he's deployed?
did you make these?
they're good. -- Thanks.
Krista says it's important for me to express myself.
Yeah, I think she's right.
just like it's important That, if you know anything about Trevor, you should call me.
Yeah. Gibbs.
where?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Thanks.
Leos matched the car's registration to Lozada.
what's the distance from the crime scene?
about, uh, six miles.
didn't find anything in his apartment, but you were right.
he was a member of a local gang-- PCS.
look at that.
there's one of the slugs we didn't find in the lance corporal.
I patched into his onboard map set program.
this was his route to and from Sattler Institute every day.
and based on the time of death, Lozada must have just left work.
someone nicked the fuel line. Clean cut.
followed him till his tank ran dry, pulled up and ambushed him?
took him to the cornfield.
Hey, Dinozzo.
Yep, it's Lozada's. Six incoming calls.
all listed to the same number. Billed to the same address.
go. Find our missing caller.
got it. On it.
so, you brought me in here for making phone calls to a friend?
no, Eddie, because you and lance corporal Lozada were eses.
the file here says that, uh, he broke off his gang ties years ago.
clearly, you haven't.
we had our disagreements, but me and trev were like brothers.
brothers? Really?
metro gang division says that, uh, You tried to kill your brother a few years ago, - when he left the PCS. -- No.
people felt betrayed, but we worked it out.
you worked it out.
that doesn't smell so good to me.
call me jaded. Lozada took an oath. He broke it.
it pissed you off. Admit it.
if I wanted to kill him back then, I would have.
look, me and Trevor grew up together, and he burned me, so...
so, it's a grudge. -- No, we just had some unsettled business.
like what? -- Like you don't need to know about.
Eddie... You are a real cool customer, aren't you?
got to give you a hand.
speaking of hands...
why'd you cut Trevor's off? Carve "PC" into his arm?
that's a nice touch, Zorro.
it's kind of like putting up a billboard that says,"don't mess with the PCS and Eddie Castillo-- he's not afraid of anyone, Including the marines."
I didn't do that.
you got an alibi for last night?
lullaby. -- Alibi.
it's an after-hours club for rich kids.
we handle the... Refreshments there.
Really? Well, we'll see about that.
in the meantime, I hope you like being swabbed, poked and pricked.
Why?
cause we're checking you for gunshot residue, blood and dirt from the crime scene.
anything I can think of. You know why?
cause you're messing with my holidays.
and I don't like it when people mess with my thanksgiving.
boss, you're going to want to see this.
according to security sensors,
lance corporal Lozada entered the dorm wing this morning at 6: 00 a.m.
that is impossible. He was dead.
exactly.
dorm access requires a palm scan, boss.
well, that clears up one mystery. Someone needed his hand.
Yeah, but here's the strange part.
that's Angela's room. They take anything?
no. Figure walked out less than a minute later.
all he or she was carrying Was Lozada's hand.
all they did was visit Angela's room. Then they left.
empty-handed.
so, Angela, you didn't see anybody in your room this morning?
no... But I was asleep.
nothing missing?
two of my collages are gone.
yeah? Anything special about them?
just collages. Stuff, art.
Hey, would you mind if I borrowed this?
okay. So, you know that your mom knows you're coming with us and that you're safe, right?
sure you didn't see anything?
positive. -- Okay. Let's go.
Hey, Abby.
hang on a minute, Gibbs. This is important.
it's my great aunt's cranberry sauce recipe.
I lost it, so I'm trying to duplicate it before Ducky's thanksgiving dinner.
I don't want to let Ducky's turkey down, you know?
Abby... Today.
what can I do for you, Gibblet? It's kind of a seasonal play on your...
I'm ready, sir. -- Turn this into pictures.
thought you were going to give me something hard.
so what are you bringing to Ducky's dinner?
not sure I'm going. -- What do you mean, you're not going?
who's going to carve the turkey?
who's going to watch the game with me?
who's going to eat too much pie?
Abby... The photos.
what am I looking for?
girl's room. Panning shot.
Oh, she listens to His Orange. What a cool little chick.
this is how geeks recreate. Exhibit A.
she's so cute.
all right, stop it there.
okay, blow up that one and that one.
those are cool. What are they?
that's what you're gonna tell me.
well, what am I looking for?
I have... Absolutely no idea.
so it is hard.
more sugar.
Jethro. You know that little bakery near you?
I'd appreciate it if you could bring a dozen of their dinner rolls.
got a confirmation of death, Duck?
Oh, gunshot wound to the head.
well, what I presume Is the kill shot entered his head here,
just behind his right ear, traveled in an upward direction.
I was just about to find out what damage it caused.
before he was posted? -- Oh, yes.
clearly, the killer's intention was to leave some sort of macabre message.
Yeah, and not too shy about indicating who was sending it.
easy autograph to forge.
duck, I need a psych evaluation on a 12-year-old girl.
where do you go, jethro? -- What?
over the past nine thanksgivings, I've called your house. You're never home.
sometimes I even drive by.
so, I shall expect you promptly 16:00 hours.
Oh, that reminds me-- I mustn't go home without him.
avoid sourdough rolls if you can.
their flavor clashes with my salad dressing.
white bread is okay, but whole wheat would be preferable.
Oh, dear.
Thanks.
can I get you something to drink, Mrs. Mckinna?
you remembered, Agent Gibbs.
well, you're memorable, D'arcy.
holiday plans, Mrs. Mckinna?
I'm sending a shopping list to my husband, as we speak.
are you cooking for the family? -- That's the plan.
why do I need a legal youth advocate here?
it's the law, sweetie.
so, have you ever killed anybody?
me?
no.
okay, I will bring her up. Mrs. Mckinna?
Oh, you go on ahead, Ziva. I'll be right there.
I got all my bars, and I'm only up to celery stalks.
Gibbs. Ducky's waiting.
Yeah. I'll take her up. -- Okay.
Bye.
you take the stairs up, but the elevator down?
knees.
okay. Got my attention.
you think I'm hiding something. About Trevor.
are you?
I told you. You're safe here.
I know. That's not it.
I'm not in danger.
who is?
nobody.
glad we talked.
Hello, I'm Dr. Mallard. Please.
and if you wish, you can call me ducky.
Hello, Ducky.
Dr. Mallard, you may proceed.
I'm here if you need me, Angela.
well, now, Angela. -- Is this a psych evaluation?
I know there are three types: General, emergency and clinical.
this feels clinical to me.
Ah, Jethro. I was just coming to see you.
you all right, Duck?
Yeah, well, she had me talking about my first pet.
it was a guinea pig called hunka munka.
passed away, ooh, about the time I was her age.
duck, you were supposed to find out about her past.
Yeah, well, all that went extremely well. -- And?
well, if she is suppressing memories, she does a remarkably good job of it.
I didn't get anywhere there.
but I can tell you that beneath that precocious bravado there is a very sensitive little girl.
she may act twice her age but inside she's anything but.
secrets? -- Yeah, and when she's ready, she will reveal them.
but I wouldn't push her.
Jethro, when I did just now, she pushed right back.
Hey, boss, here you go.
Eddie Castillo's here again. -- Well, go talk to him.
me? -- Yeah, you got something better to do, Dinozzo?
well, yeah, I got travel plans. -- No, go, talk.
right.
Hey, miss me, Eddie?
look, I've got something to say. It's about why I was calling Trevor.
I'm all ears.
I have a cousin. He's nine years old;
he's already getting into trouble and I wanted to have Trevor talk to him,
uh, about that marines stuff-- help straighten him out.
give him somebody to look up to.
other than you? That warms my heart.
I'm serious, man.
I can't let my crew find out that I'm trying to keep my own blood out of this life.
Yeah, it's all about honor and integrity with you, isn't it, Eddie?
you don't know anything about me, man!
I know plenty about you!
I know you're not angry at Lozada, you're jealous of him.
cause he had the brains and the guts to get out of the gang. And you didn't.
and he made something of himself, you didn't.
Trevor got out 'cause he had a real job and he could take care of his family.
they were proud of him, you know.
he earned that. But I didn't kill him!
look, he needed something from me, too, okay?
he needed some advice.
something about some girl in trouble.
you're telling me that a decorated marine calls you instead of the cops?
he said if he went to the cops then the girl's life would be in danger.
I don't know why.
girl have a name? -- Angela.
sorry, my cousin Tetra's lime jello with yams, marshmallows and pecans.
some family traditions should not be upheld.
that really, really, really sucked.
in a jiffy, Gibbs. Did you know that "Jiffy" is one one-hundredths of a second?
I mean, it's an actual thing.
unlike say, lickety-Split, which has no scientific meaning whatsoever.
all right, we're almost there. -- Get there, Abbs, in a jiffy.
there, okay. I applied a biometric algorithm recognition program
so the seemingly random artistic patterns of her...
you don't really care how I got there.
okay, let's talk turkey.
a code.
it's more than a code, Gibbs. It's her own language.
she used 26 shades of color to correspond with the 26 letters of the alphabet.
once I figured that out, I was able to translate her art into letters.
a poem? -- Yeah.
and it's dark and creepy. Very detailed.
it's called,"the lady in a fountain.
it's about death. --It's a poem.
can you just ask me about the second collage? Please, please, please, please.
Abby, what am I looking at here?
it's a frequency-jamming signal, Gibbs.
frequency? For what?
it's every communication code for every ship, plane and helicopter in the United States navy and marine corps.
I don't know why she was hiding military secrets in her collages, unless...
I don't know, she was gonna sell them?
or someone else was for her.
bank records for angela's mother.
Gibbs, Angela's mom has called 13 times.
she wants to see her daughter. - Yeah, she will. What'd you find, Mcgee?
Angela's mom's average income for the past 16 years is $43, 000.
okay, more recently.
over the last three months, Her mother's made three additional deposits totaling 60 grand.
so, either her mother's playing the ponies...
or she's taking advantage of her little girl.
it's like those magic eye posters, Where you stare at them and then, suddenly, you see that hidden image.
Tony, abby already un-hid it.
it's frequency-jamming signals.
no, maybe if I... Maybe if I try to unfocus...
focus, Dinozzo. -- That's it, boss.
out of focus. It's dolphins! In moonlight!
thank you, boss. -- Anytime.
McGee. Anytime.
boss, the, uh, frequency-jamming signals Abby pulled out of angela's collages are linked to a naval/marine maneuver called ballistic winter.
copies of these jamming signals appeared on the black market three months ago in China.
it's an open NCIS investigation.
there is no way that girl stole state secrets. She is a child.
you've clearly never seen the bad seed.
Interpol have suspects?
just one.
just follow along here, boss.
C-ten dynamics is a U.S.Defense firm that does r and d in conjunction with the Sattler Institute.
C-ten's sales rep is a woman named Debra Leigh Dalton.
Dalton. Same last name as our think tank coordinator, Krista Dalton.
sisters? -- Affirmative.
Debra is Krista's younger sister.
maybe that was Debra sneaking into Angela's room?
I want to talk to Debra dalton.
uh, boss, that's gonna be a bit of a problem.
miss Dalton flew into D.C five days ago but never got to her house.
and there's no record of any credit card or cell activity since she arrived.
a mom, a daughter and two sisters trading government secrets.
it's like Hannah and her sisters meets the 39 steps. Sorry.
get Krista Dalton in here.
put Angela in a safehouse.
safe houses have been compromised-- a computer glitch.
should be cleared by tomorrow. Motel?
good luck finding one right before thanksgiving.
Ducky has an extra room.
you know, boss, we've all got plans this holiday season and...
cancel them.
play again?
this kid's a ringer. Watch her.
I know that, Ray.
Hey, that's my money.
so, what's the buy-in?
for you? Two bucks.
okay, how about we play for different stakes?
what do you have in mind?
I win, you tell me the truth.
about Lozada, military secrets, everything.
found the jamming signals that were hidden in your artwork.
I wasn't hiding anything.
it's just how my mind works.
it's how I work out puzzles they give me.
I do it through art, images.
numbers, letters, colors and shapes.
you build things.
woodwork, right?
my father made cabinets.
didn't you ever express yourself in the things you made?
how many people at the institute know what was in your artwork?
I'm not sure.
safe house is ready.
what is going on here, Agent Gibbs?
why is NCIS holding my daughter?
you've been getting a lot of money lately.
no, no, that is Angela's money.
look, I never wanted her to go there.
what mother wants to be without her child?
but Angela thought that it would be good for her.
she wanted to fit in somewhere.
you really thought she was getting paid all that just to play video games?
we were told Angela's work saved soldiers' lives.
the money didn't matter. She felt good about helping.
it all goes to her college fund.
what are you suggesting? -- How'd the dollars get to you?
the larger amounts came from this company, C-ten Dynamics.
I assumed they were projects angela worked on.
payments were approved by Debra Dalton. You know her?
no, I only ever talked to Krista Dalton.
the checks come in the mail.
Yeah. Gibbs.
where? All right.
wait, when can I see my daughter?
soon.
a maintenance worker from the sattler institute found the body.
that'll spoil your thanksgiving.
Debra Dalton, boss.
fished her out of the culvert.
whoever put her down there must've thought that the body would wash away.
it's a pretty public place for a murder.
I mean, employees, security guards...
dorms. Angela's room.
lady in a fountain.
can I help? -- Uh, I don't think so. Thank you.
can I watch TV?
uh, it's on the blink, I'm afraid.
computer?
uh, that's my laptop, and it's in my car.
books? -- Ah, yes. Uh, the library.
uh, second door on the left.
Oh, just a moment, Ziva. We have to start the brining.
okay, Ducky, but I have to... -- No, no, no, no. It'll only take a moment.
Ah, there we are. Now, then.
you know the secret to a good stuffing Is not to get it too moist.
Oh, this is a bit awkward.
you know something? I think we need a second pair of hands.
uh, uh, young lady?
Angela, where are you?
she isn't in the library and she didn't go out back.
Ziva, Ziva, have you found her?
she's gone. Call Gibbs.
agents are canvassing the neighbors.
amber alert. Bolos? -- No hits yet.
traffic cameras.
D.O.T.'s are on full capacity for the holidays, but checking.
I looked everywhere. Nothing.
nothing? You didn't hear anything? Not car tires? Not voices?
nothing. By the time I came outside, she was gone.
it was all my fault. I was too busy preparing for tomorrow.
no, it was my fault.
I distracted you from doing your job.
it's both of your faults. Focus on fixing it.
Yeah. Mcgee. I'll tell him.
Krista Dalton's in interrogation.
you stay with Ducky. You two, with me. Come on.
are you accusing me of taking her?
the care and safety of those kids is my only concern.
I can see why. Worth a lot to you.
we did some digging, and we found your overseas accounts.
it's... It's not what you think.
what am I thinking?
because it sure looks Like you made money selling government secrets, using these kids.
they're games. -- Games?
we sold battle scenarios to game designers. In china.
they paid a lot.
you and your sister Debra.
Yes. Debra made contacts through her trips to Asia for her firm.
C-ten Dynamics.
we took some of the money-- Debra and I-- The rest we gave to the families.
Sattler made a ton off those kids, never give anything back.
it was old information. Useless!
frequency jamming signals?
for "Ballistic Winter"-- that system was being phased out.
it's still classified. -- Technically, but...
which makes it technically treason.
someone murdered lance corporal Lozada, and you're talking to me about game sales?
I-I had nothing to do with his death!
Oh, my god.
that's... That's Debra.
how did this... When did this happen?
found her today. Your day off.
two dead bodies. Both tied to you and the institute.
you think... I killed my own sister?
maybe to bury the trail. Maybe to keep the money.
Oh, my god.
angela is missing.
what does this dead marine and your dead sister have to do with her?
I don't know. -- Think!
I swear! I...
Debra was seeing someone.
she was afraid of him. She was going to break it off...
who? Give me a name.
she never told me. She didn't want me involved.
you are involved!
DiNozzo. -- No sightings, boss.
whoever's got her is keeping her out of sight.
if anyone has seen her.
I just borrowed these from Abby. -- I'm listening, Duck.
well, apart from the cat-- Everything in her room is from the outside world:
the posters she's chosen, the photographs, The things she painted, the things she's drawn.
Yeah, there's nothing of herself.
it's as if she's resisting showing the rest of the world what she really cares about.
and when we talked, she never once mentioned her home or the town from whence she came.
she was guarding it. -- Yeah.
well, deep down I think she's just a scared little girl trying to protect her mother.
I've been calling her mother's house every ten minutes, like you said, but no answer.
I just got a credit card hit.
one of Ducky's credit cards.
what? She took one of mine? Clever girl.
just bought a map of her hometown at a service station.
she's dropping bread crumbs. -- Wants us to come get her.
if the killer is thinking the same way we are...
he'll be waiting for her. Let's go.
nice acceleration, boss.
I don't think that clam chowder was any good. I...
I haven't felt this way since aunt lorraine's thanksgiving, back in '86.
Yeah, Abbs. - Gibbs. Ducky said you were looking for a connection
between lance corporal Lozada and the woman found in the culvert.
talk faster, Abbs. You're breaking up. -- Okay.
I found traces of beeswax and bleached linseed oil on both lance corporal Lozada's body
and on a thumb impression on the back of debra Dalton's head.
it's like she was held down and drowned.
we matched the water in her lungs to the fountain in front of the think tank building.
exact chlorine and alkali levels.
both the oil and the wax are used as base ingredients in oil-based paints.
Thanks, Abbs.
uh, nausea sort of comes in waves, boss. But I'm working through it.
the paintings at norvell's workstation at the institute.
they oil- or water-based? -- Oil.
uh, landscape, fruit bowls...
Oh, I really shouldn't have had that clam chowder.
I'll take the back. -- Hang on.
mom! Mom!
baby, run. Run, please.
it's going to be okay, mom.
why are you doing this to us?
tell her, Angela.
tell her what you told lance corporal Lozada.
what you wrote in your collages!
Angela, go, please. Just let her go! --- Shut up!
why'd you kill that woman?
she humiliated me.
it had to be done.
same thing with Lozada... Once you told him. - No! No!
I think they bought the whole gang retribution thing. Don't you?
time to take a little ride. Let's go.
move!
let her go.
back off!
I'll kill her!
Angela... Look at me.
move back! Now!
got it. - She'll miss.
what's the probability of that?
based on the temperature and humidity.
no wind. Half moon, good light. 97.6%.
last chance, Norvell.
move or I'll do it! - Take it.
mom... -- Oh, baby.
Oh, baby. It's okay.
love you.
it's okay...
it is such a pleasure to have you all here.
even though our togetherness was not your first choice.
Ah, it's just Indian poker, all-you-can-eat crab legs, showgirls.
relax, Tony. Plenty of wine.
well, then...
I suppose it's time to carve.
and, apparently, we have a quorum.
you remembered the rolls!
there's not a lot available out there, Duck.
a superb selection.
a toast.
close friends and dear family all.
a bountiful thanks and good things for fall.
and to all a good night!
wrong holiday.
Cheers. -- To all of us!
happy thanksgiving. -- Jolly good!
Oh, come on. It's one little Christmas tree.
why pay when we can just cut it down?
because this is a park.
it's Christmas. -- It's illegal.
it's what our grandparents used to do.
Hey, Lara. -- What?
I like this whole criminal sexy thing.
stop it! -- So what's it gonna be this Christmas, huh?
a little naughty or nice?
Dean, wait! Wait!
wait. -- What?
Oh, my gosh. -- What's he doing?
Hey, mister. You all right?
must be freezing.
sir?
sir?
call the police.
merry Christmas, everybody!
Loretta, thanks for the ride.
Bye-bye. Have a good time. -- You drive careful now.
Hey, Dad. I didn't expect you till tonight.
well, I like my pilots caffeinated and fresh.
I caught an earlier flight.
Yeah, but you should have called. I would have picked you up.
no matter. I made it.
Yeah, you did.
too many years since I was here last.
Yeah. Whose fault is that, huh?
we gonna do this again, son?
come on in.
old place looks pretty good.
Yeah, well, it could use a coat of paint.
couldn't we all?
well, look at this.
hope you didn't get all decked out on my account.
plenty of comfortable hotels nearby.
I'll be fine just as long as I have a working clicker.
there's the clicker.
no cable. -- Color?
I'll manage.
okay, that's your bed.
what happened to the guest room?
it's not a guestroom anymore.
the, uh, the cupboard's not totally empty.
maybe I'll cook us something.
as long as it's not your stroganoff, knock yourself out.
what's wrong with my stroganoff?
I'm still surprised you came, Dad.
it's good to be with family at Christmas.
Yeah. You gonna be okay here alone?
I'll be fine, yeah. You go to work.
death doesn't take a holiday. I'll be fine.
okay. Leave my number right here by the phone.
you need anything, Ericson family two doors down same side of the street, they're always home.
I'm glad to be here.
it's freezing this morning.
man up, chilly willy.
feel that warm blood coursing through your veins.
get in touch with your inner McGrizzly Adams.
I got hand warmers. -- Give me one.
no. -- I'm not cold at all.
that's because you're cold-blooded, David, like a lady Komodo dragon.
ice Queen, frigid and deadly.
and I remembered to wear my thermal underwear.
I'll give you 50 bucks for it right now.
it wouldn't fit. You're too big.
they'll stretch. Hand them over.
crime scene gloves. Triple bag for insulation.
God, there's got to be a better way to avoid frostbite.
there is. Get to work. -- Right. On it, boss.
marine First Lieutenant Thomas Ellis.
married, decorated, third generation marine.
father's a retired marine colonel, George Ellis, who is now an ordained minister.
second career. --Second calling.
well, his son experienced the call of the wild.
going barefoot and without gloves in this weather is ill-conceived, to say the least.
was not a robbery. Money and credit cards are still here.
not much in the backpack except for a towel and what I think is some soapy water.
frozen soap residue under his fingernails confirms your discovery.
it's an odd place to take a bath.
could have at least turned around, enjoy the view.
Yeah, if he had, it might have saved his life.
recent footprints here indicate the attacker came from this direction.
used a compass. It's facing east.
why would a marine not even attempt to fight back?
lift him up, Duck.
look under his knees.
agent McGee, if you would be so kind.
it is called a sajada. An Islamic prayer rug.
well, son of a preacher man was... Muslim.
he was praying when he was killed.
as a marine, Ellis officially changed his religious status eight months ago from Christian to Muslim.
that was clearly not just a passing interest.
fruit of the Month might be good.
maybe a foot massager.
gee, Tony, never pegged you as a catalog shopper.
well, that's 'cause I'm not, Tiny Tim, but desperate times call for desperate measures.
I took these from my neighbor's doorstep.
you stole them?
Doorstep's considered a common area.
I would never steal mail. That's a federal offense.
Ooh, hold the phone, Malone.
little bit of lingerie. Nice.
what do you get for the shrew who has everything?
is this for the, um, Secret Santa?
how did I end up with Delores Bromstead in Human Resources?
she's a miserable Grinch of a woman.
can't argue with you there.
once wished her a happy Valentine's Day, she claimed sexual harassment.
you ever seen her smile? -- No.
stop it, both of you. She is a single, middle-aged, lonely woman.
have some compassion.
must be tough living up there on Mount Crumpit.
scheming to take Christmas away from poor Cindy Lou Who.
why do I bother?
careful, or I'll take your present back.
we have a rule, remember? No presents.
but if I had gotten you one, you'd be sorry.
DiNozzo desk. -- DiNozzo!
Hey, boss. -- You know where the Ellises live?
no-no. -- Find out.
Yes. -- Get there.
I'll meet you there. -- Now.
right away.
Yeah, he wants me to meet him over at Colonel Ellis's house.
don't touch my catalogs.
don't know yet. It's a possibility.
how long were you and the lieutenant married, Mrs. Ellis?
uh, two years. Thom had just gotten back from his second tour, so we hadn't really spent any real time together.
nothing tests a marriage like the Corps.
nature of the beast.
I forgot you were a marine, Agent Gibbs.
I remember you, Colonel.
it's Reverend now. -- Why the change?
when my wife died, I wanted to be closer to God.
now he's taken my son, as well.
if you don't mind my asking, Mrs. Ellis, when did you and Thom meet?
college here in Maryland.
um, he swam, and I played softball.
after he joined the Corps, things changed.
he, uh...He started studying the Koran, and he said it would make him a better marine.
within the first year, though, he was...
he was reciting prayers, and he was thinking about converting.
I blame myself for this.
did I push my beliefs on Thomas?
was all this Islamic study just to spite me?
I asked a friend of mine, a Muslim navy chaplain, to reach out to him.
maybe he can make some sense of all this.
merry Christmas, everyone.
this is my younger son, Patrick.
what-what happened? What's wrong?
thomas is dead, Pat.
your brother's gone. Come here.
lieutenant, when you knelt to commune with your maker, did you have any idea you'd be seeing him so soon?
I think not.
is it true that Muslims pray five times a day?
to be called Muslim, yes.
it is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.
I don't do anything five times a day.
Salat, as it is called, certainly takes dedication.
Yeah, perhaps if humanity focused less on what separates us from one other, and more on what we could learn from our differences, we would stop killing one another.
that is what I pray for.
you're not the only one, Duck. What do you got?
well, I'm waiting for the cleric until I begin the autopsy proper, but cursory examination indicates blunt force trauma to the parietal lobe, and multiple lacerations to his shoulders and neck.
it's deep. -- Yeah, and oddly angled.
the blow was delivered in a downward slicing motion.
delivered with what?
Ah, good question. Whatever it was was cylindrical.
we found paint residue and some kind of thread in the wound.
Yeah, well, we'll have to wait until Abby is done with her analysis.
however, there is still much to surmise.
the lieutenant has minor scratches on the soles of his feet.
and due to soap traces on his lower appendages, it appears that Lieutenant Ellis cleansed his feet again before returning to prayer.
which means he most likely knew his attacker.
trusted 'em enough to turn his back on them, Duck.
and paid for that misplaced trust with his life.
these chocolates are delicious!
Hey, Dad. Stop making my team fat. -- I love chocolate.
I'd really like another one.
Gibbs, why didn't you tell us your father was coming?
I didn't think he'd actually show.
go ahead. Have another one, bubble butt.
my metabolism is slowing with age.
it's nothing a post-holiday cleanse won't cure.
come on, it's just candy for the holidays.
homemade. Best in Stillwater.
ms. Hannigan, huh?
she's been after you ever since Mom died.
she means well.
been cooking for me lately.
she does put together a hell of a care package when people are hurting.
our instincts were right, boss.
the widow did have a fling while the lieutenant was overseas with a banker named James Hanlin, - from Chevy Chase, Maryland. - Any recent contact?
uh, not that I can tell. Called it off when the husband found out.
Assalamu alikum. -- Wa alikum assalam.
I'm Chaplain El-Sayed. I'm looking for Special Agent Gibbs.
thank you.
most people don't know that the Marine code is not unlike the code of Islam, as written in the Holy Koran.
honor, courage, commitment.
same three philosophies that Islam teaches.
yet, ignorance and bigotry remain a problem in the military.
well, ignorance isn't unique to any one group, Agent David.
all we can do is try our best to educate and pray for acceptance as a whole.
lieutenant Ellis-- he find acceptance?
like many of the Islamic marines I counsel, Thomas tried, but opposition can be overwhelming.
yet, he stuck with it, determined to become a Muslim.
because, I think, he found something that was missing in his life.
thomas referred to his awakening as a devout epiphany.
that's when he became Tareef Bashir. -- Yes.
and how did the rest of his unit react to his conversion?
well, some were open to it. Others not so much.
they found his need to pray multiple times a day inopportune and dangerous.
was any one marine more vocal about it than any other?
thomas did ask me to personally speak to a First Sergeant Louis Tibbens.
successful?
well, let's just say that some battles can never be won.
spoke to Ellis's C.O. He was on vacation with his family, but he did confirm that Tibbens and Ellis did not get along.
Louis Tibbens, home on leave. Athens, West Virginia. Population: 900.
bigger than Stillwater. But does it have the charm?
or the perpetual smell of coal.
I always liked that smell.
keep going.
Yes, uh...no criminal priors, boss, uh, but Tibbens does have two NJPs for being disrespectful to a superior officer.
Tony, you and Ziva find Tibbens.
McGee, look into Ellis's Muslim life.
as Tareef Bashir?
let's see if two names means he's leading two lives.
how the hell can you sit like this all day? No, I'm serious.
you'd think, after all these years, they'd give you a couple of walls, some privacy.
come on. Got a job for you.
where are we going? - It's a surprise.
here.
you're building toys.
no. We're building toys.
so, when did you get into the spirit?
Oh, I don't know.
for me, it's more about the wood, though having that deadline of the 24th has been good.
you don't believe in Santa, but you believe in hobbies.
as long as you believe in something, I guess.
it settles my mind, Dad. Keeps my hands busy.
so, you want me to finish all this, paint it and put it together, huh?
if you want. It's up to you.
if it settles my mind.
you want to let those kids down at the children's hospital, go right ahead.
you're trying to Tom Sawyer me into whitewashing a fence for you.
no, not for me. With me.
if you feel up to it.
go to work.
there's a steak in the fridge. We'll talk when I get back.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Dad.
I mean that.
okay.
if Santa's looking for Rudolph, I think I know what happened.
Tibbens' sister described this place perfectly.
so, this is where a "red throat" would hang out after being overseas for months.
it's not red throat; it's redneck.
and I think we found the entire cast ofHee Haw.
over there. That's him.
with his brother, Darryl, and his other brother, Darryl?
first Sergeant Tibbens.
call me Tibbs.
they call you Mr. Tibbs?
who the hell are you? -- NCIS.
I'm Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
this is my probationary sidekick, Agent Ziva David.
what's the problem?
thomas Ellis. He's dead.
Allah didn't save his ass, huh?
guess he should have gone back to Iraq where he belonged.
where were you at dawn this morning?
why, do I need an alibi? -- Couldn't hurt.
I was in a hunting blind. With these two.
can you prove it?
got a six-point buck in the bed of my pickup.
how is that for proof?
but I bet a pretty little thing like you never killed nothing before, huh?
I'll never tell. -- Oh, boy.
uh, you're going to have to come down to NCIS with us. Come on.
I got a better idea.
how about this one comes back to my place and decorates my tree. -- Oh, no.
happy Hanukkah. Now, let's go.
Ziva, no!
easy, easy. Heel.
sit down.
my turn.
red throats.
rednecks. -- Whatever.
what people believe in is their own business, but the brass knows having a devout Muslim riding patrols could blow up in our faces.
Really? Why?
hajis think when a white marine starts reciting the Fatiha, he's mocking them, and they hate him for it.
and they hate us even more, so we get concerned.
you get concerned-- enough to kill?
wasn't me.
so, if it wasn't you, who was it, then?
he knows something.
could be anyone.
who?
look, somebody out there felt strong enough to offer us money, good money-- to get Ellis to quit the Corps for good.
so, someone paid you guys to be bigots?
it was for the safety of the unit.
so, somebody offered you money. Who?
don't know.
traveled word of mouth.
we answered to a PO box, got wired the money.
no questions asked.
Oh, my God. Remember freshman year-- Ms. Santa?
Abby? -- McGee, you're here.
Hey, got any, uh, specifics on the metal we pulled from Ellis's wound?
it's, uh... mass spec's working on it as we speak.
but there's someone you have to meet.
this is one of my very bestest friends in the whole world.
we went to college together, and she's the lab tech over at the VA now.
Carol Wilson, Special Agent McGee.
how goes it, McGee? -- Goes great.
much better than this guy.
Santa-- I don't know why he did the lap band. I told him not to.
well, you know, Santa-- can't have a lap band, you know. He's got to be...
doesn't work. What are you drinking?
um, Caf-nog. It's an old family recipe.
speaking of families-- tell him.
this is my nephew, Fisher.
how cute is he?
his mother, my sister, is stationed on a naval destroyer in the Indian Ocean.
fisher has been staying with Carol until she gets back.
I took Fisher to the mall today.
watched as kid after kid sat on some lame-ass Santa's lap and asked for toys, video games.
but not Fisher.
all Fisher asked for was to see his mom on Christmas Eve.
on a destroyer?
Yeah, so... we thought you could help.
look, I sympathize, okay, but satellite feeds to the Indian Ocean are restricted to all but the highest priority communications.
what's a higher priority than a little boy that wants to see his mom on Christmas?
McGee-- he's, like, a miracle worker.
if anyone can do this, he can. Right, McGee?
boss, I've been running bank records on each marine in Ellis's unit.
so far, only two marines, including First Sergeant Tibbens, accepted a bribe
four grand apiece. -- Merry Christmas.
all the money was drawn from the same overseas account and deposited around the same time.
it's a dummy corp. -- Interpol is checking into it.
tell them to check faster.
you do it.
not you, boss. You.
I mean, how many languages do you speak, anyway?
including the language of love, ten.
Yeah. Gibbs. -- Leroy, you have to come home.
dad, I can't. -- I need you here.
I almost burned your house down. -- You did what?
sir, everything's okay.
Hey, guys. Thanks. -- No problem.
dad... you okay?
when was the last time you... you cleaned that flue?
the damn fireplace was all clogged.
what is all this? -- Boxes.
decorations? -- They're your mom's stuff.
no use leaving 'em at home, I... had 'em shipped for the tree.
it's a beauty, isn't it?
Yeah, yeah, it's good, it's fine.
will you please stop patronizing me?
if you don't like what I'm doing, speak up.
dad, I am trying to make this work.
and I'm not?
will you please put that box in another room?
I don't like being around what's in it.
it's secure. -- It's dangerous.
why won't you do what I ask?
how come everything with you ends up in an argument?
for just once, will you listen to what I'm asking you?
all right, all right, I'll move it.
I'm going for a walk.
you want some company?
I'm all right. I'm fine.
Yeah. Gibbs. -- Spoke to Interpol, boss.
got the account that was paying those guys to pressure Ellis.
you got a name? - Colonel George Ellis.
his father?
how dare you guys come in here and accuse a decorated marine...
a reverend, no less-- of hurting his own son.
it's a fact. -- It's a lie.
not according to the bank.
people do things for such misguided reasons.
well, marines aren't just people, sir.
you're right, Pat, they're not, but they abide by the same laws. Your father didn't.
Tina, we need to get in touch with James Hanlin.
you have his number, right? I mean, I understand.
you need a shoulder to cry on and he was happy to talk, among other things.
where were you the morning Thom was killed?
with friends, and Patrick was at school. Why are you doing this?
because you're not being straight with us.
it's okay, Tina.
they have a right to know everything.
you're correct, Agent DiNozzo, but I didn't want him discharged.
I just wanted this Muslim nonsense to end.
you paid off the men he trusted with his life.
because I thought if Thom knew he was putting them in danger, he would stop being selfish.
what I did was wrong but well-intentioned.
and if it led to my son's death, then God forgive me, and Thom's god, too.
one and the same, Colonel.
do you really think the colonel was involved in his son's death?
well, he has a congregation.
humiliation can do irrational things to people.
agent DiNozzo, this is Delores Bromstead. -- It's her.
Hi, Delores. - Is something wrong?
no, I... I- I just... I- I have a cold.
Delores. Human resources, the Grinch.
watch, watch, watch. This is going to be really good.
you crack me up. - Not funny. My office...
no, it's not... That's not funny.
you be there. - Of course I'll be there.
with bells on. Big silver bells.
good-bye. - Okay.
someone broke my cover.
she knows I'm her Secret Santa.
McGee, you wouldn't do that.
she wants me to meet her at 6: 00 on Christmas Eve.
to exchange gifts?
to wrap me in a coon of ivy and suck the Christmas joy out of me.
okay, I'm going to say this again.
she is probably someone who just lacks social skills, so be nice, get her something special, kill her with kindness.
or with a stake of holly through the heart. What should I get her?
David. -- Ziva, meet me in Abby's lab.
all right.
any of these things could kill, but none of them did.
any luck ID'ing the murder weapon?
this job is not about luck.
it's about the keen eye of science. -- Abby...
would I have called you down here if I didn't have something?
hold that thought.
go ahead, taste one.
I'm sorry, Abby, I could never eat you.
I'll take one to go... for my dad.
Abbs, I hope you have something more than a gingerbread cookie.
Yeah, I have aluminum and titanium.
I found minute particles in Lieutenant Ellis's head wound.
how about a baseball bat? -- That's a very good guess, Gibbs.
so I used the angle of impact, the depth of the wound, and the density of bone to work my way backwards to simulate the kill.
what's that? -- On Dasher...
Oh, you weren't supposed...
merry Christmas. -- To see that.
um, okay, here, so... check out the death blow.
it's the speed at which it impacts Ellis's skull that's what's impressive. Watch this.
whoever killed Lieutenant Ellis was definitely athletic and knew how to generate some serious momentum.
Mrs. Ellis, your father-in-law said you were here.
I wanted to see where it happened.
I am Agent David from NCIS. I hope you don't mind. Can we talk?
what could you possibly ask me that your friends don't already know?
look, I know we have brought up some personal issues.
the affair you had while your husband was overseas
did he know about it?
eventually. He knew that James and I were good friends.
you are in excellent shape, yes?
agent David, what is the purpose of this?
do you still play softball? - I'm sorry?
your husband-- he was killed by a blow to the head, possibly by a bat.
the angle of the blow was unique.
and you think that I did it?
well, you returned to the crime scene. -- Look...
I have a funeral to plan, a military funeral for a hero and a husband that I loved very deeply.
now, if you'll excuse me.
and by...by the time I got there,
Leroy had fallen asleep, he left the gate unlocked.
I don't remember what happened next.
well, I spent the next 25 hours trying to round up 26 missing sheep.
that's right. That's right. -- Hello, Jethro.
your father has been regaling me with stories of his youth.
we have a lot in common.
naive heartbreak, tales of adolescent... chivalry.
Oh, oh, and fond memories of skinny-dipping as children.
come on, getting late.
Oh, yeah, time to go.
Yes, there is Christmas shopping to be done and a roose to be goasted.
a goose to be roasted.
Ah, a pleasure to finally meet you.
pleasure is all mine.
Where's my coat?
okay. -- What a sweet, lovely man, Jethro, and certainly much warmer than you depicted him, and in many ways more accessible than you are.
duck, please. My dad?
well, you understand I cannot make a firm diagnosis on the basis of such a short meeting, but there is most definitely something wrong.
well, how bad?
that's an interesting question.
I doubt what you experienced was any kind of dementia.
I mean, despite his disorientation, your father shows no signs of impaired recognition, has no trouble solving problems.
he certainly doesn't have any symptoms of motor aphasia.
well, what the hell is wrong with him?
something far more old-fashioned, I believe.
your father...is under significant emotional distress, the kind one sees when one loses a loved one or...
I mean, has he experienced any kind of trauma recently?
well, it's nothing personal, Jethro, but I don't think he came here for your uplifting holiday cheer.
Martha Stewart, you are not.
why'd he come?
well, the answer to that question is not in my purview.
you are, when all is said and done, the investigator.
I prescribe some phone calls back home on your father's behalf.
they just might prove enlightening.
okay, so you're telling me that Ensign Blake cannot be reached on board?
well, you know what? This is an emergency.
I have direct orders from Admiral... Nicholas Whitebeard.
Yes, yes, that is his name.
he's the admiral that oversees the northern polar regions.
great. Okay, get back to me as soon as possible, please. Thank you.
misplaced tidings of joy, McScrooge?
I'm donating my time to a very, very worthy charity this year.
how worthy? -- Very.
who are you doing this favor for, McGee?
Abby, her friend, and the big man.
Gibbs? -- Nope.
director Vance? -- Bigger... and rounder.
DiNozzo. Yes, sir.
got it, yeah.
that was Director Vance; he just spoke with SECNAV.
Colonel Ellis was visiting his Chesapeake Bay home at the time the lieutenant was killed.
SECNAV's house? -- Yep.
and the daughter-in-law? - She drove him. Thom stayed home.
well, that is an airtight alibi.
so we have nothing.
in a manner of speaking. All I want for Christmas is a clue trail.
I must see Special Agent Gibbs.
chaplain El-Sayed. -- We have a problem.
I just got this in the mail.
the letter came through the military postal service.
so it could have been dropped in a box on any base.
by someone who has easy access to you.
so you think the threat is real?
or a distraction if we're getting too close.
NCIS will provide protection.
that won't be necessary.
you have a wife and a daughter.
whom I love very much, but I am also a Navy Chaplain.
a man of honor and pride.
bullheaded stubbornness.
look, as much as I am here to pray for the injured and the dying,
I am also here to open the minds of people.
to help them to understand the beauty and strength of Islam.
you talk to teenagers, Chaplain?
Yes. Before society dictates for them what is and isn't moral.
you see, in the Muslim religion, the most immoral thing a person can do is to not accept someone who lives by the Pillars of Islamic Belief.
so, a while back, Thomas asked me to speak to his brother's prep school class.
so you spoke with Patrick Ellis?
I did.
and let me just say, it is amazing how two siblings can be so very different.
how fun would it be to have a totally impromptu Christmas party, like, right now?
we could decorate my test-tube tree, we could warm up dumplings in the incubator.
Abby! -- I know. Typing.
I feel like Scrooge being visited by three grumpy ghosts.
you want to see the attack again, right? -- The point of impact.
like I said, whoever did this had agility, speed and power on their side.
well, if I don't mind saying so, I have many of those qualities myself.
Where's that generous holiday spirit, probette?
bah Hum-Bog. -- Bah what?
here's another angle, Gibbs. -- Freeze it right there.
Patrick Ellis played lacrosse?
Yeah, team captain.
Abby, try lacrosse. -- Checking.
okay, today's lacrosse sticks are a composite of aluminum and titanium, and the head is made out of nylon and leather mesh.
the exact same breakdown found in the wound.
Abel and Cain.
he killed his own brother.
what's going on?
so, Patrick, we know that you were at the park the other morning with Thomas.
I was at school. What are you talking about?
no. You went there to confront him about being Muslim.
you argued, you lost your temper.
most lacrosse players like to run with their sticks. Where's yours?
dad, I-I just went on a... a run.
is it broken, or did you destroy the evidence?
I like the letter to the chaplain.
the cut-and-paste letters-- very Zodiac.
dad, you got to believe me.
thom was embarrassing us.
people were laughing at him. I did this for you.
thomas just wanted to find the good in people.
Yes, he found God, his God, and that humiliated me, but he was still my son.
but I'm your son, too.
you taught us to be proud, you know.
proud of this family.
and when Thom changed, everything changed, because the one thing this family always had was honor, and he ruined that.
I loved him so much, and he turned his back on us.
I don't know. Maybe we turned our back on him.
not very traditional.
Yeah, it is.
let's talk.
you called Betty Hannigan?
she told me to call the sheriff.
ed sent you the report?
how about you fill in some of the details?
he rumbled up in an old fastback.
whole town could hear him. -- Yeah. Dirt-kicker looking for trouble.
I guess.
the Dobson girl was in the store.
she had a friend visiting. I - I never got her name.
he said he come there to rob me.
he had a gun, Leroy.
I told him to take anything he wanted from the register, but...the girls were in the corner, crouching, terrified.
he turned after them and...
well, that's not the first time you've fired that Winchester.
no. It's not the first time I killed somebody, either.
but it's the first time I saw the face.
twenty-three.
had a kid, somebody told me.
looks different from up there in the cockpit, huh?
uh, yeah, yeah.
from up there, it doesn't look like much of anything.
you pull the trigger, feel the release, nothing.
I never even thought about it much.
now, that's all I think about.
how did you do it all these years, son?
I need to know.
this why you came?
that and because it's Christmas.
it's not supposed to be easy.
nobody said it would be, huh?
no.
attention on deck!
I can't. I can't. Please, I don't want to. -- Of course you can. Go back. Go back!
I don't want to. I don't want to. You can't make me. -- Come on, Tony.
go back! -- I don't want to do it. I can't do it.
special Agent DiNozzo?
merry Christmas, Delores.
I got this for you. I looked in your personnel file.
which is legal,'cause I have that security clearance.
but I saw that when you were eight years old, all the little girls in your neighborhood, they all got this incredible doll, the-the Knee-High Cherry Pie doll.
and you didn't get one.
uh, I guess Santa didn't make enough that year, so...
I got this for you.
all right, Fisher. Right this way, my friend.
what is this place?
this is a very special room that only a few people know about.
it's a magic room called MTAC.
aunt... -- Don't look at me.
see, Santa told me very specifically to bring you here.
Why? What's gonna happen?
well, let's make a Christmas wish and see if it comes true.
how about that? -- Yeah.
want you to shut your eyes good and tight.
got 'em closed? All right. Now.
all right, I want you to think of the one thing you want for Christmas more than anything else in the entire world.
you ready?
Oh, Fisher, baby, is that you?
mom!
Oh, I love you, sweetheart. Merry Christmas.
look at you. You are getting so big.
I got all the mail you sent, all your artwork. Your pictures.
I'll make you more. -- I can't wait.
I have told everybody here all about you, about how proud I am of you.
you know, we're going to have a big Christmas dinner here tonight.
but I'd rather be there instead.
I wish you were, too.
well, not bad, huh? Pulled it off. -- Hey, they said I can read you a story.
would you like that? - Yeah!
this was my favorite story...
you would make a great Santa.
twas the night before Christmas... -- I guess you just got to believe.
...not a creature was stirring...
I do believe.
the stockings were hung by chimney with care in hopes that St. Nicholas...
I'll go warm up the sleigh.
Oh, come on! I put it right on the numbers.
you do that on your check ride, you're going to lose points, man.
Yeah, yeah.
no hotdogging.
everything by the book.
get the car, Walid. I'll only be a couple of minutes.
Yes, Your Highness.
wish I had someone like that to run my errands.
walid doesn't get his act together, you can have him.
for the last time, my name is Anthony DiNozzo Jr.
my father is Anthony DiNozzo Sr.
I live in Washington, DC.
he lives in New York City.
is that so complicated?
junior, Senior.
can you follow that?
what is going on?
Tony's trying to withdraw money from a bank in New York.
sounds like they confused his account with one of his father's, and he can't get the money.
let me get this straight.
you want me to spell my name again? Okay.
it's big "D," as in "dimwit." Little "I," as in "idiot."
big "N," as in "nimrod." Little "O," as in "obtuse."
what does he need the money for?
double "Z" as in "ZZ op," or maybe...
well, he and a couple of his frat buddies have decided to take a cruise this spring.
no, I'm not kidding!
I'm sure that won't lead to any trouble.
clean, wholesome fun.
why doesn't he just call his father to straighten things out?
Yes, I'll hold.
mind your own business.
grouchy.
left a message for his father two days ago.
Tony hasn't heard back from him.
Oh, you would like me to spell my name for you again?
are you guys in India?
DiNozzo, get off the phone.
got a dead foreign national. Pax River. Let's go.
pax River? Weren't we just there?
where are you going on your cruise?
it's need-to-know information.
you don't need to know.
aren't you too old for spring break?
no.
boss, car is registered to Beltway Executive Auto Leasing.
rented to a Prince Sayif Ibn Alwaan on a month-to-month.
hope he got the full coverage.
appears an explosive device was placed under the car.
get the vehicle to Abby.
the victim is Walid Abbas.
he's entered the United States on a visitor's visa.
he worked for the prince as his driver.
you know, there are over 7, 000 princes in the royal family.
what do you got, Duck? Tell me anything I don't know?
well, yes. He wasn't killed by the explosion.
at least not directly.
there are no burns or blistering on his... the skin of his hands.
cause of death was most likely blunt-force trauma when his head hit the tarmac.
I've heard the saying "He got blown out of his shoes," but I never thought I'd see it.
no. If the explosion had knocked his socks off, that would be impressive, wouldn't it?
how long has Prince Sayif been in the country?
almost three months.
he's attached to the Navy-Marine Corp's Strike Pilot Training Program.
where is he?
last I saw Sayif, he was in the hangar.
you've been his flight instructor the whole time?
Oh, no. He's been through several.
I've only had the pleasure for the past, uh, couple weeks.
I detect some... friction.
let's just say that I hope he doesn't screw up on his check ride.
that way, he'll graduate the day after tomorrow, with his class, and he won't be our problem anymore.
I was just making arrangements to be picked up.
cancel them.
don't want to jump to conclusions here, but we have to assume that that bomb was meant for you.
until we know otherwise, you're under our protective custody.
Yeah. I don't think so.
look, I am sorry about Walid, Agent Gibbs, but if you know anything about the Saudi royal family, assassinations are a part of our lives.
I came to the United States for flight traing, and I'm not going to let what happened stop me.
okay.
I have no influence with your country.
but I do with the United States Navy, and I'll have your traing stopped immediately.
okay. Protective custody on my terms.
I'm not going to be sequestered on any base or in a government safe house.
I'm staying at the presidential suite at the Adams House.
if you would like to protect me there...
you're welcome to.
I've been in contact with the Saudi embassy.
they insist their Royal Guards be part of the security detail.
we'll coordinate with them.
where is Prince Sayif now?
he's here.
we brought him back to the Navy yard while his suite and adjoing rooms are being cleared.
agent Gibbs.
ma'am.
al Jazeera is reporting that Jihad Al Hurriya is claiming responsibility for the assassination attempt.
you aware of them?
Yes. It translates to "Freedom Warriors."
they're an offshoot of the Mujahideen.
didn't know they had a presence here in the United States.
don't know.
NSA is checking into it.
you questioned Sayif.
did he mention Jihad Al Hurriya?
no.
he didn't seem too concerned about the incident, either, ma'am.
the Saudi ambassador assured me that Prince Sayif will be leaving the country as soon as he graduates from flight training.
so he's only our problem for two more days, then.
his father, Prince Omar, is a major player in the royal family.
we need to be kept in the loop.
Yes, ma'am.
let's call the embassy from my office.
you need me? -- Uh, no, boss. Just gotta tell Tony here something.
what?
you have a visitor. -- Who?
you'll see. -- Tell me.
no.
what's the matter with you?
junior mentioned you.
but he never told me what you look like.
you are stunning, Ziva.
do you ever think of wearing your hair down?
junior.
dad.
what are you doing here?
I just want this mix-up at the bank straightened out, all right?
I mean, why is your name still on the account as a trustee?
not to worry. I'll-I'll take care of it.
all right, well, you know, you could have just done it with a phone call.
sure. And I will.
it's, uh... just that we haven't seen each other in a long time.
and you thought you'd just fly down and surprise me?
well, I took the train. It's not that far.
you all right?
never felt better.
I mean, nothing's wrong?
we'll have dinner, catch up.
so, um, tell me about Ziva.
Ziva is Ziva. Nothing to tell.
hotel suite's been cleared. We're headed over.
be right there.
isn't that Prince Sayif Ibn Alwaan?
Yes, it is.
where you staying?
my God. He has grown up.
dad. How do you know him?
his father, Prince Omar, and I have been in business together.
we met years ago in Monte Carlo.
what's Sayif doing here?
well, he was the target of an assassination attempt this morning.
Hey, should I continue holding the door?
I'm coming! I'll meet you in the garage!
take it easy!
what happened?
I can't talk about it.
car bomb.
has his father been told?
Yes. He's, uh, flying in from Riyadh.
look, I have to get Sayif to the Adams House Hotel.
I'll take you downstairs, get you a cab.
are you sure, uh, you don't want to tell me something?
you're-you're busy. It can wait.
who's that with Sayif?
it's his older brother, Prince Abdalla.
lives here in DC.
he's a deputy minister at the Saudi embassy.
they do not know I speak Arabic.
Oh, good.
Sayif is getting chewed out for his Western ways.
his brother believes that his pleasure-seeking lifestyle brought on the attack.
that is too disgusting to translate.
I apologize for the family disagreement.
prince Abdalla, this is Special Agent Gibbs.
pleasure.
what happened this morning is very disturbing.
not only for the assassination attempt on my brother, but the tragic death of Walid.
he was not only Sayif's aide, but a family friend.
you think that Jihad Al Hurriya was involved?
it's very possible.
they are the sworn enemy of our government.
Hey, boss. We got agents posted in the lobby and the garage.
the Royal Guards are covering the stairwells and the corridors.
excuse me.
where do you think you're going?
fitness center.
I'm afraid not; we have to make sure it's secure, and you need to be accompanied by an agent.
fine. I choose her.
Oh, Jethro, I was just about to call you.
x-rays confirm my initial determination.
blunt-force trauma was indeed the cause of death.
I'll be sure to tell him.
director Vance.
it's not often that I'm graced by your presence in Autopsy.
to what do I owe the pleasure?
Gibbs and I spoke to the Saudi embassy.
they have requested a quick release of the body for religious reasons.
well, as soon as I'm done here, I can make arrangements for him to be picked up.
thank you.
doctor?
how's your mother doing?
thank you for asking.
she is, uh, slipping away, slowly.
losing touch with reality.
when I visited her this morning, in her room, she insisted that the clock on the wall was going backwards.
actually, I've had days that felt like that.
haven't we all?
Abby. What are you doing?
don't say it, Gibbs. I know.
my shoes and socks.
it's "Mismatch Monday."
for who? -- For me.
how about it's "Make my Day Monday" for me?
okay, I am searching for the signature of a bomb maker.
I found fragments of a bomb.
and I think it's homemade.
Why?
because my schnozola has detected a trace of nitromethane.
I heard Tony's father's in town. -- Yeah, he is.
what triggered it?
I found remnants of a timer. I'm hoping to find more.
what does he look like? --Who?
Tony's father! -- I haven't seen him.
anything else? -- Yeah.
I'm wondering if Tony and him have the same sense of humor.
I'm wondering if you're gonna focus on the case.
right.
okay, so I salvaged the vehicle's onboard nav system.
I'm going to download the data to a hard drive.
and, uh, hopefully, the little magical zeroes and ones will let us know where the vehicle's been and when...
yeah?
in MTAC, boss.
right, McGee. Be right there.
Thanks, Abbs.
echelon's picking up chatter, emanating in real time from the Washington, DC metropolitan area.
this is Barry Kester with NSA.
special Agent Gibbs.
we locked on the IP address of the computer sending the message.
could be a Jihad Al Hurriya operative in the area.
have a location in a second.
key words intercepted were "Prince Omar," "assassination," "contract," and "killer.
we got it. Computer is in the guest business center of the Adams House.
that's where we're keeping Prince Sayif.
I'll take the stairs.
Where's the business center? - What?
the business center! Where is it?
Oh, uh, down that corridor, on the left.
okay!
where is the guest business center?
Where?!
um, right down there.
federal agents! Hands in the air!
junior, what's the matter with you?
put that thing down.
maybe Tony didn't have a mother.
maybe he was cloned.
well, there certainly is a strong familial resemblance.
agent Gibbs.
well, you finally get to meet the real Tony DiNozzo.
I didn't expect it was going to be under these circumstances.
have a seat.
you've got some explaining to do.
well...I was just, uh, e-mailing some of my business associates - 我在圣巴特发展了一处度假胜地。
um, Junior wouldn't explain, but, uh, what warranted guns being pointed in my face and being brought down here for questioning?
you used certain key words that were picked up on a global surveillance network.
monitors, voice and data transmissions.
that stuff really exists?
I thought that was only in spy movies.
how does it work?
it's classified.
this where you bring the, uh, bad guys for the third degree?
you mentioned "Prince Omar" and "assassination" in your e-mails. Why?
I confess.
I'm a bit of an opportunist.
uh, money's tight these days, and I'm missing a key piece of financing.
so I thought that fate had interced when I heard that Al was going to be in town.
Oh, yeah, that's what Prince Omar Ibn Alwaan's friends call him...
so I was notifying some of my investors that, uh, Al was going to be in town because of the assassination attempt on his son.
why are you at the Adams House?
Oh, I'm staying there.
it's my favorite in Washington.
Donald, the concierge, he's a miracle worker.
he can get you anything you want: Theater tickets, restaurant reservations...
have you ever been to the Rooftop Grill?
no.
they've got the best rib eye in town.
he's right about that.
it is delicious.
you keep your father clear of the Ibn Alwaan family. -- Right, boss.
make sure he gets the message. -- Got it.
Gibbs! Hi, Gibbs.
I just... I wanted to see what Tony's dad looked like, but...
go.
I'm just gonna go.
Yeah, okay.
okay, Dad...
junior...
what are you thinking?
he's not involved.
But?
but he's got an agenda.
agreed.
macallan 18, three fingers, one ice cube.
you rembered.
well, what would cocktail hour be without a single-malt scotch and a lecture from Senior?
and now you're going to lecture me?
what are you drinking?
non-alcoholic beer.
the downside to law enforcement.
are there any upsides?
well, I get to carry a gun.
you've always been disappointed I became a cop.
no.
felt that way to me.
I always, uh, was supportive.
I never said anything.
exactly.
what did you want me to say?
well, I don't know.
maybe like, uh,"Hey, Junior, I'm glad you found a career you're passionate about."
"I'm proud of you and what you're doing." Something like that.
how do you know I don't feel that way?
how would I? We never talked.
I mean... I get it.
it must have been tough.
your wife dies, and you're left with an eight-year-old kid.
but your solution, Dad, was to warehouse me in boarding schools and summer camps.
and half the time, I never knew where you were or what you were doing.
I need a closer relationship.
you forget.
we took some great vacations together.
like the trip to Maui where you left me in a hotel room for two days, and I was 12 years old?
Oh, come on, Junior.
I explained that to you. I had to go back to the mainland to close a deal.
with a rich divorced?
who was, uh, very attractive, as I recall.
a deal is a deal.
how's my current stepmother?
Ex-stepmother.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I actually liked Karen.
Phoebe.
you missed one.
were you going to tell me about that?
I don't like to advertise my failures.
well, my condolences.
my congratulations. And my condolences.
thank you.
I have to relieve Ziva.
now, listen... you stay away from the Ibn Alwaans. Please.
I'll call you.
Sayif's rented car went in for its 10, 000-mile service the day before the explosion.
the dealership was losing tools, so they installed surveillance cameras to cover all the bays.
now, the mechanic didn't see anything unusual on the vehicle.
and, as you can see, nothing was placed under it while it was there.
we backgrounded the mechanic-- he is clean --so the explosive device had to be planted on the vehicle after it left the dealership.
I'm going to focus on that time period.
how'd it go at the hotel?
prince Sayif is a chauvinistic royal pain in the tush.
well, he's not used to anyone saying no to him.
you may have to hire someone to protect him from me.
I just got a back channel call from MI-6.
they have a deep-cover mole planted inside Jihad Al Hurriya.
he made contact this morning.
you confirmed they're responsible?
just the opposite.
claim's bogus.
just somebody grabbing media attention.
well, how reliable's the mole?
what's his batting average?
led the league. He's batting a thousand.
chatter indicates that we've been looking in the wrong direction.
this was not an attack by terrorists.
do you have any other leads?
no.
okay, so how many amendments to the Constitution?
uh, Bill of Rights is the first ten.
Prohibition's 18.
I'm guessing 23.
nobody likes a smartass, David.
why do I have to study all of this and you don't?
I was born here.
Hello, Mr. DiNozzo.
Tony- please.
morning, Ziva.
good morning, Tony.
are you waiting for somebody?
no.
you've got Junior working so hard, I was just killing some time doing one of my favorite things: people watching.
your hair-- looks great.
thank you.
straighten your leg. There you go.
is that good? -- Very good.
feel the stretch behind your knees.
sting does a lot of yoga, and I like him.
keep breathing.
DiNozzo... -- Boss.
you know, it's not as bad as it looks.
it's actually an ancient form of meditation.
it's a good thing.
special Agent Gibbs, you had breakfast?
the party's over.
explain.
Sayif had a date.
he actually had a... he had a... he had a couple of dates.
and he wanted to go clubbing, and I had to make the command decision that we would go clubbing here in-in-in the penthouse suite, and then Ashley, the a. m. yoga instructor arrived.
and I guess things got a little out of hand.
this a good thing?
well, nobody got hurt.
I got in a stretch.
what's going on here?
relax, Abdalla.
what, what?
father's plane landed a half hour ago.
he'll be here any minute.
ladies, out. Time to leave.
okay.
get yourself dressed, Sayif.
what were you thinking?
honestly, I didn't think you'd be here for another hour.
time to get up.
these yours?
Oh, yeah.
I'll intercept father in the lobby.
has it been that long?
Oh, at least.
96, I think.
son.
father.
well, uh... I have a little family matter to attend to, but, uh, then we should talk.
where are you staying?
Oh, right here in this hotel.
wonderful. Wonderful.
let's go.
I told you to handle it.
I spoke to him. I think he's losing his hearing.
give me a reason not to bench you.
I won't let him out of my sight.
I've got something.
so do I.
what do you got?
you show me yours first.
whoever made this bomb-- amateur.
sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.
cheap components, poorly constructed, and you want to know the weird thing?
the timer didn't set it off.
how's that?
this bomb was supposed to go off 30 minutes after it actually did.
then what triggered it?
I have a theory.
none of the wires were properly insulated or grounded.
so anything could have set it off.
like a bump, or a really, really strong vibration.
witnesses saw a jet flying low overhead.
so show me yours.
after Sayif's car left the service station, it only went two places - hotel garage where security cameras show that no one approached it and Pax River the next morning.
GPS shows that after Sayif was dropped off at the hanger, the car drove to a remote part of the base where there are no security cameras.
that's the only place the bomb could have been planted.
hmm, so... where are you going?
I got to check with Ducky about something.
will you be accompanying the body back to Riyadh?
Yes. Walid died in the service of my brother.
our families have been friends for as long as I can rember.
I'm going to have to ask you to wait right here.
what is it?
prince Abdalla, this is Dr. Mallard, our medical examiner.
I'm sorry, but I cannot release the body just yet.
I was told Walid's body is ready.
we have a royal jet standing by at the airport.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I have one more test I must perform.
I can assure you there will be no desecration.
this is unacceptable.
your State Department will hear from my embassy.
come on, Dad, I got a lot of work to do.
almost done, Junior.
you'll be happy to know that, among other things, I've straightened out that mix-up with your bank account.
the funds will be available.
Oh, that's great.
do you have to stick your nose in everyone's business?
makes me a good investigator.
give me that.
it's for me.
1899/12/31 08: 00
perfect.
Yeah, I'm in suite 901.
still have those magic fingers?
can't wait.
you gave a call girl this number?
junior, that was the hotel spa.
I'm a little tense. I need a massage.
Oh, Gibbs, Ziva.
Sayif behaving?
he is fine.
who's watching Prince Charming?
he's in the air.
his check ride. He cannot get in trouble for the next three hours.
unless his instructor ejects him at 20, 000 feet.
well, you're busy and I'm in the way here.
I'm going to go back to the hotel.
uh, you know what, I am going to make you an offer you can't refuse.
very Special Probationary Agent Ziva David is going to give you a personal, special tour of NCIS headquarters.
come on.
well, that is a lovely offer, but I'm sure Ziva must be busy.
Yeah, she is.
I'll show you around.
boss...
we'll start with the armory.
back to work.
I'm flashing back.
boarding school.
headmaster wants to talk to my dad.
Yeah, Tony. -- Where are you?
autopsy. -- Emergency.
boss really needs you up here right now. Get your skinny butt on the move, pronto!
run!
what do you want McGee to do?
use his computer magic.
I need to find out what my father's been doing on this thing.
cause he's up to something.
I can smell it.
this doesn't look like an armory to me.
sit.
when you offered to take me on the tour, I suspected you had an ulterior motive.
what's on your mind?
your son.
what has, uh... Junior done now?
Tony likes to hide behind the face of a clown.
but he's the best young agent I've ever worked with.
well, I'm glad to hear that.
when was the last time you talked to him?
I mean, really-- talked to him?
well, we keep in touch.
four years ago, your son came very close to dying from pneumonic plague.
and I expected to see you.
you didn't show then. Why are you here now?
he never told me he was sick.
Oh, so you don't keep in touch.
what's your point?
Tony inherited his personality from you.
but I get the feeling there's a lot about your life you don't share.
I should tell you to piss off.
but I do know that Junior thinks the world of you.
so I'll keep this civil.
you have children, Gibbs?
had. A daughter.
but unfortunately... I didn't get the chance to know her as an adult.
you have that opportunity to get to know Tony.
do it.
are we finished?
you were right!
the trace evidence that Ducky swabbed from Walid's hands, it was unexploded particles of nitromethane.
the same explosive in the bomb.
walid planted the bomb under Sayif's car.
nice work!
you, too!
so, Walid unintentionally blew himself up when the vibrations from the jet triggered the explosion.
and the victim was his own killer.
hinky.
what was Walid's motive for planting the bomb?
well, as Sayif's aide, he had plenty of opportunities to kill the prince while they were alone.
maybe he was a suicide bomber and supposed to be in the car with Sayif.
would look like a terrorist act.
Hey, DiNozzo, are you with us?
Yeah, boss.
whoever hires the women around here deserves a bonus.
they're not only beautiful, but they're bright.
Oh, stop it.
this the end of the tour?
I think I've showed him everything.
well, uh, not everything.
dad!
agent Grady is waiting for you in Polygraph.
she would like to give you a demonstration.
Oh, no one's wiring me up.
but I would like to ask Abby a few more questions.
well, come on, then.
okay. We've been treating Walid like the victim.
let's start looking at him as the murder.
background him.
well, Sayif's the one that spent the most time with him and was the targeted victim.
he lands in 45 minutes.
go. Both of you, go talk to him.
DiNozzo, get away from that computer. We got to brief State.
have to break one of your rules, boss.
number six: "Never say you're sorry."
I let things get out of control in the hotel room.
Yeah. It's covered. Rule 18.
Oh, yeah.
it's better to seek forgiveness than ask permission.
am I forgiven?
no.
you've been distracted by your father.
it's that obvious?
he's not the man I thought he was.
I don't know my father.
no, boss, my father's always been a mystery to me.
just a wealthy one.
it turns out he's broke.
he has been for years.
his bank accounts are overdrawn, credit cards are frozen, property's foreclosed.
the guy's tapped out.
how'd you find that out?
McGee got me into his records.
but it turns out Senior's been living high on the low for quite some time.
I wonder if he was ever as rich as he appeared.
I think the reason he came to town to see me was to confess the charade.
but when he figured out that Prince Omar was coming to town, I think he, uh...
he saw the chance for one last score.
his whole life's one big con.
what are you going to do about it?
end the game.
when?
time to do it's when he checks out of the hotel.
he's staying in a $1, 000-a-night suite. He can't afford it.
he's running up a huge tab.
I'll get him when he tries to pay the bill.
what can you tell me, Gibbs?
well, we know who planted the bomb.
my protection detail!
miss me?
we need to ask you a few questions about Walid.
aren't you going to ask if I passed my check ride?
did you?
with flying colors.
good. Now you can go home.
how long have you and Walid been friends?
he was not my friend.
he was assigned to me by the embassy. My brother, to be exact.
were they close? -- Since they were kids.
the two of them shared religious and political beliefs.
your lifestyle has to be an embarrassment to them.
I think Walid's real job was to keep an eye on me for my brother.
he would do anything Abdalla asked him to do.
what?
walid planted the explosive under your car.
agent Gibbs...
what is it I can do for you?
you leaving?
shortly.
you just arrived.
pressing family matters.
we think your son's driver Walid planted the bomb.
if Prince Abdalla's here, we'd like to speak with him.
Sayif called and told me everything.
if you came here to ask Abdalla if Walid was following his orders, the answer is yes.
he admitted it?
unfortunately, he did.
and why would he do that?
he told me he felt his brother's lifestyle would bring shame to our family.
he thought it better if Sayif die as a martyr.
I'm sorry what he did took place on your soil.
where is Prince Abdalla?
at the airport, aboard a royal jet.
well, he's going to have to answer for what he's done.
as a member of the embassy's administrative staff, Abdalla has diplomatic immunity.
his safe passage is ensured.
you're gonna let him just get away?
he still is my son, Agent Gibbs.
fathers do what they have to do for their children.
this is my problem.
he will be dealt with most severely, I assure you.
now, if you'll excuse me.
agent DiNozzo...
would you please tell your father I regret not having more time to spend with him?
let him know I'll be in Monte Carlo next month.
maybe we can see each other there.
prince Omar said you could catch up with him in Monte Carlo next month.
he left?
he-he just landed this morning.
well, yeah... he's got a lot on his mind, Dad. Cut him some slack.
well, you have work to do, Junior.
I can check myself out.
Oh, no. I've got time.
I'll even drive you to the station. What do you think about that?
already called for a cab.
how may I help you?
uh, I'm checking out. DiNozzo, suite 901.
would you like me to leave that on your credit card?
actually, um... I need to talk to you about that.
I'll take care of Mr. DiNozzo.
uh, that's all right. I'm sure that, uh...Taylor can handle this.
Bruce, uh... I'm experiencing some problems with my credit card.
I don't think we'll be needing it, Mr. DiNozzo.
your bill has been paid in full.
I'll get you a copy for your records.
Oh, and also, something has been left here for you.
what is it?
a note from, uh, Prince Omar-- Al
and a, uh, confirmation number for an open-ended first-class flight to Monte Carlo.
I guess he... felt guilty about standing me up.
you lead a charmed life, don't you?
it was great seeing you, Junior.
I enjoyed our talk.
we should do that more often.
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
I mean it.
I love you, Anthony.
I love you.
what?
speaking of rain, the weatherman tells us the rains are going to continue to fall for the rest of the week.
what, dear? -- You need to apologize to Mom.
no, I will not apologize to your mother.
she's going to leave. -- Well, good. Let her go home.
will?! What was that?! What...?! -- Can't talk.
what the hell?
hold it right there!
Jethro working you so hard you have to do your laundry at the office?
stepped in a puddle.
he did not watch where he was walking.
he was texting. -- Me.
Tony thinks "Probationary Agent" means that I'm his personal assistant.
he wanted me to pick up his latte.
I was running late. -- That is your problem.
I hate rain. -- I love it.
I mean, rain is so invigorating, cleansing.
it make the air fresh and the city sparkle.
where is Jethro?
I have no idea.
um, I think he's in the building somewhere.
well, it can wait.
does anyone have any talc? This hurts.
would you just take your foot to the locker room, please?
any of you notice something different about Ducky?
Yeah, he has seemed awfully chipper as of late.
Ducky does seem plucky.
no one loves rain in DC.
no. His ties.
he's been wearing tie ties, not his bow ties.
Oh, that's very observant.
boss, hey, uh, Ducky was looking for you.
what's he want?
uh, don't know, but he left something for you on your desk.
let's go. Marine, shot. Rock Creek Park.
Oh, thanks, boss. Are these clean?
of course they are.
we searched the area.
found a nine-millimeter.
Yeah, looky there.
the FBI ERT, they removed a slug from the vehicle.
well, good luck finding any more.
Yeah, a lot of muddy footprints.
nothing that could be lifted.
well, get all the evidence. Collect it back to our lab, will you?
Hey, that's between you and the FBI.
we're not getting in the middle of that.
when did the Bureau get involved?
well, we called them in to assist with the ballistics.
you find anything on the victim?
just what looked like a house key. It was tied to his shoelaces.
Really? Then how did you ID Lieutenant Mayne?
mobile fingerprint scanner.
don't you guys use them?
well, I mean, they... they're coming. They just haven't quite been issued yet.
can I give it a go?
Yeah. All right. Just put your thumb on the screen.
Oh, hey, boss. How's he doing?
still in surgery.
park police, FBI can clean up here. Let's get to the hospital.
Timothy-- no middle name-- McGee.
you broke into a Metro PD impound yard?
what's the matter with you?
boss, that was supposed to be expunged.
run Mayne's service record. Notify next of kin.
if you need me.
Leah Mayne, lives in Woodley Park.
Oh, that's strange.
what now, McGee?
there must be something wrong with your fingerprint scanner.
according to his service record, Lieutenant Mayne is MIA. Went missing in Afghanistan six years ago.
Dr. Bailey, Post-Op.
page me if there's any change. -- Yes, Doctor.
when can we talk with him?
I don't know. One bullet grazed his forehead. The other went deep into his lower left abdomen.
he's lost a lot of blood. The slug is imbedded close to his spine.
it, uh, would be far too dangerous to remove at this time.
Ruth, will you keep his IV at 75cc's per hour?
Yes, Doctor. -- Thank you.
I'll let you know if there's any changes, Agent Gibbs.
this is surreal.
I mean... After all these years, not even a word.
I just assumed that my husband was dead and...and now you're telling me that he's alive and that he's living in Washington, DC, but he's been shot.
I mean, are you sure that it was John?
we have a fingerprint match, but we'd like you to make a visual identification.
you okay with that?
Yeah. -- Okay.
Dr. Ollie, Nuclear Medicine.
um, it looks like him.
the last time I saw John, he was... clean-shaven and he had a Marine buzz cut.
Oh, he had a birthmark on his...
hang on. Hold on. -- Oh, sorry.
nurse, please.
Brownish, circular?
it's John.
where has he been the last six years?
I don't know, but we're going to find out.
you need a minute?
thank you.
okay. Stay here.
if he regains consciousness, call me, and see if you can get any more out of her.
you subscribing to the DiNozzo Theory-- always suspect the wife?
I'm at the hospital... Do you know of any of his friends...?
okay. What do we got?
six years ago, Lieutenant Mayne was part of a three-man deep cover recon mission in Afghanistan.
he went missing.
all right. Thanks very much. -- The other two team members were Captain Gordon Holcomb and Sergeant Matthew Gontz.
Holcomb's still in the military. He's a major now, stationed in Quantico.
he's coming in tomorrow morning.
Gontz was honorably discharged five years ago.
still haven't found him, though we do know that he went through a divorce and a series of jobs.
I think he's having a little trouble adjusting to civilian life.
well, I am going to try and track him down through Social Security Administration.
Oh, you're a thirsty little boy.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
Yeah, we're gonna get you some water and some food and love.
what's the dog doing here?
Gibbs, this is Mortimer.
what's he doing here?
I am an SVPR.
a substitute volunteer puppy raiser.
Mortimer here is going to be a Seeing Eye dog one day and you're going to be the smartest boy in your whole class.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
okay, putting dog down now.
okay, so, uh... The gun.
it is... unregistered, and has only Lieutenant Mayne's prints on it.
as you can see, it is a nine-millimeter.
there were two shots fired, and 13 remain in the magazine.
the slug that FBI ERT pulled from the vehicle?
it's too mangled to match, but it's definitely bigger than a nine.
Ducky talked to the doctor.
Mayne's wounds weren't self-inflicted.
looks like a shoot-out.
Hey, what's going on with Ducky? He's acting very un-Ducky-like.
like-like every day, he leaves during lunch.
he's never done that before.
I mean, the Duck Man is a creature of habit. He brings in his lunch.
he eats at his desk.
where is he going? -- I'm sure he's fine.
uh, Abby, don't let that dog out of your sight.
that's not your bone.
excuse me, uh, Matthew Gontz?
Matthew Gontz? - Yeah?
NCIS. May we speak with you?
what's this about?
I've been out of the Marine Corps for years.
Yeah, we know. You've been hard to track down.
uh, we need to ask about a reconnaissance mission.
the one where Lieutenant Mayne went missing.
you know I've told that story a hundred times?
well, we need to hear it for ourselves.
it was just the three of us.
me, Captain Holcomb, Lieutenant Mayne.
we were inserted into a hostile environment.
it was a keyhole mission. Defensive weapons only.
am I cleared to tell you guys this stuff? This was classified.
we've been read into the program.
our mission was to place and recover remote target sensors in Mazar-e.
everything went according to plan until we made for the exit rendezvous.
that's when Lieutenant Mayne broke his leg.
how did it happen?
we were coming over a wall in a small village just outside of town.
he snagged his KA-BAR sheath on some barbed wire, and he fell.
it wasn't his day.
did you leave him behind?
no. Captain Holcomb and myself stashed him in the basement of an abandoned building while we went to commandeer a vehicle.
when we came back, he wasn't there. We assumed he was captured.
so you and Captain Holcomb went to the exit rendezvous?
we had to. We followed mission protocol.
look, I've never forgiven myself for leaving a team member behind.
must be tough.
the Marine Corps tore the country upside down looking for Mayne.
look, are we done? I gotta clock in.
for now.
wait. Um... why's all this coming up again?
John Mayne is no longer MIA.
he showed up yesterday morning.
he was shot.
I don't believe it.
Where'd it happen?
right here in DC.
you have any indication he was alive over the past six years?
the last time saw him was in Mazar-e. His KA-BAR sheath got snagged on some barbwire.
he broke his leg.
just wasn't his day.
Yeah, Gibbs. -- Boss, Lieutenant Mayne's awake.
be right there.
did you have any contact with Sergeant Gontz since Afghanistan?
no. The mission rely shook him badly.
I lost track with him after he got dischard.
has he been told Mayne's alive?
Yes, he has.
two milligrams of flurazepam. Call me if there's any changes, okay?
just keep me posted. Thank you. -- You're welcome.
he's conscious, which is a good sign, but he's incoherent.
worst thing for him right now is to be bombarded with questions.
I'm gonna keep him sedated.
for how long?
it's too early to tell.
Specl Agent Gibbs... My name's Rachel Wells.
I was told by police to see you.
about what?
my husband.
he went joggingyesterda, never returned home.
when I reported him missing and showed his picture to police, You're married to John Mayne?
no -- He's name was john Mayne?
no, his name's Christian Wells.
no, his name is John, and he's my husband.
I met Christian two years ago. -- Thanks.
on a tck at Georgetown. Thanks.
we're both runners.
we, um, smiled and nodded for about a month, and then went for coffee, then started dating.
how long you been married?
just over a year.
last Christmas in Hawaii, we eloped.
you met his family?
he doesn't have any family.
Christian's an only child and both his parents are dead.
but you're probably gonna tell me that-that's not true either.
his name's John Mayne.
he went MIA in Afghanistan six years ago.
your husband have a job?
he day-trades, manages his portfolio.
christian inherited a lot of money, so...
I mean that's not why I married him.
you're a runner, right?
Yeah.
how come the two of you didn't go running yesterday morning together?
I've been nursing a hamstring.
you know, I should probably get back upstairs to my husband.
you know he was meeting someone in the park yesterday?
no. -- Do you know he owned a gun?
he had it with him.
the district does not take fingerprints when issuing a driver's license.
that is why Christian Wells' name does not come up on the SCA
the records reflect his arrival in the Virginia-Maryland area five years ago.
nothing prior. Lieutenant Mayne obviously constructed a new life.
I found a whole lot of bank and brokerage accounts in Christian Wells' name.
look at that, boss.
this one mutual account alone, he has over $5 million in.
with what I found so far, his net worth is over $12 million. -- Where'd the money come from?
uh, don't know yet, but we are not the only ones checking him out.
the last two weeks, someone ran multiple credit checks on Wells.
you got a name?
I do. Peter Iger of Iger Investigations.
he's a P.I. I got the voice mail, left a message.
good. Keep working the source of the money.
Ziva, track down Iger.
Yeah. Keep the IV. Call me with an update in an hour.
can I talk to him now? -- Absolutely not.
he seems coherent.
barely. Just a couple of questions, Doc.
I'm sorry. He's not out of the woods yet. I dot want him upset.
have you informed the wife of his condition?
which one?
it's quite a dilemma, isn't it?
Dr. Tallridge, I've waited long enough. I'd like to see my husband now.
ma'am, I was just telling Agent DiNozz that your husband is still in critical condition.
if I let you into his room... -- No, no, no.
if you let that bimbo into my husband's room,
I will sue this hospital and you personally for everything that you've got.
you ever been married, Doc?
twice, but never at the same time.
dark SUV. -- Got it.
I'll be here... -- I'll be there as soon as I can. Thank you.
iger the P.I? -- Yeah.
nice tie. --Ah, thank you.
I found it at the Metropolitan Museum of Art store in w York.
its design is based on the Golden Hoard of Bactria, unearthed from the tombs of Tillya-tepe in northern Afanistan.
well, I like the flowers... Gotta go.
Oh, hey-ho.- You looking for this?
Ah, you did sign it. Thank you.
Yeah. Where you going?
I just need some personal time.
a long weekend will suffice.
if anything comes up, Mr. Palmer can deal with it.
if you need me, I'm reachable on my cell phone.
duck, everything okay?
Yeah, never better.
half my team's worried about you.
let me guess.
which half?
Abby and Ziva.
ICU tech, please report to the east wing nurses' station.
rise and shine, sleepyhead.
how you feeling?
I've felt better.
who are you?
that's a good estion. I can see you're thinking clearly.
I'm Anthony DiNozzo, Special Agent with NCIS.
like to ask you a couple of questions, Lieutenant Mayne.
bet you haven't heard at name in, what, six years?
listen, I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
is it better if call you "Christian Wells"?
Ooh, that got a response.
I don't know what you're talking about. -- Maybe you're right.
maybe I'm just a little confused.
I wouldn't be the only one. Got two women out in the waiting room.
both of them claim to be your wife.
where did you go after Afghanistan?
what are you doing in here?! You're not supposed to be in here!
I was trying to fluff his pillow. He looked uncomfortable.
you know what? Out! -- What?
out, out! - Listen, I didn't do anything.
you should know better. -- Everything's fine.
she just, you know, I went by... There's not a problem.
I just wanted to check on him, ask him a few questions.
what do you mean where am I?
Yeah, well, I'm not happy about it either.
well, what dyou want me to do, work miracles?
I'm still parked in front of her place.
Yeah, yeah.
no, he still hasn't shown.
hold on a second.
agent David?-- Dav-eed.
look, I'll call you the second I see him.
then e-mail it to me, Joey. I'll take a look.
thanks for meeting me here.
I haven't left this spot in three days.
hmm, stakeouts are brutal.
so, uh, what do you need?
why were you investigating Christian Wells?
come on. We know you ran credit checks on him.
Yeah. -- Why?
client hired me.
sorry. Not him.
so who hired you to find out about Wells?
guy had a Internet photo of a marathon runner crossing the finish line, thought it was somebody he knew.
I ran his registration number through the marathon's database.
runner's name was Christian Wes. He's not theerson the client was looking for.
I tried to do a little more; check out his finces, di't get anywhere.
took ten minutes. The easiest 500 bucks I ever made.
you should have dug deeper. -- Why?
I need the name of your client.
come on. It's privileged. -- Privileged?
are you a lawyer? 'Cause we're investigating a shooting here.
it will be no trouble for me to get a subpoena.
who got shot?
can't talk right now.
what happened? -- Give me a name.
the guy who hired me was Gordon Holcomb.
major Gordon Holcomb? -- Yeah.
think he was a marine.
doctor, he's coding.-- He's in V-fib.
I'm going to start compressions. -- Susan, bag him.
can I get the pads?
charge it up to 200.
200. Get those lines open.
okay, everybody, clear.
clear. -- Clear.
no response. Continue CPR.
I'm going to page Dr. Tallridge.
give EPI one milligram, IV ph.
one milligram.
Dr. Tallridge, please report to ICU, stat
wait, wait, wait. What happened with my husband?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mayne, but you need to stay here.
What...?
everybody, clear. -- Clear -- Clear. -- Clear.
he's not responding, Doctor.
we got asystole on the monitor.
no change.
we've lost him.
last month Major Holcomb res a P.I.to track down a guy he thought might be Lieutenant Mayne, but yesterday, he acts completely shocked when you tell him that Mayne is alive and here in DC.
as much as I was tnking one of the wives did it, this guy's looking awfully guilty.
and now that Mayne's died, guilty of murder.
see, Mayne went MIA Afghanistan, he was broke.
he was, in '02, making $3, 300 a month.
six years later, he's Wells, and he's worth over $12 million.
so, where did it all come from?
well, unfortunately, I can only trace the money back five years.
it was transferred from an offshore account in Neevis.
Nevis.
freeze all his accounts. -- You got it, boss.
it's dealer's choice. Some people say Nay-vis.
Nee-vis. Ne-vis. It's not really important.
what's your gut tell you on this?
that there's a connection with what went dow in Afghanistan six years ago.
you said Holcomb and Gontz said the exact same words to describe what happened?
like they were reading from a sipt.
check with our agents in Kabul. See what they can dig up.
got it, boss.
McGee. -- Security desk. We have a Major Holcomb for you.
uh, yeah. Be right down.
major Holcombis.
thank you for coming.
no problem.
gave up on the stakeout.
hope I helped. I didn't really tell you anything new.
you guys are really devious.
iger Investigations.
so, why'd you hire the P. I?
I was surfing the Internet.
came acrs a marathon.
thought the runner in that picture looked like John Mayne.
so I wondered, could he be alive?
you spent $500 of your own money to hire a private investigator.
you didn't mention that yesterday.
the investigator told me it wasn't him.
so, when you saw the photo, why didn't you call the police?
why didn't you call us?
look, I never came to terms with what happened on tt op in Afghanista one of my men was left behind.
I knew the chances of that runner in the photograph being Mayne was slim, so I did not want to dredge everything up with the Marine Corps again.
trust me. If that private eye told me Mayne was alive, I'd have come to you in a secd.
okay, yes.
something is amiss.
you are even more of a mystery than before, Lieutant Mayne.
so this is the little rascal I've heard so much about.
Mortimer, meet Dr. Mallard.
Hey, how about we set a playdate with your mom's corgis?
I mean, he needs to be socialized with other dog. -- We'll see.
did you match the slug from the lieutenant's body?
but there was definitely a second weapon, like Gibbs suspected.
well, I have an anomaly, too.
Gibbs told me that I should have found that one of his legs had been previously broken.
but that's definitely not the case.
what are you looking at?
your tie.
my neckwear seems to be a source of fascination.
do you like it?
Yes. But you're Ducky, and Ducky wears bow ties.
change, Abby, change.
the species must evolve and adapt.
tell me, Mortimer. They say that it makes me look younger.
you look adorable.
Hey, I'm gonna take Mortimer to lunch 'cause he needs to be exposed to restaurants.
I heard about this new vegan place. You want to join us?
uh, sorry. I-I can't.- How about tomorrow?
uh, I have something planned.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have to call Gibbs and tell him about the lack of a broken leg.
he's up to something, Moimer.
first, my husband's missing.
then I learn he's been shot.
you and the hospital won't let me see him. Now he's dead.
and you keep insisting he's someone he's not.
I know that this is hard for you to accept, but the man you married is really Lieutenant John Mayne.
you say that. I refuse to believe it.
before, we had a fingerprint ID.
now, we have a positive DNA match.
Oh, don't tell me they're releasing Christian's body to that woman.
ma'am, at this point, we're not planning to release his remains to anyone.
you know, this has become a total nightmare.
I tried to get cash out of the ATM this morning, and was denied.
I mean, the bank says they've frozen all of our accounts.
the man you married was leading a fraudulent life.
lieutenant Mayne's parents are still alive. There was no inheritance.
how am I supposed to live? Do I have to get my lawyer involved?
I don't know. You know what? You do whatever it is you need to do, okay?
special Agent Sanchez, please escort Miss Wells back down to the lobby.
this way, ma'am.
I'm not going away, Agent Gibbs.
What'd you find out?
about the time Mayne went MIA, an Afghan drug lord claimed some Americans stole millions from him.
maybe that's how poor Mayne became rich Wells.
his teammates were lying about him breaking his leg.
okay. Let's get them both back in. -- Hang on. Let's go to the cabdriver first.
he's the weak link. -- He is the weakest link.
and I am on it, boss.
uh... They told me John Mayne died.
um, why was he killed?
we think it had to do with his money.
he had money?
millions.
any idea how he got it?
no.
well... we think that it was stolen from this Afghan drug lord.
guy's been a guest at Gitmo for the past six years.
claims that he was robbed... by Americans.
come on, man.
what hpened on that op?
you help me, I'll he you.
our mission was to plant sensors. We did.
on the way out of the village, we took fire from his guards.
they thought we were after their money.
we took them down. And then we found it.
oil drums. Five of them.
full of cash, U.S. dollars.
me and Captain Holcomb left Mayne to guard the money while we went in search of a vehicle.
when we came back, he was gone.
so, when you were debriefed was when you made up the story about the broken leg?
we couldn't tell anyone about the money.
all these years, I have felt so guilty.
the lieutenant got captured because we wand that money.
and he's alive.
involved?
after Gordon returned from Afghanistan, came by the house to console me about John being MIA.
he would just check in on me every few months.
and then, three or four years ago, his marriage started to fall apart.
they changed between us, so...
when you came to the hospital to visited your husband, you made a phone call.
major Holcomb?
Yes, Leah Mayne called me from the hospital.
Yes, she told me John Mayne was alive before you brought me in.
you didn't tell us you hed a private investigator.
when are you going to stop lying?!
I was just trying protect my career and marriage.
now theye both over.
gordon stayed with his wife for his children's sake.
and you kept collecting your husband's Marine Corps pay and allowances?
Yes. -- You had no idea your husband was alive.
where were you that morning?
with Gordon.
I told my wife I had to spend the night in Quantico.
Leah and were in a hotel in Falls Church.
I know you don't have any reason to believe me, but we had no idea John Mayne was alive until you called her to the hospital.
their alibis are solid, boss.
this was filmed just minutes before John Mayne was shot in the park.
the major paid in cash. -- Of course he did. He's married and cell phone records confirm that they were both in Falls Church.
you were so quick to suspect the wife.
still do. He's got two of them and two lives.
which life got him killed?
I'm thinking it's the little hottie.
knew about her husband's former life and stolen money.
don't you think? I mean, she said she wasn't going running 'cause she had a bum hammy, but she was strutting around pretty good last time I saw her.
let's find out where she was.
what about Gontz, the cabdriver?
he was the thi man in Afghanistan.
maybe he found out Wells was Mayne and killed him for double-crossing them.
Oh, no. No. No more rain.
weatherman said it'd miss us.
what do you care about? A little rain's not going to hurt you.
it's going hurt my wallet. I just had my car washed.
that is why I never wash my car in the winter.
that's a big mistake. You got to wash off the deicing salt.
otherwise, it'll eat through the undercarriage.
can you track the cell phone number on this car and tell me where itas the morning Mayne was shot?
Peter Iger. Iger Iestigations. Sure.
Ziva. What's the matter with you?
he lied to me.
iger said he had not left the stakeout for three days.
but his car was spotless on the outside. I could see my reflection.
well, sorry, Ziva. Can't help you.
Iger's phone was turned off that morning.
I do not believe it. He is always on it.
the man practically has a wire growing out of his ear.
he would never turn it off, Gibbs.
unless he didn't want to leave an electronic trail.
hang on a second. His phone on now?
uh, yes, it is.
where?
not far from here. 1200 block of M Street Northwest.
he's not here.
he's got to be around here somewhere. I'm gonna call Ziva.
what did Iger say?
uh, Iger's not here. Listen, could you go to my desk?
there's a cell tracker with Iger's phone it.
just, uh, tell me where he is.
there is a laptop in the, uh, passenger seat there.
I'd love to get a look.
well, his phone is now north of M Street on Ridge.
address indicates it is a restaurant.
all right. He's, uh, a block up, around the corner. He's eating.
perfect. I'll get the Slim Jim.
no. What? We don't have a warrant.
and I have a record, and besides, a Slim Jim is very...It's very old school.
you got a better idea?
matter of fact, I do.
Ziva? I'm gonna put you on hold for one second.
uh, stay on the line, though.
I built an application for my phone.
why is that important to what we're doing here?
with a vehicle's VIN number, you can access all the vehicle's pertinent information, including key and remote code.
download all the codes, and there it is.
well, I'm glad that MIT education paid off for something, McGee.
it is pretty super, isn't it? -- I don't believe you.
well, I don't think you could unlock the door.
cause if you could, u'd prove it to me by doing it.
uh, no, it does. No.
mine!
no, uh, Tony.
you should patent that.
Ziva, where is he now?
he has not moved.
what are they up to?
how do I get into his fil?
Tony, you can't.
you know what? You're right.
you could get in here in ten seconds.
and then we'd be out of here.
come on. I'll hold the phone.
all right. All right, files are listed by clients' names.
major Gordon Holcomb.
all right. Done. Give me this.
I want no more part of this.
thank you very much.
Ah, it's exactly what you asked for.
they called me last night to tell me it was here.
you should be very pleased.
I missed you at the opera last night, Mother.
Madame Butterfly. All those melodies.
one after the other. It never ceases to amaze me.
when did she die?
Ah, Ducky, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
this is interesting.
it's an e-mail from a private lab in Philadelphia.
listen to this.
as you suspected,we have matched the left thumb and index finger on the water bottle you sent us to First Lieutenant John Mayne, USMC
so, the P. I. knew Wells was Mayne.
Ziva, uh... check with the ATF database.
see if Iger has a registered . 45.
are you going to tell me what's going on, McGee, or is this, like, a guy thing?
Yeah. Later, later.
why would Iger withhold that information from his client?
because if he tells his client, he only gets the fee, which is a couple hundred bucks.
but if he withholds the information, uses it to blackmail Mayne, who is worth millions?
McGee? -- Yeah?
iger owns a Smith & Wesson 4.5.
great. Okay. Uh, thanks, Ziva. Don't go away.
you know, it's too bad we won't be able to use any of this information, 'cause you broke into the car, and then obtained it illegal from his computer.
criminal.
Yeah.
McGee, Iger's coming your way.
you better get out of there.
well, what can I tell you?
I charge $100 an hour plus expenses.
Yeah. You got my number, pal.
NCIS, right?
Yep.
you guys making any headway?
well, as matter of fact, we wanted to ask you a few questions.
sure. Whatever I can do.
well, according to, uh, ATF records, you have a permit to carry a 4.5.
can we see your weapon?
I... I hav't carried it in years.
I, uh, I sold it at a gun show.
Oh, well. That's good.
how about you put the bag down...
where do you think you're going? -- All right, all right. Come on.
you don't have to do this.
all right.
so, did you try to shake Wells down?
meeting in the park went bad, didn't it?
it was self-defense.
he had a gun. He shot first.
the guy stole millions. I only asked for 100 grand.
when were you going to tell me, Doc?
soon.
I thought about having a service, but all of mother's friends predeceased her.
I was all she had.
okay. So, why keep it yourself?
I-I didn't want to impose.
I'm surrounded by death, Jethro.
I wanted to deal with the personal loss by myself.
did you know that she was almost 100?
and she had an active, full life, but this last year, she has not been herself.
it was her time.
the natural progression of age.
you going to stay in the house?
the sale is pending. We should close next week.
Ooh, those wretched little dogs?
I found a good home for them with a corgi lover in Virginia.
what are you going to do?
I've put down an offer on a brownstone in Georgetown.
It'sn the Historic Registry.
I've been working with a charming real estate agent.
her name is Sophie.
she's... quite a bit younger than myself.
so, I take it, Sophie's the one that doesn't like the bow ties?
well...
speaking of rain, the weatherman tells us the rains are going to continue to fall for the rest of the week.
what, dear? -- You need to apologize to Mom.
no, I will not apologize to your mother.
she's going to leave. -- Well, good. Let her go home.
will?! What was that?! What...?! -- Can't talk.
what the hell?
hold it right there!
Jethro working you so hard you have to do your laundry at the office?
stepped in a puddle.
he did not watch where he was walking.
he was texting. -- Me.
Tony thinks "Probationary Agent" means that I'm his personal assistant.
he wanted me to pick up his latte.
I was running late. -- That is your problem.
I hate rain. -- I love it.
I mean, rain is so invigorating, cleansing.
it make the air fresh and the city sparkle.
where is Jethro?
I have no idea.
um, I think he's in the building somewhere.
well, it can wait.
does anyone have any talc? This hurts.
would you just take your foot to the locker room, please?
any of you notice something different about Ducky?
Yeah, he has seemed awfully chipper as of late.
Ducky does seem plucky.
no one loves rain in DC.
no. His ties.
he's been wearing tie ties, not his bow ties.
Oh, that's very observant.
boss, hey, uh, Ducky was looking for you.
what's he want?
uh, don't know, but he left something for you on your desk.
let's go. Marine, shot. Rock Creek Park.
Oh, thanks, boss. Are these clean?
of course they are.
we searched the area.
found a nine-millimeter.
Yeah, looky there.
the FBI ERT, they removed a slug from the vehicle.
well, good luck finding any more.
Yeah, a lot of muddy footprints.
nothing that could be lifted.
well, get all the evidence. Collect it back to our lab, will you?
Hey, that's between you and the FBI.
we're not getting in the middle of that.
when did the Bureau get involved?
well, we called them in to assist with the ballistics.
you find anything on the victim?
just what looked like a house key. It was tied to his shoelaces.
Really? Then how did you ID Lieutenant Mayne?
mobile fingerprint scanner.
don't you guys use them?
well, I mean, they... they're coming. They just haven't quite been issued yet.
can I give it a go?
Yeah. All right. Just put your thumb on the screen.
Oh, hey, boss. How's he doing?
still in surgery.
park police, FBI can clean up here. Let's get to the hospital.
Timothy-- no middle name-- McGee.
you broke into a Metro PD impound yard?
what's the matter with you?
boss, that was supposed to be expunged.
run Mayne's service record. Notify next of kin.
if you need me.
Leah Mayne, lives in Woodley Park.
Oh, that's strange.
what now, McGee?
there must be something wrong with your fingerprint scanner.
according to his service record, Lieutenant Mayne is MIA. Went missing in Afghanistan six years ago.
Dr. Bailey, Post-Op.
page me if there's any change. -- Yes, Doctor.
when can we talk with him?
I don't know. One bullet grazed his forehead. The other went deep into his lower left abdomen.
he's lost a lot of blood. The slug is imbedded close to his spine.
it, uh, would be far too dangerous to remove at this time.
Ruth, will you keep his IV at 75cc's per hour?
Yes, Doctor. -- Thank you.
I'll let you know if there's any changes, Agent Gibbs.
this is surreal.
I mean... After all these years, not even a word.
I just assumed that my husband was dead and...and now you're telling me that he's alive and that he's living in Washington, DC, but he's been shot.
I mean, are you sure that it was John?
we have a fingerprint match, but we'd like you to make a visual identification.
you okay with that?
Yeah. -- Okay.
Dr. Ollie, Nuclear Medicine.
um, it looks like him.
the last time I saw John, he was... clean-shaven and he had a Marine buzz cut.
Oh, he had a birthmark on his...
hang on. Hold on. -- Oh, sorry.
nurse, please.
Brownish, circular?
it's John.
where has he been the last six years?
I don't know, but we're going to find out.
you need a minute?
thank you.
okay. Stay here.
if he regains consciousness, call me, and see if you can get any more out of her.
you subscribing to the DiNozzo Theory-- always suspect the wife?
I'm at the hospital... Do you know of any of his friends...?
okay. What do we got?
six years ago, Lieutenant Mayne was part of a three-man deep cover recon mission in Afghanistan.
he went missing.
all right. Thanks very much. -- The other two team members were Captain Gordon Holcomb and Sergeant Matthew Gontz.
Holcomb's still in the military. He's a major now, stationed in Quantico.
he's coming in tomorrow morning.
Gontz was honorably discharged five years ago.
still haven't found him, though we do know that he went through a divorce and a series of jobs.
I think he's having a little trouble adjusting to civilian life.
well, I am going to try and track him down through Social Security Administration.
Oh, you're a thirsty little boy.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
Yeah, we're gonna get you some water and some food and love.
what's the dog doing here?
Gibbs, this is Mortimer.
what's he doing here?
I am an SVPR.
a substitute volunteer puppy raiser.
Mortimer here is going to be a Seeing Eye dog one day and you're going to be the smartest boy in your whole class.
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
okay, putting dog down now.
okay, so, uh... The gun.
it is... unregistered, and has only Lieutenant Mayne's prints on it.
as you can see, it is a nine-millimeter.
there were two shots fired, and 13 remain in the magazine.
the slug that FBI ERT pulled from the vehicle?
it's too mangled to match, but it's definitely bigger than a nine.
Ducky talked to the doctor.
Mayne's wounds weren't self-inflicted.
looks like a shoot-out.
Hey, what's going on with Ducky? He's acting very un-Ducky-like.
like-like every day, he leaves during lunch.
he's never done that before.
I mean, the Duck Man is a creature of habit. He brings in his lunch.
he eats at his desk.
where is he going? -- I'm sure he's fine.
uh, Abby, don't let that dog out of your sight.
that's not your bone.
excuse me, uh, Matthew Gontz?
Matthew Gontz? - Yeah?
NCIS. May we speak with you?
what's this about?
I've been out of the Marine Corps for years.
Yeah, we know. You've been hard to track down.
uh, we need to ask about a reconnaissance mission.
the one where Lieutenant Mayne went missing.
you know I've told that story a hundred times?
well, we need to hear it for ourselves.
it was just the three of us.
me, Captain Holcomb, Lieutenant Mayne.
we were inserted into a hostile environment.
it was a keyhole mission. Defensive weapons only.
am I cleared to tell you guys this stuff? This was classified.
we've been read into the program.
our mission was to place and recover remote target sensors in Mazar-e.
everything went according to plan until we made for the exit rendezvous.
that's when Lieutenant Mayne broke his leg.
how did it happen?
we were coming over a wall in a small village just outside of town.
he snagged his KA-BAR sheath on some barbed wire, and he fell.
it wasn't his day.
did you leave him behind?
no. Captain Holcomb and myself stashed him in the basement of an abandoned building while we went to commandeer a vehicle.
when we came back, he wasn't there. We assumed he was captured.
so you and Captain Holcomb went to the exit rendezvous?
we had to. We followed mission protocol.
look, I've never forgiven myself for leaving a team member behind.
must be tough.
the Marine Corps tore the country upside down looking for Mayne.
look, are we done? I gotta clock in.
for now.
wait. Um... why's all this coming up again?
John Mayne is no longer MIA.
he showed up yesterday morning.
he was shot.
I don't believe it.
Where'd it happen?
right here in DC.
you have any indication he was alive over the past six years?
the last time saw him was in Mazar-e. His KA-BAR sheath got snagged on some barbwire.
he broke his leg.
just wasn't his day.
Yeah, Gibbs. -- Boss, Lieutenant Mayne's awake.
be right there.
did you have any contact with Sergeant Gontz since Afghanistan?
no. The mission rely shook him badly.
I lost track with him after he got dischard.
has he been told Mayne's alive?
Yes, he has.
two milligrams of flurazepam. Call me if there's any changes, okay?
just keep me posted. Thank you. -- You're welcome.
he's conscious, which is a good sign, but he's incoherent.
worst thing for him right now is to be bombarded with questions.
I'm gonna keep him sedated.
for how long?
it's too early to tell.
Specl Agent Gibbs... My name's Rachel Wells.
I was told by police to see you.
about what?
my husband.
he went joggingyesterda, never returned home.
when I reported him missing and showed his picture to police, You're married to John Mayne?
no -- He's name was john Mayne?
no, his name's Christian Wells.
no, his name is John, and he's my husband.
I met Christian two years ago. -- Thanks.
on a tck at Georgetown. Thanks.
we're both runners.
we, um, smiled and nodded for about a month, and then went for coffee, then started dating.
how long you been married?
just over a year.
last Christmas in Hawaii, we eloped.
you met his family?
he doesn't have any family.
Christian's an only child and both his parents are dead.
but you're probably gonna tell me that-that's not true either.
his name's John Mayne.
he went MIA in Afghanistan six years ago.
your husband have a job?
he day-trades, manages his portfolio.
christian inherited a lot of money, so...
I mean that's not why I married him.
you're a runner, right?
Yeah.
how come the two of you didn't go running yesterday morning together?
I've been nursing a hamstring.
you know, I should probably get back upstairs to my husband.
you know he was meeting someone in the park yesterday?
no. -- Do you know he owned a gun?
he had it with him.
the district does not take fingerprints when issuing a driver's license.
that is why Christian Wells' name does not come up on the SCA
the records reflect his arrival in the Virginia-Maryland area five years ago.
nothing prior. Lieutenant Mayne obviously constructed a new life.
I found a whole lot of bank and brokerage accounts in Christian Wells' name.
look at that, boss.
this one mutual account alone, he has over $5 million in.
with what I found so far, his net worth is over $12 million. -- Where'd the money come from?
uh, don't know yet, but we are not the only ones checking him out.
the last two weeks, someone ran multiple credit checks on Wells.
you got a name?
I do. Peter Iger of Iger Investigations.
he's a P.I. I got the voice mail, left a message.
good. Keep working the source of the money.
Ziva, track down Iger.
Yeah. Keep the IV. Call me with an update in an hour.
can I talk to him now? -- Absolutely not.
he seems coherent.
barely. Just a couple of questions, Doc.
I'm sorry. He's not out of the woods yet. I dot want him upset.
have you informed the wife of his condition?
which one?
it's quite a dilemma, isn't it?
Dr. Tallridge, I've waited long enough. I'd like to see my husband now.
ma'am, I was just telling Agent DiNozz that your husband is still in critical condition.
if I let you into his room... -- No, no, no.
if you let that bimbo into my husband's room,
I will sue this hospital and you personally for everything that you've got.
you ever been married, Doc?
twice, but never at the same time.
dark SUV. -- Got it.
I'll be here... -- I'll be there as soon as I can. Thank you.
iger the P.I? -- Yeah.
nice tie. --Ah, thank you.
I found it at the Metropolitan Museum of Art store in w York.
its design is based on the Golden Hoard of Bactria, unearthed from the tombs of Tillya-tepe in northern Afanistan.
well, I like the flowers... Gotta go.
Oh, hey-ho.- You looking for this?
Ah, you did sign it. Thank you.
Yeah. Where you going?
I just need some personal time.
a long weekend will suffice.
if anything comes up, Mr. Palmer can deal with it.
if you need me, I'm reachable on my cell phone.
duck, everything okay?
Yeah, never better.
half my team's worried about you.
let me guess.
which half?
Abby and Ziva.
ICU tech, please report to the east wing nurses' station.
rise and shine, sleepyhead.
how you feeling?
I've felt better.
who are you?
that's a good estion. I can see you're thinking clearly.
I'm Anthony DiNozzo, Special Agent with NCIS.
like to ask you a couple of questions, Lieutenant Mayne.
bet you haven't heard at name in, what, six years?
listen, I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
is it better if call you "Christian Wells"?
Ooh, that got a response.
I don't know what you're talking about. -- Maybe you're right.
maybe I'm just a little confused.
I wouldn't be the only one. Got two women out in the waiting room.
both of them claim to be your wife.
where did you go after Afghanistan?
what are you doing in here?! You're not supposed to be in here!
I was trying to fluff his pillow. He looked uncomfortable.
you know what? Out! -- What?
out, out! - Listen, I didn't do anything.
you should know better. -- Everything's fine.
she just, you know, I went by... There's not a problem.
I just wanted to check on him, ask him a few questions.
what do you mean where am I?
Yeah, well, I'm not happy about it either.
well, what dyou want me to do, work miracles?
I'm still parked in front of her place.
Yeah, yeah.
no, he still hasn't shown.
hold on a second.
agent David?-- Dav-eed.
look, I'll call you the second I see him.
then e-mail it to me, Joey. I'll take a look.
thanks for meeting me here.
I haven't left this spot in three days.
hmm, stakeouts are brutal.
so, uh, what do you need?
why were you investigating Christian Wells?
come on. We know you ran credit checks on him.
Yeah. -- Why?
client hired me.
sorry. Not him.
so who hired you to find out about Wells?
guy had a Internet photo of a marathon runner crossing the finish line, thought it was somebody he knew.
I ran his registration number through the marathon's database.
runner's name was Christian Wes. He's not theerson the client was looking for.
I tried to do a little more; check out his finces, di't get anywhere.
took ten minutes. The easiest 500 bucks I ever made.
you should have dug deeper. -- Why?
I need the name of your client.
come on. It's privileged. -- Privileged?
are you a lawyer? 'Cause we're investigating a shooting here.
it will be no trouble for me to get a subpoena.
who got shot?
can't talk right now.
what happened? -- Give me a name.
the guy who hired me was Gordon Holcomb.
major Gordon Holcomb? -- Yeah.
think he was a marine.
doctor, he's coding.-- He's in V-fib.
I'm going to start compressions. -- Susan, bag him.
can I get the pads?
charge it up to 200.
200. Get those lines open.
okay, everybody, clear.
clear. -- Clear.
no response. Continue CPR.
I'm going to page Dr. Tallridge.
give EPI one milligram, IV ph.
one milligram.
Dr. Tallridge, please report to ICU, stat
wait, wait, wait. What happened with my husband?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mayne, but you need to stay here.
What...?
everybody, clear. -- Clear -- Clear. -- Clear.
he's not responding, Doctor.
we got asystole on the monitor.
no change.
we've lost him.
last month Major Holcomb res a P.I.to track down a guy he thought might be Lieutenant Mayne, but yesterday, he acts completely shocked when you tell him that Mayne is alive and here in DC.
as much as I was tnking one of the wives did it, this guy's looking awfully guilty.
and now that Mayne's died, guilty of murder.
see, Mayne went MIA Afghanistan, he was broke.
he was, in '02, making $3, 300 a month.
six years later, he's Wells, and he's worth over $12 million.
so, where did it all come from?
well, unfortunately, I can only trace the money back five years.
it was transferred from an offshore account in Neevis.
Nevis.
freeze all his accounts. -- You got it, boss.
it's dealer's choice. Some people say Nay-vis.
Nee-vis. Ne-vis. It's not really important.
what's your gut tell you on this?
that there's a connection with what went dow in Afghanistan six years ago.
you said Holcomb and Gontz said the exact same words to describe what happened?
like they were reading from a sipt.
check with our agents in Kabul. See what they can dig up.
got it, boss.
McGee. -- Security desk. We have a Major Holcomb for you.
uh, yeah. Be right down.
major Holcombis.
thank you for coming.
no problem.
gave up on the stakeout.
hope I helped. I didn't really tell you anything new.
you guys are really devious.
iger Investigations.
so, why'd you hire the P. I?
I was surfing the Internet.
came acrs a marathon.
thought the runner in that picture looked like John Mayne.
so I wondered, could he be alive?
you spent $500 of your own money to hire a private investigator.
you didn't mention that yesterday.
the investigator told me it wasn't him.
so, when you saw the photo, why didn't you call the police?
why didn't you call us?
look, I never came to terms with what happened on tt op in Afghanista one of my men was left behind.
I knew the chances of that runner in the photograph being Mayne was slim, so I did not want to dredge everything up with the Marine Corps again.
trust me. If that private eye told me Mayne was alive, I'd have come to you in a secd.
okay, yes.
something is amiss.
you are even more of a mystery than before, Lieutant Mayne.
so this is the little rascal I've heard so much about.
Mortimer, meet Dr. Mallard.
Hey, how about we set a playdate with your mom's corgis?
I mean, he needs to be socialized with other dog. -- We'll see.
did you match the slug from the lieutenant's body?
but there was definitely a second weapon, like Gibbs suspected.
it was a . 45. The gun they found at the crime scene was a nine-mil.
well, I have an anomaly, too.
Gibbs told me that I should have found that one of his legs had been previously broken.
but that's definitely not the case.
what are you looking at?
your tie.
my neckwear seems to be a source of fascination.
do you like it?
Yes. But you're Ducky, and Ducky wears bow ties.
change, Abby, change.
the species must evolve and adapt.
tell me, Mortimer. They say that it makes me look younger.
you look adorable.
Hey, I'm gonna take Mortimer to lunch 'cause he needs to be exposed to restaurants.
I heard about this new vegan place. You want to join us?
uh, sorry. I-I can't.- How about tomorrow?
uh, I have something planned.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have to call Gibbs and tell him about the lack of a broken leg.
he's up to something, Moimer.
first, my husband's missing.
then I learn he's been shot.
you and the hospital won't let me see him. Now he's dead.
and you keep insisting he's someone he's not.
I know that this is hard for you to accept, but the man you married is really Lieutenant John Mayne.
you say that. I refuse to believe it.
before, we had a fingerprint ID.
now, we have a positive DNA match.
Oh, don't tell me they're releasing Christian's body to that woman.
ma'am, at this point, we're not planning to release his remains to anyone.
you know, this has become a total nightmare.
I tried to get cash out of the ATM this morning, and was denied.
I mean, the bank says they've frozen all of our accounts.
the man you married was leading a fraudulent life.
lieutenant Mayne's parents are still alive. There was no inheritance.
how am I supposed to live? Do I have to get my lawyer involved?
I don't know. You know what? You do whatever it is you need to do, okay?
special Agent Sanchez, please escort Miss Wells back down to the lobby.
this way, ma'am.
I'm not going away, Agent Gibbs.
What'd you find out?
about the time Mayne went MIA, an Afghan drug lord claimed some Americans stole millions from him.
maybe that's how poor Mayne became rich Wells.
his teammates were lying about him breaking his leg.
okay. Let's get them both back in. -- Hang on. Let's go to the cabdriver first.
he's the weak link. -- He is the weakest link.
and I am on it, boss.
uh... They told me John Mayne died.
um, why was he killed?
we think it had to do with his money.
he had money?
millions.
any idea how he got it?
no.
well... we think that it was stolen from this Afghan drug lord.
guy's been a guest at Gitmo for the past six years.
claims that he was robbed... by Americans.
come on, man.
what hpened on that op?
you help me, I'll he you.
our mission was to plant sensors. We did.
on the way out of the village, we took fire from his guards.
they thought we were after their money.
we took them down. And then we found it.
oil drums. Five of them.
full of cash, U.S. dollars.
me and Captain Holcomb left Mayne to guard the money while we went in search of a vehicle.
when we came back, he was gone.
so, when you were debriefed was when you made up the story about the broken leg?
we couldn't tell anyone about the money.
all these years, I have felt so guilty.
the lieutenant got captured because we wand that money.
and he's alive.
involved?
after Gordon returned from Afghanistan, came by the house to console me about John being MIA.
he would just check in on me every few months.
and then, three or four years ago, his marriage started to fall apart.
they changed between us, so...
when you came to the hospital to visited your husband, you made a phone call.
major Holcomb?
Yes, Leah Mayne called me from the hospital.
Yes, she told me John Mayne was alive before you brought me in.
you didn't tell us you hed a private investigator.
when are you going to stop lying?!
I was just trying protect my career and marriage.
now theye both over.
gordon stayed with his wife for his children's sake.
and you kept collecting your husband's Marine Corps pay and allowances?
Yes. -- You had no idea your husband was alive.
where were you that morning?
with Gordon.
I told my wife I had to spend the night in Quantico.
Leah and were in a hotel in Falls Church.
I know you don't have any reason to believe me, but we had no idea John Mayne was alive until you called her to the hospital.
their alibis are solid, boss.
this was filmed just minutes before John Mayne was shot in the park.
the major paid in cash. -- Of course he did. He's married and cell phone records confirm that they were both in Falls Church.
you were so quick to suspect the wife.
still do. He's got two of them and two lives.
which life got him killed?
I'm thinking it's the little hottie.
knew about her husband's former life and stolen money.
don't you think? I mean, she said she wasn't going running 'cause she had a bum hammy, but she was strutting around pretty good last time I saw her.
let's find out where she was.
what about Gontz, the cabdriver?
he was the thi man in Afghanistan.
maybe he found out Wells was Mayne and killed him for double-crossing them.
Oh, no. No. No more rain.
weatherman said it'd miss us.
what do you care about? A little rain's not going to hurt you.
it's going hurt my wallet. I just had my car washed.
that is why I never wash my car in the winter.
that's a big mistake. You got to wash off the deicing salt.
otherwise, it'll eat through the undercarriage.
can you track the cell phone number on this car and tell me where itas the morning Mayne was shot?
Peter Iger. Iger Iestigations. Sure.
Ziva. What's the matter with you?
he lied to me.
iger said he had not left the stakeout for three days.
but his car was spotless on the outside. I could see my reflection.
well, sorry, Ziva. Can't help you.
Iger's phone was turned off that morning.
I do not believe it. He is always on it.
the man practically has a wire growing out of his ear.
he would never turn it off, Gibbs.
unless he didn't want to leave an electronic trail.
hang on a second. His phone on now?
uh, yes, it is.
where?
not far from here. 1200 block of M Street Northwest.
he's not here.
he's got to be around here somewhere. I'm gonna call Ziva.
what did Iger say?
uh, Iger's not here. Listen, could you go to my desk?
there's a cell tracker with Iger's phone it.
just, uh, tell me where he is.
there is a laptop in the, uh, passenger seat there.
I'd love to get a look.
well, his phone is now north of M Street on Ridge.
address indicates it is a restaurant.
all right. He's, uh, a block up, around the corner. He's eating.
perfect. I'll get the Slim Jim.
no. What? We don't have a warrant.
and I have a record, and besides, a Slim Jim is very...It's very old school.
you got a better idea?
matter of fact, I do.
Ziva? I'm gonna put you on hold for one second.
uh, stay on the line, though.
I built an application for my phone.
why is that important to what we're doing here?
with a vehicle's VIN number, you can access all the vehicle's pertinent information, including key and remote code.
download all the codes, and there it is.
well, I'm glad that MIT education paid off for something, McGee.
it is pretty super, isn't it? -- I don't believe you.
well, I don't think you could unlock the door.
cause if you could, u'd prove it to me by doing it.
uh, no, it does. No.
mine!
no, uh, Tony.
you should patent that.
Ziva, where is he now?
he has not moved.
what are they up to?
how do I get into his fil?
Tony, you can't.
you know what? You're right.
you could get in here in ten seconds.
and then we'd be out of here.
come on. I'll hold the phone.
all right. All right, files are listed by clients' names.
major Gordon Holcomb.
all right. Done. Give me this.
I want no more part of this.
thank you very much.
Ah, it's exactly what you asked for.
they called me last night to tell me it was here.
you should be very pleased.
I missed you at the opera last night, Mother.
Madame Butterfly. All those melodies.
one after the other. It never ceases to amaze me.
when did she die?
Ah, Ducky, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
this is interesting.
it's an e-mail from a private lab in Philadelphia.
listen to this.
as you suspected,we have matched the left thumb and index finger on the water bottle you sent us to First Lieutenant John Mayne, USMC
so, the P. I. knew Wells was Mayne.
Ziva, uh... check with the ATF database.
see if Iger has a registered . 45.
are you going to tell me what's going on, McGee, or is this, like, a guy thing?
Yeah. Later, later.
why would Iger withhold that information from his client?
because if he tells his client, he only gets the fee, which is a couple hundred bucks.
but if he withholds the information, uses it to blackmail Mayne, who is worth millions?
McGee? -- Yeah?
iger owns a Smith & Wesson 4.5.
great. Okay. Uh, thanks, Ziva. Don't go away.
you know, it's too bad we won't be able to use any of this information, 'cause you broke into the car, and then obtained it illegal from his computer.
criminal.
Yeah.
McGee, Iger's coming your way.
you better get out of there.
well, what can I tell you?
I charge $100 an hour plus expenses.
Yeah. You got my number, pal.
NCIS, right?
Yep.
you guys making any headway?
well, as matter of fact, we wanted to ask you a few questions.
sure. Whatever I can do.
well, according to, uh, ATF records, you have a permit to carry a 4.5.
can we see your weapon?
I... I hav't carried it in years.
I, uh, I sold it at a gun show.
Oh, well. That's good.
how about you put the bag down...
where do you think you're going? -- All right, all right. Come on.
you don't have to do this.
all right.
so, did you try to shake Wells down?
meeting in the park went bad, didn't it?
it was self-defense.
he had a gun. He shot first.
the guy stole millions. I only asked for 100 grand.
when were you going to tell me, Doc?
soon.
I thought about having a service, but all of mother's friends predeceased her.
I was all she had.
okay. So, why keep it yourself?
I-I didn't want to impose.
I'm surrounded by death, Jethro.
I wanted to deal with the personal loss by myself.
did you know that she was almost 100?
and she had an active, full life, but this last year, she has not been herself.
it was her time.
the natural progression of age.
you going to stay in the house?
the sale is pending. We should close next week.
Ooh, those wretched little dogs?
I found a good home for them with a corgi lover in Virginia.
what are you going to do?
I've put down an offer on a brownstone in Georgetown.
It'sn the Historic Registry.
I've been working with a charming real estate agent.
her name is Sophie.
she's... quite a bit younger than myself.
so, I take it, Sophie's the one that doesn't like the bow ties?
well...
what's an NCIS agent doing so far from home?
I'm teaching a class on the forensics of cold cases.
we're using the murder of a man named Pedro Hernandez as a case study.
I need to exhume the body of Pedro Hernandez.
the body of a drug dealer from 20 years ago?
I don't think anyone will mind.
I have it.
the evidence in my report says that you killed Pedro Hernandez.
I mean, I know he killed your wife and your daughter.
tell me what your patriot Bell is up to.
he's been accumulating information on Special Agent Gibbs.
where is he?
last I heard he was headed back down to Mexico.
I need you to get a message to Mike for me.
the message is: Rule number 44.
Oh, Mike.
that ain't Franks.
who is it? - Colonel Merton Bell.
Colonel Bell wanted to prove he was a better man than you.
he and his men made for a useful ally, but they were a means to an end.
then you might as well put a bullet in my head right now, because you're not gonna get anything.
well, does he have your precious report?
no. - Brother and sister.
but I never lost a night's sleep over your father.
this is the bullet that should end you.
do you think I want that?
what's your assignment here?
director's orders. Observe and report.
if I must... I promise to personally visit Pennsylvaniaand shoot your father in the head...
can I help you?
Yes, MrGibbs.
I think you can.
now, ma'am... you need to go.
but we have so much to talk about.
from what I hear, you didn't come to talk.
you are just like your son.
no, ma'am.
he's just like me.
how confident are you...
Mr. Gibbs?
I was raised on a farm.
used to play chicken in my daddy's truck every Saturday night.
this ain't much different.
Mtalo. Ahora.
find him.
he is gone.
I thought we'd try some ham today.
I hope those eggs aren't overcooked.
you don't have to make breakfast for me every day, Dad.
breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
gets your batteries charged.
mom used to say that.
thought I'd do some errands today.
fix that faucet upstairs.
anything you need?
no.
wish you'd take the agents with you.
do I really need those guys?
they're good men, Dad.
I've been living in this house under lock and key for months now.
they've never done a damn thing.
you're lucky you're not dead.
I'm lucky there was a storm cellar I could hide out in.
son...
I want to go home. It's time.
when it's safe.
watching it again is not gonna change anything.
it was a trap.
Yep. - Now look.
Rivera gives the signal.
all hell breaks loose.
he knew we were following him. We walked right into it.
let it go, DiNozzo.
any word from Franks?
sorry, boss. Observe and report.
director's orders.
it's hard to observe when you're being shot at.
think Vance is still angry with me?
what do you think?
morning, sir. We were just discussing our continued effort to locate Paloma Reynosa.
And?
how about those Washington Nationals, sir?
I just got off the phone with SECNAV.
he wants to know why NCIS can't successfully orchestrate a manhunt for one female drug dealer.
it's Mexico.
what's to say she hasn't already crossed the border?
my gut.
the DEA wants to step in.
however, I'd like to save face.
and despite Sir Rivera's family ties, the Mexican government has opted to keep him in a position of authority.
the government's got their hands full these days.
I guess the Reynosas have paid off the right people.
Yeah, or killed them.
status report.
Ziva's following a lead in Miami, a Cuban tie-in.
agent McGee.
at the Canadian border.
this is starting to impact our workload.
Paloma could be anywhere in the world by now.
Yeah, Leon, or she could be across the street.
dead reservist. Check it.
saddle up, DiNozzo.
we're not going to Arizona, are we?
west Virginia.
spectacular.
are those the Blue Ridge Mountains?
Shenandoah River's not far.
thank God I'm a country lad!
country boy," Ducky.
for an emergency landing, this helicopter's surprisingly intact.
landing's not what killed them.
them? As in more than one them?
captain John McMahon, owned and piloted the charter service.
around 2: 00 a. m. this morning, he was in the middle of a job when he, uh, reported mechanical trouble.
then he made a Mayday and set her down here.
that was the last anybody heard from him.
based on the blood flow pattern, the real trouble wasn't midair.
the captain was shot here on the ground.
got another gunshot wound over here, Doctor.
there's a nine-millimeter casing in the grass, boss.
45 next to the pilot.
wait, they shot each other?
you got a passenger manifest?
no, sir. No route logged, either.
middle of the night, somebody hired this guy on the QT.
so, after the Mayday, the passenger couldn't risk talking to the police, so he shot McMahon.
he didn't expect him to shoot back.
wait a minute, where are the guns?
Holster's empty.
eye in the sky. - Record his flights.
must've had more than a few bad customers.
that's her.
doc, got a time a death?
approximately... nine hours ago.
hell of a lead time.
DiNozzo, local airports on alert.
call Vance. Tell him we need agents at the state border.
where do you figure Ms. Reynosa's headed, Jethro?
I don't know, Duck.
but I'd sure like to get there first.
well, you know, West Virginia has five bordering states, boss.
giving out geography lessons now, are you, DiNozzo?
I'm just saying that's a lot of land to cover.
get Ziva back from Miami; tell McGee the chopper was heading north when it went down.
north as in Canada?
Yeah, maybe.
that horse likes you.
this isn't funny, Tony.
Oh, poor McMountie.
Hey, so have you seen any, like, moose and stuff up there?
Hey, uh, where's your buddy, Claude?
isn't that your friendly St. Bernard with the little barrel of whiskey under his chin?
look, I've been up here playing Dudley Do-Right for two weeks, okay?
it's September, and there's snow on the ground.
would you at least give me a little compassion here?
and what would that be for, huh?
did you forget to take off your toque when you entered a room?
you're gonna get in trouble up there-- hanging with the blue-necks, throwing back a two-four of pale ale...
I've actually been working, unlike certain people.
certain people here are working, McGee.
uh, of course, boss.
Paloma Reynosa was in a chopper headed up the coast-- any idea why?
well, DEA and Mounties narc division shut down a border exchange yesterday.
the product was from Mexico and had potential ties to the Reynosa cartel.
so Paloma could've been headed there to seal the deal?
if the copter hadn't gone down, we might've gotten her.
boss, can I please come home?
nice horse, Tim.
boss?
Mr. Palmer, did you ever visit the paradise that is Turks and Caicos?
no, but I did drive down to the Florida Keys once, and I had the most delicious key lime pie at this little shack right there on U. S. 1.
I swear, the meringue had the appearance of nimbus clouds.
and... 
I'm sorry. Uh, you were saying?
well, as a boy, my parents used to refer to the region as the British West Indies.
but never in my life have I encountered insects as unique to a locale as there.
uh, so you are reminiscing based on the bug bites on Estaban Lopez.
Reynosa's friend here had no idea what he was into, traveling with her.
his dermis is a veritable road map of entomological reactions, and that, combined with the contents of his stomach...
I am sure we can ascertain their various destinations.
so you can actually tell the difference between these bug bites?
of course, Mr. Palmer.
Yeah, the Everglades are home to 43 species of mosquito alone.
Yeah, and don't get me started on South Carolina's velvet ant.
now, then, I'll run the gut while you get that up to Abby for analysis.
Yes, perhaps our friend Estaban here can not only help us find his previous employer, he can tell us where she's been.
definitely not now, Dad.
Hello, Tony. I'm back.
well, hello, Little Miss Sunshine State, and don't you look balmy?
I do not know what "balmy" means, but I will assume it is not good.
well, just because I was alone manning the fort, handling Gibbs solo while you've been strolling around South Beach, dancing to the rhythm of the night...
...why would I feel the need to say anything negative?
because you are you.
besides, I was working the entire time.
ha. - Ha, what?
working.
are those tan lines?
where do you think you're looking?
does it even matter?
well, actually, yes, it does, and I can assure you I do not have any tan lines.
Oh, so you did lay in the sun?
Yes, I did, actually, this morning before my flight, and I came up with something case-related prior to my departure.
hmm, you smell like ocean and shea butter.
a local Dade County informant said that a Mexican drug shipment recently came in by boat
a deal closed by the Reynosa family-- and Alejandro Rivera even paid a political visit to the mayor.
wonder Twins have been busy.
the Wonder who?
wonder Twins-- TV superheroes. They're brother and sister.
when they touch their rings, they activate-- form of a waterfall, shape of a dinosaur, that kind of thing.
okay, what do you think they are up to?
maybe they're following through on business before pleasure.
is killing Gibbs' father business or pleasure?
both.
want some help?
you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
your head's not here.
I saw the agents checking their weapons a while back.
figured something was up.
Paloma's back.
she surfaced about 300 miles away.
got no sense where she's headed yet.
coming here, I imagine.
your instincts were right.
sorry I doubted you.
been rough on everybody, Dad.
when this is over, why don't you come back to Stillwater with me, help me fix up the store?
it's all boarded up.
I could use an extra hand.
I got a job to do.
well, the job can wait.
is there something wrong with the front door?
wouldn't have been much of a surprise, then.
how'd you get past the agents?
dad, meet Mike Franks.
mind if I make myself at home?
what took you so long, cowboy?
three fingers for me, probie.
thought you were dead.
I got better.
so what happened after the gunfight that day?
I was hurt pretty bad.
I holed up in a little convent south of La Paz.
Padre there owed me.
you know, drinking wine and playing cards with the sisters, I never been closer to God.
hmm, before that, back in May.
after I got your call and made sure the girls were safe, I took on Bell's men.
they burned my little piece of heaven to the ground.
I got most of 'em.
they only got a little piece of me.
thanks for coming.
wasn't an option.
there's always options.
you got yourself in a heap of trouble, messing with the wrong familia.
there's some big guns after you down there-- up here.
sweet little Paloma's got a hornet up her skirt... and her sights are set on revenge.
think I'd miss that?
dangerous.
do what you have to for family.
what rule is that?
the unspoken one.
so, what do you think?
this one, or this one?
what's Darren know about collars?
nothing, but after guarding me for four months, I've come to value his quiet opinion.
you got something?
I got a lot. I analyzed everything in Estaban Lopez's G. I.tract, and based on major mass spec's icky findings, Ducky was right.
Paloma and her men were eating their way through the South.
I found traces of blue crab, salt pork, alligator-- all local proteins and all suggesting a food trail that leads from Mississippi to around the Florida panhandle.
they're moving.
Yeah, but that's just how long food stays in the human body.
by analyzing the healing progression of Lopez's various bug bites, which range from a Virginia chigger to a mosquito that's indigenous to the Everglades,
I was able to track his movements for four months.
now, assuming that they were together, it looks like Paloma's been on a mission.
those are drug routes.
Yeah, she wants to make sure that her product is well-distributed throughout the East Coast.
she wants us to see that her business is better than ever.
look, um, Gibbs, I know that we should arrest her, but in jail or not, she knows things about you, like dangerous things.
I mean, I just think we need a plan.
Yeah, I got one, Abbs.
well, that's great, Gibbs.
I'd really like to hear it sometime.
Ah, I missed these stained orange walls.
God bless tacky American bureaucracy.
the prodigal probie returns.
you know, I realized something, Tony.
you don't appreciate something until it's gone.
so you missed me, eh?
no, no, other things, like breakfast without beer.
I thought that was the Irish.
canadians, too. Beer doesn't go well with eggs or oatmeal. Why are you so tan?
why are you so white?
I've always been like this.
it becomes you.
you're lying. - Through my teeth.
the reason Paloma Reynosa never left is she never wanted to.
then what has she been doing here?
DiNozzo. - Yeah.
she's solidifying her cartel pipeline.
building new relationships, huh, and now?
now... she's coming after me.
that was the DEA. Got another body.
dead drug dealer-- Frederick, Maryland.
okay, take him with you, fill him in on the way.
Ziva? Alert Maryland State Police.
Paloma's getting closer, and she's not sightseeing.
welcome home, McGee.
excuse me, Director?
what is it?
I have Director David on a secure line.
tell Director David I'll call him back right away.
Yes, sir.
it's need-to-know.
I don't.
that's for sure.
Paloma could have set up a new pipeline anytime.
why now?
fuel to the fire.
your father-- where is he?
he's at home, safe.
I'd like to keep him that way.
if Paloma is responsible for this dealer in Maryland, I have to think that's about one thing, Gibbs
that's sending you a message.
nothing I don't know already, Leon.
I want to move you and your father to a safe house.
already in one.
that's what I thought last year with my wife.
why not take every precaution?
I am.
bringing in Mike Franks doesn't count.
I don't want Franks making things any worse than they already are.
no, it can't get any worse.
I hope you're right.
Where'd you learn to drive under the speed limit like that?
it's impressive.
saskatchewan?
you never complained about my driving before.
well, I do sense a change in you, Tim, maybe a little French-Canadian influence, Quebecois?
I am not listening to this.
you know how much tail Gretzky and Lemieux got back in the day?
it's nothing to be ashamed of.
I am not Canadian.
no worries, it just happens by osmosis, you know.
I was there for two weeks, Tony.
how about a little Celine Dion doing the Canadian national anthem?
Oh, will you just let us do our jobs?
o, Canada...
baby backs are on sale.
Hey, so listen to this.
witnesses report a Hispanic woman, mid-30s, left the store after they heard a gunshot.
sounds like our Paloma.
what do we know about our local butcher here?
well, his name's Charles Newburgh.
co-owns the place.
Chuck is in the chuck.
Yeah, rap sheet's a mile long, but he claimed he was trying to go clean.
although, local PD suspects this store of being a drug distribution center.
criminals.
was it nature or not enough nurture, Chuck?
looks like a small caliber to the back of the head. He let Paloma get close.
did you check the parking lot? 'Cause I'll bet you anything his car is gone.
think she stole it?
what better way to cross state lines than a no-frills meat truck?
I'll get a BOLO out.
come on.
22 bucks a pound for a rib-eye?
there's the real crime.
how long you been working on that?
about two months.
what's next, basket weaving?
you and me, Jackson, we're old enough to know what's important.
and sitting here whittling is no way to watch a clock tick down.
if this... Reynosa woman wants trouble, bring it on.
Yeah.
I had my moment with... Paloma Reynosa.
I'm not looking forward to the next one.
we got to get this over with.
grow some stones and take this sir down.
eh, don't listen to him, Dad.
Jethro, what he's saying makes sense.
Thanks, Mike.
I've got an opinion; he's got a right to hear it.
Yeah, well, hard to take a guy seriously who keeps getting body parts blown off.
when is this woman coming?
let's end this.
not just for me; for everyone.
this is so... - What's so funny?
nothing, just an e-mail from a friend.
guy friend?
Yes. My friend is a man.
interesting.
and did you meet said man in Miami?
DiNozzo. Really?
send him up.
who was that?
you'll know soon enough. I'd better tell the director.
tell me what?
sir, someone's here to see you.
that someone have a name?
I thought we should talk.
you got a lot of nerve showing your face around here.
legally, I've done nothing wrong.
what my sister does has no impact on my ability to represent the Mexican people.
your sister is a drug dealer and a murderer, and I have reason to believe it runs in the family.
your opinion is unfounded.
your men fired on one of my agents.
my men? I was in as much danger as Agent DiNozzo and Mr. Franks.
what do you want?
diplomacy.
Ah, easy to say, hard to achieve.
hmm, maybe not.
my sister is in your country to procure a new drug pipeline from Mexico to the Canadian border.
I can give you details-- details that will cripple her operation.
in exchange for what?
extradition.
let me take Paloma back to Mexico to be tried.
your sister could have bribed her way across the border at any time over the last four months.
why bring her home now?
because my country recognizes the trouble that she has caused.
I don't buy it.
diplomacy, remember?
I'll have to discuss this internally-- State Department, DEA.
of course. - No promises, no guarantees.
it's up to you, Director. So many lives, millions in drug money.
international relationships are often built on compromise.
not my relationships.
what do you think they're talking about?
I can think of a few things I'd like to say to Sir Rivera.
things that would probably get you arrested.
it wouldn't be the first time.
is Rivera smiling?
saw a cat smile like that once.
agent Gibbs.
what an unexpected surprise.
how's your sister, Alejandro?
considering the stress of the situation, it's nice to see you in good spirits.
Seor Rivera.
what are you doing here?
Abby, would you believe I came to see you?
um... no.
you know, I never did get that report.
well, I've told you multiple times that I sent it. Really, I did.
you know, it's funny.
ms. Hart was looking into the situation as well, and now she's out of the country.
I assume you have another printout of your findings.
no, there was just one.
you know, I'm terribly disappointed with how things turned out.
but look at me rambling.
it's late, and you should get home. Yeah, be careful.
the roads can be dangerous at night.
what did you just say?
nothing inappropriate, I hope.
you want to threaten someone, you can threaten me.
not the people I work with.
your team can be hotheaded and reactionary, Director.
they're not doing you any favors. - Let me do you one.
somebody show Sir Rivera out, before he gets hurt.
by whom? - By me.
I wish I had never gone to Mexico, never offered to help Alejandro.
I wish I had never finished that damn report.
he's just trying to get inside your head, Abbs.
Oh, he is inside my head, Gibbs, and he's making himself right at home.
not going to let anything happen to you.
Jethro, I'm glad I caught you.
look at this.
that's a Mexican Day of the Dead doll.
Precisely-- Day of the Dead-- and I just found it neatly tucked against my windshield.
I've got one, too.
a message perhaps from this afternoon's unwelcome guest?
Yeah. Gibbs.
don't look forward to the day you stop suffering because when it comes, you'll know you're dead.
got more Tennessee Williams for me, Paloma?
you remember how much I enjoy his work, Gibbs.
I hope you are enjoying mine.
Gibbs, are you all right?
McGee. Trace my last incoming call.
on it.
Darren, you stay with them, you stay with them.
give me a location.
locking onto the signal.
it's right outside your house.
get a hold of the agents detailed to my dad.
boss, it's, it's just ringing. They're not picking up.
get DiNozzo, get Ziva, get 'em there now, go!
what's wrong, son?
we were down in the basement.
one is dead, the other injured.
paramedics are on the way.
Tony's putting out a BOLO on Paloma.
you mean she was here?
why didn't she just finish the job?
because she's not done yet.
one of my agents is dead.
I'm sorry, but I... Don't tell me you don't know anything about it.
where is she?
if I knew, would I still be here?
would I be so interested in striking a deal?
I'm willing to give you all this information...
you go after my father and then you go after my team?
does your sister want a fight? Because if she does, let's settle this right now.
she's got one.
special Agent Gibbs, I was merely having dinner as a guest in your country.
are you really threatening a representative of the Mexican government?
I don't know, am I?
Mr. Ambassador, we have a situation.
Gibbs, Sir Rivera must be tired.
come on, Leon... - No.
we're done... for now.
it's time to avenge our father's death.
I'm sorry about your agent.
Yeah.
the other man?
he's stable.
dad, I can stop this.
but I'm gonna need your help.
whatever it takes.
okay. Let's go fishing.
Gibbs is moving his father to the safe house at Church Creek.
isolated.
let's keep it on the down-low.
no e-mails, no interoffice communication.
new protection detail?
assigning one. For now, Gibbs will be with him. They should be safe.
go inform your team.
Yes, sir.
well, so far Alejandro is nothing but predictable.
so what is he doing now?
he is making an encrypted call to a cell phone that's on the move.
the same one Paloma used before?
no, different one.
call Gibbs, tell him the eagle has landed.
okay, everything's ready.
doesn't matter where we go. A woman like this won't stop till she gets what she's after.
you talking from personal experience?
I've run from a few women in my time.
chased a few, too. - When we get there, what happens?
we wait.
you sure this is going to work, probie?
no.
hello. - Seor Rivera.
director Vance, what can I do for you?
I'd like to discuss a diplomatic compromise.
did I never tell you about the first case that Jethro and I worked?
two sailors capsized a recreational skiff one summer's eve.
panic ensued.
when they were finally located, one sailor was dead and the other severely hypothermic.
so the one sailor drowned?
no. Rather than watch his friend slowly expire, one sailor stabbed the other.
Yeah, claiming that it was more humane.
he was convinced that his actions were justified.
like Gibbs 20 years ago. - Yeah.
Ducky, what if this doesn't work?
what's gonna happen to Gibbs?
in 1940, Winston Churchill sat in his bunker smoking one of those majestic cigars, waiting for news that the first German bombs were decimating London.
let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties," he said over the radio.
and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire "and its commonwealth lasts for a thousand years, men will still say,'This was their finest hour.
the hour is upon us, Abby.
all we can do is wait and see.
let me assure you, Director, you're making a wise decision.
this kind of combined effort between our countries sends a powerful message to the international drug community.
one of my agents is dead, and your sister's going home.
what kind of positive message is that?
what we do is necessary for the greater good.
there's nothing good about this.
excuse me for the interruption, sir.
details.
unconfirmed.
Gibbs?
he's okay. He's gonna lay low. Spend the night in the safe house.
um, is everything all right, Director?
sir Rivera, something's come up.
we're gonna have to continue this at another time.
there's an agent outside who'll show you out.
of course.
anything? - He saw the note.
he keeps trying to call Paloma, but I'm blocking reception.
no text messages either.
he thinks she's not answering.
all right, where is she now?
looks like she's headed for the safe house in Church Creek.
Gibbs' plan to catch her may actually work.
drop the weapon!
on your knees!
get down on the ground!
I did this for my sister!
to finish what she started.
Gibbs? No, they said you were in there.
nobody said we were inside this safe house.
you killed my sister.
no, but someone was in there, right?
who? Who was in there?
Paloma... Paloma... - I'll call an ambulance.
Paloma... No,
will you walk into my parlor?" said the spider to the fly.
do you know that poem, Gibbs?
Leyla and Amira are waiting for you.
don't miss your flight.
much obliged, Director.
appreciate you staying to help.
sure.
thought maybe we could fix a few things.
you sure you can spare the time?
do what you have to for family.
ain't that the truth?
what's an NCIS agent doing so far from home?
I'm teaching a class on the forensics of cold cases.
we're using the murder of a man named Pedro Hernandez as a case study.
I need to exhume the body of Pedro Hernandez.
the body of a drug dealer from 20 years ago?
I don't think anyone will mind.
I have it.
the evidence in my report says that you killed Pedro Hernandez.
I mean, I know he killed your wife and your daughter.
tell me what your patriot Bell is up to.
he's been accumulating information on Special Agent Gibbs.
where is he?
last I heard he was headed back down to Mexico.
I need you to get a message to Mike for me.
the message is: Rule number 44.
Oh, Mike.
that ain't Franks.
who is it? - Colonel Merton Bell.
Colonel Bell wanted to prove he was a better man than you.
he and his men made for a useful ally, but they were a means to an end.
then you might as well put a bullet in my head right now, because you're not gonna get anything.
well, hermano, does he have your precious report?
no. - Brother and sister.
but I never lost a night's sleep over your father.
this is the bullet that should end you.
do you think I want that?
what's your assignment here?
director's orders. Observe and report.
if I must... I promise to personally visit Pennsylvania and shoot your father in the head...
can I help you?
Yes, MrGibbs.
I think you can.
now, ma'am... you need to go.
but we have so much to talk about.
from what I hear, you didn't come to talk.
you are just like your son.
no, ma'am.
he's just like me.
how confident are you...
Mr. Gibbs?
I was raised on a farm.
used to play chicken in my daddy's truck every Saturday night.
this ain't much different.
find him.
he is gone.
I thought we'd try some ham today.
I hope those eggs aren't overcooked.
you don't have to make breakfast for me every day, Dad.
breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
gets your batteries charged.
mom used to say that.
thought I'd do some errands today.
fix that faucet upstairs.
anything you need?
no.
wish you'd take the agents with you.
do I really need those guys?
they're good men, Dad.
I've been living in this house under lock and key for months now.
they've never done a damn thing.
you're lucky you're not dead.
I'm lucky there was a storm cellar I could hide out in.
son...
I want to go home. It's time.
when it's safe.
watching it again is not gonna change anything.
it was a trap.
Yep. - Now look.
Rivera gives the signal.
all hell breaks loose.
he knew we were following him. We walked right into it.
let it go, Dinizzo.
any word from Franks?
sorry, boss. Observe and report.
director's orders.
it's hard to observe when you're being shot at.
think Vance is still angry with me?
what do you think?
morning, sir. We were just discussing our continued effort to locate Paloma Reynosa.
And?
how about those Washington Nationals, sir?
I just got off the phone with SECNAV.
he wants to know why NCIS can't successfully orchestrate a manhunt for one female drug dealer.
it's Mexico.
what's to say she hasn't already crossed the border?
my gut.
the DEA wants to step in.
however, I'd like to save face.
and despite Sir Rivera's family ties, the Mexican government has opted to keep him in a position of authority.
the government's got their hands full these days.
I guess the Reynosas have paid off the right people.
Yeah, or killed them.
status report.
Ziva's following a lead in Miami, a Cuban tie-in.
agent McGee.
at the Canadian border.
this is starting to impact our workload.
Paloma could be anywhere in the world by now.
Yeah, Leon, or she could be across the street.
dead reservist. Check it.
saddle up, Dinizzo.
we're not going to Arizona, are we?
west Virginia.
spectacular.
are those the Blue Ridge Mountains?
Shenandoah River's not far.
thank God I'm a country lad!
country boy," Ducky.
for an emergency landing, this helicopter's surprisingly intact.
landing's not what killed them.
them? As in more than one them?
captain John McMahon, owned and piloted the charter service.
around 2: 00 a. m. this morning, he was in the middle of a job when he, uh, reported mechanical trouble.
then he made a Mayday and set her down here.
that was the last anybody heard from him.
based on the blood flow pattern, the real trouble wasn't midair.
the captain was shot here on the ground.
got another gunshot wound over here, Doctor.
there's a nine-millimeter casing in the grass, boss.
45 next to the pilot.
wait, they shot each other?
you got a passenger manifest?
no, sir. No route logged, either.
middle of the night, somebody hired this guy on the QT.
so, after the Mayday, the passenger couldn't risk talking to the police, so he shot McMahon.
he didn't expect him to shoot back.
wait a minute, where are the guns?
Holster's empty.
eye in the sky. - Record his flights.
must've had more than a few bad customers.
that's her.
doc, got a time a death?
approximately... nine hours ago.
hell of a lead time.
DiNozzo, local airports on alert.
call Vance. Tell him we need agents at the state border.
where do you figure Ms. Reynosa's headed, Metro?
I don't know, Duck.
but I'd sure like to get there first.
well, you know, West Virginia has five bordering states, boss.
giving out geography lessons now, are you, Dinozzo?
I'm just saying that's a lot of land to cover.
get Ziva back from Miami; tell McGee the chopper was heading north when it went down.
north as in Canada?
Yeah, maybe.
that horse likes you.
this isn't funny, Tony.
Oh, poor McMountie.
Hey, so have you seen any, like, moose and stuff up there?
Hey, uh, where's your buddy, Claude?
isn't that your friendly St. Bernard with the little barrel of whiskey under his chin?
look, I've been up here playing Dudley Do-Right for two weeks, okay?
it's September, and there's snow on the ground.
would you at least give me a little compassion here?
and what would that be for, huh?
did you forget to take off your toque when you entered a room?
you're gonna get in trouble up there-- hanging with the blue-necks, throwing back a two-four of pale ale...
I've actually been working, unlike certain people.
certain people here are working, McGee.
uh, of course, boss.
Paloma Reynosa was in a chopper headed up the coast-- any idea why?
well, DEA and Mounties narc division shut down a border exchange yesterday.
the product was from Mexico and had potential ties to the Reynosa cartel.
so Paloma could've been headed there to seal the deal?
if the copter hadn't gone down, we might've gotten her.
boss, can I please come home?
nice horse, Tim.
boss?
Mr. Palmer, did you ever visit the paradise that is Turks and Caicos?
no, but I did drive down to the Florida Keys once, and I had the most delicious key lime pie at this little shack right there on U. S. 1.
I swear, the meringue had the appearance of nimbus clouds.
and... 
I'm sorry. Uh, you were saying?
well, as a boy, my parents used to refer to the region as the British West Indies.
but never in my life have I encountered insects as unique to a locale as there.
uh, so you are reminiscing based on the bug bites on Estaban Lopez.
Reynosa's friend here had no idea what he was into, traveling with her.
his dermis is a veritable road map of entomological reactions, and that, combined with the contents of his stomach...
I am sure we can ascertain their various destinations.
so you can actually tell the difference between these bug bites?
of course, Mr. Palmer.
Yeah, the Everglades are home to 43 species of mosquito alone.
Yeah, and don't get me started on South Carolina's velvet ant.
now, then, I'll run the gut while you get that up to Abby for analysis.
Yes, perhaps our friend Estaban here can not only help us find his previous employer, he can tell us where she's been.
definitely not now, Dad.
Hello, Tony. I'm back.
well, hello, Little Miss Sunshine State, and don't you look balmy?
I do not know what "balmy" means, but I will assume it is not good.
well, just because I was alone manning the fort, handling Gibbs solo while you've been strolling around South Beach, dancing to the rhythm of the night...
...why would I feel the need to say anything negative?
because you are you.
besides, I was working the entire time.
ha. - Ha, what?
working.
are those tan lines?
where do you think you're looking?
does it even matter?
well, actually, yes, it does, and I can assure you I do not have any tan lines.
Oh, so you did lay in the sun?
Yes, I did, actually, this morning before my flight, and I came up with something case-related prior to my departure.
hmm, you smell like ocean and shea butter.
a local Dade County informant said that a Mexican drug shipment recently came in by boat
a deal closed by the Reynosa family-- and Alejandro Rivera even paid a political visit to the mayor.
wonder Twins have been busy.
the wonder who?
wonder Twins-- TV superheroes. They're brother and sister.
when they touch their rings, they activate-- form of a waterfall, shape of a dinosaur, that kind of thing.
okay, what do you think they are up to?
maybe they're following through on business before pleasure.
is killing Gibbs' father business or pleasure?
both.
want some help?
you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
your head's not here.
I saw the agents checking their weapons a while back.
figured something was up.
Paloma's back.
she surfaced about 300 miles away.
got no sense where she's headed yet.
coming here, I imagine.
your instincts were right.
sorry I doubted you.
been rough on everybody, Dad.
when this is over, why don't you come back to Stillwater with me, help me fix up the store?
it's all boarded up.
I could use an extra hand.
I got a job to do.
well, the job can wait.
is there something wrong with the front door?
wouldn't have been much of a surprise, then.
how'd you get past the agents?
dad, meet Mike Franks.
mind if I make myself at home?
what took you so long, cowboy?
three fingers for me, probie.
thought you were dead.
I got better.
so what happened after the gunfight that day?
I was hurt pretty bad.
I holed up in a little convent south of La Paz.
Padre there owed me.
you know, drinking wine and playing cards with the sisters, I never been closer to God.
hmm, before that, back in May.
after I got your call and made sure the girls were safe, I took on Bell's men.
they burned my little piece of heaven to the ground.
I got most of 'em.
they only got a little piece of me.
thanks for coming.
wasn't an option.
there's always options.
you got yourself in a heap of trouble, messing with the wrong familia.
there's some big guns after you down there-- up here.
sweet little Paloma's got a hornet up her skirt... and her sights are set on revenge.
think I'd miss that?
dangerous.
do what you have to for family.
what rule is that?
the unspoken one.
so, what do you think?
this one, or this one?
what's Darren know about collars?
nothing, but after guarding me for four months, I've come to value his quiet opinion.
you got something?
I got a lot. I analyzed everything in Estaban Lopez's G. I. Tract, and based on major mass spec's icky findings, Ducky was right.
Paloma and her men were eating their way through the South.
I found traces of blue crab, salt pork, alligator-- all local proteins and all suggesting a food trail that leads from Mississippi to around the Florida panhandle.
they're moving.
Yeah, but that's just how long food stays in the human body.
by analyzing the healing progression of Lopez's various bug bites, which range from a Virginia chigger to a mosquito that's indigenous to the Everglades,
I was able to track his movements for four months.
now, assuming that they were together, it looks like Paloma's been on a mission.
those are drug routes.
Yeah, she wants to make sure that her product is well-distributed throughout the East Coast.
she wants us to see that her business is better than ever.
look, um, Gibbs, I know that we should arrest her, but in jail or not, she knows things about you, like dangerous things.
I mean, I just think we need a plan.
Yeah, I got one, Abbs.
well, that's great, Gibbs.
I'd really like to hear it sometime.
Ah, I missed these stained orange walls.
God bless tacky American bureaucracy.
the prodigal probie returns.
you know, I realized something, Tony.
you don't appreciate something until it's gone.
so you missed me, eh?
no, no, other things, like breakfast without beer.
I thought that was the Irish.
canadians, too. Beer doesn't go well with eggs or oatmeal. Why are you so tan?
why are you so white?
I've always been like this.
it becomes you.
you're lying. - Through my teeth.
the reason Paloma Reynosa never left is she never wanted to.
then what has she been doing here?
DiNozzo. - Yeah.
she's solidifying her cartel pipeline.
building new relationships, huh, and now?
now... she's coming after me.
that was the DEA. Got another body.
dead drug dealer-- Frederick, Maryland.
okay, take him with you, fill him in on the way.
Ziva? Alert Maryland State Police.
Paloma's getting closer, and she's not sightseeing.
welcome home, McGee.
excuse me, Director?
what is it?
I have Director David on a secure line.
tell Director David I'll call him back right away.
Yes, sir.
it's need-to-know.
I don't.
that's for sure.
Paloma could have set up a new pipeline anytime.
why now?
fuel to the fire.
your father-- where is he?
he's at home, safe.
I'd like to keep him that way.
if Paloma is responsible for this dealer in Maryland, I have to think that's about one thing, Gibbs
that's sending you a message.
nothing I don't know already, Leon.
I want to move you and your father to a safe house.
already in one.
that's what I thought last year with my wife.
why not take every precaution?
I am.
bringing in Mike Franks doesn't count.
I don't want Franks making things any worse than they already are.
no, it can't get any worse.
I hope you're right.
Where'd you learn to drive under the speed limit like that?
it's impressive.
saskatchewan?
you never complained about my driving before.
well, I do sense a change in you, Tim, maybe a little French-Canadian influence. Quebecois?
I am not listening to this.
you know how much tail Gretzky and Lemieux got back in the day?
it's nothing to be ashamed of.
I am not Canadian.
no worries, it just happens by osmosis, you know.
I was there for two weeks, Tony.
how about a little Celine Dion doing the Canadian national anthem?
Oh, will you just let us do our jobs?
o, Canada...
baby backs are on sale.
Hey, so listen to this.
witnesses report a Hispanic woman, mid-30s, left the store after they heard a gunshot.
sounds like our Paloma.
what do we know about our local butcher here?
well, his name's Charles Newburgh.
co-owns the place.
Chuck is in the chuck.
Yeah, rap sheet's a mile long, but he claimed he was trying to go clean.
although, local PD suspects this store of being a drug distribution center.
criminals.
was it nature or not enough nurture, Chuck?
looks like a small caliber to the back of the head. He let Paloma get close.
did you check the parking lot? 'Cause I'll bet you anything his car is gone.
think she stole it?
what better way to cross state lines than a no-frills meat truck?
I'll get a BOLO out.
come on.
22 bucks a pound for a rib-eye?
there's the real crime.
how long you been working on that?
about two months.
what's next, basket weaving?
you and me, Jackson, we're old enough to know what's important.
and sitting here whittling is no way to watch a clock tick down.
if this... Reynosa woman wants trouble, bring it on.
Yeah.
I had my moment with... Paloma Reynosa.
I'm not looking forward to the next one.
grow some stones and take this sir down.
grow some stones and take this sir down.
eh, don't listen to him, Dad.
Jethro, what he's saying makes sense.
Thanks, Mike.
I've got an opinion; he's got a right to hear it.
Yeah, well, hard to take a guy seriously who keeps getting body parts blown off.
when is this woman coming?
let's end this.
not just for me; for everyone.
this is so... - What's so funny?
nothing, just an e-mail from a friend.
guy friend?
Yes. My friend is a man.
interesting.
and did you meet said man in Miami?
DiNozzo. Really?
send him up.
who was that?
you'll know soon enough. I'd better tell the director.
tell me what?
sir, someone's here to see you.
that someone have a name?
I thought we should talk.
you got a lot of nerve showing your face around here.
legally, I've done nothing wrong.
what my sister does has no impact on my ability to represent the Mexican people.
your sister is a drug dealer and a murderer, and I have reason to believe it runs in the family.
your opinion is unfounded.
your men fired on one of my agents.
my men? I was in as much danger as Agent DiNozzo and Mr. Franks.
what do you want?
diplomacy.
Ah, easy to say, hard to achieve.
hmm, maybe not.
my sister is in your country to procure a new drug pipeline from Mexico to the Canadian border.
I can give you details-- details that will cripple her operation.
in exchange for what?
extradition.
let me take Paloma back to Mexico to be tried.
your sister could have bribed her way across the border at any time over the last four months.
why bring her home now?
because my country recognizes the trouble that she has caused.
I don't buy it.
diplomacy, remember?
I'll have to discuss this internally-- State Department, DEA.
of course. - No promises, no guarantees.
it's up to you, Director. So many lives, millions in drug money.
international relationships are often built on compromise.
not my relationships.
what do you think they're talking about?
I can think of a few things I'd like to say to Sir Rivera.
things that would probably get you arrested.
it wouldn't be the first time.
is Rivera smiling?
saw a cat smile like that once.
agent Gibbs.
what an unexpected surprise.
how's your sister, Alejandro?
considering the stress of the situation, it's nice to see you in good spirits.
sir Rivera.
what are you doing here?
Abby, would you believe I came to see you?
um... no.
you know, I never did get that report.
well, I've told you multiple times that I sent it. Really, I did.
you know, it's funny.
ms. Hart was looking into the situation as well, and now she's out of the country.
I assume you have another printout of your findings.
no, there was just one.
you know, I'm terribly disappointed with how things turned out.
but look at me rambling.
it's late, and you should get home. Yeah, be careful.
the roads can be dangerous at night.
what did you just say?
nothing inappropriate, I hope.
you want to threaten someone, you can threaten me.
not the people I work with.
your team can be hotheaded and reactionary, Director.
they're not doing you any favors. - Let me do you one.
somebody show Sir Rivera out, before he gets hurt.
by whom? - By me.
I wish I had never gone to Mexico, never offered to help Alejandro.
I wish I had never finished that damn report.
he's just trying to get inside your head, Abbs.
Oh, he is inside my head, Gibbs, and he's making himself right at home.
not going to let anything happen to you.
Jethro, I'm glad I caught you.
look at this.
that's a Mexican Day of the Dead doll.
Precisely-- Day of the Dead-- and I just found it neatly tucked against my windshield.
I've got one, too.
a message perhaps from this afternoon's unwelcome guest?
Yeah. Gibbs.
don't look forward to the day you stop suffering because when it comes, you'll know you're dead.
got more Tennessee Williams for me, Paloma?
you remember how much I enjoy his work, Gibbs.
I hope you are enjoying mine.
Gibbs, are you all right?
McGee. Trace my last incoming call.
on it.
Darren, you stay with them, you stay with them.
give me a location.
locking onto the signal.
it's right outside your house.
get a hold of the agents detailed to my dad.
boss, it's, it's just ringing. They're not picking up.
get Dinozzo, get Ziva, get 'em there now, go!
what's wrong, son?
we were down in the basement.
one is dead, the other injured.
paramedics are on the way.
Tony's putting out a BOLO on Paloma.
you mean she was here?
why didn't she just finish the job?
because she's not done yet.
one of my agents is dead.
I'm sorry, but I... Don't tell me you don't know anything about it.
where is she?
if I knew, would I still be here?
would I be so interested in striking a deal?
I'm willing to give you all this information...
you go after my father and then you go after my team?
does your sister want a fight? Because if she does, let's settle this right now.
she's got one.
special Agent Gibbs, I was merely having dinner as a guest in your country.
are you really threatening a representative of the Mexican government?
I don't know, am I?
Mr. Ambassador, we have a situation.
Gibbs, Sir Rivera must be tired.
come on, Leon... - No.
we're done... for now.
it's time to avenge our father's death.
I'm sorry about your agent.
Yeah.
the other man?
he's stable.
dad, I can stop this.
but I'm gonna need your help.
whatever it takes.
okay. Let's go fishing.
Gibbs is moving his father to the safe house at Church Creek.
isolated.
let's keep it on the down-low.
no e-mails, no interoffice communication.
new protection detail?
assigning one. For now, Gibbs will be with him. They should be safe.
go inform your team.
Yes, sir.
well, so far Alejandro is nothing but predictable.
so what is he doing now?
he is making an encrypted call to a cell phone that's on the move.
the same one Paloma used before?
no, different one.
call Gibbs, tell him the eagle has landed.
okay, everything's ready.
doesn't matter where we go. A woman like this won't stop till she gets what she's after.
you talking from personal experience?
I've run from a few women in my time.
chased a few, too. - When we get there, what happens?
we wait.
you sure this is going to work, probie?
no.
hello. - Sir Rivera.
director Vance, what can I do for you?
I'd like to discuss a diplomatic compromise.
did I never tell you about the first case that Jethro and I worked?
two sailors capsized a recreational skiff one summer's eve.
panic ensued.
when they were finally located, one sailor was dead and the other severely hypothermic.
so the one sailor drowned?
no. Rather than watch his friend slowly expire, one sailor stabbed the other.
Yeah, claiming that it was more humane.
he was convinced that his actions were justified.
like Gibbs 20 years ago. - Yeah.
Ducky, what if this doesn't work?
what's gonna happen to Gibbs?
in 1940, Winston Churchill sat in his bunker smoking one of those majestic cigars, waiting for news that the first German bombs were decimating London.
let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties," he said over the radio.
and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire "and its commonwealth lasts for a thousand years, men will still say, 'This was their finest hour.
the hour is upon us, Abby.
all we can do is wait and see.
let me assure you, Director, you're making a wise decision.
this kind of combined effort between our countries sends a powerful message to the international drug community.
one of my agents is dead, and your sister's going home.
what kind of positive message is that?
what we do is necessary for the greater good.
there's nothing good about this.
excuse me for the interruption, sir.
details.
unconfirmed.
Gibbs?
he's okay. He's gonna lay low. Spend the night in the safe house.
um, is everything all right, Director?
sir Rivera, something's come up.
we're gonna have to continue this at another time.
there's an agent outside who'll show you out.
of course.
anything? - He saw the note.
he keeps trying to call Paloma, but I'm blocking reception.
no text messages either.
he thinks she's not answering.
all right, where is she now?
looks like she's headed for the safe house in Church Creek.
Gibbs' plan to catch her may actually work.
drop the weapon!
on your knees!
get down on the ground!
I did this for my sister!
to finish what she started.
Gibbs? No, they said you were in there.
nobody said we were inside this safe house.
you killed my sister.
no, but someone was in there, right?
who? Who was in there?
Paloma... Paloma... - I'll call an ambulance.
Paloma... No, perdname.
will you walk into my parlor?"said the spider to the fly.
do you know that poem, Gibbs?
Leyla and Amira are waiting for you.
don't miss your flight.
much obliged, Director.
appreciate you staying to help.
sure.
thought maybe we could fix a few things.
you sure you can spare the time?
do what you have to for family.
ain't that the truth?
what's an NCIS agent doing so far from home?
I'm teaching a class on the forensics of cold cases.
we're using the murder of a man named Pedro Hernandez as a case study.
I need to exhume the body of Pedro Hernandez.
the body of a drug dealer from 20 years ago?
I don't think anyone will mind.
I have it.
the evidence in my report says that you killed Pedro Hernandez.
I mean, I know he killed your wife and your daughter.
tell me what your patriot Bell is up to.
he's been accumulating information on Special Agent Gibbs.
where is he?
last I heard he was headed back down to Mexico.
I need you to get a message to Mike for me.
the message is: Rule number 44.
Oh, Mike.
that ain't Franks.
who is it? - Colonel Merton Bell.
Colonel Bell wanted to prove he was a better man than you.
he and his men made for a useful ally, but they were a means to an end.
then you might as well put a bullet in my head right now, because you're not gonna get anything.
well, hermano, does he have your precious report?
no. - Brother and sister.
but I never lost a night's sleep over your father.
this is the bullet that should end you.
do you think I want that?
what's your assignment here?
director's orders. Observe and report.
if I must... I promise to personally visit Pennsylvania and shoot your father in the head...
can I help you?
Yes, MrGibbs.
I think you can.
now, ma'am... you need to go.
but we have so much to talk about.
from what I hear, you didn't come to talk.
you are just like your son.
no, ma'am.
he's just like me.
how confident are you...
Mr. Gibbs?
I was raised on a farm.
used to play chicken in my daddy's truck every Saturday night.
this ain't much different.
Mtalo. Ahora.
find him.
he is gone.
I thought we'd try some ham today.
I hope those eggs aren't overcooked.
you don't have to make breakfast for me every day, Dad.
breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
gets your batteries charged.
mom used to say that.
thought I'd do some errands today.
fix that faucet upstairs.
anything you need?
no.
wish you'd take the agents with you.
do I really need those guys?
they're good men, Dad.
I've been living in this house under lock and key for months now.
they've never done a damn thing.
you're lucky you're not dead.
I'm lucky there was a storm cellar I could hide out in.
son...
I want to go home. It's time.
when it's safe.
watching it again is not gonna change anything.
it was a trap.
Yep. - Now look.
Rivera gives the signal.
all hell breaks loose.
he knew we were following him. We walked right into it.
let it go, Dinizzo.
any word from Franks?
sorry, boss. Observe and report.
director's orders.
it's hard to observe when you're being shot at.
think Vance is still angry with me?
what do you think?
morning, sir. We were just discussing our continued effort to locate Paloma Reynosa.
And?
how about those Washington Nationals, sir?
I just got off the phone with SECNAV.
he wants to know why NCIS can't successfully orchestrate a manhunt for one female drug dealer.
it's Mexico.
what's to say she hasn't already crossed the border?
my gut.
the DEA wants to step in.
however, I'd like to save face.
and despite Sir Rivera's family ties, the Mexican government has opted to keep him in a position of authority.
the government's got their hands full these days.
I guess the Reynosa's have paid off the right people.
Yeah, or killed them.
status report.
Ziva's following a lead in Miami, a Cuban tie-in.
agent McGee.
at the Canadian border.
this is starting to impact our workload.
Paloma could be anywhere in the world by now.
Yeah, Leon, or she could be across the street.
dead reservist. Check it.
saddle up, Dinizzo.
we're not going to Arizona, are we?
west Virginia.
spectacular.
are those the Blue Ridge Mountains?
Shenandoah River's not far.
thank God I'm a country lad!
country boy," Ducky.
for an emergency landing, this helicopter's surprisingly intact.
landing's not what killed them.
them? As in more than one them?
captain John McMahon, owned and piloted the charter service.
around 2: 00 a. m. this morning, he was in the middle of a job when he, uh, reported mechanical trouble.
then he made a Mayday and set her down here.
that was the last anybody heard from him.
based on the blood flow pattern, the real trouble wasn't midair.
the captain was shot here on the ground.
got another gunshot wound over here, Doctor.
there's a nine-millimeter casing in the grass, boss.
.45 next to the pilot.
wait, they shot each other?
you got a passenger manifest?
no, sir. No route logged, either.
middle of the night, somebody hired this guy on the QT.
so, after the Mayday, the passenger couldn't risk talking to the police, so he shot McMahon.
he didn't expect him to shoot back.
wait a minute, where are the guns?
Holster's empty.
eye in the sky. - Record his flights.
must've had more than a few bad customers.
that's her.
doc, got a time a death?
approximately... nine hours ago.
hell of a lead time.
Dinizzo, local airports on alert.
call Vance. Tell him we need agents at the state border.
where do you figure Ms. Reynosa's headed, Jethro?
I don't know, Duck.
but I'd sure like to get there first.
well, you know, West Virginia has five bordering states, boss.
giving out geography lessons now, are you, Dinizzo?
I'm just saying that's a lot of land to cover.
get Ziva back from Miami; tell McGee the chopper was heading north when it went down.
north as in Canada?
Yeah, maybe.
that horse likes you.
this isn't funny, Tony.
Oh, poor McMountie.
Hey, so have you seen any, like, moose and stuff up there?
Hey, uh, where's your buddy, Claude?
isn't that your friendly St. Bernard with the little barrel of whiskey under his chin?
look, I've been up here playing Dudley Do-Right for two weeks, okay?
it's September, and there's snow on the ground.
would you at least give me a little compassion here?
and what would that be for, huh?
did you forget to take off your toque when you entered a room?
you're gonna get in trouble up there-- hanging with the blue-necks, throwing back a two-four of pale ale...
I've actually been working, unlike certain people.
certain people here are working, McGee.
uh, of course, boss.
Paloma Reynosa was in a chopper headed up the coast-- any idea why?
well, DEA and Mounties narc division shut down a border exchange yesterday.
the product was from Mexico and had potential ties to the Reynosa cartel.
so Paloma could've been headed there to seal the deal?
if the copter hadn't gone down, we might've gotten her.
boss, can I please come home?
nice horse, Tim.
boss?
Mr. Palmer, did you ever visit the paradise that is Turks and Caicos?
no, but I did drive down to the Florida Keys once, and I had the most delicious key lime pie at this little shack right there on U. S. 1.
I swear, the meringue had the appearance of nimbus clouds.
and... 
I'm sorry. Uh, you were saying?
well, as a boy, my parents used to refer to the region as the British West Indies.
but never in my life have I encountered insects as unique to a locale as there.
uh, so you are reminiscing based on the bug bites on Estaban Lopez.
Reynosa's friend here had no idea what he was into, traveling with her.
his dermis is a veritable road map of entomological reactions, and that, combined with the contents of his stomach...
I am sure we can ascertain their various destinations.
so you can actually tell the difference between these bug bites?
of course, Mr. Palmer.
Yeah, the Everglades are home to 43 species of mosquito alone.
Yeah, and don't get me started on South Carolina's velvet ant.
now, then, I'll run the gut while you get that up to Abby for analysis.
Yes, perhaps our friend Estaban here can not only help us find his previous employer, he can tell us where she's been.
definitely not now, Dad.
Hello, Tony. I'm back.
well, hello, Little Miss Sunshine State, and don't you look balmy?
I do not know what "balmy" means, but I will assume it is not good.
well, just because I was alone manning the fort, handling Gibbs solo while you've been strolling around South Beach, dancing to the rhythm of the night...
...why would I feel the need to say anything negative?
because you are you.
besides, I was working the entire time.
ha. - Ha, what?
working.
are those tan lines?
where do you think you're looking?
does it even matter?
well, actually, yes, it does, and I can assure you I do not have any tan lines.
Oh, so you did lay in the sun?
Yes, I did, actually, this morning before my flight, and I came up with something case-related prior to my departure.
hmm, you smell like ocean and shea butter.
a local Dade County informant said that a Mexican drug shipment recently came in by boat
a deal closed by the Reynosa family-- and Alejandro Rivera even paid a political visit to the mayor.
wonder Twins have been busy.
the wonder who?
wonder Twins-- TV superheroes. They're brother and sister.
when they touch their rings, they activate-- form of a waterfall, shape of a dinosaur, that kind of thing.
okay, what do you think they are up to?
maybe they're following through on business before pleasure.
is killing Gibbs' father business or pleasure?
both.
want some help?
you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
your head's not here.
I saw the agents checking their weapons a while back.
figured something was up.
Paloma's back.
she surfaced about 300 miles away.
got no sense where she's headed yet.
coming here, I imagine.
your instincts were right.
sorry I doubted you.
been rough on everybody, Dad.
when this is over, why don't you come back to Stillwater with me, help me fix up the store?
it's all boarded up.
I could use an extra hand.
I got a job to do.
well, the job can wait.
is there something wrong with the front door?
wouldn't have been much of a surprise, then.
how'd you get past the agents?
dad, meet Mike Franks.
mind if I make myself at home?
what took you so long, cowboy?
three fingers for me, probie.
thought you were dead.
I got better.
so what happened after the gunfight that day?
I was hurt pretty bad.
I holed up in a little convent south of La Paz.
Padre there owed me.
you know, drinking wine and playing cards with the sisters, I never been closer to God.
hmm, before that, back in May.
after I got your call and made sure the girls were safe, I took on Bell's men.
they burned my little piece of heaven to the ground.
I got most of 'em.
they only got a little piece of me.
thanks for coming.
wasn't an option.
there's always options.
you got yourself in a heap of trouble, messing with the wrong familia.
there's some big guns after you down there-- up here.
sweet little Paloma's got a hornet up her skirt... and her sights are set on revenge.
think I'd miss that?
dangerous.
do what you have to for family.
what rule is that?
the unspoken one.
so, what do you think?
this one, or this one?
what's Darren know about collars?
nothing, but after guarding me for four months, I've come to value his quiet opinion.
you got something?
I got a lot. I analyzed everything in Estaban Lopez's G. I. Tract,
okay, take him with you, fill him in on the way.
Ziva? Alert Maryland State Police.
Paloma's getting closer, and she's not sightseeing.
welcome home, McGee.
excuse me, Director?
what is it?
I have Director David on a secure line.
tell Director David I'll call him back right away.
Yes, sir.
it's need-to-know.
I don't.
that's for sure.
Paloma could have set up a new pipeline anytime.
why now?
fuel to the fire.
your father-- where is he?
he's at home, safe.
I'd like to keep him that way.
if Paloma is responsible for this dealer in Maryland, I have to think that's about one thing, Gibbs
that's sending you a message.
nothing I don't know already, Leon.
I want to move you and your father to a safe house.
already in one.
that's what I thought last year with my wife.
why not take every precaution?
I am.
bringing in Mike Franks doesn't count.
I don't want Franks making things any worse than they already are.
no, it can't get any worse.
I hope you're right.
Where'd you learn to drive under the speed limit like that?
it's impressive.
saskatchewan?
you never complained about my driving before.
well, I do sense a change in you, Tim, maybe a little French-Canadian influence. Quebecois?
I am not listening to this.
you know how much tail Gretzky and Lemieux got back in the day?
it's nothing to be ashamed of.
I am not Canadian.
no worries, it just happens by osmosis, you know.
I was there for two weeks, Tony.
how about a little Celine Dion doing the Canadian national anthem?
Oh, will you just let us do our jobs?
o, Canada...
baby backs are on sale.
Hey, so listen to this.
witnesses report a Hispanic woman, mid-30s, left the store after they heard a gunshot.
sounds like our Paloma.
what do we know about our local butcher here?
well, his name's Charles Newburgh.
co-owns the place.
Chuck is in the chuck.
Yeah, rap sheet's a mile long, but he claimed he was trying to go clean.
although, local PD suspects this store of being a drug distribution center.
criminals.
was it nature or not enough nurture, Chuck?
looks like a small caliber to the back of the head. He let Paloma get close.
did you check the parking lot? 'Cause I'll bet you anything his car is gone.
think she stole it?
what better way to cross state lines than a no-frills meat truck?
I'll get a BOLO out.
come on.
22 bucks a pound for a rib-eye?
there's the real crime.
how long you been working on that?
about two months.
what's next, basket weaving?
you and me, Jackson, we're old enough to know what's important.
and sitting here whittling is no way to watch a clock tick down.
if this... Reynosa woman wants trouble, bring it on.
Yeah.
I had my moment with... Paloma Reynosa.
I'm not looking forward to the next one.
we got to get this over with.
grow some stones and take this sir down.
eh, don't listen to him, Dad.
Jethro, what he's saying makes sense.
Thanks, Mike.
I've got an opinion; he's got a right to hear it.
Yeah, well, hard to take a guy seriously who keeps getting body parts blown off.
when is this woman coming?
let's end this.
not just for me; for everyone.
this is so... - What's so funny?
nothing, just an e-mail from a friend.
guy friend?
Yes. My friend is a man.
interesting.
and did you meet said man in Miami?
Dinizzo. Really?
send him up.
who was that?
you'll know soon enough. I'd better tell the director.
tell me what?
sir, someone's here to see you.
that someone have a name?
I thought we should talk.
you got a lot of nerve showing your face around here.
legally, I've done nothing wrong.
what my sister does has no impact on my ability to represent the Mexican people.
your sister is a drug dealer and a murderer, and I have reason to believe it runs in the family.
your opinion is unfounded.
your men fired on one of my agents.
my men? I was in as much danger as Agent Dinizzo and Mr. Franks.
what do you want?
diplomacy.
Ah, easy to say, hard to achieve.
hmm, maybe not.
my sister is in your country to procure a new drug pipeline from Mexico to the Canadian border.
I can give you details-- details that will cripple her operation.
in exchange for what?
extradition.
let me take Paloma back to Mexico to be tried.
your sister could have bribed her way across the border at any time over the last four months.
why bring her home now?
because my country recognizes the trouble that she has caused.
I don't buy it.
diplomacy, remember?
I'll have to discuss this internally-- State Department, DEA.
of course. - No promises, no guarantees.
it's up to you, Director. So many lives, millions in drug money.
international relationships are often built on compromise.
not my relationships.
what do you think they're talking about?
I can think of a few things I'd like to say to Se?±or Rivera.
things that would probably get you arrested.
it wouldn't be the first time.
is Rivera smiling?
saw a cat smile like that once.
agent Gibbs.
what an unexpected surprise.
how's your sister, Alejandro?
considering the stress of the situation, it's nice to see you in good spirits.
Seor Rivera.
what are you doing here?
Abby, would you believe I came to see you?
um... no.
you know, I never did get that report.
well, I've told you multiple times that I sent it. Really, I did.
you know, it's funny.
ms. Hart was looking into the situation as well, and now she's out of the country.
I assume you have another printout of your findings.
no, there was just one.
you know, I'm terribly disappointed with how things turned out.
but look at me rambling.
it's late, and you should get home. Yeah, be careful.
the roads can be dangerous at night.
what did you just say?
nothing inappropriate, I hope.
you want to threaten someone, you can threaten me.
not the people I work with.
your team can be hotheaded and reactionary, Director.
they're not doing you any favors. - Let me do you one.
somebody show Sir Rivera out, before he gets hurt.
by whom? - By me.
I wish I had never gone to Mexico, never offered to help Alejandro.
I wish I had never finished that damn report.
he's just trying to get inside your head, Abbs.
Oh, he is inside my head, Gibbs, and he's making himself right at home.
not going to let anything happen to you.
Jethro, I'm glad I caught you.
look at this.
that's a Mexican Day of the Dead doll.
Precisely-- Day of the Dead-- and I just found it neatly tucked against my windshield.
I've got one, too.
a message perhaps from this afternoon's unwelcome guest?
Yeah. Gibbs.
don't look forward to the day you stop suffering because when it comes, you'll know you're dead.
got more Tennessee Williams for me, Paloma?
you remember how much I enjoy his work, Gibbs.
I hope you are enjoying mine.
Gibbs, are you all right?
McGee. Trace my last incoming call.
on it.
Darren, you stay with them, you stay with them.
give me a location.
locking onto the signal.
it's right outside your house.
get a hold of the agents detailed to my dad.
boss, it's, it's just ringing. They're not picking up.
get Dinizzo, get Ziva, get 'em there now, go!
what's wrong, son?
we were down in the basement.
one is dead, the other injured.
paramedics are on the way.
Tony's putting out a BOLO on Paloma.
you mean she was here?
why didn't she just finish the job?
because she's not done yet.
one of my agents is dead.
I'm sorry, but I... Don't tell me you don't know anything about it.
where is she?
if I knew, would I still be here?
would I be so interested in striking a deal?
I'm willing to give you all this information...
you go after my father and then you go after my team?
does your sister want a fight? Because if she does, let's settle this right now.
she's got one.
special Agent Gibbs, I was merely having dinner as a guest in your country.
are you really threatening a representative of the Mexican government?
I don't know, am I?
Mr. Ambassador, we have a situation.
Gibbs, Se?±or Rivera must be tired.
come on, Leon... - No.
we're done... for now.
it's time to avenge our father's death.
I'm sorry about your agent.
Yeah.
the other man?
he's stable.
dad, I can stop this.
but I'm gonna need your help.
whatever it takes.
okay. Let's go fishing.
Gibbs is moving his father to the safe house at Church Creek.
isolated.
let's keep it on the down-low.
no e-mails, no interoffice communication.
new protection detail?
assigning one. For now, Gibbs will be with him. They should be safe.
go inform your team.
Yes, sir.
well, so far Alejandro is nothing but predictable.
so what is he doing now?
he is making an encrypted call to a cell phone that's on the move.
the same one Paloma used before?
no, different one.
call Gibbs, tell him the eagle has landed.
okay, everything's ready.
doesn't matter where we go. A woman like this won't stop till she gets what she's after.
you talking from personal experience?
I've run from a few women in my time.
chased a few, too. - When we get there, what happens?
we wait.
you sure this is going to work, probie?
no.
hello. - Seor Rivera.
director Vance, what can I do for you?
I'd like to discuss a diplomatic compromise.
did I never tell you about the first case that Jethro and I worked?
two sailors capsized a recreational skiff one summer's eve.
panic ensued.
when they were finally located, one sailor was dead and the other severely hypothermic.
so the one sailor drowned?
no. Rather than watch his friend slowly expire, one sailor stabbed the other.
Yeah, claiming that it was more humane.
he was convinced that his actions were justified.
like Gibbs 20 years ago. - Yeah.
Ducky, what if this doesn't work?
what's gonna happen to Gibbs?
in 1940, Winston Churchill sat in his bunker smoking one of those majestic cigars, waiting for news that the first German bombs were decimating London.
let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties," he said over the radio.
and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire "and its commonwealth lasts for a thousand years, men will still say,'This was their finest hour.
the hour is upon us, Abby.
all we can do is wait and see.
let me assure you, Director, you're making a wise decision.
this kind of combined effort between our countries sends a powerful message to the international drug community.
one of my agents is dead, and your sister's going home.
what kind of positive message is that?
what we do is necessary for the greater good.
there's nothing good about this.
excuse me for the interruption, sir.
details.
unconfirmed.
Gibbs?
he's okay. He's gonna lay low. Spend the night in the safe house.
um, is everything all right, Director?
Se?±or Rivera, something's come up.
we're gonna have to continue this at another time.
there's an agent outside who'll show you out.
of course.
anything? - He saw the note.
he keeps trying to call Paloma, but I'm blocking reception.
no text messages either.
he thinks she's not answering.
all right, where is she now?
looks like she's headed for the safe house in Church Creek.
Gibbs' plan to catch her may actually work.
drop the weapon!
on your knees!
get down on the ground!
I did this for my sister!
to finish what she started.
Gibbs? No, they said you were in there.
nobody said we were inside this safe house.
you killed my sister.
no, but someone was in there, right?
who? Who was in there?
Paloma... Paloma... - I'll call an ambulance.
Paloma... No, perdname.
will you walk into my parlor? "said the spider to the fly.
do you know that poem, Gibbs?
Leyla and Amira are waiting for you.
don't miss your flight.
much obliged, Director.
appreciate you staying to help.
sure.
thought maybe we could fix a few things.
you sure you can spare the time?
do what you have to for family.
ain't that the truth?
watch it.
she can't stop me. I gotta keep moving. I can't let them find me.
I can't...
come on. Come on.
no, wait!
no, tell me.
sweetheart, I don't get embarrassed.
you little vixen.
I hope you warmed that up first.
listen, I gotta go.
uh, pick you up tonight, say, 8:00?
great.
Ciao.
who's the lucky little vixen, Tony?
adult relationship stuff, McTween. You wouldn't understand.
adult relationship? You?
he must be dating one of those late-night chat girls again.
she was a student putting herself through medical school.
hmm, I have now lost my appetite.
Ethel's different. She's special.
special Ethel?
good, Tony. You're finally dating within your age range.
happens to be a family name.
and I happen to like it.
it's strong, distinguished.
it says... - "I've fallen and I can't get up"?
laugh all you want, but I think Ethel and I really have something.
well, there are antibiotics for that, Tony.
she's even started... I can share this.
she's even started talking about role-playing.
you're taking a drama class?
that's not the kind of role-playing he's talking about.
just don't you show up tomorrow wearing a diaper and carrying a whip. Okay?
Oh, that kind of role-playing.
so, what is she into?
she's keeping it a secret till Halloween.
says it's gonna bring our relationship to a whole new level.
well, what if she wants you to dress up like a ballerina?
well, trust me.
this woman could get Gibbs into a tutu and a leotard if she wanted to.
not likely, in this lifetime, DiNozzo.
no, boss. I'm sure you would never wear a leotard.
but if you did, you could pull it off.
I'm gonna grab my gear.
good idea. Got a dead Navy lieutenant. Let's go.
heck of a way to catch a bus.
so, boss, uh, police think it was an accident.
bus driver claims that the, uh, victim tried to run the light and missed.
got an ID? -- Yeah.
navy Lieutenant Clea Thorson.
29 years old. Chemical Engineer.
two tours overseas before joining the Reserves in 2006.
I have a witness that says the victim was acting paranoid prior to the collision.
police have another who says she was mumbling to herself about trying to get away from someone.
mental problems?
maybe she really was running away from someone.
good morning, all.
to whom do we have the privilege?
navy Lieutenant Clea Thorson.
pedestrian versus bus.
how unfortunate.
walk on the green, not in-between.
I am so sorry. I-I used to say that to myself, uh, when I was a kid whenever I wandered into...
never mind. Never mind.
severe trauma to the head consistent with a collision.
the impact threw the victim 12 to 15 feet, making the speed of the bus at the point of collision...?
uh... 15 to 20 miles an hour.
are those scratches on her hands, Mr. Palmer?
naturally, she would have extended her arms to protect herself.
Oh, this is weird.
check the other arm.
some kind of chemical symbols?
looks like my cheat sheet from an eighth grade math final.
whatever this is, Mr. Palmer,
I am certain that you did not learn it in eighth grade.
seems Lieutenant Thorson was something of an overachiever.
background.
graduated first in her class from MIT.
while she was in the service, she led a civil engineering project to rebuild water systems in Iraq.
she was 21.
recruited by every biotech firm in the country.
she chose Martin Stillwell's Gen-1 Biotech, Inc. in DC.
she was working on a research project there until two weeks ago.
fired. We're not sure why.
a spotless military record.
family? -- Never married.
no children. No boyfriend to speak of.
only relative is her mother in Boston.
she's in the air as we speak.
well, boss, no current home address in the database.
most recent is from about six months ago.
no cell phone or credit card trails, either.
but I did find a bank account registered to her in Maryland.
she made several recent deposits-- all over $20,000, and all within the last two weeks.
after Stillwell fired her.
could've been working for someone on the sly.
find out who was paying her.
I really appreciate you guys letting me do this.
I mean, don't get me wrong, Tony's pictures are great.
I just... I need specifics.
oddly Diane Arbus to me.
wow, I love her.
I'll take that as a compliment.
how great is "Child With Toy Grenade in Central Park"?
Mmm, I worship "Triplets in Their Bedroom."
Totally!
I worship getting my work done.
holy mother of Einstein!
there's a pattern here.
I would love to know what it is.
Ah, Jethro. Thank goodness.
never seen anything like this before, Gibbs. I'm not sure exactly what it is.
did she write it, or did someone else do it?
I don't know that yet, either.
it's just... it's an... indecipherable puzzle.
that's what makes it so cool.
my point is, it's gonna take me a while to process all this, so...
right. Off I go.
Bye. -- Bye, Abbs.
I'm afraid we're not finished yet, Jethro.
but what I've discovered so far really bothers me.
broken capillaries in both eyes.
her skin is extremely dehydrated.
both of these are unrelated to the blunt force trauma she incurred at the accident.
this was a very sick woman, Jethro.
Mr. Palmer, would you...?
her spleen expanded to nearly twice its size.
the liver and pancreas are also enlarged.
she had almost complete organ failure.
from what?
some kind of poison.
I have no idea what kind.
Abby will start tests.
but whatever it was, it's been in her system for some time.
she was dying.
I-I have no idea how the poison got into her system.
it didn't get there by itself.
whoever did this to her knew just what to do not to get caught.
come on, DiNozzo, give me something.
uh, no luck on the money trail, boss. -- McGee?
found several IM's in Thorson's e-mail cache.
one's video.
you ungrateful bitch.
you're not going anywhere.
and if you do leave me, I will make your life hell!
Mel Gibson much?
there was no evidence that Lieutenant Thorson had a boyfriend.
McGee? -- Yep, finding the IP address.
okay, uh, this is not her boyfriend; that's her boss.
you know, you're out of your mind if you think I had something to do with Clea's death.
no, actually, you are. We got the video message to prove it.
easy, tiger.
guy could go a little nuts after getting dumped, huh?
Clea and I had a professional relationship.
that's it. I gave her her break in this business; I nurtured her.
so, you don't deny you were close?
about the work? Yes.
you see, Clea was the most brilliant engineer I'd ever known and ever worked with.
but of course, what comes along with all that brilliance are certain... challenges.
what kind of challenges?
Clea never wanted to be a team player.
she had to do everything on her own in her own way, and that's not how I run things here.
she'd also become impossible to deal with, especially during our research project at Norfolk.
can you explain this research project?
my company was hired by the Navy to help them become fuel independent-- to go green, if you will.
well, no more dependence on foreign oil-- I like the sound of that.
well, essentially, the goal was to make sure every Naval base was completely off the grid by 2020.
well, that sounds like a large undertaking.
uh, it's massive, actually.
and you are...?
april Ferris. I'm an engineer here at Gen-1.
engineer... so you worked with Clea Thorson, then?
I did, for five years.
she was a friend.
it's awful what happened.
it is.
can you tell us about her last days here before she was... fired?
I'm sorry. I can't right now.
I've got a meeting that I need to get to.
and of course, any other questions can be answered by my attorney.
we're not done yet.
I believe we are.
who did this?
who killed my daughter?
was she in any trouble?
everything was fine.
Clea was just fine.
until she lost her job.
any idea why?
no.
but she kept sending money, telling me to keep it in case anything happened.
she was scared.
at first, I thought it was the meds, but this was different.
meds.
started when she was about four.
mood swings, manic behavior, insomnia.
she struggled till her early teens.
then we found the right doctor, the right medications, and everything was under control.
until recently.
that had to be hard.
something... had my daughter shaken up, Agent Gibbs.
and I don't think it was her illness.
do you have children?
did.
please tell me the pain goes away.
I've been going over the photos I took in autopsy.
see how the writing on the left arm is similar to that on the right, but it's angled funny?
it's two different people.
no, not people.
hands. Her own hands.
ambidextrous.
if the killer did this, then the handwriting would be exactly the same on both arms.
she wrote it all herself.
how's that for dedication?
I'm officially a fan.
there's more.
it's a formula.
or it's pieces of-of a longer, elaborate chemical formula.
I just don't know what it is yet.
and I'm stumped.
you want to know why?
cause it's a code inside a code.
and it was written so only she could understand it.
this is pure brilliance with a capital B.
or with a capital P. B. It's just one part of a bigger equation.
she did this for a reason.
she wanted to protect it.
look.
see these little numbers written in the crease of her elbow?
coordinates. -- Yeah.
Ding, ding, ding.
1649 Delaney Street Southeast.
Thanks.
someone was security conscious.
or paranoid.
maybe paranoid for a reason, huh?
we should get Abby out here.
you should see this, Tony.
left us a message.
I am a little concerned.
I have never seen Abby so... -- Quiet.
she's fine. She's just thinking.
I admit, it's a lot to absorb.
could take us weeks to process.
I've already counted three security cameras inside.
should be able to get whoever was in here on playback.
if somebody was in here.
I sense skepticism, Tony.
well, you sensed right, Dr. Phil.
think it's the same formula? -- McGee, hi.
Yes. I mean, no, no.
it's not the same.
well, part of it is.
this is actually an extension of what's on her body.
this is the second piece of the formula.
just-- I've never seen someone so focused before.
Oh, I have.
in a good way, I mean.
talking about you, Abbs.
go. I have to check the hard drive.
okay. Ziva, anything here?
well, Lieutenant Thorson was definitely having problems with Stillwell.
look. She writes that he was watching her every move.
what about the Norfolk project?
nothing. Maybe Stillwell had her too scared to write about it.
maybe Alice took a few too many pills in Wonderland.
Hey, bite your tongue.
respect, please.
sorry, Abbs, I just think we need to consider the possibility that Lieutenant Thorson's paranoia was imagined.
her hard drive's been erased.
is that a euphemism?
they used a remote device to erase the hard drive.
I don't think that is imagined.
someone was stealing her work.
well, boss, say hello to the Green Hornet.
the first F-18 jet fueled by 50% biofuel.
tested off the charts last spring.
Stillwell's company involved?
Yeah, his and about 20 others. The Navy's investing billions.
check it out.
thermonuclear power, wind energy, geothermal power, hybrid ships...
you name it.
companies are in a race to patent new technologies.
Yeah, and whoever gets the patents first makes a fortune.
Oh, yeah. Daddy Warbucks kind of fortune.
Thorson's project could've been worth enough to get her killed.
money trail.
all deposits were strictly cash.
whoever was paying her did not want to be found.
prints in the loft. -- Just hers.
nothing off the security camera footage either.
only person I've seen so far is her.
time codes begin the day she was fired and end the day she died.
she locked herself away for two weeks.
she was dedicated to her cause.
obsessive.
now, Gibbs, I've found references to a Mr. K.
in her journals, as well as entries of meetings in a calendar.
any dates? -- Yeah.
several in the past two weeks.
find him.
check employees at Stillwell's company, Navy colleagues, anyone linked to this Norfolk project.
I can see a kindred spirit in you.
I mean, not that I can see your spirit, 'cause that would be weird.
but I guess not too weird 'cause you're in here, and you're, you know, you're...
um, anyway, uh, so what I'm trying to say is-is we communicate in the same way.
I could tell the first time I saw all of this.
everyone else saw chaos, and I-I saw patterns right away.
there was order to the chaos.
so...
I just, I want you to know that whatever it is that you're trying to tell me, I promise you, I promise I'll understand.
careful.
sometimes they talk back.
I just, I wanted to get one last look at the-the writings.
it's a rather fascinating case with a rather fascinating young woman.
we could study her brain for years and never know just what made her tick.
but, I suppose, that could be said for any one of us.
you all right?
you look a little peaked.
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
go home, Abby. Get some rest.
I can assure you of one thing:
lieutenant Thorson will still be here in the morning.
McGee! You're here.
I've had some breakthroughs.
or maybe it's more like some little bursts of inspiration.
cause if I had a breakthrough, that would mean I have all the answers, but I don't, not yet.
but I'm close. I know I am, because I can feel it.
I've got, like, this tingling feeling going up and down my spine.
how many Caf-POWs you had today?
um, eleven-teen.
did you even go home last night?
I've been inputting the raw data from the writings, trying to crack the code to the formula, and then bam, it hit me.
that it's not about the code.
it's about her. What I need to crack is her.
the DTA bus line-- she rode it every week.
it's all in here.
and she wrote about a-a college mentor.
I don't know where he is, but I think he was her confidant.
and maybe he could tell us about Mr. K.
and you think we should find him?
lieutenant Thorson-- she had a whole life, out there somewhere.
she was on a journey. And it's my duty to follow it.
that's how we're gonna find out who killed her.
I can't do it alone, McGee.
I need you to come with me.
3:00 in the afternoon, she has a sandwich and a soda.
exactly 20 minutes later, she goes back to her desk.
6: 00 in the evening, she takes a shower.
same every day, like clockwork.
I know that sound.
what sound? I didn't make a sound.
it is the sound of things not boding well for poor Ethel.
I don't want to talk about it.
what's wrong? Are you having second thoughts about the role you're going to play?
she wants me to dress up like...
no, I can't. It's sacrilege.
I'm gonna have to end it.
Oh, come on, Tony, it's only been two days.
it's too short... even for you.
trust me, Ziva. There's some things a man should never do.
we're are not talking about a man here. We're talking about you.
did you let her know?
I need some time to process.
if you are going to end it, do it now.
it is not fair to just...
Tony, what is this?
miss Ferris. She called. I told her to come in.
does Stillwell know you're here? -- No.
keeps everyone around him on a pretty tight leash, huh?
in some ways, yes.
what about Lieutenant Thorson?
their relationship was very complicated.
and that's all I'll say.
what about your relationship with her?
we were the only women engineers at Gen-1.
she was a lot braver than I was. -- How so?
she wasn't afraid to stand up to Martin or anyone else.
I only wish I had known her better.
and how her mind worked. I...
uh, these are some of the things from her locker.
maybe you'll be able to find some of the answers I never could.
all right.
we' be in touch.
who was that?
lieutenant Thorson's colleague.
you get anything?
Yes.
I think we did.
a final meeting with Mr. K.
this one's scheduled for later this afternoon.
you got a location?
wiley's Cafe across town.
ABBY: The 35 should take us to 16th Street.
from there we can take the Red Line to DuPont Circle.
okay, Abby, we have been on five buses in the last two hours, okay?
this isn't working.
I need to find what I'm looking for, McGee.
Yeah, but you don't even know what you're looking for.
I mean, at least be pragmatic. Listen to yourself.
Clea took this path all the time.
I have find out why.
I thought you wanted to help me.
Abby, I do want to help you. I... Whoa!
bringing up the cell grid.
no hits where I last saw Abby. She must have turned her cell phone off.
she didn't just disappear into thin air, Tim.
I know, boss.
we'll find her.
how did you know where to find me?
I followed Lieutenant Thorson's path.
it only took me eight different buses and ten miles on foot to do it.
knowing Clea, she had a reason.
she was scared, Professor Redner.
someone was following her.
the same person that hurt her?
I was worried something had happened when she didn't show the other day.
so... she was on her way to see you when she died.
I can't believe that she's gone.
well, I don't think she is.
I mean, not totally.
look at this.
okay, she left all this behind.
do you have any idea what this means?
well, there's a focus on hydrogen, carbon dioxide, but the rest I don't, I don't recognize.
she kept her own projects secret, even from me.
She-she had to have shared something with you.
she trusted you.
she wrote about a Mr. K.
she mentioned him a few times, yes.
ever by his full name?
no. Sorry.
you know Clea gave me something a few years ago.
we would read from it during her visits.
it seemed calm her.
maybe it can do the same thing for you.
Oh, I-I couldn't take that. That was a gift.
science is poetry, Ms. Sciuto.
it's abmaking order... -- From chaos.
Yeah, that's what I do every day.
then this book is in good hands.
we are not sure what to believe at this point.
the meeting with Mr. K. wasn't quite what we hoped for.
he never showed? -- You could say that.
well, the restaurant manager confirmed Lieutenant Thorson was there many times these past two weeks.
dates correspond to meetings found in her calendar. Look.
we got video footage. -- Let's see it.
at first I thought maybe she was on her phone, but manager says that she stays like this for about an hour every time.
he kicked her out after a customer complained that she was getting too loud.
turn it off.
boss, Abby's turned her cell phone back on.
I'm gonna try and nail down her exact location.
last time we let you two out on a field trip.
is that Thorson meeting with... -- The notorious Mr. K?
Yes, it is. In the flesh, so to speak.
who's gonna tell Abby?
I nominate you.
I'll handle it.
well, someone will have to and quickly.
Abby, are you all right?
Gibbs, whirlwind of a day!
you wouldn't believe where I've been. You want to guess? Go for it.
Abby... -- Okay, I'll tell you.
so, I found Lieutenant Thorson's college mentor, Professor Daniel Redner.
he's a great guy. We talked about poetry, he made tea.
I loved the poetry, I hated the tea. -- Stop.
anyways, he knows all about Mr. K. And he said that Thorson was really secretive about him, which means that she felt threatened by him. So we have to find Mr. K.Gibbs!
stop!
you just raised your voice to me. You never raise your voice to me.
it's her delusion, Abbs.
...About you.
you don't understand.
none of you understand!
there's no reasoning with her.
I'm afraid not, Jethro.
not when she locks herself in her lab, convinced that she can find all the answers on her own.
right. Just like Thorson did.
well, there's no doubt that Abby greatly identifies with the lieutenant.
has done from the beginning.
it's a slippery slope, Duck.
Yeah. Well, as Nietzsche says,"When you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss will gaze into you."
I need to get her back.
you will.
we're still waiting results from the outside lab as to the type of poison.
however, this morning I pulled a piece of tissue from beneath one of Thorson's fingernails.
there a fight?
it could have been a nasty one.
the tissue was deeply imbedded.
you got an I.D?
just got that back.
boss, it's Stillwell.
get out of the car, Stillwell!
get out!
he's on the move!
help me!
Ducky's initial autopsy findings point to poison.
same way Thorson was killed.
same killer.
well, you know what? Maybe Thorson wasn't completely insane.
I mean, boss, we know that Thorson and Stillwell were both working to redesign energy systems for the Navy.
billions are at stake.
maybe Thorson's formula really is the key to all of this.
well, then, if that is true then Abby's the only one who can make this breakthrough.
somebody's gotta break through her first.
think I might know someone.
no matter where I was, I could always tell when Clea was in trouble.
my stomach got twisted up.
I didn't sleep. Didn't eat.
I knew something was wrong, but I never expected this.
she had a mission.
nothing was gonna stop her.
from what I hear, you feel the same way.
well, I promised your daughter that I would finish what she started.
at what cost, Ms. Sciuto?
Clea was a scientist above all else.
her work fed her.
gave her the happiness I never could, but it also drove her to the brink.
I'm not on the brink. I'm just looking for answers.
where? In my daughter's head?
I'd do anything to tell you how Clea's mind worked, but after 29 years and all the love a mother could possibly give, not even I can tell you that.
you connected to my daughter because of science.
Yes.
and you want to help her?
that's all I want to do.
then do what she would have done, and put emotion aside.
please, you have to let her go.
progress, Gibbs. Observe progress.
music to my ears, Abbs.
okay, after whittling away at the mass of symbols and letters, I kept coming back to two distinct chemical compositions.
the first was taken from the writings on the body.
it happens to be a unique construction of the bacteria E Coli.
right. Sorry.
inside voice. It just feels really good to have my mojo back.
okay, now behold the second composition.
it was found in the writings inside Thorson's loft.
and it is-- drumroll please-- a synthesis of compounds with the aid of radiant energy.
A.K.A. photosynthesis.
wait. So this is all about plants and bad meat?
Yeah, it's confusing, huh?
okay, next equation, stat. I mean please.
at first I thought this was about converting the organisms of E Coli into fuel, but there's too much carbon dioxide for that process to ever work.
in other words, my mojo has sort of hit a no-jo.
I still don't have the last piece of the formula.
I feel like I'm missing something, but I've been over this a million times.
this is our anomaly, boss.
and we still can't figure out where it fits in the formula.
looks like a plant.
it's not a plant, Gibbs.
it's a leaf.
a memory card.
whoa, guys.
Clea Thorson was a genius.
carbon dioxide wasn't the problem-- it was the solution.
she discovered a way to make fuel from bacteria.
this is revolutionary for green energy.
I mean, she's figured out how to power the planet out of stuff that we try to get rid of.
Avaxis employee list.
systems director Rupert Kritzer.
I told you there was a Mr. K.
Yes, she was working for me.
you paid her under the table. Why?
it's a cutthroat business.
it's the way it has to be done.
keep it hidden from Stillwell?
I know you were working on the Navy energy plan.
and I know that he was one of your main competitors.
it's complicated.
well, yeah. Two people are dead and you're the chief suspect.
doesn't get much more complicated than that.
look, the biotech business is this generation's dot-com boom, okay?
everyone is trying to discover the next big thing.
and everyone is looking for the next big talent.
talent like Lieutenant Thorson?
right. So when Stillwell fired her, I pounced, okay?
I told her to keep it to herself.
he'd stolen ideas from me before. I wasn't going to let him do that again.
I didn't want our project ever getting back to him.
Yeah, and when it did, you killed them.
had to keep it for yourself.
I didn't kill anyone.
I don't believe you.
Clea's bacteria conversion formula has just netted me $2 billion, Agent Gibbs.
I was just about to hire her for a second project.
why would I want her dead?
martin Stillwell's throat was burned from swallowing a significant amount of something.
so much, in fact, that you can still smell it.
gasoline.
dead bodies.
close.
it's a highly refined version of ethanol mixed with traces of formaldehyde.
where would somebody get something like that?
they can't.
Mr. Palmer.
with Abby's help, I found a patent filing from three years ago for a grain-based fuel called Nanathol.
but the patent was never given because the fuel left behind the deadly by-product of...
formaldehyde.
who filed it?
Stillwell's company.
well, Palmer, find out who spearheaded the project.
go, now, go.
on it.
additionally, Jethro, Lieutenant Thorson was not poisoned the same way as Martin Stillwell.
hers was more methodical.
Meaning?
meaning she absorbed the poison through her skin over a period of two weeks.
possibly mixed in a lotion or some kind of liquid.
and done by someone who knew her rituals.
precisely.
every day at 6: 00 in the evening Lieutenant Thorson took a shower.
it did not change for two weeks, but here's what did change.
this is the day before she died.
she's getting sicker by the minute.
Hey, Tony.
I think McGee found something.
I'm at some pipes underneath the stairs outside Thorson's loft.
goes right into the water supply.
she never had a chance, boss.
look who's taking center stage.
ms. Ferris, we need to talk to you.
uh, I'm in the middle of a meeting. Can't it wait?
gentlemen.
I don't understand.
I've told you all I know. I've helped you.
no, you only helped yourself, ma'am.
to a brand-new job it looks like.
must feel good to finally be the one in charge.
doesn't suit you, though.
you're more of a background player.
I've worked hard for what I have.
no, the work only got you so far.
lieutenant Thorson-- she was the real deal.
you're a phony.
we were never competitors.
Clea was my friend.
at least that's what she thought.
this is a direct quote from her journal.
I feel alone at Gen-1 most of the time.
I do not like it here.
but April makes the days easier.
maybe we will be friends.
I trust her.
she never said...
she didn't care about me.
it's a terrible thing-- betraying someone's trust like that.
you have no idea what I had to put up with.
people fawned over her like she was the Second Coming.
how do you think that made me feel?
make you feel bad enough to kill.
it's Tony as Tony.
I am completely impressed.
are you supposed to be Fat Elvis?
it's Saturday Night Fever.
Travolta,'77.
in a John Badham directed classic.
I know!
looks ridiculous, right?
it feels even worse.
it's like I'm betraying the gods.
I was not aware you were so religious.
the film gods.
so I take it this means you haven't ended things with Ethel?
a man's got to do what a man's got to do.
I'm gonna give Special Ethel what she thinks she wants.
but this...
this will always belong to me.
looks good.
I like it.
I'm just trying to get in the spirit.
it's more "me.
look, Gibbs, I'm sorry... I'm sorry that I am... I'm sorry.
it's okay.
don't move! Don't move! -- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
it's just some clothes and, like, DVDs!
I'll return them!
what's NCIS?
I can't believe some people have never heard of us.
you're under arrest for espionage and terrorism.
wait, what?!
pretty cool piece of tech.
takes advantage of the new credit cards designed so you can swipe your whole wallet over the sensor when you make a purchase.
because that extra four seconds it takes to remove your credit card is just plain un-American. This doesn't work.
the point is that you control the card, which in theory reduces fraud risk at point of purchase.
still won't keep you hacky types from stealing my numbers from the matrix, anyway.
look at it, doesn't work.
that's right.
you should still be terrified of my kind.
I refuse to be afraid of 22-year-old girls, no matter what kind of magical pick-pocketing devices they're sporting.
you know who the real victim is?
artistry.
if someone wants something out of your pants, they should have to use their hands.
the thing about all this virtual thievery is it's virtually impossible to virtually police.
how do you keep the DiCaprio out of your head?
mm, yeah, he is dreamy.
hillary Lange picked two dozen credit cards in less than an hour, she burned all the accounts onto a blank one, went shopping.
no one would have known if she hadn't picked the absolute wrong pocket.
Yep.
card number flagged on the terror watch list.
that's God's justice right there.
you think the pickpocket can lead you to the cardholder?
it'd be easier if you gave me a name.
name would just be fake, but the account's real.
I'm gonna be tied up at this review conference all week.
Oh, there's a good time.
reviewing old case files.
well, it may sound dull, but it's a useful educational tool.
also helps maintain continuity within the agency.
we are responsible for the work performed by our predecessors.
Tom Morrow called me about lunch.
well, he's not gonna have time. Neither will you.
three bodies coming in from the Coast Guard.
suspected smugglers shot off the coast of Florida. One's a Navy officer.
all the physical evidence is en route to Ms. Sciuto.
well, I usually like an invite to a crime scene.
it sank in the Gulf of Mexico.
you do plan on talking to that girl, don't you?
well, she is accused of terrorism.
she'll talk when she's ready to talk.
hey... you okay?
I think it's time.
okay, I'll give you whatever you want!
just talk to me! Hello?!
do you guys know that when people walk by those signs that say "Beware Pickpocket,"
they always tap where their wallet is back pocket, chest, coat.
artistry.
a would-be artisan went for my wallet once in Rome.
you need to get the device closer to their wallets, all right?
you realize a 22-year-old girl had this mastered.
people mature much faster these days, McGee.
Yeah, present company excluded.
that's not the guy. Keep going.
we cannot really be sure that, because this girl crossed paths with him here yesterday, we will cross paths with him today.
also can't be sure that Gibbs will be swilling coffee when we get back to the office or you'll fumble a simple American expression or that McGee will sleep alone tonight, but people do tend to follow patterns.
wait, wait, we got a match.
the last person you scanned.
which one? -- Turning right.
popped collar. -- Alley on 17th, McGee.
pull the van around. That's our terrorist.
whoever this guy is, he gets around.
the card's been used everywhere, from the Middle East to Latin America to the Caribbean.
Tony. --Ninja senses tingling?
NCIS, drop your weapon! -- Hands in the air!
put it down! -- You put down your weapon.
Hello, Ziva.
Oh, good, the Israelis are back.
Liat It's like music.
in Hebrew, it means "you are the one for me," Tony.
my name roughly translates to "two parts of a leg."
Liat is one of the most common names in Israel.
where only the grandmothers are named Ziva.
so what brings you to DC?
the cherry blossoms.
that's in the spring, actually.
I'm afraid all we have to offer in November are elections and pardoned turkeys.
I really like those boots, Liat. Not speaking too fast for you, am I?
I understand.
you're very, uh, tongue-in-ear.
she means tongue-in-cheek.
don't put words in the girl's mouth.
we are on vacation.
tourists have their passports scanned, they don't carry firearms and clearly this is the new Ziva.
in Mossad.
your replacement.
did you expect we would never move on after you left us?
you left me.
let's not get hung up on who's left, who's right and who's wrong.
let's get back to the original question.
what are you doing here? -- Hey, boss.
uh, we were just having a pretty good time lying to each other, and I think that was about to boil off, actually.
if you intend to detain us any longer, I would like to hear a statement of cause.
you're terrorists.
that is absurd.
not according to our director, who saw you coming from a mile away.
losing your touch, Mal.
you're in the United States illegally.
you're immigration now, Special Agent Gibbs?
deport us then.
take them in. Figure out how they got here.
do not need to wait for me.
outsiders are not allowed to be unaccompanied in this building.
Ah, congratulation on becoming an insider.
must be very proud.
I am.
and your family? How do they feel?
you know, you were personally selected by my father to filla vacancy in his roster, not his bloodline.
and trust me, the second part is not something you want to covet.
you read up on me.
you spent eight months in paramilitary operations, helping to develop the new Galil assault rifle.
you won the marksmanship ribbon for your outfit four consecutive times.
I have six.
but I'm not done.
benefit of youth.
see, I would expect you to look into past conduct.
but you seem to only to care about my abilities with a gun.
you have a pet cat.
named Bill.
I happen to like cats.
still, I feel this, uh, measuring contest would be more at home in the men's room.
don't you think?
heard you got a shipment in, Duck.
the three bodies we were expecting from the Gulf.
you're fluent in chicken scratch.
perhaps you can make out this scrawl.
maybe some sort of acronym?
C.I.W.S. Close-In Weapons System.
so a Coast Guard cutter opened fire on a pleasure fishing craft?
with a Gatling gun?
claims these guys fired first.
who's this?
captain Caleb Burnett.
he was on leave, helping his brother pay the bills.
coast Guard approached three miles off the coast of Florida.
saw crates being thrown overboard, hailed a warning.
then the fireworks.
gulf Coast oil spill wreaked havoc on the fishing business.
turned to smuggling?
would you believe that human and animal hair has been found to be one of the most effective agents in cleaning up the oil?
I mean, from across the country, over half a million pounds of hair has been donated by barber shops, salons and pet stores.
says the dark-haired guy was the shooter.
according to the Coast Guard report.
but they may have that wrong.
Abby didn't find any gunshot residue on this man's hands.
and I just sent swabs out from the other two, for analysis.
what else did CGIS miss?
well, I found an anomaly on the back of this man's skull.
large caliber rounds would inflict this sort of damage, but not that small hole.
and that is stippling.
I got no clue what they were smuggling.
port of origin was near Havana.
maybe they were smuggling cigars.
drugs. Drugs are always good.
pirates do like rum.
it's not a guessing game.
tell me you got something, Abbs.
well, I got a lot, Gibbs.
I mean, with our mystery smugglers and our Mossad operatives in their dark clothing, sticking to the shadows.
yeah,'cause that hasn't gotten old.
black on black never goes out of style, Gibbs, just so you know.
but it would be nice if they would play things, you know, above the board every once in a while.
although, last time Netanyahu was in town, they did everything according to standard protocol and then the airlines lost a bag of his advance team's guns.
personally, I-I don't like losing things.
did I just give you a clue?
it's what you do, Abbs.
then let me give you more.
these are the slugs pulled from the boat.
there's a handful of nine-millimeters mixed in with the Coast Guard's 20-mill big boys.
was kind of a bad idea to shoot at a cutter with a nine-millimeter.
it's like trying to put out a forest fire with a Super Soaker. Right?
right. Um, so...
I went through all three of our victims, and there's no corresponding GSR.
smugglers never fired a shot.
well, not these guys.
the nine-millimeter might match the anomaly that Ducky found in the captain's skull at close range.
captain and crew were executed on the boat.
shooter fires at the cutter.
goes into the water with the crates.
empty, which suggests that whatever was being smuggled has floated away.
or whoever swam away.
breathing holes.
somebody could have gotten caught trying to sneak somebody into the country, and then those somebodies...
are still unaccounted for.
crew was killed as a smoke screen.
and they swam to shore the last three miles under the cover of night.
that's dark.
even for black on black.
you know about the three bodies downstairs, killed in transit from Cuba to Florida?
why would we -- Don't.
their murder was a distraction to occupy the Coast Guard on the surface while their cargo swam to shore.
you killed Americans to get here?
your boss did not send you here to kill smugglers.
who were in the crates?
who are you tracking?
three members of a Palestinian terror network.
you followed them from Cuba?
then why do you search for them in DC?
they're not.
they're a step ahead of the assassins already.
they're an advance team.
you're right.
they are assassins.
and this is where their target will be.
who is their target?
your father is coming.
he'll be here in two days.
my father has not left Israeli soil in 12 years.
we are not lying.
we got three killers to find.
you get DiNozzo and McGee caught up.
I'm going to stock up.
it's going to be a long night.
officer Hadar.
you almost made me spill my coffee.
americans - you can never just say hello.
how about "Shalom"?
hello and good-bye.
and peace, Agent Gibbs.
not a lot of that when you're around.
do you have a minute to sit down with my director?
please, come with me. He's waiting for you.
tea and coffee.
there was a time when this conversation would take place over something a bit more exciting.
I'm still on the clock. No one's stopping you.
but, along with several other vices, drinking is now part of my past.
do you know that they say about a man with no vices?
Yes. He has incredibly annoying virtues.
which one brings you to town?
loyalty. I was summoned.
Vance's review of the international case files and his request for contributions from every NCIS director.
not every director.
no.
not Jenny Shepard.
she was truly responsible for bringing our organizations together.
and for bringing my daughter into your life.
but I am not here for her.
for Ziva. -- Yes.
you're not here for Ziva. She has a name.
I am aware. I gave it to her.
director Vance has a suite at the Freemont.
he's got a system where he can videoconference any agent who couldn't attend personally.
you didn't have to make the trip.
there is a case.
Amsterdam. --Then you do know.
no, just bits. Pieces.
for the first time, all parties involved will peel back the veil.
this a witch hunt?
with you wearing the pointy hat?
it may be necessary for me to defend myself.
need a lot of that.
the assassins- I am surprised- and not unimpressed- that they have made it this far.
but I am not concerned.
my people will ensure my safety.
Nope.
already got three bodies on the slab.
you should have told us you were coming.
but, like it or not, protecting you is my responsibility.
a joint effort, I think.
the three remaining members of the Palestinian Resistance Front, an anti-Zionist group responsible for many Israeli deaths.
we've spent years tracking them.
and still there are three.
no, there are only three.
I assure you, when they started, there were many more.
explosives expert.
intel specialist.
Abasi El Masri, their leader.
el Masri is trained in NATO weaponry and has a degree in advanced engineering.
I don't care how many degrees he has.
if he's serious about assassinating Eli, he's going to need something more than a pistol.
Tony, it is not about the size of the gun... -- It is about the will of the shooter.
we will make sure they do not succeed.
if necessary, we will place ourself in the line of fire.
all someone needs is the willingness to trade his life for mine.
you know -- In the Line of Fire.
kennedy said that.
why don't you just memorize your lines and don't bump into the furniture, McBartlett.
Spencer Tracy said that.
why isn't Secret Service or the State Department handling Director David's protection detail?
the director does not want anyone to know he's coming.
a bang-up job, I'd say.
how did they find out?
what?
no big, fat lie ready to go?
you really don't know.
which case files are we looking at?
are we talking 1988 or '98?
we finished with '88 an hour ago, Ben.
if you consult your schedule, you'll also notice the upcoming lunch break.
if the rest of us can wait...
Yeah, the rest of you are on the East Coast, Leon.
it's breakfast time in Mazatlan.
it's dinnertime here, and I'm holding off.
Plus, I am dangerously close to missing my dinner reservation.
all right, if we'll open the file code-named Leviathan.
uh, for the record, I was not involved directly in that case, so...
any, uh, observations I have about it are purely impartial, so...
damn it. I brought the wrong cane.
other cane's got the flask.
Hey, Riley.
Where'd they dig you up?
this will keep you sharper.
Oh, please. The coffee here is weaker than a Frenchman's handshake.
you ever heard of Tristan da Cunha?
Yeah. Neither did the rest of the world, or so I thought.
archipelago in the South Atlantic.
I was building a mission there.
haven't installed the phone lines yet.
okay... Former Agent McCallister will take over while I take a short break.
Oh, look at this - I get to play schoolteacher again.
all right, everybody, shut up.
Robinson, put those huevos away.
Nelson, feet off the table.
my bad. Forgot you could see me.
how you doing, Roy?
bodies from the Gulf were all executed at close range.
by whom? Not the Coast Guard.
three Palestinians they were smuggling into the United States.
Amsterdam on today's docket, Leon?
not till Friday.
Eli's here already, isn't he?
you knew he'd come.
you dangle the right bait, you can catch any game.
palestinians are following the same logic.
chasing Eli.
that was unexpected.
we got to find them first. Then we need to get on Eli's protection detail.
I know he's going to make it miserable for us.
got McGee babysitting him in a safe house.
we're running drills to secure the hotel.
good.
how's our own David handling it?
her father left her to die in a desert.
so it's a problem?
would be for me.
won't be for Ziva.
a sniper across the street would have a shot into any room on this side.
chemical agent could be disseminated through the air ducts.
take out a whole floor.
could spiral down from the roof.
too many access points to cover.
nobody protects you quite like a trained killer.
they certainly know all the moves.
how long have you and Liat been together as partners?
you must be her first.
partner, I mean.
she is young.
what she lacks in experience, she makes up for with a passion unlike I have ever seen.
am I sensing something between the two of you?
nothing serious.
you haven't slept together then?
Oh, of course we are sleeping together.
it's just nothing serious.
got to get back to Israel.
next year, Jerusalem, my friend.
Yeah.
given my father's many enemies, we would have been better served with advance notice.
do you include yourself?
among his enemies?
I'm doing a threat assessment.
I wonder if protecting his life is an appropriate assignment for you.
let us find out.
we will walk the garage approach.
I will play my father, you will try to kill me.
out front is far too visible.
we are assessing feasibility of a subterranean approach.
the corridor is primary, service entrance, secondary.
it is the best way to predict all possible attack angles, Gibbs.
I will be playing my father, Tony, Malachi and Liat are the assassins.
okay. Your father has a bodyguard.
so follow me, Director David.
we do not like that area because of the vulnerability at the apex.
west side, last car on the left.
Oh, come on!
there are different techniques for protecting a young man and an older man.
I would imagine he would move more slowly than he once did.
convertible.
one more shooter left.
truck!
a three-man team is one thing...but we should not be so na ve as to assume that means only three guns.
I'm dead... but so are you.
home safe from the safe house, I see - with sandwiches.
I've had had a very educational morning.
good,'cause Liat killed Gibbs and Ziva.
meatballs.
we killed you first, Tony.
Oh, I've seen it a million times.
the pretty, popular girl gets jealous when the hot new transfer comes in and steals all the spotlight.
it's pretty much a staple of every high school movie from the '70s and '80s:
Heathers, Fast Times... -- Who got jealous in Fast Times?
God, I like Phoebe Cates.
What'd Eli David have to say?
well, he said that, in Israel, they call backgammon "Shesh Besh."
but I actually did learn something.
turns out that, before becoming Eli's personal cleaner, and right-hand man, Officer Amit Hadar infiltrated the PRF.
now, he said their intel guy, Ashor, was preoccupied with American transports down the East Coast.
he thinks they're gonna go for firepower before they take their shot.
it's a good theory.
Tim-Amit; palindromic pals.
now, the Palestinians' last known location is a thousand miles south of DC.
now every major and minor airport in between has their photos posted.
I've got alerts at the train stations, bus stations, local LEOs up and down the coast as well as any and all hardware shipments, commercial or military.
I have hung a net.
I do not know who "Annette" is or why you are so proud of killing her.
no, what I mean is, if they make a move, we're gonna know about it.
all right.
send the manifest. We're on the way.
transport truck just got hijacked near Fort A.P. Hill.
army contractor.
well, see? We know about it.
take over the investigation of the weapons hijacking.
it's connected to our terrorist pursuit.
el Masri's got his weapons, he just needs a window.
then let's make sure they're all tightly shut.
you ever consider shifting this conference to the Navy Yard?
these guys are here to kill Eli David.
as tempting as that may be to facilitate...
I don't want to have to explain to the people in this room that my team can't secure a hotel from three terrorists.
leon, if this is a matter of pride... - It's a matter of principle, Gibbs.
we stand on their shoulders.
these people built the integrity of NCIS.
they did their work honorably, consistently and transparently.
and I'll be damned if that's gonna change on my watch.
there something going on I should know about?
no, Gibbs, everything's just fine.
we'll be covering the first chapters of my career.
I bet you'd just love to have a committee of people who had, wanted, or actively want your job combing through mistakes you made when you were 27.
yeah? So why do it?
protect the guy we invited, find the ones we didn't.
you got any more questions, ask Eli.
Ziva, besides the crow, how many carbines?
uh, five were still in the truck.
that leaves the hijackers with... six Sig Sauers.
seven assault rifles, an XM-320 grenade launcher, body armor and a spike antitank guided missile.
that's stacking up to be a lot less precision attempt and more Wile E. Coyote.
you know, more and more elaborate, out-of-proportion tactics?
did you know Wile E. Coyote was based on a character out of a Mark Twain book?
it's true. Twain described the coyote as a living, breathing "allegory of want."
as fanatical as the three we're looking for.
did the Director agree to a change of venue?
Ah, the conference stays put.
I guess he'd rather we... do our jobs?
all right, now, boss, this is the thing that we really, really need to worry about.
it's a lighter, modified version of the Common Remotely Operated Weapon.
it has a thermal-imaging system, state-of-the-art sensor and camera.
crow can be equipped with multiple machine guns.
mounted and controlled off location, it can turn one man into...a one-man army. I got it.
like Liat demonstrated.
now, I can bring up the... -- Boss! Hi, guys.
just found a stolen car abandoned in Friendship Heights.
it looks like it might be the one the Palestinians used in the hijacking.
had it towed in.
what is that smell?
well, I've got every reason to believe that these guys didn't leave this car from the time they stole it.
now, that was two days ago, in Florida.
they've racked up a lot of mileage since then. It's an old model, so there's no GPS.
I can't determine their exact route, but I would wager that it wasn't interstates.
old school... with a twist.
did any of them have an engineering background?
Yes. The leader.
looks like he rigged this up on the fly with parts you can get at a truck stop.
it's a refueling system.
they did not stop any more than they absolutely had to.
I've pulled some hair samples.
I'm certain they're gonna correspond with the hair samples from the crates.
I mean, it's the same guys.
Yes, these men are hunters.
Yeah. And if you've ever spent an entire day in a deer blind, you know that you do not want to open those - ugh.
you should see your dad.
how would that help the case?
Oh, it... it wouldn't.
have you even spoken to him?
no.
okay.
what does it matter to you?
do you think it's just by chance that he came back into your life?
I mean, what about Gibbs and his father, and Tony?
just comes a point, you know, in your lifetime where...
where they come back into your life...
because... because they matter to you.
and because you matter to him.
I mean, I suppose that-that sounds complicated but believe me it's not nearly as complicated as knowing that they're never ever gonna come back again.
Amit, you're killing me.
Oh, prison guard has come to check up on us.
Hadar, no one taught you. You let your boss win.
hiding him does not make him safe.
al-masri has been waiting years for the directive to step away from home.
they will find him.
somewhere on a piece of paper, it has been written.
a schedule, the name Eli David, where and when.
they prey on human error.
you ever make any of those, Eli?
in Israel, I travel with a team of armed guards behind four-inch bulletproof glass, separating me from the world like a sweatbox, even in autumn.
I was looking forward... to the chill of an East Coast winter.
I understand the air here is different.
open a window.
I even bought gloves for the occasion.
agent Gibbs, I'm just saying I would like to go for a walk.
I ask for a walk, I get a tour of your city.
I'm not complaining.
movement gets the blood flowing, stimulates the mind.
it can even create the illusion... of freedom.
I'm a magician.
well, I cannot disagree with that, Agent Gibbs.
you have a way of making my family disappear.
it's all about perspective.
peanut? -- No, thank you.
this is a fool's errand.
well, first rule of fishing - patience is everything.
a fishing expedition.
you saw what they did to the last fishermen they encountered.
um... All units report.
position one, all clear.
position two... possible vehicle match at the end of the street.
Liat, you're on it?
on my way.
all right, running plates. Liat, check it out.
I'm here.
I got to hand it to your father, Ziva.
he has who knows how many guns trained on him right now, and he is completely oblivious.
no, he's aware.
he is always aware of what he does.
not caring about the consequences is what makes him who he is.
plates are stolen. Liat, you got a visual?
position three. Car's empty.
Liat, your 6: 00. I have a visual on Ramzi Ashor.
I got no shot.
what about the other two?
Liat's got a bead on one. Searching for the others.
I see the second one, Yasin.
Gibbs, take cover.
move! Now! -- Out of the way!
drop your weapon.
Ziva, talk to me.
you tell me where is he? Where is the third?
you did good.
Toda. So did you.
you consider yourself heroic?
this is a minor interruption.
Eli David will be eliminated.
I will not reveal anything.
Yeah, I know. Where's El Masri?
you could not possibly know the sort David is.
Oh, yeah, he's an awful son of a bitch, everybody knows that.
I'm still not going to let you murder him.
it's not murder.
it's war.
I pity you Americans, because you inherited it.
you tried to reason your way into it.
economically, politically, theoretically.
but we have seen the blood.
we have heard the cries.
our war is here.
you two were on patrol.
you left El Masri alone.
no backup, no support.
nothing but a pile of stolen weapons.
so is that where he is?
he's placing weapons?
do you know where Eli David is supposed to be today?
the answer to both is the same.
Eli David will be lying dead in the street.
and Abasi El Masri will be standing over him.
Leon. --Yes.
this is incredible.
pretzel with peanut butter inside.
this is American ingenuity.
I should cancel that conference.
not on my account.
it's not just your safety I'm concerned about, Eli.
I'm responsible for all the members of that committee.
you really screwed me here.
did you think I wanted the assassins to follow me?
I think you told them where to find you.
he is a splinter in my toe, Leon. He has been for years.
if I do not extract him now, it could become infected.
that's nasty, Eli.
yet illustrative.
a couple of the former directors are saying that this chaos is the result of bad blood between you and me.
they're saying that once we get to the subject of Amsterdam, it'll be about one of us trying to make the other one look bad.
but you and I know better.
I never wanted to revisit this in the first place.
leon, your first mission in Amsterdam was the beginning of your career.
we gave you a life, but you should want to know if it was not all just a lie.
they are all here, Leon.
I have delivered you each and every man and woman, everyone who knows everything.
now, you must be courageous and learn the truth.
el Masri will try and kill you before that happens, you know that.
no matter how many resources we put in his way.
let him come.
and our people are supposed to be better.
if he manages to get through and to kill me, I wouldn't want to go on, anyway.
I understand you volunteered for this detail.
Yes. To protect my director.
all right, let's go.
that is all you're going to say to me?
what is the point?
I know this face.
you made the same one when I told my brother he could not buy you a pony.
Ziva, if you want to talk, we will talk.
I'm not going to beg.
why not?
you know, confronted with the prospect of your own death, another man...
a lesser man... -- A human man!
would want to.
Ziva, you are not dead.
you are living your life, making your choices.
if you choose to let me be part of your life, I would welcome that with open arms.
I am saddled with responsibilities that you cannot possibly fathom.
the safety of the nation.
and every one of our neighbors wants us dead.
I don't have the luxury of allowing my feelings to dictate my actions.
you do not have any feelings.
I have no feelings?
there was a time, Ziva, when I was quite different.
when my house was filled with the sound of children laughing.
you and Ari and Tali.
there was a time, Ziva.
Yes.
his heart is hidden for a reason.
anybody got anything?
nothing yet, boss.
keep looking.
if El Masri set up any attack positions, we'll find them.
Malachi, you notice that laundry van that's been parked there forever?
uh, boss... we found El Masri's fixed remote gun position.
this is sloppy.
he had to know we'd make a perimeter sweep.
Yeah.
Ziva, divert your approach to the service entrance.
copy that, McGee.
diverting to secondary.
most fathers teach their daughters how to drive. I have you to blame for this?
this she learned from her mother.
is this the only alternative?
it is now.
get back!
move! Move!
stay down! Move back!
get him to the safe house!
Ziva! -- Now!
move!
get in! Get in! Let's go!
what the heck's going on out there?
sounds like World War III.
okay, everyone, just calm down.
we are calm. You're yelling.
there was a... threat.
it has been assessed, confronted, and dealt with.
in a fashion.
son, we've all been behind the curtain.
we-we know how it goes.
dead bad guy. The end.
okay, then.
I don't think a round of applause would be too out of line.
it's a joke.
agent Gibbs, everything secure?
Yeah. Hadar, report.
you okay? -- Fine.
Hadar, come in.
they should be back at the safehouse by now.
Hadar, acknowledge.
Leon? Are you there? Anyone?
Eli? -- What's happened?
you were there, too.
but Gibbs was speaking with an Israeli accent.
you sounded like Jimmy Palmer.
I'm not completely comfortable with the fact that you had a dream about me.
well, it's not like I can control it.
you're not making me feel any better.
get these down to archives ASAP.
they've been asking for them for three months.
okay. Agent McGee-- probationary agent to be.
good morning.
looks like Tony.
doesn't sound like him.
what are you up to, Tony?
just catching up on some old paperwork.
I think we're being set up for something.
then we should just ignore him.
old paperwork, huh?
boy, that sounds fun.
Hey, maybe you can do some of my expense reports for my Canadian trip, huh?
got in early. Had some time to kill.
also, there's a get-well card for Director Vance in there.
you can sign it when you get the chance. Huh?
last time you did an expense report for me, you reclassified my meals as livestock feed.
well, that was a little childish.
Yeah, I was audited.
well, I guess that makes us even.
great. Then I don't need to hear about it, whatever it is.
get moving. We got a missing petty officer.
there were no hits on the NCIC.
has he been missing 30 days?
we're not waiting 30 days.
petty Officer Jerry Neisler.
Gail Walsh, District Attorney out of Arlington.
it's only been a day, but the missing petty officer's a witness in a capital murder trial.
the only witness. - Any idea where he is?
right. That is what we're going to find out.
he's Navy, so I hoped NCIS might be able to help.
my department is stretched thin as it is, and... I'm almost out of time.
the trial starts in two days.
my entire case rests on Jerry's testimony.
without it, the killer will walk.
this is the last place I saw Jerry.
I dropped him off here six days ago and he was supposed to check in every day.
he does not live here?
no. He said he was going on a hunting trip with a friend who was about to deploy to Afghanistan;
that he was going to stay and water the plants.
did you check the petty officer's place?
with a fine-toothed comb.
after a credit card purchase for gas, he disappeared without a trace.
we spoke to the friend. He didn't even know Jerry was staying here.
the hunting trip appears to have been successful.
wherever the petty officer has gone to, it appears he left in a hurry.
this holiday turkey's not going to last very long.
did his testimony put him at risk?
if this was a Mafia trial, I'd say "yeah," but not this case.
you think different.
I think there's a lot of baseball bats lying around this place.
trust me, no one's going to care when the jury says guilty.
there is another bat in the guest bedroom.
boss... spoke to the neighbors.
if there was someone staying here, they didn't know about it.
I suggest we canvass the local takeouts.
it looks like the petty officer was eating in a lot.
good idea. -- It was actually Agent McGee's suggestion.
good idea.
agent Gibbs seems like a capable investigator.
there's none better.
and, um, Agent DiNozzo?
he's, um... also capable.
and, uh... single.
excuse me?
no, I just, I noticed that he wasn't wearing a ring.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
are you and he... ?
No! No! My relationship with him is strictly professional, and barely that.
then you... you wouldn't mind if I, uh...
we're in the middle of an investigation, and you, a trial.
I know, I just... like to keep my options open.
did you know that the majority of people meet their spouses at work?
not something I have high hopes for.
let's bag it.
really. There's a giant feathered turkey laying in the fridge, and that's all you're going to say?
what am I supposed to say?
well, I don't know. Maybe something like... "What do turkeys eat on Christmas"?
nothing-- because they're already stuffed.
you feeling all right?
Yeah. Are you? - Fine.
Po Neisler may have forgotten his Christmas turkey, but, uh, he took his shotgun.
Yeah, we're going to need to look at your case files.
of course. Of course, yeah.
um... Agent DiNozzo, did you want to accompany me back to my office?
the files are heavy and I need someone with strong arms.
so long, Mr. Professional.
you know, I think I'm just going to stay here. I'm sure...
agent McGee can help you.
baseball bats and a shotgun... That petty officer was worried about something.
petty Officer Jerry Neisler.
born and raised in Charlottesville.
he served two tours in Iraq before being reassigned to the States.
his, uh, record is, um, hmm, interesting.
define interesting.
despite good reports from his COs, he was repeatedly transferred.
administration communications.
he doesn't play well with others.
uh, actually, no, it's nothing like that.
Jerry's parents were both psychologists, and he was an only child.
which means what, exactly?
well, you kind of have to meet him to understand.
working on it.
along those lines, I took the liberty of making a list of possible reasons Jerry Neisler lost contact.
number one:
witnesses with a personal relation to the accused are sometimes reluctant to testify.
Yes. Yes, kind of like... ...you know.
kind of like Robert De Niro in Sleepers.
Yes.
the movie, Tony.
number two:
someone is threatening the witness.
well, why wouldn't Jerry call me if he were threatened?
maybe he can't.
okay. This is everything that we have on the murder trial.
the killer's name is Samuel Hayes, but he doesn't exactly have a lot of friends that would go to bat for him.
his wife is dead, and his daughter's a ward of the state.
okay, this is getting really irritating.
he's making us look bad.
McGee, do you have something?
uh, well, I was just... I was saying how it's also possible that the, um... uh, disappearance has nothing to do with the trial at all.
or... does.
uh, how do you want to divide things up?
my investigators can handle the BOLOs and check the hospitals.
we'll trace the petty officer's prior movements, starting with his hunting trip.
okay.
etymology, archaeology...
sociology, fluviomorphology...-- Fl-fluvio... Fl-fluvio...
...Morphology. It's the study of the formation of river channels.
fascinating. I think.
Yes. It's almost as fascinating as hymenopterology
um, uh, hy-hym...uh, the, that is the study of...
insects, Mr. Palmer. And specifically those with four diaphanous wings.
okay. Well, we may have to prune this list down just a little bit, Doctor.
I think that Facebook has a limit to the number of interests.
Facebook?
Yes, Jethro, Facebook.
uh, that's that thing that... some people do things with.
the term is "social networking."
uh, if I'm to maintain my proficiency when I'm doing psychological autopsies,
I have to keep up with the latest cultural developments.
as long as you keep current on this case, Duck.
fear not.
I may be new to social networking, but the Mallards invented multitasking.
Mr. Palmer!
Yes.
given your interest in the petty officer's hunting trip, and the lack of a human victim,
I took the liberty of, uh... Oh, trust me, Jethro.
you'll be glad I did.
cause of death was a shotgun blast to the breastbone. As expected.
what is not expected, however, are these yellow- and-tan tail feathers.
that it?
well, the subspecies of turkey on the East coast all have brown tail feathers.
duck, help me out here, will you?
well, this is a Rio Grande turkey, Jethro.
and they are found almo... Ooh, add ornithology to the list.
they are found almost exclusively in Kansas, Oklahoma or Texas.
so, where did Petty Officer Neisler get this one?
he could've taken a cross-country hunting trip.
his CO ordered him not to leave the state before the trial.
then if you want to find out where the petty officer has been,
I suggest that you determine from whence this turkey came.
five, six, seven, eight...
Hi, Gibbs.
I betch you don't know what this is called.
turkey trot.
I'm impressed.
you want to join? -- Not really.
well, can I finish?
all right.
I can see that you're here to talk turkey. Get it?
sorry, I'm just, I'm excited, Gibbs.
because I think that I already figured out what I figured out you came down here to ask me.
Where'd this come from?
I ran the turkey's DNA through the NWTFDNAD.
it's the National Wild Turkey Federation DNA Database.
they really need a new acronym.
turkey DNA database?
I know. It's a wonderful time to be alive, Gibbs.
and with it, I can tell you why there was a Rio Grande turkey in Petty Officer Neisler's refrigerator.
Why?
well, it turns out, if a state has a turkey overpopulation problem, they'll catch and release to other states that need a boost.
they keep records? -- Good ones.
so there was a pre-Christmas release two weeks ago, out of Virginia.
all the DNA is stored.
so, if a bird is in the system, we can pinpoint exactly which hunting ground it was released to.
which I did.
and here it is. Look familiar?
the last hit on our missing guy's credit card is ten miles from here.
Yeah, so I figure maybe he's hiding out in a familiar woods.
which is what I would do if I were him... without the hunting part.
which means that I wouldn't be him. I would still be me then.
if I never see another dead turkey again, it will be too soon.
well, you're probably gonna see one Christmas day.
ha! Not this year. I'm going skiing.
Really? With who?
with, uh, my friend from Miami.
he lived in the French Alps for a while. And he says he misses the snow.
excuse me. NCIS. You seen this guy?
Nope. -- No.
how about you? No.
we have been to three parks already.
the lead was thin enough to begin with.
perhaps Abby's sending us on a wild...
Oh, never mind.
he's here.
how do you know?
that's the guy! Don't move!
easy. Found him! -- Don't shoot. I won't testify.
I promise.
NCIS. Nobody's gonna kill you.
thank God.
we got it from here.
when I saw you flashing my photo.
she's got the eyes of a killer.
and you with that suit on?
figured I was dead.
somebody threatening you? Is that why you're running?
I got these badly worded e-mails warning me not to testify.
said if I told anyone, they'd kill me.
so I decided to lay low until the trial.
stayed at a buddy's.
but they found me.
the second warning said they weren't hugged enough as a child.
then I got this.
it is District Attorney Walsh.
no. Don't answer that.
why not? She's the only one who knew where I was staying.
I didn't tell anyone else. She has to be in on it.
the DA?
Yeah.
Yeah, this is Gibbs. --This is Walsh. Any luck finding Jerry?
nothing. -- No.
we still haven't found him yet.
the original is down with Abby.
so is Jerry.
they're working on I.Ding the guy who made it.
the old knife to the neck.
reminds me of... -- Reminds you of what?
reminds you of an old fraternity prank?
a Halloween movie?
I know what you're doing.
and I know what you're doing.
what am I doing? -- I don't know.
but it's bugging me to such a degree... -- I know what we're not doing.
did a complete background check on the DA.
nothing jumps out.
well, she may not be the source of the leak, but she could've told someone where Jerry was staying.
she did not tell her assistant.
per your request, I made inquiries. Discreet inquiries.
it appears the DA was the only person who knew Jerry's location.
shall I arrange a safe house? -- He stays with us.
I wasn't able to trace the e-mails that Jerry was sent, but the intent was very clear.
to stop him from testifying. Which means our killer walks.
no, I think the answer is in the trial somewhere.
I suggest we divide up the case files by...
the trial centers around accused killer Samuel Hayes, 41.
worked as a private investigator for years, digging up dirt on bigwigs for bigwigs.
however, despite his somewhat grimy job, he was a family man.
had a reputation as a stand-up guy.
then his world fell apart: His wife was killed in a car accident; he started drinking.
his daughter ended up a ward of the state.
he ended up in the street.
that's right, boss.
Hayes made a living working as muscle for whoever would hire him.
then, one night, he mugged a brother and sister in an alley.
shot and killed the sister.
and our petty officer saw the whole thing.
DiNozzo, find out who the killer worked for.
Ziva. -- I will stay on the DA.
McGee, I want to talk to the brother.
got it.
Katie had just taken me out for my birthday.
Benihana.
it was a family tradition.
used to be a Polaroid.
it's not really the same now.
but nothing was the same after our parents died.
your sister got custody of you?
that was my big sister.
always looking out for me.
even on the night she was killed.
we took a shortcut home.
and this... this guy pulled a gun on us.
Katie didn't even hesitate. She jumped right in front.
I don't remember what happened next.
just the blood.
you weren't able to identify the killer.
I couldn't be sure.
made the mistake of telling the police that.
not a mistake. You just want the right guy to pay for this.
but we know who the right guy is!
there's a witness!
or there was.
the DA told me he's missing.
she say anything else?
that you're looking for him. But you need to look harder.
that witness saw everything.
you know, my-my parents raised us to forgive and forget.
but all I want right now...
payback. -- Justice.
you have to find that witness, Agent Gibbs.
you have very symmetric zygomatic arches.
as long as they help you catch whoever's after me.
well, taking precise measurements of your face,
I can extrapolate the exact dimensions of the knife-holding hand.
it'll be useful when we get a suspect.
smart. I can see why Agent McGee was interested in you.
excuse me?
when he brought me down here he didn't seem too comfortable leaving me alone.
I love this song.
I've had, um, problems with visitors.
so, he was just being overprotective.
of what? Your butt?
he couldn't stop checking it out when your back was turned.
Really?
but I can see why you probably wanted to keep things casual.
and why is that?
what if he was the one? You're obviously married to your work.
it's too soon to meet the one.
are we done? -- Yes, very.
Gibbs, can you make him go away, please?
go with him. Take a look at some photos. -- Sure.
Hey, I'm Jerry. -- Forensics from the murder trial.
you take a look yet? --Oh, yeah.
all they got is a positive GSR test on the alleged killer's shirt.
it means he fired a weapon.
not who he fired at.
Yeah. The case is gonna hinge on Jerry's testimony.
I'm sure he has a lot to say.
I know someone else who might.
I got that list of people the killer was working for.
drug dealers, loan sharks.
they gotta be hoping he beats the murder rap.
Hayes gets convicted, he could cop a plea.
rat any of them out.
gives them all motive to try and shut Jerry up.
this guy's interesting.
Smitty Brown. Dealing in black-market weapons, drugs.
been making a lot of visits to Hayes in the joint.
pick him up.
can't find him. He disappeared the day Jerry received the DVD.
I want to talk to Hayes.
already made arrangements.
good job.
again. --Thanks, boss.
you feeling okay, DiNozzo?
never felt better.
um, I would stay away from that Jerry, if I were you.
holler when you're done, sir.
what did I do now?
close six!
you know this guy?
Yeah, I know him.
I helped with collections when customers were behind in their payments.
you know where he is?
now how would I know that?
he's your number-one visitor.
actually, he's your only visitor.
sorry, can't help you.
What'd you guys talk about?
keynesian economics, Paleolithic migrations.
you know, guy stuff.
don't remember.
before. After.
you remember this?
your old boss tell you that if you kept your mouth shut, he'd take care of your witness for you?
I don't have to answer you.
where is he?
What're you gonna do, hmm?
the D.A.'s already asking for the death penalty.
yeah? It's an airtight case.
officer. -- Open six!
should I take my shoes off?
I wish your wouldn't.
never stayed at a safe house before.
what's for dinner?
beans.
so you met with the killer.
think he was after me?
I think he knew something.
I saw him at a hearing.
seems like a sad, sorry guy.
kind of reminds me of you.
both live alone, no family.
just saying. Look at her.
you can tell she's got good taste.
never let you get away with this lumpy couch if she was still here.
but seems like you're trying to make some changes.
some kind of home makeover.
finally cleaning up these magazines.
all right.
there's a cot down in the basement, right through there.
can I use the phone? I told my CO I'd let him know where I'm staying tonight.
you spoke to your CO?
I called him this afternoon.
felt bad about not giving him a heads up.
get down in the basement.
what's wrong? -- Get in the basement! Go! Go! Go!
all right. Okay.
where is he?
he's downstairs in the basement.
you have no right to withhold my witness from me. This is my case.
it's our case.
we need to talk. Sit down.
you've done enough talking.
who gave you permission to visit Hayes in prison today?
I don't need your permission.
you sure about that?
did you know that after you spoke to him there was an attempt on his life?
he'll live, but the trial has been postponed. Which just puts Jerry in more jeopardy.
you're not helping my case.
you're going to ruin it.
I demand that you hand over custody of Jerry.
he is my witness. -- That's not going to happen.
not until I find out who's trying to stop him from testifying.
Yeah, we want the same thing.
really now? Do we? -- What are you suggesting?
Jerry said you were the only one who knew where he was staying.
you think I'm trying to sabotage my own trial?
I didn't tell a soul where Jerry was.
whoever was threatening him must have been following him.
what else aren't you telling me?
withholding information just further jeopardizes this case.
we think we know who's after Jerry.
the accused murderer... --Has been visited several times in prison by this man.
who is he?
former employer Smitty Brown.
we think he's worried that your killer's going to rat him out if convicted.
cut him some kind of deal.
but if Jerry does not testify, no deals to cut.
and why haven't you picked him up?
can't find him.
well, I may be able to help with that.
my office has a number of active informants in the street.
fine. But Jerry's staying here.
only on the condition that you keep me apprised of any new information.
Hey, boss, I just got an e-mail from Abby.
says she has some new information.
should I go after the District Attorney?
no.
okay, dude. Here you go. 20 bucks.
20 bucks! Just to drink a gallon of eggnog?
without puking, though. All right?
deal.
chug, chug, chug... --Bet you can't wait to see how that ends.
badly.
but I think I'm going to be able to use this to track down the guy that made Jerry's DVD.
of course you can, Abbs.
well, I've been hitting a lot of brick walls.
there's no fingerprints, and this product is sold in, like, a thousand places.
but then I noticed something.
two dead pixels.
there and there.
the dead pixels have to be from the camera that was used to shoot the video.
so it's sort of like a fingerprint.
I started scanning other video upload sites like CyberVid and YouTube to try to find other videos that had the same missing pixels.
that's enough to make an I.D?
well, with all the possible combinations, the odds of a match being a coincidence is extremely remote.
you got a match.
actually, I got four.
and all I needed to do to narrow them down was to measure the hands in the video, and then to compare them to the hand in Jerry's video.
if I get a match, we got our guy.
and I got a match.
this video was uploaded four years ago.
the profile belongs to a guy named Joe Casey.
he is our cameraman. -- Send it up to McGee.
we're gonna need a BOLO.
actually, no, you're not.
Joe Casey has been a guest in the county morgue since this morning.
23 years old.
already had a record for B&E, larceny, grand theft auto.
had a rep as a gun for hire.
we're thinking that Smitty Brown hired him to scare the witness.
then took him out when he was done.
our local M.E. disagrees.
when I picked Casey up, he told me that he believed that the cause of death was an animal mauling.
and you don't, Duck?
duck? -- Uh, I'm sorry.
uh, well, this liver doesn't seem so much mauled as inflated.
inflated? -- Yes.
literally to the point of exploding.
and look here.
a number of these organs...
well, they appear to have freezer burn, and yet the rest of the body shows no signs of...
duck. Why are you so distracted?
I apologize.
Dr. Mallard has received several e-mails from various, uh, lady friends since posting his online account.
well, some of them are quite provocative.
I'm having difficulty concentrating.
freezer burn?
Yes, freezer burns throughout the thoracic and abdominal regions.
I mean, I'm simply at a loss to explain it.
however, Mr. Palmer may be able to help you narrow the search parameters for this man's killer.
he made an astute discovery.
this tattoo right here, it's new.
the micropunctures had barely begun to heal when he was murdered.
I would say that this man was killed within minutes of this tattoo being completed.
so if you can find the parlor... -- Somebody may have seen something.
good work, Duck.
actually, I'm the one who-who did...
good work, Dr. Mallard.
the Dumpster where they found Joe Casey's body is behind this building, and that is the only tattoo parlor within a five mile radius.
you got Casey's photos?
Yeah.
Tony had them waiting for me on my desk.
and, um, he also had updated all of my BOLOs on Smitty Brown.
well... ...the joke's getting kind of old, isn't it?
I no longer think he's joking.
look, Tony is a great investigator, don't get me wrong, but the closest he likes coming to filling out paperwork is renewing his Maxim subscription.
I know. Which is why I'm growing so concerned.
you know what, actually I am, too.
he gave me half his French fries at lunch.
one of us has to confront him.
and tell him what?
why aren't you acting like a 14-year-old anymore?
I was going to say more like a 12-year-old, but yes.
is that Smitty?
I believe so.
who wants to know?
I'll make you a list.
don't I get a phone call or something?
I'm gonna want that back.
you want that back, too?
it's called a wasp knife, right?
used by hunters to take down big game.
injects compressed gas-- freezing and exploding internal organs.
found it in your car. -- It's a murder weapon.
I don't even know this guy.
why would I want to kill him?
tying up loose ends.
I don't have any loose ends.
on trial for murder. Going to get the chair.
you were afraid that if he gets convicted, he'll turn you in for a lighter sentence.
he had you on dealing, gun running.
then you hired this punk, Joe Casey, to intimidate the witness. Then you killed him.
you guys got this all wrong.
and when you couldn't stop the trial, you tried to have Hayes whacked in prison.
I didn't try and kill anybody.
Casey tried to kill me.
I heard somebody was messing with a witness in the Hayes trial, same as you.
so I put the word out on the street-- see if I could find out who it was.
you ask anybody.
that's where I met this Casey guy.
I don't know who he was working for, but it wasn't me.
I told him to back off the witness.
he made a move.
it was self-defense. End of story.
you told him to back off?
well, that's the part you're not getting.
I don't want Hayes out of prison. I need him in prison.
I needed a guy inside the joint to help me out in this little side business I had going
my last dealer got executed.
Hayes agreed to be my new guy.
What'd he get out of it?
just kept asking me to make deposits to some life insurance policy he had.
life insurance?
for a guy about to get the death penalty?
I don't know what his deal is, all right?
I just know what the deal was.
and I can prove it.
but you and Tony... -- Enough!
we're just friends. There's nothing different about him.
all right.
you recognize him? -- No.
but the rest of Smitty's story checks out.
he did have an inside guy in prison who was dealing for him recently executed.
I was also able to confirm that he was making Hayes' insurance policy payments.
in fact, Hayes recently placed a call to his broker to confirm the policy pays, even if he is executed.
who's the beneficiary?
well... Thank you.
his daughter.
still no leads on whoever tried to kill Hayes in prison, though.
because no one did.
I just got off the phone with the prison doctor.
he now believes Hayes' wounds were self-inflicted.
he disguised his suicide attempt.
but the guy thought he was going to walk.
why try and kill himself?
seems pretty obvious to me.
I'm sure you guys would've figured it out eventually.
Hayes doesn't want to beat the murder rap.
he's given up.
he just wants to die and leave one last gift to his daughter.
but... he thought I was missing.
which meant he'd go free, so he tried to kill himself.
another sad guy.
then, uh, who has been intimidating the witness?
somebody is trying to get this guy out of prison.
Hey, boss, I think I found something here.
take a look at the call log from Smitty's burn phone.
there are several calls from this number.
look familiar?
district Attorney Walsh.
same DA who said she didn't know who Smitty was?
this is ridiculous.
you have no right to treat me like a criminal.
and I have a date in two hours!
Thanks.
I was getting a headache.
Really?
this is usually your favorite part.
getting to watch reality TV at work, as you call it.
well, people change, Ziva.
Yes.
but... not that quickly.
and yet, here we have this... New Tony, who arrives early, stays late, turns down advances from beautiful women, and has not made a single joke in the past...
what?
two days. -- I haven't?
are you sure?
well, we are in the middle of a case.
has not stopped you before.
well, it's stopping me now! And I'm sorry if you're losing sleep over it, but I can't be responsible for everyone's feelings.
everyone.
for example... -- You. And McGee.
and the Brenda Bittners of the world-- everyone!
Yeah.
the girl who posted online that we were in a "committed relationship" last year.
Yes.
Yes, but if I remember correctly, the only thing you were committed to was a one-night stand.
that's right.
I just found out that she checked herself into a depression treatment facility or something, after she wrapped her car around a tree. Nice one, huh?
and do you feel responsible?
no. I mean, I barely knew the girl. I'm just saying.
well, clearly she was a troubled woman.
that's clear now, isn't it?
still, it must be, um... unsettling to think that you didn't notice at the time.
especially since your job is to help people who are in trouble.
I don't know why this has gotten under my skin like this.
I mean, of all things.
maybe instead of having a mid-life crisis, I'm having a mid-life crazy.
look, you are not crazy.
okay? You are just...
growing up.
and some lessons are more painful as we grow older, when the stakes are higher.
but... you need to find balance.
and yes, yes, yes, yes, you need to treat people more respectfully, especially when it comes to matters of the heart.
but you... need to be who you are.
who am I?
you are... Tony DiNozzo, the class clown.
that is why we love you.
I'm going to have your badge.
you lied to me.
you withheld crucial information. -- Look who's talking.
said you didn't know our prime suspect.
his cell phone sure knows you.
in the last month alone, there's half a dozen calls there from you.
and you knew about his prison visits.
okay. Look, I had a good reason.
what? To destroy your own case?
no, no! I withheld my relationship with Smitty to protect my case.
your relationship?!
look... Smitty was an informant for my office, and then things got a little... complicated.
what?
he's a good-looking guy.
if the killer's defense team found out that I was sleeping with the subject of the investigation, they could argue that the entire chain of evidence had been tainted.
my case would be over.
maybe.
maybe if you had said something earlier...
please, please, you do not have to tell the judge.
Yeah, actually, I do.
it's unbelievable, isn't it?
after all this, the killer could still walk.
we'll know as soon as the hearing's over.
listen... Tony... -- Not you, too.
Ziva talk to you already?
And?
and I think the hearing's over.
doesn't look good.
how bad?
the judge threw the case out.
the interim DA is looking at his options, but as of now...
Hayes walks.
Plus, we never even got to find out who was threatening Jerry.
how'd the victim's brother take it?
he wasn't there.
Really? Trial notes says he's been to every single hearing.
Yeah, I read that one, too.
move.
the alley.
you have anything to say to me?
they know what you did.
excuse me?
you hired the guy to try to stop my trial.
they know what you did.
we found the wire transfer you used to pay him.
you wanted to scare Jerry out of testifying.
we just don't know why.
why don't you put the gun down and explain it to us?
no. He has to pay for what he did.
he was about to.
the DA was asking for the death penalty.
do you know how long the average convicted killer spends on death row before being executed?
13 years.
assuming it happens at all.
that just wasn't going to cut it.
so you tried to get Hayes out onto the streets, where you could get payback.
where I'm going to get payback.
Matt... it's not worth throwing your life away.
and what about my sister's life?
she was the only family I had left.
and you took her.
I can't give you her life back.
okay?
but maybe I can give you yours.
well, Merry Christmas to me.
look, I'd supply the bullets myself, if I thought killing me would make you feel better, but it won't.
you don't know anything about me.
I've spent more time thinking about you than I have anything else in my entire life.
and I'm clean now, and I barely remember what I did, but I understand it now.
I took your sister's life.
I wasted mine.
are you really going to let me destroy yours as well?
put the gun down.
and what, he just goes free?
look, it's just a matter of time before the new DA refiles the charges and I'm back in court again.
and you know what?
I'll just save everyone the trouble and I'll plead guilty.
hell, I'll even sign the confession right now...and maybe we can just pretend that this never happened.
we may have to settle for pretending some of it never happened.
I can talk to the DA.
I miss her so much.
another dream about work, McGee?
please tell me I was not in it.
you weren't, but your knives were.
what do you think that means?
well, I do not want to speculate.
Palmer, what's wrong?
...because you really saved my life... -- Told Palmer not to talk to him.
why is Jerry still here?
he wanted to thank Gibbs personally.
so, uh... Gibbs tell the DA, yet, about Matthew Gray?
Yeah. He's willing to drop the witness intimidation charge if Gray pleads guilty to the weapons charge.
he won't do any time.
looks like you're going to have to have another talk with him.
you.
too much?
happy XMAX!!!
smart, dedicated, young people just like yourself.
the best our country has to offer.
here, take these home and read them over with your parents.
you got a big decision to make.
okay, thanks.
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there.
so... where is she?
who?
Tony, Ziva's been gone since Thursday.
Oh, this... Ziva.
gosh, I hadn't noticed.
you are lying.
magee, I have better things to do than to obsess over the whereabouts of our little Miss Fancypants Ziva.
yeah? Like what?
well, for instance, there's lunch.
today I'm thinking falafel.
Tony... --All right, - she spent the weekend with him. -- Him who?
the Sire of South Beach, the King of Key West, the man with the...Mr...
I'm running out of things to call him.
she won't even tell us his name.
morning.
gorgeous day.
it's 27 degrees out.
who are you?
my name is, uh, is Magnus.
I'm meeting with Dr. Mallard.
Oh, okay.
is Ducky in the pond yet, McGee?
I haven't seen him. You're welcome to wait here, though, if you'd like.
uh, if you don't mind, I... I'd like to-to wait in... in Autopsy.
you sure?
smells funny.
well, that's... that's a matter of opinion.
it's a matter of dead bodies.
stinky.
your escort will be happy to take you there, Mr. Magnus.
uh, Doctor, and... I - I think I know the way.
friend of yours, Tim?
he says he knows Ducky.
looks familiar.
come on! Grab your gear! Don't want to miss the school bus.
class trip, boss?
got a dead petty officer in a high school stairwell.
janitor found him this morning.
heck of a fall.
guess nobody heard him.
in high school, no one can hear you scream.
of course, it wasn't high school, was it?
it was space; Alien, 1979.
Ridley Scott and that Sigourney Weaver.
tall drink of water, but you... Shutting up, boss.
nose is broken, jaw looks shattered, too.
got an I.D?
petty Officer First Class Simon Craig, 27.
did two tours overseas, then requested a transfer back to the States.
been working out of the Naval Recruiting Station in Alexandria ever since.
musty stench of high school stairwells.
copped my first feel in a stairwell very much like this.
Hey, DiNozzo.
anyway, I.D. and cards are gone. No cash.
robbery. -- Gone bad, maybe.
navy ring's still on his finger.
his watch, too.
check with the school for kids with discipline problems.
find out who he reported to.
Ducky will give us a time of death.
where is Ducky?
Dr. Mallard is... is right behind me.
at least he was.
why do people always get killed in the least accessible places?
I once found a ship's cook all chopped up an-and left in a... in a deep fryer.
the sailors nibbled on him and the... and the calamari for days.
could someone please help me down the steps?
my... my knees aren't what they used to be.
magnus, right? -- Right. And you're, uh...
you're Gibbs.
I- I-I remember you.
Yeah, I remember you, too.
doc, you can take a look, but you can't stay here.
it's a crime scene.
Oh, sure I can.
no, you can't.
well, I'm, I'm not gonna bother you.
I'm not gonna touch the... the merchandise.
I'm just here as a... as an observer today.
I hope so. You're retired, Doc.
I'm sorry. Retired from what?
Tony, meet former medical examiner and my esteemed predecessor Dr. Walter Magnus.
Ma-Magnus is my guest.
bringing guests to crime scenes now are you, Duck?
only ones that used to be me.
Oh, the clock's ticking, Gibbs.
you-you really should get this man into autopsy...be-before we all die of... of old age.
very nice to see you again, Doc.
recognize that light box?
I think it might be older than you are.
nothing's older than I am.
you know, Walter, when you called to say that you were coming to visit at such short notice,
I was a bit surprised.
well, there's no-no time like the present.
retirement does have some advantages.
it's not how you felt when you left.
I- I knew I'd left the department in-in good hands.
You-you've done a fantastic job, Donald.
thank you, Doctor.
rest assured it hasn't been without its challenges.
tell me, are you still living with your lovely wife in South Carolina?
sweet Elizabeth passed... almost a decade now.
I'm sorry.
no, no, no, don't be.
we had 47 years of happiness.
a man... a man can't ask for more than that.
and your daughter?
since her mother died, we, um... Jenny and I, we-we don't talk much.
she has her own family now.
people grow apart.
life goes on.
well, you'll always be welcome here.
it's, it's good being back, Donald.
petty Officer First Class Simon Craig.
he's a local kid out of Chesapeake City, Maryland.
he single?
never married.
his parents died in a car accident when he was a kid.
he was raised by his older sister Nina.
Nina runs the family crabbing business.
Mmm, crabs!
get a loaf of bread and a pitcher of beer.
glad to see you haven't lost your appetite, DiNozzo.
sister's on her way now.
recruiting station?
I spoke to his boss, Chief Petty Officer Jerome Carr.
the Alexandria office is anxious to cooperate.
check for rejected applicants.
rejects R us, boss.
Gibbs... I need a moment.
how are you holding up, Leon?
how do you think?
I'm on a strict diet of paperwork and painkillers.
I'm glad to have you back.
I'm glad to be back, considering the alternative.
where are we on that recruiter case?
we're just getting started.
it's a hell of a lot of catching up to do, Gibbs.
did you sign anything, did you read anything in my absence?
no.
it comes with the job.
better you than me.
no doubt I'm appreciative, but since I got hurt, we've been on SECNAV's radar, and I want to prove that recent events haven't influenced things around here.
it's gonna take you a while to get on track, Leon.
you're lucky to be alive.
you don't think I know that?
no, I do think you know it.
I think you also feel responsible.
things needed to be dealt with.
all right, then, suck it up, move on.
get back to work, Agent Gibbs.
you, too, Director... Vance.
I informed the district office in Richmond of Petty Officer Craig's death.
this is a tremendous loss to the Navy.
he was a good man.
how's the recruiting business been, Carr?
we're up about five percent from last year.
not everybody makes Uncle Sam's cut, huh?
absolutely not.
there are written and physical evaluations, a full criminal background check and then the interviews.
so, if everything's looking up, who would want to kill Petty Officer Craig?
one guy really held a grudge against Craig.
kept calling, leaving threatening messages.
even contacted our commanding officer at District.
the train wreck have a name?
our recruiter job is to find career sailors.
zanetti had issues.
that's an understatement.
work address is on the form.
knock yourselves out.
it's amazing that you guys didn't have all these computers and stuff, and you solved cases, like really complicated cases.
I mean, I know that coroners were doing forensic autopsies back then, but it wasn't until 1975 that the FBI installed their first automated fingerprint reader.
that sort of revolutionized what I do, or what, what we do.
I- I-I haven't understood one... one thing you said, but I'm, I'm all for it.
uh, forensics have certainly changed, haven't they, Doctor?
Yes, indeed.
you should see her when she gets excited about a case.
come meet Dr. Magnus.
he's like a forensic history book, and he's adorable.
I mean that with the utmost professional respect.
Yeah. We've met.
what do you got, Abbs?
well, I digitally lifted a boot print from Petty Officer Craig's facial features.
after he was hit at the top of the steps, he landed at the bottom of the stairs with multiple contusions, a concussion, broken bones, but this was the death blow.
it was a single downward blow.
that crushed the front of his skull.
leading to a severe temporal hemorrhage.
you have details on the boot print, Abbs?
it is a Global Trailbreaker work boot.
Un-Unbelievable.
what I would've given for a, a,a piece of, of hardware like her.
I mean, like, like, like this.
well, you were part of a different era, Walter.
an era that had to work harder for results.
Ah, hell, Doc, nothing to be ashamed of.
there was also a wood tack embedded in the boot's rubber heel, and Ducky found particles of sawdust in the grooves.
killer's a woodworker.
thank you, Abbs.
he... He, he just kissed her.
well, consider it an innocent gesture of endearment.
cover your mouth.
I'm allergic to sawdust.
mostly pine.
better with hardwoods, you know, walnut, oak.
were you a sickly child?
cause I'm betting you were a sickly child.
I need my inhaler.
I want Ziva back.
all right, let's just get this over with. Where's Zanetti?
what do you think about the dude at the chop saw?
forearms like Popeye?
tattoos?
let's approach him carefully.
James Zanetti... turn off the chop saw.
zanetti, federal agents!
hands in the air, now!
did you break Zanetti?
I offered to drop the lumber assault charge if he confessed to Craig's murder.
Yeah, he almost put your head in a Cuisinart, though.
Yeah, well, Zanetti admits to sending hate mail to the recruitment office, but swears up and down he didn't kill anybody.
and you believe him.
took an extension class last night.
couldn't have done it.
how to Pick Up Girls.
that guy? -- So now what?
I'm going to be checking disciplinary records, and the guidance counselor gave us a list of five kids Craig was advising.
I thought you were in Miami.
you look... positively Alpine.
he came to me.
we went skiing again, this time to Vermont.
Vermont. That's... so quaint.
they have all those lovely little country inns, and, uh, cozy fires, and sticky maple syrup that gets everywhere.
he enjoys nature, and I discovered that he's a fantastic cook.
he made this- oof, delicious- osso bucco.
aren't you lucky. So he's a real Renaissance man, huh?
he is an experienced man, who knows how to appreciate life.
there is a difference.
so when do we get to meet him? And please tell us his name.
Oh, no! Please. Let me guess.
Zeus? Uh... Thor.
his name is Ray.
ray? What a nice little name.
ray, like Ray Kroc or Ray Charles or Sugar Ray?
um... I promise you, Ray is a good man.
my brother loved the Navy, Agent Gibbs.
and he loved helping people even more.
that's what made him such a good recruiter.
a man has to enjoy his work to do it well.
personal life?
nothing out of the ordinary.
women.
guess it won't do any harm now.
what?
telling the truth.
agent Gibbs, my brother was gay.
we didn't talk about it much.
couldn't.
was he involved with anyone?
high school teacher.
english, I think.
teacher have a name?
glenn Block, tenth-grade English?
you're looking at him. -- NCIS.
special Agents DiNozzo and David.
we would like to speak with you for a moment.
of course.
it's about the murder of Petty Officer Simon Craig.
we understand you knew him?
we were friends.
according to some, you were a little more than friends.
we'd been seeing each other for about a month.
it was comfortable, you know?
unfortunately, I'm also in a committed relationship.
did your other partner know about Petty Officer Craig?
it's not a man.
it's my wife.
Oh, boy.
penny threw me out.
I've been staying in a motel.
so... is she angry enough to kill?
don't be ridiculous.
she didn't kill Simon.
how can you be so sure?
I've been married to her for 11 years.
I know.
we will need to talk to her.
please.
do you understand what something like this could do to our lives?
to my career?
don't envy that guy.
at least he's being honest with himself.
with who he really is.
no one said life is easy.
all that skiing made your blood run cold.
I'm not being cold-hearted. I'm being realistic.
at least the wife knows the truth.
dad, don't stress. I'll handle it.
no, you won't handle it, Paul.
Hey, check it out.
I think that might be one of the kids Craig was talking to.
it won't take away from anything else.
you've made those promises to me in the past.
Yeah, well, I'll keep this one.
NCIS. Could we talk to you for a second?
actually, we're a little late for a meeting with his guidance counselor.
we'll be quick.
do you recognize this man?
Yeah, that's the Navy guy I've been talking to.
what Navy guy?
when did you see him last?
last week, maybe.
Why?
he's dead.
Simon was a cool guy.
anything you can tell us would be helpful.
there's nothing to say, really; we just talked.
about...?
school.
college stuff, mostly.
listen, we really do need to be getting inside now.
if you can think of anything else, anything, uh, unusual, give me a call.
have a nice day.
boots?
I see.
is this, uh, is this Willy Wong's, uh, Wok?
Willy... Willy's been closed for, for 13 years.
who, who is this?
Ber-Bernie's... Bernie's Burritos.
Oh... Well, thank you very much, Bernie, but I, uh, I was kind of in the mood for... for Chinese food.
I told you, things have changed around here.
I guess, I guess so.
you wanted to see me, Duck?
Yes, Jethro.
take a look at these bruises.
many of them go well below the surface and into deep muscle tissue.
guy fell down stairs, Duck.
bruised a lot of things.
those, those are older... injuries.
even with these eyes, I could, I could see that.
contusions sustained days before his death.
Craig was in a fight?
a beating is more like it.
Dr. Magnus is correct.
and there are other signs of past injuries.
Yeah, poorly healed bone fractures.
this was not Petty Officer Craig's first physical encounter.
look, I know, I know it's a bit unorthodox, but in Mr. Palmer's absence,
I was wondering if Dr. Magnus could, uh, continue to offer his expertise if you've no objections.
no, it's fine with me.
Walter, why don't you put on some scrubs, and we'll, uh...
Oh, uh, oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
I was just... You know, it's been a while since I observed a... an autopsy.
um... Think I could use a, a little... a little air.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
glenn Block's wife was just arrested on a DUl charge.
there was also a pair of Global Trailbreaker work boots in the trunk of her car.
bring her in.
you know him?
seen him before.
he's dead.
won't catch me crying over him.
petty Officer Craig fought for his country.
and I'm fighting for my marriage.
and nobody is giving me a medal.
when did you learn about your husband's affair?
I had a feeling something was up, so I followed him.
found his car, parked at a motel off the interstate.
wasn't what I was expecting.
your husband ever do anything like this before?
you think I'd be here if he had?
eight days ago, you made a large withdrawal from your bank.
we think that you hired someone to assault Craig.
teach him a lesson.
anything you would like to say about it?
I hope it hurt.
so you admit it.
I'm not admitting anything.
maybe I should call a lawyer.
for the DUl, the assault or the murder?
where were you, night before last?
at a bar.
looking for a real man.
you got a lot of hate in you, Penny.
Yeah.
I hated Craig... for stealing my husband.
I hated the embarrassment.
I hated the humiliation.
but you didn't kill him.
what do you think?
somebody.
talk to me.
the night Craig was murdered, Penny Block was in Alexandria at a bar called, appropriately enough, The Alibi Room.
was anyone unlucky enough to pick her up?
well, according to the bartender, most of the evening was spent in a booth with a truck driver named Ernhart.
could've hired somebody to do this, too.
what about the five kids Craig was recruiting? Anything?
two were with family, two were playing varsity basketball in Reston.
the only one that had any contact with the petty officer that night was...
the boy we spoke to.
paul lost his mom a few years ago to cancer.
he's an only child.
his father Lance was recently laid off from a local factory job.
no substantial run-ins with the law, but his, uh, school file indicates multiple suspensions.
details?
the school has a history of racial problems, all sorts of social tension, but none of it links Paul specifically to any of it.
petty Officer Craig had no idea what he was walking into.
boss, uh, Director Vance wants to see you.
have any of you seen Dr. Magnus?
I've been looking for him everywhere.
Nope.
uh, sorry, Duck, not here.
you try the break room?
well, it's odd - he left Autopsy a while ago and seems to have just disappeared.
maybe he went home.
uh, possible but unlikely.
well, I'm sure he's fine - perhaps he went for a walk.
Yeah.
I'll check the lobby.
come in.
you want to see me?
recruiter case.
now, you could've called it anything else - why a potential hate crime?
a zebra has stripes, Leon.
politically, this is not the kind of attention I was looking for right now.
what do you want me to do, sweep it under the rug?
I've never turned a blind eye to a victim; I'm not about to start now.
do you have a basis for your evaluation?
violence wasn't new to Petty Officer Craig only this time he couldn't fight back.
Gibbs, even with the change in military regulation, you're about to tick off a lot of very important people.
maybe.
it's a hell of a can of worms.
well, someone's got to open it.
and it might as well be you.
I'm tired.
are you okay?
I don't know.
you need more time, Leon.
you should take it.
no.
can't do that, Gibbs - that's... that's pretty clear to me now.
and that's your decision.
Yes, it is.
Abby, I got your message.
I came as quick as I could.
now, did you have a forensic epiphany on the recruiter case?
no, not exactly.
well, what is it?
it's Dr. Magnus - I found him.
Oh, thank goodness!
I was beginning to worry about the old man.
you know, for someone who... -- Ducky, please.
your friend needs you.
Wh-where is he?
he's back here.
how long as he been like this?
well, I don't know - I was out of my lab for a while, and then I came back in and turned the lights on and... there he was.
I asked him if there was anything I could do to help him, and he just kind of looked at me and smiled.
it-it's me, Donald.
Yeah.
that's a hippo.
Yes, it is.
fascinating creatures.
their sweat... is the color of red.
it's true.
disturbing.
but-but beautiful.
Walter... what's going on?
I love it here at the zoo.
so much to see.
like-like the hippos.
it's a beautiful place.
help me get him up.
go and get him some water, please.
where am I?
it's open.
Mr. Simmons?
agents DiNozzo and David, NCIS.
Yeah, I remember you.
if I'd known you were coming, I... would have cleaned up.
so... looks like you're doing a little, uh, renovation.
Yeah, I'm doing it myself, in case we have to... sell.
what can I do for you?
uh, we actually wanted to ask Paul more questions.
is he around?
Nah, that kid comes and goes.
17 you know how it is.
so he's, uh... pretty interested in going in the Navy, huh?
you kidding?
no, not my Paul.
why is that?
cause he's never been able to take orders.
you know, he marches to his own drum.
so you had no knowledge that he was talking to Petty Officer Craig?
no, I didn't.
I hope he didn't waste that guy's time.
how would that be a waste?
because he's my kid.
because I know what he's capable of, and...
you know, if he joined the Navy right now, that wouldn't be good for you or him.
Hey, Paul.
remember these agents from this morning?
Yeah. Sure.
they just want to ask you some more questions about that recruiter who died.
I already told you everything that I know.
it'll just take a second.
Hey, Paul! Wait!
stay here!
stop!
don't move!
Paul, get out of the car.
turn the engine off!
now!
so, why'd you run, Paul?
I don't know.
agents just wanted to talk.
you hiding something?
I got scared.
scared of what?
everything.
you remember Petty Officer Craig?
good guy.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, he just wanted to talk, too.
I'm beginning to think you just don't like to talk, Paul.
I didn't do that.
I didn't hurt anybody.
agent Gibbs... my son is not a killer.
may 2010, you got in a fight after school; suspended.
september, same year, another fight; suspended again.
you got a temper, Paul.
those weren't my fault.
you don't understand.
witnesses put you at the college fair the other day.
they saw you with Petty Officer Craig.
I stayed for a few minutes.
we talked; I left.
yeah? Where'd you go then?
home.
prove it.
I can't.
wait, all right, that's enough.
I think you met with Petty Officer Craig afterward.
no.
you were talking to him in the stairwell, weren't you, Paul?
No! -- That's it!
this-this is over.
let him answer.
we need to speak privately, Agent Gibbs.
now.
you can't do that!
Yeah, I can, as long as you're present.
look, Paul might be hotheaded, he might be stubborn
he did not kill that sailor.
your son has a history of acting out.
well, what kid doesn't?
he admits he saw Craig before he was murdered.
you heard him.
he was home.
where were you?
where were you, Mr. Simmons?
were you out at a bar?
were you out picking up a 12-pack?
I was passed out in my car, drunk.
look... ever since his mother died, Paul's had it rough.
she understood him.
you know, he just needs a little... a little guidance.
you lose a parent that young, like he did, he's messed up.
that's all.
he's still got a father.
act like one.
here we are.
the healing powers of a single cup of tea are the equivalent of several hours rest.
so they say.
there are many things my Scottish ancestors got wrong, but taking the time to savor a nice cup of Darjeeling was not one of them.
Walter... I called your daughter Jenny in South Carolina.
you are not estranged from them.
in fact, you live with her now, and the two boys.
she's been terribly worried about you.
Yeah, Jenny, uh, Jenny's a sweet kid.
she's like her mother.
then why did you run away?
why come here?
this, uh, this job...this-this place...was...
well, it was... it was everything... t - to me.
well, I understand that.
Walter, you know.
but now you have grandchildren, and you have so much to share with them.
but, uh... I mean, then... my... my-my life had...
it had purpose!
your family is your purpose now, Walter.
you have a responsibility to those two boys to teach them everything you can.
but damn it, I can't!
I mean, don't... don't you see?
before the-the symptoms started, before the ...hell, Alzheimer's diagnosis... ...I would run cases in my head.
EV... Every autopsy, ev-every detail, I remembered it all.
and now... there's nothing!
that's why I came here, just one last time, thinking that... that-that maybe it would... it would...
it would all come back.
Donald... sometimes I can't remember... ...who I was.
then let me show you.
all right, who's got something?
paul got home before Petty Officer Craig was killed.
prove it.
one large deep-dish with extra pepperoni and sausage.
he ordered a pizza?
delivery kid remembers him; the receipt has a time stamp to prove it.
paul Simmons enlistment contract, did it say anything out of the ordinary?
aside from some less-than-stellar grades, all the information is truthful and accurate.
according to Petty Officer Craig's records, the other kids had phone conversations with him on a regular basis.
questions about deployment, life on board a ship.
paul never called.
McGee, access the petty officer's e-mail account.
navy or personal, boss?
personal.
already got the warrant.
I'm scanning, but nothing addressed specifically to Paul Simmons.
put it up.
do a word search.
don't ask, don't tell.
pay dirt, boss.
open them.
they're all coded.
no names listed.
everything on the QT.
the boy spilled his heart out to him.
all the fights at school were just Paul defending himself.
Craig was offering the kid advice.
paul didn't want to lie anymore.
petty Officer Craig... wanted to help.
petty Officer Craig understood.
thought he could offer me a new life.
he knew what I was feeling, what I was going through.
the fights?
since junior high school.
I tried to talk to teachers, counselors.
nobody wanted to li... listen.
what about your dad?
think about it.
your gay son comes to you, tells you he wants to join the military.
what would you say?
I'd wish him luck... try to be there for him.
my dad couldn't wrap his head around it.
thought it was crazy.
rather than talk me out of it, he tried to make it all just go away.
all I wanted was to protect my son.
you think I don't know what was happening?
guy meets my son at all hours, sending him private e-mails.
what if it wasn't "just business"?
no, Dad.
no.
that's not true.
he was helping me.
Oh... Paul, I just tried to be a good dad.
that's all I was trying to do.
agent McGee, are you ready?
one last entry, and we're good to go, Duck.
I told you I would help you remember all that you accomplished.
it's okay, Doctor, you don't... you don't have to do this.
these are your memories, Dr. Magnus.
look at them.
they're people you helped.
you gave them... answers.
you gave them closure.
and now... they can do the same for you.
director?
well, Paul, why don't we discuss your options.
the opportunities that I'm looking for.
I'm ready to serve my country, and I want to be a part of something special.
notification from Fleet Command.
change of assignment.
carry on.
we're heading for the East Sea to monitor the North Korean activity off the coast.
wake Commander Reynolds. Tell him to meet me on the bridge.
aye, aye, sir.
I'm trying to get this ship underway.
what the hell's so important the XO can't come to me?
Where's the commander? Is there a problem, Mr. Howard?
I just found him, sir.
as you know, Director, your team is long overdue for their mandatory psych evaluations.
I'm aware that they've been rescheduled.
nine times, to be specific.
and I spoke to your in-house psych service unit-- no time for them either.
if I didn't know any better, I'd say that you were avoiding us.
Oh, cases take priority.
some would say that's-- I don't know-- shortsighted.
well, the victims' families wouldn't.
agents need to be at the top of their game.
and my agents always are.
I've read the reports.
you were just hospitalized.
agent Gibbs resigned at one point.
agents DiNozzo and McGee were held captive.
they were rescuing Agent David.
did they receive posttraumatic treatment?
initial assessments were conducted, and they were all deemed fit for duty.
optimistic, but doubtful.
my colleagues and I have been hearing about your team for years.
SECNAV's concerned, so I'd like to get started today, - if that's convenient for you. - If it's not?
I promise that I won't be intrusive.
I prefer to be out in the field when I evaluate, so your team should not experience any down time.
it, uh, should be painless.
Oh, I'm not worried about them.
you, on the other hand...
skin's thicker than it looks.
so, who should I start with?
pardon?
in your opinion, who has the most to talk about?
where did you get that money?
ever heard of a trifecta?
I do not want to hear about your threesomes.
I went to the track.
Pimlico.
three ponies.
win, place and show.
what did they show you?
show. Means they came in third.
what made you pick these horses?
a keen mind, an eye for natural talent, a little bit of luck, and of course, they spoke to me.
who spoke to you?
the horses. The ponies.
I whisper to them, they whisper to me.
actually, no. You can study them before the race.
the ones that really want to win-- they do this little dance, little snorting.
Tony, you may want to stop acting like a jackass.
that's not an ass. It's a hor... hor...
I can explain, sir.
settle in, Doctor. This should be good.
doctor?
agents, this is Dr. Rachel Cranston.
she's here for your mandatory psych evaluations.
who's ready to talk?
no. Can't talk here.
we got a dead commander on the USS Colonial.
Dr. Cranston is here to observe your team, Agent Gibbs.
not much to see.
really.
I'll be the judge of that.
okay. Everybody, the doctor's in.
go!
this stateroom been compromised, Captain?
no, nothing's been touched.
who found the body?
ensign Howard.
I called the XO to the bridge.
Howard was sent to get him.
listen, Doc, about my, uh, Man O' War impression...
I thought it was Secretariat. -- Yeah.
I was just trying to lighten the mood.
you know, I entertain the coworkers.
why do you feel lightening the mood is your responsibility?
well, who else has the chops?
not to mention the talent.
uh, yeah, you're good, aren't you?
gently unscrewing the noggin, huh?
let me ask you something, very Special Agent DiNozzo.
was there ever a time when someone didn't approve of that behavior from you?
not gonna happen.
a lot of blood.
must've clipped an artery.
you find a weapon yet?
no. Start looking.
confounded ships are like laboratory mazes.
I always feel like a white rat in search of a tasty treat.
so, what do you think, Duck?
someone shot him.
Yeah, well, there's a start.
at close proximity.
through and through.
the slug should still be in his bunk.
uh, Agent McGee, help me turn him, so that Agent David can take a look.
there's no gun here.
the slug is still in the mattress.
I found a shell casing.
that's a Tokarev 25.
mostly used by Koreans and Russians.
captain, you got some visitors on board?
uh, seven, including a group of international journalists.
anyone know about the commander's murder yet?
uh, boss?
extra, extra, read all about it.
Yes, sir. I understand.
Yeah, I-I do.
I... We will, as soon as possible.
thank you.
that was SECNAV. Colonial's on lockdown.
you figure out who leaked the story?
no, not yet.
got two English reporters on board the ship; two French, one South Korean.
they were all with Navy personnel at the time of the shooting, except Min Ho Kwon.
bullet connects him.
he's a career journalist. He served four years in the Korean military.
okay. We're on it.
SECNAV is waiting for that team evaluation, Gibbs.
technically, until Dr. Cranston finishes that report, we're not cleared to operate in the field.
what do you want us to do, Leon, go home?
I want you to give the doctor your full support.
already am.
a bad report can lead to change, Gibbs.
record speaks for itself.
the record may not be enough.
we are who we are, Director Vance.
don't I know it.
somebody, talk to me.
commander Vincent Reynolds graduated Annapolis over 30 years ago.
served with distinction in the Sixth and Seventh Fleets for the past two decades.
just 18 months away from retirement when he died.
uh, single, never married, no children.
according to Captain Lynn, Reynolds was pals with Admiral Wayne Hargrove.
Hargrove's overseeing operations in the Far East, aboard the flagship USS Blue Ridge.
find out if Reynolds is doing any side work for the admiral.
and all of you, make some time for the doctor.
director Vance's orders.
what are we supposed to talk about?
well, believe it or not, most people talk about the sex lives.
that rules Tim out.
I will certainly remain professional.
well, since you're so confident what you'll be discussing, Agent David, why not start now?
all right, just have a seat.
Hey, I'm a journalist and a South Korean citizen.
I demand to be released.
you know how you can tell if a horse is nervous?
what?
they twitch, get a little weird look in their eye.
you got one of those right now.
well... you have no right to detain me.
actually, we do,'cause we're in the middle of a murder investigation, so why don't you sit down?
I'll get to you when I'm ready.
your instincts are spot-on.
he did it.
well, you cracked the case awful fast, Petty Officer... Oliver.
why do you think this guy killed your XO?
because I saw him and Commander Reynolds arguing last night.
the Korean wouldn't back down.
eventually, the XO walked away.
thank you.
now, why exactly are we doing this?
we are just talking, just getting to know each other.
okay, but I do not need to know you, and this is actually taking time away from my work.
sometimes, a little time away from work is a really good thing.
I do admire your dedication, though.
dedication is important to me.
hasn't that been something that you've been, uh, juggling your whole life?
I... I... I do not know what you mean.
juggling dedication to, uh, family, to country, to job, uh...
why was I not told the details of his mission?
why was I excluded?
because, Ziva, I don't know who you answer to anymore-- NCIS or Mossad.
what is it you expect from me?
I expect your loyalty... to me and only me.
only me!
I do not understand how this is relevant to what you need to know.
it tells me something about you.
about what brought you here.
about where you came from.
when you first came here, you, uh, replaced someone.
Yes.
special Agent Caitlin Todd.
she was killed in the line of duty.
had you ever met Agent Todd?
no, and I know that her loss was, uh, significant to NCIS.
anyone have a key for this?
it's Kate's desk.
okay, but if I'm going to be a part of your team, I would love to... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
you're part of our team?
Yes.
she's gone, Gibbs.
I don't think Kate will mind.
it's always very difficult filling someone else's shoes.
no disrespect, Doctor, but except from the fact that she was a woman... we are very different agents.
Oh, I can tell that individuality's very important to you.
are you... that discerning when it comes to men, as well?
keeping your personal and professional lives in balance is, is important.
and it looks like some men, over the years, have, uh...influenced your work.
my work has never been affected and this is none of your business.
actually, it is.
you thought I would not identify Michael Rifkin as a Mossad operative.
so you think you did the right thing?
okay.
are you, by any chance, questioning my loyalty?
I am questioning why you didn't tell them you saw him three days ago.
are you jealous?
he was playing you, Ziva.
you killed him! -- He attacked me!
what was I supposed
you put fire in his chest!
you... weren't... there.
but I should have been!
you loved him.
The-the-the thing that puzzles me with all this change of allegiance to country of the type of men you're drawn to, what is it that you're looking for?
what is it that you want?
I want... something... permanent.
something that can't be taken away.
is that too much to ask?
murder.
really.
I'll have to tell my wife Nancy.
Vincent was like family to us.
really.
even after you skyrocketed up the ranks?
I'm not sure I follow, Agent Gibbs.
Vincent Reynolds was just a commander, Admiral.
you're an admiral, Admiral.
Yeah, well, Vincent always knew that, uh, he had the gift of leadership much more than political savvy.
and, uh... he had a bad habit of telling people what he really thought.
and... if an aggressive journalist pushed the commander, would he have pushed back?
and then some, yeah.
well, then, how can I prove my innocence?
an alibi would be nice.
commander Reynolds was killed last night, at approximately 2: 00 a.m.
I was in my stateroom.
doing what?
my actions are not your concern!
on a U. S. naval vessel, they sure as hell are.
you're about to be accused of murdering an American officer!
do you understand what's at stake here?
heck of a powder keg.
what are you, the fuse?!
all right, I'll negotiate.
like hell you will. Not on my watch. See ya in prison.
I was sending e-mails!
e-mails?
I sent them through a series of encoded signals unencrypted by a sub off the coast.
well, then we'll need the name of the sub.
I cannot. They'll kill me.
I wouldn't be so worried.
south Korea's our ally.
north Korea isn't.
time stamps on the e-mails will prove my innocence.
I was sending photographs of your weapons systems.
arrest me for espionage.
at home, they'll call me a hero.
but I swear I'm not a murderer.
good morning. You're avoiding me.
doc, I gotta say I've never been a big fan.
of me, personally, or psychiatrists?
of course, my being a woman doesn't help either.
what's that supposed to mean?
I know you historically you have issues with professional women.
no, I like women.
I just just don't like 'em when they ask a lot of questions.
Hey, Gibbs.
I've confirmed that the casing was a Tokarev . 25-millimeter, fired from a Russian-made either TT-30 or a TT-33.
Oh, hello.
Shrinkola?
keep going, Abbs.
um, the markings on the rounds indicate that the weapon is older.
collector's item? -- Maybe.
Hey, what, what are you doing?
are you writing stuff about me?
just a question I want to remember to ask later.
do not let me interrupt.
well, it's too late for that, Sigmund.
I have been scouring the Web and local gun show listings for TT-30 sales or registered buyers-- so far, I have 28.
is, is that a lot?
of the 250, 000 registered firearms owners in the metro area, 28 is peanuts.
I'll get you the rest of the details when I have them. -- Thanks.
trust me, honey, you don't have enough hours in the day.
I'll find the time, Ms. Sciuto.
don't you worry.
I don't like head doctors.
no one does, Anthony.
they're like lie-detector tests.
they alert us to our fears and weaknesses.
I especially don't like this one. She's always judging me.
all right, well, obviously that's where the powder burns were.
the gun was held close.
Yeah, with a tremendous pressure.
note the bruising from the barrel on the commander's chest.
I also found a residue on his knuckles that I sent up to Abby and a severely broken nail on his right hand and hairline fractures on his index and middle fingers.
defensive wound?
possibly, yeah.
the question remains, why was the gunshot angle not higher?
I mean, the shooter was standing right over him.
sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Just came to say hello.
Hello.-- Good-bye.
you don't have to leave, Agent DiNozzo.
I do if you stay.
you seem to have sparked quite a reaction in him.
Yeah, occupational hazard.
I have that effect on people.
I warn you, Doctor, if your intent is to get inside my brain, you will be unsuccessful.
I know all the tricks too well.
Dr. Mallard, you are the least of my concerns... for now.
and what, pray tell, does that mean?
it means for the time being, you seem remarkably balanced.
I appreciate the compliment, Doctor.
nonetheless, dare I say the long hours and isolation occasionally take their toll.
you aren't alone, Doctor.
you got drawers full of people who keep you company.
and they are exceptional listeners.
nonetheless...
...there are times when I find myself, well... melancholy.
well, you aren't getting any younger.
I'm sure you recognize the irony of quietly facing the dead every day.
not only do I recognize the irony, I embrace it.
I appreciate your keeping me covered in front of the others, especially Tony.
Yes, I know how modest you are.
were.
I'm dead now, Ducky.
shouldn't be.
however...
I am not quite ready for assisted living.
now if you will excuse me, the commander is getting impatient.
okay, McGee, talk.
well, Abby just called.
she narrowed down the list of TT-30 and TT-33 buyers who registered guns.
one name popped up: Seaman Marcus Leonard.
requested mast against Commander Reynolds, three months ago, for inappropriate conduct.
Leonard's still in normal duty status, but he lives alone in his deceased parents' home in Shadyside, Virginia.
okay, go. -- All right
boss, you coming?
no. Take Dr. Cranston. Let her drive.
you can lie down.
shrinks love that, McGee.
where are we going, Agent McGee?
potential suspect's house.
so, doing field work without Agent DiNozzo must be invigorating.
puts you in charge.
Yeah, I'll admit, it does feel pretty good sometimes, yeah.
you were the one who didn't start out in the military or law enforcement.
the only one with an Ivy League education, yet you successfully transformed from probie to Special Agent.
who told you about probie?
I'm one of you guys now, right?
no more, no more getting coffee, no more hazing?
sure. -- All right.
you've done an amazing job of growing, you're technically astute.
something feels, uh... stunted.
stunted? How?
women. Deep down, wouldn't you like to be in a committed relationship?
would you maybe want to get some coffee together one morning?
Yeah. Um, sure.
you're asking me to dinner?
you know, you doing what you do, it's, uh, it's interesting to me.
I'd like to know more.
Yeah, but, um, I don't think you really would.
you're hiding something, and I seek it.
speak.
I've been seeing this girl.
that's nice.
actually, it's not nice.
she, uh, stole my mail and took out $65, 000 in preapproved credit cards in my name.
throw her psycho ass in the brig.
I love you, McGee.
that should be enough.
you know, I guess I just haven't found the right girl yet.
maybe.
or maybe you're looking too hard.
you-you can do this?
with a warrant.
all right, wait out here.
anyone home?
I thought you said the suspect was still on board the Colonial.
he is, but it's still protocol to check.
didn't I tell you to wait outside?
psychiatrists never listen.
no paintings of clowns on the walls.
I guess that's a good sign, huh?
well, care to analyze this, Doctor?
what do you think-- gun nut?
I was thinking something more clinical, but gun nut works.
Yeah.
damn right I requested mast.
seaman Leonard, what was your complaint?
XO played favorites.
guys he had high hopes for.
I wasn't one of them.
maybe Commander Reynolds was just an excellent judge of character.
we'll never know now, will we?
can you tell me where your Russian TT-30 is?
seems to be the only gun missing from your house.
gave it to a friend.
guy in Ohio, collector.
if he didn't file the right paperwork, it's not my problem.
if the gun is no longer in his possession, it is most certainly your problem.
come on.
it's frustrating, isn't it?
you make a choice, follow directions, and... it still doesn't work out.
it's just a candy bar; it's no big deal.
who said I was talking about a candy bar?
okay... Doctor... You want to do this now?
why not?
how far back do you want to go?
my mom died when I was eight.
they sent me away to school when I was 11.
I almost lost that kid... in Baltimore.
are we doing it? Am I doing good?
two roads diverged in a yellow wood... and sorry I could not travel both.
another opportunity like this might not come up for years.
these orders are for you.
NCIS Rota, Spain?
your own team.
Congratulations.
I'm passing, on the promotion, Jenny.
we make decisions... and we live with them.
some decisions are easier than others.
that's the, uh, victim's brother.
Peter Reynolds. Just flew in. The only family the commander had.
know anything?
about the commander's time aboard the Colonial?
no. About a long-term relationship; plenty.
girlfriend never came up.
probably because she was married.
you got a name?
Peter only knew her by "Nancy."
McGee, I need to talk to Admiral Hargrove's wife.
find her.
I can't right now. I'm swamped, okay? I love my job. I love my Gibbs.
I need more sleep and...
I am learning to not be so hard on myself.
see how much time we just saved?
well, I know for a fact that you can, uh, work and talk at the same time.
you are a champion multitasker.
okay... I'm scared.
of what?
well... what if I...
tell you a bunch of stuff, and then I learn things about myself that I totally hate?
that could happen, but... unlikely.
okay then, go ahead.
criticize me. I'm ready.
I have nothing to criticize.
y-you are so totally grounded in self-confidence.
you make Goth look... gorgeous and fun.
I'm not a Goth.
I'm a... scientist.
and a great one.
but you work too hard.
is there any Abby time?
I make sandwiches for the shelter, on Sundays.
that's not relaxing.
I... drive for the food bank.
all work and no play.
do you ever hang out with any of your female co-workers?
I heard you're going to Norfolk.
it shouldn't be a problem. We should still be able to leave by 6:00.
leave?
for where?
you two are spending the weekend together.
hold on, let me paint a picture.
you're a pig.
I miss Kate.
if you-if you didn't, I'd be concerned.
you need someone to fill that void.
well, it's not like I have a lot of time to look.
Mmm... certainly not Gibbs.
and Ziva, she's seeing somebody.
how about McGee?
no. No!
why not?--N-no.
because.
McGee... and I, we're... We had... we're... friends.
he stay at your place? -- Yep.
you sleep in the coffin, McGee?
coffin?
y-you said that it was-it was a boxed sofa bed.
it is! Sort of.
I can't believe I slept in a coffin!
n-not just slept.
look, um, this has been really great and all, and you're not half as creepy as I thought you would be, but this place, and my job, it means everything to me, and I'd really like to get back to it, please.
work.
tape adhesive.
agent Gibbs.
you know why I called you?
my husband told me what happened to Vincent.
they were close, you know?
Oh... I think the two of you were... a lot closer than that, ma'am.
I'm sorry?
he's dead. It's okay.
Vincent and I saw each other for over 20 years.
he knew it could never be more than that.
the admiral didn't know?
if he did, he never said anything.
we only got together when my husband was away.
commander Reynolds had to retire from the Navy.
he didn't have kids; he didn't have a wife.
you take the Navy away from him, he didn't have anything to look forward to; not even you.
what are you suggesting, Agent Gibbs?
I'm sorry for your loss.
director... do you have a moment?
how's it going?
well... I'm learning more about your team than I thought I would.
well, I don't know if that's a good thing.
I've never met a group of agents so connected to their work.
Yeah, for better or for worse.
that feeling translate up the ladder?
you've had a rough run.
been through severe trauma recently.
have you spoken to anyone about what just happened?
I don't think I like where this is headed.
this is not about me, it's about them.
you're team director.
do you know what I've had to sacrifice for this job?
for the Navy?
comes with the situation.
what do you know about my situation?
since I got hurt, we've been on SECNAV's radar.
when the vacancy was created at the top of your agency, you induced me to give you this post.
and the deal was quite simple: get your house in order.
and I want to prove that recent events haven't influenced things around here.
my life is a lie.
you were never supposed to succeed.
I think the recent attempt on your life absolutely terrified you, and now you're questioning yourself.
if you let your guard down for one minute, what are you worried about losing?
Yeah. It's Vance.
go, Gibbs.
are you sure?
I need these crew members assembled in your mess hall, Captain.
breaking rule number one, boss.
Yeah. Again.
they worked closely with Commander Reynolds.
that's why we need them, sir.
they know who killed your XO.
what was your relationship with Commander Reynolds?
he was a respected officer.
great XO.
father figure.
was he hard on you?
he made us better sailors.
commander Reynolds' father was in World War II and in Korea.
did you know that?
no, sir.
this is the weapon he carried.
it was given to him by a Russian officer.
XO had it with him on board.
and, as you know, that's a big no-no aboard a Navy vessel.
does it look familiar?
we found tape residue on the commander.
the only DNA on it was his own.
so we were thinking, well, what if he taped the gun to his hand so it wouldn't move, no matter what.
commander Reynolds was nine months away from mandatory retirement in the Navy.
he didn't have a family.
his career was over.
so your XO... was about to lose everything he cared about.
you discovered the body, Ensign?
Yes.
you didn't want him remembered as a weak man, so with the petty officer's help you made it look like a murder?
the gun was still attached to his hand when I walked in.
didn't seem right.
we knocked some things onto the floor around the bunk.
made it look like a scuffle.
didn't see the bullet casing.
he was a man of honor; he deserved to be buried like one.
what do you see when you look at him, Agent DiNozzo?
man works his whole life, dedicates himself to his job, and then has nothing to show for it.
how does that make you feel?
afraid.
I'm a good agent, Dr. Cranston.
a really good one.
I-I know.
and so do a lot of other people.
you're not authorized to give out my phone -- Agent Todd...
you are interrupting my negotiation.
well ，it's kind of beautiful up here.
and dangerous.
well, from this height, you can't really tell.
I was referring to you.
I thought you were going to attack me back in Iggy's stall.
how was I supposed to know what you were planning?
well, we're a team, Kate.
you're supposed to follow my lead.
Oh, even when I don't know where it's going?
especially then.
but you can be more.
has anyone ever told you that?
you're afraid, aren't you?
you ever seen me afraid?
well, not when the danger is something that we can confront.
why aren't you sick?
cause I'm stronger than you, Tony.
you're not... -- Am too.
maybe Agent Todd was hard on you because she knew what you were really capable of.
too bad she never got a chance to tell you that.
I think I just realized who you are... Rachel.
so how'd we do?
I can't tell.
doctor-patient privilege.
Aw, come on, Doc. It's me.
still one agent I haven't spoken to yet.
well, that's not going to happen.
I forgot.
you're perfect.
no, no, I'm just too set in my ways to change now.
you know when you were lying there a second ago...
you looked just like your sister, you know that?
I heard you quit, Agent Todd!
happy news gets around fast.
Yes, I resigned.
it was the right thing to do. -- Yep.
pull that crap at NCIS, I won't give you a chance to resign.
is that a job offer?
protection detail's over, Kate.
you did good.
for once, DiNozzo's right.
I thought I'd die before I ever heard a compli
I'm glad you reached out.
did you find what you were looking for?
finally... got to meet the people closest to Kate when she died.
closure.
some. Some.
you've been better at letting go than I have.
you don't forget, you just move on.
come on, I want to show you something.
where are we going?
home.
stand right here.
right there.
look down. You feel that? Right there?
what?
this is where the guy who murdered Kate died.
this is where Ziva shot her own brother.
that, Doc, is closure.
now, the rest is just memories.
there's nothing wrong with memories.
Kate, sweetie, listen to me-- I got your message.
I can't work with Gibbs. He doesn't appreciate anything.
uh... of course he appreciates what you're doing, or he wouldn't have asked you to come work there.
uh... so what if he gives you a hard time?
don't let Gibbs get to you.
you are damn good at your job, and you know it.
I do know, sis. It's just... I'm just having a bad day.
Thanks, Rachel. I love you.
I love you, too, baby sister.
let's talk soon.
okay. Bye. -- Bye.
never went to the funeral.
just couldn't do it.
families all grieve in different ways.
let me ask you a question, Gibbs.
see if you can answer.
man walks into a bar, asks the bartender for a glass of water.
bartender pulls out a shotgun, fires a blast, just missing the man.
man says "Thank you," puts a tip on the bar, and exits.
why the "thank you..." and the tip?
the guy had the hiccups.
it's all about responses, Gibbs.
you, Vance... your agents.
we keep things piled up inside... even the harshest response seems appropriate.
director Vance, spending time with your team has been enlightening, to say the least.
in clinical terms, they're a disaster.
but their selfless dysfunction is ultimately why it works.
it's clear to me we all react to life's challenges in different ways.
your people are no exception.
some fight death, and some embrace its solace.
some recognize their fate...and others do whatever is necessary to alter it.
sometimes we defy others' expectations, and, occasionally, we rise to meet them.
but the constant, is being true to ourselves.
we do what we have to, when we have to.
we react, for better or worse.
it's why your team succeeds.
but be careful.
eventually, it might catch up to you.
a man walks into a bar and asks the bartender for a glass of water.
the bartender pulls out a shotgun...
the State Department's breathing down my neck.
I'm due in MTAC in 15 minutes to brief the White House.
sir. - Shut up, DiNozzo!
agent David! Put that equipment back in the truck.
this is an FBI crime scene now.
if this isn't rectified in 48 hours, I want DiNozzo and McGee's badges on my desk.
we're outside the United States Embassy in Vlastimil, Belgravia, where a crowd has gathered, anxiously awaiting the arrival of Belgravian Defense Minister Andor Gorgova, for his first face-to-face meeting with the U. S. Secretary of State.
not our war! Not our war!
delegates from both countries have been in closed-door sessions, laying the groundwork for a treaty establishing a U. S.-forward base in Belgravia.
Gorgova all but defines the New Europe.
aligning his country with the United States...
not our war! Not our war!
...have been constant protests, causing some...
not our war! Not our war!
u. S. Marines and Secret Service agents from both countries stand guard.
the official signing of the treaty will be tomorrow, at the Royal Palace, with the Belgravian Prime Minister in attendance.
this is Warren Gates reporting from Vlastimil.
stop!
stop! Stoi! Stoi!
okay, boss. Here we go.
my eyes are so close together, but I got big ears.
having fun there, are you, DiNozzo?
Oh, hey, boss.
it's just this new app，it's great.
it's pretty funny, sometimes.
wanna see what I did to McGee? He almost looks normal.
no.
Thanks, boss.
so why didn't you answer my text? - Text?!
Oh... gosh.
sorry, it was on vibrate.
it is Tuesday, Tony.
the blood drive? 8:00 to 10: 00.
we all gave.
Oh, n... - Where were you?
Oh, that's today, from 8: 00 to 10: 00.
and it's just after 10: 00, so I guess, well... There's always next year, though.
they're gonna be there every morning this week.
of course, I could always try and do it tomorrow.
you're pushing to make Agent of the Year.
it's not going to look good if you don't give.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
Yeah. I'll be right up.
this... is my Rembrandt.
we were aware of opposition to the treaty, but an assassination attempt wasn't on the radar.
so what happens next?
thankfully, Defense Minister Gorgova won't be intimidated by terrorists.
the Secretary of State suggested, for security reasons, that the signing of the treaty be brought here.
we need protective service assistance.
CID is up in the rotation, so we're taking the lead, Leon.
but we need some help from NCIS.
that's no problem.
but I'd like to discuss Sergeant Jennings' death.
that investigation is being handled by the Belgravian authorities and the State Department's regional security office.
now, the cause of the Marine guard's death is known.
they're focused on a local dissident group.
not much more needs to be done.
special Agent Gibbs.
question: What's the disposition of Sergeant Jennings' body?
it's being sent to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, in Dover.
so you're not asking us to investigate his death.
you just want us to protect Gorgova?
general?
no. We've got him covered, and the other members of the official delegation.
we're giving you guys a break on this one.
just as a precaution, until the treaty signing, we need NCIS to protect Gorgova's daughter, Adriana.
she's a graduate student at John Hamilton University.
anything we can do to assist.
appreciate your help, Leon.
Adriana Gorgova has been studying in the United States for the last six years.
she received a bachelor's degree from Princeton University, and she's currently a graduate student in Diplomatic Studies at John Hamilton.
pale, dull... a brainiac.
she's a female you, Timmy.
her father is a self-made millionaire.
he modernized factories and resurrected the moribund Belgravian transportation equipment industries.
then turned to politics. Became the country's Defense Minister.
rich daddy.
sounding better all the time, Timmy.
What'd the embassy say?
they tried to set up an introductory meeting for us with Adriana, but she was unavailable because of her class schedule.
however...
they gave me an address... just off campus.
go, Ziva, find her. Take McGee with you.
we'll double-team her, 24/7, portal-to-portal.
you got a problem, McGee?
well, Army CID gets to protect the Defense Minister and the other official delegates,
NCIS gets his daughter?
what do you want me to say?
growing up in Israel, my idea of American college life was Animal Farm.
the George Orwell book?
No! The John Belushi movie.
that's Animal House.
whatever. Did you go to toga parties?
no, I didn't belong to a fraternity.
that's it.
I definitely did not live in a place like that, either.
is that her? - I don't know. You think?
six years in America changes people.
I guess.
excuse me, Miss Gorgova? - Yes?
NCIS Special Agents McGee and David.
I thought I made it clear to whomever called from the embassy
I don't need protection.
I'm fine. Okay?
there was an attempt on your father's life.
I do not think it is your choice.
sorry. I got hung up at work.
give me a minute, Judd. - Sure.
I've lived here independently and have enjoyed my privacy.
my father's identity is known to very few, and I intend to keep it that way.
Adriana, we're... we're late for the study group.
everything okay? - Yeah.
take your protection detail... and shove it.
let's go, Judd.
you will do as you're told, you understand me?
I am 24 years old and have been on my own for six years.
I don't need to be chaperoned by anyone.
you have not been on your own.
I have supported you.
you are in this country on student visa.
it can be revoked immediately.
I am concerned for your safety.
I apologize for my daughter's behavior.
you will see she's very intelligent young lady.
and reasonable!
when she wants to be.
we will watch after her, sir.
thank you.
I'll show you out.
okay. You can tag along, if you want.
but understand I am not changing my routine for you.
I've got classes, I am behind on my dissertation, and I'm training for the National Marathon next month.
we won't get in your way.
I have an appointment for a facial and Brazilian at 4: 00.
you coming?
you're the State Department Regional Security Officer in Belgravia;
you must know something.
you have to understand.
it's pro forma to allow the local authorities the courtesy of conducting the investigation.
well, you have to understand NCIS investigates the death of every United States Marine.
Yes, but...
we've heard that the Belgravians suspect a local dissident group was responsible.
correct. That is the current thinking.
based on what evidence?
based on the group claiming responsibility.
what, a phone call to the media?
the bomber has been identified as a local.
we're trying to tie him to the group.
has anyone been arrested?
no. It's midnight here.
I still have a lot to do.
when the treaty's signed tomorrow in Washington it's going to hit the fan here.
if I hear anything else, I'll let you know.
let's secure Jennings' body from AFIP in Dover, do our own autopsy.
I told you that I would take care of that.
your primary assignment right now is the protection detail.
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!
what? - My computer just crashed!
I've lost everything!
damn it!
well, you know, it's really not possible to lose everything.
mind if I take a look?
this paper's too important. I need somebody that actually knows what they're doing.
well, McGee's pretty good with computers.
among his degrees, he has a masters in computer forensics from MIT.
that's someone in the lobby. Must be our replacements.
yes? - Gibbs.
come on up.
he sounds pleasant.
that's our boss.
a man of few words.
to quote the agent that will walk in here with him,"A functional mute.
I suggest you don't mess with him too much.
all right. There we go. There is your file.
auto-save was turned off, so I took the liberty of enabling it every 60 seconds.
shouldn't have that problem again.
thank you.
what are your other degrees in?
close your mouth, Tony. Her radar's locked on McGee.
boss, there's only the one entrance and no windows that allow access.
special Agent Gibbs.
heard you're the silent type.
see ya, boss.
thank you for helping me, Timmy.
you'll be back in the morning?
Yeah.
Bye.
and who are you?
feels good to give blood.
Yeah, well, for 3, 000 years, bloodletting or phlebotomy was considered therapeutic.
the practice continued till almost the end of the 19th century.
it all started, of course, with the ancient Egyptians.
did you leave one of our guests out last night, Mr. Palmer?
no, Doc. It's me.
protection detail; didn't get much sleep.
and what brings you down here, other than a uncomfortable stainless steel bed?
sergeant Jennings.
Oh, yes.
pursuant to Director Vance's instructions, I spoke with the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology last night.
they were going to e-mail me the details of his arrival.
I'll check on that, Dr. Mallard.
my main concern is they embalmed the body in Germany, and that could impede my autopsy.
my concern is you finding enough trace evidence to I. D.the signature of the bomb maker.
eh, sergeant's remains are scheduled to arrive at Dover at 0900 and...
I had better leave.
traffic is a mess.
keep me posted, Duck. Hold that thing, Palmer.
how long do you think this is going to take?
15, 20 minutes.
professor Fleming is one of the few people on campus who know who my father is.
do you have to come in with me?
I'm sure he can be trusted.
we just need to check the room.
come in.
professor Fleming, mind if my keepers take a look around?
nothing to hide here. Come on in.
Thanks. Just take a second.
sorry. You texting him?
ray? Yes.
he wanted to know what I was doing.
and you can't tell him anything about it.
how long do you think we're going to be together?
you and Ray? - No, us-- Gibbs's team.
I mean, you've been here seven years, Tony's been here longer.
I do think about that myself sometimes.
Tony turned down a post in Spain four years ago.
career-wise, he can't do that again.
do you think you'd want to lead your own team?
Yeah. Yeah, someday, sure.
Adriana still in there?
Yes. - You guys are, uh...
friends.
you're in Adriana's study group, right?
I heard you say you also work?
sort of.
I do odd jobs for a small machine shop in exchange for a place to live.
I will do the revisions and get them back to you by Friday.
so long as I have them by the weekend.
next patient. You ready, Judd?
movie tonight? - Can't.
not funny.
are you here to scold me?
Yes. And not about that.
Tony, you skipped the blood drive again.
you're the only one on Team Gibbs that hasn't donated.
I was up all night guarding the Belgravian brat, you know.
I only got a couple hours of sleep. Now I gotta go and I gotta relieve Ziva.
I'm a busy guy, Abbs.
I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
tomorrow morning.
what?
I don't understand.
you donated your sperm when you were in college.
Yes, it's a much more pleasurable delivery system.
Tony, what is wrong?
nothing.
ever since I was in the hospital...
I've been terrified by needles.
I gotta go.
so are you going to spend any time with your father before he leaves?
I doubt it.
I don't think there's any time for me on his schedule.
gather you two are not very close, huh?
we were, when I was younger.
but things changed.
when he got into politics.
Yeah.
I, too, have, um... a father whose first love is his country.
are his politics as misguided as my father's?
don't get me started on fathers.
are you going to change?
um, no. Agents DiNozzo and McGee are going to run with you.
what's with McGee?
what do you mean?
is there a Mrs. McGee?
what a concept.
no, he's not married.
girlfriend?
not that I know of.
okay, what am I missing here, huh?
we talking about the same guy-- Timothy McGee?
the Ichabod Crane who speaks in algorithms and looks like he has some kind of permanently frumpy expression on his face?
do not listen to him, Adriana.
McGee is a very sweet man.
he is intelligent and he is loyal to a fault.
we are talking about a different guy.
I cannot believe how many pieces of shrapnel his body absorbed.
not exactly shrapnel.
they're called flechettes.
the reports shows that Sergeant Jennings was less than three meters away when the bomb detonated.
his action saved the life of the defense minister and countless others.
I will never understand fanatics who are willing to give up their lives just to make a political statement.
it's nothing new.
suicide bombing as a political tool
well, it can be traced back to the assassination of Czar Alexander II of Russia, in 1881.
alexander fell victim to a nihilist plot, while driving on one of the central streets of St. Petersburg, near the Winter Palace.
you know, Abby's already called me twice.
I think she's pretty anxious to get these samples.
you are dismissed. - Thank you so much.
history lesson to continue on his return.
you should think of running in the marathon next month, Tim.
I train with a group on the weekends. Why don't you join us?
I'll, uh, I'll think about it.
Yeah. - Good.
you know, I ran the Boston Marathon back in '95.
you didn't do so bad, for a guy your age.
anyone else hungry? - Yeah.
there's a great bistro by my house.
they make the best mixta salad.
okay, okay, by me.
let's earn it. Up the stairs.
Tony, why don't you pick up the salads.
the walk will cool you down.
wouldn't want you to cramp up.
I'm going to take a shower.
behave yourself. You're on duty.
Tim! I need your help.
you decent?
you'll find out when you get here.
this is not a good idea.
Tim! - Yeah.
I flipped a switch and the bulb popped.
I can't, uh, shower in the dark.
do you have a stepladder?
in the closet.
wait. We can't do this.
I'm going to go get the ladder.
I'm sorry I fought having you around.
what, me, or an NCIS protection detail?
I've got some spare bulbs in the kitchen.
Tony must've forgotten something.
I'll get it!
No!
adriana! - Don't do it.
stay back. She's ours.
what? - Tony, Adriana's been kidnapped.
two armed men with masks.
What?!
do you see them?
they're heading north!
come on.
out of the way!
this is an FBI crime scene now.
if this isn't rectified in 48 hours, I want DiNozzo and McGee's badges on my desk.
does Gorgova know?
his embassy's been notified by the kidnappers already.
they threatened to kill his daughter if he signs that treaty.
ceremony's been put on hold.
this couldn't have come at a worse time.
boss... this is all my fault.
I take responsibility for what happened here.
you'll have my resignation by the end of the day.
did you break protocol, McGee?
no, but... - I'm responsible.
you are part of a team;
you're part of my team, and I'm sure as hell not turning in my badge!
FBI's here.
all right. There's work to be done. Both of you witnessed the kidnapping.
you cooperate.
and when they are done with you, you get your butts back to the Navy Yard.
guess Agent of the Year's out of the question.
Abbs, what are you doing?
well, it's an ancient Chinese chant to remove bad luck.
what are you burning?
um, Tan Xiang. It's a Tan incense.
that DiNozzo's stapler? - Yes. And that's McGee's book.
do you really think Director Vance would make them resign?
Oh, yeah, he would.
Abbs, you really want to help them
stop chanting and focus on the work.
why am I here?
I analyzed the bomb fragments that Ducky pulled from Sergeant Jennings' body.
the internal payload was a shell, filled with thousands of these teeny-weeny little needle-like thingies.
Yeah. Flechettes. Ducky told me.
they're made out of a unique titanium alloy, It has a very high melting point
1, 900 degrees Kelvin, or 3, 000 degrees Fahrenheit.
that it?
I wouldn't call you down here just for that.
remember how the Unabomber's signature was wood?
well, this alloy plus that marking on the flechette, is the signature of another U. S. bomb maker.
he's been linked to protest bombings on the campus of Texas Western University, and U. S.bases at Subic Bay and the Vieques Islands.
does the bomb maker have a name?
wait!
I know where he is.
ATF busted him two weeks ago.
Tony, I didn't take it.
this time.
don't look at me!
how'd it go at the Bureau?
well, they kept us there last night and most of this morning, which means that we've gone two nights without having any sleep.
they found the kidnappers' car less than a mile from Adriana's apartment.
it was reported stolen two days ago.
car was clean, no prints.
their, uh, forensics came up empty.
do you know why Abby sent this to me?
he made the bomb that killed Sergeant Jennings.
Joe Don Wynn. An American.
how did an American bomb end up in Belgravia?
we have Homeland Security here.
they have nothing like that in Belgravia.
wynn's being brought here from Central Detention.
you think the same people who tried to assassinate Gorgova kidnapped his daughter?
boss, is there something we should be doing?
by now, the FBI's finished processing Adriana's apartment.
wonder if they missed anything.
campfire.
what does he mean?
is he suggesting what I think he was?
I like it.
it was like a geyser, just shooting straight up in the air.
that was a... Good job, guys.
look, even if we can pick the lock, we can't go in there.
chill, McFraidy.
I mean, what's the worst they can do to us? They're already going to take our badges.
they can arrest us for tampering with a crime scene.
I'm sure there's an FBI seal on the door. We cannot break it.
no problemo. Metro PD, ATF...
Oh, yeah-- FBI.
knew this would come in handy. - Where did you get that?
remember that joint crime scene we worked with Fornell
boarding house, downtown.
Yes.
one of his guys left this laying around.
very sloppy.
it'll be like we were never here.
we are so screwed.
so why would I tell you anything?
well, because I can help you.
yeah? How?
I've seen the prosecution's file.
let me give you a little preview how your trial's going to go.
Texas Western, Subic Bay bombings... They got a strong case against you.
Vieques Islands... that one's a slam dunk.
you're, uh... you're being represented by a 26-year-old public defender?
Yeah.
trial's a waste of the taxpayer's money.
you're toast.
so what can you do for me?
Ah, a case like yours is all about sentencing.
you help me... I could talk to the judge.
what do you want?
last week, there was an assassination attempt in Belgravia and we can link you to the bomb.
I don't know what you're talking about.
okay, you want to play games, I'm out of here.
wait-- hey, hey.
all right.
who'd you make the bomb for?
you can talk to the judge.
you tell him I helped you, I can get a deal?
I seen it before.
all right.
this guy approached me a few months ago.
this guy Belgravian?
no. He was American.
he paid me in cash.
what's his name?
I don't know who this guy thought he was dealing with.
he gave me a fake one but I checked him out.
he's a teacher at John Hamilton.
he's a professor.
his real name is Carl Fleming.
so you going to talk to the judge, right?
no. - What?
you said you would.
I said I could. But I won't.
you built a bomb that killed a U. S. Marine.
we don't even know what we're looking for.
we're truffle-huntin.
we're just sniffing around.
that's gonna leave a scar.
it'll give you some character.
I got something.
something was jammed in there.
tripped the bathroom's ground-fault circuit breaker.
I got changed in here before we went running.
lights were working then.
who popped the breaker?
the only other person that went in the bathroom was Adriana.
maybe she got you in here as a diversion so she could open the door.
what are you saying, she was in on her own kidnapping?
how would she know exactly when the kidnappers would come?
she signaled them.
how, Tony? She never left the bathroom.
godfather I: Michael Corleone offs Captain McCluskey.
she hid a gun in the toilet?
no, a cell phone.
Carl Fleming has Belgravian ancestry and a history of arrests for political and anti-military protests.
he's a clich; the radical academic.
customs records show he just returned from a European trip, including a stopover in Belgravia.
and Fleming's tied to both cases.
so he attempted to assassinate Gorgova to stop the signing of the treaty.
maybe when he failed, he kidnapped the daughter.
with her cooperation.
Adriana told us she hates her father's politics.
kidnapping's a hoax.
boss, I've tracked Fleming's cell phone to the 300 block of 14th Street.
could be where he's hiding with Adriana.
it says the signal was coming from within 25 feet of here.
Ziva, check it out.
John Hamilton faculty parking.
could be inside one of these buildings.
boss...
no cell phone. Look at this.
DiNozzo, pop the trunk.
didn't expect that.
if Fleming was behind the assassination attempt and the kidnapping, why's he dead?
Where's Adriana?
so it was really just a, just a lucky thing.
the FBI agents appear to be upset.
from what I understand, it's a complicated situation.
are McGee and Tony still on double-secret probation?
we're pathologists, Mr. Palmer.
we deal in bodies, not gossip.
we searched the area.
went door-to-door with Metro PD.
no trace of Adriana.
they're gonna keep looking. - Yeah, Gibbs.
I think we made the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List.
we were doing our job.
we were investigating Jennings' death, and that led us to finding Fleming's body.
I don't think they see it that way.
the embassy just received a ransom demand for $10 million.
this isn't about politics anymore.
someone else is calling the shots.
the dead man's name is Carl Fleming.
he's an American.
he teaches diplomatic studies at John Hamilton.
minister Gorgova, he's your daughter's faculty advisor.
we suspect that Adriana was involved in her own kidnapping.
no. When it was political, about the treaty, I could agree with you,
agent Gibbs, but Adriana had a substantial trust fund.
she had no need for money.
it's my wife. Excuse me.
the abduction started out about the treaty.
we think that there was a falling out.
now it is about money.
this has gotten very messy.
director Vance, for your sake, I hope you're not just covering for your agents' screw-up.
that is not the case.
keep your people out of this.
let the FBI find the girl.
gentlemen, will you excuse us, please? - Yes, Director.
nothing ever changes, does it, Gibbs?
rules just don't apply to you, do they?
we were doing our job. - Yeah.
when were you gonna tell me about the daughter?
why'd you assume we screwed up?
the girl was in on her own kidnapping, Leon.
it couldn't have been prevented by anyone.
that's your theory, Gibbs.
do you have any proof?!
come on, come on, come on!
I'm going as fast as I can here.
I already called Gibbs!
well, you shouldn't have.
I'll stall him.
Hey, Gibbs!
you got down here really, really fast.
well, yeah, you said you had something, Abbs.
Yep, right. Um, rice.
long-grain rice.
you should know this.
if you ever get your cell phone wet, disconnect the battery and then put the phone into a bowl of uncooked rice.
it acts as a drying agent, and it extracts the moisture from the electronics.
that what you did to the phone found in Adriana's apartment?
Yep. - And?
and we were able to reconstruct its history.
she sent a text message at 2: 48.
that's, like, less than a minute before she was kidnapped, and it was only one word: "Now."
Abbs, do we know who she texted?
um... Well, um... McGee, do we know who she texted?
we do.
the cell phone's registered to Judd Stern. Ziva and I met him, boss.
he's part of Adriana's study group.
lives in an industrial area off campus.
I'm actually a good cook.
I remove your gag... you don't yell?
federal Agents!
federal agents! Freeze!
he's on the move!
get down.
on your knees.
you okay? - Yeah.
we know you were involved.
I never meant for this to happen.
I just wanted to stop my father from signing the treaty.
but Judd got greedy.
he told me Professor Fleming was gonna try to assassinate my father.
where is the professor?
he's dead.
defense treaty was just signed.
Gorgova and his party are departing Andrews at 1345.
Adriana with him?
wait. So she cooperates in her own kidnapping and then gets off Scotch free?
scot.
diplomatic immunity.
What'd I miss?
I mean, you think she was really into me or was it just part of an act?
Ziva, get the phone.
special Agent DiNozzo's desk.
Oh, okay.
I'll tell him, Abby.
get off my phone. Tell me what?
Abby is on her way up with the Red Cross nurse.
uh, boss, I forgot-- I got this dentist appointment.
also I have to validate my new parking I. D.
I want you to meet Samantha.
Hi, Tony.
Samantha's specialty is working with people like you that suffer from trypanophobia.
the fear of needles.
if you want to give blood, I'd like to try to help you.
Yeah, okay.
it's not so much a fear, actually.
I had an incident a few years ago.
where I had bubonic, or pneumonic plague.
it was never really diagnosed...
Hey!
get a room!
sorry!
jerk!
my hero.
we should get back to the party.
Yeah, okay.
so, how long have we been gone?
um, I don't know. Time kind of stopped.
are you being serious?
totally.
my sincerity and sarcasm sound shockingly similar.
that's what it takes?
I've been trying to get a laugh out of you all night.
so, uh, that's what you've been going for, huh?
Yeah. What is this?
motor oil?
I think this car's leaking.
let me turn it on. - Okay.
it's not oil.
Jason, what is it?
big cutbacks in federal spending is the hot topic on Capitol Hill this week, with legislators vowing to trim the federal budget
while spending and staffing cutbacks are likely at many federal agencies...
McGee, I was watching that!
not anymore. Time to hit the showers.
is your shower not working?
why, do I smell?
I cannot smell you from there.
and you're part bloodhound.
come closer.
the answer is Drakkar Noir, vintage 1988.
he buys it off e-Bay.
never forget your first love.
you smell fine, McGee.
thank you, Ziva. - Like lilacs.
a masculine lilac, I'm sure.
the kind that storms beachheads, likes bloody steaks and smacks girls' bottoms.
McGee's shower's broken.
no, it's not.
they said it was late and it's time to...
hit the showers.
Yeah.
Oh! It's an expression!
Ah. But hitting things does fix things.
only according to Gibbs, the Fonz and the far-too short-lived Stephen J. Cannell classic Riptide.
did you shower today?
no. - You should.
I shower three times a week like Brad Pitt.
preserves my natural aroma.
boy, Director Vance wasn't kidding about making changes.
we are gonna lose some people.
we already have.
NCIS investigative assistant found dead in the garage.
good, you got your gear. Come on. Let's go.
somebody stinks.
Leo's bagged the guy's personal effects.
temporary NCIS I. D. says Oliver Froman.
procurement Fraud Division hire.
hired a few months ago. Just let go.
is Terry Thomas still supervisor at the Fraud Squad?
Uh-huh. That'll be a fun interview, huh?
no surveillance cameras, no line of sight from adjacent buildings.
Ducky, can we move the body yet?
no, no yet.
but we can wait.
almost got it.
I've got the liver probe and, uh... Oh, yeah,
I'm stuck.
agent McGee, how soon can we move this poor fellow's car?
um, this is not his car.
don't rush on my account! I'm fine, I'm fine!
I'm fine.
I'll get the jack.
thank you!
so exactly what happened?
um, well, we were at Paul's birthday party at the, uh, at the pizza place.
and me and Lauren took a step outside to get some fresh air.
and she's making fun of me 'cause I watch Victorious on Nickelodeon.
but Victoria Justice is hot, right?
so I said that. She got this crinkly face.
then I said, but not as hot as you.
and then she smiled, and I planted one on her.
and, uh, and there was tongue.
about the body, kid?
Oh, her, her body was slamming.
the dead body?
uh, yeah, that kind of sucked because it was my first kiss.
they get better.
well, usually in the morning, always after work.
then sometimes in the afternoon, depending on what we're working on.
I don't know. I guess I'd say
I shower about 18, 19 times a week.
surprised you have any skin left.
what do you say, Doctor?
I'd say the cause of death is likely massive blood loss from multiple stab wounds to the abdomen, and the time of death, roughly two hours ago.
corresponds with the gate ticket.
time-stamped at 7: 55 p. m.
so he did drive in.
just not in this car.
let's go hunting, McGee.
what about you, David?
when do you feel like showering?
after just about any conversation with you, Tony.
I used to shower in the mornings, but when I'd leave the house with wet hair and it was cold outside,
I'd get a stiff neck.
apparently, that's not just an old wive's tale.
then I started blow-drying, but Tony would notice I was using a hair dryer, and he wouldn't let me hear the end of it.
of course...
that was the end of it.
looks like he packed everything he owns in here.
froman was on the move.
he lost his job and he hit the road.
Yeah, with all his meager possessions.
well, these aren't his.
these are NCIS property tags.
all this stuff was seized.
this guy was looting the office.
froman was last hired, so f-first fired. It wasn't personal.
bet it felt personal to him.
every department's g-getting sh-shaved back.
you know, h-he was one of the first temporary hires.
he knew that, b-but nobody liked b-being let go.
it's a horrible feeling.
you have been through it yourself?
I was a c-c-customer service r-rep.
I answered phones b-before NCIS.
Wow. And they fired you?
Yeah. W-With no explanation.
Gibbs, Terry Thomas.
he was, uh, Froman's boss.
got Froman's computer. Hard drive's been wiped.
but I'm gonna take it downstairs, see what kind of security breach Froman might be.
he had a-a-access ...
notice?
G-Gave him two weeks.
he picked up his final paycheck Friday.
he was just supposed to be a temp.
but one case was lingering.
B-B-Big case. Lot of seized property.
P-Prepping for auction.
who?
go.
you know, h-he'd be terrible at customer service.
liver? - Spleen. Of course.
interest?
psycho.
aren't they all?
the movie, Palmer.
disgruntled employee steals from the office on the way out of town.
stops for a little while and winds up dead just like Marian Crane in Psycho.
spoiler alert, okay? Haven't seen it.
you've had 50 years to catch up on the story of Norman Bates.
Yeah, that's right, Duckman.
the unassuming Gein was known to give gifts
when the authorities finally tracked him down,
Gein was said to have remarked, "I never killed a deer in my life.
Oh! That's gross!
kidney?
liver.
and this is perforated in an upward direction.
the killer is likely right-handed.
13 stab wounds in total.
and judging by the angle of the incision, he or she knows how to handle a blade.
he didn't used amateurish downward stabs like the fictional Bates in the shower scene...
that short knife, narrow blade.
but repeated, rapid, upward thrusts.
Yep.
you knocked.
trying to stay on your good side.
what, is that so hard?
well, has been lately.
you have an update on the assistant?
he helped himself to property he was supposed to be processing, including Leona Phelps.
Leona Phelps is considered the Madoff of the Navy.
she ran the National Armed Forces Credit Union till she segued to the private sector.
she built what basically turned out to be a financial house of cards.
NCIS took her down last year.
Yeah, minimum sentence at a country club.
the least of the charges.
she's left behind a trail of broken lives, but so far, none of the billions that she was responsible for investing.
she's appealing her conviction.
nothing disrupts that prosecution, Gibbs.
what about the scene?
time stamp says he pulled in 20 minutes before.
parked, he walked down two levels.
he got slashed deeper than your budget there.
duck said lividity shows that he was dead before he was stuffed underneath the car.
do you think this could be a case of wrong place, wrong time?
I'll let you know.
any of these personal decisions affect my team?
I'll let you know.
hear me now?
sorry. Had to drop you at Security.
no, I'm at the Home Office.
it looks exactly the same, actually...
maybe our dead guy was running from something, maybe he was running to something.
but if the guy was leaving town, then where was he going?
closest family members are cousins on his mother's side.
they live in Topeka, Kansas.
you don't go see family after losing your job and pulling the plug on your big city adventure.
working for NCIS is a "big-city adventure"?
I'll find someplace to stay.
as long as it's comfortable.
where do you go?
open road?
with a trunkful of stolen goods.
friend's place, then.
I pulled phone logs from his office and his personal cell. Nothing.
he would call ahead.
not if you want to surprise them.
all right, call me later. You, too.
what kind of friends?
they have a criminal record?
you can't have a criminal record and work for us.
and you.
work for us?
for NCIS? E. J. Barrett.
uh, you work in this office?
I think this is my desk right here.
Hey, let me ask you: Does the glare from that skylight bug you?
cause it's a lot of light, and...
is this thing bolted?
I want my desk this way, which would...
you know, how about if we, uh...
we go ask Abby and McGee if they want to track down...
let's take the stairs.
come on. Let's get some air.
it's leather, McGee. It's leather fiber.
leather is skin.
I try not to think about that.
it's flesh.
you're making it hard not to think about.
you know, there's a wide range of leathers other than your typical moo-based ones.
there's pig leather, and there's sheep leather, and there's goat leather.
and then there's chamois, and your high-end exotics, like lizard and ostrich and hippo...
Aw... hippo.
Abby. Do you want me to stop digging through Froman's computer and pay attention to you?
please.
why would you want to get the DNA of that fiber?
there were no fingerprints at the crime scene, McGee.
there were no fingerprints on the crime victim.
there were no fingerprints on this gum wrapper.
the attacker wore gloves.
leather gloves.
no, I saw what happened.
you and me are having a conversation, we're trying to work something out...
Yeah, it is a violation.
there is an expectation of privacy in our own office.
and she's just chatting away. She's right over the hedge.
it is over the edge!
actually, it's over the top,
but it's pushing you over the edge. Huh?
and you know what I think?
what are you guys talking about?
tanning hides. You?
the same.
easy.
so you think our psycho's got a flesh collection?
think he's got a pair of gloves?
finally. All right, I am in.
let's see what Froman was up to.
Ooh. We did not find that.
according to his history,
froman printed out the specs for a warehouse earmarked for the Phelps case.
her entire estate was deemed the result of a criminal enterprise.
rather than secure her 400-acre residence in Virginia,
NCIS took possession of all her possessions.
and relocated them to a secure warehouse.
well, this is a location, guard schedules, security codes, and inventory.
these printouts were nowhere in the items we recovered.
if Froman was selling details on how to rob the entire warehouse, and the buyer killed him rather than pay him...
then we're not looking for a psycho.
we're looking for a crew.
there's gonna be a heist.
Leona Phelps preyed on active and retired sailors.
she lost billions of investor dollars through various shell corporations and ponzi schemes, while amassing a vast personal fortune.
NCIS confiscated and relocated all of Phelps' possessions to a warehouse in Tysons Corner.
her artwork, jewelry, furniture, and various collectibles would recover 75 million at auction.
she was a notorious pack rat.
among other things.
froman had access to the details?
possibly tried to sell them.
like Heat.
the movie, the Michael Mann movie.
private security on the warehouse?
Yeah, we'll take over.
uh, we'll get the inventory. - Take Ziva.
where we going, boss?
camp Cupcake.
gonna visit Ms. Phelps in Alderson Prison?
schemer like her was probably involved.
she's new.
he's old.
wouldn't put it past her. Robbing herself.
you've met Phelps? - Briefly.
she was transferring operations to Europe when my team brought her to Director Vance's attention.
you have a team?
I'm team leader. I have two other agents.
we're transferring here. To D. C.
where from?
spain.
Rota, Spain.
you mean: Rota.
Rota...Yeah. I could never do that.
inventory list.
Yeah. Let's do it.
well, it's unassuming from the outside, you know.
just an old warehouse.
built in the '70s, I think.
modern security measures?
well, we got the place wired with cameras.
keypad entry.
got these swipe cards here.
three-man teams.
ha. Two men work, one man naps.
Oh, you know the drill.
but ain't nothing gone missing.
how would you know? Place looks like Xanadu.
well, we ain't never had any of these paintings come to life and jump out the frame.
you referring to the Olivia Newton-John movie?
weren't you?
Xanadu. Uh... Citizen Kane's house.
Oh. That's a little embarrassing.
Yeah, for both of you.
nice.
Oh, hasn't been anyone unauthorized in here. Save you two.
I mean, this is a cush gig. None of us want to mess with that.
tempting as it may be to play with the toys.
these are Steve McQueen's sunglasses from The Thomas Crowne Affair.
now, that was a heist.
she can't be all bad.
Mr. Wilson, we would like to amplify your security, since your protection measures may have been leaked.
y'all want to set up shop?
fine by me.
feel free to check your list twice.
holler if you need anything.
Mm-hmm. Thank you, thank you.
these thing sold at a European action a few years ago for $70, 000.
that...is ridiculous.
Yeah.
I had the opportunity to transfer to Europe a few years back.
I've never heard you say that.
I heard Director Shepherd offered you a team.
so where was it, exactly?
spain.
Rota, Spain.
you people better be watching my things.
little help, Leona?
perfect.
if I have to play another damn volleyball game,
I'm going to strangle someone.
well, that'd be good.
get you a nice room in the supermax.
yet another cheap suit, hell-bent on railroading me into a conviction.
and they say money's supposed to buy justice.
it clearly can't buy class.
am I talking to you, or your acid-tongued little errand boy?
you know, you don't care about any of the lives you've ruined.
your things have been relocated.
what?
it's the first you've heard of it?
I'm locked in this hole.
your lawyers didn't tell you.
at pushing five figures an hour,
I avoid small talk. With my defense team.
that's tough. Well running dry?
I'll be fine.
sure. Billions unaccounted for.
investing carries inherent risk.
so does lying to a federal agent.
I didn't ask to talk to you, Agent Gibbs.
it was the other way around.
and as charming and clever as you may find yourself, it's not mutual, so get to it.
this is...
is supposed to be in the villa in Seville, and this is all my furniture.
this is...
this is...?
everything.
we suspect that someone might be trying to rob our facility.
a heist.
who do you suspect?
Oh, I don't know, who do you suspect?
I'll be late for my pastry class.
Martha Stewart started it when she was here.
take care, Agent Gibbs.
it's one of Tony's movie myths.
I've never had a good time in a women's prison.
what a horrible woman.
video depositions.
everything we have on her victims.
looking to put a face to her crimes?
Tony and Ziva?
said they plugged the holes in the warehouse security system with motion detectors.
monitoring now.
figure since this crew left the body behind them, they'll probably strike quickly.
Yep.
do you need any help with the...
I can play a DVD, McGee.
it's really sad.
a lot of hardworking people forced out of retirement after having their pensions depleted.
that's all gone now.
Ben managed to find work washing floors at Lincoln School.
he always kept a straight back.
I'm back swabbing the decks on the Lincoln.
he... He joked about that.
paintings come to life.
guy probably thinks he's like Ben Stiller in Night at the Museum.
he's playing baseball with himself.
he's a working stiff.
no magic there.
fiddle Faddle?
what? - You want something to eat?
no.
I have an apple if you'd prefer.
he's gotta have dreams, right?
he can't just go to work, punch the clock, walk the beat, wake up, go back, do it all over again.
here.
why do you keep pushing food on me?
because your blood sugar is dangerously low...
unless something else is bothering you.
my name is Ruleo Medilla.
I drove a sanitation truck in Detroit before I took partial disability.
you need something, Barrett?
no.
you need anything, Gibbs?
night.
motion censor is tripped.
Wilson, what's your 20: 00?
uh, I'm at the guards office.
you have any men on the floor?
negative.
we have visitors.
false alarm, Wilson.
copy that.
Hey, boss, couldn't call ahead?
Nope. I came in the way they came in.
the heist isn't coming.
they pulled it off already.
what?
like a thief in the night?
but nothing's missing.
no. Nothing on this list.
so what did they take?
phelps went straight to this page.
so something interested her here, huh?
Ah. There's a couple options.
I like this desk.
it's old-growth wood.
craftsman laid.
it belonged to William Faulkner.
I love his writing.
total genius. - Yes!
it was worth learning English just for The Sound and the Fury.
or that chapter in As I Lay Dying, you know, the one with the five words where Vardaman says, "My mother is a fish.
I don't really like his books that much, but I'm a big fan of the movies he made based on other people's books, like The Big Sleep and To Have and Have Not.
I mean he gave us Bogey and Bacall.
God bless you, William Faulkner.
dovetail joints don't go with nails.
they've been here. It's been jimmied.
there's gotta be a manual release somewhere.
they did not care about this desk.
no. Only what was in here.
what was that?
Hey, you brought me a new desk.
it's an old desk.
did you find anything on your leather DNA project?
turns out it's impossible.
it's improbable. It's just highly unlikely.
can't really determine much other than the type of cow.
Oh, what is that on the plasma?
Oh, that's... that's a different case.
that's for Special Agent Barrett.
have you met her? She talks to herself all the time.
it's weird. You'll like it.
Yeah. I do not like all the shuffling of desks.
you know what, evidence garage, it's right over there.
careful.
a man was killed for this.
I thought he was killed for what was inside of it.
we do not even know what that was.
challenge accepted.
what kind of a cow?
it's a calf. Holstein.
tacky, Agent Gibbs.
I especially hate the bracelets.
not your favorite jewelry.
what do you want now?
secret panel in your desk, it was empty.
looks like it was pried open with a screwdriver.
I was robbed.
would you like to file a claim?
against you?
for damages? Sure.
no, for your loss.
we'll need to know what was in there.
what's the theory?
well, it must've been valuable.
they went straight for the desk.
didn't touch anything else.
maybe you arranged it yourself.
interesting theory.
it was yours.
two seconds into hearing about the case, you jumped right to it.
broken clocks and blind squirrels.
Really? Just a lucky guess, huh?
I'm still just getting the lay of the land.
Where'd you find that chair?
it was over there in the corner.
so what's your quick read here?
she hates feeling like a prisoner, so Gibbs salts the wound, keeps her emotional. He stays cerebral.
that's how you get a captain's "C" on your jersey.
you a jock, DiNozzo?
basketball. Some other stuff.
varsity?
team captain. Once upon a time.
I was a cheerleader myself.
I never got past JV, though.
kept getting distracted by the boys.
I got to run. I got a meeting with the director.
she'll want a deal.
I know.
what does he want?
anybody else know about the panel?
I had nothing to do with this crime, Agent Gibbs. I'm the victim.
however, I can tell you exactly who you're looking for.
but you need to do something for me.
when they've got all the information they can gather about the victim,
I'd like him to come back here with you.
you been able to find everything you...
thank you, EJ.
that didn't last long.
knocking on my door.
Leona Phelps wants to cut a deal.
deal for what?
the name of Froman's killer.
she could have the name of Jimmy Hoffa's killer.
there's no way we're going to reduce the charges against her.
no, that's not what she asked for.
then what does she want?
get out of prison.
no.
house arrest, pending her appeal.
she knows who targeted her.
you don't make deals, Gibbs.
this one's a steal.
using the few clues from the garage murder and the warehouse break-in,
here's what I found.
six years ago, casino cage, Atlantic City.
two-man team goes in with hot iron.
three guards get bloody. One gets aced.
stick up man goes toes-up on the carpet.
the other goes out the door with 27 million clams.
getaway driver scoops him curbside, guns blazing.
they dump and burn the ride on the Jersey border.
and then they are Casper.
all right, McGem City, where does that get us, huh?
unless you built a proton pack in your spare time, we can't bust ghosts, so...
the guy they left behind has a rap sheet as long as a...
as long as a...
what's really long?
this presentation.
the FBI tracked down known associates of the dead guy and they found nada.
27 million, split two ways?
that's "one last score" kind of money. They're gone.
white sand beaches and umbrella drinks for the rest of your life.
who would come back from that?
that question has to wait till we come back.
uh, boss, McGee thinks he's got a lead on the crew.
I got a quicker one.
Ziva, let's go.
where we going?
to spring Leona Phelps from Camp Cupcake.
you made a deal with her?
you did quick work, Gibbs.
name.
we met in 2005 at my office at home to discuss a business proposition.
among the many objet d'art, he was particularly preoccupied with the Faulkner desk.
your favorite hiding place.
Yes.
his name is Otto Brackin.
McGee, Otto Brackin.
I know. Wait, how do you know?
what do I know?
well, he was a cellmate of the guy who died in the casino heist.
they did a two-year stretch together at Ossining.
where is he now?
virginia State Police found his body a few hours ago. He's dead.
virginia PD says the motel room where they found Otto Brackin's body was trashed.
major struggle.
so, lacerations were on his liver?
identical wounds to those on Froman.
same knife, same style, same killer.
job's done. So, what? He turns on his partner?
there's no honor among thieves.
what, they fight over the split, maybe?
or something went sideways?
leaves the getaway man outstanding.
why is that outstanding?
motel manager got plates and a description.
got a BOLO out on the car. Lexus, stolen.
okay, okay.
this is the second guy to get gutted on this caper.
and somehow this woman's at the heart of it.
it's a heist movie.
so there's just one question that we have to answer:
what would Steve McQueen do?
you know, it seems unfair.
you get to go home for giving us the name of a man who's recently been murdered.
a deal's a deal, Ziva.
you ought to muzzle your pups, Agent Gibbs.
they all seem to have a problem with barking.
no, this one's problem's definitely her bite.
I couldn't have predicted Brackin's death.
and I certainly couldn't have anything to do with it from the inside.
is that why you wanted out so badly?
didn't look so terrible to me.
you've obviously never had your freedom taken away.
a real gift for reading people, this one.
perception is reality.
if I'm seen as a criminal, I'll be treated as a criminal.
despite the lack of hard evidence on the part of prosecution, incarceration sure gives the appearance of guilt.
kind of empty without all your beautiful things.
they're nothing... next to freedom.
do not get ahead of yourself.
if you go beyond that door, we will know about it.
fine. But other than that, you leave me alone.
no police presence!
Yep, that was the deal.
enjoy solitary confinement.
we steal for a living.
we pull off that one last score, McGee, we're set for life.
but the cheese is hot. Where do we stash the cash?
huh. Well, of course, we take a meeting with Leona Phelps, the unscrupulous money manager.
she's not gonna ask questions. Right.
if we invest our stolen money with her...
she'll clean it up, and we'll be fine.
till the whole thing goes pear-shaped.
and we're broke.
that's it.
she doesn't just ruin the lives of good people.
she ruins the lives of bad people, too.
the crooks have to come out of retirement.
they've got to pull off one last, one last score.
I'll cross-reference the names of Phelps' victims with criminal records.
bet we come up with someone who served time with Brackin.
what are they after?
you want to know what was in the desk?
Absolutely.
believe it or not, I found a collagen fiber that I determined to be deerskin.
deer, huh?
um, I also found traces of cellulose mixed in the linen as well as thermochromic ink in the wood.
high-end paper and security ink.
after referencing the Secret Service ink and paper libraries, that is where Leona Phelps stashed
so, all the missing money,
I'm thinking "secret account" somewhere.
and it's all in the ledger, which was all in the desk.
key word: was.
I thought the deal was, I get left alone.
me, too.
that was how Otto convinced me to invest my money with you.
we were never gonna work again.
you ruined that.
Mr. Medilla...
I'm sorry to hear about your partner.
we found the guy who could get us in that warehouse.
we went to all that trouble.
the damn ledger wasn't even there.
I can imagine you must have been very upset.
I was.
I would like to have it now.
you want money.
I understand. I can get you money.
I do.
and more than that...
I want your blood.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
boss, DNA from the gum wrapper matched Ruleo Medilla.
he's the last member of the crew.
phelps lost all their money.
she knew it was them as soon as she heard the word "heist."
she knew what they were after. Same thing the prosecution's after.
same thing you're after.
she had to get out and get it first.
it's a smoking gun.
Uh-huh. What's next?
Bullitt.
Oh, she's on the run.
help!
he's got a knife!
please!
Ziva, stay with her!
you violated your house-arrest agreement.
but for this, you're going away for life.
like Doc McCoy in The Getaway.
yeah? No, not really.
you would have made a great director, boss.
Yeah, well, already got one of those.
McQueen also had Jacqueline Bisset,
Faye Dunaway and Ali MacGraw.
you notice the new girl likes to shower here before she goes home?
Hey, did you hear me?
you know, I was offered your job.
I turned it down.
thank you.
towel, please?
so, why would you do that?
I wanted this team, here in D. C.;
the varsity.
how'd Gibbs feel about that?
well, he left. He gave it to me.
you know, I was pretty good at it.
I mean, I made a couple rookie mistakes, but I was figuring it out.
and then Gibbs took it back?
Yeah, he did.
the previous director, Shepard, she, uh...
she saw something in me.
kept an eye on me.
smart woman.
there are rules against this.
no, there aren't.
God, I feel like all that we've seen is snow for the last few months.
well, it had to melt sooner or later.
Hey, look. Aren't those trees just, like, gorgeous?
Oh, yeah, amazing.
did you know they don't get Wi-Fi up here?
Scott, stop being a jerk.
and, come on, the whole point of this trip was to get away from this...
technology overload.
right. Granola therapy...
it's called "green therapy," idiot.
and you agreed to it weeks ago.
Oh, come on, Scott. Look, it's a beautiful day.
just... take in the nature with me, all right?
you almost splattered nature all over the windshield.
come on.
what? Jane!
let's go, Scott. I want a picture.
she's beautiful.
Yeah, well, she's wearing a coat; I'm not.
can we please go back to the car? It's freezing.
Oh, my God. She's looking at us.
that's because we look really stupid right now.
Oh, my God.
tell-all
McGee, tampering with someone else's mail is a federal offense, is it not?
I believe it is, Ziva.
and we are federal agents.
so it'd seem it's our duty would be to arrest him.
how do you know it's not mine?
because it's addressed to Gibbs.
eagle eye, McGee.
what else do you see? - Tony, why are you trying to look at Gibbs' mail?
Oh, come on. Isn't it obvious?
the raised calligraphy, the paper that's made from a fabric more expensive than Timmy's shirt.
sorry.
he got the same wedding invitation last week.
how would you know that? - I saw it.
same fancy paper, same fancy handwriting.
well, someone's being persistent.
who would want to invite Gibbs to their wedding?
Yeah. Guy's got worse wedding juju than Billy Bob Thornton, and Larry King combined.
you are overreacting.
I, for one, would not mind having Gibbs there when I get married.
Hypothetically!
I mean, you know, When I... someday... you know, if I...
it is not important. - Clearly.
so what does your "Ray of sunshine" think?
we have not discussed it. - I see.
Raymondo... plays his cards close to the vest?
Raymondo and I have not discussed the future.
we are taking it... slow.
think that's a very smart idea, Ziva.
thank you very much, McGee.
now you're taking love advice from Agent Hot Britches there?
man who makes Belgravian princesses swoon and hot blonde gamers overload?
how's that going, by the way?
how about you, Tony?
seems like your libido has been very satisfied lately.
are you taking it slow... with anyone?
nothing a cold shower in the agents' locker room wouldn't cure.
more information than I want to know. Grab your gear.
where to, boss? - Dead Navy lieutenant commander outside of Shenandoah.
come on! Let's go.
beautiful spring day.
not as nice as June, of course.
june's perfect for all kinds of events, weddings...
Yes, Henry David Thoreau said that spring was "a natural resurrection, expression of immortality.
well, Ducky, I think Lieutenant Commander Patrick Casey would beg to differ with you.
not if I have anything to say about it.
hon, where did you say we're going to dinner?
Oh, hon..." the commander cares little about your evening plans, Mr. Palmer.
uh, y-yeah, Breena? Breena, I got to go.
Yeah, have fun aspirating the bile.
I am so sorry.
um, she likes to have someone to talk to while she's... embalming.
think you should marry that girl, Palmer.
boss, found an I. D.For Commander Casey.
defense lntelligence Agency.
Secret-keepers, huh?- Yeah.
cash and, uh, credit cards are accounted for, so it wasn't a robbery.
okay, Duck. - Time of death, approximately 11: 00 p. m.
multiple gunshot wounds. And this one suggests hollow-point rounds, though I won't know for certain until I get him back to Autopsy.
got an exit?
uh, Agent McGee, would you help Mr. Palmer roll the body, please?
here we go...
I don't see any. That's odd.
I mean, what goes in, should come out. - Or not.
Gibbs, I believe the commander crawled, trying to make it to the road.
I found a blood trail.
from where? - Boss!
should take a look at this.
commander Casey left a message.
Birdsong"?
looks like it's written in his own blood.
what does "Birdsong" mean?
I wish I could help you, Agent Gibbs, but it could take weeks for the Defense lntelligence Agency to pour over Lieutenant Commander Casey's assignments to determine what can and cannot be released.
are you familiar with something called "Birdsong," Admiral?
the commander, he that wrote that in his own blood before he died.
nothing comes to mind.
well, come on. It's got to mean something.
look, Casey was a good man and a hell of an officer, but we had limited interaction, and I couldn't possibly know every detail of his involvement.
dia pulls people from different parts of the service.
determined by expertise, on a case-by-case basis.
this man's dead.
you think his "expertise" was related?
I wish I knew.
you said you wanted to help. - Of course.
I'm ready when you are.
what are you suggesting, Agent Gibbs?
I don't know, sir.
you're the one with all those "I was there" ribbons.
you'll be in touch?
boss, Metro PD found Casey's car abandoned outside a restaurant.
unlocked, keys on the ground, cell phone smashed.
looks like he was jumped.
have McGee dig into Casey.
and find me "Birdsong.
cellular communication, text messaging, squeaking...
it's "tweeting," Doctor.
like the little yellow canary and the puddy tat.
I used to love that cartoon when I was a kid.
these distractions feed the ever-growing beast known as instant gratification.
I promise it will never happen again.
I'm going to call Breena immediately and let her know that our chats have been getting...
No! - No?
well, yes, no... you're completely missing the point.
if you keep in constant contact with your lover, she will get to know you too well.
I don't follow.
you lose... the thrill of discovery, the mystery of not knowing.
secrets, if handled properly, can be extremely alluring.
Ah, Jethro, I was just telling Mr. Palmer the benefits of self-restraint.
just tell me what you got, Duck.
well, I've determined the type of rounds used to kill the lieutenant commander.
he was shot six times with frangible ammunition.
each bullet was made of sintered copper, designed to disintegrate into powder and fragments upon impact.
the dispersal of these accounts for the extensive damage beneath the dermis.
and as there was no residue on his clothing to indicate that the shooter was close...
we're looking for a weapon...
that fires frangible ammo at a distance.
it's rare, Duck.
Yeah, anything more specific will have to come from Abby.
I already brought some fragments up to her.
whatever her findings, it's an odd choice of weapon.
I mean, either the killer was unfamiliar with the weaponry or, well, maybe he wanted this poor fellow to suffer great pain.
or both.
lieutenant Commander Patrick Casey. Born in Pensacola, Florida.
his parents were career Navy.
both are now deceased; Patrick followed in their footsteps.
dia kept him... traveling, but unfortunately, his destinations remain classified.
you lose something, DiNozzo?
no, boss.
did you find something? - No...
Oh, about the... uh, yeah, kind of.
the waiter at the restaurant where Casey's car was found said that he dined with a woman.
uh, wasn't a date, though.
they shook hands at the end of the meal.
then she left. Casey stayed until just before closing.
the waiter's working with the sketch artist now.
Tim, talk to me.
boss, I am knee-deep in the DIA servers here.
listen to this: Three days ago, the department's general counsel got their hands on a manuscript they had heard of.
potential leak of classified military information. - Yeah, and?
the title of the manuscript was "Operation Birdsong.
somebody looking to publish it?
capitol Crossroads Press.
it's a boutique publishing house run by Madeleine DuMont.
book like this could really take her little imprint to the next level.
what's the connection to the case? - Nothing yet.
but there's only one way to find out.
find the publisher, McGee... Ms. DuMont.
well, why me?
you're the writer, right?
you're in the women's shower, fully clothed, and... you are holding Gibbs's mail.
what's your point?
that letter is not for you to read. - I know.
but there's so many questions to be answered.
the happiest day in someone's life, and they need Leroy Jethro Gibbs there to seal the deal?
doesn't make any sense.
all right, so be honest.
surely, you would want Gibbs there at your wedding.
well, I don't know if a head slap coming down the aisle is the ideal Kodak moment.
maybe you're right. - Okay, so, I have a question.
have you seen Agent Barrett?
no.
why do you keep asking about her?
I have only asked you once.
why here? - You mean, in the shower?
because I have seen her here, I guess. She intrigues me.
does she intrigue you?
well... I can't really...
she must be assembling her team.
I wonder when she's due back. - Me, too.
pardon me?
I should stop this.
you should stop... what, exactly?
this. Everyone deserves their privacy.
even Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
see you.
have we met?
um, no, no, never. Absolutely not.
I rarely forget a face.
and there are some very interesting ones in the book world.
yours is... memorable.
I am not in the book world, Ms. DuMont.
you run out of words, McGee?
come on. You're a writer. Find some.
who is this? Another agent?
another "special agent.
Gibbs. - Delightful.
more Feds. Who knew I'd be a threat to national security.
we're not the first federal agents you've seen?
I've had half a dozen DIA agents in and out of my office for days.
What'd the DIA want?
what the government does best: Meddle in the affairs of small businesses.
they confiscated a manuscript we're about to publish.
all hard copies and digital files.
the title of this book wouldn't happen to be Operation Birdsong?
the very same.
they even sent an admiral, if you can believe that.
Hindley. Awful man.
said it was for reasons he couldn't disclose.
what's it about? - Weapons sales.
corruption.
intrigue.
a lot of unfortunate people involved.
you should read it.
who's the author?
an anonymous former intelligence operative.
that's all I told Hindley, and that's all I'm telling you.
the freedom to write anonymously is protected by the First Amendment.
Yeah. - I know about the First Amendment, McGee.
if you want me to disclose the author's name, you're going to have to prove to a judge that the book really does pose a threat to national security.
hindley wasn't exactly eager to share its contents, even with a judge.
and... since you don't have a copy...
no. No words.
just a picture.
ms. DuMont, this book may be related to a murder we're investigating.
his name is Lieutenant Commander Patrick Casey.
you know him?
Yes.
he was one of two people sent an advance copy; Author's request.
who's the other one?
read a book, die mysteriously.
I'm not buying it.
only happens with cursed videotapes, you know, like in that movie The Ring or the original... Ringu.
okay. Thank you, McGee.
so McGee just called Elise Archer's office at the FBI.
she did not go to work today, and she's not picking up her phone.
playing hooky, huh? I would never do that.
agent Archer! NCIS!
Elise Archer was an expert in anti-domestic terrorism stings.
set up phony weapons buys for homegrown extremists;
made the arrest before anyone was put in any real danger.
she was a good agent. Great baker.
you should have had her baklava.
duck... talk to me.
this nylon rope used to strangle Agent Archer was the same that was used to bind Lieutenant Commander Casey's hands.
murders are related. - Probably.
and Agent Archer was killed after the lieutenant commander.
cause of death was almost certainly asphyxiation, based on this particular hemorrhaging, and the ligature marks on her neck.
but... - But... I hate that "but.
there are no defensive wounds.
now, with a strangulation, one would expect her to wrestle with her attacker;
fight to save her life.
and yet... here... nothing.
it's almost as if she just gave up.
that doesn't sound like Archer. She was a fighter.
she worked hard to get where she was.
dia?
she was loaned out... a few months last year.
covert ops. Above my pay-grade.
boss, Archer does match the sketch of the woman who had dinner with Casey last night.
and I also found this.
the husband works as a paramedic for a DC-based ambulance company.
been on a 14-hour shift since last night. Ziva's tracking him down.
I never met him.
she always said nice things.
Hey.
you get an invitation to Diane's wedding?
Yeah. I got three.
three?
woman always was persistent.
Tobias, she was a pain in the butt.
you going? - Are you?
Hey, boss, someone set a fire in here recently.
could be the remnants of our book.
bag it, McGee. Get it to Abby.
you really think this is the reason for both murders?
I don't know; we have to read it first.
you know, Jethro...
if it weren't for Diane...
we wouldn't have the kind of relationship that... we have.
Tobias, you've always been a glass-half-full kind of guy.
never have to pay alimony again.
I can't believe Elise is gone.
she, uh... she was always worried about me... you know.
said I was the one with the dangerous job.
rocketing through the DC streets in the middle of the night, the junkies wielding syringes.
she was just a paper-pusher at the Bureau.
or at least that's what she told me. She...
she couldn't talk about her work much.
and I didn't ask too many questions.
who did this to her?
Mr. Archer, there's been another murder besides your wife, and we think that the two might be connected by a book they were reading.
a book? - Operation Birdsong.
that was on Elise's nightstand.
she'd been reading it the past couple days.
said it was about a weapons deal or something.
how does a stupid book get my wife killed?
hold this, will you?
thought you were going to buy me a nice lunch.
what? - Nothing.
I'm just thinking about the day I married Diane.
Why? - Stirred up memories.
yeah... well... Bad ones. - Not really.
our heads were in the clouds.
we were giddy kids. We were in love.
Oh, you probably had the flu. - Oh, come on, Jethro.
before it got bad, there must have been some good times.
she caught her finger in a car door once.
Hey, Abbs! Got your book.
great.
you know it's supposed to be burned after reading, not before.
I'm having flashbacks of high-school English class.
fahrenheit 451.
which had the unintended consequences of igniting my interest in arson science.
no pun intended. - Abby.
um, okay.
I ran the frangible ammo that Ducky pulled from Lieutenant Commander Casey through every weapons database that I could access.
and...? - And... Nothing.
but that's not possible.
and I know that that's not possible.
so I said to myself,"Self, why would the weapon used not be in any weapons database?
and you know what self said? - Because it's a prototype.
I may not be able to serve my country as a Marine anymore.
but that doesn't mean I can't serve it.
writing that book?
that was my duty.
anything? - No.
Yes. Yes. No, no. Go back, McGee.
Tony, you're hogging all the end pieces.
that's because I start with the end pieces.
haven't you ever done a puzzle before? You go out to in.
have you ever done a puzzle before?
because you work in to out.
