Miraculously,very little damage has been made on the Angkor region as a result of the bloody civil that has terrorized the Cambodia for over 30 years. The Khmer Rouge,an extreme-left organization has actively organized guerrilla activities against Prince Sihanouk's government. In 1975,many Buddhist monks who lived in the Angkor temples were massacred along with the majority of the Buddhist population as a result of a "social reorganization." However,Angkor Wat suffered very little structural damage in that attack. Today,archeologists from all over the world are actively involved in the restoration process of the temples. Much of the history of the "Lost city" of Angkor is still a mystery,but Angkor has entered the "Coca Cola"and "Kodak" age, and as Cambodia is becoming more developed,the mystical atmosphere at Angkor will disappear.
