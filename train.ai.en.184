boc accounted for about half of all minibond sales.
boc also said it was actively considering foreign acquisitions and hoped to accelerate the expansion of its overseas business.
boc and temasek, the singapore state investment agency, are planning an ambitious scheme involving hundreds of branches.
boc has also been investing in private banking for its hong kong subsidiary as part of efforts to profit from the wealthy first-generation mainland entrepreneurs who are a key source of investment and commercial banking business.
boc is the first chinese bank to widely offer non-corporate rmb deposit services outside hong kong and mainland china but because of beijing's strict controls on convertibility and capital account transactions the service remains extremely limited.
boc said the deal was abandoned because the bank did not receive approval from the chinese banking regulator before a deadline of march 31, after the deadline had already been extended from december 31.
boc tian jintianjin and boc international shall strengthen education on investors, sufficiently disclose investment risks to investors so that investors might have ideas of self-assumed risks.
boc tian jintianjin shall improve account classification management and establish independent book-keeping titles.
boc's chairman and party secretary, xiao gang, called on the "whole bank to swiftly leap into action, unify thinking around the central leadership's analysis, opinion and decisions, wholeheartedly support the expansion of domestic demand and search for development opportunities in the midst of the crisis."
boc's mr wang said the bank would launch similar products "very soon."
boc's platform is also likely to be marketed to high net worth individuals.
boc's position at the centre of the controversy has been embarrassing for the chinese government, especially given accusations against the banks of mis-selling to vulnerable individuals.
boc's surprise interest underscores renewed willingness in beijing to consider investing in selective overseas financial assets. This is despite a recent string of disastrous investments in foreign banks and insurers.
