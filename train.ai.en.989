Yes. I heard.
well, to be honest, it's been hard, especially coming back to this big, empty house.
not to mention the subtle glances I get from people judging me.
but you know what I say? To hell with them.
thank you.
I'll see you.
Oh, hey, and if this house gets too lonely,
I'm looking for a room to rent.
I mean, Mike and Susan are great, but it's gettin' a little crowded over there.
okay, I'll keep it in mind.
mm, for what it's worth, it might take the heat off of you.
no one judges the woman from the Looney Bin when there's a stripper next door.
this is great.
I haven't had a female roommate since after college.
let's hear it for girl power!
you know, we should go out and have a drink celebrate.
Oh, I don't know.
my therapist says I should get out more, but...
either being or at Gaby's house the other day, it's...
it's just hard.
Yeah, I get that.
so what was it like being in a mental hospital?
you know...
as much fun as one would expect.
I only ask 'cause of my mom.
she used to use me as a punching bag, and I always dreamed about having her committed.
I'm sorry.
Oh. No, it was only when she was drunk.
it was her way of coping with my dad cheating on her all the time.
I remember wishing that he was ugly so other women wouldn't want him.
but he looked like Clint Eastwood.
anyway, mom had to take out her anger somewhere, and I was an easier target than a 6'4" trucker.
actually...
it was pretty bad at the hospital.
people always say it's the screaming that gets to you.
but at least screaming means you're alive, you know?
what I couldn't take were the people with the blank stares.
there was this one woman who sat frozen in the garden all day, whispering the words to "old Macdonald had a farm"
over and over and over.
the doctors ever take offense when she got to "here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack-quack"?
you know what?
if there were ever two people who deserved a night out drinking...
it's us.
okay... - Mm-hmm?
quid pro quo. - Mm?
I told you what it was like to go to bed in restraints, so I think it's only fair that you tell me what it was like being a stripper.
Ooh. It was brutal.
if I had a dollar for every guy that slapped me on my butt just 'cause he felt like it...
come to think of it, I do.
excuse me. Uh, my friend and I were wondering if you'd like to join us at our table.
no, thank you. It's girls night out.
two beautiful women in a bar. Can't blame a guy for asking.
Mm.
uh, we're over there if you decide to go coed.
is it bad that I wanna go sit with them?
you do? - Yeah!
it's been a while since a guy had a cutest flirting with me.
you know what? Let's do it.
Really?
Yes. You look way too hot to waste it on just me.
shall we? - Mm!
come on. You've gotta have a secret.
Nope. It's shampoo and conditioner. - Well, it looks amazing.
you should be on the cover of hair magazines.
what is it you said you do? - I didn't, but my friend Katherine is starting her own catering company. - Oh, well, thinking about it.
cooking's a passion of mine.
but a lot has to happen before I start my own business.
Oh.
I know. You're a model.
no.
Oh. Uh... dental hygienist?
no.
Oh, I know. You're a flight attendant. - Mnh-mnh.
you may as well tell me, - or I'm just gonna keep guessing all night. - She's a stripper, okay?
ex-stripper. I'm sorry.
Oh, hey, why are you apologizing? We love strippers.
Yeah. They're like angels of mercy...
that show their boobs.
we should probably get going.
W... what are you talking about? We haven't even danced yet.
Oh, I don't really feel like dancing, although I can't speak for Katherine here.
well, it's just, I wanna dance with you.
you're not attracted to someone who's classy, witty, not to mention breathtakingly beautiful?
no offense to your friend, but you're more my type.
Oh. Well, in that case,
I guess I'll just keep her all to myself.
night, guys.
God...
the look on their faces... - Oh, I know.
it was the perfect combo of "I am so turned on"
and "I am so going home alone."
you should remember that the next time you want to get out of a bad date.
Oh, no, I don't think so.
those two pigs confirmed what I've been thinking for a while now...
I think it's time for me to give up on men.
Mm. Amen, sister.
it's official. My dating days are over.
I mean, you don't have to take it that far.
you could always just do what I did
and explore other options.
what do you mean?
cast a wider net?
expand the pool?
date chicks?
Oh.
so you're...
Yep.
Card-carrying.
I thought that kiss felt awfully convincing.
well, I mean, I dated guys for a long time and...
I just never really felt a connection.
and then I started stripping, and I was surrounded by all these confident, sexy women, and I realized, - "Robin, sweetie, you have been barking up the wrong tree." - Hmm.
Yeah, I think I got the right tree.
just sick of barking.
well, suit yourself.
uh, you're okay with this, right?
I mean, it's not gonna affect anything with us?
I... I don't see why it would.
okay.
Hey, Robin. What are you up to?
just out for a walk. It's such a nice day.
Yeah, it is. So how do you like the neighborhood?
is everyone treatin' you okay? - I guess so.
no one's giving you any guff about about being a stripper, - Are they? - Oh, no.
I just wanna make sure, 'cause trust me, I've been there.
way back when, I was sorta in the sex trade myself.
Oh, yeah.
I used to model women's foundation garments For Sars, Roebuck.
these breasts put me through college.
they're real, by the way.
they look real.
Yeah.
anyway, I'm glad that people are treating you nice.
you know what the best part is?
they actually see me.
see you?
I spent a lot of years working in a place where people stared at me all night long.
but no one ever really... Saw me.
you know what I mean?
I do.
and when I first got here,
I thought it was gonna be the same thing. But...
I get the feeling your neighbors see past all the stuff that people usually look at.
it makes me feel really good.
I'm glad.
Robin Gallagher was right.
the people she had met on Wisteria Lane had really looked her, and they had seen her sense of morality, her loyal heart...
her surprising insight, her forgiving nature.
some people had even taken notice of her incredible beauty...
and they were surprised to discover they liked what they saw.
cover me! I'm going ahead of you.
you have no idea...
you forgot my birthday. Wow.
what your neighbors are really like...
chicken box is dangerous for adults. Go! - See ya!
until they move in...
Mm. I'm in heaven.
get close.
it should either I'm still... hot.
and uncover what's behind closed doors.
I don't know about you, it's just too hot today, isn't it?
and it's going to get even worse. Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.
so, please, remember to cover up and stay cool...
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.
come on, guys, time to go home.
come on, love, off you get.
do we have to? - Yes, we do.
I'll make you your favorite dinner to compensate.
he squealed like a pig, didn't he?
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D. Did you see his face?
Hey, Big D.
beat up another 10-year-old?
this one deserved it. - Yeah.
five against one, very brave. - Well, you're one to talk.
moaning in your sleep every night? At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.
don't kill Cedric.
who's Cedric, your boyfriend?
shut up. - "He's going to kill me, Mum."
where is your mum?
where is your mum, Potter?
she dead?
is she dead?
is she a dead Pott...?
Dudley. - Dudley, let's go.
what's going on? - What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything. - We're getting out of here, Dudley.
come on, Dudley, hurry up.
dudley, run.
Expecto Patronum.
Mrs. Figg.
don't put away your wand, Harry.
they might come back.
dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next?
whole world's gone topsy-turvy. - I don't understand. How do you know...?
Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you.
Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore?
after You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year...
...did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own?
good Lord, boy. They told me you were intelligent.
now, get inside and stay there.
expect someone will be in touch soon. Whatever happens, don't leave the house.
it is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.
there's sweat. There's stifling.
Diddykins?
is that you?
duddy. Vernon, come quick.
we're going to have to take him to a hospital.
who did this to you, boy?
happy, are we, now?
you've finally done it. You've finally driven him loopy.
Vernon, don't say that.
well, just look at him, Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy.
I've reached my limit, do you hear?
this is the last I'm gonna take of you and your nonsense.
dear Mr. Potter. - What?
the Ministry has received intelligence that at 6: 23 this evening...
...you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle.
as a clear violation...
...of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery...
...you are hereby expelled...
...from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.
justice.
he's not very well.
sorry, Hedwig.
very clean, these Muggles.
Tonks, for God's sake. - Unnatural.
professor Moody.
what are you doing here? - Rescuing you, of course.
but where are we going? The letter said I've been expelled.
you haven't been. Not yet. Kingsley, you take point.
but the letter said...
Dumbledore persuaded the minister to suspend your expulsion...
...pending a formal hearing. - A hearing?
don't worry. We'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters.
not here, Nymphadora.
don't call me Nymphadora.
stay in formation, everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.
come on, you, around the corner.
come on.
in you go, son.
there've been no sightings.
no deaths. No proof.
he almost killed Harry. If that isn't proof enough...
Yes, but guarding you-know-what is the most important...
we must trust Dumbledore on this.
was he able to protect Harry last year? Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second.
his instinct would be to ignore it... - Keep your voices down.
he's getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now.
Harry. - Mrs. Weasley.
heavens, you're all right.
bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting's finished.
Nope. No time to explain. Straight upstairs, first door on the left.
Yeah.
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.
if my poor mistress knew the scum they let into her house...
...what would she say to old Kreacher?
Oh, the shame.
freaks. - There, there, mistress.
scum of the earth. Not like it was in the days of my fathers.
Kreacher is here.
Oh, Harry.
are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack.
you must tell us everything. - Let the man breathe, Hermione.
and this hearing at the Ministry. It's just outrageous.
I've looked it up. They simply can't expel you.
it's completely unfair. - Yeah.
there's a lot of that going round at the moment.
so, what is this place?
it's headquarters. - Of the Order of the Phoenix.
it's a secret society.
Dumbledore formed it back when they fought You-Know-Who.
couldn't have put any of this in a letter, I suppose?
I've gone all summer without a scrap of news.
we wanted to write, mate. Really, we did.
only... - Only what?
only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything.
Dumbledore said that?
but why would he keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help.
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...
...the one who fought him, who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.
Harry. - Thought we heard your dulcet tones.
don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out. - If you're all done shouting...
do you wanna hear something a little more interesting?
if anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for Harry...
...we wouldn't even know voldemort was back.
he's not a child, Molly.
but he's not an adult either.
he's not James, Sirius. - Well, he's not your son.
he's as good as.
who else has he got? - Hey, Ginny.
he's got me. - How touchingly paternal, Black.
perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather.
now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.
snape's part of the Order? - Git.
about your supposed reformation.
I know better. - So why don't you tell him?
get off it. - Quick.
get it up. - Crookshanks.
stop it. - Get off, you bloody cat.
Crookshanks. Leave it alone. - Get it up.
Hermione, I hate your cat. - Bad Crookshanks.
well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.
just because you're allowed to use magic now...
...does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything.
Hi, Mum.
you hungry, Harry?
you sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn.
Harry Potter.
Sirius.
this is very, very peculiar.
it seems your hearing in the Ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot.
I don't understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me?
show him. He'll find out soon enough.
he's been attacking Dumbledore as well.
fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet...
...to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned.
Why?
he thinks Dumbledore's after his job.
no one in their right mind could believe that...
exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind.
it's been twisted and warped by fear.
now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry.
the last time Voldemort gained power...
...he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear.
now he's returned, and I'm afraid the minister will do almost anything...
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.
we think Voldemort wants to build up his army again.
fourteen years ago, he had huge numbers at his command.
and not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures.
he's been recruiting heavily, and we've been attempting to do the same.
but gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in.
we believe...
...Voldemort may be after something.
Sirius.
something he didn't have last time.
you mean like a weapon?
no. That's enough. He's just a boy.
you say more and you might as well induct him into the Order.
good. I want to join. If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight.
Harry.
you are hereby expelled.
before the entire Wizengamot.
trains. Underground.
ingenious, these Muggles.
here we are.
I've never used the visitors' entrance before. Should be fun.
right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money.
terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market.
daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet?
dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous?
morning, Arthur. - Morning, Bob.
interdepartmental memos.
we used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable.
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.
they've changed the time of your hearing. - When is it?
in five minutes.
department of Mysteries.
and I'm confident, minister, that you will do the right thing.
Yes, but we must be...
remember, during the hearing, speak only when you're spoken to.
keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.
as the Muggles say, truth will out.
yes?
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.
good luck, Harry.
disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August...
...into offenses committed by Harry James Potter...
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag...
witness for the defense.
albus Percival Wulfric... ...Brian Dumbledore.
you got our message that the time and place of the hearing...
...had been changed, did you? - I must have missed it.
but by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.
the charges?
the charges against the accused are as follows:
that he did knowingly...
...and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions...
...produce a Patronus Charm...
...in the presence of a Muggle.
do you deny producing said Patronus? - No, but...
and you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school...
...while under the age of 17? - Yes, I was, but...
witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...
I was only doing it because of the Dementors.
dementors?
in Little Whinging?
that's quite clever.
muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy?
highly convenient. - I'm not lying.
there were two of them, and if I hadn't... - Enough.
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story...
...but since you can produce no witnesses of the event...
pardon me, minister, but as it happens, we can.
please describe the attack.
what did they look like?
well, one of them was very large and the other rather skinny.
not the boys. The Dementors.
Oh, right, right. Well, big.
cloaked. Then everything went cold...
...as though all the happiness had gone from the world.
now, look here. Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb...
...and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical.
I don't think anyone would believe...
...the Dementors were there by coincidence, minister.
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, professor.
dementors are, after all, under the control of the Ministry of Magic.
and it's so silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though...
...you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy.
that would be disturbing indeed, Madam Undersecretary...
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...
...into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban...
...and why they mounted an attack without authorization.
of course, there is someone...
...who might be behind the attack.
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.
the evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible.
he is not back.
in the matter of Harry Potter...
...the law clearly states...
...that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations.
laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore.
clearly. Has it become practice to hold a full criminal trial...
...to deal with a simple matter of underage magic?
those in favor of conviction?
those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?
cleared of all charges.
professor.
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?
you'll blow the entire operation.
Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you...
I had to see you off, didn't I?
what's life without a little risk?
I don't wanna see you get chucked back in Azkaban.
don't worry about me.
anyway, I wanted you to have this.
original Order of the Phoenix.
Marlene McKinnon.
she was killed two weeks after this was taken.
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.
Frank and Alice Longbottom.
Neville's parents.
they suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me.
it's been 14 years.
and still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad.
do you really think there's going to be a war, Sirius?
it feels like it did before.
you keep it.
anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now.
I'll see you at the train.
Bye-bye, darling.
I love you.
hold my hand, lovey.
there they are. They're in the far carriage.
Bye.
I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free.
better enjoy it while you can.
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it.
What'd I tell you? Complete nutter. - Just stay away from me!
it's only Malfoy.
What'd you expect?
Hi, guys.
Hey, Neville. - Hey there, Neville.
what is it?
what's what? - That. Pulling the carriage.
nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.
it's pulling itself, like always.
you're not going mad.
I can see them too.
you're just as sane as I am.
everyone, this is Loony Love...
Luna Lovegood.
what an interesting necklace.
it's a charm, actually.
keeps away the Nargles.
hungry.
I hope there's pudding.
what's a Nargle? - No idea.
good evening, children.
now, we have two changes in staffing this year.
we're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank...
...who'll be taking care of Magical Creatures...
...while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave.
we also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.
and I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the professor good luck.
now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you...
she was at my hearing. She works for Fudge.
thank you, headmaster, for those kind words of welcome.
and how lovely to see all your bright...
...happy faces smiling up at me.
I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends.
that's likely. - That's likely.
the Ministry of Magic has always considered...
...the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance.
although each headmaster...
...has brought something new to this historic school...
...progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged.
let us preserve what must be preserved...
...perfect what can be perfected...
...and prune practices that ought to be prohibited.
thank you, Professor Umbridge. That really was most illuminating.
Illuminating? What a load of waffle. - What's it mean?
magic is forbidden in the corridors...
it means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts.
Dean, Seamus.
good holiday? - All right.
better than Seamus', anyway.
me mum didn't want me to come back this year.
why not? - Let me see. Because of you.
the Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.
what, your mum believes them?
nobody was there the night Cedric died.
I guess you should read the Prophet, then, like your stupid mother.
don't talk about my mother. - I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.
what's going on? - He's mad, is what's going on.
do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who?
Yeah. I do.
has anyone else got a problem with Harry?
you all right? - Fine.
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.
but he'll come through, you'll see. - I said, I'm fine, Ron.
right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then.
Harry.
bring it over here. Over here.
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.
good morning, children.
ordinary Wizarding Level Examinations.
more commonly known as O.W.L.s.
study hard and you will be rewarded.
fail to do so, and the consequences may be severe.
your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven.
but you'll be pleased to know, from now on...
...you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved...
...course of defensive magic. Yes?
there's nothing in here about using defensive spells?
using spells?
well, I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom.
we're not gonna use magic?
you'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way.
what use is that? If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.
students will raise their hands when they speak in my class.
it is the view of the Ministry...
...that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient...
...to get you through your examinations...
...which, after all, is what school is all about.
and how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there?
there is nothing out there, dear.
who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.
now, let me make this quite plain.
you have been told...
...that a certain dark wizard is at large once again.
this is a lie. - It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.
detention, Mr. Potter.
Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord?
Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident.
it was murder. Voldemort killed him.
enough!
enough.
see me later, Mr. Potter. My office.
come in.
good evening, Mr. Potter.
sit.
you're going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter.
no, not with your quill.
going to be using a rather special one of mine.
now...
...I want you to write, "I must not tell lies."
how many times?
well, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in.
you haven't given me any ink.
Oh, you won't need any ink.
yes?
nothing. - That's right.
because you know, deep down...
...you deserve to be punished.
don't you, Mr. Potter?
go on.
skiving Snackboxes. - Sweets that make you ill.
get out of class whenever you like.
obtain hours of pleasure from unprofitable boredom.
care for another?
I'm not asking you to write all of it for me. - Please.
I've been busy studying for these stupid O.W.L. exams.
I'll do the introduction. That's all.
Hermione, you're honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met.
and if I'm ever rude to you again... - I'll know you've gone back to normal.
what's wrong with your hand?
nothing.
the other hand.
you've got to tell Dumbledore. - No.
Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now.
I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction.
bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you.
if the parents knew about this... - I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?
Harry, you've got to report this.
it's perfectly simple. You're being... - No, it's not.
Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple.
you don't understand.
then help us to.
dear Padfoot...
...I hope you're all right.
it's starting to get colder here. Winter is definitely on the way.
in spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever.
I know you, of all people, will understand.
Hello, Harry Potter.
your feet. Aren't they cold? - Bit.
unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared.
I suspect Nargles are behind it.
what are they? - They're called Thestrals.
they're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're a bit...
different.
but why can't the others see them?
they can only be seen by people who've seen death.
so you've known someone who's died, then?
my mum.
she was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment...
...and one day, one of her spells went badly wrong.
I was 9. - I'm sorry.
Yes, it was rather horrible.
I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I've got Dad.
we both believe you, by the way.
that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and you fought him...
...and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you.
Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do.
I don't think that's true.
but I suppose that's how he wants you to feel.
what do you mean?
well, if I were You-Know-Who...
...I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else...
...because if it's just you alone...
...you're not as much of a threat.
do you ever stop eating? - What? I'm hungry.
Harry.
can I join you?
pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating?
I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students...
...you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices.
so silly of me, but it sounds...
...as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom...
...Minerva.
not at all, Dolores, merely your medieval methods.
I am sorry, dear.
but to question my practices is to question the Ministry...
...and by extension, the minister himself.
I am a tolerant woman...
...but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty.
disloyalty.
things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared.
Cornelius will want to take immediate action.
what's happened to Dumbledore?
having already revolutionized...
...the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts...
...Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers...
...to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School.
just one question, dear.
you've been in this post how long, exactly?
you applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct?
Yes.
but you were unsuccessful?
obviously.
could you please predict something for me?
I'm sorry?
move those mouths.
one teensy little prophecy?
pity.
no, wait. Wait, no. I think I do see something.
Yes, I do. Something dark.
you are in grave danger.
lovely.
Cho. What's going on?
it's Professor Trelawney.
sixteen years I've lived and taught here.
Hogwarts is my home.
you can't do this.
actually, I can.
something you'd like to say?
Oh, there are several things I would like to say.
there...
professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside?
Sybil, dear. This way.
thank you.
Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms...
...of Educational Decree Number 23, as enacted by the minister...
you have the right to dismiss my teachers.
you do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds.
that power remains with the headmaster.
for now.
don't you all have studying to do?
professor.
professor?
professor Dumbledore. Professor!
professor Dumbledore.
that foul, evil, old gargoyle.
we're not learning how to defend ourselves. We're not learning how to pass our O.W.L.s.
she's taking over the entire school.
security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority.
furthermore, we have convincing evidence...
...that these disappearances are the work...
...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black.
Harry.
Sirius.
what are you doing here? - Answering your letter.
you said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing?
training you to kill half-breeds?
she's not letting us use magic at all. - Well, I'm not surprised.
the latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat.
combat?
what does he think, we're forming some sort of wizard army?
that's exactly what he thinks.
that Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry.
he's becoming more paranoid by the minute.
the others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry...
...but things aren't going at all well with the Order.
fudge is blocking the truth at every turn...
...and these disappearances are just how it started before.
Voldemort is on the move.
well, what can we do?
someone's coming.
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
but for now, at least, it looks like you're on your own.
he really is out there, isn't he?
we've got to be able to defend ourselves.
and if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will.
Harry.
this is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?
I'm a nutter, remember?
look on the bright side: You can't be any worse than old toad face.
Thanks, Ron. - I'm here for you, mate.
who's supposed to be meeting us, then?
just a couple of people.
lovely spot.
thought it would be safer off the beaten track.
matey, come back here.
Hi.
so you all know why we're here.
we need a teacher.
a proper teacher.
one who's had experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts.
Why? - Why?
because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot.
so he says. - So Dumbledore says.
so Dumbledore says because he says.
the point is, where's the proof?
if Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed...
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here, clear out now.
come on, Hermione. They're here because they think I'm some sort of freak.
is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?
Yes.
I've seen it.
blimey, Harry. I didn't know you could do that.
and he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office.
it's true.
third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once.
last year, he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh.
wait.
look, it all sounds great when you say it like that...
...but the truth is, most of that was just luck.
I didn't know what I was doing half the time. I nearly always had help.
he's just being modest. - No, Hermione, I'm not.
facing this stuff in real life is not like school.
in school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow.
but out there...
...when you're a second away from being murdered...
...or watching a friend die right before your eyes...
you don't know what that's like.
you're right, Harry, we don't.
that's why we need your help.
because if we're going to have any chance at beating...
...Voldemort...
he's really back.
right. First we need to find a place to practice... ...where Umbridge won't find out.
the Shrieking Shack. - It's too small.
forbidden Forest? - Not bloody likely.
Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out?
who cares?
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?
who are you and what have you done with Hermione?
anyway, at least we know one positive thing that came from today.
what's that?
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she?
right. Over the next few days, we should each come up...
...with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice.
we've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us.
will do, Harry.
all student organizations are henceforth disbanded.
any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
watch where you're going, Longbottom.
you've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement.
the what?
it's also known as the Come and Go Room.
the Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it.
and it's always equipped for the seeker's needs.
so say you really needed the toilet...
charming, Ronald. But, yes, that is the general idea.
it's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back.
Expelliarmus.
I'm hopeless.
you're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.
you will please copy the approved text four times...
...to ensure maximum retention.
there will be no need to talk. - No need to think's more like it.
Expelliarmus. - Wands away.
stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal.
it's a wizard's bread and butter, really.
so come on, then, Nigel. Give it your best shot.
Stupefy!
good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.
don't worry. I'll go easy on you.
Thanks, Ronald.
come on, Ron. - Come on, Ron.
you can do it. - Come on, Ron.
one Sickle. - You're on.
Stupefy.
thank you. - Shut up.
I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it?
it was completely intentional.
up you come. Would you like a cup of tea?
now, focus on a fixed point and try again.
Expelliarmus.
very good. Keep your concentration.
great.
a little higher.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Stupefy. - Stupefy.
those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
...may sign up in the high inquisitor's office.
diminuendo.
working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more:
believing in yourself.
Expelliarmus. - Levicorpus. Got it.
think of it this way.
every great wizard in history has started out...
...as nothing more than what we are now: Students.
if they can do it, why not us?
Stupefy. - Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Reducto.
Expelliarmus. - Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
Expelliarmus.
fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.
so that's it for this lesson.
now, we're not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays.
so just keep practicing on your own as best you can.
and well done, everyone. Great, great work.
well done, mate.
Thanks.
see you after Christmas.
see you in the Common Room, Harry.
thanks a lot, Harry. - No worries.
thank you so much. - Not at all. Merry Christmas.
thank you, Harry. - Thank you. Merry Christmas.
merry Christmas. - Have a good Christmas.
have a great Christmas, Luna. - We've been thinking.
we could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles.
or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus-filled boils...
sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me?
are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day.
Yeah. I'm okay.
anyway, it's worth it.
it's just, learning all this...
...makes me wonder whether, if he'd known it...
Cedric did know this stuff.
he was really good.
it's just, Voldemort was better.
you're a really good teacher, Harry.
I've never been able to stun anything before.
mistletoe.
probably full of Nargles, though.
what are Nargles?
no idea.
well, how was it?
wet.
I mean, she was sort of crying.
that bad at it, are you?
I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory.
Cho spends half her time crying these days.
you'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up.
don't you understand how she must be feeling?
well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric...
...and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him...
...conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry...
...and frightened of failing her O.W.L.s because she's worrying about everything.
one person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode.
just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon...
Harry.
Voldemort may be after something.
something he didn't have last time.
Harry.
Harry.
in the dream, were you standing next to the victim...
...or looking down at the scene?
neither. It was like I...
will you please just tell me what's happening?
everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.
make sure he's found by the right people.
sir. - Phineas.
you must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place.
tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured...
...and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey.
they've got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it.
what's more, the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...
look at me!
what's happening to me?
you wished to see me, headmaster?
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning.
otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.
it appears there's a connection...
...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own.
whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear.
pray he remains ignorant.
you mean, if he knows about it, then...
...he'll be able to read my mind? - Read it, control it...
...unhinge it.
in the past, it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure...
...to invade the minds of his victims...
...creating visions designed to torture them into madness.
only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony...
...only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally...
...kill them.
used properly, the power of Occlumency...
...will help shield you from access or influence.
in these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind.
you will attempt to resist.
prepare yourself.
Legilimens.
concentrate, Potter. Focus.
ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.
here we go.
daddy's back.
sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents.
and a nice big box for Ron. - Big box for you. And...
Fred and George. Come on, open up.
I want to see your faces. - Yes.
try it on. - Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.
just what he wanted, actually. - Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.
come on, then, everybody. Let's clear this away.
Oh, Harry, Harry.
there you are.
happy Christmas. - Thank you.
lovely to have you with us. - Thank you.
now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.
thank you. - Has everybody got?
Fred? George?
Hermione. - A Christmas toast.
to Mr. Harry Potter...
...without whom I would not be here.
Harry. - Harry.
Harry.
that is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that.
daddy, don't forget last Christmas.
I can't understand why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.
no more than usual, Ron.
I don't know why...
nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass.
Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.
friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike.
if my poor mistress only knew... - Kreacher!
that's enough of your bile. Away with you!
of course, master.
Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black.
sorry about that.
he never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy.
not to me, anyway.
what, you grew up here?
this is my parents' house.
I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order.
about the only useful thing I've been able to do.
this is the Black family tree.
my deranged cousin.
I hated the lot of them.
my parents with their pure-blood mania.
my mother did that after I ran away.
charming woman.
I was 16.
where did you go?
round your dad's.
I was always welcome at the Potters'.
I see him so much in you, Harry.
you are so very much alike.
I'm not so sure.
Sirius, when I was...
when I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching.
I was the snake.
and afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...
...there was a moment when I wanted to...
this connection between me and Voldemort.
what if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him?
I just feel so angry all the time.
and what if, after everything that I've been through...
...something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad?
I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry.
you're not a bad person.
you're a very good person who bad things have happened to.
you understand?
besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters.
we've all got both light and dark inside of us.
what matters is the part we choose to act on.
that's who we really are.
Harry, time to go.
when all this is over, we'll be a proper family.
you'll see.
come on.
Really?
Harry. Harry.
Hagrid's back.
I'm sorry.
I will say this one last time.
I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been.
I told you. I've been away for me health.
your health? - Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by.
if I were you, I shouldn't get too used to being back.
in fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all.
this is top-secret, right?
Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants.
giants?
you found them?
well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?
I tried to convince them to join the cause.
but I wasn't the only one that was trying to win them over.
death Eaters? - Yes.
trying to persuade them to join You-Know-Who.
did they? - I gave them Dumbledore's message.
suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose.
and they did this to you?
not exactly, no.
Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog.
it's changing out there.
just like last time.
there's a storm coming, Harry.
we'd all best be ready when she does.
we have confirmed that 10 high-security prisoners...
...in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape.
and of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger.
we strongly suspect...
...that the breakout was engineered...
...By a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban...
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.
Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen.
he's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth.
Harry.
I wanted to apologize.
now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up.
so, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you.
Neville?
fourteen years ago...
...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange...
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.
she tortured them for information...
...but they never gave in.
I'm quite proud to be their son.
but I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.
we're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise.
make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember.
allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus.
George, your turn now.
Expecto Patronum.
a full-bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce...
...but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents.
wow, that was really good.
fantastic, Ginny.
just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused.
so focus, Luna.
think of the happiest thing you can.
Expecto Patronum.
I'm trying. - I know. It's good.
this is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well.
Expecto Patronum.
I'll make short work of this.
Bombarda Maxima.
get them.
been watching them for weeks.
and see, "Dumbledore's Army..."
...proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius.
all your fear-mongering about You-Know-Who...
...never fooled us for a minute.
we saw your lies for what they were:
a smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry.
naturally.
no, professor. He had nothing to do with it. It was me.
most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out...
...the parchment clearly says "Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's.
I instructed Harry to form this organization.
and I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities.
dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.
if we hurry, we should still make the morning edition.
dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore...
...to Azkaban...
...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition.
I thought we might hit this little snag.
you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I'm going to...
what was the phrase?
come quietly.
well, I can tell you this:
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.
enough of this.
take him.
well, you may not like him, minister...
...but you can't deny...
...Dumbledore has got style.
boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other.
those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...
students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities.
any student in noncompliance will be expelled.
Harry.
you did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag.
even Dumbledore didn't see this coming.
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.
Yeah, we talked you into it.
Yeah, but I agreed.
I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is make things worse.
anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.
because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much.
and the more you care, the more you have to lose.
so maybe it's just better to... - To what?
to go it alone.
Hagrid.
any idea where he's taking us?
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.
and they're dangerous at the best of times.
the Ministry restricts their territory much more...
...they'll have a full uprising on their hands.
Hagrid, what's going on?
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone...
...I'll likely be getting the sack any day now.
and I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him.
Grawpy.
down here, you great buffoon.
Grawpy.
brought you some company.
I couldn't just leave him, because...
because he's my brother.
blimey.
well, half brother, really.
he's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high-spirited, is all.
Grawpy, that is not polite. - Hagrid, do something.
we talked about this. You do not grab, do you?
that's your new friend, Hermione.
Grawpy.
Grawp.
put me down.
now.
you all right?
fine.
just needs a firm hand, is all.
I think you've got an admirer.
you just stay away from her, all right?
he gets his own food and all.
it's company he'll be needing when I'm gone.
you will look after him, won't you?
I'm the only family he's got.
feeling sentimental?
that's private. - Not to me.
and not to the Dark Lord, if you don't improve.
every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you.
you won't last two seconds if he invades your mind.
you're just like your father.
lazy, arrogant.
don't say a word against my father. - Weak.
I'm not weak. - Then prove it.
control your emotions.
discipline your mind.
Legilimens.
Harry.
Sirius.
I may vomit.
stop it.
is this what you call control?
we've been at it for hours. If I could just rest.
the Dark Lord isn't resting.
you and Black, you're two of a kind.
sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been.
well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair.
your blessed father knew that. In fact, he frequently saw to it.
my father was a great man. - Your father was a swine.
Legilimens. - Protego.
come on, Moony, Padfoot.
Snape. Expelliarmus.
nice one, James.
dad. - Impedimenta.
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers?
Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy.
enough.
enough.
your lessons are at an end.
l...
get out.
what's your name? - Michael.
your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?
it's fading already.
you can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while.
as I told you once before, Mr. Potter...
...naughty children deserve to be punished.
you know, George...
...I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement.
Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing.
all right, professor!
here you go.
ready when you are.
I need that prophecy.
you'll have to kill me.
Oh, I will. But first, you will fetch it for me.
Crucio.
Crucio.
Sirius.
Harry, are you sure?
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.
it's the door I've been dreaming about.
I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before.
Sirius said Voldemort was after something.
something he didn't have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries.
Harry, please, just listen.
what if Voldemort meant for you to see this?
what if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you?
what if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die?
Hermione, he's the only family I've got left.
what do we do?
we'll have to use the Floo Network.
Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance.
not all of them.
Alohomora.
alert the Order if you can.
are you mental? We're going with you. - It's too dangerous.
when are you going to get it into your head? We're in this together.
that you are.
caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl.
you were going to Dumbledore, weren't you?
no. - Liar.
you sent for me, headmistress? - Snape, yes.
the time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me or not.
have you brought the Veritaserum?
I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students.
the last of it on Miss Chang.
unless you wish to poison him...
and I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did.
I cannot help you.
he's got Padfoot.
he's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden.
Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden?
what is he talking about, Snape?
no idea.
very well.
you give me no choice, Potter.
as this is an issue of Ministry security...
...you leave me with...
...no alternative.
the Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue.
that's illegal.
what Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him.
tell her, Harry!
tell me what?
well, if you won't tell her where it is...
...I will.
where what is?
Dumbledore's secret weapon.
how much further?
not far.
it had to be somewhere students wouldn't find it accidentally.
what are you doing?
Lmprovising.
well?
where is this weapon?
there isn't one, is there?
you were trying to trick me.
you know...
...I really hate children.
you have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter.
lower your weapons.
I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence...
Protego.
how dare you?
filthy half-breed.
Incarcerous.
please. Please stop it. Please.
now, enough. I will have order.
you filthy animal.
do you know who I am?
leave him alone. It's not his fault.
no, he doesn't understand.
Potter, do something. Tell them I mean no harm.
I'm sorry, professor.
but I must not tell lies.
what are you doing?
I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge.
let me go!
thank you, Grawp.
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.
how'd you get away? - Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.
told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets.
they told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves.
that was clever, Ron.
has been known to happen. - It was brilliant.
so how are we getting to London?
look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you...
...but I've got you into enough trouble as it is.
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real.
or was that all just words to you?
maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate.
so how are we going to get to London?
we fly, of course.
department of Mysteries.
this is it.
he should be here. - Harry.
it's got your name on it.
the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.
and the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal...
...but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not.
for neither can live while the other survives.
Harry.
Where's Sirius?
you know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams...
...and reality.
you saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see.
now, hand me the prophecy.
if you do anything to us, I'll break it.
he knows how to play.
itty, bitty baby.
Potter.
Bellatrix Lestrange.
Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad?
better, now they're about to be avenged.
now, let's everybody just calm down...
...shall we?
all we want is that prophecy.
why did Voldemort need me to come and get this?
you dare speak his name?
you filthy half-blood!
it's all right. He's just a curious lad, aren't you?
prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made.
which is lucky for you, really.
haven't you always wondered...
...what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord?
why he was unable to kill you...
...when you were just an infant?
don't you want to know the secret of your scar?
all the answers are there, Potter, in your hand.
all you have to do...
...is give it to me.
then I can show you everything.
I've waited 14 years.
I know.
I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Levicorpus.
Petrificus Totalus.
well done, Neville.
Stupefy.
Stupefy. - Stupefy.
Stupefy.
Reducto.
get back to the door.
department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn't they?
the voices.
can you tell what they're saying?
there aren't any voices, Harry.
let's get out of here.
I hear them too.
Harry, it's just an empty archway.
please, Harry.
get behind me.
did you actually believe...
...or were you truly naive enough to think...
...that children stood a chance against us?
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.
give me the prophecy now...
...or watch your friends die.
don't give it to him, Harry.
get away from my godson.
now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here.
what? No, I'm staying with you.
you've done beautifully.
now, let me take it from here.
black.
Expelliarmus!
nice one, James.
Avada Kedavra.
no. No.
I killed Sirius Black.
you coming to get me? - Crucio.
you've got to mean it, Harry.
she killed him. She deserves it.
you know the spell, Harry.
do it.
so weak.
it was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom.
the Aurors are on their way.
by which time I shall be gone, and you...
...shall be dead.
you've lost, old man.
Harry.
so weak.
so vulnerable.
look at me.
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.
it's how you are not.
Harry?
you're the weak one...
...and you'll never know love or friendship.
and I feel sorry for you.
you're a fool, Harry Potter.
and you will lose everything.
he's back.
I know how you feel, Harry.
no, you don't.
it's my fault.
no, the fault is mine.
I knew it was only a matter of time...
...before Voldemort made the connection between you.
I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year...
...He'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected.
the prophecy said:
neither one can live while the other one survives.
it means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.
Yes.
why didn't you tell me?
for the same reason you tried to save Sirius.
the same reason your friends saved you.
after all these years, after all you've suffered...
...I didn't want to cause you any more pain.
I cared too much about you.
how come you're not at the feast?
lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them.
that's awful.
Oh, it's all good fun.
but as it's the last night, I really do need them back.
do you want any help finding them?
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.
are you sure you don't want any help looking?
that's all right.
anyway, my mum always said...
...the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end.
if not always in the way we expect.
think I'll just go have some pudding.
I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me.
what's that?
that even though we've got a fight ahead of us...
...we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have.
yeah?
something worth fighting for.
and I've come home to Harper's Island.
my best friend is getting married to the girl of his dreams.
but not everything about this trip is a celebration.
seven years ago, I left this place after John Wakefield murdered six people.
my mother was one of them.
everyone else has moved on...
believes the killings are in the past.
but I can't help feel...
... there's more to come.
we gotta get this carcass cleaned up, so you can have your wedding rehearsal.
you're going to get in trouble. - Nobody cares what I do.
you think this will get you noticed?
only one way to find out.
we're done.
I don't wanna see you again.
my instincts have gotten me where I am today.
you married Katherine.
she's cheating on you with Richard.
good afternoon, everybody. I will be conducting the rehearsal.
and now Mr. Wellington will come up and light the unity candle.
can someone get the lights? - I... I got it.
you okay? Are you hurt?
look at me!
what happened?
it's gonna be okay.
wait for me outside, all right?
listen to me, people.
I need you to step outside now.
do not leave the premises, but go outside now.
Henry, take her outside. - Trish, we have to go.
we have to go, honey.
come on.
honey, we gotta go.
all right, listen up, folks. I'm very sorry for your loss.
I know you all have a lot of questions, and I'm gonna work very hard to answer them, but right now, it's very important that you get back to the Candlewick.
if you will help make sure everyone gets back there and stays put,
I'd appreciate it. I'd recommend you all stay together.
this is no time for anyone to be off on their own.
I will be back there to talk to you as soon as I can.
but what the hell was that thing? - I don't know.
a sword, maybe.
is there any chance it could have been a part of the chandelier?
you mean like an accident? - No way.
you see what it did to Trish's dad? Somebody did that on purpose.
dude, that could have been any one of us under that.
I've never seen a dead body before.
I have. - Dude!
it's gonna be okay. - How is it gonna be okay?
Mr. Wellington is dead. Trish is never gonna...
I just wanna go home.
so, I guess the wedding is...
they'll...
probably postpone it or something.
I bet we'll all be on a boat in the morning. - No, if someone did that on purpose...
we should leave here right now.
damn jacket contaminated the crime scene.
to tell you the truth, I'm glad it's there.
I'm in no hurry to see what's under it.
not after finding those pieces of Reverend Fain in the lake like that.
Lord, not another one.
I think this explains why the reverend was killed.
whoever did this probably killed the reverend 'cause he needed the church empty.
this took a long time to set up.
make sure you try and pull prints off of everything.
and I want lots of pictures, too.
we got another killer on this island.
I can tell that. - You know what I mean.
the reverend hacked to pieces, this man nearly split in half.
don't pretend that you don't recognize that weapon.
this has John Wakefield written all over it.
Wakefield is dead.
well, then, somebody is doing one hell of a job imitating him.
guy knew what he was doing.
looks like he rigged a trip wire to the light switch.
flick the switch and... - Fire the head spade.
pretty fancy way to kill somebody.
fancy or random? Could have hit anybody.
the lights were turned off when the unity candles were lit.
you think that the killer knew this?
and who stood where.
somebody wanted Thomas Wellington dead.
here, honey.
this always makes you feel better.
just wanted to see...
I'll be right back.
how's Trish?
she hasn't said a word since we got back.
I don't know what to do.
you don't have to do anything.
just be there.
just everything about this day...
this afternoon, before the rehearsal, JD and I got into a fight.
I told him to leave.
he just smiled and said he had one last "surprise" for me.
you think he did that to Trish's dad?
I was supposed to be getting married.
I'm scared.
I did say we might be becalmed.
Becalmed? - Stranded.
without wind. It's a sailing term.
I thought it meant "relaxed.
if I'd known it would cause you to be late, - I'd never have suggested the voyage. - It's just a rehearsal, it's fine.
I had a lovely time.
we just need to call Trish and tell her we're on our way.
I'll find the pay phone. You just becalm yourself right here.
to love and to destiny.
to love and to destiny!
yo, Earl Grey.
what's going on? Can I get you a drink?
what's the excitement?
crazy story.
you see that couple? Brett and Lisa... they've been on and off for years.
I mean, they fight, break up, get back together.
then, this morning, they were just walking along the beach, and Brett found a diamond ring in the sand.
he took it as a sign, proposed on the spot, and Lisa said yes.
they found a ring?
that's my ring.
it's okay, it's just me.
it's just me. - You broke into my room?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I needed to talk.
does Henry think I killed Wellington?
nobody knows what to think. - This is bad.
it was just a Roman candle firecracker.
my surprise... This thing I told Henry.
I put a Roman candle in the unity candle.
I thought it'd be funny just to piss Henry off.
I need your help.
remember what you said to Shane when he had me tied up, about John Wakefield being alive?
I made that up, trying to help you.
what if you were right?
what if he is alive? - He's not. It was a story.
I think I saw him.
today, outside of the church. - That's impossible. My dad killed him.
look, I know it sounds crazy.
but then I found something.
I can show you.
I didn't kill Wellington.
I'm afraid that no one else is gonna believe me.
please?
look, I need your help.
the sheriff's on his way over to talk to us.
does he know anything?
I'm not sure, but...
before he gets here, let's all just...
take a deep breath.
okay, we're all upset.
but no matter what happens, let's not forget we have each other.
we are a family and we will get through this.
no, we won't.
it may not seem like that right now. - Shut up, Richard.
not... another word.
Madison's trying to sleep.
you lying, cheating son of a bitch!
daddy knew, he knew you betrayed him.
what is she talking about?
he's cheating on you.
with her.
excuse me.
I have some questions to ask about what happened this afternoon.
maybe I should start with you.
it was like the universe was telling me to fish or cut bait.
got down on one knee. It was amazing.
afternoon.
Cal Vandeusen. - How you doing?
I heard the good news.
FELICITATIONS.
there's no easy way to say this, so I'll just...
jump right in.
the ring you found belongs to me.
I lost it a few days ago on the beach.
I sense your skepticism.
prove it," you may say. "Gladly," I retort.
first of all, the diamond is 1. 5 karats.
second, the...
color rating is an "H," which, you might not know, means it's virtually colorless, and, finally, the clarity rating is a VVS1.
it's an impressive statistic that any jeweler could verify, so...
I'm not getting my ring back, am I?
what the hell was that?
Trish, it's Chloe.
I guess I'll try back later.
I got her voice mail again.
what's the matter, sweetie?
you remember our first night here, when you threw my trousers in the ocean?
we've talked about that. - True. However...
when we discussed it, I left out the niggling detail...
that there was a ring in the pocket, that got washed away.
a ring?
for me?
like... the kind of ring you would give someone when you're gonna ask them to ma...
Really?
that is so romantic!
evidently, they agree.
that... dude found the ring and...
proposed then and there.
with the ring you were gonna give me?
I don't think so.
you need to tell me where we're going.
I saw a guy who looked like Wakefield outside the church.
I followed him. I have proof.
come on, he's right up here.
I'll show you.
it's here.
there.
Oh, my God.
is it...?
don't.
I need to see who this was with somebody I could trust.
this doesn't prove anything.
Oh, God, it's Uncle Marty.
Madison's asleep.
I am so...
sorry.
that is not how I wanted you to find out.
I always thought our marriage was a rock.
I mean, I actually thought that he loved me.
so you had no idea?
that's the frightening part.
we had fun together.
great sex.
it's like learning I've been married to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
please tell me Daddy didn't know.
I told Daddy this morning.
so his last day on Earth, he finds out his wife is cheating on him with his daughter's husband.
it's too horrible to think about.
and Daddy was so good to Richard, so generous.
thomas Wellington was a...
difficult man.
you worked for him, what...?
nearly 13 years.
been married to Shea for 12.
how long have you been involved with Katherine Wellington?
six weeks.
it just kind of happened.
fell on her, did you?
I knew what I was doing.
I know it sounds awful, but it was my way of...
getting back at Wellington.
for what?
you'd have to work for him...
to understand.
try me.
I hated him, if that's what you're asking.
his wife feel the same way?
you'd have to ask her yourself.
we don't talk much.
I just...
wanted to humiliate him.
I didn't kill him.
with my daughter Madison.
we spent the day together.
do you know anything about what happened here seven years ago?
the Wakefield murders?
that's right.
just the basics.
guy went on a rampage, killed a bunch of people.
Why?
thanks for talking to me.
appreciate the candor.
where have you been?
what's wrong? - God, Henry.
it's Uncle Marty.
what about him?
I saw him, Henry.
he's dead.
I'm... I'm so sorry.
show me. - No.
show me, I want to see it. I need to know what's happening.
I think Wakefield's back. That's what's happening.
jd was the one who found Uncle Marty.
you did this!
stop it!
you did this! - Henry, please.
stop it!
get off him! Both of you!
you always hated him!
I knew he wouldn't believe me. - Henry, he was as surprised as me.
uncle Marty was strung up in a tree.
it was awful.
it has to be Wakefield.
or a copycat.
there's something you need to see.
how could you?
after everything that I've done for you, this is how you repay me?
Oh, Chloe, "I love you.
Oh, Chloe, you're the only one who makes me feel like a man.
well, you're a liar and a cheat!
who are you? - Who are you, you son of a bitch!
and just so you know...
it isyour baby.
you bastard!
Hey, it's me again, Lucy.
can you call me? I just need to hear your voice and know you're okay.
or a text message or something, okay?
Lucy's, back in Seattle, right, with some dude?
that's what everyone keeps saying, but nobody seems to know for sure.
I left her, like, five messages.
maybe she's having a great time.
you know, with... with that guy. I mean...
love can do that.
I hope so.
you guys heard from Booth yet?
Yeah, he... he had to go home.
he's so lucky not to be here for this.
I hate this island.
and after breakfast? - Dad and I went to the pool.
I wore my blue bathing suit 'cause my green one was still wet.
you like to swim? - Yeah.
but Daddy burns easy, so we couldn't stay long.
and then what?
then, we went to the rec room and played Ping-Pong - until it was time to get ready. - That's a lot of Ping-Pong.
I'm very good.
I can see that.
well, thank you, Madison.
ladies.
honey, are you okay? Do you want to lie down for a little while?
no, thank you... I'm not sleepy.
did I do good? Will Daddy be proud of me?
Why? What do you mean?
I told the sheriff exactly what Daddy told me to say.
does your dad know you've been up here?
I don't understand.
it's like a shrine.
why does he have these?
I don't think my dad believed that Kelly killed herself.
I don't either. I'm telling you, it was Wakefield. He's doing all of this.
no, I think my dad's been tracking a Wakefield copycat for years.
wouldn't it be easier just to ask him?
there have been no murders on this island for seven years.
meanwhile, he's tracking deaths all over the Pacific Northwest that remind him of Wakefield.
so, he's obsessed.
you can't really blame him.
but now there are Wakefield-style murders here on the island.
you're saying, whoever did these... - Also killed Uncle Marty and Mr. Wellington.
but why now?
why, after all these years?
okay, that's creepy.
what was he lying about?
check this out.
points OF SIMILARITY 96. 3% PROBABILITY WAKEFIELD 6/29/06
this is impossible. - This is from the summer.
what if my dad's not tracking a copycat?
what if he's tracking Wakefield?
you're sure... no boats have left?
well, tell the harbormaster...
keep an eye out. Anybody comes or goes, I want to know.
there's another body, Dad.
it's my Uncle Marty.
where? - The woods off of East Road.
I'll get right on it. I'll send a deputy out there now.
he was cut in two, hanging in a tree.
sound familiar?
what's your point, JD? - His point is, my uncle might still be breathing if you'd have told us Wakefield was alive.
and so would Kelly Seaver. - John Wakefield is dead.
I shot and killed him seven years ago. You know that.
you went into my...
there's a copycat.
I thought that man might be him.
I don't believe you.
there's a way to find out the truth. - What are you talking about?
if Wakefield is dead and buried, we can prove it.
we'll dig him up. - We're not digging up anybody.
this day's hard enough without this kind of behavior.
Yeah, you'd like that. But I think Wakefield is still alive.
I bet, if I dug up that grave, I'd find an empty box.
should we find out once and for all who the real liar around here is?
I've heard enough from you.
you should have never left the hotel in the first place, let alone pry into my office.
I'm digging up Wakefield...
with or without your permission.
I'm sorry, JD. There's too much at stake here to let you interfere with my investigation. You two, get inside.
consider it a time out.
was it worth it, Sheriff?
pretending that Wakefield was dead so that you could be a hero?
where were you this morning, JD, when that contraption was set up that killed Mr. Wellington?
odd coincidence, isn't it?
you finding your uncle hanging, just like Kelly Seaver?
you being the last one to see her and all.
I liked Kelly.
you're locking up the wrong guy. Wakefield's still out there!
dad, I need to know the truth.
I'm getting you off this island tomorrow.
it's open.
I wasn't expecting you.
I saw your face...
after my father...
I could tell that you were upset.
what do you want?
I loved your father.
I have done some foolish things, but I wouldn't kill him.
then why did Richard lie about where he was this morning?
I don't know.
he told Madison to lie to the sheriff, say that he was with her.
well, he wasn't with me, if that's what you're asking.
well, then, where was he?
my dad's lying about Wakefield.
I can feel it.
I know.
did you see how he reacted when JD talked about digging up the grave?
John Wakefield murdered my mother, ruined my life.
if my dad's been lying all these years, if he didn't kill Wakefield, I need to know.
the grave.
that's the only way.
... you tell me, all right... because that was amazing.
well, I do get away with a lot of things. - Yeah...
thank God you're okay.
why wouldn't I be okay?
that's dreadful.
sounds like it could have been any of you.
that's what I said.
are you sure it was a head spade?
Oh, here we go. - That's not why I asked.
remember on the scavenger hunt?
there was a head spade missing from the Maritime Museum.
God, this is terrible.
the sheriff doesn't want anyone leaving until he talks to us all.
nobody's going anywhere.
does he suspect someone in the wedding party?
well, Maybe keeping us all cooped up here isn't just for our protection.
I never thought of it like that.
well, I'm not sleeping tonight.
richard would fantasize about it...
thomas dying.
how he would...
take over the company and run it like it should be run.
any specific threats?
no, just...
jokes.
he didn't really mean it. - Can you just show him the articles that you found?
richard left his briefcase in my room yesterday.
it's where he keeps the things we use.
I found these inside.
did Richard talk much about John Wakefield?
never.
that's why I didn't think anything of it until today.
thank you, Mrs. Wellington.
he used Wakefield as a cover to kill my father, didn't he?
I don't know, and until I do, I need you to remain calm and to keep this to yourself.
both of you.
how'd you know I was in here? - I hear things.
can I try?
how'd you get the key?
Maggie keeps it in a drawer.
nobody pays attention to kids.
some people think my dad killed my grandpa.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I...I'll see you later. - You promise?
I expected to find JD here.
didn't think I'd see you two.
I thought you locked him up. - Somebody let him out.
I'm sorry, Dad.
but I need to know if there's a body in there.
I won't stop you.
I've thought there was a Wakefield copycat for years. Just...
never imagined he'd come to the island.
could that be who JD saw outside the church?
maybe... or he didn't see anybody.
that could have been a lie.
then why come to me? Why take me to see Uncle Marty?
so he'd look innocent.
I don't know...
well, whoever's committing these murders...
I think they're pretending to be Wakefield to hide their true motive.
I'm sorry I went through your things.
your mother was a snoop.
runs in the blood.
I shouldn't have doubted you.
I gave you a lot of reason.
I sent you away after your mother died, and I know that hurt you... a lot.
but you have to understand that...
it wasn't because I didn't want you there.
it was because I didn't want you to see me like that broken weak.
don't you think I was feeling the same way?
and those things I said to you back then...
about your mother, that was in a moment of anger.
will you forgive me?
thank you.
well, we need to finish up here and then...
we'll get you two back to the Candlewick and then, tomorrow...
we'll send you all home.
what about JD? - I'm sorry, Henry, but...
I'm going to have to bring him in.
can you come in here, please?
What'd you do with the ring?
the ring.
not to worry, it's safe and sound.
it's so romantic
that couple finding it on the beach and proposing on the spot like that.
becalm yourself, my dear.
I know you want me to be more impetuous.
about that...
I'm sorry I've been so critical.
I think you scare me sometimes
that you care enough to think of everything.
it's because I adore you.
but the ring...
is actually the one thing I hadn't thought through.
I don't want to disappoint you, but I'm not going to propose to you on the same day Trish lost her father.
but you are going to?
of course I am.
I'm crazy for you.
just not today.
I have not been charged with anything, but I am not saying another word without you present.
the sheriff is going to be coming back and I will refer him to your office.
more importantly, I don't know what Shea is going to do.
she's pretty pissed.
no, I don't care about the money.
but I want you to fight for shared...
Yeah, mine too. He never wants to see me.
where does that leave you?
at the crazy house of the even crazier Finch.
do you think he's crazy?
in a good way. I think he's a genius.
like when I was your age and I'd have a rage seizure, he'd put on music to lower my blood pressure.
NAT King Cole, Stardust, revolutionary sort of stuff, you know?
worked every time.
if he hadn't adopted me, shit, I don't know what I would've done.
well, here she is.
but couldn't you have just been his patient?
I mean, I don't understand why he had to adopt you.
well, Finch believes that a person becomes an adult at 13.
at that age, no adult can tell them what to do.
and they can choose their own parents. I did it.
Natalie did it.
Natalie?
Natalie never mentioned that to me.
Oh, really?
ask her about Terrence Maxwell.
you're over 13, right?
Finchy saved my life, that's for sure.
he was the first person I told I was gay.
I'm gay too.
holy Mary, Mother of God, so that's what this is about. You're gay?
Yeah.
I thought Natalie had told you.
small world, right?
you, me.
crazy.
smoke?
here, let me light you.
want a ride home?
please.
I won't go fast.
maybe.
what just happened?
you think you're gay, right?
that's what gay men do.
just wanted you to know what you're in for.
want a beer? Smoke?
no.
journal, what can I say? He drove a cool car.
and it sure beat another crazy dinner at the Finch house.
there's a first time for everything, right?
I took those. In New York.
they're not very good.
I'm not very good at anything.
I'm not very good at anything.
I'm not very good at anything. I'm not very good at anything.
shut up.
what?
nothing.
one positive thing has come out of this.
nobody can ever say again that I'm afraid of trying new things.
come on, get dressed. I have to drive you back to Finch's.
I wanna go to my mom's.
you okay with what happened?
Yeah, sure.
well...
thanks for everything.
thank you.
thank you for everything.
Oh, Fern. Fern. Fern...
no, Fern, it's okay.
no, no, no, it's okay.
Augusten. Augusten.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Oh, God. God.
I wish you enjoyed school more.
although I guess it must be very dull compared to your life with me.
would you hand me my cover-up? I'm chilly.
watch it, Augusten!
I've got a lit cigarette in my hand.
don't act out in anger.
if you're upset by this, talk to me about it.
how could I not have known?
how long has this been happening?
I've been in love with Fern for a very long time.
our relationship became physical a number of weeks ago.
the intimate details are between me and Fern.
journal, I'm confused. How can my mother be with Fern?
fern drives a Chevy Nova.
I worry about you so.
I worry about you in school.
the law says you have to go. - Well, fuck that!
Augusten, please don't smoke my cigarettes.
you have a pack of your own.
although I wish you wouldn't smoke. - Well, I do.
all my life I've been oppressed, Augusten.
and all my life I've worked hard to fight that oppression.
when I was a little girl living in Cairo, Georgia,
I had a black nanny named Elsa who lived in a shack on the other side of town.
and in those days black people were called niggers.
and I knew that word "nigger" was a dirty word.
and I knew it was a word filled with hatred and anger.
I knew Elsa was no nigger. I knew it was wrong.
it's taken me all my life to claim myself as an artist and to claim myself as a woman.
I have struggled against the oppression of my mother and the oppression of your father, and for the first time in my life I feel I am truly able to claim myself.
and so, Augusten, I hope I have your support in my relationship with Fern because at this stage in my life I do not need and I will not accept more oppression.
I have spent my entire life fighting oppression.
I hope I don't have to fight you too.
can I have $5?
may I have $5?
Why?
so I can skip school tomorrow and go to the movies.
go get my pocketbook. I'll take a look.
do you like my new house?
I need high ceilings.
so, you've been spending a lot of time at the Finches' house.
are there other options I'm not aware of?
what is this?
adoption papers.
Dr. Finch has agreed to become your legal guardian.
what?
after discussing this with the doctor, we both feel this really is the best option.
he and his family can give you the attention you need.
you're giving me away to your shrink?
no.
I'm doing what's best for you. What's best for us.
I love you very, very much.
I will always be your parent. And you will always be my child.
and my fucking father won't even give me money for food.
he won't take my calls.
Yeah. He's basically worthless.
just like my mom.
just like the fucking nuns who beat me.
God.
sometimes I feel like just taking a butcher knife and just stabbing them both.
I understand.
you're the only one who does.
how close are you to Bookman, Augusten?
it started out as just friends, and now it's more than that.
this is a sexual relationship?
Bookman isn't a stable man.
his problems run very, very deep.
he seems okay.
well, I'm not saying you can't see him.
after all, as you say, you are already involved.
but I just want you to keep me abreast of the situation.
fine.
now, would you like some of these?
what are they?
well, I just got some samples in the mail, so I don't know.
so let me see.
this is mild anti-anxiety medication which might help you feel a little calmer...
I'm calm.
...when I tell you you have to go to school.
I go to school. - I'm on to your clever tricks, son.
I know you stay until homeroom, when they do attendance, and then you skip out.
I know when you've been naughty.
what are you, Santa Claus?
if by that you're asking am I the great patriarch, the father-giver, who fulfills wishes and challenges dreams and brings merriment to those who are suffering, well, then yes, Augusten, I am Santa Claus.
I'm not going!
you're in junior high, for Christ's sake. It can't be that bad.
I don't fit in.
where would we be without our painful childhoods?
well, the only loophole, or way I can see of getting you out of school for any considerable length of time, would be for you to commit suicide.
you want me to kill myself? - Well, if you try to kill yourself,
I could explain to the school board that you are psychologically unfit to attend, and that you needed intensive treatment.
it would be a staged suicide attempt.
of course, your poor mother would have to find you and drive you to the hospital, where you would stay for three weeks, or a month, for observation.
I don't know, it doesn't... I don't...
where is your spirit of adventure?
Augusten, stay with us!
you're in a hospital. We gotta get these pills out of your stomach.
Oh, God, Augusten, wake up!
don't you die on me! Wake up! Augusten!
wake up! Wake up!
please, stop! Please!
no, please!
I can't breathe.
no, get away from me! Get away!
the lady at the store said it has illustrations of all the procedures that cosmetology students have to master before they earn their license.
cold waves. Those are really hard.
well, now you can learn how to do them.
it's good to have a dream, Augusten.
dreams get you through the hard times.
what's your dream?
me?
I was never fancy enough to have one of those.
I was always too busy.
working.
well, so the doctor could go to school and...
no.
then the kids came and...
raising a family keeps you on the run and...
maybe that was your dream.
to have a family.
Yes.
that was a dream.
it's a good one to have.
Hello?
Fern, it's me.
why can't we do it?
get out.
I miss you.
I miss the smell of you.
who is it?
I'm not interested in what you're selling.
please don't call here again.
shit!
shit! It's all shit!
I'm digging this new look. I think you look much better.
Oh, my fucking hair! Oh, my God!
that was funny.
you should be laughing.
you know what, Augusten?
I'm not gonna throw you a pity party.
so fucking just get over yourself.
fuck you, Natalie. You don't know what it's like to be sent away.
you're right, I don't.
and you don't know what it's like to have a boyfriend that's just using you!
lucky me.
who's Terrence Maxwell, Natalie?
I've never heard of him.
tell me who he is.
tell me who he is. - Shut up.
it kills you, doesn't it? - Shut up.
let it out! - Shut up.
tell me who he is, Natalie! - Shut up.
tell me so I don't feel so alone!
he was the only one I ever loved and he doesn't want me anymore!
do you feel better?
a little bit.
how'd you meet him?
Terrence started seeing my dad after his mom died.
she left him everything.
he was 41 when I was 13.
he told me I was pretty.
and he made me believe it.
one day he broke my collar bone and I had to hitchhike to the emergency room, and I passed out on the side of the road and somebody found me.
my dad told him that he would press charges and that he would go to jail, unless he donated money to my college fund.
and he did.
75000
that's so great.
so, if you just apply... - My dad spent it.
every penny.
so that the IRS wouldn't take this house.
so I do know what it's like, Augusten, to love somebody who doesn't deserve it.
because they're all you have.
God, I hate my life.
I hate this kitchen.
I need high ceilings.
me too.
let's get rid of it, then.
let's take down the ceiling.
Deirdre, I need to talk to you.
I'm a fuckup and it's your fault!
that's right, Neil, blame your father for your inability to focus.
direct all that rage at me if it makes you feel better.
I can't focus because of the voices!
I see you for what you are.
yeah? Camera never lies, see?
my parents have given you thousands of dollars and I'm still sick!
you haven't helped me get better! You know what I do!
and you haven't helped me get better!
Deirdre?
did you hear me?
Hello, Agnes.
why am I here?
well, you have an appointment. Your regular 2: 00.
Yes. Why are you here?
because I want you to stop seeing my husband.
you're right, Neil, you're right. I've done nothing, apparently.
I've never pulled any strings, gotten you a scholarship to the University of Rochester to pursue your photographic interests. Absolutely nothing.
you just wanted to get rid of me.
I don't wanna get rid of Augusten. He's part of the family now.
it's just you. I just need you to go.
but then I'd miss my therapy. I need Dr. Finch.
no, I need Dr. Finch!
I'm not as pretty as you and I don't have your talent.
all I have is this family. And this family doesn't work without him.
why won't you let me live in the house and be a part of this family?
because I am the patriarch, and when the patriarch says jump, you jump, God damn it!
you don't cooperate, Neil, and for that you're punished.
that's not why you won't let me live in this house.
you won't let me 'cause you're afraid of me, aren't you?
of what I could do to you in the middle of the night while you're sleeping?
you're afraid of my anger, aren't you, Doctor?
our time is up, Neil.
I believe we've made a breakthrough today.
Really?
I am to see the doctor now.
Hello, Neil.
Hello, Mrs. Burroughs, you look wonderful.
Oh, thank you. How's my son?
he's just great.
will you be kind to him? - I will.
that's why I'm blocked, Dr. Finch, I'm sure of it.
you're not blocked because of Fern, Deirdre.
you're constipated creatively because of the rage you are not expressing.
scream, Deirdre, scream. Express the pain.
fern has ceased to be a suitable companion, Deirdre.
you need someone who worships you, who will feed your talent.
I have just the candidate.
Deirdre, I'd like to introduce you to Dorothy Ambrose, my 3: 00.
Dorothy is creative like you. She paints her fingernails to match her mood.
what color are we today, Dorothy?
shell pink. I've had a nice day.
Dorothy has a trust fund.
it was established by her father after he showed her his penis in a rowboat.
I've always wanted a daughter.
the ceiling was crushing us.
so we made a skylight.
I think it brings a much-needed sense of humor to the kitchen.
Vienna sausage. I've been looking for these.
I'll get it.
don't touch my sausage.
Dr. Finch? - Yes.
michael Shephard, IRS.
where will I treat the people who need me?
how will I provide for my family?
you got an extension, Dad.
six weeks. After six weeks they take the house.
we'll pray. God will help us.
and when God turns a deaf ear we can all just live in the car, because at least that's paid for.
you are a terrible daughter.
well, fuck you, kiss-ass.
just remember,
daddy's like a great ocean liner.
if he goes down, he's taking a lot of people with him.
stop.
damn it, Bookman! - What?
something's not right.
it's your hair. It lacks proper body.
that's because you've been pulling at it for two hours.
well, I wouldn't have to pull at it if it wasn't so naturally hideous.
I'm not complaining. I love it.
I love everything you touch.
maybe you could work on my mustache.
no, this is useless. Natalie, come here, let me try on you.
no, no. Fuck that. Forget it. I am through being your guinea pig.
look, my hair's coming out in fistfuls.
stop scratching at it.
you look like you have Down syndrome.
hope.
well, look, one of you is gonna have to help me, okay?
I don't get into beauty school unless I master the cold wave.
guess you're stuck with me, jocko.
being in love is fantastic, Hope. You should try it.
I'd hardly call you an expert.
are you saying my relationship with Augusten isn't real love?
I'm saying your relationship with Augusten is not mature love, no.
bullshit!
Neil, if you're not man enough to handle the truth, then maybe you should not be with a child.
I'm not a child, Hope.
you're right, Augusten, you're not. I'm sorry, you're very mature.
it's just that I was speaking of the love you have when you're older. Mature love.
and what do you, Miss Iceberg, know about mature love?
when was the last time you had anything in your twat besides a tampon?
that is the fucking truth.
all right, Bookman, that's enough!
I'm certainly not gonna listen to you when you're talking like a teenage boy!
what's in this? I'm starving.
Oh, this and that. My secret ingredient.
would you like to try?
what's the secret ingredient?
Freud.
freud's dead, Hope. You buried her.
I heard her calling me. She wanted me to dig her up.
she asked to be reincarnated as a stew.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
you fucking lunatic! I knew you were insane!
I don't eat pussy. Psycho.
come on, Augusten, let's go.
I want my beads back, hope.
I was just kidding, you jerks!
got some of my anger out.
today, we are going to explore sense memory.
I'd like everybody to take their blade of grass and stroke their cheeks with their eyes closed.
other senses are heightened when the eyes are closed.
it's very soothing, isn't it?
all right.
Neil, I believe you have a poem you'd like to read today.
Yes.
Deirdre, I'm not sure I feel comfortable with a man in our safe space.
I guess, emotionally.
I just need time to process this.
Joan, Neil is a beautiful and sensitive poet.
he's part of my family and we are going to welcome him today with open arms and open ears.
okay, fine.
but he's a man.
Joan, what you need to focus on is not the presence of a man in this room, but the lack of your mother's presence in your poetry.
Neil.
the Angry Nun.
by Neil Bookman.
bitch!
whore of Jesus!
dressed in black, you do not bleed like a woman should bleed between the legs!
but with your ruler, your crucifix of hatred, you strike my tender flesh!
I bleed for you!
Oh, Mother.
and then I ran out of ink.
good anger. It ended exactly at the right moment.
Augusten, would you make me some iced tea?
my new medicine makes my throat so dry.
baby, I'll get it. I got it.
all right, all right, Neil. Let's break it down. Let's break it down for Neil.
look, I always get my mom something to drink when she works. Okay?
that's our thing. - Your mother is my thing now.
are we having a stare-down contest?
Yeah.
what do you want? What do you want? Money?
here's 50 bucks. Go chase the ice-cream truck.
leave!
you think this whole thing is funny, don't you?
you look at my mom's craziness as something to entertain you!
you are so mundane. Your mother is an artist.
if you want Hamburger Helper, cupcake, you need to find yourself another mother.
everyone! Come quickly!
wake up! Wake up!
a miracle!
a miracle! A miracle has occurred!
what are you looking at?
dad's morning shit.
see? See how the tip of the coil is breaking out of the surface of the water?
holy Father.
doctor.
let me draw you a nice bath.
Agnes.
go get a shoehorn. A shoehorn, Agnes.
but what does it mean, Dad?
it means our financial situation is turning round.
it means things are looking upward, literally.
the shit is pointing out of the pot, towards heaven, to God.
my turd is a direct communication from the Holy Father.
no, no, no, no, children. No. Laugh. Laugh.
God is. He is the funniest man in the universe.
Agnes, I want you to carefully remove this, take it outside and let it dry in the sun.
we're starting a shrine, Agnes, a shrine.
hope, let's prepare.
now I'll never get into Vassar.
Agnes?
somebody's gotta stay on top of things in this house.
I am just trying to hold it all together.
I need to ask you something.
he's fine. The doctor will be fine.
he's just overextended.
that's not what I wanted to ask you. - What do you want, Augusten?
I want you to make me Hamburger Helper.
so there it was at last, the awful truth.
thank you.
unlike my mom, I guess I had finally tapped into my subconscious.
journal, I feel doomed. I should be getting ready for college.
instead, I'm in my mother's psychiatrist's house lying on a used twin bed with pee stains on it.
how did my life take such a dismal turn? What did I do wrong along the way?
I turned 15 today.
my parents used to make such a big deal out of my birthdays, out of all the holidays.
I want it to be like it used to be, when I had a family that tried to love each other.
where nobody thought that God was talking through their shit.
I want a curfew.
I want to be grounded for sleeping with a 35-year-old schizophrenic.
I want rules and boundaries, because what I've learned is that without them all life is, is a series of surprises.
surprise!
we gotcha!
surprise.
we gotcha! And you didn't see it coming. No, you didn't.
smile.
Augusten, what's wrong?
he's just overcome, that's all.
I'll go get the matches.
this is good.
Deirdre?
Deirdre, come along now.
I'm not going to any goddamn hospital!
now, Deirdre, it's just for observation.
this is bullshit! - Dorothy!
I will not be observed!
Deirdre, I have arranged a very, very nice retreat for you in Vermont.
but if you don't open the door, we will have to get the police.
no, don't you call the police! Why you gotta go to call the pigs?
Oh, please! Oh, that's right, you think anyone that's not a lesbian is a pig!
you're all pigs! - Oh, you fucking selfish bitch!
filthy, stinking pigs! You just wanna hurt her!
will you stop? Please!
you stop! You stop!
Oh, please, why don't you go out and write your fucking poetry?
you don't need a mother! You need an exorcist!
Oh, you need a fucking bone up your ass, that's what you need!
and you'd like that, you'd like that!
now.
no, no. - Shit, shit.
we love you.
we love you.
No! No!
no, let me go!
please let me go!
let me go!
thank you.
thank you.
Oh, this is too much.
thank you so much.
grief.
the angels are gone.
for weeks I searched for them "and took the precise measurements of each room, "as if the house had grown smaller in my grief.
not good enough. Boring. Repetitive.
journal, good news.
after only a week of observation, my mother has been released from the loony bin.
Dr. Finch assures me she's doing well, and is writing a masterpiece that will finally get her on The Merv Griffin Show.
I wish I had that kind of discipline.
watch out. That's how he gets you to fall in love with him.
our first date was at the movies. My Fair Lady.
I was so nervous my palms were sweaty.
but Norman's hands were so dry.
I found out later it was from psoriasis.
he reached for my hand in the dark and that was it.
Hello, Norman.
Hello, Deirdre. You look well.
I'm sorry, Suzanne, this is my ex-wife, Deirdre.
hello.
it's nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you.
I've heard nothing about you.
I open up my mailbox every day, hoping to get a child support check from this deadbeat, but all I get is my own voice echoing back at me.
you drank our family's money away.
I don't drink anymore, Deirdre. I haven't had a drink in three years.
excuse me, could you get him a medal?
I want my money!
I sent your money to that goddamn Svengali, and his lawyer sent me a paper signed by you giving him power of attorney.
no. I didn't approve that.
Dr. Finch wouldn't do that.
did I tell you?
what? Did you tell her what? What did he tell you about me, Suzie Q?
that I was a little housewife with a stupid hobby?
well, that hobby has become quite lucrative, thank you very much.
I was just published in Yankee Magazine.
ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to quiet down and leave.
what else did he tell you about me? That I was crazy?
he's the crazy one. And he's a goddamn bastard.
he doesn't even see his own son!
he's tried. From what I hear, neither do you, Deirdre.
shut up, you cunt!
all right, that's it. Let's go.
get your hands off me!
I'm leaving here.
I need a peaceful environment to do my writing in.
could you get me a towel, please?
Jesus. Fuck.
are you wet? Did you get wet? - I'm fine.
okay.
like a sheep or a dog that can predict an earthquake,
I've always been able to sense when my mother is about to go crazy.
her eyes burn electric. Her body gives off a metallic scent.
she stops sleeping and starts developing a taste for certain foods like toothpaste sandwiches.
but journal, I think the worst is over. I really do.
hospitals make you better. My mother is going to get better.
Dorothy's gone. She took everything.
I don't wanna be alone so you're moving back in with me.
she's gone?
just you and me, baby. Come here.
Augusten, hug back.
could you make me some tea, sweetheart?
sure.
did I tell you I had a poem accepted by Yankee Magazine?
Really?
that's great.
mom, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm decoupaging my rejection letters on top of the table here.
Why?
well, I want a daily reminder of my artistic journey when I become famous.
this'll keep me humble.
mom, why did you mix your pills with Dorothy's medicine?
Dr. Finch says that's what made you sick.
I'd rather not talk about that right now.
this whole episode's been very intense for me.
but I do believe that may have been my last psychotic episode.
I think I finally broke through to my creative unconscious.
did Dorothy take all the cups, too?
she's such a bitch.
Oh, no, no. They're out back on the lawn.
what the fuck have you been up to?
giving my worldly possessions a moon bath.
anything the doctor's touched, anything he's looked at, needs to be sterilized by the night.
I can't believe I just trusted you.
you have to trust me. I'm your mother.
and honestly, Augusten, I worry about you.
I disapprove of your choices.
I haven't had a choice!
you did when you wrote this, didn't you?
you read my journal? - Don't try and compete with me, Augusten.
if you move back in with me, I won't allow it.
you'll only get hurt.
when I become a very famous woman, they'll write that I had a son who is a writer, too, who doesn't compare to my brilliance. I want more for you than that.
did you mix your pills again?
are you judging me?
where are you going?
are you gonna call the doctor? That bastard! He took my money!
I won't be taken advantage of again. Is that clear?
what are you doing in there?
let me in!
are you calling the doctor?
neighbors reporting domestic disturbance...
good evening, ma'am... - Get off of my property!
don't you dare tell me what to do, not ever! You understand me?
ma'am, you need to calm down... - Fuck you!
I will not be stifled in my own home!
hope, Hope. It's Augusten. - You are the goddamn devil! You are a Nazi!
my mom's gone crazy again and I need your help.
we need Dad.
Finch gave her a sedative.
I like watching her sleep.
she looks like she's dead.
maybe she's finally at peace.
none of us'll ever be at peace, until Finch and every bad seed spawned from Finch is dead.
you sound crazy.
come on, let's go to bed.
Neil?
Neil?
what are you doing, son? - Shut up!
I'm not your son!
what in the hell is going on?
it's all right.
Neil.
Neil.
Neil!
where did he go? - Away.
why don't we ever have any relish in this house?
what happened?
it was a family situation. It's been handled.
Natalie, you have to tell me, okay?
where did Bookman go?
where the fuck are you?
I needed to get away.
my father's very upset with you.
he feels like you're taking your mother's side in this and he needs your support because he wants to have her committed for good to a hospital.
I don't think she needs to be committed.
look, where are you? We'll come get you. - Okay.
do you have a pen?
Yeah.
okay, tell me where you are.
I'll tell you where I'll be tomorrow at noon.
the bus station.
I'm going to New York.
you're coming with me.
we gotta get away from them, Nat.
your family, my mother.
it's the only way that we can have a normal life.
what's going on?
what are we gonna do in New York, Augusten?
our only skills are restraining psychotics.
I'll write.
and I'll get a job so you can go to school.
I'll support us.
I'm afraid, Augusten.
me, too.
but we can do this.
we have to.
did a woman come in here by herself?
can I take your order?
Yes, I'd like a TaB and a slice of key lime pie.
Oh, nothing for me, thanks.
aren't you hungry? You look skinny.
you really should eat something.
don't pull that maternal crap with me now, Mom.
it's too late for that.
no, it's not too late.
we can find a house together where we both can write.
we can start over.
I am starting over.
in New York.
Really? Well, how are you gonna make that work, Augusten?
you've no formal education, no money, no furniture, no friends.
Yeah, well, could be worse.
could be going to a prom.
why did you come here then?
to say goodbye to you.
did you pack enough warm clothes?
Yeah.
I'm gonna be okay.
Natalie's not coming.
I told her I'd deal with you.
don't try to stop me, Agnes.
I'm going.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you, too.
you're the best son a mom could ever want.
you need to know that.
Oh, my God.
Agnes, there's a lot of money in here.
penny here, a dime there.
it adds up.
the doctor doesn't know I have it, of course. No one does.
you know, this morning the IRS came again and I almost gave it to them.
and then I thought, no.
for once in my life I'm going to invest wisely.
when you write a book, you send me a copy.
goodbye, my sweet boy.
Agnes?
what are you gonna do now?
I don't know.
maybe I'll take down the Christmas tree.
Saigon.
shit.
I'm still only in Saigon.
every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back in thejungle.
when I was home after my first tour, it was worse.
I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.
I hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce.
when I was here, I wanted to be there.
when I was there, all I could think of was getting back into thejungle.
I'm here a week now.
waiting for a mission...
getting softer.
every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker.
and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger.
each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter.
everyone gets everything he wants.
I wanted a mission...
and for my sins, they gave me one.
brought it up to me like room service.
captain Willard? Are you in there?
Yeah, I'm comin'.
it was a real choice mission.
and when it was over,
I'd never want another.
what do you want?
are you all right, Captain?
what does it look like?
are you Willard, 505th Battalion? -Affirmative.
173rd Airborne? -Yeah.
assigned to SOG? -Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?
we have orders to escort you to the airfield.
what are the charges?
What'd I do? -There's no charges, Captain.
you have orders to report to Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang.
I see. -All right?
Nha Trang, for me? -That's right.
come on, Captain. You still have a few hours to get cleaned up.
I'm not feeling too good. -Captain?
Dave, come here and give me a hand. We got a dead one.
come on, Captain. Let's take a shower.
don't be an ass. -Get a hold of him good.
we're gonna take a shower, Captain. In we go.
stand underneath this, Captain.
I was going to the worst place in the world...
and I didn't even know it yet.
weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river...
that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable...
plugged straight into Kurtz.
it was no accident that I got to be the caretaker of Colonel Walter E. kurtz's memory.
any more than being back in Saigon was an accident.
there is no way to tell his story without telling my own.
if his story is really a confession
captain Willard reporting, sir.
then so is mine.
captain. Good. Come on in. -Thank you, sir.
stand at ease.
general.
you want a cigarette?
no, thank you, sir.
have you ever seen this man before?
no, sir. -Met the general or myself?
no, sir. Not personally.
you've worked a lot on your own?
Yes, sir, I have.
your report specifiIes intelligence...
counter intelligence with Com-Sec, I Corps.
I'm not presently disposed to discuss those operations, sir.
did you not work for the CIA in " I " Corps?
no, sir.
did you not assassinate a government tax collector Quang Tri Province, June 1 8, 1 968?
captain?
sir, I am unaware of any such activity or operation
nor would I be disposed to discuss such an operation if it did, in fact, exist, sir.
I thought we'd have a bite of lunch while we talk.
I hope you brought a good appetite, Captain.
I notice that you have a bad hand there.
you wounded?
I had a little fishing accident on R and R, sir.
fishing on R and R? -Yes, sir.
but you're feeling fit? You're ready for duty?
Yes, General. Very much so, sir.
well, let's see what we have here, roast beef, and usually it's not bad.
try some, Jerry, and pass it around.
to save a little time, we might pass both ways.
captain, I don't know how you feel about this shrimp...
but if you'll eat it you'll never have to prove your courage in any other way.
I swear, why don't I just take a piece here?
captain, you've heard of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz?
Yes, sir, I've heard the name.
Oh, Jesus!
operations officer, Fifth Special Forces.
Luke, would you play that tape for the captain, please?
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. -Listen to this carefully, Captain.
october 6, 0430 hours, sector Peter, Victor, king.
these were monitored out of Cambodia.
this has been verifiIed as Col. kurtz's voice.
I watched a snail...
crawl along the edge of a straight razor.
that's my dream.
that's my nightmare.
crawling, slithering...
along the edge of a straight razor and surviving.
transmission 1 1, received '68, December 30, 0500 hours.
sector King, Zulu, King.
but we must kill them.
we must incinerate them.
pig after pig.
cow after cow.
village after village. Army after army.
and they call me an assassin.
what do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin?
they lie.
they lie, and we have to be merciful for those who lie.
those nabobs.
I hate them.
I do hate them.
Walt kurtz was one of the most outstanding offiIcers this country's ever produced.
he was brilliant. He was outstanding in every way.
and he was a good man, too, a humanitarian man.
a man of wit and humor.
he joined the Special Forces.
and after that his ideas, methods became unsound
unsound.
now he's crossed into Cambodia with this...
Montagnard army of his that worship the man like a god...
and follow every order, however ridiculous.
well, I have some other shocking news to tell you.
col. Kurtz was about to be arrested for murder.
I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?
kurtz had ordered the execution of some Vietnamese intelligence agents
men he believed were double agents.
so he took matters into his own hands.
well, you see, Willard...
in this war, things get confused out there.
power, ideals, the old morality...
and practical military necessity.
but out there with these natives...
it must be a temptation to be God.
because there's a conflict in every human heart...
between the rational and the irrational...
between good and evil...
and good does not always triumph.
sometimes...
the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.
every man has got a breaking point.
you and I have them.
Walt kurtz has reached his.
and very obviously, he has gone insane.
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir. Obviously insane.
your mission is to proceed up the Nung River in a navy patrol boat
pick up Col. kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba...
follow it, learn what you can along the way.
when you find the colonel, infiIltrate his team by whatever means available and terminate the colonel's command.
terminate the colonel?
he's out there operating without any decent restraint...
totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct...
and he is still on the field, commanding troops.
terminate with extreme prejudice.
you understand, Captain, that this mission does not exist nor will it ever exist.
how many people had I already killed?
there were those six that I knew about for sure
close enough to blow their last breath in my face.
but this time it was an American...
and an officer.
that wasn't supposed to make any difference to me...
but it did.
shit.
charging a man with murder in this place...
was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.
I took the mission.
what the hell else was I gonna do?
but I really didn't know what I'd do when I found him.
did you check the tank?
Yeah.
I was being ferried down the coast in a navy PBR...
a type of plastic patrol boat
a pretty common sight on the rivers.
they said it was a good way to pick up information and move...
without drawing a lot of attention, and that was okay.
I needed the air and the time.
only problem was I wouldn't be alone.
mornin', Captain.
the crew were mostly just kids
rockand rollers with one foot in their graves.
how old are you? -Seventeen.
the machinist--the one they called Chef
was from New Orleans.
he was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.
probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans.
Lance, on the forward fifties was a famous surfer from the beaches south of L. A.
to look at him, you wouldn't believe he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.
Clean--Mr. Clean--was from some South Bronx shit-hole...
and I think the light and the space of Vietnam...
really put the zap on his head.
then there was Phillips, the chief.
it might have been my mission, but it sure as shit was the chief " s boat.
there's about two points where we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River.
they're both hot. Belong to Charlie.
don't worry about it.
don't smoke.
you know, I've pulled a few special ops in here.
about six months ago...
I took a man who was going up past the bridge at Do Lung.
he was regular army too.
heard he shot himself in the head.
at first I thought they handed me the wrong dossier.
I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead.
third-generation West Point, top of his class.
korea, Airborne, about a thousand decorations.
et cetera, et cetera.
I'd heard his voice on the tape, and it really put the hookin me...
but I couldn't connect up that voice with this man.
like they said, he had an impressive career.
maybe too impressive.
I mean, perfect.
he was being groomed for one of the top slots in the corporation
general, chief of staff, anything.
in 1 664, he returned from a tour with Advisory Command in Vietnam...
and things started to slip.
his report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.
seems they didn't dig what he had to tell them.
during the next few months, he made three requests for transfer to Airborne training, Fort Benning, Georgia, and was finally accepted.
airborne?
he was 38 years old.
why the fuck would he do that?
1966, joins Special Forces...
returns to Vietnam.
Hey, what's that?
arc light. -What's up?
b-52 strike. -Yeah?
what's that? -Arc light.
I hate that. Every time I hear that, something terrible happens.
Charlie don't never see 'em or hear 'em, man.
there they are.
concussion will suck the air out of your damn lungs.
something terrible is gonna happen.
smoke!
secondary burning.
hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.
let's have a look, Chief.
it was the Air-Cav. First of the Ninth
that's them.
our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River.
but they were supposed to be waiting for us another 30 kilometers ahead.
well, Air Mobile. Those boys just couldn't stay put.
Hey, kid, come on. Get down. Come on.
first of the Ninth was an old cavalry division...
that had cashed in its horses for choppers...
and gone tear-assing around 'Nam looking for the shit.
they'd given Charlie a few surprises in their time here.
what they were mopping up now hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.
just keeping running by. We're for television.
don't look at the camera. Just keep--Go on. keep going.
this is for television. Don't look at the camera.
just go by like you're fighting, like you're fighting.
don't look at the camera. It's for television. Just go through.
just go by. keep on going.
keep going. Don't look at the camera. Go on. keep going.
all right, come on. Go.
right here. Yes. Over here. Over here.
where can I find the CO?
that's the colonel comin' down!
the CO's on that chopper.
lieutenant, bomb that tree line back about 1 00 yards!
give me some room to breathe! -Yes, sir!
body cards!
bring my body cards! -Yes, sir!
I'm the Fourth Tank commander. I got five tanks broken down.
we're all right with the tanks. It's all right, Captain.
captain Willard!
I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.
I understand Nha Trang has briefed you...
on the requirements of my mission.
what mission? I haven't heard from Nha Trang.
sir, your unit is supposed to escort us into the Nung!
we'll see what we can do. -Colonel!
but just stay out of my way until this is done, Captain.
all right, let's see what we have. Let's see what we have.
a two of spades, three of spades, four of diamonds...
six of clubs, eight of spades.
there isn't one worth a jack in the whole bunch.
four of diamonds.
Hey, Captain, what's that? -Death cards!
what? -Death cards!
death? -Lets Charlie know who did this.
cheer up, son. -We will not hurt or harm you.
fire in the hole! -Fire in the hole!
this is an area that is controlled by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.
Jim.
we are here to help you.
we extend a welcome hand...
come on. Everybody in? -To those who would like to return...
to the arms of the South Vietnamese government.
get in. Hurry up.
move it out. -This is an area that is controlled by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.
Hey! What's this?
what is this?
this man's hurt pretty bad, sir.
about the only thing that's holding his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.
yeah? What do you have to say?
this soldier is dirty VC.
he wants water. He can drink paddy water.
get out here! Give me that canteen.
he's VC! -Any man that's brave enough to get outta here! I'll kick your fuckin' ass!
he killed a lot of our people!
any man brave enough to fiIght with his guts strapped on him can drink from my canteen.
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.
where? Here? You sure?
yeah? Here.
down there.
repeat. We have a body count. We have
what's your name, sailor?
gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson.
gunner's Mate Third Class
lance Johnson, the surfer?
Yes, sir.
it's an honor to meet you.
I've admired your nose riding for years.
I like your cutback too.
I think you have the best cutback there is.
thank you, sir. -You can cut out the " sir " crap.
I'm Bill kilgore. I'm a goofy foot.
this guy with ya? -Yeah.
I want you to meet some guys.
this is Mike from San Diego. -Far out.
Johnny from Malibu.
John, hi. Far out. -Solid surfers.
none of us are anywhere near your class though.
no way.
we do a lot of surfing around here.
I like to finish operations early.
fly down to Yung Tau for the evening glass.
been riding since you got here?
no way. I haven't surfed since I been here.
through Christ, our Lord from Whom all good things come...
through Him in the unity of the Holy Spirit.
all glory and honor is Yours, Almighty Father.
let us bring our iniquities to the Father in the words our Savior gave us.
our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
thy kingdom come.
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread...
and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
kilgore had had a pretty good day for himself.
they choppered in the T-bones and the beer...
and turned the LZ into a beach party.
the more they tried to make it just like home...
the more they made everybody miss it.
make my meat rare--rare but not cold.
well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.
he loved his boys, and you felt safe with him.
he was one of those guys that had that weird light around him.
you just knew he wasn't gonna get so much as a scratch here.
what happened to your mission?
Nha Trang forget all about you?
airborne.
sir, two places we can get into the river.
Yeah. -Here and here.
it's a pretty wide delta, but these are the only two spots I'm sure of.
that village you're pointing at is kind of hairy.
what do you mean " hairy, " sir? -It's hairy.
got some pretty heavy ordnance.
I lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
what's the name of that goddamn village?
vin Drin Dop. Dop or Lop?
damn gook names all sound the same.
Mike, you know anything about this point at Vin Drin Dop?
that's a fantastic peak.
peak? -About six foot.
it's an outstanding peak. It's got both the long right and left slide...
with a bowl section that's unbelievable. It's just tube city.
why didn't you tell me that before? A good peak.
there aren't any good peaks in this whole shitty country.
it's all goddamn beach break. -It's really hairy in there.
that's where we lost McDonald.
they shot the hell out of us there. That's Charlie's point.
sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.
there's always a good offshore breeze in the morning.
we may not be able to get the boat in.
the draft at the mouth of that river may be too shallow.
we'll pick your boat up and put it down like a baby where you want it.
this is the First of the Ninth, Air-Cav, son.
air mobile!
I can take that point and hold it as long as I like.
you can get anyplace up that river that suits you, young Captain.
hell, a six-foot peak.
take a gunship back to the division.
Lance, go with Mike and let him pick out a board for you.
bring me my Yater Spoon, the eight-six.
I don't know, sir -What is it, soldier?
it's hairy in there. It's Charlie's point.
Charlie don't surf!
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't gonna believe this. Look.
Hey, man! They're pickin' up the boat!
how are you feeling, Jimmy?
like a mean motherfucker, sir!
all right, son, let 'er rip.
let's go!
I never have got used to a light board.
I can't get used to one.
I'm used to a heavy board. -I know, it's a real drag.
you prefer a heavy or light board? -Heavier.
Really? -Yeah!
I thought all the young guys like lighter boards.
you can't ride the nose on those.
big Duke Six. Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
this is Eagle Thrust Seven. We've got it spotted.
put on heading two-seven-zero.
assume attack formation.
that's a roger, Big Duke.
we're going in.
Hey, Lance, we'll come in low out of the rising sun.
about a mile out, we'll put on the music.
music? -Yeah, I use Wagner.
scares the hell out of the slopes. My boys love it.
Hey, they're gonna play music!
how come all you guys sit on your helmet?
so we don't get our balls blown off.
big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust. Put on psy war op.
make it loud. This is a Romeo Fox Trot.
shall we dance?
Yes, sir!
come on! -All right. Fire.
we got a couple--at that tree line.
we're taking fire from the holes.
run, Charlie!
this should make everything burn.
we got a couple of people ahead here.
what's going down here?
we got an automatic! Shoot to kill!
shoot to kill in the open!
I spotted a large weapon down below.
we're gonna go down and check it out.
all right, this is Fox Trot. We're pullin'in.
what a shot.
outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.
get you a case of beer for that.
Six-four-one-zero, we're over the village right now.
I see a vehicle in the courtyard. I'm gonna check it out.
well done, Hawks.
want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan along those tree lines.
ripple the shit out of'em.
got a vehicle on the bridge, 50 caliber on board.
he's moving across to resupply the weapon.
big Duke Six, clear the area. I'm coming down myself.
don't these people ever give up?
nice shot, Bill.
shit! -All right, all right!
it's just a flare! It's a flare!
gotta get outta here! -Un-ass that shit.
get it outta here!
get it out. It's just a flare. It's all right.
everybody all right? Lance?
I'm fine!
get down!
I'm not going! I'm not going!
I'm not going.
we just got a secondary down there in the plaza.
hold on to your position.
Duke Six, we've got wounded down there.
get a stretcher over here!
please, God! Help me!
give him some morphine. -My God! Oh!
Where's that duster?
I want my wounded out of there and in the hospital in 1 5 minutes.
I want my men out.
somebody stay in there tight with Big Duke.
this is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in, throw 'em on and get out.
she's got a grenade!
she's got a grenade!
the whole thing blew up.
she blew the shit -Fucking savages.
get a medevac.
holy Christ, she's a SAP. I'm gonna get that dinkbitch.
get over there, Johnny. Roll that right skid right up her ass.
we gotta get some air in these trees.
it's goddamn eat-up with enemy down here.
I'm taking fire. I'm taking hits all over.
three o'clock! I'm drawing heavy fire!
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm goin'in. My tail rotor's out. I got control.
what do you think? -Wow! This is really exciting, man.
No! No! The waves!
the waves! -Oh, right.
look at that. Breaks both ways.
watch.
watch. Look! Good six-foot swells!
come here, Lance.
incoming!
this LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.
what do you know about surfiIng, Major?
you're from goddamn New Jersey.
come here! Come here!
change! -You mean right now, sir?
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is. Go change.
it's still pretty hairy out there.
do you wanna surf, soldier? -Yes, sir.
that's good, son, 'cause you either surf or fight.
that clear?
get going.
I'll cover for 'em. And bring a board for Lance.
we can't do shit until the boat gets here.
Lance, I'll bet you can't wait to get out there.
what? -See how they break both ways?
one guy can break right, one left, simultaneous.
what do you think?
we ought to wait for the tide to come up.
come here. Look. -Incoming!
the tide doesn't come in for six hours!
you wanna wait here for six hours?
yo! Chief! Chief!
okay, fellas, quit hiding.
come on! Let's go!
goddamn it!
don't you think it's a little risky for R and R?
if I say it's safe to surf this beach, it's safe to surf this beach!
I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fuckin' place.
give me that R-T, soldier.
dove Four, this is Big Duke Six. Goddamn it!
I want that tree line bombed!
big Duke Six, roger. Dove One-Three, stand by.
blow them into the Stone Age, son!
out! -No, back, no!
let me take care of this.
get that out of here!
I'm sorry. -Come here now. All right.
no, ma'am. Sorry!
Jimmy!
hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three.
they need some napalm in the tree line.
can you put it down there?
right, One-Three. We're fixin' to fuck with 'em.
what's the target?
we're trying to suppress some mortar fire off the tree line down there.
Roger. Here we come.
good. Give it all you got. Bring in all your ships.
put him in my chopper. Get him back to the hospital.
no, no, no, you got to go with him. -Come on! Go!
get it outta here! Tell my guys I want my board!
big Duke Six, this is Dove One-Three. The jets are inbound now.
you got about 30 seconds to bomb station.
get your people backand heads down.
this is gonna be a big one.
don't worry.
we'll have this place cleaned up in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.
give me those shorts.
these are from the Air-Cav, a present from me and the boys.
I want to see you do your stuff in 'em out there.
you smell that?
do you smell that? -What?
napalm, son.
nothing else in the world smells like that.
come on. Move it! Move it! Move it!
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
you know, one time we had a hill bombed for 1 2 hours.
when it was all over, I walked up.
we didn't fiInd one of them, not one stinking dink body.
but the smell--You know, that gasoline smell.
the whole hill smelled like...
victory.
someday this war's gonna end.
Lance! The wind!
the wind! -What?
it's blowin' onshore!
it's gonna blow this place out.
it's gonna ruin it! -Not cool!
it's gonna blow out! -It's the goddamn napalm!
that's what's doin' it! -I know.
I'm really sorry, Colonel. I'm afraid that does it.
the kid's got a reputation.
you can't expect him to surf those sloppy waves.
I understand. -I'm an artist, Bill.
I couldn't surf that stuff.
I apologize. It's not my fault.
the waves are gettin' blown out by the napalm.
don't get me wrong
it was the bombs causing a vortex with the wind.
I accept your apology.
but if you could hang around 20 minutes
some other time, Bill. -Just 20 minutes!
I'm an artist. -keep walking.
okay, give it a try, guys.
one goes left and one goes right.
look, Lance.
you through surfiIng? -Yeah!
wanna say good-bye to the colonel? -No.
you sure? -Yeah!
get the fuck outta here. -It's the napalm.
just wait 20 minutes!
Damn! Fuck!
they've been lookin' for ya.
don't leave without me! -Where the fuck you goin'?
here!
that's the colonel's surfboard!
incoming! Hey, get the fuck off me! It's mine!
Lance. -Chef, light up, man.
come on. Let's get high.
wanna smoke? -Let's do it, man. Light up.
someday this war's gonna end.
that would bejust fine with the boys on the boat.
they weren't looking for anything more than a way home.
captain? -Trouble is, I'd been back there...
and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore.
buddha time. Here.
all right, that's great, you motherfuckers. Yeah.
if that's how kilgore fought the war...
I began to wonder what they really had against Kurtz.
it wasn't just insanity and murder.
there was enough of that to go around for everyone.
I mean, he never was hurtin' for pussy.
I'm not here. I'm walking through the jungle gathering mangos.
I meet Raquel Welch.
I make a nice mango cream pudding.
you know, kind of spread it around on us.
she's into mangos too.
she's like one limb above me.
we're both in the jungle here nude. -Hey, Chief.
yeah? -Here comes that colonel guy again.
you know how hard it is to find a board you like.
I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.
just give me back the board, Lance.
it was a good board, and I like it.
you know how hard it is to find a board you like.
he's a determined motherfucker!
I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.
just give me back the board, Lance.
it was a good board, and I like it.
you know how hard it is to find a board you like.
I will not hurt or harm you. -Jesus Christ.
that guy's too fuckin' much, man.
do you think he would have shot us?
he wouldn't have shot us on the beach...
but he would have shot us if he saw me taking his board.
let's go surfin'now Everybody's learnin'how -Let's get this board out of my turret. -Sucker.
how am I going to shoot him the next time he comes around?
Hey, Chef, make some room back there for the board.
sock it to me, Lance.
I wonder if that's the same chopper.
he's probably got them all over the river with that recording.
we'll have to hold up here till dark, Chief.
don't worry, Lance. He won't follow us too far.
what makes you say that?
you think that big Cav colonel wants everyone upriver...
to know we stole his board? －I didn't steal it!
captain?
just how far up this river we goin'?
it's classifiIed, Chief. I can't tell ya.
we're goin' up pretty far.
is it gonna be hairy?
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.
you like it like that, Captain, when it's hot, hairy?
fuck.
maybe you'll get a chance to know what the fuck you are in some factory in Ohio.
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those mangos now, okay?
take somebody with ya. -Yeah, I'll take
I'll go with him.
chef?
Yes, sir? -How come they call you that?
call me what, sir? -Chef.
because you like mangos and stuff?
no, sir, I'm a real chef.
I'm a saucier. -Saucier?
Yes, sir. See,
I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier, a great saucier.
what's a saucier? -You specialize in sauces.
gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.
then, I was supposed to go to Paris...
study at the EscoffiIer school.
but then I got orders for my physical.
hell, I joined the navy.
heard they had better food.
cook school--That did it.
Yeah, how's that? -You don't wanna hear about that.
they lined us up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib.
all of us, you know, lined up lookin' at it.
MagnifiIcent meat. Really! Beautifully marbled.
next thing, they're throwing the meat into these big cauldrons
all of it--boiling it!
I looked inside, man. It was turning gray.
I couldn't fucking believe that one.
that's when I applied for radioman school, but then they gave me
what is it?
Charlie?
it's a tiger! Son of a bitch!
it's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!
battle stations. Lance, up front.
get on your 60! -Got it.
holy shit! Chef, come on!
a fuckin' tiger!
captain, come on!
let's go!
you were right. Never get out of the boat.
bring that 60 forward!
I gotta remember! Never get out of the boat!
never get out of the boat!
what happen? How many is it?
a fuckin' tiger! -What? A tiger?
Yes! I've had it!
I've had the whole goddamn fuckin' shit, man!
you can kiss my ass on the county square...
because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.
I don't fuckin' need it! I don't want it.
all I wanted to do was fuckin' cook!
I just wanted to learn to fuckin' cook, man!
you're all right.
you're all right. You're gonna be all right.
never get out of the fuckin' boat.
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Good-bye!
never get out of the boat.
absolutely, goddamn right...
unless you were going all the way.
kurtz got off the boat.
he split from the whole fuckin'program.
how did that happen?
what did he see here that first tour?
thirty-eight fucking years old.
if you joined the Green Berets...
there was no way you'd ever get above colonel.
kurtz knew what he was giving up.
the more I read and began to understand...
the more I admired him.
his family and friends couldn't understand it...
and they couldn't talk him out of it.
he had to apply three times, and he put up with a ton of shit.
but when he threatened to resign, they gave it to him.
the next youngest guy in his class was half his age.
they must have thought he was some far-out old man...
humping it over that course.
I did it when I was 1 6. It damn near wasted me.
a tough motherfucker.
he finished it.
he could have gone for general...
but he went for himself instead.
dear Eva...Today was really a new one.
almost got eaten alive by a fuckin' tiger.
really un-fucking believable, you know?
we're taking this guy, Captain Willard, up the river...
but he hasn't told us yet where we're taking him.
thought you might have heard by now from Elwood.
october 1 667.
on special assignment Kontoom Province, II Corps.
kurtz staged Operation Archangel with combined local forces.
rated a major success.
he received no official clearance.
he just thought it up and did it.
what balls.
they were gonna nail his ass to the floorboards for that one.
but after the press got ahold of it...
they promoted him to full colonel instead.
Oh, man, the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam.
you needed wings to stay above it.
this sure enough is a bizarre sight in the middle of this shit.
expecting us this time?
damned if I know.
Jesus
it goes back up into the truck. -What?
we gotta get all that stuff up.
Hau Phat. You ever been up here before, Chef?
I bet you we can score up here.
check out the bikes, Lance.
yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!
that's a good one. -Yeah, Sukiyaki.
Yeah, man. This is something.
please! -This must be the guy.
right over there.
sergeant.
three drums of diesel fuel, PBR five
come on, man! Move! We don't have time.
one hour. That's all. What do you want?
can I get some Panama Red? -Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.
sergeant? -Destination?
I don't have no destination.
I can't do a goddamn thing without a destination.
Sarge? Sarge? -I need a destination!
I can't do a thing about it with a destination.

Charlie didn't get much USO.
he was dug in too deep or moving too fast.
his idea of great R and R was cold rice and a little rat meat.
he had only two ways home
death or victory.
no wonder Kurtz put a weed up Command's ass.
the war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns...
who were gonna end up giving the whole circus away.
Hey, you know, man, that was far-fucking-out.
I collected every picture of her since she was Miss December, Chief.
Hey, Clean, look at that. She was here, man.
I even wrote to the cunt.
she didn't write me back.
you can really get hung up on these broads, man...
just like that cat in the delta.
Yeah, you better believe it. -What cat?
the one that went up for murder.
he was an army sergeant.
remember? This cat, man--He really dug his Playboy, man.
I mean like this guy
when the thing arrived, he was there to meet it, man.
look at these beautiful fuckin' jugs, man!
Yeah, so anyway, he was workin' ARVN patrols.
one of them cocky gook asshole lieutenants and shit
one day the gook took his magazine and wouldn't give it back.
he said, Give me my magazine back.
gook say, You shut up.
I have you court-martialed.
typical fuckin' ARVN. -Yeah!
then the gook starts to go too far.
chef. Take the wheel.
this dude started to stick pinholes in the lady's tits.
he started sticking pinholes and mutilating the centerfold.
the sergeant said, You better not do that to her.
you leave your shitty little gook hands off of that girl.
don't do her like that. "
gook say " Fuck you " in Vietnamese. -Damn.
the sergeant couldn't handle it no more.
he just picked up his iron...
flipped it to rock and roll and
gave that little zero a long burst straight through the Playboy mag.
it blew his ass clean off of the dock.
there wasn't no more lieutenant that day.
that was it for his ass.
they burn him for it? -The sergeant? Yeah, man.
they stuck his ass in the LBJ.
it's too bad he didn't get no medals or nothin'.
fuckin' ARVN, man.
they should have killed the fuck.
should have given the fucker a Silver Star.
bummer for the gook though, ain't it?
good morning, Vietnam.
I'm Army Specialist ZackJohnson on AMVN.
it's about 82 degrees in downtown Saigon right now, also very humid.
we have an important message for all GI's...
who are living off base from the mayor of Saigon.
he'd like you to hang your laundry up indoors instead of on the windowsills.
the mayor wants you to keep Saigon beautiful.
now here's another blast from the past going out to Big Sam who's all alone out there with the 1 st Battalion, 35th Infantry...
and dedicated by the fire team to their groovy CO.
the Rolling Stones, " Satisfaction. " -All right!
watch out, Clean!
get down, Bubba!
hang on, Lance!
get down, Bubba!
tell 'em you did it, Lance.
all right!
look out, Lance!
commitment and Counterinsurgency...
by cononel Walt E. kurtz
as long as our officers and troops perform...
tours of duty limited to one year...
they will remain dilettantes in war and tourists in Vietnam.
as long as cold beer, hot food, rockand roll...
and all the other amenities remain the expected norm...
our conduct of the war will gain only impotence.
we need fewer men, and better.
if they were committed, this war could be won...
with a fourth of our present force. "
shit. Chicken time.
you ain't shittin', bro. They're motherfuckin'.
who is that? －What's going on?
is that you, Lazzaro?
fire on the canopy!
I got it! Get outta there!
Yeah! I got it! I got it! I got it!
Lance, get down!
put that fucker out, man!
what the fuck they think they're doin'?
late summer, autumn 1 668.
kurtz's patrols in the highlands coming under frequent ambush.
the camp started falling apart.
november.
kurtz orders assassination of three Vietnamese men and one woman.
two of the men were colonels in the South Vietnamese army.
enemy activity in his old sector dropped off to nothing.
guess he must have hit the right four people.
Hejoined the Special Forces.
after that his
the army tried one last time to bring him backinto the fold.
methods
if he'd pulled over it all would have been forgotten.
unsound.
but he kept going.
now he's crossed into Cambodia
he kept winning it his way.
with this Montagnard army of his
and they called me in.
man like a god and follow every order, however ridiculous.
they lost him.
he was gone.
nothing but rumors and random intelligence...
mostly from captured VC.
the VC knew his name by now, and they were scared of him.
he and his men were playing hit-and-run all the way into Cambodia.
I know what I'm doin'.
I'm goin' to the White House to have dinner...
with the president of the United States.
that's where I'm goin'.
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.
clean.
how long has that kid been on this boat?
seven months.
he's really specializing in busting my balls.
very possible, Captain, he thinks the same of you.
Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?
I don't think.
my orders say I'm not supposed to know where I'm taking this boat so I don't!
but one look at you, and I know it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.
we're going upriver about 7 5 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge.
that's Cambodia, Captain.
that's classifiIed.
we're not supposed to be in Cambodia, but that's where I'm going.
you just get me close to my destination and I'll cut you and the crew loose.
all right, Captain.
dear Son...
I'm afraid that both you and your mother will have been worried At not hearing from me during the past weeks...
but my situation here has become a difficult one.
I have been officially accused of murder by the army.
the alleged victims were four Vietnamese double agents.
we spent months uncovering them and accumulating evidence.
when absolute proof was completed, we acted
we acted like soldiers.
the charges are unjustified.
they are, in fact, and in the circumstances of this conflict...
quite completely insane.
in a war, there are many moments for compassion and tender action.
there are many moments for ruthless action
what is often called ruthless...
but may in many circumstances be only clarity
seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it-- "
medevac, come in. -Directly
quickly, awake.
alpha, Tango, Tango, -Echo, Tango, Alpha. -Looking at it.
request dust-off. Three, maybe four kIA 's. Over.
I trust you tell your mother what you choose about this letter.
as for the charges against me, I am unconcerned.
medevac, come in.
I am beyond their timid, lying morality, and so I am beyond caring.
medevac, do you read? Over.
you have all my faith.
your loving father.
Jesus.
no wonder I couldn't get 'em on the radio.
what a dump.
hi there! -How ya doin'?
that's a nice little boat you got there.
never seen one up here before.
we called in a request for Medevac.
you receive it?
medevac? No.
we passed a downed Huey with some kIA's.
on your way here? -Yeah.
you goin' up this river? -Way up.
way upriver? Forget it.
Why?
we want to send some people downriver.
just forget it. -What the fuck was that?
we'll be back in a couple of days.
Yeah, right, you'll be back.
chief? -Yeah, Captain?
why don't you see what you can do with that engine?
I'm gonna look around. -All right.
Hey, don't leave without me.
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?
don't ask me, man.
give my clothes back, you asshole!
asshole!
Hey, guys, where's the CO?
he stepped on a land mine about two months ago.
he got blown to hell.
who's in charge here? -Charge?
I don't know, man. I'm just the night man.
just do what I'm told. Shit.
I'm just a working girl.
what about you, fella?
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you it's gonna jam.
you mark my words.
keep it in that condition -Get off my back!
no, man, I'm telling you -Lay off!
Hey! Hey! Come here!
is that your boat? Come on inside.
what do you want?
come on inside. I want to talk to you. Come on!
get out of the rain.
get off me!
come on. Cut this shit. Hey, Chef. Hey, come on.
Hey, how ya doin', Captain?
I want you to meet some people.
I got your ass. -Your ass is shit.
chef, your ass is shit!
you're a motherfucker, man.
goddamn, my ear, you motherfucker!
get him off me, Chef. -You smart-ass.
Hey, guys.
I got you! I got your ass!
you ain't shit, Chef. -Hey, fellas.
you pulled my fuckin' -Hey, guys.
I just made a deal with the people from Hau Phat.
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for a couple of hours with the bunnies.
Hey! Hey! You shittin' me?
no, I'm not.
grab a couple of barrels and get up to that big tent.
come on!
captain.
you're giving away our fuel for a playmate of the month?
Nope, playmate of the year, Chief.
warm 'em up, baby!
warm 'em up!
captain, we get in a fiIre fiIght and run out of fuel...
I want you to tell me how she was.
I made a deal for all of us, Chief. How about you?
you got some mamas in there? -Some what?
forget it, Captain. I'll stay with the boat.
Hey, Captain! Give me a hand.
you know, I got a
I got every one of your pictures.
I got the centerfold, the playmate's review...
the playmate of the year runoff.
I even got the calendar.
Hey, oiseau. How come you got a bird?
I used to be the bird girl at Busch Gardens.
Busch Gardens? -I used to train birds there.
you are
you are Miss December, aren't you? -Miss May.
is it coming?
miss December has black hair. -It's over there.
he's not one of my regular birds.
come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
snatch a crack. Come here.
being playmate of the year...
is the loneliest experience I can imagine.
it's like--You try to express...
your feelings to someone and show them your heart
Yeah, I want to hear about your bird act.
I'd love to hear about your bird act.
but would you mind just puttin' this
would you just mind putting this black wig on for me, please?
and there's this glass wall between you
this invisible glass.
they can see your mouth moving.
I used to train birds for at least two years
that's beautiful. -At Busch Gardens.
this was cascading over your right shoulder.
this was open here.
but they can't hear what you're saying.
I used to train them to stand on their head and ride a bicycle
your right hand was-- -Hey, Chef!
get outta here, man! -Come on!
does he want to talk to you?
later. Give me 1 5 minutes.
you can never really make them hear what you're trying to say.
you okay with kind of bending? That's it.
your ass was sticking out just a little--Hey, man, fuck off!
fifteen minutes!
that's why I tried so desperately...
to show somebody that I had some talent.
little baby macaws.
have you ever seen a baby macaw? -That's kind of open there.
they're all blue-- -Take off, would you?
I got my rights, man!
they make you do things you don't wanna do
like, this picture here.
I started feeling repulsed with myself.
you were just kind of bending forward. Your ass kind of out a bit.
I love training birds.
that's it. That's very--That's it. Voila.
you're beautiful. I just want to
you know, I can't believe it.
me, J. Hicks. I can't believe
I'm really here.
maybe I'm unfiIt to have a relationship...
with a beautiful, innocent boy.
just think, if it hadn't been for the Vietnam War...
I never would have met you, Miss December.
miss May.
I wish--I wish I could fiInd...
just one person...
that could share my point of view.
Oh, you kiss like a bird!
Oh, God! kiss me! kiss me!
who is that?
you're drivin' me crazy! kiss me!
I love birds!
you fiInished yet?
Oh! Fuck!
like a bird! Take me like a bird!
fly, baby! Cock it to me!
fly! -I can fly like an eagle!
fly like an eagle! -It drives me crazy!
it drives me crazy!
Lance, that was somebody's son.
Lance, there were things that they made me do...
that I didn't want to do.
they said, " Pull the ribbons between your legs. "
I didn't want to do it.
but they said that was what was expected of me...
that that's what people wanted to see.
who are you? -Well, I'm next, ma'am.
ha, ha! Hell, I didn't know it was a cherry.
didn't know you never got no pussy. -Shove it, fuckup.
sorry about that. If I'd have known,
I'd take you to New Orleans.
man, fuck you. -Introduce you to
lay off, Chef. -Cherry boy, cherry boy.
you're a fuckin' dog!
come to New Orleans.
I'll get you fixed up, ya prick.
lay off, Chef.
you're the only fuckin' prick I see around here.
if I wanna play with a prick, I'll play with my own.
what are you gonna do with it, cherry boy?
chef, I said lay off!
chef, knock it off! Give him a break!
what do you think I said?
then give your jaws a rest!
this ain't the army. You are a sailor!
so get out of that frizzly army-looking shirt...
and stop smoking that dope! You hear me?
Lance, what's with all the green paint?
camouflage. -How's that?
so they can't see ya. They're everywhere, Chief.
I want you to stay awake up there, man. You got a job to do.

what are you talking about?
we're taking her to some friendlies.
she's wounded. She's not dead. -Get out of there.
the book says
fuck you. Fuck 'im.
I told you not to stop. Now let's go.
it was a way we had over here of living with ourselves.
we'd cut 'em in half with a machine gun and give 'em a Band-Aid.
it was a lie.
and the more I saw of them...
the more I hated lies.
those boys were never gonna look at me the same way again...
but I felt like I knew one or two things about kurtz that weren't in the dossier.
do Lung Bridge was the last army outpost on the Nung River.
beyond it, there was only Kurtz.
what do you think? -It's beautiful.
what's the matter with you? You're acting kind of weird.
Hey, you know that last tab of acid I was saving?
Yeah, I know. -I dropped it.
you dropped acid? -Far out.

Why? -Now I can get out of here, if I can find a way.

pick me up at the other side of the bridge.
somebody go with him. -Chef.
I'll go.

Beverly Hills. -What?

where the fuck else do you think it would be?
goddamn it! You stepped in my face.
I thought you were dead.
well, you thought wrong, damn it!
I told you to stop fucking with me, didn't I?
you think you're so bad, huh, nigger?
what are you shooting at, soldier?

Yeah.

Hey, Chief, man. Two guys just got blown off that bridge.

what's that? -Mail, man. Mail.
later on the mail. Watch them trees.
there's no diesel fuel, but I picked up some ammo.
let's move out.
did you fiInd the CO, Captain?
there's no fucking CO here.
let's just get goin'.
which way, Captain?
you know which way, Chief.
you're on your own, Captain.
still wanna go on? It's like this bridge.
we build it every night, Charlie blows it right back up again...
just so the generals can say the road's open.
think about it.
who cares? -Just get us upriver!
chef, on the bow.
stand by, Clean. -Let's go!
whose package is that?
shit, you got another one, Clean. -No shit? Wait a minute.
you got one, Miller. Geez, I got some too.
that's it for you. Lance.
Mr. L. B.Johnson, there you go.
far out, man. All right. I've been waitin' for this one.
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.
Lance. I'm fine. I'm fine.
sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.
sue skinned her knee. "
man, I wanna get back to Antoine's.
I remember the time we went up to-- "
how could I fucking forget?
beautiful.
there could never be a place like Disneyland, or could there?
let me know. "
Jim, it's here. It really is here.
there has been a new development regarding your mission...
which we must now communicate to you.
months ago, a man was ordered on a mission which was identical to yours.
we have reason to believe that he is now operating with Col. Kurtz.
Saigon was carrying him MIA for his family's sake...
but they assumed he was dead.
then they intercepted a letter he tried to send to his wife.
captain Richard Colby.
he was with Kurtz.
Disneyland.
fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.
Charles Miller Manson ordered the slaughter of all in the home...
anyway as a symbol of protest.
that's really weird, ain't it?
purple haze. Look, man. -Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.
I got a tape from my mom.
rainbow reality, man.
Hey, Chief, get a good whiff.
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.
she pictures me at home having a beer watching TV.
Hey, Lance, man. -Oh, hot potato, hot potato.
I'm so glad you decided to join the navy.
Eva's not sure she can have a relationship with me, you know.
here I am, 1 3, 000 fucking miles away...
trying to keep a relationship with my ass.
that's much more than I can say for some of your friends.
if this tape is any good...I will have Dad and the family -send you a tape of their own. -Hey, Lance.
there! Over there!
there. Over there!
chef, check out Clean!
captain, he's hit. Clean's hit.
Lance! -Where'd the dog go?
Lance! They got Clean.
Where's the dog? We gotta go back and get the dog.
Hey, Clean. Hey.
Bubba, you can't die, you fucker!
and so I'm hoping that--pretty soon
not too soon--but pretty soon
I'll have a lot of grandchildren to love and spoil.
and then when your wife get 'em back, she'll be mad with me.
even Aunt Jessie and Mama...
will come to celebrate your coming home.
granny and Dad are trying to get enough money to get you a car...
but don't tell 'em because that's our secret.
anyhow, do the right thing...
stay out of the way of the bullets...
and bring your heinie home all in one piece...
because we love you very much.
love, Mom.
clean.
hold on.
throw me the glasses.
Lance, take a 1 6 on the bow.
chef. Chef. On the 60.
fuck me.
Lance.

cover the captain. Lance.
they're French. They're French.
pick up that weapon! Pick it up! Pick it up!
stand fast. Captain.
all right, you men. Put down your weapons.
we lost one of our men.
we French always pay respect to the dead of our allies.
you're all welcome.
my name is Hubert DeMarais.
this is my family's plantation.
it has been such for 70 years.
and it will be such until we are all dead.
captain, accept the flag of Tyrone Miller On behalf of a grateful nation.
this food is really wonderful, isn't it?
the wine, the sauces.
I can't believe it.
Hey, can I speak with the chef?
the chef speak only Vietnamese.
no kidding? He cooks like this and he can't even speak French?
Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.
Lance.
this is Baudelaire.
it's a very cruel poem for children.
but they need it, 'cause life sometimes is very cruel.
as you can see.
attack repels by the family.
just for this war.
Vietcong, 58.
north Vietnamese, 1 2.
south Vietnamese, 1 1 .
americans, six?
Yes. Well, there were perhaps mistakes.
may I present Captain Willard.
he is of a paratroop regiment.
Madame Sarrault. -Captain.
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. It was just a little story...
about Paris and people starving during the war.
they are all around the table, and there was a silence and somebody say...
an angel is passing by. "
so somebody said, " Let's eat it. "
how long can you possibly stay here?
we stay forever.
no, no. I mean...
why don't you go back home to France?
back home?
I mean, this is our home, Captain.
－Sooner or later, you're-- －No.
you don't understand our mentality
the French offiIcer mentality!
at first, we lose in Second World War.
I don't say that you Americans win, but we lose.
Oh, Papa
in Dien Bien Phu, we lose. In Algeria, we lose.
in Indochina, we lose!
but here we don't lose!
this piece of earth, we keep it.
we will never lose it. Never!
you Americans.
in 1 945, yeah...
after the Japanese war, your President Roosevelt didn't want the French people to stay in Indochina.
So...you Americans implant the Vietminh.
what's he mean? -Yeah, that's true.
the Vietcong were invented by the Americans.
the Americans?
and now you take the French place...
and the Vietminh fiIght you.
and what can you do?
nothing.
absolutely nothing.
the Vietnamese are very intelligent.
you never know what they think.
the Russian ones who help them,
come and give us their money.
we are all Communists. Chinese, give us guns. We are all brothers. "
they hate the Chinese!
maybe they hate the American less than the Russian and the Chinese.
I mean, if tomorrow the Vietnamese are Communists...
they will be Vietnamese Communists.
and this is something that you never understood, you American.
I don't know.
maybe in the future we can make something with the Vietminh.
don't you understand?
the VC say, " Go away. Go away. "
that's fiInish for all the white people in Indochina.
if you're French, American, that's all the same.
'go. " They want to forget you.
look, Captain.
look, this is the truth.
an egg.
the white left...
but the yellow stays!
when I was in Saigon, I spoke to an American politician.
he explained it very well. He said, Look.
yesterday, it was Korea. Today, Vietnam.
tomorrow, Thailand, the Philippines...
then maybe Europe.
come on. Why not Europe?
look what happened in Czechoslovakia recently.
even before Second World War
americans knew exactly what was going on.
they don't want that shit to take over! Lefevre!
all you white people are shit.
they are fighting--fighting for freedom.
freedom? Bullshit.
french bullshit. American bullshit.
Dien Bien Phu, that serious.
all soldiers know they are already dead.
you know anything about Dien Bien Phu?
Yeah, I know. -No, you don't.
not really.
Dien Bien Phu was an error. A military mistake.
a mistake? A voluntary mistake!
voluntary!
all the soldiers knew.
we knew we would be dead.
the generals and the colonels believe it's impossible for the Viets...
to get the cannon up there in the mountains.
but they do.
then they wait for the rain to come.
when it comes, no airplane can fly there.
and our paratroopers jump at 90 meters.
I mean, you know, 90 meters--70 meters.
I mean, that's crazy.
no army in the world can do that.
and they only do that to be dead with their friends.
the French Army was sacrifiIced.
SacrifiIced by the politicians safe at home.
they put the army in an impossible situation where they couldn't win.
the students are marching in Paris protesting, demonstrating.
they stab the soldiers in their back.
the soldier would open the grenade, it wouldn't work.
a piece of paper would fall
union of French Women. " We are for the Viets. "
traitors! Communist traitors at home.
Dien Bien Phu, okay.
the French is shit, huh?
no one care. No one want
why don't you Americans learn from us, from our mistakes?
mon Dieux, with your army, your strength your power, you could win if you want to!
you can win.
you know, I'm sure we can make something here.
I'm sure about it, you know?
I never do something wrong to the people here.
that's right, but the Communist at home have never been traitors.
capitaine, good night.
he was a Socialist, you know.
I know that we can stay.
I know that we can stay. We can.
you know, we always helped the people.
we work with the people.
so we can be friends, we are agreed.
see, Captain, when my grandfather and my uncle's father came here...
there was nothing--Nothing.
the Vietnamese were nothing.
so we worked hard...
the rubber from Brazil, and then plant it here.
we took the Vietnamese, work with them...
make something--something out of nothing.
so when you ask me why we want to stay here, Captain...
we want to stay here because it's ours it belongs to us. It keeps our family together.
I mean, we fight for that.
while you Americans, you are fighting for...
the biggest nothing in history.
I'm sorry, Captain.
I will see if your men need any help to repair your boat...
so that you can go on with your war.
I apologize for my family, Captain.
we have all lost much here.
Hubert--his wife and two sons.
and I have lost a husband.
I understand.
you are tired of the war.
I can see it in your face.
was the same in the eyes of the soldiers of our war.
we called them " Les Soldats Perdus-- "
the Lost Soldiers.
if you like, we can have some cognac.
no. I...
I have to--to see about my men and
the war will be still here tomorrow.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I noticed you had no wine at dinner.
no, I don't drink wine.
I do like Cognac, but I don't want any now. Thank you.
well...
then I--I must drink alone.
will you go back after the war to America?
no.
then you're like us--your home is here.
do you know why you can never step into the same river twice?
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.
I used to prepare a pipe for my husband.
twas the morphine he took for the wounds he suffered in his heart.
he would rage and he would cry, my lost soldier.
and I said to him,
there are two of you. Don't you see?
one that kills and one that loves. "
and he said to me...
I don't know whether I'm an animal or a god.
but you are both.
you want more?
all that matters is that you're alive.
you are alive, Captain.
that's the truth.
there are two of you, don't you see?
one that kills...and one that loves.
can't see nothing. We stoppin'.
you're not authorized to stop this boat, Chief.
I said I can't see a thing,
captain. I'm stopping this boat.
I ain't riskin' no more lives.
I'm in command here, goddamn it.
you'll do what I say.
you see anything, Chef?
why don't they fucking attack, man?
watch it over here, Chief.
got a stump.
Lance, On the fifties.
he was close.
he was real close.
I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him...
as if the boat were being sucked upriver...
and the water was flowing backinto thejungle.
whatever was going to happen...
it wasn't going to be the way they called it backin Nha Trang.
arrows! -Fire!
chef, open up! Fire!
Lance, fire!
chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit firing.
they're just little toy arrows.
cut it out! Quiet!
chief, tell them to hold their fire!
they're just little sticks.
they're just trying to scare us.
quiet!
you got us into this mess, and now you can't get us out...
you got us into this mess, and now you can't get us out...
do ya?
you son of a bitch! You bastard!
Lance, get the wheel!
you savages! Come and get it! You son of a bitches!
a spear?
my mission is to make it up into Cambodia.
there's a Green Beret colonel up there who's gone insane...
and I'm supposed to kill him.
that's fucking typical! Shit!
fuckin' Vietnam mission!
I'm short and we gotta go up there so you can kill one of our own guys?
that's fucking great!
shit! That's fuckin' crazy.
I mean, I thought you were going in to blow up a bridge...
or some fuckin' railroad tracks or somethin'.
that's all right. -No. No, wait. Wait.
we'll go together, on the boat. We'll go with you.
we'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?
part of me was afraid of what I would find...
and what I would do when I got there.
I knew the risks...
or imagined I knew.
but the thing I felt the most...much stronger than fear...
was the desire to confront him.
just keep movin'.
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.
it's all right! It's all right! It's all been approved!
I ain't comin' in there! Them bastards attacked us!
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man. Zap 'em with your siren.
there's mines over there and mines over there too.
and watch out. Those goddamn monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.
Ah, that's a pretty one. Move it right in towards me.
I'm an American. Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.
Hi. American. American civilian. It's all right.
and you got the cigarettes. And that's what I've been dreaming about.
Chelf.
who are you?
who are you?
I'm a photojournalist.
I've covered the war since '64.
I've been in Laos, Cambodia and 'Nam.
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing. This boat is a mess, man.
who are all these people?
Yeah, well, they think you've come to
to take him away. And I hope that isn't true.
take who away?
him! Col. Kurtz.
these are all his children, man, as far as you can see.
hell, man, out here we're all his children.
could we talk to Col. kurtz?
Hey, man. You don't talk to the colonel.
well, you listen to him.
the man's enlarged my mind.
he's a poet warrior in the classic sense.
I mean, sometimes he'll--Well, you say hello to him, right?
he'll just walk by you and he won't even notice you.
then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say...
do you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'?
if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming you.
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you. "
I'm a little man. I'm a little man. He's a great man.
I should have been a pair of ragged claws...
scuttling across floors of silent seas. "
I mean-- -Stay with the boat.
don't go any--Don't go without me, okay?
I wanna get a picture.
he can be terrible and he can be mean...
and he can be right.
he's fighting the war.
he's a great man.
I mean
I wish I had words, you know. I wish I had words.
I could tell you something like, the other day he wanted to kill me.
something like that.
why'd he want to kill you?
because I took his picture.
he said, If you take my picture again...
I'm gonna kill you. "
and he meant it.
see, just lay cool. Lay cool. Lay back. Dig it.
he gets friendly again. He really does.
but you don't--you don't--you don't judge the colonel.
you don't judge the colonel like an ordinary man.
okay, watch it now. These are Americans. Americans!
you can feel the vibe of this place.
let me take your picture.
Hey, could you hold--Hey, hello. Hello.
could you hold up a minute?
Colby.
the heads.
you're looking at the heads.
I, uh--Sometimes he goes too far.
he's the fiIrst one to admit it.
he's gone crazy. -Wrong, wrong!
if you could have heard the man just two days ago
if you could have heard him then, God
you were gonna call him crazy? -Fuckin' A!
I just wanna talk to him.
well, man, he's gone away.
he's gone away.
he disappeared out in the jungle with his people.
I'll wait for him.
he feels comfortable with his people.
he forgets himself with his people.
he forgets himself.
captain?
maybe we should wait back at the boat.
I think you should-- -Okay, Chef.
we'll go back to the boat for a while.
Yeah, stay with Lance.
this colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
he's worse than crazy. He's evil!
I mean, that's what the man's got set up here, man!
it's fuckin' pagan idolatry. Look around you!
shit, he's loco. -Then you'll help me?
fuckin' A, I'll help you.
I'll do anything to get out of this joint.
good boy.
we could blow all them assholes away.
they're so fuckin' spaced out, they wouldn't even know it.
I ain't afraid of fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.
I used to think if I died in an evil place...
then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to Heaven.
but now, fuck
I mean, I don't care where it goes, as long as it ain't here.
so what do you wanna do? I'll kill the fuck.
get out of here.
I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around, check the place out.
see if I can fiInd the colonel, okay?
well, what do you want me to do?
here. You take the radio...
and if I don't get back by 2200 hours...
you call in the air strike.
air strike?
the code is " Almighty " ...
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-four-seven-one-two.
it's all in there.
everything I saw told me that Kurtz had gone insane.
the place was full of bodies
north Vietnamese, Vietcong, Cambodians.
if I was still alive, it was because he wanted me that way.
it smelled like slow death in there
Malaria...and nightmares.
this was the end of the river, all right.
where are you from, Willard?
I'm from Ohio, sir.
were you born there?
Yes, sir.
whereabouts?
toledo, sir.
how far are you from the river?
the Ohio River, sir?
about 200 miles.
I went down that river once when I was a kid.
there's a place in the river--I can't remember
must've been a gardenia plantation or a flower plantation at one time.
it's all wild and overgrown now.
but for about five miles you'd think that...
heaven just fell on the earth...
in the form of gardenias.
have you ever considered...
any real freedoms?
freedoms from the opinion of others?
even the opinions of yourself?
did they say why, Willard?
why they wanted to terminate my command?
I was sent on a classifiIed mission, sir.
it's no longer classifiIed, is it?
what did they tell you?
they told me...that you had gone...
totally insane...
and that your methods were unsound.
are my methods unsound?
I don't see any method...
at all, sir.
I expected...someone like you.
what did you expect?
are you an assassin?
I'm a soldier.
you're neither.
you're an errand boy sent by grocery clerks...
to collect the bill.
why, huh?
why would a nice guy like you wanna kill a genius?
feeling pretty good, huh?
Why?
do you know
do you know that the man
the man really likes you?
he likes you. He really likes you.
but he's got something in mind for you.
aren't you curious about that?
I'm curious.
I'm very curious.
are you curious?
there's something happening out here, man.
you know something, man. I know something that you don't know.
that's right, Jack.
the man is clear in his mind...
but his soul is mad.
Oh, yeah.
he's dying, I think.
he hates all this. He hates it.
but the man's
he reads poetry out loud, all right?
and a voice
a voice
he likes you 'cause you're still alive.
he's got plans for you.
no, no, I'm not gonna help you. You're gonna help him, man.
you're gonna help him.
I mean, what are they gonna say, man, when he's gone, huh?
cause he dies when it dies, man. When it dies, he dies.
what are they gonna say about him? What are they gonna say?
he was a kind man?
he was a wise man? He had plans? He had wisdom?
bullshit, man!
am I gonna be the one that's gonna set them straight?
look at me. Wrong!
you.
almost eight hours.
I'm asleep.
I'm asleep and dreaming I'm on this shitty boat.
fuck.
has it been eight hours?
hello. Almighty. Almighty.
this is PBR Street Gang. Radio check. Over.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty standing by. Over.

september 22, 1 967.
volume 90 number 1 2.
the War on the Horizon.
the American people may fiInd it hard to believe...
that the US is winning the war in Vietnam.
Nevertheless...
one of the most exhaustive inquiries...
into the status of the conflict yet compiled...
offers considerable evidence that the weight of US power...
two-and-a-half years after the big buildup began...
is beginning to make itself felt.
white House offiIcials maintain the impact of that strength...
may bring the enemy to the point where he could...
simply be unable to continue fighting. "
is this familiar?
because Lyndon Johnson fears that the US public...
is in no mood to accept its optimistic conclusions...
he may never permit the report to be released in full.
even so, he is suffiIciently impressed with the findings...
and suffiIciently anxious to make their conclusions known...
to permit experts who have been working on it...
to talk about it in general terms. "
no date, Time magazine.
sir Robert Thompson...
who led the victory over Communist guerillas in Malaya...
is now a RAND corporation consultant...
recently returned to Vietnam to sound out the situation for President Nixon.
he told the president last week...
that things felt much better...
and smelled much better over there. "
how do they smell to you, soldier?
you'll be free. You'll be under guard.
read these at your leisure.
don't lose them.
don't try to escape. You'll be shot.
we can talk of these things later.
we are the hollow men.
we are the stuffed men...
leaning together at peace filled with straw.
alas, our dried voices when we whisper together...
are quiet and meaningless as wind in dry grass...
or a rat's feet over broken glass in a dry cellar.
he's really out there.
he is really there.
shape without form...
shade without color...
paralyzed force...
gesture without motion. "
do you know what the man's saying?
do you?
this is dialectics.
it's very simple dialectics.
it's one through nine. No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.
you can't travel in space.
you can't go out into space, you know...
without like, you know, with fractions.
what are you gonna land on? One-quarter? Three-eighths?
what are you gonna do when you go from here to Venus?
that's dialectic physics, okay.
dialectic logic is, there's only love and hate.
you either love somebody or you hate 'em.
mutt!
you mutt.
this is the way the fucking world is.
look at this fucking shit we're in, man!
not with a bang. A whimper.
and with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, Jack.
on the river,
I thought that the minute I looked at him...
I'd know what to do.
but it didn't happen.
I was in there with him for days.
not under guard.
I was free.
but he knew I wasn't going anywhere.
he knew more about what I was going to do than I did.
if the generals backin Nha Trang could see what I saw...
would they still want me to kill him?
more than ever, probably.
and what would his people back home want if they ever learned...
just how far from them he'd really gone?
he broke from them...
and then he broke from himself.
I'd never seen a man so broken up and ripped apart.
I've seen the horrors
horrors that you've seen.
but you have no right to call me a murderer.
you have a right to kill me.
you have a right to do that.
but you have no right to judge me.
it's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means.
horror.
horror has a face.
and you must make a friend of horror.
horror and moral terror...
are your friends.
if they are not...
then they are enemies to be feared.
they are truly enemies.
I remember when I was with Special Forces.
seems a thousand centuries ago.
we went into a camp to inoculate some children.
we'd left the camp after we had inoculated the children for polio.
and this old man came running after us, and he was crying.
he couldn't say.
we went back there...
and they had come and hacked off...
every inoculated arm.
there they were, in a pile
a pile of...
little arms.
and I remember...
I-I--I cried. I wept like some grandmother.
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.
and I want to remember it. I never want to forget it.
I never want to forget.
and then I realized...
like I was shot
like I was shot with a diamond
a diamond bullet right through my forehead.
and I thought, My God, the genius of that.
the genius.
the will to do that.
perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.
and then I realized...
they were stronger than me because they could stand it.
these were not monsters. These were men
trained cadres.
these men who fought with their hearts...
who have families, who have children...
who are fiIlled with love...
that they had the strength
the strength to do that.
if I had ten divisions of those men...
then our troubles here would be over very quickly.
you have to have men...
who are moral and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill...
without feeling, without passion...
without judgment--without judgment.
because it's judgment that defeats us.
I worry that my son...
might not understand what I've tried to be.
and if I were to be killed, Willard...
I would want someone to go to my home...
and tell my son everything.
everything I did. Everything you saw.
because there's nothing that I detest more than...
the stench of lies.
and if you understand me, Willard, you
you will do this for me.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty. Over.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty standing by. Over.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty standing by.
how do you copy?
they were gonna make me a major for this...
and I wasn't even in their fuckin'army anymore.
everybody wanted me to do it.
him most of all.
I felt like he was up there...
waiting for me to take the pain away.
he just wanted to go out like a soldier...
standing up.
not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade.
even the jungle wanted him dead.
and that's who he really took his orders from anyway.
we train young men to drop fiIre on people...
but their commanders...
won't allow them to write " fuck " on their airplanes because it's obscene.
the horror.
the horror.
calling PBRStreet Gang.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty.
do you read me? Over.
PBRStreet Gang?
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty
the horror.
the horror.
Clark, I know hunting down zoners is your top priority, but if you haven't found anything in south america, we still have a situation back here in kansas we need to deal with.
no, he'll be here in 15 minutes.
okay. Great.
I'll see you in a few.
Dr. Casselli.
you're early.
you are annoyingly persistent, miss sullivan.
I've already told you I don't know anything.
don't sell yourself short, doctor.
I think you're a very knowledgeable man.
in the last few months, over a dozen patients have been transferred out of the high-security wing at belle reve.
I believe that's your signature on all the paperwork.
patients are transferred in and out of mental facilities all the time.
even ones that exhibit unusual abilities?
where are they transferred to?
is luthorcorp involved?
does this have anything to do with 33. 1?
okay. I'll take that as a "no comment.
I didn't want any of this.
but it was so much money.
Chloe? You okay?
Yeah.
just in the nick of time, as always.
it wasn't me. He was already down when I got here.
what?
well, if it wasn't you, then who
he's open! Pass the ball!
pass the
Oh! What's the matter with you, man?
still too slow, stretch.
Bart.
he got away from you?
I thought you were the fastest man alive.
he saved your life, which is more than I can say.
Oh, come on, clark. It wasn't your fault.
even with all your powers, you can't be everywhere at once.
I have to be.
I'm the only one who can round up the prisoners from the phantom zone and stop lex from experimenting on people with abilities.
what did you find out from casselli about 33. 1?
nothing, and I'm not going to.
casselli was in and out of prison before the ink could dry on his fingerprints.
how'd he get out so fast?
I don't know, but a luthorcorp lawyer paid casselli a visit right before his release.
Lex.
casselli could be stashed halfway around the world by now.
I'll get in touch with lionel. Maybe he can tell us something.
I'll keep sifting through my luthorcorp intel.
maybe we'll get lucky, and I'll come up with a few bread crumbs.
Hey, gorgeous. What's up? You miss me?
I'm bart allen. We had a moment on the town last time I was here.
two years ago, before you had a boyfriend.
Oh! Right! Wow.
it's good to see you again, bart.
I'll see you around.
muy caliente.
knock it off.
what's with the spanish?
I just grabbed lunch down in mexico, man.
they got this burrito down there - el intestine-o buster.
you got to take a run down there with me to try one.
what are you doing here, bart?
I'm hanging out with my amigo, man. What's it look like?
that's what I'm trying to find out.
last time you blew through town, you stole my dad's wallet then swiped a priceless artifact from lex. You nearly got yourself killed.
Yeah. Yeah, those were the days, huh?
Yeah, all right. Look, man,
I already told you, things are different now, okay?
I mean, back then, I needed a super-kick in the butt, and you laid it on me, and ever since then, there's been no more stealing for this gringo, I swear.
am I really supposed to just buy that?
I could squirt out some tears if that'll help.
no, but the truth might.
what were you doing at the daily planet?
I saw chloe-licious had a byline a while back.
and I was in town on business, figured I ought to check it out.
what kind of business?
I'm a courier. I pick things up. I drop them off.
Lickety-split. Don't have a fit.
all right. Look, man, whatever. You don't trust me. That's fine.
okay, I'll be gonebefore you can even blink.
I don't know.
I can still blinkpretty fast.
mexico, huh? Want to go get that burrito?
Excelente.
now, that is what I call a three-martini lunch.
it wasa four-martini lunch if you include the onethat you spilled on my shirt.
right.
well, how am I ever going tomake it up to you?
I don't know. Because, uh...
it's my favorite shirt.
well, then, I think we shouldget it into the laundry so that it doesn't stain.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
I got to take this.
go ahead.
give me five minutes.
I, uh...
you know, what I had in mind is gonna take a little longerthan five minutes.
rain check?
sure.
I'll just put it nextto the rest of the umbrellas you keep handing me.
Lois
I mean, is it just me or is this relationshipall interruptus and no coitus?
you're always running off just when thingsstart getting interesting, and I like being interested -a lot.
Yeah. I know. You're right.
it's, uh... it's not fair to you.
I think we should takea break.
you mean like, what...
see other people?
uh, well, okay. Yeah, I mean, if that's what you want.
I was actually thinkingmore along the lines of taking a vacation...
together.
Really?
Yeah, really.
no rushing outin the middle of the good stuff?
no. None.
it'll be you, me, and...
Monte carlo?
there's just a few thingsthat I do need to take care of before we go, and I think once we get
God, you're good at that.
I'll start packing. - Okay.
Bye.
game ON
I need to talk to you. You alone?
just meand my shadow, dad.
Lana's in paris with nell, shopping for a wedding dress.
that's goodshe's out of the country consideringwhat's happening.
look, if this is aboutdr. Casselli
casselli? He's the least of our worries.
another luthorcorp facilityhas been hit. That's six.
each one of them hassome connection with 33. 1.
the only thinghoused in those facilities was peripheral research.
all the vital data isstill secure in the mainframe.
how long do you think beforethat location is compromised?
if it ever became publicthat luthorcorp is experimenting on peoplewith abilities
it won'T.
what's this?
a single framepulled off a security camera from one of the break-ins.
whoever is responsible has the ability to move fasterthan a speeding bullet.
such a unique individual would make an interestingtest subject to add to 33. 1, don't you think?
what do you plan to do?
protect our investment.
come on. I'll walk you out.
Yeah, I got it.
meet me at the rendezvous.
Hey, are we gonna do this or are you gonna lurkin the shadows all night?
just being careful.
after all, I'm not as fast as you.
Clark.
I was, uh, just thinking about you.
you got a funny wayof showing it.
I've left youhalf a dozen messages.
I'm sorry. I've been preoccupied.
helping that doctorfrom belle reve get out of jail.
Clark, my involvementwith belle reve is past history.
but it appearsthat you still have a very active interestin breaking into luthorcorp.
where was this taken?
mexico - the luthorcorpprocessing plant.
if you're going to continueplaying games like this, you should be more careful.
this isn't me.
no?
who is it, then?
God, mrs. K, thank you so much. This was so good.
where do you put it all?
you eat more than clark, and he's twice your size.
Yeah, well, you know, I burn a lot of calories.
well, there's plenty morein the fridge.
I have to runto a meeting.
would you mindcleaning up?
Yeah, anything for you, mrs. K.
it's niceto have you here, bart. I hope you stay longerthis time.
Hey, what's up, man? You just missed a killer spread.
you can cut the act.
I know about luthorcorp and the break-ins by somebodywho's as fast as me.
Yeah. Faster, actually.
you know what's funny? I actually believed your storyabout how I changed your life.
look, it's not a story, clark, okay?
really, I'm not the same guy.
you stole from lex before. You're stealing from him again.
what's the difference?
it's just - ugh! -It's complicated.
I'm a smart guy. Explain it to me.
I can'T.
why not? I thought we were amigos.
we are.
then tell me why you're stealingfrom luthorcorp.
I JUST I CAN't
I'll find outfor myself, then.
look, I'm sorry I can't tell youall my secrets, clark.
okay? I thought a guy like youwould understand.
I know it's justa vacation, but
what? Vacation? No, vacation is palm springs.
Monte carlois a fairy tale.
Yeah, hopefullywithout prince charming having a disappearing actevery five minutes.
um, I think you'll be keepinghis full attention, lois.
Yeah, you know, I'd better. It's not like I govictoria's secret for anybody.
what do you think? Should I have gone with the blk lace?
no.
something tells me greenis definitely his color.
Hey, chloe.
God. Smallville. Learn how to knock.
what if I'd been naked?
Lois is jetting offto monte carlo with oliver.
Oliver?
I'll send you a postcardif I'm not too busy.
no, lois, you should, um...
get a couple new bikinis.
good idea. Thanks, smallville.
maybe it wasn'tsuch a good idea to help oliverkeep his secret from her.
what, that he's the green arrow?
no offense, but you weren'texactly honest with lana about your secret, either.
look how that ended up.
maybe all keeping secretsdoes sometimes is force you to lieto the people you care about.
are we stilltalking about oliver?
the guy who saved youat the planet
he didn't exactly get away. It's bart.
what? Wait a minute. Bart can superspeed, too?
he's actually a lot fasterthan I am. That's the truth.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
it's fine. You were protecting him. It's okay.
I mean, if anyone gets it, it's me.
but why are yououting him now?
I think he's headed for trouble, and I need to find him.
can you gps his cellphone?
Yeah, I can try. Do you have his number?
he broke into a luthorcorp plantdown in mexico.
now I think lexis on to him.
if he tries to break intoanother facility...
no good. His phone must be off.
what about call history? Can you pull up a record?
legally? Absolutely not.
there's over a dozen callsto that number in the last 24 hours.
let's see who's onthe other end.
Artemis global consortium? Never heard of them.
it's as subsidiaryof J. L. International, which is a satellitecompany currently orbiting...
queen industries?
it's oliver.
he's using bartto attack luthorcorp.
I'm in.
not so fast now, are you?
Oliver.
look, clark, whatever's gotyour tighty whities in a bunch, now is not the time.
Where's bart? I saw his phone records.
I know he's working for you.
not for me. Working with me.
there's a difference.
it's not gonna matter whenhe ends up in jail or worse.
Yeah, you don't knowwhat you're talking about.
I know how muchyou hate lex.
is that whyyou recruited bart
to help withyour little vendetta?
no. To stop 33. 1.
you know about 33. 1?
why didn't you tell mewhat you were up to?
Clark, do you check in with me every time you run offto save the world?
Oh, that's right. For a second there, I forgot.
you like to wait for troubleto show up on your doorstep.
that's not true.
then why haven't you doneanything to stop 33. 1?
I was busywith another problem.
what could be more urgentthan lex luthor developing an armyof superfreaks, clark?
that's what he's doing.
he's starting a war.
what have you found out?
not enough.
last nightbart infiltrated a place that was supposed to housethe mainframe for 33. 1.
that's the last timeI heard from him.
so I reconnedthe target this morning.
the placehad been stripped clean. Everything's gone.
the whole thingwas a setup.
Lex has bart.
we have to find him.
my team's already on it. - Your team?
not everybodyflies solo, kent.
morning, sunshine.
I know you.
you've stolen from mebefore.
I want a lawyer.
and I want a ponytail.
disappointment abounds.
who do you work for?
what you see is what you get, there, goldilocks.
you're a low-level thief.
swiping corporate dataisn't your style.
now, tell mewho you're working for, and this won't have to getunpleasant.
all right.
all right.
I work for a guycalled mr. Kiss-my-butt.
would you like meto introduce you?
the floor of your cellhas been outfitted with pressure platesdesigned to track movement.
stop in one placefor even a millisecond after I activate them, and you fry.
last chance.
well, maybe you'll feelmore talkative when you get tiredof running.
Aah!
A. C.Checkthe luthorcorp manifests.
gotcha.
how long have you guysbeen working together?
I joined upabout six months ago.
Ollie and bart had alreadybeen doing their thing.
what about your girlfriend -katherine?
dude, don't even go there.
she gave it her best shot.
but with all this hardwarein me...
I'm sorry, victor.
Ollie found me. I was living on the streets.
he gave me a warm meal, roof over my head...
and a reason to go on living.
did he just saysomething nice about me?
maybe he's startingto rust.
A. C.How'd you fallinto all this?
I got into a little troublesinking a whaler off the coast of japan.
a little trouble? That'swhat you're gonna go with?
Ollie had to save your scalybutt from getting filleted.
I would have gottenout of it.
before or after they packed youinto a thousand little tin cans?
well, at least he wouldhave been dolphin-safe.
fish jokes.
that's all I ever getare fish jokes.
so how's lois doing, man? Is she all right?
I think you'd have to askyour boss.
now is not the time. We need to focuson locating bart.
and how exactly did you get himinvolved in this?
he's never beenmuch of a team player.
looks like you two havesomething in common, huh?
actually, I was out on patrolin star city one night, and I came across bart. He was helping himselfto a free meal.
I could tell he was a good kid, you know?
he just neededa little direction, so I offered him a job.
look where that got him.
I underestimated lex.
it won't happen again.
I've compiled a listof all luthorcorp holdings within a 100-mile radius.
Bart could be heldin any one of those facilities.
that's a lot of real estateto cover.
I think I know someonewho can help us narrow it down.
Victor stone and arthur curryare working for him, too?
Yeah, oliver's been busy.
is there anythingin your luthorcorp intel that can help us find outwhere bart's being held?
I don't know.
uh... wait.
when I had my feelers outfor dr. Casselli, I managed to shake loosesome internal documents.
in the last few days, there's been a flurryof equipment transfers to the ridge facilitieson the outskirts of metropolis.
doesn't luthorcorpmove equipment all the time?
this isn't just a coupleof forklifts, clark.
half a ton of lead shielding, electrical pressure plates, more than $20 millionworth of equipment to measure high-velocityparticles.
Bart. Take everythingand bring it to oliver.
me? Clark
I can get to the ridgefaster myself.
I can't let anythinghappen to bart.
Mr. Queen, it's chloe sullivan. Clark sent me.
Where's clark?
he went to rescue bart.
he told you about bart?
we trust each other. Clark tells me everything
well, almost everything.
I did have to figure out about your green-leather fetishon my lonesome.
don't worry. I didn't say anything to lois.
although, you mightwant to consider
Hey, let's just stick tothe main plot, there, sidekick.
so, what do you got?
hopefully a solid leadon bart.
where are victor and A. C?
guess we're not that good at the whole "secret" partof this yet.
Yeah, but you're great atgetting caught by the villain.
anyway, I think bart'sbeing held at a placecalled the ridge facility.
that's down by the docks.
it's on our listof possible 33. 1 targets.
all right, boys. You know the drill. Let's gear up and get out.
Oh, no.
what now?
lead shielding. This isn't just for bart.
I think the ridge facility'sbeing used to refine meteor rock.
Clark's in trouble.
restricted
green arrow to watchtower. We're in position.
okay, there should be a securityaccess panel near the east door.
according to this schematic, you need to very carefullyrewire the sys
or...
I could just jack in andshut the whole perimeter down.
you can do that?
queen industries upgrade.
Accessingperimeter security.
perimeter neutralized.
Aquaman, you're up.
perimeter breached. Proceeding to target.
you'd make one hellof a can opener.
you'd look good on a bag of green beans.
all right, we're in. Which way?
the refinement vault's100 meters southwest.
still no word from clark.
if he's in there, we'll get him out. Let's go.
you've gota different mission.
you're the boss, robin hood.
what mission? What are you doing?
watchtower to green arrow. What's your status?
Switchingto silent running.
stand byfor instructions.
Aquaman, do your thing.
Hey. You're not supposed to be here.
neither am I.
come on.
I'm all right. - You sure?
green arrow to watchtower. Boy scout'sout of the woods.
boy scout?
if you hadn't ran off, you couldhave picked your code name.
you don't want to playfor the team, that's fine.
point taken. Where's bart?
impulse. " He didn't get to pickhis own code name either.
watchtower will guide you towhere he's probably being held.
what are yougonna be doing?
what I do best.
watchtower to boy scout. Let's find impulse.
cyborg to aquaman. Where the hell are you, fish stick?
dude, what took you so long?
nice.
but, please, put a shirt on.
I swim fasterwhen I'm naked.
I bet you do.
you're lucky I still gotmy pants on.
impulse located.
Bart, you okay?
muy bueno, amigo.
I don't care. I want a level-one lockdown.
no one gets in or out.
little late for that.
you got 10 minutesto clear your people out of here before I blow this placeoff the map.
you.
you remember. I'm touched.
well, it's a little hardto forget.
last time we met, you put an arrow in my chest.
you put a bullet in mine. Bygones?
go to hell.
you first.
can you superspeed?
Yeah, I just - I need a minuteto catch my breath.
you know what? You're gonnahave to catch it later.
Aquaman, cyborg, rendezvous alpha confirmed.
we're on the move.
watchtower, have all luthor'speople cleared the building?
the last heat signaturesare moving away from the north.
wait a second. What are you doing?
what do you thinkI'm doing?
you want more of your friendsto end up in here?
Yeah, I'm voting noon that one.
watchtower, are you sureeveryone's out of the building?
100% positive.
all right. Let's do it.
have the jet fueledand ready. I want to be in the airas soon as possible.
Hey.
I hope your bird's gotsome serious lift, 'cause this thingweighs a ton.
aren't you packed yet?
Where's your stuff?
Lois, um...
don't even think about sayingwhat I think you're gonna say.
I'm sorry. I, um, I have to go awayon business.
postpone it.
it's not that simple.
nothing with you ever is.
you're like two completelydifferent people.
there's the charming, romantic guy that I fell in love with, and then there'sthis other guy who can't stick aroundin one place long enoughto see what he's missing.
ever sincemy parents died...
...I've jumped aroundfrom city to city, from continentto continent.
and... in all those years...
...not once have I regrettedleaving anyone.
but then I met you.
then stay.
I can'T.
because there are more importantthings in this world than what I want...
and what I love.
I hope somedayI can explain why.
don't expect meto be waiting around for that when you get back.
I'm not coming back, lois.
at least not anytime soon.
I'm sorry.
I never wanted to hurt you.
well, you finally got aroundto it anyway, didn't you?
this is the... the moment, right?
the moment that I'm gonna regretfor the rest of my life, isn't it?
Yes.
I loved you.
Bart allen - gone. He escaped.
a multimillion-dollarinstallation destroyed.
33. 1 irrevocablycompromised.
but, son, at least you found out the jolly green archerand his extraordinary cohorts
they're not yourrun-of-the-mill adversaries.
which is exactly whywe have to continue with 33. 1.
if terroristslike green arrow are recruiting peoplewith abilities, the only way to protect freedomand democracy is to fight firewith fire.
freedom and democracy?
well, I hadn't realizedyour goals were quite so lofty.
well, there's a lotthat escapes your attention in your declining years, dad, but not mine.
the security footage from the ridge facilitywas destroyed.
however, several guards describeone of green arrow's men as someone that soundedremarkably like clark kent.
Clark. Impossible.
a word that always seems to popup when talking about him, doesn't it?
Lex, it was not clark.
how can you be so sure?
because I was having dinnerwith him last night when all this happened.
Martha made pot roast with new potatoesand tiny little baby carrots.
it was delicious. Clark had three helpings.
don't worry, son.
you still haveplenty of enemies out there plotting your downfall.
okay. Thanks.
so the daily planetis running with the story that a gas explosion destroyedthe vacant luthorcorp building down by the docks.
vacant?
looks like the luthor cover-upmachine is in full swing.
well, at leastwe got bart out before lex ran himinto an early grave.
come on. No worries. I had plenty of juice left.
could have fooled me, the way you cleaned outmama kent's fridge.
that's 'cause I like to stayfueled up.
just in case I need to, uh, spring into action.
I still have a boyfriend.
Yeah. Well, a man can dream, can't he?
now you knowwhy we call him impulse.
impulse, cyborg, aquaman, green arrow. What do you guys callyour team?
I don't know. I've been thinkingthat we need something cool.
we need something like -like
I was thinking about somethingwith the word "justice" in it.
after all, that's what lexis gonna get a big dose of.
Victor and A. C. Were able tohack into the 33. 1 mainframe before we blewthe building.
that wasyour other mission.
haven't met the computer yetI couldn't crack wide open.
what did you guysfind out?
that lex isn't satisfied playingin his own backyard anymore.
Luthorcorp is starting updivisions of 33. 1 all across the globe.
wherever there's evidenceof people with abilities, there'll be laboratoriesto do experiments on them.
we can't let that happen.
we won'T.
gentlemen, our first target is a large facilityon the island of corto maltese.
you guys know the drill. Wheels up in 30 minutes. Get your gear.
you coming, amigo?
Yeah, you got to comewith us, man.
we could usethe big guns.
they're right, you know - you'dbe a major asset to the team.
I want to be a part of this, guys. I really do.
but...
that problem I told you about -the one that I caused
I have to take careof that first.
this isn't the endof the story, clark.
this is just the beginning.
Chloe.
come on, boys.
let's go save the world.
thanks for the advice...
but I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
what happened?
I told her I was sick of her bullshit.
you what?
Ellen, you're a first-year associate.
when patty was my age, do you think she would have tolerated a boss like her?
no.
then why should I?
was this about the case?
sort of.
I uncovered some evidence on my own...
but patty was more interested in putting me in my place than what I found.
I see, mm-hmm.
she says it's all about the case, but it's not.
it's about her and her mind games.
Yes.
I want the clients to win their case, but...
I'm not going to be patty's punching bag.
Oh, you'll bounce back.
which is why I'm here, mr. Nye.
I need a job.
the law will always be here, ellen.
but, um, your wedding is coming up, isn't it?
Yes.
you know, I made similar mistakes early in my career.
never took a honeymoon.
don't let your life pass you by.
babe, this is a nightmare.
what is?
the seating arrangement.
it's more complicated than the bar exam.
can I sit your cousin jake next to heather?
why are you always trying to pimp heather out, huh?
I just thought, you know, they both...
they both love hiking...
and narcotics.
they have lots to talk about.
how'd it go with nye?
he wouldn't give me a job.
he told me to take a vacation.
I love this man.
all right, I will see you later.
okay? - Okay.
Hello, david.
may I come in?
do you want to call me later?
Yeah. I will.
I was wondering when you would show up.
you impressed me with this.
I wasn't trying to.
just take the information and use it.
it's all very intriguing, but how does it help our case?
george moore was heading up the sec investigation into frobisher's company, but according to a former sec investigator...
Laura watkins.
I met with her.
she believed that moore was making a big show of wanting to take down frobisher, but behind the scenes he was torpedoing the investigation.
and all the rest of this
the hotel records, the rental car receipts, a flight manifest...
all show that george moore was in jacksonville, florida the weekend before frobisher sold his stock.
Moore drove down to palm beach to tip off frobisher.
it's a nice theory.
no proof.
use it anyway.
put pressure on moore.
to do what?
get frobisher to settle.
I could never understand why moore leaked arlington, but now it makes perfect sense.
he must be afraid of what would come out in a trial.
Moore wants the whole case to go away, and if he knows that you're closing in on him...
he'll give us more dirt we can use against frobisher.
so...
we need to go back to moore.
I think so.
and you're the only lawyer in my firm he'll talk to.
it's a nice apartment.
isn't it?
go back to moore.
and...
of course you can have your job back.
I don't want it.
but I'll talk to moore.
I want you to win this case.
our court date-- six weeks, folks.
Tom's running point, so if he needs you to do something, do it.
exhibits, witness prep.
it is deadline time.
Felicia, do you have the expert list?
you'll get it tomorrow.
that's it.
make your mothers proud.
where was ellen this morning? - I don't know.
maybe she wasn't feeling well.
Tom, half the office saw her storm out the other day.
did patty fire her?
just focus on the case.
everyone's talking about it.
what are we supposed to tell them? - Whatever you want.
tell them ellen's dead.
just get me the goddamn expert list.
I hope she was fired.
I never liked her.
Hey.
what are you doing here?
I thought you could use some lunch.
what do we got here?
a nice filet, some asparagus, and some blackberry cobbler.
sweetie, this is stupendous.
I finished my meetings this morning, and i just realized how much I missed you.
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
this case has just taken over my life.
they all do, ray, but this one...
this one's different.
I worry about you.
you're so quiet these days.
what?
you never accused me of that before.
well, it's true.
soon as the case is over, I'll be a regular ol' chatterbox again.
well, that'll be nice.
we'll take a few days, go see your sister in tacoma.
I'll believe that when I see it.
I promise.
sit, sit, eat.
Oh, that smells good.
200251
more wine?
why not?
we're going to be closing soon, so...
looks like I'm your last customer.
I suppose I just lost track of the time.
you're always coming in here with work. What do you do?
I'm an attorney.
you know, I don't believe I've ever caught your name.
ray.
a blackout?
you were probably still in kindergarten.
this was 1977, the very first week I arrived.
an auspicious debut. Shit.
guess when I got here.
when?
last september.
you don't say. Yeah.
before or after?
just before.
it almost made my change my mind, but then I thought...
if I leave now...
they win. Right.
I probably should have left, though.
Why's that?
I don't know, I...
I just can'T...
get going, you know?
I live in a shithole, and i barely make enough to pay my rent.
why did you decide to move here in the first place?
I'll try anything once, I guess.
Oh, I'm sorry.
that's my wife.
you're married?
never seen her; you never bring her in.
Oh, I come in here to work, clear my head.
you like being an attorney?
I like the relationship between attorney and client.
there's an intimacy there, a trust.
someone puts himself in your hands.
and you like that.
I do.
what the hell are you doing here?
Oh, uh, a couple downstairs said the ceiling was dripping.
just, um...
checking for a leak.
and the lamp?
noticed a bulb was out.
does ellen know that you're here?
no.
Patty hewes told me to extra special care of you.
next time, you call me.
don't ever do this again.
6 DAYS LATER
you have 57 new messages.
Patty, it's tom.
it's tom.
I'm in rome now. I'm worried about you...
it's tom...
Yeah, mom, I'm up at henry'S. Everything's fine...
I don't know how to tell you this.
I just got a call from hollis nye.
somehow, ellen's in jail.
I don't know how to tell you this.
I just got a call from hollis nye.
somehow, ellen's in jail.
she was arrested for killing david.
how was sawgrass?
I'm sorry?
did you hit the green on 17 or end up in the drink?
depends on when you're talking about.
june, 2002.
you were in jacksonville, florida the weekend before frobisher dumped his stock.
Ah, yes.
I hit the green.
I'm sure you did.
then you drove four hours to palm beach and tipped off frobisher that the sec was about to release a report damning his company's finances.
Frobisher give you a nice kickback?
I was trying to prosecute arthur frobisher.
not according to laura watkins.
look, I don't know what you think...
I think you want this case to be over, and i think that we can help each other.
give us something on frobisher.
and if I don't?
then patty hewes starts looking into you.
your finances, your investments, your bank accounts
anything you have hidden, she'll find it.
I told you, I can't give you frobisher.
but I can give you somebody.
who?
same time, tomorrow night, meet me here.
I'll bring you a present.
Jesus...
you scared me.
you're so cute when you think you're alone. Yeah?
Ugh, I'm living life in reverse.
first breakfast then bed.
what's that?
it's our first wedding gift.
don't get too excited, though. It's from aunt marge and uncle fran.
a garden gnome?
we live in an apartment.
thank god your family has some taste.
what did patty have to say?
she offered me my job back.
what did you say?
I said no.
good.
I don't like having her in our lives.
neither do I.
you want breakfast? - Sure
Aw, no.
who is it?
don't answer it.
but this is the third time she's called this week.
well, we need do something.
we need to talk.
how did it go with judge toomey?
Patty, when are you going to announce ellen's firing?
I'm-I'm-I'm running around the office, avoiding people's questions...
And?
and I'm a partner now, and I need you to treat me like one.
if you have plans for ellen, i need to know them.
there are no plans.
then you should tell the associates that.
Ellen approached a key informant without our knowledge, and she was fired.
people should know that.
go announce it.
thank you.
you're right, you're a partner, i should start treating you like one.
goddamn it, gregory, you had one task.
one task, and you screwed it up.
how was I supposed to know the guy was gonna show up early?
you shouldn't have been in the condo in the first place.
you were supposed to rent it, leave the key, and take a goddamn vacation.
I'm sorry, ray.
but I'm telling you, the girl didn't see anything.
the important thing now is for you to say nothing.
you just forget any of this ever happened, understand?
Yes, I understand.
look, I'm sorry for raising my voice at you...
it's my fault.
I-I screwed up.
I'm the one who sent you down there.
listen.
that gift I gave you, for going down there...
the stock.
do yourself a favor.
sell it tomorrow.
give me a double scotch.
do you believe this?
I'm staying in a hotel room.
I can't be in that house anymore.
you better get me the best goddamn divorce attorney in this city.
of course.
one battle at a time.
thank you, that's enough.
we were right.
about what?
he sold you out.
Arlington...
gregory malina...
it's all him.
so you're meeting with moore again?
Yeah.
he won't give up frobisher, but he's going to give us someone else.
you've got him desperate.
he's trying to make the case go away before it closes in on him.
if moore tipped off frobisher, that's a crime.
why shouldn't we just go after him for that?
because our clients come first.
criminal charges would take precedence.
our case could get pushed another three years.
we'll get there, ellen...
once step at a time.
here.
what's this?
it should hold you over for a few weeks.
I'm not doing this for money.
I know you're not, but take it.
don't be foolish, ellen.
everyone needs to eat.
mom? Yeah.
Oh, hey.
sorry to interrupt.
Michael, this is ellen parsons.
Hi.
nice to meet you, michael.
Yeah, cool.
are you using the car tonight?
me, henry and julius are going to head to foxwoods.
to the casino?
you can't get in.
mom... fake ids?
you guys have a nice night.
she's kind of hot.
where the hell have you been? I've been waiting for over...
are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
here.
I'm sorry you went through that.
I hate these people.
photos link ray fiske to gregory malina, and the documents prove that fiske's guilty of insider trading.
you should be able to use that.
it's blackmail, ellen.
just do what needs to be done.
so mr. Frobisher offered $500 million to settle, and patty hewes turned it down.
at that price, this case should be over.
she's overplaying her hand.
gone and convinced herself that arthur's outburst in that deposition room will be worth more to a jury than it actually is.
my grandfather adored you, ray.
I'm told people thought you were his son.
he was a fine man, an even better mentor.
he'd be tickled pink to see what you've made of yourself, marshall.
we all have the utmost respect here for you, ray.
we truly do.
so I... I won't mince words.
the senior partners have lost confidence in your ability to effectively try this case.
you've got to be kidding me.
and as you know, mr. Frobisher's case bears enormous consequence to the future well-being of this firm.
the partners want me to shadow you from here on out.
you'll consult me on any and all tactical decisions as we move to trial.
look, arthur frobisher is a stubborn man.
stubborn and complicated.
there are complexities to the case that are beyond the normal scope of...
Marshall, I'm sorry, no offense, but I'm going to have to talk this over with amos.
it's been decided.
I'll be looking over your shoulder every step of the way, so...
you'll turn over everything you've got, get me up to speed by the end of the week.
what do you have there, girl?
let me see.
come on.
come on, girl, open up.
don't you just love dogs?
Yeah.
they're like people.
only without the bullshit.
go play, girl, go.
client reps rethink the offer?
what's this?
it's our counter.
the wealthy patron who paid gregory malina's way down to florida,
I'm guessing it was you, ray.
Where'd you get these?
does it matter?
they're just pictures, patty.
they don't mean... anything.
read the document.
you transferred stock to gregory malina, then told him to sell using information you got from your client.
I don't give a shit about your private life, ray.
but I can't sit on this kind of information. - Patty...
unless you and I come to some arrangement.
there is no way frobisher is going to offer you a better settlement.
I don't want one.
this case is going to be tried in a courtroom.
I am not tanking my own case at trial.
think about it, ray.
take your time.
I don't have to think about it.
Frobisher's my client.
and my friend.
we wouldn't be having this conversation if gregory malina were still alive.
you're a baptist, right, ray?
repent.
thank you.
Mr. Phillips wants to sit down with you later.
I'll be here.
I think we just got our second wedding gift.
Really? Yeah.
it's probably from aunt barbara.
she told me she ordered something online last week.
okay, hang on, mom.
hang on. I'll open it.
you know, - Hang on.
ordering gifts on the internet is not as easy as people say.
I tried to find your name on the registry page, but there were six ellen parsons in new york alone.
anyway, you know this means you're going to have to start sending thank you notes.
Oh, my god.
what?
who would send this?
what is it?
honey, what is it?
I miss you David Love Lila
Hey, ellen?
what's going on?
Yeah, do you still have lila dimeo's phone number?
Yeah, I think.
Hey, there, it's lila.
sorry, I'm not around, but i bet ya know what to do and when to do it.
this is ellen parsons.
stay away from my fianc?
or i swear to god I will come after you, you crazy bitch.
2 DAYS LATER
we're done, ellen.
Hello?
Li... stop, stop it.
just stop. Listen to me.
damn it, will you just-- no!
Lila, you need to stop calling me!
that was, uh...
that was great, ray.
thanks for dinner.
had to celebrate your new job. - Yeah.
july 2002
it's gonna feel strange going to work in a suit.
looks good on you.
Thanks.
what is it?
we can't be in contact anymore.
why not?
looks like the government is charging my client.
I... I don't know anything.
you know enough.
we can't be seen together.
okay.
I'm gonna miss you, gregory.
I'll miss you too, ray.
what?
what is it?
no, ray... - Gregory, please.
please...
no, ray, come on. That'S...
that's not who I am.
I don't believe you.
please.
Jesus, ray!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, ray.
I'm sorry. I...
what is it, ray?
george moore is dead.
I heard.
I got a letter...
from gregory malina. - When?
it's over, art.
what is?
it's over.
ray, what's over?
ray, what the hell are you talking ab...
Hey.
what time is it?
did you eat?
there's some grilled salmon in the fridge.
first thing in the morning...
we have to leave.
to go where, my sister's? - No...
we have to get out of the country.
I don't understand.
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
right now I need you to pack our things.
ray, you have to tell me what...
you have to trust me.
will you do that?
yes...
Yes, of course.
okay.
I have a few things I have to take care of.
you got my message?
I did.
Yeah, so...
I've been mulling things over.
I'd like to sit down with you, see how we can work this out.
I'm glad to hear it, ray.
we can get together first thing in the morning.
I'd prefer sooner.
I don't want this hanging over me, you understand?
of course.
what are you doing later tonight?
I can be anywhere you want me to be.
Yeah, it was the first movie I saw in, like, four months where I actually stayed awake.
OK -Yeah
okay, babe. I love you
love
hey there, ray.
Hello, patty.
you want a drink?
Thanks, no.
well, sit.
how you holding up?
I've been better.
did I ever tell you why I became a lawyer, ray?
no, you never told me.
I thought I could change the world.
silly, huh?
I just liked getting to wear a tie every day.
you and I are two sides of the same coin.
how's that?
we love the game.
another case, a bigger win.
it's an addiction like any other.
you're blackmailing me, patty.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
long as we're clear.
Frobisher is guilty, ray.
help me set things right.
you're a friend.
we bring out the best in each other.
after this, we have a hundred more rounds to go.
I don't see how that's possible.
I am not looking to destroy you.
we attorneys survive.
it's the clients that come and go.
I can't go into a courtroom...
and deliberately lose my case.
I know it will be painful, ray.
but six months, a year from now, it'll all blow over, and you'll come work with me.
I'm serious.
you would do that?
hire the finest goddamn litigator I've ever come up against?
Yes, ray.
Absolutely.
there's a place for you here.
it's win-win, for both of us.
okay, patty.
good, ray.
I'm glad.
you know...
I always wanted to work with you, patty.
not anymore.
something happen?
okay. Start eating.
here, baby. Aura?
what's wrong, Ma?
nothing.
come on, start eating your food, it's gonna get cold.
so, how's your fathers new girlfriend?
what is She, 14? 15?
you tell them. They have a right to know.
what? What?
it's just a setback.
Betty.
what am I gonna do, Abra?
give up? Is that what you're saying?
it's gone. They looked?
can't they look again? They did.
mistakes happen.
obviously, or Kenny wouldn't be in prison.
Betty, they destroyed it.
no.
that evidence exists somewhere and I'm gonna find it.
okay. Let's say you do find it.
what if the DNA matches Kenny's?
get out. Get the hell out of my house right now!
no, you gotta hear this.
even if you're the most amazing fighter, the most brilliant lawyer in the world, there are forces greater than you and you may not win!
you think I haven't thought of that?
no. You haven't.
just go.
sorry, boys.
it's just a setback.
eat your food. Come on.
good morning.
can I help you? Yeah.
I'm an attorney, Abra Rice, and I'm trying to locate evidence from the Kenneth Waters trial.
Yeah, we spoke on the phone.
did you check with the courthouse?
Yeah, and they can't locate it.
Yeah, well, like I said, they probably destroyed it by now.
I mean, it's been, like, what...
Betty Anne Waters?
you know, I'm sorry, I don't...
lieutenant Daniels.
I knew your brother Kenny.
I was a rookie here when...
you're his sister?
but I am an attorney, and he is my client.
holy shit!
my sister won't even send me a birthday card!
I was just telling Ms. Waters that we don't have any evidence here.
here? From back then?
that's a lot of years.
would you mind looking?
you're really his lawyer, huh?
Yeah.
that's it for the old evidence.
and there's nowhere else?
that's it, just supplies.
working hard for your brother. I wish I had better news for you.
how's Kenny holding up?
not so great.
I remember that case.
funny guy, that Kenny. I gotta tell ya, even with what he did... He didn't do it.
I liked Kenny. We all liked him.
Nancy Taylor didn't.
Yeah, well, Nancy Taylor doesn't work here anymore.
why not?
she got herself into a little hot water.
Groton Police Department. Chief O'Connell's office.
no. He's not available right now, sir.
I gave him your message.
I understand.
I will let him know.
why aren't you a cop anymore?
I left the force when I got married.
Really? You mean it had nothing to do with you framing another cop?
I beg your pardon?
what was his name? Oh, yeah, Stanley Randall.
he found out that you were dirty, so you got a waitress from the Rusty Scupper to accuse him of rape.
is that what they told you over in Ayer?
I'm sure you can imagine what it was like to be the only woman on that police force. Hmm?
I wasn't dirty, and the rape charge wasn't false.
the truth is, they never got over me solving the Brow murder.
you didn't solve it. You put an innocent man in prison.
I am sorry you have wasted your life on this.
your brother killed that woman.
Hi, Don.
Hi, Betty.
is she sleeping?
she usually is at 5: 00 in the morning.
come on in. I'll get her up.
Thanks.
baby, sweetheart. Guess who?
I wish we could use this. I mean, she framed a cop, for Chrissakes.
it still doesn't prove she framed Kenny,
I mean, it wouldn't be enough.
thank you.
no. it's not enough for a new trial.
God, I hate the damn legal system. it's so fucking inconvenient.
I'm sorry I kicked you out of my house.
it's okay. Your mac and cheese sucks.
you were wearing that outfit when you said you were me?
Yeah. Too bad being you didn't get me anywhere.
you know, there is one thing we haven't tried yet.
how long will it take you to make yourself look like a lawyer?
Hi. I'm attorney Abra Rice and this is my associate.
I'd like to talk to Mrs. Halloran.
do you have an appointment?
it's a pressing legal matter. Mrs. Halloran's aware of it.
I'm Mrs. Halloran.
hello. I'm Abra Rice, we spoke earlier.
Yes, but as I told you on the phone...
I'm Betty Anne Waters.
and the evidence in question is from my brother's trial.
I'm also his attorney, and I became an attorney just to help him.
I understand that you looked, but if you could please just look one more time.
if we did this for every person who came in here...
we don't have the Staff.
look, I don't know what else to do but beg.
I'm asking for a favor, a favor from a complete stranger, but, please.
you're talking about evidence that's 16 years old.
our record shows it was destroyed.
is it possible that the record could be wrong?
that's highly unlikely.
but possible.
are those your grand kids?
Yes. Beautiful.
they look like you.
please.
my brother's innocent. And you're right, it's been 16 years.
and our family really wants him home.
she's there.
why don't we come back here?
just set it right there.
thank you. It's okay,
here you go.
you're allowed to touch.
14B.
victim's blood.
number 29?
victim.
exhibit es, A through F.
perpetrator.
good job, counselor.
I'll need to file a motion to preserve the evidence.
well, that office is closed now, but I'll file it for you in the morning.
I'll get you the paperwork.
you're gonna...You're just gonna leave the box out on the table?
it'll be fine.
my brother's life is in there. Please.
could I just put a sign on it with my name?
that really isn't necessary. Please.
if anything happens to this...
well, all right.
okay. Thank you. Yeah.
could I borrow some tape?
it's right over there.
okay. Here you go.
thank you.
all right.
okay.
you missed a spot.
he's getting out of here!
shit.
hello.
is this Betty Anne Waters? Yes.
this is Barry Scheck.
Oh, my God. Hi.
Hi.
how are you?
fine, fine! Great!
congratulations on finding the evidence.
it's extraordinary.
thank you, but I really didn't do anything.
you mean, besides becoming a lawyer?
no, I mean, you know, we were just lucky that the box was still there.
I hear you beat up an old lady to find it.
no, but that was gonna be my next step.
Kenny thinks he's getting out tomorrow.
I wish.
das don't like to admit they put an innocent person in prison.
and this DA, Martha Coakley, has just gotten elected, so she's really not gonna like it.
how long do you think it's gonna take?
we're gonna have some hoops to go through, it might be a couple of months.
a couple of months?
it may be less.
but the important thing is, if your brother's innocent...
he is.
then this is a travesty of justice, and we will get him out.
thank you, Barry. Thank you. Thank you so much for calling.
no hugging.
I'm his sister!
he's in segregation. And that's the rules.
let's go.
Thanks, Dad.
what were you thinking? Why wouldn't you just take the test?
it's been a year, Betty Anne. A fucking year.
I don't trust them. I'm not doing it.
what?
I'm not doing it.
Jesus Christ, Kenny, are you out of your mind?
this is it. This is what we've been waiting for!
what, you're not gonna take the fucking test?
why now, all of a sudden, out of the blue?
why can't you be in the room when they test me?
they won't allow that. They're not gonna agree to that!
so, I'm supposed to trust a bunch of staties to do it?
this isn't a choice. You have to do this.
it's gonna test positive.
they'll find a way. They're gonna fuck me again.
you'll see.
I'm leaving.
you'll do it, or I'll kill you.
that's your sister and your lawyer talking.
what the hell is going on over there?
why don't we have the test results yet?
the evidence is still sitting in the crime lab.
just sitting there?
it takes six months to approve the testing, five to decide how to test it, and now they're doing nothing?
that's what you're telling me?
Martha Coakley is definitely stonewalling this.
are we having a famine?
I have teenagers, remember?
look, do we even know if Kenny's DNA ever made it to the lab?
or if the crime samples are still there?
it's there.
have you seen them?
why aren't you doing anything about this?
we call the DA's office every day, and the crime lab, the interns have sent, like, 8, 000 e-mails.
interns? Jesus, Barry, this is beyond interns!
it's just gonna take some more time.
great. You and your interns take your time while Kenny rots in jail.
fuck. Okay.
you shouldn't take it out on Barry.
you're right.
are you Dr. McGilvray?
Yes, l am.
Betty Anne Waters.
I need the evidence for my brothers trial sent today.
excuse me? I'm sorry, I'm don't know who...
the DNA evidence from Kenneth Water's trial.
why is it just sitting here?
we have procedures to follow...
I'll tell you the procedures. Test the goddamn evidence today and fedex the result to Ed Blake's lab in California,
how hard is that? Why don't you leave your name and number with Lois here, and someone will...
so, what is it? Martha Coakley's telling you not to do it?
excuse me, I have a meeting that I'm late for.
or is there some promotion you'll get if you kiss her butt?
you can't keep fucking with my brothers life like this!
you have my name and number. I called, many times.
mom, let's go! We're gonna miss the kickoff!
I'll be right down!
shit. I forgot my phone!
when's the last time you used it? I don't remember.
call it. Maybe it'll ring.
Yeah. You check my desk. Okay.
Where's it coming from?
the couch.
holy shit. What?
he's innocent! What?
uncle Kenny's innocent! It wasn't his DNA.
kenneth Waters is eliminated as the source of the male blood.
Oh, my God.
you guys... Oh, my God.
we did it. You...We did it. We did it.
we did it. We did it. We...
I love you guys. I love you.
it was all you.
is this what I think it is?
Yup.
is this for real?
Yeah. We did it.
you did it. You fucking did it.
when am I getting out?
a few days. A few days?
I can't wait a few days!
why not? They know I'm innocent!
Hey. Do you hear that, motherfuckers? Waters.
I'm innocent.
negative DNA test. Waters. Waters.
I'm very happy for you, but take your seat.
okay. My baby sister's a fucking genius.
you look great. They can still kick your ass.
she's getting me out of here.
sit down and finish your visit.
so when? What do you think? Monday? Tuesday?
no. I have to hear back from Barry.
as soon as he reaches Martha Coakley and she vacates the conviction.
well, you tell Miss Martha fucking Coakley
I want a shiny new limousine picking me up, with a fully stocked bar!
you gotta call Mandy for me.
you gotta call her and tell her they know I'm innocent.
I will. As soon as I get out of here, I will.
tell her I'm getting out.
tell her I miss her and I wanna see her.
will you tell her that?
I will.
I love you, Kenny.
I love you.
I love you.
Mandy, this is your Aunt Betty Anne.
you probably don't remember me, but I really need to talk to you about your dad.
it's very important. It's nothing bad.
I mean, it's great. We finally found the evidence that proves he's innocent.
so he wanted me to call you and let you know.
so he thought...
you have zero messages.
Hey, you guys hungry?
I'm gonna throw you a sandwich up. I've got ham and tuna.
mom, if you throw a sandwich up here, the roof will cave in.
very funny. I'll remember that when you wanna bring a girl up here.
at least Uncle Kenny'll think it's nice compared to jail.
Barry? Hi.
thank God! I'm going crazy here, and Kenny's going absolutely insane.
I know. I'm sorry.
did you reach Martha Coakley?
Yes.
What'd she say? How long is it gonna take?
there's a problem.
she said...
that there was still enough evidence to try you as an accomplice.
so I'm not getting out?
not now. But.
I'm sorry, Kenny.
it's okay.
I can't do this anymore.
Kenny.
can't
it's not fair, you know. It's not fair.
I gotta go. Kenny.
I'm gonna kill that fucking bitch! Kenny.
I'm gonna kill her.
waters. Sit down.
Kenny.
Kenny, Kenny, listen to me.
we can't give up.
we...we have Barry on our side now. No, no, no.
and we will fight her in court.
Hey, you tell Barry forget it, okay.
we're way past that, little sis.
take care of your boys. You gotta move on. It's over.
it's not over. It's over, honey.
it's not over. Why? It's over, honey.
fuck her. I fucking knew it. Motherfucker.
Kenny, sit...
waters! Motherfucker.
sit down, or you're out of here!
Hey, man. Haven't you heard? I'm never getting out of here. Never.
I'm here forever, man.
remain down.
Hey, get out of my face, shithead. Come on, sit down.
I tell you that it's over. You understand?
I said, sit down!
I'm talking to my sister. Move...
visit's over.
take your hands off.
Kenny, Kenny...Kenny, don't.
that's not nice...Motherfucker. Kenny!
motherfucker. I told you to stay out of it.
Kenny!
take him down. Don't.
motherfucker! Motherfucker!!
motherfucking bitch! I told you. Don't.
didn't I fucking tell you?
they made fools out of both of us.
they made fools out of both of us.
Betty Anne. Settle down now.
we're fucking chumps.
we're fucking chumps. I told you.
Kenny's in solitary, for Chrissakes!
why is everyone congratulating me?
you proved he's innocent.
Yeah, well, not to Martha Coakley, I didn't.
we'll fight her.
we are not going back to court.
Kenny will not survive another trial!
and I'll be damned if we have to prove his innocence all over again just because of that evil bitch.
there won't be a trial if we gather new evidence.
how are we gonna do that?
think about it.
the DNA doesn't just prove that Kenny's innocent...
it proves all those witnesses were lying.
Rosseanna?
Oh, shit.
well, see, what happened was I was threatened, okay?
who threatened you?
don't I know you from TV?
Oh, yeah! I know! You're that famous Jew lawyer.
Roseanna, who threatened you?
you know, that fucking cop, Nancy Taylor, had it out for Kenny.
she kidnaps me, right? Her and this Chief of Police.
and they take me to this room, this hotel, against my will.
that ain't legal.
and they get me drunk. You know, am I gonna argue?
and the Chief of Police, he's wanting me to pray with him.
you know? So I get down, I pray, for forgiveness, forgiveness...Forgiveness for what?
cause they fucking lied, saying they had all this evidence they didn't have, telling me that I'm gonna be an accessory, and threatening to take my daughters away.
I was absolutely, totally sick.
I mean, I puked. I mean, you should have seen it.
I never seen pictures like that before in my life.
Oh, my God. This is the part.
pictures of Mrs. Brow?
...just happened.
he's your husband's best friend.
Yeah, the pictures.
you know, the fucking pictures.
you know, you've seen them.
she had stab wounds all over her body, and her brains are coming out and everything.
and I just went...
you know, I went hysterical. I was hysterical.
and I broke down and, you know, they were talking at me, like, "You want this to happen to you? "
you know, you want a fucking murderer walking out on the street?
it could happen to anybody.
your mother, your kids, you. You, meaning me.
so Nancy Taylor said that
Kenny could murder you or your mother or your girls?
Yeah, she fucking did. That's exactly right.
excuse my French.
I mean, there was a lot of thing that wasn't quite right in Denmark.
and I was trying to put it together, I just...
I mean, I was telling them.
I was, like, I was fucking plastered at the time.
I don't remember what Kenny said.
and you'll sign this affidavit once we're done?
I can't live like this any longer.
Betty Anne, I'm sorry.
I know I put your brother in there. I know I did, I did.
I'm sorry.
but I was up against a wall, you know, I was railroad.
I told them Kenny is innocent.
you know?
Nancy Taylor, she fucking...
she says, "Once I get my lead, I never let it go. "
so, I just need to know, you'll sign this affidavit, then?
Yeah.
so, after we leave here, we'll just...
you can come with us, we'll just quickly get it notarized.
what about perjury, then?
what about perjury?
Yeah. If I sign this, then everybody's gonna know I lied before.
what's the statute of limitations?
I didn't know she could say so many syllables.
I'd like to knock out the rest of her teeth.
taste in women was not one of your brother's strong points.
Mandy? Yeah.
I'm your Aunt Betty Anne.
your father's sister.
what do you want?
did you get my messages?
I...I gotta go.
I really need to talk to your mother.
she's not home.
please, your father's innocent.
my father's a murderer.
no. The DNA test proved he's not.
wait. Did she give you his letters?
he wrote to you every week!
no.
he's innocent!
ma, are the pancakes almost ready?
Hey, guys.
anybody up for a drive?
any pancakes left back there?
Oh. You wanted some?
Richard! Give me One.
forget it, you lose! Hey!
immature. Immature.
Hey, come on. Come on.
you're gonna make me crash. Here.
one pancake.
okay.
you guys gonna tell your father this is how I made you spend Christmas?
your secret's safe with us,
besides, we're willing accomplices.
you guys would do this for each other, right?
if Ben tried to go to law school for me,
I'd die an old man in prison.
don't worry about it, I Wouldn't do it.
you wouldn't?
I mean, I'd want to help and all, but I don't think I could give up what I really wanted to do.
which is what? Sleep till noon and hang out at the mall?
shut up. What, you'd do it for me?
Yeah. I would.
you'd sacrifice your whole life for me?
when you put it like that...
forget .
you think I sacrificed my whole life?
it's okay. Come on. Hey, give me the gift.
come on, let's go.
merry Christmas. Mandy, these are your cousins.
Thanks, but this isn't a good time right now.
I'm sorry. Merry Christmas.
okay, here. Sorry, I can't take that.
come on.
the boys got you a video.
God knows long it'll take to approve it.
do you remember the year they wouldn't let me give you Babe?
Hey, here we go.
happy New Year.
we're getting close, everyone!
nine, eight, seven, six, five, four...
...three, two, one...
I'm working.
please.
l have this memory where I'm sitting on the kitchen floor and I'm like three or four years old, and my mom and aunt are talking about
daddy's shirt being covered with blood.
I couldn't figure it out. You know, I just didn't understand why Daddy's shirt was covered in blood.
it wasn't.
she lied?
the DNA proves she did.
why would she lie like that?
I don't know, honey, but that's what we need to ask her.
did he really write me every week?
for 18 years.
even when you were just a baby.
is he getting out of jail?
they're not gonna let him out without new evidence.
why not?
because people don't like to admit when they've made a mistake.
we need a statement from your mother.
I can't control what she does.
Yeah, I know. Either could Kenny.
you know, if Massachusetts had the death penalty, your father would be dead by now.
he made that for you.
he's had that on the wall of his cell this whole time.
after me and Kenny split up, I had this boyfriend,
Robert.
and he says that we could get money from the cops if we rat on Kenny.
so he goes to Nancy Taylor and says that
I told him that Kenny confessed to Mrs. Brow's murder.
Nancy Taylor tells Robert he can fuck himself.
and she hauls me in, brings me to this hotel, makes me look at all these gross pictures.
and she says that they can prove I was an accessory,
and that they'll take Mandy away.
Hi. Do you guys have a printer I can use?
can you guarantee I won't go to jail if I sign this?
no. l can't.
sign it, Ma.
Martha Coakley, please.
no. I have Barry Scheck calling and it's urgent.
ms. Coakley?
Betty Anne Waters.
look, Barry's tied up right now, but he wanted me to let you know that Brenda Marsh, your key witness in the Kenneth Waters case, has just recanted her original testimony.
and we just faxed the affidavit, and so you should be getting it shortly.
hang on, here's Barry now.
Martha! Yeah. That's something about Brenda Marsh, isn't it?
Oh, really?
listen, I just wanted to give you a heads up while you're deciding whether or not to vacate Kenny's conviction, the folks over at the Boston Globe and the New York Times, they just love this story.
no. They're all over it.
Yeah, the phone's been ringing. Yeah.
great. All right. Okay, bye-bye.
are all sides in agreement to vacate the conviction?
Yes, Your Honor.Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor.
kenneth Waters, you're free to go.
that's it? That's it.
Hey, those 18 years, man, they're gone.
right now, I'm...
how could you possibly thank your sister for what she's done for you?
I don't know. How would you thank her? It's a good question.
Betty, you have any big cases lined up after this?
no, no, no. I never really planned on practicing law, so...
is this for us? This is for you.
we chipped in.
Hey. Kenny, Kenny, Kenny.
Hey.
what? Look who's here.
where?
it's Mandy.
that's Mandy? Yeah.
go talk to her.
just two seconds, guys.
Hi.
Hi.
you're so beautiful.
my whole life, I thought...
not your whole life.
what my mother did to you...
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
that's not your fault.
that's not your fault, honey.
Oh, come on, let's get out of here. Come on.
come on.
lake Betty Anne and Kenny.
lake Kenny and Betty Anne.
even if it had taken you another 20 years or so,
I would've been okay.
another 20 years?
Jesus. I would've lost my mind!
no, I mean, you know...
knowing you were out here, knowing that you loved me that much.
in July 2009, eight years after Kenny was proven innocent,
Betty Anne won a major settlement against the Ayer Police Department and former police officer Nancy Taylor.
due to the Massachusetts statute of limitations,
Nancy Taylor was immune from criminal prosecution.
Betty Anne continues to co-manage Aidan's Pub and works for the Innocence Project on cases and legislative reform to prevent wrongful conviction.
there have been 254 post-conviction DNA exonerations since 1989.
the murderer of Katharian Brow has never been found.
what goes on inside your head？ Walking slowly towards the night. There's nothing wrong with me you say. You kept me spellbound by the hour. And I try, I tried with all my might. And I try, I tried with all my might. Did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
saw you again the other day. Walking fast into the night. There's nothing wrong with me, you say. I think I just saw the lie. And I try, I tried with all my might. And I try, I tried with all my might. Did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
well, I've been bad before. And I know the feeling well. They're always there. I can sense you. There's always a heaven where there's a hell. Oh, did I fer you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?
did I let you down?
did you want too much?
did he steal your heart when you felt his touch?

since 1970, the federalwitness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses some criminals, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is somebody wants them dead.
Boston we've tried, father.
but no matter what we do, we just...
sixteen Months ago don't feel about each other the way we used to.
we kind of...
can't stand each other.
I see this a lot these days.
I think you'll find that looking beyond yourselves.
really can't stand each other.
he's got it, Don.
spending time helping others is the best way I know to open your hearts.
you're familiar with the immaculate heart soup kitchen on third.
Yes, I've heard great things. - We run it.
what about prayer?
we attend mass every day.
we have for years. - Can I finish a sentence?
I don't know. Can you?
maybe there's a more carnal solution.
you could go ayway to recreate your first night of passion.
I was thinking more along the lines of annulment.
well, unless you're first cousins or one of you was previously married, I don't know what grounds-- the Kennedys do it all the time.
for the millionth times, you're not Kennedy.
it just doesn't seem fair.
feel free to take it up with his eminence in rome.
so that's your advice?
sex or prayer?
listen... Don, Ruth...
you're obviously good people and devout catholics.
you need to trust that god has brought you together for a reason, and holds a divine purpose for you as a married couple.
in other words, we're screwed.
like monks before the tudors.
we could, you know-- - don't say it.
divorce.
how can you even suggest such a thing?
especially in god＇s house.
Yeah, I don't know about you, but I'd rather be misrable with you in this life than face eternal damnationin the next.
I suppose you're right.
I mean, this is how we show our devotion to god.
by accepting that we'll always be unhappy together and nothing will ever change.
interfering with my business, father.
you want to save souls?
you go convert some protestants.
but you leave my whores the hell alone! - No, I can't do that!
please, Joseph, think about your immortal soul.
No!
he's with-- - jesus christ!
it's Joseph Connor. - Who's that?
only the biggest racketeer in boston.
come on, let's get out of here.
Albuquerque - Present Day
just a little bit of love.
Amen, Harold. Good job.
Phil, you know the rules. No pill, no breakfast.
take the pill, phil, phil, pill.
good boy. Okay, okay. Now go get breakfast.
Hey, Mary. What'd you bring?
Oh, just, you know, more unclaimed lost and found stuff from the federal building.
Oh, you went out and bought these yourself.
well...
that is so unlike you.
Hey, Mary, good to see you.
Yeah, me too. How are things, Don?
couldn't be better.
uh, Ruth, did you remember to schedule the hospice delivery?
you mean the same delivery I've scheduled every week for over a year?
Yes, that one. - Miss Ruthie, William stole my egg!
sorry, I have to referee.
so you guys still can't stand each other?
Hey, she even finishes your sentences.
that's fun, right?
please explain in god's name why you two don't get divorced.
you make each other miserable.
and please, don't say it's because you're catholic.
lots of catholics get divorced these days. Hell, I'm catholic.
I plan on getting divorced one day.
be a lucky man who divorces you. - Damn straight.
listen, Mary. It doesn't matter how many people get divorced.
it's not a democracy. We don't vote on god's will.
our vows made us one in his eyes.
and who are we to question that?
although I must admit,
I don't understand why he won't let Ruth be with someone that makes her happy.
okay then, too weird for me.
call me if you need anything. - Will do.
thanks for the drop-off.
okay, so don's a little anal, and maybe Ruth's a bit of a ball buster. Who isn't?
still, you gotta wonder, if such good people with so much in common can't find happiness together, what hope is there for the rest of us?
why do they have to come here to eat?
ever since I told Mary about the family discount, I cannot get rid of her.
two weeks ago she didn't want anything to do with Chico.
and then we start hanging out, and all of a sudden she wants to make it work.
leave it alone. - You know what I think?
I think she secretly wants us to get together, that way she's off the hook and it's not her fault.
that's why she keeps asking me to do stuff with him.
I strongly advise you to not put that theory to the test.
so this is nice, right?
it's like our first date all over again.
I hope not.
it took weeks for those bruises to heal.
technically, that was our third date.
only if you count being introduced and running into each other at the grocery stories dates.
Yeah. I have to.
so are limes limes first and then they turn into lemons? Or is it the other way around?
Oh, sweetie.
do you really thinklimes and lemons are the same fruit?
isn't a lemon just a really ripe lime?
honey.
what about cauliflower and broccoli?
what? So I'm not good at produce!
it's not like ever had any growing up.
why don't we forget about the whole thing? I was
no, no, no, please, I want to clear the air.
here you make this sweet, heartfelt gesture and I completely.
well, okay, in fairness to me, your proposal was spectacularly ill-conceived.
I mean, ridiculous, but still.
Hey, what's up?
there's been an accident.
don ferguson's been killed.
I was just talking to him down at the shelter.
seemed like henever left that place.
he was one of the few truly good, selfless people I've ever met.
you know, Any Rand'scentral thesis posited selflessness as antithetical to good.
100 bucks says you die a lonely old man.
Oh, what's he doing here?
what are you doing here?
jogging. - In your car.
I don't like to overdo. What about you?
well, with a fire and a burned body, there's always a question of arson or homicide.
car was registered to a Donald Ferguson.
I take it you knew him.
Yeah, he and his wife run a homeless shelter.
I help out from time to time. What?
nothing, I guess I just don't see you as...
life in service to others kind of person.
but hey, good for you.
so you know of any reason why I should suspect foul play?
your friend, he piss anybody off lately?
I can't imagine. The guy really was a saint.
hmm, if memory serves, a whole bunch of saints were murdered because they go ton the wrong side of the wrong people.
mind if I break the news to his widow? We go back.
knock yourself out.
she's not gonna disappear, is she?
all right, get back to me. Thanks.
it looks like an accident, but we should move Ruth just in case.
sounds good.
the FBI confirmed that Joseph Connor is still in prison awaiting trial.
but his two sons have apparently kept up the family's good name.
I'm waiting for an update on their where abouts from the bureau office in boston.
all right, thanks for checking.
Oh, if you can, start running backgrounds on the people at the shelter.
on their meds they're colorful. Off 'em, who knows?
all over it.
I have to see him.
Ruth, Ruth, it's not a great idea.
he was burned pretty badly.
that doesn't matter. I have to say a prayer over him at least.
he deserves at least that.
all right. All right, I'll--I'll try to make arrangements tomorrow.
he was a good man. I wish.
what?
that we'd never met.
he could've been happy with someone else.
I made him so miserable.
no, that's not true.
you two accomplished so much together.
I know he was happy with that.
look, I know it's the last thing you want to deal with right now, but we have to get you to a safe house.
no, I can't.
the people here will be distraught when they hear the news.
I need to be here for them.
besides, I thought it was just an accident.
Yeah, it probably--it probably was.
but until we rule out other possibilities.
you think Joseph Connorhad something to do with this?
no, I don't.
but we don't take those kind of chances.
sorry, it's not subject to discussion. It's WITSEC policy.
Ruth, we have to leave now.
no, I won't abandon these people. - Ruth
I'll leave the program before I leave the shelter.
and that's not subject to discussion.
besides, these people here, they would never let any one hurt me.
unless it was one of them who killed don.
I just don't understand how you can chase a ball around in circles with a bat and glove all day every day and call that a career. What's the point?
well, first of all, we don't chase in circles.
we run around a diamond. Okay.
but the point is, I guess, that it's...
graceful, and athletic, and pure.
and it doesn't pretend or need to be anything other than what it is.
it's just baseball.
and I'm really good at it.
what?
Oh, nothing. It must be really nice to be good at something.
you're good at things.
no, I'm really not. - No.
I wonder what happened.
can I help you?
Yeah, I was just wondering if I could hang up a flyer.
we don't normally allow people to.
it's for a play that we're doing downtown. A musical.
I love this show!
when I was a young girl, I always dreamt of playing charity.
Oh, well, then you should audition.
audition for what?
uh, yeah. Yeah, right.
what?
I'm too old?
not pretty enough?
no, no, I just think you're too classy to play a prostitute.
Oh, please. You are so trying to get yourself out of trouble.
I am not.
Hey, you are absolutely hot enough to play a hooker.
hell, I'd pay good money to have sex with you.
mom was like this prodigy dancer at age 15 until a bunch of stuff happened.
and my dad was a super gambler.
and Mary, she's always been great at everything.
wait, your dad was the gambler?
no, that's kenny rogers.
my dad was a gambler.
a gambler. - Yeah.
and he pretty much did it professionally.
he won this car in a poker game.
this car?
your dad won this car?
well, yeah, he supposedly won $17, 000, but he was afraid to face jinx because he'd been gone for three days.
so he stopped at the dealership on his way back, and he came home with this little beauty.
actually, I'll show you. My mom kept the original registration.
let's see.
this car is about the only thing in her life she's ever taken care of.
here we go. You see?
so what do you know about lemons?
Limones?
it's--it's my mother.
what the hell is taking so long?
you better not be doing what I think you're doing.
who do you think I am? You?
just get your as back here. Now!
uh, I gotta go. My mom's flipping out about the car.
I'll be back tomorrow to take you to physical therapy.
well, actually, Mary offered to take me.
ha, right! Good luck. All right, call me when she doesn't show.
anyway, I was thinking afterwards we could maybe grab lunch or a movie?
your treat, of course.
well, I already... told Mary I'd go out with her.
and maybe lunch and a movie isn't such a good idea for us.
I don't want to cross the line.
all right, well, I guess I'll see you around then.
Yeah, well... I guess...
good night, then.
Mrs. Ferguson, I'm so very sorry for your loss.
may I see Donald now?
you should know the burns are extensive.
I just wanted to say good-bye.
and, uh... I miss you.
didn't see that one coming, did you?
neither did I.
I'm sorry we couldn't be happy together.
I don't yet know the purpose of our time together.
but I'm sure from where you are the answers are clear.
I hope you know that even though I couldn't understand you, I did...
I do love you.
thank you.
when can I lay him to rest?
I should be able to release the body this afternoon.
I don't know if this'll be of any comfort, but he wouldn't have lived much longer anyway.
I don't understand. - Why?
his liver. It's completely cirrhotic.
he would've been dead within a couple of months.
why was don's liver cirrhotic?
you are aware, mrs. Ferguson, that your husband was an alcoholic.
no, that's not right.
I'm afraid there's no question.
his blood alcohol was 0. 28 at the time of his death.
no, Don never drank. Except for the sacrament.
he helped so many people get sober.
he couldn't stand alcohol. - Alcoholics can be very secretive.
sometimes the people they're closest to don't even know.
my husband got up at 5: 00 every morning to minister to the needy.
he didn't get home until usually well past midnight.
so if you're telling me that that person on that table was an alcoholic, then I'm telling you...
that's not my husband.
then you need to get me a DNA sample, because the body on this table has been a fall-down drunk every day of his adult life.
we got a big problem.
so I don't get it.
someone killed Don and then left a different body in the car to throw us off?
I don't know. Maybe.
could be a kid napping. Any word from the FBI?
Yeah, connor's two sons left boston three days ago on a fishing trip to Mexico.
why didn't the FBI give us a heads up?
well, they're very busy, important people.
Oh, that's unbelievable.
anyway, they still can't locate the connor brothers.
they flew into Sandiego, where they were supposed to meet up with a friend.
but no one in the family can or will confirm or deny anything after that.
seems the brothers are big on witness intimidation, but not so much on itineraries.
but if they killed or took Don to keep him from testifying, why cover it up?
it's more likely to get the trial delayed than thrown out.
who can know the inner workings of the criminal mind?
isn't that kind of our job?
okay, how about this?
maybe the body's one of the brothers.
or another accomplice who got killed accidentally.
or out lived his usefulness.
a lot of maybe in what you just said. - You're right.
why don't we let the FBI worry about tracking the brothers?
we'll concentrate on protecting Ruth and finding Don.
preferably alive.
sounds like a good plan.
I'll head back to the office. - Okay.
Oh, you made it.
of course I made it. Why wouldn't I?
uh, no reason.
Oh, sexy. So something came up at work.
I'm gonna have to just drop you off. You can get a ride home, right?
sure.
in case you didn't notice, I've been trying to be more honest.
well, I don't know. Maybe "open" is a better word.
open with people and myself about how I relate.
which is to say most of the time I don't.
uh, I'll call her back.
Oh, don't not talk to her on my account.
step outside if you need some privacy. - Of course not.
I really want to hear what you're saying.
as I'm discovering, it has a lot do with how I handle or, um, don't handle commitment.
you know your sister. She can talk all day long.
is there something you want to tell me?
I think it's great that you're finally opening up.
I mean about you and Brandi.
get it. For god's sake, talk to her!
Yeah, I'll be quick.
hello.
it's not fair. I schlep you back and forth from therapy.
I do your grocery shopping.
and I wash your gross laundry.
and as soon as I want to do something fun, it's crossing a goddamn line?
listen, Brandi, it's just that last night.
why don't the three of us go and see a movie together sometime?
Oh, please, if we wait for Mary to be available, we'll never go.
and what about last night?
hang on, I'm getting another call.
this is ridiculous. What the hell is going on with you and Raphael?
nothing. - Really?
okay, well, he just took the phone into the next room to talk to you, so something's going on.
nothing, it's just a disagreement.
if you're sleeping with him, I hope you have the decency to tell me.
I'm not sleeping with him!
I can't believe everybody thinks that I would do that.
first mom, and now you. I would never sleep with him.
unless of course you two were definitely broken up.
you know what? I don't have time for this high school B. S.
tell Chico to call me when you two figure this out.
what did you do?
what? Nothing!
why is everything always my fault?
God, go to hell.
Hello? Hello?
now who's gonna drive me?
do you remember anyone walking out this way this morning?
no, not that ,I can recall.
well, someone walked away from the crime scene.
I can't figure out where he went next.
don't worry. I know just who to call.
tracks definitely belong to a male.
approximately six feet,180 pounds.
this guy's totally jerking our chain.
from the trail of blood, he's seriously injured.
you can see by his gaithe's getting weaker.
Yeah, go on, smart ass. Say something else.
Oh, hell no.
car pulled up here.
four-door sedan.
rear right tire's bald.
looks like a guy got out.
there was a struggle.
our guy was pulled into the car.
Where'd they go next?
I-40 road.
with a 15-hour head start, whoever grabbed your guy could be anywhere from California to arkansas.
don's last cell phone call was to the shelter last night at 9: 16.
three and a half minutes.
strange no one mentioned talking to him.
looks like back stage at a fashion show.
only these people look healthier.
Hey, what's going on?
Oh, we're going to the church to pray for the soul of that poor man who died in Don's car.
and for Don's safe return.
uh, I know you're lapsed, but we'd love it if you came.
I'll try to make it. I'm just a little tied up at the moment, what with trying to find your missing husband and all.
listen, Don called the shelter last night around the same time he disappeared, and he spoke to someone for three minutes.
do you have any idea who that might be?
no, but Phil's been missing since last night.
and he wasn't at breakfast this morning.
he never misses breakfast.
he really shouldn't go a day without taking his medication.
you don't think he had-- - what kind of medication is he on?
clozapine. It's an antipsychotic.
I'll get the police on it.
I have to clean up for church.
sorry, I have to take care of this.
Hey, where were you last night?
I was here like always.
did you get any calls? Say around 9: 00?
Nope.
I'm sending a few marshals along for extra security just in case.
have they found those connor boys? - Not yet.
you'll be back right after the service, right?
we're having a picnic after the service.
Ruth, you need to take this seriously.
okay, I know what you're doing is important.
but if I can't protect you...
I really don't want to kick you out of the whole person protection program.
excuse me. I have to get everyone on the bus.
of course you do.
it's tough, huh?
what is?
watching the light go out on those childhood dreams.
so...
what dream did your little light go out on?
Oh, I wanted to play for the Yankees.
stupid.
why is that stupid?
because every boy in the world thinks he's gonna grow up and play for the yankees.
just like every little girl thinks she's going to, uh,
I don't know, star on broad way or some such nonsense.
it's not nonsense.
but you know what the hardest part is?
the dagger to the heart?
no, but I'm sure you'll tell me.
it's when the dream has passed you by, and you've made all these excuses.
you know, why it didn't happen.
and then one day, you have that epiphany.
we just weren't good enough.
we didn't have the goods.
I mean, if we did, well...
we wouldn't be here, would we?
I was good enough.
you gonna write "wash me"on the wind shield?
Hey, Ruth! Do you know whose car this is?
Yeah, it's cook's.
maybe he forgot the ketchup. - Yeah, I'm sure that's it.
real name is Peter·Odell.
multiple drunk and disorderlies, assault, burglary.
Yeah, and that's all in my past.
don and Ruth saved me. I owe them everything. I-I could never hurt Don.
come on, pete.
the dust and the bald tire put your car at the crash sight.
and I know you had a thing for Ruth.
hell, Don knew you had a thing for Ruth.
to tell you the truth, I think she's got a little thing for you too.
come on, it doesn't take a genius to figure your life gets a whole lot better with Don gone.
I swear I didn't do anything wrong.
we've got blood, skin, burnt clothes.
that car is a veritable cornucopia of damning evidence.
things are not looking good for you, my friend.
I didn't hurt Don.
but someone else did?
come on, peter.
new mexico is a death penalty state.
that other body turns out to be Phil, you're on the hook for two murders.
help yourself out.
I can't. I promised not to tell. - Tell what?
that you killed two innocent people?
okay. Okay.
don's car was stolen when he was delivering food to one of the out reach facilities.
he saw the guy steal his car, drive away, then veer off the road.
he ran after him to help, but by the time he got there, the car was totally engulfed.
he got burned and he cut up his leg pretty bad trying to pull the guy out.
calls me at the shelter, tells me to bring the first aid kit, but not to tell anyone.
I drove out there. I picked him up.
he bandaged himself up as best he could, and then he had me, um, drop him off at the free clinic.
he was--he was bleeding a lot.
but I swear he was alive.
don said that he had to disappear.
that everyone had to think that he died in the crash.
he wouldn't tell me why, but he made me promise not to tell a soul.
especially Ruth. He said if She ever found out, that she would be in great jeopardy.
Oh, you expect us to believe that load of crap.
any chance he's connected to the connors?
with that rap sheet, it wouldn't be a total shock.
especially since the FBI still can't find them.
is there any reason why I shouldn't arrest this mope right now?
none that I can think of.
Peter odell, you're under arrest for the murder of Donald Ferguson. Get up.
you have the right to remain silent...
but what you say will be used against you in a court of law.
Hey, Ruth.
I can't understand this anymore! It's too much.
he's dead, he's not dead, he's dead.
I don't know, it's just-- - hey, hey, calm down, calm down.
what's--what's going on?
Phil came to the service. He's alive.
but he's half out of his mind off his meds.
he said don's dead.
he said he saw Don die.
I'm on my way.
Congratulations. Phil's alive, but Don's dead. And you're as good as dead.
Oh, my god. No.
i-it wasn't me. You have to believe me.
no, I really don't.
Yes, I'd like to audition for your show.
okay, I gave him his pill.
but it hasn't taken effect yet.
okay, thanks.
Hey, Phil.
listen, I'll let you get-- I'll let you get back to your praying in a minute, now I need your help.
now, I need you to tell me what happened to Don？
don came to the church.
and--and we prayed.
he was hurt really bad.
did he say who hurt him? So... Don is praying. Then what happened?
then Don died.
I know it's hard.
but I need to know where his body is？ So we can catch whoever hurt him, okay?
don's in heaven. - No, not his spirit. His body.
Where's his body?
don's in heaven.
Phil, okay, when we die...
the body gets buried, and the soul goes to heaven.
the soul inside of Phil. - Right, the soul.
but I want to concentrate-- - Phil has five souls.
they talk all the time. It's really loud.
now they're talking about you.
where is sister constance when you need her?
okay, Phil...
Where's heaven?
in the sky. Okay, good.
souls go to the sky. Bodies stay here.
so where is Don's frickin' body, Phil?
heaven. - Okay.
in the sky with god and Mary and the angels.
Jesus.
St. James and st. Thomas. St. Phillip.
and st. Peter. And st. John.
so Don died.
then he went to heaven. Up there?
is that what you mean?
did you help Don die?
I put Don in heaven. Am I in trouble?
why don't you go pray with miss Ruth, okay?
Phil prays every day.
cook's locked up.
that's well. I think Phil might've killed Don.
keep an eye on him for me.
what else have I got to do?
Oh, god.
what?
I just spent two days running all over creation thinking you were kid napped or dead.
half the hobosin albuquerque are in mourning for you.
cook's facing murder charges. And you have the balls to shush me?
cook killed someone? - Yeah, apparently you.
now start explaining. What is going on?
again with the shushing. - Listen.
come here, come here.
let us pray.
look at her.
she says it's bad manners to look at your feet when talking to god.
six years ago, I was in a deep crisis.
not what people like to calla crisis of faith.
I never doubted god's existence.
I just couldn't find him.
it was like he was avoiding me.
it's a terrible thing to be snubbed by the creator.
so I began attending mass at a different church every day.
seven churches, seven masses, seven days. Sometimes even more.
and on the 17th day, in a small cathedral south of Boston during the liturgy of the eucharist.
I looked over...
and that's what I saw.
I'd never seen anyone with god before.
but you know, that's not enough to sustain a man and a woman.
we've always had god, but never have each other.
you faked your death to get away from Ruth?
no, No, it's god's will, Mary.
he spoke to me through the burning jeep.
he called that poor soul who died in my truck home to end his suffering, and mine, and Ruth's.
how much blood did you lose?
I'm not delusional. God did speak to me.
he said I should hide myself here in his house and pray.
and when my injuries healed, I should leave this place.
ruth will find happiness.
and I'll continue doing his work in another city.
this is god's will, Mary. It's what he wants.
you don't believe.
I believe you believe.
and I can't think of anyone who deserves to be happy in this life more than you and Ruth.
it's ridiculous. Everybody has these suspicious minds.
they automatically assume the worst.
like can't two attractive heterosexual people just be friends?
not in my experience.
Oh, it's Raph.
probably wants me to come over and do his taxes or snake his toilet.
what?
I just have to say a few things, okay?
look, I think that for the good of everybody it's...
probably best if we stop hanging out.
what? That's crazy?
just because we had some stupid moments we can't be friends anymore?
okay, that's ridiculous. Nothing happened. And nothing will happen.
what are you, three?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Chico, cut it out. Chico?
according to the gospel of Don, god told Don to free himself and Ruth from the surly bonds of their loveless marriage.
he said that their union had fulfilled his purpose.
and now Don was to leave Ruth with the belief he had perished so that they might both go out and find happiness on earth.
don, being the lord'sfaithful servant, was loathe to disobey.
and jesus came upon two brothers who were fishing in the sea of Galilee.
and said unto them,"follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people."
what's that got to dowith it?
the FBI just picked up the connor brothers on a fishing boat in the gulf of California with 400 pounds of Mexican heroin in the hold.
before Don limped off into the desert night, he asked god, "lord, you have commanded me to be happy, "but you haven't told me how?"
please, lord, what does it take for two people to be happy?
but the lord had said all that he would say.
I got to stop.
great idea!
Oh, I'm sorry. Did we get you?
gee, you think? - Oh, here.
here you go.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
here, touch me - you'll make it even.
no, thank you.
I... That didn't come out right.
what a jerk!
all right, all right!
let go! - Man, sober up.
dude, you okay?
I'll drop you off back at base, man.
no, no, no, I'm just going to walk. Shake the stink off.
play with me.
please... play with me. Play with me.
Yes, they came in this morning.
in fact, I'm wearing them right now.
Oh, yes. They feel really, really good when I move.
I have to get to work.
Yeah, I'm going to have to call you back.
Yeah, I,uh... I miss you too, Ray.
Yeah. Okay, bye.
I do.
and I do not care who knows.
well, sounds like you're getting pretty serious.
I am happy. Ray is happy.
we are meeting in New York, next weekend.
he's taking me to the opera.
the opera?
does his boyfriend know about you?
no, but his mom does.
you've met the rents?
when are we going to get to meet him?
all in good time, McGee.
and how is your... special new someone?
I don't have a special anything. And it's none of your business.
huh! Well, someone's keeping secrets.
that's pretty classic, coming from the woman who's kept her...
boyfriend hidden from us for months.
I'm not hiding anything.
ray knows all about you.
again, why haven't we met him?
because Ray knows all about you.
I'm not the one you should be worried about, right?
I've seen men of steel melt from a mere glance from Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
that flinty, steel-eyed stare that makes those men turn into sniveling little girls.
it's just... Morning, boss.
grab your gear.
got a dead Naval officer in Virginia.
Hey, Duck. Think we could get a better look at this?
he's wrapped up tighter than a Thanksgiving turkey.
his ankles are bound. That's odd.
well, we'll move as fast as we can.
might want to move a little faster.
looks like the locals want to get back to work.
well, they probably didn't expect him to be part of their spring crop.
although human remains would make a... excellent fertilizer.
Oh, that is stinky.
Ooh, yeah. Just a little.
Yeah, throat's cut.
and a deep cut at that.
had a pet gerbil when I was a kid.
I, uh, buried him in my mother's vegetable garden after he died.
and that year, her plum tomatoes were better than ever.
I used to think of him every time I bit into one, and...
cause he-he was talking about the, uh, fertilizer...
so, uh... You're right. I'm sorry, sorry.
skin is dehydrated.
decomposition has set in.
how long ago?
uh, my guess - four to five days.
he's extremely clean.
there's no defensive wounds.
no obvious signs of a struggle.
no blood pooling.
I'd say he was killed somewhere else and left here.
Gibbs, the farm's owner says he has only seen his employees around this area the past week.
that's about half a mile from the road.
no street lamps.
easy to come and go without being seen.
police report someone found a wallet and a watch in a dumpster near town.
no one claimed it.
you get an I. D?
uh, it was empty except for about 50 bucks.
whoever killed the captain wasn't after his cash.
uh, this is not a captain.
seaman Derek Balfour.
whoever killed him could have played dress-up.
something is in his lapel here, Doctor.
it's a Metro card.
based on the date stamp, purchased after his time of death.
Jethro, take a look at this.
this young man's gaze has been altered, postmortem.
Yeah, someone physically adjusted his eyeballs.
combine where they're looking now, with the Metro card and, uh...
what is he looking toward?
D. C.
it's a message.
seaman Derek Balfour.
22. Enlisted three years ago, stationed at Norfolk.
scheduled to ship out next week for a second tour to the Middle East.
service record?
C. O. says he's likeable, but a bit of a loose cannon.
not captain material, boss.
he was dedicated, though.
seaman Balfour lacks the skills necessary for promotion,yet has great devotion to the Navy.
he works harder than anyone else.
and played even harder.
written up for a drunk-and-disorderly, six months ago-mandatory alcohol counseling.
passed with flying colors. Not a blemish on his record since.
did he have a family?
mom's in Rhode Island.
they've been estranged for years.
dad was never in the picture. No siblings.
left home when he was 15;
supported himself with odd jobs until he joined the Navy.
a friend of Seaman Balfour's says they were at a D. C. club together last Thursday night.
they had several beers, and left separately around 1: 00 a. m.
okay, phone records, e- mails, financials. - On it.
I thought you were in Miami.
I lied. I was in the parking lot.
you have been very creepy today.
sneaky. And yes, I have.
but for a very good cause.
introductions, Ziva?
um, uh, right. Of course.
uh, Ray Cruz... this is everyone.
special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
pleasure, sir.
agent Timothy McGee. - How are you?
Tony DiNozzo. - Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo. It's a pleasure.
special Agent. Heard good things.
Yeah. Likewise.
friend of Ziva's is a friend of ours.
of course, the last time she had an out- of- town visitor, our director ended up in the hospital.
well, I come in peace. Promise.
and despite the injuries your director sustained, the agency thinks that you navigated that situation very well.
you CIA?
just celebrated my 13th year, sir.
that's funny.
Ziva failed to mention your line of work.
well, that's what I do. It's - it's not who I am.
that's a very Zen, New- Agey kind of attitude for someone who installs puppet regimes for a living.
okay. Uh, Gibbs, can I give Ray a tour?
Yeah, sure.
don't lose him.
it's been a pleasure meeting all of you.
so it's not Renaissance Ray.
it's CIA Ray. He's "CI-Ray."
you really should get that checked out. It's like a bad tick or something.
there's something about this guy, boss.
his smile is disturbing.
haven't seen a smile like that since Christian Bale's barely audible Batman in The Dark Knight.
DiNozzo. - Right. Back to work.
it's what I do, not who I am.
What's...?
it's just so weird.
so many Naval decorations for the low man on the totem pole.
sorry. No offense.
actually, Mr. Palmer, if Seaman Balfour had been totemized,
as it were, he would have been much closer to the top.
I don't follow.
native Americans designed their poles so that the lower you were on it, the higher they held you in esteem.
calling someone "low man on the totem pole" is, in fact, a compliment.
so all these years, Gibbs has been complimenting me.
Oh, I wouldn't go that far, Palmer.
how far are you getting, Duck?
as far as the evidence will allow - not very.
however, Seaman Balfour, here, died from loss of blood from a severed carotid artery.
a six-centimeter-deep cut.
they knew what they were doing.
and they knew not to leave anything behind.
the body was thoroughly cleansed.
I mean, I've been over it twice, Jethro.
there's nothing - no trace of blood, no fingerprints, no strand of hair.
Additionally... - Oh, the fingernails on both hands were just cut.
well, manicured is more like it.
and the skin is abraded in places where the person scrubbed so hard.
meticulous.
not to mention well-trained.
Oh, we did find traces of a rare, high-grade cleanser.
Abby is running tests.
medical background? - Perhaps.
but I wouldn't rule out someone from law enforcement, either.
someone who knows the value of a clean corpse.
greetings, Director.
what brings you to the nether regions of our building?
I am so sorry.
I had no idea that that was your parking spot.
I swear. - At ease, Palmer.
I'm just here to check on the case.
heard there were some unusual characteristics about it.
still putting it together.
I'm not here to disrupt that; just to get an update.
is that a problem?
no.
just don't see you down here much.
things change.
Dr. Mallard, tell me what you know so far.
right. Let me call you back.
Ah, Agent - sorry - Special Agent DiNozzo.
C. I. Ray.
need to get that?
it can wait. Just wrapping up an old case.
anything interesting?
can't talk about it.
C. I. Ray business?
Yep.
so, uh... How long you in town?
as long as Ziva will have me for.
Yeah, she's a tough nut to crack.
but, you know, once you navigate past that Mossad-influenced exterior and her inability to grasp cultural references, she's great.
I'm in love with her.
that's why I'm here.
to tell her? When are you going to do that?
I don't know.
tonight, tomorrow - soon.
you know, it feels good to finally get it out.
I'll bet.
you know, I want Ziva's friends to become my friends.
she's told me how close the two of you are.
I wouldn't say that.
well, she says you're like a brother to her.
meeting.
do me a favor - don't say anything to Ziva.
Hey, I gotta go.
where are you off to?
I have to see an old associate, but it shouldn't take too long, okay?
somebody sure left in a hurry.
he has work to do.
Yeah, so do we. Tell me what we got.
navy server showed nothing unusual in Seaman Balfour's e-mails.
but I did find this.
bank shows several charges on his debit card over the past four days.
various stores, various amounts.
dead guy on a shopping spree.
surveillance video?
Abby's still analyzing.
but so far, we've got no clear shot of the person taking Balfour's identity.
seaman Balfour's apartment manager says that someone has been staying in his apartment since last Friday.
day after he was murdered. - You got a description?
white male, unknown age.
is he there now?
manager saw him go into the unit this morning, but never come out.
DiNozzo, come on, let's go.
it's 203.
if you need, I got the key.
NCIS. Open up.
clear, boss.
tidy.
not a thing out of place.
except for this.
that is one empty refrigerator.
what the hell is that?
he likes leaving things behind.
what? You just happened to be in the neighborhood, Special Agent Barrett?
flower, huh?
that's a new one.
I'm going to take a look around, see what else I can find.
see what you can find?
I've been tracking the killer the past nine months.
three dead Navy men in three different ports.
what's your connection?
case started in Rota, Spain.
Rota. - Never been there. Hear it's nice.
seaman Balfour's murder fits the pattern, right down to the funny little ice cubes.
my killer, my case.
what I was thinking is we...
I'll have to call you back.
I take it Agent Barrett got settled in.
Yeah, for the second time.
you could have told me, Director.
it was need-to-know.
you didn't, so what's the problem?
you kept me in the dark... on purpose?
it just landed on our soil, Gibbs.
I'm telling you now.
called the Port-to-Port Killer.
victims are all Navy enlisted.
bodies found near bases in Sasebo, Guam, Rota.
M. O.'s the same every time: throats cut, redressed, thoroughly cleaned and wrapped in plastic.
no physical evidence left behind.
but he does always leave some kind of object.
that's a signature. - Maybe.
bread crumbs.
left this near the last body in Guam.
a peanut?
boiled. Grown in southeastern Virginia.
suggests that the killer may be on his way to the States.
agent Barrett was brought in last month in anticipation of that move.
unfortunately, we were right.
Balfour was the latest victim.
but he won't be the last.
the SecNav wants the Port-to-Port Killer found and locked up fast.
I suggest you get past your issues with E. J.running the lead on this and find him.
you're quiet.
I'm pensive.
if this is some kind of game, I'm not playing.
no game.
Oh, I get it. You don't like it when I play boss lady.
would have been nice to know you'd be showing up out of the blue like this.
you just saw me last night.
Yes, in my apartment, wearing my Elvis Costello T-shirt which was extremely gratifying, but I didn't expect you at my crime scene - sifting through my evidence.
technically, it was my crime scene and my evidence.
well, technically, you could have mentioned it.
it wasn't something I could share.
maybe it was something you didn't want to share.
that thing is pissing me off.
just move this... And...
what?
the skylight and the computer screen - a way to avoid awkward moments.
intriguing.
a riddle wrapped in a mystery wrapped in an enigma.
Joe Pesci, Oliver Stone's JFK - nice.
winston Churchill, Russia, 1939.
smarty-pants.
I don't think this is going to work out.
not with us on the same case. We should stop.
okay.
okay. Best we end it.
or not.
dinner my place?
I'll bring wine.
got anything, Abbs?
it's just that our crazed lunatic killer also happens to be a plant lover.
after comparing the flower that was found in Seaman Balfour's apartment to dozens of species that are indigenous to North America, I got a match.
behold the Pogonia ophioglossoides.
also known as the Snake-Mouth Orchid.
it's a rare species, Gibbs - so rare it's been put on the endangered list in several states.
Yeah, so?
so, if P2P- Port-to-Port Killer- I made that up myself- if P2P wants to grow one, he would have to do it himself, or find someone who could.
he knows his plants.
Oh, that's not all he knows.
seaman Balfour's wounds were clean - there were no ragged edges.
the angle and the bevel of the cut run in a straight line, so our weapon is...
surgical.
Yep, and it's a perfect match to this.
I also matched the cleanser that was found on the body.
it's an iodine-based scrub called Xeonphine.
it's made in Canada, and it's only sold to hospitals.
so... we're looking for someone in the medical field?
what, a doctor maybe?
Yeah, or a, a - a surgeon or a nurse maybe.
Abbs, do you need a doctor?
no, it's just... change, Gibbs.
change makes me itch.
it always has.
it's - it's Agent Barrett.
I'm not a fan. I mean, of change.
her - I don't mind.
she's feisty for someone so small.
um, and I like that.
not that I like her, because I don't really...
Abby. - Not like I like you.
Abbs. - I just - I like our family just the way it is.
nothing's going to change.
I do not trust her.
and I know that Gibbs does not trust her.
but she will be here running lead until we solve this case.
I mean throwing in someone new - it's never a good idea.
never.
I'm sorry. I'm rambling.
okay, so enough about my day.
how was the meeting with your associate?
can we talk about something other than work?
just - just for a while?
a very little while?
there's something that I want to tell you.
okay.
I... Ignore it.
wait.
okay. I'm sorry.
that was... that was McGee.
he had a question.
what did you need to tell me?
nothing.
it can wait.
the Port-to-Port Killer is a highly egotistical individual.
he's lethal and determined and... You're all welcome to join me.
I'm not really into yelling from way over here.
Yeah, we can hear you fine.
keep going.
suspect is a white male anywhere from 25 to 55, never married, no children.
born into money, he is charming, charismatic and very entitled.
are you sure we're not looking for Tony?
he's killed in Japan, Guam, Spain and now the U. S.
no connection between any of his victims besides the fact that they're all Navy or former Navy.
he is well-traveled, multilingual, adapts to other cultures easily.
and as you know, his M. O. suggests he has medical training of some kind.
doesn't tell us why he gives them a promotion before he dumps them.
or why he leaves things behind.
the flower from Balfour's apartment told us nothing.
could indicate where he's going next.
I think he's still here.
and he's not leaving anytime soon.
is that a hunch, Special Agent Barrett?
we're talking about a pathological individual!
he's smart, incredibly high-achieving...- Oh, I doubt it.
I think that these murders are his biggest achievement.
that a hunch, Agent Gibbs?
boss, I got something here you should see.
excuse me.
it's from Seaman Balfour's personal e-mail cache; most recent was the morning of his death.
you're crazy if you think "you're getting away with this, Balfour.
I'll kill you before that happens.
you got a name, McGee?
Yep. 24-year-old Bryce Leitner, heir to the Leitner timber fortune.
dropped out of med school two years ago, been traveling the world ever since.
and he has visited Japan, Guam and Spain in the past year.
do you have a location?
last known local address is a condo in Georgetown.
we can be done in ten minutes, or here all day. It's up to you.
I'm not saying anything.
let's talk about Sasebo, Japan.
why were you there?
starting without me, Special Agent Barrett?
we're just getting settled in.
you're in my chair.
need to know why you traveled so much the last year, Mr. Leitner.
you've been in D. C. two weeks? - Yeah.
and before you arrived here, you were in Europe and Southeast Asia.
we have e-mails you sent threatening Seaman Balfour's life.
yeah? So?
I hated the guy.
next time I see you, I'll take your head off.
it's a figure of speech.
Really? - Yeah.
I find that funny.
that's almost what the killer did.
you were in Japan, Guam, Spain - Where were you a week ago?
let him answer my question, Agent Gibbs.
why the threats to Balfour?
because that loser made a move on my girl.
can you believe that?
low-class piece of...
and just to spite me, she actually goes out with the jerk.
so I get screwed twice.
tell me, Bryce, what's it like to have it all?
the looks, the money, world travel... the women?
excuse us.
there are standards in there.
rules.
I can interrogate him however I want.
different strokes, Gibbs. You weren't getting anywhere with him and he's my suspect.
that's my room.
Vance put me in charge.
Vance isn't here.
I'm trying to establish that he was in all four cities at the same time of the murders.
focus on Balfour.
that's our body, that's our evidence, that's our case!
this is a multiple murder case!
start by pinning one murder on him, and then connect the others. That's how it's done.
maybe that's the old-school way.
it's my way.
I'm calling Vance.
I'll be talking to Leitner.
are you questioning whether I know what I'm doing, Agent Gibbs?
no, ma'am. I'm questioning the way you do it.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
Yeah, Abbs, I'll be right there.
where are you going?
wherever you are.
did you guys have a fight?
Yes. - No.
excuse me.
Abbs, what do you got?
okay, so I ran Bryce Leitner's name through every intelligence and law enforcement database - AFIS, Interpol, DIA, CIA.
point, Abby?
Abbs, come on.
okay, so Leitner's in the system because of a DUl charge in Virginia last year.
okay. And? - And he gave blood.
what does that have to do with it?
only everything.
that, my fearless leader, is the Spanish fishing village of Rosa Verde.
there was a viral outbreak there last July.
about a thousand people were infected.
Leitner's blood had traces of the pertussis virus.
exactly. Which means...
he was in Spain at the same time as the Rota murder.
and he was here in D. C. on the date that Balfour was killed.
looks like my suspect is panning out, Agent Gibbs.
do you want to talk about it?
I'm telling you, you mess with the Great White, you're gonna get eaten.
I'm not afraid of him.
that's your first mistake.
look, there's a pretty good chance I just caught the Port-to-Port Killer.
besides, Gibbs isn't exactly in Vance's good graces these days.
there's your second mistake.
I get the feeling they're not on the best of terms, and Vance outranks him.
okay... I've seen a few directors come and go.
there's only been one Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
do the math.
Yeah, and there's only one Anthony DiNozzo.
actually, there are two.
you know, this case may take me more than a few weeks for me to wrap up.
And?
and I'm just saying, I could get used to this.
I like the city life and these offices, despite that ridiculous skylight.
well, you get used to that.
well, then maybe your coworkers could get used to the idea of me being here on a more...
permanent basis.
I look at you and how you've made this place work for yourself.
and it's your home.
it's all about the people around you.
Yeah.
I'm starting to get that.
agent David, C.I. Ray.
stop calling him that.
it's okay. I kinda like it.
agent Cruz.
wait - uh, do you two know each other?
well, yeah. Didn't he tell you?
tell me what?
ray's our CIA liaison with NCIS on the Port-to- Port Killer case.
he has been from the start.
look, I... - No.
okay, well, you lied to me, Ray. I mean, what does the CIA call it?
do the call it "disinformation"? A cover story?
I was protecting you, okay?
I do not need protection!
it was need-to-know information.
I was not allowed to tell you, period.
did you sleep with Agent Barrett?
no, no. And if I did, I would have told you about it.
I didn't come here for this case, Ziva.
I came here for you.
Oh, just stop it! Stop it!
was any of it real? - Yes.
were you just planning on using me to get information, just in case things with Barrett didn't pan out?
I mean, was that it?!
I mean, am I part of this back-up plan?
no, you're overreacting.
Oh, my gosh! You want to see me overreact, Ray?
why don't you tell me another lie?
why don't you tell me the sky is yellow?
why don't you tell me that water is not wet or that sand is not dry?
why don't you tell me that you love me?
I love you.
I love you, Ziva.
I don't believe you.
what about our time in Miami, huh?
the trips?
what about the romantic dinners? I mean, was...
was that all part of your plan?
it was real. - It is real.
we are real.
I wish I could believe you.
you have the wrong guy.
Leitner- he's not the Port-to-Port Killer.
he's a mule for the Syrian government.
we've been watching his every move for the last 16 months, and there's no way he could have killed any of them.
you didn't hear this from me.
Gibbs, I got to talk to you.
I need to tell you something.
I cannot tell you how I know this, and you cannot ask.
all right. Tell me what?
Bryce Leitner is not the Port-to-Port Killer.
how sure are you?
very.
okay.
turns out our chief suspect isn't the Port-to-Port Killer.
how can you be so sure?
reliable source.
how reliable? - Very.
well, what's that supposed to mean?
it means Leitner has alibis for all three international murders.
still leaves our local body.
McGee, Balfour: crime scene photos. Put'em up.
look, I've been on this case for nine months.
I've studied every piece of evidence; I've studied these photos a hundred times in the last 24 hours.
Yeah, well, we're going to study them again.
go close-up on his decorations.
what?
service Warfare Pin.
four Navy air medals.
distinguished Flying Cross.
there's no way a Black Shoe could have a Distinguished Flying Cross and four air medals.
boss, this guy should have pilot wings.
so the killer made a mistake when re-dressing the victim?
has he ever made a mistake before?
never. The guy's meticulous.
this is a message. He wanted us to see these.
McGee, put up a map of the murders.
all port cities. I've already been over this.
airports?
and I've already checked the flight manifests for all passengers...
not interested in passengers.
hubs. - Hubs?
hubs.
MTAC, now.
stay.
told you not to play with the Great White.
homeland just had FAA transfer all encrypted flight watch data.
do it.
airlines servicing all four cities where the Port-to-Port Killer struck.
well, there's four airlines that service Sasebo and Guam, but not Rota.
there's only one that services all three cities and D. C. - Espree Airlines.
they go to all four international hubs, as well as Reagan and Dulles.
cities are transfer points.
meaning stopover points for pilots, flight crew, stewards and maintenance workers.
checking the employee records for Espree Airlines.
all right.
now these are the names of the various flight personnel who had stopovers in the cities where the Port-to-Port murders occurred.
how many served in the U. S. Navy?
six.
how many were in all four cities at the times of all four murders?
one.
Nathan Finney, U.S. Navy, retired.
put him up.
f-18 jockey, top of his Top Gun class in San Diego.
served in Gulf Wars One and Two.
that explains the decorations.
80 bombing sorties in downtown Baghdad.
our killer's a war hero?
give me an address.
just outside Alexandria.
clear.
clear.
clear.
nothing here, boss.
out here!
Nathan Finney, with a bad case of freezer burn.
heat wave in Autopsy.
I guess there really is global warming.
Yeah, Autopsy is indeed topsy-turvy today, Mr. Palmer.
nice alliteration Doctor.
what do we got?
based on the depth, angle of penetration, and the keenness of the blade, I'd say it was...
same scalpel as the murders.
Yes. Carotid artery and windpipe severed with great precision.
you have a time of death?
I'd say he's been dead and frozen for at least six weeks.
so you've got one more dead body, but no Port-to-Port Killer, is that right?
we're confident we're closing in.
good, because SecNav tasked me to solve this case.
so, I'm to tell him what?
we got a bouquet of flowers, some more ice, and no suspects.
I put both of you on this case to double the chances of catching this lunatic.
now I'm wondering if I didn't double his chances of escaping.
look, I don't care how you do it- together, apart, mean, nice- just get it done.
so I guess we're still partners.
see you in the morning, Special Agent Barrett.
you sleeping with DiNozzo?
it's not against NCIS policy to date co-workers.
it's against my policy.
this team operates on respect.
you don't respect me... - No.
I don't trust you.
Really? - Really.
except to work the case, leave my team alone.
we clear?
shouldn't drink alone; it's too depressing.
it's a club soda, and I'm not depressed.
well... I wouldn't blame you. It's been a rough day.
maybe for you.
I'm fine.
if you were fine, you wouldn't be here.
okay, then. Let's go.
I would like a drink.
and it is depressing to drink alone.
Barkeep!
anything old and gold. I might be getting a cold.
sorry. Scotch on the rocks. Thank you.
comin' up!
he's CIA.
they have a sworn duty to protect what they know.
same as we do.
he was just doing his job.
he lied to me, Tony.
Yeah. Because...
he cares about you.
does not matter, because it's over.
scotch, sir.
what about you and EJ?
what about us?
what are you going to do when Gibbs finds out?
I understand this one, Ziva. I understand her.
that's why it's working.
this is for you.
I didn't order that.
guy in the booth did.
I wonder who?
hi I'm Chuck.
here are a few things, that you might need to know: Wait...
Vivian Volkoff is trying to kill me?
it appears she's going after the man who took down her father.
Captain: I've got some bad news.
Ellie's been working on your dad's computer.
my dad was trying to figure out a way to input knowledge into the human brain without having to learn it.
CHUCK: Replace the computer's hard drive with a blank one when Ellie's not looking.
I'm great Mom, you know?
uh, she's sleeping halfway through the night, now.
and Devon has that breast-feeding simulator which is great, so...
I'm-I'm fine.
you know I love babysitting my granddaughter, but I am a trained spy.
what gives?
I didn't want to say anything until I had any solid conclusions, but...
is that your father's old computer?
Yeah. I found it underneath the seat of his Mustang.
I had a major breakthrough a few days ago, and then I found thousands of pages that I've never seen before, all labeled X.
how far into them are you?
not very.
but there's references in here to you and Dad, and this Agent X.
do you... know anything about this?
no. Did you happen to run this by your brother?
no. I don't want Chuck involved.
I mean, obviously this has to do with Dad's spy life.
look at this.
this Intersect project: downloading information into the human brain.
this is amazing stuff.
I've never heard of it.
do you think that Dad actually had the Intersect up and running with this Agent X?
I really don't know, honey. I don't know.
all right. I'm going to go give Clara her bottle.
I'll be back.
: Oh, Stephen, what did you do?
eddard, you don't let your kids keep a direwolf.
that's a terrible idea.
are you ready to head out?
will you sign these when you get a chance?
just wedding prep docs.
prospective husband... Prospective wife...
Walker, the Somali pirates want to take him.
if you go in with all that firepower, it's gonna be a bloodbath.
if you want Charles out alive, I need to be there.
fine.
I can't go like this. They'd laugh.
let me get a little something out of my prison kit. Please.
pick a game.
dice, roulette, cards. You win, the tracker is yours.
I win, you die.
do you have Uno?
honestly, sweetheart, I copied one file to cross-reference in the CIA database, but when I put the flash drive in, it disappeared.
well, Mom, why didn't you say anything?
I know it's important to you, working with your dad's computer.
and I just, I felt stupid.
well, it's okay.
the computer automatically embeds the backup files in the hard drive, so I didn't lose anything.
Oh, good! Good. - Yeah.
honey, if we're gonna make that reservation, we should get going.
okay.
okay.
okay.
okay.
go on! Get out of here! Have some fun!
all right. We'll see you in a few hours.
okay.
Ellie, let's drop this plan and actually go to dinner.
Devon, the woman has the technical savvy of Steve Jobs.
she didn't just "erase" a file.
so we're gonna stand out here in the cold and wait for her to maybe do something?
we didn't have to wait very long, did we?
she's doing it!
okay, um, she's spending the night, we follow her in the morning, and we see what she's doing with the file.
el, we're not spies.
Devon, we are gonna act like it because she's keeping something from me and I want to know why.
the tracking device.
draw four.
you're a cheater! You just cheated! He cheated. He just cheated.
I just saw you palm a card out of your...
tell it to St. Peter, dead man!
Hello, Ellyas.
VOLKOFF: You cheated. Give him the targeting device.
you are supposed to be locked up.
what the hell is happening here?
I'm gonna show you what the hell's going on here.
your morality is in a state of development.
for once in your life, you're gonna play fair.
the tracking device or your life.
take it. It's yours.
thank you.
we do have one problem.
what's the problem, Volkoff?
there's something I've gotta do. And it's gonna be really painful.
Casey, we need to get out of here right now.
got it. Let's roll.
come on, Alexei, we gotta go now!
you know me, you know what I'm capable of, Ellyas.
the time's come for me...
for me to...
apologize.
I want you to understand that I... like all other men...
I'm still a work in progress.
what do you say, Ellyas? Forgive and forget, right?
okay?
okay...
go!
CHUCK: Okay, okay.
give me that. - I feel so free!
CHUCK: Do you? That's good.
thanks so much for your time. Such a good feeling, isn't it?
here we go. Let's go.
thank you, Mogadishu, and good night!
VOLKOFF: All that remains is the killing agent... thorium.
my finest piece of work.
where does it come from? - A far-off land.
to mine it, I had to wage war against the peaceful natives and ordered the destruction of their Hometree.
I'm just kidding.
they showed it to us last week... Avatar.
so it's rare. Incredibly.
and the chances you don't know its location are pretty slim.
well, my grandmother always used to say, play your cards close to the vest.
and wear a coat over the vest or you'll look like a jerk.
team, good progress, but Langley is getting antsy.
well, General, we think Volkoff knows where the killing agent is, but he's being very uncool about it.
VOLKOFF: General... I want proof you're going to keep your side of the bargain.
there is a classified document on the conference table...
a communication between Vivian and the CIA.
it's been redacted, but you'll get the gist.
I guess you're just going to have to trust us.
thorium's in a Swiss military bunker. The locks are coded to my DNA.
we fly at midnight. Fuel my jet.
you don't have a jet.
of course. Old thinking. It creeps back.
let's creep back to your cell. Come on.
okay, honey, I'll call next week. And if you need anything, you call me.
okay. - Thank you.
Bye.
target's on the move, Hot Mama.
ELLIE: Copy that, Six Pack. You get the car. I got the baby.
meet me at 8: 00, the shooting range to celebrate.
love, Alex.
Hey, I just got your text. What's going on?
your sister is breaking through the firewalls of the Orion computer.
what? No. No, no, no, no.
I mean, I knew about that, but I had Awesome take out the hard drive and disable it.
well, he didn't. And the progress she's making in her access...
it's almost as if your father intended for her to find out about the Intersect.
Oh, my God.
I've taken files piecemeal.
I think I got the dangerous ones, but she's onto me.
she's following me.
okay. Okay. Let's think about this. Let's think about this.
what are we going to do?
the time has come for her to find out what it is you do for the CIA.
no. Mom, we've been down that road before... okay?
and if she gets the truth now, she could end up resenting me for all the lies I've told, and it'll tear us apart.
well, she is finding out on her own, which could be infinitely worse.
our family has relied on secrets and lies for way too long.
CASEY: Bartowski. Beckman's on the monitor.
I'll be right there.
not you, Bartowski; the other Bartowski. She says it's urgent.
we'll discuss later.
okay.
general, I'd like this second file from Orion's computer to be the last that I acquire.
it's not going to be easy to keep secrets from my daughter much longer.
cards on the table?
washington is hungry to expand the Intersect program, and Ellie has unlocked material our best technicians couldn't get near.
we've never even heard of Agent X.
well, neither have I, but that does not mean that it's related to the Intersect.
still, it seems like Ellie has exclusive access.
the director wants her to keep working.
Diane, she's not a spy. She's my daughter.
Mary, I'm sorry, but it comes from the top.
Volkoff is here?
what the hell is going on?
he got a 48-hour furlough to get us a weapon called the Norseman.
it-it wasn't in your Volkoff file, but have you heard of it?
just whispered about. Never laid eyes on it, which is worrisome.
watch your back, Chuck.
maybe he's a changed man. He asked to see you, to make amends.
we're talking about Alexei Volkoff. His mind is twisted.
never believe a word he says, and never let him out of your sight.
you understand?
cool.
swiss alps
Sarah: No guns, no ambush. Maybe this isn't a trap after all.
Yeah. Can't trust a Limey with good teeth.
well, we have Mr. Cool in there.
what do we have to worry about? Bartowski, we lose audio, we're coming in.
sounds good, buddy.
the thorium is behind this door.
first, to get in, you got to win the game of chess.
it's fully automated and constantly evolving. Plus, there's a five-minute clock.
I'm guessing there's consequences if you lose.
: Oh, yeah.
well, you don't have to stay. You can wait with your friends.
well, Alexei, as much as I like staying away from life-threatening situations, wherever you go...I go.
fasten your seat belt.
it's going to be a bumpy match.
electronic VOICE: Welcome, Mr. Volkoff. Ready to play a game?
CHUCK: Alexei, just stay cool.
I know you don't like Bartowski's groovy attitude.
God knows where he gets these ideas.
Yeah, well, it kind of threw me when he just signed that prenup.
that's what you would have done.
exactly, but now I see what Chuck's side of it would have been like.
flipping out about our relationship boiled down to the contents of an envelope.
seeing the end before we've even started.
so why the prenup?
I have some money socked away, in case my dad gets arrested again.
well, I'm sure Bartowski could handle it.
any excuse to weep and hug.
Yeah, well, it's more about what it dredges up for me.
my relationship with my family and having to take sides.
caught between your parents, huh?
tough place to be.
hardest place for a kid is right in the middle.
Roger that.
electronic VOICE: Check, Mr. Volkoff.
Oh, shake it off. Shake it off. Shake it off. You're doing great.
you're still in check, Mr Volkoff. If this is Mr. Volkoff.
guns. Big guns.
lots of bullets.
sort of overkill.
story of my life.
what is going on with you? Come on. Let's do this.
I used to love games like this. I didn't care whether I lived or died.
now I do care. I don't want to die.
I'm going to lose, and I'm going to die.
no, you're not. No, you're not going to die.
we're not going to die right now. Look...
I get that you're trying to better yourself, but would a spiritual man freeze in the face of adversity?
would he...
would he choke and die so close to fixing things with his daughter?
no, he wouldn't, because he'd be cool.
it's not working. - Damn it!
you still have the DNA of the world's most evil weapons dealer.
you are a villain, sir.
your name strikes fear in the hearts of even the toughest of swine.
and that name is...
alexei Volkoff. You say it like you mean it!
my name... is...
world's biggest bad-ass.
killer of men, conqueror of nations.
let's not get ahead of ourselves. Game, guns, clock.
CHUCK: What's going on?
right into my trap.
checkmate.
good. Now, let's get a move on before the computer changes its mind, okay?
we're losing audio.
what is that we're picking up? Is that Russian?
Yeah. Go. - We need to go.
the last level of security is coded to my DNA.
I assume that's the thorium. Let's get this over with.
we'll get to that.
but first, I have an amends to make to you.
Oh, yeah? Well, uh, I'm pretty well aware of all the bad things that you've done, and I'm learning not to hold it against you.
it's not what I've done. It's what I'm about to do.
we just picked up some Russian on the radio. How long is this gonna take?
see, you were right. I'm Alexei Volkoff.
and always will be.
w-wait, wait, wait, wait. What is happening?
Oh, this is what we call the twist.
I have a company to run and I need leverage to run it.
the Norseman's the most dangerous weapon in the world.
I just needed my father's DNA to get the killing agent.
what? So this is a setup?
you were shot.
you two never communicated. - Yes, we did.
: the minute... the minute you showed me the Norseman component,
I knew it was a message from my daughter.
you and I are gonna run this company together.
there will be plenty of time for that, Father.
the thorium is useless without the other components.
the other components are what's useless.
they can be rebuilt.
but you'll never have this.
place the grenades.
VOLKOFF: Now, Viv, darling, get these handcuffs off your, off your father.
we've got a lot of work to do.
I'm sorry, Dad, but here's the real twist.
dead by your own plasma grenades, impossible to defuse.
young lady, you get me out of these handcuffs immediately.
this is your father talking.
trust no one. You taught me that.
it didn't include me.
Vivian, you are not this person. - You don't know who I am!
you have both lied to me, betrayed me and shattered my life!
VOLKOFF: Vivian, darling, I've always been on your side.
the photographs?
the necklace?
tokens from a stranger!
I don't know you.
I will never know you. Good-bye.
Vivian! Please!
come on, let's get to the bombs and see what we can do.
maybe if I can flash on the laser grid, I can get through them.
you gonna carry us on your back?
is there any other escape from this room?
she hates me.
no, she's... I'm sure she's just going through a phrase.
actually, I'm really sure she's not going through a phase, but you got to snap out of this right now.
just let me die. - We all die.
what would Dr. Nelson say?
he'd say that you're not seeing it from her side of the issue, you know?
if any part of your recovery was real, you'd see that she's just hurt and angry.
I failed her. - No!
you made a great first step in repairing your relationship.
it's just gonna take more work.
you really believe that?
Sarah: Chuck, we have to move... seconds left.
just forget about him!
hmm, modified, directed EMP.
this year's innovation.
I was gonna tell her all my secrets. We were gonna be partners.
not anymore.
: "Velcome" to the future.
CHUCK: Why did she do this?
she's my daughter.
she takes after me.
please, Charles, take me home.
I understand you wanted a minute.
Mary? You well?
what is it you wanted to say?
I've done terrible things.
I've been evil.
but I was drawn to the goodness in you.
Alexei, this is not necessary. - Yes, it is.
I was not worthy of your love...
like Orion was.
please accept my apology and know that I'm doing my best to improve.
thank you, Charles.
remember, family and friends are everything.
money, greed and power are a dance with Satan.
and he looks like me.
dad, don't say it again.
know what, we'll have dinner the day after graduation.
I don't want you lying to your mother on my behalf.
me neither, but lying to her kind of goes with our territory.
it's not fair for you to be torn between two parents. It's not okay.
you're my father.
I don't mind being in the middle, as long as that means I get to have you in my life.
I mind.
I respect that you don't want to tell your mother the truth, but...
we have to come up with a compromise. I can't be there on the day.
unless...
unless we tell your mom the truth.
that I'm alive. - Yeah.
I'll tell her the truth.
Oh, that scares me.
done. - You don't have to do that.
please forget that that ever existed, okay?
that is so not cool. - Just read it.
I, Sarah Walker, promise to... always love Chuck Bartowski.
in return, he will always love me.
I can't read this fine print.
the fine print says,"I promise Chuck that I will not even "contemplate the word 'divorce.
and I will never use my prenup.
I already signed it.
Thanks.
Sarah, I have to talk to Ellie right now or I'll lose my nerve, I know it.
Yeah, your mother is right.
Ellie's better off finding out from you than on her own.
should I finish my wine first? - Come on, she'll understand.
Chuck, being a spy isn't just what you do, but it's about who you are.
go and tell her.
Thanks. Be right back.
Hey, El. - Hi.
uh, Devon's putting the baby down.
let's, uh, let's go over here.
that's some look you got on your face.
I heard that you've been kind of busy lately.
Yeah.
a newborn will do that to you. - Yeah, uh, that's true.
Chuck, is there anything pressing going on? 'Cause, really, I should get dinner started.
el, I need to talk to you about Dad's computer.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I thought that I uncovered some secret files.
turned out just to be cheats on some video game that he was developing.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Just gibberish, really.
listen, that Chicken a la King's not gonna cook itself.
so I'm gonna get in there.
okay. Yeah. - Okay.
my sister just lied to me.
she's never lied to me.
not cool.
we build the device as quickly as possible.
there was only one man my father was ever afraid of, one threat to Volkoff Industries.
he went by the name Agent X.
I'm gonna track him down and kill him.
then no one can touch me,ever.
attention!
gentlemen,
I want you to make sure you're fully loaded and ready to go.
tonight you will encounter steep resistance.
not everyone will make it.
but for the ones that do, this will be a day long remembered.
long remembered, sir!
and years after we're gone, history will remember the name Delta Ti Gamma.
sir, yes, sir. Delta Ti Gamma, sir.
okay, boys.
lock and load.
move out!
come on, let's move out.
let's go, move it, move it!
you gonna be mice or men? Let's go, freshmen!

I have to get going. Otherwise Guy will get started without me.
okay, see you tomorrow, Kira.

operation nearly compromised, but we are a go.
repeat... we are a go.
you've tried the rest, - now try the best.
Oh, gross!
Mmm. Larger or light?
light. - Well, then don't stop.
fill me up, soldier.
God! Oh, God! Greg!
so embarrassing.
why, you son of a bitch.
if I see those pictures on the Internet, you're a dead man, Greg.
a dead man, you hear me?
Greg, you're such an asshole.
I saved myself for you.
I did not know that one of my pledges was gonna do this.
I promise. I promise that I'm gonna severely chastise him.
that's what I'm gonna do, chastise him.
let me take a look at my artwork. And to think they call this a hazing.
Oh, not my best angle, but it'll do.
I hate him. So stupid.
I hate Greg. I should have known.
man #3: Oh my God. My God, are you all right, Tracy?
I can't believe I hit you. Are you okay?
I think so, Professor. I'll be okay, thanks.
too bad.
you're very beautiful. Sorry I have to do this to you.
but if all goes well, you'll be up and at 'em in a few hours.
good. No pulse.
come on.
come on!
breathe!
Oh, shit, I don't believe it.
how could it have not worked? It should have worked.
your motor functions, your higher brain functions should have all been restored.
this can't be. It's ridiculous.
I changed the sequence, the base pairs. It should work.
it must work.
even now you hold the secrets of eternal life within you.
you hold on to them, keeping me alone.
alone in the dark.
I'll never be able to bring the dead back.
my institute all gone, vanished.
it's all a foolish dream.
I failed.
I am a complete and utter failure.
reports of a disturbance by Strug Dormitory.
dispatch units.
power to overwhelm and destroy.
all obsessed with...
nature's deepest mystery. The world's most...
everything around me...
Hike!
I'm open!
Yeah!
he was cruel and a sadist.
so what is it that you do exactly, Mr. Lancaster?
come on, call me Jake, Alexandra.
okay, Jake, what is it exactly that you do?
I mean, when you're not charming the pants off the ladies, that is.
I'm a doctor. A neurologist, actually.
Really? I'm surprised you're still on the market.
just haven't found the right girl yet.
what about you?
you're online profile doesn't say much, and all I know now is that you are beautiful with a great personality.
philippe, I go on break.
Hey, buddy.
eat.
what is your problem?
you want a filet mignon, you get a job.
what is it, Jacques?
the son of a bitch bum bite my finger.
let me look at it.
keep that on it. I'll be right back.
the world has gone crazy, huh?
nobody like French people.
this entire mission was a waste of time.
we lost a lot of good men out there.
sorry, sir. I thought we were onto something this time.
you should take a look at this.
it's a new infectlon. - Is this first generation?
could be. Based on the reported outbreaks to date, we've extrapolated the point of origin there.
get me Nightingale in here right away.
you got it.
Ellis, I am sorry about your brother.
Yeah, me too.
excuse me a second. Getting paged.
could be the office calling.
someone needs, you know, brain work or something.
be right back.
Yeah, she's totally hot, man.
every time I go on one of these fucking dates they're usually heifers.
this one is a fucking babe. She's got a great rack, too.
I owe you big time. If I bag her tonight
I'll call you in the a. m. I told her I'm a fucking neurologist.
she bought it hook, line and sinker.
what happened to you? Are you all right, Philippe?
a little problem in the kitchen.
problem? Nothing serious, I hope.
no, just a...
the chef got bit.
bit? - By a homeless man.
wait.
you can't go in there.
Alexandra, where are you going?
what's going on?
you can't come back here.
Jacques.
get away from him.
what was that thing? What the hell happened to Jacques?
Hey, where are you going?
Oh, I'm sorry, Jake. I'm gonna have to take a rain check on dessert.
bag me by breakfast? I don't think so, slick.
by the way, what is it that you really do?
I'm assistant manager at Blockbuster.
Yeah, that would have been my second guess.
thanks for a lovely evening.
that was our waiter. What's wrong with him? He looks really bad.
food poisoning. I wouldn't recommend eating anything out of this kitchen.
we already did.
nightingale.
so what do you really do for a living?
I kill zombies.
Ellis: So...
what were you doing here, Nightingale?
what do you think?
well, if I knew that, I wouldn't be asking now, would I?
if you must know, I was on a date.
you on a date.
I don't believe It.
how many times I ask you out and you always said no?
cause you're a pig, Ellis. - I'm not a pig. Tom...
was a pig.
was?
he was killed last week.
at least I was the one to plant him.
God, Ellis, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.
don't say anything.
he went down fighting, both times.
he liked it that way.
we've all lost people we love.
won't be the first and certainly won't be the last.
you know, I always kinda thought you had a thing for him.
like hell I did. No offense.
none taken.
so where are we off to?
mobile unit, outside Sunnydale.
setting up for a major op. Casper will fill you in.
I'm just supposed to come fetch.
more hyper-sapiens?
what do you think?
we've lost contact with our forward recon patrols.
but before we did, they confirmed a stage one outbreak at a university campus.
Cuesta Verde... It's not far from here.
there could be some survivors. The truth is we don't know yet.
what we do know based on the analysis of the vectoring of the disease
is that It could be our grand zero for infection.
first generation? - We won't know till you can get us a sample. You'll go in with Special Forces, find any survivors, and retrieve a blood sample from the hyper-sapiens before cruise misslles destroy the entire area at 0700.
now as much as we'd like to keep a lid on this thing, we won't be able to for much longer. And I don't need to tell you what will happen if "60 Minutes" gets a hold of this story.
we don't need Special Forces for this op, sir.
AMS can handle it alone.
man #4: AMS cannot handle It alone.
says who?
says me, kiddo. - That's "sir" to you, Sergeant-Major.
I'm taking you and your men on this mission as a courtesy.
not an obligation.
get in my way, you won't just be studying the dead, you'll be joining them.
understood, sir?
gentlemen, this mission is too important for dick-waving.
I resent that, Colonel.
this is how it's gonna work. AMS will lead the science team, but you're under the jurisdiction of the Special Forces.
now as you know, AMS is an international organization.
they want this op under the strictest US operational command.
these instructions came to me directly from the Secretary of Defense.
from him from the Chiefs of Staff, and to him from the President, as instructed personally by the Vice President himself. Now as such,
I expect all of you to work and play well together and do your country proud.
Yeah, sure, whatever you say, boss.
nightingale, you're in command of the science team.
sergeant Dalton will oversee the Special Forces.
you and Ellis will answer to him. Am I understood?
understood, sir. - Understood, sir.
sergeant Dalton. - Got ya, Colonel.
nightingale, find a blood sample. I want those things eradicated.
and why don't you get cleaned up first? You look like shit.
I am so ready to get some payback on these fuckers.
what about you, Braxton?
as long as my favorite uncle's checks don't bounce,
I go where Sam sends me.
all I know is, why couldn't one of them be my ex-wife?
I mean, I would love permission to shoot her in the fucking head.
do we really need all this shit, I mean, really?
body armor makes my face look fat.
that would be affirmative, Private.
what, so you never seen a woman in her underwear before, Private?
trust me, that's the last thing you'll be thinking about come morning.
of course, this is assuming that you make it till morning, which I gotta say ain't looking very likely.
leave him alone. - Whatever.
just making conversation, Lieutenant.
you ever get the feeling that those AMS greenhorns - don't like us very much. - Nobody likes you, Bart.
how'd we end up babysitting these stuck-up sons of bitches?
Hey, I'll take all the backup I can get.
from the GI Joes?
they're soldiers. They're trained for combat.
they're trained to fight other people, other soldiers.
not these things.
we're trained to fight, period, and we've got your back.
just make sure you got ours, and maybe we'll all get to grow old one day.
or in your case, older.
she digs me.
way to win friends and influence people, Ellis.
I just don't think we need 'em. That's all.
and I say we do.
what, you got an inferiority complex now?
we start off as scientists, researchers, not soldiers.
Hey, speak for yourself.
I came here from Secret Service, not Health and Human Resources, like you. I was never a desk jockey.
I was always a fighter, not to mention a lover.
this war isn't about you, Ellis.
it's about us versus nature.
if nature wins, we're all fucked.
keep giving speeches, Nightingale. That's what you're good at.
rally the troops, "nothing to fear but fear itself..."
that kind of thing. It suits you.
I kinda like it. Gets me all hard and shit.
you just love the sound of your own voice, don't you?
pretty much, yeah.
who's the new blood?
Rodriguez... just transferred in.
replacing Garza. Also demolition expert.
well, I hope she lasts longer than he did, 'cause I would miss that ass.
I mean, when he got scragged, it was no big loss.
but her.
now that is a booty call that I would not mind making.
are you an asshole all the time, Bart?
or do you take Sundays off for good behavior?
Hey, welcome to the team.
I'm Allison Henson.
private Rodriguez, Lieutenant.
you can save the "Lieutenant" stuff for the parade ground.
in here just call me Allison.
I'm Maria.
so I saw you talking to those AMS guys back there.
what were they saying?
basically that we can't hack it.
can't wait to prove them wrong.
fuck them. When it turns into a "shit hit the fan" situation, they'll be hiding behind our pantyhose just like all the rest of those fucking science types.
science types?
Yeah, that's what Bart calls people who can read.
come on, let's roll out!
come on, come on, come on, ladies.
come on, come on.
Dalton: Hecht, HIII, you stay in the van in case we run an Oxy-12 set. Stay with the radio.
everyone else move out! Come on, let's go, let's go!
Ellis: So your men as good as they think they are, Sergeant-Major?
that's right, kiddo.
ever been in combat with these creatures?
they've been trained well.
so they've never actually been in a firefight with these things.
they don't know what it's like to look one in the eye and pull the trigger, do they?
what, are you kidding me? My team's been to hell and back.
bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq. You name it, we've been there.
so when a six-year-old girl dressed in what's left of her Sunday finest comes at 'em ready to take a bite out of 'em like they're a quarter-pounder, you're telling me they're not gonna hesitate.
they're gonna pull the trigger and do what needs to be done?
like I said, been there, done that.
now if you don't mind, we got work to do.
I don't like this, Nightingale.
I don't like this one bit.
these gung-ho marines are gonna get us killed... or worse.
what are you saying, Ellis?
watch my back. That's all I'm saying.
are you scared?
just rather not end up like my brother.
thought you of all people might be able to appreciate that...
nightingale.
I think they're gone. Don't you?
probably moved on.
we're not gonna find any hyper-sapiens here.
Nope.
too late.
missed all the action, which is too bad 'cause I was hoping for a medal out of this.
you hard as woodpecker lips, huh?
the only medal you're getting is a Purple Heart.
and it ain't gonna be for bravery.
what the hell?
hold on a second, Sergeant-Major.
what are they doing?
DNA scanner, analyzes their blood.
I'll get 'em plenty of blood to analyze if they need it.
third generation, worthless.
look at this.
what is it?
you ever seen teeth Iike that on one of them?
no, I haven't. - Neither have I.
it could be they're mutating.
that's not good, is it, Nightingale?
no.
move on out. Come on, let's go!
not afraid of the dark, are you, newbie?
not if you're close.
Oh, shit!
what the hell is that? - Nothing, Sarge.
don't worry about it. It's just a scratch. It's all right.
it's a bite. You've been bitten.
no it's not. I'm all right. - He's been bitten.
we'll have to put that arm in a tourniquet, soldier.
you have to do more than that. - Medic.
nakagawa's been injured. Need to put his arm in a tourniquet, stat.
I'm on it, sir. - Alex: Jesus, Dalton.
you can't put a Band-Aid on an infection.
he's a dead man walking. He just doesn't know it yet.
hey hey hey. - What do you think you're doing, kiddo?
what do you think she's doing?
it's the right thing to do.
we can take care of our own. Grab him.
Sarge? Sarge, what are you doing?
no, Sarge, no! No, Sarge, no!
what the hell are you doing?
stand down, soldier! - No!
No!
sorry, no choice, soldier.
I told you. We take care of our own.
no no no no. - Sorry, doc.
Dalton to base. We lost Nakagawa and Braxton in a firefight with the hyper-sapiens, over.
hill: Copy that. HIII out.
hill, I need you and Hecht down here to police these bodies, stat.
let's go, ladies. Campus is right over the hill. Let's go.
get 'em all? Maybe we got 'em all.
not fucking likely.
all right, listen up. I want a full sweep of the perimeter.
there could be survivors.
all right, you guys, stay out of the shadows, all right?
keep in plain sight. We're gonna be fine.
Bart, you take Henson and Rodriguez to the dormitories.
gotcha. - O'Connor, Griffin, on point with me.
Ellis and Nightingale, do whatever the hell you want. Just don't get yourselves killed.
it'll mean lots of paperwork, and I hate fucking paperwork.
all right, come on, let's go, guys.
what is it?
looks like a fraternity ring.
might be valuable. - You're joking, right?
does it look like I'm joking?
hello.
well, I'm sorry, darling.
John can't come to the phone right now.
he's dead.
can you hear me now?
come on, let's go.
what the hell's that smell?
Bart: They don't all use us for bite, you know?
sometimes they use us for dinner.
I can see that.
all protein and no carbs.
you don't have the stomach for this, Rodriguez?
must be something I ate.
you mean more Iike something they ate.
come on now, take it like a man.
leave her alone, Bart.
I can take care of myself, Lieutenant.
whatever you say, Private.
you girls ready?
empty.
I think we took 'em all out.
we did it, man. We did it.
O'Connor, kill that chatter. Let's fan out.
all the buildings are connected with subterranean tunnels.
this entire university is honeycombed with 'em.
we don't need to lock this place down.
we just need to find your hypersapien and get the hell out of Dodge.
Alex: Well, this certainly explains how the hyper-saplens have been getting around.
they've been following the same patterns, habits that they had while they were still alive.
except with a much bigger appetite.
clear!
clear! Man, I love books.
Anton Chekhov, Fyodor Dostoyevsky,
Judy Blume. You know what I was reading?
Insane's the New Sexy.
give it a rest, man. - Hey, did you name your weapon?
you should 'cause it's your best friend out here.
my weapon's name is Sophie, Sophie Steen.
O'Connor, can it. - My sidearm's name is Tough Love.
enough, O'Connor. I got it.
Ho-ho-holy shit.
we got a survivor.
we don't know that. Could be one of them.
Hey, zombies don't read.
and they ain't hooked on phonics. So give it a rest.
Hey, kid.
he's got headphones on. - Hey, kid, can you hear me?
come on, kid, you're pissing me off.
careful.
O'Connor, this ain't my first rodeo.
and zombies don't read. Unbelievable.
come on, kid.
fucking zombie geek.
Shh!
son of a...
sorry about the noise.
let's move out. Form on me.
come on! Let's go before them bombs start dropping.
voices, survivors.
Hello, can you hear me in there?
Hey, you crummy teens, open the fucking door!
we're coming in. Stay down.
man on radio: It sounds to me that you were a Iittle underwhelming - In the sack... - Henson: Shit.
God, I can't believe this is happening.
Oh, don't go all girlie on me now.
Jesus Christ, it's like you two haven't seen a dead body before.
what the hell are you doing, Bart?
well, it seems that our unfortunate friend here was named Guy Woodhouse.
I guess he won't have to worry about finals anymore.
Adios, Senor Woodhouse. - Wow.
look here.
I don't want this.
I'm not giving it to you.
I just want you to take a picture.
picture of what?
of me...
and my new girlfriend.
okay? Go ahead.
we're ready. - Ready for what?
Oh, hey.
take the picture. - No fucking way.
Oh, fine!
I'll do It. - Don't you dare.
you know, I bet she was a looker when she was alive.
right? I mean, she's not too bad now, either.
I'd stick my dick in her, but I'm afraid of what would happen.
you're fucking disgusting.
you don't look fat, okay?
we really make a nice couple.
don't you think?
clear.
O'Connor.
O'Connor.
second generation.
close but no cigar.
doesn't mean anything. - We'll see.
I know it's not very scientific, but I follow my nose.
and my nose tells me we're getting close.
you sure you could develop a serum from this.
not me.
I'm just a grunt like you, but AMS has some pretty brilliant minds working for 'em, like Nightingale here.
they believe if they can get the DNA from a first generation zombie, generation zero, they can create an antibody.
that way we can stop playing catch-up and actually end this plague, - once and for all. - It's no different from whooping cough or smallpox.
really, it's just a matter of inoculating people against it.
if we're lucky, the zombie plague will end up as a footnote in the history books.
no worse than AIDS or bubonic plague.
Yeah, if it's all the same to you, Nightingale,
I'd rather you not refer to Tom as a footnote.
he lost his brother on a mission last week.
Yeah, well, we all lose people.
Yeah, but you're people don't usually get back up and take a bite out of you after they die.
careful.
you can infect yourself.
you sure as hell wouldn't want that, would you?
no, we wouldn't.
although if I did have to eat anyone,
I'd definitely pick you, kiddo.
don't worry.
if you die, I'll be sure to shoot you in the head before you get to.
that's too bad. A tight ass like you, probably enjoy being eaten by me.
say cheese.
don't you think we should continue looking for survivors, sir?
Absolutely.
but first, Lieutenant Henson, don't you want your Kodak moment with them?
Henson: That's all right. I think I'll take a pass.
well, it's your call, but I gotta tell ya.
I think you'd make a mint with these things on eBay.
I'm wondering about something. - What is it?
if these two were locked up in here, and there's no sign of forced entry, - how'd she get infected? - That's a good question.
and my answer to that is, who gives a fuck?
but if she didn't have contact with another person my worry is could the infection have gone airborne?
AMS said there's no sign of the infection being spread airborne.
AMS has their heads up their asses, okay?
that's why we do their dirty work for them.
I mean, if they knew what they were doing, they would have invented a vaccine by now and they would have had a full containment unit on this thing.
I'm just saying... - Ow!
what is it? - Bart: It's a...
it's nothing. It's just a...
mosquito bite, I think. - No way.
Oh, shit.
Sarge, I think I heard something.
keep it moving, soldier.
Sarge, somebody's up there.
stow that shit and keep moving.
Sarge, somebody's up there!
shit.
Hey, hey, wait up!
Hey, wait.
hello.
hello.
I know you're in here. You don't have to be afraid.
I'm coming to get you out. It's gonna be all right, okay?
I'm gonna get you right out of here.
it's gonna be okay. Gonna get you home.
you'll be all right. It's gonna be all over.
fuck.
Oh God.
what are we gonna do? We can't just leave him here.
can't take him with us. - You gotta take me back to base camp.
he could turn at any time.
maybe they found the zero sample, you know?
maybe they can... - What? Do what, cure you?
you know that's not gonna happen. - Maybe it can't be transmitted by mosquitoes.
maybe it was something else.
maybe they were already infected before they came into the room.
can't take that chance, Bart.
here. - What's this for?
you know what it's for.
use it.
soon as you start to feel the change coming.
what, are you insane?
I'm not gonna fucking kill myself. - Then I'll do it for you.
put the gun down!
you gotta take me with you.
you can't leave me here.
listen, Bart, you're endangering our entire mission.
we're wasting time.
I'll give you each a half a million dollars if you take me with you.
that's $500, 000 apiece.
huh?
what do you say, Rodriguez?
pretty young thing like you.
you don't want to live your whole life on the crap that Uncle Sam doles out to grunts like us, do you?
500, 000 bucks can buy a lot of shit.
you could be living it up Robin Leach style.
where you gonna get that kind of money?
pharmaceutical company.
if we get that zero matter to them before AMS, they're gonna pay us millions.
I mean, can you imagine what the patent on this drug is gonna be worth?
how much Goldman is gonna be willing to pay?
Dalton is in it with me.
you too can be in it with us, too.
there's gonna be enough to go around for everybody.
private, what the hell are you doing?
you can't be serious. - Hell yeah.
have you looked at your paycheck lately?
sounds like a good deal to me.
never underestimate the power of human greed, - Lieutenant Henson.
you didn't think I'd sell out our country for this piece of shit, - did you? - I should have known better.
what are we gonna do with him, madam?
we are gonna let him rot here with the rest of 'em.
Where's Griffin? - He was right behind us.
was, not anymore.
man, I told him to keep up.
gotta mo... shit.
Jesus.
look at this.
they must have lured the zombies into the cage, - got bitten in the process. - Shot themselves before they turned.
smart.
they can smell us.
this cage isn't gonna hold 'em forever.
we should get the hell out of here.
remember, I give the orders. - Go ahead.
order away.
this cage ain't gonna hold 'em forever.
let's move out of here. Let's get moving, come on.
ugly son of a bitch.
nightingale, get down!
I'm okay. I'm okay.
no, you're not. You're infected. - I'm okay. I'm o... okay.
he's turning. - No, I'm not turning.
I'm... I'm fine. - Ellis: Dalton, stay back.
O'Connor!
stay back, Sarge! - Stand down.
I don't wanna do this.
name's Autumn Colville. Mother reported her missing yesterday.
the blood. And that corpse.
what corpse?
Scanlon just called. They found the remains of Autumn Colville.
there were several more duffel bags down there.
when they opened them up, they found the butchered body parts of two more girls.
looks like we got ourselves a serial killer.
I got a call from Ashley's father today.
he's convinced that his daughter is sharing her antianxiety medication with you.
there's this girl, and she won't leave me alone and she won't let me study or concentrate...
wait a second. Hold on. What girl?
Stacey Anne-- is she dead?
we decided that if the doctor thinks that this medicine will improve the quality of your life,
I will try to get that appointment as soon as possible.
Allison Dubois? I'm Caitlyn Lynch.
I'm with the Lydecker Corporation.
you're offering me a job?
what exactly does it mean when they say "high six figures"?
means you need to call her tomorrow.
you need to find out what this is all about.
so you think I should take it?
how do you not take it?
these are employee dossiers.
I'd like you to spend some time with them.
see if there's anyone among this group that gives you pause.
well, he's really the only person who jumped out at me.
and this is the only employee that you're worried about?
he's Justin Lydecker. Mr. Lydecker's son.
your father is interested in my impressions of things, people, which is why I think he wanted me to sit down with you.
Yeah. That's what I figured.
he wants you to tell him if his only son is permanently screwed up or if I can be...
salvaged.
Lee, it's me. I just had another dream.
I think it happened again, another murder.
the dreams you've been having about the murders, did you mention your dreams to your colleague?
dreams that we're talking about have nothing to do with Lydecker.
your dreams, your impressions, they belong to Lydecker now.
they are actually the intellectual property of our company.
if you ever breach your contract again,
I will litigate you with a vigor unlike anything you have ever experienced in your life.
he knows.
hold on a second, wait. I'm not following. Who-who is this "he"?
what is it you're saying that he knows?
and while we're at it, where are you going?
I think I need to get dressed. I need to go tell somebody.
but, Allison...
it's not even 6: 00 in the morning. Tell me.
that maniac who's killing all those women, gouging their eyes out, it's Justin Lydecker.
Douglas Lydecker's son, my boss's son, his only son, his only child.
and I think he knew, or at least he suspected.
I think that's why he hired me.
to do what? To get confirmation?
that, and the special added bonus that if I ever dreamt the awful truth,
I couldn't do anything with those dreams because...
he owns them. Your dreams are his. That's-that's very smart.
guess that's how you get to be Douglas Lydecker.
so what are you gonna do?
I have to tell the district attorney.
maybe if I hurry up, I can get there before Devalos arrives.
nobody will see me. No one will ever know.
I had a very interesting dream about you last night.
you were having a conversation with your husband about things you saw in your sleep.
and then you made a decision toDI cUMome here and share what you saw with your old boss.
well, then you know everything there is to know.
why don't you come in with me, and we can talk to the district attorney together.
Allison, I'm not going in there.
and you're not going in there. It's simply not going to happen.
I beg to differ.
Allison, if you go in that building and have the conversation you intend to, you'll be forcing Mr. Lydecker to take legal action.
I'm trying to help you.
this is difficult for me, too.
well, let me make it easier. Here, I quit.
it doesn't work that way.
go back and read your contract.
quitting doesn't release you from the terms of our agreement. Far from it.
if you breach your contract in any way at any time, Lydecker can and will sue you.
they will go after all of your assets.
and when those are depleted, they'll go after any collective assets you may have with your husband.
I'm talking about your home, Allison.
I'm talking about your husband's stake in his venture with Cavanaugh Industries.
I'm talking about any college fund you may have started for your girls.
Allison, Lydecker has an army of lawyers.
and I promise you, there is nothing you own that they won't find and take away.
women are dying horrible deaths.
I'm aware of that.
Mr. Lydecker is aware of that.
we all want it to stop. It's just, it cannot stop this way.
Allison, before you play fast and loose with your family's future, please, Mr. Lydecker wants to see you.
he wants to discuss this with you.
there's nothing to discuss.
just hear him out.
Douglas is devastated about this.
I promise you, he is not an evil man.
and he has a plan on how to handle this.
are you trying to tell me something?
the thing is, if it's something important, I want to hear you.
I want to help. But if it isn't...
I'm going to the doctor's tomorrow, and I'm gonna try and get him to give me pills.
and then I won't be able to hear you. It will be too late. So...
if you have something to tell me...
Ariel, wake up. Young lady, wake up.
that's better. We don't show these videos for you to sleep through.
that girl, Karina Tyler, the first victim, she worked here, you know.
a summer intern. Justin...
Oh, he couldn't stop looking at her.
and when she came to talk to me about his...
disturbing behavior...
I did what I'd always done. I - I paid her to go away, quickly, quietly.
it worked with the girls he frightened in high school, the girls he...
forced himself on in college. It seemed to work with her.
but then... months later...
when I read that she had gone missing, I couldn't...
I couldn't help but wonder.
but we weren't sure.
that's when I told Mr. Lydecker about you.
I'd been reading about you, hearing about you.
I told Mr. Lydecker that if Karina wasn't just missing, if she were dead, that she might try to reach out through you.
well, you're right.
there's something terribly wrong with your son.
and it's up to us to stop him.
we have to go to the district attorney, - tell him what we know. - No, no. No.
it's been handled. It's being handled.
no, I'm sorry, Mr. Lydecker, it's not being handled.
it can't be handled.
your son lives to kill, and he will kill again.
and now that there's no Detective AuerbacMEhDI cleaning up after him, he will be caught.
you're aware of that, right?
he was paying a detective to cover his tracks.
detective Auerbach...
used to work for me.
he provided security for company parties, for events.
and after Justin started getting into scuffles in nightclubs,
I asked him to moonlight as Justin's bodyguard, keep him out of trouble.
are you a fan of irony, Mrs. Dubois?
Mr. Lydecker, I appreciate your pain.
but there's really only one thing to do.
Justin has to surrender to the district attorney.
I know the district attorney.
I will go down there with your son.
I will make sure that he is treated fairly.
well, that is a very generous offer.
and it's one that I would give serious consideration to if my son were still in this country.
what are you talking about?
Justin is in a safe place.
he's in the care of a physician that I trust.
he's begun a course of therapy to treat Justin's condition.
therapy? There is no therapy.
are you aware of chemical castration?
it's proven very effective in the treatment of child molesters, serial rapists.
his doctor is highly optimistic.
what about his victims?
there are four dead women he has to account for.
the families of those women deserve justice.
Yes. And they'll get it.
a kind of justice, anyway.
I've begun making anonymous donations to their families, and they'll be extremely well compensated.
Mrs. Dubois, believe me when I tell you this.
the souls of these women will always weigh heavily on me.
please don't do anything foolish.
like your dreams, keep this conversation to yourself.
just don't give me a reason to behave in ways that will make both of us very unhappy.
well?
I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.
but this contract looks pretty ironclad to me.
I think that the only thing to do is to hire an attorney.
even then I'm not holding out a lot of hope.
I don't understand. How can they control who I talk to?
I mean, as long as it's not a competitor...
no, Allison...
well, the way that I read that thing, I'm not even supposed to be having this conversation with you.
okay, be that as it may, if Junior really is under a doctor's care in some foreign country, then the immediate danger is gone.
there's really not all that much to talk to Devalos about.
and as for getting you out of there, getting you out of your contract,
I mean, I think that the only thing to do is to start looking for an attorney in the morning.
I'm psychic.
why didn't I see this coming?
how could I have been so stupid? - Don't do that.
you took the job for all the right reasons.
and don't forget, you had a lot of help. I encouraged you.
I pushed you to take it.
come on. Let's just get some rest.
for one thing, we got Ariel's doctors appointment in the morning.
for another, maybe it will give us some clarity.
maybe things will look a lot better in the morning.
I'm not nearly as convinced of that as you are.
how you feeling?
like somebody drugged me and flew me to a foreign country and locked me in my room without TV.
well, I am trying to save your life.
you're trying to save your business.
daddy, you're trying to save your reputation.
it's not good for the stock prices if people read that the CEO's son likes to julienne pretty young girls and take their eyes as souvenirs.
probably would have made for a contentious stockholders' meeting as well.
Justin, do you not understand?
they are hours away from arresting you.
you have any idea what prison would be like for someone like you?
okay. All right. You just...
you just keep clinging to your pose and I'll keep willing you into accepting the second chance that I am giving you, whether you want it or not.
you pathetic slug. - You're such an ass.
please. Please. I can't breathe. I can't...
what? He wants to live?
how human of him.
you understand about these treatments?
now. In front of me.
the nurse says we're next.
do you hear me? - What?
we're next.
you all right? - Yeah. I'm fine.
just something with my new job.
something I have to tell my-my boss.
or my boss's boss.
I tried to call, but couldn't get a hold of anyone this morning.
I'm okay here if you want to step outside and use your cell.
no. No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
you want to just go?
what do you mean? Leave?
honey, what are you talking about?
you waited a long time for this appointment.
what about your test and your studying?
Ariel, it's going to be all right.
this doctor knows me.
I think he's going to understand.
Diane? Are you out there?
why is someone knocking on my door?
whoever you are, go away.
this is my serenity time.
I've been trying to get to you all day.
sorry. I've been in meetings. On conference calls.
Mr. Lydecker's out of the country, so...
Justin isn't taking his medication.
and you know this because...
because I dreamt it last night.
he's pretending. He really doesn't want to get better.
that's not possible. His father is with him.
he's supervising the treatment himself.
he's putting on an act.
as soon as Mr. Lydecker leaves the room, Justin throws his medication in the toilet.
can you get me Mr. Lydecker, please?
you know where he is, right?
tell him it's urgent.
Allison? - Yeah, I'm afraid so.
how do you do that?
how do you know the exact moment when everything from spaghetti night is all cleaned up and it's safe to come home, huh?
very not funny. Bridgette and Marie asleep?
Yes. Just barely. You ever get to Lydecker?
no. We just kept calling and calling.
finally, Caitlyn told me just to come home.
that she'd keep trying till she got him.
I just wish I knew where they were stashing Justin.
I swear to God, I would pick up the phone and tell Devalos everything I know.
see if maybe he could make some kind of arrangement with the authorities and bring him back here.
Hey, did you happen to pick up that medication for Ariel?
Yes, indeed. All $97 worth of it.
now the challenge is going to be getting her to take it.
what are you talking about?
so, what's changed?
a week ago, all you could think about was getting those pills.
I know.
you and Dad must think I'm crazy.
there's this substitute teacher at my school, Miss Snowden.
and when I see her sometimes, it's like someone's hurt her.
she's all bloody and cut up and...
she's not really.
not yet, but it's like she's going to be.
so, is there's something we should do? Someone I should talk to?
I'm afraid that if I take these pills,
Stacey Anne won't be able to show me what I need to know.
you know that the PSATs are the day after tomorrow?
I know.
and I know that these pills will make everything I'm seeing go away.
and I'll be able to concentrate.
but if something happens to Miss Snowden...
something that I could have prevented...
so, you think you could hang onto these for a while for me?
sure, honey.
what kind of a fool do you take me for?
it's time you take your medicine.
all right, that's right, that's all right.
you just go ahead, you scream all you want!
you just scream all you want. I sent the guards away.
it's just you and me.
I'm going nowhere until these pills are in your gullet!
okay, come on.
open up! Swallow! Swallow, swallow, here we go.
open up, open, open.
swallow! Swallow. Swallow. Swallow, swallow!
isn't this fantastic?
go ahead. Pick an artery, Pop.
which one you want me to start with?
how about the carotid?
that's always a winner for me.
Hello? - Allison? It's Caitlyn.
Caitlyn, I've been trying to reach you all night.
I know. I've been on a plane. I just landed. I got your messages.
Allison, do you have a passport?
what? Yeah. W - Wait a second.
there's something I need to tell you.
I had another dream about Justin and his father.
please, Allison. I think I already know. I just...
I'm sending a car to your house.
it'll bring you to the Phoenix airport.
the Lydecker hangar. There will be a plane waiting.
it'll bring you here to me.
so we can talk.
W - Where am I going?
I'd really rather not say.
wait, Caitlyn, no. I - I'm a mother.
I - I have three children, a husband.
I'm not getting on a plane without them all knowing where I'm going.
mexico City.
the plane will land in Mexico City.
a car will be waiting to bring you to me.
what's happened here is horrible.
I really need you.
Allison, thank you for coming.
I wanted to fill you in on what's happened here.
but I already know what happened here.
no, I don't think that you do.
apparently, a radical terrorist faction, was able to infiltrate Mr. Lydecker's security force here at his vacation compound.
they slaughtered him, Allison.
Douglas Lydecker was butchered by zealous anti-capitalists determined to create chaos in the Western World and its financial markets.
Really? And did they carve his eyes out?
why are you protecting him? Why are you protecting this monster?
it's not about him.
it's about Lydecker Industries and the tens of thousands of people who work there and the hundreds of thousands of people who own stock.
Allison, public appetites, public perceptions-- those are the things that I know a lot about.
you tell the world that the son killed the father and you've sullied the Lydecker name forever.
that is the kind of scanda l that will destroy the company.
kill sales, crater the stock price.
but you tell the world that this was the work of terrorists?
well, you can't buy the public sympathy and goodwill that will engender.
people will rally around the company.
they'll feel that it's their duty to do so.
and what about Justin? He's still out there. What's to say he won't kill again?
I am taking care of it.
I'm going to find Justin and I will deal with him in a way that doesn't hurt the company or either of us.
us? What do you mean, us?
us. You and me.
all of our fates are tied to Justin at this point.
we have all helped to cover his crimes.
if Justin is ever implicated in this murder,
I have no doubt that he will happily detail everything we've done to help him elude the authorities.
so, I suggest you wipe that disapproving look off your face and get on board.
we're in this together, Allison.
and the sooner you realize that, the better.
I love you.
young lady. First row? Eyes front.
I think that you really need to go now, Garrett.
no.
please.
I love you.
I don't understand.
doesn't that mean anything to you?
Garrett, don't do this.
I am as low as I can possibly be.
not that it matters to you but this...
this girl that I was tutoring privately for the PSATs, she died in a car accident a couple weeks ago.
drowned.
today was the memorial and...
no, I just... I need to be by myself.
I need to not be worrying about you.
I need you to go.
please don't make me call somebody.
I'm sorry about the girl.
but I'm staying here. I'm sleeping here.
put it down.
put it down. - Go.
don't forget to get a good night's sleep, folks.
tomorrow's the big day.
miss Snowden? - Yes?
do you know somebody named Garrett?
I- I'm sorry. Wh-What is your name?
young lady, I'm talking to you.
you seem to know some things about me and I'd like to know how and I'd like to know your name.
sir?
Allison. What are you doing here?
Douglas Lydecker's son?
I know I should've told you sooner.
I debated with myself all the way home on the plane and then I landed,
I called Joe, he told me to drive right over here from the airport.
I'm so sorry.
you did what you had to do to protect your family.
I understand that.
you were being threatened by Douglas Lydecker. That's a formidable threat.
he might still be alive today if I just ignored him and came right to you.
so, what happens now?
I really don't know.
if the Lydecker boy is truly at large in a foreign country, the first step would be to try to extradite him.
and that's almost impossible to do without concrete physical evidence.
you can't do anything?
not at the moment.
I may talk to Justice, ask some friends of mine there to take a second and third look at this terrorist thing with an especially jaundiced eye, but...
what?
I've been quaking in anticipation of this conversation.
Douglas Lydecker convinced me that the second that
I even uttered his son's name to you, the earth was just gonna open up and swallow me and my family whole.
but...
nothing is different now that we had this conversation. Nothing.
nothing's gonna happen.
except I know that Justin Lydecker is gonna kill again.
all of us here at the Lydecker Corporation are obviously still reeling with the news of the death of our founder and CEO, Douglas Lydecker.
but I want to reassure all of our investors, our customers and our employees around the globe that our business operations will continue without interruption.
I believe to do anything less would be to suggest that the savagery that ended this great industrial titan's life was somehow effective and that our founder's belief in the power of ideas to create worthwhile products and meaningful employment was somehow misplaced.
of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Thank you.
and that was the scene at a hastily called press conference in Mexico today where Caitlyn...
well, I'm glad somebody's happy about all this.
Devalos actually said there was nothing he could do?
well, he needs evidence. He needs Justin to come back to America.
the first he doesn't have and the second...
is never gonna happen.
so, he's right, there's nothing to do.
except of course, for me to find a lawyer to get me out of this Lydecker contract.
but, hey...
that's why God invented tomorrow.
can I talk to you for a second?
I didn't know what to do.
but I just didn't believe that he would hurt her.
not kill her, anyways.
and I just... I left.
I ran away.
I mean, she doesn't know my name or anything and she's just a substitute, but I feel like an idiot.
I don't know how I'm gonna go in that classroom tomorrow and take that test with her standing there.
you think maybe that was the point?
you think maybe Stacey Anne just wanted to play a big joke on me?
try and get me to embarrass myself with the teacher who was gonna proctor the test?
I have no idea, honey, but you are gonna walk in that classroom.
you are gonna take that test.
obviously, I'll just be mortified.
I'll just slink in with my head down and sit in the back and hope that somehow she doesn't notice me, doesn't say anything.
what are you saying? That you might want to take one of those pills?
no, I don't think so.
I think the worst is over. I think Stacey Anne is done with me.
I think that the hardest part's gonna be walking through the door.
go ahead. Pick an artery, Pop.
which one do you want me to start with?
how about the carotid, huh? That's always a winner for me.
Diane, are you out there?
why is someone knocking on my door?
she knew. - What?
Caitlyn knew Justin was gonna kill his father.
she knew it before I did, but she didn't do anything to stop it.
you knew.
what?
No,"It's good to have you back"?
No,"How was your flight?" Just,"You knew.
so, what did I know, Allison?
what is it that you think that I knew?
that Justin was gonna kill his father.
when I came here that day to tell you he wasn't taking his medication, you already knew.
you had dreamt it. You-you... you just let it happen.
that is quite an accusation.
so what? Now-now you're just running the place?
well, temporarily.
ultimately, that will be up to the board.
but presuming I do a good job...
Allison, this will be good for you, too.
I understand better than most what a valuable asset you can be.
I understand what a real value you are to a company like ours.
you let Mr. Lydecker die.
I saw it, Caitlyn. I am onto you, and I'm not gonna let you get away with it.
get away with what exactly?
I mean, even if you were accurate about any of this, you still haven't suggested that I actually did anything, have you?
I mean, all that might have happened was maybe I had a dream and didn't tell anyone.
that's what you're saying, right?
that's not a crime.
now I need to freshen up.
have a little contemplation time.
Oh, I was thinking in maybe about an hour, we'll have a little meeting, you, me, some of the division leaders.
I have some big plans I'm gonna lay out.
do you even know where he is? Justin?
he is dangerous!
you told me you were gonna do something about him.
no. Actually, I have no idea.
that's part of what I was counting on you for.
Allison, you seem to have a special dream connection with him.
Caitlyn, you're 11: 00 is here.
Allison, I need you to go. I need to get on with my day.
Oh, Allison, remember, you're still under contract here.
and I expect you to honor the same level of confidentiality that existed before Mr. Lydecker passed on...
or face the same consequences.
please take a moment to complete the personal information in section A.
take one test booklet and pass the rest to the person behind you.
and your 25 minutes begins now.
eyes front, no talking.
Julie, come on! Open the door!
I know you're in there.
it's Wednesday, 10: 30. It's a school night.
don't pretend you can't hear me.
I still got my key. I'm coming in, okay?
it's Garrett.
I'm coming in, okay?
Hey, you okay?
it's okay, honey. Look...
they said that you could take that test again in a couple months.
look, I know you're disappointed.
I know you put a lot of pressure on yourself.
and maybe next time we should rethink this pill thing.
I mean, if...
if that's what makes it easier for you to deal with these situations...
someone's gonna take her eyes.
what?
miss Snowden...on a Wednesday, around 10: 30, someone's gonna come into her house and cut her up and take her eyes.
Diane, can you make my 11: 00 a lunch meeting?
I want to go down to R&D in the morning.
Yes, of course. - Thank you.
Justin Lydecker, son of recently deceased billionaire Douglas Lydecker, was arrested earlier this evening in connection with a grisly string of murders in the Phoenix area.
we're told the case broke when Justin Lydecker was caught breaking into and entering an apartment of a local teacher.
the authorities have confirmed that Lydecker had numerous surgical knives in his possession at the time of the arrest.
the police are also said to be investigating a theory that the young man may actually have been responsible for his father's death - in Mexico City earlier this week, - Oh, my God.
a murder that was initially... - Ms. Lynch?
not now.
I'm sorry, but Allison Dubois is here.
she has the district attorney with her.
come in. Have a seat.
thank you, but that's okay. We won't be staying that long.
I see that you already know about the arrest of Justin Lydecker.
Yes, I'm-I'm shocked.
I knew he was troubled, but I had no idea...
stop, Caitlyn. Just stop. He knows everything.
Justin-- at the request of his counsel
became quite talkative when I took the death penalty off the table.
he shared some very interesting information about you.
apparently, you knew all about his intentions towards his father.
said he discussed it with you at length.
that you had tipped him off in advance that his father planned to transport him to Mexico and that you even suggested that that might be the perfect place for him to kill his father.
that you knew you could pay off the right officials to make it look like an act of terror.
let me make sure I understand.
you're accusing me of some sort of crime based on the word of an admitted serial killer?
well, if that's all you have, I'm quite confident that my attorney's will make short work of these accusations.
actually, our case doesn't hinge on Justin's word as much as on the combined contents of his voice mail inbox here at Lydecker, his personal cell phone text-message records and the testimony of some of the officials that you paid off in Mexico.
so do you want to take a moment to make that phone call to your attorneys now or would you prefer to wait till we get downtown?
I'd prefer to make that call now, if you don't mind.
not a problem. Mrs. Dubois and I will wait outside.
I'm sure you'll understand that after I get off the phone with my attorneys,
I'll be calling Human Resources and instructing them to terminate your contract, retrieve you car, collect any keys, computer data, documents, any items of clothing that might have been purchased with corporate funds.
I'll also be sending someone to your house to retrieve any property that might have been purchased with corporate dollars.
and I'm grateful.
the authorities in Russia are bracing themselves today, for mass protests against the trial, of former billionaire Yuri Komarov.
the case against Mr. Komarov has caused widespread division amongst the Russian public, some of whom view his incarceration as a political maneuver, orchestrated by this man,
defense Minister Candidate Viktor Chagarin.
what do you want Viktor?
why are you doing this?
what do you want to accomplish tomorrow?
I'm prepared to pay for my sins.
you should prepare yourself too.
Yuri, let's be civil about this. We were friends once...are could be again.
just give me the file...
and I'll hand your life back to you.
forget this stupid trial.
I don't want my life back.
you think I'm going to let you talk tomorrow?
no one is going to hear you!
I own everybody in that courtroom.
you don't own me.
Mike.
Chagarin's making a move on Komarov.
shit. I'll see if we got local.
we are ready to get started.
make the call.
you won't disappoint me?
have I ever disappointed you?
Anton.
Alik, it's Viktor.
Yuri Komarov says hello...
it's time to grab him.
Yuri Komarov?
and goodbye.
McClane.
Hey, Murph, how you doing?
nice grouping, Grandpa.
Yeah, not bad.
is that it?
Yep. We found him.
it's not good, John.
hospital or morgue?
worse.
when was the last time you spoke to this kid?
it's been a while.
maybe a few years, even.
last time I saw him, it was pretty ugly.
well, there's a few different versions in there, but my people are pretty sure he's being held at a Moscow prison, awaiting sentencing.
what's he charged with?
it's a nasty sheet.
he'll be lucky to get life.
he can never get out of his own way.
he had a lot of problems.
he's still my kid.
I know.
but it's Russia. They do things differently over there.
me, too.
good luck, Poppy.
Thanks, kid.
God damn you! God damn it!
welcome to John F. Kennedy International Airport.
Thanks, kid.
McClane, good luck.
see you soon.
I was told you had something to offer me?
you're looking for evidence against Yuri Komarov?
perhaps.
put me in the courtroom with him...
and I'll testify that Komarov hired me to murder Anton.
did he?
I'll testify under oath.
that's good enough, isn't it?
Draganskiy courthouse?
you speak Russian?
how did I do?
well, you asked for a large bag of hair, on the way to Taganskaya courthouse.
but I got it. I got it.
good.
traffic sucks here, too, huh?
sex?
you want sex? Sexy clubs?
no. No sex.
it sucks, this traffic.
what is it? An accident?
no.
garden Ring. Is bad.
always traffic, always traffic.
you're American?
Yeah, American. New York.
the Big Apple.
I want to wake up in that city that never sleeps,
that's it.
Frank Sinatra. Chairman of the Board.
that's right.
the Chairman. Yeah.
you sing good.
these little town blues are melting away.
Yes, I sing.
I sing all the time.
Yeah.
king of the hill Top of the world.
huh?
heap. "Top of the heap."
all right, all right. Taganskaya courthouse, right there.
two blocks.
you better walk, traffic is bad. Really bad.
what do I owe you?
Hey, no money.
no money, you let me sing. You let me sing.
you listen to my singing. No money.
welcome to Moscow.
that little town blues are melting away.
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it, in old New York.

Oh, fuck!
Jack! I'm not done talking to you!
who is this?
come on, go!
concentrate, please.
that's right, come on through, yeah!
see if you can hit this guy!
Jesus!
I'm tired of this guy.

Jesus!
you missed! Interesting choice, man.
Hey, hey!
Hey!
Whoa!
Hey! Whoa!
come on!
you gotta be fucking kidding me!
what?
do you think I understand a word you're saying?
Jesus Christ.
it's okay, I'm fine, thanks.
Oh, man, you're driving like my grandma!
when I say drive, I mean fly!
Oh, yeah!
get out of the way!
Oh, God.
Jesus!
Oh, for the love of...
sorry, ma'am!
sorry!
did you see this guy?
Oh, man!
knock knock.
guess who!
I've had enough of this shit.
Oh, man, hey!
is that it? Is that your best shot?
damn you, John.
damn you!
Hey! Up here!
shoot up here!
John! Get in!
get in before I change my mind. Jesus!
take your time.
Jack, what the fuck was that, huh?
shut up. Shut up, John.
I swear to God, I will put a bullet in you this time.
who do you think you're talking to?
the last person I want to see.
well, maybe you missed the whole part back there where I saved you and Papa Geppetto here from a whole bunch of Russian bad guys.
you saved? You saved?
that's right, saved.
shut up. - Shut up.
you're a world class screw-up, you know that, John?
I'm a screw-up? I'm a screw-up?
I'm still your father.
Yeah, nothing I can do about that.
what a joke.
just shut up. Try not to touch anything, all right?
you've done enough goddamn damage.
the appointment is next week...
we will begin immediately.
excuse me, sir. Komarov has escaped.
I'll call you back. There is a problem with Komarov.
what happened?
some sort of attack on the courthouse.
who took him?
they don't know yet.
what do you mean you don't know?
eh...
well it's confusing...
eyewitnesses say they saw Komarov with an American.
what American?
John McClane.
let's go.
after you.
Yeah, I got him. Okay, I'm on it.
look, Mike, we had an unexpected delay. I'm sorry.
I understand.
this is the last guy on earth I expected to see.
listen to me, Yuri, you have half of Moscow looking for you.
I need you to get dressed. - Why am I here?
please put on these clothes. Trust me.
this is the key to your cuffs. Take these.
Oh, my Jesus.
are you okay? - What?
do you have the file on Chagarin?
this is what you been doing, Jack?
spy shit?
this is it?
you're a spy? Oh, my God.
the 007 of Plainfield, New Jersey.
very nice.
McClane, shut up.
take it easy, oddjob.
I'm on vacation.
your mom will be pleased.
we thought you were doing drugs or something.
Mr. Komarov.
or selling drugs, but that was me, really.
do you have the file on Chagarin?
Yes, or no?
it's very simple, Yuri.
you give me the file, and I get you out of Russia.
and you're a free man. What do you say?
it's not about me. I don't care about my life.
well, that's the deal.
it's the only deal.
come on.
come on, Yuri. Help yourself.
what's it gonna be?
yes or no?
the clock is ticking, Yuri. Come on.
you will get me out of here?
only the three of you?
whoa, Nijinsky. I'm not in the gang.
I just got off the plane. I'm still jet-lagged.
I'm not involved in this. Huh, Jack?
only if I can take my daughter with me.
Chagarin's people will kill her.
fine. Make it quick.
Ah.
Where's the file?
it's in a vault in Prypiat, but the key is here in Moscow.
at Hotel Ukraina.
shit.
make your call. We're going to the Ukraina, let's go.
it's papa...
I'm fine, Sunshine...
we'll talk later.
listen.
I'll be waiting for you where your mother and I shared our first dance.
now.
Hurry! Hurry! You understand?
Mike, listen, I'm sorry about this morning, man.
it's fine.
okay, let's go.
contact!
down! Get down!
go! Get down! Go, go, go!
John, cover!
come on, buddy!
go! Go!
that's right, jerk-off!
all right, let's move, John!
I'm on fucking vacation!
come on, time to hustle. Watch your head.
McClane, move it.
8, 000 fucking miles for this?
get down, Yuri. Stay low!
head down.
come on. Go, go!
safe house, my ass.
he knows how old we are, no?
come on.
here, here, here.
sit down. You're all right.
let me look at you.
it's all right. You're fine.
what are you doing?
Jack.
calm down, Yuri, okay? You're gonna be just fine.
here, put this on, stay warm.
what was that, John? Five minutes? Five minutes?
you blew a three-year operation in five minutes!
you're welcome! What do you want me to do?
unbelievable.
I'm so fucking burned. I got no friends in this town anymore.
what about your people at Langley? Just give them a call.
give me your phone.
it's a two-year contract on that phone.
what are you carrying? Give me that.
all right. You got any cash on you?
some American money.
what are you talking about? We need to keep on moving.
we have to get this guy to a doctor. To medical attention, Jack.
the mission stands.
your mission is bleeding out over there.
the mission continues. We go to the hotel.
come on, let's move. Let's move.
this is nuts.
what, are you going to go out and kill somebody else now?
why all this trouble for just one guy?
he's a political prisoner.
not that you care, John, but it's a matter of national security, all right?
he's got the goods to stop Viktor Chagarin, and we need that to happen.
well, great, Jack.
let's drop him off at the Embassy, and we can go home.
are you kidding me? After what happened at the safe house?
look, it doesn't work like that, all right?
it's a huge diplomatic mess, and I'm a burnable asset.
so, I now need that file to un-fuck this mission.
any more questions?
Yeah, just one.
how come you never called and told me where you were?
like you'd give a shit.
shit.
well, we're not going in the front door.
all right, hold up, hold up.
okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right? We're almost done.
as soon as we get that key, we're gonna grab the file, get you and your daughter out of Russia, all right?
all right.
listen to me, you're doing good. All right?
I need you to hang here a second. Keep an eye on him, John.
Hey, hey.
what is it with all this "John" shit? Whatever happened to "Dad?"
good question.
in Russia, we have word for men like him.
Krutoi.
it means "tough" , "hard" .
in America, it means "juvenile delinquent."
is he your only child?
no. I got a daughter, too.
you?
I have only my Solnyschka.
when she was little, I was working all the time.
I believed work was all that mattered.
I screwed my kid's life up, too.
you work all the time around the clock most of the time, when you're a cop.
I just thought that working all the time was a good thing, you know?
I didn't help him at all.
it's never too late,
I hope.
okay, let's go.
all right, Yuri, which part of the building is the ballroom in?
main tower.
main tower. Which floor?
top floor.
what about security?
you remember any guards? Cameras? Anything like that?
I don't know.
well, I need you to remember.
I was in prison for five years, how should I know?
everything could have changed. - I know.
just think, all right? Picture it in your head.
the ballroom was closed in '89.
I think it's under construction now.
so that floor's unsecured.
I don't know! Listen! My daughter is in there.
I'm scared to death, let's go!
just calm down, Yuri.
I guess you have done that before.
smart.
I could have done it.
Irina?
Irina?
Irina?
Papa.
Irina. - Papa!
that's tender.
Really? I wouldn't know.
need a hug?
we're not really a hugging family.
that's right.
we just have to get one thing...
and then we're leaving Moscow for good.
OK?
OK.
who are they?
the young one works for CIA.
the old one is his father. Americans.
then thank God for them.
there's something no good about this.
just shut up, all right?
I'm telling you, Jack, this smells bad.
just stop, okay?
this might seem like a totally foreign concept, you know?
I know you love to just run in, making shit up.
but like any professional, I have a plan.
so let's just stick to it, okay?
just move your plan along.
all right, Yuri, come on. Let's grab the key, get out of here.
Yes.
just take a moment.
how you doing?
fine.
how did you get over here so quick?
well...
I took Garden Ring.
Oh, the Garden Ring. Supposed to always be bad, right?
Hey, John.
did you get stuck in traffic?
I have it! I have it.
welcome, Americans.
put your goddamn guns down, asshole!
Papa, what is going on?
give me your weapons.
come and get them.
Really?
really.
Papa.
Yuri.
do it.
I thought you were a problem child.
this a part of your plan, Mr. Professional?
what are you doing?
it's about money, papa...
millions of dollars.
you think life was easy for me while you were sitting in prison being a victim?
but.
I'm your father.
and I am your daughter.
we should kill the old man now.
we still need him.
but then you can kill.
thank you.
Hi.
I don't know if I'm saying this right.
Hi.
do you know what I hate about the Americans?
everything.
especially cowboys.
I could have been a dancer. I swear to God.
but nobody supported me.
you two have been such a pain in the ass!
come on, come on!
I prefer dancing, really.
but killing is much, much better than working in a grocery shop!
Jesus Christ!
nice one.
you guys. So arrogant.
it's not 1986, you know.
reagan is dead.
sorry. Oh, God.
what's funny there?
can't tell you.
it's not you. I love these outfits.
you guys are looking good.
that was enough, thank you.
let's dance.
come on! Come on!
Jack!
remember the last time we talked just before you went away?
Oh, no! Not at all!
you're not gonna open up to me right before we die!
no, that's not your thing, John.
what's my thing?
fucking killing bad guys, that's your thing!
you're not gonna die today!
go!
shit!
fuck.
we're finished, John.
I'm taking care of it now.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe this. This is unbelievable.
Jack. Hey!
Jesus!
come on!
let's get out of this building!
where are they?
come on.
Alik, that's it. We're done!
let's go!
break left!
copy, Commander.
do you have him?
Yes.
and the file?
does he have it?
I need that file, Alik.
he's taking us to it.
no more mistakes, Alik.
and when you have the file...
kill them both.
Yes, sir.
shit.
that was exciting.
Yeah. Loads of fun.
you wanna go again?
are you shot?
no.
no, I'm fine.
let me take a look at that.
it's fine.
Oh, fuck.
I can't believe she betrayed her father for Chagarin.
I don't understand that.
someday you will.
kids.
what's our next move?
I don't know.
you don't know? - I don't know, all right?
I mean, I'm out of moves. I don't know.
I don't know.
I screwed up.
I blew the mission.
well, then we're done, right?
Yeah, we're done.
we're done.
we should just go home.
we'll stop by a little pharmacy on our way out of Moscow, get you some merthiolate or mercury and fix up your little scratches, here.
get you home. Get a little toy set.
get yourself a nice warm glass of milk with a little Bosco in it.
get your CIA slippers.
all right.
what? - I get it.
what the hell are we gonna do?
what's in the file?
evidence on Chagarin.
evidence about what?
Chernobyl.
look, listen to me.
Komarov and Chagarin used to have this nasty little side-racket going on back in the day.
they siphoned weapons-grade uranium, got greedy, caused the meltdown.
then, you know, they fell out.
former partners, bad break-up.
scumbags.
so, Chagarin had Komarov thrown in jail.
you know, put him in a hole, forget about him.
doesn't have to worry anymore.
so what happened to rescuesque?
well, he grew a conscience.
Yeah, well, that figures.
listen, Chagarin is bad news. He's the real deal.
if we see this guy in control, we're gonna see the whole thing fall apart.
I'm talking terrorism,
WMDS, nukes.
someone has to stop him.
well, that's what we do.
we go out to Chiapep and we do our thing.
our thing?
Yeah.
we go out there and kill a lot of scumbags.
what? You got something better to do?
all right. Pull it.
you're not gonna cry, are you?
just pull it.
everybody needs a good cry once in a while, Jack.
don't be ashamed. - Pull it.
you remember that time when you and Ralphie Mauser were gonna have that house-painting job?
got your finger caught in the ladder, you cried for about five, six days.
John, just pull it!
all right.
on three. Here you go.
one, two...
good God.
Jesus.
when was the last time you had a tetanus shot?
you all right?
Yeah.
we need a car.
Atta boy.
back to work.
Hey, Watergate, how's that lock coming?
almost there.
here, try these.
come on.
Oh, stealing. That's nice. Real nice, John.
Yeah, I'm up for the Father of the Year award.
whoa.
all right.
how'd you know all of these guns were gonna be here?
it's a Chechen hangout.
owner doesn't like guns in the club, so these bozos leave them in their cars.
learn a lot in three years?
Yeah.
you sleeping?
I was.
jet-lag.
jeez, when was the last time we were in a car together?
drive home from Trenton.
I had to bail you out for that weapons charge.
yeah?
no, it was the fire thing, right?
when you set South Philly on fire, you mean?
we had to take out a second mortgage on the house to make your bail.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
it was funny.
are we really going to Chernobyl?
Yeah.
the Chernobyl.
the radioactive joint? Meltdown?
that's the one.
it's not the Chernobyl in Switzerland, right?
with all the skiing and the snow and everything?
you mean Grenoble?
no, sorry, we're not going to Grenoble.
Eddie Collins's kid took him on vacation last year.
they went down to Boca.
Oh, yeah?
spent four days at the track.
well, that's nice.
that's relaxing.
Oh, yeah. Sure.
we have to go to Chernobyl?
Yeah, sorry about that.
but all the radioactive stuff is out, right?
is it as you remember, papa?
I don't want to remember.
tough.
the file is in the inner vault.
very touching. Let's move.
which one is it?
get moving, old goat.
couple of fresh coats of paint and a weedwacker and it's good to go.
you know, at first, they denied anything even happened.
held a children's parade the next day to prove it.
24 hours later, 50, 000 residents were evacuated.
never came back.
as soon as they get in that vault, Komarov's a dead man.
all right.
you got a plan?
not really.
I kind of thought we'd just wing it.
you know, run in, guns blazing, making shit up as we go.
yeah? - Yeah.
what is this? A pirate gun?
Yeah. It's old school, man.
like you, right?
Yeah, like me.
one of these days, I'm gonna have a long talk with you.
look, Jack,
I'm sorry your partner got killed.
I'm sorry I fucked up your day. That wasn't my plan.
I caused you problems.
you know, I came here for something else.
and all that other bullshit. I mean,
I had a pretty good day.
it's fun, running around with you.
it's good to see you.
I love you, boy.
you, too.
I want you to know I got your back.
I got yours, too.
all right. Let's go kill some motherfuckers.
key.
okay, what the fuck is this?
I'm losing my patience. The fucking file better be here.
radiation has been pooling in this room for decades.
you've underestimated us, Daddy dearest.
bring it in!
Atta boy.
come on! Come on!
compound 27-4. It neutralizes radiation, trust me.
all clear. We can ditch the suits.
the hell is that?
one billion euros worth of enriched uranium.
what?
don't worry, it's stable in this form.
file!
Irina, cut the crap, please.
no one here is speaking about uranium. Where's the file?
no more games, where is the file?
that's no longer your concern.
sunshine...
you did well.
I told you...
everything would work out.
come to papa.
pap, You're a genius.
I know.
load it up.
Pegasus?
do you copy?
a lot of hardware for a file.
wheels up in five minutes.
perfect.
here you go, Sir.
team extraction completed. She's all yours.
good...
are you inside?
Yes, yes, Viktor.
I'm inside.
Yuri?
you surprised?
I'm in the same place where it all started before you betrayed me.
remember...
you promised to give me my life back.
you gave it back to me.
I thank you for that.
and now...
I'm going to take yours.
static 4, we are ready for take off.
static 4, do you copy?
Yuri!
Yuri.
Where's the dancer?
you okay? You hurt?
no.
I'm good.
I'm all right.
what's in these boxes?
thank God you're here, Jack.
we have to leave.
they're coming back any minute.
just let me get the file.
what's in the boxes?
it's U-235.
weapons-grade uranium.
armored cases.
the bomb kind?
Yeah, the bomb kind.
not so fast, Eddie.
are you crazy?
Yeah, a little bit.
I'm getting the file.
no. No, you're not.
the key. It's your vault, isn't it, Yuri?
what? No. No, I...
you put this shit in here, right?
what? No.
right?
I didn't know, Jack.
is that the dancer down there?
what are you talking about?
that's a tough break for a good athlete.
Jack, you know me.
Yeah, I know you. I know you.
I know him better.
never was a file, was there, Yuri?
of course there was no file.
it was simply bait.
what I needed was in this vault.
Chagarin was the only one with enough power and influence to get me out of jail.
I used him.
I used you.
it's about money.
when's it not about money?
you want to arrest me?
you're out of your jurisdiction, Detective McClane, aren't you?
I wouldn't worry too much about being arrested.
see, my boy is in the CIA.
no phone call.
spy shit.
goddamn Americans. You think you're so smart.
no, I'm not that smart. I'm just on vacation.
my boy here.
he gonna put a whooping on you.
move!
you can say goodbye to your daughter, you dumbwit fuck.
Where's your little Soltschanitsa?
shit! God damn it!
shit!
Irina, I'm going to the roof...
the roof!
Jack!
set at 91.
power plant?
all good to go.
let's go!
subtle.
what the hell is in those goddamn grenades?
go get him!
I'm going to the helicopter!
Vadim, watch the tail.
copy. You are at 120 meters...
115 meters...
there is small arms fire coming from the roof.
we have a guest.
hatch the tail for me there.
come on!
come on, hurry!
Vadim, give me firing control now...
Engaging!
Jack!
shoot him!
with pleasure, papa.
I'm on fucking vacation!
Vadim! He is there! I see him!
the shit we do for our kids.
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.
what happened?
CG's shifted...
I've got full forward cyclic.
I can't hold it.
Jesus Christ!
well done,
Mr. Super-spy.
what a shame your father won't be alive to see you promoted.
neither will you.
Hey! Jack!
hang on, John!
John!
come on!
we're out of ammunition!
shit.
bastards.
what the hell are you doing?
this is for you, papa.
John!
John!
John!
John!
dad!
right here.
did you just call me Dad?
no.
I didn't think so.
you're hearing things.
you got swimmer's ear.
we're not gonna grow any third arms or anything, are we?
no.
you might lose your hair.
laugh it up, kid.
this is you, five years from now.
it's rainwater. You'll be fine.
besides, it's hard to kill a McClane.
now you're a McClane?
Yeah, I'm a McClane. John McClane.
John McClane Junior.
well, that makes you a senior.
that's right.
try not to forget it.
I'm your father.
have some respect for your father.
let me ask you something.
do you go looking for trouble or does it always just seem to find you?
you know, after all these years,
I still ask myself the same question.
# I had a dream last night that I was piloting a plane #
# And all the passengers were drunk and insane #
# I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp #
# Shot up a horde of zombies but I come out on top #
# What's it all about? #
# Guess it just reflects my mood #
# Sitting in the dirt feeling kind of hurt #
# All I hear is doom and gloom #
# And all is darkness #
# In my room #
# Through the light, your face I see #
# Baby, take a chance baby, won't you dance with me #
# Lost all that treasure in an overseas war #
# It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for #
# Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor #
# Put my feet up on the couch and lock all the doors #
# What's that funky noise? #
# Sitting in the dirt feeling kind of hurt #
# All I hear is doom and gloom #
# But when those drums #
# Go boom, boom, boom #
# Through the night #
# Your face I see #
# Baby, take a chance Baby, won't you dance with me #
# Yeah! #
# Baby, won't you dance with me #
# Ah, yeah #
# There's kids all picking at the garbage dump #
# I am running out of water so I better prime the pump #
# I am trying to stay sober but I end up drunk #
# We'll be eating dirt, living on the side of the road #
# There's some food for thought #
# Kind of makes your head explode #
# Feeling kind of hurt #
# Yeah! #
# But all I hear #
# Is doom and gloom #
# And all is darkness #
# In my room #
# Through the night #
# Your face I see #
# Baby, take a chance #
# Won't you dance with me #
# Yeah! #
# Come on! #
# Baby, won't you dance with me #
# I'm feeling kind of hurt #
# Baby, won't you dance with me #
# Oh, yeah! #
# Sitting in the dirt #
# Baby, won't you dance with me #
why would I be bleeding? - It's fucking blood, man.
were you dancing with some chick in there?
Yeah, so? - It's blood.
dude, that's not funny. - It's blood, dude.
but why would I be bleeding? Why the fuck would I be bl...?
dude, why would there be bl...?
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.
Oh, shit. I'm gonna fucking throw up.
someone perioded on my fucking leg?
Oh, shit. - What the fuck do I do?
I've never before seen that in my life!
this is so disgusting.
Yes, it is. - I'm gonna go get Bill.
he's gotta check this shit out. - Fuck, yeah.
no. Who's Bill? Don't tell Bill! Bill has nothing to do with this!
Hey, calm down. Let me get a picture of that real quick.
no, you can't have a picture!
dude, stop! - Bill, Bill! Check it out!
this kid's got period blood on his slacks.
it's Merlot. That's what you don't get.
Hey, Pat! This jerk-off's got period blood on his pants!
please stop. - God, man, let me see.
Oh, my God, that's a fucking man-gina, man.
do you need a tampon? I could-- - wait, wait. I have one! I have one!
Yeah, right? I don't know.
I gotta wash this off. Is this the line? - What does it look like?
fuck me, right?
"yeah, I'm McLovin. I'd like to buy some..."
shit.
rewind, rewind. - Rewind it. Yeah!
so hot. Let's see it again.
your legs lifted off the ground. - That is bona fide badass, man.
you gotta keep that tape, McLovin. It is badass.
it really is. - Really?
well, don't you guys, need it for, like, evidence or...?
the only thing that's evidence of is you can take a hit like a champ.
seriously. Take that.
are there any ladies we'd like to show this tape to?
no. You don't wanna meet a chick in a bar, man. Seriously.
that was a turning point in my life, when I realized that.
you gotta go to other places. You gotta go to a spin class, a farmers' market...
...pumpkin patch, given the time of year.
just somewhere social, non-threatening.
you know, something like that. - Yeah, I met the missus at paintball.
Yeah, I shot her in the neck. And we just... .
and we just hit it off, you know.
my first wife-- who is a whore, by the way.
where do you think I met her?
a bar. A bar.
it was this bar. - It was this bar.
Yeah, it was this bar.
bought her a Binion's, complimented her on her tote bag...
...and next thing I know, she's putting her mouth around the tip of my penis.
you don't have to tell me that.
right in there. - She opened up my world, sexually.
on our wedding night, we had group sex.
I wasn't involved in it.
but I could hear it through the wall. - I was.
she was amazing. And then it was exactly 23 months later...
...that I found out she was an actual whore.
we discovered her on the street. - Yeah.
I'm sorry.
she was bad. Fucking whoring bitch.
but you got a new wife now, so... . - Yeah. Yeah.
and she is wonderful.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You'll meet her.
you know what? I bet I know your trick, McLovin.
you play the whole myst...-- Calling all units.
just turn that off.
send backup! There's so much blood...
I bet you play the whole mysterious-guy thing, right?
Yeah, seriously. How's it going with the ladies?
it's not the going with the ladies I care about...
...It's the coming.
I get it. - What is it? What is it?
like:
like coming.
that's funny. That is really funny. - Oh, my God.
all right, looks like we got a call. We can't pay for these.
10-4. We'll be right there.
speedy Gonzales, let's go. - We should get road beers.
hell, yeah, we should get some road beers.
can I have 13 beers to go, please?
please. God, my fucking leg.
fuck.
I think it's him. - Is it him?
Hello? - Hey, Becca.
Hi, I had a bad reception. So about your Gold slick... .
guys, shut up. - Hey, what's going on over there?
it's nothing. It's just...
I was just calling, you know, to see if you were coming...
...because I thought maybe you were stuck at, like, a nightclub...
...or a cocktail party or something.
no, no, I'm gonna be there for sure. Full throttle.
Charlie's Angels 2. - Awesome.
I can't wait to see you. Evan? - Okay, bye.
that was the first time I ever did coke. Off that bitch's nipple. That was so...
a little white sniff. - That was awesome.
that was gorgeous.
Hey, hey, hey. You guys, stay in this room, man.
they're gonna kill that guy tonight. That chick's boyfriend is pissed.
Yeah. He's a beast.
I've been praying for a fight. I'm literally waking up and praying...
...to see a fucking fight. - Hey, hey, hey.
who's that guy?
Hi. - Who is that guy?
who's this guy? - Pleasure to see you fellas.
Hi, everyone.
who are you? - I'm nobody.
no, no, no. I know you. I know you.
he was at that party I was telling you about.
no, no. - Who is it?
remember? He's Jimmy's brother. The guy. The singer.
no. - He's the guy with the beautiful voice.
the fucking singer, Jimmy's brother! - That's not me, man.
Oh, my God. - Sing for us! Sing.
"it's not me"? You fucking lying?
no, I don't mean to accuse you guys of being ill-informed, but...
my brother came from Scottsdale, Arizona to be here.
you're not gonna sing for him?
fucking bullshit. - Sing.
you're a fucking singer. - You sing good.
sing it again. - Like a bird.
no, I know, I just...I want to--- You want a line of cocaine?
no way, man. - Yeah.
don't make this weird. Sing.
sing it again. - Turbo.
fuck! Over! - Okay, watch this.
I'll get it right on the nose.
you're gonna fuck it up. You're gonna fuck it up.
under!
I feel hammered. That doesn't make any sense.
you're a fucking pussy. - Okay, okay. Great, great.
okay, McLovin, see if you can do it. - The kid's gonna nail it.
come on, McLovin. Do it, buddy. Come on, buddy!
bring it! - 0. 08, motherfuckers!
man! - That's my boy!
Yes! - Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.
so, what's it like to have guns?
it is awesome, McLovin.
I mean, it's mindbl...-- It's great.
I haven't had one for long, a few months, but I'll tell you...
...It's like having two cocks. - Yup.
if one of your cocks could kill someone.
can I hold one? - What?
can I hold one of your guns?
Yeah, sure. - Fine with me. Why not?
everyone should hold a gun at least a couple times.
Yeah, there you go.
have a blast. - Have a blast.
that's funny. - I've never held one of these before.
are they hard to shoot? - If you're Michaels, they are.
he can't shoot worth dick. - What?
I can shoot. What are you--? Wait.
I can't shoot worth dick? - You cannot shoot.
I shot that cat last week. - It was already dead, man.
I still shot it. - That cat was dead.
there's only one way to settle this, guys.
Shoot-off. - Shoot-off.
Shoot-off! - Shoot-off!
there's a lot of reasons why I like you.
I mean, you're handsome and you're a good friend.
dude, there he is. That's the guy. Hey, Mark, right there.
Oh, you got a stain too.
we're blood brothers. - Shut the fuck up.
you're in my house, you answer my questions.
what were you doing dancing with Jacinda?
I don't even dance. I just...
I don't even dance ever, so...I've never even tried it.
then where the hell did this come from, asshole?
maybe you and I rubbed up against each other at some point.
I don't remember. Maybe it was some ricochet scenario. I don't know.
how am I supposed to know? - Kick his ass, Mark.
shut the fuck up, Scarlett.
to some girl.
talk about the hurting.
shit. - All right.
yo! Fight! - Move it!
go, check this out! - Oh, fuck!
and what the hell is this?
I don't fucking...It's detergent. - Yeah, what are you doing with it?
I got fucking blood on my pants.
get down.
what the fuck is this all about, man? Are you--?
well, fuck me. - Fellas.
Oh, shit, I've been tackled by little girls!
you die! You're next!
I should fucking kill you, you motherfucker!
hold him, Jimmy's brother! Hold him! - what do you mean? No. No way!
you humiliated me! - I'm sorry!
you used my leg as a tampon! - I'm calling the cops.
Evan! Come on! Move!
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
Yeah. Fifth and Paysview. Hurry.
mark, I called the cops. You should hide your gun.
you're a fucking pussy.
don't listen to him, officer.
if you make this, we're no longer friends, Michaels.
you're a fucking pussy. - Cheating. You're cheating.
fuck me. - Oh, suck on my nuts, Slater!
all right, you...That was a lucky shot.
that was a lucky shot. - I rule.
I got jizzed on. All right.
can I shoot one? - Yeah, go nuts. Go nuts.
have a good time, man.
empty the clip. Empty the clip on it, man. Shit!
the cops! Bail! Bail! Bail! Shotgun, shotgun! Damn it!
shotgun.
what a rush. - What do you guys wanna do?
man, let's get drunk! - Let's get more fucked up!
you're fucking living the dream, Michaels!
Oh, man.
this is gonna be the best night ever.
got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview. - Shit.
all units in the area report to Fifth and Paysview.
car 98, that's you. Do it. - Fuck.
shit. - Shit.
car 98 on it. You dumb fucking whore.
Hey, did she say we're gonna get to shoot somebody or something?
Oh, God, I wish.
it's probably some lame house party. We'll drop you off after. Cool?
Yeah, man. Let's show these fuckers how we roll!
you fucking prick. - What?
you bailed on me. - I didn't bail on you.
Yeah, you did.
you said you were gonna do something and you didn't do it.
that's bailing.
you're the one that dragged me to that fucking party with those lunatics.
I didn't bail on you. - You bailed on me, okay?
you bailed on me this morning when Jesse spat on me...
...and you're bailing on me next year.
what the fuck? It finally comes out. That's good, man.
we were supposed to go to college together.
since we were kids, since elementary school...
...that's all we've ever talked about, us going together.
and you got into fucking Dartmouth.
you're making me feel like I'm a bad guy.
What...? I didn't do anything wrong. I got into a good school.
how the fuck am I supposed to get into Dartmouth? You knew I couldn't.
how fucking selfish are you?
you had no problem letting Fogell take the fall.
you don't want me going to a good school.
fuck, man! - So, what the fuck do you want?
I'm not gonna let you slow me down anymore, Seth.
what are you saying?
I've wasted the last three years sitting around talking bullshit with you.
instead of chasing girls and making friends...
...l've just sat around wasting all my time with you.
and now I'm going to college a fucking friendless virgin.
is this about Becca? This is about some girl, man?
I like her! - who gives a fuck?
she's some fucking girl! You gonna go out with her?
what about after that? - Fuck you, you're a piece of shit.
fuck you! And next time you're pissed off about something...
...don't keep it inside for 10 years, say it like a fucking man!
don't touch me. - Fuck you!
Hey, McLovin, are the numbers on your side odd or even?
I don't know. It's too dark to see. - We got flashlights.
Oh, that's true.
where the fuck are we?
Hey, Slater. - What's that?
Slater.
now, young Michaels, you will die.
all right. Come on, stop it. I can't fucking see. I can't see. Fuck it.
like it? - Hey, fuck off, that hurts.
you stop first. - Not until you stop.
stop it, asshole. - Hey, you stop.
fuck you, Evan! - Don't fucking touch me.
why did you do that?
you shined the light in my face. - You did too.
I'm driving. - We were playing Lightsabers.
excuse me. - Oh, my God.
are you guys gonna make sure he's okay?
check on him. - You check.
you go out there and check on him. - Fuck that. You go.
balls. Okay, we'll both go out there and check on him.
I can't believe this is happening again. What are the odds?
fuck.
is everyone okay? - Yeah, we're great, thanks.
Hey, hey, where's the love?
he's okay. He's fine. - Stand right next to your friend.
get over there. - I got them.
you got these guys?
you boys doing a bit of drinking tonight?
no, officer. Not at all. Not...we--we found those.
I don't believe you.
freeze. Stand right there.
we're telling the truth. - Keep it going.
don't be a hero tonight, guys. - Wrong night for that.
you gotta fucking take care of this.
no. Look, I am not fixing your mistakes again, okay? Fuck that shit.
I don't wanna get shitcanned. I like this job.
me too. I get free haircuts. I'm not taking the fall.
okay, okay!
we're gonna arrest these two little dipshits, okay?
and we're gonna pin it on them.
Yeah, do what you have to do.
spread your shit!
get on the ground! Loaded gun, ready to go!
spread your shit! Pussies on the pavement, fellas.
come on! - Please don't shoot, sir.
"please don't shoot." Shut up and spread your shit!
I am the law! Okay?
now hold hands.
what? - why?
you don't want an asshole where your face used to be, whaling Jennings.
hold his fucking hand! - Fucking hold my hand.
there. That's not so hard, is it?
here, McLovin, have a cigarette.
smoke up. Life's short, you know.
suck it in, my friend.
suck it long and deep.
enjoy it.
McLovin, McLovin, McLovin.
you like Officer Slater and myself? - Yeah, you guys are awesome.
Thanks. We really like you too, McLovin.
so here's what's about to happen.
we're gonna arrest these guys...
...you're gonna write a witness report saying they leapt in front of our car...
...and there was nothing we could do. Sound cool?
Yeah, that's fine. - Good.
that's good. Pretend he's your little sister.
your little sister with the... .
what the fuck?
Fagell?
shit! - Shit!
run! Run!
wait.
hold on, I gotta get all the booze. Seth, wait up!
McLovin bailed!
chase the kid!
stop!
that was a fast kid.
I want a ride! You hear me? You can't unarrest me!
stop!
McLovin! - Come on.
McLovin!
McLovin! why?
McLovin, come back!
my hand! Monster! Nicole! Nicole, get Daddy.
get Daddy. - Get Daddy!
Oh, shit. - Get away from my kids!
you sick sons of bitches!
what the fuck?
Michaels, are you okay?
it's just beer. - Give me a break.
it's just beer. - Man up.
what happened? What, did you lose him?
he's a freak. He's the fastest kid alive.
this is not good. - He's the fastest kid alive.
fastest kid alive, my ass. Come on. What are we gonna do?
I'll shoot my gun in the air.
give me a fucking warning before you do it.
I'll scare him out of wherever he's hiding.
this isn't gonna do shit. Get in the car. Get in the car.
this is your fault, you piece of...
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. They shot Seth.
they fucking shot Seth, I know it.
holy shit.
holy shit. Holy shit.
should I run? - Yes.
fuck. Stop! - Stop the bus!
stop it! - It's stopping.
it's stopping. - Oh, thank God.
Hey, Evan, pay for me, please.
that's me and him.
Hey, hey. It's you.
mcmuffin.
you know this guy? - It's...
ain't got no cop people to help you keep your booze now, do you?
Hey! Back the fuck up, man, or I'll beat the shit out of you.
give me the booze. - Hey! Back the fuck up.
back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.
please, please, calm down, sir.
Goldslick.
get off the bus or I'm calling the cops.
eat shit, bum.
Oh, shit, guys. We're three blocks away, man.
we made it. We made it with the booze and everything.
we made it.
hold this.
I can't believe you still have the liquor.
it's awesome.
Yeah, I told you the idea would work. I fooled those cops.
I'm McLovin. I am McLovin.
why do you guys have detergent?
I don't understand why you were smoking cigarettes with those cops.
because I fucking rule.
we are so gonna get laid tonight. - I am. I'm gonna get laid.
we're finally gonna get our drinks on.
I can't believe Becca's bottle broke.
I'm sure it'll be fine. - Yeah.
I thought you didn't need it. You were gonna tell her how you feel.
good luck getting Jules drunk enough to have sex with you.
what's wrong with you guys? - Nothing.
you two femmes can talk about it next year at your little slumber party.
Oh, you told him.
told me what? - Yeah. You're an idiot, Fogell.
well, we gotta tell him now. - No, we...
well, he knows something's up.
what are you guys talking about? Tell me now.
Seth, me and Evan are rooming together next year.
what's the big deal?
"Oh, my God, Fogell's rooming with Evan."
jeez, why don't you go cry about it?
I didn't tell you because... - You're a backstabber...
...and you lied to your best friend and you just don't care anymore?
I didn't expect this from you, Evan.
not from you.
give me that booze, Fagell.
we never should have had to hide our arrangement.
Seth's here. - Seth, you're here.
Hi. Everybody, Seth has got it.
Evan. - Gaby, hey.
where have you been? You almost blew it.
what are you talking about? - Becca. She's been waiting.
she's over there.
she's way smashed.
and she's been yammering about you all night.
Really? What was she saying?
she told you that she thinks I'm a good guy?
no, no. She said something more like:
"I will fully blow him tonight."
what? - I know.
Yeah. - But she's totally hammered...
...and if I get with her and I'm not drunk, isn't that unethical?
not if you're drunk too.
I guess not.
to Seth.
to Seth! - All right.
who the fuck is Seth?
I'm Seth!
let's do another one to me.
Oh, boy.
calm down. Calm down, man.
calm down. She likes you.
she wants to suck on your penis.
it's a good thing.
it's the best thing.
just down the hatch.
Fogell. what's up?
Evan, hey. Evie, come here.
can you please help me up?
I fell down and none of these assholes will help me up.
shit. - Becca.
I have been waiting for you for, ever.
what took you so long? - I know, I...
do you have my Goldslick? - No, I can't even...
it's such a crazy story, okay?
I swear I was try...- It doesn't even matter.
look. What we...we can just drink this.
here. You could have a drink. - Oh, no.
I'm already pretty wasted. - Take a drink.
okay, here's to you. This is to Becca.
to Becca.
to the respecting...- Guys.
women. To people respecting women.
okay. Yeah.
you're a lightweight.
Hey.
you and me, we should go upstairs, because...
because I need to tell you something. Okay?
you could just tell me here, I mean... .
I can't tell you, because it's a secret for you from me.
all right. - So come. Come on. Okay.
Bye, guys. - Bye.
Bye-bye. - Bye.
you changed your name to McLovin?
that's so cool. - Thanks.
so, what's Hawaii like?
all right. I am back.
I had to thank the peeps for coming out, you know.
Jules. I want you to have a drink with me.
just drink some of this. You're gonna love it.
you're to...I know you're gonna love it.
you know, l... - It's green beer. For your information.
you know, I'm actually good right now. But thank you.
and thank you very much for bringing everything, again.
seriously, it really made the night.
no, that's how I roll. That's the thing.
it's no problems. You'll learn that.
I love talking and conversing with you.
but I can't hear you, though, because the music is so loud.
so do you wanna go outside and talk more?
Yeah. Sorry, sure. You know, why not?
let's do it. I haven't conversed in ages.
okay. Ladies...Ladies first. - Okay.
thank you very much. - No problem.
watch your step. I fell earlier today. - You serious?
well, I was hit by a car. It's a long story.
Oh, shit. Careful. - Okay, well...
so loud. Don't let the parents hear.
you look so pretty.
are you okay? - I so flirt with you in math.
tell me about it. I... Samesies.
I've wanted to tell you for so long that you're the best girl.
I know. I've wanted to get with you, like, so hard.
like so hard.
you're the best.
we'll take this sweater off. I think so.
just be careful, because it's a meaningful sweater to me. It's vintage.
okay.
bought it at that vintage market. - Just hurry.
and this one. - It's off.
Hey, wait, careful.
Oh, shit. - Oh, my god.
put that there.
now, looky, looky... - Okay.
...what I got for you under here. - Oh, my gosh.
you are the prettiest girl...
...this side of the Mississippi. - I have a little something...
...for you under here.
you look so pretty.
look so pretty. - Under there.
hello.
for you.
you're the best. You're so unique.
come here.
Evan, kiss me.
I like you so much.
come on, McLovin.
I've never been with an older guy before.
well, it's way better.
I know, we made some kick-ass tiramisu earlier.
it was deli...It looked weird. But it was delicious.
what--? What's wrong?
I...I would prefer if we would just do that...
...at some other time.
no. There is no other time. School is up.
what's wrong with right now? - Well, I mean, you're...you're drunk.
you're, really, really drunk. - So? You're drunk. You're drunk, Jules.
Yeah, I'm actually...I'm not drunk at all.
I don't even drink, so it's... . I mean... .
Jules, you drink. You drink.
Everybody...you...you had me get liquor, so you drink.
it's like... .
well, yeah, because I'm throwing a party, remember?
other people drink and so I just... .
you...?
you don't wanna, you know?
not right now.
you know, not while you're drunk.
but, you know, thank you.
Evan. Evan, I'm so wet. - Oh, yeah.
they said that would happen in health, when I learned about it.
Yeah. - Yeah.
they taught me about... - Who's down there?
Yeah, it's your hand.
thank you, that's good. - You have such a smooth cock.
thank you. You would too if you were a man.
but you got such a smooth chest.
I am gonna give you...
...the best blow-J ever...
...with my mouth.
why don't we...? why don't we just kiss a while?
why don't we keep kissing for a bit, instead of...?
how badly do you wanna fuck me?
Jesus Christ.
Jesus, fuck.
hang on one second. - What?
Becca, I don't think you wanna do this.
you're really drunk. - No, I'm not. I am not drunk.
I see that you are. I think you are. - And I really...I want you inside me.
I want you to be my first. I want you inside me.
so just...just go with it.
let it happen. - I know, but... .
Becca, this is kind of intense.
and I just...I'm so drunk. I can't even, like, process this.
and you're really pretty.
and I just think this isn't how I pictured it.
I don't understand why you have to be such a little bitch about it.
did you just call me a bitch? - Yes, a scared...
see, I, like, I think we're not thinking clear...
holy shit. Oh, my God.
go get Gaby. - I'll go get her.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Go get Gaby, please.
I got a boner. - Good.
do you have a condom? - Yes.
and lube.
Seth?
are...? Are you crying?
no, I just have something in both my eyes.
I don't cry. That's funny.
you look...you look...It looks like you're crying.
so...
it was my last chance and I fucked it up and...
your last chance to do what?
to make you my girlfriend for the summer.
you're, like, the coolest person that's ever talked to me.
I thought we'd both be drunk.
what does me being drunk have anything to do with it?
you'd never get with me if you were sober.
look at you.
look at me. - Seth, come on, you didn't blow it.
I think maybe...
what the fuck?!
help me.
Shirley.
I'm sorry.
someone forgot to call pest control. - Yep.
where you going? Hey, party's still on.
where are you going? - No.
if you're back there, get out. Everyone, come on.
we will shoot you. - Party's over.
Evan. - Get the hell out of here.
keep your hands up.
life's bullshit, Miroki.
Evan, wake the fuck up, man.
we gotta go. Those fucking cops are here, man.
Oh, no, it's the cops." we have a complaint.
Evan, come on. - Get the hell out of here right now.
get out of here. She's not interested.
drop the crantini and move it, sister. - See you, sugar tits.
guys, come on, move.
everybody out. Leave the booze and go.
what the fuck, man?
what the fuck, Seth?
he's my best friend. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Come on.
I assume you all have guns and crack.
Oh, my God, come on. Don't stop.
okay, everyone...
...prepare to be fucked by the long dick of the law.
get out.
come on, go.
fuck off, Seth.
get a room.
I'm gonna save you. I'm gonna save you, Evan.
fuck.
fuck. Fuck, man, so heavy.
it's in. Oh, my God, it's in.
all right, everybody out. Come on, let's go.
McLovin! What the fuck?
officer Slater, is that you? - You ran away from us.
why did you run away? Michaels, get up here.
no. I didn't run away. - What the fuck?
why would you do that?
I was disoriented from... - Were you violating that girl?
you just violated her with your penis? Michaels, look.
McLovin? - No, no, no.
no.
holy shit. Were you just getting laid?
no. Yeah, I was, but...
Yes, yes, he was. - It's not what you think, guys.
I'm not even...- Sit the fuck down. Stay down.
calm down. - I thought we were friends...
...and then you go running away.
contain yourself.
we're friends. - Shut up.
calm down. Calm down, man. - Why? What?
you just cock-blocked McLovin. Okay?
he's our friend. We don't do that.
we should be guiding his cock, not blocking it.
just relax, okay? Let's make this right.
wait, what are you--? What are you guys doing?
no, please, I can't...I can't go to jail. Please, I can't go to jail.
no, look. we're really sorry, McLovin.
this has...This has gone on...This has gone way too far.
what? What are you talking about?
we know you're not 25, man. We're not idiots, McLovin.
Yeah. - Did you know the whole time?
look, when we were your age, we hated cops.
when we saw you in the liquor store today, we just...
I guess we saw a bit of ourselves, you know...
...and we just wanted to show you that...
...you know, cops can have a fun time too, you know?
Yeah.
you know, in a way, I think we wanted to show ourselves.
also, I'm... .
I'm really sorry that I blocked your cock.
apology accepted. - Seriously, man.
that feels good.
it feels so good. - I missed you guys.
I just wish we could make it up to you somehow, man.
well, do you think you can do me a really big favor?
what is it? Anything. - Name it.
this kid's fucking crazy. - Stay back for your own safety.
get off me, you fucking cops. Get your hands off.
do you know who I am? I'm Fogell.
the joint can't hold me. - Holy shit, Fogell's a badass.
I'm gonna break your glasses, you fucking cop. You can't hold me.
fucking pigs.
Oh, shit.
nice mullet, asshole.
you crazy. - This kid's crazy.
he's nuts. well, we caught the infamous Fogell.
get your hands...wait for me, Nicola.
wait for me on the outside.
we were gonna go to Hawaii.
man, that's gonna get you so much ass.
Seriously?
I know what to do about the car. - Sweet.
fucking go. Fucking throw up.
are you carrying me?
no, I'm saving you from the cops.
you saved me?
well, I don't know what you're talking about, but thanks.
can l...Should I just walk?
should I walk? - Yeah, sure.
okay. - Where do you wanna go?
sleepover at my house? You wanna come sleep...?
okay. - Okay.
does your mom still have pizza bagels?
Yeah. Lots.
pizza bagels.
so by signing this, you are officially saying...
...that as we stopped you from being mugged...
...a crackhead stole our cruiser and did God knows what with it.
you cool to sign that? - Of course. I owe you guys my life.
we owe you, Mc...wait, what's your real name again?
Fogell. - Fuck that.
we're calling you McLovin. - McLovin.
let's do this dance, boys.
Oh, my God. - What did I tell you guys, right?
that was crazy.
all right.
all right, now, guys, check this out.
it's probably the greatest move in doughnut-spinning history.
you paying attention?
behold, the upward-spiraling pigtail.
why is it called that? - I don't know.
make the badge proud, Slater.
he's not usually this drunk when he does this...
...but I think that could make it more cool.
McLovin!
Oh, no.
fuck.
Slater! - Officer Slater.
all right. Fucking crazy.
let's do this.
hurry, hurry. Let's go. Go, go. - I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
I'm out, I'm out. - Good, here we go, here we go.
yeah? Yeah, okay. Back up.
don't blow yourself up, asshole.
Yes. Oh, my God.
it worked. It worked.
we won. We won.
can we shoot at it?
I don't know. Can you?
break yourself, fool.
tight.
listen, and then she said she was gonna give me a blow-J.
I can't believe she said that to you. - Man, you have no idea.
what was she thinking? - You don't even know.
I gotta tell you. I gotta tell you something, Evan.
what?
I was in your room, like, three weeks ago...
...while you were taking a shit.
and I saw your housing, like, forms.
so I knew you and Fogell were gonna live together, you know.
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.
I should've told you. I don't know why I didn't.
Don't...No, don't be sorry. I should be sorry.
I was being a dick. I was being a big dick to you.
no, l...
listen, Seth, I want you to know, I don't wanna live with Fogell.
I never wanted to live with him. I just don't...I ha...
I'm afraid to live with strangers.
I can't.
I can't do it.
I know, I know.
I can't believe you saved me.
you saved me.
I can't believe. I owe you so...
you carried me. I love you.
I love you, man.
I love you.
I love you. I'm not even embarrassed to say it. I just...
I lo...I love you.
I'm not embarrassed. - I love you.
I love you.
why don't we say that every day? Why can't we say it more often?
I just love you. I just wanna go to the rooftops and scream:
I love my best friend, Evan.
we should go up on my roof. - For sure.
like, when you went away for Easter, on your vacation, I missed you.
I missed you too. - I want the world to know.
it's...it's the most beautiful thing in the world.
come here. Come here, man.
I love you. - I love you.
what the fuck?
what up? - Morning. Morning.
I should get moving. I should get moving.
I should be getting a move on, for sure.
Yeah, you don't...I mean, you don't have to, you know.
I don't really have anything going on.
you don't have to rush off like that.
you wanna hang out?
I was gonna go to the mall.
I have to get a new comforter.
for college. The mall, they would sell that.
cool. So...
...your mom's got huge tits.
what do you think?
I don't know, man. Don't ask me.
because I don't give a shit how pants look.
Yeah, I need someone's opinion.
those are too tight. Those are way too tight.
Yeah, but, like...- way too tight. You need to upgrade.
there's not enough pants where there should be. More pants.
Yeah, but...I mean, does it look weird?
looks like you're standing funny. You wouldn't stand like that. Like a duck.
Yeah, but I'm doing like...
I'm doing the college poses like...- I don't know if you are.
you might just be doing...- Hey, prof.
okay. - That test was...
Hey, Susan. Are you gonna party tonight or no?
Yeah, but that's just...It's like I wish there were more pants where...
you know, where there aren't.
but when I was wearing your dad's pants...
...I realized that if I wear pants that are a little too small...
...it might encourage me to lose weight.
and also, chicks can kind of see, like...
...you know, the borders and outline of my dick a little.
Yeah, man, they go nuts for that. The male camel toe.
Yeah, the camel tail. It's right...
I know where it is, where it happens.
like, right there.
it's like they're so tight that one ball is, like, above my dick, even.
Yeah, exactly. - It's like three.
it's like a three thing. It's like ball, dick, ball.
it's like a division sign.
like a bunch of people crammed into a van.
making my ass look weird? - It makes a lot of stuff look weird.
no, those are way too tight.
you're right, these look stupid. Let's get the fuck out of here.
I'm really sorry about that. I can't believe I actually did that.
I feel bad that I'm making you buy me a new one.
it's seems, like, ridiculous.
no. I have to, it's puke. It's gross. - Oh, my God.
do alcoholics get hangovers?
holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. It's them.
what the fuck do we do, man? - Don't stop. I don't know.
Hey. - Hey.
how's it going?
it's so good to...How are you feeling?
I've felt better. But I'll be fine. How about you?
I'm okay, you know, yeah. Did you have fun last night?
you know, I actually don't remember much.
I don't remember anything.
so weird. - Nothing.
I didn't puke on you, did I?
you didn't. I remember that you...I avoided it.
it whizzed right by me, and I said, "Stay away from me," you know.
I'm really sorry about everything last night, and I just... .
thank you for being such a nice guy about it all.
that's okay, you know.
at least you don't have a black eye from it.
that looks terrible. - Yeah.
you look great. You don't look terrible. It's just, like, a bad bruise.
everything's great, just from he...This, just like right there.
your eye. - Yeah, your eye.
everything else is great.
but seriously, I acted like a fucking idiot last night.
you don't deserve that. So I'm sorry.
on the upside, I think you look cool with a black eye.
I'm just gonna throw that out there. I don't...I don't know.
well, thank you, smart guy. Thanks. That's actually why I'm here.
because I have to get a ton of cover-up for the grad photo.
Oh, man. Fuck.
and I'm gonna get Jules a new comforter.
I have to get a comforter too. For college.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah, I just figured I would need one.
so, Seth...
so do you wanna come buy me cover-up or something?
I mean, you kind of owe me.
Yeah, definitely. I would love to do that.
I had such bad acne last year...
...that I pretty much became, like, an expert on the stuff.
well, you drove. Evan drove me here, though, so...
well, so...well, I mean, I have my dad's car.
so I could just give you a lift...
...and then Evan could take Becca home.
if that works. I don't know if it's in your route.
it'd be fine with me.
fine, yeah. Maybe we can get some food.
Yeah, I'd like that.
so I guess I'll call you, then.
Yeah, give me a call. Yeah, you have my number.
I have your information. So put her there.
perfect. Good. All right, man.
okay. - Okay, guys.
Becca. - Bye, guys.
Bye, have fun. - See you, Jules.
Yeah, that's funny. Too funny.
where do you wanna go to eat?
so can you honestly help me figure out what kind of cover-up to get?
I love you.
who are you? We are three wise men.
what? We are three wise men.
well, what are you doing creeping around a cow shed at 2: 00 in the morning?
that doesn't sound very wise to me.
we are astrologers. We have come from the east.
is this some kind of joke?
we wish to praise the infant.
we must pay homage to him.
homage? You're drunk! It's disgusting!
out the door! Out! Bashing me with tales about oriental fortunetellers.
come on, out! No, no. We must see him.
go and praise someone else's brat. We were led by a star.
led by a bottle, more like. Go on out.
we must see him. We have brought presents.
out! Gold, frankincense, myrrh.
well, why didn't you say? He's over there.
sorry the place is a bit of a mess.
well, what is myrrh anyway? It is a valuable balm.
a balm? What are you giving him a balm for? It might bite him.
what? That's a dangerous animal.
no, it isn't. Yes, it is.
it's great big and no, it is an ointment.
well, there is an animal called a balm... or did I dream it?
so you're astrologers, are you? Well, what is he, then?
hmm? What star sign is he?
well, Capricorn. Capricorn, eh? What are they like?
he is the Son of God, our Messiah.
king of the Jews!
that's Capricorn, is it? No, that's just him.
Oh, I was gonna say, otherwise there would be a lot of them.
by what name are you calling him? Uh, Brian.
we worship you, O Brian, who are lord over us all.
praise unto you, Brian, and to the Lord, our Father. Amen.
you do a lot of this, then? What?
this praising. No, no, no, no.
well, if you're dropping by again, do pop in.
and thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense.
but don't worry too much about the myrrh next time, all right?
thank you. Goodbye.
well, weren't they nice?
out of their bloody minds, but still... look at that!
here! Here!
that that's mine! Hey, he's a baby! Oh!
shut up!
Brian
the babe they called Brian
he grew
grew, grew and grew
grew up to be
grew up to be
a boy called Brian
a boy called Brian
he had arms and legs
and hands and feet
this boy
whose name was Brian
and he grew
grew, grew and grew
grew up to be
Yes, he grew up to be
a teenager called Brian
a teenager called Brian
and his face became spotty
Yes, his face became spotty
and his voice dropped down low
and things started to grow
on young Brian and show
he was certainly no
no girl named Brian
not a girl named Brian
and he started to shave
and have one off the wrist
and want to see girls
and go out and get pissed
a man called Brian
this man called Brian
the man they called Brian
this man called
bri
Aah!
how blessed are those who know that he's a god.
how blessed are the sorrowful. They shall find consolation.
how blessed are those of gentle spirit.
they shall have the earth for their possession.
how blessed are those who hunger and thirst to see right prevail.
they shall be satisfied.
how blessed are those whose hearts are pure.
they shall see God.
speak up! Shhh. Quiet, Mum.
well, I can't hear a thing. Let's go to the stoning.
Shhh! We can go to a stoning anytime.
Oh, come on, Brian. Will you be quiet?
don't pick your nose.
I wasn't picking my nose. I was scratching.
you was picking it while you was talking to that lady.
I wasn't. Leave it alone. Give it a rest.
do you mind? I can't hear a word he's saying.
don't you "do you mind" me! I was talking to my husband.
well, go and talk to him somewhere else. I can't hear a bloody thing.
don't you swear at my wife.
I was only asking her to shut up so we can hear what he's saying, Big Nose.
don't you call my husband "Big Nose." Well, he has got a big nose.
could you be quiet, please? What was that?
I was too busy talking to Big Nose.
I think it was, "Blessed are the cheese makers."
what's so special about the cheese makers?
well, obviously, it's not meant to be taken literally.
it refers to any manufacturers of dairy products.
see, if you hadn't been going on, we'd have heard that, Big Nose.
Hey! Say that once more, I'll smash your bloody face in.
better keep listening. Might be a bit about, "Blessed are the Big Noses."
Oh, lay off him.
Oh, you're not so bad yourself, Conch Face.
where are you two from, Nose City?
one more time, mate, I'll take you to fuckin' cleaners!
language! And don't pick your nose.
I wasn't gonna pick my nose. I was gonna thump him!
hear that? "Blessed are the Greek." The Greek?
well, apparently he's going to inherit the earth.
did anyone catch his name? You're not gonna thump anybody.
I'll thump him if he calls me "Big Nose" again.
Oh, shut up, Big Nose. Oh! Right. I warned you.
I really will slug you so hard oh, it's the meek!
"Blessed are the meek!" Oh, that's nice, isn't it?
I'm glad they're getting something, 'cause they have a hell of a time.
listen, I'm only telling the truth. You have got a very big nose.
Hey, your nose gonna be three foot wide across your face when I'm finished!
Shhh! Who hit yours, then? Goliath's big brother?
Oh. Right. That's your last warning.
Oh, do pipe down.
silly bitch. Get in the way on me.
Oh, come on. Let's go to the stoning.
all right.
blessed is just about anyone with a vested interest in the status quo.
well, what Jesus fails to appreciate is it's the meek who are the problem.
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg. Yes, I see.
Oh, come on, Brian. They're gonna stone him before we get there.
all right.
that's disgusting.
it's the chap with a big nose's fault. He started it all.
Oh, I hate wearing these beards.
why aren't women allowed to go to stonings, Mum?
it's written, that's why.
beard, madame?
Oh, look, I haven't got time to go to no stonings.
he's not well again.
stone, sir?
no, they got them up there, lying around on the ground.
Oh, not like these, sir. Look at this.
feel the quality of that. That's craftsmanship, sir.
well, all right. We'll have two with points and a big, flat one.
can I have a flat one, Mum? Shhh!
sorry. Dad. All right.
two points, two flats and a packet of gravel.
packet of gravel. Should be a good one this afternoon.
who? Local boy.
Oh, good. Enjoy yourselves.
Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath?
do I say yes? Yes. Yes.
you have been found guilty by the elders of the town...
of uttering the name of our Lord.
and so as a blasphemer...
you are to be stoned to death.
look, I'd had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was, "That piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah."
blasphemy! He said it again!
did you hear him?
really!
are there any women here today?
very well. By virtue of the authority vested in me
Ow! Lay off! We haven't started yet!
come on! Who threw that?
who threw that stone? Come on.
she did! She did!
he did! He did!
sorry. I thought we'd started.
go to the back.
always one, isn't there? Now, where were we?
look, I don't think it ought to be blasphemy, just saying "Jehovah."
you're only making it worse for yourself.
making it worse? How could it be worse?
Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!
I'm warning you, if you say "Jehovah" once more
right. Who threw that?
come on. Who threw that?
him, him, him.
was it you? Yes.
right Well, you did say "Jehovah."
stop! Will you stop that?
stop it! Now, look! No one is to stone anyone...
until I blow this whistle.
do you understand? Even and I want to make this absolutely clear
even if they do say "Jehovah."
good shot! Bravo!
have I got a big nose, Mum? Oh, stop thinking about sex.
I wasn't! You're always on about it, morning, noon and night.
will the girls like this? Will the girls like that?
is it too big? Is it too small?
here you are, mate.
bless you, sir. Alms for the poor.
alms for a leper. Alms for an exleper.
bloody donkey owners. All the same, ain't they?
never have any change. Oh, here's a touch.
spare a talent for an old exleper? Buzz off!
spare a talent for an old exleper?
a talent? That's more than he earns in a month!
half a talent, then. Now, go away!
come on, Big Nose, let's haggle. What?
you open at one shekel. I start at 2, 000. We close about 1, 800.
no. 1, 750?
go away! 1, 740?
leave him alone! All right, two shekels. Isn't this fun, eh?
look, he's not giving you any money, so piss off!
all right. Half a shekel for an old exleper? Did you say "exleper?"
sixteen years behind the bell, and proud of it, sir.
well, what happened? I were cured, sir.
cured? Yes, a bloody miracle, sir.
well, who cured you? Jesus did, sir.
I was hopping along, minding my own business.
all of a sudden, up he comes, cures me!
one minute, I'm a leper with a trade;
next minute, my livelihood's gone.
"you're cured, mate." Bloody dogooder.
well, why don't you go and tell him that you want to be a leper again?
I could do that, sir. Yeah, I could do that, I suppose.
I was gonna ask him if he'd make me a bit lame in one leg during the middle of the week.
you know, something beggable but not leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.
Brian! Come and clean your room out!
there you are. Thank you, sir. Thank
half a denary? Me bloody life story.
there's no pleasing some people.
that's just what Jesus said, sir.
Oh! Good afternoon.
Oh, uh, hello, officer.
I'll be with you in a few moments, all right, dear?
what's he doing here? Don't start that, Brian. Go and clean your room out.
bloody Romans! Now look, Brian.
if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have all this.
and don't you forget it. We don't owe the Romans anything, Mum.
well, that's not entirely true. What do you mean?
well, you know you were asking me about your my nose?
Yes. Well, there's a reason it's like it is, Brian.
what is it?
well, I suppose I should've told you a long time ago
what? Well, Brian...
your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
well, I never thought he was. None of your cheek!
he was a Roman, Brian.
he was a centurion in the Roman army.
you mean you were raped? Well, at first, yes.
who was it? Naughtius Maximus, his name was.
promised me the known world, he did.
I was to be taken to Rome, housed by the forum slaves, asses' milk, as much gold as I could eat.
then he, having his way with me, he had
vroom, like a rat out of an aqueduct! The bastard!
Yeah, so next time you go on about the bloody Romans, don't forget you're one of 'em!
I'm not a Roman, Mum! And I never will be!
I'm a kike, a Yid, a hebe, a hooknose!
I'm kosher, Mum! I'm a Red Sea pedestrian, and proud of it!
sex, sex, sex. That's all they think about, huh?
well, how are you, then, officer?
ladies and gentlemen, the next contest...
is between...
Frank Goliath, the Macedonian babycrusher, and Boris Mineburg.
Larks' tongues. Wren's livers.
chaffinch brains. Jaguars' earlobes.
wolf's nipple chips. Get 'em while they're hot. They're lovely.
dromedary pretzels, only half a denar. Tuscany fried bats.
I do feel, Reg, that any antilmperialist group like ours...
must reflect such a divergence of interest within its power base.
Oh, great. Francis? Yeah, I think Judith's point of view is very valid, Reg, provided the movement never forgets that it is the inalienable right of every man or woman.
or woman to rid himself
or herself. Or herself
agreed. Thank you, brother.
or sister. Or sister.
where was I?
I think you finished. Oh, right.
furthermore, it is the birthright of every man
or woman. Why don't you shut up about women?
women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement.
why are you always on about women, Stan?
I want to be one.
what? I want to be a woman.
from now on, I want you all to call me "Loretta."
what? It's my right as a man.
well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?
I want to have babies.
you want to have babies?
it's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.
but you can't have babies. Don't you oppress me.
I'm not oppressing you. You haven't got a womb.
where is the fetus gonna gestate?
you're gonna keep it in a box?
here, I've got an idea.
suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies, not having a womb which is nobody's fault, not even the Romans'
but that he can have the right to have babies?
good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors.......
for your right to have babies, brother
sister. Sorry. What's the point?
what? What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies...
when he can't have babies?
it is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.
symbolic of his struggle against reality.
it's dangerous out there.
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses. Ocelot spleens.
got any nuts? Haven't got any nuts. Sorry.
I've got wrens' livers, badger spleens. No, no, no.
otters' noses? I don't want that Roman rubbish!
why don't you sell proper food? Proper food?
Yeah, and not those rich, lmperialist tidbits.
well, don't blame me. I didn't ask to sell this stuff.
all right. Bag of otters' noses, then.
make it two. Thanks, Reg. Two.
are you the Judean People's Front? Fuck off!
what? Judean People's Front!
we're the People's Front of Judea!
Judean People's Front! Wankers.
can I join your group? No. Piss off.
I didn't want to sell this stuff. It's only a job.
I hate the Romans as much as anybody! Shhh. Shhh!
are you sure? Oh, dead sure. I hate the Romans.
listen, if you wanted to join the P. F.J. you'd have to really hate the Romans.
I do. Oh, yeah? How much?
a lot.
right. You're in.
listen. The only people we hate more than the Romans...
are the fuckin' Judean People's Front.
Yeah! Splitters!
and the Judean Popular People's Front. Oh, yeah! Splitters!
and the People's Front of Judea. Splitters!
what? The People's Front of Judea.
we're the People's Front of Judea!
Oh. I thought we were the Popular Front.
people's Front!
what happened to the Popular Front? He's over there.
Splitter!
Oh! I think I'm about to have a cardiac arrest.
absolutely dreadful.
brother! Haha! What's your name?
Brian. Brian Cohen.
we may have a little job for you, Brian.
what's this, then? "Romanes eunt domus"?
"people called Romanes, they go the house"?
lt says "Romans, go home."
no, it doesn't. What's Latin for "Roman"?
come on! "Romanes"?
goes like? "Annus"?
vocative plural of "annus" is? "Anni?"
Eunt"? What is "eunt"? "Go."
conjugate the verb "to go."
so "eunt" is?
third person plural, present indicative. "They go."
but "Romans, go home" is an order, so you must use the
the imperative. Which is?
um, oh, oh, "I."
how many Romans? Aah! Plural, plural.
"Domus"? Nominative?
"go home." This is motion towards, isn't it, Brian?
dative!
no, not dative!
accusative, accusative!
"Domum," sir. "Ad domum." Except when "domus" takes the locative, sir. Which is?
understand? Yes, sir.
now, write it out 100 times.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Hail Caesar, sir.
hail Caesar. If it's not done by sunrise, I'll cut your balls off.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. Hail Caesar and everything, sir.
finished!
right. Now, don't do it again.
Hey, bloody Romans!
we're gettin' in through the underground heating system here, up through into the main audience chamber here, and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.
having grabbed his wife, we inform Pilate that she is in our custody...
and forthwith issue our demands.
any questions? What exactly are the demands?
we're giving Pilate two days to dismantle...
the entire apparatus of the Roman lmperialist State, and if he doesn't agree immediately, we execute her.
cut her head off? Cut all her bits off.
send them back on the hour, every hour.
and, of course, we point out that they bear...
full responsibility when we chop her up...
and that we shall not submit to blackmail.
no blackmail!
they bled us white, the bastards. They've taken everything we had.
and not just from us. From our fathers and from our fathers' fathers.
and from our fathers' fathers' fathers. Yeah.
and from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers. Don't labor the point.
and what have they ever given us in return?
the aqueduct. What?
the aqueduct.
Oh, yeah, yeah. They did give us that.
and the sanitation.
Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg. Remember what the city used to be like.
Yeah, I'll grant you, the aqueduct and sanitation are two things the Romans have done.
and the roads. Well, obviously the roads.
I mean, the roads go without saying, don't they?
but apart from the sanitation, the aqueduct and the roads
irrigation. Medicine.
education. Yeah, all right. Fair enough.
and the wine.
Yeah, that's something we'd really miss, Reg, if the Romans left.
public baths. And it's safe to walk in the streets at night.
Yeah, they certainly keep order. They're the only ones who could in a place like this.
all right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?
brought peace. Oh, peace! Shut up!
I'm a poor man. My sight is poor.
my legs are old and bent.
it's all right, Matthias.
it's all clear.
well, where's Reg?
Oh, Reg. Reg, Judith.
what went wrong? The first blow has been struck.
did he finish the slogan? A hundred times, in letters ten foot high, all the way around the palace.
Oh, great. Great.
we We need doers in our movement, Brian, but before you join us, know this:
there is not one of us who would not gladly suffer death...
to rid this country of the Romans once and for all.
Oh, yeah, there's one.
but otherwise, we're solid. Are you with us?
Yes.
from now on you shall be called "Brian" that is called Brian.
tell him about the raid on Pilate's palace, Francis.
right. This is the plan.
now, this is the palace on Caesar's Square.
our commando unit will approach from Fish Street under cover of night...
and make our way to the northwestern main drain.
if questioned, we are sewage workers on our way to a conference.
Reg, our glorious leader and founder of the P. F.J. will be coordinating consultant at the drain head, though he himself will not be taking part in any terrorist action...
as he has a bad back.
aren't you going to come with us? Solidarity, brother.
Oh, yes, solidarity, Reg.
once in the sewer, timing will be of the essence.
there is a Roman feast later in the evening, so you must move fast.
and don't wear your best sandals.
turning left here, we enter the CaesarAugustus memorial sewer, and from there proceed directly to the hypocaust.
this has just been retiled. So, terrorists, careful with those weapons.
we will now be directly beneath Pilate's audience chamber itself.
this is the moment for Habbakuk to get out his prong.
Shhh. Shhh.
campaign for Free Galilee.
Oh, uh, People's Front of Judea. Officials.
Oh. What's your group doing here?
we're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife, take her back, issue demands.
so are we. That's our plan. What?
we were here first. What do you mean?
we thought of it first. We did!
Yes, a couple of years ago. We did!
come on. You got all your demands worked out, then?
of course we have. What are they?
well, I'm not telling you. Oh, come on!
that's not the point. We thought of it before you.
did not! We did!
you bastards, we've been planning this for months.
well, tough pity for you, Fish Face. Oh!
brothers, we should be struggling together.
we mustn't fight each other.
surely, we should be united against the common enemy.
the Judean People's Front!
no, no, the Romans!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he's right.
right. Where were we? You were gonna punch me.
brothers!
what
you lucky bastard.
who's that?
you lucky, lucky bastard.
what? Quite the little jailer's pet, are we?
what do you mean? You must've slipped him a few shekels.
slipped him a few shekels? You saw him spit in my face.
Oh, what wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face!
I sometimes hang awake at night dreaming of being spat at in the face.
well, it's not exactly friendly. They have me in manacles.
manacles?
my idea of heaven is to be allowed to be put in manacles...
just for a few hours.
they must think the sun shines out of your ass, son.
Oh, lay off me! I've had a hard time!
you've had a hard time? I've been here five years.
they only hung me the right way up yesterday, so don't you
all right, all right.
they must think you're Lord God Almighty.
what will they do to me? Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion.
crucifixion? Yeah, first offense.
get away with crucifixion? It's
best thing the Romans ever did for us. What?
Oh, yeah, if we didn't have crucifixion, this country'd be in a bloody mess.
guard! Nail him up, I say!
guard! Nail some sense into him!
what do you want?
I want you to move me to another cell.
Aah! Oh, look at that! Bloody favoritism.
shut up, you! Sorry.
now take my case. They hung me up here five years ago.
every night, they take me down for 20 minutes, then they hang me up again, which I regard as very fair in view of what I've done.
and if nothing else, it's taught me to respect the Romans, and it's taught me that you'll never get anywhere in this life...
unless you're prepared to do a fair day's work for a fair day's
Oh, shut up!
here. Pilate wants to see you.
me? Come on!
Pilate? What's he want to see me for?
I think he wants to know which way up you want to be crucified.
nice one, centurion. Like it.
shut up! Right, right.
terrific race, the Romans. Terrific!
hail Caesar. Hail.
only one survivor, sir. Oh. "Throw" him to the floor.
what's that? Throw him to the floor.
Oh.
now, what is your name, Jew?
Brian, sir. "Bwian," eh?
no, no. Brian.
Aah!
the little rascal has "spiwit."
has what, sir? "Spiwit."
Yes, he did, sir.
no, no. "Spiwit," "bwavado," a touch of "dewwingdo."
Oh, uh, about 11, sir.
so, you dare to "waid" us?
to what, sir?
"Stwike" him, centurion, very "woughly."
Aah! And "thwow" him to the floor, sir?
what? "Thwow" him to the floor again, sir?
Oh, yes, "thwow" him to the floor, please.
Aah! Now, Jewish "wapscallion"
I'm not Jewish. I'm a Roman.
a "Woman"? No, no. Roman.
Aah!
so, your father was a "woman." Who was he?
he was a centurion in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.
Really? What was his name?
Naughtius Maximus.
centurion, do you have anyone of that name in the garrison?
well, no, sir.
well, you sound very sure. Have you checked?
well, no, sir. I think it's a joke, sir.
like, uh, "Sillius Soddus" or "Biggus Dickus," sir.
what's funny about "Biggus Dickus"?
well, it's a joke name, sir.
I have a very great friend in Rome called Biggus Dickus.
Silence! What is all this insolence?
you will find yourself in gladiator school "vewy" quickly...
with "wotten" behavior like that.
can I go now, sir? Aaah!
wait till Biggus Dickus hears of this.
"Wight!" Take him away!
Oh, sir, he I want him fighting wild, "wabid" animals within a week.
Yes, sir. Come on, you.
I will not have my friends "widiculed" by the common "soldiewy."
anyone else feel like a little giggle...
when I mention my "fwiend,"
Biggus...
Dickus?
what about you? Do you find it "wisible..."
when I say the name...
Biggus... Dickus?
he has a wife, you know?
you know what she's called?
she's called "Incontinentia."
Incontinentia buttocks.
shut up! What is all this?
I've had enough of this "wowdy," "webel" behavior!
Silence! Quiet! "Pwaetowian" guards!
seize him! Seize him! Blow your noses and seize him!
hmm? Hmm.
Oh, you lucky bastard.
and the Bezan shall be huge and black...
and the eyes thereof red with the blood of living creatures!
and the whore of Babylon...
shall ride forth on a threeheaded serpent!
and throughout the lands there'll be a great rubbing of parts.
the demon shall bear a ninebladed sword.
ninebladed not two or five or seven, but nine which he will wield on all wretched sinners, just like you, sir, there.
and the whoring shall be on the head of Addius.
there shall in that time be rumors of things going astray, um, and there shall be a great confusion as to where things really are.
and nobody will really know where lieth...
those little things...
with the sort of raffia work base that has an attachment.
at this time, a friend shall lose his friend's hammer, and the young shall not know where lieth...
the things possessed by their fathers...
that their fathers put there only just the night before about 8: 00.
yea, it is written in the Book of Cyril...
in that time
how much, quick? It's for the wife.
Oh, uh, 20 shekels. Right.
what? There you are.
wait a minute. What?
we're supposed to haggle. No, no, no. I've got to get
what do you mean, no? I haven't got time.
well, give it back, then. No, no. I just paid you.
Burt, this bloke won't haggle. Won't haggle?
all right. Do we have to?
I want 20 for that. I just gave you 20.
are you telling me that's not worth 20 shekels? No.
feel the quality. That's none of your goat. I'll give you 19, then.
no, no, no. Do it properly. What?
haggle properly. This isn't worth 19. You just said it was worth 20.
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Come on, haggle.
all right, I'll give you ten. That's more like it.
ten? Are you trying to insult me?
me with a poor, dying grandmother? Ten?
all right, I'll give you 11. Now you're gettin' it.
did I hear you right? Eleven? This cost me 12. You want to ruin me?
Seventeen? No, no, no, no. Seventeen.
eighteen. No, no. You go to 14 now.
all right, I'll give you 14. Fourteen? Are you joking?
that's what you told me to say! Oh, dear.
Oh, tell me what to say, please!
offer me 14. I'll give you 14.
he's offering me 14 for this! Fifteen!
seventeen. My last word. I won't take a penny less, or strike me dead.
sixteen. Done.
nice to do business with you.
I'll throw you in this as well. I don't want it, but thanks.
Burt. All right, all right.
now, where's the 16 you owe me? I just gave you 20.
right. That's four I owe you, then. That's right. That's fine.
I've got it here somewhere. That's four for the gourd.
four? For this gourd?
look at it! It's worth ten if it's worth a shekel.
you gave it to me for nothing. Yes, but it's worth ten.
all right, all right.
no, no, no, no. It's not worth ten.
you're supposed to argue. "Ten for that? You must be mad."
Oh, well. One born every minute.
Daniel. Daniel.
job. Job.
Joshua. Joshua.
judges. Judges.
and Brian. And Brian.
I now propose that all seven of these exbrothers...
be now entered in the minutes as probationary martyrs to the cause.
I second that, Reg. Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.
siblings, let us not be down on it.
one total catastrophe like this...
is just the beginning!
their glorious deaths shall unite us all in
look out!
Hello?
Matthias?
Reg? Go away.
Reg, it's me, Brian.
get off! Get off out of it!
Stan! Piss off.
Yeah, piss off. Bugger off.
Oh, shit!
coming.
yea, verily at that time it is written in the book of Obadiah, a man shall strike his donkey and his nephew's donkey.
my eyes are dim. I cannot see.
are you Matthias? Yes.
we have reason to believe you may be hiding one Brian of Nazareth, a member of the terrorist organization, the People's Front of Judea.
me? No. I'm just a poor old man.
I have no time for lawbreakers.
my legs are grey. My ears are nulled.
my eyes are old and bent.
quiet! Silly person.
guards, search the house.
you know the penalty laid down by Roman law...
for harboring a known criminal?
no. Crucifixion.
Oh.
nasty, eh? Could be worse.
what do you mean, "Could be worse?"
well, you could be stabbed.
stabbed? Takes a second. Crucifixion lasts hours.
it's a slow, horrible death.
well, at least it gets you out in the open air.
you're weird.
no, sir. Couldn't find anything, sir.
well, don't worry. You've not seen the last of us, weirdo.
big Nose. Watch it!
whew, that was lucky.
I'm sorry, Reg.
Oh, it's all right. He's sorry.
he's sorry he led the Fifth Legion straight to our headquarters.
well, that's all right, then, Brian. Sit down.
have a scone. Make yourself at home. You klutz!
you stupid, birdbrained, flatheaded
my legs are old and bent.
my ears are grizzled. Yes?
there's one place we didn't look. Guards!
I'm just a poor old man.
my nose is knackered.
have you ever seen anyone crucified?
Crucifixion's a doddle.
don't keep saying that.
found this spoon, sir.
well done, sergeant.
we'll be back, oddball.
open up!
you haven't given us time to hide.
in that time the serpent, he shall strike you
holes from every bitch you got germs from jumbo jets
don't pass judgement on other people...
or you might get judged yourself.
what? I said, don't pass judgement on other people...
or else you might get judged too.
who, me? Yes.
thank you very much. Not just you. All of you.
that's a nice gourd. What?
how much do you want for the gourd? You can have it.
have it? Yes. Consider the lilies.
don't you want to haggle? No. In the field.
what's wrong with it? Nothing. Take it.
consider the lilies? Well, the birds, then.
what birds? Any birds.
Why? Well, have they got jobs?
who? The birds.
have the birds got jobs?
what's the matter with him? Says the birds are scrounging.
the point is, the birds, they do all right, don't they?
well, good luck to 'em. Yeah, they're very pretty.
okay. And you're much more important than they are, right?
so what are you worrying about? There you are. See?
I'm worrying about what you've got against birds.
I haven't got anything against the birds.
consider the lilies. He's having a go at the flowers now!
give the flowers a chance. I'll give you one for it.
it's yours. Two, then.
look, there was this man, and he had two servants.
what were they called? What were their names?
I don't know. And he gave them some talents.
you don't know? Well, it doesn't matter.
he doesn't know what they were called!
they were called Simon and Adrian. You said you didn't know!
it really doesn't matter. The point is, there were these two servants.
he's making it up as he goes along. No, I'm not!
and he gave them wait, were there three?
Oh, he's terrible.
there were two or three. Oh, get off!
now hear this! Blessed are they...
three. Who convert their neighbor's asses.
for they shall inhibit their girth. Rubbish!
and to them only shall be given to them only shall be given what? Hmm?
shall be given what? Oh, nothing.
what were you going to say? Nothing.
Yes, you were going to say something. No, I finished.
tell us before you go. I'm finished.
no, you don't. Why won't he tell?
won't say! It ain't a secret, is it?
must be, otherwise he'd tell us. Tell us.
leave me alone. What is the secret?
is it the secret of eternal life? He won't say.
if I knew the secret of eternal life, I wouldn't say.
leave me alone! Just tell me, please.
we were here first.
go away! Tell us, master.
is that his gourd? Yeah, but it's under offer.
this is his gourd.
ten! It is his gourd!
we will carry it for you, master.
master? He's gone!
he's been taken up.
he's been taken up!
nineteen! No, there he is. Over there.
look! Oh! Oh!
he has given us a sign.
he has given us his shoe!
the shoe is the sign. Let us follow his example.
what? Let us, like him, hold up one shoe!
for this is his sign that all who follow him shall do likewise!
Yes! No, no. The shoe is a sign...
that we must gather shoes together in abundance.
cast off the shoes. Follow the gourd!
no, let us gather shoes together! Let me!
no, it is a sign that, like him, we must think not of the things of the body...
but of the face and head.
give me your shoe! Get off!
follow the gourd, the Holy Gourd of Jerusalem!
the gourd! Hold up the sandal, as he has commanded us.
it is a shoe! It's a sandal!
no, it isn't! Cast it away!
put it on! Clear off!
take the shoes and follow him!
come back! Stop!
let us let us pray.
yea, he comes to us...
like the seeds of the grain.
master! Master!
Hey! Is there another way down?
is there another path down to the river?
please, please help me. I've got to get
Oh, my foot! Oh
Shhh. Oh, damn, damn, damn!
I'm sorry. Oh, damn, damn it! Blast it!
I'm sorry. Shhh. Don't you "shhh" me.
eighteen years of total silence, and you "shhh" me!
what? I've kept my vow for 18 years...
not a single, recognizable, articulate sound has passed my lips.
could you be quiet for another five minutes?
it doesn't matter now. I might as well enjoy myself.
for the last 18 years, I've wanted to shout...
and sing and scream my name out!
Shhh. Shhh. Oh, I'm alive!
hava nagila, hava nagila
hava nagila
Oh, I'm alive! I'm alive! Hello, birds. Hello, trees.
I'm alive! I'm alive!
hava nagila. Hava n'ra, n'ra
master! Master! Master!
master! The master! He is here!
his shoe led us to him!
speak! Speak to us, master. Speak to us!
go away!
a blessing! A blessing!
how shall we go away, master?
Oh, just go away and leave me alone!
give us a sign!
he has given us a sign! He has brought us to this place!
I didn't bring you here. You just followed me.
Oh, it's still a good sign by any standard.
master, your people have walked many miles to be with you!
they are weary and have not eaten.
it's not my fault they haven't eaten.
there is no food in this high mountain!
what about the juniper bushes over there?
a miracle! A miracle!
he has made the bush fruitful by his words!
they've brought forth juniper berries.
of course! They're juniper bushes! What do you expect!
show us another miracle.
do not tempt him, shallow ones!
is not the miracle of the juniper bushes enough?
I say, those are my juniper bushes!
they are a gift from God. They're all I've got to eat.
I say, get off those bushes. Go on. Clear off.
Lord, I am affected by a bald patch.
I'm healed! The master has healed me!
I didn't touch him!
I was blind, and now I can see!
a miracle! A miracle!
tell them to stop it.
I hadn't said a word for 18 years till he came along.
a miracle! He is the Messiah!
he hurt my foot!
hurt my foot! Hurt mine!
hail Messiah! I'm not the Messiah.
I say you are, Lord, and I should know. I've followed a few.
hail Messiah!
I'm not the Messiah! Will you please listen?
I'm not the Messiah! Do you understand? Honestly!
only the true Messiah denies his divinity.
what? Well, what sort of chance does that give me?
all right, I am the Messiah!
he is! He is the Messiah!
now, fuck off!
how shall we fuck off, O Lord?
just leave me alone!
you told these people to eat my juniper berries!
you break my bloody foot, you break my vow of silence...
and then you try to clean up on my juniper bushes!
lay off! This is the Messiah, the Chosen One!
no, he's not. An unbeliever!
an unbeliever! Persecute. Kill the heretic!
seize him! Leave him alone!
leave him alone!
leave him alone.
let him go! Please!
Brian? Judith?
Cockadoodledoo!
look! There he is! The Chosen One has woken!
Brian!
Brian! Hang on, Mother!
Shhh.
Hello, Mother. Don't you "Hello, Mother" me!
what are all those people doing out there?
well, I Come on. What have you been up to?
I think they must have popped by for something.
popped by? Swarmed by, more like.
there's a multitude out there!
they started following me yesterday.
well, they can stop following you right now.
now, stop following my son!
you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
the Messiah! The Messiah! Show us the Messiah!
the who? The Messiah!
there's no messiah in here.
there's a mess, all right, but no messiah. Now, go away.
Brian! Brian!
right, my lad. What have you been up to?
nothing, Mum. Come on, out with it.
well, they think I'm the Messiah, Mum.
what have you been telling them?
nothing. I only You're only making it worse for yourself.
I can explain. Let me explain, Mrs. Cohen!
your son is a born leader.
those people out there are following him because they believe in him.
they believe he can give them hope, hope of a new life, a new world, a better future!
who's that?
that's Judith, Mum. Judith, Mother.
hmm. Aaah!
Ohhh! Messiah! Messiah! Messiah!
Messiah! Show us the Messiah!
now, you listen here. He's not the Messiah!
he's a very naughty boy. Now, go away!
who are you? I'm his mother, that's who.
behold his mother! Behold his mother!
hail to thee, mother of Brian!
blessed art thou! Hosanna!
all praise to thee, now and always!
well, now don't think you can get around me like that.
he's not coming out, and that's my final word.
now, shove off! No!
did you hear what I said? Yes!
Oh, I see. It's like that, is it?
Yes! Oh, all right, then.
you can see him for one minute, but not one second more!
do you understand? Yes.
promise? Well... all right.
all right, here he is, then. Come on, Brian. Come and talk.
but, Mum, Judith. Oh, leave that Welsh tart alone.
I don't really want to.
Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian!
good morning. A blessing! A blessing!
no, no. Please. Please, please listen.
I've got one or two things to say.
tell us! Tell us both of them!
look, you've got it all wrong.
you don't need to follow me.
you don't need to follow anybody.
you've got to think for yourselves.
you're all individuals.
Yes, we're all individuals!
you're all different.
Yes, we're all different!
I'm not. Shhh.
you've all got to work it out for yourselves.
Yes, we've got to work it out for ourselves!
exactly.
tell us more!
No! That's the point! Don't let anyone tell you what to do!
otherwise Ow!
that's enough. That's enough.
Ooh, that wasn't a minute!
Oh, yes it was! Oh, no it wasn't!
now, stop that! And go away!
excuse me? Yes?
are you a virgin? I beg your pardon!
well, if it's not a personal question, are you a virgin?
if it's not a personal question?
how much more personal can you get?
now, piss off!
she is. Yeah, definitely.
morning, Savior.
lay your hands on me, quick!
now, don't jostle the Chosen One, please.
don't push that baby in the Savior's face.
I say, could you just see my wife?
you'll have to wait, I'm afraid.
we've got a luncheon appointment.
the lepers are queuing.
my brotheronlaw is the exmayor of Gath!
Brian, can I introduce the gentleman who's letting us have the Mounts on Sunday?
don't push! And keep the noise down!
those possessed by devils, try and keep them under control.
incurables, you'll just have to wait for a few minutes.
um, women taken in sin, line up against that wall, will you?
Brian? Brian, you were fantastic.
you weren't so bad yourself.
no. What you said just now. It was quite extraordinary.
what? All that, was it?
we don't any leaders. You're so right.
reg has been dominating us for too long. Well, yes.
it needed saying, and you said it, Brian. You're very attractive.
it's our revolution. We can all do it together.
I think. I think We're all behind you, Brian.
the revolution is in your hands! What?
no, that's not what I meant at all!
you're fuckin' nicked, me old beauty.
right.
stop it.
well, "Bwian," you've given us a good "wun" for our money, what?
but this time, I "guawantee" you will not escape.
guard, do we have any "cwucifixions" today?
139, sir. Special celebration. Passover, sir.
right. Now we have 140. Nice, round number, eh, Biggus?
hail Caesar!
hail. The crowd outside getting restless.
permission to disperse them, please.
disperse them? I haven't addressed them yet.
I know, sir, but
my "addwess" is one of the high points of the Passover.
my "fwiend" Biggus Dickus has come all the way from "Wome."
hail Caesar. Hail "Thaesar,"
you're not
are you not thinking of giving it a miss this year, then, sir?
give it a miss?
well, it's just that they're in a rather funny mood today, sir.
"Weally," "centuwion," I'm "surpwised" to hear a man like you...
"Wattled" by a "wabble" of "wowdy" "webels."
uh, a bit thundery, sir. Take him away.
I'm a Roman! II can prove it! Honestly!
and "cwucify" him well. Yes.
Biggus.
il really wouldn't, sir. Out of the way, "centuwion."
let me come with you, Pontius.
I may be of "thome" "athistance" if there is a "thudden" "crithis."
right. Now item four: Attainment of world supremacy within the next five years.
uh, Francis, you've been doing some work on this? Yeah. Thank you, Reg.
well, quite frankly, siblings, I think five years is optimistic...
unless we can smash the Roman Empire within the next 12 months.
twelve months, yeah? Twelve months.
and let's face it, as empires go, this is the big one, so we gotta get up off our asses and stop just talkin' about it.
hear! Hear! It's action that counts, not words.
and we need action now! Hear! Hear!
you're right. We could sit around here all day, talkin', passin' resolutions, makin' clever speeches.
it's not gonna shift one Roman soldier!
so let's just stop gabbin' on about it. It's completely pointless.
and it's gettin' us nowhere. Right!
I agree. This is a complete waste of time.
they've arrested Brian! What? What?
they dragged him off! They want to crucify him!
right! This calls for immediate discussion!
what? Immediate!
right. New motion?
completely new motion. Uh, that, uh, that there be immediate action
once the vote has been taken. Obviously once the vote's been taken.
you can't act on a resolution till you've voted on it. Reg, let's go now, please!
right! In the light of fresh information from Sibling Judith. Not so fast, Reg.
Reg, for God's sake! It's perfectly simple.
all you've got to do is to go out of that door now...
and try to stop the Romans nailing him up!
it's happening, Reg! Something's actually happening, Reg!
can't you understand?

to you, Brian, on this, the occasion of your martyrdom.

cheer up, Brian. You know what they say.
some things in life are bad.
they can really make you mad.
other things just make you swear and curse.
when you're chewing on life's gristle
don't grumble Give a whistle
and this'll help things turn out for the best
and
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the light side of life
if life seems jolly rotten there's something you've forgotten
and that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
when you're feeling in the dumps
don't be silly chumps
just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
and always look on the bright side of life
always look on the bright side of life
for life is quite absurd
and death's the final word
you must always face the curtain with a bow
forget about your sin
give the audience a grin
enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow
so always look on the bright side of death
just before you draw your terminal breath
life's a piece of shit when you look at it
life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
you'll see it's all a show People laughing as you go
just remember that the last laugh is on you
and always look on the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
come on, Brian. Cheer up.
always look on the bright side of life
always look on the right side of life
worse things happen at sea, you know?
always look on the bright side of life

as we say farewell to our friend Sam Wheat we are reminded of his kindness...his generosity his buoyancy of spirit.
all that we treasure our loved ones our friends our body our mind are but on loan to us. We must surrender them all.

as our loved one enters eternal life let us remember that love too is eternal.
that although we will miss him our love will light the void and dispel the darkness.
