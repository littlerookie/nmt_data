my brother couldn't survive without me.
Lucas? Lucas, I have to go to the bathroom.
I have to, you know, pee.
Oh, well...
there's a bucket. - No, I can't. Not in a bucket.
there's a bucket.
Lucas, that's ok for all of you boys, but I'm a girl. I need privacy.
you have to let me go outside.
but there's a bucket.
it's ok. We're friends. - Friend?
OK. - Ok.
anything else? - Nothing that'll help find his brother.
there's that cell phone he calls dozens of times a day, but that appears to be off.
and I tried to activate the GPS locator on it, but I think it's an old phone, - so that's not gonna work either. - Will you know if it comes on?
I hope so.
keep at it. - Yes, sir.
OK, I--I can go from here.
go? - No, I'm not leaving, Lucas.
I just need some privacy.
you wait over there, Lucas... By the door.
it'll be all right.
it's ok. It's ok.
further.
further.
further.
Hey, how's it going? - Just waiting for
Oh, my god. The phone just turned back on.
what? No.
almost done. Stay there, Lucas.
Kelly! - Oh, my god. Agent Rossi, the phone is calling in!
Hello? Hello? My name is Kelly.
Kelly, this is Penelope Garcia. I'm with the FBI.
Oh, my god, you have to help me.
I'm somewhere in the woods being held by a man named Lucas...
and he's--oh, my god! - That's mine!
help me!
the phone's disconnected. - Garcia, can you find the signal?
no, I--wait. Yes. I'm hooked into the system.
I should be able to-- got it.
it's just west of here, less than half a mile.
that's all you can tell?
it's in the woods. There aren't any reference points.
take the coordinates to my GPS and let Morgan and Prentiss know in the field.
Dave, Reid, let's go.
mommy, don't! The FBI is coming!
Mason says everyone always lies! Always!
you lied! Always-- - Let me go, you freak!
almost there. A couple hundred yards.
should be right here.
not a freak.
Lucas. Lucas, I'm sorry.
should be right here.
this is where the signal came from.
there's nothing here.
I--I pushed him.
I pushed him. - Lucas.
I--I pushed him off the barn. It was me. I did it.
sometimes I get so mad I get bad mad.
Lucas, you don't have to.
bad, bad mad.
we're in exactly the right spot.
all right, everybody split up. - Kelly!
guys. - Kelly!
I'm a freak.
Lucas, you are not a freak.
I'm a freak.
go ahead. Kelly Shane?
down here!
don't make any sudden moves when they come down, ok?
I'm bad. I'm bad.
Lucas Turner, this is the FBI.
just put your hands up, ok?
sometimes there are no words, no clever quotes to neatly sum up what's happened that day.
sometimes you do everything right, everything exactly right, and still you feel like you've failed.
did it need to end that way?
could something have been done to prevent the tragedy in the first place?
89 murders at the pig farm.
the deaths of Mason and Lucas Turner make 91 lives snuffed out.
Kelly Shane will go home and try to recover, to reconnect with her family, but she'll never be a child again.
william Hightower, who gave his leg for his country, gave the rest of himself to avenge his sister's murder.
that makes 93 lives forever altered, not counting family and friends in a small town in Sarnia, Ontario, who thought monsters didn't exist until they learned that they spent their lives with one.
and what about my team?
how many more times will they be able to look into the abyss?
how many more times before they won't ever recover the pieces of themselves that this job takes?
like I said, sometimes there are no words, no clever quotes to neatly sum up what's happened that day.
you should have made a deal.
sometimes the day just...
ends.
dead female. Knife wound to the chest.
sexual assault gone wrong we think.
is she dead?
it looks like I killed her.
that's how it looks.
maybe you didn't mean to.
sometimes stuff just happens.
you plead guilty to manslaughter, and there will be no murder trial.
what would you do?
if I were you,
I'd ask myself one question.
did I kill her?
do you plead guilty or not guilty?
not guilty.
Ben, I should be working this case.
some cases need dogs with low bellies and good noses.
that's me.
all right.
the whole wing knows about Ben Coulter, rapist, murderer.
I didn't do this.
do you believe me?
no-one on the wing believes you.
is there anything else?
Yeah. Milroy...he won't go away.
do you want Freddie Graham to help you?
or do you prefer dead in the shower with your guts cut out and your smart brains all over the floor?
just play the game, Ben.
just play the game.
he said five deliveries.
that's the last one.
mr Graham's very grateful for all the hard work you've been putting in over the last few weeks.
your work's done, featherweight.
out of all the barristers they could have given me!
the clerks know you don't like Alison Slaughter.
you'd never have said yes if they'd choose her put her up for this.
so, they tell you you can have the head of chambers, knowing that you can't do it. Then the day before the trial...
I'm gutted, Mr Stone. He's gutted, Mr Stone.
last minute Court of Appeal thing. We're all gutted.
but Alison Slaughter's free.
Yeah, what choice do I have so late in the day?
OK, manslaughter's gone.
we're in the house. We don't have much option about that.
but we didn't murder her. No.
so, she attacked us, we defended ourselves, she died. Simple.
we haven't discussed self-defence.
first thing I look for when I get a brief second-hand.
is there a bullshit defence I'm stuck with?
it's to your credit that our instructions from Mr Coulter are so completely useless.
forensics?
damning. Ours?
I've had preliminary, off-the-record chats...
basically, our man put the knife in her.
Self-defence... only option. Tell me about Melanie.
bit wild, I think.
in a normal way.
good. Troubled, possibly, I don't know.
I want "a bit wild and "troubled possibly" turned into off her trolley and dangerous.
I'm done here. Mr Stone's been very helpful.
I'm out to lunch.
I'm a solicitor.
not the police force. How am I supposed to find all this?
I've given you the picture I want. Go and do the colouring in.
bring me Melanie the nutter.
I'm not very good with funerals. I'm just going to...
I'm going to stay outside, if that's all right.
I don't know what you think you're doing here, but if you go near that family,
I'll finish your career.
I've got a job to do, Box. Just like you.
what did you say? We're both working, aren't we?
I'm looking after the family of a murder victim.
making sure they know that they have my support.
like I said.
working.
better by far you should forget and smile,
than that you should remember and be sad.
beautiful, isn't it?
I do love Rossetti.
I'm Lizzie.
hello.
we haven't met before. No.
were you a close friend of Melanie?
here's my card.
who are you?
Melanie's death, it's not straight forward as people think.
call me.
wakey, wakey, boys and girls.
lovely day.
rise and shine.
today's the day, Sunbeam.
it's a long time you're in the dock.
the jury will try and avoid looking at you most of the time.
they'll...
they'll sneak little looks, of course, cos you're a murderer.
how you're looking, what you're doing, it really, really matters.
don't for a second lose concentration.
don't get caught looking wrong.
Thanks, Hooch.
shopping.
from Mr Graham.
there's one thing Freddie Graham's terrified of.
boredom.
you're that rare thing. A lad in prison with half a brain.
he can't resist you.
my mum already sent in a shirt.
I know your mum.
Mary.
she's a decent woman.
Oh, yes.
she'll do her best for her son.
but she doesn't know juries.
she'll put you in something nice.
something wedding nice.
it won't be a jury shirt.
I already have a shirt.
thank you.
that's not a jury shirt. Here.
take it off and put this one on.
Where's the barrister? Take your shirt off.
is she good? Put it this way.
if I'd known she was available,
I would have asked for Alison Slaughter from the off.
Ben Coulter? Hello.
you're a vacuum. I love a vacuum.
what?
you have been no help whatsoever to anyone on the question of how Melanie Lloyd got a fatal knife wound to the heart.
which is splendid, because I get to fill the vacuum and you will tell me that I'm right.
we're running self-defence.
she's a highly-sexed predatory and disturbed woman.
by the time I've finished with Melanie Lloyd, the jury will have her down as borderline satanic.
agreed, Mr Stone? Yeah.
we have an advantage here on account of her being dead.
she can't contradict anything we say about her.
can I have some time?
we're in court in 3 minutes. I need focus and clarity.
she liked knives.
she lured you into her nutty world, she messed around with your head, she tried to kill you, you defended yourself, she died.
that's what we're running.
but that's not... No buts.
it's the only defence available to us.
and it just happens to be the defence which will win us the trial and give you your life back.
so, unless you're very stupid,
I'm pretty sure you're going to remember things the way I'm telling it.
I'll see you upstairs.
we're running self-defence on the back of she was out to lunch.
has he agreed to that? Not yet.
we have to have instructions, don't we? We can't just make it up.
he likes you, doesn't he?
so squeeze his little pips.
help him to remember what we want him to remember.
is that ethical? I beg your pardon?
sorry.
she's saying self-defence.
it could be true.
it could be how it happened and you've blanked it.
it's not uncommon.
I'd be saying that I killed her.
you'd be saying you caused her death.
that you were in fear for your own life and had no choice.
what you did would be...
was... reasonable in the circumstances.
my mum and dad will be in court.
mum. Dad.
you do need to tell us, Ben.
you need to say yes to self-defence.
you told me I shouldn't admit to anything I couldn't remember doing.
all we have to do is raise the possibility of self-defence in court.
then it's for the other side to prove that it wasn't.
one nod from you and the prosecution has to work very hard to disprove you weren't defending yourself.
self-defence is your only way out.
he's nearly there. Nearly's no good.
he needs a bit longer.
all parties in Coulter to Court One.
let's buy some time.
how?
M'Lady, now that the jury are in could they be sent out again, please?
is she dead?" The question my client is alleged to have asked in the back of the police car as it approached the murder scene is very damaging.
I agree.
if it was said, it shouldn't have been.
you could do without it, Ms Slaughter.
and the jury should not be permitted to hear something so prejudicial in evidence.
because you don't like it?
is there a new category of inadmissible evidence which is called the defence don't like it because it makes the defendant look guilty?
pace says that all interviews should be conducted at the police station so that they can be tape recorded, a solicitor can be present and the police are protected from their own tendency to make things up.
mr Painter.
he just said it.
it wasn't prompted by anything. If it had been said as the result of a question asked in the police car by a police officer, then it would be quite wrong and wholly inadmissible, because questions must be put in recorded interview at the police station, with a solicitor present...
so the police can be protected from the tendency of criminals to make things up.
I said it.
the jury will hate it. We don't want them to hear it.
but I said it. It's the truth.
it's irrelevant.
would M'Lady give me one moment with the defendant? No.
you've had all the time you need.
my ruling is that this evidence is admissible.
the jury will hear it.
this is a vicious, cold-blooded murder.
a young girl knifed to death by a callous killer who made every attempt to hide the evidence of the brutal crime he had committed.
some of what you are going to hear and see is very upsetting.
murder is murder, and, invariably, it's ugly.
he paid for petrol. He got back into the black cab, and they drove away.
time's up. This is it.
I can't cross-examine anyone without your instructions.
so I need you to look me in the eye right now and tell me that I'm right.
she attacked you. You defended yourself. She died.
yes?
am I wrong? Tell me I'm wrong.
that's good enough. Let's go.
in your witness statement you say that Melanie threw a cigarette butt out of the cab window at the petrol station, is that correct? Yes.
reckless and dangerous, don't you think?
Where's this going, Ms Slaughter?
it's a pretty crazy thing to do.
I'm going to warn you now.
we have joined up cross examination in my court.
no lobbing hand grenades and ducking, Ms Slaughter.
I then arrested Ben Coulter for the murder of Melanie Lloyd and cautioned him.
how did his demeanour strike you?
jumpy.
nervous.
is this your first murder trial?
Yes, M'Lady.
is this your first time in the witness box?
Yes, M'Lady.
are you going to address all your answers to the judge?
Yes, M'Lady.
and are you going to read all your evidence from your notebook?
the answer to my question about your notebook is unlikely to be in your notebook.
it's supposed to be a way of refreshing your memory, not a replacement for it.
unless of course you've completely forgotten all about your...
first ever murder?
no, M'Lady.
who told you to address all your answers to the judge?
my boss.
detective Superintendent Box.
in what other ways did Detective Superintendent Box coach you on witness box performance?
I don't want to say.
Oh, come on, Officer.
the jury is dying to hear what supposedly independent police witnesses are told to say by their superiors.
I made a note. Well, you may refer to your notebook.
he said...
watch out for their QC making unsubstantiated
and generalised slurs on your character borne out of the desperation "which comes when a brief knows the defence is completely hopeless.
you asked the question, Ms Slaughter.
carefully prepared as you are, Officer, you'll be expecting me to cross-examine you on the verbal in the police car.
is she dead?
it would be surprising if you didn't.
why does what he the defendant said in the car make him more likely to be guilty of murder?
he couldn't have known there was a body unless he was in the house.
doesn't make him a murderer, though, does it?
it just puts him at the scene.
were you in the house when Melanie Lloyd died?
no.
so you can't help us with what went on inside the house in the time leading up to her death.
no.
you're in no position to contradict me when I tell you that Melanie Lloyd died as a result of
Ben Coulter defending himself from her.
Melanie Lloyd is dead.
we all feel deeply sorry about that fact.
but during this trial we're going to hear about some very different aspects of her character.
she was wild and she was dangerous.
and she went for him.
questions, not speeches,
ms Slaughter.
is she dead?
does that sound to you like the utterance of a cold-blooded killer?
Where's the sang froid in a remark like that?
english only, thank you.
how long was it from the 999 call made by the neighbour
as he watched the defendant drive away from the murder scene
to our arrival at the scene of the crashed taxi?
I'm sure you're going to tell us, Officer.
three minutes and 26 seconds. To get from the murder scene to...
where he crashed the taxi in such a short time he must have been driving at 60 mph, in a black cab.
only, what, four minutes or so after leaving the dead body?
what were you doing four minutes after your first sight of Melanie's body?
you were throwing up in the boot of a police car. Why?
it was just how I reacted.
is it how you hoped you'd react when put in a situation like this?
no. Is it what your training told you to do?
was it the action of a clear thinking man?
or was it the response of a normal human being to a horrible scene?
none of us know how we'll react in extremes, do we, officer?
very few of us have grace under pressure.
that's right.
close proximity to violent death makes people behave deeply unpredictably.
it would be foolish of us to conclude from your being sick that you are an unprofessional police officer.
just as it would be foolish of us to conclude from the fact that because you're a junior police officer, you don't speak French.
and it would be incredibly foolish of us to think that the behaviour of Ben Coulter immediately after the death of this poor young girl makes him a murderer.
some people panic, lose their heads and run away.
other people throw up in the boots of police cars.
Ben Coulter was there when Melanie Lloyd received her fatal knife wound.
he was responsible for the knife wound which caused her death.
but, he acted in self-defence, and I defy you, your notebook or your superior officer to prove otherwise.
Lizzie!
Lizzie!
wait.
Mel was some kind of maniac?
is that what you're saying? She went for him with a knife?
it's the witness giving the evidence, not the barrister.
do you think I'm stupid? No.
she can't answer for herself, but I can.
I'll say it. You're a liar.
you make me sick.
why am I even talking to you? You don't care what she was really like.
no. I do.
really.
you have no talent for it, Ralph.
Helen!
you touched your ear, looked to the ground, licked your lips.
three clear signs of lying.
I thought you analysed dead people for a living.
how are the feet?
got a new beige-coloured carpet put in.
so the skin flakes don't show up so much.
when I...
at the end of the day when I...
you know...
Hi.
I've got to go.
Bye.
under no circumstances must a witness who has given evidence talk to a witness who is yet to give evidence.
and of course, in the police force that absolutely never, ever happens.
self-defence.
well, then, it's all about interpretation.
it will all get subtle, Constable.
and it will all come down to nerve and performance in the witness box.
you like this, don't you, sir? Like it?
it's my "raison d'etre."
which is French for why I exist, young man.
thank you, sir.
you get more good looking every time I prosecute you.
be quiet, there's a police officer coming.
Alison Slaughter. You and me.
how often have we done this? Nervous, Detective Superintendent?
on the contrary. Looking forward to it.
outside just now.
you said you were looking forward to this.
what do you mean by that? The way it goes in the witness box.
you trying trip me up,
I duck and dive and counter-punch. It's a kind of game.
is it?
what are we doing here?
an appalling murder, a devastated parent and a young boy facing life imprisonment and years of vicious abuse in prison if he's convicted.
what kind of a game are we playing, Officer?
I was talking about how cross-examination goes in court.
don't pretend that I meant something else.
and...
what about in the smoking area at your police station?
is what goes on there a game too?
I don't know what you mean.
you intimidated the hell out of this defendant in an attempt to get him to confess to the murder of Melanie Lloyd.
no. Didn't happen.
what do you call your patch of Essex?
the canteen terminology?
in the map of England, where it's positioned, it looks like an arse.
and your patch?
it's an inlet. On the map. The estuary.
we call it the arsehole...
M'Lady.
would I be right in thinking that the arsehole of England is a difficult place to police?
I've known worse, but yes, it's a hard job.
people don't talk easily to the police. But...
this...
this just landed in your lap.
we were able to make a quick arrest.
you could see the guilty verdict right from the off.
the evidence is compelling. And...
everything you've done, every thought you've had since that first moment when Ben Coulter walked into the role of prime suspect has been shaped to fit your opinion of him as the guilty man.
self-defence never entered your head, did it?
the accused was interviewed in the police station.
he had every opportunity to tell us his side of the story.
he was too frightened to tell you anything.
he was represented by a very experienced solicitor and we treated him properly and with respect throughout.
Oh, is that how it is in your police station in the arsehole of England?
do you expect this jury to believe that? It's the truth.
what do you call the CPS in the canteen?
the... "Can't Prosecute Service."
why do you call them that? Because any police officer in the country worth his salt will tell you, they're rubbish.
you despise them because they're in your way.
am I in your way, too?
pace? In your way?
the Murder Inquiry Handbook telling you how you're supposed to conduct a murder inquiry?
in your way.
in your dreams, you are the Sheriff of Arsehole and you are in sole and exclusive charge of the whole criminal justice system and when you can, that's exactly how you behave.
why would I want to do anything like that?
this case is as watertight as it ever gets.
why would I want to behave badly?
because you needed to hear it from the horse's mouth.
because you had a little rumble going on deep inside your guts.
you'd stopped thinking, but your gut, the place where your old-school copper instinct lives, was gnawing away at you...
maybe he didn't murder her.
it's a hideous image, Officer, but your gut was at war with your brain.
no. You wanted him to confess so that your gut ache might go away.
is this a question or a personal attack on my character?
it's a personal attack on your character.
ms Slaughter! I've never asked this question before.
it breaks every rule in the cross-examination rule book.
but I'm going to do it, anyway.
I'm going to ask a very senior police officer why he's so sure about the guilt of an accused.
and I'm going to ask him to address his answer not to the judge, but to the jury.
the evidence.
but what about your gut?
the jury will arrive at their verdict on the basis of the evidence they hear, and nothing else.
court is adjourned for the day.
10 o'clock tomorrow morning.
we could win this.
but we need some instruction.
now you've signed up to self-defence.
let's have some detail.
did she come at you?
she must have.
Ben?
my mum's not in court.
your dad's here.
look at me.
did she come at you with the knife?
Ben.
we could win this.
if you give us something we could win. It doesn't have to be much.
she came at you.
what else could you do?
you had to do it.
or die.
it's over here.
how did you get on?
did you do what your lawyers told you to do?
growing up fast.
Yeah, all right, man.
Yeah, bye.
dad.
dad. It's me. I need to speak to Mum. Can you get her, please, quickly?
I really don't have much time, Dad. Please hurry up.
off! Thanks, Dad.
cell. Go.
15?
18
you wouldn't come near me unless it really mattered.
20
and I wouldn't do this unless I was really interested in why it matters.
I need to phone my mum.
you're telling the truth.
I get it back first thing or I'll kill you.
mum?
it's Ben.
I'll get your dad. No, Mum, it's you I want to talk to.
why did you leave court, Mum?
why didn't you come back?
self-defence," Ben?
is that what you did?
that's what we're saying.
it's the best...
it's the best thing to say, Mum.
mum?
let's go, Bracewell.
see you, Hooch. Yeah, bye, Paulie.
I need go to the chapel.
do you have to? Yes.
I've...
I've lost my inhaler.
every new prisoner wants to be with me.
but it's not sex. They all want their mothers.
I'm the nearest they're going to get. So they come to me.
you've got two inhalers.
Yeah. Sorry...
I forgot.
Joe! Your gate!
look at me.
there, that's fixed you up.
but we'll keep you on a hospital wing for the night.
wait here.
he's a paranoid schizophrenic.
every time we go into his cell, he believes we've come to take him to hell.
he doesn't want to go to hell.
the only safe way is to do it in riot gear.
he gets showered once a week...
I want you to cross examine the expert.
Why?
because he's very experienced, and you're not.
the knife wound on the palm of her hand, the scratch marks on the chest of the defendant, the abrasions to the victim's posterior forchette, the area where the inner lips of the vagina come together...
all these injuries support the Crown's contention that the defendant brutally raped and then murdered Melanie Lloyd.
you're very, very experienced. 25 years as a forensic pathologist.
gosh.
how many times?
in court?
Yes. I have made on average 12 appearances a year for 20 years in cases ranging from serial murder to multiple rape and child abuse.
240 appearances. Yes.
how many times have you appeared for the defence?
none.
240 times and always for the prosecution?
Yes. How much do you get paid?
miss Kapoor!
I am paid that which reflects my level of expertise.
12 times a year, you are paid lots of money by the Crown and they keep coming back to you for more of your expertise.
so it would seem. Have you ever used your very high level of expertise and found for the defence?
no. So every single time, you have given the people who pay you very large amounts of money, exactly the answers they want to hear.
gosh.
I am a witness to this court and I stand by everything I've said.
based on everything I've looked at to do with this case and my long experience,
I am as sure as anyone can be that Melanie Lloyd was raped and murdered by this defendant.
this is intemperate and unprofessional.
it's preposterous to suggest he did it in self-defence.
nobody with an ounce of common sense would believe this man was defending himself when Melanie Lloyd died.
that's for the jury to decide.
this witness... He's right.
it wasn't self-defence.
I think you'd better be quiet, Mr Coulter.
I don't want this.
I don't want this defence. I didn't kill her.
jury out.
nobody will let me speak!
for God's sake,
I've been trying to speak to somebody.
nobody will listen to me!
I think we might need more time, my Lady.
fuck me.
self-defence wasn't what I wanted. They were your instructions.
they were your instructions about what my instructions should be.
I asked you to look me in the eye and tell me if I was wrong. You signed up.
well, now I'm taking it back.
then that's the end of you and me.
I'll tell the judge I'm professionally embarrassed.
goodbye, Ben
good luck.
I presume you're pulling the plug too?
Oh, right.
you can't afford to have professional standards.
I'm pragmatic.
is that enough?
can you look yourself in the mirror in the morning and say, "I'm a pragmatist, that'll do for me"?
the rest is hypocrisy.
are you calling me a hypocrite?
he wants me to carry on on my own. How do you feel about that?
honestly?
about ten years old and absolutely terrified.
and I'd really like to smoke about seven cigarettes all at once.
but I'm going to do it.
because for once, way too late in the day,
Ben should get what he's been asking for all along.
you.
and, don't tell me. The truth.
judge Ira has adjourned for the day.
so we've got the weekend to build a defence.
it's unlike Ira to be nice to the defence.
she's not being nice.
she knows if she doesn't give me any time and Ben is convicted, our grounds of appeal will be ready made.
I'm going to tell you something.
I'm just gonna say what it is that I remember.
OK?
I don't know what happened.
I left the bedroom.
I woke up in the kitchen.
I went back up to the bedroom, to say goodbye.
she was dead.
that's it.
Ben, the trouble is, it doesn't explain anything.
it just says, "I didn't do it." It's not a proper defence.
but it's true.
changing everything mid-trial looks really bad.
and it isn't as if it's switching to something coherent.
I'm not stupid, and I haven't changed my story!
none of you have been listening to me!
I know, I know, it's not a good defence, I know that.
I wish to God that I could tell you something more, but I can't! I don't remember!
I don't remember.
that's all there is.
I believe you.
single stab wound, murder weapon in his pocket, defence wounds found on her and on him.
where was she found?
in bed.
how soon would a second PM be possible?
he's in the dock, she's in the ground.
the trial has started.
Where's the defence expert, Stone?
you didn't like their findings.
preliminary chat only.
and you didn't like their preliminary chat?
would you have a look at the PM?
assume someone else other than my client committed the murder and see if there's anything to support that.
I'd be very grateful.
he's got to you, hasn't he?
at last someone's finally got to you.
I'm just doing my job.
you know what our problem was?
your professional life is all about looking for doubt.
mine is about searching for the truth.
do you ever get lonely?
never. You?
never.
the answer's no. Before you ask.
let's stick to your innocent client and leave ourselves out of it.
you'll help me, then? I'm here, aren't I?
do you have a copy of A Very English Hangman by Leonora Klein?
it's about Albert Pierrepoint.
I think so. Let me have a look. Thank you.
Hello!
Oh, my God. It's you. Are you following me?
Yeah.
what do you want?
I think that you and me are probably after the same thing.
Really?
justice.
for Melanie, for her dad, for you.
I've agonised long and hard about the defence we're running.
I've persuaded the others to drop all that stuff about Melanie being crazy.
our barrister couldn't handle what I'd done. So she's gone.
so what are you saying now? We don't know.
thank you.
which is why I'm here pretending to bump into you.
we need your help.
I'll think about it. Think about anyone else who may have wanted to hurt Melanie.
you look as though you've been here all weekend.
bottom line, Frances.
you're going to lose.
but, we're all members of the bar and I'd hate to see you humiliated.
I know how badly you're out of your depth. So, if there's anything I can help you with, just ask.
OK?
the days of defence ambushes are over.
tell me now what your new defence is.
the court and the Crown are entitled to know.
Ben Coulter did not kill Melanie Lloyd.
so far, so blindingly obvious.
somebody else did.
who?
the killer must have been in the house already or gained entry whilst the defendant was asleep.
who?
mr Painter.
how does the Crown feel about all this ducking and diving?
the complete U-turn by the defence halfway through a trial is...
something we can live with.
you mean something you'll be making a great deal of.
that's another way of putting it.
you're very junior, Ms Kapoor.
I want to be absolutely sure that you and your client are happy to continue.
I'm totally sure.
very well.
let's have the jury back in.
I want to recall PC Jeary.
there's just one thing.
your notebook.
it's a very good notebook. Very detailed and all that...
miss Kapoor, what's your question?
when did you write it? At the first available opportunity.
everything still fresh in your mind?
I'll never forget it.
every last detail.
excellent.
this is a bit random...
but, here we are.
the lamp was on the ground at a 60-degree angle to the bed.
the ventalin inhaler was on the bed between nine and ten inches to the right of the deceased's right shoulder.
very, um... precise and exact.
thank you.
Where's the inhaler?
nine or ten inches to the right of... No, no.
now.
perhaps we should ask your senior officer.
thank you.
what is that piece of paper? It's a list of exhibits.
would that list include everything found at the scene relevant to the murder trial?
Yes.
you've been a police officer for 30 years.
Yes.
you know all there is to know about crime scenes.
one thing I know is how to read a crime scene.
would you consider a personal item belonging to the defendant and found between nine and ten inches from the deceased's body relevant to this murder trial? Yes.
would you agree with me that removing any item from a crime scene would be grossly unprofessional, and counter to all the rules of police practice and criminal justice?
Yes.
Where's the ventalin inhaler on that list of exhibits?
it's not there.
it's in PC Jeary's notebook.
Yes.
it was there when he was the first officer on the scene. Yes.
who was the next person to enter the bedroom in which the body was found?
probably me.
where is it, Officer?
what did you do with the inhaler?
I took it.
you took it?
you found it in her bed, and you took it? You removed a piece of evidence from a crime scene?
why would you do that? He needed it.
the defendant's asthma was causing him problems in the police station.
I wanted to help him. I'm sorry.
that's a lie. That's just not true, is it?
it doesn't fit.
the inhaler in her bed.
it doesn't fit with rape and violent murder.
it looks like she wanted him in her bed. That's why you took it.
you've got 30 years' experience in the police force.
if you know anything, it's how to read a crime scene.
come and sit down.
you know, outside I have interests in many enterprises.
tropical fish, tractors,
I have to keep myself engaged.
so, in here I work with the market I've got.
the first days of a trial are always stressful.
we've brought you something to help you unwind.
roll up your sleeve.
I don't want to.
this is the first. You'll be back for more, sooner or later.
Ben couldn't kill anyone, but the jury don't know it.
because they haven't had a good look at him.
him being a nice kid is not going to count for it when Painter cross-examines his convenient amnesia into the ground.
what kind of sex?
what do you mean? No foreplay?
no, not really. It was...
she was...
asking for it to be like that. Melanie was "asking for it"?
massive, massive problem. Whole trial blown out the water.
what the hell's going on?
he had a problem with non-disclosure. It's gone away.
Lizzie Smith. She can tell us all about Melanie's jealous, violent boyfriend,
Stuart, and the fight he had with Melanie's dad.
have you got any idea how I feel?
I'm tired because I am trying to stay alive!
I want your disagreements with this man to end.
get me out of here. Please.
all along, I've tried to tell you the truth.
I just want you all to listen.
little CREEK RESERVIOR, VA
go on, Mudgie! Go on, boy.
Attaboy!
go on, boy.
come! Come!
Strauss, I'm coming in to see you this afternoon.
well, then cancel it. I'll be there at 2: 30.
that's it. Come on, boy!
come on! Yeah.
I really don't understand this, David.
what's to understand, Erin?
you've been retired for nearly 10 years.
B.A.U. Is a man down.
I'm offering to help.
you've written... how many books?
world tours.
speaking engagements.
big payday private consultations.
you've made quite a name for yourself.
well, this is getting boring.
you know, you won't be in charge.
agent Hotchner's the S.A.C. And I'll be seeking his endorsement.
I'm not looking for anyone's permission here.
so you're coming in in a subordinate position.
is that a question? - The question is, why?
to help.
a completely selfless act.
is that so hard to believe?
Yes.
I missed you too, Erin.
you'll meet the team tomorrow.
Carrollton, TEXAS
have YOU SEEN ME?
it was next to my front door when I got home, Frank.
God, I hate Halloween.
here you go, sir. - Halloween?
police Department, CARROLLTON, TEXAS
less than a week away.
it's a prime time for stupid pranks.
so you think it's just a prank?
well, you're obviously not missing, Michelle.
Where'd they get a picture of me?
it's probably one of your friends.
I don't know anybody that'd think this is funny.
Molly didn't think it was funny.
she's the one who told me to come right down here.
if my wife had just called, I probably could have saved you the trip.
I'm sure it's nothing, really.
you sure?
look...
I'll come by and check on you after work and make sure you're safe.
I appreciate that, Frank.
Hey. Serving and protecting is what I do.
no, no, I didn't say it was funny, Molly.
I said someone might
I--I know she's your best friend. That's why I'm here.
no. No, I don't think it's weird she didn't call
look, I'm here already.
all the lights are out.
she--she probably went to bed early.
I'll have her call you.
Yeah, 20 minutes. I love you, too.
this wasn't funny the first time.
Michelle, it's Frank!
Oh, my god.
federal Bureau of Investigation QUANTICO, VIRGINIA
erasmus wrote, what else is the whole life of mortals but a sort of comedy, in which the various actors, disguised by various costumes and masks, walk on and play each one his part, until the manager waves them off the stage?
I'm waiting for you!
happy all hallows eve, folks.
to paraphrase from Celtic mythology, tomorrow night all order is suspended, and the barriers between the natural and the supernatural are temporarily removed!
see, that right there is why Halloween creeps me out.
you're scared of Halloween?
I didn't say I was scared, I said I was crept out.
there's a difference there, youngster. You should look it up.
what creeps you out about it?
I don't know. People wearing masks.
I don't like folks in disguises.
that's the best thing about halloween. You can be anyone you want to be.
Nah, I'm pretty good just being me.
Yeah, why is it that neither of those points of view surprise me?
you know what, though? On the flip side, it does provide a pretty good reason to cozy up with a scary flick and a little halloween honey.
Halloween honey. Now I'm creeped out.
guys, he's here.
agent Hotchner.
I'm sure you remember... - Dave.
how are you, Aaron?
I'm good. I'm great. - I would say so.
saw you on TV last week.
can't believe you want to come back here.
well, I'll let the two of you catch up.
if you need anything, I'm in my office. - Thanks.
so how long's it been?
dinner, almost 3 years ago.
but the last time I was in the B.A.U.
you were sharing a desk with 2 other agents in that god-awful bunker we were in.
I remember.
Congratulations. - Thanks.
well, there's one just like this next door if you're interested.
I'm ready to give the briefing.
agent Jareau, this is S.S.A. David Rossi.
Hi. Everyone calls me J. J.
it is such an honor to meet you, sir.
I've heard a lot about you. - Thank you.
and what's your function here?
I'm the communications coordinator and liaison.
pretty much the go-between for the team and the rest of the world.
so I'll gather everyone.
we'll be right there.
it is so nice to have you here, sir. - Great.
we didn't have that 10 years ago.
what do you mean?
communications coordinator. - Right.
Oh, lots has changed. Come meet the team.
S.S.A. Dvid Rossi, this is S.S.A. Emily Prentiss.
sir.
S.S.A. Derek Morgan.
it's an honor, Agent Rossi.
please, just Dave.
and Dr. Spencer Reid.
sir, if I could talk to you later about your work with the scarsdale skinner.
Psycho-linguistics is an incredibly dynamic field, and the fact that your profile of his reading habits ultimately led to his capture - is something I find so incredibly intrig... - Reid, slow down.
he'll be here for a while. You can catch up with him later.
sorry. - No problem, doctor.
maybe you guys can talk on the jet.
Oh, yeah, that'd be great. - The jet?
we have a jet now.
are you serious? - Yeah. It comes in pretty handy.
come on. J. J.'S waiting.
Carrollton, Texas, is a suburb just outside of dallas.
4 days ago, Michelle Colucci found this flier on her front door.
she found it?
meaning she wasn't actually missing?
yet. She took the flier to a friend's husband, detective Yarbrough, at the Carrollton P. D.
who told her it was probably just a Halloween prank, and he sent her home.
well, I don't blame him.
Halloween brings out the fool in everyone.
still, he stopped by Michelle's house later to check on her.
the door was open, and when he went inside, he found this.
he still thought maybe it could be some kind of a prank, until yesterday.
Michelle was found floating in a small creek just outside of Carrollton.
she had been sexually assaulted...
and her face had been removed.
removed? It wasn't animals or fish?
the dallas county M. E. Say that the edges of the wounds were smooth, not torn.
a very sharp instrument had been used.
he also found water in her lungs.
Oh, my god!
what is that?
technical analyst Penelope Garcia, this is ssa David Rossi.
is it gone, J.J?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're safe.
OK. Just to, um...
Carrollton, texas, has nearly 117, 000 residents, a diverse population with A... it's all in there.
I'm sorry.
very happy to meet you, sir.
I'll be in my office.
sorry.
she's different.
you have no idea.
uh, so, the unsub tells her she's going to go missing to psychologically torture her, then tortures her physically.
textbook sadist.
a sophisticated one.
that's elaborate.
number one.
that particular mask is known as a false face.
it's most commonly worn during halloween and Mardi Gras.
creepy. I rest my case.
false face.
her face-- he mocks it, then destroys it.
Oh, and, Hotch-- local media has the story. It broke big.
tell Carrollton we'll be there first thing in the morning.
let's stop this one at one. - Yes, sir.
if you want to take some time to get situated, maybe start on the next case?
I'm not back to get situated, Hotch, I'm here to work.
everybody get your things together. We're going to texas.
Abbey, what's the latest?
police sources tell me they have no leads in the case they are calling the "have you seen me"Murders.
where the hell do you get this stuff?
no, not you, agent Jareau. The television.
the press is saying we gave this thing a stupid name, like it's some kind of damn game or something.
just...
call me when you all get in tomorrow. I'll take you wherever you need to go.
all right. Good night.
Abbey, do we know when this flyer first surfaced?
we have heard reports that ms. Colucci received this flier late tuesday afternoon when she returned home from work.
never saw the point at throwing an egg at anything.
dallas, TEXAS
or even the connection to halloween, for that matter.
what the hell...
Oh, my god. That's me.
Oh, my god!
let's go over victimology.
would you like to join us, Dave?
Reid, what have you got?
uh, Michelle Colucci was single, lived alone, no boyfriend and no ex-husband.
dating?
there's nothing in the reports.
she was an architect.
friends and co-workers say she's a class workaholic.
basically a loner who rarely went out of the house.
so she's extremely low risk.
if it wasn't someone she knew personally, it's possible she was being stalked.
interesting. - What's that?
Oh, I'm just thinking out loud.
something to add? - No.
sorry to interrupt.
well, she's pretty.
it could be that the unsub met her casually and...
made her part of some kind of fantasy.
and he tries to act on it and she rejects him?
so he tortures her, out of anger?
masks often represent a state of mind.
this one's blank, expressionless. Doesn't really coincide with anger.
Reid, it's hard to imagine he did this out of anything less than rage.
Hey, guys.
what's up? You got something for us?
a list of Michelle Colucci's clients.
she designed office space. Mostly big corporate remodeling plans.
no private clients, one-on-one contact?
doesn't look like it, no.
Thanks, baby girl. - Yeah.
it's right this way, ma'am.
police Department CARROLLTON. TEXAS - Detective Yarbrough? - Fbi?
we got another flier-- this time metro dallas.
her roommate called dallas P. D.This morning.
Enid never game home after walking her dog last night.
so she is missing.
well, he wallpapered the neighborhood with fliers for 2 blocks around their apartment.
outside. That's different.
no one saw him putting them up?
dallas P. D.Is still canvassing, but nothing so far.
they're waiting for you on the new scene.
mind if I keep this? - Not at all.
Morgan, you and Prentiss go to Michelle Colucci's house.
J. J.And I will talk to Enid's roommate.
Dave, do you mind walking the disposal site with the detective and Reid?
whatever you need.
we'll regroup in an hour.
these houses sure are close together.
Yeah.
so how do I get a woman out of her house without anyone seeing me?
well, he must have been watching her for a long time and knew that it was safe.
there isn't a lot of cover on this street.
I have a vehicle.
big enough so I can watch without being seen.
but not so big as to draw attention to itself.
no.
neighbors will notice a strange vehicle parked in front of their house day after day, night after night.
it's human nature.
you would notice something out of place in your own neighborhood.
and you would definitely notice a man repeatedly standing on your street.
Yeah. It just doesn't make any sense.
he didn't watch from here.
as we reported earlier, Enid White is still considered missing...
big story.
leeches.
haven't had something this big to play in a long time.
did the press run with the story about the mask?
mask?
a mask was left at Michelle Colucci's apartment.
first time I'm hearing about it.
good.
let's make sure that stays ours. - Yeah.
miss white's roommate says that Enid walks her dog every night at the same time , takes the same route, right down this street.
nothing a stalker likes better than routine.
well, she definitely would have seen this if this was here before she went missing.
a couple of neighbors say they may have seen a guy putting up a flier during the day, bueaey rt thlly couldn't remember anything about him.
all right, well, we're gonna have to know everything we can about the victim.
I know you sent some stuff over to quantico, but it would help us if we could interview the roommate ourselves.
we have her downtown now.
Where's her dog? - Excuse me?
if she was abducted while she was walking her dog. Where's her dog?
we went over this area pretty thoroughly.
there's no evidence left.
I just want to stand where she was.
Dr. Reid, do we still keep all the old files in the fourth floor storeroom?
I think some are up there. You know, most of our information's on computer now.
right.
have you had a chance to go through our data since you've been back?
not yet.
you'll be amazed.
the original team
I mean, you interviewed something like, - uh, 45 serial killers, right? - Something like.
today we have interviews with over 1, 000 offenders.
serial killers, child abductors, sex offenders.
I'll go through it with you sometime if you like, answer any questions.
sounds good.
Michelle's body was found right here.
I really thought it was a prank.
you can't really blame yourself for that.
she made herself dinner.
excuse me?
she had time to make herself dinner.
I mean she was home for a while before he...
there was time to help her.
water.
obliterates a body...
destroys evidence.
but you weren't in the water that long, were you, Michelle?
she had rocks tied to her to weigh her down.
she floated to the surface before there was any other damage.
just what was done to her already.
the salient point is that it was the first thing the unsub wasn't good at.
green river dumped most of the bodies in the water.
but they weren't weighed down. - Yeah.
we know now it's 'cause he didn't care if they were found.
he had no connection to them.
this is where I'd wait.
Yeah.
I'd never be able to see you from the house.
he was here a lot.
watching everything she did.
we got anything?
agent Rossi pointed out that since the victims were weighted down, it suggests the unsub didn't want them found.
it suggests some sort of connection between them.
detective, how long was Michelle missing?
she was found on the fourth day.
so if she wasn't in the water long, then he held her for 3.
I've been running all of Enid White's credit cards.
And?
she made a purchase at 9 A. M.this morning at a sporting goods store in dallas.
this morning?
what did she buy?
a shotgun.
Thanks.
the man was seen posting fliers around the neighborhood where Enid White was known to walk her dog.
the police are still unable to give us any information at this time, and they are saying they still have no possible leads.
we will continue to keep you posted as we receive more details about the hunt for Enid White...
she can buy a gun that easily?
this is texas.
there's no license or waiting period for most rifles or shotguns.
is there video surveillance of guns sales in sporting goods stores?
there's supposed to be.
J. J.Call the store.
find out if it was Enid or the unsub using her credit card.
right away.
detective Yarbrough.
there's an urgent call from a woman on one.
detective Yarbrough.
my name is Enid White.
where are you, Enid?
the news reports said that the police didn't believe that other woman when she saw the missing fliers.
that was a mistake, Enid.
I have a gun.
I don't think I can stay awake very much longer.
Enid, this is agent Hotchner of the fbi.
we believe you, and we want to help you.
can you tell us where you are?
el royale motel in dallas.
it's room 6.
I saw the fliers.
hurry, please.
he's gonna kill me.
don't move, Enid. We're on our way.
clear.
she's gone.
20 minutes.
we were here in 20 minutes.
I can't believe we lost her.
we may not have lost her. He kept Michelle for 4 days.
but we got nothing.
that's not true. Look at the difference in the scenes.
what do you mean? There's the masks, the fliers.
Yeah, but these fliers weren't tacked up, they were just thrown around the room.
so?
he left in a hurry like he knew we were coming.
OK, this was under the bed.
972 area code.
that's Carrollton.
the hotline number.
she used a cell phone.
you can get a cell interceptor at any electronics store.
you can?
Yeah. They don't cost that much.
he probably sat right out here and heard everything she said.
but if he followed her here from dallas, why wait till she calls us to move on her?
to make sure it was the police who found the mask.
we need to gather your men and give a profile.
he's a white male.
his shoe prints have been examined and put him at about 5'11, 165.
so we've narrowed it down to anyone of average weight and height.
exactly.
speak and be recognized by your empress, mortal.
is this the technical analyst girl?
who's this?
Dr. Reid said this was your direct line from the team.
it is.
this is agent Dave Rossi. We met yesterday.
of course, of course. I'm sorry--sir.
uh, yeah, I already started processing the footprint information on Michelle Colucci
no, no, no. This is about something else.
all the past open cases the B. A.U. worked on are on computer now?
most of them.
there may be a few left to catalog.
if I give you a victim's name, could you find the old records?
Oh, records are my specialty, sir.
the original case-- I'm going back 20 years.
won't be a problem.
the name is Galen.
Diana and Richard Galen.
they had 3 children.
OK. I will get back to you super fast. Scout's honor.
no, no, um, just put a file together.
I'll get it when I get back.
it's really no problem, sir. I could just send it
not necessary. I'll look at it when I get back.
and let's keep this between us, if you don't mind. For now.
OK.
thank you.
my pleasure entirely, sir.
there's a sophistication and patience in what this unsub does that suggests a level of maturity.
we believe this puts his age in the mid-30s to 40s range.
Michelle Colucci was taken from the primary crime scene and disposed of at the tertiary crime scene 4 days later.
that means she was held somewhere for at least 3 days.
you can't really just hold a victim anywhere for days on end, so he most likely has access to a house of some kind.
and he's also fairly tech savvy.
the fliers were made on a computer.
and it's probable that he used a device to intercept Enid White's phone call.
witnesses in Enid White's neighborhood say they may have seen a white man putting up fliers, but none of them could describe him, even with all the media attention this case has received.
great.
actually, what that tells us is that there is absolutely nothing remarkable about this man.
he is exceedingly average.
as you said, detective Yarbrough, average height, average build.
it extends to his professional life as well.
he most likely works in a field where he doesn't stand out, doesn't really make a mark.
his lack of distinction is part of his psychopathy.
we have hundreds of interactions with people every day.
most of those involve someone overlooking someone else.
most of us don't pay any attention to being ignored, but to this kind of unsub, each oversight is intentional.
especially when it comes from his object of sexual desire.
he begins to obsess over her until she's all he can think about.
and the rage builds until he has to attack that person.
so he's pissed off that nobody notices him?
have you seen me?
wait. That's not about the women.
no. The masks are about the women
number one, number 2.
the fliers probably refer to him.
removing his victims' faces transfers his feelings of being ignored into a mission and it gives him a sense of power.
and the power can make him arrogant, but it doesn't make him notable.
so how the hell do we catch an invisible man?
I'm pretty sure we can get him to contact you.
what?
well, the crime scenes show he wants to deliver his message to the police.
he isn't going public.
hopefully, by playing on his anger...
J. J.How'd they get that?
not from me. I
Hotch, I called all the local police departments and I stressed withholding the mask.
I called them.
what?
I said the fbi thinks the masks mean he's impotent.
can I speak to you for a second?
why would you do that?
it'll make him contact us.
he's screaming for it.
we aren't prepared.
prepared?
we need to set up a trap and trace.
trap and trace?
they never stay on the phone long enough for that.
Dave, they're a lot faster than they used to be.
we also need to prep the detective on what to say to him.
he's not gonna want to talk to the detective.
he's gonna want to talk to the fbi.
we don't step over the local police like that.
they called us in.
Yes, but if the perception is that we're to embarrass the locals by telling the media that we're gonna fix things, then they'll stop calling us.
relax, Hotch. I've got this.
you see, that's the problem, Dave.
there is no I.
we function as a team.
I've been doing this before you were out of high school, probably before the rest of your team was in school at all.
I know that.
things have changed.
the bells and whistles changed.
an unsub is still an unsub, and I know how to deal with an unsub.
no, Dave, it's not just that. - Hotch.
what?
Garcia found something.
Garcia, talk to us.
so, Michelle Colucci recently drew up the plans for a remodel of 3 floors of a company called techco communications.
it's a high-tech communications company in downtown dallas.
and Enid White?
worked there until 2 months ago.
he's on 2.
the unsub?
demanded to speak to the fbi.
this is fbi supervisory special agent David Rossi.
you called me impotent.
did I?
I'm not impotent.
why are you whispering?
you lied.
you lied.
is someone around you?
are you at work?
you have to tell the news the truth.
I'll get you on the news, then you can correct me yourself.
no, you, you, you correct it.
by the way, I was, um, looking at the police security tapes for the day Michelle Colucci went missing.
what?
you watched her long enough to know she didn't have visitors.
she was a loner.
yet you knew that detective Yarbrough was coming over.
you must have been right here in this station when he told her.
now, your face is gonna be on one of those tapes, and when I find it,
I'm gonna paper this city with it, just like you did with those women.
everyone will see it.
they won't be able to ignore you now.
but you won't inspire fear, you'll inspire hatred and ridicule, because the only power someone like you has is a mask, and once that mask is removed, you'll be as insignificant as you've always been
a loser!
you just signed Enid White's death warrant.
lieutenant, I need you to lock the techco building down tight.
nobody in, nobody out. It's vital.
Rossi, you really think the unsub's still gonna be there after that call?
of course. He thinks he has all the time in the world.
you think they got an image off the police security camera yet?
the security camera doesn't work. I lied about that.
you lied about that?
he doesn't know.
Dave, that was incredibly reckless.
Hotch, he didn't weigh the body down well.
what do you mean?
he didn't want Michelle found so quickly.
he screwed that up.
this kind of guy, when he plans something, if he has the time, if he's in control, he's meticulous.
but being on the edge of the river, out in the open, he was not in control.
he was in a hurry, and he made a mistake.
that's what you're hoping.
trust me.
with an unsub like this, you need to throw him off his game.
his hand needs to be forced.
I know that, Dave, but the point is, you did it by forcing ours.
is the building sealed? - Top to bottom.
Yarbrough, make sure it stays that way.
Garcia, which floors did Michelle carlucci remodel?
got it--7, 8,9.
Morgan, take 7.
we're looking for a rank-and-file employee who made a scene in the last 20 minutes or was here and gone.
Prentiss, 8,Reid, 9.
don't approach him. Just...
try to get a name, maybe a picture.
he's somewhere in this lobby.
Why?
can't you feel it?
display your credentials. Fbi.
he thinks we know what he looks like.
got him.
sir?
sir!
we have your address, Max. There's no place to go.
this is agent Rossi, Max.
if you do what you're thinking, you won't get to tell them I lied.
come on, Max, slowly put your hands on top of your head.
listen to him, Max.
I know what you're thinking and you don't have to do it.
it doesn't have to end here, Max.
please.
down!
you ok? - Yeah.
he's gone. - What about Enid White?
we have his home address.
is she there?
let's hope so.
you said out there, the team shares everything.
that's right.
there is no I?
it seems a big thing to withhold.
separating from your wife, your child.
what are you talking about?
you used to call haley 10 times a day.
we've been together 48 hours, I haven't seen you call her once.
haven't mentioned her.
and you're not going home now.
what's your point?
I guess you're just not used to sharing.
my private life is not the same as a case.
I'm just saying, sharing is a learned skill.
you know...
when this all started...
there were only a few of us.
we'd go out on the road alone.
we didn't... groupthink.
we don't groupthink.
we think as individuals, and we share the thoughts with the rest of the team.
we don't write them down in a little notebook and keep them to ourselves.
all this-- the people we've helped, the ones we've put away, it's...
because of you and the guys who started this unit, who believed when nobody else did that there was a way of understanding these crimes and getting ahead of them.
And?
I don't see that you have anything to prove.
you don't have to come back.
I know that.
so why?
maybe I have unfinished business.
what's this?
Ooh, is mommy gonna get Danny? Is mommy gonna get Danny?
mommy's gonna get Danny! Oh, mommy's got Danny!
mommy got Danny! Mommy loves you.
that was fun.
fooled you. Fooled you.
Hey, Abby, wait up.
Hey, let's stop here. I like this view.
Hey, watch it.
Seriously?
mommy got danny!
I'm sorry, baby. We must have caught something today.
you're burning up.
case must be local. JJ said not to bring a go bag.
what's the army doing here?
what the hell is going on?
guys, this is Dr. Linda kimura, chief of special pathogens with the CDC.
hello. - Hello.
I'm sorry to meet under these circumstances.
what circumstances? - We need to get started.
last night, 25 people checked into emergency rooms in and around Annapolis.
they were all at the same park after 2 p. m. yesterday.
within 10 hours, the first victim died.
it's now just past 7 a. m. The next day, we have 12 dead.
lung failure and black lesions. Anthrax?
anthrax doesn't kill this fast.
this strain does.
what are we doing about potential mass tarts-- airports, malls, trains?
there's a media blackout.
we're not telling the public? - We'd have a mass exodus.
the psychology of group panic would cause more deaths than this last attack.
Yeah, and if it does get out or if there is another attack, there's no way we'll be able to keep it quiet.
our best chance of protecting the public is by building a profile as quickly as we can.
what do we know about this strain?
the spores are weaponized, reduced to a respiral ideal that attacks deep in the lungs.
odorless and invisible.
a sophisticated strain.
only a scientist would know how to do that.
these lesions are doubling in size in a matter of hours.
it's not the lesions I'm worried about. It's the lungs.
we don't know how to combat the toxins once they're inside.
and the reality is, we may lose them all.
the remaining survivors have been moved to a special wing at Walter Reed Hospital.
our offices will become a small command center.
we'll be working with military scientists from Fort Detrick.
general Whitworth is coming here?
he's in charge of site containment and spore analysis.
determining what strain this is will help inform who's responsible.
my team is in charge of treating all victims.
Reid, go with dr. Kimura to the hospital. Interview the victims.
morgan and Prentiss, there's a hazmat team that will accompany you to the crime scene.
there's cipro. Everybody needs to take it before we go.
we don't know if it's effective against this strain, but it's something.
this is really happening?
we knew this could happen. We've done our homework. We've prepared for this. This is it.
jin dan. May you live 100 years.
"it will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and will become boils breaking out with sores on man and beast through all the land of Egypt."
exodus 9: 9.
do you have those files I've been looking for?
did you see this memo from the director?
Office-files and emails are being monitored.
Yeah, they're trying to protect the media blackout. Files?
uh, yeah, right here. - Thanks.
I want to see what kind of medical treatment the victims received before I head to the hospital.
why do you think the suspect in 2001 stopped sending the letters?
I have no idea, but if he hadn't, it would have been much worse.
the worst part was not knowing when it was gonna be over.
feeling safe opening mail again.
5 people died. Many more exposed and sickened, including a baby
who was admitted to the hospital after lesions appeared on his skin.
how did he contract it? - I have no idea.
must have come into close contact with a tainted letter or crossed paths with the unsub himself.
how old was the baby? - 7 months.
did he survive? - I gotta run. Kimura's waiting.
I'll call you from the hospital. - Spence.
did the baby survive?
Yeah, but, I mean, that was a curable strain.
this thing's entirely different.
agent Jareau.
uh, call me when he gets through security. Thanks.
the general's here. Is there bad blood with him?
he was very critical of the way the '01 Amerithrax investigation was handled.
because of what happened with Dr. Hatfill.
among other things.
and this is the list of victims you asked for.
no high-profile jobs. - No. Just ordinary people frolicking in the park.
any word from the CIA?
they said there are a few overseas terrorist groups with funding and capability.
they're working international. We've got domestic.
we need to look at anyone who could profit from this.
people who have patents on anthrax vaccines.
Garcia. - Yes, sir.
and add to your list anyone with access to weaponized spores.
employees of labs who keep germ collections.
be back in a few.
right in here, sir. - Thank you, agent Jareau.
general. - Agent Hotchner.
this is SSA David Rossi.
my scientists are decoding the strain.
the additives used to strengthen the bacterial capsules do not exist at our research labs.
are there any other labs using these substances? - No.
I'd like a list of all the scientists in your anthrax program.
I just said we don't use those additives.
sir, we can rule out your lab samples, but not your people.
we're looking at someone who has the ability to manipulate and weaponize anthrax.
your scientists make that cut.
now, we all know what happened the last time your team looked into my people.
sir, our team officially ruled out Dr. Hatfill.
I'm sorry if justice didn't listen to us, but the profile was accurate.
well, I'm outranked by someone who believes in your profiles.
I'll get you your list. Lieutenant.
Hi, Abby. You feeling any better?
OK. This is agent Reid from the FBI.
if you can, will you talk with him?
Abby,I'd like to try to do a memory recall exercise with you to take you back to the park, if that's ok.
I need you to close your eyes.
yesterday afternoon, you rode your bicycle to the park.
how did the sun feel on your skin, the breeze through your hair?
can you describe for me what you heard and the people that you saw?
it was warm, windy.
there were guys... Football.
kids...
I see free...
all right, Abby. That's ok. You just rest now, ok?
you just rest. Ok? Thank you.
what's causing her aphasia?
the poison is infecting the parietal lobe, impairing her speech.
some of the other patients displayed the same symptoms shortly before they died.
none of the drug combinations are working?
the only thing that's helping them right now is the morphine.
what are you telling people about why the park is closed?
methane buildup in the sewage system.
and they believe it? Oh, well, yeah, of course, why wouldn't they?
hot zone and all surrounding areas have been neutralized.
you're safe here. - Are you sure?
Yes, ma'am. - Thank you.
OK, check it out.
high levels tested over there.
that's probably where the unsub released the attack.
and there was a prevailing wind out of the northeast yesterday.
airborne spores scattered that way, hitting everyone below it.
this park doesn't scream "target" to me.
terrorists usually target symbols-- white house, pentagon, world trade center.
I mean, it's a nice park, but it's not a symbol.
OK, so, maybe it's symbolic for the unsub.
well, we know Kaczynski sent bombs to berkeley where he taught,
michigan where he went to school, and chicago where he lived.
and the amerithrax suspect sent letters to 2 pro-choice senators whose politics he opposed.
they can't help attaching a personal motive to the places they've targeted.
OK. So, what does this place mean to our unsub?
38-year-old high school history teacher.
leaves 2 kids behind. - 17 out of 25 dead.
this strain is duplicating every 30 to 45 minutes.
it's poisoning the lungs, causing massive hemorrhaging and organ failure.
extreme bacterial amplification.
whoever created this had to at some point go to the trouble of testing it.
what do you mean?
think about the way scientists work their way up to human testing.
they start with rodents, then advance to larger mammals,
and then at some point, they do a very small trial run with people.
there's no way this was his first human test run.
we would have heard about a previous anthrax attack.
not if it presented itself as something else.
the general's briefing a congressional committee,
and the director's meeting with the president in an hour and wants our input.
I don't know how to do this.
I can't stop thinking about henry.
he goes for a walk almost every single day at Potomac park.
what type of mother am i if i don't at least call and tell him to stay at home?
JJ, we can't. - I know, but...
how do I not?
I understand that you want to protect your son.
but if we all called home and used this information to give us an advantage that other people don't have...
is that the right thing to do?
we need to call Reid. He said this may not be the first attack.
Hello? - Uh, Reid, you have me, Rossi, and Hotch.
kimura made some calls. It turns out that 2 days ago, 2 people in 2 separate baltimore e. r. And one person in a philadelphia e. r slipped into comas and died suddenly. Now, the c. o.d. on all of them was meningitis.
doctors didn't test for anthrax because the illnesses presented themselves as meningitis,
but i think it can be caused by anthrax.
did they show symptoms that we're seeing now-- the lesions?
they wouldn't have if the bodily functions expired as quickly as they did.
how quickly? - All dead within 3 hours of being admitted.
but the first patient died yesterday at 10 hours.
here's the thing-- if they inhaled a higher concentration of the strain, it would cause a quicker death. Organ failure without exterior physical symptoms.
what are their names?
gale mercer, 31, martha finestein, 48, albert franks, 52. What next?
see if they visited the same place on may 8th.
gale mercer made a credit card purchase at the book front, owned by albert franks.
we need to find general Whitworth. He needs to sent a team out there.
all right, JJ, I got it. Thanks.
look at all these people just going about their lives.
if they only knew what we were doing here.
better that they don't.
JJ says the store's been closed since the owner died.
gale mercer's credit card purchase happened right before closing.
well, that explains why only 3 people were hit.
we tested hot. I'll alert command.
this was his test run.
he's gotta have a history with the place.
we need to get a list of current and past employees, customers with grievances against the owner,
see if any one of them had a science background.
can you believe there is only a quarter-inch-thick pane of glass between all of us and a wmd?
attack anthrax wasn't made to kill 3 people inside a bookstore.
it wants to be right out here in the open, where it can feed and multiply.
just a small amount could wipe out everyone here.
and they'd never see it coming.
it feels like the plagues of egypt.
10 scourges created by god.
plague 6 was unhealable boils believed by biblical scholars to be caused by anthrax.
never missed sunday school, did you?
actually, never been before. How is she doing?
she's a fighter.
she's held on this long because she's young and strong.
but she's started to bleed into her lungs.
one of 4 left.
we're running into another problem.
when the next of kin have questions, what do we tell them about cause of death?
Yes, sir.
we'll do what we can in the time we've got.
thank you.
there are problems containing the story. - What happened?
I don't know, but the president may have to make an announcement tonight.
what did you hear from the bookstore?
ran names of former employees, customers with grievances.
no one with the science background we're looking for.
Garcia's still digging.
do we have everyone we need for the profile?
Oh, yeah. Entire defense community is here.
never seen so many alpha males in one room.
let's get started.
because the locations hit are not symbolically significant, we believe that these attacks are personal.
understanding the significance of these locations will be the key to identifying him.
this personal element strongly indicates a home-grown terrorist.
like the amerithrax case, we believe this is someone from the sci that's why you're here.
we think you may know him. He may be one of us.
these home-grown terrorists are myopic zealots,
ideologues that believe that their work is of the greatest importance.
he may have preached about the threat of an attack on america.
his coworkers would describe him as histrionic, paranoid, secretive.
all due respect, that's a little vague.
what are we supposed to do with something that generic?
sir, we're not finished yet.
he may have logged excess hours at work in the past weeks preparing for the attack.
we believe he's taken the full dosage of anthrax vaccines over the recommended 18-month schedule and had yearly boosters.
this guy has his on work space where he makes his product in privacy.
he also has access to large, expensive, industrial-grade equipment at work.
he's written about the threats of anthrax attacks, published papers.
yet he feels no one is listening. And that angers him.
now, he may have recently experienced some sort of professional humiliation, like be demoted or fired.
now, that would have been his trigger, the moment he decided to go rogue.
and he may have betrayed his loved ones to his cause.
he may be recently separated or divorced.
this is somebody who knows every detail of the 2001 anthrax attack.
and has talked about what that suspect did right or wrong.
he's watching the news very closely to see how the country reacts.
please share this with your departments. Thank you.
there's something i think you should see.
january '02.
classified hearing with the subcommittee on defense and homeland security.
Dr. Lawrence Nichols. He used to work at the institute. He left in '02.
he didn't leave. He was forced out.
5 people died.
if you ask me, we're lucky it was just 5.
we're lucky that whoever sent these letters used cheap porous envelopes a not a...
crop duster.
america's enemies are capable of wiping out entire cities.
and we are woefully unprepared.
I'm looking at your proposal. - Yes, sir.
every household needs gas masks and a 2-month supply of cipro for each resident.
every major city needs hospitals with bio-safety decontamination capabilities.
regarding the budget you propose for this operation.
anything short of 50 billion would be grossly negligent.
Dr. Nichols, you've got to realize how unrealistic that is. -Unrealistic?
we can't justify spending that kind of money on an attack that may not happen.
you people are in denial!
doing this would incite fear and panic among the public.
this country should be panicked!
we should live in utter fear of being attacked!
Dr. Nichols, please sit down.
I will not sit down.
we live in a time of war and wmd proliferation.
if you continue to be blind to our lack of preparedness, then americans will die,
and I will have no problem in pointing the blame at you!
committee said he was becoming unstable, fanatical.
which is why they removed him from Fort Detrick.
and railroaded from other prominent positions.
Dr. Nichols is well-respected in our community.
he believes in preparedness, not proliferation.
well, he obviously felt like people weren't listening.
maybe he was just trying to prove a point.
he had access, lost a prominent job, got divorced.
fits your profile. - We need to bring him in.
he works for a company called bio-design technology.
we subcontract them. They don't work with anthrax.
they deal primarily with the flu.
Dave, you and Prentiss go to his office.
Morgan, pull Reid from the hospital and go to his home.
we need to speak with Dr. Lawrence Nichols, urgently.
well, he's not in today. - We need to see his lab.
follow me.
clear so far. - All right, keep me posted.
this guy just had people over for a charity event last month.
we should probably take a look around anyway.
what's he doing in there?
when was the last time you saw dr. Nichols?
3 days ago.
that's before the bookstore.
Yeah, princess, what's up?
Yeah, we're here now.
sorry. What?
the lab is clean? You're sure?
all right.
they got nothing-- Reid.
Morgan, get-- get back! Get back!
get out of here! - What are you doing? What's wrong?
believe me, get back. - What's wrong?
Reid, open the door!
I'm sorry.
Morgan, how's Reid?
there's white powder in the room and the air was blasting.
get a decon team suited up.
secure a gray zone outside that door.
clean him up and get him in the ambulance fast.
I should have been right there with him.
Morgan, there's no time for second-guessing. What do we know?
Nichols is dead. Blunt force trauma to his head.
Reid thinks he's been dead 2 or 3 days.
well, then he couldn't have been responsible for the attack.
Reid too cipro today, so he's gotta be ok, right?
I don't know. It was precautionary.
it's not helping patients at the hospital.
Yeah, but they didn't take it until after they were exposed. Reid took it before.
Yeah, but we've never tested this strain on a cipro-ready subject.
we just don't know. - Reid.
Hotch, i really messed up this time.
Reid, we need to get you out and to the hospital.
no. I'm staying right here. - No, you're not, Reid.
I'm already exposed. It's not gonna do me any good to stop working the case.
he's already infected.
now, if Nichols created the strain, he may have also created the cure.
my best chance is to stay here, see if there's a cure, try to figure out who killed dr. Nichols.
come on, Hotch, say something to him.
he's right. His best chance is inside.
we're gonna get a suit and mask into you right away.
don't bother. It's not gonna do me any good. I'm already infected.
this thing killed the first 3 victims within hours, JJ.
Garcia, stop. Please. I-- I can't think about it that way.
he took cipro. He's got help. He's gonna be fine.
I'm not good at this part.
every time you guys go away, I...
I know you're in all kinds of ginormous danger, and all I can do is sit here in my bubble,
and i hope and I pray and I will my babies to come back to me...
I try to stay positive, but...
I don't know how to do this.
if you could do anything to keep your family safe, even if it meant breaking procedure, would you?
Yes. What procedure?
Reid, what do you see in there?
I see cages filled with dead animals.
I see signs of a struggle, probably before dr. Nichols was murdered.
equipment's missing. There's a large desk.
clutter all over the surface. But in the corner, there's a smaller desk.
it's organized, functional.
two different work spaces?
two sets of handwriting.
I'm looking at instructions on how to boil lab-grade broth, sterilize lab equipment, and transfer spores.
Nichols would know all that.
he has a partner, maybe even a protege.
go back to the b.a.u, try to figure out who this partner is.
Hotch, why don't you go? I'll stay with Reid.
funnel all the information you get to me.
Hotch says Nichols may have had a protege who turned on him.
I think we should tell the supervisor that this is about anthrax.
that's not our call to make.
screw protocol. Reid's in trouble.
if we tell this guy the truth, he might be able to help us.
look, i want to help Reid, too.
but our job is to do the best we can within our boundaries.
who's dr. Nichols close to here?
Oh, no one, really. He worked on his projects alone.
is he ok? - Does he mentor anyone?
not that i know of.
did he ever work on anything other than the flu here?
no. Why?
did he ever have samples of anything he shouldn't have had?
look, I really need to know what this is about before i answer any more questions.
we'll get back to you.
Hi, we're not home right now. Please leave a message.
it's-- it's me. Just calling to... See where you are.
give me a call. Ok? Love you.
Hey, Reid. - Gee, wow, no, uh...
no witty garcia greeting for me?
I need you to record a message for her in case anything happens to me.
Oh, nothing's going to happen to you. You're gonna...
brilliantly find out who did this and we're gonna treat this strain.
I hope you're right, but if you're not, I just
I really want to make sure that she hears my voice.
OK. Just, uh, give me a second.
are you ready? - Ready.
Hi, mom. This is spencer. I just, um...
I just... Really want you to know that I love you and I need you to know that i spend every day of my life proud to be your son.
prep the victim for transfer. - I gotta go.
Dr. Reid. - You look nice.
I haven't been in this outfit for a while.
how are-- how are the patients doing?
let's worry about you.
I actually-- I feel fine.
OK, if you feel any pain, I could give you something.
no, I-- I'd rather not take any pain medication.
we can at least make you feel more comfortable.
I am comfortable and I don't want to take any narcotics.
OK. Tell me how i can help.
I think the cure for this strain is in here somewhere.
well, shall I start here?
Dr. Nichols is a former military scientist,
which means he's most likely secretive and most likely a little paranoid.
he would have protected the cure and probably would have hidden it from his partners.
so look for something innocuous, something you would not suspect.
all right. - Hello.
how's it going in there, kid?
I've seen better days.
well, you got me and garcia.
Hey, Reid.
Reid, stick with me.
listen, Prentiss and Rossi don't think the partner was a coworker.
can you tell us anything else about him?
I... I've already been through everything.
come on, now, kid, i know you're not thinking straight, but the Reid i know wouldn't stop looking.
all right, all right.
I see a, uh, a framed photograph of dr. Nichols teaching.
I see a... I see a binder with syllabi.
course assignments going all the way back to the 1970s.
all right. So he kept a scrapbook of himself as a professor.
that tells us that he values himself as an educator.
a teacher.
I saw something earlier. I didn't
I didn't make a connection to it or to the partner, but he has a study on anthrax.
he has an annotated bibliography, table of contents.
it's formatted like a thesis and has writing in the margins in red ink,
like the way a teacher grades a paper.
now, Nichols wouldn't have let just anyone in here,
but he may have opened his lab for educational purposes, as a teacher.
so the partner must have appealed to him as a student.
Nichols is helping him with his thesis.
I-- I can look up local ph.d. students.
Yeah, check the sciences. Biochemistry, microbiology.
cross-checking with names of former employees or customers with grievances at the bookstore.
nothing, my doves.
listen to this, "this country is woefully unprepared."
every household should have a 2-month supply of cipro.
hospitals are in need of bio-safety level 4 decon wings.
that's verbatim to what we heard from Nichols.
the partner's adopted Nichols' views as his own.
the chapters are on setting up triage and mobile emergency rooms.
I don't think this paper was written by a science student.
it's about city preparedness and response.
so, garcia, check with students in the social studies-- public poy, urban planning.
hot to trot. There's a Chad Brown, school of public policy at u. of. m.
matches a Chad Brown, former employee at the book front.
that's gotta be him.
totally. He's been in the doctoral program on and off for 5 years.
nix on a steady job.
was slapped with a restraing order from his former girlfriend and has been arrested And released twice at protest rallies in d. c.
I'll tell Hotch.
kid, you did real good. Now get the hell out of there.
Bye. - Dr. Reid.
you said the cure would be hidden somewhere we wouldn't suspect.
what about Nichols' inhaler?
Chad Brown applied for a civilian position at Fort Detrick 4 different times.
his employment application.
he never got past the psych evals.
is it appropriate to sacrifice the lives of the few to save the many?
he answered yes. - Every time. Why he never got hired.
well, if he couldn't get into Fort Detrick, then being close to Nichols was the next best thing.
we talked to his thesis adviser.
in his proposal he was gonna write about the ease of making homemade anthrax.
and interviewed dr. Nichols just to prove his point.
get the address to pntiss and Rossi. - Yes, sir.
OK.
Yeah, they're hosing him down now. All right.
they're checking out Brown's house. - Go help Hotch.
Hotch has plenty of people helping him. - He needs you more than i do.
Reid, i'm gonna see you off to the hospital.
I'm about to get naked so they can scrub me down.
is that something you really want to see?
I'll check on you later.
take good care of him, please.
get this to the lab.
I hope you're right about this. - So do I.
Dr. Reid, did you cut yourself?
let's go. - Excuse me!
what's going on? Why is he in that suit?
ma'am, please stay back.
my kids are home. Do i need to get them out of here?
it's pretty bad. - Emily.
the house is infested with toxic mold.
and they can't start taking down the walls without protection.
but there's no danger to you. - Are you sure?
Yes, ma'am, I'm sure.
OK.
don't Emily me.
how are you feeling, dr. Reid?
my throat's a little dry.
but other than that, I feel... Flee...
feel fin. I feel-- I fleel fin.
Dr. Reid, ok. Driver, faster.
I've got a home lab in a shed in the back.
it's being secured as we speak. - And in here?
the house is totally clean, but there's something in here you should see.
I found a white powdery substance here and here.
I performed an instant field test. It's not anthrax.
it looks like he might be testing his dispersal device.
he's using light bulbs to carry spores.
he throws them on the ground-- anthrax bombs.
and i know where he's going with them.
Dr. Kimura called. Reid's in trouble. - What do you mean?
he got way sicker on the way to the hospital.
listen, - He's in respiratory distress.
he's with the people who can help him the most.
I need everybody's head here right now.
OK, so, uh, we spoke to Brown's sister.
they've been estranged for years.
did she say anything about the park or the bookstore?
quiet hills park was where he proposed to a girl. She said no.
the bookstore's where he worked to put himself through college.
I guess he's bitter about not being promoted.
so both locations represent rejection to him. - So what's our next move?
Prentiss and Rossi found maps of transit systems at his house.
here we go.
Dr. Nichols wrote a classified study commissioned by the u. s.senate.
it simulated a mock anthrax attack on the d. c.train systems.
now, he emphasized the main line-- the red line as most vulnerable to an attack.
forceful tunnel winds, biggest crowds, highest mortality risk.
now, I deployed teams to every stop on the red line.
I don't think he's targeting the red line.
but you said he adopted all of Nichols' ideas.
wouldn't he want to prove this theory?
we also said that he chooses locations that are personal to him, ones that represent rejection.
what is the one place that's rejected him over and over again?
fort Detrick.
it'd be impossible for him to get in.
he wouldn't have to attack the fort.
he could go after the people that work there or on their commute.
the closest station to the Marc train is frederick.
get on the line to maryland transit.
but the study said the red line.
the profile says he's going to frederick. That's where i'm going, and i could really use your help.
no gas masks. Repeat, no gas masks.
rush hour crowd sees anyone in a mask, there's gonna be a stampede.
Morgan, i want you to stay aboveground and help the crowds.
I'm gonna go down by myself.
not a chance, Hotch. - Morgan, we're a man down.
if the area's infected, we can't risk losing both of us as well.
we are a team. We're gonna go down as a team.
Hey, lisa.
I haven't seen you all day.
locked up in level 3. - How did it go?
it's pretty fascinating stuff.
seal the exits and clear the station.
I've got it. Clear the train.
OK, I need everybody to listen up.
I am FBI. I need you to exit the train now.
Oh, my god. - What's happening?
please, everyone, through this far door only.
Chad Brown, don't move.
don't come any closer!
Chad, put the bag down.
far door. Let's go.
I can kill everybody here!
and i will kill you before you do. - No!
No! Weapons down.
general, what are you doing?
call your director. Order from the president.
the u. s.army is taking this man into custody.
general, the army has no authority here.
we do now. He helped create this strain.
he's the only one who can show us how it was made.
sir, he is a danger to the country.
he is an asset to this country!
and by presidential order, i'm taking him in.
sir, please come with me.
where? - Fort Detrick, sir.
you want me to go to Fort Detrick?
we need you, sir, please.
I helped create this.
you have to name it after me!
of course. Standard practice.
now, hand me the bag so we can go on our way.
are there any other samples present?
no. - Move in.
you understand why I had to show everybody how vulnerable we are.
what are you doing? General! General!
I can help recreate this for you!
so how did I do?
you were effective.
I can't believe it worked.
the profile said he needed validation, especially by someone from Fort Detrick.
well, I'll give credit where it's due.
I'm glad I listened to you.
we, uh, got our bullpen back.
look, I'm, uh...
sorry about "Emily-ing" you back at that house.
no, it's all right.
is it?
Hey, I toed the company line, didn't i?
do you think people would be better off knowing everything we've prevented since 911?
would it make them feel safer or more vulnerable?
you did the right thing.
Yeah, I know that.
I know it wouldn't have helped anything if that woman knew what was happening across the street from her and her kids.
I lied because it was my job, and I wanted to protect her.
so what's eating at you, then?
am I naive to wish that lying is never the right thing to do?
with this job... - Yeah.
sometimes, our job sucks.
Yeah.
and yet, next time I probably won't hesitate to lie again.
we got a lot of things to take with us to the grave.
Oh, so he ate the peas, too?
Yeah, he is a good eater.
I'll be home in about an hour.
you're gonna keep him up for me, right? Good.
I just really need to spend some time with him.
I missed him today. Yeah.
Hey, it's me.
I know it's late, but, uh, is jack still awake?
do you mind if i speak to him? Thanks.
Hey, buddy.
what are you doing up so late?
Oh, yeah?
right.
you're eating jell-o?
Hey, kid. Hey, doc. Look who's back.
is there any more jell-o?
not so fast. - What happened?
you're gonna be all right, kid.
and we got Brown. It's over.
how's Abby? - She's on the mend.
so are the 3 others.
you were right about where to look for his cure.
why was dr. Nichols making anthrax in the first place?
he was a brain scientist downgraded to working on the flu.
brown comes along asking for help on his thesis...
would have been more than happy to share his knowledge.
there was no indication that Nichols had any idea what Brown was planning.
his strain and its cure are getting locked up in containment at Fort Detrick,
with all the other bio-agents people don't know about.
really. What else do they have locked up in there?
NIC "Security is mostly a superstion. Helen keller.
it does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it."
Helen Keller.
911. What's your emergency?
ma'am, you need to calm down. - Yes, sir, we have units on the way.
please stay on the line with me and give me your full name.
stand by, charlie 2-5, I still have the complainant on the line.
911. What's your emergency?
ma'am, the police are knocking on the door right now.
911. What is your emergency? - Yes, that is a real police officer outside.
911. What's your emergency?
ma'am, you need to calm down and stop yelling.
Yes, sir, we have a unit on the way.
please stay on the line. Please give me your full name.
911. What's your emergency?
there's a dead body in the warehouse.
excuse me, sir?
there's a dead body in the warehouse in Crawfordville.
can you be more specific about the location of that warehouse?
west of Crawfordville highway, south of Woodland.
a dirt road.
do you have an address?
no.
Charlie 44, role to location of possible dead body.
is someone on the way?
Yes, but I need you to stay on the line with me, sir.
are you sure the victim is dead, sir?
he will be in a second. - Excuse me?
sir? Sir!
Charlie 44, we have shots fired now. I repeat, shots fired.
I'm not sure what's going on in there, but I no longer have contact with the complainant.
advise and use extreme caution.
this is charlie 44. We're on scene.
it's quiet out front. We're moving in.
10-4. Use caution. EMS is on the way, too.
eyes open, Ray.
state police!
state police! Open the door!
police!
you, in the chair!
stand up and let me see your hands.
last chance, man! Stand up!
lord have mercy.
do not blow dinner, Ray. - I'm ok.
I mean it. You need to outside, you go.
I said I'm fine.
this is charlie 44. You can cancel that ems out here, dispatch.
are you sure, 44?
Oh, yeah, I'm sure. This looks to be a successful suicide.
10-4.
what the hell.
got a light.
Oh, man, take a look at this, Tommy.
these women all dead?
doesn't say this one's every been found.
I recognize that name.
she only went missing 3 weeks ago.
this is 44 again.
uh, we're gonna need bosses, detectives, crime scene out here on the double.
Ah, hell, just...
send everybody.
tell me what the dress is about.
Hey, have a good weekend, JJ.
sorry.
there goes my beach house rental.
and my non-refundable Sin to Win weekend in Atlantic City.
sin to win? - Yeah.
and I always win big.
I didn't have any plans.
Hey, uh, these were just faxed to me.
I talked to a Tallahassee detective who's been working a missing coed.
Rebecca Daniels-- she went missing while jogging near the fsu campus 3 weeks ago.
who's this?
florida state police responded to an apparent suicide an hour and a half ago.
middle-aged male. Those are photos of him postmortem.
what's with the tattoos?
Yeah, he's covered in them, almost completely.
that's why they requested our presence.
the tattoos are portraits of previously missing women, with the years of death or the years the remains were recovered, anyway.
the tattoos correlate to faces on a wall next to the body, with information on the women going back 10 years.
Rebecca is also shown on that wall, but there's no image of her on the body.
the detective thinks that that may mean that she's alive somewhere.
he called in his own suicide, didn't he? - Yeah. How did you...
he staged all this.
no reason to put on a show without an audience.
tell them to leave the body where it is.
we need to see it exactly how he wanted it seen.
if this girl's still out there, the only one who knows where she is may be dead.
painter William Dobell.
Oh, this heat is brutal.
you know, it isn't so much the heat as it is the humidity.
at some point it doesn't matter how you look at it. It all sucks.
FBI? - Yes, sir.
Hi, John Barton, Tallahassee pd.
I'm the primary on the missing girl, Rebecca Daniels.
I got my files in the car if you need them.
I'm agent Hotchner. This is agent Rossi, agent Prentiss, Dr. Reid, agent Morgan, agent Jareau.
Yeah, we spoke on the phone.
Yeah, hey, thanks a lot for coming out so quickly. I appreciate that.
I've also confirmed that all the women are victims from around the southeast --
florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama.
and Rebecca's the only woman on the wall who's not represented on his body?
Yeah, she's the only one.
hope you have a strong stomach.
the chair was turned like that? This is exactly where you found him?
Yeah.
talk about staging. - Talk about ego.
there's also a couple boxes with journals or composition books.
they're filled with writing.
we haven't been through them yet other than to dust them for prints.
have you identified him?
we're working on it. Uh, we got a rush on the DNA and the prints.
he's cleared locally, but it's gonna take some time to get the national records.
what about property records?
talked to the owner.
she said she rented it a couple weeks ago to a quiet, normal-looking guy named Bob.
he said he wanted to store some equipment, and he paid in cash.
they're always normal.
no lease? - Uh, month to month, no.
out here in the boonies you don't get a lot of, uh, record-keeping types.
especially when it comes to cash transactions, I'll bet.
he's no kid, yet the missings go back only 10 years?
as far as I could tell. - Late bloomer.
you see this a lot, uh, these guys killing themselves?
most serial killers who commit suicide do it in prison after they're caught.
JJ, gather as much information about the prior victims as you can.
morgan and Prentiss, take the journals.
Dave, you and Reid, the tattoos. See if he left any clues about where Miss Daniels might be.
you think there's a chance she might still be alive?
it's probably better not to speculate.
may I take a look at the case files you have on Miss Daniels?
Yeah, yeah, no problem.
he was on the phone with dispatch and then, boom.
must be what, 15 feet?
consummate overachiever.
right. Right.
why is it when men kill themselves, items everywhere, but women don't leave a mess, like they were never there?
women worry about who has to clean up. Men don't give a damn.
JJ, what have you found?
the earliest clipping is from 10 years ago, and they're in order, oldest to newest.
Brenda Carlyle first, Rebecca Daniels last.
that was thoughtful of him.
one victim a year for 10 years straight.
each girl's remains were recovered in a well-traveled wooded area.
strangled, repeatedly sexually assaulted, and then about a week later, another woman goes missing.
did the new abductions happen before the previous body's been found?
no, never. - So he has a year-long cycle.
he uses them up and he gets a newer model.
but he won't take another girl until the last body's been found.
he's telling a story and he can't start a new one until the old one's over.
look at that. At the turn of the 16th century, rose tattoos were put on men who were sentenced to death.
Really? - Yeah. If they escaped, it served to identify them.
but now roses pretty much symbolize pure love.
pure love. Right before he kills them.
Hey, have you read "the illustrated man"? - Nope.
Oh, it's amazing. It's a collection of short stories by Ray Bradbury, based on the metafictive device of a man who's covered in tattoos drawn by a woman from the future.
at nighttime, the tattoos come to life and tell a story. It's pretty awesome.
these do tell a story.
Oh, you want to see something?
a space in the tree.
and there's no date on that one.
why would he leave that space blank?
maybe this guy's just a psycho.
if it were that simple, we'd all be out of a job.
what's up?
our man here was a prolific journaler.
with teeny tiny handwriting.
he probably had counseling at some point when journaling was part of his therapy.
that's what we were thinking.
And?
and, uh, well, you know, the two of us, it would take us like 3 days to read all of this stuff.
you guys owe me.
it's no wonder no one has ever connected these cases.
they're from different states, different jurisdictions.
it's probably no accident. He knows the system.
why kill himself now? He wasn't on anyone's radar.
something changed. Let's gather everyone.
so what do we know so far?
he wanted the police here. He wanted us to see all this.
he was definitely a sadist. From what we saw, his journals were graphic and meticulous.
covering himself with his victims' likeness is methodical, possessive.
he'll always own them.
and the suicide shows commitment.
he's organized and compulsive. The crimes are on an annual cycle.
computer printouts on the board, they were all printed on the same day-- 2 weeks ago.
that's when he rented this building.
and proceeded to move everything into it. It's a history of his crimes.
so he did all of this in 2 weeks.
he got away with it for 10 years. He could have kept going.
but he decides to end it all and hand everything to us.
that's it--everything. Everything. - Reid?
everything. His body, the tattoos, the clippings, the printout, the journals.
he moved it all into one room. He wanted us to see all of it.
see all of him-- his work--the women, he put them in chronological order.
he's screaming,"look at me." - We all got that.
no, but think about it. If you take a step back, it sort of makes sense.
it's just a confession. A giant, flashy confession.
what would we say if an unsub turned himself in to the police before they were even onto him?
that he was trying to hide something. - Or someone.
he made a mistake-- in his third book. I almost missed it, but then I caught it.
I thought it would take longer, but today was the lucky day.
"she almost walked right by, almost missed her completely, but at the last moment, we found our latest guest."
we. - He has a partner.
he put everything in this room so we wouldn't look further, wouldn't dig even deeper.
if he has a partner, he's still out there, and he's got Rebecca Daniels.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I was calling out, but I guess your music was too loud.
are you all right? - I'm fine. It's all right.
Juliet Monroe? - That's me.
that's for you. If I can get you to sign here.
thank you very much. Sorry about that. - It's fine.
have a great day, now. - You, too.
ma'am.
my dearest love, by the time you read this, I will have gone.
our life together has brought me more joy than a man like me thought he could ever know.
my first wish would be to take you with me, but since you are in our home readying yourself with the next chapter of our life --
to care for and raise our beautiful child, my last hope is that you finish what we started.
please. Please.
just let me go home.
this is your fault.
this is your fault.
please.
what's she doing down there?
she's trying to keep the media from running the story right now.
but wouldn't that help us get it out there, put some pressure on the partner?
but if the partner didn't know about the suicide, he might dispose of Miss Daniels and disappear.
if anyone can stop the media from running something, it's JJ.
so let's profile the partner.
we know that the unsub was a dominant personality, an alpha.
can any of you guys think of a case where a dominant unsub committed suicide to protect a submissive partner? - No.
so the partner must be an equal in some way, or at least not a competitor, not somebody that he needed to feel dominance over.
maybe it was someone he cared about?
it would be hard for a sadistic psychopath to care about anybody.
which would make the partner all that much more important to him.
what about the tattoo artist? He couldn't have done those by himself.
maybe that's the role for the partner. - It would certainly make him important.
what the hell does any of this have to do with Becky?
I mean, isn't there something we should be doing, damn it?
detective, may I speak with you for a moment?
so we have until the evening news--6 P. M.
how much do they know?
Oh, the troopers told them everything.
agent Rossi, please tell me you called because the case is over and I can erase this freakity-freak off my otherwise uber-delicious desktops.
long way to go, kid.
I am into epidermartistry as much as the next gen xer, but this guy.
Eesh, I'm just glad he's not breathing the same air as you, my fine furry friends.
agreed. What have you found out about tattoo artists down here?
that the State of Florida requires licensing for all skin illustrators, but--and I am not going to elaborate on how I know this.
not everyone in the body art lifestyle goes through official channels.
all right, we'll start with the legit ones and see if anyone recognizes the work.
I shall send the list to your pda. - Thanks.
Epidermartistry?
only a girl can fill that empty energy.
look, I'm sorry I popped off. I'm just a little worked up.
I've been over the Rebecca Daniels case file, your reports.
do you know her? - What?
is there a personal relationship?
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
you've referred to her twice as "Becky."
I did?
and nowhere else is she referred to that way. It's always "Rebecca."
now, if there's something that's gonna cloud your judgment, I need to know about it.
no. I don't know her.
then what is it?
look, I've... I've been doing this a long time, and...
it usually just washes right over me, you know, people killing people, depravity, you know?
as long as you make it home at night, right?
but this one... Her parents...
they're just such good, decent people.
she seems like an amazing girl, and...
it's all.
sometimes it's just too much.
you take it personal.
stupid, right?
caring about a victim, personalizing them, can only be stupid if it's reckless.
don't worry about me. I'm good.
all right. Let's go and try to bring her home.
it's like 110 out here and it feels like a refrigerator compared to their warehouse.
how's reid doing?
it doesn't even seem to faze him.
he's just sitting there in a corner turning pages.
Yeah, he goes to another place when he reads.
I've got the addresses of the major tattoo parlors in Tallahassee.
that work is pretty detailed. Someone might recognize it.
you want to go check these out with me?
sounds fun.
Hey, so, uh, I got a few more hours out of the media.
well, we'll take what we can get.
Prentiss and Rossi are going to check out some tattoo parlors.
is he ok? - Yeah.
did you ask him about calling her Becky?
he'll be all right. - Well, I hope so.
because we still have no indication that this girl's even alive.
I wasn't able to tie up all the loose ends.
you would have known what was happening.
so now it's left for you.
wait for night and take it to the water.
the animals will do the rest.
this guy killed all those women?
looks like it. And there's another one missing.
then he killed himself?
Yeah, he did. - Good. Sort of a public service.
I guess that's a good way of looking at it.
we send it to the M. E. 'S office in Tallahassee. You sign it?
I'll take care of that, later. Thanks. - Thanks a lot.
you sure it's ok to move the body?
well, there's no reason not to anymore. We've seen this guy's show.
have you ever seen anything like this before?
like what? - Everything.
the, uh, suicide, the clippings, the journal.
I think it's pretty safe to say that no one's ever seen anything like this.
man, this is beautiful work.
it's a body suit? He's completely covered?
pretty much. - Yeah.
the illustrated man. - Second time I've heard that today.
the book? - Reid mentioned it.
everybody in the body art world knows that story.
you said this dude killed himself?
did he, like, gash his wrists open or something?
the tattoos--could you recognize who did this?
I wish. I'd hire this dude in a heartbeat. This looks free-hand.
trust me, free-hand portraiture is pretty gnarly to do on skin, man.
did he shoot himself? Because none of these pictures have a head.
can you tell if the same artist did these?
it looks like it. But they weren't all done at the same time.
some of the inks are newer.
you know, if I saw the body, I'd probably be able to tell you more.
how about these?
these are a lot of portraits. What do they mean?
that's what we're trying to figure out.
wait. That doesn't fit.
what doesn't?
there's something under the rose there.
looks like... A cross? A big one.
where? - Inside the rose.
and the work is sloppy. See that? They put the rose over it to cover it up.
Yeah, I see that. - Yeah, that wasn't done professionally.
more like it was done in jail.
if he did time, that would explain how a 50-year-old unsub doesn't start killing until he's 40.
this dude's a killer?
and why rapists become killers after they've been in prison.
they learn not to leave a witness.
Garcia can track this through the biometric recognition program.
so, there's, like, no chance of me seeing the dead dude, right?
none.
Hey, P. G., I'm gonna send you a photograph of a tattoo.
you know, that empty space on his back makes him exactly like "the illustrated man."
I thought he was covered completely. - In the book.
in the movie, there's an open spot on his back, so you can see the future.
Rossi and Prentiss think he may have done time - and that one of the tattoos may have been done in prison. - That's a good bet.
I've got Garcia running everything through the biometrics database.
Biometrics?
Yeah, it catalogues all the prison inmates and their tattoos.
they have detailed photos of every one on every inmate.
what happened? - Shut up.
please, sit down. You can tell me.
we can sit down and-- we can talk about this. We could...
wait! Please. Can we please talk?
my dad has to be so worried about me.
don't you have a father?
I don't have anyone anymore. - Please.
just let me go before he comes back.
he's not coming back.
what? Wait.
you can let me go. - What?
it's just-- I won't tell anyone what happened.
I promise I won't tell anyone.
you won't tell anyone?
I know you're afraid of him, too.
you're not going to tell anyone because you're never leaving this room alive.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I was never afraid of him. I loved him.
I would do anything, I did anything for him.
he was my masterpiece.
you're bleeding!
she will pay with her life.
once I'm done with this newest guest, I'll be able to fill in the last space in my art collection.
the last space... Last space... Last space...
no, no, no, that's not right.
Hey, guys, it isn't the only blank space. - What do you mean?
the spot on his chest where we assumed Rebecca's portrait would go-- - yeah?
in the journal he talks about filling in the last space, - how once he does that the artwork will be complete. - And?
it isn't the only blank space.
in his back, in the middle of that tree is a giant open spot.
why would he talk about completing the artwork when he hasn't?
I need to see the body again. - I'll go with you.
I'll call the M. E. And let him know you're on your way.
I ran the covered tattoo through the morpho tracking system.
tell me you got something, babe.
Emily, don't get ahead of my dramatic telling.
I analyzed color, design, and texture.
there's a 95% chance it is from one of 4 major institutions in the northeastern prison system.
the string of missings began unbroken from 2000, so I went back from that year, found 53 similar tattoos on forearms.
of those 53, 10 were released prior to 2000. Thank you and good night.
you are amazing.
of the 10, any convicted rapists?
4.0
do any of them trace back to Tallahassee?
none.
so ultimately I have nada. - Bob.
Oh, the guy, his name, the guy who rented the property, just Bob.
OK, ok. I have a Robert Matthew Burke, convicted in 1991, 8 years for rape, released October of '99.
and the missings began in 2000.
Garcia, remind me never to try to hide from you.
perish the thought, mon ami.
Hotch, we got the name.
the unsub's name is Robert Matthew Burke. - Burke?
you know him?
Burke. Yeah. I know the name. Damn it!
he's a registered sex offender. He's an ex-con out of virginia.
he got a traffic ticket near FSU the night Rebecca disappeared. He's one of my suspects.
I--I went to his apartment, I don't know, a couple times in the past 3 weeks to try to interview him, but I could never catch up with him.
did he know you were looking for him?
well, yeah, I talked to him on the phone.
he's scheduled to come down for an interview and a DNA swab on Monday.
that's what changed. He knew it was only a matter of time before you caught up to him.
and he wasn't about to go back to prison.
do you have his address? - Yeah.
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
something's wrong. Something's wrong.
unchain me.
unchain me and I will help you.
I am not stupid.
your baby needs help.
wait! You can't-- the collar.
you help me and I'll let you go.
OK. Ok. Ok.
damn it.
if these tattoos are a fetish, what enjoyment does he get out of the ones on his back?
he can't even see them.
you know what? There's something here. I can feel the raised ink.
do you have a black light scanner? Thanks.
right there. Feel that.
Yeah, what is that? - Thanks.
I've read about this. Tattoos put on with invisible ink so that no one can see them.
Oh, man.
can you, uh, turn the lights down? Thanks.
look, there's one over here, too.
they're all connected to the faces.
they lead to the blank spot. - What is that?
it's an embryo in a womb.
the partner's a woman, and they're having a baby.
Oh, my god!
there's more blood. I don't know what I'm doing.
it won't stop. It won't stop. I don't know what to do! It won't stop. I don't.
help me.
do we know if she had the baby yet?
the tattoos have dates, the embryo doesn't.
dating is prominent in the tattoos and the journals and they're calendrical in their abductions.
it's hard to believe their baby's birthdate wouldn't be exceedingly important to them.
then she's probably still pregnant.
well, he didn't live here with a pregnant woman. This is a males-only sro.
no, she has to have a house, anyway.
how do you know that?
they kept these women for a year each. It wasn't in a one-room apartment.
everyone get back here. We need to update the profile and narrow the search.
push. Push. Push! Push!
it's almost-- it's almost there. Just keep pushing.
I can't. - I see the head!
one more time, that's it!
please... Tell me it's a girl. - What?
it can't be a boy. Please.
you have a son.
it can't be a boy.
it can't be a boy. Get it away from me.
you need to take him. - I don't want it.
he'll hurt me like they all do.
I felt for sure I was having a girl.
no, no, no! You gotta get me out of here.
you have to get me out of here!
help us! Help us! Help us!
it's ok.
the partner being pregnant can help us.
we should have Garcia try and find her through doctor visits or medical records.
he basically lived off the grid, which means she did, too.
judging by the photographs of what they did to the victims, it's safe to say they live in isolation.
we've seen his hatred for women, and yet he teams up with her.
what kind of woman could change him?
you think they met in prison?
Garcia already went through all of that. He had no female visitors.
what about prison staff, doctors, religious volunteers?
we went through a long list of all the vendors who were there during his incarceration.
none of them resurfaced in Tallahassee.
what kind of a woman would go to a prison to fall in love with a rapist?
someone vulnerable, emotionally fragile, drawn to violent men.
someone in her life made her that way. Classic abuse cycle.
what if that's who she was there to visit?
it's worth a try.
my sweet.
Hey, you know the visitor logs from the prison we looked at?
still have them at the ready. - Ok, great. I need you to check dates for me.
were there any women who visited another inmate while Burke was there but then suddenly stopped visiting when Burke was released?
OK, let me hit you back.
it's ok. It's ok.
I can't help you!
it's ok...
rev your engines, guys.
Juliet Monroe went to visit her father in prison once or twice a year from '92 to '95.
what was he in for? - Rape.
and she was his primary victim.
he raped her and she still went to visit him every year?
she's repeating the cycle she grew up with.
Yeah. And she went from visiting him once or twice a year to once a month from '95 to '97.
when Burke was serving his time for rape.
Yeah. And then she increased her visits to once a week all through '98 and '99, until they stopped completely in October of that year.
that's when he was released.
and if you want me to slip you some convincers, she owns a house in northern Florida.
Garcia, get us the address.
Rossi and I will take the front. Take the side.
go.
in here! Please help. In here! In here.
the baby. The baby.
she's--she's dead.
all right, give me the baby. Give me the baby. I got him.
you're gonna be all right.
help me.
Becky, are you ok?
I just want to go home. I just want to go home.
Yeah, you're going home, honey. You're going home. It's ok.
so, I talked to your parents. They're gonna meet you at the hospital, ok?
is the baby ok?
Oh, yeah, he's-- he's in another ambulance.
what's gonna happen to him?
Hey, don't you worry. We're gonna take real good care of him, ok?
ma'am, we should get going.
take care. It'll be ok.
she gonna be ok?
I wouldn't bet against anybody who survived what she did.
how about you?
Oh, yeah, you know, nothing's gonna affect me.
you know, we wouldn't be here if you hadn't worked the case as hard as you did.
how's that?
it would have been an easy thing to miss a routine traffic ticket in the area she disappeared.
you kept the pressure on.
you cleared 9 homicides and you brought Becky home.
it's impressive work, detective.
Thanks.
3 cards, please.
3 cards for the lady.
and I'm gonna take one card.
one card. A straight or a flush, Dr. Reid, what are you trying to fill in?
well, considering the odds of filling in an open-ended straight with one card are 5-to-1 against, while a one-card flush draw is more like 4. 5-to-1, I guess you'd say if I was smart, I'm drawing to a flush.
I think I'm gonna go all in on this.
so, are you?
am I drawing to a flush, or am I smart? - Either.
well, I'm-- I'm provably a genius, but, uh, actually, I was drawing to a full house. 8s over 6s.
I always forget you're from Vegas. - Yup.
Ooh, I'm sorry, not so fast. I, too, have a boat.
jacks over 3s.
you drew 3 cards to a full house? That's like 100-to-1 against.
97-to-1. Looks like you're out.
Hey, Prentiss. Sin to win.
I'm sorry, what? - Come on, now, I gotta know.
what the hell is a sin to win weekend in Atlantic City?
Derek, I have a tremendous amount of respect for you, but there's some questions that if you have to ask them, it means you probably couldn't handle the answer.
there is a whole other side to that woman.
I never lose. - A whole other side.
I know environment plays a bigger role than genetics when it comes to determining a child's future, but that baby, I mean, both the parents.
how many other serial killers had kids? - A lot.
Manson has like 10 or 11 children.
Albert Fish had 6. - Gary Ridgeway had a son.
Fred and Rosemary West had 7 children living in the home where they killed 10 women.
including one of the children.
OK, so, the baby's gonna be ok? - Most likely. If he grows up in a good home.
loved, cared for.
good.
gandhi said, "I have seen children successfully surmount the effects of an evil inheritance."
that is due to purity being an inherent attribute of the soul.
good job today, Brenda.
Thanks, Keith. This was a great haul.
Franklin, ALASKA
Yeah. They were really biting today. It's been a while.
why don't you head back to town. I want to put the rest in the smoker.
I'll drop you off.
no. I could do with the walk.
get home to your wife.
you sure? Lisa wouldn't mind if I waited for you.
I'll be fine. Go home.
all right, well, don't stay too late, all right?
OK. I'll see you tomorrow. - All right. See you.
is anyone there?
is anyone there, Brenda?
right. 'cause the homicidal maniac hiding in the shadows is really going to answer you.
stop messing around. It's not funny.
Oh, it's you.
I thought someone was...
JJ, that's not the point.
well, are you gonna call him?
maybe.
Mick rawson is an arrogant, oversexed, egotistical...
hot british dude with a sexy accent, badge, and gun.
just your type.
you know what? I don't even get you sometimes.
it wouldn't go anywhere.
you don't know that.
I know our work schedules.
OK, you know what? Will and I make it work.
Oh, no.
I know. I know. I know. Don't say it.
but when you see what's in here... And it's not my fault.
they were calling to me, I swear. And they were all on sale.
and when you think about it, that means that I am helping the economy, which is more than I can say for you guys,'cause no one else has bags.
Yeah. Please tell me all of those aren't for my son.
they're not. - Good.
this one is for Kevin.
what? It is my duty as a fairy godmother to spoil the child.
and Henry is finally old enough to be fun when opening presents.
I'm not taking them back.
give me my coffee and no one's gonna get hurt.
Oh, uh, half-caf extra shot venti, 2- pump nonfat, hold the whip caramel macchiato.
next stop, xanadu.
Oh, wait. Xana-don't.
time to go to the bau, ladies.
maybe I should get a cat.
sorry to ruin your night. - What, are you working on wife number 4?
I see you people way too much.
let's get started.
all right. Anchorage field office is asking us to investigate a series of murders in franklin, Alaska.
there's 3 people dead in less than a week.
for a town with a population of 1, 476, that's fairly significant.
it's their first murder investigation on record.
who are the victims?
uh, Jon Baker, a hunter.
Dedaimia Swanson, a schoolteacher.
Brenda Bright, the first mate on a fishing boat.
there's a new victim every 2 days. - Any connections?
unfortunately, in a town this small, everyone's connected.
different kill methods.
it says the first two victims were both shot with a rifle, but brenda bright was stabbed twice with an arrow?
are we sure it's the same guy?
all 3 victims were found in heavily trafficked areas.
the unsub wants them found sooner than later.
jon Baker's body was left exposed to the elements, but the two women were buried under mounds of trash. Why?
it could be a sign of remorse.
cover their bodies so he doesn't have to face the reality of what he's done.
or he thinks that the women are trash and he's just placed them where he thinks they belong.
well, we can't be sure of anything yet.
Franklin is an isolated fishing community that's been hit really hard by the current economy.
add to that a series of unsolved murders and everyone's on edge.
the local sheriff's out of his depth.
and Alaska hasn't handled a serial investigation since Robert Hansen in the eighties.
we'll fly out tonight. Everybody can sleep on the plane.
Garcia, I need you with us. - sir?
I've tasked a satellite uplink and it's your job to keep us connected.
Yes, sir.
this town's already on the brink, and if this pattern continues, we've only got another day until the next murder. Let's finish this fast.
"is but the background and theater of the tragedy of man." John Morley.
this guy's all over the map. Crosses sex and race boundaries.
he changed his kill method. It says to me he's disorganized.
yet there weren't prints at any of the crime scenes, and he isolated his victims.
wearing gloves and making sure there aren't any witnesses... That's a no-brainer.
but what concerns me is the evolution of the kills.
evolution?
well, he started with easy prey.
jon Baker was in his mid sixties.
it's relatively low-risk for a first-timer.
Dedaimia Swanson was in her early fifties.
she wouldn't be that difficult to overpower.
but he didn't have to overpower either one of them. Both victims were shot.
which is my point exactly.
he killed them both from a safe distance.
but Brenda bright was younger, more athletic.
she would have been able to put up much more of a fight, so why not shoot her, too?
that supports the disorganized theory.
maybe he didn't get what he wanted from his first two victims.
Brenda Bright was an attractive woman.
he used an arrow, but he didn't shoot her with it. He stabbed her.
I think we all know what that means.
when we land in anchorage, there'll be a float plane to take us to Franklin.
when we get there, Morgan and Prentiss work the crime scene.
we need to know exactly how he ambushed his victims.
Reid and Rossi, the bodies. Find out what you can there.
JJ and I will work victimology. And, Garcia, town records.
find us something we can use. - Of course, sir.
I should let everybody know that reception in the area is unreliable at best.
I'm giving everybody satellite phones for communication, and I've already preprogrammed all your digits into speed dial.
guess who's lucky number 7.
welcome to Franklin. I'm deputy Flack.
are these the docks that Brenda Bright was working the night she was killed?
Yes. - All right, we'll get started here.
agent Hotchner? - Yes, sir.
sheriff rhodes. - Very nice to meet you.
good to meet you, sir, ma'am.
so I cannot tell you how grateful I am that you all could come.
the people here are really starting to act up.
I'm afraid our little town's a bit of a powder keg.
where would you like us to set up, sir?
you see, there's not much room at the station because that's also the post office.
but I have made arrangements for you to work out of Carol's tavern, which is right over there.
thank you. - Well, thank you. Appreciate it.
it's pretty isolated out here. How do you get basic supplies?
float planes bring grocery and hardware deliveries on a weekly basis, and fishermen and hunters provide the town's meat supply.
I'm Craig Ramey. You all the fbi?
what gave us away?
you're sure packing an awful lot of stuff for a fishing trip.
I'm not going fishing.
getting the hell out of dodge before it's me or my wife put in the ground.
did you know Brenda well?
everyone did. She was sweet.
she's pull a haul just as good as any guy on these docks.
as soon as I get my house boarded up, I'm heading out.
suggest you do the same, Susan.
I can't say that I blame him.
with what's been going on, I'm surprised more people aren't trying to leave.
this is Keith Graves. He was with Brenda the night she died.
Mr. Graves, did you notice anything out of the ordinary the night of the murder?
no. I offered to wait for her, but she insisted I head up to town without her.
what were you two doing that night?
we finished for the day. I left.
she stuck around to clean the fish that she wanted to take home.
she usually walk home alone? - Yeah.
Brenda said that walking was good for the soul.
how far is it into town?
about a half a mile.
the unsub could have waited for her anywhere.
appreciate your time.
sheriff asked me to keep everyone on ice till you got here.
still, I can't believe someone from Franklin would be capable of this.
what convinced you she was stabbed with the arrow instead of shot?
upward angle at the point of entry.
he would have had to been shooting from beneath her.
there wasn't much left. Forest got to him first.
I found urine on the remains. - Urine?
I thought it was from the animals who scavenged his body, but I got the lab results back this morning.
the urine was human. Is he marking his victims?
only found it on Jon. Both the women were clean.
jon was shot 3 times. The unsub grazed him twice and then hit him in the head.
Dedaimia Swanson was only shot once.
the first kill shows hesitation, uncertainty.
he wasn't confident taking the terminal shot.
it was either accidental or spur of the moment, but the second kill, he only needed one shot. He's progressing quickly.
were you close with the victims?
an occupational hazard when you're the only doctor in town.
I delivered Brenda. Never thought I'd outlive her.
look at the cuts on her torso.
they're shallow and non-penetrating.
not necessary for the murder. - You know what? These were made postmortem.
he's playing with the bodies, experimenting with his methodology.
someone incapable of remorse.
we're dealing with a psychopath.
have you determined whether or not she was raped?
I didn't even think to look.
your report says the assault occurred here.
that's right. There was a trail of blood coming from that direction.
I don't see any blood.
we covered it up. - You contaminated the scene?
we had to. We've got a rabid bear in the woods.
it's been ripping smaller game to shreds.
a creature like that smells blood, he'll come into town, no hesitation.
OK, you said the other two victims were found similar to this?
jon was found on the edge of the woods.
Dedaimia was up by crest falls.
it's a popular hiking route.
who would know their routines? - Everyone.
cup of coffee, Jace?
what are you doing?
trying to make this place a little less analog.
sorry. I forget my hacker jokes aren't funny.
my name is penelope.
I'm the one who doesn't carry a weapon, aside from my biting wit.
and my job includes combining my kick-ass systems with your sheriff's department database to get the skinny on your neighbors and you.
or you could just ask us what you want to know.
I mean, isn't it better to just talk to us directly than look up our dirt secretly?
no. Because in my experience, the information superhighway never lies and people do.
your name would be? - Josh.
my mom Carol, she owns the place.
it goes like this. Here we are.
joshua Beardsley, age 23, born right here in Franklin, ak.
moved to Anchorage for middle and high school.
majored in hotel management at Seattle u.
and you moved back home a few weeks ago.
perfect timing, huh? I come home, people start dying.
that's when I check your criminal record.
and you, my friend, are clean as a whistle.
what does that even mean? - No idea.
no dirt, anyway, so, I guess I'm safe, then?
for now.
those two got into it last night.
Bob here, he's our newest resident, so, uh, tom figures, well, this is the guy who's doing all the killings.
he decides to smash him over the head with a bottle of booze.
look, I don't know what to do.
have you thought about having a kind of town hall meeting where you get everybody together and talk about the facts of the case?
the town's too spread out.
I mean, everybody's doing what they can just to get by, you know?
sheriff, I know people move to these remote locations to be left alone, but what happened last night is gonna keep happening, and people are going to start taking matters into their own hands.
well, I can keep order in my own town, but people around here, I mean, this is Alaska, man.
they do what they want.
he's already experimenting with his victims.
he violated Brenda bright with an arrow.
and he's inciting panic.
people who have lived here most of their lives are packing up to leave.
can you blame them?
we have a psychopath whose hunting ground is a town of 1, 400 people.
most of them grew up learning to kill animals and start fires.
it sounds like your basic survival skills.
no. They're hunting skills.
think about it. The marksmanship, the urine... It makes sense.
the urine makes sense?
it's a hunter's trick. You urinate downwind to keep the animals away.
he tried to preserve Jon Baker's body so it would be discovered intact.
all right, so we've got a psychopath with hunting skills who knows the routines of everyone in town.
how are we supposed to keep everyone safe?
sheriff, I suggest you institute a curfew until we have the unsub in custody.
nobody out after dark.
I'll have one of my deputies patrolling around the clock.
Garcia, how's it coming with town records?
I've run everyone who's been printed through codis. Nothing's come up so far.
I'm gonna pull an all-nighter, finish going through the town records.
should have background checks by sunrise. - Good.
the rest of us should get some sleep, start fresh in the morning.
I've got 4 of the upstairs rooms available.
uh, 4? - come on, that's the best we can do.
your team is double the size of my department.
I'll see you in the morning. - good night.
it looks like we'll have to double up. - I'm not sleeping with Reid.
dibs.
what do you mean, you're sharing a room with Morgan?
Oh, you're jealous.
jealous? Why? Because you're bedding down with a...
muscle-bound, modern-day 007?
mm, he's more like Jason Bourne.
Oh, what's there to be jealous about?
he took the floor.
OK. Just... Just make sure he keeps his weapon holstered, ok?
why are you up right now, anyway? It's so late.
actually, it's early. I just got to Quantico.
damn time zones.
Hello?
frak.
Oh, come on, baby.
come on, come on, come on.
nice one, Garcie.
look at me. You're gonna be ok.
my name's Penelope. You're gonna be ok. You're gonna be ok.
just keep looking at me.
help! Help! Please!
somebody come help here!
someone is hurt! Please!
his name's Craig Ramey. Fisherman.
morgan and I met him this morning.
he was packing up to leave.
he's accelerating his schedule.
we should have had another day. Why change that?
Ramey was pretty vocal about wanting to get out of town.
if the unsub knew that, he could have struck early to prevent his target from getting away.
there has to be more to it than that.
he brought the body to the tavern we're staying at.
he's telling us that he's not afraid of us. He's gaining confidence.
he switched to a hunting knife. Looks like a jagged edge.
there's more physical damage, too, like he was cut open.
I won't know until dr. Johnson does an autopsy, but I'd be willing to bet he took a piece of the victim with him.
what kind of piece?
it's hard to say, but judging from the location, I would guess liver or spleen.
he was alive.
what?
he was still alive.
baby, there's nothing else you could have done.
I felt him leave.
he was there one second, and then... Just a body.
I'm really sorry that you had to see all of that.
Derek, I...I didn't see, I was in it.
I was sort of used to seeing horrible things from the safety of my screens every day, but this was...
right there.
why didn't you go and find someone before you ran out there?
because when I got shot, I remember thinking the last thing I'm ever gonna see in this life is the man who killed me, and I couldn't let that happen to him.
he had to see something good before he died.
you ran right towards the unsub. You could have been killed.
I know that. Don't treat me like I'm the victim.
all right. I'm sorry.
I want to ask you a couple of questions, all right?
no. I... I told you everything I saw.
you said the man's face was mostly in shadow, but there was also a lot of blood on it.
you might have seen more than you actually realize.
no. Cognitive interviews, breaking someone's death down to a science and statistic...
that is your world, Derek, not mine! - Penelope!
I will help from mine. - Penelope!
Derek, let her go.
will you look after her, please?
Yeah, of course.
was Garcia able to give you any new information?
she's given all she can. - This guy's taunting us. He's one step ahead.
I think you're giving him more credit than he deserves.
it's like emily said on the plane, he's all over the place.
the victimology's inconsistent, the methodology's evolving, the first kill was sloppy, hesitant, and unplanned.
it was an accident, but it triggered a sexual response. He got off on it.
and he knew then and there he had to kill again.
he learned how to get the job done more efficiently.
Yeah, but why the organs?
consumption typically indicates a desire to keep the victim with them.
he's having trouble letting go. We're probably looking for someone with severe abandonment issues.
it'll be light soon. Let's get everybody together and go over what we know.
we're looking for an emotionally immature male, probably in his mid to late twenties, who suffered a traumatic loss.
now, this loss could be anything.
death of a parent, separation of a spouse, a loved one who moved away.
something that made the unsub feel abandoned and alone.
he'll have extensive hunting experience.
the bodies were buried not because of remorse, they were buried to protect them from wild animals.
his familiarity with the victims' routines suggests the unsub has lived here for most of his life.
he also has extensive knowledge of the landscape and surroundings.
so we should split up and cover the town.
focus on younger residents with a history of petty crimes and assaults.
you should look in their trash, fireplaces, even in laundry.
look for signs of bloody clothes or even cuts and bruises.
one of the victims may have gotten in a good blow or two before they died.
bring in anyone who seems to have something to hide.
the unsub has already broken patterns, so he could strike again at any time.
sheriff, you and I need to look at the school, talk to the teacher, see if she remembers any students exhibiting early signs of homicidal tendencies.
let's move.
Dedaimia was only one month away from retirement.
I can't believe she's gone.
we're very sorry for your loss.
I need to ask about your former students.
do you remember any of them enjoying hunting too much, so much that it worried you?
all the boys around here like it too much.
they have competitions to see who's the better shot.
this would have been extreme.
do you remember anyone who might have tortured animals or played with them before he killed them?
does that sound like someone you know?
I've never seen anyone enjoy hunting as much as Joshua Beardsley.
he's the tavern owner's son? - Yeah.
the youngest boy in town to bag a deer.
that's all he ever talked about.
he hunted something nearly every day.
he was born and raised here.
he returned a couple of weeks ago after his dad died.
how old is he?
23? - Sure.
we need to talk to him. - All right.
thank you.
what's this about?
the strike was above the gut.
it keeps the meat from spoiling. Isn't that right?
on a deer, maybe.
doubt it'd be the same for a human.
but then he did something interesting.
he took the victim's spleen.
now, tell me, why would he do that?
no idea.
let's stop playing games, Joshua.
answer my questions and maybe I'll believe you.
it's a native hunting tradition, isn't it?
eat part of the kill.
gain the life force of your prey.
not many people know that.
I'm not many people.
where did you learn to hunt?
bagged my first deer when I was 7.
that's pretty young.
my dad taught me how to live off the land.
I ate the heart of my first kill.
that proves you're a true hunter.
so, you, um, enjoy hunting?
it's my favorite thing to do.
then would you say you take pleasure in the kill?
doesn't everyone?
actually, no...They don't.
what do you think? - I'm not sure.
he fits the profile, but he's acting like a man with nothing to hide.
the attack cycle's accelerating. He should strike tonight.
and if he doesn't, we know we've got our guy in custody.
and what if he does?
look, I hate to say it, but half this town matches most of your profile.
what are you guys working on?
Hotch asked if we'd go through Garcia's background profiles, try to find a link between Joshua and the 4 victims.
you find anything?
they all had hunting licenses.
needle, meet haystack. Yeah, we need the big guns.
ripped and ready to rumble.
uh, maybe you should sit this one out.
no, jaje, I'm ok.
put this bastard where he belongs.
joshua Beardsley? - Yeah. We think he's our unsub.
no, he's not.
he fits the profile. Abandonment issue triggered by his father's recent death.
Reid... - Hunting experience, - Experimentation with animals. - Reid.
you arrested my son?
we brought him in as a precaution.
I'm telling you, it's not him.
what makes you so sure? - Because the unsub ran away from me.
of course he ran. He knew you were fbi.
but Jjoshua knowsI'm a techie. He knows I don't carry a weapon.
if he was the unsub, I'd be dead right now.
how can you be listening to any of this, Steve?
you know Joshua would never do this.
look, I never thought any of us were capable of doing this.
but 4 people are dead, Carol.
you don't know him. He's a good boy.
he's a good boy who recently lost his father and it's a lot of emotional stress.
it's been tough, but we're coping. He's doing fine.
why did he move back to town?
I needed him here to help with the inn. I can't handle it on my own.
and how did that make him feel, having to drop everything and move back home?
he didn't do this. - we need to be sure.
I'm sure. I'm his mother.
Carol, it's one night.
if nothing happens, you pick him up in the morning.
wait a minute. You said the unsub has abandonment issues.
and Craig Ramey was leaving town, right?
Yeah, he couldn't wait to get out of town.
OK. Uh... Let's see.
Dedaimia swanson was retiring in a month.
she was moving to florida. - What about the other two?
un, Jon Baker just bought property in Fairbanks, and he and his wife just separated.
she just filed the divorce papers.
well, welcome back, red delicious.
take a bite out of this.
so far, 3 of our victims were on the fast track to getting out of town.
and let's see... Connect 4.
Brenda just accepted a job in Seattle.
anyone else look like they might be leaving town?
um... I got one. Kat Allen.
she was accepted to the summer honors program at the university of Bloomington.
she currently works as a waitress at big john's coffeehouse.
Penelope, you are... - So ready to go home.
we're looking for Kat Allen.
I'm Kat.
can we talk?
it was completely unexpected.
never been married. I'd given up on ever having kids.
do you mind my asking who the father is?
a guy I met on a cruise.
he doesn't want anything to do with her. But I do.
I want to be able to give her a good life, so I'm going back to school.
did you tell anyone that you were leaving?
Yeah. A couple of people.
uh, I don't know... My mom. My boss.
we're going to need you to come with us.
Why? What's this about?
it's just for tonight. It's for your protection.
damn it.
the neighbors saw the door open, called it in.
he went from ambushing people in public to home invasion.
that's a pretty big change in m. o.
this one's personal. It's angry.
her intestines are splayed out everywhere.
Yeah. And the blood on her face is smeared, not splattered.
he played with the body. He mutilated her.
if this guy's killing people leaving town, why didn't he attack Kat Allen?
because we had her in protective custody.
he couldn't get to her, so he moved on to another target.
a target who broke her routine.
Carol was scheduled to be at the tavern tonight.
how did the unsub know she was here?
he was stalking her.
he chose Carol for a different reason.
Why? What's changed?
you guys finally realize I'm innocent?
joshua, please have a seat.
more questions? You serious?
I'm telling you, I didn't do this.
we know that, son. Please, sit down.
what's going on?
Josh, the...The killer struck again last night.
Ohh, god. Who did he get?
why are you guys only telliling me this?
Where's my mom?
no. no. No. No, no, no, no.
no, no, no, that's impossible.
she... She was just here. I... I just talked to her!
I'm sorry, Joshua. She's gone.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No, no. You... You're lying.
I wish we were.
I need to see her. - not right now.
you don't want to think of her that way.
joshua, we know you need time to mourn, but the fact of the matter is, the man who did this is still out there, and we think that you can help us find him.
you had me locked up while she was...
I could have helped her.
if you had gone to her, there's a good chance you'd both be dead.
now we need your help. - Why me?
the murders began when you returned to town.
now, up until now, he's only targeted people who were trying to leave, but for some reason, with your mother, it was personal.
the pressure's on. The fbi is here.
in that situation, a serial killer wants to finish what he started, - he goes after the true target of his cause. - Personal?
can you think of anyone who had a grudge against her? Anyone at all?
how about anyone with a grudge against you?
no. No. Everybody loved her.
the man that we're looking for has severe abandonment issues.
now, can you think of a time when you or your mother left somebody, maybe like a bad break-up or a fight that ended a friendship?
did your mother ever take anyone in at the inn who had family problems, maybe someone who had been kicked out or lost someone unexpectedly?
no. No, no, no, no, there was nothing like that.
uh, listen, can I go see my mom now?
Josh. Josh, you need to let these people help.
no, I need...I need to see my mom.
well, let's have someone take you. - It's ok. I know the way.
did you see his behavior shift from wanting to help us to wanting to leave? He's lying.
because he knows who the unsub is.
I got one of my deputies tailing Joshua.
if he does something stupid, we're gonna know.
there's got to be a connection we're missing. Garcia, anything?
their lives have been torn apart, figuratively and literally, and I can't find anything.
try again.
I'm hacking into his college database as we speak.
maybe there's something about his life in Seattle I may have missed.
good. All right, why Carol? Why the mutilation? Why the overkill?
mutilation?
you said you found the remains of mutilated animals in the woods from a rabid bear?
that's right. - Did you take pictures of them?
of course we did.
we documented everything for identification.
we'll need to see those pictures right away.
sheriff, we need to adjust the profile. - What do you mean?
these animals weren't mutilated by a rabid bear.
someone did this.
you mean a person. - An animal wouldn't have left so much.
we should have seen it before. It's homicidal triad 101.
we said the kills were all over the map.
the unsub lacks sophistication and shows immaturity in his kills because he is immature.
he started with animals because that's what he was taught ever since he was a child.
and when he got bored with animals, he moved on to more challenging prey.
people. - Your unsub's a teenage boy.
the boy we were talking about before, he wouldn't be a former student, he'd be a current student, a teenager who loves to hunt.
I only have two teenagers right now. Both of them are girls.
go ahead, Garcia.
I found something uber weird.
in Joshua's college application essay, he talks about the impact that being an older brother had on his life.
I thought he didn't have any siblings.
he doesn't, and yet he's talking about how hard it was to leave him behind when he moved to anchorage, to leave him unprotected.
Thanks.
was there a student that Joshua may have taken under his wing before he moved away?
someone you may have suspected was being abused?
Oh, my god. - What?
Owen porter. He's not a student anymore. He's home-schooled.
joshua and he were attached at the hip when they were younger.
I've been called out to the porter house several times.
domestic disturbance.
Owen and his mom always covering for the dad.
let's go. - Thanks.
talk about abandonment issues.
Owen was left victim to the abusive hand of his father.
Joshua's return probably derailed Owen's mental stability.
add to that the accidental shooting of Jon Baker and he snapped.
he got off on that first killing. - He had to do it again.
so he targeted people trying to leave town.
in his mind, when people leave, he gets hurt.
and he resented Carol for taking Joshua away, so he killed her to make sure he never left again.
where would he go now?
we're surrounded by waterways and mountains. He could be anywhere.
Mr. Porter, is your son at home? - What's it to you?
turn that off.
did you know? - Don't know what you're talking about!
not for sure. Not until last night.
he came home covered in blood. - He's not here. But the window's open.
it's not the first time you've washed blood out of his clothes, is it?
don't answer them, Martha! - Sit down and shut up.
I promise he will not lay a hand on you again.
no. It wasn't the first time.
Mrs. Porter, I understand you're only trying to protect Owen, but you can't anymore.
he's always been different. He's not like us.
when he was a little boy, he used to go out into the woods and come home covered in blood.
why didn't you tell anyone, Martha?
how could you just sit there and do nothing while people died?
how did Owen react when Joshua was sent away?
he wanted to leave, too.
but I couldn't let him.
Mrs. Porter, do you have any idea what social isolation does to a child?
I was afraid of what he might do if he ever left here.
we knew. We knew what he was.
we've got a problem. - What is it?
joshua managed to shake deputy stiller.
and someone reported a hunting party going into the woods.
Oh, god.
they're hunting Owen.
listen. That way. Go.
you have him? - No. He's moving too fast.
looks like he's circling back towards town.
maybe we'll get lucky.
did they just shoot him? - They would be shooting if they weren't close.
let's go.
do you know where he's headed?
was there a place he went to be alone?
a hiding spot when you were mad at him?
hiding spot. How the hell are we supposed to know?
if you know, you need to tell me.
I'm trying to help him. There's a mob out there, and if they find him, they're not gonna turn him over.
they're gonna take justice into their own hands.
if you value your son's life, you need to help me.
Martha, don't!
lake lafayette.
he and Joshua built a fort there when they were younger.
you'll need a boat upriver to get there.
hold on, guys.
Yeah, hotch, what's up?
OK. I got it. There's a new plan.
he's heading for the harbor.
Owen, put the gun down. - Drop it, son.
who do you want to take your chances with, us or them?
drop the weapons and back away!
can't do that, agents. The boy's coming with us.
it's not happening! - Back down, Keith. We're in control now.
what are you gonna do, Steve? He's 16.
send him back to juvey so he's out in 2 years?
he killed my mom. - He killed brenda.
he needs help and he will be held accountable for his crimes.
accountable? 5 people are dead.
why'd you do it, Owen? Why'd you kill her?
you left me behind. - You killed my mom!
she sent you away!
you left and you didn't come back.
8 years and I never heard from you again.
please, just let us take him in.
sorry. I can't. I know what you're saying is right, but I can't do it.
I'm terribly sorry for your loss, but please just put your guns down so no one else gets hurt.
are you kidding? You're outnumbered and outgunned.
who do you think has the higher ground here?
I'm pretty sure we do!
no... What are you... What are you doing?
we can still take him!
it's over, Joshua.
he killed my mom.
I know, and I'm sorry.
you shot him?
he'll live.
it sucks, doesn't it? - What?
just knowing that we couldn't have done any of this without you.
Yeah, pretty much.
I'm proud of you, Penelope.
despite everything that happened, you came back...
and you got the job done.
the sight of blood used to make me run away.
and two nights ago I ran towards it.
it means you're changing into someone stronger than you realize.
you cared enough to risk your own life to try and save someone else.
Yeah, but...
what's the difference between being strong and being jaded?
I'm scared, Derek.
I don't want to lose who I am just so I can do this job.
we are in one of the most beautiful places on earth.
I know you see that, don't you? - Yeah.
then we have nothing to worry about.
it's who you are, baby girl.
you see the beauty in everything and everyone no matter where you go.
that part of you is never gonna change, and I won't let it.
I don't need you to protect me. - Tough.
I think I'm gonna stay on the job a little while longer. - Yeah?
how much longer?
every day of my life.
I kind of love you, Derek Morgan.
I kinda love you, Penelope Garcia.
Ralph w. Sockman said, "nothing is so strong as gentleness, and nothing is so gentle as real strength."
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, make no mistake about it.
Sean Wallace is a gang-affiliated criminal who only cares about himself and his fellow street thugs.
sure, it's breaking and entering now, but what's it going to be next?
first-degree murder?
your honor, I believe that the pursuit of justice is never a waste of time.
but in this case, there's no question, that man is guilty.
the prosecution rests.
do me a favor, um...
close your eyes for a moment.
go ahead.
now, I want you to erase the image in your head that you have of my client.
now, imagine an 8-year-old Sean Wallace.
he's scared and alone, starving for love and attention.
now, I know you're thinking, where's his family?
well, let's start with his mother,
a local prostitute who spends most of her time either in bed with strangers or shooting up drugs.
then there's his abusive father, currently serving 25 to life.
and finally, the aunts and uncles who only saw Sean as a monthly paycheck.
so, with no other place to go...
Sean turned to his peers on the streets.
you can open your eyes now.
it's true, Sean fell victim to the gang community, but it was not because he wanted to.
it was because they were the only family that he'd ever known.
ladies and gentlemen, instead of pushing this young man further away, let's do what every loving parent would do.
let's help.
I urge you to impose probation and community service in lieu of jail time.
let's--let's stretch out our hands, as it were, and help this young man to his feet.
defense rests.
the jurors can retire to the jury room and begin deliberating.
court is adjourned.
so what do you think my chances are?
well, how many of the jurors smiled at you?
Like...4, maybe.
then I'd say they're pretty good.
Yeah, I thought I could get out early, but I just got caught up in some paperwork.
so, anyway, I'm heading to the car now.
be home soon. Love you.
what the hell are you-- that's my car!
what the hell are you doing?!
I'm calling the cops.
911. what's your emergency?
Yeah, there's a guy smashing up my car.
what's your name, sir?
sir, what's your name?
and where are you right now?
I'm outside Marty's near Vernon.
wait a minute, he's running away.
sir, stay where you are.
Mr. Westbrook, do not pursue.
do not follow him.
sir.
sir, are you still there?
Hello?
Mr. westbrook?
Yeah, i'm--i'm here.
officers have been dispatched.
sir?
help is on the way.
Oh, there you are. - I'm sorry. The traffic was horrible.
Chris had a double shift. Megan needed to be dropped at a friend's.
Hotch said we're dealing with an abduction?
sadly, yes. 12: 34 this morning.
Boston defense attorney Jack Westbrook was abducted from a convenience store parking lot.
that's precise. Who called it in?
he did. He was on the phone with the 911 operator when he was taken.
cute shoes. - Hey, thank you.
sir, sir, are you still there?
Hello? Mr. Westbrook?
Yeah, i'm--i'm here.
officers have been dispatched.
did you just hear that?
Garcia, can you enhance the audio at the end?
I think I can. Give me a second.
you got him?
someone else besides the unsub was there.
he had a partner. - Have there been any ransom demands?
no, nothing yet.
this guy's made a lot of enemies.
he was the lead prosecutor responsible for putting away key members of the buccieri family.
it wouldn't be the first time a convict targeted an attorney.
just last year in Texas Eric Lyle Williams killed two prosecutors.
Yeah, according to this, they weren't all high profile.
he prosecuted or defended everyone from drunk drivers to gang members.
so basically, half the criminal population of Boston could be holding this guy for ransom.
and the other half could be victims or family members of the criminals he defended.
I hate to be the odd woman out here, but isn't it possible he was just a victim of opportunity?
I mean, he was in a sketchy area after dark.
true. But you heard the recording.
the attack on the car was most likely a ruse to isolate him.
it says target to me.
it's been over 12 hours since he disappeared.
if the motivation was revenge, he could already be dead.
is anybody there?
I need some help.
I'm down here.
please, let me out of here.
you ready to come clean?
come clean? What are you ...
you've got the wrong person.
why are we even listening to this crap?
we should just kill him.
no, no, no, no. please.
not until we get his confession.
I swear, I don't know what you're talking about.
please! Just let me go.
can't do that, Mr. Westbrook.
not after we went through the trouble of getting you here.
besides, we're just getting started.
how you react is yours.
all right, let's go over victimology.
Jack Westbrook's life reads like a practice guide to being perfect.
graduated first in his class.
went on to be the a.d.a. in several rural counties.
his marvelous track record caught the attention of the higher-ups.
within 6 years he was in the boston big leagues.
4 years ago he made a 180, went from prosecuting criminals to defending them.
I wonder why.
he may have been tired of dealing with all the politics.
or he wanted better pay.
a.d.a. s with his kind of trial experience are in high demand.
looks like jack isn't all dollar signs.
it says here he worked with a number of nonprofits and even took on several pro bono cases every year.
he seems to have checked all the boxes in his personal life, too.
he and his wife linda have been married for almost 7 years.
they're expecting their first child in january.
did you think i was joking when i said his life was so pristine?
even someone this perfect is bound to have some skeletons in the closet.
it says that he and his wife did a lot of moving around in the area.
they never stayed in the same place more than a couple of years.
well, that makes sense. guy seems pretty ambitious.
all the relocating could have been for better job opportunities.
Yeah, or they feared retaliation from the people he put away.
last year alone, he won 33 of the 35 cases he defended, giving him a 94% success rate.
we should concentrate on the 6%.
he could have made promises and not delivered.
agent Hotchner. thanks for coming out.
detective. this is agent jareau.
welcome. right this way.
we've got units posted at both the victim's workplace and residence.
brought in some extra manpower to work the phones in case these guys try and reach out, like you suggested.
good. thank you.
you and your team can set up over there.
is that mrs. westbrook?
hasn't said a word since she came in.
you know, this type of stress can't be too good for the baby.
hopefully she has better luck than i did.
I'm jennifer. i'm with the fbi.
I want to ask you some questions about your husband. is that all right?
Yeah. - great.
um, you know what? why don't we go somewhere a little more private.
have a seat, please.
can i get you something to drink?
no, thank you.
may i ask how far along you are?
7 months.
a boy.
I have a son. he's 6.
can you tell me about the last time you spoke to jack?
at lunch yesterday.
I missed his call last night.
he said he'd gotten caught up with paperwork.
had he always worked long hours?
for the most part.
I read that the two of you moved around the area a lot. why?
his job used to make him paranoid.
I can't tell you how many times he changed his phone number.
but once he got the new job things were different.
how so?
well, for the first time he wasn't looking over his shoulder.
he was defending the underdog.
we--we finally settled down and bought a house.
and that's when we decided to start a family. i'm sorry.
Hey, it's ok. i know, this is very hard. ok?
your husband's last purchase was from a convenience store.
he bought flowers.
were the two of you celebrating something?
he won.
whenever jack won a case, he brought me flowers.
it was his way of thanking me for dealing with the long hours.
please, please find my husband.
please.
look, whatever i did to you in court, i'm sorry.
I know the system isn't fair.
I was just doing my job.
please, just...
tell me what you want.
whatever trouble you're in, you know, i can help.
let's just talk this through. i can fix this.
you really have no idea, do you?
No!
No!
i--uhh--i don't!
just tell me--tell me what it is you want.
is it money?
is that what this is about?
name your price.
you can't buy your way out of this.
you know, my wife knows i'm missing.
so do the cops.
you let me go, i won't say a word.
we ain't worried about the cops.
let's get this show on the road.
take off your clothes.
what?
Why? - cause i said so!
get the camera ready.
what are you waiting for?
I said take 'em off.
I'm not taking off my clothes.
you know...
maybe i didn't make myself clear.
what are you doing, man?
showing this punk what's gonna happen if he doesn't follow directions.
just--just do what he says, all right?
the amount of detail needed to pull off this abduction was pretty sophisticated.
Yeah. not only did they lure him to the lot, but they managed to dodge most of the security cameras.
well, at least we know one of the unsubs is a football fan.
him and the 636, 479 other people in this city.
what?
not you, too?
I googled it.
wow, they definitely did a number on his car.
and saved the real torture for him.
that's a lot of rage.
if it were a body, we'd say this was complete overkill.
you think these guys knew jack personally?
it's sure starting to look that way.
how long has jack westbrook worked for your company?
almost two years.
had he received any threats recently?
not to my knowledge.
in fact, his clients love him.
can you tell us about his current caseload?
well, they're pretty straightforward.
DUIs, grand larceny.
nothing that would have had this type of blowback.
what about the cases he lost?
they were both minor.
family disputes.
one client was sentenced to probation, the other to anger management classes.
his wife mentioned that he'd been working a lot of overtime lately.
what was he working on?
well, he just wrapped a case yesterday, got the kid off with community service.
Jack didn't work overtime for that.
if fact, he hadn't billed any overtime in months.
most days, he was off the clock by 6: 00.
if westbrook wasn't at home or in his office, where the hell was he?
what are you willing to bet that those roses had more to do with guilt than romance?
I am made of cream. give me your coffee.
Hey, baby girl, listen, you're on speaker.
Reid and i think westbrook might have been having an affair.
and the plot thickens.
Yeah. i need you to dig deeper into his personal life.
he's definitely hiding something.
look at hotel invoices, large cash withdrawals, anything that screams mistress.
Oh, if he is sharing his sugar, i will let you know.
Thanks, mama.
right now we can't rule out anything.
it's probably not the first time this guy flew into a jealous rage.
I'll put together a list of recent domestic disputes.
you're on speaker, garcia.
I have searched hither and down for something that will connect mr. can't-keep-it-in-his-pants with this mystery woman.
I came up with zilch until i went back two years ago, and i found an llc in jack's name.
here's where things get super suspect.
that company has been wiring money to cover the rent of an apartment downtown, and the name on the lease is...
winner, winner, vegetarian dinner.
sounds like the perfect place to keep a mistress.
any leads on the mystery woman?
no. there's no texts, there's no emails, phone calls, nothing.
whoever she is, he's keeping her really well hid.
clear.
clear here.
check this place out.
talk about a man cave.
he spared no expense.
how much did all this cost?
at least 10 grand.
Jack has an odd sense of romance.
I expected more from the guy.
this place wasn't just for romance.
it was his escape.
No!
No! stop!
stop!
how does if feel to be on the other side?
I don't know what you're talking about!
what's wrong? you don't like the attention.
why are you doing this?
come on.
smile for the camera.
now you know how matt felt.
what did you say?
stand up.
stand up!
remember us?
you think he's in shock?
it doesn't matter.
he'd better start talking soon.
don't you think you've had enough?
what if he doesn't start talking?
he will.
trust me.
Yeah, but what if he doesn't?
then what's the plan?
we bring in reinforcements.
I don't get it. why get married if you're just gonna cheat?
well, some people think the grass is greener on the other side.
yeah? what about you?
Oh, my grass is plenty green.
we need to deliver the profile.
did you-- did you find him?
have a seat.
Oh, god.
is he ok?
in order to help find your husband, i need to share some difficult truths.
will you please tell me what's going on.
we have reason to believe your husband's a pedophile.
what are you talk-- what are you talking about?
we found evidence that - would allow us to charge jack... - this has to be some sort of mistake.
with multiple counts of both production... - you're wrong!
and possession of pornography. - no! no!
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god.
which is why we believe jack westbrook used his position of authority to exploit the trust of his young victims.
he targeted those who would be afraid to come forward, because they'd been ostracized from society due to their crimes.
much like jerry sandusky, who hid behind his nonprofit foundation for underprivileged and at-risk youth in order to abuse young boys over several decades.
we found hundreds of photographs of westbrook's victims in his apartment.
based on the dates on the photos, our unsubs are now in their 20s.
we think his past came back to haunt him.
the unsubs are either former victims or family members seeking revenge.
which is how they came in contact with westbrook.
they've been carrying the burden of the victimization around with them for years, and it's affected their ability to find and maintain employment as well as serious relationships.
this mutual trauma would cause them to isolate themselves from others, yet draw them close to one another.
their shared revenge motive makes them extremely dangerous and volatile.
this is a deeply personal mission, and it's been fueled by years of shame, hatred, and anger which has finally exploded to the surface.
keep i mind the unsubs are also victims.
why go after westbrook now, after all these years?
it's likely something pushed one of not both of the unsubs over the edge.
it could have been an anniversary or a recent death.
and understanding that trigger will be key to preventing these two from crossing the line between kidnapping and killing.
thank you.
dude, you should have seen your face.
it wasn't funny, chad. you guys could have just called.
why, so you could send our call straight to voicemail again?
and where were you yesterday, huh?
I had to work. - yeah, bull.
will one of you tell me why the hell i'm here.
go see for yourself.
you ok?
Yeah. yeah, i'm fine. let's just get this guy.
how did linda take it?
well, at first she defended him, insisted he would have never jeopardized his career.
but by the end, she was asking me if i knew any good divorce lawyers.
what about out here? anything?
Yeah. we've been able to put together somewhat of a timeline, dating back to early 2000.
this guy literally has hundreds of cases involving young boys.
the list of victims and potential unsubs just keep getting longer.
moving around wasn't for safety.
it was because he wanted to avoid getting caught.
westbrook didn't touch these kids.
what are you talking about?
Linda was right.
he wouldn't have jeopardized his career.
he's smart.
these boys are too big of a risk.
think about it.
Sandusky didn't molest his players.
he kept it separate.
we need to be looking for a place that's completely unconnected, that wouldn't have affected westbrook's career.
how do you know?
just trust me, i know.
you know i hate this guy just as much as you do, but this is insane.
you have to let him go.
let's just get his confession, then go straight to the cops.
and say what, you kidnapped a man and held him prisoner?
we have to at least try.
I mean, we owe it to matt.
you think any of this will make a difference?
it won't.
I'm out of here.
you're not leaving.
how much have you had to drink?
this is payback, for what that perv did.
he ruined our lives.
you're right!
what i did, it was wrong.
but that was in the past.
I swear to you, i've changed.
say it again to the camera.
look, i'm married.
I even have a kid on the way.
please, just let me get back to my family.
what if he's right? what if he has changed?
I can't believe you're falling for these lies.
people like him don't change.
Hey, chad, take it easy.
the only way you're getting out of here is in a body bag!
what are you doing?
put the gun down, chad, all right?
stop! what are you doing?!
what are you doing, chad?
give me the gun! - no!
No!
the more we learn about westbrook, the less i want to save him.
this isn't about him, it's about saving his victims.
according to this, back in 2005, westbrook worked closely with a volunteer-run facility known as the sudworth place.
it's a halfway house for troubled kids.
Yeah, he's still pretty active with the organization.
he made a $5, 000 donation last year.
looks like he chaired numerous events and even hosted overnight field trips.
that would give him the isolation he needed to manipulate these boys.
holy moley.
last week, a former resident of the sudworth place, matthew jones, he committed suicide.
how?
uh...drug overdose.
when was the funeral, garcia?
yesterday morning.
it's no coincidence that later that night jack westbrook went missing.
Matthew's death must have been the unsub's trigger.
Yeah, this is about retribution.
Garcia, see who else spent time at sudworth place around the time matthew was there.
our unsubs will be on that list.
come on, chad, get up, man. this isn't funny.
he's dead.
you killed him.
shut the hell up!
Chad, get up!
What'd you do?
you saw what happened. it was an accident.
I was trying to stop him.
nobody was supposed to die.
Chad was gonna kill him.
which one of you is gonna be next?
shut up!
I need to think.
how far are you gonna take this?
where are you going? we all need to get out of here.
I'm not going anywhere until i get what i came here for, - and that's his confession on camera. - andrew, come on!
look where revenge has gotten you.
Chad is dead.
keep and eye on him.
wait, where are you going?
if he doesn't start talking, then we're gonna burn this whole place down with him in it.
I've got more 4-1-1 on matthew jones.
he was in and out of the sudworth place from 2002 to 2004.
he overlapped with 22 other boys.
look for guys with spotty work histories, mostly working odd or solitary jobs.
not enough. give me more.
they most likely would have stayed in the area.
OK. we're getting somewhere, sort of somewhere. i got 6 names.
Garcia, these guys went through a traumatic experience.
they would have stayed in contact with each other.
OK...
bingo. chad griffith, andrew ford, brian stiller.
according to social media, they have kept in contact.
only andrew and chad posted about matthew's death.
uh, andrew recently wrote about, quote, "bringing the monsters to justice."
Chad, not so much, quote, "i could kill him with my bare hands."
two different motivations.
one wants revenge, the other one justice.
I think we have our two unsubs.
what about the third guy brian stiller?
he works as a janitor at the harold street motel.
he has lived and worked there for the last two years.
you think he has anything to do with this?
we should talk to him.
say your name for the camera.
come on. this is the only way you're gonna get out of here alive.
do you have a death wish?
Andrew's gonna be back soon.
if you don't talk, he's gonna burn this place down with you in it.
none of this was my idea.
I know that.
they dragged you into it.
and now you could be facing manslaughter.
you don't understand.
Chad was gonna... - brian, brian, brian.
you're a good kid, i know that.
I always knew you were different.
I saw what no one else could see, not even your parents.
what are you talking about?
you weren't like the others.
even back then.
Oh, come on.
you knew you were special.
to be honest, you were my favorite.
the pizza and the video games.
I don't want to hear this.
remember i took you to see "harry potter"?
you loved those books.
I said i don't want to hear this.
you'd stay up all night reading... - stop! just stop!
look...
there's still time to get out of this.
there's already one dead body down here.
if i die, that makes two.
the cops will make the connection.
and guess who's taking the fall for it.
it won't be andrew.
he'll pin this whole thing on you.
I mean, after all, you're the one who killed chad.
Brian, look at me.
Hey, brian.
Brian, look at me!
you have to end this.
get me out of here...
and you and i can both go to the cops and we can explain this whole thing to them.
we'll do it together.
clear! - clear.
aaron, i think you might want to take a look at this.
you all right?
you did the right thing.
what's gonna happen to andrew?
I think you know what needs to be done.
you take care of him, i'll go deal with the cops.
but you said we'd go together.
just--just let me deal with them.
all right?
trust me.
you go home and you get rid of those keepsakes.
and make sure there are no loose ends.
what's that supposed to mean?
Hey, come on.
you thought i didn't know?
I've always known you and i were alike.
even when you were a little boy.
I saw that sparkle in your eye.
it's ok. it's ok, hey?
your secret is safe with me.
Hey, i found this.
what happened?!
he gave me no choice.
I checked the main office. brian wasn't there.
according to the schedule, he's supposed to be on duty.
it looks like brian picked up where jack left off.
according to the manager, he left in the middle of his shift.
she came to look for him.
wouldn't want brian to miss out on the fun.
the question is, are they aware of what brian's been hiding?
no doubt that would have ruined the friendship.
we can use that.
hand me the gun.
come on, man.
come on.
you should have stuck to the plan. why'd you get him out?
he swore he'd admit to what he did if i pulled him up.
of course he did, and you fell for it!
I tried, all right?!
come on.
let's just burn this place down like you said and pretend this never happened.
OK. thanks, hotch.
they found several photos of underage boys.
he'd been keeping their underwear as souvenirs.
what brian's done is rare.
statistically, very few victims of molestation become predators themselves.
we searched andrew and chad's apartment. came up empty.
spoke to a neighbor, said she hadn't seen them in a few days.
well, make sure you keep a couple of your guys back to patrol the area just in case they surface.
I'll get on it.
Hey, sweetness, tell me something good.
I did some snooping into chad and his bank account.
he's been regularly depositing checks from a vbh construction.
they have a site that got shut down due to permit issues.
guess where it's located.
right in the middle of the comfort zone.
must be where they're holding jack.
here's the address. - thanks, mama.
all right, ready?
that's the last of it.
FBI, don't move!
don't come any closer! i mean it!
put the weapon down.
what the hell are you doing?
where are jack and chad?
they're dead.
n-nobody was supposed to die.
Andrew, put the gun down.
can't do that. - listen to her, drew.
shut up, brian, i got this.
let us help you. - help us?
where were you when we needed you?
you have no idea what that man did to us.
we were just kids!
Yes, i do. - hey, i said back up!
just listen to me. just listen.
I'm putting this away kid, you don't want to do this.
just give me the gun.
and you have my word that i'll get you a confession.
who are you talking about?
westbrook is dead.
you just gotta trust me on this, man.
why would i trust you?
because the same thing happened to me when i was a kid.
what happened to you happened to me.
I'm not lying.
think about this.
this is the rest of your life, man.
you don't want to go out like this.
come on, look around. look around.
a confession's not gonna mean a damn thing if you're dead.
if you put that gun down, i can help you.
thank god you're here. andrew killed jack and chad.
what? - don't worry?
we know it wasn't your idea.
but we also know that you like to keep souvenirs.
Hey, what are you talking about?
you're under arrest for possession and distribution of child pornography. let's go.
Brian stiller, you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law...
I promised you a confession.
I didn't say it would be the one you wanted to hear.
our moral responsibility "is not to stop the future, "but to shape it.
to channel our destiny in humane directions and to ease the trauma of transition.
Alvin toffler.
we've only been gone an hour and two more of westbrook's victims have come forward.
you know what happened to me, don't you?
who told you?
you did.
the way you handled this case, body language, all of it.
look, you can tell me as little or as much as you want to.
but whatever happened...
I'm sorry.
it was a long time ago, callahan.
I get it.
how do you compartmentalize cases like these?
believe it or not, these are the good ones, knowing that these guys are locked up and that they can't hurt any more innocent children.
even though i know this stuff, i still worry about meg.
she's got you to look out for her.
she'll be fine.
speak of the devil.
Hey, sweet girl. how was your day?
it was great until mrs. peterson thought it'd be genius to give us a pop quiz fourth period.
so annoying.
well, life is not finals.
I know. i know. it's daily pop quizzes.
that's my girl.
Where's chris?
he's still at work.
OK. look, make sure you're home on time.
otherwise a search party's coming for you.
and make sure you text me when you land or i'll send one for you.
I love you.
love you, too. see you in the morning.
Yeah.
I still don't get the point of homework.
right. after 6 hours of school, the last thing i want to do is come home and continue the torture.
seriously, i mean, how often is america's next top model going to use geometry?
OMG, he messaged us back.
he is so hot.
could you imagine if he was your boyfriend?
he's asking for a picture.
well, how's my hair look?
wait, you're not actually sending him one, are you?
well, he's a senior. no big deal.
OK, if you're so worried, then take it with me.
so are you a Knick fan?
10 million a year they're paying Larry Brown.
you're from here?
no.
out of town?
suit yourself.
you sure this is where you wanna be?
did you hear me?
Walter Derbin, age 52.
his body was found in his cab in east Harlem.
he was blindfolded and shot once in the chest.
death was caused by knife stab through his ear.
it's the same signature as two other murders.
Rachel Holman, 24, found in her apartment 3 weeks ago on the Lower East Side.
and Kaveh Surrani, 30.
the police found him 2 weeks later in his painting studio in Hell's Kitchen.
different locations, different victimology.
it's possible we're looking for someone who'll hunt indiscriminately.
NYPD have any leads? -Guy's a ghost he kills at night. There's no witnesses.
is the NYPD feeling the strain?
well, they've withheld details so the press hasn't sniffed out a link between the murders.
with no discernable victim patterns, the killer's practically impossible to stop.
did you know the original zodiac killer actually continually changed his victims.
young, old, men, women, white, black.
exactly, and he killed for 30 years without ever being caught.
w. H. Auden said:
murder is unique in that it abolishes the party it injures.
so that society must take the place of the victim, and on his behalf, demand atonement or grant forgiveness.
this is not how I planned to spend a few days home in new york.
I'd kill for an afternoon at Barney's and dinner at Il Cantinori.
I'm looking forward to seeing New York.
you've never been to new york?
we've never had an unsub there.
I thought you were gonna talk to Reid about taking some vacation time.
what's vacation time?
Reid, it's a one hour flight.
well, if we have some time, I'll show you around.
it's 3 hour train ride, man.
OK, here's what we know. Blitz attackers are almost always male.
he got picked up in the pouring rain by a New York cabbie, so we definitely know he's not a brother.
the fact that he kills in a major urban setting without detection indicates he's highly intelligent.
how intelligent can he be?
and blitz attackers are textbook disorganized killers.
Yeah, but he brings along a murder kit.
blindfold, knife. How disorganized can he be?
we'll split up. We'll take the last two crime scenes.
in the meantime, let's talk about what we can agree on.
a blindfold likely means one of two things.
the unsub might blindfold them initially if he's unsure of killing them and wants to avoid detection.
exactly.
but since we know the cab driver couldn't have been blindfolded when he drove the unsub, we're looking at reason number 2.
blindfolding a victim suggests the unsub feels remorse.
doesn't want his victims to look at him...as he kills them.
what's in that building?
nothing. It's been vacant for a couple of months.
this train goes express after midnight. It doesn't even stop here.
he picked this spot beforehand.
his last fare was logged in an address on Church Street.
you have any idea what's there?
church is an entry point for Brooklyn.
there's a dive there where the cabbies stop for coffee before the overnight shift.
explains how he got a cab.
this guy's definitely not disorganized.
Rachel Holman. "Change of address" card.
she just moved in. Hadn't even filled out yet.
so she probably didn't know her neighbors, and they weren't likely to check in on her.
Nope.
I also found this.
it's a printout of A. A. Meetings in the area.
she was starting a new life.
Hey, you guys, check this out.
the cops' theory is that she was home and the unsub broke in through the front window and surprised her.
but look. This is the gunshot to the chest.
this is the knife to the head.
so then after she was shot, she tried to run away from him toward the door.
exactly.
he was already in the apartment when she got home.
the hallway's the only room in the apartment with no windows.
no one could see him, so he just waited patiently.
so...
she comes home...
and she opens the door...
and she walks in the hallway.
she walks down,and then...
bam,he shoots her right here.
but she tries to run away...
and he's on her.
so why didn't he just shoot her again?
why stab her and break the blade off in her head?
well, there are a number of possibilities.
through the ear is the softest path to the brain.
snapping the handle's also common in prison shankings.
break it off, other guy can't pull the blade out.
what's the other possibility?
lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris drove ice picks into their victim's heads and broke off the handle.
it's possible our unsub is sort of a, uh, serial-killer groupie.
so is this guy an ex-con or some nut job with an Amazon account?
this particular unsub presents a mixed profile.
no offense, then what good is it?
the profile's just a starting point for narrowing down the suspects.
for instance, the fact that the unsub shoots his victims first suggests that he needs a quick and effective means of controlling the situation.
it's possible that he feels he can't overpower his victims.
it could be that he has a physical problem.
or that he's not confidant just because he's small.
we now know he has a high degree of organization.
that coupled with the fact he hunts at night means he probably has a steady job.
so we're looking for a small, angry white guy with a day job?
maybe it's Wilson.
cut it!
no, that's all right. That's all right. You're right.
there's a lot we still don't know, but we do know this:
these are not blitz attacks.
they're too controlled.
these are absolutely executions.
an unsub's signature is his own extremely rare combination of M. O. and ritual.
an unsub kills to satisfy an inner need, and he'll continue killing until that inner need, which is based on a ritual, is lived out perfectly.
because reality never lives up to fantasy, this becomes an impossibility.
in other words, he's not gonna stop killing until we catch him.
OK. Hit the streets and keep your head on a swivel.
thank you very much.
Hi. Jennifer Jareau. We spoke on the phone. Detective bennett.
hello. -Agent Hotchner.
so I spoke to your point man.
I reiterated how important it is to keep the crime scene details under wraps, but it would go a long way if it came out of your mouth, too.
you got it.
if this guy's who we think he is, we're talking terror like New York hasn't seen since Son of Sam.
may I help you?
are you ok?
so this is where terror starts.
how'd they find him?
night janitor. -He see anything?
no, but he remembered a parishioner who was here earlier.
so there's a potential witness. -Right there.
this lady? -Mm-hmm.
help? -Yeah.
first public killing.
he's getting bolder, huh?
he didn't let his surroundings alter his method.
he's meticulous.
I had a sickly feeling.
so you saw him? -Not his face.
he had a hood on and he kept his head down.
but something about his behavior unsettled you?
I'm sorry. I should have known.
there's no way that someone could know something like this.
it almost felt like he couldn't hear me, like he was in his own world, you know?
you spoke to him?
I just asked if he was OK.
and he didn't speak?
he didn't even look up.
I couldn't stop watching his hands.
they were moving, like he was playing a piano or fingering a rosary maybe.
he could have killed me.
unless he's not killing at random.
and whatever these people have in common's what got them killed.
I'm sorry. Would it be possible to maybe...slide that thing out of his ear?
I thought maybe he was uncomfortable being in this parish.
why would it be uncomfortable?
because of all that...
business.
a year ago, the rector was indicted for pedophilia.
a lot of people stopped worshipping here.
but Father Breeman was tried in a court of law and found innocent.
it's not my place to question that.
he's not using just any knife. It's made of flint.
as in stone?
in Egyptian mythology, flint was the symbol for protection and retribution.
with hieroglyphics, they used to depict dangerous animals like scorpions and snakes being cut with flint knives in order to render them powerless.
anything strike you as strange?
the blood's all on the inside.
fount of all knowledge. Check my flow.
I need you to check all the victims and see if any were charged with a crime.
OK. You wanna time me, or should I just dazzle you off the clock?
vehicular manslaughter.
tried and found not guilty July 2002.
Rachel Holman. Convicted of cocaine possession, 2004.
Oh, baby girl. Just say no.
no acquittals?
Uh...wait. Hold on.
jury found her not guilty. Can we go 3 for 3?
Yahtzee.
our cabbie, Walter Derbin.
spousal battery. Bastard!
but he was innocent? -If you wanna call it that.
charges were dropped mid-trial 4 months ago.
you're a genius. -You're just saying that 'cause it's true.
Thanks.
if the victim was blindfolded first, the blood would have flowed over the blindfold.
he puts it on after he kills them.
all 3 charged with a felony. All 3 found innocent.
and that didn't show up on your men's radar?
acquittals? No.
why is it important?
because we have a new profile.
we know believe these killings aren't random.
we might be dealing with a vigilante.
the unsub first shoots his victims in order to subdue them.
flint knife then provides both an efficient kill and symbolic retribution.
finally, the victim is blindfolded, like the statute of Lady Justice.
this particular unsub, he displays both a heightened it's actually almost a poetic sense of right and wrong.
serial vigilantes are extremely rare.
the exaggerated drama of these killings suggest that they're somehow personal.
he, or someone close to him, is likely the victim of a violent crime.
his first killing was possibly against his original attacker.
and since then he's developed an overblown sense of justice in order to justify that killing to himself.
because he chooses the imagery of Lady Justice, it's possible we're dealing with someone who works in or around the criminal justice system.
lawyer, paralegal, bailiff, even a judge.
we'll cross-check unsolved murders against suspects in assault cases and victims who work in the system.
whatever the unsub's job, he's someone who's a cog in the machine.
he's overworked, undervalued.
he's used to not being noticed.
his sense of theatrics is a way to enhance his own self-esteem, convince himself he has a higher purpose.
and he also knows that people look right through him.
being faceless is his best defense against protection.
he's everyone.
one last thing. We need you to close ranks.
the more details slip out, the more he'll feed off it.
we don't want him believing he captured the public's fear or imagination.
too late.
the afternoon edition's leading with the vigilante story.
how did they get it?
I don't know.
you were worried about this guy becoming another Son of Sam.
now we might be dealing with a vigilante folk hero like Bernhard Goetz.
so you know there was a big hole in the profile you presented back there.
can you pass the moo shoo, please?
what's the hole?
I left out the possibility our unsub might be a cop.
well, they do know the system.
they're definitely overworked and underpaid.
they see so much injustice every day they can easily take matters into their own hands.
when someone like our victim is killed, police refer to the murder as a public-service murder.
you know how many rapists I saw walk during my sex-crime days?
none of the victims, they didn't want to press charges.
or the juries, they said that she was asking for it.
it was enough to make you explode.
it's a long way from feeling like that and actually committing murder, don't you think?
not really.
excuse me. Can I get a fork, perhaps?
did you know that experts credit Confucius with the advent of the chopstick?
he equated knives with acts of aggression.
you don't know how to use them, do you?
it's like trying to forage for dinner with a pair of number 2 pencils.
OK, here, let me help you.
well, New York City cops do have a lot of pressure on 'em.
every move they make is scrutinized.
you know, the first cases of criminal profiling happened when a New York City cop asked a criminal psychiatrist friend to help with the mad bomber case.
the mad bomber was a major inspiration for the unabomber.
he eluded cops in New York for 16 years, starting in 1940.
but he kept his promise and never set off a single bomb during the Second World War.
psychiatrist James Brussels, he developed a profile so accurate he predicted that when they caught the bomber, he'd be wearing a double-breasted suit and it would be buttoned.
you guys, we're here in New York and even when we're not talking about our case, we end up talking about another profiler.
you're right.
so, Elle...
are you seeing anyone?
uh, Gideon...
why didn't you tell the cops that it might be one of their own?
if we're gonna catch the guy, we need all the help the cops can give us.
the last thing i want to do is accuse one of them of murder.
it's absolutely incredible.
1. 3 billion people stay nourished using these things.
Yeah. OK. I got it.
he just took out a cop killer.
his name's Shawn Cooley.
one year ago, he killed 2 port authority cops.
and he walked because the only witness against him was shot 6 times outside his apartment.
it might be worth having your men re-canvas this morning.
people are more likely to talk in the day.
they feel safer. -I'm already on it.
more bad news.
it's the same reporter every time. Ncwagner.
he's practically deifying him.
I'm not even happy with the results when god plays god.
you know, a few of the men were talking about making him wish list of other dirtbags.
some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets.
taxi driver.
this town loves a psychopath.
why hasn't he contacted the press yet?
Reid's right.
he's got the symbolism, the inflated sense of duty.
he should be seeking out acclaim.
maybe it's not about acclaim with him.
he's on a mission. Maybe it's about the work.
Yeah, but the last 2 cases were a cop killer and a pedophile priest. Those are higher profile cases.
I'll check the press archives for controversial acquittals.
maybe we can target the victim before the unsub, have the police waiting on him.
Hey, guys. Listen to what came off the tip hotline.
I got a tip. Let the guy be.
how come the NYPD wants to catch this guy?
are you jealous he's doing the job better than you?
it goes on for half an hour.
he's a hero.
the exact same thing happened with the Goetz-New York subway shooting the early eighties.
you weren't even born.
I read a lot.
Hey, talk to me, baby. -Who do you love?
that depends on what you're giving me.
Oh, don't be such a man.
I ran the names of the 5 victims like you asked.
no overlap in arresting officers, public defenders or district attorneys.
do I sense a but -small but.
you're killing me with Entendres.
but each one was processed at the Manhattan criminal courthouse at 100 centre street.
do you have any idea how many cases run through there every year?
122998.0
but at least we've eliminated 4 other boroughs, hmm?
Yeah, great. All right.
it's a start. Thanks.
ta.
do you have any idea how many cases?
122, 998 cases a year.
we'll check it out.
maybe there's someone with a history of erratic behavior who worked in the building.
crime groupies.
a security guard that fits the profile.
get with J. J. See what you can make of her case list.
OK.
I'll go with you.
ever crossed your mind?
taking the law into my own hands?
not the law, justice.
what's this about? The boys in Iowa?
it's just a question.
I guess if I think if I ever let my mind go there, then the unsubs would be getting into my head instead of me getting into theirs.
that wouldn't be a good idea, now, would it?
the cops have already been down here asking their questions.
I just want to give you a description of someone, see if he sounds familiar.
he's quiet. He...
body language gives the impression he's seen too much.
work in this building long enough, we all get that way.
he's small, meticulous. You might not notice him at first, but when you do, you realize he's heard everything around him.
he might have had a personal brush with crime.
when it happened, he talked bout it all the time.
but now you realize he hasn't mentioned it in quite a while.
and when the subject of the vigilante comes up, he expresses his support, but it's not something he would bring up in conversation himself.
well, if people are being honest with you, that's most of the people in this building.
how old are you?
I'll give you 6 years.
that point, a tiny part of your brain will be asking if what this guy's doing isn't the right way to go.
anything? -Uh-uh. You?
no.
what happened in Iowa?
so it was one of the first cases Hotch and I worked together.
small town, 2 boys had been murdered, same signature.
the profile led us to the local leader.
at some point, he turns the shotgun on Hotch.
sounds like pretty good work.
at trial, the guy's wife gave him an alibi for both murders.
small town. They all knew each other. The jurors believed her.
eventually they got him when he killed another boy.
any luck?
this guy's not doing us any favors.
his access is unbelievable.
he's practically scooping us.
the FBI needs help and they get you to do their bidding?
I am an FBI special agent.
the rest of the team is too busy. They're out in the field.
Yeah, and they're doing a bang-up job, too.
look, the fact is you've scooped every other reporter in New York.
you've even managed to be ahead of the cops a few times.
a good crime reporter needs to be better than the police. You got less to go on.
well, that's why agent Gideon was hoping you'd accept this invitation to help.
he used to be one of the best.
he still is. -Yeah. He had kind of a famous meltdown.
and a whole string of success since he's returned.
Yeah, yeah. Meltdown's make better copy.
maybe you can take that up with him yourself...
you know, if you decide to come in.
so how did you put together the vigilante angle so quickly?
I covered the original trials of all the victims.
you must have a good memory.
a lot of killers can't remember details from their own crimes.
some cases just stick right in your brain.
tell us about the victims.
all right. Well, this girl, she was just a waste case.
the jury bought into the whole "addiction as disease" bs.
and this old guy, he was a thug. He beat his wife, but the case fell apart because she wouldn't testify.
he drank and drove.
it was a tragedy, but...
it was the kind of thing that could happen to anybody.
so who do you think we're looking for? What's his background?
my guess is he's a crime victim.
probably something violent.
but you do think he's a hero.
well...
you know,this city make you swallow a lot of crap.
it's hard not to feel for someone who won't take it anymore.
these haven't been released to the press. They're pretty grim.
I've seen plenty of crime scenes.
right.
we're stuck on the ear.
is it for killing efficiency or symbolism?
why would you stab someone through the ear into their brain?
what's going on here?
the profile leads us to think that he works close to the criminal justice system. What do you think?
no, no.
you didn't bring me in here because you wanted my help.
the profile suggests this guy'd contact the media. He hasn't.
and we thought the killer wouldn't need to contact the press if he were the press.
you're single-handedly turning this psychopath into a folk hero.
so what happened? You get your men killed on the job and you think everybody else must be a killer, too?
watch your mouth. -It's ok, Hotch.
not our guy. -You're damn right.
I didn't kill anybody. What about you?
you're right.
you're not the killer.
Mm-hmm.
everything you feel is vicarious. You don't have it in you to act.
this psycho's the last chance for you.
you've screwed up other jobs. You drink too much.
probably have a broken marriage or two.
you're actually hoping he doesn't get caught for a while.
part of you knows that's twisted and pathetic,but hey...
you're just reporting the news,right?
Hey! Hey!
the reporter is not a vigilante.
Yeah, we know. How do you know?
there was just another shooting in central park.
you say shooting. What about the rest of the signature?
officers heard the shot, but he ran off before they got there.
the victim was an undercover cop.
I think you're looking for me.
put the gun on the ground!
on your knees! -Drop the gun!
get down.
don't move.
no, you don't understand.
I did this all for you.
we're in this together.
his name's will Sykes. He's a security guard at a boutique in Soho.
he was a mugging victim last year. Spent 2 days in intensive care.
fits the profile.
how's it going in here?
he just confessed to all the murders.
so what were you doing in the park?
it's full of animals.
muggers and scum, drug dealers.
I knew one of them would try to prey on me.
that's not your usual method.
I mean, you target them. You don't let them target you.
I made that point, now I'm making this one.
which is?
if you hunt us on the street, you will die the way you lived.
so why turn yourself in now?
I can't change the city without help.
people need to be inspired.
they need to see me.
they need to hear my voice.
can you tell me about the cab driver, Derbin?
he was a thug. A wife beater.
and the priest?
what's to know?
he preyed on young boys.
is that why you stabbed him in the groin?
it's what he deserved.
thank you.
why would he confess to murders he didn't commit?
because he has narcissistic delusions.
he wants the glory. He wants to be a star.
he went into the park hoping that somebody would mess with him.
he killed your undercover officer but not the others.
so where dos that leave us?
we know our unsub has a heightened sense of right and wrong.
if he knew that he inspired a would-be vigilante to murder an undercover cop, he might feel remorse.
you think you might be able to mend fences with the reporter, Wagner?
if it played to his ego, yeah.
we might be able to draw the unsub out. That's a good one.
Wagner said this morning that the cop's blood is all over the vigilante's hands.
how did J. J. get him to cooperate?
the unsub may feel a need to be there, to physically mourn for what he caused.
if that article lures him, Wagner gets to claim he caught a murderer.
it's the ultimate scoop.
will they know how to spot him?
I briefed your men. If the unsub's there, he'll be alone, out of place, not speaking to anyone else, probably not even making eye contact.
hopefully, he'll panic, draw attention to himself.
I can never get that sound out of my head.
wakes me in the middle of the night.
if there was any justice, cop killers would have to hear it for an eternity.
Hey, Hotch. Hotch, it's Morgan.
thank you--listen, something's funky, man.
I'm here trying to get transcripts from the victims'original trials.
I thought maybe there could have been a disturbance at the courthouse, or maybe the unsub even made himself known. You know what I mean?
Yeah.
OK. Well, here's the thing. There are no records available yet from the cabbie's trial.
the clerk told me that your average court reporter is 3 to 6 months behind in transcribing his notes.
that means that anyone who knows the details of that case had to have been in the courtroom.
court reporters take their work home with them.
they get paid overtime. They take their notes in court and finish transcribing them at night.
you know what Bennett said about not being able to get the sound of bagpipes out of her head?
maybe that's why the unsub stabs the ears.
killers often harm their victims in ways that they themselves have been harmed.
court reporters, by definition, are a faceless cog in the machine.
he sits there day in and day out transcribing testimony.
what if the voices wouldn't stop when you left the courtroom?
they witness at the church said that the unsub -was playing a piano-like motion. -Or transcribing.
killing's a good way to get the voices to stop, huh?
Holla.
I need the name of the court stenographer in each of the victims' original trials.
same one every time. Marvin Doyle.
cross-check him against crime records. See if he was ever the victim of a violent crime.
not him.
his parents killed in an attempted robber,'04.
that's his stressor. Is he still working?
100 center, courtroom 12-b we've got him.
Marvin Doyle. Is that him?
Doyle called in sick.
we were in this courtroom yesterday.
he saw us.
tell your judge I need a warrant. Take that.
Marvin Doyle. FBI. Open up.
clear!
it's clean.
he's gonna keep the voices out.
he sound-proofed the entire place.
he ripped the speakers out of the television and the radio.
and here is life insurance check for $250, 000.
it's 2 years old. He didn't cash it.
he won't accept blood money.
here's a box full of flint knives. There's got to be a hundred of 'em.
Hey, guys. Come take a look at this.
it's a stenography machine. Look at the keys.
they're all worn out.
it's like he was trying to transcribe the voices in his head and he couldn't keep up.
looks like hieroglyphics.
it's called steno. It's basically a phonetic series of syllables.
no court reporter takes notes the same way so no one can translate them but the reporter himself.
he's getting paid overtime to study potential victims.
he knows we're onto him. He's racing us now.
someone in these boxes is targeted to die.
we need to get inside his head and figure out who so we can stop him.
let's go. Start fishin'.
this is a lot of boxes. How are we supposed to narrow it down?
check and see if it ended in acquittal. If it didn't, toss it aside.
it has to be a capital case. He's escalating. The more brutal the better.
why not go by most recent?
judging by his elaborate filing system, Doyle obviously has obsessive-compulsive disorder.
people with OCD often finish tasks then go back to the beginning and start over.
so he continually goes through the transcripts and the first one to trigger him becomes his next victim.
here's one.
this is a liquor store owner who was shot with his own gun.
flip to when they present the defense. Did the defendant testify?
no.
stick with the ones where the accused took the stand.
this is personal. He hears their voices.
Doyle's victims all claimed to be a type of victim themselves.
they first two threw themselves on the mercy of the court, pleading alcohol and drug dependency.
the priest said he was a victim, victim of recent hysteria.
look for key phrases: Victim, mercy, anything that signifies they thought their crime wasn't their fault.
I think I might have one, guys. Ted Elmore.
he shot and killed both his parents after claiming self-defense for years of physical abuse.
Doyle lost his own parents. Hearing someone get away with killing their own, that would haunt him.
Hello?
is Ted Tlmore there?
not right now. Can I take a message?
who's this?
this is his wife. Who's this?
my name is Jason Gideon. I'm with the FBI.
honey, the FBI is on the phone?
Mrs. Elmore!
Mrs. Elmore!
come on!
he's there.
I think I can talk him out.
I have snipers up high. If they get a clean shot, they have my order to take it.
we might be able to reason.
we rushed him.
he doesn't want to have an innocent hostage.
he has an exaggerated sense of right and wrong.
and so do I.
talking's worth a shot.
I'm coming with you.
shut up!
he didn't do anything to you.
tell her how you lied.
tell her how you killed your parents and pretended they'd been hurting you.
they did hurt me.
I'll kill him.
then you wouldn't get to hear the truth.
if he admits the truth, the voices will stop, right?
they always lie.
do you have the shot?
negative.
let us interrogate him?
put the gun down. We're the FBI. We'll get the truth.
Marvin, I'm gonna put my gun away.
we'll do this together, OK?
tell him the truth.
tell him how you lied on the stand.
they did hurt me.
don't listen to them.
if he dies, they'll go away!
what do you think? They won't come back?
Beverly, Iowa, 1999.
a man kills 2 boys only to walk away free and kill another one.
stop.
Haskins, Georgia, last year.
3 white guys kill a black teenager
just because 4 witnesses see it. The jury finds them not guilty
just because.
the first 2 boys were 14 years old. The third was only 12.
stop! -It doesn't stop.
you can't kill fast enough to keep up.
they killed my parents.
I know.
I'm so tired.
Marvin, listen to me.
why don't you just give me the gun?
promise you...
I will get you a place to rest.
are you clear now?
I heard there was a secret code the day that played and it pleased the Lord but you don't really care for music, do you?
well, it goes like this the fourth or fifth the minor fall and the major lift the baffled king composing, hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah.
gandhi said, "it is better to be violent, if there's violence in our hearts than to put on the cloak of non-violence to cover impotence."
gandhi also said, "I object to violence, because when it appears to do good."
man: SCOTCH. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE MISSING.
the SMOOTH, SMOKY FLAVOR
of A SINGLE BARREL SCOTCH
with A JUICY PORTERHOUSE.
I WAS REALLY HOPING YOU'D GET YOUR APPETITE BACK.
you're GONNA NEED TO EAT.
you're GONNA NEED YOUR STRENGTH.
what?
we've ONLY BEEN HERE AN HOUR. YOU'VE MADE 2 CALLS.
And?
you HATE THE PHONE, ELLE.
I DON'T HATE THE PHONE. ACTUALLY, YOU DO.
did YOU KNOW THAT ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL AND ELI GRAY
simultaneously INVENTED ELECTRONIC SOUND TRANSMISSION DEVICES?
it CAME DOWN TO A RACE BETWIXT THE TWO.
ye, AND BELL BEAT GRAY TO THE PATENT OFFICE BY A MATTER OF HOURS.
common KNOWLEDGE.
why ARE YOU ACTING SO WEIRD?
we're SITTING WITH A GUY WHO KNOWS THAT THERE ARE 800 KERNELS OF CORN ON THE AVERAGE COB...
ranged IN 16 SEPARATE ROWS.
and YOU'RE CALLING ME WEIRD?
I KNEW IT. YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND.
you ARE BASING THIS ON WHAT EXACTLY, THAT I DON'T LIKE THE PHONE?
you've BEEN A PROFILER FOR HOW LONG, DEREK, AND THAT'S--THAT'S WEAK.
what's WEAK?
morgan THINKS ELLE HAS A BOYFRIEND.
you JUST DENIED IT.
do YOU?
it's MORE FUN NOT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
that RIGHT THERE IS A YES, BABY.
I KNEW IT. I TOLD YOU.
she DOESN'T WANT TO ADMIT TO ANYTHING, MAN.
Reid, TRUST ME. YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN.
FBI TAMPA HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING A SERIES OF MURDERS OVER THE PAST 2 MONTHS ALONG FLORIDA'S CENTRAL GOLF COAST.
I CONSULTED WITH THE SAC DOWN THERE. THEY HAD A STRONG LEAD.
and DNA EVIDENCE.
all 4 WOMEN WERE KILLED BY THIS MAN-- MARK GREGORY.
if THEY KNOW WHO HE IS, HE'S NOT REALLY AN UNSUB.
why ARE THEY CALLING US?
they WEREN'T ABLE TO ARREST HIM BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED.
they LET A SERIAL KILLER GET AWAY? HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN MISSING?
about 36 HOURS, ALONG WITH THIS WOMAN
what DO WE KNOW OUT THE OTHER VICTIMS?
they WERE ALL ABDUCTED WITHIN A 60-MILE RADIUS,
tortured AND THEN DROWNED IN HOTEL BATHTUBS.
they WERE ALL FOUND A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER THEY WERE REPORTED MISSING.
Morgan: SAME GEOGRAPHICAL AREA,
and HE'S KILLING IN HOTELS INSTEAD OF PRIVATE, CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS.
he CAN PAY FOR PRIVACY IN A HOTEL ROOM.
let's JUST HOPE HE'S NOT HEADING FOR ORLANDO.
it's SECOND ONLY TO LAS VEGAS IN THE NUMBER OF HOTEL ROOMS.
well, KNOWING WHO HE IS IS CERTAINLY PART OF THE EQUATION,
but IT'S A LONG WAY FROM KWING WHERE HE IS.
a SERIAL KILLER WHO'S BEEN SUSSED OUT AND IS ON THE LOOSE,
he's GOT 2 CHOICES.
he's EITHER HIDING OR, WORSE, HE'S ON THE RUN.
and IF GREGORY FEELS LIKE HE'S GOT NOTHING TLOSE...
he's GOT THE WHOLE COUNTRY AHEAD OF HIM.
Gideon: THE FRENCH PHILOSOPHER VOLTAIRE WROTE, "THERE ARE SOME THAT ONLY EMPLOY WORDS"
for THE PURPOSE OF DISGUISING THEIR THOUGHTS.
this IS EVERYTHING THE TAMPA OFFICE HAS ON MARK GREGORY.
he's A SINGLE WHITE MAN, 38 YEARS OLD.
graduated FROM FSU.
started HIS OWN REAL ESTATE COMPANY WITH A BUSINESS PARTNER 5 YEARS AGO.
he FREQUENTLY TRAVELS FOR WORK AROUND THE COUNTRY,
sometimes OVERSEAS.
just LAST YEAR HE PURCHASED A VERY LAVISH HOME IN SARASOTA.
what WAS HE DOING BEFORE HE GOT INTO REAL ESTATE?
it SAYS HE RACED CARS AFTER COLLEGE,
even WORKED AS A CHEF AT A FRENCH RESTAURANT.
Jack OF ALL TRADES.
Yeah, HE'S PLENTY MASTERED.
he WORKED AS A STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER FOR A COUPLE OF MAGAZINES ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST
before TRANSITIONING TO WORK WITH MODELS IN MIAMI.
it's STRANGE SO MANY SERIAL KILLERS MAKE A HOBBY OF PHOTOGRAPHY.
it MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE ACT OF VOYEURISM.
what ABOUT HIS BANK ACCOUNTS AND CREDIT CARDS?
they SEIZED EVERYTHING TER HE DISAPPEARED 36 HOURS AGO.
so WHEN HE USES HIS CREDIT CARDS OR GOES TO HIS HOUSE OR WORK, THEN THEY'VE GOT HIM.
I HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT MARK GREGORY. I WANNA HEAR ABOUT HIS VICTIMS.
Hotch: GREGORY USED DIFFERENT FORMS OF TORTURE WITH EACH ONE.
choking, BURNING, SUSPENSION, AND BEATING.
drowning WAS THE ONLY CONSTANT. THEY WERE ALL CLASSIFIED AS "WET DROWNINGS,"
which MEANS THE VICTIM WAS ALIVE WHEN THEY WERE SUBMERGED.
they COULD FEEL THEIR LUNGS FILLING UP WITH WATER.
it's AN EXTREMELY PAINFUL WAY TO DIE.
why WOULD HE TAKE THE TIME?
they WERE BARELY ALIVE AFTER ALL THE TORTURE.
drowning's A FORM OF TORTURE, TOO, AND IT'S ALL PART OF THE SIGNATURE.
SSA SON GIDEON. WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE.
sorry FOR THE TEMPORARY SETUP.
we WANTED YOU CLOSER TO WHERE MARK GREGORY LIVES.
please CONTINUE.
we WERE JUST DISCUSSING DROWNING AS A CLEANSING RITUAL.
if WE LOOK BACK INTO GREGORY'S CHILDHOOD,
we MAY FIND WHAT HE NEEDS TO PURGE.
you THINK THAT'S THE BEST USE OF OUR TIME?
we're ITCHING TO FIND THIS GUY. HE GOT AWAY ON OUR WATCH.
by STUDYING HIS BEHAVIOR AS A CHILD,
it HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHY HE DOES WHAT HE DOES.
you KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS KILLER EXCEPT WHY HE DOES IT.
so THE FURTHER WE GO BACK, THE FURTHER AHEAD OF HIM WE MIGHT GET.
were YOU ABLE TO CONNECT GREGORY TO ALL 4 VICTIMS?
he HAD A PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FIRST WOMAN HE KILLED.
we CAN LOOK INTO THAT AS THE POSSIBLE STRESSOR.
the SECOND AND THIRD WERE ACQUAINTANCES FROM BUSINESS DEALS.
the FOURTH WORKED AT A RESTAURANT THE SAME TIME HE DID.
what's HIS CONNECTION TO THE MISSING GIRL?
we CAN'T FIND ANYTHING.
GREGORY'S BIG NEWS IN FLORIDA.
when DO WE HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE TO ALERT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY?
hopefully WE'LL FIND GREGORY BEFORE WE HAVE TO.
so IF WE SPLIT UP, WE'LL COVER MORE GROUND.
does HE STILL HAVE FAMILY IN THE AREA?
his DAD'S CLOSE BY.
why DON'T WE START FROM THE PRESENT AND WORK OUR WAY BACKWARDS.
Reid AND I WILL GO TO GREGORY'S HOUSE.
elle AND I WILL TALK WITH BUSINESS PARTNER, HANK BLOOMBERG.
I'll COMB THROUGH SOME OF THE EVIDENCE HERE.
Garcia's GONNA WANT AN UPDATE. I'LL CATCH UP WITH HER.
good. LET'S MEET BACK HERE IN 2 HOURS.
if HE'S FOLLOWING HIS PREVIOUS PATTERN,
we HAVE LESS THAN 12 HOURS TO FIND NICOLE WEGENER ALIVE.
Hotch: MR. BLOOMBERG.
Yes.
agents HOTCHNER AND GREENAWAY, FBI.
I've ALREADY TALKED TO THE POLICE.
we're FROM THE BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS UNIT,
and I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE SOME DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.
we're LOOKING FOR SOME INSIGHT INTO MARK GREGORY'S BEHAVIOR
right BEFORE THE KILLING STARTED.
things YOU MIGHT NOT THINK ARE IMPORTANT COULD ACTUALLY BE HELPFUL.
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE DISAPPEARED. YOU SURE YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT GUY?
usually WHEN SOMEONE TAKES OFF,
it GIVES US REASON TO BE SUSPICIOUS.
well, I'VE NEVER NOTICED ANY ODD BEHAVIOR.
we've WORKED TOGETHER FOR 5 YEARS. I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR 10.
he HELPED COACH MY SON'S SOCCER LEAGUE THIS PAST FALL.
he's MY BEST FRIEND.
what ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH WOMEN?
mark's THE CONSUMMATE LADIES MAN.
he ALWAYS HAD A DIFFERENT WOMAN ON HIS ARM.
never HAD A PROBLEM GETTING A DATE.
dating DOESN'T DO IT FOR HIM.
he LIKES TO TORTURE AND DROWN THEM.
what DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS HISTORY WITH WOMEN?
he WAS MARRIED ONCE IN HIS EARLY 20s.
swore HE'D NEVER DO IT AGAIN.
did YOU KNOW HER?
no. IT WAS BEFORE I MET HIM.
do YOU KNOW IF SHE'S STILL IN THE AREA?
wait MINUTE.
you THINK HE DID SOMETHING TO HIS EX-WIFE?
we're LOOKING FOR AT WE CALL A "STRESSOR,"
what COULD HAVE MADE HIM LOSE IT.
we HAVE TO LOOK INTO ALL THE POSSIBILITIES.
if WE NEED TO ASK YOU ANY MORE QUESTIONS, WE'LL FIND YOU.
thank YOU.
I BET GREGORY'S BEEN KILLING A LOT LONGER THAN WE THINK, LONG BEFORE HE DISAPPEARED.
this IS A REALLY LARGE HOUSE WITH HARDLY ANY FURNITURE.
typical BACHELOR PAD.
large SOFA, BIG-SCREEN TV,
white WALLS.
I NOTICED A LUXURY CAR IN THE GARAGE,
but IT'S AT LEAST 10 YEARS OLD.
where ARE THE DOGS?
Gideon, CHECK THIS OUT.
this GUY'S GOT, LIKE, 20 DIFFERENT SUITS.
some ITALIAN. SOME TAYLOR.
some LEISURE SUITS.
he's GOT A MECHANIC'S UNIFORM.
wide ASSORTMENT OF WATCHES AND WALLETS.
approximately 20 DIFFERENT PAIRS OF SHOES.
take A LOOK AT ALL THESE DRIVER LICENSES.
he CAN START HIS OWN DMV.
feed THOSE TO GARCIA.
travels AROUND THE COUNTRY
to BUY AND SELL DIFFERENT PROPERTIES.
probably REINVENTS HIMSELF WITH EACH DEAL HE MAKES.
plays A DIFFERENT ROLE.
dresses UP TO IMPRESS A RICH INVESTOR
and DRESSES DOWN FOR A POOR FARMER.
this GUY'S A CHAMELEON. HE CAN ADAPT TO ANY SITUATION.
from THE OUTSIDE, THIS HOUSE SEEMS CLEAN AND SHINY.
but IT'S LIKE ALL FOR SHOW,
like IT'S A FACADE TO HIDE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON.
drawerful OF CATALOGS.
uniforms FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT,
construction, JANITORIAL, MILITARY.
what DO YOU THINK HE NEEDS THESE FOR?
probably HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS.
someone's TRYING TO DISGUISE HIMSELF.
room SERVICE.
room SERVICE.
we RECEIVED YOUR CALL TO PICK UP LAST NIGHT'S DINNER, MR. GREGORY.
Yes. COME IN.
was EVERYTHING OK?
my PORTERHOUSE WAS JUICY AND RARE,
just THE WAY I LIKE IT.
but MY WIFE WASN'T FEELING VERY WELL.
hoping A HOT BATH WILL DO THE TRICK.
honey, HOW IS EVERYTHING IN THERE?
I GUESS PRETTY GOOD.
thank YOU VERY MUCH, OSCAR.
Garcia: ANGEL MARK GREGORY WAS SUCH A BAD BOY.
how BAD?
well, WHEN HE WAS A KID, HE WAS CAUGHT PEEKING IN A NEIGHBOR'S WINDOW.
I'm SURE IT GETS WORSE, RIGHT?
at THE RIPE AGE OF 18, HE--HOW DO I PUT THIS DELICATELY?
had AN INTENSE AFFECTION FOR LADIES WITH LEARNER'S PERMITS.
that SOUNDS LIKE STATUTORY RAPE. I'M NOT SURPRISED. YOU TALK TO HOTCH?
Yeah. IT TURNS OUT HIS MARRIAGE LASTED ONLY 23 DAYS.
our BOY'S GOT SERIOUS COMMITMENT ISSUES.
and FRET NOT, MY SWEET. THAT POOR GIRL WHO MARRIED HIM IS STILL OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.
if SHE WERE DEAD, IT WOULD BE EASIER TO FIND HER.
well, IT'S A GOOD THING 'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA WANT TO TALK TO HER.
some OF HIS DEVIANT BEHAVIOR MUST'VE LEAKED INTO OTHER PARTS OF HIS LIFE.
at LEAST SHE GOT OUT ALIVE.
we FOUND EVIDENCE AT HIS HOUSE
that HE ACCLIMATES WELL TO DIFFERENT SURROUNDINGS.
possible DISGUISES.
he's EMPTIED HIS BANK ACCOUNTS AND HE'S PUT HIS DOGS IN A KENNEL.
we're CERTAIN HE'S LEFT THE AREA AND HE'S NOT COMING BACK.
and SINCE HE'S ON THE RUN, THIS CLASSIFIES HIM AS A "SPREE KILLER.
usually THIS TYPE OF KILLER GOES THROUGH 2 PHASES: GUIDED AND RANDOM.
guided" MEANS THAT THIS KILLER STAYS
in HIS PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR COMFORT ZONE
until HE BREAKS DOWN.
that's WHY HE KILLED THE FIRST 4 WOMEN IN A 60-MILE RADIUS.
that's RIGHT. AND WE'RE HOPING HE'S STILL THERE.
in THE GUIDED PHASE, THEY USUALLY HAVE A FINAL DESTINATION IN MIND.
like EDMUND KEMPER AND ANDREW CUNANAN,
they SAVED THEIR MOST MEANINGFUL KILLS TILL LAST.
we SHOULD FIND OUT WHO THAT WOULD BE FOR GREGORY.
when THE RANDOM PHASE BEGINS, THE KILLS SEEM TO BE WITHOUT DESIGN.
there's LESS TIME IN BETWEEN THEM.
at THAT POINT, HE'S LOST TOTAL CONTROL.
and AS HE DEVOLVES,
he's GONNA TAKE MORE VICTIMS AND BECOME LESS NOTICEABLE.
what DOES THAT MEAN?
in GREGORY'S CASE, HIS M. O. IS THE TORTURE.
that WOULD MEAN HE WILL TORTURE LESS
and SPEND MORE TIME ON THE THING THAT GIVES HIM SEXUAL RELEASE--DROWNING.
Hotch: SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND HIM WHILE HE'S STILL IN THE COMFORT ZONE.
after THAT, THERE'S NO TELLING WHERE HE'LL BE.
we'll GET A RELEASE OUT TO ALL THE MAJOR NETWORKS.
his FACE AND POSSIBLE DISGUISES WILL BE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BY DINNERTIME.
they JUST FOUND THE MISSING GIRL'S BODY.
close BY?
no Georgia
come on now looks like we're going to Georgia
elle AND MORGAN JUST LANDED IN GEORGIA.
they'll BE AT THE HOTEL IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES.
so FLORIDA'S NOT HIS ONLY COMFORT ZONE.
no. APPARENTLY, HE'S SET UP BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN U. S.
well, WE HAVE WARNINGS ALONG I-95 AND I-10
in CASE HE DECIDES TO TRAVEL ALONG THE GULF COAST.
well, NOW THAT HE'S CROSSED STATE LINES, IT'S A NATIONWIDE SEARCH.
he DOESN'T WANNA GET CAUGHT, SO HE'LL PROBABLY ALTER HIS ROUTE AND DRIVE QUIETER ROADS.
we'll PREPARE FOR THAT, TOO.
these RECORDS INDICATE THAT HE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL IN 4 DIFFERENT STATES.
so THEY MOVED AROUND A LOT.
let's TALK TO HIS FATHER, FIND OUT WHY.
maybe HE'S REVISITING PLACES WHERE HE FEELS COMFORTABLE.
the LATEST HOTEL RECORDS INDICATE THAT HE CHECKED IN USING HIS OWN NAME.
if HE DOESN'T WANT US TO CATCH HIM, WHAT'S HE DOING, TAUNTING US?
no. TAUNTING WOULD IMPLY THAT THIS IS SOME SORT OF GAME. IT ISN'T.
he's MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT HE HAS NO INTENTION
of GOING BACK TO HIS LIFE AS IT WAS.
this IS A ONE-WAY TRIP.
there's DNA PROVING HE'S THE OFFENDER.
no POINT IN COVERING HIS TRACKS NOW. THAT'LL ONLY SLOW HIM DOWN.
and IF HE WANTED US TO CATCH HIM, HE'D SIMPLY STOP RUNNING.
it's NOT LIKELY. HE'S GOT 400 GRAND IN CASH.
that TYPE OF MONEY HE CAN CHARTER A PLANE OR BUY A TICKET TO VIRTUALLY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
well, HE'S NOT HIDING. HE'S HUNTING.
besides, DRIVING WORKS FOR HIM.
it's ANONYMOUS, AND HE CAN COVER A LOT OF TERRITORY.
we SHOULD NOTIFY THE MEXICAN AND CANADIAN BORDER PATROLS.
he MIGHT TRY LEAVE THE U. S.
let THEM KNOW MOST SPREE KILLS END WITH SUICIDE BY COP.
it COULD BE HOW HE PLANS ON GETTING OUT OF HIS MESS.
Wow. MARK GREGORY SPLURGES ON HOTEL ROOMS, DOESN'T HE?
Yeah. GREAT GUY.
he OFFERS THEM A NICE, WARM ROBE RIGHT BEFORE HE DROWNS THEM.
he SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH NICOLE WEGENER.
picked HER UP IN TAMPA
and DROVE HER ALL THE WAY TO GEORGIA.
but UNLIKE HIS OTHER VICTIMS,
there's NO TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP TO LINK THE TWO OF THEM.
a RANDOM VICTIM WITH A WHE LIFE AHEAD OF HER.
she WAS BEAUTIFUL.
she WAS ALSO A STRANGER.
so IT MEANS HE HAD TO LURE HER SOMEHOW.
mark GREGORY, PHOTOGRAPHER.
so WHAT IF HE PREYED ON THIS WOMAN'S VANITY?
he's A PHOTOGRAPHER.
he OFFERS HER A PROFESSIONAL MODELING CAREER.
well, IF HE HAS A LEGITIMATE WEB SITE
and PORTFOLIO, THE RIGHT CREDENTIALS,
why WOULDN'T SHE TRUST HIM?
and A PERFECTED RUSE WOULD EXPLAIN HOW HE WAS ABLE TO GET HER THROUGH THE LOBBY OF A 5-STAR HOTEL WITH NO ONE LOOKING.
it's JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE FINDS HIMSELF ANOTHER VICTIM.
who IS YOUR DADDY?
I'm SORRY?
this HAS NOT BEEN EASY. THIS WOMAN SERIOUSLY COVERED HER TRACKS.
do YOU HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBER?
are YOU LOOKING FOR GREGORY'S EX-WIFE?
you FOUND HER. YEAH.
still IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. SETTLED DOWN IN BRADENTON.
we'll HAVE HER PICKED UP.
I'm STILL IN SHOCK.
well, IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
I'm MORE SURPRISED THAT YOU FOUND ME.
I PAID A LOT TO HAVE MY PAST ERASED.
are YOU SAYING YOU'RE NOT SURPRISED THAT MARK IS A SERIAL KILLER?
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
that's WHY WE WERE ONLY MARRIED FOR 3 WEEKS.
have YOU BEEN IN HIDING BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID HE WOULD COME AFTER YOU?
he STALKED ME FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE ANNULMENT.
I HAD TO DISAPPEAR IF I WANTED TO SURVIVE.
I KNOW IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,
but WHAT WAS LIFE WITH HIM LIKE?
terrible.
he WAS CONTROLLING, DIDN'T TRUST ME,
insisted I WAS CHEATING ON HIM WITH ANYONE,
with EVERYONE.
I COULDN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE.
I'm SORRY TO DREDGE ALL THIS UP,
but YOU'VE DEFINITELY HELPED US UNDERSTAND HIM.
he DATED HIS FIRST VICTIM. AND IF SHE CHEATED ON HIM, IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE THING THAT STARTED HIM KILLING.
man: I STILL CAN'T UNDERSTAND
how MY SON COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
your SON'S A NARCISSIST WITH A SPLIT PERSONALITY.
he's ABLE TO GAIN HIS VICTIM'S TRUST BEFORE INFLICTING PAIN UPON THEM.
this IS MOST LIKELY DERIVED FROM AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF SELF-AWARENESS.
mark HAS MASTERED THE ART OF MANIPULATION.
it ONLY ALLOWS YOU TO SEE HIS GOOD SIDE.
this IS A NIGHTMARE.
why WON'T YOU SIT DOWN, MR. GREGORY.
you MOVED AROUND A LOT WHEN MARK WAS GROWING UP?
mark NEVER COMPLAINED.
I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS GOOD AT MAKING FRIENDS.
he FIT IN WHEREVER WE WENT.
we KNOW HE'S BEEN TO GEORGIA. DO YOU KNOW WHERE ELSE HE NIGHT GO?
anyplace HE LOVED TO VISIT, ANYWHERE HE'D CALL HOME?
well, WE'VE LIVED HERE THE LONGEST.
he WOULD CONSIDER FLORIDA HOME.
mark's MOTHER ISN'T IN ANY PHOTOS.
Elizabeth DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT.
I'm SORRY.
how OLD WAS MARK WHEN THAT HAPPENED?
10
were THEY CLOSE?
she WAS HIS MOTHER.
typically, WHEN A CHILD LOSES A MOTHER,
he SEES HER AS A VICTIM,
which, THEORETICALLY, HE'D WANNA PROTECT WOMEN.
more LIKELY TO LASH OUT AGAINST THE FATHER,
blaming MEN FOR NEEDING PUNISHMENT, BUT MARK DIDN'T DO THAT.
cause YOU AND MARK WERE CLOSE?
Yes.
any REASON HE WOULD HAVE BLAMED HIS MOTHER FOR HER DEATH?
was SHE DRINKING AND DRIVING, FELL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL? ANYTHING?
no. NO, NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.
maybe HE BLAMES HER BECAUSE HE THINKS SHE ABANDONED HIM.
lost OF A FEMALE FIGURE COULD EXPLAIN WHY HE WAS A PEEPING TOM IN ADOLESCENCE.
are YOU TELLING ME
that YOUNG BOYS AREN'T CURIOUS?
sure THEY'RE CURIOUS, BUT NOT ALL OF 'EM PEEK INTO WINDOWS.
what ABOUT THE STATUTORY RAPE CHARGE?
Aw, NAH.
mark HAD JUST TURNED 18,
and HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS 15.
they WERE KIDS, FOR GOD SAKE.
it WAS HER PARENTS THAT PRESSED CHARGES.
mark EVER HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING?
what ARE YOU SAYING?
that BEING A PROTECTIVE PARENT
has TURNED MY CHILD INTO A KILLER?
no. I'M SAYING YOU'RE MAKING EXCUSES.
I'm NOT SURE IT DID HIM ANY FAVORS.
you're GONNA BE OK.
it LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST VICTIM WASN'T BEING UNFAITHFUL.
she HAD A HUSBAND AND WAS TRYING TO KEEP IT A SECRET.
sounds LIKE HE FOUND OUT.
there MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING MAJOR IN HIS PAST
to TRIGGER SUCH AN EXTREME REACTION.
maybe SOMETHING WITH HIS PARENTS' RELATIONSHIP
had SCARRED HIM DURING CHILDHOOD.
Hey, GUYS, I FOUND MARK GREGORY'S CAR
at ATLANTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
pretty SMART. THERE'S A SEA OF CARS AT THE AIRPORT.
but HE PARKED IN SHORT TERM AND HE GOT A TICKET.
there MUST HAVE BEEN ANOTHER REASON FOR HIM TO DUMP IT THERE.
guys, I KNOW WE RULED OUT FLYING,
but IT'S HARD TO IGNORE THE FACT
that HIS LAST KNOWN LOCATION WAS A PLACE
that LITERALLY HAD THOUSANDS OF INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS A DAY.
thousands OF PEOPLE. ALL POSSIBLE VICTIMS.
Garcia, IS IT POSSIBLE TO RUN THE FACE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE AT THE AIRPORT?
I'm ALREADY ON IT. I WENT AHEAD AND STARTED WITH THE SECURITY FOOTAGE AT THE PARKING GARAGE SINCE WE KNOW HE WAS IN THERE.
knowing WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE'S GOT TO BE SOME ADVANTAGE TO US.
and...
it IS. I'M UPLOADING TO YOU RIGHT NOW.
Thanks.
mccarthy: SHE SEEMED LIKE HIS TYPE.
he's LOOKING FOR THE EASIEST TARGET.
he DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE.
who DOESN'T TRUST A MAN IN UNIFORM?
he HELPS HER.
she RETURNS THE FAVOR AND GIVES HIM A RIDE.
fatal MISTAKE.
as YOU CAN SEE IN THE FOOTAGE,
he's BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS UNIFORMS.
most LIKELY, HE'LL USE THOSE OF AUTHORITY
to TRY AND INVOKE A FEELING OF SAFETY.
he MAY ALSO BE USING DISGUISES.
he's SUSPECTED OF HAVING APPROACHED A WOMAN WITH A PHOTOGRAPHY RUSE.
gregory HAS CREDENTIALS.
he WAS A PHOTOGRAPHER IN MIAMI FOR YEARS.
he's WELL TRAVELED
and CONDUCTS BUSINESS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES.
there's NO CHANCE OF PREDICTING WHERE HE'LL STRIKE NEXT.
that's WHY WE ARE ASKING YOU TO BE AWARE AND ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THIS 38-YEAR-OLD WHITE MALE.
he APPEARS TO BE VERY CONFIDENT, just a word is charming
Hotch: LET'S REVIEW WHAT WE KNOW.
gregory WILL CONTINUE TO DROWN.
the QUESTION IS WHY DOES HE HAVE TO.
we KNOW SOMEONE WHO MURDERS BY DROWNING WANTS TO INVOKE FEAR.
if WATER SYMBOLIZES EMOTION THAT SAYS THEY'RE OVERWHELMED BY THEIR OWN UNRESOLVED ISSUES OR FACING SOME SORT OF MAJOR LIFE CRISIS,
it SUGGESTS A RELEASE OF THE OLD IS NECESSARY TO EMERGE AND BEGIN ANEW.
so THERE'S SOMETHING HE'S TRYING TO PURGE OR CLEANSE BY KILLING THESE WOMEN?
reid: I THINK IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
that's THE KEY TO UNLOCK WHY HE KILLS.
excuse ME, GENTLEMEN. SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
you REALLY DON'T KNOW SOMEONE UNTIL YOU TAKE A ROAD TRIP WITH THEM.
what ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?
look AT THIS CAR, MAN.
there's EMPTY SODA CANS AND FAST-FOOD WRAPPERS EVERYWHERE.
you're A SLOB.
back AT QUANTICO YOUR DESK IS ALL NEAT.
but I BET IF YOU LOOKED IN THOSE DRAWERS, YOU'LL FIND A MESS.
OK, WE HAVE BEEN ON THE ROAD WAY TOO LONG.
Aw. THAT MUST BE THE BOYFRIEND.
Yes, IT IS. HEY, GIDEON.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Yeah. GOT IT.
Yeah.
they FOUND THE WOMAN FROM THE ATLANTA AIRPORT IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
it FEELS LIKE WE'RE DRIVING FROM BODY TO BODY.
well, WE KNOW THAT SOUTH CAROLINA'S PART OF HIS BUSINESS ROUTE.
so HE'S PROBABLY GOING BACK TO WHAT HE KNOWS.
you SEE SOMETHING?
no. I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THE INFORMATION
you RELEASED ABOUT MARK GREGORY AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE.
what ABOUT IT?
well, WE DESCRIBED HIM AS SOMEONE WHO'S ENGAGING, CONFIDENT, POSES AS PEOPLE WITH AUTHORITY.
but THIS IS A GUY WHO'S FLYING UNDER THE RADAR.
so WE MADE A MISTAKE?
no, NOT AT ALL.
we're DEALING WITH A KILLER WHO'S HIGHLY INTELLIGENT
and INCREDIBLY RESOURCEFUL.
you WOULD THINK THAT WE'VE PUSHED HIM TO CHANGE WHAT HE'S DOING.
to WHAT?
maybe HE'S NOT USING A SIMPLE RUSE ANYMORE.
he COULD ALTER HIS APPEARANCE SO HE'S BARELY RECOGNIZABLE, JUST LIKE IN THE SKETCH BOOK.
if HE DOES THAT,
we'd HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.
morgan AND GREENAWAY.
this PLACE IS...
is A HOLE IN THE WALL.
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE'S CHECKING INTO A FLEABAG MOTEL.
GREGORY'S GOT CASH.
and HE'S OBVIOUSLY DEVOLVED
into THE RANDOM PHASE OF HIS KILLS.
must HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH HOW HE VIEWS HIS VICTIMS.
well, IF HE DOESN'T KNOW THESE WOMEN,
maybe HE THINKS THAT THEY'RE NOT WORTHY OR DIRTY.
are YOU THE MANAGER?
Yes. YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
do YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN?
Yeah. KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THE GUY.
he PAID HIS BILL IN CASH ABOUT 3 HOURS AGO.
you SURE ABOUT THE TIME?
Absolutely. MY STORIES WERE ON.
well, GIVEN THE LIVIDITY,
I'd SAY SHE DIED RIGHT BEFORE THAT.
did YOU HAPPEN TO SEE WHAT HE WAS DRIVING?
Yeah. ONE OF THOSE BLACK SUVs.
that's THE VICTIM'S CAR FROM THE ATLANTA AIRPORT.
did YOU NOTICE IF IT HAD GEORGIA PLATES?
no. THEY DEFINITELY HAD SOUTH CAROLINA PLATES.
when HE WAFILLING OUT THE FORMS FOR THE MOTEL, HE COULDN'T REMBER THE NUMBER.
so I WENT OUTSIDE TO WRITE IT DOWN.
that's WHY WE CAN'T TRACK HIM. HE'S SWITCHING PLATES.
can YOU GET US THOSE NUMBERS, PLEASE?
sure. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
thank YOU.
there GOES THE PILOT UNIFORM.
well, WE KNOW HIS IDENTITY. WE KNOW HE LIKES TO USE DISGUISES,
and HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT LEAVING THEM.
look AT THE LEVEL OF TORTURE HERE.
he SPENT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME WITH HER,
but HE STILL SHOCKED HER ENOUGH TO TURN HER FEET BLACK.
no NORMAL HUMAN BEING CAN SUSTAIN THIS KIND OF TORTURE.
if HE SHOCKED HER OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THEN SHE MUST'VE DIED.
but THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS A WET DROWNING.
the ONLY WAY HE COULD'VE DONE THAT
resuscitate HER EVERY TIME JUST SO HE CAN DROWN HER AGAIN.
we KNOW THAT HE WAS SPENDING 2 DAYS WITH THESE WOMEN.
but HE PICKED HER UP AT THE AIRPORT YESTERDAY.
so HE'S SPENDING HF AS MUCH TIME WITH THEM NOW.
and NOW HE'S PROBABLY GOT HIMSELF ANOTHER ONE.
who's THE ANSWER TO ALL YOUR DREAMS?
I'm GONNA PUT YOU ON SPEAKER.
Oh, YOU COMPLETELY SUCK. HOSPITAL RECORDS SHOW MARK GREGORY FRACTURED A VERTEBRAE WHEN HE WAS 10.
he SUFFERED DAMAGE TO HIS SPINE, LIGAMENTS, AND NECK.
what CAUSED THAT TYPE OF INJURY?
reid: WHIPLASH.
behold THE WONDERFUL GENIUS OF DR. SPENCER REID.
honey, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE REST OF THE HOSPITAL RECORD SAYS.
I DID SOME MORE DIGGING.
I FOUND AN ARTICLE IN THE POLK COUNTY PAPER DESCRIBING THE CRASH.
what DID IT SAY?
the HEADLINE READS THAT ELIZABETH GREGORY DIED IN A CRASH.
but HER 10-YEAR-OLD SON WAS ONLY INJURED.
mark GREGORY WAS IN THE CAR WITH HER.
apparently.
we NEED TO TALK TO GREGORY'S FATHER,
find OUT WHAT ELSE HE'S KEEPING FROM US.
do YOU NEED SOME HELP WITH YOUR BAGS, SIR?
no. I'M GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
Oh!
Oh! OH, MY.
thank YOU.
no PROBLEM.
you KNOW, ACTUALLY I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE HELP.
thank YOU.
perfect. THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.
well, I KNOW YOU GUYS DIDN'T COME HERE
to LOOK AT PICTURES OF MY SON.
did SOMETHING HAEN?
why ARE THERE NO MEMORIES OF YOUR WIFE HERE?
why WOULD I WANT TO REMIND MY SON
of THE MOST HORRIBLE THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO HIM?
normally WHEN A PARENT DIES,
the OTHER PARENT TENDS TO OVERCOMPENSATE
by BUILDING A SHRINE OF PICTURES,
leaving THEIR PERSONAL EFFECTS UNTOUCHED SOMETIMES FOR YEARS.
you DIDN'T HAPPEN TO DO THAT.
why DIDN'T YOU TELL US YOUR SON WAS IN THE CAR WHEN YOUR WIFE DIED?
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT.
you DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT.
you DIDN'T THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO TELL US YOUR SON WITNESSED HIS MOTHER DYING?
no.
the FACT THAT HE WITNESSED HIS MOTHER DIE AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE
clearly AFFECTED HOW HE REGARDS WOMEN.
do YOU KNOW WHY YOUR SONARRIED FOR SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME?
Yes. IT WAS A MISTAKE. HE WAS YOUNG.
well, WE TALKED TO HIS EX-WIFE.
mark WAS OBSESSED WITH THINKING SHE WAS UNFAITHFUL.
it COULD HAPPEN.
but SHE NEVER WAS.
but HE MADE LIFE UNBEARABLE FOR HER. SHE COULDN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE.
she COULDN'T TAKE A BREATH WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT IT.
something MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO FEED THAT DISTRUST,
to GIVE HIM SUCH A DISTORTED VIEW OF RELATIONSHIPS.
how WERE THINGS WITH YOUR WIFE, MR. GREGORY?
normal AND UNEVENTFU
was SHE BEING UNFAITHFUL?
what? DID SHE PICK MEN UP?
all RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. ENOUGH. STOP.
uh...
when SHE COULDN'T FIND A BABY-SITTER,
she WOULD TAKE HIM WITH HER TO THE MOTEL,
let HIM PLAY BY THE POOL.
this WENT ON FOR OVER A YEAR.
what KIND OF MOTHER WOULD DO THAT?
did YOU EVER TAKE HIM TO THERAPY, MR. GREGY?
no.
Why?
I DIDN'T THINK HE NEEDED IT.
didn't THINK HE NEEDED IT?
no.
boy WATCHES HIS MOTHER DIE. HE LIVES, SHE DIES.
you DON'T THINK THAT'S CONFUSING TO A 10-YEAR-OLD?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
you DID SAY THAT.
mark WAS SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.
that EXPLAINS HIS ISSUES WITH INFIDELITY,
his HATRED TOWARDS WOMEN,
and NOW WHY HE TORTURES AND DROWNS THEM.
his FIRST VICTIM WAS MARRIED.
she WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH HIM,
WHICH--IT CLEARLY REMINDED HIM OF WHAT HIS MOTHER DID TO YOU.
you THINK YOUR WIFE'S DEATH WAS AN ACCIDENT?
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.
well, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? WHAT DO YOU THINK?
do YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
I--OK. I HAD MY SUSPICIONS.
your SON DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT DOING A HUNDRED TIMES.
these ARE INNOCENT WOMEN. INNOCENT WOMEN, MR. GREGORY.
ever OCCUR TO YOU YOUR SON MIGHT BE TRYING TO STAND UP FOR YOU IN HIS OWN SICK, DEMENTED WAY BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T THERE?
you WEREN'T THERE, MR. GREGORY.
I
help US BEFORE HE KILLS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.
help US, MR. GREGORY. HELP US.
you DO KNOW THAT DOUG GREGORY ISN'T THE KILLER, RIGHT?
Yes, I KNOW THAT.
but HE PROTECTED ONE,
and NOW AT LEAST 6 WOMEN ARE DEAD BECAUSE OF IT.
move IT.
No!
can't BE IN THE POOL WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON.
are YOU OK?
help ME. IT'S MY WIFE. SHE FELL IN THE POOL.
she CAN'T SWIM.
bring HER OVER TO THE SIDE. I KNOW CPR.
please HELP ME.
all RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
well, SHE'S NOT BREATHING.
look, MAN, I'M DOING THE BEST THAT I CAN.
why DON'T YOU GO CALL 911.
go CALL 911, MAN.
Oh, THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. GET IT OUT.
get IT OUT. ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO, HONEY.
No! NO!
it's OK. IT'S OK. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
you're BREATHING. THERE YOU GO, HONEY.
you're ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
your HUSBAND'S GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.
have YOU FOUND ANY OTHER SUSPICIOUS DROWNINGS THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS?
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY PEOPLE DROWN EVERY DAY?
Yes, BUT THEY'RE MORE IN THE SUMMER FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.
but I THINK IT AVERAGES AROUND 6, 500 A YEAR, WHICH IS 17 A DAY.
is THIS REID? WHY, YOU'RE IMPRESSED?
I AM, SLICK. I AM.
you've BEEN DOING YOUR RESEARCH, HAVEN'T YOU?
Hey, THIS ONE SOUNDS PARTICULARLY CREEPY.
Garcia FOUND A LEAD IN TENNESSEE.
Allyson GLENNON WAS SNATCHED FROM A GROCERY STORE A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO
and SURVIVED AN ATTEMPTED DROWNING IN A MOTEL POOL.
motel POOL? DOESN'T SOUND LIKE OUR GUY.
Yeah, I KNOW, EXCEPT THAT SHE'S IDENTIFIED GREGORY AS HER ATTACKER
and THE PLACE IS LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM THE LAST KILLING.
Garcia's GIVING ELLE AND MORGAN DETAILS RIGHT NOW.
Reid AND I HAD ANOTHER TALK WITH MARK'S FATHER.
we NEED TO GET EVERYBODY ON THE PHONE.
Hey, GIDEON.
we THINK MARK'S FIRST VICTIM WAS HIS MOTHER.
what?
I'm SORRY. YOU'RE SAYING A 10-YEAR-OLD KILLED HIS OWN MOM?
well, IT'S A COMMON THEORY
that SONS CAN FIXATE ON THEIR MOTHERS
since THEIR MOTHERS ARE THEIR INTRODUCTION TO LOVE.
and IF THAT MOTHER HAD A NEGATIVE INFLUENCE
in THIS CASE SHE WAS AN ADULTERESS
it INVALIDATED NOT ONLY THE FATHER BUT REFLECTED POORLY ONTO THE SON.
mark GREGORY WAS A CHILD, BUT HE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS MOTHER WAS DOING.
he WAS PROTECTING A WEAK, IMPOTENT, PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE FATHER
who WANTED HIS WIFE DEAD.
he READ THE OLD MAN LIKE A BOOK AND LIVED THE LIFE HE COULDN'T.
because SHE WAS HIS MOTHER, HE SAW HER AS A SAINT.
but BECAUSE SHE WAS A CHEATER, HE ALSO SAW HER AS A SINNER.
there's A GOOD CHANCE HE CAUSED THE CAR TO CRASH.
do YOU THINK THE FATHER KNEW HIS SON WAS A MURDERER?
Yes.
reid: THAT'S WHY HE'S SO OVERPROTECTIVE OF HIM.
we NEED TO GO THROUGH ALL THE EVIDENCE FROM THE CAR ACCIDENT.
absolutely EVERYTHING.
news ARTICLES, MEDICAL RECORDS, POLICE REPORTS. I'M ON IT.
we NEED TO DO IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
there's A KILLER ON THE RUN AND HE'S GRABBING WOMEN AS HE SEES THEM.
I GOT DONE SOONER THAN I THOUGHT,
so I'LL BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE KIDS AFTER THE BELL.
OK. SEE YOU THEN.
do EXACTLY AS I SAY OR YOU'LL DIE.
when I GOT TO THE POOL, HE SAID HE WAS GONNA CALL FOR HELP,
but HE JUST DISAPPEARED.
so YOU'RE THINKING, "WHY WOULDN'T I TRUST THIS GUY?"
what KIND OF PSYCHO WOULD KILL SOMEBODY IN FRONT OF WITNESSES?
Yeah. YEAH. I'D SEEN THE NEWS.
but THIS MAN DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE ONE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
he LEFT HIS GLASSES IN THE POOL.
and WHEN HE LEFT, HE WALKED WITH A LIMP.
and NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT GLASSES OR A LIMP,
so...
he MIGHT BE IN A HURRY, BUT HE'S NOT LOOKING TO GET CAUGHT.
cause HE'S NOT DONE KILLING YET.
Hotch: HERE'S A POLICE PHOTO OF THE CAR GREGORY'S MOTHER WAS KILLED IN.
right THERE. SEE THE WATER DRIPPING FROM UNDER THE CAR?
it DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A FATAL CAR CRASH.
all THE DAMAGE WAS DONE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.
what WAS HER OFFICIAL CAUSE OF DEATH?
I'll ASK GARCIA.
mccarthy: WE'VE GOT A POSSIBLE ABDUCTION.
Kelly DALTON, 28.
eyewitness SAW HER LEAVING A PARKING LOT WITH A MAN RESEMBLING GREGORY.
she WAS SUPPOSED TO PICK UP HER SON. NEVER MADE IT.
Elle: THANKS, HOTCH.
he's PICKED UP A NEW VICTIM.
Hey, WE GOT TO GET TO THE MALL.
jump ON 113. IT'LL TAKE YOU 10 MINUTES.
it WAS BETTER WHEN HE HAD A RUSE.
at LEAST THAT REQUIRED A LITTLE PLANNING.
...BELIEVED TO HAVE LEFT THE PARKING LOT AND HEADED SOUTH
.HEY WERE DRIVING A GREEN JEEP WITH TENNESSEE PLATES
...if YOU SEE THIS VEHICLE OR THE PASSENGERS MEETING THE DESCRIPTIONS...
do YOU WANT MONEY OR SOMETHING?
I've GOT A RICH HUSBAND, AND I KNOW HE'LL PAY A LOT TO GET ME BACK.
so HE'S GOT A VICTIM AND A CAR.
now ALL HE NEEDS IS THE LOCATION.
there ARE 5 SOURCES OF WATER NEARBY.
closest TO THE ACCIDENT IS ROCK CREEK IN...
COPPERHILL, TENNESSEE.
there's WHERE KELLY DALTON WAS ABDUCTED.
morgan AND ELLE ARE THERE RIGHT NOW.
Reid, ONE MORE THING.
Elizabeth GREGORY'OFFICIAL CAUSE OF DEATH WAS ASPHYXIA
caused BY IMMERSION IN FLUID.
she DROWNED?
with NO DISCERNIBLE DAMAGE DONE
by KEEPING HER TRAPPED IN THE CAR,
what WOULD CAUSE A TALLER MOTHER TO DROWN
and A SMALLER CHILD TO SURVIVE?
Gideon: THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY.
mark GREGORY HELD HIS MOTHER'S HEAD UNDER WHATEVER WATER WAS IN THE CAR.
his FIRST KILL WAS HIS MOST POWERFUL.
well, AT LEAST WE KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING.
back TO WHERE IT ALL STARTED.
please, I HAVE 2 BOYS. they need me
shut UP.
Gideon: THE ARTICLE SAID THE ACCIDENT WAS ON ROUTE 60
near EAST WEST HIGHWAY.
we're ON ROUTE 60 ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM ROCK CREEK.
we're PULLING OVER TO CHECK IT OUT.
this IS ALL YOUR FAULT.
what IS?
I SAW YOU EVERY WEEK WITH THAT MAN.
you THINK I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON?
I've NEVER MET YOU BEFORE.
shut UP! YOU'RE A LIAR!
turn HERE.
Gideon, HE'S NOT HERE.
slow DOWN!
stop!
stop! STOP!
you HEAR THAT? DID YOU GUYS HEAR THAT?
Yeah, I HEARD IT.
it's OVER THERE. LET'S GO.
you THOUGHT YOU COULD GET AWAY.
No! [SCREAMS]
please!
somebody HELP ME!
it's JUST THE TWO OF US OUT HERE.
it's CLEAR. NOBODY IN THE CAR.
Elle: WE FOUND THE CAR OFF THE ROAD, BUT IT'S EMPTY.
we're SEARCHING THE WOODS NOW, AND WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.
which WAY IS THE WATER?
help ME!
somebody HELP!
that's COMING FROM OVER THERE.
No!
how DOES THAT FEEL?
mark GREGORY, FBI! PUT IT DOWN!
put IT DOWN!
come HERE. I GOT YOU.
OK.
you're OK.
he CAN'T HURT YOU ANYMORE.
Hey. IT'S MORGAN.
Kelly DALTON'S GONNA BE OK.
GREGORY'S DEAD.
we're COMING HOME.
Gideon: THE AUTHOR FRANCOIS DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD WROTE, "WE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO DISGUISE OURSELVES TO OTHERS"
that IN THE END WE BECOME DISGUISED TO OURSELVES.
St. LOUIS, MISSOURI.
OK.
Oh!
it is not just me, right?
our girl's got an arm. - Yeah.
Oh. Just like her dad.
look at her. We blinked and 4 years went by.
so, what do you think? Should we do this again?
sounds like a plan.
Uh-oh. Who's coming? Aah!
Ah. So, what do you think, katie?
you want a little brother or sister? Yeah? Well...
the boss has spoken.
OK. Well, you go get her, and I'll go get lunch.
OK.
my daughter Molly. She's 6.
she's got braids, yellow sweatshirt.
what am I gonna do? - Ok, ok. Calm down.
braids, yellow sweatshirt.
we were playing hideand seek up here. She must have gotten lost in the trees.
Oh, god. I'm so stupid.
shh, shh, shh! Wait.
did you hear that? It came from over here.
Molly? Honey?!
daddy's here.
no.
did you find Molly? Is she ok?
mommy, wake up. It's past 10: 00.
Ah! Damn it. Why did you let me sleep?
why don't you get an alarm clock?
did you eat? - Pizza.
and the baby? - Pizza. And milk.
get some sleep, Jay.
Hey, I'll bring yousome pancakes.
Yeah. When?
Hi. Want company?
Hi.
F.B.I. Headquarters QUANTICO, VIRGINIA
come in.
Hi. - Hi.
agent Hotchner? - Yes.
I'm agent Emily Prentiss.
how do you do? Oh, you're ambassador Prentiss' daughter.
I did security clearances for your mother's staff.
it was one of my first commands.
I believe you were off to Brown at the time.
actually, it was Yale. - Ah.
I've been in the bureau almost 10 years now.
don't tell me that. Has it been that long?
apparently, sir. But I work mostly in the midwest. St. Louis, chicago.
good.
your parents well? - Yeah, yeah, they're great.
excellent.
what can I do for you?
uh, well, I guess I was hoping you could tell me where to put my stuff.
I'm sorry?
I'm supposed to start here today... at the bau.
there's been a mistake.
I don't think so, sir. - There's definitely been a mistake.
excuse me. We're getting started.
thank you. I'll be right there.
I didn't approve this transfer, agent Prentiss.
I'm sorry for the confusion, but you've been misinformed.
But--excuse me. It's very good to see you again.
did you approve any transfer?
no. I would've discussed it.
that's what I thought. She's got the paper work to join the team.
you want me to make a call? - No. I'll make it.
St. Louis is in trouble.
they've got 2 serial killers.
this killer abducts his victims from public places, dumps them in the woods.
they consulted us months ago after the third murder.
well, now it might be up to 6.
Ellen Carroll's been missing since yesterday.
the first 2 victims were found near Mill creekin Mark Twain national forest.
no wonder it takes days to find the bodies.
the forest is 1. 5 million acres and 78, 000 of that is wilderness.
what's the story with these women?
8 victims. All prostitutes. Latest is Marci Mitchell.
she was killed last night with a 0. 44 magnum.
all are tied to a serial shooter claiming responsibility.
he's contacted Jim Meyers, a reporter at the Missouri herald.
so he's not getting the attention he think she deserves.
he signs it the hollow man, names himself for the press.
why hollow man? What, he feel empty inside or something?
he uses hollow pointbullets.
no one even knew this guy existed until he sent this letter.
well, he's killed more victims, but look who he's chosen.
hundreds of victims go unnoticed because they're social outcasts and never make the front page.
when Mill creek kills, the hollow man shoots another prostitute.
so one doesn't want to be outdone by the other.
sounds like sibling rivalry to me.
they've been killing independently of each other for a year now.
each kill they're learning something...from the other.
elbert Hubbert once wrote, " if men could only know each other, they would neither idolize nor hate. "
thank you.
what's wrong?
did you know there are roughly 30 serial killers at large in the U. S.A at any given time?
it's an incredibly rare occurrence to have them operating in the same city.
how many times has that happened? - To my knowledge, 3 times.
there was a guy killing at the same time as the son of Sam.
and then again in New Orleans, and most recently with the Phoenix murders.
serial shooters are typically loners.
this guy likes to kill at night.
his victims are prostitutes, so he may lack confidence with women or have poor social skills.
no rape. The guy could be impotent.
he's wanna be a tough guy.
it's not hard to be tough holding a 0. 44.
the gun gives him power and lets him maintain distance from the kill.
this guy doesn't want to touch the bodies with his hands.
mill creek killer.
hunts during the day, targets educated, middle-class women.
he'd have to look and act like they do.
the women die from blunt force head traumas.
this guy wants to be close, he wants to feel the life leave their bodies.
these guys are polar opposites.
just like their victims. They live in the same city but they're worlds apart.
I'm gonna see if the shooter's victims have any families I can talk to.
that's a good idea. I'm already familiar with the Mill creek case.
Reid, can you take a look at the letter for handwriting analysis and psycho linguistics?
of course. - Looks like I'm with you.
I'll go ahead and talk with Ellen Carroll's husband.
I'm meeting Jim Meyers, the reporter from the Missouri herald.
well, tell him not to write about the hollow man.
if we want to draw the shooter out, best way to do that is to act like he doesn't exist.
I'd feel much better when you find Ellen.
Mr. Carroll, believe me, we are trying.
you know, when you have kids, you become so fixated on where they areand what they're doing, you don't think you need to worry about your spouse.
I understand your wife is a partner at a law firm.
now aside from work, taking care of the family, does she make timef or herself?
she's an avid runner, participates in the st. Louis marathon every year.
is she shy, nervous about meeting new people?
ever since we had Katie, I'd say she's much more trusting.
you don't remember her talking to anyone you don't know at that playground?
no. No one.
how did I not see someone take my wife?
Mr. Carroll, the man who did this, somehow he just fits right in.
he doesn't look or sound like he doesn't belong.
Oh, hey, little lady.
Hey.
she keeps asking me, when her mommy's coming home.
I don't know what to say.
I missed you.
you are so beautiful.
agents Hotchner and Reid, FBI.
what do you want? - We'd like to talk to you.
hold that badge up again.
we're here to talk to you about Marcie Mitchell.
I'm her mother. - I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am.
what's this?
they're for me. Take your brother inside.
is this about mom? - I said inside.
you gonna judge me or ask questions?
is there anyone who can help you with the kids?
is that what you came here for?
ma'am, we've just been assigned your daughter's case.
we're in the process of gathering information, but so far no witnesses have come forward.
well, around here guns go off like those damn car alarms--every 15 minutes.
nobody's stupid enough to talk, nobody cares.
we do.
you wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for them.
heinous crimes against upstanding members of the community.
nobody writes about prostitutes being shot because they won't admit they think they'recleaning up the place.
you're right.
cases like your daughter's usually go unsolved.
the problem is people aren't looking for them because they don't know that they're missing.
part of her job was to stay below the radar.
doesn't mean she was any less important.
she made bad choices.
but she was a good person.
she loved those boys.
whoever shot her should pay for what they did.
so don't come in here and say you're sorry.
just do something about it.
we will, Ma'am.
Hi. You must be agent Sheridan?
agent Jareau. - Hi.
really appreciate you coming so quickly. - Yeah.
why don't you set up in here?
Oh, wow. You've got lots of evidence for the Mill creek killer case.
what about the hollow man? - Right here.
there's been at least 8 women shot. This is all we've got?
you know these cases don't generate much evidence.
all we have at the scene are a couple of bullets and no one's talking.
well, hopefully, we can change that.
agent Jareau, there's a reporter here to see you.
thank you. Excuse me. - Sure.
Jim Meyers. Hi. Agent Jareau. We spoke on the phone.
Hi. Thanks for stopping by.
sure. Here's that letter I faxed to you.
Oh, great.
so, did the hollow manshoot those prostitutes because I wrote about the Mill creek victims?
he would've killed them anyway.
but right now he'slooking for recognition. That's why he's contacted you.
but I'm not in any danger.
I mean, I don't want to be staring down the barrel of a gun.
right now he needs you. You're his only hope to get on that front page.
you know, I had no idea I could get on a serial killer's radar by writing about another one.
we're going to ask that you not print anything relating to the hollow man or the women he's killed.
don't those victims deserve just as much ink as those other women?
of course they do.
but we need the shooter to keep communicating with you.
and if you satisfy his need for attention, he could disappear, and I'm sorry.
we just can't take that chance.
excuse me, agent Jareau?
we just found Ellen Carroll's body.
agents Gideon, Morgan, this is agent Sheridan.
how are you? - Forgive me.
how far is the abduction site from these woods?
about 40 miles or so.
he tried to hide it pretty well. He covers the body very carefully.
must feel remorse for killing them.
this lipstick's been applied recently. It's still moist.
look at her hair. It's been brushed, put behind her ears.
she was abducted, what, an hour from here? Dragged through these woods?
her hair would not look like that.
so he keeps her safe from the elements and then comes back for the body.
that's why he chooses a secondary location that's so remote.
this isn't about remorse. - No.
he wants to be alone with her. - Needs his privacy.
you never noticed the hair or the make up before?
no. Maybe it was the timing.
she was found within 24 hours, and the others had already succumbed to the elements.
sex acts with dead bodies are rare occurrences.
however, bundy did it regularly.
so how is this going to help us to catch him?
now we know he has a ritual. He needs to defile the bodies.
next time we'll be here waiting for him.
sixth Victim Falls to Mill Creek Killer
we're off-duty just like you.
2 victims at once. That's a first for him.
you think he went out looking to kill more than one woman, or is it just happens by chance?
he chose a different hunting ground.
Yes, we're in an alley, but we're behind an expensive hotel in a nice neighborhood.
you get a different class of prostitute, ones that don't walk the street alone.
he was looking for a challenge.
question is, what gave him the confidence to stray out of his comfort zone?
make sure to runt hat for prints.
he displayed the newspaper between them.
he took the time when he could've just tossed it aside.
it's deliberate. He wants us to know he's angry.
angry enough to change his M. O.
I heard there was a double homicide this morning.
was it hollow man?
agents are confirming that now. - I've written about him.
there's no guarantee that he would've stopped killing if you would've given into his demands.
in fact, media attention could've fueled him to kill more.
we don't know that for sure.
this is all just a guessing game, isn't it?
no. It's behavioral analysis.
we're dealing with an offender who believes that murdering people is a good way to become famous.
all I know is that you told me to ignore him and he takes 2 lives.
if I dismiss this double homicide, what happens tomorrow?
we won't know until then.
too bad we couldn't trace any prints from the newspaper.
what have you got?
he only sent this to an individual, which shows he's not confident enough to initiate contact with the masses.
emotional indicators are analyzed through slants.
the shooter maintains vertical, narrow-lettered writing, both signs of repression.
and the pressure, if you look closely, is excessively heavy, which showsthat he's uptight and can easily overreact.
you got all that from his handwriting?
graphology is an effective and reliable indicator of personality and behavior.
my writing's always different.
that's because it expresses your emotions at that given time, just like your facial expressions parallel the way you're feeling while you're speaking.
I'm surprised this guy writes in cursive.
his message is so clear. I would've thought he'd print everything.
actually, his connected writing shows that he deals with problems in a practica land direct manner.
like shooting someone. - Exactly.
the hollow man uses simple statements, all first person.
for example, "I won't be ignored."
he's obviously tired of feeling this way.
it's quite possible he's got a job in solitude or one that he feels strips him of his identity.
his job might require him to wear a uniform, something that shows absolutely no individuality.
or he may be over qualified for his menial job and feels that he doesn't get the respect that he necessarily deserves.
but today he's killed 2 women, which tells us he's growing confident.
this makes him unpredictable and dangerous.
and because he has no physical contact with his victims, it's going to make him that much harder to catch.
we have more informationon the Mill creek killer because he spends a lot of time with his victims before and after his kills.
because his victims willingly follow him in broad daylight, he appears harmless.
he's most likely handsome. - Handsome?
Yes. These women wouldn't follow an unattractive man. They just wouldn't.
he's handsome, and he's got the social skills to trick his victims.
those who know him well, they'd be shocked to learn that he's the man that we're after.
he's been able to get his victims away from family, friends.
obviously, this makes him feel powerful.
if this guy is so smart, why would he risk driving his victims from the abduction site to the woods?
because of the ritual.
it's become the most important thing to him.
dominates his thoughts. Bullets provide the privacy he needs.
the hollow man is motivated by external pressures.
this is a guy who simply wants attention.
the Mill creek killer, on the other hand, he's driven by internal forces.
he's a sexually motivated offender.
now, this makes him a lot more predictable but don't think for a second it makes him any easier to catch.
where are you?
excuse me.
Meredith Dale. 25.
she was supposed to meet her friend for a bike ride but disappeared.
disappeared when? - An hour ago.
how can we be sure it's him? - Well, look at her.
she's his type physically, she vanishes into the air.
it's got the Mill creek's M. O. All over it.
I'll set up road blocks in and out of the forest.
well, based on the other timelines, we have to assume he's hiding her body right now.
best chance of catching him is to find Meredith Dale's body and sit tight.
we know he'll be back.
I'm going to need you to step out of your vehicle.
what's going on here, officer? - Just routine check.
can you open your back? - Uh, yeah, sure.
many people come through here today?
what are you doing up here? - Went for a hike.
no water, no supplies?
my boots are all I need.
that it?
that's it. - Ok.
what if these dump sites aren't random?
the bodies were scattered all over.
look at this. There's no pattern.
no, I see that, but we're talking about a lot of area to cover here.
he had to have some kind of plan going into these woods.
must have done his homework.
OK. The first body was found deep into the woods.
that's a 3-hour carrier from the city.
the first time, he's more careful in disposing of her.
her body was discovered by a forest ranger 5 days after the abduction.
and all the other victims--look at this - they follow the same pattern.
what are you saying? You think he works up there?
he might.
all I do know for sure is that he has to be familiar enough with these woods to know when a ranger is on duty.
he knew precisely when and where to drop the bodies.
now that is an awesome place to dump a person.
come on, Garcia. - What? I'm just saying, angel fish.
a million acres converts into over 2, 300 square miles to cover.
evil knew what he was doing.
yeah? Well, now so do we.
talk to me. How's the ranger schedule break down?
OK. The national forest is divided into 6 ranger districts, which are patrolled every 3 to 5 days.
now, the Potosi-Fredricktown area must be where he's headed to next because the rangers were just there yesterday, which means they're nots cheduled to revisit it for at leastanother 3 days.
and look at that, it's the district closest to the city.
well, that makes sense. He's in a hurry.
he wants to get in and out of there without a lot of trouble.
which area has the easiest access to the main road?
that would be... Saltgrass cove.
saltgrass cove.
Yep. He'd have plenty of time to revisit her.
what? No, no. I don't want to know that. Bye-bye.
think I know where he took Meredith Dale.
brownie, come here.
damn it.
please, please.
everything needs to look the same as when he left it.
he'll come back. - He needs to see Meredith again.
this bastard has killed 7 women on my watch.
comb the scene! - Oh, no. Please, please! Stop!
let's clear the immediate area.
post yourselves along the perimeter. It's imperative that you become invisible.
he set his own trap.
what we need to do now is stake out in the woods and hunt him, just like he does his victims.
that's got to be him.
FBI! Stay down! Hands where I can see them.
OK, ok. Just take it easy.
Jim Meyers. What the hell?
you're the Mill creek killer? - What? No.
then how the hell did you get here?
I got another letter from the hollow man.
telling you exactly where to find Meredith Dale?
I swear. You can read it.
follow the cottonwood trail through saltgrass cove.
wait a minute. We just figured this out ourselves.
how can another killer know the specifics about someone else's dumpsite?
what's going on?
it's going to be all over the news.
look like the hollow man didn't give you the exclusive this time.
so our plan to catch the Mill creek killer was ruined by the hollow man?
and now the hollow man's on a high.
he hasn't pulled the trigger since he took 2 victims yesterday.
is he satisfied or is he just getting started?
we'll find out.
hollow man helps fbi find the Mill creek killer's victim.
nice. He's alerted the media and injected himself into the investigation.
he's getting the attention he's been craving.
but if the shooter really wants to get the other guy arrested, he would've called us and not the media.
he must know the Mill creek killer needs to revisit the body.
if he can't defile the woman again, the need'll become so strong, it could push him into a frenzy.
and if that happens, this guy is just a time bomb waiting to explode.
excuse me.
Hi. Look, I'm having a day.
my car won't start and I forgot my phone.
could I use yours to make a call?
Yeah. Ok. I know it's here. I just used it.
what, you know what? Forget the phone.
maybe it'll start for you.
walk with me. It's right around the corner.
no, that's ok. - No, come on.
no. No!
walk with me. - Let go of me!
now! - Let me go!
help! Help!
somebody! Somebody! Help, please!
somebody! Please!
at first he seemed so normal. - Was he handsome?
excuse me? - Was he handsome?
Yeah. He was.
actually, that's why I stopped.
when did his demeanor change?
after I refused to go to his car.
he grabbed my arm so hard I thought that it would break.
I've been watching the news about all these women being abducted, and I just started screaming.
you trusted your instincts.
because of that, you're still alive.
miss, there's a sketch artist here with us.
he can create a pretty accurate rendition from your description of this man.
would you sit with him? - Absolutely.
officer.
I'm glad you're all right. - Thank you.
well, he's becoming irrational and violent in public.
that's exactly what the hollow man wanted him to do.
well, if he doesn't find a victim soon, he'll become more dangerous.
how's that possible?
he'll drop the ruse entirely and just start grabbing women at random.
great. Thanks, man.
the witness gotta good look at the Mill creek killer.
you know, if it's the hollow man's intention to force him into a frenzy, he's getting what he wants.
he knew exactly where to find Meredith Dale's body.
he figured out the route to the dump site the same way we did.
they always say serial killers make the best profilers.
Yeah, but this guy's dead-on.
Yeah. The headline doesn't mention the shooter at all.
we talked to Jim Meyers, the reporter, asked him not to respond to the letter, he doesn't, and then the guy goes out and shoots 2 more women.
in a better part of town. - What gives him this confidence?
what's the significance of the paper at the scene?
we know he wantsto be newsworthy. He could've justtossed it aside.
instead, he displayed it.
there's something he wants us to look at. There's definitely something in the paper.
I think I figured it out.
what is it?
they're talking. In the classifieds.
classifieds, code names. This feels like an old spy movie.
it's low-tech, simple, but very effective.
they've been doing this for months, and nobody ever knew it.
this is the first one that I found. The references are what made me suspicious.
sunny, are you an artist too?
I'd love to see your work sometime. Holden.
they're characters from Catcher in the Rye.
widely accepted as a loved book of sociopaths.
mark David Chapman quoted it after killing John lennon.
deranged minds identify with Holden's alienation and detachment.
I found the initial contact. It ran in the paper unchanged for months.
we have different tastes, but I can appreciate your art. Sunny.
sunny's the hollow man. He initiated contact.
what's he getting out of it? - A mentor.
offered admiration and respect.
in return, he gains encouragement and confidence.
but when the hollow man remained unnoticedby the press, he resented his mentor and turned it into a rivalry.
hollow man became jealous.
they were both killers, but they weren't seen in the same playing field.
what else did you find?
an overwhelming area and you never get lost?
then the answer to this question.
I do my research." It's not so random when you know the area."
I like Cotton Woodin sgc.
sgc? He's talking about saltgrass cove.
he told him how to find Meredith Dale. - Why?
teaching his student a lesson.
we understand their relationship.
let's use it against them.
Hey, sweetness. Make me smile and tell me you got a name.
Oh, I got scads of them, babe, but none paid for these personal ads.
they went with cash, totally old school.
I hate it when they're smart. 2 separate accounts in good standing.
well, these guysare good. Thanks.
Garcia says they covered their tracks. How's it going in here?
Reid's imitating the hollow man's language patterns to send a message to the Mill creek killer.
he's offering condolences on losing Meredith Dale.
well, if he can't get to Meredith Dale, he's gonna need a body.
he's gonna need it real soon.
you guys worried that the hollow man's going to ruin our plan again?
he wants the Mill creek killer to get caught.
the pupil's trying to kill the teacher?
hope you're close, Reid.
you got less than an hour to meet the deadline.
you'll be surrounded.
need you to relax... as best you can.
this guy's going to want to get close to you, and he's going to want to examine you.
he's going to want to touch me?
since you're a gift, not a marked victim, he might try to make you his own.
but we're not going to let him get that far.
we need him to get close to confirm he's the killer.
there's nothing normal about this guy. Nothing.
you have any questions?
let's do this.
OK. Down you go.
close your eyes. Try to relax.
what do you think? Did it sound like the hollow man?
hopefully the Mill creek killer will buy it.
dear Holden, they say "imitation is the highest form of flattery."
since you were almost in harm's way, I thought I'd share some art.
should make you feel better. Here's my gift to you. sunny.
hello.
FBI! Get down! Stay down!
one down, one to go.
stop right here.
it's going to be tough to push through this crowd.
that's the idea.
I'm getting out. Secure a path to the door.
everyone, take a step back. Get back!
what do you have to say to the families of the women you killed?
do you have any remorse for what you've done?
you're going to hell. - You deserve to die!
I've alerted all news outlets that we'll be holding a press conference in 10 minutes.
and you have the script? - Right here.
be sure to say exactly those words.
the wording's important, JJ. - Relax.
it's not my first party, boys.
Gideon, we don't have much on Mill creek, especially if he sayshe stumbled on the body.
so what are we going to do?
I'll go try and do my job.
OK. Thanks.
you comfortable?
as comfortable as anyone can be in handcuffs.
let me see.
I'm Jason Gideon.
you know, I don't know your name or where you're from...
the only thing we do know is you're an intelligent, good-looking man with an inflated ego who happens to like killing women.
well, you had me till that last part... agent Gideon.
imagine how shocked I am, considering I haven't done anything.
I see a woman who I think is in distress in the woods and I get...pounced on.
FBI wants to interview you. Talk about your work.
we never believed we'd have you in custody.
I mean, definitely thought the hollow man would be easier to catch.
is that upsetting?
I thought the two of you were friends, that you admired each other's work and...
I don't know the hollow man.
but if I did, I'd say he sounds like an obsessed fan.
is that how you see yourself, as somebody famous?
well, from what I've read about the Mill creek killer, I'd say he's an artist.
fascination wasn't completely one-sided.
you did respond to his ads in the paper.
no one can respect what the hollow man has done.
he's got no imagination.
but he's smart.
found Meredith Dale's body, even told the media about it.
whoever taught him, taught him very well.
that's very true.
it just sounds like the student turns on the teacher.
no, no. He was protecting him.
is that what you think the hollow man was doing?
well, what else could it be?
manipulating you, gaining your trust.
when he got it, the hollow man set you up.
you were front page news. Now you'd be a footnote.
hollow man's out there, you're in here. It's all because of him.
is that what you want?
you want me to get angry to help you catch him?
that is not your problem, sir.
then what do you want?
I just have one question.
if killing those women made you an artist, the things you did to them after they were dead...what does that make you?
I mean, really it...
it just doesn't seem very artistic, does it?
you went back, you fix their make-up, you'd comb their hair.
and you visited them...
over and over and over. - I didn't do that.
if you thought you were famous before, wait until the press gets a hold of you
you shut your mouth. - Details of your visit.
shut your mouth. I never went back.
you expect me to believe that you only killed those women?
that it wasn't you who kept visiting the corpses?
we found lipstick in your hand when we caught you.
you will not tell anyone that. - Excuse me?
I said you can never say that.
you didn't visit the corpses? - No.
no, you just killed them. - Yes.
Yes. I killed them.
but...but you can't tell anyone... that I went back.
you can't do that.
the women of st. Louis can rest easy tonight...
after a long year, the Mill creek killer is in custody.
this man is highly intelligent and he uses a sophisticated rouse when luring these women in public places.
the Mill creek killer is someone the bau will want to study as one of the most complex criminals we've dealt with in years.
questions? - Yes?
what's the FBI doing about the other serial killer?
we have new information about that case.
we no longer believe the shootings are related.
yes? - What's the new information?
we believe they are isolated incidents, and we're looking into the possibility that the last 2 were copycats.
are you referring to the killer who calls himself the hollow man?
we believe the person who wrote that letter is nothing but a street thug.
we have evidence that indicates that the letter was just a prank to throw us off the investigation of the Mill creek killer.
this is no longer a bau case.
it lacks a certains ophistication, class, there's just nothing elegant about it.
that's all the questions we'll take for now. Thank you.
well, we set the bait, we'll see if he takes it.
place your coins, keys, belts in the basket.
walk this way.
walk this way.
step to the side, please.
extend your arms.
stay down.
give your weapon right now.
get up.
where is he? I want to see him right now.
you tell him the hollow man's here.
he told you to say those things about me, didn't he?
he told you to use those words.
get him out of here.
I'm no less elegant than he is.
I'm no copycat. - Shut your mouth.
I left you the newspaper! I gave you the Mill creek killer!
what else do I have to do?
go! Get him out of here!
this is the story for tomorrow.
they were our daughters, sisters, brothers, and friends.
they have every right to be remembered... and memorialized.
they didn't mentionthe shooter.
he was a nobody who wanted to be somebody by killing people and they didn't give him that.
good.
mahatma gandhi once said, " remember that allthrough history there have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they seem invincible...but in the end, they always fall. Always."
please tell me you haven't been there for the last 4 days.
I heard you were flying back tonight.
heard? How could you have heard a thing like that?
this was dropped off today.
I appreciate your interest, agent, but profiling is a specialty.
we can't just let anyone who wants to give it a whirl.
the I-80 killer? Co-eds in indiana?
Yes, I read it on the plane.
they aren't blitz attacks. This guy's organized.
he's a white male, early 30s, and a smooth talker, because even after 11 victims, he can still convince educated women who know there's a predator out there to get into his car.
how would you advise the police?
I would stake out the ranch house, a night club in gary.
they have a very popular ladies night on Thursdays.
if you look closely, you'll see that 8 out of the 11 victims went missing on a Friday morning.
so something gets this creep's motor running on Thursdays.
this isn't a whirl, agent Hotchner.
I don't know how the paperwork got screwed up or maybe you believe my parents pulled some strings, which they didn't, by the way.
I belong in this unit.
and all I'm asking you for is the chance to show you that.
I still need to look into this. I'm not promising anything.
understood.
we brief new cases every morning at 10: 00 am.
you can see facilities management about a desk.
you won't be sorry.
go ON, MUDGIE! GO ON, BOY.
Attaboy!
go ON, BOY.
come! COME!
Strauss, I'M COMING IN TO SEE YOU THIS AFTERNOON.
well, THEN CANCEL IT. I'LL BE THERE AT 2: 30.
that's IT.
come ON, BOY! COME ON!
Yeah.
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS, DAVID.
what's TO UNDERSTAND, ERIN?
you've BEEN RETIRED FOR NEARLY 10 YEARS.
B. A.U. IS A MAN DOWN. I'M OFFERING TO HELP.
you've WRITTEN... HOW MANY BOOKS?
world TOURS. SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS.
big PAYDAY PRIVATE CONSULTATIONS.
you've MADE QUITE A NAME FOR YOURSELF.
well, THIS IS GETTING BORING.
you KNOW, YOU WON'T BE IN CHARGE.
agent HOTCHNER'S THE S. A.C. AND I'LL BE SEEKING HIS ENDORSEMENT.
I'm NOT LOOKING FOR ANYONE'S PERMISSION HERE.
so YOU'RE COMING IN
in A SUBORDINATE POSITION.
is THAT A QUESTION?
the QUESTION IS, WHY?
to HELP.
a COMPLETELY SELFLESS ACT.
is THAT SO HARD TO BELIEVE?
Yes.
I MISSED YOU TOO, ERIN.
you'll MEET THE TEAM TOMORROW.
it WAS NEXT TO MY FRONT DOOR WHEN I GOT HOME, FRANK.
God, I HATE HALLOWEEN.
here YOU GO, SIR. - HALLOWEEN?
less THAN A WEEK AWAY. IT'S A PRIME TIME FOR STUPID PRANKS.
so YOU THINK IT'S JUST A PRANK?
well, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT MISSING, MICHELLE.
Where'd THEY GET A PICTURE OF ME?
it's PROBABLY ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS.
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THAT'D THINK THIS IS FUNNY.
Molly DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FUNNY.
she's THE ONE WHO TOLD ME TO COME RIGHT DOWN HERE.
if MY WIFE HAD JUST CALLED, I PROBABLY COULD HAVE SAVED YOU THE TRIP.
I'm SURE IT'S NOTHING, REALLY.
you SURE?
look...
I'll COME BY AND CHECK ON YOU AFTER WORK
and MAKE SURE YOU'RE SAFE.
I APPRECIATE THAT, FRANK.
Hey. SERVING AND PROTECTING IS WHAT I DO.
no, NO, I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS FUNNY, MOLLY.
I SAID SOMEONE MIGHT
I--I KNOW SHE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.
that's WHY I'M HERE.
no. NO, I DON'T THINK IT'S WEIRD SHE DIDN'T CALL
look, I'M HERE ALREADY.
all THE LIGHTS ARE OUT.
she--she PROBABLY WENT TO BED EARLY.
I'll HAVE HER CALL YOU.
Yeah, 20 MINUTES. I LOVE YOU, TOO.
this WASN'T FUNNY THE FIRST TIME.
Michelle, IT'S FRANK!
Oh, MY GOD.

can't BELIEVE YOU WANT TO COME BACK HERE.
well, I'LL LET THE TWO OF YOU CATCH UP.
if YOU NEED ANYTHING, I'M IN MY OFFICE.
Thanks.
so HOW LONG'S IT BEEN?
dinner, ALMOST 3 YEARS AGO.
but THE LAST TIME I WAS IN THE B. A.U.
you WERE SHARING A DESK WITH 2 OTHER AGENTS IN THAT GOD-AWFUL BUNKER WE WERE IN.
I REMEMBER.
Congratulations. - THANKS.
well, THERE'S ONE JUST LIKE THIS NEXT DOOR IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.
I'm READY TO GIVE THE BRIEFING.

maybe YOU GUYS CAN TALK ON THE JET.
Oh, YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT. - THE JET?
we HAVE A JET NOW. - ARE YOU SERIOUS?
Yeah. IT COMES IN PRETTY HANDY. COME ON. J. J.'s WAITING.
Carrollton, TEXAS, IS A SUBURB JUST OUTSIDE OF DALLAS.
4 DAYS AGO, MICHELLE COLUCCI FOUND THIS FLIER ON HER FRONT DOOR.
she FOUND IT?
meaning SHE WASN'T ACTUALLY MISSING?
yet.
she TOOK THE FLIER TO A FRIEND'S HUSBAND,
detective YARBROUGH, AT THE CARROLLTON P. D.
who TOLD HER IT WAS PROBABLY JUST A HALLOWEEN PRANK, AND HE SENT HER HOME.
well, I DON'T BLAME HIM.
Halloween BRINGS OUT THE FOOL IN EVERYONE.
still, HE STOPPED BY MICHELLE'S HOUSE LATER
to CHECK ON HER.
the DOOR WAS OPEN, AND WHEN HE WENT INSIDE, HE FOUND THIS.
he STILL THOUGHT MAYBE IT COULD BE SOME KIND OF A PRANK,
until YESTERDAY.
Michelle WAS FOUND FLOATING IN A SMALL CREEK JUST OUTSIDE OF CARROLLTON.
she HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED...
and HER FACE HAD BEEN REMOVED.
removed? IT WASN'T ANIMALS OR FISH?
the DALLAS COUNTY M. E.
say THAT THE EDGES OF THE WOUNDS
were SMOOTH, NOT TORN.
a VERY SHARP INSTRUMENT HAD BEEN USED.
he ALSO FOUND WATER IN HER LUNGS.
Oh, MY GOD!
what IS THAT?
technical ANALYST PENELOPE GARCIA,
this IS SSA DAVID ROSSI.
is IT GONE, J. J?
Yeah, YEAH, YEAH. YOU'RE SAFE.
OK.
just TO, UM...
Carrollton, TEXAS, HAS NEARLY 117, 000 RESIDENTS,
a DIVERSE POPULATION WITH A...
it's ALL IN THERE.
I'm SORRY.
very HAPPY TO MEET YOU, SIR.
I'll BE IN MY OFFICE.
sorry.
she's DIFFERENT.
you HAVE NO IDEA.
uh, SO, THE UNSUB
tells HER SHE'S GOING TO GO MISSING
to PSYCHOLOGICALLY TORTURE HER,
then TORTURES HER PHYSICALLY.
textbook SADIST.
a SOPHISTICATED ONE.
that's ELABORATE.
number ONE.
that PARTICULAR MASK
is KNOWN AS A FALSE FACE.
it's MOST COMMONLY WORN DURING HALLOWEEN AND MARDI GRAS.
creepy. I REST MY CASE.
false FACE.
her FACE-- HE MOCKS IT,
then DESTROYS IT.
Oh, AND, HOTCH
local MEDIA HAS THE STORY. IT BROKE BIG.
tell CARROLLTON WE'LL BE THERE
first THING IN THE MORNING.
let's STOP THIS ONE AT ONE.
Yes, SIR.
if YOU WANT TO TAKE SOME TIME TO GET SITUATED,
maybe START ON THE NEXT CASE?
I'm NOT BACK TO GET SITUATED, HOTCH, I'M HERE TO WORK.
okay.
everybody GET YOUR THINGS TOGETHER.
we're GOING TO TEXAS.
Abbey, WHAT'S THE LATEST?
police SOURCES TELL ME THEY HAVE NO LEADS IN THE CASE THEY ARE CALLING THE "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" MURDERS.
where THE HELL DO YOU GET THIS STUFF?
no, NOT YOU, AGENT JAREAU. THE TELEVISION.
the PRESS IS SAYING WE GAVE THIS THING A STUPID NAME,
like IT'S SOME KIND OF DAMN GAME OR SOMETHING.
JUST...CALL ME WHEN YOU ALL GET IN TOMORROW.
I'll TAKE YOU WHEREVER YOU NEED TO GO.
all RIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.
Abbey, DO WE KNOW WHEN THIS FLYER FIRST SURFACED?
we HAVE HEARD REPORTS THAT MS. COLUCCI RECEIVED THIS FLIER LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON WHEN SHE RETURNED HOME FROM WORK.
score!
never SAW THE POINT AT THROWING AN EGG AT ANYTHING.
or EVEN THE CONNECTION TO HALLOWEEN, FOR THAT MATTER.
what THE HELL...
Oh, MY GOD.
that's ME.
Oh, MY GOD!
let's GO OVER VICTIMOLOGY.
would YOU LIKE TO JOIN US, DAVE?
Reid, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
uh, MICHELLE COLUCCI
was SINGLE, LIVED ALONE,
no BOYFRIEND AND NO EX-HUSBAND.
dating?
there's NOTHING IN THE REPORTS.
she WAS AN ARCHITECT.
friends AND CO-WORKERS SAY SHE'S A CLASS WORKAHOLIC.
basically A LONER WHO RARELY WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE.
so SHE'S EXTREMELY LOW RISK.
if IT WASN'T SOMEONE SHE KNEW PERSONALLY, IT'S POSSIBLE SHE WAS BEING STALKED.
interesting. - WHAT'S THAT?
Oh, I'M JUST THINKING OUT LOUD.
something TO ADD?
no. SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
well, SHE'S PRETTY.
it COULD BE THAT THE UNSUB MET HER CASUALLY AND...
made HER PART OF SOME KIND OF FANTASY.
and HE TRIESO ACT ON IT AND SHE REJECTS HIM?
so HE TORTURES HER, OUT OF ANGER?
masks OFTEN REPRESENT A STATE OF MIND.
this ONE'S BLANK, EXPRESSIONLESS.
doesn't REALLY COINCIDE WITH ANGER.
Reid, IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HE DID THIS
out OF ANYTHING LESS THAN RAGE.
Hey, GUYS.
what's UP? YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR US?
a LIST OF MICHELLE COLUCCI'S CLIENTS.
she DESIGNED OFFICE SPACE.
mostly BIG CORPORATE REMODELING PLANS.
no PRIVATE CLIENTS, ONE-ON-ONE CONTACT?
doesn't LOOK LIKE IT, NO.
Thanks, BABY GIRL.
Yeah.
it's RIGHT THIS WAY, MA'AM.
detective YARBROUGH?
we GOT ANOTHER FLIER THIS TIME METRO DALLAS
Enid WHITE. HER ROOMMATE CALLED DALLAS P. D. THIS MORNING.
Enid NEVER GAME HOME AFTER WALKING HER DOG LAST NIGHT.
so SHE IS MISSING.
well, HE WALLPAPERED THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH FLIERS FOR 2 BLOCKS AROUND THEIR APARTMENT.
outside. THAT'S DIFFERENT.
no ONE SAW HIM PUTTING THEM UP?
dallas P. D. IS STILL CANVASSING,
but NOTHING SO FAR.
they're WAITING FOR YOU ON THE NEW SCENE.
mind IF I KEEP THIS? - NOT AT ALL.
Morgan, YOU AND PRENTISS GO TO MICHELLE COLUCCI'S HOUSE.
J. J. AND I WILL TALK TO ENID'S ROOMMATE.
Dave, DO YOU MIND WALKING THE DISPOSAL SITE WITH THE DETECTIVE AND REID?
whatever YOU NEED.
we'll REGROUP IN AN HOUR.
these HOUSES SURE ARE CLOSE TOGETHER.
Yeah.
so HOW DO I GET A WOMAN OUT OF HER HOUSE WITHOUT ANYONE SEEING ME?
well, HE MUST HAVE BEEN WATCHING HER FOR A LONG TIME
and KNEW THAT IT WAS SAFE.
there ISN'T A LOT OF COVER ON THIS STREET.
I HAVE A VEHICLE.
bi SO I CAN WATCH WITHOUT BEING SEEN.
but NOT SO BIG ??? TO DRAW ATTENTION TO HIMSELF.
no. NEIGHBORS WILL NOTICE THERE IS A STRANGE VEHICLE
parked IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE DAY AFTER DAY, NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.
it's HUMAN NATURE. YOU WOULD NOTICE
something OUT OF PLACE IN YOUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD.
and YOU WOULD DEFINITELY NOTICE A MAN
repeatedly STANDING ON YOUR STREET.
Yeah. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
he DIDN'T WATCH FROM HERE.
as WE REPORTED EARLIER,
Enid WHITE IS STILL CONSIDERED MISSING...
big STORY.
leeches.
haven't HAD SOMETHING THIS BIG TO PLAY IN A LONG TIME.
did THE PRESS RUN WITH THE STORY ABOUT THE MASK?
mask?
a MASK WAS LEFT AT MICHELLE COLUCCI'S APARTMENT.
first TIME I'M HEARING ABOUT IT.
good. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT STAYS OURS.
Yeah.
miss WHITE'S ROOMMATE SAYS
that ENID WALKS HER DOG EVERY NIGHT AT THE SAME TIME,
takes THE SAME ROUTE, RIGHT DOWN THIS STREET.
nothing A STALKER LIKES BETTER THAN ROUTINE.
well, SHE DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS IF THIS WAS HERE BEFORE SHE WENT MISSING.
a COUPLE OF NEIGHBORS SAY THEY MAY HAVE SEEN A GUY PUTTING UP A FLIER DURING THE DAY,
but THEY REALLY COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.
all RIGHT, WELL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING WE CAN ABOUT THE VICTIM.
I KNOW YOU SENT SOME STUFF OVER TO QUANTICO,
but IT WOULD HELP US IF WE COULD INTERVIEW THE ROOMMATE OURSELVES.
we HAVE HER DOWNTOWN NOW.
OK.
Where's HER DOG?
excuse ME?
if SHE WAS ABDUCTED WHILE SHE WAS WALKING HER DOG.
Where's HER DOG?
we WENT OVER THIS AREA PRETTY THOROUGHLY.
there's NO EVIDENCE LEFT.
I JUST WANT TO STAND WHERE SHE WAS.
Dr. REID,
do WE STILL KEEP ALL THE OLD FILES
in THE FOURTH FLOOR STOREROOM?
I THINK SOME ARE UP THERE.
you KNOW, MOST OF OUR INFORMATION'S ON COMPUTER NOW.
right.
have YOU HAD A CHANCE TO GO THROUGH OUR DATA SINCE YOU'VE BEEN BACK?
not YET.
you'll BE AMAZED. THE ORIGINAL TEAM
I MEAN, YOU INTERVIEWED SOMETHING LIKE, UH, 45 SERIAL KILLERS, RIGHT?
something LIKE.
today WE HAVE INTERVIEWS WITH OVER 1, 000 OFFENDERS.
serial KILLERS, CHILD ABDUCTORS, SEX OFFENDERS
I'll GO THROUGH IT WITH YOU SOMETIME IF YOU LIKE, ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
sounds GOOD.
Michelle's BODY WAS FOUND RIGHT HERE.
I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A PRANK.
you CAN'T REALLY BLAME YOURSELF FOR THAT.
she MADE HERSELF DINNER.
excuse ME?
she HAD TIME TO MAKE HERSELF DINNER.
I MEAN SHE WAS HOME FOR A WHILE BEFORE HE...
there WAS TIME TO HELP HER.
water.
obliterates A BODY...
destroys EVIDENCE.
but YOU WEREN'T IN THE WATER THAT LONG, WERE YOU, MICHELLE?
she HAD ROCKS TIED TO HER TO WEIGH HER DOWN.
she FLOATED TO THE SURFACE BEFORE THERE WAS ANY OTHER DAMAGE.
just WHAT WAS DONE TO HER ALREADY.
the SALIENT POINT IS
that IT WAS THE FIRST THING THE UNSUB WASN'T GOOD AT.
green RIVER DUMPED MOST OF THE BODIES IN THE WATER.
but THEY WEREN'T WEIGHED DOWN.
Yeah. WE KNOW NOW IT'S 'CAUSE HE DIDN'T CARE IF THEY WERE FOUND.
he HAD NO CONNECTION TO THEM.
this IS WHERE I'D WAIT.
Yeah.
I'd NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE YOU FROM THE HOUSE.
he WAS HERE A LOT.
watching EVERYTHING SHE DID.
as WE REPORTED EARLIER, ENID WHITE IS STILL CONSIDERED...
we GOT ANYTHING?
agent ROSSI POINTED OUT
that SINCE THE VICTIMS WERE WEIGHTED DOWN,
it SUGGESTS THE UNSUB DIDN'T WANT THEM FOUND.
it SUGGESTS SOME SORT OF CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM.
detective, HOW LONG WAS MICHELLE MISSING?
she WAS FOUND ON THE FOURTH DAY.
so IF SHE WASN'T IN THE WATER LONG,
then HE HELD HER FOR 3.
I've BEEN RUNNING ALL OF ENID WHITE'S CREDIT CARDS.
And?
she MADE A PURCHASE AT 9 A. M. THIS MORNING AT A SPORTING GOODS STORE IN DALLAS.
this MORNING?
what DID SHE BUY?
a SHOTGUN.
Thanks.
male, APPROXIMATELY 6 FEET TALL.
the MAN WAS SEEN POSTING FLIERS AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE ENID WHITE WAS KNOWN TO WALK HER DOG.
the POLICE ARE STILL UNABLE TO GIVE US ANY INFORMATION AT THIS TIME, AND THEY ARE SAYING
they STILL HAVE NO POSSIBLE LEADS.
we WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU POSTED AS WE RECEIVE MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE HUNT FOR ENID WHITE...
she CAN BUY A GUN AT EASILY?
this IS TEXAS.
there's NO LICENSE OR WAITING PERIOD
for MOST RIFLES OR SHOTGUNS.
is THERE VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF GUNS SALES IN SPORTING GOODS STORES?
there's SUPPOSED TO BE.
J. J. CALL THE STORE.
find OUT IF IT WAS ENID OR THE UNSUB
using HER CREDIT CARD.
right AWAY.
detective YARBROUGH.
there's AN URGENT CALL FROM A WOMAN ON ONE.
detective YARBROUGH.
my NAME IS ENID WHITE.
where ARE YOU, ENID?
the NEWS REPORTS SAID THAT THE POLICE DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT OTHER WOMAN WHEN SHE SAW THE MISSING FLIERS.
that WAS A MISTAKE, ENID.
I HAVE A GUN.
I DON'T THINK I CAN STAY AWAKE VERY MUCH LONGER.
Enid, THIS IS AGENT HOTCHNER OF THE FBI.
we BELIEVE YOU, AND WE WANT TO HELP YOU.
can YOU TELL US WHERE YOU ARE?
el ROYALE MOTEL IN DALLAS.
it's ROOM 6.
I SAW THE FLIERS.
hurry, PLEASE. HE'S GONNA KILL ME.
don't MOVE, ENID. WE'RE ON OUR WAY.
clear.
20 MINUTES.
we WERE HERE IN 20 MINUTES.
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE LOST HER.
we MAY NOT HAVE LOST HER. HE KEPT MICHELLE FOR 4 DAYS.
but WE GOT NOTHING.
that's NOT TRUE. LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SCENES.
what DO YOU MEAN? THERE'S THE MASKS, THE FLIERS.
Yeah, BUT THESE FLIERS WEREN'T TACKED UP,
they WERE JUST THROWN AROUND THE ROOM.
so?
he LEFT IN A HURRY LIKE HE KNEW WE WERE COMING.
OK, THIS WAS UNDER THE BED.
972 AREA CODE.
that's CARROLLTON. THE HOTLINE NUMBER.
she USED A CELL PHONE.
you CAN GET A CELL INTERCEPTOR AT ANY ELECTRONICS STORE.
you CAN?
Yeah. THEY DON'T COST THAT MUCH.
he PROBABLY SAT RIGHT OUT HERE
and HEARD EVERYTHING SHE SAID.
but IF HE FOLLOWED HER HERE FROM DALLAS,
why WAIT TILL SHE CALLS US TO MOVE ON HER?
to MAKE SURE IT WAS THE POLICE WHO FOUND THE MASK.
we NEED TO GATHER YOUR MEN AND GIVE A PROFILE.
he's A WHITE MALE.
his SHOE PRINTS HAVE BEEN EXAMINED
and PUT HIM AT ABOUT 5'11," 165.
so WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO ANYONE
of AVERAGE WEIGHT AND HEIGHT.
exactly.
speak AND BE RECOGNIZED BY YOUR EMPRESS, MORTAL.
is THIS THE TECHNICAL ANALYST GIRL?
who's THIS?
Dr. REID SAID THIS WAS YOUR DIRECT LINE FROM THE TEAM.
it IS.
this IS AGENT DAVE ROSSI. WE MET YESTERDAY.
Oh! OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
I'm SORRY--SIR.
uh, YEAH, I ALREADY STARTED PROCESSING
the FOOTPRINT INFORMATION ON MICHELLE COLUCCI
no, NO, NO. THIS IS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
Oh.
all THE PAST OPEN CASES THE B. A.U. WORKED ON
are ON COMPUTER NOW?
most OF THEM.
there MAY BE A FEW LEFT TO CATALOG.
if I GIVE YOU A VICTIM'S NAME,
could YOU FIND THE OLD RECORDS?
Oh, RECORDS ARE MY SPECIALTY, SIR.
the ORIGINAL CASE
I'm GOING BACK 20 YEARS.
won't BE A PROBLEM.
the NAME IS GALEN.
Diana AND RICHARD GALEN.
they HAD 3 CHILDREN.
OK. I WILL GET BACK TO YOU SUPER FAST.
Scout's HONOR.
no, NO, UM, JUST PUT A FILE TOGETHER.
I'll GET IT WHEN I GET BACK.
it's REALLY NO PROBLEM, SIR. I COULD JUST SEND IT
not NECESSARY.
I'll LOOK AT IT WHEN I GET BACK.
and LET'S KEEP THIS BETWEEN US,
if YOU DON'T MIND.
for NOW.
OK.
thank YOU.
my PLEASURE ENTIRELY, SIR.
there's A SOPHISTICATION AND PATIENCE IN WHAT THIS UNSUB DOES.
that SUGGESTS A LEVEL OF MATURITY.
we BELIEVE THIS PUTS HIS AGE
in THE MID-30s TO 40s RANGE.
Michelle COLUCCI WAS TAKEN FROM THE PRIMARY CRIME SCENE
and DISPOSED OF AT THE TERTIARY CRIME SCENE 4 DAYS LATER.
that MEANS SHE WAS HELD SOMEWHERE FOR AT LEAST 3 DAYS.
you CAN'T REALLY JUST HOLD A VICTIM ANYWHERE FOR DAYS ON END,
so HE MOST LIKELY HAS ACCESS TO A HOUSE OF SOME KIND.
and HE'S ALSO FAIRLY TECH SAVVY.
the FLIERS WERE MADE ON A COMPUTER.
and IT'S PROBABLE THAT HE USED A DEVICE
to INTERCEPT ENID WHITE'S PHONE CALL.
witnesses IN ENID WHITE'S NEIGHBORHOOD
say THEY MAY HAVE SEEN A WHITE MAN PUTTING UP FLIERS,
but NONE OF THEM COULD DESCRIBE HIM,
even WITH ALL THE MEDIA ATTENTION THIS CASE HAS RECEIVED.
great.
actually, WHAT THAT TELLS US
is THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING REMARKABLE ABOUT THIS MAN.
he IS EXCEEDINGLY AVERAGE.
as YOU SAID, DETECTIVE YARBROUGH, AVERAGE HEIGHT, AVERAGE BUILD.
it EXTENDS TO HIS PROFESSIONAL LIFE AS WELL.
he MOST LIKELY WORKS IN A FIELD WHERE HE DOESN'T STAND OUT,
doesn't REALLY MAKE A MARK.
his LACK OF DISTINCTION IS PART OF HIS PSYCHOPATHY.
we HAVE HUNDREDS OF INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE EVERY DAY.
most OF THOSE INVOLVE SOMEONE OVERLOOKING SOMEONE ELSE.
most OF US DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO BEING IGNORED,
but TO THIS KIND OF UNSUB,
each OVERSIGHT IS INTENTIONAL.
especially WHEN IT COMES FROM HIS OBJECT OF SEXUAL DESIRE.
he BEGINS TO OBSESS OVER HER
until SHE'S ALL HE CAN THINK ABOUT.
and THE RAGE BUILDS UNTIL HE HAS TO ATTACK THAT PERSON.
so HE'S PISSED OFF THAT NOBODY NOTICES HIM?
have YOU SEEN ME?
wait. THAT'S NOT ABOUT THE WOMEN?
no. THE MASKS ARE ABOUT THE WOMEN
number ONE, NUMBER 2.
the FLIERS PROBABLY REFER TO HIM.
removing HIS VICTIMS' FACES
transfers HIS FEELINGS OF BEING IGNORED INTO A MISSION
and IT GIVES HIM A SENSE OF POWER.
and THE POWER CAN MAKE HIM ARROGANT,
but IT DOESN'T MAKE HIM NOTABLE.
so HOW THE HELL DO WE CATCH AN INVISIBLE MAN?
I'm PRETTY SURE WE CAN GET HIM TO CONTACT YOU.
what?
well, THE CRIME SCENES SHOW
he WANTS TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE TO THE POLICE.
he ISN'T GOING PUBLIC.
hopefully, BY PLAYING ON HIS ANGER...
J. J. HOW'D THEY GET THAT?
not FROM ME. I-- HOTCH, I CALLED ALL THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS
and I STRESSED WITHHOLDING THE MASK.
I CALLED THEM.
what?
I SAID THE FBI THINKS THE MASKS MEAN
he's IMPOTENT.
can SPEAK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
why WOULD YOU DO THAT?
it'll MAKE HIM CONTACT US.
he's SCREAMING FOR IT.
we AREN'T PREPARED.
prepared?
we NEED TO SET UP A TRAP AND TRACE.
trap AND TRACE?
they NEVER STAY ON THE PHONE LONG ENOUGH FOR THAT.
Dave, THEY'RE A LOT FASTER THAN THEY USED TO BE.
we ALSO NEED TO PREP THE DETECTIVE ON WHAT TO SAY TO HIM.
he's NOT GONNA WANT TO TALK TO THE DETECTIVE.
he's GONNA WANT TO TALK TO THE FBI.
we DON'T STEP OVER THE LOCAL POLICE LIKE THAT.
they CALLED US IN.
Yes, BUT IF THE PERCEPTION IS THAT WE'RE TO EMBARRASS THE LOCALS BY TELLING THE MEDIA THAT WE'RE GONNA FIX THINGS,
then THEY'LL STOP CALLING US.
relax, HOTCH. I'VE GOT THIS.
you SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM, DAVE.
there IS NO I. WE FUNCTION AS A TEAM.
I've BEEN DOING THIS BEFORE YOU WERE OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL,
probably BEFORE THE REST OF YOUR TEAM
was IN SCHOOL AT ALL.
I KNOW THAT.
things HAVE CHANGED.
the BELLS AND WHISTLES CHANGED.
an UNSUB IS STILL AN UNSUB,
and I KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH AN UNSUB.
no, DAVE, IT'S NOT JUST THAT.
what?
Garcia FOUND SOMETHING.
Garcia, TALK TO US.
so, MICHELLE COLUCCI RECENTLY DREW UP THE PLANS FOR A REMODEL OF 3 FLOORS OF A COMPANY CALLED TECHCO COMMUNICATIONS.
it's A HIGH-TECH COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY
in DOWNTOWN DALLAS.
and ENID WHITE?
worked THERE UNTIL 2 MONTHS AGO.
he's ON 2.
the UNSUB?
demanded TO SPEAK TO THE FBI.
this IS FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT
you CALLED ME IMPOTENT.
did I?
I'm NOT IMPOTENT.
why ARE YOU WHISPERING?
you LIED.
you LIED.
is SOMEONE AROUND YOU?
are YOU AT WORK?
you HAVE TO TELL THE NEWS THE TRUTH.
I'll GET YOU ON THE NEWS, THEN YOU CAN CORRECT ME YOURSELF.
no, YOU, YOU,
you CORRECT IT.
by THE WAY, I WAS, UM,
looking AT THE POLICE SECURITY TAPES FOR THE DAY MICHELLE COLUCCI WENT MISSING.
what?
you WATCHED HER LONG ENOUGH
to KNOW SHE DIDN'T HAVE VISITORS.
she WAS A LONER.
yet YOU KNEW THAT DETECTIVE YARBROUGH WAS COMING OVER.
you MUST HAVE BEEN RIGHT HERE IN THIS STATION WHEN HE TOLD HER.
now, YOUR FACE IS GONNA BE ON ONE OF THOSE TAPES,
and WHEN I FIND IT,
I'm GONNA PAPER THIS CITY WITH IT,
just LIKE YOU DID WITH THOSE WOMEN.
everyone WILL SEE IT.
they WON'T BE ABLE TO IGNORE YOU NOW.
but YOU WON'T INSPIRE FEAR,
you'll INSPIRE HATRED AND RIDICULE,
because THE ONLY POWER SOMEONE LIKE YOU HAS
is A MASK,
and ONCE THAT MASK IS REMOVED,
you'll BE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
a LOSER!
you JUST SIGNED ENID WHITE'S DEATH WARRANT.
lieutenant, I NEED YOU TO LOCK THE TECHCO BUILDING DOWN TIGHT.
nobody IN, NOBODY OUT. IT'S VITAL.
Rossi, YOU REALLY THINK THE UNSUB'S
still GONNA BE THERE AFTER THAT CALL?
OFOURSE. HE THINKS HE HAS ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD.
you THINK THEY GOT AN IMAGE OFF THE POLICE SECURITY CAMERA YET?
the SECURITY CAMERA DOESN'T WORK. I LIED ABOUT THAT.
you LIED ABOUT THAT?
he DOESN'T KNOW.
Dave, THAT WAS INCREDIBLY RECKLESS.
Hotch, HE DIDN'T WEIGH THE BODY DOWN WELL.
what DO YOU MEAN?
he DIDN'T WANT MICHELLE FOUND SO QUICKLY.
he SCREWED THAT UP.
this KIND OF GUY,
when HE PLANS SOMETHING, IF HE HAS THE TIME,
if HE'S IN CONTROL, HE'S METICULOUS.
but BEING ON THE EDGE OF THE RIVER, OUT IN THE OPEN,
he WAS NOT IN CONTROL. HE WAS IN A HURRY,
and HE MADE A MISTAKE.
that's WHAT YOU'RE HOPING.
trust ME. WITH AN UNSUB LIKE THIS,
you NEED TO THROW HIM OFF HIS GAME.
his HAND NEEDS TO BE FORCED.
I KNOW THAT, DAVE, BUT THE POINT IS, YOU DID IT BY FORCING OURS.
is THE BUILDING SEALED?
top TO BOTTOM.
Yarbrough, MAKE SURE IT STAYS THAT WAY.
Garcia, WHICH FLOORS DID MICHELLE CARLUCCI REMODEL?
got IT--7, 8, 9.
Morgan, TAKE 7. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A RANK-AND-FILE EMPLOYEE
who MADE A SCENE IN THE LAST 20 MINUTES OR WAS HERE AND GONE.
Prentiss, 8, REID, 9.
don't APPROACH HIM. JUST...TRY TO GET A NAME,
maybe A PICTURE.
he's SOMEWHERE IN THIS LOBBY.
Why?
can't YOU FEEL IT?
display YOUR CREDENTIALS.
he THINKS WE KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE.
Yeah, REID?
got HIM.
sir?
sir!
we HAVE YOUR ADDRESS, MAX.
there's NO PLACE TO GO.
this IS AGENT ROSSI, MAX.
if YOU DO WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,
you WON'T GET TO TELL THEM I LIED.
come ON, MAX,
slowly PUT YOUR HANDS
on TOP OF YOUR HEAD.
listen TO HIM, MAX.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING
and YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT.
it DOESN'T HAVE TO END HERE, MAX.
please.
down!
you OK?
Yeah.
he's GONE.
what ABOUT ENID WHITE?
we HAVE HIS HOME ADDRESS.
is SHE THERE?
let's HOPE SO.
you SAID OUT THERE,
the TEAM SHARES EVERYTHING.
that's RIGHT.
there IS NO I?
Uh-huh.
it SEEMS A BIG THING TO WITHHOLD.
separating FROM YOUR WIFE, YOUR CHILD.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
you USED TO CALL HALEY 10 TIMES A DAY.
we've BEEN TOGETHER 48 HOURS,
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU CALL HER ONCE.
haven't MENTIONED HER.
and YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME NOW.
what's YOUR POINT?
I GUESS YOU'RE JUST NOT USED TO SHARING.
my PRIVATE LIFE IS NOT THE SAME AS A CASE.
I'm JUST SAYING,
sharing IS A LEARNED SKILL.
you KNOW...
when THIS ALL STARTED...
there WERE ONLY A FEW OF US.
we'd GO OUT ON THE ROAD ALONE.
we DIDN'T...
groupthink.
we DON'T GROUPTHINK.
we THINK AS INDIVIDUALS,
and WE SHARE THE THOUGHTS WITH THE REST OF THE TEAM.
we DON'T WRITE THEM DOWN IN A LITTLE NOTEBOOK AND KEEP THEM TO OURSELVES.
all THIS-- THE PEOPLE WE'VE HELPED,
the ONES WE'VE PUT AWAY,
IT'S...BECAUSE OF YOU
and THE GUYS WHO STARTED THIS UNIT,
who BELIEVED WHEN NOBODY ELSE DID THAT THERE WAS WAY OF UNDERSTANDING THESE CRIMES AND GETTING AHEAD OF THEM.
And?
I DON'T SEE THAT YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO PROVE.
you DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK.
I KNOW THAT.
so WHY?
maybe I HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS.
go on, Mudgie! Go on, boy.
Attaboy!
go on, boy.
come! Come!
Strauss, I'm coming in to see you this afternoon.
well, then cancel it. I'll be there at 2: 30.
that's it. Come on, boy!
come on! Yeah.
I really don't understand this, David.
what's to understand, Erin?
you've been retired for nearly 10 years.
B.A.U. Is a man down.
I'm offering to help.
you've written... how many books?
world tours.
speaking engagements.
big payday private consultations.
you've made quite a name for yourself.
well, this is getting boring.
you know, you won't be in charge.
agent Hotchner's the S.A.C. And I'll be seeking his endorsement.
I'm not looking for anyone's permission here.
so you're coming in in a subordinate position.
is that a question? - The question is, why?
to help.
a completely selfless act.
is that so hard to believe?
Yes.
I missed you too, Erin.
you'll meet the team tomorrow.
Carrollton, TEXAS
have YOU SEEN ME?
it was next to my front door when I got home, Frank.
God, I hate Halloween.
here you go, sir. - Halloween?
police Department, CARROLLTON, TEXAS
less than a week away.
it's a prime time for stupid pranks.
so you think it's just a prank?
well, you're obviously not missing, Michelle.
Where'd they get a picture of me?
it's probably one of your friends.
I don't know anybody that'd think this is funny.
Molly didn't think it was funny.
she's the one who told me to come right down here.
if my wife had just called, I probably could have saved you the trip.
I'm sure it's nothing, really.
you sure?
look...
I'll come by and check on you after work and make sure you're safe.
I appreciate that, Frank.
Hey. Serving and protecting is what I do.
no, no, I didn't say it was funny, Molly.
I said someone might
I--I know she's your best friend. That's why I'm here.
no. No, I don't think it's weird she didn't call
look, I'm here already.
all the lights are out.
she--she probably went to bed early.
I'll have her call you.
Yeah, 20 minutes. I love you, too.
this wasn't funny the first time.
Michelle, it's Frank!
Oh, my god.
federal Bureau of Investigation QUANTICO, VIRGINIA
erasmus wrote, what else is the whole life of mortals but a sort of comedy, in which the various actors, disguised by various costumes and masks, walk on and play each one his part, until the manager waves them off the stage?
I'm waiting for you!
happy all hallows eve, folks.
to paraphrase from Celtic mythology, tomorrow night all order is suspended, and the barriers between the natural and the supernatural are temporarily removed!
see, that right there is why Halloween creeps me out.
you're scared of Halloween?
I didn't say I was scared, I said I was crept out.
there's a difference there, youngster. You should look it up.
what creeps you out about it?
I don't know. People wearing masks.
I don't like folks in disguises.
that's the best thing about halloween. You can be anyone you want to be.
Nah, I'm pretty good just being me.
Yeah, why is it that neither of those points of view surprise me?
you know what, though? On the flip side, it does provide a pretty good reason to cozy up with a scary flick and a little halloween honey.
Halloween honey. Now I'm creeped out.
guys, he's here.
agent Hotchner.
I'm sure you remember... - Dave.
how are you, Aaron?
I'm good. I'm great. - I would say so.
saw you on TV last week.
can't believe you want to come back here.
well, I'll let the two of you catch up.
if you need anything, I'm in my office. - Thanks.
so how long's it been?
dinner, almost 3 years ago.
but the last time I was in the B.A.U.
you were sharing a desk with 2 other agents in that god-awful bunker we were in.
I remember.
Congratulations. - Thanks.
well, there's one just like this next door if you're interested.
I'm ready to give the briefing.
agent Jareau, this is S.S.A. David Rossi.
Hi. Everyone calls me J. J.
it is such an honor to meet you, sir.
I've heard a lot about you. - Thank you.
and what's your function here?
I'm the communications coordinator and liaison.
pretty much the go-between for the team and the rest of the world.
so I'll gather everyone.
we'll be right there.
it is so nice to have you here, sir. - Great.
we didn't have that 10 years ago.
what do you mean?
communications coordinator. - Right.
Oh, lots has changed. Come meet the team.
S.S.A. Dvid Rossi, this is S.S.A. Emily Prentiss.
sir.
S.S.A. Derek Morgan.
it's an honor, Agent Rossi.
please, just Dave.
and Dr. Spencer Reid.
sir, if I could talk to you later about your work with the scarsdale skinner.
Psycho-linguistics is an incredibly dynamic field, and the fact that your profile of his reading habits ultimately led to his capture - is something I find so incredibly intrig... - Reid, slow down.
he'll be here for a while. You can catch up with him later.
sorry. - No problem, doctor.
maybe you guys can talk on the jet.
Oh, yeah, that'd be great. - The jet?
we have a jet now.
are you serious? - Yeah. It comes in pretty handy.
come on. J. J.'S waiting.
Carrollton, Texas, is a suburb just outside of dallas.
4 days ago, Michelle Colucci found this flier on her front door.
she found it?
meaning she wasn't actually missing?
yet. She took the flier to a friend's husband, detective Yarbrough, at the Carrollton P. D.
who told her it was probably just a Halloween prank, and he sent her home.
well, I don't blame him.
Halloween brings out the fool in everyone.
still, he stopped by Michelle's house later to check on her.
the door was open, and when he went inside, he found this.
he still thought maybe it could be some kind of a prank, until yesterday.
Michelle was found floating in a small creek just outside of Carrollton.
she had been sexually assaulted...
and her face had been removed.
removed? It wasn't animals or fish?
the dallas county M. E. Say that the edges of the wounds were smooth, not torn.
a very sharp instrument had been used.
he also found water in her lungs.
Oh, my god!
what is that?
technical analyst Penelope Garcia, this is ssa David Rossi.
is it gone, J.J?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're safe.
OK. Just to, um...
Carrollton, texas, has nearly 117, 000 residents, a diverse population with A... it's all in there.
I'm sorry.
very happy to meet you, sir.
I'll be in my office.
sorry.
she's different.
you have no idea.
uh, so, the unsub tells her she's going to go missing to psychologically torture her, then tortures her physically.
textbook sadist.
a sophisticated one.
that's elaborate.
number one.
that particular mask is known as a false face.
it's most commonly worn during halloween and Mardi Gras.
creepy. I rest my case.
false face.
her face-- he mocks it, then destroys it.
Oh, and, Hotch-- local media has the story. It broke big.
tell Carrollton we'll be there first thing in the morning.
let's stop this one at one. - Yes, sir.
if you want to take some time to get situated, maybe start on the next case?
I'm not back to get situated, Hotch, I'm here to work.
everybody get your things together. We're going to texas.
Abbey, what's the latest?
police sources tell me they have no leads in the case they are calling the "have you seen me"Murders.
where the hell do you get this stuff?
no, not you, agent Jareau. The television.
the press is saying we gave this thing a stupid name, like it's some kind of damn game or something.
just...
call me when you all get in tomorrow. I'll take you wherever you need to go.
all right. Good night.
Abbey, do we know when this flyer first surfaced?
we have heard reports that ms. Colucci received this flier late tuesday afternoon when she returned home from work.
never saw the point at throwing an egg at anything.
dallas, TEXAS
or even the connection to halloween, for that matter.
what the hell...
Oh, my god. That's me.
Oh, my god!
let's go over victimology.
would you like to join us, Dave?
Reid, what have you got?
uh, Michelle Colucci was single, lived alone, no boyfriend and no ex-husband.
dating?
there's nothing in the reports.
she was an architect.
friends and co-workers say she's a class workaholic.
basically a loner who rarely went out of the house.
so she's extremely low risk.
if it wasn't someone she knew personally, it's possible she was being stalked.
interesting. - What's that?
Oh, I'm just thinking out loud.
something to add? - No.
sorry to interrupt.
well, she's pretty.
it could be that the unsub met her casually and...
made her part of some kind of fantasy.
and he tries to act on it and she rejects him?
so he tortures her, out of anger?
masks often represent a state of mind.
this one's blank, expressionless. Doesn't really coincide with anger.
Reid, it's hard to imagine he did this out of anything less than rage.
Hey, guys.
what's up? You got something for us?
a list of Michelle Colucci's clients.
she designed office space. Mostly big corporate remodeling plans.
no private clients, one-on-one contact?
doesn't look like it, no.
Thanks, baby girl. - Yeah.
it's right this way, ma'am.
police Department CARROLLTON. TEXAS - Detective Yarbrough? - Fbi?
we got another flier-- this time metro dallas.
her roommate called dallas P. D.This morning.
Enid never game home after walking her dog last night.
so she is missing.
well, he wallpapered the neighborhood with fliers for 2 blocks around their apartment.
outside. That's different.
no one saw him putting them up?
dallas P. D.Is still canvassing, but nothing so far.
they're waiting for you on the new scene.
mind if I keep this? - Not at all.
Morgan, you and Prentiss go to Michelle Colucci's house.
J. J.And I will talk to Enid's roommate.
Dave, do you mind walking the disposal site with the detective and Reid?
whatever you need.
we'll regroup in an hour.
these houses sure are close together.
Yeah.
so how do I get a woman out of her house without anyone seeing me?
well, he must have been watching her for a long time and knew that it was safe.
there isn't a lot of cover on this street.
I have a vehicle.
big enough so I can watch without being seen.
but not so big as to draw attention to itself.
no.
neighbors will notice a strange vehicle parked in front of their house day after day, night after night.
it's human nature.
you would notice something out of place in your own neighborhood.
and you would definitely notice a man repeatedly standing on your street.
Yeah. It just doesn't make any sense.
he didn't watch from here.
as we reported earlier, Enid White is still considered missing...
big story.
leeches.
haven't had something this big to play in a long time.
did the press run with the story about the mask?
mask?
a mask was left at Michelle Colucci's apartment.
first time I'm hearing about it.
good.
let's make sure that stays ours. - Yeah.
miss white's roommate says that Enid walks her dog every night at the same time , takes the same route, right down this street.
nothing a stalker likes better than routine.
well, she definitely would have seen this if this was here before she went missing.
a couple of neighbors say they may have seen a guy putting up a flier during the day, bueaey rt thlly couldn't remember anything about him.
all right, well, we're gonna have to know everything we can about the victim.
I know you sent some stuff over to quantico, but it would help us if we could interview the roommate ourselves.
we have her downtown now.
Where's her dog? - Excuse me?
if she was abducted while she was walking her dog. Where's her dog?
we went over this area pretty thoroughly.
there's no evidence left.
I just want to stand where she was.
Dr. Reid, do we still keep all the old files in the fourth floor storeroom?
I think some are up there. You know, most of our information's on computer now.
right.
have you had a chance to go through our data since you've been back?
not yet.
you'll be amazed.
the original team
I mean, you interviewed something like, - uh, 45 serial killers, right? - Something like.
today we have interviews with over 1, 000 offenders.
serial killers, child abductors, sex offenders.
I'll go through it with you sometime if you like, answer any questions.
sounds good.
Michelle's body was found right here.
I really thought it was a prank.
you can't really blame yourself for that.
she made herself dinner.
excuse me?
she had time to make herself dinner.
I mean she was home for a while before he...
there was time to help her.
water.
obliterates a body...
destroys evidence.
but you weren't in the water that long, were you, Michelle?
she had rocks tied to her to weigh her down.
she floated to the surface before there was any other damage.
just what was done to her already.
the salient point is that it was the first thing the unsub wasn't good at.
green river dumped most of the bodies in the water.
but they weren't weighed down. - Yeah.
we know now it's 'cause he didn't care if they were found.
he had no connection to them.
this is where I'd wait.
Yeah.
I'd never be able to see you from the house.
he was here a lot.
watching everything she did.
we got anything?
agent Rossi pointed out that since the victims were weighted down, it suggests the unsub didn't want them found.
it suggests some sort of connection between them.
detective, how long was Michelle missing?
she was found on the fourth day.
so if she wasn't in the water long, then he held her for 3.
I've been running all of Enid White's credit cards.
And?
she made a purchase at 9 A. M.this morning at a sporting goods store in dallas.
this morning?
what did she buy?
a shotgun.
Thanks.
the man was seen posting fliers around the neighborhood where Enid White was known to walk her dog.
the police are still unable to give us any information at this time, and they are saying they still have no possible leads.
we will continue to keep you posted as we receive more details about the hunt for Enid White...
she can buy a gun that easily?
this is texas.
there's no license or waiting period for most rifles or shotguns.
is there video surveillance of guns sales in sporting goods stores?
there's supposed to be.
J. J.Call the store.
find out if it was Enid or the unsub using her credit card.
right away.
detective Yarbrough.
there's an urgent call from a woman on one.
detective Yarbrough.
my name is Enid White.
where are you, Enid?
the news reports said that the police didn't believe that other woman when she saw the missing fliers.
that was a mistake, Enid.
I have a gun.
I don't think I can stay awake very much longer.
Enid, this is agent Hotchner of the fbi.
we believe you, and we want to help you.
can you tell us where you are?
el royale motel in dallas.
it's room 6.
I saw the fliers.
hurry, please.
he's gonna kill me.
don't move, Enid. We're on our way.
clear.
she's gone.
20 minutes.
we were here in 20 minutes.
I can't believe we lost her.
we may not have lost her. He kept Michelle for 4 days.
but we got nothing.
that's not true. Look at the difference in the scenes.
what do you mean? There's the masks, the fliers.
Yeah, but these fliers weren't tacked up, they were just thrown around the room.
so?
he left in a hurry like he knew we were coming.
OK, this was under the bed.
972 area code.
that's Carrollton.
the hotline number.
she used a cell phone.
you can get a cell interceptor at any electronics store.
you can?
Yeah. They don't cost that much.
he probably sat right out here and heard everything she said.
but if he followed her here from dallas, why wait till she calls us to move on her?
to make sure it was the police who found the mask.
we need to gather your men and give a profile.
he's a white male.
his shoe prints have been examined and put him at about 5'11, 165.
so we've narrowed it down to anyone of average weight and height.
exactly.
speak and be recognized by your empress, mortal.
is this the technical analyst girl?
who's this?
Dr. Reid said this was your direct line from the team.
it is.
this is agent Dave Rossi. We met yesterday.
of course, of course. I'm sorry--sir.
uh, yeah, I already started processing the footprint information on Michelle Colucci
no, no, no. This is about something else.
all the past open cases the B. A.U. worked on are on computer now?
most of them.
there may be a few left to catalog.
if I give you a victim's name, could you find the old records?
Oh, records are my specialty, sir.
the original case-- I'm going back 20 years.
won't be a problem.
the name is Galen.
Diana and Richard Galen.
they had 3 children.
OK. I will get back to you super fast. Scout's honor.
no, no, um, just put a file together.
I'll get it when I get back.
it's really no problem, sir. I could just send it
not necessary. I'll look at it when I get back.
and let's keep this between us, if you don't mind. For now.
OK.
thank you.
my pleasure entirely, sir.
there's a sophistication and patience in what this unsub does that suggests a level of maturity.
we believe this puts his age in the mid-30s to 40s range.
Michelle Colucci was taken from the primary crime scene and disposed of at the tertiary crime scene 4 days later.
that means she was held somewhere for at least 3 days.
you can't really just hold a victim anywhere for days on end, so he most likely has access to a house of some kind.
and he's also fairly tech savvy.
the fliers were made on a computer.
and it's probable that he used a device to intercept Enid White's phone call.
witnesses in Enid White's neighborhood say they may have seen a white man putting up fliers, but none of them could describe him, even with all the media attention this case has received.
great.
actually, what that tells us is that there is absolutely nothing remarkable about this man.
he is exceedingly average.
as you said, detective Yarbrough, average height, average build.
it extends to his professional life as well.
he most likely works in a field where he doesn't stand out, doesn't really make a mark.
his lack of distinction is part of his psychopathy.
we have hundreds of interactions with people every day.
most of those involve someone overlooking someone else.
most of us don't pay any attention to being ignored, but to this kind of unsub, each oversight is intentional.
especially when it comes from his object of sexual desire.
he begins to obsess over her until she's all he can think about.
and the rage builds until he has to attack that person.
so he's pissed off that nobody notices him?
have you seen me?
wait. That's not about the women.
no. The masks are about the women
number one, number 2.
the fliers probably refer to him.
removing his victims' faces transfers his feelings of being ignored into a mission and it gives him a sense of power.
and the power can make him arrogant, but it doesn't make him notable.
so how the hell do we catch an invisible man?
I'm pretty sure we can get him to contact you.
what?
well, the crime scenes show he wants to deliver his message to the police.
he isn't going public.
hopefully, by playing on his anger...
J. J.How'd they get that?
not from me. I
Hotch, I called all the local police departments and I stressed withholding the mask.
I called them.
what?
I said the fbi thinks the masks mean he's impotent.
can I speak to you for a second?
why would you do that?
it'll make him contact us.
he's screaming for it.
we aren't prepared.
prepared?
we need to set up a trap and trace.
trap and trace?
they never stay on the phone long enough for that.
Dave, they're a lot faster than they used to be.
we also need to prep the detective on what to say to him.
he's not gonna want to talk to the detective.
he's gonna want to talk to the fbi.
we don't step over the local police like that.
they called us in.
Yes, but if the perception is that we're to embarrass the locals by telling the media that we're gonna fix things, then they'll stop calling us.
relax, Hotch. I've got this.
you see, that's the problem, Dave.
there is no I.
we function as a team.
I've been doing this before you were out of high school, probably before the rest of your team was in school at all.
I know that.
things have changed.
the bells and whistles changed.
an unsub is still an unsub, and I know how to deal with an unsub.
no, Dave, it's not just that. - Hotch.
what?
Garcia found something.
Garcia, talk to us.
so, Michelle Colucci recently drew up the plans for a remodel of 3 floors of a company called techco communications.
it's a high-tech communications company in downtown dallas.
and Enid White?
worked there until 2 months ago.
he's on 2.
the unsub?
demanded to speak to the fbi.
this is fbi supervisory special agent David Rossi.
you called me impotent.
did I?
I'm not impotent.
why are you whispering?
you lied.
you lied.
is someone around you?
are you at work?
you have to tell the news the truth.
I'll get you on the news, then you can correct me yourself.
no, you, you, you correct it.
by the way, I was, um, looking at the police security tapes for the day Michelle Colucci went missing.
what?
you watched her long enough to know she didn't have visitors.
she was a loner.
yet you knew that detective Yarbrough was coming over.
you must have been right here in this station when he told her.
now, your face is gonna be on one of those tapes, and when I find it,
I'm gonna paper this city with it, just like you did with those women.
everyone will see it.
they won't be able to ignore you now.
but you won't inspire fear, you'll inspire hatred and ridicule, because the only power someone like you has is a mask, and once that mask is removed, you'll be as insignificant as you've always been
a loser!
you just signed Enid White's death warrant.
lieutenant, I need you to lock the techco building down tight.
nobody in, nobody out. It's vital.
Rossi, you really think the unsub's still gonna be there after that call?
of course. He thinks he has all the time in the world.
you think they got an image off the police security camera yet?
the security camera doesn't work. I lied about that.
you lied about that?
he doesn't know.
Dave, that was incredibly reckless.
Hotch, he didn't weigh the body down well.
what do you mean?
he didn't want Michelle found so quickly.
he screwed that up.
this kind of guy, when he plans something, if he has the time, if he's in control, he's meticulous.
but being on the edge of the river, out in the open, he was not in control.
he was in a hurry, and he made a mistake.
that's what you're hoping.
trust me.
with an unsub like this, you need to throw him off his game.
his hand needs to be forced.
I know that, Dave, but the point is, you did it by forcing ours.
is the building sealed? - Top to bottom.
Yarbrough, make sure it stays that way.
Garcia, which floors did Michelle carlucci remodel?
got it--7, 8,9.
Morgan, take 7.
we're looking for a rank-and-file employee who made a scene in the last 20 minutes or was here and gone.
Prentiss, 8,Reid, 9.
don't approach him. Just...
try to get a name, maybe a picture.
he's somewhere in this lobby.
Why?
can't you feel it?
display your credentials. Fbi.
he thinks we know what he looks like.
got him.
sir?
sir!
we have your address, Max. There's no place to go.
this is agent Rossi, Max.
if you do what you're thinking, you won't get to tell them I lied.
come on, Max, slowly put your hands on top of your head.
listen to him, Max.
I know what you're thinking and you don't have to do it.
it doesn't have to end here, Max.
please.
down!
you ok? - Yeah.
he's gone. - What about Enid White?
we have his home address.
is she there?
let's hope so.
you said out there, the team shares everything.
that's right.
there is no I?
it seems a big thing to withhold.
separating from your wife, your child.
what are you talking about?
you used to call haley 10 times a day.
we've been together 48 hours, I haven't seen you call her once.
haven't mentioned her.
and you're not going home now.
what's your point?
I guess you're just not used to sharing.
my private life is not the same as a case.
I'm just saying, sharing is a learned skill.
you know...
when this all started...
there were only a few of us.
we'd go out on the road alone.
we didn't... groupthink.
we don't groupthink.
we think as individuals, and we share the thoughts with the rest of the team.
we don't write them down in a little notebook and keep them to ourselves.
all this-- the people we've helped, the ones we've put away, it's...
because of you and the guys who started this unit, who believed when nobody else did that there was a way of understanding these crimes and getting ahead of them.
And?
I don't see that you have anything to prove.
you don't have to come back.
I know that.
so why?
maybe I have unfinished business.
detective Fulwood.
you got a visitor.
I'm not here.
it's Sandra Lombardini.
the body we found in the woods -- it wasn't Brooke.
do you know who?
it was Lynette Hagen.
her parents just identified the remains.
we have people searching the area, but the rain's making it tough.
you should try to get some sleep, Sandra.
I can't.
not without knowing.
Ron, I need something from you.
anything.
the necklace -- Brooke's
the one you found on the ground by the car.
that's in evidence.
something like that may take some time.
please. I need it.
may I ask you why?
he says it could tell him things.
what is it?
what did you see?
current influences should turn this day into one with plenty of potential,
but avoid the trap of trying too hard.
know your strengths. Rely on them.
confidence, real or pretend, is your magic ingredient.
confidence. Yes, I like that.
come on, guys, you don't think there's actually anything to that stuff, do you?
you'd be surprised.
it's gibberish. - Thank you.
Oh, you are just jealous because you don't have the magic ingredient.
I have the magic ingredient. It's called splenda.
all right, skeptic, what's your sign?
no. - No -- is that in April?
Reid, we need a d. o.b. on Prentiss.
Ah, 7: 12 a. m.，October 12, 19... - Hey!
libra -- I should have known.
a romantic opportunity may experience a slight hitch thanks to the pesky lunar influence
which could have you dipping into a rather chilly mood.
if being demonstrative and warm is difficult,
then neutralize this temporary cold front with a simple but affectionate gesture.
I have a simple gesture.
Hey. You guys ready to gather?
well, look at you, Miss Thing. First day back and you're all business.
well, it's either dive right in or confront my separation anxiety.
it's tough being away from him, huh? - Yeah.
Oh, hey, that's new, isn't it?
Yeah, citrine. It's Henry's birthstone.
will and I both got one.
Oh, that's sweet.
you done with this?
all yours. - Thank you.
there's been a string of abductions in Olympia, Washington, going back 9 months.
4 women in all, blond, blue-eyed, early 20s.
this morning they found one.
when were they taken? - 9 months ago.
so she was the first? - Yeah.
looks almost mummified.
uh, not exactly.
frozen? - Embalmed.
that's different.
Yeah. So the time of death is a bit of a question mark right now.
where did they find her?
in a state park just east of Olympia. Seasonal hiking area.
the body was jarred loose during a mudslide.
that, plus the abnormal decomp makes it difficult to know how long she was there.
it says the victims were abducted about 3 months apart.
he's rotating his victims out.
there are gonna be more bodies out there.
I lay down by the side of my darling,
my darling, my life and my bride,
in the sepulcher there by the sea,
in her tomb by the sounding sea.
Edgar Allan Poe.
so if I wanted to embalm a body, well, what's the process?
start with some nose plugs.
the blood is drained through the jugular vein.
and replaced with embalming fluid through one of the two major arteries.
it usually takes a few hours.
then you'd need special equipment, training.
knowledge of the human vascular system would also be a plus.
a doctor, maybe.
a nurse, technician, somebody with a background in mortuary sciences.
now, there's a major they didn't offer at my school.
personally, the whole thing just seems weird to me.
embalming, I mean.
some people like to look good for their funeral.
but it's not them. It's just a shell, polished and painted.
I just want to be cremated.
the question is why somebody would embalm the body of someone they just murdered.
he wants to hold on to them. It's a possession issue.
this way they can never leave.
maybe fear of abandonment speaks to his history.
but eventually even an embalmed body will decay and he finds himself in need of new victims.
that explains the abduction cycle -- a new victim every 3 months.
which means at least 2 of the remaining women are already dead.
and the third? - Brooke Lombardini.
we know the odds.
90% of all abduction victims are killed within the first 36 hours.
hiker found a foot protruding from the soil right up here.
whole side of the hill slid down from up there.
so you're focusing the search in this area here.
Yeah, but if he dumped other bodies here, he's got over 800 acres to work with.
keep your men near the fire road, detective.
one man dragging a body through the woods...
110 pounds of dead weight, he's not gonna get far from the path.
that's why a lot of killers dismember their victims. They're easier to dispose of that way.
you think it says something about the profile, he didn't chop her up?
possibly, yeah.
what is it?
uh, detective.
we got -- we got something up here.
the answer to your question, detective, is yes, this killer can't dismember these women.
he cares for them.
Brooke worked the closing shift the night she disappeared.
she would have walked this way to her car.
upscale restaurant?
well, let's just say that I don't go unless it's on someone else's dime.
what are you thinking?
these women were taken as they left work.
high-end spa, nice restaurant, jewelry store.
if he patronizes these businesses, then he's got money.
it narrows the profile a little.
the cook said that he left just a few minutes after Brooke.
saw her car there, driver's side door open.
he was quick. Surprised her.
11 p. m. it was dark, he had cover. She probably never saw him coming.
it says in here they recovered her necklace, amethyst, broken chain?
right here, right next to the car.
did you process the necklace?
we couldn't get anything off of it.
just some hair in the clasp. Hers.
I'd like to take a look at it.
Yeah, well, I gave it back to her mother.
isn't it a little premature to be returning evidence to the family?
there were special circumstances.
she hired someone.
guy by the name of, uh, Stanley Usher.
he helped find a kid in Portland a couple years ago.
private investigator?
a psychic.
what does that have to do with the necklace?
apparently he can read personal things...
their aura. I don't know.
so what did he tell her?
I know Brooke is still alive.
it's not too late for you to do the right thing.
let her come home to me.
she turns 27 on Wednesday.
wish she would have waited until we had a chance to coach her.
I don't know, she seems to be doing a pretty good job.
good enough to make the unsub think twice about killing Brooke.
if he hasn't already.
chances are this is all too late.
it's her daughter. She has to have hope, right?
hope's one thing. False hope is something else.
I guess you've worked with psychics before?
Yeah. Not by choice.
you know, there are cases where people believe they've helped.
when people are vulnerable, they'll believe a lot of things.
we think the man who took her, uh, may have come by her work.
a customer, someone she may have talked about.
we think this man is a loner.
he would dine by himself, make frequent visits.
but he's shy, avoids eye contact.
she got asked out sometimes.
no, this man wouldn't have asked her out. He wouldn't have had the courage.
he would have stared at her, made her uncomfortable.
I've told the police everything I know.
you shouldn't be here. You should be looking into the clues.
right. Clues from Brooke's necklace.
Yes, sir. It's called token object reading, or psychometry.
Yeah. You're not my first.
a fenced-in area, the color orange, and the numbers 8, 6, 7.
does that help you?
so, Mr. Usher, by touching a personal item, you think that you can tell if someone's alive or dead.
sometimes.
see, a person's energy makes an impression on everything they touch.
it allows me to connect with them.
the hard part is interpreting what I'm given.
did you get anything else, uh, about her condition?
only that she...
felt weakened, tired.
I don't know, uh... Heavy.
heavy. Can I talk to you for a second?
excuse me.
I've been around a little, and I've seen guys like you come into the lives of grieving families.
sir, I assure you, that's not what... - Listen to me.
the last thing this woman needs is some con man giving her unrealistic ideas.
with all due respect, sir, you may not know what she needs.
your job is to know the perpetrators.
we're not talking about my job.
well, maybe we should be.
because there are a lot of people out there who don't believe in what you do, either.
annette Hagen, Erin Bonham, and Melissa St. Claire, all embalmed.
that's the first 3. That leaves the Lombardini girl still out there.
did you figure out cause of death?
blood loss.
blood loss?
they were alive when they were embalmed?
looks that way. Tox screens show significant levels of barbiturate.
they were sedated, maybe unconscious.
Reid, look at this. They all have the same haircut.
these are recent photos. These two had much longer hair at the time of their abduction.
so the unsub cut it.
something else he may have done.
their ears have all been double-pierced.
were they sexually assaulted?
not exactly.
there was no tearing or bruising that would normally suggest it.
but I did find trace amounts of semen.
you're saying it may have been consensual?
no.
she's saying they were dead.
I spoke to the families.
none of the victims had double-pierced ears at the time of their abduction.
cutting hair and piercing ears.
he's changing them.
into what, though? - Into who.
the burial suggests an affection for his victims.
which says he might be remaking them into the image of a loved one.
the M. E. found high levels of barbiturate?
Yeah. Why?
just, uh, something the psychic said -- that Brooke felt tired, heavy.
why are we talking about the psychic?
it's a scam. These guys talk without saying anything and you fall for it.
well, he said that Brooke's alive, so I guess I just want to believe him.
JJ, you know the profile.
a necrophiliac has no use for a live victim.
you ready to talk to them?
Garcia, I need you to run a full background check for me.
name's Usher, Stanley Usher.
by now we know the DNA found on the victims did not match anyone in the system,
so we're gonna have to look beyond physical evidence to identify the killer.
our unsub is a white male in his mid-to-late 20s, and he has money.
he lives alone, in a large residence.
there's enough space and ventilation to accommodate an embalming suite.
he's awkward with people, especially women.
an inability to relate socially is common in homicidal necrophiles.
because of the alterations to the bodies, we believe the unsub is attempting to recreate a woman he once loved.
like a girlfriend?
or a wife, a mother. Someone who left or died suddenly.
this projection of the loved one coupled with his need to preserve the victims through embalming is similar to the psychopathology of serial murderer Ed Gein.
Gein had an oedipal complex which developed in the years he nursed his paralyzed mother back from a stroke.
after she died, his obsession compelled him to dig up corpses of women who resembled his mother.
so persistent was his desire to resurrect his dead mother that he actually dressed in female suits fashioned from human skin.
eventually, Gein grew unhappy with the flesh of dead bodies,
which had a tendency to dry and crack,
so he shifted his focus to live victims whose bodies he could better preserve.
the evolution from dead to live victims will also be mirrored in our unsub's maturation.
we've put together a list of incident reports prior to 2006.
you're gonna want to follow up on these.
now, they are inappropriate postmortem conduct, cadaver theft, and graveyard disturbances.
60% of necrophiles work in the death business,
so be sure to canvass local cemeteries, mortuaries, and morgues.
and since we have the killer's DNA, we're gonna be sending you out with kits to swab potential suspects.
the odds of finding Brooke Lombardini alive are slim,
but the quicker we identify the killer, the better her chances are.
for her sake, let's work fast.
that lawsuit is a joke.
it's my job to prep the deceased. Is simply adjusting her clothing.
by adjusting you mean undressing?
look, man, I'm not here to judge you.
I'm looking for a killer.
so if you want to prove your innocence, all you gotta do is say "ahh."
we're looking for instances where graves have been disturbed -- desecrations, exhumations. Female bodies.
attractive ones.
nobody's attractive once they've been in the ground.
they would have been recent burials.
no, haven't had anything like that.
an older grave got ransacked a couple years ago.
was the body taken?
no. The body was just a pile of bones.
they stripped it clean, though.
made off with the jewelry, dress.
I won't lie. It -- it happens in the industry.
and we put a stop to it when it does.
you don't report it to the police?
well, we... like to keep that kind of thing quiet.
a killer is dressing up his dead victims and violating them.
maybe quiet isn't the best way to go.
he dresses them up?
that mean something to you?
we hired an apprentice a while back.
odd guy. Even for this business.
I didn't like the attention he paid the female cadavers.
I come to find out he liked to do their makeup.
put a wig on them and such.
can you describe the wig for me?
we cleaned out his locker after his termination.
there she is.
he never came back for it. Imagine that.
I need this man's name.
Ivan Bakunas?
Yeah. Can I -- can I help you?
you could invite us inside. It's a little wet out here.
Oh, I -- I can't. Mother's sleeping.
we're investigating a series of murders in the area.
we believe the killer works in your field.
Wow. Jeez. You're kidding. Do I know him?
you might. His victims are just your type. Blond hair, blue skin.
you're suggesting I'm some kind of murderer?
then you are way out of line.
so you wouldn't object to giving us a sample of your DNA.
I don't know. No.
we can get a warrant.
I think I've said all I'm gonna say.
did you find anything on Ivan Bakunas?
nothing in juvey.
but he was expelled from evergreen state for assaulting his girlfriend.
sexual?
he was slipping her tranquilizers and having sex with her while she slept.
that qualifies.
Oh, wait! Emily, maybe this is that romantic encounter your horoscope foretold.
Bye, Garcia.
between that and the wig, we should be able to persuade a judge.
detective, I'm not gonna stand in your way if you want to serve a warrant on Bakunas,
but I think you're wasting your time.
you're kidding, right?
we profiled a man of means.
according to his tax records, Bakunas hasn't held down a job since he graduated college.
he lives with his mother. Doesn't have a car.
the embalming equipment, the drugs -- that stuff's not cheap.
look, this guy likes to get it on with dead people.
if that's not probable cause, I don't know what is.
Hotch, a 911 operator just got a distress call from someone claiming to be Brooke Lombardini.
Hello?
can you speak up, ma'am?
no. He'll hear me.
this is Brooke Lombardini. Please, I need help.
where are you calling from, ma'am?
I'm being held prisoner.
OK, ma'am. Can you look outside?
can you see a street name or an address?
please... I think he's...
ma'am? - Gonna kill me.
please help me.
that's her, that's Brooke?
any surveillance expert will tell you it's almost impossible to positively identify a whisper.
you think I don't know my own daughter's voice?
why would someone who was not Brooke call 911 and say they were?
sometimes people get off injecting themselves into the story.
you've been on tv now and that could bring out a lot of sick individuals.
stanley said she was alive. This proves it.
stanley Usher has a vested interest in telling you that your daughter is alive.
and do you have a vested interest in telling me that she's not?
he has a record, ma'am.
I had a colleague look into it.
usher was charged with fraud in Oregon before he pulled up stakes and moved here.
I need my baby to be alive.
all she has right now is hope.
why would you take that from her?
you know, most people think that a person's hair and nails continue to grow after they're dead.
that's a myth.
Abby... Abby... Abby, hold still.
I know how much you like a straight line.
who's Abby?
you are, silly.
911 call came from a disposable cell.
no I. D.， but they traced it to the nearest tower.
and that narrows it down to a 20-mile radius here just southeast of Seattle.
that's a densely populated area. Were they able to triangulate?
Garcia tried to ping the phone, but it was already dead.
the unsub probably turned it off when he found her with it.
you mean if he found her.
Dave, I agree with you about psychics,
but the fact is Sandra Lombardini positively identified her daughter's voice.
we have to assume that that call was genuine.
so what do we think?
why is the unsub keeping Brooke alive?
and how long do we think she has until he kills her?
maybe he needs them alive to effect their transformation.
the change in the hair, the makeup, piercing the ears -- that would only take a few hours.
he's had her for almost 5 days.
OK, so maybe it's about something more than just appearance.
maybe it's something deeper.
on the phone she made it sound like she was being locked up, and she sounded drugged.
these are control mechanisms used in cases of sexual slavery, mind control.
it's brainwashing. - So he's trying to break her down, make her surrender her identity.
that's what he's waiting for.
that's the version of them he wants to hold onto.
the longer she holds out, the longer she stays alive.
and as soon as she accepts her new role, her fate is sealed.
tell me a story, Abby.
you know I can't sleep without a story.
please...
let me out.
story first, Abby.
I told you, I'm not Abby.
what did you do to me?
tell me a story, Abby.
I told you, I'm not Abby!
OK. Thank you.
that was the lab with the DNA results on those swabs.
no matches? - No. Our guy's still out there.
what's he doing here?
detective, a word.
do you know what you're doing?
can't afford to let my ego get in the way on this one.
take all the help I can get.
look, I'm happy to be wrong about Brooke.
hell, I'm praying I am.
but I'm not wrong about this guy.
Mr. Usher, good to see you again.
and you.
can I help you with something?
I'm spoken for.
this way. - Ma'am.
Congratulations.
tell me a story, Abby.
tell me a story so I can sleep.
once upon a time there was once a lad who went to look for a place...
and he went along, he met a man who asked him where he was going.
he told him his errand and the stranger said that he
you're not doing it right!
you're supposed to do the voices.
OK, just tell me what you want and I'll do it!
I want Abby!
I'll be Abby! I'll be whoever you want!
No! No! No!
so you went ahead and arrested him.
he was trying to cross the border into Vancouver.
are you gonna charge him?
will if he confesses.
failing that, we'll hold him so he can't skip town while we're waiting for his DNA results.
I'll let the lab know a priority sample's coming.
Thanks.
well, what did he get off of the wig, detective?
enough to know that that's one sick puppy in there.
why don't you tell me about that.
looks like a wig. - That is a magic wig.
it changes the identity of the dead.
what?
well, I thought that's why you were putting it on the bodies at the morgue.
it makes the fantasy more real.
who were you trying to turn them into?
I have worked some sick cases
rapists, pederasts
I hope you're not grouping me with those people.
you may be the sickest of them all.
well, sick or no, many would argue it's a victimless crime.
what's victimless about Lynette Hagen?
who?
or Melissa St. Claire.
I don't know these women, ok? You have the wrong...
the wrong necrophile?
what, you think I'm the only guy in town who likes to crack open a cold one?
where is Brooke Lombardini?
I don't know who that is.
I don't kill people.
these, uh, profilers say our killer is trying to turn these girls into a loved one.
like a wife or a mom.
is your, uh, mother a blonde, Ivan?
that's disgusting.
the wig isn't even the important part.
for me it's -- it's the shoes.
so you put shoes on them, too.
they're a very special pair.
what's special about them?
the woman walked in them.
the weather girl?
she was a local celebrity killed in a car accident a couple of years ago.
a friend of mine was working when she came in on a slab.
he knew I was a fan.
Oh, so... He stole her shoes for you.
the wig, it just completed the look, but the shoes...
genuine article.
that's what makes it real.
genuine article.
Reid. - I took a report of a grave robbery.
I thought you said it was just a simple theft.
Yeah, but listen to what was taken.
a dress, a pair of diamond earrings, and a pair of pearl earrings.
2 pair.
if our unsub is like Bakunas, then he needs the genuine articles from the true object of his affection to complete the fantasy.
exactly. This grave could belong to that woman.
let's see. Abigail Hansen.
OK, so I got her obit from the Olympian.
Abigail Reina Hansen died suddenly at 26 from myocarditis, a heart defect.
sending her passport photo now.
well, she certainly looks the part.
Garcia, what else can you tell us about her?
I can tell you that she was born in Amsterdam, she never married,
and her employment records show her working for Patrick and Leona Gless from 1985 to her death in 1992.
can you get us an address for the Gless family?
they might be the only ones who can tell us who Abigail was.
Yeah.
this is the most beautiful place I could ever hope to live, said the Troll's daughter.
the youth and his sweetheart entered the castle, which was now theirs, and held their wedding.
now all the kings roundabout who had been in the Troll's debt.
and were now out of it came to the wedding and saluted the youth as their emperor.
long live the king!
and he ruled over them all and kept peace in the kingdom - Abby.
and lived in his castle with his beautiful empress happily ever after.
the end.
and as soon as she accepts her new role, her fate is sealed.
did Garcia say what Mr. Gless does for a living?
failed artist.
guess that's what they call failing up or marrying well.
I think about Abigail from time time.
she was such a nice girl.
she was like one of the family.
was that why you paid for the funeral?
she didn't have anyone else.
she was from Denmark.
Holland, dear.
what kind of work did she do for you?
she was the au pair.
and there was some cooking and cleaning.
she took care of the children?
just the one -- our son Roderick.
here.
this is the two of them together.
they were close.
she basically raised the boy.
well, I wouldn't go quite that far.
no? What would you call it?
Patrick likes to think he was a good father.
so...
why do you want to know about Abigail?
we believe that there may be a connection to some recent murders.
someone she knew.
how old was your son when Abigail died?
9.0
we weren't here when it happened.
we were on a cruise.
but Roderick was here with Abigail?
when we returned, we knew something was wrong.
the smell.
they were in his room on the floor.
he was...
curled up next to her, with her arms around him.
it's how he got to sleep.
how long had she been dead?
the coroner said 2, maybe 3 days.
I didn't have the stomach for the details.
we'd like to speak to Roderick.
well, if I knew where he was I'd be happy to tell you.
but we haven't spoken for years.
when he turned 21, he dropped out of medical school, liquidated his trust fund.
we knew he was troubled.
but I had no idea he would ever hurt someone.
they don't know for sure that he's...
you - you don't know for sure.
when was your last communication?
we got a letter about a year ago.
can we borrow this?
you can have it.
and while you're at it, take this, too.
it's exactly how they said. Roderick's trust was emptied in March of "04. Half a million bucks.
where is he now?
sir, the thing is, he's gotta be using straight cash, cause there's no paper trail on him for the last 4 years.
nothing from the I. R.S. from the DMV.
there's no property or utilities in his name.
you can't find him?
I'm sorry.
you know, a half a million isn't what it used to be.
and the way this unsub is accustomed to living,
after 4 years he would need to supplement his income.
anything between the lines, Reid?
nothing that points to a specific location.
he's basically saying he's happy.
that should be enough for her. It's essentially a goodbye letter.
enough for her?
it's only addressed to Leona.
why not his dad?
maybe they didn't get along.
no, that's not right.
Garcia, I need you to check something else.
so basically we got nothing.
I missed you.
me, too.
drink.
it's the last time.
promise?
promise.
the whole thing.
it's a surprise.
what is this place?
it's forever.
water. - That's what he said. Roderick is near water.
it's not very specific. The earth is two-thirds water.
he specified a rocky shoreline you could see.
JJ, this man is not exactly a reliable source of information.
OK. This photo from the Gless house.
it was taken at their house on Mercer Island.
waterfront property.
no one's lived there for 10 years. It's abandoned. I checked.
this could be where he's holding Brooke.
he's sending him money. - What's that?
Roderick's dad.
it's the reason Roderick never said goodbye to him in the letter.
they never lost contact.
that supplemental income you were asking about?
this is it. Every 6 months, a $50, 000 wire.
I'm telling you, he's sending it to Roderick.
if you'd seen his father, you'd know.
it's true. Deep down, he was very guilty about neglecting him.
he's submissive in the marriage. He's probably hiding it behind her back.
you don't think his dad knew?
no. No, I think he's a sad man trying to buy his kid's love.
this is where Brooke's 911 call originated.
this Western Union is within the circle.
Mercer Island isn't.
we've got a location.
is she alive?
paramedics!
he uses a barbiturate.
start 2 large-bore, i. v.s., narcan, 2 milligrams.
some psychic this guy is.
this place is as far from a rocky shoreline as you can get.
for those who believe, no proof is necessary.
for those who don't believe, no proof is possible, Stuart Chase.
watch your step there.
easy, now. - Honey.
she's gonna be ok.
you're in early.
couldn't sleep.
I know how it can be coming back here.
the bad things seem worse. You want easy answers.
if you're gonna tell me not to believe in psychics, you don't have to.
you can believe in what you want.
but when you're here, you need to have faith in what we do.
it works.
I just... I saw a mother losing her child, and, uh...
we didn't have any other leads. I thought, what harm could it do?
I asked the same question once.
you did?
it was a kidnapping case in Georgia.
we had nothing, time was running out, and there was a local woman known for her...
abilities.
on her advice, we took the investigation in the wrong direction.
the boy died.
I'm sorry.
it was a long time ago.
well, we won this time.
that's what matters, right?
welcome back.
Dahmer, Lake and NG, Debardeleben, Bardella, and others.
at the core of these criminals is a need for control.
killing was an act that provided a release "so sexually satisfying "that they were compelled to repeat the fantasy "with multiple victims again and again."
it is this continuum of violence that we will explore in deviance:
the secret desires of sadistic seal killers.
signed copies of agent David Rossi's 10th anniversary edition of his bestseller are on sale tonight.
I find your career so fascinating.
what's it like to interview serial killers?
well, it's never boring.
is that what you enjoy most about your work, looking evil right in the eye?
no, it's putting killers in jail.
you know what gets me are the wives who swear they had nclue their husband was a serial killer.
how can you be married to one and not know?
Theresa, would you mind calling up my car service?
not at all.
uh, you'll excuse me? - Sure.
agent Rossi.
I'm a big fan.
there's not gonna be a quiz. I saw you taking notes.
Oh, no, it's just for my own edification.
agent Rossi, are you or anyone in your department investigating the recent spike in homicides in Cleveland?
not that I'm aware of.
there's been an uptick in homicides by 11% this quarter.
the average uptick hasn't surpassed 5% in the past 10 years in Cleveland.
I'm guessing you're studying criminology.
I am.
sir, I think there's a serial killer here.
well, have the police issued a statement to corroborate that?
I filed an inquiry downtown.
um, nobody's called me back.
but, uh, I know that the coroner's office hasn't been as busy since,
like, the Butcher of Kingsbury Run in the 1930s.
well, what kind of homicides are we talking about here?
OK, um...
a man was shot in a park, a prostitute was found with her throat slashed,
a couple was found shot in their car, a woman was killed in a burglary.
do you know what 3 things profilers look at to link serial crimes?
victimology, modus operandi, and signature. - Good.
so were the victims similar? - No.
was the m.o.consistent? - no was the signature consistent?
not that I know of.
then there's no obvious reason to suggest that the spike in violence was due to a serial killer.
I see your point, sir, but I really
you're bright.
you obviously have a passion for this, and the bureau is always looking for good people.
so if you get a reply from the police, or even for career advice, I'm available.
OK, thanks. It was an honor to meet you.
keep studying, and don't stop until you find all the answers you're looking for.
I won't.
excuse me.
get back! Get back!
it's ok. Look, I'm not gonna hurt you, ok?
I live in the neighborhood.
what's your address?
817 tivoli. It's right down that way.
look, if I was gonna hurt you, I wouldn't have said "excuse me." Ok?
are we cool?
what the hell, man? You scared me.
I'm--I'm sorry.
what are you doing here?
I was just walking home from the liquor store and I saw you snooping around.
what about you?
so you heard what happened here?
Yeah. Poor woman.
all the neighbors are freaking out.
I can't believe I didn't even know her name.
she was raped, too.
can't believe this happened on my street.
no, it's not just your street.
there's been a lot of murders lately.
Really?
Yeah, it's uncharacteristically high for our city.
you with the police or something?
I'm just investigating a few cases.
gosh, all of a sudden, all these random, violent murders something weird is going on here.
what do you mean by weird?
agent Rossi.
Yes.
I'll be right down.
agent Rossi?
I'm detective Dan Brady.
we found your card on the victim.
any idea what happened here?
Albert Einstein.
she was found by a woman walking her dog this morning.
dog wouldn't stop barking.
I just talked to her last night.
I never asked her name.
that's her car right there.
these keys were still in her pocket.
car alarm was still activated. There was no sign of a break-in.
she had pepper spray but didn't use it?
I don't know, maybe she didn't get the chance.
nobody saw or heard anything? - No.
we went door to door. There were no witnesses.
there was blunt-force trauma to her head, signs of strangulation.
murderer asphyxiated her with the scarf she was wearing. Do you have any idea? What she was doing snooping around this case?
you keep talking like I know something. What case?
the resident of this house, Kayla James, was murdered and raped 3 days ago in a burglary-homicide.
I think there's a serial killer here.
and don't stop until you find all the answers you're looking for.
I won't.
this is Henry wearing the booties my mom knitted him.
I can't get over his cuteness.
Oh, and this is him wearing the customized leather jacket auntie Penelope got him.
when he grows up, he's gonna be a rebel.
is this David Rossi, the famous bestselling author David Rossi?
what are you doing? You're not supposed to be calling
I think my a. l. just ended.
what do you mean?
Garcia, Cleveland police is sending you some files.
get JJ to distribute them to the team right away. - Yeah.
what are we looking at?
I don't know yet.
just see if the team can find a connection with these crimes.
I'll call you back in a few hours.
Yes, sir.
she had a notebook with her last night.
I saw one in her car.
can I take a look?
it may be evidence, but I don't see why not.
have you been to her house yet?
I'm headed there now.
I have to notify the next of kin.
now, if you get a reply from the police, or even for career advice, I'm available.
Thanks. It was an honor to meet you.
Sheila Hawkes? - Yeah.
I'm, uh, detective Brady with the Cleveland police department. This is agent Rossi with the FBI.
may we come in? - Why ?
it's about your daughter.
That--that's--that's one of her journals. Has something happened?
Yes. She was murdered.
I am so sorry. Mrs. Hawkes.
Oh, no! No, where did you find her?
she was in a house in east Cleveland.
we think she may have been visiting a crime scene.
God...
I told her to stop doing that.
I told her that was too dangerous.
Where--where is she now?
she's at the coroner's office, and I can take you to see her when you're ready.
now. - Ok.
right now. I have to go right now.
Mrs. Hawkes, would you mind if I stayed behind to look in her room?
she was so excited to meet you. You're like a...
a hero to her.
Mrs. Hawkes. Let me take you downtown now.
come on.
I'll, uh, I'll send a car for you.
the crimes are within a 7-mile radius.
well, that's something.
Yeah, but the neighborhoods are all completely different.
they range from poor to rich, industrial to residential.
the physical locations are dissimilar, but the operating zone's well-defined.
OK. I'm in.
I see you.
in your web browser for search history.
check out her home page.
all right, so the first thing she looks at probably to stay current on her studies.
can you see what she worked on last?
voila. These are the most recently opened documents she created.
looks like she was compiling empirical data about homicide trends in Cleveland.
do you think she knew the killer?
I don't see any notes indicating suspects.
well, Dave, she's a criminology student.
she's been taught to analyze statistics and apply theory, not investigate killers.
let's talk about what we know.
all right. Victim one-- Travis Bartlett was last seen at a gay bar.
he was shot at night in a park.
victim 2, Lily Nicks, a 34-year-old prostitute, her throat was slashed.
victims 3 and 4, June Appleby and Troy Wertsler,
were shot in their car at a parking lot outside of a movie theater.
and victim 5 was a 28-year-old single woman, Kayla James, killed in her home.
she was bound, suffocated with a bag over her head, evidence of rape.
and then the sixth victim was Zoe.
victimology, weapons used, and c. o.d. are all different.
it's hard to imagine it's even the same unsub.
it can't be a coincidence that Zoe goes to Kayla James' house and gets murdered.
all right, let's say it is the same killer.
does anybody see a pattern?
well, maybe.
OK, the first crime, he shoots the victim.
the second crime, he rapes a woman and slashes her throat.
that's more personal.
and the third crime, he escalates to killing two people,
and the fourth, he escalates even more by raping a woman, binding her, and suffocating her.
so if it is the same unsub, you could argue that there's a progression of violence with every kill.
it could be an anger excitation offender getting more daring with each crime.
I think I got something here. Look the slashes in the prostitute's throat
they're all shallow, unsure cuts.
the kayla James crime scene-- telephone cord, rope, and duct tape were used.
it like he couldn't decide how to bind her.
so without a gun, he's sloppy, inexperienced.
the young couple shot in the car...
that crime scene remind you of anything?
Yeah, they were shot with a . 44 bulldog, just like the Son of Sam used on his victims, which were also young couples in parked cars.
it might be nothing, but you're right, there is a parallel there.
with the second victim, it's hard not to think of Jack the Ripper.
the obvious similarity being it's a prostitute whose throat was slashed.
Kayla James was bound, tortured, raped, with a plastic bag over her head like BTK.
what about victim number one?
Garcia, what neighborhood was he found in?
at a park in the Kingsbury Run area.
Zoe reminded me last night that Cleveland's most famous serial killer was the Butcher of Kingsbury Run.
he found his victims in gay bars, shot them, and dumped their body there.
Travis Bartlett was last seen at a gay bar, and his body was found in kingsbury park.
so these are copycats of famous serial killers?
he's a serial killer studying serial killers.
see you in Cleveland, Dave.
america's WORST SPREE KILLERS - Guys. - Hey, Dave.
we're in that room. Coffee's brewing.
we'll get started on the evidence boards.
detective Brady's our point.
I'll let you all introduce yourselves.
JJ. Can you help me out with something?
sure.
this has to be confidential.
I know it may seem farfetched, but copycat killers are not entirely uncommon.
this one happens to be copying several different killers.
but if he's trying to be the Butcher of Kingsbury Run, why didn't he cut up and mutilate the victims like the real guy?
that was 7 weeks ago.
he was just getting started.
beginning killers are often frightened of the crime itself.
they're more interested in getting it over with as quickly as possible and fleeing the scene.
he was just using the Butcher's ruse as a way to lure the victim to be alone with him.
and by the time he killed Kayla James 3 days ago, he'd progressed.
he came very close to copying all of the BTK's m. o.
he's reading, learning, borrowing from others because he doesn't know who he is yet.
and because of this, we think he's young and impressionable, maybe even a student.
someone probably enrolled in criminology classes.
our technical analyst is going through names of local students right now.
up to this point, changing his m. o. has prevented investigators from linking the crimes.
that's why we need to work quickly.
you're sure about this?
it's not a coincidence that all of these random,
violent murders in a localized area are copycats of serial killers.
it's as if all the worst serial killers have converged on Cleveland.
every time he plans to kill the murder weapon, the m. o. and the victimology will all change.
detective, will you let your team know we're ready to give a preliminary profile.
sure. I gotta go.
Hotch. I'm gonna step out for this one, clear my head.
OK.
Garcia found 3 male students enrolled in criminology classes with felony records.
good. We'll interview them.
I don't think we need to.
one of them is studying abroad, the other 2 are back in jail on other charges.
tell garcia to check enrollment in online and correspondence courses,
see if we have any luck with those parameters you guys handle the profile?
everything ok? - Everything's fine.
we have 6 homicides in a 7-mile radius in east Cleveland.
now, this small zone indicates that's he's a geographically stable offender.
this type of offender is characterized as young, socially immature,
of average intelligence, with psychopathic personality traits.
they also usually live alone and have an antisocial nature.
a serial killer's first murder is very telling.
this unsub's first murder, he chose the m. o. of Cleveland's own Butcher of Kingsbury Run.
the Butcher isn't as well known as other famous serial killers, but he is a local legend.
and because he picked the butcher to be first,
we believe he's a native of Cleveland and probably grew up hearing stories of the Butcher.
this is someone who is obsessed with serial killers.
his computer will be filled with research on them.
he'll have abundant images of murderers on his computer and possibly even snuff films.
he uses these like pornography.
these provide some sort of sexual release.
I think he went back to relive his crime.
when Zoe showed up, she became a victim of opportunity.
it's the same theory we arrived at on the plane.
he strangled her with her own scarf.
he didn't plan it. I think she surprised him.
I told her not to stop until she found the answers she was looking for.
I didn't think she would go to a crime scene.
her mom said it's something that she does all the time.
she probably would have gone anyway.
but it's because of what I said that she was encouraged to go there last night.
Dave, what are you doing?
she came to me and I dismissed her.
try not to personalize it.
I was the last one she talked to before she was murdered.
how is this not personal, Aaron?
OK. It's personal.
that doesn't change how we go about finding her killer.
we know that violent criminals develop a signature over a series of crimes
if he's young, he probably hasn't even figured out what his is yet.
find the signature, we can link the crimes.
he probably monitoring the news, seeing if the police have connected them yet.
we can use that. We can utilize the media.
and I think I know who we can talk to.
I knew homicides were up, but nobody said anything about a serial killer.
why do I get a visit from the BAU?
you're Paula Mcconnell, Cleveland's number one source in crime news.
you're detailed, you have a following. He's reading you.
we need you to write that the police have found his signature.
you can help us by explaining what his signature is in your article.
it's a killer's personal stamp, his distinctive touch that he leaves at the scene of every crime.
well, I've been doing this for 18 years.
and I know what a signature is, honey.
we just really need you to be detailed about this.
we're speaking directly to him.
through my column.
he's doing something, a behavioral impulse he feels compelled to do.
but a need-driven act to get a sexual release that's specific to his psyche.
this repetitive behavior at each crime scene will lead us to him.
let me take a stab at it.
Yeah, Reid.
uh, they just found another body.
they're bringing him up right now.
teenagers found him a little over an hour ago.
it's petechiae in the whites of his eyes.
judging from the bruising, he was probably strangled with a wire.
is this our guy?
it's gotta be. A jogger doesn't get garroted every day.
whatever signature he left was probably washed away in the water.
well, who's he mimicking now?
bike Path Rapist Altemio Sanchez comes to mind.
he trolled bike paths near Buffalo garroting his victims.
it looks like he copied everything except for the rape.
strangulation's a repetition of his last murder of Zoe.
first time he's repeated himself.
Zoe's murder was spontaneous, though. He didn't plan it.
he acted on instinct and did what came naturally to him.
maybe what came naturally felt good him and he wanted to feel it again
if he's starting to repeat a pattern, he may have found himself.
very good.
I'm Danny.
I want you to call us if you have any questions at all.
we're gonna take great care of her ok?
you're all set.
um, do I pay the bill here?
no, ma'am. The bill's been taken care of by an anonymous donor.
see anything else in there?
just the notations of an observant student.
I've been thinking, though.
Zoe got all of her information from the newspapers and from Paula Mcconnell's column.
there's no way she could have known about every homicide in the city.
well, not every homicide's reported in the papers.
so how do we know the unsub didn't commit more murders than the ones noted in her journals?
we don't.
we can check missing persons and see if anyone was last seen in the unsub's operating zone.
what?
well, a young person's mind is so active-- yours, zoe's, and I imagine this unsub's, too.
I think when he get him, he'll be curious.
he'll ask questions.
Rossi, heads up. She knows.
did you do this?
I don't need or want your money.
I have taken care of my daughter for 22 years, and she is still my responsibility.
I don't need any help from you.
you didn't even know her.
I'm sorry if I've offended you.
just leave us alone.
all right.
we found another body. East cleveland.
strangulation marks.
this was recent.
the bruises on her neck are still reddish.
no other obvious signs of trauma.
well, this isn't a bike path like the last one.
which serial killer is he mimicking now?
I don't think he is mimicking anymore.
he's starting to show consistency.
I think he's developing his own style.
has anybody touched her?
no. They have instructions to wait for us and the m. e.
Where's he? - Dr. Edwards!
here he comes.
agent Hotchner.
um, could you take a look at this spot on her forehead?
that's strange.
let me swab it and get it back to the lab. - Thx. 3 murders in the last 3 days. Something's causing his frenzy.
could be a drastic change in his life.
something he lost control of.
or it could be something he gained control of. Like himself.
if he finally defined himself as a strangler, he may just be practicing, perfecting his style.
he may have awakened.
the coroner just called.
preliminary tests confirm acetyl alcohol on the homeless woman's forehead.
he sterilized it?
why would he do that?
maybe he did something to her forehead, used an alcohol wipe to remove evidence.
well, if that's the case, it certainly wasn't necessary to the crime.
this could be part of his signature.
we should look at other victims to see if he did something similar.
any evidence on the last victim was washed away in the water.
and all the other bodies were either buried or cremated.
except for one.
I know you don't want to see me, but please hear me out.
we need Zoe's body to go back to the coroner's office.
Zoe's murderer left a clue on her body.
there's a chance we can find him from this clue, but we have to examine her again.
all I want to do is put her to rest.
Zoe chose to study criminology because she believed in bringing criminals to justice.
can't guarantee the evidence hasn't been compromised.
the mortician hadn't touched her yet.
even so, she's been transported more times than I'd like.
don't want anyone to get their hopes up.
just make sure the evidence gets to Quantico quickly.
january 22--prostitute murder, downtown at 5th and main.
january 9--man shot at kingsbury park.
february 15--kayla James. Lived alone. First home invasion...
february 8--murder... Young couple shot in park.
no apparent motive. Investigate.
why are locations different?
page 47, Rossi's book: there are no coincidences.
Garcia, you got something?
Yeah, the boys in the lab found trace amounts of saliva on Zoe's forehead, enough for a DNA sample.
so we got a codis match on Eric Ryan Olson, 23, Cleveland native,
did 2 1/2 years for attempted sexual assault and was paroled 6 months ago.
we thought for sure he'd be a student.
uh, that's cause he was.
while he was in the slammer, he took independent correspondence classes in forensic science
and criminology from an out-of-state school.
call the team. Let's get a search warrant. - Yeah.
clear! Clear!
Reid, check the computer.
detective, we should talk to the neighbors, find out where he goes. - Where he might be on a week night. - Aaron.
he's reading my books.
Reid, anything?
Al's alehouse. That's like 5 miles away.
it's on the schedule for tonight.
have a good night. - See you tomorrow.
he was alone at the bar. - When did he leave?
like 10 minutes ago. - Did he talk to anyone?
Linda, he left right after she did.
Thanks.
got it, hotch.
manager says he may have followed one of the waitresses out of the bar.
she walks home through cedar park.
we just passed cedar park. FBI! Get off the girl! Get off the girl!
OK, it's ok. - Stay down! Stay down!
get off me. -it's all right. Wait, wait, wait.
stop! We're trying to help you.
didn't see that coming.
how could she not know?
kenneth Bianchi's girlfriend had no idea he was one of the Hillside Stranglers.
just like BTK's wife.
what do we know about her?
her name's Linda Jones.
no criminal record. They met online 6 weeks ago.
no, he can't be this guy.
we found his DNA on a murder victim.
what?
we also think he's responsible for the murder of 7 other people over the last 7 weeks.
two of his victims were raped.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
OK, ok.
against my counsel, my client would like to talk to agent Rossi.
we talked about him being curious, asking questions.
if he thinks he knows you, he might open up.
I'll keep him talking. - Good.
agent Rossi. Big fan.
we have some information that would be of great interest to you.
my ears are burning.
my lawyer here explains that I'm being charged with 8 murders
and that I'm probably looking at the death penalty.
I have one very important question for you.
are you sure it's just 8?
what?
we checked missing persons.
since he started killing, 4 people have been reported missing in east Cleveland neighborhoods.
we can't rule out any of them as his possible victims.
he marked pages on several serial killers.
we don't know which one he tried to copycat.
we're screwed, then.
the D. A. is gonna have to offer him a deal.
the D. A. doesn't have to give him the option.
that's easy for you to say. You get to go home tomorrow.
what do I tell the families of the missing? Sorry, no idea?
detective, we're not gonna leave until we can give you and the families some closure.
and how are you gonna do that?
I need something, anything that might show where he was trolling for more victims.
once the D. A.gets here, we have a lot to talk about.
what do you think you're gonna get out of this?
I don't know. We'll see.
you don't have to say anything else, Eric.
you got to speak to him.
now let's just wait for the D. A.
I don't know how to break it to you, kid, but you don't have a card to play here.
we're 3 steps ahead of you.
really.
we've already considered the possibility that you killed other people.
we knew you were young, wanted to experiment.
it was likely you would copycat as many serial killers as possible to figure out who you are and what you liked.
so let me ask you a question.
how do you know you haven't told me already where the other bodies are buried?
we've been through everything.
he marked up Rossi's books. Check the bookcase.
maybe he was scouting for locations to commit more murders.
pictures. - What?
framed photographs in his hallway. Nothing else...
nothing else is framed. They look like originals.
let me call you right back, Hotch. - Ok.
I need to ask you about your sex life.
that's personal.
your boyfriend's a serial killer.
your relationship is no longer private.
I-it's completely normal to experiment with sex.
OK. It might be normal to have sex in a public park, but the other things?
we were just role-playing.
every couple has fantasies. Did you ever think it was strange that your boyfriend has fantasies about strangling and raping women?
not women. Just me.
did he... kiss you on the forehead, too?
how did you know that?
now, were you sick much as a kid?
I got strep throat every flu season.
did you just profile that about me?
her name was Zoe Hawkes-- the girl you killed 3 days ago.
we found your DNA on her forehead.
it'll never be admissible in court.
her body was removed from a state facility and now, most people would ask what you did.
I know what you did.
you kissed her on the forehead.
what I what to know is, why?
why do you think someone would do that, agent Rossi?
well, that's why I asked if you had been ill much as a child.
you see, you're slight, pale, sickly.
most parents, they kiss their children on the forehead to see if their temperature is warm.
now, my theory is that you, somehow in your development,
warped that caring gesture into something perverse.
so, did you sit next to zoe to see if she got cold?
is that why you kissed her?
that's a really interesting theory.
make a great chapter in one of your books.
Yeah, Reid.
I found pictures on his computer in a special folder he created.
they're scenic places in the city.
3 of them I recognize from his crime scenes.
there are more pictures of places I don't recognize.
email them as soon as you can. - All right.
this guys getting off on those photos.
then what does he need Linda for?
did he have any other strange preferences in bed?
no.
did he ever role play by tying you up?
no - are you sure? - Yes.
I'm sure.
it was really the only way he could get excited.
what do you mean?
well, he didn't... like... having sex in bed.
so he just took me to public places.
where?
do I have to tell you this?
please. - Ok.
the first time was...
at Kingsbury Park.
and then...
at a movie theater.
in the parking lot, in my car.
did he ever take you to the second street bridge, off the bike path?
Yeag, that's where the jogger was killed.
he can only have sex with Linda when he's revisiting his crimes.
if that's the case, what were they doing in the park where we picked them up?
I need you to write down for me all the places he took you to have sex.
the D. A.'s not gonna need to negotiate a deal with you.
cedar park, Edgewater Channel, Cuyahoga Valley Park, Euclid Creek.
we'll send units in the morning to search for the bodies.
how'd you find out?
is it something that I did?
you needed to revisit the crime scenes because it was the only way for you to get a gratifying sexual release.
but revisiting the scenes wasn't enough.
you had to capture it on film, put it on your computer,
display it on your wall, so you could look at it every day.
Eric, we should talk privately.
this isn't over.
I always knew i'd end up back in prison.
just a matter of when.
you can come interview me if you want.
I read in one of your books that's how you built your behavioral database, right?
maybe you can learn something from me.
I got a lot of questions myself.
I'll be honest with you if you're honest with me.
cause the one thing that you always ask is the one that I don't understand.
Why?
I have no idea why.
I see a guy walking down the street with a stupid look on his face
and I want to bash him over the head with a bottle.
to me that's normal.
it's weird to me that no one else feels that way.
it's all I think about.
I can't stop.
this is not up for debate.
cancel the rest of the dates.
is everything ok?
why do people want to hear me talk about serial killers?
is it that entertaining?
there's a public fascination with them.
sometimes I wonder if my books are doing more harm than good.
my senior year at Georgetown...
I was graduating, I did not have a clue what I was gonna do with my life.
and one day I was in the campus bookstore and you were there,
promoting your second book. I sat through your whole talk.
you never told me.
I asked you what it was you were most proud of,
and you showed us a picture of a boy from Charleston.
brent Roberts. A neighbor took him.
he was found alive. One of the few.
that night, I bought your book, applied to the academythe next fall.
I'll see you at the airport.
austrian novelist Marie Von Ebner-Eschenbach wrote:
in youth we learn. In age we understand.
I hear you caught him.
we did.
is he going to prison?
for the rest of his life.
it doesn't make me feel better.
he's alive, Zoe's not.
but she'd be pleased that you caught him.
I hope so.
Ian Doyle vanished from prison. Interpol can't find him.
am I in danger?
we all are.
Prentiss, get down!
we're looking for a European team with considerable training.
for one of them, it's personal.
Hey, what's that?
bank accounts traceable to our first two victims.
we might be able to match the rest of those faces.
Hello, Lauren.
Oh, wait. Lauren Reynolds died in a car accident, didn't she?
come near my team and I will end you.
you took the only thing that mattered to me.
so I'm gonna take the only thing that matters to you...
your life.
all the federal and international agents responsible for tracking him down are now on his list of targets.
this is the guy I told you about.
he told me everything but a name.
pleasure.
I love being the man bringing people together.
have fun, kids.
Jack told me you were provisional IRA. - Used to be.
then the peace accord happened.
now I gotta look for work like everybody else.
Except...Ian...
that's a protestant name, isn't it?
not a lot of protestants in the IRA or is that how you proved you were a good fighter, defending your mother for giving you that name?
and what is it you do, Lauren?
right now I'm trying to get into business with a former IRA Captain.
he's gone freelance. You might have heard of him.
Yeah. I might know him.
well... Since this is sensitive...
it might be better to discuss this privately.
you're just full of surprises, aren't you?
you have no idea.
I said out!
get out of here, Fahey.
do you know who I am?
I am the man. I used to run this block.
now you're just a bum. Out!
I got 4 names on the bottom of the list prentiss gave us.
all with the initials l. R.
the CIA uses cryptograms like that to assign to non-official cover agents working the same case.
so do other foreign countries.
these last 4 names are covers...
spies. - Wait.
no. This isn't right.
do you see this space? That shouldn't be here.
could it be a formatting error?
no, this is a spreadsheet template.
formatting doesn't allow for this.
there's a missing name on here.
it's another spy whose cover is l. R.
Lauren Reynolds is dead.
Lauren Reynolds is dead. - What?
"Lauren Reynolds is dead." Prentiss said that on a phone call 17 days ago.
but her intonation wasn't surprise or grief.
it was like a mantra, like she was reminding herself.
Lauren Reynolds, l.R.
if Prentiss is the last name on that list, she's on Doyle's list, too.
that explains her behavior the past month.
the secrets, the evasion.
she's been biting her fingernails again, too.
guys.
she left her badge and gun? Why would she do that?
that doesn't make sense. Why run? We're her family.
we can help.
Doyle's killing families.
she's not married, not close to relatives.
he was ready to wipe us out.
she ran to protect us.
battery's dead, Fahey.
jeez, Lauren.
she's a trained spy. She doesn't want to be found.
she knows all of our tricks. We don't know any of hers.
all right, then how do we find her?
here's how.
Ian Doyle is our unsub, Prentiss is our victim.
we profile their behavior and we treat it like any other case.
because terrorism isn't an area we specialize in,
I've reached out to an expert from the state department, someone who can also shed light on Prentiss' past.
who? - Her.
let's get to work.
how many men does Doyle have, Jack?
I haven't seen that guy in a...
15, maybe 20 guys.
any surprises?
just automatic weapons. It's mostly local mob guys.
there's a little bit of IRA ...
Lauren, how about you do me a favor, huh, you ease up on that gun, ok?
I helped you and Clyde back in the day. I can help you now.
do you want to know where Doyle is?
I already do.
Yeah, but what are you gonna do, huh, take him out on your own?
what are you gonna do, tell him?
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
the secret to getting away with lying "is believing with all your heart.
that goes for lying to yourself even more so than lying to another.
author Elizabeth Bear.
OK, so I talked to a friend from Langley.
he couldn't give me Emily's full CIA history, but he could give me this.
she assumed the identity of Lauren Reynolds as part of a special task force called JTF-12.
I heard about them.
they were profiling terrorists, weren't they?
Yeah, assembled after 9-11.
CIA and Western agencies contributed their best and brightest.
but serial killers and terrorists have different personality traits.
how does Doyle fit in?
he was their last case.
and now the JTF is on his hit list.
Jeremy wolff was victim number one, from Germany's BND.
Sean McAlister at interpol was the second.
he's the one that brought the JTF in to work the Doyle case.
he was murdered last week in Brussels with his wife and daughter.
Tsia Mosely of France's DCRI.
she got engaged to Jeremy earlier this year.
after he died, she fled to D. C. And team leader Clyde Easter, British mi6
he hasn't checked in since Tsia's murder. He was also in D. C.
did JTF make the arrests?
no, the host countries handled that.
the team moved on to the next case.
if all they did was deliver a profile, how does Doyle even know about them?
well, considering the shadowy nature of terrorist cells, they utilize a skill we don't infiltration
who was undercover on Doyle? - Emily.
she made contact with him in Boston to get intel on Valhalla.
she was posing as another weapons dealer.
look at how she's dressed.
she seems awfully comfortable.
how close did she get to Doyle as part of her cover?
the recon they did on Doyle included a background of all of his romantic relationships.
Emily was his type.
she asked you to stop here yesterday?
Yeah. Change her boots and...
get whatever she needed, I guess.
it's never easy, you know, having to dig through a friend's life.
but that's not what's bugging you, is it?
you're angry because she crossed the line with Doyle.
no, I'm not.
I'm angry because a group of mercenaries just shot at me.
I don't much like being shot at, Rossi.
Prentiss knew exactly what was going on, but she didn't bother to tell any of us.
she couldn't without putting us at risk.
come on, man, we don't know that.
all we do know is that she slept with a terrorist for a profile.
and instead of coming clean with us about her dirty laundry, she just ran with it.
you think it's that simple?
till there's a reason not to.
well... Here's one.
that's her passport, the real one.
now, if you wanted to vanish, wouldn't you take that with you?
this doesn't mean anything.
I worked with that woman for 5 years.
I put my life in her hands.
I called her my friend.
but right now I can't even say that I ever really knew her.
can you?
there's something down there.
what do you got?
it's called a Gimmel ring.
the husband and wife-to-be wear individual bands during the engagement and combine them at the wedding.
you see the markings in the middle?
Gaelic. Doyle gave it to her.
this ring is more than just a souvenir.
otherwise, why hang on to it all this time?
why hide it from us?
what makes you think she went to Boston?
well, the Doyle case started in Boston.
maybe she's going back to old locations trying to hunt him down.
if he had us in his crosshairs, she wouldn't run.
she'd take the fight to him.
pack up this stuff. I want to be out of here in 48 hours.
open it.
Liam, something bothering you?
none of our other suppliers can get stuff this good.
she's too good to be true, and you're too blind to see it.
shut it.
get in the car, the second one.
I'll take care of her. - Right.
you always ride in the second car. Why?
because the first car takes the hit in an ambush.
are you going to...
take care of me?
Yes, I am.
good.
I need to ask you something.
you never ask me about my, you know, about my business, about Valhalla.
why is that?
I just...Assume you'll tell me when you're ready to tell me.
well, uh, there is something I want to tell you.
I was gonna get you the ring, but, uh, you said you're not the marrying type.
Oh... It's... It's beautiful.
look at me. I am Valhalla.
I have no idea what kind of life we're gonna have, but...
I just want you in mine.
sir, Tsia got a hit on one of Clyde Easter's covers.
he's on a plane to Boston as we speak.
have him detained as soon as he steps off. We need to go.
Garcia, you're coming with us.
OK, yes.
your government's gonna hear about this.
will you call the British consulate, please?
british consulate, now!
step back, sir.
you're being detained as a suspect in a murder investigation.
wonderful.
Hey, it's me.
Hotch asked me to try all your numbers, and I have this as an old listing, and you probably don't even use it anymore, but if it is you and you're out there, come home, please.
God, Emily, what did you think, that we would just let you walk out of our lives?
I am so furious at you right now!
then I think about how scared you must be, how you're in some dark place all alone.
but you're not alone, ok?
you are not alone. We are in that dark place with you.
we are waving flashlights and calling your name.
so if you can see us, come home.
if you can't, then...
then you stay alive.
cause we're coming.
I only want Doyle. Where's Doyle?
right here, love.
right here.
there it is.
Hello, love.
Emily walked into a trap.
it looks like Doyle got into the SUV, but from this angle, you can see that he didn't.
which I wish Boston PD would have told me before I started watching it.
sorry again for the screaming.
she threw a flash-bang grenade into a car.
she's lucky the 3 people inside didn't die.
is anybody else bothered by that?
well, 3 bad guys.
illegal as it is, I think Prentiss knows she has to be as ruthless as Doyle.
he's come to the US to wage a public vendetta and hired a group of mercenaries to remain loyal to him.
he has nothing to lose, so she has to act the same way.
so how did Doyle know she was waiting for him?
well, the mole must have told him, right?
the same guy who's been feeding Doyle the contractors and agents?
and our best suspect was just arrested with a suitcase full of cash.
how do we get Easter to talk?
he won't cooperate willingly.
I'll handle that. The rest of you focus on Doyle's location.
I hate to be the one to ask this, but how long does Emily have?
her best chance is also the most troubling.
Doyle saved her for last because he views her as his stressor.
which means he'll take his time.
Where's my ring?
I flushed it.
I spent 7 years in hell because of that ring.
so now I'm going to give you another gift, one you won't get rid of so easily.
a four-leaf clover should be a nice addition to your other tattoos.
you still have two, right?
Yep. And that's enough ink, thanks.
ink?
north Koreans can't afford ink.
no, no. They brand themselves.
the more you fight, the more this will hurt.
get your hands off me!
do you know who I am? I'm the man!
who's that?
Jack Fahey, Irish mob.
he called Easter's cell phone 12 times in 6 hours.
any connection to Doyle?
Boston PD says he's low level.
but the Irish mob has long-standing ties to the IRA.
see if you can get anything out of him.
why are you doing this?
why are you keeping me alive?
FBI grabbed Fahey.
her people.
it won't be long before he starts squealing and they're banging on our door.
do what you have to so we get the hell out of here.
I know what you want.
you want Lauren Reynolds back.
I can do that.
I can be her.
you think that'll save your skin?
I have no illusions.
but I'm tired of this.
of being afraid.
we don't have time for this.
we'll make time.
what about Fahey?
I'll take care of Fahey.
he smokes, right?
Aye.
looks like you earned yourself a reprieve.
october 2006.
in closing, I have never worked with a finer agent than Emily prentiss.
her skill at analyzing and predicting terrorist behavior is unparalleled.
signed, name redacted.
you sold her to us the same way you sold Doyle to the north Koreans.
just because you know how I profile doesn't mean you know me.
it takes a skilled sociopath to betray his team and the cause he held dear for self-preservation.
if you cooperate with us and we save agent prentiss, then maybe we could talk about a deal.
but if anything happens to her, I will destroy you.
you can count on that.
she said you were the best.
I'm unimpressed.
we'll get Doyle with or without you.
pack lightly. Guantanamo gets humid.
nice try.
Oh, but...but I'm curious...
if I'm a sociopath, I should feel no empathy, correct?
you're not the sociopath.
Doyle is.
I thought you were a better profiler.
why were you calling Clyde Easter so much, Jack?
anybody got a smoke?
how about you, beanpole?
what do you think?
narcissism masking deep-seated insecurity.
so if we puncture his self-image, this hood rat will talk.
Hey, hey, hey, I ain't no hood rat. You take that back.
well, you look like one.
you smell like one.
you smell that? - Hood rat.
I am not! Take it back!
do you know what a hood rat is?
you see what I mean?
he's just gonna have to learn the hard way.
all right, all right, look, Clyde was gonna pay my medical bills, all right?
this ear, it ain't growing back.
what happened to it?
this bitch teammate of his shot it.
said it was a warning.
thought she could take on this IRA Big shot named Doyle.
so I told these...What the hell, man?! Jeez!
Where's Prentiss?
who? I don't know! - Lauren Reynolds.
where is Lauren Reynolds?
friend of yours, is she?
you tell us where she is right now, or I swear, I'll send you to a prison where they'll teach you what a hood rat is.
and by the time you do, she'll be in pieces.
so, uh... My price just went up.
200, 000?
what other leverage do we have?
is he an addict?
he's having a nicotine fit.
we wouldn't let him smoke.
we could use that. He'd relax, open his big mouth.
is that enough?
well, I'm pretty good with narcissists.
dated a few.
and what is it you do...
I'm looking to get into business with a former IRA Captain who's gone freelance.
but since this is sensitive...
it might be better to discuss this privately.
you're just full of surprises, aren't you?
let me out of these.
that's not how it went.
I can't make you happy in handcuffs.
you really think I'd let you fool me twice?
I just wanted...
I know what you wanted...a way into my head.
but I changed the locks.
so you're going to suffer the way I suffered.
this won't be the first time you've killed an innocent, but it will be the first time you have to watch.
you know when a cigarette is best?
after sex with me.
mind your manners.
all right. You're already extorting us for Prentiss' location.
so, just out of curiosity, what's it like working for Doyle?
eh, he's not so tough.
you got him?
acquiring.
which one's the target?
No! This was about you and me!
that's what you said! You and me!
then why is your team here?
cause I didn't leave a trail.
Ian... Whatever you want to do to me, I accept, but leave them out of it.
Yes, except I didn't bring them into it, did I?
what are you thinking?
woman first, then the goateed fella.
and then Fahey if he has a shot.
if not, he'll shut up.
Yeah. Sounds about right.
shoot Fahey.
if he dies, my team doesn't have anything.
Hello, Lauren.
good to see you again.
I bet you're his hookup, aren't you?
I mean, after all, you're the man.
I could show you how much of a man I really am.
all right, all right, all right, jeez.
what's with the sexy cop/ bad cop routine?
what do you two think...
down!
that's not going to come out.
Yeah, I know.
Ashley, we have a problem.
without Fahey, there's not much left.
we all want to save Prentiss so bad that we can't see this case straight.
OK. What do we do?
we depend on the team member with the freshest eyes.
Oh, no. Not me, no.
you haven't worked with Prentiss for 5 years.
you're unprejudiced.
now, what's been bugging you since we left Quantico?
how about the affair?
that bugs me.
how does the two of them sleeping together change Doyle's profile?
I don't know.
come on, Ashley. It's textbook.
I haven't read every textbook.
you want me to hold your hand?
fine. What doesn't fit?
just say it!
what are you thinking?
spit it out! - Why families?
keep going.
Prentiss is Doyle's stressor.
he wants revenge on the woman who betrayed him, and I understand that.
but why kill that child in D. C?
that's the agent Seaver I'm looking for.
come on.
let's get you a new shirt.
so, assuming Clyde isn't the mole, we looked through the JTF's personal records again, and Jeremy made some fancy plans before his death.
specifically, he bought a large estate in Spain...
he signed all the documents with one of his covers.
made a down payment in cash, deposited the rest.
so Jeremy sold the list to Doyle.
he was the first victim, killed quietly.
Doyle didn't want any attention until he was ready.
did Tsia know?
I can't tell.
if I were running from a terrorist, I would cash in my IRA Not that one.
the other...you know what I mean.
my point is, Tsia didn't touch that money, so I don't think she's in on it.
did you know that Jeremy sold the list to Doyle?
I had my suspicions.
so when you got to D. C.you couldn't trust Tsia, either.
Prentiss read your doubt as duplicity and so did we.
well, you could have just asked me who Doyle's plant was.
would you have told me?
no.
someone we both care about is in trouble.
I need the original profile when Doyle was a terrorist.
we combine that with who he is now as a serial killer.
agent Hotchner, you took an oath to protect the laws of your country, and I took one to protect the secrets of mine.
do you understand what you're asking?
I know it's not easy. - I'll do it.
if you join me.
you see, there's no catching that man.
he'd escape from your prison as easily as he did in north Korea.
and then, all hell breaks loose.
if you want to stop that man, you have to put a bullet between his eyes yourself.
can you do that?
can you break your oath, agent Hotchner?
no.
can you take one, then?
can you swear that your team will save her?
Yes.
the British consul's here.
could you tell him I'll be right out?
I'm consulting with the BAU on a case.
Ian Doyle's a power-assertive psychopath, highly controlling and very explosive when something doesn't go as planned.
OK, so how does this fit in with who he is as a family annihilator?
and Prentiss' role in it.
Annihilators have a romanticized view of who their family is.
well, actually, he was an orphan.
well, they think of family as their possession, until some law shatters that and starts them killing.
but Doyle was never married.
children? - No.
you run your profile that he carried out his murders with surgical-like precision.
Yes. - With no collateral damage.
that's right.
perhaps this child was a surrogate for one he had.
say Doyle had a child and you didn't know about it.
is it possible that Prentiss did?
then why would she keep it from me?
who else was in the compound the day that you arrested Doyle?
just his staff. - All Irish?
Yeah.
that's a start.
when Fahey told me you were in the city, he said you already knew where I was.
if that's the truth, you know what this is about.
game's over, love.
time for your last confession.
take me to where he died.
I want to see it.
breathe, just breathe.
ready or not, here I come!
Aww, I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get you!
I don't see you.
I don't see you.
I'm gonna get you!
come take your boy, please.
you ever think about that?
having kids?
be a little hard with what we do, don't you think?
maybe you need the right man to do it with.
and a son who's crazy about you.
I...I thought he was your housekeeper's.
Louise raises Declan so no one can use him against me.
but he's mine.
and he needs a mother.
I can't do that.
not here.
then I'll get you out.
or... I could get you out.
I have resources.
contacts. He would be safer.
and he'd have a father.
you know what I am, Lauren.
a warrior.
I lead warriors.
I raise warriors.
I can't just leave.
you want me to raise your son so he can have your life?
is it that bad a life?
there are so many things I would do to make you happy.
but...
I can't do this.
go to your father.
"go to your father." That's what you said.
I never told anyone the truth about Declan. You were the only one.
and you put him in your profile, didn't you?
Yes. - For 2 years, I didn't talk.
the north Koreans used everything you gave them against me.
it wasn't until they showed me these...
they laughed at me as I wept.
and you caused all of this, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
that corner right there, that's where he died.
and that's where I'm going to kill you.
there's something you don't know about those photos.
I got him!
I matched Irish immigration records based on Doyle's employees.
Declan Jones, he's the only boy who matches.
he settled in Boston 8 years ago, adoptive guardian Louise Jones.
I knew Louise Jones. She was Doyle's housekeeper.
are they still alive?
Declan and his mother went missing 7 years ago.
bodies were never found.
wait, what is this?
Uh...God, someone took pictures of them being shot.
is there an address?
that looks like a warehouse.
it's gotta be big enough to house a small army.
that's weapons, supplies. Let's see...
which means it has its own perimeter.
I got it, 1518 Adams street.
after your arrest, I relocated Louise and Declan.
and then I got a call.
Interpol had sent back our profile.
the head of the terrorism division wanted more dirt on you so they could break you.
so you used my son as a promotion.
no. I wouldn't let him be a pawn.
the things they would have done to him to get you to talk...
but I knew, even if I didn't cooperate, they were going to find him eventually.
so I had to... - had to what?!
I had to end his suffering before it could begin.
wait, wait, look at that.
Morgan, come look at this.
what did you do? You put him in the profile.
what else did you do?
I put him in the profile after the pictures were taken.
it's black clothing and a hand, reid.
no, look at the fingernails.
Oh, my God!
you don't know when those pictures were taken. You don't know that.
Yes, I do. I'm the one holding the gun.
you want to hear his lasts words to me?
he said,"I looked pretty good for a dead kid, didn't I?
and then he got on the plane and I never saw him again.
he's alive?!
just because I held a gun to him doesn't mean I shot him.
I only had to make you and the north Koreans believe he was dead.
agent Prentiss is the only friend in the building.
rescuing her is our primary objective.
our only advantage here is stealth.
once they know we're on site, there's nothing to stop them from killing her.
so we keep it quiet until we get to her.
I know you're lying!
I beat you, Ian...
before you even got out of north Korea.
I beat you.
cause I gave Declan his life back.
I'll find him.
no, you won't.
ever since you told me my people had Fahey, I've been stalling you.
cut the power.
where is he?
Where's Declan, Emily?
tell me. Tell me. Where is he?
Emily, tell me where he is.
no.
I got her! I got her in the basement on the South side. I need a medic.
Hey, it's me, I'm right here.
you're gonna be all right.
stay with me, baby. Come on, stay with me.
let me go.
no, no. I am not letting you go.
help me!
listen to me, I know why you did all of this.
I know what you did for Declan.
I'm so proud of you.
do you understand that? I am proud of you because you are my friend, and you are my partner.
no, Emily! Come on, stay with me.
if you can hear me, please just squeeze my hand.
Yes, there you go. There you go, baby. Just keep squeezing.
no.
she never made it off the table.
I didn't get a chance to say good-bye.
passports from 3 different countries, and a bank account in each one to keep you comfortable.
thank you. - Good luck.
psychoanalyst Walter Langer wrote, "people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one.
and if you repeat it frequently enough, people will sooner or later believe it."
this cream is a miracle.
my fine lines and sagging skin are gone.
I look like a different person.
Hey! Bro! Thanks for the referral.
painting the Smith house today.
Hey, it's me.
heads up.
someone's got eyes on us.
I need to come in.
Synalock. May I help you?
he's on a conference call, but he should be off in a few minutes.
Mr. Werner's not available. Can I have him return?
thank you.
what? You changed your hair.
no. Not really.
Hey. Just give me a second. What do I have this morning?
OK, move London to 12: 30 and reschedule lunch with Caldwell.
so, what's going on?
I don't know. You tell me.
don't shoot!
it's today?
I can't. I've got a big meeting.
fine. Put her on.
Hi, sweetheart. I know.
OK. Well, mom's gonna record the pageant.
I know. I wish I could be there, too.
OK. Break a leg, honey.
Hey, good morning.
Oh, look at you spoiling me. Thank you.
Where's yours? Oh, I quit caffeine.
trying to relax more. Well, don't relax too much.
you got 10 hours of takedown and arrest procedure training to recertify.
since when? Since the hearing.
am I the only one? Prentiss, you've been away.
Oh, yeah. I guess I can't complain.
well, especially not to your trainer.
Oh! You're doing it?
don't get too excited. I'm about to put you through the wringer. You can believe that.
workplace massacre this morning at Synalock Incorporated.
that's in Charlottesville, which is practically our own backyard.
that's a high body count. Yeah, 8 victims in total.
all employees, including the CEO.
5 were shot, 3 were stabbed to death.
a gun and a knife. That's highly unusual.
it could be two killers.
that would be the first time for a workplace killing.
their business is Internet security for corporations.
they didn't have video surveillance? They just moved into a new building.
they didn't have time to set up their system yet.
how is it no one heard or saw anything? This killer was prepared.
highly organized. This was premeditated.
he kept his emotions contained. Pretty hard to do for the typical workplace killer who's mentally ill or outraged about some perceived injustice.
the high body count indicates a hell of a lot of rage.
one employee, John Owen, was MIA.
local P. D. haven't been able to locate him yet. Any unhappy clients?
or a domestic situation among the employees?
don't know, but your friendly neighborhood genius girl will find out.
bottom line is a mass killing is a classic show of force.
it's a way to become known.
which is why suicide, often by cop, is usually part of the plan.
so where's the unsub?
he has a reason to stay hidden. He's not finished yet.
men are not prisoners of fate, but prisoners of their own minds.
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
agent Hotchner? I'm Trooper Long from the Bureau of Crime Investigation.
appreciate you coming so quickly.
Absolutely. These are Agents Rossi and Jareau and Dr. Reid.
so a Fed Ex carrier called it in? At 8: 03, on his early route.
no one expect to go to work and never come home, but today at Synalock, a new company providing internet security...
after the news broke, half the town called in sick.
understandable. The media's in a frenzy.
a press briefing from you guys would calm them down.
of course. As soon as we make our assessment.
so what do we know about the missing employee so far?
apparently he's a programmer.
we have an unconfirmed report of a neighbor seeing his car near his home this morning.
you said the CEO's office was ransacked? Yes. Adam Werner's office.JJ.
this is the first victim we found, Nathan Munz.
the position of the body suggests he was one of the last ones killed.
he tried to escape and almost made it to the exit.
Jane Burney and Vinia Dev were here.
Jane tried to run, Vinia didn't. How do you know?
she's half under her desk, which means she tried to hide and the unsub found her.
so these 3 were stabbed and the rest were shot to death.
have you considered two killers?
Yes, but the bloody footprints all seem to come from the same pair of shoes.
given the violence, if there were a second killer, he'd be hard-pressed to get away without leaving tracks.
if there was only one unsub, he used his gun first, emptied his magazine, didn't have a replacement, and resorted to using his knife.
he'd have to be physically fit or at least intimidating enough to subdue so many people.
if this were highly premeditated, he would have brought enough ammunition to kill everyone.
unless he had a single target.
he killed the rest of them because they were witnesses.
we need to figure out who his first victim was.
these are contracts Synalock had.
what was the unsub looking for?
maybe he was a client searching for his own contract to hide any connection to Synalock after the murders.
Ah, everything's digital these days, though. The hard copy's just a backup.
so the unsub's looking for an object, an old record, something not on a computer.
huh. Rossi, check this out.
so, uh, Werner was worried enough about his safety to be armed.
and he didn't have time to go for his gun or didn't perceive the threat to be immediate.
or keeping a gun around was out of force of habit.
he was a veteran.
a naval officer by the looks of it.
a decorated one at that.
he was awarded the Navy Cross in 2000.
something else used to be here.
another picture frame.
blood splatter overlay patterns indicate victim number 3 was over here.
victim number 2 right here.
and finally victim number one right here.
Adam Werner was killed first? - Looks that way.
which means the unsub made it all the way in here without alarming anyone.
he wasn't threatening. That's why Werner didn't pull the gun we found in his office.
he could have been the missing employee.
he may have taken that photo from his office if he was in it.
why would an employee be interested in Synalock's contracts?
maybe this is about one client.
he could be after specific company information.
he had another motive besides killing.
hello. Dad, it's me.
Hey, Luke. Your mother and I were just talking about you.
dad, listen to me. Has anyone called you, asked you any questions?
about what?
about me.
no. What's this about? There's a situation.
what sort of situation?
I'll tell you about it when I see you.
in the meantime, don't answer your phone or your door, ok?
Why? I'm on my way there now.
you've reached Jenna. Leave a message.
Hey, it's Luke.
uh, look, I know you don't want to hear from me.
but something's come up and I need to know that you and Ally are safe, ok?
call me. Bye.
it was clean and fast.
he sliced through the left carotid and abdominal aorta, major arteries that would bleed out quickly.
killed with an economy of motion.
Yes. And all 3 stab victims had similar wounds.
what about the shooting victims?
they all took two . 45s to the chest, except for Adam Werner.
he took 4 body shots and one to the head, execution style.
definite overkill. Somebody was angry with the boss.
somebody with hunting skills. Or a law enforcement background?
thank you.
mom? Dad?
hey Luke! There you are. Mother's upstairs. She was worried that something happened.
it's good to see you, buddy.
dad?
what have you done to my father?
what are you talking about? I'm right here.
I'm right here.
what's wrong?
is this about the mission? What mission?
what's wrong with you?
what have you done to my father?
talk to me, little genie.
well, since you know how to rub my lamp, your wish is my command.
I checked the Synalock client list, and the Defense Intelligence Agency is new to them, so there really isn't anything to report, and everyone else is crazy happy with their service.
no complaints logged online?
zero. I'm talking every high-tech blog, every chat room, glowing accolades.
no one had anything contrary to say about Synalock.
any employees have a history of domestic disturbances or stalkers?
not that I'd violate privacy laws to check, she says, but the answer is no. So Synalock is clean.
Mm-hmm. As a whistle. Which reminds me...
you know how to whistle, don't you?
you just put your lips together and blow.
I love it when you talk old movies. Later, baby girl.
with all the overkill on Werner, there's got to be a personal connection.
we've located John Owen, the missing employee.
he's been at a Doctor Who convention in San Diego since Saturday.
it was a scheduled vacation. Lucky guy.
I'll say. That's supposed to be an awesome convention.
so if it wasn't someone connected to the workplace, who is it?
you know, given the precision of the kills, it could be someone with a military background.
or a professional hired by a business competitor.
a hit man would just kill Werner.
killing the entire office seems unprofessional.
werner was a Navy veteran.
he had D.I.A. contracts. He had close ties to the military.
it could be someone from his past harboring an old grudge.
trooper, issue a Be on The Lookout to law enforcement for a physically fit male in his 30s to 40s, possibly a veteran.
he appears nonthreatening and blends in easily.
he's armed and extremely dangerous.
he most likely will kill again, either himself or others, very soon.
what do you know about Dorado Falls?
nothing. Is this because of Jenna?
what did you do to Jenna?
Luke, please, stop this, I'm begging you, your mother, her heart is weak.
whatever's wrong, we'll help you. This is your last chance.
you tell me where Mark and Mary Dolan are.
I'm Mark Dolan. I'm your father.
for the love of God! Please, Luke, we're your parents.
Luke, please! For the love of God, please.
please, Luke! I'm Mark Dolan! I'm your father!
for God's sake!
are we sure the unsub is their son?
Luke Dolan called Synalock early this morning. Garcia confirmed it.
know many 60-year-olds with a boom box?
trying to mask the sound of the gunshots?
could be. Or he was torturing them with sound.
why were they bound and gagged in the closet?
why not just kill them right away?
maybe he was trying to get information from them.
about what?
go ahead, Garcia, you're on speaker.
OK, Luke Dolan was in the same Navy unit as our CEO Adam Werner.
that would be the 212th.
they were both communication clerks at Camp Patriot in Kuwait.
I'm sending all this information to your emails now. Any other family?
he has a wife, Jenna. They've been separated for years. She lives in Bethesda with her 8-year-old daughter.
we need to bring her in for protective custody and to interview her.
send local P. D. and have our nearest unit meet them. Done and done.
OK, it looks like he served 13 years, honorable discharge in 2005.
and now a VP of a biotech company.
he was never a Synalock employee. So, what happened to this guy?
he was separated from his wife about a year ago, but that's a bit far back to be a trigger.
well, he's unstable.
he's on a rampage of some kind.
what if mentally he was reliving a combat situation?
it could be post-traumatic stress.
everybody could look like an enemy.
Prentiss, this was a close-knit family.
look at them.
they couldn't have been more proud of their son.
how bad would his disorder have to be to make him kill his own parents?
post-traumatic stress disorder rarely turns people into killers, but soldiers with PTSD have been known to strangle their wives in bed while having flashbacks or nightmares, believing they're on the battlefield.
in 2005, an Iraqi war vet assaulted two people in Las Vegas, believing them to be enemy combatants.
so Dolan's having a sustained flashback.
pathological disassociation is one of the markers of complex PTSD, although Dolan has been stateside for 6 years.
an escalation of the symptoms is possible, but it would be rare for them to appear out of nowhere.
well, he seems to have made a successful transition to civilian life.
well, at least on paper it does. We should find out if he's had any symptoms since he left the Navy.
it could have been the catalyst for the separation. I'll have Garcia check his records.
Hotch, Dolan's been going through this.
look, old mementos and journals from his days in the service.
he didn't come here just to kill his parents. He came to get something.
he's on some sort of mission.
the car's washed, spotless inside, there's no paint separation or rust.
this accident was recent. I agree.
the Navy's in his blood.
he would never let that go without getting it fixed immediately.
it might have triggered his condition.
I'll have Garcia run the plates, check for any recent accidents.
so, Dolan left his sedan and didn't take the parents' car.
he was smart enough to know it'd be tracked.
he's either on foot or he's stolen another vehicle.
if he's capable of doing this, he's rational and clear-thinking enough to evade his perceived enemies.
so despite any mental incapacity, he's still performing at a high level.
just got word the local P. D.'s at the wife and daughter's house.
Dolan's unpredictable when he's on a rampage. We need to go wide.
we need to get the profile to the press.
Luke Dolan is a Navy veteran we believe is suffering from PTSD.
a recent trauma may have triggered this.
he is experiencing pathological disassociation and may believe he's in a combat situation.
what this means is, to him, everyone is a potential enemy.
do not underestimate him.
despite his mental state, he has extreme survival skills.
right now, we believe he's within a 250-mile radius of Roanoke.
he is armed and extremely dangerous. JENNA DOLAN'S RESIDENCE
it is important that you do not approach this man.
he believes that he is on a mission, and if threatened, he will kill.
so if you see him, stay away and notify the authorities.
sir. Sir!
all units, suspect is a Navy veteran...
sir, excuse me. Sir, I need you to stop right there.
14, what's your status? This is 14, shutting down Linley Road now.
sir, this road's closed. You'll have to turn around.
what's going on, officer? Official police matter, sir.
be ON THE LOOKOUT: LUKE DOLAN
one thing that's been bothering me is the first victim, Adam Werner, was given the Navy Cross in 2000.
we weren't at war. Exactly.
you have to show extreme sacrifice, risk life and limb to win the second-highest medal of valor.
so what did he do during peacetime to deserve it?
sir, Garcia discovered part of Dolan's military records were encrypted.
I just got the complete file from the Pentagon.
he wasn't a clerk. He was a Navy Seal. Let me guess. Adam Werner was, too.
Yeah. Werner was the seal team leader, Dolan was his number 2.
their unit was part of JSOC.
they were involved in over 20 highly classified missions.
which missions were in 2000? Uh, only one.
operation Dorado Falls.
see what you can find out about it. Will do.
that changes the profile. - Definitely.
how so?
navy Seals are screened carefully for vulnerability to PTSD.
they're resistant to it.
so why would a trained Navy Seal kill his commanding officer and his own parents?
I don't know, but it's gonna be a lot harder to find him.
very few people on this planet are capable of stopping him.
Luke Dolan just evaded a roadblock near his wife's house.
they searched the surrounding area. There's no sign of him.
did you notice any recent changes in Luke's behavior?
I saw him Friday afternoon when he dropped Ally off.
he was fine.
did he ever mention Dorado Falls?
no. What is that?
a mission he was on.
he didn't share that part of his life with me.
Luke was always very good at compartmentalizing.
is that why you two separated?
he's a good man and a wonderful father, but I always felt he was more married to the Navy than me.
you weren't a priority to him?
somebody once told me all Navy Seals had a bolt hole, a secret location outside the country where they had another identity and bank account set up.
and I asked Luke about it once and he didn't deny it.
the fact of the matter is, he was ready to leave in an instant.
he had an exit strategy.
Yeah. That didn't include us.
is daddy gonna be ok?
Oh, honey, come here.
OK, so it turns out 6: 20 Friday night Dolan got in a car accident in Bethesda.
that must have been after he dropped off his daughter.
he suffered minor injuries, he refused medical treatment.
well, his wife said he was fine when he left her.
what was his mental state after the accident?
normal. Field sobriety test came up negative.
that wouldn't rule out drug use. I'd consider schizophrenia, except he's the wrong age for the first psychotic break.
it could be an aneurysm or a brain tumor.
well, one thing's for sure.
he's having a mental breakdown, but what are the specific features of it?
he's not living in a past time and place, he's living in the present, with the capacity and intelligence to evade law enforcement.
honey, grab me a soda, will you?
honey, the movie's starting. You're missing Robert Mitchum.
you want her to live? Tell me where my family is.
he took my husband. Boyd was bleeding and he dragged him out.
Mrs. Milgram. - Is someone from the army helping?
ma'am, listen to me. The FBI is in charge of looking for your husband, but I need you to try to remember what Luke Dolan said.
I can't. It was gibberish.
Yes, you can. Just close your eyes. Ma'am, I believe that you can.
just listen to the sound of my voice and you'll be fine.
just try. Close your eyes.
there you go. Just relax and breathe.
very good.
now, what were you doing before he broke into your house?
I was in the kitchen. I was pouring a drink for my husband.
he takes me to the living room and ties me up.
what does he say? Where are my real parents?
he asks where his real parents are.
how the hell should I know? I don't even know you.
don't play dumb. You replaced them.
does he think your husband did something to them?
he says, "you replaced them."
the replacements are dead.
does he mention Dorado Falls?
Yes. This is about Dorado Falls, isn't it?
and gaslighting. Dorado Falls?
you're gaslighting me 'cause of the mission.
the mission? Who's your commanding officer?
you won't get away with this.
where are you keeping Jenna and Ally?
Where's my family?
he was calm until he asked about his family.
then he hits Boyd with the gun.
all of the Milgrams' cars are still here, so he must have taken the General in whatever vehicle he came in.
he talked about gaslighting.
he thinks someone's trying to purposely distort his reality.
he said his parents had been replaced. He just sounds delusional.
you know, he might have Capgras syndrome.
it's a delusional disorder in which one believes that their friends and loved ones have been replaced by imposters.
sort of like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers."
it typically involves only one sense, such as sight.
basically, the neural connection between the visual cortex and the emotional center of the brain becomes severed, so that looking at a loved one doesn't elicit the same emotional response one would expect.
so you think they're an imposter.
and the interesting thing is that the auditory connection remains intact, so that if they were to hear a loved one speak and not see them, they'd think that they were real.
what causes this syndrome? It's unknown in 60% of the cases, but the rest have an organic cause, such as tumor or head trauma.
he was in a car accident Friday.
people with delusional disorders don't all become killers, though.
true, but Dolan's background as a Navy Seal, his knowledge of secret missions, plus Capgras syndrome, could result in extreme paranoia. It's the perfect storm.
is there a cure for this?
unfortunately, no. Although medications have helped in a few cases.
so this guy's stuck with it. He's not killing for the thrill of it, he does it because he believes he has no other choice.
he murdered his best friend and his parents because he believed they were imposters.
so if he were to see his wife and daughter, the results would be deadly.
Dolan kidnapped the General and didn't kill his wife because he had never met them before.
there might be another reason. He wants contact.
I don't know what you think you're gonna gain by your actions, but I do know this,
you swore an oath to defend this country and behave with moral rectitude.
were you thinking of morals when you gave the go-ahead on Dorado Falls?
I told you, that wasn't me. You're a liar.
this country's at war, and Dorado Falls is nothing but a speck on the radar.
no one even remembers. I remember.
what are you gonna do with me?
I'll trade you for my wife and child.
and if that doesn't work? I'll kill you.
you're not a Navy Seal, you're a disgrace...
defense INTELLIGENCE AGENCY PENTAGON how close are you to getting Dolan?
our primary goal right now is the safe recovery of the General.
this is highly classified information, Agent Jareau.
can't the BAU do this on their own?
we could. But your help would speed things up.
you're smart enough to see the upside, I'm sure.
you help and it goes well, you get your ticket punched.
you don't and it goes south, well, the weather's not too bad outside the beltway.
it's all in there.
you know why Dolan's so worried about this mission?
I have no idea. Were there complications?
every mission has complications.
but there's no blowback on this one, I can assure you of that.
OK.
it just--I can't understand why Luke would do all these awful things.
what's happening to him?
we think his car accident triggered a delusional disorder.
Oh, my God.
we need to know who Luke was closest to.
his father.
hello.
is this Lieutenant Luke Dolan?
who is this?
sergeant Major David Rossi,
united States Marine Corps, retired.
who told you to call me?
I volunteered to call you.
I knew your dad, Mark.
we were in boot camp together at Parris Island.
he's a good man.
still triangulating a location. Hold on.
hold on. Now, we can talk, but first I need to know that General Milgram is safe.
he's alive, if that's what you mean.
what's up with the music? I have no idea.
why did you kidnap the General? For leverage to get my family back.
do you think we're holding them?
I saw you take my wife and child. What have you got, Garcia?
getting closer. We're in the warehouse district. Stand by.
please, stand by.
got it! 3352 Spring Street.
let's go.
release the General and then we can talk about your family.
he's innocent. So you think.
Luke, do you think your father would approve of what you're doing?
I just want my family back.
besides, I didn't start this.
start what? Dorado Falls.
why don't you tell us your side of the story?
you first.
all right.
Dorado Falls was the name of a boat off the coast of Cape Town.
it was owned by a South African diplomat who was selling nuclear secrets to Iran.
so what's the big secret? There isn't one. Don't get me wrong, lives were lost, but there's been far worse missions.
his mind chose Dorado Falls to build a conspiracy around.
this can't be it.
Garcia, it's an empty lot with a cell phone repeater.
give me a rundown on the buildings in the area and the years that they were built.
all over it like cat hair on a sofa.
BTW, I can usually locate a cell phone within 3 meters, but sometimes there are circumstances beyond my control, like physical barriers blocking a signal, not being in the satellite's direct line of sight, which bounces the signal to a repeater.
Garcia, tell me you've got something. Oh, sorry. Yes, I have something.
there is a hotel built in '74 that is scheduled for demo, and there is a warehouse scheduled for loft conversion that was built in 1928.
all right, walls were thicker in the twenties. What's the address of the building?
more GPS signal interference. Exact address is...
291 Hope Street. 291 Hope.
intel failed to identify... Two children aboard the boat.
there was a chance to abort, but we were given orders to go ahead.
someone in the D.I.A. made that final call.
I never knew it was Milgram until now.
sometimes collateral damage can't be avoided.
you know, people that sit in offices always think that.
this is Red Echo. We have unwanted targets.
permission to abort.
negative, Red Echo. The operation is a go.
I repeat, the operation is a go.
you had to shoot those kids, didn't you?
they saw us. They would have blown the mission.
they were witnesses.
just like everyone at Synalock.
someone wants revenge.
we've always known that our own government might disavow us.
they tried to buy Adam with the Navy Cross, but it didn't work, so they've replaced him with an imposter.
and now they're taking my family one by one.
listen, Jenna and Ally are safe.
you expect me to believe that?
I know they're coming after me.
I'll make you an offer.
you let Milgram go and I'll take his place.
I don't want you, I want my family.
the people who have them will not negotiate unless Milgram is freed.
but you need insurance. I get that.
let me take his place. Why would you do that?
because I'm not just a guy behind a desk.
I was a marine with boots on the ground, just like you.
I know what you've been through.
I want you to get your family back.
all right. Where's Hotch and Morgan?
the Spring Street address didn't pan out. They're searching the warehouse right now.
Luke, I need your exact address.
all clear. Clear.
we got the General.
he's still alive. Guys, get him out of here.
now, where the hell is Dolan?
Yeah, he used the radio the mask the sound of his movements.
we're on the move.
this was all part of his plan to find out who was holding his wife and daughter.
but you never said you were FBI. He saw the number I called from.
he'd recognize an FBI prefix.
so, what, he's on his way here to Quantico?
I know the head space he's in. He feels all alone right now.
there is no risk he won't take.
as a Navy seal, he did training here. He knows this place.
all right, alert the guard gates and secure the building.
entry and exit through one door only.
an FBI police officer was just found shot to death in the academy parking structure.
he's already here.
Dolan's photo's already been sent on all internal servers.
he's probably changed his appearance already.
and he's got 13 floors to hide on. We should make a General P. A. announcement.
no. He believes he's on a rescue mission that he can pull off.
as long as he thinks that, he'll stay calm.
I've got hundreds of employees in here and you want me to do nothing? Nothing overt.
have your teams quietly search and seal off each floor.
Garcia, I need you on the building's operations computer.
ready and able, sir. Dolan's got a police radio.
I want all alerts sent through a secure tactical channel.
I can talk to him. He won't hurt me.
we can't take that risk.
you'll be safe in here.
I don't see him. He knows how to be invisible.
I got him. He used the dead officer's I. D.to enter the 7th floor.
seal it off. Nobody in or out.
navy Seals never start a mission without an exfiltration plan.
check the exterior and elevator shafts for riggings.
turning exterior cameras now.
a member of the seal team said Dolan's an expert in explosives, disabling and building them.
also be on the lookout for explosives.
Hello?
is this Sergeant Major Rossi?
Yes. I was hoping you'd call, Luke. Where are you?
right behind you.
OK, ok. Easy, easy.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
all right. Luke, you don't want to be aiming that around.
snipers have the building covered.
you're in the crosshairs right now, I can guarantee that.
windows are bulletproof.
high-density Lexan, right? I'm the one you want.
you can let my team go.
I'll trade you. Give me my wife and daughter.
you have 3 minutes to decide.
is he for real? He'll blow us all up, himself included?
start an evacuation. Can we evacuate everyone in 3 minutes?
Prentiss, I need his wife in here.
no one is seeking revenge here.
you've created this conspiracy in your own mind.
you took my family.
to protect them from you after you murdered your own parents.
they were imposters. You have my real parents.
your real parents are dead.
Spence-- you want to know what's really going on?
you were in a car accident 3 nights ago and you suffered a head trauma.
if I don't see Jenna and Ally now...
we're all gonna die.
can you hear me?
I need you to stop what you're doing.
we're fine.
me and Ally are safe.
Luke, you have to let those people go.
the terms haven't changed.
you don't believe that's her? I've been through this before.
you have one minute.
daddy? Why are you doing this?
mommy says you don't feel good.
maybe you need to lie down.
I'm scared, daddy.
I just want to go home.
Jenna, can you talk to him about something personal, something that only the two of you would know about?
do you remember our honeymoon, when you woke me up at night and you took me up that mountain that you'd hiked years before?
we watched the sun rise.
it was magical.
and you said that as much as you loved this spot, you loved me even more.
do you believe it's her now?
your eyes and your mind are playing a trick on you.
when you see your family, you think that they're imposters, but it's all caused by an illness.
you're sick, Luke. It's not your fault.
I love you, daddy.
we both do.
come on, now, Luke, you don't need that gun.
none of us want to hurt you. You are a hero to this country.
please let us help you.
I want to see Jenna. Then you have to do as I ask.
put your weapon down and close your eyes.
Luke, you have to close your eyes. Why?
because you need to know that your wife is real and your eyes will trick you.
please, Luke.
close your eyes or we will never be together again.
close your eyes. Ok. They're afraid you might hurt me, so they're gonna handcuff you.
and then I'm going to come out, but you have to keep your eyes closed.
I'm right here, baby.
promise me you'll keep your eyes closed.
is that you?
is that really you?
everything's gonna be ok.
but we have to go to the hospital now, ok?
first Jenna's gonna cover up your eyes.
daddy! Daddy, where are you going?
No! No! JJ, let me have him.
daddy!
get him out of here! No! No!
get him out of here! No! No!
we're born alone, we live alone, we die alone.
only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for a moment that we're not alone." Orson Welles.
no, I didn't mandate it.
uh, is everything all right? You ok?
Oh, yeah. I'm good. It's all in a day's work, right?
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
uh, Hotch didn't order my takedown recertification.
do you want to tell me what's really going on?
I just thought we both could use a refresher.
you mean you thought I could use it.
you're nervous about me being back.
Emily. What...you think I'm gonna mess up the team's rhythm.
I get it. But just come out and say it. Morgan.
OK, fine. Yes, I am nervous.
but not about you.
about me.
Emily, I thought I lost you, and I blamed myself.
now, you're back, but I don't want to be worried about losing you again and get distracted.
so you wanted some reassurance.
Yeah, something like that.
Morgan, I cannot imagine what you went through.
it was 7 months of hell.
how can I make it up to you?
I will do whatever it takes.
just give me 10 hours of training.
OK, you got it.
shooting range on Sundays.
I'm there.
and my morning coffee and a neck rub every day.
Oh, buddy, you are really pushing it.
mom, open the door! Please!
mom, open the door!
please don't, mom! Please don't!
please don't. Please!
open the door! Please!
please don't, mom!
mom? Open the door.
mom!
open it!
mom, please.
mom...
come on.
come on, Bobby!
let's go.
let me stay with you.
Oh, don't cry, sweetheart.
come on, please?
I don't want to do this again.
I know, and I'm so, so, so sorry.
everything's gonna be ok.
it's ok.
go on.
what are you doing here?
thank you.
I am really sorry. I had to take that.
it's ok.
fruit plate, huh?
whatever happened to the usual bacon and eggs, extra grease on the side?
well, I've changed.
OK, the cantaloupe is for your benefit.
when we were married, you were always warning me about clogged arteries.
and you would always say to me...
nobody lives forever.
so how's San Francisco? Well, you know.
fog, cable cars, the usual.
you know, I'm really glad you called me.
it would be nice if we saw each other more than once every 3 or 4 years.
maybe we can.
so, give me the updates.
anybody serious in your life?
well, there are all those serial killers.
they're pretty serious. I meant in your personal life.
no, there isn't.
how about you?
you know, David...
I've been wanting
damn it, I... You gotta go.
I know.
it's ok. It's comforting to know that some things never change.
look, how much longer are you gonna be in town?
about a week or so, probably.
why don't you come over to my place for dinner before you head back?
I still make a monster cioppino.
I would like that very much.
great.
Ciao. Ciao.
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up with something. What do we got?
a child abduction in St. Louis.
Yeah. Bobby Smith, 9 years old, vanished 48 hours ago from a residential area, where his mother, Marlene Smith, claims to have dropped him off.
48 hours and we're just learning about it now?
Yeah. That's 'cause mom didn't know her son was gone.
she assumed that he was with the grandmother and just left him there.
so, she's not exactly on the short list for mother of the year. What about the father?
uh, he was convicted of embezzling from his workplace 2 years ago.
currently cooling his heels in state prison.
if it's a stranger abduction, the first 24 hours are critical.
this kid's already been missing twice that long.
which is why we shouldn't waste any more time. Let's go.
I brought you something to eat, Bobby. Gotta go to work now.
when can I see my mom?
I already told you.
we'll talk about your mom later.
No! Don't go!
from childhood's hour I have not been as others were,
I have not seen as others saw.
Edgar Allan Poe. St. Louis.
Oh, probably a couple days.
I'll let you know. Can't wait.
Bye.
what?
nothing. Just somebody's got a lot of extra pep in their step this morning, that's all.
probably doubled up on his vitamins.
Oh, he doubled up on something.
Garcia, what have you got on the mother?
Oh, I have so much on the mother, and try as I might, none of it is good.
Marlene Smith has a history of erratic behavior, seriously clinically depressed, two suicide attempts in the last 5 years.
was she being treated for her depression? Oh, my gosh, yes.
like more pill-popping than Elvis. Yes.
depression is one of the few things that can overwhelm the maternal instinct.
what about the grandmother? I don't have anything on her yet, but don't reach for your remote.
I'll be ba-a-ck. Two suicide attempts.
why hasn't child services intervened? Probably talked her way out of it.
most social service organizations are overworked and underfunded. Things slip through the cracks.
if this boy's mother tried to commit suicide and he's from a chronically unhappy household.
maybe this wasn't an abduction at all. What if Bobby simply ran away?
when 9-year-olds run away, they're usually home for supper.
JJ, you and I will talk to the mother.
morgan and Reid, go to the boy's house.
Prentiss, you and Dave assess the site where the mother claims to have dropped him off.
St. LOUIS POLICE STATION
detective Woods. Glad to have you here.
this is Agent Jareau. Agent.
how's the mother doing? She's a wreck.
can't get much from her till she calms down.
I think you should talk to her alone.
OK. I'll leave you to it.
I'll watch from here.
Mrs. Smith?
I'm Agent Jareau. Jennifer.
I'm with the FBI.
did you hear any more about my Bobby?
no, ma'am.
but our entire team is here and we're the best at what we do.
we're gonna need your help, ok?
OK.
I have a boy of my own. He's almost 3.
I can't even imagine what you are going through.
he's so little.
I know.
can you tell me what happened the morning you dropped him off?
I was having one of my bad days.
and what does one of your bad days look like?
I wanted to hurt myself.
I can't control it.
is that why you took him to his grandmother?
Yeah. See, I have to protect him.
and you had done this in the past?
Yeah.
I just had to get him out of the house.
you know? I just had to get him out of the house.
it's all I kept thinking about was just get him out.
get him out!
cheerful.
depression is a vicious cycle.
it frequently manifests itself in the degradation of one's personal living environment, which in turn fuels the depression, which then worsens the living environment.
all right, I'll take a look around in here. Why don't you check out the kitchen?
Ah, the kitchen. Is that a problem?
frankly, I'm not too anxious to see the perishable food version of this room.
so when I was feeling better,
I went to my mother's to pick him up, and...that's when they told me he wasn't there.
you didn't call ahead before you dropped him off?
Yeah. She didn't answer.
she didn't have an answering machine?
Yeah, she has, but there wasn't time for that.
please help me understand, Mrs. Smith.
it takes 10 seconds to leave a message.
look, these bad days you have I understand.
there, there must be times when
look!
Bobby saw me do this before.
twice.
I had to get him out of the house.
don't you understand?
OK.
four pair of shoes. Why exactly is that relevant?
come on, Reid, how many women you know only have 4 pairs of shoes in their closet?
my experience in and around women's closets isn't exactly extensive enough to really formulate an opinion.
the answer is none. You can take my word for it.
well...
she even set up a separate area so he could do his homework.
mom has serious financial issues, denies herself even the smallest luxury, and yet...
splurges to take her son to an expensive theme park and then buys a pricey picture frame so he can remember the experience.
Hey, buddy.
after work I stopped and got you something.
120 colors.
the biggest box they had.
I want to go home now.
I need to ask you something, Bobby.
your mother, she's unhappy a lot.
would you like it if her pain could stop?
cause I can make that happen.
do you want me to help your mom?
that's good, Bobby.
that means you're strong, like me.
you made the right decision.
wait, where are you going? To help your mom.
why don't you draw a picture while I'm gone.
mother's not a suspect anymore?
based on our assessment, we need to reprioritize.
the concern for her son was genuine.
her tone of voice, body language. She didn't once ask if she was in trouble, under arrest, where's my lawyer? None of that.
home environment points the same direction.
the money's tight, but mom did whatever she could to create a nice world for her son.
whatever cash she had she spent on him. Only 4 pairs of shoes in her closet.
and she taught her son to be self-sufficient.
the kitchen was scaled down to a 9-year-old's level so he could microwave his own meals, get food and utensils from the pantry.
he even had his own little key ring so he could come and go as he pleased.
how'd it go. It took a while, but grandma's alibi checked out.
she was with two lady friends in Seneca, other side of the state.
acquaintances, relatives, teachers.
so far they've all checked out.
this is starting to look more and more like a stranger abduction.
Yeah, except the area Bobby disappeared from has a decent amount of foot traffic.
if he'd put up a struggle, chances are someone would have noticed.
my guess is Bobby knew his abductor or trusted him.
the trip to grandma's house was a spur-of-the-moment decision.
the unsub must have been staking out the mother's house, saw them leaving, and followed.
self-sufficient kids learn to trust their own judgment.
how did the unsub get into Bobby's life?
and what's he trying to accomplish?
excuse me, ma'am. Mrs. Smith?
I know where your son is.
what? Where?
I can take you to him.
there's something strange about the body.
she was slaughtered by someone completely out of control, yet on her wrists there are precise wounds on top of where she already cut herself, only deeper.
like he was trying to replicate her suicide attempts but then lost control.
maybe this was never about the kid at all, but about the mother.
make her suffer for a few days by taking the child, then kill her?
it means he knew her personal history.
I'll call Garcia.
Hey, baby girl, whatever you're doing, drop it.
Oh, yes, and with pleasure.
let me tell you something, sweetheart.
this is a Lamborghini you are talking to. You have to drive me.
you can't just leave me parked in the garage collecting dust or I will wilt. Please forgive my neglect.
I need you to rev up that fine-tuned Italian engine of yours, then.
revving.
our unsub had personal details about Marlene Smith, so I need you to figure out who might have been in her house recently.
cable guy, plumber, people like that.
Yeah, I always wonder about plumbers.
you know they peek in your medicine cabinet.
you just know it.
maybe try a phone repairman or a babysitter.
check computers in the house.
maybe she used of of those techie fix-it type dweebs who makes house calls. Hey, watch it. Language.
you know I'm just playing with you, but come on, put a rush on it. Clock's ticking, ok?
rush is the only speed a Lamborghini has.
proud techie dweeb over and out. Beep beep ya.
agent Hotchner.
we had another child abduction.
a 4-year-old boy taken from a park about a half an hour ago.
just a couple miles from here.
morgan and Reid, head over there.
I was sitting on the bench, and he was playing right there.
I looked away for two seconds.
were you by yourself?
you told the police you live in McKinley Heights.
that's almost an hour away.
you drove your son all the way out here to play?
I was doing things.
shopping.
why are they looking here?
my son isn't here.
Mrs. Tanner, please don't take this the wrong way, but exactly what drug are you addicted to?
you're displaying symptoms of withdrawal.
are you crazy?
ma'am, we saw two dealers going down on the other side of the park when we arrived.
you were here to buy, weren't you? That's what had you distracted.
I can't believe that you actually think I would...
your child is missing, Ms. Tanner.
every minute, every half-minute counts.
you need to tell us the truth and you need to tell us now.
this will be your bed up here, Timmy.
bunk beds are cool. This'll be the boys only room.
look, I got you some new pajamas.
I want my mommy!
I want my mommy!
fine!
you want to be a baby? - I want my mommy!
you sit there and cry like a baby for your mommy!
I want my mommy.
mommy!
Yeah, Hotch, the mother's addicted to Oxy. She was out here to buy.
all right, let's put her in protective custody.
so we got one mom suicidal and the other one addicted to drugs.
at least we got a pattern developing. And if the unsub holds to pattern, he's gonna circle back and try to kill her.
I want my mommy! I shouldn't have gotten mad in there like that with Timmy.
let me out!
that was wrong.
but he's got a mommy like yours.
weak.
help! Mommy!
when can I go home?
this is your home now.
you'll be safe and happy here.
I want my mommy!
where is my mom?
I took your mom to a place where she'll be happier.
that's what you said you wanted.
no.
do you think wolves are bad?
people say they are, but they're not.
they kill other animals for a reason
to get rid of the sick and the weak. Let me out!
thin the herd. I want my mommy!
so the herd can be stronger. It's the way of nature.
and they--they even kill other wolves sometimes, when they're weak or sick.
but the nice thing is, wolves always take care of any cubs who don't have moms or dads.
let me out!
help!
when I was bringing Timothy over,
I asked him the same thing I asked you.
did he want me to make things better with his mommy?
and he said yes.
as little as he is, he said yes.
I want my mommy!
it's an instinct.
he knows.
here's a snack for you guys.
I just gotta go out for a little while.
we're looking for a male unsub in his mid- to late 20s, physically fit enough to subdue Marlene Smith and carry out a vicious and sustained attack.
we believe he sees himself as a rescuer, taking children away from unfit parents.
he may very well have abandonment issues from his own childhood.
the impulsive nature of committing the murder out in the open suggests that he's inexperienced.
the violence on Marlene Smith went from precision to frenzy, which points to someone with classic psychopathic traits, quick to rage and quick to recover.
he also appears to have insider knowledge of the families in these cases, so we need to look for someone who is privy to what went on behind those closed doors.
emergency personnel were called to the Smith house after both suicide attempts and once to the Tanner house after the mother overdosed on prescription drugs.
that means first responders, child service workers, ambulance personnel.
both missing children apparently went without struggle or protest.
that makes us think that they had prior contact with the person we're looking for.
or they inherently trust who he is by virtue of his job, the uniform he wears-- doctor, mailman, policeman.
so far the violence has been directed to the offending parent, but we don't know what the unsub's end game is.
we have written up a media release on precautions the public needs to take.
and we've taken the second mother into protective custody,
mommy! Thus depriving him of his target.
this will increase his volatility.
that's why it's critical we find these kids.
if they are alive, he may turn his violence against the children themselves. I want my mommy!
I want to go home!
I want my mommy!
I want my mommy! Don't hurt him!
thank God you found him. We got lucky.
whoever took him let him go. Is he ok?
your son was checked out by a pediatrician.
there was no sexual or physical abuse.
I can't believe my wife let this happen.
I need a drink.
did you see another little boy there?
his name was Bobby. Is he ok?
good.
were you in a dark place or did it have windows?
it was a house.
OK.
so when he took you, did you drive in the car for a long time or a short time? I don't know.
can you tell us what the man looked like?
I don't know.
when this man came to the park to get you, were you afraid?
no.
why not? He said he would come, on the phone.
the phone. You talked to him on the telephone?
he's a superhero.
can you show us?
911 operator. Please state your emergency.
911 operator.
911 operator. State your emergency.
you've gotta send somebody. He tried to attack me.
who did?
my mom's boyfriend.
what's your name? Shannon.
shannon Barton. How old are you?
13. Please, please send somebody.
he's drunk and my mom won't do anything about it.
are you still at 788 4th Avenue, apartment C?
Yes. Hurry.
help is on the way, Shannon.
Garcia, any progress with the 911 dispatcher?
I'm going as fast as I can, which is super fast.
there are literally hundreds in the great St. Louis area.
can you help me narrow this down?
refine your search to males between 25 and 30 years of age.
and our unsub probably has abandonment issues, so look for backgrounds that reflect that.
a history of foster care or someone who was farmed out to other relatives by his own parents.
can you trace individual 911 dispatchers based on calls they would have received?
OK, look, let me make this clear.
there are a quarter of a billion 911 calls annually.
that's like 10 calls every second of every day.
and non-emergent calls are disposed of quickly.
well, this operator would have been on duty when both calls came in from the Smith and Tanner families.
and he would have been off duty at the times of the two abductions and Marlene Smith's murder.
Oh, my God. This brings needle in a haystack to a whole other dimension, but I will go to that dimension and I will cross-reference and I will call you back.
a mother who wants to kill herself.
what does that say to a child?
that you're not worth sticking around for?
a 911 operator would be why the kids trusted him.
the unsub must have gone back to the house to do some sort of follow-up on his own and they remembered his face.
did you hear me?
Oh. Sorry.
Uh...Morgan and I were joking around on the jet, but something is definitely up.
is there anything you want to share?
it's nothing that...
I had breakfast with Carolyn the other morning.
Oh! Is that wife number 4 or 5?
look, let's get our facts straight.
I only had 3 wives.
I mean, that's within the realm of reasonable.
OK. I'm sorry. Which one was Carolyn?
numero uno.
use your words, Emily.
uh...there's always something about the first, in anything.
I don't know, I might be way off here, but I think she's putting some feelers out to see if that old spark is still there.
is it?
I'm having her over to my house for dinner when I get back.
I'm crazy, right?
we don't always get second chances in life, Rossi.
I say take the plunge, see where it goes.
come with me, sir.
don't take him, don't take him. He didn't do anything.
he said he didn't do anything.
she--she makes stuff up. Shannon, tell them you made a mistake.
uh, I'll take my own car.
come on, let's go. Don't touch me.
why did you call the police? He said he didn't do anything.
he came into my bedroom and grabbed me. Honey, he was in there for another reason.
he has me. Why... I hate you!
talk to me, mama.
first off, you are on restriction from my inner Lamborghini.
I mean it. This high-performance engine may purr like a puma on the prowl, but this time, Derek, you have seriously overheated my engines and I will require some cool-down laps upon your return, if you know what I mean by that. Baby girl, you're on speaker.
I knew that.
I'm calling to tell you, sir, there are 11 911 dispatchers in the greater St. Louis area that were on duty when the calls were placed but not working during the murder and abduction.
of those 11, there's one that fits your profile
george Kelling, age 27, 1181 Clay Street, apartment 8. Sending his picture right now.
do you know where he is now? He was scheduled to work today. His supervisor said he showed up for his shift, but then he left early.
can you get the log of all the calls he took tonight?
Yeah, of course. But there are a lot. Skip to the last one.
last one is a domestic disturbance at 788 4th Avenue, number C.
attempted sexual assault of a young girl. Kelling dispatched the police and then he took off.
let's go.
don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you.
you're not my boss.
you know what? Just go be with your boyfriend.
the police said you had to come to the station, so go get your stuff so we can go. Now!
what do you want?
I'm here to do some follow-up, make sure everything's ok.
everything's fine. We just need to be left alone right now.
everything's not fine, Mrs. Barton.
mom! Oh, my God.
clear!
it's clear.
the door's open and the lights are on. The unsub beat us here. What have you got?
nothing. The place is empty. If the unsub's keeping the kids, he's holding them someplace else.
you need to get away.
I know you.
you're the kid on the news that was kidnapped.
who hurt you?
who is he? What does he want?
I know this is a lot to absorb right now.
Where's my mom? I'm helping you.
you called for help.
the police already came. They took him away.
Shannon, the problem isn't the boyfriend.
there'll be another boyfriend after him and another after that.
the problem is your mother.
what have you got, Garcia?
sir, you said to check backgrounds.
at 10 years of age, George Kelling entered the foster care system and I don't know why.
his father abandoned the family when he was a baby.
I can't figure out what happened to mom yet.
all right, we need the address of the foster family he was placed with.
Yeah, yeah, I know. He bounced around a lot.
give me a second. I'll call you back. Ok.
OK, what I don't understand is why would he keep Bobby but release Timothy?
if he wants to get rid of the parent, why not kill them first and then take the child. It's so much riskier to wait.
unless the children are a crucial part of his killing ritual.
how?
he needs something from them before he can murder the parents.
what could they possibly give him?
their approval.
that's what he wants her to say.
my daughter will never tell him to get rid of me.
never.
we fight sometimes, but we love each other.
she's my whole world. She means so much to me.
he'll hurt her if she doesn't, because that means she's weak, too.
deja vu all over again.
so, get this.
george Kelling's mom committed suicide when he was 10. She jumped off a bridge.
before that, the attempted to kill herself multiple times, cutting her wrists. This sounds really familiar, huh?
did you find the foster home address? Those records are still sealed.
I got my crowbar out, I'm working on it.
you're crazy.
I'm going to tell you something.
I've never told anyone before, Shannon.
nobody.
my mother, she was troubled, too.
she either stayed in bed crying or she went on long walks.
I never knew where she went on those walks.
then one day I decided to follow her.
she didn't know I was there.
at first it just... seemed like she was wandering.
but then I saw where she was going.
it was a bridge.
she climbed up onto the ledge and sat there looking down.
it seemed like she was there for hours.
my mother, she wanted to die.
but it was like...
it was like she couldn't make herself do it.
and then it happened.
she was gone.
for that moment,
I don't think I ever saw her more content.
it was like a kind of peacefulness.
finally, she was free.
as bad as it seemed, my mother was right to kill herself.
from one moment to the next...
her pain ended...
and my life changed.
now...
now it's your moment, Shannon.
the foster family lived on a farm 10 miles northwest of the city on Parkhill Road.
the rest of the team is gonna meet us there.
hurry.
no, no. I didn't mean it!
don't hurt him. Don't hurt him!
let go of me!
stop! It was me! Let me out!
why are you doing this? What did we do?
shut up! Just shut up!
so what happened to the foster parents? The father died years ago.
the mother just died last month--heart attack.
that must have been the trigger. The last person who rescued the unsub was gone.
he assumed the mantle.
and now he suddenly has a house to take these kids to.
wait. Garcia said the mother jumped off of a bridge, right?
Yeah. Why? What are you thinking?
suicidology is an imperfect science, but it's uncommon for women to kill themselves so violently.
for lack of a better word, they tend to choose more feminine ways to die.
men shoot themselves, jump off of buildings onto pavement.
women are less messy.
they take pills and drown themselves.
and now it's your turn to do the right thing.
I know you will.
this is about making a decision, Shannon.
your mother has caused nothing but pain.
one word from you now and this will all end.
I love my mom.
that's crap. What?
if you loved me, you never would have called 911.
we're here now because of you.
because you were jealous, jealous that I had a man in my life.
he was gonna rape me. According to you.
he came into my room, he grabbed my blouse and pushed me onto the bed.
well, you shouldn't have been dressing like that in the first place.
it was like you were telling him that you wanted him to do something.
why are you saying these things?
you want to know the truth?
I told Gary he could have you.
he was gonna leave me.
you didn't tell him that. You couldn't.
Reid and JJ and I will take the front.
the rest of you take the perimeter.
it's time to end this, Shannon.
do you agree?
I think she's made her decision.
FBI. Put the gun down.
drop the gun. Do it. You have to let me finish.
nobody else can do it. Nobody's strong enough.
like you were strong with your mother? Don't talk about her.
she was weak. She killed herself and left me alone.
I don't think so.
because she tried to kill herself before, nobody would question it.
but you did it. You pushed her off the bridge.
you killed her.
no. I helped her!
the boy's in the closet!
we need medical. He's down in a back bedroom.
let me go! They need me!
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to say those things. He was gonna kill you.
I know. I know, Mom.
all things truly wicked start from an innocence. Ernest Hemingway.
we got all the kids back safe.
think about it, Aaron. How often does that happen?
not often enough. How about 10 pairs of shoes?
I mean, that has to be enough, right? 10?
Ah, Spence, it's different with the ladies.
we need them to match our belts, our handbags, our skirts, and the fashions change with the seasons.
Yes. Boys are so boring. Pants, shoes, out the door.
although it's not like men don't have their things.
I dated a golfer once.
he had 12 putters in his closet.
but this conversation is reminding me I need new boots.
they're having a sale at DeMille's on those tall-shaft kitty heels.
you like those. Do you want to go?- Yeah.
you getting all this, kid?
no.
sure you don't need any help?
done. Sit down, relax.
the cioppino was delicious.
you gotta love any dish that recommends the wearing of a bib.
Yeah.
top me off, would you?
you know, I don't remember you as being a big wine drinker.
well, I'm not.
I guess I just need a little fortification tonight.
when did you ever need that with me?
you know, who would have thought that we'd find ourselves on a date again after all these years?
do you remember during our divorce the pledge we made to one another?
that no matter what, we'd always be there for the other one.
future spouses and significant others would just have to understand.
we joked we were the only couple that had both marriage and divorce vows.
Hey, what's going on with you?
you know, I...
I don't know how to say this, except--except to just say it.
last year I was diagnosed with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease.
look, like you always said, nobody lives forever.
why didn't you call me earlier? I could have...
please-- please let me finish.
because if I don't get this out now,
I don't know that I ever will.
I've had this disease for over a year.
to live 18 months is a gift.
the last few weeks I've started noticing the signs.
it won't be long now.
I came to ask you...
when the disease reaches the point and I'm too weak or too afraid...
I--I want you to help me leave this world on my own terms.
when it's time, will you help me end my life?
Tucker, no.
no...
don't.
Tucker, no.
no.
get out!
it's coming, man, it's coming!
it's beautiful, isn't it?
the wrath of god himself!
just wait, man!
I finally got him down.
he still feel warm?
uh, the ibuprofen must have kicked in.
Ah, it's that preschool.
place is like a petri dish.
I thought you had a few days off.
what's the case?
it's about some missing kids.
I guess you gotta go in, then, huh?
please don't walk away like that.
we've talked about this.
I know this is hard on you.
Henry, too.
on all of us.
look, if I had someone to cover my shifts, I would.
what if it was Henry?
don't. It's not Henry. Henry's right in there.
what if it was?
you'd want someone out there looking for him.
no, I know. You're right. It's just...
things worked better when you were at the pentagon.
I wasn't helping anyone there, Will.
you worked normal hours and weekends off.
fine. I'll tell them I can't come in.
don't do that.
I was supposed to have time off.
Henry's not feeling well.
it's all right.
you should go. I'll take care of it.
really, I got this.
I'll see you when you get back.
you don't have to be here.
Ah, I get antsy when I'm gone too long.
and thanks for the team's donation to ALS in Carolyn's name.
she would have appreciated it.
so how are you doing?
I'm ok.
it's funny, though.
we were divorced 20 years.
and I never missed her as much as I do right now.
Hey, you.
welcome back.
good to be back, Penelope.
we're ready when you are, sir.
the bodies of two unidentified boys were found near Wichita, Kansas, a week apart.
both were caucasian and between the ages of 15 and 17.
they were each found mangled in the aftermath of a tornado.
Yeah, but that's not what did them in.
the M. E. has determined that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head before the storms hit.
well, the death blow in each case was in almost exactly the same spot.
now, what about all the other damage to their bodies?
some of their limbs are missing.
Yeah, victim number one, his right leg was taken off.
victim number 2, both arms were severed.
but was that because of the tornado or the unsub?
the M. E. still hasn't discovered that.
he's a busy guy.
major storms have hit the area.
23 dead. The morgue is slammed.
it fits the unsub. He's got a hell of a sadistic streak.
well, a tornado would clear the air and give the unsub the privacy to do his thing.
he may be using the storm as the body disposition modality.
forensic countermeasure, wind, hail, rain, mother nature destroys the crime scene.
or he wants us to think mother nature actually committed the murders.
what concerns me is the brief period between kills.
only a week. He's moving fast.
we need to move faster. Garcia, get me I. D.s on all the victims.
I'm a gale-force wind.
wheels up in 30.
Oh, and pack for foul weather. The forecast is nasty.
the national weather service has issued a tornado warning for Sedgwick County, Kansas, at 9 p. m. Meteorologists...
Yeah, we're back! Told you!
you owe me 5 bucks.
better pay up this time.
for the man sound of body and serene of mind, "there is no such thing as bad weather."
every day has its beauty. "And storms which whip the blood do but make it pulse more vigorously." George Gissing.
central plains.
right in the middle of tornado alley.
if this unsub is using tornadoes as a forensic countermeasure, then Kansas certainly is the ideal setting.
tornadoes do pose a significant threat.
during this year's super outbreak back in April, there were 336 confirmed tornadoes in just several days, resulting in over 300 lives lost.
tell us something good, mama.
OK, so local P. D. have I. D.'d your victims.
I'm putting this all on your tablets if you'd like to follow along.
first up is Jason Meredith, 16-year-old runaway from Garden City, Kansas.
mom said he took off over a year ago.
next up is Eric Janelle, 15-year-old foster kid from Wichita.
he's been gone 3 weeks.
Oh, both of these kids have records for possession and prostitution.
they were street hustlers.
at-risk kids. This could be a sexual predator.
an extremely violent one if the unsub is responsible for the damage done to the bodies, especially those missing limbs.
well, now, he could be keeping the body parts for some sort of fetish.
Oh, ok, eew. That is my cue.
I'm here if you need me with my binary machines that don't say gross things.
I didn't know you were a bad flyer.
I'm not. I just hate turbulence.
you know, turbulence very rarely causes planes to crash.
that does me absolutely no good at the moment.
thank you.
what we really need to worry about are microbursts, sudden downbursts of air associated with thunderstorms.
but a small craft like this, if we hit one of those at the wrong altitude - Pulverized.
I beg of you to make him stop.
a tornado outside Wichita killed 2 and injured 9 last night.
the twister, which classified as an F2 on the fujita scale, is the latest in a freak series of storms to hit late in the season.
more harsh weather is expected as officials prepare for the worst.
the guy was torn up pretty bad.
thought we'd find his arms, but we never did.
found him right over there.
well, the unsub definitely has his own mode of transportation.
this is way off the beaten path.
and the first victim, Jason Meredith, was found over 30 miles away.
you say you were able to clear this place before the storm hit?
I didn't know you could do that for tornadoes.
when we get enough lead time, we try to clear all the mobile home parks.
the last place you want to be in a twister is in a trailer.
we close of the main roads, too.
OK, so the unsub either found a way in or he was already here and he hid during the evacuation.
that, or the body got sucked up into the funnel cloud and was thrown here from someplace else.
either way, he came into close contact with this storm.
maybe even close enough to put himself in danger.
or he waited someplace safe for it to pass and came back and dumped the body.
no, I think the storm itself actually means something to this guy.
you don't think he's just using it to cover his tracks?
I played ball in college with a guy from Indiana.
he said he and his boys used to get drunk and then chase storms.
said it was the closest they could get to the true power of god.
I saw an F3 when I was in high school.
he wasn't kidding.
OK, so he's impulsive, probably young, maybe a loner with nothing to lose.
we should be looking at actual storm-chasers.
where can we find them?
they mostly work with the university.
you think this guy's educated.
well, he knows enough about the weather to use it to his advantage.
so far it's working.
here you go.
when was the last time you saw Jason?
the day he ran away.
a little over a year ago.
he came and he hugged me just like he always did before he went to school.
do you know why he would leave home?
his father, Ray.
he used to beat on me.
on Jason, too.
and how did Jason cope with that?
he'd always try to protect me.
even when he was a little guy, he always really fought back.
sometimes if, afterwards, if I was crying, he'd just come and he'd sit there and hold my hand.
so it sounds like you and Eric were pretty good friends.
those other kids aren't too cool at that house.
your foster mom said that you used to get in a lot of fights before Eric got there.
that's my boy.
nobody messes with me 'cause nobody messes with him.
so he looks out for you.
Yeah, we look out for each other.
when was the last time you saw him?
about 3 weeks ago.
he said he was running to the store and never came back.
he in some kind of trouble or something?
we found him a couple of days ago.
he took the news about Eric pretty well.
tough kid.
I guess they have to be. They're all alone.
each of the victims had a strong protective instinct and was looking out for somebody else besides themselves.
maybe the unsub is keying in on that.
boys like that are hard to fool.
what if he used to be one of them?
I mean, those kids would see right though someone trying to be a poseur.
if his M. O. is connected to the weather, he's gonna try to grab another boy soon.
there's a major system expected tonight.
what's up, guys?
where can I get some beers?
quickie mart.
take a right on main.
sorry, man. I'm not from around here.
Where's main?
about 4 blocks that way.
Thanks.
Hey, uh, any of you guys want to party?
got some tuss.
a little weed, too.
how about you?
come here, buddy boy. It's all good.
he's too young.
it's 100.
I got 50.
and I'll thrown in a couple of sixers for you and your boys.
come on, man.
let's get in. Let's go have some fun.
every slab in the house is full. Could you hold that?
we have two weeks over.
can't apologize enough for the delay.
4 years of med school, most of the time it's old folks, heart attacks, and strokes.
now, I'm from new york.
not a whole lot of action out here in Wichita.
your guys are right here.
identical blows to the head.
well, that's what tipped me off, not to mention they're both John Does.
kids this age get claimed fast.
they had alcohol and dextromethorphan in their systems?
it's cough medicine.
Yeah. You see it with a lot of kids.
it's a cheap high, free if you can steal it.
and these two had a whole lot of it on board.
what were you able to determine from all the damage to the bodies?
well, it's mostly consistent with tornado casualties I've seen before.
lacerations, abrasions, massive internal trauma.
mostly?
well, their limbs.
those are chopped off. I'm guessing with an axe or a cleaver.
Yeah, a dull one by the looks of the tissue damage at the stumps.
cut off postmortem.
Oh, definitely, but only minutes after they were killed.
you see the discoloration?
the decomposition begins almost as soon as the blood supply stops.
they both have ligature marks on their wrists and ankles, at least what they have left of them.
good eye. Those are all actually antemortem.
they're from restraints.
he held them before the kill.
was there any sign of sexual assault?
inconclusive.
all the damage made it impossible to tell.
so, he gets them drunk and high, he restrains them, kills them, a cleaves off a limb as a souvenir.
then he dumps the body and lets the storm clean up his mess.
but why the souvenir?
what or who, exactly, is he trying to remember?
the national weather service has issued a tornado warning for Butler County, Kansas.
a large, violent storm moving west at 40 miles per hour.
OK, time to go.
...this large and destructive tornado.
take cover immediately.
this is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation.
come on, let's go!
knock it off!
we gotta go!
don't worry, buddy boy.
I'd never forget you.
double or nothing I find us another one?
what, you scared to lose again?
all right, then, gentleman's bet.
that's my boy.
never seen anything like it.
name's Gary Dyson.
16
runaway from Kansas City.
a couple of my guys have seen him before.
I. D.'d him off the tattoos on what's left of his arms.
this particular area get hit with a tornado last night?
thunderstorms came through.
warnings went out, but no twisters.
the weather's gotta be the trigger.
he's following the patterns.
we track the storms, we find the unsub.
forensic evidence has been washed away.
but behaviorally, it's the most intact crime scene we've encountered so far.
it's the same blow to the head, but no cuts, no abrasions.
except he's missing his torso.
it was only a matter of time before he missed one.
tornadoes are extremely unpredictable and sometimes last only a matter of minutes before they dissipate.
the fact that he was able to leave his previous victims directly in the path of one is astounding.
so the conditions were perfect last night, but his tornado never came.
it's only been 4 days. He's accelerating.
and the weather's driving him to do it.
guys, we know that fetishists are loyal to the body parts they take, but I think that this unsub is loyal to the whole of these parts.
you could almost assemble an entire body.
so he's not taking bodies apart, he's putting one together.
we're looking for a white male in his mid- to late-20s.
he's mobile and he travels great distances to follow storms.
he's probably in a truck or a van.
we believe he may live in that vehicle.
it's probably beat up, maybe rusted from the elements.
sorry.
jeffrey Dahmer, serial killer, was under the delusion that he could create young male sex zombies that wouldn't resist his advances.
and when Dahmer's test subjects died, he kept their body parts as souvenirs.
skulls, hearts, even genitalia.
restoring body parts is no small task.
they're gonna get ripe fast.
he needs lots of ice, salt, maybe, something to preserve them.
and he's paying for all that stuff somehow.
gas, too.
he doesn't have the social skills to hold a job for long, so he's most likely a day laborer, handyman, anything transitory.
we think he's using the weather as a forensic countermeasure to destroy evidence, but we also think he might be some sort of symphoraphiliac.
sorry, symphora what?
uh, excuse me.
Symphoraphiliacs - They're sexually aroused by disaster.
usually fires or traffic accidents.
in this case, the weather must enhance his excitement.
he hunts street kids, so he may be from a similar background.
and he's most likely uneducated, but he's still charming enough to engage his victims.
we'll talk to the press.
you should warn any transient kids you might know.
as this weather gets worse, so will the unsub.
all right.
let's get to it.
since when is a seizure fine?
the doctor said it's normal for kids his age.
but his fever broke.
Yeah.
it's back again.
did you give him his medicine this morning?
no. He was ok.
did he feel warm? - No.
well, you checked, right?
JJ, of course I did.
what are you trying to say?
nothing. I...
where is he now?
he's resting.
I'm just waiting for some paperwork and then we're gonna go home.
OK. I'll call you when my flight arrives.
you don't have to do that.
Henry's sick.
I'm coming home.
call you later.
what's wrong?
uh, it's Henry.
he had a febrile seizure.
will took him to the E. R. He-he's fine.
apparently it's totally normal.
look, I gotta get back home.
of course.
anything I can do?
can I borrow the jet?
I think the budget oversight committee might not appreciate my generosity.
Yeah, well, worth a shot, right?
check in and let us know everything's all right.
Thanks. - Ok.
Hey, Hotch.
I've been thinking - The vast majority of unsubs with this type of M. O.
aren't driven by the killing.
they're really fascinated by the body parts.
psychologically they exist in a realm where fantasy meets delusion.
it's basically the perfect blueprint for the creation of a serial killer.
I'm rambling, aren't I? - Yes.
should probably get to the point.
I think I know how this unsub may have gotten started.
all right, the first victim was found missing his right leg, the second, both arms, and the third had no torso.
so that leaves the left leg and the head unaccounted for.
we can assume the head would be the most difficult piece to find.
that part would have to fit an unsub's fantasy perfectly.
so he'd most likely save it for last.
now, what that tells us is there's a victim out there we haven't found yet who's missing his left leg.
or the unsub hasn't acquired it yet.
true, but most body part collectors evolve to this level, and in many cases they exhumes bodies for parts before they start killing.
all right, let me call Garcia.
so you think our unsub did the same thing.
P. G. At your service, don't let the name fool you.
baby girl, you're on speaker.
Garcia, can you look for grave robberies in tornado alley over the last 5 years?
okey-dokey.
searching.
that's a shockingly big list.
who knew grave-robbing was so on trend?
how many of those involve the bodies of teenage boys?
uh... None.
what about morgues and funeral homes?
Momentito...
again, that is a list that should not be that big.
mostly stolen embalming fluid, though.
it's often used like pcp, Garcia.
I'm feeling optimistic about the youth of America.
there are no teenagers involved in this either.
all right, try looking for thefts involving body parts, specifically left legs.
OK, eew!
see, this is why I can't talk about how my day was at dinner.
breakfast, lunch.
Spencer, you scare me.
join the club.
a left leg was stolen off a body a year ago at the Riggio funeral home in Tulsa.
they never found who did it.
Garcia, what was the weather like in the area at the time?
uh, thunderstorms and tornadoes.
an F2 cyclone hit right around there, and then the robbery took place after they evacuated.
it's gotta be our unsub.
wait, there's more.
the guy whose leg was stolen, he was a 47-year-old father of 2 who died of leukemia.
that's a huge jump.
preferential child sex offenders don't usually stray from their preferred age range.
it's not about the sex at all.
he used the body from the funeral home to develop his M. O.
so he could live out his fantasy and kill in a storm.
it still doesn't explain what or who he's building.
whatever it is, this unsub won't stop until he finds a perfect head.
that's the final piece to his puzzle.
what's up, guys?
do you need a ride or something?
uh, no, man, we're good. Thanks.
you sure?
it's kind of wet out here.
Yeah, yeah, we're good.
come on, man. It's raining buckets.
get off me.
Hey, man, it's cool.
it's cool.
come on.
fellas, I was wondering, can you tell me the best way to get to I-135?
Yeah, it's back that way.
Thanks. Appreciate it.
I'm from Oklahoma.
I don't get up here much.
so there's nothing?
um, ok, what about out of Kansas City?
no. No.
OK, thanks.
thought you were out of here.
flights are canceled 'cause of the weather.
how's Henry?
he's headed home.
finally released him.
that's great news.
where are you guys off to?
to the university to talk to some storm chasers.
stay dry.
Yeah, right.
who's that with Hotch?
there's been another abduction.
a boy named Shaun Rutledge. That's his younger brother Billy.
he says a young white guy in an rv attacked him with a crowbar in the rain.
he's also changed his victim selection criteria.
the boy he grabbed gets straight As, plays football, even volunteers at his church.
so he wanted him so badly, he was willing to leave a witness?
which suggests he's losing touch with reality and his delusions are starting to take over.
what is it about this kid that was so attractive to him?
he was teenage and caucasian like the others, right?
we also think that a sexual element may actually not be at play.
so then what the hell is driving this guy?
maybe it's love.
what if he's trying to recreate someone he loves?
it is an emotion that drives us to extremes.
if he's trying to recreate someone, it's probably somebody he loved and lost.
wait. You said he was with his big brother, right?
holla at your girl.
baby girl, I need those great big beautiful brains of yours.
jazz hands ready. Gimme.
OK, look at all the teenage male victims or tornadoes in the last 10 years.
same geography as before.
that would be male, 13 to 18-42.
how many victims had younger brothers that survived?
Uh...10.
the unsub might have been a high-risk kid.
Garcia, how many of the survivors have criminal records?
I got two for you.
first up is 27-year-old Justin Harris, had a DUI in 2008.
next is 22-year-old Travis James.
Ooh, little troublemaker.
shoplifting, possession, and prostitution.
Oh, my.
and all when he was a minor.
you got a home address or a vehicle registered in his name?
none.
you got a photo on this guy?
it's on your tablet right now.
all right, this is a composite sketch from the description the kid gave.
I don't know why you put up such a fight.
we're gonna be brothers, man.
me and you, against the world.
old school.
there. There.
Oh, my god. This poor kid.
in 2001, Travis James lost his big brother tucker and his mom Jan when a tornado hit the Mccleary Trailer Park in Enid, Oklahoma.
that's just south of here.
so our guy's a local.
everybody just sit tight. Oh, that's great. It's gonna kick in.
hang on, Garcia. The power just went out.
Garcia, I think we're good.
keep going.
sometime before this evil tornado touched down, Travis, along with 5 other boys, testified against a one Roscoe Gulch.
for what?
it appears that this Gulch character was a notorious pedophile in the area, and he was a resident of the same Trailer Park as Travis and his family.
I'm looking at police reports now.
it looks like brother Tucker had confronted this Gulch person lots of times.
he even broke the creep's nose once.
he was protecting his little brother.
and then the plot thickens.
according to a statement from Travis, right after Gulch was acquitted, he and his brother went to Gulch's mobile home.
it's gonna be ok.
a fight ensued.
Travis said it was like his big brother went crazy.
he was upset about the acquittal and dealt some justice of his own.
Travis said he heard tornado sirens.
it's a tornado! Get out of here!
Tucker, look out!
he then ran to a drainage pipe nearby.
after that, Tucker and Gulch somehow got trapped in the mobile home when the twister hit.
Travis said he saw the mobile home get swallowed up by the tornado.
and when he came out there was nothing left.
Garcia, how old was tucker when he was killed?
17. He was found in pieces.
it took his DNA and dental records to I. D. him.
Travis went into foster care and he was reported missing in 2003.
he ran away.
10 years ago his brother got ripped apart, and now he's trying to put him back together?
but why start killing now?
Garcia, send me current weather reports for the area, including radar images if you have them.
ask and you shall receive.
it is on your tablets.
with the weather in the area, he's going to be so excited, he won't wait.
he'll take the boy to the closest area with the most activity.
that's right around here, just southeast of us.
it's frankenstein.
what?
the unsub isn't just trying to put his brother back together, he's trying to bring him back from the dead.
he believes that tornadoes have the power to take life, so conversely, they should have the power to restore it.
we'll pick up Rossi and Prentiss on the way.
let's go.
damn it!
damn. I need a beer.
you want one?
ahh, nothing like a cold one to take the edge off, right?
you sure you don't want one?
it might make you feel better.
Garcia, what have you got?
sir, I found your trigger.
a year ago, a tornado ripped through a cemetery near Tulsa.
one of the 53 graves that was disturbed was that of Tucker James.
his brother was killed by a storm, then his memorial was destroyed by one.
now he's using both to build a memorial of his own.
now that he has that boy's head, the delusion will completely to take over.
Garcia, those storm chasers at the university we talked to, they should be out in full force.
I'm sending you their number now.
tell them to be on the lookout for the unsub's rv.
and, Garcia, patch into their radio chatter. They'll know where the storms are.
on it, my pretties.
come on, get it together.
we're gonna have fun, bro.
like before.
remember that time we stole mama's bourbon?
rode our bikes, what, 10 miles to go see them girls?
God, what were their names?
you thought you were gonna get laid.
and that chick.
puked herself so bad, I thought I'd die.
do you remember that?
it's gonna be all right.
we're gonna do this thing tonight.
why do you keep fighting, you dumb son of a bitch?!
you know what?
here, I'll show you.
the national weather service has issued a tornado warning for Sedgwick County in Kansas at 9 p. m.
central daylight time... - Ok, man!
here we go! What'd I tell you?
we need to head into those areas with the most precipitation.
so make a right at the next intersection. It should be Pawnee Road.
Hey, how exactly are we supposed to chase this storm?
the unsub won't actually chase the storm.
to get close to it, you have to get in front of it.
it's a little like playing chicken.
what?
it's frozen.
Hey, Hotch.
we just lost the internet.
I'm frozen up, too.
the weather must be affecting the upload.
I'm patching Garcia in.
Yes, boss.
Garcia, we just lost our internet and we need you to guide us into the storm.
consider me your eyes and ears, sir.
Oh, yeah, it's a beauty.
it looks like a landspout.
great funnel on that one. She's heading north.
OK, guys, a twister has been spotted near Rose Hill just south of your position.
the storm-chaser dudes are calling it a landspout.
we don't want that one. Landspout tornados are relatively insignificant.
where to, then?
Garcia, look for hook echoes on your monitor.
Hey, hook echoes.
Yeah. Ok, I'm gonna do that.
just tell me what they are.
they're swirling hook-like radar signatures that look surprisingly like what you'd expect them to.
OK. Uh... No, I don't see anything like that.
they'll likely form in those red and violet areas on the map.
I don't see anything that looks even remotely like that.
OK, they shouldn't be too far from our current position.
he's close.
Oh, god.
no, wait, wait, yes! Yes, I see it. Oh, that's gotta be it. Yes, ye...
where, Garcia?
Oh, no, no.
what? What is it?
there are two.
we'll have to split up.
which way, Garcia?
uh, ok.
half of you can stay in your current heading.
the other half, make a...
right on Meadowlark Road.
Morgan, take Meadowlark Road. We'll keep going.
got it.
Hey, I just got a hit from the storm-chaser dudes on the rv.
you guys are the closest.
where are we talking, Garcia?
heading east on Sumner Road just north of your position, make a left on prairie creek.
it's the next left.
you got it.
hang on, guys.
it's gonna come right through here.
I know it.
just wait, man.
I'm coming, buddy boy. I'm coming.
what are you doing?!
it's almost time!
you gotta stay still, dude.
trust me, it's all good.
we aren't got time for this.
it's coming now!
you want the hard way or the easy way?
what's that up there?
near the old house.
No! Who are they?
put the weapon down!
you get back!
we can't do that, Travis.
I said get back!
are you hard of hearing or something?
just let Shaun go and we can work this out.
that's his name, you know.
he has a little brother, too.
we know you saw them when you attacked them.
just go!
get out of here, please!
Travis, Tucker would not want this.
he would want to protect you like he did with Roscoe Gulch.
that bastard was guilty!
just let him go and we can help you.
we don't need your help!
I'm telling you, we need to get to cover now!
come on, man, put the weapon down!
put it down!
we gotta go! Gotta go!
me and you, man!
here we go!
"adversity is like a strong wind.
it tears from us all but the things that cannot be torn, so that we see ourselves as we really are." Arthur Golden.
so the weather's supposed to break tomorrow.
I should be home sometime in the afternoon.
I'll call and let you know for sure.
did you at least catch the guy?
Yeah. Sort of.
it's kind of weird.
you all right?
I'm-I'm fine.
it's just...
been a really long day.
listen, I'm really sorry about everything.
Yeah, me, too.
so, uh, is he still up?
Yeah, he said he's not going to sleep till you read his story to him.
headstrong little guy.
he's exhausted.
hang on.
Hey, buddy.
guess who's on the phone.
mommy!
Hi, little man. How-how are you?
I heard you, um, you went to the doctor.
are you coming home, mommy?
not yet, buddy.
tomorrow. I promise.
so, are you ready for story time?
Yeah! - Yeah?
OK. Daddy, are you ready?
bedtime for baby star. Once there was a baby star, he lived up near the sun.
and every night at bedtime, that baby star wanted to have some fun.
he would shine and shine and fall and shoot and twinkle, oh, so bright, and he said, "mommy, I'll run away if you make me say good night."
and then his mommy kissed him on his sparkly nose and said...
"no matter where you go, no matter where you are, no matter how big you grow, and even if you stray far...
I'll love you forever, 'cause you'll always be my baby star."
good night, mommy. - Good night.
everyone says that love happens when you least expect it.
I guess it's true, because when I met you, love was the last thing on my mind.
I'd find myself sneaking out to see you.
I'd put fancy makeup on just to make you smile.
I still feel the touch of your skin.
you help me get through every night.
you give my life purpose.
that's why no matter people try to do...
nothing is going keep us apart.
just the guy I'm looking for.
Hey, what's up, Kevin?
can we have...A talk?
is Penelope ok?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, she's perfect.
in fact, that's why I'm here.
I know you're Penelope's boo and she's your baby girl.
and what I'm about to embark on involves the keen insight of somebody who knows her inside and out.
and no matter how much therapy I've gone through trying to understand your relationship, I know you're that person.
OK, Kevin-- land your plane.
I want to propose to Penelope, and I need your help.
please, I'm not asking for your blessing,
I'm asking for your advice.
OK, should I do it over a couple tacos and a nice can of Red Bull?
all right. Should I take her to New York and do it at the Statue of Liberty?
maybe I should serenade her at the roundtable right before you guys present a case.
no, actually, that may not work, given the gruesome nature of your job.
Oh, how about the high tech room, and I pop up on the HD mainframe?
Kevin, seriously, I got a meeting I gotta get to.
Derek, please.
come on, bro, this is important.
um, hi, yeah, what was that about?
you know, he just wanted to talk.
about what?
just guy stuff.
me?
I didn't say that.
Garcia, I'd like to get started.
Yes, sorry.
uh, two couples were found shot, uh, to death in the Delridge neighborhood of Seattle, Washington.
the first was Mark Daniels and Ben Priestly.
they were found dead in their living room.
the second was John and Heather Miller.
they lived 4 miles away, and they were found last night dead in their home.
their daughter found them?
Yeah. She had snuck out to see her boyfriend.
when she got back, they were dead.
two double homicides must be rare in that area.
what makes it weirder is that there was no sign of robbery or sexual assault.
the shooter used a . 22. - Shot them execution style.
he's experienced to use a pillow as a silencer.
you don't want to wake the neighbors.
most executions are criminal enterprise related.
the probability of these couples being involved in the exact same illegal activity is kind of low.
there's no way these were random victims of opportunity.
Garcia, any sign of forced entry?
none that the authorities have found, no.
so it's a home invasion.
or our unsub is using some kind of ruse.
either way, they're calculating and dispassionate.
and no appreciation for chenille throw pillows.
the violent and targeted nature of these crimes suggests that there could be more.
wheels up in 30.
when people look back and talk about us, they're gonna say what I did was right.
that we were ahead of our time, we were pioneers.
I get to pick the movie next time.
well, it's better than the last 3D thing we saw at the IMAX.
come on, Gayle.
you look cute in those glasses.
am I any less cute when I have a migraine?
who are you? What do you want?
please don't hurt us.
there's money and jewelry upstairs.
and when they ask me why I did it... I'll tell them the truth.
it's because I love you...
I love you, Tommy Brown.
it was once said that love is giving someone the ability to destroy you but trusting them not to.
all right, let's go over victimology.
each of the victims is a professional.
the domestic partners were lawyers, and the Millers worked at a tech company.
but P. D. couldn't find any overlap.
both couples were really enjoyed by their peers, neighborhood watch, volunteered in community groups, you name it.
this was a straight-up execution.
kneeling on the ground, placing a pillow behind the head.
it seems ritualistic.
or they're simply taking precautions.
some of the vics were shot in the leg.
they probably were trying to defend themselves, and this was the only way our unsub could get them to the floor.
well, the scene's pretty clean, except what's left on the floor and the pillows.
Garcia, how are each of the couples' financials?
yo, I wish mine were this good.
what about the Millers' daughter Abby?
she sneaks out to see her boyfriend?
that's kind of convenient.
the P. D. confirms her story.
a neighbor saw her kissing her boyfriend in his backyard during the time of the kills.
you guys, something just happened.
another couple, the same area, shot to death in their house.
this is turning into a spree.
targeting potentially unrelated couples.
and the time between the murders is accelerating.
Prentiss, you and JJ go talk to Abby.
Dave and I will go to the first crime scene.
morgan and Reid, you go to the new one.
I mean, we get our occasional DWI, a few kids egging a house on Halloween.
but people shot like this...
it looks like one of those cable shows.
again, there's no sign of break-in.
but all the windows were unlocked, so who knows?
they got it right there.
they still had their keys out.
so they were caught off guard.
the house is childproofed.
it must have been a relative or a neighbor's kids.
they didn't have any children.
the unsub probably sat right here.
had a soda.
we should pull the cans for prints.
the reading light's still on, so the unsub was looking for something.
but there aren't any magazines or newspapers around, which means it was important enough to take him out of killing mode.
for someone on a spree, this unsub sure is patient.
if he's so patient, what is it that he's waiting for?
Hello?
do not put me on hold again.
all I need you to do is confirm an address for me, please.
miss?
you want to stand up for me?
want to stand up for me?
stand up. Get up.
let's get your jacket up.
I'm wet. - I know.
can I touch it?
I'd rather you didn't.
you're so lucky.
a child's the greatest gift of love anyone can ask for.
excuse me.
are you ok, sweetie?
I keep playing it over in my head.
maybe if I were at home, I... I would have heard something.
there's nothing you could have done.
they'd just finished watching TV.
listen, did your parents have any problems with anyone?
were there people who didn't like them?
no. Everyone loved them.
they'd have these...
get-togethers and there'd be, you know, a hundred people in the living room.
and where did they meet all of these people?
community groups? Clubs?
at church.
which one?
holy Worship?
they went twice a week and the wife taught Sunday school.
that's where Garcia said last night's victims went as well.
what about the first victims?
no. But they volunteered at a community center.
so we've got two couples from the same congregation killed.
that may be where they met the unsub.
and he turned on them.
I'll send Reid and Rossi to the church, see what they can find.
no.
no, mom, I didn't put it in too much light or overwater it.
listen, I gotta go.
well, don't call me an orchid killer.
I didn't kill it.
Bye.
excuse me.
Oh, my, what a pretty dress.
Oh, thanks.
I just got this.
I didn't know if it was too much for me, but who cares, right?
Yeah, who cares?
uh, what can I do for you?
the Millers and the Gilberts both participated in our foster program.
it's a local joint venture we have with the community center.
maybe it's the same one where our first victims volunteered.
well, I'm with Social Services and I was in the neighborhood, so I figured I'd come by.
I usually get a call ahead of time for that.
well, that explains why their homes were childproofed.
they sometimes had kids in their custody.
but if they were foster parents, it would have come up when Garcia checked their backgrounds.
Oh, if this is a problem, I'll just set up a time to see you later.
great. - I'll have to report denial of entry, of course.
Uh--no, just come on. It's fine.
what if you get a child who needs a home immediately but no foster families are available?
is there some sort of emergency list. Yeah. They could take the kids for just a night or a weekend.
and, uh, both couples were on that list, too.
we'll need a copy of that.
we also need the names of anyone who would have had access to it.
our unsub's following that list.
our last couple had a baby in their possession two days ago.
that sheds some light on the . 22. That gun is easy to handle.
and not very loud.
you know, add that to no forced entry, I don't think the pillows were used to minimize sound.
they were used to stay clean.
which means this unsub might be a woman.
who's most likely had a connection to the foster system.
or she simply wants a kid.
then why not just snatch one off the street?
this is maternal desire.
these couples took in babies.
maybe she lost her own or can't conceive.
so she probably killed those people because when she got to their home, they didn't have a child in their possession.
she'll keep killing until she finds one.
so when was Johnny last in your house?
uh...he was moved a couple days ago.
I almost cried.
you should have seen me.
where was he placed?
it should be in the file.
well, I don't have that information here.
I'm sure my social worker must have it.
what are you doing?
well, this is a gun, and inside of it are what we call bullets.
what do you want?
I want to know where Johnny is.
well, I just told you.
they put him in a home.
which home?
it's probably on the desk.
then hurry up.
where is it?
I don't see it. Where is it?
it's on the last page.
do you want me to call her for you?
no. I want you off your necklace.
my what? - Your necklace.
now take off your dress.
take it off!
please don't hurt me.
I've never hurt anybody in my life.
kneel on the ground.
I--I was raped once before.
Oh, for God sakes, shut up.
our father who art in heaven... - Stop that.
hallowed by thy name... - Stop that.
they kingdom come - , stop.
thy will be done... On earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, - as we forgive those who trespass against us. - Shut up!
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
that's enough!
she was on the emergency foster family list, too.
but she hadn't had the kid in 48 hours.
the unsub must have some kind of ruse.
she gets in pretty easily.
well, she's definitely an organized spree killer.
she changed her M. O.
she stripped the woman down to her underwear and took her clothes.
we'll check for sexual assault.
I wouldn't waste too much time.
female serial killers are agenda driven, not sexually compulsive.
what's the agenda here?
she left the woman in her heels and her slip.
it could be humiliation.
why didn't she do this to any of the others?
well, she's definitely escalating.
when she found out the woman didn't have a child, she got mad.
look at this. She gave up on the pillow, then sprayed the body with bullets.
so her maternal desire is causing her to unravel.
what started all this?
she's killing this frequently because she's desperate.
she may have told somebody that she's pregnant and now she's got to produce a kid.
Oh, come on.
is it Garcia? - Yep.
why aren't you answering it?
complicated.
Derek Morgan, this is the 67th message that I have left you, and if you do not call me back, I will have no choice but to show everyone that nude photo of you from art class, and not the good one, either.
I'm being serious.
what were you and Kevin talking about yesterday?
I'm freaking out here.
please, call me back. Bye.
Penelope? You ok?
Yes, ok. Yes, I am ok. I am fine.
are you sure? - No!
what were you and Morgan talking about?
when? - When?
yesterday.
uh...I don't remember.
that's funny, 'cause you guys never talk.
well, now, that-- that is untrue.
that's totally true.
morgan is my friend.
you are my friend.
you and Morgan are not friends.
it's complicated.
you know, we were just talking about guy stuff.
yeah? Like what?
um... We were talking about basketball.
morgan hates watching basketball.
he's a hockey fan.
Yes. Yes, yes. Yes, I know.
in fact, he was just telling me about how one of the first professional hockey leagues was started by black players in Nova Scotia in 1895.
I know.
who knew?
do you want to get some dinner?
no. Uh... We're about to deliver the profile and I have to stay here.
we believe the unsub we're looking for is a white female, who, based upon the organizational level of the crimes, is in her late 30s to early 40s.
we also believe that something in the last few days has triggered her to think that killing was the only way she was gonna be able to obtain a child.
consequently, the foster families that did not have a child in their care when she visited, became her victims.
because all of these families recently had children in their homes, we believe our unsub is motivated by maternal desire.
maternal desire is the profound emotional need to mother a baby.
this stems from either the tragic loss of her own child or the inability to have one at all.
this unsub may also fantasize that someone else's baby belongs to her, and this emotion feels beyond her control.
a woman who miscarries sometimes projects onto someone else's baby and then sets out to take that child.
this may cause our unsub to do something drastic.
like commit a Caesarean abduction or kidnap a random kid.
the speed at which the kills are occurring suggests that our unsub is frustrated and devolving.
this is causing her to go on a spree, which usually ends in a very high body count and suicide by cop.
so we should look at anyone who is pregnant and suffering from postpartum psychosis.
we also need to check those who worked for or had access to the local foster system.
thank you.
any questions?
OK, here we go.
there you are, my big guy.
get in the car or I will shoot you right here.
Oh, my God.
OK. Ok.
OK, now, start the car, Karen.
how do you know my name?
I know everything about you.
you're single, you made six figures last year.
decided to adopt a baby because everything in your life had worked out except for your broken ovaries.
what do you want?
Oh, you'll see.
this'll be over sooner than you think.
don't worry, it's ok. It's ok. Everything's gonna be all right.
Yeah. Drive, Karen.
so I checked the pregnant employees working with the foster program.
no indication of maternal desire or postpartum psychosis.
what about those who were fired or quit?
only two were pregnant, but they also had healthy children.
the rest didn't fit the profile.
OK, we need to warn other parents in the foster system.
the police department's already making phone calls.
this woman is erratic and unstable.
what about someone who was recently released from a mental institution?
that would explain taking the last victim's clothes.
when you enter a facility, they strip you of your identity.
and when you get out of an institution, the first thing you do is try to get your identity back.
I'll get Garcia.
please, whatever you want I will give you.
is he still drinking formula, or is he on to milk?
I have stocks, and I have money.
I wanted to breast-feed him, but they took him away.
you know what happens when a mommy can't get rid of her milk?
the pain is excruciating.
they give you this pill that dries you up.
that's the most unnatural thing in the whole world, little Johnny.
his name is Ben.
it's Johnny!
you changed it.
can he eat peanuts?
because his dad is highly allergic.
his dad?
who are you?
I'm his mother, and I'm here to take him back.
Hi, baby.
mommy's here.
Yeah.
pull over.
that fit that description that have been released in the last two weeks.
all right, check Oregon, Idaho, even Montana.
OK. There are 4 women that match the profile, and none of them are preggers.
another woman's been shot, 3 blocks from here.
she has a fairly limited comfort zone.
all right, Reid, work the list. I'll take Rossi and Prentiss with me.
since you couldn't go out to dinner, I thought I would bring dinner to you.
you never bring me dinner.
vegan Pad Thai, your favorite.
you had to go all the way to Adams Morgan to get me that.
I thought I would just do something special.
and you're sweating.
no, I'm not.
why are you acting so weird?
I'm not acting weird. You're acting weird.
I'm acting weird because you're-- I don't have time for this, ok?
I need to get to work.
OK, I'll just stand in the back.
No! No, I can't concentrate if you're here.
Well...Ok.
um, I'll put the food in the fridge, but maybe you have time to take a nibble on this?
this is a red velvet cupcake, and you only give them to me on special occasions.
we'll talk later.
bp's 90 over 60.
can she talk?
no, pressure's falling.
check the car. I'll go with her.
we'll put out an APB on our unsub.
she might be on foot.
it's ok, Johnny.
mommy's gonna take care of everything.
no, no, no, no.
we are. We're almost there, honey. Almost there. Promise.
that's the first time she shot someone in public.
she also didn't kill her.
maybe she panicked and ran off.
or she intentionally spared her because she had what she wanted--a kid.
Rossi, look at all this.
the baby mirror.
and the stains.
Yeah, that could be formula.
our unsub most likely transferred the child into her own car right here on the street.
so that means she fits in, but the question is, where did the carjacking happen?
well, she was coming from the doctor's office.
the kid was sick.
OK, but why leave the victim so close to the police station?
well, she might not have known.
she's erratic and probably on a schedule.
so her desperation outweighed rationale.
uh...what are you doing here?
I got out.
it wasn't supposed to happen for another 6 months.
who's this?
it's Johnny, honey.
our Johnny. - Yeah.
we're gonna be a family, honey.
no one can stop us now.
Hey, let me look at you.
did you buy this for me?
Yeah.
it took me a long time to find it.
we have to hurry.
where are we going?
we could just go upstairs.
my mom won't be home for hours.
no, we're getting out of town, Tommy.
what are you talking about?
we're leaving here.
is there anything else you're gonna need?
well, I--I can't just take off.
sure you can.
I've spent the last 4 days getting everything ready.
I got us a house that has a yard and a jacuzzi tub, just like that hotel we used to go to.
what about my mom?
your mom is the reason that we're in this position in the first place.
she sent me to jail, Tommy. Remember? She's sick!
remember what she said about me on the television?
she said I was a predator. Am I an animal, Tommy?
no. - No. Come on, baby.
I'm tired of writing letters.
we can't go back to sneaking around anymore. Ok?
OK.
ignore that.
Tommy, it's Julie!
who's Julie?
a friend.
are you doing her?
what?
what's that for?
no one is gonna come between us again, Tommy.
did you get anything from Karen?
she's in surgery for two more hours.
what about you?
we think the unsub carjacked Karen at a pediatrician's office two blocks from where she was shot.
witnesses said that a woman with blond hair, early 40s, was waiting on a bench for an hour around the same time Karen took her kid there.
we're working up a composite now.
dozens of women and their children were in and out of the building in the morning, but her only focus was Karen.
so it's not just about maternal desire.
it's about a specific child.
Karen was in the process of becoming the kid's adoptive mom.
the boy's name is Ben.
what if he's our unsub's baby?
then he was probably fostered by all of our victims.
do we know the birth parents' names?
sealed with the state.
time to unseal it.
Julie, what are you doing here?
I missed you at lunch today.
Yeah, I had band practice.
you know, I was thinking about taking up the flute.
Oh, cool. - Yeah.
maybe we could talk about this later.
Oh, listen.
everyone's going to this dance in a few weeks, and I was thinking maybe you and I could go together?
I'm not really into dances.
Oh, but it'll be fun.
look, I know you haven't dated anyone since the whole Ms. Hallman thing, but
I know I'm not as old as her or experienced, but I know what to do.
what's that?
uh, it was, uh-- I'm just watching TV.
was that a baby?
no--No, it's not a baby.
it-- Ms. Hallman.
I thought you were in jail.
let me give you a little lesson on the prison system, sweetie.
it's overcrowded, so I'm out.
Yeah, well, you're not supposed to be here.
you raped him.
you think what we did was rape?
we made love.
tell her, Tommy.
it's true, Julie.
this is my girl.
your mom has a restraining order against her.
lesson number two, Julie-- restraining orders can be broken.
take the baby to the car.
Maggie, we-- Tommy, take the baby to the car!
Tommy, what are you doing?
I'm calling the police.
put the phone down. - He's 16.
so what?!
this is your final lesson, Julie.
do not mess with the teacher.
OK, here's the dealio, and stay with me.
Ben, formerly known as Johnny, was born to Margaret Hallman.
where is she now?
well, uh, she should be at the Fallbrook Women's Correctional Facility, but she was released 4 days ago due to overcrowding.
we thought it was a mental institution.
but if she was released, why kill to get your own kid?
her maternal rights must have been terminated.
Yeah. That happens when you have sex with one of your high school students 2 years ago.
his name, Thomas Brown, aka Tommy Brown, and he is little Johnny's baby daddy, like, for real.
teacher love syndrome.
she gave birth to Tommy's baby in jail, and then when Tommy's mom refused to raise it, the baby was put in foster care.
OK, so we were right.
the baby did spend time in each of the victims' homes. Oh, you betcha.
that would explain the spree and the maternal desire.
she's trying to put her family back together.
Garcia, we need the Browns' address.
Maggie... What'd you do to her?
I just scared her.
you didn't shoot her?
Maggie, she can't die.
what if I died, Tommy?
do you know what they did to me in jail?
God... Ever since I met you, people have been trying to keep us apart.
the teachers at the school tried to.
so did the students.
Maggie, that's not the point.
you know, in medieval times, you could be 12 and get married.
Henry VIII's first wife was much older than he was.
Romeo and Juliet were 13.
look, no one understands that you and I were meant for each other.
that time and age have no meaning.
now, you're the love of my life.
but if I'm not yours, then get out.
get out!
drive.
please...Please help!
female down.
we need an ambulance at 1986 Homer Street.
is Margaret Hallman in the house?
she took Tommy.
OK, you're gonna be ok. What's your name?
Julie, do you know where they went?
no. It hurts.
let's put this on it, ok?
are you Tommy's neighbor?
Yes.
ms. Hallman had their baby with her.
Tommy took all his stuff.
the place is empty.
it's clear here, too.
we need to find out everything we can about Margaret Hallman.
there are probably other victims in her past.
whose house is this?
it's ours.
this is awesome.
you should see inside.
it's beautiful.
I don't know what to say.
Oh...I love you.
I told you it wasn't over.
we're gonna do this, baby.
everyone said you were gonna forget about me when you went to jail.
no way.
how could I?
I wanted to show people the letters, but I didn't want to get in trouble.
that was very, very smart.
you know, I was just writing you this morning.
yeah?
well, you should read it to me. Why don't you go inside, take a shower, and I'll freshen up.
we, uh, we have a lot of catching up to do.
ms. Hallman had an exemplary record in jail.
what was her correspondence like with the outside world?
um, well, she had limited computer use, and she used all of that time searching for a...
her baby?
no. Johnny Lewis is one of her former students from Lake Forrest school.
his parents charged her with molestation, and then they dropped the charges.
when was this?
3 years prior to meeting Tommy.
so she has a baby with Tommy and names it after the first kid she assaulted.
Yeah. And according to the prison's hard drive, she wrote dozens of emails to this Johnny Lewis.
maybe Tommy's a surrogate for him.
Garcia, we need to talk to the Lewises.
mm, their phone is disconnected.
what about an address?
they've moved around a lot.
OK, it's like they're off the grid.
well, who lives in their old house now?
maybe they can help us get info.
uh, it's changed hands a lot.
Oh, snap, crackle, and pop goes the lady weasel.
you'll never guess who bought it.
ms. Hallman.
it was picked up by her sister a year ago and then it was transferred to Maggie's name yesterday.
every day I think about your touch, your smell...
I wonder when we'll be back together again, winter, summer, or fall?
the metal bars that separate us are just temporary, Maggie.
instead of keeping us apart, they've made us closer.
I didn't know life could be so good.
you have the prettiest eyes.
Hey, I'm gonna want another kid, Tommy.
have a big family.
then we'll do that.
I didn't know they tried to hurt you while you were in there.
why didn't you tell me about that in your letters?
well, I didn't want to scare you.
I would have done something.
well, there's nothing you could have done. All that's important is that we're here now.
what is that?
it's the police.
did you call them?!
why would I do that?
let me see your phone.
I didn't call anyone.
maybe Julie did.
if you're lying to me-- I would never...
I would never lie to you.
yeah?
then... Then prove it.
what do you want me to do?
protect your family, honey.
come here, sweetpea.
take the front. Prentiss and I will take the back.
FBI! Drop it!
just--just move.
Move--move back.
Tommy, drop the gun.
just--just get off our yard.
you don't want to do this.
you don't know me.
my--my girl and kid are in there.
she's a predator, Tommy.
no, she's not an animal.
we love each other.
no. No, Tommy, this isn't love.
this is a woman who's been taking advantage of you.
she molested you.
no, I--I knew what I was doing.
did you know that there was another kid exactly like you from another school?
shut up! No. No!
they're lying.
Tommy, she wrote letters to him, too.
that's not true.
and she'd tell him that everything happens for a reason.
be quiet!
she said that he was the love of her life.
that's it!
that she loved sneaking out to see him.
I never thought I'd be sneaking out to see you.
you wrote that to me, Maggie.
Tommy, she wrote it to another boy.
his name was Johnny Lewis, and he lived in this exact house.
I never thought I'd be putting on fancy makeup just to see you smile.
what are they talking about?
she named your kid after him.
is that true?
I wasn't the only one.
I still feel the touch of your skin.
answer me, damn it!
without you, my life would be empty.
without you, I would go numb, and that's why nothing's going to keep us apart, and I mean nothing.
we need paramedics on the front porch.
Maggie. Maggie. Maggie, stay with me.
you were my light.
Maggie, please don't go.
you were my soul.
I don't care what anybody says.
I love you... I love you, Johnny Lewis.
"for every good reason there is to lie, there is a better reason to tell the truth." Bo Bennett.
I will never understand this whole teacher lover thing.
I can barely deal with a grown man.
what's interesting is, if it would have been a male teacher and a female student, he'd have gotten 20 years and none of this would have happened.
well, she could get life plus 20 for all those murders she committed.
you know, it's funny. If she wasn't so pretty, she probably would have never been released in the first place.
what? - It's true.
unattractive female predators serve a longer prison sentence than their attractive counterparts.
that's ridiculous.
it's primal.
there's a hierarchy to everything, including sex offenders.
OK, well, who's ready to get breakfast?
uh, I can't.
there's something I gotta take care of.
OK.
Hey, you.
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
that's totally ok.
I have low-grade esp, so I can pretty much figure out what's going on.
it works ok.
OK, I'll bite.
what am I thinking?
it's not what you're thinking.
it's what Kevin and you were talking about.
I've been racking my brain over what it could be for the last 48 hours.
he's been sweaty, he's been reading my favorite books, he's been getting my favorite foods.
Derek, I hacked into his computer.
Penelope... - He's looking at rings.
you know, the last time I checked, Kevin is a pretty great guy.
I knew it. I knew it.
baby, this is a good thing, isn't it?
maybe to you it is, but not to me.
what happened to your standing Tuesday night date thing?
that has nothing to do with this.
when relationships get more official, they get messy, and you give and you compromise, and people change, and then...
somebody goes away, and you're left empty.
and I don't want that.
I don't--I don't want to be empty.
baby, I really don't think that's going to happen.
Yeah, that's what always happens.
and--and I don't want any part of that.
I don't want any part of it at all.
what's wrong, plum sauce?
you know what? I'm gonna let you guys do, um... What you guys do.
you, uh, you know, don't you?
Kevin... I like the way that things are now.
I love how you have your space and I have my space, and when we come together, we're our own weird world unto ourselves, and...
I don't want to ruin that.
that's not what this would do.
Yeah.
it would.
Penelope, are you, uh, are you against marriage, or are you just against marrying me?
Kevin... I'm just not ready yet.
well, I am.
good morning. Oh. Hey. Morning.
everyone's gathered. We're all ready if you are. Yeah, let's do it.
you need that?
listen, Aaron... Thanks for letting me set this up.
but the whole team really didn't need to be here. I'm the one that owed the favor.
everyone insisted.
how you doing?
Sorry-what? You ok?
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I'm great. I'm good. Uh...
I'll meet you over there in a minute, ok?
it's rare that an undergraduate criminology class gets guest speakers of this caliber.
but today we're specially fortunate.
I'd like to welcome an old friend, esteemed author and FBI Agent David Rossi, and his team, the Behavioral Analysis Unit.
now, they've agreed to spend an hour of their valuable time talking about what they do and how they do it.
so let's make them feel welcome.
thank you, Dr. Grant.
now, when she said I was an old friend, she was just referring to the fact that we've known each other for a very long time.
now, as the good Professor said,
I am supervisory Special Agent Rossi.
these are SSAs Jareau, Prentiss,
Hotchner, and Morgan. This is Dr. Spencer Reid.
and on keyboards today we have our technical analyst
ms. Penelope Garcia.
now, in simple terms, at the BAU we use behavioral science, research, casework, and training to hunt down monsters.
rapists, terrorists, pedophiles, and our specialty, serial killers.
does anybody here know exactly what a serial killer is?
someone who's committed more than one murder.
that's very good. By statute, 3 is the magic number.
and it's actually more qualitative than quantitative for us.
and today we're going to talk about how some serial killers get made.
because if you can understand that, then you can figure out a way to catch them.
Garcia. My liege.
OK, this is Rachel Moore, a 17-year-old runaway from Spokane, Washington.
now, she grew up poor and in a broken home.
her mom left her dad because he liked to drink and beat on her.
and this is Tina Dyson, a 19-year-old college student from Seattle.
now, she was a trust fund kid, and she got straight As and came from a loving family.
now, these two girls couldn't be any more different.
but the one thing that they had in common is they both crossed paths with the most prolific serial killer the BAU has ever seen.
one thing you should understand is that no two killers are the same.
they each occupy their own point on the behavioral spectrum.
genetics, brain chemistry, psychology, and environment are all factors.
but we believe that this particular killer grew up in an environment so adverse that he never had a chance.
bastard!
he endured years of cruel and abject physical abuse.
as well as horribly profound psychological abuse.
no. No!
when he wasn't being ignored, he was being humiliated. Let me in!
let me in! Let me in! Please!
now let me be clear.
most abused kids do not turn into killers.
not even all psychopaths become killers.
but this particular unknown subject, or unsub, suffered extreme abuse, and it has everything to do with why he does what he does.
now, these are some of his victims.
he kidnapped them, he restrained them, and he starved them for days.
then he killed them by mutilating their reproductive organs.
right now we know there are at least 40 of them.
but we believe that he may eventually claim over 100 victims.
now, we chose this case for today because we've been discovering bodies up and down the West Coast since 1992.
for lack of a better word, it's a classic.
this unsub's entire childhood was a crucible, and in it, a psychotic killer was forged.
the philosopher Voltaire wrote, "to the living we owe respect, but to the dead we owe only the truth.
the dead are the cornerstone of every homicide investigation.
victims give us a look into the killer's mind.
if you want to know about a hunter, study his prey.
OK, so the unsub's first victims were discovered two weeks apart in 1992 in Seattle.
the first victim that was found was Rachel Moore. She was the runaway.
her body had been thrown into a dumpster in an alley.
the medical examiner said that she was very malnourished and really dehydrated.
the ligature marks on her wrists and ankles made it apparent that she'd been restrained for days.
he held her, but he didn't feed her.
so she's weak.
it's his sadistic way to subdue her.
several defensive wounds on her hands and forearms.
she put up a hell of a fight. That a girl.
53 stab wounds to the lower abdomen and genitals.
the damage made it impossible to determine if there was any sexual assault.
that might be a forensic countermeasure.
here's my report.
stay as long as you need.
her mother should be here in an hour.
a hell of a way to see her after 2 years.
53 stab wounds. That's a lot of work.
does anyone want to tell me what they think that means? Hatred?
frustration. He's angry.
you're all correct. It's called overkill.
typically it means the murder was personal somehow.
that, or the unsub is psychotic andor prone to violent outbursts.
the overkill may also show his inexperience.
this was probably his first kill, and he was feeling his way through it, working out his M. O.
but there's a lot about Rachel that tells us about the unsub.
she was young, so most likely he was, too.
what makes you think that?
she lived in a shelter and had a part-time job, so she was a street kid, but not necessarily the reckless type.
she wouldn't just go off with anyone.
Yeah, Warden, it's Rossi.
what? Riot?
w- w-w-wait.
look, he's not gonna give me a rain check. I have to see him today.
so the unsub maybe lured her with a ruse or he blitz attacked her, he took her by surprise.
now, either one of these would be easier if you were young. You can tell all that from just one victim?
I'd say it was two weeks later when we found the second victim that we started to piece that together.
Tina Dyson was home for the summer when she disappeared.
her body was found in a shallow grave just outside of Seattle.
but it was actually her abduction site that gave us the answers we needed.
Seattle, 1992
Tina and two of her friends had fake I. D.s and they decided to go to a local grunge bar.
but they drank too much and Tina got sick, so while one friend was inside dancing, the other went out to hold Tina's hair.
it's all right. Come on.
I'm gonna go get Janice, ok? We're going home.
Ohh...Good, yeah.
you ok?
Yeah. Jeez, what are you, a ninja?
Where'd you come from?
so his anger is obviously directed at women.
Yes, but the real question is why, and the why is what always leads us to the who.
I need to talk to you. He was attacking their genitals and reproductive organs.
Why?
was he impotent and hates the thing that he can't have?
did his wife or girlfriend abort a child?
it's a federal prison, Dave.
we can't just call them up and tell them what to do.
you have to know someone in justice who can pull some strings.
I've got to see him today, Aaron. You know that.
the possibilities are endless.
and the unsub was figuring it all out for himself, too. We know that because he was evolving.
he started with a runaway, a victim with a high-risk lifestyle.
he probably knew that her abduction would go unreported.
then he upped his game and grabbed a college girl, which meant more risk for himself.
he dumped his first victim Rachel in an alley, but he took the time to bury Tina, which suggests he felt more connected to her and perhaps he even felt remorse.
did you ever catch this guy? Uh, what's your name, young man?
david Zimmerman. Don't interrupt, Zimmerman.
now, we, uh, we knew we needed to warn the public, so we contacted the media, papers, local news.
that was back before the Internet exploded.
and then, as will happen from time to time, the case went completely cold.
we didn't hear from him again until 1997.
San FRANCISCO, 1997
two bodies were found in Golden Gate Park, in San Francisco.
same M. O. Evidently our guy.
excuse me, I'm looking for the case Agent.
that would be me. Agent Rossi, I'm Agent Hotchner,
Seattle division. We spoke on the phone.
uh, I inherited the case from Agent Bidwell. Thanks for coming so quickly.
Yeah, I hopped the first flight from Dulles. Came straight from the airport.
with bad food. That's a long trip.
let me show you what we found.
a jogger discovered the first body dumped in the bushes about 30 yards over the road here.
the M. E. said that she'd been there almost a month. Any critters get to her?
we had to use dental records to identify her. Watch your step.
so we did a search of the area and we discovered the second body in this shallow grave.
she'd been here less than a week.
so, he dumped the first one and buried the second.
just like he did in '92.
the first victim- was she a runaway? 25-year-old prostitute and crack addict.
the second? A 27-year-old mother of two.
both women had had their reproductive organs completely removed.
not just mangled. He's evolving. Sounds like he's moving more toward ritual.
and apparently he's not locked into an age preference.
the victims seem to be aging along with him.
what about stomach contents? The victims were dehydrated and hadn't eaten in days.
my guess is he hasn't been back in Seattle in a while.
what makes you say that? He needs someplace private to hold them.
he might live close. Dumping a body in a public park is risky.
it tells me that he's comfortable, settled in.
he might even have chosen this spot to be able to come back and relive the kills.
you've done your homework, Agent. 5 years is a long time to be dormant.
he wasn't dormant.
a killer that vicious is like a drug addict that needs a fix.
we were fairly certain that he had kept on killing. We just hadn't found the bodies yet.
now, we knew that back in '92
when the media went wide with the story, our unsub got spooked and he disappeared.
so we tried to get in front of it, meaning that if we could control the spread of information, we might be able to keep the unsub from fleeing again.
but back then the BAU was still young.
we didn't have press liaisons or technical analysts.
by the time we contacted the media, the story had already broken.
a symbol of the American west- a lone coyote hunts for prey.
agent Rossi, are you making any progress in the investigation? Quite a bit, yes.
so do you have any solid leads? Several.
agent Rossi, can you confirm the rumors that the Womb Raider disembowels his victims?
excuse me? Can you confirms the rumors that the womb
Oh, I'll confirm something for you. Womb Raider is a name that you gave him.
I won't glorify him. I call him a murderer.
then exactly how is he killing them?
my only concern is capturing him and bringing closure to the families of the victims.
no further questions.
womb Raider." I hoped the nickname would embolden him.
thought maybe he would escalate and trip on his own hubris.
but, um, that didn't happen.
unfortunately, he vanished just like he'd done before and the trail went cold again.
we did everything we could.
we had every division up and down the West Coast scouring missing person reports.
a lot of possibilities, but no clear hits.
in the meantime, Agent Rossi retired, but the BAU grew.
we trained more profilers, hired tech analysts, press liaisons, and we even got our own resident genius. Thank you. Thank you.
agent Rossi, why did you retire?
that's a good question.
well, the simple answer is I needed a change.
I was working on my third divorce, and...
third? Yes, Zimmerman, my third.
so I needed a break, and I figured writing books might help give me some peace of mind.
did it? Give you peace of mind?
for a time, yes.
in 2005, we got another hit on the unsub, this time in Los Angeles.
we knew it was him because of his signature. Sorry, what's a signature?
it's a rare combination of M. O. and ritual that allows us to link cases over time and geographic distances.
her name was Lana Cooper. She was a 33-year-old prostitute.
her body was found by a boy walking his dog in Griffith Park.
ligature marks on her wrists and ankles. She was restrained.
and he gave her a complete hysterectomy.
the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, all removed.
a little crude, but he cut all the right ligaments. He knew what he was doing.
what about her throat?
that was done postmortem. He cut out her vocal cords.
might be a symbolic way of keeping her silent.
so she was alive when he performed the hysterectomy.
anything in her stomach? Dry as a bone. She hadn't eaten in days.
so he starved her, too. That's a pretty specific M. O.
this probably isn't his first victim. I wonder if we should be looking at doctors and medical students.
it's definitely not his first victim. I don't think he's a doctor or a medical student.
no. Calling Gideon?
the first call I made was to Agent Rossi.
I knew he was writing his book, but I didn't want to start to build a profile without him.
a profile is personality and identifying characteristics of the unsub which helps the investigator narrow down the suspect pool.
basically it's a behavioral description of the type of person we think the unsub might be.
it goes a little like this
we were looking for a white male in his early to mid-30s.
we think he was antisocial and had low self-esteem, so he probably kept to himself.
but he needed money, so he was most likely a day laborer, a janitor, maybe a handyman.
anything menial and temporary.
he was personable enough to get a job wherever he went, but unassuming enough not to stick out.
he held and restrained his victims for days, so he would need a contained space to do that.
but he was also mobile. That meant he had his own transport.
most likely a truck or a van.
and when he was on the move and not settled, he probably lived out of that vehicle.
we knew he always started with a victim who lived a high-risk lifestyle, like a prostitute or a runaway.
and then he moved on to a victim with a low-risk lifestyle.
so we knew his next kill would be something of a soccer mom in her 30s.
I'm sorry, but what exactly was he doing with the organs he was removing?
we didn't know. It could have been some sort of fetish.
russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo actually ate the uterus of one of his victims.
Oh, my God, eew.
this focus on reproductive organs could also indicate a deep-seated sense of self-loathing.
he might have hated the fact that he was born.
or he had some sort of traumatic life-changing event associated with birth.
and he could have hated his own mother.
the strained mother-child relationship is a hallmark for many killers.
that doesn't make any sense. I hate myself or I hate my mother, so I kill women by ripping out their wombs?
it only needs to make sense to him.
one man's logic is another man's crazy.
what's the deal with the vocal cords? That was something new.
we thought it might have been symbolic of his own silence.
he was raised to believe he was worthless and unwanted, so essentially he never had his own voice.
his victims became surrogates for his rage and a means by which to exact his revenge.
we stayed in L. A. for 6 weeks and worked the case.
and then it went cold, again.
no low-risk soccer mom turned up, no soccer moms went missing.
then our resources were exhausted, we had other cases, so we were forced to leave.
but I rented a house in the Hollywood Hills and decided to finish my book out there.
I figured if I was close I could lend a hand if something happened.
3 months I stayed and nothing.
now, in the past he packed up and moved when the story broke and we got too close.
but this time the media was quiet.
the victim was a hooker nobody cared about.
so, what drove him under?
it would be 4 years before we got another break.
not too long after, I came out of retirement.
what?
Rochelle Jenkins, a 40-year-old prostitute was found dumped in an alley in Seattle.
she was given a complete hysterectomy.
her vocal cords were cut out, too.
he's back where he got started.
he'll be on the hunt for a low-risk victim in her 40s next.
I wonder what brought him home.
it's a long trip. We should get going.
but this time we were ready for him.
we wanted to use the press to our advantage.
so we came up with what's called a targeted media strategy.
agent, is it true you have a suspect in custody? Yes, he's being questioned as we speak.
can you tell us how you apprehended him?
with good police work, especially from the Seattle P. D.
and the Washington State Patrol.
is it true that the killer's been on the loose since the early nineties?
that remains to be seen, but we do believe we can link him to several murders.
thank you. Now, if you'll excuse us, we've got work to do. So you did catch him.
no. But we wanted him to think we caught the wrong guy.
Why? To give him a false sense of security.
if he thinks we messed up, then maybe he relaxes and makes a mistake.
that, or he gets angry because he thinks someone else is stealing his thunder.
either way, the aim of the strategy is the throw the killer off course.
otherwise, all we're doing is reacting to him, and we needed him to react to us.
lord knows I love him, but here's to a night without him.
husbands, too. To the kids.
OK, fine, have it your way. We're too old for this.
speak for yourself.
OK, ladies, bottoms up, lick, drink, suck. Yeah?
she's whoo-hooing, you know we're in for a long night.
we need some more water.
we should get another round.
you're insane.
play date tomorrow? Meet me at the park?
can't. Soccer game and birthday party. Sunday? Ok. Sure.
you all right to drive? That drink was what, two hours and a big dinner ago.
are you sure? I'm fine. Go.
OK Bye, sweetie.
Bye, girls. I'll talk to you soon, ok?
OK. Yes. Good night.
Hey, honey. I'm on the way home. How are the boys?
Oh, it was fun. Everyone says hi. Ok.
love you, too.
Bye.
he's been moving south this whole time.
he could have gone east or bounced back up north, but no, always south.
almost like he's running from something. Well, he's running from us.
but why go back home now, after all these years? Something brought him back.
Rochelle Jenkins was in her 40s, so we can assume he is, too.
OK, so why do people come home at that age?
family, special occasions, funeral.
wait a minute. You guys have your own jet?
Yes, Zimmerman, as a matter of fact, we do.
show them, Penelope. One second...
OK. There you go.
pretty sweet, huh? Yeah.
Hey, guys, a missing persons report just came in.
42 years old, Grace Powell, mother of two, went out for girls night, never came home.
that's gotta be him. Garcia, where did he take her from?
I recognized the place immediately.
it was hard to forget.
this is where he took Tina Dyson from in '92.
this restaurant was a dive bar.
a dive bar? In this neighborhood? Things were different then.
he didn't just come back home. He returned to the exact same spot.
but why here? What is it about this place?
it's where he grabbed one of his first kills.
the first ones are always significant.
and this is where my particular skill set comes in handy.
see, I am like one of those wonderful people in prison movies that can get you anything you need.
and we needed to know everything there was to know about this particular part of the city.
so I went honey badger.
I dug up police reports, news articles, parking tickets, even.
if anything went down in that area in the last 40 years, I knew about it.
and I found zip. Zero. Stingy with the dinero.
couple of Fender-benders. A bar fight.
there was a homeless guy who was into mooning people, but no life-changers.
so I extended my search another 10 years and I found this.
this is a police report from 1966, where a 16-year-old girl was found raped in a parked car on that street.
but she was a minor, so her name wasn't listed on the report.
well, what's this girl got to do with a serial killer?
pump your brakes, sweetcakes, 'cause I'm bringing it home.
it turns out that Jane Doe, instead of given a name, she was given a patient number.
so I tracked that number, and it turned out that she went back to that hospital several times after... for prenatal care.
and she eventually brought that baby to term.
she hemorrhaged badly during childbirth, and during her emergency hysterectomy she died.
it was at that point that I was able to find the corresponding death certificate and get her name.
Georgina Yates. Her son Thomas Yates survived.
he was put into the custody of his grandparents
Trudy and Roy Yates, Georgina's parents.
when we started looking at Thomas...
we knew.
growing up, he got kicked out of two schools, both times for starting fires.
fire-starting is the first part of what we used to call the homicidal triad.
the other two parts are bedwetting and cruelty to animals.
he was also in the emergency room a lot as a kid.
he had a broken arm, burns, he broke a rib once.
so he was either very clumsy or he was being beaten.
then when he was 15, he committed his first murder.
he was a skinny kid who snapped and stabbed a bully at school.
he was convicted, served 3 years in juvey, another 7 in prison, and then he was released on parole.
but when he was on the inside, he spilled his guts to the prison shrink.
he talked about how his grandmother would starve him and make him sleep in the dog house.
how she would beat him senseless... I wish you were never born!
and sit on him until he couldn't breathe. You're a curse!
I hate you! And you actually believed this guy?
the prison psychiatrist concluded that Thomas was telling the truth.
his childhood medical records also corroborated this story.
and at that point we realized it wasn't the mother but the grandmother who was the object of his rage.
I have Senator Hendricks on the line.
then I find out his grandfather had just died, and his grandmother had lung cancer and she had just been admitted into hospice care.
and that is what brought Thomas home.
Seattle, 2009
excuse me, uh, Mrs. Trudy Yates?
who are you?
I'm Agent Prentiss. This is Agent Jareau. We're with the FBI.
FBI? You got the right Trudy Yates?
Yes, I'm pretty sure we do, ma'am.
you're Thomas' grandmother, right? What about it?
we're looking for him. Tommy? He in trouble?
What'd he do this time? Do you know where he is?
no idea. When was the last time you saw him?
the day he put me in this damn place.
my daughter's womb was cursed.
that boy was a bastard born in sin.
nothing good comes out of sin.
this is all we have. Thank you so much. Please give us a call if you think of anything else.
will do. Thank you.
baby, what can I do you for? Hey, mama, I need you to run a number.
okey-dokey. It is a prepaid cell phone, hasn't been used in days.
and what about this address?
2334 Dawson Street, unit K.
hold yourself, please.
unit K? He needs to be more isolated than an apartment.
it was a storage container.
the same storage container where his grandmother's stuff was being held.
you smell that?
it's coffee.
FBI!
drop it.
thomas Yates, you're under arrest.
she's still got a pulse.
calling an ambulance. Agent Rossi.
nice to meet you after all these years.
we got Grace Powell to the hospital in time and they saved her life.
though I'm not sure her psychological wounds will ever heal.
how come I've never heard of this guy? Have you ever heard of Efren Saldivar?
no. David Parker Ray.
how about John Edward Robinson?
see, at any given time, we have at least 25 open cases.
every year we're able to close around 15, yet new ones still seem to pop up.
there are more serial killers out there than you may think.
but we finally had Yates in custody, and we questioned him for two weeks straight.
we all took turns. He didn't say a word.
never asked for a bathroom break, glass of water, nothing.
I thought given his M. O. being female,
I might be able to strike a nerve, get him to open up, but he just sat there, for hours.
staying absolutely silent under that kind of pressure was a skill he undoubtedly learned as a child.
he was rendered silent for so long, it became a conditioned response.
but we had him safely in custody. And we had other cases to solve.
eventually Yates was tried and he received the death penalty.
and life went on.
then two years ago today...
I got a call.
you have a call from an inmate in a correctional facility.
inmate, state your name. It's Tommy Yates.
this call may be monitored and recorded. Press 2 if you accept the charges.
if not, hang up.
he called you personally? How'd he get your number? Probably from his attorney.
what did he want?
he wanted to make a deal, and I was the only one he would make it with.
can we be alone, please?
what do you want? Nice to see you, too.
why am I here, Yates? I told you.
I want to make a deal.
you're on death row, not exactly a strong negotiating position.
I've got something for you.
it's a present. Open it.
what is it? Open it and see.
you shouldn't have.
surprise.
those are some of the girls I took.
the ones you didn't find.
there's 40 there.
why should I believe you? I thought you might ask that.
it's all part of the deal. Look, let's get something straight.
there is no deal. Not yet.
not ever.
there's actually 101 names.
and I remember all of them.
and I'll tell you where I put them.
here's what I want.
One-no death penalty.
I don't care if I rot in here.
but no chair and no injections.
2- I want a transfer to the East Coast.
grandma's dead. Nothing holding me here.
Plus, I like the idea of snow in the winter.
never really had that growing up.
I didn't come all this way to get smoke blown up my ass.
after I get my sentence commuted and my transfer,
I'll give you more names. But only one each year.
to keep you honest. You understand.
anything else? Yes.
I get to decide when you get the name.
it'll be on a special day of my choosing.
and you have to come and get it from me personally.
what do you say, Agent?
deal?
we checked the list he gave us, and then we went out to the locations where he said he'd dumped the bodies, and we found all 40.
did you actually make a deal with that maniac?
we did.
not to bend to his will, but to bring the families of the victims some peace.
I'd been on the case so long, I felt obligated to contact each of the families personally.
Mrs. Ruth Thomas?
I'm Agent David Rossi from the FBI.
I have some information about your daughter Sarah.
I'm afraid I've got bad news about Jessica...
we found Chloe two days ago in Griffith park.
I can't tell you how sorry I am for your loss.
if I can do anything, anything at all, please don't hesitate.
does it ever get hard dealing with all that tragedy?
you know, it's funny.
some cases, they end well, so you can forget them.
and some, like this one... they become a part of you.
dead kids. Mutilated bodies.
it's all so horrible. How do you do it?
irish statesman and author Edmund Burke once wrote, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
this job isn't just what I do, it's who I am.
is it worth it?
for every life we save?
damn right it is.
absolutely it's worth it. I can't imagine doing anything else.
Yes, Mr. Zimmerman.
so, you have to go visit this guy every year to get the name of another victim.
that's right.
so what was the special day of his choosing?
you really don't want us to go with you? It's no trouble at all.
no, it's ok. Rossi, it's like 2 hours away.
come on, I can drive. I'll get us there in less than an hour. I'm good, really.
we could stop for dinner on the way home. Stop.
all of you. I'll be fine. We'll see you tomorrow.
you bet.
Ohh, is he gonna be ok? Of course he is.
it's Rossi.
agent Rossi.
I can't believe it's been a year already.
time flies.
man, you must have some serious juice.
thought for sure we were gonna have to cancel.
riot in the yard, tight-ass warden.
whole place is locked down.
any plans for the big day?
come on. You should get out and do something.
never know how many of these you got left. What's her name?
I used to hate birthdays when I was a kid.
that's why I like celebrating yours.
her name.
took her in Eureka.
drove her out to the Headwaters Forest Preserve up on Elk River Road.
100 yards South of the trailhead, put her under a big old Sequoia.
open gate 241.
and many more.)
dallas P. D. discovered an unidentified male body, with the mouth sewn shut.
like the Silencer.
it's obviously a copycat.
yesterday while we were in Florida, a body was found in the desert outside Las Cruces, New Mexico.
a man had his leg amputated and replaced with the leg of someone else.
someone's out there mimicking the crimes we solved.
this is now an active case, which we'll be investigating along with our other cases.
I need to tell you something. Maeve's missing.
I think her stalker has her.
hello. I'm still here.
Zug...Zwang.
Zugzwang.
it's a chess term. It describes the point in the game when a player realizes he'll inevitably be checkmated.
please...
let me go!
Oh, God!
God can't help you now. Please be quiet.
stop it.
you won't feel a thing.
Alex. Do you have a minute?
I'm actually trying to finish up so I can get home tonight.
you got my voicemails?
I haven't had time to return calls.
agent Hotchner tells me you're settling in nicely.
I'm glad to hear it.
it's a great team.
listen, I was hoping that we could talk, over coffee, maybe.
I thought we might try to bury the hatchet once and for all.
Erin, no disrespect, but it's not necessary.
what happened between us happened a long time ago.
I've moved on. You should, too.
well, that's... What I'm trying to do.
look, I'm not very good at this, but I want you to know that I'm so sorry for what I did to you.
apology accepted?
apologies are just words.
I want to make amends, and that takes work.
I think Blake could take her. What do you think?
mm, their body language hardly seems adversarial.
Blake's making direct eye contact, and the tilt of her head suggests she's willingly engaged in conversation.
didn't Strauss throw her under the bus back in the day?
it was on the Amerithrax case about 10 years ago.
evidently they apprehended the wrong suspect and she let Blake take the fall.
well, I heard they even demoted her a couple grades.
guess what just came to the reception desk for an Agent Jennifer Jareau.
from who?
they must be from Will.
or someone's got some 'splainin' to do.
open it. Open it. Open it.
Just...Will's not really a flower bouquet type guy.
Zugzwang.
what? Let me see that.
that's the same thing Diane Turner said to you.
before she killed Maeve.
but Diane's dead. So who sent it?
no idea.
wait... Didn't you say the voice on the other end of the payphone was computer generated?
that means it could be from anybody.
that means that it maybe doesn't have anything to do with Maeve.
whoever it was... they knew you would be at that phone booth.
which means they were stalking you.
or us.
what if this is the Replicator.
I just came from the Director's office.
he doesn't like the idea that his agents are being taunted and he wants me to keep him personally in the loop.
catch me up, please.
okay, so, uh, the flowers cleared all of our security checkpoints.
which means there's no explosives, no chemical residue. Nothing.
they were ordered from a local florist-- Wendy's Bloomers.
I checked Wendy, her bloomers, the employees the delivery service. They all came out clean.
I managed to track down the credit card.
it's a stolen card number, and it was ordered from a prepaid cell phone in Philadelphia.
but it's all about the message he's trying to send.
but they were sent to JJ. Why her?
Yeah, the original zugzwang taunt was directed at me.
if it's directed at one of us, it's directed at all of us.
it's only a matter of time before his taunts turn to threats.
I'm posting security details at each of our homes.
well, he's communicating directly. What exactly is he trying to say?
that the game has changed.
first he was chasing us, copying the cases that we'd solved, and now it's our turn to chase him.
tag, we're it.
what do we know about the Replicator?
so far he's committed 3 murders in 3 different states.
the first was Maxwell Holmes, 28-year-old contractor, husband, and father of two, from Dallas.
he was found with his mouth sewn shut 4 weeks after we closed the Silencer case.
next is an unidentified John Doe. He was found in New Mexico near the Mexican border.
his leg was severed and someone else's was transplanted on.
do we have any idea where the limb comes from?
none.
finally, Megan Lewinbuck, 31-year-old paralegal, single mother.
she was found in Phoenix.
she was found last week.
all her joints were dislocated and she'd been turned into a human marionette.
and that's everything so far. Local police and Bureau field offices are going to keep us apprised of any developments.
I want this case closed quickly.
copycat murders, flowers sent.
I see this as an assault on the entire Bureau.
uh, sir, Philadelphia P. D. just uploaded a homicide to ViCAP.
an unidentified woman was found this morning exsanguinated with her eyelids removed.
it's just like our blood artist Bryan Hughes.
Philadelphia, the same city the flowers were ordered from.
jet's standing by. Wheels up in 20.
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Charles Caleb Colton.
the Replicator sent those flowers today knowing that that body would be discovered.
and he's taken the time to track our cases.
it's not too much trouble to track news headlines with a Google search.
Yeah, but the original zugzwang message was delivered to me at a phone booth, which means he's not just tracking our cases, he's tracking everything we do.
why would someone do that?
we've been taunted before.
guys like Randall Garner. Usually malignant narcissists who feel the need to show off.
so maybe he wants us to see how smart he is.
but why?
what's the point? Is it a warning?
is he mocking us?
maybe all of the above.
he's not attempting to hide his kills, so it's probably his way of bragging.
he's probably trying to lure us out.
he certainly wants our attention.
we have a total of 4 copycat murders and no apparent connection between the victims.
my guess is they're all targets of opportunity.
who he kills doesn't matter.
the point is to get to us.
the latest victim was in Philadelphia.
Bryan Hughes bled his victims in San Francisco.
all the other copycat murders occurred in the same area as the original kills. Why is this one different?
it's his game. He can change the rules anytime he wants.
all that traveling clearly he's got the money and the time.
and patience.
his organization and attention to detail suggests some sort of bigger plan.
greetings, crime-fighters.
we just got an I. D.on the first exsanguinated, eyelidless body.
her name is Molly Patton, 27.
she was a nurse at a local hospital.
Garcia, what do you mean by first?
I mean that a second exsanguinated, eyelidless body was just discovered.
he's moving fast.
Oh, excuse me. Can I help you?
I'm Agent Morgan. Agent Jareau.
Dr. Spencer Reid.
feds? What are you doing here?
assisting the investigation.
well, no one told me.
someone probably just forgot to make a phone call.
just an oversight, I'm sure.
Yeah, I guess so.
you mind showing us the victim?
Yeah, right this way.
is there anything you can tell us about her?
her name was Sandy Larson.
went missing two days ago.
she was a retired widow with 6 grandkids.
any idea where she was last seen?
found her car at a drugstore across town.
apparently she fills a prescription every Wednesday morning.
if that's where he grabbed her, he was probably aware of her routine.
she's fully clothed and he posed the body.
it could mean he feels remorse.
Oh, yeah. I'm sure he was all broken up about it.
excuse me.
he's replicating his replication.
all the other copycat murders were single kills, but this is his second exsanguination.
Bryan Hughes posed his victims staring directly at art.
there's nothing like that around here.
different setting, slightly different M. O.
are we sure this is the Replicator?
femoral arteries were severed in both legs.
cause of death is exsanguination.
ligature marks, like he had her strapped down.
you also found Ketamine in her system?
enough to knock us all out.
no signs of torture, and he sedated her before he bled her out.
so maybe he's not so much sadistic as mission-oriented.
cops said she disappeared after her yoga class. Is that true?
that was the last place she was seen, yes.
my God. I used to practice at that same studio.
that class was 8: 00 in the morning and right off a busy intersection.
he grabbed his victims in broad daylight.
he's either using a ruse or a discreet threat of violence.
either way, he's awfully bold.
excuse me, miss?
would you care to sign a petition to help clean up the Delaware River?
sorry, I don't have time right now.
did you know that the Delaware River is the fifth most polluted river in our country?
I had no idea, but good luck.
last year, they dumped more than 6. 7 million pounds of toxic chemicals there and nobody's doing anything about it.
you are.
but they won't listen until we all speak up.
the Clean Water Act is an unfulfilled promise and our children are the ones paying for it.
come on, it's just a signature.
I'll even help you with your groceries.
no. No, that's ok. Here, I'll sign.
Oh, awesome.
thank you.
where?
that line right there.
the pen isn't working.
Oh. Sorry about that.
just grab you another one.
do not scream and do not run.
think about your son, Shannon.
his name's Eddie, right?
I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding.
you have our full cooperation.
isn't that right, Detective?
I thought you needed 3 murders to have federal jurisdiction.
we have probable cause to believe that the unsub is responsible for 3 other murders in different states.
probable cause. But you don't know for sure.
that's what we're here to determine.
look, we're wasting our time here.
we should be out there looking for this guy.
we're only here to help.
a bunch of pencil pushers and accountants. How you gonna help?
Rizzo! I'm sorry?
Hey, what's with you? You need a hug or something?
I need to take you off this case?
no.
then cut the crap.
where?
OK, thanks.
another body just turned up.
that makes 3.
she's at Fairmont Park. Get out there.
and take them with you.
victim's name is Shannon Lavin, 29 years old.
husband said she never came home from the grocery store this morning.
another kidnapping in broad daylight.
this is turning into a spree.
an efficient one.
it's been fewer than 12 hours since she disappeared.
we still have yet to locate her vehicle.
I bet he stole it during the abduction.
found a way to get close to her and threaten her somehow.
probably even made her drive.
what else do we know about her?
she's got a 4-year-old kid.
it's impossible to tell when or where this photo was taken.
it's shot on a telephoto lens and the frame's too small.
well, his message is getting more clear.
he's not just taunting us, now he's targeting us.
he must have channeled years of anger to come up with a plan as intricate as this.
this is his way of torturing us.
this isn't just about anger. This is about revenge.
for what?
if we can figure that out that's how we'll catch him.
so first it was Reid at the phone booth, then me with the flowers, now Hotch. Which one of us is next?
cause of death is definitely exsanguination.
she only has about half a liter left.
same ligature marks as the others.
was there Ketamine in the system?
tox screen's not back, but it's a safe bet.
her liver is inflamed and she's slightly jaundiced.
see that a lot with Ketamine overdoses.
body snatchers told me they found a picture of you at the crime scene.
we believe that the unsub is targeting us personally, yes.
he's using these victims to send us some kind of message.
what kind of message?
we're not sure yet.
I hope you catch him soon.
Hey, Aaron.
she was a nurse.
just like Molly Patton.
at your service, sir.
Garcia, I need you to find out everything you can about our second victim Sandy Larson.
copy that, uh...
she was a baby boomer, originally from Chicago.
her husband Saul died 10 years ago from pancreatic cancer.
employment?
she was retired, but before that, she worked as an administrator at a hospice care facility.
anything before that?
before that, she was a...
she was a registered nurse for 30 years.
that's the connection.
I need you to go to ViCAP and find out everything you can about homicides involving nurses.
I am like the wind. Back in a flash.
Where's that lightning? Anyway...
we've got a video conference with Strauss in 10 minutes.
she on the warpath?
she's under a lot of pressure to get results. We all are.
well, I've seen her under pressure before.
it was right when she tried to ruin my career.
this psychopath's message is clearly personal and it's making us look bad.
someone profiling our profilers undermines the efficacy of everything you do, and I'm going to be frank with you
both the Director and the Attorney General want to take you off this case, and I can't say I totally disagree.
Why?
because you're victims now, and I'm concerned your ability to investigate may be compromised.
Yeah, well, I assure you our abilities are just fine.
Ron?
Yes, it is, ma'am, absolutely.
we know this case better than anyone.
all right. Well, I'll tell the Director if he takes you off the case, it's either with my resignation or over my dead body.
ma'am, we're starting the briefing now.
I'll be right there.
you catch this son of a bitch, Aaron.
understood.
do you really think they'd replace us?
sounds like you'd have to kill Strauss first, and I doubt if that's as easy as it sounds.
all right, so what do we know?
this photo isn't digital.
it was printed on real chromogenic photo paper.
so he's old school.
we're still trying to ascertain when the photo was taken.
Garcia, I'm putting you on speaker.
you guys, there are a shocking number of weirdoes out there who have a thing for nurses.
but I got a gigantenormous hit.
15 years ago, the BAU had a case in Pittsburgh involving the stabbing murders of 4 nurses.
pittsburgh? That's close enough to be related.
that rings a bell. But I didn't work that case, Gideon did.
Yeah, yeah. It ended relatively well.
the killer Jack Lee Kemper was caught, and we managed to save one of his would-be victims.
Garcia, what happened to Kemper?
he died 5 months ago from lethal injection.
what if that was the trigger?
the Silencer copycat murder happened about 5 months ago.
we believe we're looking for a white male in his mid-40s or possibly even 50s.
he's criminally and forensically sophisticated, so he may be an ex-con or have law enforcement training.
you saying he could be a cop?
it's unlikely, but we can't rule it out.
this unsub is using his victims as a device with which to antagonize the FBI, the BAU in particular.
so he's after you.
he's been copycatting murder cases that we've closed all over the country.
we do have reason to believe that he's been stalking each member of this team.
so he's extremely mobile and has the time and the means with which to get around.
and the intelligence to cover his tracks and remain evasive.
we think it all started 15 years ago with a case we had in Pittsburgh that involved the death of 4 nurses.
that killer, Jack Lee Kemper, was apprehended, and he was recently executed.
because the most recent exsanguination victims were also nurses, we believe this case holds some kind of special meaning to him.
so we should be looking at Kemper's family, friends, and associates.
they may be trying to avenge his death, or they might be convinced that he was wrongfully accused.
we should also look at friend and relatives of the victims.
they may blame us for not solving the case fast enough.
this unsub is intelligent and highly organized, but he's also hellbent on revenge.
which makes him especially dangerous.
thank you.
where the hell have you been?
you were supposed to call me hours ago.
we had a deal.
well, why set a time if you're not gonna stick to it?
you know how I hate that!
it's inconsiderate, never mind rude.
OK. Ok, you're right, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
thank you for calling me back.
there's just been a lot going on.
nothing. Nothing. Just...work and stuff.
don't worry about it.
well, we've ruled out every name on the list.
our guy's not connected to Jack Lee Kemper's victims.
you know, if they were just friends or lovers, there might not be an official record of their relationship.
the only living relative Kemper has is a third cousin who lives in Alaska.
well, it wasn't one of his friends.
Kemper didn't have any. He was a recluse with no social skills.
well, who else would have a vendetta against us?
it could be a fan of Kemper's. These guys always seem to have followers.
what about somebody we put into prison?
it's a little hard to orchestrate all of this from behind bars.
what if somebody from the outside's helping him?
and how about other suspects in the case?
that's it. - What?
of course. He was the primary suspect before we caught Kemper.
we had a strong circumstantial case, but DNA eventually cleared him.
his name got leaked to the press the second we grabbed him.
why so fast?
we thought it was probably someone in the local P. D.
how long did we hold him for? - Couple of weeks.
give me stuff to do
Garcia, I need everything you've got on Donnie Bidwell.
he was a suspect in the Jack Lee Kemper case.
right. Ok, he was picked up a couple of times for assault and lewd behavior.
he got off with time served and probation.
he is a recently divorced father of two.
he cannot hold down a job.
I count 1, 2,3, 4,5...
12 jobs in the last 10 years, everything from fry cook to used car salesman.
Yeah, but before all that he was in construction or something, right?
affirmative. He owned his own hot mop shower, pan company, whatever that is. That business went south after the arrest.
his legal fees wiped him out, and then a year later, oh, dear, he had himself a nervous breakdown.
no wonder he wants payback. That accusation ruined his life.
have you got an address?
Yeah, I got home and work and I'm sending both.
Thanks.
we better make sure we get this right before we arrest this guy again.
Rossi, Blake, and Reid take the work address.
the rest of us will take the house.
clear.
clear!
gun!
he's going out back! - Are you ok?
he's heading south.
FBI! Don't move.
drop the gun. - Do it now!
drop it!
slow.
slowly.
now turn around.
I said turn around!
what's the matter? - A little tight?
my bad. Let's go.
agent Morgan.
Hey, listen.
I just wanted to say, uh...
thank you.
don't mention it.
you saved my life.
I owe you.
no, Detective Rizzo, you don't owe me anything.
we're both on the same team here.
so, uh...
5 years ago my partner was-- was shot and killed, we were assisting on a federal case.
ever since then, I just...
I get it.
I do.
it's all good.
I'm sorry about your partner.
if there's ever anything you need anything.
I appreciate that.
this guy ask for his phone call yet?
no. Just for these.
they're anticonvulsants.
just a few weeks after his arrest, he got jumped in a bar.
police report said the guys who did it thought he was the nurse killer.
he took a blow to the head and he's had a seizure disorder ever since.
can I get you anything else?
you know, I,uh...heh,
I wasn't on that case, but I remember you.
you probably recall my associate,
agent Jason Gideon.
too bad he retired.
he should be here to see this.
Yeah, you know, I know that things went pretty bad with you after that whole thing. I don't blame you for being angry.
we made an erroneous accusation.
Oh, is that what you call it?
erroneous?
my life went in the toilet.
well, you got judged in the court of public opinion.
that's gotta be hard.
I mean, I'd want payback, too.
don't sit there and pretend like you know how this feels.
you have no idea.
found this in the hall closet.
it's all about the nurse murders 15 years ago.
there's two sets of files, one about his arrest, the other about Jack Lee Kemper.
it's not surprising he obsessed over the case.
Oh, sir, hi, it's me.
Garcia, whose number is this?
sorry. I had Anderson give me a ride.
I desperately needed a shower and some food that wasn't sold in a machine.
OK, so I cleaned out Bidwell's computer and I checked his phone records.
he mostly calls his ex-wife. A lot of emails, too.
it is not a pretty picture. They separated a few years ago.
she took the kids with her.
they just recently got the divorce finalized.
she's already pregnant with another guy's kid.
when was the divorce finalized?
uh, 5 months.
this might not have been about Kemper's execution at all.
the divorce might have been the stressor.
Oh, and, sir, his ex-wife, she's a nurse.
come on, Donnie, help me to help you.
we were wrong about you the first time.
don't you want to make sure that we get it right this time?
well, I'll tell you what.
I'll give you a few more minutes to think about it, ok?
something's not right.
this is his crowning moment.
all that work he did to replicate those murders.
he should be singing like a canary.
especially if he's a narcissist.
I want to try something.
Hi, Donnie.
I'm Agent Blake.
you've already met my associate Agent Jareau.
sure you don't want to take your meds?
go ahead.
you know, I was reading through your file, and I saw that you had two kids.
girls, right?
that's Sophie and Laura?
right.
they're beautiful.
I have a little boy.
and I don't know what I'd do if someone took him from me.
I know your girls are older now, but think about how hard this is gonna be for them.
if you cooperate with us, you can make things much easier for everyone.
his car's got almost 100, 000 miles on it.
you think he drove cross-country to replicate those murders?
well, with his sporadic work schedule, it's possible.
Plus, it's cheaper than flying.
it's printed on photographic paper also.
those are eyelids.
Yeah.
I'll let the rest of the team know.
that sounds terrible.
one day I just came home from work and they were gone.
poof.
did your wife ever say anything about leaving?
not a word.
she just packed up the girls and left.
they're my kids.
my kids.
they were so little then. They didn't understand.
it's hard.
hard?
hard?
you ruined my life.
I was arrested for no reason.
I was publicly humiliated.
my face smeared all over the news.
they treated me like garbage.
I was behind bars for weeks.
I was innocent.
but people's lives stink so bad that they just love when they can watch somebody else take a fall. It's like a car wreck.
they can't take their eyes off of it.
I know you.
you're that guy on the news.
all I could do was suck on it.
no, no, no-- that wasn't me.
15 years. 15 years and not a peep from the FBI.
no letter, no email, no "sorry we turned your life upside down, Donnie." Nothing!
well, it must feel real good to release it after all these years.
you're damn right.
those nurses that I bled out, this time they're your fault.
you people made me into this.
alright, so that is why you followed us across the country and copycatted these?
you wanted us to look as bad as you did.
I mean, it's just an awful lot of work, Donnie.
we have New Mexico, uh, Dallas,
D. C.
what are those?
what are you talking about?
we found your photo collection, the one hidden under your bed.
and your victims' eyelids, too.
what?
just cooperate with us, Donnie, tell us everything, and give yourself a chance to see your girls again.
I want my lawyer.
I have a phone call. I get a phone call.
OK.
that doesn't make sense.
he just admitted to killing the nurses, and the second I bring up the copycat murders, he lawyers up.
he looked as if this was all news to him.
check him out. He's a bundle of nerves.
it could all be an act.
he might still be trying to manipulate us.
well, if he is gonna lawyer up, that's a privileged conversation.
come on, I'll buy us a cup of coffee.
Yeah, thanks, Dave.
so Bidwell confessed to the exsanguinations, but he wants to see his lawyer before he admits to anything else.
we've found more than enough evidence to prove he's the Replicator.
I had the same thought, but the house doesn't fit the profile. It's too sloppy.
he is a single male.
but the plan to get to us was detailed and organized and nothing in this house says that.
Hello?
it's me.
I've been arrested.
you...
he probably wasn't expecting to get caught so soon.
so maybe we threw a wrench in his master plan.
which is what?
we got a problem.
it's Bidwell.
he was only alone for a second.
he took them all.
someone get the paramedics!
I just talked to Strauss. She wants an update.
what happened?
Bidwell died en route to the hospital.
this guy did not profile as suicidal.
