check it out! Buckingham Palace.
that's in London, brainless. It's the Callaway house.
nobody's lived there for years. It's haunted.
it's not either! -Ask anyone. Every full moon...
...old lady Callaway's ghost crosses the lake and eats a camper.
Yeah, right. And Santa Claus lives with the tooth fairy in Oueens.
you ever been there? -No.
if it's not haunted. why don't you go ring the doorbell?
you think I'm scared? -Five bucks says you're chicken.
cough it up, choirboy!
show me your money.
this I got to see!
they say the first Mrs. Callaway was a lovely woman...
...but look at this room!
no wonder she's dead! She had absolutely no taste.
I can't wait to sell this house.
I want one bar set up in here and two out in the patio.
well, hello, munchkin!
daddy!
honey, what's the matter?
you all right? -No!
what?
what happened?
she hates this house!
let's not be dramatic, darling. She was hiding in the den.
I simply said that we might fix it up someday.
that is, if you'll let me.
who is she?
there's no easy way to say this.
sweetheart...
...Clarice and I will be married next month.
you'll finally have a real family. She's going to be your new mother.
Itsn't that wonderful?
she does this sometimes.
honey. -And she gets away with it.
I'm sorry. Roger, but little tantrums mustn't be rewarded.
come on, sweetheart.
you're making it worse.
I know what I'm talking about.
all right, people!
back to work, Shoo!
let's focus on the engagement party.
sure hope you're right.
trust me, I'm a woman.
look at the time! I've got to get my face on.
how's about some milk and cookies?
I've lost my mother. Now I've lost my father.
I have no family!
I'm an orphan, and I'm running away!
and don't you dare tell Daddy!
we got to hide! -What if we get caught?
don't let her see us! -Who?
old lady Callaway!
there's no ghost.
look at her!
she's nuts!
I won't go back.
I won't!
she's not the boss of me.
have you seen Alyssa?
I'm under strict orders not to tell you that she ran away.
why didn't you stop her?
I thought I'd give her a head start so she could reclaim a little dignity.
you'll make sure she comes home okay?
don't worry. Right away, boss.
Thanks, Vin.
it doesn't look haunted.
that's what they want you to think.
this isn't funny. Let's get out of here!
don't worry! She'll chicken out.
well...
...if it isn't the little orphan girl.
someone's home!
we were just coming after you.
I didn't mean nothing! It was just a joke.
I was just kidding around!
she didn't even scream.
let's get you ready for the big dinner.
big dinner?
listen, Lurch, you don't want me. I'm too skinny!
there are other kids.
big, fat ones, right outside. Eat them!
what in the world are you talking about?
the full moon. That's tonight, right?
old lady Callaway's ghost!
it's her!
I guess you think I'm stupid.
no, you're just a little upset. That's all.
looks like I just won five bucks.
so when's this party? Am I invited?
your dress is upstairs.
cocktails are at five.
now if you'll excuse me, please.
a dress?
me?
you got to be kidding!
nobody's even looking for me.
there you are!
I have been looking everywhere for you!
you have?
of course I have.
let me ask you a question.
you did not come all the way up here to sit around like a bump on a log, did you?
no.
I guess not.
come on, slugger. There playing football.
you're missing out on all the fun.
I thought, "Where is she? What's happened to her?
I hear Amanda's quite the jock. -The kid's a natural. Great speed.
student body, left. Everybody block for Amanda. On four. Ready?
who's Amanda?
funny.
she's probably eating her liver right now.
you think one camper's enough? I mean, what if she's still hungry?
look!
Hey, I got it!
run!
you're going the wrong way!
great speed.
bad sense of direction.
do you see what I see?
I don't know what you see. but what I see is me.
I see me, too.
does that mean there's two of you?
or two of me?
there really is two of us!
don't you find this odd?
no, this is weird. This is really, really weird.
wait a sec!
you live at the Callaway house!
you're that girl from camp!
they thought I was you!
Alyssa Callaway. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Amanda, Put her there!
no wonder that penguin guy asked me in!
that's Vincenzo. He's our butler.
who's the woman with the long hair?
I liked her.
that's Diane. We're buds. She's pretty cool for a grownup.
what were you doing over there?
I wanted to see what it was like to be an orphan.
what?
Why? -Because it looked like fun .
fun? Being an orphan? What's the matter with you?
so why were you at my house?
I was just...
I was just ringing the doorbell.
what for?
because kids think that place is haunted.
that's stupid.
well, then who's that scary blond lady?
she's absolutely horrid!
if I were you, I'd get rid of her. -Any suggestions?
you're talking to a pro here!
I've driven away more possible parents than you'll ever meet.
don't you want a family?
a girl's got to have her standards.
so tell me, this party. you really don't want to go?
I'd rather eat dirt.
okay, listen.
you be me, I'll be you. One night only.
tomorrow at noon, we switch back. What do you say?
that's wonderful! That way. You can scare off Clarice for me.
don't be such a goody-goody. I got a reputation to protect.
I scored a touchdown, didn't I?
okay, just don't talk so good.
use lousy English like:
ain't ya never gonna wanna doncha hafta go to the bathroom?
that sort of thing.
you ain't got nothing to worry about.
I say, you do catch on rather quickly.
stables, noon.
miss Kensington says fashionably late was an hour ago.
what's the problem?
I'm a hairdresser...
...not a zookeeper.
what in the name of God is going on here?
Hi, Vinnie. I mean, Vincenzo.
I got distracted.
you don't have to apologize.
Really?
cool!
I mean, it's just that I'm so terribly relieved that you aren't pissed.
pissed, miss?
why don't you get dressed, please? And let Carlo do your hair.
I liked it better when she fainted.
this is really good!
of course it is, silly. It's your favorite.
it is?
Yes, of course.
the big, gooey, messy burger.
also known as a sloppy joe.
sloppy joe, Right.
your favorite?
and with dern good reason!
did you just say " dern " ?
good evening.
how swell of you to come!
so nice to see you.
like my dress?
escargot, Miss Callaway?
why, thank you, waiter person.
I'm starving.
I mean, I'd adore one!
this tastes like a balloon.
it's snails, miss.
good.
nice.
chewy.
all this money and these people eat slugs!
look who's finally decided to grace us with her presence!
Clarice, right? You looked better with the mask.
I beg your pardon?
Clarice has been regaling us with your accomplishments at the academy.
might we entice you to play something? -Of course.
I'd be delighted! Whatever did you have in mind?
checkers?
dodge ball?
no, dear girl.
muffy was referring to the piano.
ladies and gentlemen. may I have your attention, please?
before we sit down to dinner. my future stepdaughter...
...whom I absolutely adore...
...has consented to play one of the pieces...
...that won her first prize at the Windsor Academy youth recital.
hold it! Time-out. I can't play the piano.
I just told them you would.
then do me a grand favor and untell them!
if you embarrass me in front of all these people...
...I'll make sure that you never play anything...
...ever again. Have I made myself clear?
clear as glass.
in fact, I can see right through you.
ladies and gentlemen.
normally, I'd be tickled to play a selection from Chopin.
but in honor of my new stepmother...
...whom I absolutely adore...
...I decided to play a little something of my own.
do you think my daughter's asking for attention?
I'd say she's demanding it.
Finn!
huckleberry Finn!
you got it!
the guys are ahead of us by eight seconds.
Amanda, it's your turn. Go, girl! -Me?
you're the best. Show them what you got.
look at her. She's nervous!
Yeah, so?
the old Amanda wasn't scared of nothing.
what am I supposed to do?
ready.
set.
go!
song!
what happened?
'London Bridge is Falling Down " !
that's it!
you may enter.
mind if we talk?
whatever about?
Clarice.
none of that.
she was upset with your performance. Shouldn't you give her a chance?
I did, and she's a big phoney-baloney. if you ask me.
I've never heard you this outspoken. It'd be nice to have a mother.
Yeah, and it'd be nice to have a father too. I mean
no, no. Sweetheart. I think the person you're really angry at...
...is me.
you?
What'd you do?
I haven't been much of a father lately. I haven't seen you.
but all that's going to change. Clarice is going back to the city.
gee, I hope it was nothing I did.
no, she's got a wedding to plan, but we'll get to spend some time together.
get to know each other again. Is that okay?
let's tuck you in. You little snuggler.
see you tomorrow.
good night, honey.
I like having a father.
I like having a daughter. Good night, sweetie.
lights out!
lights out, cabin three!
come on, come on. -This I got to see!
we're going to get caught. I just know it!
come on, Frankie. It's a full moon!
shut up, stupid! lombies hear better than dogs.
it's a frog!
Amanda? Scared of a frog? She's changed, all right!
now do you believe me?
Yeah, she's one of them pod people. Let's get out of here!
a frog?
you know what?
you should have kissed it.
he might've turned out to be Prince Charming.
grose!
not for you. For me!
you'd kiss a frog?
no.
toads are my specialty.
big, old, ugly suckers with tongues like this.
it is not. -It is too!
how else am I going to catch a guy? -I don't know.
there's that smile!
and that time. I think it went all the way up to your eyes.
you remind me of someone.
I do? Who?
someone I've never met.
how, if you've never met her?
sometimes when I dream. I think I see her.
you know, you've been acting just a little bit weirder today.
I think maybe it's all this fresh air.
don't make fun.
sorry.
usually you're such a tough guy.
don't tell anyone, okay?
Scout's honor.
I mean, after all, I wouldn't want to spoil my reputation none.
none.
I've got an idea.
let's go spy on the boys.
safe trip, honey.
Oh, my God!
how was the party?
well, the good news is Clarice is gone.
you did it!
the bad news is she'll be back in a week.
Oh, you didn't.
what's a cool guy like your dad doing with a witch like her?
it's too bad he didn't meet Diane first.
now, she's awesome.
Yeah, they'd be perfect for each other.
you're not thinking what I hope you're not thinking.
want to bet?
but he's getting married!
they got to meet once. Then they'll fall in love for sure.
how do you know?
because Diane says, when it happens. it happens like that.
okay, so look.
you go back to Diane and I'll go back to your dad.
wait! Why not the other way around?
you know what he likes. and I know what she likes.
they need all the help they can get.
but how will we get them together?
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
you're too tense. Relax.
I got 1. 000 pounds of animal under my butt, and she says, "Relax.
move with the horse and you'll be fine.
when did you become an expert all of a sudden?
ain't you never seen a Western?
honey, the last Western I saw was an omelet.
what happened to those equestrian classes you took?
are you asking me a question?
come on. I'll race you to the lake.
no, no. Slow is good.
I like to enjoy the scenery.
I got spurs that jingle jingle jangle
as I ride merrily along
we're doing a good job, aren't we?
I'm finally getting the hang of this.
I'm getting the hang of this!
Oh, come on, Amanda. My voice isn't that bad!
I been in the desert On a horse with no name
it's good to get out of the rain
not only is she an excellent rider. She's a gourmet cook...
...she paints...
...she speaks four languages...
you know, honey. You could learn a lot from Clarice.
Alyssa, there's a...
honey!
come here! Come here!
where is that girl?
did you bring it?
whoa, bud!
someone turn this thing off!
stop this right now! I'm telling you! Stop!
step on it!
Oh, dear! Oh, my god!
help me!
somebody help me!
hang on!
call 911 !
slow down.
don't talk to me! Talk to the horse!
I was talking to the horse!
okay, it's okay.
I'm on a killer! They gave me the killer horse!
relax.
you okay?
I about dropped my transmission back there.
if it's any consolation, I used to look like a real jerk on a horse.
how many fingers, cowboy?
six.
close enough. Can you stand?
which is more bruised. my butt or my ego?
have someone take a look at that.
my butt? -No.
that cut. Right there.
Oh, great.
we have first aid at the camp.
Oh, thanks. I just live over here.
are you Roger Callaway?
I think so. -The Roger Callaway?
from the Callaway Foundation?
Yeah, that's me.
I'm Diane Barrows. I always wanted to meet you. My kids love your camp.
you have kids?
they're not mine. I work for the East Side Children's Center.
of course.
it was nice to meet you, Mr. Callaway.
Roger, please.
and thank you for saving my life.
and you really should put some iodine on your butt.
cut.
miss Barrows...
I was wondering if I could offer you iced tea.
I'd love to hear more about the camp and how it's going.
only if we walk.
you took the words out of my mouth.
come on.
now hold still.
you certainly are an angel of mercy.
I see worse cuts than this every day. -Thanks.
my gang always invents new ways to get hurt.
you must really love children. -What's not to love?
no, really. -You big baby! Come here.
is that better?
I can't hear anything!
we've got to get closer!
you know, you're not at all what I expected.
Really?
what were you expecting?
blue blood, for one thing.
I thought you'd be some rich, big. old, fat geezer who smokes cigars.
Really?
I made my money the old-fashioned way. Pure dumb luck.
I doubt that.
I swear to God.
twelve years ago, a cell phone was something out of Star rreh.
but I thought it was pretty cool. so I bought airspace.
get out!
that's like money out of thin air!
you'll notice I don't carry one. I hate them.
excuse me.
miss Kensington, boss.
she insists.
excuse me. It's my-- Miss Kensington.
how you doing?
how am I doing?
please, honey, look.
do you have any idea what your daughter has done?
no, what? -She spit
gum? In your hair?
are you sure?
am I sure? Oh, my God! You should see it!
I'm certain it wasn't intentional.
look, of course. You've had a rough day.
rough is a broken nail, darling.
what I've had is a train wreck!
just try to calm down. I'll speak to her.
I'm just going to go now.
just one second. One second, please.
what? Is there a woman there with you?
Yes, there's sort of a woman here. She's from the camp.
how delightful! I'm in the middle of a crisis...
...and you're having a bachelor party!
I'm in a meeting. That's all.
it's just a meeting.
no, we're not going to have dinner. There's nothing going to go on
please. I'll see you at the end of the week.
me too. Bye-bye.
I'm so sorry.
sorry about that!
but she squeezed me so hard. it just sort of popped out.
I don't think she likes me much.
she's been looking forward to meeting you for months.
do you know how much she loves kids?
no. Do you?
well, you are the first kid I've ever seen her with.
but I'm sure it's a bunch.
and you love her, right?
like that " Can't eat. can't sleep. reach for the stars over the fence. World Series " kind of stuff?
is that what the dictionary says?
you're marrying her because Alyssa needs. I mean...
...I need a mother?
I think that's enough questions for today.
wait.
I only got one left.
let's have it.
who was that pretty woman out on the patio?
the Roger Callaway?
on a white horse, no less.
so?
he comes riding up, saves my life.
he's probably worth billions. Totally cute.
Oh, my God! He is so cute.
to top it all off...
...he's, honest to God, a nice guy.
I'm stupid enough to think he's available.
isn't he? -No.
is too.
how would you know?
was he wearing a ring?
even if he was available， he wouldn't be interested in me.
don't put yourself down.
guys like him like girls with food names.
cookie, Muffin...
...Candy.
they don't marry girls like me.
he did once.
is this published somewhere?
her name was Cathy. She wasn't a food, but a teacher.
he's even more perfect than I thought.
I'm cheating. Give me one of those.
give me that stick.
Vincenzo, do you believe in magic?
like card tricks?
no, sparks between two people.
it happens when you least expect it.
why do you ask?
no reason.
it's been so long since Cathy and...
I didn't think it'd happen again.
that Miss Kensington is really something.
well, actually...
...that's not who I meant.
I know.
you're my best man. You're supposed to come up with words of wisdom now.
why don't you go for a drive?
see where you end up.
now, where's he going?
it's the home office.
the Butkises want Amanda. The paperwork just went through.
who the hell is this?
Diane Barrows, Since when does your department okay an adoption...
...without the caseworker's report?
I know these people are nice.
have you ever met those people?
these people collect kids. They'll take anybody.
where is Diane Barrows?
I think she's in the office.
let me just run this by you one more time.
just hear me out one more time.
I know I don't make that much money. And I know I'm a little bit single.
but I want to adopt Amanda.
are you laughing at me? He's laughing at me!
you stupid jerk!
what?
Oh, it's you.
is this a bad time?
a bad time?
for a meeting?
no. I'm having a problem with one of my kids.
anything I can do?
you've already saved my life. What can I do for you?
I want to apologize for yesterday.
it was very rude. I shouldn't have taken that call.
I'd like to make it up.
okay, then give me your car.
perhaps we could discuss it at a pizza joint I saw in town.
I'm sorry. I can't.
I understand. Maybe some other time, then.
no, it's not like that.
I'm on duty today in the mess hall. It's my kids' turn to serve.
Oh, I see.
if your heart's set on Italian. you could join us.
we're having...
...macaroni and cheese.
and peach cobbler?
Oh, yeah, All you can eat.
darling, Craig can meet the president on Sunday.
I need bridesmaids!
you must come.
fabulous!
there's my other line. Love you. Mean it. Ciao.
why do you keep bothering me with numbers? It's my wedding.
whatever it costs, just get it!
it's a cozy little spot!
when were you last here?
it must be 10 years!
ten years?
did you build the camp and never come back?
no, it was my wife's idea. She had a big heart.
had?
she passed away when Alyssa was born.
sorry.
I just never could come back. Until now, that is.
here you go!
Hey, Carmen. Where's Amanda?
I don't know. One minute she's behind me...
would you get her? I want to introduce her to somebody.
I'm having the hardest time keeping tabs on her. She keeps running off.
tell me about it. I got one just like her at home.
what are you doing?
I'm cleaning this window. Look at it. It's filthy.
Diane wants to see you. Come on.
Hey, my hat!
do something, Alyssa!
here she comes.
my compliments to the chef.
Amanda, take that thing off.
let her keep it on. It might be the latest thing.
excuse me, madam.
did you just snort?
I suppose you think this is funny?
well, maybe you'll get a little chuckle out of this.
you wouldn't dare!
food fight!
that was great!
I couldn't have done it better myself.
I almost had a heart attack.
I guess that's what they mean by " eat and run. "
we need doggie bags.
Oh, dear. Look at me. I am covered in cobbler.
you look good in peach.
leave it. I may still be hungry.
I can't believe you hit me with the butter.
I didn't start it. You just talk to that short-order cook of yours.
Oh yeah. Where is she, anyway?
look at your head.
if you want to get cleaned up. there's showers over there.
I've got a better idea. Will you excuse me?
and maybe hold some of that? Pardon me.
what's wrong with him?
beats me. I've never seen him act like this.
I think he's gone mental.
he's got a lot on his mind.
don't you know not to swim after you eat?
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
I got a cramp!
I can't swim!
no fair. I saved you.
it's too cold.
I'm not going in there.
come on! I don't want to save you right now.
all right, buster. You better be worth it.
you're not funny.
Oh, my God!
say...
...a guy could drown waiting for you.
callaway, I'm going to kill you!
Roger, I am going to kill you!
it's working.
look at them.
now that's more like it.
Roger, darling? Anyone home?
miss Kensington! What a surprise. We weren't expecting you.
Yes, I know. Where's Roger?
Mr. Callaway is out for the afternoon.
I see.
would you please tell him I wish to speak with him?
Yes, madam.
thank you so much.
I'd like a Diet Coke.
one Diet Coke, coming up.
with lime.
awfully early in the day to be looking at stars.
what do we have here?
you can't always be this much fun. It wouldn't be fair.
trust me.
I haven't done this in years.
well, it feels good.
it feels better every second.
don't move. -Why?
there's a thing.
what do you mean "a thing"?
a bug?
a dreaded maraschino bug.
it's highly poisonous.
and you wanted to go for pizza.
I almost didn't come over at all.
I'm glad you did.
what was that?
it's a sign. -What do you mean "a sign"?
I don't know.
I think I know what you mean.
it's your Miss Kensington, right?
I'm getting married next month.
well, of course you are!
so what was this? Just sort of a last fling?
I didn't know. I was hoping to find out.
don't worry about it. I can help you out.
it was nice to meet you.
and thanks for the camp.
Oh, by the way, congratulations!
Diane, please.
you know what?
this just kills me.
we might've hit this one out of the park.
it was there, I know it.
that "can't eat. can't sleep...
...reach for the stars. over the fence...
...World Series" kind of thing.
Oh, well.
I've got to get a dictionary.
they were so close!
grownups, they think too much.
I give up.
no, we mustn't!
and why mustn't we?
because third time's a charm. Right?
right.
boss!
it's Miss Kensington.
Thanks. I'll take it down here.
not here.
up there.
up there?
afraid so.
Roger, darling!
Clarice! Your hair. You're here!
what did you do? Fall in the lake?
it's the funniest thing-- Shouldn't you be in New York?
I couldn't bear to be away a moment longer.
you were just gone a day.
I know! And I was positively miserable the entire time.
so I've decided we mustn't wait another day.
to what?
to be married, silly. Next month seems like an eternity.
when two people are as much in love as we...
...I say. " What's wrong with tomorrow " ?
tomorrow?
darling, you haven't said a word about my hair.
okay, listen to this.
dear Roger. You are so totally fresh.
just thinking about you drives me mental.
meet me where we met with the horses.
seven clock tonight. Love, Diane.
how's that?
very romantic.
want to hear mine?
'dear Diane...
dear Diane, ever since I saw you riding the horse...
...I can't stop thinking about it.
and I know we were disturbed at the lake...
...but I must see you again where I saved your life, at 7: 30.
yours truly, Roger Callaway.
there you are, my little gum-chewing assailant.
you're back!
what? No big hug " hello " ?
you're not supposed to be here. -ln a perfect world, neither are you.
we're leaving for the city.
right now? It's too soon!
maybe I didn't make myself clear.
we're leaving tonight.
this little act of yours is getting old.
what act?
Oh, please.
when I was your age. I'd been through three stepmothers.
I know all the lengths girls go through to keep Daddy all to themselves.
you got that all wrong, lady.
Alyssa, don't be rude. I'm talking.
where was I?
Oh, yes.
you had Roger to yourself for nine wonderful years.
but after tomorrow. I'm the woman of the house.
and you're off to a year-round boarding school.
possibly in Tibet.
did you say tomorrow?
should I have come here?
Yes, stupid.
he's only worth about $20 billion. for God's sakes!
great! Now I'm just after him for his money.
how shallow is that?
I liked him before I knew he was rich.
so I should've come here.
he's a little bit engaged.
I've never met her. so maybe that doesn't count.
come on, ladies. Perk up.
come on, Amanda!
we're missing the fireworks!
this is Miss Van Dyke from Children's Services.
hello there.
I believe I have some very good news for you.
come to Mama, sweetheart!
I feel pretty ding-dang-dong stupid.
but my name's Amanda!

you could've slit their tires! Anything!
they had paperwork.
what paperwork?

I would have.

...finally lands her man.
now, these nincompoops are your new brothers and sisters.
from the left, you got...
...Bubba, Bridget, Brenda...

...and little Harry. Jr.
now, he's ours.
there's been a big mistake.
you see, my name is not Amanda.
we know that, honey.

sure. And you will never have to be Amanda again.
that's right. Because from now on. you're going to be Little Betty Butkis.

isn't that going to be fun?
callaway residence.

Hello, this is Miss Callaway.
I can't talk long. It's me.

are those guys scary or what?
what happened yesterday?
are you sitting down?
Yeah, kind of.
Clarice moved up the wedding.
your dad's getting married...
...in two hours and 1 2 minutes.
what do we do now? -I don't know.
but it'll have to be something major.
and quick.
you've got to get me out of here.
these people aren't just scary, they're
new kids aren't allowed to use the phone. Butkis rules.
Hey, Vin. You've been taking care of Alyssa all her life, right?
Oh, no, Alyssa. Not again.
answer the question.
Yes. From the day she was-- From the day you were born.
so you know pretty well everything about her?

broken bottle sliding into home.
this one?
rusty nail right through my shoe.
bled for six blocks.
how about here?
ever seen this?
when was that?
Roman candle last Fourth of July. Right in the head.
my God!
you're not Alyssa!
Nope. Name's Amanda.
put her there.
identical strangers?
holy mackerel, it's amazing!
Yeah. And it's weird too.
but if you're here with us. then Alyssa is...
ln a lot of trouble.
I got to tell Mr. Callaway. -Oh, no.
wait! You can't tell him yet.
we got to get him to see Diane before the wedding.
they'll fall in love. and Clarice will be history.
where the hell is everybody?
I sure hope you got a plan.
what are you doing here?
I came for Mr. Callaway's daughter. Alyssa.
you got her.
I want her back.
what are you talking about?
I don't have her. I don't even know her.
Yes, you do.
this is Alyssa Callaway.
no, you'd better get your eyes checked because...
...this is a little girl named Amanda.
this is your Amanda.
Oh, my God!
look, they're identical.
this is amazing.
Yeah. And it's weird too.
I understand...
...that through some simple mix-up...
...that Alyssa is in the care of Child Services.
I've been authorized to tell you...
...that if I get her back. there'll be no legal entanglements.
she's not exactly with me here.
she's been...
well, she was adopted.
then you better un-adopt her quick.
Mr. Callaway's getting married in 90 minutes.
he's expecting his real daughter there.
ninety minutes?
I can't get to Staten Island and back in 90 minutes.
well, could I suggest that you go really, really fast?
here.
if you get into any trouble...
...call this number.
ask for Lou.
Lou who?
well, hey. Look at this mess.
clean it up.
you clean it.
put a cork in it, okay? He's management.
my father's Roger Callaway...
...and when he finds out what you're doing here...
...he's going to buy this whole town and kick you out of it.
Roger Callaway? Then how come you ain't at his wedding?
come on, Diane. You can do it.
we might have to stall a bit.
how?
how should I know?
you're the brains of this operation.
I must be crazy. But I am not going in that church.
no matter what happens. I am not going in that church.
it's only natural to be nervous.
I was thinking about the World Series. -Baseball?
did you ever hit a home run?
not recently.
you know when it's bottom of the ninth...
...the bases are loaded...
...and you know the next one's coming right down the middle?
and then...
...you just connect.
and for an instant...
...you know that it's going over the fence and out of the park...
...further than you could ever imagine.
Yeah, that's a great feeling.
Clarice hates baseball.
come on, Sea Biscuit. Don't fail me now.
Hello! Hello!

central Park close enough?
central Park? The Central Park?

Cho-won
I love you

I don't see it happening
he hit the ceiling when I asked him to meet you
why doesn't he like you?
you'll make a great mom
I'm sorry you wasted money on this pizza
we can meet behind his back
if you feel like anything just call me
you have my number
but you're not marrying me
don't you have self-esteem?
Cho-won, well have fun together Just you and me, Okay?
I guess this is what they call Karma - Eat some - You can have it all
seeing you eat makes me full
do me a favor
can you buy me one to go?
I don't feel good eating this without my dad
he loves pizza, too - Sure - Thanks!
I don't understand why he doesn't like you
Jul-gu says you look yummy - God, I'm pissed! - Are you okay?
I'm all wet

I'm quite dirty, huh?
no - Really?
you're almost too clean

can I ask you something?
what?
how come you have no testicles?
what? Well...
I don't really...
I know!
girls don't have testicles but tits!
dad likes girls with big tits - You want me to scrub your back? - Sure
I do daddys
especially the birthmark on her back
why aren't you scrubbing it?
you have a mole on your back
I heard my mom had one, too
she did?
you've got no dead skin
neither does my dad - Then you can stop - No
I've always wanted to scrub my mom's back
your tits are suffocating me!
stop it!
chul-soo, I'm really sorry
I know how you feel Try to understand her
that's right You should understand her
after all, she gave birth to him
it's natural for her to want to be with him
can't you see that?
that's right - Shut up!
leave my poor Chul-soo alone
chul-soo, cheer up
take that job I got you and live happily with him
it breaks my heart to see you in pain
don't be too sad, Lee-soo

if I were you I'd never leave a guy like him
Chul-soo sent me these?
Chul-soo...
do you have any idea why he hides his feelings from you?
I do...
it's not because he hates you
he doesn't want to be a burden on you
that's how nice he is
and you...
what's your relation to him?
it's a secret

does it hurt a lot?
I'm sorry I'll never get into a fight
please don't leave me alone
dad!
dad...
Cho-won, why are you crying? Where am l?
who are you?
Cho-won
Where's my bag?
all these years
I've administered countless marriages of my students
however, this is surely the most impressive, touching one
Why?
as you all already know
the bride and groom met back in high school
and they did it like rabbits day and night
know what I mean?
like rabbits? God!
he couldn't recognize his mom
he couldn't call her Mom
What'd he do to deserve that?
I'm talking about that boy!
anyway, this beautiful couple gives us a very precious lesson
which is... Kids shouldn't have kids!
they have sex without protection and get knocked up
what's happening to this society?
legend tells of a legendary warrior...
whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend.
he traveled the land in search of worthy foes.
I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist!
the warrior said nothing, for his mouth was full.
then he swallowed. And then he spoke.
enough talk. Let's fight!
Shashabooey!
he was so deadly in fact, that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness.
my eyes! - He's too awesome!
and attractive. - How can we repay you?
there is no charge for awesomeness.
or attractiveness.
kablooey!
it mattered not how many foes he faced.
they were no match for his bodacity!
never before had a panda been so feared! And so loved.
even the most heroic heroes in China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master.
we should hang out.
agreed.
but hanging out would have to wait.
because when you're facing the 10, 000 demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters and that's...
Po! Get up!
you'll be later for work!
what?
Po! Get up!
Po. What are you doing up there?
nothing.
monkey! Mantis! Orane! Viper! Tigress!
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.
coming!
sorry, Dad.
sorry doesn't make the noodles.
what were you doing up there? All that noise.
nothing. I just had a crazy dream.
about what?
what were you dreaming about?
what was I...?
l was dreaming about...
noodles.
noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles?
Yeah. What else would l be dreaming about?
careful! That soup is sharp.
Oh, happy day!
my son, finally having the noodle dream!
you don't know how long l've been waiting for this moment.
this is a sign, Po.
a sign of what?
you are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my Secret lngredient Soup.
then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant!
as l took it over from my father, who took it over from his father...
who won it from a friend in mahjong.
dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.
no, it was the dream.
we are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins.
but, Dad, didn't you ever want to do something else?
something besides noodles?
actually, when l was young and crazy, l thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.
why didn't you?
because it was a stupid dream.
can you imagine me making tofu?
tofu.
No! We all have our place in this world.
mine is here, and yours is...
l know, is here.
no, it's at tables 2, 5,7, and 12
service with a smile.
well done, students... If you were trying to disappoint me.
Tigress, you need more ferocity! Monkey, greater speed.
Orane, height. Viper, subtlety. Mantis...
lt's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.
master Oogway, you summoned me? ls something wrong?
why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?
so, nothing's wrong?
well, l didn't say that.
you were saying?
l have had a vision.
Tai Lung will return.
that is impossible! He is in prison.
nothing is impossible.
Zeng!
fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons, double everything!
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!
Yes, Master Shifu!
one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
we must do something! We can't let him march on the valley, take his revenge!
he'll...
your mind is like this water, my friend.
when it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see.
but if you allow it to settle...
the answer becomes clear.
the Dragon Scroll.
lt is time.
but who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power?
to become the Dragon Warrior?
l don't know.
excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.
watch it!
sorry. - Suck it up!
sorry. - A thousand pardons.
what?
master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today!
everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!
we've waited 1, 000 years for this! Take the bowl!
this is the greatest day in kung fu history! Just go!
Po! Where are you going?
to the Jade Palace.
you're forgetting your noodle cart.
the whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them.
selling noodles?
but, Dad, l was thinking, maybe l...
yeah? - l was thinking maybe l...
could also sell the bean buns. They're about to go bad.
that's my boy!
l told you that dream was a sign.
Yeah. Glad l had it.
l'm a kung fu warrior! - Me, too!
there's spots at the top. - Let's go.
come on. Come on!
almost there.
what?
No! Oh, no!
sorry, Po. - We'll bring you back a souvenir.
no. l'll bring me back a souvenir.
lt is an historic day.
lsn't it, Master Oogway?
Yes, and one l feared l would not live to see.
are your students ready?
Yes, Master Oogway.
know this, old friend.
whomever l choose will not only bring peace to the valley...
but also to you. Let the tournament begin!
let the tournament begin!
no, no, wait!
l'm coming! Wait, wait!
Hey! Open the door!
let me in!
Oitizens of the Valley of Peace, it is my great honor to present to you...Tigress!
Viper! Orane! Monkey! Mantis!
the Furious Five!
Yeah, the Furious Five!
warriors, prepare!
wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.
ready for battle! - Yeah.
the Thousand Tongues of Fire.
look at that.
Hey! Get out of the way!
and finally Master Tigress!
and believe me, citizens, you have not seen anything yet.
l know!
master Tigress! Face lron Ox and his Blades of Death.
l sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.
Oitizens of the Valley of Peace,
master Oogway will now choose the Dragon Warrior!
Oh, no! No, no, wait!
Yeah.
Po!
what are you doing?!
what does it look like l'm doing?! Stop!
l'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!
but l don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream!
l lied. l don't dream about noodles, Dad.
l love kung fu!
come on, son. Let's get back to work.
OK.
what's going on?
Where...?
what are you pointing...?
OK. Sorry.
l just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.
how interesting.
master, are you pointing at me?
the universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!
what? - What?!
What?! - What?!
stop, wait! Who told you to...?
master Oogway, wait.
that flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to our problem.
you were about to point at Tigress and that thing fell in front of her!
that was just an accident!
there are no accidents.
forgive us, Master. We have failed you.
no. lf the panda has not quit by morning then l will have failed you.
wait! Wait, wait, wait! l bring a message...
from Master Shifu.
What?!
double the guard?!
extra precautions?!
your prison may not be adequate?!
you doubt my prison security?!
absolutely not.
Shifu does. l'm just the messenger.
l'll give you a message for your Master Shifu.
escape from Chorh-Gom prison is impossible!
lmpressive, isn't it?
lt's very impressive.
lt's very impressive.
one way in, one way out.
one thousand guards and one prisoner.
Yes, except that prisoner...
is Tai Lung.
take us down.
what are you doing?
Oh, my.
behold Tai Lung.
l'm just gonna wait right here.
lt's nothing to worry about. lt's perfectly safe.
crossbows! At the ready!
Crossbows?
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.
don't get him mad.
what's he gonna do about it? l've got him completely immobilized.
did l step on the little kitty's tail?
l'm good. l've seen enough.
l'll tell Shifu he has nothing to worry about.
no, he doesn't.
l'll tell him that.
can we please go now?
dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
wait a second!
l think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that l'm...
the Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!
look at this place.
master Flying Rhino's armor, with authentic battle damage!
the Sword of Heroes!
said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking.
the lnvisible Trident of Destiny!
l've only seen paintings of that painting.
No!
the legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors.
said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu Army.
hello.
have you finished sight-seeing?
sorry, l should have come to you first.
my patience is wearing thin.
well, l mean, it's not like you were going anywhere.
would you turn around? - Sure.
how's it going?
how do you get 5, 000... Master Shifu!
someone... broke that.
but l'll fix it. Do you have some...
glue?
a splinter.
so you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?
l guess so. - Wrong!
you are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until...
you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.
so, how does this work?
do you have a ladder, or a trampoline, or...?
you think it's that easy? That l'll just hand you the secret - to limitless power? - No, l...
one must first master the highest level of kung fu.
and that is impossible if that one is someone like you.
someone like me?
Yes, look at you! This fat butt! Flabby arms!
those are sensitive in the flabby parts.
and this ridiculous belly.
and utter disregard for personal hygiene.
now, wait a minute. That's uncalled for.
don't stand that close. l can smell your breath.
listen, Oogway said l was...
the Wuxi Finger Hold. Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!
Oh, you know this hold?
developed by Master Wuxi in the Third Dynasty.
then you know what happens when l flex my pinky.
no, no! - You know the hardest part of this?
the hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.
OK, OK, take it easy.
now listen closely, panda.
Oogway may have picked you, but when l'm through with you, l promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear?
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.
good.
l can't wait to get started.
let's begin. - Wait, wait, wait.
what?
now? - Yes, now.
unless the great Oogway was wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior.
Oh, OK, well...
l don't know if l can do all of those moves.
well, if we don't try, we'll never know, will we?
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level.
what level is that?
well, l'm not a master, but...
let's just start at zero. Level zero.
no. There is no such thing as level zero.
maybe l can start with that. - That?
we use that for training children and propping the door open when it's hot.
but if you insist...
the Furious Five!
you're bigger than your action figures. Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.
go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do.
are they gonna watch, or should l wait till they get back to work?
hit it.
OK, yeah. l mean, l just ate. So l'm still digesting.
so my kung fu might not be as good as... later on.
just hit it.
all right.
what you got? You got nothing,'cause l got it right here.
you picking on my friends? Get ready to feel thunder.
l'm coming at you with crazy feet.
come on. l'm a blur. You've never seen bear style.
you've only seen praying mantis.
or monkey style.
or l could come at you snickety-snake.
would you hit it!
all right. All right.
why don't you try again? A little harder.
how's that?
that hurts.
this will be easier than l thought.
I'm feeling a little nauseous!
those are hard!
my tenders.
how did l do?
there is now a level zero.
there's no words. - No denying that.
what was Master Oogway thinking?
the poor guy's gonna get himself killed.
he is so mighty!
the Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire!
when he walks, the very ground shakes!
one would think Master Oogway would choose someone who knew kung fu.
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.
or even see his toes.
OK.
great.
Hi. You're up.
l am now.
l was just...
some day, huh?
that kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Are your biceps sore?
l've had a long and rather disappointing day, so...
Yeah, l should probably get to sleep now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. - OK, thanks.
lt's just... Man, l'm such a big fan!
you guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River.
outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop. You just...
sorry about that.
look, you don't belong here.
l know. l know. You're right.
I don't have... I just...
my whole life l dreamed of...
no, l meant you don't belong here. l mean, in this room. This is my room.
property of Orane.
OK. Right, right.
so, you want to get to sleep.
Yeah. - l'm keeping you up.
we got big things tomorrow.
all right. You're awesome. Last thing l'm gonna say. Bye-bye.
what was that?
l didn't say anything.
OK. All right. Good night.
sleep well.
that seemed a little awkward.
master Tigress! l didn't mean to wake you.
you don't belong here. - Yeah, of course.
this is your room.
l mean, you don't belong in the Jade Palace.
you're a disgrace to kung fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning.
big fan!
l see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
ls that what this is? Sorry. l thought it was just a regular peach tree.
l understand. You eat when you are upset.
upset? l'm not upset. What makes you think l'm upset.
so why are you so upset?
l probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu.
ln the history of China. ln the history of sucking!
probably.
and the Five! Man, you should've seen them! They totally hate me.
totally.
how is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior?
l mean, l'm not like the Five.
l've got no claws, no wings, no venom.
even Mantis has those... thingies.
maybe l should just quit and go back to making noodles.
quit, don't quit.
noodles, don't noodles.
you are too concerned with what was and what will be.
there's a saying:
yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift.
that is why it is called the present.
Oh, no! - What's happening?!
to your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!
fire crossbows!
fire!
fire!
Tai Lung is free! l must warn Shifu.
not going anywhere! Neither is he! - Let go of me!
bring it up!
wait! Bring it back!
he's coming this way! - He won't get far. Archers!
we're dead. So very, very dead.
not yet we're not. Now!
can we run now? - Yes.
l'm glad Shifu sent you.
l was beginning to think l'd been forgotten.
fly back there and tell them...
the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
good morning, Master!
panda!
panda!
wake up!
he's quit.
what do we do now, with the panda gone? Who will be the Dragon Warrior?
all we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.
what are you doing here?!
Hi! Good morning, Master!
l thought l'd warm up a little.
you're stuck.
stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?
Nah. This is one of my... Yeah, l'm stuck.
help him. - Oh, dear.
maybe on three. One, two...
three.
thank you. - Don't mention it.
no, really, l appreciate... - Ever.
you actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night?
lt takes years to develop one's flexibility!
and years longer to apply it in combat!
put that down!
the only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
Yeah! Excellent.
let's get started.
are you ready? - l was born re...
l'm sorry, brother. l thought you said you were ready.
that was awesome! Let's go again!
l've been taking it easy on you, panda.But no more.
your next opponent will be me.
all right! Yeah, let's go!
step forth.
the true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness...
and make him suffer for it.
Oh, yeah!
to take his strength and use it against him...
until he finally falls...or quits...
a real warrior never quits.
don't worry, Master. l will never quit!
lf he's smart, he won't come back up those steps.
but he will.
he's not going to quit, is he?
he's not going to quit bouncing, l'll tell you that.
l thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.
trust me, it will.
lt's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this...
fat? - Fur. l was going to say fur.
sure you were.
who am l to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me.
l'm over here.
maybe you should look at this again.
Oh, OK.
stop it. Stop!
l know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all...
but if l didn't know better, l'd say he was trying to get rid of me.
l know he can seem kind of heartless...
but he wasn't always like that.
according to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.
No! - Yes.
but that was before.
before what?
before Tai Lung.
we're not really supposed to talk about him.
well, if he's going to stay here, he should know.
guys, guys, l know about Tai Lung.
he was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.
and then he turned bad, and now he's in jail.
he wasn't just a student.
Shifu found him as a cub...
and he raised him as his son.
and when the boy showed talent in kung fu...
Shifu trained him.
he believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.
lt was never enough for Tai Lung.
he wanted the Dragon Scroll.
but Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.
outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley.
he tried to take the scroll by force.
and Shifu had to destroy what he had created.
but how could he?
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before.
or since.
and now he has a chance to make things right.
to train the true Dragon Warrior.
and he's stuck with you.
a big fat panda who treats it like a joke.
that is it!
wait! My fault! l accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.
and may have also stopped his heart.
lnner peace.
lnner peace.
lnner...
lnner peace.
would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?!
lnner...
Oh, Zeng.
excellent.
l could use some good news right now.
master! Master!
l have... lt's...lt's very bad news.
Shifu.
there is just news. There is no good or bad.
master, your vision. Your vision was right.
Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way.
that is bad news...
if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
the panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.
he wasn't meant to be here! lt was an accident.
there are no accidents.
Yes, l know. You've said that already.
twice. - Well, that was no accident, either.
thrice.
my old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control.
lllusion?
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.
l cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time.
but there are things we can control.
l can control when the fruit will fall.
and l can control...
where to plant the seed.
that is no illusion, Master.
Yes.
but no matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree.
you may wish for an apple or an orange, but you will get a peach.
but a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
maybe it can.
lf you are willing to guide it.
to nurture it.
to believe in it.
but how? How?
l need your help, Master.
no, you just need to believe.
promise me, Shifu.
promise me you will believe.
l will try.
good.
my time has come.
you must continue your journey without me.
what are you...? Wait!
master!
you can't leave me!
you must believe.
master!
that was scary. - Yeah, so I'm like... "Fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province..."
but you're a lousy tipper.
Really? So how did you get out of there alive?
l mean, l didn't actually say that...
but l thought it...
in my mind.
lf he could read my mind, he'd be, like, " What? "
order up! Hope you like it.
this is really good! - No, come on.
try my dad's Secret lngredient Soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient.
what do you mean? This is amazing!
you're a really good cook. - l wish my mouth was bigger.
Tigress, you've got to try this.
lt is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe.
l guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet.
l'm gonna need a lot more than dew and universe juice.
what? - Nothing... Master Shifu.
never be the Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!
what is that noise you're making? Laughter? l never heard of it!
work hard, panda, and maybe someday...
you will have ears like mine.
that's good.
ears. lt's not working for you? l thought they were pretty good.
lt's Shifu!
of course it's Shifu. What do you think l'm doing?
master Shifu!
you think this is funny?
Tai Lung has escaped and you're acting like children!
what? - He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him.
and l was saying you got no sense of humor.
l'm gonna...stop Tai Lung.
what? You're serious? And l have to...?
master Oogway will stop him, like he did before.
Oogway cannot!
not anymore.
our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.
the panda? - Yes, the panda!
master, let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for.
No! lt is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung.
lt is his!
Where'd he go?
you cannot leave! A real warrior never quits.
watch me.
come on.
how am l supposed to beat Tai Lung? l can't even beat you to the stairs.
you will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior.
you don't believe that. You never believed that.
from the beginning, you've tried to get rid of me.
Yes! l was.
but now l ask you to trust in your master as l have come to trust in mine.
you're not my master. And l'm not the Dragon Warrior.
then why didn't you quit?! You knew l wanted you gone, yet you stayed.
Yeah, l stayed.
l stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said l smelled, it hurt, but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me.
l stayed because l thought, if anyone could change me...
could make me... not me...
it was you.
the greatest kung fu teacher in all of China!
but l can change you!
l can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And l will!
come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now.
even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you...
gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior?
how?
how?
how?! - l don't know!
l don't know.
that's what l thought.
this is what you trained me for.
Tigress!
don't try and stop me.
we're not trying to stop you.
what?
we're coming with you!
what? l eat when l'm upset, OK?
no need to explain.
l thought you might be Monkey. He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf.
don't tell Monkey.
look at you. - Yeah, l know, l disgust you.
no, l mean, how did you get up there?
l don't know. l guess that...
l don't know. l was getting a cookie.
yet you are ten feet off the ground.
and you have done a perfect spilt.
no, this? This is just...
an accident.
there are no accidents.
come with me.
l know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fuey...
but could you at least tell me where we're going?
you dragged me...
all the way out here...
for a bath?
Panda...
we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears.
the Pool of...
this is where Oogway unraveled the mysteries...
of harmony and focus.
this is the birthplace...
of kung fu.
do you want to learn kung fu?
Yeah!
then l am your master!
OK!
don't cry.
OK.
when you focus on kung fu, when you concentrate...
you stink.
perhaps that is my fault.
l cannot train you the way l have trained the Five.
l now see that the way to get through to you...
is with this.
Oh, great,'cause l am hungry.
good.
when you have been trained, you may eat.
let us begin.
after you, panda.
just like that?
no sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?
l vowed to train you, and you have been trained. You are free to eat.
enjoy.
Hey!
l said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling.
Hey!
you are free to eat.
am l?! - Are you?!
l'm not hungry.
master.
cut it!
Where's the Dragon Warrior?
how do you know you're not looking at her?
you think l'm a fool?
l know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you!
l heard how he fell out of the sky in a ball of fire.
that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.
Po? - So that is his name. Po.
finally, a worthy opponent.
our battle will be legendary!
we've got this. Help her.
monkey!
go!
what was I thinking?
Mantis!
now!
Shifu taught you well.
but he didn't teach you everything.
you have done well, panda.
done well? Done well?
l've done awesome!
the mark of a true hero is humility.
but, yes, you have done...
awesome.
guys? Guys?! They're dead!
no, they're breathing. They're asleep? But their eyes are open.
we were no match for his nerve attach.
he's gotten stronger.
who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
he's too fast!
sorry, Po.
l thought we could stop him.
he could have killed you.
why didn't he?
so you could come back and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work.
lt might. l mean, a little.
l'm pretty scared.
you can defeat him, panda!
are you kidding? lf they can't?!
they're five masters. l'm just one me.
but you will have the one thing that no one else does.
you really believe l'm ready?
you are...
Po.
behold the Dragon Scroll.
lt is yours.
wait. What happens when l read it?
legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat.
Really? That's cool.
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.
you will feel the universe in motion around you.
can l punch through walls?
do a quadruple back flip? - Focus.
will l? - Focus.
focus. - Oh, yeah, yeah.
read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.
read it and become...
the Dragon Warrior.
lt's impossible to open.
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.
thank you.
l probably loosened it up for you though.
OK, here goes.
lt's blank. - What?!
here, look. - No, l am forbidden to look upon...
blank. l don't...
l don't understand.
OK. So, like...
Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all.
no. Oogway was wiser than us all.
Oh, come on! Face it, he picked me by accident.
of course l'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am l kidding?
but who will stop Tai Lung?
he'll destroy everything and everyone.
no.
evacuate the valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.
what about you, Master? - l will fight him.
what? - l can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.
but, Shifu, he'll kill you.
then l will finally have paid for my mistake.
listen to me, all of you.
lt is time for you to continue your journey without me.
l am very proud to have been your master.
we've got to get them out safely.
come, little one. Let's find your mama.
viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north.
Orane, light the way.
look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
Hey, Dad.
Po!
good to have you back, son.
good to be back.
let's go, Po.
so for our next shop, it's time to face it...
the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables...
no longer slices.
also, l was thinking, maybe this time we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in.
you like that?
Po, l'm sorry if things didn't work out.
lt just wasn't meant to be.
Po, forget everything else.
your destiny still awaits.
we are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins.
l don't know, Dad.
honestly, sometimes l can't believe l'm actually your son.
Po...
l think it's time l told you something l should have told you...
a long time ago.
OK.
the secret ingredient of my Secret lngredient Soup.
come here. The secret ingredient is...
nothing.
you heard me. Nothing!
there is no secret ingredient!
wait, wait. lt's just plain old noodle soup?
you don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
don't have to. To make something special, you just believe it's special.
there is no secret ingredient.
l have come home, Master.
this is no longer your home. And l am no longer your master.
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.
so where is this Po?
did l scare him off?
this battle is between you and me.
so, that is how it's going to be.
that is how it must be.
l rotted in jail for 20 years because of your weakness!
obeying your master is not weakness!
you knew l was the Dragon Warrior.
you always knew.
but when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do?
what did you do?!
nothing!
you were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault!
not your fault?!
who filled my head with dreams?!
who drove me to train until my bones cracked?!
who denied me my destiny?!
lt was never my decision to make!
lt is now.
give me the scroll!
l would rather die.
all l ever did, l did to make you proud!
tell me how proud you are, Shifu!
tell me!
tell me!
l have... l have always been proud of you.
from the first moment, l've been...
proud of you.
and it was my pride...
that blinded me.
l loved you too much to see what you were becoming...
what l...
was turning you into.
l'm...
l'm sorry.
l don't want your apology.
l want my scroll!
What?!
where is it?!
dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now.
you will never see that scroll, Tai Lung.
never.
never.
stairs.
who are you?
buddy, l am the Dragon Warrior.
you?
him? He's a panda.
you're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?
don't tempt me.
no. l'm gonna use this.
you want it? Come and get it.
Finally!
that scroll is mine!
lightning!
the scroll has given him power!
No!
Finally! Oh, yes.
the power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!
lt's nothing!
lt's OK. l didn't get it the first time, either.
what?
there is no secret ingredient.
lt's just you.
stop it!
l'm gonna pee.
don't.
don't! Don't!
you...
can't defeat me.
you...
you're just a big...
fat...
panda!
l'm not a big fat panda.
l'm the big fat panda.
the Wuxi Finger Hold!
Oh, you know this hold?
you're bluffing. You're bluffing. Shifu didn't teach you that.
Nope.
l figured it out. Skadoosh.
look!
the Dragon Warrior.
that's my boy! That big lovely kung fu warrior is my son!
Yes!
Thanks, Dad.
Hey, guys.
master.
master.
master?
master Shifu!
master!
Shifu, are you OK?!
Po.
you're alive.
or we're both dead.
no, Master, l didn't die. l defeated Tai Lung.
you did?
Wow. lt is as Oogway foretold.
you are the Dragon Warrior.
you have brought peace...
to this valley...
and...
and to me.
thank you.
thank you, Po.
thank you. Thank you.
No! Master! No, no, no, don't die, Shifu, please!
l'm not dying, you idiot!
dragon Warrior...
l am simply at peace. Finally.
so, l should stop talking?
lf you can.
want to get something to eat?
Yeah.

I shall tell you of William Wallace.
historians from England will say I am a liar.
but history is written by those who have hanged heroes.
the king of Scotland had died without a son, and the king of England, a cruel pagan known as Edward the Longshanks, claimed the throne of Scotland for himself.
scotland's nobles fought him and fought each other over the crown.
so Longshanks invited them to talks of truce...
no weapons, one page only.
among the farmers of that shire was Malcolm Wallace, a commoner with his own lands.
he had two sons，John and William.
I told you to stay.
well, I finished my work.
where are we going?
MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit - Can I come? - No, go home, boy!
but I want to go.
go home or you'll feel the back of my hand.
go you home, William.
MacAndrews!
MacAndrews!
holy Jesus.
it's all right!
William!
William! William, it's all right.
it's all right. Easy, lad.
William.
and I say we hit back now!
we cannot fight them! It's suicide!
Wallace is right! We fight them!
every nobleman who had a will to fight was at that meeting.
we cannot beat an army.
not with 50 farmers.
we do not have to beat them, just fight them.
now, who's with me?
I am, Wallace.
all right, all right.
where do you think you're going?
I'm going with you.
Ah, you're going with me, are you?
and what are you going to do?
I'm going to help.
Hey, and a good help you'd be, too, but I need you to stay here
I can fight.
I know.
I know you can fight.
but it's our wits that make us men.
see you tomorrow.
English.
get down.
with your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm.
it's up to us, Hamish.
da?
da?
William.
come here, lad.
Amen.
William.
I'm your uncle. Argyle.
you have the look of your mother.
we'll stay here tonight.
tomorrow you'll come home with me.
I don't want to leave.
you didn't want your father to die either, did you?
but it happened.
did the priest give a poetic benediction?
the Lord bless thee and keep thee"?
it was in Latin.
you don't speak Latin?
well, that's something we shall have to remedy, isn't it?
the Lord bless thee and keep thee.
the Lord cause His light to shine on thee.
the Lord lift up His countenance upon thee
and give thee peace.
Amen.
your heart is free.
have the courage to follow it.
what are they doing?
saying good-bye in their own way playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.
it was the same for me and your daddy.
first, learn to use...
this.
then I'll teach you to use...
this.
many years later,
edward the Longshanks, King of England, supervised the wedding of his eldest son, who would succeed him to the throne.
Amen.
as bride for his son,
Longshanks had chosen the daughter of his rival, the king of France.
it was widely whispered that for the princess to conceive,
Longshanks would have to do the honors himself.
that may have been what he had in mind all along.
Scotland... my land.
the French will grovel to anyone with strength, but how will they believe our strength when we cannot rule the whole of our own island?
where is my son?
your pardon, milord.
he asked me to come in his stead.
I sent for him, and he sends you.
shall I leave, milord?
if he wants his queen to rule when I am gone, then, by all means, stay and learn how.
please.
nobles.
nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.
grant our nobles lands in the north, give their nobles estates here in England, and make them too greedy to oppose us.
but, sire, our nobles will be reluctant to uproot.
new lands mean new taxes, and they're already taxed for the war in France.
are they?
are they?
the trouble with Scotland is that it's full of Scots.
perhaps the time has come to reinstitute an old custom.
grant them prima noctes.
first night.
when any common girl inhabiting their lands is married, our nobles shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her wedding.
if we cart get them out, we'll breed them out.
that should fetch just the kind of lords we want to Scotland, taxes or no taxes, huh?
a most excellent idea, sire.
is it?
now in Edinburgh gathered the council of Scottish nobles.
among these was Robert the 17th earl of Bruce, the leading contender for the crown of Scotland.
Ah, I hear that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
my father believes that we must lull Longshanks into our confidence by neither supporting his decree nor opposing it.
a wise plan.
and how is your father? We missed him at the council.
his affairs in France keep him long overdue.
but he sends his greetings, and he says that I speak for all of the Bruces and for Scotland.
Ah, it's all over now.
you've dropped your rock.
test of manhood.
you win.
call it a test of soldiery, then.
the English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
the test of a soldier is not in his arm.
it's here.
no. It's here.
Hamish?
here you go, son.
come on, Hamish!
that was a good throw.
Aye. Aye, it was.
I was wondering if you could do that when it matters.
as it...As it matters in battle.
could you crush a man with that throw?
I could crush you like a worm.
you could?
Aye.
well, then do it.
would you like to see him crush me like a worm?
come do it.
you'll move.
I will not.
right.
he'll move.
well done!
fine display, young Wallace.
are you all right?
you look a wee bit shaky.
I should have remembered the rocks.
aye, you should have.
get up, you big heap.
it's good to see you again.
Aye. Welcome home.
Oh, me head.
Oh, you should have moved.
william will you dance with me?
of course I will.
I've come to claim the right of prima noctes.
as lord of these lands,
I will bless this marriage
Oh, by God, you will not!
it is my noble right.
good evening, sin'.
Ah, young Wallace.
grand soft evening, huh?
aye, it's that.
I was wondering if I might have a word with your daughter.
what do you want to have a word about?
Murron, would you like to come and ride with me？
in this? You're out of your mind.
it's good Scottish weather, madame.
the rain is falling straight down.
well, slightly to the side, like.
she can't go with you.
no the now, anyway.
no the now.
no the now? - We'll see you later.
the weather's just fine. It's hardly raining.
did you not hear what I said?
Murron! Get... Oh.
it's you she takes after.
how could you know me after so long?
well, I didn't.
I saw you staring, and I didn't know who you were.
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.
are you in the habit of riding off in the rain with strangers?
it was the best way to make you leave.
well, if I can ever work up the courage to ask you again,
I'll send written warning first.
wouldn't do much good. I can't read.
can you not?
no.
well, that's something。
you're going to teach me to read, then?
if you like.
in what language?
you're showing off now.
that's right. Are you impressed yet?
no. Why should I be?
do that standing on your head, and I'll be impressed.
my kilt will fly up, but I'll try it.
God, you certainly didn't learn any manners.
the French and Romans have far worse manners.
you've been to Rome?
Aye. Argyle took me on a pilgrimage.
what was it like?
what does that mean?
beautiful.
but I belong here.
Murron?
come in now.
Sin', I know it was strange of me to invite Murron to ride last night
mac Clannough's daughter is another matter.
I've come to fetch you to our meeting.
what kind of meeting?
the secret kind.
your meetings are a waste of time, Campbell.
your father was a fighter and a patriot.
I know who my father was.
I came back home to raise crops and, God willing, a family.
if I can live in peace, I will.
you say you want to stay out of the troubles?
if you can prove it, you may court my daughter.
until you prove it, my answer's no.
no?
no, Wallace. No.
didn't I just prove it?
No!
no?
No!
of course, running a farm's a lot of work, but that will all change when my sons arrive.
so you've got children?
Oh, not yet, but I was hoping that you could help me with that.
so you want me to marry you, then?
well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.
is that what you call a proposal?
I love you. Always have.
I want to marry you.
is that a "yes"?
aye, that's a "yes.
we best hurry. He'll be waiting.
Oh, wait.
where are you going?
what's that?
you'll see.
father.
I will love you my whole life, you and no other.
and I you, you and no other, forever.
when am I going to see you again?
tonight?
I can't.
why not?
my dad's growin' suspicious.
wouldn't have anything to do with that.
when? When? When?
when?
tonight.
tonight.
tonight.
look lively, Sergeant.
where are you going, lassie?
Ooh, that looks heavy.
let me help you with it.
no. It's fine.
I'm not going to steal it.
Oh, you remind me of my daughter back home.
Hello, lassie.
No!
keep it quiet, Smythe.
Aah! You...
bitch!
are you all right?
all right? Come on.
are you all right?
Aye.
are you all right?
can you ride?
Aye.
come back here, you bastard!
raise the alarm!
meet me at the grove.
ride!
they're getting away!
get him!
come on!
Murron?
Murron!
all of you know full well the great pains I've always taken never to be too strict, too rigid with the application of our laws, and as a consequence, have we not learned to live together in relative peace and harmony?
and this day's lawlessness is how you repay my leniency!
well, you leave me with little choice.
an assault on the king's soldiers is the same as an assault on the king himself.
now
let this scrapper come to me.
there.
corporal.
some archers on the tower now!
hold still.
you idiot boy!
father, how are you?
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!
what you waiting for, boy?
here. You can do it.
I'll hold him down.
pour it straight in the wound.
it seems like a waste of good whiskey.
indulge me. Ah!
hold him. Hold him.
hold him.
now let him go.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
that'll wake you up in the morning, boy.
there's somebody coming!
arm yourselves!
there's somebody coming.
MacGregors from the next clan.
we heard about what was happening.
we don't want you amadans thinking you can have your fun without us.
go home.
some of us are in this.
can't help that now.
but you can help yourselves.
go home.
we'll have no homes left when the English garrison from the castle.
and they will.
patrol returning, milord!
so what news?
I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.
they will be returning now!
what, are they dressed like this?
actually, it was more like 50.
make it quick.
you remember me?
I never did her any harm.
it was my right.
your right?
I'm here to claim the right of a husband!
I am William Wallace.
and the rest of you will be spared.
go back to England and tell them there that Scotland's daughters and her sons are yours no more.
tell them Scotland is free.
burn it.
the Scottish rebels have routed and murdered the noble lord.
I heard.
this Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.
and how would you deal with this brigand?
like any common thief.
have the local magistrate arrest him
leave us.
Wallace has already killed the magistrate and taken control of the town.
stand up.
stand up.
in the morning,
I depart for France to press our rights there, and I leave you here to quell this little rebellion.
understood? Is it?
one day, you will be a king.
at least try to act like one.
get away from me!
convene my military council.
there!
after them.
no point resisting.
you're outnumbered and trapped.
now, where are the rest of you? Where's Wallace?
father?
Oh, come in. Come in.
a rebellion has begun.
under whom?
a commoner...
named William Wallace.
you will embrace this rebellion.
suppon't it from our lands in the north.
I will gain English favor by condemning it and ordering it opposed
sit down.
stay awhile.
this Wallace...
he doesn't even have a knighthood, but he fights with passion, and he inspires.
and you wish to charge off and fight as he did, eh?
so would I.
well, maybe it's time.
it is time...to survive.
you're the 17th Robert Bruce.
the 16 before you passed you land and title because they didn 't charge in.
call a meeting of the nobles.
they do nothing but talk.
rightly so.
but history is written by those who have hanged heroes.
you admire this man, this William Wallace.
uncompromising men are easy to admire.
he has courage. So does a dog.
but it is exactly the ability to compromise
and understand this...
edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king ever to sit on the throne of England, and none of us and nothing of Scotland will remain unless we are as ruthless.
give ear to our nobles.
knowing their minds is the key to the throne.
wait. Wait.
look.
this is out, and this is left.
carry on.
carry on!
you know eventually, Longshanks will send
heavy cavalry, armored horse...
shake the very ground.
they'll ride right over us.
uncle Argyle used to talk about it, how no army ever stood up to a charge of heavy horse.
so what do we do?
hit, run, hide, the Highland way.
we'll make spears.
hundreds of them.
long spears...twice as long as a man.
that long?
Aye.
some men are longer than others.
your mother been telling you stories about me again.
volunteers coming in!
william Wallace, we've come to fight and to die for you.
stand up, man. I'm not the pope.
my name is Faudron. My sword is yours.
I brought you this.
we checked them for arms.
I brought you this.
my wife made it for you.
thank you.
him? That can't be William Wallace.
I'm prettier than this man.
all right, Father. I'll ask him.
if I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
is your father a ghost, or do you converse with the Almighty?
to find his equal, an Irishman talks to God.
the Almighty says don't change the subject.
just answer the fucking question.
mind your tongue.
insane Irish.
smart enough to get a dagger past your guards, old man.
that's my friend, Irishman, and the answer to your question is yes.
you fight for me, you get to kill the English.
Excellent!
stephen is my name.
I'm the most wanted man on my island, except I'm not on my island, of course.
more's the pity.
your island? You mean Ireland?
Yeah. It's mine.
you're a madman.
I've come to the right place, then.
sure didn't the Almighty send me to watch your back?
I didn't like him anyway.
he wasn't right in the head.
the English are advancing an army toward Stirling.
do the nobles rally?
robert the Bruce and most of the others will not commit to battle, but word has spread, and the Highlanders are coming down on their own.
in droves of hundreds and thousands.
are you ready for a war?
what news?
we're outnumbered, at least three to one.
how many horse?
300. Maybe more.
300 heavy horse?
we must negotiate.
who's in command?
did he have a scarlet chevron?
aye, he did.
we can still negotiate.
what are they talking about?
I can't hear, but it does not look good.
the nobles will negotiate.
they'll do a deal, then we go home.
if not, we charge.
we have no chance.
so many.
I didn't come here to fight
then I'll have to work for them.
nor me.
all right, lads! I'm not dying for these bastards.
let's go home!
stop, men! Do not flee!
wait until we've negotiated!
william Wallace.
can't be. Not tall enough.
the Almighty says this must be a fashionable fight.
it's drawn the finest people.
where is thy salute?
for presenting yourselves on this battlefield,
I give you thanks.
this is our army.
to join it, you give homage.
I give homage to Scotland, and if this is your army...
why does it go?
we didn't come here to fight for them!
home! The English are too many.
sons of Scotland...
I am William Wallace.
william Wallace is 7 feet tall.
Yes. I've heard.
he kills men by the hundreds, and if he were here, he'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes and bolts of lightning from his arse.
I am William Wallace and I see a whole army of my countrymen here in defiance of tyranny.
you've come to fight as free men.
and free men you are.
what will you do with that freedom?
will you fight?
No! - No!
No! - No!
against that? No!
we will run, and we will live.
fight, and you may die.
run, and you'll live...
at least awhile.
and dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!
they seem quite optimistic to me.
maybe they do want to fight.
confrontation might be a foregone conclusion, milord, but, nonetheless,
I think we should deliver the king's terms.
the king's terms? He'll never live up to them.
milord, I think...
all right. Offer them the terms.
shall we go and meet them?
let me do the talking.
agreed.
fine speech.
now what do we do?
just be yourselves.
where are you going?
I'm going to pick a fight.
well, we didn't get dressed up for nothing.
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.
here are the king's terms
lead this army off the field and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire, including hereditary title, from which you will pay...
from which you will pay him an annual duty
I have an offer for you.
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.
from which you will pay the king an annual duty...
I said I have an offer for you.
you disrespect a banner of truce?
from his king? Absolutely.
here are Scotland's terms...
lower your flags and march straight back to England, stopping at every home you pass by to beg forgiveness for 100 years of the rape and murder.
do that, and your men shall live.
do it not, and every one of you will die today.
you are outmatched.
you have no heavy cavalry.
in two centuries, no army has won...
I'm not finished!
before we let you leave, your commander must cross that field, present himself before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own arse.
I'd say that was rather less cordial than he's used to.
be ready and do exactly as I say.
on my signal, ride round behind our position and flank them.
we must not divide our forces.
do it, and let the English see you do it.
they'll think we run away.
take out their archers. I'll meet you in the middle.
insolent bastard.
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate.
archers.
Archers! Archers!
Archers!
archers, forward!
you bastards!
loose!
the Lord tells me he can get me out of this mess, but He's pretty sure you're fucked.
ready!
loose!
see. Every Scot with a horse is fleeing.
our cavalry will ride them down like grass.
send the horse.
full attack.
steady!
hold!
hold!
hold!
hold!
now!
send the infantry.
you lead them!
retreat!
bastard!
all right.
Wallace! Wallace!
I knight thee Sire William Wallace.
sire William, in the name of God, we declare and appoint thee guardian and high protector of Scotland and thy captains as aides-de-camp.
stand and be recognized.
does anyone know his politics?
no, but his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything.
the Balliols will kiss his arse, and so we must.
sire William.
sire William...
in as much as you and your captains may we invite you to continue your support and uphold our rightful claim.
damn the Balliol clan!
they're all Longshanks' men!
gentlemen.
gentlemen.
now is the time to declare a king.
you're prepared to recognize our legitimate succession?
you're the ones who won't suppon't the rightful...
those were lies...
I demand recognition of these documents!
these documents were lies when you wrote them!
gentlemen, please! Gentlemen!
please, gentlemen!
wait! Sire William, where are you going?
we have beaten the English, but they'll come back because you won't stand together.
what will you do?
I will invade England and defeat the English on their own ground.
invade? That's impossible.
Why?
why is that impossible?
you're so concerned with squabbling for the scraps from Longshanks' table that you've missed your God-given right to something better.
there's a difference between us.
you think the people of this country exist to provide you with position.
I think your position exists to provide those people with freedom, and I go to make sure that they have it.
wait!
I respect what you said, but remember that these men have lands and castles.
it's much to risk.
the common man that bleeds on the battlefield...
does he risk less?
no...
but from top to bottom, this country has got no sense of itself.
its nobles share allegiance with England.
its clans war with each other.
if you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
we all end up dead.
it's just a question of how and why.
I want what you want, but we need the nobles.
we need them?
nobles.
tell me, what does that mean...to be noble?
your title gives you claim but men don't follow titles, they follow courage.
now, our people know you.
noble and common...they respect you, and if you would just lead them to freedom...
they'd follow you.
and so would I.
damn it!
my sodomite cousin the prince tells me he has no troops to lend, and every town in Northern England is begging for help.
he advances!
to which town?
to here, milord.
bring the provisions inside!
double the wall guards! Seal the gate! Now!
bring in the provisions!
sire, we can get you out if you leave now.
I'm not about to tell my uncle
I've lost him the greatest city in Northern England.
come on!
make way for the king!
it's not your fault.
stand up to him!
I will stand up to him and more.
what news of the north?
nothing new, Your Majesty.
we've sent riders to speed any word.
I heard the word in France, where I was fighting to expand your future kingdom. The word my son is that our entire northern army is annihilated...
and you have done nothing.
I have ordered conscriptions.
they're assembled and ready to depart.
excuse me, sire, but there's a very urgent message from York.
come.
leave us.
thank you, sire.
uh, W-Wallace has sacked York.
what?
Wallace has sacked York.
sire...
thy own nephew.
what beast could do such a thing?
if he can sack York...
he can invade Lower England.
we would stop him!
who is this person who speaks to me as though I needed his advice?
I have declared Phillip my high counselor.
is he qualified?
I am skilled in the arts of war and military tactics, sire.
are you?
then tell me...what advice would you offer on the, uh, present, uh, situation?
I shall offer a truce...
and buy him off.
but who will go to him?
not I.
if I fell under the sword of that murderer, it might be my head in a basket.
and not my gentle son.
the mere sight of him would only encourage an enemy to take over the whole country.
so whom do I send?
whom do I send?
I'm dreaming.
Yes, you are.
and you must wake.
I don't want to wake.
I want to stay here with you.
and I with you...
but you must wake now.
wake up, William.
wake up.
William, wake up, wake up.
William!
a royal entourage comes!
flying banners of truce!
and the standards of Longshanks himself!
I am the princess of Wales.
I come as the king's servant and with his authority.
to do what?
to discuss the king's proposals.
will you speak with a woman?
I understand you have recently been given the rank of knight.
I have been given nothing.
God makes men what they are.
did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities?
the executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country, and that royal cousin hanged innocent Scots, even women and children from the city walls.
well, Longshanks did far worse
you ask your king to his face.
ask him.
you see if his eyes can convince you of the truth.
hamilton, leave us.
milady...
leave us. Now.
let us talk plainly.
you invade England, but you cannot complete the conquest
the king desires peace.
Longshanks desires peace?
he declares it to me. I swear it.
he proposes that you withdraw your attack.
in return, he grants you title, estates, and this chest of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
a lordship and titles...
gold...
that I should become Judas?
peace is made in such ways.
slaves are made in such ways!
the last time Longshanks spoke of peace,
I was a boy, and many Scottish nobles, were lured by him, under a flag of truce, to a barn... where he had them hanged.
I was very young, but I remember Longshanks' notion of peace.
I understand you have suffered.
I know... about your woman.
she was my wife.
we married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord.
they killed her...to get to me.
I have never spoken of it.
I don't know why I tell you now, except...
I see her strength in you.
one day, you'll be a queen...
and you must open your eyes.
you tell your king that William Wallace will not be ruled...
and nor will any Scot while I live.
Ah, my son's loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen.
so he accepted our bribe?
no, he did not.
then why does he stay?
my scouts tell me that he has not advanced.
he waits for you at York.
he says he will attack no more towns or cities if you are man enough to come and face him.
did he?
the Welsh bowmen will not be detected arriving so far around his flank.
the main force of our armies from France will land here to the north of Edinburgh.
conscripts from Ireland will approach from the southwest to here.
welsh bowmen? Troops from France? Irish conscripts?
even if you dispatch them today, they'd take weeks to assemble.
I dispatched them before I sent your wife.
so our little ruse succeeded.
thank you.
and while this upstart awaits my arrival in York, my forces will have arrived in Edinburgh behind him.
you spoke with this, uh, Wallace in private.
tell me...
what kind of man is he?
a mindless barbarian.
not a king like you, milord.
you may return to your embroidery.
humbly, milord.
you brought back the money, of course.
no. I gave it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
that's what happens when you send a woman.
forgive me, sire.
I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
my greatness will be better demonstrated when Wallace returns to Scotland and finds his country in ashes.
William!
there's riders approaching!
personal escort of the princess.
I didn't think you were in the tent that long.
Mademoiselle.
un message de ma maitresse.
Merci.
it's true! English ships are moving up from the south!
I don't know about the Welsh yet, but the Irish have landed!
I had to see it before I could believe it.
why are the Irish fighting with the English?
I wouldn't worry about them.
didn't I tell you before? It's my island.
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh and assemble the council.
order it.
your island?
my island! Yup!
no, please, gentlemen!
lords, Craig is right!
this time our only option
unless you want to see Edinburgh razed to the ground...
my army has marched for more days than I can remember, and we still have preparations to make, so I'll make this plain.
we require every soldier you can summon...
your personal escorts, even yourselves...
and we need them now.
with such a force arrayed against us, it's time to discuss other options.
other options?
don't you wish at least to lead your men onto the field and barter a better deal with Longshanks
sire William...
we can't defeat this army!
we can!
and we will!
we won at Stirling...and still you quibble!
we won at York, and you would not support us.
if you'll not stand up with us now, then I say you're cowards.
and if you're Scotsmen,
I'm ashamed to call myself one.
please, Sire William, speak with me alone.
I beg you.
now, you've achieved more than anyone ever dreamed, but fighting these odds, it looks like rage, not courage.
it's well beyond rage.
help me.
in the name of Christ, help yourselves!
now is our chance. Now.
if we join, we can win.
if we win, we'll have what none of us ever had before...
a country of our own.
you're the rightful leader.
and there is strength in you, I see it.
unite us.
unite us!
unite the clans.
all right.
right.
this cannot be the way.
you said yourself...
the nobles will not support Wallace.
so how did it help us
I gave him my word.
I know it is hard.
being a leader is.
but, son... son...
look at me.
I cannot be king.
you and you alone can rule Scotland.
what I tell you, you must do.
not for me, not for yourself, for your country.
lads, make way.
coming through here.
make way, lads.
the Bruce is not coming, William.
he'll come.
Mornay and Lochlan have come.
so will the Bruce.
quite the lovely gathering.
wouldn't you agree?
the archers are ready, sire.
not the archers.
my scouts tell me their archers are miles away
arrows cost money. Use up the Irish.
the dead cost nothing.
and send in the infantry and cavalry.
Infantry!
Infantry!
cavalry!
cavalry!
cavalry!
advance!
advance!
good to see you this morning!
Irish.
glad to have you with us.
watch this.
Mornay? Lochlan?
I gave Mornay double his lands in Scotland
Lochlan turned for much less.
archers.
I beg pardon, sire.
won't we hit our own troops?
yes...
but we'll hit theirs as well.
we have reserves.
attack!
Archers!
archers attack!
loose!
loose!
send in our reinforcements.
send in the rest!
bring me Wallace.
alive, if possible.
dead... just as good.
send us news of our victory.
shall we retire?
protect the king.
get up!
get up!
up!
get up!
get him out of here!
go!
I'm dying.
let me be.
no.
you're going to live.
I've lived long enough to live free.
proud to see you become the man you are.
I'm a happy man.
I'm the one who's rotting, but I think your face looks graver than mine.
son...
we must have alliance with England
you achieved that.
you saved your family, increased your land.
in time, you will have all the power in Scotland.
lands, titles, men, power... nothing.
nothing?
I have nothing.
men fight for me...
because if they do not, I throw them off my land and I starve their wives and their children.
those men who bled the ground red at Falkirk...
they fought for William Wallace, and he fights for something that I've never had.
and I took it from him when I betrayed him, and I saw it in his face on the battlefield, and it's tearing me apart!
well, all men betray, all lose heart.
I don't want to lose heart!
I want to believe...as he does.
I will never be on the wrong side again.
No!
lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?
Aye. Wallace rode into his bedchamber and killed him.
more a liability now than ever he was.
and there's no telling who'll be next.
maybe you.
maybe me.
it doesn't matter.
I'm serious, Robert.
so am I!
search the place!
Lochlan.
william Wallace killed 50 men.
50 if it was one.
100 men...
with his own sword.
cut through them like...
moses through the Red Sea.
his legend grows.
it will be worse than before.
he rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, and when he replenishes his numbers...
they're sheep! Mere sheep!
easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.
very well.
pick a flock of your finest assassins and set a meeting.
for his ability to smell an ambush.
if what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct, he warmed to our future queen.
he would trust her.
so we'll dispatch her with the notion that she comes in peace.
milord, the princess might be taken hostage or her life be put in jeopardy.
my son would be most distressed by that.
but in truth, if she were to be killed, we would soon find the king of France a useful ally against the Scots.
you see, as king, you must find the good in any situation.
it's William Wallace, sure.
he's giving up his sword.
be ready.
milady...
I received your message.
this is...the second time you've warned me of danger.
Why?
there will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month...foods and weapons.
no, stop.
why do you help me?
why do you help me?
because of the way you are looking at me now.
just when we thought all hope was lost, our noble saviors have arrived.
off with their...hoods.
sire William, we've come to seek a meeting.
well, what's the point?
you've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.
an oath to a liar is no oath at all.
every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
so let the council swear publicly.
we cannot. Some scarcely believe you're alive.
others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages.
so we bid you to Edinburgh.
meet us two days from now.
pledge us your pardon, and we'll unite behind you.
scotland will be one.
one? You mean us and you.
no.
I mean this.
it's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.
you do know it's a trap. Tell him.
if the Bruce wanted to kill you, he'd have done it at Falkirk.
I know. I saw.
leave him aside. What about the others?
nest of scheming bastards!
they couldn't agree on the color of shite!
it's a trap. Are you blind?
look at us.
we've got to try.
we can't do this alone.
joining the nobles is the only hope for our people.
you know what happens if we don't take that chance?
what?
nothing.
I don't want to be a martyr.
nor I. I want to live.
I want a home and children and peace.
do you?
aye, I do.
I've asked God for those things.
it's all for nothing if you don't have freedom.
that's just a dream, William.
a dream? Just a...
then what have we been doing all this time?
we've lived that dream.
your dream isn't about freedom.
it's about Murron.
your dream is to be a hero 'cause you think she sees you.
I don't think she sees me. I know she does.
and your father sees you, too.
Jesus.
get up. Give us your hand.
shall I come with you?
no. I'll go alone.
I'll see you after.
right.
sooner rather than later, I hope.
he won't come.
he will.
I know he will.
milord, he approaches!
No!
stay out of it, Robert!
you lied! You lied!
Bruce is not to be hurt! That's the arrangement!
father!
you rotting bastard!
Why? Why?
Longshanks acquired Wallace.
so did our nobles.
that was the price of your crown.
die!
I want you to die!
soon enough I'll be dead, and you'll be king.
I don't want anything from you.
you're not a man!
you're not my father.
you're my son, and you've always known my mind.
you deceived me.
you let yourself be deceived.
in your heart, you always knew what had to happen here.
thus, you know what it means to hate.
now you're ready to be a king.
my hate will die...with you.
william Wallace, you stand in taint of high treason.
against whom?
against your king.
have you anything to say?
never in my whole life...
did I swear allegiance to him.
it matters not. He is your king.
confess, and you may receive a quick death.
deny, and you must be purified by pain.
do you confess?
do you confess?
then on the morrow, you shall receive your purification.
your Highness.
I will see the prisoner.
we've got orders from the king...
the king will be dead in a month.
his son is a weakling.
who do you think will rule this kingdom?
now open this door.
Majesty.
come on, filth. Up on your feet.
stop it!
leave me.
I said, leave me!
milady.
sire, I come to beg you...
to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy.
will he show mercy to my country?
mercy is to die quickly, perhaps even live in a tower.
in time, who knows what can happen...
if you can only live?
if I swear to him, then all that I am is dead already.
you will die. It will be awful.
every man dies.
not every man really lives.
drink this.
it will dull your pain.
no. It will numb my wits.
I must have them all.
for if I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
I can't bear the thought of your torture.
take it.
all right.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
you're quite taken with him, aren't you?
I respect him.
at worst, he was a worthy enemy.
show mercy, O thou great king, and win the respect of your own people.
even now...you are incapable of mercy.
and you...
to you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.
before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
you see...
death comes to us all.
but before it comes to you, know this...
your blood dies with you.
a child who is not of your line grows in my belly.
your son will not sit long on the throne, I swear it.
I'm so afraid.
give me the strength...to die well.
here he comes!
now behold the awful price of treason!
you will fall to your knees now.
declare yourself the king's loyal subject and beg his mercy.
and you shall have it.
rope!
stretch him!
pleasant... yes?
rise to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and you will feel no more.
rack him!
enough?
it can all end right now.
peace...
just say it.
cry out... mercy.
mercy!
mercy! Mercy!
cry out.
mercy! Mercy!
just say it...
mercy.
mercy! Mercy!
mercy, William.
mercy. Jesus, now say it.
the prisoner wishes to say a word.
mercy! Mercy!
mercy!
Freeeedoooom!!
after the beheading,
william Wallace's body was torn to pieces.
his head was set on London Bridge, his arms and legs sent to the four corners of Britain as a warning.
it did not have the effect that Longshanks planned.
and l... Robert the Bruce...
rode out topay homage to the armies of the English king and accept his endorsement of my crown.
I hope you've washed your arse this morning.
it's about to be kissed by a king.
come. Let's get it over with.
stop!
you have bled with Wallace!
now bleed with me.
Wallace! Wallace!
Wallace!
Wallace!
Wallace!
Wallace!
in the year of our Lord, 1314, patriots of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, charged the fields of Bannockburn.
they fought like warrior poets, they fought like Scotsmen...
and won their freedom

Yeah, Okay
put it this way say I rent to a woman
well, she has to have a room with a bath, because otherwise she's got the hall bath tied up all the time, washing her goddamn hair and her clothes and everything she can think of
I had my first hotel 37 years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas, and that's when I learned about women
they don't make the money, see, for a place like this
not regular, they don't
there's only one way they can get it by sellin'their self tappin'them cute little piggy banks they all got - Mr Dillon - Mr Simms
here's a potential neighbor of yours
Mrs Langtry may drop by

grifters, huh?
you're one, all right
grifters got an irresistible urge to beat a guy who's wise
there's nothing to whipping a fool
hell, fools are made to be whipped
but to take another pro, even your partner, who knows you and has his eye on you that's a score
no matter what happens
so, you want to learn a few tricks,
I'll teach you a few tricks
but your hand does not get into my pocket

Oh Oh, of course

you always did

Ah, the usual, I guess
and that's it?
what else?
well, that's what I want to know
is Is this all we have, Roy "sex with my baby"?
not that I'm knocking it, but is that all?
what are you driving at, Myra, marriage?
I didn't say that
ah But, well, that's what I asked - I don't think so - Ha
I'm a very practical little girl, and I don't believe in giving any more than I get
and that might be pretty awkward for a matchbook salesman or whatever you are
everybody needs matches
what do you sell, anyway?
self-confidence
God knows you have it to spare
I'll see you tomorrow
hey
no kiss?
Hello, Mrs Langtry

I am?
you belong in bed, Miss Flynn
here I'll give you part of mine
you will not
but you must
I've seen girls with this look before
bed is the only thing that will cure them
bed without dinner might cure you
you'd better behave, or I won't kiss you good night, and then you'll be sorry
you'd better behave, or I'll tell your mother
well, we wouldn't want that, now, would we?
Oh Hi, Myra I didn't recognize you
no, I'm sure you didn't
MYRA's been here
and what's your objection to Myra?
the same as anybody's
I stopped by your place, picked up your mail
just bills I'll take care of them
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly
whatever you say
the manager at your place said your boss called
really pulled the wool over everyone's eyes, huh?
what are you talking about?
so I've got a job So what?
stop kidding me
four years in a town like Los Angeles and a peanut-selling job's the best you can do?
you expect me to believe that?
well, it's there The boss called

those clown pictures on the walls?
I like those - You do not
Roy Dillon, cornball clown pictures, commission salesman it's all a front

you were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you
how come?
you aren't tough enough
not as tough as you, huh?
how'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
I tripped on a chair
get off the grift, Roy
Why?
you haven't got the stomach for it
Oh, good, Carol, come in
dr Mitchell says you can get out of here Friday, but that you should have someone to look in on you, so I hired Carol
you hired?
well, you'll pay me back I know that
Lilly, I make my own decisions for a long time now
Roy, you couldn't possibly object to a pretty, young lady coming to visit you
Carol
do you know why my mother hired you?
why, yes
I'll come in every afternoon and make sure
she hired you for me to fuck
to keep me away from bad influences
isn't that right, Lilly?
it is not
uh, Mrs Dillon, perhaps I
go wait in the hall Don't go away
you didn't have to do that
I thought I did
so you won't take a thing from me, is that it?
sex?
I'm not offering you sex, you little punk
that's not what I meant
for Christ's sake, Lilly, you're just throwing that wallflower at me 'cause you don't like Myra
MYRA's nothing She's less than nothing
then why does she bug you?
you jealous?
of what?
you want to lie down with dogs?
and I'll pick the dog

Joe

are hidden germs lurking in your nooks and crannies?
all right, this is your final warning
you've got to settle your bill today
now, Joe, don't I always pay my bills, huh, one way or another?
Yeah, well, this time there's just one way
stop getting up nights, man
you, too, could learn to dance
all you need is a magic step, simple as one, two, three
here's your bill
it's a lot of money, Joe
you wouldn't have padded it
you owe every damn cent of that
maybe I could get the dough from your wife Do you suppose?
maybe your kids'd crack their piggy banks
you take one step towards my family, and I promise you
Oh, oh! Don't wet your pants, for Christ's sake!
come in, Joe
the money
there it is
the automatic clutch, Joe
it comes with the deluxe upholstery and the high-speed wiry zone
MYRA, please
I've let you
I've been very good to you
I've let you stay here month after month
can't be done, Joe
all passengers must pay as they enter
no free passes or rebates
that's a strict rule of the Intercourse Commerce Commission
Oh, God
only one choice to a customer, the lady or the loot
what's it gonna be?
your difference between your folded towel and your clean towel is a trip to the laundry
when you're cleaning those bathrooms, what you do is you pick up the towel, and you give it a good shake and a good look, and you say to yourself, "Would I dry myself on this towel?
if the answer is yes, you fold it
what if it's wet?
mr Dillon, welcome back
you're looking fine, just fine
thank you, Mr Simms I'm feeling fine
I'm glad you're better - Sickness comes to us all, Mr Dillon - That's true, Mr Simms
we never know when, we never know why, we never know how The only blessed thing we know is it'll come at the most inconvenient, unexpected time, just when you've got tickets to the World Series, and that's the way the permanent waves
that fella could be a congressman
if it's wet, you don't fold it
you shake it and hang it neatly on the rod provided
Yes, sir
what are you laughing at?
Oh, nothing
nothing, nothing No, never mind, Joe
it's just, I was remembering at lunch, on the menu, it said "Today's special "Broiled hothouse tomato under generous slice of ripe cheese"!
Hi, Bobo
did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
well, I guess so You're the guy I work for - I'm the guy you work for, huh? - Yeah
then in that case, I may just flush you down the toilet
take me to my hotel
troubadour
how'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo
you're fucking right, you're not
how much did your pals cut you in for on that nag?
or are they giving you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
I was down on that horse, Bobo, maybe not as much as I should've been
but there was a lot of action
one question do you want to stick to that story or do you want to keep your teeth?
I want to keep my teeth
all right, I'll ask you another
you think I got no contacts out here?
that nag paid off on almost the opening price
there wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the first odds were posted
there ain't enough action to tickle the tote board, and you claim a 10 grand win
you send me $10, 000 like I'm a fucking mark you can rip off
no, Bobo, I didn't
you want to talk to me straight up?!
my son
your what?
my son was in the hospital
what the fuck are you doing with a son?
he left home a long time ago
he was in the hospital up in Los Angeles
he was real sick
motherhood
I never fucked up before, Bobo
you got any kind of long coat in the car, something you could wear home over your dress?
no
I'll loan you a raincoat
you guys take a walk
will you go in the bathroom and bring me a towel?
you ever hear about the oranges, Lilly?
you mean the insurance framers
tell me about the oranges, Lilly while you put those in the towel
you hit a person with the oranges wrapped in a towel
they get big, ugly-Iooking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right
it's for working scams against insurance companies
and if you do it wrong?
it can louse up your insides
you can get p-p-p-p-p-p-p-p
What?!
P-p-permanent damage
you never shit right again
bring me the towel
Oh, no!
Oh, no! Oh, no! No!
Oh, no!
come on, get up
you go clean yourself up The coat's on the bed
Oh, I almost forgot 10 grand it's yours
troubadour, huh?
you want a drink?
gee, uh, I better not, if that's okay
I still got to drive up to Los Angeles
see your son, huh?
that's nice, Lilly a side of you I never knew
Yeah, he's a good kid, a salesman - On the square, huh? - Yeah
how you making out these days?
stealing much?
from you?
my folks didn't raise no stupid kids
you're not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Oh, well, you know, clip a buck here and a buck there, not enough to notice
that's right take a little, leave a little
a person who don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else
he's a liability, right, Bobo?
that's 1, 000% right, Lilly
or else he's working an angle
if he's not stealing a little, he's stealing a lot
you know it, Lilly
you know, I
I like that suit, Bobo
I don't know what there is about it, but somehow it makes you look taller
yeah?
yeah
you You really think so?
yeah
a lot of people have been telling me that
well
you can tell them for me they're right
well, I best be going
Roy will wonder where I am - Worries about his mother, does he? - Yeah
you give him a hug for me
I will
Thanks, Bobo
so long, Bobo
I don't see
I don't see why we have to take the train
what if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
well, we will rent a car
big spender

MYRA, I'm not following this
Roy, you're a short-con operator and a good one, I think

the long end, big con

is that right?
it is, Roy It's where you should be

wow
Vicky and Cristina decided to spend the summer in Barcelona.
Vicky was completing her master's in Catalan Identity...
Cristina, who spent the last six months writing, directing and acting in...
...a 12-minute film which she then hated...
...had just broken up with yet another boyfriend, and longed for a change of scenery.
everything fell into place when a distant relative of Vicky's family who lived in Barcelona...
...offered to put both girls up for July and August.
the two had been close since college and shared the same tastes and opinions on most matters.
yet when it came to the subject of love, it would be hard to find two more dissimilar viewpoints.
Vicky had no tolerance for pain and no lust for combat.
she was grounded and realistic.
her requirements in a man were seriousness and stability.
she had become engaged to Doug because he was decent and successful...
...and understood the beauty of commitment.
Yeah, I miss you, too.
Cristina, on the other hand, expected something very different out of love.
she reluctantly accepted suffering as an inevitable component of deep passion...
...and was resigned to putting her feelings at risk.
if you asked what she was gambling her emotions on to win, she would have been unable to say.
she knew what she didn't want, however. And that was exactly what Vicky valued above all else.
you're Vicky. -Yes, Vicky.
you're so grown up.
it's been a while. It's great to see you.
welcome to Barcelona. Cristina, I'm Judy.
this is your room.
I put you together.
Judy, thank you so much for having me here.
it was so last-minute and you don't know me at all. To include me is so sweet of you.
it's so nice to have a little action around here.
it's been so quiet since Arthur went off to college.
after the girls unpacked and Judy's husband, Mark, got home from the golf course, lunch was served.
we have a beautiful home. - We've really come to love it.
he makes friends with anybody and speaks the language, so he was like, "Whee! "
you learned just fine.
what do you do, Cristina?
I am currently at liberty.
come on. She made a film.
how exciting. -It was 12 minutes.
what was it about?
about? It was about why love is so hard to define.
that's a mighty big subject to handle in 12 minutes.
Vicky, you're getting your master's in...
Yeah, my master's in Catalan Identity.
what do you plan on doing with that?
I don't know. Maybe teaching, maybe curating.
you don't have to do something.
she's marrying this wonderful man in the fall and all her conflicts will be resolved...
...when he makes her pregnant.
now that Judy's decided your future...
to your summer in Barcelona. Welcome.
in the days that followed, Vicky and Cristina drank in the artistic treasures of the city.
once, Mark and Judy invited Vicky and Cristina to go sailing with them on Mark's boat.
with Cristina in mind, Mark and Judy asked along the son of one of his business partners...
...an eligible young man Mark thought she might like.
my dream is to accumulate enough wealth, sail off to an island and spend my days snorkeling.
I'm actually a snorkeling nut.
have you ever snorkeled before?
unfortunately, Charles and Cristina were not a match made in heaven.
Vicky, meanwhile, researched every aspect of Catalan life...
...even getting a tour of the market and a local restaurant, to delve into Catalan cooking.
on balmy summer nights, the girls would sometimes go hear Spanish guitar music...
...which never failed to move Vicky in some magical way.
one evening, Mark and Judy took them to the opening of a friend's art gallery.
many local artists and a number of collectors attended.
do you like them? - I do. Thank you for taking us.
we buy from this gallery.
mark has commissioned this artist...
...to do a series of pictures for his office walls.
is that the artist over there?
in the red?
no, no. That's not...
alfred is, um...
he's the gentleman in the linen coat right there. That's him.
I don't know who that is.
mark? Who is the gentleman in the red shirt over there?
he's a painter. Remember? Diego told us about him.
he had that fiery relationship with that beautiful woman who was nuts.
the violent fighting and the messy divorce.
it was in all the newspapers.
Oh, my God. His name is Juan Antonio Gonzalo...
...and he had this hot divorce and she tried to kill him. Or he tried to kill her.
it was this really big thing in the art world.
I can't remember the details.
we don't move in those bohemian circles, so I don't know.
Vicky and Cristina left the art gallery and decided to go for dinner.
they strolled past the church in the wonderful summer night air, while people celebrated...
...finally winding up around midnight at a little restaurant.
it's nice to be able to not have to worry about if some place is going to stay open.
Yeah, but we probably should be worrying about our dreams.
who are you looking at?
isn't that the painter we just saw at the gallery?
Oh, yeah. He's the...
...painter with the bad divorce. Mark told us. I was half listening.
he keeps looking over here. - Because you keep provoking contact.
I'm not provoking contact.
you've been throwing him little looks all night.
I'm just drinking my wine.
Yeah, of course you are. You must be doing something because he's coming over.
American?
I'm Cristina and this is my friend, Vicky.
what color are your eyes?
they're blue.
I would like to invite you both to come with me to Oviedo.
to come where?
for the weekend. We leave in one hour.
where is Oviedo?
a very short flight. - By plane?
what's in Oviedo?
a sculpture that is very inspiring to me.
a very beautiful sculpture. You'll love it.
you're asking us to fly to Oviedo and back?
no, we'll spend the weekend. I'll show you around the city.
we'll eat well, we'll drink good wine, we'll make love.
who exactly is going to make love?
hopefully, the three of us.
Oh, my God. - I'll get your bill.
this guy doesn't beat around the bush.
why not? Life is short.
life is dull. Life is full of pain. This is a chance for something special.
right. Who exactly are you?
I am Juan Antonio. And you are...
...Vicky, and you are Cristina. Right?
or is it the other way around?
it could be the other way around...
...because either of us will do to keep the bed warm. I get it.
well, you are both so lovely and beautiful.
well, thank you, but we do not fly off to make love......with whoever invites us to charming little Spanish towns.
does she always analyze every inspiration...
...until each grain of charm is...
...squeezed out of it?
I guess I have to say that...
...my eyes are green, actually.
I wouldn't call our reluctance...
...to leap at your sexual offer being over-analytical.
if you would care to join us for some...
...recognized form of social interaction like a drink, we'd be fine...
...but otherwise, I think you should try offering to some other table.
what offended you about the offer?
surely not that I find you both beautiful and desirable.
offended me? No.
it's very amusing...galling, to be honest, but...
is it getting a little late?
I would love to go to Oviedo.
what? Are you kidding?
I think it would be so much fun. I'd love to go.
can we discuss this some other time?
when I saw you across the room at the art gallery...
...I noticed you have...
...beautiful lips. Very full, very sensual.
thank you.
I can't guarantee the lovemaking--I happen to be very moody.
let's not negotiate like a contract.
I came over here with no subterfuge, and presented my best offer.
I hope you will discuss it and give me the pleasure to take you with me to Oviedo.
I have the good fortune to borrow my friend's plane.
it's just big enough for the three of us and I'm a very good pilot.
it sounds very safe.
think it over.
I hope you're joking about going.
this guy is so interesting. - Interesting?
what's so interesting? He wants to get us both into bed.
but he'll settle for either. In this case, you.
Vicky, I'm a big girl, okay? If I want to sleep with him, I will. If not, I won't.
Cristina, he's a total stranger. His is impulsive, even for you...
...and if I heard right, he was violent with his wife.
at least he's not one of those factory-made zombies.
this is a great way to get to know him.
no, it's not. I'm not going to Oviedo...
...with this charmingly candid wife beater.
you find his aggressiveness attractive, but I don't.
and he's certainly not handsome.
I think he's very handsome. He has a great look. I mean, he's really sexy.
well, you would, because you're a neurotic.
what? It's all bullshit.
I'm not going to Oviedo. First off, I never heard of Oviedo.
...and was free to have some kind of dalliance with a Spaniard, I wouldn't pick this one.
Oh, hi. I can't talk right now.
I'm trying to save Cristina from making a potentially fatal mistake.
what? No, the usual.
I'll call you back.
I love you, too.
if we go back to the house now, we can just throw some things in a bag and we'll meet him there.
I took an instant liking to this guy.
he's not one of these cookie-cutter molds. He's creative and artistic.
cookie-cutter mold?
is that what you think of Doug?
Doug? Who said anything about Doug?
it's ridiculous. You like the way it sounds to pick up and fly off in an airplane.
I know. I don't know why I'm so scared, unless I'm scared of myself.
it's a mistake, Cristina.
they predicted a little storm out of the town, out of Oviedo, but it's nothing serious.
don't worry, really. As you can see here...
there, it's just a little bumpy, right?
would you like to fly it? - No, thank you!
it's easy. It's even easier than a car. Try it.
by early morning, they had reached their destination...
...and proceeded to a hotel that Juan Antonio had selected for them.
Vicky made sure she and Cristina had their own room and Juan Antonio had his.
if he was disappointed, he hid it well.
are you very religious? -No. No, I'm not.
the trick is to enjoy life, accepting it has no meaning whatsoever.
no meaning? You don't even think that authentic love gives life meaning?
Yes, but love is so transient, isn't it?
I was in love with the most incredible woman...
my God, that's terrible.
maybe you did something to deserve it.
Juan Antonio took his guests for lunch. They discussed art and romance.
he was full of stories about Maria Elena, his ex wife...
he proved to be a good host, and in the afternoon, he took them to see the local sights...
...where they enjoyed hearing about the city and took photos.
later, they bought candy and cakes at a charming sweet shop...
...which were homemade and delicious.
they continued to document their trip and while Vicky remained skeptical...
...Cristina had a wonderful time.
the question of sleeping together did not come up until that night...
...and Juan Antonio was a little drunk.
you're welcome.
well...
now that the day is almost over...
...is it reasonable of me to ask you if you would both join me in my room?
come on. I thought we settled that.
Vicky's just trying to say she's engaged to be married.
great. Then these are her last days of freedom.
no. Look, I'm not free. I'm committed.
you know what my theory is? When I drink, I get brutally frank.
I think that you're still hurting from the failure of your marriage to Maria Elena...
...and you're trying to lose yourself in empty sex.
empty sex? Do you have such a low opinion of yourself?
she's just saying it has to have meaning for her, that's all.
I mean, the city is romantic. The night is warm and balmy.
we are alive. Isn't that meaning enough?
I just came along to keep Cristina company. I'm engaged to be married.
...who also holds a very real place in my heart.
and to be perfectly frank, Juan Antonio...
...if I were the type of person who played around, I don't think it's in the cards for us.
so, I'm tired. I haven't slept in twenty-four hours...
...and that is exactly what I'm going to do.
and you?
I'll go to your room, but you have to seduce me.
hello - Hello
I am just here to have a quick drink...
...to say thank you, then I'm going back to my room.
did you act in the small film you made?
did I act? Yeah, I acted. Why?
I hope you were more convincing than you are pretending to have come here for one quick drink.
I am here to go to bed with you. You're right.
so you're pretty much home free, unless you...
...Blow it. - Blow it?
blow it. You mean ruin the moment?
Yeah.
and how would I do that?
I don't know. It could be anything from...
...some insane comment to...
...wearing the wrong kind of shorts.
Although...somehow, by looking at you...
...wearing the wrong kind of shorts.
you're very hard to please.
Yeah, well...I am famous for my intolerance.
and what do you want in life besides a man with the right shorts?
I don't know.
which is what?
Something...else. I want something different. Something more.
some sort of...counterintuitive love.
Meaning?
meaning, um...
I don't know.
I don't know what I want. I only know what I don't want.
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. It's something I ate.
what's wrong? Can I get you anything?
no, I...I shouldn't be drinking.
what happened? - I'm going to be sick.
it's her ulcer and perhaps food poisoning. Maybe both.
God, both.
she must just ret. Not eat. - Rest?
Yeah, rest, rest.
with Cristina stuck in bed, Vicky was anxious to get back to Barcelona and in no mood to sightsee.
when he gets out of his meeting, can you get him to call me on my cell?
Yeah, I'm still stuck in Oviedo.
but sightsee is what they did.
I feel very sorry about Cristina.
Oh, come on. Don't pretend concern.
I'm sure you kept encouraging her to drink...
...as you did to both of us throughout dinner. But I can hold my liquor.
she never mentioned her ulcer. - No.
no, because she's a mental adolescent...
...and being romantic, she has a death wish.
so for a brief moment of passion...
...she completely abandons all responsibilities.
...which she found very beautiful.
I was born near here.
it would be a sin if I came out here without paying a visit to my father. Would that be boring to you?
no.
no, I think that would be the first genuinely interesting proposition you've made me.
I would love to see your father and his house.
if we carry on, I don't think it's...
that's fine. That was great. He speaks no English.
I'm sure my Spanish is going to go.
he refuses to speak any other language. That's an important point with my father, actually.
Really? Why?
because he's a poet and he writes the most beautiful sentences in the Spanish language...
...but he doesn't believe a poet...
...should pollute his words by any other tongue.
it makes sense. I understand, because of the translation...
...and the things you might lose.
I took some Spanish. Of course, I have no flair for languages.
I read it much better than I speak it.
maybe I could read your father.
no, he doesn't publish. That's the point.
well... - Why not?
Yes, thank you. Just a very, very, very little.
you look good -- you look healthy, Papa.
Yes, and you, too, look well.
what do you hear of Maria Elena?
she's still living with the architect in Madrid.
that woman was the best
I still have erotic dreams about her, at my age.
she also loved you very much, Papa.
what a shame -- with that gift of God...
this was my favorite place to read when I was young.
and, yes, I wanted to be a writer, not a painter. Painting came later.
and I wanted to play music, too.
I mean, all I knew is that I was full of...I don't know
real emotion, and I had to find a way to express it.
Cristina says the same thing.
Cristina is a very interesting girl. Want to sit?
Yeah.
so...
...tell me, why won't your father publish his poems?
because he hates the world...
...and that's his way of getting back at them. To create beautiful works and then...
...deny them to the public, which I think is...
my God.
well, what makes him so angry toward the human race?
because after thousands of years of civilization...
...they still haven't learned to love.
they returned to the hotel.
Cristina was feeling better, but far too shaky and needed more rest.
Vicky and Juan Antonio dined together at a lovely little restaurant.
she was more relaxed than at lunch, and had just finished a great deal of wine.
this time she was enjoying the conversation.
...no place on earth.
my father used to bring me here.
hello.
did I get you at a bad time, babe?
no, I'm just about to eat. Can I call you back?
let me just say one thing. Paul and Maryanne found a house up where they are...
...that they like even better than the one in Bedford Hills
Oh, yeah? Uh, you're breaking up a little.
How--? Babe? Call me later, but this house has a pool and a tennis court.
we could both take lessons from Paul's instructor.
okay, I'll call you back. I can't hear you.
I love you.
God. The connection's terrible.
here. - Thank you.
what is this wine? It's delicious. - It's great.
uh, yes, yes.
why were you so nervous speaking to him?
was I nervous?
Yes, you turned red.
well, I'm sure it's the wine.
would he be upset if he knew we were dining together?
no, not at all! Are you kidding?
I mean, I don't think he'd love the basic concept...
...of me sitting with a man drinking wine over candlelight...
...but he'd quickly realize there was nothing to worry about, so...
would you ever withhold your work from the public out of rage?
no, I'm not like my father.
no, I told you...
...I affirm life, despite everything.
right, right.
well...
I'd be curious to see your work.
Really?
Why? I mean, you are so disapproving of me.
well, I've gotten to know you better.
it'd be interesting, and after all, you are a Catalan painter and that's my subject.
what gave you such an interest in Catalan culture?
well...
...and one thing led to another.
you also admire Spanish guitar, I hear.
Yes, yes. I love the guitar.
would you like to go hear some wonderful guitar tonight?
tonight?
well, it's a little late, and...
...I'm a little wobbly from the wine.
you said you could hold your alcohol.
besides, we leave tomorrow.
okay, sure. - Great.
that was unbelievable. Thank you, thank you.
I was looking at your face and you looked very moved.
Yes, yes. - A few times, I saw a look like that.
right. On Maria Elena, I'm sure
well, yes, maybe on Maria Elena. If she saw...
...or heard something that moved her, yes.
you're still in love with her.
no, I'm not, I'm not.
that confirms it.
no, she will always be a part of me.
she's an important person in my life...
...but for the two of us, something was not working.
what element?
we never found out.
you said you were looking at my face.
Why?
why were you looking at mine?
was I?
you probably saw my tears.
Yeah...I'm a little out of control.
I was looking at your face because I find it very beautiful. - You do? - Of course I do.
of course I do. You know I do.
on the trip home, Vicky, who had mentioned nothing to Cristina, was silent.
Cristina, on the other hand, talked nervously.
I must apologize to both of you for ruining the whole weekend!
I'm completely mortified! I'm humiliated.
I don't know if it was the wine, or the shellfish. Because I have this ulcer.
I just thank God you knew enough sights to keep Vicky occupied.
I had these horrible nightmares that you two would be like oil and water...
...hating every minute of being together. I just couldn't move.
Vicky buried herself in work at the library.
she put foolish ideas out of her head and concentrated on her thesis.
but she found her thoughts frequently returning to Oviedo.
Cristina, searching for a means of self-expression...
...wandered the streets of Barcelona, experimented with her latest passion, photography...
...and believed that she had made a fool of herself...
...exactly at the moment of truth with Juan Antonio.
then, 48 hours later, Cristina came to Vicky with an announcement.
Vicky, he called!
what? Who?
Juan Antonio. He called me just now.
Juan Antonio called you?
Yeah, he wants to take me to some vineyard...
...some wine tasting or something. I said, "Absolutely."
a wine tasting. But what about your ulcer?
no, it's fine. A little wine's not going to hurt me. The point is that he wants to see me!
isn't that great? - Yeah, yeah.
I can't believe it. I never thought he would call.
that's great. I'm happy for you.
that night, the two women had trouble falling asleep.
Cristina sat in the kitchen, drinking coffee and working on her poetry.
Vicky, too, was lost in memories of a night that now seemed more and more unreal.
halo?
Hey, babe. Did I wake you?
no, no. I was just going to sleep.
sorry I called so late. I had to get out of the office.
get some air, get some coffee, and I had this great idea. Check this out.
dad has contacts in the American Embassy in Spain.
I thought I'd come early, work from there on my computer and we could get married in Barcelona.
you said it was a romantic spot. We'll just do a quick city hall-type thing.
of course, we'll do it again in New York--have a huge blowout, but it'd be fun. What do you think?
what? To get married here?
why not? It'd be great to tell our kids we got married in Spain...
...and Dad's friends would make it real easy for us.
I don't know what to say.
you don't sound bowled over.
no, it's, uh...
...It's just a surprise.
we're going to marry in the fall anyway, and we're going to do that, too, I promise.
so what's the point?
the point is, it's different, it's exciting. I told Ken and Alice.
I called them earlier and they said they wish they'd done it.
I mean, London in their case, but they were excited.
well, I, uh...
you sound a bit reluctant.
me? No. Why would I be?
no, I...
...I think it's a fine idea. I think it's great. It's a great idea.
Yeah, I think it's going to be good.
I'll call you tomorrow. I know I woke you. I'll give you more details tomorrow. I love you so much.
Juan Antonio took Cristina to a wine tasting.
after, he took her back to his house, a lovely place he had purchased from another painter years ago...
...and which served as his home and his studio.
he showed her his work, which delighted her.
she loved the colors and the wild, emotional way he applied the paint to the canvases.
from there, it was only one floor up to his bedroom.
he told her of his marriage to Maria Elena, and their deep love...
...and their terrible fights.
he told her he had not wanted to make love with anyone else in the bedroom they shared...till now.
this time, Cristina kept her food down.
Juan took Cristina out several more times.
they went to see a new sculpture by a friend of his.
he showed her some of his favorite parts of the city, where she took photographs.
Juan Antonio was friendly with all the whores and thought they would make wonderful subjects.
he encouraged Cristina's work, although she was always too shy to allow him to see it.
he took her to lunch with his friends, who were poets and artists and musicians.
Cristina held her own quite well.
...Vicky had a chance encounter.
Vicky.
hello - How are you? - My goodness, what are you doing here?
nothing. Just doing some sketches.
Oh, right.
well, I didn't mean to disturb you.
disturb me, no. How could you disturb me?
we never had a chance to say a proper good-bye.
well, you could have called me.
Yeah, I debated it. But I didn't think there was much point.
but you never phoned, not to say anything.
thank you. It was fun.
you don't make love to someone and then never call them...
...unless you were greatly disappointed.
quite the opposite
but...
...you have plans to marry...
...and I thought it best to stop anything before it led to a bad situation for everyone.
I'm only saying that we made love and you seemed to drop off the face of the earth.
I mean, I realize these things don't mean much to you.
to pursue matters would have only caused you anxiety, and me, a disappointment.
I had the ability to hurt you after one night?
Maria Elena used to say that...
...only unfulfilled love can be romantic.
right. Okay.
well, the truth is, you're much more suited to Cristina.
I've grown very fond of Cristina.
so, I'm very happy for you and your husband-to-be.
and I...
...for you and Cristina.
and so the morning came when Vicky's husband-to-be arrived from New York.
Juan Antonio, like certain creative men, needed always to live with a woman...
...and had invited Cristina to move in with him, which she accepted.
so you're with Global Enterprises? Tom Sutter's an old friend of mine.
you know Tom Sutter? We play golf!
you do? Well, I got some stories. Tom has never beaten me.
well, he's not the greatest player in the world.
my God. You're a whole different person here.
yeah? What does that mean?
you were so into it.
well, am I not usually?
no, of course you are.
I'm giving you a compliment.
maybe it's the Barcelona air.
come here, hold me. Hold me.
you okay? - Yeah.
how's Cristina doing?
she's already moved in with some guy.
that was quick. Don't tell me he's a bullfighter. - No
writer? Composer? Tortured pseudo-intellectual and self-destructive?
Yeah, I know. Sometimes she gets on my nerves with her crackpot love affairs.
look, I love her because she's your friend...
...but I've warned you about her. She's an unhappy person.
she can't part with that self-image of the oh-so-special woman...
...the artist trying to find herself.
well, men like her. - She's pretty.
and not exactly difficult to maneuver into the sack.
now you, on the other hand, took a little effort to get to bed.
but it was worth the struggle.
yeah? -Yeah.
Juan Antonio wants to take me to this old amusement park he said I would love.
I thought we could get lunch, all of us...
...then we could all see it together.
what, tomorrow for lunch?
we can't. We have plans.
no, we can always go boating with Mark and Judy.
I'd like to go with Cristina and Juan Antonio. - I really want to go boating.
Yeah, that would be great. Tomorrow. Okay.
the couples met for lunch and during the course of conversation, an awkward moment occurred.
Juan Antonio, having warm thoughts about Cristina, tried to brush his foot...
...against hers under the table, and accidentally brushed Vicky's.
the amusement park was everything Juan Antonio led them to believe.
it was antique and charming, and overlooked all of Barcelona.
Yes, he's lovely.
and very well suited to you.
I only mean you make a comfortable couple in the best sense.
you don't understand. I can't do anything about it now.
I'm not saying the thought hasn't crossed my mind, but
Vicky, please. We must not get into this conversation again.
things have moved on and I've developed real feelings for Cristina.
then what...? Why did you rub your foot against mine under the table?
I didn't. - Yes.
I didn't. - When I looked over at you.
no. If I did, it was a mistake. My intention was to touch Cristina.
okay, I'm sorry. I apologize for my mistake.
I'm sorry, it was my mistake, but listen.
you are all set to enter a completely different life. A life you always wanted with the man you love.
Yes, goddamn it, and then I met you...
...and we had this ridiculously irrational weekend together and now I don't know where I am.
please.
I'm with Cristina and you're getting married in two weeks, Vicky.
I know.
I know. You're right. Cristina loves you. I would never.
Yes, and Cristina and I are a good fit.
she speaks my language. You and I we'd be at each other's throats in a month.
all right?
maybe our paths will cross again someday, under different circumstances.
who knows about life?
you're right. You're right, I'm an idiot.
I don't know what I expect to happen.
and so the wedding day came and Vicky married Doug.
Cristina was there. She did not bring Juan Antonio, who made an excuse.
following the ceremony, the bride and groom left for a mini-honeymoon in Seville.
meanwhile, Cristina began to sense the possibility of the kind of relationship she had always sought...
...but in the past had eluded her.
she was the lover of an exciting man, an artist whose work she believed in.
she was already thinking of herself as a kind of expatriate...
...not smothered by what she believed to be America's puritanical and materialistic culture...
...which she had little patience for.
she saw herself more a European soul, in tune with the thinkers and artists...
...she felt expressed her tragic, romantic, freethinking view of life.
with Juan Antonio's circle of friends, she hobnobbed with creative people of all sorts.
she loved their company and continued to experiment with writing and taking pictures.
you have a good time? - Yeah. Seville is breathtaking.
we ran into some friends from New York, got to spend some time with them.
a little too much time.
you're just angry because they beat our brains out at bridge.
I don't like bridge. - Me, either.
what is this? - Swag. Your attention, please.
Cristina and Juan Antonio sent you this wedding gift.
when I found out she was seriously dating Juan Antonio, I couldn't believe it.
just what we need--a Rorschach blot.
I don't think I like it.
we'll buy you one of Alejandro's.
Maria Elena is...she tried to kill herself.
what?
is she okay?
Yes. Yes, I think so. I don't know. I have to go.
where are you going?
I'm going to the hospital.
should I come with you?
I don't think that would be a good idea for her. She's a mess.
well, call me if you want me to come
okay, of course. Of course.
Juan Antonio hurried out in the dead of night.
Cristina tried to go back to sleep, but had an uneasy feeling.
she dozed restively, but awoke at the darkest hour.
I'm just up here making coffee! Is everything okay?
Cristina, this is Maria Elena.
I feel like such a fool.
here you have to speak English. Please.
I'm embarrassed.
Oh, no. Please, don't feel embarrassed.
can I get you anything at all?
vodka.
vodka?
you're going to have a vodka now?
with all those pills you took?
are you crazy, or what?
I want to take a shower, Juan Antonio, can I?
I want to get rid of these clothes.
in English, in English.
when you are here, you have to speak English.
you want to take a shower, go there, in the guest room.
so now I'm a guest in my own house?
Yes. You are a guest.
go on, Maria Elena, please. Go on.
there. You know where the room is.
so...what's going on?
what?
nothing. - Is everything okay?
I think she's okay, yeah.
I mean...
...things didn't work out for her in Madrid and...
...she came back on the bus tonight, alone.
her whole world looked black and all her plans had come to nothing and...
...she overdosed in the bus terminal.
Oh, my God, that's terrible.
she has to stay with us.
what? Stay with us?
she has to stay with us. She has no money. She has no one capable of caring for her.
I, I always...
I was always her connection to the real life.
I understand, but, I mean, how can she stay here?
you know, I think...
...she can't be trusted to stay alone. That's the problem.
I mean, even if...let me think...even if I...
...if a place could be worked out...
maybe she needs psychiatric help.
no. She's always had bad experiences with doctors.
I understand, but where is she going to stay? - In there.
well, how long is she going to stay here?
Cristina, I know...
I understand. - She has no one else.
I understand. It's only for a short time. - A few months at most.
she's staying for a few months?
I've been through this with her before.
so...I mean, if...
shit.
if you had only known her when I first met her.
I mean, her beauty took your breath away.
Yes, I know. - She was so talented, so brilliant...
...she was so sensual.
she chose me from a hundred men ready to kill for her.
we were both sure that...
...our relation was perfect, but there was something missing.
like, love requires such a perfect balance.
it's like the human body.
it may turn out that you have all the vitamins and minerals, but...
...if there is a single, tiny ingredient...
...missing, like, like...
...salt, for example...one dies.
salt?
who is she?
she is the woman I live with.
you have to speak English around her. Please.
Why? For her sake?
Yes, exactly. Out of courtesy.
I don't trust her, Juan Antonio.
her eyes are not one color.
you always had paranoid ideas about every woman I've ever known.
she's pretty.
do you think she'll be enough for you?
well, she's quite intelligent and she is a free thinker, like you.
like me? - Yes.
you're still searching for me in every woman.
that is not true, Maria Elena.
I was in Oviedo some weeks ago with a woman who was the antithesis of you...
...an American, and something beautiful happened with her.
so you're mistaken.
you'll always seek to duplicate what we had. You know it.
in this house, speak English. That's all I ask.
all right?
don't talk to me like that.
why are you getting so angry at me?!
listen, listen.
why were you thinking about killing yourself?
what a stupid idea did cross on your mind!
I mean, to try to kill yourself, for Christ's sake!
stay here until you get back on your feet...
...and then I beg you, please, get out of my life!
we came so close to perfection, you and I.
you're too damaged. - And you love that.
you've always liked my mood swings.
but what was missing, Juan Antonio?
what was missing?
speak English!
I don't like her for you! I don't trust her. And you know I always have your best interest.
not when you tried to kill me.
Oh, that. - Yeah, that. That small detail.
I mean, you...
...are suspicious of her because she is now my lover. It's so obvious.
no, no. I see you so lost, so confused, since we split up.
for all your talk of swearing off women and renouncing love...
...to end up losing your head...
...not for one, but two...
...American tourists.
more coffee?
Yes, please.
I'm sorry.
here's sugar.
no, thank you.
I thought we could go for a ride to the countryside later.
I mean, the weather is beautiful.
it's definitely going to rain later.
in English.
no, it's fine.
you speak no Spanish?
no. I studied Chinese.
Chinese?
Why?
I thought it sounded pretty.
say something in Chinese.
me?
you think that sounds pretty?
well, maybe not the way I'm pronouncing it, but...
if you ask me, Chinese sounds strident. It's like a drill to the head.
speak English, Maria Elena.
you ever hear them in the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant? It's so unpleasant.
Maria Elena, enough.
speak English.
I'm sorry. I am nervous today. I had bad dreams.
would you like to paint?
do you paint also?
do I paint, she asks.
ask him, ask him. He stole everything from me. His whole style.
she likes to make up these stories.
your whole way of seeing is mine.
I'm not saying that you were not influential. - Influential?
Yes.
Influential? - Yes, but to say I stole your style
hypocrite, hypocrite, hypocrite.
to say I stole your style is too delusional.
it's okay. We painted side by side...
...for many years, and you adopted my vision as your own.
that's a tale you invented and like to spread.
but it's not true.
she always had problems with reality. I'm not going to get angry.
I'm not going to get angry.
what did they say in art school? That I was a genius.
I always encouraged your talent.
I'm not talking about talent. I said genius. Genius.
I came close to killing for you.
you came close to killing me--with a chair.
I was defending myself. You had a razor and you were drunk...
...with a razor and raging!
that was jealousy -- I was crazy for you and...
...you betrayed me -- with Agustino's wife.
with your eyes!
with your eyes!
you wanted to kill me for looking?
I don't want to talk about that anymore, okay?
it's over.
I see you with someone else now and I'm fine. I'm civil.
what else do you want?
as the days passed, Cristina observed Maria Elena and Juan Antonio...
...and found the heart more puzzling than ever.
where were you? Writing?
Yeah, I was trying to.
I'm so curious. Does she really think that you stole from her?
well, I guess I took......more from her than I like to admit.
I feel kind of sad. - Why?
because I feel like I'm never going to be able to......influence you or inspire you in any way.
it's how I feel. - That's not true.
that's not true. I never heard the Scriab--, the Scriabin...
...Piano Sonata until you played the recordings for me and now I can't stop listening to it.
no?
well, that makes me happy.
what?
maybe it's not a good idea here.
what?
she's been better lately...
...and I don't want to upset her.
of course, no. Okay.
it was at Vicky's afternoon language class, which she took several days a week...
...to improve her Spanish, that she met Ben...
...a young man who couldn't stop noticing her, and started to chat her up each day.
I can't believe they hired me at the consulate. My Spanish is less than perfect, to say the least.
no, I think it's good.
it's all right.
but are you enjoying your time in Barcelona?
I would if I had more friends.
you want to see a movie?
a movie? - Wednesday afternoon?
Yeah.
the movie was a great success and Ben proved to be very good company for Vicky.
...and when the storekeeper took a phone call in the back, he couldn't resist taking her hand.
No...don't.
no?
no.
you do know that I'm recently married.
Yeah. I guess I was under the impression that...
...maybe you jumped into it too quick and regret it?
regret? Have I implied that?
unless I read into it.
no.
I shouldn't tell you this.
I was always someone who thought I knew exactly what I wanted.
but you didn't.
well, no. I met somebody else and, uh...
I'm not going to get into that story.
so, this guy you met?
the guy is living with my best friend.
what am I talking about?
when I hear myself, it's just crazy.
I just married the guy I wanted.
did you?
I thought so.
so? What happened?
one goddamned weekend in Oviedo.
Cristina, Juan Antonio and Maria Elena went riding in the country.
Maria Elena had decided they would all cook a big dinner and insisted they pick fresh blackberries.
wait for me!
gives me vertigo!
this is the perfect spot. - Here, like that.
can you get some... - Okay, here.
what's wrong?
what, what, what? What happened?
wait, sit down. Sit, sit, sit, sit.
is it your upper or your lower?
here. Hold on. - Here?
wait, let me...
you want some aspirin? I have aspirin in my bag.
okay. You relax. I'll be right back.
it's all in his head. He has so much tension.
to the world, he's carefree, nothing matters, life is short, with no purpose.
but all his fear just goes to his head.
do you know that she plays piano?
no...
...I didn't. Is that why you have a piano in the house?
I could have been a concert pianist.
Yes, you could have. No one plays Scarlatti like Maria Elena.
she understands Scarlatti. Am I right?
do you play music?
no. I just have to come face to face with the fact...
...that I am not gifted, you know?
I can appreciate art and I love music, but...
it's sad, really, because I feel like I have a lot to express...
...but I am not gifted.
but you do have talent.
no. -Yes.
what's my talent?
you take beautiful photographs.
that's true. She always takes pictures that she hides from me.
that's because they're nothing. How do you know I take pictures?
I found them in your luggage.
you went through my luggage?
of course I did. First night I was in the house, I didn't trust you.
I didn't believe you were who you said you were.
I wanted to know who was really sharing the bed of my ex-husband.
What?!
who knew what I would find? How could I be sure you were not going to hurt me?
after all, I had thoughts of killing you.
so here are a few more.
don't say you like them if you don't.
what are you talking about? - They are beautiful!
you see? - Look at this.
the next day, Maria Elena went out photographing with Cristina.
she had a superb eye and knew a lot about the art of photography...
...and taught Cristina much about the aesthetics and subtleties of picture taking.
she advised her to get rid of her digital camera and use an old one, for more interesting results.
she said it was important to have a darkroom, and she would set one up in the basement for Cristina...
...and teach her various techniques of developing her own pictures.
they photographed everything, from silly-looking dogs to grim-faced children.
but the best subject was Maria Elena herself.
shopping one afternoon, Vicky and Doug ran into Adam Tabachnick and Sally.
Adam was in the same business Doug was in and they were friendly...
...although in New York, they did not spend a lot of time together.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
any program on TV, obviously anything live, you can play back on your computer.
so I'm on a flight to Tokyo, 40, 000 feet up in the air...
...and I am watching the Mets, live, on my laptop.
you're never out of touch.
you have to have my guy do your installation. He's a genius with computers.
I'll get his card.
we just did our place in Greenwich.
we have this wonderful decorator you should use.
he's creative, but he knows when to back off.
we did it modern, with just a splash of antiques here and there.
I love combining the two, but God, the prices.
you have any idea what a good size oriental rug costs?
she's right.
actually, there's an old joke. A hundred thousand for a Persian rug? For fifty thousand...
life continued predictably for Vicky and Doug...
...until one afternoon, when an unpredictable moment occurred.
several days later, Judy asked Vicky to meet her privately, away from the house, to have coffee.
what happened the other day. I...
...don't want you to get the wrong idea.
it's really none of my business.
I'm not having an affair with Mark's partner. I'm not.
no, I didn't think you were.
not that I haven't had fantasies of...
...someone coming along and taking me out of my situation.
but the fantasies are not Jay Lewis.
even though he would like that. He would.
taking you out of your situation...?
I haven't been in love with Mark...
...for years. I love him, but I'm not in love with him.
I'm sorry to hear that.
it's funny. I just made...
...I just made the same speech to my shrink.
well, what does your shrink say?
he says...
...I'm looking for some kind of magical solution...
...which is unrealistic.
and an affair is not the answer.
I'm sorry to be laying all of this on you...
...but I was so humiliated when you saw us.
I'm just...
look, you mustn't feel that you have to explain yourself to me.
mark is great.
I'm sure any...
...any dissatisfaction I have is my own problem.
I'm just...
I can't leave him and I know that I never will.
why not?
I just...I can't.
I'm too scared.
the moment's passed.
it's so apparent to me that you and Juan Antonio are still in love...
...when I see you together.
our love will last forever. It's forever, but it just doesn't work.
that's why it will always be romantic--because it cannot be complete.
maybe it can't be complete because...
I dont know. I feel like...
no. Before you...
...we used to cause each other so much pain, so much suffering.
without you, all this would not be possible. You know why?
because you are the missing ingredient.
you are like the tint that, added to a palette, makes the color beautiful.
aren't you and Juan Antonio tempted to make love?
I feel like...I don't know.
at the end of our marriage, we didn't.
but I have to say those feelings are coming back now, thanks to you...
...in a new and deeper way.
I wouldn't be upset about it. I'd never want to get in the way. It wouldn't upset me at all.
I know you wouldn't be upset. The same way I get this warm feeling...
...when I hear you both locked in passion every night.
I listen, and I'm happy.
was Cristina okay with it when Maria Elena and Juan Antonio made love one afternoon?
beforehand, she gave them both her blessing, but then had mixed feelings.
she was not as open-minded as she had always imagined herself...
...and the thought of the two of them in bed, and inevitably full of intensity, caused her some conflict.
in the end, she gradually relaxed...
...and let herself go with the flow of things, a tolerance she was proud of.
what's right, what's wrong, what's appropriate according to the "appropriate police."
you see how screwed up most relationships are.
what you're saying is you're sharing a man. You're like a Mormon wife.
I know it sounds strange, but we all contribute to the relationship and we're really nourished by it.
but if everyone did that, society couldn't function. - Oh, come on!
let's not get into one of those turgid, categorical imperative arguments. Whatever works.
whatever works? - Maria Elena says there are many truths in life.
I don't know. Could you live like that?
well, I've never had Cristina's...
what? Her lack of structure? - It's very structured.
I never had her courage.
her courage? Next thing, she'll be going to bed with Maria Elena...
...and glorifying it as some kind of superior alternative lifestyle.
I have gone to bed with her.
No! - Yeah.
when?
well, Juan Antonio and Maria Elena made this darkroom for me.
they're pushing me to take photographs and I'm getting pretty good.
believe it or not, I'm getting much more confident.
and we were down there in the darkroom.
I was working on some of my photographs, things...
...I wouldn't have done if she hadn't inspired me.
and it happened very naturally for both of us.
you weren't nervous?
no, it was very loving and gentle.
did you enjoy it? - I did.
it was just the one time?
Yeah. I mean, it just happened, you know?
I'm not planning on making a habit out of it, necessarily.
but if you enjoyed it...
I did, I did at the time.
did you tell Juan Antonio? - Of course. There's nothing to hide.
would you say, then, you are a bisexual?
No...I see no reason to label everything. I'm me!
I've slept with Juan Antonio since and enjoyed that experience very much.
it's a great story.
that's a...great story.
look, I don't set myself up as a judge, so...
what are you thinking?
Oh, I don't know. How quickly time passes.
summer's almost over.
we're going home soon.
I thought you were still dwelling on...
...your friend's little tale of lust in the darkroom.
and speaking of darkrooms...
come here.
over the next weeks, Cristina became more and more sure of herself as a photographer.
both Juan Antonio and Maria Elena contributed ideas and support when she had doubts.
thanks to their encouragement, photography was becoming a productive interest in her life.
by now, she and Juan Antonio and Maria Elena had become lovers.
everything seemed perfectly balanced, perfectly in tune.
Maria Elena was calm and relaxed.
Juan Antonio was going through a very creative period with his painting.
it was only Cristina, as the last days of summer expired...
...who began to experience an old, familiar stirring...
...a growing restlessness that she dreaded, but recognized only too well.
suddenly, thoughts started taking precedence over feelings.
thoughts and questions about life and love.
and, as much as she tried to resist these ideas, she could not get them from her mind.
finally summoning her resolve...
...one evening after dinner, she made an announcement that surprised everyone.
I don't want what my parents had. I don't want what I had before I came here.
I know that. But I know I can't live like this forever.
did I tell you or not?
okay.
what do you want? - I want something different.
what?
I don't know. Not this.
there is no answer, Cristina.
don't you understand? She's gotten what she wanted.
she wants something else. This isn't enough for her.
it's like an illness. Nothing will ever be enough for her
don't get so upset. And speak English. I can't understand you.
this girl will never be satisfied with anything.
speak English so she can understand us.
I knew you would use us. I knew you would use us. And you used us.
I knew it.
I knew it! I knew it.
enough.
speak English, please, so she can understand.
chronic dissatisfaction, that's what you have. Chronic dissatisfaction.
big sickness. Big sickness.
that's not it, Maria Elena. That's not it.
it's simply that... Look at me.
do you know how much we love you?
Yeah. And I love you both.
no, you don't! - It has nothing to do with that!
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
shut up now, please.
shut up now. It's simply that she hasn't met the right person yet.
when she does find the right person--not you or me...
...this whole thing about finding peace and happiness will pass.
that's not it. - Okay, fine.
where will you go, Cristina?
...and clear my head.
this is all my problem. It has nothing to do with you.
come here.
let's be...
...thankful for all the good times that we've spent together. All right?
and remember each other with respect...
...and love and affection.
Cristina told all that had happened to Vicky...
...and said she was going to France for a few weeks to think things out.
she would return to pick her up, so they could go back to New York together.
so it's been Juan Antonio all this time?
I'm not going to do anything. Forget I said
I just needed to tell someone and we've become close.
why don't you act on it? - Act now?
what, break up with Doug, who's a really sweet guy...
...who married me in good faith, for...for what?
for a bohemian Spanish painter with a passionate tie...
...to an ex-wife who probably doesn't even share my feelings, if he ever did?
who am I kidding? But the dream is exciting.
if I were you, I wouldn't waste another minute. I'd get on it.
get on what?
you're in love with him.
do something, or the years will pass by and you will be sorry, Vicky.
no, no. What are you saying?
I can't risk everything. If Juan Antonio had never existed...
...I'd be fine with Doug.
just fine? - Yeah, as I planned.
how blunt do you want me to be? When I look at Doug, I see Mark.
you're using me to rewrite your own history.
despite Vicky's protestations...
...Judy was possessed with finding a way to bring her and Juan Antonio together...
...and prevailed upon her friend, Gabriella, who was a figure in the art world...
...to throw a party and invite Vicky and Juan Antonio.
meanwhile, as predicted, without Cristina...
...the relationship between Juan Antonio and Maria Elena had gone back to its old destructiveness.
I devote all my time to you--pampering you, nursing your tics and phobias.
my work suffers. - It's not my fault.
it's not my fault that your work has gone to shit and that you don't mature.
do you know what it is like for me to see...
...that you will never realize your full potential?
leave me alone. Leave me alone, please!
as had happened before by mutual consent, Maria Elena packed her things...
...and moved out of Juan Antonio's house.
he gets in very close.
he's a close talker. He's a close talker.
that's probably why he's so successful.
I was telling her in the car ride over here that I'm very...
I think he'll be a great contact for me.
I'm going to check out the food. Does anyone want anything?
he gets in your face.
he'll get a little close, but not
hello.
I'm surprised to see you.
as am I to see you. I didn't think you liked parties.
Gabriella insisted I come and she's an old friend.
you know that Cristina and I are no longer together, right?
Yes.
so now you're just with your ex-wife?
no, Maria Elena is gone as well.
for now.
it's funny. Maria Elena and I......are meant for each other and not meant for each other.
it's a contradiction. In order to understand it, you need a poet, like my father.
because I don't.
how about you? All goes well with your husband?
Oh, yes, he's wonderful. He's terrific.
I'm quite delighted with the way things turned out.
why don't I believe you?
don't become flirtatious.
I realize your bed is empty now...
...and you always had a little yen for me, but we're preparing to leave by the weekend, so...
meet me for lunch.
I'm too scared.
what?
you're breaking up, Tom.
you're breaking up.
where are you?
okay. That's better. That's better. Just try to stand still.
can you hear me?
we have to get a bird for Mark and Judy.
we can't get them a bird.
why not? - It's ridiculous.
they're beautiful. I always wanted a bird.
you know, when we get home, I'd love to get a bird for the new house.
and I'm leaning towards Bedford Hills. What do you think?
Yeah, yeah.
hold on.
Hallo?
spend tomorrow afternoon with me.
it's not possible. We're preparing to leave by the weekend.
be on the corner of Calle Tiles in Pedralbes.
I'll drive by and pick you up at noon.
you're wasting your time. I can't talk now.
I'm not the kind of man who would try to come between a husband and wife.
but Judy Nash called me and tells me you are not happy.
that you are actually more in love with me than the man you married.
I can't talk.
Hey, babe. What do you think?
who was that?
on the phone.
Oh, it was my, uh, language teacher.
yeah?
he wants me to have a good-bye lunch with him tomorrow at noon.
that's perfect. I'm going to play golf with Mark in the morning.
well, this is...
I've been working on these ones lately.
they're very overwhelming. Oh, my God.
it's very hard to explain a painting.
you don't have to. It's fascinating.
this one, actually, should be the other way around.
can I...can I be frank about something?
this one.
there's something very frightening about it.
that one is Maria Elena's. - Well, that explains it. It's very chaotic.
erratic, almost. But...
Oh, God, what am I doing here?
I don't know what I expect to happen.
it's been a long time since we made love that night in Oviedo.
I've thought about it many, many times.
I'm sure you weren't thinking about it when you were making love to Cristina or Maria Elena.
well, I never lied to you.
I told you from the first moment that I was attracted to both you and Cristina.
I can't just go to bed with you. I'm not good at this.
but you weren't nervous that night. - I wasn't married.
you were about to be.
Yeah, you're right. It's what I want.
but what am I supposed to do?
make love with you and then go on with my marriage like nothing happened?
Judy Nash says you are heading for an unhappy life.
Yeah, well, she's talking about herself.
maybe you will understand more about your own feelings once we've made love.
Yeah, or less.
look, I'm not saying I'm not tempted...
...but it would require such an upheaval, emotionally...
what are you doing?!
you're going to kill yourself!
I don't want to live. I don't want to live, damn it!
let it go. Now, now, now.
don't you understand that I don't want to live, that I can't live like this.
my head is going to explode.
I can't take this anymore. I can't take it anymore.
give me the gun.
give me the gun. Damn it!
listen to me, please, my love.
my love, listen to me.
it's okay, my love. It's okay.
Oh, my God,
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
Oh, my God, you're both crazy! Both of you are completely insane!
how the hell am I going to explain this to my husband?!
I can't live like this! This is not my life!
I just can't do it!
I still don't understand why your language teacher had a gun.
I told you. He collects antique firearms. He was showing me his favorite one and it went off.
we should sue him! That is so irresponsible!
no, it's not that bad, honestly.
what if something happened to you?
what? What are you saying?
I love you so much.
Doug never found out the real story.
Judy knew the secret and, of course, was relieved that Vicky had not been hurt worse, or killed.
with Vicky leaving to go back to New York, Judy's plans to rescue Vicky...
...from her own fate were put on terminal hold.
when Cristina returned from Antibes, Vicky told her the whole tale...
...and Cristina thought it was sad how much Vicky had wanted Juan Antonio...
...and was unable to say or do anything about it.
I would have stepped aside.
look, I knew you had feelings for Juan Antonio the moment you saw him.
but if I knew what had happened, I never would have gone ahead with it.
look, it was a......a passing thing.
now it's over.
Vicky went home to have her grand wedding to Doug...
...to the house they both finally settled on...
...and to lead the life she had envisioned for herself before the summer in Barcelona.
Cristina continued searching...
...certain only of what she didn't want.
Paris
Valentino.
should we do her in fur?
no, no, no.
Valentino.
absolutely not.
how does it feel being the only designer in the world who has managed to last 45 years?
I feel wonderful.
do you ever think of retiring - and giving up? - Well, maybe one day certainly.
how would you define, in one word, your choice to live in another man's shadow?
even a significant one.
happiness.
how long have you, Matteo Marzotto, owned Valentino?
I'll expect you all in July for my big return to Rome.
are you happy to celebrate - 45 years in Rome? - Yes, very much.
they should go out.
why do they stay here?
what is the idea of glamour?
this is in my blood, you know.
what I have to do?
like I love a beautiful lady,
I love a beautiful dog, I love a beautiful piece of furniture.
I love beauty. It's not my fault.
what do women want?
Yeah, I know, I know, I know what women want.
what do they want?
they want to be beautiful.
wonderful, wonderful. Wonderful.
forty-five years later, and Valentino is still leading the way in glamour.
sexy, molto.
I had a hard-on the whole time.
Valentino's Haute Couture show has sparked rumours
Valentino may be about to retire.
but the designer, who's in his 70s, denied it.
and it was quite moving as well, the show.
I hope it won't be his last one.
and everyone was standing up and cheering and I think he felt very emotional.
so beautiful. So beautiful.
Valentino told us a story, and it still is a good story.
it is like a book. You read a chapter and go on, and we want to arrive it to a good ending.
there's a small problem.
the dogs are taking up two seats.
okay, we'll take two dogs.
who is going to hold this for me?
you see, the draping goes like this.
like that.
and the same thing on the other side.
here you have the bow.
and underneath, the pleating comes down like this.
did you understand? - Yes.
so when it's ready, we'll try it.
everything by hand.
once we bought a sewing machine.
one machine for a hundred seamstresses.
no one ever used it.
it's a world that people don't know about.
you have to be born with Haute Couture, because you don't learn it in fashion school.
was there ever a time, Valentino, when you didn't want to be in fashion?
no. - You could never remember...?
I mean, even you never wanted to be like a fireman, or a train driver?
no, no, no.
I remember very well when I was young, - I was faking to sleep. - Pretending to sleep.
and I was dreaming, dreaming about movie stars, dreaming about everything beautiful in the world.
my mother used to say, "You are a dreamer.
you always dream, dream, dream, dream about stupid things," she used to say.
I was always so attracted by magazines, by films.
I had a sister, and she took me for the first time to see some films.
and to me, the dream of my life was to see those beautiful ladies of the silver screen.
I remember Ziegfeld girl...
you know, for me, a young guy of 13, to see this sort of beauty,
I think from that moment
I decided I want to create clothes for ladies.
you didn't even undo this.
where did you go?
everything is undone underneath here.
didn't you see this was becoming a mess?
how many times do I need to explain?
I'm really fed up.
really fed up.
where is it? I can't wait here all day.
we only have three days to Paris.
they're not answering.
give it to me.
if he gets angry, it'll be even worse.
where do you take it out from?
go up and see if she's coming.
Oh, finally, it's Michela.
is she coming down? Thank you.
so Antonietta is getting the shoes.
let's prepare the dress with the paper.
I don't care about the paper, I'll take it like this.
it's going to get caught in the chair!
I don't care! I'm pissed off now.
Antonietta, hang on a second.
calm down. - No, I don't care.
you have to call Mr. Giammetti.
because he wants to see this.
what can we do to get rid of these?
if I do it now, it will fall apart.
Oh, you're almost at the end of the fabric.
Yes.
that's what I call an evening gown.
that's what I call an evening gown.
for evening? - Yes.
no, daytime.
it's a bit opaque in the front, the skirt.
it's two different thicknesses!
you can see right through it.
don't get carried away.
no, but...
excuse me, I can see her legs!
I can see her legs even under these lights.
I make dresses for women who actually wear them.
tomorrow I have to do more fittings for the collection.
yesterday morning, I woke up and I had this dress on my mind.
a white dress that I would like to do.
something very playful.
short or long? - No, long, long.
it's nice here. - Beautiful.
we'll stop on Via Veneto for a second.
via Veneto, no! - Yes!
what for? - For a coffee.
we can tell the story of how we met.
no. No.
but it's important! Everything began there.
no, no, no, no. I'm not interested.
it's my nature, you know.
I only remember the things I want to remember.
I don't recognize any of these stores anymore.
but Gargani is still here.
I haven't walked on Via Veneto since the days of La Dolce Vita.
la Dolce Vita was very, very early, and it was in the middle of the 50s, close to the 60s.
via Veneto was the place where you'd stay at night and watch all the famous people passing by.
and the famous people were Sophia Loren, Anita Ekberg, Elizabeth Taylor.
you know, important people come here, they make news, we take pictures...
I was in Rome for a very, very short time.
Yes, there were a few pictures of me around.
so there was a lot of publicity about this young, young designer arriving from Paris and opening this grand...
because when Valentino started, he thought that fashion should be like in Paris:
so a huge house, models arriving from France.
this is not Cafe de Paris.
it was the 31st of July, 1960, and I was sitting at this table in a very, very crowded cafe, which was the Cafe De Paris, as it was called.
suddenly, somebody came to me and said "Are you alone?
I said "Yes." "Oh, would you mind if we sit?
we are three friends here.
he said "I've seen your pictures on the cover of the magazine.
I would love to see your fashion house.
and he came, and it was my first fashion house.
I am positive it's here that we met, because you stayed here, and I went to get the car...
I drove around, and I picked you up here.
the second reason is, my father had an open account here, so I always came here when I had no money.
I'm sorry, but I remember it was the bar across the street.
in September, we all came back from vacation
I understand that Valentino had problems because the company went bankrupt.
the first Valentino company.
and that's when I arrived but I didn't have any experience.
I was just a student.
I had a little, maybe, better good sense than Valentino, better understanding about 3 plus 3 makes 6.
and strange enough, the moment that we met, the moment that we start to work together, luck changed completely.
when did you realize that your moment had come?
it was a few years ago, when many ladies from the international society, beautiful and important ladies, decided to dress with my clothes.
this is the case with Mrs. Kennedy, whom I've been dressing for two years now, and I do her entire wardrobe.
and in '68, I did a white, white collection.
all the magazines, Time, Life, they wrote fantastic articles about it.
this was my beginning, the beginning of my career.
with all the silver screen movie stars.
a short strap of tulle here, with three or four volants that start large on top and finish thin where it meets the bustier.
I want to put the belt here with a diamond feather.
very beautiful, okay?
how long will it take you to cut the strips?
tomorrow we'll try them all to see the full effect.
day after tomorrow? - Yes.
so they should all start from here?
five in the front and five in the back.
one, two, three, four...
it starts from the center.
one, two, three...
one, two...
no, you got it wrong.
one, two, three and four...
nine, so they're divided evenly.
twenty strips in total... No, 18.
Yes, but it'll be astonishing...
astonishing...
we need to discuss briefly the background for the high fashion show.
there it is.
so this was sent and now, we'll see it in Paris.
but remember that every strip will be decorated by millions of silver sequins.
that one? - Yes.
that's the beauty of it, all these sparkling sequins.
but how will they do it?
they'll put them one by one, all by hand.
superb...
look in the mirror!
I think it's the most beautiful dress of the collection.
this is the dress that I wake up early in the morning and I was pissed off because I didn't like the previous dress, and I changed it for this one, you see.
the last minute...
the last minute you did a miracle of the collection.
no, but you must see it in the mirror.
look at your masterpiece!
your most beautiful dress ever.
look for a second. Isn't it divine?
it's beautiful like this even without the sequins.
it's so beautiful that maybe we don't need the sequins.
you already have the effect.
look at the movement!
what should we do?
without?
girls, but some sequins can't hurt.
just a little, not much.
I must see at least one strip with sequins by 4: 00 tomorrow.
you're in charge of that.
and then I will decide if I like it or not.
we'll do one by hand.
I'll hold it for you. - Yes.
it looks incredible. - Incredible.
frankly, I don't dislike it when some strips are missing.
I don't dislike it.
it makes it more light.
I would leave the front like that and group them by two in the back.
and in the front, I would continue.
incredible.
thank you. See you in Paris.
thank you.
good morning. How are you all?
why didn't you do this before, Maddelana?
this was the most important thing.
this should have been stitched better.
it's a full day's work!
why didn't you do it sooner?
you're all old ladies, and you still don't know how to handle yourselves.
this really makes me crazy.
really insane.
now I don't need anything!
it should've been done sooner.
good morning.
good morning, Antonietta.
where is dress number 70?
they aren't leaving yet.
what number is that? - Seventy-four.
this is the last piece.
we are done.
they will film Monsieur in five minutes and then be ready.
no, Monsieur is leaving right now.
put it inside the car!
okay.
sometimes I don't know which language I'm speaking anymore.
strange.
go away. Go away, go away.
where is Princess Rosario?
she's already gone into Paris. She'll meet you for lunch.
but Bruno's coming? - He's in the car.
where in the car? - No, Bruno...
they're staying here, sir. - They're staying here?
you don't need anyone, do you?
okay. - Got that part done.
this is my partner, Matteo Marzotto.
of course, you met him, and know about him.
can you lower the music a second?
and we get along very well.
I make him spend a lot of money.
that's right.
and I teach him one good lesson.
at least every day, one every day.
I've been always tempted to sell the business to someone who could run it with me, help me.
the business was getting enormous, enormous, enormous.
so I was always thinking, "Maybe I'm not good enough,
I'm not rich enough. I'm not smart enough.
so I was always thinking and listening to people
Oh, why don't you associate with me?
why don't we buy the company?
and indeed in 1998, among emotional tears, the company is sold to HDP Corp, who sold it only four years later to the Marzotto group.
the new owners gave Matteo Marzotto, the president of the company, all financial decisions.
I think Giancarlo understood the market and sold the company exactly at the right time.
this a really tough cookie, you know.
we have had the most bloody, most terrible fights, me and him.
he can be such a difficult guy, as well as being a very sweet one.
but I don't think Valentino would have been the same without Giancarlo.
not even a half, and not even one third of it.
try to think how long is this relationship, which is 365 days a year, 24 hours since 50 years.
I mean, this is unique.
and you cannot even say it's for the money, for the power, for the what?
there are two strips missing, no?
I did it on purpose. It was too much.
it looks like two holes.
do you have two extra strips?
then put them in the back here.
one here and one there.
you're a pain in the ass.
it looked fine without the strips.
there are two holes.
if you don't like, we won't put them.
just because someone else said it.
I left two holes on purpose, not to have strips all around.
but put them back, if people are going to faint over the matter.
the most beautiful gown, and you make such a mess.
it's beautiful, anyway.
look, Sergio.
I would like to recreate this kind of atmosphere.
this is a collection from 1967.
I've seen this picture before!
it's famous.
we had filled the press room with semolina.
we'll make the dunes a little bigger on the stage.
Enzo, come here for a second.
I see two tits,
I don't see two dunes.
it's a little too...
it's a little harsh like this.
make it softer, less boom boom.
this one is the little dune.
here comes the big one.
listen. it's too late now, but are you sure about the sand?
what? - The sand on the stage.
it looks like Marilyn Monroe is about to come out with Jack Lemmon running after her.
please.
it would have made sense if I made light pants,
saharan jackets, etc.
but this collection is all about romanticism, and you give me sand.
it'll be beautiful.
but that's not the question!
the problem is that it does not go with the clothes.
all right, but...
once you get an idea in your head...
and you're not stubborn?
almost never...
maybe sometimes. - Of course, never.
just imagine...
usually you ask me first.
this sand idea is ridiculous.
your belly is showing.
no, I don't have a belly. I don't look fat.
look at you with your three layers.
you will see. People will say it.
we're just missing the rifles.
what will people say? - Rifles and a lion.
what are you saying?
it's a very light collection, so...
with a beach of sand?
the lightness, the beach...
not a beach, a desert!
a desert. That's even worse...
camels with veils up to here.
we'll see what she says.
you have to say the truth, okay?
many, many years ago, when we started my career, we did a beautiful...
it's too long, this story. - Ah, it's too long.
you go away, you're scared.
you know, I'm still amazed when Valentino arrives to the show and to see a set.
Yeah, he pass by, "Oh nice!
do you like?" "Yes" and he goes.
I mean, the problems do not touch him.
he doesn't realize really the work behind this business, behind a sketch and a dress.
he's already working on the hair.
since you haven't yet discussed it with him...
I told him to start one chignon.
but he also wants to try something else.
very Guy Bourdin...
a girl with a strong look.
the hair all up and blown out?
if you're in that mood... - But I don't want that.
look at it first. It's really artistic.
if you haven't slept and you're in a bad mood...
no Guy Bourdin.
I want a chignon with this collection.
it gets worse everyday.
so, what you would love to do?
I'm gonna do something a bit more edgy and big and wild, kind of Guy Bourdin-ish.
you don't like chignons?
I mean, I was going to try a chignon.
but I was thinking something a little bit more edgy.
I don't want a crazy girl.
I want beautiful but something strong also.
this... You do all this twirl...
Yeah, volume, but there's kind of a softness.
but it's extreme because it's big.
then if a fly gets in...
it's lost forever.
this girl with the red chignon, but the other one, no.
to be with Valentino as a friend, as a lover, as a... As an employee is a bit the same...
you need a lot of patience.
listen. Can I talk to you for a second?
you just brushed me away like this.
Cheri, please, a bomb is going to explode here.
look at my hand shaking!
I've been working for 40 hours straight.
I don't give a damn.
I'm working 40 hours in Paris too.
I'm infuriated... - You have the camera behind you.
I don't care.
that camera, if it keeps on screwing around,
I'm out of the film.
which camera? - That camera there.
this is why you called me?
no, I called you because during the collection, they can't follow whomever.
they have to follow me!
who are "they"?
everyone!
why did you call me? - Why? Because I see nothing gets done here.
people have to be on their knees in front of me!
can we see the sun moving?
it's beautiful now.
you'll see with the light tonight...
it's a fantasy.
once Mr. Valentino has seen them, we'll take them out.
so, what do you think of the stage?
beautiful.
merry Christmas.
already?
will it fit? - It fits me.
I put this underneath? - Yes, underneath.
fantastic.
it will be great for the new year.
how are you? Happy New Year.
you know, it's every season we bite our nails thinking, "Could this be the last one he's gonna do?
because he deserves to take some time off now but...
we'll see, we'll see.
I can understand when Valentino gets nervous if someone is too much asking about his future.
we are just one hour, eh? - We are gonna make it.
one hour. - One hour.
Valentino is the last couturier.
he's the real thing.
but if there will be soon a day in which he says, "I want to slow down," I'd understand it.
Valentino as an icon has to decide what to do.
and only himself can decide.
but I have to find the right Valentino of the future.
we can bring the clothes here so you can do the interview.
but I already did the interview.
giancarlo, leave me alone for a minute.
we'll do one after another, okay?
why the dunes? Why the desert?
the desert is a sort of reminiscence of Giancarlo Giammetti and myself.
he was the first to come up with fashion advertising campaigns.
and our very first campaign was all pastel colours in a landscape of dunes.
hold on a minute, this is a mess!
can you send them in order, please?
where are they now?
I come out now?
giorgio Armani.
Karl Lagerfeld was the first.
I got roses last evening with a beautiful letter, fantastic and now,
I start to receive flowers and they say, "Nobody from Italy?
and I said, "No, not yet," and now, it's Giorgio Armani.
are you ready for your award ceremony?
of course.
do you have your speech?
I wrote it the other night.
good morning, Mr. Minister.
do you mention Giammetti?
just a little at the end.
don't forget, your secretary's son just graduated from college.
in your speech, you should thank everyone who came today.
the French Republic is glad to present you with the Legion of Honor.
many friends and collaborators have followed me though my career, and I would like to mention them.
and many others I could mention if I had more time.
but my gratitude...
but my gratitude goes especially to Giancarlo Giammetti.
my partner from the very beginning who stayed by my side all these years.
I want to thank him personally from the bottom of my heart.
everything is ready. - Now it's cold.
I've ordered the heaters. They'll be here this afternoon.
just to be on the safe side.
Mr. Valentino, the two far tables, we've had to use those chairs.
Gwyneth, how are you? Let's not delay.
look at this weather.
stop fighting over this beautiful lady.
we're having Apple tomorrow evening?
Yes, you are. - Great.
it's Joan Collins.
I've seen you in the... I've seen you in the papers.
seen him in the papers?
Oh, that's wonderful.
Oh, I'll have some champagne.
Yes, congratulations to Signore Valentino Garavani.
we all feel that Valentino so deserves this award, as you do too.
I got half of it, I'm sure. I feel.
everybody is asking if you can cut those off.
but what if it rains again? - No, it won't.
they want to cut open the plastic...
Yes, but not until you're in there.
no, they're asking. They want to do it now.
because it's very warm inside.
the Comtesse de Ribes brought her own vodka.
look, it's there!
can you bear not to be here all year to see it?
when I stop working.
you will spend more time home. But you won't stop working.
I don't know. One day, I don't know.
the thing is, you can't work a bit, can you?
you either have to do it, or not do it.
many collections or nothing.
it's dangerous always for people who work so hard.
I know from my mother who worked very hard.
I was scared when she stopped working.
I thought she would have a problem.
but she doesn't?
you just be Valentino, she's now Mrs. Nayar.
all day is doing what she was doing but without the business, it's house, and it's friends.
when I'm in a city for a little while.
but I'm never more than 3 or 4 days.
no, I know. For 50 years, you've probably been doing that. Running, running.
it's always so rough.
my future, I don't know really what's going on.
I am a little confused.
I live day by day.
I love to, certainly, to prepare my collection.
but you know, I am so interested in so many other things that it is a pity not to have the time to take care also.
of course, Valentino created a world to himself and he wants to stay in that world.
you have to choose between going on until the end of your life or until somebody tell you, you know, we need somebody else now, or, you decide to go.
it is a difficult step.
the market is asking us to make different things.
we have to change.
this is the job. The job is changing, have new ideas.
and I'm not sure Valentino wants, really wants to change his, you know, own lifestyle after so many years.
it's classic. Very beautiful.
after so many decade, after so much work, after so much freedom, you can imagine me accepting
Marzotto telling me, "You are not to do this you are not to do that." I would eat them.
Valentino is above control.
Valentino is above partnership decision.
Valentino doesn't care. Valentino does what he wants.
Valentino is Valentino.
so we are here to talk about
july, 2007.
forty-five years of career...
a celebration of 45 years of Valentino's career.
and my 40th birthday, which is more important.
so on the first day, we'll have the retrospective, but it has to be different from the others.
I don't want a wax museum.
I want it to be the biggest event in the history of fashion.
I want everyone to remember it.
and of course we need a prestigious location.
where is Mr. Valentino?
and Dr. Festi.
for your retrospective show, from your first day to the last, which is never, but let's say up to now, we're talking about a big party for...
how many people?
200, 000 people. Plus our friends...
six hundred VIP guests.
something like a rock concert.
a luxurious atmosphere with trolleys of finger food, wurst sausage, hamburger, veg food.
there will be two gigantic chandeliers coming down illuminated with ten of your most iconic dresses on each.
so it's like Cirque du Soleil?
with 200, 000 people, for the first time in the world.
I wouldn't want such an important event to be too much like a circus.
like a circus.
you know, Ara Pacis is this modern museum in the center of Rome.
so we arrived in front of the Ara Pacis.
I say, "What is this? It's so horrible.
I say, "Well, let me go inside."
so I went inside, I did six steps and I called Daniela and I said, "Daniela, move everything to Rome.
I found the place where to do the retrospective, it's in Rome.
and then we start all over again in Rome.
Valentino's grand return to Rome.
from July 6 to 8, the eternal city will celebrate 45 years of his career.
grand return. Eternal presence.
Valentino is planning a celebration worthy of the Sun King!
three days of celebration!
dinners, runway show and exhibit will take place in honour of Valentino, the creator of the famous "Valentino Red, who reigns indisputably over Italian Couture.
for me, this part has to have a lot of dresses in it.
otherwise, really, we're in trouble with Valentino.
he has told everybody 300 dresses, 300 dresses.
I can't tell him now there will be 220 to 230.
if you're saying there's a magic number, it's 300 and that's what it has to be, then we have to find a way of dealing with this.
Valentina, Antonio.
hello. Hamish. How do you do?
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.
let's look at the model.
Ristead, did you see this?
so this is the idea, you will arrive here and you will see all this scene and then we have to choose one amazing gown for here.
like a super-iconic thing, like the Julia Roberts thing or something.
being back in my city because it's 45 years of my career
I am trying to put together a show extremely Haute Couture.
a very, very important collection.
this would be for the couture show.
it's amazing, no?
the only bad thing is this terrible thing they put in the middle.
this is a much better room. - Okay.
you have to be so brave and so strong to talk to Valentino.
well, I mean, that's not difficult.
not difficult, right. You don't know the gentleman.
but I feel sad to show there.
I don't feel comfortable.
the entrance is very sad. - But he's going to change...
but you have walls and they're higher than this room.
they are so dirty.
Valentino, because you've never been to the Beaux Arts in Paris.
it's dirty, disgusting when you get there.
we do couture there.
you've never been in a place before we do the installation.
don't worry. Trust me.
one spends his whole life dealing with something that is not working and turning it into something that is working.
that is what we do.
and you will have your 300 dresses in the Ara Pacis.
the 300 dresses. You still like the Ara Pacis?
I like what's happening to the Ara Pacis, and I like where we're going.
I think it's going to be...
no, but you know, I never liked Ara Pacis, as you know.
those little stairs, and they go down with all these little things, you look like you are at Macy's.
he hates the rails.
well, we don't want to have nasty rails.
I think it's very beautiful. - So we discussed China...
not just China, it's Marco Polo's voyage.
more Oriental than just Chinese.
no.
this is Chinese meets Russian Ballet.
Valentino... fashion...
where he gets a fantasy, he mixes Russia with China.
that's what I want to explain to our guests.
something of a fantasy of a couturier.
for the other night, we have this amazing location where only the Pope can go once a year.
we're thinking more open air night club.
like a big party.
this is where we're gonna put the columns, - and the real columns are here. - These are fibreglass, here, and they are going to change lighting.
where did you decide to put the bathrooms?
but Valentino just called me from the airport and said: "If the bathrooms are set up like that, I'm not coming."
just to simplify things.
look!
we've got all these things here.
what should we do, cover the columns?
I'm afraid it's becoming too much of a Chinese temple.
why Chinese?
I can tell Valentino's Oriental fantasies...
you said, "The Last Emperor.
the Coliseum turns Valentino Red.
and the flying dancers arrive.
you like it? - Beautiful. Very beautiful.
Really?
I find it beautiful too.
how much would this show cost?
220 thousand Euros.
we'll give him 200.
I'll take care of it. You're breaking my balls.
two hundred. End of story.
what is next? The numbers?
hello.
good morning.
I'm sorry, but Mr. Valentino is travelling.
he doesn't like to wait. He likes skiing!
so you have to be ready with your sticks in hand.
then it's non-stop from the top to the bottom.
I went too fast. - That asshole bumped into me.
he doesn't like very much.
Michael, can you call at home Mr. Giammetti to see if he's there?
Hello?
Ciao, Giancarlo.
how are you?
I'm well.
why you don't come here for one day, I mean, to stay with us? It would be nice.
okay, ciao. Now, because the two of us, we speak French most of the time.
when I arrived from France, for me, it was really my second language and I was much too used to speak French.
so I teach him the French language and after...
I always direct him...
direct myself to him in French.
I am a special case because it went for so long, and in our case, it's probably a miracle because I've never seen two people so close for so many years not being married.
you understand that I've seen Valentino almost every day in my life, except for maybe in 45 years a total of two months.
Valentino is an Italian dress designer whose name is known around the world.
in the 70s and 80s, Valentino and I worked very hard to grow the company.
and the company became 30-40 times larger.
in the 70s, we really grew business in a normal way:
selling clothes.
in the 80s, it completely changed.
licensing.
and then in the 90s, started the investment of other people.
today there's another language which is money.
there has been a lot of news about how Valentino needs more handbags, more belts, more fragrances, and all the things that are really making most fashion houses all the money.
the runway shows, the Couture shows, they really don't make money.
those are the image things, they get the name out there, and then, it's all the other accessories that really bring it all in.
you know, we are from North East of Italy so we have to take care of figures, not only style.
today's designer is more of a manager attitude than pure creativity.
one of our needs is being on the market and looking around and try to have an idea as to what's on the next, let's say.
I've been looking at designers since many, many years.
almost immediately after we sold the company in 1998.
I knew that one day
Valentino will decide to stop.
you know, Matteo can say anything he wants but Matteo has no power in this company.
he's a young guy, very simpatico,
I like him as a friend.
but whatever he says has no value to me.
Rome
an evening dress that reveals a woman's ankles while she's walking is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.
I've never done it in my entire career.
this is Euro news with the news on the hour.
almost 30% of the Valentino Fashion Group founded by 75-year-old Valentino Garavani, has been purchased by private equity firm Permira for 782 million Euros.
the luxury sector as well as the fashion sector could be affected.
the shares were sold by members of Italy's Marzotto family.
permira is now the largest investor in Valentino and says it's looking to buy a larger stake.
despite the buyout, Matteo Marzotto will be remaining as chairman of Valentino.
when will we know about the future of Valentino?
I think it is something that would be very, very fast with a tender offer,
stefano Sassi CEO, Valentino Fashion Group and we're expecting that in 1, up to 2 months, the Permira group would be really in charge of everything and in control of the majority of the company.
fashion is such a huge business now, and investment bankers are really determining the future of this.
and Valentino wasn't consulted on any of these developments that are happening about the sale of the company.
Valentino has a contract through July, as I understand it, which possibly could be renewed and is likely not to be.
if I were he, I would say, "Take me out, but only feet first.
it's possible that this company could make the mistake and take it the way of, you know,
HALSTON in the past, or Cardin, which is belt buckles and duty free handbags and, you know, crapola.
we are in the position to wait and see.
we are sure that if somebody buys for such a huge amount of money, they don't want to destroy that kind of special product
Valentino did all his life...
but that doesn't mean you're going to retire?
no. - But rumours said that...
rumours, rumours, they say so many things.
this was the best thing for me, to design and create dresses.
I always did this. I am not capable of doing anything else.
I am a disaster in everything else.
nobody knows.
is he leaving? Staying? Leaving? Staying?
it's all backroom gossip.
let's hope he stays!
without Mr. Valentino here...
my first suit. Embroidered suit.
sixties. This is '66.
this was Audrey Hepburn. - Right.
fantastic. - Yeah, I did for her.
so, what we've tried to do, also, is try to get a lot of early things...
Anne Bass.
to do this embroidery today, you need to sell an Italian bank.
I know, look at the quality.
incredible.
so many things I did.
this is Jackie.
if I have to flashback to all those past decades...
they went so... so...
like yesterday, but time you become older and older and older, you don't realize
this grand event in Rome...
there has been talk about the past.
how does the future look?
this is something that I will decide.
for now, I'm not discussing it.
do you have a plan for retirement?
do you plan for retirement?
not for the moment. - Not for the moment.
because people ask why 45th year anniversary's a big deal, - and why not? - That means...
if you see me today like I am, it's 45, I can go until 50, 60,
I don't know, forever, okay.
what will happen with Permira?
they are a very serious corporation.
so we certainly expect growth.
how was I?
great.
tell me the truth. - Okay, I'll tell you...
you look a bit too tan.
tan? No.
a little less wouldn't hurt.
so now it's too much?
you didn't speak with Matteo at all?
what? - Matteo. You ignored him?
he said my e-mail was so tough that he didn't even reply.
we've been fighting really bad words and really, you know, with a vein like this on the neck, really high pressure.
now he's trying to say something.
he's like an old lion, you know, he's trying to roar, like this, but there is no voice.
it's a different way of thinking.
it's more about what is the bottom line.
I never thought this was the way to do business.
I always did business because I want his clothes to be on women, on men, for Valentino to be famous, to be happy.
this is the finale?
for the finale, it should be this one.
all in crystal with the pink coat.
then we go to black.
giancarlo, I don't want to see these pins around!
I don't care about the collection.
my dogs are much more important.
all the pink ones.
they'll be amazing as a finale.
no red finale for the 45th year?
no, enough with the red!
the red dresses are the most simple and stupid ones.
eleven girls with two dresses each makes 22.
twenty-four girls. Is that good for you?
but let's not hire any midgets.
so it's been a long work, this, no?
it's been a one-year work.
and he's very excited I guess, no, Valentino?
Yeah, seems so.
I try as always to leave it to him the nice part of the event and to keep all the problems for myself.
permira just confirmed that they are in the process of acquiring an additional 24%%% stake in Valentino.
according to the Wall Street Journal, the fate of Valentino is now in the hands of financiers, and it's unclear whether Valentino would stay on under a new owner.
Allesandra Facchinetti, who replaced Tom Ford as Gucci's womenswear designer, is the frontrunner to succeed Valentino, should he retire later this summer, according to Women's Wear Daily.
it would be very much the end of an era for many reasons.
there's really no one who can replace or succeed Valentino because if you weren't learning about Couture in the 1950s from people who learned the craft in the 1920s, you're not gonna get any more information.
Valentino will celebrate his 45th anniversary in the biz with a couture show in Rome on July 6th.
many believe the anniversary bash is a sign that Valentino will retire soon.
Valentino has denied those reports.
they will have shoes, all of them.
Yes.
Yes, you're not sure... - No, no, for sure.
we've been painting the soles.
that last row is a little high.
you don't like it?
not at all. I think it's terrible.
imagine it with all the lights.
Yes, but you really have to look up a lot.
you have to look up a lot.
please stop, I want to say something to Mr. Giammetti.
I don't want to be filmed.
these are my most beautiful dresses.
tell them yourself.
to me, they answer, "No, it's beautiful.
but what will they do now? It's too late.
Yes, but all of this is going to be...
I am here to decide something very important and I don't want to be filmed. I'm sorry.
okay, otherwise I go. And I go. Bye-bye.
no, come here and finish this thing.
it's a shame because he's so enthusiastic about the other things.
Valentino is very protective of himself.
he doesn't like to confide in anyone.
ever.
not even friends...
few people know about his doubts, his fears, his weaknesses.
therefore, he has this extraordinary control.
you see my dogs. They're used to pictures.
come here, come here!
little idiot.
we have to do damage control because the situation at the Temple of Venus has become tragic and will get worse little by little.
just today there are 5 or 8 extra guests from Permira.
he was invited to Ara Pacis but not to the Temple of Venus.
but he has to be invited to the Temple.
Mr. Giammetti told me only Ara Pacis, but I'll add him.
we must add him because he did the thing...
let's do a final check.
so guys, imagine I am a guest.
I will arrive to the hotel with my six big bags, there will be somebody out waiting for me from the hotel.
then I'm sent to the room. I will have my gift.
in each hotel, there is going to be a room, a suite with a hairdresser, a manicurist, and make-up.
are you ready?
how beautiful you are!
look at me in Valentino Red!
your boobs are all hanging out.
because it's small. It's the model size.
look, it fits me.
can I go out like this?
it's extraordinary! Beautiful!
you think it's too small?
just a little bit here.
not much.
you think it'd be good for an evening?
of course!
first or second night? - First!
you didn't even call me to say "Welcome to Rome.
beautiful!
Oh, my God! Fabulous!
my first couture with Valentino, it's better late than never.
Oh, it's so extraordinary, and it's so Valentino.
you should have made me one for every hour.
Oh, my God! I cannot even tell you.
it's a little bit long, yes,
I think it needs to be hemmed up. She has a lot of work.
lavoro, tanto lavoro. Tanto lavoro, capice, capice.
Hi, Valentino! How are you doing?
we're taking amazing pictures!
the Coliseum, look! Let's go!
we're in Rome, where the fashion world has congregated for the festivities surrounding the 45th anniversary celebration of Valentino.
we'll bring you complete coverage of this extraordinary weekend on an upcoming episode of Fashion Television.
I'm rushing because I'm late.
did you go inside?
Valentino, you have to put this on for me.
it's not on right. - What do you mean? It's done!
being in Rome, it's so hot and steamy and romantic.
Uma, can we have a quick comment?
is that Valentino? - Yes, it is.
she's wearing Valentino as well. Couture.
what's the difference between good style and trash?
I have no idea.
marvellous!
you look amazing!
look at your tits.
he said "I have a wonderful Italian intern who has no money.
he will be happy to do your sketches.
and this is how we met.
how amazing.
today, we are here to celebrate with our friends, our colleagues this amazing career of my dear friend Valentino.
and he still designs the same way, fame and fortune didn't change him.
he's still the same little guy I met 45 years ago.
I need Antonio!
Mr. Valentino's coming!
come on! Don't be shy.
all the seamstresses from Turin made the trip.
wonderful!
it's fantastic...
look at this one from 1990!
from the beginning...
1966!
incredible!
it's beautiful!
1965
Congratulations. I can't believe it.
our creation.
where is Mr. Lagerfeld? - He's downstairs.
come see something you're going to love.
how does it feel to see it all again?
darling, it's the hard work of 45 years.
this is Patrick.
he did all this scenography.
Congratulations. - Thank you, thank you.
it's pretty, hung up like this.
you realize the hours of work for all this.
it's crazy.
I kind of remember these looks.
this one, for instance. - It's the 60s.
I remember very well.
you were still on Via Gregoriana.
Congratulations! You must stay a few more years.
maybe not another 45, but still...
don't stop. - Not at all.
I would never forgive you. - Never.
thank you for coming.
be strong, sophisticated, very feminine, and show what is Haute Couture.
everybody's here.
the pace has to be very strong and fast.
go, go, go.
no, she's not ready.
we need powder!
did you see?
Bravo, bravo!
not me, not me.
not me, not me.
that's the way it should be done.
compared to us, the rest are making rags.
every dress, every girl, every moment of a feather or ruffle.
there's so much restraint and exuberance.
that pink thing that looked like...
it's just another... It's a breakthrough moment here.
triumph of the will. Triumph of the will.
the will to continue to be.
you're just beginning. You're just beginning over.
your career is just beginning. You're a little guy about to begin.
I'm beginning my career.
you're beginning your career again, today.
the world today...
the world of fashion today is very, very different.
if there is a reason for Valentino to stop one day, that's the reason...
that this is not a world made for him.
Valentino will be the last one of that generation of the big names that has still his name on his company.
it will define the difference between yesterday and today.
there are a lot of people who say no one can replace you.
after me, the flood.
you know what it means?
it was beautiful.
go crazy, big guy.
Hey, guys.
quest for fire...
...over. Knock yourselves out.
morning, dum-dum.
me no dum-dum. You dum-dum. You bring me gum-gum?
Yes, I did, fathead. Lots and lots of gum-gum.
what's that? I can't hear you through the glass.
sorry.
heave.
heave. Heave.
Hey, what's going on over here?
we expand or we die.
heave.
heave. - On the count of three...
...you blow this anthill to kingdom come.
and a one and a two... - Hey, Jed. Stop that.
no, no. You blow a hole in your mountain, all you're gonna hit is a wall.
step aside, Gigantor. We got us a railroad to build. We're blowing a hole in that thing.
okay, first of all, enough with the Gigantor giant stuff, okay?
I'm just trying to close up shop. - We're gonna blow it anyway. And a three!
Yeah. What are you doing?
what's it look like we're doing? It's manifest destiny.
you can't fight it and neither can I. Go! More dynamite.
Yeah, use it all. - All right. Okay.
listen, "Octavus"? You gotta stop that.
it's Octavius, mary.
okay, you know what? Fine. Great. Here you go. This is what happens.
you cannot do this. I am a Roman general. - Sorry.
I have rights. - And you.
Hey, no! Put me down! - Keep heaving, men.
you can't stop progress!
we're gonna have a little talk, okay?
I told you, I don't like to be manandled.
no, I will manandle you, Jedediah. Now, listen, guys.
what is your problem, huh? Why can't you just get along?
look, we're men. We fight, okay? That's what we do.
it's kind of how we pass the time.
you're, like, a giant. A freak, if you will. We can't expect you to understand that.
you got the whole room to run around in. You don't have to be near each other.
what, you mean...? - You're gonna let us out?
what, and just roam free?
Yeah. Yeah, I might, if you promise to behave.
that means no fireballs, no explosions, okay?
you have my word, my liege.
Yeah, no problemo, Gigantor.
my name's Larry, first of all. Okay, Jed?
so I call you Jed. I don't call you Tiny, right?
what's that supposed to mean?
Hey, Teeny. How does that sound? - I don't like it. It hurts my feelings.
Gigantor" makes me feel like some sort of freak, so...
I don't. I just call you Larry.
don't be a kiss-ass, okay?
look, I'm trusting you guys, all right?
if you don't do what I say, you can end up like the Mayan world there.
locked up. Take a look.
do they look happy? - No.
they look sad.
they can't do what they wanna do. Now, I'm letting you guys...
...have a little bit of leash here. Don't choke me with it, okay?
I gotta run. You guys play nice, okay? Okay. Good. Thanks.
Hey, how's that gum treating you, dum-dum?
good.
Oh, hey, Dexter. I'm just locking up. You want in?
yeah?
all right.
what's that? You got my keys?
I don't think so.
looks like Uncle Larry pulled a fast one on little Dexie.
those are baby keys for a little baby.
have fun with your baby keys, little baby monkey.
tomorrow I'll bring you a little baby diapy so you can go poo-poo in it.
I'll give you a tickle because you're a cute baby.
while you cry all night long about how Uncle Larry fooled you, huh?
I told you there was a storm coming.
Hey, Teddy. - Lawrence.
you impertinent pup. I knew you'd come back.
you look like a man on a mission. - Yeah, I'm gonna give it another shot.
you...? - What?
you checking her out? - The nerve.
checking her out. I've never heard of such a thing.
no, no, no. I'm just... I mean because, you know, she's very beautiful.
beautiful? - Yeah.
rather handsome woman, I suppose. - Yeah.
I don't know, maybe you should go talk to her.
indeed. Bless you, lad. - Yeah. All right.
carry on. - Good. See you.
I...
Hey, hi.
No! It's okay! It's okay. You guys speak English?
no?
right. I don't know what that means...
...and I know that you and I got off on the wrong foot last night, but...
...a little birdie told me that somebody likes...
...magic.
magic? - Magic.
sorcery.
Ah, sorcer...
Yes. Illusion.
everybody likes magic.
and flowers. People like flowers.
there you go. Those are for you.
you know what else people like? Money.
the almighty dollar, right? But money can sometimes...
...disappear.
at least that's what I...
...hear.
no wonder you can't understand me. You got a coin in your ear.
check this out. Anybody need a hanky?
well, I wouldn't suggest this little feller because he has a nasty habit...
...of vanishing...
...into thin air!
no, no. Don't. That defeats the... Don't!
not the limbs. Guys, please, do not tear the limbs.
cortes, right?
how?
you! Don't even think about it. Don't you...
Dexter!
come on, guys!
Hey, guys!
Hey, guys. Hey, guys!
sorry. What's going on? What happened here?
I thought we had a deal.
we will never coexist with these buffoons.
we're past words, Laredo.
now it's time to let Smith & Wesson do the talking!
those guns don't even work.
Dexter!
Why?
ho! Dexter.
end of the line, cool breeze.
end of the line.
I am not playing games here.
just hand them over.
easy. That's it, Dexter.
nice and easy, Dex. That's it.
good Lord, Lawrence! Why are you slapping a monkey?
Teddy, this guy's been pushing me, and I'm sick of it!
poppycock. This little creature is your primate brother.
without him, there's no us.
are you rabid?
wipe that off.
you have to deal with this creature with love and respect.
may I have the keys, dear friend?
thank you. Lawrence?
well, you know what?
you seem to know what you're doing, so I'm gonna let you take over.
no, no. My dear boy, you can't put up the white flag now.
the museum is on the verge of total anarchy.
I tried! I came back tonight, didn't I?
tried? That was one night. I didn't build the Panama Canal in one day.
that's great, but I'm dealing with the most ridiculous job in history.
some men are born great, Lawrence...
Yeah, I know. Others have greatness thrust upon them.
you hit me with that chestnut last night.
the thing is, not everyone is great.
that's the problem. Some of us are just ordinary.
no, you're not, Lawrence. Stop wallowing in self-pity.
every journey begins with a footstep.
teach the inabitants to get along, they wouldn't need to be locked up.
that means a lot coming from a guy who's spent the last 50 years...
I was going to make contact. Lawrence, please.
I'm done, all right?
no, Rexy! No!
Oh, no.
all right.
no one comes here anymore. Besides, I took this tour in second grade, Daley.
I'm telling you, my dad's gonna hook us up.
Mr. Daley? - Yeah?
foam. - Yes, I know.
in the Neanderthal display.
there was an incident last night with the fire extinguisher.
I was on my way to go clean it up.
okay, don't bother. You're fired.
I don't think we're getting a tour today.
your dad just got canned, dude.
excuse me?
Mr. McPhee?
excuse me, Mr. McPhee?
can I talk to you about this, please?
sir? - What?
I know I screwed up, but I finally understand how to do this job.
you obviously don't. - No, I didn't, but now I do.
really, Mr. McPhee... - Doctor.
Dr. McPhee.
can you please give me one more night?
one more night. - Okay, thank you.
and if anything is the tiniest...
...after your shift:
because...
got it. - Okay?
fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...
shame on me. Fool me... Shame on me.
you. - Fool me twice... Got it.
take it or leave it. - Okay. Thank you.
Hey. - Hey.
what's wrong? - Maybe you should ask Nicky.
Hey, buddy. What's going on?
you got fired.
what are you talking about? I didn't get fired.
I came to the museum this morning. I saw your boss yelling at you.
why didn't you tell me? Everything's fine.
we just had a little misunderstanding.
Why?
it's hard to explain. I mean, you wouldn't bel...
you know what? Let me show you.
show me what? - Come to work with me tonight.
Larry?
can I talk to you for a second?
am I in trouble?
Larry, what are you doing?
I just wanna show him what I do. That's all.
I love that you wanna share that with him, but I gotta tell you...
...I don't think Nicky has any room in his heart for more disappointment.
he won't be disappointed.
Larry.
he won't be disappointed.
listen, hang out in the security office till everyone's gone.
then I'm gonna come get you. All right?
Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you to vacate the premises.
hey there. - Hey.
good place to think, huh? - Yeah. Definitely.
so no big plans tonight?
Yeah, no, I'm not really a big-plan person.
I prefer hanging out with people who are dead for 200 years.
it's the live ones that throw me.
that's cool. Seriously though, you do have to leave.
Seriously? - Yeah, sorry. It's museum rules.
we're sort of locking everything up.
you're really taking your job seriously.
you know, once I clip on the tie, I'm all business.
I get it. - Yeah.
how's that dissertation coming?
I've hit a dead end. I mean, research can only get me so far.
I'm never gonna know who she really was.
so I think it's time that I move on to another subject.
I'll let you get back to work.
good night, Larry. - Yeah, okay.
night.
Hey.
Rebecca!
Hey, Rebecca. - Hey.
Hey. Listen, I don't think you should give up on your paper.
okay. Why?
all right, look, this is gonna sound crazy, all right?
I mean, it's gonna sound, like, really, really crazy.
okay. - No, I mean insanely crazy.
I can handle it. - Okay.
you know how they say in certain museums, history comes alive?
Yeah. - In this museum...
...it actually does.
what are you talking about?
everything in this museum comes to life at night.
Really? - Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you.
you know that tablet? The Tablet of Ahkmenrah?
it actually brings things to life. It's like some ancient spell.
since the '50s, every night everything's been coming to life.
Teddy Roosevelt told me. Seriously. The monkey, Dexter? The cute little...
what is he? - Capuchin.
a capuchin. Right. The capuchin. He urinated on me and bit my nose.
and Sakagawea is in her case, alive every night...
...just listening to Lewis and Clark argue.
so if you really wanna get inside her head...
...I can hook that up.
that's cool.
Yeah, it's cool. It's freaking awesome.
make fun of the history geek.
no. Rebecca! - Good night, Larry.
no, I'm not making fun of you. Rebecca.
here you go. Best seat in the house. - What's going on?
if I told you, you'd think I'm crazy. I'm gonna show you.
what? - You'll see in about 20 seconds.
okay, you like Tyrannosaurus Rex? - Yeah.
yeah? Well, I call him Rexy.
and he's about to come to life, Nicholas, in...
...five, four, three, two...
dad? - Hang on a sec.
say hello to Rexy!
dad, are you okay?
this is weird.
guys! Come on!
sundown!
Hey, T. R. come on, rise and shine. Buddy, I need you to wake up.
come on, my kid is here. I need you to wake up.
Texas? Texas! Come on! Texas! Come on! Get on, Texas!
get on, Texas! Get up.
just stop, okay?
no, Nicky, I'm telling you, there's this tablet, okay?
called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. Every night...
now there's a tablet? - Yeah, there is.
come on, Dad.
come on.
it's gone. - What's gone?
the tablet. I think somebody stole it.
Yeah, right.
I'm not kidding, Nicky.
Nicky?
Hey, Nicky!
Hey! Hey, Nicky! Where are you going?
home. - What? Wait a minute.
come on.
you guys shouldn't be here.
give us the tablet, son.
wait a minute, Nicky. What are you guys doing?
we're not gonna hurt you. Give us the tablet.
I'm sorry to tell you this, son, but your dad doesn't work here.
he got fired this morning. Couldrt hack it.
dad? I thought you said you werert fired.
I did. They're lying, trying to steal that thing.
turn the middle piece, you'll see what I was talking about.
that is museum property, son. Give it back.
Nicky, trust me. Just turn it.
give us the tablet! - Nicky?
trust me.
Nick? Run. Now.
get back here, kid!
bad idea, Larry.
you wanna dance, hot dog? You wanna dance?
Gus, you're an old man. I don't wanna hurt you.
you see, Larry, a few years into the job, the three of us realized that...
...like everything else in this museum, we got new life at night.
sundown to sunrise, we felt young again.
okay. Did not see that coming.
gave us an energy boost.
we love the nightlife, Larry.
so when we found out they were gonna fired us...
...we had to steal the tablet.
everyone knows you need the money.
add the stuff we planted in your place...
...pretty obvious you committed the crime.
take care of that cut.
come on, guys, let's go find that kid.
sweet dreams, cupcake! - No!
pile driver!
let's get our tablet.
thank you very much. We'll take it from here.
Nicky!
just in time, Larry. We were just locking up.
sleep tight, hotshot.
let's grab everything we can fence.
I don't know about you, but I'm planning on a long retirement.
Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there, I need you, pal!
someone call my name?
theodore Roosevelt, at your service.
Teddy, can you get us out of here?
can't do it, man. This is your moment.
will you save the lectures, please? I'm not you. Okay?
I didn't build the Panama Canal, I wasrt president of the United States!
I need some help. Come on.
actually...
...I never did any of those things. Teddy Roosevelt did.
I was made in a mannequin factory in Poughkeepsie.
I never shot a wild beast.
I'm not even brave enough to tell that beautiful woman I love her.
but you...
...you gotta finish the job this time. You can't quit.
I'm made of wax, Larry.
what are you made of?
wait! That's all you got for me? - That's it!
that's it. Come on.
duck!
go over there!
Hey. Hi. How you doing? Sorry to bother you...
...but your guys there? Your jackal guys?
do you think you could ask them to back off, please?
we're not trying to hurt you, they think we are. Could you do it like now?
thank you. Nicky.
thank you.
dad?
you would not believe how stuffy it is in there.
how come you speak English? - I went to Cambridge University.
you went to Cambridge?
I was on display in the Egyptology Department.
I am Ahkmenrah, fourth king of the fourth king...
...ruler of the land of my fathers.
I am Larry...
...son of Milton...
...and this is my son, Nick.
and we hail from Brooklyn.
well, I do. I mean, he comes out and stays with me on Wednesdays...
...and every other weekend.
that was the custody agreement that we had.
Larry, Nick, guardians of Brooklyn...
...I am forever in your debt.
now bestow the tablet upon me...
...so that I may assume command of my kingdom.
Oh, yes. Okay, the tablet. I would...
...Iove to bestow it upon you, but we don't actually...
...have it.
Thanks, guys. Don't worry. I'll watch out for him!
thank you.
what is that?
Huns.
I gotta deal with this guy.
pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun.
he says that he wants to rip you apart.
all right. Again with the ripping. Listen, I understand.
I get it. Ripping for you... You want to rip things, okay?
and I think maybe that's because somebody ripped you a long time ago.
in here.
somebody ripped little...
...baby Attila a long time ago, right here.
they ripped something out, didn't they?
they ripped the love.
they ripped the love right out of you, didn't they?
a little baby all alone in a tent...
...whose daddy went off...
...to pillage some town...
...or go and plunder somewhere, just doing his job.
but who was left alone?
you.
let it out. Let it go. Let it go.
it's okay. It's okay.
you're next.
good. That's good. Just breathe.
Larry Daley. - Yeah.
good. Yes.
Yeah. Okay. Good, good.
all right! I need everybody to listen up!
guys! Come on!
quiet!
my dum-dum want to speak.
thank you.
now, this here's King Ahkmenrah.
his tablet is what brings you to life every night.
and those old night watchmen? They stole it.
now, we need to find those guards and get the tablet back...
...and we need to do it before morning.
civil War guys, head over to the Planetarium Wing.
my explorer friend whose name escapes me.
it's Columbus. - Right, Columbus! Right, I'm sorry.
there's no nameplate, so... Columbus, take the Neanderthals...
...and do a sweep from Invertebrates all the way through Reptiles.
jed and Octavius, their vars parked out back. Go take care of it.
whoa, whoa, whoa, no! No, sir. I ain't working with toga boy.
Romans work alone.
that didn't hurt. Don't be a baby. - Yes, it did.
come on.
that was much harder!
guys, come on!
Jed, Octavius.
take away the fact you were born 2000 years apart...
...you guys aren't that different.
you're both great leaders.
you just want what's best for your people, right?
Yeah. - Yeah.
civil War dudes.
you guys are brothers, for God's sakes. You gotta stop fighting.
north wins. Slavery's bad. Sorry.
don't wanna burst your bubble. But, South, you guys get Allman Brothers...
...and NASCAR, so just chill!
look, without that tablet, all of this...
...this whole coming-to-life-at-night thing, it all goes away.
now, I don't wanna let that happen, but I need your help.
we can get this done, but we gotta do it together.
so who's with me?
Yeah.
who's with me? - Yeah!
Yeah! - Charge!
all right! Now, let's do this, people!
and animals!
and weird, faceless puppet creatures. Come on, let's go! Let's do it!
come on! Follow me, boys!
Geronimo!
Oh, jeez.
now, boys, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
I guess it's gonna be the hard way.
right, men, we're almost there.
save yourself!
I ain't quitting you!
Gus?
Reginald?
fellas, where are you?
guys?
that's what I'm talking about. Good job, gentlemen.
loving the teamwork!
they've vanished. How will we find them?
I know someone who can help. Come on.
watch out!
Hey, Sakagawea, or wea. Listen, I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet.
you think you can track the guys who took it?
he went east but he lost control and crashed.
you're amazing. How can you tell that?
he left the wagon...
...and went back.
he went back?
why would he go back?
get out of the way!
you saved me.
you're won'th saving, my dear.
that's problematic. - Teddy. Oh, man.
Larry, relax. I'm wax.
you gotta do something. Dawrs approaching.
half the museum's running amuck outside. - He's got my tablet.
come on, Ockie!
at your service, Gigantor!
how can we be of assistance, my liege?
just give me a second, guys.
Rexy?
here, boy.
Teddy, I need a horse.
do it, man.
come on, boy! Let me hear you yell! - Yeah!
just living the dream, baby!
I'm loving this!
pull the stagecoach over now!
can I make this turn up here?
I'll take that as a yes. Hang on!
I can't hold it!
come on, Tex, let's finish this.
come on!
give me the tablet, Cecil!
can't do it, son.
pull over!
it ain't gonna happen. Moving on.
last chance, Cecil. Stop the horses or I will!
they can't be stopped, Larry.
don't you know your history?
these are money carriers. They were trained not to stop for anything but a secret word.
Really? You mean a word like...
..."Dakota"?
come on, Tex.
I read up on my history. Thanks for the tip.
Oh, and by the way...
...don't ever talk to me like that in front of my son.
moving on.
Hey, Huns. - Tell Attila to have his boys...
...Take him back. Put him with the guards.
Oh, and no limb ripping, okay?
Hey, boy. Wait, wait, hold the phone.
what's makeekaka mean? Wait. Translation, please.
the year was 1909. I was going up the Zambezi River in Africa.
and our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy who spoke only by clicking.
there we are.
Oh, boy. - What is it?
I gotta get you guys back to the museum.
how?
Ahkmenrah, I'm gonna need your help.
this is your tablet. You know the instructions. You get everyone back.
come on. There's somebody who's gotta see this.
what I'm saying is, for the type of money that they pay A-Rod...
...he ought to be bringing home a World Series trophy every season.
you know what I mean?
now, who they gonna get to clean up all that doo-doo?
inuit. - Yeah.
one terracotta soldier.
Vikings. - Right.
alpaca. - Welcome back, ladies.
llama. - Hey.
Viking guys.
do me a favor. Your fellows made some funeral pyre...
...in Petrified Wood. Go clean that up.
okay? Thank you.
he's back. - All right, I'll deal with this joker.
Hey, hey, Moose. It's not gonna happen, buddy. All right?
I told you, you can't come through with those antlers.
so you and your caribou buddy gotta go around to the loading dock.
Lawrence! - Hey, Teddy.
great to see you in one piece.
Sakagawea, a little hot wax, and I'm a new man.
Larry?
I told you I wasrt making fun of you.
I know. - Teddy?
Oh, my God.
wanna meet her?
yeah? - Yeah.
okay, come on.
excuse me. President Roosevelt, this is my friend Rebecca.
an honor. - Hi.
and this is Sakagawea.
Wea. - Wea.
Wea.
I think she has a few questions she wants to ask you.
you rock. I am a big fan.
what would you like to know?
well, I mean, I don't know where to start, but...
one Buddha. - Check.
two zebras.
right. Check. - Dexter! Welcome back.
Hey, Dex, so look. No hard feelings, all right?
Lawrence! - You saw!
you saw what he did just then! - Who's evolved?
I am. - Who's evolved?
I am!
good.
well, they're all here.
well done. Everyone's in.
Yeah, well...
...not everyone.
we lost a couple of good, little men out there tonight.
with great victory comes great sacrifice.
Yeah.
dad, look.
it was nice of Larry not to rat us out, but this is ridiculous.
we're night watchmen, not janitors!
gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job.
I'll gonna catch a few Z's.
you ain't going nowhere.
start mopping, hot dog.
over here.
bless you, lad. - Yeah. All right.
carry on. - Good. See you.
I...
Hey, hi.
No! It's okay! It's okay. You guys speak English?
no?
right. I don't know what that means...
...and I know that you and I got off on the wrong foot last night, but...
...a little birdie told me that somebody likes...
...magic.

Ah, sorcer...
Yes. Illusion.

and flowers. People like flowers.
there you go. Those are for you.
you know what else people like? Money.
the almighty dollar, right? But money can sometimes...
...disappear.
at least that's what I...
...hear.
no wonder you can't understand me. You got a coin in your ear.
check this out. Anybody need a hanky?
well, I wouldn't suggest this little feller because he has a nasty habit of vanishing into thin air!
no, no. Don't. That defeats the... Don't!
not the limbs. Guys, please, do not tear the limbs.
cortes, right?
how?
you! Don't even think about it. Don't you...
Dexter!
come on, guys!
Hey, guys!
Hey, guys. Hey, guys!
sorry. What's going on? What happened here?
I thought we had a deal.
we will never coexist with these buffoons.
we're past words, Laredo.
now it's time to let Smith & Wesson do the talking!
those guns don't even work.
they don't? Take a look at this.
Dexter!
Why?
ho! Dexter.
end of the line, cool breeze.
end of the line.
I am not playing games here.
just hand them over.
easy. That's it, Dexter.
nice and easy, Dex. That's it.
good Lord, Lawrence! Why are you slapping a monkey?
Teddy, this guy's been pushing me, and I'm sick of it!
poppycock. This little creature is your primate brother.
without him, there's no us.
are you rabid?
wipe that off.
you have to deal with this creature with love and respect.
may I have the keys, dear friend?
thank you. Lawrence?
well, you know what?
you seem to know what you're doing, so I'm gonna let you take over.
no, no. My dear boy, you can't put up the white flag now.
the museum is on the verge of total anarchy.
I tried! I came back tonight, didn't I?
tried? That was one night. I didn't build the Panama Canal in one day.
that's great, but I'm dealing with the most ridiculous job in history.
some men are born great, Lawrence...
Yeah, I know. Others have greatness thrust upon them.
you hit me with that chestnut last night.
the thing is, not everyone is great.
that's the problem. Some of us are just ordinary.
no, you're not, Lawrence. Stop wallowing in self-pity.
every journey begins with a footstep.
teach the inabitants to get along, they wouldn't need to be locked up.
that means a lot coming from a guy who's spent the last 50 years...
...spying on a girl he's never even talked to.
I was going to make contact. Lawrence, please.
I'm done, all right?
no, Rexy! No!
Oh, no.
all right.
no one comes here anymore. Besides, I took this tour in second grade, Daley.
I'm telling you, my dad's gonna hook us up.
Mr. Daley? - Yeah?
foam. - Yes, I know.
in the Neanderthal display.
there was an incident last night with the fire extinguisher.
I was on my way to go clean it up.
okay, don't bother. You're fired.
I don't think we're getting a tour today.
your dad just got canned, dude.
excuse me?
Mr. McPhee?
excuse me, Mr. McPhee?
can I talk to you about this, please?
sir? - What?
I know I screwed up, but I finally understand how to do this job.
you obviously don't. - No, I didn't, but now I do.
really, Mr. McPhee... - Doctor.
Dr. McPhee.
can you please give me one more night?
one more night. - Okay, thank you.
and if anything is the tiniest...
...after your shift:
because...
got it. - Okay?
fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...
shame on me. Fool me... Shame on me.
you. - Fool me twice... Got it.
take it or leave it. - Okay. Thank you.
Hey. - Hey.
what's wrong? - Maybe you should ask Nicky.
Hey, buddy. What's going on?
you got fired.
what are you talking about? I didn't get fired.
I came to the museum this morning. I saw your boss yelling at you.
why didn't you tell me? Everything's fine.
we just had a little misunderstanding.
Why?
it's hard to explain. I mean, you wouldn't bel...
you know what? Let me show you.
show me what? - Come to work with me tonight.
Larry?
can I talk to you for a second?
am I in trouble?
Larry, what are you doing?
I just wanna show him what I do. That's all.
I love that you wanna share that with him, but I gotta tell you...
...I don't think Nicky has any room in his heart for more disappointment.
he won't be disappointed.
Larry.
he won't be disappointed.
listen, hang out in the security office till everyone's gone.
then I'm gonna come get you. All right?
Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you to vacate the premises.
hey there. - Hey.
good place to think, huh? - Yeah. Definitely.
so no big plans tonight?
Yeah, no, I'm not really a big-plan person.
I prefer hanging out with people who are dead for 200 years.
it's the live ones that throw me.
that's cool. Seriously though, you do have to leave.
Seriously? - Yeah, sorry. It's museum rules.
we're sort of locking everything up.
you're really taking your job seriously.
you know, once I clip on the tie, I'm all business.
I get it. - Yeah.
how's that dissertation coming?
I've hit a dead end. I mean, research can only get me so far.
I'm never gonna know who she really was.
so I think it's time that I move on to another subject.
I'll let you get back to work.
good night, Larry. - Yeah, okay.
night.
Hey.
Rebecca!
Hey, Rebecca. - Hey.
Hey. Listen, I don't think you should give up on your paper.
okay. Why?
all right, look, this is gonna sound crazy, all right?
I mean, it's gonna sound, like, really, really crazy.
okay. - No, I mean insanely crazy.
I can handle it. - Okay.
you know how they say in certain museums, history comes alive?
Yeah. - In this museum...
...it actually does.
what are you talking about?
everything in this museum comes to life at night.
Really? - Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you.
you know that tablet? The Tablet of Ahkmenrah?
it actually brings things to life. It's like some ancient spell.
since the '50s, every night everything's been coming to life.
Teddy Roosevelt told me. Seriously. The monkey, Dexter? The cute little...
what is he? - Capuchin.
a capuchin. Right. The capuchin. He urinated on me and bit my nose.
and Sakagawea is in her case, alive every night...
...just listening to Lewis and Clark argue.
so if you really wanna get inside her head...
...I can hook that up.
that's cool.
Yeah, it's cool. It's freaking awesome.
make fun of the history geek.
no. Rebecca! - Good night, Larry.
no, I'm not making fun of you. Rebecca.
here you go. Best seat in the house. - What's going on?
if I told you, you'd think I'm crazy. I'm gonna show you.
what? - You'll see in about 20 seconds.
okay, you like Tyrannosaurus Rex? - Yeah.
yeah? Well, I call him Rexy.
and he's about to come to life, Nicholas, in...
...five, four, three, two...
dad? - Hang on a sec.
say hello to Rexy!
dad, are you okay?
this is weird.
guys! Come on!
sundown!
Hey, T. R. come on, rise and shine. Buddy, I need you to wake up.
come on, my kid is here. I need you to wake up.
Texas? Texas! Come on! Texas! Come on! Get on, Texas!
get on, Texas! Get up.
just stop, okay?
no, Nicky, I'm telling you, there's this tablet, okay?
called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah. Every night...
now there's a tablet? - Yeah, there is.
come on, Dad.
come on.
it's gone. - What's gone?
the tablet. I think somebody stole it.
Yeah, right.
I'm not kidding, Nicky.
Nicky?
Hey, Nicky!
Hey! Hey, Nicky! Where are you going?
home. - What? Wait a minute.
come on.
you guys shouldn't be here.
give us the tablet, son.
wait a minute, Nicky. What are you guys doing?
we're not gonna hurt you. Give us the tablet.
I'm sorry to tell you this, son, but your dad doesn't work here.
he got fired this morning. Couldrt hack it.
dad? I thought you said you werert fired.
I did. They're lying, trying to steal that thing.
turn the middle piece, you'll see what I was talking about.
that is museum property, son. Give it back.
Nicky, trust me. Just turn it.
give us the tablet! - Nicky?
trust me.
Nick? Run. Now.
get back here, kid!
bad idea, Larry.
you wanna dance, hot dog? You wanna dance?
Gus, you're an old man. I don't wanna hurt you.
you see, Larry, a few years into the job, the three of us realized that...
...like everything else in this museum, we got new life at night.
sundown to sunrise, we felt young again.
okay. Did not see that coming.
gave us an energy boost.
we love the nightlife, Larry.
so when we found out they were gonna fired us...
...we had to steal the tablet.
everyone knows you need the money.
add the stuff we planted in your place...
...pretty obvious you committed the crime.
take care of that cut.
come on, guys, let's go find that kid.
sweet dreams, cupcake! - No!
pile driver!
let's get our tablet.
thank you very much. We'll take it from here.
Nicky!
just in time, Larry. We were just locking up.
sleep tight, hotshot.
let's grab everything we can fence.
I don't know about you, but I'm planning on a long retirement.
Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there, I need you, pal!
someone call my name?
theodore Roosevelt, at your service.
Teddy, can you get us out of here?
can't do it, man. This is your moment.
will you save the lectures, please? I'm not you. Okay?
I didn't build the Panama Canal, I wasrt president of the United States!
I need some help. Come on.
actually...
...I never did any of those things. Teddy Roosevelt did.
I was made in a mannequin factory in Poughkeepsie.
I never shot a wild beast.
I'm not even brave enough to tell that beautiful woman I love her.
but you...
......You gotta finish the job this time. You can't quit.
I'm made of wax, Larry.
what are you made of?
wait! That's all you got for me? - That's it!
that's it. Come on.
duck!
go over there!
Hey. Hi. How you doing? Sorry to bother you...
......But your guys there? Your jackal guys?
do you think you could ask them to back off, please?
we're not trying to hurt you, they think we are. Could you do it like now?
thank you. Nicky.
thank you.
dad?
you would not believe how stuffy it is in there.
how come you speak English? - I went to Cambridge University.
you went to Cambridge?
I was on display in the Egyptology Department.
I am Ahkmenrah, fourth king of the fourth king...
...Ruler of the land of my fathers.
I am Larry...
...Son of Milton...
...and this is my son, Nick.
and we hail from Brooklyn.
well, I do. I mean, he comes out and stays with me on Wednesdays...
...and every other weekend.
that was the custody agreement that we had.
Larry, Nick, guardians of Brooklyn...
...I am forever in your debt.
now bestow the tablet upon me...
...so that I may assume command of my kingdom.
Oh, yes. Okay, the tablet. I would...
...Iove to bestow it upon you, but we don't actually...
...have it.
Thanks, guys. Don't worry. I'll watch out for him!
thank you.
what is that?
Huns.
I gotta deal with this guy.
pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun.
he says that he wants to rip you apart.
all right. Again with the ripping. Listen, I understand.
I get it. Ripping for you... You want to rip things, okay?
and I think maybe that's because somebody ripped you a long time ago.
in here.
somebody ripped little baby Attila a long time ago, right here.
they ripped something out, didn't they?
they ripped the love.
they ripped the love right out of you, didn't they?
a little baby all alone in a tent...
...whose daddy went off...
...to pillage some town...
...or go and plunder somewhere, just doing his job.
but who was left alone?
you.
let it out. Let it go. Let it go.
it's okay. It's okay.
you're next.
good. That's good. Just breathe.
Larry Daley. - Yeah.
good. Yes.
Yeah. Okay. Good, good.
all right! I need everybody to listen up!
guys! Come on!
quiet!
my dum-dum want to speak.
thank you.
now, this here's King Ahkmenrah.
his tablet is what brings you to life every night.
and those old night watchmen? They stole it.
now, we need to find those guards and get the tablet back...
...and we need to do it before morning.
civil War guys, head over to the Planetarium Wing.
my explorer friend whose name escapes me.
it's Columbus. - Right, Columbus! Right, I'm sorry.
there's no nameplate, so... Columbus, take the Neanderthals...
...and do a sweep from Invertebrates all the way through Reptiles.
jed and Octavius, their vars parked out back. Go take care of it.
whoa, whoa, whoa, no! No, sir. I ain't working with toga boy.
Romans work alone.
that didn't hurt. Don't be a baby. - Yes, it did.
come on.
that was much harder!
guys, come on!
Jed, Octavius.
take away the fact you were born 2000 years apart...
...you guys aren't that different.
you're both great leaders.
you just want what's best for your people, right?
Yeah. - Yeah.
civil War dudes.
you guys are brothers, for God's sakes. You gotta stop fighting.
north wins. Slavery's bad. Sorry.
don't wanna burst your bubble. But, South, you guys get Allman Brothers...
...and NASCAR, so just chill!
look, without that tablet, all of this...
...this whole coming-to-life-at-night thing, it all goes away.
now, I don't wanna let that happen, but I need your help.
we can get this done, but we gotta do it together.
so who's with me?
Yeah.
who's with me? - Yeah!
Yeah! - Charge!
all right! Now, let's do this, people!
and animals!
and weird, faceless puppet creatures. Come on, let's go! Let's do it!
come on! Follow me, boys!
Geronimo!
Oh, jeez.
now, boys, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
I guess it's gonna be the hard way.
right, men, we're almost there.
save yourself!
I ain't quitting you!
Gus?
Reginald?
fellas, where are you?
guys?
that's what I'm talking about. Good job, gentlemen.
loving the teamwork!
they've vanished. How will we find them?
I know someone who can help. Come on.
watch out!
Hey, Sakagawea, or wea. Listen, I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet.
you think you can track the guys who took it?
he went east but he lost control and crashed.
you're amazing. How can you tell that?
he left the wagon...
...and went back.
he went back?
why would he go back?
get out of the way!
you saved me.
you're won'th saving, my dear.
that's problematic. - Teddy. Oh, man.
Larry, relax. I'm wax.
you gotta do something. Dawrs approaching.
half the museum's running amuck outside. - He's got my tablet.
come on, Ockie!
at your service, Gigantor!
how can we be of assistance, my liege?
just give me a second, guys.
Rexy?
here, boy.
Teddy, I need a horse.
do it, man.
come on, boy! Let me hear you yell! - Yeah!
just living the dream, baby!
I'm loving this!
pull the stagecoach over now!
can I make this turn up here?
I'll take that as a yes. Hang on!
I can't hold it!
come on, Tex, let's finish this.
come on!
give me the tablet, Cecil!
can't do it, son.
pull over!
it ain't gonna happen. Moving on.
last chance, Cecil. Stop the horses or I will!
they can't be stopped, Larry.
don't you know your history?
these are money carriers. They were trained not to stop for anything but a secret word.
Really? You mean a word like...
..."Dakota"?
come on, Tex.
I read up on my history. Thanks for the tip.
Oh, and by the way...
...don't ever talk to me like that in front of my son.
moving on.
Hey, Huns. - Tell Attila to have his boys...
...Take him back. Put him with the guards.
Oh, and no limb ripping, okay?
Hey, boy. Wait, wait, hold the phone.
what's makeekaka mean? Wait. Translation, please.
the year was 1909. I was going up the Zambezi River in Africa.
and our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy who spoke only by clicking.
there we are.
Oh, boy. - What is it?
I gotta get you guys back to the museum.
how?
Ahkmenrah, I'm gonna need your help.
this is your tablet. You know the instructions. You get everyone back.
come on. There's somebody who's gotta see this.
what I'm saying is, for the type of money that they pay A-Rod...
...he ought to be bringing home a World Series trophy every season.
you know what I mean?
now, who they gonna get to clean up all that doo-doo?
inuit. - Yeah.
one terracotta soldier.
Vikings. - Right.
alpaca. - Welcome back, ladies.
llama. - Hey.
Viking guys.
do me a favor. Your fellows made some funeral pyre in Petrified Wood. Go clean that up.
okay? Thank you.
he's back. - All right, I'll deal with this joker.
Hey, hey, Moose. It's not gonna happen, buddy. All right?
I told you, you can't come through with those antlers.
so you and your caribou buddy gotta go around to the loading dock.
Lawrence! - Hey, Teddy.
great to see you in one piece.
Sakagawea, a little hot wax, and I'm a new man.
Larry?
I told you I wasrt making fun of you.
I know. - Teddy?
Oh, my God.
wanna meet her?
yeah? - Yeah.
okay, come on.
excuse me. President Roosevelt, this is my friend Rebecca.
an honor. - Hi.
and this is Sakagawea.
Wea. - Wea.
Wea.
I think she has a few questions she wants to ask you.
you rock. I am a big fan.
what would you like to know?
well, I mean, I don't know where to start, but...
one Buddha. - Check.
two zebras.
right. Check. - Dexter! Welcome back.
Hey, Dex, so look. No hard feelings, all right?
Lawrence! - You saw!
you saw what he did just then! - Who's evolved?
I am. - Who's evolved?
I am!
good.
well, they're all here.
well done. Everyone's in.
Yeah, well...
...not everyone.
we lost a couple of good, little men out there tonight.
with great victory comes great sacrifice.
Yeah.
dad, look.
it was nice of Larry not to rat us out, but this is ridiculous.
we're night watchmen, not janitors!
gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job.
I'll gonna catch a few Z's.
you ain't going nowhere.
start mopping, hot dog.
over here.
...that frequent the house.
I mean, undoubtedly, you're either Jim Barris or Ernie Luckman...
...Charles Freck...
...even Arctor himself.
hell, you could be Donna, for all I know.
as my superior, I figure you'd know all this stuff.
how the hell would I know?
I'm just a little guy behind a big desk.
you'd have to go way up the food chain to access that kind of info.
you know, instead of me doing any maintenance...
...send someone to the house once a month, in uniform...
...and have him say, "Good morning.
I'm here to service the monitoring devices...
...covertly installed on your premises.
maybe that sucker Arctor would even pick up the bill.
actually, I think Arctor would probably kill the guy and then disappear.
if it's proven that Arctor is, in fact, hiding that much.
believe me, Arctor is hiding a great deal.
we've got more recent information on him analyzed...
...and there's no doubt about it, he's a ringer.
a three-dollar bill. The guy is a phony.
so keep on him until he drops...
...until we have enough to arrest him and make it stick.
you think he's high up in the, you know, Substance D network?
what we think is of no importance to your work.
you report your limited conclusions, and we evaluate.
you got it? - Okay, okay.
I got it.
I'd say Arctor is doomed if he's up to something.
and I have a hunch, from what you're saying, that he is.
the idling jets could be replaced with smaller jets that would compensate.
and with a tach, he could just watch his rpms so it didn't over-rev.
usually just backing off on the gas pedal...
...causes it to upshift if the automatic linkage doesn't.
what are you grease monkeys up to?
Bob's got a bent choke shaft.
how much does this Impala weigh? - Weighs about 1000 pounds.
thousand pounds traveling at 80 miles per hour builds up a force of...
that's 1000 pounds with passengers in it and a full tank of gas.
for a fact? Okay. - How many passengers?
twelve. - Six in the front, six in the back.
no, that's 11 in the back and the driver sitting alone in the front.
extra weight on the rear wheels is to keep from fishtailing.
we talking about 1250-pound passengers?
kids' soccer team. - Now, is that metal or plastic cleats?
metal cleats for safety. - Okay, my computations are complete.
you are just heckle tweak, but you are bug-bite squared.
what kind of bug? - About-to-get-fucked-up-bitch beetle.
Hey, come on. Cool it, you guys. - Tell me...
step back. Freck-and-frack, Ernie's on the attack.
what is this? - Come on.
I'm desperately afraid. - I'm gonna knock your nads...
...up into your nostrils for talking to your betters that way.
all right. I'm a technician, you're an interloper.
you are constitutionally incapable of not shutting the fuck up.
bring it! - Shut the fuck up!
no, no, proctology boy, I'm coming after you.
shut it. Hey. Hey.
I have the perfect tool for this job.
I was only kidding him. - Fuck.
fuck!
what if he goes in there and he gets his gun and his silencer?
I'm leaving. This place has become unsafe.
no, hey, hey, Freck. No, come on. You're a bro, man. Stick around.
what's the hammer for, Barris?
no, I just saw it inside and thought I, you know, should bring it along with me.
same with this. - You ready?
Yeah, what do you want?
come on, hammerhead. - Shut up.
make a move. - Don't like it.
okay. If you guys are gonna kill each other, I'm splitting.
it's getting very fucked up over here. - Hey, Freck.
the most dangerous kind of person is the one who's afraid of his own shadow.
what is that supposed to mean? - I'll tell you.
it means that if you take too much of that stuff...
...you not only start seeing bugs all over...
...but you start talking like... and no one can understand you.
What'd you say, Barris? I didn't understand.
see, you guys are fucked up.
no, no, it is y-uck-uck-ou that are fuck-ucked-ed up.
don't take the car, you'll kill yourself.
so this guy's been going around claiming to be a world-famous impostor, right?
says he's posed, at one time or another, as a surgeon at John Hopkins...
...as a theoretical, submolecular, high-velocity...
...particle-research physicist on a federal grant at Harvard...
...as a Finnish novelist who won the Nobel Prize for literature...
...as a deposed Argentinean president...
...who was married to a go-go dancer from Chicago...
he got away with all that?
he never got caught? - Okay, you broke my flow...
...so now I guess I'll just have to segue down to the near.
that's just it. You see, he didn't pose as any of those.
he just posed as a world-famous impostor. Yeah.
it came out later in the L. A. Times.
they checked up, and he was pushing a broom at Disneyland or something.
he saw that old DiCaprio movie.
you know, the one where he plays a world-famous impostor...
...before Leonardo hit his Elvis stage.
and his first thought was:
Hey, I could pose as all those exotic guys and get away with it.
but then, his next thought was, "Hell, why bother?
I could just pose as an impostor, and it'd be a lot easier.
they say that he made more money than the actual impostor...
... although I'm not sure if they'd adjust for inflation.
well, you know, we all see impostors now and then...
... but not posing as subatomic physicists.
Oh, as a narc, you mean.
what's a narc look like?
that's like asking, "What's an impostor look like?"
I talked to this dealer who 'd been busted.
I asked him what the narc who busted him looked like.
what did he say, he looked just like us?
more so.
so I guess the moral of that is...
... stay away from guys looking the same as us.
well, there are female narcs.
Oh, hey, I'd like to meet one of those.
no, I don 't mean a female. I mean just the narc, knowingly, like, positive.
sure. So you could positively know. And you will.
when he slaps the cuffs on, you'll know for sure, when that day comes.
how could a guy do that?
pose as a narc?
what? - What?
pose as a narc?
no, you said it. So yeah. - Pose as a narc.
Oh, sh... Shit, I'm spaced.
pose as a narc, wow.
pose as a narc.
my brains are scrambled today.
Christ, Barris, what the fuck?
Yes, hi. How are you?
I have something somewhat emergent to report.
I don 't know if I should be summoning the inhalator squad...
... or the resuscitation squad.
Yes, ma 'am?
I don 't know. I don 't want to say it's not cardiac arrest...
... but it's either that or an involuntary asphyxiation of a bolus within the...
the address, yes. The address is simple...
... although I've never sent myself a piece of mail here.
seven... Seven... Seven-zero-niner. Street? Is the street relevant?
come on. - Tell you this much, it is a cul-de-sac.
does that technically qualify as a street?
I'm pleased to report we won 't be needing your assistance after all.
thank you. Have a nice day.
there you go. Took care of itself.
okay. - Oh, Jesus.
you all right? There you go.
I must've passed out.
Yeah. - Well, you... I was dreaming.
must have almost died. - Yeah.
shit.
and what were you doing while I was being escorted by dead relatives...
... to the bright light? Jacking off?
no, no, no. You saw me. I was on the phone.
I summoned the paramedics.
I sprung into action without delay. - Bullshit. You were cleaning your pipe.
I was wrapping my pipe. You were unconscious.
you the only person in the universe who never heard of the Heimlich maneuver?
all right, I'm gonna give you a little feedback...
... since you seem to be proceeding through life like a cat without whiskers...
... perpetually caught behind the refrigerator.
your life and watching you live it...
... is like a gag reel of ineffective bodily functions.
I swear to God that a toddler has a better understanding...
... of the intricacies of chew, swallow, digest...
... don 't kill yourself on your TV dinner.
and yet, you've managed to turn this near-death fuck-up of yours...
... into a moral referendum on me.
you are a monster! - Oh, fuck.
you are a billy goat. - A sick, depraved un...
Charles Freck, becoming progressively more and more depressed...
... by what was happening around him, decided finally to off himself.
there was no problem in the circles where he hung out...
... in putting an end to yourself.
you just bought a large quantity of downers...
... and took them with cheap wine.
the planning part had to do with the artifacts...
... he wanted found on him by later archeologists.
he had spent several days deciding...
... much longer than he had spent deciding to kill himself.
he would be found lying on his back on his bed...
... with a copy of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead...
... and an unfinished letter to Exxon...
... protesting the cancellation of his gas credit card.
that way, he would indict the system and achieve something by his death...
... over and above what the death itself achieved.
at the last moment, he changed his mind on a decisive issue...
... and decided to drink the pills with a connoisseur wine...
... instead of Ripple or Thunderbird.
so he set off on one last drive, over to Tiny's Liquors...
... which specialized in fine wines...
... and bought a bottle of 2001 Azalea Springs Merlot...
... which set him back almost $ 70.
back home again, he uncorked the wine, let it breathe, drank a few glasses of it...
... and tried to think of something meaningful, but could not.
and then, with a glass of merlot, gulped down all the pills at once.
however, he had been burned.
instead of quietly suffocating, Charles Freck began to hallucinate.
the next thing he knew, a creature from between dimensions...
... was standing beside his bed, looking down at him disapprovingly.
you're gonna read me my sins?
it's gonna take 100, 000 hours?
your sins will be read to you ceaselessly, in shifts, throughout eternity.
the list will never end.
the Sins of Freck.
Charles Freck wished he could take back the last half-hour of his life.
age 6, in the first grade: theft of fingernail clippers.
3: 08 p. m. Theft.
you did knowingly and with malice punch your baby sister, Evelyn.
kicking the dog.
december: theft of Christmas presents.
one million lies. Destruction of...
one thousand years later, they had reached the sixth grade...
... the year he had discovered masturbation.
november 14th: Percodan.
vicodin. Cocaine.
Charles Freck thought, "At least I got a good wine."
where did Substance D come from?
why can't we stop it?
the bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose...
...the more Substance D is on our streets.
can't you figure this out?
look around you. Look how far we've come.
humanity wasn't meant to live like this.
our every waking moment tracked and traced and scanned.
it's time to stop submitting to this tyranny.
it's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
it's our tax dollars at work. Protect us from ourselves.
Hey, guys, I used to be one of you.
stop selling out your own species.
Hey. Get in.
you scared me.
got something for you.
I'm seeing some crazy shit tonight.
what do you mean?
that fucking Barris.
you know how he works?
he doesn't kill anybody...
...but he hangs around until the situation arises where they die.
and then he just sits there.
and he sort of sets them up in the first place while he stays out of it.
but I'm not sure how.
Hey, do you have that money for the stuff? I need it tonight.
Yeah. I have it. - Okay.
you know, I don't like Barris.
and I don't trust him.
guy's fucking crazy.
and when you're around him, you start acting crazy.
and then when you're not around him, you're fine.
you're acting crazy now.
I am? - Yes.
Hey, will you take me to a concert next weekend at Anaheim Stadium?
sure.
yeah? - Yeah.
Yeah. Which night?
it's Sunday afternoon.
whatever you want.
well, I'll just drive over to my place.
you have the money, you'll give it to me.
we'll kick back, drop some Death...
...maybe get some tequila.
all right.
all right.
Hey, Donna, do you like cats?
drippy little things.
moving along about a foot above the ground.
above?
you mean, on the ground?
just dripping behind furniture.
little spring flowers with blue in them that come up first.
Yeah.
before the... - Before someone stomps on them...
...and they're all gone.
it's like you know me.
you can read me.
can I put my arms around you?
I wanna hug you, okay? - No.
what? - Look, I do a lot of coke, okay?
I just have to be really careful because I do a lot of coke.
so just leave my body alone, okay?
okay.
sure.
Yeah.
you know, fuck it.
Hey, l... I'm sorry.
I just don't like it when people grope my body...
...and I have to watch out for that because I snort so much coke.
that's fucking lame. I gotta go.
your car's not fixed.
I drove you here, I'll drive you back.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob, wait.
please.
please wait.
I didn't mean... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
I'm just... I'm so out of it right now.
l... Sometimes after I've worked really hard all day, l...
please, come back.
come on. With the tequila.
how much do you do?
not that much. And I don't shoot up.
I never have and I never will. l...
once you start shooting, you got like six months, maybe.
and even tap water.
you get a habit.
you have a habit.
we all do.
I mean, so what? What's the difference?
I'm happy.
aren't you happy? - Listen to me.
I think it's starting to get bad.
you know what I wanna do someday, Bob?
I wanna move north, live on a farm...
...near the mountains, in a cabin.
can I go with you?
I hope so.
I hope so.
all right. You weren't kidding.
do you have a toothbrush?
what?
well, screw it. Screw it.
teeth are teeth.
I'Il... I'll brush them.
know where the bathroom is?
what bathroom?
in the house.
who are those guys out there?
rolling joints and rattling on and on?
they live here with you?
two of them do.
so you're gay?
try not to be. That's why I called you tonight.
so you're putting up a pretty good battle against it.
you better believe it.
guess I'm about to find out.
if you're a latent gay, then you'll want me to take the initiative.
you want me to undress you?
sure.
Oh, Jesus, fuck.
Hello?
Fred, we've processed some more recent material on you.
how are you feeling?
okay.
any problems?
well, I had a fight with my girl.
any confusion?
are you experiencing any difficulty identifying persons or objects?
any language disorientation?
no.
can you come back over to room 203?
what did you find to be a problem?
we'll take that up when you get here.
Donna.
all right, Fred. Very good.
and this next test, with your eyes covered...
...reach out and feel an object with each hand.
you are to tell us if the object presented to your left hand...
...is identical to the object presented to your right.
one more thing, Fred.
we need an updated blood test.
so go down the hall to the pathology lab, and they'll fix you up.
and by the time you get back, we should almost be through with our evaluation.
I'll be upstairs with Hank.
you certainly seem much more depressed today...
...than you did when we first saw you.
pardon?
last week, when we first saw you, you were kidding and laughing.
did you ever get her the flowers?
crazy job they gave me.
but if I wasn 't doing it, someone else would be.
and they might get it wrong.
they might set Arctor up, plant drugs on him and collect a reward.
better it be me, despite the disadvantages.
just protecting everyone from Barris is justification in itself.
what the hell am I talking about?
I must be nuts.
I know Bob Arctor. He's a good person.
he's up to nothing. At least, nothing too bad.
in fact, he works for the Orange County Sheriff's Office covertly...
... which is probably why Barris is after him.
but that wouldn 't explain...
... why the Orange County Sheriff's Office is after him.
something big is definitely going down in this house.
this rundown, rubble-filled house...
... with its weed-patch yard...
... and cat box that never gets emptied.
what a waste of a truly good house.
so much could be done with it.
a family and children could live here.
it was designed for that.
such a waste.
they ought to confiscate it and put it to better use.
I'm supposed to act like they aren 't here.
assuming there's a "they" at all.
it may just be my imagination.
whatever it is that's watching...
... it's not human...
... unlike little dark-eyed Donna.
it doesn 't ever blink.
what does a scanner see?
into the head?
down into the heart?
does it see into me, into us?
clearly or darkly?
I hope it sees clearly, because I can 't any longer see into myself.
I see only murk.
I hope for everyone's sake the scanners do better.
because if the scanner sees only darkly, the way I do...
... then I'm cursed and cursed again.
and we'll only wind up dead this way...
... knowing very little and getting that little fragment wrong too.
you show what we regard...
...more as competition phenomenon than impairment.
yeah?
competition between the left and the right hemispheres of your brain.
it's like you have two signals that interfere with each other...
...By carrying conflicting information.
it's as if you have two fuel gauges on your car.
they're studying the same amount of fuel...
...but one says your tank is full, the other registers empty.
they can't both be right.
and you as the driver have only an indirect relationship to the fuel tank...
...via the gauges.
so, what does all this mean?
well, I'm sure you know already.
you've been experiencing it without knowing why or what it is.
two hemispheres of my brain...
...are competing?
Yes. - Yes.
but why?
substance D.
it often causes that, functionally, and this is what the tests confirm.
damage has taken place to the normally dominant left hemisphere...
...and the right hemisphere is attempting to compensate.
Crosscutting, we call it...
...related to split-brain phenomenon.
we could perform a right hemispherectomy...
...but I'd...
will this ever go away?
probably. It's a functional impairment.
it may be organic damage.
it may be permanent.
time will tell, and only after you've been off Substance D for a long while.
I'll never take Substance D again for the rest of my life.
how much are you taking now?
not much.
more, recently, because of job stress.
death is swallowed up in victory.
behold, I tell you the sacred secret now:
you shall not all sleep in death.
we'll do the other half of Southern California tomorrow night.
the Air Force arsenal at Vandenberg will be hit for automatic weapons...
what about that anthrax Anwar ripped off for us?
when do we...? Aren 't we supposed to carry the stuff to the watershed area...?
we need the weapons first.
drugs in the water supply is step B.
okay, but I gotta go. I got a customer.
I can also identify the aforementioned terrorist cell.
it's indicated throughout the course of my observations.
do you have any more material of this sort, or is this tape substantially it?
no, I have a veritable cornucopia...
...and much of it is directly referencing the organization and its directives.
who are these people? What organization?
it is primarily Arctor and Hawthorne.
I have coded notes here, which may be of some interest to you.
l... My own cryptology is very difficult to...
as of now I'm impounding all of this.
it is our property temporarily, and we will sort through it ourselves.
you will be on hand to explain anything to us...
...if and when we get to the point where we feel we need anything explained.
Mr. Barris, you will not be released pending our study of this material.
you will be charged, as a formality, to keep you available...
...with knowingly giving the authorities false information.
this, of course, is just a pretext for your own safety.
I always wanted to go to the Galapagos...
is that satisfactory, Mr. Barris? - Not entirely.
though I wonder, when I'm locked down...
...may I be provided with some lotion, and perhaps some...?
so, what do you think of Barris' evidence?
seems like what he played... The little we heard anyway.
sounded pretty genuine to me.
it's fake. Worthless.
made on a home computer.
maybe you're right.
is that my medical report you have there?
Yep.
what does it say?
that you're completely bonkers.
completely?
there's maybe two brain cells that still light up.
rest is just...
...short circuits and sparks.
two?
listen, when you go to pick up your next paycheck...
...there will be a substantial difference this time.
I get some sort of bonus for this...?
for this having happened to me on duty?
no. Read your penal code.
an officer who willingly becomes an addict and doesn't report it promptly...
...is subject to a misdemeanor charge...
...a fine, and/or six months.
you'll probably just be fined.
willingly?
no one held a gun to your head and shot you up.
no one dropped something in your soup.
you knowingly and willingly took an addictive drug...
...brain-destructive and disorienting.
I had to.
you could have pretended to.
most officers manage to cope with it.
and from the quantities you were taking...
my God, Fred, I...
Hey, you know what I would do if I were you?
once you get out of New Path and, you know, it's all over...
but it may never be over.
cigarette?
I'm getting off that too. Everything.
including chocolate. Yeah.
and...
like I tell my kids...
I've got two kids. Two girls.
little ones.
I don't believe you do.
you're not supposed to.
maybe not.
listen, is there anywhere specific you'd like to go?
maybe over to Donna Hawthorne's place?
from the information you brought in, sounds like you guys are pretty close.
Yes, we are.
how'd you know that?
process of elimination.
I know who you aren't...
...and we're talking about a very small group of people...
...that we hoped would lead us higher.
and maybe Barris will.
I pieced it together a long time ago that you're Arctor.
I'm who?
I'm Bob Arctor?
Yeah, get me Donna Hawthorne's number...
...or just patch me through when you locate her.
Thanks.
bud, you are in a very bad way, my friend.
maybe Jim Barris poisoned you.
we're really interested in Barris, not you.
the whole scanning of the house was to keep an eye on him.
we hoped to draw him here, and we did.
he is deep into it with some very dangerous people.
then I'm a what?
well, we had to get to Barris to set him up.
so how we arranged it was...
...he grew progressively more and more suspicious...
...that you were an undercover cop...
...trying to nail him or use him to get high or...
so he did what you or anyone would have done.
Hey, Donna.
Yeah, hi, this is a buddy of Bob's. Arctor.
Yeah.
listen, he's in a... He's in a bad way.
Yeah, way bad.
I was wondering if I could ask a favor of you.
you're a sweetheart.
Yeah, I'm sure he'll appreciate it very much.
great, thanks. Good news.
Donna Hawthorne said she'd pick you up out front in about five minutes.
you fuckers.
you're a good man, Bob.
you've been dealt a bad deal.
this is not fair, but it has to be this way.
you just...
you gotta... You gotta just wait it out, just get through it.
and someday...
...a long time from now...
...you'll see the way you saw before.
there'll be a recognition...
...and some spark in a disguised form...
...will reveal itself to you...
...and guide you.
substance D? - Yeah.
ate his head.
another loser.
it's easy to win.
anybody can win.
goodbye.
living and unliving things are exchanging properties.
the drive of unliving things is stronger than the drive of living things.
the living should never be used to serve the purposes of the dead.
but the dead should, if possible...
Hey, good news.
I think I got you transferred to one of our farms.
can I work with animals? - I think you'll be working with plants...
...for a while. In the open, where you can touch the ground.
I wanna be with something living. - The ground is living.
the earth is still alive.
do you have any agricultural background?
I worked in an office.
well, you'll be outside from now on.
your name is Bruce.
my name is Bruce.
we're gonna try you on farming for a period, Bruce.
okay. - Staff thought you'd be better off.
I think you'll like it here.
I think I'll like it here.
come on, I'll show you where you're gonna be sleeping.
you like mountains, Bruce?
look up.
mountains.
no snow, but mountains.
I like mountains.
the air is good here.
I like air.
Yeah.
we all like air, Bruce. We really do.
that we have in common.
4g.
yours is 4G. Can you remember that?
will I be seeing my friends?
what, you mean from back where you were?
the Santa Ana facility?
Mike and Laura...
...and Mike and Eddie. And...
the people from the residence facilities...
...they don't come out to the farms, Bruce.
see, these are closed operations. - Closed operations.
but, you know, you might get back up there...
...couple times a year.
you know, there are gatherings at Christmas...
...and the next one is Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving.
so you might see them in three months.
Hey, Audrey.
glad you could meet.
so tell me, are they getting paranoid about him?
no, not at all. The guy's so burnt-out.
and we're still convinced they're growing the stuff?
they have to be. Who else?
I just wonder if it even matters at this...
it matters, Audrey.
it matters when we can prove that New Path is the one growing...
...manufacturing and distributing.
how does he look?
I mean, do you think he's gonna be able to pull through for us?
all we can do is hope that when he finally gets in there...
...a few charred brain cells will flicker on and some distant instinct will kick in.
it's just...
it's just such a cost to pay. - Yeah.
but there's no other way to get in there.
I couldn't, and think how long I tried.
they got that place locked up tight.
they're only gonna let a burnt-out husk like Bruce in.
harmless. You have to be, or they won't take the risk.
Yeah, but to sacrifice someone...
...a living person, without them ever knowing it.
I mean, if he'd understood, if he had volunteered...
...but he doesn't know and he never did.
he didn't volunteer for this.
sure he did. It was his job.
it wasn't his job to get addicted.
we took care of that.
look, Mike, I gotta get out.
I can't do this again.
I want it to end. l...
I lay in bed at night, and I can't sleep, and I just think:
shit, we are colder than they are. - I don't think so.
I mean, I believe God's m. o. is to transmute evil into good...
...and if he's active here, he's doing that now...
...although our eyes can't perceive it.
the whole process is hidden beneath the surface of our reality...
...will only be revealed later.
and even then...
...the people of the future...
...our children's children will never truly know...
...this awful time that we have gone through and the losses we took.
well, maybe some footnote in a minor history book.
a brief mention with no list of the fallen.
you're seeing the flower of the future.
but not for you, Bruce. - Not for me.
no, you've had too much of a good thing already.
get up, get up. Stop worshipping.
this isn't your god anymore, although it once was.
gone.
flowers gone.
no, you just can't see them.
back to work.
I saw.
back to work, Bruce.
I saw death rising from the earth...
...from the ground itself...
...in one blue field.
a present for my friends...
...at Thanksgiving.
independence Inn. Michel speaking.
I fixed the peach sauce.
I wanna take a bath in that sauce. - I will make more.
let Michel look at your French paper before you go.
excuse me. - That'd be great.
what's going on? - Open it.
I'm gonna be in a Britney Spears video? - You're going to Chilton! Sorry.
I told Mom you're changing schools.
was she thrilled? - The party's on Friday.
I got the invoice for your enrollment fee.
you did it, babe. You got in.
wow, that is a lot of zeros behind that five.
Hi, Mom. - Lorelai. My goodness, this is a surprise.
so, you need money. - It's not for me. It's for Rory.
since we are now financially involved in your life...
I want to be actively involved in your life.
ms. Gilmore, I'm Headmaster Charleston.
mom, what are you doing here?
I came to wish my granddaughter luck on her first day of school.
she is my daughter. And I decide how we live, not you.
I'm allowed to pay for it but not set foot on the premises.
I just wanna get the rules straight. - Oh, boy.
so this whole plaid skirt thing, my idea? - My day sucked, too.
dinner was lovely, Emily. - Mira does make a perfect cassoulet.
who's Mira? - Our cook.
I thought the cook was Heidi. - No, we let Heidi go months ago.
she had a problem closing things. The door, the refrigerator...
the liquor bottle.
then it was Trina, then Sophia. - I liked Sophia.
you did not. - I didn't?
she was the one who sang. - That's right. Terrible woman.
and after Sophia, we had Anton.
that's right. Anton was the one that I liked.
I'm sorry. Dad, how do you mix up Anton and Sophia?
what do you mean? - One is a man and one is a woman.
and your point being... - That one is a man and one is a woman.
I have a lot to do in a day, Lorelai.
I don't have time to keep up with the multitudes of people that your mother employs.
but one is a man and one is a woman.
the dinner was so wonderful, Mira. - It's Sarah.
I'm sorry.
mom, her name is Sarah.
I thought she said Mira.
grandma, these plates are really pretty.
thank you, Rory. They were your great-grandmother's.
Lorelai I. - I thought mom was the first.
not in the name.
no, but in so many other things, I was a regular trailblazer.
just finishing your thought, Mom.
Lorelai I was my mother.
she was an extremely accomplished equestrian...
a distinguished patron of the arts...
and she was also world-famous for her masquerade balls.
she was quite a woman, my mother.
Yes, she was. Mira, come cut the cake, please.
Yes, and why don't you bring Sarah out here with you?
so, Lorelai, how are things at that charming little inn of yours?
they're still charming and little.
we're crossing our fingers it doesn't assert itself and become rude and large.
mom's having a huge wedding there this week.
Really? - Yeah.
there're people coming from all over the country.
isn't that nice? - Yeah.
Rory, how's Chilton? - Okay, done with me now.
I'm sorry, was there more to the story?
Rory has to pick a team sport to play. - It's a requirement.
physical fitness is as important as intellectual fitness.
so says Plato, and so say I. - What sport are you going to pick?
I'm not sure. I'm not really the athletic type.
I told her she should go out for the debating team.
that's not a sport. - It is, the way the Gilmores play.
so, what are your choices? - God, there are a thousand of them.
basketball, lacrosse, swimming, track, golf.
golf? - Yeah.
your grandfather is a golf player.
he plays every week at the club. He could teach you to play like a pro.
he could take you there on Sunday. It's perfect.
it's not something you can teach in an afternoon.
that's okay. Rory can pick something else.
why should she?
she needs to learn a sport, and Richard can teach her a sport.
you can use your mother's old golf clubs.
they're gathering dust along with the rest of her potential.
okay. Mom, could I maybe talk to you for a minute?
we're having dessert. - I know, but I'd like to talk to you fast...
before the sugar sets in and makes me crazy.
you are the oddest person. - Too easy.
what is so important that can't wait for cake?
keep moving.
this is as far as I can go, unless I bore my way through the wall.
don't do this, Mom. - Do what?
force Rory and Dad to go golfing. - I'm not forcing anybody.
you're manipulating the situation, giving no one a way out.
that's force. Look it up.
I'm trying to help your daughter get an education.
Thanks, she'll find another sport. - Why should she?
she doesn't wanna go, and Dad doesn't wanna take her.
he doesn't know what he wants. He'd cut his hair at the butcher's, if I let him.
just let it go, please.
well, isn't this interesting?
you're afraid. - Of what?
that Rory will enjoy the club and have a good time without you.
that's crazy. - I agree.
I'm not afraid. - Then let her go.
she won't enjoy it, Mom. - Why don't we just let Rory decide?
because she's the sweetest kid in the whole world.
she won't say she doesn't wanna go to avoid hurting your feelings.
I'm sure you could give her some coaching to get her over that.
I'm not trying to hurt your feelings. Believe it or not, this is not about you.
of course it's about me.
if Rory goes and has a good time without you, then I win.
okay, Bob Barker. Rory knocks herself out all week at Chilton.
the weekends are the only time she has to unwind and have fun.
with you. - I'm there.
so let me get this straight.
there's no way that Rory could possibly enjoy...
a weekend day with her grandfather.
you're just gonna twist it all around.
you know your daughter so well that you don't even have to ask her opinion.
she'd be miserable, and you'd know it.
I'm so setting myself up here. But, yes, she would be miserable.
that sounds a little controlling to me. - I walked right into that.
interesting, isn't it, you being the one who's controlling?
I am not being... - According to you...
I was the only one in the family with that gift.
I never said that!
I guess you and I are more alike than you thought, aren't we?
you win.
thank you.
did you get blind-sided? I'm so sorry. - That's okay.
I tried to stop it, I swear. - I know.
maybe it won't be that bad. - Maybe it won't.
maybe I'll like it. - Maybe you will.
maybe you could come with me. - Is there a "You're Crazy" team?
because they'd make you captain. - Please.
I love you. I would take a bullet for you.
but I'd rather stick a sharp thing in my ear than go to the club.
fine.
I'd rather slide down a banister of razorblades...
and land in a pool of alcohol than go to the club with you.
I got it. - Don't stop me, I'm on a roll.
I'd rather eat my own hand than go to the club with you.
I'd rather surgically alter my face to look like the mad rich lady with the lion head...
than go to the club with you.
would you like me to drive so you can continue your diatribe?
would you? Thanks. I'd rather cut off my head and use it as a punch bowl...
than go to the club with you.
you'll walk down here, over the bridge...
with the swans floating by and the music playing.
what are they doing with those purple flowers?
just decorating the bridge.
I didn't want purple flowers. I wanted pink.
and I wanted blue.
so I thought violet would be a nice compromise.
but we paid for pink flowers. - And the blue flowers.
you did not pay for anything. I told her to decorate with violet flowers.
it's nice of her to try to take the heat for me, but it's unnecessary.
if you don't like it, buy your own flowers.
Yes. I thought so.
now, go away. My Advil is wearing off.
their father spoiled them. - They're just excited.
they're spoiled.
and they won't move away.
now, disaster list. What if it rains? - We'll put up tents.
what if it's too windy? - We'll secure everything...
and put extra hairspray in everybody's hair.
too hot?
umbrellas and fans that won't cause any damage...
because of the things that have been secured and hair that's been sprayed.
so I have nothing to worry about? - No.
there must be something. - Listen, I have everything under control.
go to your room and have a fabulous bubble bath.
I'll send up some wine...
and a masseuse who bears a remarkable resemblance to Antonio Banderas.
how remarkable? - Get ready to applaud.
this is my favorite place in the whole world.
could you send Maury up to Room 12 in about 20 minutes? Thanks.
so, any problems? - With the wedding or my life?
one guess. And I'll give you a hint: it's not your life.
do you stage these events to torture me? - Yes.
job well done. - Okay, let's start again. Any problems?
guests are checked in, baskets are given out...
and 200, 000 tons of Jordan almonds have been delivered.
okay, good. Did Rory call? - No.
she's golfing all day with my father, and I'm half-expecting...
this big, "Save me!" call to come in. You don't care at all, do you?
to me, you are the teacher in the Charlie Brown cartoon.
forget it. Have the grooms arrived?
their plane was due at 7: 30. They should be here.
maybe they made a run for it. - Somebody got stood up at prom.
Oh, dear. - What?
are those... - No, it would be too...
...weird.
you kept this from me on purpose.
it's like a really snooty Doublemint commercial.
just let me know when the midgets and clowns arrive.
no.
you have to get them all settled in.
I'm not talking to them. - Yes, you are.
I'm not talking to them nicely.
it's after 8: 00. She should be here already.
she'll be here.
you're supposed to tee off at your designated time.
you pay good money to that place. You'll tee off when you tee off.
is that what you're wearing? - Yes.
what's wrong with what I'm wearing? - Nothing. It's fine.
this whole thing is absurd. - She's your granddaughter.
she's a 16-year-old who would rather be at the mall.
show her all around the club, especially the rose garden.
I am not a guide. - Make sure you take her to lunch...
and have her get dessert. - No one said anything about lunch.
I hope Lorelai's clubs are still in good shape.
Emily, you are not listening to me.
I will teach her to golf, as promised by you...
but lunch is out of the question.
you have to eat, so you'll eat together. Do you have sunscreen?
she's here. - 8: 30.
we must remember to buy her a watch.
Richard, so help me God, you will be sweet to this girl...
and make this a memorable day for her.
it's the first time we can show our granddaughter off at the club.
and it means a great deal to my happiness and yours that this day goes well.
are we clear?
Rory, hello! - Sorry, I'm late.
nonsense, you're right on time.
Hi, Grandpa. - Nice to see you.
this is a perfect day for golfing, isn't it? - It's cooler at 8: 00.
am I dressed okay?
I didn't have any of those short pant things.
actually, there is something missing. Wait a minute.
here we go.
now you look just like Tiger Woods. - That's some hat.
okay, off you go, you two.
have a wonderful time. - We will.
you bet.
is it hard to become a member here?
everyone has to go through a thorough screening process.
kind of like the FBI? - We're much more thorough than that.
Wow. - Yes.
do you know the merger of Farscape and DSS...
happened right here on this lawn? - Really?
international finance will never be the same...
and all because of a lost golfing bet.
that's crazy. - That's high finance.
here we are.
what do you know about golf?
that it's a good walk spoiled.
your driver is the most powerful club in your bag...
and as such, it can be your most valuable asset...
or your greatest liability.
to wield it properly requires a precise combination...
of confidence and humility.
confidence and humility. Got it. - There you are.
that's a pretty good natural grip.
now line the toe of your left foot up with the ball.
that's right. Drop this shoulder a little bit.
now, keeping your left arm firm, draw the club back...
and swing it cleanly through the ball.
I'm betting that was wrong.
there are no rights and wrongs to the learning process.
try that again.
I'm betting that was wrong.
these are blueberries. I ordered strawberries.
I know... - I did. I wrote it down, I got a copy.
Sookie, listen. - Yeah. "Mushrooms, melon...
endive, peaches, kiwi. - Excuse me, crazy lady.
I should make some kiwi ice cream.
Sookie! Listen. - What?
I know you ordered strawberries, but they weren't any good.
instead of selling you substandard strawberries...
I brought you blueberries.
I must make strawberry shortcake for 200 people...
so I think I'll need strawberries.
use the blueberries. - To make what?
blueberry shortcake. - There's no such thing.
the world was flat until someone took a boat trip.
can I see these strawberries? - No.
just one? - No.
how about a Polaroid?
coffee.
Sookie, can I take some of this cake home to Rory?
she's gonna need a special treat tonight.
she's spending the entire day with my father, golfing at the club.
no.
take the blueberries! - No!
the whole thing was masterminded by my mother.
one minute we're having an excruciating family dinner...
and the next minute she's manipulated my kid to spend her Sunday...
with my father at the country club.
I can't talk about it anymore. It's making me too upset.
tell me something happy. - I can't make the strawberry shortcake.
you suck at this game.
the battle for soup versus salad is raging in the other room.
come quick and settle it, please.
I'm running out of French curse words that they won't understand.
soup it's gonna be. - You always have a salad before a traditional meal.
why are you making a scene?
it's my party. - Just 'cause...
it's been 45 minutes of "soup or salad."
I can't do it anymore. Get me a cab.
I'm going to go far away now, and never come back.
how about if the guests get a choice of soup or salad?
that will work.
choice of soup or salad. - Got it.
it's so weird. - Which one is which?
I think the one on the right is Matt.
no, that's the one on the left. The one on the right is Mark.
that's very impressive. - I'm very good at observing people...
learning their tics and traits, the sound of their voices. It's a gift.
that one has a Post-it on its back. - Then that's Mark.
the one on the right is Matt.
take that off of him. - I will not.
we can't all call everyone "sweetie" and get away with it.
go with me here, but let's say Mark walks into a hotel room...
and he sees his wife naked, but it's not his wife...
it's his naked sister-in-law, and he has sex with her.
would that be cheating? - My head hurts.
I think no. - Really? Lucky.
if you ask me, this union belongs on a public access station.
it's against the laws of nature, and just this short of completely obscene.
you won't be giving the wedding toast.
how did everything work out? - Do you have children?
a daughter. - Do you hate her?
no. - Not ever?
I wasn't wildly fond of her during labor.
that was the high point for me.
I can't believe I hit the ball. - It's quite impressive.
it landed in the water. - Yes, but the splash was quite impressive.
this place is so beautiful.
I could see just coming here to think or read...
but that defeats the purpose of the holes with the flags in them.
there is something rather serene about walking around here.
do you come here every week? - No. When I can.
I'm often working on the weekends.
bummer. - Isn't it?
Hi, Richard.
can I ask you a question? - Go ahead.
what do you do? - I'm the Executive Vice President...
of the Gehrman-Driscoll Insurance Corporation.
Wow. - Yes.
and as Executive Vice President, what do you do?
it's a very big company, one of the largest in the United States.
I have a myriad of duties...
which would bore you greatly to hear about.
okay.
I oversee our international division. - That sounds important.
it rates a parking spot.
do you get to travel a lot? - Quite a bit.
lucky.
I suspect you have a yen for travel. - I'm up to my ears in yens.
any particular place you'd like to go? - Hundreds of places:
Paris, Rome, London, Prague, Istanbul, Fez.
have you ever been to Fez? - I can't say that I have.
I wanna go to Fez.
I think traveling, for a young girl, is a very important thing.
your mother never got a chance to travel much.
I know. She talks about that all the time. - She does?
we've got a deal. When I graduate from high school...
we're gonna go backpacking through Europe together.
you know, do the whole hostel thing.
I just hope it really happens. - We'll just have to make sure that it does.
you look wonderful. - Aren't you sweet? Is Emily here?
no, I'm taking my granddaughter for a round of golf.
we must get together. - Absolutely.
the most odious woman alive.
we'll meet back here in 40 minutes? - Okay.
and then, if you like, we can get some lunch.
that would be great. - Fine.
cool. - Yes.
and I'm telling him, "I've been coming here...
for 20 years, my young friend, and for 20 years, that cart...
number 43, has been my golf cart."
he should have known that. - Everybody knows it.
did he give you the cart? - Damn right he gave me the cart.
you should have never had to ask, because he should have known that.
Hello, gentlemen. - Richard, good to see you.
I heard about your golf cart. Too bad. - I'm still angry about it.
who was that young lady I saw you on the golf course with?
that is my granddaughter. - Really? She's lovely.
Lorelai's girl.
you're lucky. My granddaughter looks like she just fell off a potato truck.
my granddaughter would never be caught here.
it might get in the way of her time spent at the tattoo parlor...
or getting something pierced, or doing whatever she does...
while she runs wild through the streets like a rabid dog.
cut her off. That'll get her attention. - I can help you with the litigation.
actually, Rory just started Chilton.
Really? - Damn fine school.
she said she wanted to learn golf. I think she's taken to it quite well.
Yeah, just as long as she's not taken with a certain golf cart.
I'm writing a letter to the board. - I wish you would.
listen to me.
she took the house and I'm against it.
she deserved it, putting up with that tramp all those years.
last Christmas, he bought them both the same bracelet.
she should have shot him like his first wife did.
I love Janie. Is she out yet?
Gloria, hi. Good game?
not bad. You? - I just came for the steam.
we must get together and play sometime soon.
next week? - I'll call you.
the most odious woman alive.
okay, I need more tulle here. I need the feeling of a major tutu, okay?
Gary, the ribbons go on the chairs, not on the trees.
Oh, great.
where do you want the swans?
do you know where the pond is? - Nope.
you know that little road you came up? - Nope.
do you know how to say "big help" in Chinese?
Nope. - Michel!
this is 20 swans?
sure. Why not?
you screeched?
I need you to show him where to put the swans.
absolutely not.
I can't leave. I've got a major tulle festival going on out here.
I will never go near those filthy birds. - Why?
I hate the swans. - These particular swans?
no, all swans.
I was attacked by a band of swans in the Luxembourg Gardens...
when I was a boy. No one forgets that.
Oh, no, not being attacked by a band of swans.
was it an all-boy band? Kind of a scary, feathery, 'N Sync fiasco?
this is not funny. - No, I'm sorry. It's not funny at all.
Oh, my God.
come on, you have to admit that's a little funny.
Hey, you want to give me a hand with this?
no.
listen, it's Drella or the swans.
so either one beast of terror or another?
what is he babbling about? - Don't...
he's afraid of the swans. - Thank you.
of course he is. He's French.
okay, I'll take you to the pond. - Thank you.
but stay far away from me.
can't stand the talk. Love to watch the walk.
she caught him in the pool house with the tennis pro...
not the riding instructor.
I had no idea.
that committee of yours is not looking at people as much as you think.
why would they? From what you've told me...
they're all involved in one nefarious activity after another.
it's a conspiracy. - It's Peyton Place.
is there more? - Can you handle it?
I'll steel myself.
okay, Mr. Neville likes all things frilly.
good God, he's my broker.
I don't think one will affect the other.
mind if we barge in? - Look who's here.
Rory, this is Julian Johnson and Edward James.
call me Ed. - You can call me Ed, too.
it's nice to meet you. - Would you care to join us?
if Rory doesn't mind us intruding on her time with her grandfather.
no, that's fine. - Great.
so, we hear you're attending Chilton. - I just started.
that's a hard school. - Yes, sir.
Rory is an excellent student. - Really?
4. 0 grade point average.
that's got me beat.
she's going to Fez someday.
fez? What the hell is in Fez?
that's for her to find out.
interesting hat.
I went golfing with my grandfather today.
did you know golf courses are an environmental blight...
because of the chemicals used to keep the grass green?
actually, I did.
bad joke. Sorry.
my God. This day, the swans, the tulle, my head.
I need the largest cheeseburger in the world.
let's break a record, mister.
so, the wedding is a nightmare. We got these 10 boxes of creepy larvae...
that are supposed to swarm into butterflies on the wedding day.
they swarmed a little early. What's with the hat?
grandma gave it to me.
that's just mean. - It's not that bad.
do you want a mirror? - I'm taking it off.
so, Rory's golfing adventure. Tell me. - It was fine.
I brought you some of Sookie's chocolate cake to make you feel better.
it really wasn't that bad.
you're the sweetest kid in the whole world.
where on earth did you get that from?
Luke, am I mistaken, or did the sign on the door say "open"?
so where were we? - Me golfing.
right. Go. - Okay.
by the end of the day I could even hit the ball.
sometimes it wasn't my ball, but the intentions were good.
good intentions and no physical exertion whatsoever...
is what the game of golf was built on.
so did you order?
I'm not hungry. I had a big lunch at the club.
with all the other devastators of our land.
Luke, I'm really sorry. I didn't know.
you had a big lunch at the club? - Yeah, it was quite good.
quite? What's with the "quite"? - What do you mean?
you don't ever say "quite."
I've said "quite" plenty of times. - Whatever.
besides the "quite good" lunch you had, what else happened?
nothing. We played. I met his friends. I took a steam.
you took a steam? - Yeah.
I sweated out all my toxins, and I stole a towel.
sounds like you really had a good time. - I did.
Really?
okay, new word now. - Sorry. I'm just surprised.
I thought you were gonna be bored. - I was kind of surprised, too.
I don't know, it was pretty there. And Grandpa and I talked a lot.
you talked? Really? - You're doing it again.
sorry. You talked?
we talked about Fez. - And he thought it was a hat.
I told him about our backpacking trip, and he thought it was a great idea.
so you really had fun?
that's great.
that is really, really great.
I thought you were starving. - Things change. Move on.
does this hat really look bad on me?
no, I think it looks kind of cute.
it's your wedding day. Feel each other.
use the thumping of your heart as a metronome.
let passion be your choreographer.
be as light on your toes as you are in your hearts.
Oh, no, darling. Let me show you how it's done.
again?
you know, in some countries, if you dance this close...
you're cheating on your wife.
you're next. - Take your time.
my God, you've good handwriting. - Thank you.
you did not get that from me. Your fabulous flair you got from me.
I also got my deviated septum from you. - Hey, focus on the flair.
it's for you. He says he's your father...
although why he'd volunteer that freely, I don't know.
my father? - Yes.
are you sure? - Please just take the phone. Thank you.
dad?
Yeah, it's Lorelai. Who else calls you "dad"?
Yeah, she's right here. Hold on. It's for you.
Thanks. Hello?
Hey, Grandpa. That's great.
Jackie wants Samuel Barber, John Cage, and Philip Glass...
and Jessica wants Shania Twain's I Feel Like a Woman.
I'm not a jukebox. - Oh, please.
you think I started playing the harp...
cause I thought it would make me cool? Finally get me in with the in-crowd?
maybe I'd make for some great happy-hour conversation.
no, all right? The music drives me, lady.
I will play what I feel, and you will love it.
I'll give you an extra $100. - You just got yourself a jukebox.
Yeah, I'd love to see it.
no, if you want to.
sure. That sounds good. Yeah.
should I leave you two alone?
I think I want to change my hair. - Really?
I think it looks quite good. - You're funny.
do you want something to drink? - Yeah, water.
so, you talked to Grandpa today? - What?
grandpa, he called? - Yeah.
anything wrong?
no, he just found this book we were talking about.
and he just called to tell you? - Yeah. Why?
nothing. It's just weird. He doesn't call the inn that much.
or ever, actually.
he knew that I was looking for it, so... - Oh, sure.
what book is it? - Mencken's Chrestomathy.
Oh, that one. - Yeah.
cinnamon is stuck under our front porch again.
can I borrow some vegetable oil and a shoehorn?
I'll get it. - I'm calling him and calling him...
and I go around the porch...
and this big orange tush is just staring me in the face.
I hate when that happens.
Yeah. He must have been meowing for an hour...
but Morey was playing some Thelonious on the Steinway...
and when Morey plays, I go into this trance...
where all I can see is blue, and moon, and stars.
never mind, sugar. Play me home, baby!
Bye.
Oh, God! It's killing me!
Babbette didn't take her oil. - Keep it.
Christmas is early this year.
you know what I was thinking?
that Madonna and Sean Penn should get remarried?
besides that.
I was thinking your golfing expedition should totally count as a dinner.
what do you mean? - I can get us out of dinner...
at the grandparents' on Friday. Maybe we could grab a movie.
that's okay. - It's no big deal, really.
no. It's just gonna get Grandma all freaked out.
I can handle those freak-outs. I've done that.
I have to get the book from Grandpa anyway. Let's just go.
all right, if you really want to. - I do.
okay, fine.
is that my sweater? - What?
you're wearing my sweater. - So?
no, it's okay. It's just...
I thought I asked you to at least ask before you borrow my stuff.
I'm sorry. - It's okay.
it's not too much for a simple "Can I borrow it, Mom?" is it?
no, it's not. Jeez, lighten up.
it's my favorite sweater, too.
since when? - Since always.
this is not your favorite sweater. - Yes, it is.
now it's gonna be stretched out, like everything you borrow.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about that you take my sweaters...
wear them, and stretch them out.
I couldn't possibly stretch them out. Your boobs are way bigger than mine.
that is not true. - Yes, it is.
your boobs are totally bigger than mine. - You're crazy!
do you want to measure? - What?
I'm serious. Why don't you go get the measuring tape now?
I am not going to measure my boobs.
because you know that you are totally bigger.
I'm going inside. - Fine.
don't measure. We'll just compare bras. - Stop it.
I'll stop it when you quit stealing my stuff!
you're cracked!
you're bigger!
your boobs are bigger than mine? I'm a mental case.
so apologize.
I was too mad and stupid to apologize last night...
and she was gone before I got up this morning.
what is wrong with me? - You're very possessive of your sweaters.
I understand. If somebody breathes too hard on my paring knife...
I'm like a crazy spider monkey.
it's not about the sweater.
it's about the golfing thing and the liking-it thing.
she had fun, Sookie, just like my mother said she would.
Yeah, that's gotta hurt. - She should have fun.
I want her to have a good relationship with her grandparents.
just because I don't doesn't mean she shouldn't, right?
so then, why was I trying to get her out of Friday night dinner?
am I trying to undermine their relationship?
you weren't. - I was.
Yes, you were. - Yes, I'm 4 years old.
you're jealous. - I'm not jealous.
you are. You're jealous 'cause they like Rory better than you.
thank you for the hug.
see, I'm bad at advice talks.
can we talk about soup? Because I'm good with soup.
I'm sorry. You're fine. I'm all mixed-up.
I left that life: the club, my parents.
I ran from it as soon as I could.
it just never occurred to me that she might want it.
it occurred to my mother though. God, I hate that she was right.
you don't know that... Oh, my God.
Hey, watch it!
are you okay?
look at you. You're beautiful!
I have to be more adult about this.
I mean, if the country club life is what she wants...
more power to her, right?
you know, little white gloves and coming-out parties.
that makes some girls happy, right? - Sure, yeah.
if they're on Prozac, absolutely.
I just never thought that I raised that kind of kid, you know?
not that there's anything wrong with kids like that.
I didn't think that was Rory. Maybe it's not. I don't know.
am I obsessing? Sookie? Hello?
should I wear my strawberry costume to get your attention?
no, I'm sorry.
you have a strawberry costume?
unbelievable! - Jackson.
so this is what we've come to?
you sneaking around behind my back buying somebody else's strawberries?
I was desperate! - You disgust me!
I needed the strawberries. - Well, now you have them.
I hope you're happy together.
Jackson, wait! - No!
come on, Jackson! - No!
Jackson, we can talk about it. - No!
get back here! - Get away from me!
why are you following me?
don't you follow me. - Come on!
pardon me. There you are.
we did it. We sure did.
God, I feel wonderful!
I'm so glad it turned out the way you wanted it to.
you have no idea.
they just told me they're going to share a condo in Tucson, Arizona.
that's hundreds of miles away.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
sister Sledge! Excuse me.
Hey, stranger. - Hey.
good turnout? - Yeah.
want something to drink? - Are you trying to make up?
no, I'm trying to hydrate you. - I'm fine, thanks.
I'm sorry. - It's okay.
a crazy, evil spirit obsessed with bra size took over my body.
it happens. - She's gone now.
good to know.
I'm glad you're bonding with your grandparents.
no, you're not. - Yes, I am.
it's just weird for me, is all. I just can't relate to it.
you could if you tried. - No. We're too...
too much has happened.
I'm glad you are, anyway.
I didn't mean to cut you off from them so completely, you know.
it just happened.
not having them in my life just felt so right.
I just never thought...
I'm sorry.
I did not pay $500 for this dress...
so you could run around and mess it up. Now you sit and be still.
cross your legs. You're a lady.
God, I must have had a million dresses like that when I was a kid.
it doesn't really scream "you." - No.
I did all the screaming.
thank you for not putting me in a dress like that.
you're welcome.
of course, wearing those dresses... not all bad.
Oh, no. They really fly up when you twirl around.
and if you're wearing that ruffled underwear, big crowd pleaser.
if it makes you feel better, I think I got a fungus from the steam room.
it does. Thank you.
Oh, good. You're here.
Hi, Grandma.
my goodness. What's that? - We brought dessert.
Really? How thoughtful! What is it? - Blueberry shortcake.
I've never heard of blueberry shortcake. - It's a Stars Hollow specialty.
why is it already cut? - It's left over.
from the wedding.
at the inn.
I know where the wedding was.
sorry. You were just doing that staring thing.
you brought us used dessert? - It's not used. It's left over.
how nice.
I'll just put it in the kitchen next to my half-empty box of cheer.
she's in a good mood tonight.
can I get you a drink?
white wine would be great. - Coke.
did Rory tell you all about the wonderful time she had at the club?
she sure did. - Your father was simply flying all week.
she really charmed him. - If anybody could, it would be her.
in this age of MTV and 100 television channels...
who would have thought a girl could still get a thrill...
spending a simple afternoon with her grandfather?
that wine would be real good right now.
I think we should consider getting her a membership at the club.
if she wants, sure.
to have a place to go where she can socialize.
that's very important to a young girl.
now especially that the crack den has closed down on the corner...
all her really good friends are gone.
what do you think, should I pursue the career in comedy?
it's just very interesting the way things turn out, isn't it?
Oh, you're here.
Lorelai. - Dad.
Rory, I have a surprise.
not only did I find that copy of Mencken's Chrestomathy we discussed...
I also found a first edition of his memoirs as well.
my God, I'm going to Chilton? - You did it, babe. You got in.
this guy asked about you today.
I'm Dean. - Hi.
what did he want to know? - Where you were.
what did you say? - You had to go to the genius school.
I've been watching you.
when?
every day.
I'm Max Medina. - Nice to meet you.
I'm gonna miss the test!
go! - I'm gone!
what about the test? - You've missed the test.
I'm ready for it.
I know everything about Shakespeare.
I think there's been a terrible mistake.
Rory told me that she wasn't allowed to take her test.
she was late.
you say she's smart and she'll do fine.
and this rotting, stodgy rat hole could use somebody like her.
then you shut her out of a test that she's crammed for that she completely deserves to take!
no. Harvard is my dream.
I want it more than anything. I swear.
I'm not ready to give up on Chilton yet.
it's Max Medina calling.
Lorelai, it was a pleasure encountering you.
I hope it happens again.
where did you say Dad was?
away on business. - Location's top-secret?
germany.
is Dad's firm insuring Nazis? - Your father doesn't know any Nazis.
I know, Mom. I was just... - What?
joking. She was joking.
hard to tell. - Yeah.
I'm afraid I have some bad news. Claudia died.
who? - Claudia, your cousin.
I'm hearing the name, Mom. I have no idea who that is.
Claudia's your cousin, for all intents and purposes.
now we're getting to it.
she was your father's grandmother's sister's girl.
so, to you, that would make her... - nothing?
regardless. Funeral's on Thursday. I thought we'd all go together.
two problems: One, impossible to get away from the Inn on Thursday.
two, I've never met this woman.
you certainly have. - When?
several times. - I'll take one.
we went to her house in Groton to see the first moon landing.
she'd just gotten a new Philco.
I have no memory of this whatsoever.
Rory, correct me if I'm wrong, but men have walked on the moon...
regardless of whether your mother remembers.
that's the rumor.
I know men have walked on the moon. I just don't know Claudia.
so you're not going? - Not this time.
I don't think Claudia's planning to die a second time.
mom, I couldn't go if I wanted to. - Fine.
wait, Rudolph Gottfried.
another cousin?
no, a Nazi that we knew. I'd forgotten. We stayed with him once in Munich.
nice old man. Interesting stories.
mom, you socialized with a known Nazi?
that's despicable. That's heinous.
no, dear, that was a joke.
I have an idea for a new reality show.
how about everyone just looks out their kitchen window for a change?
she's cranky this morning.
let's just say the world's got a formidable opponent.
wait. Shouldn't you be baking? - I don't know. Shouldn't you be knitting?
mom, the Chilton bake sale is today. - I know. I got it covered.
they expect things to be homemade... - I know.
...By someone other than Dolly Madison.
I said I have it covered.
all of the parents pitch in, so this is really important. You know that, right?
I didn't know that. In that case, I don't have it covered.
I have it covered.
get your stuff, hit the stereo. We're late. - That's not me.
where does your mom think you are?
on a park bench, contemplating the reunification of the two Koreas.
not here, skanking to Rancid?
wouldn't be included. - School.
wow, Cinnamon, riding in style.
Yeah, Morey made it.
Cinnamon's not walking good these days, but she still likes her passeggiatas.
that's Italian for "a nice walk." - Passeggiata.
Oh, God, he makes it sound so sexy. - Come on.
what's that?
that's Cinnamon's private area. Sometimes she likes to be alone.
she's just like Morey in that sense.
say "passeggiata" again.
I can't do it on command, Baby.
he's blushing. God, I love a man that blushes.
okay, our town is just weird. - Thank God.
I'll see you later at school. - For what?
mom, the bake sale.
I got the vein in the forehead. - Sadist.
morning. - Good book?
I don't know yet.
I saw you standing in line, so I thought I'd say hello.
Hello? - Hello.
thanks for helping me get the job at the store.
it's not a career or anything, but it's got me solvent.
solvent is good. - Yeah.
are you always this serious? - No.
so, how long does it take you to get to school?
forty minutes if the bus driver's focused...
but longer if he's trying to win something on the radio.
this bus is going to Hartford. - Yeah, I know.
but you go to school here. You have to get off the bus.
he has to get off the bus. - Wait.
you're forgetting something.
buses make stops.
goodbye, Lorelai Gilmore.
independence Inn, Michel speaking.
Yes, you are confirmed.
goodbye.
no, sorry.
sir, I'm a simple country boy from Texas.
I do not understand this French business you're babbling about.
pardon.
he knows you are not from Texas. - Smile when you say that.
Michel, I told you there would be a French group here for some days...
and it's your job to keep them happy.
I don't know how many French people you've met over the years...
but most of them are insufferable. - Really?
that is why I left France.
I thought it had something to do with the torches and the villagers.
Michel, talk to them. - Never.
you are giving me that look, aren't you?
your patented "do it or something unspeakable shall befall you" look.
fine. I shall be French, but I shall not be happy.
then you will be yourself. Good choice.
kill me now.
okay, we've got our French fantasies...
american treats, and our Italian taste sensations.
what do you think? - Amazing.
incredible.
it is good, isn't it? Well, final touch.
can I do that?
honey, this is a more delicate procedure than you might think.
okay. - It takes an expert hand.
Hi.
what is that, $1? Let me just give you...
let me find you $1.
you know what? I'll take two. I'll drink one.
tasty and flame-retardant.
very Henry Vlll. - We're not into subtle.
good to see you, Lorelai. - Good to see you, Mr. Medina.
Max. - Mr. Medina.
Mr. Medina, meet Sookie, the chef at the Inn.
Sookie, Mr. Medina. - What's the name again?
Mr. Medina. - I know, you've said it a zillion times.
hello.
Lorelai, can I borrow you for a second?
Yeah, sure.
I'll be right back.
trust me.
so?
you know, Lorelai, I would love for the ice to thaw.
there's no ice. - You repeated my full name four times.
that's ice. - That's not ice. It's wintry.
I was doing my job when I didn't let Rory take that test.
I didn't like it, but I had to do it. - I know.
and I'd do it again. - Okay.
I really do think Rory's a great kid...
and I'll do my damnedest to make sure she gets through Chilton in one piece.
I appreciate that.
and I'd like us to be friends. - We are. Me, too.
yeah? - Really, truly, I swear. There's no more ice.
we're walking in a pool of tepid water.
good.
I'm going to propose something here. I'm not sure how you're gonna take it.
wow, intrigue.
I'd like to see you sometime.
away from the ivy, away from the gargoyles, away from here.
are you asking me out on a date? - Yes.
well, I don't want to go out on a limb here,
but if the headmaster won't let a kid be 30 seconds late for a test,
he'd probably frown on a teacher dating a mom.
I do my job well, I'm dedicated to my students...
and there's nothing in the Chilton Book of Ethics that prohibits it.
but I'm guessing it's sort of an unwritten rule.
do you want to go? - Rory would probably freak at the thought.
other parents would have a field day with this thing.
do you want to go? - Yes.
good. - Wait.
what? - No.
Why? - I can't.
it's wrong. It's weird. - I'll pay.
you're on. - Really?
I'm kidding. I don't know. You're Rory's teacher.
I know.
could you quit? Right, that's crazy. I'm sorry.
okay.
how about coffee? You like coffee?
only with my oxygen.
can we drink some together? A sort of pre-date.
very casual, no strings, no obligations.
we'll see if it's worth going down the road of including food in the deal.
just coffee.
decaf?
there's nothing safer than decaf.
I'm gonna be in town tomorrow because I take a class at Hartford State...
and there's a coffee shop across the street...
that I sometimes, almost all the time, go to around 4: 00...
and usually exactly 4: 12.
I could not stop a person from entering said establishment around that time,
nor would I avoid them,
if I knew them, if they did.
you know, the wordsmith thing, that's something we have in common.
so, see you around, Max.
indeed. You will.
Philadelphia.
Philadelphia? If you could live in any city in the world...
you'd pick Philadelphia?
M. Night Shyamalan lives there. - Who?
the guy who directed The Sixth Sense.
but what would you do there?
hang out with M. Night Shyamalan.
okay, cross "Guidance Counselor" off your list of potential career choices.
lie still, baby doll. We're almost home.
Hey, Babette. - Hey, kids.
wow, that sounds bad.
Cinnamon's dyspeptic. So is Morey.
too many clams. - Bad clams.
this doesn't reflect well on Al's establishment.
you had clams at Al's? - Al's Pancake World?
Yeah, we had a coupon.
wow, the store.
listen, I have to pick up some stuff, so... - What do you have to pick up?
just some stuff.
so, I'll talk to you later tonight.
I'll go in with you. - Why?
because, otherwise, I'd have to go home.
home is good. - My home?
actually, I don't have to go in.
okay, then I guess I will go home.
great. Go. Bye.
Bye. Freak.
Rory! Hello.
try a plum. They're better than sex. - No, thanks.
fresh fruit always has such a sensuality about it.
are you too young for this? - Definitely.
what are you here for, honey? - Well, I just...
I see what you're here for.
that wouldn't fit in a basket. No.
Patty, it's not like that. He's just a person.
a person? - A boy-type person.
my favorite kind. - I really don't even know him.
right. You don't know him? - I don't.
you said. - Please don't say anything.
I promise I won't tell a soul that you don't know that young man.
thank you. - You're welcome.
ma'am, what are you doing?
please, honey, don't call me ma'am. It makes me feel older than 25.
here, have a pea pod.
I'm assuming you'll pay for the food that you've consumed on the premises.
so brusque.
and you are? - I'm the new assistant manager here.
listen here, my fine friend, who, if he had a better hairstyle...
I might consider dating. I do this all the time.
not from now on. I'm sorry.
wait a minute. I've been sampling food at this establishment for years.
if you put something in that mouth that doesn't belong there,
I'll remove it and then call the police.
is this all you want? A head of lettuce and a mousetrap?
that should do it. - That's a couple of must-need items there.
$2. 27. - I only have $1.
I can loan you the rest. - No, I'll just take the lettuce.
perfect. You could use half of it for a salad...
then use the other half to clobber the mouse with.
paper or plastic? - I'm fine.
Lorelai? - Max. Hi.
small world? - Absolutely.
what are you drinking? - Coffee.
plain coffee?
I wanted some cream, but that prompted a very elaborate foam conversation.
the disapproval I got when I said I didn't want foam, just cream,
rivaled the one from my dad when I told him I wanted to teach.
wow, so it's been a tough outing for you.
it's getting better.
what can I get you? - Coffee, please.
so, here we are.
here we most certainly are. - Running into each other.
away from school. - And its unique strictures.
these things do happen. - Fate can be funny.
should we cut the cute and just get to it?
I think we should date. - Why?
because I think we both want to. - I want to be in The Bangles.
it doesn't mean I quit my job and get a guitar and ruin my life
to be a Bangle. Does it?
the Bangles broke up. - That's not the point.
it's got to be part of it, if there's no band anymore.
I repeat my question. Why should we date?
because we're clearly attracted to each other.
I'm attracted to pie. It doesn't mean I feel the need to date pie.
okay, then, because we are... of similar heights.
Wow. Round 1 and already tapped.
look, I know that you are concerned about the appearance of us dating.
Yes, I am.
I can tell you I'm the soul of discretion, when it comes to delicate relationships.
dated a lot of Chilton moms?
no, I meant any relationship, work, family.
so you have things to hide in all aspects of your life. Very interesting.
do you have any hemlock back there? Arsenic, something quick.
do you like rap music? - Yeah.
me, too.
italian food? - Yeah.
me, too.
you telling me what I want to hear? - Yeah.
I knew it.
doesn't mean it doesn't coincide with how I feel.
if you're telling what I wanna hear then I'm not getting to know you.
if I know what you want to hear, it shows my understanding of you...
far exceeds your understanding of me.
who's the one lagging?
Wow. Round 1 and already tapped.
Rory is my life. She's my pal. My everything.
and I would never ever do anything that would hurt her.
but Rory is not a baby anymore. - Don't say that.
she's eight, and her favorite hobby is making necklaces out of gum wrappers.
you could try stunting her growth, keeping her in a box,
blowing cigarette smoke on her.
you are so taking this out of context.
when my uncle was a young man...
there was this girl who lived across the street from him...
and he was completely in love with her. But he never talked to her.
he knew in his gut that this was the girl he wanted to spend his life with.
this is gonna be sad, isn't it?
let me finish. - It's gonna be sad.
so, anyhow, my uncle watches this girl...
waiting for the right moment to approach her.
next thing he knows, he gets drafted. - I'm going for the Kleenex.
now, he thinks, "This is perfect. I'll come back...
I'll have a career, I'll have served my country. I'll be worthy of her love."
when he gets back, she's gone.
moved away. No one knew where.
and he never saw that girl again.
now, my uncle, he didn't say much to me.
but the one thing that he did say...
was that if there's something in your gut...
that you know you feel is right...
you got to go after it, no matter what.
what do you say?
maybe dinner...
wouldn't be such a bad idea.
dinner? You mean we could sit together, even drive together?
just take the card. - I might frame the card.
just use the card. - I definitely will.
what?
that story about your uncle, is that true?
goodbye, Lorelai Gilmore.
thank you.
life is a funny thing, huh?
Yeah, I love that Jim Carrey.
what? - Jim Carrey.
he's just funny. - He is funny.
but then I don't mean funny-funny. I'm being philosophical.
very serious face. Jean Paul Sartre.
I can't talk to you with that face.
how do you guys get any work done?
so why is life such a funny thing?
I met this amazing guy. - Goody!
there's goody stuff about it, but there's baddy stuff, too.
he teaches at Chilton. Max. You met him at the bake sale.
he looked good. - Yeah. Right.
he's so sexy, smart, and funny, and he likes coffee.
God, he sounds perfect for you.
did you get onions? - No.
Luke, you forgot the onions.
I'm just so mixed up. This is a real crossroads situation.
it's like: To perm or not to perm. I'm really confused.
for heaven's sake! Go ahead. I'm still listening.
you were about to perm your hair.
I just want to do the right thing.
I don't see what the problem is. - There are many problems.
first: I do not like to involve Rory in my personal life.
I don't want her to deal with that.
I bring some guy home, and he might not be the guy...
but then she gets all attached to him, and then all of a sudden I decide...
that I don't like the way he eats, or he hums incessantly...
or the way he smacks his lips, or how his hair isn't his own.
then I break up with him, and Rory is the one who gets hurt.
I totally understand. - This guy is her teacher.
I can't keep him out of her life. She sees him every day.
are you the open-faced turkey? - Yep.
I added a little fresh lemon and a little cayenne pepper.
you're gonna plotz!
you do know that Rory's not a baby anymore?
that's what he said.
maybe I'm being too serious, right? Maybe I should loosen the rules a bit.
Plus, it would be great to get, you know. - What?
you know. - No, I don't.
you know.
he knows.
you know? - Yeah, I know.
Sookie! - I was looking for your paprika.
what have I said about the counter? - I know.
how the counter is a sacred space, my sacred space.
you don't do yoga on the Dalai Lama's mat.
and you don't come behind my counter. Period!
I was trying to help!
you bring her again, I want her on a leash! I mean it.
he does make a damn fine burger though.
he does at that.
all right. I'm just gonna keep it simple. I'll tell Rory.
if there's even an ounce of weirdness about it, I'll cancel.
you haven't told Rory yet? - No.
Oops. - No, not oops.
the timing hasn't been right. This is a very delicate, fragile situation.
it's like your soufflés. If you don't do it right, it's a disaster.
and you have to order it 45 minutes in advance.
my soufflés. - Right.
but I wasn't speaking directly about your souffle.
I was speaking metaphorically.
so you don't like my soufflés? - How do we work together?
mom, you better come.
honey, what's wrong? - It's Cinnamon.
Babette? Honey? - Lorelai, come in.
she's gone.
Cinnamon's gone. - I'm so sorry.
is there anything I can do for you, Morey?
this is life, Rory. It breaks your heart.
she looked like she was sleeping.
I thought she was asleep, so I nudged her and she didn't wake.
I gave her a push and she rolled off the couch...
and since I'd just waxed the floor, she went shooting across the room.
and then she knocked over the lamp and she still didn't move.
I knew it was over. Oh, God, my baby.
tell me it wasn't the...
Morey, don't do this to yourself. He thinks it was the clams.
she saw me eating them, and she gave me that, "Hey, man, what's up?" look.
it wasn't the clams.
Morey, in human years, this cat was 260 years old.
that's a good long life.
listen, why don't you let me take her out to the van?
and then I'll get out of your way. - No, stay.
all of you, please stay. Cinnamon would want you here.
we'll stay as long as you want.
I'll never eat clams again. - Me either.
they said that they rolled her body into a lamp?
did you laugh?
did you want to?
but it's sad. - Yeah, it's sad.
Hello?
Hello, where is Lorelai? I'm dropping something off.
Yoo-hoo, heehaw man, where's Lorelai Gilmore?
thank you. I could not get back to the Inn.
what? You are having a party, and I was not invited?
sweetie, it's not a party. It's a wake.
Really? Who died? - Their cat.
you are mourning a cat? - Yes.
they lick their privates, these cats.
not the comforting chit-chat we're looking for.
goodbye. I'll talk to you later. Thank you.
babette, Morey, I came as soon as I heard.
darling, what do you need? - A little air, honey.
what you got in the bag? - Bricks.
Yeah, good one. - Bless you both!
everyone's starved. Come in.
okay, how should we do this?
we'll create a flow through the room to avoid bottlenecks.
people coming in the front door will want a beverage.
put them on the first table, then the hors d'oeuvres next to that...
leaving one hand free to greet the people.
then, back there, set up plates and cutlery.
first the salads, then the meat, then the desserts on the bench.
how's that sound? - Dig in!
I wasn't expecting you. - Or me you. I mean, you me.
I mean, come on in, you.
do you know him? - No.
no?
he goes to my old school, so I see him there sometimes...
but I go to Chilton now. - Thanks for the update.
you're welcome.
do you have a second? - No, I have gum.
no, thanks. Look... - I have to get back.
okay, sure.
I'll see you later.
mom?
isn't that... - No!
that's Mr. Medina. - Tonight's Thursday.
am I in trouble?
did the school call or something? - No, you're great.
let me just come back in just one second.
wait, what's going on? - I'll tell you in a minute.
tell me now. - Max is here.
Max? - Max is here to pick me up.
pick you up for...
I'm gonna talk to him real quick, and I'm gonna be right back.
I was knocking, but no one answered.
I know. I was at the neighbors' house.
Max, I should have called you sooner, but...
you're canceling. - I know it's totally last-minute.
I'm heartbroken. - I completely forgot about our date.
and forgettable. - No, you're memorable.
I've been memorizing you all week.
it's just, we had a little emergency.
Rory? Is Rory okay? - Rory's fine. It's the neighbors' cat.
the neighbors'... - Cat, she died.
she died. - This was a very fat, very beloved cat.
I see.
I like you.
and I don't want to force something on you that you don't want.
no. Wait. Max, you're not forcing anything on me.
I am telling the truth about the cat.
Max, please don't read that much into this.
call me, and we'll reschedule. I promise that's what I want.
are you sure?
cross my heart and hope that no other neighborhood pets die on that day.
okay, I'll call.
good.
I'm sorry about... - Cinnamon.
stupid cat! Couldn't have held on one more day?
is that meatloaf? - Yeah.
you use ketchup?
you gonna make fun of my mother, too? - Sorry.
my Roquefort puffs would complement that dish quite well.
it's fine on its own. Thank you. - Right.
okay, toss some on the plate.
can I make a pretty design? Maybe make some layers?
right. Tossing them on. Got it.
have you guys seen Rory anywhere?
Yeah, I think she headed that way. - Okay, thanks.
excuse me, ma'am?
well, if it isn't Kirk the Jerk.
I want to apologize for what happened at the store yesterday.
I'm listening.
I wasn't aware you were the Miss Patty.
the owner tells me you're one of our best customers...
and that you can put anything in that mouth that you want.
those were his words. I could have paraphrased.
stop sweating and close your pores, Kirky. I always forgive.
thank you. - Once.
babette. - Hello, sugar.
can I get you something? - No, I'm fine. I'm looking for Rory.
I think she might be in the bathroom. - Thanks.
can I help you with something? - No.
I thought I'd just get some of this stuff packed away.
it's like a scene from the kitty version of Valley of the Dolls.
Yeah, you never realize how old they actually are...
till you look in the medicine cabinet.
these were for her heartworms.
for her thyroid, her kidneys...
for the rash she got from taking these...
and these were for the tics she developed from taking the stuff for the rash.
and these are... These are mine.
damn. I'm gonna miss that old broad.
I know.
you know, I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself now.
you live to take care of your kids.
I know, sweetie, but you gave her everything you had.
she was so tiny when I got her, she could sleep in my shoe.
the other day, I came across a hat that I made for Rory.
it was like a doll hat. - They grow up so fast.
and then they take your clothes.
I guess, eventually, you have to move on.
figure out what your life is gonna be...
when you're not busy taking care of somebody else.
jeez, look at this place. Not a clean glass in sight.
let me help you with that.
here, sugar, use this.
morey sits on it when he helps me.
how does Morey get around in here? - Just fine.
he had a couple of concussions his first year here.
but he never complains.
he's just the best thing.
don't know what I'd do without him.
what do you mean without him?
I saw on Oprah a few weeks ago...
she had on couples who lost a child.
most of the marriages went belly up for the pain of it all.
even though they loved each other.
babette, that is not gonna happen to you.
I never thought a man would ever even want me.
I know the feeling.
please, with that ass? Give me a break.
I mean, want me for more than my ass.
for me. The whole package.
annoying neuroses and all. - You'll find him.
it might even be that stud that drove out of here in that Mustang.
did you see him? - Yes.
what a jaw. - Right. He's got a great jaw.
how is he in the sack? - I haven't gone out with him yet.
will you tell me how he is when you do?
I'll call you during the cigarette.
that's Cinnamon's song.
I can't find Rory anywhere. - I'm sure she's around.
Max showed up for the date I forgot about, and she saw him.
you haven't told her. - No.
Oops. - Stop with the oops.
okay, calm down. It's not that big of a deal.
her teacher showed up on her porch to take out her mother.
she'll understand. You're crazy. She knows that.
enough of the comforting, Sookie. - Sorry.
jeez, you scared me.
Yeah, look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
for what? - I've been kind of bugging you lately.
I thought you maybe liked me, but it's obvious that you're not interested.
so I just wanted to say that I get it.
and I'm not gonna bother you anymore.
wait!
I am interested.
you are? - Yes.
I got to go.
finally. I've been looking everywhere for you.
you found me. - I have some explaining to do.
so sit down in that tiny chair. I'm gonna do it right now.
that man on the porch was your teacher.
mom, I'm a little behind in school...
but not so behind that I don't know who the teacher is. So?
he and I were going to sort of hang out together.
on a date. - No.
on something that could appear like a date to the untrained eye.
and to your daughter's eye? - It was a date.
how long have you been dating him? - This was gonna be the first time.
when were you planning to tell me? On your wedding?
no, by the rehearsal dinner at least.
he's my teacher. - I know.
he teaches me things every day...
in a small classroom with a lot of other kids...
who won't be high-fiving me when they find this out.
I know. I told him this was one of the things I was concerned about.
And? - And he thought we could be discreet.
unbelievable! - Are you mad?
Yes. - Right.
because I'm dating him? - Because you lied to me.
I kept information from you. - Information that I should have had.
it would've come out eventually like the Iran-Contra Scandal.
so you're Oliver North. - No, I'm Fawn Hall.
mom. - She was much prettier.
I can't believe that you didn't tell me about this. Why wouldn't you tell me?
cause I thought you were going to take it bad. Thank God I was wrong.
okay. Listen, I'm sorry. I won't date him. I promise.
I'm not saying that you can't date him.
it's just... This is weird.
I mean, there are a million guys in this world...
and you end up with Mr. Medina.
you think I don't get the weirdness factor?
believe me, the last thing I intended to do was date your teacher.
I believe you. - I really like him, Rory. I can't help it.
it's been a long time since I've felt like this.
you can't always control who you're attracted to.
the Angelina Jolie-Billy Bob Thornton thing really proves that.
I know you don't understand this now, but you will someday.
you'll meet some great guy, and he'll make your head all foggy...
and you won't know what to do with yourself.
sweetie, I won't keep anything from you again. Okay? I promise.
from now on, every aspect of my life is an open book to you.
it's okay. - Really.
I'm not even gonna get dressed until I tell you what I'm thinking of wearing.
fair enough. - Okay.
tomorrow, I'm thinking...
the purple tiger top, the black leather skirt, the panda-bear underwear?
good.
but of course I'm totally open to suggestions.
here's one: Get some help.
let us know if we can do anything. - You've done too much already.
good night, Babette. - Good night, sugar.
good night, Morey. - Stay cool, Rory.
it's getting late.
let's stay outside awhile, baby.
look for the Big Dipper. - Okay, I'd like that.
hello. - I've been trying to get you all afternoon.
mom? - Yes.
you already said that. - But someone hasn't.
hello.
there we go. - You are impossible to reach.
there's no messages on the machine.
I don't leave messages.
if I wanted to talk to a machine, I'd talk to my VCR. Where were you?
at a wake. - A what?
a wake. A funeral.
a funeral? Whose? - It was for the neighbors'...
cat.
hold on. I'm looking up "aneurysm" in our medical dictionary to see if I just had one.
I just wanted to be honest with you, Mom. Silly me.
a cat? - Yeah, it was a cat's funeral.
you skipped your own cousin's funeral for a cat funeral?
not my cousin. My father's grandmother's sister's girl who I never...
you said you can't be away from the Inn.
I couldn't at the time, but I worked it out. - For a cat.
it's late. I have a big day tomorrow, Mom.
what? You're going to a raccoon's wedding?
good night, Mother. - Good night.
she's working for a sedative manufacturer.
keeping that demand sky-high.
you shouldn't have told her.
I don't know what to tell and what to hide.
so, we never did quite settle the whole dating-your-teacher issue.
I won't go out with him if you don't want me to.
you can go out with whoever you want.
it's whoever we want.
I'm certainly not gonna go out with him 'cause that'd be really weird.
but I mean it. I won't see him if you don't want me to.
if there's anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, big or small...
then he's out of there. - Good to know.
because, you know, it's not like I'm desperate.
I mean, there are plenty of other guys out there.
sure are.
and it's not like I have to ask your permission.
I mean, this is a courtesy. - Okay.
I'm gonna be up for a while if you want to get back to me on this.
I know where you are.
tomorrow our lawyer, Joseph Stanford, is coming by.
crazy Sissy's dad. - That's terrible. You were good friends.
she spoke to her stuffed animals, and they answered.
let's start a new topic. - You're impossible.
she said a new topic.
everything's a joke. Everyone's a punch line.
okay, I'm sorry.
my daughter, Henny Youngman.
sorry for that. A little trouble in our China office.
well, what did I miss?
I was being impossible. Then I turned into a Jewish comedian.
continue. - Thank you. Where was I?
joseph Stanford is coming tomorrow.
Yes. So, Rory, your grandfather and I thought it might be nice after dinner...
to go around the house and pick out what you'd like us to leave you in our will.
take a look at that desk in my office. It's a really fine Georgian piece.
why don't I ever bring a tape recorder to these dinners?
anything you want to leave me is fine.
nonsense. You should have what you like. Just look around.
when you see something you like, stick a Post-it on it.
okay, you two have officially hit a new level of weird that even I marvel at.
you can pick out things, too. - Now it's way less creepy.
did you hear that, Richard? Apparently we're creepy.
Yes, well, you live and learn.
Oh, cool. - What's that?
it's dessert. - It's pudding.
if you knew what it was, why did you ask?
you don't like pudding. - Yes, but you like pudding.
I love pudding. I worship it.
I have a bowl up on the mantel...
with the Virgin Mary, a glass of wine, and $1 next to it.
I've never had pudding from a crystal bowl before.
you like the bowl?
put a Post-it on it when you're done.
so, what do we think of this?
where would we put it? - I don't know.
the Emily and Richard Gilmore Psycho Museum?
this is the strangest evening I've ever spent here.
so, how are we doing?
great. Just getting ready for the big day.
very nice. - It's getting late, Mom.
unless you've got some funeral plots for us to decorate, we should be going.
any special requests for dinner next week?
mom, I want to talk to you for a minute.
and, Rory, why don't you go say goodbye to Grandpa?
very smooth.
shall I sit down?
Yeah, but not there, okay? We got a Post-it on that.
we'd like to keep it nice.
it must be very exhausting to be you.
mom, Rory's birthday is next Friday. - I know that.
so, we were thinking maybe we could push our dinner next week to Saturday.
What're you going to do on Friday? - I don't know...
come here, and we'll have a little party.
can we do it another night? - Why another night when her birthday is...
on the exact night that you come here.
saturday's a good night. - Not as good as Friday.
pretty close. - Not from where I'm standing.
move then.
I'm sorry. Friday nights are my nights.
that's what we agreed on when you borrowed money for her school.
I didn't intend for this loan to become a constant source of blackmail, okay?
this is my kid's birthday, and she will have her party at home on Friday,
and that's it.
end of story.
so, how would you like two parties this year?
you couldn't get her to cave. - No.
but she did agree to make the string quartet learn Like a Virgin.
well, you tried.
sweetie, I promise, Saturday night we'll do it up right at home.
a Stars Hollow extravaganza.
so, is this party Grandma's having going to be a big deal?
not really.
the government will close that day. Flags will fly at half-mast.
Barbra Streisand will give her final concert again.
the Pope has previous plans, but he's trying to get out of them.
however, Elvis and Jim Morrison are coming...
and they're bringing chips. - You ask a simple question...
mini orange biscuits with honey-mustard ham and cheddar cheese.
angel wings with dipping sauce. - Good.
did you bring me the picture? - Yes.
too bad you couldn't get your mom to relinquish Friday.
she has her Vulcan death grip on that. - Not that surprising though.
Emily Gilmore. You could set your watch by her.
you know what she did do last night? - Wore jeans.
served pudding. - I was close.
I'm sure it was some expensive form of pudding.
but nonetheless, it was pudding!
that is amazing. - Right?
that would mean that she made a mental note that we liked pudding.
which means that she listened to something other than...
the judgmental conga line in her head, and got over the fact that...
to her, pudding is hospital food, and only acceptable...
when you've just had a vital organ ripped out.
that's some journey she had to take there.
open your mouth and close your eyes. - Who are you talking to?
right, sorry.
open your mouth and close your eyes. - Okay.
get ready for something truly amazing.
what is it? - I don't know.
it's like a... - A what?
it's like a berry, but way more exotic. - Yes. Good.
have you been having reactions to your fertilizer fumes again?
for some time now I've been toying with cross-pollination.
finally, I've got it.
I figured out a way to cross a raspberry with a kumquat.
Kumquat! That's what I taste! - Are you serious?
how did you do this?
you didn't build a machine like in The Fly, did you?
will we find you wandering the streets with a raspberry head crying, "Eat me"!
you!
you can make fun of me all you want to, because today I am a god.
today Mother Nature has bowed down to me!
how nice for her.
Michel, Jackson... - No need to fill me in.
I'm quite happy being ignorant of whatever it is...
that is making him raise his arms over his head.
do you need me? - The landscaper does.
Rory's birthday party is Saturday night.
so start thinking up reasons why you can't come.
I'm going to be out of town. - You used that last year.
I'll work on it and get back to you. - 7: 00. Presents mandatory.
Rasquat?
Lucy, I'm home! - Kitchen.
and Justin is just so dreamy. He can't marry Britney.
I'll just cry, cry, and cry.
okay, thanks.
pizza's on its way. - You're such a good provider.
I'm gonna go start my homework. Call me when the pizza guy gets here.
Hello? - Lorelai, what is your work schedule?
Why? - I want to go shopping.
with me? - I think that goes without saying.
only in your world. - I want to get Rory a birthday present.
I'm sure whatever you get her, she'll love.
I want to get her something special.
something that you would get her.
okay, fine. You can get her the bong then.
this isn't funny. I hardly see the girl. We only get to talk at dinner once a week.
and then it's all about school, and Jane.
lane, Mom.
I thought you might let me into your secret club just this one time,
and help me buy her something for her birthday.
you're serious? - According to you, I'm always serious.
okay? - Okay.
well, good.
I'll meet you at Damion's, tomorrow at 3: 00.
okay.
and dress... - Don't finish that sentence, Mom.
I'll see you tomorrow. - Attagirl.
what, Tristan? - I wanted to say, "Happy birthday."
it's not my birthday. - No, but it will be.
on Friday at 4: 03 in the morning, Lorelai...
what is that?
who else got these?
I don't know. Everyone in our class, I think.
I have to go.
I'll see you Friday, birthday girl.
that's her.
my parents are making me go.
another obligation party. - My life stinks.
isn't this lovely? - Oh, yeah.
as soon as we have her crowned Queen of England, we'll give it to her.
you are so combative today. - Hot weather does that to me.
mom, look. This is good.
what is that?
it's a purse shaped like a guitar. This is great.
great for what? - For Rory.
what would Rory do with this? - Put stuff in it and carry it.
in public? - Yes.
what would people think? - That she's an ax murderer, of course.
what about pearls?
pearls?
a double string of pearls with a cashmere sweater set.
mom, she's a young girl. Think of something young.
a Montblanc pen?
to put on her desk at the law firm? - She needs to write.
not with a $200 pen, she doesn't.
Oh, hey, look.
these day planners are adorable.
you could get her the funky eraser with the mermaid on it. She'll love that.
please be serious. We're shopping for Rory.
I'm shopping for her. You're shopping for an imaginary grandchild, Barbara Hutton.
I want to get her something nice.
you asked for my help, but you're not listening.
you wanted me to get her a Filofax and a mermaid eraser.
it's one suggestion. - Yes.
and the T-shirt with the Farrah Fawcett face.
a hero to many who aspire to the perfect feather flip.
I don't know how to do this. Let's just go.
no. Come on, Mom. You do know how to do this.
think pudding.
pudding?
come on, you asked for my help.
you're reaching out. A little, not a lot. Don't get freaked.
but, Mom, pudding. - Why do you keep saying "pudding"?
just look around and pick up something you think she might like.
here.
now, that's really good.
Really? - Absolutely.
looks like something you could buy at a car wash?
totally. That's half the charm.
Oh, no, it's only $12. - $6 more than a car wash.
$12 is not a present.
$12 is a perfect present, Mom. She'll love that.
can I at least get her the pashmina also?
fine, I'll get it. - Good choice.
it lights up.
she's not here yet.
all right. You'll have to entertain me until she arrives.
okay, burger boy, dance.
will you marry me? - What?
just looking for something to shut you up.
better be nice to me, or I'm not inviting you...
to Rory Gilmore's birthday celebration this Saturday night.
you don't have to ask me, you know.
I know. But I would like you to come.
yeah? - Yeah.
okay, I'll see. - 7: 00. Don't be late.
wow, nice face you got on there.
coffee. - Bad day?
I've now used the word "suck" so much that it's lost all meaning to me.
maybe this will cheer you up.
what? - You'll see.
what is that? - These are our party dresses.
so it's a Halloween party?
listen, you. So I'm shopping today with your grandmother,
and it's a whole three hours of, "Who are you buying that for, Mom?
have you met Rory?" And then finally I talked and she listened.
she wound up getting you something I think you're gonna like.
Really? - Yes, really.
and she insisted on buying us these dresses.
but I think I can do something to make them better.
I've never seen you so cheery after spending time with Grandma.
it's been a long time since we got together and didn't end up fighting.
it was refreshing. It wasn't exactly fun,
but I didn't get that shooting pain in my eye like I usually do.
that's great. - Yeah.
so I hear you're having a party Saturday.
Yeah. Mom's famous for her blowouts.
the best one was her eighth birthday. - Yeah, that was good.
the cops shut us down. - Shut down an 8-year-old's birthday party?
and arrested the clown.
I don't want to hear any more of this.
so now tell me, why Miss Lemonhead today?
nothing. I'm fine.
I just got an A-minus on a French test that I should have gotten an A on.
honey, an A-minus is awesome.
Yeah, it's fine.
let me see.
maybe we should really embrace the whole tulle thing.
go totally modern Cinderella. What do you think?
it's your birthday.
Yeah, lucky me.
happy birthday, little girl.
I can't believe how fast you're growing up.
Really?
feels slow. - Trust me, it's fast.
what do you think of your life so far? - I think it's pretty good.
any complaints?
I'd like that whole humidity thing to go away.
all right. I'll work on that.
so, do I look older?
Oh, yeah.
you walk into Denny's before 5: 00, you've got yourself a discount.
good deal.
so, you know what I think? - What?
I think you're a great, cool kid, and the best friend a girl could have.
back at you.
and it's so hard to believe that at exactly this time...
many moons ago, I was lying in exactly the same position...
Oh, boy, here we go.
only I had a huge, fat stomach, and big, fat ankles.
and I was swearing like a sailor.
on leave. - On leave, right.
and there I was... - In labor.
and while some have called it the most meaningful experience of your life,
to me it was something more akin to doing the splits...
on a crate of dynamite.
I wonder if the Waltons ever did this.
and I was screaming and swearing...
and being surrounded as I was by a hundred prominent doctors...
I just assumed there was an actual use...
for the cup of ice chips they gave me. - There wasn't.
but pelting the nurses sure was fun.
I love you, Mom.
we're getting to the part where he sees your head.
so there I was, lying...
you shouldn't have to go to school today.
I have to. Latin test. - Jeez. Every day you have a test.
do you have time to learn anything to be tested on?
wrong table. - Since when is there a right table?
since the coffee cake I baked for you, and the stupid balloons I blew up...
are at that table, over there.
you blew up balloons for me? - Yeah.
Luke, you old softy.
I count to three, it's gone. - Thank you.
are you okay? - Yeah, I just...
I'm getting old, Lane.
you seem a little quiet this morning. - I'm just dreading this whole night.
it's bad enough that I have to see these stupid kids from Chilton every day.
but tonight, on my birthday?
I've never even talked to most of them.
I've only been going to this school for a couple of months.
God, they're gonna think I am the biggest freak.
that I need my grandma to get people to come to my party.
what did Lorelai say when you told her?
I didn't. - Why not?
because of the pudding. - Right, I forgot about the pudding.
grandma served us pudding the other night.
then she went shopping with my mom, and they didn't fight.
I mean, they never get along. And now, suddenly, they're getting along.
I knew that if I told Mom about the invite, she'd wig out and call Grandma,
and that would be the end of the pudding.
you know, you can buy pudding.
it's one night, right? - Right.
I can stand it for one night.
coffee to go, please.
here you go. - Thanks.
why are you smiling? - I'm just thinking about pudding.
no, not there. In the living room.
why are you touching that?
I was just... - Well, don't!
I want those 6 inches apart. Get a ruler.
Emily. - Let me do that.
I hope the Larsons are coming tonight.
Richard, no business. This is your granddaughter's party.
five minutes of shoptalk won't spoil the evening.
five minutes, please. - Emily...
if I ever heard you keep your shoptalk down to five minutes, I'd drop dead.
I could drop dead, and you wouldn't stop talking business.
you'd just step over my body to get to the speakerphone.
what? - You look very nice tonight.
thank you.
jeez, Mom, leave some servants for the rest of the neighborhood.
there she is, the birthday girl. - Hi, Grandma.
wow, you really went all out.
I wanted everything to be perfect. What do you think?
Edith Wharton would have been proud, and busy taking notes.
here, babe, go change. - Okay.
hurry.
what is that? - That's my dress.
Where's the one I bought you? - This is it.
I thought there was more of it.
mom, the place looks great. - Did you turn Rory's into a hat?
nice candles. 6 inches apart?
you're drinking white wine tonight? No Scotch?
excuse me. I'm going to sit over there with my daughter.
here.
what is it? - Shirley Temple.
what are you drinking? - A Shirley Temple Black.
I got your Good Ship Lollipop right here, mister.
so, do you want something to eat?
everything smells funny.
there you are. Come. There're some people I want you to meet.
Lorelai? - Yeah.
Oh, my God! Oh, Mitzi, wow, I haven't seen you since your seventh month.
I was gonna say high school, but okay.
Oh, no. Did I say something rude? - No.
no, I did. I said something rude. I've been trying to work on that.
well, a noble goal.
ever since my divorce, I've been really trying to work on myself.
I just... I want to grow.
Lorelai Gilmore, the scandal girl.
now, tell me, what ever happened with Christopher?
christopher is in California. - Do you hear from him?
I'm sorry, is this painful for you to talk about?
when did he last call you?
you're making progress with that rude thing.
sorry. - It's okay.
he calls, like, once a week. And we see him at Christmas,
sometimes Easter. It's all very civil.
so are you married now? - No, it's just me and Rory.
your cat? - My kid. She's right over there.
you can really see Christopher in her, can't you?
Yes, you can. - Does that kill you?
you know what? I see someone else, and it's been great.
no, those aren't the terms we agreed on. - They most certainly are.
you were at the same meeting as I was.
we spelled out a five-year extension, not a three-year one.
I heard three.
Hey, Grandpa. - Rory.
gentlemen, this is my granddaughter, Rory.
happy birthday, Rory.
I think we should get Dennis on the phone right now.
fine, I've got a phone in my office.
Rory, there's a group of your school friends in the library.
let's go say hello to them.
I have to go to the bathroom.
just say hello first. Come on, I'll hold those for you.
who's that? - I think it's her party.
Paris?
my parents made me come. - Oh, God!
otherwise I wouldn't be here.
you believe me, don't you?
Oh, coming to greet me?
Hello, Tristan.
so where's my birthday kiss? - It's my birthday.
so I'll give you a birthday kiss. - What is wrong with you?
okay, I gotta tell you something.
I'm madly in love with you. - Well, good luck with that.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.
I wake up in the middle of the night calling out your name. Rory.
would you shut up please?
Rory, who's your friend?
I don't know, but this is Tristan. - Excuse me?
Tristan Dugray, sir. - Dugray?
are you any relation to Janlen Dugray? - That's my grandfather, sir.
I've done business with Janlen for years.
he's a fine man. - That he is.
you have very good taste in friends. I approve.
Richard, I've got Dennis on the phone and he heard the same thing I heard.
well, one wrong man can always find a friend.
he likes me. - He's drunk.
let's take a walk.
this is stupid. You don't even like me.
you have this weird need to prove that I'll go out with you.
that's not liking someone.
why are you fighting this? You're gonna give in eventually.
I'm gonna go find my mother.
wow, meeting your mom.
it's a bit sudden, but okay, I'm ready.
there you are.
I think it's time you said a few words to your guests.
what? - Just a little speech to say thank you,
and tell everyone how it feels to be a year older.
I don't think... - She's the hostess.
this is her responsibility. - I am not the hostess. You are.
honey, hold on.
this is your party, and these are your guests.
I don't have anything to say to them. So you give the speech. Excuse me.
what was that all about?
Lorelai, your daughter has no manners whatsoever.
you should be ashamed of yourself.
how did this become my fault?
can I come in? - It's your room.
how are you doing?
I'm sorry I snapped at Grandma.
that was a pretty Freaky Friday moment we had back there.
she just went ahead and invited all those kids from Chilton.
you're kidding. I thought she checked on that with you.
she didn't ask me or tell me. - Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
I don't know, but it really made me mad.
honey, why didn't you tell me? - Because you were happy.
it's not often that there's peace between you two.
I didn't want to screw everything up.
I appreciate you wanting Mom and I to get along,
but you shouldn't keep such stuff from me.
I feel terrible. I mean, I've never yelled at her before.
listen, you'll apologize. All will be forgotten.
you'll see.
it's like time has stood still in this room.
it must be weird for you to be in this room now.
it was weird for me to be in this room then.
you know, they gave this to me with the glass on.
I now officially know what it feels like to have grown up here.
it's not official until you're huddled in a corner, eating your hair.
do you remember your last birthday here?
we had just had a fight, and I was lying on the bed just like you are now.
what did you fight about?
I was pregnant. - That.
and I said something at the table about the pate smelling like Clorox...
and one thing led to another, and I wound up here.
they hadn't told anybody yet about me and you.
that must have been really hard on them. - Yeah.
I remember when I finally told them,
it was the only time they ever looked small to me.
I guess I'd better go find Grandma. - Give her a minute...
there you are. ...she'll find us.
you are both being very rude. This isn't my birthday party, you know.
sorry, Mom. - Honestly, the way the two of you act.
grandma, I just want to say... - We'll talk about this later. Now go.
thank you. Good to see you.
lovely as always, Leeza.
my best to Darren.
great party. One of your best.
I even liked those brown mushroom things.
grandma, can I talk to you for a sec?
Richard, the girls are leaving.
Rory, I hope you had a good time. - Yeah, I did.
I know your grandmother has already bought you a gift,
and signed my name to it.
that was part of our agreement when we got married.
however, I feel this occasion calls for something a little extra.
put that towards your trip to Fez.
Oh, Grandpa. - You're a good girl, Rory. Happy birthday.
I don't deserve this. - Fine. Hand it over.
you should get going. You've got quite a drive ahead.
grandma, we're having a party tomorrow at our house.
it won't be anything like this,
but it will be fun. Maybe you and Grandpa could come.
that's very sweet, but I'm afraid we already have plans.
okay. - Have a safe trip.
lock the door behind you.
why don't you go help that guy out there put all the presents in the car?
mom, come to the party tomorrow. - I can't. I'm busy.
throw those out. We won't eat them.
your granddaughter invited you to her birthday party. Please come.
I've already been to a party for my granddaughter,
and she humiliated me in front of all my friends.
I have no desire to relive that experience.
the cheeses must be put in individual bags.
mom, come on. Give her a break.
you invited all these Chilton kids without asking her.
they're her schoolmates. I assumed they were her friends.
you know what they say when people assume things.
no, what do they say?
that you shouldn't. - Very clever.
mom, she didn't want them here. She doesn't like them.
I had to invite them.
that's good manners, something your daughter is sorely lacking.
you're doing the same thing to her that you always did to me.
you try to control her. When that doesn't work you shut her out.
I'm too tired for your accusations right now.
can we do this tomorrow? I'll find you a pen,
so you can write down your insults so you won't forget them.
this is not funny. I have a crushed kid out in the car.
what do you want me to say?
everything's fine. It's forgotten. There. I'll see you next week.
so I guess the whole pudding thing was just a fluke, huh?
trying to get to know us, easing up on the rules,
smudging that bottom line of yours. It was just some weird phase.
you were on cold medicine last week or something?
Oh, so I'm a villain now, is that it? I spent a fortune on this party.
I spent days planning it, making sure every detail was perfect, the food, the linen, the music.
I did all this for Rory.
that's not what she needed.
what she needs is for you to accept her apology,
and come to her party. That's what she needs.
you don't care what she needs. - How dare you?
you don't know what she needs because you don't know her.
you've never tried to know her, like you never knew me.
I know you. - You don't know anything about me.
you'd like to think that. That you're some huge mystery?
why does Lorelai do that?
I don't know. She's a mystery to me.
you're not so mysterious, Lorelai. - No. What am I then?
right now you're very loud and disruptive to the cleaning process.
what do I have to do to get you to put the damn cheese in individual bags?
fine. I give up.
if I had a dollar for every time you gave up.
then you could pay for this party, couldn't you?
I made coffee.
hangover?
Emily. - Got it. Moving on.
good morning. - Morning, popcorn.
you want some pancakes? - No, I've gotta get going.
where? - The college fair is today.
so you're going to get another Harvard brochure?
I just wanna see if they've changed the pictures.
weirdo.
I'll be back in plenty of time to help you decorate.
this is your party. You do not work.
you mock those who are. Have I taught you nothing?
sorry. I'll try to be better. Bye. - Okay, bye-bye.
new brochure? - Yes.
what are you doing here? - There's a college fair going on.
no. I mean what are you doing here? - I'm getting a new brochure.
Why? - Because they're not selling pizza.
Oh, no. - You can't.
you're applying to Harvard? - Yes.
ten generations of Gellers have gone to Harvard.
I have to go to Harvard.
I can't believe this. - You can go somewhere else.
go to Brandeis. Brandeis is nice.
I've only ever wanted to go to Harvard.
that's it. Nowhere else.
it's a big school. - I guess.
we'll probably never see each other. - You think?
if we do, we duck. - Okay.
are you dating Tristan? - What? No way.
do you like him? - Not even a little.
Really? - Really.
nice party. - Thanks.
Hi, everybody. Happy birthday, Rory.
Oh, my God.
open it.
No! - Do you like it?
you can take it back. - No, I love it.
it's perfect. - It's blue, and it has a handle.
it's way too expensive. - I know.
that's what I told the guy at the store. - On three, because I'm gonna drop it.
one, two...
make a wish.
all right, everybody, I need your attention. Attention, please.
this is a very serious moment.
two priests, a rabbi, and a duck...
mom. - All right, I'm kidding.
I would like to propose a toast...
to the one thing in my life that is always good...
always sweet...
and without whom I would have no reason to get up in the morning.
my pal Rory. Cheers.
here's to you, birthday girl.
and in honor of this very special girl,
I now invite you all to help me eat her face.
and you may have the first cut.
there's something very strange about hacking into my own head.
jeez, who the hell's ringing the bell? It's a party. Get your ass in here.
or asses I guess.
grandma, Grandpa...
I can't believe you're here. I'm so glad you came.
Hey, no tie? - I thought I'd mix it up a little.
grandma, look. - Why, it looks lovely.
I want you to meet everyone. Everyone, these are my grandparents.
Lorelai, you look well.
I'm Patricia Lacosta.
we just love your daughter and granddaughter.
thank you.
my God, you're a tall specimen of a man.
must be all that good air in Hartford.
mom, Dad, can I get you a drink?
no, thank you. - You're gonna need one.
I have wine glasses that say "Holiday Inn" on them.
Stoli on the rocks with a twist. - Right.
my parents are here. - No.
I've cursed in front of them twice, Miss Patty tried to hit on my dad,
and I'm sure Mom's gonna call Child Protective Services.
when was the last time they were here? - Never.
not once? - Not since we moved here.
they'd come down and visit us occasionally when Rory was a baby,
and we lived at the Inn, but they have never been here.
that's big stuff. Is Rory thrilled?
through the roof. - Oh, that's great.
Lorelai, I just tried some of those hors d'oeuvres.
they're unbelievable.
who is your caterer? - Sookie.
what's a Sookie? - That's a Sookie.
Hi, Sookie St. James. - Sookie's the chef at the Inn, Mom.
my dear, you are very talented. - Thank you.
you must cater my next party. When my friends get wind of you,
you'll have so much business, you won't know what to do.
but remember, I discovered you.
mom, Sookie has a job. She's the chef at the Inn.
the Inn where we work.
my Inn.
six days a week, Mom. She cooks there every day.
just give her your number or we'll never get out of here.
so, how does it look? - It doesn't look structurally sound.
drink up, Dad.
okay, don't panic.
good opening line. What's wrong? - We're out of ice.
how can we be out of ice?
we had a ton. It was like a penguin habitat in there.
I don't know how it happened.
I just know it happened. Somehow we have to deal with it.
I will go and get some then.
Oh, my God. You're a vision!
Sookie, we have ice. - Hallelujah.
how did you know?
a good rule of thumb is you can never have too much ice.
you're the best!
Hi, Mom. This is my friend Luke.
how do you do? - Fine, thank you.
I'd better get these in the freezer before they melt.
not very likely in here.
Rory, what a lovely party. - I brought you something to read.
it's not The Wall Street Journal.
but there's a quiz there that determines if you're a summer or a fall.
I appreciate this. Thank you.
Morey, you remember the time that Rory decided that our old tree stump was a fairy ring?
I sure do. - How old was she then, sugar?
I think she was about 10.
all I know is that it matched the description.
Oh, God, she was cute.
she used to sit out there with a peanut-butter sandwich,
just waiting for the fairy to get hungry.
okay. New story.
I'm still crushed beyond belief that she quit her ballet lessons.
Oh, not me.
miss Perfect Work Ethic would prance around this room 24 hours a day.
and I still stunk. - I can vouch for that.
that's not true. - She was pretty bad.
don't you listen to them. You had a true gift.
what?
she did. She was talented.
I made that.
Really? - From Rory's old baby clothes.
how nice. I hope you washed them first.
Oh, rats. I knew I forgot something.
that's quite an assortment of characters you have down there.
they're great people.
this Patricia. - Miss Patty.
she teaches dance? - Among other things.
this man with the ice... - Luke.
how long have you been seeing him?
I'm not seeing Luke. He's just a friend.
mom, I swear. Luke keeps me in coffee. Nothing else.
he seems to like you.
and you're judging this by what? - By the way he looked at you.
which was how?
like you were about to give him a lap dance.
mom, he did not look at me like that. - You're pleased.
what? - You smiled.
you're glad that the ice man looked at you like a porterhouse steak.
I'm smiling because you're crazy,
and that's what you do to crazy people to keep them calm.
what's this? - That's me, Mom.
I know it's you. You're wearing a cast.
Yeah. That's when I broke my leg.
you broke your leg? - Yeah, three years ago during a yoga class.
the headstand portion took a very ugly turn.
the good thing was that I brought the smug, blonde, pretzel chick down with me.
I've since learned that I'm a bit too competitive for yoga.
I never knew you broke your leg. - It was no big deal, Mom.
if I had been really sick you would have known.
you could get a maid in here once a week to at least tidy up.
I like it cluttered. - You can't even find the bed.
Yes, I can. It's the thing I crash into on the way to the closet.
I should go check on your father.
it was nice that you came tonight, Mom.
it meant a lot to Rory. Really.
she is my granddaughter, after all.
I should be here. - I totally agree.
leave it, Mom.
it's time to go now. - In a minute, please.
Rory, we're going to get going now. - Thank you for coming.
thank you for asking me.
lovely party.
I enjoyed the reading material immensely.
so what's the verdict? - I am an autumn.
interesting. - Isn't it?
so are you guys leaving? The mud wrestling starts in 10 minutes.
good night, Lorelai. We had a lovely time.
and with a straight face you said that.
I'd have that chimney inspected if I were you.
I'll get right on that, Dad.
for Fez. - But you already took care of Fez.
fez is a very large city.
food fight? - Absolutely.
she's right. I don't know my daughter at all.
we should go. Traffic.
next year we are going to a McDonald's with one of those slides, and that's it.
the party was a hit.
and we'll be eating onion dip for breakfast for a week.
you mix that dip with ground turkey and garlic, and it is really not bad.
I'm not looking for a recipe. - Reflex. Sorry.
I'm gonna go check the living room. - Okay.
you didn't have to get me anything.
sorry. That's the rules. You get older, you get a gift.
I'm sorry about this sort of sneaky thing.
I just haven't told my mother yet about you.
not that there's anything to tell. - It's okay. This is better.
Oh, my God. It's beautiful.
I bought the medallion, and then I just cut some leather straps,
and drilled a hole and, well...
one of us has got to do laundry tonight. - Why?
because I haven't had any clean underwear for three days.
so right now under your skirt you're wearing...
not underwear. - Mom!
it's kind of nice actually. Breezy.
my role model, ladies and gentlemen.
how come you haven't run out yet?
I don't know. I guess I have more underwear than you.
that's not true. You have less.
have you been doing laundry without me? - No.
Rory? - Okay, one load.
you didn't even ask if I had stuff to throw in?
it was a big load. There wasn't any room.
I'm crushed and bleeding. Get me a tourniquet.
no. They're dirty because Rory won't wash them with her stuff.
sorry. I'll do another load tonight, I promise.
never mind. I'll do my own laundry.
fine, even better. - I hate doing laundry.
maybe I'll just buy new underwear.
and flutter, flutter.
and leaves.
where are my leaves?
I got pumpkins, I got Pilgrims. I got no leaves.
every other store in town has fall decorations.
hurrah for the mob mentality.
we're talking a few streamers and a paper turkey.
how is it gonna hurt to have a paper turkey?
no turkeys, no squash, no pumpkins. Nothing colored orange.
okay. So you don't like orange. That's fine.
autumn has many varied hues to toy with.
excuse me, could we get some coffee?
and a muffin? - Warmed?
this is the Autumn Festival.
your shop is right across the street from the horn of plenty.
you're in the middle of everything. You have to decorate.
all I have to do is serve food.
and coffee! - And muffins.
Taylor, I'm tired of having this conversation with you every year.
you have lived in Stars Hollow for a long time, young man.
it's time you became one of us.
sorry, I guess my pod's defective.
my mom's not wearing any underwear.
well, you aren't. - You're being selfish, Luke.
still they don't notice. I can't take it anymore.
we're talking about the spirit of fall.
what muffin do you want? - Blueberry.
you know where you can stick the spirit of fall?
here, don't use your hands.
I don't think you're taking me seriously.
what gave you that idea? No tip?
Yeah, here's a tip: Serve your customers.
here's another: Don't sit on any cold benches.
if you pull those Pilgrims out of your pocket once more...
I'm just doing it for you.
I don't know.
it doesn't really look like the Mayflower.
we could put a sign on it or something.
I don't know.
so, you want to go back to the Plymouth Rock idea?
we'll just live with it that way for a day.
okay, sure.
you know, you can get two for $3. - Really? Excellent deal.
you just had a desperate need for some cornstarch?
Yes, I have very important thickening needs, thank you.
nice apron. - Nice uniform.
I sewed the buttons on with silver thread, so that sets me apart from the crowd.
I should get home. - Wait, you want a pop or something?
a pop?
give me a break. In Chicago they call it pop.
in Connecticut, we call it free soda. And, yes, thank you.
all right, guess what's in each hand, you get the soda.
okay, the whole concept of a free soda is that it's free.
you don't have to work for it.
sorry, you got to sing for your supper. - Or your soda.
guess. - Okay.
in this hand you have...
thank you.
what's wrong? - I got kissed.
and I shoplifted.
are you serious? Who kissed you? - Dean.
the new kid? - Yes.
you got the new kid? Oh, my God.
it happened so fast. I was just standing there.
where? - Doose's Market.
he kissed you in the market? - On Aisle 3.
by the ant spray? - Yes.
that's a good aisle. - What defines a good aisle?
an aisle where you get kissed by the new kid is a good aisle.
Oh, my God, I can't breathe.
okay, sit down. - No, I can't sit down. I'm too...
Oh, my God, he kissed me.
who kissed you? - The Lord, Mama.
okay, then.
so, tell me everything.
so, I go into the store, and he offers me a soda.
then he puts two behind his back and asks me to pick one, and he kissed me.
I'm so jealous. That's it, I've got to get some dumb, ugly friends.
I have to go tell my mom. - Call me later.
okay.
what's wrong? - I can't.
you can't leave? It's hymn night at the Kim house. Make a run for it.
my mom doesn't know about Dean. - So tell her.
the last time the subject of boys came up, it got very ugly.
that was different. She thought you wanted to quit school over a guy.
Yes, over Dean.
okay, fine. But she doesn't have to know it was him.
she'll know. - How?
she'll know. She's Lorelai. What do I do?
maybe she'll be more open to the concept now that you're in school and doing well.
maybe. - Try it.
okay. I got to go.
was it great?
it was perfect.
Wow. - Yeah.
Yeah, can you hear that?
no, it's higher.
it's like a high-pitched kind of a... sound.
it started last week.
but was lower and only happened when we opened the door.
now it's higher and on all the time.
so I think it's really growing in confidence.
look, I've already told this to three other people.
so could you just please tell me what is wrong with this fridge?
I'm not gonna make the noise again.
I'm not...
Jerry, I don't have a lot of pride,
but I do have enough that I do not want to make that noise again.
so could you tell me what is wrong with the fridge,
or connect me with someone who can?
thank you.
Hello, Rusty? Great.
listen, my fridge is making this weird sound.
it's a high-pitched... You know what, is Jerry still there?
okay, have him make the sound. He knows it.
I'll wait.
I know. It does sound bad.
okay, here is the deal.
you will send someone out here tomorrow between 8: 00 and 9: 00.
because I work and can't wait four hours for one of you guys to show up.
great. Goodbye.
so, are they coming tomorrow? - Nope. Monday, between 3: 00 and 8: 00.
I'm completely useless. - I'm sorry.
God, look at this place. It's a sty.
now I'm crabby. I'm crabby and useless.
stupid fridge! Stupid fridge guys.
I hate my life.
hello.
God, quite an entrance. Jeez, my heart.
Rory's not here.
no, I know. I came to pick up that rocker that I bought a couple weeks ago.
six weeks ago. - That's a couple times three. That's six.
math humor.
it's not big with many people. Don't feel bad.
this is not a storage facility. - I know. I'm sorry.
this is a furniture store.
furniture comes in, people buy, then it goes out.
except when Lorelai Gilmore buys. Then furniture stays here for six weeks.
how about I pay you extra? - I don't want you to pay extra.
I want you to pick up the thing you paid for in the first place. Here.
I remember it smaller. - It's been six weeks. Maybe it grew.
right. Once again, I'm really sorry. I've been very busy.
maybe you should be less busy. Then you can remember to pick up chairs.
right. Absolutely. Smell a rose, got it.
and then you could keep your daughter from running around kissing boys.
what? - Lane is a young, impressionable girl.
she doesn't need to hear about your daughter's kissing.
are the lids tight on the paint remover? Because you're sounding loopy to me.
loopy? What's loopy?
Rory's not kissing anybody. - Yes, she is.
she came in here and told Lane she kissed a boy in the grocery store.
the grocery store, where we buy our food.
this does not make any...
she kissed the boy in the grocery store? - Yes.
the boy in the grocery store. Kiss.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
she didn't tell me.
I have to go.
you left your chair!
okay, just one more time.
I have been telling you this story for an hour. It doesn't get dirty.
I can't help it. I'm obsessed. I'm totally living vicariously through you.
Why? You got kissed last weekend.
remember? You told me. That guy your parents set you up with.
the one with the Lincoln Continental. What's his name?
Patrick Cho. - Okay.
let's do a little compare and contrast here.
you get kissed on the mouth by a cute, cool, sexy guy you really like,
and I get kissed on the forehead by a Theology major...
in a Members Only jacket who truly believes rock music leads to hard drugs.
fair enough. You can live through me.
but remember that I have no idea what I'm doing.
I'm aware of that. That's why I've been diligently gathering information for us.
what kind of information? - Let's see.
Dean's from Chicago, which you know. - I do.
he likes Nick Drake, Liz Phair, and The Sugarplastic.
and he's deathly allergic to walnuts. - Walnuts bad, got it.
now, he had a girlfriend in Chicago. - A girlfriend?
her name's Beth. They went out for a year, but split amicably before he left.
now she's dating his cousin,
but he doesn't feel weird, because he doesn't think they were in love.
Beth. - I wouldn't worry about it.
how'd you get all this information?
through his best friend, who, by the way, is really cool.
so once you get settled with Dean, could you ask him about Todd?
Absolutely.
so, Beth?
I hate the name Beth. It's so... Beth.
Todd also said that Dean hasn't been able to talk about anything but you for weeks.
stop it. You're giving me Patrick Cho flashbacks.
Luke, the food here is lovely.
but you know what would make it better?
let me guess. Some Autumn Festival decorations?
food without ambience isn't really food, is it?
more iced tea, Patty?
no, thank you. It's too depressing in here for tea.
you realize Taylor's a head case, right?
Yes, but at least he's a festive one.
just eat.
coffee?
come on, are you mad at me, too?
a man can't choose whether he wants a picture of a fat, stupid bird on his wall?
that's the reason the Pilgrims came here in the first place.
I wasn't snubbing you. I didn't hear you.
now, I'm concerned about you.
sorry, just feeling a little persecuted lately.
coffee? - Please.
are you okay? - I'm fine.
you don't look fine. - Thank you.
I meant you look concerned. - I'm preoccupied.
you look concerned. - I'm not.
fine. You just look it.
you know, some streamers would look great here.
okay, I'm done. - Thank you.
sorry.
save your apologies for the Indians.
people are really in a giving mood today. The horn of plenty is packed.
that's great. Do you want some coffee?
no, I'll just have a sip of yours. I have to get right back.
Really? I thought we were having lunch today.
I can't. We're one Pilgrim short. I only have a couple minutes.
you've been really busy lately. - Yeah.
I guess it's that end-of-the-year rush.
I mean, we haven't even really talked in a couple of days.
what do you want to talk about?
I don't know. Anything.
okay. Did you read that article in the newspaper...
about the polar ice caps melting?
Yeah. Big deal.
fine, you pick the subject. - Okay, great.
I was watching General Hospital the other day,
and they have a new Lucky.
the old Lucky went to play something with a real name.
so, the old Lucky had this girlfriend, Liz...
who thought that he died in a fire.
then they bring on this new Lucky...
and you're like, "That's not the old Lucky..."
because the new Lucky has more hair gel issues.
still, Liz was so upset about his supposed death...
that you could not wait to see them kiss, you know?
when do you have time to watch General Hospital?
okay, let's get back to the point.
what do you think about the whole Liz-Lucky kissing thing?
I think they're actors being paid to play a part,
so it's nice that they're living up to their obligations.
can we finish this very meaningful conversation later?
I promised Lane I'd get right back.
okay. I'll see you later.
okay, bye. - Bye.
I'm not going to say you look concerned.
I won't talk about how you'd look dressed like a guy from The Crucible.
fair enough.
Oh, God!
what are you doing?
I asked you first. - I ran out of cream.
Yeah, me, too.
what are you staring at? - Nothing. Don't look.
what's wrong with you? - Rory got kissed.
what?
Rory had her first kiss. And that guy did it.
the new kid. - Yep.
look at him. Look how smug he is. - He's bagging groceries.
it's hard to be smug bagging groceries. - Look how he handled those lemons.
What're you saying? - He threw them in the bag.
not tossed them or placed them, but threw like they meant nothing.
they're lemons. - They're symbolic.
we need to get you out of here. - No.
that Lothario there has wormed his way into my daughter's heart and mouth, and for that he must die.
- That's it. Let's go.
you're not gonna kill the bag boy. - Why not?
it's double-coupon day. You'll bring down the town.
okay, I'm out. Stop pushing me.
what are you thinking spying like that? - I don't know.
I wanted to see him. I've seen him already but before he was...
Rory's boyfriend? - Shush, you.
she's growing up. - I know.
there's nothing you can do about it.
okay, Mr. Reality, break into somebody else's house.
sorry.
why didn't she tell me? - What?
why didn't Rory tell me about the kiss?
maybe she didn't know you'd take it so well.
you want to hear something crazy?
cause all the talk up until now has been so normal?
he kind of looks like Christopher. - The grocery kid?
Yeah. He looks like Christopher.
and Christopher is Rory's dad?
the hair, the build, something about the eyes.
he reminds me of Christopher. - That's not too surprising.
you're gonna quote Freud? Because I'll push you in front of a car.
this talk was going so well. - You and Rory are a lot alike.
it's not surprising you have similar tastes in men.
I guess.
but why? Why didn't she tell me? We tell each other everything.
this is different. - But we tell each other everything else.
but this she keeps a secret. It's 'cause it's a guy thing.
probably. - That's not good.
I have to make her understand I'm okay with the guy thing,
cause not talking about guys and our personal lives, that's me and my mom.
that is not me and Rory.
are you okay with the guy thing? - Yes.
Really? - Okay-ish.
that's not okay. - That's okay with an "ish."
whatever you say.
she thinks I'll disapprove, right? Well, I won't.
I will show her that I think this is great.
once she sees that I think this is great,
everything will be back to normal between us, right?
right, okay, good.
so you passed the need for an actual person to talk to minutes ago.
Yeah, before the gelato stand. - You're an amazing woman.
thank you for noticing.
sorry I'm late.
no big deal. There's Chinese in the fridge. - Okay.
so, kissed any good boys lately?
who? - Mrs. Kim.
of course.
so, he's cute. - Yeah, he is.
can he spell? - He can spell and read.
how long have you known? - Since this morning.
you didn't think you could keep it a secret.
you were making out in the market. - We weren't making out.
it was just one kiss.
Yeah, by the time that gets to Miss Patty's it's a scene from Nine 1/2 Weeks.
you've known all this time? At Luke's? Here?
Yeah.
you could have said something.
now, funny. I was going to say the same thing to you.
what now? - Now? Nothing.
no? No lecture about kissing a boy?
no. Why, did you do it wrong? - No.
I don't think.
I didn't love the way I found out, but you're getting older.
these things are bound to happen occasionally.
actually, I think it's great. - No, you don't.
Yes, I do. I'm thrilled.
thrilled? - Yeah.
you're completely weirded out by this, aren't you?
no, you're crazy. I'm perfectly fine with it.
you don't seem fine. You seem the complete opposite of fine.
you're projecting that on me, because you don't want to think that I'm fine when I am fine.
okay.
never been finer.
got it.
you want some? - No, thanks. I'm fine.
we must be quick because the video store's gonna close.
so stick to our list. No impulse buying like toothpaste or soap.
Rory? - You know what?
I think we have enough stuff to eat at home.
Really? Where do you live? Because the home I left had nothing.
we're ordering pizza. That's enough. - Are you crazy?
you can't watch Willy Wonka without heaps of junk food.
it's not right. I won't allow it. We're going in.
Rory, it's fine. - It's too weird.
I'm gonna have to meet him eventually. - Okay, how about next year?
I'm going to be so cool in there, you will mistake me for Shaft.
there will be no interrogation. - I swear.
no kissing noises. No stories from my childhood.
no referring to Chicago as ChiTown.
no James Dean jokes. No father-with-a-shotgun stares.
no Nancy Walker impressions. - Come on.
promise me. - I really and truly promise.
now can we please go to the market?
okay, let's go.
I don't see him.
all right, maybe he's on a break.
Yeah, maybe he's on a break.
okay, good. So we can shop. - Yep.
do we want marshmallows?
and jellybeans. And chocolate Kisses.
cookie dough we have at home, peanut butter...
do they have that thing with a sugar stick on one side,
but you dip it in sugar on the other side and eat it?
we are gonna be so sick. It's amazing that we still function.
there he is.
boy, he's tall. That must have been some back-bender, that kiss.
make sure you warm up next time.
okay, we are leaving now. - Sorry. Done now.
he's got great eyes. You got to love a guy with great eyes.
and a nice smile. - Very nice.
think we can get him to turn around? - It's nice, too.
Really? - Trust me.
you girls having another movie night?
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.
isn't that the one with Gene Hackman? - Gene Wilder.
you're a Wonka fan? - Yeah.
Dean, this is my mom, Lorelai. And, Mom, this is Dean.
nice to meet you, Dean. - Yeah, you, too.
nice apron. - Thanks.
$41. 83. - Wow.
it's expensive to slowly rot your insides, isn't it?
here you go.
thank you. - You're welcome.
so, Dean, nice meeting you. Hope to see you again.
see, that wasn't so bad. - You're right.
I said nothing embarrassing, nothing stupid.
I appreciate that. - So chill out, supermarket slut.
see, even a little information in your hands is dangerous.
I need coffee. - The video store closes in 10 minutes.
you run to the video store, and I'll go get coffee.
go. I'll meet you at Luke's.
you forgot your Red Vines.
Wow! You totally saved the night!
Thanks. - Sure.
what are you doing tonight? - Me?
well, I don't know.
do you want to come over? We're ordering pizza, we got a movie.
neighborhood's got a pool to see who falls into a sugar coma first.
I'm the favorite. It might be fun.
it's totally casual. I'm sure Rory would love it.
okay, sure. What time?
7: 00 sound good? - Sounds fine.
let me give you our address. - That's okay. I know where you live.
right. Of course you do. So see you tonight.
Bye.
so? - Got it.
score! I'm glad it was in, but what kind of world do we live in...
where no one has rented Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory?
well, we rented it. - Thank God for us.
I invited your friend over to watch it with us.
what friend? - Dean.
what?
I told him what we were doing tonight, and he was totally into it.
so... Why are you looking at me like that?
you invited Dean to our house? - Yes.
are you crazy? - Why are you mad?
we haven't even been out on a date by ourselves yet.
my first date with Dean is gonna be with my mother? What is wrong with you?
I'm sorry. I thought you would be happy about this.
in what universe would I be happy?
this isn't Amish country. Girls and boys usually date alone.
I thought of it more as a hanging out kind of session.
I don't want our first hanging out session to be with my mother.
stop saying mother like that. - Like what?
like there's supposed to be another word after it.
I can't believe you did this. I'm so humiliated.
you're totally overreacting.
I invited him to a movie and pizza, not to Niagara Falls.
he's the boy that I like.
I know. I looked for one that you hated. But it was really short notice.
now he's forced to come over, sit with me and my mother,
and eat crap and watch a movie?
I just invited a friend of yours to hang out.
what's the big deal? What if Lane had done it?
you're not Lane. You're my mother.
you inviting him over is like Grandma inviting a guy you liked over.
you're comparing me to my mother? - No. I just...
I'm Emily Gilmore now? My, how the mighty have fallen.
I didn't mean that.
I wasn't trying to humiliate you. - I know.
if I was Emily Gilmore, I'd be trying to humiliate you.
I just... - Look, I'm sorry, okay? I screwed up.
I was trying to...
look, I'll go. I'll uninvite him.
I'll tell him it's canceled because I just found out that I'm my mother.
and I have to go into intensive therapy. - No, you can't uninvite him.
he'll think I wigged out.
then I'll just disappear, and you guys can be alone.
and have it look like my mom arranged a date for me? No!
what do we do?
he has to come.
it won't be so bad, okay? Just pizza, and a movie, and hanging out.
I promise you won't feel like your mother is there.
okay.
you might, however, feel like my mother is there.
this is good. Add some cold cream, and some curlers,
and let him know what he'll be coming home to every night.
this was supposed to be a simple night.
watch movie, eat junk, go to bed feeling sick.
end of story.
now I'm supposed to look pretty and girly, which is completely impossible,
because I'm gross, and I have nothing to wear.
do you want some help? - No.
Yes. - Okay.
let's see. This and...
all right, well...
this says, "Hello, I'm hip and cute, but also relaxed."
since this is something I just threw on, even though it looks fantastic on me.
how did you do that? - What?
I've been staring at that top for 20 minutes. It was just a top.
you walk in, and in three seconds it's an outfit.
it comes from years of experiencing fashion brain freeze like the one you had.
how do you do it? - What?
this whole guy thing?
I've watched you when you talk to a man.
you have a comeback for everything. You make him laugh.
you smile right. - I smile right?
then you do the hair flip. - Oh, twirl. It's a hair twirl.
then you walk away. And he just stands there, amazed,
like he can't believe what happened.
that's because I just stole his wallet. - I'll never be able to do that.
trig, I can do. But boys and dating, forget it.
I'm a total spaz.
listen.
the talking part, you just get used to. The hair twirl, I can teach you.
and the leaving-him-amazed part...
with your brain and killer blue eyes, I'm not worried. You'll do fine.
just give yourself a little time to get there.
is half an hour enough? - Plenty.
come on. Dab on some lip gloss, clear but fruity. Maybe a little mascara.
wear your hair down, and your attitude high.
you're like a crazy Elsa Klensch.
Oh, thank you. Come on, now, hustle. We got a man coming over.
what time did you tell him to get here? - 7: 00.
maybe something happened. Maybe he's not coming.
maybe he's just late, Miss German Train.
what?
...is one of my favorite towns. There used to be a club there...
what was it called, baby? - Mister Kelly's.
Yeah, Mister Kelly's. You ever go there?
they've got Dean. - Wait here.
so, Dean, you like jazz? - He sure does.
it's all we ever hear about, right? Jazz.
Hey, sugar. We were just getting to know your young man here.
Yeah, I see that.
Dean, would you mind going inside and helping Rory out?
there's a struggle with a jar lid that I think she's about to lose.
sure, yeah. - It was nice talking to you, Dean.
Yeah, you, too.
stay cool, kid. - I will.
Oh, is he cute! - Yeah.
and that Chuck Heston chin of his!
is he Rory's boyfriend? - No, they're just friends.
that's not what I heard.
kissing at the market gives a whole new meaning to Tasting Day.
okay. I got to get back inside and shower. I'll talk to you guys later.
have a good evening.
and don't forget to invite us to the wedding.
Oh, won't their kids be gorgeous!
Oh, God, I hope not.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got here, like, a half hour ago. - We believe you.
we'd believe you if you said you got here three hours ago.
so, Dean, how do you like it here in Stars Hollow?
I like it.
it's quiet, but nice.
I like all the trees everywhere. - Yeah, the trees here are something.
when Rory was little, she found out that one was called a weeping willow.
and so she spent hours trying to cheer it up.
you know, like telling it jokes and...
no, I'm sorry. That was me.
would you like a tour of the house? - Okay.
so, this is the living room, where we do our living.
upstairs is my room and the good bathroom.
the kitchen is right through here.
you ever heard a fridge yodel before?
thank you. - You're welcome.
well, you have your basics.
microwave for popcorn, stove for storing shoes,
refrigerator, which is completely worthless.
interesting.
I'll get that. Rory, you take over as tour guide.
make sure and show him the emergency exits.
that's my mom. - She's got energy.
Yeah, well, she's 90% water, 10% caffeine.
so, what's in there? - That's my room.
Really? Can I see it?
Wow! Very clean.
it sucks that they use Pink Moon in a Volkswagen commercial.
Oh, I know.
so, are you gonna come in? - Oh, no, I've seen it.
you look like you're glued to the door there.
no, I'm just observing my room from a new perspective.
I hardly ever stand here. It's really making me re-think my throw pillows.
would you like me to get out of here? - No, I'm fine with you looking around.
nice chicken. - Or, you know, at least I was.
we do not need dessert, Sookie. - Everybody needs dessert.
so, where is Rory? - With Dean.
Oh, that's right. Dean is here.
Yeah, right. You need to go now.
please. I just want one little peek. - No.
okay, fine. So, how are you? How are you doing?
Sookie. - I'm concerned.
you're stalling. - Am I?
Hey, Lorelai. - Hey, Joe. What do I owe you?
$15 even. - Okay.
how you doing? - Awesome.
what did you get on your pizza?
did you ask for extra sauce? I always ask for extra sauce.
Sookie, she's already freaked out that I invited him here.
if she thinks I'm parading him in front of my friends, she'll kill me.
but, I just... - Death, bloody and slow, okay?
mom, is that the pizza? - Yeah.
okay, bye. Now go. - I just wanted...
no. Bye. See you.
so, are you hungry? - Starving.
Where's the pizza? - The pizza's...
just bringing in the pizza.
Hi, I'm Sookie. I'm a friend of LorelaI's.
nice to meet you, Dean. Not that I knew you were Dean.
but you look like a Dean. Doesn't he look like a Dean?
Yeah, of all the people in this room, he looks most like a Dean.
Bye, Sookie.
have fun. Okay.
here, I'll take that.
Oh, thanks. Great. The coffee table's fine.
I did not invite her.
why don't you set up a camera, broadcast it over the Internet?
because I don't think that big.
thank God there's good pizza here.
Yeah. We didn't know what kind you liked, so we just got everything.
everything is fine.
good. Well, while it's hot.
now, remember, no messing about. No touching, no tasting...
who needs more? - I do.
wow, you can eat. - Yes, I can.
that's bad, isn't it?
no. Most girls don't eat. It's good you eat.
I'm all for it.
let's talk about something besides my eating habits.
my mom has a thing for the Oompa Loompas.
I don't think finding them amusing constitutes a thing.
no, but having a recurring dream about marrying one does.
don't get me started on your Prince Charming crush, okay?
at least my obsessions are live. You have a thing for a cartoon.
prince Charming, huh? - It was a long time ago.
not the Cinderella one, the Sleeping Beauty one.
cause he could dance. - Yeah.
I've got sisters.
so, come on, Dean, tell us some of your embarrassing secrets.
well, I have no embarrassing secrets.
Oh, please.
I bet I know one. - What?
the theme from Ice Castles makes you cry.
that's a good one. - That's not true.
I've got one.
at the end of The Way We Were, you wanted Robert Redford...
to dump his wife and kid for Barbra Streisand.
I've never seen The Way We Were. - Are you kidding?
what are you waiting for? Heartache, laughter...
communism. - All in one neat package.
I'll have to experience that sometime.
next movie night. - It's a plan.
I'm gonna get the popcorn. - Bring the spray cheese.
when does the outsider get to suggest a movie for movie night?
it depends. What movie are you thinking of?
I don't know, Boogie Nights, maybe.
you'll never get it past Lorelai. - Not a Marky Mark fan?
she had a bad reaction to Magnolia.
she sat there screaming for three hours, "I want my life back"!
then we got kicked out of the theater. It was actually an entertaining day.
yeah? - Yeah.
I guess I'll have to come up with a different movie then.
I guess you will.
are they chocolate eggs?
that Oompa Loompa right there.
you know when he's dancing...
...these are the geese that lay the golden eggs.
as you can see, they're larger than ordinary geese.
as a matter of fact, they're quadruple-sized geese...
which produce octuple-sized eggs...
thank you.
but Easter's over!
they don't know that.
Hey, Daddy, I want a golden goose. - Here we go again.
all right, sweetheart. Daddy'll get you a golden goose...
as soon as we get home. - No, I want one of those!
Wonka, how much do you want for the golden goose?
they're not for sale...
I'll be right back.
I want one...
mom.
what? - What are you doing in here?
trying to find a bathing suit for my bust size.
get back in there.
Why? What happened? Did the bag boy try something?
he's sitting there, he's watching the movie, he's perfect,
and he smells really good. - What?
he smells really good, and he looks amazing...
and I am stupid! I said, "Thank you.
you said "thank you"? - When he kissed me.
he kissed you again?
what, is he just out of prison or something?
no, not now. Yesterday, at the store.
all right. Strike the prison comment.
he kissed you and you said "thank you"? - Yes.
that was very polite.
no, it was stupid. And I don't know what I'm doing.
what kind of chaperon are you, sitting in the kitchen?
I'm not trying to be a chaperon. I'm a girlfriend.
well, switch gears because I'm freaking out here!
you really like him, don't you?
Yeah. - Okay, then. Just calm down.
I don't want to do or say anything else that's gonna be remotely moronic.
I'm afraid once your heart is involved it all comes out in moron.
just please come back in. - Okay. Let's go, then.
we can't go back in together. That would be too obvious.
right. Okay, I'll go in first, and you go to the bathroom.
okay, good. Tell him I had to wash my face.
Yes. Because of all the sugar you ate. - Yes, very good.
Hi. I'm back.
Rory went to wash her face. - Oh, okay.
...swifter than eagles, stronger than lions...
Hey, Grandpa, what was that we just went through?
I don't know exactly how to say this,
but this is a very different kind of household you walked into tonight.
Yeah, I know.
see, Rory is my daughter.
here comes the talk. - How about I talk, you listen?
Rory is a smart kid. She's never been much for guys.
the fact that she likes you means a lot.
I don't believe she'd waste her time with some loser.
but you're watching me.
sweetheart, the whole town is watching you.
that girl in there is beloved around here.
you hurt her, there's not a safe place within a hundred miles for you to hide.
this is a very small, weird place you moved to.
I've noticed.
so, just know all eyes are on you.
anything else?
she's not going on your motorcycle. - I don't have a motorcycle.
she's not going on your motorcycle. - Fine. She won't go on my motorcycle.
curfew will be enforced. You will not detract from her schoolwork.
you'll start handling those lemons better.
what? - Don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.
I reserve the right to change, alter, tweak, or add to the list of rules at any time...
without any written notice. Am I clear?
you're clear.
good. - My turn to speak?
fine. Go ahead.
you can lay on all the rules you want.
you can have the whole town spy on me...
and stare at me, and chase me through the streets.
I like the "chase you through the streets" idea.
I just want you to know that I'm not going anywhere.
it's gonna be a short chase then, isn't it? - I need you not to hate me.
if you hate me, then I don't have a shot in hell with Rory.
Rory has her own mind. - But you're her best friend.
what you think means everything to her, and you know that.
I want to like you, because Rory likes you.
but you don't. - I want to.
and I usually get what I want.
fair enough.
she's taking a long time on her face.
Yeah, well, Rory is a perfectionist.
let's do it again, Mr. Wonka.
tell your mom thanks for inviting me.
I'm sorry if this was totally weird.
with my mom inviting you over... - No. It was good, really.
Really? - Yeah.
thank you.
so, that went well.
Yeah, not bad.
did I humiliate you?
I don't know. What did you say to him when I went to the bathroom?
that you're pretty.
liar. - Yeah, well...
I'm gonna go to bed. - Okay.
mom, what's the matter? - Nothing.
Yes, there is. Come on. Tell me.
nothing.
I really wanted you to tell me about that kiss.
I'm so sorry. I really wanted to, I swear.
I just got scared and... - I know. I'm not mad.
I just wanted to hear about it. That's all.
it's no big deal. It's okay. I'm fine.
it's one too many Caramello bars. I'm sorry.
you have school, I have work. So time for bed.
okay. Good night. - Okay. Good night, hon.
mom?
I know this is lame and totally after the fact, but...
start at the beginning. And you leave anything out, you die.
where were you? - I was in the aisle where the ant spray is.
this town meeting will come to order.
no one is listening to me. - Taylor, calm down.
I can't calm down. I'm being persecuted.
I promised that we'd hear you. - We've been hearing you for 20 minutes.
excuse me, but some of us have businesses to run...
that don't involve peddling drug paraphernalia to kids.
it was a lava lamp, Taylor.
there is no use for a lava lamp unless you're on drugs.
for crying out loud.
now, we've already agreed to look into your accusation but to just...
What'd I miss?
Taylor Doose wants the no-parking zone in front of his store removed.
he says his customers are being unfairly ticketed.
no, he just wants to park there all day. - Genius.
I have been mayor of this fine town for a long time.
I tend to think of all of you as my children.
unfortunately, sometimes children have to be disciplined.
now, I'm gonna say something, and I'm only gonna say it once.
we have leash laws, people.
daddy's getting angry.
rover will not leash himself. - Good point.
I would like to now move on to something of even greater importance.
as you all know, this coming Friday...
is the anniversary of the legendary Battle of Stars Hollow.
Where's Luke? - There.
Patty will be circulating a sign-up sheet...
for those of you who would like to participate...
in the reenactment of the aforesaid battle.
he's turning red.
all right.
it was a frigid November night some 224 years ago...
he's shifting in his seat.
...Hollow Militia stood in wait for the redcoats.
he's adjusting the cap.
tired and hungry, 12 proud men took their positions in the town square.
he's fighting the urge.
...and imminent death in their valiant efforts...
for God's sake, do we have to go through this every damn year?
Yes! - And the urge wins by a long shot.
I thought we were here to discuss town issues.
this is a town issue.
excuse me, who's talking? - It's me, Harry. Luke.
you've known me since I was five years old.
Luke, yes. Sit down.
now, as I was saying: "12 heroic men...
assembled with guns drawn, ready to meet their maker...
what are you talking about? Twelve guys stood in a row all night.
...waiting for the redcoats... - Who never showed!
now, just...
twelve guys stood in a row waiting for an enemy that never showed.
they got stood up. They should've been wearing prom dresses.
I've had just about enough of this. - Sit down, Taylor!
menace. - Suck up.
$5, someone ends up in a headlock. - You're on.
have any of you considered the fact that you're glorifying a war we fought...
so we could keep land that we stole?
if you don't like it here in America,
why don't you go stand in line for toilet paper in the USSR?
there is no more USSR, Harry.
a sense of community is so important, isn't it?
it's what made our country great.
...if you're so interested in facts.
Lorelai, it's Max. Medina, Max Medina.
and once again we miss each other.
it's now 2.：00 in the afternoon on Thursday...
and I'm in my office grading a paper entitled.;
Emily Dickinson, Get a Life.
anyhow, as I sit here losing my faith in mankind...
I wonder if we're ever gonna actually go on that date...
we talked about many moons ago.
I teach a night class in Stamford twice a week...
and when I pass that Stars Hollow sign on the turnpike, I think;
out there is a beautiful woman that I someday hope to spend time with.
anyhow, I'm just thinking about you.
I don't know, maybe next week we can find some time.
Bye, Lorelai Gilmore.
you knew that. Okay, bye.
Lorelai, it's Max Medina, Max Medina.
mom? - And once again we miss each other.
sorry. - What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep. - It's freezing in here.
wait. Close your eyes and breathe.
I smell snow.
it's that time of year. - Can't you smell it?
you know, it's like dogs and high-pitched noises.
I think it's something only you can smell.
I love snow. - Really? I had no idea.
everything's magical when it snows. Everything looks pretty.
the clothes are great: Coats, scarves, gloves, hats.
thermal underwear, wool socks, earflaps.
do you know the best things in my life have happened when it snowed?
why, yes, I do.
my best birthday. - Your first kiss.
your first steps. They all happened when it snowed.
feet.
I feel good. Tingly. - That's called frostbite.
you are mocking your mother, the woman who birthed you.
I'm sorry. - During a snowstorm, might I add.
so how soon is it supposed to hit?
tomorrow. Definitely tomorrow.
okay, then tomorrow it is. - What?
you, me, doughnuts, coffee, standing out in a snowstorm.
at midnight? - At midnight.
you are my favorite daughter.
how many times are you gonna listen to that?
till it stops being sexy.
stop. That's my teacher you're talking about.
I have to respect him.
okay, if it makes you feel any better...
while he's being sexy, he's also being grammatically correct.
better. Thank you.
sorry, I woke you up.
it's okay. It's all fodder for the tell-all.
good night.
Lorelai, it's Max Medina, Max Medina.
how is it out there?
it is cold and gray, like a fat, dead pigeon.
we'll pull out the sleds. People might want to sled.
we'll need the parkas.
for what? - In case anyone wants to hike.
you know not everyone finds the idea of being pelted with frozen water appealing.
I know, and how sad for them.
the sensation of getting lost in a blizzard...
of freezing to death in the woods, eating your friend's buttocks to stay alive...
that is lost on many people.
I am telling you, five minutes in a snowball fight...
we could knock that stick right out of your butt.
okay, how does this sound?
Maple-sugar snowflakes on all the pillows?
that sounds wonderful!
make them in the shape of a buttock to get people used to them.
is that a real suggestion? - Sookie, please, who is speaking?
Michel, right, okay. Snowflakes it is.
I just can't believe it.
I mean, I sat next to him in practice for months...
and then one day I look over, and it's Rich.
where is my chemistry book? I had it at your house yesterday.
Rory, focus, please.
I'm sorry. I just can't find my book. - Hey, babe.
sergeant Pepper. - Mom, do you know where my...
scary chemistry book is? Behind the desk.
thank God.
so, is Sookie in the kitchen? - And there she'll stay.
okay. So, where were we? - I just met my soul mate.
right. Rich Bloomenfeld.
does he still wear the Star Trek shirt?
remember, you do not take your eyes off this for a minute.
cause the second you do, it will boil, and then it's ruined.
so just stand there and stare at it, okay?
Hey, Sookie. - Hey, kitty-cats.
cinnamon buns are over there.
do you have any Rocky Road cookies you made yesterday?
I can scrounge some up.
lane, you need a bag? - No, thank you.
are you staring? - I'm staring.
thank you.
so, anyhow, Rich has this amazing hair.
Really? - Oh, my God. It's so perfect.
it's thick, but it's not too thick, and it's got really good natural wave.
so he probably uses way less product than most guys.
always a plus.
what time is it? - I don't know.
I have to get to the bus stop. Dean's meeting me there.
I'm trying to talk to you. - I know. We'll talk on the way.
here you go. - Thank you, Sookie.
a locksmith's coming to the house today, like 5: 00, and it could take long.
so tell Grandma and Grandpa I'll be late,
and that I'm having Satan's baby? You pick the order.
I'll relay the time message but I'm leaving the rest to you.
you hate Rocky Road cookies. - I do not.
I'm sorry. That must be my other daughter, Shmory.
we're leaving now. - Wait a minute.
I know who likes Rocky Road cookies.
who? - They're for Dean.
she's bringing baked goods to a boy. Wow, serious.
here, Dean, these cookies are for you, because you're keen.
stop. - Rory's in love!
we can stop. She's gone now. - But it's fun.
you're on your own.
I just can't believe it.
I've known him since the sixth grade, but suddenly he's different.
he's not gangly anymore. You remember how gangly he was?
I'm sorry. What?
you're not listening to me. - I am. I'm sorry.
I just couldn't find my bookmark. Okay, go ahead.
here are the problems facing the whole Bloomenfeld-Kim situation.
one: Hyphenation would be a pain.
two: He's my band partner. Romance would be completely awkward.
three: He's never even looked at me like I'm a girl or something resembling one.
four: There's no way I could convince my parents he was Korean.
but I can't help it. I'm obsessed.
did I tell you about his hair? - It's on his head, right?
nice hat.
here. - How'd you like it?
I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
you liked it. You liked Jane Austen. I knew you would.
lane, Dean likes Jane Austen. - Who would've thought?
I told him he would, but he was all:
forget Jane Austen. Read Hunter Thompson.
you do have to read Hunter Thompson.
not as much as you needed to read Jane Austen.
what's that? - Just some cookies.
rocky Road. - Yeah.
wow, she brings me cookies. How can I repay her?
how about Charlotte Bronte? - How about something else?
that's good, too.
okay, I gotta go. I'm gonna be late for homeroom.
I have that perfect-attendance certificate in my sights.
see you later. - Yeah, see you.
ladies and gentlemen, we have flakes.
flakes have been sighted. Flakeage, if you will, has begun.
Michel, it's the first snowfall of the season.
it's very lucky. Make a wish. - Get away from me.
you're not supposed to say it out loud.
independence Inn. - The world changes when it snows.
it gets quiet. Everything softens.
it's your mother. - And then the rain comes.
Hi, Mom.
have you seen the news? - Ever?
a bad storm's heading your way. It's already hit us here.
I'll get the ark, you get the animals.
I just sent Lance to pick up Rory at school.
the roads are terrible. Black ice everywhere.
it's just a mess out there. I hate this kind of weather.
what time will you get here?
I don't know, let's see.
black ice, treacherous roads. I'll wear my red-white-and-blue leotard,
grab my golden lasso, and fly the invisible plane.
you're not coming.
if it's as bad as you say it is, I don't see how I'd come.
I guess it'll just be the three of us then. - I guess so.
you know, Rory should probably spend the night tonight also.
okay. - And if it's still bad tomorrow...
why don't you see what the weather does...
before filling out a change-of-address card for her.
Rory's here. - Put her on a sec.
Rory, it's your mother.
things bad out there? - It's crazy.
there's snow coming down everywhere...
and saddle shoes are not the best all-weather footwear.
you fell. - Twice.
Yikes. I'm sorry. - So, are you coming over tonight?
no, I'm pretty much stuck in the Hollow tonight.
bummer. We can take our snow walk tomorrow night?
Absolutely.
tell Grandma you arrived there not a member of the Junior League.
I'd like you to leave there the same way.
call if you get lonely. - I will. Bye.
stop this before somebody drives through town...
and thinks the local mental institution has bad padlocks.
you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Your father was a reenactor.
Yes, and I thought he was crazy also.
who's stepping on my musket? - That'd be me.
well, stop it.
there goes the fire chief, the police chief...
and the one paramedic with a valid license. I feel safe. Don't you?
look at them. All relatively intelligent men...
but there they are, dressed up in costumes...
standing out in a snowstorm, and for what?
because it's tradition.
tradition is a trap allowing people to stick their head in the sand.
everything in the past was so quaint, so charming.
times were simpler. Kids didn't have sex.
neighbors knew each other. It's a freaking fairy tale.
things sucked then, too. It sucked without indoor plumbing.
I think some traditions are nice.
birthdays, holidays...
taking a walk in the first snow of the season.
I didn't get the Hallmark card for that one.
when I was five, I had a really bad ear infection...
and I had been home in bed for a week, and I was very sad.
so I wished really hard that something wonderful would happen to me.
I woke up the next morning, and it had snowed.
and I was sure that some fairy godmother had done it just for me.
it was my little present.
your parents didn't explain the concept of weather?
I am making a point, Mouthy McGee. Of course, many years later...
I realized that, logically, the snow was not there for me personally.
but still, when it snows, something inside me says:
"hey, that's your present." I don't think it'll ever change.
my father used to be one of those guys. - Yeah?
Yeah, he even had his own musket. - Really?
never had to rent it.
Where's the musket now? - He was buried with it.
Yeah, he loved that musket.
that's nice, in a disturbing sort of way.
come on in. I'll get you some coffee.
no, thanks.
I'm gonna walk around. Enjoy my present a little.
people, please get into formation.
hats on and instruments in place.
do not, I repeat...
do not actually put instruments to your mouths...
until we are inside.
remember what happened to the flautist last year.
I smell snow.
what's up, Teacher? - What are you doing here?
I live here. What are you doing here?
I was on my way back from Stamford. My car decided to stop.
here? - Yes.
in my town? - Yes.
good car.
it's nice to see you. - You, too.
you know, a minute ago I was really angry about something...
and now I just can't remember what it was.
that's snow for you. - I guess so.
so, this is quite a predicament you're in.
stranded here in a strange town with no one you know.
wait.
Where's Rory tonight? - She's in Hartford with her grandparents.
that must be nice. - Whatever you say.
so Rory's in Hartford? - Yes.
and I'm in Stars Hollow. - Correct.
and you're... - Thinking where I should take you.
no, where I should take you.
this is my town. You know nothing around here.
no, but I was the one who asked you out initially...
so therefore I am still obligated to do the taking.
but I was the one who did the canceling after you did the asking.
therefore you forfeit your taking rights to me, the canceller.
so we're actually gonna do this? - Yes, we are.
let me just give this guy my keys, and then we'll go.
great. - "Great" is an understatement.
I just don't understand why you waited so late to call.
are you sure?
fine. All right. Yes, goodbye.
I don't know what I'm gonna do now.
what's the problem, Emily?
the problem is that apparently Florence cannot get here because of the storm.
our cook.
we'll just have to go out, then.
please, Richard, pay attention. We can't go out. It's miserable out there.
we'll figure something out.
what? What will we figure out?
I don't know, but... - I hate the damn snow.
Emily, calm down. - This is a serious problem.
these Friday dinners are the only proper food that child eats all week.
Rory, are you in any way malnourished...
or in need of some international relief organization to recruit a celebrity...
to raise money on your account?
I'm good. - She's good, Emily.
your sense of humor rears its ugly head at the oddest of times, Richard.
I'm not the mastermind behind some great scheme to spoil your dinner plans,
and I don't care to be treated as such.
so you're fine with having no dinner tonight, is that it?
I certainly am not. - How about I check the fridge?
I'm sure there's something in there we could whip up.
whip up? - Yeah, come on.
it'll be fun, I promise.
come on, Mr. We'Il-figure-it-out.
nothing. - Not a blessed thing.
there's frozen pizza.
how did that get there? - Maybe you bought it and forgot.
I've never bought frozen pizza. It must belong to Anna.
the maid. - Yes.
got one!
what are you doing? - I'm gonna make it.
you're not serious. - That hardly looks like dinner.
I agree. Rory, that's food you eat at a carnival or in a Turkish prison.
I promise you'll love it.
but... - Listen, just leave it up to me.
you guys go back to the living room, and I'll call you when it's ready.
grandma? - Yes?
what are the odds you'd know where a cookie sheet would be?
I'd say very slim. - Never mind. I'll find it.
very slim? Thank you for that.
thank you. Hold that.
Thanks.
God, it's a beautiful night. - Yes, it is.
so, tell me something about yourself. - Like what?
have you ever been married? - Nope.
ever been close? - Once.
And? - She's in Thailand.
sex trade? - Bank of America.
it's usually one or the other.
she went there on business. She did well. She never came back.
sad. - It was, at the time.
but if it was meant to be... - He believes in fate.
fate, poetry, love. They all go together, don't they?
Yes, they do.
how about you? - I've never been married.
ever been close? - Rory's dad proposed.
what happened? - The bell rang. I was late for chem lab.
you ever sorry that you didn't?
no, we were so young and my life would've been completely different.
you know, I wouldn't live here. I wouldn't work here.
I wouldn't be walking here with you.
where are we going? - You'll see.
are we gonna get there before we freeze?
what kind of fun would it be if I told you the answer?
you're crazy. - Very possible.
and I'm following you. - Yes, you are.
so possibly I'm crazier then you are. - Again, very possible.
a match made in heaven. - Or in Bellevue.
it must be fate.
this is getting ridiculous, Aaron.
I will not continue to have these conversations with a child.
Yes, he is a child.
when he's worked 30 years at the company, he won't be a child.
until then, I don't care what his opinions are.
aaron, are you listening to me?
good, because I'm hanging up on you now,
and I wanted to make sure that you heard it.
what a moron.
Hello, Rory?
where are you? - I'm at my grandparents'.
what are you doing at my house?
like you care. - What are you talking about?
you're never around when I need you.
you know I have to go to my grandparents' on Fridays.
I know. You go to your grandparents'. You go to Chilton.
you have to meet Dean. He needs his cookies. "I can't find my books."
what are you taking about?
why have a best friend when she's never around...
never listens, has no interest in the fact that you're in love...
or that you touched his hair? - You touched whose hair?
why would you touch Rich Bloomenfeld's hair?
Why? That's a good question. I don't know why.
why would a sane person do a thing like that? Maybe I'm not sane.
maybe I'm going through some sort of phase.
maybe I really needed someone to talk to about this, and you weren't there.
lane, come on.
you're always at school, or you're talking about school,
or you're with Dean.
you have everything now, and I have nothing...
except for 2, 000 Korean Bibles and a potential "F" in jazz band.
I'm sorry.
don't be sorry. Be here.
lane? Are you there?
there you are. - I think the phones went dead.
it's probably just this horrible storm.
you must come downstairs immediately. - What's wrong?
the stove is buzzing. - It's just the timer, Grandma.
I know it's the timer. I don't know where it's located, or how to turn it off.
but I really need to call Lane back.
you can do nothing. The phones will eventually come back.
please come downstairs and help me stop the buzzing.
Emily, for heaven's sake, get down here.
okay, let's go.
so, the fiesta burger...
very interesting.
very spicy? - Oh, yeah.
how's your tongue? - Much better, thank you.
are you scared yet? - Not yet.
are you scared yet? - I'm still good.
are you scared yet?
you're very annoying in a movie. - I know.
I think it's very important that you know my faults...
as well as my many attributes.
very thoughtful of you. - It is, isn't it?
because, as you know...
you can get carried away by your many attributes...
and suddenly find yourself thinking, "Oh, my God!
this woman is absolutely perfect."
we wouldn't want that, now, would we?
no, we wouldn't.
you want to eat it before it gets cold.
how is it? - Not cold.
it's quite tasty.
Emily, we should have this more often. - What?
perhaps instead of that horrible salmon that keeps showing up.
that salmon is a fine delicacy.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.
try it again, Grandma. It's probably cooler now.
no, thank you. I'm fine. - You know what?
it's really good if you add some extra Parmesan to it.
this is Mom's special trick.
frozen pizza is a staple at our house.
mom's become a major doctoring genius. She'll put anything on it.
one time Sookie came and brought us some foie gras,
and mom stuck it on a pizza. - How was it?
pretty good once we took the foie gras off.
okay, that's good.
try it. Please?
if you want to get really crazy, you can pick it up.
well, all right.
here goes nothing.
that's wonderful! - See?
Rory, pass me that cheese.
trust me.
it makes all the difference.
I'll be right back.
I found this in Mom's room.
what's that? - Pictures.
Oh, my goodness, I haven't seen that in years.
Oh, my gosh.
look at this.
that's one fluffy white dress.
there were 12 petticoats underneath it.
we got it in London, remember, Richard?
she looks like a little princess.
I believe about two minutes after that picture was taken...
her Highness dumped a glass of grape juice over it.
look, Emily, it's Hopey. - Hopey?
my younger sister.
have I ever seen her? I don't remember her.
she lives in Paris. Our great expatriate.
Hopey, look at you. I haven't seen her in such a long time.
maybe we should take a trip this year. - That would be nice.
maybe Rory could go with us. - I'll start packing tomorrow.
is that you guys? - Yes, it is.
that is our wedding picture. - That's an amazing dress.
it should've been. My mother had three seamstresses working round the clock.
you still have it? - It's upstairs packed away somewhere.
I'll save it for you if you like.
Rory's too young to be thinking about things like that.
every young girl thinks about her wedding. I know I did.
I knew when I was 12 that I wanted lilies and orchids...
with a silver bow wrapped around them for my bouquet.
you also knew that you wanted to marry Errol Flynn.
grandma had a thing for the pirate guy? - I did not.
she was mad about him.
she tried to get me to grow one of those mustaches.
you're kidding. - Richard, stop.
she wanted me to swing from a chandelier.
now you're just being silly.
luckily, I was on the fencing team at college...
or I would have married Lucinda Lester by now.
actually, Lucinda Lester looked a lot like Errol Flynn.
I should have married her. It would have been very modern of me.
mom looks really beautiful here.
Yes, she does. - What was the occasion?
who would like some coffee?
that was her debutante gown for her coming-out party.
mom had a coming-out party? - No, she didn't.
Yes, well, things happen, don't they?
if you'll excuse me, I have some business calls to make.
I'll go get that coffee.
here. - What is this?
I brought you coffee. - No, thank you.
Harry, you're freezing. Take the damn coffee.
when our forefathers stood out here many moons ago, they didn't have any coffee.
- How do you know?
do you have written documentation about what beverages...
they did or did not have on that long, historic night of standing?
this is still a joke to you, young man.
I don't choose to be a joke. We don't need your coffee.
Harry, please. Take the coffee.
my father would have taken the coffee.
well, all right, then. Thank you.
Andrew? - Thank you, Luke.
Kirk? - You got any herbal tea?
not on me, but I can get some.
with a squeeze of lemon. - Okay.
I could really go for some cocoa.
that sounds good. - Cocoa for me, too.
okay, hang on a minute. One herbal tea...
and two cocoas.
Yeah, that part was a little slow. - Slow?
but it picked up pretty soon after that, don't you think?
so this is it, my house. - Nice.
thank you.
good porch.
nice windows.
front door.
which opens, I assume. - Yeah.
something wrong? - No, nothing's wrong.
are you sure? - Yeah, I...
I was so excited about the snow, and about seeing you...
thank you. ...that I didn't really think this thing out.
and I usually think this kind of thing out.
so I'm just thinking this thing out. - What thing?
inviting a man over to my house. - Okay.
see, I have really strict rules about dating.
I keep my personal life totally separate from my life with Rory.
I never want her to feel unsettled...
or like her life could just shift at any moment.
I totally understand.
and she comes first, and this her house, too.
I understand. This is something that you don't do often.
ever. - Ever?
never. - I see.
I mean, I've dated.
and, you know, dated.
but I've just never dated...
here, in our house.
what if I promised you that if you let me in...
all I'm expecting is a cup of coffee? That's it.
nothing weird or funny.
unless you're into weird and funny, 'cause I could do weird and funny.
I've been enjoying the hell out of myself tonight...
and I think you are, too. - I am.
so, it's snowing...
cold, and your daughter is elsewhere. - I know.
the whole night's been a weird kismet of events.
it's that fate guy again. - At some point in your life...
you have to decide that some guy is worth opening that front door for.
I am just volunteering.
would you like some coffee?
how strong do you like your coffee? 'Cause I've built up such a tolerance to it...
I make it too intense for most people.
I lived through the fiesta burger. Don't hold back now.
can I help? - Yeah, you can fill up the pot.
I'm very good at that.
six cups sounds good? - Fine.
what are you gonna have?
you do know that was a leading question, right?
Really? How so?
how badly do you want that coffee? - Not badly.
such a good answer.
how many kids did you say you have?
one. Why?
we're just... What are you doing here? - I'm sorry. I was waiting for Rory.
I'll just go back into her room, and I won't come back out. I promise.
that's The Cure. I have to go back in there.
it's okay, I'll finish up the coffee.
I'll be back as fast as humanly possible. - Good.
I'm sorry I messed up your date.
you didn't mess up my date. What's going on?
I was waiting for Rory to get home. - Sweetie, Rory's stuck in Hartford tonight.
I didn't know. I'll just go.
do you want to talk?
I'm not Rory, but we do use the same blow dryer.
I did something really stupid today.
okay, what did you pierce? - Nothing.
I touched a boy's hair. - Okay.
a boy I really like. - So far I'm missing the stupid part.
I kind of did it without his permission. - Now we're getting somewhere.
I don't know what happened. I was just standing there.
and then he bends over, and his hair falls forward...
and suddenly it's like my hand has a life of its own.
sounds like your hand had help from your hormones.
God, I'm so humiliated. I can't ever go back to school.
I'll have to be home-schooled. My mother finally gets her way.
look at it from a different perspective.
you have so many years of screw-ups ahead of you.
view this as a trial run for really grown-up humiliation.
so not helping.
maybe you should be a hairdresser.
it's perfect. You can run your hands through anybody's hair...
and they'll pay you for it. - What am I going to do?
everyone at school's gonna be talking about me. I can't show my face.
everybody does stupid things in high school.
it's a requirement. - Not like this.
no, some people get pregnant.
talk about something really juicy for the gossip mill.
I forgot about that.
everybody screws up, Lane. That's what happens.
it's what you do with the screw-ups...
how you handle the experience... That's what you should judge yourself by.
I have a great life and an amazing kid.
and I took a detour.
I ended up someplace good.
tell me this.
how did his hair feel? Good as it looked?
better.
you're gonna be fine. I'm positive about that.
thank you. - You're welcome.
so who's the guy?
Rory's teacher.
he has nice hair.
everything okay in there? - It will be.
so, where did we leave off?
lane is gonna stay here tonight.
she had a really bad teen day,
and she needs to crash someplace sympathetic.
okay, I understand.
I swear to God, if this wasn't a major Judy Blume moment...
I would kick her cute little butt right out of here.
can you recommend a hotel that's really close to here?
why don't you just stay here tonight? Everybody else is.
I don't know. - Really, the couch is comfortable.
and there's pillows and blankets. The bathroom's through there.
and the kitchen has nothing in it...
but running water if you get thirsty.
and it's an awful night.
okay, if it's not a problem. - Not at all.
could I at least give you a kiss good-night?
only if you intend to live till morning.
good night.
what's up? - Nothing. What's up with you?
you have something to tell me.
boy, you're so smart. Right. Okay. Here we go.
I've got a boy in the house.
you what? - Nothing happened, I swear.
he slept on the couch. And you know him. - I do?
you like him. I don't know if that's relevant.
I just thought that I would throw that in there.
it's Mr. Medina. - I know.
my English teacher is on my couch.
it was the snow. You know how I get. It's like catnip.
I was walking. He was there. His car was broken. We had fiesta burgers.
it was the snow.
Rory, say something.
Rory, talk to me.
how do you feel? - I don't know.
take a guess: Angry, frustrated, nauseous?
weird. I feel weird.
has he been here all night? - Pretty much.
Oh, my God! Did he go into the bathroom?
I have stuff hanging in there!
you knew I was gonna date him. This isn't a total surprise.
Yes, I knew you were gonna date. I just didn't expect for him to be here...
at our house in the morning. - I know.
I don't even remember ever there being a man in our house.
Yeah, well, I kind of broke the rules.
God, why is this so weird for me?
because I should have told you first.
no.
because I should have talked to you before I did this.
because you're afraid he smooshed the couch pillows out of shape?
do you love him?
we had one date. It was a great date.
world Series level. But it was just a date.
honey, I promised myself a long time ago...
that I was gonna keep all this stuff separate from you.
and I want you to know that, that still stands, okay?
this was a one-time thing.
I'm not gonna start just bringing guys home.
this is not a trend.
you can, you know. - What?
bring guys home.
if you like someone, you should feel comfortable doing that.
I appreciate that. - I want you to be happy.
and I love you for that.
Plus, I know you're not a cat person...
so you will be alone if you don't find someone.
okay, look, someday I will bring somebody home.
but when I do, I just want to be sure it's the guy.
Mr. Medina's not the guy? - I don't know.
he might be.
but right now, it's just you and me.
and sometimes Lane.
I'm gonna go wake the man up.
your mom let me spend the night here.
I tried calling you all night, but the phones didn't work until morning.
that's okay. I understand. - Lane, I'm so sorry.
I've been the worst friend lately.
no, I just wigged out a little.
I get jealous sometimes.
I mean, you seem to have this really great life going...
and I don't really fit in there.
that's not true. You totally fit in.
yeah? - I'm talking Legos.
I hope so.
I will be better from now on, I promise.
twenty-four hours a day, at your disposal. - Dean will love that.
well, he'll have to. You came first.
that's right. I got dibs.
okay. I have to go home.
coffee at Luke's, 2: 00? - You're on.
your grandfather called and told me to tell you...
he's bringing you back something very special from Prague.
how amazing is it that he's going to Prague?
it's supposed to be lovely. Dramatic castles everywhere.
the cell that Vaclav Havel was held in is now a hostel.
you can stay there for $50 a night.
maybe on our trip to Europe we could go there and stay in his cell.
Absolutely. Then we should go to Turkey...
and stay in that place from Midnight Express.
Lorelai, what are you doing? - Getting rid of the avocado.
since when do you not like avocado?
since the day I said, 'Gross. What is this?' And you said, 'Avocado. '
I'm focusing on you now.
tell me all about the Chilton formal next week.
there's a formal?
how do you know about the formal? - Yeah, how do you know?
I read my Chilton newsletter. - Since when do you get a newsletter?
as a major contributor to Rory's education...
I figured I had the right to ask for a newsletter to be sent to me.
are you serious?
it's a good thing, too, since you don't read yours.
one of us should be up-to-date on the goings-on at her school.
mom, I read my newsletter.
you did? - That's right.
what was the picture on the cover?
it was a picture of a really rich kid in plaid.
it's a spotted owl. - In plaid.
the owls are endangered, and Chilton is taking donations to help them.
you gave a very nice one, in case you're interested.
don't be giving donations on Rory's behalf. I'll do that.
how can you when you don't read the newsletter?
I read it.
you didn't know they were taking donations.
it's a private school. They always take donations. I'll get them next time.
what about the owls? - They'll live.
apparently they won't, dear. That's why they need the donations.
you have a formal coming up? - Yeah, but I don't think I'm gonna go.
nonsense. Of course you're going.
mom, if Rory doesn't wanna go, she doesn't have to go.
I don't understand why she wouldn't wanna go.
I know you don't.
I'm gonna go get another Coke.
what did you say to her? - What are you talking about?
if she doesn't wanna go, it's because of something you said.
mom, I promise. All I ever said to her about dances...
is that you go, dance, have punch, eat, you take a picture...
and then you get auctioned off to a biker gang from Sausalito.
Lorelai, this is serious. - Mom, I said nothing, okay?
Rory's disdain of formals is totally her own.
let's just drop it, please.
fine. - Fine.
what's wrong with the tomato? - It was fraternizing with the enemy.
why didn't you mention the dance? - Because I'm not going.
but why aren't you going?
because I hate dances. - Good answer.
except you've never actually been to a dance.
so? - So you have nothing to compare it to.
no, but I can imagine it. - That's true.
however, not really, since you've never actually been to one.
you're basing all your dance opinions on one viewing of Sixteen Candles.
you should have a decent reason for hating something...
before you really decide you hate it.
trust me, I'll hate it. It'll be stuffy and boring, and the music will suck.
since none of the kids at school like me...
I'll be standing in the back listening to 98 Degrees...
watching Tristan and Paris argue over who gets to make me miserable first.
okay. Or it'll be all sparkly and exciting.
you'll be on the dance floor listening to Tom Waits...
with some great-looking guy staring at you so hard...
you don't realize that Paris and Tristan were just eaten by bears.
what guy?
maybe the guy who hangs out in our trees all day waiting for you.
Dean does not hang out in trees.
he bashed his head in a branch when I came out too quickly.
why do you care all of a sudden if I go? - I don't care if you go.
I just don't want you to miss on any experience because you're too afraid.
I'm afraid? Of what?
of asking Dean, of him saying no...
of going to a dance with a bunch of kids who haven't accepted you yet...
of dancing in public...
of finding out you should never be dancing in public.
okay, I get it.
listen, I know you are not Miss Party Girl, and I love you for that...
but sometimes I wonder.
do you not join in because you really don't want to...
or because you're too shy?
if you don't wanna go because you really don't wanna go...
and not because you are in any way afraid, then this is the last time I'll mention it.
I promise.
I don't have a dress.
I could make you one.
Really? - Yeah.
we could get some great shoes, and some new earrings.
we could get your hair done. - You won't think I'm an idiot?
it depends on what hairstyle you choose.
this dance could be great for you.
he's gonna say no.
why would he say no? - Why would he say yes?
there's no point in having a boyfriend if he won't go to the dance with you.
he's not my boyfriend.
Really? - No.
what is he then? - He's my gentleman caller.
okay, Blanche.
I don't know what he is, but he's not a boyfriend.
do you think he's my boyfriend?
you guys spend a lot of time not kissing other people, if it isn't that sort of thing.
girlfriend. - You.
boyfriend. - Him.
no, it sounds weird.
have you had the talk yet? - Yes, Lane. Babies come from the stork.
the other talk. - What other talk?
we've been dating a few weeks now. Where do we stand?
if another girl asks you out, do you feel free to go?
how do you know so much about this?
those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.
there he is.
I should do this later. - No. You have to do this now.
Why? - Because I have to go home soon...
and my mom threw out our TV when she caught me watching V. I. P.
so I'm bored, and I need some entertainment.
okay, here I go. - Good luck.
and remember to enunciate. I'm reading lips out here.
you're busy.
Yeah, I have to put the new green bean shipment on the shelves.
you wanna help? - Yeah, sure.
I love stacking beans.
okay, follow me.
do you work on Saturdays? I forget. - It depends.
sometimes I come in if I don't have any plans.
Why? - No reason.
there's this thing at my school on Saturday.
it's not really at my school, but it's kind of given by my school.
what is it?
it's this kind of thing where you go, and they play music...
and you get dressed up and dance, and then there's chicken.
chicken? - I don't know if there's chicken.
but at these kinds of things they often serve chicken...
because it's probably cheaper and people eat it.
so the logic behind the chicken choice really isn't that bad.
I'm lost. - It's a dance.
it's not like I'm dying to go or anything, but it is a new school...
and being a part of the social activities is really important at Chilton.
so are you asking me to go to a dance with you?
no.
Yes. I mean, if you wanted to go, I would go, too.
that would probably be good since it's your school.
right.
so do you wanna go?
honestly? - Yeah.
I've actually never gone to a dance before.
because they're lame?
Yeah, and it's not the way I ever wanted to spend my time.
I'm not a big joiner.
okay, fair enough. More beans, please.
you wanna go, don't you? - No, I don't.
I have no desire to go at all. I was just thinking out loud, that's all.
so what would I have to wear? - What?
to this dance. What would I have to wear?
anything you want. - Come on.
really, whatever you're comfortable in is fine.
some sort of pants would be good.
it's coat and tie. - Oh, man.
but you could probably get away with a coat and no tie.
okay.
Really? - Yeah.
thank you. - You're welcome.
extra thread. - God bless!
I've been working so hard to finish Rory's dress...
I haven't been able to get out.
you are walking funny. - I know.
Rory's dress made a pass at me, and I think I pulled something getting up.
here, sit. I got an ACE Bandage in my bag.
I'm not sure how we can wrap it, but maybe we can do something creative.
Sookie. - Let's see.
okay, I got Percodan, Vicodin, Darvocet, and...
take this one. It's a muscle-relaxer. Very mild, I promise.
Thanks. Maybe later.
I've gotta go. You sure you're gonna be okay?
I'm sure. - Okay.
Bye. - Bye.
Yeah. - You sound terrible.
I'm fine, Mom. I just stubbed my toe.
you should get rid of the clutter in your living room.
maybe. - That room is a hazard.
I've seen the light. Everything goes. What else you got?
I wanna talk about Rory's dance.
it's just killing me that she's not going.
this may seem frivolous and silly to her now, but believe me...
these are the kind of experiences you regret missing later.
okay.
regret can make you bitter. Do you want Rory to be bitter?
sort of.
Lorelai! - She could make some cash off of it.
become a crazy Oscar Levant kind of celebrity...
go on talk shows, heckle Regis.
I wish you would take this seriously.
mom, Rory is going to the dance.
she is?
that's wonderful! I'm thrilled.
I'm making her dress right now.
you're making her dress? - Yeah.
but why?
so she'll look really ugly and people will point and throw rocks.
why don't you let me buy her a dress?
mom, you were thrilled five seconds ago, remember?
you're not using the curtains, are you? - I gotta go.
just one more thing. Take a picture of Rory for me, please?
I will. - On the stairs.
and one by the front door.
and one as she's getting ready...
putting her hair up, putting her makeup on.
okay, do you want one when she's shaving her legs?
you know, one leg up...
in the tub, waving the disposable razor in the air?
this is a once-in-a-lifetime event.
you get to be there and I don't. - Oh, boy!
if I got enough pictures, I could at least...
line them up in chronological order and pretend I was there.
maybe bind them together, make a flipbook out of them.
would you like to come over on Saturday and see Rory go to the dance?
why, what a nice idea. I'd love that.
thank you. I'll see you at 7: 00.
Hi, Tristan. - Paris.
two, I assume? - You assume right.
so, who are you taking? - Why, are you free?
no, what am I thinking? You wouldn't be free this close to the dance.
here's your change.
is your hair shorter? - Yeah. Quarter of an inch.
Really? - I got it trimmed.
it looks good. - Thanks.
and she's reading again. How novel. - Goodbye, Tristan.
did you get the novel thing? Because... - I said goodbye.
what are you doing here? - I like lines.
the guy's supposed to buy the tickets. - Really?
does Susan Faludi know about this?
unless, of course, there is no guy. - No, there is a guy.
a cheap guy. - What can I say? I like them cheap.
sloppy, too. Bald spot, beer gut...
and the pants that slip down in the back, giving you that good plumber shot.
that sends me through the roof.
so, who is he?
how many languages can you say 'none of your business' in?
does he go to this school? - No, he doesn't.
look, I'll confess something to you. I don't have a date.
I hear Squeaky Fromme's up for parole soon. You should keep a good thought.
I actually thought you'd like to go with me.
you did not. - I did, too.
you did not, because you are not stupid. - Why, thank you.
slimy and weaselly, yes. But stupid, no.
you'd have to be stupid to think, that given our history, I would ever...
barring a piano or a safe falling on my head...
wanna go anywhere with you. Ever.
okay, fine. I'll take Cissy.
I'll send her a condolence card.
Yeah. At least she won't be buying her own ticket.
two, please.
idiot. - Excuse me?
he was totally nice to you and you were a big jerk.
if you like Tristan so much, you go out with him.
I don't have enough change. - Pay me later.
what am I, your Versateller? Wait for change.
I need change! Now!
you can't be going with someone better than Tristan.
whatever. - You probably don't even have a date.
you're probably going to come down with some rare form of flu...
that only hits losers on dance night.
you know what? I don't want my change. Money makes people shallow.
I've got your change!
if you think I'm keeping this dollar, I'm not!
I'll take it. - Shut up.
come on, already! - I'm primping.
you're 16, you have skin like a baby's ass. There's nothing to primp.
okay, here I come.
someone hit you with a pretty stick.
this dress is amazing. You outdid yourself.
it's beautiful, baby. You look beautiful.
come here. - What?
stray hair. - Fix, please.
I think my favorite part is the shoes.
the heels hurt. - Beauty is pain.
I'll just throw them on on my way out.
you should put them on now and let your feet get numb.
that's sick. - Go get me the hair spray.
it's open! - It's me!
I got tacos.
I got extra hot sauce and a couple of extra burritos...
to put in the fridge for later. - You take such good care of me.
Sookie, look.
Oh, my God! You're a movie star! I'm serious.
at some point tonight, walk down a flight of stairs.
movie stars always walk down staircases.
let me spray while you try to figure out what she said.
you don't move. I got it.
wrong way. I got it. - Are you okay?
Yeah, sweetie. Hand that to your mother.
my eyelashes are all stuck together.
are you sure you're all right? - I'm fine.
shield the tacos.
okay, ready?
God!
that'll be good for six slow dances, four medium ones, one lambada...
but if you wanna do any moshing, I suggest another coat.
no, I think I'm good.
Rory, sweetie, is this soap by the sink in the silver bottle?
no.
go in there, quick.
we're in here!
"we're in here"? That's how you answer the door?
I was all out of Saran wrap. - I don't want to figure that one out.
where is my granddaughter? - Kitchen.
perfect. I wanna be all ready for the big entrance.
how's the light in here? Never mind.
I'll take one with the flash and one without...
to make sure we've got it right.
wow, Mom, look at you.
you'd think Anne Taylor was having a sale or something.
okay, Rory, come in here, please.
Hey, Grandma.
she has lived with you too long. - Lose the bib and the taco...
put your shoes on and come back out. Let Grandma take the pretty picture.
I'm gonna get going. - You are not driving.
I walked.
it's nice to see you again, Mrs. Gilmore, or at least make out your shape.
call me in 15 minutes, or I'll send out a search party.
you call me if I need to come over and help you up the stairs.
no, I'll be fine. - Bye.
why would you need help up the stairs? - No reason.
Rory, let's go. Your public awaits!
why aren't you moving? - I'm comfortable, that's all.
are you hurt? - I have a little back spasm. That's it.
it's no big deal.
what sort of back spasm? - I don't know, Mom. Just a normal one.
there is nothing normal about a back spasm.
the fact that it has the word 'spasm' in it means it's not normal.
here she is. Get your camera moving. - What?
Oh, my god! You're gorgeous. Smile.
I'm so glad you decided to buy her a dress.
that's Dean. - Come here.
have an amazing time.
I'll chronicle the whole evening for you, I promise. Bye, Grandma.
where are you going? - To the dance.
you do not go running out the door when a boy honks.
mom, it's fine. - It certainly is not fine.
this is not a drive-through. She's not fried chicken.
but I told him to honk and I'd meet him out there. We agreed.
I don't care what you told him.
if he wants to take you out, he will walk up to this door...
knock, and say, 'Good evening,' and come inside for a moment...
like any civilized human being would know to do.
this is silly. I have met him already. - I haven't.
Yeah, but... - We will wait until he comes to the door.
he doesn't know he's supposed to. - He'll figure it out.
he's not a very bright boy, is he? - Mom, please.
don't rush. A lady never rushes.
Hey. - Hey.
I thought I was supposed to honk. - I know. I'm sorry.
young man, come in here, please.
Hey, Dean. Meet my mother, Emily Post.
Hi. - Hello.
great rap session. You guys are out of here. Have fun.
be home by 11: 00. - 12: 00.
Bye, Grandma. Bye, Mom. - Bye.
what do you know about this boy? - I know that Rory likes him...
and that his parole officer has high hopes for his rehabilitation.
does he drink? - Like a fish.
that's not a crazy question. - It is a crazy question...
because if I knew he was a drinker, he would not be with Rory now.
Yes, but... - Mom, please relax.
Dean is a good kid. Rory's gonna have a great time.
you got your pictures.
tomorrow I will call you and give you all the details.
what are you going to do? - What do you mean?
you certainly can't be left alone. - Yes, I can.
you can't move. You've been sitting there since I arrived.
that's because this is a right comfy couch.
maybe I should stay. - No, you really don't have to do that.
I'm not leaving my daughter stranded on the couch.
what if you need to get to the bathroom? - I don't go anymore.
I gave it up cold turkey.
I'm staying. - No, Mom.
look, I can stand, okay?
see?
I'm up. Okay, see? I'm fine.
move. - What?
move. If you're fine, then move.
I can move.
this is me moving.
any second now, the moving will begin.
rats.
I'll go start some tea.
please tell me you have something besides Lipton.
a stroke would be so good right about now.
maybe we should just forget about this.
okay.
I mean, it's just a dance. What's the big deal?
beats me.
and these kids at my school... Awful.
have you seen The Outsiders? - Yeah, I have.
just call me Ponyboy.
I heard this place is beautiful, though. Old and historic.
maybe we could just go in for a minute.
fine. - Or not.
fine, too.
I don't know. Why can't I decide?
this is stupid. What do you think?
I think that you look amazing tonight.
maybe just a couple of minutes won't hurt.
Yes, Marta.
just make sure everything's locked up before you leave.
no, I won't be home tonight.
was that a pain? - Yes, a big one.
all right, that's it. Bye.
so, Mom, you really don't have to do this.
don't be silly. I couldn't possibly leave you alone like this.
what are you doing, Mom?
I'm trying to find the candlesticks I bought you.
what candlesticks?
the Baccarat candlesticks I bought you last year for Christmas.
I assume that you stuffed them in the back of the closet somewhere.
no, I did not stuff them in the back of the closet.
then where are they? I don't see them out.
see, we didn't actually...
have a big use for the crystal candlesticks.
so I kind of...
exchanged them.
for what? - A monkey lamp.
pardon me? - It's a lamp with a bunch of monkeys on it.
baccarat crystal candlesticks for a monkey lamp?
they're really happy monkeys, Mom.
where is this lamp? I want to see it.
it's right there on the desk.
Oh, my God! They're holding coconuts and leering.
it's funny.
you traded my lovely gift...
for a semi-pornographic, leering monkey lamp? How could you?
this is not just about returning a gift.
this goes to the very heart of the question of taste.
you were given something of substance, and you cast it off for a ridiculous...
slightly sinister barroom decoration?
explain this to me, Lorelai.
my back hurts.
it's a very good room. - Looks historical.
I commend the person who suggested this location.
so, we could just get our picture taken and leave.
we could.
or we could dance a little first. - Yeah?
I stress 'a little. ' - Something slow.
that sounds good.
can we go yet? - We haven't even eaten dinner.
I'm bored. - We have to wait for Paris anyway.
fine. Give me your roll.
what? - Rory Gilmore.
God, she's got good hair.
who's the dish? - Beats me.
he's not from the manor born, that's for sure.
let's go.
so, should we dance or should we sit first?
Rory, you came.
great dress. Who's it by?
Lorelai Gilmore. - You made it yourself?
no, my mom made it for me. - She did, really?
so, you're traveling with a bodyguard now?
no, this is my... This is Dean.
Dean, this is Louise and Madeline. - Hi.
my mom can't make anything. - How tall are you?
soup, she can make soup. - You know, my whole family is really tall.
I mean, the men mostly. What are you, 6'1," 6'2"?
does he get a prize if he guesses?
one kind of soup, actually. It's green, lumpy.
I'm 6'2." - Actually, she can't make soup either.
6'2" is a good height. - You think?
I think.
what do you think? Too tall?
not in heels. - Good.
although, the saddle shoes make it kind of difficult.
I'll just have to stoop then. - I guess so.
okay, I'm bored.
I like your dress. - Thanks.
Hey, you're nice.
slow song. - Let's go.
I see you came. - You sold me the ticket.
I'm Jacob.
Hi, I'm Rory. This is Dean. - Hi.
excuse us.
those are not friends.
I was being polite. - Well, don't.
so, that's Paris? - Yes, it is.
she seems fun. - Yeah, she is.
okay, this dancing thing is not something I want you to get used to...
or comment on.
now, that goes both ways.
if I kiss you, is a nun gonna come out and boot me out of here?
it's not a Catholic school.
so I can kiss you? - Yeah, you can kiss me.
okay, I'm perfect now. - Great.
you want to dance? - Nope.
you want to eat? - Nope.
you want to go make out?
Yeah, all right, let's go.
so, Ponyboy, you happy?
Yeah, I'm happy.
there you go.
mom, I think somebody already ate that.
that is a mashed banana on toast. - Okay.
I used to make this for you when you were a little girl.
you did? - Whenever you got sick, I made this.
wasn't it the other way around?
you don't want it? - No, I want it.
I'll just take it back. - Mom, I said I want it.
are you sure? Because I could throw it away.
relinquish the banana, please.
you can't possibly be comfortable like that.
mother, please, this is the first position in 24 hours...
that has not made me crazy. - All right.
you're not eating.
mom, please don't make me eat this. - You have to eat something.
Sookie left me a burrito in the fridge.
I'll go warm it up for you. - I can eat it cold.
fine, I'll just go get it then.
hot's better, though.
I'll be right back.
okay, I need something to drink. You want some punch?
sure.
Hi. Rory, right? - Yes.
Jacob. We met earlier with Paris. - Yes, I remember.
are you having a good time? - Actually, I am. You?
it's okay.
so, was that your boyfriend?
I don't know. I'm not sure. - You're not sure?
we've only been going out for a little while...
so there's still a little room to play?
what? - Would you like to dance?
no, thanks.
maybe I could get your number?
what for? - To call you.
I'm sorry, aren't you here with Paris?
so maybe you shouldn't be over here asking me for my number then.
Why? Paris is my cousin.
your cousin? - Yeah.
Paris is your cousin? You're related? - Yeah.
jacob, it's been very nice to meet you. I hope you have a lovely evening.
look, Barbara Stanwyck.
I just love Barbara Stanwyck. - Yeah, she's good.
she had that wonderful voice, that husky, deep voice.
I just love that voice.
you know, Mom, you have kind of a Barbara Stanwycky voice.
I do not. - I mean it.
you could've gotten Fred MacMurray to off Dad if you'd really wanted to.
you do enjoy teasing me, don't you?
you know, I really do.
Rory looked so lovely tonight. - She did, didn't she?
I can't get over how she's grown into that little woman who walked out of here.
I know.
you know what, Mom?
I made the dress.
you did a lovely job. - Thank you.
with Rory and the dress.
thank you.
let me get this out of your way.
you really don't remember me making this for you?
I don't, I'm sorry. - I did, and you loved it.
you know what? Let me give it a try. - All right.
yes?
it's even more disgusting than I thought it was gonna be.
it is not.
Oh, my God, it's horrible! What on earth was I thinking?
so, you wanna maybe go?
you're bored? I'm sorry. Let's go, right away.
I'm not bored. I thought there's still a little time left.
maybe we could get a cup of coffee somewhere...
hang out a little, take a walk. You know, just us.
that'd be nice.
no, you stay. I'll get the coats.
so how many people have you told?
four? Five? Everybody? - What are you talking about?
you know that Jacob is my cousin.
now you have all the ammunition you needed to pay me back, right?
I don't wanna pay you back, I wanna get away.
now you can go all over school telling everyone...
that Paris Geller couldn't get a date to the dance. That she had no one.
since she couldn't just not come, she had to ask her cousin to take her.
she had to give him gas money to make him do it.
go ahead, tell them!
I don't have to. You just did.
we haven't met. - No, we haven't.
I'm Tristan. - Yes, we have.
what are you talking about? - Rory's mentioned you.
yeah? - I wouldn't get quite so excited about it.
why, did she say something mean? - She said you're a jackass.
Really? - Actually, no.
Rory doesn't use words like that. I embellished a little.
so you're the big, strong protector?
little princess needs a protector.
what's your problem, man? - Nothing.
I just don't like your girlfriend. - Really?
it doesn't look that way to me. - I don't care how it looks to you.
you got in my path, not the other way around.
you're kidding, right? - Why, are you going somewhere?
get out of my way, Dristan. - Aren't you clever?
what's going on?
nothing. Just getting to know your boyfriend.
it's going real well, don't you think? - Yeah.
we're just about to build a clubhouse.
I hate to break up the party, but we should go.
Why? Little girl's got to be home? - Stop!
no, I think you two make a very cute couple.
is your horse and buggy parked outside? Gotta get home for the barn raising?
let's go.
what the hell do you think you're doing? - You will not push me again!
are you seriously trying to act tough? You're wearing a tie, for God's sake!
outside, now.
no, it'd be like fighting an accountant. I'll call you when I need my taxes done.
you don't want to fight me, Tristan! - Why not?
cause I'll kill you, idiot!
come on, Rory.
you will not come near her ever again.
that was good. - Whatever.
are you okay?
did you really bring your cousin?
what are you doing? - Go to sleep.
the movie's not over. - I'll tell you how it ends.
thank you, Mommy.
that was quite a dance.
I seriously don't know what got into him.
I do. - What?
he has a thing for you.
no, he doesn't. It's just a game to him or something.
he has a thing for you.
he does nothing but insult me and make me miserable.
he has a thing for you.
I don't know how I feel about this whole situation.
what do you mean? - I don't know.
having my boyfriend defend my honor. It's weird.
boyfriend?
what? - You said 'boyfriend. '
no, I just meant boyfriend...
in the sense that the defending-me thing was very boyfriendy...
but only in the broadest sense of the word...
which doesn't even apply at all here.
you are seriously babbling.
I didn't mean that you were my boyfriend. - Okay.
I don't think you're my boyfriend. - Okay.
what? - Are you my boyfriend?
in the 'broadest sense of the word' way?
no, in the real...
"hi, this is Dean, my boyfriend," kind of way.
well, I am if you want me to be.
I do.
so it's settled. - Yes, it is.
you're my boyfriend. - That's the consensus.
I'm feeling pretty good about this decision.
well, I'm very glad to hear it.
I guess Miss Patty forgot to lock up.
I've never really seen in here before.
are all these women really Miss Patty? - Yeah.
she said she's done everything in show business...
except set fire to the hoop the dog jumps through.
I'll get it.
God, this weighs a ton. What do you have in here?
I don't know.
a lipstick, $5 bill, gum, hair spray, a book.
a book? - Yeah.
you brought a book to the dance? - Yeah.
you thought there'd be a lot of downtime?
no. I just take a book with me everywhere. It's just habit.
so, what are you reading? - The Portable Dorothy Parker.
there's little in taking or giving There's little in water or wine 'This living, this living, this living Was never a project of mine'
cheery. - Funny, though.
Hey. - What?
thank you for tonight. It was perfect. - You're welcome.
okay, ladies, grab your yoga mats.
Oh, my goodness, it's Lorelai's girl!
Patty, Rory Gilmore is here. - What?
she's over here, asleep with the bag boy from the market.
what are we supposed to do?
Rory, honey, it's Miss Patty.
Rory? What are you doing here?
miss Patty?
Yes. Have you been here all night?
Oh, no. Dean, wake up.
what time is it? - It's 5: 30 in the morning.
Oh, my God, we fell asleep. How could we have fallen asleep?
calm down, I'll explain it to your mom.
Where's my purse? - I got it. Relax.
I have to go.
wait up! - I have to go!
I'm going with you. We'll explain. It'll be okay.
you can't come. You shouldn't be near my house right now.
it's not our fault. - I know. I just have to get home.
please let me come with you. - No!
I have to go home.
Lorelai, get up. Right now! - What?
Rory's not home.
Rory's what?
I sat all night. I dozed off for one second.
the next thing I know, it's 5: 30 and she's not here.
she's not there. Aren't you listening?
Where's the phone? Call the police.
what are you doing? Call the police!
mom, stop it! - What are you doing?
I'm looking for the phone!
why don't you ever clean up around here?
you can't find the phone in an emergency. What if there was a fire?
what if Rory was choking?
mom, stop yelling. - Rory is missing!
I know that, and your yelling is not helping me.
what?
Thanks.
no, thank you so much. Okay, bye-bye.
Rory's okay. - Where is she? What happened?
she and Dean were at Miss Patty's.
what is that, a motel?
it's a dance studio. That was Patty. She said that she found them asleep...
and woke them up, and Rory's on her way home.
and what state were they found in? - She didn't say, okay?
let's be calm until we know what happened.
what do you mean? We know what happened.
no, we don't. - They were out all night!
I'm gonna make some coffee.
Lorelai, I've watched you do a lot of stupid things in your life, and I have held my tongue.
- You've what?
but I will not stand by and let you allow that girl to ruin her life.
back off.
she spent the night out with that boy...
the one you let her run off to that dance with.
so help me God, I will not get into this with you.
she's doing the same thing you did. - No, she's not.
she'll get pregnant. - No, she's not.
she's gonna ruin everything, just like you did.
no, she's not!
Rory is a good kid, Mom! She's not me!
what kind of mother are you to allow this?
I don't know. What kind of mother were you?
you're gonna lose her just like I lost you.
I am not gonna lose her. Do you hear me?
even if I hadn't gotten pregnant, you'd still have lost me.
I had nothing in that house. I had no life, no air.
you strangled me. I do not strangle Rory.
you're so perfect, and I was so horrible.
I put you in good schools. I gave you the best of everything.
I made sure you had the finest opportunities.
and I am so tired of hearing about...
how you were suffocated and I was so controlling.
if I was so controlling...
why couldn't I control you getting pregnant and throwing your life away?
get out. - What?
you will not come into my house and tell me I threw my life away.
look around, Mom. This is a life.
it has a little color, so it may look unfamiliar to you.
but it's a life.
if I hadn't gotten pregnant, I wouldn't have Rory.
that's not what I meant.
maybe I was some horrible, uncontrollable child like you say...
but Rory isn't.
she's smart and careful, and I trust her. She's gonna be fine.
if you can't accept or believe that, then I don't want you in this house!
mom, thank you for saying all those...
what were you thinking, staying out all night? Are you insane?
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
you're talking to the queen of staying out. I invented the concept.
