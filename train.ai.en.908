she's just...she's out of control right now.
you know,
I think it's time to tell Spencer's parents about what's going on.
Oh, god.
no, I don't want to have to do that.
if you don't, I'll have to.
and it becomes a much bigger deal if a teacher gets involved.
but can't we just let her figure this out on her own?
Aria, Spencer doesn't remember driving to school.
she could have killed someone.
I know. I know that.
but she's a really strong person.
and I promise you, she'll get herself out of this.
at what cost? Do you remember Radley?
Yes.
she thought she found Toby, dead in the woods.
that's exactly my point.
seeing a motorcycle helmet and a tattoo is enough to unravel her completely.
you're right.
how did you find out about that?
the tattoo part?
what do you mean?
I mean, how did you know that Spencer only saw the helmet and a tattoo?
I just don't think that was included in any of the reports or anything.
I think you must have told me.
Yeah. I probably did.
can I top you off?
Oh, no. I'm good, Emily. Thanks.
Yeah, I can't talk right now.
can I call you back?
seriously, now is not a good time.
no, I know, I just...I don't know if I can do it.
we don't even know if Ali's actually going to show up.
nice. I think he's listening.
Oh, he's definitely listening.
okay. Now say something like.
I know she needs some money, but it's too dangerous.
I know she needs some money, but it's too dangerous.
tell her to get closer to this mush fries.
just in case he can hear.
just mention the location...
Yeah, I heard you.
Ambrose Pavilion closing. I got to go.
Hi, good afternoon, this is Veronica Hastings calling on behalf of my daughter Spencer.
we were just hoping to refill her prescription today.
if you would, would you please give me a call back at...
you know, actually I'll just try you back again later.
thank you.
Andrew. Hi.

password accepted - Hello? - Mrs. Hastings?
yes?
I'm returning your call from Dr. Griggs's office.
Dr. Griggs?
I spoke to the doctor and he'd really be more comfortable if Spencer came in to see him before he re-ups her prescription.
there must be some mistake we haven't seen Dr. Griggs in years.
I have it here that you've called several times.
is that right?
Mrs. Hastings?
Thanks. I'll call you back.
Norris town zoo
we have less than an hour before closing.
okay. Ambrose Pavilion.
according to this, we should be right here.
Oh, over there.
Hanna. - I can't.
Ambrose REPTILE PAVILION
I'm sorry, just looking at the sign gives me heebie-jeebies.
you'll be fine. They're all behind glass.
Hanna, come on. There's nothing to be scared of.
reptiles first appeared 340 million years ago in Carboniferous Period.
the snake is so cool.
do you think it eats mice? - Yeah.
the black mamba...
only Ali would think it's sexy to make out in front of a bunch of reptiles.
that one is sleeping. - Come on.
can you just toss that thing so we can get out of here.
no. We have to wait for Spencer to get into position.
where is she?
I don't know. She should have been here by now.
what a gyp.
there's nothing in this one except a log covered in goo.
Oh, my god.
carnivores DELIGHT
the first thing Alison ever told me about herself was a lie.
lying was her oxygen.
she could do it while she was laughing.
she could even do it when she was kissing you.
the zoo will close in 5 minutes.
this is Spencer's plan.
she wouldn't have gotten it wrong.
there's Spencer.
finally, let's move.
reptiles first appeared 340 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period.

Aria, I know you're out there.
why are you hiding from me?
why are you doing this? Just come out and talk to me.
please, just don't do this. Please come out and talk to me.
skilift hours 7am to 8pm
why isn't Spencer doing anything?
she'll make her move when she thinks "A" is here.
and you think that it's going to be Ezra who shows up?
guess we'll find out soon.
okay, once Spencer gives us the signal, we'll double-back.
God, you guys. I'm so sorry, I'm late.
just help me get this on and then I can move into position.
the lift is closing in 5 minutes.
Aria, Aria, Aria, I didn't mean for it to end this way. Okay.
damn it! - Gosh.
she was just here. - Who was?
let's get out of here.
the Black Mamba is the longest venomous snake in Africa...
the Brown tree snake is arboreal and terrestrial.
from hibernation.
green Anaconda is the largest snake in the world.
reptile black mamba is the longest venomous snake in Africa.
the zoo is closed to the general public. You have to leave.
sorry.
we got locked in. We're going now.
the Anaconda is the largest snake in the world.
help! Somebody help me!
stop, stop. Please, please,
I know you're upset, but just hear me out.
don't touch me.
why did we stop?
I know what you saw back there, and I can explain it.
you knew Alison. You knew her.
you pretended not to, and you're...
Yes, yes.
I know, I lied. I'm so sorry.
I wanted to tell you so many times, but I was afraid.
I was afraid that you wouldn't forgive me.
I met Alison in college.
she lied about her age and I believed her.
I don't want to hear this. I don't want to hear it.
I just want to get off. - Aria, please, just listen to me.
nothing you say will change anything.
I don't even know who you are.
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
you wanted Alison dead.
you wanted her dead. You thought you got her pregnant.
I never hurt Alison. I was writing a book about her.
a true crime book.
a book? - Yeah.
when I saw in the papers that she had gone missing, I...
I couldn't stop thinking about it.
I had to get to the bottom of the story.
did you know who I was when we met?
Yes, I did. I knew who all of you were.
and that's why I applied to teach at Rosewood.
so that's what I was to you? I was research?
when I saw you in the bar, I took advantage of an opportunity because I wanted to be a good reporter.
I wanted to be the guy that would do anything for the story, but I promise you though.
I didn't know I was going to fall in love with you.
don't.
I lied about a lot of things.
Ezra, don't!
I lied about a lot of things.
but I have never lied to you, not once about how I feel about you.
when we started getting serious, I stopped writing the book.
I started my research back up again when we broke up and that's how I knew that Alison was still alive.
when I think about how I defended you to my family and my friends.
and the whole time you were...you were using me.
I'm sorry, I'm such an idiot.
I'm such an idiot. I'm a jerk.
but I swear, I'll burn this, I'll trash it.
burn it? Burn it?
are you kidding me?
I'm going to read this thing from cover to cover.
Aria, please don't.
no. No, I want to know what was worth destroying everything we had for.
look. - No!
I was going to say you missed half the movie, but that was like 20 minutes ago.
I'm sorry. Kind of lost track of time.
well, can we watch the rest?
I don't mind being a little lost.
well, you won't be.
movie is about a creepy guy who makes creepy sculptures and acts creepy about it.
I'm gonna get a refill. You want something?
no, thanks.
Aria? Are you okay?
Hey, what are you doing here?
your mom was worried about you.
why would my mom be worried about me?
she called me, looking for you.
I wish you could have told me what was really going on, instead of me finding out this way.
Spencer? Is that you?
I guess I'll give you guys some time to talk.
this is for you.
there was a whole dinner that went with it, but...doesn't matter.
wait, Toby. Can you just wait a second?
I wasn't trying to ditch you.
goodbye, Toby. Thank you for coming over.
good night, Mrs. Hastings.
mom, why did you ask Toby here?
you promised.
you promised you wouldn't go back to this again.
go back to what?
I don't know what you mean. - Spencer, stop it.
Dr. Griggs's office called, I know.
mom, I'm sorry.
I can't go through this with you again.
I just don't think I have it in me.
it's not like last time though, I swear.
you didn't know what you were doing half the time.
and your father and I can't cover for you again, not with Radley on your resume.
what's that supposed to mean?
I need to call your father. Let him know you're okay.
it sounds like Toby had a beautiful evening planned.
it's too bad you missed it.
Sberwood Anderson Winesburg. OHIO
did you actually read any of his book?
Ezra knew who I was before we met.
he knew who all of us were.
do you always carry that much cash around?
who is the money for? - The money is for Ali.
she's alive.
how did it go?
that cop, Holbrook, spoke up for my dad.
I was surprised to hear that you spoke up for Mr. Hobbs. Thank you.
okay, stop.
what are you up to?
your mother and I spoke with Dr. Griggs this morning.
he recommended a rehab facility in Philly.
Ezra is moving forward with the book.
he is meeting with his agent in New York right now discussing a release date.
now I know that everything he says or has ever said is a lie.
are you going somewhere? - That's the plan.
I got to get out of here.
it's a simple question, okay.
did you or did you not see me standing with a shovel that night?
and if you did see me hurt Ali, then why didn't you just call the cops?
Hey. - Hi.
anything for the dry cleaners?
it was 3 days in rehab, Mom.
I really did not need so many sweaters.
I thought, I don't know, maybe you'd go outside for some fresh air or if you got cold.
I did get cold and then I got the sweats.
you know, withdrawal symptoms can't really be stopped with a cable knit.
they said that the medical detox would help mitigate your discomfort.
it did, mom. I was so comfortable kicking my drug habit.
sorry.
I'm very irritable.
they said to expect irritability over the next few days.
as long as you're home and well, I can handle it.
don't you walk away from me.
is there anything you need?
there's left-over carbonara or I can make a salad if you'd like something lighter.
you're way out of your league, Spencer.
you sure about that?
put that thing down before you hurt yourself.
I said you look tired.
maybe you should get some rest.
we have some things to discuss in the morning.
mom? Have you seen my car keys?
I want to get to school early and catch up on any assignments that I might have missed.
Oh, I'm so sorry to interrupt.
honey, this is Dean Stavros.
he's going to be staying with us for a while.
Hi.
sweetheart, you're not going back to school just yet.
we've already taken your car keys.
I'll need your cellphone and your laptop as well.
but why?
there will be no phone calls of any kind, no internet, no friends.
we'll be sure to get your assignments from school.
and how do you expect me to turn them in? Carrier pigeon?
you'll earn your privileges back over time, as long as you follow Dean's program.
the doctor said that I was fine to go back to school, as long as I agreed to outpatient counseling.
could you please excuse us? I need to talk to my mom.
actually, I don't think I can.
Spencer, I'm a drug and alcohol abuse counselor.
your parents brought me here to help you.
I'm gonna be camped out in the barn, on-call 24/7...
so you're basically a baby-sitter.
do you and Dad distrust me this much?
quite frankly, given this latest episode, yes.
I understand you may be feeling a little ambushed.
excuse me. How long am I supposed to stay under guard?
I have to apologize for my daughter.
Oh, as long as you're handing them out, I would love an apology from you.
your father and I thought the first time would be the last.
since you've relapsed... - I would hardly call this a relapse.
Spencer, look, I bet your mom would be a whole lot more open to hearing you out if you hand over your electronics.
show her you're willing to cooperate.
can I please just call Toby?
I tried him last night and he hasn't called me back yet.
I've had a conversation with Toby and he understands that you'll be hard to reach for the time being.
it will give us all a chance to focus.
great.
where do we start?
fantastic.
I will go upstairs and fill this with my dignity.
I'm still at Syracuse.
does your dad know what happened?
no. No. He thinks I'm here for a Prospective Student Week.
it's 4 days of campus tours, classroom visits, and a bunch of father-daughter bonding time.
how are you doing? Really.
um, honestly, I'm just trying not to think about any of it.
him. Everything.
you don't have to go through this on your own.
you know, we can all come up there.
no, it's okay. I'm not alone.
I just mean that my dad's here with me.
look, I've got to go. The tour's starting. Bye.
morning, sunshine.
no, don't start. You look worse than me.
no. I don't.
you ready to learn about the history of this illustrious institution?
I'm ready for some sleep or coffee.
I don't know, an aspirin.
Yeah, my student host didn't exactly offer continental breakfast.
okay, everyone, over here for the tour please.
we...we really need to go on this thing?
I know a place nearby. Killer pancakes.
you mean bail on the tour?
only if you want.
I want. - All right.
come on. Give those back. I need them.
this way, over here.
aria finally called me this morning.
is she still mad at me?
she's not mad, she's hurting.
but she sounded okay.
distant. Are we still going to Spencer's later?
it was so weird. I called her cell and her mom answered.
there's no visitors and she's not gonna be in school for a while.
probably for the best.
I saw Fitz's car in the teacher's parking lot.
wait, he's back?
so he just goes to New York to collect the big, fat check for selling us out.
and then what, comes back here to gloat?
I wish you would have told me this before I bought tickets.
do you want to go at all?
I'm sorry, Mike. I don't know what to say.
give me a call when you figure it out.
looks like he's still pulling Mona's strings.
do you think Fitz was behind whatever that was?
I mean, Mike and Mona didn't really make much sense unless...
unless she was spying on Aria for him.
now I'm mad. We should say something.
are you coming? - I can't.
if you're gonna slash his tires or bust his headlights, I'd still be down.
but I don't want to be in the same room with him.
I know. I get it.
Hey, I'm gonna ditch last period. Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Emily, class doesn't start for another few minutes.
okay, I don't know how much you know but as close as you are to Aria,
I can assume that you know everything.
I really want to talk to about this, Emily, but I would really prefer if it were outside of a classroom.
I don't think that's going to happen.
I've already talked to you outside of the classroom.
I let you help me with my college essays.
you tutored me.
you helped me when I lost my girlfriend.
why did you do all of that?
what did you get out of it?
there's an assignment due today, but I won't be staying for the class.
will you make sure a real teacher gets this?
don't get up. I don't want to accidentally run into your mouth again.
is that what that was?
look, it wasn't supposed to happen.
and it's not going to ever again. I promise.
I'm sure Travis will be glad to hear that.
after court, when I passed the two of you talking,
it seemed like there was a look.
do you have a minute to sit?
you know, I actually just came to apologize.
I just...I thought it would be weird if I saw you and I didn't say anything.
is there anything else you want to talk about?
no. I'm good.
well, there's a couple of things I'd like to ask you.
please sit.
what do you know about this?
attention: officer Holbrook
I've never seen this before.
you recognize the handwriting?
why don't you open it up, read the note inside?
it might look familiar.
I know for a fact Alison Dilaurentis is alive. Start looking for her.
A.D. Incorporatcd P.C.Box 537 Wallingford, PA
what is this?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I didn't write it, if that's what you're asking.
I thought it was a possibility.
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask.
well, you don't think that's real, do you?
I mean you're not going to go looking for Alison now, are you?
no, don't worry. We get stuff like that all the time.
it's probably just another crackpot.
I have to go meet my mom for dinner.
it's a little early for that, don't you think?
it's my turn to cook.
that's good.
no, keep playing.
no, I just...I just wanted to give Antonio a little air.
Oh, you named your guitar Antonio?
I like to think Antonio named himself.
you slept well?
um, yeah, a little bit.
I still feel like my head's a bowling ball, but I don't think I'm gonna yak on my shoes anymore.
Hey, that's progress.
you don't normally drink, do you?
this week's anything but normal.
why is that?
Oh, we missed the last tour, huh?
we can learn about the Hall of Languages and the billion dollar endowment another day.
so your dad...
I thought you were staying with your dad.
I am. Yeah, he's...he's just right next door.
so what does he profess?
art history.
you into art, too? - A little.
um, I like to write, but who knows now.
what...what are you looking for?
hair of the dog.
that's supposed to cure hangover, right?
God, we totally raided this thing.
who drank the pineapple rum? - Guilty.
how much do you think all this stuff cost?
no, not too much a lot. Maybe a couple of hundred dollars.
I'm serious. - Me, too.
just tell your dad you had the drunkies.
and invited a boy over. - Yeah.
mm, I think that will go over real well.
I know you dug her grave. Now I'm digging yours. Kiss. - A
look, somebody else knows Alison's alive and they just told the cops.
does Holbrook know who it's from?
did he say if it was from a guy or a girl?
it's anonymous. And they're still trying to figure it out.
I'll be right back.
what's up? Your text said I should come find you.
Yeah, my mom wanted to invite you and your family over for dinner just to say thanks for everything.
that's really nice of her, but she doesn't have to go through that.
trust me, you don't want to miss it.
she doesn't really cook often, but when she does it's pretty amazing.
okay.
you know, I was thinking maybe you and I could do a meal sometime.
just the two of us. - Sure.
wait, is that like a date?
I actually hope it will be.
how about tomorrow night?
Yeah, okay. - Okay.
did he just ask you out?
okay, I'm not digging the timing, but...
are you even ready for that? - No, I'm ready.
I just hope nothing else crazy happens between now and then.
drinking a glass of salad is supposed to give me my life back?
your body needs the nutrition.
you'll feel stronger, you'll think clearer, you'll sleep better.
I sleep just fine.
I heard you doing laundry at 2: 00 in the morning.
my sheets were dirty.
what, do you want to analyze those, too?
I just thought it was unusual.
you know, with ADHD meds people tend to sleep a lot during withdrawal.
and you're definitely irritable.
any flu-like symptoms?
not anymore.
what about nightmares?
um, what about hallucinations?
maybe.
they're nothing to worry about.
it's just your mind and body getting reacquainted.
take drugs away and things come up.
what kind of things?
things you've forgotten.
things you've suppressed. Things you need to deal with.
when I was first in recovery, a healthy diet and exercise really worked for me.
I mean, it took the edge off. It's worth a try.
ever do yoga? - No, not usually.
I don't really excel at athletics unless there's somebody to beat.
I'd like to avoid competition.
I think that drive may have triggered your abuse in the first place.
but kicking your ass at tennis might be very therapeutic.
Yeah, I get the feeling you'd like to kick my ass, period.
but I'm in the barn until your parents and doctor say otherwise.
so get motivated. We've got a lot to cover today.
I'm just gonna take a quick shower.
Toby, hey, please I really, really need to talk to you.
I'm starting to worry because I haven't heard from you.
I just need you to tell me that I'm not, like, a horrible person.
how come I don't hear any running water?
I know what you did. And I am not amused.
since when is getting a skinny latte a crime?
we're not here to joke around, Hanna.
Gabe, what is she talking about?
it won't be hard for me to match your handwriting to the note.
when I do, I'll have to bring you down for questioning.
Hanna, if there's anything else you have to say about the note, now is the time.
she's not going to find anything.
I swear, I didn't write it.
good cop, bad cop, " I thought that would do the job, but she's one tough little cookie.
I kind of like her.
we arrested her mother and we were wrong.
and we put that family through hell.
my gut tells me that she's trying to do the same thing.
she's giving us the runaround.
I know this girl. Something doesn't jive.
I think that note's legit.
you're on your own with that theory.
but keep an eye on her.
let's see if she takes this to one of her friends.
maybe they're all in on it.
is that your dad? - Yep.
he wants to take me into some restaurant tonight, a little quality father-daughter time.
Jeremiah's?
Yeah. How did you know that?
that's the only good vegetarian place around here.
how do you know so much about SU?
I thought that you were from Cedar Rapids.
I am. But my parents went to school here.
they met on campus in chem lab, freshman year.
I have three older sisters and they all graduated from Syracuse, too.
let me guess.
you don't want to continue the tradition?
I got into Berklee College of Music.
that's amazing.
Yeah, well, my parents don't think music is the kind of thing you study.
what about you?
I...I love music.
you know what I mean.
you clearly didn't come here to look at a college.
um, some jerk just broke my heart into, like, 30, 000 million pieces.
that's a lot.
tell me about it.
anyway, so, yeah, he's back home and that's why I'm here.
just needed to disappear for a little bit, I guess.
that doesn't seem right.
he's the jerk, but you're the one in exile?
shouldn't it be the other way around?
not that I'm complaining or anything.
Yeah, you better not be.
I can finish this. Why don't you go up and put your laundry away?
okay.
Thanks.
I'll get it.
Spencer. Veronica, may I come in?
I was just stopping by to see if you got the flyer I left in your mailbox about the bridal show fund-raiser.
I did. - I didn't get your RSVP.
I'll have to check the calendar. I'll be right back.
you're looking well.
your mother told me that you had a bug.
your outburst at my home was a reaction to some over-the-counter medication?
Yeah, yeah.
next time I'll be sure to buy name brand.
I'm so sorry for everything that I said and for the way that I grabbed you.
I really was not myself.
no apology necessary.
my guess is she's in there writing a check.
I wouldn't expect her to attend.
but it's all for a good cause.
you know, the charity feeds starving children.
no mother should have to watch her child die.
um, I should probably just take my laundry up and go to bed.
nothing beats a good night's sleep on a set of fresh, clean sheets.
I'm sorry, Jessica.
we have another commitment that night.
I hope this helps. - Thank you.
I so appreciate your generosity.
goodbye, Spencer.
well, you sure do look nice.
you ready for our last big day?
I actually just came by to let you know I'm gonna cut out early.
head back home.
maybe take Antonio on the scenic route.
you're gonna go talk to your folks about Berklee?
that's the plan.
look, I just wanted to say,
I thought this was gonna be a pretty unbearable week and it ended up being pretty great.
so thank you.
you should find me if you're ever in Rosewood.
count on it.
Bye.
thank you.
have you talked to Aria?
not today. Why?
she's not answering any of my calls or texts.
look, if you hear from her, tell her I said, "thanks.
Mike, hold on.
can you take over for a sec? Thanks.
what's going on? - Aria got what she wanted.
Mona dumped me this morning.
I got a text really early that said we're done. Just like that.
okay, I'm sorry that happened but I don't think Aria was involved.
Oh, so the fact that you guys can't stand her has nothing to do with it?
I can't think of another reason why Mona would just cut me off like a wart.
maybe I could talk to her. Find out what's going on.
whatever.
just tell Aria to call me.
beat up a jerk card
Hey, we just did 3 loops, that's 3 miles.
and now we're doing an extra loop for your little phone stunt yesterday.
God, why are you so mean, Dean?
because you make me tense, Spence.
I mean how long are you gonna keep this up?
Rhyming? I could go all day.
look.
I can see that you're a smart girl with a sharp tongue, and you love to spar.
but getting under my skin isn't the goal here.
it's getting under yours so we can address what's really going on.
do you have any interest in that?
one more mile. Let's go.
damn it, Ali, I said stop it.
Hey, hey, take a deep breath.
now tell me what's going on.
I think I know what I did.
do you ever ...
think that sometimes people see you more clearly than you see yourself?
I'm not sure what you mean.
there are things that happened that I don't remember and other people do.
and you're using their memories to fill in the blanks?
Yeah. What else can I do?
well, maybe recalling what really happened is a little too much to wrap your head around right now.
I mean I should have known that I was capable of something like this.
I've done bad things before.
wait. Look, before you go to that place,
I want you to look at what happened today as a positive.
it sounds like to me, at least emotionally, you're ready to take responsibility for your actions.
you want to know what you did, maybe make good on a few things.
how am I supposed to take responsibility?
I mean if I...if I really did this.
did what, Spencer?
nothing.
nothing. I'm sorry. I'm really talked-out right now.
I think we've covered enough.
I'm gonna give you some space so you can read that.
just so you know, I'm a picker.
so whatever I order, the other person's plate always looks better.
what does that even mean?
it means whatever you order, get a side of garlic bread.
Hanna? - Hi, Mrs. D.
don't you look lovely tonight?
are we on a date?
Yeah. Yeah. This is Travis.
nice to meet you.
such a gentleman.
I won't keep you. You two enjoy yourselves.
Mrs. DiLaurentis?
lieutenant Tanner. - Detective Holbrook.
please come with us.
I'm sorry. This will just take one moment.
uh, so if you want the garlic bread, maybe I should order the lasagna.
Yeah, yeah, sounds good.
I need to talk to you. - I have somewhere to be.
going to meet with Ezra Fitz?
get in.
Aria. - Can I come in?
why would you help him?
I'm surprised it took you this long to figure it out.
and I kind of expected it would be Aria.
he should have told her about the book a long time ago.
when did you find out?
around the time I bought Jenna's car.
but I didn't want to help him with his tattle-tale, I wanted to stop him.
or at least, stop the parts that included me, some of the stuff I did, I could still go to jail for.
so we made a deal.
I would answer questions about my exploits, and he'd edit out anything I did that was less than legal.
did you read the book?
do you know what it says about Alison?
if Alison were alive, I'm sure she'd love being the focus of a scandalous page-turner.
but no, Ezra only showed me parts of chapters I was written into.
I never saw the whole thing.
I didn't come here to hash things out.
I came here to tell you that you need to leave.
Yeah, I understand you need your space.
no, I don't think that you understand.
I do. I spoke with Hackett yesterday and I'm taking a leave of absence.
no, Ezra.
you need to leave town. For good.
Aria, we can work through this. - I don't want to work through this.
I don't want to run into you at the grocery or every time I grab coffee with my friends I don't want to see you.
I don't want to hear from you. Ever.
so you dated Mike to get closer to Aria, so you could spy on her.
Mike's a really sweet guy. I fell for him.
when you guys started to catch on, I tried to tell Fitz I wanted out.
he said that wasn't an option.
I didn't want to drag Mike into my mess, so I let him go.
you went through all that and got nothing?
not nothing.
it's murky, but it's big.
remember, after the lodge burned down,
I told you all that someone stole the game from me when I was in Radley?
we all thought it was CeCe. - I never found out.
but whoever it is, Ezra thinks he knows.
this is a copy of my manuscript.
Thanks, but I think I'll wait till it's in the clearance bin.
I really think you should read it.
I found some stuff out that can really help you.
and for what it's worth, I was in New York returning my publisher's advance.
I thought if I pulled the plug... - It's too late, Ezra.
well, I guess this is good-bye then.
I'm about to kill this dessert. You'd better jump in if you want a bite.
Oh, no, you can finish it.
something wrong?
look, Travis, I'm so sorry. I've got to go.
can I please just pay for my half?
I don't go Dutch on the first date.
you sure everything's okay? Do you want me to drop you somewhere?
no, it's just a friend.
I knew something was up.
you've been distracted almost the whole night.
and it's not just since that text came in.
I'm just a little rusty.
it's been a while since I've been on a date.
come on, this wasn't a date. Your phone makes a lousy third wheel.
look, it won't happen again, I promise.
I just...I really have to go.
Thanks.
look, I know it didn't seem like it, but I had a really great time.
so you think that Mona left that anonymous tip?
well, if she was upset that she had to dump Mike, maybe she was trying to make Fitz pay.
it could all lead back to Ezra.
it might stop him from publishing while they investigate.
em, how long has this been there?
what...what are you talking about?
the blue envelope.
it's a note from Paige. Why?
sorry. I had to finish reading it to be sure, but...
Ezra gave me a copy of his book. - You talked to him?
Mona dumped your brother, and he thinks you made her do it, but really it was because of Ezra.
sorry. Housekeeping.
Yeah, I'll deal with that.
you're back. Are you better?
better, yeah, but it's your SOS, so why don't you go first?
okay, there is something that Ezra wanted us to know.
I thought you went to Syracuse to get away from him? What changed?
I...I just figured out how to say what needed to be said.
and then he gave me a copy of his book.
you guys, you're never going to believe this, but Ezra thinks that "A" is Ali's mom.
are you sure that's what it says? That Mrs. DiLaurentis is "A"?
that's ridiculous. How old is she? Does she even know how to text?
a" has been telling us to stop going after Alison probably because "A" wants to bring her home.
but that's exactly what we've been trying to do.
why would Mrs. DiLaurentis think that we were in the way?
maybe because she thinks I tried to kill Ali.
when did Ali's mom accuse you of attempted murder?
and why are you just now telling us this?
look, the other night I found a bunch of dirt in the bottom of my bed and Ali's mom made some cryptic comment about it.
don't pin that on her. I mean that sounds like an "A" move.
which is why I think she's "A.
Mrs. D being "A" makes about as much sense as you whacking Ali over the head with a shovel.
I could have.
Cece told Ezra that both she and Mrs. DiLaurentis saw me pick up a shovel and go after Ali.
but Alison is still alive.
we argued that night, okay.
and we'd all been drinking but I was also on amphetamines.
I don't remember anything and lately I've been seeing things.
I don't know if it's just me coming off of the drugs or if it is a guilty conscience.
but if two people saw me... - Why believe anything CeCe says?
because it wasn't just CeCe. Ezra put it in his book, okay.
he thinks that one of us tried to kill her and that person is probably me.
the only person that knows what really happened is Alison.
Yeah, and she's not here to help us, is she?
I can't talk about this anymore. I'm gonna get a snack.
somebody want anything?
Yeah, sure. - I'm not hungry.
I'll come with you.
Hey, Em, can I ask you something?
we don't have any cheesy puffs.
my mom says the orange powder has chemicals in it that make you break out.
no, it's...look, it's important and I need you to tell me the truth.
you told Paige that Alison's alive, didn't you?
dad put some leftovers in the fridge for you.
I ate 'em.
it's fine, I had something at Emily's.
I heard about Mona.
Mike, I'm really sorry.
I know how much it hurts.
you know that I would never... - I know.
it was just easier to blame you than admit you were right all along.
maybe about this.
but there are plenty of other things that I'm wrong about.
are we going to have to lock you in your room at night?
mom, I'm sorry. It was really, really important.
more important than staying sober? - No.
were you out looking for drugs? - What? Mom, no.
the drawer was open. Did you...give me your phone.
what does "SOS" mean? And why were you meeting up at Emily's?
hanging out with your friends, that's what was so important?
I'm about ready to throw my hands up.
you keep flirting with disaster no matter how hard we try to protect you.
maybe you should stop.
it's about a quarter past sarcasm, Spencer.
you want to try another tone? - I'm not being sarcastic.
you and Dad said that you covered for me that summer when I was first using.
what did you mean? Because I still don't remember.
consider it a blessing.
I'm going to bed. I suggest you do the same.
are you okay?
it belongs to Alison. There's contact information there, maybe for other people who are helping her, or places to stay.
this is Dean Stavros. He's going to be staying with us for a while.
I'm a drug and alcohol abuse counselor.
when police were questioning you about that night, why wouldn't you just tell them?
last night my sister was alive.
and it would have made me a suspect.
what is this? - I was hoping you could tell me.
I didn't write it.
somebody else knows Alison's alive and they told the cops.
Mrs. DiLaurentis? - I'm Detective Holbrook.
we'd like to have a couple of words. - Something wrong?
this is a copy of my manuscript.
I found some stuff out that could really help you.
Ezra thinks that "A" is Ali's mom.
and Mrs. DiLaurentis saw me pick up the shovel and go after Ali.
she thinks I tried to kill Ali.
48 hours earlier
so wait. You think that Paige gave that note to the police?
we don't think, we know.
I mean it was her handwriting and her stationery.
em, have you spoken to her yet?
she's in Maine visiting her family.
you guys, if the police know that Ali is alive...
then we're all gonna get dragged in that precinct.
honestly, I'm a lot more worried about Alison than I'm about us.
so what are we gonna say when the cops ask whose bones are in Ali's grave?
that we don't know.
you guys, if the cops are gonna question anybody, it's gonna be me.
I'm the one who Ali's mom saw with that shovel.
but Ali's alive, Spencer. - Yeah, and somebody else isn't.
and I'm the one who might have bashed in the skull of a stranger.
okay, you really need to eat something. Hanna, give her your cookie.
you give her your cookie. I'm hungry.
Aria, face it.
that's why Ali's mom has been stalking us ever since Mona put on a straitjacket.
okay, let's back up for a second.
I get that Mrs. DiLaurentis is really scary, but I'm not buying that she's the devil.
I agree. - "A" knows Ali's alive.
if she knew that why would she waste her energy torturing us instead of bringing her daughter back home?
maybe because she thinks Ali won't be safe until I'm behind bars.
okay, you do need this more than I do.
look, I'm not saying she hasn't had help, okay.
I stayed at that house, Spencer.
Yeah, and you were almost kebobed with a knitting needle.
um, that was me.
I was there when she got the divorce papers, okay.
she's been through hell.
Yeah, and that may also be the birthplace on her passport.
I always knew she was a witch. Fitz is just confirming it.
Yeah, and we all know how much we can trust him.
where are you going? - Home.
and you're my ride. Can we please go?
is that Jason? - Jason. Jason.
what was that about?
who knows? When did he get back?
I don't know. But he totally saw us.
come on, hurry.
hurry. I don't want to lose him.
why would he just take off like that?
what's going on? It's stuck.
what's that? - What?
you know me, Spencer. You killed me.
it's not about money.
it's about getting wasted in a motel room.
I wasn't wasted, Mom.
the friend I was with was the one that was drinking.
which friend? This was one friend?
because your father made it sound like you were hosting the "Rolling Stones.
Yes, mom, it was one friend.
does this have anything to do with Mr. Fitz resigning from Rosewood?
how did you know about that?
Aria, what's going on?
nothing. I'm fine, honestly.
I just can't really talk about this first thing in the morning.
well, would it be any easier if I was at the foot of your bed?
but Jason's not answering, Emily.
he's unloading boxes from his car.
I'm just gonna walk over there and try to talk to him.
talk to you later.
you're up early.
Yeah, I have to go talk to somebody before school.
okay, I'll grab my jacket.
no, Dean, you don't have to come.
Yeah, I do. Your folks hired me to be with you at all times.
okay, I get it, but this...
my friend, you're gonna make him very uncomfortable.
why the pause? - What?
you paused before you said friend. How come?
because he's my next door neighbor, okay, and he's also my...
it's complicated, okay.
you're making it sound more and more inviting.
Dean, seriously, please. He just got out of rehab himself.
and if my sobriety-sitter tags along as a chaperone...
it's my job. - It's annoying, okay.
I'm not going to meet him behind a dumpster to cook meth.
I'm just walking next door. Can you just watch us from the window?
okay, fine. Where's the cup?
Spencer, I need a urine sample. That's the deal.
well, I'm tapped out.
Well...replenish and we'll wait.
don't touch that.
don't touch that either.
where am I supposed to eat?
right there.
shouldn't Mrs. DiLaurentis be doing all the work?
I mean isn't she the one hosting the stupid bridal show?
it's not stupid, it's for charity.
and Jessica's just a little distracted right now.
something's going on.
have you ever wondered why she offered you a job?
I mean you guys weren't even friends.
it's not like I had many after I checked out of cell block H.
I'm sorry, I just...I don't trust her.
and you shouldn't either.
she helped this family through a very difficult time.
and the least we can do is be there for her.
was the door slammed in your face?
no. He was just inside by the time that I got there.
what happened? - Dean and his obsession with my bladder.
well, I thought you were allowed more privileges.
you can't escape the cup, Emily.
Oh, hey.
when did you get back? - Late last night.
I was going to call you this morning. - But you didn't.
I'll see you later.
so does your phone stop working when you leave the state?
it was wall-to-wall family stuff.
my grandparents are needy and old.
all grandparents are old.
Emily... - You told the police.
you promised me you wouldn't and then you went ahead and told them.
I did it to protect you. - And who's going to protect Alison?
I don't think she needs any.
I see. So you totally played me and you got exactly what you wanted.
revenge on Alison. - This isn't about revenge.
Really?
she's been hiding for 2 years from somebody who tried to kill her.
and by you ratting her out to the cops, you just sent out a search party.
then let the cops protect her.
and what if they don't get there first?
well, she knows something's up with Ezra.
wait, you're not gonna tell your mom what really went down with him, are you?
look, Hanna, don't worry. I am not gonna overshare.
talk later, okay.
Hey, how's it going?
uh, it's going.
wow, I thought I had a lot of homework.
it's a job. The library, they hire a couple of students every year.
I'm gonna be late. Excuse me.
Hey, Travis, wait.
look, I'm really sorry about the other night.
it's not that I didn't have a good time.
I just...I've had a lot going on.
it kind of seems like you've always got a lot going on.
well, can we have a do-over?
you, me, tomorrow night?
we don't even have to call it a date.
we can just eat at the same time across from each other.
I can't. I'm busy.
Oh, okay.
I guess I'll see you later.
what are you talking about? People have to eat.
I thought we agreed to do finger foods before the speeches, Michael.
Ashley, check in there.
a seafood parfait is not a finger food.
no one wants to ruin a manicure digging shrimp out of a skinny cup.
figure it out, please.
Ashley, would you mind going upstairs to get the place cards?
they're in a bag in the guest room.
sure. - Thank you.
good morning.
may I come in?
now is not a good time. What is this about?
I wanted to give you an update on the investigation.
can we please just let my daughter rest in peace?
Mrs. DiLaurentis, we're not certain that your daughter is in that grave.
well, I am.
when you reported Alison missing, you gave the Rosewood P.D.a file of family photos.
one of them shows Alison as a young girl with a break in her right arm.
but the coroner didn't report any fracture in that bone.
then the coroner made a mistake.
well, the only way to know for certain is if we exhume the body.
that's not gonna happen.
I already have a judge's order.
I'm not here to ask your permission.
just to keep you informed.
she bought these yesterday.
does this look like a guest room to you?
I...
you've reached Mamma Gabusi's.
we are currently closed for renovations.
what's going on?
I just needed to get a paycheck reissued.
no, I'm talking about last night when you saw me and Spencer.
I had to get home. - Get home?
Jason, I haven't heard from you since I left almost half my body in an elevator shaft.
Yeah, I know. I felt pretty bad about that.
you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Wilden was after me.
wait. You think Wilden was behind that?
who else?
look, I know it hasn't been easy for you. And so does Spencer.
I mean we heard you kind of had a relapse.
but last night when we tried...
Emily, my mom's got a lot of stuff going on right now, all right.
I kind of need to keep a little space between me and Spencer.
Why?
because I need to keep a little space between her and my mom.
our family's already being harassed by the police, we don't need it from the girl next door, too.
I'm not excusing Spencer, but we both know your mom can be...
if you're expecting me to dump on her, it's not gonna happen.
going back to rehab a second time was humbling.
my mom was there for me.
well, maybe for you, but lately with Spencer...
Emily, this is not the first time my mom thought Spencer was messing with our family.
Alison, don't walk away. - I don't want to talk about it.
I want to know more about it. - I don't.
I want to know who did you... - Mom, drop it.
well, you can't just let someone walk all over you.
defend yourself. - How?
okay, I don't even know who they are.
well, you said there were notes. - They're anonymous.
are they on your phone? - Don't touch that.
is it Spencer? - No.
why not? You know, she's always been jealous of you.
and she has plenty of reasons to want to hurt this family.
what does that mean?
it means that I won't allow you to be bullied.
you fight fire with fire. Smoke her out.
spoken like a true debutante.
how long have you been sitting there?
so your mother really believed Spencer was after Ali.
look, I don't want to get into this.
my mom needs me right now and I'm here to help her.
so this bridal-thingy sounds like it's for a good cause.
do you want to be my date?
to Mrs. DiLaurentis' party?
no. No.
does a bridal-show bring up other issues, like Ezra and Maggie and their son?
that's not why we broke up.
who keeps calling? Is that Zack?
Yes. He won't sleep until we speak, and it is 3: 00 a. m.in Vienna.
okay, take the call.
you sure? - Yeah.
hello.
Yes, I'm sitting with Aria and she thinks you're a very persistent man.
how are you?
do you miss me yet?
spoke Jason. You're right Ali's mom definitely has it out for you.
Hello? Who's there?
it's just me.
getting some iced tea.
you sleeping down here tonight?
well, is that against your rules?
don't bust my chops, Spencer.
I think I've been pretty generous with you.
generous? How do you figure that?
well, I let you hang out with your friends last night and I'm not even questioning why your knee is buzzing right now.
go ahead. Answer your knee.
but you should be talking to me.
Why? - Well, that's why I'm here.
you're not sleeping and clearly you don't feel safe in your own house.
is that because your parents aren't here?
no. My parents are the ones keeping me up.
what are you reading? - A book.
why are your parents keeping you up?
because I have huge holes in my brain about the summer that my friend was killed and my parents refuse to fill in the blanks.
can we please talk about something else?
love at First Fight. - What?
it's a Jack Dempsey Story. He was a boxer.
came from a family like mine, where fighting was a second language.
sounds like that would put me to sleep.
I'll give it a try. May I?
are you making more tea? - No, I'm gonna go to bed.
what? I thought we were gonna talk.
Yeah, well, that moment passed.
Aria, what just happened?
nothing.
you went to Vienna and you found your bliss,
I stayed here and I got kicked in the teeth.
night. Don't do that. Don't push me away.
you're not even in this room, Mom.
you've got someone in your life who's clearly more important than us.
don't be ridiculous. Nobody comes before you or Mike.
Really? Where have you been?
honey, you were the one that convinced me to go with Zack.
you practically packed my suitcase.
okay, well, maybe I was wrong, okay.
and maybe you should have packed a little less.
your kids live in this country.
so are you mad at me or Ezra or yourself?
no, don't make this a teaching moment, okay.
Oh, but you will be very pleased to know that you were right.
and it was a huge frickin' mistake getting involved with him.
so send me an I-told-you-so card when you get back to Austria. Goodnight.
um, hello? Job description? Get up.
I'm sorry. I must have fallen asleep.
Yes, you must have on top of my daughter which strikes me as just a little inappropriate.
mom, what is going on? - That was my question.
but I don't need an answer. You can start packing.
I think this arrangement has lost its appeal.
what? Mom, nothing happened.
you can spend tonight in the barn, but tomorrow will be your last day.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'm sorry I didn't listen to my husband and hire the 60-year-old Scottish woman with the diaper breath.
mom. Mom, he was just reading to me.
you read perfectly well for yourself.
good night, Dean.
have you spoken with her since?
no. She's spending the day with Mike. How about yours?
disinfecting the house of all things Dean. Thanks.
look, have told her about Jason's memory?
Spencer, how are we supposed to trust anything that Jason remembers from that summer?
his brain was soaked in corn liquor.
Jason thinks that he saw CeCe that night wearing the exact same outfit as Ali, and we all know that CeCe's not the blonde that's in that grave.
so who ended up in that grave with the same clothes Ali had on?
Yeah, and if Mrs. D is "A," why would she be going after her own daughter?
she's not going after her.
ali still doesn't know who tried to kill her that night.
that's the whole point. Don't you guys get it?
the person who went after Ali could still be out there.
okay, if you guys have plans tonight, break them.
we're gonna put on wedding dresses for charity.
are you out of your mind?
my mom found a whole new bag of clothes in Ali's bedroom.
slow down. Mrs. D knows Ali's alive, Emily.
I mean if she's getting her new clothes, then she must know where to send them.
okay, but why does that mean that we have to go get married in her backyard?
because I'm betting that the address is somewhere in that house.
and we need a reason to be in there so I volunteered all four of us.
morning, Hanna. Girls.
Hi.
I'm guessing you told your friends about the anonymous tip.
look, I don't want to give you guys any false hope.
Alison's probably not alive, but if she is, after all this time...
there's going to be a lot of questions, starting with who's the dead girl in her grave.
if you guys have any thoughts, you know where to find me.
so what time does your mom want us to be there?
mom? What are you doing?
where have you been?
the Brew. Why are you going through my drawers?
when I gave Dean his final check, he said that you've been sleeping downstairs because you don't feel safe up here.
is that true? - Oh, God, mom.
why don't you feel safe?
is this about not trusting yourself? Is there some hidden stash of pills?
no, mom, I'm not the one who's hiding things. That would be you and Dad.
excuse me?
every time I ask you guys about that summer, you two put up a firewall.
how do you expect me to trust myself when my own parents clearly don't?
none of us want to re-visit that time. It was harrowing, Okay?
it was as if there were two of you living in this house, the Spencer we recognize and your evil twin.
and we never knew which one was coming down to breakfast.
that's why I made your sister promise that she would never bring up that incident that happened before she left for school.
what incident?
mom, what incident?
sorry, Mrs. Hastings. I was just cutting through to use our back door.
it's, you know, past my curfew. What happened?
nothing. I'm...I'm just...
I'm cleaning up.
did Melissa and Spencer have one of their fights?
I know a crazy scissors when I see one.
Alison, please, not tonight.
look, I can stay and help you clean up. - I don't want your help.
just...I want to understand this, and I can't.
what is happening to her? Why is she acting like this?
I wish I knew.
but if I ask her, she might turn on me.
go home. It's late. Your parents are probably worried.
you don't remember any of this?
right.
well, your father and I didn't know what to think when Alison disappeared a few nights later.
we've done everything we could to protect you, Spencer.
we know you're not a monster.
those pills were poison.
but you need to leave that summer alone.
please.
welcome to "Engaged to Change," a night to benefit...
OK, save it. I'm working this. Where do I park?
well, I'm not exactly sure...
I'll park it for you.
wait, you're working this?
you wouldn't catch me in a penguin suit if I wasn't.
I like you as a penguin.
is Jason even here?
if he came to help his mother, why wouldn't he be?
probably because "chiffon versus taffeta" isn't where he's most helpful.
we're never getting upstairs. - Why?
the house is event headquarters.
we're not going to be able to squeeze past Alison's mother without her noticing.
I'm lucky if I can squeeze out of this tent.
ladies, when you're finished with your touch-ups, please remember to check the list by the stage.
Spencer, what happened to your veil?
I think I must have left it inside.
go get it, please. Now. - Okay.
I just forgot my headgear.
look, Jason, I want to be very clear about something, okay?
I'm here to help Hanna's mom.
I didn't come here to get up in your mother's grill.
and I have been very shaky recently, because, I don't know if Emily told you, but, this time last week I was playing solitaire at Ferndell.
it's a rehab clinic.
I know what it is. Why were you there?
long story.
but isn't it funny that you and I always have more in common than we think?
I got to get this out to the tent.
wait, Jason, can I just ask you one thing?
you once told Emily that you had a memory of seeing my sister talk with CeCe in your backyard the night that Ali disappeared.
and you said that you thought CeCe was Ali because they were wearing the same clothes.
what's your question? - Are you sure it was CeCe?
could it have been another blonde?
sorry for interrupting. I...
Dean, this is Jason.
Jason, can we please talk later?
I just came by to say good-bye and give you this.
you know you can call me, 24/7. Y'hear?
thank you.
um... that Jason, now that was the same guy that you ran out to see yesterday morning?
Yeah. He's been gone for a few months.
he was at Clark Center.
he told you that?
Yeah. Why?
Clark Center's been closed for, like, 2 years.
be careful.
you asked your daughter and her friends to model the dresses?
well, we were short on time and they offered.
they offered or you asked?
I'm sorry, Jessica.
I really am sorry.
you guys, Jason wasn't in rehab.
what? - He lied.
where has he been all this time?
I don't know. Maybe in Rosewood, helping Mommy.
we have to get into that bedroom.
Aria, that's your cue. Emily, you're on deck. Where's Hanna?
uh, I think she went to the bathroom.
in that outfit? That's a lot of dress.
all right, girls, follow me. Come.
Spencer? Don't wander. You'll be up soon.
Spencer? - Coming.
Hey, have you seen Mrs. DiLaurentis?
I'll tell her you're looking for her.
I'm not. I'm just...I'm trying to avoid her.
okay.
you trying to pull off some kind of runaway bride thing, or...?
no, look, me and my friends are trying to get into her bedroom without her knowing.
so if you see her could you just, like, stall her?
okay. Well, I'm not sure if she and I have a whole lot to chit-chat about.
please. Look, we just have to get one thing and then we'll be out of there.
we've been trying to get upstairs a couple of times, but...
Hanna, is this the sort of thing that's eventually going to involve a police line-up?
Hey, can you help me back up?
Yeah. Just give me a second. - Yeah.
look, the thing is there's stuff I haven't mentioned.
you don't have to tell me.
you had me at "could you.
are you ready?
just bring it back.
keep it coming. Keep coming.
keep coming. Keep coming.
good.
dude, what the hell?
I am so sorry, man. That's my bad.
guess Mrs. DiLaurentis and I may have something to talk about now.
you're crazy.
you know, it's a little intimidating.
you in this thing.
well, get over it.
is the mother-of-the-bride allowed back here?
when I saw you on the runway, it took my breath away.
I was kind of glad your father wasn't here,'cause when he starts crying,
I start bawling and I would have embarrassed you even more.
you don't embarrass me.
good.
I know I may never get to hear what happened with Ezra, but I do know that he broke your heart.
and if I was to tell you that sometimes what seems like an ending turns out to be...
mom? I'm not...
I'm not ready to hear this.
when I met your father we were teenagers and I never expected to be with anyone else.
never.
but then one day, things change, and it's over.
and I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt.
it does.
but it's like a broken bone that's healed...
and still throbs every time it rains.
it doesn't feel like this is ever gonna go away though.
sweetie, it will. It will. I promise.
look at me.
I didn't even think I would ever find someone who would make me smile again, but I did.
and the reason Zack kept calling last night was because of you.
he wanted to know your reaction.
my reaction to what?
he proposed?
Oh, yeah, in two languages.
why didn't you tell me yesterday?
because I wanted to discuss something more important first.
you.
mom. Oh, my God.
where did your mom find the shopping bag?
in here. But obviously it's gone now.
Hey, Em. What's the name of that restaurant you called?
mamma Gabusi's. Why?
get your tablet.
look at this.
do you think that Ali's been hiding out here?
no, but it might mean something to her.
I have an idea.
this is the email address from the envelope.
I'm trying to get into the account.
it worked. Mamma Gabusi's was the password.
what now? - I'm sending a message.
Alison, you out here?
where have you been?
I was with my mom. Where is Spencer?
we thought she was with you.
it's blocked. Answer it.
Hello? How did you find me?
okay, Ali, the police know that it's not you. - What?
buried. They know that's not you in there.
Alison, does your mother know?
no, don't speak to my mother, okay? She can't know anything.
look, we want to help you, but you need to tell us what happened that night.
then you need to come here. And you need to hurry.
you guys, her phone's in here. That's why she's not answering us.
wait, do you think Mrs. D freaked her out and she left?
no, she wouldn't do that. Not without her stuff.
Oh, my God, are you okay? - What happened?
I saw Mrs. DiLaurentis in the woods and I tried to follow her.
what?
she was giving a suitcase to somebody. And I thought maybe it was Ali.
no, Ali's in Philadelphia. We just spoke to her.
Yeah. She told us where to go meet her.
what?
Spencer, come on, let's take this off. Let's go.
will you please help me?
Oh, my God. Are those finger bones?
what will you do when the rest of me comes out of the grave?
I'm outside.
did you get a jacket for Spencer? She's still shaking.
Yeah. Where are you?
gassing up the car. We'll be there in a minute. - Okay.
Hi.
Paige, I can't talk now. Aria's picking me up.
please hear me out. - I can't hear anymore excuses.
I don't have any. I came to tell you, you were right.
you were right.
I didn't just do it because I care about what happens to you.
I did it 'cause I don't care about what happens to Alison.
you're still so angry at her you'd let somebody kill her?
I love you.
please forgive me.
I do forgive you.
but I don't think I could ever trust you again.
what are you saying?
this does not look good.
good-bye.
what was this place?
are you sure this is the address Alison gave you?
Yeah.
this is where she's been crashing?
em, you okay?
look, it's probably a good thing you dealt with Paige before you see Ali.
it wasn't planned. - It never is.
Alison, are you in there?
what are you doing here?
I'll have the bellboy get your bags.
rosewood Police Department. How may I direct your call?
you need to walk in there and tell them everything, about Mona being "A," Shana taking over where Mona left off, all of it.
are we in agreement?
we can begin with the night that you disappeared.
I didn't disappear.
I was kidnapped and held hostage for 2 years.
I killed her, Emily, and I don't know how I'm gonna be able to live with that.
Shana had been using us as target practice for months.
I sent that text.
and you're gonna wish you stayed dead.
your mother can never know what you told me.
Mrs. D wrote that email the night that she skipped town, but she never sent it.
Jason, why were you in New York?
you think I'm the one who kidnapped her?
ARIA: Are you okay?
HANNA: Can we get you something?
Spencer: Something to eat?
some water?
jason: Just leave her alone.
Kenneth: I think you girls should go.
ARIA: But, Mr. DiLaurentis...
Kenneth: She's been through a lot.
Spencer: But... - JASON: He's right.
we should all get out of here.
do you want me to help you get dressed?
no.
do you think there are gonna be a lot of people at the funeral?
I don't know.
you can go downstairs.
I'll be there in a minute.
okay.
Kenneth: I don't want to see any police，not at the funeral, not at the cemetery.
no police, no press.
I took care of it.
did you?
Yes, I did.
Hey, how is she?
she's getting dressed.
Yeah, but how is she?
she's going to her mom's funeral.
how do you think she is?
she's going to bury the woman who tried to bury her.
question is, who buried Ali's mom in Spencer's backyard?
it wasn't Jason.
what makes you so sure?
because I saw his face when the dog found the body.
a dog who knows where the body was buried?
that sounds exactly like "A."
dogs dig. Okay? That's just what they do.
they just smell something and they dig.
you didn't have to mention the smelly part.
Aria, 'A' is gone.
you know that.
Yeah, 'A' might be gone, but we still have to deal with Mona.
she knows that Ali wasn't kidnapped.
got in Ali's face about it.
she's not the only one we have to worry about.
Noel Kahn?
he's going to do whatever is best for Noel Kahn.
that's not who I was thinking of.
HANNA: That's not the dress we picked out.
why are you wearing that dress?
I wanted to wear something of Mom's to feel close to her.
I got it out of her closet.
change it. - Dad.
Why? - Go upstairs and put on something else.
we're late now.
I just wanted to wear something of hers.
why is he so angry?
ali, your mother wore that dress.
I know.
she wore it to your funeral.
we should go.
come on.
coincidences happen.
Yeah, all the time.
they grow on trees, like coconuts.
just waiting for you to walk under them.
the four of you have had a very stressful week.
we're happy to be back.
I think we understand that.
as I told your parents, the school will protect you from the press and the curious.
we appreciate that, Mr. Hackett.
I need to know that you will do your part to keep the disruptions to a minimum.
you won't even know that we're here.
maybe coming back wasn't such a good idea.
we have to at least act like things are normal.
this is your idea of normal?
when we were in New York, Ali's mom was killed and now we're in one of Ali's biggest lies ever.
we can't pretend forever.
somebody's gonna connect all this to Shana.
Yeah, probably Jenna.
I'm more worried about the people who already know that Ali was lying about New York.
Noel and Mona?
and Ezra.
you know, somebody has to go talk to him - Not me. - Aria.
he's alive, he's safe, but we are over.
you guys can ask me to do anything else, but you can't ask me to do that.
I mean, it's not gonna take them long before they start punching holes in Ali's kidnap story.
to explain why Alison lied and why we backed her up.
real such as?
real as in who hit Alison that night and who killed Mrs. D.
we're all thinking the same person.
really, did you start reading minds?
Spencer, it has to be Jason.
I told you, guys, I saw his face.
Hanna found the email where Mrs. DiLaurentis was telling him she couldn't protect him anymore.
protect him from what?
he was the one who hit Alison that night.
we don't know that.
it makes sense.
Mrs. D saw who hit Alison.
and what did she do? She covered up the crime.
who else would you have done that for?
we should probably go inside.
she doesn't think that Jason would do this.
Jason's her half-brother.
she's going to take some more convincing.
do you want to do a trip to Philadelphia tonight?
what's in Philadelphia?
I want to know what's in that house Jason went to.
I can't tonight.
Why? Are you hanging out with Travis?
no. I have to be with Ali.
I have to take her somewhere.
where?
the funeral home.
welcome back to these hallowed halls.
Thanks.
Oh, I wanted to make sure I found you before all the good spaces were taken.
Mr. Fitz's get-well card.
you know what happened to him in New York.
Yeah, he was mugged.
he was shot, but he's back now.
so...
wait a second. What do you mean that he's back?
not here, not in school. In Rosewood.
recuperating.
you didn't know that part?
no.
don't you want to sign the card?
I think that you should, for the sake of appearances.
we all have to be careful how others see us.
I heard you were floating around with this.
are you going to give it to him?
maybe with candy?
well, they said that he was shot in the stomach, so I thought flowers.
Ah, good choice.
sign.
Oh, come on.
if she's still Ali, she wants to come back, pick up where she left off.
and look at that story she's got to tell.
all that drama and danger and suspense.
couldn't be more exciting if she made up the whole thing.
Hey, Mona, have you seen Noel Kahn?
Oh, I'm sure he's around somewhere getting into mischief.
she said that Ezra's back in Rosewood.
sorry.
I wasn't following you. I just saw you dropped that.
thank you.
I'm really sorry about what happened to Alison.
are you sorry about anything else?
I've had all the being-stared-at I can handle for one day.
I'll take care of it.
I know her. She's on the team, she just transferred in.
it's not important. Forget it.
nice having Emily back, isn't it?
you haven't signed the card for Mr. Fitz.
can I help you with something?
sorry?
people have been staring at me and my friends all day.
so why don't you take a really good look, and we can all move on with our lives, okay?
and, yes, I know the dead girl who isn't dead anymore.
okay?
I was just looking at your trophies.
my what?
the trophies in the case.
you're Emily Fields, your name is on all the trophies.
I figured out who you were when I saw you talking to Paige.
I'm on the team with her.
I'm Sydney Driscoll.
sorry for shouting.
I thought you'd be taller.
what?
I mean, you're tall, but I thought you'd be taller.
all the trophies.
I figured you had an advantage.
being tall helps, but not as much as everybody thinks.
they said you hurt your shoulder.
that's why you're not on the team anymore.
you must miss it.
I do.
listen, I transferred 3 weeks ago, I'm bottom of the roster and I can use all the help I can get.
what does that have to do with me?
watch me in the pool.
fifteen minutes, and then tell me what you think.
please?
don't let them catch you looking.
what do you think? Somebody's gonna throw a rock?
it's a possibility.
they hate us enough.
we're not exactly the Hatfields and the McCoys.
nothing so rustic.
more like the Borgias and the Medicis.
that ended pretty nasty as well, too.
a lot of matricide.
you think that Jason killed his mother.
well, there's plenty of pressure right here in this house.
why did you send Toby after me?
I didn't.
he went on his own.
why did you lie about seeing him in London when you hadn't?
seeing him and knowing he was there.
then on a practical level, why lie about it?
I was trying to keep Wren out of it.
mom and Dad are worried enough without me dragging him back into things.
and who do you think they're more worried about, me or you?
worry less about me, Spencer, and more about yourself.
you brought Alison back home, safe and sound.
good for you.
she's back in the bosom of what's left of her family.
now stay away from her and the rest of them.
I'm related to parts of that family.
and so are you.
and blood is thicker than water?
that's what they say.
it can also be very slippery.
he could have just dropped the damn visitation book at my house.
he said he wanted to meet you.
everybody wants to meet me.
God, I hate these places.
nobody likes them.
well, I hate them.
my mom always wanted me to understand the fragile nature of life
all these people I didn't know standing around crying, me choking on the smell of flowers.
I'll be right back.
do you want me to come with you?
I'm sorry you had to wait.
Oh, it's fine. It was only a minute.
thank you.
I only got back to town yesterday.
I spoke with your father on the phone.
you did?
I like to meet as many family members as I can.
that's why I wanted to give you that in person.
if I could have returned for your mother's services,
I would have.
my mother? I...
I'm sorry, that's Alison DiLaurentis.
are you Mr. Donahue?
Yes.
I apologize.
Mr. Thorpe told me that Alison DiLaurentis was here and from the description I had I just assumed that...
Oh, um, this is my friend Hanna.
it used to be a little easier to tell us apart, wasn't it?
mona: Sad, sad, sad.
how are you, Hanna?
I'm okay.
two months.
that's not good.
they say the longer someone's missing the less likely they'll ever come back.
where are your glasses?
I don't wear them anymore.
you look different.
look how pretty she is.
probably just put a blank space instead of a picture.
if Alison's really gone, someone has to take her place.
what do you mean, "If she's really gone"?
do you want to know the secret?
what secret?
the secret to becoming unforgettable.
let's go.
how long are they going to keep us out of the backyard?
the police still consider it an active crime scene.
what's gonna happen when the tape comes down?
how would you feel about selling the house?
I don't know.
think about it.
you know, when you sell a house, don't you have to inform the buyer of things like mold and termites and dead bodies?
Yeah. Life is full of sacrifices.
stay or go, we're finished with that family.
you know, Dad, we can sell the house, we can move away, but we will always be connected to that family.
and you know why.
sometimes complicated problems have simple solutions, Spencer.
Melissa thinks that Jason killed his mother.
that's for the police to determine.
well, it's not her job to point them in his direction.
what do you want me to do? - Stop her.
Spencer, anything that gets the police to look anywhere other than this house is a good thing.
for all of us.
you know, Dad, forget about selling the house.
we can just put a koi pond out back.
somebody already dug a hole.
so I have my own healthcare professional, Mrs. Esther Walling.
she comes over every day.
it's very nice.
she says that I'm her favorite gunshot victim.
look, I know I promised that I wouldn't come back here.
but I don't really have anywhere else to go.
how do you feel?
how do I feel?
I feel like a turkey that's been carved up and then sewn back together.
nothing really feels like it's in the right place.
my counselor says that's post-surgical mind-body dysphoria.
it's supposed to go away, though.
do you know everything that's happened with Alison?
only what I've seen on the TV.
she told the police that she was kidnapped and that you found her in Philadelphia.
is that the story you all agreed upon?
well, it's the story that she told, so...
and we have to live with it?
that's the deal?
Yeah. At least for now.
do you know about Mrs. DiLaurentis?
I know she was murdered.
and I thought Shana did it, but the timing doesn't really work out.
I had everything backwards.
but once I knew that Shana was following you and then I saw her in New York dressed like that, well, I knew she was 'A' then.
have you heard from her at all since you've been back?
no.
you have to be careful then, because she's clearly still out there.
in case Ali's kidnapper comes back.
you need to be careful.
all of you.
I better go.
Oh, that's a new lock.
let me get that for you.
thanks for coming and for letting me see you.
Yeah, I wanted to see you.
I watched your videos.
I'm trying to match your stroke rate.
my stroke rate won't work for you.
because you're taller than me?
no, it's not the height, it's your ratio.
of what to what?
well, what's your Ape Index?
my what?
stand up against the locker, touch the floor with your middle finger.
okay, now reach up with your other hand and stretch out as far as you can.
now stand up with your back against the locker.
it's about 3 inches.
your Ape Index is negative three.
should I be taking something for that?
no, no, it just means that your reach is 3 inches less than your height.
so?
so if you don't have long arms, don't copy swimmers who do.
Emily has great arms.
for swimming.
just adjust your stroke rate.
did you two spend a lot of time together?
training?
not really.
not one-on-one.
but we were together.
in the pool.
and out.
in and out.
of the pool.
right.
well, I'm gonna change now.
okay.
abracadabra.
now we have to do something about this, because you need a new wardrobe to go with your new silhouette.
that was Ali's.
she left it here after a sleepover one night.
try it on.
it's not gonna fit.
try it.
it fits.
like it was made for you.
see? Everything's better with a friend.
so what did he say?
he heard about the story of you being kidnapped.
And?
good. That's one less problem.
does he know... about Shana?
no.
it's better that he doesn't.
does she?
Yeah.
she could really create some trouble if you did.
Mona and Ezra know that you weren't kidnapped, Ali.
but Ezra doesn't look at the world the way Mona does.
Ezra's not a bad guy, Aria.
he's just too romantic for his own good.
that's probably why you fell for him.
okay, I really don't need you analyzing my personality right now.
here.
this is what you asked for.
keep it. Burn it. I don't care.
do you need anything else?
Shana tried to kill Ezra, and she would have killed all of us if you didn't stop her.
do you need anything else?
no.
Hey, you girls looking for a sub-let still?
no kidding.
you make a good watchdog, Arnie.
he says that you're a regular customer and a good tipper.
three pies, two, three times a week.
you feeding an army in there?
what kind of army orders all that pizza and no beer to go with it?
what do you want?
we're looking for a friend.
his name is Jason.
I need to make amends for something.
are you an old drinking buddy of his?
is that what this is?
this is where Jason came to get sober when he said he was at Clarke.
when was he here?
my dad's not here.
you're the one that I wanted to see.
are you leaving?
funeral's over.
mother's gone, Dad doesn't need me.
if anybody wants me, they'll find me.
look, what happened to your mother...
my mother had a lot of secrets.
too many.
that's what really killed her.
and Alison?
I come into this room and see her sitting at the piano or catch a glimpse of her going around a corner upstairs, and I think to myself this is what it's like to live in a haunted house.
I decided I didn't like it.
I think you need to look at this.
your mother wrote this the night that she died.
and it doesn't matter how I got it.
Oh, I got a pretty good idea how you got it.
if Mrs. DiLaurentis didn't send that email to Jason, then who was it for?
all we know for sure is it wasn't Jason.
he was at that dry-out place with no less than half a dozen people the night his mom died, and we were in New York.
so he's in the clear.
you sound disappointed.
no.
a little. I just thought that we had something.
what was it like to come out?
where is this coming from?
I just never really asked you.
I mean, what was it like to stop being one thing and then just become something else?
I wasn't becoming something else.
I was becoming who I really am.
you always knew?
I couldn't admit it.
but you knew?
Yeah.
not me.
I never knew who the hell I was.
that time stamp means that your mother wrote that 2 hours after the last time
and she never finished writing it.
she didn't even enter an address
maybe she changed her mind.
what would make her do that?
what would make you change your mind?
a message like that is something that I would want to deliver personally.
so she got up from her computer, she walked out the front door and she went to go tell somebody that Ali was alive and that things were falling apart faster than anybody could fix them.
too bad she never got to give the message.
what if she did?
maybe that person, the person she was writing to, the one that she couldn't protect anymore, maybe that's who killed her.
any idea who that could be?
Yeah, tons of ideas.
all of them pretty nasty.
there's a creaky saying you hear a lot at the meetings:
do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?
I don't have that choice.
I never did.
cut your losses, Spencer.
get out while you still can.
then remember, you can't trust him.
I can't trust who?
our father.
I'm glad you were on that roof.
you saved us. Thank you.
you're welcome.
we were scared that you were gonna die, Ezra.
so was I.
I'm glad you didn't.
why are you here, Alison, with that?
aria let me read it.
I was looking for something.
did you find it?
not all of it.
not what I need to know if I'm gonna stay alive.
there's more, isn't there?
all the watching, all the listening that you did.
you didn't destroy all of it. You couldn't have.
if there was anything left, the only thing preventing me from burning it is the possibility that it would help Aria, if she would let me help.
well, then you better keep it in a safe place.
did Aria know you were coming here?
no.
tell her.
absolute honesty?
that's all I got left.
I hope it's enough.
do you want anything to eat?
no, just coffee.
you're gonna have a coffee this late?
seven-tenths of my body is made up of caffeine.
I have to maintain a consistent level.
order for me?
hi there, girly-girl.
I need to ask you a question.
shoot.
metaphorically speaking.
when you and I were going through glamour boot camp together, you knew Ali was alive.
is that what she told you?
well, it's the truth, isn't it?
the point is she was gone.
that could either create a hole or an opportunity for you and me to help each other up the pyramid.
you didn't help me, you changed me.
you made me dye my hair, you made me wear her clothes, you made me walk like her, talk like her.
and exactly how much pushback did I get from you on that?
ali was gone, but you wanted her back.
Why?
reality check? You didn't like being Hefty Hanna anymore than I liked being Loser Mona.
how about a little gratitude?
gratitude for what?
if I hadn't given you the Ali upgrade, where would you be?
I'd still be me.
and who remembers her?
not even you.
and then Emily texts from the car that Jason has an alibi for what happened in New York and Rosewood.
wait. Jason actually told you that you shouldn't trust your own father?
more than that.
he made it seem like Mrs. D was writing to my dad, "I can't protect you anymore.
that's crazy.
well, crazy, as you know, around here works on a sliding scale.
I mean, look, I know that I didn't kill that girl in Ali's grave, I know that.
but I can't prove it and I really think that my parents don't believe me.
they wouldn't do anything about that, would they?
that's a very interesting question, and I will have to get back to you on it.
I'm so sorry you had to go talk to Ezra.
Yeah, well, we had to know what he was going to say about New York.
but somebody else could have gone and done that.
no, not really.
are you okay?
do you need anything?
Yeah, I need to know that it didn't happen.
Shana in the theater.
but it did.
Hey, I thought that was you. Wasn't sure.
Hello, Mr. Hastings.
how are you doing? You holding up?
I'm fine.
Thanks.
that's good.
I'm a little surprised to see you out here all by yourself.
I can't hide in my room forever.
even if I'm still scared I have to get out or else I never will.
Yeah, but you have police at the house, right?
I do.
but I know my way around this town better than any cop.
I can get out if I want to.
Yeah, maybe, but under the circumstances, I think it'd be a good idea if I gave you a ride home.
does my mom know you're out here?
she said I could wait inside.
I told her I was okay here.
your mom knows we're fighting.
we're not fighting.
we're done fighting.
which makes us what?
we go to the same school, we used to be teammates, maybe we'll be friends.
I practiced what I'm gonna say to you.
did you know that?
I talked to myself the whole way over here.
I'm pretty convincing.
then I get to this porch and I forget everything.
all I can say is, "I love you."
like if I say it just right, it'll fix things.
somehow you'll hear it differently this time and everything will be all right.
I'm sorry.
that doesn't sound very good.
I better go.
you deserve the best of everything.
where have you been at this hour, young man?
okay, hear me out.
pretzels that I will share with you if you don't tell your mother.
deal.
you know the world's in a sorry state when I have to make a secret out of eating salt.
Mrs. DiLaurentis wrote this the night that she died after she got back from the police station.
she never sent it.
I think she wanted to deliver it in person and that's why she's dead.
is this a magic trick?
are you going to make it disappear?
this doesn't mean anything.
every thing means something, Dad.
who was she trying to protect and why did she suddenly feel like she had to stop?
was it because Alison was alive?
who was she writing this to?
leave him alone.
we're having a conversation.
I know what your idea of a conversation is.
don't worry about that.
Oh, that's a grand gesture, but it doesn't amount to anything in a digital age.
this woman was crazy.
she was crazy and afraid.
enough! Both of you.
people are dead, you two are acting like cranky little 5-year-olds on the way back from the beach.
no more friendly fire.
have I made myself clear?
dad, maybe we should tell her.
no. Don't.
Spencer, go upstairs.
what?
go upstairs.
you've got to be kidding me.
do I look like I'm kidding?
maybe that's a good idea, Spencer.
what is going on?
it's complicated.
no, actually, it's simple.
you can't lie about something you don't know anything about.
I meant to warn you that Alison might stop by.
I just didn't think that she'd move so fast.
I just heard a knock on the door and I thought it might be you.
I don't know why.
I honestly thought I would never see you again.
Yeah, I was kind of thinking the same thing.
but here I am once again, back at the scene of the crime.
there's no crime here.
not the way I see it.
look, Ezra, I didn't just come over here to warn you about Alison.
I came here to tell you something that I should have told you before.
Aria, you don't need to tell me anything.
no, listen.
you don't have to worry about Shana anymore.
she's dead.
and I know that she's dead, because I'm responsible.
wh-what do you mean "responsible"?
I mean that I killed her in New York after I left the hospital.
I just meant to stop her. I never meant to kill her.
anyway, that's what I've been telling myself.
but it was just in that moment。
I don't know.
how can I help?
same shade of blonde this time?
no, not the same.
it's time for a change.
we've wanted this for so long...
a life without "A," and Ali back.
people are preparing for Ali's return and it's not with flowers and Welcome Home banners.
I'm going back to school.
and if we just stick together, everything is going to be fine.
there was still a girl in that grave.
someone killed her.
and Jessica was going to say that it was you.
I'm really worried that my dad tried to stop her.
you think that your dad... - Yeah.
and so does my mom.
I mean, she practically admitted it.
I can't stop thinking about Shana's family.
every time I close my eyes, all I can see is her grandmother.
you're just going to have to find a way to forgive yourself.
can't tell if this is Mars or a satellite.
do you have the coordinates?
like, business conservative? I'd rather wear vomit.
okay, but we have to find the planet so that we can study it.
look, there's no rule that says you have to walk into school with her tomorrow.
well, it's not written down but it's understood.
we're gonna walk down those hallways with Ali and everyone will think what they've always thought.
which is what?
that we're her puppets. - But you're not.
so who cares what they think?
Hey.
people know who you are, Hanna.
they do?
cause lately I don't.
EZRA: Are you still having nightmares about Shana?
I see her everywhere. Everywhere.
it's like she's haunting me for what I did to her.
look, all right, all right.
this isn't about Shana.
this is you doing this to yourself.
okay?
I wish I could fix this for you.
and I know it's silly but...
I keep waiting for that "A" message.
that picture doesn't exist.
you don't have to live in fear of your cell phone anymore.
no? Tell that to my right eye.
it still twitches every time I get a text.
what's she doing out this late? - I don't know.
since she's been back she's practically lived in her bedroom.
is this a date?
no. - No.
ali, what are you doing? Who was that?
Oh, my dad forgot my enrollment forms on his desk.
and he's stuck at home on a call, so his flunky dropped me off.
do you want me to talk to your dad?
good luck finding him.
he's avoiding me like the plague.
does Alison know?
what you think he did to her mom?
it's not the kind of information
so if action is character, then who is Alison now?
been reading Fitzgerald?
I've been re-reading Fitzgerald.
I already know Alison's story but I find it hard to picture her as a victim.
she seems really genuine when she says that what she's been through changed her.
and I want to believe her.
but you don't.
how can I believe a story that I haven't been told?
I mean, if the truth is in the details, we still don't know what happened to her.
Spencer, we wouldn't be us if we didn't believe in second chances.
it's Jenna.
I didn't know you two were talking again.
we're not.
I haven't talk to her since she moved to New York.
hello.
I'll be right there.
what's going on?
Shana is dead.
she could hardly get out the words, but Jenna said she was murdered.
Emily: I'm sorry, Spence.
okay, nobody likes lying to Toby.
but if he finds out what happened in New York...
just tell him the truth.
if you're lying to protect me, you don't need to.
it's your decision, Spencer. It's not hers.
Alison, you don't have to stand watch.
Spencer said that Toby was taking her home.
Jenna's not coming here.
he said she sounded broken.
she's still full-on blind, right?
Hey, no offense, but if she's sad she could cry in New York.
let's face it, we blinded Jenna, we killed her girlfriend.
she's back to punish us for it.
said with absolutely no tact but you're right.
I had no idea that Jenna was living in New York.
which means that Shana was lying when she said that Jenna didn't know that she was after us.
she came home to finish what Shana started.
and I still don't have time for a hobby.
what?
you guys have put up with so much to help me.
and I've made a lot of enemies.
but it's not going to be us against them tomorrow.
just like I'm working to earn back your trust,
does that include Jenna?
you can do this.
maybe she's not coming.
Oh, she's coming.
we should have picked her up.
why didn't we pick her up?
her dad wanted to drop her off.
guys, I don't think she's coming,
I think she's here.
girl: You guys coming this weekend? BOY: Yeah, I'm planning on it.
girl: Once a bitch, always a bitch.
boy: Hey, Ali, remember me?
do they love her or do they hate her?
I can't tell.
HANNA: Wait, Ali knows Cindy and Mindy? - Hey, Cindy. Hey, Mindy.
she used to call them "gayrons.
Gayrons?
Yeah, like gay morons.
so that's the Queen Of Mean?
I can't watch this.
you're leaving?
ready?
thanks for waiting for me.
ali, do you know where your first class is?
but I can't remember where it is.
I've got chem lab.
it's close. I can walk with you.
Thanks, Em.
well, I hope you have a good first day back.
Yeah.
call us if you need us.
we'll meet up for lunch, okay?
Thanks.
for everything.
I can't believe she's actually back in school.
as abnormal as this is, it kind of feels normal.
baby steps.
please report to the office.
please report to the principal's office.
mom?
honey, I'm sorry to have to do this at school.
what's going on?
we have to go home and pack.
what for?
I'm leaving your father...
and you're coming with me.
let's do something nobody else in this school is doing today.
let's talk about somebody other than Alison.
gladly.
I'm having a party so she can meet all my friends.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
what's she like?
see for yourself.
the party starts at 7.
can I bring Travis?
of course.
great. See you later.
is Melissa coming with us?
you need a jacket.
and that gray sweater that you love, let's bring that.
mom!
but right now I need you to stay focused on helping me get us out of here.
mom, I need you to be honest with me.
we're not running.
you pulled me out of school so that we could be gone before Dad gets home.
does he even know that we're leaving?
damn it, Spencer. When you latch onto things...
I just want to know the truth!
your father did take me to a spa.
but I never checked in.
I was working with a private investigator.
then the night that Jessica was killed, your dad and Melissa told me that they went to a diner in Ridgeville.
that was a lie.
you think that both of them...
I thought your father and I had an understanding.
we always agreed that, no matter what, we would never involve you and Melissa in all of the...
all of the what?
mom?
I want you to know that I'll take care of you.
we'll take care of each other.
Emily: Spence, call us back.
we're getting worried.
I haven't seen Ali since first period.
maybe they skipped.
no, Ali sent a text.
she's in guidance counselor hell.
with everything going on with Spencer's family,
I don't like not knowing where she is.
I was thinking about going to Jenna's after school.
I can swing by Spencer's.
okay, back up. Why would you be going to Jenna's?
because I believe what Toby told Spencer.
and if Jenna's broken because of what I did...
I don't know, maybe there's something
I can do to help.
what could you do to help?
Yeah, last night you thought she was staring blind daggers at you.
both of you, back off, okay?
I'm just saying, if she's not looking for us or smelling for us, then...
and I hope you have a carefree senior year, Em.
but I've got to find a way to live with what I did in New York.
okay, Aria...
I can be sorry for her loss.
all right? That's what I can do.
the glee club's sponsoring Frozen sing-a-long tonight.
I think I'm more of an Adele Dazeem than Idina Menzel.
it's free pizza on a school night.
you sure that doesn't trump 20 Questions with your mom?
is it okay if I hum?
I'll see you at 7?
Yeah.
I'm surprised you came to practice.
I heard you went home early.
I wasn't feeling well. But it passed.
are you sure you didn't leave because of Alison?
I know she's your friend, but even being in the same room with her makes me feel sick.
well, if you're staying out of school to try and avoid her, then she still has power over you.
then she still has power over me...
because I can't stand to be in the same room with her.
I hate seeing you so upset.
I'm fine. - No, you're not.
you're one of the bravest people I know, and I'm not going to let you forget that.
JENNA: Who's there?
is someone there?
do you want me to leave?
it's okay if you stay.
Paige?
it's up to you, Emily.
thanks for getting us together, Em.
Paige and I are both lucky to have you as a friend.
that's the only thing we have in common.
I am ashamed of the way I treated you.
I put people down to...
feel better about myself.
you are a terrible person, Alison.
and I hated you for it.
I didn't care if you were dead.
I was happy you were gone.
I'm sorry.
for what you did to me or for yourself?
for all of it.
you were actually the first person 'Cause I remembered how hard it was for you when your dad left.
God, I can't believe he'd risk everything to kill Mrs. D.
the police were asking questions about the girl that was in Ali's grave...
and he was just trying to protect me.
he thought Mrs. D. was gonna set me up to take the fall for it.
Travis is downstairs.
Spencer, I saw your mom at The Bradbury yesterday.
is everything okay at home?
Yeah, we're just having plumbing issues.
Ohh. Well, tell Veronica we're here to help if you need anything.
Thanks, Mrs. Marin.
Spence, you could have told her the truth.
not about the murder part, but about your parents splitting up.
she would never judge that.
I'm not really even sure why I lied.
I know that we've never really been like a warm
we're here for you, Spence.
I promise.
you want to order some food?
uh, I already have plans.
it's a school thing.
can I tag along?
I invited Paige.
so...
Yeah, I get it.
so I'm sure this sounds lame, but do you care if I stay for a little bit?
my dad's working late, and I just...
I don't want to go home to an empty house.
Yeah.
my mom's in the den if you need anything.
when I was talking to Paige
I realized that I owe you an apology, too.
I always made you think that your feelings for me
those kisses weren't just for practice.
I don't know what you want me to say.
you don't have to say anything.
why are you telling me this now?
I just thought you should know.
what are you doing here?
man: Hey, blondie, come hang out with us.
could you keep it down, Biff?
this is a coffee shop, not the locker room.
BIFF: You looking for a fight, man?
no, no. He's just a little bit irritable.
he hasn't had his coffee yet.
Caleb, when did you get back?
BARISTA: Two coffees for Hanna.
and... why haven't you called me?
better get your coffees.
Caleb, where are you? Why aren't you answering my calls?
are you mad at me?
can you just call me back so I can find you?
you dropped your phone.
thank you.
God, this punch is so tasty.
it's best consumed rapidly and repeatedly.
Cheers. - Cheers.
where is your girlfriend?
I...don't see her right now.
are you sure that she's even real?
Oh, she's real, all right.
Lucas, you're doing it with her!
okay, now that is consumed best rapidly and repeatedly.
whoa, you okay?
Hey, cowboy, where have you been?
I've been looking for you all night.
you're the one that's been on your phone all night, Hanna.
Aw, let me rub that bald head of yours.
okay, come on.
I think you've had enough.
actually, you don't know what I think.
you don't even know the half of it.
come on, come on.
Oh, there we go.
did I just say that you don't even know the half of it?
Mm-hmm.
here you go.
Bridget Woo just told me she saw Jenna tonight.
she's probably drunk.
Jenna or Bridget?
she also told me Shana's dead.
who are these people?
Jenna's a blind girl who used to go to our school.
her and Shana were dating, right?
I don't know what they were.
you don't like her?
Alison and Jenna hated each other.
my friends and I didn't realize we had been drafted into their war before it was too late.
too late for what?
announcer: Three minutes till show time, folks.
find your seats and your duet partners.
so are you Anna or Elsa?
I'm humming.
I knew it was you in my room today.
you scared me.
what were you doing in my house?
do you want to...
do you want to come inside? I can make some tea.
what I would like is an answer.
I heard about Shana.
so I was just coming to see if you were okay.
why would you care if I'm okay?
look, with Ali back, it's just...
it's bringing up a lot of stuff for everyone, and...
we all feel really terrible about our part in the accident.
I was... - Placating your guilt?
look, I might be the last person on earth that you want to talk to right now.
but for two years, we felt that Alison was dead.
so I know how it feels to lose someone.
right.
but you still have your friends.
I don't have anybody left.
right, but I guess that is nobody's fault but my own.
are you sure you don't want to come in for that tea?
I didn't really know Shana that well, but if you...
if you wanted to come in and talk and tell me about her...
I think that would help.
thank you, Aria.
you don't scare me, Mona.
you're not as good of a liar as you used to be.
I know you were all in New York the night Shana was murdered.
and I can prove it.
what do you want, Mona?
what I've always wanted...
and that's for you to leave town.
I don't care where you go or how you get there.
I want you gone.
I'm not a threat to you.
you may have convinced Hanna and the others that you changed.
and maybe you are trying to be a decent person, but that won't last for long.
people do change.
when someone shows me who they are,
I believe them.
I don't need to be taught a lesson more than once.
you're suddenly the victim of what, Mona?
my bullying?
what do you call what you did to those girls?
you almost killed Hanna.
no one feels worse about that than I do.
but I'm all better now. Even the doctors say so.
I don't believe you.
if you could prove that we were in New York, you would have done it already.
I'm back and I'm staying, so get used to it.
no one wants you here.
you're wrong, Mona.
just like before, everyone wants to be my friend.
and that's what you're afraid of.
all I had to do was say "I'm sorry" to Cindy and Mindy and they were practically begging me to sit at their lunch table.
you're scared because you know that it's not gonna take me long to win over your army of losers.
I made you Loser Mona once, and you know I can do it again.
we don't have to do this.
leave me alone.
Hey, Han, we're all at Ali's.
you might be asleep, but just call us when you get this.
I don't think it was a coincidence that all of you were busy tonight.
did you see who was driving?
it couldn't have been Mona.
she got into that church way too fast.
she had help.
sounds like an ambush.
you're shaking.
Hey, here.
well, what did you do when she slapped you?
I just stared at her.
look, I think you're right.
if Mona had any proof that we were in New York, she would have used it by now.
she was just trying to scare you.
well, she succeeded.
I would be madder than a skunk at Travis if he weren't as baffled by your behavior as I am.
when you sober up we're having a serious talk about consequences.
and yours won't just be a hangover.
okay, Mother.
but if you don't stop spinning the room, I'm going to throw up.
thanks for not being mad at me.
Oh, I'm mad at you, Hanna.
but I know you won't remember, so we'll talk about it tomorrow.
okay, Mother.
why would you do this to yourself?
Caleb's back.
Ali's really missing her mom tonight.
okay. I will.
she's okay with me staying over.
she said to give you a big hug.
you probably don't remember what I told you when I pulled you out of that barn.
I remember every word...
but I don't know what's real and what I made up.
you said you missed me the most.
you were the hardest one to leave behind.
look, I... I know that there's no more "A,
but you should seriously still lock your door.
you stopped by Paula's?
Yeah, it's key lime.
why pie?
why not pie?
Jenna's all alone now.
she's all alone, and she's blaming herself.
I just wanted to tell her that she should blame me.
you should both be blaming Shana.
she was the one that was holding the gun, remember?
ali, she always thought that Jenna was manipulating Shana, but I think that Jenna actually loved her.
look, Aria, you have to stop beating yourself up for this.
I don't know how I'm going to get past it.
do you see this?
this is what she did to me.
I'm lucky to be alive, and so are you.
just like she told you, remember?
Shana wasn't playing a game.
I'm so sorry.
Ali? Are you asleep?
does that hurt?
I can handle it.
if you feel as bad as you look...
not so loud.
so how does Mona know that we were in New York?
she's Mona.
but how did she send that "New York minute" text to your burner phone the night we got back into town?
what are you going to do with a satellite?
the point is that you can learn to do anything on the Web.
using a Bluetooth sniper rifle,
you can be blue-snarfed in seconds,
so Mona blue-snarfed us?
what's going on?
some people really did hope that you changed.
we're not afraid of you, Mona.
afraid of me?
what lies has she told you?
Alison attacked me last night.
I turned my phone to video.
you're scared because you know it's not gonna take me long to win over your army of losers.
I made you Loser Mona once and you know I can do it again.
it's...
that is the last time I underestimate that bitch.
how are you going to try and spin this one, Ali?
I mean, we know you're a great liar, so I'm sure this is going to be a good one.
everything I told you last night was true.
she slapped me first. I swear it.
I didn't tell you that I slapped her back because I felt terrible about it.
loser Mona"? Really?
are we back to that again?
I know how it looks.
but you know what she's capable of.
I mean, she set me up.
come on, guys.
I mean, Spence, you landed in Radley because of one of those elaborate stunts she pulled.
maybe Mona deserved it.
but you went out of your way to lie to us.
again.
nice car.
it used to be mine.
they don't want things to go back to the way they were.
they remember how Alison treated them.
like they were her dolls.
good.
then maybe we can really get rid of her.
so what does a world without "A" look like?
we can do that all on our own.
are you mad at me for waiting so long to tell you?
Spence, get over here.
all I want you to know is that you're never alone.
not even for a second.
I thought I'd find you here.
why haven't you returned my calls?
Travis is a nice guy.
I didn't come back to screw that up.
so why did you come back?
did you change your hair because Alison's back?
probably.
em, I know I screwed up.
em, will you look at me please?
why wouldn't you just tell us the truth?
it's so much easier than lying.
please.
that's not going to fix this.
news ANCHOR: There is breaking news tonight in the investigation of the Jane Doe who was buried in Alison DiLaurentis's grave.
we expect the Rosewood Police Department
did Miranda find her family?
I don't know.
the night you left Ravenswood was the last time I saw her.
you have to come with me.
we gotta go.
Caleb, come on.
TV: ...the Rosewood police chief - will be making a statement any moment now... - Guys, it's starting.
announcing the identity of the body found in the DiLaurentis backyard 2 years ago.
and this announcement is right on the heels of the more recent murder of Alison's mother Jessica DiLaurentis.
as these are not the only murders...
are they together now?
have you been drinking again?
I had one sip of beer.
woman: Oh, here he comes, we're going live.
we take you now to the Rosewood police chief.
police CHIEF: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I've called this press conference because we received confirmation tonight was Bethany Young.
she was a 17-year-old patient at the Radley Institution that Alison DiLaurentis was allegedly kidnapped.
did they just say "allegedly"?
the victim's parents have been notified to grieve over the loss of their loved one.
there will be no comments and no questions...
Oh, my God!
CALEB: What the hell was that?!
Ali: Are you okay?
guys, what just happened?
Oh, my God.
my God.
...your house.
was there anyone in there?
Toby, stay here! Please!
man: That's the last box.
welcome home.
DISPATCHER: All units in the vicinity,
please respond to an explosion at 47 Serenity Lane.
ambulances and paramedics are en route.
are you okay?
Hey, cowboy, where have you been?
I think you've had enough.
actually, you don't know what I think.
people are preparing for Ali's return and it's not with flowers and "welcome home" banners.
what are you saying?
I'm saying your friend hurt a lot of people, me included.
and I'm not interested in continuing that.
maybe she's not coming.
Oh, she's coming.
ali, do you know what your first class is?
mom, what's going on?
I'm leaving your father.
Caleb, when did you get back?
I don't ever want to hear you say you're sorry again.
Alison attacked me last night.
you're scared because you know it's not gonna take me long to win over your army of losers and you know I can do it again.
why wouldn't you just tell us the truth?
it's not gonna fix this.
I've called this press conference because we received confirmation tonight was Bethany Young.
she was a 17-year-old patient at the Radley Institution.
it's your house.
is anyone in there?
it's from "A."
CALEB: What does it say?
did you miss me, bitches?
it can't be.
Shana's dead.
Where's Toby?
I don't know.
will you please call me later?
okay. Bye.
well, what did Toby say?
nobody was inside the house.
thank God.
it could've been worse.
Yeah. Caleb's with them at the hospital.
guys, what does this mean?
that we were wrong about Shana?
that "A's" alive and knows that I killed her.
that's impossible.
we all heard what Shana said in that theater.
no, she never said that she was "A."
she never used those words.
she had everything but the letter painted on her.
em, come on.
we got a text seconds after the house blew up.
either Shana can cause explosions from the grave or "A" is back.
Spencer: Or never left.
well, what are you saying?
I think "A" took a nap and woke up tonight.
A's" been here the whole time just watching us, waiting for the right moment to resurface.
but why now?
that's what we have to figure out.
you look like you got as much sleep as I did.
I was with Toby until an hour ago.
how is he?
still pretty shaken.
I still don't get why "A" would blow up his house when we were all just three doors down.
"a" doesn't shoot and miss.
there has to be a reason.
did you see this?
wait, that's it?
they're not gonna look into what caused the leak?
I think you guys need to tell them who's behind this.
tell them what?
we don't have a face or a name.
Hanna, this isn't a game.
"a" blew up a house.
we can't.
it would unravel too much.
Meaning?
things happened while you were gone.
it's not the same as when you left.
I've noticed.
Caleb, I had no idea when you'd come back or if you'd ever come back.
I won't be staying long.
I'm thinking of going to Montecito for a while.
I don't want to commit to anything.
well, um, it's late.
I should probably get to school.
Shana wasn't "A."
I killed an innocent person.
Shana wasn't innocent, Aria.
Yeah, but the cops aren't gonna believe that when they find out how long I've been covering this up.
we don't know if this person has any idea about what happened in New York.
what are you doing?
looking for a connection.
a connection to what?
between Mrs. DiLaurentis and Bethany Young.
Why?
Mrs. D was on the board at Radley Sanitarium.
Bethany was a patient there.
you think that "A" killed Bethany and Mrs. D?
that would be a connection.
when I was writing my book, I interviewed some of the staff at Radley and I think the name Bethany Young came up.
I just don't know which file it's in.
okay, I can help you look after school.
Hey, hey.
we're gonna get through this.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
dad.
I didn't see your car outside.
it's in the garage.
why aren't you at work?
a little hard to concentrate when your wife and daughter are living at a hotel.
I have class in 10 minutes.
what the hell is going on?
you have to discuss that with mom.
we know that you lied about where you and Melissa were the night that Mrs. DiLaurentis died.
how do you know that?
what are you gonna do when the cops find out that the pills that killed her are in your medicine cabinet?
you think I did it?
I know that you were just trying to protect me.
damn right, I've been trying to protect you.
I didn't do anything.
neither did I.
then where were you and Melissa?
wait, they drove to the lake to talk?
Yeah, that's what he said.
have you talked to Melissa?
Yeah, I've left her like five messages.
your mom did the right thing by leaving.
Yeah.
it's Ezra.
Hey.
I'm with Spencer.
okay.
Yeah. Well, thanks for checking in.
I'll see you later.
he's trying to find a link between Bethany and Mrs. D.
has he found one yet? - No.
he's left messages for all his contacts at Radley, but so far nothing.
and you're going over to Ezra's place later?
Yeah.
I'm gonna help him sort through his files.
is that the only reason?
is there something going on between you two?
no.
then why did you bring him to Emily's last night?
okay, we had a slip.
a slip?
well, technically, it was two slips.
Oh, my God! Aria!
I thought you said that you were never gonna go there again.
I meant it when I said it.
are you forgetting about what he did to you?
what he did to us?
no, of course not.
you couldn't eat or sleep for weeks after you found out about that book.
okay, well he took a bullet for us, Spence.
Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that he deceived you for years.
Hey.
you okay?
somebody dropped their lunch tray and she practically jumped out of her skin.
so much for the new normal.
Yeah, I knew it was too good to be true.
too good to be true?
these last two weeks have been nothing but crap.
is Toby still at the hospital?
uh, yeah.
he's there with Jenna and her mom.
what's up with Caleb?
how long is he in town for?
who knows?
Oh, my God.
what is it?
Oh, my God. Ali.
I buried your mom the same way I watched her bury you.
"a" killed my mother.
who could it be? Mona?
someone working with Shana?
Yeah, or someone we haven't even thought of yet.
Spence, are you okay?
my dad didn't do it.
I accused him of murder, but he didn't do it.
well, it made sense why you thought he did.
unless your dad's "A."
I'm sorry, I'm just putting it out there.
no, he can't be.
and he thought that I killed Alison, now Bethany.
that still doesn't rule out your sister.
some things never change and now we're back to square one.
no, Ezra thinks that Bethany can ultimately lead us to "A."
okay, then we have to try to help Ezra find out as much as we can about her.
aren't we stretching a little here?
you have a better plan?
I can't wait around for answers.
I need to leave town now.
but you just got back here.
the only reason I came back is because I thought that "A" was dead.
if "A" wanted to kill you, why not just do it?
why play games and blow up a house?
I have no idea.
but I'm not sticking around to find out.
but if you leave Rosewood, then we can't protect you.
Yeah, and besides, it's not like before, Ali.
the cops are watching your every move.
the whole world knows you're alive.
even if you could run, where would you hide?
this is absolutely ridiculous.
I am so disappointed in your lack of cooperation, but when you change your mind, there's my number.
think. Give me a call.
okay? We're out of here. Let's go.
Eddie. Hi.
thank you for coming out.
I hope that I wasn't interrupting anything.
I have a few minutes.
great.
you look good. How are you doing?
well, well enough to stay out of this place.
did you hear about the Cavanaugh settlement?
I'm glad the family got some money.
they would've preferred the truth.
heard about Mrs. DiLaurentis, too.
Yeah.
I don't really think that it was a coincidence that Bethany Young was found buried in her backyard.
do you?
probably not.
did you know Bethany well?
if I did, I can't talk about it.
right. Okay.
do you maybe want to go get coffee later?
I can't talk about Bethany or any other patient not to the cops or reporters or you.
look, I know that you have a set of rules that you have to stick to and I understand that, but somebody very close to me might be framed for her murder.
so if you could just tell me anything at all, like if anybody from Rosewood ever visited her or anything, it would be such a great help.
I wish I could.
man: Eddie, you got a phone call.
good seeing you, Spencer.
Yeah.
I should never have come back here.
look, I get that you're scared, Ali.
we all do.
that's why you're staying with me.
you can't just babysit me forever, Hanna.
wait. Don't just open it.
it's just Travis.
I'll be in the kitchen.
hey you.
this is a nice surprise.
is it?
because we had plans to go to the Grille at 7: 00.
I know you weren't drunk when we made them.
look, I'm sorry.
with everything going on I totally spaced.
Travis, I would go, but Ali is in there and I really don't want to leave her alone right now.
she's going through a tough time.
I saw Mona's video.
looked like Ali was the one making it tough.
don't believe everything that you see.
and about Lucas' party,
I hope that I didn't do anything too embarrassing.
just on your phone all night trying to call someone.
I was?
I don't remember that.
but I don't really remember anything after the room started spinning.
figured there was somewhere else you wanted to be.
Yeah, in bed with an ice-pack.
so we're okay?
Yeah. Great.
I'll call you when Ali leaves.
okay.
later.
I don't know.
just get there, okay?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah. See you then.
who are you on the phone with?
doesn't matter.
well, it sounded like you are making plans to go somewhere.
were you?
I can't live in a world where I jump every time the doorbell rings.
so what? You're just gonna run away?
please don't tell the girls or try to stop me.
what are you gonna do?
say that you were kidnapped again?
do you think I want to live like this?
because I don't.
I'd love to stay, Hanna, but I can't.
not while that psychopath is still out there.
and don't worry, after I'm gone, you can go back to focusing on your little love triangle.
ali, wait.
I've made my decision, Hanna.
so have I.
I'm gonna help you.
nothing in this pile either.
okay.
that was a fun day.
look, Ezra, what happened the other night...
felt right, didn't it?
it doesn't mean that things can go back to the way that they were.
so what does it mean?
Oh, I'm not gonna pretend like I don't miss it, us, because I do.
I do, too.
Yeah, but then I remember everything that happened and how we met, all the lies that you told.
believe me, I wish I could go back and change things.
but you can't.
and the other night was a mistake.
evening, Mr. Fitz.
I'm Lieutenant Tanner, State Police.
mind if I ask you a few questions?
sure, yeah.
Oh, this was outside your door.
great. Thank you so much.
mind if I come in?
sure. Of course.
come in.
moving out?
Oh, no.
just getting rid of some old school files.
so what can I help you with, Lieutenant?
just some questions about Shana Fring.
Oh, I thought the New York detectives were handling that case.
they are.
but Shana was a former resident of Rosewood, so we're just helping them gather further information.
Yeah, I see, I see.
did you know Shana well?
uh, no.
she was never actually a student of mine.
hmm. Did you ever mention to her that your mother owned a theater in New York?
no, I never mentioned that to any of my students.
Oh, so it's just a coincidence that her body was found there?
it came as quite a shock to me and my family.
you were shot the night before Shana was killed.
that's right.
when we found Shana, she had some gun residue on her sweatshirt.
sorry, what was the question?
Oh, um, do you remember anything about your mugger, something that would help the investigation?
nothing that I haven't already said.
well, that's all for now.
thank you for your time.
Yes, of course.
well, let me know if I can be of any further help,
lieutenant.
I certainly will.
you need to give me those names, Paige.
the ones conspiring with Mona.
I can't tell you, especially after the way Alison treated her.
Mona altered that video, Paige.
even if she did, Mona didn't make her say those things.
Alison isn't sorry about the way she treated anybody.
she's still the same manipulative person she always was.
whoever blew up the Cavanaugh house is now threatening her.
I thought it was a gas leak.
someone caused that leak.
and you think it's Mona?
it's possible.
with a little help from her friends.
why would Mona want to blow up the Cavanaugh house?
that's what we're trying to figure out.
look, I know how you feel about Alison.
but could you live with yourself if something happened to her, knowing that you could've done something to stop it?
all your father did was substitute one ridiculous lie for another.
well, maybe you'd change your mind if you just talk to him.
I don't even want to look at him right now.
well, you're going to have to.
he at least deserves to know that you're gonna leave him.
unless you expect me to deliver that news as well.
Oh, great.
your father's here.
I asked him to come.
Yeah, I got it.
okay.
Thanks.
um, Noel's gonna pick me up from Princeton Station at 10: 00.
you're taking the train?
not from here.
I need you to take me to Newtown Station at 8: 00.
no. No.
I'll drive you to Princeton.
look, I want to make sure that you get there safely.
and my mom's out with Ted, so we can use her car.
Hanna, you don't have to give me so much.
you're right.
but I want to see my dad before I leave.
and I need to get a few things from my house.
well, I'll drop you off now and then I'll go get cash for you and just call me whenever you're ready to leave.
thank you.
you're really saving me, Hanna.
come on.
okay, we need to get these boxes out of here right now.
okay, let's just slow down a second here.
Tanner's probably on her way back here with a search warrant.
she's not on her way back here.
how can you say that?
I mean she basically said she knows that Shana was the one that shot you.
well, then why would she want to search my place?
cause she knows that you're hiding something, that's why.
well, she's gonna need a whole lot more than suspicion to get a search warrant.
if she does come back, she's gonna find proof that you were lying about how well you knew Shana and that Ali wasn't kidnapped.
I guess I could move this stuff into my storage unit.
wait, no.
no, because if it's registered in your name they're just gonna search that, too.
hmm, okay, let's just put everything in my attic until we find a better place.
my dad's in Syracuse until Sunday.
okay. That's a good idea.
Oh, what is this?
Oh, my God, I think that's supposed to be Mrs. DiLaurentis.
how can you tell?
I mean that's her house.
she was obsessed with her roses.
and she definitely wore scarves like that.
how many Bethanys do you know? - Just one.
and she was buried in Mrs. DiLaurentis' backyard.
Ezra, who would want you to have this?
Why?
my money's on "A."
I still have my security cameras up in the hallway.
Hey, didn't you hear me knocking?
no. Sorry.
Paige named names.
Lucas and Melissa are working with Mona.
and they're all after Alison.
Oh, my God. Have you told Spencer?
no, not yet.
where is Ali?
um, she went home to have dinner with her dad.
I'll go tell her.
No!
why don't you wait till the morning to do that?
this is too important to wait.
8 o'clock train?
Yeah.
I was thinking of visiting my grandma.
wrong direction, Hanna.
new Jersey isn't on the way to Oklahoma.
Ali's leaving.
no. She's not.
she was going to but I stopped her.
I don't believe you.
Emily, wait.
okay, fine. You're right.
how could you let her go without telling us?
it's not safe for her here.
like she'll be safer out there all alone.
it's what she wants.
what is that supposed to mean?
your hair. Your clothes.
Oh, yeah. And nothing's changed with you?
I saw you holding her hand last night.
she was frightened.
she reached for me.
what was I supposed to do, slap her hand?
don't you dare follow me.
woman: Let's go, ladies.
dad?
Hey, where are you?
no, I didn't get your message.
that's okay.
Yeah, don't worry.
um, I'll just sleep over at Hanna's tonight.
I love you, too.
Bye, dad.
dad?
No!
Oh, my God.
it's okay.
we're calling the police.
no. You can't do that.
and you can't call my dad either.
ali, someone broke into your house and attacked you.
exactly.
okay, if anyone knows that this happened, I'm never gonna be able to leave here.
look, if you don't want anyone to know then fine.
okay, but you're not going anywhere.
at least, not tonight.
mind if I come in?
sure.
Toby told me that I'd find you here.
what's up?
I don't know.
just wanted to see you.
something happen?
ali was gonna leave town tonight for good and I was helping her.
look, whoever killed Ali's mom is still out there.
I understand her wanting to go.
I realized I wasn't helping her to keep her safe.
part of me wanted her gone.
it makes sense.
you never liked who you were when you were around her.
I still do want her gone.
Hanna, whatever she stirred up inside of you is not gonna go away even, if she leaves.
I should know.
what did happen?
well, I hope you decide to stay.
you see anything yet?
just you, arriving at my door.
I can't believe you still have a camera in your hallway.
makes sense with all the research material here.
so whoever dropped off that picture
Yeah.
okay, now we wait.
you know, I've been thinking maybe you should tell Tanner the truth about Shana.
you know, that she was the one that shot you.
Where's this coming from?
Ezra, you lied to the police.
you could get into serious trouble.
but if I tell the truth now, they're gonna know I've been covering something up.
Oh, God, I hate that I dragged you into this mess.
you didn't.
I dragged myself into it when I decided to write a book.
Oh. Did you see that?
no. Go back.
do you know who that is?
Yeah, it's Eddie Lamb.
Eddie Lamb?
that's who Spencer talked to today.
I guess he's had a change of heart.
okay, but why leave it for you and not Spencer?
it wasn't "A."
whoever it was could've killed me and chose not to.
who would want to scare you like that?
your sister. - Melissa?
she's part of Mona's gang.
look, we don't know who it is. Okay?
it was too dark to see anything.
Oh, my God.
how could this happen?
it happened because she was alone.
Hanna wasn't with her.
where is Hanna? - I didn't call her.
she was gonna help Ali leave town tonight.
what? - What?
don't be pissed at her.
what happened is just more proof that I should go.
we're no closer to figuring out who "A" is.
that might not be true.
Eddie Lamb gave this to Ezra.
Eddie? Wait, from Radley?
Yeah.
what's it supposed to be?
it's a drawing of my mother.
we think that Bethany drew that while she was in there.
so they did know each other.
doesn't look like Bethany liked your mom too much.
Really? What gave it away?
was it the demon or the spear?
what did Eddie say? - He didn't.
he left it anonymously.
I don't get it.
why would Eddie leave that for Ezra?
one of us has to get in there.
I vote Spencer.
what?
you know the place the best.
I can't go back in there.
I was committed.
and her dad helped Toby's family win a settlement against Radley.
I think I have a way in.
see how easy it is for me to kill you?
if you leave Rosewood, I will. A.
I don't get it.
"a" wants you alive and in town.
but why?
what's worse than death?
I never thanked you for what you did tonight.
I didn't do anything.
you risked your life for me, Em.
it's getting late.
do you want me to take you home?
I don't want to be alone tonight.
can I stay here?
we'll just sleep.
I promise.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Hi.
Hey, I got you banana nut.
thank you.
is Toby coming?
no.
he wanted me to stop along over at the house to see if anything survived the fire.
Ah, that poor family.
Yeah.
Hi.
I'm with Spencer at the Brew.
I'll be there around noon.
okay. Bye.
is that dad?
it was.
are we moving back home?
Yes.
but your father's moving out.
we decided it was the best thing for everyone.
you both decided this?
I don't understand though.
I thought you said that everything went well, that you believed him that he was telling the truth.
I do.
so?
honey, leaving your dad isn't about one lie.
it's about years of them.
I thought you guys were happy.
we were.
some of the time.
no, honey.
I already have.
too many.
Hey.
Hi.
what are you doing for lunch later?
do you want to eat with me?
my treat.
I can't. I got things to do.
look, I'm sorry for not calling you back last night.
there was just... there's been a lot...
going on.
right?
Yeah.
I mean, with Ali back...
Caleb.
when I saw him this morning at the Grille
I figured that's why you've been so distracted.
that's not the only reason.
well, I'll give you one less thing to worry about.
Travis, wait.
I can't keep doing this if you're only in it halfway.
I like you too much for that.
you have a great school record and we are looking for volunteers.
but you need to know that our patients can be challenging, even aggressive at times.
I'm comfortable.
thank you for stopping here.
what's she doing here?
I don't know.
Hi.
good morning, girls.
is your dad home?
you just missed him.
he left for work a minute ago.
Oh.
is there anything I can help you with?
well, actually there is.
I would like it if you would come down to the station later with your dad and answer some questions.
about what?
your childhood friend, Shana Fring.
I still can't believe she's gone.
Yeah. It's so sad.
so much tragedy for such a small town.
if there's anything I can help you with.
I already did.
I was in Philly with the girls.
specifically where in Philly...
you know, that kind of thing.
well, you tell your dad to give me a call.
time for the caged bird to sing.
I asked Noel to break into Hanna's house tonight.
that's who was in the kitchen. It was Noel.
Hey, how's your mom? - Freaked.
guys, we needed to do that.
you saw Tanner cornering me at school.
she's trying to poke holes in our story.
your story. - Can you take this?
give each of the girls a copy. They need to memorize it.
you recorded that?
would you let me borrow one of those cameras?
Spencer: The camera is for my sister.
she's connected to all of this.
Aria, if you don't want me to get married...
it has to do with you marrying Zack.
was he inappropriate with you?
maybe he was with Hanna.
ali, where did that scar come from, the one on your thigh?
Caleb, this can't go on.
Spencer: I'm talking about Hanna.
she's getting wasted in the middle of the day.
Emily: I'm in Noel's car and he has pictures of Alison.
he put them in the same envelope as the tape he was listening to.
they caught him, the person who broke in here last night.
Alison, is that the man who kidnapped you?
what's his name? - Cyrus Petrillo.
how did you find him?
Mrs. Marin's neighbor reported a man lurking in her yard.
and he's admitted to everything?
his story matches Alison's.
the abduction, the blindfold, her escape.
I'm telling you the same thing I told Ashley Marin and your daughter.
not a word of this to anyone until we get enough evidence to press charges.
we need to make sure that this man is who he says he is.
lieutenant...
where is she?
it must be him.
is that him?
is that the man who hurt you?
I don't know.
you said you don't know?
what was I supposed to say, Spencer?
how about "no"?
I was blindfolded, remember?
there's a man being questioned by the police right now for a crime that never happened.
guys, this is "A."
I mean, you said he knew about the rock that hit you.
he knew where you were kept, what you ate, what mattress you slept on.
it's the same story that you told the doctor.
and Holbrook, the night we got back from New York.
well, it doesn't matter where "A" got it.
what matters is what "A" is planning to do now.
if "A" is behind this, that's exactly who that guy is gonna run to when he panics.
what are you saying?
we can follow him to "A" and finally win "A's" game.
great.
we win the game, we find out who "A" is.
what happens when we lose?
no, I don't need a creepy text to read the writing on the wall.
the second Ali says that this guy kidnapped her, we're gonna figure out that Cyrus Petrillo's a sheep farmer in Montana and couldn't possibly have done this.
and then the whole world's gonna know that Ali's a big fat liar.
and us. Right now, we're just as big and fat as she is.
Hey, guys, keep your voices down. - Yeah.
thank God the cops are here so we don't have to worry about being imaginary kidnapped.
they're gonna figure out about New York and Shana real quick.
Ali's not an idiot.
she's not gonna walk right into an obvious "A" trap.
we don't know that anymore.
we all heard her in there. She's gone rogue.
right, well, Emily?
Yeah. - Yeah.
Spencer's the convincing one.
Yeah, but you're the hardest to disappoint.
it's about your eyes.
awesome.
how's your mom doing?
she's heartbroken.
God, it's so awful.
I mean, first your dad cheats on her and then this sleazebag boyfriend hits on me.
Hanna, she was there.
she doesn't need a play-by-play.
I'm just sorry. That's all.
Thanks.
you need a ride?
Yeah.
what is that?
it's Noel Kahn's insurance policy.
it's everything that Shana gave to Jenna that proves that Ali wasn't dead.
ali knew it was out there, she just didn't tell us about it.
Tanner would sure love to get her hands on this.
Yeah.
ali talking to Shana when she's supposed to be dead.
you mean kidnapped.
ali doesn't know you have this, right?
no, but I'm headed to my house right now to stash it.
in your house?
is it safe?
I have a spot.
a spot?
that nobody else knows about.
well, maybe you should tell us where this is.
you know, just in case anything were to happen to you.
good-bye, Hanna.
Aria's right.
if you identify this guy, it will be way too easy for "A" to prove that you're lying.
we don't even know who this Cyrus person is or where he came from.
I get it, Em.
okay? I do.
but I can't just say that this guy is innocent.
why not?
ali, it's...
Oh. Emily, hi.
uh, I just got back from the station and, Emily, could I have a word with Ali?
dad, I already told her.
al, you were not supposed to do that.
Emily helped save my life.
she deserves to know what's going on.
the person you should be talking to is Tanner.
that man knew every detail.
how would he know that unless he did it?
he confessed already.
we're all here to support you, Al.
Emily, all of your friends, we all want the same thing...
to put this man away for a very long time.
Yeah.
we...
all want you safe.
whatever you're afraid of, please, don't be.
this man is behind bars and all we have to do is keep him there.
Yes, I know I just made the appointment, but the situation has changed.
no, I don't need to reschedule, because I don't need to book a banquet hall for a party of one.
Aria: Mom?
mom, you don't have to do that right now.
I just want to get it over with.
well, Mike says that you haven't eaten all day.
it's Pesto and mozzarella. It's your favorite.
it was incredibly sweet of you to make this for me, honey, but I just don't think I'm up to eating.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
I should have seen this coming.
I was too old for him, I was too trusting.
mom...
mom, this has nothing to do with your age.
this isn't your fault.
there were signs, Aria, and I just drove right past them.
because I wanted to believe that it could work.
I wanted to believe that he could change.
Hey.
you're the one that taught me that second chances exist.
your bliss is still ahead of you.
honey, when I said that, I was talking about Zack.
so...
okay. Well...
why don't you let me make the rest of these calls, okay?
the last thing you need to do is recount your break-up to a bunch of strangers.
how the hell did "A" get somebody to confess?
I don't know.
what's Ali gonna do?
whatever the hell she wants.
don't you think you should find out what that is?
Nope.
uh, I was eating that.
Hanna, what are you doing?
none of this stuff is good for you.
soda, beer, soggy nachos?
it's poison, Caleb.
when was the last time we ate a vegetable that wasn't battered and fried?
you know what? Enough trash talking my diet.
what is going on?
nothing.
just another day in the life of Alison DiLaurentis.
she's in the driver's seat of my life and I'm supposed to watch her just steer me off a cliff?
I'm sick of it.
okay, well then, toss her, not my fried zucchini.
you know, the other day Ms. Adinolfi made an announcement about chorus auditions for a solo and all the girls are freaking out.
then I thought, wow, what's that like?
to lose sleep over some stupid chorus audition.
I mean, is that what normal people do?
they go to football games and wave pompoms and freak out over a chorus solo?
normal people are not being hounded by "A."
besides, you don't care about that stuff.
well, maybe I should.
look, I don't know what I'm gonna do about Alison, but I am going to that stupid audition.
Hey, how'd it go with Ali?
Emily: Unclear.
Mr. D. kind of kicked me out.
did you find a place for the...thing you got from you-know-who?
you speaking in code now?
seems like a good idea.
Roger Wilco.
we still need a more permanent solution, but I've got a temporary one.
what are you up to?
avoiding the Brew as much as possible.
Zack went back to Austria, but the place is still tainted.
have you ever tried blue light cafe?
Spencer: No. - Good. Well, don't.
okay.
what's going on, Spencer?
it's gone. - What's gone?
the recording Ali gave me and the medical exam, it's gone.
gone as in "stolen" or gone as in...
no, this isn't code, Emily. It's gone as in "it's not here.
just give me a second, okay?
need any help?
I thought you left already.
we forgot the grocery list.
looking for something or just redecorating?
I just...
I dropped my pen.
what do you want, Melissa?
mom wanted me to check, see if you'd like anything special for dinner tonight.
take it. I'll wait.
Emily, I'll have to call you back later.
alison: He followed me into my yard and then he hit me with that rock.
next thing I knew I woke up blindfolded.
I can't sleep.
even now.
I can still hear him breathing.
something wrong?
just tell mom we're out of peanut butter, okay?
I'm really glad that we're doing this.
me, too. You good?
Yeah. Great.
are we almost done?
is that Spencer?
maybe we should just go back the other way.
it's a loop, Hanna.
when your mom said you were out on a run, I thought she was joking.
well, seeing is believing, Spencer.
Caleb, can you just give us a second? - No.
no?
no, we're doing a loop.
Hanna, this is important!
fine. Look, I just stayed up all night looking through the surveillance footage of my backyard, trying to figure out who took the recording of Ali...
okay, whatever it is, I'm just not interested.
you don't even know what it is yet.
look, I have to be at that audition in an hour.
I have to go. - What audition?
Hanna, are you seriously running away from me?
I'm faster than you, Hanna! I have a car.
Hey, just lay off, Spence.
what is going on?
you asked me to help Hanna.
that's what I'm doing.
Spencer: Just watch the bushes.
who is that? - Just watch.
she just gave him something, right? - Yeah.
that's not all.
watch what she's saying.
do it. Trust me.
do it.
when was this? - It was three nights ago.
less than 24 hours before Cyrus Petrillo confessed.
what, you think the guy in the video in your backyard is Ali's fake kidnapper?
that Melissa stole the recording and gave it to him?
I mean, we already know she's working for Mona, so why not "A," too?
cause it's gonna make my head explode.
that's why.
Oh, my God, do you think that Melissa sent that text?
maybe.
I mean, she always liked chess.
look, Aria, we cannot take anymore chances.
we have to cut the cord with Ali before she drags us down with her.
what are you saying?
I'm saying we use what we got from Noel.
the pictures, the conversations with Shana, 'cause they prove that Ali was alive and decidedly un-kidnapped for the past 2 years.
okay. And that helps us how?
we go to Tanner and we tell her the truth, that we thought that Ali was dead up until Ravenswood.
the only thing that we know about the past 2 years is whatever Ali told us, that she lied to us, just like she lied to them.
okay. But what about New York?
we can't just come half clean.
I know. But we tell her what happened there, too, that it was self-defense and you were protecting us. That's the truth.
but the truth doesn't amount to much when it comes from a bunch of liars.
Spencer, the whole reason I'm freaking out about this Cyrus thing is that it could lead Tanner to the theater.
and now you want to beat "A" to the punch?
exactly.
because it's better if they find out from us.
so what are you saying, that Alison might say this guy's guilty?
Yeah. She thinks that he's gonna lead her to "A, when really "A's" gonna make this whole confession lead Tanner back to us.
but she wouldn't do that.
she's crazy, but she's not stupid.
Yeah, I thought so, too. But a whole day has passed and this guy, he's still sitting in jail.
everything's gone, right?
the book, the research, the photos of Ali, all of it?
because if Tanner comes here...
Aria, you were the one that sent Spencer over to help me move everything.
remember?
she's very thorough. You and I both know that.
where is she?
who? Spencer? - No. Alison.
Why?
because I want to talk to her, that's why.
no. No, you're not.
you just got your stitches out, Ezra.
you're about to take a bike ride for the first time in God knows how long.
you just got the all-clear from your doctor.
you're okay again. You're really okay, and...
no, I... I'm not gonna allow you to jump back on...Ali's crazy train.
not with Tanner circling and "A" watching our every move.
no. - Aria...
no. Promise me you won't speak to her.
please.
I like knowing that you're safe.
okay.
okay, I promise.
how long till your dad gets back?
about an hour.
he's meeting with a social worker.
Why?
he thinks I'm afraid of retribution.
he thinks that's the reason why you don't want to ID this guy?
look, I know your dad is putting pressure on you.
okay? I...
I know he's convinced that this is the guy who took you and killed your mom and Bethany Young.
and I'm sure Tanner would love to wrap up all three nightmares with a neat little bow and you...
what about me?
you love that, for once, everyone seems to believe you.
that's not what this is about.
good.
cause, I swear, if you let some stranger go to jail because you're trying to cover your ass...
he's not a stranger, Emily.
who? Cyrus?
what do you mean "he's not a stranger"? Do you know him?
I don't know how "A" found him...
but...
he's the one who gave me this.
you were living with this person?
in an abandoned basement?
did he know who you were?
just that I was on the run.
he said he could tell that I was different.
special.
what happened, Ali?
he didn't want me.
he just wanted my stuff...my money.
and the way he looked at me...
like I was nothing to him.
worse than nothing.
I'm sorry, Ali.
but "A" is using this creep to trap you, to trap all of us.
"a" wants you to identify him.
you have to let him go.
you know that, right?
I know.
okay! Mona, we get it.
you can freaking sing.
okay.
next up, we have Jamie Demayo, and Mona Vanderwaal.
come on in, girls.
you were supposed to meet me outside my house, not in my room.
your mom let me in on her way out.
she made me some snacks.
carrot stick? - I don't want this in my house.
if it's not safe at your place, it's not safe at mine.
is that "A" again?
no, it's Noel Kahn.
he wants his loot back. - Okay, don't answer.
no, I have to. We might need him.
what if he has more pictures or information that we can use?
use for what?
to turn on our friend?
aria filled me in on your great idea.
it's not gonna happen, Spencer.
what we should be doing is burning this stuff.
ali is not our friend right now.
she's a dangerous person who has no problem gambling with our lives.
she's not dangerous, she's hurt.
I'm sorry, what?
she doesn't want me to tell you.
Oh, no, of course, she doesn't.
it's always the same with you two, isn't it?
just trust me, okay?
she's not gonna ID this guy.
she's gonna wait out the 48 hours and after that the cops have to let him go, - and it's all over. - And you believe her?
after all the lies she's told?
I do.
we're either all in this together or we're not.
Ali's not the problem, Spencer.
Melissa is.
she's the one that gave Cyrus the recording of Ali's medical exam.
I did my part, I talked to Ali.
if you really want to help, talk to your sister.
Mona, can you hear me?
what happened?
where am I? - No, no. Lay down.
Mona, you fainted.
you were out for almost a minute.
Where's my bag?
it's over there.
ms. Adinolfi is on the phone with your mom.
give it to me.
I need my bag.
miss Adinolfi: Your mom's on her way.
what can I get for you? Juice?
maybe some water?
how's your head?
anything hurt or... - Mona: Hanna, my bag.
you are not in this alone.
a lot of people have supported you, done whatever you've asked, gone along with all your stories.
is this a threat? - No.
right now it's an observation.
did Aria ask you to talk to me?
because if one more person tells me what I should do, I swear I'm gonna scream.
Oh. - Kenneth: Can I help you?
if there's something you need to tell my daughter, you can talk to me or with the police.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
I was just saying hello.
you okay?
was he bothering you?
it's fine, dad.
we don't have much time.
Alison, they have to release him after 48 hours.
now, I know this is hard, but we really have to go.
you know, I think I'm just gonna get a refill.
two minutes.
looks like you recovered quickly.
you followed me?
Yep.
whose car is this?
is this a rental?
you really go full out. - Hanna...
Mona, there was a mug shot of Cyrus Petrillo in your bag.
so either you set this whole thing up or you've been bluescarfing the inside scoop.
Snarfing, bluesnarfing.
and no, I didn't set this up.
I'm here to find out who did.
great. Me, too.
what does this thing do?
Hanna, get out.
look, Mona, we both know that Ali brings out the "A" in you.
so whether you're behind this or not,
I don't trust you one bit.
and I'm not leaving here until I find answers, either from you or that doohickey.
fine.
what are you doing?
if you won't leave, I will.
are you sure you want to do that?
where are they going?
what do we do now? - We do nothing.
Mona, we have to find out where they're going.
we have to follow them.
do something!
no need to follow.
I just got access to Tanner's phone.
Tanner: 170 to control.
transporting witness to 5th Street house for possible identification.
0. 013125
take off your seatbelt, Hanna.
we're not here to follow her.
we're here to follow him.
what did you say to her? - That her actions have consequences.
what about yours?
were you even listening when I asked you not to talk to her?
Yes, I was.
and you sought her out anyway?
I... I didn't...
here, let me just... - No, I got it.
okay.
I didn't seek her out.
I saw her, I made a split decision and I walked over.
right in the middle of town.
right in front of her dad.
and what if Tanner saw you?
once she figures out that you and Alison are connected, it is over.
you get that, right?
I'm sorry, Aria. I really am.
I was just trying to help out and the only way I knew how...
by lying to me.
by talking to Alison.
Yeah, the one thing I asked... - Because...the one thing I asked you not to do.
why are you this upset?
find what you were looking for?
you were certainly in there for long enough.
I was missing my blue sweater.
you know that one with the buttons?
I thought maybe it ended up in the barn.
any luck?
no, not really.
I saw your computer.
I know you're looking at flights.
London.
Zurich. Taiwan.
so are you planning a vacation or are you running away?
how is that any of your business?
I don't know, Melissa. Is it?
I know you're helping Mona, okay?
and now...
is somebody making you do something that you don't want to do?
are you trying to run away?
is this what it's come to?
searching each other's rooms, looking for answers to questions that we're too afraid to ask?
I only helped Mona because I wanted you to see that Ali hasn't changed.
she's as toxic as ever.
we both know Ali wasn't kidnapped.
but sooner or later, she is gonna get what she deserves.
and I do not want you standing too close when that happens.
so all of this is just sisterly concern?
is it really that hard to believe?
what did you do, Melissa?
and I'm asking you to your face this time.
I can't tell you.
not yet.
you're my sister!
does that mean nothing to you?
it means you should know that...
honesty does not come easy for this family.
okay, well, we can improve upon our genetics, huh?
let's at least try. - I'm trying, Spencer!
it is not safe for me here...or for you.
maybe you should come with me.
this is where he said he kept you.
the property has been abandoned for years.
not a lot of neighbors around either.
al, you okay?
Cyrus Petrillo may have confessed, but we don't have the physical evidence we need to charge him and our 48-hour hold is running out.
I know this is difficult, but since you can't identify your abductor.
I need you to try and remember this space.
come on.
I want you to meet my friends.
Cyrus: This is crazy.
Hey, guys.
this is Cyrus.
Hey!
my bag!
Hey, get off me!
you remember this place?
I can never forget it.
how long before they release him?
according to Tanner's emails, it could be any minute.
he could go out the front or the back.
well, I would say we should split up, but I wouldn't trust you telling me what you saw.
well, the feeling's mutual.
because I did.
since when do you have panic attacks?
since when do you get sauced before third period?
well, I'll say it if you won't.
since Ali came back.
why do you think I went on the offensive?
she scares me to death.
I just...didn't want to face her alone.
Hey, Caleb.
sorry, I haven't called you back.
the audition?
it went great.
but there were a lot of other girls there, so I probably won't get it.
um, but I'm just about to sit down with my mom for dinner so I'll call you after, okay?
okay, bye.
lying to your boyfriend again.
nice.
Oh, please.
like Mike Montgomery knows a single real thing about you.
Tanner: 170 to control.
witness has identified 5th Street House.
ETA to the courthouse, 8 minutes.
do not release suspect in holding.
I repeat, do not release Cyrus Petrillo.
I'm the one confusing things, Em.
I can't trust Ezra. I don't.
and people don't just change because you want them to.
Hey, can I call you back?
I heard that you went out.
what's in the bag?
my attempt to jumpstart my single life.
I may have gone a little overboard.
would you wear this?
Yes.
which is why you shouldn't.
I thought so.
so you're talking again...to Ezra.
Oh, that was just Emily on the phone.
but, yeah, we're... we're talking.
honey, I went through two boxes of tissues yesterday and bared my soul to you about thirteen times.
you can talk to me.
please.
I thought he was gone, mom.
really gone.
the whole time he was in the hospital,
I was just making up this list of the things that I'd tell him if I just got one more chance.
and now he's okay and I'm so glad that he's okay.
but I'm just... I'm stuck with that list still.
and there's all these thoughts and there's all these feelings
and I want to be able to trust him again.
just start over.
but you're right, people don't change.
Aria, honey, that's not true.
people can change.
I know because I've changed.
you've changed.
even your dad has changed.
your dad was the one who got me up off the couch this morning.
okay, it was the ricotta pancakes.
I know it's a small thing.
mom, you don't have to try to make me feel better.
Aria, listen to me.
I don't know what exactly happened with Ezra, but I do know that Zack is not gonna write the book on relationships in this family.
not if I have anything to say about it.
is that him?
ali, can I talk to you?
dad, I'll be right in.
okay.
you heard. - Yeah.
but I didn't understand.
you identified him?
ali, I thought we were in this together.
we are. - No.
we're not.
whatever "A" has planned affects all of us, not just you.
I waited as long as I could.
everyone was looking at me, being in that place.
you weren't there, Em. - When?
when wasn't I there?
when Hanna broke her leg because of "A"?
when I almost died in an elevator because I was trying to find out who killed you?
or when Spencer had to check into Radley because of everything your disappearance put us through?
the past several years haven't been easy for any of us, but what makes it okay is that we stick together.
we don't turn on each other. - I have a plan.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
the problem is you'll throw us all under a bus just to pull it off.
I stuck up for you against Paige, against Spencer, against everyone.
I wasted so much time on you.
I'm gonna make it right.
I am.
I can still find out who "A" is.
please.
I'm done, Ali.
I am so done with you.
if Ali identified the guy, then how did he get away?
once the clock struck 8: 10, he was a free man.
"a" must have had a getaway car out back.
by the time Tanner called in the ID, he was gone.
gone or not, "A" could still use this against you.
Yeah, I know.
but Spencer has a plan.
a good one? - No.
it's awful. Even for Spencer.
look, I'm sorry, Caleb. I shouldn't have lied to you.
I just...
after everything I said yesterday, I didn't want to tell you that I was in a car with Mona spying on Ali.
if it makes you feel any better...
I didn't exactly have a kale salad for lunch.
no?
try a bacon calzone.
give me a call if you need anything, okay?
I will.
I love you.
sooner or later, Ali's gonna get what she deserves.
that's what she said? - Yeah.
Melissa basically admitted that "A" has something terrible in store for Ali and us.
look, it's not too late, Aria.
we can go to Tanner.
we can tell her the truth about Ali.
God, no. I know.
you've mentioned that like 16 times already.
fine.
what are you smiling about?
it's just a smile, Spencer.
don't sound so concerned.
any word on Emily? - No, not yet.
you guys, I know I said that this might happen, but I still can't believe it.
ali walking into an "A" trap with both eyes open?
me neither.
are you okay?
you were right, Spencer. We can't trust Alison.
not after tonight. - Not you, too.
look, I know that this affects you more than the rest of us.
okay, I know that.
but I really hope you can get on board.
we need to cut ties with Ali now.
tonight.
I was beginning to think you might not show.
there's a warrant out for my arrest.
I barely made it out in time. That wasn't the deal we made.
you're lucky there was even a deal at all.
I should have left you for dead when I found you.
no one would miss you, Cy.
not for a second.
you know I could have told them the truth about you.
how we met.
all the fun we had together.
so could I.
then we'd both lose.
now we both win.
I found you once and you can bet your life I can find you again.
this is your one chance to start over, Cy.
you better use it.
the way you've used it, Ali?
Spencer, you're right.
I have to tell you the truth before it's too late.
man: If you're just joining us, you're watching the 42nd annual Pennsylvania dog show.
woman: Let's check back in with our...
I don't know what happened to you when you were away.
that's right.
you don't know the first thing about it.
not with Tanner circling and "A" watching our every move.
what we should be doing is burning this stuff.
Emily, Ali is not our friend right now.
Ali's not the problem, Spencer.
Melissa is.
we both know Ali wasn't kidnapped.
sooner or later, she's gonna get what she deserves.
we go to Tanner and we tell her the truth.
what about New York?
we can't just come half clean.
it was self-defense and you were protecting us.
I have a plan.
Emily: Oh, I'm sure you do.
the problem is you'll throw us all under a bus just to pull it off.
we need to cut ties with Ali now.
seems to me we've been here before.
we'll get it right this time.
this time is different.
after this, Ali's on her own.
wait.
that's when Ali came to my hospital room after Mona's party.
we can't tell now.
why not?
because no one will believe we didn't know Ali was alive if they see this.
Hey, you can't!
HANNA: It won't do any good!
Spencer, put down the brick.
put it down.
Hanna went to go check on Caleb and Aria went home.
here.
I can't drink coffee right now.
Oh, it's decaf.
I bought it for the whipped cream.
are you feeling better?
not better, less stupid.
thank you for stopping me.
save it for a real target.
what, "A" in the flesh?
that's one candidate.
what are you thinking?
we're all in this together.
I mean that could be "A" or...
it could be Alison.
or "A" wanting us to think it's Alison.
it's Alison.
are you going to answer?
I think we need to hit the mute button for right now.
Hey, how are you?
you are the one who held in there the longest with her.
I wasn't defending Ali.
I was defending somebody from a long time ago.
maybe somebody who never existed.
God, the thing I had with Paige was so genuine.
now...
can you fix it?
sure, yeah.
I can go up to Paige and say, "So you were right all along."
my bad.
let's kiss and make-up.
it's Ali.
maybe she's looking for us.
she must be nervous.
not as nervous as her dad.
he's taking her out of town.
he's worried about the kidnapper.
Ali's lucky that they released him when they did.
yeah...
real lucky.
don't play with your comfort food.
jeez, you scared the hell out of me.
what is this?
nothing.
I thought we had a deal.
it wasn't so much a deal, okay?
it was more like an understanding.
Yeah, that we would stop drinking.
it helps me when I can't sleep, okay?
why can't you sleep?
what happened with the police?
we never made it.
why not?
because "A" chopped us off at the ankles, that's why not.
and look, we can't be telling people we haven't seen Alison when there are pictures of her leaving my hospital room when she was supposed to be dead.
a" has those pictures?
we're back where we started.
we always end up back where we started.
go ahead.
I won't stop you.
can I talk to you?
mona: Everything about the Manhattan Project is fun.
it's the place where the Cold War started.
and J. Robert Oppenheimer is dreamy.
I don't think I can put that in the report.
hello.
Hey. Hello.
want some more hot chocolate, Mr. Mike?
uh, sure.
how about you?
no, thanks.
how could she identify a kidnapper when she was never kidnapped?
she knew him from when she was on her own.
the name he gave the police was Cyrus Petrillo.
have you ever heard that name, in all the time you were doing your research?
uh, no, I don't have much from when she was gone.
it's a blank.
but why would this guy confess to a crime he didn't commit?
maybe he knew it wouldn't stick.
maybe he knew Ali wouldn't confirm the story until it was too late.
Yeah, but if you're this guy, why would you even take that chance?
because somebody has something worse to use against you.
have you seen this before?
no.
where did you get this?
a friend of a friend.
I'll see what I can find out about Cyrus.
Thanks.
thanks for trusting me.
you're the only one who might be able to help me get the answers that I need.
I have to trust you.
well then, thank you for your honesty.
you need anything?
I'm okay.
well, Mike took Mona home.
dad.
Mike and Mona is a very bad idea.
well, he likes her and she seems to like him.
seems to.
but you know what'll happen if either one of us tries to talk to Mike.
Yep, he'll double-down.
so I suggest we keep an eye on the situation, but keep our distance.
I'll try.
okay.
Oh, your mom is coming back from Scranton in the morning.
and we have those tickets for tomorrow night.
I had my fedora re-blocked for the occasion.
just the four of us.
it's been a long time since we've done that.
too long.
your brother deserves way better than Mona.
boys hate it when you question their judgment.
if I try to tell Mike that Mona isn't what he's looking for...
you won't be able to separate them with a crowbar.
colorful, Em.
graphic, but colorful.
you guys, I had a bad thought.
well, why should you be any different?
share.
"a" doesn't want us telling the truth about Ali because they like to see us suffer.
not new information.
but who besides "A" wants to keep us quiet?
are you thinking about somebody in particular?
not Mona.
who's left?
that is a bad thought.
I got to go.
me, too. Later.
Hey, wait a second.
is this another bad thought?
do you still talk to that guy Dean?
my sober-coach?
not since my mom fired him.
Why?
well, do you have his number?
it's not for me, it's for Caleb.
what's wrong?
I don't know and he won't tell me.
is this about his drinking?
part of it.
you can't just introduce Caleb to a total stranger and say, "Let's talk about addiction."
Spencer, I have to do something.
I think there's somebody better for him to talk to.
sydney may be a liar, but she's a damn good swimmer.
I liked having her on the team.
she still is on the team.
that way we can keep an eye on her.
how does it feel, being back in the locker room?
feels good.
seems like the only place I see you is at practice.
I know.
it's...
complicated.
Paige, we need to talk.
maybe tonight?
I've got something tonight, but, yeah, we should talk.
okay.
do I call you Officer Toby or Cadet Toby?
I like Cadet.
sounds like you're in Space Command.
um, can you come over?
I need to talk to you.
no, it's about Caleb.
it will be easier if you're here.
it's always easier when you're here.
Thanks, Toby.
Bye.
are you sure about this?
Caleb will listen to him.
never underestimate the power of a good bromance.
it's from Melissa.
I'd recognize that anal-retentive handwriting anywhere.
what is it?
Melissa's gone.
Where'd she go?
I have to write this quickly.
dad's taking me to the airport.
I'm sorry.
you'll know everything soon. I promise.
why would your dad make her leave?
I don't know.
the note said that Spencer should know everything soon.
what does that mean?
it means what it always means.
nobody tells you anything when you want to know it, only when they feel like telling it.
and then they only tell you enough to make you crazy to know more.
has anyone talked to Ali?
she calls, but I don't pick up.
you guys, I had a bad thought.
I'm sorry, they just keep showing up in my head.
what's this one?
ali left town, but "A" said she couldn't.
what changed?
well, Ali made a deal with Noel.
maybe she made a deal with somebody else?
you're thinking she made a deal with "A" to leave town?
what kind of deal?
TANNER: Hello, girls.
lucky to get most of you at the same time.
I was hoping we could talk.
you're going to make an excellent authority figure.
where is everybody?
my mom is taking marathon depositions and my dad is staying at his club, which was something I only thought men did in old movies.
and Melissa?
I don't know, she may be back in Europe.
she may be at the Edgewood Motor Court.
the only thing I know for sure is that she isn't here.
Hey, when was the last time you saw Caleb?
um...
couple of nights after my house blew up.
I checked at the cabin to see if he needed anything.
how did he seem to you?
why don't you tell me?
Hanna stopped drinking, but he hasn't.
he says it helps him sleep.
maybe it does.
I think there's more to it than that.
you think or Hanna thinks?
he's different.
not in big ways, but just...
little things.
such as?
he looks...
there's a word that's lost all of its meaning, but it's what I think of when I see him.
what word?
haunted.
what?
it's not drinking.
it's something else.
what makes you say that?
because I saw that look that you're talking about.
I saw it when he came back from Ravenswood.
you're concerned about the suspect who was released prematurely.
I want to assure you, we will catch him.
that's good to know.
take reasonable precaution, report anything out of the ordinary, anything.
let us decide what's relevant.
we will.
Oh, I have been meaning to ask you all something.
who do you think killed Bethany Young?
who do we think killed her?
well, you must have thought about it.
how she was killed on the same night Alison was kidnapped.
um, I haven't given it much thought.
Really?
none of us knew Bethany Young.
I know that.
we haven't been able to find a single connection between you and the dead girl.
except, that she was killed 30 yards away from where you all were sleeping.
I just thought you might have talked about it.
I guess girls are different from when I was your age.
I think I'm going to be sick.
just hold it until she's out of sight.
Hanna, we're all set.
all you have to do is get Caleb to the Applerose Grille.
Tanner thinks we killed Bethany Young.
what... What are you talking about?
Tanner. She thinks we did it.
did she say this to you?
not in so many words.
how many words, Hanna, and in what order?
Hey, the front door bell's out.
could you please go get that?
sure.
Hanna, where are you?
and when did this happen?
at the Mermaid Cafe.
me and Emily and Aria.
she came up to tell us that they were trying to catch Cyrus what's-his-name, but then she ends up saying they're trying to connect us with Bethany.
there is no connection.
there wasn't before, but there is now.
we made it ourselves, when Aria got those drawings and you went to go meet a man about a horse.
Spencer, I don't think the police believe a thing that Ali is saying.
and they still think that we're the five Mouseketeers.
and I have Toby here.
just get Caleb to the Applerose Grille, 7: 30.
and then we'll talk then.
your sister isn't at the Edgewood Motor Court.
Spencer, you're right.
I have to tell you the truth before it's too late.
dad's taking me to the airport.
I'm going back to England.
he's been wanting me to go back since I told him what I told him in the police station the night you were gone.
maybe Dad's right and there's nothing to do but keep quiet.
but I can't just leave you.
not again.
not like this.
so I'm going to tell you the truth and you can do whatever you want with it.
maybe it will help you, maybe it won't, but at least, you'll know.
I saw you the night Alison disappeared.
I heard you fighting with her and I saw you.
I saw you with a shovel in your hand.
it felt like everyone who ever made the mistake of touching Ali was there that night.
what's that line from The Tempest?
this island is full of noises.
then I saw the body.
I thought you killed Alison with that shovel.
now I'm not sure what happened.
but standing there that's what I thought.
and I didn't want anybody to know.
I couldn't look at her face, so I pushed her in and covered her up and I didn't tell anybody about what I did or what I thought you did.
now I know it wasn't Alison.
and she wasn't dead when I buried her.
she was a stranger and I buried her alive.
because I thought I was protecting you.
our family has a gift for self-preservation.
but there's a point when you go from survivor to predator.
and I guess that's what happened to us.
good-bye, Spencer.
I love you.
okay, don't push him, Toby.
when I feel like Caleb's relaxed enough,
I'll tap you on the foot and that's the heads-up that I'm going to change the subject.
don't make such a big deal out of this, Hanna.
it is a big deal.
okay.
are you all right?
sure.
okay, he's coming, just play dumb.
he knows what I'm talking about.
so Hanna says you're having trouble sleeping.
what's the deal with that?
don't look at me.
this must be how boys communicate.
okay, what is this?
she's worried about you.
so is Spencer and to tell you the truth, me, too.
who died and made you Oprah?
so there is something wrong.
Caleb, Hanna's scared.
if you walk away, she's still going to be afraid.
do you want things to stay like that?
Thanks.
I didn't think you worked this shift anymore.
uh, I don't.
I mean I'm just helping out tonight.
are you going somewhere?
I mean you must be going somewhere.
Yes, I am going somewhere.
in fact I got to go.
okay.
have a good night.
Thanks.
Hey, you made it.
Yeah, sorry, I'm late.
your mom had to cancel.
lucky me.
man: Now, ladies and gentlemen, tonight's screening will be starting in just a few moments, so please silence your cell phones.
thank you.
they're talking.
talking is good.
what can he say to Toby that he can't say to me?
sometimes people want to tell you things, but they just can't look you in the eye and say it.
why not?
because they're afraid of what you'll think of them...
that they let you down...
that you let them down.
well, if you love someone, you should be able to tell them anything.
that's the theory.
it's human nature.
you go around this town tonight, you'll find a lot of guys who need to take the edge off to get some sleep.
why even gamble?
why not just deal with the thing that's ruining your sleep?
cure the problem, symptoms go away.
all due respect, you don't know what my problems are.
not true.
I've been there.
been where?
Ravenswood.
you were a tourist, man, I lived there.
and maybe you brought some of it back with you.
don't push this, Toby.
what are you so scared of that you'd rather drink than face it?
what are you so scared of that you'd push Hanna away?
you are crossing a very serious line right now.
do you drink during the day?
no, I cut that out.
Why?
because I got scared.
of what?
say it out loud.
I should have kept walking.
man: Hey, Miriam!
BRUNO: Is your name Miriam?
why, yes.
how did you...
excuse me.
man: Miriam, where are you?
Hey, Miriam, come on, stop fooling.
I promised you dinner.
Yeah, I just don't feel like I earned it.
you tried.
all I did was screw it up.
don't you run out on me, too.
I'm not.
I'm not running out on you.
I'm sorry.
I was... I was just mad at myself.
are you okay?
compared to what?
no.
Yes, maybe.
what was it?
it was a going-away present, a little "forget-me-not."
what was in the envelope?
I think it was the truth.
only now that I have it,
I don't know what I'm gonna do with it.
so this was taken 16 months ago at a branch off the Turnpike, near Donegal.
you can tell by the code that's in the time stamp.
if you have that code, you can find also some other interesting images.
also known as Cyrus Hart, Robert Hart and Cy Enfield, none of them solid citizens.
he's been arrested half a dozen times.
you have to know where to look, but it's all petty stuff.
no convictions.
I wonder what she promised him to get him to confess.
you seem pretty sure that that's what happened.
all makes sense.
at least the way Ali thinks.
it's a very special talent, one that causes a lot of damage.
man: Now when I nod my head, you just try to cry on.
I bet you can't do it.
all right now, just wait for the nod of my head.
she's been gone a long time.
you are very good.
you know right where to put the knife and you're not afraid to twist it.
Alison underestimated you.
look...
I'm sorry.
don't insult me.
you're right.
your dad should hate me.
he should throw me out of the house, after all the things I've done to you, the way I've treated Mike.
he deserves someone much nicer than me.
he deserves someone who is nice, which I am not.
maybe I should have just died when I fell off that stupid cliff.
don't say that.
Mona, don't ever say that.
I'm just trying to protect myself.
that's all I've ever been doing, just protect myself from her.
is that why you built an army?
maybe you won't believe this, but I'll say it anyway.
when she finishes with me, she'll come after you and the others.
she can't trust you anymore.
not after Cyrus and...
not after New York.
what about New York?
I know some things and I can guess at some others.
I have to ask you something.
what?
do you think Mike really likes me?
maybe Dad's right and there's nothing to do but keep quiet.
but I can't just leave you.
not again.
not like this.
you were always very good at leaving, Melissa.
you had a flair for the grand exit.
and there were times you'd walk up those stairs and I just wanted to applaud.
what's that line from The Tempest ?
this island is full of noises.
sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.
then I saw the body.
and you thought I did it.
you're the one who really killed her.
poor Melissa.
she was a stranger and I buried her alive.
because I thought I was protecting you.
good-bye, Spencer.
I love you.
good-bye, Melissa.
Hey, is Mike back from dropping off Mona?
not yet.
what happened?
we had a pretty long talk in the ladies'.
anything resolved?
well, what's said in the powder room stays in the powder room.
I think things will be okay with Mike.
I just have to keep an eye on her.
good.
who's that?
probably Lt. Tanner.
Tanner?
Why? What is she doing here?
she left a voicemail.
she wanted to talk to me.
about what?
that's what I'm going to find out now.
going somewhere?
I shouldn't have come back here.
but you had no right to pull some stupid intervention on me.
well, you're right about that.
so I came here to apologize.
but that was an hour ago and I changed my mind, sitting here in the dark, wondering if you were in an alley somewhere or wrapped around a tree.
I can take care of myself.
no, you can't.
what?
I said, no, you can't.
you think you can and usually you can, but this time you're wrong.
and you know it.
Caleb, I will fight for you, but you have to trust me.
if we don't trust each other, then I might as well just help you pack.
what did you want to ask me?
um, not so much ask, just talk.
I've been talking to all the parents of Alison's friends.
and you've been talking to the friends.
sometimes without any adults around.
I know the rules, Mr. Montgomery.
no one's trying to trick the girls.
they just need to know how serious this is.
it seems to me that you should be putting your energy into finding the kidnapper that you released.
a man confesses to a crime, then disappears the moment he's released.
what do you think changed his mind?
I have no idea.
this town ranks surprisingly low on curiosity.
well, we may not have a lot of imagination, but we expect the police to do their job.
I'll tell you something about homicide investigations.
if they start getting more complicated, you can be sure that someone is doing that on purpose...
someone smart.
and there are so many smart people involved in this case.
it makes my job very interesting.
you want to know if the police are interested in Aria?
we are.
she may or may not be involved in a homicide, but I'm certain she's part of the complications.
well, if you're so sure, why haven't you done something about it, instead of harassing these girls?
I wouldn't call it harassing.
I've just been waiting for one of them to step up and say that they are willing to tell me the truth.
and now one of them has.
and I expect to have a very enlightening conversation with her tomorrow.
I just thought you might want to know.
which one wants to talk to you?
Goodnight, Mr. Montgomery.
I'm not talking to Tanner.
neither am I.
well, I couldn't think it was you.
Where's Hanna?
I called all of you, but her phone went to voicemail.
it's not Hanna.
Oh, my God.
Alison.
maybe we can stop her.
how?
where did you get this?
Ezra.
who else was going to help us?
well, it's the end of Ali's kidnap story if we use this.
maybe.
depends on what "truth" she decides to tell this time.
I have to show you guys something.
I'm sorry I can't wait for Hanna.
they called it a pact, but what this town made was a contract.
with this preacher.
with what the preacher represented.
but contracts have loopholes.
so what did you do, you and the others?
we took the jars down to the bridge where the car went in the water that first night.
and we opened them...
all of them and released whatever was inside.
and what happened?
nothing for a minute.
then the woods were filled with fireflies...
millions of them.
they drifted up into the trees and...
they were gone.
Mrs. Grunwald called it "a great ascendency."
and after that?
no demons, no messages, no revenge.
and no Miranda.
she was gone.
then you kept your promise.
you took care of her.
I have...
I've spent this whole time trying to talk myself into that.
you did help her, Caleb.
and now you're back with me.
I'm not the same person that I was when I left here.
Yes, you are.
I know you.
you see this?
it's just a game, a toy. Right?
that's a lie.
this is real.
people turned it into a game and they forgot what it's really for.
they forgot because they were afraid of it.
Hanna, there is a whole another world, just right past the corner of our eye.
and I've seen it.
that's why you can't sleep.
I can sleep.
I just...
I'm afraid of my own dreams.
Why?
after she died, first time Miranda talked to me was in a dream.
I'm just afraid that she's going to show up again and she's gonna...
she's gonna tell me that it was all wrong and that she's not okay and that it's my fault.
but I'm not exactly who I used to be either.
Caleb, we'll get through this.
I didn't come this far not to have a happy ending.
good-bye, Spencer.
I love you.
I just got that today.
understood.
Melissa killed Bethany Young.
she thought that she just buried her.
she thought that I killed her.
she doesn't sound so sure of that now.
but the police think that we all had something to do with this.
when Melissa saw Bethany, she was wearing Alison's clothes.
another set of Alison's clothes.
there had to be a duplicate set.
ali wasn't walking around naked.
are you saying it was always someone's idea that Bethany take Ali's place?
we need to figure out a way around that picture of "A" at the hospital or we're busted.
what picture of "A"?
picture of Alison.
no, you said a picture of "A."
no, I didn't. Yeah, you did.
slip of the tongue.
Spencer, what are you gonna do with that?
Where's ali? spenser
she's gone.
I think I heard her scream.
did you see the paper today? - Yeah.
she's gone, but she's everywhere.
I'd like to know more about you.
I'd like to know more about you too.
so, I hear the new teacher is really hot.
holy crap.
somebody left a note in my locker.
from "A"? Do you really think it's her?
we received a call from Rosewood Mall security.
they have your daughter on tape shoplifting a pair of sunglasses.
first time? - Yes.
so I'm corrupting you.
we're meeting Melissa's fiancee. - I'm Wren.
that feels awesome.
we found your friend.
I knew she was back. Is she inside?
they found Alison's body.
it's Jenna.
Oh, my God.
it's from...
I got one too.
I'm still here, bitches...
... And I know everything. 'A.'
why was Jenna there?
I guess she's back.
that cop acted like we were suspects or something.
do you think we looked guilty?
why would we? We haven't done anything wrong.
except lie about the Jenna thing.
we promised we'd never bring up the Jenna thing again, remember?
it never happened.
have you found a way to forget?
I still wake up sometimes in the middle of the night.
it was an accident.
it's medicinal.
cramps.
I don't get it.
how does "A" know something about me that only Alison knew?
ali knew all of our secrets, but...
we never knew any of hers.
I knew some.
go on.
talk. - I can't.
Spence! No, you are not gonna drop a bomb like that and just clam up!
she'd so kill me if I told you.
she's dead.
ali was seeing someone that summer.
I knew she was keeping something from me...
from us.
well, why didn't she want us to know?
he was an older boy, and he had a girlfriend.
who was it?
she never told me his name.
that's only half the secret.
it's more than you ever got from her.
how is that Ali told us nothing, and we told her everything?
because she made us feel like we were part of something special.
we were.
I miss that.
me too.
I miss Ali.
I can't believe you still wear that.
ali still wears hers.
wore.
when Ali didn't come home that night,
I knew something terrible must have happened, but there was always some part of me that imagined someday she'd just show up.
Yeah.
I used to think that maybe she'd just...
run off with some guy.
she was laying on a beach somewhere.
or getting a tan out by the pool with that hot lifeguard.
Ohh. Yeah... what was his name?
who cares?
save me!
that's the last of the milk.
it's on the list.
over the area right now with a lot of warm air, but we've got a cold front moving in from the west right here behind me.
in other news, rosewood Detective Darren Wilden held a press conference this morning.
the coroner did release his findings this morning, and although Alison Dilaurentis' body did show signs of a blunt-force head trauma, the cause of her death was suffocation.
are you okay going to school today?
Yeah. I'll be fine.
I don't want to think about what the police are saying, and you shouldn't either.
try to remember Alison as the beautiful girl you knew.
I'm really sorry, mom.
for what?
the cop.
it's over. Okay?
we won't be seeing him again.
is that amber rose?
it's a good color for you.
I had to look twice to make sure that was Hanna.
right?
that was some funeral dress. Her mother didn't get that from curvy girl.
who shops at curvy girl?
no one, anymore.
do you not have time for breakfast?
no. I'm probably gonna be late tonight too.
late nights already? We just got here.
Yeah. What's that about?
what's it about?
being gone for a year.
playing catch-up.
faculty meetings. Changing my curriculum.
demanding students.
maybe your family's demands should come first.
I'm gonna be late. Love you, Ella.
what was that about?
you guys were getting along so well when we were away.
I don't get it.
well, you know, she's...
she's a teenage girl, Ella.
aren't they all Moody and unpredictable?
So...are you okay?
that... was a dumb question.
of course you're not okay.
I, um, I thought about going to the funeral, but I... I didn't know her, and it didn't...feel right.
no, I... I understand.
can I have a sip?
sure. Do you want your own?
I'd rather share yours.
you look tired.
I haven't gotten much sleep.
my mom found another one of Alison's boxes in the basement.
there were pictures of her in my room.
her room.
she's everywhere.
and that poster.
someone should take those posters down.
it hurts way too much to look at them.
I'm so sorry.
is everything all right?
mom, this is Maya St. Germain.
Oh, Maya. Hi. - Hi!
well, I would say welcome to the neighborhood, but...
it's kind of hard when your backyard's a crime scene.
still?
it's where people come to be close to her.
they light candles and leave teddy bears.
I get it, but it still feels like her house.
sure.
I can understand how you're not sleeping.
you know, Maya, why don't you just spend a few days with us?
you could sleep in Emily's room.
thank you.
nice!
so I hear you're gunning for varsity captain.
well, I have a shot, so...
if a Hastings has a shot, she takes the shot.
is that a drinking game?
Yeah, it should be.
Spencer, this is Maya.
Oh. - Yeah.
new girl who moved into dead girl's house.
can't believe I just said that.
Yeah, I can't believe you just said that either.
I think Brad pitt and I are missing the same sensitivity chip.
it's fine.
we're all trying to find a way to deal with it.
Maya and I are going for some caffeine.
do you want to join?
Oh, I'd kill for a latte, but, um...
this is my only time to practice, so...
we'll catch you later.
she's intense.
if you knew her parents, you'd understand.
can I talk to you?
Yeah, of course.
I'd like to transfer out of your class.
can you come inside for a minute, please?
Yeah.
I understand where you're coming from.
I just... wish that you could stay in the class.
this isn't an easy decision.
but I feel like it's the right thing to do.
I can keep my feelings in check.
I can't.
and even if I could, I don't want to.
it's too hard to sit in this room every day and call you Mr. Fitz.
okay? I can't pretend like I don't know you.
so...
will you sign it?
are you sure?
Yeah, I'm... I'm sure.
thank you.
okay,
I am all for boob jobs, but when I see those, I want to "moo.
I spy a Sean.
I'll see you at lunch.
what's wrong? - You surprised me.
we still on for the movie?
my mom invited Maya to stay with us tonight.
Ohh... what kind of jaimies do you think new girl wears?
how would I know?
I'll see you at practice.
will the following students please come to the office.
wait.
it's from "A.
dead girls walking.
so let's see...
you thought you heard her scream.
I... I said that, yeah.
and when you three woke up in the barn, Alison was gone, and so was Spencer.
Yes, I woke up before them, and I realized that Ali was missing, so...
so you went looking for her.
that's what happened.
I got that.
so, what's up? Was this a slumber party, or... ?
is this an interrogation?
no, just a routine follow-up.
why did you guys all fall asleep?
I guess we were tired.
tired?
really.
is that how you remember it, Hanna?
Yeah.
Yeah, you guys were tired.
look, we've told you everything we know, just like we did the night she went missing.
I know, and you see, the thing is, it's almost exactly what you said last year...
almost like it was rehearsed.
like Spencer said, we've told you everything we know.
he knows we're lying.
lying is not a crime.
it is when you're giving false statements to the police.
it's called obstruction of justice.
Oh, please! We lied about drinking.
but the truth that matters is we don't know anything about what happened to Ali that night.
we also know about someone who might have wanted to hurt her.
we should have told the police the truth about Jenna's accident the night it happened.
I wanted to, remember?
we had a chance to do more than just tell the truth.
we had a chance to stop Ali.
but we didn't.
and telling the police now about what happened to Jenna isn't going to make her see again.
it'll just ruin our lives.
Oh, my God, she's back in school too?
Hey, it's... it's Aria.
do you... want to come sit with us?
sure. Okay. Thank you.
so you're gonna be between Hanna and Emily, and Spencer's right across from you.
thank you.
Yeah. And here's a chair.
so...
this would be Alison's chair, right?
no. We're not even sitting at that table.
you know, she came to visit me in the hospital after the accident.
Alison did?
everyone misunderstood Alison, but I knew exactly who she was.
when did you get back, Jenna?
we heard that you were in Philadelphia, a school for the... visually impaired.
you can say "blind," Spencer.
it's okay. It's not a dirty word.
it's so quiet.
you guys used to be the fun table.
what happened to you girls?
I see you!
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!
who was it, Ali? What did you see?
he was in that tree, spying on us!
I am so creeped out!
who was it?
it was that perv, Toby Cavanaugh.
are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure!
he was right there!
I bet he saw us all naked.
should we tell someone?
I mean, we could.
but I have a better idea.
are we sure he's not in there?
he's not, okay?
you've got the lighter, right, Spencer?
let's wait a second.
what, Emily?
I don't want to do this. - Fine.
go back. You're on your own.
okay, maybe Emily's right.
we should just call the cops. They'll take care of it.
Where's the fun in that?
girls, Toby Cavanaugh is a freak, and we need to teach him a lesson.
if he thinks he can come and spy on us while we're in your bedroom, Emily, he needs to know that his little domain is no longer a safe little hideout.
who knows what he does in there all day, that little freak.
are you sure that it was Toby?
Yes! And it's a stink bomb, for God's sakes!
we're not nuking the place. Now, let's do it.
give me the lighter.
let's get out of here.
run ali, what did you doi Let's get off here! Come on, Let's go.
aren't you gonna get that?
if only she could see how guilty you look... A
okay, people, let's take our seats.
am I late?
it's... it's Mona, right?
that's right, Mr. Fritz.
what?
take your seat, Mona, please.
it's "Fitz," not "Fritz.
Oops.
if the mockingbird represents the idea of innocence, what characters are innocent?
take a second. Jot down your ideas.
we'll discuss.
what?
it's too hard to stop if we go there.
Oh, come on, Sean.
it's just us two. It's okay.
come on, Hanna, I...
you do like me like that, right?
Yes.
I mean, maybe you...still think of me as just a friend, the girl I used to be.
do you kiss your friends like that?
no.
look...I like the girl you used to be, just like I like the girl you are now.
is this waiting thing something you really want, or is it because of your dad?
no, it's me. It's...
it's my choice.
Hi, Mrs. Marin.
we'll submit the loan docs in the morning.
okay. Great. Thanks.
Hi.
how's the studying going?
fine.
please tell your dad we really have been trying to make it to church, but I've been working on the weekends...
Oh, yeah, no. I'll let him know, Mrs. Marin.
but it's okay. I mean, he understands.
he works on the weekends too.
cute preacher humor.
look who stopped by for dinner.
I brought thai takeout.
it's time for Sean to leave.
let's eat in the dining room.
I've decided on the class I want to take at Hollis.
but it's not for credit, dad, it's for fun.
what's the point of that?
your mom's coming back a day early.
she'll be home tomorrow.
Hey. I was gonna e-mail you when I got home.
how weird was that lunch?
I'd say on a scale from one to ten...
eleven. - Yeah.
is that the new fiance
is he as uptight as Melissa?
no one's as uptight as Melissa.
I'd better get back.
all right. See ya.
Yeah. Thank you.
can I get anyone a drink?
I'll have a vodka soda.
she's kidding.
I'm gonna have a glass of the house cab.
Melissa?
the same as my father.
I actually will have a vodka soda.
so I get your connection to Spencer.
you both like to win.
winning's great, but if I've done my best,
I usually feel good about the outcome, no matter what it is.
and Spencer?
Spencer needs to win.
Alison was always in the middle...
the center of attention.
how do you know anyone like that.
I usually run from those girls.
they scare me.
those girls"?
the queen bees.
you seem like a person who wouldn't run from anyone.
do you have a side?
sorry?
of the bed?
I kind of sleep in the middle.
I, um, kind of sleep in the middle too.
Hilow, anyone? - Hilow?
it's a game. You guys don't play it in bed?
Wren, you can play too.
I'm a bit lost.
you'll catch on.
I'll go first.
we just started our first week of class, and I've already been nominated to serve on the business school's leadership committee.
Melissa likes to play the game when she's fairly certain she'll win.
guess who I learned that from?
don't go tasting victory just yet.
because the judge ruled on my brief today, and the class action suit against winslow has been dismissed.
if I don't play, do I still get another drink?
Spencer...You're up.
I'll go.
I got a brilliant parking spot today, right in front of the chem lab.
he's just kidding.
did you have morning kiss? here's one from me. xo. A.
you're cooking?
morning.
over easy okay?
of course.
so, Maya, now that you two have slept together, you've gotten further with Emily than I have, what should I know?
good girls don't kiss and tell.
you don't strike me as a good girl.
shut up, Ben.
so, did you guys get much sleep?
cause I wouldn't have.
I don't know about Emily, but I slept like a baby.
coming, em?
um, yeah, I'll catch up to you.
Bye, Ben. - Bye.
we were just messing around.
what are you so weirded-out about?
get a room, Ben! And rock it!
em, come on.
looking good, Emily. You're looking good too.
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?
you okay?
not really.
you know, I never thought of you as someone who'd be so comfortable with PDA.
maybe I'm not the person everyone thinks I am.
who is?
it happened one night.
Mr. Fitz! Hi!
this is my mom, Ella.
Oh, Mr. Fitz. The new English teacher.
Yes. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Montgomery.
Oh, please, call me Ella. We're a very informal family.
are you going to see the movie?
Yes, I am. It's one of my favorites.
Oh, Aria's too. She's told us a lot about you.
although you forgot to mention the "you're very young" part.
we should get going. The movie's starting.
we'll see you inside.
see you inside.
and you forgot to mention the "really cute" part.
Mr. Fitz.
why don't you come sit with us?
uh... yeah. Yeah, okay.
I'm fine. Thank you.
you all right?
it's all gonna be okay. I promise you.
everything's gonna get back to normal.
I don't know what normal feels like anymore.
you've been missing her for a whole year.
you know, that's a lot to take on.
it's not just that.
I think there's something wrong with me.
honey, there's nothing wrong with you.
you lost a dear friend.
you need to find a way to say goodbye.
what about reaching out to the other girls?
have you talked to them? Have you told 'em how you feel?
in some ways, finding out Ali is really gone has brought us back together...
but it's still not what it used to be.
Why?
we were friends because of Ali.
then use her to get close again.
you guys need to find a way to say goodbye together.
still having trouble with that bursa sac?
I can't take you seriously when you say bursa sac.
shall I give you another rub?
no, that's... that's okay.
Yeah, it's late.
well, it's early for me.
I have a history test Monday and a paper due in Latin.
do you know what you said to me？
think so. Uh... "Up yours"?
Yeah. Okay.
that's the only Latin I remember. Can I help with anything?
what, with your extensive knowledge of the language?
Yeah.
you know, I didn't grow up in a family like yours, so I don't know that kind of pressure, but I can imagine it could be unbearable at times.
well, you're not exactly a slouch, Mr. Oxford.
I mean, that drive had to come from somewhere.
Yeah. It came from me.
my life has been my choice.
well, you're lucky.
I'm sorry. I'm being intrusive.
no, no. You're being nice.
gehry said that the "hat trick" chair was inspired by an apple crate.
I didn't realize that you were into design.
Yeah.
and I appreciate beauty.
stop. Stop.
we can't...
you can't do this. It's not right.
this sounds totally gay, but if I saw you struttin' it in that dress and kickin' up those heels,
I would think about doing you.
and we love the necklace?
we adore it.
relax. You actually paid for that.
let's go.
um, yeah. I'll be right back.
are you spying on me?
just doing my job.
look, I'll pay for the sunglasses. I'll pick up trash on the highway.
I'll do whatever it takes, but I want you to leave my mother alone.
you see, the thing is, Hanna,
I don't care if you were drinking the night Alison went missing.
what I care about is you and your pretty little friends knowing who killed her.
what?
your mom may be hot, Hanna, but she's not hot enough to make that go away.
I got you guys something.
what's the occasion?
you'll see. Open 'em.
we'll be friends forever.
can you put mine on for me, em?
we need to talk.
you can't keep doing this.
you're not very good at hiding your feelings.
and your mother knows that something is up.
look, Aria,
I don't like to lie, but sometimes telling the truth does more harm than good.
now, when we were in Iceland, you found a way to let go of what happened.
are you seeing her again?
she teaches at Hollis, so I do see her, but not like that.
were you in love with her?
I had very strong feelings for Meredith, and my attraction to her took me completely by surprise.
I had no intention of being unfaithful to your mother.
and you're too young to understand this, but...
the truth is,
I gave in to my emotions.
Mr. Chung was very happy to see us.
from the looks of all of this food,
I'm sure that he was.
we got you kung pao.
you're... you're not going out tonight?
no.
no, I think I'll stay home.
I like the sound of that.
is this good? - Mm, yeah.
you want some? - Yeah, thanks.
I'm gonna go get out of these wet clothes, okay?
is it good?
try this? - No, thanks. I'm good.
you're good? - I'm good.
you're sure? - I am good.
I think I got too much food. -That's fine.
when students kiss teachers, someone gets hurt. that's a promise i'll keep.
send text now.
do you have plans this weekend?
I'm thinking we should talk about the homework assignment.
I know that you're not crazy about having me for a lab partner.
it's okay.
any guy at this party would be happy to be with me.
we've already talked about this, okay?
why are you taking sean's car? Hanna!
you will work off the cost of repairs in sean's mother's office.
what's a golden orchid?
it's a national competition for historical writing.
more academic bling for spencer.
I saw the way you were looking at my dad yesterday.
I have eyes. Find someone who's available. My dad isn't.
mom, there's something you should know.
somebody's been in the house.
this is the letter A sent to my mom.
you know it's not your fault, right?
it's your dad's mistake, totally.
no, it is my fault.
you did not hook up with her
and then ask your kid to cover for you.
ali said i should've told my mom right after it happened.
Ali? Alison knew?
Yeah, she was with me.
so, Alison saw this meredith person?
Meredith? Her name is meredith.
EW. That's not even a cute-Girl name.
I'm seeing big pores and mousy roots.
Hanna, I think it's a little too soon to joke.
I'm sorry, but if you're gonna cheat.
you might as well do it with somebody who deep-Conditions her hair occasionally.
here, put something in your mouth.
besides your foot.
I'm sorry. Okay?
look, all I'm saying is that when my dad left.
laughing sometimes helped.
so did crying.
my father hasn't left, guys.
I mean, this happened over a year ago.
you think he's gonna leave?
look, whatever happens, we're here for you.
thank you guys for staying here.
I couldn't have been here alone.
when's your family getting back?
this afternoon.
weren't you gonna clean off the mirror before they get here?
want me to come with?
we should all go.
uh, yeah, you know what?
it doesn't take four of us to clean a mirror.
so why don't you three go, and I'll just wait here.
fine. You stay down here. Alone.
but make sure you lock the door.
great. You spray, I'll wipe.
well, the creature's back.
we should've never unblocked our phone.
open the attachment.
that's us!
was that shot from inside your closet?
"a" was watching us!
guys.
check it out.
how do you not poke your eyeball?
what's up?
uh, nothing.
look, um...are mom and dad acting weird with each other?
what do you mean?
I mean, I don't know.
there's a vibe.
Yeah, maybe.
look, don't worry about it, okay?
you're only gonna do one eye?
is that a new cyclops look?
listen, I can take them to practice if you want.
I can do it. - Well, I'm done by 3: 00.
I'll do it.
should we find someone to talk to?
a counselor, therapist?
you would feel more comfortable talking to a stranger.
in some office than you would in your own kitchen?
Yeah, but we're not talking, Ella.
are you done with this?
see you later.
Bye.
see ya.
all right, tell me what I need to do to make this better.
do you want me to move out?
don't make that my decision.
well, do you think it would help?
how, by making me deal with their confusion alone, or by making me the bad guy that kicked their dad out?
are they gonna be any less confused seeing
us walk around here like sulky roommates?
we're not...
do you want some breakfast? There's yogurt.
no, i'm-- I'm good with a granola bar.
I'm going to, uh, going to go to work. I've got office hours.
Hey, good luck with that french test, sweetheart.
look, Mike knows something's up.
are you gonna tell him?
Yeah. You know, when I can.
okay, well, just don't wait too long.
it was way too hard to keep it from you for a year.
I don't want to have to do that to him, too.
a year? You've known about this for a year?
Yeah. I thought dad...he didn't tell you that he asked me to--?
mom, I can miss first period if you want to talk.
it's okay.
this is between me and your dad.
don't worry.
need some help?
Oh, hi. Hey.
no, no, I got it.
um, stupid shoe.
my mom forgot to mention the new job required a uniform, huh?
no, it's cool. I like it. Hideous looks good on me.
listen, I tried-- I know that.
sorry. What were you gonna say?
I tried to take the fall for the car.
you did? Why?
I felt really bad about what went down at noel's party.
so I told my parents i gave you the keys.
and I'd pay for the repairs.
no. No, I should pay for the repairs.
it was my fault.
besides, I think working in a dentist office
will help me with my fear.
scared of dentists? - Children.
your mom is making me hand out suga r-Free lollypops to six-Year-Olds.
they don't bite at that age, do they?
look, I know that we haven't talked since that night.
but since we are now.
do you wanna talk about homecoming?
I mean, do you still wanna go?
you know, with me?
I, uh, hadn't really thought about it.
coach has us on a lot of two-A-Days.
that's a lot of pressure.
and with everything else going on, I just...
Yeah, no, I get it. - No, well, we...
we should. Talk about it.
I gotta go. That's my ride.
you cannot seriously think that a blind girl broke into my house.
that would take a lot more than a talking gps.
well, I didn't say that jenna was alone.
let's no go to the toby place, okay?
why not?
you guys think her guide dog left behind his lipstick?
Yeah, do you want to ask what your lab partner was doing last night?
you know, maybe he took a break from sitting on his porch
pulling the heads off of squirrels.
Spencer! Sorry, ladies, I didn't mean to interrupt, but I hope you're as proud of your friend as I am.
Congratulations.
my instincts were right.
this just makes it official.
what's that about?
an essay contest.
wait, did you win it?
aren't you gonna at least open the envelope?
easy. That glass beaker's made of... glass.
maybe you should do it.
I've had too much coffee and not enough sleep.
big party on a thursday night?
no, I-- Slept at a friend's.
what did you do last night?
sat at the grill doing homework.
that's where you study? - Got to.
Jenna listens to her lectures loudly,
and it messes me up.
she doesn't like using her headphones at home.
why the grill? It's not exactly quiet there, either.
it is if you stay late enough.
I close the place, like, every night.
so, whose house did you stay at last night?
that new girl?
who, maya?
why would you think that?
just figured that she's the newest member of your posse.
has she learned the secret handshake yet?
she's... more my friend than the group's.
why is that?
she just cares about different things.
different's good. I like different.
this town has too much of the same.
Hey, there.
I've been thinking about you.
uh, how are things with your family?
they're tense and getting worse.
can you give me an excuse not to go home?
extra credit assignment or si x-Hour detention?
I'm sorry, i actually can't stay late today.
I've got this... thing.
well, no, it's-- It's not a thing.
it's just a, um... thing.
a reading. Of a story.
that i wrote.
you're reading it out loud?
can i come?
you can, but if it sucks...I'm going to hurt myself.
you'd be a witness.
it could get ugly.
you're the teacher.
I'm the student, remember?
do you like the color?
Uh-huh. Thank you.
those are for you.
butter creams.
they're your favorite, right?
Yeah, they were... when I was, like, seven.
Thanks, daddy.
so, you finally spoke to wren?
no, but I spoke with Mr. Sheldrake.
you didn't really think you were gonna be able to keep this essay secret, did you?
Spencer, this is a coup for you.
I mean, if the ivies weren't onto you already, they are now.
I'm seeing a cage match between harvard and yale.
dad, it's really not that big of a deal.
Oh, now you tell me.
your mother's already taken out a full-Page ad in the club newsletter.
I'm kidding. Come on.
have a butter cream.
I'm proud of you, spence.
at least let me brag about you tomorrow.
what's tomorrow?
I'm taking russell newhoff to the club.
he's a potential new client.
you up for playing doubles if he brings his daughter along?
sure! Hey, you want to volley with me?
I'd love to, but...
I have a bunch of calls to return.
and a prize-Winning essay to read.
don't forget to put it on my desk, okay?
Oh, dad, I-- You don't have to read this one.
it's really not one of my best.
somebody sure thought it was.
they don't give these awards to people who don't deserve them.
dental office. Just a minute, please.
Hello?
can i help you?
no. No, I was just, um, looking for a place to toss medical waste.
must be a different floor.
thanks for your help.
I didn't think this would take so long.
I don't mind.
I like being in school when nobody else is.
viscosity, elasticity, and tensile strength.
anything else we need to cover?
maybe our noses. This stuff's rank.
Oh, god!
I'm so sorry.
it's just water.
did you draw this?
it looks just like the cover from this band, circus survive.
this is so good.
you know that band?
my cousin works at a bar on south street.
he snuck me into a show.
have you heard any of their new stuff yet?
it's totally...amazing.
if-- If you're into them, there's this...other band I should turn you onto.
I'll burn you a cd.
Thanks.
I should go.
I'm gonna be late for swim practice.
um, Emily?
yeah?
my notebook.
Oh, jeez.
I totally need more sleep.
or more coffee.
wanna meet up at the grill later?
sure.
and in an instant, her life was undone.
everything she'd known disappeared,
drifting into the summer sky.
thank you.
he doesn't suck, huh?
you know this guy?
Yeah. He's my english teacher.
Oh, very cool. Me and him go way back.
we used to sleep together.
bunk beds! College.
do you have a name, fangirl?
Oh, Aria.
hardy.
what the hell are you doing here?
well, I thought i'd get some face time with the president of your fan club, apparently.
you two know each other?
Yeah, well, not as well as you two know each other.
I, uh, I heard about the bunk beds.
we just met, but I'm glad I sat next to her.
she kept kicking me so I wouldn't snore.
no, no, no, seriously, how did you know about this?
I don't live in a cave.
I saw it on the website,
thought it was my duty to come heckle you.
I think I should be in a cave.
was it really that bad?
no, it was beautiful.
and that metaphor at the end?
that was a metaphor? I thought it was really about a kid who lost her balloon.
you also thought chitty-Chitty ban g-Bang was mexican porn.
that's true.
books aren't his thing, you know?
he used to pay me in frozen burritos to write his papers. What'd be great is if you told this same lame story while I had a beer in my hand.
I'm grabbing a waitress.
I didn't know he was gonna be here.
whoa. Good serve.
listen, hate to interrupt, be we're kind of closed.
I was supposed to shut down the courts ten minutes ago.
Seriously? Um, can you just give me another five minutes?
are you practicing for a tournament or something?
no, um. No, it's just a friendly game of doubles with my dad and some guests.
well, you and I have very different ideas of what's friendly.
that's an angry serve.
well, it's been a long week.
kind of been storing it up.
a strong slice is only half the battle.
you've got to kill it on the return, too.
well, I'm just warming up.
so I hook up with her in the library,
but you can't get serious
in the sociology stacks, right?
so I take her back to my dorm room.
I can't believe you're telling this story.
let him finish. I want to hear.
she wants to hear!
so, I get her back.
you know, he's sound asleep, of course.
I get her shirt off, things are happening,
life is good, and then this geek.
right here, starts laughing in his sleep.
now, he's done this before, but this chick.
she does not believe that he's asleep.
I was.
you laugh in your sleep?
that's cute.
it's better than snoring.
right. Uh, you were up.
no. It's her turn.
take it for me. I'm gonna grab some water.
dude, you are so screwed.
it--it's not what you think it is.
don't give me that look.
I didn't pursue this. It just happened.
and that makes it okay?
Hardy-- Ezra, she's cute. She's smart.
I get it. There's no argument。
but she's your student, man.
that's not how I met her. - Doesn't matter.
when this is all over, she's gonna get her diploma.
you're gonna get a pink slip and an orange jumpsuit.
Aria: okay, so how about this?
the loser of the next game buys fries?
sweet. Give it up.
you in?
thanks for this. I'm having fun.
Yeah, me too.
here you go. Here, i'll go.
sorry I'm late.
boss got chatty when they dropped the check.
but I only ate one lamb chop.
the rest are yours.
what are we looking at?
the worst part of my day.
you know, I thought it bottomed out
when a kid aimed at me for a rinse-And-Spit,
but now there's an amber.
what's an amber?
amber is a cheerleader at rollins high.
who loves skinny lattes.
she's trying to date sean.
she's evil. We know this for a fact?
well, she's suddenly become his personal driver.
and god knows what else.
driving is not dating. Eat.
mom! Why are you feeding me when my boyfriend
left me for someone who weighs 11 pounds?
he hasn't left you. His car's in the shop.
so why can't he hitch a ride with someone who's not majoring in cartwheels?
I am sorry that you don't have a car of your own to drive.
tell your father about that.
no, thanks.
besides, he's probably lreatlpick f one outcfor kate.
Kate? Thought her name was isabel.
that's the mother.
the girlfriend.
the fiancee.
he's marrying her?
Yeah, I found that out
before I went to spencer's last night.
I didn't see you this morning, so I thought it'd be kind of weird to text you.
Yeah. That would've been weird.
Thanks.
still, I'd rather hear it from you than from him.
I'm not surprised. We've both moved on.
try the potatoes. They're tasty.
I'm telling you, that's the lipstick Jenna was putting on in the elevator.
are you sure?
Yes! That's Alison's color.
same shade, same tube.
what I'm wondering is why was Jenna In an empty room for an hour?
I think we should call the police.
there are fingerprints on this tube.
well, yeah, ours.
we don't wanna answer any more questions.
let me get in the office and see what i can find.
have you gotten any more e-Mails?
not since this morning. Have you?
no. I'm just wondering what are you doing here?
Hey, Hanna had a run in with Jenna Marshall today.
sit down.
you know that dentist office I'm working at?
well, I was going in for my shift after school, and I was in the elevator Jenna marshall was in there.
she had the same lipstick Ali wore.
the exact same color.
she had the same lipstick as ali.
she had Alison's lipstick.
she was putting it on.
so, are all college boys like the ones in that bar?
is it possible to say hello to a guy without putting them in a headlock?
well, maybe when you go to college, you'll...find out for yourself.
okay, stop.
did Hardy say something...about us or about me?
no, why would he?
I was just having fun at a bar with a high school student.
you make it sound so awful.
well, maybe it is.
I mean, if you think about it.
well, why?
was I acting like a high school girl?
did I do anything to embarrass you?
look, have I ever done that?
no, it's not about that.
okay, then what is it about?
I mean, is this Hardy's problem, or is it yours?
where did this come from?
age is never an issue when we're together when it's just the two of us,
but when we're out in the world, people notice.
no, Hardy noticed.
look, he's your friend, and if you're okay with it,
I really doubt it's gonna bother him.
Aria, let's get real.
in theory, we are a lot more wrong than we are right.
you wanna be real? Forget about theory.
what does it feel like when we're together?
good. It feels... right.
I wanna be with you.
I wanna hang out in a bar,
introduce you to my friends.
split a plate of fries like everybody else.
but I don't think we can do that.
when I'm with you, I don't care about anybody else.
so, are you talking yourself into this or out of it?
Yes!
N-No! Maybe.
so?
let's review.
look, we're here now,
and it's just the two of us.
and it feels good.
so let's not care together.
where you going?
I have an early tennis day with my dad,
and I have no idea what i'm gonna wear.
there, um, may be this boy.
boy! What boy? Details!
well, there's none yet, but I'll keep you guys posted.
are you Emily? - No. Em?
someone left this for you.
pretty. Who made that?
somebody from school.
well, whoever made it must like you a lot.
no, we were just talking about this band we both like.
is it from somebody you like back?
sorry. You don't have to tell me anything.
but, em...if there's someone in your life who cares about you, then I'm happy for you.
no matter who they are.
Bye.
wait.
you sure you have to go?
Yeah. Yeah, it was so weird when I left home this morning.
I'm not really sure what i'm gonna walk into.
I liked having you here.
well, I didn't say i wasn't coming back.
what if I cook us dinner tomorrow night?
Oh, you cook?
Yeah. How do you feel about enhanced macaroni and cheese?
uh, frightened.
what do you mean by "enhanced"?
well, it means i'm cooking fettuccini,
but I don't want you to get your hopes up.
Hey, champ.
how was practice yesterday?
good. I'm ready to bury them.
heh, yeah. You know, about that.
you might want to keep it friendly on the court, okay?
why does everyone think i'm unfriendly?
I'm serious, spence.
turns out newhoff and his daughter
aren't exactly venus and serena, so just dial it back a bit.
but, dad, I was out there.
for five hours yesterday swatting balls.
well, good, then you'll hopefully be a little sore.
are you asking me to throw the match?
Spencer, i'm asking you to just look at this as a... means to an end, okay?
if he wins, I win. Got it?
easy!
Ah, Martha. You're here.
next time, just push the button.
excuse me?
push the button. That tells me you're here.
okay. - Since it's your first visit, there's some paperwork.
why don't you fill it out in my office?
I'm still renovating out here.
please, have a seat.
Phillip said this was your first time.
you'll be fine.
let me grab a new patient file.
and we can get started.
psychotherapy.
you're her therapist.
you just said her therapist.
Martha, is there someone else joining us today?
is everything all right?
Martha doesn't want therapy.
Martha has to go.
okay, I told you something was up.
can you hear them?
look, whatever it is, it's not about us.
how do you know?
I just do.
look, go get your stuff. We'll go to the library.
we'll study there, okay?
Yeah, but for how long?
just get your stuff.
she lives in this town. I have to see her.
I have to talk to her. I befriended this woman.
Ella, trust me. It is over. Trust you?!
she means nothing to me, and i'm not gonna let her take away from me what matters most.
and what is it that matters to you?
because clearly it is not us.
do you want me to find another job teaching at a different college?
do you want to pick up and move again?
because I will. I'll do that.
is that what iceland was all about?
Yeah. In a way, it was.
because I wanted things to be the way they used to be with us.
and how was that, me looking like a complete and total idiot - Because look at this.
look at this stupidly happy woman.
standing next to her loving husband.
what am I supposed to do with all these family photos - Of our romantic trip abroad? - Stop that! Stop it.
what happened with her was a mistake.
what I know is that you used our daughter to hide this from me.
how could you do that to her?
I don't even know who you are!
I panicked. I thought I didn't have another choice.
I was scared. I was afraid I would lose you.
you just might.
mission accomplished.
you have a question?
no.
we'll meet you in the lobby, okay?
did you waste your real game yesterday?
what? No, I was just off.
no, you weren't, not when the match started.
look, it's a long story.
and it was important for our guests to win.
and so the only way for you to do that.
what's up with that?
did your dad ask you to do that, or...
look, he's not always like this.
whatever you say. I just-- I see a lot of it here.
lot of what?
people playing games...just off the court, you know?
Yeah.
is there any chance you'd want to hang out sometime?
like, not here?
Yeah.
okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Hanna, do you want these?
I wore them once. They gave me a nosebleed.
I think they're a little too dressy for a dental office.
well, you've got some events coming up.
what are you wearing to homecoming?
mom, I don't know if i'm going to homecoming.
of course you're going.
if you're breathing, you're going.
what's up?
you still haven't heard from Sean?
he said we'd talk, but it hasn't happened,
so I'm just giving him space.
Aw. Don't give him too much.
I tried that with your father.
he found a woman in maryland who graduated with honors
from william and mary and loves to golf.
how do you know that?
I googled her.
I'm so sorry, mom.
no...
I'm sorry.
I'm the last person who should be giving anyone relationship advice.
I had too much pride to tell your father.
that I wanted him back.
and now...
maybe you can wear these to his wedding.
on the links.
please tell me you have a really deep pan.
and please tell me I left my phone here.
you did.
what's wrong?
I was trying to work and it kept buzzing.
I thought it was an emergency.
your parents or something.
so I looked at it, um...
just take it.
who's "a"?
I don't know.
how many of your friends did you tell?
I didn't. 'Cause if "a" knows, I'm thinking "b" and "c" and everybody else knows, too.
the person who sent this is not my friend.
you told me you were mature enough to handle this.
do you know what would happen if the school board or anybody...
well, I don't.
just go. go now.
still looking for that trash chute?
uh, no, I left something at my desk this morning.
excuse me.
Yeah.
how much does he want?
for two tickets?
I didn't pay that much to see lionel richie when he was lionel richie.
Hi.
are you, uh, working today?
um, I didn't, yeah. What are you doing here?
my mom left some insurance papers on the desk.
they won't release my car until...wait, you're getting it back?
so, you won't need anyone to drive you around anymore?
you know, someone else?
that's sort of the plan.
great!
well, um, I'll see you later.
all right.
see ya.
are we over?
what?
look, I'd rather you just tell me now before it's too late.
what's too late? What are you talking about?
if you want to take someone else to homecoming, sean, you should.
why would I do that?
it's not like I'd actually go with anyone else.
so what are you doing with that skinny latte who drives you around?
Amber? No, she just drives me to school for our meetings.
this club I joined.
R. L.W. Stands for "real love waits.
go ahead. Make a joke.
is it some kind of hol y-Roller virgin society?
look, I just thought hanging out with other people who feel the same way as I do.
will make it easier to hold out, you know?
no, I get it.
could I go with you to the next meeting?
Why? You wanna join?
well, we already tried doing it my way,
so let's try now doing it your way.
excuse me.
don't tell me that's how you want to celebrate.
with a pear? Put that away!
you deserve a three-Course meal tonight.
think I'll pass. - Pass?
honey, you're the guest of honor.
you won a national award and helped me sign newhoff, which almost didn't happen.
why, didn't I hit the net enough?
no, you were perfect.
but things almost fell apart while you guys were in the locker room.
what happened?
Oh, well, he expected lunch at the club.
of course, I didn't make a reservation.
so there were no tables.
we sat at your favorite table.
after I made a scene.
I had to tell the manager that
the kid on the courts forgot to call it in.
who, Alex?
wait, will he be in trouble over this?
who cares?
kid can pick up balls anywhere, right?
we snagged a major client, spence.
why are you looking at me like that?
just did what I had to do.
to win?
don't give me that attitude.
Spencer, you're just as driven.
and competitive as I am.
don't pretend you're not.
you know what? You're right. I am.
I'm just not sure it's a thing that i want to celebrate anymore.
and by the way, you don't have to read my essay.
why not?
because i stole it.
but i'm gonna win a big, fat award.
so I'm guessing you're okay with that.
you know, cause winning's all that matters, right?
I was hoping you'd be here.
Why?
I really like tracks three, seven, and nine.
nine was the best.
and I'm sorry about last night.
really sorry.
what's that?
something I made for you.
there are a couple girly songs.
so you have to keep an open mind.
coffee, please.
you ready?
Yeah.
cool, then.
let's go.
okay.
what is this?
dinner.
is mom still in her room?
Yeah.
and dad?
do you think they're gonna work this out?
I really don't know.
I got you guys something.
we'll be friends forever.
you lost a dear friend.
you guys need to find a way to say goodbye together.
okay, so the town is gonna put in a new bench, and there's gonna be a pathway of art tiles.
she lives in this town. I have to see her...
you think they're gonna work this out?
I really don't know.
are you moving out?
I was looking for Mr. Fitz.
he's not in. I'm his sub, miss Shepard.
do you know if Mr. Fitz will be back tomorrow?
I don't.
so you've got some genius plan of sleeping with the enemy.
you've lost your mind!
you don't even know him.
we've all got secrets, Emily.
Toby and Jenna had a relationship.
way beyond stepsiblings.
it's enough to want her dead. And us.
so, is Toby dead?
I couldn't bring myself to ask.
I've kept quiet about a lot, Emily.
the least you can do is get me that file.
there! It's done, okay?
I was afraid she wouldn't get it done in time for the memorial.
and this was someone from your mom's gallery?
right.
where is your mom?
there's an apartment above the gallery, so she's staying there. For now.
that's kind of weird, isn't it?
your Mom moving out.
Yeah, like my Dad should have left.
that's what you'd expect.
Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.
the whole thing just... sucks.
I know.
did anyone call Shelly Leonard?
done. And I told her if she plays anything depressing,
I will kick in her cello.
Oh, what about the program?
almost done, but we should finish it...before Ali's brother gets here.
when is that?
tonight. And he wants to see us in the morning.
you know what? I barely remember Jason.
we didn't know him. He was just Ali's older brother down the hall.
behind a closed door.
with his hardcore punk music vibrating the floorboards.
how did he get into an Ivy league school?
I don't know. It must have been affirmative action for goths and emos.
Wow. It's beautiful.
Pedestal's already out there, next to the bench.
this goes up Friday morning.
do you think Jason will like it?
of course he'll like it.
and... years from now, people are gonna see this memorial, and... and that's all they'll ever know about Ali.
she'll be the girl that they dedicated the bench to.
and we'll all be gone, but...
ali will still be remembered.
that's immortality, my darlings.
I wish we could just choose the age that we wanted to be and...
just stay there.
the only way to do that is to die young, leave a beautiful corpse.
don't joke.
it's not a joke.
Oh, come on.
haven't you guys ever thought about how deliciously tragic it would be to die in some incredibly mysterious way?
that would be superior.
is that really how you want to go, Alison?
not just yet.
don't talk like that.
it's gruesome.
it's not gruesome.
it's immortality, my darlings.
where did she get that from? A movie?
ali was a movie.
I was so embarrassed!
so they can just take my credit card?
that's private property, isn't it?
it's private property. It belongs to the bank.
well, what about my other cards?
don't be so quick on the draw, at least for a while.
I'm sorry.
I was trying to keep this off your radar. - Mom.
we have to make some adjustments.
temporary adjustments.
we need to be more careful about money.
for how long? -Until we don't have to anymore.
and how long is that?
I don't know.
well, when will you know?
this is a visual representation of what I'm talking about.
skim milk, orange juice, and some yogurt.
no flavored waters, no cunning chardonnay.
nothing from the artisan cheese shop.
what happened?
what happened is a mortgage, and bills, and taxes, and the fact that this is a one-paycheck family, and we can live a one-paycheck life.
I thought I could compensate for your Dad going, but it's been hard.
harder than I expected.
how hard?
it's not the first card to be declined.
you've done a great job. Really.
mom and Dad and I are really grateful.
there she is!
Hey.
sorry I'm late. No problem.
I was just saying you've done some lovely work on the memorial.
I might have done one or two things differently, but we can adjust that along the way.
here's a copy of the program for the dedication.
I e-mailed you the program that we worked up.
right. I saw the draft. This just fine-tunes it.
uh, let's see...
if Shelly Leonard's gonna play something,
I don't think we can give her more than three minutes.
I remember she's somewhat of a showboat with that cello.
then, uh...
is this...
the picture for the program?
Yes. It's everybody's favorite.
it's the one I would have picked.
I thought I was gonna be able to get my whole family out here, but...
you know, at the last minute, my Mom, um...
it's crazy talking about this, isn't it?
when I think about her, I-I think about you...
the five of you, in her bedroom, laughing, keeping secrets.
long time ago.
I want each of you to speak.
I'd rather hear from you than Mrs. Slocomb from the PTA.
the PTA was a lot of help.
what about the rain? - The rain?
forty percent chance before the weekend.
Oh, um, they said that we can use the school's multipurpose room if we have to move the ceremony inside.
great.
people think this dedication is about closure.
there won't be closure until they find out who did this to Alison.
the cops in this town have been jerking my family around for more than a year.
no more of that.
I'm here to get some action, and this memorial is gonna help me get it.
Oh, and I'm adding one speaker to the program.
you want Jenna to speak at the dedication?
that's right.
Why?
she asked me if she could.
Jenna asked to speak?
is there a problem?
i-it just didn't occur to us that Alison and Jenna were that close.
Yeah, I didn't know either.
Jenna called and... said my sister was a lot of help to her after her accident.
well, concentrate on what you're gonna say.
leave the rest of it to me.
now, I'm...
going to have a talk with Detective Wilden and find out why they haven't located Toby yet.
did we just get fired?
Shh! Keep it down!
why is he talking to Jenna?
I don't know.
what does she have to say?
this is turning into a nightmare.
what else did he say?
nothing. He just kept smiling like he was running for office.
Spence, why does Jenna want to speak at the dedication?
why does Jason want her there?
I mean, he clearly knows they weren't friends.
we can't let Jenna speak.
well, how are we gonna stop her without looking like bitches?
how are we going to stop her at all?
in case you guys didn't notice, we just got patted on the head and sent off to play.
you know what? You need to stay on top of him.
find out what's going on.
why me?
because you're the big organizer.
you've got the laptop of all knowledge, and he's gonna need some of that.
Jenna could get up there, she could tell about the fire and Toby.
she could tell about everything.
Ezra, wait.
just let me talk for a second. Please.
I don't want to argue or try to convince you of anything.
I know it's over. I know that.
but I just- I can't stand the idea of you walking around and hating me.
hate you?
the only person I hate right now is myself, for asking too much of you.
I could never hate you.
but this is band of horses.
Noel got tickets to band of horses?
Yeah. Strictly VIP.
and we get to go? - Yep. You and me... with Noel.
well, who's Noel bringing?
that's the thing- he wants to ask Aria...
but she's got this, like, anti-boy zone around her.
so Noel's at this place where he wants to ask her, but not if she's gonna say no.
so all I have to do is get Aria to go, and we get to go.
you got it. - Perfect.
I can make it happen.
I have to go do a yearbook now, but I will grab her later.
wait, yearbook? Are you working with meta-geek?
if you mean Lucas, yes.
well, watch out. Cooties are contagious.
I cannot believe you just said "cooties."
you're such a goober.
I dare you.
you're awful. - Yes, I am. Come on.
What'd you think I was gonna give you?
I don't know, one of those really sour candies.
not a chance.
um, I had a thought...
why don't we do something one night, instead of just hanging out?
what kind of something?
I don't know. Maybe go for a real dinner someplace, then go somewhere, like... a movie?
dinner and a movie.
think there's a word for that.
what's it called when two people go out like that?
I think they call it, um, a date.
Yeah, I've heard of that.
so you're, um... asking me out on a date?
two friends having dinner, going to the movies...
no big.
Yeah, I'm asking you on a date.
hmm. I'll think about it.
Hey! Maya!
mom?
wait, so people just let you do this?
I mean, you go up to them and say, "can I take a picture of your locker," and they say yes?
if you tell them you have to have their locker for the book, they think it's all about them, and they open right up.
gotta love that human ego.
so, I was thinking four lockers to a page with the name underneath each picture.
no, you know, don't put the names.
they should guess whose locker is whose.
you can put numbers and a list in the back of the book. Be more fun.
Yeah, it would. I like that. It's smart.
this is impressive.
because you're used to taking pictures by pointing your phone at people.
I like a camera that actually feels like a camera.
these aren't cheap, are they?
no, but I auctioned some stuff online and got a good deal for it.
well, what kind of stuff did you sell?
stuff.
action figures?
they were really important to me when I was 12.
who buys action figures from 12-year-old boys who are tired of them?
40-year-old men.
and you can make money that way?
enough money to buy the toys you're interested in now.
so, are you...Interested in selling some stuff online?
Yeah, I wouldn't know how. - I would.
I'm saying, I could help you make a couple of bucks, if you want me to.
Yeah.
I mean, that'd be great, if you could.
just tell me what you've got two of, and we'll sell one of them.
just no kidneys, okay?
it's my Dad.
God, is he okay?
he's okay.
he's... better than okay.
they're rotating his unit out of Afghanistan.
my Dad's coming home.
God, Jenna the jerk is looking at us.
it's a very second-string crowd she's with.
why doesn't she just take her "D"-list gang and go home instead of sitting here and creeping me out?
Jenna's here. Where's Toby?
out in the woods, sacrificing squirrels.
God. Don't you ever get tired of shooting at the low-hanging fruit?
don't ruin a perfect day, Spencer.
it is perfect.
friends forever.
Yeah. Even when we get really old.
subject: the dedication do it right. I'll be watching. just like tom sawyer --
you just want me to go so you can go with Sean.
it's not true! And...
even if it is a little bit true, more reason for you to come.
I don't know.
Aria, what's not to know?
it's not like I'm setting you up with my dud cousin Raymond who makes miniature furniture for a hobby.
this is Noel Kahn.
he was your biggest crush all through middle school, and now he's asking you out, so stop pining for the fjords and " carpe hottie.
it's not about the fjords.
then what's the problem?
the problem is...
I just can't do this right now.
well, now is all I've got.
maybe in a few weeks.
can't you at least get over the guy by tomorrow night?
Hanna, look, my family just blew up. Understand?
well, I thought this would take your mind off of it.
I'd love to get my mind off of it, but I can't.
later.
later.
well, well, well.
something new has been added.
Noel Kahn inspecting the troops.
you know, you really shouldn't go out so soon after a boob job.
let them drop down to where they're supposed to be before you take them out.
prudence Finn had a boob job?
she had to do something to compensate for being named Prudence.
thinking about it, Aria?
thinking about what?
doing something like that to get Noel's attention.
no.
aria likes them brainy.
cute, rich, and brainy.
you get the whole package with Noel Kahn.
you know, personally, I like someone with a little more maturity.
not that Noel doesn't have potential.
he just lacks a little seasoning.
don't be too coy.
Hanna, sorry. count me in.
Hello, Hanna.
principal's office said I could find you in here.
well, I'm pretty sure there's nothing I can do for you, but do you need something?
actually, yeah.
I was wondering if Emily had heard anything from Toby Cavanaugh since he went missing.
do I look like Emily? Ask her.
I thought you girls shared everything. - Well, you were wrong.
Alison's brother's in town. You knew that, didn't you?
Jason. And, yes, I know.
he's here for the dedication of Ali's memorial.
Oh, he's here for more than that, Hanna.
he came into my office yesterday.
he came in to make noise about how he doesn't like the way things have been handled.
I'm pretty sure he's entitled to that.
it's a small town, Hanna.
sometimes private and public lives can get a little muddled.
Yeah. Tell me about it.
look...
I understand you might have some issues with me, but I hope you also understand that whatever you tell Jason DeLaurentis might end up being very embarrassing for your mother.
you might end up hurting the wrong people.
you know, I'm a little hazy about this whole "right and wrong" thing.
are you saying I should or I shouldn't tell Jason that the cop who's investigating his sister's murder used to hang around in my house wearing a towel?
Hello?
I-it's Spencer.
Hello, Spencer.
can I talk to you?
of course you can.
it's about the dedication.
Ali's memorial? You're in charge of that, aren't you?
I was.
now that Jason's here, he's taken over.
does Jason look the same?
I got the impression he was different.
he sounds different.
Yeah.
Yeah, he is different.
he's, uh...
polished.
polished.
you know, when I was talking to him,
I got the strangest sensation, like Ali was in the room with us.
what are you going to say at the dedication?
I was gonna speak from my heart.
Jenna, what do you want?
what I want, you can't give me.
you and your friends are careless.
like I told Emily, you're careless and you break things, and you think you're never gonna have to pay for them.
we are paying for it, Jenna.
we're paying for it every day.
how much?
who's counting?
look, you want some kind of satisfaction. I understand that.
but what you can't do, what I won't let you do, is to turn this dedication into some kind of club to beat up on us.
okay, we did love her, and what happened was terrible.
she deserves this memorial, and so do we, and you don't have the right to turn it into something else.
Alison was done with you.
did you know that?
we talked about it in the hospital.
she told me why. She said she was afraid of you.
is that why one of you did what you did?
I got a Gucci.
I don't know why I got this lam.
thought I had shoes to match.
got a chole. and a
which, I swear, was not this color when I bought it in the store.
what?
you know the way your head gets when I talk about Count Dooku and Darth Sidious?
well...
that's how my head feels right now.
do you think someone will buy these?
it's the law of the universe.
if you put something online, somebody somewhere's willing to buy it.
I really appreciate this, Lucas.
zip.
so... how come all of a sudden you need to make some money?
Oh, um, my Mom cut me off.
happy I can help.
Creepazoid alert.
Hey, Hermie, you got a camera on that thing?
making das booty or something?
no.
my rudder got stuck.
Oh. I bet it did.
go frighten the fish.
Hey!
hey what?
nothing.
never look back, Hanna.
something might be gaining on you.
next.
do you want some coffee? It's reasonably fresh.
Oh, no. No thank you.
I just wanted to make sure that I didn't forget to give you this.
I hope you're okay with cash.
cash?
Yeah. Um... Hanna talked to Aria, and she said that I should give this to you.
Hanna talked to Aria about money?
Yeah. For the... for the memorial.
Oh!
that money. Of course. Thank you.
I would have written you a check, but I don't trust my checkbook skills right now.
things are a little distracted at the moment.
Yeah, Hanna said you were on your own over there with the kids.
Yes, I am on my own there.
for now.
how are you doing?
uh... well, I don't think I have enough information to give you a solid answer on that one.
I understand.
well, I would pry, but then you would feel obligated to listen to my tales of divorce, which I wouldn't want to put you through.
we don't know if we're gonna be getting a divorce.
that's one of the things that we need to talk about, once we figure out how to talk at all.
Yeah. Not where we thought we'd be, is it?
no, not even close.
I mean, I feel like I'm living inside of this wind tunnel.
all of this stuff is just flying at me.
well, the wind dies down to a nice, steady howl after a while.
well, does it ever just stop altogether?
I will let you know if it does.
Thanks.
you do the same for me, okay, neighbor?
deal.
well, that was painless.
not for principal Hartman.
he means well, but he needs to know who's in charge.
I think we all know that.
okay, is there a problem?
there's no problem.
you're Alison's brother.
you should have the final say.
but you're not the only one dealing with this.
see, there's that closed door again...
the secrets of the girls cuddled up in Alison's bedroom.
do you think that means you knew her better than I did?
no. It just means we knew her in a different way.
right here.
what are they doing?
that's Toby's locker.
detective Wilden.
you'll find this interesting.
we're having a look in Toby Cavanaugh's locker.
Why? Do you think he's hiding in there?
he's a suspect.
well, your investigation better turn up more than Toby Cavanaugh's old gym socks.
you made it quite clear the other day you weren't happy with the pace of the investigation.
you said you wanted action.
I'm trying to give that to you.
Yeah, you've got nothing. I realized that yesterday.
sometimes, Jason, we withhold information on the progress of an investigation to avoid any interruptions.
the only reason you're tearing this kid's locker apart is because he's not around to object.
Toby Cavanaugh called your sister's cell phone the night she disappeared.
I checked the phone records. She took the call.
Toby called Alison the night she died?
he did.
or somebody else did using his phone.
there go Noel and Prudence off to the kissing rock.
people have been sneaking off to the kissing rock for hundreds of years.
you're making that up.
just because I make it up doesn't mean it's not true.
you go there with somebody, and you can feel the ghosts of the other lovers spying on you, pushing you to do it.
you know, you should never disappoint a ghost.
it's just a dusty old rock.
who do you want to take there?
this concert should be great.
most important thing about a band is the name.
I should know, cause I had one.
you had five guys in Greg Samson's garage.
what was the name?
we had the best name ever- Tick Beaubien.
it was some guy I saw in a Western when I was a kid.
guys, we should get going.
thanks for the pizza, Noel. Don't put it away.
it'll be perfect room temperature when we get back.
that's the guy back with the crazy bread.
No! No, it's too late for that.
I paid for crazy bread, I want my crazy bread.
can you at least pretend to be having a good time, for me, please?
I'm having a great time.
Aria, the lights in this house are dimming because of all the energy you're sucking out of the air.
okay, well, I'm doing the best I can.
look who's here.
it wasn't the crazy bread.
Hi.
Hey, Lucas.
uh, I just came by to tell you that the thing that we were talking about worked out.
Oh. Good.
you can look at it if you want.
okay.
I'll... see you later.
what's he doing, coming to your house?
uh, nothing. Yearbook stuff.
what's your Dad's rank?
lieutenant colonel, Pennsylvania national guard.
and he's been right in the middle of it?
camp Phoenix, in Kabul.
Oh, my God. When's he get back?
ten days.
I can't imagine how happy you are.
when I see him, I'll be happy.
when he's really home.
then I'll be able to start breathing again.
do I get to meet him?
you were right about the weather.
rain's starting at midnight, continuing throughout the day.
I wish this was gonna be outside, in the sun.
are you satisfied?
Yeah. How about you?
I'll just be glad when this is over.
are we talking about the dedication or...
finding out what happened to Ali?
both, I guess.
the dedication will be fine, thanks to you.
and I lit a fire under the cops.
did you know that Toby called Alison?
no.
Wilden shouldn't have told me, but he was easy to shake up.
you were the only one who ever really challenged Alison.
I remember hearing the two of you getting in each other's grills a couple of times.
kept waiting for the catfight, but... never happened.
who do you think killed Alison?
the police like Toby Cavanaugh.
if they can't find him, they'll start liking someone else.
just someone, or someone in particular?
does it really matter?
I thought you said you wanted closure.
my Mom still needs pills to get to sleep.
when they don't work, you can hear her walking around the house at three in the morning.
you think you're ever really gonna have closure?
I mean, aren't you always going to be "the friend of that girl who was murdered"?
just like you'll always be her brother?
that's how people will see us.
they solve it or they don't. That's not going to change, so...
I guess it doesn't really matter.
what about justice.
you don't really want to bring justice into this, do you?
why not?
Alison told me about the fire.
about how you said the five of you should all go over and teach Toby a lesson.
how you got the stink bomb and...
convinced the rest of the girls to back you up.
how you even threatened Toby if he told the truth.
Alison told you that?
Yes, she did.
did you believe her?
you are just like Alison, aren't you?
in some ways, even worse.
you okay?
sure.
we all just wondered what happened to you.
sorry.
can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, I guess.
I just want to be clear on something, okay?
remind me, did I run over your dog or something?
because I don't remember doing anything to get you this mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.
could have fooled me.
I'm sorry, Noel.
I...I should have said no to this.
it was a bad idea.
bad idea going out, or a bad idea going out with me?
no. It's me.
you're great. I mean...
you're Noel.
terrific. I'm a brand name.
I heard about your folks splitting up.
they're not split. They're separated.
and Hanna... told me about the boy back in Iceland.
she shouldn't have told you that.
so I guess this guy was serious.
Yeah. He was special.
he is special, but...
right now there's just all this distance between us.
does he speak English?
beautifully.
too bad.
I was hoping for a language barrier.
Yeah, I mean, I know what I want to happen with him...
but...
I also know that I have to be realistic, and there's only a couple of ways that all this can play out, and it ranges from messy to bad.
and even if it does work out,
I still have my family to worry about.
a minute ago, back when I got you to smile,
I thought I might try for a kiss.
now I think I'll wait, but I'm gonna keep my options open...
if that's okay with you.
sos
wait, so she tried to pin it on you?
that's what she told Jason.
but why you?
because Spencer could stand up to her, and Alison didn't like that.
God, this is officially insane!
is that what she told Jenna when she was at the hospital?
I don't know.
I mean, I don't think so, but I don't know.
okay, so... so one minute, she's trying to cover it up and the next she's ratting us out to her brother?
like she wanted Jason to know the fake story in case anything happened to her.
Why?
so they'd know who to blame.
God!
this is still Alison's movie, and we are just filling up the screen.
you went to the grocery store.
uh, yeah. I sold some stuff online.
you sold some stuff online?
just a couple of bags I was bored with.
don't ever do that again.
don't sell your things!
no, it's okay.
really, it was fun, in a nerdy way.
you shouldn't have to do that.
I will take care of things. I promise.
mom, don't worry about it. Really.
you should get going.
you don't want to be late.
okay.
wait... Melissa's lan?
I can't remember not knowing Alison...
not having her as a friend.
she was the first person I knew long enough that I felt I could be angry with without worrying that I was gonna lose her.
it made me feel like something was gonna last, and you need that, especially when you're a kid.
friends can be hard on you.
maybe they expect more from you than strangers.
strangers pretty much see you the way you want them to see you, but... you can't fool friends.
that's what makes them friends.
that corner of the park is going to be a safe place where you can go and sit, read a book, and just think.
you should think about Alison while you're there.
she'd want to make sure you didn't forget about her.
you do something like this...
a memorial...
partly because you don't understand what's happened.
so, you... you plant flowers and you paint tiles, and...
somewhere in the middle of all that work, you stop crying.
I guess that's the point.
she would have liked that you were all here.
she would have liked the attention.
no, actually, she would have loved the attention.
it would have made her laugh.
and Alison laughing...
et that was amazing.
we think we know who we are, but we don't.
not until something bad happens to us, and then all the useless things fall away, and we're left with who we really are.
I learnt that from Alison Dilaurentis.
my whole life, I thought I knew who she was, but I found out the truth when she came and talked to me at the hospital.
I found out that she was the strongest person that I had ever met.
and it's her strength that touched so many people.
shaped them.
that's her real legacy.
that's how her memory will endure, in the actions of those she inspired in so many different ways.
from all of us...
thank you, Alison.
I need sugar.
me too. I'm buying.
that was my folks.
they say thanks.
so do I.
you're welcome.
and I want you girls to have something.
the police returned this to my family.
I think you should have it.
the police gave that to you?
Alison was wearing it.
you mean when they found her?
after listening today,
I just... thought you should have it.
I'll be in touch.
if that's Alison's bracelet, what about the one we found in the woods?
I-I don't know.
someone made a copy of Alison's bracelet.
Yeah, and made sure that we would find it.
what are you looking at?
not "what." "who." That new kid?
I don't want to go there. I heard he's sketchy.
you should probably go first, and I'll count to fifty.
okay.
I barely remember Jason.
we didn't know him, he was just Ali's older brother down the hall.
that's Alison's bracelet.
what about the one we found in the woods?
someone made a copy of Alison's bracelet.
well, if the bank finds out about your unauthorized loan, that's like a felony, right?
it's only a felony if they find out.
Hey, was that Maya?
how is she? - It's all good.
I'm not sensing "good" here, Emily.
maybe she's moved on.
find a better place to hide it.
there's a shadow right there, like someone was following her.
Spence, do you know who that is?
I have no idea.
wait. Where's Ian?
don't worry, he went to Philly to be with Melissa.
I didn't realize life existed at this hour.
come on, guys, just walk. You need to see this.
I always hoped my first sunrise would have tequila in it.
I'll make coffee.
well, when it's ready just pour it down my throat.
I thought we were done looking at this.
I mean, we know the shadow is Ian, right?
you woke us up for this?
it's important. I couldn't let it go.
have you been up all night? - Maybe.
you have. One eye is bigger than the other.
you look like a strung out power puff girl.
stop looking at the eye. Just look at the picture.
who's having coffee?
there's only one place where this picture could have been taken from.
where? - Alison's bedroom.
no, Alison is in the picture. She clearly didn't take that.
okay, but somebody in her house did.
like who, her parents?
no. Her brother.
you know, my mom ran into him at the bank.
he's back in town. - Why?
we have to call him.
I am not going to talk to him. - Me either.
I will.
we need to know if he took this.
okay, can you move that meeting up?
I'll need to be on the road by four.
okay, great.
let's go over the schedule for the rest of the week.
would you pass me a banana?
that got moved to thursday.
what?
when did that get on the schedule?
no - No, it's fine.
did she say what the appointment's about?
I'm just surprised, that's all.
okay. Thanks, Denise. I'll see you when I get in.
what just happened?
Mrs. Potter made an appointment to see me this week.
the lender... Of our unauthorized loan.
I thought she came to the bank once a year.
Yeah, well, she's a year early, and I'm $50, 000 short.
what are we gonna do?
you're gonna go to school.
Hey. - Hey... Jason.
I'm - I'm sorry to interrupt your workout.
this can wait. - Really.
it didn't sound that way on the phone.
what are you doing back in town?
just... Taking care of family business.
Spencer, why did you come here?
this was sent to me.
it looks like it was taken from the second floor of your house.
Yeah. It does.
so, why do you sound not convinced?
look, after Ali disappeared, we got bizarre things in the mail.
sympathy cards from strangers and letters with conspiracy theories about what happened to her...
sometimes it was photos
blurry images of a blond girl running away from the camera.
but that's definitely Ali.
and it's my yard.
and it was taken the night that she disappeared.
I mean, look. She's got the same yellow top on.
Spencer, they have programs now that make photoshop look like scissors and a glue stick.
look, I'll tell you what. My family hired a P.I. I'll take the picture to him and see what he comes up with.
Ali's memorial was the hardest thing I've ever done.
I was a jerk. I - I know that now.
well, that wasn't the term that I would have used, but... It works.
good time.
ease up, fields.
this is a practice, not a meet.
looks like somebody ate their wheaties this morning.
way to hustle, Emily. - Thanks, coach.
Paige, looks like you've got some competition.
Emily, remember, she likes to win.
happy to have her back.
so, is this for real this time?
can we count on you for the full season? - Yeah.
I was distracted for a while, but... That's over now.
okay. Good.
Hanna, stop worrying.
there's nothing we can do at this point.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Hanna. Hi. Who are you talking to? - My mom.
is everything okay?
everything's fine.
here.
I forgot to give these to you last night.
thank you.
I owe you big-time.
are you sure your dad's not gonna miss these? - Please.
he joined the museum board for networking.
the man doesn't know the difference between a Monet and a Mojito.
well, hey, how can I get you back?
pay for the extra toppings on my pizza delivery.
all right, you got it.
Oh, and a DVD rental, because if I have to hole up in my room all night as your alibi,
I would like to do it with Jake Gyllenhaal.
wait. What alibi?
aren't you both going to the museum thingie?
no Spencer got the tickets for... Me and Ezra.
you're taking Mr. Fitz?
I really wish you'd just call him Ezra.
and yes, I'm taking him. He just... Doesn't know it yet.
it's a surprise.
I don't know, I just figured that a date out of town would give us a chance to actually have a date.
Yeah. I get it.
you guys do kind of have the social lives of shut-ins.
girls? Hi.
Hey, everyone?
can I get everyone's attention, please?
I've been thinking a lot about team spirit lately.
what is spirit? And how can we create - actually, can you not open your presents until after I'm done?
like I was saying, a leader inspires spirit.
these are my gift to you to boost morale - All righty, Paige, I'm sure everybody appreciates your gifts, but I want you swimmin', not shoppin'.
all right! Listen up, sharks!
I want you focused. Like Emily.
she renewed her commitment and broke a record today!
that's what I'm talkin' about!
I like that! all right, ladies, let's get back to class.
come on! Come on!
Hey, Paige, I just.
Hey. - Miss montgomery. What can I do for you?
I was wondering if you could look over my reading assignment.
perhaps this could wait until after the makeup test has been administered.
actually... It would be great if you could just review it now so I know I'm on the right track?
okay.
what do you think of my work so far?
looks outstanding. - Great.
then I'll turn it in at the end of the day. - Great.
Hi, this is Ashley marin.
please leave me a message, I'll get back to you.
Hanna, we missed you in P.E. again today.
I missed you too.
well, that's the third time you've ditched P.E. So I'm gonna have to give you detention for the rest of the week.
excuse me, but my ankle is still throbbing.
I don't know if you heard, but I got hit by a car.
I heard, but I also saw you complete the six-hour dance marathon on saturday.
that was for a good cause, and my adrenaline kicked in.
you know when moms get super-human strength when their kids are trapped under a tree or, a hummer?
is that who pulled you out from under the car?
okay, well, call your super-mommy and tell she that you'll be coming home late this week.
skipping gym?
if you really want to earn some bad girl stripes, I'd be happy to help.
if you're proposing that we get matching tattoos, the answer is no.
mom? - Hey, sweetie.
what's happening? What are you doing?
I, I thought I'd make some pancakes.
I haven't made 'em in a while.
you want to get the mix? It's in that cabinet.
you know, I didn't tell you this, but when you were in the hospital and they...
gave you the stitches behind your ear, they wanted to shave off all your hair on that side.
and I told them,"no way."
I know my kid, and she may be unconscious now, but if she wakes up with a shaved head.
she is gonna go into permanent shock
I want you to know that no matter what happens, you will always...
be my baby girl, and I will always figure out a way to take care of you.
you want some bacon? I'll make some bacon.
pretty.
Thanks. - Congratulations on your times today.
first freestyle, now butterfly - You break any more records and we'll have to test you for doping.
bring it on.
you know, you'll have to do more than break records if you want to become team captain.
who said I wanted to become captain?
come on, Emily.
you checked out on this team for months, and now you check back in and act like you never left?
of course you're gunning for captain.
I'm not gunning for anything. - Good.
because being so into the breast stroke could really end up hurting you.
what does that mean?
it means we all know what team you really play for.
you know what, Paige? You need to suck it up.
if you want to beat me, work harder.
Hey, Han. - Oh, hey.
so, I'm gonna get a mani-pedi after school.
do you want to come?
I can't. I've got homework.
homework?
what subject is more important to you than your cuticles?
hey... Why are you so down?
is it about you and John breaking up?
that doesn't mean you give up on him.
believe me, with all the stuff that Ezra and I have had to deal with, we should have been history by now.
well, maybe it's a sign from the universe.
maybe you guys should just... Cool off for a while.
what do you mean "cool off"? - Take a break.
don't see each other in rosewood or... Anyplace else.
honestly?
I can deal with the universe throwing me curveballs, but if they're gonna start coming from my best friend, then I have a problem.
Aria, you have to sneak off to Philly just to have a date - with him. - You really don't want me to be with him.
I don't want you to get hurt.
he's not the one who's hurting me.
please, just don't go tonight, okay?
I have a bad feeling about this date.
I think that bad feeling is called "jealousy."
that's not what this is about. - Really?
because that's exactly what it looks like.
why is this called "meat" casserole?
that lunch lady has a gift for suspense.
Where's Hanna? - Who cares.
what?
I don't know.
how's swim practice?
can we talk about something else?
okay. I've heard of communal cramps, but this is ridiculous.
what happened to all that "first real date" excitement?
I mean, yesterday you were ready to give me tongue for giving you two tickets.
you're not into it anymore? - No.
I mean, yes. Yeah, I'm... So into it.
we're... Gonna have an amazing time tonight.
okay, so... Talk. What are you gonna wear?
I can't decide between my backless or my strapless.
go with the red one. Be bold. What do you think, em?
about what? - What are you looking at?
it's nothing.
just some girl on my swim team who wants me to disappear.
what's her name? - Paige Mccullers.
I know her.
we played field hockey together. We named a penalty after her.
What'd she say?
some snarky comment about me being gay.
I will destroy her. - Can I help?
it's okay. I took care of it.
anyone else thirsty? I'm gonna get a drink.
who's this from? - Paige.
whatever it is, you can have it.
she's trying to bribe her way to becoming the next team captain.
do you... Think they're from the same place?
it's possible.
if they were, maybe the store owner could tell us who bought the fake Alison bracelet.
Yeah, or maybe even the Jenna one.
and we would know who "A" is.
there's only one way to find out.
who can tell me if appeasement actually worked?
anybody? It didn't.
when the territory was annexed, Hitler's aggression only increased.
would anybody like to share their thoughts on why appeasement did not work?
because giving in to a bully never works.
can you elaborate on that a little bit?
even if you give them everything that they ask for, it'll never be enough.
your only choice is to stand up to them, even if it costs you something.
very nice. Okay, people, please do not race me towards the door, it hurts my feelings.
term paper is next week. Don't forget.
Mrs. Montgomery!
ms. Marin, detention is that way.
I know, but I have to talk to Mrs. Montgomery.
it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
it can't. I have to talk to her today.
you should have thought of that earlier. Move it.
take it inside, take it inside.
are you stalking me? - Yeah.
can't get enough of that knock-off cologne.
Hey, princess. Where ya goin'?
the princess needs a pee. Good luck.
we get our bathroom break at ten after.
I have got to get out of here. - What's the hurry?
you want to be the first in line to see your boy Justin Bieber's new movie?
first of all, it's not just a movie - It's his real story.
about what-his hair?
you know what, just don't talk about the Beebs, okay?
you don't know the beebs, you don't understand the Beebs.
or his hair. - Calm down, girl. It's only an hour.
in an hour she'll already be in Philly.
who? - Mrs. Montgomery.
the teacher? Why do you care?
forget to turn in your homework? - No.
but if she gets there... A lot of people are gonna get hurt.
is Mrs. Montgomery running a terrorist cell?
why am I even talking to you? Just turn around, sketchy.
why do you get to leave?
my social worker just had me excused.
you know, email is a beautiful thing.
meet my social worker.
Hey, where are you?
you look good.
I - I thought we were taking the train.
I know you had your heart set on being coughed on by commuters, but.
so this is what a real date with Ezra Fitz looks like. Damn.
you can hang up now.
I got a message you wanted to see me.
have a seat, girls.
an incident involving a homophobic comment has been brought to my attention.
now, we have a zero tolerance policy - Coach walton, whatever happened between us, it's over now.
I need to know what happened, and then I'll decide if it's over.
there is really nothing to talk about.
in that case, you can go, Paige.
Emily, if you don't tell me what happened, there's nothing I can do to help you.
it was just a misunderstanding.
can I go?
did you turn the key quickly? - Yes, I did.
any quicker and it'll snap off in my hand.
of course the car had to break down when I'm on my way to an art opening.
why couldn't it break down when I'm on my way to, say, - I don't know, jury duty? - It hasn't broken down.
it's the kill switch. Try it again. Go ahead, jiggle it.
I did jiggle it. - Well, try it again.
I wouldn't have to master the finer art of jiggling - if you had just listened to me in the first place. - Ella, please, not again.
I begged you not to buy a used car with a kill switch.
you didn't even know what a kill switch was.
it's a switch that stops the flow of electricity to the engine so that thieves cannot steal the car!
well, now you know, after I explained it to you.
that's it.
I will hitchhike. - You know what?
next time call AAA instead of making me drive all the way out of my way to help you.
I did call AAA, and we have used up our entire towing allowances.
that's not possible.
it is when you drive a used car with a stupid kill switch!
your housekeeper let me in, said I could wait for you here.
so... What did your private investigator say?
well, the picture... Is real.
and for all I know, I may have taken it.
what do you mean you may have taken it?
I honestly don't remember.
I'm not proud of it, but that whole august is a blur.
I was high for most of it.
you were?
are you surprised?
well... It's just to me you were always Ali's strange older brother.
we never saw you. You were always behind a closed door.
yeah - Getting high with a bunch of losers.
you remember that phony your sister used to date?
Ian? Ian Thomas?
we partied that whole summer.
after he broke up with your sister, he practically lived at my house.
but Ian's a triathlete. He's the poster boy for preppy.
poster boy by day and party boy by night.
convincing though, isn't he?
you can only repair things so many times before they break for good.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
I was talking about the car. - You sure about that?
Yes.
you know what, just leave it alone. I can call a cab.
maybe next time you'll find a date classy enough to pick you up.
I'm not meeting a date.
this ticket was given to me by the P.T.A. One ticket.
you're the one wearing a new shirt - Are you going on a date?
Oh, my god... You're going on a date.
Ella, I don't want to - you bought a new shirt for this person.
why didn't you just say something?
because this is not something I want to discuss.
have you been working out?
Ella. - What?
you walked out on me. Remember?
I think I need to call a cab if I'm going to make it on time.
no, I'll drive you. - No, no, no.
we both don't have to be late. - No.
you're not gonna be late, and neither am I.
all right? It's fine, I'll drive you.
I can't believe Ian spent that whole summer at Alison's house.
watching Alison. - I'm officially creeped out.
can you be creeped out and eat at the same time? Faster?
why do we have to eat dinner at four-thirty?
because this appointment is at five, and it's far away, and I don't know how long we're gonna be there.
we both know what happens to me when my blood sugar drops.
why do I have to eat? - I guess you don't.
and why'd you have to make an appointment for a bead shop?
because this shop is at her home.
sounds like she makes dream catchers in her kitchen.
are you sure you don't want that? - I'm stuffed.
if I eat any more I'll be swimming in two lanes.
that's okay. You can have your lane and Paige's lane.
did the coach kick her off the team?
what do you mean?
for what she said.
how did you know the coach knew about that?
because I told her.
what? You spoke to my coach?
why would you do that?
because that girl has been bullying people since J.V.
and she needs to be put in her place.
she was-by me, when it happened. - Why are you so mad?
I didn't think you'd care if I spoke to your coach.
I thought you were fine with people knowing that you and maya were a couple.
I am. I'm not upset that the coach knows I'm gay.
I'm mad because if I wanted her to know what paige had said, I would have told her myself.
I'm not some helpless little lamb.
I know that, but you're my friend and I didn't want her to get away with it.
well, I can stand up for myself.
well, you never did with Alison.
thank you for making sure my feelings didn't get hurt.
Emily, I'm sorry - I have to go.
I just remembered I have a test tomorrow.
sorry, I just needed a breath of fresh air.
it's cool.
I can't believe the artist is a no-show.
if somebody threw me a party with champagne and crab cakes to celebrate my work, I think I'd try and stop by.
if it were my work, I'd show up if people put out folding chairs and sweaty jeans.
Plus, I'd be there. - True.
are you disappointed that the artist didn't show up? - No.
the only person I cared about seeing is you.
I'm sorry. For a second I forgot I was - Not in rosewood?
it's okay. Me too.
when I first saw the limo, I thought I was gonna have to ride in the trunk.
I could get used to this.
ready for more culture?
lead the way.
Hi, mom.
what are you doing here?
I couldn't just sit around in my room and wait.
what are you gonna say to her?
I need you to go home.
why can't you just tell her the truth?
Hanna, please.
I can't lose you, too.
so sorry to interrupt.
I just got off the phone with Mrs. Potter's housekeeper.
she called from the hospital.
Mrs. Potter had a heart attack.
is she going to be okay?
they couldn't revive her.
poor thing. I mean, she wasn't young, but still...
thank you for telling me, Denise.
I know, baby.
that smell never went away.
it came with the car.
no, actually it came from Mike dropping a turkey wrap underneath the driver's seat, remember?
it had been there for, like, a year or something? - More.
by the time we found it, you thought it was roast beef.
I did.
Oh, you have enough cash for a cab ride home? Okay.
well, so, I guess that's it.
have a good time. - Thanks.
I can't believe you drove me all the way here. - Why?
I just - I don't know anybody else who would do that for me.
well, it's only fair.
I mean, I was the one who suggested that we buy a used car with a kill switch.
goodbye. - Goodbye.
well, I know it's in here somewhere.
Oh, here it is.
I have wonderful earrings to match.
Thanks, but, um, I just came here to find out who bought these two bracelets.
Oh, well, let me see.
well, I can tell you these bracelets were made within the last six months.
I changed vendors.
people were complaining about the clasps.
you do keep records, right?
Yes, dear, I'm trying, but as you can see,
I'm a little better at beading than organizing.
please, it's important to me.
wait a minute.
here it is! You found it?
Yes!
now, these two were purchased by a Spencer hastings.
does that help, dear?
I was just calling you.
Yeah, I've kind of been avoiding you.
I kind of got that feeling.
listen, I need to tell you something.
last night - Last night was one of the best nights of my life.
wait. Did you go to the museum?
Yeah, in a limo.
and the only thing that made it less than perfect was being in a fight with you.
I'm sorry, Hanna, I'm...
I'm sorry for going off on you like that.
and you're right, okay? Being with Ezra, it's a risk...
but he's someone that I'm willing to take a risk for.
I know it sounds stupid. - No, it doesn't.
I get it.
so, what did you want to say? - Nothing.
I'm just really glad it worked out.
what the hell? - I saw the lineup.
I know what you're doing.
what are you talking about?
coach replaced me as the relay anchor with you.
so go and talk to coach! - Like you did?
I would never rat out a teammate because my feelings were hurt.
I take care of things myself.
you are like one of those things that sticks to the side of boats that can only be removed with a hacksaw or something.
very nice. I thought fancy rosewood girls like you knew how to say "please" and "thank you."
well, please peel your sweaty body off of my locker. Thank you.
so, you want to give it back to your teacher, toss it, or, put it on your charm bracelet?
what is that?
it's what stopped Mrs. Montgomery from getting to Philly.
she didn't get there?
how do you do that?
you want a lesson in popular mechanics, - Or do you want to just say thank you? - Neither.
so, how much do I owe you?
I don't want your money.
well, then, what do you want?
I'll think about it.
and, by the way, they're barnacles.
what? - The things that stick on the side of boats.
Hey, I was just going to text you.
Why? What's up?
I was wondering what you were doing after school today and hoping you might want to go clothes shopping with me.
sure.
why the sudden urge to splurge?
I just think it's time to upgrade a little.
so, how was your sleep-over at Spencer's?
Oh, you know. The usual.
chick flick, popcorn, cosmo quiz, lights out.
how about you?
me? I had a great night.
Oh, yeah? What'd you do?
I went to see this really wonderful exhibit.
what?
Yeah, they had a big opening at the Philadelphia Art Museum.
you- you went last night? - Yeah.
Oh, I know, partying on a school night, I know I'm out of control, but... It was great, it was really exciting to meet the artist.
it was really exciting.
so, anyhow, I have to get to class, and so do you, - so meet me in my office after. - Yeah.
sure. - Okay.
keep your voice down. - Why? Nobody's home.
Yeah, but Melissa could come home any minute.
good. I want her to.
why are you making me do this?
why do you care if she knows?
I'm not making you do anything, Spencer.
I'm telling you, by tomorrow morning Melissa will know everything, and there's nothing you can do about it except let her hear it from you first.
fine. I'll tell her. You win.
but this it is, because I am sick of your games.
we all are.
you trying to get me voted off the island?
it won't work. - I don't think you'll have much of a choice.
I made you, Spencer.
I made all of you.
before me, you were just some goody-goody in plaid who did whatever mommy and daddy told her to.
you are so full of yourself!
you think that just because you brought us together you can treat us like puppets?
but you are. Don't you see that?
you don't exist without me.
really, Ali?
then tell me this - what is a leader without any followers?
because it seems to me the question isn't whether we will exist without you, but whether you will exist without us.
and as I'm concerned, you are dead to me already.
so the shadow in the picture isn't Ian, it's you? - Yeah.
why didn't you tell us before?
I don't know.
I guess that I was scared.
this is gonna sound crazy, but I think that I didn't tell you because there was always a part of me that wondered if it was my fault.
I mean, I wished it, and then it came true.
Oh, Spence, you didn't mean it.
it was just something you said in the heat of the moment.
besides, Ai said stuff to us that was worse- much worse-right?
Oh, my god!
is that... - It's Jason.
beading is hard on the eyes, you know?
Oh, don't be startled.
that's just my pet. Where was I?
Oh, yeah, the eyes.
you have interesting eyes, dear.
the eyes are the window to the soul.
not to worry, dear.
I did exactly what you told me to do.
aren't you both going to the museum thing?
Spencer got the tickets for me and ezra.
please, just don't go tonight, okay? I have a bad feeling about this date.
I think that bad feeling is called jealousy.
they had a big opening at the philadelphia art museum.
you went last night?
why is he out of jail? - He's out on bail.
why don't you save us the cost of a trial and drop dead!
you'll have to do more than break records if you wanna become team captain.
who said I wanted to become captain?
what the hell?! - I take care of things myself.
you remember that phony your sister used to date?
they partied that whole summer.
he's the poster boy from preppy. - Convincing, isn't he?
so you wanna give it back to your teacher or put it on your charm bracelet?
what is that?
it's what stopped mrs. Montgomery from getting to philly.
who's this from? - Paige.
she's trying to bribe her way to becoming the next team captain.
do you think they're from the same place?
these two were purchased by a spencer hastings.
does that help, dear?
Ah, so it's just gonna be you and your brother tonight, and he wants to order in from sausage heaven.
again? Seriously?
dad, the closest thing they have to a vegetable is a paper plate.
listen, just tell mike that it's your night to pick, okay?
okay. So you're definitely not eating with us?
uh, no, no, I - I've got this thing.
it's with the head of the department, and dinner's included, so...
have a great day, sweetheart.
Oh, hey, dad, I need your pledge for the dance marathon. The deadline's today.
Oh, right. That's right. Uh, my checkbook is in my jacket in the hall.
did you find it?
what? Um, yeah.
great.
dad, what's this?
well, that's a ticket for the museum.
is it yours?
no, no, it's, uh, it's your mother's.
uh, her car broke down, and she needed to borrow mine to get there.
so she was at the museum on thursday night?
Yeah. I- I mean, I- I think so.
you know, actually, you should really just talk to your mom about that.
here you go. - Thanks.
is my chemistry book over there?
uh, I don't see it.
it's probably in the room, spence, not the frontyard.
what happened to the cavanaughs' mailbox? Somebody hit it?
it's not the first time, and i'm sure it wasn't an accident.
every time I come home, toby's out there cleaning up some new mess.
and please don't say he deserves it.
I wasn't gonna say that.
is that it?
Thanks.
do you still think that somebody framed him? - Toby?
do we really wanna have this fight right now?
I have to save up some of my energy for swim practice.
we're not on different sides anymore, em.
I mean, I know what it feels like to have somebody say that you did something when you know that you didn't.
are you talking about the bracelets?
I'd never seen that bead lady before that day, and yet she had my name written down on two sales receipts.
we should go. We're gonna be late.
I owe you an apology. Seriously.
you believed that he was innocent from day one, and I jumped down your throat.
I said some really heinous things about toby.
you shouold apologize to him, not me.
Hey. - Hey. Cute boots. New?
Oh, ish. What is with this line?
all the vending machines are on lockdown.
someone's been breaking into them after hours and stealing food.
I heard this one kid say the alarm went off at like 3: 00 a. m.
what, the vending machines have alarms? - School.
someone's been sneaking out of the building in the middle of the night, which makes zero sense.
who'd wanna be here any longer than they have to?
hmm, well, I might. Going home just got scary.
this was in my dad's coat.
he said it's my mom's, but I'm starting to wonder if he was at the museum, too.
your dad? No.
why was he so twitchy when I asked?
if they both were there the same night as me and ezra- - Aria, you're just on a loop.
it was a coincidence. - Is it?
han, come on, you don't think it's weird that my mom had a ticket the same night?
Yes, a weird coincidence.
um, can you get my coffee? I'll be right back.
we need to talk.
you know that thing you did with Mrs. Montgomery's car?
well, just pretend like it never happened, okay?
don't talk about it, don't blog about it, don't tweet about it. Clear?
can I speak now? - Okay, if you must, but it's really annoying.
the way I see it, you owe me. - For what?
for doing that thing I can't talk, blog, or tweet about.
was there a second watch? Was anyone else keeping time?
it was a tie, paige. You and emily tied.
so what's gonna happen? Who gets to anchor tomorrow?
can't make that decision yet.
all right, listen up, sharks.
we'll meet tomorrow morning, same place, same time, and have ourselves a little swim-off.
so, I guess we'll just figure this out tomorrow.
you figure it out. I need to win.
Aria. Hi, sweety.
your ears must've been burning. - why?
I was just talking to the principal about you and Mr. Fitz.
Why?
well, he wants to take your class to new york to see the fitzgerald show, but the principal told him there was no money.
do you wanna walk with me?
sure. - What's up?
so dad wrote me a check this morning for the dance marathon.
okay.
and when I got to his checkbook,
I found the ticket that was yours to the museum.
I guess it was in dad's car.
you didn't mention you borrowed his car.
Oh, no, well, I didn't think I had to.
why, did you have it on reserve for the night?
no, I'm... I'm just confused.
did you go to that exhibit or not?
well, to be perfectly honest, no.
I skipped it, and I went out to a really nice dinner instead.
by yourself?
no, uh, I was with a friend. I gotta get to class. I'll see you later.
are you reading that fast or fanning yourself?
what? Um, sorry.
where you going?
um, I left my lip gloss in the history stack. Gotta find it.
what do you want? - I'm calling in your debt.
two losers just bailed on what they owe me, and I need some cash right now.
okay, so what do you want me to do? Bust their kneecaps?
I don't want an enforcer. I want a date.
okay, absolutely not. - You're the homecoming queen, hanna.
you got a certain rep around here, and I need to borrow some of your cred.
what are you gonna do with it? - I need customers...With money...
who need to know they can trust me. - Yeah, well, they can't.
they can if I'm with you.
so you got a hot party tomorrow night?
I have a swim meet.
you can fit all of that under a cap? - I'm not swimming, freak.
I'm cheering on a friend.
what is the point of a swim-off?
why would the coach pit you against each other before a meet?
she's using our combined times to choose anchor, and right now, we're tied.
well, you'll change that.
maybe not. She wants it more.
Emily, you want it more, and it is okay to admit that.
peer TUTOR WANTED IN FRENCH 3 FOR HOME SCHOOLED STUDENT
you know who that's for, don't you?
what are you doing?
I might be interested. - Spencer, don't. You can't.
why not? Because you'd be going there for the wrong reason.
Really? Well, what if the same person who gave my name to the bead lady is the one who framed toby?
what if that was "a"? - Can't you find that out some other way?
without asking him? - Who else knows what he knows, emily?
if I can get him to talk - You won't even get him to look at you.
he doesn't trust us. He doesn't trust anyone anymore.
maybe, but if I have one piece of the puzzle and he has another, then we can put it together and maybe help each other.
you're a little early.
I just wanted to tell you I'm not coming to practice today.
why not?
I have another commitment.
you know, why don't you come in. Close the door.
I can't stay. I'm - No, come in.
what are you trying to pull here, spencer?
are you gonna tell your parents you can't stand to be on the same field with me so you're quitting the team?
I'm not quitting the team. I just have this other thing.
you can't avoid me.
I live in your backyard. - Well, this isn't about you. I'm...
look, I'm too concentrated in athletics, and it doesn't look good on my college applications.
so I just need to balance out my schedule.
knock-knock. - hey.
sorry to interrupt. - I thought you had a marketing seminar.
Oh, the professor cancelled. I brought the tile samples.
the contractor needs a decision. - Oh, great.
Bye. - Yeah, I think your sister's quitting the team.
Why? - I'm not quitting the team.
I'm just doing some tutoring.
well, anyone in particular?
Toby cavanaugh. - What?- What?
I signed up to help him with his french.
I can't believe the school would let anyone near him, especially alone.
why are you doing this? - I already told you.
what is this really about? That kid murdered one of your best friends.
wait, don't tell me you're falling for that silent martyr crap.
okay, you can't believe a thing that creep says.
well, toby cavanaugh hasn't cornered the market on lying.
I better to go.
Hi.
I - I noticed this was on the ground as I was walking up.
wait, I'm here to tutor you.
someone from the school called to tell you, didn't they?
why you? - Because I'm in a. p.French...
and I volunteered.
look, I have all your assignments together, and I worked out a schedule for the rest of the semester.
if we meet for three times a week, we can
you can't come in.
Jenna's home. - Okay.
well, is there somewhere else we can go?
I - I can't go somewhere else.
well, will jenna mind if we sit out here on the porch?
just don't think about it. It'll make you crazy.
how am I supposed to not think about it? It's too freaky.
if my mom's car hadn't stalled - Well, it did.
don't look a gift card in the mouth. The universe gave you a pass.
that's not the universe I know.
well, look, it all worked out, okay, and that's what counts.
maybe the universe got a little help from someone
someone with really good intentions.
that's great. I can pick you up.
I can find you in the dark. I've done it before.
okay, I'll see you soon. Bye.
Hey. So you're not going to that department dinner anymore?
Oh, no, no.
was that mom you were talking to?
uh, no, no, no, it wasn't.
so you sure you guys are gonna be okay here alone tonight?
sure. - Okay.
okay, look, aria, even if it wasn't the universe -.
I'm just saying if it's not a coincidence, then maybe
come on. - Where are we going?
to follow my dad. - Where?
if I knew that, we wouldn't have to follow him. - Aria...
han, my dad's about to have dinner with somebody in the dark. Move it.
I brought you something.
the heartcatcher?
it's catcher in the rye.
I guess there's no literal translation, but it helps to read a book you already know in english.
how do you know I've read it? - I saw you once...
at the apple rose grille. You were reading it.
what are you doing here?
uh, Mr. Carinci wants you to review the conditional tense - and the workbook- - What do you want?
what makes you think that I want something?
because you never do anything without a reason.
did emily tell you that? Nobody had to tell me that.
I think maybe you're being framed.
what changed your mind?
I think somebody might be trying to do the same thing to me.
maybe the same person.
how's that feel? - Not good.
scary.
why would somebody go after you?
what makes you so important?
I don't know.
maybe you know something you're not supposed to know.
well, every time I think I know something,
I get the rug pulled out from under me, and I end up on my ass.
c'est dommage.
I'm sorry...
for what I said about you and what I thought.
the sweater with alison's blood...
you said that you gave it to her that night.
I did. - And then she got into a car.
with some guy. I couldn't see who it was.
I'm not supposed to talk about this.
do you know how the sweater could've gotten back into your house?
uh, I have to go.
thanks for the book.
aren't scientists playing god?
how will it affect human health in the long term?
so I'm against it.
he's different.
how?
I meant, he's different than I thought he would be.
how have humans altered the genomes of species for thousands of years?
through artificial selection.
there's something about him that's...
I don't know.
a question spencer hastings can't answer? Interesting.
it's not that interesting.
am I finished with your homework? - you are.
thank you.
I keep trying to find a connection.
to toby?
to alison and toby.
me and toby.
we're pretty sure he didn't do it, right?
and yet somebody found a way to make him look extremely guilty.
Spence, you can't figure all that out sitting on his porch, conjugating verbs.
well, you don't know what those verbs are.
if he didn't tell you the first time, he probably can't.
are you sure he even wants you to come back?
Yeah, I think he does.
why is my dad walking into our high school?
okay, weird.
not really. I mean, think about it.
he's probably just going to see your mom. - Em, that's ridiculous.
people lie, aria. I mean, hello?
well, what are they doing?
call your mother.
right now. Call your mom.
Hi, aria, honey. I was just thinking about you.
is everything okay? - yeah. Why wouldn't it be okay?
uh, well, I didn't mean to suggest that everything wasn't okay.
I was just asking, checking, wondering, like moms do.
where are you?
home.
where are you?
home.
okay, so everything's okay then? - Yeah.
okay, I'll talk to you later, sweetie. Bye -bye.
okay, well, she says she's home. Do you believe her?
I don't know.
what are you doing?
that's not good.
what? You used to like it.
no, no, not that, this - The lying, the sneaking around. I feel like a teenager.
Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?
listen, we should just tell the kids.
we can't. We can't tell them until we know what this is.
okay, I think I got everything. Let's go.
watch out for that.
Oh, my god, my parents are having an affair with each other!
what are you doing? - Come up here.
Hurry!
what are you looking at?
this. Someone sending a bunch of texts?
Spencer's laptop disappearing? Our lockers broken into?
all this stuff happened at school. This is "a.
let's just get out of here. Come on.
Hanna, you're taking that?
Yes,"a" owes me - Hospital bills, pain and suffering, tire marks on my cleavage.
it's-it's nothing. The lights are probably on a timer.
we should go.
how's your eye? Any better?
it's still burning. You want a sharp stick for the other one?
it was just hair spray. It was light hold.
what were you doing in there anyway? - I'm sort of, um...
I'm crashing here. - You are? Why?
what do you care? - Don't snap at her like that. I have more.
fire away.
just give me my money back first.
where do your parents think you are?
my foster parents don't care where I am...
as long as they keep getting their checks.
wait, I thought all that stuff about the social worker was a joke.
believe me, my social worker is a joke, but, yeah, I do have one.
this is crazy. You can't keep staying here.
there's hot water, vending machines, the principal's couch is pretty comfortable.
well, they know someone was here last night.
I got sloppy.
where are you going?
grab some dinner, then back to bed.
you know your way out, right?
are you okay?
no.
what happened?
you have every reason to hate me.
I don't even know why I'm here.
I don't hate you.
I would. I do.
don't say that.
I'm sorry, emily.
I just wanted you to know that.
wait, paige...
good morning, sharks. How we all doing today?
ready to swim, coach!
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
ready to swim, coach!
that's what I'm talking about, all right.
it's our last practice before this afternoon's big meet, so let's make it a good one.
Emily, there's not gonna be a swim-off.
I just got word that paige will not be joining us.
why not?
she had an accident while riding her bike last night.
she's just a little banged-up.
she'll be back swimming in no time.
okay, ladies, in the water, in the water! Come on!
you're late. Let's go in.
wait, can we talk about last night?
what is there to talk about?
the fact that you're hiding out in the a. v.
closet until graduation.
what's your plan?
all right, do you wanna play guidance counselor or do you wanna pay off your debt?
I'm cashing in on that favor.
point out the kids who have money to burn.
fine, I'll trade you - One name for one answer.
Hey, bridget. - Hey, hanna.
you know my friend caleb, right? - Sort of.
Hey.
Bridget wu - Total party girl.
bring her a bottle of something strong, and she's your new best friend.
where are you from?
a lot of places. - I gave details.
Seattle, salt lake, denver, chicago, and here.
your turn.
don't let the jesus sandals fool you.
she's got cash.
her grandfather invented the stapler.
nice.
wana get tight with her?
grow a hipster 'stache and start talking about "the man.
why don't you report your foster parents?
to who? My social worker?
I've had four in the last six months.
they can't remember my name.
the last one called me "calvin.
when's the last time you saw your real parents?
it's gonna take a lot more than names to hear about them.
truce. Got you a button.
Thanks. - No problem.
I need to be super rah-rah now that I'm the coach's wife.
it's a swim meet. It's not even his sport.
and what's yours, brother-in-law bashing?
what's going on between you and ian?
why don't you ask him?
something wrong with that picture?
I see my husband buying us hot dogs, and I see you going out of your way to humiliate him.
what was that lying crack about?
he does nothing but try with you, spencer.
when are you gonna give him a break? - Honestly?
when I figure out why he rushed back to rosewood and rushed into proposing to you.
no, you've got it wrong.
I proposed. I wanted to elope.
you have a problem with my marriage, you take it up with me, not him.
well, him is the problem.
he's not been entirely honest with you, and I'm worried about you.
about what?
you have to ask him about alison, about what happened the summer that she was killed.
you really are too much.
did toby cavanaugh put that idea in your head?
Hey. Sorry I took so long.
they were out of the spicy mustard you like.
did I miss something?
no, we were just talking about alison.
Ian, I'll meet you inside. - Okay.
look, I've already lost one relationship because of you.
you will not ruin my marriage, too.
Melissa. - Coming.
when's emily gonna jump in?
she's the anchor.
she swims last 'cause she's the fastest.
Hey, remind me, which one's lindsay and which one's bridget?
Bridget's the one drinking from her purse.
Thanks. I'll be right back.
come on, come on, come on!
why are we sitting with caleb? - Why not?
Hanna, I like stray dogs, too, but sometimes they bite.
well, he's had his shots.
go, emily! - She's not swimming yet.
you know what? I'm gonna take the long way home.
okay, I'll see you later. - bye.
almost got you buster. Wanna know how? Ask hanna!--A
what's this?
my eviction notice.
sorry.
you know that I didn't tell anybody.
I didn't go there.
well, maybe it's for the best.
I mean, the place had small closets.
I hated that shirt anyway.
consider your debt paid. Have a good day.
Hey, If you need a place to stay-- - No, thanks.
your mom starts asking questions, someone calls social services, and it's just a big mess.
wait.
there's an old couch in my basement.
my mom will never know.
Hanna. Hey.
here you are.
you're not gonna believe what this sick freak did now.
what are you talking about? - Look.
almost got you buster. Wanna know how? Ask hanna!--A
I have to say,"a" is smart - Trying to pit us against each other.
Yeah, aria-- - It's relentless.
every time we shut a door,"a" kicks open a window.
I gave your mom the museum ticket.
what?
why would you do that? - "a" made me do it.
a" has something on me.
a" has something on all of us, hanna, but there's nothing "a" could threaten me with that would make me do that to you.
you're supposed to be my best friend.
I know, and as soon as I put the ticket in your mom's mailbox,
I did everything I could to undo it.
the reason your mom didn't get-- - Stop talking.
there's nothing you could say that would change the way I feel right now.
you okay?
you didn't return any of my calls. - I'm fine.
it's nothing.
I didn't know what to say.
I was riding home on my bike and totally wiped out.
what were you thinking about?
how easy thing's would be if I wiped out.
I'm kind of done with swimming.
I used to feel that way. - Obviously you got over it.
how did you get over it?
I started swimming for myself.
I quit trying be better than everyone on the team, and I just relaxed.
sounds fun.
when's the last time you swam for fun?
Hey.
Hi, I got your message, but I didn't totally understand.
this isn't going to work.
here, take it back.
Toby, I came here because I thought that we could help each other.
we can't.
just take it and go.
incoming Caller Hanna question.
what's up?
the towels in the bathroom
are they like the fancy people-are-coming-over towels?
no, you can use them.
I don't have to. I can shake off and air dry.
please don't.
what's going on?
you want me to leave?
it's not about you.
Aria's really, really mad at me.
you know that thing I told you not to leak?
she found out anyway?
she's never gonna speak to me again.
you don't have to sit here and listen to this.
just go take your shower.
it can wait.
good night. - Wait, spencer.
can we talk about earlier? - No.
it's late, and I'm tired.
I know about you and ian.
he told me everything
the thing you two had when we were broken up.
I can't hold that against you.
did he tell you anything else about that summer?
whatever it is you're holding onto, it's got to stop.
I think he's dangerous. - And I think you need help.
you keep wanting what I have.
you know what, melissa?
Spencer, I don't want to fight.
I realize that I lost my temper earlier, and I'm sorry.
I've been a little hormonal lately, and I guess I should tell you.
tell me what?
we're pregnant.
this is where you say,"congratulations.
good night, sis.
I found this in Jenna's room. you may be right. - Toby
for families, friends, civic groups or clubs.
by listening to these long-playing, hi-fidelity records, you can speak fluently in as little as six weeks.
we're going to start with the french verb etre, which means "to be.
ready? Let's begin.
Pret? Commencons.
je suis. I am...Je suis. I am...Je suis. I am...Je suis.
I never told the police where you were.
do you believe me?
that's what I asked you ...
before the cops picked me up.
I never got an answer, either.
the D. A. Is dropping the charges against me.
I'm free.
we can get that awful thing off your leg right now.
the cab is waiting.
I'm going with Spencer.
well, how did you like Mr. Fitz?
every English department has one, full of charm and promise.
this is crazy.
you can't keep staying here.
Hey, if you need a place to stay, there's an old couch in my basement.
my mom will never know.
I figured out what the message means.
it wasn't b-a-d.
it was the number 214.
all em, all the time!
don't tell.
whatever it is you're holding on to, it's got to stop.
come closer.
I think he's dangerous.
and I think you need help.
Spencer, we're pregnant.
Fitz, this is Byron Montgomery.
I'm sorry about how our meeting went, and I'd like to talk to you, so maybe we could have a beer?
if you're trying out for the bad seed,
you need to sign up here and wait by the auditorium door
until your name is called.
thank you, and good luck.
start with the line about the stolen medal.
why isn't she wearing any shoes?
so she can look short enough to play an eight-year-old.
what's my line?
I don't see anything about a medal.
no, that's what the eight-year-old killed her classmate for.
penmanship medal.
that's why they call her the bad seed.
a penmanship medal, really?
didn't you read the whole play?
don't look at me.
Hanna's the one trying out.
I'm just here to make her look taller.
why do I have to read the whole play?
I don't wanna be the bad seed's mother.
I want the other mother, the one who's drunk all the time.
no comment.
are you still ragging on me for bringing a flask to a dance?
I don't need another parent, Spence.
one's plenty.
well, has the one figured out that Caleb's in your basement?
no, but "A" has.
what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna tell my mom before "A" gets to her.
I'm just gonna ask her if Caleb can stay in the guestroom.
Hey, there, Hanna and her clanna!
Hey, Mona. How'd it go in there?
honestly, I nailed it. It was epic.
I think Mr. Fitz cried.
good for you, Mona.
I guess the rest of us should go home.
No!
there are no small parts, only parts that don't make it into the yearbook.
good luck.
why don't you audition?
you kind of have an in with the director.
stop.
is he wearing the tie you gave him?
stop!
it would be so awesome to hang out with you two after school, see you as a couple.
news flash.
just 'cause we're on this side of the building
doesn't mean that we can suddenly light candles and slow dance.
that's the opening night party.
Hello, Aria.
Hello, Ezra.
are you finished?
it's not like we'll ever be able to go on a double date with you guys.
you won't even send us pictures.
pictures?
Hanna, we meet at his apartment. It's not sea world.
we're just saying it'd be nice.
believe me, I know.
wish I could.
but I can't.
um, where's your other scene?
is Mr. Fitz in the auditorium?
uh, I'm, uh, right here, Jenna.
what can I do for you?
I don't know if you're interested,
but I would like to compose some music for the play.
sure. That'd be great.
for the flute? - Yes.
is there a reason that you picked the bad seed?
it's one of my favorites.
the theme is so inspiring.
uh, inspiring?
I'm fascinated by the nature of evil.
Oh, hey. Didn't, uh, wake you, did I?
sort of.
are you packing or unpacking?
uh, little bit of both.
you know, I gotta make room.
babies come with a lot of gear.
Yeah, it's time I get rid of some of this dead weight.
what's in there?
junk, mostly.
yearbooks.
baseball gloves, trophies.
stuff my mom probably wants more than me.
listen, can you, uh, hold this flap down for me?
it's a tape gun, spence.
you won't get hurt.
I know that. - Really?
'cause you flinch every time I come near you.
have to go get ready for school.
Yeah, Melissa told me what you said to her at the swim meet.
you think I had something to do with what happened to alison de laurentis?
well, for the record, I didn't ...
though I'm not surprised she ended up that way.
what is that supposed to me?
it means your friend alison was a psycho stalker
who wouldn't take no for an answer.
okay, someone else probably had enough of her.
Yeah, or maybe you had enough of her.
listen, our relationship could be summed up in two words: Get lost.
right, well, it's too bad she's not here to defend herself.
trust me, she never played that position.
your friend alison was always on offense.
didn't I just buy this milk?
is it sour?
empty.
and ...
so is the butter dish.
why are we going through so many groceries?
I may have made some mac & cheese for Caleb and me.
he stayed over for dinner a couple times.
I thought we talked about this.
I'm not crazy about this friendship.
mom, his home situation sucks.
his foster parents treat him like dirt.
Hanna, there are a lot of great families out there. He could be placed with, just not ours.
and ... There's no sugar, either.
uh, yeah, we made brownies for dessert.
so, I guess this would be a bad time to see
if he can stay in our guestroom for a couple nights?
Ah, so the cat in the hat now wants room and board?
he never asked. I'm asking.
I mean, how do you expect him to study or get a good night's sleep?
Hanna, we need our privacy.
Mrs. Potter's nephew is still circling out there.
we're not in the clear.
I applaud your compassion, but I worry about your judgment.
so, is that a maybe?
and now I'm worried about your hearing.
I'm late. I love you.
she's gone.
morning.
how much did you hear?
between you and mommy?
not much.
I will, uh, put some groceries on the back porch.
my parting gift.
Caleb, chill. I'll talk to her.
she'll come around.
said the girl with poor judgment to the cat in the hat.
surprise.
uh, hey. What's this? - Your newspaper.
I don't subscribe.
w-what's up? What are you doing here?
nothing. I just wanted to talk to you before school.
about your dad wanting to take me out for that beer?
I don't have to do it, aria.
I can dodge him.
no, don't dodge him.
I want you to spend some quality time with him.
Why?
because. It'd be cool if my dad could see how special you are.
I want my friends to see that, too.
and why do we suddenly care what your friends think about me?
have you told them about us?
your homies will like me just fine.
I cast spencer and hanna in the school play.
Really?
excellent. They'll be so psyched.
who's your stage manager?
Ah, couple of kids have asked.
Why?
well, you'll be spending every day after school and weekends ...
so if I'm stage managing we can see each other all the time.
on campus.
off campus, too.
it'll give us an excuse to finally have coffee outside this little apartment.
I love this little apartment. I do. A lot.
come on. Let me be your stage manager, please?
part of me says this is a terrible idea.
but I'm not talking to that part.
just say yes, ezra. Come on, just say it. Say it.
Yes.
Caleb, can you get me my mascara?
I'm in the shower!
can I just come in and grab it?
sure.
you know, if you guys cleaned this showerhead,
you could have amazing pressure.
go for it.
is my phone in your bathroom?
um, I-I-- I'm in the shower, mom!
I was halfway to the bank when I realized I didn't have it.
what is with this charger?
I only have three bars.
uh, I really can't talk right now, mom.
I'm getting shampoo in my mouth.
okay. All right. See you at dinner.
wanna share a towel, too?
that's awesome.
that's the part you really wanted, right?
Yeah! It's pretty cool.
if you guys are all involved, maybe I should do props or something.
why is Paige Mccullers calling?
is she still torturing you?
no, she's-- we're cool now.
Really?
what brought you closer, her trying to drown you?
she's got a cousin in the military, and she's kind of anxious about it.
did you and toby figure out that braille thing yet, what 214 means?
you haven't given up, have you?
definitely not.
we're still working on it.
I'm supposed to drop off his french book after school, so ...
can I do it?
I haven't seen him since they dropped the charges,
and I'd kind of like to talk to him again.
Yeah.
maybe now he'll be more willing to hear me
when I say I didn't turn him in.
what are you looking at?
I didn't even know they knew each other.
there's a lot of things that we don't know.
what is that?
what did he just give her?
so the play are people born evil, or do they learn it?
I brought some additional material
to give you guys some background on the period.
what gives, velma?
did you have a nasty dream last night about shaggy?
I was in the shower with him.
Oh, talk about a wet dream.
no, it wasn't a dream.
he took a shower at my place.
did you lose your v-card?
No! Nothing happened.
well, that was a waste of water.
are you into him or not?
okay, you know, I'm just confused.
decide soon.
bad boy only showers once a year.
do you need help?
Oh, no, I'm good, thanks.
so, I recommend that you read the novel, and to whet your appetites,
I copied the first chap
I-I got it. Thanks.
why don't you hand out the schedules?
Oh, Aria, uh, while you're up, could you do me a favor?
uh, sure. What do you need, Mona?
could you hit the vendy and grab me a powerbar and some mints?
I think I should just pass these out,
but everyone can "hit the vendy" when we go on break, okay?
I think you'll see, even with the novel, Rhoda is not the typical eight-year-old.
only the janitor is
Yes.
uh, I'm guessing this isn't the varsity booster club.
my bad. Sorry.
let's all take a look at the first scene with Rhoda and the janitor, if you'll turn to page 25.
he is so creepy!
I can't believe you ever kissed him.
we all wanted to kiss him.
never.
at that frat party when he was big man on campus?
the one that Alison got us into?
not me.
Yes. You.
you are so bad-ass.
did you make these?
Where'd you get this picture of me?
I look like my mother.
that is your mother.
so, you guys can thank me later.
wait!
so ... What do we-- what do we do now?
act your new age.
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.
Hey, spence, isn't that your sister's new boyfriend?
Really? That's what I thought. Are you--?
he's kinda cute.
so's his friend.
easy. He's a little bit old for you.
not tonight ... 'cause I'm 26!
put that away.
Yeah, and take a math class. You're 21.
okay. All right. Just right up here.
looks like Mr. Melissa is giving miss rum & coke a special tour.
maybe he's just taking her to the bathroom.
or finding an empty room so she can lie down.
Yeah, on top of her.
what?
look, I don't know about you vestal virgins,
but I'm here to make some memories.
let's divide and conquer and meet back here at midnight.
you should've said something to your sister that night.
like what?
I crashed your boyfriend's frat party"?
I would've been so dead.
like your sister isn't now?
Yeah, knocked up with his bad seed.
Hanna, why do you think that the janitor in the play
is the only one who knows the little girl's not a liar?
um, that's because the janitor is childlike himself.
it's like when we were reading shakespeare,
and Ezra talked about the fools and how they can get away with saying ...
things that ...
other people can't.
let's just focus on this play.
okay?
Hi.
Spencer asked me to drop off your french book.
there a reason she didn't want to?
no. Not at all.
I practically snatched it out of her hand.
I wanted to.
I should be on your porch.
I found out who turned me in.
it was Jenna.
her way of keeping me close to home.
well, no one can do that now.
it must feel good, knowing you can ride that whenever you want.
it'll feel even better when I can get it to move.
so, I was thinking ...
maybe we could go out sometime and celebrate, now that this is over.
what happened to Maya?
I meant celebrate as friends.
breakfast or something.
I like breakfast.
tomorrow?
don't tell me you're still working.
no, just prepping.
I like to fool myself into thinking
they actually read some of the things I put up here.
well, hope springs eternal.
look at you, you're teaching, writing,
directing the school play.
do you even have time for a beer?
sure. Just, uh, don't tell my students.
it'll only make them love you more, if that were even possible.
my daughter thinks that you are pretty hot stuff.
and you know what?
after reading your stories that Aria gave me, I have to agree.
but I gotta say, it's very bold of you,
exposing yourself to your students.
come on. You look like you need that beer.
okay, pick up the coat, move stage left, and then push him out the door.
can he have lunch first?
I ... Wasn't talking to you.
Oh, you have someone crashing in your attic, too?
no. I'm learning my lines.
can I help? - Nope.
can I make the sandwich? - No.
so, how was the rest of your day?
mine got off to a really strange start. I was taking a shower
Yeah, you know what, you can make a sandwich, and you can eat it, too.
I have to practice being drunk.
can I ... Help? - No!
Thanks.
here you go.
you know, when you talk about your writing,
you seem much more relaxed than when you talk about your day job.
you're not hiding out at that high school, are you?
what?
listen, Ezra, I have known many gifted people
who were too scared to bet on their own talent.
no, no. No. Not me.
I love teaching high school.
Oh, of course you do.
I mean, everybody always loves their first class.
you bond with them in a special way,
but don't forget
the same kids that you love are gonna move on, you know?
you know, time goes by so fast.
I mean, Aria's already looking at colleges in California.
you know, if you taught at the college level,
you'd have a lot more time for your writing.
I need your help.
what's going on?
I saw Ian hand Jenna a bag at school.
so?
well, do you have any idea what was in it?
no.
why do they even know each other?
he's a coach.
what team does she play on?
I don't want to have to ask Jenna.
we're not talking much these days.
you don't have to talk to her. Just ...
get her phone.
what?
we have to find out if Ian is in her recent call lists,
and Hanna has a friend who can unlock her password.
I'm not stealing her phone.
Toby, we're no closer to figuring out what 214 means.
Ian might be who she's whispering to on the other end.
I don't know. If-- I've gotta be careful. If I start stealing
for the next piece of evidence to be planted in your room.
until they find the real killer, your nightmare is never going to end.
we need Jenna's phone.
morning.
is that Emily?
Yes.
Toby's not here.
or are you here to see me?
he's not here?
we made a-- I said I'd take him out for breakfast.
well, he's having that with Spencer.
he left early this morning. Said he needed to do homework.
it sucks, doesn't it?
what?
feeling like you're second choice.
how soon can I get it back?
shouldn't take him long.
have you eaten? You want some toast? Is whole wheat okay?
she goes ballistic when I touch her stuff.
Yeah, I get it.
my sister once threatened to break my thumbs for using her hairbrush.
Toby, can I ask you something?
why was Alison so sure it was you
spying on us the night of Jenna's accident?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
I never spied on anyone.
I never looked in anyone's window.
your friend Alison made that up.
Why?
why you?
because she thought she had something on me.
she-- she didn't understand what was really going on, and she used it against me anyway.
well, it seems like she had something on all of us.
maybe, but you don't have to live in a town where everyone believes you killed her.
not everyone.
you did.
Yeah. I guess I did.
but I'm not proud of that.
this whole Alison thing has never made any sense to me.
it still doesn't.
Hey. You're ... already taping.
I thought you wanted me to.
I do.
just not sure we'll have people up on their feet yet.
look.
I'm sorry about slipping up yesterday,
but I don't think anyone picked up on it.
Oh, they did.
I'll be more careful. I promise.
so how was that beer with my dad?
What'd you two talk about?
lots of stuff.
he offered to help me get a job at Hawes college.
Why? You already have a job.
but there's one class available there,
and it could lead to something more.
why would you need something more?
truth is, I ...
need something less.
if I worked at Hawes, I would have more time to do my own writing.
Yeah, but teaching here hasn't kept you from your writing, has it?
not entirely, but I gotta think about the future.
so, you're planning on leaving here?
maybe, eventually.
but you are, too ...
leaving eventually, right?
Oh, hey, Mr. Fitz.
Oh, Aria, um, I'm a little parched.
have you had a chance to pick me up some throat coat?
um, you're gonna have to go get your own tea, Mona.
I'm a stage manager, not a gopher.
you sure bite like one.
where did you get this?
the year 2020?
it's for someone who can't see.
okay.
well, someone who can, might need to call NASA to turn it on.
uh, take however long you need.
no. Take an hour.
it has to be returned as soon as possible, or the person who ...Borrowed it might be in trouble.
they should be.
stealing a blind person's phone?
that's sick.
what do you like to do for fun on the weekends, break old lady's hips?
just give it back to Spencer as soon as you can, okay?
where does my character sit?
uh, I haven't blocked it yet, Mona.
we'll get to that on Saturday.
for those of you just arriving,
the stage has been taped off to mark the living room,
and the prop table is being stocked as I speak.
wait, this Saturday?
I can't be here this Saturday.
I only sent the e-mail to those who were called for that rehearsal.
well, am I called in or not?
we'll be blocking that scene on Saturday.
I thought I mentioned that.
you didn't.
Mr. Fitz, can we find a way to work out the kinks in the system?
I assure you, Mona, from this point on Aria will be on top of things.
I just need some clarification from our director on the scheduling.
can we take five, everyone? Thanks.
are you still angry at me about yesterday?
I'm angry at myself because ...
I knew this wasn't gonna work.
fine. I will help you find a new stage manager,
but it sounds like you're trying to replace me in other parts of your life.
who said that? - You did.
suddenly, everybody's leaving here.
and why were you talking about your future versus our future?
because they may not be linked.
look, I'm not saying I'm leaving here tomorrow,
but, let's face it-- We are not tied to this place forever.
you're looking at colleges in California,
which you have every right to do.
one. I looked at one college in your favorite city.
we could move there together!
Aria, that's not how it works.
why can't it if we want it to?
the whole point of college is to broaden your world,
not pack up your high school English teacher and bring him with you.
you're not just my high school English teacher.
is that how you see yourself?
no.
but you will, when the time comes.
cute couple, aren't they?
we should study our lines.
Yeah, I still don't get my second scene.
your character is suspicious.
it doesn't say that in the script.
that's because it's underneath the words.
that's the reason why she's drinking.
no, she's drinking because her kid drowned.
Hanna, at this point even the little girl's mother thinks that she's a murderer.
it's the drowning, the old lady who fell down the stairs,
the janitor who was set on fire ...
I was just talking about this scene.
she could think it was an accident.
maybe there are no accidents.
what do you mean?
we never questioned what happened at that party.
all right, I'll see you guys later, okay?
Hey, mike, I want to see pictures.
I really like that top, em ...
and I think someone else might like it, too.
no.
Why? He's drooling in his beer pong cup.
just go talk to him.
no. - Go talk to him!
are you okay?
don't touch her!
I'm gonna go get help!
somebody call 911!
she's still breathing.
we should go. Now.
why didn't you tell us about Ian at the top of the stairs before?
I ... I didn't think about it till now.
what if that girl didn't fall just 'cause she was wasted?
we're ... Starting.
what's going on?
the night that we crashed that frat party.
Yeah, what about it?
we're thinking Alison wasn't the first person Ian shoved.
I can't do this right now.
this phone is out of my league.
I can't crack it, and I know you're dealing with a time issue.
you're just gonna give up?
this is important!
Why? Why are you breaking and entering Jenna Cavanaugh's phone?
it's none of your business.
how'd you know it was Jenna's?
because I'm not blind.
are you gonna get over what happened yesterday morning?
because I can have that tattoo removed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
so, what do you think?
are people born bad?
I'm having a hard time figuring out who's evil and who's just naughty.
I think you know the difference, Mona, but let's ask some of your castmates.
Spencer. Thoughts?
Yes. Some people are pure evil.
we should get out of here. They're gonna start questioning everyone.
we can't leave without Alison!
I voted for mini golf. This was a huge mistake.
what's going on? What happened?
you missed it? Where were you?
that-- that girl that was with Ian-- She fell down the stairs, and it was terrible.
can we just tell her on the bus?
note to self: Don't drink and dive.
if my mom finds out I was here, I'm gonna be grounded until I'm 50.
guys, if we run away like babies, we'll definitely be questioned.
what is she doing?
excuse me.
my friends and I made the mistake of having a little drink before we ate,
and none of us feel comfortable about getting behind the wheel.
can we trouble you for a ride back to Rosewood?
what-- what are you thinking?
I'm thinking we're not taking the bus.
chillax, ladies.
the bolder the move, the less anyone questions it.
I think my character's being totally selfish.
I don't even know how to play that.
miss Verne is protecting the future of her school, Mona.
so, is she forgivable or not?
it's unforgivable if she's only thinking of herself.
let's stop here.
these are all good thoughts. We'll pick up where we left off tomorrow.
study your lines. Put away your props.
I'll see you then.
guys.
what are we looking at?
why would that be in here?
what's that? - Is that blood?
em, where did you get this?
I didn't! I've never seen it before.
Oh, god, no.
you think that's what Ian used-- to kill Alison, don't you?
guys, slow down.
we don't know that that's Alison's blood.
we don't even know if that is blood.
Yeah, but we don't know that it's not.
that's insane.
why would he hide that in here for everyone to see?
because it's a bold move, and no one would ever look for it here.
why did the bad seed hide the medal in the box on top of her desk?
why didn't she just bury it?
because she was eight!
guys, we all saw that video.
Ian did not have a trophy in his hand.
we didn't see what was on the ground.
it could've been in his luggage.
this was when they were together at Hilton head.
what are we gonna do?
we hand it in.
we're not wasting time losing evidence again.
Emily's right.
this goes to the police now.
so, what revealing your do we do now?
just wait.
how long until the police figure out that it's Alison's blood?
I don't know.
I'll tell you this-- I don't want to go home.
I don't want to be anywhere near where Ian is.
you can stay at my place.
could we just all stay at your place?
I don't know, it just feels weird splitting up after this.
I can't believe we had it, the weapon, in our hands.
after all this time, it's like ...
like Ali can finally rest in peace.
Yeah. We all can.
we'll pick up some food on the way to Emily's.
I-I can't stay over tonight.
look, believe me, I don't want to go home either,
but my mom hears something in the basement ...
you haven't told her about Caleb?
there's only so much I can do in one day, okay?
actually, can we just make one stop along the way?
I-I promise it won't take long.
Yeah, sure.
wait, em. We didn't call Toby.
what? - We have to tell him what we found.
you tell him. That should be you.
sorry to bother you, but I'm-- I'm not sleeping tonight until I say this.
take your coat off. Sit down.
no, no. I'm not staying.
I just came here to say that I signed up for the play for all the wrong reasons,
so I'm officially done.
you're right, it was a terrible idea.
Aria- - but you were wrong too ...
about the future.
you have no idea what's gonna happen tomorrow.
nobody does.
my friend Alison, she didn't.
she didn't get a future.
she didn't even get to turn 16.
listen- - no, but let me finish.
I don't know if I'm gonna end up in California,
or some fishing village in Guam-- it doesn't matter.
we're both here now.
can't we just be happy that we have that?
good answer.
didn't take anything that wasn't mine, officer.
are you leaving?
I thought you'd be relieved.
why would you think that?
because you've been treating me like something you scrape off your shoe?
at least, since our shower.
look ... I know. I just ... I wasn't ...
ready to see that much of me?
no.
Yes.
what, and now you think you have to throw down, too?
what if I don't want to?
it's okay.
what if I do want to?
that's okay, too.
did you guys sleep at all? - No.
just tossed and turned.
she tossed. I turned.
I cannot wait for him to be carted out of here.
just knowing that he's in this building now -
thinking he could get away with it.
her blood in that trophy case.
makes me sick.
guys. Oh, my god.
they're going to drag him out in front of the whole school.
why is he coming over here?
ladies.
which one of you found the trophy?
who's, uh, Spencer Hastings?
so, was this a group effort, or are you three just along for the ride?
what do you mean?
I mean, you should've done a little research.
there's no golf tournament on Hilton head on that date.
what about the blood?
it's not human blood.
comes from a rat.
no, but why would there -
let's save our questions for the precinct.
follow me.
detective Breyer?
rat me out, your blood's next --A "A" planted that trophy.
we should've known.
guys, where was she that night?
at the frat party when the girl fell, where was Alison?
she wasn't with us.
she wasn't with us, either.
what are you saying?
I'm saying maybe it wasn't Ian who pushed that girl.
maybe-- maybe that drunk girl was just in Alison's way.
why would Alison do that?
because that frat party wasn't a random pick.
she took us there because she wanted to see Ian.
maybe she was stalking him.
wait, so now you believe Ian?
you don't think he killed Alison?
I didn't say that.
I think he killed her.
there's just a lot about that night that was still don't know.
Oh, my god.
what?
what if Jenna was also blocking her way to Ian?
what if Ali threw that firecracker in Toby's garage knowing that Jenna was in there?
she had us all fooled ...
until now.
I'm not ashamed of who I am, but I used to be, liars ...
and if we have to hide like this all the time,
I'm gonna start to feel that way again.
the lying, the sneaking around-- I feel like a teenager.
Yeah. It's fun, isn't it?
I found this in the basement.
just go ...
and don't come back.
welcome home, honey.
I understand why you're so fond of Mr. Fitz.
he takes such a personal interest in his students.
where have you been? - With caleb.
we camped out.
I figured out what the message means.
it wasn't b-a-d, it was the number 2-1-4.
does that number mean anything to you?
it could be anything.
we have to figure it out ...
for both our sakes.
you can stay here for a short time, in the guest room.
thank you.
I did it for hanna, not you.
I can't do this anymore.
it's over. I'm out.
we're trying to help you, but you need to start Being completely honest with us.
the police are waiting in the living room.
they know you lied to them.
what's going on in there?
Spencer hastings now a person of interest ...in my death.
I feel like whole parts of my brain have shut down.
I used to love algebra, or at least I understood it.
and now it's a mess.
well, it can get really abstract.
Yeah, but that's what I liked about it. You know?
X's, y's, z's-- none of it real.
I could deal with that.
you just isolate the x factor.
and now I feel like I'm the x factor.
honey, where were you?
we stopped along the way at emily's.
now, don't worry, I was expecting this.
it's mostly about intimidation, So I want you to stay calm.
stay calm about what?
they served a search warrant.
a search warrant?
for where? For what?
the house, the barn, your room- - My room?
Spencer, don't interfere.
honey.
make them get out.
I can't.
your a person of interest in a murder investigation.
they're just doing their job.
in an especially ham-fisted way.
what are they looking for?
things that connect you to alison ...
and what happened to her.
and started going through her things?
let me call you back, them.
okay, bye.
good morning.
good morning.
Hey, uh, listen, your mom called.
she's gonna be swinging by for coffee, See if you guys want a lift to school.
she's coming for coffee?
Yeah, that's right.
so the kitchen table exists in another dimension Where that already happened?
I heard the door slam.
was that mom, or was that somebody else?
no.
no, that was, uh, your mom.
so she was already here this morning.
why does she have to leave and fake coming back?
because she wasn't just here this morning, She was here last night.
mom was here all night?
listen, when your brother comes down,
we're gonna talk about this.
wait. You snuck mom into your room last night?
technically, you cannot sneak into your own house.
I'm gonna remember that.
hey- - Hey!
did your dad tell you I called?
I was just around the corner So I thought I'd take you to school.
we're busted.
you slept here last night?
it just sort of happened.
you guys, you're-- you're getting back together?
we don't know.
N-no--we're trying to figure that out.
you don't look surprised.
what's wrong? - Nothing.
nothing's wrong.
we were just talking about How things might change around here.
I don't need any more of that.
no, your mom means maybe change back.
we're thinking about trying something.
you coming back?
well, I mean, that's something that we need to discuss As a family.
well, how about dinner?
Mike and I could make you guys dinner.
what do you think?
sounds ...Good.
Yeah, sounds good.
are you going to school?
okay. Later.
what happened?
the police were at spencer's house.
they had a search warrant.
well, what are they looking for?
salt?
no, thanks.
so, you said the cops were at spencer's house?
good morning.
morning.
okay, caleb, The second floor is all yours.
I'll grab a shower.
fried eggs, burned butter -
the kitchen hasn't smelled like this in a long time.
well, it's a good smell.
I like it.
just don't let him make you late to school.
I won't.
he can finish this on the way.
see you tonight. - Okay.
it's so pretty, Hanna.
when did he give it to you?
he hasn't given it to me, not yet.
I found it.
and I wasn't looking for it, but I found it,
and I took a picture, and then I just put it back.
why an owl?
it's symbolic.
of what?
of our first night In the tent.
we heard owls.
swooping down to carry off their prey?
you cannot stop the romance.
owls and tents and s'mores are all part of that night -
every perfect minute of it.
have you two had ...
another opportunity?
not since he went in the guest room, but we do have plans.
apples and spice?
Yeah, it's really good for you. Healthy, which is nice.
when did that start to happen?
yeah? That's awesome. Are you captain? - Yeah.
nice. Me too.
don't worry about it.
it's totally cool.
I mean, the breakup was way messy, but sean's a good guy.
I mean, he should be happy.
everybody should be as happy as I am.
you know, maybe I should practice my surprise face when he gives it to me.
Hey. Are you okay?
Yeah, we didn't think you were coming in today.
I have to be someplace other than my house.
are the cops still there?
they came and went.
they actually took things?
not so much.
my mom says they did it just to shake me up.
What'd they take?
um, things from my jewelry box, Stuff from my closet, a couple of pairs of shoes
wait. Not the tory burches.
no, sneakers.
they wanted my laptop, but my mom said no,
it wasn't in the search warrant and they couldn't have it.
look, you guys should know that there's a chance That they might try to pull this on you.
search our rooms?
my mom says it's a possibility.
I'm so sorry.
no-- it's not your fault.
we know who's responsible for this.
I should have known that that trophy was some kind of trap.
it's like I can hear "a" laughing in my head.
does "a" sound like jenna?
it's my mom.
she wants me to come home.
walk me out, okay? - Sure.
Aria, come on.
just a second.
Hey, emily, got a second?
I have to get all the way over to the annex.
can I walk you?
sure.
I just want to ask you something. - Okay.
you're teammates with paige mccullers, right?
right.
is she seeing anybody?
cause I like her, she's fun, But I don't want anything complicated right now.
I don't know, sean.
Paige isn't really my friend.
Oh. Oh, I get it. I shouldn't be asking you.
your hanna's friend.
I'm way out of line.
no, sean, that's okay.
Hanna saw you at the table with paige.
she said you've got every right to be happy.
she said that?
I think she meant it.
as for paige, we swim on the same team,
but I don't know her that well.
gotcha. Thanks.
so tell me, how long have you known about your father and me?
you told us this morning.
I guess I just sort of had a feeling something was up.
and are you okay with that?
Yeah, I'm beyond okay.
as long as it's what you and dad want.
well, this part really isn't about us.
it's about you and your brother.
we miss you.
I miss you.
and I wish you could come home.
hold that thought.
and by the way, it's my experience
that you should always check before you press send.
I don't think you meant this for me.
mom.
that-- that was a mistake.
I know.
Hey, I'm just happy that through all of this
you can still think about boys.
so who is it?
somebody I know?
no, it's-- it's just somebody.
Really?
it doesn't seem like just somebody.
so, what color are these amazing eyes?
I think I'm gonna have to start looking in the hallways
to see if I can guess who it is.
don't.
couple of more slips like that text And I'll know all about him.
no more slips. Promise.
well, that's too bad.
I was looking forward to finding out more.
it's private right now.
okay?
poof. Deleted. All gone.
it's just everybody's entitled to privacy.
if you and dad can have secrets, why can't I?
okay.
God, I'm glad to see you.
you've got a cop car across from your house.
where? I didn't see it.
detectives.
trust me, I know every stock sedan in town.
they used to rotate in front of my house.
what's going on?
the police searched my house.
they took things from my room.
I'm a person of interest.
what do they think you did?
I think they think that ...
they think that I- - They think you hurt alison?
that's crazy.
well, it's good to hear somebody else say that.
you got any coffee made?
Yeah, always.
paper cups?
why paper cups?
you're going to take coffee
to those cops watching your house.
why am I going to do that?
so they'll know you know they're out there And you're not afraid of them.
Yeah, but I am kind of afraid.
they don't know that.
the car that you saw alison get in the night that she was killed -
I never saw the driver. I told you.
I think the driver was ian.
you tell the cops what you think?
Yeah, I told them.
and now I'm the little girl who cried ian.
they think you lied to them.
big deal. People lie to the cops all the time.
it's more than that.
it's a lot of things that add up to make me look really suspicious.
maybe you should keep away from me.
people cross the street when they see me coming,
and they think you're trying to frame your brother-in-law.
who else are we gonna hang out with?
Hey. -- Hey!
I, uh, I saw you talking to sean the other day.
Yeah. He's nice. - Nice.
he makes me laugh.
I know it might be kind of weird,
you being friends with hanna and hanna being his ex.
that's not really the weird part, is it?
Sean asked me about you.
he wanted to know if you were seeing anybody.
What'd you tell him?
I told him as far as I knew you weren't.
I think he wanted me to talk him up with you.
and I'm pretty sure he's gonna ask you out.
he has.
and what'd you say?
I said yes.
it's not really a date.
we're going with a bunch of other people.
no big.
Yeah.
you're nervous about this dinner.
Yeah, I guess I am.
well, the important thing is We'll get past all the sneaking around,
which, by the way, we were not that clever, Because aria knew.
what? When?
I don't know, but she did.
she ends up with all of our secrets.
and now she wants one of her own.
what do you mean?
some new romance.
I found out about it accidentally,
and I teased her, which apparently was the wrong thing to do.
who's the boy? - I don't know.
she wants to keep it a secret for now, which I completely understand.
is it somebody at school?
probably.
aren't you interested in who she's dating?
of course I am.
and when she's ready, she'll tell us.
what? What is that look?
it's the look of somebody who just had to pick up his daughter after she'd been questioned by the police.
and you had the same look.
she didn't do anything wrong.
I'm just saying we need to be a little bit more diligent about this.
Yes, but diligent doesn't mean grilling her
about every text she sends to a boy.
we have to trust her.
well, it's not aria I don't trust.
it's the rest of the world.
you know what I mean.
I think I do.
just hold onto this stuff for me, okay?
you didn't mention ezra's name in the text, did you?
no, no.
but what if I had?
I mean, if I had made one wrong detail in that text,
my mom would have figured it out And everything would have blown up-- forever.
fresh manicures and tiny keyboards -
a deadly combination.
our first coffee together.
the night that he read his short story.
okay, I'll give you a catalogue later.
just ...Put this stuff in your locker.
don't worry. - Thanks.
Hey, stop.
listen-- Look at this way-- we both made a mistake.
no, I can't do it tonight.
I know what I said, but it's different now.
first of all, I don't think she's who you say she is.
don't call her that.
no. I can't do it tonight.
because I say so.
because I'm living in her house and you keep calling -
it's gotta stop.
okay, fine.
later. Later.
you got it wrong.
we heard what we heard, hanna.
no, you heard what you heard, but you got it wrong.
he was talking to another girl, And there was a lot of history. You could tell.
what happened to being all happy for hanna?
Where'd all that go?
we want you to be happy -
then you shouldn't tell me this, because it's not true.
not after we ...
you just-- you heard wrong.
he could have been on the phone with his foster parents or something, Or his social worker.
you don't know.
okay, maybe we didn't hear it right.
Hanna, we heard what caleb said, And you have to know the truth.
I think he's with someone else and hasn't told you.
no, caleb has told me everything, And I told him everything.
not everything, but I told him all about me.
and what you're saying, it's not him.
it can't be.
okay, guys, maybe we are being a little bit paranoid.
you know, with all that's going on, We're looking at things too closely, We're getting these details, but can't see the big picture.
guys.
Caleb's not picking up.
she's gonna send him a text.
what the hell is going on?
either it's exactly what it looks like, Which is bad enough, or it's something worse.
couldn't it just be two pendants that look alike?
dream on.
if caleb hurts hanna, he's a dead man.
not literally.
I mean-- I gotta go.
impressive!
score for paige.
he asked me, and I thought it would be fun.
I thought he was gonna hibernate for the rest of the year,
but you dragged him out of the cave.
nice work.
passing her information?
what kind of information?
what was on the flash drive?
I couldn't see, but it could have been anything.
anything?
anything from hanna's computer, I guess.
Caleb the hacker.
is that who toby heard jenna talking to
when she wrote down the number?
wait. 2-1-4 has to do with caleb?
you know what you're saying, right?
that jenna plus calab equals "a.
No!
he can't be doing this.
whatever it is, it can't be this.
and it can't be her.
Hanna, no one wants this to be true.
has he called you back?
not yet.
and nobody's seen him in school since this morning.
you don't know what this would mean if it's true.
Hanna, we do know.
wait. Hanna-- Wait.
don't.
I'll be home call me please -hanna Money?
you did this for money?
she knew I was a hacker.
she asked me about her phone.
the phone you couldn't crack, was that a lie too?
Jenna found out that I did work on emily's phone.
she offered me cash to make myself available to you and listen.
I thought it was just some generic bitchiness with all the pretty girls.
why shouldn't I make a couple of bucks?
you are such a creep.
wait.
then she started asking questions, Questions that I didn't like.
and by then ...
other things were happening ...With you and me.
you were spying on me the whole time.
no, not the whole time.
you gave her your locker combination!
that's how she gave me the flash drive.
what was on it when she got it back?
junk.
she thinks it's the log off your cell phone, but it's not.
no- - Don't touch me.
I'm sorry.
Why? You didn't do anything.
I'm part of what happened to her-- What's happening to all of you.
it's the other way around, toby.
we happened to you.
what's it like to run away?
cold.
didn't you ever run away?
once.
I think I was seven.
my sister and I had an argument over something,
and my parents took melissa's side.
what were you fighting about?
some great injustice I can't remember now.
but they sided with her, So I made a tuna salad sandwich, and I ran away.
and where did you go?
the movies.
it was something animated.
there was a princess, and everybody was singing.
then I got lonely.
and I ate my tuna salad sandwich And I came home.
were your parents worried?
they hadn't even noticed I was gone.
do me a favor.
what?
if you ever get the urge to run away again ...
call me first, okay?
okay.
what are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
if she finds out you're spying on her, she'll be furious.
I'm not spying.
I'm just standing in our daughter's bedroom.
we agreed long ago that we weren't gonna be Those parents that poke and pry.
Yeah, but what about those parents who worry?
and what if something happened to her?
how would you feel?
that's not fair.
life isn't fair.
if she's keeping secrets, It's because she learned it from us.
meaning what?
meaning exactly what I said.
if there are parts of her life that she wants private,
it's because we taught her to do that.
you mean I did.
I don't want to talk about that.
Yeah, but it's still there, isn't it?
Yeah. It is.
I thought we were past that.
we're not past it.
we're trying to find a way around it, But we really haven't dealt with it.
okay, fine. Can we just keep this about aria and this unknown boy?
can we do that? - I don't know, can we?
is that really what this argument is all about?
I'm not arguing.
Byron, you can't even agree with me that we are fighting.
we're n-- Hey, mike.
did you just get home?
I called her. She didn't pick up.
did she talk to you?
radio silence.
poor hanna.
why do you think jenna told caleb to go after her?
because she was the one who wasn't seeing anybody.
target of convenience.
I should just pick a boy, someone nice,
and just tell my mom that that's who I was texting.
that'd be the simple solution.
there's nothing simple about lying.
I didn't mean it like that.
I meant lying in general.
okay. If you say so.
you've got a good shot at having the search warrant thrown out.
judge enwright is a notorious rubber stamp,
and he probably didn't even read it.
so ...Whatever they find, we can get tossed out.
why are they searching my room?
what makes me so special?
police thinking is like water.
it runs downhill and travels the path of least resistence.
so when they found out that you and ian were once involved,
you went to the top of their list.
I could never hurt alison.
she made me furious sometimes, but ...
but I would never hurt her.
honey, I know you didn't do what they think you did.
you couldn't.
we're gonna get this behind us, And then we're gonna figure out a way to move ahead
all of us, as a family.
come downstairs?
in a little while.
where were you all morning?
walking.
just walking.
so it's true?
Yeah. It's all true.
Where's spencer?
Oh, she stayed home.
come on.
I just want to talk to her.
Hello?
yes?
this is hanna.
in case you couldn't guess.
what i don't They were getting along, and I came home And find them fighting in your room.
about what?
about some boy they don't like.
dump him.
or just say you'll dump him.
it's not that simple.
lie to them, okay?
you used to do it all the time.
tell them what they want to know, Even if you have to make it up.
Hey, it's gonna be okay, all right?
we're gonna go downstairs, we're gonna have dinner,
we're gonna talk about mom coming back,
and everything's gonna go back to normal. Okay?
it better.
change of plans.
your mom has called.
she's, uh, not feeling well.
is she sick?
no, she's just not up to it tonight.
we'll do it another time.
soon.
come on.
everything smells so great I can't wait to see what you guys came up with.
are you busy -paige
you know, they were worried about you.
they thought you might have run away.
thank you for your concern.
I think I'd understand if you did, though.
you know, run away.
you know what I don't need, ian?
I don't need your understanding.
well, we're family.
we should act like one.
family protects itself.
I thought you had to protect melissa and your bundle of joy.
I do ...
and I will.
but right now there's still a window of protection left open for you.
we just need to be honest with each other.
you want to help me run away, don't you?
Oh, that would be great for you.
she ran away, she must be guilty.
if I disappeared, that would just clean up everything for you, wouldn't it?
time's running out for you, spencer.
you should take the help that's offered -
wherever it comes from.
because when they arrest you ...
it'll be too late.
nice room.
Thanks.
window seat.
I always wanted a room with one of those.
you had your date with sean?
Yeah.
that's where I was tonight.
how'd it go? - Great. Good.
he's a nice guy.
Yeah, it went okay.
good. - Yeah.
until he kissed me.
he took me home and kissed me goodnight.
and ...
I don't know, The date, the whole night, just felt ...
phony all of a sudden, like it wasn't me -
it was somebody I was watching, but not me.
he went home, and I texted you.
Sean's a nice guy, And if he's interested in you as more than a friend, You have to be honest with him.
you're saying I should dump him?
I'm saying you shouldn't lead him on, You have to be honest.
that is so easy for you to say.
you're fearless.
I am so not fearless.
you came out.
I didn't come out of the closet.
I fell out-- on my face.
but I'm out.
and whatever else happens, I don't have to worry about it anymore.
if I say it out loud ...
if I say ...
"I'm gay" ...
the whole world is gonna change.
Yeah. It will.
you want to hear something funny?
I would love to hear something funny.
when I was trying to talk myself into being interested in boys, I would look for guys like you.
like me how?
the kind that would pull me up on stage and get me to sing.
because I would never do that on my own.
yeah?
Caleb's things are gone from the guest room.
he left.
can I come in?
not right now, I'm gonna take a bath.
I'm sorry, honey. It's me.
did you just get home?
Yeah.
is everything okay?
I was right.
we've got a shot at having the search warrant thrown out.
that's good.
Yeah, that's good, But there was nothing for them to find.
they did find something.
what do you mean?
I got this back channel.
they found some fibers, Some threads caught in a bracelet -
that name bracelet of yours.
the one alison gave us?
the threads match the sweater That they found in toby's closet,
the one with the blood stains.
I have to ask you-- did you have that sweater?
did you plant it in toby's house?
No!
that's the sweater alison was wearing the night she died.
how could I have that sweater?
I guess the theory is that she gave it to you that night, Or you took it from her.
I took it from her?
you mean like after she died
inside their minds, it makes sense.
what about in your mind?
what do you think?
I think someone's going to a great deal of trouble to make you look guilty.
mom.
it's okay.
they served a search warrant - Make them get out.
I can't. You're person of interest in a murder investigation.
you're a cop now?
I was... Not expecting that.
me neither.
I had an amazing time last night, And I would really like to keep seeing you.
like this? Always in the middle of nowhere?
so who is it? Somebody new? Somebody I know?
I think I'm gonna have to start looking in the hallways to see if I can guess who it is.
you were spying on me, the whole time.
not the whole time.
don't touch me.
they found some fibers... Some threads caught in a bracelet.
the one alison gave us?
I think someone's going to a great deal of trouble To make you look guilty.
do you think somebody rubbed that sweater on your bracelet?
somebody? Try ian.
he's doing everything he can to make you look guilty.
your parents should hire you a 24-hour bodyguard.
what about jenna?
what if she paid caleb to get that bracelet?
when was caleb in spencer's house?
he doesn't need an invitation, em. He broke into a vending machine with a spork.
guys... I think somebody's watching us.
those? They're for the founders festival.
man, if that's what rosewood's founding family looked like,
how did they ever get anyone to move here?
and why were they allowed to reproduce?
guys, if caleb was - Could we stop using the "c" word?
we know this is hard for you, okay, But we have to talk about ca-- him.
if we want to help spencer, We have to know what caleb knows.
guys, there is definitely somebody out there.
maybe if emily and I cornered caleb-- Not in school, but somewhere that's jenna-free.
if caleb's gonna talk to anyone, it's gonna be me.
will you do it?
to help spencer, sure.
Thanks, hanna.
Spencer? Are you coming? - Yeah.
what's the purple one?
s sugar than soda. Folic acid.
Dr. Barone's new nurse chatted my ear off about it.
really just an excuse so she could ask questions about our family.
what kind of questions?
mom, everyone in town's talking about us.
the bracelet, The police marching out of here with bags.
what did you say, to this nurse? - Nothing.
but you know the second I left,
she probably told the others that spencer was gonna be Wearing handcuffs at my baby shower.
morning, sweetie. You want some yogurt?
I have-- I have fresh berries.
no. I already ate, thanks.
what were you talking about?
the founders festival.
your sister and ian are thinking of helping Mrs. Ackard with the church booth.
fun.
actually, I'd like you to join them.
you get on Mrs. Ackard's good side, And no one in town would...
why do I need to be on her good side?
because people are talking And jumping to a lot of conclusions.
it's toby.
honey, I'd prefer it if you'd not have any contact with him Until this situation is behind us.
Why? What does toby have to do with anything? He's a friend.
you need to be careful about who you associate with.
so, what? I'm just supposed to ignore him, not speak to him?
Yes. Sweetie, listen to me.
you need to be at the festival.
if you're not, your neighbors are gonna think You have something to hide.
I don't really care what my neighbors think.
they're not just neighbors, spencer, They're potential jurors.
and most verdicts are decided in living rooms, And town fairs.
just take toby out of that equation, okay?
good morning.
so... I have a meeting tonight,
but do you want to wait so we can have dinner together and...?
I'll grab something after school.
okay.
did... Caleb move back in with his foster family?
do you want to tell me why he moved out so quickly?
there's... Nothing to tell.
look, if you would rather stay home from school, Have a mental health day...
knock-knock.
in here, mona.
morning, mrs. M. - Hi.
can I steal some of that coffee? - Sure.
is sketchy-boy gone for good?
Yes, mona, he's gone.
you ready? - Hanna, could I just say something?
this is all my fault. - What?
I knew he was gonna disappoint you in a major way,
and I blame myself for not stepping up to protect you.
Mona. - No, I mean it.
a big part of me never trusted him, And if I'd been a better friend,
I would have told him to get lost Before he unzipped his ready duffle bag.
I hate seeing you get hurt. - Well, I'm not hurt.
can we go?
got a second?
um... Sure.
look, I don't know what hanna's told you... - Everything.
she's my best friend. - Then maybe you can help me.
she's having a hard time hearing how sorry I am.
she won't take my calls, She looks the other way whenever I see her. - Caleb.
have this conversation with hanna, okay?
what are you doing?
I got 'em. I got the tickets.
no way!
I thought they were sold out.
my dad knows somebody at hollis who works for college events.
that's awesome. How much was it?
my treat. Isn't that why they call it a date?
those tickets were expensive.
em, I can handle two tickets.
Troy sattler will pay for his own.
wait. Troy sattler's coming too?
Emily, you know I want to be alone with you,
but I got the tickets from my dad, And I just thought if a guy came along...
I'm not pretending to date troy.
he's just, like, insurance.
look, I really want to have that talk with my dad. I do.
I even went online and looked for, like, what to say.
you're gonna come out to your parents through e-mail?
no.
Sheridan prep has a campus pride group, With a website.
it's not like I can go to a meeting, though. Their school is, like, two miles from here.
then meet someone from the group for a coffee.
would it help if I went with you?
Hey. - Hi.
so, can we talk about this weekend, the festival?
I was think-- - Oh, god! I am so sorry. Did I do that?
um... Sorry.
look, how do you feel about a stay-at-home weekend instead, Your place, with me?
Yeah. What's going on?
Oh, did I get it on your shoes? I am such a spaz!
look, we can just talk about it later.
sure. My classroom, after school.
no, we can't. Can we just do this over dinner?
sure.
mind if I join you? - Uh... No. I mean, yes, please.
so, we're talking?
what does jenna want?
why was she willing to pay you to live in my basement?
I told you, I gave the money back.
what did she ask you to do? Record our conversations?
rifle through my purse, The drawers in my bedroom?
what does she want?
a key.
she offered me a lot of money to look for a key.
a key to what, my house?
I gave you that.
no. She thinks that your friend, the one who died, may have give you or one of your girls a key.
ali didn't die, she was murdered.
what kind of key? - Jenna didn't know.
and as soon as I realized something was happening between you and me,
I told her to back off.
Hanna, what's with you guys and jenna cavanaugh?
why did she need me?
why couldn't she just ask you directly?
you know what? You don't get to ask questions.
what else?
if I knew more, so would you.
I miss you.
Yeah. You'll get over it.
okay, I'm back. - Hey, is fitz there?
no, he got pulled into some faculty thing,
so he texted me to order some food.
so you guys are still texting?
Wow. I would have thought after that thing with your mom...
he doesn't know about that.
if he thinks my parents are sniffing us out, It'll just make him paranoid, not romantic.
Yeah, tell me about it.
I still don't know if toby thinks I set him up with that sweater.
wait, you haven't talked to him yet?
no.
he left me a message Saying that he couldn't meet me after school.
I gotta go. My mom's calling. - Okay. Bye.
Hello? - Hey, it's me.
uh, yeah, this meeting's Running a bit long.
did you order dinner yet?
um... You know what? I-I can't stay.
is something wrong?
no, no. Um, we'll just-- we'll talk later, okay?
okay.
that's what I said.
was it a key to ali's house? Her locker at the tennis club?
why would jenna want that? What was she gonna do, sniff ali's old sweat socks?
if jenna's "a," she's looking for Any information on us she can get.
I cannot believe that he went through my closet and my nightstand. What a jerk!
he's a total creep. - He's an animal.
easy, guys.
he looked through your stuff, he didn't invade poland.
why are you sticking up for him? He broke her trust.
he went behind her back.
he stuck his hands in her panty drawer!
I'm sorry.
okay, all I'm saying is that somebody can look through someone else's stuff that they're not supposed to be looking through.
you wanna translate that into speech?
I saw ezra's website page.
look, I-I knocked his desk, and his laptop screen came up.
so, big deal.
what's the juiciest thing on his status update?
Ezra fits has joined the mark twain fan page"?
how 'bout he has a double life.
wait, I thought that you were his double life.
fine. Triple life.
there was this picture of him cozying up to some girl wearing an engagement ring in Italy.
what's her name? - Jackie.
how do you know she wasn't his cousin?
cause in picture number three, They were licking each other's gelato.
I mean, guys, seriously, what do I do?
be honest with him.
explain what happened and see what he says.
Yeah, and remember, people can look guilty of something even if they're completely innocent.
okay, you know what? Screw that.
make a fake profile,"friend" jackie, comb through that skank's page, and nail his ass to the wall.
or we can do what emily says.
Hey. How are you? - Relieved...That you're speaking to me.
I wasn't sure if you'd heard the cops' theory About me planting evidence.
we shouldn't talk about this.
so you do think it was me?
no, of course not.
but I can't say the same for my family.
Spencer, you should go home.
those guys have a way of adding two and two And coming up with five.
I'll stop by your place later.
um, I'm not sure that that's such a good idea.
why not?
because your parents don't want you near me?
makes sense.
how 'bout the festival?
maybe we could meet up behind a tent, Or the funhouse.
seven o'clock?
Toby. I need you to drive me to school. I have a make-up test.
okay, just... Let me get cleaned up.
Hey, spencer.
uh... How's it goin'? - You tell me, garrett.
I thought you were on our side.
I don't get to have personal feelings When I'm in uniform.
well, if you put on a pair of jeans, This would be called stalking.
Spencer, look. If being trailed is gonna help clear your name, better it's me than someone who thinks you're guilty.
Hey, are you paige?
what? Oh, no. I'm emily, her friend.
are you...? - Samara.
I go to sheridan prep. Member of the campus pride group.
did your friend tell you?
Yeah. Sorry. Didn't realize you'd be so...Punctual.
okay, so even though we can't see her profile, Jackie and mr. Fitz - Ezra.
went to the same college.
so I looked up alumni and punched in random names until I found a girl who already didn't have a page.
Tonya freeman? - Yep.
who's that? - Who cares?
this is starting to feel so wrong.
Hey, it's so not.
look, I don't want what happened to me to happen to you.
fool me once, shame on you, and fool my best friend, you're dead-frickin'-meat.
hm, that's... Tender.
but what about a profile picture?
Oh, we're not putting one up.
okay, if the profile is faceless, Jackie will assume it was someone she used to be friends with, feel guilty she forgot they exist, And accept the friend request.
well, jackie is about to be reunited With one of her old pals.
you do the honors, tonya.
Aria, do you want to know the truth or not?
Emily, not to be rude, but...Is there a friend? - What?
look, if you made it this far, you're doing great.
Oh, no, no. It's not me.
this is about paige, Someone I'm starting to date.
that's why this sucks. Feels like it's a step back for me.
I get it.
I was with a closeted girl when I first moved here. Nothing but drama.
I start to realize that if it was meant to be, it shouldn't be this hard.
something tells me she's not coming. - I'm sorry.
it's okay. I had to be in the neighborhood anyway.
I'm setting up a booth at the festival.
me and some friends from art class are selling handmade jewelry.
that's cute. Did you make that?
Yeah. Thanks.
Hey, if you want to see more, you should come by early, Get the first choice.
are you free tomorrow morning?
Aw, cute.
did you come up with that yourself, mrs. Ackard?
well, if you want people to cough up money, You'd better make 'em smile.
okay, we're good.
that tent's not coming down anytime soon.
Oh, we feel safe in your hands, ian.
shame on you two for not having a church wedding in rosewood.
well, we plan on making up for it.
our baby's gonna have the biggest christening this town's ever seen.
Oh, good! We need as many joyous events as possible.
this town still hasn't recovered since alison's...
Oh. Me and my loose lips. I'm sorry.
no, it's okay, mrs. Ackard.
under the circumstances, Spencer's doing really well.
Ian, before I forget, the reverend and I are planning a golf trip,
but we can't decide between pebble beach, Kaanapali, hilton head...
Ooh! Ian knows all about hilton head.
Oh, have you been there?
Yeah. Um... I only played there once, but it was a dream.
and did you stay there too?
Yeah, um... and make sure you get a room overlooking the ninth hole, right, hon?
definitely. The room's got an amazing ocean view.
Oh, really?
the brochure says that the golf course and the ocean are on opposite sides of the hotel.
Oh, no, that's right. Um, I was thinking about the view from the hotel restaurant.
what do you think you're doing?
Oh, ian, could you help me with this box out to the booth, please?
Ah, yes, ma'am. Of course.
so, did you tell the police that you stayed on opposite sides of the hotel, or were you even at hilton head?
did you make these?
not to toot my own horn, but...Toot-toot!
they look... Amazing with your skin tone.
you should have them.
you don't have to give them to me.
okay, steal them. I'll turn around.
Hi. - Hi.
uh, paige, this is samara from sheridan prep, who you were supposed to meet at the grille.
Oh. Hi. - Hi.
look, if you ever want to reschedule, Grab a coffee, talk about your dad, emily has my cell.
um... Tell your friend how hot she looks in those earrings.
Oh, hey, mrs. Marin. - Hanna's not here.
she's, um... Setting up for the festival.
what's in the bag? - Screwdriver.
I accidentally packed it.
I didn't want you to think I made off with your stuff.
so where are you staying?
well, for the next few nights, on a bus, On my way to arizona.
does hanna know you're leaving?
I don't expect her or you To throw me a going-away party.
all I know is my daughter's sitting in a dark room Listening to elliott smith on a loop.
I don't know what happened between you two. - Would it matter?
you were never really my biggest fan.
that's because I didn't want to see my daughter Listening to elliott smith on a loop.
I'm not judging. I think she's lucky.
maybe if I had a mom like you, I wouldn't be sleeping on a bus and making up the rules as I go along.
can you give this to her?
you should go to the festival and give it to her yourself.
Hanna doesn't need one more guy in her life Leaving without saying goodbye.
what did you tell her... About me? - Nothing.
I told her you were dealing with stuff, - You were scared your parents would... - I wish you hadn't done that.
if I didn't show up, there was a reason.
Hey. The second you guys left, everybody suddenly got thirsty.
uh, here, for the earrings.
look, paige, I hope it didn't seem like I was calling you out.
I get it. We've all been there.
I know you're trying to be nice and everything, but, honestly, you don't even know me.
Paige! - What?
sorry, emily, I'm not looking to join a club and ride down main street on a rainbow chopper.
actually, I drive a jeep.
but that's beside the point.
you know what? I'm gonna take this to go. I've got a paper that's due.
tell your friends it was really nice to meet them.
Emily, wait. - What?
so you can be rude to me too?
you know what, paige? This is becoming way too much drama.
I don't want to be your secret.
Mona. Thought you were gonna help.
I am helping.
I'm making sure you don't Host a pity party for yourself and invite a cheesecake.
um, don't look now, but sketchy is at 12: 00.
I-I cannot deal with him right now. Just don't tell him I'm here.
we're not open for business yet. - I know.
Hanna's mom said that - She had to step out.
any idea when she'll be back?
probably when you leave.
you really hurt her, caleb.
make sure she gets this.
what did he want? - Change for a twenty.
can you help me with the tape?
I LOVE YOU HANNA - Hey. We've been looking for you. - Why?
did the reverend's wife start to see through your act too?
when are you gonna learn to just keep quiet? - Get away from me.
you know, every time you try to bring me down, you end up in trouble.
and you know what they say about quicksand, spence.
the more you struggle, the faster you sink.
and you're sinking fast.
So...Runaway bride, top-secret affair, all five seasons of big love.
I sense a theme here.
you trying to tell me something?
Yeah. I guess I am.
but after I do, You have to tell me something.
okay.
Friday...When-- when I got here before you,
I... I saw a photo on your website page of you... And jackie.
I wasn't looking for it, okay?
I was hunting down your menus and the photo popped up, And...
I couldn't help but notice How happy the two of you were.
and, oh, did I mention a ring? Because she was wearing a ring.
look, ezra, I am not coming From some freaky, jealous place, okay?
I mean, maybe I was when I picked out big love, but, honestly...
I-I just feel like you know everything about me, and I don't feel like you've shared as much.
please jump in at any time.
I... Uh... I met jackie my freshman year in the dorm.
we saw each other on and off for about two years.
good. I need more.
she was the first really serious girlfriend I ever had.
I dated other people, but none of them were her.
so, when we got back together, I... I proposed.
that picture was taken in florence.
I bought the ring on the ponte vecchio.
my brother had to wire me the money.
I didn't even tell him what it was for.
Why?
cause I wasn't sure what her answer would be.
so... You were married?
no. No, it never happened.
Oh. Why did you break it off?
I didn't. She did.
Oh. Fitz, why hasn't she taken down that photo?
Oh, I don't know.
guess it was a great summer with lots of memories she wants to hold on to.
and what about you?
Aria, that's her photo, not mine.
but if she hadn't given you back that ring, you'd be married to her right now.
possibly.
and you've never told me this because...
I guess I'm one of those people that doesn't put things that didn't work out on my r
what's... what's bothering you more-- That old photo being out there, or... The fact that you and I can't take a picture like that?
Aria. That was then. You're very much now.
Hey, sweetie, how's it going? - Good.
did caleb come by? - Nope. Haven't seen him.
he came by the house. I think he wanted to say goodbye.
he's leaving rosewood.
he is? - Yeah.
well... Good riddance.
look, you called it, mom. Some bad boys are just that. Bad.
the thing is, I was wrong.
but if it makes a difference, My first impression of him was way off.
what are you seeing now that you didn't see before?
myself.
can u call me?
poor Em, You definitely have a type: Love me, lie for me.
I brought you a present back from my trip,
but you have to keep it a secret.
I didn't bring anything back for the other girls,
so if they ask about it, you have to lie.
promise?
it's beautiful. It's vintage. My grandma gave it to me.
I wanted you to have it.
you're the only one that really understands me, em,
the only one that I can completely be honest with.
I have to go. I have a prior engagement.
we'll definitely see you later, right? - Yeah.
don't have any fun without me.
make sure you keep that in a safe place.
it's a lot more valuable than it looks.
Raymond PLUS STORAGE
what happened?
here, put that over your head.
are you gonna torture me 'cause I gave somebody else a ring?
Aria, seriously, it wasn't even a karat.
get in the bag, mr. Fitz. We're taking a picture as a couple.
you know this is nuts, right?
are we done? I can't breathe.
time out.
I think I found the key. Call me now.
I have to leave.- N-now?
are you coming back?
um... I-I don't know. I might. I'll call you. Love you.
you too.
Hey, em, it's me. I'm on my way.

Hey, guys, wait for me!
having ANY FUN YET?
shut UP OR I'LL SHUT YOU UP -A
Toby, where are you?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
can somebody please help me?
Hey, can somebody hear me?
why didn't you answer your phone?
I left it at the booth.
you didn't get emily's text?
she found the key, the key that jenna was looking for.
she wants us to meet her at that storage place near hollis.
Where's spencer?
I couldn't reach her. Hopefully, she's on the way.
somebody please open this!
Hello?!
please open the door!
Hello? Please?
Mr. Fitz. I'm sorry to disturb you.
I'm garrett reynolds with the rosewood police. You got a minute?
sure. What can I do for you?
may I come in? - Yes, please.
excuse the mess.
what is this regarding?
I'd like to talk to you about one of your students.
Hello, please!
why isn't she answering?
I have no idea.
is he going somewhere?
I don't know.
Arizona. Who cares?
go over there and say something. Go... Before he does.
I can't.
now, come on. Emily's waiting for us.
sir. - Oh, thank you.
Toby, is that you?
Ian? Yeah, I've got her! She's fine.
Oh, honey, are you okay?
you needed a crowbar to get her out?
it's what was keeping her in.
somebody jammed the door with it.
I'm here. Where can I find you?
nobody else comes in here until you figure this out.
my sister-in-law could have been seriously hurt.
come on, girls, let's cut through here.
guys, look.
what is that?
that's ali's old lunchbox from when she was a kid.
what is that?
I don't know, but we're taking it. - Hanna, wait.
wait for what? For someone else to take it?
someone's been spying on us for years.
and ali didn't take the video. She's in it.
she's in a lot of 'em.
Oh, my god, that's July 4th.
she always said it was toby peeping on us.
no, there's no way that this is toby.
well, then, who is it?
how 'bout why?
why did alison have these videos?
did the person who took this know she had them?
is this why she was killed?
he promised me a full schoolership he said I couldn't get it for I'll moved...
if I'll end up in different school, with a different program.
this family isn't doing anything, based on one conversation with one scout.
we need some kind of a commitment from the university.
look, I know I made a bloody mess of it, and I'm sorry for putting you in the middle of it, but perhaps my real mistake was falling for the wrong sister.
Hi, I'm Jackie molina.
is this the Montgomery house?
excuse me.
if she hadn't given you back that ring, you'd be married to her right now.
possibly.
it's him. - Ian's alive.
are you sure it was him?
if anybody finds out about the Jason thing...
you won't let that happen.
it's Jason.
what's he doing back in that house?
we just got off the phone with your therapist.
are you telling me that I can't see my friends?
did he say he killed her? - That's what he meant.
that's what he meant. That's what you think.
did Ian say "I killed Alison"? - Not those words.
not those words? - No.
did you get outside today? - Not in this weather.
she lied to you about being out?
who would she wanna show this to?
I can only think of one person who would care.
Seriously?
you think Jason's hiding him in that house? Why would he?
Ian killed his sister. That doesn't makes sense.
look, I didn't say I was positive.
I'm just telling you guys Melissa is sneaking out to meet Ian...On foot.
okay, your sister needs one of those dog collars.
the ones that zap your ass whenever you leave the property.
Hanna... - it's not just that.
her phone rings, and she has to leave the room to answer it.
what's up with that? - I still don't buy Jason would help him.
didn't he call Ian a "phony jerk"? - Yeah, when did that change?
it's Jason, you guys. Who knows what to believe?
he was wasted the whole summer Ali disappeared.
he'd probably take that guy in for a six-pack.
but I thought Jason told you he was clean and sober now.
Emily, I've had, like, three conversations with him.
I never asked him for a urine sample. - Okay, gagging now.
so how are we supposed to keep 247 tabs on Melissa when we're not even allowed inside your house?
you guys...
what did you see?
Hanna, let's go! - No, I can't find my other shoe!
Ian, is that you?
what's going on? What are you doing?
looking for my ring. Would you mind getting up?
what ring? - My wedding ring.
why would you take it off?
it was cutting off my circulation. One of the perks of pregnancy.
none of your shoes fit and your fingers turn into sausages.
do you want me to get that?
your phone is buzzing. Do you want me to get it?
keep looking, would you?
Hey, I'm not alone. Let me get upstairs, okay?
morning. - Hi.
what's going on?
your father has a meeting on this side of town.
and I thought I'd drop by and give you a lift to school.
Oh, well, Mona usually picks me up.
Yeah, that's what I hear.
next time I'll call ahead.
maybe Monday or another day next week.
so you're staying in rosewood? - For a while.
I can get some business done at the hotel.
and I wanna be here for you.
Tom, you want some coffee to go?
no, no, I'm good, thanks.
okay, then...Uh, have a great day at school.
Bye.
so what was so funny? - What?
when I came downstairs, you guys were laughing.
Oh, that.
your dad reminded me dinner for his mother.
de while I cooking, your grandmother re-arranged the living room furniture.
I came out my own house.
cognize she is a piece of work.
well, that's Isabelle's problem now, right?
I'm just saying, if he's marrying her, why are you so jolly hazelnut creamer for his coffee?
because dairy makes him sick.
Hanna, your father and I have a long history, and believe it or not, we used to laugh...
a lot.
hmm, I must've missed that part.
Hanna... - I'm sorry.
I just think it's weird team tom.
I'm not.
I'm fully aware and what he's done, is but he has his moments.
look, just because somebody hurt us once doesn't mean we have from our phone book.
them things change. People grow.
whoo, we gotta find a better place to do this.
somewhere preferably with a fan.
good luck. A tunnel under the school.
uh, yeah, not with those hands. You need some serious moisturizer.
this letter isn't that bad, emily. - It's bad.
won't your mom be impressed scout even took the time here, to write?
use this. It cost more than my purse.
guys, it's a "maybe" letter.
my mom needs to see something real, something that says "let her stay in rosewood. We want her.
don't take her to Texas.
em, there are other colleges.
Yeah, other scouts will want you. - When?
my mom's already packed up the whole kitchen.
she keeps telling me the rodeo.
let's just do this later, okay?
um, what about after school?
I can't today. I've got field hockey.
I have swim practice.
I'm starting my class at Hollis.
is Jackie gonna be teaching it?
no, no, this is not about stalking.
if ezra says it's over between them, I believe him.
so, what, you're just gonna hang around campus with binoculars?
I'm following our therapist's orders on having separate time, okay?
it's an extension course. If I happen to bump into ezra, that's just a bonus.
Oh, nice bonus. - Yeah, great.
everyone's got a life except for me.
I thought you were gonna go to the mall with Mona.
stealing moisturizer is not a life. It's a hobby.
it's getting really boring.
you stole this? - No. It's a sample.
hey there. I thought you were done with this place.
I am. Just dropping off paperwork for the g. E.D.
I still have five minutes before the bell. You wanna grab some coffee?
I can't. I'm starting a new job, supposed to be there by nine.
Really? That's great where?
can I walk you to class? - Sure.
it is a carpentry job, right?
well, that's awesome. Who's it for?
Yeah, I kinda thought you'd be surprised.
I was, too, but he needs help building a fence around his
Toby, you can't work for him.
I need cash to buy tools and a truck. - A truck?
there's a cabinet maker in yardley who wants to hire me, but he said I need my own wheels.
still, you shouldn't go anywhere near that house.
Spencer, I need to get out of own house, and breaking out of there is gonna take major bucks even a used getaway car is more than I've got saved up.
and the seller's already got another offer.
just promise me that you won't go inside Jason's house.
Why? - Because I don't... totally trust him.
please, promise me.
promise.
Hey, lucas. What's the rush? - Oh, hi.
sit. - I can't.
I promised I'd give Caleb a ride to the hardware store during lunch.
you and Caleb are tight now?
He's...Living at my house.
my parents are letting him crash until he figures things out.
so is he staying here for a while or is he going back to Arizona?
you should probably ask him that yourself.
I'll see you. -No, wait. What about after school?
you wanna do something fun?
or something not fun, like studying?
I've got yearbook. We're going to the printer on Monday.
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
so how come I don't see you hanging around with your posse anymore?
Oh, you know, just busy.
figured we could use some separate time.
okay, was that your parents' idea or was that yours?
guess.
okay, we could probably use some help on layout.
why don't you meet me after last period?
Yeah.
if I say I lost it, they'll let me re-take the picture, right?
wait, why re-take it? It's perfect.
you look very...Studious.
it looks like a mug shot.
Yeah, like a very studious young lady from a prison laundry.
that is what you're going for, right? - Hey.
actually, when I was taking this, I was thinking about being released from prison.
you remember that prison called "high school," right?
Ah, yes, I do.
do you miss it?
not it as much as you.
can I just say how nice this is, reaching for your hand and not worrying about who might be watching us?
uh, aria, your dad does teach here three days a week.
Yeah, I know, but friday's not one of them.
Bye.
Oh, hey there. Just grab a smock. There's a couple spots in back.
good-bye.
just go ahead. Take a seat.
looking for someone.
uh, no. I'm...
I just thought maybe Toby was
he left...About an hour ago.
something wrong?
no, I thought you were inside.
why is that?
because I thought that you were the only one living here.
I am.
I'll let Toby know you stopped by.
there's no way Jason could close those curtains.
maybe it was the wind.
Emily, the window was closed! There was somebody in that upstairs room!
okay, I'm just saying, you could've imagined it.
sometimes when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
why are you talking to me like Ben Franklin?
there's a murderer living next door, my parents are in New York, and all I have to defend myself is a hockey stick!
well, ask Toby. If he's working there, maybe he could
no, I don't want Toby to get hurt.
if I tell him, he's gonna barge in there and try to act like a hero.
you're right. Don't tell Toby.
I gotta go.
is there any way that you can sleep over here tonight?
Yeah, that's never gonna happen. Lock your door.
you think your neighbors will call the cops?
everyone's used to it.
that place turns into party central whenever Ali's parents go out of town.
do you want anything else? - I'm good.
Ali? What's going on?
can I crash here tonight?
there's no friggin' way I'm sleeping there.
there's not enough locks on my bedroom door.
are Jason's friends hassling you?
Jason doesn't have friends.
he has idiots who use him to get wasted and act like animal planet.
were you the only girl?
of course.
what I should do is call my grandma.
what are you talking about?
he's been counting on the money.
all I have to do is say one word about him and his loser friends, and she'll write him out of her will so fast...
God, he makes me sick.
can I get a soda? - Sure.
ali, you're welcome to stay here.
Thanks.
are you okay?
Yeah, I was just...
thinking about my grandma.
your family has the worst apples.
Emily, have you tackled your closet yet?
uh, I'm still sorting.
just figuring out what I want to give away.
honey, we're not moving to the moon. Just put that stuff in storage.
would you answer the phone?
it's Paige. I'll call her back.
okay, you can take that call, but just come downstairs when you're done, all right?
Hello?
do you remember the night that Ali came over and crashed our sleepover?
I think something really ugly was going down between her and Jason.
okay, spencer, you've gotta stop playiharriet the spy, otherwise you're gonna lose your mind.
no, what if Ian was over there that night?
what if she was blackmailing both of them?
Spencer... - Where was Jason the night Ali was killed?
Hey, how many photos can I fit on this page?
Lucas? - Uh, four.
four Max.
who's that?
who? Her?
uh, she's doing the appendix.
does the appendix have a name?
Danielle. Danielle something.
well, does she know you're crushing on her?
she just joined, like, a week ago. We've barely said more than two words to each other.
well, if the two words were "you're cute
stop. stop. She's not interested.
she doesn't even know that I'm in the room.
of course she knows who you are, lucas.
you're the whole photo department.
can we not have this conversation?
well, she seems sweet.
so what's stopping you from asking her out?
knowing where I sit on the totem pole in this high school.
according to your pal Mona, I'm right below the kid who blows his nose on notebook paper.
well, we're not in 7th grade anymore. So if you like her, go for it.
okay, we got too many pictures of the marching band. Toss that.
seriously, just make a move.
you, of all people, know my batting average, hanna.
here.
put that with the drama club.
Hey. - Hey.
still can't find it?
you should call mom or dad.
maybe one of them found it and they put it somewhere so it'd be safe.
they didn't. I already spoke to mom.
maybe you should sleep in here tonight, instead of the barn.
maybe.
it's just that I don't like being by myself, and I don't sleep well when I'm alone.
Melissa? You get why I'm scared, right?
somebody broke in here last week, and I know about stuff that I wish that I didn't.
what are you trying to say?
I guess I'm just hoping that if it came down to it, that you would protect me...
over someone who's not me.
do remember kendra santoni, that bully that made me her punching bag in elementary school?
remember the day that I came home with that red mark on my neck and I was afraid to tell mom that kendra smacked me with a jump-rope?
then the next day on the playground, you cornered her and you said that if she ever touched me again, you'd make her eat that jump-rope.
I knew that you had my back.
remember?
you don't remember pushing her up against a wall?
no, I don't, and honestly, I'm kind of dealing with major stuff right now.
my husband has been missing for nearly a week.
I'm not looking to stroll down memory Lane.
don't make me choose between you and my husband, Spencer.
did she know that I was taking that class?
she was there first.
why can't I just escape high school?
probably 'cause you're still in it.
not helping.
Aria, maybe the universe is telling you something.
maybe you're in the class with Jenna so you guys can move on.
you're both talented artists.
you probably have a lot more in common than you think.
I just don't believe that Jenna's a very forgiving kind of person.
maybe I'll just take a painting class.
look, do what you want.
I'm just saying, you can run, but you can't hide.
if you're able to make things right with Jenna, why not do it?
Spencer, don't touch that coconut water! It's mine!
no, no, no, I know that...
that's not why I came here okay?
that has nothing to do with it.
I'll call you back. I'll call you back.
morning, sleepy.
your mom asked if I'd come look at the water heater.
where is she?
your mom? She's gone to the store to grab some things.
look, hanna, I'm don't know how much of that you overheard
so was that mom on the phone? - No. Isabelle.
we have some different ideas about the, uh, scale of this wedding.
if she had her way, we'd be renting out veterans' stadium.
dad, you don't have to share this.
it's just things are a little tense right now...
between me and Isabelle.
does mom know that?
your mom catches on pretty fast.
usually faster than I do.
you gotta stay out of it. - No, but if he ends up huring her
Hanna, I tried protecting my mom...
and it completely blew up in my face.
you just gotta let them work it out for themselves.
what is that?
read it.
if you continue as rosewood's m. V.P.
and anchor until the end of swim season, we can offer you a full schol
no way!
em, the scout changed his mind? This is amazing!
that means you don't have to move! - Wait, let me see this.
so what'd your mom say? - She hasn't seen it.
Why? - 'Cause I haven't mailed it yet.
what?
wait, did you write this letter?
Oh, my God!
you are a total rock star, Emily fields! You are totally getting me into Harvard!
Emily, I would not mail this. - Oh, I love it.
here, let me see if I have an extra stamp.
this just feels really wrong.
Oh, really? And taking an art class with Jenna isn't?
I hope your first assignment is how to make a weapon.
okay, I never said that I was actually staying in the class.
whatever. I'm still working that out.
okay, once your parents read this
Oh, big deal. She changed a few words.
it's like Alison used to say, "you're not lying. You're just pre-telling the truth.
Hey, does it matter if it looks a little used?
there's got to be another way.
there isn't.
wanna take a break? - Nah.
dude, you've been working non-stop. It doesn't have to be built in a day.
you got another job to go to or what? - No.
I'm guessing people around here are still giving you a hard time, huh?
just for the record, toby, I never believed you were guilty of anything...
except maybe being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I've been there.
who's that? Melissa?
uh, no.
Hi. It's Spencer. - Hi.
why would you think that I was Melissa?
has she been coming over a lot? - Uh, a couple times.
mailman keeps giving you guys my stuff.
I'm gonna grab a drink. You want something, toby?
I'm okay.
you? - No, thanks.
what's wrong? - Is there any way I can convince you to quit right now for good?
Spencer, I just started, and he gave me a huge cash advance.
enough to buy your truck?
I'm sure that truck's already sold.
well, did you call?
Spencer, that job in yardley's going to someone else. They're not gonna wait for me.
Yeah, but there'll be others.
maybe, but right now, this is all I've got.
I'd invite you guys inside, but the place is kinda crazy.
cut myself.
I'm sorry, what is your name?
me?
do you mind giving Jenna a little help, please?
I can do it.
Oh, thanks, bryce.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
so I have a question...
how many times has the choir been listed in the appendix?
um, they're listed by individual names.
do you think I missed someone? - I'll have to check.
Lucas took so many great pictures.
it sucks that we can't use all of them.
but I'm sure he'll just frame the rest and sell 'em on ebay.
why would anybody buy a picture of a choir that they're not in?
could be a collector's item someday.
Lucas has already sold a lot of his work.
who's Lucas?
my friend over there.
it's weird calling him my friend.
I mean, that's what he is, even if I wanted it to be more at one point.
I didn't just have the energy to compete.
compete with who? - With every other girl in the 11th grade.
he's got that quiet nerd thing going on, but it's just a cover.
he totally has a wild side.
it's a real diamond.
I'll be back for it on Monday.
as soon as the banks open, I'll have the cash.
so you said.
is anyone gonna be missing this ring over the weekend?
what? No, of course not.
I don't want no trouble.
like I said, it's mine.
I just need some cash till Monday.
all right.
thank you. - See you Monday.
you meant this Monday, right? Like in two days?
Yeah, yeah.
Hanna, wait!
I thought we were done.
what did you say to Danielle? - Why?
she came over to me as we were packing up and asked to see more of my photos.
you told her I sold my pictures online?
Yeah, so? You've sold other things.
okay, maybe it was a mistake, but at least now she knows your name.
she wants to grab coffee with me sometime next week.
Ooh, congrats.
why did you speak to her?
because I'm your friend, Lucas.
it was painful watching you drool. - No, I mean, what's behind it?
last time you were this nice to me,
I was just a body-shield to help you break up with Sean.
Lucas, can't you trust that I was just doing you a solid because I care about you?
look, I apologized for what happened that night with Sean.
it was a mistake, but I don't want to be judged for the rest of my life by my biggest mistake.
people change, okay?
they grow.
well, then...Thank you.
I found this in the attic.
you want me to give that stuff away?
Oh, god, no, honey.
I wouldn't even trust this with the movers.
I think you and I will just take care of this box, okay?
mom, are you okay? - Yeah.
what's going on? - Nothing. I'm just...
Emily, it must've been so hard for you to hide who you are, to think that if you told me the truth,
I wouldn't still love you no matter what.
mom, I don't feel that way anymore.
I know you don't.
but it wasn't easy getting here, right?
okay, I've got a lot of packing to do.
why don't you go ahead and finish up your studying, and then we'll just go out to dinner.
okay. - All right.
take it. It's yours.
are you crazy?
do you know how long it'll take me to pay you back?
well, you have a job to get to tomorrow.
in yardley, right?
I love you so much.
I wanted to say that first.
so sorry. T.I take it all back. I'd marry you in a phone booth. Call me. I love you. XO Isabel
Erass Message? YES NO
Anita? Could you do me a favor?
would you mind putting this on the turntable against the wall?
sure.
and if you wouldn't mind cleaning everything else off, that would be perfect.
I finally get a chance to see how it turned out.
I mean, I can't really see anything.
maybe just some shadows.
light it for me, would you?
please. I would love to know if it looked like what I saw in my head.
and can you turn the lights off, too?
what do you see?
I used to swim a lot.
there was this lake that we would go to.
it wasn't very deep, but I loved to glide along the bottom, then turn around and look up.
the sunlight on the surface would break into a million pieces...
like beads.
and as you got closer, the light would bounce and it would dance and that's sort of what I was going for, but I...
I can't see...
anything.
it's beautiful.
it's kinda like what you said, like being underwater.
the light's soft and it's- - Aria?
is that Aria?
please answer me.
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.
blow out the candle.
Jenna- - blow it out!
no, not here. Stay down the road.
I wanna make sure she's asleep.
perfect. I'll see you then.
Emily, I found this on the doormat.
it must've been delivered when we were out at dinner.
what is it? - It's a letter from danby university.
it's addressed to you.
don't you want to open it?
well, do you mind if I open it?
okay.
Oh, honey...You did it.
they want you on their team.
Mr. rabin says if "you continue as rosewood's m. V.P. And anchor "until the end of swim season, we can offer you a full scholarship for freshman year.
look at this! Read it!
honey, it's fantastic! Congratulations! Everything you wanted.
you know what? We've gotta Skype your dad!
and we can actually hold this right up to the computer so he can read it himself!
he's going to be so proud of you!
you can play cat and mouse if the mouse moves to Texas. I need you here, Em congrats! A
Emily, where are you, honey? Your dad wants to talk to you!
so wait, who's Anita?
no one. Me. I was, okay.
I only said that because I didn't want Jenna to know I was there.
well, yeah, but she did know.
only after I said something.
I had to.
I thought it was safe. - No, anita was safe.
aria is not.
I feel like I just made things worse.
if Jenna is "a," I totally rattled her cage.
she's on the move.
I'm ready. - Let's do it.
is it him? Is it Ian? - I can't tell.
of course it's him, but whose car is that?
wait, that's not Ian.
is that wren? - Wren?
he's in on this, too?
what's he giving her?
probably painkillers.
Melissa does drugs? - No, not for her. For Ian.
you fall from a bell tower, you're gonna need more than an ice-pack.
only Melissa would ask the guy she dumped to help the murderer she married.
Yeah, I've seen a lot of these come through here.
this one was a real beauty.
put everything else in that case to shame.
Yeah, figured I wouldn't see her again.
there you go. I had a hunch it wasn't hers.
enjoy.
wait, that's not Ian.
what is he giving her? ...
if you continue as a Rosewood's MVP, we can offer you a full scholarship.
this means you don't have to move!
em, did you write this letter?
I found this on the doormat.
they want you on their team.
honey, it's fantastic!
Congratulations!
who's that? - Danielle.
well, does she know you're crushing on her?
who's Lucas?
Oh, my friend over there.
I'm starting a new job.
who's it for? - Jason DiLaurentis.
you can't work for him.
I need cash to buy tools and a truck.
I didn't leave without saying goodbye, so I wrote you a letter.
I'll never be able to forget that you were using me.
I'm sorry.
we just got off the phone with your therapist.
she's recommending that you spend some time apart.
you're telling me that I can't see my friends?
what's going on? What are you doing?
I'm looking for my ring. Would you mind getting up?
I'll be back for it on Monday.
as soon as the banks open, I'll have the cash.
take it. It's yours.
are you crazy?
I'm back.
I'm surprised.
um, here's my receipt for the ring.
sorry.
this place is skeevy.
she pawned her sister's wedding ring.
you're not gonna go to Tiffany's.
so... Wren and Melissa?
weird, right?
could you tell what he gave her?
no. She didn't seem happy about it.
I wonder if Ian will be.
how you holdin' up?
great.
ever since I got that fake scholarship letter, my mom thinks I can do no wrong.
I'm living a lie I didn't even tell.
leave it to "A" to make you feel bad about your mom feeling good.
here you go.
horseshoe?
is this some kind of a joke?
I I brought in a ring.
not according to the ticket.
you gave me that ticket 48 hours ago.
lot of people come through here in that time.
I need that ring back today, so I need you to get back down there behind that counter and find it.
or what?
you... want to call the police, talk to them about it?
be my guest.
I can't believe that it's gone.
at least you got your money back.
am I supposed to give her this?
I stole it I actually stole my sister's wedding ring!
just my luck diamonds are a girl's best friend.
someone is watching you so look you best...
coffee is made, newspaper is in, and your father is putting breakfast on the table.
double berry pancakes.
we we haven't had those since...
I know. I miss them.
it sort of feels like everything's finally getting back to normal around here.
I like that. - So do I.
Mike, breakfast.
I'll grab something later.
Mike, on the other hand, may not be on the same page about me being back.
no, he's fine.
why shouldn't he be? At least he has a social life.
I know this not being able to see your friends is probably really tough.
Yeah, that's an understatement.
you do know that we're only doing this because we feel it's best for you, for all of you.
now...
what?
how do I look?
nice.
nicer than usual. Why?
because today is my first day...
of being a full time teacher! Right!
sorry. I've just been kind of...
so, do they do they know what class you're gonna teach?
I'm taking over Mr. Fitz's class.
try and contain your enthusiasm.
no. It's not that.
I'm happy for you.
it'll be great.
going somewhere? - No.
why do you have your passport?
it's it's not mine. It's Ian's.
I need it for the insurance claim on my ring.
it still hasn't turned up?
it will.
I'd rather find my husband.
I'll be home after school, seeing as I can't hang out with any of my friends.
about that I was talking with Spencer's mom yesterday.
and you realized that this whole bestie ban was a terrible idea, and I can hang out with them?
no, we realized that you're the only one who hasn't been to a solo session with your therapist yet.
so?
so, your father and I think you should.
your friends have all taken it seriously.
I think it would be a good idea if you did too.
can't we just watch Intervention and say that I went?
stop.
you're going.
after school today.
my week's really shaping up.
I have a surprise for you.
what's that?
take a look.
who sent these?
well, I would imagine it's the scout you spoke to over at Danby.
who else?
Yeah.
you're right.
somebody must really want you over at that school, huh?
Hey! Can I have some of those?
have them all. I may never eat again.
the rat fall in the fry oil again?
cause last time...
it's not the food.
it's... Danielle.
yearbook Danielle? What's wrong?
what's right?
ever since you helped me score a date with her, my stomach has been like a rat fell in fry oil.
I'm completely off my game.
Lucas, you don't have game.
whatever. I'm calling this date off.
No! No! You cannot do that!
sure I can. I'll be doing both of us a favor.
I wouldn't have done this if I didn't think you two would have fun together.
and fun is good, right?
like, you enjoy fun, right?
Yeah, sure.
I mean... - Come with us on the date.
I hear it's gonna be a lot of fun.
and weird.
haven't you ever heard the phrase "three's a crowd"?
fine. Don't come alone. You can bring Caleb.
no. No, I'm sorry.
absolutely not. That's not happening.
come on, it's just one night.
you got me into this mess, and now you're gonna have to help me deal with it.
I'm going this afternoon, right after school.
are you sure that's safe?
no.
uh, can I talk to you for a second?
we were we were just saying goodbye.
Yeah, that's not what I want to talk to you about.
okay.
well, I would say you had really good mastery of the material, excellent eye contact with the students, but your handwriting could use some improvement, though.
Yeah, that's not it either, but thanks.
um, Mike left his keys at home today, and I've got a faculty meeting after school.
can you take these by his pickup game at the part after school?
Yeah, no problem. - Thanks.
and now that you mention it, the whole "not seeing your friends" thing should probably extend to the school hallways, as well.
that date is gonna be a disaster.
well, you're his "bro mate." Help him out.
I tried, but he gets nauseous just talking about it.
and I'm on the bottom bunk.
he has bunk beds?
Oh, and toys, in little boxes.
okay, they're collectibles.
you know he wants us to go with them.
I know.
it's pretty lame, huh?
Yeah.
should we? - No.
unless...
Seriously?
the kid's gonna swallow his own tongue if we don't do something.
no, seriously, you're gonna go out with me?
I'm not going out with you.
I'm accompanying Lucas and Danielle, and you happen to be doing the same thing.
we'll be his wingmen, or wing people, but that's it, you got it?
got it.
good.
Spencer, what are you doing here?
we need to talk.
I'm sorry, this is kind of important. Could you...
like, not be here right now?
what did you give to Melissa outside of our house, and what did she tell you?
it's complicated.
okay, well, let me make it a bit easier for you.
Ian tried to kill me.
what? Are you okay?
for now.
but how 'bout you tell me what you know before he tries again?
she wanted meds. Supplies.
and you were just happy to hand them over?
Ian might be hiding out next door to my house.
no, Melissa said he'd only tell her where he was once she had the drugs, but that it was somewhere outside of Rosewood.
why did you help her?
honestly?
cause I feel partly responsible for Melissa charging back to Ian.
how could I not help?
I didn't give her everything that she asked for, some of the painkillers she wanted.
I'd lose my job if I did that.
Spencer, please, you have to believe me.
I had no idea that you were a part of this.
I don't want to see you get hurt again.
it's kind of too late for that.
you need to leave this alone.
I can't leave this alone.
and I need your help.
every time I gamble with you and your sister, people end up getting hurt.
I won't let that happen again.
Wren, will you help me find Ian or not?
I'm sorry. No.
it's amazing how slowly time passes when you keep looking at a clock, isn't it?
totally.
did you speak with your friends about what it would be like coming in here on your own?
we're not supposed to talk, remember?
my guess is you find your ways.
you're best friends.
your opinions, your interactions, all are important to one another.
so why keep us apart?
perspective.
sometimes when you're given an opportunity to look at something from a different vantage point, you see different things.
what's the point of seeing things differently if you can't share with your friends?
Hanna, I can help you.
help me what?
let go.
I've talked with a lot of young people about loss.
sometimes it's feelings of guilt that's holding them back, sometimes it's anger or fear, sometimes all three.
that'd be really crazy, huh?
no, not at all.
it's quite common.
Alison is still here for you...
for all of you, isn't she?
you don't know the half of it.
maybe not.
but whatever you're feeling, you can move past it.
you make it sound like it's up to me.
you... and Alison.
I think you need to have a conversation with her.
it's a little late for that.
maybe not.
pretend Alison is sitting here, right now.
I thought talking to empty chairs was the kind of thing people come here to stop doing.
humor me.
what would you say to Alison if you could?
I'd say time's up.
Mike, it's me.
still wondering where you are, okay?
um, I'm at the park.
I'm trying to give you your keys, so pick up.
Hey, Mike!
sorry.
Lewis. Hey.
do you know where I can find Mike?
got me.
he usually plays here, though, right?
not for the last couple of months, no.
no. No, no, no. He usually plays pickup here almost every day after school.
so do we, and I haven't seen him. Sorry.
you haven't seen my brother, have you?
uh, no. Sorry.
what, he give you the slip?
something like that.
I was always lying about where I was when I was his age.
I don't remember a lot about that time, actually.
most of what I do remember, I wish I could forget, you know?
you know what I do remember?
your pink hair.
Really?
I thought it was cool.
Really?! - Really.
I mean, you you always did the unexpected, as opposed to me.
which... I also thought was cool.
I miss that pink hair.
Emily. I saw the whole meet. You're so good.
Thanks.
and I'm even more impressed by that commitment letter you got from Danby.
how'd you hear about that?
from your mom, just like everybody else at the pool.
she is totally stoked, and so am I.
I mean, Danby is a beautiful campus, and I could come visit, and...
what's wrong?
Oh, my God, you don't want to go to Danby?
or you don't want me to come to Danby?
no, it's not that.
that letter is not real.
the coach from Danby didn't write it.
I... I did.
wow, so you just mailed it to yourself? - Yeah.
something like that.
Emily. Great job, honey! Fantastic! Congratulations.
the field was kind of weak.
no, they were good, but you were better.
uh, mom, this is Samara Cook.
Hi, Samara. Pam Fields.
Emily has told me so much about you, and it's nice to finally meet.
likewise.
you know, I sent video of your winning leg of the relay to your dad, and he was so excited.
you must be overjoyed.
why don't we have a celebration tonight?
mom...
I know inviting your other friends probably isn't such a good idea right now.
right, so I don't - Samara, would you like to come?
I'd love to.
seven o'clock?
okay, great. I'll see you then.
relax.
if I'm there and the truth slips out, your mom won't get so angry.
we'll be late.
take care of your sister...
exclamation point.
mom.
that sounds like a fun evening.
you home?
okay, so, if Ian's not next door, where is he?
and where's he going?
and why is Melissa going with him?
right.
things don't usually work out well for the wives of murderers.
do you... do you think that he'd hurt her?
I don't know.
I wish I could just come stay over at your house.
me too.
I'm home alone with the doors locked, and I'm creeped out.
I gotta go. My parents are here.
okay.
mom?
dad?
what?
where were you all day?
what's it to you?
well, I...
I was trying to find you all day to give you your keys.
so, give them to me.
no.
let's forget about today.
where have you been every other day, huh?
because the guys you play ball with hardly remember what you look like.
places.
here and there.
but... but that's what you plan on telling mom and dad?
you know that they're gonna find out.
not from you, they're not, 'cause if you tell them, I'll tell them about you and your friends sneaking around town while you're supposed to be having a time out.
why are you doing this?
mom's moved in.
things are going back to normal.
you think that's all it takes?
the four of us eat pancakes together, and everything's okay?
things aren't how they used to be.
they never will be.
Hey.
refill? - Thanks.
you two doing okay?
great.
fine.
okay, well, we have to leave for the movie in 10 minutes.
it's a little too early to be channeling my inner mom.
it's a little late for that, anyway.
what are you talking about? She's totally into him.
whatever you say.
maybe they have different mating rituals in yearbook club.
what are you, the expert now?
I can read you pretty well.
well, trust me, it's going great.
this blows.
what? I'm having a good time. Are you?
I would be. I like you, but...
tell me you haven't noticed how she keeps checking you out.
uh, I don't think so.
she comes over here, like, every 20 seconds.
she's totally still into you.
well, then, why would she bring Caleb?
to make you jealous.
aren't you? - No.
I would be.
that was my fifth birthday party, my first dive.
Oh, look how cute you are.
Oh, that was so long ago.
that was the best birthday ever.
I can't believe I wore my hair like that.
did you make this scrapbook?
I did. One of many.
did you use a glue gun to stick the rice paper to the binding?
what else?
you know, that's the first thing I remember asking for for Christmas.
I think I stuck myself to every room in the house.
I still use it for some of my jewelry projects.
Really?
Yeah, my mom and I, we made some scrapbooks like this when I was a kid, but they never turned out this well.
you know, I was thinking about making a new one, sort of along the lines of a Rosewood to Danby theme.
that's a great idea.
you know, Em, you and I should probably take a tour of Danby, just get the lay of the land.
Yeah, there's plenty of time for that.
honey, it's never too soon to start doing a little bit of research.
actually, what I should do is call your scout...
and talk to him.
mom.
honey, I've got to call and thank him for the gifts, anyway.
mom.
the truth is...
the truth is, Danby has a good team, but so do a lot of other places.
my dad knows the coach at Stanford, and they have a great team.
I was just telling Emily that I think a lot of different schools will be interested in her.
you think so?
with her times? Totally.
I wouldn't get locked into Danby.
play it cool, and wait for the other offers to roll in during senior year.
that's when the real action starts.
if you contact the coach now, other places might get the wrong idea.
well, that seems to make a reasonable amount of sense.
em? - yeah. For sure.
you gotta help me, guys.
I'm circling the drain here.
I feel your pain.
what are you talking about?
Danielle still thinks that you're crushing on me.
What?! No, I told her I was over you, and, just to be clear...
okay, I get it, I get it.
but she doesn't.
do you know what it's gonna be like in yearbook tomorrow?
they're gonna dedicate a special page to how stupid I was to think that I could go out with someone like her, and I'll have to design it.
I guess I was just kidding myself, thinking that I could let go of who everyone else thinks I am and just be myself.
well, thanks for trying to achieve the unachievable.
you know what's a drag?
is how much better Lucas would be if he didn't care what everybody else thought.
I know, right?
what are we gonna do to help him?
put your arm around me.
what? - Just put your arm around me.
nice work.
it was easy.
well, I'm not.
Melissa, I've had second thoughts about the injuries you've described.
I'm concerned Ian could have a staph infection.
I'm gonna have to insist that I see him before you go anywhere.
I'll bring whatever drugs are necessary.
no, Melissa.
I come with you, or no deal.
she bought it.
she still doesn't know where Ian's hiding, but she'll call me tomorrow when she finds out - so I can go with her. - And I'll be right behind you.
please don't make me tell Danielle that you're a peeping tom.
I won't.
I just wanted to come over and say thank you for what you did last night.
you know, you've come a long way from being one of Alison's posse.
whatever.
no, seriously.
what you did, you did for me, and there wasn't anything in it for you.
that means a lot.
your appointment isn't until next week.
I know, but...
I need to talk.
Wren called you. still waiting. going crazy.
Hey, need a ride?
used to be fun when I took you to school.
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.
we're here for you, your mom and I. You know that, right?
Yeah, I do.
and I'm glad that the things that used to be fun are becoming fun again.
me too.
Hey, Mike.
how was the game yesterday?
great, like always.
aria watched for a couple of minutes.
yeah?
want a ride to school?
I'm cool.
sure, I mean we could stop and get a...
a cup of coffee.
is he okay?
Yeah, I think so.
all right. We'll leave in five.
okay.
what you said yesterday about seeing things differently. Um, I I went on a date. A a double date.
actually, it wasn't even really... - Hanna. Breathe.
you were right. Alison is still with us.
with me. More than I want.
why more? - Our friendship was work.
like like you had to impress her to make her like you, and...
that meant doing things that maybe you didn't feel so good about doing.
sometimes bad things.
if it was so hard, why was it so important to be her friend?
she could make you feel special, and that seemed worth it then.
and now?
what would you like to say to Alison?
just that...
to Alison.
you were the best friend I ever had...
and that meant a lot to me.
you meant a lot to me.
but you were also the worst enemy I ever had...
and I can't believe it took me this long to realize that.
how do you think Alison would respond to that?
well, look at you.
all independent and in touch with your feelings.
I'll bet you're pretty impressed with yourself right now, aren't you?
Yeah.
I'm proud of you, Hanna.
I don't care.
of course you don't.
today...
you've got doctor do over there ready to pat you on the back for talking to an empty chair.
I don't need her either.
well, you need someone.
low self esteem leads to "Hefty Hanna."
wasn't that covered in wellness class?
I have other friends.
real friends.
you have what I gave you.
you think your three gal pals will be with you forever, don't you?
news flash...
you're already losing them.
they're gonna move on, Hanna, and you're not.
and you know who you'll be left with?
me.
I'll always be with you.
I'm the only one that can make you happy, the only one that'll tell you the truth.
I'm the only one that you can count on.
then I'd rather be alone.
you won't last a week.
at least I'll be alive.
you can't reach into my life anymore, not unless I let you.
you're gone, and I am so over missing you.
Hey, you.
have you transferred here without telling me?
I thought about it.
no, I called you this morning, but I got your voicemail.
I wanted to see how you were doing after last night's near miss.
okay, though I feel like I just postponed the inevitable.
maybe not.
I mean, what I said last night was the truth, except for the part about my dad knowing the coach from Stanford.
but it was good advice.
and she was online this morning, checking every college with an endowment and a pool.
so it worked. - For now.
so, be happy. For now.
with me. Least it gives us time for a second date.
nosey bitches die Melissa just called. She knows where Ian is.
I'm on the way. - Spencer !
sos Mom?
we need to talk.
can it wait, because Spe I don't think it can.
I just got a call from Dr. Sullivan.
her office was broken into after your last session.
it was completely trashed.
why would she call you?
Hanna, what did you and Dr. Sullivan talk about?
isn't that supposed to be between me and her?
I mean, that's how it works, right?
was it something that somebody...
might not want other people to know?
we can't do this right now.
Yes, you can.
if Dr. Sullivan calls the police, they're gonna be asking a lot more questions than I am.
well, then, I'm gonna need answers, and I'm not getting them here!
excuse me, ma'am.
who else had keys to the office?
no one. Why?
there aren't any signs of forced entry.
do we have a plan?
working on it.
should we call Garrett, tell him about Ian? - No.
the last thing we need to do is get him involved in another mystery we can't explain.
cause that's what happens when we're the girls who cried wolf.
I mean, don't you get it?
we're screwed.
they're stopping.
there's no turning back now, right?
I've got 9 1 1 on speed dial.
I've only got one bar.
Oh, crap. No bars.
we should take a photo of Ian, prove we haven't been making this all up.
Yeah, well, you go ahead and do that while I try not to get killed.
sorry.
I'm just worried about Melissa.
who knows what Ian's thinking?
or if he has a gun.
he's the bad guy, right?
I killed alison...
I spoke to Hanna's mom and she said that she could look after you.
look at the card.
what fun "Two little liars under one roof."
you're making it so easy." --"A."
sorry to interrupt, but it's about Mike.
how was the dinner party? - It was fine...
till the cops showed up to let us know that our son had been arrested for breaking and entering.
I see you doing sketchy stuff and I worry about you.
you already know more about me than anybody else.
so why can't we just keep it where it is?
a hockey stick? - Part of one.
and it was buried?
I thought it was some old junk till your dad saw it.
you can't burn that.
I can do whatever I want with junk I find on my property.
please. - Stop it!
look, from now on, I need to figure out how to be happy, and I'd like to do that here.
so who's Jason?
Ali's brother.
no, I know that, I just didn't know he was friends of the family.
things are a little tense right now between me and Isabel.
no, you're staying here because you're still in love with mom.
we've turned a corner.
stop using me as an excuse.
you took things from Emily.
you broke into Spencer's house.
you stole from a blind girl.
I got that from Garrett Reynolds' apartment.
do the police know what kind of weapon the killer used on Alison?
that would all be in the coroner's report.
so it would say what she was hit with?
Ali's killer is dead.
it was just the two of you, sitting in Garrett's car?
I didn't know where else to meet him.
it wasn't like I could ask him that stuff down at the precinct.
how did you get away from him?
when you sent me that text, I told him it was from my mom.
she wanted me home asap.
am I still shaking? I'm still shaking.
Yeah, we're all shaking.
can you turn on the heat? You could make a slushy back here.
guys, why would Jenna give him that lantern?
you don't know that she gave it to him.
what do you think, he bought it at the blind artists' crafts fair?
of course she gave it to him.
the question is, when did they become buddies? And why?
Spencer, they grew up across the street from each other.
his parents still live in that house.
maybe he's just bringing raw meat to Jenna's cat.
Toby lives there, too, and they don't have a cat.
then maybe he was bringing over raw meat for Jenna.
here comes them.
who's living in her house now?
some losers who can't figure out the alarm system.
they've tripped it like three times.
the security company keeps calling her mom in Texas.
everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
it's just so weird to walk in there and see other people's stuff.
Hey, why don't you tell 'them to lay off the alarm for a couple of days?
I'm guessing they don't feel safe.
well, they will now.
I'm sure Aria's parents are gonna have Mike on lockdown till he turns 18.
you did not just say that, Hanna.
what?
I'm not judging.
I'm just guessing that your little brother will find another hobby besides breaking and entering.
still talking.
guys, look, I don't know what's going on with my brother.
if I knew, you would know.
isn't that Garrett's car?
I think it is.
Where's he going?
to his parents', I guess.
Oh, my God. He's going into Jenna's house.
is Toby home?
no, he went to go get his parents from the airport, and I thought he said Jenna went with him.
he's going inside. He just walked in.
can you walk any softer?
please, Jenna can't hear us.
she's blind.
you... - You know what I mean.
jeez, give it a rest, them.
I need to work on my core.
no, you don't. You were doing sit ups in your sleep last night.
I didn't sleep.
Yeah, me neither.
but why bother when you can have a nightmare just by parking in front of the Cavanaugh house?
I still can't believe it's Garrett.
that's who Jenna was buying that lingerie for.
I don't wanna talk about it. It's too early.
here, hydrate.
Oh, not that much.
I have to watch my sugar intake.
watch mine, cause I'm about to have a big ass bowl of cocoa puffs.
are you always like this before a meet?
it's not just a meet.
the scout from Danby's coming.
this could be my last chance to turn this lie around before it gets worse.
them, you only lied to your parents.
isn't that enough?
look, I'm just saying, they're in Texas now.
maybe the more time that goes by They'll forget?
it's another Zip code Hanna, not a parallel universe.
can you pass me my bag?
them, didn't you get that yesterday?
you've used a lot.
it works.
good morning.
Oh, hi.
is there enough coffee for, uh...
well, I would've made more if I knew that you...
the decision to stay over was spur of the moment.
your mom and I stretched "Happy Hour" into a whole night, and she didn't want me to drive.
Yeah, dad, you don't have to explain.
you used to live here, remember?
morning. Come join the party.
I thought you said you didn't have to be in your work till 10: 00, and you were gonna sleep in.
Yeah, well, internal alarm clock.
some things you just can't turn off.
what's this?
yesterday's mail.
was in the mail When I came home last night.
Thanks, Emily.
this is yours.
fancy.
who lives in Baltimore?
my dad.
I don't remember sending that.
you didn't.
it's from Isabel.
you're getting married in six weeks.
save the date.
Hello, Spencer.
Hi.
uh, may I come in?
Yeah, sure.
what are you doing here?
I was hoping to see Melissa.
is she here?
no, she's back in Philadelphia.
she hasn't really been back much since the funeral.
Yeah, I was hoping to attend, but I hadn't seen your parents since they asked me to disappear.
so I figured my presence might be more inciting than comforting.
so you came all this way to drop off a plant?
wasn't actually out of my way.
I just started a rotation at Rosewood Community.
you're back here? - For six months.
I applied there as my number one choice when I was engaged to your sister.
it just came through.
somebody up there has a divine sense of irony.
are the parents home?
they're not.
um, have you ever done an autopsy?
sorry?
it's just this project that I have to do for school.
I need to know if a doctor can look at a head wound and know exactly what the weapon was that caused it.
who does the autopsies down at Rosewood Community?
the hospital's pathologist.
where would he keep his records?
in the Morgue where I might nap today if I don't get a coffee.
do you mind I have one? I'm knackered.
I'm sorry, I really need to get to school.
all right, well, let me take you. We could stop for something on the way.
you didn't come all this way to see Melissa, did you?
why don't we continue this over coffee?
Wren. I have a boyfriend now.
fine. How about tea?
so what does your mom want?
I mean, if your dad ditches Isabel, would she - We'll figure it out.
they. Them. They'll figure it out.
what time is your meet? - Three thirty. But I'm practicing during lunch.
and if I can get out of sixth period early - Them, easy.
you're already wearing more pain cream than clothes.
just save some mojo for the race.
what's wrong?
who's he with?
another satisfied customer, I guess.
why don't you go inside. I'll catch up with you later.
Caleb? Hey, sorry to interrupt, but you might not wanna be doing this on the street.
Hey, Ryan. Ryan, wait up.
no, let him go.
you cannot be doing business Hey, you know what, Hanna?
no more lectures on going legit.
I'm not trading up for a paper hat at Benny's Burgers.
this is how I make my money.
get over it.
hey there.
what's going on? Why are you here?
it's my turn to teach the driver's ed class.
I'm hoping I can scare kids into watching the road instead of their cell phones.
funny, right?
Yeah, that's actually really funny. I have to go to class.
Spencer, we never finished our conversation last night.
you ran off.
I just have a lot of drama going on at my house.
is everything okay? - It's fine.
you had a lot of questions and some strong ideas about weapons and head wounds I know. I can get like that. I'm really sorry if I bothered you.
you seemed pretty distraught.
no. No, not really.
it was just, you know something that I read in biology got me thinking about Ali's autopsy, but like you said, the case is closed. So there's really nothing to worry about.
I really have to go to class.
what's up, Mike? - Hey.
so is it true? - What?
is smash and grab your new sport?
what's the deal, man?
what, are you trying on new personalities or something?
this week you're gonna be gangster, and next week you're crackhead?
bite me.
Mike Back off!
don't you guys have a class to get to?
can I speak to you for a moment?
later.
I saw you race by my building.
I didn't even realize you were coming to campus today.
Oh, I had to.
if I don't finish this thing, it doesn't get fired till next Friday.
and here I was hoping you'd be at the Potter's wheel so I could wrap my arms around you and hum unchained melody.
I've seen that movie. It ends sadly.
well, we could give it a happy ending.
can we do this later? - Yeah.
uh, how're things at home? - Sucky.
look, kids do stupid things.
probably one of Mike's friends put him up to it.
he's broken into other houses, too.
Jason caught him breaking into his house a few weeks ago.
as in Ali's brother who sat next to me at the dinner that never happened Jason?
is that what you two were talking about the other night?
Yeah.
is this yours, too? It's amazing.
Jenna made that.
she's talented.
so how're things shaping up between you guys?
she dropped the class.
Yeah, but before she left, did you guys find a way...
no. She left before I had the chance.
Aria, why didn't you tell me what was going on?
with your brother.
I didn't tell anybody.
it's embarrassing.
I get it.
but you don't have to be embarrassed with me.
about anything.
maybe you could stop by my place later...
sure.
I will call you.
Bye.
so... Should I be worried about you and this Jason guy?
what? No.
no.
dad?
how? What?
I wanted to surprise you after the meet.
is mom with you?
no, she's still in Texas. I had to be in Delaware for a training seminar and they cancelled all the flights back.
some huge storm down there.
so I figured I could either sit in the airport in Bethesda or in the stands in Rosewood.
you drove all the way up here?
well, your mom said it was an important meet.
she said that you told her that the scout from Danby College is coming.
I did?
Oh, right, I did, yeah.
I'm looking forward to meeting him. What's his name again? Rabin?
dad, I wish I'd known.
don't worry, all right? I know you have your whole pre race routine, so I'm not gonna hold you up.
go.
but if you hear somebody screaming in the stands like a crazy person, that's me.
go get them.
L31 requesting a rescue ambulance unit at Rosewood high school!
you're gonna be okay.
Oh, God!
how can I have an ulcer? I thought I just pulled a muscle.
they're caused by stress, honey.
all right, and let's face it you leaving home, your ma moving, well, you've had your fair share.
what am I supposed to do now?
when can I swim again?
that's off the table for the moment.
em, Emmy, listen to me.
listen to me.
if you're stressing about the Danby scholarship,
I want you to let it go, okay?
they're not going to withdraw the offer because you had a setback.
you don't know that.
I know that you need to rest.
you need to listen to the doctor.
I need to swim.
Hey, you will, baby.
you will...
when you're ready.
listen, do you want me to talk to this scout?
do you have the number - No, don't call him. I'll do it.
I don't mind. Or get your ma to do it.
no, I don't wanna say anything till I know when I can swim again, okay?
okay.
okay.
aren't ulcers something old people get?
get that look off your face. You're gonna freak her out.
her? What about me?
I'm having deja vu.
I spent a week in this place.
if I see another bowl of green jelly, I'm gonna puke on your shoes.
Oh, God. I'm gonna walk behind you.
is that Aria?
I'll just call him back later.
what's going on?
han, are you and Caleb...
we're fine.
there's just stuff going on.
like what?
like an undercover cop in a car following him.
Why?
I don't wanna talk about it.
you have to.
you're in an elevator. Where else are you gonna go?
does he know about the cop?
no. I haven't told him.
why not?
because I'm still thinking things through.
what is there to think through?
if I tell him, he might run, okay?
I'm not ready to lose him again.
han, if the cops are really after him, you're gonna lose him anyway.
did you just get home?
I thought you were gonna come by the hotel so we could grab some dinner.
I haven't had a chance.
Hanna came by the bank to borrow my car.
Emily is in the hospital.
what? Why? What happened?
she collapsed at school.
I just got an update it's an ulcer.
she's gonna be okay.
her dad's there.
poor kid.
do you want me to run you down there?
or we could stay in, get some food.
you should go home.
I don't want to have another meal like breakfast this morning.
this...
I don't know what this is.
but I probably shouldn't have let you stay last night.
it's confusing to Hanna, to you, to me.
it's not fair to anybody.
you're getting married, as the mailman so promptly reminded us this morning.
Ashley - Tom, I need to be with a man who's sure of what he wants.
that was never you.
so all those muscle spasms and the pain that's all coming from your stomach?
Yeah, but ulcers can heal.
it's not forever, them.
Yeah, but she's got like a hole - Yes, there's a hole in her stomach.
moving on.
Where'd your dad go?
he went to the house to talk to the new tenants.
guys, I have to deal with this.
I can't keep lying to him.
I guess not, not if it's eating holes in your stomach.
moving on!
Hey, I'm sorry. I got here as soon as I could.
I had to escape family court in my living room.
Mike on trial?
Yeah, but the defendant didn't even show up.
I got your favorite.
Oh, she can't drink coffee.
Yeah, she's got a hole in her stomach.
I'll trade it in for an herbal tea, unless you want us all here when your dad gets back.
she's not telling her dad.
if he finds out that the letter is fake, he's gonna move her to Texas.
if she doesn't tell him, she's not gonna get any better.
but she doesn't have to make up her mind right this second, okay?
she already has.
I'm telling him the truth.
it's the third floor.
you're looking for your friend Emily, right?
Yeah.
how did you know that she was here?
I saw her name on the admittance chart.
they rushed her into the E. R. but she's stabilized.
looks like we're going for a ride.
so how is she?
have you seen Emily?
I haven't, but she's in good hands.
I'll be popping in soon enough on rounds.
Spencer, you want the third floor.
what is down there?
kitchen, laundry, radiology, pathology, the morgue.
Emily has a much better view.
what makes you think they know?
last night, Spencer was hammering me with questions about the murder weapon.
whether the coroner could tell if it was used by a man or a woman.
what did you say? - Nothing.
didn't get a chance to say anything.
she cut me off and ran home.
but then when I saw her again this morning, suddenly it was off her radar.
she's playing you.
I don't think so.
do they know about Jason?
I'm not sure.
but they're definitely questioning whether Ian killed her.
we need to take care of this.
Oh, hi.
I thought Spencer was up here.
she just went down to the cafeteria to get some soup.
what, our food? Willingly?
How're you feeling?
hungry. Weak.
scared.
are you my doctor now? - No. Just checking in.
so the good news is, the meds are working and your stomach's on the road to recovery.
although I probably wouldn't celebrate this weekend with take out curry.
is there bad news?
there is bad news.
look, Emily, I know you swim competitively.
and I know the pressure every athlete's under to perform at their best, to constantly break their own records.
wait, I thought swimming didn't cause the ulcer.
it didn't, but your panels came back with high levels of HGH in your bloodstream.
human growth hormone?
I've never taken that.
Emily, if you're using a performance enhancing drug or any kind of steroid, it's going to show up in your tests.
and you need to know the perils of what you're doing.
I'm not doing anything!
this is insane! Your test is wrong!
Emily, these tests don't lie.
and I did check twice.
I'm here as a friend.
I asked your attending if I could speak to you first.
have you told my dad about this?
I haven't.
but you're a minor so he will have to know.
no, you can't.
please. Don't tell him this.
I could get kicked off the team, it'd ruin any chance of a scholarship.
slow down.
please.
I'll take the test again.
just don't tell my parents.
I'll speak to your attending. See what I can do.
Caleb, get in!
what's going on?
just hurry up! Get in!
I thought you wanted to catch a movie.
close the door!
or we can just be in one.
why are you dressed like that?
Hey, in here.
Spencer, what the hell?
talk later. You need to change.
why are you wearing - Come on!
I hope that's homework you're doing.
it is.
so you wanna tell me what happened at school today with your friend Chaz?
he's not my friend.
Really? Since when?
since I don't wanna talk about it.
okay, how about we talk about why you didn't show up this afternoon.
ignoring this will not make it go away.
and the Pirellis may not be pressing charges, but that doesn't mean you're off the hook with us.
we have no idea why you would break in to their house.
what is this all about?
what were you looking for?
I wasn't looking for anything.
well, then you went through an awful lot of trouble to get yourself in trouble.
Mike, what is going on?
I said I don't wanna talk about it!
and I said we have to!
so once again we're back on your schedule?
should I hurry up and talk fast before you move out again?
what is this place?
it belongs to Spencer's family.
I'm guessing so does most of Pennsylvania.
do they know we're here?
Nope.
so we're breaking in.
we're borrowing it.
is this kindling?
mm, not unless we wanna burn the couch.
can I help?
so are you gonna lose the scarf and shades at some point, or did you bring a costume for me, too?
Caleb, there's someone following you.
what?
I think it's a cop.
he drives a dark grey Camaro.
and I've seen him around town a lot lately.
he's definitely watching you.
you haven't noticed him? - No.
but then again, I guess I kinda stopped looking.
have you been followed before?
does this have to do with the stuff you did in Allentown?
maybe.
look, I've already told you way more than you need to know.
what does he want?
I mean, if he wants to arrest you, what's he waiting for?
what does he think you did?
I don't know.
but if he has a question to ask me, he needs to come up and ask me.
I'm not hiding.
well, maybe you should be.
your business isn't exactly in the yellow pages.
this is why you brought me here?
I thought it might be safer here.
I don't wanna hide.
Hanna, I'll deal with this.
by leaving town again?
this time? No, I won't.
you say that now, but you will.
I am not going anywhere.
but if you do, can I come with you?
I'll pack really fast.
seriously, you know that I'm good at camping.
Oh, uh, can you leave that?
I haven't eaten yet.
sure.
thank you.
your pain cream?
"a" is in our medicine cabinets too?
this has to be a new record.
how long has this been in your system?
did it damage any organs?
forget my organs!
it's on my medical chart!
it's ruined my life!
I can never swim again!
Emily, medical records are private.
not from your parents!
What're you gonna tell your dad?
I'm gonna tell him to get me out of here.
take me to Texas. I'm done.
it can't get worse than this.
Emily, remember, "A" tried to plow down Hanna with a car.
is that supposed to make me feel better?
I'm just saying that "A" tried to take one of us down and it didn't work.
Spencer, "A" taking us down.
one at a time.
Aria's probably next.
can we all go to Texas? - No! Stop it!
we're not giving in to this freak!
look, we are this close to finding out what happened to Alison.
and if "A" is the one that killed her.
and Ian.
Yeah, and then "A" is gonna be the one to leave Rosewood, not us.
Hi.
sorry to interrupt.
no worries.
uh, we actually just have to get back to work.
when did you two start volunteering for the hospital?
today's actually our first day.
we're still on hour one.
we'll take this for you.
see you later.
Bye.
how's everything at the house?
good.
I found the manual to the alarm system, changed the password.
but I told them, "you're in Rosewood, you can relax.
it's mostly for show anyway.
you feel any better?
Yeah, a little.
dad, um, I've been thinking - So have I.
and I called ma.
this whole scholarship thing it's not worth it, Emmy.
we don't want you driving yourself to more ulcers or worse.
the hell with Danby.
you swim because you love to.
or don't.
dad - Baby, we can find another way to pay for college.
and I know that there are dozens of schools out there that would be thrilled to have you, in or out of the pool.
we just want you to be happy, baby.
that's it.
Oh, it's freezing in here.
Yeah, be thankful for that.
aria Hey, focus.
I can't do this.
no, you're not doing anything, okay?
I am.
just watch the door.
what is that? Cookies?
how can anybody eat cookies in here?
they stay fresh.
okay, there's gotta be some kind of system.
here, this is it.
they've got autopsies in here dating back to 2007.
okay, D... Dehaven...
Delmore... DiLaurentis. Alison.
Hi, honey. How's Emily?
she's good. She's coming home tomorrow, I think.
what are you doing?
cleaning.
you're tossing everything you bought for dad.
where is he?
he went back home.
he's gonna call you.
well, what happened?
it was time for him to go.
did you guys have a fight? - No.
well, then why would he go back to Isabel?
because he loves her and he's going to marry her.
no, he doesn't.
he's been fighting with her.
he wants to be with you.
no. I saw the two of you act like you were on a honeymoon, sipping wine on the patio, slow dancing, laughing.
I heard you.
he slept over last night!
Yes, he did.
and I realized this morning that my week of magical thinking is over.
Why?
what did he do wrong?
you were the one who said, "things change, people grow."
they do.
I have.
I'm not sure that your father has.
I started to know what Isabel must've felt like when he was still married to me.
who cares about Isabel?
honey, I'm not going to lie to you.
your father and I were both...
indulging in a fantasy.
but that's all it was.
he's made a commitment to somebody else.
well, he can un-commit!
do you wanna be with him or not?
because I thought that's what you wanted!
no, I don't.
I'm sorry.
I know that's not what you wanna hear.
do you understand any of this?
"Occipital fontanelle"?
it's this part of your skull.
look who I'm talking to.
were you pre-med in pre school?
there's a lot in here that I don't understand.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, here is the summary page.
the impact on the posterior of the victim's cranium...
back of her head.
indicates she was facing away from the assailant.
they got her from behind.
she was ambushed.
or running away.
trying to escape.
the cranium was displaced inward upon impact...
what does that mean?
it means she was hit so hard, they dented her skull.
and the weapon was most likely a curved, blunt edge.
like a field hockey stick.
Yeah, like the one that Ali borrowed from me?
the one that Jason most likely buried in my backyard.
just keep reading.
what? What does it say?
there was dirt in her lungs.
what do you mean?
it means that she was breathing in dirt when she died.
that the blow to her head isn't what killed her.
I don't understand. - Aria...
Alison was buried alive.
Hey! Stop!
is there a problem?
Yeah, there's a problem.
you stalking Caleb is a problem.
he knows why you're here.
Really?
Yeah, and he's not going back.
you know, he's finally got his life together and you're not gonna pull it apart.
I don't know who you are or what you want, but there are people in this town who love him and will protect him.
so I don't think you're gonna get what you want by spying on him.
so get lost.
you took this?
we're gonna give it back.
just look at the summary page.
that must be Hanna.
no, it's Ezra. I was supposed to call him.
Oh, go ahead.
he's downstairs.
I'll be back. - Yeah.
"displaced cranium"?
"Curved blunt weapon"?
that's a hockey stick, them.
aria doesn't want to hear this, but Jason is looking worse and worse.
is there anything I can do? - No.
no, we're just here keeping her company.
so you think you're going straight home from here?
I mean, if you're up for company, you could stop by my place.
you need to get that?
what? No.
no, it's just my dad.
Ah, I should probably get home after this.
they're pretty worried.
okay.
another night?
of course.
just tell me when.
I'm telling you, he knows I'm tailing him.
I'm sorry, but it looks like he doesn't want to see you.
maybe you should at least call your dad.
Why?
we're never gonna be that.
Where's page five?
did you drop one of the pages? - No.
we took the whole file.
maybe it dropped in the elevator.
no, nothing dropped in the elevator.
look, here's page 1, 2, 3, 4...
page 6.
where the hell is page 5?
this is how I heard the story.
the twins played so nicely while they waited for their parents to get home.
but they wouldn't get to go trick-or-treat that night...
or ever again.
Alison! He's gonna go home and tell his parents the story and I'm gonna get fired.
come on, hanna, he loves it. Right?
you've been warned.
she lifted the knife high into the air, and then plunged it deep into her sister's chest!
a sick smile came across her face as she watched the blood ooze out of her sister's heart.
and they had no choice but to send her away to a home for the criminally insane.
and that's where she remained until... Yesterday when she escaped and vowed return to rosewood and stab to death every child who dares to go trick-or-treating on halloween!
so what do you think, em?
should hanna be "cute britney" or "bald britney"?
if she wants to be, cute britney.
Aria?
she's not gonna shave her head.
Spencer, you're worse than my father.
sorry. But I did just procure nine votes from the debate team.
wait, that's a good thing, right? - Yeah.
and "procured" means to obtain with special effort.
and "obtain" means to - Are you gonna recite the entire dictionary?
I think that hanna should be who she wants to be.
fine.
but you better wear the tightest skinny pants you can fit your big butt into.
Ben? - He's all about me going as a sexy cop for halloween.
but I'm thinking indian girl.
what a shame.
all that testosterone and not a sheep in sight.
careful, alison. I get your jokes, but someday you might meet a guy who doesn't.
so am I gonna see you at my party on friday?
um, I didn't know we were invited.
your ali's friends, right?
come prepared to be scared.
did we just get invited to noel kahn's halloween bash?
I'm a little embarrassed by how excited you girls are.
it's just a party. - Ali, it's not just a party.
it's the party.
you're right.
and I'm happy we'll be there together.
we should get ready together.
Spence, you've got let's have it there.
is that cool? - Yeah.
hold up. I think there's somebody in there.
are you just trying to scare us?
no, I swear, I just saw someone in the window.
well, kids go in there all the time around halloween.
it's like a rite passage in this town.
I wish they'd just tear this place down already.
every time I walk by here I get the creeps.
it's just an ugly old house, aria.
I can't explain it.
I just... I feel like something really bad happened here.
there's nobody in there.
come on.
are you moving?
my dad got married again. They're moving in.
are you okay with that?
it hasn't been that long since your mom - It was a year ago last week.
you said "they." does she have any kids?
a daughter.
what's she like?
she gets what she wants.
damnit! Noel!
admit it. You were scared.
you need to bring that to halloween.
I'll bring a lot more than that.
good.
lady g?
I wasn't gonna dress up this year, but I got invited to some party, so...
whose party? - Uh, noel somebody.
Noel kahn. I'll be there.
and I'm going as lady g.
she's so new, I thought I was being original.
you still have time to pick something else.
you're right.
maybe I'll see you there.
I know who you'll be.
and you'll surprise me.
I'm alison.
I know. I'm jenna.
freak!
do you think i'm photogenic?
my grandmother was a sweater model. I look like her.
of course, she's old now and she smells terrible.
but I don't have to see her much 'cause she lives in georgia.
my turn.
it's hd, so...
the image is perfect, right?
I like what I see.
it's perfect, spence, it's got humor, heart, it's inspiring- I wish I could be there to hear it.
wow, spence, you got melissa's stamp of approval.
must be a good speech.
well, it better be.
my parents are already planning my victory party.
I guess that's what happens when you've got a perfect older sister.
no, alison, that's what happens when you're a hastings.
I didn't make the rules.
besides, spencer deserves to win.
her agenda is top-notch.
Thanks, melissa.
it's comforting to know that spencer can count on you.
so, melissa, did you tell spence what we decided on for halloween?
Bonnie and clyde.
cool.
sorry.
he's in a meeting.
Yeah, I was just leaving him a note.
Yes, I forgot my briefcase again.
Yeah. Mom saw it in the kitchen.
Hey, meredith. Didn't realize you were here.
I need a quite place to read. Hope that's okay.
sure.
so, um, want to grab a coffee or something?
I can't. I promised mom i'd be home for dinner.
okay.
well, see you in class. - Sure.
what's her story?
students crash here all the time.
cause you're so cool.
Yeah, 'cause i'm down with that.
come on, gimme a break.
he's out there!
he's waiting for us!
he's coming to kill us! We're gonna die!
don't answer it!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, is anybody there?
were you at the costume shop today? - Alison?
did you send me a text? - No.
Why? Ali, what's wrong?
forget it. - I've gotta go.
everything's fine.
your mom didn't do anything wrong, she did the right thing.
I had a few martinis at the grill.
then she wisely accepted my offer to drive her home.
so here's your keys.
thank you, officer.
I'm glad I could help. And it's darren, by the way.
okay. I'll take it from here.
good night. - Good night.
I'm sorry, hanna.
so what? You had too much to drink. Who cares?
no, not that. About the mess we're in.
I should have seen it coming.
I'm not gonna let you feel bad for what dad did to us.
he's the one who should be rotting in hell.
okay, stop. He's still your father.
how bad is the mess we're in?
I will take care of it, honey.
you remember what I told you, right?
she's pretty ugly.
how ugly is pretty ugly? - Hideous.
and don't even get me started on her big ass.
don't forget to buy your halloween festival tickets.
if you haven't cast your vote for sophomore class president, you have until fifth period to do so in the multi-purpose room.
em, you need to go talk to ben.
what's going on?
he's been telling all of his guy friends that you guys had sex last weekend.
what?
em, I will go over there with you. Let's shut this thing down right now.
Aria, don't.
Emily, you can't just ignore this.
Oh, my god.
is it true?
why didn't you tell us?
tell us what?
Hi, you guys.
if you ignore it, it will go away.
Ben's telling people we had sex.
what?
and he's still breathing because?
it's true.
I can't believe emily lost her vee before any one of us did.
why is that so hard to believe?
I didn't mean anything by it, I just thought you were a prude.
shy on the streets...
sexy in the sheets.
I knew there was something different about you.
do you hear mona?
Hey, aria! Hey, guys!
is she ever gonna get a clue? What a dork. Switch.
ever heard of knocking?
you want to keep me out, put a lock on it.
what are you and your stoner buddies doing behind your locked door?
you really want to know?
gimme twenty bucks. I'm buyin' the beer tonight.
twenty bucks for a secret?
you're so cheap.
we're making a movie.
what kind of movie?
if I told you that i'd have to kill you.
this was on the porch.
goodbye.
it's my turn to torture you.
did you find anything good?
well, I could be a maid for the hacken family, or a nursemaid for a dirty old man.
this is interesting.
mom, it's that cop.
wait in the kitchen.
ran into the mailman out here.
thank you.
I patrol the neighborhood, so I thought i'd stop by and see how you were doing.
I'm fine. - Good.
and your daughter, she's all right? - We're both fine.
I'm sure it's not easy to adjust to living without a man in the house.
we're adjusting.
well, listen, if you ever need anything, i'm available.
I think you might have misunderstood the situation last night.
I just needed a ride home.
this is just me, trying to be nice.
thank you.
you should watch yourself on the roads out there.
what are you suggesting?
people are unpredictable...
that's all.
have a nice day.
what was that?
that was a horny cop.
but I think he gets it.
I'm sure we won't see him again.
I thought you were hanging out with aria.
she wasn't feeling that great after we stopped for yogurt.
something happened.
what is it?
I've got a friend on the election committee.
I thought for sure you were a shoo-in, but...
did I lose?
they're still counting...
but it's gonna come down to a handful of votes.
ali, I wasn't kidding when I said that my parents have already planned this party.
they booked a room, they've invited like half the club.
I'm sure melissa's made a few of those calls.
wake up, spencer.
the big sister act is just that-an act.
and she's such a martyr with the hastings family crap.
she works so hard to be perfect because she doesn't want your parents looking beyond the glow of her halo.
she doesn't want them to see you.
Melissa's just trying to survive in this family, just like me.
are you sure about that?
because it feels like she's winning, and you're not.
if I lose tomorrow, ali...
look, if you really want this...
I can make it happen.
I don't want it, ali...
I need it.
I've been calling you all afternoon.
Where's mom?
she took mike to the movies.
are you okay?
what does she know? - Nothing.
how could you do this to her?
listen...
what you saw was the end of something, not the beginning.
she's transferring out of my class. I won't see her again.
and that's supposed to make it okay? - No... No.
but I'm hoping that it's enough for you to realize that you don't need to tell your mom about this.
Seriously?
then- You're asking me to lie for you?
I made a mistake.
but it doesn't have to be any bigger than it is right now.
would you still think it was a mistake if I hadn't seen you with her today?
Yes.
all I'm thinking about right now is your mom, and this family.
it's too late for that.
Aria, you have every right to be mad at me.
I'm just hoping that this can be less about that and more about protecting your mom.
I don't think I can ever forgive you for this.
I'm so sorry
well, I will respect whatever your decision is.
I know a doctor if you want to go on the pill.
he'll see you without telling your mom.
I don't need to go on the pill.
you can't be too careful, emily.
I mean, juno was a cute movie, but I wouldn't want to live it.
it's not that.
I don't need to go on the pill because I'm not having sex.
it was that bad?
it didn't happen.
Ben and I made out, but I didn't give it up.
then why is he telling people he took the v. i.p. Tour to neverland?
I don't know.
what aren't you telling me?
it's no big deal.
eventually we'll do it, so people can think it now or they can think it later.
I can't figure you out.
can we just keep this between us?
I don't want to keep having this conversation. Sure.
will you stop stressing? I took care of it.
took care of what?
I helped her with her acceptance speech.
easy on the coffee, spence.
your hand's already shaking.
are you kidding? Spencer bleeds caffeine.
you okay, sweetie? - I'm fine.
what's wrong, aria?
how's your mom? - ali.
I- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, ali.
don't touch me.
it was just an accident.
is that what the doctors told your mom and dad at the hospital? What?
I've heard the stories about you, hermie.
my name is lucas.
you'll always be hermie to me.
do you still have both?
what are you talking about?
come on, girls.
both what, ali?
parts, hanna. He's half-guy, half-girl.
one day she'll get what's coming to her.
students, the wait is over.
to say it was a tight race is an understatement.
winning by two votes, please congratulate spencer hastings, your new class president!
Where's your costume?
I'm just not really feeling like going to a party, but I wanted to see you guys all dressed up.
what's this about, aria?
Oh, my gosh! You guys!
there's somebody out there.
he's watching us.
Oh, my god. Who is that?
I am so creeped out.
whoever it was, they're gone.
that was freaky.
it's halloween, hanna.
don't you love a good scare?
it's probably the pizza guy.
hurry up before he leaves.
I don't want to go down alone.
I'll go. - Yeah, me too. I'm hungry.
can I talk to you, aria? - Yeah.
nobody likes a downer, aria...
and since you saw your dad kissing that tart, you're like an energy suck every time you walk into a room.
ali, I'm kind of dealing with a lot right now. Can you cut me some slack?
are they getting a divorce? - no.
if I were your mom - She doesn't know.
I knew your dad would talk to you out of it.
I'm so overthinking about this.
I just want to go to a movie and bury my face in vat of popcorn.
you committed to this party, aria.
there's gonna be a gazillion people there. Nobody's gonna miss me.
I will.
well, I appreciate that, but I just - You know, it wasn't easy scoring you an invite.
a week ago noel kahn didn't even know your name.
Yeah. Yeah, I get it, okay? I just...
I'm sorry.
I didn't tell the girls about what happened.
I'm sure you appreciate that.
I do... Thanks.
are you sure we're the only ones who saw them?
I'd hate for your mom to find out from someone else.
would you actually do that?
trick or treat, aria.
the band's gonna take a break, they'll be back in a few.
is the doctor in?
actually, i'm a gynecologist.
care to make an appointment?
hot chick, britney, hot witch, hot indian chick...
and, Mary queen of scots.
he doesn't know who that is. Does anybody?
she born to be queen, but her cousin stole the throne, and then she was accused of treason and her family had her executed.
it's my song, let's hit the dance floor!
Oh, my god, another lady gaga?
who is that? - Jenna.
meow.
do I know you?
no, but you will.
you guys are so nice, I already feel like I belong here.
rosewood's a friendly town.
I decided to wear my original costume.
you look great. Maybe even better than me.
scram.
you say "froggy," they jump.
they're not as dumb as they look.
they know they need me.
Congratulations.
I can make it really easy for you to fit in here.
if I accept you, everybody does.
I know how it works.
we're a tight group, but I think there's room for one more.
I really appreciate the offer...
but I like to pick my own friends.
you're definitely the best gaga.
better not tell alison that.
she doesn't scare me.
I'm jenna. - I'm mona.
I saw you talking with that new girl.
what were you guys talking about? - Nothing.
she's a slut.
here. You should get rid of the evidence.
I thought you'd look at them first.
you'd be surprised to know who your friends aren't.
why do we have to go to the woods to get a drink?
why can't he have a keg like a normal person?
because he's not just a normal person.
he's noel kahn.
I guess we made a wrong turn somewhere.
I'm not that thirsty anymore.
okay, let's just go back.
were you wishing you could taste her cherry chapstick? - What?
don't worry, em.
your secret's safe with me.
Hey.
have you seen ali? - Not lately.
okay... I used to think that I was born in the wrong century, but now that I've actually gone to the bathroom in this thing...
have you seen ali?
last I saw her she was at the bonfire.
you don't think she'd bail on us, do you?
that's weird.
Oh, it's from ali.
I'm in trouble. Come alone.
what's the address?
it's 313 mockingbird.
I am not going in there.
no. This is some kind of joke.
she's not in there.
what if it's not a joke?
this isn't funny anymore, ali.
it was just the wind. Come on.
you guys.
it's locked.
did you see him? Is he still here?
who?
come on. Come on.
I don't know who it is.
ali, what is going on?
he grabbed me at the party.
I tried to scream, but he's got a knife.
for real?
he said he brought me here to kill me.
I'm calling 911.
he locked me in a closet, and when he opened it, I just freaked on him.
I've been hiding up here ever since.
I'm not getting a signal.
there's nobody out there.
ali, it's probably just somebody trying to scare you.
it's that guy that was watching us at spencer's.
he's wearing the same costume.
we have to get out of here now.
I'm not going anywhere until we know that freak's gone!
look, I called you from the hallway, I know I've got a signal there.
lock the door behind me.
Ali. - Are you sure?
no, ali, don't.
don't open this door for anyone but me.
lock the door.
help!
it's jammed!
you guys, it's jammed!
No!
Oh, my god.
Emily, are you okay? Let's go!
you guys, please! Move!
you guys, come on!
come on!
look at you four.
you're scared to death.
I totally got you.
it was a hoax.
the zombie was noel.
happy halloween.
ketchup.
want some, hanna?
come on, you guys...
it was funny.
we're not laughing.
well, you should be.
you guys passed the test.
what test?
the way you guys came charging in here...
I know I can count on you now.
if I really need you, you'll be there for me.
let's go.
we're missing a party.
I feel like we came back to a different party.
I know, everyone's so much older.
what's your sister doing here?
Oh, these must be eric's friends.
he's noel's older brother.
what that saying?
boys play with toys and girls play with boys.
I haven't heard that one.
who's that guy dressed up as a cop?
that's not a costume. He's a real cop.
do you know him? - No.
um, I've just... Seen him directing traffic.
bitch.
who is that?
don't hate me, okay?
are you kidding? It was perfect.
you're not mad? - no!
the way you shoved me against that wall? You even scared me.
uh, I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Noel. We know that it was you. Alison told us.
if somebody messed with you guys, it wasn't me.
my brother took the car for a beer run.
I've been stuck here all night.
if you're lying to me- I'm not.
if it wasn't you...
who is it?
dolls?
this is the police! Stay where you are!
they set us up!
I wish I could see those bitches right now.
there's nothing left to link us to that night.
what I want is for you to forget about me.
if you really want to worry about somebody, why don't you worry about your sister and that cop boyfriend of hers.
I'm in love with your daughter.
this was going on while you were her teacher?
you are gonna leave this house right now. - Dad!
we're moving back to Rosewood-- Me, Isabel, Kate.
I want the box that Jason gave Aria.
well, you're not gonna get it. We're not gonna be making any kind of a deal with "A.
a took the bait.
want to make a deal?
you're afraid we found something, something in this box.
No! Emily!
that's "A's" cellphone!
how hard did you hit him-- her-- it?
didn't run like a her.
I thoug it was an animal. - It was. Is.
okay, where is the box?
you guys, this phone is locked.
and where were you guys? I thought we were supposed to meet up here.
wasn't that the plan? - I'm so sorry, Em.
I-I dropped a huge bomb at home. My parents won't let me go anywhere. I had to crawl through Mike's window.
and Toby came in and totally cornered me with all of these questions about why I was acting this way, and he would not leave without any answers.
Kate's moving to Rosewood.
What?!
Yeah, my dad and Isabel got married, and now they're looking for a house here in Rosewood.
so now I have more than one monster in my life. Okay? I win.
no, you don't! I was almost killed!
these are not highlights, Hanna. This is glass in my hair!
you guys, can you talk to me for a second? I'm holding "A's" phone in my hand. What are we doing with it?
something, before "A" knows we have it. - Stand still.
Hanna, call Caleb! - Why?
he's the best way that we can get information off of this.
leave him out of this.
but he's our best shot at tracing this back to "A.
there are other people. We'll take it to the phone store tomorrow.
the-- the phone store?
well, then, call technical support! We can have someone in Pakistan do it!
this can't wait until tomorrow.
once "A" realizes it's missing--!
I get it, okay?
but this phone is connected to Jenna and officer Garrett.
Caleb already has bad history with her and the police. We're not going there!
okay, but if he can find something that finally nails the two of them together-- at least consider it.
Hanna, come on, think this through. - I am.
okay, you done thinking? 'Cause we're running out of time here.
wait, is Caleb still crashing with Lucas? Where's Lucas' house?
I'll go over right-- - Spencer, stop giving us orders! We're not your winged monkeys!
guys, stop!
there's got to be a way that we can get Caleb to help without- - Answer it.
answer it.
answer it! - Why me?
I've got glass in my hair!
I'll answer it! What do you want me to say?
should we tell them that we have the phone?
they'll know that when you say hello.
it's blocked.
I've got Caleb's number! I'm calling him! - Go!
what's that number?
tells me how much data is currently loaded on the phone.
it's a lot.
you mean like photos, videos...?
definitely more than angry birds.
and how long will it take to download?
we're not there yet.
Hanna. You all right? - Yeah.
all right, can somebody tell me whose phone this is? - We can't. Yet.
the less you know right now, the better.
O-kay. Well, then, can somebody at least tell me why Emily smells like a bag of mulch?
wait. Something just came up.
crap. - What does it say?
phone got bricked. - Translate, please.
the owner shut down the phone from their computer.
so we lost everything? - We never had everything.
I have some files, but they're locked and they're probably corrupted.
I can try and retrieve what I have, but it's gonna take a while.
are you sure you want me to work on this? - Yes!
Hanna, are you all right with this?
morning.
um, where are you going? - School.
wearing that? - Yeah. What are you talking about?
well, that's not appropriate for school, so... change your clothes.
since when have I had a dress code, dad?
since we became aware of who you might be dressing for, so change your clothes.
okay, well, what am I supposed to wear, a down parka?
Byron, I've-- I've got this.
if I were you, I'd pick and choose my battles.
since when did wearing knee-highs become a battle?
today is not the day to question your father. - Why?
he, of all people, coming down on me for an inappropriate relationship?
Aria! - I'm sorry.
I just thought maybe at least...
you would... - That I would what?
that I would give my teenage daughter and Mr. Fitz my blessing?
your father and I are in agreement here because we were lied to for a really long time by you and by a colleague.
well, I didn't tell you guys because I was scared that you would react-- react like this.
Yeah, well, evidently you know us a lot better than we know you, but that's gonna change 'cause you're gonna be spending a lot more time with your family and a lot less time with your friends.
what does Ezra have to do with my friends?
and you're gonna be cutting him off completely, and that means not even saying goodbye.
is that clear?
do you like him? - What?
do you like him? - I did.
Hi.
Hey, could we talk?
can we do it someplace a little bit more private?
look, I know that you want answers, and I'm close, I'm so close to giving them to you, but it's... It's just still not safe.
then why did you come here?
because I missed you.
shutting you out is killing me.
so you came here to tell me you can't be here.
Hey! - Hey, you.
what are you working on?
you and your friends gave me homework, remember?
you're doing that here?
nobody knows what I'm working on.
so, uh, when do I get inducted into this secret society?
Hey, I like playing Mission: Impossible as much as the next guy, but, uh, I'm starting to feel like somebody doesn't trust me.
who? Me? Caleb! Come on, I trust you.
but... not with this.
we have gotten naked together in more ways than one, Han.
why are we suddenly strangers when it comes to a stolen phone?
it wasn't stolen; We found it.
why don't I believe that?
Oh, hey, Lucas!
are we still on for after school?
you know, I might be... Please don't bag on me.
okay, if I don't get at least a B-plus on this test... Please. Please. Please.
fine. I can give you, like, an hour.
you're a good man, Lucas.
so, can we talk about this phone stuff later? - Maybe.
see you at lunch.
I don't-- I don't get it!
I don't understand, Jenna!
Hey, hey! Can we not do this on the phone, please? Please, I'm outside your house.
stop punishing me and just open the damn door!
please!
what is going on?
it's been like Fight Club since last night.
they were arguing on the porch. She slammed the door in his face.
this started last night?
I think it's nerves. Jenna plays it cool, but she's freaking about having the eye operation.
yeah? Well, that's what happens when it's not just the two of us.
no, no, the mistake was pulling in somebody else.
asking him to help us was a bad idea, Jenna.
it was a bad move. No, no, I warned you. No. It was your idea.
this doesn't sound like it's about an eye operation. Who is "he"? Who are they talking about?
just-- can you-- can you wait just a second? Jenna, don't hang up.
Jenna, no, wait. Just wait a second. Don't hang up, just come to the door.
damn it!
Emily, you've got about five more minutes.
is there any way I can take this on Monday?
I didn't have time to finish the last few chapters.
it's a makeup test, Emily.
the class has moved on to another book.
what about after school tomorrow?
I can't. I have community service. They gave me additional hours for... fighting with Spencer.
are you still picking up trash? - Phone calls.
it's a community crisis hotline, and today is my first day.
well, you girls seem to have a lot of experience with crises.
maybe you can help someone learn how to avoid them.
how 'bout after school on Monday?
what else do I not know about my daughter?
I don't know what you mean.
wasn't fair of me to ask that. Sorry.
Aria's the same person she's always been, someone you can be proud of.
nothing's changed.
Hey, there, it's Ezra. Can't talk, but you can, soon as you hear the...
Hi, it's me.
,I'm using Hanna's phone 'cause I'm scared my dad's gonna start combing through my phone bills.
it's still pretty intense, but...
but that doesn't mean it can't change. They're gonna come around. I-I know that they will.
I love you so much. I hate not being able to see you.
Thanks.
Hey. How was your test?
I'm doing a makeup of a makeup.
I've got to run. Community service starts at 4 P. M.sharp.
wait. Yours is today? I was hoping you'd be able to come snoop around Jason's house with me.
Jason's? Why Jason?
well, if Jenna and Garrett have a helper, and it's a he, where does your mind go?
it's going to community service. Ask Aria.
I did. She's under house arrest. And besides, she really believes that Jason's been out of town for weeks.
offer her your lake house. She needs some serious face time with Caleb.
my lake house? - I've already made some memories on that couch in the living room.
she-- she didn't tell you?
that was my Nana's couch.
so, who ditched the Union first? South Carolina? Did we make a card for them?
Hello? What's going on?
um, sorry, I was just...
uh, thinking about Louisiana.
please don't check out on me.
okay, I need you. I can't even spell "Louisiana.
is that Caleb? - Spencer.
why don't we have a card for Maryland?
border state-- didn't secede until after the war began.
what was that about?
uh, she offered me and Caleb her lake house.
and you're not interested?
Oh, I'm interested, but if I wait an hour, she might throw in maid service, and if I wait two hours, she might send a helicopter to take us there.
I'm gonna make a new card for Virginia.
or if I waited three hours, she might let me have Caleb's birthday party there.
Oh, my God, that's awesome-- a surprise party at the lake house!
Oh, look. We have two cards for North Carolina.
Lucas, you could help me. We could do it together.
no, no, you don't need me.
of course I need you. You're, like, his best friend.
you're roomies. You're like Patrick and Spongebob.
look, Hanna, if we're not gonna study, I really need to get going.
that lake house is perfect. It's secluded.
there's a dock, a rowboat, a pier, and, you know, we could hang a big sign there.
that sounds really fun... and pricey.
I'm not really in a position to pitch in.
no. No, I'll pay for everything.
I just need your help.
Caleb's probably never even had a birthday party before.
and if we do this, it would mean a lot to him.
you'll find a contract in the back of the packet.
every volunteer must sign it.
this protects you and the caller.
there must be anonymity on both sides of the phone.
you look overwhelmed. Relax.
none of you will be answering any calls until you've had some training.
keep in mind, most of the time they really just need someone to listen.
so, who wants to read with me?
Emily? Here. Help me out.
this is a transcript of a call that came in last night. Ready?
crisis hotline. Can I help you?
I need to talk to someone.
I'm in a bad place,and I don't know what to do.
I almost got caught tonight.
Well,calling here is a good start. Uh,let's talk this through .
I was asked to do something important, and I tried my best, but I screwed it up.
you don't understand. It's gone,and I can't get it back.
okay. But maybe we can figure this out,and the situation all I could do is shut it down.
shut what down? Can you tell me exactly what you've lost?
they're never gonna forgive me. They're gonna make my life a living hell. I might as well be dead.
did this person call here last night? And was it a man or a woman?
not relevant. Let's continue.
Emily... You okay?
what?
sorry.
may I come in?
Ella and I once went to a party in this building, back in grad school days.
do you want some water, or a-- a beer? - No, no thanks.
I, uh, I've been thinking a lot since you came over to our house.
Yeah, yeah, Byron, I- - No, let-- let me get this out.
I've been teaching for 17 years.
I know how tricky it can be to navigate some teacherstudent relationships, and I have made some bad choices that I later regretted, though it didn't involve a minor.
and I also know that my daughter went through a very traumatic year...
and that you were there for her...
in a way her parents couldn't be.
but that doesn't make it okay.
so, before I leave here tonight, I want your assurance that this was a mistake, and that it's over, and that you will never see Aria again.
look, as soon as I realized she was my student, I knew it was wrong.
which is why I took the job at Hollis.
you giving that to me was an incredible gift, and I...
has she been here?
sorry, what?
is this where you spent your time together?
Byron, as I said-- I heard what you said.
I don't think you heard me.
you're never seeing Aria again. Ever.
and I will make sure that the police see to that.
okay, so, clarification: Is our invitation coming by snail-mail?
what?
did you send it to my address or hers?
I didn't think you'd want to come.
to a rockin' party at Spencer's lake house?
I can see where you'd be confused.
we'll be there.
Yeah, um, it's a surprise party. For... Caleb.
surprise!
he and I are friends now. All is forgiven.
I almost got caught tonight.
it's gone, and I can't get it back. I might as well be dead.
tell me that does not sound like "A's" helper.
they let you keep this? - No! They don't know I have it.
okay, so I have good news and I have bad news.
have you seen this? - Are you kidding?
I woke up to it. Emily taped it to our bathroom mirror.
we knew that it wasn't Jenna in the greenhouse, but now it looks like it wasn't- - it was her drone.
okay, I think that we should all be working at this crisis hotline.
I mean, if "A's" helper calls back, we can- - Nnnn...No. No.
I can't work at a hotline. I'm on lockdown.
I can barely even pee without a chaperone.
wait, you're coming to my surprise party, right?
Nope, not unless you're throwing it in my closet.
Hey, guys, you got a minute?
I finally cracked one of these files...
but I'm guessing that wasn't what you were looking for.
what are you looking for? - No, this is-- this is really great.
could you please forward this picture to all of us?
I really have to get to class.
Thanks, Caleb. - Yeah, thank you.
Hanna, what else happened when I was in California?
you, your friends, everyone's acting really strange-- even Lucas.
no one's looking me in the eye.
well, I'm looking at you, and I'm wondering what to get you for your birthday dinner.
we can get takeout, just for the two of us.
what do you want?
how 'bout a big, steaming plate of the truth, starting with this found phone.
no, Caleb, I didn't lie about that.
I just can't say any more.
and you don't think that's a problem for us?
no, it's not a problem.
we don't have a problem, do we?
we do if you're holding back the important stuff.
that's not the important stuff.
this is the important stuff.
I mean, he actually stood there in front of me justifying his behavior.
you should have been there. - Yes, I should have.
well, I followed an-- an impulse, Ella.
what are you looking for? - An aspirin!
how did this family go from a happy Christmas card in Europe to this fractured, deceitful mess?
Ella, don't give me that. Stop.
you know,"greetings from dysfunction junction.
that one can't go to school because he's too depressed, and this one only goes so she can date her teacher.
all right, that's it. I'm calling the police.
no, you're not. - Why not?
because we have a daughter whose reputation will be ruined just as much as his.
she just got done doing community service last week!
Ella, I really think-- - No! Stop!
it is hard enough for her to walk through this town.
the bell tower, and then the shovel.
do you really want to subject your daughter to more police scrutiny?
do you want to see him get away with this? - Of course not.
but before we pick up our torches and pitchforks, let's take a moment and figure it out.
I want to protect Aria.
we raised her to be independent and open-minded, and we don't get to be shocked if that is now who she is.
Mr. Fitz? - Hanna.
what are you doing here?
Oh, I picked up a birthday cake from the bakery around the corner.
actually, could you please leave that open?
Yeah, sure.
look, I know what's going down with Aria's parents, and...
I just want to say that the rest of us don't feel the same way.
two people who love each other that much should be together.
crisis hotline. Can I help you?
Yes, we did. How are you today?
I'm glad you reached out again. Has the situation gotten worse?
much.
I'm in way too deep. I had to do something. I-I don't have a choice.
we always have choices.
no, no. I should have known better.
I just... I just got sucked in, and it made me feel like...
like I finally had some power, and now I-I just can't make this go away without...
that's Lucas!
I never wanted to hurt anybody, but now I have to.
take a breath.
maybe I can help you come up with a solution.
no, there is only one solution, and it's not gonna be pretty.
I know what I have to do.
I just... hate to do it.
Hanna... This is more important than a perfect bow.
just listen to us. - We both heard the voice.
it was definitely Lucas on the other end.
no, you both heard what you wanted to hear.
Lucas may be able to get his hands on illegal firecrackers, but that don'n't mean he's "A's" evil elf.
Hanna, you don't know that, okay? Lucas hated Alison just as much as Jenna did.
she could have easily recruited him. It wouldn't take a whole lot of persuasion.
no. He has been an incredible friend to me.
he brought Caleb back to town. He's now helping me throw this party.
so he can play you. So he can gain your trust.
I mean, for all we know, he still sees Alison whenever he looks at us.
no, he's over that.
okay, well, maybe "A" is pressuring Lucas just like "A" did with us.
I mean, if "A" has something on him- - Did you record this conversation?
do you have any other proof? - No, of course not.
well, then, drop it.
Hanna! It was Lucas that was in the greenhouse.
that's who dropped the phone. That's who you hit with your car.
Really? Did you see bruises through the telephone too?
Lucas has had my back for a long time, okay?
he may have had an axe to grind with Alison, but which one of us didn't?
Hanna. - No.
just leave it alone.
he's too easy of a target.
Hello? - Ezra.
you shouldn't be calling here.
no, I-I know. I really needed to hear your I know. Me too.
but you can't call here any more.
was she alone?
was there anybody else in that car going to Boston with Jenna?
I have no idea.
that was supposed to be me in that car with her.
what happened? - I don't know.
she turned on me, Toby. - She does that.
all I ever did was everything she asked me to do, and one day, she decides that's not enough.
when Jenna doesn't need people any more, she gets rid of them.
all I said was, this town is not good for her, and I just wish we could get out of here-- y-you know, move on.
maybe she's having too much fun settling scores.
Hey, your stepsister's been through a lot, all right?
if it were me and I had to learn everything all over again, I'd be curled up in some corner.
she makes the rest of us look like cowards.
I never questioned her strength, just how she uses it.
Yeah, well, you don't understand her.
you're right, I don't.
but it looks like she found some new friends who do.
Oh, yeah? Who are her friends?
you could just walk away, Garrett. I did.
the difference is, I'm in love with her. And if I have to keep proving that to her, I will.
are you sure they're up here? - Yes.
my mom bought, like, a zillion tiki torches for my dad's 40th, so they've got to be up here somewhere.
is it worth taking a second shower for?
what is all this stuff?
well, the furniture is my Nana's, and the spiders, they came with the house.
that's the food. Keep looking, I'll be right back. - Okay.
Oh, my God. "A's" been up here.
Hanna, is that you? - It's me.
what are you doing here?
looking for some tools.
Why?
to hang the birthday banner.
Yeah, but... Why up here? How did you... even know to come up here?
I just... figured they would be stored up here.
you know, some people...
some people like to store their tools in the attic.
Yeah. We don't.
did Mike need us to pick him up? - No.
Gavin's mom was gonna take him home. They were gonna stop and get a pizza.
you know what? We'll eat somewhere else.
Byron... - No, there are other restaurants.
Aria, come on, we're not staying here. - Mom.
let's just go somewhere else.
Aria. Aria. Come on, we're walking.
I'm glad you called. I'm here if you need to speak again. - Bye-bye.
did you sign up for an extra shift?
I could use the help.
no, I'm... on my way to a birthday party.
but I got your message about a missing transcript page, and turns out I did stick it in my folder, by accident.
I'm glad you found it. Can I ask you something?
crisis hotline. Can I help you?
can you speak up, please?
crisis hotline. Can I help you?
I-I called there yesterday.
were you the person who I spoke to? - Yes.
well... I've made a decision, and-- and I'm not waiting.
I have to take care of this tonight.
but I just...
keep seeing her face and how hard it's gonna be...
to lose her... forever.
Lucas! Are you up there?
we will find somewhere.
it's a small town, Byron.
where do you want us to go for a bowl of pasta, Delaware?
listen, if you would let me go to the police, we could eat anywhere we wanted to.
can we not have that conversation right here on the town square?
Hey! - Hey, Ron!
how are you? - Hi.
we thought you guys were still overseas. Oh, yeah, we just got back last week.
the kids have been craving cheesesteaks ever since we hit the tarmac, so...
boy, Aria, you-- you've really grown up! - No. Well, apparently not that much.
Holden, hey, look who's here.
Hey. How's it going? - Good.
at least say it in Portuguese. Pretend you learned something.
Oh, no, he doesn't have to impress us. You taught Aria how to ride a bike. That's plenty.
no, he... didn't teach me, actually.
true, I...broke her training wheels and then she figured out the rest.
Hey, would you guys like to come over for dinner next weekend? We can all cook together.
Yeah. That'll give Aria and Holden some time to get caught up.
Oh, um, Han, did you really order 12 pizzas with green peppers on 'em?
no. Why?
that's what you got. - And Noel's allergic.
Caleb's almost here! He's early!
who comes to their own surprise party early?
I haven't even hung the banner yet!
Hey, I'll do it.
Hanna, will you please just look at this picture. "A" has been here. "A" has been in this house.
I can't deal with this right now.
why is this phone not working?
the dolls were up there!
my attic might be "A's" secret headquarters.
please just go upstairs, look at that wallpaper- - That wallpaper has been up there for 200 years.
it can wait another day.
did you just get here?
check out this cake.
Hanna really went all out.
when she loves somebody, she doesn't hold back.
Yeah. I know. I know. Caleb's a really lucky guy.
so are you.
when you're Hanna's friend, she forgives a lot.
please don't do something you're gonna regret, Lucas.
Finally! You're here! You have to come up to the attic with me.
wait. I think I just made things worse with Lucas.
I think he knows that I knew it was him on the phone.
okay, we've got to get him out of here.
will you please speak to Hanna? She's not listening to me.
where is she?
Mona. Hey. Have you seen Hanna?
do you know where she is?
Yeah, she and Lucas just went to set up the fireworks.
what? Where? - At the pier across the lake.
they took the boat. Did they need permission?
you know, we're running out of time.
maybe we should just hang the sign and forget the fireworks.
Hanna. - What?
Lucas. What are you looking at? Why did you stop?
what's going on?
do your arms hurt?
here, switch with me. I'll row.
sit down.
Hanna! Where are you?
do you think Caleb's here?
come on, let's just go back.
we are not going anywhere.
let's just forget the sign.
okay, I'm getting really cold. I just want to go back.
can you please turn this around?
Hanna, answer me! - Don't answer that.
Lucas, will you please just turn this around?
damn it, Hanna, this is hard enough for me to do, and I need to do this right now.
forget the fireworks, forget the sign, forget everything.
okay, if I asked too much, if I took advantage of you, I'm sorry...!
this is not about the stupid fireworks, Hanna!
I can't see anything. Can you see anything?
no, I can hear things, and that's enough.
Hanna! Answer us!
let's get in the car. They're probably at the pier.
no, Emily, it's a winding road. By the time that we get around- - Well, we have to do something, okay?
Hanna, answer us!
I'm calling the police.
go inside. Go!
Hey, there, it's Ezra.
can't talk, but you can, soon as you hear the...
Hi, it's me.
so, I still don't know what to say about my dad, but...
I think that my mom might be coming around.
she stopped my dad from calling the cops. That's-- that's a good sign, right?
this is not a goodbye call, this is just a please be patient call. I miss
Hey. What's up?
well, your father and I invited Holden and his family over for dinner Sunday.
great.
I was actually just on the phone with Holden.
Really? - Yep.
did he call you? - No. I called him.
we were just thinking about maybe getting together and seeing a movie or something.
but if I'm still grounded...
well, let me talk to your dad about it.
it it's Holden, you know, it might be okay.
a couple were missing, they said.
Oh, look! - Who's out there?
Oh, my God! Han, what happened?
Hanna, come here. Are you okay?
Where's Lucas? - Where's Lucas?
somebody get a blanket! Hurry!
I've got you. - Is she okay?
she swam back!
what's going on?
why is everybody out here?
where were you? We took a dip.
what?
nice night for it.
is Lucas still out there?
what's going on?
surprise.
Oh, my gosh.
no, look, look, look.
dolls?
this is the police! Stay where you are!
they set us up!
I wish I could see those bitches right now.
there's nothing left to link us to that night.
what I want is for you to forget about me.
if you really want to worry about somebody, why don't you worry about your sister and that cop boyfriend of hers.
I'm in love with your daughter.
this was going on while you were her teacher?
you are gonna leave this house right now. - Dad!
we're moving back to Rosewood-- Me, Isabel, Kate.
I want the box that Jason gave Aria.
well, you're not gonna get it. We're not gonna be making any kind of a deal with "A.
a took the bait.
want to make a deal?
you're afraid we found something, something in this box.
No! Emily!
that's "A's" cellphone!
how hard did you hit him-- her-- it?
didn't run like a her.
I thoug it was an animal. - It was. Is.
okay, where is the box?
you guys, this phone is locked.
and where were you guys? I thought we were supposed to meet up here.
wasn't that the plan? - I'm so sorry, Em.
I-I dropped a huge bomb at home. My parents won't let me go anywhere. I had to crawl through Mike's window.
and Toby came in and totally cornered me with all of these questions about why I was acting this way, and he would not leave without any answers.
Kate's moving to Rosewood.
What?!
Yeah, my dad and Isabel got married, and now they're looking for a house here in Rosewood.
so now I have more than one monster in my life. Okay? I win.
no, you don't! I was almost killed!
these are not highlights, Hanna. This is glass in my hair!
you guys, can you talk to me for a second? I'm holding "A's" phone in my hand. What are we doing with it?
something, before "A" knows we have it. - Stand still.
Hanna, call Caleb! - Why?
he's the best way that we can get information off of this.
leave him out of this.
but he's our best shot at tracing this back to "A.
there are other people. We'll take it to the phone store tomorrow.
the-- the phone store?
well, then, call technical support! We can have someone in Pakistan do it!
this can't wait until tomorrow.
once "A" realizes it's missing--!
I get it, okay?
but this phone is connected to Jenna and officer Garrett.
Caleb already has bad history with her and the police. We're not going there!
okay, but if he can find something that finally nails the two of them together-- at least consider it.
Hanna, come on, think this through. - I am.
okay, you done thinking? 'Cause we're running out of time here.
wait, is Caleb still crashing with Lucas? Where's Lucas' house?
I'll go over right-- - Spencer, stop giving us orders! We're not your winged monkeys!
guys, stop!
there's got to be a way that we can get Caleb to help without- - Answer it.
answer it.
answer it! - Why me?
I've got glass in my hair!
I'll answer it! What do you want me to say?
should we tell them that we have the phone?
they'll know that when you say hello.
it's blocked.
I've got Caleb's number! I'm calling him! - Go!
what's that number?
tells me how much data is currently loaded on the phone.
it's a lot.
you mean like photos, videos...?
definitely more than angry birds.
and how long will it take to download?
we're not there yet.
Hanna. You all right? - Yeah.
all right, can somebody tell me whose phone this is? - We can't. Yet.
the less you know right now, the better.
O-kay. Well, then, can somebody at least tell me why Emily smells like a bag of mulch?
wait. Something just came up.
crap. - What does it say?
phone got bricked. - Translate, please.
the owner shut down the phone from their computer.
so we lost everything? - We never had everything.
I have some files, but they're locked and they're probably corrupted.
I can try and retrieve what I have, but it's gonna take a while.
are you sure you want me to work on this? - Yes!
Hanna, are you all right with this?
morning.
um, where are you going? - School.
wearing that? - Yeah. What are you talking about?
well, that's not appropriate for school, so... change your clothes.
since when have I had a dress code, dad?
since we became aware of who you might be dressing for, so change your clothes.
okay, well, what am I supposed to wear, a down parka?
Byron, I've-- I've got this.
if I were you, I'd pick and choose my battles.
since when did wearing knee-highs become a battle?
today is not the day to question your father. - Why?
he, of all people, coming down on me for an inappropriate relationship?
Aria! - I'm sorry.
I just thought maybe at least...
you would... - That I would what?
that I would give my teenage daughter and Mr. Fitz my blessing?
your father and I are in agreement here because we were lied to for a really long time by you and by a colleague.
well, I didn't tell you guys because I was scared that you would react-- react like this.
Yeah, well, evidently you know us a lot better than we know you, but that's gonna change 'cause you're gonna be spending a lot more time with your family and a lot less time with your friends.
what does Ezra have to do with my friends?
and you're gonna be cutting him off completely, and that means not even saying goodbye.
is that clear?
do you like him? - What?
do you like him? - I did.
Hi.
Hey, could we talk?
can we do it someplace a little bit more private?
look, I know that you want answers, and I'm close, I'm so close to giving them to you, but it's... It's just still not safe.
then why did you come here?
because I missed you.
shutting you out is killing me.
so you came here to tell me you can't be here.
Hey! - Hey, you.
what are you working on?
you and your friends gave me homework, remember?
you're doing that here?
nobody knows what I'm working on.
so, uh, when do I get inducted into this secret society?
Hey, I like playing Mission: Impossible as much as the next guy, but, uh, I'm starting to feel like somebody doesn't trust me.
who? Me? Caleb! Come on, I trust you.
but... not with this.
we have gotten naked together in more ways than one, Han.
why are we suddenly strangers when it comes to a stolen phone?
it wasn't stolen; We found it.
why don't I believe that?
Oh, hey, Lucas!
are we still on for after school?
you know, I might be... Please don't bag on me.
okay, if I don't get at least a B-plus on this test... Please. Please. Please.
fine. I can give you, like, an hour.
you're a good man, Lucas.
so, can we talk about this phone stuff later? - Maybe.
see you at lunch.
I don't-- I don't get it!
I don't understand, Jenna!
Hey, hey! Can we not do this on the phone, please? Please, I'm outside your house.
stop punishing me and just open the damn door!
please!
what is going on?
it's been like Fight Club since last night.
they were arguing on the porch. She slammed the door in his face.
this started last night?
I think it's nerves. Jenna plays it cool, but she's freaking about having the eye operation.
yeah? Well, that's what happens when it's not just the two of us.
no, no, the mistake was pulling in somebody else.
asking him to help us was a bad idea, Jenna.
it was a bad move. No, no, I warned you. No. It was your idea.
this doesn't sound like it's about an eye operation. Who is "he"? Who are they talking about?
just-- can you-- can you wait just a second? Jenna, don't hang up.
Jenna, no, wait. Just wait a second. Don't hang up, just come to the door.
damn it!
Emily, you've got about five more minutes.
is there any way I can take this on Monday?
I didn't have time to finish the last few chapters.
it's a makeup test, Emily.
the class has moved on to another book.
what about after school tomorrow?
I can't. I have community service. They gave me additional hours for... fighting with Spencer.
are you still picking up trash? - Phone calls.
it's a community crisis hotline, and today is my first day.
well, you girls seem to have a lot of experience with crises.
maybe you can help someone learn how to avoid them.
how 'bout after school on Monday?
what else do I not know about my daughter?
I don't know what you mean.
wasn't fair of me to ask that. Sorry.
Aria's the same person she's always been, someone you can be proud of.
nothing's changed.
Hey, there, it's Ezra. Can't talk, but you can, soon as you hear the...
Hi, it's me.
,I'm using Hanna's phone 'cause I'm scared my dad's gonna start combing through my phone bills.
it's still pretty intense, but...
but that doesn't mean it can't change. They're gonna come around. I-I know that they will.
I love you so much. I hate not being able to see you.
Thanks.
Hey. How was your test?
I'm doing a makeup of a makeup.
I've got to run. Community service starts at 4 P. M.sharp.
wait. Yours is today? I was hoping you'd be able to come snoop around Jason's house with me.
Jason's? Why Jason?
well, if Jenna and Garrett have a helper, and it's a he, where does your mind go?
it's going to community service. Ask Aria.
I did. She's under house arrest. And besides, she really believes that Jason's been out of town for weeks.
offer her your lake house. She needs some serious face time with Caleb.
my lake house? - I've already made some memories on that couch in the living room.
she-- she didn't tell you?
that was my Nana's couch.
so, who ditched the Union first? South Carolina? Did we make a card for them?
Hello? What's going on?
um, sorry, I was just...
uh, thinking about Louisiana.
please don't check out on me.
okay, I need you. I can't even spell "Louisiana.
is that Caleb? - Spencer.
why don't we have a card for Maryland?
border state-- didn't secede until after the war began.
what was that about?
uh, she offered me and Caleb her lake house.
and you're not interested?
Oh, I'm interested, but if I wait an hour, she might throw in maid service, and if I wait two hours, she might send a helicopter to take us there.
I'm gonna make a new card for Virginia.
or if I waited three hours, she might let me have Caleb's birthday party there.
Oh, my God, that's awesome-- a surprise party at the lake house!
Oh, look. We have two cards for North Carolina.
Lucas, you could help me. We could do it together.
no, no, you don't need me.
of course I need you. You're, like, his best friend.
you're roomies. You're like Patrick and Spongebob.
look, Hanna, if we're not gonna study, I really need to get going.
that lake house is perfect. It's secluded.
there's a dock, a rowboat, a pier, and, you know, we could hang a big sign there.
that sounds really fun... and pricey.
I'm not really in a position to pitch in.
no. No, I'll pay for everything.
I just need your help.
Caleb's probably never even had a birthday party before.
and if we do this, it would mean a lot to him.
you'll find a contract in the back of the packet.
every volunteer must sign it.
this protects you and the caller.
there must be anonymity on both sides of the phone.
you look overwhelmed. Relax.
none of you will be answering any calls until you've had some training.
keep in mind, most of the time they really just need someone to listen.
so, who wants to read with me?
Emily? Here. Help me out.
this is a transcript of a call that came in last night. Ready?
crisis hotline. Can I help you?
I need to talk to someone.
I was asked to do something important, and I tried my best, but I screwed it up.
you don't understand. It's gone, and I can't get it back.
all I could do is shut it down.
shut what down? Can you tell me exactly what you've lost?
did this person call here last night? And was it a man or a woman?
not relevant. Let's continue.
Emily... You okay?
what?
sorry.
may I come in?
Ella and I once went to a party in this building, back in grad school days.
do you want some water, or a-- a beer? - No, no thanks.
I, uh, I've been thinking a lot since you came over to our house.
Yeah, yeah, Byron, I- - No, let-- let me get this out.
I've been teaching for 17 years.
I know how tricky it can be to navigate some teacherstudent relationships, and I have made some bad choices that I later regretted, though it didn't involve a minor.
and I also know that my daughter went through a very traumatic year...
and that you were there for her...
in a way her parents couldn't be.
but that doesn't make it okay.
so, before I leave here tonight, I want your assurance that this was a mistake, and that it's over, and that you will never see Aria again.
look, as soon as I realized she was my student, I knew it was wrong.
which is why I took the job at Hollis.
you giving that to me was an incredible gift, and I...
has she been here?
sorry, what?
is this where you spent your time together?
Byron, as I said-- I heard what you said.
I don't think you heard me.
you're never seeing Aria again. Ever.
and I will make sure that the police see to that.
okay, so, clarification: Is our invitation coming by snail-mail?
what?
did you send it to my address or hers?
I didn't think you'd want to come.
to a rockin' party at Spencer's lake house?
I can see where you'd be confused.
we'll be there.
Yeah, um, it's a surprise party. For... Caleb.
surprise!
he and I are friends now. All is forgiven.
I almost got caught tonight.
it's gone, and I can't get it back. I might as well be dead.
tell me that does not sound like "A's" helper.
they let you keep this? - No! They don't know I have it.
okay, so I have good news and I have bad news.
have you seen this? - Are you kidding?
I woke up to it. Emily taped it to our bathroom mirror.
we knew that it wasn't Jenna in the greenhouse, but now it looks like it wasn't- - it was her drone.
okay, I think that we should all be working at this crisis hotline.
I mean, if "A's" helper calls back, we can- - Nnnn...No. No.
I can't work at a hotline. I'm on lockdown.
I can barely even pee without a chaperone.
wait, you're coming to my surprise party, right?
Nope, not unless you're throwing it in my closet.
Hey, guys, you got a minute?
I finally cracked one of these files...
but I'm guessing that wasn't what you were looking for.
what are you looking for? - No, this is-- this is really great.
could you please forward this picture to all of us?
I really have to get to class.
Thanks, Caleb. - Yeah, thank you.
Hanna, what else happened when I was in California?
you, your friends, everyone's acting really strange-- even Lucas.
no one's looking me in the eye.
well, I'm looking at you, and I'm wondering what to get you for your birthday dinner.
we can get takeout, just for the two of us.
what do you want?
how 'bout a big, steaming plate of the truth, starting with this found phone.
no, Caleb, I didn't lie about that.
I just can't say any more.
and you don't think that's a problem for us?
no, it's not a problem.
we don't have a problem, do we?
we do if you're holding back the important stuff.
that's not the important stuff.
this is the important stuff.
I mean, he actually stood there in front of me justifying his behavior.
you should have been there. - Yes, I should have.
well, I followed an-- an impulse, Ella.
what are you looking for? - An aspirin!
how did this family go from a happy Christmas card in Europe to this fractured, deceitful mess?
Ella, don't give me that. Stop.
you know,"greetings from dysfunction junction.
that one can't go to school because he's too depressed, and this one only goes so she can date her teacher.
all right, that's it. I'm calling the police.
no, you're not. - Why not?
because we have a daughter whose reputation will be ruined just as much as his.
she just got done doing community service last week!
Ella, I really think-- - No! Stop!
it is hard enough for her to walk through this town.
the bell tower, and then the shovel.
do you really want to subject your daughter to more police scrutiny?
do you want to see him get away with this? - Of course not.
but before we pick up our torches and pitchforks, let's take a moment and figure it out.
I want to protect Aria.
we raised her to be independent and open-minded, and we don't get to be shocked if that is now who she is.
Mr. Fitz? - Hanna.
what are you doing here?
Oh, I picked up a birthday cake from the bakery around the corner.
actually, could you please leave that open?
Yeah, sure.
look, I know what's going down with Aria's parents, and...
I just want to say that the rest of us don't feel the same way.
two people who love each other that much should be together.
crisis hotline. Can I help you?
Yes, we did. How are you today?
I'm glad you reached out again. Has the situation gotten worse?
much.
I'm in way too deep. I had to do something. I-I don't have a choice.
we always have choices.
no, no. I should have known better.
I just... I just got sucked in, and it made me feel like...
like I finally had some power, and now I-I just can't make this go away without...
that's Lucas!
I never wanted to hurt anybody, but now I have to.
take a breath.
maybe I can help you come up with a solution.
no, there is only one solution, and it's not gonna be pretty.
I know what I have to do.
I just... hate to do it.
Hanna... This is more important than a perfect bow.
just listen to us. - We both heard the voice.
it was definitely Lucas on the other end.
no, you both heard what you wanted to hear.
Lucas may be able to get his hands on illegal firecrackers, but that don'n't mean he's "A's" evil elf.
Hanna, you don't know that, okay? Lucas hated Alison just as much as Jenna did.
she could have easily recruited him. It wouldn't take a whole lot of persuasion.
no. He has been an incredible friend to me.
he brought Caleb back to town. He's now helping me throw this party.
so he can play you. So he can gain your trust.
I mean, for all we know, he still sees Alison whenever he looks at us.
no, he's over that.
okay, well, maybe "A" is pressuring Lucas just like "A" did with us.
I mean, if "A" has something on him- - Did you record this conversation?
do you have any other proof? - No, of course not.
well, then, drop it.
Hanna! It was Lucas that was in the greenhouse.
that's who dropped the phone. That's who you hit with your car.
Really? Did you see bruises through the telephone too?
Lucas has had my back for a long time, okay?
he may have had an axe to grind with Alison, but which one of us didn't?
Hanna. - No.
just leave it alone.
he's too easy of a target.
Hello? - Ezra.
you shouldn't be calling here.
no, I-I know. I really needed to hear your I know. Me too.
but you can't call here any more.
was she alone?
was there anybody else in that car going to Boston with Jenna?
I have no idea.
that was supposed to be me in that car with her.
what happened? - I don't know.
she turned on me, Toby. - She does that.
all I ever did was everything she asked me to do, and one day, she decides that's not enough.
when Jenna doesn't need people any more, she gets rid of them.
all I said was, this town is not good for her, and I just wish we could get out of here-- y-you know, move on.
maybe she's having too much fun settling scores.
Hey, your stepsister's been through a lot, all right?
if it were me and I had to learn everything all over again, I'd be curled up in some corner.
she makes the rest of us look like cowards.
I never questioned her strength, just how she uses it.
Yeah, well, you don't understand her.
you're right, I don't.
but it looks like she found some new friends who do.
Oh, yeah? Who are her friends?
you could just walk away, Garrett. I did.
the difference is, I'm in love with her. And if I have to keep proving that to her, I will.
are you sure they're up here? - Yes.
my mom bought, like, a zillion tiki torches for my dad's 40th, so they've got to be up here somewhere.
is it worth taking a second shower for?
what is all this stuff?
well, the furniture is my Nana's, and the spiders, they came with the house.
that's the food. Keep looking, I'll be right back. - Okay.
Oh, my God. "A's" been up here.
Hanna, is that you? - It's me.
what are you doing here?
looking for some tools.
Why?
to hang the birthday banner.
Yeah, but... Why up here? How did you... even know to come up here?
I just... figured they would be stored up here.
you know, some people...
some people like to store their tools in the attic.
Yeah. We don't.
did Mike need us to pick him up? - No.
Gavin's mom was gonna take him home. They were gonna stop and get a pizza.
you know what? We'll eat somewhere else.
Byron... - No, there are other restaurants.
Aria, come on, we're not staying here. - Mom.
let's just go somewhere else.
Aria. Aria. Come on, we're walking.
I'm glad you called. I'm here if you need to speak again. - Bye-bye.
did you sign up for an extra shift?
I could use the help.
no, I'm... on my way to a birthday party.
but I got your message about a missing transcript page, and turns out I did stick it in my folder, by accident.
I'm glad you found it. Can I ask you something?
crisis hotline. Can I help you?
can you speak up, please?
crisis hotline. Can I help you?
I-I called there yesterday.
were you the person who I spoke to? - Yes.
well... I've made a decision, and-- and I'm not waiting.
I have to take care of this tonight.
but I just...
keep seeing her face and how hard it's gonna be...
to lose her... forever.
Lucas! Are you up there?
we will find somewhere.
it's a small town, Byron.
where do you want us to go for a bowl of pasta, Delaware?
listen, if you would let me go to the police, we could eat anywhere we wanted to.
can we not have that conversation right here on the town square?
Hey! - Hey, Ron!
how are you? - Hi.
we thought you guys were still overseas. Oh, yeah, we just got back last week.
the kids have been craving cheesesteaks ever since we hit the tarmac, so...
boy, Aria, you-- you've really grown up! - No. Well, apparently not that much.
Holden, hey, look who's here.
Hey. How's it going? - Good.
at least say it in Portuguese. Pretend you learned something.
Oh, no, he doesn't have to impress us. You taught Aria how to ride a bike. That's plenty.
no, he... didn't teach me, actually.
true, I...broke her training wheels and then she figured out the rest.
Hey, would you guys like to come over for dinner next weekend? We can all cook together.
Yeah. That'll give Aria and Holden some time to get caught up.
Oh, um, Han, did you really order 12 pizzas with green peppers on 'em?
no. Why?
that's what you got. - And Noel's allergic.
Caleb's almost here! He's early!
who comes to their own surprise party early?
I haven't even hung the banner yet!
Hey, I'll do it.
Hanna, will you please just look at this picture. "A" has been here. "A" has been in this house.
I can't deal with this right now.
why is this phone not working?
the dolls were up there!
my attic might be "A's" secret headquarters.
please just go upstairs, look at that wallpaper- - That wallpaper has been up there for 200 years.
it can wait another day.
did you just get here?
check out this cake.
Hanna really went all out.
when she loves somebody, she doesn't hold back.
Yeah. I know. I know. Caleb's a really lucky guy.
so are you.
when you're Hanna's friend, she forgives a lot.
please don't do something you're gonna regret, Lucas.
Finally! You're here! You have to come up to the attic with me.
wait. I think I just made things worse with Lucas.
I think he knows that I knew it was him on the phone.
okay, we've got to get him out of here.
will you please speak to Hanna? She's not listening to me.
where is she?
Mona. Hey. Have you seen Hanna?
do you know where she is?
Yeah, she and Lucas just went to set up the fireworks.
what? Where? - At the pier across the lake.
they took the boat. Did they need permission?
you know, we're running out of time.
maybe we should just hang the sign and forget the fireworks.
Hanna. - What?
Lucas. What are you looking at? Why did you stop?
what's going on?
do your arms hurt?
